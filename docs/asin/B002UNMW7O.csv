1290051,ARNAOSKQZMM2J,B002UNMW7O,Amanda,"[2, 3]","Expectations were high. After 10 years, the much-anticipated sequel to the cult-hit classic Boondock Saints finally crawled out of development hell, made it to the big screen and now, onto Blu-ray. The buzz around the sequel, however, seemed largely fan-generated, and hopes were high that this sequel, likely too late, would live up to the original.Personally, I was skeptical. It's incredibly difficult to imagine a follow-up that could do the original justice, and since this movie had been in the works for so long (heck, there was some speculation that it was going to come out in 2005) that I was afraid that it would, frankly, not be very good. My hopes were sparked, however, when it was confirmed that much of the talent from the original was returning: Troy Duffy, Norman Reedus, amd Sean Patrick Flanery. Perhaps some of the magic would be rekindled with all of these names back in the game.The result was mixed. Some fans thought it was the perfect follow-up, others thought it was horrid. I admit that I fell somewhere in the middle. I enjoyed it as a decent action movie with some fun one-liners, thought it was a fairly acceptable sequel, but, deep down, I think that the franchise would have been perfectly fine without this movie.In All Saints' Day, fraternal twins Conner (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Norman Reedus) , known as ""The Saints,"" are living a quiet life in Ireland with their father after leaving Boston prior to their stint as mobster-killing vigilantes. They soon realize that the quiet country life isn't for them and that it's time to clear their names, so they head back to Boston to continue fighting the mob. Around the same time as their arrival, a priest is killed in a manner similar to that of The Saints (this becomes a revenge motive for the MacManus brothers). FBI Agent Eunice Bloom (Julie Benz) steps in to investigate, working with local detectives (and familiar faces) Duffy (Brian Mahoney), Dolly (David Ferry) and Greenly (Bob Marley). She quickly concludes that the crime was committed by a copy-cat, but as the crimes become more frequent, it becomes obvious that the real Saints are back in town.By far, Julie Benz steals the show in every scene she appears in. Though it quickly becomes apparent that she is, essentially, William Defoe's character Paul Smecker from the first movie, Benz plays a fun, believable character with a sweet southern accent who is ""so f*ing smart"" that she ""makes smart people feel retarded."" By the time I was halfway through the movie, I just couldn't get enough of her. The returning characters seemed to easily fall back into their roles, particularly Reedus and Flanery. But sadly, it just wasn't the same without William Defoe, who, in my opinion, was one of the best parts of the first movie. Even though he does make a cameo at the very end (and it implies that he will return in a supposed third movie), it just wasn't the same.The screen writing was as fun as I remember the first movie being, complete with one-liners and curse-laden dialog. Sadly though, the first half of the movie or so just felt like a recycled version of the first, with a plot that I had definitely seen before and that frequently threatened to be stale and/or boring. It did pick up in the second half though, with more action, more surprises and a somewhat unexpected ending that, while enjoyable, felt sadly disjointed from the earlier parts of the movie, almost like the there was a big gap between when the first and second halves of the movie were written.While I didn't have the opportunity to see the movie in theaters (it seemed to come and go pretty quickly), I got to enjoy it in full-blown Blu-ray glory. While the film itself felt a little low budget and old (as in, it felt a little bit like it was released in the 90s), the picture and sound quality were top-rate, particularly in the action sequences, where it felt like bullets were flying at me through the screen.The Blu-ray edition of Boondock Saints II is presented in lovely 1080p and 2.35:1 high definition. The Blu-ray includes French, Portuguese, and Spanish audio, as well a English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles.The special features are pretty generous, particularly on the Blu-ray version. They include a collection of very short deleted scenes, a 25 minutes behind-the-scenes feature discussing the franchise's popularity, a funny sit down with Connelly and Duffy, and (exclusive to Blu-ray) a special behind-the-scenes and interview feature, a ten minute piece on the weapons used in both films (ideal if you're into the guns), and a 60 minute feature on Comic Con.Overall, All Saints Day can be approached as a fun action flick, but may rub some hardcore fans the wrong way. While I personally feel like the movie was a bit of a disappointment, I'm glad I at least watched it.",3,Boondock Saints 2 -Blu-ray,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,4849,"['Expectations', 'were', 'high',

The acting could have been a bit better, but Julie Benz is a fun watch. The movie lacks the originality of the first, which takes away from this shoot 'em up style revenge flick.

1290057,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B002UNMW7O,Anthony Pittore,"[0, 1]","In the documentary 'Overnight,' fans of 'The Boondock Saints' were shown how writer/director Troy Duffy truly was: an abrasive, insulting jerk with little respect for anyone or anything. Because of his behaviour, he alienated himself with the Weinstein brothers and, even though he was supposed to be the ""next big thing,"" he basically destroyed his chance at Hollywood success and fans lost their chance at a sequel to one of the best action flicks of our time. Nine years later, however, the much-awaited sequel was finally given to loyal fans.Unfortunately, it was a total mess.The story starts when a Boston priest's murder is staged to look like the work of the Saints. As expected, the Saints come out of retirement from their sanctuary in Ireland and, with the help of a new friend, head back to Beantown to set the record straight. Meeting with a couple of old acquaintances and making some new ones along the way, the Saints hunt down their copycat and fight some new members of the Yakavetta mafia (including Breakfast Club's Judd Nelson, hilariously enough).What Troy Duffy was thinking as he was making this movie is just beyond me. This sequel seems like a way of slapping the faces of all the fans that have been begging him for a new movie for the past nine years. After seeing his personality in 'Overnight,' it wouldn't be a surprise if this was his actual goal. Just about every single technical element is rotten from the inside out. The first most noticeable fault is the tremendously bad acting. Other than the Saints, just about everyone delivers irritating and hammy performances throughout (even the bigger name actors like Julie Benz from 'Dexter'). The characters' dialogue doesn't help matters much as it seems like Duffy came up with a few random jokes and tried to build the entire script around them instead of just letting the humour flow nicely like he did with the first film's script. Random slapstick is tossed in that is more embarrassing than funny. There was simply just too much humour . Duffy's direction is stale and unimpressive which makes it obvious his long absence from the director's chair was hugely damaging to his talent. What makes all of these elements worse is the fact that there's not enough great Saints action to make up for them. In the first, there were a few minour acting and writing issues and such, but no one could possibly care because the action and direction were so fantastic. Unfortunately, there isn't much here to make the negative elements worth it.Overall, I guess the best thing about this film is that it makes the original that much better by comparison.Final Verdict: 4/10, generous and only for the Saints.-AP3-",2,We had to wait a decade for THIS?,1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,2689,"['documentary', ""'Overnight"", 'fans', ""'The"", 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'were', 'shown', 'how', 'writer/director', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'truly', 'was', 'abrasive', 'insulting', 'jerk', 'little', 'respect', 'anyone', 'anything', 'behaviour', 'alienated', 'Weinstein', 'brothers', 'even', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'basically', 'destroyed', 'chance', 'Hollywood', 'success', 'fans', 'lost', 'chance', 'sequel', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'flicks', 'time', 'Nine', 'years', 'later', 'however', 'much-awaited', 'sequel', 'was', 'finally', 'given', 'loyal', 'fans.Unfortunately', 'was', 'total', 'mess.The', 'story', 'when', 'Boston', 'priest', 'murder', 'staged', 'look', 'work', 'Saints', 'expected', 'Saints', 'come', 'retirement', 'sanctuary', 'Ireland', 'help', 'new', 'friend', 'head', 'back', 'Beantown', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'Meeting', 'couple', 'old', 'acquaintances', 'making', 'new', 'ones', 'way', 'Saints', 'hunt', 'down', 'copycat', 'fight', 'new', 'members', 'Yakavetta', 'mafia', 'including', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'hilariously', 'enough', '.What', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'making', 'movie', 'just', 'sequel', 'way', 'slapping', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'begging', 'new', 'movie', 'past', 'nine', 'years', 'seeing', 'personality', ""'Overnight"", 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprise', 'was', 'actual', 'goal', 'Just', 'single', 'technical', 'element', 'rotten', 'inside', 'first', 'most', 'noticeable', 'fault', 'tremendously', 'bad', 'acting', 'Other', 'Saints', 'just', 'everyone', 'delivers', 'irritating', 'hammy', 'performances', 'even', 'bigger', 'name', 'actors', 'Julie', 'Benz', ""'Dexter"", 'characters', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'much', 'Duffy', 'came', 'up', 'few', 'random', 'jokes', 'tried', 'build', 'entire', 'script', 'instead', 'just', 'letting', 'humour', 'flow', 'nicely', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'script', 'Random', 'slapstick', 'tossed', 'more', 'embarrassing', 'funny', 'was', 'simply', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'humour', 'Duffy', 'direction', 'stale', 'unimpressive', 'obvious', 'long', 'absence', 'director', 'chair', 'was', 'hugely', 'damaging', 'talent', 'What', 'elements', 'fact', 'not', 'enough', 'great', 'Saints', 'action', 'make', 'up', 'first', 'were', 'few', 'minour', 'acting', 'writing', 'issues', 'such', 'one', 'could', 'possibly', 'care', 'action', 'direction', 'were', 'so', 'fantastic', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'much', 'here', 'make', 'negative', 'elements', 'worth', 'it.Overall', 'guess', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'original', 'much', 'better', 'comparison.Final', 'Verdict', '4/10', 'generous', 'only', 'Saints.-AP3-']",The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day

1290059,A13EXRHJH2ANRN,B002UNMW7O,Arora Martin,"[0, 1]","When I first heard that there was finally a sequel to the original Boondock Saints I could not have been more excited!! That was one of the most thrilling, fun, humorous, and insightful movies I have ever seen. But the sequel....The ending to the first gave the impression that they would continue on as the vengeful voice of the people who are fed up with crime bosses getting away with anything. Only to find out in the sequel that they RAN AWAY right after that public spectacle of vigilantism?? It made no sense!There were a LOT of things that just reminded me of the first movie only not as well done (the idiotic side kick, the FBI agent ally, the moronic Boston cops).The only thing I think this movie stayed true to is the relationship between the brothers. Their loyalty and affection for each other above all is remarkable. Also, their constant bickering which causes problems for the characters generally leads to huge laughs for the audience.Another thing I couldn't help but notice was that Sean Patrick Flanery has not aged well. Each time they gave him full face shot I couldn't help but think of the Santa Claus movie where Tim Allen gets puffy cheeks and a beard to become Santa- SPF looked like he was undergoing the same change!

I've got BOONDOCK SAINTS I and II, and both are excellent. The acting, the occasional humor, the action and the script for both these very underated movies is just wonderful.SPOILER: If you haven't seen BOONDOCK SAINTS (the first movie, please don't go any farther but go ahead and buy it, rent it, whatever - you won't be sorry. You really do need to see the first one, though, to understand and appreciate in total the second one.)Basic plot: Two Irish brothers, through a kind of vision from God, become a sort of modern day Robin Hoods, going after the nastier criminal element of Boston. In BS II, they are in Ireland and a death of a priest, done as a message to them, brings them back to town with a new sidekick and the fun begins again. The wonderful Willem Defoe is in the first movie. His replacement, Julie Benz, was such a shock that it took a couple of viewings for me to really appreciate her. Both she and Defoe are FBI agents in the most bizaare context. I have no other way to put that. The brothers, Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are perfect for the roles, as is their father, played by Billy Connolly. I've heard talk of a third movie being made but if so, it isn't in production yet.While I don't really care to talk about two movies in one review, it is necessary in this case.

McVay ""Writer""","[50, 68]","I've seen the movie twice on the big screen and will still have to have the DVD for home viewing because the cheers and laughter of my 'frenzied' fellow movie goers drowned out some of the dialogue in places. I refuse to compare this film to the first because it can stand on its own as more than just another action film, it is a work of Art on the screen with all the tragedy, depth, symbolism, brotherly love, witty dialogue, tension, and purpose of one of Shakespeare's plays, only with a modern day twist. There are some scenes that only my 'Chitty-chitty bang bang' and 'Starsky and Hutch' generation may 'get', but that's o.k. Makes me feel special. Clifton Collins Jr. and Julie Benz stole every scene they were in! Rather than attempt to have Benz fill the big shoes of Willem Dafoe, Duffy brilliantly gave us a smart, unique character who stands out in her own high heels. We also are filled in on a glimpse of the back story for Connolly's character as the father; why he became a hit man who preys on mobsters and how he was caught. I felt more sympathy this time around for the father and his losses, as well as a deeper understanding of why the brothers were compelled to take on their mission. Not only is this a great continuation of a fantastic cult classic, it gives the audience a deeper look into the Saints.

However, their life in exile is rudely interrupted when they receive word that a priest in Boston has been murdered using their signature 'two in the back of the head and pennies over the eyes' method. Disgusted by this slur on their 'mission', the brothers head back to Boston armed to the teeth and with vengeance on their minds - but unbeknownst to the brothers, forcing their return is just the first step in an audacious plan initiated by an old enemy...If you enjoyed Troy Duffy's original ""Boondock Saints"", then I fail to see why you wouldn't enjoy this sequel, as it really is more of the same albeit with a slightly expanded canvas. Like the first film, it is consistently enjoyable, even if it doesn't entirely work all of the time. Why some fans have taken such umbrage at it, I've no idea; I can only assume that the original has become so much of a cult film in the ten years since it's release that it has been blown out of all proportion in some people's minds.Myself personally, I enjoyed every Garth-Ennis-styled minute of the sequel. Sure, like the original, its nowhere near being the most perfect movie ever made, but I was entertained throughout because, lets face it, its vastly more entertaining than most of the mainstream action fare being made by big budget studios.

They overused similar film techniques used in the first one and replaced william dafoe with some woman who was not even near the caliber of actor.

1290088,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002UNMW7O,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[19, 24]","In 2000, ""The Boondock Saints"" which was written and directed by Troy Duffy received a limited release in only five theaters in one week.  Critically panned, one would think the film would fade to obscurity.  But this was not the case.  Similar to Kevin Smith's ""Clerks"", ""The Boondock Saints"" amassed a huge underground following and had become a cult film grossing $50 million in domestic video sales.The first film revolved around three Catholic Irish anti-heroes - Poppa (played by Bill Connolly) and his two fraternal twin sons Connor (played by Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy (played by Norman Reedus) MacManus who are vigilantes that take on the Russian mafia with their way and their style of vigilante payback.A decade later, with the popularity of the first film, ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" is backed by Sony Pictures and given a nationwide theatrical release in 67 theaters and due to fan demand, more cities were added to the release.  Once again, the critics were not so supportive of the film but yet the fans have once again come to support the film and the film made over $10 million in the box office but now Blu-ray and DVD release will be unleashed to the masses and I have no doubt that once again, ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" is going to do well.In ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"", eight years have passed and after the three men murdered Giuseppe ""Papa Joe"" Yakavetta (and countless members of the mafia).When a priest was murdered, someone tries to frame the Saints and now the police (especially the Saint's friends on the inside) are worried that the Saints who have been quiet are back to cause more mayhem.  The public is still divided on their feelings towards the Saints.Meanwhile, the Saints are called in for their help and to avenge the death of the priest.  As the two travel back to the U.S. by boat, a man named Romeo (played by Clifton Collins Jr.) who has idolized the Saints wants to be part of their crew and needless to say, he has to earn his place amongst the group.As for the police, Greenly (played by Bob Marley), Duffy (played by Brian Mahoney) and Dolly (David Ferry) worry that their friends may be back and with the FBI sending one of their top investigators named Eunice (played by Julie Benz) to assist them, they worry that the FBI may find out that the three detectives assisted the Saints back then.  Eunice is not only intelligent and sexy (easily catching the attention of the three detectives) but she can easily come up in her mind of what happens at a crime scene plus she's also known to be very good with her gun as well.While the Saints look for who killed the priest, the FBI and police looking for the Saints, the media hype has attracted the attention of Conzezio Yakavetta (played by Judd Nelson) who wants revenge for the Saints murdering his father on public television.  So, once again, the Yakavetta family are planning to get their revenge against the Saints.Who will end up victorious?VIDEO:""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  Cinematography by Miroslaw Baszak did a pretty solid job with the overall shots.  The action sequences are well-done, enjoyed the lighting of several of the sequences.  Those well-lighted scenes are vibrant while certain scenes are cold and bluish.  I didn't notice any artifacts, nor did I notice any DNR.  The picture quality has a fine layer of grian, blacks are nice and deep and overall, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment did a solid job in terms of picture quality for the Blu-ray release.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" is presented in English, French (Par) and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  As expected with a film that features guns ablazing, the film does feature a good amount of surround channel usage with the gun shots and bullets zipping through the air.For the most part, dialogue and music is front channel driven but the action sequences definitely put your surround channels to good use and there is also some use of LFE as well.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" comes with the following special features in Standard and High Definition with English Stereo and optional Spanish and Portuguese subtitles:* Audio Commentary with writer/director Troy Duffy, Sean Patrick Flanery, Norman Reedus and Billy Connolly - An entertaining commentary by Troy Duffy and the main cast discussing the film and just having fun discussing the film.* Audio Commentary with writer/director Troy Duffy and Willem Dafoe - Interesting commentary since Willem Dafoe is not seen throughout the majority in the film but it's like listening to two friends having a discussion while watching the film.  But they do touch upon the messed up treatment from the first film and how things were much better in the sequel.* Deleted Scenes - Featuring two deleted scenes: Detectives Mourn Death and Romeo Plays Chess* Unprecedented Access: Behind-the-Scenes Featurette - (25:49) Behind-the-scenes of the making of the film and the director, producer and talent talk about working on this second film.* Billy Connolly & Troy Duffy: Unedited - (9:22) Troy Duffy and Bill Connolly hanging out and Troy explaining how he wanted Bill to become Don and more.  Bill talks about wanting to be part of this film despite his agent not wanting him to be part of it.* Inside the Vault: The Weapon Featurette - (8:28) A Blu-ray exclusive.  Charles Taylor (Heady Armorer) shows us the weapons used on ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"".* The Cast Confesses: Secrets from the Set Featurette -(7:13)  A Blu-ray exclusive.  The cast talks about being reunited for the sequel.  The main cast talk about their characters and behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the film.* The Boondock Saints Hit Comic-Con - (57:02) A Blu-ray Exclusive.  Featuring Troy Duffy and the cast leaving to San Diego Comic Con, the autograph signing and the panel.  A lot of fan excitement and an absolutely awesome special feature!* BD-Live Enabled With movieIQ, you can get real-time information on the cast, music, trivia and more while watching the film.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" is literally an adrenaline pumping, action-packed, kick ass film which I found much better than the first and literally had a lot of fun watching it.What I find interesting is that ""The Boondock Saints"" was a film that didn't even have a chance for a theatrical release but found a humongous cult following on video.  And here we are with the sequel, the critics obviously share a different opinion towards this film but among the viewers, they loved the film.  As for me, I really enjoyed the film and felt this Blu-ray release is awesome!I enjoyed the addition of the new characters, enjoyed the action sequences, the weapons and enjoyed the story of this sequel. It's a much different tone compared to the first film but the film definitely benefits from a slightly higher budget. And the surprise ending... I never saw that coming.  So, I'm really excited for the possibility of a third ""Boondock Saints"" film.It's important to point out to those not familiar with the film is that ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"", the film is more action.  Yes, there is a storyline but for those expecting something deep are probably not going to find it in this sequel.  The performances of the talent may seem off at times and I'm sure many will have issues with the Irish and the Southern accents used by the talents.If anything, I expected nothing but an action-packed film featuring a lot of gun fighting, plenty of action and profanity but I really enjoyed the addition of Clifton Collins Jr. as Romeo and Julie Benz as Eunice.  Collins brings the comedy portion with his character and Julie Benz brings the sexiness.  And both characters definitely kick ass!The Blu-ray release is absolutely fantastic although I can see some fans who have not upgraded to Blu-ray being a bit upset that the Comic-Con featurette (and two other featurettes) are only Blu-ray exclusives but as this is a Sony Pictures  film and there is a move by the industry towards Blu-ray and Blu-ray exclusives not featured on a normal DVD release are to be expected.Overall, ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" was an enjoyable action-based film. A lot of guns,  a lot of violence, a lot of profanity and just overall, a fun film.  There are also a good number of surprises, especially deaths of major characters in this film which was quite surprising.If you enjoyed the first ""Boondock Saints"", you'll definitely enjoy the sequel.  Definitely recommended!",4,Blu-ray:  An enjoyable film and has more (and better) special features than its DVD counterpart!,1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,8742,"['2000', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'was',

This film about two Irish brothers who are vigilantes with a bifurcated means of delivering justice (murder in the name of the Church) was written by brothers Troy and Taylor Duffy (Troy Duffy also directs) from Connecticut whose only credits include the same roles for the 1999 original BOONDOCK SAINTS and paling in their own band named after the movie. It has moments that entertain, but the film is primarily concerned with noise, slaughter, potty mouth dialogue, and confusing use of forward and backward black and white film clips that are supposed to serve clarifying the confusing plot.The McaManus brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus), some years past their initial episode of crime in the name of the Church in Boston, are living a quiet life in Ireland with their father (Billy Connolly), but when they learn their beloved priest has been killed by mob forces, the duo return to Boston to bring justice to those responsible. They take on an assistant - Mexican fighter Clifton Collins, Jr. - and plan the destruction of the killers of the priest.  Naturally there are cops who were in one the original assassinations and they fear for their MacManus friends, but the FBI Special Agent Eunice (Julie Benz, sporting a maladaptive Southern drawl) enters and takes over and the rest is history - and blood, and murders, and caricatures of crime bosses, and noise, and CGI effects.  There are a number of actors with bit parts - Willem Dafoe, Judd Nelson, Peter Fonda - that add little to the big pie. One of the advantages of the DVD is the option to turn on subtitles: otherwise the dialogue is fairly indecipherable under the noise and the 'music score' by Jeff Danna. There must bean audience out there for this kind of movie - otherwise a sequel would never have been made 10 years from the original!

1290102,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B002UNMW7O,Haunted Flower,"[13, 20]","In honor of St. Patrick's Day yesterday, I decided to finally view this movie to find out if it had much in common with its successful cult classic predecessor. This movie made me almost forget everything I enjoyed about the original. If you are an incredibly devoted Boondock Saints fan, you'll probably love this movie because of all the throwback themes of the brothers screwing up on the way to their missions and the willingness of bad guys to stay kneeling in one spot while they are prayed at before being executed.For the more casual observer, this is one of the most ridiculous over-the-top B movies I've seen in a long time. So much that I had to look up and confirm that yes, this movie was also written and directed by Troy Duffy, the same man who did the first one.  Only 8 years have passed in movie time, but 10 years have passed in real life. Connor and Murphy are still played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, but they look much older now! The stuff they got away with looking like kids just doesn't play as well now that they are in their 40s! There's just no hiding how weathered they look. When you're making big mistakes at their age, they just look incompetent and it isn't as much fun when it feels so sad.Unique and honest moments in the first film that became quotable and memorable as a result did not happen here. So much felt forced, profanity for profanity's sake led to a trio of cops sounding more like the Three Stooges than law enforcement. They added a Mexican to their team complete with lots of stereotyping and his eyes bug out of his head so badly, I guess he must be the comic relief. But to what? The whole thing feels like a comedy, the drama almost never gets over.Let's start with the beginning. The brothers are shepherding on a sheep farm in Ireland with their father and have grown almost Moses-like hair in matching brown.  Wow. After a copycat kills a priest in the same style the Saints did, they feel the need to go to America to confront them. This results in a lot of dead people.Willem DaFoe's successor is FBI Special Agent Eunice Bloom played by Julie Benz whom you might remember as Darla from the Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel TV Series. A lot has changed in her appearance but she shows up with a saucy Southern accent to prove how dumb (as if we needed the help, they can barely form sentences) the Three Stooges of law enforcement are by explaining the crime scenes as DaFoe once did. She lacks his charm and charisma and comes off as you-can't-touch-me diva with an attitude so hard-as-nails that you never really warm to her character. Her accent does not make her seem more intelligent, just saucy. But I'm sure guys will warm to something else about her like the long legs and insane heels made for street walking.The movie gets a little better when their father joins in played by Billy Connolly shows up to be dramatic with an old foe. The flashbacks of his youth don't add very much to the story and when you find out the big reason behind all this blood and violence, you'll probably feel pretty annoyed as I was.The action feels similar, that whole disorganized randomness that results in precision headshots and criminals willing to hold still and wait for their death.Overall, this movie feels very disappointing and takes away from the greatness of the original by association.

It was apparently made for 12-year-old boys by 10-year-old boys (dumb ones, no less). Why some folks think it is a ""classic"" is beyond me unless they mean it is a classic of rotten movie-making. In that case I wholeheartedly agreed. It is amateurish except for a few minutes of fair acting. I see no reason why this trashy sequel was made. However, at least they were consistent with the quality of the first. I can say that the first Boondock Saints was fun for me in a perverse way. I like bad movies. However, the sequel to a bad movie that is as pathetic as its original is pointless.: There is no surprise or delight left. It is just the same junk continued for no reason. Perhaps the director thought he was redeeming himself for the first movie. Maybe he believed he had actually improved or learned something or had new ideas? Nope. It is just like watching terrible movie twice. I don't get it. Then, again, I am not a 10-year-old boy who is impressed by blood, cursing or ""cool"" stuff like that. I think it was just made to squeeze another nickel from those poor souls who think the first ""movie"" was art.Note: I was curious and looked up both these clunkers on [...] who puts the sequel in his ""Your Movie Sucks"" file...LOL...and [...] where only 20% of the hundreds of critics who reviewed these movies said they sorta of liked either movie.

I've seen the first one probably 100 times, own 2 DVD copies of it, 1 Blu Ray copy of it, and can pretty much recite every line of the movie given the opportunity.  I'm not saying that to say I have a bias but rather because Saints II manages to get a weird backlash from the first film's fans and I don't think it's warranted.Saints II is definitely not like the first one.  But it's also not so far off from the first one that it shouldn't be sharing its name.  It came 10 years after the first film debuted and I believe that it does a great job of finding the ""sweet spot"" between what needs to be in a sequel and what can make it its own story.  It also does something you don't see in many sequels, especially ones appearing a decade later: it welcomes back the main cast.It has also caught flack for being ""racist"", ""anti-gay"", and a whole host of misnomers.  This is the way the east coast is.  I don't think it even crossed anyone from the coast's mind.All in all, this is a great followup to the first one.

So is it as good as the first one? Yes. I will elaborate on the things that stood out for me. First, it is lower budget than the original. This is noticable immediately by the way the cinematography looks like a made for T.V. film. It's good cinematography mind you, beautiful shots, amazing direction, but you can just tell it's a cheap camera or something by the way it looks when the camera moves. It doesn't look like you're seeing a change of scenery, it looks like a camera pan on the set of a TV soap opera. This isn't as apparent as the action picks up, but right away you can tell it's low budget, and that's saying a lot compared to the first one. Other than that, everything lives up to the original, or surpasses it. It looks like all of the actors are having a lot of fun making the film, as you get a genuine sense that they are enjoying themselves every second of the movie. It's funny, it's action packed, and it's a great continuation of the original. If you didn't get a chance to see it in theaters definitely get this as soon as it comes out. I was lucky enough to see it in theaters, and I will be pre-ordering it as I can not wait to see it again. GREAT MOVIE.

IT came out in theatres and i was not able to make the cut to see it in theatres unfortunately so I waited to see it on DVD/Blu-Ray. I read the reviews and talked to people that saw it and loved the first.. they hated it, said it did the first injustice, dont waste your time.. so I didnt... then I finally told myself that im going to just watch it and judge for myself. So I did and what I saw was an amazing film with an amazing story. does Eunice Bloom try to be Paul Smecker? to an extent yes.. they did try to have a quarky FBI agent to take his role, it can get a little cheezy sometimes with the way she says things and acts on the case, but understand she is Paul Smeckers hand picked replacement, so yeah she would need to be a little like him to be chosen by him.. understand? the boys have witty one liners throughout the movie that made me laugh my arse off the entire time. Romeo I think is a solid replacement for Rocco. I didnt like Rocco al lthat much in the first and I think Romeo does a solid job, as he is a tough La Razza kinda guy who doesnt take any crap, fits alot better than Rocco ever did (in my opinion). the bad guys in this film is where this film lacks the most, Yakavettas ""new crime syndacite is weak at best and lack all the things to make them a good enemy to the Saints, they seem like push overs and characters taht you really dont care if they live or die. its when Il Duce ( the borthers father) story folds out when the main antagonist is revealed when i started to think... hey, now I like this story, and was attentive to the screen to see how it all played out, and it played out just fine, great ending and a FANTASTIC cliffhanger, almost better than the ending to the first.

After a 10-year hiatus from filmmaking, and with the mortgage on his house due, Troy Duffy turned to art to exploit his only cinematic achievement for money. Way too long of a runtime for a flick like this, the borderline ridiculous film sucks up tons of time doing flashbacks and random scenes with a character from the first film Rocco. Not to mention the use of a quirky confusing character to replace him. The film is really so much of a mess you might possibly even know less about the Saints after watching it.

1290122,A3DQDILRL74K37,B002UNMW7O,"KMG ""Apparently I'm a Shopaholic""","[0, 0]","Boondock Saints was my All Time favorite movie for about 5 years.  It is STILL in my Top Five Movies of ALL TIME.  I loved everything about Boondock I and was expecting atleast SOMETHING close with Boondock II.I got a mockery.There was less action, less dark humor, less plot, less acting, and far less directing.  I don't know if they were pressed for time, or pressed for money, or just bad direction... but it was bad.In the first 15 minutes, I'm trying to decide if the 3 goon cops (from Boondock I, but who cared about them?) are the main characters, or if the Brothers are.  Because from what I remember from Boondock I, the Brothers were guys who got sick and tired of the Irish and Italian mobs and they took matters into their own hands.  In Boondock I, the movie was dark and mysterious and downright SEXY (with small bouts of darkly funny humor like the exploding cat scene).  In the 1st, the Brothers had an agenda: To right wrongs.  In 2nd, the Brothers were only trying to clear their name.  But they were acting as if they had been hired assassins for YEARS, when in actuality, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing in BDS 1.This one, we've got the lighting that resemebles the 90s cult movie Clerks.  We've got scenes that are a mockery of Kill Bill moments.  We've got a terrible soundtrack with cheesy background songs.  (They're picking out guns and a crappy love song comes on?  I know you are supposed to treat your guns like ""ladies"" but c'mon.  This movie needed PUMP)  We've got a lady overacting (that Southern accent was laid on way too thick).  We've even got some guy shitting his pants. (is that really necessary?) We've got way too many one-liners, a ""funny guy"" who ain't funny (the cop guys, I liked Romeo), way too many words (way over-scripted), and just too much ""trying to be cool"" instead of just ""being cool.""As far as the actual killer in the beginning who is mimicing the Brothers, I noticed in the first five minutes that he was wearing lifts in his shoes to make him taller.  Then, the cop pointed out the he was wearing lifts when she redesigned the crime scene.  Then, the director showed a shot of the shoes which had a picture with lifts.  Then, the killer had to put on one shoe and they made a big production out of showing us that he was about 2 inches taller when wearing the shoes.  I'm smart.  I don't need you to point out every single thing.  In the end, it didn't even matter that he wanted to be taller.  LAME.The female cop was obviously a fill-in for the gay cop from the first movie.  There was no change there, except the female in this one was played up way too much to be some kind of sex symbol.  They even had slow motion scenes.  If she was a real detective, she would not be wearing 4"" heels.  I'm a chick who loves her heels, and I still think it was dumb to play up her part so much.The Brothers were the best.  Norman Reedus has still got it.  They've aged a bit in the last 10 years since BDS, but they were fantastic.  Apart from the obviously scripted bickering in the warehouse, their relationship is still fantastic and it was believable.  I wish the director really focused on them.  And I wish he hadn't made light of their whole agenda to begin with.  It's like they FORGOT that BDS were badass ""normal"" guys who just got tired of the crap that was going on around them.There were inconsistencies.  In BDS, they only performed the cross-aimed back of the head gunshot through the eyes to the mob bosses.  In BDS 2, they performed it to almost anyone.You ever see ""Can't Hardly Wait""?  Well, ""Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" is Seth Green's character.They're indicating a 3rd BDS.  I hope to god they do it.But this time, choose a director who's going to let the Brothers be as awesome as they are.  no spoofing, no copying past plots, no gimmicky one-liners and over-scripted parts.  Just let the Brothers run the show.  Because after all, it is THEIR show.",3,2.5 Stars- I'm on the Fence Between Bad and Mediocre,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,3942,"['Boondock', 'Saints', 'was', 'Time', 'favorite', 'movie', '5', 'years', 'STILL', 'Top', 'Five', 'Movies', 'TIME', 'loved', 'everything', 'Boondock', 'was', 'expecting', 'atleast', 'SOMETHING', 'close', 'Boondock', 'II.I', 'got', 'mockery.There', 'was', 'less', 'action', 'less', 'dark', 'humor', 'less', 'plot', 'less', 'acting', 'far', 'less', 'directing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'pressed', 'time', 'pressed', 'money', 'just', 'bad', 'direction', 'was', 'bad.In', 'first', '15', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'trying', 'decide', '3', 'goon', 'cops', 'Boondock', 'who', 'cared', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'Brothers', 'are', 'what', 'remember', 'Boondock', 'Brothers', 'were', 'guys', 'who', 'got', 'sick', 'tired', 'Irish', 'Italian', 'mobs', 'took', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'Boondock', 'movie', 'was', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'downright', 'SEXY', 'small', 'bouts', 'darkly', 'funny', 'humor', 'exploding', 'cat', 'scene', '1st', 'Brothers', 'had', 'agenda', 'right', 'wrongs', '2nd', 'Brothers', 'were', 'only', 'trying', 'clear', 'name', 'were', 'acting', 'had', 'been', 'hired', 'assassins', 'YEARS', 'when', 'actuality', 'was', 'kind', 'spur-of-the-moment', 'thing', 'BDS', '1.This', 'one', ""'ve"", 'got', 'lighting', '90s', 'cult', 'movie', 'Clerks', ""'ve"", 'got', 'scenes', 'are', 'mockery', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'got', 'terrible', 'soundtrack', 'cheesy', 'background', 'songs', ""'re"", 'picking', 'out', 'guns', 'crappy', 'love', 'song', 'know', 'are', 'supposed', 'treat', 'guns', 'ladies', ""c'mon"", 'movie', 'needed', 'PUMP', ""'ve"", 'got', 'lady', 'overacting', 'Southern', 'accent', 'was', 'laid', 'way', 'too', 'thick', ""'ve"", 'even', 'got', 'guy', 'shitting', 'pants', 'really', 'necessary', ""'ve"", 'got', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'one-liners', 'funny', 'guy', 'who', 'ai', ""n't"", 'funny', 'cop', 'guys', 'liked', 'Romeo', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'words', 'way', 'over-scripted', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'trying', 'be', 'cool', 'instead', 'just', 'being', 'cool', 'As', 'far', 'actual', 'killer', 'beginning', 'who', 'mimicing', 'Brothers', 'noticed', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'was', 'wearing', 'lifts', 'shoes', 'make', 'taller', 'Then', 'cop', 'pointed', 'out', 'was', 'wearing', 'lifts', 'when', 'redesigned', 'crime', 'scene', 'Then', 'director', 'showed', 'shot', 'shoes', 'had', 'picture', 'lifts', 'Then', 'killer', 'had', 'put', 'one', 'shoe', 'made', 'big', 'production', 'showing', 'was', 'about', '2', 'inches', 'taller', 'when', 'wearing', 'shoes', ""'m"", 'smart', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'point', 'out', 'single', 'thing', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'matter', 'wanted', 'be', 'taller', 'LAME.The', 'female', 'cop', 'was', 'obviously', 'fill-in', 'gay', 'cop', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'change', 'there', 'female', 'one', 'was', 'played', 'up', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'kind', 'sex', 'symbol', 'even', 'had', 'slow', 'motion', 'scenes', 'was', 'real', 'detective', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'wearing', '4', 'heels', ""'m"", 'chick', 'who', 'heels', 'still', 'think', 'was', 'dumb', 'play', 'up', 'part', 'much.The', 'Brothers', 'were', 'best', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'still', 'got', ""'ve"", 'aged', 'bit', 'last', '10', 'years', 'BDS', 'were', 'fantastic', 'Apart', 'obviously', 'scripted', 'bickering', 'warehouse', 'relationship', 'still', 'fantastic', 'was', 'believable', 'wish', 'director', 'really', 'focused', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'light', 'whole', 'agenda', 'begin', 'FORGOT', 'BDS', 'were', 'badass', 'normal', 'guys', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'tired', 'crap', 'was', 'going', 'were', 'inconsistencies', 'BDS', 'only', 'performed', 'cross-aimed', 'back', 'head', 'gunshot', 'eyes', 'mob', 'bosses', 'BDS', '2', 'performed', 'almost', 'anyone.You', 'ever', 'see', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'Well', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'II', 'Saints', 'Day', 'Seth', 'Green', 'character.They', ""'re"", 'indicating', '3rd', 'BDS', 'hope', 'god', 'do', 'it.But', 'time', 'choose', 'director', 'who', 'going', 'let', 'Brothers', 'be', 'as', 'awesome', 'are', 'spoofing', 'copying', 'plots', 'gimmicky', 'one-liners', 'over-scripted', 'parts', 'Just', 'let', 'Brothers', 'run', 'show', 'THEIR', 'show']",The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day

And when it was finally released in theaters, a chorus of mixed reviews rang out.But to be honest, I didn't hate it.The Saints are back, (Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery), lured out of their hiding place in Ireland by a copycat killer.  Julie Benz (from the Showtime hit ""Dexter"") is the new Agent Smecker, if you will, and I found her quite expendable.  Her character was helpful to the boys in the same way that Smecker was but not to the same passionate level.  If she wasn't in the movie, it wouldn't have been such a horrible thing.  No offense to Ms. Benz, since I think she did a great job with the role she was given, but the role could have been left on the cutting room floor and we would have been none the wiser, especially since we had the trio of detectives from the last film, (yes, including Greenley), to help the Saints get their revenge under the legal radar.Romeo (Clifton Collins, Jr.) is the newest addition to the entourage and he is enjoyable, although at times he tries to be laugh-out-loud funny and I just wasn't feeling it.  But he brought a new spin to the Rocco-type vibe we had in the first film.  David Della Rocco even makes a few cameo appearances as the spirit of Rocco, letting the boys know that he is still with them in spirit.Billy Connolly returns as well for the sequel and this film delves into a deeper back story on him, explaining why he was in jail in the first place and how he is connected to everything.  This film feels more like a prequel of questions answered that we might not have needed answered in the first place.  Some things are better left un-overexplained.All in all, the humor is still there and there are a few action-packed scenes that support the kick-assness of the first film.  But it was definitely a bit lackluster.  Judd Nelson as the new villain, (i.e. Yakavetta's son), was kind of a snooze fest, at times almost even painful to watch.  And there are a few surprises in this one that die-hard fans might have a problem with.If you were a fan of the first film, you should definitely check out this film, at least for the fact that director Troy Duffy didn't get overly cocky with the sequel, as some were expecting--he kept the material mainly to what the fans were saying they wanted.

Of course the returning crew of police detectives from Boondock I (who have since sainted the MacManus brothers for doing what they only dream of doing...rid society of scum) don't believe they are responsible and have the pretty, big belt wearing FBI Agent Eunice Bloom (from Buffy, Angel and Dexter) who agrees. They realize that someone wants the brothers to come out of hiding. The Yakavetta Family Mob Boss (played by Judd Nelson) only knows that he wants revenge for his father's death, and the death of the Saint's is the only answer. Meanwhile, we find out how and why the Elder MacManus became a killer (ironically it was the death of his father by mobsters). There is also his eventual capture and incarceration as a result of his brandishing his own sense of justice. As the person at the center of this charade is unveiled, you will marvel at the quick and easy pace of the movie.Now while I loved part 1, there were times in part 2 that I thought they tried way too hard. The easy flow of humor from Boondock 1, at times seemed forced in 2. I also don't think that Bloom was half as good as Dafoe's Smecker. But all in all I was satisfied with the final product, and I am sure that we will see the Saints again, I just hope Duffy goes back to some of the magic he created in Part 1.

A cult film and an underground favorite for all the right reasons.What I was hoping for was more of what I typed up top. What I, and fans of the original got instead, is a mish-mash of poor acting, watered-down chemistry, a bad script, an uneven pace of the film and a general lack of direction. It was as if all the returning actors thought they could just sleepwalk their way through this movie and the new additions thought they could try and fit in as replacements for two outstanding characters from the original. It was all disjointed and any momentum the movie seemed to pick up was killed by Detectives Greenly, Duffy and Dolly and their poor attempts at trying to be funny cops. The ending with Billy Connolly and Peter Fonda is exceptional but not enough to save a film from taking itself too serious.If there is to be a third film, and the ending leaves the door open for that possibility, I hope all involved watch both movies and find out where they went wrong with this sequel.How Troy Duffy got away with this one confuses me.

People are saying that ""It wasn't like the first one"" or ""It's ten years too late"". I'm a fan of the first movie and I enjoyed this one immensely. Of course it isn't like the first one, but 10 years too late? Not to me. Duffy gave himself a decade to make a followup to the cult phenomenon and, well, 10 years later, he gave is possibly the greatest sequel to the first movie one could ask for.Returning to the roles of the insanely badass McManus brothers are Sean Flanery and Norman Reedus, and boy, do they do great here. Also, in place of the lovable Paul Smecker is Julie Benz as Eunice Bloom, a sexy, funny, and smart FBI agent, who, in her words, is ""so f--kin' smart, she makes other smart people feel like they're retarded"" (she stays true to her word!). And also, Billy Connolly as the daddy, Il Duce. But, in place of David Della Rocco is Clifton Collins Jr. as Romeo, a HILARIOUS Mexican dude, whom, believe it or not, tops Rocco by a thousand! And believe me, the cast here is SPECTACULAR! Not a single disappointment.It is 8 years later. The McManuses are living a quiet life on a farm in Ireland, and the brothers (albeit with hilarious long hair and beards). One night at dinner, a priest comes in and gives them the news: They're in trouble. A Boston priest has just been killed, and the killer had done all he can to make it look like the McManuses are responsible. Upon hearing of this, it's time to shave the beards and cut the hair, and jump on the boat back to Boston. On the boat, they meet Romeo, a hilarious and quirky Mexican dude who is interested in joining them. After a rough patch, he joins them, and the minute they are off the boat, they are a team of three. Their goal is not only to get their names cleared, but to get their revenge on the person who killed the priest.However, while that is happening, Paul Smecker is gone and has been replaced by Eunice Bloom, a sexy, funny, and undoubtedly quirky FBI agent. Upon her investigation at the crime scene, she comes to the conclusion that the saints did not kill the priest. It was done by a member of the Yakavetta family, who also wants revenge: On the saints, for killing Pappa Joe. However, despite the cops' and Bloom's positions, they decide that they are just as in it to investigate the murder as The Saints, and worlds collide, with more chaos and action you can handle!I won't give away more, because this movie is simply a must see. Basically, if you liked the first movie, you will like this one a great deal. It has the original brothers, who give great performances, it has tons of action, lots of blood, and is a great time at the cinema for sure. The movie is well paced and well filmed. It is easier to tell that it was shot on a higher budget than the original, which is a good thing, you can see it in the cinematography, you can see it in the effects and everything.

Zwick,"[0, 0]","In ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day,"" the sequel to the original ""Boondock Saints"" from 2000, Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus play two scripture-spouting vigilantes in Ireland who return to the states - where they have achieved near-folk hero status - after a priest friend of theirs is murdered to make them look like the killers (the shots to the back of the head and the pennies left on the eyelids being the hallmark of the boys' work).  You see, eight years back, the boys took out a number of Boston mobsters and now the latter are trying to smoke the killers out to get their revenge.  The brothers are joined in their endeavors by a dimwitted, lachrymose sidekick named Romeo (Clifton Collins Jr.), whom they meet on their trans-Atlantic voyage, while an icy-cool FBI agent (delightfully played by Julie Benz) and a bevy of bumbling, corrupt law enforcement officials work on solving the case.This odd little mixture of smart-alecky humor, stylized, cartoonish violence, and crime movie melodrama is often more ""clever"" than it is funny, with its concepts and intentions often out-performing its execution, coming dangerously close at times to being Tarantino-Lite.  Still, there's enough style in writer/director Troy Duffy's hurdy-gurdy, postmodern spin on the genre to make the movie eminently entertaining and watchable.  And the arch performances delivered by a large and gifted cast - including Billy Connolly and Peter Fonda as two-long term enemies and rivals - add to the spirit of fun.It doesn't really amount to a whole lot in the long run, and it's never quite as fun as it thinks it's being, but ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" does have its entertaining  moments.",3,"Entertaining, if a bit too derivative of Tarantino",1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,1708,"['Boondock', 'Saints', 'II', 'Saints', 'Day', 'sequel', 'original', 'Boondock', 'Saints', '2000', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'play', 'two', 'scripture-spouting', 'vigilantes', 'Ireland', 'who', 'return', 'states', 'where', 'have', 'achieved', 'near-folk', 'hero', 'status', 'priest', 'friend', 'theirs', 'murdered', 'make', 'look', 'killers', 'shots', 'back', 'head', 'pennies', 'left', 'eyelids', 'being', 'hallmark', 'boys', 'work', 'see', 'eight', 'years', 'back', 'boys', 'took', 'out', 'number', 'Boston', 'mobsters', 'now', 'latter', 'are', 'trying', 'smoke', 'killers', 'out', 'get', 'revenge', 'brothers', 'are', 'joined', 'endeavors', 'dimwitted', 'lachrymose', 'sidekick', 'named', 'Romeo', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'whom', 'meet', 'trans-Atlantic', 'voyage', 'icy-cool', 'FBI', 'agent', 'delightfully', 'played', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'bevy', 'bumbling', 'corrupt', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officials', 'work', 'solving', 'case.This', 'odd', 'little', 'mixture', 'smart-alecky', 'humor', 'stylized', 'cartoonish', 'violence', 'crime', 'movie', 'melodrama', 'often', 'more', 'clever', 'funny', 'concepts', 'intentions', 'often', 'out-performing', 'execution', 'coming', 'dangerously', 'close', 'times', 'being', 'Tarantino-Lite', 'Still', 'enough', 'style', 'writer/director', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'hurdy-gurdy', 'postmodern', 'spin', 'genre', 'make', 'movie', 'eminently', 'entertaining', 'watchable', 'arch', 'performances', 'delivered', 'large', 'gifted', 'cast', 'including', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'two-long', 'term', 'enemies', 'rivals', 'add', 'spirit', 'fun.It', ""n't"", 'really', 'amount', 'whole', 'lot', 'long', 'run', 'never', 'quite', 'as', 'fun', 'being', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'II', 'Saints', 'Day', 'have', 'entertaining', 'moments']",The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day

That was Saints part 1.And then down the road have you ever been with the same friends goofing off again, and one guy remembers how funny and awesome that first thing was and tries WAAAY too hard to do something just as spontaneous and over the top so he will have a new story to tell?  But because he was trying it wasnt spontaneous, and because it wasnt spontaneous it wasnt ""funny over the top"" it was just plain ""way too much over the top"" and everybody looked at him like he was just dense or something?  Thats Saints part 2.The first one was a true example of real movie magic, where everything just worked.  It showed real art from the actors, director, and producer.  The second one tried way to hard to be just like the first one.  So much so that alot of the first part of the movie actually felt like a parody of the first one.  The second half of the movie (after they got past making ""lets make fun of Saints 1"" jokes) was actually pretty good.  It got a bit more serious and actually told some interesting story points.In all fairness I will say it really felt like the director felt the immense pressure to live up to the first one.  And in trying to stay close to the winning formula of the first ended up forcing things to fix the pattern.  I dont mean to trash talk this movie, but I will say that the first half of the movie was nearly painful to watch, and the second half I enjoyed.

I guess I see where they're coming from now. It definitely doesn't have the same feel as the first movie. It feels a little scripted, a little forced, a little cheesy, the music doesn't fit, the female FBI agent is fairly annoying... That being said, you may ask 'Why 5 stars?'. Well, I really wanted to love it but, the first third of the movie, I really wasn't feeling it. It was like a bad B-movie and not in a good, cult classic kind of way. The second third of the movie hit its stride and really got me laughing! The drinking scene with F*** A** (Can't swear in the reviews, even though it's kinda the guys name...) is hilarious! ""Shut up! Romeo's cryin'."" gets me every time! And when Greenly listened to 'Sister Christian', I almost peed myself laughing! Then, the final third, a main character dies and the boys have a dream about Rocco and I cried... Hard... Then, another character dies and I cried all the way through until the end. So, yes, the movie tries a little too hard to recapture the feel of the first movie and draws painfully obvious parallels (-Yakavetta Jr. incorrectly pronouncing words like Dolly.-Pretending to shoot Romeo like they did with Rocco in the Russians hotel room.-Fighting in the crate like they did in the ducts.-Greenly and his breath spray.-Bloom's earplugs like Smecker's music.-The whole rope situation...) but, if you can just let go of your expectations and watch the movie for what it is (Everyone from the first movie getting together 10 years later to reminisce, have fun and make a cheesy sequel.) you should enjoy it.

The story contains plenty of guns, slow-mo action, graceful footage of a beautiful Fed, and redemption. The BD preserves the picture and DTS sound perfectly. The clarity is solid throughout and the channels are given plenty of usage from beginning to end. The supplements are outstanding and include:* Deleted scenes. Very short and only last a couple minutes. Would have been nice to see Benz' emotions in the film for the character that gets killed but oh well.* Behind the scenes, 25:40 minutes.

Always plenty of F bombs to keep the entertainment up.* Connelly/Duffy sit down, 9:15 minutes.

So the Brothers return to Boston to exact revenge on who is framing them with the help of Romeo (Clifton Collins Jr--- who provides most of the comedy). And Stepping in the shoes of FBI Agent Smecker (Willem Defoe) is his protege Eunice Bloom whom she learned everything from her mentor (played by Julie Benz who is sexy, and smart in fact very smart, that she makes smart people feel like retards) And have to mention she looks very good in one sequence in a sort of cowboy outfit, complete with cowboy hat and all... very provocative. Expect some returning characters from the original... the 3 cops, the gun runner/seller, the bar keeper with turrets, their fatheer Il Duce (Billy Connolly) and a fan favorite.. Rocko ""I killed your cat you druggie b***!"" Still my favorite line from The Boondock SaintsAnyways...This was a fun movie, nice gun play, comedy, kick ass soundtrack, Troy Duffy does not disappoint the fans, he has delivered in Spades, and the ending is very cool, a special cameo by someone that you would not expect! And the ending hints toward, of course wait for it... Boondock Saints III Pray to the Rosary (that's what I would title it haha)One can tell Duffy had a slightly bigger budget than he did with the original, cool visuals, good shootouts, the interaction between Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery didn't lose a beat after a 10 year hiatus, showing camaraderie as the brothers Macmanus with the joking, cussing and in fighting one can expect from brotherly love, its shows through their performances as our favorite pair of anti heroes.Better than I have expected, good old fashion entertainment undeniably worth checking out if you are a Boondock Saints fan!",4,Aequitas Veritas,1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,2097,"['had', 'misgivings', 'ever', 'heard', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'was', 'planning', 'sequel', '1999', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'there', 'not', 'disappoint', 'follow', 'MacManus', 'Brothers', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'hiding', 'Ireland', 'when', 'are', 'drawn', 'back', 'game', 'when', 'are', 'supposedly', 'connected', 'hit', 'priest', 'back', 'Boston', 'Brothers', 'return', 'Boston', 'exact', 'revenge', 'who', 'framing', 'help', 'Romeo', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr', 'who', 'most', 'comedy', 'Stepping', 'shoes', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Smecker', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'protege', 'Eunice', 'Bloom', 'whom', 'learned', 'everything', 'mentor', 'played', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'who', 'sexy', 'smart', 'fact', 'very', 'smart', 'smart', 'people', 'feel', 'retards', 'have', 'mention', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'sequence', 'sort', 'cowboy', 'outfit', 'complete', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'very', 'provocative', 'Expect', 'returning', 'characters', 'original', '3', 'cops', 'gun', 'runner/seller', 'bar', 'keeper', 'turrets', 'fatheer', 'Il', 'Duce', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'fan', 'favorite..', 'Rocko', 'killed', 'cat', 'druggie', 'b***', 'Still', 'favorite', 'line', 'Boondock', 'SaintsAnyways', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', 'nice', 'gun', 'play', 'comedy', 'kick', 'ass', 'soundtrack', 'Troy', 'Duffy', 'not', 'disappoint', 'fans', 'delivered', 'Spades', 'ending', 'very', 'cool', 'special', 'cameo', 'someone', 'would', 'not', 'expect', 'ending', 'hints', 'course', 'wait', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'III', 'Pray', 'Rosary', 'what', 'would', 'title', 'One', 'can', 'tell', 'Duffy', 'had', 'slightly', 'bigger', 'budget', 'did', 'original', 'cool', 'visuals', 'good', 'shootouts', 'interaction', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'did', ""n't"", 'lose', 'beat', '10', 'year', 'hiatus', 'showing', 'camaraderie', 'brothers', 'Macmanus', 'joking', 'cussing', 'fighting', 'one', 'can', 'expect', 'brotherly', 'love', 'shows', 'performances', 'favorite', 'pair', 'anti', 'heroes.Better', 'have', 'expected', 'good', 'old', 'fashion', 'entertainment', 'undeniably', 'checking', 'out', 'are', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'fan']",The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day
