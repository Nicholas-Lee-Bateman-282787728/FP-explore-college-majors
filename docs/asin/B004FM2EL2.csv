1405107,ALBYN6ZDZCXZ5,B004FM2EL2,Dr Mike C,"[37, 56]","I believe that the length of the original British program is about five hours.  PBS (as usual) edited the film to fit into the length of the Masterpiece program (about 4 hours of actual film).  The specifications of the DVD that are listed above state that the DVD is four hours.  If this is true, PBS is releasing the shortened (edited) version on the DVD.  PBS did this with the early Inspector Lewis DVDs (the Pilot and Series 1&2), and everyone complained.  It appears that PBS is doing this again.After the complaints about (and lack of interest in) the early Inspector Lewis DVDs, I think that PBS relented and released the full videos with the Series 3 Inspector Lewis DVD.  If PBS is doing this again, it upsets me.What PBS chooses to air is its business.  I don't have to watch it, and I don't have to support PBS.  I really resent it, however, when PBS prevents me from purchasing the complete program.  I wish that British producers would not grant PBS the right to issue the American DVDs, and grant that right to Acorn or Koch instead.I hope that I am wrong about this.  If I am, I am sorry for the misinformation.The following is from Wikipedia.  I mention it because it shows that if the public complains about the the time edits, PBS can be convinced to change its mind on this issue:""PBS owns the exclusive rights to both broadcast Lewis and to manufacture DVDs for North America. This is in contrast to Inspector Morse, which was commissioned by British company Carlton Television (originally Central Independent Television) and which included all original broadcast footage, even if that footage was edited on North American TV stations. PBS edits 10 minutes out of every Lewis episode so that it fits into the 90 minute Masterpiece Mystery time slot; this includes a preview of the episode's contents narrated by Alan Cumming before the episode and commercials for other PBS programs at the end of this slot. Even Barrington Pheloung's end credit music is abruptly cut for this purpose. For the Pilot, Inspector Lewis 1, and Inspector Lewis 2 DVD sets, PBS Home Video releases what was broadcast on-air in the US as opposed to the UK DVD content. However, for the new Inspector Lewis 3 DVD set, PBS Home Video has released the unedited UK version of the programs contained in the set.""",1,Length of DVD (lost hour?),1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,2305,"['believe', 'length', 'original', 'British', 'program', 'five', 'hours', 'PBS', 'usual', 'edited', 'film', 'fit', 'length', 'Masterpiece', 'program', '4', 'hours', 'actual', 'film', 'specifications', 'DVD', 'are', 'listed', 'state', 'DVD', 'four', 'hours', 'true', 'PBS', 'releasing', 'shortened', 'edited', 'version', 'DVD', 'PBS', 'did', 'early', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'DVDs', 'Pilot', 'Series', '1', '2', 'everyone', 'complained', 'PBS', 'doing', 'again.After', 'complaints', 'lack', 'interest', 'early', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'DVDs', 'think', 'PBS', 'relented', 'released', 'full', 'videos', 'Series', '3', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'DVD', 'PBS', 'doing', 'again', 'me.What', 'PBS', 'air', 'business', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'support', 'PBS', 'really', 'resent', 'however', 'when', 'PBS', 'purchasing', 'complete', 'program', 'wish', 'British', 'producers', 'would', 'not', 'grant', 'PBS', 'right', 'issue', 'American', 'DVDs', 'grant', 'right', 'Acorn', 'Koch', 'instead.I', 'hope', 'am', 'wrong', 'am', 'am', 'sorry', 'misinformation.The', 'following', 'Wikipedia', 'mention', 'public', 'time', 'PBS', 'can', 'be', 'convinced', 'change', 'mind', 'issue', 'PBS', 'exclusive', 'rights', 'broadcast', 'Lewis', 'manufacture', 'DVDs', 'North', 'America', 'contrast', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'was', 'commissioned', 'British', 'company', 'Carlton', 'Television', 'originally', 'Central', 'Independent', 'Television', 'included', 'original', 'broadcast', 'footage', 'even', 'footage', 'was', 'edited', 'North', 'American', 'TV', 'stations', 'PBS', '10', 'minutes', 'Lewis', 'episode', '90', 'minute', 'Masterpiece', 'Mystery', 'time', 'slot', 'preview', 'episode', 'contents', 'narrated', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'episode', 'commercials', 'other', 'PBS', 'programs', 'end', 'slot', 'Even', 'Barrington', 'Pheloung', 'end', 'credit', 'music', 'abruptly', 'cut', 'purpose', 'Pilot', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', '1', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', '2', 'DVD', 'sets', 'PBS', 'Home', 'Video', 'what', 'was', 'broadcast', 'on-air', 'US', 'opposed', 'UK', 'DVD', 'content', 'However', 'new', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', '3', 'DVD', 'set', 'PBS', 'Home', 'Video', 'released', 'unedited', 'UK', 'version', 'programs', 'contained', 'set']",Masterpiece Classic: Any Human Heart

It's a story that takes the viewer along the different stages of Logan Mountstuart's life.  Mountstuart is a writer with reasonable success until his life was devastated by the loss of his family during WWII. As Mountstuart ages, his life is marked by his association with different women who imparted certain truths that stayed with him.  He only realizes this near the end of his life as he was sorting through his personal effects.What I like about the story is the idea that any person has a story to tell, loves that were lost, dreams that were extinguished.  I suppose that is why the book starts with a quote from Henry James ""Never say you know the last word about any human heart.""The film is beautifully done and I'm impressed with the work that was put into the sets and clothes of the different time periods.  It was also enjoyable to see Mountstuart's encounters with real people like Ernest Hemingway and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor (exceptional performance by Gillian Anderson). Matthew MacFadyen did an excellent job.  His part was the most difficult stage of Mountstuart's life.  The film also has a surreal quality to it, especially when it shows Mountstuart's recurring dream of being a child on a boat and being watched by his different selves at different ages.

1405117,A3TRFOWC4CE8TX,B004FM2EL2,G. Tomer,"[6, 7]","There are so many enjoyable portions of nearly great theatrical aspects in this Masterpiece series. Unfortunately, we are blocked by the primary character from reaching any intended meaning. The central character is completely self-absorbed, and despite great performances by the entire cast, we are frustrated throughout.There remains one exception: the great luminescence (it appeared in various scenes) arrives in conclusion and our aged anti-hero falls; and the show ends. Every idea of concrete reality was tested with the continual affirmation of spirituality. The presence of the luminescence arrives with variations, but the presentation of the child, the youth, and the adult reappear, repeatedly. The old man eventually appears, still there is no timespace context. Therefore, what does any of this [the light & stages of life] mean?Meanwhile, the show continues; and, the central character remains untouched by anyone. Life around applies only to his life: he learns nothing from the birth of his son or the pains of his own father. Adversity slows or stops his pursuits, but nothing penertrates - but, why should it? There's always plenty of s-e-x; otherwise known as life. [in early 20th century, spelling the word was barely acceptable] Worse, our translucent character lives for one thing, his satisfaction and that means gratification with anyone.Not until Hugh Hefner did America consider sex other than essential to reproduction and sinful, otherwise. Meanwhile, guess who moved to the USA? Next, the long forgotten son arrives with his age group and his very mature looking girl friend. Now, was this anything less contrived to other viewers?

She also wrote that the beauty of the story is that ""embitterment never sees its own victories.  Failure, too, has its pleasure.""  A fun comparison yet fine words to describe the ""heart"" of one Logan Mountstuart, a fictional character, whose life in the 20th century is chronicled from his Oxford days in the 1920's to a mere existence in the 1990's.William Boyd, who wrote the novel and the screenplay for this spectacular PBS production, asks and answers this question:  How did a boy adrift on a placid river in Uruguay become a grizzled old man sorting through piles of boxes and books in an old country house in France?  It's a fascinating ride!Sit back and enjoy the clever dialogue, the sets and the photography, the fine performances of Jim Broadbent and Matthew Macfadyen as Mountstuart.Try to keep up with the wives and lovers.  The casting is superb.  Don't overlook the first wife, Lady Lottie Cassell, who gives Logan his love of the aristocratic life and a son.  Hayley Atwell plays Freya, the much loved and beautiful second wife. Kim Cattrall (the sexy vamp from Sex and the City) plays Gloria, a redhaired lover and the third wife of Logan's Oxford buddy. And even after World War II, when Logan leaves a destitute life in London of eating cans of dog food and beans and moves to France, he charms a young neighborhood beauty who has a glorified memory of her father during the war.  (The scenes of an older Mountstuart in military camoflage watching over her father's memorial plaque are hilarious.)Enjoy the real-life 20th century figures who flit in and out of Logan's life. It does not go without saying...as the NYT reviewer suggests...that Logan with his minor literary fame meets Hemingway in Paris.  There are multiple scenes with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.  Wallis Simpson is portrayed by Gillian Anderson (formerly of X-file fame) in glorious witchy mood---she even hisses!  Ian Fleming becomes a suave friend who asks Logan to persuade the Windsor's to move to the Bahamas for national security reasons and encourages Logan to join the Royal Navy.What was so stunning midst Logan's trials and tribulations is the sad fact that he survives a son, a daughter, a wife and two very good friends from his Oxford days. Although he steals Peter's Oxford girlfriend and seduces his third wife, there's a great deal of admiration there:  Peter is a best-selling author of mystery novels.  And to Ben, the other friend, he gives five Joan Miro paintings smuggled out of Spain to start a successful gallery.  And the tender scenes are tender indeed, when he takes in Gloria who is still beautiful but dying of pancreatic cancer. Their scenes eating pate and drinking wine on a disheveled bed are joyously poignant.This is not a tale to remind us ""that success is so often bestowed on those whose personal conduct would seem to warrant it least..."" nor is it a tale of an embittered old man.  It's just an entertaining story of one man's journey through the 20th century.Enjoy!

1405129,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004FM2EL2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Masterpiece Classic has certainly been serving up some sophisticated entertainment of late. This production headlined by an impressive international cast including Jim Broadbent, Matthew Macfadyen, Gillian Anderson, Tom Hollander, Kim Cattrall, Richard Schiff and Hayley Atwell seems, on the surface, to be one of its most promising entries. Following the recollections of author Logan Mountstuart as he tries to assimilate the pieces of his life, this biographical journey traverses approximately six decades with four actors of varying range portraying the novelist. It's an exciting idea and a fascinating trip with tales of success, stories of romance, bits of intrigue, and moments of struggle. This sometimes melancholy look at the vignettes that make up a life story is held together by Broadbent (as the eldest Mountstuart) while sorting through the memorabilia of the passing years.While a child Mountstuart is featured in fantasy sequences, the tale really begins with the college aged version (Sam Claflin). Claflin is an appealing and engaging actor, and the youthful Mountstuart is depicted with energy and much humor. The bulk of the story is handled by the middle aged Mountstuart (MacFadyen)--this includes two marriages, infidelity, children, a foray into espionage, literary success, and waning literary success. And the late-in-life Mountstuart (Broadbent) is left to adapt to the ever changing world. MacFadyen, as I mentioned, carries much of the narrative and Mountstuart rubs elbows with everyone from Hemingway to Ian Fleming to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor (terrifically played by Hollander and Anderson). The film veers from slapstick to maudlin with little warning and its tone tends to be all over the place!In truth, I didn't love ""Any Human Heart"" in the way I expected. I admired its effort, production values, and performances--but the film lacks a bit of heart. Mountstuart is never a particularly likable creation and, at various stages, he is displayed with a chilly emotional detachment. He all but abandons his first wife and child to start a family he dotes on--and never once does the screenplay challenge him to feel regret. Through infidelities, deception, and selfishness, the film never confronts the darker aspects of its own storytelling. I didn't mind the negative qualities that made Mountstuart whole--I just never felt there was a desire to portray him in totality. We're meant to like him at any cost. The end result was that I felt like I never got to know him very well--and since I spent a lifetime with him, that was a bit of an issue for me. Definitely recommended but it is one Masterpiece Classic I probably won't choose to revisit with frequency.

In my local cable outlet, the last episode of Any Human heart was actually broadcast during the Academy Awards. It was no contest; the gross indulgence of the Hollywood moguls paled in comparison. OnlyThe King's Speechlent any credibility to the proceedings.I also want to bring everyone's attention to the utterly glorious soundtrack for this series by the British composer Dan Jones ([...]). This production could have been destroyed by lesser music, but Dan's composition easily transports the viewer/listener into the sublime dimension intended by the writer and director.

So says Logan Mountstuart, who is played by four different actors in ""Any Human Heart."" In the course of four episodes, we find out that Mountstuart--of all people who ever lived--should know firsthand about that.""Any Human Heart,"" in the screenplay by William Boyd based on his novel, takes us through the eighty-five turbulent years of Mountstuart's life, years that just happen to touch on every decade of the 20th Century. From the first scenes of little Logan (Conor Nealon) in a rowboat, we see Logan the Oxford undergraduate (Sam Claflin), Logan the middle-aged novelist, journaiist and art dealer (Matthew Macfadyen), and finally the elderly Logan (Jim Broadbent), sad and alone among boxes of memorabilia in a ramshackle French farmhouse. Logan believes firmly that life is just a matter of luck, and indeed his life is an incredible rollercoaster ride. He goes from a lordly Norfolk estate to solitary confinement in a Swiss prison; from a New York penthouse to a heatless London flat where he is forced to live on dog food. Throughout, Mountstuart has fateful encounters with some of the most glittering celebrities of the century. Some of the encounters are pleasant (Ernest Hemingway,Ian Fleming), others not so much (the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the Baader-Meinhof Gang).Logan bobs through all these adventures, not like a cork that stays the same throughout, but like a glass prism displaying unexpected colors as different angles of light hit it. Logan is not always admirable, but he is always sympathetic. Sometimes we want to punch him for being such an idiot, yet his wit, charm, and essential decency always win us over.Because the story's structure is by nature episodic, a lot of viewers have expressed disappointment in it. For my money, Episode Two is the most enthralling and moving (no fair saying why). Yet the excellence of the writing, production and performances kept me watching gladly throughout all four episodes, and left me hungry for more. Macfadyen and Broadbent are just amazing, but so is everyone else. I was particularly blown away by Gillian Anderson; it took me a while to recognize her as the Duchess of Windsor. Anderson and Tom Hollander, playing the Duke, together create the most letter-perfect, compelling, and loathsome screen portrayals of those fabled royals to date.""Any Human Heart"" may not be a perfect viewing experience, but it is a thrilling and unforgettable one.",5,Logan Mountstuart--A Collection of Selves.,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,2505,"['human', 'being', 'collection', 'selves', 'never', 'stay', 'just', 'one', 'person', 'So', 'Logan', 'Mountstuart', 'who', 'played', 'four', 'different', 'actors', 'Any', 'Human', 'Heart', 'course', 'four', 'episodes', 'find', 'out', 'Mountstuart', 'people', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'should', 'know', 'firsthand', 'Human', 'Heart', 'screenplay', 'William', 'Boyd', 'based', 'novel', 'eighty-five', 'turbulent', 'years', 'Mountstuart', 'life', 'years', 'just', 'happen', 'touch', 'decade', '20th', 'Century', 'first', 'scenes', 'little', 'Logan', 'Conor', 'Nealon', 'rowboat', 'see', 'Logan', 'Oxford', 'undergraduate', 'Sam', 'Claflin', 'Logan', 'middle-aged', 'novelist', 'journaiist', 'art', 'dealer', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'finally', 'elderly', 'Logan', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'sad', 'alone', 'boxes', 'memorabilia', 'ramshackle', 'French', 'farmhouse', 'Logan', 'firmly', 'life', 'just', 'matter', 'luck', 'indeed', 'life', 'incredible', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'lordly', 'Norfolk', 'estate', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'Swiss', 'prison', 'New', 'York', 'penthouse', 'heatless', 'London', 'flat', 'where', 'forced', 'live', 'dog', 'food', 'Throughout', 'Mountstuart', 'fateful', 'encounters', 'most', 'glittering', 'celebrities', 'century', 'encounters', 'are', 'pleasant', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'others', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Duke', 'Duchess', 'Windsor', 'Baader-Meinhof', 'Gang', '.Logan', 'bobs', 'adventures', 'not', 'cork', 'same', 'glass', 'prism', 'displaying', 'unexpected', 'colors', 'different', 'angles', 'light', 'hit', 'Logan', 'not', 'always', 'admirable', 'always', 'sympathetic', 'Sometimes', 'want', 'punch', 'being', 'such', 'idiot', 'yet', 'wit', 'charm', 'essential', 'decency', 'always', 'win', 'story', 'structure', 'nature', 'episodic', 'lot', 'viewers', 'have', 'expressed', 'disappointment', 'money', 'Episode', 'Two', 'most', 'enthralling', 'moving', 'fair', 'saying', 'why', 'excellence', 'writing', 'production', 'performances', 'kept', 'watching', 'gladly', 'four', 'episodes', 'left', 'hungry', 'more', 'Macfadyen', 'Broadbent', 'are', 'just', 'amazing', 'so', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'particularly', 'blown', 'away', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'took', 'while', 'recognize', 'Duchess', 'Windsor', 'Anderson', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'playing', 'Duke', 'together', 'create', 'most', 'letter-perfect', 'compelling', 'loathsome', 'screen', 'portrayals', 'fabled', 'royals', 'date', 'Human', 'Heart', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'viewing', 'experience', 'thrilling', 'unforgettable', 'one']",Masterpiece Classic: Any Human Heart

1405149,A3LBTC13EYE4MS,B004FM2EL2,"Sinohey ""scribe""","[0, 0]","This PBS Masterpiece Theater miniseries from the BBC is an adaptation from William Boyd&#8217;s novel Any Human Heart: The Intimate Journals of Logan Mountstuart. The story of the protagonist&#8217;s entire life, with its ups and downs, triumphs and defeats, successes and failures spans most of the 20th century from 1906 to 1991. It begins with Logan as an octogenarian (Jim Broadbent), in the wake of serious heart attack, trying to sort out his memories from his large collection of dairies, journals, memorabilia and photographs.The theme of the book is that there are many versions of self as we age. The young man is a different person than the adult who changes once more into an old man, distinct and unlike his other personae. In case the viewer does not get the point, a recurring scene of faded images of the three actors who play Logan at various ages staring across a river at a young child (Logan) is repeated more than once in each episode.The story is told in flashbacks exclusively from Logan&#8217;s perspective and is narrated through his journals. As a student at Oxford, in 1920s, Logan&#8217;s main goal is to lose his virginity and to become a writer; in this he competes with his two best lifelong friends, Ben Leeping and Peter Scabius. Early on he succeeds in both quests. He authors a popular book (The Girl Factory), followed by a minor tome (The Occidentals) and achieves modest recognition as a novelist; he is unable to repeat this feat and spends his entire life convinced that he is a writer, but suffers from an unrelenting mental block.Against his father&#8217;s wishes, Logan does not join the family business but instead embarks on an essentially bohemian existence. He (Bruce Macfayden) travels to Paris where he cavorts with Ernest Hemingway and meets an old French poet who greatly appreciates his second book. He is feted in literary circles but cannot sustain his minor celebrity. In the meantime, his friend and nemesis, the treacherous Scabius (Samuel West) produces a series of best-sellers, becomes wealthy and famous.Logan has a series of superficial amorous liaisons and two loveless marriages, the first to Lady Lottie Cassel (Emerald Fennell) with whom he produces a son, which he neglects. And later on, he has a brief marriage with an American socialite who cheats on him.Logan tries his hand at being a war correspondent and is sent to Portugal to cover the civil war in 1930s and meets the love of his life, his soulmate Freya Deverall (Hayley Atwell). When WW ll rumbles on Europe, Logan is recruited by Ian Fleming to become a spy and, later on, liaison with the Windsors, the newly abdicated Edward Vlll and his paramour/wife the divorcee Wallis Simpson. The couple is portrayed as vacuous, opportunistic and corrupt. Gillian Anderson, hams it up as the reptilian Wallis and steals every scene. Tom Hollander personifies the vapid, aristocratically sleazy, pompous yet insignificant Duke, dominated by predatory wife.In middle age, Logan is in New York working at the art galley of his, very successful art dealer, friend Ben Leeping. He begins to drink heavily and is in analysis. His life continues to devolve inexorably until penniless he is reduced to eating canned dog food back in this basement flat in London.No spoilers here, but Gloria Scabius, Peter&#8217;s ex-wife and Logan&#8217;s longtime intermittent lover, returns in his life. Gloria (Kim Cattrall) brings bittersweet moments to his desolation.I have deliberately left out many details to avoid spoiling the complex and rich story of a selfish, self-centered, deluded and embittered man who tries to live by the ever-changing code of his society.

Logan Mountstuart&#8217;s many versions of his life do not make him a likable character but he is interesting to watch in this well crafted miniseries.The casting is spot on; the direction by Michael Samuels, of what must have been a difficult and complicated series of flashbacks to link together in a comprehensive narrative, is professional.

1405156,A107ZX1O8JZCN5,B004FM2EL2,"Vicki Hopkins, Author ""Vicki Hopkins, Author""","[4, 5]","Another night surfing for something to watch brought me to this Masterpiece Classic.  Any Human Heart is based on a novel written by William Boyd, which I have not read.  As far as how close the Masterpiece adaptation is to the written work, I have no idea.It's frankly an emotional journey about one man - Logan Mountstuart from his coming of age to his death.  The movie starts on his pursuit to lose his virginity, along with his college friends that he remains fairly close to throughout life.  Of course, like all young men, virginity is lost, and the boy grows into a man.  Warning: There are some very graphic sexual scenes that may offend.  They are boys in rut.The story follows his pursuit to become a novelist, for which he accomplishes the writing of one book and never seems to come to a place of finishing another.  Life takes him through a loveless marriage, an affair with his one true love, his stint as a British naval intelligence officer during WWII, his rubbing elbows with the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Edward VIII and his wife Wallis Simpson, and finally ending up a recruited, but clueless revolutionary.  Portions of his life are lived in opulent wealth, while toward the end of life he's eating dog food to survive.There are three actors who play Logan from young man to old - Sam Claflin, Matthew Macfadyen, Jim Broadbent.  I enjoyed Matthew fairly well, but I cannot say it was his best performance.  Logan, as a character, is interesting enough. He lives with the philosophy of his father, that life is merely about luck.  It's either good luck or back luck.  There isn't a God.  There's only luck, and you hear that phrase until you're tired of hearing that phrase.  The greatest heartache of his life revolves around his wife, daughter, and unborn child he loses during the war.  It's a loss he never truly recovers from the remainder of his days.Any Human Heart isn't the best of series that I've watched.  It's mildly engaging and a thoughtful look at the meaning of life from birth to death.  By the end you're beginning to weigh the good and bad luck in your own life.  One part of the movie I did enjoy was the multiple times Logan sat down, rolled a piece of paper into the typewriter, and sat there waiting for his next book to come out of him.  He had writer's block that lasted for a lifetime and a blank page that never got filled.",3,Lucky or Unlucky - The Answer to Life's Questions,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,2373,"['night', 'surfing', 'something', 'watch', 'brought', 'Masterpiece', 'Classic', 'Any', 'Human', 'Heart', 'based', 'novel', 'written', 'William', 'Boyd', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'As', 'far', 'how', 'close', 'Masterpiece', 'adaptation', 'written', 'work', 'have', 'idea.It', 'frankly', 'emotional', 'journey', 'one', 'man', 'Logan', 'Mountstuart', 'coming', 'age', 'death', 'movie', 'pursuit', 'lose', 'virginity', 'college', 'friends', 'fairly', 'close', 'life', 'course', 'young', 'men', 'virginity', 'lost', 'boy', 'man', 'Warning', 'are', 'very', 'graphic', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'may', 'offend', 'are', 'boys', 'rut.The', 'story', 'pursuit', 'become', 'novelist', 'writing', 'one', 'book', 'never', 'come', 'place', 'finishing', 'Life', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'affair', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'stint', 'British', 'naval', 'intelligence', 'officer', 'WWII', 'rubbing', 'elbows', 'likes', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'wife', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'finally', 'ending', 'up', 'recruited', 'clueless', 'revolutionary', 'Portions', 'life', 'are', 'lived', 'opulent', 'wealth', 'end', 'life', 'eating', 'dog', 'food', 'survive.There', 'are', 'three', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Logan', 'young', 'man', 'old', 'Sam', 'Claflin', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'enjoyed', 'Matthew', 'fairly', 'well', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'best', 'performance', 'Logan', 'character', 'interesting', 'enough', 'philosophy', 'father', 'life', 'merely', 'luck', 'good', 'luck', 'back', 'luck', ""n't"", 'God', 'only', 'luck', 'hear', 'phrase', ""'re"", 'tired', 'hearing', 'phrase', 'greatest', 'heartache', 'life', 'wife', 'daughter', 'unborn', 'child', 'war', 'loss', 'never', 'truly', 'recovers', 'remainder', 'days.Any', 'Human', 'Heart', ""n't"", 'best', 'series', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'mildly', 'engaging', 'thoughtful', 'look', 'meaning', 'life', 'birth', 'death', 'end', ""'re"", 'beginning', 'weigh', 'good', 'bad', 'luck', 'own', 'life', 'One', 'part', 'movie', 'did', 'enjoy', 'was', 'multiple', 'times', 'Logan', 'sat', 'down', 'rolled', 'piece', 'paper', 'typewriter', 'sat', 'waiting', 'next', 'book', 'come', 'had', 'writer', 'block', 'lasted', 'lifetime', 'blank', 'page', 'never', 'got', 'filled']",Masterpiece Classic: Any Human Heart
