170642,A3R4794K2RVU1S,1415723346,Danny Yu,"[1, 1]","Who knew that Jennifer Love Hewitt could lead a series, and ultimately finish with 5 seasons (should have been one more if it wasn't for CBS not renewing). In the first season, Hewitt, Taylor, Conrad, and company do a tremendous job making each show gripping and enjoyable to watch.Premise: Melinda Gordon (Hewitt) just married Jim Clancy (David Conrad) and she owns an antique shop in Grandview, where they also live. However, she is blessed with an unique gift of being able to speak  to and see ghosts. Despite the danger and occasional tricks that spirits play on her, she understands the spirits and ultimately help them cross over into the light.Some thoughts:*Sometimes it's a peaceful interaction, but many times it's a scary and ominous interaction with the ghosts and spirits. Of all the seasons, the 1st season was one of the more scary and terrifying seasons. I might just be weak and a scaredy-cat, but I found myself hiding under the sheets and grabbing my wife during some of the spooky seasons. The creaking doors, whispering noises, pop-out-of-nowhere to make you jump, mirrors, etc. are among some of the approaches. I think the producers, editors and crew did a good job making each episode a quality and enjoyable experience. Of course, there will be some cheesy scaring tricks as well.** I really like the variety and dynamics of the different characters. The different characters and actors/actresses featured on the show are engaging and relatable. I won't mention any, to spare you some spoiling and fun.*** The core cast of characters do a superb job creating realistic and likeable characters. Andrea (Aisha taylor) is believable as Melinda's store partner and best friend. Jim (David Conrad) comes into his own as the husband of Melinda. He is a strong supporting character that does well in his role, but is refreshing too when he steps out and is the main focus of an episode.**** Stories, plots, and writing are well done. I can always sense some investigation and mystery intertwined with the shows. It's fun to uncover information; it's like I'm right there next to Melinda and co. Good flow of dialogue throughout the show, with some occasional pop culture thrown in.***** I love the build up to the latter half of the show. Once Melinda has reached the point in which the spirit she is helping is about to cross over, it's extremely enjoyable to watch. There is so much emotion, empathy, forgiveness, sometimes you can't help but shed a tear with them.Overall, an excellent show that touches everyone's heart and feelings. Hewitt shines as a lead, as well as the supporting cast. A well done and edited show.

I couldnt help but see some similarities to a horror movie or two that she's done in the past.  In one episode her house starts flipping out and she gets her caught in the garbage disposal (it has to be cut by her husband) happened to Sarah Michelle Gellar in I Know What You Did Last Summer and a couple other slight things that i noticed (reminded of those movies).  Love the fact that she's playing a character like this with a deep and strong devotion to helping those out there with her gift.  She does it well considering most folks dont know about her gift besides the people that she's helped, her husband, her best friend/partner at her antique shop and her mom.The only thing i didnt like was the way it ended for one of the characters in the show...i dont want to give away things for those that havent seen it yet.  But it left me with some questions and hope they get answered in the 2nd season.

I'm not a fan of ghost stories generally and would normally warn those who aren't to shy away from this series. However, if you can get by the ghosts, several of the episodes use the ghost story as a plot device to explore compelling HUMAN stories (somewhat like Hewitt's film ""If Only""). As such, even if you don't like ghosts, read on:The good:In the episodes I've seen at least, the story with the ghosts provided a segway into a far more compelling human drama. For example, in one episode I saw, the ghosts torment a father and daughter who feel guilty over the mother's death. The emotionally compelling part of the episode was seeing the father and daughter deal with their guilt and frustration. Hewitt, as the ghost whisperer, indirectly helps these catharses.Now, the bad:The ghosts aren't subtle. With a few exceptions (generally shadows in a dark room), the ghosts look and act just like normal people, only that ""only"" Hewitt can see them. There's no especially pale skin, glow, or anything else to make the ghosts seem supernatural. Admittedly, this varies by episode, and some ghosts seem to have supernatural powers. Still, don't expect freaky special effects.In short, if you like the type of sitcom/dramas generally shown on the WE channel, you might like Ghost Whisperer. Don't be too turned off by the ghosts in the stories (even if the ghosts can get snarky at times).

Miller ""Gotmywings2001""","[97, 102]","OK, I will admit to watching this for the lovely Jennifer Love Hewitt, having followed her career since Party of Five and several movies of varying quality. And when I first read that she would be returning to television in a series with this story I was, to put it mildly, not encouraged. But I have to admit this is quite a good show. Yes, the concept is similar to NBC's Medium but crossed with CBS' Touched by an Angel. So yes, it's a little corny at times. It's probably aimed at an older demographic being on CBS. But that doesn't detract from it being rather good, in that ""tell me a spooky story"" mode like the old Twilight Zone shows were at times.Jennifer plays Melinda Gordon, recently married, now a small business owner in the town of Grandview (state unknown, but aren't all TV small towns like that?) who has held a particular ability since childhood, the ability to communicate with the dead. She ""sees"" them and is sought out by them to help them make their final journeys into the afterlife. Or ""crossover"" as it's been termed. But before they can, they all have unfinished business with their loved ones. Usually, it's the circumstances behind their deaths that lead them to Melinda. So ""the dead"" range from an M.I.A. soldier wishing to tell his now grown son the details of his disappearance, to a wrongly executed artist, to a 9 year old boy trying to tell his mother his death was not her fault.  Naturally those she encounters are all skeptical, even hostile at times. But even she admits it's not easy having this ability, at times she wishes she didn't have it.With each episode we learn a little more about her and her abilities with the undead. Like the fact her own mother has the same abilities but has tried to suppress them all her life and has had to deal with the guilt that entails. And all this leads up to the first season finale when she must deal with the victims of a plane crash and the multiple ""crossings"" that must occur, and the sudden twist to this story that served as the first season cliffhanger.So far, there's no details on extra features, if any, here. But I would hope we'll get some episode commentaries, particularly from the show's creator as well as Ms. Jennifer. She was featured on the commentary track for her film ""Heartbreakers"" and proved to be a great storyteller on that film. I'm sure she'd be just as informative on this series.As I said, this show is a guilty pleasure for me. Jennifer is beautiful to look at here; she can play strong, yet vulnerable characters.

I was sold on Hewitt as an actress early on in Party of Five, but if there are doubters watch the movie ""If Only""... it's quite enthralling and she's great in that picture.Ok back to Ghost Whisperer...the show has a good mosaic of moods created, so it's not always intense all throughout, but it had me frightened and crying (often) and laughing too.Hewitt is well cast as there is a genuine compassion, which exudes from her character and I like that we don't have to question her relationship with her husband...it's kind of refreshing to see a strong duo that are committed to each other.A couple episodes I absolutely adored...""Lost Boys"", very Charles Dickens and the boy actors in this episode are stellar.""Undead Comic"", if anyone has lost someone or knows someone who has been affected by suicide this episode really tugs at the soul...beautiful, beautiful script.The last three episodes are also very good, and take you in a totally different, darker direction.This is a great show, I can't wait for the next season to come out.... if your not sure about it check-out an episode on TV or rent the DVD's first.It really is the stories of the ghosts that make the most powerful aspect of the show and there's something so intriguing about being able to finish things up or clear things over with loved ones once their gone.  Watching characters have that closure to so much pain is moving yet somehow out of reach from my natural comprehension of reality that I really couldn't help but be envious.  At the same time we shouldn't take for granted the moments we do have with those we love; quite an ageless, universal truth.",4,A great little find!,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,2132,"['Yes', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'show', 'when', 'aired', 'originally', 'yes', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'got', 'chance', 'rent', 'disks', 'out', 'local', 'DVD/Video', 'shop', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'interested', 'there', 'was', 'literally', 'nothing', 'rent', 'so', 'went', 'TV', 'dvd', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'eye', 'candy', 'vs.', 'real', 'actress', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'smart', 'touching', 'show', 'not', 'afraid', 'deal', 'issues', 'such', 'suicide', 'evil', 'loss', 'was', 'sold', 'Hewitt', 'actress', 'early', 'Party', 'Five', 'are', 'doubters', 'watch', 'movie', 'Only', 'quite', 'enthralling', 'great', 'picture.Ok', 'back', 'Ghost', 'Whisperer', 'show', 'good', 'mosaic', 'moods', 'created', 'not', 'always', 'intense', 'had', 'frightened', 'crying', 'often', 'laughing', 'too.Hewitt', 'well', 'cast', 'genuine', 'compassion', 'character', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'question', 'relationship', 'husband', 'kind', 'refreshing', 'see', 'strong', 'duo', 'are', 'committed', 'other.A', 'couple', 'episodes', 'absolutely', 'adored', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'very', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'boy', 'actors', 'episode', 'are', 'stellar', 'Undead', 'Comic', 'anyone', 'lost', 'someone', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'affected', 'suicide', 'episode', 'really', 'soul', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'script.The', 'last', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'take', 'totally', 'different', 'darker', 'direction.This', 'great', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'season', 'come', 'out', 'not', 'sure', 'check-out', 'episode', 'TV', 'rent', 'DVD', 'first.It', 'really', 'stories', 'ghosts', 'make', 'most', 'powerful', 'aspect', 'show', 'something', 'so', 'intriguing', 'being', 'able', 'finish', 'things', 'up', 'clear', 'things', 'loved', 'ones', 'once', 'gone', 'Watching', 'characters', 'have', 'closure', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'moving', 'yet', 'somehow', 'reach', 'natural', 'comprehension', 'reality', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'envious', 'same', 'time', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'granted', 'moments', 'do', 'have', 'love', 'ageless', 'universal', 'truth']",N/A

The cover says: ""SOME MUSIC HAS BEEN CHANGED FOR THIS HOME ENTERTAINMENT VERSION.""  That's putting it mildly. From what I can tell, *all* of the popular songs have been changed to generic Musak.On broadcast episodes of Ghost Whisperer, background music/lyrics are important; sometimes they actually define or even divine the entire episode.  The deletion of ""You Are What You Love"" by Jenny Lewis and the Watson Twins from ""The Vanishing"" is a travesty.  This profound, yet upbeat song is replaced by a slow, awful ballad that gives absolutely no hint to the joy, the highs and lows, and sweetness that's love - and also is Melinda's gift. The song was the episode's ""teaser"" - but it was also so much more than that! It set a tone of hope for ""The Vanishing."" Without ""You Are What You Love"" the episode is oppressive and painful to watch.CBS made a poor choice stripping the broadcast music. I would've gladly paid a little extra to cover licensing fees.As for the DVD set itself? It's okay. There are extras, deleted scenes and commentary tracks.  This is a slim set, too. (Yippee!)

170665,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,1415723346,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[4, 9]","My girlfriend and sister used to get together to watch this show every Friday, but they noticed some problems.  Why must every episode, for instance, break down into emotional hysteria in the final act?  Is it too much to do some location shooting so the show doesn't look so tied to a back lot set?  And how much of Jennifer Love Hewitt's cleavage must they display in every episode?The show plainly aims for a primarily female audience.  Girl-bonding and loving-hubby themes are mainstays of the structure.  But it also tries to drum up suspense and horror.  I won't say the two can't go together, but the pattern is distinctly repetitive.  Nearly every episode begins with Hewitt's character, Melinda Gordon, trembling in fear of some gruesome spirit; nearly every episode ends with Gordon in tears of mourning as she explains to the spirit why crossing over isn't so bad.Perhaps the mainly male production team thinks that teary-eyed protestations of limp theology will reach a girly audience.  And perhaps they're right, since the show has a large loyal following.  But women I trust, like my sister and my girlfriend, assure me that when the show piles on the same structure week after week, it taxes their ability to take the emotions seriously.Though the show aims for a mainly female audience, it never misses a chance to render good-looking women like Jennifer Love Hewitt and Aisha Tyler as eye candy.  I suspect the creative team thinks men will watch more if there's a hint of skin.  And I can't deny that my girlfriend is sick of me hitting the rewind button every time Sigourney Weaver strips to her skivvies in ""Alien.""  But men need that eye candy in a story we can get behind, not one that peters out in favor of a weepy sermon just when things are getting good.This show's spirit world is especially weak tea.  We hear a lot about the light and, in a handful of episodes, about the dark, but they are never defined.  Whenever Melinda Gordon is pressed on this question, she finks.  My suspicion is that the creative team wants to avoid offending any particular religion.  They accomplish this task by addressing none of them.  Considering that this question comes up in nearly every episode, I find a ""ho-hum"" coming on every time we approach the final act.This series is very loosely based on the work of spiritists James Van Praagh and Mary Ann Wintkowski, both of whom are interviewed in the special features of this DVD collection.  Don't watch them.  It's amazing how they can discuss something as potentially mind-blowing as talking with the spirits of the dead, and still come across as uninteresting wet rags.I know many people enjoy this show, and I don't want to take anything from them.  If this is your taste, bless your heart.  But when I deal with such potentially meaty subjects, I don't want my story to wimp in the clutch.  I look forward to a show which addresses questions like these without giving up its teeth.

This is so much better than Medium - I think it has something to do with the younger and more vibrant cast.Melinda Gordon (Love-Hewitt) realises at a young age that she has a gift to talk to those who haven't yet crossed over.  Why haven't they crossed over yet?  They have unfinished business here on earth and it becomes her job to help them.The show really begins with Melinda's wedding to Jim (the gorgeous David Conrad from Miss-Match) and when they move into their new house, she's already confronted by the first ghost that we see.  Each weeks episode features a new ghost who needs her help, and while it may sound corny, it is sometimes moving and sad and sweet all at the same time.It's a good show that may not appeal to everyone, but is definately worth trying to watch (if you are someone who thinks this may not appeal to  you).  I also like Melinda's business partner, Andrea (Aisha Tyler) who tries to understand and help out Melinda with all the ghostly goings on.

170670,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,1415723346,Michael Butts,"[6, 8]","That's right...if you watch the whole first season in succession as I did, you'll probably need a large box of Kleenex, because it's obvious the stories are meant to ventilate the tear ducts.Is GHOST WHISPERER as good as its counterpart, MEDIUM?  I don't think so...MEDIUM uses the dark edge of communicating with the dead and has more involving storylines that don't always revolve around uniting families.  And Patricia Arquette's character seems more plausible than Jennifer Love Hewitt's Melinda Gordon.  But is GHOST WHISPERER entertaining?  Yes, it is, if you accept its redundance and ""family"" oriented themes.Hewitt plays Melinda, a young woman who has the gift of communicating with ghosts, those spirits who are earthbound and haven't ""crossed Over"" because they have unfinished business.  This business is almost always involving a spouse who didn't get to tell their other how much they loved them, or not to blame themselves for the death; or a parent whose child died thinking they didn't really love them.  Hewitt chews up the scenery and is obviously into her role (as a producer, she has more at stake), and she cries really well, and even wears her false eyelashes to bed and after having accidents.  The show glamourizes Hewitt a little too much, and some of the music is obviously aimed at the teen crowd.  There's one episode where a football player died while practicing, and his girlfriend thought he was cheating on her.  Turns out the ""other woman"" was a dance instructor who was teaching the incompetent boy how to dance for the homecoming dance.  When Melinda finally unites them, the couple dance to music that just pops out of nowhere.  That's the gimmick that weakens the story sometimes.But the last two episodes are darker, involving the recurring Man in the Black Cape and Hat storyline, with a great storyline involving an airplane crash and a shocker of a finale that I didn't see coming.David Conrad plays Jim, Melinda's paramedic husband who supports his wife's gift and is loyal and sometimes stiflingly perfect; Aisha Tyler is Melinda's partner/friend Andrea who helps her run her antique store.  Recurring visits from Anne Archer and Christine Baranski as the couple's mothers helps.The show's message seems to be ""Make the most out of your life and always tell the ones you love how you feel.""

And the relationship between Melinda (Hewitt) and and her husband (Conrad) is portrayed as a true partnership.

The primary theme of the show is to get deceased people into the white light. In this way, they can be peaceful and with their loved ones.  Another theme that this show somewhat teaches is non-judgment of others.  For example, when the spirit goes into the white light, the spirit is not judged but accepted and forgiven.  This puts a great message into the world.  One being that we should treat others and ourselves with regard and compassion in the same way.  This is also based on many yoga beliefs that we should replace judgment with compassion. In this way, everyone benefits.  In other words, live with your heart and come from there and all things will be in peace.

170679,A3PWPNZVMNX3PA,1415723346,rareoopdvds,"[0, 0]","Melinda (Hewitt) can see dead people. They either come to her for help or she stumbles upon these people and cant shake them, so is forced to help them. In a small town - a very small town, Melinda owns a quaint antique store, but never works for more than 5 minutes. Eventually she is interrupted by a ghost trying to get her attention where her partner/friend will have to man the store. Ultimately she is a ghost detective on the trail to find out what happened to these dead people.As the show progresses, it appears these ""haunts"" are not always malicious, but misunderstood. Further, it seems she has a good PR in the spirit world as they go straight to her house or place of work. And so, for a very small town, it seems replete with spirits who have yet to ""crossover"". A debate one might have is, what did these ghosts do before Melinda? How come they don't know what to do? Why doesn't another ghost help out a fellow ghost? How come Melinda never can enjoy a night with her friends without something happening? Ok, these are just some questions. Each episode brings its own set of questions along the way.Overall, despite the general debatable storyline, it is fun and Hewitt definitely is a likable personality in the show. While she definitely is pretty, and other other reviews say she is only eye candy, I feel she is generally toned down in the sexual exploitive area. Most of the time she is wearing clothes that cover her up. Its not towards the end of the first season that characters in the storyline hit on her and comment on her looks and you see some more clothes that outline her body.But thats neither here nor there. The story is formulaic which makes it easy to watch after a time. One does not need to see these in complete succession to figure things out, but there are peripheral stuff that happens which comes to the forefront from time to time. But so long as it does not take over Melinda's detective work. Its a fun show that can be compulsive at times, but its still a love it and leave it show.

It wasn't until I watched it on Amazon Prime that I saw it from pilot on through the first season. It put a lot of things in perspective, especially the weekly opening with the dead man in the coffin. I also got an understanding of her relationship with her grandmother, who her mother is, and her assistant who I first noticed when she died prior to watching Season 1 in order on Amazon Prime. I have loved this series since I first watched it in syndication. It has always been well written and well acted. I'm glad it now all ties together in my head (at least Season 1 does).

Unlike the full-blooded horror of ""Supernatural"", ""Ghost Whisperer"" disturbs you in a quiet way. These stories are rooted in deeply human conflicts and are often heart-wrenching. The program's spiritual themes are so uplifting. Highly recommended.

I never missed when it was on Friday nights.  And there wasn't an episode that didn't make me cry at the end.  I was mad when they took the show off the air.I bought season 1 because there are a few episodes that are my absolute favorites!!  Especially, ""The Crossing.""  The little boy in that episode did such a wonderful job, and made his character so believable! All he had to do was pout, and I started tearing up.  I think he should have recieved an emmy for his performance.  But I did read he did get an award for it. Not an emmy, but another type.
