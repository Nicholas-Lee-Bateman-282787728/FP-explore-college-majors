The actress portraying Anne, Natalie Dormer, is phenomenal; not only does she enjoy outstanding chemistry with Jonathan Rhys Meyers (King Henry), but her performance just keeps getting better and better as Anne spirals downward from beloved wife to accused adulterer and traitor!  The finale is a masterpiece on film, as Anne goes bravely to her unjust death on the scaffold.  I read that the entire cast gave her a standing ovation after her last scene was filmed, and I can certainly understand why!  Natalie Dormer's scenes with JRM are outstanding, and so incredibly real - you really feel their passion in all of their scenes, whether it is love or hatred.

171908,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,1415743762,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 0]","England, 1533. King Henry VIII is anxious to formally annul the marriage to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and to wed Anne Boleyn in her stead. However, the Pope remains adamantly opposed to both the union and the king's reforming of the Church in England. As a major schism looms, the king finds himself at odds with some of his most loyal friends and supporters, including Sir Thomas More.The second season of The Tudors covers what is generally considered to be the most pivotal period in the life of King Henry VIII, extending from his marriage to Anne Boleyn to the latter's fall from grace and execution just three years later. This period includes the separation of the Church of England from Rome, the martyrdom of Thomas More, the birth of the future great Queen of England Elizabeth I, and the rise to prominence of Jane Seymour, who is destined to become Henry's third wife. It's a rich period of history, dramatised many times (but arguably most famously in the play and film A Man For All Seasons, which focuses on More). The Tudors, due to its wider scope, has the ability and freedom to take this story and integrate it into a wider dramatisation of Henry VIII's entire reign, which has positive and negative consequences. Negatively, this is arguably the heart of Henry VIII's story and what comes after cannot help but be anticlimactic in comparison (though the producers of the show certainly give it a go). On the plus side the great time afforded the story by a television series means that the show can do some very interesting things, like devoting the entire final episode of the season to the hours leading up to Anne's execution, a move which succeeds splendidly and gives us what may be the best episode of the series.A noticeable gap in the cast is that of Sam Neill, whose character of Cardinal Wolsey died at the end of the first season. The less-well-known James Frain has to step up as his effective replacement, the ruthless reformer Thomas Cromwell, and does an excellent job. The show also brings in the legendary Peter O'Toole as Pope Paul III, mainly to show the reactions to Henry's policies in Rome. This is a bit of an odd move, as this storyline never really goes anywhere. The Pope commands King Francis I of France to invade England, an ominous development which is subsequently ignored, and is later shown having frustrated episodes over the work of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel. Amusing, but it forms a digression that might have been better spent in England fleshing out the existing, more prominent characters. O'Toole is, of course, brilliant, but his presence in this role does feel a little bit of a waste of a major casting coup.Natalie Dormer continues doing excellent work as Anne Boleyn, and has the difficult task of portraying the queen's descent into paranoia as she suffers miscarriages and earns the king's enmity. The show adopts a sympathetic approach to the queen, showing her to be distressed by her inability to bear the king a living son and innocent of the charges brought against her (though heavily indicating that she may have been promiscuous as a youth before meeting the king). Jeremy Northam also does good work as Sir Thomas More, the man of conscience and integrity who tries to balance his belief in his faith with his love for the king and dies for it.In the central role of Henry VIII, Jonathan Rhys Meyers shows early signs of improvement over his inert Season 1 performance. This may be attributable to his decision to 'do a Riker' and grow a beard between seasons. Unfortunately, the beard is rather unimpressive (a quarter-Riker at best) and his performance soon returns to a binary state of either being coldly inscrutable or insanely furious. Scenes which require him to smile or be jovial feel forced and unconvincing, and the less said about the spontaneous way he meets and immediately falls in love with Jane Seymour the better. The whole storyline with Jane Seymour is rather badly handled, with the show deviating even further than it normally does from history (Jane had been at court for a year before Henry and Anne even married) and treating the relationship rather tritely, despite Anita Briem's best efforts with the material.On the plus side, Henry Cavill improves significantly this season as the king's best friend, Charles Brandon. He shows Brandon's growing maturity as he casts aside his philandering ways to concentrate on his family life, in contrast to Henry's constant flitting between mistresses, and also his growing spiritual crisis of faith at the things he has to do in the name of the Reformation. This is a theme that continues into the third season.Overall, the second season of The Tudors (***) is much as the first: it's tosh but watchable tosh which gets a lot of the details of the history wrong but does succeed in nailing the broader picture. However, the second season is elevated over the first by the richer, more dramatic events being depicted and some improvements in both writing and acting.",3,Enjoyable tosh,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,5028,"['England', '1533', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'anxious', 'formally', 'annul', 'marriage', 'first', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'wed', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'stead', 'However', 'Pope', 'adamantly', 'opposed', 'union', 'king', 'reforming', 'Church', 'England', 'major', 'schism', 'king', 'odds', 'most', 'loyal', 'friends', 'supporters', 'including', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'More.The', 'second', 'season', 'Tudors', 'what', 'generally', 'considered', 'be', 'most', 'pivotal', 'period', 'life', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'extending', 'marriage', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'latter', 'fall', 'grace', 'execution', 'just', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'period', 'separation', 'Church', 'England', 'Rome', 'martyrdom', 'Thomas', 'More', 'birth', 'future', 'great', 'Queen', 'England', 'Elizabeth', 'rise', 'prominence', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'who', 'destined', 'become', 'Henry', 'third', 'wife', 'rich', 'period', 'history', 'dramatised', 'many', 'times', 'arguably', 'most', 'famously', 'play', 'film', 'A', 'Man', 'Seasons', 'More', 'Tudors', 'due', 'wider', 'scope', 'ability', 'freedom', 'take', 'story', 'integrate', 'wider', 'dramatisation', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'entire', 'reign', 'positive', 'negative', 'consequences', 'Negatively', 'arguably', 'heart', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'story', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'anticlimactic', 'comparison', 'producers', 'show', 'certainly', 'give', 'go', 'plus', 'side', 'great', 'time', 'afforded', 'story', 'television', 'series', 'show', 'can', 'do', 'very', 'interesting', 'things', 'devoting', 'entire', 'final', 'episode', 'season', 'hours', 'leading', 'up', 'Anne', 'execution', 'move', 'splendidly', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'episode', 'series.A', 'noticeable', 'gap', 'cast', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'character', 'Cardinal', 'Wolsey', 'died', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'less-well-known', 'James', 'Frain', 'step', 'up', 'effective', 'replacement', 'ruthless', 'reformer', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'excellent', 'job', 'show', 'also', 'legendary', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Pope', 'Paul', 'III', 'mainly', 'show', 'reactions', 'Henry', 'policies', 'Rome', 'bit', 'odd', 'move', 'storyline', 'never', 'really', 'anywhere', 'Pope', 'King', 'Francis', 'France', 'invade', 'England', 'ominous', 'development', 'subsequently', 'ignored', 'later', 'shown', 'having', 'frustrated', 'episodes', 'work', 'Michelangelo', 'Sistine', 'Chapel', 'Amusing', 'digression', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'spent', 'England', 'fleshing', 'out', 'existing', 'more', 'prominent', 'characters', ""O'Toole"", 'course', 'brilliant', 'presence', 'role', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'waste', 'major', 'casting', 'coup.Natalie', 'Dormer', 'doing', 'excellent', 'work', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'difficult', 'task', 'portraying', 'queen', 'descent', 'paranoia', 'miscarriages', 'king', 'enmity', 'show', 'sympathetic', 'approach', 'queen', 'showing', 'be', 'distressed', 'inability', 'bear', 'king', 'living', 'son', 'innocent', 'charges', 'brought', 'heavily', 'indicating', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'promiscuous', 'youth', 'meeting', 'king', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'also', 'good', 'work', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'More', 'man', 'conscience', 'integrity', 'who', 'balance', 'belief', 'faith', 'love', 'king', 'dies', 'it.In', 'central', 'role', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'early', 'signs', 'improvement', 'inert', 'Season', '1', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'attributable', 'decision', ""'do"", 'Riker', 'grow', 'beard', 'seasons', 'Unfortunately', 'beard', 'rather', 'unimpressive', 'quarter-Riker', 'best', 'performance', 'soon', 'binary', 'state', 'being', 'coldly', 'inscrutable', 'insanely', 'furious', 'Scenes', 'require', 'smile', 'be', 'jovial', 'feel', 'forced', 'unconvincing', 'less', 'said', 'spontaneous', 'way', 'immediately', 'love', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'better', 'whole', 'storyline', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'rather', 'badly', 'handled', 'show', 'deviating', 'even', 'further', 'normally', 'history', 'Jane', 'had', 'been', 'court', 'year', 'Henry', 'Anne', 'even', 'married', 'treating', 'relationship', 'rather', 'tritely', 'Anita', 'Briem', 'best', 'efforts', 'material.On', 'plus', 'side', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'significantly', 'season', 'king', 'best', 'friend', 'Charles', 'Brandon', 'Brandon', 'growing', 'maturity', 'aside', 'philandering', 'ways', 'concentrate', 'family', 'life', 'contrast', 'Henry', 'constant', 'flitting', 'mistresses', 'also', 'growing', 'spiritual', 'crisis', 'faith', 'things', 'do', 'name', 'Reformation', 'theme', 'third', 'season.Overall', 'second', 'season', 'Tudors', '***', 'much', 'first', 'tosh', 'watchable', 'tosh', 'lot', 'details', 'history', 'wrong', 'succeed', 'nailing', 'broader', 'picture', 'However', 'second', 'season', 'elevated', 'first', 'richer', 'more', 'dramatic', 'events', 'being', 'depicted', 'improvements', 'writing', 'acting']",N/A

171919,A30TQET02FLSUX,1415743762,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[0, 0]","The latest TV show I've been catching up on is Showtime's sexy series The Tudors about King Henry VIII of England and his various wives.  I'm almost through watching Season 2 out of the three seasons that have aired so far.  The Tudors is a visual wonderland of architecture, landscape, and fashion.  The costumes and make-up work are unbelievable in their creative and colorful design...as is so often the case in these period pieces.  While the show does take some creative license with the accepted factual history of Henry VIII and the various characters surrounding him, I for one don't really care.  The reality is that when you make a story into a movie or a dramatic television show, you have to make the story and the characters work for the viewer to be entertained and interested.  So I find that if I am enjoying the story, I'm ok with it only being ""true"" on screen or ""based"" on a true story.  I think some filmmakers are so careful to be 100% faithful to ""fact"" that they craft a boring movie that is true instead of an interesting movie that stretches the ""truth"".  At the end of the day, we really don't know what actually happened almost 500 years ago.  Historians are now known to record history with a pretty biased point of view...even in today's modern world with millions of points of view.Along with the look and design of The Tudors, the acting is phenomenal and the show has a very sexy and modern feel to it.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers is perfectly suited to Henry VIII and Natalie Dormer is seductively thrilling as Anne Boleyn.  This show reminds me of one of my other favorite historical films made in recent years: Elizabeth (1998) starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush.  Directed by Shekhar Kapur, Elizabeth is really the stylistic pre-cursor to The Tudors series.  It's the story of King Henry VIII's controversial daughter with his second ""illegitimate"" wife Anne Boleyn, so in terms of story, it's a ""sequel"", but without Elizabeth, I doubt The Tudors would exist.Queen Elizabeth I was the first woman monarch to rule with the respect, love and fear of a King.  And Cate Blanchett made her mark as Elizabeth, and as an actress, with this role.  Shakespeare in Love (1998) won the Best Picture Oscar in 1998, but I think Elizabeth was actually the better overall film of the two...both movies are good though.  And Saving Private Ryan was the movie that should have won the Oscar that year!  I'm still burning mad at that controversial best picture race.",4,Sizzling Sexy,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,2503,"['latest', 'TV', 'show', ""'ve"", 'been', 'catching', 'up', 'Showtime', 'sexy', 'series', 'Tudors', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'England', 'various', 'wives', ""'m"", 'almost', 'watching', 'Season', '2', 'three', 'seasons', 'have', 'aired', 'so', 'far', 'Tudors', 'visual', 'wonderland', 'architecture', 'landscape', 'fashion', 'costumes', 'make-up', 'work', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'creative', 'colorful', 'design', 'as', 'so', 'often', 'case', 'period', 'pieces', 'show', 'take', 'creative', 'license', 'accepted', 'factual', 'history', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'various', 'characters', 'surrounding', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'reality', 'when', 'make', 'story', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'television', 'show', 'have', 'make', 'story', 'characters', 'work', 'viewer', 'be', 'entertained', 'interested', 'find', 'am', 'enjoying', 'story', ""'m"", 'ok', 'only', 'being', 'true', 'screen', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'so', 'careful', 'be', '100', '%', 'faithful', 'fact', 'craft', 'boring', 'movie', 'true', 'instead', 'interesting', 'movie', 'truth', 'end', 'day', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'almost', '500', 'years', 'ago', 'Historians', 'are', 'now', 'known', 'record', 'history', 'pretty', 'biased', 'point', 'view', 'even', 'today', 'modern', 'world', 'millions', 'points', 'view.Along', 'look', 'design', 'Tudors', 'acting', 'phenomenal', 'show', 'very', 'sexy', 'modern', 'feel', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Natalie', 'Dormer', 'seductively', 'thrilling', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'show', 'one', 'other', 'favorite', 'historical', 'films', 'made', 'recent', 'years', 'Elizabeth', '1998', 'starring', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Directed', 'Shekhar', 'Kapur', 'Elizabeth', 'really', 'stylistic', 'pre-cursor', 'Tudors', 'series', 'story', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'controversial', 'daughter', 'second', 'illegitimate', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'so', 'terms', 'story', 'sequel', 'Elizabeth', 'doubt', 'Tudors', 'would', 'exist.Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'first', 'woman', 'monarch', 'rule', 'respect', 'love', 'fear', 'King', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'made', 'mark', 'Elizabeth', 'actress', 'role', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', '1998', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', '1998', 'think', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'actually', 'better', 'overall', 'film', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'was', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'year', ""'m"", 'still', 'burning', 'mad', 'controversial', 'best', 'picture', 'race']",N/A

I was totally sick of it. However, when I started watching I got caught up in the acting, the costumes, the storyline.  While probably not historically 100% correct, this second season brought up a lot of the ""facts"" surrounding the beheading of the gorgeous Ms. Dormer (Anne). I'd see Anne of a Thousand Days and, per usual, Richard Burton's personally totally dominated that movie. And it was only a 2-hour movie. I don't agree that this series is being rushed. I had never really thought about the fact that Henry was manipulating his country's religious leanings and all he went through to do that, to create an environment where he could divorce his first wife and marry Anne. Yes I knew the basics but the miniscule workings were fascinating. I could be crude and tell it for what it was - it wasn't just about an heir, MALE heir, though that figured heavily.  Lust was certainly involved here (putting it nicely...). I also find it fascinating to see how Henry is changing (in the series).  The show finale was mesmerizing - slow, lush and, well, engrossing. While the Anne in this series was no lady and treated people with harshness, you had to respect how she handled delay after delay of her beheading.I am most definitely not a history buff but love historical movies. I love to see how people lived in that time, the language they used, the food they ate, clothes they wore. The Tudors is rift with those details.

171922,A1YG6XRDXPJYX,1415743762,"Breaking Sunrise ""Rhiannon""","[1, 1]",I have seen all the series and none of Henrys Queens can rival his Queen Anne!  She is not ever boring. Some see her as very bad and her choices as bad. But I see her asthe victim of her own fathers unfailing demands on her. I could never dislike her for all she does. I felt she was the most powerful Queen he had. I felther ruin was only b/c her fathers demands of her in his lust for power had no limits. It bothered me that the King did not kill him. When her power over Henry was at it'sstrongest it would have been a great time to bring down her awful father. She may have lasted longer. Wish she had. I found it really hard not to like her even from the start. But impossible not to like her when it was clear she really loved him. The cast was great in the time of her romance and reign as Queen. She was the only Queen whohad that much power with Henry. She was the only one he listened too. And she did help change Henry's mind on many important matters. I could never really understandhis best friends hatred toward her. Since many of the changes that occurred were in his favor too. I only felt if she had not become so frightened she may have been able to keep Henry much longer. Her brother was right when he tells her to be more like his first Queen. She should of overcome her fears and opposed her fathers demandsand used her wits to bring him down as he was her worse enemy and his decisions forced upon her led to her demise. The erotic passion between them was most awesomely unrivaled. I also could not believe as faithful as Cromwell was to the King and his friendship and similar beliefs with Anne and her family who had helped him rise could betray her so exquisitely  in the end. They were so like minded in their religious goals To free England from the horrid acts prior by the catholics cruelty andlack of value for life and forgiveness.  It was always entertaining and sexy when she and Henry were together. None of his Queens after her had any power at all. And since Henry seemed to bore easily with his consorts she kept his interest much longer and stronger than those to come. I never liked the Queens after her b/c they either were too  frightened to ever oppose him or in the child bride case too stupid to fear him. Maybe she did not accomplish her goals in life for all her enemies and ones that were just jealous of her. She could be called the Queen of Reformation as that was her most important achievement and influence on the King.She did give Henry what he wanted most and that was Elizabeth. I felt she was vindicated and not surprised As I felt she was his only Queen capable of giving such a strong willed child who would become one of the most powerful and just Queens to rule England. I also found the King of France as good and much more kind than Henry.  And their fight was hilarious by his sure larger size made that scene laughable. I do not know the history of their relationship but I think they were cousins. He also secretly seemed to believe in the reformation that again was encouraged by Anne. He also seemed to have respect for women. But all the hot sexy intense love affairs were gone along with the best cast heads lost by the time Henry killed Anne. The only one who ever came close to his equal. They all became boring and the young one was so stupid I could barely watch hertime as Queen. And his best friend was gorgeous but not without deceit against his King and so called best friend. I also never could figure out what he saw in Jane when they changed actresses on us it was as if the new one more regal but not as much his type as the one he saw that was replaced with the other and seemed less his type. She was goodbut it went down hill from the heat that was so intense between him and Anne. His fool was also a laughable eccentric element but I missed the constant excitement that only Queen Anne kept alive. It really went down hill as far as any of the Queens after Anne. None of them came close to being his equal as she did. This is just one opinion. Hard to not say Jonathan R. Myers was less impressive he was continuously great and a Hottie through them all.

Mom""","[0, 0]","Everyone has a guilty pleasure in their life, something that completely counters their alleged public tastes or persona, a taste or an activity which they might have a great deal of trouble admitting they indulge. Consider the health fanatic who secretly indulges in the occasional quart of Ben and Jerry's, the gourmet cook with a liking for chicken Mcnuggets, the litt&eacute;rateur who curls up with a good trashy Jacqueline Suzann novel. I write carefully researched historical novels, and take such care with the authenticity of them, that the pleasure of watching movies and television set in the same era and place that I specialize in is usually completely and comprehensively ruined, for I am taking note of every little anachronism or error.  But the Tudors - over the top, flashy, trashy and cheerfully, unashamedly inauthentic as to every category of historical detail - is my guilty pleasure. Yes, I know that all sorts of liberties have been taken with details of the lives of various prominent people at the court of Henry VIII, to the point where reviewers of the Tudors Season One are reduced to incoherent gibbering, and ordinarily I would be gibbering right along with them. But... the Tudors are still my guilty pleasure, and I think there may be two reasons for that. First - because the series dares to re-imagine a very familiar and of-told story, a story which was so complicated, which so well mingled the personal and political, and had such far-reaching effects. Secondly, it is authentic on a psychological level. Henry VIII was once young, dynamic and dangerously attractive, not the peevish middle-aged man in the usual more authentic visioning of his travails and wives. As played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, he is the central sun around which his administration and his court - more or less the same body of characters - revolve. Single-minded, absolutely determined to have his way in matters small and large, he is seen as rather a rock-star king. This may be very close to how he actually was in life, and his court just that scorpion-pit of conflicting and deadly ambitions. Because this is an extended series, there is space to examine some of the secondary threads and characters; in season one, it was the musician Thomas Tallis. In season 2 it is the character of Thomas More (Jeremy Northam), not quite the saint, but rather the lawyer and bureaucrat, increasingly disturbed by how matters are spinning out of control, deeply troubled by his inability to do anything about it or make the king listen to reason. By the end of this season, Henry has rid himself of another wife and has an eye on a third - and almost as an afterthought, separated the Church of England from the authority of the Pope in Rome.Oddly enough, only two of the features on this set have anything to do with the actual series: a tour of the Tower, and a short feature on various descendants of Henry VIII. All the rest are promotions and episodes of completely different series.

171930,A1T17LMQABMBN5,1415743762,CoffeeGurl,"[8, 9]","It seems to me that the Tudors are very popular these days.  Everyone and his/her grandmother have written a novel based on one of the characters (Anne Boleyn and Queen Elizabeth I are the most popular) and it appears that Hollywood is fast on its heels.  I enjoyed the first season of Showtime's The Tudors despite the fact that it focused more on Henry VIII's womanizing and debauchery than on the political aspects of the time.  In fact, season one was full of inaccuracies, some of them glaring, and I asked myself if the producers had bothered to hire a consultant or if they'd simply decided to create a fictional version of the era.  I thought it was sad, especially with such an incredible cast (Jeremy Northam, James Frain, Sam Neill, Nick Dunning). So, I was reluctant to watch the second season.  You can imagine my surprise that season two is more closely focused on real-life historical events and less enthusiastic about young Henry's exploits.The political stuff that took place during Anne Boleyn's reign, mainly Henry's decision to destroy the church, fascinated me, but what floored me the most was Natalie Dormer as Queen Anne.  She brought this character to life, making her as complex and as human as possible.  She isn't depicted as an evil vixen here, rather an ambitious and passionate woman who fought for what she wanted.  Yes, it is more than implied that her father had forced her to do many of the things she did, but she did them with her eyes wide open.  She was no doormat!  The season finale belonged to Dormer as she delivered one of the most emotive performances I've seen on television.  I was practically in tears.  That episode was all about Anne Boleyn and her execution, and she will be missed next season.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers does a wonderful job playing the young and charming Henry VIII.  The character is despicable, though he is sometimes also depicted as somehow nave about the people around him.  Meyers humanizes the character.  Henry shows a flicker of discomfort every now and then when it comes to ruining Catherine of Aragon and genuine pain for ordering to behead More.  The episode closes with Henry eating from a very creepy platter with a dead swan, which I think foreshadows his decline, looks-wise.  He gains weight around the time he's married to Jane Seymour.  Many great actors leave the series in this season (Northam, Dunning, and others), but new ones are introduced.  I look forward to watching season three.  One thing is certain though:  Dormer will be missed.",5,So much better than season one!

The production values here in these ten episodes may even have surpassed those of the first season, and Thomas More's quiet and protracted path to the executioner's block simply stole the series and overshadowed the heartrending final days of the much-betrayed Anne Bolelyn.The DVD extras for this second season were excellent, with the best of all being Natalie Dormer's visit to the real life sites of the imprisonment, execution, and entombment of the queen she portrayed.

171937,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,1415743762,Deborah Earle,"[2, 4]","Noticeably, many actors in this series have given some of their best performances during their scenes on the scaffold, giving memorable recitals of historically accurate speeches during their final appearances in this drama.The final episode of Season 2 of ""The Tudors"" begins with a dramatic scanning of the elegant broadsword that will kill a queen, wielded by French executioner, Jean Rombaud(Anatole Taubman), called from Calais for this judicial regicide.Thursday, May 18, 1536 is portrayed a foggy day around the Tower of London. We hear a chapel chorus of women singing ""Jerusalem, My Happy Home"" (which, in reality, would not be composed for another 44 years), until they are interrupted by the volatile Henry VIII( Jonathan Rhys-Meyers--a fine actor, but I still don't get him as Henry), whom in an irony that should not be lost on Tudor-era history buffs, is about to execute a woman reputed for her beautiful singing voice.Meanwhile, the beleagured Anne(Natalie Dormer), having witnessed the executions of her brother, George(Padraic Delaney), along with four other men accused of being her lovers including Court Musician Mark Smeaton (David Alpay),out of whom a confession was tortured, prays in her cell in the tower, where she is attended by three (in reality four) ladies-in-waiting, a chaplain, Constable Kingston(Steve Wilson), and has her confession of innocence of the charges against her heard by Bishop Cramner (Hans Matheson).Her two-and a-half-year-old daughter, Elizabeth (Kate Duggan) is tended to by Lady Margaret Bryan (Jane Brennan), unaware of the tragedy that is about to befall her. Her treatment at the beginning of this episode will be in sharp contrast to her treatment later on when her status changes.The bereaved young Mary Tudor(Sarah Bolger), who was ill-treated by Anne,and who is still in mourning for her mother, Catherine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy) receives very consoling news from Holy Roman Empire Ambassador Eustace Chapuys( Anthony Brophy) while finishing her prayers in a chapel.Charles Brandon( Henry Cavill) frolics with his son, Edward, gives Thomas Boleyn (Nick Dunning) the news of his release, and lays into the condemned Queen's father with a lambast that History would like to think he was actually given, if not by a person, than surely by his own conscience.James Frain's Thomas Cromwell carries out the King's mixed signals regarding the Queen's execution, but, here, is made out to be reluctant to do so, and is shown anxiously kneeling in prayer towards the end.The fortunes of Jane Seymour( the exquisite, delicate looking Icelandic actress, Anita Briem), are on the rise, and the contrasting scene of her preparing for the King's visit with Anne's preparations for the scaffold as Anne's chaplain recites from the Book of Ecclesiastes are very effective.Anne's ladies-in-waiting listen intently as the prisoner reminisces about her life at the Court of Queen Margaret of Austria.While praying again on her last night alive, Anne's thoughts fly to a delightful childhood memory.Then it is Friday, May 19th 1536...In a performance that should have landed Natalie Dormer a cabinet full of accolades, she reenacts the true-to-life bravery of a complicated woman who made an indelible impact on history in the face of her unjust demise, and whose posthumous compensation lay ahead with the 45-year reign of the feisty red-haired toddler she was leaving behind.Our last scenes of Anne are as a child in a loving moment with the father who later pimped her out to her fate.--A moment whose greater symbolism  may lie in the concept of Anne's permanent reunion with a Heavenly Father who would be infinitely more just, carrying her past the intrigues of the life she had previously known.--A gallant and undeniably moving swan-song indeed!The next day, the King sits down to dine on a swan pudding (an exclusive priviledge of Royals) to the applause of prudent courtiers who will keep silent about recent events and in so doing, keep their own heads.While the inaccuracies of this passion play have been rather off-putting, I can never deny the grandeur of the acting, nor the high drama and skillful portrayal of the historically correct scenes.A weeping Thomas Wyatt (Jamie Thomas King) was there to see his beloved Anne off. During this season, it had been his poetry which towards the end reflected the continuing devastation as ...""Around the Throne, the thunder rolls..""And so do the heads...",4,"Jerusalem, My Happy Home, Queen Anne Shall Soon Come to Thee...",1245024000,"06 15, 2009",2009,4460,"['Noticeably', 'many', 'actors', 'series', 'have', 'given', 'best', 'performances', 'scenes', 'scaffold', 'giving', 'memorable', 'recitals', 'historically', 'accurate', 'speeches', 'final', 'appearances', 'drama.The', 'final', 'episode', 'Season', '2', 'Tudors', 'dramatic', 'scanning', 'elegant', 'broadsword', 'will', 'kill', 'queen', 'wielded', 'French', 'executioner', 'Jean', 'Rombaud', 'Anatole', 'Taubman', 'called', 'Calais', 'judicial', 'regicide.Thursday', 'May', '18', '1536', 'portrayed', 'foggy', 'day', 'Tower', 'London', 'hear', 'chapel', 'chorus', 'women', 'singing', 'Jerusalem', 'My', 'Happy', 'Home', 'reality', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'composed', '44', 'years', 'are', 'interrupted', 'volatile', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'fine', 'actor', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Henry', 'whom', 'irony', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'lost', 'Tudor-era', 'history', 'buffs', 'execute', 'woman', 'reputed', 'beautiful', 'singing', 'voice.Meanwhile', 'beleagured', 'Anne', 'Natalie', 'Dormer', 'having', 'witnessed', 'executions', 'brother', 'George', 'Padraic', 'Delaney', 'four', 'other', 'men', 'accused', 'being', 'lovers', 'including', 'Court', 'Musician', 'Mark', 'Smeaton', 'David', 'Alpay', 'whom', 'confession', 'was', 'tortured', 'prays', 'cell', 'tower', 'where', 'attended', 'three', 'reality', 'four', 'ladies-in-waiting', 'chaplain', 'Constable', 'Kingston', 'Steve', 'Wilson', 'confession', 'innocence', 'charges', 'heard', 'Bishop', 'Cramner', 'Hans', 'Matheson', '.Her', 'two-and', 'a-half-year-old', 'daughter', 'Elizabeth', 'Kate', 'Duggan', 'tended', 'Lady', 'Margaret', 'Bryan', 'Jane', 'Brennan', 'unaware', 'tragedy', 'befall', 'treatment', 'beginning', 'episode', 'will', 'be', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'treatment', 'later', 'when', 'status', 'changes.The', 'bereaved', 'young', 'Mary', 'Tudor', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'who', 'was', 'ill-treated', 'Anne', 'who', 'still', 'mourning', 'mother', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', 'very', 'consoling', 'news', 'Holy', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'Ambassador', 'Eustace', 'Chapuys', 'Anthony', 'Brophy', 'finishing', 'prayers', 'chapel.Charles', 'Brandon', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'frolics', 'son', 'Edward', 'Thomas', 'Boleyn', 'Nick', 'Dunning', 'news', 'release', 'condemned', 'Queen', 'father', 'lambast', 'History', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'was', 'actually', 'given', 'not', 'person', 'surely', 'own', 'conscience.James', 'Frain', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'out', 'King', 'mixed', 'signals', 'regarding', 'Queen', 'execution', 'here', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'reluctant', 'do', 'so', 'shown', 'anxiously', 'kneeling', 'prayer', 'end.The', 'fortunes', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'exquisite', 'delicate', 'looking', 'Icelandic', 'actress', 'Anita', 'Briem', 'are', 'rise', 'contrasting', 'scene', 'preparing', 'King', 'visit', 'Anne', 'preparations', 'scaffold', 'Anne', 'chaplain', 'recites', 'Book', 'Ecclesiastes', 'are', 'very', 'effective.Anne', 'ladies-in-waiting', 'listen', 'intently', 'prisoner', 'life', 'Court', 'Queen', 'Margaret', 'Austria.While', 'praying', 'again', 'last', 'night', 'alive', 'Anne', 'thoughts', 'fly', 'delightful', 'childhood', 'memory.Then', 'Friday', 'May', '19th', '1536', 'performance', 'should', 'have', 'landed', 'Natalie', 'Dormer', 'cabinet', 'full', 'accolades', 'true-to-life', 'bravery', 'complicated', 'woman', 'who', 'made', 'indelible', 'impact', 'history', 'face', 'unjust', 'demise', 'posthumous', 'compensation', 'lay', 'ahead', '45-year', 'reign', 'feisty', 'red-haired', 'toddler', 'was', 'leaving', 'behind.Our', 'last', 'scenes', 'Anne', 'are', 'child', 'loving', 'moment', 'father', 'who', 'later', 'pimped', 'out', 'fate.', 'moment', 'greater', 'symbolism', 'may', 'lie', 'concept', 'Anne', 'permanent', 'reunion', 'Heavenly', 'Father', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'infinitely', 'more', 'just', 'carrying', 'intrigues', 'life', 'had', 'previously', 'known.', 'gallant', 'undeniably', 'moving', 'swan-song', 'indeed', 'next', 'day', 'King', 'down', 'dine', 'swan', 'pudding', 'exclusive', 'priviledge', 'Royals', 'applause', 'prudent', 'courtiers', 'who', 'will', 'keep', 'silent', 'recent', 'events', 'so', 'doing', 'keep', 'own', 'heads.While', 'inaccuracies', 'passion', 'play', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'off-putting', 'can', 'never', 'deny', 'grandeur', 'acting', 'high', 'drama', 'skillful', 'portrayal', 'historically', 'correct', 'scenes.A', 'weeping', 'Thomas', 'Wyatt', 'Jamie', 'Thomas', 'King', 'was', 'there', 'see', 'beloved', 'Anne', 'off', 'season', 'had', 'been', 'poetry', 'end', 'reflected', 'continuing', 'devastation', 'Throne', 'thunder', 'rolls..', 'so', 'do', 'heads']",N/A

I was concerned I might be a stickler for more accuracy in the casting of Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the lead, but I quickly got over the casting of such a young, handsome actor as the king.  He portrayed the petulant and spoiled monarch well enough that the disparity in the age and the lack of corpulence was a pleasure to overlook.  I frequently loan out the entire series to friends and family and it is always a hit.  The torture scenes are unfortunately very well done and I often have to turn away as they are tragic and disturbing. (spoiler:  I am referring to you, poor handsome violinist!).We visited London shortly after watching the entire season and it made visiting the Tower of London so much more enjoyable and meaningful.

The differences between the 2 seasons are minute, but I have to say that this season *slightly* disappointed me because it really ""zoomed"" through several events (things that took several years in real life are usually given only 1/2-3/4 of an episode). That being said, I still adore the fact that Jonathan Rhys Meyer's Henry VIII is so invigorating, seductive, and MESMERIZING on screen. Every time I watch the show, my mind is saying, ""Wait a minute, Henry is about 38 right now. His abs should NOT be washboard. He doesn't look a day over 30!"" But something about JRM's portrayal (his hard work, energy, and enthusiasm for the character) pretty much gets rid of all that I KNOW historically about Henry VIII. It makes me not care that his Henry doesn't have red hair and is only about 5'9 instead of 6'3.I LOVED the season finale. Natalie Dormer gets such kudos for a riveting, emotional, fascinating, graceful exit from the show as Anne Boleyn. I wish the producers would find a way to slip her into any upcoming episodes, but with her distinctive face, that would be impossible. I agree with another one of the reviewers that I find myself depressed over the fact that Anne B./Natalie D. is gone for good.

As I finished each episode, I could barely wait for the next one, and there were occasions when I watched two or three episodes back to back, getting me to bed late and leaving me tired the next day -- but it was worth it. It's said that time flies when you're having fun, and some of these episodes felt like only 5 or 10 minutes. My wife had the same response.The power of this series is a result of achieving excellence in all facets. The actors are uniformly convincing, the scenery is authentic and transporting, and the pacing and dynamics of the plot have a perfect ebb and flow. Many key dimensions of the human experience are represented, such as romance, (hot) sex, power politics, attempts at justice, friendship, revenge, religious conflict, glimpses of ordinary life, and violence so brutal that we tender Americans can scarcely comprehend or stomach it.As to historical accuracy, I'm not qualified to judge with expertise, but I suspect that they got the general contours reasonably right, even if some details are debatable. Moreover, none of us were actually there and reconstructing the past always involves much inference, so a useful approximation is all we can aim for anyway. I would hope that anyone watching or reading a historical work will know to take things with a grain of salt, especially the details.Some lessons I drew from the series are: (a) I'm glad I don't live in the England of this period, (b) being King isn't all it's cracked up to be, and (c) check your ambition and stay away from highly powerful people, lest you fall out of favor and wind up damaged or worse.Highly recommended to anyone interested in the European history of this period (particularly that of England), or to anyone who just enjoys great drama.Note: I've watched all three seasons and they're all equally excellent, so I've posted this review for all three.",5,Totally gripping (again),1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,1937,"['most', 'gripping', 'dramatic', 'historical', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'finished', 'episode', 'could', 'barely', 'wait', 'next', 'one', 'were', 'occasions', 'when', 'watched', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'back', 'back', 'getting', 'bed', 'late', 'leaving', 'tired', 'next', 'day', 'was', 'worth', 'said', 'time', 'flies', 'when', ""'re"", 'having', 'fun', 'episodes', 'felt', 'only', '5', '10', 'minutes', 'wife', 'had', 'same', 'response.The', 'power', 'series', 'result', 'achieving', 'excellence', 'facets', 'actors', 'are', 'uniformly', 'convincing', 'scenery', 'authentic', 'transporting', 'pacing', 'dynamics', 'plot', 'have', 'perfect', 'ebb', 'flow', 'Many', 'key', 'dimensions', 'human', 'experience', 'are', 'represented', 'such', 'romance', 'hot', 'sex', 'power', 'politics', 'attempts', 'justice', 'friendship', 'revenge', 'religious', 'conflict', 'glimpses', 'ordinary', 'life', 'violence', 'so', 'brutal', 'tender', 'Americans', 'can', 'scarcely', 'comprehend', 'stomach', 'it.As', 'historical', 'accuracy', ""'m"", 'not', 'qualified', 'judge', 'expertise', 'suspect', 'got', 'general', 'contours', 'reasonably', 'right', 'even', 'details', 'are', 'debatable', 'Moreover', 'none', 'were', 'actually', 'there', 'reconstructing', 'past', 'always', 'much', 'inference', 'useful', 'approximation', 'can', 'aim', 'anyway', 'would', 'hope', 'anyone', 'watching', 'reading', 'historical', 'work', 'will', 'know', 'take', 'things', 'grain', 'salt', 'especially', 'details.Some', 'lessons', 'drew', 'series', 'are', ""'m"", 'glad', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'England', 'period', 'b', 'being', 'King', ""n't"", 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'c', 'check', 'ambition', 'stay', 'away', 'highly', 'powerful', 'people', 'lest', 'fall', 'favor', 'wind', 'up', 'damaged', 'worse.Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'interested', 'European', 'history', 'period', 'particularly', 'England', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'great', 'drama.Note', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'three', 'seasons', ""'re"", 'equally', 'excellent', 'so', ""'ve"", 'posted', 'review', 'three']",N/A

This story is so great that it's really a treat to see it detailed as closely as it is here; unfortunately, the recipe for the mini-series seems to be ""DALLAS at the Palace,"" so the retelling of historical events is so altered here as to be sometimes unrecognizable. The producers' bizarre decision to star tiny, tightbodied Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as the famously tall and corpulent Henry VIII makes even less sense than the previous season, particularly given Rhys-Meyers' incredibly limited acting range (he seems to be able to portray only three emotions: lustfulness, sulkiness, and fury). Shouting out a large proportion of his lines, this Henry VIII gnaws the scenery instead of a giant turkey leg, and he seems barely capable of growing a tiny dark peachfuzz mustache and goatee. Because Rhys-Meyers is so young, the producers and directors decided to put him in as few scenes as possible with his eldest benighted daughter the Princess Mary, which is a terrible mistake since she's about the only person you can possibly feel sorry for in this version of the story.Natalie Dormer fares much better than her co-star as his doomed wife, Anne Boleyn, and is genuinely beautiful and seductive; however, as with Rhys-Meyers, it's practically impossible to believe her as one of the leading intellectual lights of the English Reformation. But she is genuinely excellent in the season's fine final episode, where the condemned Anne is purified beyond fear and finally accepts her fate with the grace and dignity becoming a queen. Even better is Maria Doyle Kennedy, who does not have enough to do as the rejected Katharine of Aragon except pine and look unhappy. Most of the actors seem to have been chosen for their beautiful bodies; you will never see so many washboard abs in a gym as you do at this Tudor court.

Mullally ""booklover4ever00""","[1, 3]","While the series is very loosely based on the events of the life of Henry VIII the performances by JR Meyers and Jeremy Northam as Sir Thomas More really make the piece.Natalie Dormer is pitch perfect as Anne, even if we can see through her and her family and find her annoying!Maria Doyle Kennedy as the Queen is superb. She is warm, human, dignified and we actually feel sorry for all the king is throwing away for a woman who ultimately proved to not be worth it. And how much he will destroy in England in the process.Henry as a 'sleeping lion' is wonderfully portrayed. The series is not as much of a 'bonkbuster' as the first one, though there are sexy bits, but there is a LOT of interesting stuff that will pique your interest in the real history if you can get past the nudie bits.It is a treat seeing Peter O'Toole as the new pope, the one who commissions Michaelangelo to do a bit of work here and there-very amusing.The Mark Smeaton parts were a bit silly, and partly for shock value and more sex, but I think they were trying to show a bit about the 'common man' and how all the men fascinated by Anne go to their doom except Thomas Wyatt, who as he says, was the only one who WAS guilty of ever having slept with her.The scenes between Henry and Anne which used to light up the screen become more and more sad, as he realizes he has turned his whole world upside down for a woman who lies to him.Also notice his loyal cortege of friends is now gone and the court rooms are curiously bare considering how busy the palace would have been at that time.  He is frequently alone, and even in the crowd scenes, he is with one person or another manuipulating.We start out so romantically with Anne, but soon  they are barely in the same county, let alone room. (GREAT acting). The death of John Fisher and Thomas More are the beginning of the end, and Anne's paranoid delusions and pathetic attempts to get back her power are painful to watch, they are so moving.Sad to say, Anne lasted less than 3 years, but the chaos she caused certainly makes true what he says to Chapuys--I want my reign to be remembered forever. --No doubt not the long and bloody and scandalous one it ended up being.And yet the union of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII gave us the worst and best queens England ever had, Mary (the Bloody)and Elizabeth, and shaped its destiny just as Anne herself did.We can never be sure how much her zeal for 'reform' was a grab for money, power, and in defiance of the church in trying to push through the divorce and marrying Henry, but there is no doubt the protestant reformation had the door opened through her and her family's cunning.The costumes, settings and acting make this, while not perfect, certainly an excellent way to savor history and the period, and it is a lot more historically accurate and uses many of the actual documents of the time.One complaint-why is Suffolk so wooden now-he always looks agrrieved but never says anything. By the way, keep an eye on his wife-she was slated to be wife #7 of Henry's!! but Katherine Parr lived and he died! Phew, lucky escape....Can't wait to see how the Third Season plays out with the Seymours and how far we get with his other 4 wives...",5,Rivetting and much more historically accurate,1239408000,"04 11, 2009",2009,3213,"['series', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'events', 'life', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'performances', 'JR', 'Meyers', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'More', 'really', 'make', 'piece.Natalie', 'Dormer', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Anne', 'even', 'can', 'see', 'family', 'find', 'annoying', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', 'Queen', 'superb', 'warm', 'human', 'dignified', 'actually', 'feel', 'sorry', 'king', 'throwing', 'away', 'woman', 'who', 'ultimately', 'proved', 'not', 'be', 'how', 'much', 'will', 'destroy', 'England', 'process.Henry', ""'sleeping"", 'lion', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'series', 'not', 'as', 'much', ""'bonkbuster"", 'first', 'one', 'are', 'sexy', 'bits', 'LOT', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'will', 'pique', 'interest', 'real', 'history', 'can', 'get', 'nudie', 'bits.It', 'treat', 'seeing', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'new', 'pope', 'one', 'who', 'Michaelangelo', 'do', 'bit', 'work', 'here', 'there-very', 'amusing.The', 'Mark', 'Smeaton', 'parts', 'were', 'bit', 'silly', 'partly', 'shock', 'value', 'more', 'sex', 'think', 'were', 'trying', 'show', 'bit', ""'common"", 'man', 'how', 'men', 'fascinated', 'Anne', 'go', 'doom', 'Thomas', 'Wyatt', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'WAS', 'guilty', 'ever', 'having', 'slept', 'her.The', 'scenes', 'Henry', 'Anne', 'used', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'sad', 'turned', 'whole', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'woman', 'who', 'him.Also', 'notice', 'loyal', 'cortege', 'friends', 'now', 'gone', 'court', 'rooms', 'are', 'curiously', 'bare', 'considering', 'how', 'busy', 'palace', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'time', 'frequently', 'alone', 'even', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'one', 'person', 'manuipulating.We', 'start', 'so', 'romantically', 'Anne', 'soon', 'are', 'barely', 'same', 'county', 'let', 'alone', 'room', 'GREAT', 'acting', 'death', 'John', 'Fisher', 'Thomas', 'More', 'are', 'beginning', 'end', 'Anne', 'paranoid', 'delusions', 'pathetic', 'attempts', 'get', 'back', 'power', 'are', 'painful', 'watch', 'are', 'so', 'moving.Sad', 'say', 'Anne', 'lasted', 'less', '3', 'years', 'chaos', 'caused', 'certainly', 'true', 'what', 'Chapuys', 'want', 'reign', 'be', 'remembered', 'forever', 'doubt', 'not', 'long', 'bloody', 'scandalous', 'one', 'ended', 'up', 'being.And', 'yet', 'union', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'gave', 'worst', 'best', 'queens', 'England', 'ever', 'had', 'Mary', 'Bloody', 'Elizabeth', 'shaped', 'destiny', 'just', 'Anne', 'did.We', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'zeal', ""'reform"", 'was', 'grab', 'money', 'power', 'defiance', 'church', 'trying', 'push', 'divorce', 'marrying', 'Henry', 'doubt', 'protestant', 'reformation', 'had', 'door', 'opened', 'family', 'cunning.The', 'costumes', 'settings', 'acting', 'make', 'not', 'perfect', 'certainly', 'excellent', 'way', 'savor', 'history', 'period', 'lot', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'many', 'actual', 'documents', 'time.One', 'complaint-why', 'Suffolk', 'so', 'wooden', 'now-he', 'always', 'agrrieved', 'never', 'anything', 'way', 'keep', 'eye', 'wife-she', 'was', 'slated', 'be', 'wife', '7', 'Henry', 'Katherine', 'Parr', 'lived', 'died', 'Phew', 'lucky', 'escape', '.Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'how', 'Third', 'Season', 'out', 'Seymours', 'how', 'far', 'get', 'other', '4', 'wives']",N/A

Menta, Jr.","[0, 0]","Season two of ""The Tudors"" offers ten engaging, often emotional, episodes revolving around the issues and happenings in King Henry VIII's court during the period of his marriage to Anne Boleyn.  It's to the show's credit that we still feel great sympathy for Queen Anne and Henry's friend Sir Thomas More when they meet their ultimate fates, as the creative forces behind the stories weren't afraid to also let us see their unsavory and less than noble aspects prior to their well documented ends.That's a generally strong point of ""The Tudors"": the presentation of the players in all their positive and negative glory.  You may have favorites among the characters, but it won't be because the producers are stacking the deck by presenting them in a better light than history says they may warrant.  If there's one character, however, who is increasingly a challenge to like at all in these episodes, it's King Henry himself, who revels more and more in his power and lusts as the season progresses.  This doesn't make him any less interesting to watch, but he ultimately comes off not so much as a man of great complexity, just one of great appetites.Season two of ""The Tudors"" looks serviceably well on standard DVD, and the final disc contains a small handful of brief but interesting extra features.  One of the better featurettes shows actress Natalie Dormer, who plays Anne Boleyn in the program, visiting the final resting place of the real Queen Anne, as a local historian fills her in on the details on the Queen's last days.

Natalie Dormer brings grit and moxie to her role as Anne Boleyn, and while Henry VIII was a bit older than Rhys-Meyers appears, it's amazing to watch as the king slides into the megalomania that characterized the second half of his reign. Nick Dunning is spot on as Anne's  cunning, cold father. Unfortunately, Anita Briem is miscast as Henry's next paramour, Jane Seymour, who was not the beautiful, nubile temptress portrayed here. The highlight of this season, of course, is the execution of Queen Anne, and what a death scene Ms. Dormer turns in, showing the mettle that gave Anne the power to dethrone a sitting queen. And the final scene, Henry enjoying a ""subtlety"", reveals him as the selfish tyrant that he truly was.This is a grand, sumptuous production, with eye popping costumes and scenery.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[0, 1]","""The Tudors"" charges through season two with more of the backstabbing politics, greedy hangers-on, steamy bedroom scenes and pious prayers that made season one compelling from beginning to end.Jonathan Rhys Meyers returns as Henry VIII, who is now married to Anne Boleyn, played brilliantly by Natalie Dormer.  Dormer conveys as much with her facial expressions as many actors can accomplish with their full performance.  Katherine of Aragon is in isolation, cut off not only from her husband of many years and her place on the throne, but also, cruelly, from their daughter, Princess Mary.  Maria Doyle Kennedy is one of the strongest assets of the series.Jeremy Northam is superb as the Man for all Seasons, Thomas More, Henry's friend and wise, trusted, spiritual advisor, who can't bring himself to say that in religious matters the King's word is superior to the Pope.This season is more historically accurate than season one, which writer Michael Hirst said was ""85% accurate"".  But this season also shares the consummate production values of the previous work.  The sets, costumes, music, editing, cinematography and acting are all first rate.  If you liked season one, I daresay you'll like season two as well.  If you're interested in historical dramas with a tad of artistic license - I recommend you start back at season one.The Mrs. says this is one of those shows you KNOW is good, because as soon as one episode ends you can't WAIT for the next episode.

The problem is that everything happens so darn FAST! In Season 2, Henry VIII (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) marries Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer), who gives birth to Princess Elizabeth, the child who eventually will become Queen of England. However, Season 2 also depicts Henry forcing everyone in England to take ""The Great Oath"" promising to support Elizabeth's right to the throne. Sir Thomas More (Jeremy Northam) is murdered, Katharine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy) dies, Henry is excommunicated by the Pope (Peter O'Toole), Anne has a bunch of miscarriages and falls out of Henry's good graces, Henry starts screwing around on Anne and eventually becomes obsessed with Jane Seymour (Anita Briem), the entire Boleyn family is brought down, and Anne loses her head. (And no, I am not spoiling anything for people who haven't watched all the episodes yet...anyone who has even a mediocre grasp of history knows what happens in this story!)The fact that ""The Tudors"" has only aired for two seasons and the character of Anne Boleyn is already dead depresses the hell out of me. Why does Showtime feel the need to rush everything? The series is based on such vivid historical characters, and ""The Tudors"" would be a much better program if the writers just slowed everything down and spent more time allowing the events to unfold. This season spanned at least five years (of course, none of the characters appear to have aged a day...imagine that!). I'm especially disappointed that Dormer will most likely not return next season, because she was the best part of the show. Also, the character of Anne was generally portrayed as an innocent victim in the series, but the character of Henry becomes darker and more sinister with each passing episode. There is nothing likeable or redeeming about him at all anymore, which is unfortunate, as he is the central focus of the series.Where will ""The Tudors"" go from here? At this rate, Henry should be dead by the end of Season 3 and Elizabeth should be on the throne early into Season 4. Unless the show slows down a bit, though, I honestly don't think it will last much longer.

172009,A228JH8V9Y700G,1415743762,MortensOrchid,"[0, 0]","The second season of The Tudors was the most innovative and most action packed, as the years that Henry VIII was married to Anne Bolyn were perhaps the most turbulent years of the British monarchy and ramifications in Western Civilization.  Henry divorced his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and married Anne Bolyn, believing that she was going to produce the much hoped for son to continue his legacy on the British throne.  What we do not think about is Catherine, left to rot in her own filth and not even allowed to see her and Henry's daughter, Mary.  Mary, a teenager in this movie, is growing up resenting her father for divorcing her mother and outraged at the political and religious changes that his marriage has caused.  She is foreshadowing her own rule in several years, when she becomes queen and will become fanatical about restoring the Catholic faith to England.  But in the meantime, Henry's second marriage to Anne does not pan out as anyone intended.Anne will famously not deliver the much hoped for son.  The child that she gives birth to after they marry is a girl, and she apologizes for it.  Henry at first hopes that since they are both still young and fertile that they will go on to have more children; but, so much for Anne, she does not produce another surviving child, let alone a son.  Henry's eyes begin to wander to other mistresses, as he has always done, and soon Anne falls out of favor with him.  It is a rather complicated series of events that unfold that lead to her eventual imprisonment in the Tower, but Anne was never truly accepted by many of the people of England, let alone Henry's political and religious opponents who were already trying to establish powers.  Soon, Henry begins to hate Anne, believing that she betrayed and tricked him into marriage.  Accusations of adultery and incest will follow Anne, until Henry decides, becoming ever more prideful and gluttonous, to forgo another divorce and simply have Anne executed.Perhaps the hardest parts to watch were the ailing deaths of Catherine, his first wife, who was living in exile in her country estate, saying she would forever be the true queen of England.  And Anne, imprisoned in The Tower, getting to watch her brother's execution from her prison window, only to wait for her own beheading.  There was quite a bit of confusion in the days leading up to her execution, as a special swordsman from France was coming in to do the deed and give her a much quicker and less painful death.  His journey was delayed for several days, and Anne thought that today was her day.  When he finally did arrive, Anne met her maker in the Tower courtyard.  Henry has already chosen what would be his third wife, Jane Seymore, and not making a secret of it from Anne or others.  And, like they say, the rest is history.The special features show a short tour of the Tower and the place where Anne was executed.  A nice compliment to things other than the obvious soap opera that would ensue of Henry and his wants.",5,The hottest season ever!,1311465600,"07 24, 2011",2011,3008,"['second', 'season', 'Tudors', 'was', 'most', 'innovative', 'most', 'action', 'packed', 'years', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'was', 'married', 'Anne', 'Bolyn', 'were', 'perhaps', 'most', 'turbulent', 'years', 'British', 'monarchy', 'ramifications', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'Henry', 'divorced', 'first', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'married', 'Anne', 'Bolyn', 'believing', 'was', 'going', 'produce', 'much', 'hoped', 'son', 'continue', 'legacy', 'British', 'throne', 'What', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Catherine', 'left', 'rot', 'own', 'filth', 'not', 'even', 'allowed', 'see', 'Henry', 'daughter', 'Mary', 'Mary', 'teenager', 'movie', 'growing', 'up', 'resenting', 'father', 'divorcing', 'mother', 'outraged', 'political', 'religious', 'changes', 'marriage', 'caused', 'foreshadowing', 'own', 'rule', 'several', 'years', 'when', 'queen', 'will', 'become', 'fanatical', 'restoring', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'England', 'meantime', 'Henry', 'second', 'marriage', 'Anne', 'not', 'pan', 'out', 'anyone', 'intended.Anne', 'will', 'famously', 'not', 'deliver', 'much', 'hoped', 'son', 'child', 'birth', 'marry', 'girl', 'Henry', 'first', 'hopes', 'are', 'still', 'young', 'fertile', 'will', 'go', 'have', 'more', 'children', 'so', 'much', 'Anne', 'not', 'produce', 'surviving', 'child', 'let', 'alone', 'son', 'Henry', 'eyes', 'begin', 'wander', 'other', 'mistresses', 'always', 'done', 'soon', 'Anne', 'favor', 'rather', 'complicated', 'series', 'events', 'unfold', 'lead', 'eventual', 'imprisonment', 'Tower', 'Anne', 'was', 'never', 'truly', 'accepted', 'many', 'people', 'England', 'let', 'alone', 'Henry', 'political', 'religious', 'opponents', 'who', 'were', 'already', 'trying', 'establish', 'powers', 'Soon', 'Henry', 'hate', 'Anne', 'believing', 'betrayed', 'tricked', 'marriage', 'Accusations', 'adultery', 'incest', 'will', 'follow', 'Anne', 'Henry', 'decides', 'becoming', 'ever', 'more', 'prideful', 'gluttonous', 'forgo', 'divorce', 'simply', 'have', 'Anne', 'executed.Perhaps', 'hardest', 'parts', 'watch', 'were', 'ailing', 'deaths', 'Catherine', 'first', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'living', 'exile', 'country', 'estate', 'saying', 'would', 'forever', 'be', 'true', 'queen', 'England', 'Anne', 'imprisoned', 'Tower', 'getting', 'watch', 'brother', 'execution', 'prison', 'window', 'only', 'wait', 'own', 'beheading', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'confusion', 'days', 'leading', 'up', 'execution', 'special', 'swordsman', 'France', 'was', 'coming', 'do', 'deed', 'give', 'much', 'quicker', 'less', 'painful', 'death', 'journey', 'was', 'delayed', 'several', 'days', 'Anne', 'thought', 'today', 'was', 'day', 'When', 'finally', 'did', 'arrive', 'Anne', 'met', 'maker', 'Tower', 'courtyard', 'Henry', 'already', 'chosen', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'third', 'wife', 'Jane', 'Seymore', 'not', 'making', 'secret', 'Anne', 'others', 'say', 'rest', 'history.The', 'special', 'features', 'show', 'short', 'tour', 'Tower', 'place', 'where', 'Anne', 'was', 'executed', 'nice', 'compliment', 'things', 'other', 'obvious', 'soap', 'opera', 'would', 'ensue', 'Henry']",N/A

Please read on.Meet Henry VIII as he was as a young man: a political rock star -- handsome, robust, wild, spoiled, and hot-tempered. Everything he wanted, he got -- except for that elusive male heir...The Tudors (SII) is an absolutely gorgeous visual ode to one of the most controversial chapters in Western political history. The series itself is a dazzling celebration of Tudor-era music (a precursor to our own pop music), stunning costumes, lovely, lusty women and handsome manly men, breathtaking castles and Tudor manors. Season II is even more provocative, dangerous, and sexy than the first season. Bravo, Showtime, for producing such a lush, thoughtful, and beautifully produced series that is above all an intelligent meditation on the shifting nature of politics and the dangers of gross imbalances of political power.I am a literary scholar who specializes in this period and I love the adaptation, despite some of its loose treatment of dates and persons. The series captures the tumultuous *spirit* of Henry's era. The series allows us to peer into this astonishing historical moment, the instant when England broke from the Church of Rome. The future of politics and the state of nations would never be the same. Another plus: Henry's queens are brought to life beautifully by Maria Doyle Kennedy (as the pious and determined Katherine of Aragon) and by the newcomer Natalie Dormer, who excellently plays the controversial Anne Boleyn as a fierce social-climber haunted by her past and troubled by her father's rabid political manipulations. Dormer's Boleyn has a look deep in her eyes that shows us that she knows, in her soul, that she is doomed. This is a testament to Dormer as a young actress; she shows us the ""arc"" of Anne Boleyn as Anne/Natalie matures from a young and ambitious mistress to-the-king to a neglected, then persecuted, wife and lonely mother (to Elizabeth I, future great queen). JRM is also splendidly original as Henry: brash, lustful, and temperamental. We can believe in his Henry's burning love for Anne as well as his eventual hatred for her and his willingness to have the mother of his child executed.This series is in my opinion the finest vision of this time period, superior to A Man for All Seasons, Anne of the Thousand Days, the Elizabeth I series with Helen Mirren, and numerous others. This series has sparkle and spirit in addition to rich intelligence (evidenced by its well-composed screenplay), smart casting choices (though Joss Stone is still a question mark for me as Anne of Cleves), and sensational locations.

I had an unusual advantage over most viewers: as an American (albeit of English descent on both sides) I knew very little about the life and times of Henry VIII.  (The schools here do not cover him more than to say that he broke with Roman Catholicism over the issue of divorce.)  Accordingly, I was shocked at the fate of Anne Boleyn.  I was afraid that this period of English history would prove to be a bore.  Not at all.  King Henry VIII is a fascinating personality and political study, well presented here.  This season kindled an interest on my part in this period of English history, and while the series no doubt takes liberties with history, as television always does, nonetheless this series appears to be substantively correct in its presentation.Probably the main fallacy of this series is simply how good-looking everyone is, but that's show-biz.  The casting of this series is impeccable in my view, the sets are fantastic, and the storytelling is rivetting.  This one will leave the viewer anxious to watch Season Three of The Tudors.

172047,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,1415743762,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 1]","""The Tudors"" continues its sumptuous examination of the oversized reign of young Henry VIII (Jonathan Rhys Meyers).  While the first season saw a lot of minor-league politicking and bedchambering, Season Two is where this series grows up.King Henry continues to jockey for the right to marry the enchanting Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer).  The increasingly brazen king is opposed both by the continental monarchs of Europe who are beholden to the Pope (a fantastic Peter O'Toole) and the Catholic Church as well as several of his own subjects who are appalled both by the abandonment of the church as well as Harry's treatment of Queen Catherine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy).  Sir Thomas More (Jeremy Notham), Harry's one-time friend and counselor, struggles to walk the fine line of neither supporting nor condemning the King.  This task grows ever more difficult as Henry, egged on by ambitious aides and advisors, imposes strict loyalty oaths and other manipulations worthy of a police state.The wheels of power chew up and spit out a healthy portion of the cast in Season Two - everyone is playing for high stakes.  We all know people who say ""history is boring,"" in large part because history, when taught poorly, is often told as a succession of inevitable events.  Here, we know that Henry's daughter by Anne Boleyn is destined to rule one day as Elizabeth I.  However, Season Two demonstrates just how precarious her position was as there are many powerful players who want her dead.  Season Two does a fine job of keeping the drama flying so quickly that we often forget that we know the fate of so many of the actors.And the acting is fine here across the board - Notham, Kennedy, and Dormer each take turns stealing entire episodes.  But the show is first and foremost anchored by JRM, who's performance has been controversial.  I am a fan - he combines the peevy entitlement of a young man who is given a kingdom as a plaything with the righteous majesty of a monarch who will not be denied.  Much of the criticism levied at JRM seems to be more correctly aimed at the character of young Harry, who by any account is a spoiled man.There is plenty of bedchambering in Season Two even if it does not hit the heights of the first season - but this is a movie to be enjoyed for its romance as well as for its political intrigue.If you're interested in the series, start with the first season and work to here - you'll be glad you did.",4,"Politics and power take center stage in ""The Tudors, Season 2""",1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,2443,"['Tudors', 'sumptuous', 'examination', 'oversized', 'reign', 'young', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'first', 'season', 'saw', 'lot', 'minor-league', 'politicking', 'bedchambering', 'Season', 'Two', 'where', 'series', 'up.King', 'Henry', 'jockey', 'right', 'marry', 'enchanting', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'Natalie', 'Dormer', 'increasingly', 'brazen', 'king', 'opposed', 'continental', 'monarchs', 'Europe', 'who', 'are', 'beholden', 'Pope', 'fantastic', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Catholic', 'Church', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'own', 'subjects', 'who', 'are', 'appalled', 'abandonment', 'church', 'as', 'well', 'Harry', 'treatment', 'Queen', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'More', 'Jeremy', 'Notham', 'Harry', 'one-time', 'friend', 'counselor', 'walk', 'fine', 'line', 'supporting', 'condemning', 'King', 'task', 'ever', 'more', 'difficult', 'Henry', 'egged', 'ambitious', 'aides', 'advisors', 'imposes', 'strict', 'loyalty', 'oaths', 'other', 'manipulations', 'police', 'state.The', 'wheels', 'power', 'chew', 'up', 'spit', 'out', 'healthy', 'portion', 'cast', 'Season', 'Two', 'everyone', 'playing', 'high', 'stakes', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'history', 'boring', 'large', 'part', 'history', 'when', 'taught', 'poorly', 'often', 'told', 'succession', 'inevitable', 'events', 'Here', 'know', 'Henry', 'daughter', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'destined', 'rule', 'one', 'day', 'Elizabeth', 'However', 'Season', 'Two', 'just', 'how', 'precarious', 'position', 'was', 'are', 'many', 'powerful', 'players', 'who', 'want', 'dead', 'Season', 'Two', 'fine', 'job', 'keeping', 'drama', 'flying', 'so', 'quickly', 'often', 'forget', 'know', 'fate', 'so', 'many', 'actors.And', 'acting', 'fine', 'here', 'board', 'Notham', 'Kennedy', 'Dormer', 'take', 'stealing', 'entire', 'episodes', 'show', 'first', 'foremost', 'anchored', 'JRM', 'who', 'performance', 'been', 'controversial', 'am', 'fan', 'peevy', 'entitlement', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'given', 'kingdom', 'plaything', 'righteous', 'majesty', 'monarch', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'Much', 'criticism', 'levied', 'JRM', 'be', 'more', 'correctly', 'aimed', 'character', 'young', 'Harry', 'who', 'account', 'spoiled', 'man.There', 'plenty', 'bedchambering', 'Season', 'Two', 'even', 'not', 'hit', 'heights', 'first', 'season', 'movie', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'romance', 'as', 'well', 'political', 'intrigue.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'series', 'start', 'first', 'season', 'work', 'here', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did']",N/A

In addition to the fact that Anne has not produced a son, her relationship with Henry begins to unravel because Henry regrets all that he has done to assist Anne's rise to power-including killing some of his friends and breaking with Rome.A good series, one that I have enjoyed watching with the caveat that pretty much every one of these characters is totally detestable. Unlike the HBO series Rome which weaved some fictional and totally endearing characters into the fabric of historical drama, Showtime has focused on the seedy side of the players in the Tudor dynasty and hasn't rounded them out with tender bits. Without characters to like, this series can be a bit taxing as there isn't anyone you feel particularly fond of and drawn to. You even end up hating the gentle and loving Sir Thomas More after he turns sanctimonious and begins a campaign of burning people at the stake. I continue to watch this series because I like historical drama and setting. Showtime has done an excellent job with actors, setting, production.In addition to the lack of character development, my other complaint is that there is an almost boring repetition from episode to episode which goes along the lines of sex, jousting, political wrangling, war or talk of it, dancing, praying and repeat with a few scenes of ladies doing needlepoint and horse riding thrown in for good measure. Think I'm kidding? Watch a few episodes and track it. The repetition of this pattern was much worse in season one than season two however.If you like political intrigue, I highly suggest watching theRome Gift Set (HBO Series)series or the even more excellentHouse of Cards Trilogy (House of Cards / To Play the King / The Final Cut)by the BBC.

Waiting for the executioner's sword, she has flashbacks to when she was six or seven years old.  Flashbacks of a happy little girl and a wonderful family that loved her.  There was laughter and joy in her world.  People who embraced her, kissed her, and protected her.  This three minute scene will tear your heart out.  This scene alone is worth every penny you spent on this DVD. Bravo to the Director, Writer, and Cinemaphotographer.And there is one other scene before this one, that is exceptional.  Five year old future queen Elizabeth is told by her governess that if she doesn't behave, she is going to hit her.  The look on that child's face is priceless.
