1283335,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B002Q02FRS,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[6, 7]","Smarting from a hurtful breakup with his twinkish lover, 29 year old Parisian Jerome (Eric Debets) decides a change of scenery is needed, so he decides to pursue his dream of going to Hollywood and try to become an actor. He takes a room at a seedy Hollywood hostel, takes the bus to the beach, where he meets Ross (Chad Allen), a stoner who hangs out at the beach and introduces Jerome to someone who gets him an audition for a commercial.  In the interim, Jerome befriends a tranny prostitute and, through her, meets an older, bitter drag queen who lets him stay in a room at her big house in Silverlake.  Jerome samples the gay nightlife, plays at a sex club, has countless flashbacks imagining his ex Gilles is with him, and gets very disillusioned with the prospects of staying in the States.The film shows the gritty side of Los Angeles and West Hollywood, and I give it credit for being brutally honest in showing how Americans are often not welcoming of people from foreign countries.  I'm guessing the filmmaker was going for a ""Wizard of Oz"" effect in having the film change from Black&White; to Color when he left Paris, but the film was poorly edited throughout, in my opinion. I thought the characters were poorly developed and came across rather bland, especially Debets' deadpan, emotionless delivery.  Chad Allen is wasted in his role, but Michael Airington steals a few scenes as Jerome's drag queen landlady ""Norma Desire."" Unrated, but would likely be at least a heavy R for full frontal nudity and simulated sex. DVD extras include commentary, a brief featurette and a few short deleted scenes.  I give the film three stars out of five.",3,Disappoiinting bland effort shows foreign visitor's view of Hollywood,1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,1656,"['Smarting', 'hurtful', 'breakup', 'twinkish', 'lover', '29', 'year', 'old', 'Parisian', 'Jerome', 'Eric', 'Debets', 'change', 'scenery', 'needed', 'pursue', 'dream', 'going', 'Hollywood', 'try', 'become', 'actor', 'room', 'seedy', 'Hollywood', 'hostel', 'bus', 'beach', 'where', 'Ross', 'Chad', 'Allen', 'stoner', 'who', 'out', 'beach', 'Jerome', 'someone', 'who', 'audition', 'commercial', 'interim', 'Jerome', 'tranny', 'prostitute', 'older', 'bitter', 'drag', 'queen', 'who', 'stay', 'room', 'big', 'house', 'Silverlake', 'Jerome', 'gay', 'nightlife', 'sex', 'club', 'countless', 'flashbacks', 'imagining', 'ex', 'Gilles', 'very', 'disillusioned', 'prospects', 'staying', 'States.The', 'film', 'gritty', 'side', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'give', 'credit', 'being', 'brutally', 'honest', 'showing', 'how', 'Americans', 'are', 'often', 'not', 'welcoming', 'people', 'foreign', 'countries', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'going', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'effect', 'having', 'film', 'change', 'Black', 'White', 'Color', 'when', 'left', 'Paris', 'film', 'was', 'poorly', 'edited', 'opinion', 'thought', 'characters', 'were', 'poorly', 'developed', 'came', 'rather', 'bland', 'especially', 'Debets', 'deadpan', 'emotionless', 'delivery', 'Chad', 'Allen', 'wasted', 'role', 'Michael', 'Airington', 'few', 'scenes', 'Jerome', 'drag', 'queen', 'landlady', 'Norma', 'Desire', 'Unrated', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'least', 'heavy', 'R', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'simulated', 'sex', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'brief', 'featurette', 'few', 'short', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'five']",Hollywood Je T'aime

The ""Donald Strachey"" detective mysteries, (any of the four), or even ""SAVE ME"".  These allow him to command the screen with a presence that is not unlike a young James Gagney!

There are some lovely unsubtle stylistic twists, like using black and white for the 'in France' shots and seeing everything Californian in glorious Technicolour.This is not a full on gay film with regular bedroom trysts and the like. It is about the experience of a disgruntled with life gay Frenchman who goes to Hollywood to become an actor. There are some lovely scenarios and some excellent acting. The plot is a bit weak but the sub strata keeps the momentum up. The main character comes across as being too french at times which is fine cos he is, most of the interest comes with the supporting cast of misfits and lifes failures who keep managing to bring sparkle and hope to the world. I wont ruin the plot by saying what happens, just say it does have a bit of a feel good factor going on. Whilst it plays up on the humour, this is not a comedy; it is much more a study of realtionships in a gently, unfolding manner.
