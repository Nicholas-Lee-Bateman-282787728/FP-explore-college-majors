If they did, it would get a lot more attention because it's simply entertaining.The DVD has been out-of-print for quite awhile and expensive to get.The 80-some minute story moves along very fast and has good characters. Robin Riker, as ""Denise Gore,"" has a great face and - at least for me - alone is worth seeing the film. The same goes for Amy Dolenz, who is a lot of fun as ""Wendy."" Alan Thicke amazed me with his violin talents.The only bad part is the special-effects, which are poor considering the year this was made (1993) but it is still a very good B-movie that should appeal to kids and adults. I read someplace were adults wouldn't like this, but I'm up in age and I really enjoyed it. However, I wouldn't have little kids seeing this, though.I hope this comes back on DVD because I'd like to see it again. I also wish I had a babysitter in my youth that looked like this!",4,An Entertaining B-movie,1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,973,"['was', 'pretty', 'good', 'little', 'horror-comedy', 'film', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'about', 'did', 'would', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'attention', 'simply', 'entertaining.The', 'DVD', 'been', 'out-of-print', 'quite', 'awhile', 'expensive', 'get.The', '80-some', 'minute', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'very', 'fast', 'good', 'characters', 'Robin', 'Riker', 'Denise', 'Gore', 'great', 'face', 'least', 'alone', 'worth', 'seeing', 'film', 'same', 'Amy', 'Dolenz', 'who', 'lot', 'fun', 'Wendy', 'Alan', 'Thicke', 'amazed', 'violin', 'only', 'bad', 'part', 'special-effects', 'are', 'poor', 'considering', 'year', 'was', 'made', '1993', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'B-movie', 'should', 'appeal', 'kids', 'adults', 'read', 'someplace', 'were', 'adults', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', ""'m"", 'up', 'age', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'However', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'little', 'kids', 'seeing', 'hope', 'back', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'again', 'also', 'wish', 'had', 'babysitter', 'youth', 'looked']",N/A

325713,A146QCGOQPZLTG,6302646243,Nicole,"[3, 4]","I enjoyed watching this movie when it first came on the Disney Channel and I still enjoy watching it today. Alan Thicke gives a great performance as Todd's uptight father, a man who is so grounded in reality he doesn't even know what it means to use his imagination. Robin Riker is fabulous as the seductive and evil Denise Gore, who in reality of course is a monster. It was nice seeing Corey Feldman in this movie, who is so hilarious as Phlegm, the rock musician, head banging freak, and Amy Dolenz is equally good as Wendy, Phlegm's girlfriend and Todd's object of affection. I thought that the makeup and the special effects in this movie were actually quite good, the acting was very believable and there were some very funny moments in it. Also look for other great performances by John Astin as the priest and George Gaynes as Todd's grandfather. A wonderful movie, one that the whole family should watch.",5,Beware of the terrible Tropopkin,1052784000,"05 13, 2003",2003,913,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'still', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'today', 'Alan', 'Thicke', 'great', 'performance', 'Todd', 'uptight', 'father', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'grounded', 'reality', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'use', 'imagination', 'Robin', 'Riker', 'fabulous', 'seductive', 'evil', 'Denise', 'Gore', 'who', 'reality', 'course', 'monster', 'was', 'nice', 'seeing', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'movie', 'who', 'so', 'hilarious', 'Phlegm', 'rock', 'musician', 'head', 'banging', 'freak', 'Amy', 'Dolenz', 'equally', 'good', 'Wendy', 'Phlegm', 'girlfriend', 'Todd', 'object', 'affection', 'thought', 'makeup', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'were', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'were', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'Also', 'look', 'other', 'great', 'performances', 'John', 'Astin', 'priest', 'George', 'Gaynes', 'Todd', 'grandfather', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'one', 'whole', 'family', 'should', 'watch']",N/A
