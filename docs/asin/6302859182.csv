This movie is about a group of friends who just happen to be bikers. Bikers are usually given a bad rap, but this movie rebukes all of that. The story is about 2 friends who travel the country on their bikes. One of their friends has a bad accident, brought on by the city that want his land. So his 2 friends Bone & Bear come to his aid to fight the corrupt township. This movie is about friendship & good vs bad. This movie is a must see & is a collectors item so get it before they're gone for good. I have been waiting for 2 months for it to come back in stock, so this may be the last time this movie is printed. The producers are an old couple named the Sebastians so they may not produce any more of these. When I saw it was back in stock a couple of days ago on Amazon I immediately put my order in. Don't wait! Get your copy of this today. It is a serious, funny & action movie with a love story in the midst of the plot of the movie. If you are a biker or not, you'll like this movie.",5,Excellent Movie,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,1122,"['Ihad', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'vhs', 'wore', 'am', 'thrilled', 'have', 'dvd', 'will', 'last', 'rest', 'life', 'movie', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'bikers', 'Bikers', 'are', 'usually', 'given', 'bad', 'rap', 'movie', 'story', '2', 'friends', 'who', 'travel', 'country', 'bikes', 'One', 'friends', 'bad', 'accident', 'brought', 'city', 'want', 'land', '2', 'friends', 'Bone', 'Bear', 'come', 'aid', 'fight', 'corrupt', 'township', 'movie', 'friendship', 'good', 'vs', 'bad', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'collectors', 'item', 'so', 'get', ""'re"", 'gone', 'good', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', '2', 'months', 'come', 'back', 'stock', 'may', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'movie', 'printed', 'producers', 'are', 'old', 'couple', 'named', 'Sebastians', 'may', 'not', 'produce', 'more', 'When', 'saw', 'was', 'back', 'stock', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'Amazon', 'immediately', 'put', 'order', 'Do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Get', 'copy', 'today', 'serious', 'funny', 'action', 'movie', 'love', 'story', 'midst', 'plot', 'movie', 'are', 'biker', 'not', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie']",N/A

I loved this movie not only did it show a different side to being in a biker gang it also showed they had heart. Andrew Divoff, was a believable leader and not to mention good looking in all that biker gear. They're a family no matter what chapter you hail from when one biker is in trouble, everyone lends a hand to help. Also the love story that happens in the middle of this is the added bonus. Action, adventure, comedy, romance and TONS of bikes. For any motorcycle lover, it's a must watch!

Pfeifer ""Wolfgang""","[0, 0]","I don't remember where I first saw this movie, but I enjoyed it, the bikes, and how it breaks the stereotype of bikers being all bad.  They show the wet T-shirt contest at the start of the movie so they can show bare breasts and get their R-rating, but after that, it is nudity free for anyone worried about watching it with their kids.  The villain was one of those types that keeps getting his butt kicked and doesn't take the hint, but I think he finally did in the end.  The only issue I have with the movie is the main theme, that being how Bone and Bear go down to help Ironbutt raise money for his property taxes.  The put on a big bike run and loads of people come and they raise the funds.  The problem is that during the story line where Bone and the local girl are getting to know each other, some of the guys give her what looks to be a Fatboy Trike.  If they had just sold that one bike, the could have more than paid for the taxes.  Of course, that would deflate the story with no need for the run so I understand why they didn't think of that.  Wish this would come out on DVD.  I had to digitize my old VHS copy and it is watchable, but no where the quality I would like.",4,Pleasantly Suprised,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,1187,"['do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'where', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'bikes', 'how', 'stereotype', 'bikers', 'being', 'bad', 'show', 'wet', 'T-shirt', 'contest', 'start', 'movie', 'can', 'show', 'bare', 'breasts', 'get', 'R-rating', 'nudity', 'free', 'anyone', 'worried', 'watching', 'kids', 'villain', 'was', 'one', 'types', 'getting', 'butt', 'kicked', ""n't"", 'take', 'hint', 'think', 'finally', 'did', 'end', 'only', 'issue', 'have', 'movie', 'main', 'theme', 'being', 'how', 'Bone', 'Bear', 'go', 'down', 'help', 'Ironbutt', 'raise', 'money', 'property', 'taxes', 'put', 'big', 'bike', 'run', 'loads', 'people', 'come', 'raise', 'funds', 'problem', 'story', 'line', 'where', 'Bone', 'local', 'girl', 'are', 'getting', 'know', 'other', 'guys', 'give', 'what', 'be', 'Fatboy', 'Trike', 'had', 'just', 'sold', 'one', 'bike', 'could', 'have', 'more', 'paid', 'taxes', 'course', 'would', 'deflate', 'story', 'need', 'run', 'so', 'understand', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Wish', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'had', 'digitize', 'old', 'VHS', 'copy', 'watchable', 'where', 'quality', 'would', 'like']",N/A
