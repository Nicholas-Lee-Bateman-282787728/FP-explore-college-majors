1322929,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0034G4P1C,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 6]","What annoys me inutterably about ""Lottery Ticket"" is that it's actually trying to send a message, namely that greed, with all due respect to Gordon Gecko, is not good. As I sat in the theater, listening to the high school kids sitting behind me endlessly tittering (and making the occasional unnecessary comment), I wondered who amongst the filmmakers actually believed a message would get through to anyone. This is not a movie that puts an effort into making a point; all it does it bombard you with low-grade humor, most of which is wasted on tiresome black stereotypes that weren't all that funny to begin with. It doesn't help that the movie is bipolar, broad and goofy one moment and deadly serious the next; the two tones fit together so awkwardly, it's as if elements were literally cut and pasted from an entirely different screenplay.The plot involves Kevin Carson (Bow Wow), an eighteen-year-old high school graduate from the projects of Atlanta. Despite his dreams of becoming a shoe designer, finances and family prevent him from escaping the world he grew up in. Lottery fever hits his neighborhood during the Fourth of July weekend, the jackpot now at a whopping $370 million; despite his misgivings about the lottery, he plays the numbers printed on the back of a fortune cookie strip, and miraculously wins. Word spreads quickly, despite the fact that the ticket office is closed and won't reopen until the fifth. The neighborhood flocks to his home. People who had previously ignored him now shower him with attention. In due time, he finds himself in debt to the neighborhood godfather (Keith David) and on the hit list of an ex-con (Gbenga Akinnagbe), who wants revenge.How did he get involved with the godfather, nicknamed Sweet Tee? Somehow or another, it connects to the neighborhood hottie, Nikki (Teairra Mari), who is apparently from the projects yet claims to have dated famous men and dresses as if she can afford to live somewhere else; in an effort to show her a good time, Sweet Tee loans Kevin $100,000, which, of course, he spends in one fell swoop. Silliness soon gives way to bad taste when Nikki reveals that she wants to be Kevin's baby mama; not only is this not funny, it's also offensive. So too is a scene in an upscale restaurant, when Kevin's self appointed ""entourage"" - a motley crew of overblown caricatures - make spectacles of themselves in front of the white guests, talking loudly and stealing the silverware. In any other movie, a scene like this would be insulting.Virtually every character is a badly developed typecast. Kevin's grandmother (Loretta Devine) is a boisterous Jesus freak who apparently has dreams about lottery numbers. His best friend, Benny (Brandon T. Jackson), is nothing more or less than comedy relief, which is a clumsy fit for the inevitable confrontation between the two. The local reverend (Mike Epps) would under different circumstances be a televangelist. As he stands in front of his faithful congregation, a Powerpoint presentation compares what he has with what he wants to have, such as a bigger church, a mansion, and a young and hot wife. All of this, he says, can be made possible if Kevin makes a generous donation. What I find so objectionable is that he has a congregation at all; no self-respecting Christian would ever take this man seriously.Interwoven with this is a developing romance between Kevin and his long-time friend, Stacie (Naturi Naughton), who may not be as pretty as girls like Nikki but is at least honest, decent, and insightful. A character of such high standards has no business in a movie like this, but more to the point, the romance is about as contrived and predictable as that of your average romantic comedy. It seems she was included only out of necessity for a female lead. She's a plot device, and nothing more.The same can be said for a reclusive former boxer (Ice Cube), who lives in the basement of the complex and hasn't left his apartment in over twenty years. Why? He claims it's because the neighborhood is a haven for drugs and violence, although we don't really see any of that, so it's kind of hard to take his word for it, and I don't care how much he hears from the vent in his living room. Because he has been hidden away, rumors circulate that he's a serial killer. Whenever he wants food or supplies - say a cherry Coke and some beef jerky - he reaches through the basement window, hands Kevin some money, and asks him to go get them. Does this seem a bit implausible to you? It doesn't matter; his real function is to be a wise elder to Kevin, a convenient way to teach lessons and give advice.I know of a far better film about the ups and downs of winning the lottery. It's called ""It Could Happen to You."" It stars Nicholas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez. Do yourself a tremendous favor and rent that movie instead of going to see ""Lottery Ticket."" It's not funny. It's not meaningful. It sends a message the target audience is not likely to take to heart or even hear, begging the question of why it was brought up in the first place. It doesn't know whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama, and because of that, there are moments when it goes too far in both directions. I'm no expert in calculating odds, but I suspect you have a better chance of winning the lottery than of enjoying anything this movie has to offer.",2,The Odds Are Not in Your Favor,1282867200,"08 27,

I couldn't quite figure out what it was, so I watched for a minute. Well, a minute turned into hours because this movie actually had me wanting to see what was going to happen next, and that's kind of rare these days with movies.The main character Kevin (played by Bow Wow) is a good hearted guy, who works at Foot Locker and lives in the projects with his best friend Benny, Stacie, his grandma (Loretta Divine) and many others. The movie takes you through a journey of Kevin's day to day life, living from paycheck to paycheck, having to dodge a guy who just got out of jail, getting majorly dissed by the girl he had a serious crush on, being wrongly labeled as a snitch by his whole neighborhood, etc. Well all that quickly changed the day Kevin found out he'd hit the 370 million dollar lottery. Then some of those same people who bullied or dissed Kevin were chasing him around trying to tag on to him now. The major wrench in Kevin's win is that he has to wait to get the money but everyone already knows it's coming. There are people after him to steal the ticket, and he and Benny's friendship even gets tested at one point in a very dramatic scene. For people who choose to skip over Lottery Ticket because they think they already know what it's going to be before they see it, I suggest you actually check it out for yourself and see what all the fuss is about.",5,Bow Wow proves that he can be a convincing actor,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,1491,"['was', 'flipping', 'channels', 'one', 'day', 'briefly', 'stopped', 'when', 'saw', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'watched', 'minute', 'Well', 'minute', 'turned', 'hours', 'movie', 'actually', 'had', 'wanting', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'kind', 'rare', 'days', 'movies.The', 'main', 'character', 'Kevin', 'played', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'good', 'hearted', 'guy', 'who', 'Foot', 'Locker', 'projects', 'best', 'friend', 'Benny', 'Stacie', 'grandma', 'Loretta', 'Divine', 'many', 'others', 'movie', 'journey', 'Kevin', 'day', 'day', 'life', 'living', 'paycheck', 'paycheck', 'having', 'dodge', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'jail', 'getting', 'majorly', 'dissed', 'girl', 'had', 'serious', 'crush', 'being', 'wrongly', 'labeled', 'snitch', 'whole', 'neighborhood', 'etc', 'Well', 'quickly', 'changed', 'day', 'Kevin', 'found', ""'d"", 'hit', '370', 'million', 'dollar', 'lottery', 'Then', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'bullied', 'dissed', 'Kevin', 'were', 'chasing', 'around', 'trying', 'tag', 'now', 'major', 'wrench', 'Kevin', 'win', 'wait', 'get', 'money', 'everyone', 'already', 'coming', 'are', 'people', 'steal', 'ticket', 'Benny', 'friendship', 'even', 'tested', 'one', 'point', 'very', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'people', 'who', 'choose', 'skip', 'over', 'Lottery', 'Ticket', 'think', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'be', 'see', 'suggest', 'actually', 'check', 'out', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'about']",N/A

And it was a very silly movie, but I am getting ahead of myself.""Lottery Ticket"" stars an all grown up Bow Wow as Kevin, a recent high school grad who lives in the hood and works at Foot Locker, but has dreams of designing kicks of his own someday instead of selling them. He is a very talented shoe designer, but sees no way out of the life that he now leads. His two best friends are Benny (played by Brandon T. Jackson from Detroit) and Stacie (played by Nautui Naughton). Stacie is on her way to college on a scholarship, but Kevin and Benny are just hanging around the projects, hoping that something good will happen to them.Kevin lives with his grandmother (played by Lorrette Devine). Grandma likes to play the lottery and she has had a dream that Jesus came to her riding in a bus and gave her the numbers to win the lottery, which is now totalling over $300 million dollars.  Everyone in the neighborhood is playing the lottery and dreaming of what they would do with the money, except for Kevin who believes the lottery is just a way to give poor people false dreams.One day, Kevin has a bad run in with a very violent neighborhood thug, which causes Kevin to be fired from his job. As Kevin is contemplating what other bad things will happen to him, he gets a fortune cookie that will changes his life.  The cookie contains lucky numbers and Kevin decides to play the numbers despite his dislike for the lottery - and he wins! The rest of the movie is about how money changes not only Kevin, but also everyone else around him as everyone tries to get their fair share of the lottery pie.This movie is overall very silly. There are lots of jokes and slapstick comedy. It reminded me a lot of the 1980's TV show ""What's Happening"" - if you are old enough to remember. There is also a fair share of foul language and a few suggestive scenes which helped to earn the movie a PG-13 rating. But overall, this silly movie made me laugh out loud more than a few times. The funniest scene was with comedian Mike Epps, who plays Kevin's pastor, Rev. Taylor. The good reverend lets the entire congregation know of God's ""money dreams"" for him with a crazy slide show during the morning worship. He also shows that even in the House of God, a minister needs to pack some heat and have it cocked.I think Bow Wow should be looking for better roles than the one he has in this movie.

What makes it very funny is the way that it exaggerates all of the responses from everyone that comes in contact with Kevin, the lucky guy who defied the odds of 1 in 175 million to get all the winning numbers to win a lottery jackpot of $370 million.Initially when he realises that he has won, he and his grandmother go into a frenzie that is simply crazy and totally hilarious. Next his best friend gets the news, its another wacky scene.As the story goes along, in spite of trying to keep his good fortunes a secret, soon everyone in his 'hood is in his house seeking a piece of the action, and a mad on foot chase scene unfolds. You really need to see this... its a belly full of laughs. Additionally overnight Kevin's fortunes change also with a lady (Nikki) that he was admiring.But, there is also a very serious side with this film. Kevin gets involved with a thug/bully and a mobster that suddenly get an acute interest in him and his newly acquired fortunes. So, although this film has some very funny parts, it also shows the pitfalls that those that might acquire wealth suddenly can fall into.Notes:[1] There is also some irreverent humor as a Pastor zooms in on Kevin in order to lock in on some of his funds as well.[2] Rating: PG - but still contains strong language.",4,Fickle For Finances,1289174400,"11 8, 2010",2010,1304,"['Film', 'blast', 'What', 'very', 'funny', 'way', 'responses', 'everyone', 'contact', 'Kevin', 'lucky', 'guy', 'who', 'defied', 'odds', '1', '175', 'million', 'get', 'winning', 'numbers', 'win', 'lottery', 'jackpot', '370', 'million.Initially', 'when', 'won', 'grandmother', 'go', 'frenzie', 'simply', 'crazy', 'totally', 'hilarious', 'Next', 'best', 'friend', 'news', 'wacky', 'scene.As', 'story', 'along', 'spite', 'trying', 'keep', 'good', 'fortunes', 'secret', 'soon', 'everyone', ""'hood"", 'house', 'seeking', 'piece', 'action', 'mad', 'foot', 'chase', 'scene', 'unfolds', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'belly', 'full', 'laughs', 'Additionally', 'overnight', 'Kevin', 'fortunes', 'change', 'also', 'lady', 'Nikki', 'was', 'admiring.But', 'also', 'very', 'serious', 'side', 'film', 'Kevin', 'involved', 'thug/bully', 'mobster', 'suddenly', 'get', 'acute', 'interest', 'newly', 'acquired', 'fortunes', 'So', 'film', 'very', 'funny', 'parts', 'also', 'pitfalls', 'might', 'acquire', 'wealth', 'suddenly', 'can', 'fall', 'into.Notes', '1', ']', 'also', 'irreverent', 'humor', 'Pastor', 'zooms', 'Kevin', 'order', 'lock', 'funds', 'as', 'well', '[', '2', ']', 'Rating', 'PG', 'still', 'strong', 'language']",N/A

Nothing more.  Nothing less.  All political correctness should go out the door when it comes to viewing a comedy film.  Secondly, this film delivers on what it's advertised to be.  A comedy.  Yes, this movie does ask the question of what would you do if you won the lottery.  The character in this film does, indeed, make the choice that will not only benefit himself, but, also others.  I, for one, loved the film and would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a true comedic film.  Much props to Bow Wow (whose acting does seem to get a little better with each film), Ice Cube, Mike Epps, Brandon T. Jackson (who had everyone laughing their guts out), Charlie Murphy, and everyone else involved in this film.  Also, notice how I didn't go deep into the plot of the story.  Many of you can read that in the description box.  I, for one, am tired of reading these ""reviews"" that go so deep into the plot description that it literally repeats what is written in the product description.
