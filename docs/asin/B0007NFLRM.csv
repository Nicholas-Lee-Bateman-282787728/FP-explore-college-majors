883792,A1CHOHPV418P15,B0007NFLRM,Boys' Mom,"[2, 2]","My son, who is now 2 years old, began watching this when he was 15 months old.  At first, it was a hard sell -- I think because the opening number threw him for a loop.  He was used to Baby Einstein with classical music; and this video has lyrics.  So, I put it in the car DVD player so he was forced to watch it.  After a while, he began to love it.  Some of the music sounds somewhat like gospel.  It's a bit peculiar compared with other kids DVD's; but we've grown to like it alot.  He particularly likes the segment where the puppets are shown driving construction equipment - i.e. bulldozer, dump truck, etc.  Then there is a great song -- ""dig, dig, dig, my excavator!"" and kids are seen pushing toy dump trucks around.  There is also a segment showing tools - hammer, saw, etc.  While I think girls would like it, I think it's a must for boys.  I wish there were more boys videos for toddlers on the market - i.e. cars, construction, trucks, etc.",5,stands apart from others,1190505600,"09 23, 2007",2007,953,"['son', 'who', 'now', '2', 'years', 'old', 'began', 'watching', 'when', 'was', '15', 'months', 'old', 'first', 'was', 'hard', 'sell', 'think', 'opening', 'number', 'threw', 'loop', 'was', 'used', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'classical', 'music', 'video', 'lyrics', 'So', 'put', 'car', 'DVD', 'player', 'so', 'was', 'forced', 'watch', 'while', 'began', 'love', 'music', 'somewhat', 'like', 'gospel', 'bit', 'peculiar', 'compared', 'other', 'kids', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'like', 'alot', 'particularly', 'segment', 'where', 'puppets', 'are', 'shown', 'driving', 'construction', 'equipment', 'i.e', 'bulldozer', 'dump', 'truck', 'etc', 'Then', 'great', 'song', 'dig', 'dig', 'dig', 'excavator', 'kids', 'are', 'seen', 'pushing', 'toy', 'dump', 'trucks', 'also', 'segment', 'showing', 'tools', 'hammer', 'saw', 'etc', 'think', 'girls', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'must', 'boys', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'boys', 'videos', 'toddlers', 'market', 'i.e', 'cars', 'construction', 'trucks', 'etc']",N/A
883793,APKZ02752JSXB,B0007NFLRM,"Dr. B ""Wisecracker""","[0, 0]","I just love this DVD! Whoever designed it has a great sense of what kids find funny, and how long they can attend to any one scene. This actually comes close to the formula of Sesame Street, as it contains lots of repetition across different scenarios. The songs are great, with rock, gospel, and blues numbers--don't we get tired of the idea that we have to emphasize only classical to our little 'einsteins'? My 13 month old loves the puppets, and is starting to get the idea of the different construction machines. The whole thing emphasizes that building is for all types of kids, boys AND girls, with a heaping dose of teamwork and 'keep trying' messages. Can't recommend this one highly enough.",5,Smarter than the average kid DVD,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,700,"['just', 'love', 'DVD', 'Whoever', 'designed', 'great', 'sense', 'what', 'kids', 'find', 'funny', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'attend', 'one', 'scene', 'actually', 'close', 'formula', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'lots', 'repetition', 'different', 'scenarios', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'rock', 'gospel', 'numbers', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'tired', 'idea', 'have', 'emphasize', 'only', 'classical', 'little', ""'einsteins"", '13', 'month', 'old', 'puppets', 'starting', 'get', 'idea', 'different', 'construction', 'machines', 'whole', 'thing', 'building', 'types', 'kids', 'boys', 'girls', 'heaping', 'dose', 'teamwork', ""'keep"", 'trying', 'messages', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'one', 'highly', 'enough']",N/A
