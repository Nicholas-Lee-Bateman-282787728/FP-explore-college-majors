Just as those movies stunk, so does this one.  This movie could have been called ""The Look-alike Film.""  The main character looked like he could have been Brendan Fraser's fatter brother.  The Spanish student was obviously a Penelope Cruz imitation.  In fairness, one guy may have been the actual tattooed guy from ""Oz,"" the one on death row.This film says it has ""sexual content,"" but it could have run on non-cable TV.  There is no nudity whatsoever.  The plot is predictable.  I am in shock that a movie whose cover looked so titillating could be such a disappointment.  This work really and truly lacked redeeming qualities.",1,UNoriginal!!!,1163203200,"11 11, 2006",2006,762,"['straight', 'guy', 'who', 'have', 'female-dominant', 'threesome', 'Let', 'see', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'Trois', 'Just', 'One', 'Time', 'Just', 'movies', 'stunk', 'so', 'one', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Look-alike', 'Film', 'main', 'character', 'looked', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'fatter', 'brother', 'Spanish', 'student', 'was', 'obviously', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'imitation', 'fairness', 'one', 'guy', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'actual', 'tattooed', 'guy', 'Oz', 'one', 'death', 'row.This', 'film', 'sexual', 'content', 'could', 'have', 'run', 'non-cable', 'TV', 'nudity', 'whatsoever', 'plot', 'predictable', 'am', 'shock', 'movie', 'cover', 'looked', 'so', 'titillating', 'could', 'be', 'such', 'disappointment', 'work', 'really', 'truly', 'lacked', 'redeeming', 'qualities']",N/A
