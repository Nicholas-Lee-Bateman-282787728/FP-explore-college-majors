I was a big fan of the CKY videos which were around before the MTV Jackass. I have been a fan for 10+ years and to this very day still cry from laughing so hard. I love this movie and recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the show. It also bitter sweet to see Ryan Dunn who recently passed away. Watching Jackass 3.5 makes it easier to deal with.

1421282,A1XDMYX8QOW07N,B004NNV5MM,Geoffrey Kleinman,"[4, 5]","After watching Jackass 3.5 you understand why the Jackass crew shoots so many bits and then cherry picks the best to be in their movies.  Jackass 3.5 is a collection of bits that either didn't fit into Jackass 3 or just didn't really come off well.  There are some great moments in Jackass 3.5, and the scenes with Steve-O are slightly stronger here than in the original film, but all in all these scenes feel like ""also rans"".Jackass 3.5 could have easily been included in a Special Jackass 3 DVD/Blu-Ray release, and on its own it isn't nearly as strong as the other Jackass movies.  Still it gives a nice glimpse into the process of what makes Jackass, Jackass and even with the scenes where everything doesn't go right, it's still fun to watch the Jackass crew do their thing.If you haven't seen Jackass 3, be sure to see it before you see Jackass 3.5, it's a much better movie and you'll get a lot more out of 3.5 if you've seen 3 first.Otherwise, Jackass 3.5 is a proverbial rental.

The Jackass crew has always been hesitant to do commentaries it seems, most obviously due to their constant in-fighting and general partying ways not mixing well with sitting in a small studio watching their own movie and trying to be clever.  3.5 fixes this to some extent by having commentary in the way of in-movie interviews, much like 2.5 and the making of films.

They seem like a bunch of crazy, drunken idiots, but they actually plan and put a lot of work into each and every stunt. What I like about 3.5 is that for the first time, they really show you what's going on behind the scenes. They show you what it's like to be on the set and what goes into the things they do, with in depth interviews, and behind the scenes footage. They also start to go into a different direction, going from the usual stunts and gross outs to pranks and practical jokes, which are utterly hilarious.
