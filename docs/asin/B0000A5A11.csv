761737,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B0000A5A11,Addicted2Amazon!,"[6, 6]","...And as that is the limit of my middle school French, the rest of this review will have to be in English!  ;-)""The Feast of All Saints"" is a very solid adaptation of the novel of the same name, by Anne Rice.  I was already a huge fan of Ms. Rice's Vampire Chronicles and Mayfair Witches novels when I discovered TFOAS.  As a young ""Yankee"" African-American girl, I was immediately surprised and fascinated by the discovery of the 'gens de couleur libres,' or 'free people of color,' a large, prosperous Creole population descended from the French and their African slaves in antebellum New Orleans.  Though it took me a few tries to make it all the way through the heavy book (I was about 12 when I first tried), I ultimately fell in love not only with Ms. Rice's gorgeous prose, but the strange, privledged, oppressed, beautiful and tragic world of the gens de couleur libres.  I would now rate this novel as one of my top 5 favorites books ever.TFOAS takes place in 1840s New Orleans and primarily centers around the teenaged Marcel Ste. Marie, the son of a wealthy French planter and his elegant Creole mistress of African and French descent.  Though clearly illegitimate, Marcel and his sister are provided for very generously by their father.  In fact, Marcel is very dependent on this man for everything and believes that he is entitled, particularly to the Holy Grail of well-to-do American men of color: a Paris education, which he dreams of day and night.  In Paris, a Negro man is just a man, with no racist laws or crippling prejudices to stop him from seizing the world.This story tells of Marcel's coming-of-age, what he is taught of the world as a child of priviledge, and what he (often painfully) learns as Truth as the blinders of wealth and entitlement are slowly ripped away.The whole film is beautifully done.  The costumes and hair alone are DAZZLING!!  It is all very historically accurate and really transports you to 1820s and 1840s New Orleans and its countryside.  It's true that for a Showtime presentation, it may now be considered a bit sub par.  This is most evident in the opening battle scene that depicts the Haitian Revolution of 1804. Though it is pretty impressive, it seems a little cartoonish compared to what Showtime can now do. Production values have come a long, long way since then!The actors are wonderful.  The casting in this film is amazing!  As far as big names go, we have Ben Vereen, Peter Gallagher, Gloria Reuben, Jasmine Guy, Eartha Kitt, Forest Whitaker, Jennifer Beals, Ruby Dee, James Earl Jones and the incomparable Ossie Davis, just for starters! The younger actor and actresses also do well.  Yes, some are better than others.  This film also uses accents, and, well, some actors do their accent well, some absolutely nail it, and others are pretty terrible.  But hey kudos to all of them for trying, especially the younger ones.Robert Ri'chard was wonderful in the role of Marcel. Not only was he exactly a physical manifestation of what I imagined him to be (honey skin, blue eyes, African-textured blond hair) but he did a very good job of expressing Marcel's exuberance, moodiness and intellectual curiosity.Bianca Lawson was also wonderful in the role of Annabella Monroe.  She is a beautiful actress who did a great job at expressing Annabella's sensible, sweet, down-to-earth nature as well as her quiet, dignified strength and defiance against society's expectation of her.Though I enjoyed Daniel Sunjata's depiction of Christophe Mercier (Daniel is absolutely gorgeous to look at..that helps!), I didn't think it was complete.  This is most likely the fault of the writers, but on film we get plenty of Christophe's intellectual,gentleman-to-his-fingertips image, but we do not get to see the darker, slightly unhinged, non-conformist side to Christophe's nature that was so evident in the novel.  Christophe was very much a part of the gens de couleur society, but at the same time he saw through the facade and was equally depressed and amused by what he saw.  We don't really see this in the film, unfortunately.Gloria Reuben was great as Marcel's mother, the beautiful yet internally ugly Cecile Ste. Marie.  As her carefully crafted financial support starts to unravel, Ms. Reuben does a great job at expressing Cecile's self-righteous anger and selfish sacrifice of her own children's happiness.And the late, great Ossie Davis IS Jean Jacques.  It is such a thrill to see this fine actor perform.  Mr. Davis's character has a small but a very important role, describing his 1st person account of the Haitian Revolution...and, for the first time, causing young Marcel to question things that he's been told.As an African-American woman, I love to see other women of African descent portrayed beautifully, and this film  is full of dark beauty! The actresses glow in this film, representing all hues from ivory to deep walnut.  They truly do justice to the legendary power of seduction that the free women of color possessed!  :-)As you can tell by my ridiculously long review, I really enjoy this film!  I am so glad it was made!  I would have liked some of my favorite scenes from the novel included in the film (the funeral of Dolly Rose's child; the first conversation of Marcel and Christophe, where Christophe is in a tree and Marcel in a cemetery; the beautiful, mad Juliet Mercier cursing out a carriage driver and hurling her cat into his face!), but it is still a pretty faithful adaptation of an important book, in my mind.Highly recommended!  :-)P.S. Another very enjoyable film about the New Orleans gens de couleur libres is ""The Courage to Love,"" a Lifetime film starring Vanessa Williams, Diahann Carroll and Gil Bellows.  If you enjoy ""The Feast of All Saints,"" you should check this one out as well.",5,J'Adore Ce Film!  :-),1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,5791,"['limit', 'middle', 'school', 'French', 'rest', 'review',

761739,A3KMTOFTUUNFHG,B0000A5A11,Brett D. Cullum,"[16, 16]","Anne Rice has had a troubled history with her books turning into films.  Unrecognizable adaptations of EXIT TO EDEN and QUEEN OF THE DAMNED are more frequent than quality films such as INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE.  Here you have a half and half treatment of a novel that dealt with people who were half black and half white!  Parts of it are true to the novel and its characters, and then parts will leave you scratching your head wondering where they got something.  Anne Rice should step in more often and make sure these things are done right, but alas ... this one is close!Pretty pretty sets, costumes, and actors bring to life a story of racial identity crisis in the South of the 1800s.  New Orleans before the slaves were free had a third race of people who were neither black and slaves nor white and truly free.  They lived on a fringe of society, and had to arrange their lives carefully or pay for the consequences.  Educated bohemians they became the basis for the creoles!It's an oft ignored subject of American history, and a beautiful story told in rich detail.  The book has the luxury of its own pacing, and here the movie has to step quickly to keep up!  So some of this feels rushed.  But they got the right people!  Famous black actors mix with unknowns, and they all come out fine and noble.  Even if the dialogue or pacing does not always seem to be on their side.But worth a look!

761746,A2JNPW2T6ZGZJA,B0000A5A11,"Jerome-Anthony Larkin ""Dedicated Movie Lover""","[2, 2]","The first time I saw this movie, I was spellbound.  It was premiered on Showtime about ten years ago, and the memory of the production remained in my head for years.  And I always vowed I would get a copy of the dvd whenever it was released.  Recently finding out on Amazon.com that it was released, I didn't waste any time ordering my own copy.  I am an avid movie watcher and I am in the process of collecting every movie I love.  I know this arduous task is gonna take years to do, but ""Feast Of All Saints"" is on my personalized ""Favorite Top 400 Movies"" list.  It actually ranks number 10.........after such favorites as ""Driving Miss. Daisy"", ""Mahogany,"" ""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""the Notbeook,"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons"" (in that order). And after seeing ""Feast Of All Saints"" after so many years, I'm beginning to wonder if it shouldn't be higher on my list.Ann Rice did a superb job of telling this unforgettable story.  I have not read the book, but I was totally familiar with her partiality to the Creole lifestyle and language.  I have always enjoyed time-pieces in movies and ""Feast Of All Saints"" ranks right up there with the very best like ""Roots"" and the multi Oscar-nominated ""The Color Purple.""  It's a shame how movies come and go right before our eyes.  As soon as a movie is premiered these days, there are soon locked away on a shelf, especially if it wasn't a hit.  Or even if it were a hit, sometimes the movie is over-exposed and still get lost in the past.  I wish there was a mini-series channel on cable where all the great mini-series could be viewed, just by checking your local listings.  And although I now own the dvd, I would still watch ""Feast Of All Saints"" on the Mini-Series Channel just for the commarderie.The cast of the movie was excellent.  I found it a joy to have the amazing and late Eartha Kitt apart of this ensemble.  I'm pretty sure this was probably one of her last major performances before her death. And I'm sorrowed that we've lost her when she was still a major force and one of the last pioneers of black cinema and Hollywood as a whole.  The film also includes the performing expertise of Oscar-nominee, Rudy Dee, and her late husband, Ossie Davis.  Their paths did not cross in the film.  But just to see them together again for the umpteenth time in a film was a joy also.  It's a shame that Miss. Dee's role was pretty quick and concise. An immediate smile comes to my face whenever she comes on screen.Another one of my favorites was the star himself: Richard Ri'chard. He did an excellent job portraying the innocent, often-times unlearned main character. I could go on about this movie.  There were so many superb moments that are embedded in my heart. Another one of my favorites was Jasmine Guy from the ""A Different World"" comedy series. It was nice seeing her in another genre different from which she made popular.  I've always enjoyed a good drama piece and ""Feast Of All Saints"" does that in a superb way.  Some of the storylines are a little nerving to some who may not be used to strong subject matter.

761752,A2VVOAR8QQIAVS,B0000A5A11,"La Reyna ""La Reyna""","[33, 35]","My take on Anne Rice's Feast of All SaintsA beautiful movie about America's least known group of People in Antebellum Louisiana, Gens de Colour. As a woman of African, American Indian, and White ancestry, I've always been fascinated by those people in New Orleans who formed an aristocracy unto themselves and were free. They have their rituals, customs, and amusements such as the famous Quadroon Balls. They have rights and freedoms that most blacks and multiracials, slave and free, in antebellum America didn't have, yet they were not completely free because the power elite of that time didn't want to share power with the free people of color. They may conduct business with them, but refuse to invite them to their houses for dinner or social function.Anne Rice has done an excellent job telling the story through the eyes of young Marcel, who came of age at 17, was promised by his absentee father an education abroad. However, because of the racism and jealousy of the Ferronaire family as well as the economic troubles at Bontemps, he was denied his lifelong dream of going there to pursue his prestigious education at the Sorbonne. He took matters in his own hands and went to the plantation where his father lives and was forbidden by his father to visit there. It was there where Marcel was brutally whipped and kicked by his own his father, in the presence of his estranged wife and children. What man would abuse his own flesh and blood? It has to be motivated by race and class: Marcel must learn his place in the white world of 19th-Century Louisiana. He learned it the hard way through the denial of privileges his absentee father enjoy as well as his humiliation and abuse by M. Ferronaire. He now learned that he must cast his allegience to people of color, whose lives have been shaped by society's limitations and its racist, classist behavior and ritual. Also, Marcel learned more about slavery, the war in Saint Domingne(Now Haiti), the limitations placed upon free people of color, the slave status of his half sister Lisette, who has the same father as he:  she was the product of a liaison between Ferronaire and Zazu, a very handsome black slave woman from the Ferronaire plantation.  He was upset at his mother for being ignorant of history, for her adopted mother brought her from Saint Domingue during the war of independence from France and like Lisette, a product of a liaison between a rich white planter and a beautiful black slave mother who is unnamed in both novel and film adaptation.His mother's insane devotion to her absentee protector didn't help Marcel's recent problems, yet he must leave his family to live at his schoolteacher's house or else they lose monetary and material support from M. Ferronaire. Humiliated and hurt, Marcel offer himself to him, but Mercier refuses, citing his childish dependency upon others, especially by those whom didn't truly love him. His father was a prime example.The free multiracial women of New Orleans were in a very precarious position. While they were praised for their ""exotic"" beauty, they weren't allow to marry white men. Pernicious class prejudices made it difficult to marry free multiracial men for that meant lower social status. Some of the women chose convent life, but even that is out of the question for most of them. So they settle into a lifestyle of their mothers: That being a well-kept mistress of a white man. Only certain white men qualify. He has to be wealthy, refined, educated, and of the upper class. Those women wouldn't settle for less. Case in point: The argument between Cecile Ste Marie and her daughter over her daughter's position. When Cecile's daughter Marie chose to be married to Monsieur de Lemontant's son, she was very furious at her  choice, for she is expected to follow her mother in the tradition of having a wealthy, refined white man as her protector. She recently lost her lover in death who didn't bother to leave her family any provision in the event of his passing. Marcel's exile in San Souci and her daughter's pursuit of Richard Lemontant didn't help her current financial woes. She summon her long-neglected daughter to discuss about the situation and for her to accept placage, which her daughter consider it another form of slavery in a gilded cage without the benefits of marriage. They had a very heated argument over it that caused her mom to summon her less than respectable friend, Dolly Rose to her house to help Marie to see that her decision of marrying Richard isn't in her mom's best interest. She steadfast held to her position which led to disasterous consequences afterwards.I couldn't forgive Cecile St. Marie for the neglect of her daughter, indifferent to the suffering her son had at the hands of his callous and insensitive father, the brutal rape of her daughter, and the suicide of their half-sister Lisette after the incident at the voodoo brothel. He finally found peace with his people, gens de colour libre at the end of the movie. He decides to become a photographer and to work with the people in his hometown instead of studying abroad. He also found renewed love from Anna Bella Monroe played by Bianca Lawson from ""Save the Last Dance."" Anna Bella emerge as the stronger character in all of this and much more, even with the placage with Aglae's brother and eventual abandonment by him. He didn't left her in poverty, for he left her the house along with all the possessions as well as lifelong monetary support which Philippe didn't do for the Ste. Marie family.I wish Americans know more of this least-known group of people andstop the unnecessary divisions among the human race. America needs to acknowlege their ties to one another, that racial/ethnic category terms such as ""blacks"" and ""whites"" are just artificial social categories design to keep people apart and resentful of one another. We are one people regardless of our various racial and ethnic origins.I recommend this movie to those who want to know the whole truth about American history instead of the doctored version parroted by the media and educational system.",5,My take on this movie,1100736000,"11 18, 2004",2004,6102,"['take', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'Feast', 'All', 'SaintsA', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'America', 'least', 'known',

When I first saw this movie, I could see based on the footage that it was filmed in Canada. The terrain is totally different from south Louisiana. It looked like a movie set. I guess the set designers thought they could put a few stands of fake Spanish moss on the trees and a hunk of it in the fountains and a banana tree in that corner and a palm in the other. It looked like a theme park! The streets looked too clean. For some reason they could not depict the elegance of decay of old New Orleans which to me is paramount in the telling of these people's lives but maybe I am being too technical. All the principle characters  all had straight teeth and clear skin. Back in the 1840's just about everybody had some sort of illness then and they looked it. The actor who played Marcel could not act. The actor who played his white father did not age at all for 18 years. Still looked the same, yet he had very young children by his white wife who he married 18 years before. The architecture of the plantation house was also wrong. It was'nt even FrenchNo live oaks anywhere which are major icons in southern Louisiana.The supporting actors and actresses were quite good.Let me just say this, white men maintaining women of color was not only prevelent in New Orleans but also other states in the south, the difference is is that in New Orleans, the white master would leave them property and money. Not so in other southern states.The more beautiful the woman, the more she would receive from the white man.The placage system in New Orleans was a business arrangement and it worked for both parties.",2,What A Silly Movie!,1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,1696,"['Why', 'production', 'team', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'New', 'Orleans', 'comprehension', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'could', 'see', 'based', 'footage', 'was', 'filmed', 'Canada', 'terrain', 'totally', 'different', 'south', 'Louisiana', 'looked', 'movie', 'set', 'guess', 'set', 'designers', 'thought', 'could', 'put', 'few', 'stands', 'fake', 'Spanish', 'moss', 'trees', 'hunk', 'fountains', 'banana', 'tree', 'corner', 'palm', 'other', 'looked', 'theme', 'park', 'streets', 'looked', 'too', 'clean', 'reason', 'could', 'not', 'depict', 'elegance', 'decay', 'old', 'New', 'Orleans', 'paramount', 'telling', 'people', 'lives', 'maybe', 'am', 'being', 'too', 'technical', 'principle', 'characters', 'had', 'straight', 'teeth', 'clear', 'skin', 'Back', '1840', 'just', 'everybody', 'had', 'sort', 'illness', 'then', 'looked', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Marcel', 'could', 'not', 'act', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'white', 'father', 'did', 'not', 'age', '18', 'years', 'Still', 'looked', 'same', 'yet', 'had', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'white', 'wife', 'who', 'married', '18', 'years', 'before', 'architecture', 'plantation', 'house', 'was', 'also', 'wrong', ""was'nt"", 'even', 'FrenchNo', 'live', 'oaks', 'anywhere', 'are', 'major', 'icons', 'southern', 'Louisiana.The', 'supporting', 'actors', 'actresses', 'were', 'quite', 'good.Let', 'just', 'say', 'white', 'men', 'maintaining', 'women', 'color', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'prevelent', 'New', 'Orleans', 'also', 'other', 'states', 'south', 'difference', 'New', 'Orleans', 'white', 'master', 'would', 'leave', 'property', 'money', 'Not', 'so', 'other', 'southern', 'states.The', 'more', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'more', 'would', 'receive', 'white', 'man.The', 'placage', 'system', 'New', 'Orleans', 'was', 'business', 'arrangement', 'worked', 'parties']",The Feast of All Saints
