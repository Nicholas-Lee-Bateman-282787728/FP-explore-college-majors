As might be expected, I was only able to watch some of the episodes before the picture froze.  I removed the disc, placed it on its hub in the box; it fit snuggly.  It is difficult to imagine how it could have come free on its own.This funny series is about Mr. Riley, who is a good man, loves his family, has some kooky neighbors, and has a knack for getting himself into the silliest of predicaments.  Have you ever thought you knew what was going on, acted upon it, only to find out later, to your embarrassment, that you were completely wrong; his favorite phrase, as he looks into the camera: ""What a revolting development this is!""Overall: if the ratings were just about the shows, it would be a 4 or 5; however, a bad disc warrants a rating of 1.Picture (DVD): 2.5 to 3, a little fuzzy, some defects, slight cropping on left side, and in all episodes ""CINEBX"" appears briefly in the lower right edge of the screen.

This show brings one back to a simpler time when tv was good. It is a shame that programs of today can not keep up with how they did this show. I do like some of the shows of today but these old ones just can not be beat. I find that when you have cable and they give you several hundred channels you still find nearly nothing to watch and then along comes out the dvd's and you get something good to watch. The only thing you would want to add to this is some popcorn and soda pop and the time to enjoy!!,5,life of riley with jackie gleason,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,651,"['enjoy', 'life', 'riley', 'dvd', 'good', 'clean', 'humor', 'grandparents', 'came', 'over', 'watched', 'could', 'very', 'much', 'enjoy', 'show', 'one', 'back', 'simpler', 'time', 'when', 'tv', 'was', 'good', 'shame', 'programs', 'today', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'up', 'how', 'did', 'show', 'do', 'shows', 'today', 'old', 'ones', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'beat', 'find', 'when', 'have', 'cable', 'give', 'several', 'hundred', 'channels', 'still', 'find', 'nearly', 'nothing', 'watch', 'then', 'along', 'out', 'dvd', 'get', 'something', 'good', 'watch', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'want', 'add', 'popcorn', 'soda', 'pop', 'time', 'enjoy']",N/A

Having read I suspect every book written about him I do not ever remember it mentioned that he played in the TV series, &#34;The Life of Riley&#34;. And after watching the Riley DVD's I can see why everybody has shied away from bringing this fact to light. Jackie seems to be going through the motions in this series as if he is just out to draw a paycheck and the acting and script shows him as a small time TV comedian. Unlike the Honeymooners, the strong belly laughs in Riley are non-existent. I will watch once and give the DVD away as I have no desire to watch again. You can see the development of many Gleason actions that will later become honed to become the Ralph Cramden and mark Jackie as the &#34;Great One&#34;, which he truly was.",1,A Jackie Gleason We Do Not Know,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,782,"['am', 'great', 'fan', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'Having', 'read', 'suspect', 'book', 'written', 'do', 'not', 'ever', 'remember', 'mentioned', 'played', 'TV', 'series', '34', 'Life', 'Riley', '34', 'watching', 'Riley', 'DVD', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'everybody', 'shied', 'away', 'bringing', 'fact', 'light', 'Jackie', 'be', 'going', 'motions', 'series', 'just', 'out', 'draw', 'paycheck', 'acting', 'script', 'small', 'time', 'TV', 'comedian', 'Honeymooners', 'strong', 'belly', 'Riley', 'are', 'non-existent', 'will', 'watch', 'once', 'give', 'DVD', 'away', 'have', 'desire', 'watch', 'again', 'can', 'see', 'development', 'many', 'Gleason', 'actions', 'will', 'later', 'become', 'honed', 'become', 'Ralph', 'Cramden', 'mark', 'Jackie', '34', 'Great', 'One', '34', 'truly', 'was']",N/A
