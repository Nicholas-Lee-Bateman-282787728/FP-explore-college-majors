I payed less than nothing for it and the DVD had never been used. This is a great seller and my kids did not move for the entire time the DVD was playing. That makes this tape worth every penny.,5,Get to Know Joe,1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,274,"['arrived', 'time', 'house', 'When', 'came', 'kids', 'were', 'excited', 'payed', 'less', 'nothing', 'DVD', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'used', 'great', 'seller', 'kids', 'did', 'not', 'move', 'entire', 'time', 'DVD', 'was', 'playing', 'tape', 'worth', 'penny']",N/A

We bought this video because it includes those transition episodes. They just love it! It has really helped them enjoy the show, and deal with teh changing of peoplein their lives here, especially therapists. The episodes themselves and the clue games are also particularly nice ones.",5,"Wow, really excellent!",1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,409,"['kids', 'really', 'love', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'often', 'had', 'trouble', 'fact', 'was', 'Joe', 'sometimes', 'was', 'Steve', 'bought', 'video', 'transition', 'episodes', 'just', 'love', 'really', 'helped', 'enjoy', 'show', 'deal', 'teh', 'changing', 'peoplein', 'lives', 'here', 'especially', 'therapists', 'episodes', 'clue', 'games', 'are', 'also', 'particularly', 'nice', 'ones']",N/A

717364,A2MMYN8VLJ63J0,B00006IUJY,"Kristina L. Johnson ""K. Johnson""","[0, 0]","I have recently introduced my young toddler (21 months old) to the old Blue's Clues series that my 13 year old used to love. Well, the little one loves these videos just as much as the older one did and has learned a LOT from them. Very good interactive series for small children. Since I knew my little guy would start seeing ""Joe"" instead of Steve I thought it might be a good idea to buy this DVD so he wouldn't be surprised. Turns out that was a VERY good idea. I thought a 3 episode introduction to Joe was a bit excessive and maybe not necessary, but my little one was actually scared of Joe when he first saw him! I guess at this age they may assume there is a real live-time person inside the TV, and can be shy! When Joe first came on, my toddler would actually cover his eyes and peek around shyly at Joe, it really did require the full 3 episodes for my son to accept ""Joe"" over the Steve he was used to seeing on Blue's Clues.  For a child who isn't in a shy stage, maybe this isn't necessary, but in my case it turned out to be VERY helpful -and it was wise on the part of the Blue's Clues show to be sensitive to young and shy toddlers when introducing Joe. I am sad that the series came to an end, but glad the old episodes are still relevant and appropriate for young toddlers, it is one of the best series out there in my opinion. So far it looks like Joe was a good replacement, and I highly recommend watching the introduction episodes if your child is accustomed to watching the older episodes with Steve.",5,"Wow, Young Toddler Really Needed This Video",1312416000,"08 4, 2011",2011,1525,"['have', 'recently', 'introduced', 'young', 'toddler', '21', 'months', 'old', 'old', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'series', '13', 'year', 'old', 'used', 'love', 'Well', 'little', 'one', 'videos', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'older', 'one', 'did', 'learned', 'LOT', 'Very', 'good', 'interactive', 'series', 'small', 'children', 'knew', 'little', 'guy', 'would', 'start', 'seeing', 'Joe', 'instead', 'Steve', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'buy', 'DVD', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'out', 'was', 'VERY', 'good', 'idea', 'thought', '3', 'episode', 'introduction', 'Joe', 'was', 'bit', 'excessive', 'maybe', 'not', 'necessary', 'little', 'one', 'was', 'actually', 'scared', 'Joe', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'guess', 'age', 'may', 'assume', 'real', 'live-time', 'person', 'TV', 'can', 'be', 'shy', 'When', 'Joe', 'first', 'came', 'toddler', 'would', 'actually', 'cover', 'eyes', 'peek', 'around', 'shyly', 'Joe', 'really', 'did', 'require', 'full', '3', 'episodes', 'son', 'accept', 'Joe', 'Steve', 'was', 'used', 'seeing', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'child', 'who', ""n't"", 'shy', 'stage', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'case', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'VERY', 'helpful', '-and', 'was', 'wise', 'part', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'show', 'be', 'sensitive', 'young', 'shy', 'toddlers', 'when', 'introducing', 'Joe', 'am', 'sad', 'series', 'came', 'end', 'old', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'relevant', 'appropriate', 'young', 'toddlers', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'there', 'opinion', 'So', 'far', 'Joe', 'was', 'good', 'replacement', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'introduction', 'child', 'accustomed', 'watching', 'older', 'episodes', 'Steve']",N/A
