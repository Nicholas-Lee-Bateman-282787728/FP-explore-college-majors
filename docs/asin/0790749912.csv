No. Does it matter? No. Is the total lack of subtlety in Oliver Stone's work appropriate for a football movie? Of course. Damn fine movie. Real. The celebrity life of the pro football player isn't real. That's here, too. Why am I such an obsessed sports fan? I still don't know. But I do know this is a very cool movie. My lovely Australian non-sporty wife found it educational, but not gripping enough to watch all 150 minutes. She stopped at 90. But I think she'll agree with me when I recommend it. It's a good movie, with especially fine performances by Al Pacino (of course) and Jamie Foxx. Plus, many NFL stars for those of us who would notice that sort of thing.",3,Any Given Sunday,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,821,"['Can', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'football', 'game', 'directed', 'less', 'icon', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'ever', 'match', 'sheer', 'joy', 'actual', 'NFL', 'game', 'No', 'matter', 'total', 'lack', 'subtlety', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'work', 'appropriate', 'football', 'movie', 'course', 'Damn', 'fine', 'movie', 'Real', 'celebrity', 'life', 'pro', 'football', 'player', ""n't"", 'real', 'here', 'too', 'Why', 'am', 'obsessed', 'sports', 'fan', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', 'know', 'very', 'cool', 'movie', 'lovely', 'Australian', 'non-sporty', 'wife', 'found', 'educational', 'not', 'gripping', 'enough', 'watch', '150', 'minutes', 'stopped', '90', 'think', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'when', 'recommend', 'good', 'movie', 'especially', 'fine', 'performances', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'course', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'many', 'NFL', 'stars', 'who', 'would', 'notice', 'sort', 'thing']",N/A
120172,A34NDNNY54LE1,0790749912,A Customer,"[1, 1]","ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is more than just one of the best movies made about professional sports, it's the latest installment in Stone's mythic quest to understand the big questions in human relationships, especially between men. Actually, this movie is not that remote from PLATOON, because both movies are set in a divisive scenario.Not since NORTH DALLAS FORTY, though, have the interactions between corporate politics and sports been examined. Stone portrays these aspects with a female owner, whose character is well-developed, but still surprising. Al Pacino is the other end of the equation, and his character's evolution from washed-up coach to second wind is the most poignant part of the film. In his casting choices, Stone adds nuance to every minor character. When Lawrence Taylor talks about a life outside of football, his character takes on layers of significance not seen in any other film. Jim Brown adds authenticity and old school values. Even Dennis Quaid, expands on a theme, one he examined in an earlier football movie, about the choices football players make and their sacrifices. McGinley and Woods, two Stone veterans, are there, too. Ann-Margret gives a great cameo performance, one that most wives and girlfriends of football fanatics would understand.The cinematography, however, is brilliant, and also draws on Stone's ground-breaking contributions to film. Like the head cam on Monday Night Football, his jaring, real-time shots capture the variations in speed and calculation that is football, but also conveys the bone-breaking pain that makes it so addictive to watch and play.But, Stone also gives his bloodsport a moral underpining. His is a call for purism, a return to 11 men in the huddle looking down the field. Little boys who just want to play ball. Filtering out the money, the pain-killers, the corporate and media politics, this movie makes football fun. This movie is for fans, and their loved ones, perhaps looking for a reason to understand the allure of football.",5,The Next Chapter In The Quest,1010707200,"01 11, 2002",2002,2004,"['GIVEN', 'SUNDAY', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'made', 'professional', 'sports', 'latest', 'installment', 'Stone', 'mythic', 'quest', 'understand', 'big', 'questions', 'human', 'relationships', 'especially', 'men', 'Actually', 'movie', 'not', 'remote', 'PLATOON', 'movies', 'are', 'set', 'divisive', 'scenario.Not', 'NORTH', 'DALLAS', 'FORTY', 'though', 'have', 'interactions', 'corporate', 'politics', 'sports', 'been', 'examined', 'Stone', 'aspects', 'female', 'owner', 'character', 'well-developed', 'still', 'surprising', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'other', 'end', 'equation', 'character', 'evolution', 'washed-up', 'coach', 'second', 'wind', 'most', 'poignant', 'part', 'film', 'casting', 'choices', 'Stone', 'nuance', 'minor', 'character', 'When', 'Lawrence', 'Taylor', 'talks', 'life', 'football', 'character', 'layers', 'significance', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'film', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'authenticity', 'old', 'school', 'values', 'Even', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'theme', 'one', 'examined', 'earlier', 'football', 'movie', 'choices', 'football', 'players', 'make', 'sacrifices', 'McGinley', 'Woods', 'two', 'Stone', 'veterans', 'are', 'there', 'too', 'Ann-Margret', 'great', 'cameo', 'performance', 'one', 'most', 'wives', 'girlfriends', 'football', 'fanatics', 'would', 'understand.The', 'cinematography', 'however', 'brilliant', 'also', 'draws', 'Stone', 'ground-breaking', 'contributions', 'film', 'head', 'cam', 'Monday', 'Night', 'Football', 'jaring', 'real-time', 'shots', 'capture', 'variations', 'speed', 'calculation', 'football', 'also', 'conveys', 'bone-breaking', 'pain', 'so', 'addictive', 'watch', 'play.But', 'Stone', 'also', 'bloodsport', 'moral', 'underpining', 'call', 'purism', 'return', '11', 'men', 'huddle', 'looking', 'down', 'field', 'Little', 'boys', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'play', 'ball', 'Filtering', 'out', 'money', 'pain-killers', 'corporate', 'media', 'politics', 'movie', 'football', 'fun', 'movie', 'fans', 'loved', 'ones', 'perhaps', 'looking', 'reason', 'understand', 'allure', 'football']",N/A

While this is clearly a phenomenal movie (see original review below), the Blu Ray just doesn't offer enough improvement over the original to justify.  Overall, its marginally cleaner, but the original DVD is pretty high quality anyway.This is a very entertaining movie on several different fronts.  First, its about football, but this isn't your typical varsity blues like soppy dramatic silly-ness.  This makes you feel like you're on the field with hard hitting, loud professional football.  Oliver Stone lends his directorial prowess to turn an otherwise massively overdone genre into an outstanding movie.  The camera work is incredible, and the editing is very well done.  And the characters are larger than life, in a way that is believably realistic.  In particular, Jamie Foxx's evolution from a timid and shy bench warmer to prima donna star is very well done, and is a particularly effective acting performance on his part.  I tend to this of this movie as an important evolutionary role bridging him from his Booty Call days to his to come oscar-worthy performances.",5,"Blu-Ray - not worth it, but is awesome fotball, awesome directing, awesome acting...",1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,1140,"['Just', 'purchased', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'definitely', 'not', 'clearly', 'phenomenal', 'movie', 'see', 'original', 'review', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'just', ""n't"", 'offer', 'enough', 'improvement', 'original', 'justify', 'Overall', 'marginally', 'cleaner', 'original', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'high', 'quality', 'anyway.This', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'several', 'different', 'fronts', 'First', 'football', ""n't"", 'typical', 'varsity', 'blues', 'soppy', 'dramatic', 'silly-ness', 'feel', ""'re"", 'field', 'hard', 'hitting', 'loud', 'professional', 'football', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'directorial', 'prowess', 'turn', 'otherwise', 'massively', 'overdone', 'genre', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'camera', 'work', 'incredible', 'editing', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'characters', 'are', 'larger', 'life', 'way', 'believably', 'realistic', 'particular', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'evolution', 'timid', 'shy', 'bench', 'warmer', 'prima', 'donna', 'star', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'particularly', 'effective', 'acting', 'performance', 'part', 'tend', 'movie', 'important', 'evolutionary', 'role', 'bridging', 'Booty', 'Call', 'days', 'come', 'oscar-worthy', 'performances']",N/A

It's been so long since he did anything that WASN'T affiliated to a political line that I don't know if he did one.  Stone had to base the togetherness of the football team characters with something in his own past, and I'm betting the time he spent in the military helped: the military teaches a large amount of togetherness and teamwork I never knew until I entered into it myself.The movie applies the Stone Technique, meaning hyperactive, music video camerawork and plot grit.  This movie would appear the most honest in comment about the American NFL sport and the people who play it.  This film actually has a plot, and it's carried out in detail.  This film is actually about something.  The characters are as large as Roman titans, and very sexy.  If you like pro football, you probably already saw this movie, as all of my Army buddies that like football have.  Myself, I really don't watch sports, but I thought this was a good movie and worth the money.  As I said, I don't know of a more honest football film.  This is definitely not a kids movie!  It follows a general line of past football films, but the Stone Treatment of the issue makes each player on the football field a titan, like Spartacus or Maximus from ""Gladiator"".  This film is the Mount Everest of ""teamwork movies"".The camerawork is really good.  Watching the movie, you'd think you're looking at ""Sports Illustrated"" magazine photos in motion.  I also enjoyed the montages, reminding me of John Frankenheimer's ""Grand Prix"" Cinerama spectacle.The cast is superb!  Jamie Foxx obliterates this role, as he did in his supporting role for ""Ali"", and one can see where he's going as an actor leading up to his recent roles in ""Collateral"" and ""Ray"", the Ray Charles movie; Oscar quality.  Al Pacino is another phenomenon in this movie, and he has one of the best climactic speeches I've seen in some time.  Dennis Quaid is good as a Dan Marino-type famous and aged quarterback, and James Woods and Cameron Diaz are really good.  I didn't expect Diaz to do as good a job.  Even LL Cool J was good.

120180,AY5ALNAA118ZL,0790749912,"A. Shane ""dresh""","[0, 2]","The game of American Football is, in many ways, a perfect movie sport. First of all, the game progresses in fits and starts, giving plenty of opportunity for dramatic buildup and suspense. Second, the offence and the defense take turns on the playing field, allowing the filmmakers to cut away to active players on the sidelines. Third, and probably most important, football is a sport that closely resembles an ancient battlefield; tight formations of armored men violently advancing and retrieving. This has been the stock and trade of action cinema from Birth Of A Nation to Braveheart.Oliver Stone's ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is certainly an action film. It throws you right on the field in the very first sequence and keeps you there for a good forty minutes of it's near 3 hours. Yet somehow, you get very little feeling for how the game is actually played. Sure, there's the controlled chaos, the violent hits, and the occasionally acrobatic intensity of the running game... but the game is somehow lost. Too bad because all the elements seem to be there.Al Pacino plays Tony D'Amato, a legendary head coach of the Miami Sharks. James Woods sinks his sharp little teeth into the team's sleazbag doctor. And Cameron Diaz, somewhat against type, is the bitch-on-wheels team owner. On top of that there's quarterbacks Jamie Foxx and Dennis Quade, Jim Brown, L.L. Cool J, Matthew Modine, and Ann-Margaret in a wonderful cameo. Oliver Stone is the ringmaster, and who could be a better choice? Someone who's both played the game (in college) as well as seen the battlefield (in Viet Nam). ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, unfortunately, is somewhat less than the sum of its parts; failing to live up to its promise as the ""ultimate football film"".Now, don't get me wrong, ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is full of fun touches. The performances are uniformly terrific and the action is often spectacular. But the film gets so caught up in clich&eacute; that it gets difficult to take by the time it's over. Of course, all sports films rely on a certain amount of clich&eacute;; it's really just a part of the package. But do we need to see all of the sports film cliches packed into one film? There's the over-the-hill quarterback looking for one more shot, the young star learning how to be a team player, the evil money-grubbing owner who doesn't give a damn about the players or the integrity of the game, and the idealistic coach trying to hold the team together and to take them to the playoffs, etc, etc, etc.. All this, as always, culminates in the ""big game"" finale that miraculously solves all dilemmas and resolves all conflicts. The film's biggest surprise (such as it is) comes over the closing credits, by which time I couldn't care less.Here's a couple more small gripes. One: all through the film everyone is referring to Coach D'Amato as an ""old dinosaur"". Huh? Who are they talking about? Pacino looks great, not a day over fifty!

There is constant conflict on the field and in the locker room.  The quarterback, Willie Beaman, played by a comedian was non-descript at first, hardly legible as he did not know how to play a straight role.  He was told that the quarterback is always the star, but he wanted to make his own plays in the huddle instead of what the coach ordered.  Willie is constantly feuding with his coach and just about everyone else.Shakespeare wrote in his play, 'Julius Caesar,' ""Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant never taste of death but once.""  Now, that he has a taste of the good life (he'd been hurt emotionally in college and dropped out), he argued with Vanessa, his live-in 'baby girl' of seven years telling her that he felt inferior to her education.  Actually, he'd been 'taken' with a Nicole-type character and decided he might as well be O.J.  He asked Christina out for a date.She was more interested in the power plays and conflict with the coach she did not like, Tony (played by Al Pacino).  She felt that this Miami team had belonged to her dead father, and she should call the plays.  ""He wasn't a genius, just thought he was"" she was told.There is a player (#19) who resembled Frank Gifford and has his own interpersonal problems; guess that was before he hooked up with Cathy Lee.  Blonde Christina in her backless black evening frock looked like dark-haired Belinda at KAT, and sounded as false.Here I am watching football, and I don't like football!  In high school, I saw maybe two of those Cecil played as the extra-point kicker/left end. And I had a big crush on Jim Darling, a member of that team at Central High. Then Zach (#13 like Willie) played in junior high and one year in high school and was a minor star.  Justin was the quarterback for his non-league team.  So, there are sports in my family.  Jeff's 'sport' was as a lifesaver at the local public swimming pool.Willie progressed, even though he still had low self-esteem, onto the covers of 'Sports Illustrated' and 'ESPN' magazines.  The touchdown by #89 was spectacular. and the red flag on the field added interest. The cheerleaders were par for the course.  At the swimming pool party, the ""Poster Boy"" was called to his task for his attitude.  He was told he was not a team player and ""you must sacrifice"" so they could heal as a team.  He was told he had intercranial bleeding in the head.  Wish mine was there instead of the liver and maybe I would have a chance to live longer.At the press conference, Coach Tony admitted he had over reacted.  ""When you get old in life, margin or error is so small; every second counts.  It makes all the difference between winning and losing, living and dying.""  At the big dance affair, the music was well chosen: 'That's The Way I Like It' and 'Dancing Cheek to Cheek.'

He Holds his own in scenes with Al Pacino and Dennis Quaid; he even steals the show from them at some points.This was quite a Shock to me, as Al Pacino and James Woods are two of my Favourite Actors. I Expected more from them, and I expected more from the film.For the first Two hours of the films Three hour running time, Oliver Stone shows us something we haven't seen before, Behind the Scenes of the NFL. We see the Crooked Doctors, filling the injured players up with drugs to keep them playing. We see a lot more drug taking by the players Off the field. We see the In-fighting, the Politics of it all; we see everything they don't show us at Game time, Sunday morning.But then, in the last hour, everyone in the film Matures, learns the Errors of their ways. It all becomes totally Cliqued and Silly. In a matter of minutes it turns from an Honest Expos&eacute; into a Silly, Run-of-the-mill Football movie. It turns into ""The Replacements"" without the humour or any sense of fun.Still, if you can forgive these fairly Large Misgivings, there are Great Performances to enjoy... Well, actually, Great Actors to enjoy. Al Pacino, James Woods, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz and Matthew Modine give performances that vary from Brilliant to Bad. Diaz at least tries to do a different role, and it comes off Ok, a little Annoying at times. Al and James do what is required of them, they Yell a lot and look Fierce. Dennis Quaid gives one of the Better performances, he looks Young and Tough enough to be playing the game, but also Old and Weathered enough to be wanting Out of it all. Matthew Modine looks like he signed on for the paycheque, he puts no effort into his dialogue and every time he opens his mouth, he Angered me. (What happened to him after ""Full Metal Jacket"") Charlton Heston's Cameo is a great moment, he proves why he is such a legend with about 2 minutes of Screen time. (Oliver Stone's cameo as a Commentator is pretty good to)Jamie Foxx and LL Cool J steal the rug from under the Big named stars and both give Star-making Performances. I cannot complement them enough, I saw the movie so I could see Pacino and Woods, and I come out Raving about Foxx and Cool J. The Mere fact that they act opposite Al and Yell more than him, are more Passionate than he is should easily convince those Unbelievers out there.""Any Given Sunday"" is a Flawed film that Should have been something Much Greater. It Almost Was, but it Dramatically loses its way in the Third act.

As bad, it also  featured one of my favorite actors, Al Pacino.  Finally, when it came out  on DVD, I had to give it a try.  Stone and Pacino came through strongly  once again, I must admit.  Similar to Stone's taking us into the Vietnam  War at &quot;grunt&quot; level, in this film he lets us experience football  right out on the field with the players.  He spares us nothing.  It is  incredibly violent and you hear, see and feel all of that violence.  Actually, I found it more violent than &quot;Platoon.&quot;  I'm glad I saw  it on DVD because I don't think I could have stood the level of violence in  a movie theater.  Stone's one consistent flaw is usually weak roles for  women but not in this movie.  Cameron Diaz is the very vital yet ruthless  team owner.  She inherited the team from her father and is going to make it  work come hell or high water.  This woman lets nothing and no one stand in  her way.  I even liked Ann-Margret as her mother, who has always taken 3rd  place to football in the family.  I literally had to turn away from the  violence in chunks of the film though and I've never had to do that  watching a Stone film before, even for &quot;Natural Born Killers.&quot;  Maybe because I believe football is so stupid, I just can't stomach that  anyone would do this to himself for the money alone, whereas psychopaths  enjoying killing people in &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;, makes some  sick sense, sad to say.  One example of senseless mayhem is the quarterback  played by Dennis Quaid.  He is virtually losing his vision by the end of  the movie and the rest of his body is falling apart--still in his 30s, no  less.  His wife slaps him in the face when he says he better leave football  for his health. As usual,  Stone makes the movie a multimedia event and it  is cleverly intercut throughout with every medium of expression known in  the arts, in absolutely seamless fashion.  My husband is not a football  watcher either but he adored this movie and would give it a 5, I'm sure.  If you are a big football fan, you will probably give it a 5 too.  This may  have been literally my last football game so Mr. Stone should feel  flattered.

120191,A2YXMN40D7WTGP,0790749912,casualsuede,"[7, 8]","I am a passing football viewer (go Jets!) and I was interested in this movie, not because of the football, not because of Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz or Oliver Stone, because I love NFL films.  They makes some of the best recordings and could give all other sports filmworks a run for their money.  They take the gridiron and change it into the stuff of legends.  When I saw my first NFL tape, I didn't know Football could be so dramatic.The movie is based on several characters of the fake Miami Sharks.  The first is the aging coach, who is losing control of his team to an owner who thinks she knows more about the game than the old grizzled 30 year veteran.  The coach is a worn out Al Pacino, who shines in the role of Tony D'Amato.  Al would make a great coach, because all he does is give grandiose speeches in his movies and yell real loud.  The owner is Cameron Diaz, who took over the team when her father died.  She has real veins of steel in this movie and goes toe to toe with Pacino and gives as well as she gets.  Their relationship is very stormy and a delight to watch them both.Another story is about Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx).  He is the the (Kurt) Warneresque third string QB given a chance to shine when the aging star Cap Rooney is injured.  He is so nervous that he pukes on the fifty yard line (Right on the Team Logo!), but he begins to shine and nearly wins his first game for them.  He is humble and awestruck in the early stages of the movie, but once his career gets going, he becomes this arrogant jerk who suddenly begins to think he's god gift to football.  His arrogance nearly upends the team, as he disregards plays the coach tell him to run, he disses their star player Julian Washington (LL Cool J) and ...... of the Defensive Captain Luther Lavoy (A mean Lawrence Taylor).  Jamie Foxx's performance steals this movie away from all the other high profile actors.  He has this intensity that I never saw on his stupid Jamie Foxx show and he has the tools to become a great actor.  Just look at his fire at a dinner meeting he has with Pacino.Cap Rooney is a sub-story and his is about the aging superstar (read: Dan Marino).  He is still good, but age is getting to him and he becomes paranoid about slipping into oblivion when Beaman is discovered.  The relationship with Beaman is all politically driven and the pressures on Rooney are intense (especially from his wife, played with icyness by Lauren Holly).The final sub-story is with Lawrence Taylor, Cap Rooney and the two doctors Dr. Mandrake (James Woods) and Allie Powers (Matthew Modine).  Stone takes a stab at the back-end politics of Football, how the owners and doctors really only see these people as pieces of meat money-makers.  One chilling scene is between Diaz and Woods, where she applies the non too subtle pressure to play Lavoy for the final, even if it will cost him his life.  Mandrake, apart of the system and paid handsomely for it, is more than happy to oblige.The story also takes other issues such as racism in the Football league, owners plotting to get new stadiums, the immoralities of being a ball player, people giving up everything (including family) for the game as well as players playing for performance bonuses, rather than for the team.The DVD has excellent picture and the sound is fantastic.  The mixture of hip-hop and Metallica really intensifies the adrenaline in the picture.  The extras are pretty slim though, with only a trailer, video by LL Cool J (......) and the making.While the performances all stand out (including non-actor Lawrence Taylor), the directing is mixed.  There are some excellent scenes and the hit on Beaman in the rain (where his helmet goes flying) had some slow motion scenes, the ones involving the shaky cam (for realistic effect) were annoying, even nauseating to watch.  Stone is an advocate for quick cuts, but at times it's so fast that all I get is a headache.  If only we could get that director who did all those NFL films, then I would have given this movie a much higher rating....Rating: B-",3,Oliver Stone tries out for NFL Films.,969840000,"09 25, 2000",2000,4058,"['am', 'passing', 'football', 'viewer', 'go', 'Jets', 'was', 'interested', 'movie', 'not', 'football', 'not', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'love', 'NFL', 'films', 'best', 'recordings', 'could', 'give', 'other', 'sports', 'run', 'money', 'take', 'gridiron', 'change', 'stuff', 'legends', 'When', 'saw', 'first', 'NFL', 'tape', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Football', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'dramatic.The', 'movie', 'based', 'several', 'characters', 'fake', 'Miami', 'Sharks', 'first', 'aging', 'coach', 'who', 'losing', 'control', 'team', 'owner', 'who', 'more', 'game', 'old', 'grizzled', '30', 'year', 'veteran', 'coach', 'worn', 'out', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'who', 'role', 'Tony', ""D'Amato"", 'Al', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'coach', 'give', 'grandiose', 'speeches', 'movies', 'yell', 'real', 'loud', 'owner', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'who', 'took', 'over', 'team', 'when', 'father', 'died', 'real', 'veins', 'steel', 'movie', 'toe', 'toe', 'Pacino', 'as', 'well', 'relationship', 'very', 'stormy', 'delight', 'watch', 'both.Another', 'story', 'Willie', 'Beaman', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Kurt', 'Warneresque', 'third', 'string', 'QB', 'given', 'chance', 'shine', 'when', 'aging', 'star', 'Cap', 'Rooney', 'injured', 'so', 'nervous', 'fifty', 'yard', 'line', 'Right', 'Team', 'Logo', 'shine', 'nearly', 'first', 'game', 'humble', 'awestruck', 'early', 'stages', 'movie', 'once', 'career', 'going', 'arrogant', 'jerk', 'who', 'suddenly', 'think', 'god', 'gift', 'football', 'arrogance', 'nearly', 'team', 'coach', 'tell', 'run', 'star', 'player', 'Julian', 'Washington', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'Defensive', 'Captain', 'Luther', 'Lavoy', 'A', 'mean', 'Lawrence', 'Taylor', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'performance', 'steals', 'movie', 'away', 'other', 'high', 'profile', 'actors', 'intensity', 'never', 'saw', 'stupid', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'show', 'tools', 'become', 'great', 'actor', 'Just', 'look', 'fire', 'dinner', 'meeting', 'Pacino.Cap', 'Rooney', 'sub-story', 'aging', 'superstar', 'read', 'Dan', 'Marino', 'still', 'good', 'age', 'getting', 'paranoid', 'slipping', 'oblivion', 'when', 'Beaman', 'discovered', 'relationship', 'Beaman', 'politically', 'driven', 'pressures', 'Rooney', 'are', 'intense', 'especially', 'wife', 'played', 'icyness', 'Lauren', 'Holly', '.The', 'final', 'sub-story', 'Lawrence', 'Taylor', 'Cap', 'Rooney', 'two', 'doctors', 'Dr.', 'Mandrake', 'James', 'Woods', 'Allie', 'Powers', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'Stone', 'stab', 'back-end', 'politics', 'Football', 'how', 'owners', 'doctors', 'really', 'only', 'see', 'people', 'pieces', 'meat', 'money-makers', 'One', 'chilling', 'scene', 'Diaz', 'Woods', 'where', 'non', 'too', 'subtle', 'pressure', 'play', 'Lavoy', 'final', 'even', 'will', 'cost', 'life', 'Mandrake', 'apart', 'system', 'paid', 'handsomely', 'more', 'happy', 'oblige.The', 'story', 'also', 'other', 'issues', 'such', 'racism', 'Football', 'league', 'owners', 'plotting', 'get', 'new', 'stadiums', 'immoralities', 'being', 'ball', 'player', 'people', 'giving', 'up', 'everything', 'including', 'family', 'game', 'as', 'well', 'players', 'playing', 'performance', 'bonuses', 'rather', 'team.The', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'picture', 'sound', 'fantastic', 'mixture', 'hip-hop', 'Metallica', 'really', 'adrenaline', 'picture', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'slim', 'only', 'trailer', 'video', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'making.While', 'performances', 'stand', 'out', 'including', 'non-actor', 'Lawrence', 'Taylor', 'directing', 'mixed', 'are', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'hit', 'Beaman', 'rain', 'where', 'helmet', 'flying', 'had', 'slow', 'motion', 'scenes', 'ones', 'involving', 'shaky', 'cam', 'realistic', 'effect', 'were', 'annoying', 'even', 'nauseating', 'watch', 'Stone', 'advocate', 'quick', 'cuts', 'times', 'so', 'fast', 'get', 'headache', 'only', 'could', 'get', 'director', 'who', 'did', 'NFL', 'films', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'much', 'higher', 'rating', '.Rating', 'B-']",N/A

The movie packs more stars than a Cannonball Run movie! Al Pacino stars as Tony D'Amato, experienced head coach of the professional football team, the Miami Sharks. Having to deal with the loss of his 39 year old, 3 time MVP Quarterback played by Dennis Quaid (think of a has-been like Steve Young!), he's forced to start a young and upcoming  3rd string QB, Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx). As the movie progresses, Beamen gets the taste of the real football world; such as, women, money, cars and the fast life. Losing his extremely beautiful girlfriend in the process, played by Lela Rochon. As Beamen's ego keeps building and building, so are the anger towards him from fellow team mates, played by LL Cool J and Lawrence Taylor. At the same time, you find Coach D'Amato fighting his own personal battles with Beamen and the Sharks owner, played by Cameron Diaz.The movie also stars James Woods, Charlton Heston, Matthew Modine, Bill Bellamy, Lauren Holly, Jim Brown, Ann Margret and Oliver Stone himself. What I didn't like about the movie was the camera angles and shots that Oliver Stone took. He also over did it on the slow motion shots. If he would've cut down on that, it would've put the movie right under 2 hours. What I liked about it was the little humor that was in it every once in a while. Also, Jamie Foxx played a less comical role and more of a serious role. Overall, I would give the movie 3 1/2 stars. I was very disappointed with the ending.

The &quot;win at all costs&quot; mentality was always perceived as &quot;boyish competion&quot; and for many years the behind the door cruelty of the game was hushed. God Forbid, we disrupt the sanctity of the NFL and it's millions of fans perched high upon their lazy-boys with Budweiser's in tow. &quot;Any Given&quot; gives us an upclose and personal look at those horrors. Be it medical malpractice, contract disputes or genuine bad behavior the state of the Miami Sharks is in shambles. Coach Dematto, played with a contrived enthusiasm by Pacino, is short on energy and considered a dinasour in today's fast paced game. Cameron Diaz plays the megaowner who's lost in her late daddy's shadow, with intentions to sell the team and undermine Dematto. With the multitude of characters Pacino has played with consumate authentication; I just cannot perceive him as a head football coach. His halftime speech is awful and seems less spontaneous and more rehearsed.

120198,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,0790749912,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[3, 9]","Oliver Stone likes beating up the people who decide to watchhis movies.He does it here not to show us El Salvador, or a famousrock band or politics , or how the media assaults us,or even theVietnam War,-- he does it because of football.FOOTBALL?And he has nothing more to say than was already very well stated in a much better film, North Dallas Forty.There aren't just  five or six multiple quick cut establishing shots to begin nearly every scene in this film, there are a dozens.  There are strange shots which make no sense whatsoever but merely serve as something that was shot to stick between two other shots.  There are triple and quadruple angles on charging football players, shots from inside football helmets, crane shots, steadicam shots, and lots of tracking and hand held shots.  You don't get any sense of what play is being run however. You're not ever shown a complete play from start to finish.  We just get chaos.There are huge booming bangs and mini-explosions as football player tackle each other and then suddenly, the sound disappears completely.  There's slow-mo, there's some digitally altered work with motion and speed.  It's all here.Why?To excite, titilate, entertain, overwhelm and bulldoze an audience into thinking it's watching an important Oliver Stone movie of course.Because of the flash and over-kill it takes Stone a full 45 minutes to set up the film. It could have been done in ten.  Lots of characters to introduce us to.  None of them are original and none of them will have any depth.  Oh sure there's an impressive list of actors on view, and I almost expected Bruce Dern as a terrorist and the Goodyear blimp to show up.  The plot?  Not a lot to that either. The Miami Sharks have lost 4 games straight and the once great team may not make the play-offs.  It's star quarterback is getting old and yikes... gets badly injured.  Out of nowhere the third string quarterback shows promise, but he's not a team player.  The coach has lost his fire for the game.  The new team owner is a young overly ambitious woman who wants to prove she can more ruthless and heartless than anyone.. even Steinbrenner!!!  She wants to win and doesn't care who she has to threaten, fire, or manipulate to do it.  Sound familiar?Of course it does.All of the characters we meet in Any Given Sunday are familiar and you the viewer can color them in.  In fact, you better have a lot crayons  because as these characters are written there isn't much offered in terms of depth or nuance.  Nuance?  Who's got time for such things in a 2 and a half hour Oliver Stone movie.  Now pardon me while I add some elements to this shot... I'll have some music playing, I'll have a sports guy on the television talking quite negatively about the coach of the Sharks (Al Pacino) while he sits in the crowded bar getting very drunk (what a man!) and is propositioned by a young high priced hooker, Elizabeth Berkley.  They'll seem like there are five or six things  going on at once.  Of course none of it is very important, or original, but  the audience will be just over-whelmed with all this stuff, all this detail.  Well unimportant, details... but lots of them.  Movement, noise, lots of cuts.There are some great shots in this movie.  But when you throw this much at the wall, some of it has to stick.Occasionally, when you senses aren't being over-loaded and assaulted by a chaotic cacophony of sound, camera movement and weird quick cuts and camera angles, you realize there are some really awful bits of dialogue being spouted in this film. In fact there are several scenes which really needed a zinger, a clever line, a nice bit of business, a special moment, to make the scene work or even have any purpose whatsoever-and  we get nothing.  It lies there.  Well it doesn't lie there exactly because we are always cutting, the camera is always moving.There might be some people who are fooled by this technique, but most will get very tired of it after the films first half hour.  It doesn't build, it has no where to go, it's already started at a manic over-the top level.  Where is it going to go?What's really annoying is how repetitive the film.  You have all these camera angles, all these tricks, all this coverage of every conceivable angle. . . from a puppet master director who doesn't trust his audience, his script or even his actors.  He manipulates every single aspect of what we are watching.  Rarely is a shot held for move than a few seconds.  He keeps moving but it's over the same territory over and over and over again.It wides up not being exhilarating, not being revealing, just head-ache inducing.Over and over and over again we are shown bits of pieces of the game in almost the same way. Once, twice, three and four times we see similar types of shots of crowds, fans, coaches, players, refs, cheerleaders, people in the press box...(.  Eeek.. There's Oliver Stone doing play by play announcing) not just introducing the big game... but as a prelude to every game we see, even to one of the practices.  Look look...  We got a big budget to spend and we can hire lots of extras... I can shoot lots and lots of film.  Looky Looky...!!!!It gets really ridiculous at times if you're not too numb and utterly desensitized to pay attention. Like when we hear an announcer on t.v.  talking about `a swirl of events', and the camera is on a team graphic and begins to swirl slightly as it cuts to another shot, probably one of a team flag, there's lots of shots of team flags.  What clever, brilliant, film-making.There's nothing new here, just flash and more flash on a subject that's been written about and filmed many times and more effectively than Stone manages to do. Go see North Dallas Forty, or Hoop Dreams again before bothering with this time-waster that will wind up making aspirin manufacturers some extra profits.I can just imagine Oliver Stone someday doing a commentary track for this film (he doesn't on DVD out now) and talking about how shortened  attention spans ,challenged him to create the ultimate modern football/gladiator movie.  A movie where the game is more than a game.  And of course when a game becomes more important than just a game it means the participants must sacrifice everything real--marriages, morals, even ethics and so his movie sacrifices everything in presenting the GAME.  Uh-huh.  Even if Stone were to actually say something like this, it would be far more interesting than anything he has presented to us in this chaotic, numbing, repetitive, headache inducing, everything but the kitchen sink two and a half hour update of  ESPN's best of Sport Center: The  Football edition  he has the temerity to call a film.Chris Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

A very in your face type of movie.I love the idea of a football movie taking the role of more of an action movie, as opposed to a football movie.  I think everyone needs a bit of pure action fun every once in a while, and that's what this movie provides.Of course, that doesn't mean you don't gain some slight care for what happens to the characters as they battle on and off the field.  The aging quarterback trying to hold on to his career and family.  The young quarterback fighting for his newly gained position and with his newly gained fame.

I could use just about any adjective in the english vocabulary to describe this film, good or bad, and it would probably fit.  It seems like for everything that's good in this film, there's also something that's bad, so it cancels itself out.  For those who've seen the film, what was the deal with the Ann Margaret character?  Was she drunk, or dilusional, or what?  On the other hand, Steamin' Willie Beamen (played perfectly by Jamie Foxx) is one of the better characters ever in a sports flick.  Without Willie Beamen, this film is probably a dud, which is a shame, because it should have been so much better.  Pacino over-acts quite a bit (he's been doing that a lot lately), but it's balanced out by great supporting performances and a stellar soundtrack.  Anyway, being a huge football fan, I liked the movie, but I can't say that it was any better than average.  I can't shake the feeling that this movie would have been better if I had more input.

It shows the true events of a common professional football team. Their ups and downs are both included; this movie isn't just football; it dives into the lives of professional athletes and is very descriptive in that it shows how they(players) often get wrapped up in greed, hate and envy. It shows of how friends can turn against each other in the case of greed and it shows things such as the players and coaches opinions of the mass media. The players and management study their sports on and off the gridiron. When the movie shows the game going on, it feels like you're playing. It is right there with the play and every sound made and movement is right with you and it shows everyone what it is really like. Contrary to other football movies like &quot;The Replacements&quot;, it doesn't say that the good guys always win. BELIEVABLE STORY.  Pacino does another very convincing and emotional role and Jamie Foxx does fairly decent in one of his non-comedy roles.

How could it be as bad as everyone had said, just look at the  cast that signed there names along the dotted line? Well, it was bad.....oh  my goodness, it was worse than bad, save for the well choreographed  football scenes and always excellent acting from Pacino, this movie is  incoherant tedium. We watch as overpampered football &quot;heroes&quot; go  about their daily lives with such regular routines as chainsawing team  mates sports cars and dabbling in sex and drugs. I was not surprised then  to watch some of Hollywoods best actors walk around in a daze as the movie  stumbles from one game to another. The scene index for the DVD is a big  clue to the importance of the games to this moviw with eacxh one seeiming  to start a new act.

Al Pacino plays the head coach of the mediocre Miami Sharks, Tony D'Amato, an underdog team that has just lost it's first string quarterback, played by Dennis Quaid, and it's second string quarterback in back-to-back plays. Pacino has no choice but to send in the inexperienced Willie Beaman. My biggest suprise was that Jamie Fox from the WB network, who plays Beaman, was fantastic. He was so good he should have been nominated for best supporting actor that year. Other performances are played by Hames Woods, LL Cool J, and Cameron Diaz, as the owner of team and the niece of Pacino.Willie Beaman starts off horribly, but gradually improves and becomes the team's star player. But the success goes to his head, and gets under Pacino's skin. Beaman changes the plays in the huddles without the coach's or offensive coordinator's consent, and runs off at the mouth with teammates and to Pacino. But he is winning the games, and (almost) everyone watching likes Beaman, forcing Al Pacino to reevaluate the way he coaches, if winning is more important than teamwork and playing hard.When it comes to the football sequences, the cinemtography is wonderful, this is where Oliver Stone shows his true talent. You feel like you are on the field, especially with the digital sound and great picture that accompanies this disc.

The film simply takes itself way, way too seriously.

That's how overdone &amp; stilted this film is.  At its best, the direction is strange &amp; at its worse....well, it's downright silly.The movie contains some former football players, such as Lawrence Taylor, but their inclusion does little to either help or hamper the film.

Somehow, it doesn't feel formulaic because Stone and his case invest and bring so much energy to the preceedings.  The NFL scenes are relentlessly outlandish, most say they are unrealistic; So what, if they were realistic you would be watching a regular football game, why would you want to do that.  The cast is uniformly excellent, Al Pacino isn't disappointing as he rarely if ever is.  Cameron Diaz is amazing as the team owner who can more than act head on with Pacino.

It does not matter if he is a Mafia man, a football coach or a 60 Minutes producer... I think in each of the films (Donnie Brasco, Any Given Sunday, and The Insider, respectively), he has been someone's protector, insisting almost verbatim, ""I fought for you..."" In Donnie Brasco he takes Donnie (Johnny Depp) under his wing and mentors him and feels about him as though he were a son. In the Insider, he is a passionate 60 Minutes producer who convinces Jeffrey Wigand to be a whistlerblower on tobacco companies. When 60 Minutes will not air the piece, Pacino is livid and when confronted by Russell Crowe (as Wigand) he yells, ""I fought for you..."" In this film, Any Given Sunday, he feels paternal about his aging quarterback, Dennis Quaid, and tells him how he will fight for him and how he feels about him like a son. How many times do we need to see the same performance? I know, I might be stomping on hallowed ground. Pacino has paid his dues and I should not criticise, but has this thought occurred to anyone? That he has been playing and replaying the same roles? Of course, he is a prolific actor and there are many roles he has played which have no resemblance to these, but I am just picking out a pattern. Cannot be ignored. And he is superb in all these performances, so I am not complaining. I liked this film. It was an interesting look at football and its place in American society. I think, personally, that it is taken far too seriously, and I don't care about it. But to see that it warrants this kind of attention is a fascinating thought. It is interesting to see Pacino as a coach who appears to be in the twilight of his coaching career. He is being driven out by his traditional views, by the rich, young and aggressive woman who is in charge of the team (Cameron Diaz in a spectacularly bitchy role). Ageism is at work. She wants to push Pacino out to make room for Aaron Eckhart as coach. This has an interesting directorial style, probably because it was directed by Oliver Stone... you can always count on him for something at least a little out of the ordinary.

120214,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0790749912,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 4]","I love sports and sports flicks.  That is the very reason I didn't care for this film.  This film is not a film about football; it is a film about  Oliver Stone.  With ""Any Given Sunday"", Stone has created his most  ambitious tribute to his own megalomania.  This film is a classic example  of excessive style negating substance.  Stone was so intent on showing us  the sizzle, that he cooked all of the flavor out of the steak.  A good  director uses innovative technique to enhance the telling of the story.  An  egomaniac uses the story as an excuse to show off his talent and  creativity.  The result of such self-indulgence is almost always a  diminishment of the final product.Here Stone tries to out-hip the hip  generation of directors by providing a staccato progression of weird  angles, extreme close-ups and disjointed perspective shots with so many  jump cuts that it makes ""The Limey"" look like it is on tranquilizers.  I  have never seen so much dialogue delivered by actors with half their heads  cut off.  The hand held football sequences were dreadful; as cameras were  pounded into the turf without regard to the action that we were supposed to  be following.  The entire movie was like a three-hour music video, with  images flitting willy-nilly as if they were being shot by a drunken  mosquito.  Ironically, Stone failed to learn the lesson learned by Willie  Beaman (Jamie Foxx) in the story; that is that the good of the whole is  more important than the glory of the individual.It is a pity, because  buried beneath all this decadent directorial tripe, there was a good sports  story and some terrific acting.  We saw how money and greed adulterates the  sport and how athletes too often become selfish and conceited as they bask  in the limelight.  There was also the drama of the comeback in the critical  game, which was dissipated by Stone's erratic camera work and editing.Al  Pacino gave a great performance as the legendary coach past his prime, who  let his pride stand in the way of the team's success.  Cameron Diaz rose  above her accustomed quirky lightweight roles to deliver a stunning  performance as the hard-as-nails club owner trying to move out of her dead  father's shadow.

I won't waste your time with details; there are plenty of other reviews. Let's just say that I hope Oliver Stone was ""exaggerating"" for commercial purposes that have nothing to do with reality. I'm a once-a-year football fan at most, but if the world of professional football is as lurid and vile as Stone portrays it, I'd regret even a single hour staring at the Tube or a single ticket's price. Actually one of the sour egomaniacs in the film laments the state of things in pro ball post TV and preaches that the sport itself is ""pure"". Or was ""pure"". Or may still be ""pure"" in some high school environment in Arcadia. If ""purity"" grows up to be this sort of swinishness, there's a case to be made for purging ""our"" schools of sports.Aside from socio-moralistic matters, this is a lousy film on its own terms. There's way too much ""cinerrhea"" -- too many flittery fuzzy gimmicks and film editor's flummeries. The action moments are simply spat out without any build-up, and then repeated ad nauseam. How many times does it work to show a passed football in slooow motion soaring thirty yards over the hunkered hulks of the linemen for a stop-action touchdown? And the acting is lousy, with the exception of Charlton Heston's 20-second coup as the commissioner and Cameron Diaz's warp-speed performance as a 3!T$X from H&99. Even that loathly masterpiece of actressing is spoiled in the last minutes of the film by Diaz's utterly unconvincing repentance, but that's not Diaz's fault; it's Stone's and John Logan's, for scribbling such an awful script. Diaz's instantaneous reformation isn't alone; the showboating quarterback played by Jamie Foxx has a ""Road to Damascus"" conversion also, that's laughably implausible. And if I were poor Dennis Quaid, I'd sue to have my name removed from the titles; Quaid's no Lawrence Olivier, to be sure, but he deserved at least half a chance to earn his outrageous salary by being given a role that didn't doom him to looking like a meatball.",1,I guess I'm still a Sunday School farm boy at heart ...,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,2081,"['found', 'characters', 'life', 'style', 'depicted', 'film', 'profoundly', 'disgusting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'details', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'reviews', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'hope', 'Stone', 'was', 'exaggerating', 'commercial', 'purposes', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'reality', ""'m"", 'once-a-year', 'football', 'fan', 'most', 'world', 'professional', 'football', 'lurid', 'vile', 'Stone', ""'d"", 'regret', 'even', 'single', 'hour', 'staring', 'Tube', 'single', 'ticket', 'price', 'Actually', 'one', 'sour', 'egomaniacs', 'film', 'state', 'things', 'pro', 'ball', 'post', 'TV', 'preaches', 'sport', 'pure', 'was', 'pure', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'pure', 'high', 'school', 'environment', 'Arcadia', 'purity', 'up', 'be', 'sort', 'swinishness', 'case', 'be', 'made', 'purging', 'schools', 'sports.Aside', 'socio-moralistic', 'matters', 'lousy', 'film', 'own', 'terms', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'cinerrhea', 'too', 'many', 'flittery', 'fuzzy', 'gimmicks', 'film', 'editor', 'flummeries', 'action', 'moments', 'are', 'simply', 'spat', 'out', 'build-up', 'then', 'repeated', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'work', 'show', 'passed', 'football', 'slooow', 'motion', 'soaring', 'thirty', 'yards', 'hunkered', 'hulks', 'linemen', 'stop-action', 'touchdown', 'acting', 'lousy', 'exception', 'Charlton', 'Heston', '20-second', 'coup', 'commissioner', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'warp-speed', 'performance', '3', 'T', 'X', 'H', '99', 'Even', 'loathly', 'masterpiece', 'actressing', 'spoiled', 'last', 'minutes', 'film', 'Diaz', 'utterly', 'unconvincing', 'repentance', 'not', 'Diaz', 'fault', 'Stone', 'John', 'Logan', 'scribbling', 'awful', 'script', 'Diaz', 'instantaneous', 'reformation', ""n't"", 'alone', 'showboating', 'quarterback', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Road', 'Damascus', 'conversion', 'also', 'laughably', 'implausible', 'were', 'poor', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', ""'d"", 'sue', 'have', 'name', 'removed', 'titles', 'Quaid', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'be', 'sure', 'deserved', 'least', 'chance', 'earn', 'outrageous', 'salary', 'being', 'given', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'doom', 'looking', 'meatball']",N/A

The movie begins very well by dropping us right into the middle of a game.  The camera work here is excellent (as it is in most of the movie) and we are able to both follow the action of the game and feel the intensity of the players.  But the aspect of most interest is the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; look it gives us.  For example, right off the bat the quarterback (Dennis Quaid) goes down.  The coach (Al Pacino) and the other players aren't to worried until the TV Coverage cuts to commercial and Quaid still can't get up.  Meanwhile the manager (Cameron Diaz) is upstairs haggling over the line-coaching staff and how soon Quaid will be back.Unfortunately as the movie goes on it stops giving the viewer a new take on football and settles for the standard ESPN-style glorification of the &quot;gladiators&quot; who sacrifice so much to play the game.

This one was definately not at the  top of my list.Despite obvious attempts to make this opus as  heart-pounding as possible, Director Oliver Stone created arguably the most  boring football movie ever made.

We are presented with montage after montage of football  images past and present during important expositional scenes which are few  and far between.

The blood, guts, girls, drugs, injuries...blah, blah, blah.  Any Given Sunday is just that...blah!  This mostly impart because of the acting and writing.  Al Pacino does a brilliant job of portraying head coach, Tony D'Amato and John C. McGinley, a great character actor, as his biggest critic.  Other than that there really isn't anything to right home about.  Cameron Diaz, the owner of the Sharks cannot pull off the ""She would eat her own children"" remark whispered by a colleague, simply because she is all over the board with her emotions.  One moment she is screaming at Al, the next sympathetic, so she didn't come off as bad as I think was planned.Sadly these performances are the result of the writing.  I got a little tired of the ""this is your last season"" hints and the same old arguments over and over again.  Where is the variety?!?!  Then you have Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Joe Montana...oh, I mean Jack ""Cap"" Rooney.  Puhleez!

This film is a mess, with a plot  that even a six year old could have written, filled with every cliche in  the book like the aging quarterback who wants one more season, and the  brash rookie looking to take his spot.  The theme of commercialism reoccurs  throughout Any Given Sunday and just fits in perfectly with another  pointless Stone observation (i.e. Violence in the Media from Natural Born  Killers).  Yes, every modern day football fan knows that the NFL is all  about money, TV contracts, and endorsements, SO WHAT!  This movie is not a  glimpse behind the scenes into what its really like to be a football  player, its more like an old episode of HBO's 1st and Ten.  Don't even get  me started on Cameron Diaz because her casting in the film as the owner was  just plain atrocious.  Jamie Foxx is the only good thing about this film,  as he proves he can do more than just comedy.

This movie is interesting from start to somewhere decidedly south of finish.It is painfully obvious that Oliver Stone directed.  In some of his other works, such as Natual Born Killers, the cutaway scenes randomly inserted MTV-style seem to work.  Then again, Any Given Sunday is not an exploration of the minds of serial killers, it's a football movie.  Thus, when dialogue is happening and the camera cuts away to clouds, gladiator movies, old football clips, and time-lapse garbage, it is simply annoying.Pacino is Pacino - the agitated coach you expect.  Diaz does a good job at being the snotty brat - almost too good a job.  No one expects much from LL Cool J or Jamie Foxx, so we should not be disappointed there.  Luckily for them, acting takes a back seat here to camera angles, music and flash.Altogether, it gets old quickly.

Matthew Modine, for example, had most of his part end up on the  cutting room floor, I would bet.  Dennis Quaid probably did, too. I have  seen Dennis Quaid look better, by the way, in about any other  movie you  can name.  He is beginning to look more and more like his brother Randy. Oh  dear.This imbalance in their parts in this ensemble piece is more than  made up for by another stellar performance by the incredible Al Pacino, who  just keeps getting better and better as he gets older and older.  He will  blow you away as the coach of this uneven crew of messed up players at a  critical impasse in their career as a team.

From anti-war to anti-government to anti-media, he exposes the overlooked consequences of what makes us 'proud to be an American.'  In this movie, however, he seems to have lost something. 'Any Given Sunday' begins to reveal the violence and life threatening effects football can have on its players, but a Hollywood ending defeats any point.  Dennis Quaid plays an aging QB, whose body has been through so much his body can hardly function properly.  He doubts his ability to still perform, but thanks to his wife, who is more concerned with her own prestige than her husband's heath, he gives it one more go.  Is it worth risking your health and wellbeing after you've already accomplished so much?  But the really terrible part takes place between the coach, the team doctor, and an injured player.  After the coach fires the doc for not telling an injured player he's unfit to play, he tells the player, with a straight face, he can still play.  The coach has everything to gain (money, victory, prestige...) and only to lose a player's health.  Kind of sick how they think.  It's too bad the player doesn't get paralyzed.  At least then it would show that there are limitations that not even money can patch up.  Look at Muhammad Ali, one of the revolutionary thinkers of the 20th century whose full potential as a leader was cut short, or any retired pro-football player over 60- if you can find any seeing as that exceeds their life expectancy.

It's simply remarkable that this turned out to be a below-average film. Such a good cast, such a good director and such a good trailer. What could've gone wrong?An ageing football coach named Tony (Pacino) finds himself struggling with his personal and professional life while trying to hold his team together. A star quarterback has been knocked out of the game and a naive football player replaces him only to become exposed to the world of sports and become a danger to himself and to his players. Meanwhile, the coach finds himself constantly at battle with the team owner's money and power hungry daughter Christine (Cameron Diaz) intent on moving the team out.Any Given Sunday made a decent amount of money at the box office and movie-reviewers enjoyed it. However, if you look at it from a different perspective, Any Given Sunday is too flawed to be enjoyed and has a touch of decency which makes it a film that doesn't deserved to be universally panned. Luckily for the team on-screen and off-screen, this film got hardly any bad ratings, most people rated it as the average mediocre movie. I was one of them, but I found a lot of flaws in the script and timing. The characters weren't developed enough before they started screeching at each other, it's simply too long and I left the cinema with the headache. However, Any Given Sunday is sometimes quite exciting and the cast make it bearable enough for the lazy running time.Since the film is based on American football, it is mainly aimed at an American audience, which is unfortunate for eager New Zealander's. Oliver Stone's decision to go completely technical is sometimes acceptable, but to be honest, he needs to desperately measure up his game some time soon.",3,"Acceptable, but not something I'd see again.",984787200,"03 17, 2001",2001,1849,"['Given', 'SundayScore', '56/100What', 'great', 'looking', 'film', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'together', 'simply', 'remarkable', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'below-average', 'film', 'good', 'cast', 'good', 'director', 'good', 'trailer', 'What', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'wrong', 'ageing', 'football', 'coach', 'named', 'Tony', 'Pacino', 'struggling', 'personal', 'professional', 'life', 'trying', 'hold', 'team', 'together', 'A', 'star', 'quarterback', 'been', 'knocked', 'game', 'naive', 'football', 'player', 'only', 'become', 'exposed', 'world', 'sports', 'become', 'danger', 'players', 'Meanwhile', 'coach', 'constantly', 'battle', 'team', 'owner', 'money', 'power', 'hungry', 'daughter', 'Christine', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'intent', 'moving', 'team', 'out.Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'made', 'decent', 'amount', 'money', 'box', 'office', 'movie-reviewers', 'enjoyed', 'However', 'look', 'different', 'perspective', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'too', 'flawed', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'touch', 'decency', 'film', ""n't"", 'deserved', 'be', 'universally', 'panned', 'Luckily', 'team', 'on-screen', 'off-screen', 'film', 'got', 'hardly', 'bad', 'ratings', 'most', 'people', 'rated', 'average', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'found', 'lot', 'flaws', 'script', 'timing', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'developed', 'enough', 'started', 'screeching', 'other', 'simply', 'too', 'long', 'left', 'cinema', 'headache', 'However', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'exciting', 'cast', 'make', 'bearable', 'enough', 'lazy', 'running', 'time.Since', 'film', 'based', 'American', 'football', 'mainly', 'aimed', 'American', 'audience', 'unfortunate', 'eager', 'New', 'Zealander', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'decision', 'go', 'completely', 'technical', 'sometimes', 'acceptable', 'be', 'honest', 'desperately', 'measure', 'up', 'game', 'time', 'soon']",N/A

And still...I really loved this film!Al Pacino was the original attraction in this film for me.  Suffering through the down-side for the up-side of watching this great actor, who seems at home in any role, seemed do-able.  Pacino didn't disappoint in this film.  He was the personna of his character in all respects.  Nary a mis-step in his performance.However, I was then pleasantly surprised to enjoy the entire film.  I don't understand why this movie did not do better at the box office, particularly if it was viewed on the big screen, and considering how many football fans there are in the US and how many should have been drawn to this film.  Even to a non-football fan, the game footage was awesome in it's visuals.  The plot, panned apparently by most critics as tired and trite proved interesting.  It presented all facets of the world of Professional Football, which really don't interest me in my real life, but which were fascinating within the story.  The ideas of team-effort, loyalty, old versus new ideas, and reflections on life's choices in the retrospection of middle-age were thought-provoking, but not stodgy or over-dramatized.  The acting of Jamie Foxx was a pleasant surprise, indeed all the actors kept the movie moving and interesting, or perhaps that was the direction of Oliver Stone.  Perhaps in making not his BEST film, he finally made one that even his nonfans could enjoy.Enjoy it I did!

But unfortunately, the bits just don't add up.For some reason, it seems like the movie should've been able to thrive on just a few of these elements alone: Al Pacino and Camron Diaz play very memorable characters. Al Pacino is an old rugged loud-mouthed football coach, while Camron Diaz, the new team-owner, is a young and stylish, forward-looking businesswoman. The two actors are great, and when they're both on-screen, they have a sort of dissonance that has the potential to drive a great film. Their characters are further mirrored in the football team's old-timer and rookie stars. The old and the new are contrasted throughout the film, constantly shifting as the characters develop and the plot thickens. Add some intense football action, and how could you possibly go wrong?Well, apparently you can go wrong. The film's pace is clunky and inconsistent. The football scenes are shot and edited with the sort of intensity that you might see in Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan when they're invading the beach. However, these scenes just never end, it's as if Stone is simply trying to top previous sports films by pushing the envelope just a bit more - more sound, crunching, blood, yelling, aching, quick cuts, claustrophobic close-ups. He even goes so far as to use tiger growls for the athletes' grunts, and to make the injuries just all the more gory. After a while it's simply a mess - like listening to heavy metal for hours, it might be heavy stuff, but eventually it all starts sounding the same.In the end, the movie doesn't even really capture the excitement of football. I mean, he has animal noises coming out of players' mouths for godsake. Every now and then, a scene will address the strategy of the game. But overall, you never really see what makes Al Pacino such a great coach.And this is why the movie never quite holds together. It's more concerned with the hyper-realism of its football games than with its character development. Ultimately, the style is innovative, but movies don't thrive on just style alone - it has to serve a larger purpose. The pacing is simply lousy; it's as if the speed of plot development in Any Given Sunday is inversely proportional to the speed of the camera-shots on the football field.Overall the film simply has no vibe. Between the hyper-realism of the football scenes and the slow and pensive pace, the movie takes itself so seriously that you'd think you were watching a war-movie. But this is not from the characters being too devoted to the game; it's a result of poor choices when it came to screenwriting and editing.",2,less than the sum of its parts,1189814400,"09 15, 2007",2007,2705,"['movie', 'right', 'pieces', 'memorable', 'characters', 'hard-hitting', 'action', 'bit', 'philosophy', 'wisdom', 'unfortunately', 'bits', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up.For', 'reason', 'movie', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'thrive', 'just', 'few', 'elements', 'alone', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Camron', 'Diaz', 'play', 'very', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'old', 'rugged', 'loud-mouthed', 'football', 'coach', 'Camron', 'Diaz', 'new', 'team-owner', 'young', 'stylish', 'forward-looking', 'businesswoman', 'two', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'when', ""'re"", 'on-screen', 'have', 'sort', 'dissonance', 'potential', 'drive', 'great', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'further', 'mirrored', 'football', 'team', 'old-timer', 'rookie', 'stars', 'old', 'new', 'are', 'contrasted', 'film', 'constantly', 'shifting', 'characters', 'develop', 'plot', 'thickens', 'Add', 'intense', 'football', 'action', 'how', 'could', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'Well', 'apparently', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'film', 'pace', 'clunky', 'inconsistent', 'football', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'edited', 'sort', 'intensity', 'might', 'see', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'when', ""'re"", 'invading', 'beach', 'However', 'scenes', 'just', 'never', 'end', 'Stone', 'simply', 'trying', 'top', 'previous', 'sports', 'films', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'more', 'sound', 'crunching', 'blood', 'yelling', 'aching', 'quick', 'cuts', 'claustrophobic', 'close-ups', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'use', 'tiger', 'growls', 'athletes', 'grunts', 'make', 'injuries', 'just', 'more', 'gory', 'simply', 'mess', 'listening', 'heavy', 'metal', 'hours', 'might', 'be', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'eventually', 'sounding', 'same.In', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'capture', 'excitement', 'football', 'mean', 'animal', 'noises', 'coming', 'players', 'mouths', 'godsake', 'now', 'then', 'scene', 'will', 'address', 'strategy', 'game', 'overall', 'never', 'really', 'see', 'what', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'great', 'coach.And', 'why', 'movie', 'never', 'quite', 'together', 'more', 'concerned', 'hyper-realism', 'football', 'games', 'character', 'development', 'Ultimately', 'style', 'innovative', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'thrive', 'just', 'style', 'alone', 'serve', 'larger', 'purpose', 'pacing', 'simply', 'lousy', 'speed', 'plot', 'development', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'inversely', 'proportional', 'speed', 'camera-shots', 'football', 'film', 'simply', 'vibe', 'hyper-realism', 'football', 'scenes', 'slow', 'pensive', 'pace', 'movie', 'so', 'seriously', ""'d"", 'think', 'were', 'watching', 'war-movie', 'not', 'characters', 'being', 'too', 'devoted', 'game', 'result', 'poor', 'choices', 'when', 'came', 'screenwriting', 'editing']",N/A
120245,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,0790749912,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[0, 0]","Any Given Sunday is about the Miami Sharks football team and their struggle to make it to the top. The team is owned by Cameron Diaz, in quite possibly her fiercest role, as she takes no prisoners and is just as willing to hit her players as hire them. The coach is Al Pacino in a stereotypical Pacino role complete with scratchy voice, alcoholic tendencies, and volatile temper. Dennis Quaid plays the first-string quarterback who has spearheaded the team through so many good seasons that, even though he's injury plagued like Humpty Dumpty the team just keeps putting him back together again. When he's injured at the beginning of the season, the Sharks call out their second-string quarterback who is immediately injured too, and then they go to the bench for Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx). Beamen is so used to warming the bench that he barely knows the plays they're calling and he gets nauseated the first time he steps on the field. Still, after a few games he finds his stride and becomes the team's golden boy--nausea or no. Eventually he gets a bit big for his britches and starts talking down the defense, putting more powder up his nose than on it, and thinking that he doesn't have to listen to the coach, which Pacino hates of course.Any Given Sunday is fast-paced, hectic, and dramatic in the way that only Oliver Stone could make it. Cameron Diaz is my favorite character because she's so incredibly fierce that I can't believe she gets away with treating the people she does without any consequences. Jamie Foxx is perfect as the arrogant, cocky quarterback who of course can't be bothered to remember his humble days as a benchwarmer. One of the most hilarious moments of the film involves a commercial he films for MetRx complete with his own song, ""My name is Willie (Beamen),"" make sure to look out for it. Some of the supporting players include Lawrence Taylor as a defensive player who's been hit a few too many times, Ann-Margret as Diaz's liquored-up mother, and Lauren Holly as the first string quarterback's trophy wife who refuses to let her husband go down as a has-been. Overall, the cast is stellar and the direction is superb. Any Given Sunday is a must-see for anyone who enjoys sports movies that are fast-paced and dramatic without being sappy or overblown.",5,By far my favorite Oliver Stone film,1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,2290,"['Given', 'Sunday', 'Miami', 'Sharks', 'football', 'team', 'struggle', 'make', 'top', 'team', 'owned', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'quite', 'possibly', 'fiercest', 'role', 'prisoners', 'just', 'as', 'willing', 'hit', 'players', 'hire', 'coach', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'stereotypical', 'Pacino', 'role', 'complete', 'scratchy', 'voice', 'alcoholic', 'tendencies', 'volatile', 'temper', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'first-string', 'quarterback', 'who', 'spearheaded', 'team', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'seasons', 'even', 'injury', 'plagued', 'Humpty', 'Dumpty', 'team', 'just', 'putting', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'When', 'injured', 'beginning', 'season', 'Sharks', 'call', 'out', 'second-string', 'quarterback', 'who', 'immediately', 'injured', 'too', 'then', 'go', 'bench', 'Willie', 'Beamen', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Beamen', 'so', 'used', 'warming', 'bench', 'barely', 'plays', ""'re"", 'calling', 'nauseated', 'first', 'time', 'field', 'Still', 'few', 'games', 'stride', 'team', 'golden', 'boy', 'nausea', 'Eventually', 'bit', 'big', 'britches', 'talking', 'down', 'defense', 'putting', 'more', 'powder', 'nose', 'thinking', ""n't"", 'have', 'listen', 'coach', 'Pacino', 'hates', 'course.Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'fast-paced', 'hectic', 'dramatic', 'way', 'only', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'could', 'make', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'favorite', 'character', 'so', 'incredibly', 'fierce', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'away', 'treating', 'people', 'consequences', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'perfect', 'arrogant', 'cocky', 'quarterback', 'who', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'remember', 'humble', 'days', 'benchwarmer', 'One', 'most', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'film', 'commercial', 'MetRx', 'complete', 'own', 'song', 'name', 'Willie', 'Beamen', 'make', 'sure', 'look', 'out', 'supporting', 'players', 'include', 'Lawrence', 'Taylor', 'defensive', 'player', 'who', 'been', 'hit', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Ann-Margret', 'Diaz', 'liquored-up', 'mother', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'first', 'string', 'quarterback', 'trophy', 'wife', 'who', 'let', 'husband', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'has-been', 'Overall', 'cast', 'stellar', 'direction', 'superb', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'who', 'sports', 'movies', 'are', 'fast-paced', 'dramatic', 'being', 'sappy', 'overblown']",N/A

He's innovating and very controversial, as a filmaker should be.  His JFK and Natural Born Killers were Supurb!!  That being said, I didn't expect less from Any Given Sunday.  Sure, it's controversial and filled with violence, drugs, sex, and money.  Tell us something we DON'T know!  Football is full of &quot;prep talks&quot; and &quot;big money.&quot;  Sure it's nice to see and hear, but after that game, it means nothing.  The athletes played for years and yet their attention is ONLY focused on the big prep talk, that 15 minutes of energy filled tongue whipping and bam, the next morning they're doing what they're doing, irrelevant to what just happened and forgetting what they heard. So is true for this film.  Not only did I enjoyed the 3 hour experience, but I left the theatre psyched up.  The next morning, I can't remember what the hell I just saw. I rented and then bought this movie because of Mr. Stone.  I love his works and I can't leave out this one.  But I can't help feeling empty and slighted by this movie.  So much of it was MTV-type production: big and loud music, pretty sexy girls, drugs, and football.  The football scenes were second to the private introspective fight of the coach.  The coach: Brilliant performance.  Seen that, done it twice, go on.  That sums up Al Pacino's performance and character.  Go on to Cameron Diaz's tough owner character and performance.  A total non-believable yawner.  Ho-hum.  Major Leagues (the movie) was tons better.  At least THAT owner showed some nastiness and hate. The players are aren't acting, they are being themselves.

Bernabo,"[1, 1]","I am not surprised that the NFL passed on getting behind ""Any Given Sunday,"" because everybody in the Commissioner's office must be cringing at virtually every scene of the antics of these football players off camera.  ""North Dallas Forty"" is still the best football movie made to date, but I have to admit I am somewhat surprised that this film was not more impressive.  I would have thought that Oliver Stone filming football plays would be awesome.  But while he does try to give us a sense of how FAST the games in the NFL are played I found myself cringing every time there was a slow motion shot of a pass hanging forever in the air.  The drama of a pass play is seeing it develop, but if all you see is the ball you have no idea of who the ball is being thrown to, how well he is covered, or anything that makes the play exciting.  Stone pulls this gambit several times and it never works once.  The touchdown routines after the scores are choreographed better.  And do not even get me started about the bit with the eye...Off the playing field every character has their own clich&eacute;.  The whole subplot with Cameron Diaz as the team owner is painful (but no one is wasted more in this film than Ann-Margaret as her mom) and Lawrence Taylor's performance as a toned down version of himself nicknamed the ""Shark"" is negated by the melodramatic waiting question of what will happen if he is hit wrong.  Dennis Quaid tries to bring some poignancy to the final days of a once great quarterback, but unfortunately he has Lauren Holly as a psychotic wife.  The Dallas Knights have the ugliest football uniforms in the history of the known universe, but, hey, isn't that Johnny U. roaming the sidelines as their coach?  That sure is Jim Brown preaching the gospel of defense to his troops.  Then again, I liked Willie Beamon's game ritual (and the way it becomes taken as a sure sign of good things to come); Jamie Fox, ironically enough, ends up being one of the most realistic characters in the film.  Still, when the best scene in the film is coach Al Pacino's pep talk before the big game or the punch line that caps off the end credits, that is not really a great selling point for a football movie.  But at least that scene makes up for all the scenery chewing and maudlin reflections Pacino has to do throughout the rest of the movie.Oh, and did I mention that the clips from ""Ben-Hur"" keep going out of sequence?  Apparently Charlton Heston did not point that out when he did his cameo as the Commissioner.  But like most of the problems in this film, Oliver Stone covers it by distracting us with music or simply pumping the volume up on the soundtrack.

Not only did the story keep me glued to the screen for its full 157 minutes, but all the performances were excellent.Al Pacino, as the coach, was outstanding.  At 60 years old his face has the creases which add expression and depth to his performance, making me feel his every emotion.  Jamie Fox, cast as the new young overnight sensation has a role that demands he first be unsure and vulnerable, then cocky and insufferable, then political and, finally, repentant.  That's a tall order for a actor and he does it masterfully.The rest of the cast is full of star power.  Cameron Diaz is the young woman who has inherited the team from her father.  Ann Margaret is her alcoholic mother.  Dennis Quaid is an injured quarterback, LJ Cool is a football player, James Woods is the unscrupulous doctor, and even Charlton Heston plays a cameo role as the Commissioner.  And, of course, there are some real players who round out this cast.One of the criticisms of the film is that the sports action was difficult to follow because of the cinematographic effects using slow motion spinning of the football or the silhouettes of the men postured as if on a battlefield. But this not a football game to watch on TV.  This is a larger-than-life mythic tale of modern-day gladiators who push themselves past the line of good sense for fame, fortune, money and glory and the corporate interests and media hype that keep it all together.I loved this video completely and give it a high recommendation.

Stone's  goal here, is to show the audience life in the world of pro football, since  he already tackled wall street, the media, war and governmental conspiracy  (all far more successfully than here), it seems only natural that Stone  turn his cameras to the playing field.The NFL declined involvment in the  making of this film and ten minutes into it, it's not hard to understand  why.  When the team's quarterback (Dennis Quaid-underused in this film)  goes down he is screamed at and treated like a fool by the medics-any pro  football fan knows that this, right off the bat, is Stone taking liberties  in this &quot;real&quot; football story.

Between the  grinding rap music, the self indulgent and laughably inane symbolism (the  chariot racing intercut between Pacino and Jamie Foxx during an arguemnt is  absurd) we get subplot after subplot. We get Cameron Diaz's estranged  releationship with her mother, Dennis Quaid's abusive wife hits him and  tells him HE WILL NOT QUIT FOOTBALL!!!  James Woods is a snake of a medic  using a very unorthodox method of medicine on the players and so on and so  on.Stone would like to think all this interesting for the viewer, but  beyond hardcore football fans and teenagers, this movie is junk plain and  simple.  Any Given Sunday doesn't surprise the viewer once in its  proceedings, the ending is crystal clear and hour before it happens, Stone  even cops out here and throws a happy ending on the preceeding dismal 2  hours and 40 minutes. Aside from James Woods and a few funny qutotes from  his mouth, and one great shouting match between Diaz and Pacino, there is  nothing to enjoy here.

120258,A152C8GYY25HAH,0790749912,Matthew Horner,"[1, 3]","Loud, raucous, and at times indecipherable, Any Given Sunday is director Oliver Stone's best movie in years. After all, all of Stone's pictures are loud, raucous and at times indecipherable. Off hand, I can think of three kinds of movies that are supposed to be this way - action movies, war movies and football movies. This incisive look at a pro football team undergoing a make or break period is, in my opinion, the best picture about the game ever made.The movie opens in the middle of a game that is going badly for the Miami Sharks. The team is on a losing streak and really need a win. To make matters worse, star quarterback Jack Rooney [Dennis Quaid] suffers a major back injury. Coach Tony D'Amato [Al Pacino] has no choice but to send in third string quarterback, Willie Beaman [Jamie Foxx], who blows enough plays to cause the team to lose. Up in a posh sky box, owner and general manager Christina Pagniacci [Cameron Diaz] is furious. Christina's deceased father founded the team, and D'Amato has led it to many victorious seasons in his thirty years as coach. This means little to Christina, a ruthless businessperson, whose goal is to sell the franchise. She can't get top dollar for a losing team. There is not an ounce of sentimentality, much less sympathy, in this woman. By the next game, D'Amato has worked his magic on Beaman, who turns out to be a great football player after all. Success soon goes to his head, however, and he becomes an egotistical nightmare for the coach and the team. Rooney is trying to get well enough to return for the playoffs, but in his heart, he knows he's getting too old for the game. Another back injury could land him in a wheelchair permanently.There is much more to Any Given Sunday's story, but it is the movie's drive and the great acting that make it so good. Nobody can play a man in the twilight of his glory better than Al Pacino. Cameron Diaz is so good as the heartless Christina that she's almost scary. Jamie Foxx gives a career making performance as Willie Beaman, while LL Cool J is first-rate as Julian Washington, a star player who's had one concussion too many.The film has been criticized for the fast, jumpy edits involving the action on the field, though I really liked them. The idea is not to sit and watch football plays. The idea is to put the viewer on the field with the players, and Oliver Stone achieved this. These scenes are so intense that I came away feeling a bit bruised myself. There have also been complaints that the movie's producers couldn't get the NFL to cooperate. If the NFL had done so, the result would have been as squeak clean as the war movies the Department of Defense used to approved of. What Stone does is to portray the players as modern day gladiators. He also pulls no punches in dealing with the issues of money, fame and the abuse of power and of privilege. His Miami Sharks may not be representative of pro football on the whole, but the team does have problems and issues which often do occur in real life.",4,Oliver Stone's interesting take on pro football,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,3019,"['Loud', 'raucous', 'times', 'indecipherable', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'best', 'movie', 'years', 'Stone', 'pictures', 'are', 'loud', 'raucous', 'times', 'indecipherable', 'Off', 'hand', 'can', 'think', 'three', 'kinds', 'movies', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'way', 'action', 'movies', 'war', 'movies', 'football', 'movies', 'incisive', 'look', 'pro', 'football', 'team', 'undergoing', 'make', 'break', 'period', 'opinion', 'best', 'picture', 'game', 'ever', 'made.The', 'movie', 'middle', 'game', 'going', 'badly', 'Miami', 'Sharks', 'team', 'losing', 'streak', 'really', 'need', 'win', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'star', 'quarterback', 'Jack', 'Rooney', '[', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', ']', 'major', 'back', 'injury', 'Coach', 'Tony', ""D'Amato"", '[', 'Al', 'Pacino', ']', 'choice', 'send', 'third', 'string', 'quarterback', 'Willie', 'Beaman', '[', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', ']', 'who', 'enough', 'plays', 'cause', 'team', 'lose', 'Up', 'posh', 'sky', 'box', 'owner', 'general', 'manager', 'Christina', 'Pagniacci', '[', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', ']', 'furious', 'Christina', 'deceased', 'father', 'founded', 'team', ""D'Amato"", 'led', 'many', 'victorious', 'seasons', 'thirty', 'years', 'coach', 'little', 'Christina', 'ruthless', 'businessperson', 'goal', 'sell', 'franchise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'top', 'dollar', 'losing', 'team', 'not', 'ounce', 'sentimentality', 'much', 'less', 'sympathy', 'woman', 'next', 'game', ""D'Amato"", 'worked', 'magic', 'Beaman', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'great', 'football', 'player', 'Success', 'soon', 'head', 'however', 'egotistical', 'nightmare', 'coach', 'team', 'Rooney', 'trying', 'get', 'well', 'enough', 'return', 'playoffs', 'heart', 'getting', 'too', 'old', 'game', 'back', 'injury', 'could', 'land', 'wheelchair', 'much', 'more', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'story', 'movie', 'drive', 'great', 'acting', 'make', 'so', 'good', 'Nobody', 'can', 'play', 'man', 'twilight', 'glory', 'better', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'so', 'good', 'heartless', 'Christina', 'almost', 'scary', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'career', 'making', 'performance', 'Willie', 'Beaman', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'first-rate', 'Julian', 'Washington', 'star', 'player', 'who', 'had', 'one', 'concussion', 'too', 'many.The', 'film', 'been', 'criticized', 'fast', 'jumpy', 'edits', 'involving', 'action', 'field', 'really', 'liked', 'idea', 'not', 'sit', 'watch', 'football', 'plays', 'idea', 'put', 'viewer', 'field', 'players', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'achieved', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'intense', 'came', 'away', 'feeling', 'bit', 'bruised', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'complaints', 'movie', 'producers', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'NFL', 'cooperate', 'NFL', 'had', 'done', 'so', 'result', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'squeak', 'clean', 'war', 'movies', 'Department', 'Defense', 'used', 'approved', 'What', 'Stone', 'portray', 'players', 'modern', 'day', 'gladiators', 'also', 'punches', 'dealing', 'issues', 'money', 'fame', 'abuse', 'power', 'privilege', 'Miami', 'Sharks', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'representative', 'pro', 'football', 'whole', 'team', 'have', 'problems', 'issues', 'often', 'do', 'occur', 'real', 'life']",N/A

Although the hour or so of in-your-face American football footage is hypnotic, thrilling, scary and technically astounding, the off-field conflicts offer the same old tired sports cliches, albeit with big names and Stone's eccentric camerawork.The first half hour of the film is almost a mini masterpiece. Sticking the audience smack in the middle of a ferocious game of American footbal, he brilliantly orchestrates frenetic, muddy, bloody, bone-crunching MTV visuals in a Natural Born Killers vein, and introduces the stressed protagonists. There's explosive coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), cynical owner Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz), dedicated star player 'Cap' Rooney (Dennis Quaid) and self-important star player to-be Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx).  When Rooney receives a major injury, Beaman is thrust into the spotlight and begins to show his potential. As his quarterback skills improve and the team seems destined for a play-off place, his arrogant disregard for the rest of the team causes majoy ructions. Meanwhile, Tony and Christina's major hate-hate relationship worsens.There's a handful of other subplots too, which you could probably write yourself and the fine supporting cast - James Woods, Matthew Modine and Aaron Eckhart - are criminally underused. The behind-the-scenes drama is decently performed, but it seems so flat and pedestrian compared to the explosive games, that you find yourself willing on the next touchdown. Pacino is energetic as usual, even if he is in shouty auto-pilot, Foxx is almost Oscar-worthy in a memorable performance, and Diaz is pretty amazing, it is good to see the actress playing different roles, as her character, Christina Pagniacci is a cold-hearted bitchy business woman, and Diaz usally plays blonde sweet-hearts.It would seem that the character-and-plot driven days of Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July are long gone for Oliver Stone.

120268,A1W1ONKNMIHP99,0790749912,MrSherlockHolmes,"[2, 4]","I'm not a football fan. In fact all I know about the game is that there is a ball that must be moved from one end of a rectangular field to the other. Stone decided to draw parallels between this modern game and the gladiators in Ancient Rome. The suggestions were anything but subtle, what with the grunting, clashing sounds, the numerous shots of Ben Hur and the actual references in the film you couldn't help but notice.Although this movie is ostensibly about football, I came away from it learning a bit more about life. The movie is about an old coach (Al Pacino) whose love of the game has blinded him to life's real pleasures, an injured QB (Quaid) who is easily manipulated by others to continue playing even if it is detrimental to his health. The daughter (Diaz) of a dead football `baron', who seeks to fulfill her father's lost hope for a son, and a rising star (Foxx) who is blind to everything but his own gratification. From these cast of characters Stone creates drama.This movie is exciting even for those, like me, who aren't too interested in football. The game scenes seem more like gladiatorial battles than actual football games, and you are left wondering if we have really changed from those Romans thousands of years ago, the way `we' love these slugfests.As some earlier reviewers mentioned, Stone appears to be slightly biased in his portrayal of the management of these teams. They are definitely out to make money, but I doubt they are as ruthless as they were made out to be.

Garrard ""the G-man""","[3, 5]","As my title indicates, I'm not the biggest football fan; however, I found Oliver Stone's film to be totally engrossing, due mostly to the outstanding performances from all involved. That, along with the movie's entertaining musical soundtrack, makes this film a must-see for all.In regards to the acting, ""Any Given Sunday"" shows a variety of talent, experience, along with stars-in-the-making. Jamie Foxx is an example of the latter. His performance as brash, young, third-string-quarterback ""Willie Beaman"", brought into the limelight after injuries sustained by veteran Dennis Quaid, is the perfect showcase for the actor's emerging skills. It is no wonder that Foxx won an Oscar this year and he deserved a nomination for AGS.Cameron Diaz, as the general manager of the fictional Miami Sharks, is quite good as a woman in charge of a male-dominated position. She holds her own with the more seasoned performers that populate this dynamic film.Quaid gives another underrated performance as the washed-up quarterback with one more good game to play. James Woods, one of the best character actors today, delivers another flawless job as the seedy team doctor. Matthew Modine, L.L. Cool J, and Aaron Eckhart match him in other supporting roles.Though her role is small, Lauren Holly gets some points for her performance as Quaid's supportive and determined wife.Actor/songwriter Clifton Davis (one of the stars of the 80's sitcom ""Amen"" and composer of The Jackson Five's ""Never Can Say Goodbye"") has a moment in the sun as the mayor of Miami.Football legends Jim Brown and Lawrence Taylor are effective in their roles of assistant coach and veteran linesman, respectively.Smaller roles are assayed by legends Ann-Margret (cast as Diaz's mother and widow of the team's former owner) and Charlton Heston as the football commissioner. As a tribute to the actor, as well as providing a fitting comparison between football's modern-day gladiators to those of ancient times, a montage of scenes from ""Ben-Hur"" are intertwined between events unfolding in the film's story.But the movie belongs to Al Pacino, an actor of unparalleled talent that immerses himself in the role of the ""old school"" coach that must make deal with a changing sports world and the traditions that he holds so dearly. When his ""Tony D'Amato"" cries, so does the audience. When he is frustrated at the team's loss, the audience feels that frustration. When he experiences joy, that feeling is shared by all.If Stone hadn't had such a mixed track record of hits and misses, an Oscar might be on Pacino's shelf, for he surely deserved one for this film.",4,A football movie for those not into football!,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,2618,"['title', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'football', 'fan', 'however', 'found', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'film', 'be', 'totally', 'engrossing', 'due', 'mostly', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'involved', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'must-see', 'all.In', 'regards', 'acting', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'variety', 'talent', 'experience', 'stars-in-the-making', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'example', 'latter', 'performance', 'brash', 'young', 'third-string-quarterback', 'Willie', 'Beaman', 'brought', 'limelight', 'injuries', 'sustained', 'veteran', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'perfect', 'showcase', 'actor', 'emerging', 'skills', 'wonder', 'Foxx', 'won', 'Oscar', 'year', 'deserved', 'nomination', 'AGS.Cameron', 'Diaz', 'general', 'manager', 'fictional', 'Miami', 'Sharks', 'quite', 'good', 'woman', 'charge', 'male-dominated', 'position', 'own', 'more', 'seasoned', 'performers', 'populate', 'dynamic', 'film.Quaid', 'underrated', 'performance', 'washed-up', 'quarterback', 'one', 'more', 'good', 'game', 'play', 'James', 'Woods', 'one', 'best', 'character', 'actors', 'today', 'flawless', 'job', 'seedy', 'team', 'doctor', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'L.L', 'Cool', 'J', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'match', 'other', 'supporting', 'role', 'small', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'points', 'performance', 'Quaid', 'supportive', 'determined', 'wife.Actor/songwriter', 'Clifton', 'Davis', 'one', 'stars', '80', 'sitcom', 'Amen', 'composer', 'Jackson', 'Five', 'Never', 'Can', 'Say', 'Goodbye', 'moment', 'sun', 'mayor', 'Miami.Football', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'Lawrence', 'Taylor', 'are', 'effective', 'roles', 'assistant', 'coach', 'veteran', 'linesman', 'respectively.Smaller', 'roles', 'are', 'assayed', 'legends', 'Ann-Margret', 'cast', 'Diaz', 'mother', 'widow', 'team', 'former', 'owner', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'football', 'commissioner', 'tribute', 'actor', 'as', 'well', 'providing', 'fitting', 'comparison', 'football', 'modern-day', 'gladiators', 'ancient', 'times', 'montage', 'scenes', 'Ben-Hur', 'are', 'intertwined', 'events', 'unfolding', 'film', 'story.But', 'movie', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'actor', 'unparalleled', 'talent', 'role', 'old', 'school', 'coach', 'must', 'make', 'deal', 'changing', 'sports', 'world', 'traditions', 'so', 'dearly', 'When', 'Tony', ""D'Amato"", 'cries', 'so', 'audience', 'When', 'frustrated', 'team', 'loss', 'audience', 'feels', 'frustration', 'When', 'joy', 'feeling', 'shared', 'all.If', 'Stone', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'such', 'mixed', 'track', 'record', 'hits', 'misses', 'Oscar', 'might', 'be', 'Pacino', 'shelf', 'surely', 'deserved', 'one', 'film']",N/A

120277,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0790749912,Reviewer,"[2, 5]","It's not if you win or lose, it's how you play the game.  Football as a metaphor for life; you have to fight for every inch, on the field, as in life.  Or perhaps on the ""playing"" field that ""is"" life.  Take your pick, you get the idea; whatever you choose you can bet it's a concept director Oliver Stone apparently seems to think he originated in his over-long, self-indulgent miasma ""Any Given Sunday,"" starring Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz and Dennis Quaid.  A decent movie?  Yes.  Original?  No.  Stone pulls out every cliche in the book, twists it all like so much play dough to put his own spin on it and serves it up like so many hot dogs you can buy at the stadium while you watch his fictitious Miami Sharks play.  The recipe for this particular potpourri includes the quarterback willing to play-through-the-pain-for-the-team; the third-stringer whose success goes to his head; discrimination; locker room scene after locker room scene that play like, well, locker room scenes; players with names like ""Madman,"" ""Beastman,"" ""J-Man,"" ""Shark"" and ""Cap;"" a ruthless, young General Manager/owner who inherited the position from her father; the unethical team physician whose diagnoses of injured players coincide with the needs of the team; the young, ethical assistant team physician; and the legendary coach who just wants to inspire his team and win one more.  The title of this film could have been ""Any Given Sports Film.""  All of which may seem contradictory after stating that this is a ""decent"" film.  Perhaps.  But understand that by decent I mean that this movie was, if nothing else, a professional endeavor that was packaged and delivered in a way you would expect from the star-studded cast Stone assembled here.  The problem lies with Stone, whose work on this project fairly rings of arrogance and self aggrandizement.  All of the aforementioned ""potpourri"" ingredients, for instance, are actually legitimate aspects of this story; but in Stone's hands the legitimate comes across as cliche, while any attempt at profundity seems merely pretentious.  His endless use of slow motion photography during the game sequences ultimately has a nullifying effect on the drama it is, I assume, meant to enhance; and it's a perfect example of the excesses he allowed himself that give this movie the sense of pretending to be something it is not.  It's a case of the artist who is too close to his work being given too much freedom, or in this case, enough rope with which to hang himself.  Pacino is a star, always larger than life, with an incomparable screen presence from whom we've come to expect a certain quality of performance.  And here, as Coach Tony D'Amato, he certainly does not disappoint.  That his character lacks originality is not his fault; it's the part he was given and he makes the most of it.  To his credit he keeps him interesting, even though this is a guy you've seen a number of times in just as many movies.  Cameron Diaz does not fare as well; she simply was not given the time necessary to develop her character, Christina Pagniacci (The time was available, but Stone chose to use it for yet nine or ten more slow-mo close-ups of a hand reaching, reaching, reaching for a football prominently featuring the ""Wilson"" brand), and Dennis Quaid fell victim as well with his portrayal of Cap Rooney.  Jamie Foxx fared as well as anyone involved as third-string quarterback Willie Beamen, and there are some notable supporting performances from Lawrence Taylor (Shark), LL Cool J (J-Man) James Woods (Dr. Mandrake), Matthew Modine (Dr. Powers) and Ann-Margret (Margaret Pagniacci).  Charlton Heston, however, is wasted in a cameo as the Commissioner of the League.  Some would say you do not necessarily have to like football to like this movie; that may be true.  Subjectively, I would say that to like this movie at all, you must approach it with very low expectations (and it certainly wouldn't hurt if you did like football).  As I see it, with ""Any Given Sunday"" Oliver Stone lowered the bar and allowed himself to step over the line, which is especially disappointing in light of the fact that this is the director who gave us such excellent, thought-provoking films as ""Platoon,"" ""JFK,"" and ""Born On The Fourth Of July.""  And in the future, I'm sure he'll add more titles to that list; unfortunately, this film will not be one of them.",2,&quot;Any Given Sports Film&quot;,978566400,"01 4, 2001",2001,4374,"['not', 'win', 'lose', 'how', 'play', 'game', 'Football', 'metaphor', 'life', 'have', 'fight', 'inch', 'field', 'life', 'perhaps', 'playing', 'field', 'life', 'Take', 'pick', 'get', 'idea', 'choose', 'can', 'bet', 'concept', 'director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'apparently', 'think', 'originated', 'over-long', 'self-indulgent', 'miasma', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'starring', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'decent', 'movie', 'Yes', 'Original', 'No', 'Stone', 'out', 'cliche', 'book', 'so', 'much', 'play', 'dough', 'put', 'own', 'spin', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'hot', 'dogs', 'can', 'buy', 'stadium', 'watch', 'fictitious', 'Miami', 'Sharks', 'play', 'recipe', 'particular', 'potpourri', 'quarterback', 'willing', 'play-through-the-pain-for-the-team', 'third-stringer', 'success', 'head', 'discrimination', 'room', 'scene', 'locker', 'room', 'scene', 'play', 'well', 'locker', 'room', 'scenes', 'players', 'names', 'Madman', 'Beastman', 'J-Man', 'Shark', 'Cap', 'ruthless', 'young', 'General', 'Manager/owner', 'who', 'inherited', 'position', 'father', 'unethical', 'team', 'physician', 'diagnoses', 'injured', 'players', 'coincide', 'needs', 'team', 'young', 'ethical', 'assistant', 'team', 'physician', 'legendary', 'coach', 'who', 'just', 'inspire', 'team', 'win', 'one', 'more', 'title', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sports', 'Film', 'may', 'seem', 'contradictory', 'stating', 'decent', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'understand', 'decent', 'mean', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'professional', 'endeavor', 'was', 'packaged', 'delivered', 'way', 'would', 'expect', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'Stone', 'assembled', 'here', 'problem', 'Stone', 'work', 'project', 'fairly', 'rings', 'arrogance', 'self', 'aggrandizement', 'aforementioned', 'potpourri', 'ingredients', 'instance', 'are', 'actually', 'legitimate', 'aspects', 'story', 'Stone', 'legitimate', 'cliche', 'attempt', 'profundity', 'merely', 'pretentious', 'endless', 'use', 'slow', 'motion', 'photography', 'game', 'ultimately', 'nullifying', 'effect', 'drama', 'assume', 'meant', 'enhance', 'perfect', 'example', 'excesses', 'allowed', 'give', 'movie', 'sense', 'pretending', 'be', 'something', 'not', 'case', 'artist', 'who', 'too', 'close', 'work', 'being', 'given', 'too', 'much', 'freedom', 'case', 'enough', 'rope', 'hang', 'Pacino', 'star', 'always', 'larger', 'life', 'incomparable', 'screen', 'presence', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'certain', 'quality', 'performance', 'here', 'Coach', 'Tony', ""D'Amato"", 'certainly', 'not', 'disappoint', 'character', 'lacks', 'originality', 'not', 'fault', 'part', 'was', 'given', 'most', 'credit', 'interesting', 'even', 'guy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'number', 'times', 'just', 'many', 'movies', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'not', 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'simply', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'time', 'necessary', 'develop', 'character', 'Christina', 'Pagniacci', 'time', 'was', 'available', 'Stone', 'chose', 'use', 'yet', 'nine', 'ten', 'more', 'slow-mo', 'close-ups', 'hand', 'reaching', 'reaching', 'reaching', 'football', 'prominently', 'featuring', 'Wilson', 'brand', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'fell', 'victim', 'as', 'well', 'portrayal', 'Cap', 'Rooney', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'fared', 'as', 'well', 'anyone', 'involved', 'third-string', 'quarterback', 'Willie', 'Beamen', 'are', 'notable', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Lawrence', 'Taylor', 'Shark', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'J-Man', 'James', 'Woods', 'Dr.', 'Mandrake', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'Dr', 'Powers', 'Ann-Margret', 'Margaret', 'Pagniacci', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'however', 'wasted', 'cameo', 'Commissioner', 'League', 'would', 'say', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'have', 'like', 'football', 'like', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'Subjectively', 'would', 'say', 'like', 'movie', 'must', 'approach', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'did', 'like', 'football', 'see', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'lowered', 'bar', 'allowed', 'step', 'line', 'especially', 'disappointing', 'light', 'fact', 'director', 'who', 'gave', 'such', 'excellent', 'thought-provoking', 'films', 'Platoon', 'JFK', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'future', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'add', 'more', 'titles', 'list', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'one']",N/A

120280,A1MIFU0YKLG40T,0790749912,Rick Galati,"[0, 0]","I like Oliver Stone. On the whole, I do enjoy his directorial style but he has a tendency to belabor a given point. ""Any Given Sunday"" was a fair football movie that could have been a great sports film if skillfully edited to a more reasonable 2 hour length. Aside from its bladder busting 157 minute endurance, it was a fairly entertaining study of modern day football not too far removed in attitude and tone from ""North Dallas Forty"". But times as they say are a changing and Stone addressed the new economic realities of creative stadium financing, a new breed of athlete acutely aware of lucrative endorsement possibilities that go hand in hand with success on the gridiron, and Stone played the ""race card"" to some clever advantage. Comedian Jamie Foxx was wonderful in his dramatic turn as a third string quarterback who suddenly finds himself the object of media and public attention as surprise replacement to ""Cap"" Rooney, the injured, aging star of the Miami Sharks, nicely defined by Dennis Quaid. As veteran head coach Tony D'Amato, Al Pacino was given carte blanche to let fly with his signature fiery bombast at times directed to players individually or collectively, the franchise ownership (Cameron Diaz), the team doctor (James Woods) or anyone else who crossed his purposes. The remaining cast was rounded out superbly with a host of wonderful performances including but certainly not limited to Jim Brown, Ann-Margret, Lauren Holly, Charlton Heston as the Commissioner, and Clifton Davis as a shrewd big city mayor. On the whole I'd say this was an entertaining and sometimes provocative glimpse into the world of professional sports and big time American pop culture on any given Sunday afternoon.",3,Stone' s Throw,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",2004,1718,"['like', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'whole', 'do', 'enjoy', 'directorial', 'style', 'tendency', 'belabor', 'given', 'point', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'was', 'fair', 'football', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'sports', 'film', 'skillfully', 'edited', 'more', 'reasonable', '2', 'hour', 'length', 'Aside', 'bladder', 'busting', '157', 'minute', 'endurance', 'was', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'study', 'modern', 'day', 'football', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'attitude', 'tone', 'North', 'Dallas', 'Forty', 'times', 'say', 'are', 'changing', 'Stone', 'addressed', 'new', 'economic', 'realities', 'creative', 'stadium', 'financing', 'new', 'breed', 'athlete', 'acutely', 'aware', 'lucrative', 'endorsement', 'possibilities', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'success', 'gridiron', 'Stone', 'played', 'race', 'card', 'clever', 'advantage', 'Comedian', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'was', 'wonderful', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'third', 'string', 'quarterback', 'who', 'suddenly', 'object', 'media', 'public', 'attention', 'surprise', 'replacement', 'Cap', 'Rooney', 'injured', 'aging', 'star', 'Miami', 'Sharks', 'nicely', 'defined', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'veteran', 'head', 'coach', 'Tony', ""D'Amato"", 'Al', 'Pacino', 'was', 'given', 'carte', 'blanche', 'let', 'fly', 'signature', 'fiery', 'bombast', 'times', 'directed', 'players', 'individually', 'collectively', 'franchise', 'ownership', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'team', 'doctor', 'James', 'Woods', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'crossed', 'purposes', 'remaining', 'cast', 'was', 'rounded', 'out', 'superbly', 'host', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'including', 'certainly', 'not', 'limited', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'Ann-Margret', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Commissioner', 'Clifton', 'Davis', 'shrewd', 'big', 'city', 'mayor', 'whole', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'entertaining', 'sometimes', 'provocative', 'glimpse', 'world', 'professional', 'sports', 'big', 'time', 'American', 'pop', 'culture', 'given', 'Sunday', 'afternoon']",N/A

Cameron Diaz is horribly miscast...she gets to cuss and act mean, but to what purpose other than to be the character that represents ""young, money-hungry, tradition-despising business people of today."" Lauren Holly...what the heck was that character?!?! And Pacino, who can be good, is allowed to indulge in all his mannerisms, but to no purpose. I kept expecting a line like ""I try to get out of football...but they always pull me back.""I enjoyed some of the more minor characters a bit more...some of the young football players were really well done.

120282,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0790749912,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Any Given Sunday (Oliver Stone, 1999)[originally posted 27Dec1999]Forget the well-written script, forget the acting, forget Oliver Stone's best direction work in years, forget an almost-perfect ensemble cast, forget gorgeous (if overdone) cinematography, forget perfect sound. Well, don't forget it, I guess, because we'll come back to it, but put it in the back of your head for a while. The true star of Any Given Sunday is the incredible choreography. A good deal of this movie takes place on the gridiron itself as twenty-two men pound each other into submission every Sunday. Bones strain and crack, blood flows, muscles and ligaments tear, and it's all captured oh so lovingly on film. It's difficult to watch for a non-football fan like myself (don't know any football fans who have seen it yet, so can't comment), but even while flinching at the sound of a body hitting the ground after being battered by two even bigger bodies in midair, it's still visually stunning. Just the football scenes alone would be enough to lift this movie to above-average status.That said, Any Given Sunday just plain rocks. It's the story of a whole lot of seemingly morally bankrupt people whose lives have been negatively affected by football. Coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino) has been with the Miami Sharks since their beginnings, and quarterback Cap Rooney (Dennis Quaid) has been there with him for well over half the team's existence. But Rooney is thirty-eight, well beyond the normal end of career for a football quarterback, and as should be expected, he goes down one too many times and screws something up in his chest. String 2 QB goes down after one play with a knee injury. That leaves D'Amato's third and last hope, a benchwarmer named Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx). Beamen ignores the playbook, calls his own plays, and turns the team around. Of course, in favoring one receiver and trash-talking (deservedly, it should be noted) the team's defensive line, he makes a whole lot of enemies inside the club, with the expected results. Add to this shortlist the team founder's widow (Ann-Margaret), an alcoholic whose sole desire is to get away form the game, and daughter (Cameron Diaz), the team's present GM, who also wants to get away from the game, but with as much money as she can get for selling the team.Despite the fact that every one of these folks gives an excellent performance (save the woefully miscast Diaz, who does the best she can with her role), the one person in this film who truly shines in the role of ""person whose personality has been completely warped by football"" is Cap Rooney's trophy wife, Cindy (Lauren Holly). The woman is a flaming, gold-plated, iron-balled, moneygrubbing psycho bitch from hell, and Holly plays the role to the hilt. This leads me to believe that switching Diaz and Holly would have been in the best interests of the film; Holly would have made a great shady GM. But you play with what you got.Another person to single out is Jamie Foxx, who's always been relegated to minor comedic roles before this. Stone threw him in with the big boys here, and many of them (Pacino, Quaid, James Woods and Matt Modine as the team's orthopedists, etc.). Foxx holds his own. It's not an Oscar-caliber performance, but Foxx shows he's more than capable of playing a dramatic role and playing it well. Hopefully this will be the breakout role for Foxx. He's helped by a minor cast and a bunch of football-related cameos who obviously love being here. None of them looked familiar to me, save James Brown (yes, the guy from The World's Funniest) as the defensive coach for the Sharks and football great Lawrence ""L.T."" Taylor as a rival coach who spends more time taunting Pacino than he does coaching his own team.As for Stone, what's he doing here? Maybe he finally realized what the rest of the world did, that he went way off the deep end after Platoon. If this is his attempt at atonement, he bought himself a few centuries' worth of indulgence. The politics here are the politics of teamwork, aside from a minor subplot with Cameron Diaz soaking Miami's mayor for money for a new stadium. There are no ludicrous conspiracies, no embittered war veterans, no high-profile politicians to be ridiculed, only a bunch of people who have been pushed to the limit by a sport. It's The Godfather without the Mafia, and Stone handles it as capably as he's handled anything. The style is the same-- lots of darkness, gloom, and somewhat glorified violence-- but it's nice to see it applied to something nonpolitical for the first time since his highly-underrated horror classic The Hand.So having praised it to the high heavens, what's wrong with the movie? Why isn't it the greatest film of all time? A few minor things, mostly. I've already mentioned Diaz. And some of the cinematography-- if you cut out all of the slow-motion long bomb passes except for the first one, the movie might have been fifteen minutes shorter (and it runs well over two and a half hours). The soundtrack, while oddly effective, gets annoying after a while; you hear a lot of songs, and it's a great mix of stuff spanning the sixties to Kid Rock's most recent single, but you never hear more than a few seconds of any song. Even the now-banned ""Rock and Roll Part Two"" gets a few bars early on.Excellent filmmaking, especially when held up against the last seventeen years of Oliver Stone's career. ****",4,When We Were

120283,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,0790749912,Robert Blake,"[2, 4]","Oliver Stone returns with &quot;Any Given Sunday,&quot; which is probably the best football movie ever made. Stone, using his usual visual brilliance  and complex writing style, creates a movie that is fun but effective,  intelligent and sometimes thoughtful. There are ideas here. What Stone does  is make a movie about football where the characters are just as important  as the action going on in the field. We care just as much about the  characters than the game. This is Stone's best film since  &quot;Nixon.&quot; He's usually known for political, provocative and  satirical masterpieces like &quot;JFK,&quot; &quot;Natural Born  Killers,&quot; &quot;Nixon&quot; and &quot;Talk Radio,&quot; but here he  examines the sports industry and perfectly exploits how football has become  some sort of religion in our society. He also examines the elements of the  athlete and what an athlete goes through in life. This isn't some boring  chicken job where the director is afraid to explore real issues about the  sports world and show some of it's less-popular or glamorous realities.  Stone is a director not afraid to take chances, and that's why I admire  him. In &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; he also pumps up the volume with a  rock/rap soundtrack and bone-crunching sports sequences. He doesn't just  show us a game, he takes us INTO a game.

120284,A38G64S5VMRI1P,0790749912,Robert Graves,"[2, 6]","Maybe after coming off the Super bowl high of watching Tom Brady and the Patriots win for the second time in three years I was expecting more from ""Any Given Sunday."" Everything seemed to line up - the cast, with Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid and James Woods; the director and writer Oliver Stone; the concept, a behind the scenes look at the NFL under the fictional guise of the American Football Association. Unfortunately, all these promising pieces added up to a nothing more than every sports clich&eacute; in the past thirty years of filmmaking crammed into one movie.The story is really Pacino's, as the aging Coach of the Miami Sharks (clever twist in the Dolphins, huh?) facing the challenges of a changing league. His owner has recently died, leaving the unbelievably obnoxious Diaz as the current Owner, always breathing down his neck and forcing her uninformed will upon him. Owner is concerned with television ratings, possibly moving the franchise - tons of other motives other than winning games. Coach is also trying to manage Foxx as the Young Hot Shot. Young Hot Shot has recently come on the scene when the Old Star (Quaid) was injured. Coach and Old Star are of course very close and belong to the same philosophy, but Young Hot Shot is taking over the game with every play, ignoring Coach's plays and doing his own play-calling - but succeeding. So Coach has a dilemma - when the playoffs start does he go with Young Hot Shot, who the cameras (and Owner) love, or with the tried and true methods of Old Star?Well, Young Hot Shot has isolated himself from the rest of the team with his brash comments and rise to a household name (in all of about three games). So Coach goes with the unconfident Old Star in the first game of the playoffs. But all the while Young Hot Shot has been learning his lesson, quietly nodding in understanding during Coach's rousing halftime speeches. So when the time comes and Old Star is again injured, Young Hot Shot is ready to step in. By this time, though, Coach has accepted Young Hot Shot's unruly methods and allows him to just go for it, and they of course, win the game.Sound familiar? It should. It's the plot of about every sports film ever made. We don't even need actual names to describe it. I expected so much more from Stone. In an attempt to show what pro sports is  ""really"" like, he apparently thought the story wouldn't matter. We focus on almost everything but football - the egos of the characters, the ulterior motives of the owner, the inaccurate news reporting - but not football. The games are reduced to darkened, rainy war scenes, with people loosing eyes (literally), front flips over defenders, and someone getting injured on almost every play.Whether or not football is actually the way Stone depicts it, he did not paint a convincing picture whatsoever. Essentially, the owner cares *nothing* for the players, the coaches clear players to play when they are one hit away from having an aneurism, and the players intentionally don't block on the front line because they don't like their quarterback. Sorry. I don't buy it. Stone paints the league as a dark, depressing, unforgiving torture chamber, with games no more sophisticated than a fourth-grade scramble in the park. Football is the most complex game on the planet - why not show even a little bit of that? Instead of the Carolina Panthers and New England Patriots - who chose to have themselves introduced as a team rather than individuals - we get the tough to swallow Miami Sharks, who all *hate* each other. A team like this would never make the playoffs - never. And then, to make it even worse, all of this is thrown together in a horrendous MTV-style montage. The movie is edited like a commercial - it just feels like a collection of scenes, not a movie.I do not recommend this film, especially if you love football and are hoping for a good sports movie. It's a war film in the costume of a sports film, and apparently Stone doesn't think the audience is intelligent enough to understand this for themselves, because he includes scene after scene of gladiators fighting in the coliseum, ramming the analogy down the viewer's throat. He should stick to the war/crime movies, and stop trying to impose the genre on innocent films.",2,Any given sports movie,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,4294,"['Maybe', 'coming', 'off', 'Super', 'bowl', 'high', 'watching', 'Tom', 'Brady', 'Patriots', 'win', 'second', 'time', 'three', 'years', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'Everything', 'seemed', 'line', 'up', 'cast', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'James', 'Woods', 'director', 'writer', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'concept', 'scenes', 'look', 'NFL', 'fictional', 'guise', 'American', 'Football', 'Association', 'Unfortunately', 'promising', 'pieces', 'added', 'up', 'nothing', 'more', 'sports', 'clich', 'eacute', 'past', 'thirty', 'years', 'filmmaking', 'crammed', 'one', 'movie.The', 'story', 'really', 'Pacino', 'aging', 'Coach', 'Miami', 'Sharks', 'clever', 'twist', 'Dolphins', 'huh', 'facing', 'challenges', 'changing', 'league', 'owner', 'recently', 'died', 'leaving', 'unbelievably', 'obnoxious', 'Diaz', 'current', 'Owner', 'always', 'breathing', 'down', 'neck', 'forcing', 'uninformed', 'will', 'upon', 'Owner', 'concerned', 'television', 'ratings', 'possibly', 'moving', 'franchise', 'tons', 'other', 'motives', 'other', 'winning', 'games', 'Coach', 'also', 'trying', 'manage', 'Foxx', 'Young', 'Hot', 'Shot', 'Young', 'Hot', 'Shot', 'recently', 'come', 'scene', 'when', 'Old', 'Star', 'Quaid', 'was', 'injured', 'Coach', 'Old', 'Star', 'are', 'course', 'very', 'close', 'belong', 'same', 'philosophy', 'Young', 'Hot', 'Shot', 'taking', 'over', 'game', 'play', 'ignoring', 'Coach', 'plays', 'doing', 'own', 'play-calling', 'succeeding', 'So', 'Coach', 'dilemma', 'when', 'playoffs', 'start', 'go', 'Young', 'Hot', 'Shot', 'who', 'cameras', 'Owner', 'love', 'tried', 'true', 'methods', 'Old', 'Star', 'Well', 'Young', 'Hot', 'Shot', 'isolated', 'rest', 'team', 'brash', 'comments', 'rise', 'household', 'name', 'three', 'games', 'So', 'Coach', 'unconfident', 'Old', 'Star', 'first', 'game', 'playoffs', 'while', 'Young', 'Hot', 'Shot', 'been', 'learning', 'lesson', 'quietly', 'nodding', 'understanding', 'Coach', 'rousing', 'halftime', 'speeches', 'So', 'when', 'time', 'Old', 'Star', 'again', 'injured', 'Young', 'Hot', 'Shot', 'ready', 'step', 'time', 'though', 'Coach', 'accepted', 'Young', 'Hot', 'Shot', 'unruly', 'methods', 'just', 'go', 'course', 'win', 'game.Sound', 'familiar', 'should', 'plot', 'sports', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'actual', 'names', 'describe', 'expected', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Stone', 'attempt', 'show', 'what', 'pro', 'sports', 'really', 'apparently', 'thought', 'story', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter', 'focus', 'almost', 'everything', 'football', 'egos', 'characters', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'owner', 'inaccurate', 'news', 'reporting', 'not', 'football', 'games', 'are', 'reduced', 'darkened', 'rainy', 'war', 'scenes', 'people', 'loosing', 'eyes', 'literally', 'front', 'flips', 'defenders', 'someone', 'getting', 'injured', 'almost', 'play.Whether', 'not', 'football', 'actually', 'way', 'Stone', 'did', 'not', 'paint', 'convincing', 'picture', 'whatsoever', 'Essentially', 'owner', '*nothing*', 'players', 'coaches', 'clear', 'players', 'play', 'when', 'are', 'one', 'hit', 'away', 'having', 'aneurism', 'players', 'intentionally', 'do', ""n't"", 'block', 'front', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'quarterback', 'Sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Stone', 'league', 'dark', 'depressing', 'unforgiving', 'torture', 'chamber', 'games', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'fourth-grade', 'scramble', 'park', 'Football', 'most', 'complex', 'game', 'planet', 'why', 'not', 'show', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'Instead', 'Carolina', 'Panthers', 'New', 'England', 'Patriots', 'who', 'chose', 'have', 'introduced', 'team', 'rather', 'individuals', 'get', 'tough', 'swallow', 'Miami', 'Sharks', 'who', '*hate*', 'other', 'team', 'would', 'never', 'make', 'playoffs', 'never', 'then', 'make', 'even', 'worse', 'thrown', 'together', 'horrendous', 'MTV-style', 'montage', 'movie', 'edited', 'commercial', 'just', 'feels', 'collection', 'scenes', 'not', 'movie.I', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'especially', 'love', 'football', 'are', 'hoping', 'good', 'sports', 'movie', 'war', 'film', 'costume', 'sports', 'film', 'apparently', 'Stone', ""n't"", 'think', 'audience', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'understand', 'scene', 'scene', 'gladiators', 'fighting', 'coliseum', 'ramming', 'analogy', 'down', 'viewer', 'throat', 'should', 'stick', 'war/crime', 'movies', 'stop', 'trying', 'impose', 'genre', 'innocent', 'films']",N/A
120285,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,0790749912,Robert I. Hedges,"[15, 24]","I am actually the last person that most people would expect to endorse this film. I don't really like football, and I generally don't care for Oliver Stone. Now that I have made that disclaimer, I have to say that this is an extremely good movie. The writing, camera work and acting are all first rate. The sound editing is particularly first rate, enhancing the on screen action immeasurably. The DVD edition is crisp and has many special features.Essentially this film is a story of a failing football team with an aging coach (Pacino) and an arrogant young quarterback (Foxx, who really has a terrific throwing arm) who struggle to work together, at first failing miserably. Ultimately, they complete the evolution to a true team and find victory in teamwork. The plot is intricate, yet never boring as Pacino struggles for personal redemption and a new start while reigning in Foxx, and Foxx struggles with all authority, most particularly the coaching staff.An excellent supporting cast rounds out the production, notably Dennis Quaid as an aging quarterback, a one time nemesis of Foxx, and James Woods as a slimy team doctor in a role that only he could execute this flawlessly.I would have given this film five stars except for some unsightly (full frontal male) nudity, bad language that fails to enhance the plot and a disgusting, dislodged eyeball scene that did nothing to help the movie other than crank up the gore. With the exception of those quibbles, the movie is a very well made, very human movie that most mature audiences (even us non sports lovers) will like.",4,Pacino and Foxx are Outstanding,1063324800,"09 12, 2003",2003,1581,"['am', 'actually', 'last', 'person', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'expect', 'endorse', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'football', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Now', 'have', 'made', 'disclaimer', 'have', 'say', 'extremely', 'good', 'movie', 'writing', 'camera', 'work', 'acting', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'sound', 'editing', 'particularly', 'first', 'rate', 'enhancing', 'screen', 'action', 'immeasurably', 'DVD', 'edition', 'crisp', 'many', 'special', 'features.Essentially', 'film', 'story', 'failing', 'football', 'team', 'aging', 'coach', 'Pacino', 'arrogant', 'young', 'quarterback', 'Foxx', 'who', 'really', 'terrific', 'throwing', 'arm', 'who', 'struggle', 'work', 'together', 'first', 'failing', 'miserably', 'Ultimately', 'complete', 'evolution', 'true', 'team', 'find', 'victory', 'teamwork', 'plot', 'intricate', 'yet', 'never', 'boring', 'Pacino', 'personal', 'redemption', 'new', 'start', 'reigning', 'Foxx', 'Foxx', 'struggles', 'authority', 'most', 'particularly', 'coaching', 'staff.An', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'out', 'production', 'notably', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'aging', 'quarterback', 'one', 'time', 'nemesis', 'Foxx', 'James', 'Woods', 'slimy', 'team', 'doctor', 'role', 'only', 'could', 'execute', 'flawlessly.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'unsightly', 'full', 'frontal', 'male', 'nudity', 'bad', 'language', 'enhance', 'plot', 'disgusting', 'dislodged', 'eyeball', 'scene', 'did', 'nothing', 'help', 'movie', 'other', 'crank', 'gore', 'exception', 'quibbles', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'very', 'human', 'movie', 'most', 'mature', 'audiences', 'even', 'non', 'sports', 'lovers', 'will', 'like']",N/A
120286,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0790749912,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 9]","Unlike ""Jerry Maguire,"" which found a way to appeal to a broad segment of  the movie going public, Oliver Stone's ""Any Given Sunday"" pretty much  requires that one be a hardcore aficionado of professional football to  really appreciate it.  Stone and co-writer John Logan deserve credit for  attempting to create a comprehensive panoramic view of the sport, warts and  all.  For example, they don't shy away from portraying the drug abuse and  shady medical practices that run rampant both in the locker room and out.  Nor do they minimize the detrimental effect that has come about as  professional football has become more and more about obscenely huge  salaries, product endorsements and individual stardom and less and less  about the values of winning and sticking together as a  team.Unfortunately, the canvas becomes simply too broad to keep all this  profundity in focus.  For every sharp psychological insight into the people  and values that comprise this sport/industry, the film provides half a  dozen hoary clich&eacute;s, stock characters and predictable plot turns that  consistently undercut those quality elements.  Al Pacino plays the typical  aging coach who, as his losing team begins to become the laughingstock of  the league, must decide whether to bow to corporate pressure and remove the  injured, aging quarterback (Dennis Quaid) or stay true to his ideals and  demonstrate loyalty to his players.  Cameron Diaz plays Pacino's major foil  as the hard-driven team owner whose only motivating factor seems to be the  Almighty Buck.  By making this character a beautiful woman, the authors get  to play it both ways:  they satisfy the feminists by showing that a woman  can be just as ruthless and cutthroat as any man in a position of  decision-making power, yet, by making her so evil, they also placate all  those men who have been smugly assuring us for years that ""professional  football is no place for a woman.""  (The filmmakers even have her cry in a  few places).  Around these two main antagonists swirl a dozen or so equally  stereotypical characters including the nefarious team doctor (James Wood,  in yet another of his one-dimensional villain roles), whose shameless  disregard for the health of the players is set in obvious counterpoint to  the righteous young intern (Matthew Modine) who is frankly shocked at this  senior doctor's cavalier indifference to the Hippocratic Oath.  LL Cool J  has a minimal and undeveloped role as a cocaine-sniffing rival to the  upstart young quarterback (Jamie Foxx) whose lack of understanding about  the role team spirit plays in a winning strategy provides much of the  driving force of the plot.  Not only does Foxx give by far and away the  finest, most intensely dramatic performance of the film, but also his  character provides the few moments of really solid insightful drama in the  entire movie.  However, so intent are Logan and Stone in providing an  upbeat ending to the film that they completely abandon the truths of this  character and send him through a 180-degree conversion that is never  adequately dramatized in the screenplay.  He simply awakens one morning a  new man, all ready to take his rightful place as a rah-rah team player.  In  fact, the neat way in which all the characters and loose plot ends somehow  resolve themselves into the happiest possible outcome contradicts the tone  of thoughtful seriousness the filmmakers have been trying to establish all  throughout the film.This soft final section of the film is not the only  element that undercuts the verisimilitude of the story.  For some reason,  in a day and age in which Brand X has long since passed from the scene in  the world of advertising and the most minor of sports films routinely use  real life teams as focuses for their stories, Stone has opted to create not  only a fictional franchise but a fictional league as well.  Moreover,  because the team allegedly hails from Florida, the entire season seems to  be played under the glowing auspices of blazing sunshine and balmy tropical  breezes.  For a sport one associates with crisp fall weather and  bone-chilling blizzards, this entire summer-like atmosphere seems a bit  disconcerting.As a director, Stone buries the drama under a flurry of  MTV-like stylistic flourishes.  Too cute by half, this pretentious  directorial method merely serves as a device to distance us from the  characters whose plights should be drawing us deeper into the film.  In the  middle of quietly dramatic scenes, Stone intercuts, in rapid succession,  utterly irrelevant shots of lightning storms, roiling clouds and even  snippets from the ""Ben-Hur"" chariot race (as a possible sop to Charlton  Heston who makes a cameo appearance herein?).  Similarly, the never-ending  cacophony of blaring rap tunes cluttering up the soundtrack cannot cover up  the essential emptiness of the film's characters and message.  Stone has  rarely seemed so transparent in his facile slickness.  Even the football  scenes are pumped-up beyond necessity.  Part of the beauty of the sport  lies in seeing the players' movements as all of a piece.  In the visually  fractured view that Stone accords us, he does not heighten our excitement  and involvement, but rather diminishes them.""Any Given Sunday"" is  definitely a long haul and it does offer a few moments of effective drama  scattered along the way.  But if you are going to devote 157 minutes to the  subject of professional football, you might find that time better spent  watching the real thing.",2,pumped-up but shallow film,968457600,"09 9,

For the most part, those comparisons will  be invalid.  The question of which of the two movies is the greatest  football team of all time would be like comparing the Green Bay Packers  teams of the 1960's to the San Francisco 49'ers teams of the 80's.  Both  pictures are great, but they provide the viewer with a snapshot of  pro-football in different eras.&quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, at almost  three hours running time, is easily Oliver Stone's best picture since  &quot;Born on the 4th of July&quot;.  It stars Al Pacino as a beleagered  football coach of a losing franchise and Cameron Diaz as the MBA owner who  has inherited the team from her late father.  They both turn in fine  performances, but it is the performance of comedian Jamie Foxx as an  egotistical young quarterback that makes this all work.  Dennis Quaid is  quite effective as an aging quarterback whose injury paves the way for  Foxx's character to show his stuff.  Jim Brown is excellent as of the  team's assistant coaches and Pacino's old friend.  In addition, there are a  number of fine performances from L. L. Cool J., Lawrence Taylor, James  Woods, Matthew Modine, Clifton Davis, Ann-Margaret, and even Oliver Stone  himself.  Look for former Oklahoma and Dallas Cowboy coach Barry Switzer in  a cameo role as well as one of my favorite character actors, John C.  McGinley, as a full-of-himself football analyst.  Charlton (NRA) Heston  also briefly appears as the league commissioner.The action in this movie  is good, and juxtaposed against the rap music background really makes it  seem almost frenetic at times, even the slo-mo shots.

120291,ABE14SVILZLNY,0790749912,"SID ""Punk""","[1, 1]","Sports movies are tough to make. Creating the essence of the actual event is the toughest. Most films fall short in the editing process of the event or through sheer carelessness and lack of knowledge. ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is somewhat of an exception. It is hard-hitting and bloody like NORTH DALLAS FORTY. It is actually conventional when you think about it, like a warped RUDY. It is a hell of a lot more realistic than say, NECESSARY ROUGHNESS. These are all football films with varying degrees of success (except ROUGHNESS), but Oliver Stone, in his usual over the top way, throws a dizzying, mind-splitting film at us, much like the sport itself. This is why I liked it.Oliver Stone began a wicked spell of filmmaking with JFK, evident in its editing style. Fast-paced, black and white mixed with color, documentary-like methods ensued in NATURAL BORN KILLERS, NIXON, and the ghastly U-TURN. Nothing is new here with ANY GIVEN SUNDAY. Football is a battlefield Stone chooses to depict and depict it he does. Even the most ardent fans of the sport do not really know what it is like for a quarterback to drop back and get rid of a piece of pigskin before 11 players maul him. You certainly get the idea watching this.Al Pacino is the dried up head coach of the fictional Miami Sharks and he barks out the usual coaching cliches you hear in press conferences after real games. Pacino also seems to be sleep-walking through the picture. At times, he appears drunk even when he is not supposed to be. Cameron Diaz's character, a young chick owner, (yeah right) destroys any credibility the film may have had going in (Even the NFL would have nothing to do with this movie). Her constant bickering is so over-done, you almost feel like hurling much the way Jamie Foxx does every time he enters a game as the team's 3rd string quarterback. Realisticly speaking, this is not a very sane film about football. It is a maniacal celebration of the game. The scenes on the field are the ones I cherished. Beware of the locker room or domestic sequences.No one has ever put such energy into football scenes in a film before. He definitely had some good consultants. There are some comical cameos - Johnny Unitas and Dick Butkus play opposing coaches. Lawrence Taylor can actually act a teeny bit and Jim Brown shares the film's best off the field scene with Pacino in a bar. Stone tries to show us how the game has changed. He resonates past glory with quotes from Lombardi, dissolves showing Red ""the Galloping Ghost"" Grange, and even Unitas handing off to Ameche. TV has changed everything, says the coach, and he is right. It seems to be all about the money nowadays.That is the message, but you'll find yourself losing that idea in the lunacy of ANY GIVEN SUNDAY and the bone-crushing, ear-damaging football scenes. They are filmed and cut with such raw intensity, you feel like playing afterwards. This is definitely a film for football fans only unless you like big, sweaty men. Is there a big game at the end that needs to be won? Yes, and this surprised me considering how unconventional Stone usually is. Basically, surrender your senses and thought process to Stone's most entertaining film in quite some time.",3,Any Given Sunday,1032912000,"09 25, 2002",2002,3208,"['Sports', 'movies', 'are', 'tough', 'make', 'Creating', 'essence', 'actual', 'event', 'toughest', 'Most', 'films', 'fall', 'short', 'editing', 'process', 'event', 'sheer', 'carelessness', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'ANY', 'GIVEN', 'SUNDAY', 'somewhat', 'exception', 'hard-hitting', 'bloody', 'NORTH', 'DALLAS', 'FORTY', 'actually', 'conventional', 'when', 'think', 'warped', 'RUDY', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'realistic', 'say', 'NECESSARY', 'ROUGHNESS', 'are', 'football', 'films', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'ROUGHNESS', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'usual', 'top', 'way', 'dizzying', 'mind-splitting', 'film', 'much', 'sport', 'why', 'liked', 'it.Oliver', 'Stone', 'began', 'wicked', 'spell', 'filmmaking', 'JFK', 'evident', 'editing', 'style', 'Fast-paced', 'black', 'white', 'mixed', 'color', 'documentary-like', 'methods', 'ensued', 'NATURAL', 'BORN', 'KILLERS', 'NIXON', 'ghastly', 'U-TURN', 'Nothing', 'new', 'here', 'ANY', 'GIVEN', 'SUNDAY', 'Football', 'battlefield', 'Stone', 'depict', 'depict', 'Even', 'most', 'ardent', 'fans', 'sport', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'quarterback', 'drop', 'back', 'get', 'rid', 'piece', 'pigskin', '11', 'players', 'maul', 'certainly', 'get', 'idea', 'watching', 'this.Al', 'Pacino', 'dried', 'up', 'head', 'coach', 'fictional', 'Miami', 'Sharks', 'out', 'usual', 'coaching', 'cliches', 'hear', 'press', 'conferences', 'real', 'games', 'Pacino', 'also', 'be', 'sleep-walking', 'picture', 'times', 'drunk', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'character', 'young', 'chick', 'owner', 'yeah', 'right', 'credibility', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'going', 'Even', 'NFL', 'would', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'constant', 'bickering', 'so', 'over-done', 'almost', 'feel', 'hurling', 'much', 'way', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'time', 'game', 'team', '3rd', 'string', 'quarterback', 'Realisticly', 'speaking', 'not', 'very', 'sane', 'film', 'football', 'maniacal', 'celebration', 'game', 'scenes', 'field', 'are', 'ones', 'cherished', 'Beware', 'locker', 'room', 'domestic', 'sequences.No', 'one', 'ever', 'put', 'such', 'energy', 'football', 'scenes', 'film', 'before', 'definitely', 'had', 'good', 'consultants', 'are', 'comical', 'cameos', 'Johnny', 'Unitas', 'Dick', 'Butkus', 'play', 'opposing', 'coaches', 'Lawrence', 'Taylor', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'teeny', 'bit', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'shares', 'film', 'best', 'field', 'scene', 'Pacino', 'bar', 'Stone', 'show', 'how', 'game', 'changed', 'past', 'glory', 'quotes', 'Lombardi', 'showing', 'Red', 'Galloping', 'Ghost', 'Grange', 'even', 'Unitas', 'handing', 'off', 'Ameche', 'TV', 'changed', 'everything', 'coach', 'right', 'be', 'money', 'message', ""'ll"", 'find', 'losing', 'idea', 'lunacy', 'ANY', 'GIVEN', 'SUNDAY', 'bone-crushing', 'ear-damaging', 'football', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'cut', 'such', 'raw', 'intensity', 'feel', 'playing', 'afterwards', 'definitely', 'film', 'football', 'fans', 'only', 'like', 'big', 'sweaty', 'men', 'there', 'big', 'game', 'end', 'be', 'won', 'Yes', 'surprised', 'considering', 'how', 'unconventional', 'Stone', 'usually', 'Basically', 'surrender', 'senses', 'thought', 'process', 'Stone', 'most', 'entertaining', 'film', 'quite', 'time']",N/A
120292,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,0790749912,Stanley Crowe,"[1, 1]","This movie becomes more predictable and formulaic as it goes on, but the direction is so hyperactive that you might not notice that until you think about it in retrospect . . . although I'm not sure that it's the kind of movie that invites reflection.  Basically, it's about a cocky young quarterback (Jamie Foxx) having to learn that (as the cliche goes) there's no ""i"" in ""team.""  I'm going to assume, though, that that familiar plot is used only as a pretext on which Oliver Stone can hang a critique of the culture of football.  No one comes off well here.  Miami Head Coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino) and his defensive co-ordinator Montezuma Monroe (Jim Brown) talk of the lost ""purity"" of football, but their actions belie their words.  They're manipulative and driven -- and although Tony talks about being out-of-touch with the modern game, he resigns his job only to take another with an expansion team.  The team owner, played by Cameron Diaz, seems to be concerned about the team's performance mainly because it is likely to affect the price she can get for it if she can find a West Coast buyer -- and her efforts to do that put her in hot water with the commissioner (a nice cameo by Charlton Heston, seen earlier in the movie on Tony's TV in the ""Ben-Hur"" chariot scene).  Heston looks a little fragile -- it's touching to see a fading star in a movie in which the fading of stars (and their fading earning power) is something the movie dwells on.  The veteran quarterback Cap Rooney (Dennis Quaid) and an aging linebacker Shark Lavay (Lawrence Taylor) both play with the risk of life-changing injuries, one under bullying from this wife and the other because he needs a sack or two more to earn a bonus specified in his contract.  There's a powerful scene in which Lavay schools the cocky young quarterback, and it all sounds quite high-minded -- except that Lavay himself is hanging on more for money than for anything else.  Off the field, it's all drinking, drugging, prostitutes (high-end), and a general lack of impulse control.  There's a funny scene in which Tony starts to talk to the high end girl who's servicing him about starting an ongoing relationship with him.  She assumes that he means a ""business"" relationship -- when it appears that he doesn't, it's (as they say) awkward, though arguably the girl comes out of it with more dignity than Tony.The Jerry Maguire mantra ""Show me the money"" is very much part of this movie too, then.  What messes one's responses up a bit, however, is the frantic camerawork in the on-field scenes.  I think this is a serious flaw, because it doesn't seem to represent anything real.  Professional players don't perceive the game this way -- in reality the game is violent and stressful, but it isn't chaotic: these guys know their jobs.  And fans don't perceive the game this way -- they're at a distance, in the seats, where they can see the developing patterns of the plays.  So what point of view does the camera represent?  I think it's Stone's view of how an ordinary fan might experience the battle ""in the trenches,"" and that's a fake viewpoint that generates excitement and interest dishonestly or cheaply.  It also involves the watcher pseudo-vicariously in something that other parts of the movie offer up as requiring criticism, even condemnation  -- James Woods as the team doctor, along with Diaz as the owner being the ones for whom condemnation seems appropriate, but the rot is really everywhere, as I suggested above.The acting is all that the plot and themes require. I'm not convinced that it required all that, say, Pacino or Foxx is capable of.  Diaz and Woods are given one-dimensional characters.  It was nice to see Ann-Margaret, aging very gracefully, as Diaz's alcoholic mother, but her part is one-dimensional too (""This game took my husband . . .""!!!)  Aaron Eckhart as Tony's replacement-in-waiting and Matthew Modine as a young doctor struggling not to become like James Woods are fine in small roles, as is LL CoolJ as a running back with an eye on making his bonus.  Most involving performance?  I would say Dennis Quaid as the aging and infirm QB -- he conveys his pride, his fear, his loyalty, and his courage, and the scene where his wife upbraids him when he talks about retirement is the most humanly involving in the movie.  Good work, Dennis.",3,"3.5 stars . . . frantic, messy, but at least not dull",1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,4344,"['movie', 'more', 'predictable', 'formulaic', 'direction', 'so', 'hyperactive', 'might', 'not', 'notice', 'think', 'retrospect', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'kind', 'movie', 'reflection', 'Basically', 'cocky', 'young', 'quarterback', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'having', 'learn', 'cliche', 'i', 'team', ""'m"", 'going', 'assume', 'though', 'familiar', 'plot', 'used', 'only', 'pretext', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'can', 'hang', 'critique', 'culture', 'football', 'one', 'off', 'well', 'here', 'Miami', 'Head', 'Coach', 'Tony', ""D'Amato"", 'Al', 'Pacino', 'defensive', 'co-ordinator', 'Montezuma', 'Monroe', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'talk', 'lost', 'purity', 'football', 'actions', 'belie', 'words', ""'re"", 'manipulative', 'driven', 'Tony', 'talks', 'being', 'out-of-touch', 'modern', 'game', 'job', 'only', 'take', 'expansion', 'team', 'team', 'owner', 'played', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'be', 'concerned', 'team', 'performance', 'mainly', 'likely', 'affect', 'price', 'can', 'get', 'can', 'find', 'West', 'Coast', 'buyer', 'efforts', 'do', 'put', 'hot', 'water', 'commissioner', 'nice', 'cameo', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'seen', 'earlier', 'movie', 'Tony', 'TV', 'Ben-Hur', 'chariot', 'scene', 'Heston', 'little', 'fragile', 'touching', 'see', 'fading', 'star', 'movie', 'fading', 'stars', 'fading', 'earning', 'power', 'something', 'movie', 'veteran', 'quarterback', 'Cap', 'Rooney', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'aging', 'linebacker', 'Shark', 'Lavay', 'Lawrence', 'Taylor', 'play', 'risk', 'life-changing', 'injuries', 'one', 'bullying', 'wife', 'other', 'sack', 'two', 'more', 'earn', 'bonus', 'specified', 'contract', 'powerful', 'scene', 'Lavay', 'schools', 'cocky', 'young', 'quarterback', 'quite', 'high-minded', 'Lavay', 'hanging', 'more', 'money', 'anything', 'else', 'field', 'drinking', 'drugging', 'prostitutes', 'high-end', 'general', 'lack', 'impulse', 'control', 'funny', 'scene', 'Tony', 'talk', 'high', 'end', 'girl', 'who', 'servicing', 'starting', 'ongoing', 'relationship', 'business', 'relationship', 'when', ""n't"", 'say', 'awkward', 'arguably', 'girl', 'more', 'dignity', 'Tony.The', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'Show', 'money', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'movie', 'too', 'then', 'What', 'one', 'up', 'bit', 'however', 'frantic', 'camerawork', 'on-field', 'scenes', 'think', 'serious', 'flaw', ""n't"", 'seem', 'represent', 'anything', 'real', 'Professional', 'players', 'do', ""n't"", 'perceive', 'game', 'way', 'reality', 'game', 'violent', 'stressful', ""n't"", 'chaotic', 'guys', 'know', 'jobs', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'perceive', 'game', 'way', ""'re"", 'distance', 'seats', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'developing', 'patterns', 'plays', 'So', 'what', 'point', 'view', 'camera', 'represent', 'think', 'Stone', 'view', 'how', 'ordinary', 'fan', 'might', 'experience', 'battle', 'trenches', 'fake', 'viewpoint', 'excitement', 'interest', 'dishonestly', 'cheaply', 'also', 'watcher', 'pseudo-vicariously', 'something', 'other', 'parts', 'movie', 'offer', 'up', 'requiring', 'criticism', 'even', 'condemnation', 'James', 'Woods', 'team', 'doctor', 'Diaz', 'owner', 'being', 'ones', 'whom', 'condemnation', 'appropriate', 'rot', 'really', 'everywhere', 'suggested', 'above.The', 'acting', 'plot', 'themes', 'require', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'required', 'say', 'Pacino', 'Foxx', 'capable', 'Diaz', 'Woods', 'are', 'given', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Ann-Margaret', 'aging', 'very', 'gracefully', 'Diaz', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'part', 'one-dimensional', 'too', 'game', 'took', 'husband', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Tony', 'replacement-in-waiting', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'young', 'doctor', 'struggling', 'not', 'become', 'James', 'Woods', 'are', 'fine', 'small', 'roles', 'LL', 'CoolJ', 'running', 'back', 'eye', 'making', 'bonus', 'Most', 'involving', 'performance', 'would', 'say', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'aging', 'infirm', 'QB', 'conveys', 'pride', 'fear', 'loyalty', 'courage', 'scene', 'where', 'wife', 'upbraids', 'when', 'retirement', 'most', 'humanly', 'involving', 'movie', 'Good', 'work', 'Dennis']",N/A

Just got the BluRay version and must say that I am greatly disappointed in the transfer.  I won't get into the ad nausium summaries of the plot that so many here insist on writing about, just the quality of the disc.  Here is a movie filled with crowd scenes, party scenes and, of course, multiple football scenes full of crashes, body blows and a conundrum of other audio ambiences and yet the quality of the audio mixing is downright lousy.  The surround channels are rarely used and for a movie of this nature, that is downright criminal.  A movie like this should have perfect audio mixing to the point of being a demo disc yet, other than the center and front left and rights(and not very much of those even) there really is no surround mixing.  In addition, the dialogue channels is very poorly leveled with the other channels.  This made it difficult to hear the dialogue at times as it was fighting the soundtrack which was mixed too high and hot.  The video transfer was a B at best.  Colors were nicely presented with no bleeding or stair stepping but there was considerable video noise in some scenes while almost none in others.  The sauna scene towards the end of the film had a great deal of video noise which you might not see due to the steam but it was most definitely there.On a positive note, the blu ray dvd has a literal ton of extras included deleted scenes, extended scenes, even audition scenes.  The weird thing is that once a extra was finished, the DVD did not go back to the Extras menu but went straight to the movie again making you have to go back to the menu and navigate to the extras and pick another. The worst interactive menu I have ever come across.This is a fine movie, have always liked it and still do, but the Blu Ray provides little, if any, improvement over the original release.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",3,ON ANY GIVEN SUNDAY BLURAY Dissappointment,1332460800,"03 23, 2012",2012,2248,"['enjoy', 'movie', 'have', 'had', 'standard', 'DVD', 'collection', 'long', 'time', 'Just', 'got', 'BluRay', 'version', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'transfer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'ad', 'nausium', 'summaries', 'plot', 'so', 'many', 'here', 'insist', 'writing', 'just', 'quality', 'disc', 'Here', 'movie', 'filled', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'party', 'scenes', 'course', 'multiple', 'football', 'scenes', 'full', 'crashes', 'body', 'blows', 'conundrum', 'other', 'audio', 'ambiences', 'yet', 'quality', 'audio', 'mixing', 'downright', 'lousy', 'surround', 'channels', 'are', 'rarely', 'used', 'movie', 'nature', 'downright', 'criminal', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'perfect', 'audio', 'mixing', 'point', 'being', 'demo', 'disc', 'yet', 'other', 'center', 'front', 'left', 'rights', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'even', 'really', 'surround', 'mixing', 'addition', 'dialogue', 'channels', 'very', 'poorly', 'leveled', 'other', 'channels', 'made', 'difficult', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'times', 'was', 'fighting', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'mixed', 'too', 'high', 'hot', 'video', 'transfer', 'was', 'B', 'best', 'Colors', 'were', 'nicely', 'presented', 'bleeding', 'stair', 'stepping', 'was', 'considerable', 'video', 'noise', 'scenes', 'almost', 'none', 'others', 'sauna', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'video', 'noise', 'might', 'not', 'see', 'due', 'steam', 'was', 'most', 'definitely', 'there.On', 'positive', 'note', 'blu', 'ray', 'dvd', 'literal', 'ton', 'extras', 'included', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'extended', 'scenes', 'even', 'audition', 'scenes', 'weird', 'thing', 'once', 'extra', 'was', 'finished', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'Extras', 'menu', 'went', 'straight', 'movie', 'again', 'making', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'menu', 'navigate', 'extras', 'pick', 'worst', 'interactive', 'menu', 'have', 'ever', 'come', 'across.This', 'fine', 'movie', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'still', 'do', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'little', 'improvement', 'original', 'release.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A

As you'll read here this film draws mixed emotions from many here who have seen it. Being an Oliver Stone production I guess other felt this film should have had more depth due to him being the Director however my opinion was that maybe Stone for once didn't want to push the whole ""message"" thing he normally does and instead focused more on entertainment with the flamboyant actors who did fit with what I believe this film tried to project.On the negative side however I wish they did add to the backstory of Cameron Diaz' character as I feel her role left questions unanswered and more about her character was needed to make sense of her actions. If you pay attention to the subtle background conversations and chatter you'll discover Cameron's character was making some bad calls like losing 3 draft picks for unknown reasons and her secret deal to move the franchise as well as the financial issues of needing a new stadium. Had these things been more thoroughly explained, Cameron Diaz would not have been outshined by LL and LT as an actor as she was in this film. LT for example had a simpler role in this film but outshined Cameron Diaz solely because his character fit him better.Overall this was a very entertaining film and could be enjoyed provided you accept these weaknesses in the plot and instead enjoy the film for what I believe it's intention was; to be a fast paced action movie with subtle life lessons mixed in.

120307,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,0790749912,Wheelchair Assassin,"[14, 18]","Are you suffering from the annual bout of post-Super Bowl depression (PSBD)?  Is this Sunday, the first since the end of the NFL season, leaving you feeling lost, already looking ahead to September so you can resume watching a collection of pumped-up, tattoed freaks of nature perform astounding feats of physical prowess?  Are you terrified at the thought of having to spend Sundays reading, going outside, or spending quality time with loved ones?  Well, if you are, you could do a lot worse than to postpone the onset of PSBD by reclining in your favorite easy chair and watching Any Given Sunday.Any Given Sunday has a lot to recommend it.  It's got a sweet Hollywood budget, a cast loaded to the brim with talent (and no sign of Keanu Reeves, thankfully; I'm still having nightmares from the time I watched the Replacements), and the direction of the one and only Oliver Stone.  In following the turbulent last quarter of a season in the life of the (fictional) Miami Sharks of the (fictional) AFFA, the movie combines an operatic scope with an almost fanatical attention to detail and loads of heavy philosophy for a film whose best moments (whether on the field or not) are as hard-hitting as anything you'll see in a real game.  Sure, the movie trots out an endless series of hackneyed plot devices and stock characters, but Stone manages to breathe life into all of them.A no-holds-barred if sensationalistic examination of professional football both on and off the field, Any Given Sunday is both believable and completely ridiculous at the same time, a monument to excess that is in itself wildly excessive.  It starts punishing your senses right away, with two quarterbacks suffering catastrophic injuries and a third throwing up before taking his first snap, and it doesn't relax much from there on out, either in its torrid pace or in its commitment to full sensory assault.  Indeed, this may be the fastest two-and-a-half-hour movie ever made.  Like an all-out blitz up the middle, it comes at you relentlessly, and also like an all-out blitz, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  At times it seems as though Stone just tried to take the themes and conflicts that made Platoon such an artistic triumph and graft them onto a football movie.  The movie goes for an outsized, epic feel at almost all times, with varying degrees of success.At turns frenetic and painfully slow, Stone's camerawork makes for perhaps the best cinematic representation yet of the intensity and ferocity of pro football, and the movie's grasp of the game's strategical minutiae is a sign of a director who's done his homework.  Regrettably, Stone's emphasis on brutal hits and flashy shots also takes something away from the inherent sophistication of the pro game, making it look like little more than the product of excessive testosterone levels.  Of course, what happens on the field is only part of the story, as Stone makes sure to present the viewer with look at all the sordid goings-on that occur behind the scenes.  It's here that the movie really throws everything but the kitchen sink at you, politely ensuring that boredom doesn't set in between game scenes.  You've got fights; rampant substance abuse; players fornicating left and right; a mammoth SUV getting sawed in half; scads of gratuitous nudity; guys playing when they shouldn't even be trying to walk and chew gum and the same time; and lots of hot women acting extremely catty.

120309,AY8WZDYR79GFV,0790749912,Yasha Banana,"[2, 7]","It's hard to know where to start with this movie.  Should one begin by saying, ""Poor Al Pacino""?  Or ""Poor Oliver Stone""? ... Two talents, notably wasted.Let's start with Al, a paisan. ...Where have you gone, Al Pacino?  A nation turns its lonely eyes to your lonely eyes.  Was it in ""And Justice For All"" that you started *lecturing* us?  There you are, holding forth on this, that or the other.  But this isn't acting, Al baby, it's pontificating.That might not be so bad if ""Any Given Sunday"" has something to say.  It doesn't.  It's an empty, cynical, mean-spirited film.Stone, as director, co-writer and bit actor in the movie, wants it both ways.  On one hand, he hauls out every clich&eacute;, every truism, every shallow intellectually-impoverished ""insight"" about football -- that it uses up bodies and spirits -- that it represent corporatism-gone-wild-- that it's no longer anything near a ""game"" but instead a ruthless, soulless business.  All of which Stone, as director/writer pontificates about via his actors.At the same time, he wants it the *other* way, too.  That is to say, he takes every opportunity to show us the blood-lust of professional football -- the spectacular hits, the macho strutting, the caveman sexuality.  In short, all the worst aspects of human nature.Come on, Ollie, make-up-yer-mind!  You can't have it both ways, boychick.It's not that there aren't talented people involved in this movie.  Like so many other pieces of Hollywood crap, there is a great deal of talent in front of and behind the camera.  But to what end?  To say what?Here's Oliver Stone making ""JFK"" in which he postulates that JFK was bumped off by, among others, the military-industrial complex.  Ok, fine, that being the case, then why doesn't he offer us in ""On Any Given Sunday,"" any meaningful, insightful, first-order connection between football and the brutality of American militarism; football and the corporatization of America; football and ""The American way of life.""  Any attempts to do this in the movie are embarrassingly weak and sophomoric.Consider Oliver Stone's ""take"" on 9-11; the ridiculous movie he made about the heroes of 9-11.  Say, Oliver, think there might be just a *tad* of evidence that 9-1l was perhaps ""allowed to happen"" -- or worse?  That there is, in fact, a truckload of information, evidence and ""background context"" that's been systematically ignored by the Establishment, and that maybe a talented filmmaker such as yourself can shed some light on. ... But wait a second, there I go mistaking you for someone other than a status quo-defending Establishment mainstay.Getting back to ""On Any Given Sunmday,"" the funniest part of the movie, albeit completley unintentional, is the quick-cut, still-photo reference to Al Pacino's character as a quarterback star in days-gone-by.  Oh, please, Lord have mercy!  (And, please note: I'm an agnostic.)  Al Pacino as a quarterback?!I'm old enough to remember when some quarterbacks were short, e.g., Eddie LaBaron and Bobby Layne in the 1950s, but please: Al Pacino as a quarterback?  He'd have to bring a ladder to the line of scrimmage every time he threw a pass.As previously noted, the movie is packed with talented craftsman, Stone and Pacino included among them.  But what are they toiling at?  Answer: A pretentious piece of violent, frenzied, cynical, intellectually-addled nonsense.  (And those are the *good* parts of the movie!  Ba-da-bing-bing!)Cameron Diaz is talented enough to be in quality movies.  An occurence that's yet to happen.Even if all the movie aspires to be is ""entertaining,"" it's a flop.  It's totally ridiculous on the face of it.  The only entertainment value it can have is for the audience to laugh out loud at its shallowness and pomposity.Enough, Oliver, with these nanosecond, wink-of-an-eye, hyperactive montage cuts.  You're a grown man, now, Oliver; rapid eye movement syndrome is not for you.  (Or us.)Question: You went so fast with all the nanosecond quick-cuts, Oliver, I couldn't keep up -- was that Lee Harvey Oswald on the sidelines schtupping Caeron Diaz?  (Oh, the humanity!)Sports movies are always difficult to pull off, especially football movies.  In fact, maybe the only quality football movie ever released was ""North Dallas Forty,"" starring Nick Nolte.  Better yet, know what,"" read the book by the same name.  Although after you watch ""On Any Given Sunday"" you may want to give your eyeballs six months to calm down and return to normal.In short, next time let the camera *linger* a bit, Oliver.  Breath deeply, take a tranquilizer, study the way Vittorio DeSica used his camera.  Just calm down, Oliver, just calm down.And, Al.  Poor Al Pacino, my paisan, my cumpare.  How did it comes to this?  I want all inquiries made.  I want no acts of vengeance.  These goofy, nonsensical movies you're making, one after another after another, ALL THIS MUST END!  Kabish?And don't say: ""Can't do it, Sally,"" because we all know you can.  You're just a little confused now.

120311,AP3B615GM191G,0790749912,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 4]","Sometimes, movies are made where the sole purpose is to provide a vehicle for its stars or producers to bigger and better things.  These ""vehicle flicks"" can, from time to time, be well-made, but most of the time they are shallow and focus on all the wrong things.  That is a very apt description of ""Any Given Sunday"".For a basic plot summary, ""Sunday"" focuses on the Sharks, a pro football team coach by ""Al Pacino"".  When star quarterback ""Dennis Quaid"" goes down with an injury, third-stringer ""Jamie Foxx"" must step in and lead the team to the playoffs, all the while trying to be competitive so that owner ""Cameron Diaz"" can leverage the city for more money on a stadium deal.Unless you are hopped up on Red Bull or steroids, this movie is pretty much an incoherent mess.  It has no discernible plot, completely cardboard-cutout characters, and every single scene is punctuated by loud, driving, rock/rap music that essentially makes this experience feel like a 2.5 hour music video.Instead, this is strictly a vehicle for these purposes:-Getting Diaz in a few more sexy evening gowns-Showcasing Foxx as ""leading man"" material-Letting director Oliver Stone screw around for 150 minutes and throw theme after theme in our face while developing none of them-LL Cool J showing he can ""act"" as well as rap.The ONLY bright spot of this experience is the epic speech given by Pacino's character before the film's climax.  Surrounded by utter dreck on both sides, that speech will (if only for a few minutes) get you fired up about something.Other than that, though, ""Any Given Sunday"" is a total mess.  The inclusion of James  Woods (perhaps the single worst/most annoying actor of his time) almost seems fitting for such a stinker.  If you are a pigskin fan who wanted to enjoy this one, I suggest you do so in the middle of a roid rage or other crazy emotional moment.
