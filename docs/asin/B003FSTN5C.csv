NCIS: LA, first pitched in a cross-over episode on NCIS, features the work of an undercover team from the Office of Special Projects, located in a confiscated villa in Los Angeles.  Its mission is to deal with criminals, terrorists and spies who threaten national security.""NCIS: Los Angeles"", a younger, hipper version of the original, took a little while to find its footing.  Its early selling point was the wonderful buddy team chemistry of special agents G. Callen and Sam Hanna, played with zest by Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J.  Their verbal sparring and collaboration is a highlight of the show.The team roster took awhile to settle.  The increasing prominence given Linda Hunt as eccentric Operations Manager Hetty Lange provided balance and wry humor.  Daniela Ruah as field agent Kensi Blye quickly established her street credentials; the show was challenged to find her a suitable partner.  That partner is likely to be LA undercover cop Marty Deeks, who did a guest stint and will return for Season Two. Barrett Foa as computer geek Eric Beal and Peter Cambor as psychologist Nate Getz provided superb backup.The first season episodes pitted the team against terrorists, gun smugglers, spies and assorted bad guys, while managing to combine action, humor, and a little soul-searching.  Along the way, one agent was kidnapped and killed and others were placed at risk, while viewers were introduced to the mystery of G. Callen's origins.

However, when a commercial for an LA episode (Killshot) and it showed Abby, I decided to watch it just for an extra dose of Abby Sciuto (the goth woman). Abby was hardly in the episode (though she stole the show in what little time she had), but I didn't feel cheated. I loved the characters of LA and the story and I became hooked, rooting for Callen and his team along with Gibbs and his team. LA isn't as good as the original, but it's an awesome show with great stories and great characters. My favorite: The incomparable Hetty Lange.Which is why I had to get this set, especially since NCIS: LA looked awesome on CBS HD. Let me tell you, this Blu-Ray trounces the HDTV showings. While the HDTV sometimes had blocking on fast action, there was none of that for the Blu. It did the near impossible and looked better than the strong HDTV showing. It also sounded great, though the audio in some scenes does sometimes seem a little lower than other scenes. All in all, great for the eyes and the ears.I enjoyed the special features, despite them only being in standard definition. The info they provided about the show was really good and shows what the cast and crew are thinking, like how a set relates to a character, how they interact, and how they film for the OPS scenes. My only gripe is that they mention the original NCIS multiple times, but the closest to them showing original NCIS were clips of the original stars guest starring on LA. My favorite extras are 'Inside the Ops Center' and 'Lights...Cameras...ACTION'... Well, they will be, if and when season six of the original NCIS comes to Blu-Ray. The two parter episode of NCIS that served as the pilot for NCIS: LA (hence its inclusion, obviously). It looks and sounds as great as the actual LA episodes and makes me want NCIS to get its but on Blu-Ray now. My only complaint is that it might get people to not give the original NCIS a chance (I became a fan of NCIS' mother show JAG by renting the two discs the pilots were on and watching the non NCIS shows). Otherwise, I applaud CBS for not only including the two pilot episodes, but making them equal in quality to the other episodes. I also liked LL Cool J's music video despite not being a fan of rap. His song gave me the same impression I got when I heard Cote de Pablo sing as Ziva in a episode: Dude(ette, for Cote) can sing.All in all, a great set for fans of NCIS: Los Angeles. However, if you prefer the original to LA, this set might be worth it, if only to convince CBS to have more Blu-ray releases of both NCIS series. If you do that, great for you and bless you if anymore NCIS comes because of that. However, I stand by NCIS: LA. It's a great show I would recommend to anyone who likes action shows, cop shows, and NCIS which looks great on Blu, all 26 episodes.",5,Great set for fans of NCIS: Los Angeles,1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,2995,"['originally', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'NCIS', 'LA', 'chance', 'thinking', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'cash', 'beloved', 'NCIS', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'discovered', 'summer', '7th', 'season', 'However', 'when', 'commercial', 'LA', 'episode', 'Killshot', 'showed', 'Abby', 'decided', 'watch', 'just', 'extra', 'dose', 'Abby', 'Sciuto', 'goth', 'woman', 'Abby', 'was', 'hardly', 'episode', 'stole', 'show', 'what', 'little', 'time', 'had', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'cheated', 'loved', 'characters', 'LA', 'story', 'became', 'hooked', 'rooting', 'Callen', 'team', 'Gibbs', 'team', 'LA', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'original', 'awesome', 'show', 'great', 'stories', 'great', 'characters', 'favorite', 'incomparable', 'Hetty', 'Lange.Which', 'why', 'had', 'get', 'set', 'especially', 'NCIS', 'LA', 'looked', 'awesome', 'CBS', 'HD', 'Let', 'tell', 'Blu-Ray', 'HDTV', 'showings', 'HDTV', 'sometimes', 'had', 'blocking', 'fast', 'action', 'was', 'none', 'Blu', 'did', 'near', 'impossible', 'looked', 'better', 'strong', 'HDTV', 'showing', 'also', 'sounded', 'great', 'audio', 'scenes', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'little', 'lower', 'other', 'scenes', 'great', 'eyes', 'ears.I', 'enjoyed', 'special', 'features', 'only', 'being', 'standard', 'definition', 'info', 'provided', 'show', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'what', 'cast', 'crew', 'are', 'thinking', 'how', 'set', 'character', 'how', 'interact', 'how', 'film', 'OPS', 'scenes', 'only', 'gripe', 'mention', 'original', 'NCIS', 'multiple', 'times', 'closest', 'showing', 'original', 'NCIS', 'were', 'clips', 'original', 'stars', 'guest', 'starring', 'LA', 'favorite', 'extras', 'are', 'Ops', 'Center', ""'Lights"", 'Cameras', 'ACTION', 'Well', 'will', 'be', 'when', 'season', 'six', 'original', 'NCIS', 'Blu-Ray', 'two', 'parter', 'episode', 'NCIS', 'served', 'pilot', 'NCIS', 'LA', 'hence', 'inclusion', 'obviously', 'as', 'great', 'actual', 'LA', 'episodes', 'want', 'NCIS', 'get', 'Blu-Ray', 'now', 'only', 'complaint', 'might', 'get', 'people', 'not', 'give', 'original', 'NCIS', 'chance', 'became', 'fan', 'NCIS', 'mother', 'show', 'JAG', 'renting', 'two', 'discs', 'pilots', 'were', 'watching', 'non', 'NCIS', 'Otherwise', 'applaud', 'CBS', 'not', 'only', 'including', 'two', 'pilot', 'episodes', 'making', 'equal', 'quality', 'other', 'episodes', 'also', 'liked', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'music', 'video', 'not', 'being', 'fan', 'rap', 'song', 'gave', 'same', 'impression', 'got', 'when', 'heard', 'Cote', 'Pablo', 'sing', 'Ziva', 'episode', 'Dude', 'ette', 'Cote', 'can', 'sing.All', 'great', 'set', 'fans', 'NCIS', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'However', 'prefer', 'original', 'LA', 'set', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'convince', 'CBS', 'have', 'more', 'Blu-ray', 'releases', 'NCIS', 'series', 'do', 'great', 'bless', 'anymore', 'NCIS', 'However', 'stand', 'NCIS', 'LA', 'great', 'show', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'action', 'shows', 'cop', 'shows', 'NCIS', 'great', 'Blu', '26', 'episodes']",N/A

I had previously watched 9 seasons of NCIS (Washington team) and was tired with the plotlines, characters, and general look of the show.  By comparison, NCIS: LA was lively and humorous, with great characters and interesting storyarcs and plots.  The chemistry between actors/characters was great.  The show was fresh and original.  I really liked how the humor was present, but the seriousness of the agents' conditions and circumstances were very real.  I was impressed enough to decide to buy the following seasons, because this was a show I actually wanted to watch all the way to the end.My favorite episode of the first season was probably ""Callen, G"" (very emotional, a bit tense, and definitely mysterious).  I also loved the scene in ""Ambush"" where Callen and Sam are locked in the shed. (Callen: ""Before you [Sam] came in [to save me] I had a gun and a hostage[...] Now I'm chained to a stovepipe with a concussion..."") And I loved the Swan/Duck Oragami Scene in ""Search and Destroy"", when Sam and Callen were in the car on a stakeout, bored to the point of arguing over Callen's tootsie pop wrappers, which Sam had turned into oragami birds!  Hetty Lange was awesome, Kensi was super-cool, and everyone looked like they were having fun doing this show.This is great television, with all the necessary parts to make it one of your favorite shows.

G Callen: no first name, rootless, victim of a horrific shooting Sam witnessed, just returning to work, earlier than expected apparently. Pretty clear he has a mysterious past. Sam&G; work together seamlessly, lots of field time there, a solid bond, great fit. The image of Sam holding G and willing him not to die lingers.I was not expecting to like this NCIS knock-off. But, Sam and G work as partners pretty much from the first moment. The flashback gives some necessary history without interfering with the flow.Hetty is a pleasure. I already know I'm going to like this episode after only a few minutes. Linda Hunt excels.The back and forth between Sam and G is entertaining, natural. The looks they exchange hint at an intriguing shared history we aren't yet privy to. There is understated humor that fits in rather than interferes, no forced laughter, rather, a knowing, mutual smirk.Kensi Blye, young, attractive, competent and well established part of the team. Dom, inexperienced, smart and more than a little naive. Eric, the requisite tech expert to dazzle us. I have tech/gadget envy already. Nate, psychologist and eager to be a field agent, keen observer of behavioral clues. I like that physical beauty is not the norm here, most of the cast look like real people you could encounter anywhere.The case held my interest, the twists weren't hard to follow.

1344343,A30LJURWZVJHR7,B003FSTN5C,"R. B. McCord ""Sylencer""","[14, 29]","To start with I am a fan of JAG and NCIS and this review will be spoiler free.  I have watched probably 90% of both shows and when I heard about the spinoff and saw the teaser episode in NCIS I was intrigued enough to give LA a chance.  I should point out that I went into NCIS LA knowing that Bellisario was not working directly with it and this was going to be a different show than NCIS.  Basically I went in hoping for another show to watch and enjoy.  I can't say that really happened.First off we have plenty of actors with experience under their belts and crime drama with cool new technology....  Too bad the plots, back-story, and character interactions are flubbed with great abandon.  Chris O'Donnell, who acts as G. Callen, plays a very interesting character with some depth and his ""partner"" LL Cool J, who acts as Sam Hanna, also comes across well... but it falls flat when they interact as friends and I don't really see much chemistry.  Things feel strained all over and scenes get stretched far too many times.  When they brought Director Vance in for two episodes I seriously was wondering where the plot went and was sorely disturbed to see that while the actors were good at portraying themselves they were bad at interacting with one another.  From the pyschologist to the computer nerd I saw fleshed out characters but it was like the actors could not bring them to life around the other characters.  Linda Hunt was really the only character I liked and that was mostly from nostalgia.  Now someone who enjoys the show will say that with time these things will work themselves out... but half a season later I am still seeing bad plots and character interaction.  There were times when characters would literally walk on que into a scene JUST as they were about to be talked about or announced like the stork brought them.NCIS was tighter and moved better.  I realize that stereotypes are unavoidable in tv shows, and the original NCIS certainly has many, but I can no longer see some of the characters beyond that.  Besides Sam, Hetty, and Callen the other characters are the pyschologist, computer nerd, rookie, and eye candy ( tho she has surprised me on a few occasions ).  That's pretty sad in general but worse for a show I want to keep watching.  Because I really did want to keep watching NCIS LA but in the end there really isn't much difference than what you would get with NCIS or another crime drama.  NCIS worked because it was quirky and had interesting characters, even if it did become way too formulaic.  And when NCIS could pull some amazing story archs it kept you watching the mediocre ones.  I think NCIS LA brought too much stereotypical quirky and not enough cohesion.Pile all this on with unrealistic plots and plot devices and I found it very hard to suspend my disbelief while watching the show.  It had its moments here and there but in the end I stopped watching this entirely.I recommend renting this before you buy it.  You should be able to tell in a few episodes if this will be for you.  I gave this half a season to catch my interest and it failed but some may still find this enjoyable if they can look past the flaws.",3,N.C.I.S.
