That's correct, this masterpiece is worse than the worst film made in the last 15 years. That is quite an accomplishment.This mess starts off with the long, boring story detailing the origin of the villain of this film; the short guy with the dirty beard who runs around with a knife. He is supposed to be some evil, immortal pirate who kills anybody who:a. is in his field of vision, especially if you are wearing a skimpy bikini (I've never really found hoochies cut up and covered in their own blood attractive - obviously the director has this fetish)b. tries to steal his treasure (all pirates have treasures to guard - Arrrgh!)c. tries to prevent him from recovering his treasure (he lost it when he was imprisoned many years ago, before he became immortal. Arrrgh!)The victims are a group of idiots who are participating in a ""Survivor""-type show. They all decide to frolic on this short killer's island.What really shocked me about this poorly filmed, cheap D-grade movie was the incredibly racist portrayal of one of the pirate's victims - a rap star of course. All this guy needed was a Watermellon and a bucket of chicken. It was much worse than Coolio's ""performance"" in Dracula 3000.Skip this one at all costs.",1,Terrible from beginning to end.,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,1267,"['Crossbones', 'worse', 'Dracula', '3000', 'correct', 'masterpiece', 'worse', 'worst', 'film', 'made', 'last', '15', 'years', 'quite', 'accomplishment.This', 'mess', 'long', 'boring', 'story', 'detailing', 'origin', 'villain', 'film', 'short', 'guy', 'dirty', 'beard', 'who', 'knife', 'supposed', 'be', 'evil', 'immortal', 'pirate', 'who', 'anybody', 'who', 'a.', 'field', 'vision', 'especially', 'are', 'wearing', 'skimpy', 'bikini', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'found', 'hoochies', 'cut', 'up', 'covered', 'own', 'blood', 'attractive', 'obviously', 'director', 'fetish', 'b.', 'tries', 'steal', 'treasure', 'pirates', 'have', 'treasures', 'guard', 'Arrrgh', 'c', 'tries', 'prevent', 'recovering', 'treasure', 'lost', 'when', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'became', 'immortal', 'Arrrgh', 'victims', 'are', 'group', 'idiots', 'who', 'are', 'participating', 'Survivor', '-type', 'show', 'decide', 'frolic', 'short', 'killer', 'island.What', 'really', 'shocked', 'poorly', 'filmed', 'cheap', 'D-grade', 'movie', 'was', 'incredibly', 'racist', 'portrayal', 'one', 'pirate', 'victims', 'rap', 'star', 'course', 'guy', 'needed', 'was', 'Watermellon', 'bucket', 'chicken', 'was', 'much', 'worse', 'Coolio', 'performance', 'Dracula', '3000.Skip', 'one', 'costs']",Crossbones
914305,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0009W5JOQ,Michael Butts,"[14, 15]","CROSSBONES is an incredibly bad film that spends most of its time focusing on the bikini clad women and the profane behavior of some minor league rap star (J-Shin?).  At any rate, Joe Marino plays bloody pirate RedBeard, who is murdered by a bunch of natives in the beginning of the film, and placed under a blood curse.  A group of incredibly bad actors take over as members of a ""Survivor"" type tv show that looks about as exciting as spin the bottle.  Any attempt at plot coherence is shortshifted in the movie's attempts to parody reality shows, but there is no suspense or horror and Marino is especially bad as the vengeful pirate.  Truly another example of the degeneration of the horror genre.

914306,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0009W5JOQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Crossbones (Daniel Zirilli, 2005)I have seen some very, very bad movies over the course of my life. The very worst of them I have not been able to finish watching. The best thing I can say about Crossbones is that I did not turn it off in the middle.The plot, what little of it there is: A director and his bubbleheaded girlfriend take six young-and-beautifuls out to a desert island for a reality show. (You may get a small amount of amusement out of the fact that three of the actors here did, in fact, appear on reality YV shows-- Jessie Camacho on Survivor, Maria Santos on Temptation Island, and Hardy-Ames Hill on Big Brother. I, unfortunately, did not know this until after I saw the movie.) While there, they raise a bloodthirsty pirate who's under a blood curse (and the scene in which said pirate is put under said curse is so nakedly offensive I'm amazed the movie was released intact), who sets about the business of all immortal pirates, which is killing people and recovering his long-buried booty. Of course. There is a minor, painfully ill-handled, love-story subplot between the two alpha Y-and-Bs that can be safely ignored.I'm relatively sure I put this on the list of movies I wanted to see this year solely because the director's name begins with Z, and I was looking to hit every letter of the alphabet. (Note, if you attempt the same thing: there do not seem to be any directors in the history of filmdom whose last names begin with X. Not even in China.) It certainly couldn't have been because I heard good reviews; I've been looking, and there aren't any. In fact, I'd have to say this is the worst-reviewed movie I've ever come across. I haven't even found a single positive comment from the entire IMDB peanut gallery as relates to this mess of a movie. And all of these people, from the professional critics to the occasional commenters who see three movies a year, are absolutely correct. This movie is relentlessly, brutally, mind-shatteringly awful in every possible way. The acting is atrocious, the production values are lower than microbudget, the direction is wooden, the script could have been thought up in an hour and a half by two ten-year-olds on a sterno binge (though they would have added some welcome nudity, probably), the special effects are anything but special. I have to give it grudging respect for the sound transfer being better-mixed than most big-budget Hollywood blockbusters, but upon reflection that could be because there's so little foley work in this movie that there's really nothing to screw up in the remixing of the soundtrack. If ever there were a movie that deserved zero stars, Crossbones is it.

It is a decent low budget film, but not great.  I thought the main character, the pirate was a bit weak, they should have picked an actor with more screen presence. The plot was easy enough to follow, in fact it made me think of a Sci-Fy channel film done on a super low budget. I may have been too generous with the third star, but I recommend it because it is fun. I would call it a C film not a B film as well. Hey I paid less than a dollar for it here.

Yes, that's a pretty cover on that dvd case, and the skull picture on the disc itself is kind of cool, and that's about it.  I always lower my expectations of ""certain"" movies, and that way I'm not too disappointed, but this one was a painful experience that leaves me grasping for a single positive moment in this colossal waste of time.I am fortunate that I did not plunk my hard-earned five dollars to rent this, and if you intend to wait for it to be cheaper, don't bother.  I'd pay money to get this 88 minutes of my life back.  Those four chicks in bikinis aren't worth it - you can see better stuff on network television, so don't use that as an excuse.  There was one person in a voodoo ritual whose real name is Putty Tat, so that got my attention, and one line of dialogue (""I wish I had more time to spend with you"") that was absolutely hysterical in that context.  I don't know why, I just know that the Significant Other and I burst out laughing at that one (but it's not worth watching the whole movie to hear it, really.)So, I see that this treasure is up for sale for the whopping price of 33 cent butthen there's postage, so you shouldn't bother.
