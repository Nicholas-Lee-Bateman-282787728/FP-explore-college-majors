1334548,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0039ZF87I,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Thirst is probably the second worst movie I've seen this year.  I'll have to go back and painfully remember the *very* worst movie I've watched this year, but needless to say, Thirst definitely deserves the number two spot without even giving it a second thought.A movie about four young adults that get stranded out in the desert.  Though a simplistic and not very detail-oriented storyline, you'd think such a plot couldn't possibly go horribly wrong, right?  WRONG!  This is dreadful.  Absolutely pathetic in fact.  For whatever highly bizarre reason, the acting is comparable to high school kids imitating a soap opera, and the young adults sit around and talk like a bunch of young adults talking about career aspirations and relationships.  Trust me if you're concerned you might die, you won't stop to rationally discuss the future.The picture quality is really pour, dark and low budget.  The acting is bad and I don't care about the characters in the slightest.  Why would I?  They're all incredibly generic.  All the wrong ingredients thrown in a pot to present one atrocious film overall.  You almost have to laugh when one of the girls dies because the girl trying to save her is acting so unbelievably atrociously by giving her generic advice on how to stay alive that you can't help but snicker.  Oh and the rattlesnake that slithers near the girl (rather unrealistically)... the boyfriend smacking the snake to death with a rock was just awful.  Obviously he's swinging at nothing at all.I suppose, just to be nice, the final 10 minutes isn't *that* bad.  Oh sure the boyfriend expresses way too much emotion and turns into a pathetic mess of tears that adds more to the soap opera theme that Thirst annoyingly features, but the scene with a swimming pool/wolf involving the one girl having to wake up in time for the purpose of saving her and the baby is actually pretty good.  As is the ending.  Of course you know how it's going to end but still, not bad.  Amazing!If anyone can explain what kind of movie producers/writers actually think this passes for acceptable viewing material, please let me know who they are so I can tell them how I feel about the poor quality of their work.

1334549,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B0039ZF87I,California Dreaming,"[0, 1]","While watching, I actually drank at least a six pack of Diet Pepsi.  I'm not kidding, and no, I don't much like Coke, unless of course it's that diet Cherry kind.  But anyways, while guzzling drink after drink and watching scene after scene, I actually thought to myself, ""If I could sell this six pack to the actors in this film -- assuming they were really in the desert and they were really thirsty -- I'll bet that I could pay cash for a second house!""  Err, not that I would price gouge, of course.  That wouldn't be nice.And more than likely, most viewers won't find this film very nice, I'm assuming.  It reminded me of ""127 Hours"" in a way, although I believe that that film was based upon a true story while this was probably fictitious.  And usually I find these types of films less than nice myself, as they are usually very difficult to watch.  You just know going in that bad thing after bad thing will happen to the protagonists in the film, and you also know that if there are any survivors, there will usually only be one.  And sometimes, while watching, you think, ""Well that survivor would have been luckier if he or she died at the beginning,"" at least after taking another sip off that Pepsi and shaking your head.I did get a few minor laughs though.  One of the gals in the film plays a model, and let's just say she makes an unintended sacrifice that everyone else in the group should be happy about, as it means that the rest of the group will have a bigger ""share.""  And in another very ironic scene, you find that that same model might actually have saved someone else by earlier having what may be deemed as ""unnecessary surgery.""  So it's not all doom and gloom here.Early on I noticed Tygh Runyan, an actor that played Randall Woodfield -- a real-life serial killer who briefly played for the Packers -- in the film ""The Hunt for the I-5 Killer.""  Mr. Runyan surely plays a more sympathetic character here, and at one point he makes a sacrifice as well, similar to the model.  I found this scene to be slightly cheesy, with undertones -- or overtones, take your pick -- of religiosity.  I laughed during that scene even though I believe that was not the director's intent, so that was most likely a misfire.Well, while sipping another Pepsi and writing this review, I came up with a possible reason that ""Thirst"" was green-lighted:  concession sales have been low lately, and theater owners want them to be increased.  This film surely would do that.  I watched this at home, but if I'd been in the theater, I figure I would have dropped at least 20 bucks.  And that would have been only on the Pepsis.",3,Get me another Pepsi and an IV!,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,2630,"['watching', 'actually', 'drank', 'least', 'six', 'pack', 'Diet', 'Pepsi', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'Coke', 'course', 'diet', 'Cherry', 'kind', 'anyways', 'guzzling', 'drink', 'drink', 'watching', 'scene', 'scene', 'actually', 'thought', 'myself', 'could', 'sell', 'six', 'pack', 'actors', 'film', 'assuming', 'were', 'really', 'desert', 'were', 'really', 'thirsty', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'could', 'pay', 'cash', 'second', 'house', 'Err', 'not', 'would', 'price', 'gouge', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nice.And', 'more', 'likely', 'most', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'very', 'nice', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'reminded', '127', 'Hours', 'way', 'believe', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'was', 'probably', 'fictitious', 'usually', 'find', 'types', 'films', 'less', 'nice', 'are', 'usually', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'just', 'know', 'going', 'bad', 'thing', 'bad', 'thing', 'will', 'happen', 'protagonists', 'film', 'also', 'know', 'are', 'survivors', 'will', 'usually', 'only', 'be', 'one', 'sometimes', 'watching', 'think', 'Well', 'survivor', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'luckier', 'died', 'beginning', 'least', 'taking', 'sip', 'Pepsi', 'shaking', 'head.I', 'did', 'get', 'few', 'minor', 'laughs', 'One', 'gals', 'film', 'model', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'unintended', 'sacrifice', 'everyone', 'else', 'group', 'should', 'be', 'happy', 'about', 'rest', 'group', 'will', 'have', 'bigger', 'share', 'very', 'ironic', 'scene', 'find', 'same', 'model', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'saved', 'someone', 'else', 'earlier', 'having', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'deemed', 'unnecessary', 'surgery', 'not', 'doom', 'gloom', 'here.Early', 'noticed', 'Tygh', 'Runyan', 'actor', 'played', 'Randall', 'Woodfield', 'real-life', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'briefly', 'played', 'Packers', 'film', 'Hunt', 'I-5', 'Killer', 'Mr.', 'Runyan', 'surely', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'here', 'one', 'point', 'sacrifice', 'as', 'well', 'similar', 'model', 'found', 'scene', 'be', 'slightly', 'cheesy', 'undertones', 'overtones', 'take', 'pick', 'religiosity', 'laughed', 'scene', 'even', 'believe', 'was', 'not', 'director', 'intent', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'misfire.Well', 'sipping', 'Pepsi', 'writing', 'review', 'came', 'up', 'possible', 'reason', 'Thirst', 'was', 'green-lighted', 'concession', 'sales', 'have', 'been', 'low', 'lately', 'theater', 'owners', 'want', 'be', 'increased', 'film', 'surely', 'would', 'do', 'watched', 'home', ""'d"", 'been', 'theater', 'figure', 'would', 'have', 'dropped', 'least', '20', 'bucks', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'Pepsis']",Thirst
1334550,A6J7UPYUI96XO,B0039ZF87I,"Cory T. Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[26, 28]","This film is very similar in concept to the film ""Open Water,"" except that there is a total lack of water, ironically, because the four characters get stranded in the desert. The film features basically only the four main characters, with Lacey Chabert in the lead role. Chabert gives an emotionally charged, convincing performance as the characters fight for survival and prove just how far they are willing to go to save themselves and each other.Without giving spoilers away, this film is highly entertaining, and the lengths that the characters are willing to go is astounding as they are forced to make unthinkable decisions as they face the possible fate of dying in the desert of thirst. If you have read Jack London's ""To Build a Fire"" or you are a big fan of ""Open Water"" then you will adore this film. If you are looking for a ""slasher"" flick, look elsewhere. This is about as far from being a slasher film as you can get, but there are elements of terror present. The producers could have chosen to make this movie exceptionally graphic and unpleasant (and at times, it is) but overall, they took the high road and ended up with an above-average movie. This would make for an excellent rental, and I would even suggest purchasing it for fans who like this type of film.I searched high and low for a review of this film, but I could not find one anywhere, so I wanted to make sure I took the time to review it in detail but not give too much away.

I can't fault that here though because when people get severely dehydrated and overheated common sense is the first thing to go and bad choices are precisely what happens. In this case they only make things more realistic. Some of the choices are most surprising and the end is satisfactory.

Things go horribly wrong when their car crashes after nearly hitting a wolf.  The overall idea of ""Thirst"" has been done many times before: nobody knows they are out there and no one will notice their absence for days.  There is hope, however.  Their map shows a town to the west that they could try walking to.  But the desert is merciless, and there are only so many bottles of water to ration among themselves.  It was at this point that the movie happily diverged from my expectations.  I expected the characters to turn on each other.  After all, this is a horror movie!  And, indeed, there is some of that.  For example, after one of the characters dies, the remaining characters argue over who should get the dead person's water.  However, the negative aspects of human nature are not the ultimate focus of ""Thirst.""  Instead, we are given likable characters who go to great lengths to try to save each other, though at times quite futilely.  Yes, this is a horror movie--characters do meet their deaths in rather violent and gruesome ways (although it not excessively shown).  But, in the process, we are shown a side of human nature that is sometimes quite moving.  You will have to suspend disbelief at times, as a few rather unlikely things will occur.

1334563,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0039ZF87I,trebe,"[7, 8]","The setup is simple, and the plot meandering and not terribly realistic in Thirst (2010), where two couples face a crisis situation in the desert.  Major spoilers follow, so proceed at your own discretion.Tyson (Brandon Quinn), a fashion photographer, is headed off to a remote desert location to do a photo shoot with Atheria (Mercedes McNab) a model.  Also along are Tyson's friend Bryan (Tygh Runyan), and his wife Noelle (Lacey Chabert) who is studying to be a doctor.  The group travels deep into the desert, and begins the photo shoot.  While looking for a new location, their vehicle runs off the road, and Atheria is injured.  With their vehicle undrivable and no cell phone service (of course), the group faces a situation they are totally unprepared for.  Noelle reveals that she is pregnant, which heightens the couple's drive to survive.The intent of the film, is to show the outrageous acts people will do, when under extreme pressure.  The first of which is some makeshift ""brain surgery"", involving Noelle taking a screwdriver to Atheria skull, even though she has no definite knowledge where the pressure on her brain may be.  Evidently Noelle is unaware of the Hippocratic oath, which includes taking no action that may harm a patient, or engaging in a practice without being qualified.  It is a pretty effective scene, but unfortunately the model does not survive, and after burying her body, the three survivors decide to try and walk to safety.This is where the film really starts to lose credibility.  The group came into the desert totally unprepared, with only a bag of chips, and some bottles of water.  No one wears their sunglasses or hats, and Noelle heads off into the desert, wearing a sleeveless blouse and slippers.  These people should be severely dehydrated and sunburned after a few hours, and Noelle's feet should be rubbed raw, but it doesn't happen in the days that follow.  Throughout their journey, the survivors look much too healthy.  They manage to kill a rattlesnake and drink its blood, but then instead of keeping it for food, they throw it away.The trek through the desert, is mostly a series of unrelated scenes connected together, where the geography doesn't really match up.  Instead of travelling during the cooler parts of the day as they say is their intention, they often seem to be on the move when the sun is high overhead.  The gross out moments, that are largely what this film is about, continue, as Noelle and Bryan drink their own urine, and later even more shocking, Noelle turns into a vampire.  In the end, the hapless travelers somehow manage the impossible, arriving at the same place they left.With Lacey Chalbert as one of the executive producers, it's hardly surprising that mother-to-be Noelle, survives.  Only at the very end, does she even look as dirty, sun baked, and dehydrated as she should have much earlier.  There is a nice twist, where a breast implant of all things, plays a key role in her survival.  The actors do the best with what they have, and the performances are actually pretty good, as the characters are not complete morons.  The film's problems are mostly related to the location, and the way the scenes are edited together doesn't always make for a very believable story.  While it's possible for a group to be so totally unprepared, it's not likely that they would have survived as long as these people did.With an emphasis on the different fluids that the survivors drink, Thirst does live up to its name.  Besides walking in the desert, there really isn't much action to speak of.  The film has solid production values, and the desert cinematography is a plus, although if you pay attention to it, the continuity between scenes often does not match, as they appear to be shot at different times of the day.  It's hard to control lighting on location, and it appears to be too much of a challenge here.  Still, if you block out all the unrealistic elements, and just take it for what it is intended to be, a look at the extreme things people will do to survive, Thirst does have some entertainment value.",3,the things you will drink to stay alive...,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,4099,"['setup', 'simple', 'plot', 'meandering', 'not', 'terribly', 'realistic', 'Thirst', '2010', 'where', 'two', 'couples', 'face', 'crisis', 'situation', 'desert', 'Major', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'so', 'proceed', 'own', 'discretion.Tyson', 'Brandon', 'Quinn', 'fashion', 'photographer', 'headed', 'off', 'remote', 'desert', 'location', 'do', 'photo', 'shoot', 'Atheria', 'Mercedes', 'McNab', 'model', 'Also', 'along', 'are', 'Tyson', 'friend', 'Bryan', 'Tygh', 'Runyan', 'wife', 'Noelle', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'who', 'studying', 'be', 'doctor', 'group', 'deep', 'desert', 'photo', 'shoot', 'looking', 'new', 'location', 'vehicle', 'road', 'Atheria', 'injured', 'vehicle', 'undrivable', 'cell', 'phone', 'service', 'course', 'group', 'situation', 'are', 'totally', 'unprepared', 'Noelle', 'pregnant', 'couple', 'drive', 'survive.The', 'intent', 'film', 'show', 'outrageous', 'acts', 'people', 'will', 'do', 'when', 'extreme', 'pressure', 'first', 'makeshift', 'brain', 'surgery', 'involving', 'Noelle', 'taking', 'screwdriver', 'Atheria', 'skull', 'even', 'definite', 'knowledge', 'where', 'pressure', 'brain', 'may', 'be', 'Evidently', 'Noelle', 'unaware', 'Hippocratic', 'oath', 'taking', 'action', 'may', 'harm', 'patient', 'engaging', 'practice', 'being', 'qualified', 'pretty', 'effective', 'scene', 'unfortunately', 'model', 'not', 'survive', 'burying', 'body', 'three', 'survivors', 'decide', 'try', 'walk', 'safety.This', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'lose', 'credibility', 'group', 'came', 'desert', 'totally', 'unprepared', 'only', 'bag', 'chips', 'bottles', 'water', 'one', 'sunglasses', 'hats', 'Noelle', 'heads', 'off', 'desert', 'wearing', 'sleeveless', 'blouse', 'slippers', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'severely', 'dehydrated', 'sunburned', 'few', 'hours', 'Noelle', 'feet', 'should', 'be', 'rubbed', 'raw', ""n't"", 'happen', 'days', 'follow', 'journey', 'survivors', 'look', 'much', 'too', 'healthy', 'manage', 'kill', 'rattlesnake', 'drink', 'blood', 'then', 'instead', 'keeping', 'food', 'throw', 'away.The', 'trek', 'desert', 'mostly', 'series', 'unrelated', 'scenes', 'connected', 'together', 'where', 'geography', ""n't"", 'really', 'match', 'up', 'Instead', 'travelling', 'cooler', 'parts', 'day', 'say', 'intention', 'often', 'seem', 'be', 'move', 'when', 'sun', 'high', 'overhead', 'gross', 'moments', 'are', 'largely', 'what', 'film', 'continue', 'Noelle', 'Bryan', 'drink', 'own', 'urine', 'later', 'even', 'more', 'shocking', 'Noelle', 'vampire', 'end', 'hapless', 'travelers', 'somehow', 'manage', 'impossible', 'arriving', 'same', 'place', 'left.With', 'Lacey', 'Chalbert', 'one', 'executive', 'producers', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'mother-to-be', 'Noelle', 'Only', 'very', 'end', 'even', 'look', 'dirty', 'sun', 'baked', 'dehydrated', 'should', 'have', 'much', 'earlier', 'nice', 'twist', 'where', 'breast', 'implant', 'things', 'key', 'role', 'survival', 'actors', 'do', 'best', 'what', 'have', 'performances', 'are', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'complete', 'morons', 'film', 'problems', 'are', 'mostly', 'related', 'location', 'way', 'scenes', 'are', 'edited', 'together', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'very', 'believable', 'story', 'possible', 'group', 'be', 'so', 'totally', 'unprepared', 'not', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'survived', 'as', 'long', 'people', 'did.With', 'emphasis', 'different', 'fluids', 'survivors', 'drink', 'Thirst', 'live', 'up', 'name', 'walking', 'desert', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'action', 'speak', 'film', 'solid', 'production', 'values', 'desert', 'cinematography', 'plus', 'pay', 'attention', 'continuity', 'scenes', 'often', 'not', 'match', 'appear', 'be', 'shot', 'different', 'times', 'day', 'hard', 'control', 'lighting', 'location', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'challenge', 'here', 'Still', 'block', 'out', 'unrealistic', 'elements', 'just', 'take', 'what', 'intended', 'be', 'look', 'extreme', 'things', 'people', 'will', 'do', 'survive', 'Thirst', 'have', 'entertainment', 'value']",Thirst
