1383650,A190T7MZ2GTJ2G,B0042RJWU6,Bri,"[0, 0]","2nd time around, Brenda got it right. When the season first aired on The CW Sunday, I disagreed like everyone else. I remember watching the series finale and thinking back to how ridiculous this season was. And it still is, don't get me wrong. Season 10 was supposed to be the final season, `And Thank You' the final episode. Then, by a stroke of luck, The CW wanted to save it and bring it back for 13 episodes - us fans were lucky and got way more than that, I believe we got a full season order, 22 episodes, not entirely sure - and I'm glad they did.Season 11 was good - not great, but good. It is probably my favorite season. This year, the show felt way more calmer, more relaxed, probably since all the cast was gone, minus Lucy and Kevin (Ruthie and Annie missed some episodes), and only a few new characters were brought in b/c otherwise there would no storylines (Martin and Sandy made appearances here and there throughout. When re- introduced, Mac also became a regular this year which was awsemow.) In the 2nd episode, I believe (it's been awhile since I watched this season), Eric learns he has a heart condition from his doctor and does outrageous things such as camping outside with Sam & David on a school night, dressing like a teenager, wearing a baseball cap backwards, wearing sweats, and buying them hamsters. While taking them to the vet to get them looked at, he ponders telling Annie about his condition, based on the bill (funny).Meanwhile, Lucy deals with having a miscarriage, a storyline that makes her even more unlikeable then usual (I can't stand her when she acts like that - I understand why but come on, Luce! You're a grown woman with a baby, like you told Eric when you wanted to deliver the sermon in the Season 10 Premiere - how about you start acting like it?) and starts pulling away from Kevin, who just wants to help his wife in any way he can. Then we got newbies, new characters to juice up the storylines a bit. I grew to love the newbies: Jane, Margaret and T-Bone.With Ruthie away in Scotland, we also got more time to focus on the little ones, Sam and David, and a storyline that was actually funny, and awkward - Their third grade teacher, Ms. Margo, having a crush on Eric. The pass she made towards him in `A Pain In The Neck' had me cringing and wishing I could have just melted into my chair. I would have NEVER done what she did - show up unannounced at his house, make moves on him while his sons are still nearby, even if they're in another room, and most importantly while his wife is out of town whom he has 7 children with and has been madly in love with and married to for as long as anyone can remember. I mean, who does that?! Unless you want to be labeled a home wrecker.After getting Ms. Margo fired, and Eric coming clean about his heart condition (he only has one year to live) to Annie, (I didn't mention that because I kinda don't care that much about it in the first few episodes), the both of them fly to Scotland to bring Ruthie back home. Ruthie grew up while in Scotland, making friends (though we never learn who they are) and is extremely angry and frustrated at Eric and Annie for returning her to the place she so desperately wants to forget.Right away, she starts a relationship with T-Bone, whom a few days after her return, gives her a piece of his mind about what a brat she is (and Boy! Does Ruthie become a B.R.A.T this year) and winds up kissing her (they end up making out in the hallway w/Sam & David watching from inside one of the bedrooms). Eric and Annie are fine with it. I hate it though, because I believe it's maybe one episode after they get together, Ruthie informs T-Bone that she's ready to go all the way and asks him to get condoms. (WTF?!) After deciding not to have sex, Ruthie has another great idea: Tatoos! (again, WTF?) And not a washable tattoo, a REAL tattoo. She ends up going all out, getting his name in big letters across her back while he gets her initials on his ankle, due to his fear of needles (Man up T-Bone! but hey be happy - I still love you a thousand times more than Martin).Which brings me to Martin - I hate this guy with a passion. Did you hear me? I'll repeat it. I. HATE. MARTIN. BREWER. What a freakin JERK. In every single way possible. In the 2nd episode, he decides that he loves Sandy, wants to be with Sandy and only Sandy. Fine. I can deal with that, considering they were wanting to work things out for the sake of their son, Aaron, at the end of Season 10. They decided to get married - I don't think Martin even proposed to Sandy, just mentioned the idea? - and have Mac, Martin's best friend, perform the wedding ceremony or be the best man - I remember watching this scene, and only seeing Sandy in a wedding dress with a bouquet, Martin in a suit and Mac (don't remember what he was wearing) saying something that I don't remember. All I can say is thank goodness that Sandy turned this looser down - he doesn't deserve her.Towards the end of the season, the storylines shift back to Lucy and Kevin front and center with having them visit a small town called Crossroads and pondering whether or not to move their growing family there. This storyline was okay, I guess, didn't care about it one way or another, so eh.So with only about 3,4 episodes left, we have time to meet T-Bone's father (we had already met T-Bone's mother earlier on in the season), played by Diedrich Bader, who did a PHENOMINAL job in his role, in my personal opinion. I loved him. We also have time to see Margort and Mac get hot and heavy - (in one of the remaining few episodes, Margrot misinterprets Mac's motives about turning in her paper for English class as code for sex - Hilarious!!!), and Martin, being the major butt that he is, date both Ruthie and Jane (another girl who lives with the Camdens, whom I love but don't really remember having that much of a storyline other than she smoked and Eric wouldn't tolerate that while under his roof. (BTW, if you watch `The Replacements', the episode that introduces T-Bone, Jane and Margrot, who quickly become regulars even though they never showed up in the opening credits, bummer - be sure to watch when Eric takes Jane's cigarettes and drops them one-by-one down the garbage disposal - Hilarious!!!)In the final two episodes, Martin decides that he loves ONLY Ruthie (give me a freakin' break!) and confesses his love to her, praying that she'll take him back, after he treated her like crap all throughout Season 10 when she actually HAD feelings for him; Eric goes to the hospital and gets a `good-to-go-on-with-your-life' checkup from his doctor which causes him to sing `You Are My Sunshine' at the top of his lungs down the hospital aisles, while taking sick patients for strolls in their wheelchairs; and Lucy and Kevin announce joyfully that they're pregnanat again.So, all's well with The Camdens, which brings us to the Series Finale (for real this time), `And Away We Go'. As a present for Eric's clean health, The Cornel and Grandma Ruth send The Camdens a huge RV titled the `7th Heaven' - (have to mention I chocked on my soda while hearing/seeing that - could you really make it even MORE tackier than that, Brenda? I don't think so -and btw who names an RV? Not anyone I know) and Eric and Annie decided to take of tomorrow to `see America' as Annie puts it. The episode has time to tie up some loose ends-Ruthie turns the jerk-that-is-Martin down (Thank God!) for T-Bone, whom she realizes that she truly does love; Sandy and her boyfriend-doctor, Jonathon (he was rarely on the show having been introduced about 3,4 episodes earlier, mentioned a few times and actually only on the screen two episodes I believe) decide to join the Camdens; Lucy and Kevin decided to give Crossroads a shot, a small-town they visited a few episodes earlier, that needs a priest and a sheriff (wait a minute - isn't Lucy a priest and wasn't Kevin once on the police force?) How convient!!! (rolls eyes)); along with stopping at Simon's graduation (who has a surprise which fans never find out).Oh, and there's a rule for traveling in this RV. You're only allowed to bring 3 things, besides a suitcase. (WTF?) The episode closing moments are with Stanley, this homeless guy who appeared midway through the season, whom I also didn't like, sweet-talking Eric into letting him come along. Of course, Eric being the guy he is, lets him just climb on in back with the rest of the crowd. ""Why not?"" Eric says. ""Today's the first day of the rest of my life, Stanley"", before smiling in the mirror like an idiot.All in all, like I said, this season was okay. It had some funny, totally out-there moments, storylines, but that was to be expected, due to the fact that there was basically nothing left. I'll add it to my collection for the sake of it and to smile and laugh once in awhile.

1383662,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B0042RJWU6,MollyRK,"[27, 29]","I truly am impressed with the fact that the DVD manufacturers have managed to release all 11 seasons of this series on DVD. It took quite a while (Season 1 was released over 6 years ago, in September 2004), and the DVD's are not as high quality as fans might like (music changes and scene edits prevailed on most of the season sets), but this is still worth purchasing if you enjoyed this series during its run on television.I grew up with the Camdens, being introduced to them for the first time in fifth grade, and I continued to watch on and off until it came to a close during my college years. What makes Season 11 particularly unique is the fact that they fully intended to bow out after ten seasons. Heck, they even managed to get Jessica Biel back for a cameo appearance in that year's finale episode, and the entire original cast was present for those alleged ""last moments"". Then, out of nowhere, the show was renewed that summer for a record 11th season, and the most loyal cast members were more than eager to participate for as long as the network would keep them on the air. I remember thinking that they were absolutely crazy to resurrect the show at the last second, especially since the quality of the scripts had run thin years ago, but you have to admire the cast for valuing it all enough to jump at the chance for a revival. Sure, Barry Watson, Jessica Biel, and David Gallagher had moved on by then, but Stephen Collins, Catherine Hicks, Beverley Mitchell, Mackenzie Rosman, and George Stults were there in a heartbeat, and if nothing else, their passion for it is worth commending. Catherine Hicks even said that doing the show had become like a ""public service"", given the impact it had on so many people, and I thought that was a pretty good way to describe it.Again, though, series creator Brenda Hampton was left with very little to work with at this point, because let's face it--even the greatest shows have a tendency to run dry after a full decade of production. This year, they decided to go with a dramatic plummet in Eric's health. His heart had given him trouble at different times throughout the series, but now the writers were leaving audiences with a nagging question: is the beloved Camden patriarch headed toward a premature death? Always so affectionate toward his family and strong during rough times, his personality completely changed this season, ranging from frustrated to despondent, and the fact that he won't always confide in his own wife doesn't exactly help matters. Meanwhile, Lucy is coping with some emotional instability of her own after a miscarriage that strains her marriage and leads to questions over where her own family's future is headed. Rebellious 16-year-old Ruthie, who has somehow scored a semester of study in Scotland and quickly realizes that being thousands of miles away from her family is a pretty sweet deal. Once home, she makes some impulsive decisions of her own, including a tattoo on her lower back and a self-spread rumor around school that she has lost her virginity. (If you know Brenda Hampton, you know how obsessed she is with portraying sex on even her Christian-themed television shows.) Then there's Sam and David, who are now being home-schooled after Eric has an unfortunate run-in with their third grade teacher. That's pretty much all that's left of the original Camden family this season, so the writers add some new characters in the form of three homeless teenagers who move into their home. We also have Haylie Duff returning as teen mother Sandy, who continues to pursue a future in Christian ministry and occasionally butts heads with Lucy, who isn't too happy about sharing the spotlight with someone else. Also be on the lookout for a guest appearance from Alice Hirson as Annie's deceased mother in a Christmas episode that's supposed to tug at the heart strings, but loses itself in a storyline that is anything but plausible.I can't say this is 7th Heaven's greatest season (then again, what series is in its 11th season?) but it still has some good moments here and there, and if you've loved the show since the beginning, chances are you're just glad to see the characters back again. The values concerning religion and community prevail as always, although they have become pretty heavy-handed at this stage in the game. I admire the spiritual and family-based messages they tried to convey each week--it's just that they often did it in a manner that shoved it down the audience's throats and involved every single character in ridiculous ways that take away any chance at relatability. With all things considered, though, I look forward to adding it to my collection in November and enjoying the episodes once again.",3,Worth owning to complete your collection,1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,4727,"['truly', 'am', 'impressed', 'fact', 'DVD', 'manufacturers', 'have', 'managed', 'release', '11', 'seasons', 'series', 'DVD', 'took', 'quite', 'while', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'released', '6', 'years', 'ago', 'September', '2004', 'DVD', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'high', 'quality', 'fans', 'might', 'like', 'music', 'changes', 'scene', 'edits', 'prevailed', 'most', 'season', 'sets', 'still', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'run', 'television.I', 'grew', 'up', 'Camdens', 'being', 'introduced', 'first', 'time', 'fifth', 'grade', 'continued', 'watch', 'came', 'close', 'college', 'years', 'What', 'Season', '11', 'particularly', 'unique', 'fact', 'fully', 'intended', 'bow', 'out', 'ten', 'seasons', 'Heck', 'even', 'managed', 'get', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'back', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'year', 'finale', 'episode', 'entire', 'original', 'cast', 'was', 'present', 'alleged', 'last', 'moments', 'Then', 'nowhere', 'show', 'was', 'renewed', 'summer', 'record', '11th', 'season', 'most', 'loyal', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'more', 'eager', 'participate', 'as', 'long', 'network', 'would', 'keep', 'air', 'remember', 'thinking', 'were', 'absolutely', 'crazy', 'resurrect', 'show', 'last', 'second', 'especially', 'quality', 'scripts', 'had', 'run', 'thin', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'admire', 'cast', 'valuing', 'enough', 'jump', 'chance', 'revival', 'Sure', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'David', 'Gallagher', 'had', 'moved', 'then', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'Catherine', 'Hicks', 'Beverley', 'Mitchell', 'Mackenzie', 'Rosman', 'George', 'Stults', 'were', 'there', 'heartbeat', 'nothing', 'else', 'passion', 'worth', 'commending', 'Catherine', 'Hicks', 'even', 'said', 'doing', 'show', 'had', 'become', 'public', 'service', 'given', 'impact', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'way', 'describe', 'it.Again', 'though', 'series', 'creator', 'Brenda', 'Hampton', 'was', 'left', 'very', 'little', 'work', 'point', 'let', 'face', 'even', 'greatest', 'shows', 'have', 'tendency', 'run', 'dry', 'full', 'decade', 'production', 'year', 'decided', 'go', 'dramatic', 'plummet', 'Eric', 'health', 'heart', 'had', 'given', 'trouble', 'different', 'times', 'series', 'now', 'writers', 'were', 'leaving', 'audiences', 'nagging', 'question', 'beloved', 'Camden', 'patriarch', 'headed', 'premature', 'death', 'Always', 'so', 'affectionate', 'family', 'strong', 'rough', 'times', 'personality', 'completely', 'changed', 'season', 'ranging', 'frustrated', 'despondent', 'fact', 'wo', ""n't"", 'always', 'confide', 'own', 'wife', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'help', 'matters', 'Meanwhile', 'Lucy', 'coping', 'emotional', 'instability', 'own', 'miscarriage', 'marriage', 'questions', 'where', 'own', 'family', 'future', 'headed', 'Rebellious', '16-year-old', 'Ruthie', 'who', 'somehow', 'scored', 'semester', 'study', 'Scotland', 'quickly', 'being', 'thousands', 'miles', 'away', 'family', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'deal', 'Once', 'home', 'impulsive', 'decisions', 'own', 'including', 'tattoo', 'lower', 'back', 'self-spread', 'rumor', 'school', 'lost', 'virginity', 'know', 'Brenda', 'Hampton', 'know', 'how', 'obsessed', 'portraying', 'sex', 'even', 'Christian-themed', 'television', 'shows', 'Then', 'Sam', 'David', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'being', 'home-schooled', 'Eric', 'unfortunate', 'run-in', 'third', 'grade', 'teacher', 'pretty', 'much', 'left', 'original', 'Camden', 'family', 'season', 'writers', 'add', 'new', 'characters', 'form', 'three', 'homeless', 'teenagers', 'who', 'move', 'home', 'also', 'have', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'returning', 'teen', 'mother', 'Sandy', 'who', 'pursue', 'future', 'Christian', 'ministry', 'occasionally', 'butts', 'heads', 'Lucy', 'who', ""n't"", 'too', 'happy', 'sharing', 'spotlight', 'someone', 'else', 'Also', 'be', 'lookout', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Alice', 'Hirson', 'Annie', 'deceased', 'mother', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'supposed', 'tug', 'heart', 'strings', 'storyline', 'anything', 'plausible.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', '7th', 'Heaven', 'greatest', 'season', 'then', 'again', 'what', 'series', '11th', 'season', 'still', 'good', 'moments', 'here', 'there', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'show', 'beginning', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'just', 'glad', 'see', 'characters', 'back', 'again', 'values', 'concerning', 'religion', 'community', 'prevail', 'always', 'have', 'become', 'pretty', 'heavy-handed', 'stage', 'game', 'admire', 'spiritual', 'family-based', 'messages', 'tried', 'convey', 'week', 'just', 'often', 'did', 'manner', 'shoved', 'down', 'audience', 'throats', 'involved', 'single', 'character', 'ridiculous', 'ways', 'take', 'away', 'chance', 'relatability', 'things', 'considered', 'look', 'forward', 'adding', 'collection', 'November', 'enjoying', 'episodes', 'once', 'again']",N/A
