It starts somewhat promising with a great looking French guy talking directly to us, the viewing audience, and that was original.  It went downhill from there.  Towards the end of the movie some heartfelt things were said but just for a moment and then never elaborated on.  Worst is the ending which was a non ending; just looked like another scene another conversation and zap (mercifully) it's over.  If you like a movie that looks like every mundane detail of real life this is for you.  Sadly, not enough footage of the actual city..Paris is so beautiful and there were some incredible glimpses here and there and I watched it all just for that alone.",3,PRETTY BAD,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,820,"['am', 'beginning', 'admitting', 'love', 'Paris', 'love', 'French', 'therefore', 'am', 'biased', 'begin', 'even', 'so', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'probably', 'two', 'star', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'promising', 'great', 'looking', 'French', 'guy', 'talking', 'directly', 'viewing', 'audience', 'was', 'original', 'went', 'downhill', 'there', 'end', 'movie', 'heartfelt', 'things', 'were', 'said', 'just', 'moment', 'then', 'never', 'elaborated', 'Worst', 'ending', 'was', 'non', 'ending', 'just', 'looked', 'scene', 'conversation', 'zap', 'mercifully', 'over', 'like', 'movie', 'mundane', 'detail', 'real', 'life', 'Sadly', 'not', 'enough', 'footage', 'actual', 'city..Paris', 'so', 'beautiful', 'were', 'incredible', 'glimpses', 'here', 'there', 'watched', 'just', 'alone']",Dans Paris
1110706,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000WMFZME,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 4]","I'm going to start out by saying that I really liked ""Dans Paris"" although I'm not particularly sure that it is a cohesive, or even a very good, movie. Louis Garrel is a compelling young actor who has made some interesting choices, and it was his presence here that drew me to the film. However, those who might complain about the plot's ambiguity or the lack of a plot altogether are not off base. A throwback to the French New Wave movement, ""Dans Paris"" seems more successful as an experience than as a narrative. Although there are many subjects to explore--family disintegration, marital strife, siblings reconnecting as adults, psychosexual politics, depression and suicide--the film ultimately floats along like a breezy entertainment never really examining anything in depth.When Paul (Romain Duris) separates from his wife, he returns to Paris to live with his father and brother (Garrel). Paul's instability and attempts to harm himself are a major concern as the family has already been ripped apart by a previous incident of suicide. In the healing process, Paul must learn to communicate with his estranged wife Anna and reconnect with a mother he hardly sees. Compelling stuff, to be sure, but it's approached from unexpected angles. I'm still not sure why the story is presented from Garrel's viewpoint and why he breaks the fourth wall to speak directly to the viewer. That's a terrific device--but only when employed with a purpose.The film does have its charms, however. The final scenes between the brothers are sweet and surprisingly touching. In these simple moments, you can see flashes of a great movie! I also found a strange musical interlude between Paul and Anna absolutely captivating and heartfelt. And then there's Garrel. I'm not sure what movie he is in but it doesn't always seem to be ""Dans Paris."" His sexual exploits have an attractive whimsy but seem disconnected from the principle story line. But he's so appealing, you might not care (although he should bathe between interludes, it's only polite)! A recommendation from me, but if you're new to this genre--I'd recommend you start with the classics of New Wave.

1110707,A129YBX5BVNW2,B000WMFZME,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[10, 35]","Only the French.I mean, I wish to God they ""didn't"" live up to every clich&eacute; chucked at their cinema making, but this is absolute pretentious dross on a scale that is difficult to believe.Every joke about French cinema is painfully evident on 'Inside Paris' - the semi naked sexless actress talking deeply about life and philosophy as her ludicrous lover does his tie and is contemptuous of her in that stupid male French way. Then of course he can't live without her - so he cries - he tries suicide, but unfortunately for us all, it doesn't work. His brother is a feckless idiot. The men are so weak and whiny in this movie; you just want to smack them over the head with a copper-bottomed frying pan. Characters talk to the camera and look at the audience for no discernible reason. The story (what there is of one) is about obsession - when the only obsession you have is with the fast-forward button on the remote control - please find me some redeeming factor - please - and of course - your remote can't find any - because they're not there. Your remote control tries to empathize with you by giving a sympathetic look - suckered again - eh pal!In some respects this film's awfulness isn't funny. There have been superb French films in the last few years - of course there has - ""La Vie En Rose"", ""36"", ""Moliere"" and ""8 Women"" spring to mind - but this movie is one of the very real reasons why French cinema is greeted not with interest - but with a snigger and a titter. Which is a crying shame. It really is. Marion Cotillard has taken an award for ""La Vie En Rose"" and it's not surprising - it's simply one of the most astonishing performances given in cinema in 20 years! I kid you not! So why, oh why, do the French then go and produce obvious pretentious dross like this?? There's a scene where the obsessed man phones his woman and (wait for it) they 'sing' (yes sing) some 'philosophy' down the phone - as each actor tries desperately to look like this is normal and very deep!

1110710,A2ZHSORK1HHYTT,B000WMFZME,Willy D. Reviewer,"[3, 8]","The French are self-absorbed in dramas that deal with couples breaking up.  It seems to be a national fixation in the French film industry.In these films, it doesn't matter which partner is to blame, it is the same rehashed script:  Silence between the couple tells the audience that they are passive/aggressively fighting.  Then the couple improvs a few lines.  Next, family members have to give their opinions (and they have their short-comings too).  Then everyone improvs more lines.  Typical dialog in films like this: Him ""Do you still love me?"" (pause) Her ""I don't know.  Do you still love me?"" (pause) Him ""Would it make a difference?"" (pause) Her ""Would it make a difference to you?"" (pause) Him ""I don't know."" (pause) Her ""Neither do I."" pause...French directors always like to do close-ups on the faces: ""More can be said with a subtle raise of your eyebrow, than two pages of dialog"".  That may be, but oh please, give us good dialog and quit the rapid cutting from face to face -- their expressions are blank!By the time you are finished with a French film like this one, you definitely understand that the cast and director started off with an ""idea"" -- a couple breaking up -- and ad libbed it from there.
