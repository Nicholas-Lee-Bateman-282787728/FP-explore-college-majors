I have only few minuses for the movie, I personally disliked. I do not encourage any bad feedbacks, because it's my personal taste. And the movie is great, therefore, I encourage you to watch it!I CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT PART! I want to see next chapters of the movie. It was so good.Small things I disliked are: the accent. To me it sounded British. It reminded me of the''Narnia Chronicles'' movies that weren't that good. Personal opinion, not a terrible thing. And behavior of the owls. It seems so like a men behavior, even the way they talk. The main character is way to trusting and too kind. Of course it is done on purpose to depict difference, evil and good brother, but he is way too trusting and it seems a little too silly. I wish it was more of something else. The song by ''Owl City'', could be changed on something else, less known and much greater. By far so many know of ''Owl City'' and it could be changed on greater undiscovered or less known songs.And as I mentioned above, I LOOK FORWARD FOR THE NEXT MOVIES 8P",5,This is a must see!

I liked the use of 3D in this even better than the 3D in Avatar. It was that good.When I first saw it on the theater screen I was blown away, even from the first credits. This movie has a depth and ""realism"" that truly shows what 3D is capable of, without getting at all gimmicky.The story is a general coming of age story, of myths and legends and people who still believe. It's about family, and dreams, and all the things that touch us most. The design of the owls was outstanding, giving a natural expressiveness and uniqueness to each owl was a big feat considering how expressionless and similar looking owls actually are. But the subtleties in the expressions in this movie were simply amazing to see, and each owl had it's own distinct character, look, and voice.The backgrounds were beautifully rendered, but also very real looking. It was that golden mix of a fantasy world that looks real, without losing any of the power and message of the fantasy.This is a good vs evil story, and the scenery reflects that, from the comfortable, normal, forest home in the beginning, to the dark and sinister mines of the ""Pure Ones,"" to the busy and optimistic bustle of the great Tree of Ga'Hoole.Even the water scenes in this movie were outstanding, and water can be a nightmare to animate, much less when animating feathers, and wet feathers at that.I agree with the other reviewer who said they need an art book for this movie.

Golly, I could watch this every day and not get bored.There is a song in the middle of the film which serves as its theme that I don't like, but I just turn down the sound during that sequence.  Next minus: it's a pain to use this DVD.  You're stuck with a ton of previews you can't get out of (except to keep hitting the skip buttons), before you can even get to the DVD menu.

Third minus: the scene selections aren't titled.There are two special DVD features:  one, on the importance of owls in nature, very charming, roughly 15 minutes.

This has to be the best animation I have ever seen. Not only is almost every scene incredibly beautiful, but the characterization is amazing. With little more than eyes and a beak to work with the animators have created subtle expressions that give each owl a unique personality. On top of that there is a feather physics system that allows the animal's feathers to ruffle when they speak or move and even in response to the slightest breeze or movement. Incredible!The storyline here is a simple one, the battle between good and evil and the coming of age of a would be hero, Soren. You won't be dazzled by the simple plot which has been done many times, but you'll be so amazed by the images, flight scenes, mid-air battles and characterizations that you won't care. From the sweet humble Soren to the cold Queen Nyra (voice of Helen Mirren),the only low spot in the entire film is a very poorly suited vocal track inserted during a training session at the Tree of the Guardians. The silly pop song ""To the Sky"" ruined that whole segment for me and I literally had to mute the volume. Check out the soundtrack on Amazon and compare it (only song done by OWL CITY) to the rest of the soundtrack which was done by David Hirschfelder who also did some of the music for the movie ""Shine"" and appears to understand what a film score is supposed to accomplish.  I can only imagine that it was the work of someone's relative who needed a music credit. It flies in stark contrast to the song that follows which is associated with a zen-like flight scene. That song is ""The Host of Seraphim"" done by Dead Can Dance's, Lisa Gerrard. This is not on the soundtrack but it is available here.

It is directed by Zack Snyder, who also did Watchmen, Dawn of the Dead, and 300.  This is also a pretty violent film.  I am suprised it didn't get a PG-13 rating.  It doesn't contain any blood, just ruffled feathers.  Still it might give youngsters some nightmares.This owl flick is definitely a visual delight.  The CGI images are indeed crisp and amazing.  I watched it in 3D at the Imax theater, although I don't think the gimmicky glasses and resonant speaker system added anything to the movie.  They sure as heck didn't help cover the monotonous, derived storyline.It doesn't take long before you get the feeling of being kicked out of your nest before you are ready to fly.  Not that any aspect of the plot will go over your head, it is painstakingly simple and cliched.  The story flutters through a basic good owls vs. bad owls conflict.  There is no intelligent dialogue.  Not much humor.  No clever birds and the bees innuendo either.Final assessment--Booooring, bird-brained disaster--2.5 stars.

1393505,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B004AKCMD4,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 4]","""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"" is an animated film with the enchanting lure of a fairy tale, the intrigue of a medieval political thriller, the excitement of an action spectacle, and the majesty of a special effects extravaganza. What it lacks is the time needed to fully develop the characters and the story; the film, an amazing technical achievement, not only moves too quickly but also feels incredibly condensed, as if not just one, but several of Kathryn Lasky's ""Guardians of Ga'Hoole"" books (unread by me) were combined into a single story. With so many plot points reduced to vague descriptions, with so many characters that each have engaging and discernable personalities, I didn't feel like I was seeing a great movie, but rather the beginnings of a great movie. And that's the thing - the beginnings are there. For a film just ninety minutes long, that's quite an achievement.In what's essentially a redressing of a hero's journey, it tells the story of a barn owl named Soren (voiced by Jim Sturgess), who's brave, idealistic, a dreamer, and devoted to stories about the Guardian owls, legendary for their heroic acts and their protection of the kingdom of Ga'Hoole. His brother, Kludd (voiced by Ryan Kwanten), thinks the stories are merely that - stories - and is jealous of the attention Soren receives. One day, the brothers are abducted and taken to the lair of the evil Metalbeak (voiced by Joel Edgerton) and his wicked queen, Nyra (voiced by Helen Mirren). Once there, the weak owls are mentally incapacitated and forced to pick through owl pellets; the strong ones are brainwashed into joining Metalbeak's merciless army and take part in an insidious plot to take over the kingdom. The details of this takeover are left a little obscure, although it apparently involves a debilitating device that runs on scraps of metal.Brother is turned against brother as Soren befriends Gylfie, a timid elf owl (voiced by Emily Barclay), while Kludd is primed by Nyra to be the greatest of Metalbeak's soldiers. With a little help, Soren and Gylfie escape, and they realize with great excitement that they have finally learned how to fly. They quickly team up with a kooky burrowing owl named Digger (voiced by David Wenham) and his lute-playing poet companion, a great gray owl named Twilight (voiced by Anthony LaPaglia). Only then does Soren learn that the Guardians are not only real, but also the only hope left for saving ... I guess you'd have to call it owlkind, since mankind apparently doesn't exist in this world. Thus the story progresses to a fierce and fiery battle in Metalbeak's lair, which, if the title is of any indication, will someday become legend.This 3D animated fantasy, director Zach Snyder's first attempt at family entertainment, shows that considerable care went into creating its look. Production designer Simon Whiteley and art director Grant Freckelton have crafted a world of woodland charm and battle-scarred horror, with just a hint of Celtic thrown into the mix. The owls themselves are a triumph of animation, and I have no doubt that their feathers alone were a painstaking ordeal, what with the texture, color, movement, and transparency to take into consideration. There's a close-up shot late in the film, for example, of Soren as he flies through a violent rainstorm; coming towards the camera in slow motion, his feathers ruffle authentically in the howling winds, and rain droplets cling to his body while others splash into his eyes. It's a breathtaking moment, overflowing with power, grace, and style.The problem is that it didn't go far enough with the story. Either that, or far too much of it was trimmed away in post production. Whatever the case, ""Legend of the Guardians"" is one of the few films that actually needs an extra thirty minutes just for the sake of pacing and clarification. We're so quick to complain about a film that moves too slowly, but we often forget that it can be just as damaging for a film to move too fast - we don't want to leave the theater feeling as if crucial details have been overlooked. As a full two-hour film, I suspect the film would do more than seem complete; it would also be one of the best modern-day examples of a conventional fairy tale retold.Note: Despite the film's PG rating, ""Legend of the Guardians"" is considerably darker than most recent animated films - more so, I suspect, than the studios have been willing to reveal in the ads. There's no gratuitous violence, although there are a few decidedly violent moments of owls in battle. It's not excessively gloomy, although there is a consistent undercurrent of danger and despair. Take from this what you will. You obviously know your children a lot better than I do, but I've always been a firm believer that, in general, kids can tolerate a lot more unpleasantness than adults give them credit for. If this weren't the case, stories by J.K. Rowling, Roald Dahl, L. Frank Baum, The Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, or Carlo Collodi would not have withstood the test of time.",4,A Hero's Journey Takes Wing,1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,5062,"['Legend',

1393506,A2WQ6WSJIH1EME,B004AKCMD4,Christine Austen,"[2, 29]","This movie has racial undertones. The owls are being subjugated by a ""superior"" group of owls that capture them and make them pellet pushers. (owl pellets being moved around and collected)The superior owls are all bowing down to a large female owl who is delighted by the other owls vying for her attention after they compete in flying abilities. The chosen owls are trying to fight the owls who are new and not quite conforming to their new subjugation.The subjugated owls are put into a trance before going down into the lower area to collect and organize owl pellets. The three new owls try to escape being put into the trance. Two of the three new owls manage to not be put into a trance, they realize the third owl is under the trance and they essentially write him off as one of them at that point. The two new owls try to infiltrate the large female owl's status as a ruler and therefore dictator that is subjugating the other owls.I won't spoil the ending for you. The 3d effects are stunning, similar to Despicable Me or Coraline, however the lighting on this film is always darker than that of the other 3d movies mentioned. I thought this would be a nice movie to show off the new 3d television, however, I would have liked to have been warned that it is a downer, depressing, dark, not much like any kids movie I have ever endeavored to watch. I love kids movies, I just got Bolt 3d (Disney)and I even loved Cats and Dogs the Revenge of Kitty Galore, but a dark owl movie about owls being subjugated by other owls into a second class slave race of owl pellet pushers is not my idea of a good time kids movie.This movie would be a great metaphor for explaining the Holocaust to kids that were not quite ready for the real details of the real thing.",1,The Owl Holocaust,1300752000,"03 22, 2011",2011,1759,"['movie', 'racial', 'undertones', 'owls', 'are', 'being', 'subjugated', 'superior', 'group', 'owls', 'capture', 'make', 'pellet', 'pushers', 'owl', 'pellets', 'being', 'moved', 'collected', 'superior', 'owls', 'are', 'bowing', 'down', 'large', 'female', 'owl', 'who', 'delighted', 'other', 'owls', 'vying', 'attention', 'compete', 'flying', 'abilities', 'chosen', 'owls', 'are', 'trying', 'fight', 'owls', 'who', 'are', 'new', 'not', 'quite', 'conforming', 'new', 'subjugation.The', 'subjugated', 'owls', 'are', 'put', 'trance', 'going', 'down', 'lower', 'area', 'collect', 'organize', 'owl', 'pellets', 'three', 'new', 'owls', 'try', 'escape', 'being', 'put', 'trance', 'Two', 'three', 'new', 'owls', 'manage', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'trance', 'realize', 'third', 'owl', 'trance', 'essentially', 'write', 'off', 'one', 'point', 'two', 'new', 'owls', 'try', 'infiltrate', 'large', 'female', 'owl', 'status', 'ruler', 'therefore', 'dictator', 'subjugating', 'other', 'owls.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', '3d', 'effects', 'are', 'stunning', 'similar', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'Coraline', 'however', 'lighting', 'film', 'always', 'darker', 'other', '3d', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'movie', 'show', 'off', 'new', '3d', 'television', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'been', 'warned', 'downer', 'depressing', 'dark', 'not', 'much', 'kids', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'endeavored', 'watch', 'love', 'kids', 'movies', 'just', 'got', 'Bolt', '3d', 'Disney', 'even', 'loved', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'Revenge', 'Kitty', 'Galore', 'dark', 'owl', 'movie', 'owls', 'being', 'subjugated', 'other', 'owls', 'second', 'class', 'slave', 'race', 'owl', 'pellet', 'pushers', 'not', 'idea', 'good', 'time', 'kids', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'metaphor', 'explaining', 'Holocaust', 'kids', 'were', 'not', 'quite', 'ready', 'real', 'details', 'real', 'thing']",N/A

This movie is something I'd imagine for a long time and when I saw previews I immedietly beganing binge reading to complete the series in a little under two weeks.The movie was amazing! I went in 3-D and feel that it was well worth it. It was one of the fullest 3-D films I'd ever seen with things not only popping out but sinking away. The lanscapes were totally gorgeous and the owls simply marvelous. (Even if I think Twilight looks silly that is pretty much what a Great Gray Owl looks like.)POSSIBLE SPOILERSHow does the movie compare the books? Well, for one thing it covers 'three' books. Mostly book 1 and an adapted version of book 3. Book 2, The Journey, is covered very quickly.The villians of the novels were treated interestingly, combining groups of villians and splitting individual villians into two characters. However, this is handled so deftly as to be completely natural and it really works for this film.The settings. Nailed it. That's really all that needs to be said.The 'Band'. Awesome, I mentioned earlier Twilight looks silly, that is really the only thing working against the Band, you get a sense of the comraderie that builds in the books.Other Ga'Hoolian Owls. This is where the movie falls short. Otulissa has no real part in the movie, this is sad because she really does have a wonderful personality once it gets fully developed. Ezylryb, one of my favorites in the book, I don't know what happened here. It should work, I think once again he suffers from too little screen time. You never gets to see the quirks of his personality. While Barran and Boron were handled well this can't be said for many of the other Ga'Hoolians. Pity.Last but not least, the un-owly stuff. The owls are violent having large scale wars. Anyone who complains that the movie is violent probably would hate the books. The books have a heavy bit of fighting. Blacksmithing, who cares that owls can't really smith? It is important to realize that this is set in a post human world and owls can write too. While it is true that an owl isn't really built to forge steel one should never lose sight of the fact that this is fiction. Aand possibly my favorite part of the books, colliering. The idea of an owl flying through a forest fire is simply breathtaking and the movie delivered. Sequences where Soren was flying through fire were among some of the most beautiful I'd ever seen in a movie.",4,"Delightful, Gorgeous...

The opening sequence had my jaw dropping, this is super-realism at its finest.  I can't find fault with the lavish beauty which was stunning throughout.  An A+++++++ there.However.I can only be mesmerized by shiny objects for just so long before my mind starts to wander.  This wasn't just art on a wall, there was a story involved.  Well, to be honest, neither involving nor evolving.  It's obvious they spent all their money on the wow factor and two bits on the screenplay, if that.The F----- story (I'm being generous here), was a bare bones simplistic play of good against evil.  Like that's never been done before!  And better.  In this case, it's true that familiarity breeds contempt.  Every element has been culled by finer works, there was absolutely nothing fresh or new about the substance.  And this is probably why it was a dismal failure domestically (yet a hit on the international stage - go figure).An exercise in futility?  Maybe.  But I still ended up with a begrudging fondness for the stupid thing.  I'd call it grim but exquisite.Do I recommend it?  I'd say that would depend entirely on your expectations.

1393533,A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B004AKCMD4,Feelah the tigress,"[0, 0]","When I picked this up I was expecting a run-of-the-mill children's animated film, complete with songs, cheesy jokes, and the usual.  From the second I started watching, though, I knew I was in for a completely different experience.  By the end of the film, I was completely blown away.  I mean, I was expecting something on the level of ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" but instead I got the animated version of Lord of the Rings - you know, if Gandalf and company were CGI owls.Speaking of the plot, this is the quintessential ""hero's tale"" that's been told and re-told about a million times.  That being said, if a film isn't compelling enough then this sort of story can end up feeling stale and re-hashed.  So, does ""Legend of the Guardians"" succeed or fail?  Well, I feel like it's a success.  I never felt bored the whole time I was watching.  Even though a lot of familiar elements and themes are present (hero's journey, family members betraying each other, evil overlords, etc.), there were also a lot of times where I thought to myself ""Oh, I bet that this will happen"", but it never did!  They managed to avoid enough of the cliches to keep the film from feeling too predictable.  My only complaints about the actual story are the fact that some things remain unexplained, and the film engaging in obvious sequel-baiting (something I'm not fond of since they can't really guarantee that sequel will ever come).  Overall, though, I'm pretty pleased.So, I've already established that I enjoyed the film greatly - but I'm an adult.  Even though ""Legend of the Guardians"" is marketed as a children's film, parents might want to exercise caution in allowing their children to see this.  It's fairly violent (but not gory), and even though they try to throw in some brief comic relief, it has an overall atmosphere of seriousness and dread.  I couldn't really give you a definitive age range, but parents should know whether or not their children are too sensitive for a film like this.Lastly, I need to mention why I've only given this film four stars instead of five.  It has nothing to do with the movie itself and more to do with the set-up of the DVD.  There are several annoying features that really irked me.  First off, when you first turn on the DVD player, if you don't hit the menu button immediately various trailers will start playing.  You CANNOT skip these!  If you try to hit the menu button during a trailer, it won't do anything.  You also cannot use the ""skip to next scene"" button.  So, you've either got to turn off the player and try again or wait through all the trailers (and there are a lot).  That's just cruel and inexcusable.  My second complaint has to do with the DVD options.  The only two options you get are ""play movie"" and ""Language"".  They didn't even have the courtesy to give us a scene select option.  Nor are there any special features of any kind.  I know some people don't care about special features, but I like watching the ""making-of"" documentaries and personal interviews with the cast and crew.  It would've been nice to see that here.  Well, anyway, those are my only real complaints.Despite the minor irritations with the DVD itself, I still recommend this film.  Among hideously vapid movies like ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"", ""Legend of the Guardians"" stands out as a quality film that should not be missed.  Even if you're not entirely sure, just rent it first and give it a try.

1393536,A3OZ7RXT1XGZR9,B004AKCMD4,freeismylife,"[3, 3]","This movie is about a young owl named Soren (voiced by Jim Sturgess) who is in awe of a story told to him by his father of a group of solider owls called ""The Guardians"" who fought and won a war many years ago that brought peace to the owl nations.  It is said that ""The Guardians"" live in a magical tree on the other side of the sea and they appear when owls are in trouble.One day Soren is pushed out of the nest by his evil brother and they are both captured by the spinster owls of St. Aggie's.  Soren's brother joins the owls in their plot to take over the owl nations, but Soren refuses and is put to work gathering metal pellets to make a strange machine that the owls of St. Aggie's plan to use to kill ""The Guardians"".  Soren makes friends with another owl named Gylfie (voiced by Emily Barclay) and they both escape and set off on a quest to find ""The Guardians"".  The rest of the story is about their adventures along the way and their battle to bring peace to the owl nations.This movie is stunningly beautiful to watch.  The 3D effects and the animation make for a visually stimulating experience.  The story is also inspiring.  Soren's belief in a legend about the power of good over evil gives him the courage to fight against seemingly insurmountable odds in his attempt to save all the kidnapped young owls.  There are times when the movie is a little dry, but the excitement at the end totally makes up for any slow scenes.One word of caution on taking young children to see this movie. Even though this is a cartoon, the movie deals with themes that include the cruelty of war, prisoners of war and the kidnapping of young children. The most exciting scenes in the movie are the battles, which are graphic in parts so this movie is really not appropriate for children who get scared when confronted with these themes. My ten year old son is the perfect age for this movie. He loved every minute, especially the brutal fight scenes. We will definitely see more about these owls since the end of the movie was setup perfectly for a sequel.""Legends of the Guardians - The Owls of Ga'hoole"" is a beautiful, enjoyable and exciting movie that is just made for 3D.

She finished this series in 2008. So don't be surprised if in the next year or so a sequel to this movie shows up. Ms Lasky has written about 100 books for children and young adults (fiction and non-fiction). However, make no mistake, this is not just a kiddie film, in fact it has been given a PG rating.Storyline:When two young owls fall from the safety of their tree they are kidnapped and forced to join the evil Pure Ones that have their base at St. Aggie's. Soren (Jim Sturgess) and his new found friends then journey to seek out the legendary Guardians (Jedi ??) to stop the evil plans of the Pure Ones.The plot is not overly original, defeat the evil empire, and may the force be with you. The evil leader wears a black iron mask (although there is no deep breathing noise) reminds of an owlish version of Darth Vader.Cinematics:The graphics are simply awesome, there are a lot of sunsets, seaside scenes and massive trees that are wonderous to behold. The owls are also beautiful to look at the feathers move individually with the wind and the mechanics of flight are accurately portrayed. The slo-mo effects are wonderfully done, the final battle is quite dramatic.Conclusion:This film is among the best animated full length movies for 2010. It is very strong on its technical aspects.

I don't know if this was the author's intent, but it was pretty hard to miss.The story is about some Hitler-type owls wanting to rule over all the other owls due to their supposed species superiority. They call themselves the ""Pure Ones"", hinting again at their claim to genetic right. Although the name itself smacks of religiosity, and had me wondering if it was supposed to be a hit on the Inquisition, etc., the script made it clear that the underlying idea was Darwinism's ugly stepchild - the idea that the superior race should rule by right. Although there has been a concerted attempt (and a flurry of popular books) to hide this unintended legacy, it is the logical implication that Hitler understood. In fact, Hitler justified his course using the language of Darwinism. (Although Darwin himself abhorred slavery, his theory was in fact used to further the mentality behind slavery - for example, the horror of aborigines hunted down in Australia to serve as museum displays of ""lower races."" Darwinism was also the inspiration for Planned Parenthood - most people are still unaware that Margaret Sanger started it to reduce the numbers of black, Asian, poor, uneducated, and other ""undesirable"" populations.)Although rarely discussed, this implication of Darwinism still stands mutely in the corner ... hoping to be ignored in public discourse, but waiting one day to be reawakened.(Richard Dawkins himself admitted he would not want to live in a Darwinistic society. Why? ""Because it would be fascism."")There was also a message about faith and belief in what you have not yet seen, and the importance of intangibles such as love and courage. Since these are understood by Darwinists as mere chemical illusions conserved for survival value (just as some evolutionists have argued that gossip, rape, adultery and murder also have evolutionary ""value""), I would take this as another indication that this movie is on the other side of Darwinism.Regarding the prophet echidna, it's hard to say without having read the book. At first he looks like a scam artist inserted for comedic effect or even to warn against religious hucksters. However, later he seems like the real thing.Artistically, the movie cannot be much faulted. Almost every frame looks like a beautiful painting. However, in many scenes this quality of detail makes it hard to see what's happening or what's important. Since every feather and background element is rendered in detail, sometimes it's hard to see the owl for the feathers. More care should have been taken to balance the visuals. The battle action is fast and furious and - perhaps intentionally - unintelligible.For its warning against the unstated dangers of Darwinism, it's worth a watch, although its ending seemed too deus ex machina with a convenient forest fire handy.",3,Will make Darwinists uncomfortable,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,2980,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'impression', 'movie', 'here', 'Darwinists', 'should', 'squirm', 'seats', 'kids', 'are', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'author', 'intent', 'was', 'pretty', 'hard', 'miss.The', 'story', 'Hitler-type', 'owls', 'wanting', 'rule', 'other', 'owls', 'due', 'supposed', 'species', 'superiority', 'call', 'Pure', 'Ones', 'hinting', 'again', 'claim', 'genetic', 'right', 'name', 'smacks', 'religiosity', 'had', 'wondering', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'hit', 'Inquisition', 'etc.', 'script', 'made', 'clear', 'underlying', 'idea', 'was', 'Darwinism', 'ugly', 'stepchild', 'idea', 'superior', 'race', 'should', 'rule', 'right', 'been', 'concerted', 'attempt', 'flurry', 'popular', 'books', 'hide', 'unintended', 'legacy', 'logical', 'implication', 'Hitler', 'understood', 'fact', 'Hitler', 'justified', 'course', 'using', 'language', 'Darwinism', 'Darwin', 'abhorred', 'slavery', 'theory', 'was', 'fact', 'used', 'further', 'mentality', 'slavery', 'example', 'horror', 'aborigines', 'hunted', 'down', 'Australia', 'serve', 'museum', 'displays', 'lower', 'races', 'Darwinism', 'was', 'also', 'inspiration', 'Planned', 'Parenthood', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'unaware', 'Margaret', 'Sanger', 'started', 'reduce', 'numbers', 'black', 'Asian', 'poor', 'uneducated', 'other', 'undesirable', 'populations', 'rarely', 'discussed', 'implication', 'Darwinism', 'still', 'mutely', 'corner', 'hoping', 'be', 'ignored', 'public', 'discourse', 'waiting', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'reawakened', 'Richard', 'admitted', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'live', 'Darwinistic', 'society', 'Why', 'would', 'be', 'fascism', 'was', 'also', 'message', 'faith', 'belief', 'what', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'importance', 'intangibles', 'such', 'love', 'courage', 'are', 'understood', 'Darwinists', 'mere', 'chemical', 'illusions', 'conserved', 'survival', 'value', 'just', 'evolutionists', 'have', 'argued', 'gossip', 'rape', 'adultery', 'murder', 'also', 'have', 'evolutionary', 'value', 'would', 'take', 'indication', 'movie', 'other', 'side', 'Darwinism.Regarding', 'prophet', 'echidna', 'hard', 'say', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'scam', 'artist', 'inserted', 'comedic', 'effect', 'even', 'warn', 'religious', 'hucksters', 'However', 'later', 'real', 'thing.Artistically', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'much', 'faulted', 'frame', 'beautiful', 'painting', 'However', 'many', 'scenes', 'quality', 'detail', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'what', 'important', 'feather', 'background', 'element', 'rendered', 'detail', 'hard', 'see', 'owl', 'feathers', 'More', 'care', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'balance', 'visuals', 'battle', 'action', 'fast', 'furious', 'perhaps', 'intentionally', 'unintelligible.For', 'warning', 'unstated', 'dangers', 'Darwinism', 'watch', 'ending', 'seemed', 'too', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'convenient', 'forest', 'fire', 'handy']",N/A

1393547,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004AKCMD4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS: THE OWLS OF GA'HOOLE flaunts an ungainly title and a cumbersome unfolding of  narrative. But, geez, it's so pretty to look at. The visuals are absolutely stunning, and it's a shame that the filmmakers couldn't invest as much in its ho-hum storytelling. It strives for an epic feel, but I think falls just short of grandeur. It features the coming-of-age tale of the owlet Soren. Soren has long been entranced by his father's tales of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole, them legendary owl warriors who once waged a great war against the despicable Pure Ones.So far Soren has led a dull, sheltered life. He can't even fly all that well as yet. But one bout of oneupmanship too many with his more skilled brother, Kludd, results in their plummeting from their treetop home and onto the woodsy bottom. And owls have no place being on the ground, where they're rendered exceedingly vulnerable. Soren and Kludd are owlnapped and taken to the stronghold of the Pure Ones, them renegade owls still bent on enslaving the rest of their brethern. Their preferred method is to expose their victims to the moon's influence, ""moon-blinking"" they calls it, the moon in essence stupefying the unwary and transforming them into zombie work drones.But I'm going on and on about a pretty generic plot. Suffice it to say, brother Kludd opts to stay with the Pure Ones, is enlisted in their savage troops. Soren escapes and embarks on a quest to locate the Owls of Ga'Hoole, to warn them about the Pure Ones. Along the way, Soren meets several companions, establishes a fellowship (this is mandatory in heroic quests). Thank goodness for the burly Twilight and Soren's snake nursemaid, Mrs. P. They provide most of what humor there is. This epic is so determinedly earnest and somber that even J.R.R. Tolkien thinks it needs to lighten up. Tack on characters with no grace notes and unfolding events that failed to draw me in and, really, the breathtaking animation is the sole reason to recommend this film. This is a visual spectacle in which to bask your eyeballs. Else, take the plot and the characters and the tired dialogue, and insert a live action format, and I think what you have is something the Sci-Fi Channel would be proud to call its own.Parents, be warned that while there is no blood or gore, the film doesn't shy from rolling out scenes of fierce owl-on-owl violence. In this narrative, death is very much part of the order of things. Only, it's a higher evolved circle of life, what with various birds clad in armor and tearing adversaries with vicious metal talons. There are some very dynamic action sequences, not the least of which is Soren's harrowing showdown with Metal Beak, the malevolent chieftain of the Pure Ones. I wished I cared more about who won this death match. I guess I'm edging towards Soren, even though he makes Frodo Baggins seem breezy. But I harbor mad respect for Metal Beak whose creepy metal accoutrements make him look downright scary. You gaze at Metal Beak and you don't doubt he's capable of serious, er, foul play. Except that in a children's story, villains aren't allowed to win, so suck on that, Metal Beak. 3 or 3.5 stars out of 5 for this one, with its animated virtuosity and disappointing storytelling.",4,"""Remember, when your wings are weak, your spirits done, and you've flown as far as you can - you're halfway there.""",1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,3258,"['LEGEND', 'THE', 'GUARDIANS', 'OWLS', 'OF', ""GA'HOOLE"", 'ungainly', 'title', 'cumbersome', 'unfolding', 'narrative', 'geez', 'so', 'pretty', 'look', 'visuals', 'are', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'shame', 'filmmakers', 'could', ""n't"", 'invest', 'as', 'much', 'ho-hum', 'storytelling', 'epic', 'feel', 'think', 'falls', 'just', 'short', 'grandeur', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'owlet', 'Soren', 'Soren', 'long', 'been', 'entranced', 'father', 'tales', 'Guardians', ""Ga'Hoole"", 'legendary', 'owl', 'warriors', 'who', 'once', 'waged', 'great', 'war', 'despicable', 'Pure', 'Ones.So', 'far', 'Soren', 'led', 'dull', 'sheltered', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'fly', 'well', 'yet', 'one', 'bout', 'oneupmanship', 'too', 'many', 'more', 'skilled', 'brother', 'Kludd', 'results', 'plummeting', 'treetop', 'home', 'woodsy', 'bottom', 'have', 'place', 'being', 'ground', 'where', ""'re"", 'rendered', 'exceedingly', 'vulnerable', 'Soren', 'Kludd', 'are', 'owlnapped', 'taken', 'stronghold', 'Pure', 'Ones', 'renegade', 'owls', 'still', 'bent', 'enslaving', 'rest', 'brethern', 'preferred', 'method', 'expose', 'victims', 'moon', 'influence', 'moon-blinking', 'moon', 'essence', 'stupefying', 'unwary', 'transforming', 'zombie', 'work', 'drones.But', ""'m"", 'going', 'pretty', 'generic', 'plot', 'Suffice', 'say', 'brother', 'Kludd', 'opts', 'stay', 'Pure', 'Ones', 'enlisted', 'savage', 'troops', 'Soren', 'quest', 'locate', 'Owls', ""Ga'Hoole"", 'warn', 'Pure', 'Ones', 'way', 'Soren', 'several', 'companions', 'fellowship', 'mandatory', 'heroic', 'quests', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'burly', 'Twilight', 'Soren', 'snake', 'nursemaid', 'Mrs.', 'P.', 'provide', 'most', 'what', 'humor', 'epic', 'so', 'determinedly', 'earnest', 'somber', 'even', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'lighten', 'up', 'Tack', 'characters', 'grace', 'notes', 'unfolding', 'events', 'failed', 'draw', 'really', 'breathtaking', 'animation', 'sole', 'reason', 'recommend', 'film', 'visual', 'spectacle', 'bask', 'eyeballs', 'Else', 'take', 'plot', 'characters', 'tired', 'dialogue', 'insert', 'live', 'action', 'format', 'think', 'what', 'have', 'something', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'call', 'own.Parents', 'be', 'warned', 'blood', 'gore', 'film', ""n't"", 'shy', 'rolling', 'out', 'scenes', 'fierce', 'owl-on-owl', 'violence', 'narrative', 'death', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'order', 'things', 'Only', 'higher', 'evolved', 'circle', 'life', 'what', 'various', 'birds', 'clad', 'armor', 'tearing', 'adversaries', 'vicious', 'metal', 'talons', 'are', 'very', 'dynamic', 'action', 'sequences', 'not', 'least', 'Soren', 'harrowing', 'showdown', 'Metal', 'Beak', 'malevolent', 'chieftain', 'Pure', 'Ones', 'wished', 'cared', 'more', 'who', 'won', 'death', 'match', 'guess', ""'m"", 'edging', 'towards', 'Soren', 'even', 'Frodo', 'Baggins', 'seem', 'breezy', 'harbor', 'mad', 'respect', 'Metal', 'Beak', 'creepy', 'metal', 'accoutrements', 'make', 'look', 'downright', 'scary', 'gaze', 'Metal', 'Beak', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'capable', 'serious', 'er', 'foul', 'play', 'children', 'story', 'villains', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'win', 'so', 'suck', 'Metal', 'Beak', '3', '3.5', 'stars', '5', 'one', 'animated', 'virtuosity', 'disappointing', 'storytelling']",N/A

1393552,A96AUNSF6GESO,B004AKCMD4,Janeite,"[4, 4]","The short version of my review is this: the animation is spectacular and makes up for most of the weaknesses in the film. Now for details. Those who have stated in their reviews that this is the most visually beautiful film they have ever seen are NOT exaggerating. As my family watched this dvd in our living room (on our 1080p plasma) my husband kept saying, ""We should have gone to the theater to see this in 3D."" It truly looks amazing. I can't speak to the blu-ray since we only have seen the dvd, but I imagine it would bring even more of the incredible detail to life. No one in our family had ever read or heard of the books this film is based on, so the story was unfamiliar to us, though it is a familiar enough story. Young owls are kidnaped from their peaceful forest home and enslaved in an evil kingdom. They escape, find the mythical Guardians, and become involved in an epic battle of good vs. evil in which they much face their fears, draw on strength they didn't know they had, etc. There are so many elements of the story that are familiar (basic hero's quest stuff) that even my kids kept saying things like, ""This is just like Lord of the Rings"" or ""That's like when Obi Wan dies"" or even ""This reminds me of Harry Potter."" The dialogue was difficult for us to make out (we kept having to turn up the volume), but I'm not sure if that is a fault with the sound or something to do with the Australian accents. The overall tone of the film is rather dark and dramatic, and the interjection of a perky Owl City song in the middle was somewhat jarring. My 13 year old son said, ""That's cute to have an Owl City song while we're literally looking at an Owl City, but the song is too cheerful."" The names of the characters were hard to understand, and we couldn't even read some of them when the credits rolled.

The movie is amazing to watch. The computer animation is so real, beautiful and at times disturbing. This movie is not just for kids. But, the battle scenes aren't for the young kids. My 11 and 12 year olds watch this. I wouldn't recommend going too much younger unless they're really desensitized to violence already, which isn't recommended because we should protect the minds of the very young so that they're not exposed to ideas that they're not ready to handle. While there was no blood or gore, there are slashing enemies throats, birds falling hard on the ground, one bird falls in the fire and stuff like that. It's done tastefully, but just be warned.

I watched it over and over.

1393565,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B004AKCMD4,Kathy W,"[2, 4]","This good vs. evil treat to the eyes, begins with an owl family nested in the hollow of a large old tree. (I believe they were white snowy owls if I have my breeds correct.) Two younger male owls (brothers) and their baby sister are looked after by parents and a snake nanny named Mrs. P.  The young males are learning to fly and are also told the battle stories of the great Guardians (the great owls) who keep peace and protect the masses.  One of the young males is mesmerized by the tales, so much so that they are told to go to bed before they are up all night with ""Daymares"" :-).When they are supposed to be asleep, the brothers sneak out to practice flying and wind up on the ground, a no-no for an owl.  Approached by danger, they are grabbed in the nick of time by other owls, who carry them off into the night, only to become enslaved to serve an elite group of owls called ""The Pure Ones"" and their evil leader ""Metal Beak"" and his beautiful but nasty queen.Of course, the Pure Ones are anything but pure-in-heart.  They kidnap young owls to serve their power kick to take over the owl world.  The ""lucky"" ones get to fight for the cause.  The unlucky ones get to pick up mouse pellets (the fur balls owls cough up after they eat a mouse - yuk) and throw them into some sort of energy recycling machine that zaps other owls.  The unlucky ones got ""moonblinked"" --kind of mind-zapped into servant zombies.In a quest to save the goodness in the owl world from the evil-doers, our hero sets out to find the Guardians at the Great Tree and release the enslaved.I found the CGI stunning and the imbedded messages to be that you can achieve your widest dreams in this approximate 90 minute film.  It was pretty adventure filled.  We also had the strong message of good fighting evil, of strong friendships and caring for each other along with love of family.  It was also a ""tap into the strength within"" film. I loved it.As a side note, there is some violence that may frighten the very young children.  If your children are young and sensitive, you may want to see it first yourself.

Further, it is the story of his escape and his meeting with the legendary ""Guardians,"" who are pledged to fight evil.  The climax of the story comes with the ending battle between the forces of light and dark, and the the film tells of the young owl's adventures in finding his way between good and evil.  The story tells of his search for adulthood in the process.This story does an excellent job of using the ideas and themes of Joseph Campbell in a way that is instructive and fun. The characterization is solid. The graphics are marvelous. There is humor and tenderness along the way.While this is a good family story, do not show this to very young children.

My son's friend, also nine, hasn't read the books, but likes action - adventure. Both boys loved the movie.

His friend thought the story was very exciting and is talking now about reading the books. Both of them loved the animation, which is absolutely gorgeous. The rendering of the Great Ga'Hoole Tree, the home of the Guardians, was beautifully detailed and very much as my son had imagined the tree.Briefly, without spoiling the plot, Soren, a young barn owl finds himself in the clutches of a group of owls who are planning to defeat the forces of good in the owl kingdom and enslave everyone else. Soren and his friend Gylfie escape and seek help stopping the evil owls. The movie addresses issues of what is real, what is right, and who is family.There is significant owl-to-owl violence, but the gore is kept to a minimum, and the difficult themes are much softened from the way they are portrayed in the books. If you are a fan of the books, I think you will enjoy this adaptation, which is both very faithful to the spirit of the books and fresh enough not to be merely a visual recap of the stories you have already read.

I'm not usually a fan of the movies that he directs, but with this one his style really shines through on!Picture Quality: This movie is simply stunning to watch. Between my roommate and myself we have around 40 3D movies and this is easily one of the most impressive looking. I'm far more critical than your average viewer when it comes to cross talk. I hate it. Most movies nail the foreground, but the background is where you'll see most ghosting. With Legends it was only a problem a few times, and was so forgivable that you quickly forgot that it ever happened. This isn't how I feel about most movies when I watch them. In most scenes your eyes can focus on whatever you want and naturally adjust to the depth as though it was right in front of you. The best part, it's not so overwhelming to your senses that you feel a headache coming on! In my opinion, this movie is up there with Avatar, How to Train Your Dragon, The Hobbit (both of them), Pacific Rim (Very impressive post production 3D), Turbo, etc. when it comes to the quality of the 3D, and overall visual experience.Audio (my setup is 5.1 surround): I'll take care of this aspect after viewing the movie again. I belatedly realized that my subwoofer had been off while I watched it.Plot: It felt rushed. However, In all honesty I think the movie would have done horribly if it was much longer or Snyder had chosen to Peter Jackson it and cover every last detail. Yet, there were definitely a few plot points that seemed to happen far too suddenly and could have used a bit more fleshing out. This is probably due to the movie seeming like it takes place over a 3-4 day span of time while in the books it was probably (haven't read them) longer. It just feels like a lot happens too quickly, which is also a strength of this movie. You never really feel like it gets too bogged down. The story moves rapidly and definitely keeps viewers engaged.All in all, both my girlfriend and myself walked away from the movie feeling like we'd be more than happy to watch it again. This is the biggest selling point for me. I love the 3D, but the fact that it had an appealing storyline along with the beautiful visuals makes me very happy that I purchased this movie. If you have a 3D television and want to get the most out of it then this is a must buy.",5,Very surprised by this movie!

1393591,A8ZY9LI1KBU2P,B004AKCMD4,Mary Kate,"[155, 174]","Based on Kathryn Lasky's children's series (Guardians of Ga'hoole Complete Set, Books 1-15), The Legend of the Guardians: the Owls of Ga'hoole is an epic story of good and evil, bravery, betrayal and of doing what's right.Briefly, the story centers around Soren, a young barn owl living in the forest of Tyto, who is enraptured with the tales his father tells of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole, the great warriors and protectors of the owl world who have passed into legend. When Soren and his brother Kludd are kidnapped and taken to a deep canyon where young owls are being ""moon-blinked"" into mindless slavery by the evil ""Pure Ones"", Soren escapes with another young owl and sets out to find the Guardians and plead for their help. Once they find the Guardians, a rescue is planned and the film climaxes with a soaring aerial battle between the Guardians and the Pure Ones.The plot is not new. Fans of Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, among others, will recognize many of the story elements and several of the characters common to films and books based on the classic ""Hero's Journey"". So, the question becomes - have the filmmakers made this hero's journey one worth seeing? For me, the answer is ""Yes"". And that ""yes"" comes, in no small part, from how the film looks.Legend of the Guardians is so completely spectacular to look at that I found myself able to ignore some of the issues with the plotting and the script and just sit back and drown in the visual feast. The ""scenery"" throughout the entire film - so jaw-droppingly gorgeous in theaters - translates very well to the home screen and the animation looks superb on Blu-ray. The flying sequences are not quite as breathtaking here as they were on the big screen, but all-in-all I think the film has made a successful transition to home viewing. Certainly it remains incredibly beautiful and exciting to look at. I wish all animated films offered the same visual pleasure.Parents should be aware, though, that ""animated"" in this case does not translate into ""kiddie-show"". While there are moments of warmth and companionship and a few humorous bits, the film has a number of violent scenes and an overall intensity that might frighten or lessen the enjoyment of the under 8 crowd. I will volunteer, though, that my just under 8 year old granddaughter LOVED this film and didn't seem to find it too intense at all. So my age guesstimate might be a bit off. Since parents always know their own children and what they can handle far better than any reviewers do anyway, I offer the ""8 and over"" as a sort of jumping off point. :) I'll add, too, that the level of intensity I felt the film possessed on the big screen seemed somewhat lessened when I viewed the film at home.A few additional notes on the film:* There are a lot of characters with unusual names. Unless viewers (kids OR adults) have read the books, they're probably not going to catch or remember them all in a first viewing.* There are a few instances where the dialogue is difficult to understand.* The score suits the film. In parts it incorporates the human voice, as Lord of the Rings did, to effectively evoke an emotional response in the viewer. On the other hand, the song ""To the Sky"" (credited to ""Owl City"" on the soundtrack CD) was, IMO, the film's most glaring misstep. The chipper tune felt so out of place it actually made me cringe.Some notes on the DVD (I bought the Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy version):I'll admit straight off that I am not a techy person, so my comments on the quality of the video can be taken with that in mind. That said, the Blu-ray picture clarity is wonderful, the colors vivid and the sound good. For me, all are completely satisfactory. Navigation is pretty straight-forward and didn't trip me up too often - something I'm thankful for and something I, unfortunately, can't say about all DVDs.The film can be viewed in English, French, Spanish or Portuguese. Subtitles in those same languages are also offered.Special features include:* ""True Guardians of the Earth"": The animated character Digger & Rico Rodriguez (Modern Family) host a documentary about owls which presents interesting information in a kid-friendly style.* Maximum ""Kid"" Mode - Explore the World of Ga'hoole"": Soren and other cast members act as guides for this picture-in-picture style viewing of the film. Information is offered on animation and various aspects of filmmaking and storytelling. Well done. Should be particularly interesting to young people interested in behind the scenes stuff and the nuts and bolts of filmmaking. Also included is additional scientific information about owls, their anatomy and their habits.* Legend of the Guardians: Armor up with Soren & Eglantine: Kids can mix and match different types of owl armor.* Match the Owl Treats: A matching game.* ""Legend of the Guardians: Rise of the Guardians"": A short film about the Pure Ones and the legendary Battle of the Ice Claws between Metalbeek and Lyze of Kiel.* Looney Tunes ""Fur of Flying"": The Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote cartoon featured in theaters along with LOTG. (On the 3D version of this DVD, this cartoon is also in 3D.)* Artwork Galleries: stills of some of the lovely artwork from the film.* ""To the Sky"" music video by Owl City.For my granddaughter and me, this film was a winner and now that it's part of my home collection, I'm looking forward to sharing it with my other grandchildren over the next few years as they grow old enough to appreciate it. While the plot may be rather familiar, IMO it avoided coming across as tired or trite. That, along with the stunning look of the film, makes it easy for me to recommend it. And I do, happily.Enjoy!",4,Gorgeous Visual Feast,1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,5679,"['Based', 'Kathryn', 'Lasky', 'children', 'series', 'Guardians', ""Ga'hoole"", 'Complete', 'Set', 'Books', '1-15',

The movie seems too focused on moving the plot along as fast as it can when I feel their where some moments it should have slowed down and let the characters ""breathe"" a little.I would say this film is worthy of a weekend rental, and if your a 3D buff,worth keeping around in your collection.Another plus to the 3D version of this film is a Looney Tune short which features wile e coyote and the Road Runner.

I was not sure if I would enjoy this movie as it was publicised as having been created by the makers of Happy Feet, a film that although beautiful, failed to impress at the storytelling level. The Legend of the Guardians therefore came as a fine surprise indeed. The story was cohesive, well paced, with characters that were distinct and likable. Coming from a 3D animation and visual effects background, I would be the first to nitpick but I really couldn't bring myself to, as I enjoyed it that much.Shortly after viewing the film I purchased the first few books of the series and am now at book 6. I must say that despite SO much of the content having been removed or rewritten, the movie did the best that it could imaginably do in a short time frame. Yes, there is alot of wonderful content missing, but as a lover of the written word I'm happy to go to the books if I want to enjoy all of that. And I certainly encourage those who have enjoyed the movie to do the same! Rather than feeling you know everything that is about to happen because you have seen the film, the books will have plenty of surprises for you since they are so very different.",5,"beautiful rendition, but VERY different from the books",1294963200,"01 14, 2011",2011,1499,"['had', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'time', 'came', 'movie', 'knowledge', 'characters', 'plot', 'had', 'been', 'covered', 'author', 'result', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'own', 'merits', 'aside', 'vocal', 'pop/rock', 'song', 'played', 'one', 'point', 'very', 'briefly', 'very', 'place', 'such', 'beautiful', 'well', 'crafted', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'was', 'publicised', 'having', 'been', 'created', 'makers', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'film', 'beautiful', 'failed', 'impress', 'storytelling', 'level', 'Legend', 'Guardians', 'therefore', 'came', 'fine', 'surprise', 'indeed', 'story', 'was', 'cohesive', 'well', 'paced', 'characters', 'were', 'distinct', 'likable', 'Coming', '3D', 'animation', 'visual', 'effects', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'nitpick', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'enjoyed', 'much.Shortly', 'viewing', 'film', 'purchased', 'first', 'few', 'books', 'series', 'am', 'now', 'book', '6', 'must', 'say', 'SO', 'much', 'content', 'having', 'been', 'removed', 'rewritten', 'movie', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'imaginably', 'do', 'short', 'time', 'frame', 'Yes', 'alot', 'wonderful', 'content', 'missing', 'lover', 'written', 'word', ""'m"", 'happy', 'go', 'books', 'want', 'enjoy', 'certainly', 'encourage', 'who', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'do', 'same', 'Rather', 'feeling', 'know', 'everything', 'happen', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'books', 'will', 'have', 'plenty', 'surprises', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'different']",N/A
1393620,AHF97M45JFCB,B004AKCMD4,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","The Legend of the Guardians is a strange tale- and I'm not even talking about the actual film.  Hyped during its theatrical run (which began on September 24th of 2010), Warner Brother announced that it was scheduled for a mid-February DVD/ Blu-ray release.  Then suddenly (presumably in effort to capitalize on the spend-happy Holiday shopper scene), the DVD & Blu-ray were released and with virtually no hoopla on December 17th.  I nearly completely overlooked it as a result except for the fact that when preordering Despicable Me, I was recommended Guardians with the sub text ""available now"".Going into the film, I was aware of the fact that the material would be joining an ever-growing list (a list that includes Shrek, Meet the Robinsons, How to Train your Dragon, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs to mention a few) of animated features based on popular children's book series.  This one was done up by the studio responsible for Happy Feet (Village Roadshow), distributed by powerhouse Warner Brothers and represents Zack Snyder's (the man responsible for such works as Watchmen and 300) directorial debut in animated feature film.On the whole, Warner Brothers has been lagging behind in the highly lucrative animated feature market; a place dominated by Disney/ Pixar and DreamWorks.  Other studios in similar positions have begun to realize the potential in this segment and are putting in serious work to catch up (Sony with ImageWorks, 20th Century Fox with Blue Sky and so on).  WB hasn't proven quite as eager as the competition so converting Kathryn Lasky's series of young reader fantasy books into CG is about as good a place to start making up for lost time.Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole' uses personified owls to weave its tale in a completely fantastical world (seemingly devoid of humans).  The plot works on the fantasy template on nearly a point-by-point basis:  A young, inexperienced (eventual) hero is introduced from the safety of his picturesque home.  Innocence and security are whisked away by invasion of a powerful enemy army, complete with a weapon of incalculable advantage.  The only force in the world capable of keeping the rising threat at bay have long since retired to the recesses of memory and myth.The quest begins to not only prove the legend true, but to convince the Guardians to come out of their self-imposed retirement to once again rise up against this evil empire (The Pure Ones) to restore peace and harmony to the whole land.  Along the way there will be requisite betrayals, family division, advice from goodhearted heroes, training from hardened warriors, a better understanding of the horrors of war and why freedom is worth fighting to preserve.If this all sounds familiar, that's because it's a story archetype that's been told countless times throughout the ages.  Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Eragon; you can find this precise tale in various forms of entertainment spanning literature, film, poetry, folklore and so on.  However, don't be mistaken into believing that because its formulaic, Legend of the Guardians comes up short.  But we'll get to that.Notice the apparent lack of names included in my above story summary?  That was a deliberate homage to the actual experience in that upon the film's conclusion, I was confident only in the names of two of the fifteen main characters.Names like Otulissa, Strix Struma, Ezylryb, Eglantine and Allomere were made clear to me only in post-viewing research and even then I was quite unsure which were which. Australian accents and little scripting effort to embed faces with the names results is a definite ""so that's the main guy's brother there?"" experience.  Fortunately, somehow, the film suffers none as a result of this little snafu.  A marketing disaster, sure, but the entertainment value endures.And speaking of entertainment value, Legend of the Guardians is a visual feast! It can truly be said that Pixar and DreamWorks have absolutely nothing on Village Roadshow.  Lighting is spectacular, settings are rich with background detail and the character models are so well textured/ animated that they often border on photorealism.  The flight sequences, particularly when viewed in high-definition, are breathtaking.  I can only imagine what the experience must have been like in a 3D theater.There are a few complaints to be voiced however.  The weapon of the enemy (an energy field that somehow captures owls and renders them helpless) is kept a complete mystery to the viewer for the duration of the film.  Whether or not it is better explained in the source material books, I cannot say, but aside from requiring tiny little pieces of metal to function, it is nothing more than a one-dimensional plot device here.Also the PG rating should be taken quite seriously as, though animated, this film contains some pretty intense sequences that will surely unsettle the youngsters.  Additionally, even if the kid in question is desensitized to such things, the plot and themes would likely be a bit heavy/ hard to follow for younger tykes.In all though, despite what surely sounds like multiple complaints, Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole' is a surprisingly solid piece of computer generated film.  The story is a bit clich&eacute; yet it still manages to engross, the character and location names are a venerable mystery, yet the story manages to shine through, the 3D revolution may be a fad but the visuals here simply refuse to stop dazzling.  At the end of the day, the movie is 97 minutes of sheer enjoyable adventure: a classic tale of good versus evil, told with animation of absolutely epic proportions.  The fantasy element is quite strong throughout and offers fans of films like the Harry Potter series, Lord of the Rings and Star Wars a fully CG feature to relish.",4,A Sum Far Greater Than Its

I'd have to say that when it comes to the writing it seems that they were able to adapt things from the novels but they went about making it a little different than that of how the books are and changed it up a bit for some to help understand.

So I never liked or accepted the fact that Americans chose and continue to choose the &#34;Bald Eagle&#34; as our national bird...because like owls, etc., these cowards prey upon those less fortunate.  It's kind of in keeping with our sick national policy where here in America, I know of no time when 'we the people' haven't been at war with some country(s)...and like the owls/eagles, we always attack, destroy and rob from those who actually are much smaller and considerably less in number than we are. So I was disappointed that this movie portrayed these Owls as heroic or worthy of my attention beyond loathing them for what they choose to be and do.  Technically, the CGI animation is extremely well done, but as good as it was and as limited it's story line and plot were in the choice of portraying Owls as 'guardians' or something special didn't pan out.  They were owls who hunted, tortured and killed species who were far, far smaller than they were...so there was nothing noble about this species or it's portrayal.  As a human animal watching this movie, it reminded me of just how utterly de-evolved and DEFICIT the human species is...so this 'propaganda film' didn't work for me.  With humanity eating flesh of similarly helpless animals we hunt, farm, torture and kill, I don't need any more lies thrust at me about how evolved humans are when-in-fact our ACTIONS are full proof that we definitely aren't.  This film, although technically might be considered as being well made, is overall a lie that is in keeping with the kind of supreme hypocrisy of human animals eating other animals...so where we all are meat, the cautionary tale and message here that was missed is that we individually and collectively need to adopt and adhere to the truth here 'that IF you don't like the idea of being hunted, herded, and harvested for your flesh, then never, ever do to others what you don't want done to you!!! Here this movie misses on so many levels to lull you into continuing your 'sleep through life' journey of spiritual death so that the gigantic meat profiteers can have you support your own soul's demise.  Owls are just like people here, so there is truth to instruct and guide children to choose a different path and way of life beyond their parent's flesh eating influences.

1393661,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B004AKCMD4,"Underground Reborn ""gnome""","[36, 48]","When I saw the trailer for Legend of the Guardians , I was so excited to see it. One of the main reasons was because it was directed by Zack Snyder and because the animation looked unlike anything I have ever seen in CGI. I finally got to the theaters to see it and I have to say that was let down.First off, the animation was the best part of the whole film. I could not get over how breathtaking the landscapes were and even the way the characters were brought to life. These owls looked so lifelike and while they did talk and fight (yes they actually fought with blades), the way they walked and the way their feathers and wings went against the wind was astounding. The acting was very well done, getting a slew of well known names such as Jim Sturgess, Sam Neil, Hugo Weaving and Abigail Cornish. The only weakness this film had was the plot. I understand that the film was in fact the first 3 novels of this massive story.  The reason it failed was because the film was way too short. The movie started off really, really light and then went really, really dark. There was very little time for character development as well as plot explanation and that would have really helped this film. I have read the premise of these novels and it is an incredible fantasy story. Being able to make this film with the use of CGI gave it tremendous potential to be a great film. Still, when it comes to family oriented films you always have to remember a good portion of your viewers has an attention span of a common field mouse. Because of that major flaw, I would be quite surprised if a sequel is ever made, they have a lot to work on especially if they plan to put another 3 novels into one film. I would love to see possibly a directors cut or an extended version of this film so they can thicken up the story as it should be told.Still, Legend of the Guardians is something worth seeing if not only once. Just the spectacle of it is quite amazing and just seeing how far we have come to making CGI films as real as live action.

What they can't do with modern technology! Many times you'd swear these really were live, movie-screen sized talking owls -- with very expressive eyes that show emotion more clearly than those of many human actors. The dialogue, done by actors with British accents, is imaginative, in that the ""good"" owls talk like what I would imagine middle-class Britons sound, the plug-ugly ""bad"" owls, in a very broad cockney, and the ""rulers"" of The Pure Ones, like members of the nobility. It adds a lot to the story, as given the setting and situations, American accents would have grated on the ear.A few quibbles: Sometimes it's hard to tell which group of owls a particular creature belongs to; the plot can be a little difficult to follow at times; and the mid-air battles between owls, or groups of same, feature such rapid jump-cutting that a certain amount of the action is lost to viewers unless their eyes are much quicker than my aging ones.And, here's my main problem with what is otherwise a fine animated feature: Can't filmmakers ever get over the ""Nazi template"" and move on to some other type of villain? The group name ""The Pure Ones"" is obviously intended to conjure up visions of the Third Reich's race-based ideology. One scene shows the chief villain, making a stentorian speech to a crowd of his followers, and we're supposed to think of Adolf Hitler, thundering at a Nazi rally. An elderly, battle-hardened ""good owl"" has facial features and speech patterns that fairly shout ""Winston Churchill."" As depicted in history books and World War II documentaries, Hitler and his Nazis apparently have left us so handy an image of an ""evil regime"" that filmmakers can't resist returning to it, again and again.Nevertheless, that's a matter of my own personal preferences. I would definitely recommend this movie to those who enjoy a whacking good adventure story, done in modern animated form.",4,Brilliantly done -- but theme is hackneyed,1289606400,"11 13, 2010",2010,2087,"['Legend', 'Guardians', 'brilliant', 'creation', 'telling', 'how', 'Guardians', 'flock', 'good', 'owls', 'plans', 'Pure', 'Ones', 'flock', 'evil', 'owls', 'rule', 'owl', 'world', 'What', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'modern', 'technology', 'Many', 'times', ""'d"", 'swear', 'really', 'were', 'live', 'movie-screen', 'sized', 'talking', 'owls', 'very', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'show', 'emotion', 'more', 'clearly', 'many', 'human', 'actors', 'dialogue', 'done', 'actors', 'British', 'accents', 'imaginative', 'good', 'owls', 'talk', 'what', 'would', 'imagine', 'middle-class', 'Britons', 'sound', 'plug-ugly', 'bad', 'owls', 'very', 'broad', 'cockney', 'rulers', 'Pure', 'Ones', 'members', 'nobility', 'lot', 'story', 'given', 'setting', 'situations', 'American', 'accents', 'would', 'have', 'grated', 'ear.A', 'few', 'quibbles', 'hard', 'tell', 'group', 'owls', 'particular', 'creature', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'difficult', 'follow', 'times', 'mid-air', 'battles', 'owls', 'groups', 'same', 'feature', 'such', 'rapid', 'jump-cutting', 'certain', 'amount', 'action', 'lost', 'viewers', 'eyes', 'are', 'much', 'quicker', 'aging', 'ones.And', 'here', 'main', 'problem', 'what', 'otherwise', 'fine', 'animated', 'feature', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'filmmakers', 'ever', 'get', 'Nazi', 'template', 'move', 'other', 'type', 'villain', 'group', 'name', 'Pure', 'Ones', 'obviously', 'intended', 'conjure', 'up', 'visions', 'Third', 'Reich', 'race-based', 'ideology', 'One', 'scene', 'chief', 'villain', 'making', 'stentorian', 'speech', 'crowd', 'followers', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'think', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'thundering', 'Nazi', 'rally', 'elderly', 'battle-hardened', 'good', 'owl', 'facial', 'features', 'speech', 'patterns', 'fairly', 'shout', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'depicted', 'history', 'books', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'documentaries', 'Hitler', 'Nazis', 'apparently', 'have', 'left', 'so', 'handy', 'image', 'evil', 'regime', 'filmmakers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'returning', 'again', 'again.Nevertheless', 'matter', 'own', 'personal', 'preferences', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'enjoy', 'whacking', 'good', 'adventure', 'story', 'done', 'modern', 'animated', 'form']",N/A
