I was highly impressed with the movie. Lestat is bored. There's nothing worse then having immorality, and being bored. Lestat decideds he wanted to be known, and what the brat king, wants, he gets. Well, some vampires are less than thrilled that Lestat is going public about being a vampire.Lestat brought Akasha, the mother of all vampires to life. The Queen is alive, and wants a King....Lestat. What she wants is simple...hell on earth.This movie has it all. The special effects are incredible. The casting was pretty good. Stuart Townsend was pretty good as Lestat. I pictured Lestat of having more of an ego, but he wasn't bad. Aaliyah was wonderful, just wonderful as Akasha, Queen of the vampires. She's ruthless, deadly, violent as she is beautiful.I cant' say enough good things about this movie. If you like vampires, you have to see this movie. You won't be sorry.

Hart,"[2, 4]","I have been a fan of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles since high school, and am also a fan of the movie adaptation of Interview with the Vampire.This movie, however, is not a part of the Vampire Chronicles. This movie is the worst movie ever.I was frustrated even before the movie started, when the credits said that the film was 'suggested by' an Anne Rice book. And boy, was it ever. This movie is so far off the plotline of the book that it should not even be affiliated with it.Among the most infuriating changes: that Marius was Lestat's maker. He was NOT.That Jessie and Lestat ended up together in the end: they did NOT. Jessie wasn't all that important in the book.The absense of Maharet's twin sister, Mekare: she became quite important when she destroyed Akasha in the book.The soundtrack by Korn: Jonathan Davis, the singer of Korn, has a very easy to distinguish voice, and for anyone even mildly familiar with the band, it is easy to tell that Stuart Townsend (Lestat) is lip-synching to his voice.Now for the positive part; things I liked about this movie: I wasn't all that pissed off about Aaliyah's role in this film. It was pretty decent. And also...uh, OK, that's all.In the end, they shouldn't have bothered to adapt this story to film if they were just going to ruin it. The book makes a hard story to film; it's broad and complex...so leave it be. It would have been easier to adapt the second book, the Vampire Lestat, and I'm sure if that story would have been taken on by the right people, it could have made a great movie, and sequel.Anne Rice fans everywhere: Avoid this disgusting movie.To lovers of badly made big screen tripe everywhere: this is your movie.",1,Horrible,1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,1685,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'high', 'school', 'am', 'also', 'fan', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Interview', 'Vampire.This', 'movie', 'however', 'not', 'part', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'movie', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever.I', 'was', 'frustrated', 'even', 'movie', 'started', 'when', 'credits', 'said', 'film', 'was', ""'suggested"", 'Anne', 'Rice', 'book', 'boy', 'was', 'ever', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'plotline', 'book', 'should', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'affiliated', 'it.Among', 'most', 'infuriating', 'changes', 'Marius', 'was', 'Lestat', 'maker', 'was', 'NOT.That', 'Jessie', 'Lestat', 'ended', 'up', 'together', 'end', 'did', 'NOT', 'Jessie', 'was', ""n't"", 'important', 'book.The', 'absense', 'Maharet', 'twin', 'sister', 'Mekare', 'became', 'quite', 'important', 'when', 'destroyed', 'Akasha', 'book.The', 'soundtrack', 'Korn', 'Jonathan', 'Davis', 'singer', 'Korn', 'very', 'easy', 'distinguish', 'voice', 'anyone', 'even', 'mildly', 'familiar', 'band', 'easy', 'tell', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'Lestat', 'lip-synching', 'voice.Now', 'positive', 'part', 'things', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'pissed', 'off', 'Aaliyah', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'also', 'uh', 'OK', 'all.In', 'end', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered', 'adapt', 'story', 'film', 'were', 'just', 'going', 'ruin', 'book', 'hard', 'story', 'film', 'broad', 'complex', 'so', 'leave', 'be', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'adapt', 'second', 'book', 'Vampire', 'Lestat', ""'m"", 'sure', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'right', 'people', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'movie', 'sequel.Anne', 'Rice', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'Avoid', 'disgusting', 'movie.To', 'lovers', 'badly', 'made', 'big', 'screen', 'tripe', 'everywhere', 'movie']",N/A

Interview With The Vampire, as directed by Neil Jordan, managed to capture the essence of the novel as well as well depict the ever-growing, ever-changing character of Louis as he comes to grips with his newfound existence as an Undead, the love-hate relationship between himself, Lestat (Cruise) and Claudia...and European Vampires vs. American Vampires.  The first movie initially explores the mind of the vampires, their struggles, their tribulations, their trials, their punishment, their feelings of longing, of regret, and more importantly their need for love and companionship.  Townsend plays a horrible Lestat, who generally, has a great sense of humor, a vampire of rebellious nature who is a freedom fighter of the superior race: the vampire race.  Queen of the Damned fails to satisfy as a sequel and hopefully in the future someone will better fill the shoes Neil Jordan managed to fulfill so perfectly.  If you are a true Anne Rice fan, a lover of the Undead and have a passion for all things 'goth' this movie will fail to deliver.  Underplayed characters, imperfect settings, horrible plot.

Sadly, the first part of it, and up until Queen Akasha showed up, was a complete letdown and absolutely horrendous. I thought this film would be whacked to the bottom, until Akasha showed up and went on her killing spree. Then there were some really cool fight scenes and a lot of combusting and blood spilling. To say not a word of Akasha's sexiness and lots of cool lines. The ending was pretty good, and most of the movie's songs were decent at the worst. So if you want something to do, get this DVD and skip to the part from Akasha's appearence on. The first half, though, try to forget it ever existed.

And I could spit in the face of anyone who dares compare Stuart Townsend to Tom Cruise. There's no contest. Tom understood the character, felt for him, became him. Anne Rice, herself, said he was the perfect Lestat and called Townsend's... Whatever that was as being too cold and humourless and not her Lestat but these teeny boppers (Oh, dear, I'm labelling) can't accept that and latch on to what they consider to be a pretty face. Townsend wasn't playing Lestat. He was playing Dracula in a leather coat but I could rant for hours about that.When Tom Cruise played Lestat in Interview with The Vampire there was layers to the personality. The pleading look as he asks 'Do we forgive each other then?' The way he worried for Louis as Louis ran out into the rain, the way he saved Louis from the fire, the angst the personality it was all there.WIth Stuart Townsend you had nothing. The acting was wooden. Shallow. And even if you had never read the Anne Rice novels this movie doesn't stand up on it's own. It makes little sense. And the 'hero' kills innocent girls at random because according to the director's commentary good and evil are too abstract to feed on evil doers as he did in the novels. What's so abstract about killing murderers who feel no remorse? Good and evil were major themes in the book but anyway... Aside from the book this 'hero' had to be told twice that Akasha had killed her old king from two completely different characters. And each time he was surprised. Talk about a short attention span. This movie was designed to appeal to people with a very low IQ and little respect for the original source material, be it Interview with the vampire the movie or the novels. And as a stand alone film I don't think I'd even tolerate it on Mystery science theatre.I did like the songs Forsaken and Not meant for me so I'll give it credit for that but ONLY that.

Spanning centuries of History, the story of the red-headed twins and their encounter with the self-centered Egyptian queen, and the origin of all vampires, all the way down to the final battle was an intense maelstorm of events.  To put that into one movie...impossible.  Anne Rice should have put her energy into a mini-series or at least had faith in her fans to do what Peter Jackson did with LOTR. I was disappointed in the movie. Why did I buy the DVD?  I liked the romantic interplay between Jesse and Lestat!

It takes the heart and soul out of the book and becomes nothing more than a standard B-grade horror movie, albeit with a rather HOT SEXY vampire.  The basic premise of the book is to explain the origins of vampirism in Anne Rice's world.  Central to its plot is the legend of the twins - Maharet and Mekare - the persecution and extermination of their people by Akasha, their forced separation, the origins of Maharet's great family, the origins of the Akasha and the other ancient vampires, and Maharet's quest to find her lost twin.  The movie has none of these, and lost the plot as a result.  Maharet's great family tree appears but the viewer gains no real sense of what it is, why it is so important to Maharet, and Jesse's part in it all.  The ancients appear in it, but are not even named, and again the viewer gains no sense of who they are and why they would plot against Akasha.  And if destroying Akasha were as easy as depicted in the movie, one wonders why the ancients haven't done it ages ago.  And whatever happened to Mekare and her demented zig-zagging trek throughout the world in her hunt for Akasha?  Whoever made this movie tried to squeeze two books into one, and came up with something far inferior to the superb first movie, Interview with the Vampire.

Now, if you go into this movie with an open mind and just see it for what it is, a movie, then you should enjoy it. I saw this movie when it was first released with my brother and we both enjoyed it, I probably more than him. Aaliyah fans are not going to see her much as she does not appear in the film until 45-50 minutes into it and doesn't have much staying power even though the movie and promos say otherwise. With the little part she has in the movie, she does it almost flawlessly. Stuart is one of the modern actors I truly enjoy watching and you're going to see an almost complete opposite in his role as Lestat than that of Tom Cruise's portrayal in Interview...The score to this film is amazingly done by Jonathan Davis (of Korn) and Richard Gibbs. It's haunting and enjoyable enough to hear over and over without annoyance. The movie could have been done a lot better with more time and a better director but for what it is, I love it. It's one of my top 25 favorite movies of all time for the simple reason that I can enjoy every moment of it and watch it outside of what most Rice fans will.

The movie brought the book to life even more wonderful than I'd imagined. This film had a lot to live up to as a sequel... and as a sequel, it failed completely.To enjoy this movie, don't think of it as a sequel. Think of it as a movie all of its own, loosely based on familiar characters. Lestat is no longer himself, but instead rock star vampire with a completely different look and accent. If you can ignore that, and enjoy the loosely fitting perhaps alternate story, you can probably enjoy this movie.Lestat's musical talents are interesting and enjoyable, though I wish they'd done more special effects to his voice. I just didn't find it superhuman enough. On the first note he sings in the movie, his voice is like a dark choir of sound, it's powerful and far beyond human. Later however, his voice seems to turn standard punk rock, nothing special but not bad. Another fault to overlook, then, is what could have been.The movie's rather fast paced, so you won't get bored. It's got good rock sound, vampires crawling everywhere, a decent story so long as you don't expect it to have anything to do with the book. Top it all off with some cool effects.

707862,A2SPVJ5NYCOY00,B000069I1B,Antoinette Avalon,"[0, 1]","This will be a little long but hopefully will help people make an educated choice as to whether this film will be one they will enjoy.  The first thing to understand is that the movie combined both books two and three of Anne Rice's vampire chronicles ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""Queen of the Damned"".  This means that the moviemakers did not attempt to capture every little nuance of the novels.  Realistically, they rarely do.  Anne Rice's ""Queen of the Damned"" while a fascinating read would not in itself necessarily appeal to people who are not Anne Rice fans.  It painstakingly creates a whole heritage for vampires but realistically on film it would have fallen short.  The book ""The Vampire Lestat"" is a wonderful book about Lestat and his bold move to become a rock star and shake up the world of the vampires.  What the filmmakers have done here is plucked out the intent of the stories, the part that would appeal to the mass audience.  It shows Lestat as the irrepressible vampire that he is, doing as he pleases without concern for the consequences.In order to tie the story together the filmmakers used a little artistic license.  To shorten the very LONG story about how Lestat became a vampire and to tie he and the character Marius together quickly, they decided to make Marius the one who turns Lestat into a vampire.  In the grand scheme of things this is minor.  The story as told in the book described an ancient albeit insane vampire that changed Lestat because he found him beautiful then kills himself.  Tying Marius and Lestat together makes sense for the movie.  It established the relationship quickly and certainly didn't hurt anything.  The intent of the story remains intact.Another point many people seem to have missed is Lestat as portrayed in Anne Rice's books is NOT ""homosexual"" in the classic sense of the word.  He can't HAVE sex in her books, except for a brief jaunt as a human in ""Tale of the Body Thief"".  He does not think in terms of gender in her novels.  It is a person's very being, who they are, that attracts him since he is always in search of kindred spirits to share eternity with.Lastly, the filmmakers have taken some artistic license with the other characters.  They eliminated the character Maharet's mad sister.  They do not actually tell you in the movie the names of the vampires that band against Akasha, Queen of the Damned, other than Maharet and Marius.  The decision to de-emphasize the ancient vampires was a good idea because their own stories are irrelevant to this movie.  It doesn't affect the outcome of the story.  They destroy Akasha less brutally than in the book but again, the outcome is basically the same.Then there is the character of Jesse, Maharet's human descendant.  Jesse becomes Lestat's love interest in the movie whereas in the book she ended up with a broken neck at the rock concert and Maharet is the one who turns her into a vampire.  This piece of artistic license is an interesting twist and works quite well.  Lestat in Anne Rice's novels does have a tendency to become enamoured of an individual for a variety of reasons and the way they weave Jesse into this slightly different role for the movie is not out of keeping with the characters.One last thing people may find criticism in is the filmmakers did not attempt to make Stuart Townsend a blonde for his role as Lestat.  It doesn't matter.  Townsend BECOMES Lestat for this film and it beats the heck out of the horrible dye job they did on Tom Cruise.  Townsend has the delicate, aristocratic features Lestat is supposed to have and emanates the raw physical attractiveness that the ""Brat Prince"" Lestat is supposed to possess.  I would personally love to see him play Lestat opposite Brad Pitt as Louis.  He is the first actor in a long time I've seen that could hold his own next to Pitt.Having established what somebody who has read Anne Rice's books may notice or even find to be a shortcoming, let me address the film itself.  The story is about the vampire Lestat who decides to become a rock star to stir up the world of the vampires.  In the process he awakens Akasha, the ""Mother"" of all vampires who has been in a trance-like state for centuries.  Akasha comes for Lestat, saving him from the angry vampires and it quickly becomes apparent she is completely insane.  It is then up to the ancient vampires that know of her existence to destroy her.The actors are wonderful. Aaliyah plays the queen to perfection, evil and immoral.  Stuart Townsend IS Lestat in this movie, bold, beautiful and constantly at odds with everything.  The movie does the seemingly impossible.  It weaves two of Anne Rice's wonderful books together into one visually spectacular piece.  The songs written specifically for the soundtrack are exactly what one would imagine Lestat would write, raging against everything while giving away the vampire's deepest secrets.Overall, if you like vampire movies you're going to love this one.  If you're an Anne Rice fan with an open mind for some artistic license you should love the film as well.  It doesn't follow her books EXACTLY like ""Interview With the Vampire"" did but the end result is wonderful.  While Tom Cruise did a surprisingly good job as Lestat in ""Interview"" Stuart Townsend BECAME Lestat for ""Queen of the Damned"".  As a writer myself I understand that rarely if ever does an author have any input on a film once the screenplay is sold.  If I were Anne Rice, I would be very happy with the way they treated my characters and brought them to life.",5,Stuart Townsend IS Lestat!,1032393600,"09 19, 2002",2002,5540,"['will', 'be', 'little',

707863,A2AFBVM5O9R09V,B000069I1B,"Arish ""A+""","[2, 2]","A chopped up, made up, story that is a long cheesy music Video!This is O.K but I would have done it a bit differently. First of all the screenwriters would have been the first to go! I would have gotten Neil Jordon back or Frances Ford Cappola (Bram Stokers Dracula Fame)! Second of all Aaliyah would have went through extensive vocal and acting lesson's or else. Then I would have waited on Tom Cruise to play Lestat again. Then I would have asked WB to give me a bigger budget so everything wouldn't look so fake, glossy & overdone as it did in this film. What happened to the twins Maharet and Makere? What happened to the history of how Vampirism Started? I mean after all, she was the ""Mother of all Vampires"". What happened to the Decapitation at the end of Queen Akasha? And Marius wasn't even supposed to be around because Akasha trapped him in a ice prison. Jesse's neck was broken at the concert so how was she suppose to be kicking it with Lestat? Actually they never met in the book..it was all passion between he and the Queen. These were things that were explained in the book that they totally didn't touch in the film! Acutally they didn't even touch on Egypt at all! They didn't even show the power and how regal the Queen really was. In the book there was revenge that was wanted by the Twins because Akasha tortured them centuries ago and seperated them. Floating them both in stone coffin's one to the East the other to the West!That was a huge suspense factorin the book. In the movie she had no enemies there wasn't any suspense. And Marahet didn't have a sister nor was see aggressive in any way. Queen Akasha was a human in the beginning but was consumed by a Blood sucking Spirit ""Amil"". What happened to the Blood God Azim, that Akasha despised and destroyed in one instant? Because she had come back to Reign and he was in the way.  Did they explain any of this in the movie NOOOOOOOO! They were too busy talking about the irrelivant character Lestat. In the book Lestat was relevant but in as a supporting character not the main character. I thought the movie was called ""Queen of the Damned?"" This movie was a made up ...and just took Anne rice's characters and misused them. This isn't an adaptation of the book this is a totally different situation. I also think Salma Hayek would have been a better Queen after seeing her perfomance in ""Dusk Til DAWN""! Also that girl from ""The Mummy"" wouldn't have been a bad choice! I think Aaliyah was sexy but I do think she needed more experience in acting to convey an important character like this. But with a scrip that horrible I think she was the only one up for it. I gave this movie 3 stars simply for Aaliyah's sex appeal nothing more the script was a disappointment. Queen of the Damned could have been the best Vampire flick ever made. But was destroyed by unworthy and unprofessional directors and screenwriters. This movie could have ,if it had of followed the book would have superceded ""Bram stokers Dracula"". Well, maybe someone will redo it and make it right next time. But they can't call it Queen of the Damned  because that name will be damaged forever! I think I will start writing a script and call it ""Akasha-The Vampire Chronicles!"" I could have conveyed that book in 2 and a Half hours and it would have explained everything! The first 15 mins before the credits started I could have explained the whole torture of the Twins and the transformation of the Queen. Then after the credits I would have started off showing how the Queen slayed egypt! But anyway no sense in talking about this, it is done and done very wrong! This movie should have been PG-13 I don't see where there is any graphic violence other than the club scene. This is far from scary..but the book was horrible, loaded with graphic violence. They really ruined this story it delivers nothing unusual or horrifying. This is a enjoyable film if you never read the book. The book is such a work of mastery! And the sensuality passion & suspense it reaks was not conveyed in this film at all.Start Reading!Arish",3,"""A chance to explain the 1st living Vampire What do we get?",1046649600,"03 3, 2003",2003,4070,"['chopped', 'up', 'made', 'up', 'story', 'long', 'cheesy', 'music', 'Video', 'O.K', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'bit', 'differently', 'First', 'screenwriters', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'go', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'Neil', 'Jordon', 'back', 'Frances', 'Ford', 'Cappola', 'Bram', 'Stokers', 'Dracula', 'Fame', 'Second', 'Aaliyah', 'would', 'have', 'went', 'extensive', 'vocal', 'acting', 'lesson', 'else', 'Then', 'would', 'have', 'waited', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'play', 'Lestat', 'again', 'Then', 'would', 'have', 'asked', 'WB', 'give', 'bigger', 'budget', 'everything', 'would', ""n't"", 'look', 'so', 'fake', 'glossy', 'overdone', 'did', 'film', 'What', 'happened', 'twins', 'Maharet', 'Makere', 'What', 'happened', 'history', 'how', 'Vampirism', 'Started', 'mean', 'was', 'Mother', 'Vampires', 'What', 'happened', 'Decapitation', 'end', 'Queen', 'Akasha', 'Marius', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'supposed', 'be', 'around', 'Akasha', 'trapped', 'ice', 'prison', 'Jesse', 'neck', 'was', 'broken', 'concert', 'how', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'kicking', 'Lestat', 'Actually', 'never', 'met', 'book..it', 'was', 'passion', 'Queen', 'were', 'things', 'were', 'explained', 'book', 'totally', 'did', ""n't"", 'touch', 'film', 'Acutally', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'touch', 'Egypt', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'power', 'how', 'regal', 'Queen', 'really', 'was', 'book', 'was', 'revenge', 'was', 'wanted', 'Twins', 'Akasha', 'tortured', 'centuries', 'ago', 'seperated', 'Floating', 'stone', 'coffin', 'one', 'East', 'other', 'West', 'was', 'huge', 'suspense', 'factorin', 'book', 'movie', 'had', 'enemies', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'suspense', 'Marahet', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'sister', 'was', 'see', 'aggressive', 'way', 'Queen', 'Akasha', 'was', 'human', 'beginning', 'was', 'consumed', 'Blood', 'sucking', 'Spirit', 'Amil', 'What', 'happened', 'Blood', 'God', 'Azim', 'Akasha', 'despised', 'destroyed', 'one', 'instant', 'had', 'come', 'back', 'Reign', 'was', 'way', 'Did', 'explain', 'movie', 'NOOOOOOOO', 'were', 'too', 'busy', 'talking', 'irrelivant', 'character', 'Lestat', 'book', 'Lestat', 'was', 'relevant', 'supporting', 'character', 'not', 'main', 'character', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'called', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'up', 'just', 'took', 'Anne', 'rice', 'characters', 'misused', ""n't"", 'adaptation', 'book', 'totally', 'different', 'situation', 'also', 'think', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Queen', 'seeing', 'perfomance', 'Dusk', 'Til', 'DAWN', 'Also', 'girl', 'Mummy', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'choice', 'think', 'Aaliyah', 'was', 'sexy', 'do', 'think', 'needed', 'more', 'experience', 'acting', 'convey', 'important', 'character', 'scrip', 'horrible', 'think', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'up', 'gave', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'simply', 'Aaliyah', 'sex', 'appeal', 'nothing', 'more', 'script', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'Vampire', 'flick', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'destroyed', 'unworthy', 'unprofessional', 'directors', 'screenwriters', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'followed', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'superceded', 'Bram', 'stokers', 'Dracula', 'Well', 'maybe', 'someone', 'will', 'redo', 'make', 'right', 'next', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'call', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'name', 'will', 'be', 'damaged', 'forever', 'think', 'will', 'start', 'writing', 'script', 'call', 'Akasha-The', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'could', 'have', 'conveyed', 'book', '2', 'Half', 'hours', 'would', 'have', 'explained', 'everything', 'first', '15', 'mins', 'credits', 'started', 'could', 'have', 'explained', 'whole', 'torture', 'Twins', 'transformation', 'Queen', 'Then', 'credits', 'would', 'have', 'started', 'off', 'showing', 'how', 'Queen', 'slayed', 'egypt', 'anyway', 'sense', 'talking', 'done', 'done', 'very', 'wrong', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'PG-13', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'where', 'graphic', 'violence', 'other', 'club', 'scene', 'far', 'scary..but', 'book', 'was', 'horrible', 'loaded', 'graphic', 'violence', 'really', 'ruined', 'story', 'nothing', 'unusual', 'horrifying', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'book', 'such', 'work', 'mastery', 'sensuality', 'passion', 'suspense', 'was', 'not', 'conveyed', 'film', 'all.Start', 'Reading', 'Arish']",N/A

I enjoyed the first film dealing with Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and Neil Jordan's Interview with a Vampire was a very good adaptation of the book of the same title. I knew going in that Queen of the Damned wouldn't have the same pedigree that Jordan's film had, but at least I thought the film would be entertaining in the least. I was so very wrong. The only thing good to say about Queen of the Damned was that Stuart Townsend made a better and more believable Lestat than Tom Cruise. Aaliyah's portrayal of Akashe, Mother of All Vampires, was adequate and didn't really ruin the character for me. It's just a shame that the final film project she was in was this one. She had charisma and talent that hinted at stardom in the film industry. Queen of the Damned is the kind of film that helps perpetuate that camp and cheesiness of the neo-goth and punk vampire scene.

707876,A26GI8N3ADWGZ5,B000069I1B,"bsy ""bern""","[2, 3]","One thing that separated Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles from the hundreds of vampire drivel out there was her ability to develop deeply-layered characters that we could immediately identify with. Each one from Lestat to Pandora to Marius, had their own inner battles that served as an umbilical cord to their humanity. That along with the rich historic origins of vampirism exquisitely detailed from vampire to vampire, lent an aura of romanticism that few other writers could develop. The book, Queen of the Damned, connected the past with the present and introduced us to the group of immortals who hold the survival of fellow vampires in their hands. Queen of the Damned the movie, on the other hand, is just plain bad. From acting, writing, casting, directing, all facets of this exercise, which in essence is just a music video, utterly and miserably fail.After years of hibernation, Lestat awakes in the 20th century and decides to ""come clean"" and cause a ruckus as he usually does. This he does by writing an autobiography (the Vampire Lestat) and joining a rock band and thereby announcing to the world the secret of the cabal. This, as you can imagine is not taken lightly by the other bloodsuckers who revel in their nonexistence, living on the fringes of society. The vampire nation decides it's time that Lestat shuts up forever. At the same time, Akasha, literally the mother of all vampires, is also awakened and decides to enforce her vision of utopia on the suspecting world.Never have I seen such a bland, untalented, and unmotivated group of actors. Stuart Townsend plays a wooden and stiff Lestat who seems bored except when on stage. Aaliyah is truly miscast as Akasha. The scene where she enters a vampire bar is pure comedy. The few actors of substance like Lena Olin, are barely given any screen time. The dialogue is reminiscent of a cartoon. There are far too many vampire bar scenes where fashion attire is the only reason the scenes were shot. Black leather and heavy makeup, this is a good advert for the goth-look but nothing more. It fs image and style over content and substance. It's no wonder that Anne Rice disassociated herself from it.There seems to be a slew of directors from the MTV music video school of film making and though some learn enough to eventually make a decent film, the majority are better suited for commercials or even better yet, music videos. As long as it looks good, then it's fine. Eye candy works for a 5 minute music video but not for a 2.0hrs film. I didn't expect them to follow the storyline which is fine but it's clear that they chose this route only to appeal to the younger audiences in the same way they cast Townsend and Aaliyah. Demographically, I don't think the majority of Anne Rice's readers are teenagers. The only positive reviews I read, extol the beauty and looks of Townsend and Aailyah as reasons for liking the movie. Sorry but that's not enough for me and many others. I have made a note of those involved in this fiasco from the director to producers and will avoid anything they are involved in like the bubonic plague.",1,The Horror....,1053561600,"05 22, 2003",2003,3106,"['One', 'thing', 'separated', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'hundreds', 'vampire', 'drivel', 'there', 'was', 'ability', 'develop', 'deeply-layered', 'characters', 'could', 'immediately', 'identify', 'one', 'Lestat', 'Pandora', 'Marius', 'had', 'own', 'inner', 'battles', 'served', 'umbilical', 'cord', 'humanity', 'rich', 'historic', 'origins', 'vampirism', 'exquisitely', 'detailed', 'vampire', 'vampire', 'lent', 'aura', 'romanticism', 'few', 'other', 'writers', 'could', 'develop', 'book', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'connected', 'past', 'present', 'introduced', 'group', 'immortals', 'who', 'hold', 'survival', 'fellow', 'vampires', 'hands', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'acting', 'writing', 'casting', 'directing', 'facets', 'exercise', 'essence', 'just', 'music', 'video', 'utterly', 'miserably', 'fail.After', 'years', 'hibernation', 'Lestat', '20th', 'century', 'come', 'clean', 'cause', 'ruckus', 'usually', 'writing', 'autobiography', 'Vampire', 'Lestat', 'joining', 'rock', 'band', 'thereby', 'announcing', 'world', 'secret', 'cabal', 'can', 'imagine', 'not', 'taken', 'lightly', 'other', 'bloodsuckers', 'who', 'revel', 'nonexistence', 'living', 'fringes', 'society', 'vampire', 'nation', 'time', 'Lestat', 'up', 'forever', 'same', 'time', 'Akasha', 'literally', 'mother', 'vampires', 'also', 'awakened', 'decides', 'enforce', 'vision', 'utopia', 'suspecting', 'have', 'seen', 'bland', 'untalented', 'unmotivated', 'group', 'actors', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'wooden', 'stiff', 'Lestat', 'who', 'bored', 'when', 'stage', 'Aaliyah', 'truly', 'miscast', 'Akasha', 'scene', 'where', 'vampire', 'bar', 'pure', 'comedy', 'few', 'actors', 'substance', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'are', 'barely', 'given', 'screen', 'time', 'dialogue', 'reminiscent', 'cartoon', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'vampire', 'bar', 'scenes', 'where', 'fashion', 'attire', 'only', 'reason', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'Black', 'leather', 'heavy', 'makeup', 'good', 'advert', 'goth-look', 'nothing', 'more', 'fs', 'image', 'style', 'content', 'substance', 'wonder', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'disassociated', 'it.There', 'be', 'slew', 'directors', 'MTV', 'music', 'video', 'school', 'film', 'making', 'learn', 'enough', 'eventually', 'make', 'decent', 'film', 'majority', 'are', 'better', 'suited', 'commercials', 'even', 'better', 'yet', 'music', 'videos', 'As', 'long', 'good', 'then', 'fine', 'Eye', 'candy', 'works', '5', 'minute', 'music', 'video', 'not', '2.0hrs', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'follow', 'storyline', 'fine', 'clear', 'chose', 'route', 'only', 'appeal', 'younger', 'audiences', 'same', 'way', 'cast', 'Townsend', 'Aaliyah', 'Demographically', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'majority', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'readers', 'are', 'teenagers', 'only', 'positive', 'reviews', 'read', 'extol', 'beauty', 'looks', 'Townsend', 'Aailyah', 'reasons', 'liking', 'movie', 'Sorry', 'not', 'enough', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'made', 'note', 'involved', 'fiasco', 'director', 'producers', 'will', 'avoid', 'anything', 'are', 'involved', 'bubonic', 'plague']",N/A

The premise itself is silly of the vampire Lestat becoming an 80s rock star.I never thought I'd be giving its film adaptation 5 stars.`Queen of the Damned' the film is able to turn lead into gold thanks to director Michael Rymer's VERY artsy directing. The photography is truly breath taking. The soundtrack is provided by several heavy metal players who took a sabbatical from their bands just to write and perform songs for this film. Too bad these songs didn't get more press, they're right up there with Trent Reznor and Marylyn Manson when they were at their peak.The Plot: of `Queen of the Damned' is a convoluted mix of several dozen of Anne Rice's characters coming together for a reunion.First there's Lestat (Stewart Townsend) who decides to make a come back in the 21st century by being a rock star. Yes Lestat goes on MTV holds press conferences and plays heavy metal concerts. While this was cheesy in the book, Michael Rymer makes it work with the beautiful photography and soundtrack I mentioned.The main focus of the story is on Rice's Talamasca society of Euro trash which monitors paranormal activity... this would include vampires... but never interferes. But one of their members is the naive and curious Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) whose foster mother is one of the first vampires ever, Maharet (Lena Olin) starts interfering.Things are complicated when the Eve of all vampires Akasha (Aaliyah) awakes and starts massacring other vampires. Akasha and her husband were the first vampires in Egypt and became the basis for the legend of Osiris and Isis.The two lay catatonic in the care of Marius (Vincent Perez), a third generation vampire.The film totally bastardizes the origin of Lestat and Armand by trying to combine the two. Making it seem as though Marius spawned Lestat. Totally false! The origins of Lestat and Armand are very interesting and compelling and it's a shame to see them so summarily marginalized.Spoiler warning: As I said the plot is convoluted and ends with the vampires uniting against Akasha and Lestat turning Jesse. In the book the significance of the plot was that Lestat befriends the Talamasca's leader David (Paul McGann) which does not occur in the film.Unfortunately `Queen of the Damned' was only billed as Aaliyah's final performance. Her acting neither helps nor hurts this film.`Queen of the Damned' isn't for people who like vampires it's for people who can truly appreciate great film making with some of the best photography I've seen in the history of film!

QUEEN OF THE DAMNED suffers from a multitude of disadvantages not experienced by the previous INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, but I'll only mention the two most glaring ones.

Second, it doesn't have a star nearly as game as Tom Cruise was(contrary to some, he was actually quite good)--instead, we get Micheal Rymer and Stuart Townsend, who are simply no Jordan or Cruise.  Townsend is utterly awful as Lestat--playing him as a rock star, he has about as much charisma as a doorknob.  It's simply one of the worst performances that I've seen in some time.  The rest of the cast seems to be stuck in limbo--even usually great actors like Vincent Perez and Lena Olin are wasted (and they should thank the stars they have as little screen time as they do). As for Aaliyah, sorry to say she's no heat and all hot air as the title character, though she still fares better than Townsend.

I never made it past Interview, and in fact couldn't make way all the way to end of that one either (I think I stopped around page 2,453 or so). I guess it's interesting in theory bringing a Renaissance Faire sensibility to vampire lore, but I'm not remotely in Rice's target demographic. So all the purple prose and stilted declamatory dialogue that Rice has taken to several offshore banks does nothing for me, except me want to go read something else. I wasn't a fan of the first movie, since all I could think was how silly Cruise and Pitt looked dressed like the backup band for the Army of Lovers.So why did I like Queen of the Damned? Well, first of all it was a low-budget, non-star drive-in kind of flick and I brought absolutely no expectations to the table. Stuart Townsend and Vincent Perez disappear quite nicely into their roles, since I feel pulp flicks are better served with less-familiar faces than megastars like Cruise.It also had a more appealing eye candy vibe to a crotchety old breeder like me. Aaliyah was somewhat androgynous but very easy on the eyes, and Margeurite Moreau has a lovely and edgy continental appeal. I liked the modern day setting better than the colonial millieu of Interview and the admittedly preposterous Lestat as Marilyn Manson conceit gave the film the low-rent amphetamine vibe dopey crap like vampire movie need to keep me awake.

707887,A3E8BTA2SXPV3P,B000069I1B,cinemagirl,"[3, 4]","Being a huge Anne Rice fan, I looked forward to this film so much that it was embarrassing. When I heard that this film was going into production, I imagined that this was going to be like ""Interview with the Vampire,"" which was an elegant film that hit all the right notes. It had great direction, the DP was spot on,  and all the necessary parts were adapted from the book.This film starts off OK. For the first few seconds, a great gothic song plays as the visuals are languidly revealed. Then: Lestat starts speaking. I am not familiar with Stuart Townsend's work; maybe he's a great actor, who knows. But it doesn't show here. He's clearly miscast for more reasons than one. This is beyond the fact that those in charge changed Lestat's hair color because Townsend just didn't look right with blonde hair. Under normal circumstances, this little physical detail wouldn't be such a big deal. However, Lestat's blonde hair is inextricable from the character himself. When most people think of Marilyn Monroe, they think of her as a blonde. She's just not Bombshell Marilyn without it. The same thing applies to Lestat. Aside from this, Townsend's acting barely passes. Quite frankly, he looks bored throughout the film. He lacks the subtlety and finesse to play Lestat. Instead of going without an accent, which would have been a much better choice given the circumstances, Townsend decided to adopt a nebulous, pseudo-sophisticated one -- one he figured would sound cool coming out of the mouth of a vampire. Good thing that Tom Cruise decided not to do an accent for ""Interview."" Townsend's accent is too distracting. This recalls Antonio Banderas' Latino accent in the role of Armand. Although this was completely off in terms of keeping with the book (Armand is a young Russian boy), Banderas embraced the role and made it his own. In my opinion, if you're going to deviate from the book, at least throw yourself into the role and try to be so good at being whatever new character you've become that the audience won't care you're ignoring how it's supposed to be. Hardly any of the characters do this in ""Queen.""Vincent Perez does the best he can in the role. As Marius, he's one of the least annoying parts of the film because he seems to handle all of this campiness quite naturally. Marguerite Moreau, who in real life is genuinely interested in vampires, also fares pretty well as the vamp-seeking Jesse. There is really no way for me to judge Aalyia's acting -- the strange costume, the stiff, Egyptian-like dance moves and mannerisms she was told to do -- all of this smacks of poor direction. The actors never truly assume their roles; instead, they act out caricatures. It is as if the director went around and went, ""OK, you, Townsend, you're Bela Lugosi...only modern, sexier, and French (or something like that, whatever you come up with will be cool with me)...you, Aalyia, you're like, Egyptian, so you're gonna bellydance your way through this and act all, um, Egyptian, whatever that means.""Michael Rymer is not a big-time Hollywood director, and it certainly isn't necessary for a person to be one in order to create a competent adaptation. The big problem is, and this is confirmed in a chat with him, he has absolutely no interest in the subject. For him, this film was a fun thing to do in between ""real"" jobs. His objective was to create a film that would appeal to angst-ridden goth teens, thereby making a quick buck at the box office.In spite of all this negativity, there are some good points. The soundtrack, largely created by Jonathan Davis of Korn, sets the appropriate mood for the film (but it might not be what those who adhere to the book might expect). Lestat's '80s sound receives an update and is replaced by the type of music performed by Marilyn Manson and Disturbed. Both the soundtrack and the score are well worth the listen. Also, a few scenes are memorable and quite well-done (the scenes with the musicians on the beach and the doomed groupies), almost reminicent of ""Interview,"" although this can be a misleading statement; perhaps some scenes were simply not as awful as some others.The audience I sat with laughed throughout the film at parts that were not meant to be funny. Campy works in many cases. But I think that Anne Rice deserves much better, and that many fans, given their longtime devotion, deserve a film that have experienced directors and screenwriter(s) on board. Anne's books are lush, filled with extraordinary detail and atmosphere; adaptatons should recreate that same feeling on screen. This film had a limited budjet, and many scenes in it scream, ""We are on a budget!""For reasons most fans know already, this film was rushed...and it shows. Painfully. The sets look cheap, the costumes out of some second-rate costume shop one visits for Halloween, the make-up sloppy and caked-on, the dialogue poorly written and delivered, and the special effects are laughable. ""Interview"" was a carefully woven tapestry, conjuring up images of things gilded, ornate, Old World. ""Queen"" is like one of those made-for-TV movies that pop up every year around Halloween. It is the perfect film to satisfy that need to see something mind-numbingly silly for a couple of hours, nothing more. In the end, it fulfills Rymer's shallow objective. Neil Jordan, you were sorely missed.",2,I suppose it's not a good thing when the audience laughs...,1099958400,"11 9, 2004",2004,5337,"['Being', 'huge', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'fan', 'looked', 'forward',

I also realize the movie does not have a whole lot in common with the book. Having made those two points, I will now post my review based on the MOVIE (not the book):First, while the tagline is stupid, the movie is not! Two things stuck out for me about the film: the inherent sexiness that typifies the modern vampire and the INCREDIBLE soundtrack. Between Stuart Townsend, Paul McGann (of ""Horatio Hornblower""), and Vincent Perez, I was in heaven! The sets were great, the costumes awesome, and the actors pretty good. I've always like the gothic/vamp rock subculture, so the idea of a vamp musician was a pretty easy segue for me.Yes, I do realize how different this movie is from the books,I like it regardless. While I LOVE Rice's flair for description/detail in writing, I think that much of her work is repetitive and overrated. This movie, I believe, is BETTER than the books. It is more of a work of fanfiction (banned by Rice, btw) than anything else: a love of characters in a setting that would flourish. It really does not matter whether or not you are a fan of Anne Rice - this movie doesn't need a precendent.

From special effects that look like left-over CGI work from ""The Matrix,"" to the hard rock and heavy metal music that permeates much of today's horror fare, this ""Queen"" is a royal pain.The story is based on the novel from Anne Rice, who penned the now-famous ""Interview With the Vampire,"" which was also made into a motion picture. ""Queen,"" being the third in a series of four books, begins with the introduction of Lestat (Stuart Townsend), who has awakened from a deep sleep to resume his machinations on Earth. After converting a hard rock band into his personal entourage, he makes himself known publicly to the world, summoning his fellow vampires to join him in his openness.But does everyone buy into it? Or does the whole world, save for a handful of mortal characters, look at is as a publicity stunt? Once his presence has been announced, and his fame sealed, Lestat soon finds himself the subject of fascination by Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), a young woman affiliated with a London-based association that studies the dealings of the underworld without dabbling in it themselves. Of course, being youthful and stupid, Jesse becomes entranced by Lestat after reading his journal, which reveals his inner torments and his love for Akasha (Aaliyah), known by vampires as ""the queen of all who are damned.""If you're wondering where all of this is going, then you're probably not going to get much satisfaction from the film itself. The movie finds a comfort zone in the reminiscence of Lestat's past as read by Jesse, and for a few, fleeting moments, the movie looks as though it will take off. But then we are cast back into the less-entertaining subplots, as Jesse pleads with him to make her immortal, while Akasha, returning in (literally) a blaze of glory, seeks him out to make him her new king.Putting the movie's faithfulness to the book aside, the story presented here is just plain messy, jumping to and fro between past and present, setting and setting, with little attention to its characters' emotions or to coherence. I must give the movie credit for attempting to evoke sympathy for Lestat, but why does he feel burdened by immortality, when the film itself is constantly reverting to its pro-vampire appeal? And where's the fear factor? What's so scary about Akasha, who points at things and causes them to combust?You do have to give director Michael Rymer credit for at least trying to put a stylish spin on the film. ""Queen"" has all the dismal glitz and gothic radiance money can buy, but it's all been done before, and much better. The fancy choreography of action and fight sequences can be attributed to the recent rage in such fanciful tactics spun from movies like ""The Matrix"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" The film's overall edge, from the music to the quick cuts, is reminiscent of the far-superior ""Blade,"" and since when does a movie have to make your ears bleed to be interesting?The casting also turns out to be one of the film's pitfalls. Since much of the movie is guided by narration on the part of Lestat and Jesse, cast members Townsend and Moreau provide voice-overs that, oddly enough, are devoid of any suspense or intensity. Their performances onscreen are credible enough, though Townsend is no Bela Lugosi, or even Gary Oldman; for vampire, he doesn't carry the presence needed to evoke chills. As for the now-deceased Aaliyah, it's hard to say: the movie provides her with little dialogue, and she is onscreen for maybe a total of fifteen minutes, barely enough time to make any decision as to her talent.While I was watching ""Queen of the Damned,"" my mind was elsewhere, thinking about far better vampire-oriented films like ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" or ""Blade,"" and even ""Dracula 2000,"" which is similar in its stylistic intent to this film. I have yet to read a page of Anne Rice's ""Vampire Chronicles;"" after seeing the film, it's not on the top of my list, either. The film lacks intensity, energy, suspense, and originality; in short, it's about as lively as the blood that flows through Akasha's veins.",2,"This ""Queen"" is a royal pain.",1014681600,"02 26, 2002",2002,4303,"['Queen', 'Damned', 'latest', 'long', 'long', 'long', 'line', 'vampires-gone-amok', 'movies', 'elements', 'borrowed', 'various', 'different', 'films', 'are', 'easily', 'spotted', 'none', 'are', 'least', 'bit', 'interesting', 'fun', 'special', 'effects', 'look', 'left-over', 'CGI', 'work', 'Matrix', 'hard', 'rock', 'heavy', 'metal', 'music', 'much', 'today', 'horror', 'fare', 'Queen', 'royal', 'pain.The', 'story', 'based', 'novel', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'who', 'penned', 'now-famous', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'was', 'also', 'made', 'motion', 'picture', 'Queen', 'being', 'third', 'series', 'four', 'books', 'introduction', 'Lestat', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'who', 'awakened', 'deep', 'sleep', 'resume', 'machinations', 'Earth', 'converting', 'hard', 'rock', 'band', 'personal', 'entourage', 'known', 'publicly', 'world', 'summoning', 'fellow', 'vampires', 'join', 'openness.But', 'everyone', 'buy', 'whole', 'world', 'save', 'handful', 'mortal', 'characters', 'look', 'publicity', 'stunt', 'presence', 'been', 'announced', 'fame', 'sealed', 'Lestat', 'soon', 'subject', 'fascination', 'Jesse', 'Marguerite', 'Moreau', 'young', 'woman', 'affiliated', 'London-based', 'association', 'studies', 'dealings', 'underworld', 'dabbling', 'course', 'being', 'youthful', 'stupid', 'Jesse', 'entranced', 'Lestat', 'reading', 'journal', 'inner', 'torments', 'love', 'Akasha', 'Aaliyah', 'known', 'vampires', 'queen', 'who', 'are', 'damned', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'where', 'going', 'then', ""'re"", 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'much', 'satisfaction', 'film', 'movie', 'comfort', 'zone', 'reminiscence', 'Lestat', 'past', 'read', 'Jesse', 'few', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'movie', 'will', 'take', 'off', 'then', 'are', 'cast', 'back', 'less-entertaining', 'subplots', 'Jesse', 'pleads', 'make', 'immortal', 'Akasha', 'returning', 'literally', 'blaze', 'glory', 'out', 'make', 'new', 'king.Putting', 'movie', 'faithfulness', 'book', 'aside', 'story', 'presented', 'here', 'just', 'plain', 'messy', 'jumping', 'fro', 'past', 'present', 'setting', 'setting', 'little', 'attention', 'characters', 'emotions', 'coherence', 'must', 'give', 'movie', 'credit', 'attempting', 'evoke', 'sympathy', 'Lestat', 'why', 'feel', 'burdened', 'immortality', 'when', 'film', 'constantly', 'reverting', 'pro-vampire', 'appeal', 'where', 'fear', 'factor', 'What', 'so', 'scary', 'Akasha', 'who', 'things', 'combust', 'do', 'have', 'give', 'director', 'Michael', 'Rymer', 'credit', 'least', 'trying', 'put', 'stylish', 'spin', 'film', 'Queen', 'dismal', 'glitz', 'gothic', 'radiance', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'been', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'fancy', 'choreography', 'action', 'fight', 'sequences', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'recent', 'rage', 'such', 'fanciful', 'tactics', 'spun', 'movies', 'Matrix', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'film', 'overall', 'edge', 'music', 'quick', 'cuts', 'reminiscent', 'far-superior', 'Blade', 'when', 'movie', 'have', 'make', 'ears', 'bleed', 'be', 'interesting', 'casting', 'also', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'film', 'pitfalls', 'much', 'movie', 'guided', 'narration', 'part', 'Lestat', 'Jesse', 'cast', 'members', 'Townsend', 'Moreau', 'provide', 'voice-overs', 'oddly', 'enough', 'are', 'devoid', 'suspense', 'intensity', 'performances', 'are', 'credible', 'enough', 'Townsend', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'even', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'vampire', ""n't"", 'carry', 'presence', 'needed', 'evoke', 'chills', 'now-deceased', 'Aaliyah', 'hard', 'say', 'movie', 'little', 'dialogue', 'onscreen', 'maybe', 'total', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'barely', 'enough', 'time', 'make', 'decision', 'talent.While', 'was', 'watching', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'mind', 'was', 'elsewhere', 'thinking', 'far', 'better', 'vampire-oriented', 'films', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', 'Blade', 'even', 'Dracula', '2000', 'similar', 'stylistic', 'intent', 'film', 'have', 'yet', 'read', 'page', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'seeing', 'film', 'not', 'top', 'list', 'either', 'film', 'intensity', 'energy', 'suspense', 'originality', 'short', 'as', 'lively', 'blood', 'Akasha', 'veins']",N/A

Pretend this film has nothing to do with the Vampire Chronicle books (which it doesn't, but is supposed to). I did and actually found myself enjoying parts of this much as I do your standard Saturday afternoon B-movie or a ripping good MST3K.One thing I greatly enjoyed was the character of Marius. In fact, I liked him better than the original. Initially, I was intrigued with Marius as he was originally written. Then the author imbued him with all the charm of a funny Uncle Bad Touch and the intrigue vaporized. This Marius is nothing like that character. He has a witty and playful sense of humor and I loved the way he toyed with Giles - I mean David. David too was well played and well rounded and both characters provided welcome relief from the ghastly plotting and performances infecting the rest of this film.But, aside from the director's indecision as to whether he was doing overblown melodrama or high camp, what was seriously flawed about this effort? What relegated this to the MST3K vault? Editorial decisions. Scenes that were cut because they &quot;would have made the film too long.&quot; I'm certainly not suggesting their inclusion would have put this in Oscar contention, but they would have worked wonders for continuity and clarification.Lestat's entire backstory for instance. Too long. Unnecessary. Cut it and put it in the &quot;bonus materials&quot; section. More fascinating still perhaps, as someone mentioned, was the sudden and unexplained appearance of The Ancients. Who were they? Where did they come from? Where did they fit into this? Apparently the explanation for that too contained too many character profiles and details that would have confused the unwashed masses. Better to just throw them into the mix and leave everybody guessing as to who they were and what they were doing there. I'm sure there were more, but it's been some time since I watched this. Talk amongst yourselves.Hopefully some day someone will try this again. Hopefully that person will have actually read the book and try to stick a little closer to the plotline.

Adapted from Anne Rice's novel of the same name, ""Queen"" is overstuffed, flashy, disjointed, and sure to offend Rice's die-hard fans.The Vampire Lestat is back. Only now Lestat (Stuart Townsend) has awakened and joined a nu-metal band, becoming a universally adored rock star -- and proclaims to the world that he wants vampires to not hide anymore. Needless to say, this proclaimation makes him hotter than ever among humans, but irks his fellow vampires no end.But his music is more than popular -- it somehow wakes the ancient Egyptian vampire Akasha (Aaliyah), who is the mother (or grandmother, or great-grandmother...) of all vampires. Akasha is incredibly powerful, able to walk out in the sun and burn her enemies alive. And she's besotted with Lestat -- except that he learns that she is more evil and destructive than he dreamed.Despite being described as a sequel to ""Interview With the Vampire,"" ""Queen"" is a whole different animal. Rather than a sumptuous Old-World look, there's a pyrotechnic MTV look that makes the whole movie look dated already. It certainly doesn't help that the filmmakers also cram in half of Rice's second novel as well as all of her third. It makes the movie feel like it's about to explode.Forget for a second about whether it was adapted faithfully or not. Instead, note that Scott Abbott's scripting is atrocious. Since Rice reportedly offered to do the script for free, it's a shame that they didn't take her offer -- surely she could've done better than ""Boo!"" ""Boo back!"". And fans of MTV-derived direction will love the handling of it, though director Michael Rymer tries to cover up his lack of talent with flash and fire.Stuart Townsend (also known as the man who was ALMOST Aragorn) simply bombs as Lestat. He lacks charm, sex appeal, presence and charisma in this role, as if he's overwhelmed by it. The late Aaliyah, on the other hand, has enormous presence even though she's required to basically bellydance her way through the film. Margaret Moreau is unimpressive as Talamasca groupie Jesse, although she fares better than Townsend.The second big-screen Anne Rice flick is a textbook example of how NOT to adapt a book -- flaccid characters, idiotic scripting and cheap direction.

In my opinion, it was not a good movie. Conversely, last night I went into seeing ""Queen of the Damned"" with a very cynical attitude. After ""Interview With a Vampire"" was done so well, how dare this completely different crew of upstarts even try to compete with the first movie? Well, I was pleasantly surprised. For awhile.What I thought was going to be a very cheap imitation turned out to be a serious attempt to capture the essence of the characters. I've read a lot of ""The Vampire Chronicles"" several times and the movie more or less got it right with them. I'll also say that Stuart Townsend is arguably a better Lestat than Tom Cruise. I liked the Tom Cruise performance, but when I watch that one I see Tom Cruise maybe trying a little to hard. Stuart Townsend seems to more naturally capture the vanity and arrogance of the character, while still communicating his reluctance to play the game by staying in the shadows.Even though this one takes a lot of liberties with the book(s), I didn't have that much of a problem with them. Once again, for awhile. Once you accept the fact that this is really a combining of the books ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""Queen of the Damned"", you have to expect that some compromises will be made. I did so for awhile, because these characters I knew fairly well from the literature world were acting exactly the way I expected them to act. This might bring problems to those not knowing the story, but it was fine with me.So I'm cruising along thinking four stars, or maybe even five stars if they can end it right, when all of a sudden, the movie is over. Now the problem of putting long books, plus their own ideas into a movie. The makers of the movie seemed to forget that the title of the movie is ""Queen of the Damned"", and should have featured the Queen a lot more. You don't get to see her much at all on the screen. Aaliyah does a decent job portraying the mad Akasha, and I wanted to see more of her.Also missing are the origin of the Queen, which the book went through great lengths to explain. This movie was doing such a good job that I could have easily absorbed another hour of not only her origins, but more about her plot of mass murder. But no, the marketers know that younger people are going to see it, and the attention span is only so long, so let's end the movie right now, even though were not ready to.Such a shame.

707914,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B000069I1B,Erica Anderson,"[30, 46]","Being a huge fan of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles series, I was dying to see ""Queen of the Damned"" despite initial reluctance of the idea of skipping the second book ""The Vampire Lestat"" in favor of ""The Queen of the Damned"". Still ""The Queen of the Damned"" (as in the novel) pretty much picks up where ""The Vampire Lestat"" leaves off and also covers a good deal of the second book too. Now that I have seen the movie, all I can say is what a load of *** was wasted to make this dud of a movie. Unfortunately the late Aaliyah's final role is in this dreadful film. Her character Akasha was reduced to stupid lines written by writers who can't write a single decent line in this entire film. Granted in ""Interview With the Vampire"", I thought Antonio Banderas was miscast as Armand (who in the series is only 17 years old). In ""Queen of the Damned"", everyone except for the character Jesse was miscast, especially the character David Talbot. In the book version, David is approximately in his 60s, not in his 40s. Another stupid flaw in this movie is that Marius DID NOT make Lestat. The vampire Magnus made Lestat. Marius did not have short brown hair, he had long, blonde hair. Where the hell was Louis, Lestat's long-suffering partner, Gabrielle, Lestat's mother, Armand, a Lestat associate, Santino, and Maharet's sister Mekare? There was no explaination to who the other vampires were at the end of the movie but I am guessing they were Eric, Khayman, Mael, and Pandora. Khayman and Pandora did not die in the book. The writing was awful. Who ever wrote the screenplay needs to be dragged out into the street and shot. None of that garbage in the movie happened in the book. Jesse never went into that vampire bar. Those two girls that Lestat preyed on in the beginning never occured, and certainly not that wretched scene with the gypsies after Marius made Lestat into a vampire. Oh heck! 99% of the movie never happened in the book. This movie should not have been titled ""Queen of the Damned"" because it does not follow the book faithfully. The acting is awful.

707915,AYMPVLWFKTAYE,B000069I1B,"Erin K. Darling ""naive cynic""","[1, 3]","It's been years since I've read _The Vampire Lestat_ or _Queen of the Damned_, so I remember only bits and pieces of detail from them.  This probably contributed greatly to my enjoyment of the film, because the screenwriters largely mangled the plot from both of those books, combining them into one movie. If I had looked forward to the actual QotD plotline, I would've been disappointed.Akasha actually has a relatively small role in the film, and Mekare is entirely absent. Maharet is alive and well in the Mojave Desert. Still, it all comes together, and focuses primarily upon Lestat, his transformation into a vampire, and his career as a rock star (his singing voice is Jonathan Davis, the lead singer from Korn, who is perfect for Lestat.)For those unfamiliar with Rice's books, Lestat is a bad boy, even by vampire standards; he likes to cause trouble, and lots of it. We learn why he has a hard time being a vampire, and what he yearns for most of all. In the first few moments of the film, he awakens from a 100-year nap to find an entirely different world - a world in which he can cope much better. He outs himself as a vampire to the whole world, becomes the biggest rock legend around, and begins giving away the secrets of the vampires living among humans. The other vampires are, needless to say, a bit peeved about this, and they come after him. There are several driving forces in the film - Lestat himself, the covens coming after him, Akasha's awakening and subsequent quest for a lover, and Marius, who in this film is Lestat's sire.While the last 20 minutes are somewhat less than gratifying, the rest of the movie is fairly sound and enjoyable. It felt shorter than it actually was, strangely enough. Large sections of the original plot are left out entirely or are incorrectly depicted, and if one were to focus on that point alone, one would probably not enjoy this movie at all. I went into it with the sole intent of just enjoying a movie that looked like it was very beautiful - and it was.Aesthetically, this film is top-notch. The costumes, make-up and special effects are wondefully done. The acting is very good, and the screenplay itself isn't bad, either. Aaliyah did a fine job as Akasha, and Stuart Townsend was a great Lestat - much, much better than Tom Cruise. The settings are appropriately dark and moody, filled with beautiful sets, sensual people, and a wonderful soundtrack, and there is an almost dreamlike quality to much of the film.The one problem I had with the film was that too much was cut out of it for a lot of details and characters to make a great deal of sense. When many of the ancients arrive on the scene, many questions hung in the air, chiefly &quot;ok, who *are* you guys, and why are you helping this person?!&quot; The DVD features many scenes that were cut, though, and includes notes on why the filmmakers removed them. Many of them help things come into focus more clearly, and it's unfortunate that they were deleted. Perhaps someday, an extended version will be released, reintegrating these scenes.Overall, it was a very enjoyable movie experience, and I think even Anne Rice fans will enjoy it, if they can look beyond the liberties taken with the storyline, and just try to enjoy a vampire movie that's better than most.",3,"On its own, pretty darned good.",1038182400,"11 25, 2002",2002,3294,"['been', 'years', ""'ve"", 'read', '_The', 'Vampire', 'Lestat_', '_Queen', 'Damned_', 'remember', 'only', 'bits', 'pieces', 'detail', 'probably', 'contributed', 'greatly', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'screenwriters', 'largely', 'mangled', 'plot', 'books', 'combining', 'one', 'movie', 'had', 'looked', 'forward', 'actual', 'QotD', 'plotline', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'disappointed.Akasha', 'actually', 'relatively', 'small', 'role', 'film', 'Mekare', 'entirely', 'absent', 'Maharet', 'alive', 'well', 'Mojave', 'Desert', 'Still', 'together', 'primarily', 'Lestat', 'transformation', 'vampire', 'career', 'rock', 'star', 'singing', 'voice', 'Jonathan', 'Davis', 'lead', 'singer', 'Korn', 'who', 'perfect', 'Lestat', 'unfamiliar', 'Rice', 'books', 'Lestat', 'bad', 'boy', 'even', 'vampire', 'standards', 'cause', 'trouble', 'lots', 'learn', 'why', 'hard', 'time', 'being', 'vampire', 'what', 'most', 'first', 'few', 'moments', 'film', '100-year', 'nap', 'find', 'entirely', 'different', 'world', 'world', 'can', 'cope', 'much', 'better', 'vampire', 'whole', 'world', 'biggest', 'rock', 'legend', 'giving', 'away', 'secrets', 'vampires', 'living', 'humans', 'other', 'vampires', 'are', 'needless', 'say', 'bit', 'peeved', 'come', 'are', 'several', 'driving', 'forces', 'film', 'Lestat', 'covens', 'coming', 'Akasha', 'awakening', 'subsequent', 'quest', 'lover', 'Marius', 'who', 'film', 'Lestat', 'sire.While', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'somewhat', 'less', 'gratifying', 'rest', 'movie', 'fairly', 'sound', 'enjoyable', 'felt', 'shorter', 'actually', 'was', 'strangely', 'enough', 'Large', 'sections', 'original', 'plot', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'entirely', 'are', 'incorrectly', 'depicted', 'one', 'were', 'focus', 'point', 'alone', 'one', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'went', 'sole', 'intent', 'just', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'looked', 'was', 'very', 'beautiful', 'was.Aesthetically', 'film', 'top-notch', 'costumes', 'make-up', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'wondefully', 'done', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', 'Aaliyah', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'Akasha', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'was', 'great', 'Lestat', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'settings', 'are', 'appropriately', 'dark', 'moody', 'filled', 'beautiful', 'sets', 'sensual', 'people', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'almost', 'dreamlike', 'quality', 'much', 'film.The', 'one', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'cut', 'lot', 'details', 'characters', 'make', 'great', 'deal', 'sense', 'When', 'many', 'ancients', 'arrive', 'scene', 'many', 'questions', 'hung', 'air', 'chiefly', 'quot', 'who', '*are*', 'guys', 'why', 'are', 'helping', 'person', 'quot', 'DVD', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'though', 'notes', 'why', 'filmmakers', 'removed', 'Many', 'help', 'things', 'come', 'focus', 'more', 'clearly', 'unfortunate', 'were', 'deleted', 'Perhaps', 'someday', 'extended', 'version', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'reintegrating', 'scenes.Overall', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'experience', 'think', 'even', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'can', 'look', 'liberties', 'taken', 'storyline', 'just', 'try', 'enjoy', 'vampire', 'movie', 'better', 'most']",N/A
707916,AZ1PS5SHWHE0U,B000069I1B,Erka16,"[0, 0]","Disappointed in this movie is an understatement. Save your money and wait until it comes out on cable. I saw this movie when it was first released in the theaters. And the only high point of the movie was the concert scene with the music pumping (and the music wasn't that good and certainly not to every one's taste). But since that I am a rocker and generally like that kind of music, it was all right. However, it is hard to believe that a 200 year old vampire would become a rock star. Not much follows the book, but this did. SurprizinglyAs for a plot? Well...good luck in finding one. Trying to combine two books into one movie that is under two hours was not a good idea. To properly do Queen of the Damned there is a need for character development of all the characters. There was no character developement for most of the ones (vampires) in the movie. The climax of the movie was not so climatic. If future movies of the Vampire Chronicles are made, I hope that they do a better job.Aayliah was a high point, as far as acting performances were concerned. She did and excellent portrayal of the Queen. However, very disappointed that the Queen was hardly in the movie. And I think that was the general consensus of the people that were in the movie theater with me.  As for Stuart Townsend as Lestat, not as good. Even though he was nice to look at, his performance of Lestat was not true to character. However, I do not think that this is reflective of his talent, but that of the screenwriter.  I think that the Tom Cruise version in Interview with the Vampire was a better performance in comparison.  Maybe because it was a better written part.While watching this movie I couldn't believe my eyes how much of it they got wrong. Did the screen writer and director even read Anne Rice's book?! I can understand creative freedom, but this is not creative whatsoever. I can't believe that Rice okayed this.Now if you haven't yet seen this movie and have not read the Vampire Chronicles by Rice...

She introduced me to her when I was 17 and, instead of starting at the beginning, I started with QOTD.  I REALLY loved this book, especially of the twins Maharet and Mekare and how they came to be as they are.  It was so beautiful, haunting and sad that I couldn't help but love the book!  That book alone interested me enough to voraciously read all the others in the series!(at the time, there was only Interview With The Vampire, The Vampire Lestat and The Tale Of The Body Thief) After seeing how beautifully haunting they made up Interview With The Vampire, I was very excited to hear they were making QOTD.  I had been forewarned that it was not going to be as faithful to the novel and I accepted that because to tell it perfectly would be to make it into a 10 hour movie.  Anne Rice so intricately weaves her characters and gives them flesh and depth to the point where you almost feel you know these people and you cannot help but feel their emotions because of it.  Several people, including my mother, told me NOT to see it after they had seen it themselves, but I felt it my duty since a: I am a fan of Anne Rices and b: I am a fan of the late Aaliyahs music.  I was appalled when I saw it..they massacred Annes' MASTERPIECE!!!  The only thing that saved the movie , in my eyes, was the wonderful music by Jonathan Davis(KORN), the song at the end by The Kidneythieves ""Before I'm Dead"" and the beautiful costumes..... most especially on Aaliyah .

I'll be quick because many other reviewers have already done the work of telling what is wrong with this film on the basis of relating it to the novel.  The story is almost completely changed, and by that I mean almost nothing from the novel translated over onto film with the intention of keeping everything concise and the story linear.  Some very deep and important parts from the novel are either changed dramatically or cut out completely, and that is where the movie fails.  In trying to see this movie because of the novel..don't.However, as a stand-alone movie to watch, without comparison to the novel and by suspending your disbelief, this movie isn't half bad.  The acting is okay and the characters themselves are believable enough.  A lot of people have said that Stuart Townsend ruined the character of Lestat; I disagree.  While Tom Cruise did indeed do an amazing job, Townsend didn't do half bad considering the rushed script he had to work with.  His only downfall is that he may have tried ""too hard"" to win the fans over with his portrayel and just didn't act naturally.The movie itself was shot very well.  It has a dark sort of ""music video"" quality about it, and the soundtrack adds so much as well.  The story itself is good (but seems rushed) and the action in the film is directly related to the story.  And of course, the late Aaliyah did do a very good job as the Queen herself.  Akasha was a cold-hearted character that felt little or no remorse, and Aaliyah does a good job at adding some depth to that person.Overall, I gave ths movie three stars because as I said, as a stand-alone film it really isn't half bad.  If you are trying to see the work of Anne Rice's novel in here, forget it.

707922,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B000069I1B,Get What We Give,"[0, 3]","I read ""Interview with the Vampire,"" ""The Vampire Lestat,"" and ""Queen of the Damned"" years ago.  Ann Rice's books were quite the rage at the time of their initial release.  She took such creative license with the vampire lore that she made it her own.  It was unique and fresh, at least ""Interview"" was.  After ""Interview,"" Rice seemed to be writing Harlequin Romance novels that simply supplanted vampires for real people.The film version of ""Interview with a Vampire"" was extremely true to the book and had a really good script, sets, and excellent actors - best of all - an excellent director.  The film's most controversial casting was Tom Cruise as Lestat, but let's face it, the movie belonged to Brad Pitt and that movie loved him and he was perfect for it.Hollywood skipped ""The Vampire Lestat"" and moved on to ""Queen of the Damned"" for some reason.  It should have left the rest of the ""Vampire Chronicles"" alone.  ""Interview..."" did the job quite nicely and to revisit the subject with other actors, writers, and director was a bad move.  The movie is no good.But why?  It is faithful to the book on some key levels, but not in others.  That's often to be expected.  But why is it so bad?Even when Anne Rice wrote this book, her ideas were already dated.  The idea that a vampire would be a rock star was old hat.  While not directly addressed as such, the film:  ""The Lost Boys"" all but made vampires rock stars - they certainly dressed and acted like them - in fact they were far more sinister than anything portrayed in this film.  Then there's the whole bevy of recent films (The Brotherhood, etc.) that those low budget studios have cranked out where the vampires are heavy on (homo)sexuality and good looks.  And finally, the whole subject of hip vampires has been completely (and much more effectively) addressed in the far more innovative and exciting television series:  ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""""Queen of the Damned"" is not really a horrible film if you think of it as made for television, but when you realize that this thing got tossed around Hollywood as one of the next BIG films, you'll be amazed at the poor quality involved.  The acting isn't bad and Stuart Townsend is a good choice for Lestat - but he's got that sort of generic ""hot boy"" look that so many of today's young actors have.  Aaliyah (no disrespect meant to the dead) is no actor.  She does her best, but her part was so poorly developed, we are not privy to the true intense evil that her character is to convey.Ultimately, I think I can expound on the reasons that ""Interview with the Vampire"" was a success and this film wasn't.  ""Interview"" had the aforementioned cast, script, and actors, but it also had something that recent vampire films hadn't had:  It was a period film.  Dracula was a Transylvanian count and our rememberences of him are set in the 1930's.  Movies about vampires up to the 1970's had always addressed vampires in a period manner.  Beyond the 1970's several vampire films moved the action to the present and in doing so made the stories more accessible to a younger audience bored with black and white films and what they viewed as antiquated films.  But everything that is old is new again and ""Interview with the Vampire"" moved the vampire film back to its ""historical"" roots and gave us a grand costume epic of vampiric scale.  ""Queen of the Damned"" chose only to address the present and only skirted the period aspects of the story (granted I always thought the idea of an Egyptian vampire was beyond silly and was bored to death with the plotline in the novels).  The trouble with ""Queen"" was that it was almost a Cliff's Notes version of the story actually written by Rice and the characters were so superficially written that it was impossible to know what was going on if you hadn't read the books.Why Anne Rice didn't kick up two times the fuss over this film that she did with ""Interview"" is beyond me.  This film shouldn't have been made, but if it had to be made, it should have been much better given all the built-in hype that it had and the budget it should have and did command.Don't bother watching this movie - just look forward to new episodes of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" for much better writing, acting, and directing.",1,Made for TV movie that somehow got to the big screen,1030579200,"08 29, 2002",2002,4260,"['read', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'Vampire', 'Lestat', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'years', 'ago', 'Ann', 'Rice', 'books', 'were', 'quite', 'rage', 'time', 'initial', 'release', 'took', 'such', 'creative', 'license', 'vampire', 'lore', 'made', 'own', 'was', 'unique', 'fresh', 'least', 'Interview', 'was', 'Interview', 'Rice', 'seemed', 'be', 'writing', 'Harlequin', 'Romance', 'novels', 'simply', 'supplanted', 'vampires', 'real', 'people.The', 'film', 'version', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'was', 'extremely', 'true', 'book', 'had', 'really', 'good', 'script', 'sets', 'excellent', 'actors', 'best', 'excellent', 'director', 'film', 'most', 'controversial', 'casting', 'was', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Lestat', 'let', 'face', 'movie', 'belonged', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'movie', 'loved', 'was', 'perfect', 'it.Hollywood', 'skipped', 'Vampire', 'Lestat', 'moved', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'reason', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'rest', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'alone', 'Interview', 'did', 'job', 'quite', 'nicely', 'revisit', 'subject', 'other', 'actors', 'writers', 'director', 'was', 'bad', 'move', 'movie', 'good.But', 'why', 'faithful', 'book', 'key', 'levels', 'not', 'others', 'often', 'be', 'expected', 'why', 'so', 'bad', 'Even', 'when', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'wrote', 'book', 'ideas', 'were', 'already', 'dated', 'idea', 'vampire', 'would', 'be', 'rock', 'star', 'was', 'old', 'hat', 'not', 'directly', 'addressed', 'such', 'film', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'made', 'vampires', 'rock', 'stars', 'certainly', 'dressed', 'acted', 'fact', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'sinister', 'anything', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Then', 'whole', 'bevy', 'recent', 'films', 'Brotherhood', 'etc', 'low', 'budget', 'studios', 'have', 'cranked', 'out', 'where', 'vampires', 'are', 'heavy', 'homo', 'sexuality', 'good', 'looks', 'finally', 'whole', 'subject', 'hip', 'vampires', 'been', 'completely', 'much', 'more', 'effectively', 'addressed', 'far', 'more', 'innovative', 'exciting', 'television', 'series', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'not', 'really', 'horrible', 'film', 'think', 'made', 'television', 'when', 'realize', 'thing', 'got', 'tossed', 'around', 'Hollywood', 'one', 'next', 'BIG', 'films', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amazed', 'poor', 'quality', 'involved', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'good', 'choice', 'Lestat', 'got', 'sort', 'generic', 'hot', 'boy', 'look', 'so', 'many', 'today', 'young', 'actors', 'have', 'Aaliyah', 'disrespect', 'meant', 'dead', 'actor', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'so', 'poorly', 'developed', 'are', 'not', 'privy', 'true', 'intense', 'evil', 'character', 'convey.Ultimately', 'think', 'can', 'expound', 'reasons', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'was', 'success', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'Interview', 'had', 'aforementioned', 'cast', 'script', 'actors', 'also', 'had', 'something', 'recent', 'vampire', 'films', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'was', 'period', 'film', 'Dracula', 'was', 'Transylvanian', 'count', 'rememberences', 'are', 'set', '1930', 'Movies', 'vampires', 'up', '1970', 'had', 'always', 'addressed', 'vampires', 'period', 'manner', '1970', 'several', 'vampire', 'films', 'moved', 'action', 'present', 'doing', 'so', 'made', 'stories', 'more', 'accessible', 'younger', 'audience', 'bored', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'what', 'viewed', 'antiquated', 'films', 'everything', 'old', 'new', 'again', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'moved', 'vampire', 'film', 'back', 'historical', 'roots', 'gave', 'grand', 'costume', 'epic', 'vampiric', 'scale', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'chose', 'only', 'address', 'present', 'only', 'skirted', 'period', 'aspects', 'story', 'granted', 'always', 'thought', 'idea', 'Egyptian', 'vampire', 'was', 'silly', 'was', 'bored', 'death', 'plotline', 'novels', 'trouble', 'Queen', 'was', 'was', 'almost', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'version', 'story', 'actually', 'written', 'Rice', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'superficially', 'written', 'was', 'impossible', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'books.Why', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'did', ""n't"", 'kick', 'up', 'two', 'times', 'fuss', 'film', 'did', 'Interview', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'made', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'given', 'built-in', 'hype', 'had', 'budget', 'should', 'have', 'did', 'command.Do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watching', 'movie', 'just', 'look', 'forward', 'new', 'episodes', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'much', 'better', 'writing', 'acting', 'directing']",N/A

And the term ""sold out"" or ""sell out"" can apply to this particular type of blatant irresponsibility. It was once understood that Anne Rice challenged the move to let Tom Cruise play her beloved Lestat; a move that proved to be an exceptional one. What happened this go-around?Stuart Townsend doesn't have the range, versatility, or skill of an accomplished actor like Cruise who redefines ""performance"" and ""believability"" to his characters. Cruise also has the perfectionism to study both the script and the book to set a foundation for the character. Townsend makes a mockery of Lestat from the very beginning and gives the feel of a ""Crow: City of Angels"" feel. Maybe he researched Vincent Perez's character, or he took some pointers from the supporting actor who plays Marius. Either way, the integrity of Lestat is destroyed. Aaliyah is another example of miscasting.While you sit through this movie, one tends to wonder whether Anne Rice has any creative control over her works.

I saw the previews, which were cool beyond belief! The scenes of the Queen had me half out of my seat every time I saw them!That being said, I was a little scared that Lestat didn't have blond hair, but I thought ""hey, who cares, it's still going to be great!"" Then in the theater, opening night, the first scene, my heart sank....first there was BAD ACTING... then came the BAD ADAPTATION... which tied in the BAD SCRIPT... and the BAD DIALOGUE.... and led to a just plain BAD MOVIE. When I say BAD, I mean HORRIBLE. This movie did no justice to the books, it did no justice to even a good storyline.If you like the books, save your money. If you like a good vampire flick, one that makes sense, save your money. If you like to watch a movie and leave the place in a good mood, save your money. But, if you like to be confused, upset, or just plain disgusted after two hours of squirming in your seat, this one's for you!Don't get me wrong, I loved to see Aaliyah in her final role. Her portrayal as the Queen was excellent. It was just not enough to carry the rest of the movie.I'll end by saying that I understand the excitement of the reviewers who had not yet seen the movie, since I felt the same only two days ago. However, now that I have been, I can only say that I haven't been this dissapointed since... well, I've never been this dissappointed.

It really combines the stories of The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned.The initial part of the movie is close to the story of Lestat, but it misses on a few minor items, such as his origin, how he met Marius, any mention of his mother, etc. However the character and the story in the first part of the movie feel true to the Lestat of the novel. The music strikes the tone you would have imagined by the words in the novel, and Townsend did a good job in setting the character.

Aaliyah is the best actor is the film playing the part of the evil Mother of all Vampires, Akasha. Aaliyah bless your soul and rest in peace forever. Stuart Townsend plays the wicked, devious, and sly vampire Lestat. Michael Rymer, the director, also does an amazing job with everything in the film.The DVD of Queen of the Damned is wonderful. The picture is crystal clear and the sound is amazing. The DVD features include: AALIYAH REMEMBERED and 2 other documentaries, commentary by the director, producer, and composer, 13 additional scenes, 3 full-length Lestat music videos, extended concert sequences, gag reel, production book stills gallery, cast film highlights, and a theatrical trailer. Overall the DVD is A++ work.Queen of the Damned follows Lestat into his acceptance in the tattooed and pierced world of being a gothic rock star. The movie goes deeper into how Lestat came to be through his journal found by a reseacher of the vampire who created Lestat. Lestat turns fellow vampires against him becuase he tells the world is a vampire and that vampires walk among humans. This angers the vampires because they do not want to be known by the humans. When Lestat awakens Akasha, the Mother of all Vampires, he is intoxicated by her and her powers.The film has a lot more to it than that. This film is definately worth the rent but for some(like me) the buy. Its a great film with great actors. Hope you enjoy the film.

So this isn't the best adaptation of the vampire chronicles it's still a very entertaining movie. Stuart Townsend is more Lestat than Tom Cruise was because Lestat is not in his thirties in the books he is late teens early twenties so Townsend fits. But it's just an adaptation. The books were very detailed and very well thought out Anne Rice is the most amazing author alive today but we only have less than two hours to make a movie. If they made The vampire chronicle the way they were written we'd have to make a lord of the rings type movie at best, Harry Potter, well I'll leave that alone. Aaliyah is amazing but the charater of Akasha does not look like that, I'm sorry but she doesn't. Making Marius Lestat sire was a good choice mainly because Magnus the creator from the vampire lestat was not in the story long enough to have a real effect. Where is my Gabrielle. My favorite character is Lestat's mother. She should have been in this one. Going back to my original point.

He has chosen to join a heavy-metal rock band, much to the astonishment of the band's unsuspecting members.  Lestat promises them world-wide fame, and he certainly delivers on his promise.  Soon, the band is being shown on MTV, Lestat is giving press conferences, and they are playing sold-out concerts all over the world.  Lestat also encourages other vampires to come out of hiding.  ""Come out, come out, wherever you are"" he tells them.  But instead of uniting them, he angers them, and now the other vampires are searching for Lestat.Lestat's music also awakens Egyptian vampire Akasha, who is one of the first vampires.  She is very powerful, is not afraid of sunlight, and can burn her enemies with a flick of her wrist.  She becomes infatuated with Lestat and chooses him to be her queen.  However, Lestat soon finds out that she is more evil and destructive than he can imagine.Lestat cares for Jesse (Margueritte Moreau).  Jesse is a mortal girl who's aunt is a vampire.  Jesse's aunt, realizing that she could not properly care for Jesse, gave her away at a young age.  Now Jesse, having come across Lestat's personal journal from the 1700's, decides to track him down.  She knows about how Lestat was created by Marius (Vincent Perez) and she is determined to find Lestat.I saw ""Interview With The Vampire"" several years ago, and I believe that it was a better film than this one.  For starters, I thought that the modern setting of this film was not as good as the first film's more gothic and older setting.  However, I believe that Stuart Townsend did a better job as Lestat than Tom Cruise did.  Having never read any of the vampire chronicles books, I cannot compare this movie to the novel.

Aaliyah you are my girl but man this movie wasn't working for me. I'd read some reviews of this adaptation of the Anne Rice novel written by professional movie critics, and they have been uniform in declaring this movie truly bad, deserving the equivalent of about a 1.2/5 rating. What is bad about this movie? There are numerous plot holes and faults here that render the movie somewhat difficult to understand for those who have not read the book.Some of the special affects and computer generated graphics were kind of cheesy and generic, and I thought there was too much of the same scene of Aaliyah, playing Akasha the god-like mother of all vampires, turning her enemies into a ball of flames. It's not a scary movie and won't keep anyone on the edge of their seats. As for the acting the uniform consensus is that Stuart Townsend is a talent less B-movie. Aaliyah, for the brief 17 minutes of exposure in this movie apparently looks stunning, but isn't much better of a thespian than Townsend but she gave more of a dramatic performance throughout the movie which made her my favorite character.Overall, when one mixes a bad plot, a lack of suspense and not so great acting, it's not surprising that the end result turn out this way. I must say that this movie goes by very fast to the point that I wanted to see more. But, that wasn't the case. Aaliyah, Queen Akasha, was only in a total of 5 scenes. Which isn't much, but Aaliyah did play and look the part.

For starters, i didnt pay attention to any of the diolouge and after  a while i got up and just left.  But about a year later, just recently, i found this movie laying around and decided to give it another try.  I really like it now.  The whole theme of the movie was very good becuase you really feel for Lestat and all of the other forsaken who must hide in the shadows. The characters are all strange in thier own ways and you can just tell that all of them are holding something.  The strange places at which this film was made also makes for that dark feeling that gets you in the mood, and the movie's odd soundtrack definately provided the final atmospheric touch to even everything out, with music ranging from heavy metal to that odd techno-goth such as in 'redeemer.'  The only complaint i have about this movie is the annoying trailing digital effects they used on all the vampires whenever they moved quickly or flew anywhere. It drove me crazy.  But thats a minor annoyance i guess.

This Lestat was more alive, vibrant,less brooding,believable and sexy. I followed the script without much trouble.Have heard that some viewers didn't understand the film. Well, I don't know how much education those individuals have.....And the criticism of Aaliyah's character/acting. There was nothing that I could see that merited any such criticism. Her character was that of a African Goddess, a queen who was the most powerful of her kind. She had a relationship with Lestat__Which might be the reason why many felt ""uncomfortable"" with this movie. The relationship was in context with the storyline therefore I felt nothing was out of line there. But if it makes anyone feel better, she was evil, betrayed by those she trusted and was destroyed at the end.But she will return again!!

707950,A1WX6R3Q4U37DQ,B000069I1B,"Joseph Morris ""Joe Morris""","[1, 1]","Not a very good film I deemMaybe its hard for me. I picked up the book of the Queen of the Damned day it came out at Bookends, after reserving a copyIt was a good book. Not as solid as Lestat, but a solid book, with enjoyable bits: of Armand being confounded by a telephone and an interesting story concerning some twinsBut this.. this is a mess. Firstly, the Queen of the Damned is the THIRD book in the series, after the Vampire Lestat, which is probably the best of the Anne Rice books in whats become known as the Vampire ChroniclesSo Interview with the Vampire, skipping to The Queen of the Damned (filmwise)?Now, the Queen of the Damned (the book) is all over the place, you've got several points of view, from Baby Janks to Jessica to the Vampire ArmandSo it was always gonna be difficult getting it translated to film. The Vampire Lestat (book 2) is a more straight forward tale, an adventure story starting in Paris about Lestat and his best friend Nicki (who Anne Rice did not like, but allowed Lestat to love).And it all goes downhill from there! (Lestat has a terrible time in Paris and has to abandon it to the Theatre of Vampires, which is encountered by Louis in the 1st book & movie (Interview with the Vampire)So thats where we are - you've got Louis' point of view in Interview (Khayman's humorous surmise of it: ""Behold the void""). Then Lestat comes along and his book (autobiography: TVL) is very much a reaction to Louis's tale (Khayman on The Vampire Lestat: ""This. And this. And this. And it means nothing"")Then Queen of the Damned, dealing with the fall out from Lestats concert (waking the Mother, the twins story, and a resolve of the situation, for good and evil)So what do you get in the movie? Well, nothing really. Marius is kept from The Vampire Lestat, but hes younger, and theres not the intimacy between the two men in the book, where Marius saves the younger mans life because he recognizes so much of Lestat in himself and the timing of his transformation (they both were born to the blood at the cusp of a new age). Here you really don't get too much of an idea of makes the two tick.You've got Lestat being a rock god, playing with Satans Night Out in San Francisco (nice touch to have him on the cover of Mojo magazine - that bit I DID like) - that bit was kept (the concert happens in books 2&3, and many characters go to it to find out whats what)But no Louis? no Gabrielle? Well, okay, I guess if this is The Queen of the Damned and you're gonna leave a bit out of the 2nd book, fine, but Louis & Gabrielle were pretty close to Lestat and helped you understand himAnd no Nicki too? which destroyed Lestat with his fate and sent him into the ground (to be revived by Marius, who then took him to Those Who Must Be Kept)I just don't get why Anne Rice didn't speak up and denounce this rubbish. I mean, I'm prejudiced, I really like the books.But this isn't really true to the books! I can get leaving Louis, Gabrielle. But no Armand? (no Armand?! WTF?! his relationship is crucial to Lestat, who even seeks him out later for help in TVL!)Theres not much on show here. You've got some vampires flying around at the concert, and GOD it just looks stupid! You've got the Queen of the Damned, but theres no depth there (no background on what makes her tick)And Jessica puts herself in harms way.. uh why? In the book she was never so foolish as to confront certain death; she did go to the concert against advice, but not deliberately into a dangerous situationJust a mess. Please: just read the book! The movie really doesn't add much to the ouevre and should be shunned like the plague. An appalling film.After this there were to be no other films featuring Lestat. Interview was a great film (it changed the book here and there - it was Louis's wife who had died, not his brother) but it got the essence of the book right (Louis telling off Armand on the end, noting his emptiness).The only thing this film has to do with the book is maybe it keeps a couple of the names from it!And its even rated lower than the Star Wars Holiday Special at Rotten Tomatoes..

I know she's supposed to be all evil, but the lie they sold us (Aaliyah's fans) was that she was in the movie for a long enough time that we would see her as evil Akasha and not wholesome Aaliyah. So that when it was time to kill Akasha, we wouldn't see it as Aaliyah dying.. that's some BS. besides the fact that damn Akasha sort of burns to death (you gotta see it my way), and that she's not even in the movie 45 minutes, I have to say disappointment is not even the word. My girl represented her role though. it was nice to see Aaliyah in that stretch of a role. far different from herself, or her other role in Romeo Must Die. She did an awesome job at being evil. The bar scene was bad-ass, don't front. But I just wish she was in the movie longer. I think the movie should have been called &quot;lestat's perrils&quot; or something other than Queen of the Damned. Why hint like the Queen would be there longer than 32 minutes? Normally when a movie is named after a person, that person is in the movie for much longer. It's a little shady on the part of Warner Brothers and Rymer and them.

707952,A2X2X8S80WW29I,B000069I1B,J. R. Cagle,"[0, 0]","Queen of The Damned for all its flaws is a surprisingly good movie. I enjoyed the movie right up through the concert scenes and if the movie had ended there it would have been a far greater success. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters seemed to have no idea on how to end the movie. The entrance of Akasha in the film although quite dramatic at first quickly fades due to a lack of character development. We never know Akasha's motives and reasons for wanting to pursue her goal of world domination and we never get to know any of the characters that show up at the concert. Maharet, Pandora, and Armand seem like nothing more than afterthoughts which is quite a disappointment considering how well they are developed in the novels. The whole movie seemed to go by too fast. It could have easily been given another half hour to forty-five minutes, which could have clarified the glaring holes with the plot. In the day of the DVD movie length should not be such a big concern. I say make longer movies if it means better explaining such rich and detailed books like Queen of the Damned or The Vampire Lestat. The set production was nice and lavish and the soundtrack was very appropriate and perfectly projected Lestat's rock star image from the novel. As for the performances I thought Townsend did a very good job at portraying the Lestat I read about in the second novel. He produced the perfect amount of bravado that Lestat is known for and it's clear that Stuart did his homework and took the role very seriously. As for Aaliyah's performance I thought it was very good despite a very poor script. She perfectly displayed Akasha's evil and sensuality with perfection. It's a shame that this was her last movie. One performance that was over emphasized was Natalie Moreau's performance as Jesse. Moreau played the part well but Jesse is given far more importance as a character in this movie and I honestly felt that the romance between her and Lestat was very cheesy and typical Hollywood B grade rubbish. Vincent Perez was hardly the Marius that I envisioned but he played the part well and I was surprisingly satisfied with his performance. Overall, I really feel that this movie has its moments and is fun to watch but is plagued by a poor script. They really should have made separate movies instead of combining both books. The movie could have easily been called the Vampire Lestat since his character is the dominant story when in reality Akasha should have been just as strong a presence in this movie. It's clear that this movie didn't get the first class treatment that its far better predecessor received and that's a shame.",3,A Good Movie Plauged By A Poor Script!,1015200000,"03 4, 2002",2002,2638,"['Queen', 'Damned', 'flaws', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'right', 'up', 'concert', 'scenes', 'movie', 'had', 'ended', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'greater', 'success', 'Unfortunately', 'scriptwriters', 'seemed', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'end', 'movie', 'entrance', 'Akasha', 'film', 'quite', 'dramatic', 'first', 'quickly', 'fades', 'due', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'never', 'know', 'Akasha', 'motives', 'reasons', 'wanting', 'pursue', 'goal', 'world', 'domination', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'show', 'up', 'concert', 'Maharet', 'Pandora', 'Armand', 'seem', 'nothing', 'more', 'afterthoughts', 'quite', 'disappointment', 'considering', 'how', 'well', 'are', 'developed', 'novels', 'whole', 'movie', 'seemed', 'go', 'too', 'fast', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'given', 'half', 'hour', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'clarified', 'glaring', 'holes', 'plot', 'day', 'DVD', 'movie', 'length', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'such', 'big', 'concern', 'say', 'make', 'longer', 'movies', 'better', 'explaining', 'such', 'rich', 'detailed', 'books', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'Vampire', 'Lestat', 'set', 'production', 'was', 'nice', 'lavish', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'very', 'appropriate', 'perfectly', 'projected', 'Lestat', 'rock', 'star', 'image', 'novel', 'performances', 'thought', 'Townsend', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'Lestat', 'read', 'second', 'novel', 'produced', 'perfect', 'amount', 'bravado', 'Lestat', 'known', 'clear', 'Stuart', 'did', 'homework', 'took', 'role', 'very', 'seriously', 'Aaliyah', 'performance', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'poor', 'script', 'perfectly', 'displayed', 'Akasha', 'evil', 'sensuality', 'perfection', 'shame', 'was', 'last', 'movie', 'One', 'performance', 'was', 'emphasized', 'was', 'Natalie', 'Moreau', 'performance', 'Jesse', 'Moreau', 'played', 'part', 'well', 'Jesse', 'given', 'far', 'more', 'importance', 'character', 'movie', 'honestly', 'felt', 'romance', 'Lestat', 'was', 'very', 'cheesy', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'B', 'grade', 'rubbish', 'Vincent', 'Perez', 'was', 'hardly', 'Marius', 'envisioned', 'played', 'part', 'well', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'satisfied', 'performance', 'Overall', 'really', 'feel', 'movie', 'moments', 'fun', 'watch', 'plagued', 'poor', 'script', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'separate', 'movies', 'instead', 'combining', 'books', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'called', 'Vampire', 'Lestat', 'character', 'dominant', 'story', 'when', 'reality', 'Akasha', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'strong', 'presence', 'movie', 'clear', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'class', 'treatment', 'far', 'better', 'predecessor', 'received', 'shame']",N/A

I know of only one film where they even remotely followed the book's plot so the fact that the Queen of the Dammed didn't even begin to follow the storyline of Anne's Rice's book should not surprise anyone in the whole wide world!Okay, with that cleared up I have to say I liked the film!  I liked all the actors; they were a credit to the roles they played with Stuart Townsend coming across very well as the tormented yet truculent vampire Lestat and David Talbot played by Paul McGann was really good as the man uneasy in the presence of vampires but drawn to them all the same.The Queen of the Damned is play by the late singer Aaliyah and I was surprised at how good she was, I wasn't expecting much but she did the role credit despite what other critics have said and I liked the idea of a Vampire becoming a rock superstar whose links to the Queen of the Damned are through his music and his drinking of her blood, a novel idea in my opinion.Akasha the Queen of the Damned is the mother of all Vampires, she knows no restraint, she will drink the world dry of mortal and immortal blood, she is sensual, she is a demon, she is blood lust all rolled into one violent and burning package and Lestat has awakened her and she wants to turn the world into her own little feast fest but she wants a King at her side and Lestat is going to be that King.Bring into the world of the Vampire and mortals Jesse played by the able actress Marguerite Moreau whose ties to the Vampire world is through an ancestor who before being made had born a child, and had watched over that child's descendents through the ages, add to that other Vampires, cruel, sensual, wicked, avaricious but occasionally compassionate and you have a heady tale of love, lust, desire, music and lashings of blood and pain.Good special effects, and a great sound track, all in all a great little horror flick that works well on the small screen!I quite liked the scene in the film when Jesse offers David immortality, she is now a Vampire herself and Lestat's consort but David hurriedly refuses, he likes his mortal ties.  However the Vampire Marius who made Lestat, played wonderfully by the delicious Vincent Perez has other ideas, Lestat is now with Jesse and Marius has his eye on David.  The film ends with Marius going into the library where David is alone and we know he is going to force David to become a Vampire!  A wonderfully ironic ending if there ever was one.My only regret is I didn't see this film on the big screen but it transfer to DVD quite well and it is a very enjoyable watch for those who love Vampire stories with more throat than gore.",5,"Rock Music, Vampires and the taste of Blood",1100736000,"11 18, 2004",2004,2738,"['are', 'very', 'critical', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'when', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'followed', 'plot', 'book', 'know', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'where', 'even', 'remotely', 'followed', 'book', 'plot', 'fact', 'Queen', 'Dammed', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'follow', 'storyline', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'book', 'should', 'not', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'whole', 'wide', 'world', 'Okay', 'cleared', 'up', 'have', 'say', 'liked', 'film', 'liked', 'actors', 'were', 'credit', 'roles', 'played', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'coming', 'very', 'well', 'tormented', 'yet', 'truculent', 'vampire', 'Lestat', 'David', 'Talbot', 'played', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'man', 'uneasy', 'presence', 'vampires', 'drawn', 'same.The', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'play', 'late', 'singer', 'Aaliyah', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'did', 'role', 'credit', 'what', 'other', 'critics', 'have', 'said', 'liked', 'idea', 'Vampire', 'becoming', 'rock', 'superstar', 'links', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'are', 'music', 'drinking', 'blood', 'novel', 'idea', 'opinion.Akasha', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'mother', 'Vampires', 'restraint', 'will', 'drink', 'world', 'dry', 'mortal', 'immortal', 'blood', 'sensual', 'demon', 'blood', 'lust', 'rolled', 'one', 'violent', 'burning', 'package', 'Lestat', 'awakened', 'turn', 'world', 'own', 'little', 'feast', 'fest', 'King', 'side', 'Lestat', 'going', 'be', 'King.Bring', 'world', 'Vampire', 'mortals', 'Jesse', 'played', 'able', 'actress', 'Marguerite', 'Moreau', 'ties', 'Vampire', 'world', 'ancestor', 'who', 'being', 'made', 'had', 'born', 'child', 'had', 'watched', 'child', 'descendents', 'ages', 'add', 'other', 'Vampires', 'cruel', 'sensual', 'wicked', 'avaricious', 'occasionally', 'compassionate', 'have', 'heady', 'tale', 'love', 'lust', 'desire', 'music', 'lashings', 'blood', 'pain.Good', 'special', 'effects', 'great', 'sound', 'track', 'great', 'little', 'horror', 'flick', 'well', 'small', 'screen', 'quite', 'liked', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'Jesse', 'David', 'immortality', 'now', 'Vampire', 'herself', 'Lestat', 'consort', 'David', 'hurriedly', 'mortal', 'ties', 'However', 'Vampire', 'Marius', 'who', 'made', 'Lestat', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'delicious', 'Vincent', 'Perez', 'other', 'ideas', 'Lestat', 'now', 'Jesse', 'Marius', 'eye', 'David', 'film', 'Marius', 'going', 'library', 'where', 'David', 'alone', 'know', 'going', 'force', 'David', 'become', 'Vampire', 'wonderfully', 'ironic', 'ending', 'ever', 'was', 'one.My', 'only', 'regret', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'big', 'screen', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'quite', 'well', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'who', 'love', 'Vampire', 'stories', 'more', 'throat', 'gore']",N/A

If you are a fan Anne Rice, and her beautifully written books then you don't need to see this movie in fact you'll be very disappointed if you do.  First it takes us from Interview with the Vampire and completely skips over The Vampire Lestat, which gives you a much better history of who and what Lestat is and his motivations in doing what he's supposed to be doing in this movie. This movie tries unsucessfully to give you history on Lestat while ignoring who The Queen of the Damned is.  The history on Lestat is completely differnt from the one in the books by the way.  And she comes off in this movie as a one dimentional villian, which if you've read the book is so far from what she was intended to be.  In the book you get a complete history of who Akahsa is.  The movie ignores her husband Enkil, and changes way too much of Lestat's history so that he is baerly reconginzable from the vampire in the Interview with a Vampire.  Aaliyah, and Stuart Townsend do the best they can with what they are given which isn't much.  Old favorites who are in the book are no where to be seen in this movie, such as Armand, or Louis.  We are never introduced to Lestat's mother Gabreille, or Mael, or Santano, or even Pandora.  The vempire Marius is completely unrecongzable from the book, and his history with Lestat is distorted and has been completely changed.  Who would believe Marius is supposed to have been a well educated, sophisticated, and noble Roman who was in his forties when he was made, and had long blonde hair. This movie is no where nearly as good as it could have been.  The time and effort taken to write and produce Interview with the Vampire is sorely lacking here.  Granted they didn't get everything right in that movie either, but at least they stayed within the heart of the book.  I'm sorry to say this movie doesn't do that.  Anne Rice's material deserved better and so did the late Aaliyah.

Bernabo,"[1, 1]","I know it is the lowest form of irony to complain that a movie about vampires has no life in it, but that is essentially my reaction to ""Queen of the Damned.""  It has been many years since I read Anne Rice's novel, but enough of it came back to me while watching this 2002 film to know what was going on, even if the film was going to be less than helpful in that regard.  Beyond that ""Queen of the Damned"" suffers on pretty much every point of comparison between it and 1994's  ""Interview with the Vampire.""The premise is that the vampire Lestat (now played by Stuart Townsend), was disenchanted by the world after the experiences covered in ""Interview,"" and took to his crypt for a couple of centuries.  However, the call of goth music brings him back to the real world where he produces to front a successful band and work all of the secrets of the vampires into the lyrics of his songs.  Meanwhile, Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), a researcher for a vampire study institute in London, has been studying those lyrics and starts tailing Lestat, who has reawakened the title character, Akasha (Aaliyah) with his violin playing, and, of course, upset all of the vampires in the world by betraying them to the world of the living.If you do not understand how all the vampires in the world are descended from Akasha, and what that blood relationship means for each generation of vampires, then you are going to miss out on a lot of the dramatic conflict in this film.  Fortunately, you are not really involved enough in the plot or the characters to particularly care as the film's sense of lethargy consumes the audience as well.  Townsend captures the arrogant aloofness of a goth music star, but neither the scripts nor the songs provide much help, while Aaliyah is simply too young for the title role.Ultimately, I am most disappointed by the music.  I manage to like the music of faux-groups in lots of movies, from ""Eddie and the Cruisers"" and ""Light of Day"" to ""Rock Star"" and ""A Mighty Wind.""  But the Nine Inch Nails style music Lestat sings in ""Queen of the Damned"" makes no more of a connection with me than the rest of the film.

This is not a B movie. I never heard of Stewart Townsend until I watched this movie. Also the guy who plays Marius is a star in France but no name in the US. Plot: Lestat gets bored with his vampire life because he is tired of being an immortal, he causes havoc by telling vampire secrets in his songs and becomes a rock star. This pisses off the rest of the vampires and they want to kill him. There is a story line of Librarians and Old Vampires but it makes no sense. Another storyline is Akasha. I really loved the characters of Akasha and Lestat, they slither and float across the screen. Townsend rocks as Lestat, much better than over the top terrible actor Cruise. In the novels, Lestat is sexualized, bisexual, chaos with fangs, and insatiable. Townsend's Lestat exemplifies all these traits. He is more than just eye candy.

707971,AFOK05KDCHSHL,B000069I1B,Libretio,"[3, 5]","QUEEN OF THE DAMNED(USA/Australia - 2002)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSWhereas INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE: THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES (1994) was undoubtedly a grade-A blockbuster - helmed by a red-hot director (Neil Jordan) and toplined by two of contemporary Hollywood's most bankable stars (Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise) - QUEEN OF THE DAMNED has the look and feel of a B-movie with delusions of grandeur. But what grandeur!Combining elements from two of Anne Rice's celebrated Vampire Chronicles ('The Vampire Lestat' and 'Queen of the Damned'), the movie finds Lestat (Stuart Townsend, ABOUT ADAM) rising from his grave at the end of the 20th century, where he adopts the mantle of a rock star and 'reveals' his vampirism to a disbelieving world, thereby luring other vampires out of their hiding places to destroy Lestat for placing them at risk of discovery. But his revelations also attract the attentions of a secret society - the Talamasca - which has been chronicling the supernatural for centuries, and an inquisitive Talamascan agent (Marguerite Moreau) is both entranced and horrified by what she finds. And then there's the Queen of the Damned herself (Aaliyah), who believes Lestat may be a formidable ally in her plot to conquer the world...Spanning several centuries and filmed with appropriate Gothic flair, the movie is anchored by Townsend's ultra-sexy turn as anti-hero Lestat. Flamboyant without ever seeming camp, he strikes a more dynamic figure than Tom Cruise's foppish blade in the previous film, and it's all too appropriate that Townsend's vampire should locate himself within the modern music industry, with its outlandish characters and overzealous visual style (several of Lestat's music videos - inspired by German expressionist cinema of the 1920's - are reproduced in their entirety in the supplemental section of this DVD, and they're convincing down to the last detail).In fact, the entire movie forsakes the introsepctive melancholy of its highbrow predecessor and plays instead like a Gothic MTV fantasy, losing a degree of emotional resonance in the process. During an audio commentary with several key personnel, director Michael Rymer (IN TOO DEEP) points out some of the changes he was forced to make in adapting Rice's work for the screen, though predictably, he doesn't address the homoerotic undercurrent which forms a significant part of the author's literary style. Nevertheless, the script - written by Scott Abbott (INTRODUCING DOROTHY DANDRIDGE) and Michael Petroni (THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS) - actively celebrates the 'outsider' lifestyle (vampires, Goths, rock fans, members of secret societies, etc.) and tips a knowing wink to the initiated when Lestat exhorts his fellow vampires to: ""Come out, come out, wherever you are!""As with the untimely death of River Phoenix during production of the first film, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED suffered a similar loss with the tragic death of co-star Aaliyah, a beautiful singer-actress who died in a plane crash shortly after completion of principal photography. Though her role is somewhat limited, she manages to steal some of Townsend's erotic thunder, and her final sequence includes one of the most visually stunning vampire disintegrations ever captured on film.

If she hadn't recommended it, I never would have rented it.  I'm glad I did; I really liked it.  Aaliyah was amazing as Akasha.  All I could think was that is was such a tragedy and a great loss for her to die when her career was just beginning.  She was amazing.  And I also thought it was pretty creepy that she died so soon after she played the queen of the undead . . . gives me chills.The story is good, and the captivating nightime cinematography pulls you into a world where vampires walk among humans.  The great soundtrack should send Goths rushing to the store in a frenzy.I do think the movie was too long.  I would have gone nuts sitting through it in a theater unless I had been forewarned about the length.  Parts of it are too slow-moving.  Stuart Townsend as Lestat did the best he could with the character, but unlike Interview With the Vampire, Lestat in &quot;Queen&quot; is written as a secondary character to Akasha, although he has much more screen time than she does.  But when Akasha comes on screen, she is mesmerizing, and it is worth the wait.

I should've written this review 4 yrs. ago, but I'm writing it now because I've recently purchased this dvd version. I saw this movie a day after it was released w/o reading the book and was left wanting more for some reason. I finally read the book and came to the conclusion that they made an absolute mess of what had the makings to be an excellent movie. I appreciated the restylization of the dirty ""biker"" vampires into the sleek, model types at the bar and very much appreciate the director for casting a black actress (and appropriately so...Aaliyah was perfect in the role) to portray an Egyptian queen, but that's about it. After listening to the director's comments in the DVD, it seems they eliminated/sacrificed scenes or parts from the book that had relevance; their excuses for eliminating such scenes for reasons of complexity, time compression and confusion only confuse those who read the book and fans of the Vampire Chronicles. There were so many mitakes made in this film in the name of ""time"". Maybe it was me, but I could hear the uncertainty and ""regret"" in their voices... If you watch the dvd with the comments you might undertand what I'm talking about. I came away with the impression that they were somehow pressed for time or just hodge-podged ideas when writing the screenplay; an absolute mess! Despite what everyone says, I liked their choice for Lestat and Stuart Townsend's sexy, seductive rendition of him...the French accent made the character more interesting.  I don't know why they even fathomed screwing things up with a ""love triangle"" of sorts between Akasha, him, and the ""vampire groupie"", Jesse. I thought that tag line was pretty cheap and clich&eacute;d. I guess it was done for the young viewers...If you read the book, I thought it was a shame they made the Jesse character into some weak, lovesick vampire groupie who obsessed over Lestat. Or maybe they should've cast a better actress for that part; there was absolutely no chemistry between Townsend and Moreau, whatsoever! It was most disappointing that Aaliyah wasn't given more screen time and better direction. The entire movie suffered because of its direction and awful screenplay...The soundtrack (and I'm not into ""goth"" or ""nu-metal"") is excellent, appropriate, and sets the mood for the film; very, very good job by Korn's Jonathan Davis as a ""novice"" soundtrack composer.Warner Bros.'s instinct to shelf this movie at first was the right choice.

Aaliyah was quite ok as a queen of the vampires, but what I liked the most, was Stuart Townsend's performance. He was a perfect Lestat. I believe that his performance made the movie as it was.

707982,A152C8GYY25HAH,B000069I1B,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","What you think of ""Queen of the Damned"" may depend on your opinion of author Anne Rice, two of whose ""Vampire Chronicles"" novels [""The Vampire Lestat"", ""Queen of the Damned""] are allegedly the basis for the movie. If you are a fan of Rice's work, then the movie is a travesty. If you aren't a fan, you might think it's no sillier then the books. If you've never read her or never heard of her, then it should be a treat - an inventive, if a bit cheesy, horror movie.Whatever your opinion, it's hard to argue that the film has much of anything to do with the books, outside of the fact that the main characters are vampires. It also has little in common with ""Interview With the Vampire"" [1994], the first movie based on a ""Vampire Chronicle"" book. That film, to me, was a grand, glorious, big budget, star-filled [Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas, Kirsten Dunst] Hollywood epic.""Queen of the Damned"" is a modest affair. The cast is not all that famous. The story omits most of the important elements and themes of the books. The special effects are obviously computer generated. The songs performed by Lestat and his rock group are surprisingly good and are one of the movie's highlights.The plot has to do with Lestat's waking up after a hundred year nap. He finds the modern world much to his liking. Tired of being anonymous, he starts his band, openly proclaims himself a vampire, and dares the other blood drinkers to come and get him. They do, of course. Among them is that damned queen, Akasha, an ancient Egyptian who is the mother of all vampires. She makes Mommie Dearest look like a saint. To make matters worse, Lestat is also pursued by a fanatical female mortal who's in love with him.Stuart Townsend is decent enough as Lestat. While his performance palls in comparison to Cruise's version, it should be noted that Townsend didn't have much material to work with. The late Aaliyah obviously had a blast playing Akasha; in fact, every time she and Townsend look at each other, they appear to be in danger of bursting out laughing.I AM an Anne Rice fan, so you can guess where I stand on this movie. I tell myself that she's just one in a long list of novelists whose books [or some of them] have been trashed on film. Still, if you can forget the movie's source, it will probably seem as good as most recent horror flicks.",3,Energetic horror film has little to do with Anne Rice,1031184000,"09 5, 2002",2002,2343,"['What', 'think', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'may', 'depend', 'opinion', 'author', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'two', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'novels', '[', 'Vampire', 'Lestat', 'Queen', 'Damned', ']', 'are', 'allegedly', 'basis', 'movie', 'are', 'fan', 'Rice', 'work', 'then', 'movie', 'travesty', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'might', 'think', 'sillier', 'then', 'books', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'never', 'heard', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'treat', 'inventive', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'movie.Whatever', 'opinion', 'hard', 'argue', 'film', 'much', 'anything', 'do', 'books', 'fact', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'vampires', 'also', 'little', 'common', 'Interview', 'Vampire', '[', '1994', ']', 'first', 'movie', 'based', 'Vampire', 'Chronicle', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'grand', 'glorious', 'big', 'budget', 'star-filled', '[', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', ']', 'Hollywood', 'epic', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'modest', 'affair', 'cast', 'not', 'famous', 'story', 'most', 'important', 'elements', 'themes', 'books', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'obviously', 'computer', 'generated', 'songs', 'performed', 'Lestat', 'rock', 'group', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'are', 'one', 'movie', 'highlights.The', 'plot', 'do', 'Lestat', 'waking', 'up', 'hundred', 'year', 'nap', 'modern', 'world', 'much', 'liking', 'Tired', 'being', 'anonymous', 'band', 'openly', 'vampire', 'other', 'blood', 'drinkers', 'come', 'get', 'do', 'course', 'damned', 'queen', 'Akasha', 'ancient', 'Egyptian', 'who', 'mother', 'vampires', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'look', 'saint', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Lestat', 'also', 'pursued', 'fanatical', 'female', 'mortal', 'who', 'love', 'him.Stuart', 'Townsend', 'decent', 'enough', 'Lestat', 'performance', 'palls', 'comparison', 'Cruise', 'version', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Townsend', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'material', 'work', 'late', 'Aaliyah', 'obviously', 'had', 'blast', 'playing', 'Akasha', 'fact', 'time', 'Townsend', 'look', 'other', 'appear', 'be', 'danger', 'bursting', 'out', 'laughing.I', 'AM', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'fan', 'can', 'guess', 'where', 'stand', 'movie', 'tell', 'just', 'one', 'long', 'list', 'novelists', 'books', '[', 'have', 'been', 'trashed', 'film', 'Still', 'can', 'forget', 'movie', 'source', 'will', 'probably', 'seem', 'as', 'good', 'most', 'recent', 'horror', 'flicks']",N/A

This movie is, if looked at as being separate from and unrelated (except for the most basic level of the plotline) to the book it shares a title with, is not half bad. It is genuine fun to watch (though some may want to turn down the volume when the music hits hard and heavy), and the actors involved all give relatively good performances. Unfortunately, it also seems quite rushed. I get the feeling that if it had taken its time and revealed the deeper past that is hinted at in places, it could have been much more (then again, that might have avoided the Bad News, seen below). Even the character that gave the movie it's title (Akasha) was skimmed over on a shallow level, which is a shame, as Aaliyah did a good job of bringing life to the Queen. As I suppose was fitting, Lestat's character was given more depth than the others, though even that was a little shallow. Stuart Townsend did a marvelous job of portraying Lestat, audacious and fearless to a fault.Now for the Bad News: This movie, though supposedly based on the works of Anne Rice, barely qualifies as being loosely based on her work. The first mistake made was combining two books into one movie (The Vampire Lestat, Queen of the Damned). Had each book been given it's own film, things might have gone better, and the movie might have been truer to the books.The other mistake was almost totally ignoring the books themselves. The character's were not as they were physically described in the books (though they got Armand right and other than not being blond, Townsend did well). The form of vampire created by Anne Rice was badly mangled, with the growth of power (and the powers themselves) with age being very out of whack, thus messing up the progression of power among the main characters: the young were too powerful and the Ancients not powerful enough. The vulnerability to sunlight was totally mishandled (even Akasha should have gone into a coma during the daylight hours). Also, the relationships between the characters were completely or mostly altered in the case of the main characters. The most glaring mistake in this regard is that Marius was not Lestat's maker. Totally ignored is the fact that as the first vampire, significant harm to Akasha could endanger the whole race. Instead, there is only a threat to the one who kills her. Nearly eliminated is the story of the Ancients. I hate to say this, but the people who scripted the film and made it either had not really read the books, did not understand what they read, or just did not care.",3,"There is Good News, and there is Bad News",1036800000,"11 9, 2002",2002,2567,"['Let', 'start', 'Good', 'news', 'movie', 'looked', 'being', 'separate', 'unrelated', 'most', 'basic', 'level', 'plotline', 'book', 'shares', 'title', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'genuine', 'fun', 'watch', 'may', 'want', 'turn', 'down', 'volume', 'when', 'music', 'hard', 'heavy', 'actors', 'involved', 'give', 'relatively', 'good', 'performances', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'quite', 'rushed', 'get', 'feeling', 'had', 'taken', 'time', 'revealed', 'deeper', 'hinted', 'places', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'then', 'again', 'might', 'have', 'avoided', 'Bad', 'News', 'seen', 'Even', 'character', 'gave', 'movie', 'title', 'Akasha', 'was', 'skimmed', 'shallow', 'level', 'shame', 'Aaliyah', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'life', 'Queen', 'suppose', 'was', 'fitting', 'Lestat', 'character', 'was', 'given', 'more', 'depth', 'others', 'though', 'even', 'was', 'little', 'shallow', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'did', 'marvelous', 'job', 'portraying', 'Lestat', 'audacious', 'fearless', 'fault.Now', 'Bad', 'News', 'movie', 'though', 'supposedly', 'based', 'works', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'barely', 'being', 'loosely', 'based', 'work', 'first', 'mistake', 'made', 'was', 'combining', 'two', 'books', 'one', 'movie', 'Vampire', 'Lestat', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'Had', 'book', 'been', 'given', 'own', 'film', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'better', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'truer', 'books.The', 'other', 'mistake', 'was', 'almost', 'totally', 'ignoring', 'books', 'character', 'were', 'not', 'were', 'physically', 'described', 'books', 'got', 'Armand', 'right', 'other', 'not', 'being', 'blond', 'Townsend', 'did', 'well', 'form', 'vampire', 'created', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'was', 'badly', 'mangled', 'growth', 'power', 'powers', 'age', 'being', 'very', 'whack', 'thus', 'messing', 'up', 'progression', 'power', 'main', 'characters', 'young', 'were', 'too', 'powerful', 'Ancients', 'not', 'powerful', 'enough', 'vulnerability', 'sunlight', 'was', 'totally', 'mishandled', 'even', 'Akasha', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'coma', 'daylight', 'hours', 'Also', 'relationships', 'characters', 'were', 'completely', 'mostly', 'altered', 'case', 'main', 'characters', 'most', 'glaring', 'mistake', 'regard', 'Marius', 'was', 'not', 'Lestat', 'maker', 'Totally', 'ignored', 'fact', 'first', 'vampire', 'significant', 'harm', 'Akasha', 'could', 'endanger', 'whole', 'race', 'Instead', 'only', 'threat', 'one', 'who', 'Nearly', 'eliminated', 'story', 'Ancients', 'hate', 'say', 'people', 'who', 'scripted', 'film', 'made', 'had', 'not', 'really', 'read', 'books', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'read', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'care']",N/A

Featuring a gorgeous cast, including Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah, beautiful costumes, and a good soundtrack, this film unfortunately ultimately fails to live up to expectations.As so many here have said, in the attempt by the filmakers to combine elements of several of the Vampire Chronicles novels into one film, they have butchered the story beyond all recognition.  Most tellingly, Anne Rice completely distanced herself from the project.  This said, I feel that we must take this film on its own as it is.  The story revolves around the awakening of the vampire Lestat from a century-long slumber when he is seduced by the alure of the music of a new age.  He sets himself up as a rock superstar and in his desire for fame and recognition, starts giving away vampire secrets in his song lyrics.  Thus his music has the double effect of not only enraging his fellow undead, but also awakening Akasha, the Queen of the Damned, the mother of all vampires herself, who comes looking for Lestat to crown as her new king.  Lestat and his music has also seduces Jesse Reeves, a beautiful young paranormal investigator who, as she delves deeper into the dark underworld, finds that being the living dead may not be all it's cracked up to be.  In the end, there is a final showdown between Akasha and the Ancients and ultimately Lestat finds redemption through his newfound love with Jesse and he is freed from his lingering guilt and the prison of immortality that he has long felt weighing on his soul.Queen of the Damned fails to really deliver the goods.  It comes across as a flashy, fashion soaked music video with tons of style but little real substance.  The script is disjointed and comes complete with clips of MTV News spouting cheesy lines like ""Goths have started arriving in Death Valley"" and a Talamascan rede that urges ""Observe the dark realm but be not of it"".  Annoying plot holes abound also.  For instance, who are the Ancients exactly and where did they come from?  Why is it after all this time that Marius comes back to defend Letstat?  Who are the Talamasca and what is their purpose?  These things are never explained.  None of the characters are really explored with any depth and thus we have no real involment with any of them.

He has no presence and does not come close to showing the power that this vampire has, nor the sense of loss in knowing he cannot be mortal again.  Townsend looks frail, and his emotional range is as wide as a bobby pin. Marguerite Moreau fares a little better in the role of Jessie, but playing opposite the limp Townsend, she'd look like Meryl Streep!  Vincent Perez is also ill cast as Marius, he too merely a mirror image of Townsend's Lestat.  Aaliyah is certainly a dynamic screen persona, but given so little to do, she merely dances and struts, with no emotional fulcrum.  Sadly to say, her untimely death robbed her of going on to bigger and much better things than this bomb!Far more entertaining is the gag reel on the special features, where more emotion and vitality is shown in three minutes than the whole 90 minutes of this miscue.If I were Anne Rice, I wouldn't sell any more of her rights unless she is more involved and gets a more talented cast and director.",2,WHO SUCKED THE BLOOD OUT OF THIS MOVIE?,1093392000,"08 25, 2004",2004,1544,"['Anne', 'Rice', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'tightly', 'wound', 'intricately', 'plotted', 'series', 'three', 'books', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'ala', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'take', 'third', 'entry', 'eschew', 'second', 'then', 'expect', 'audience', 'understand', 'pure', 'nonsense', 'many', 'elements', 'QUEEN', 'OF', 'THE', 'DAMNED', 'are', 'included', 'movie', 'little', 'sense', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'who', 'have', 'ridiculously', 'lame', 'First', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'absolutely', 'atrocious', 'Lestat', 'more', 'preening', 'rock', 'star', 'effeminate', 'hairstylist', 'presence', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'showing', 'power', 'vampire', 'sense', 'loss', 'knowing', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'mortal', 'again', 'Townsend', 'frail', 'emotional', 'range', 'as', 'wide', 'bobby', 'pin', 'Marguerite', 'Moreau', 'little', 'better', 'role', 'Jessie', 'playing', 'opposite', 'limp', 'Townsend', ""'d"", 'look', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Vincent', 'Perez', 'also', 'ill', 'cast', 'Marius', 'too', 'merely', 'mirror', 'image', 'Townsend', 'Lestat', 'Aaliyah', 'certainly', 'dynamic', 'screen', 'persona', 'given', 'so', 'little', 'do', 'merely', 'dances', 'struts', 'emotional', 'fulcrum', 'Sadly', 'say', 'untimely', 'death', 'robbed', 'going', 'bigger', 'much', 'better', 'things', 'bomb', 'Far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'gag', 'reel', 'special', 'features', 'where', 'more', 'emotion', 'vitality', 'shown', 'three', 'minutes', 'whole', '90', 'minutes', 'miscue.If', 'were', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'would', ""n't"", 'sell', 'more', 'rights', 'more', 'involved', 'more', 'talented', 'cast', 'director']",N/A

This had the potential of being a really good movie, but goes down underground faster than a vampire at daybreak. My biggest complainant was the non-existence of the ""Redhaired Twins"" storyline and the tie in with ""The Great Family."" It was such an important part of the book, that here gets no screen mention at all.  Akasha's death scene in the end is therefore anti-climatic for me and boring. Also you never get a strong sense in the movie of what Akasha's mission is for earth, which she makes a very strong arguement for in the book.  While The  DVD does pack a few nice extras- A tribute to Aaliyah, behind the scenes, the making of the music for the film (Lestat's band).  The ""Unseeen"" (deleted senes) offer a little more plot line, it is still not enough for any real fan to sink their teeth into.  Aaliyah rocks in her screen debut as Akasha,  It is sad because she did have great potentail as an actress that we will never see again.  Stuart Towsend does a worthy job as Lestat.

707992,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B000069I1B,Mike,"[3, 8]","""Queen of the Damned"" (2002)Queen of the Damned could well start a new genre: campire. This is a mix between a camp movie and a vampire film. While this films predecessor Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles took more insight into what it is to be a vampire and made the story very believable, Queen of the Damned is vamp camp that serves no real purpose except to entertain. This isn't going to change your life or win any Oscars, but you'll probably find yourself thoroughly entertained when it's over.The movie had lots of thorough good points: sound and sound editing, acting, direction, pace, chilling effects and heaps of cool settings. However, it received bad word of mouth and I don't really understand why. The movie clearly wasn't made to be the next Citizen Kane, and that's what I thought when I went into this film. I was thinking to myself that for sure the movie isn't going to be perfect or a next Citizen Kane on those grounds and it isn't. But it exceeded my expectations and turned out to be a fun flick.Queen of the Damned will make a lot of money due to Aaliyah's death. Her character isn't in the movie as much because she died tragically before the end of the shooting, but I really don't understand what everyone is whining about. We get enough of her. She is in the movie for over 30 minutes. Okay, we don't get as much insight into Akasha and we don't get as much of Aaliyah as some may have liked, but we get her in the middle and end, and that's how the story goes in the book. So why the whinging?Speaking of Aaliyah, I would just like commend the now deceased actress-singer for her excellent performance. She pulled it off like I never could've imagined. It turns out Aaliyah really studied into her character; her screen presence is terrific. She also has a fabulous vampire-esque accent, she preys and pounces very well and, my favourite personally, the way she moves as Akasha is breathtaking. From dancing sensually, flying and just plain walking every way that Aaliyah moves is arousing, erotic, scary and very monster-like. It is a shame such an extraordinary talent died at such a young age. Hell, if Aaliyah hadn't died we could be hanging out for her on Oscar night in years to come! Halle Berry did it, why not Aaliyah?As for her supporting actors, Stuart Townsend was also very good. His accent was a little irksome at times but I very much enjoyed his monologues and expressions. Margeurite Moreau looks like a cross between Frances O'Connor and Mira Sorvino and I really liked the way she acted. She isn't as spectacular as the two actresses I just mentioned but just quietly she has talent. Vincent Perez gives my second favourite performance of the film (2nd only to Aaliyah). He is perfect for the role of Marius and I would love to see him take more monster-like characters. I am not really sure why the heck Lena Olin was in here in the first place, but this role is just far too easy for her.The direction and editing of the movie is similar to The One, except it fits the atmosphere better. There is a lot of usage of slow motion and zoom shots, but unlike in The One, they aren't overstylised so much. It actually looks really cool the way the vampires blur through the air as they fly. The interesting special effects don't bring anything new but I enjoyed seeing some cool techniques used in the film.This movie won't disappoint horror gurus either. It has a heart being ripped out, beheadings, truckloads of blood and guts, and plenty of other things to satisfy all teenage guys. Speaking of teenage guys or any guy out there for that matter, Aaliyah is a doll to look at in this film. She wears very short and sexy costumes (done very appropriately by Moulin Rouge designer Angus Strathie) and shows off her body a lot. She gets to wear a lot of makeup too. Stuart Townsend is shirtless for at least a quarter of the movie for the ladies.I have mentioned nothing bad about this film yet. It is not by far perfect. It has its flaws. The script doesn't have enough meat to it, and neither do the characters. I would've liked to learn more about Akasha and less about Lestat in this movie. In Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles Lestat was developed to 3-dimensional and I would've liked to learn more about the title role. The romance story is pretty much just chucked into the movie without chemistry or development either. Also, the humans in the film sometimes do stupid things. Margeurite Moreau's character at one point goes into a bar infested with vampires who can probably smell whether she is one of them or not. And at the rock concert wouldn't the audience be starting to get a little freaked out when audience members suddenly go flying out of the ground and start fighting with the man on stage? Even if it was a concert where anything can happen, even I could've noticed that there was something fishy going on and better get out of the place, fast. The mortals barely move when a vampire is on them, when they should be running like heck. Also one thing that is reasonably common in all thrillers lately, the ending [stinks]! The ending for this movie just didn't do it for me. It was repetitive and the scriptwriters could've come up with something far more charismatic and original. Or could they?This movie turns out to be an above-average movie with a few flaws (some intentional) and a couple of silly turns. For all its mistakes though, the entertainment value remains. I guess the best way to sum up Queen of the Damned is that it is like an extended rock music video: extremely loud, slick, cheesy, flashy and yet still so fun you can't help but sing along.MY GRADE:

I really didn't have the time to see it in the theater. But now that I have seen it, let me just say that this is the best Anne Rice adaption that I've seen  since her first film adaption from her ""Vampire Chronicles"" series, ""Interview with the Vampire"" back in 1994! But, there is also another side to the film as well...and that is to remember the late, great songstress Aaliyah (""Romeo Must Die""), who died so tragically in that horrible plane crash after filming this movie. I think that she was either 22 or 23 when it happened. To me, ""Queen of the Damned"" is not really a sequel, but more of a continuation as to what happened at the end of ""Interview with the Vampire"" involving the vampire Lestat (who was played by superstar Tom Cruise at the time). ""Queen of the Damned"" focuses once again on Lestat (Now portrayed by Stuart Townsend, ""Shooting Fish""), who awakens after his 100-year slumber only to find himself among a new trend in the world...the world of rock music. And so, Lestat finds acceptance in a tattooed and pierced world by reinventing himself as a rock star. And Lestat becomes an overnight sensation around the world, etc. Meanwhile, his intoxicating Goth-riffed sound waves not only awakens the almighty Queen of the Vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), but his sound also rekindles Akasha's desires as well, which is simply...to rule once again! And to also have Lestat rule by her side as well! Unless an elite few can stop Akasha's reign, everyone, even vampires, in the whole world is doomed! In conclusion, ""Queen of the Damned"" is in the same scary and gothic spirit as any other horror flick that I've seen, but better! I now own the DVD version of the film which includes tons of extras such as a many number of featurettes (including a featurette that pays tribute to the beloved Aaliyah), 13 deleted scenes, 3 full-length Lestat music videos as they were performed in the film, extended Death Valley concert sequences, theatrical trailer, and DVD-ROM features. And also, in conclusion, this film has not only two great performances from both Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah, but also an excellent supporting cast including Marguerite Moreau (""Firestarter: Rekindled""), Vincent Perez (""The Crow: City of Angels""), and Lena Olin (""Romeo is Bleeding""), as well as an incredible storyline, and a great soundtrack to add!

When Interview with the Vampire (the movie) came out when I was in sixth grade, I was immediately hooked, and I devoured the original 4 Vampire Chronicle books one after the other. I fell in love with Lestat, I felt Louis' pain...it was wonderful. When I heard they were making a movie version of Queen of the Damned, I was glad, yet surprised, because The Vampire Lestat (book 2) is actually my favorite of the series, and I would have liked to have seen that as a movie. Now begins my rant.There's plenty of things I could say about this movie doing no justice to the feel and/or deep and layered plot of the book. However, since it is a movie and not the book, I'll try not to get that specific (i.e., Marius didn't make Lestat, but that doesn't make that much of a difference...does it?) What really [ticked] me off about this is that instead of taking one book's plot and trying to fully develop and explain the story, they shoved a bunch of [junk] into ninety minutes and made it loud, shiny, and polished. And let's not forget the kung fu.1) I loved Tom Cruise as Lestat, but...Stuart Townsend was hot. I'll admit it. He played the modern Lestat quite well, and I'm willing to say that his hair is *dark* blond. That doesn't quite make up for his brown eyes, however. :)2) Aaliyah. Not bad; she certainly looked pretty, but what was up with that stupid Hungarian accent? And she had basically no character development, which brings me to3) NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!! The only reason I recognized half of the ""ancients"" in the movie was by their costumes, because God forbid we should actually mention their names!!4) Why did we have to have that stupid ""romance"" [stuff]? Can't we just accept Lestat as being androgynous/bisexual and not give him a little teenybopper girlfriend?5) This wasn't even good as a plain old ""vampire"" movie. They used the same crap we've seen hundreds of times before. ""This is how you become a vampire. This is what you do as a vampire. I love you, but you're a mortal. No, I cannot bring you into my world. Well, now that you're dying, I guess I can."" And so on.6) The soundtrack is rather well done.So in closing, PLEASE, I implore you, do not base your like/dislike of the Vampire Chronicle BOOKS on seeing this one film.

I have never seen such a chopped up plot in my life!  Magnus made Lestat, not Marius! Jesse was portrayed as a lovesick waif, not a grad student.  The actual story did not make sense to me. There was just not enough depth in the storyline to satisfy me.  Aaliyah's performance (God bless & RIP!) was so-so, but her character was only in the last 30 minutes! Her sweet personality in real life came through in the acting so she was not as convincing as the evil, deadly Akasha.  Am I wrong, or wasn't her character supposed to be the MOTHER OF ALL VAMPIRES????  Why in the world didn't she put up a bigger fight when the other vampires ganged up on her?!?!??? Why did she make herself so vulnerable by offering Lestat blood in front of the other vamps???  Aw come on now...why was she so stupid?  Lestat was using her!  The movie was not as scary as the trailer made it out to be; it looked like one long MTV video.  Maybe it should have been marketed as a comedy! :-)Now for the good things....I think Stuart Townsend did a wonderful job portraying Lestat as a rock star...especially during the concert scenes & the bonus videos...the music is dark & brooding.  He did a great job portraying Lestat as an angry vampire tired of the prospect of being alone for eternity.  The fight scene where the vamps rush the stage, a little comic relief there as Lestat just lops off one vamp's head.  I did get a little laugh from Akasha's silly little rampage in the club & the way she just sashayed out the the club as it went up in flames. Vincent Perez did a wonderful job portraying the out of touch Marius.

It isn't in the same ballpark as the great Interview with a Vampire, but on its own it is worth it to watch.Among the problems it has is the lack of character development for all the main characters, including, to a lesser extent, Lestat. As that vampire re-awakens to become a rock star, we never get a real good sense of who he is, and why he's &quot;coming out of the coffin&quot; and revealing himself as a vampire to the world, a big no-no. But he's got more characterization than the queen of the damned herself, as well as his sort-of love interest, who wants to become a vampire.The pacing of the film also is off, I'm assuming because the plot is taken from a number of Anne Rice novels, not any one in particular. Though I never read them, I could feel the schizophrenia in the film and it made me wish they would have narrowed the plot down to one book.But despite these major flaws, there is still a good deal to appreciate. The world it takes place has the right, spooky atmosphere a good vampire film is supposed to possess, much of the cinematography is visually exciting, and the queen herself, when the rage takes her, is quite an exciting sight.Overall, this film has as many weakness as it does strengths, and it's unfortunate it's not better. But it's not as bad as many critics make it out to be.

Rice her self was not very optomistic about the production of Interview with the vampire when she heard that Cruise and Pitt were going to play the leads in the film. She was pretty unhappy about it. But once she saw the movie she was thrilled and felt it paid a reasonable tribute to her book. After all, when is a movie every bit as great as the book? It rarely happens. So lets suffice to say she had no major complaints, And it could have meant even greater classic films based on her books to come. But after the release of this near miss no studio wanted to touch another book by Anne Rice about vampires. This movie seems to have cursed the possibility. And while this movie isnt really all that bad there are numerous moments that nearly ruin it. One is the concert scene in Death Valley which while having some interesting special effects makes the film feel pretty goofy. Theres more stupidity after that, and even before. I still found that there were some really decent moments, and I liked in particular the scene where Lestat is playing the violin on the beach. The moment was pretty great, as were various other moments. But the movie doesnt follow Rices work much at all and nearly makes a mockery of the entire event. And honestly I prefered Cruise over Stuart Townsend who seemed cheesy in the role.

708026,AK1OBVI54SY73,B000069I1B,"Rocky ""Raquel""","[5, 7]","I have met up with a lot of cheesy fang thrillers and hated them. They always made vampires out to be jokes when I always considered them to be very serious creatures. Yet with Anne Rice's stories I thought no way they would ever do that to her material. I mean, look how well they did on Interview with the Vampire. It was done very beautifully and the actors themselves were strong and serious about their material and most importantly it was very faithful to the book with only one or two things changed, but nothing important enough for me to complain.Then Damned came out. I watched it, and at the end of the film I was lost for words. My friends knew how strong of a fan I was of Anne Rice and obviously knew how crappy the film was to a Rice fan. I was really just adding up all the mistakes in the film, and boy were there A LOT.Like, for one thing, why did they make it where Marius made Lestat? Why did they throw that in there? Just to speed up time, even though it is so wrong? They cut out a lot of the reunions the vampires made in Damned and that upset me.And let's reflect on the makeup and costume. Marius and Lestat are blondes people in the book. Even Tom Cruise knew that and made enough time to color his hair- would it really have killed them to color their hair? None of the actors looked anything like the characters except for Akasha herself.And I don't care what anyone says the man who played Lestat looked nothing like Lestat in the book and where was the Lestat charm? Tom Cruise played it as thick as honey and this other Lestat in Damned was so distant and dull. Akasha was overdramatic but I really don't have too many complaints about her she was actually all right, or a lot better than the others at least.Another thing, where were all the characters? Half of them were cut out. Including- gasp- the main essence of the whole story- the other red- haired twin who is actually supposed to kill Akasha. They totally cut out the vital part of the story about the sisters.Most assume I hate this movie just cause I'm a fan of the book but no it was also the way the movie was played out. The actors were dull and wooden and the movie in itself was turned into nothing but another cheesy vampire thriller with a bunch of fluff and no substance to be moved by. The actors themselves were cheesy. Honstly could they not afford better, more experienced actors like on Interview? Why couldn't they have paid more attention to the book like on Interview? Why couldn't this film have been like Interview, overall? I was really wishing for a whole series of films for Anne Rice's Chronicles, but if they are going to continue on making them as lame as this then I say just cut off all other filming plans.Anne complained when Interview was being filmed, but she should have saved her hostile words for the near future when Damned would come out.If you want cheesy teen fluff go on and watch Queen of the Damned. If you want a mature, in- depth and moving film on Anne Rice's actual vampires get Interview.

If you changed the character's names and the movie title you would have a decent vampire flick. Honestly, I don't hate Tom Cruise, but he doesn't really capture the sexuality of Lestat, more the attitude. Stuart Townsend captured the sexuality and the mysteriousness of Lestat perfectly. Also, the music in this movie is pretty great, thanks to Jonathan Davis, who really made Lestat's rock/metal sound... vampirific, I guess would be the word. Another note: The acting wasn't that bad. As far as everything else goes, the plot was pretty butchered, back stories were changed, and there was almost no character development at all.

I am a devoted fan, I've read all of her books, even her newest book, Blackwood Farm (which is definitely worth reading).  I have to say that if you've ever read her books, don't bother even seeing this movie, it's an abomination compared to what she actually wrote.  Now, I've talked to a few friends who saw the movie before reading the book and they said they really liked it.  Of course, they have since read the book and agree with me that the movie hardly did it justice.  The book was eloquently written, very indepth, with wonderful plot and character development.  The movie leaves many questions and most of the things that happen in the movie never even happen in the book.  Not to mention that they leave out key characters of the book.  A few of my favorite characters weren't even mentioned.  I was deeply disappointed by this movie.  I was hoping it would be like Interview With The Vampire.

The filmmakers cut out the entire Egyptian history with the Twins and the Family (except for one scene) and did not bother to name the important characters in the Mohave Desert (in Sonoma in the book).  Alayah was pretty hot; I did not know that she had died in a plane crash several months after filming.Lestat rises from the grave and decides to be a rock star.  The music was just OK if you're into the gothic heathen-type music.  Townsend was great as the under-toned Lestat.  He discovers Those Who Must Be Kept (I know that from the book -- not mentioned in the film!) and has a sip of blood and becomes a super vamp.As the film continues, it does not build much with the Lestat character's desires for ruling.  The Queen has him awaken with the sunlight, on an island of corpses.  No explanation.  In the book she had a hatred for Men and considered them the cause of evil.  Here in the film, she kills with no reason.Bottom Line:  A pretty good horror film.  The emphasis on the Talamasca and Jesse was ""OK"" but not really as inviting as in the book.  And without the addition of The Twins storyline, the Jesse part really does not make a lot of sense.What happened to New Orleans?Even Anne Rice was waffling on whether she liked the film or not (see Wikipedia).

I'm generally not a vampire fan which is one of the reasons why I put off watching this.  My advice... given the other reviews... don't watch this movie as if it were one of Anne Rice's books brought to movie. It's a disservice to all.As to the movie: I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I love the tension and chemistry between Lestat and Jesse. Very well done. I think  Townsend and the actress who played Jesse carried off their roles quite well.  As to Aliyah (forgive spelling) ..I really did not like her in the role of Akasha.I think it's interesting how the movie tried to bring together the coming out of vampires into the human race. A human race that appears to be enthralled and yet scared of the mix of the two beings. It turns out that some of the vampires feel the same way as well.  This brings an interesting moment to the concert scene. It's the moment that shows a human race of concert goers the violence and the passion of the vampires. Mind you... they were open about their violence.It is an interesting movie.

I even made her rent Interview with a Vampire but its not like she did not want to see Brad Pitt OMG he is hot.Any way we paid our $7.50 a piece for tickets (Really was not happy about the price but it was Ann Rice after all) got our $10.00 bucks worth of popcorn and pop.My first clue that this movie was going to suck should of been the millions of Goth wearing teenagers lol. But no I just fig that these kids were fans. I mean Ann can't just have 30 year old fans like me at the time lol( I'm only a little older now) I kept telling Kim while we waiting for the movie to start that the first movie was well done and pretty much stuck to the books story so this one should be just as good if not better.Oh if only I knew how wrong I was that faithful night. The movie did not stick even close to the book and the scence's were dark and gritty. And I'm sorry people Aaliyah sucked I can't even remember if she had lines. I'm sure she did but nothing that stands out to make her shine. Besides that dang dancing thing she did through the movie was getting on my last nerve. As for my beloved Lestant, please that kid and I do mean kid could not bring justice to Lestant.

708041,ABE14SVILZLNY,B000069I1B,"SID ""Punk""","[0, 0]","Combining The Vampire Lestat and the Queen of the Damned novels into one screenplay was, ahem, damned to suffer massive story cuts because of the intricate and detailed background of a dozen or so characters involved. The amount of detail always was the strength of the Vampire Chronicles, in my opinion, and they were certainly worth the read.That said, the question remains, without the detail and extra characters, can the basic story of Lestat's re-awakening of the Queen of all vampires be entertaining and sufficient enough to sustain itself? While I can not answer the question with a glowing appraisal, I will certainly admit that it did a decent job of combining all of the basic elements into a stand alone movie. The fact that this movie can stand on it's own without any ties to the prequel, Interview with the Vampire, is one of it's assets. You do not need any fore-knowledge of the characters, books, or prequel movie in order to watch this.Even though it fits into it's own little package does not mean it was packed very well. There were some plot holes, some of which could have been filled by simply restoring the &quot;Ancients&quot; scenes that were on the dvd. I understand, as the dvd points out, that they were left out because it introduced another subplot and characters that would add unnecessary confusion. While I agree with their reasoning, I do think they should have somehow salvaged the scene so that while the introductions of the ancients would have been left out, Maharet's few lines about Akasha's reign of destruction and the vampire's responsibility should have remained. They would have added a needed sense of urgency and motivation that would have made the final confrontation with Akasha and the ancients a bit more reasonable and satisfying.The character of Jessie is supposed to be the human link for the viewer to empathize through as they are taken into the world of vampires. In some scenes, this works adequately, but on the whole, Jessie's motivations, while they are explained, seem kind of empty. I am not sure if I can fault the actress or script, but when the movie was over, I still felt ambivalent about the character's experiences.There were other elements that were not as fleshed out as they could be. The paranormal Talamasca needed a bit more background about their vampire tracking as did the character of Maharet and her family tree. Like Jessie, they were given some explanation, but I think a couple more lines of dialogue would have helped.As I mentioned, the movie did a decent job of the basic story, but massive changes were made from the source material. Characters were dropped completely, or merged together, and huge sections of character history were removed. Most notably, Lestat's history is extremely compacted and revised. Nonetheless, there are some things that remained that I thought were done pretty well. The character of Lestat in this picture is rebellious and reckless which is more true to the character than he was portrayed in Interview. Lestat's re-awakening and concert scenes were exactly like I had envisioned when I originally read the book. The character of Akasha was also as I pictured and a very good casting choice.If you are a fan of the books, and you need the twins, Gabriel, Magnus, and crew, you are going to have difficulty sitting through this. If, on the other hand, you can set that aside and view this as a vampire movie of it's own, unrelated to the chronicles, you will probably enjoy this for the stand-alone vampire flick that it is.In summary, worth the rental",3,Queen of the Damned,1032825600,"09 24, 2002",2002,3574,"['Combining', 'Vampire', 'Lestat', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'novels', 'one', 'screenplay', 'was', 'ahem', 'damned', 'suffer', 'massive', 'story', 'cuts', 'intricate', 'detailed', 'background', 'dozen', 'so', 'characters', 'involved', 'amount', 'detail', 'always', 'was', 'strength', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'opinion', 'were', 'certainly', 'worth', 'read.That', 'said', 'question', 'detail', 'extra', 'characters', 'can', 'basic', 'story', 'Lestat', 're-awakening', 'Queen', 'vampires', 'be', 'entertaining', 'sufficient', 'enough', 'sustain', 'can', 'not', 'answer', 'question', 'glowing', 'appraisal', 'will', 'certainly', 'admit', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'combining', 'basic', 'elements', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'fact', 'movie', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'ties', 'prequel', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'one', 'assets', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'fore-knowledge', 'characters', 'books', 'prequel', 'movie', 'order', 'watch', 'this.Even', 'own', 'little', 'package', 'not', 'mean', 'was', 'packed', 'very', 'well', 'were', 'plot', 'holes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'filled', 'simply', 'restoring', 'quot', 'Ancients', 'quot', 'scenes', 'were', 'dvd', 'understand', 'dvd', 'points', 'out', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'introduced', 'subplot', 'characters', 'would', 'add', 'unnecessary', 'confusion', 'agree', 'reasoning', 'do', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'somehow', 'salvaged', 'scene', 'introductions', 'ancients', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'Maharet', 'few', 'lines', 'Akasha', 'reign', 'destruction', 'vampire', 'responsibility', 'should', 'have', 'remained', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'needed', 'sense', 'urgency', 'motivation', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Akasha', 'ancients', 'bit', 'more', 'reasonable', 'satisfying.The', 'character', 'Jessie', 'supposed', 'be', 'human', 'link', 'viewer', 'empathize', 'are', 'taken', 'world', 'vampires', 'scenes', 'adequately', 'whole', 'Jessie', 'motivations', 'are', 'explained', 'seem', 'kind', 'empty', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'fault', 'actress', 'script', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'felt', 'ambivalent', 'character', 'experiences.There', 'were', 'other', 'elements', 'were', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out', 'could', 'be', 'paranormal', 'Talamasca', 'needed', 'bit', 'more', 'background', 'vampire', 'tracking', 'did', 'character', 'Maharet', 'family', 'tree', 'Jessie', 'were', 'given', 'explanation', 'think', 'couple', 'more', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'would', 'have', 'helped.As', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'basic', 'story', 'massive', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'source', 'material', 'Characters', 'were', 'dropped', 'completely', 'merged', 'together', 'huge', 'sections', 'character', 'history', 'were', 'removed', 'Most', 'notably', 'Lestat', 'history', 'extremely', 'compacted', 'revised', 'Nonetheless', 'are', 'things', 'remained', 'thought', 'were', 'done', 'pretty', 'well', 'character', 'Lestat', 'picture', 'rebellious', 'reckless', 'more', 'true', 'character', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Interview', 'Lestat', 're-awakening', 'concert', 'scenes', 'were', 'exactly', 'had', 'envisioned', 'when', 'originally', 'read', 'book', 'character', 'Akasha', 'was', 'also', 'pictured', 'very', 'good', 'casting', 'choice.If', 'are', 'fan', 'books', 'need', 'twins', 'Gabriel', 'Magnus', 'crew', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'difficulty', 'sitting', 'other', 'hand', 'can', 'set', 'aside', 'view', 'vampire', 'movie', 'own', 'unrelated', 'chronicles', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'stand-alone', 'vampire', 'flick', 'summary', 'rental']",N/A

WOW such extremes of adulation and vituperation.Some people (including many professional film critics, judging from the imdb links) found Queen incoherent, hard to follow, hard to understand.Fuddie Duddies.  Were they even paying attention?  Its been decades since I read the books and my Korean girlfriend, who saw it with me, hadn't read them at all.  We had no trouble following plot, text, or subtext.  We were/are In Love.  And this is a pretty keen love story.Some people (many people; many Very Obsessive People) complained about the changes from the books.So what?  These novels weren't great works of art, they're potboilers.  Maybe good, entertaining potboilers, but potboilers nonetheless.Lestat &quot;was blonde.&quot;  No he wasn't.  He was typeface on paper.  In the movie he's brunette.  OK.  In the film of Crash, the Ballard's live in Toronto.  OK.  And Crash is SO much better literature than The Vampire Chronicles.Want incoherence?  Put in the story of the Twins, put in Magnus, put in all the other plot turns in the book and try to cut it down to a watchable film.  (First person who says &quot;They failed anyway&quot; gets sent to the princple's office.)Anne came close to real literature with Interview With a Vampire.  The prose was dense and descriptive.  Deeply sensual.  A legacy of her writing soft core?  Maybe, but that made it the only book of the series I really liked.  (I gave up after Tale of the Body Thief.)  From The Vampire Lestat on, there was less prose and more plot.  Lots of Things Happen.  One Damn Thing Right After Another.  Not quite to the annoying level of Stephen King, but getting there.  Literature isn't about plot.  I could claim it is about character, ideas, music with words, many things;  but certainly it is not about plot.Ironically, this particular density, this excess of plot - which bothered me from the beginning of The Vampire Lestat, but which didn't prevent me from making it through two additional volumes, so it must have been at least an effective plot - is what made the movie so much more difficult to make than Interview.So why was Interview so much more of a failure as a film?  Probably (aside from the resolutely Ghastly Casting) because Jordan tried for too much.Queen tried to be fun.  It was fun.  It made sense.  It was perfectly coherent if you were paying attention.  Maybe to Get the story you had to be In Love?  You almost certainly had to be alienated.  And if you aren't alienated in today's society, you aren't paying attention.  Case closed.It wasn't the books.  It didn't have to be.  It was fun.(And it had WONDERFUL music.  Which is probably why I liked it so much.  Oh well.)(Oh.  And Marguerite was pretty hot.

Aaliyah's Akasha was so wonderfully evil and decadent that for nights after watching QotD I found myself half-expecting her to leap out of the floor.

It's a tour de force, and whatever else one might think about Ms. Rice and her subsequent career, it makes for a truly entertaining read. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for this awful, AWFUL movie, which bears virtually no resemblance to the book in letter or spirit. When it's not downright annoying it's mind-numbingly boring and must rank as one of the worst vampire movies of the last 25 years. Gone are Rice's amazing stories of gods, men and vampires spanning 5,000 years of human civilation; gone the angst of otherness and the wisdom that comes with millenia. All replaced with MTV-ish glitz and shallow, clueless characters who look and sound like rejects from a second-rate video game.

Now I consider it fascinating for certain elements, and Stuart Townsend makes a great Lestat, sexy and charming, as well as the accent being more correct.  I love Tom Cruise, but Townsend seems more relaxed as Lestat.  The character of Akasha is almost impossible to play - like casting Helen of Troy, you can't please everyone.  But the actress gains a lot of sympathy for her death before film's release.  I found many elements of the film - including Akasha - to be more campy than dramatic.  The producer & director pay a lot of lip service to fans' complaints during their commentary track, basically making excuses for themselves, leading me to believe they really wanted to make their own vampire-is-modern-rock-star film but were stuck cashing in on the Anne Rice association.  For example, one of the biggest complaints about the Lestat in this film, that he preys upon groupies.  In the books he only preys upon evildoers (and he can read their minds to determine such).  The producer and director threw out Lestat's being able to read minds entirely, and say only that Lestat's morality is basically an inconvenience to them, so they choose not to believe in it.

The film is terrible.  It is very embarrassing to see Aaliyah in this way, and I cannot find the right word to describe my feelings.Not that Stuart Townsend as Lestat is bad.  He did a servicable job here, and he should not be blamed for not being Tom Cruise.  Production designs are modestly executed, and though Aalyah looks, I am afraid, somehow miscast (too young and too slender to be intimidating queen of vampire resurrected), she does her best to enliven her role.But its script!  There's no way to express my sorry feelings but to report my experience in theater.  A young twenty-something  Japanese guy (I watched the film in Japan) confessed after the show before his friends that he fell asleep, confused by the incongruous story.  Yes, the film sounds like an awfully tedious speech of invited guests in your friend's wedding party, which goes on and on like a snail, without making any point.  And the film also features the mind-numbing rock music with many Goth(ic) elements thrown into here and there.The film is about the vampires and a female researcher who is attracted by their underground world, and Aalyah's Egyptian vampire queen Akasha, but the whole work fails to concentrate our interest on one particular spot, going backward and forward in time and place, never knowing where to go.  The story as a result looks painfully repetitious.  What I am trying to say would be clear if you see the following summery of the film.-- Lestat rules the world (of the rock music mainly) and the heart of women -- Queen Akasha rules the heart (of Lestat) and the world (if possible) -- and Vincent Perez's Marius, Lestat's former master vampire, comes back to Lestat -- and many vampires try to kill off Lestat because the latter declared his identity before the press (however, the film doesn't make it clear whether humans take him seriously, another poor storytelling).  And there are other vampire clans lead by Lena Olin, who could or could not be Lestat's emeny.  See?

No pun intended. Just really bad acting.The whole script was poorly done, as if the creativity to convert the book to film just wasn't there or their hearts weren't in it.Aaliyah was very good, considering what she had to work with.Now, Ms. Rice is a born again Christian who disavows the occult work that helped make her rich and famous. No account for odd balls in this world, but it helps to be one when one is a multimillionaire for all that they now hold in regret. So we won't have anymore installments of the Lestat series, thank God. Literally. Not that the two installments thus far make that fact a real disappointment.Not even fan fiction on the Vamp. series or any Rice books exist on the net. Ms.Rice will sue anyone who dares. Though fan's writing can't promise to be any worse than the script that brought this dog to life.But if we did have a chance prior to the conversion, one would have hoped if this movie could have been done right that at least and besides a better script, Cruise would have signed on. Especially now that one of his most recent features, ""Rock of Ages"", demonstrates the man can actually sing.(Yes, that's him and not lip sync) As could Townsend of course. Though Cruise was much better at the vamp acting part, while Townsend did look like he was the walking dead. And that's without makeup. And did he diet for this part? Or did he have an eating disorder? Ick!

I can understand why most people are giving it crap reviews, and I'm pretty sure it's because of the script. If anyone has ever read the actual book, they would be stunned to find out how little of it there is in the film, and how many mistakes there are.There is nothing whatsoever to do with the twins or Mekare even, Pandora and Mael do not die in the book, Jesse never visits any vampire clubs or even flies with Lestat, there was nothing about a gypsie girl with the violin, and a lot of other stuff besides.Obviously they changed some things like the concert being in Death Valley instead of an old-fashioned concert hall because of the use of flamethrowers, as it is said on the dvd, and also the age of David Talbot for film reasons too. (I think it was because of the fact David was made into a vampire so they wouldn't have to cast someone else but I'm not sure.) Also, I thought that Aliyah (spelling?) was a bad choice as Queen Akasha, basically because she couldn't work the corny lines.However, all this doesn't make a bad film. Maybe even the re-invented script made the film altogether more fun, modern and glossy. I think the part of Jesse Reeves was perfectly cast in the form of the beautiful Marguerite Moreau. She is my favourite character in the film. And I'm sorry Stuart Townsend, but though you did a good job, no one beats Tom Cruise as Lestat.In case of any confusion as to who the vampires at the end were, they were Pandora, Armand, Khayman and Mael.The soundtrack also is one of the best movie soundtracks I've heard in a long time, so buy it, it's brilliant!",5,Not biased by bad reviews,1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,1669,"['personally', 'think', ""'Queen"", 'Damned', 'really', 'good', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'giving', 'crap', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'script', 'anyone', 'ever', 'read', 'actual', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'stunned', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'little', 'film', 'how', 'many', 'mistakes', 'are.There', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'twins', 'Mekare', 'even', 'Pandora', 'Mael', 'do', 'not', 'die', 'book', 'Jesse', 'never', 'vampire', 'clubs', 'even', 'flies', 'Lestat', 'was', 'nothing', 'gypsie', 'girl', 'violin', 'lot', 'other', 'stuff', 'besides.Obviously', 'changed', 'things', 'concert', 'being', 'Death', 'Valley', 'instead', 'old-fashioned', 'concert', 'hall', 'use', 'flamethrowers', 'said', 'dvd', 'also', 'age', 'David', 'Talbot', 'film', 'reasons', 'too', 'think', 'was', 'fact', 'David', 'was', 'made', 'vampire', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'cast', 'someone', 'else', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Also', 'thought', 'Aliyah', 'spelling', 'was', 'bad', 'choice', 'Queen', 'Akasha', 'basically', 'could', ""n't"", 'work', 'corny', 'lines.However', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'film', 'Maybe', 'even', 're-invented', 'script', 'made', 'film', 'altogether', 'more', 'fun', 'modern', 'glossy', 'think', 'part', 'Jesse', 'Reeves', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'form', 'beautiful', 'Marguerite', 'Moreau', 'favourite', 'character', 'film', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'one', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Lestat.In', 'case', 'confusion', 'who', 'vampires', 'end', 'were', 'were', 'Pandora', 'Armand', 'Khayman', 'Mael.The', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'soundtracks', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'long', 'time', 'so', 'buy', 'brilliant']",N/A

In fact, the clean lines of her feline, much-exposed self barely fit the jagged grunge of the rest of the movie.

708085,A386NTAR8ZSLVG,B000069I1B,"Wyluli ""Wyluli Wolf""","[2, 4]","I had never seen Queen of the Damned until last night, when I had just finished Anne Rice's novel Queen of the Damned.  Knowing I would soon be done with the novel, I was curious to see the movie so I went out to MovieStop and picked up a cheap, used dvd copy, despite hearing that this movie was very bad.  Turns out, the word bad is an understatement.Let me get to the point, there were several changes in the story, and I understand that some of this needs to be done in the movies for screen time reasons, etc.  But I found that after reading the novel, while the basic premise of the story is the same as in the novel, pretty much everything that gave the novel's plotline it's depth and intrigue was removed from the story in the film adaptation, and this movie simply falls flat.  I was shaking my head by the end of the movie with such disappointment that so much of the story was hacked away.  The vampires in this movie are not portrayed with the amount of love & feeling that is intended by Anne Rice, Akasha included.  Maharet, perhaps the foremost character in the novel, basically doesn't show up until the end of the movie simply to take part in a disappointing final showdown.  Again, all of the backstory that should have been present here was missing.I won't spoil it for any of those who still plan to read the novel, but Akasha's motives for what she was planning to do were actually logical (in her own evil and misguided way), but there was a reason for it that she saw as legitemate, where as in the movie it was simply ""everybody must die!"".  Period.  That's your motive for everything that the movie was building up to.  I can't stress this enough - the depth of the book is GONE in the movie.Like I said, I understand that things need to be trimmed/skipped for the sake of screen time, etc., but this movie was barely over 1 1/2 hours long, and so much of the plot development could still have been included here to give this movie the depth that it lacked.  What's wrong with adding even another 30-45 minutes of screen time to fill in the story and make it a 120 or 135 minute film?  Heck, I sat in the theatres for all three Lord of the Rings movies which all ran over 3 hours.  Or was this movie directed at punk kids with 10 minute attention spans, rather than the fans of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles?  Such a shame, because this movie really had the potential to equal, if not better, the adaptation of Interview With the Vampire.I could go on and on about the other things that were done in this movie that I thought were just stupid, silly, etc. etc.  Kind of like how the other vampires were pissed at Lestat for revealing himself to the world as a vampire and giving away vampiric secrets, yet they decide to fly up on stage during the middle of the concert, in front of tens of thousands of people and start fighting, in essence ""revealing"" themselves as well, which is totally inconsistent with why these vampires were angry in the first place.  I won't go into all of the details, because it would take too much writing to tell you everything that bugged me.Bottom line, I guess if you're into cheesy vampire action flicks with a Korn, etc. movie score, then you may still see some value here, but Anne Rice diehards will most certainly find this movie a waste of their time.  But don't let this movie scare you out of reading the novel, because the book is much much MUCH better than this movie.",1,Complete butchering of a good story,1166486400,"12 19, 2006",2006,3438,"['had', 'never', 'seen', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'last', 'night', 'when', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'novel', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'Knowing', 'would', 'soon', 'be', 'done', 'novel', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'movie', 'so', 'went', 'MovieStop', 'picked', 'up', 'cheap', 'used', 'dvd', 'copy', 'hearing', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'bad', 'out', 'word', 'bad', 'understatement.Let', 'get', 'point', 'were', 'several', 'changes', 'story', 'understand', 'be', 'done', 'movies', 'screen', 'time', 'reasons', 'etc', 'found', 'reading', 'novel', 'basic', 'premise', 'story', 'same', 'novel', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'gave', 'novel', 'plotline', 'depth', 'intrigue', 'was', 'removed', 'story', 'film', 'adaptation', 'movie', 'simply', 'flat', 'was', 'shaking', 'head', 'end', 'movie', 'such', 'disappointment', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'was', 'hacked', 'away', 'vampires', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'portrayed', 'amount', 'love', 'feeling', 'intended', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'Akasha', 'included', 'Maharet', 'perhaps', 'foremost', 'character', 'novel', 'basically', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'end', 'movie', 'simply', 'take', 'part', 'disappointing', 'final', 'showdown', 'Again', 'backstory', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'present', 'here', 'was', 'missing.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'who', 'still', 'plan', 'read', 'novel', 'Akasha', 'motives', 'what', 'was', 'planning', 'do', 'were', 'actually', 'logical', 'own', 'evil', 'misguided', 'way', 'there', 'was', 'reason', 'saw', 'legitemate', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'simply', 'everybody', 'must', 'die', 'Period', 'motive', 'everything', 'movie', 'was', 'building', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'enough', 'depth', 'book', 'GONE', 'movie.Like', 'said', 'understand', 'things', 'need', 'be', 'trimmed/skipped', 'sake', 'screen', 'time', 'etc.', 'movie', 'was', 'barely', '1', '1/2', 'hours', 'long', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'development', 'could', 'still', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'here', 'give', 'movie', 'depth', 'lacked', 'What', 'wrong', 'adding', 'even', '30-45', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'fill', 'story', 'make', '120', '135', 'minute', 'film', 'Heck', 'sat', 'theatres', 'three', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movies', 'ran', '3', 'hours', 'was', 'movie', 'directed', 'punk', 'kids', '10', 'minute', 'attention', 'spans', 'rather', 'fans', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'shame', 'movie', 'really', 'had', 'potential', 'equal', 'not', 'better', 'adaptation', 'Interview', 'Vampire.I', 'could', 'go', 'other', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'movie', 'thought', 'were', 'just', 'stupid', 'silly', 'etc', 'etc', 'Kind', 'how', 'other', 'vampires', 'were', 'pissed', 'Lestat', 'revealing', 'world', 'vampire', 'giving', 'away', 'vampiric', 'secrets', 'yet', 'decide', 'fly', 'up', 'stage', 'middle', 'concert', 'front', 'tens', 'thousands', 'people', 'start', 'fighting', 'essence', 'revealing', 'as', 'well', 'totally', 'inconsistent', 'why', 'vampires', 'were', 'angry', 'first', 'place', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'would', 'take', 'too', 'much', 'writing', 'tell', 'everything', 'bugged', 'me.Bottom', 'line', 'guess', ""'re"", 'cheesy', 'vampire', 'action', 'flicks', 'Korn', 'etc', 'movie', 'score', 'then', 'may', 'still', 'see', 'value', 'here', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'diehards', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'find', 'movie', 'waste', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'movie', 'scare', 'reading', 'novel', 'book', 'much', 'much', 'MUCH', 'better', 'movie']",N/A
