1186001,A2ARIZAVTCB6TM,B001EL6ECM,Austin114,"[17, 18]","Unlike a previous reviewer, I wasn't looking for a perfect, unedited collection. The fact that the three TV movies that ended the series are included only enhances this collection.Who has time to watch NINE seasons of unedited episodes? If you're going to pay good money for that, at least buy the remastered, enhanced F/X ""Star Trek HD"" series or something similar.These are the episodes I grew up with, and I enjoy watching them over and over again. My all-time favorite episode is the first season ""Survival"", which deals with bigotry and an unexpected blizzard.As for packaging, this is quite possibly the most EFFECTIVE presentation I have ever seen in a large DVD collection. Two small magnets hold a sturdy book together, and it opens up into an actual ringed binder. Each ""page"" in the binder holds 3 DVDs on one side, and a description of their contents on the other.In terms of presentation, ease of DVD use, and description of the contents of each, this is easily the BEST setup for a collection (and long-term storage) I have EVER seen. Usually DVD packaging is pretty flimsy, but NOT in this case!This is an excellent purchase, especially if you can get it at a deep discount!",5,"An impressive, comprehensive collection!!",1231286400,"01 7, 2009",2009,1189,"['previous', 'reviewer', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'perfect', 'unedited', 'collection', 'fact', 'three', 'TV', 'movies', 'ended', 'series', 'are', 'included', 'only', 'collection.Who', 'time', 'watch', 'NINE', 'seasons', 'unedited', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'going', 'pay', 'good', 'money', 'least', 'buy', 'remastered', 'enhanced', 'F/X', 'Star', 'Trek', 'HD', 'series', 'something', 'similar.These', 'are', 'episodes', 'grew', 'up', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'Survival', 'bigotry', 'unexpected', 'blizzard.As', 'packaging', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'EFFECTIVE', 'presentation', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'large', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Two', 'small', 'magnets', 'hold', 'sturdy', 'book', 'together', 'up', 'actual', 'ringed', 'binder', 'page', 'binder', '3', 'DVDs', 'one', 'side', 'description', 'contents', 'other.In', 'terms', 'presentation', 'ease', 'DVD', 'use', 'description', 'contents', 'easily', 'BEST', 'setup', 'collection', 'long-term', 'storage', 'have', 'EVER', 'seen', 'Usually', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'pretty', 'flimsy', 'NOT', 'case', 'excellent', 'purchase', 'especially', 'can', 'get', 'deep', 'discount']",Little House on the Prairie: The Complete Television Series

1186005,A2GZJL558B3TPC,B001EL6ECM,"D. Snow ""Debra""","[6, 6]",I never purchased the complete series together but I do own all episodes of Little House on the Prairie on DVD.  Most I purchased through Amazon.  I want to say I bought them so I could watch them when I wanted and didn't have to wait for it to come on television.  I am disappointed that some of the scenes are cut.  How do I know because I grew up watching the show.  I thought when you purchased a show on DVD that the entire episode(s) were there.  I continued purchasing them anyway because there is so little to watch and like I said I wanted an episode to be available when I wanted to watch it.  There seems to be so little to watch on TV anymore.  Believe it or not if they reproduced the show on dvd again without any cut scenes I would probably purchase them again.

1186006,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B001EL6ECM,JGC,"[18, 30]","""Little House on the Prairie"" premiered in 1974 as a movie (sometimes called the ""pilot movie"" or the ""premiere movie""). The series then ran for a total of 8 full seasons, from 1974 until 1982, and an extra season (the 9th) from 1982 until 1983 by the title ""Little House: A New Beginning."" It concluded with 3 TV movies during 1983-1984 (these are sometimes called ""season 10"" and have since been repackaged as part of the ""Little House: A New Beginning"" series). During the run of the series there were many extended eps that ran as 2-partners or double long programs and some shows that were 90 minutes in length. There was also a Thanksgiving retrospective special movie titled ""The Little House Years"" from 1979 (although this is not part of season 6, this 3-part program thas been broken up into 3 eps and in syndication it pops up in this season, although it is not included on the DVDs).Michael Landon (may he rest in peace) was the star, executive producer, director and in some cases even writer of LHOTP. As Charles Ingalls he was also the voice of compassion and the voice of forgiveness and redemption. I can't think of another TV character that is more loved and more known for being a good man and a good father than Charles Ingalls and that's because of Michael Landon. Michael Landon gave life to a man that most of us never knew before. He gave him a heart. But most of all, Michael Landon's best work was done in the back of the house, not on camera. Because he wasn't some big-shot who needed to be seen and who needed to be some big star, he was just happy producing quality television. And that's really the cusp of LHOTP: quality. Because of Mr. Landon, the series resonates with just about everyone. I cannot think of another person who is or was ever able to accomplish such a behemoth task. He set a standard of excellence that no one has ever been able to match, before or since.What I loved the most about Charles Ingalls was that he was just a regular man. He didn't have any super powers, he didn't fly through the air, he wasn't rich and he wasn't worldly. But you know what? That didn't matter because Michael Landon gave him such a warm spirit. Perhaps this was the first time on TV that it was OK for a man to cry because Charles Ingalls was very sensitive. For kids to see this was exceptional because it told them that it was OK to share their feelings and it was fine to be afraid. I am reminded of a statement from the series (Fight Team Fight!/Season 7), ""hurting someone doesn't make you a man, it's learning to love them.""But that doesn't mean that Charles was a pushover in the slightest bit. He had a nice right-hook, especially concerning the well-being of his family. I love the time when Charles went up against those 2 men who made a lewd comment about Mary (""that's a mighty good looking blind girl you got"") and Charles beat them silly. Like Mr. Kenny Rogers said, ""sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man.""Over the years the cast changed rapidly and readily, but that didn't matter to the viewers. Because even though Michael Landon wasn't on every ep, he could still be heard. His voice came though loud and clear. These are some of the main cast of characters on LHOTP during its entire run:Michael Landon / Charles Ingalls (pilot movie, seasons 1-8, season 9 2 eps and in 2 of the final TV movies)Alison Arngrim / Nellie Oleson (seasons 1-7, 1 ep during season 8 and in 1 of the final TV movies, playing a different role)Karen Grassle / Caroline Ingalls (pilot movie, seasons 1-8 and in 1 of the final TV movies)Victor French / Mr. Edwards (pilot movie, seasons 1-3, recurring briefly in some seasons afterward, season 9 and in some of the final TV movies)Melissa Sue Anderson / Mary Ingalls (pilot movie, seasons 1-7 and season 8 2 eps)Merlin Olsen / Jonathan Garvey (seasons 4-8 recurring)Matthew Laborteaux / Albert Ingalls (in 1 ep during seasons 2 & 4, season 5 recurring, seasons 6-8, season 9 1 ep and in 1 of the TV movies)Karl Swenson / Lars (seasons 1-4 recurring and in 1 ep during season 5)Hersha Parady / Alice Garvey (seasons 4-6 recurring)Ketty Lester / Hester-Sue Terhune (seasons 5-9 recurring and in some of the final TV movies)Shannen Doherty / Jenny Wilder (season 9 and in some of the final TV movies)Ruth Foster / Miss Melinda Foster (pilot movie-uncredited role, seasons 1-9 recurring)Katherine MacGregor / Mrs. Harriet Oleson (seasons 1-9 recurring)Richard Bull / Nelsen Oleson (seasons 1-9 recurring and in the final TV movies)Jonathan Gilbert / Willie Oleson (seasons 1-9 recurring and in the final TV movies)Kevin Hagen / Dr. Hiram Baker (seasons 1-9 recurring and in the final TV movies)Dabbs Greer / Reverend Alden (seasons 1-9 recurring and in the final TV movies)Lindsay & Sydney Greenbush / Caroline Ingalls (pilot movie and seasons 1-8)Wendi and Brenda Turnbaugh / Grace Ingalls (seasons 4-8 recurring)Melissa Gilbert / Laura Ingalls (pilot movie, seasons 1-9 and in the final 3 TV movies)As someone who has grown up watching LHOTP I can tell you with all honesty and certainty that every single ep is excellent because each one has a value all its own. There is a lesson to each and every episode of LHOTP but it's never hokey or preachy and it's always different. However the one message that I always got out of the series was to have compassion. And, perhaps the second most learned lesson that I took from the series was to have trust because in the end we are all in essence good people.These are some of my very favorite eps of ""Little House on the Prairie"":If I Should Wake Before I Die (season 1)With the help of Charles and Caroline, Miss Amy brings her entire family together to celebrate her life.The Lord is My Shepherd (season 1/2-part ep)Mr. Ernest Borgnine appears as Jonathan, an old man who helps Laura appreciate what she has when it seems that all is lost.The Richest Man In Walnut Grove (season 2)The family all pulls together when the mill closes and Charles has a heavy loan at the Mercantile.Remember Me (season 2/2-part ep)Mr. Edwards and Grace Snyder decide to take in 3 orphans after their mother passes away.The Talking Machine (season 2)Nellie is as mean-spirited as ever when she gets Laura to spill the beans about a boy in school, and gets it all on her brand-new ""talking machine.""Troublemaker (season 2)All isn't copasetic when an abusive new teacher takes over for Miss Beadle.The Long Road Home (season 2)Charles and Mr. Edwards take a job transporting explosives and as usual make some new friends along their journey.The Collection (season 3)Mr. Johnny Cash (may he rest in peace) stars as a preacher man, who, with the help of Mary sees the error of his ways.The Bully Boys (season 3)The Reverend learns that sometimes the devil walks the earth and some people do not want redemption.Blizzard (season 3)When Miss Beadle lets the class out early for Christmas vacation there is panic when a blizzard comes through Walnut Grove.Injun Kid (season 3)A woman comes back to her father's home after she is widowed with a teenage son. However her father doesn't take to her life choices because of the fact that her son is Native American.The Music Box (season 3)Nellie taunts a child who stutters then blackmails Laura into joining her ""secret club.""Gold Country (season 3/2-part ep)Charles and Mr. Edwards take their families into ""gold country.""The Handyman (season 4)Mary gives Nellie a nice clock in the face for insinuating that there is some kind of ""monkey business going on when the cat's away.""Here Come The Brides (season 4)In a rare ep, Nellie shows her kind and sensitive side.Whisper Country (season 4)Mary is shunned when Rachel Peal spreads vicious lies about her; branding her a ""jezebel"" and ruining a teaching engagement. With the blessing of her father, she confronts Miss Peal at a prayer meeting and finds out the truth to her scorn.As Long As We're Together part 1 (season 5)In Winoka the Ingalls family discovers that they're not in Kansas anymore.As Long As We're Together part 2 (season 5)I love how Charles immediately takes to Albert and doesn't judge him for stealing and even invites him to Mary's party.Harriet's Happenings (season 5)With the help of her cousin, Harriet starts writing hateful rumors; passing it off as ""news.""Blind Journey part 1 (season 5)Nels informs Nellie that even the devil can quote the scriptures when Harriet tries to keep Joe Kagen out of the congregation because he isn't white.Blind Journey part 5 (season 5)Harriet learns to be more accepting of others after a long journey with Charles and Joe, bring the blind school to Walnut Grove.The Cheaters (season 5)In a rare ep, Nellie gets her comeuppance and is literally kicked across the street by a humiliated Harriet when it is discovered that she cheated. I especially like the part when Nellie says to Andy ""judge not lest ye be judged.""The Family Tree (season 6)Caroline and Charles decide to legally adopt Albert, although they come to some trouble when his father reenters the picture.Annabelle (season 6)Nels is humiliated when kind-hearted Annabelle (his estranged sister) comes to town with a traveling circus, as the fat lady.Crossed Connections (season 6)Harriet again spreads hateful gossip, this time it's about Alice Garvey. I love how she stands her guard without blinking and tells Jonathan to confront his wife.May We Make Them Proud (season 6/2-part ep)The blind school is burned down and 2 lives are tragically lost. Albert takes it especially rough and runs away.Second Spring (season 6)After taking a job away from home, Nels learns to appreciate his wife and children more. I love the part when Nels confronts Charles (who caught him kissing somone) and Charles says, ""what I think about it doesn't matter.""Sylvia part 1 (season 7)Harriet brands Sylvia ""immoral"" which doesn't do much to sway the opinions of Charles and the rest of the school board when she tries to get the child thrown out of school.Sylvia part 2 (season 7)Albert decides to run away with Sylvia.A Promise To Keep (season 8)Mr. Edwards comes back to Walnut Grove (after Grace asks for a divorce) and gets into a horrible accident which nearly ruins his longstanding friendship with Charles.A Faraway Cry (season 8)Caroline and Doc. Baker go to Luisa, an old friend of Caroline's living in a camp with a flu epidemic.He Was Only Twelve part 1 (season 8)Charles sets out to find the man who shot his son.He Was Only Twelve part 2 (season 8)Although no one else does, Charles has faith that James will come out of his coma.Welcome To Olesonville (seaons 9)Harriet Oleson takes over Walnut Grove when she finds some old bonds.Sins Of The Fathers (season 9)Harriet is again back to her old tricks of spreading gossip when she writes about a new member of the community in the town's newspaper.Home Again (season 9/2-part ep)Charles and Albert go back to Walnut Grove. After Charles find out what is causing his son's behavior to change so drastically he sets out to help him.For The Love Of Blanche (season 9)Mr. Edwards takes in Blanche, a 3-year-old orangutan.Included in this comprehensive 60-DVD set is a total of 203 episodes of ""Little House on the Prairie"" (as well as 4 TV movies). The boxed set is packaged very cleverly to look like an old-fashioned covered wagon. Where else can you find a wagon filled with your favorite TV show? And each disc includes a stunning silkscreen picture on it in vivid and vibrant color.In celebration of LHOTP's 35th anniversary there are also a bunch of documentaries and featurettes. And there is even one all about Michael Landon. Made just for this collection, this details Mr. Landon's legacy, his visionary work as both a performer, an achieved director and a pioneer in the visual arts.Although the series never had a break-out character, Nellie Oleson was always a crowd pleaser. Here was this greedy, hateful little girl that had such a nasty disposition that everyone could relate to and almost root for. Viewers around the world loved to hate Nellie and it was no surprise that out of every performer from the show Alison Arngrim received the most fan mail (or hate mail). But she always managed to capture her audience because there was a remarkable quality to her that made viewers identify. Maybe it was because Nellie said and did what we all secretly wanted to do? Or maybe it was her very pronounced voice; with that high-pitched, loud almost piercing tone, was it any wonder that Nellie's voice was not manufactured in the slightest? My absolute favorite scene with Nellie was the time she set up Laura (who, by now was getting a tad self-righteous) to fail her teaching exam. Laura is spitting bullets after leaving the school-house as she catches Nellie coming back from Almonzo's place. Nellie says in her best condescending voice (with a nice broad smile on her face), ""Hello Laura, I sure hope you don't think I had anything to do with it."" It sure was great to see Nellie knock Princess-Laura down to reality. Classic! You don't want to miss everyone's favorite spoiled rich-girl as she narrates some of her nastiest Nellie eps on this set.This also includes many special features, exclusively only available with this set. There are new interviews with just about every surviving cast member from the series, including: football great Merlin Olsen, Scottie MacGregor and Karen Grassle. Melissa Sue Anderson even comes out of semi-retirement to discuss the critically-acclaimed series that made her the most famous blind television character in the entire history of American pop-culture.The series was based on the unparalleled children's books by Laura Ingalls Wilder (later by Rose Wilder Lane). However, after the third season rather than relying as heavily on the books, the writers and the producers took more poetic license. IMO these are some of the best eps because they are all so creative and life-affirming, not to mention wholesome and articulate. If you want to see a quality series then I strongly recommend getting ""Little House on the Prairie: The Complete Television Series.""",5,Celebrate Michael Landon's Legacy,1223337600,"10 7,

1186012,A2MC6BG0CMG9XC,B001EL6ECM,Melvin Jay Babb,"[9, 11]","This is one of the best shows that ever aired on TV. I remember watching some of the episodes in reruns and it was hard to keep back the tears. The few episodes that I've seen so far is pretty good quality video and sound wise. The opening credits seem to missing on a few of the episodes-not really a big deal.So why 4 stars? Well it's the packageing. I love the cover art work-the beautiful wagon-but cover art is no subsitute for stable packageing. I like the Binder idea-the abilty to turn pages like a book-each page has 3 dvds each-on the other side of the page is a short decription for each episode. While the binder idea is fine, The discs can fall out of the holders as you are turning pages-this causes scratches to appear on the discs and causes playback problems. You just need to be careful as you're turning pages-just push the discs back in the page to make them more secure. Even then, you still need to be very careful.What you get is sixty discs of pure heaven! You get the all 9 seasons(though not the pilot movie-which is another reason for my 4 star rating), 3 movies filmed after the cancelation and 3 special feauture discs.There's been a lot of talk about the fact the these appear to be edited syndicated versions. This does not really bother me. What I think happened is that the missing scenes are lost and haven't been found. This is not the fault of the company that released the dvds(though not including the pilot movie is inexcuseable)I agree with another reviewer who said it all depends on what you expect.In spite of all this and the minor problems, no one can deny that this show is the best family show that ever was on tv. This show will move you-tug your emotions and put tears in you eyes.So should you buy this set? Yes! Despite the weaknesses of the set and the packageing, The wholesome family entertainment is good enough reason to get this set.",4,Life and times on the prairie,1253577600,"09 22, 2009",2009,1890,"['one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'aired', 'TV', 'remember', 'watching', 'episodes', 'reruns', 'was', 'hard', 'keep', 'back', 'tears', 'few', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'pretty', 'good', 'quality', 'video', 'sound', 'wise', 'opening', 'credits', 'seem', 'missing', 'few', 'episodes-not', 'really', 'big', 'deal.So', 'why', '4', 'stars', 'Well', 'packageing', 'love', 'cover', 'art', 'work-the', 'beautiful', 'wagon-but', 'cover', 'art', 'subsitute', 'stable', 'packageing', 'Binder', 'idea-the', 'abilty', 'turn', 'pages', 'book-each', 'page', '3', 'dvds', 'each-on', 'other', 'side', 'page', 'short', 'decription', 'episode', 'binder', 'idea', 'fine', 'discs', 'can', 'fall', 'holders', 'are', 'turning', 'pages-this', 'causes', 'scratches', 'appear', 'discs', 'playback', 'problems', 'just', 'need', 'be', 'careful', ""'re"", 'turning', 'pages-just', 'push', 'discs', 'back', 'page', 'make', 'more', 'secure', 'Even', 'then', 'still', 'need', 'be', 'very', 'careful.What', 'get', 'sixty', 'discs', 'pure', 'heaven', 'get', '9', 'seasons', 'not', 'pilot', 'movie-which', 'reason', '4', 'star', 'rating', '3', 'movies', 'filmed', 'cancelation', '3', 'special', 'feauture', 'been', 'lot', 'talk', 'fact', 'appear', 'be', 'edited', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'not', 'really', 'bother', 'What', 'think', 'happened', 'missing', 'scenes', 'are', 'lost', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'found', 'not', 'fault', 'company', 'released', 'dvds', 'not', 'including', 'pilot', 'movie', 'inexcuseable', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'what', 'expect.In', 'spite', 'minor', 'problems', 'one', 'can', 'deny', 'show', 'best', 'family', 'show', 'ever', 'was', 'tv', 'show', 'will', 'move', 'you-tug', 'emotions', 'put', 'tears', 'eyes.So', 'should', 'buy', 'set', 'Yes', 'weaknesses', 'set', 'packageing', 'wholesome', 'family', 'entertainment', 'good', 'enough', 'reason', 'get', 'set']",Little House on the Prairie: The Complete Television Series
1186013,A3O1K7BL7E91SD,B001EL6ECM,Micah,"[289, 307]","I'm not about to go over the seasons here. I will let it be known though that Little House On The Prairie is one of the greatest TV shows ever. It was a time where TV shows were innocent fun and anyone could watch it and not have to worry about foul language or some toilet humor.  A time where shows like Gilligan's Island, The Brady Bunch, Leave It To Beaver, were all seen on regular network TV on a daily run. Kids and family alike could enjoy!!  Gosh I miss those days of TV shows.So let's get to the point of why this BOX set is so bad and a one star. Well it's simple, it's chopped up and cut to bits.  At least give fans the UNCUT version of the show. It's not like there are commercials to worry about and if you expect us to pay a couple hundred dollars to own the whole show, then put a bit of effort into it and at least give the true fans what we want. UNCUT!!!!I'm not here to complain about the price. I'll GLADLY shell out plenty of cash for any show that I love, IF the company puts a bit of effort into taking the time to give me the real deal and not this edited down junk.  I'll put my cash towards another TV box set that is UNCUT and wait for the real deal here.  I refuse to pay for this set though, just so down the road the company can put out a UNCUT version and expect fans to pay again for this.STOP BEING SO LAZY!!!  Give the fans what we want and we will gladly buy the set.  Think about it.  A fan of any show that is going to go out and buy the complete TV series of a show, is a REAL fan.  Do companies actually think that we want some cut down, chopped up nonsense as this?WE WANT LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE IN A BEAUTIFUL BOX SET, UNCUT!!!!Thank you for reading, just needed to vent.

I was hoping that they would have done a better job when they released the collection but from what I read, doesn't look like they changed much. No remastered? Color restore? Nothing? Bummer. I first saw this collection debut at $115 on Amazon. I had then went back a week later and it jumped considerably in price. BOO!!I just watched Season 7: Portrait of Love - I had to try so hard not to look at their mouths as the audio wasn't in sync. I hate that! Or if you are watching a truly warm moment and then it just abruptly cuts to the next scene. I must say that when it had commercials, they were a bit more delicate on how they changed over. Sad to say. How about a nice fade or something? No room for resonance at all. Surely they could have done better with the way they edited these films but apparently the editors didn't have the fans in mind. Seems they just wanted to put it on a dvd and make money.
