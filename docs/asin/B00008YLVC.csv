If I was to be more specific and explain what the remedy is for I would ruin the plot, so, I won't do that!  I will tell you, since I take writing these capsule reviews very seriously that I don't believe that this film is worthy of your time.  Based on a novel by Luis Chu, EAT A BOWL OF TEA examines 1940s United States and the Chinese-American experience in this country.  Due to a stringent immigration act, all Chinese men coming abroad the USA to seek work were forced to leave their wives behind.  Chinese women were not allowed to accompany their husbands, when they came seeking jobs to support their families back home.  Thus, the older Chinese men who had settled in this country twenty years before, were aging alone, without the possiblity of bringing first born sons into the world, to continue their familial lineage.  In spite of miscygenation laws, Chinese and Chinese-American men would sometimes keep company with Caucasian women, as is depicted in the example of the young main character, Ben Loy (Russell Wong).  Ben is sent home to China, by his father, to meet and marry a nice Chinese girl.  When he finds her (Cora Miao) and they get married, Loy becomes impotent (one factor possibly being stress--especially, the stress of producing an heir--something that is mandatory in the eyes of Ben's father, as well as their community).  This leads to unfortunate circumstances and choices based on frustration and embarrassment.Why didn't this film work for me?  Well, for starters, themes of family obligation, extramarital affairs, and bicultural identity were handled in a very clumsy way and the poor acting certainly didn't help.  Russell Wong's delivery of the lines was wooden (at best) and the other characters seemed more like poorly-developed caricatures.  What's more, a seduction scene that should have been sexy was more creepy.  In fact, more than one of us watching this scene thought that it almost came off more as a rape scene, which was incredibly disturbing.

Two, rarely do you see a movie with so many Asian-American men.  Three, this movie illustrates that Asians did live in the US before 1965's liberalization of immigration laws.  Still, in this movie, when Russell is a gigolo for a white female client, he's sexually active.  However, when he has a cute Chinese wife, he's impotent.  This seems like some disturbing white-worshipping to me.  It's kinda anti-Asian woman too.  Haven't we seen and heard enough of historical stereotypes of Asian men as not true masculines?!

750421,A1S6U42368WJQE,B00008YLVC,"Steven Daedalus ""Steve""","[0, 0]","The title is a little silly -- ""Eat A Bowl of Tea"".  It should be a Doris Day Comedy.  But the film is rather better than its title.A young man, Wong, goes back to Hong Kong and brings back a bride, Miao.  It's America in the post-war years.  Both Wong and Miao live in the ethnic community of Chinatown just south of Canal Street in New York.  They're surrounded by friends and family members, including their fathers.  The marriage becomes rocky when Wong is unable to perform his husbandly duties, as a line of dialog has it in the similarly structured ""The Family Way.""  Wong's doctor prescribes a vacation and Wong's impotence is overcome -- but only temporarily.  When they return to New York, so does Wong's problem.Miao, a beautiful young woman, is easily seduced by a smooth-talking cad.  (The cast is all Chinese but speak mostly English.)  A pregnancy results and Wong has to check the dates of their vacation to make certain that he is the father.  He has no idea Miao is getting wood elsewhere.There are several comic scenes but it all leads to violence, the ultimate repair of the marriage and the departure of the couple for San Francisco, and a slight but palpable collapse in the community itself.One of the features I appreciate most about the film is its informational content.  The acting sometimes seems amateurish but the ethos is convincingly captured.  See how a fortune-cookie machine is operated.  There's a good deal of talk about people gossiping and the victims losing face.  Well -- it's not a stereotype.  In Chinatown, a shop never ""goes out of business.""  It is simply ""closed for repairs"" because no one wants to lose face by failing in a business.And if fathers play an inordinately important role it's because fathers are inordinately important in the Chinese family.  An anthropologist has reported a sobbing father beating the casket of his son, who died before being old enough to take care of his parents.  It's called filial piety.  In this movie, a father takes revenge on the man cuckolding his son -- not for the sake of his son but because his own name is being debased.I now leave the lectern.  Thank you.  I wouldn't have brought all this up except that it might seem strange to American viewers who are unfamiliar with Chinese culture outside of General Tso's chicken.  Inside General Tso's chicken it's too dark for anything to be familiar.It is regrettable that the performances aren't better than they are, but the fact is they don't quite live up to the quality of the story.  Still, the odd-sounding locutions grow on you after a while so that they become taken for granted and less noticeable.It would be a mistake to dismiss this movie because it sounds in any way ""cute.""  It's complicated.  There's quite a lot going on but very little of it is cute.
