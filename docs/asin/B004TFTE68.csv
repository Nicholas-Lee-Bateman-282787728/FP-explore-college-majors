The main issue with the film as a whole is its pacing and focus on political intrigue over character which takes some good time to go thorough. The fight scenes are nice and looks great on blue ray. Overwhelming focus on politics and emotionless battles, this movie is a great process of Thai filmmaker Chatreechalerm Yukol. Worth to watch and keep if you are a fan of old days wars movies.This item brings 'Kingdom of War: Part I & Part II' to Blu-ray on two separate BD-50 discs housed together in a standard case.

I had the good fortune to visit Thailand and enjoyed the people and culture. For some of older folks I enjoyed going to the movies to see the musical masterpiece The King and I. However, like a similar foreign film called the Red Cliff I struggled with the first part of this 2 disk set trying to get a handle on which of the various Lords was on which side. The main characters were not a problem but, who was aligned with each was a big problem with me I just could not keep track. So with the subtitles and the foreign names it was tough.

I thought it was truly awful. Yet hope sprung eternal and when KINGDOM OF WAR came out I got it to see if/how far Thai film making had progressed.Oops, the first disk of this two-disk Blu-ray was awkward, talky; a mush of cute kids and glum,sour generals discussing their problems (maybe a set-up history lesson?) Radically boring. But thankfully  mercifully short.BUT THE SECOND DISK CAME ALIVE! Great in every respect.  Writing, design, production,characterizations, acting, battle action; it's long too; over two and a half  hours.I was amazed and delighted.Disk Two's action historic drama doesn't have boring discussions as in that firstdisk. Suddenly it seems nepotism is out and 21st-Century Thai film-making is in.For Amazon's great two-disk Blu-ray price of $17.99, in Disk one you'll see Thailand's lush scenery, stunning temples, historically-accurate costumes and weaponry. (I spent seven years in Thailand, learning about this incredible country) Disk One is a true-to-life history drama of Thai wars with Burma (now renamed 'Miramar')The real cinema treat is in the second DVD, which is much longer. And SUPERB in every aspect.I collect Asian films (mostly Japanese and Chinese). They're having a real renaissance,blowing Hollywood and Bollywood away). If this surprise film is typical of new Thai films,then there goes my movie budget.In the last decade Chinese and Japanese films have made giant leaps. For more welcome-to-a-new-age entertaining Thai films, seeChocolate. It's no period piece; taking place in modern-day Bangkok. There's alsoBangkok Dangerous [Blu-ray] a Western-Thai collaboration shot in Bangkok, starring Hollywood's hardest-working actor of late, Nicholas Cage.Both well-done action flicks offering keen looks at Thailand, unique and memorable.A long-time fan of Thailand, I hope their films continue improving. In the meantime, to see how far Asian film has come, here are six surprising titles:  HERO, LEGEND OF THE BLACK SCORPION, BATTLE OF THE WARRIORS, THE BALLAD OF NARAYAMA, HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS and DEATH NOTE.
