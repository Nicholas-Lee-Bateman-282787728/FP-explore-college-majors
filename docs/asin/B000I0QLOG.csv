1017840,A4PTUEVFE13K6,B000I0QLOG,Allen Chapman,"[1, 5]","The idea for this DVD may sound a bit odd for those not fimiliar with the concept. It's director Kevin Smith (""Clerks"", ""Mallrats"", ""Jersey Girl"" etc) doing a Q&A with a college audience, in this case in London and Toronto. The idea doesn't sound all that interesting but in fact it is. And the result is a very funny conversation about life, movie making, Ben Afleck, Dora The Explorer, Lord Of The Rings and much more! Because Kevin has a tendancy to go off on tangents you get the feel you're watching a stand up act. The difference is this isn't rehearsed but it's just as funny.

1017842,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000I0QLOG,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 3]","I remember watching the film Batman Returns with the commentary by Tim Burton once. Such a great looking, stylized film and the commentary was filled with so many ""you know""'s and ""uh""'s that you can tell at times that most of his genius is in his head and not actually telling you how he does it. Kevin Smith, while not the greatest visual director and even he will tell you so, has a whole lot to say and in between bouts of slight frustration with the guy, it's really quite interesting to just hear the guy talk about everything.Disc I is probably my least favorite one, with a Q&A; he did in Toronto. Granted Smith does what he does, and well, the only problem is despite an enthusiastic audience, they ask some of the most inane questions that Smith can't do anything with. Or at times they go on and on and you're like ""be quiet and give the mic to someone else"". Some stories are interesting such as his fascination for Dora the Explorer and his power trip when he became Student Council President. His daughter Harley introduces the show and Jason Mewes and Smith's wife Jen shows up as well. Again, it's a show that has its occasional funny parts (ninjas in Passion of the Christ?) but the audience severely slowed the pace.What should be your first trip going in is the show he did in London. Some of the stories he tells are fascinating such as shooting his wife for a Playboy shoot, as well as his daughter's fascination with the word ****(the s one) and her eventual horror as to what it actually means. Not to mention a raunchy alternate idea he would have to close Return of the King. Don't think that pace-killing audience members stayed in Canada either. The most inane question is asked (""if you were half man half sausage, which half would you be?"") and much time is spent on a woman who asks about sex euphemisms not because she's a total blonde, well that too, but Smith couldn't even hear her at times. More consistently funny than Toronto, this is the better show of the 2.That ""frustration"" I mentioned earlier? Well I guess the writer/director of Mallrats and Chasing Amy is just who he is, as he says in the show, but the excessive potty humor doesn't really derail the film so much as it makes you wish he would skip the excessive jokes about male oral sex and do intelligent monologues like during the show. And like Tim Burton with his ""ya know?"", Smith loves saying ""and s***"". Take a drink when he says it and you'll be on the floor before he leaves the stage.I haven't seen the first one so I can't compare it but as it is, it is a funny and intimate look at a director known more for his words than anything else...except for being a fat guy, as he says.",4,"Hysterical and importantly, honest",1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2006,2688,"['remember', 'watching', 'film', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'commentary', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'once', 'Such', 'great', 'looking', 'stylized', 'film', 'commentary', 'was', 'filled', 'so', 'many', 'know', 'uh', 'can', 'tell', 'times', 'most', 'genius', 'head', 'not', 'actually', 'telling', 'how', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'not', 'greatest', 'visual', 'director', 'even', 'will', 'tell', 'so', 'whole', 'lot', 'say', 'bouts', 'slight', 'frustration', 'guy', 'really', 'quite', 'interesting', 'just', 'hear', 'guy', 'talk', 'everything.Disc', 'probably', 'least', 'favorite', 'one', 'Q', 'A', 'did', 'Toronto', 'Granted', 'Smith', 'what', 'well', 'only', 'problem', 'enthusiastic', 'audience', 'ask', 'most', 'inane', 'questions', 'Smith', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'times', 'go', ""'re"", 'be', 'quiet', 'give', 'mic', 'someone', 'else', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'such', 'fascination', 'Dora', 'Explorer', 'power', 'trip', 'when', 'became', 'Student', 'Council', 'President', 'daughter', 'Harley', 'show', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'Smith', 'wife', 'Jen', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'Again', 'show', 'occasional', 'funny', 'parts', 'ninjas', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'audience', 'severely', 'slowed', 'pace.What', 'should', 'be', 'first', 'trip', 'going', 'show', 'did', 'London', 'stories', 'are', 'fascinating', 'such', 'shooting', 'wife', 'Playboy', 'shoot', 'as', 'well', 'daughter', 'fascination', 'word', '****', 's', 'one', 'eventual', 'horror', 'what', 'actually', 'Not', 'mention', 'raunchy', 'alternate', 'idea', 'would', 'have', 'close', 'Return', 'King', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'pace-killing', 'audience', 'members', 'stayed', 'Canada', 'most', 'inane', 'question', 'asked', 'were', 'half', 'man', 'half', 'sausage', 'half', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'woman', 'who', 'sex', 'euphemisms', 'not', 'total', 'blonde', 'well', 'too', 'Smith', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'hear', 'times', 'More', 'consistently', 'funny', 'Toronto', 'better', 'show', '2.That', 'frustration', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'Well', 'guess', 'writer/director', 'Mallrats', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'just', 'who', 'show', 'excessive', 'potty', 'humor', ""n't"", 'really', 'derail', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'wish', 'would', 'skip', 'excessive', 'jokes', 'male', 'oral', 'sex', 'do', 'intelligent', 'monologues', 'show', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'ya', 'know', 'Smith', 'saying', 's***', 'Take', 'drink', 'when', ""'ll"", 'be', 'floor', 'stage.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'one', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'funny', 'intimate', 'look', 'director', 'known', 'more', 'words', 'anything', 'else', 'being', 'fat', 'guy']",N/A

A lot of people have said this already about this DVD, and it is because it's true. You get Kevin, for nearly three hours on these two discs, answering all of the questions we always wanted to know. There are a lot of funny moments, but all of it is very informative. It is just something that you have to have if you are a fan, simple as that. I'm a Q&A; fan, so I love listening to my favorite writer/director spill his guts on topics and just learn more from the man. If you are like me, once again, get it!An Evening with Kevin Smith 2: Evening HarderThe title of the movie says it all, this is definitely a more dirtier and possibly offensive Kevin Smith. If you don't understand his humor, good odds are that there will be something you will be offended by. Jesus, America, and the sex life of his deceased dad are all addressed in the sequel. That wasn't what lost me, but like many here have said, it just wasn't as funny and didn't answer a lot of questions like the first movie did. Kevin gets asked a question then gets side tracked and goes on for thirty minutes about things that aren't even related to the topic. This happens more than once when he asks ""What was your question?"" It'd be great, but he just kind of rambles on stuff that isn't that funny, except to himself. There are some things he said that had me laughing a long while after he said it, but sadly, the entire show wasn't like that.However, Disc 2 in London is hilarious! It is back to the quality of the first documentary, at least for me. It had a really good Q & A and the jokes were really funny!Overall, this is a good collection to get if you are a fan. It's just that the second movie isn't as good as the first, only the second disc of Evening Harder really lives up to the first movie. You may not agree with the review, but watch it yourself and you will see that the second isn't nearly as good, until disc 2.

1017845,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000I0QLOG,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","***TREAD LIGHTLY - PLENTY OF SPOILERS HERE***Uh-oh...here comes that potty-mouth man again! Kevin Smith (CLERKS, DOGMA, JERSEY GIRL) made successful, raucous noise with AN EVENING WITH KEVIN SMITH, a 2002 film documenting several Q & A stand-up tours he conducted in several college venues. Now, the articulate but unapologetically vulgar writer/director, who is as wardrobe-challenged as ever, returns, this time with a lengthier 2-disc effort. It's as raunchy and irreverent as the first EVENING WITH... And, yes, at a grand total of 239 minutes, this sequel might prove to be too arduous for the average fella with a life, especially when one factors in some of the horrendously inane questions asked by the audience participants (such as ""What would be your word of the day?"" or ""If you could be half man, half dog, which part would be which?""), but, you know what, the fat guy's still as funny and eloquent as ever.You'd think he'd rein in the cusswords a bit - what with his mother being in the London audience and all - but nuh-uh. He even includes her in some of his impromptu bits. Kevin Smith remains an entertaining, stream-of-consciousness storyteller, and I admire his frankness and fearlessness. Any seemingly innocuous question (say, for example, about the film industry) could prompt him into a convoluted response which then, oft times, segues or dovetails to a more intimately detailed account of his personal life.Disc 1 contains Q & A concert footage shot in Toronto as Kevin's snippet of a daughter, Harley, cutely introduces him to the maple leaf crowd. Kevin then comes out and immediately begins riffing on sundry topics, some of which are: writer's block and writer's laze, how DORA THE EXPLORER is better enjoyed when smokin' a little somethin' something', more dirt about Prince, his monetary net worth (5 bucks), Mel Gibson and THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, etc. The Toronto concert also showcases cameos by the cooly taciturn Jason Muse and Kevin's hot wifey, Jen.Disc 2 finds London's Criterion Theatre playing host to Kevin Smith as the audience learns, amongst other things, of Kevin's thoughts regarding the X-Men (and its associated parable), his views on certain of the British press, what his version of a Green Hornet film would be, stuff about bears and cubs, his favorite come-on line, and yet more fun facts about his wife, including his experiences directing her for a P1ayboy shoot.Those who have nothing better to do is invited to hang around each disc's main menu screen and view 5 and a half extra minutes per disc of Smith's goofy, time-filler shenanigans. Disc 1 has an 11-minute long ""Limo Ride"" bonus featurette (Kevin hits the Toronto streets to ask the populace this question, ""What is Canadian cuisine?""), while Disc 2 offers an amusing 6 and a half minute-long ""Man on the Street"" featurette (Jason Mewes tests various pick-up lines on the London honeys).Kevin Smith is a joy to watch as he sweatily navigates and fields the sometimes penetrating, but more often than not, insipid audience questions. He's charming and doesn't hold back and manages to gently remonstrates the more brain-deficient members in the theater (this, by the way, demonstrates that just because you have a cool Brit accent, it doesn't mean you automatically have higher I.Q.). As diverting as I find Kevin Smith to be, it still took me multiple sessions with the DVD player before I could go thru the two discs. There are times when Kevin rambles on ad nauseam and rolls off the non sequitur stuff. But, for the most part, Smith offers fascinating and perceptive insider insights on various Hollywood industry topics, as well as, again, being upfront with his home-spun, hide-nothing opinions. Coupled with his rapier wit and penchant for self-mockery, this funny fat man glues you to whatever surface your behind is planted on.",4,"""Would you like a portion?""",1165708800,"12 10, 2006",2006,3853,"['***TREAD', 'LIGHTLY', 'PLENTY', 'SPOILERS', 'HERE***Uh-oh', 'here', 'potty-mouth', 'man', 'again', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'CLERKS', 'DOGMA', 'JERSEY', 'GIRL', 'made', 'successful', 'raucous', 'noise', 'AN', 'EVENING', 'WITH', 'KEVIN', 'SMITH', '2002', 'film', 'documenting', 'several', 'Q', 'A', 'stand-up', 'tours', 'conducted', 'several', 'college', 'venues', 'Now', 'articulate', 'unapologetically', 'vulgar', 'writer/director', 'who', 'as', 'wardrobe-challenged', 'ever', 'returns', 'time', 'lengthier', '2-disc', 'effort', 'raunchy', 'irreverent', 'first', 'EVENING', 'WITH', 'yes', 'grand', 'total', '239', 'minutes', 'sequel', 'might', 'prove', 'be', 'too', 'arduous', 'average', 'fella', 'life', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'factors', 'horrendously', 'inane', 'questions', 'asked', 'audience', 'participants', 'such', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'word', 'day', 'could', 'be', 'half', 'man', 'half', 'dog', 'part', 'would', 'be', 'know', 'what', 'fat', 'guy', 'still', 'funny', 'eloquent', 'ever.You', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'rein', 'cusswords', 'bit', 'what', 'mother', 'being', 'London', 'audience', 'nuh-uh', 'even', 'impromptu', 'bits', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'entertaining', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'storyteller', 'admire', 'frankness', 'fearlessness', 'seemingly', 'innocuous', 'question', 'say', 'example', 'film', 'industry', 'could', 'prompt', 'convoluted', 'response', 'then', 'oft', 'times', 'segues', 'dovetails', 'more', 'intimately', 'detailed', 'account', 'personal', 'life.Disc', '1', 'contains', 'Q', 'A', 'concert', 'footage', 'shot', 'Toronto', 'Kevin', 'snippet', 'daughter', 'Harley', 'cutely', 'maple', 'leaf', 'crowd', 'Kevin', 'then', 'out', 'immediately', 'riffing', 'sundry', 'topics', 'are', 'writer', 'block', 'writer', 'laze', 'how', 'DORA', 'THE', 'EXPLORER', 'better', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'smokin', 'little', 'somethin', 'something', 'more', 'dirt', 'Prince', 'monetary', 'net', 'worth', '5', 'bucks', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'THE', 'PASSION', 'THE', 'CHRIST', 'etc', 'Toronto', 'concert', 'also', 'cameos', 'cooly', 'taciturn', 'Jason', 'Muse', 'Kevin', 'hot', 'wifey', 'Jen.Disc', '2', 'London', 'Criterion', 'Theatre', 'playing', 'host', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'audience', 'other', 'things', 'Kevin', 'thoughts', 'regarding', 'X-Men', 'associated', 'parable', 'views', 'certain', 'British', 'press', 'what', 'version', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'stuff', 'bears', 'cubs', 'favorite', 'come-on', 'line', 'yet', 'more', 'fun', 'facts', 'wife', 'including', 'experiences', 'directing', 'P1ayboy', 'shoot.Those', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'invited', 'hang', 'disc', 'main', 'menu', 'screen', 'view', '5', 'half', 'extra', 'minutes', 'disc', 'Smith', 'goofy', 'time-filler', 'shenanigans', 'Disc', '1', '11-minute', 'long', 'Limo', 'Ride', 'bonus', 'featurette', 'Kevin', 'Toronto', 'streets', 'ask', 'populace', 'question', 'What', 'Canadian', 'cuisine', 'Disc', '2', 'amusing', '6', 'half', 'minute-long', 'Man', 'Street', 'featurette', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'various', 'pick-up', 'lines', 'London', 'honeys', '.Kevin', 'Smith', 'joy', 'watch', 'sweatily', 'sometimes', 'penetrating', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'insipid', 'audience', 'questions', 'charming', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'gently', 'more', 'brain-deficient', 'members', 'theater', 'way', 'just', 'have', 'cool', 'Brit', 'accent', ""n't"", 'mean', 'automatically', 'have', 'higher', 'I.Q.', 'As', 'diverting', 'find', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'be', 'still', 'took', 'multiple', 'sessions', 'DVD', 'player', 'could', 'go', 'thru', 'two', 'discs', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Kevin', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'rolls', 'non', 'sequitur', 'stuff', 'most', 'part', 'Smith', 'fascinating', 'perceptive', 'insider', 'insights', 'various', 'Hollywood', 'industry', 'topics', 'as', 'well', 'again', 'being', 'upfront', 'home-spun', 'hide-nothing', 'opinions', 'Coupled', 'rapier', 'wit', 'penchant', 'self-mockery', 'funny', 'fat', 'man', 'glues', 'whatever', 'surface', 'behind', 'planted']",N/A

1017848,AFRZL05D54MPM,B000I0QLOG,JWolf,"[1, 1]","""An Evening with Kevin Smith"" is a set of DVDs featuring Q&A; sessions from screenwriter, actor, film producer, director, comic book writer, author, podcaster, and comedian Kevin Patrick Smith.  Smith first came on the scene with the 1994 independent film ""Clerks,"" a low-budget comedy in which Smith debuted `Jay and Silent Bob.'  While most Q&A; sessions are best kept for one-time-viewing, ""An Evening with Kevin Smith"" is more like an interactive stand-up comedy set.One of the big things that sets Kevin Smith apart from other comedian/writers is how easily he meshes with the general population.  Again, I'll reiterate that this is not your typical Q&A; everything this man has to say is funny (but you probably want to be at least a little familiar with Smith's work prior to watching, some people don't care for his brand of humor).  An avid ""Clerks"" and ""Dogma"" fan, I found these DVDs incredibly entertaining; Kevin Smith's on-the-spot improvisation is highlighted in these Q&As;, further attesting to his comedic brilliance.  Sooo... if you're a Kevin Smith fan, I think you'll really enjoy watching his version of stand-up; if you've never heard of the guy, it probably isn't worth purchasing.___________""An Evening with Kevin Smith""--Unrated 2-disc set (224 minute run-time) from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released in December of 2002.SPECIAL FEATURES:  Bonus Trailers.The first ""Evening"" takes place between 2001 and 2002 at the American Colleges:  Clark University, Indiana University, University of Wyoming, and Cornell University.  During his visits, fans flocked to ask questions of Smith related to how he became involved in the film industry, his relationships with various celebrities (notably Jason Mewes and Ben Affleck), and where he gets the inspiration for his characters and storylines.___________""An Evening with Kevin Smith 2:  Evening Harder""--Unrated 2-disc set (239 minute run-time) from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released in 2006.SPECIAL FEATURES:  Toronto Stand-Up Concert, Toronto:  Limo Ride Featurette (Kevin Smith hits the streets of Toronto, determined to answer the all-important question, ""What is Canadian cuisine?""), London Stand-Up Concert, London:  Man on the Street Featurette (Kevin Smith sidekick Jason Mewes tries out various pick-up lines on the ladies in London).The second edition of Q&A; sessions from Kevin Smith was shot in Toronto and London.  Going into this set, I had a hard time wrapping my head around `what more could Smith have to say?'  But being among non-domestic fans opens up an opportunity for Smith to poke fun at the cultural differences that divide American fans from the British and Canadian varieties.  In addition, ""Evening Harder"" opens up more of Smith's personal life to the public, and nothing is off-limits.  Throughout the evenings, Kevin discusses his marriage, `Playboy,' his own physique, `X-Men' (as a means of homosexual release), and even Mel Gibson--though that last one could probably fill up its own Q&A;.",4,Two Evenings of Interactive Stand-Up Comedy,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,3009,"['Evening', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'set', 'DVDs', 'featuring', 'Q', 'A', 'sessions', 'screenwriter', 'actor', 'film', 'producer', 'director', 'comic', 'book', 'writer', 'author', 'podcaster', 'comedian', 'Kevin', 'Patrick', 'Smith', 'Smith', 'first', 'came', 'scene', '1994', 'independent', 'film', 'Clerks', 'low-budget', 'comedy', 'Smith', 'debuted', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'most', 'Q', 'A', 'sessions', 'are', 'best', 'kept', 'one-time-viewing', 'Evening', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'more', 'interactive', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'set.One', 'big', 'things', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'apart', 'other', 'comedian/writers', 'how', 'easily', 'general', 'population', 'Again', ""'ll"", 'reiterate', 'not', 'typical', 'Q', 'A', 'everything', 'man', 'say', 'funny', 'probably', 'want', 'be', 'least', 'little', 'familiar', 'Smith', 'work', 'prior', 'watching', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'brand', 'humor', 'avid', 'Clerks', 'Dogma', 'fan', 'found', 'DVDs', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'on-the-spot', 'improvisation', 'highlighted', 'Q', 'As', 'further', 'attesting', 'comedic', 'brilliance', 'Sooo', ""'re"", 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'fan', 'think', ""'ll"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'version', 'stand-up', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'guy', 'probably', ""n't"", 'worth', 'purchasing.___________', 'Evening', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Unrated', '2-disc', 'set', '224', 'minute', 'run-time', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'released', 'December', '2002.SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'Bonus', 'Trailers.The', 'first', 'Evening', 'place', '2001', '2002', 'American', 'Colleges', 'Clark', 'University', 'Indiana', 'University', 'University', 'Wyoming', 'Cornell', 'University', 'visits', 'fans', 'flocked', 'ask', 'questions', 'Smith', 'related', 'how', 'became', 'involved', 'film', 'industry', 'relationships', 'various', 'celebrities', 'notably', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'where', 'inspiration', 'characters', 'storylines.___________', 'Evening', 'Kevin', 'Smith', '2', 'Evening', 'Harder', 'Unrated', '2-disc', 'set', '239', 'minute', 'run-time', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'released', '2006.SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'Toronto', 'Stand-Up', 'Concert', 'Toronto', 'Limo', 'Ride', 'Featurette', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'streets', 'Toronto', 'determined', 'answer', 'all-important', 'question', 'What', 'Canadian', 'cuisine', 'London', 'Stand-Up', 'Concert', 'London', 'Man', 'Street', 'Featurette', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'sidekick', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'out', 'various', 'pick-up', 'lines', 'ladies', 'London', '.The', 'second', 'edition', 'Q', 'A', 'sessions', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'was', 'shot', 'Toronto', 'London', 'Going', 'set', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'wrapping', 'head', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'Smith', 'have', 'say', 'being', 'non-domestic', 'fans', 'up', 'opportunity', 'Smith', 'poke', 'fun', 'cultural', 'differences', 'divide', 'American', 'fans', 'British', 'Canadian', 'varieties', 'addition', 'Evening', 'Harder', 'up', 'more', 'Smith', 'personal', 'life', 'public', 'nothing', 'off-limits', 'evenings', 'Kevin', 'marriage', 'Playboy', 'own', 'physique', 'X-Men', 'means', 'homosexual', 'release', 'even', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'last', 'one', 'could', 'probably', 'fill', 'up', 'own', 'Q', 'A']",N/A

It was nowhere near as funny as any of the material on the original ""Evening with Kevin Smith"" DVD.  A few parts were worth a chuckle, I laughed out loud once or twice but mostly I just sat there waiting for it to get better. The stories were longer and more drawn out than usual, (Dora the Explorer comes to mind) and some bits extremely painful. (Like the first question asked of the night.) It also appears that the show was filmed quite a while ago, as the material was pretty well dated - Bush just getting re-elected, Ben Affleck single.While I am a huge KS fan, and know he can tell an awesome story, I am under the impression that he pushed this lame disc out in time for the holidays.Once I watch the second disc and all of the bonus material, I'll be back to revise this. In the meantime, I'd recommend renting it vs. buying it.12/29/06 - Ok, I'm back.  Watched the London disc. I liked it better than the Toronto disc but i still don't find anywhere as good as Kevin's first go at this.

One guy asks a concise two-part question, in response Smith makes a crack about it being a 46-part question.

Not too long ago my husband and I watched the original, which I was familiar with since I had seen Kevin Smith do a Q&A when he came to UCF. First there is too much material between the first and second movies to watch them back to back. But I would advise watching the first one first, which I found to be much more entertaining than the second. Not that the second is by any means bad. I would still recommend this one to anyone, but there is a definate change in Kevin between the first and second (He's now a daddy) so I would say he's a bit more mellow during this go round. He is also less bitter which is part of what made the first one so funny. Mewes does make an appearance or two, but his contribution on the first DVD of the set hovers as a 2 line cameo. Do I recommend it? Of course, but remember this IS Kevin Smith, it's profane, insightful, crude, playful, and will leave you with a different view on ""Dora the Explorer"".

From start to finish. On Disc 2 you will find a Q & A he did in Great Britain. That fact is important because you notice that he is very aware that this is a show that is coming out on DVD. So he desperately tries to come up with somewhat interesting stories and also he really tries to be funny and doesn't just let it happen. On the first 'Evening with Kevin Smith' Edition you didn't get the impression that he was under some kind of pressure to produce a certain product. You will notice that he even mentions the title 'Evening Harder' a couple of times. There is one thing though that I didn't like and no other Smith Fan could possibly like: The Material shown to us on this 2-Disc Set is pretty outdated. The producers could have made an effort to bring us some more up-to-date material. Aside from that, what can I tell you? You see Smith for about 4 hours standing on stage telling stories that are funny and often interesting but have sometimes (quite often actually) not much to do with the question asked. A welcome surprise was to see an, obviously, drug-free Jason Mewes on stage. Of interest to those people who know the first 'Evening with Kevin Smith' should also be, that he does a couple of follow up stories. As for me, I enjoyed it a great deal.

Fisher,"[1, 1]","I see that Amazon is cross-posting reviews of ""An Evening with Kevin Smith"" 1 and 2, so I'll just cover both movies here.I am maybe typical of a portion of Kevin Smith's audience. I saw ""Clerks"", loved it, and have seen a few others (Mallrats, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) and didn't really love them as much.But I must say I was surprised at how entertaining Smith is in these movies. The common points between Smith the director and Smith the public speaker -- or maybe standup comic would be more accurate -- are the sophomoric humor, cheap sex jokes and gratuitous swearing. But these things often seem forced and contrived in his movies, where they are likely to be delivered in stilted dialog right out of the George Lucas school of ""no one talks like that"" screenwriting. In person, however, he actually turns out to be a naturally gifted and engaging speaker. If you can manage not to be offended by his sometimes offensive humor, Smith is incredibly charming, likable and funny on stage.The first movie, ""An Evening with Kevin Smith"" was filmed at five or six different universities, with excerpts from the various shows spliced together into a four-hour movie spanning two DVDs. His half-hour take on a disastrously weird attempt to film a documentary for Prince is one of the most fascinating and hilarious things I've seen, and his recounting of a time working on a script for a Superman movie is also fabulous. His excruciatingly detailed account of how he met and first had sex with his wife may not be for the faint of heart. But as these topics suggest, Smith doesn't limit his talk to his own movies -- which means that even if you're not a fan of Smith the director, you might find some very enjoyable moments from Smith the speaker/standup comic.The second movie, ""An Evening with Kevin Smith 2: Evening Harder"" was filmed in Toronto and London, and here the shows are presented on separate discs, not spliced together. It is more of the same idea -- Smith talking about his work, his life, Hollywood and anything else people can think to ask him. In Toronto, one of my favorite bits again was his follow-up explanation of the fallout from the Prince narrative on the first DVD set. The London show on disc 2 really had some of the funniest moments I've ever seen. I was laughing harder than I have in some time.These movies have put Kevin Smith into new perspective for me, and I'm going to watch his other movies now. I actually grew to like him a lot more by watching these. This might not be the case for everyone, especially people offended by swearing and sometimes gratuitously sexual humor.",4,Almost better at standup than directing!,1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,2620,"['see', 'Amazon', 'cross-posting', 'reviews', 'Evening', 'Kevin', 'Smith', '1', '2', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'cover', 'movies', 'here.I', 'am', 'maybe', 'typical', 'portion', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'audience', 'saw', 'Clerks', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'others', 'Mallrats', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'Strike', 'Back', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'love', 'much.But', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'entertaining', 'Smith', 'movies', 'common', 'points', 'Smith', 'director', 'Smith', 'public', 'speaker', 'maybe', 'standup', 'comic', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'are', 'sophomoric', 'humor', 'cheap', 'sex', 'jokes', 'gratuitous', 'swearing', 'things', 'often', 'seem', 'forced', 'contrived', 'movies', 'where', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'delivered', 'stilted', 'dialog', 'right', 'George', 'Lucas', 'school', 'one', 'screenwriting', 'person', 'however', 'actually', 'out', 'be', 'naturally', 'gifted', 'engaging', 'speaker', 'can', 'manage', 'not', 'be', 'offended', 'sometimes', 'offensive', 'humor', 'Smith', 'incredibly', 'charming', 'likable', 'funny', 'stage.The', 'first', 'movie', 'Evening', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'was', 'filmed', 'five', 'six', 'different', 'universities', 'excerpts', 'various', 'shows', 'spliced', 'together', 'four-hour', 'movie', 'spanning', 'two', 'DVDs', 'half-hour', 'take', 'disastrously', 'weird', 'attempt', 'film', 'documentary', 'Prince', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'hilarious', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recounting', 'time', 'working', 'script', 'Superman', 'movie', 'also', 'fabulous', 'excruciatingly', 'detailed', 'account', 'how', 'met', 'first', 'had', 'sex', 'wife', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'faint', 'heart', 'topics', 'suggest', 'Smith', ""n't"", 'limit', 'talk', 'own', 'movies', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'Smith', 'director', 'might', 'find', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'moments', 'Smith', 'speaker/standup', 'comic.The', 'second', 'movie', 'Evening', 'Kevin', 'Smith', '2', 'Evening', 'Harder', 'was', 'filmed', 'Toronto', 'London', 'here', 'shows', 'are', 'presented', 'separate', 'discs', 'not', 'spliced', 'together', 'more', 'same', 'idea', 'Smith', 'talking', 'work', 'life', 'Hollywood', 'anything', 'else', 'people', 'can', 'think', 'ask', 'Toronto', 'one', 'favorite', 'bits', 'again', 'was', 'follow-up', 'explanation', 'fallout', 'Prince', 'narrative', 'first', 'DVD', 'set', 'London', 'show', 'disc', '2', 'really', 'had', 'funniest', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'laughing', 'harder', 'have', 'time.These', 'movies', 'have', 'put', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'new', 'perspective', ""'m"", 'going', 'watch', 'other', 'movies', 'now', 'actually', 'grew', 'like', 'lot', 'more', 'watching', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'everyone', 'especially', 'people', 'offended', 'swearing', 'sometimes', 'gratuitously', 'sexual', 'humor']",N/A
