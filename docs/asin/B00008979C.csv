736261,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00008979C,Austin Somlo,"[2, 6]","Viewed: 11/03, 10/11Rate: 110/11: The 6th Man is a very hard picture to watch because it basically says that cheating is okay as long as nobody is hurt in the process. It doesn't teach moral lessons either; just a film depicting a lot of selfish individuals that made me sick to my stomach. Plus, many of the scenes are extremely awkward to watch. Every game the team cheats in, the more of a fraud the team is. That's why lately so many teams in NCAA sports have been stripped off of victories, scholarships, and eligibility to participate in post-season play because it's still illegal and it's wrong. It gets worse when you have like over five to ten million spectators watching NCAA basketball, there isn't a group of analyzers of the tape appearing and pointing out how totally wrong the whole vision looks. I mean, opponents are always studying the tape to prepare for upcoming games, and of course, this is invariably omitted in the film because nobody wants to deal with that obvious fact. No wonder why I loved the movie called Blue Chips. I mean, that is how real NCAA sports get. If you notice closely the coaches who have agreed to be involved in the filming of The 6th Man, they are Jim Harrick, Jerry Tarkanian, and Nolan Richardson. Jim Harrick's resume of NCAA violations is very lengthy as it involves academic fraud, improper benefits, lying to investigators, and illegal recruiting. Next is Jerry Tarkanian and his famous recruiting and point shaving scandals. Finally, Nolan Richardson...he may have not cheated, but his son certainly did commit many NCAA violations and also brandished a gun at an assistant coach during a basketball practice. So much for ""like father, like son"" theory. Now, I just have one simple question: why did University of Washington agree to lend its name to a film that condoned cheating? So stupid, stupid, stupid. Obviously, the ending of the film is predictable as it gets. So why bother sitting around for it anyway? All in all, The 6th Man is one of the worst films made.",1,C H E A T I N G IS WRONG!,1318550400,"10 14, 2011",2011,2024,"['Viewed', '11/03', '10/11Rate', '110/11', '6th', 'Man', 'very', 'hard', 'picture', 'watch', 'basically', 'cheating', 'okay', 'as', 'long', 'nobody', 'hurt', 'process', ""n't"", 'teach', 'moral', 'lessons', 'just', 'film', 'depicting', 'lot', 'selfish', 'individuals', 'made', 'sick', 'stomach', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'extremely', 'awkward', 'watch', 'game', 'team', 'cheats', 'more', 'fraud', 'team', 'why', 'lately', 'so', 'many', 'teams', 'NCAA', 'sports', 'have', 'been', 'stripped', 'victories', 'scholarships', 'eligibility', 'participate', 'post-season', 'play', 'still', 'illegal', 'wrong', 'worse', 'when', 'have', 'like', 'over', 'five', 'ten', 'million', 'spectators', 'watching', 'NCAA', 'basketball', ""n't"", 'group', 'analyzers', 'tape', 'appearing', 'pointing', 'out', 'how', 'totally', 'wrong', 'whole', 'vision', 'mean', 'opponents', 'are', 'always', 'studying', 'tape', 'prepare', 'upcoming', 'games', 'course', 'invariably', 'omitted', 'film', 'nobody', 'deal', 'obvious', 'fact', 'wonder', 'why', 'loved', 'movie', 'called', 'Blue', 'Chips', 'mean', 'how', 'real', 'NCAA', 'sports', 'get', 'notice', 'closely', 'coaches', 'who', 'have', 'agreed', 'be', 'involved', 'filming', '6th', 'Man', 'are', 'Jim', 'Harrick', 'Jerry', 'Tarkanian', 'Nolan', 'Richardson', 'Jim', 'Harrick', 'resume', 'NCAA', 'violations', 'very', 'lengthy', 'academic', 'fraud', 'improper', 'benefits', 'lying', 'investigators', 'illegal', 'recruiting', 'Next', 'Jerry', 'Tarkanian', 'famous', 'recruiting', 'point', 'shaving', 'scandals', 'Finally', 'Nolan', 'Richardson', 'may', 'have', 'not', 'cheated', 'son', 'certainly', 'did', 'commit', 'many', 'NCAA', 'violations', 'also', 'brandished', 'gun', 'assistant', 'coach', 'basketball', 'practice', 'So', 'much', 'father', 'son', 'theory', 'Now', 'just', 'have', 'one', 'simple', 'question', 'why', 'did', 'University', 'Washington', 'agree', 'lend', 'name', 'film', 'condoned', 'cheating', 'So', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'Obviously', 'ending', 'film', 'predictable', 'So', 'why', 'bother', 'sitting', 'anyway', '6th', 'Man', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'made']",N/A
736262,A3JCP5X8XKGA08,B00008979C,Brad Smith,"[1, 2]","This movie was great back in the day man. Just like so many other movies that I get off amazon or from wherever, I used to watch this and never get tired of it. This is a story of two brothers, Antoine Tyler(Kadeem Hardison) & Kenny Tyler(Marlon Wayans) whos lives are centered around being college basketball stars. Brothers who love and care for one another and that have been through everything togeather. Including their father dying & their rise to the NCAA with college team The Huskies. Things take a turn for the worse when Antoine(Hardison) takes it to the hole for a big jam and looses his breath after the dunk. He falls flat back on the ground and the game is delayed. His brother Kenny(Wayans) immediantly comes to his aid and finds out that Antoine is going to the hospital. He wanted to go with him but Antione said no, stay here and finish. 'I'll be back.' Kenney and the Huskies suffer a defeat and Kenney rushes to the locker room to pack up and go to the hospital only to find out his brother died on the way there by his coach and he is devastated. Though the Huskies continue on, they just keep losing and losing every game and can't seem to win without Antoine. In an empty stadium one night Kenny drops his bags and talks to his deceased brother. Saying he can't do it without him and that they need him. This truly teary-eyed tale continues on with his brother returning as the ghostly 'Sixth Man' as he and his brother reunite and the Huskies pick up their game intensly. There are many hilarious scenes of Antoine messing with Kenny such as him going on a date. Only Kenny can see him so it just makes it that much greater. I don't wanna spoil anything else so yea just use your imagination. Wayans is the perfect guy for this and when its all said and done and they say their goodbyes you can't help but shed a tear with the great acting. If your a fan of basketball or if you just want some good laughs and don't mind crying, this is definetly for you. A great movie and something you will definetly hold on to in your collection as of of the your favs.",5,The 6th Man: A comedic/loving triumph,1099872000,"11 8, 2004",2004,2081,"['movie', 'was', 'great', 'back', 'day', 'man', 'Just', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'get', 'off', 'amazon', 'wherever', 'used', 'watch', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'story', 'two', 'brothers', 'Antoine', 'Tyler', 'Kadeem', 'Hardison', 'Kenny', 'Tyler', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'whos', 'lives', 'are', 'centered', 'being', 'college', 'basketball', 'stars', 'Brothers', 'who', 'love', 'care', 'one', 'have', 'been', 'everything', 'togeather', 'Including', 'father', 'dying', 'rise', 'NCAA', 'college', 'team', 'Huskies', 'Things', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'when', 'Antoine', 'Hardison', 'hole', 'big', 'jam', 'breath', 'dunk', 'flat', 'back', 'ground', 'game', 'delayed', 'brother', 'Kenny', 'Wayans', 'immediantly', 'aid', 'out', 'Antoine', 'going', 'hospital', 'wanted', 'go', 'Antione', 'said', 'stay', 'here', 'finish', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'Kenney', 'Huskies', 'suffer', 'defeat', 'Kenney', 'rushes', 'locker', 'room', 'pack', 'up', 'go', 'hospital', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'brother', 'died', 'way', 'there', 'coach', 'devastated', 'Huskies', 'continue', 'just', 'keep', 'losing', 'losing', 'game', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'win', 'Antoine', 'empty', 'stadium', 'one', 'night', 'Kenny', 'bags', 'talks', 'deceased', 'brother', 'Saying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'need', 'truly', 'teary-eyed', 'tale', 'brother', 'returning', 'ghostly', ""'Sixth"", 'Man', 'brother', 'reunite', 'Huskies', 'pick', 'up', 'game', 'intensly', 'are', 'many', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'Antoine', 'messing', 'Kenny', 'such', 'going', 'date', 'Only', 'Kenny', 'can', 'see', 'so', 'just', 'much', 'greater', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'spoil', 'anything', 'else', 'so', 'yea', 'just', 'use', 'imagination', 'Wayans', 'perfect', 'guy', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'say', 'goodbyes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'shed', 'tear', 'great', 'acting', 'fan', 'basketball', 'just', 'want', 'good', 'laughs', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'crying', 'definetly', 'great', 'movie', 'something', 'will', 'definetly', 'hold', 'collection', 'favs']",N/A

Anderson ""sma331""","[4, 6]","This is a touching comedy starring Kadeem Hardison (A Different World), and Marlon Wayans (In Living Color, The Wayans Brothers).  Kenny(Wayans) and Antoine(Hardison) are brothers who have been through everything together.  Including the death of their beloved father who taught them ""You can get through anything if you stick together"".  They play for the same college basketball team, The Huskies.  A&K; all the way is their battle cry, and they play well off of each other with Antoine being the star player.  During a game Antoine goes down, and he has to be rushed to the hospital.  Kenny tries to rush to the hospital after the game, but finds out that Antoine dies.  Kenny has to go on with is life without his brother and it's not easy.  At one point he prays and he tells his late brother how much he needs him in his life.  Strange but funny things start to happen.  After a game win Kenny is hugging his brother, everyone is looking at him like he has totally flipped. To cover it up he claims he is hugging himself.The gym scene in the movie is hilarious.  Kenny gets beat up real bad.  He is tossed around and his friends think he has lost it.  Kenny convinces Antoine to show him self so his friends don't cart him off to the loony farm.  Antoine does some magical stuff and the whole team realizes that Kenny is not crazy.  Now that Antoine is back so to say, the team starts playing a lot better.  Three point shots usually missed are always going in. Danny is able to dunk, and the team keeps winning games.  Even the team mascot is able to make one of his trick shots thanks to Antoine.RC is asked to write story and the strange things going on to advance her career.  She gets close to Kenny.  Kenny and reporter RC (Michael Michele ) start to date, but Antoine keeps sabatoging things.  He makes Kenny put steak sauce on his salmon, and prevents Kenny from kissing RC good night. Kenny was the sidekick of the team and he does not want to do it anymore.  Antoine has taken over and Kenny wants his shot to prove to himself he can do it, and even though he misses Antoine, he knows he has to let his brother go.  Antoine is a ball hog.  The team even have their own Dennis Rodman, Zigi is always doing something with his hair.  The team is able to win finally win a game, and Antoine leaves his brother behind in a scene that still makes me cry to this day.  I liked the special lighting they used on Antoine to give him a ghost like appearance.The movie also stars Orr Lorenzo as Malik, Chris Spencer as Jimmy Stubbs, David Paymer  Coach Pederson(who reminds me of Jeff Van Gundy), Dick Vitale, Bill Walton, John Tompson,This is a great movie the whole family can watch together and enjoy.
