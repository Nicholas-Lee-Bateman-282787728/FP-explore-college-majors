I can relate somewhat to the main character but it is certainly not entertaining or a ""feel good"" movie. I doubt I will ever want to watch this one again. It fell way short of it's potential.

Fox believes in his luck and strikes it rich by winning 500,000 marks in the lottery and very soon attracts the attention of an elegant, posh, and sophisticated Eugen who knows very well how to make Fox pay for his expensive habits and how to make him invest a lot of money in his father business that is not very successful to say the least. What fascinated me the most - how convincingly Fassbinder - one man production company who came up with the idea, wrote the screenplay and directed the movie- played seemingly tough but as it turned, confused and vulnerable Fox. Another interesting aspect of the movie is the way Fassbinder describes the gay community in Germany of the early 70s.

699570,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000065AZ9,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Rainer Werner Fassbinder has long been honored as the 'bad boy' in European cinema, a writer/director/actor who repeatedly has taken chances and because of his brutal honesty has succeeded in making a stream of important films. FOX AND HIS FRIENDS dates back to 1975 and remains one of Fassbinder's most successful films. As with all of his films, Fassbinder deals with the homosexual subculture in Germany but his main message goes far beyond the characters he creates: the examination of how people manipulate people for personal gain and the destruction that produces is a recurring problem and one that this film certainly explores.'Fox' - a nickname of Franz Bieberkopf - (acted with consummate skill by Fassbinder himself) is a lower class gay carny kid whose lover is arrested, leaving the carnival to collapse and leaving Fox without support. Enter handsome Max (Karlheinz B&ouml;hm), a wealthy antiques dealer, who picks up Fox, helps him buy the requisite 'lottery ticket' on which Fox bases his hopes for financial survival (!) via manipulative means, and takes him home, introducing Fox to his gay friends who regard Fox as scum but show obvious physical attraction to his rawness. Surprisingly Fox wins the lottery and suddenly has 500,000 DMs and with his new money, Max's friends abruptly see a target for obtaining that money. One of the friends named Eugen (Peter Chatel) takes Fox in as a lover and talks him into investing in Eugen's family business of bookbinding. Eugen's father Wolf (Adrian Hoven) and mother (Ulla Jacobsson) tolerate their son's life with a low class wretch, ridiculing his manners and lack of culture and education, but willingly take his money to salvage their business.With a lover and a business and a role model to make him suave, Fox dons fancy clothes, banters with his old friends in a tawdry club, and makes the pretenses that at last he is secure and happy. But in time Fox is blamed for problems at the business and when his funds have been depleted on expensive vacations and apartments by the smarmy self-centered Eugen, Fox realizes that now without money he has no 'fancy friends', no lover, no security and his life becomes unbearable: the ending to the film is a tragedy beyond description.Some would say the film is mannered in ways that depict stereotypes of the gay world (effeminate men, transvestites, opportunists, hustlers, etc), but Fassbinder is completely honest in his attempt to recreate a subculture of a specific time in Germany. And the characters are well written and well acted allowing us to look at Fassbinder's greater picture of depravity between social class antipathies. In many ways this is a difficult film to watch, but Fassbinder wisely places the main character that he enacts in a place where his foibles and lack of higher-class knowledge can be at once very humorous as well as pitiable. FOX AND HIS FRIENDS has some minor flaws but it has already become a classic in gay cinema repertoire. In German with English subtitles.

699571,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B000065AZ9,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[1, 1]","This is one of Fassbinder's best films, a really incisive, sad, and pointed commentary on class differences and exploitation.  Fox, wonderfully played by Fassbinder himself, is a lower class carnival worker who wins the lottery, and is welcomed (or seduced) into the upper class gay culture.  He naively and sadly believes that they genuinely like him, but they are just using him for his money.  He essentially is used by the upper class until his money runs out.  They jettison him, like an abattoir does with the carcases of cows.Many have made hay of the fact that the main character here is homosexual.  There weren't too many films at the time about homosexuality, but the strange thing is that Fox's sexual orientation really doesn't matter here.  The film is about class and class exploitation, not sexual orientation.  It never becomes a ""gay"" film.  It is a human film, showing that (shock!) homosexuals can succumb to greed, cruelty, coldness, and indifference like everyone else can.  I always find films that show ""minorities"" (for lack of a better term) as deeply human and flawed, because it shows that they are just as human as the so-called ""majorities"" are.  It is the polar opposite of political correctness, which serves to dumb us down and makes us all the same.  I prefer the polar opposite.  It is refreshing and much more though provoking than bland, PC portrayals.This is a very sad film.  Even in high school (when I first saw this), I was really moved by it.  I adore Fassbinder.  I think he's one of the greatest directors that Germany ever produced.

699572,A3RAWQSWAC7BWD,B000065AZ9,J. Clark,"[26, 28]","FOX AND HIS FRIENDS is one of Fassbinder's most poignant and accessible works. The story and performances are direct, and the look of the film is polished. Yet it also deals powerfully with some of his central themes, such of the search for love, and exploitation in its many forms (both homosexual and heterosexual). Wellspring Media has released a pristine DVD of the film, from a carefully restored print. If offers both a vivid new Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, as well as the original stereo, plus filmographies and Web links.Fassbinder is very effective at shattering, or at least twisting, stereotypes in his films, whether they concern people from a ""different"" class (MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS), race (ALI: FEAR EATS THE SOUL), age (MOTHER KUSTERS GOES TO HEAVEN), or physical ability (CHINESE ROULETTE). In FOX AND HIS FRIENDS he focuses on homosexual men, in one of the first films ever to depict their lives - warts and all - as complex lived experience. (Of course, in the years since FOX's 1975 release, film has come a long way in exploring the diversity of homosexual experience.) Fassbinder made only a handful of other films dealing with homosexual, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) people: 1972's THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT, 1978's IN A YEAR OF 13 MOONS, and 1982's QUERELLE. All are worth seeing, and each remains among his most controversial works.Since some people consider FOX to be homophobic, it's worth noting that there are perhaps as many unscrupulous straight characters (including Fox's new lover's mother and father - who swindle him for the ""noble"" purpose of keeping open their business, which employs 70 people) as homosexual ones. Also, Fox's bar buddies include several caring and likable homosexual and transgender characters, who represent a diversity of ages, body types, and demeanors (some are ""straight-acting,"" others love to camp it up). And Fassbinder, in his most demanding role as an actor, gives his most nuanced performance. There are many complex layers to Franz ""Fox"" Biberkopf, and Fassbinder explores them all, from street-smarts to sweetness to pain to defiance to despair, and more.When I first saw FOX, I was horrified by the final scene (although it is vintage Fassbinder). Now, after watching it again, I have to wonder if the film actually ends inside Fox's mind (for his sake, I hope so). That metro/subway stop is unnaturally - eerily - clean and quiet. Everything is blue and white, even the clothes worn by all the characters who pass through. Yet this comes at the end of one of Fassbinder's most naturalistic films; nothing earlier is as stylized. So, is this just a nightmare vision? (But as a friend noted, if you are going to include one dream state in a film - and make it the final scene - be sure the audience understands the ambiguity.) Has Fox learned, from his devastating experiences, that the glitzy ""lifestyle"" he has just lost was what was destroying him? So maybe - just maybe - Fox is ready to begin putting himself back together... if the final scene is just a nightmare.",5,Powerful film & excellent DVD transfer,1028678400,"08 7, 2002",2002,3060,"['FOX', 'HIS', 'FRIENDS', 'one', 'Fassbinder', 'most', 'poignant', 'accessible', 'works', 'story', 'performances', 'are', 'direct', 'look', 'film', 'polished', 'also', 'powerfully', 'central', 'themes', 'such', 'search', 'love', 'exploitation', 'many', 'forms', 'homosexual', 'heterosexual', 'Wellspring', 'Media', 'released', 'pristine', 'DVD', 'film', 'carefully', 'restored', 'print', 'offers', 'both', 'vivid', 'new', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'stereo', 'filmographies', 'Web', 'links.Fassbinder', 'very', 'effective', 'shattering', 'least', 'twisting', 'stereotypes', 'films', 'concern', 'people', 'different', 'class', 'MERCHANT', 'OF', 'FOUR', 'SEASONS', 'race', 'ALI', 'FEAR', 'THE', 'SOUL', 'age', 'MOTHER', 'KUSTERS', 'GOES', 'TO', 'HEAVEN', 'physical', 'ability', 'CHINESE', 'ROULETTE', 'FOX', 'AND', 'HIS', 'FRIENDS', 'homosexual', 'men', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'ever', 'depict', 'lives', 'warts', 'complex', 'lived', 'experience', 'course', 'years', 'FOX', '1975', 'release', 'film', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'exploring', 'diversity', 'homosexual', 'experience', 'Fassbinder', 'made', 'only', 'handful', 'other', 'films', 'dealing', 'homosexual', 'lesbian', 'bisexual', 'transgender', 'GLBT', 'people', '1972', 'THE', 'BITTER', 'TEARS', 'OF', 'PETRA', 'VON', 'KANT', '1978', 'IN', 'A', 'YEAR', '13', 'MOONS', '1982', 'QUERELLE', 'are', 'worth', 'seeing', 'most', 'controversial', 'works.Since', 'people', 'consider', 'FOX', 'be', 'homophobic', 'worth', 'noting', 'are', 'perhaps', 'many', 'unscrupulous', 'straight', 'characters', 'including', 'Fox', 'new', 'lover', 'mother', 'father', 'who', 'swindle', 'noble', 'purpose', 'keeping', 'open', 'business', '70', 'people', 'homosexual', 'ones', 'Also', 'Fox', 'bar', 'buddies', 'include', 'several', 'caring', 'likable', 'homosexual', 'transgender', 'characters', 'who', 'represent', 'diversity', 'ages', 'body', 'types', 'demeanors', 'are', 'straight-acting', 'others', 'love', 'camp', 'up', 'Fassbinder', 'most', 'demanding', 'role', 'actor', 'most', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'are', 'many', 'complex', 'layers', 'Franz', 'Fox', 'Biberkopf', 'Fassbinder', 'street-smarts', 'sweetness', 'pain', 'defiance', 'despair', 'more.When', 'first', 'saw', 'FOX', 'was', 'horrified', 'final', 'scene', 'vintage', 'Fassbinder', 'Now', 'watching', 'again', 'have', 'wonder', 'film', 'actually', 'inside', 'Fox', 'mind', 'sake', 'hope', 'so', 'metro/subway', 'stop', 'unnaturally', 'eerily', 'clean', 'quiet', 'Everything', 'blue', 'white', 'even', 'clothes', 'worn', 'characters', 'who', 'pass', 'end', 'one', 'Fassbinder', 'most', 'naturalistic', 'films', 'nothing', 'earlier', 'stylized', 'So', 'just', 'nightmare', 'vision', 'friend', 'noted', 'are', 'going', 'include', 'one', 'dream', 'state', 'film', 'make', 'final', 'scene', 'be', 'sure', 'audience', 'ambiguity', 'Fox', 'learned', 'devastating', 'experiences', 'glitzy', 'lifestyle', 'just', 'lost', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'destroying', 'So', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'Fox', 'ready', 'begin', 'putting', 'back', 'together', 'final', 'scene', 'just', 'nightmare']",N/A

He finds many who are willing to be bought.  They use him and abuse him, all the while mocking him.  As he begins his downward spiral they all turn against him, except his supposedly low-life friends at his favorite gay bar.The film is very well made and very well acted.  It is not about gay vs. straight, or upper class vs. lower class, or any group vs. any other group.  Rather It is about the corrupting and often toxic allure of money.  As such it is a very powerful work, but distinctly painful to watch.
