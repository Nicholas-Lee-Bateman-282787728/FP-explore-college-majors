A hero from late 20th century Earth is found buried in an early experiment for cryo-sleep.  The experiment was disrupted by a sudden fault break.  What happens next is amazing.  He somehow survives through long decades and his rescue party arrives.  They look almost like people of his time, but they aren't.  He realizes gradually that it is a much different time and Earth has changed.  He is what seems ""rescued"" to go to a glorius civilization on a mountain ridge.  But there is hidden dysfunction in this new ""paradise"".  Now the plot really begins and through many twists and turns ... you'll see.  If you like Star Trek and Star Trek NG you will very much like this.  It seems like it might have well been the Pilot for a new series that somehow never got into production.  I wonder why?  It would have been good.  Roddenberry was also very good at having women in strong roles.  He way have started it back in the late 1960's.  He had a very optimistic yet realistic vision of where our societies would evolve to.  Equality, non-violent to a large degree, and very adaptable and intelligent.  Sexual and Racial Equality.  The only reason I did not rate this a 5 was the acting to a small degree and the lack of special effects.  I have grown so used to technology that the future in this very good story is dated today.  If I set this aside then I would have given this about a 4.3  Liked it very much.

1291365,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B002VA5A02,Brent Butler,"[2, 2]","Set in a future where a nuclear war has decimated the population and left mutants, barbarism, and an uneven survival of technology, Genesis II was a pilot concept that opened up a lot of room for weekly adventures. Unfortunately, this pilot was not picked up, even thought it generated enough interest to be tried twice more! So we have a limited stock of the adventures of Dylan Hunt ... a scientist of the past living in an uneven world of tomorrow.One of the reasons that we remember this so well so long after its initial broadcast has to be the beautiful Mariette Hartley. Roddenberry had fought the censors over his costumes for the ladies on Star Trek, with one of the proscriptions being that he could not show their navels! By the time he made Genesis II the standards had relaxed, and he sought his revenge by showing Mariette Hartley with not one, but TWO belly buttons. LOL She looked great with any number of belly buttons, and Roddenberry successfully cultivated the teen fantasies that Genesis II was designed to tap into.Alex Cord looked great in the role and carried the right amount of ""Kirk-like"" stubbornness, although his acting was a bit stiff in places. His voiceovers sounded a bit more like the tough guy than the thoughtful scientist, but he worked in the role anyway. The network execs may have had the same quibbles I did, as he was replaced in the two follow-up pilots by John Saxon.The societies depicted here are not very subtle. It is the struggle of Pax (peace) versus Tyrania (tyranny). Hunt, who was discovered trapped in a suspended animation experiment gone wrong, is pulled back and forth between the two, each hoping that his expertise can help their side, or at the least not aid the other.Sets and costuming here were minimal, with the most effort probably going into the set depicting an underground tube station of the future. Still, it was an enjoyable show and worth a look. I'd recommend trying this out on the low priced rental before paying the big bucks for the DVD.For those of us who saw this air in the 70s, it is worth a look for old times sake.

Lane,"[8, 11]","Gene Roddenberry chose deceit as a storyteller; not only did he allow the viewer to believe that the sympathetic Marriete Hartley was a goodguy (goodgal?) but he also showed us that a socialist scheme (look at the poor hungry people living here in the tunnels that PAX, the authority figure, lets starve so that they can have EVERYTHING) from Hartley can be quite seductive, especially when the scheme spouts bogus concerns for the downtrodden and a hot chick hopping into bed with you; PAX smax, this good has to right!; but Dylan soon learns that Hartley's BS is merely to get his help to enslave the folks at PAX; Hartley is actually a sleazy monarchist that has forced people into slavery with a wand that provides pain and pleasure to control behavior a la Dr. Pavlov. Soon Dylan realizes his mistake into thinking that he has awaken into some near-perfect Utopia when, in fact, its just another failed Dystopia. Roddenberry played with patriotism, Communism, Socialism and corrupted utopias throughout his career (Star Trek being the most obvious); like H. G. Wells before him, Roddenberry dreamed of a world where everyone's needs came first, but he was adult and intelligent enough to know that the individual should never surrender his rights to government entities; you can't trust that anyone has your best interests at heart because it is power that matters to them, power over the individual.

Within this story, Mariette Hartley plays a half-breed Mutant living amongst the Pax and trying to earn the trust of Hunt, who struggles with her own identity and is constant conflict with her emotions (towards Hunt)and to which side she ultimately owes her allegiance.Regarding Alex Cord as the choice of Dylan Hunt, this was odd casting.  Roddenberry usually picked his leads well but not this time.  Cord was one of the few actors that always annoyed/irritated me in other roles and came off to me consistently as a real wise ass, complete with annoying facial reactions.  He certainly doesn't fit the role of a Scientist, even an action-oriented one and perhaps this is why they went with John Saxon in the ""Planet Earth"" Sequel to this story.  (also available on DVD via Amazon by the way and worth checking out...)Of interest to Star Trek Fans, are several actors who popped up on the Original ST Series either as semi-regulars or guest stars. Roddenberry's wife and widow, Majel Barrett, best known as Nurse Chapel on the Original Star Trek Series, appears here in a minor role and Ted Cassidy has a more substantial part and also appears in the ""Planet Earth"" Sequel.  Cassidy  played an ominous looking over-sized android in the ST Episode ""What are Little Girls Made of"", which ironically also featured Nurse Chapel in one of her few Major parts in a Star Trek Episode. Percy Rodrigues, one of the key leaders of the ""Pax"" in this story, appeared in the ST Episode ""Court Martial"".
