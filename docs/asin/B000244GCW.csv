824064,A12P84EGJD4JVX,B000244GCW,Edith Biggar,"[1, 1]","I am a collector.  I collect many kinds of things.  One thing I collect is Hallmark Hall of Fame movies.  Let me begin this review by telling you NOWHERE is this fact noted!  There was a time when Hallmark movies were only broadcast & if a person missed its broadcast, well tough!  Other companies owned the rights of distribution.  I am grateful to report that is no longer the truth.  From at least year 2000, if you want to get a Hallmark movie, they can be ordered directly from Hallmark's web-site & sometimes, found in Hallmark retail stores.Now, about the movie - I agree with the reviewers who cite the casting choices of John Lithgow, Morgan Freeman & CCH Pounder.  This movie is set in 1972.  I was in junior high school then!  I remember accounts of the war in Vietnam being broadcast on the evening news.  Racial discrimination was illegal by then.  Classrooms, even in the Deep-South were integrated, although many people didn't like it.  The police chief of this small town of Rockville, GA met the funeral party for LT Johnson at the entrance of the cemetary & would not let the casket be buried in the town cemetary, because, citing a law that said ""within the town boudaries of Rockville, only the remains or cremains of caucasians could be buried therin.""  Imagine the humiliation of the mourners to have to take the casket back to the church until the matter could be resolved!  Then, the character of Major Kendall Laird goes to work to try to get this man's body buried.  This fallen Lieutenant was an exceptional man his entire maturing life.  He got good grades in school & many other charitable deeds.  Then, he joined the Army & got sent to Vietnam to command a mostly white unit.  After he died, his unit put him up for a Silver Star.  Maj. Laird tries to sift through the stories of the men who served under Lt. Johnson.  I won't spoil the surprise event that changes the stroy-line for you.  Get the movie & watch it, especially if you are a fan of ""who-done-it"" & why.  There is real ""chemistry"" between the three main actors in this film.Since this was a Hallmark Hall of Fame production, several things will remain constant & are true in this film as well.  First, it will start with a good story; and this is a good story.  It is a small slice of time (how long, I can't say, but the body lied in state in the church - maybe a course of a few days).  It is times to air in a 120 minute time slot - minus about 30-40 minutes for commercials.  Generally, casting included at least one well-known name; although there are some exceptions to this rule.  The sets will be realistic, and can be anywhere in the world.  There is little swearing, little blood-shed, little violence.  If the story requires these, the exposure will be at a bare minimum or addressed in dialog.  Many movies are made by the parent company of Hallmark Entertainment, but generally only three a year will earn the Hallmark Hall of Fame designation.  These are ""hallmarks"" of a great production.  I now own as much of the collection as is available in home-video formats of VHS & DVD.  Many are the ""Gold Crown Editions"".  (These have some special features that are not available in ""street copies"").  One of those special features is something they call ""The Making of ......"" featurette.  This is a smaller added feature that included some behind the scenes in shooting, interivews with the director, producer & cast as well as how the setting was chosen for outdoor shots.This particular recording is what the Hallmark people call a ""street copy"".  It is just the movie.  You can go to particular scenes, but that is the only feature you can do with this version.  This recording is very clean.  I say this because it is generally my habit to set one of our VHS VCRs to record off-air, HHofF movies when they are broadcast.  Generally, at some point later, I will purchase the commercial version of the film.  Of course, that means I will get all the commercials too.  This movies oes seamlessly from scene to scene & the picture quality is very good.Bottom line - would I recommend this film to others?  Oh YES!  Fefinately Yes!  It is my hope with more people viewing this film now, prejudice that happened in the 1970's will not continue occur in 2011 & beyond.",5,One small town's prejudice against burying a Vietnam hero in an all-white cemetary,1309996800,"07 7, 2011",2011,4269,"['am', 'collector', 'collect', 'many', 'kinds', 'things', 'One', 'thing', 'collect', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'movies', 'Let', 'begin', 'review', 'telling', 'NOWHERE', 'fact', 'noted', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'Hallmark', 'movies', 'were', 'only', 'broadcast', 'person', 'missed', 'broadcast', 'well', 'tough', 'Other', 'companies', 'owned', 'rights', 'distribution', 'am', 'grateful', 'report', 'no', 'longer', 'truth', 'least', 'year', '2000', 'want', 'get', 'Hallmark', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'ordered', 'directly', 'Hallmark', 'web-site', 'sometimes', 'found', 'Hallmark', 'retail', 'stores.Now', 'movie', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'cite', 'casting', 'choices', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'CCH', 'Pounder', 'movie', 'set', '1972', 'was', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'then', 'remember', 'accounts', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'being', 'broadcast', 'evening', 'news', 'Racial', 'discrimination', 'was', 'illegal', 'then', 'Classrooms', 'even', 'Deep-South', 'were', 'integrated', 'many', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'police', 'chief', 'small', 'town', 'Rockville', 'GA', 'met', 'funeral', 'party', 'LT', 'Johnson', 'entrance', 'cemetary', 'would', 'not', 'let', 'casket', 'be', 'buried', 'town', 'cemetary', 'citing', 'law', 'said', 'town', 'boudaries', 'Rockville', 'only', 'remains', 'cremains', 'caucasians', 'could', 'be', 'buried', 'therin', 'humiliation', 'mourners', 'have', 'take', 'casket', 'back', 'church', 'matter', 'could', 'be', 'resolved', 'Then', 'character', 'Major', 'Kendall', 'Laird', 'work', 'try', 'get', 'man', 'body', 'buried', 'fallen', 'Lieutenant', 'was', 'exceptional', 'man', 'entire', 'maturing', 'life', 'got', 'good', 'grades', 'school', 'many', 'other', 'charitable', 'deeds', 'Then', 'joined', 'Army', 'got', 'sent', 'Vietnam', 'command', 'mostly', 'white', 'unit', 'died', 'unit', 'put', 'up', 'Silver', 'Star', 'Maj.', 'Laird', 'sift', 'stories', 'men', 'who', 'served', 'Lt.', 'Johnson', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'surprise', 'event', 'stroy-line', 'Get', 'movie', 'watch', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', 'who-done-it', 'why', 'real', 'chemistry', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'film.Since', 'was', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'production', 'several', 'things', 'will', 'remain', 'constant', 'are', 'true', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'First', 'will', 'start', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'story', 'small', 'slice', 'time', 'how', 'long', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'body', 'lied', 'state', 'church', 'maybe', 'course', 'few', 'days', 'times', 'air', '120', 'minute', 'time', 'slot', 'minus', '30-40', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'Generally', 'casting', 'included', 'least', 'one', 'well-known', 'name', 'are', 'exceptions', 'rule', 'sets', 'will', 'be', 'realistic', 'can', 'be', 'anywhere', 'world', 'little', 'swearing', 'little', 'blood-shed', 'little', 'violence', 'story', 'exposure', 'will', 'be', 'bare', 'minimum', 'addressed', 'dialog', 'Many', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'parent', 'company', 'Hallmark', 'Entertainment', 'generally', 'only', 'three', 'year', 'will', 'earn', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'designation', 'are', 'hallmarks', 'great', 'production', 'now', 'own', 'as', 'much', 'collection', 'available', 'home-video', 'formats', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'are', 'Gold', 'Crown', 'Editions', 'have', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'not', 'available', 'street', 'copies', 'One', 'special', 'features', 'something', 'call', 'Making', 'featurette', 'smaller', 'added', 'feature', 'included', 'scenes', 'shooting', 'director', 'producer', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'setting', 'was', 'chosen', 'outdoor', 'shots.This', 'particular', 'recording', 'what', 'Hallmark', 'people', 'call', 'street', 'copy', 'just', 'movie', 'can', 'go', 'particular', 'scenes', 'only', 'feature', 'can', 'do', 'version', 'recording', 'very', 'clean', 'say', 'generally', 'habit', 'set', 'one', 'VHS', 'VCRs', 'record', 'off-air', 'HHofF', 'movies', 'when', 'are', 'broadcast', 'Generally', 'point', 'later', 'will', 'purchase', 'commercial', 'version', 'film', 'course', 'will', 'get', 'commercials', 'too', 'movies', 'seamlessly', 'scene', 'scene', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'good.Bottom', 'line', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'others', 'Oh', 'YES', 'Fefinately', 'Yes', 'hope', 'more', 'people', 'viewing', 'film', 'now', 'prejudice', 'happened', '1970', 'will', 'not', 'continue', 'occur', '2011']",Resting Place

Someone also was critical of Lithgow's acting in this film but, if you put it in the perspective of where the army stood with its own segregation issues during the Vietnam War era, I think the reticence Lithgow portrayed was right on point.The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 was because the cinematography was very poor. It was like watching a rerun of a 1960's tv drama. But I'm glad I bought the movie and would buy it again.",4,A Slice of History,1399420800,"05 7, 2014",2014,1116,"[""'m"", 'bit', 'history', 'buff', 'especially', '20th', 'century', 'American', 'history', 'so', 'perspective', 'liked', 'gave', 'thought-provoking', 'look', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'decades', 'expected', 'young', 'black', 'men', 'die', 'defending', ""'principles"", 'nation', 'affording', 'full', 'civil', 'rights.It', 'was', 'particularly', ""'thought-provoking"", 'wanted', 'update', 'story', 'line', 'could', 'replace', 'black', 'family', 'undocumented', 'immigrant', 'family', ""'whites"", 'only', 'cemetery', ""'citizens"", 'only', 'cemetery', 'date', '2014.As', 'fan', 'Lithgow', 'Freeman', 'was', 'added', 'bonus', 'however', 'someone', 'else', 'noted', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'part', 'was', 'relatively', 'small', 'Someone', 'also', 'was', 'critical', 'Lithgow', 'acting', 'film', 'put', 'perspective', 'where', 'army', 'stood', 'own', 'segregation', 'issues', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'era', 'think', 'reticence', 'Lithgow', 'portrayed', 'was', 'right', 'point.The', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'was', 'cinematography', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'was', 'watching', 'rerun', '1960', 'tv', 'drama', ""'m"", 'glad', 'bought', 'movie', 'would', 'buy', 'again']",Resting Place
