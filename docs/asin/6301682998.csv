Of all performance, I think Ron Silver's stood out the most despite the fact that Anjelica Huston and Lena Olin were nominated. The story is what kept the film together because I haven't seen a similar kind in another film. It's a unique aspect about it. There are times that the characters are quite funny. Of course, what's interesting about keeping it in perspective that all of them were Holocaust survivors. So, it is quite difficult to judge the man's moral values because most likely, he is just confused. I like the 40's feel about the film, and it works.

The Nazis severely damaged the stable relationships of many European Jews. Herman Broder (Ron Silver) has emigrated to New York. His wife (Anjelica Huston) is presumed dead and he feels an obligation to serve as a husband to the woman (Margaret Sophie Stein) who previously was the family housekeeper. She is attractive enough and well meaning, but dumber than the proverbial door nail. Herman is also having a passionate affair with a woman who hasn't quite divorced her own husband. Can things get any more complicated? The answer to this question is a resounding yes. It turns out the original wife is still among the living. What can be done? Somebody is obviously going to get hurt. Who will it be? A saintly man would be desperate to find a morally and pragmatic solution---and Herman is not even close to being a saint. Might he wish to get advice from his rabbi (Alan King)? This particular religious leader, sadly, is not exactly a paragon of virtue. He is only a step away from being a total rogue. Alas, Herman inevitably seems doomed to make matters even worse. Isaac Bashevis Singer's story is filled with much humor and pathos. The well known post 9/11 blogger Roger L.

They must have had a different copy.  But the film itself remains as fresh and exciting as when it first was issued.  Mazursky captures the spirit (if not all the nuances) of I. B. Singer's marvelous novel about Holocaust survivors in New York in the 1950s.  None of the reviewers here seem either to have read the book or really understood the point of the film -- Herman Broder, ghost writer, who was hidden during the war by the Polish servant who saved him and marries her (Jadwiga), finds passion with Masha, who survived the camps with her mother (Eros and Thanatos certainly go together here), and discovers his first wife (Tamara), who was shot with her children by the Einsatzgruppen and left for dead, is actually alive.  Each represents a different facet of the catastrophe, conveniently divided among the New York boroughs.  Anyone, by the way, who has read anything of Singer, including this book, would recognize his very typical take on male sexuality.

261988,A2X25C107CSLOR,6301682998,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[6, 17]","It's revealing to compare director Paul Mazursky's adaptation of a book by Isaac Bashevis Singer, with Barbra Streisand's Yentl, also based on a I B Singer story. In spite of the author's objection to Streisand making her title &quot;a film with music&quot;, at least her version retained Singer's sly wit. Regrettably Mazursky has drained all the humour out of his effort, with the music score by Maurice Jarre a promise of what we never get.Part of the problem is Ron Silver as the main character, a man with a wife, a mistress, and then a former wife back from the dead, in 1949 New York. This is a delicious comic premise, but Silver is both humourless and unlikeable. Mazursky doesn't make it easy for him, particularly when our first sight of him is hiding from Nazis and allowing his wife to be beaten. The treatment gives Silver guilty visions but even these can't redeem him, so when the focus rests on his tortured preference for the temperamental mistress, we're bogged in sadomasochism. This may be very Jewish, but it's also awfully hard to watch. And Mazurksy's metaphor of the Coney Island ferris world, which Silver repeatedly looks to, falls flat, mainly because the wheel is always still.Thank goodness for Angelica Huston as the former wife. She has a Garbo-like presence, and it helps that she's not like either the mousy wife or the sex pot mistress. She gets to deliver the best lines, including &quot; If every man had his way, every woman would lie down a prostitute and get up a virgin&quot;, and &quot;A slit throat cannot be sewn together again&quot;.  She also gets that melodramatic standby, the scene of laughing/crying, but she pulls it off. The scene where she visits Silver and his new wife, the Polish Margaret Sophie Stein, who was Huston's old world servant, is probably the best realised in Singer-tone, even if Mazursky has Stein's screaming at believing Huston is a ghost go on too long. Stein gets a payoff laugh though when there is a second knock at the door and she runs off again in fear.Alan King doesn't have much to do as a rabbi who Silver works for, but he does get to demonstrate the symbols of Jewish assimiliation - a goy wife and a black maid. Plus I like Phil Leedes as the man who exposes Silver's duplicity, even if the scene is disappointing. Leedes gets a funny line in response to King's re Silver &quot;I thought you were a eunich&quot; - &quot;I wish I was such a eunuch&quot;.My low opinion of this film is unusual, since it received favourable reviews. You can read Pauline Kael's more laudable one in her Movie Love collection, though even she admits that Mazurksy's restraint here is surprising.

He has written fine screenplays and this adaptation was honored by the Academy. As many adaptations of complicated books, and in this case a book by a very complex writer, there's questions after the viewing.  A story of Holocaust immigrants, simple enough: this writer-intellectual-Jew-survivor has too many wives. Then it might be a farce of embarrassing discovery and sneaking about.  Since the wives and Ron Silver's character have endured unspeakable horror, there's plenty of post-trauma syndrome.  The lovers joke about sleeping with death camp guards.  There's that understated gallows humor.  The women claim to have kept their modesty under the circumstances, but I doubt it. It is difficult to tell if Simon softened the blow.  I'll have to read Singer's book to see how he handled it. (They say Singer wrote in Yiddish about a Polish Jewry that no longer existed during his lifetime, a lost world.)The steamy stuff, most of the bedroom scenes occurs with the attractive, Lena Olin.

It might sound run of the mill, but in fact it is a taut psychological drama with interesting characters set against post-war NYC.I have avoided spoilers in this summary to the extent possible.  Hermann, the survivor, appears to have returned to a normal life.  His wife, the Polish woman who saved his life, adores him and is adopting the Jewish religion.  He is finding good work as a writer in a thriving society.  However, it quickly becomes evident that there is a lot more to this man:  his sultry mistress, also a Holocaust survivor, is his great passion.  The pursuit of what he wants begins to exhaust him, but he keeps it all going, until his former wife re-surfaces and it all begins to unravel.  She is a ghost from the past, revealing that he is acting much as he did with her.  After much mistreatment, his simple wife realizes he is lying, there goes another relationship.  Finally, the weight of her life and disappointments affects the mistress as well, dealing the final blow to Hermann.What makes this film so good is the acting.  Silver is totally believable as the man whose craziness gets another, perhaps fatal, layer added by his Holocaust trauma.  Olin, the mistress, brings more mental illness into his life, something he hates and fears, yet can't live without.  Angelica Huston is perhaps best of all, bringing an entire environment with her in every phrase and gesture.

261991,AY8WZDYR79GFV,6301682998,Yasha Banana,"[3, 12]","Let's contrast the role played in this movie by Ron Silver, that of ""Herman Broder,"" with Fredo Corlieone of ""The Godfather.""Now, students, we all know what Fredo Corlieone was doing with those cocktail waitresses, don't we.  He was, what? -- that's right, all together now -- he was ""bangin' 'em two at a time.""NOw I bring this up, class, because Fredo Corlieone ""bangin' 'em two at a time"" is as nothing compared to what our boy Herman Broder is doing in ""Enemies, A Love Story.""  Ole Herman, Ron Silver his own self, is not only bangin' 'em, he's bangin' 'em ***three*** at a time.  And he's not just bangin' 'em three at a time, he's ROMANCIN' 'em three at a time. if that's not enough, he's  'em three at a time.Ho boy!  This is some feency-schmancy Romeo!It's not just a case of wham-bam,thank-you-ma'am.  Ron Silver (Herman Broder) is actually playing house with these three gals.But, the thing is, when does he have time to press his suit, eat a meal, have cup coffee?I'm not sure what the point of this movie is; is it a primer on on ""How To Be a Trigamist""?Other reviewers here have noted how poor the sound quality is on this DVD, and indeed they're correct.  But who needs to know from  sound quality when Fredo Corlieone, Hugh Hefner, Mickey Rooney, Tony Curtis and Aly Khan might as well be monks compared to super-schtupper Herman Broder.And what is Herman's appeal to each of these three women?  This we are never told.  For this a clue would be nice.Richard Gere -- now this is a nice Jewish boy that one maybe two girls would go for.  But Ron Silver?  Ron Silver???Ron Silver takes off his shirt in this movie.  But what? -- this is supposed to drive the women in the audience meshuga?Three dames.  And they're all for Ron Silver.  If that's a proper and just ratio, then Pee Wee Herman should have a freakin' harem.Johnny Weismueller, remember him, Tarzan -- he takes off his shirt, it's understandable, women swoon, Helen Reddy has a hot flash, what could be more natural.  But let's face it, Ron Silver is no Tarzan.  With Cheetah ok, he might have a chance, but nailing Maureen O'Sullivan (Jane), forget about it.Also, I lost the point of how the Holocaust relates to this story.  OK, Herman is a Holocaust survivor -- so from this he schtups everything in the tri-borough area?Of course, as noted, Paul Mazursky the director, throws in references to the Holocaust, but I can't believe that the Holocaust references in the Issac Bashevah Singer novel, upon which this movie is based, are as marginal and as unintelligible as they are in the movie.I haven't read Issac Bashevah Singer's novel but I trust that his story is more intelligently structured than this movie in that anyone with three names, Issac Bashevah Singer, has got to be smarter than anyone with two names, Paul Mazursky -- even though I forget how Issac spells his middle name, and I'm too upset by Herman Broder out-humping Fredo Corlieone (a paisan after all) to look it up.Listen, I don't want to know the denouement of these characters.  I don't want to know the point of this story, assuming it has one, which I couldn't find with a posse and three hands -- I want to know how Ron Silver can play hide the salami with three gals in three separate apartments in three different NYC boroughs.*Italians* are supposed to be great lovers, not a schnook like Ron Silver.  In fact, on behalf of every Italian male in the world I DEMAND a list of the vitamins Ron Silver takes, a copy of his diet and a dozen cases of Manischevitz wine -- which I'm also too upset to get the correct spelling of.Because even though, mathematically speaking, poor ragazzo Fredo  is ""one-behind"" Herman Broder, he should get respect.  He can handle things, he's smart.  Not like everyone says -- not dumb; smart and he should have respect.  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo off to do that!  Let Fredo take care of some Michael Mouse night club somewhere!  Send Fredo to schtup Sophie Tucker and Ma Kettle at the airport!Well, it ain't the way he wanted it!",2,*Three* at a time???,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,4029,"['Let', 'contrast', 'role', 'played', 'movie', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Herman', 'Broder', 'Fredo', 'Corlieone', 'Godfather', 'Now', 'students', 'know', 'what', 'Fredo', 'Corlieone', 'was', 'doing', 'cocktail', 'waitresses', 'do', ""n't"", 'was', 'what', 'right', 'together', 'now', 'was', 'bangin', 'two', 'time', 'NOw', 'bring', 'up', 'class', 'Fredo', 'Corlieone', 'bangin', 'two', 'time', 'nothing', 'compared', 'what', 'boy', 'Herman', 'Broder', 'doing', 'Enemies', 'A', 'Love', 'Story', 'Ole', 'Herman', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'own', 'self', 'not', 'only', 'bangin', 'bangin', '***three***', 'time', 'not', 'just', 'bangin', 'three', 'time', 'ROMANCIN', 'three', 'time', 'not', 'enough', 'three', 'time.Ho', 'boy', 'feency-schmancy', 'Romeo', 'not', 'just', 'case', 'wham-bam', ""thank-you-ma'am"", 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Herman', 'Broder', 'actually', 'playing', 'house', 'three', 'gals.But', 'thing', 'when', 'have', 'time', 'press', 'suit', 'eat', 'meal', 'have', 'cup', 'coffee', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'point', 'movie', 'primer', 'How', 'Be', 'Trigamist', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'noted', 'how', 'poor', 'sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'indeed', ""'re"", 'correct', 'who', 'know', 'sound', 'quality', 'when', 'Fredo', 'Corlieone', 'Hugh', 'Hefner', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'Aly', 'Khan', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'monks', 'compared', 'super-schtupper', 'Herman', 'Broder.And', 'what', 'Herman', 'appeal', 'three', 'women', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'clue', 'would', 'be', 'nice.Richard', 'Gere', 'now', 'nice', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'one', 'maybe', 'two', 'girls', 'would', 'go', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'shirt', 'movie', 'what', 'supposed', 'drive', 'women', 'audience', 'meshuga', 'Three', 'dames', ""'re"", 'Ron', 'Silver', 'proper', 'just', 'ratio', 'then', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'Herman', 'should', 'have', 'freakin', 'harem.Johnny', 'Weismueller', 'remember', 'Tarzan', 'shirt', 'understandable', 'women', 'swoon', 'Helen', 'Reddy', 'hot', 'flash', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'natural', 'let', 'face', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Tarzan', 'Cheetah', 'ok', 'might', 'have', 'chance', 'nailing', 'Maureen', ""O'Sullivan"", 'Jane', 'forget', 'it.Also', 'lost', 'point', 'how', 'Holocaust', 'story', 'OK', 'Herman', 'Holocaust', 'survivor', 'so', 'schtups', 'everything', 'tri-borough', 'area', 'course', 'noted', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'director', 'references', 'Holocaust', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Holocaust', 'references', 'Issac', 'Bashevah', 'Singer', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'are', 'marginal', 'as', 'unintelligible', 'are', 'movie.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Issac', 'Bashevah', 'Singer', 'novel', 'trust', 'story', 'more', 'intelligently', 'structured', 'movie', 'anyone', 'three', 'names', 'Issac', 'Bashevah', 'Singer', 'got', 'be', 'smarter', 'anyone', 'two', 'names', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'even', 'forget', 'how', 'Issac', 'middle', 'name', ""'m"", 'too', 'upset', 'Herman', 'Broder', 'out-humping', 'Fredo', 'Corlieone', 'paisan', 'look', 'up.Listen', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'denouement', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'point', 'story', 'assuming', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'posse', 'three', 'hands', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'can', 'play', 'hide', 'salami', 'three', 'gals', 'three', 'separate', 'apartments', 'three', 'different', 'NYC', 'boroughs', '*Italians*', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'great', 'lovers', 'not', 'schnook', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'fact', 'behalf', 'Italian', 'male', 'world', 'DEMAND', 'list', 'vitamins', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'copy', 'diet', 'dozen', 'cases', 'Manischevitz', 'wine', ""'m"", 'also', 'too', 'upset', 'get', 'correct', 'spelling', 'of.Because', 'even', 'mathematically', 'speaking', 'poor', 'ragazzo', 'Fredo', 'one-behind', 'Herman', 'Broder', 'should', 'get', 'respect', 'can', 'handle', 'things', 'smart', 'Not', 'everyone', 'not', 'dumb', 'smart', 'should', 'have', 'respect', 'Send', 'Fredo', 'do', 'send', 'Fredo', 'do', 'Let', 'Fredo', 'take', 'care', 'Michael', 'Mouse', 'night', 'club', 'somewhere', 'Send', 'Fredo', 'schtup', 'Sophie', 'Tucker', 'Ma', 'Kettle', 'airport', 'Well', 'ai', ""n't"", 'way', 'wanted']",N/A
