1377619,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,B003ZQ1RD0,Green Manalishi,"[10, 10]","This is a unique movie, evoking something of a colonial Africa 50 plus years ago.  Made in 1963, it details the story of a 10-year-old boy who, after just having lost his parents in an air raid in Port Said (Egypt) during the Suez crisis of 1956, takes to the road on his own in an effort to reach an aunt he has never met before living in Durban, South Africa.  Vagabonding with a number of different characters along the way, the story takes a fairly unsentimental approach to its main character, Sammy, and the characters his meets. It doesn't have that ""Hollywood"" feel, although some of the soundtrack music in the beginning may have been a bit over the top.  Overall though it's a pretty engaging little story and not least into the bargain are a plethora of stunning views - the best in armchair traveling!As to DVD production, the beautiful widescreen transfer is clear and the colors vibrant. On the con side however, I would have like to have had English subtitles.  Some of the different accents, not least of all British, had me struggling to understand at times. This added to the fact that sound effects volume often overrides the speaking.  Fortunately for the most part you get the gist of it.Special features include a couple of interviews - a colleague talks about director Alexander Mackendrick, and the actor who played Sammy (Fergus McClelland) discusses the film.Buyers should make sure they have a REGION-FREE player if watching in North America as this import disc is PAL region 2 for Europe/UK.Other recommendations:Whistle Down the WindBlack JackPoor Cow",5,Journey to the South,1295913600,"01 25, 2011",2011,1580,"['unique', 'movie', 'evoking', 'something', 'colonial', 'Africa', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'Made', '1963', 'details', 'story', '10-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'having', 'lost', 'parents', 'air', 'raid', 'Port', 'Said', 'Egypt', 'Suez', 'crisis', '1956', 'road', 'own', 'effort', 'reach', 'aunt', 'never', 'met', 'living', 'Durban', 'South', 'Africa', 'Vagabonding', 'number', 'different', 'characters', 'way', 'story', 'fairly', 'unsentimental', 'approach', 'main', 'character', 'Sammy', 'characters', 'meets', ""n't"", 'have', 'Hollywood', 'feel', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'beginning', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'top', 'Overall', 'pretty', 'engaging', 'little', 'story', 'not', 'least', 'bargain', 'are', 'plethora', 'stunning', 'views', 'best', 'armchair', 'traveling', 'DVD', 'production', 'beautiful', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'clear', 'colors', 'vibrant', 'con', 'side', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'had', 'English', 'subtitles', 'different', 'accents', 'not', 'least', 'British', 'had', 'struggling', 'understand', 'times', 'added', 'fact', 'sound', 'effects', 'volume', 'often', 'speaking', 'Fortunately', 'most', 'part', 'get', 'gist', 'it.Special', 'features', 'include', 'couple', 'interviews', 'colleague', 'talks', 'director', 'Alexander', 'Mackendrick', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Sammy', 'Fergus', 'McClelland', 'film.Buyers', 'should', 'make', 'sure', 'have', 'REGION-FREE', 'player', 'watching', 'North', 'America', 'import', 'disc', 'PAL', 'region', '2', 'Europe/UK.Other', 'recommendations', 'Whistle', 'WindBlack', 'JackPoor', 'Cow']",Sammy Going South [Region 2]

The narrative revolves around him, and he is not dismissed by the other characters for being a child, as so often happened in other non-children's films of the era. This is important, because it shows the audience that Sammy is a real person, and it makes the audience more interested in what makes him tick. It also makes the other main characters more human. Thus the audience is drawn into, and involved in this tremendously strong small story. It appears however that some of the film was lost, as the film was apparently originally ten minutes longer. This is a shame because the audience becomes aware of the tiny leaps in the narrative flow. Still a great film though.",5,Definitely hasn't gone south!,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,795,"['Great', 'see', 'story', 'quality', 'taken', 'seriously', 'well', 'acted', 'strong', 'central', 'character', 'Sammy', 'narrative', 'revolves', 'not', 'dismissed', 'other', 'characters', 'being', 'child', 'so', 'often', 'happened', 'other', 'non-children', 'films', 'era', 'important', 'audience', 'Sammy', 'real', 'person', 'audience', 'more', 'interested', 'what', 'tick', 'also', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'more', 'human', 'Thus', 'audience', 'drawn', 'involved', 'tremendously', 'strong', 'small', 'story', 'however', 'film', 'was', 'lost', 'film', 'was', 'apparently', 'originally', 'ten', 'minutes', 'longer', 'shame', 'audience', 'aware', 'tiny', 'leaps', 'narrative', 'flow', 'Still', 'great', 'film']",Sammy Going South [Region 2]
