I use to watchthis as a 8 year old! I can't believe it now. Kids today would neverwatch this kind of show. I watched this in reruns but in the 90'sI joined video club just to get these. I had them in closet for yearsand watched one every few weeks. this week I started from the beginningand just couldn't stop watching. Bob Cane was perfect in the role ofHogan. Klink and Shultz were also perfect. The entire cast is perfect.The writing is better than Mash! and most shows! It's funnier than almostanything ever written on tv but is overlooked by critics and other showsthat didn't even come close to it's incredible writing and comedy andacting. It's ashame this isn't in reruns so kids today can see what'sreal comedy is even though it's about one of the worst periods in history.maybe they wouldn't be so easy to believe in all the socialism and otherideas that they are being taught in school today! Freedom is worth fightingunder any circumstances and once you let the goverment tell you what to door think or eat or drive or whatever freedom is over and the period of historyseems to be forgotten by the youth of today.

1068642,AX7WZPQOY27IE,B000P5FH4O,Bookandfilmnut,"[5, 6]","Hogan's Heroes is not the best television comedy ever made.  But it may very well be the most under-rated.  For nearly forty-five years, it has been either pooh-poohed as nothing more than juvenile farce, or it castigated as insensitive and insulting to the victims of Nazi crimes against humanity.  But, reruns of this show have been on tv as long as I am old enough to remember, and I even have seen the program on German tv networks when I was in Europe.  With staying power like that, there must be more to the show than the critics see.And there is.  First, Hogan's Heroes is one of a handful of contemporaneous sit-coms that debuted in the 1965 television season that became staples in American pop-culture.  The 1965 season was something of a vintage year, as it seems to have launched more than its fair share of the most succesfully syndicated series in tv history -- the sit-coms Hogan's Heroes, I Dream of Jeannie, Get Smart, Green Acres and to a lesser degree, Gidget and F-Troop all debuted in 1965 and went on to have long, long careers on afternoon syndication throughout the 70's and 80's and well into the 90's.  Anyone who grew up in America during the 1970's and 80's can probably remember at least occasionally watching these programs on local television stations in the after-school hours -- along with 1964's Gilligan's Island and Bewitched, and earlier 60's sitcoms like Andy Griffith and McHales Navy.  These programs have become part of the national consciousness of a generation through their on-air omnipresence in syndication.And the best of the ""Class of '65"", and indeed the best sitcom of the entire late-60's, was Hogan's Heroes.Heavily indebted to earlier movies like Stalag 17 and The Great Escape, and even a little to Von Ryan's Express, Hogan's Heroes came out in an era when nostalgic programs saluting the war years were all over network television -- Combat, Twelve O'Clock High and The Rat Patrol come immediately to mind as contemporary WWII programs.  Hogan's Heroes combined the already popular ""Service Comedy"" genre to the mid-60's James Bond inspired ""spy craze"", and then set it in a German POW camp in 1943-44.Hogan's Heroes has more forms of humor to offer beyond farce.  The character Hogan himself has very witty lines, and uses dark gallows humor in the face of danger.  There is very little in the way of slapstick, much of the humor comes at the expense of Colonel Klink and his self-serving pomposity and incredible incompetence, but there are very few pratfalls or other ""pie-in-the-face"" type of humor.  It is largely a verbal comedy, or a comedy based on personalities and personal foibles.Every major German character - Klink, Schultz, Burkhalter and Hochstetter, were played by Jewish actors - three of whom escaped from Nazi Europe in the 1930's.The ""Heroes"", are a likable group of colleagues:  Carter, the pyrotechnical genius but otherwise with the naive mentality of an 11 year old boy; Newkirk, the cockney con-man and safecracker; LeBeau, the diminutive French ladies man; and Kinchloe, the steady and and reliable African American radio operator who is also Hogan's right hand man, and for the most part, the program's straight man.  They make a good team, and there is a real sense of comeraderie among them.The show combined comedy with action.  When Hogan and his men are actually on a mission, the humor is largely absent, except for the occasional one-liner.  Even with 168 episodes, the capers seldom seem repetitive, and usually they manage to build up some suspense.  You know Hogan is going to come out on top, the fun is, seeing how he snatches victory from the jaws of defeat time after time.  There are no firefights, noone dies on screen - but there is cloak and dagger suspense, like an episode of Mission:Impossible with a laugh track.The Hogan character is a pleasure to watch, and Bob Crane was extremely talented in playing both the level headed, calm in a crisis, well respected leader of men that Hogan actually is, and the naive, childlike inccocent facade that Hogan puts on when conning Klink and the other German officers.The best dynamic in the show, however, is the relationship between German Guard SGT Schultz, and the POW's, especially Hogan.  The POW's obviously like Schultz, and he likes them, and the whole message get across that all men could be friends if it weren't for the war.There was also a subtle message at the height of the Civil Rights era that black Americans can be a key member of a social group, too.  Very little is made of Kinchloe's race, he is just naturally and fully accepted by the others without comment on it.Of course there are huge historical inaccuracies -- there would never have been a POW camp where a Colonel would be housed with sergeants and corporals.  There were separate camps for officers, separate campls for NCO's and separate camps for the rank and file.  While it was common for a POW camp to house prisoners from different allied nations, the different nationals were always housed together - one section of the camp for American, one for UK and Commonwealth prisoner's, etc, etc.  But if you can accept the basic premise of the Nazi's being too stupid to catch on to Hogan's team, you can overlook the historical gaffes too.Just good, clean entertainment, so suspend your belief (as all good entertainment requires) and enjoy.",4,archetype of classic tv,1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,5372,"['Hogan', 'Heroes', 'not', 'best', 'television',

1068643,A2BIK37ZMXKW91,B000P5FH4O,"brian komyathy ""Thanks for scouting out my pa...","[39, 46]","The comedian Gilbert Gottfried (AF-lac!) has a bit about the least likely idea to make a sitcom about. Picture this: A Nazi-era German prisoner-of-war camp; allied inmates behind barbed-wire. It's a Comedy! Yeah, right. But somehow it made it into production & now it's out on DVD, finally. I'm not saying it's the greatest sitcom or anything, but it's a vaudevillian incarnation; a treat of the first order, and can be watched again and again---the test of a genuinely whimsical show. (""Family Ties"" & ""Barney Miller,"" amongst others, were funny when they were running, but are not at all interesting to me anymore, for instance.) Quite possibly, the thing that saves ""Hogan's Heroes"" is that it wasn't contemporary when it came out. The plots of this WW2-set show run the gamut of the allied inmates trying to swipe or disable anything of a military nature that passes through the camp, to kidnapping German scientists, blowing up bridges miles from camp, and impersonating German officers in town...as they utilize escape tunnels to leave and return to camp, as well as employing hidden radio transmitters to send and receive coded messages from London, and most importantly play on Camp Kommandant Colonel Klink's gullibility to make him an unwitting partner in some measure, in their exploits. TV programs set in specific historical periods are simply not as easily ""dated"" as other shows are (think of ""Sanford & Son,"" ""Growing Pains; even dramas the likes of ""Hill St. Blues""). ""M*A*S*H,"" for instance, is still a great show and, like Hogan's Heroes,"" is holding up well. Exaggerated characters helps too---think of Hawkeye Pierce's Groucho Marx-inspired one-liners in ""M*A*S*H."" Colonel Klink likewise is a standout, and is thus (in my opinion at least) the real star of ""Hogan's Heroes;"" in the same sense that Gracie Allen was more essential than George Burns in making the great Burns & Allen combination successful. Klink's flamboyantly delicious delivery of his oft-repeated (of course, ridiculously untrue) lines, admonishing anyone and everyone that ""There has Nev-er been an escape from Stalag 13!"" or ""This is the toughest P-O-W camp in all of Germany,"" never get old. Even funnier is when he cannot even finish such lines before being told to shut up by General Burkhalter or other visiting superior officers. While you're at it too, there's another show very much like this one. It was made in the the UK and is called ""Allo, Allo."" It's also set in WW2 Europe, but this time in a German-occupied French town. Akin to ""Hogan's Heroes"" the Germans are likewise obtuse while the French resistance attempts to persuade the same unfortunate cafe owner each episode to facilitate their wacky schemes along the lines of Hogan's men. Check out some reviews of it. If you're a fan of ""Hogan's Heroes"" you'll probably think it a riot; I do. Cheers!",5,Colonel Klink?

If it were only the show being reviewed here, 5 stars wouldn't have been enough! But like me, you'll probably also be disappointed when you receive your package only to find that there is nothing here that you couldn't have gotten for around $23 less by just ordering the individual seasons at (current Amazon price) $15.99.It's a sucker deal! There's absolutely no advantage to paying the extra dough because you get nothing extra for the money! Not even a nice box to contain and/or display the set, nothing at all other than the same six seasons, in the same untidy packaging that you'd get for the lower price of $95.94 if buying the seasons separately! And with Amazon's free shipping on orders over $25 or free 2-day shipping with an Amazon prime membership, shipping costs don't play into it at all.The set doesn't display nicely on a shelf because the spines aren't uniform, nor are the seasons identically packaged.Season 1: 5 discs, each in its own slimcase.Seasons 2 and 3: 5 discs in only 3 slimcases (per season), meaning that two of the three cases contain 2 discs each.Seasons 4, 5 and 6: 4 discs in two slimcases (per season).That's 6 sets in boxes of three different sizes with unidentical print design on the spines. There is no ""good side"" to display!What the...? Add it all up and you have an untidy, not so great looking set for purposes of presentation on a shelf or media rack. Still, it's Hogan's Heroes!

The set I received must be the culmination of each season released separately. I say that because each season is packaged differently and has different pre-show things shown. And, these pre-show things, including the listing of episodes on the disk, are very, very, very loud. I learned to turn off the sound until an episode has actually started.Each episode is funny, as expected. The Big Three, Klink, Shultz and Hogan, played their parts so well (hard to believe all three are now gone). Their characters never got old for me. It is still fun to watch the cautious friendship both Shultz and Klink form with Hogan.What did surprise me is, when watching an entire season in a short amount of time, how each episode seems to be pretty much the same as prior episodes. It is also interesting to note all of the guest stars throughout the series, knowing what eventually became of the actor/actress.I am glad I ordered this set.",4,Reliving a show I loved when it was originally shown,1245715200,"06 23, 2009",2009,1053,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'shown', 'network', 'television', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'now', 'available', 'set', 'received', 'must', 'be', 'culmination', 'season', 'released', 'separately', 'say', 'season', 'packaged', 'differently', 'different', 'pre-show', 'things', 'shown', 'pre-show', 'things', 'including', 'listing', 'episodes', 'disk', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'loud', 'learned', 'turn', 'off', 'sound', 'episode', 'actually', 'started.Each', 'episode', 'funny', 'expected', 'Big', 'Three', 'Klink', 'Shultz', 'Hogan', 'played', 'parts', 'so', 'well', 'hard', 'believe', 'three', 'are', 'now', 'gone', 'characters', 'never', 'got', 'old', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'cautious', 'friendship', 'Shultz', 'Klink', 'form', 'Hogan.What', 'did', 'surprise', 'when', 'watching', 'entire', 'season', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'how', 'episode', 'be', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'prior', 'episodes', 'also', 'interesting', 'note', 'guest', 'series', 'knowing', 'what', 'eventually', 'became', 'actor/actress.I', 'am', 'glad', 'ordered', 'set']",Hogan's Heroes - The Complete Series

The idea of bringing enough variety to the story of a POW camp week in and week out was not feasible - yet they did it! The combination of both humor and drama in a POW camp could not be put together without being too 'jarring' to the fans - yet they did it! And as interesting as all these combinations could be, it was still a long shot to pull this off in just the right way - yet they did it! And whomever 'they' are and were - directors, producers, actors, writers, etc. - THEY DID IT!This is a classic that combines truth (there are still POWs that will hint at the little tricks they pulled and sometimes got by with against their POW guards), humor (even against brutal odds in real life, many POWS probably have had to develop a sense of humor to survive their surroundings) and the diligence of the human spirit (POWs have escaped and risked it all to help others as well) - and turns that combination into a CLASSIC FOR ALL TIME!",5,Everlasting Classic,1244764800,"06 12, 2009",2009,1250,"['HOGAN', 'HEROES', 'one', 'rare', 'sit-coms', 'could', 'did', 'combine', 'humor', 'drama', 'something', 'turned', 'right', 'start', 'true', 'classic', 'everyone', '6', '90', 'generation', 'can', 'enjoy.The', 'premise', 'making', 'comedy', 'POW', 'camp', 'was', 'impossible', 'yet', 'did', 'idea', 'bringing', 'enough', 'variety', 'story', 'POW', 'camp', 'week', 'week', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'feasible', 'yet', 'did', 'combination', 'humor', 'drama', 'POW', 'camp', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'together', 'being', 'too', ""'jarring"", 'fans', 'yet', 'did', 'as', 'interesting', 'combinations', 'could', 'be', 'was', 'still', 'long', 'shot', 'pull', 'off', 'just', 'right', 'way', 'yet', 'did', 'whomever', ""'they"", 'are', 'were', 'directors', 'producers', 'actors', 'writers', 'etc', 'THEY', 'DID', 'IT', 'classic', 'combines', 'truth', 'are', 'still', 'POWs', 'will', 'hint', 'little', 'tricks', 'pulled', 'sometimes', 'got', 'POW', 'guards', 'humor', 'even', 'brutal', 'odds', 'real', 'life', 'many', 'POWS', 'probably', 'have', 'had', 'develop', 'sense', 'humor', 'survive', 'surroundings', 'diligence', 'human', 'spirit', 'POWs', 'have', 'escaped', 'risked', 'help', 'others', 'well', 'combination', 'CLASSIC', 'ALL', 'TIME']",Hogan's Heroes - The Complete Series
