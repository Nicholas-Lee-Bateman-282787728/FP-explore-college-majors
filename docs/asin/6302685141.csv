[Symbolism?] Jim Stark is arrested for ""plain drunkenness"". Judy is at the police station, she was wandering around in the early morning (she has a problem with her father). [Jim has a problem in growing up.] John is brought in for shooting some puppies! [A sign of a bad future?] Jim's parents have conflicts, his striking the desk shows his troubled personality. Jim's inability to make friends suggests his peers recognize his troubled psyche. Jim quickly sobers up after his talk with the Juvenile Bureau officer. Jim's father offers good advice about picking friends.The field trip at the Planetarium predicts the end of the world [symbolism for this movie?] Is this some type of conditioning to confuse students? Jim Stark meets a local gang and undergoes an initiation rite. Back home his dad wears an apron over his business suit! [Unbelievable?] Unlike other teenagers, Jim does not have a good appetite. Judy also has a problem with her home life. [Does the script show cartoon characters?] Then we see the strange game of ""chicken"" that sets a bad example for kids foolish enough to identify with these characters (who seem to have little parental supervision). One driver bails out, the other has an unintended consequence. Jim gets to drive Judy home. John tags along, like a lost puppy. John also drives a motor scooter, a symbol of an odd choice. At home Jim drinks milk out of a glass bottle [more symbolism?].Back home Jim delights in scandalizing his parents with his confession of wrongdoing. His parents try to talk sense to him but Jim seems to be self-destructive. [No wonder he has trouble making friends, they sense his troubled psyche.] The script calls for Jim and Judy to go up the hill to an old deserted mansion (in the middle of Griffith Park?). John is attacked by Buzz's friends, they take an address book to find Jim. John figures out where they went. [There seems to be some symbolism in meeting in an empty and desolate house.] Their talk and laughter seems out of character for these teenagers. The fantasies of John show his psychological problems. Jim and Judy talk about what they want. [Can teenager really know what they want?] Buzz's three friends find where Jim is hiding. Now there is more trouble, and the police show up. Jim's parents show up for more drama and ironic comments. The teenagers flee to the Planetarium. Will the end of their world come soon? Jim seems to develop a new personality. The ending seems long and drawn out for no apparent reason, unless it is to lull the viewers for the surprise ending. [I found this to be quite amusing.] There was little news coverage of this police action, that would not happen in real life.After 50 years the only reason to watch this film is for historical reasons. What made this so popular in its day? Pandering to teenagers? It has a clunky script and story, like some drive-in movie of that time.",2,Teenage Exploitation Movie,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,3001,"['opening', 'scene', 'man', 'dressed', 'suit', 'tie', 'who', 'ground', 'look', 'toy', 'monkey', '[', 'Symbolism', ']', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'arrested', 'plain', 'drunkenness', 'Judy', 'police', 'station', 'was', 'wandering', 'around', 'early', 'morning', 'problem', 'father', '[', 'Jim', 'problem', 'growing', 'up', ']', 'John', 'brought', 'shooting', 'puppies', '[', 'sign', 'bad', 'future', ']', 'Jim', 'parents', 'have', 'conflicts', 'striking', 'desk', 'troubled', 'personality', 'Jim', 'inability', 'make', 'friends', 'peers', 'recognize', 'troubled', 'psyche', 'Jim', 'quickly', 'up', 'talk', 'Juvenile', 'Bureau', 'officer', 'Jim', 'father', 'offers', 'good', 'advice', 'picking', 'friends.The', 'field', 'trip', 'Planetarium', 'end', 'world', 'symbolism', 'movie', ']', 'type', 'conditioning', 'confuse', 'students', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'local', 'gang', 'initiation', 'rite', 'Back', 'home', 'dad', 'apron', 'business', 'suit', '[', 'Unbelievable', ']', 'other', 'teenagers', 'Jim', 'not', 'have', 'good', 'appetite', 'Judy', 'also', 'problem', 'home', 'life', '[', 'script', 'show', 'cartoon', 'characters', ']', 'Then', 'see', 'strange', 'game', 'chicken', 'bad', 'example', 'kids', 'foolish', 'enough', 'identify', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'little', 'parental', 'supervision', 'One', 'driver', 'out', 'other', 'unintended', 'consequence', 'Jim', 'drive', 'Judy', 'home', 'John', 'along', 'lost', 'puppy', 'John', 'also', 'motor', 'scooter', 'symbol', 'odd', 'choice', 'home', 'Jim', 'milk', 'glass', 'bottle', '[', 'more', 'symbolism', ']', '.Back', 'home', 'Jim', 'delights', 'scandalizing', 'parents', 'confession', 'wrongdoing', 'parents', 'try', 'talk', 'sense', 'Jim', 'be', 'self-destructive', '[', 'wonder', 'trouble', 'making', 'friends', 'sense', 'troubled', 'psyche', ']', 'script', 'Jim', 'Judy', 'go', 'up', 'hill', 'old', 'deserted', 'mansion', 'middle', 'Griffith', 'Park', 'John', 'attacked', 'Buzz', 'friends', 'take', 'address', 'book', 'find', 'Jim', 'John', 'out', 'where', 'went', '[', 'be', 'symbolism', 'meeting', 'empty', 'desolate', 'house', ']', 'talk', 'laughter', 'character', 'teenagers', 'fantasies', 'John', 'show', 'psychological', 'problems', 'Jim', 'Judy', 'talk', 'what', 'want', '[', 'Can', 'teenager', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'want', ']', 'Buzz', 'three', 'friends', 'find', 'where', 'Jim', 'hiding', 'Now', 'more', 'trouble', 'police', 'show', 'up', 'Jim', 'parents', 'show', 'up', 'more', 'drama', 'ironic', 'comments', 'teenagers', 'flee', 'Planetarium', 'Will', 'end', 'world', 'come', 'soon', 'Jim', 'develop', 'new', 'personality', 'ending', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'apparent', 'reason', 'lull', 'viewers', 'surprise', 'ending', '[', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'amusing', 'was', 'little', 'news', 'coverage', 'police', 'action', 'would', 'not', 'happen', 'real', 'life.After', '50', 'years', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'historical', 'reasons', 'What', 'made', 'so', 'popular', 'day', 'Pandering', 'teenagers', 'clunky', 'script', 'story', 'drive-in', 'movie', 'time']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

I give this movie thumbs up on the storyline, acting, and cinematography. It is an intense movie about tragic teenage rebellion set in the 1950s and depicted in a timeless fashion. James Dean emanates star quality as he gives it his all to portray a character filled with angst and confusion, leaving him lost in a life of parental hypocrisy that he cannot understand or accept. I especially like the clips from the actual audition and his brief interview/promo of the film. He ends the interview with an ominous advice and request for fast/reckless drivers to be careful while driving, stating ""The life you save may be mine"".",5,You're tearing me apart!,1072742400,"12 30, 2003",2003,700,"['James', 'Dean', 'movie', 'be', 'seen', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'give', 'movie', 'up', 'storyline', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'intense', 'movie', 'tragic', 'teenage', 'rebellion', 'set', '1950s', 'depicted', 'timeless', 'fashion', 'James', 'Dean', 'star', 'quality', 'portray', 'character', 'filled', 'angst', 'confusion', 'leaving', 'lost', 'life', 'parental', 'hypocrisy', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'accept', 'especially', 'clips', 'actual', 'audition', 'brief', 'interview/promo', 'film', 'interview', 'ominous', 'advice', 'request', 'fast/reckless', 'drivers', 'be', 'careful', 'driving', 'stating', 'life', 'save', 'may', 'be', 'mine']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

327966,AGEIT17HENDIS,6302685141,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","One does not have to a consummate academic historian of the modern bourgeois family (since the 1700s), like the late Professor Lawrence Stone, to realize that being a teenager, of any class and in any period in the modern era is fraught with terror, danger, loneliness, and maddening experiences as one tries to cope with a world that one has not made, or been asked about making. While the teen angst and alienation issues shift over time, and as a general proposition have gotten more baffling, they tend to follow that above-mentioned pattern. Except that the rich and the middle class have more resources than the working class and poor to ""cushion"" the blows.And that last statement kind of sums up the film under review, ""Rebel Without A Cause"". The troubles of one Jim Stark (played by short-lived, hard living, hard driving, and I don't mean just automobiles, but eternally worshipped ""heartthrob"", James Dean), his wanna-be girl, Judy, (played by nice girl gone slightly wrong Natalie Wood), and his wanna-be friend the forever ""lost"" boy, Plato, (played to a tee by Sal Mineo) seem minor compared to today's mass assault on teen sensibility. The film  nevertheless disclosed in its own way the attempt to gather in the youth tribe (or, rather tribes) as our hero, Jim, tries to assert his manhood, his personhood, and his ""style"" in a post-World War II up and coming  bourgeois community  (California, of course) that just want to make ""nice."" ""Rumblefish"", ""The Flatlanders"" or any of S.E.Hinton's master works this is not, but as a slice, a thin slice, of dealing with the complexities of teen angst, and how adult writers and filmmakers think that it plays out as a reflection of their society at a particular period, it is worth a watch.",4,Why Must I Be A Teenager...,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,1751,"['One', 'not', 'have', 'consummate', 'academic', 'historian', 'modern', 'bourgeois', 'family', '1700s', 'late', 'Professor', 'Lawrence', 'Stone', 'realize', 'being', 'teenager', 'class', 'period', 'modern', 'era', 'fraught', 'terror', 'danger', 'loneliness', 'maddening', 'experiences', 'one', 'cope', 'world', 'one', 'not', 'made', 'been', 'asked', 'making', 'teen', 'angst', 'alienation', 'issues', 'shift', 'time', 'general', 'proposition', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'baffling', 'tend', 'follow', 'above-mentioned', 'pattern', 'rich', 'middle', 'class', 'have', 'more', 'resources', 'working', 'class', 'poor', 'cushion', 'blows.And', 'last', 'statement', 'kind', 'sums', 'film', 'review', 'Rebel', 'A', 'Cause', 'troubles', 'one', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'played', 'short-lived', 'hard', 'living', 'hard', 'driving', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'just', 'automobiles', 'eternally', 'worshipped', 'heartthrob', 'James', 'Dean', 'wanna-be', 'girl', 'Judy', 'played', 'nice', 'girl', 'gone', 'slightly', 'wrong', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'wanna-be', 'friend', 'forever', 'lost', 'boy', 'Plato', 'played', 'tee', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'seem', 'minor', 'compared', 'today', 'mass', 'assault', 'teen', 'sensibility', 'film', 'nevertheless', 'disclosed', 'own', 'way', 'attempt', 'gather', 'youth', 'tribe', 'rather', 'tribes', 'hero', 'Jim', 'assert', 'manhood', 'personhood', 'style', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'up', 'coming', 'bourgeois', 'community', 'California', 'course', 'just', 'want', 'make', 'nice', 'Rumblefish', 'Flatlanders', 'S.E.Hinton', 'master', 'not', 'slice', 'thin', 'slice', 'dealing', 'complexities', 'teen', 'angst', 'how', 'adult', 'writers', 'filmmakers', 'think', 'out', 'reflection', 'society', 'particular', 'period', 'watch']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS
327967,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,6302685141,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[3, 3]","Is it really fifty years old?  REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE seems to me as shocking, graphic and vivid as if it were released last week.  This is a story about the new kid in town (James Dean) who finds common cause with a local good-girl-going-bad (Natalie Wood) and befriends a chronic misfit (Sal Mineo).  After a particularly gruesome accident which isn't really our hero's fault, the local gang is out to get him.The sociology never interferes with the drama but enhances it.  These are ""nice"" crewcut middle-class kids with money and leisure but some violent ways of using them.  Most of all I was reminded of a near-cliche that is often applied to gangs from the wrong side of the track--that they sense an absence of father and are trying to make up for that with any substitute that will work.The Dean character's father (played with dithering brilliance by Jim Backus) is not the kind of man who inspires manly virtue in his son.  Indeed, his main concern seems to be to placate his nagging wife and his second concern, a lust to ""go along and get along"" and principle be damned.In an extended sequence when Dean is hiding from the gang, he forms an impromptu alternate family with ""spouse"" Wood and ""sonny"" Sal Mineo.  So well is this film cast and the characters so well portrayed that we well understand how this alternative take on family life is much more psychically fulfilling than the misunderstood and misunderstanding real thing.Along with powerful direction and dialog so good it circumvented this critic's ear and went straight to his feelings, look for then-newcomers Dennis Hopper and Nick Adams as part of the gang.  Ed Platt -- he who became ""Maxwell Smart's"" boss in Sixties TV -- plays the part of the police officer concerned with youth with caring, vigor and intelligence.  He makes all the ""crusty  but  lovable"" authority types in so many other films and TV look quaint and awkward.  The commentary is one of the best I have ever witnessed; it's narrated by an expert on Dean and really gets into his and the other principal actors' motives and desires to be in this film.  That and anecdotal material on the second disc make this well worth the extra six dollars the dual-disc REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE has over the single.Since this movie was filmed during the heyday of censorship, the worst word you're apt to hear is ""slut.""  So much the better, I would recommend this for teen groups or church groups of any age over puberty.  Sure, the jalopies are now beaters and Main Street is the mall, but the struggle of young people to become adults and act out various versions of it along the way is just as plangent now as it was in 1955.

Miller,"[2, 2]","Rebel Without a Cause [Limited DigiBook Blu-ray] [1955] More than half a century after its original release, Rebel Without A Cause remains one of the most enduring motion pictures of all time. Starring James Dean in what many consider to be his finest performance, this cinematic and cultural milestone is now re-mastered and presented on Blu-ray for the very first time!Powerfully directed by Nicholas Ray, Dean plays the ultimate teenage rebel and, together with Academy Award nominated costars Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, gives voice to the post-war subculture of troubled American youth. His unforgettable performance is the highlight of a film that was landmark achievement. Rebel Without A Cause is included in the Library of Congress' National Film Registry and is on the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the 100 Greatest American Movies Of All Time. Since its October 1955 release, &#8220;Rebel Without A Cause&#8221; has become one of the archetypal films of teenage angst, an enduring hit with successive generations and a harbinger of things to come in the tumultuous Sixties. The fact that all of the film's stars, Nick Adams, Dean, Wood and Mineo died tragically and early has also lent a mystique to this powerful, ground-breaking film that continues to this day.Cast: James Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, Jim Backus, Ann Doran, Corey Allen, Dennis Hopper and William HopperDirector: Nicolas RayProducer: David WeisbartScreenplay: Stewart SternComposer: Leonard RosenmanCinematographer: Ernest HallerAudio: English: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French: Dolby Digital Mono, Spanish: Dolby Digital Mono, German: Dolby Digital Mono, Italian: Dolby Digital Mono, Portuguese: DTS Mono, Czech: Dolby Digital Mono, Polish: Dolby Digital Mono and Japanese: Dolby Digital MonoSubtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, German SDH, Italian SDH, Czech, Danish, Finnish, Hebrew, Korean, Mandarin (Simplified), Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Swedish and TurkishResolution: 1080p [WarnerColor]Aspect Ratio: 2.55:1 [CinemaScope]Running Time: 1 hour 51 minutesRegion: Region A/1Number of discs: 1Studio: Warner Bros.Andrew&#8217;s Blu-ray Review &#8211; The concept of Rebel Without a Cause was to focus on telling a story about confused middle class teenagers living in Suburbia. How the story was told was a different matter altogether. Back in 1955, when the film was first released, the film was controversial at the time as it seemingly depicted teenage rebellion and moral decay in the 1950s. Yet there is a lot that happens in the course of the film that has made it become the classic that it is heralded as. Originally conceived to be a cheaply produced black-and-white movie, Warner Bros had switched the production into a larger budget mode and with colour filming when it became apparent that James Dean was one of the rising stars of the time.From the opening frame of the film, James Dean began to deliver an iconic performance. He was creatively enmeshed in his characters. The first shots of the film show Dean laying on the ground. He is playing with a toy monkey. This was improvised. He asked the filmmaker Nicholas Ray if he could try something. This became the opening of the movie. Quite a fascinating moment. James Dean was capable of such amazing acting. He had so many ideas.The story of Rebel Without a Cause primarily follows the teenagers Jim Stark [James Dean], Judy [Natalie Wood], and Plato [Sal Mineo] as they try to make sense of their lives while a sequence of events sends things spiraling for all of them. At the start of the film, the three teenagers are all in a police station, each needing their parents to get them. Jim's parents argumentative nature around Jim makes him more restless and distant. Judy's father is shockingly distant from her with a cold detachment. Plato's father abandoned him. The characters in this story each deal with their own feelings of displacement.One of the greatest sequences in the film is when the characters first meet each other while attending a school field trip to an observatory. There, while witnessing a theoretical show displaying the destruction of the entire universe, the wide expansiveness of the world is seemingly even colder to them than before. It's a perfect metaphor for how the three characters are going through such severe feelings of isolation and misunderstandings.The performances by James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Sal Mineo are equally great. Each actor brought a memorable performance to the screen. Over the course of the story, Jim and Judy seem somewhat parental to the Plato character. They even enact a 'game' of sorts at one point, inhabiting these roles. Dean and Wood had immense screen chemistry together and were perfectly in synch with each other during this film. The confusion and angst felt from the characters was well demonstrated by the performances.Nicholas Ray did an excellent job as the director of &#8220;Rebel Without a Cause&#8221;. The story is a complicated one to tell, and was not a small task for Ray to attempt to realize as director. Everything about the film was stylistically 'ace' and he managed to have the actors create compelling characters that could be universally fascinating and compelling.The film has incredible pacing and flows from one scene into the next with a remarkable vitality that's essentially fundamental to the film's success. This universally appealing story was one he managed to tell with a heart and soul in the filmmaking, which makes the tragic ending so powerful that one can truly consider it amongst the best film endings of all time.Blu-ray Video Quality - In my estimation, Rebel Without a Cause is the best looking film out of the three James Dean films. There is something about its unique visual style that impresses me the most. Perhaps it has something to do with the colour and the way it brings the best out of the costumes, especially the famous red jacket Dean wore during the film. All three films contain excellent cinematography, and yet I found the work that was done by the Academy Award winning cinematographer Ernest Haller. The original 2.55:1 theatrical aspect ratio has been preserved. The 1080p image quality is splendid and has an average bit-rate is around 25 mbps. This is certainly not a huge sampling rate, but it's par-the-course for Warner Bros and it's adequate for this presentation. I found the film to have good colour depth and decent clarity. The film could have been sharper. However, the sharpness in this transfer is notable, nonetheless, and far better when compared to earlier presentations of &#8220;Rebel Without a Cause&#8221;.Blu-ray Audio Quality - Unlike the audio presentation Giant received, Warner Bros. has given &#8220;Rebel Without a Cause&#8221; an audio makeover of sorts with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio presentation. I'm all for keeping the original audio intact but this is actually not that bad of a sound mix for the film. Surprisingly, I found it sounded rather authentic with the material. There's a bit more dimensionality to the mix, especially when the car sequences are taken into account, and with regards to the way score music was implemented. However, I will also maintain that this is a authentic sounding mix that is generally an impressive and satisfactory experience. It's still a front-heavy mix. It implements a good range of bass into the sound-stage. It's simply a nice expansion to the audio presentation and not an awful attempt at utilizing sound effects beyond their capabilities. Film fans won't feel disappointed by the presentation as long as the audio-purist in them doesn't kick it into over-drive on this one.Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:Commentary By Douglas L.

327969,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302685141,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","As a film, `Rebel Without a Cause' works very well.  It is dated and strategically melodramatic in parts, but overall the film is, for all intensive purposes, cinematic magic.  While I cannot say that it is without faults, and I will admit that upon watching it the first time I was left bewildered at its following and found it underwhelmed, the fact remains that the film, bolstered by a brilliant lead performance, has the ultimate staying power.  I found myself unable to stop thinking about it for weeks.  I just had to watch it again.  I had to watch it with others to get their perspective on the film.  It became somewhat of an obsession for me.  When the dust had settled I realized that regardless of the films problems, I love it for what it is.Coming at things from the viewpoint of a teenager, `Rebel Without a Cause' was a landmark in film.  Sadly, that status was only exemplified by the unfortunate loss of its lead actor; James Dean.  This actor made a serious splash on the big screen with three marvelously textured performances, but this is marred forever by the fact that he died before he could see the fruits of his labor.His legacy lives on, and rightfully so, in the television screens of millions.As Jim Stark, James Dean unearthed a giant.  He took a character that was misunderstood and underappreciated by most of Hollywood giants and created something universally `felt'.  Jim Stark is a part of us all; a confused teenager who craves attention but doesn't know how to get it.  He's a warm hearted young man who is misjudged by those around him, a man deeply affected by his role models; plagued by a future he doesn't want to embrace.  He is you and me and everyone we know, and James Dean made sure that we understood that.  What is so remarkable about this performance is that Dean was able to transcend stereotypes by layering Stark with so many contradictory emotions.  I remember reading a novel not too long ago that referred to teenagers as `acceptably schizophrenic'.  Their behavior doesn't make sense due to the increase of hormones and it is acceptable; normal even.  That is why this characterization makes so much sense in this film.  Dean attacked every emotional upheaval with enough connective tissue to make Jim Stark make total sense.The supporting cast is good as well.  Natalie Wood is endearing with the right amount of flirtation to make her accessible.  Sal Mineo doesn't quite handle the emotional fluctuations with the same amount of ease as Dean (he comes off whinny and forced in many instanced) but his character itself has the arc needed to flesh out Jim Stark's inevitabilities.  You can't have one without the other.  I also really loved Jim Backus as Stark's dominated father.In the end I totally recommend this film.  Like I said, I love it.  It tackles important themes in the life of the average teen, a time when emotions run high and logic is, well, illogical.  The film does feel very dated and can at times feel corny when considered in the context of `today' or `mainstream cinema', but when fawned over as the classic it really is those comparisons should not be made.  I do strongly believe that the film is remembered more for James Dean and his magnificent performance than for the actual quality of the film itself, but James Dean aside, this is still a very good film.",4,"Once a rebel, always a rebel...",1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,3345,"['film', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'works', 'very', 'well', 'dated', 'strategically', 'melodramatic', 'parts', 'film', 'intensive', 'purposes', 'cinematic', 'magic', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'faults', 'will', 'admit', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'left', 'bewildered', 'following', 'found', 'underwhelmed', 'fact', 'film', 'bolstered', 'brilliant', 'lead', 'performance', 'ultimate', 'staying', 'power', 'found', 'unable', 'stop', 'thinking', 'weeks', 'just', 'had', 'watch', 'again', 'had', 'watch', 'others', 'get', 'perspective', 'film', 'became', 'somewhat', 'obsession', 'When', 'dust', 'had', 'settled', 'realized', 'regardless', 'films', 'problems', 'love', 'what', 'is.Coming', 'things', 'viewpoint', 'teenager', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'was', 'landmark', 'film', 'Sadly', 'status', 'was', 'only', 'exemplified', 'unfortunate', 'loss', 'lead', 'actor', 'James', 'Dean', 'actor', 'made', 'serious', 'splash', 'big', 'screen', 'three', 'marvelously', 'textured', 'performances', 'marred', 'forever', 'fact', 'died', 'could', 'see', 'fruits', 'labor.His', 'legacy', 'rightfully', 'so', 'television', 'screens', 'millions.As', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'James', 'Dean', 'unearthed', 'giant', 'took', 'character', 'was', 'misunderstood', 'underappreciated', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'giants', 'created', 'something', 'universally', 'felt', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'part', 'confused', 'teenager', 'who', 'attention', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'get', 'warm', 'hearted', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'misjudged', 'man', 'deeply', 'affected', 'role', 'models', 'plagued', 'future', ""n't"", 'want', 'embrace', 'everyone', 'know', 'James', 'Dean', 'made', 'sure', 'understood', 'What', 'so', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'Dean', 'was', 'able', 'transcend', 'stereotypes', 'layering', 'Stark', 'so', 'many', 'contradictory', 'emotions', 'remember', 'reading', 'novel', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'referred', 'teenagers', 'acceptably', 'schizophrenic', 'behavior', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'due', 'increase', 'hormones', 'acceptable', 'normal', 'even', 'why', 'characterization', 'so', 'much', 'sense', 'film', 'Dean', 'attacked', 'emotional', 'upheaval', 'enough', 'connective', 'tissue', 'make', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'make', 'total', 'sense.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'endearing', 'right', 'amount', 'flirtation', 'make', 'accessible', 'Sal', 'Mineo', ""n't"", 'quite', 'handle', 'emotional', 'fluctuations', 'same', 'amount', 'ease', 'Dean', 'whinny', 'forced', 'many', 'instanced', 'character', 'arc', 'needed', 'flesh', 'out', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'inevitabilities', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'other', 'also', 'really', 'loved', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'Stark', 'dominated', 'father.In', 'end', 'totally', 'recommend', 'film', 'said', 'love', 'important', 'themes', 'life', 'average', 'teen', 'time', 'when', 'emotions', 'run', 'high', 'logic', 'well', 'illogical', 'film', 'feel', 'very', 'dated', 'can', 'times', 'feel', 'corny', 'when', 'considered', 'context', 'today', 'mainstream', 'cinema', 'when', 'fawned', 'classic', 'really', 'comparisons', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'do', 'strongly', 'believe', 'film', 'remembered', 'more', 'James', 'Dean', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'actual', 'quality', 'film', 'James', 'Dean', 'aside', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'film']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

327971,A2SPMLHB7ZA836,6302685141,Ann,"[1, 2]","This movie is about a teenager (James Dean) who was a troublemaker that caused his family to move alot. He meets a pretty teenage girl (Natalie Wood) and a troubled boy (Sal Mineo)at the police station (where he was found drunk by a cop earlier). Later he meets the girl's boyfriend and his gang who terrorized him.The three teens had trouble times with their fathers: James' character had a spineless father who won't stand up for him in front of his domineering mother.  Natalie's character was distraught because her father won't return her affections.  Sal's character was neglected by his own father (the only time his father paid attention to him was a check sent to him, but no &quot;Hi&quot; or any written note).There are tender times like in the deserted manison that the three stayed at after a hard night with their families, and tragic scenes like the &quot;chicken run&quot; James had with Buzz, Natalie's character's boyfriend (Buzz died).There are more to it than I am telling you here, so you just have to watch the movie.

327972,A3PMEJAYKF3VUC,6302685141,"Antoine D. Reid ""80sforever""","[5, 8]","You can read dozens, if not hundreds, of reviews of ""Rebel Without a Cause"" here and elsewhere on the internet. In a nutshell, this is a story about the emerging ""teenager"" in America, post-World War II; troubled, lonely, dangerous and hard to understand. James Dean plays Jim, the new guy in town, the outisder. Even though the cover and movie poster makes him seem dangerous and bad, Jim really isn't like that. He's rather soft, shy, unable to fit in with those his age. Natalie Wood plays the bad girl next door who, like Jim, is misunderstood. Her father turns a cold shoulder to her, leaving her with the only option of acting out in order to get his attention.What's so different about the ""Special Edition?"" Unlike the original DVD/VHS release a few years back, this one has extras galore. It's released as part of the James Dean collection. So, it has a lot of extra features that focuses on James Dean the actor. It doesn't stop there. It has a near-40 minute long feature from those who produced the movie that explains how it came about and the different aspects and production points. So, in total, you're getting:*Commentary by Douglas L. Rathgeb: If you've seen the movie, then you can simply click this on in the menu and listen to this author, who wrote a book about the movie a while ago, talk about a lot of behind the scenes, ""did you know...,"" actor and casting secrets behind the movie. He speaks constantly and tells you just about all you'd ever want and need to know about the movie, including where it differs from the book and he even tries to explain some of the plot holes that may hold the movie back.*Theatrical trailor: The original trailor to the movie. It's rather long, considering it's a trailor, and is basically a montage of scenes from the film, some that may reveal some of the best scenes before they are seen.~DISC 2~*""Rebel Without a Cause: Defiant Innocents"" documentary: Long, about 40 minutes. It's informative and again, reveals some things you may not know about the film and answers some questions. I personally found it to drag on a bit and didn't really get interested until the end when they talked about how Dean's death impacted the film.*""James Dean Remembered"" documentary: This is the best feature, in my opinion, on the disc. This was a documentary filmed 20 years after James Dean's death. Sammy Davis jr., Natalie Wood and numerous others sit down and talk about Dean, as they remembered him. There were anecdotes about James Dean's encounter with Marlon Brando, his alleged homosexual life, his odd behavior, his humor, the way he acted. It includes a lot of scenes from his three films, as well as a few other TV show appearances. This feature is nearly an hour long but had me hooked the minute it began.* 3 Warner Bros. segments: These are little ""behind the scenes"" bits that feature Natalie Wood, Jim B. (plays the father, perhaps most known for his role as Thurston H. on 'Gilligan's Island'), and James Dean's perhaps famous ""don't drive too fast"" segment he filmed while shooting ""Giant."" These are obviously mostly staged and scripted, but that's how they were done back int he 1950s.* Additional Scenes without Sound: The good point is that you get more scenes from this film that were cut out. You also get to see a lot more of Natalie Wood and James Dean. The alternate ending is also included (partially at least). There are also over a dozen additional scenes. The bad? There are no sounds. Not even on the color shots. They are all silent, tedious, and many of them weren't really additional scenes, they seemed to be extra footage. Do we really want to watch 8 long scenes of people leaving or hanging around the Planetarium? Or James Dean, who can barely be seen, just gazing up at some big contraption in the Planetarium? Or watch an intense scene like the alternate ending ... without any sound? Or kids driving their cars into the school's parking lot? This was nice, we all love additional scenes, but it was rather pointless.*Rare Screen Test: Basically, the main three, Wood, Mineo, Dean, as they were in the mansion toward the end of the film. It's okay, I didn't find it that different from what was in the film.*Wadrobe Tests: The actors are trying on different coats, standing around, trying not to look so stuffy and attempting to be friendly toward one another. It's fun to watch James Dean kid around, but that's just about it from this feature.As for how the film itself looks, it's great. The transfer, reportedly new, is wonderful. You'll see, in the opening main menu and in features, the original film as it was seen in theaters; blurry, muted colors, dark, gritty. None of that here. It's vivid, intense, modern looking. The soundtrack for the most part is good. I'd say the film is at it's best in this Special Edition format.So, buy this edition. More features, a better film quality, more bang for the buck. Definately worth your time and attention. Everyone should own this piece of Hollwyood history.",4,"""Special Editing"" Full of Extras",1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,5002,"['can', 'read', 'dozens', 'not', 'hundreds', 'reviews', 'Rebel',

327973,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6302685141,Austin Somlo,"[1, 1]","Viewed: 5/05, 1/14Rate: 91/14: Although the problems of the three young characters were nebulous and trivial, Rebel Without a Cause was highly fascinating because of James Dean. I realized that by the way he acted, moved, and did things, he was breaking through the barriers almost no actors had ever done before or ever since. Marlon Brando defined the Method acting, and James Dean took it to another level. Surely, and without a question, James Dean abused a lot of the rules about human conventions because everything he was doing in Rebel Without a Cause was unthinkable and not really practiced nowadays. Yet he influenced a generation in his time to emulate him. On other hand, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo were all right; it was becoming evident that their acting was elevated in the presence of James Dean. If I had to pick, East of Eden was the best work he had done. Nevertheless, I still liked what James Dean did in Rebel Without a Cause. Nicholas Ray was the Gus Van Sant of his time, and he made really nice films of the juvenile delinquent genre. One interesting note about the empty pool in the film was that it's the same pool where William Holden's character was found dead in Sunset Boulevard. All in all, because of his untimely death, James Dean is forever an icon, and Rebel Without a Cause exemplifies that.",5,The Iconic Performance of James Dean.,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,1329,"['Viewed', '5/05', '1/14Rate', '91/14', 'problems', 'three', 'young', 'characters', 'were', 'nebulous', 'trivial', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'was', 'highly', 'fascinating', 'James', 'Dean', 'realized', 'way', 'acted', 'moved', 'did', 'things', 'was', 'breaking', 'barriers', 'almost', 'actors', 'had', 'ever', 'done', 'ever', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'defined', 'Method', 'acting', 'James', 'Dean', 'took', 'level', 'Surely', 'question', 'James', 'Dean', 'abused', 'lot', 'rules', 'human', 'conventions', 'everything', 'was', 'doing', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'was', 'unthinkable', 'not', 'really', 'practiced', 'nowadays', 'influenced', 'generation', 'time', 'emulate', 'other', 'hand', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'were', 'right', 'was', 'becoming', 'evident', 'acting', 'was', 'elevated', 'presence', 'James', 'Dean', 'had', 'pick', 'East', 'Eden', 'was', 'best', 'work', 'had', 'done', 'Nevertheless', 'still', 'liked', 'what', 'James', 'Dean', 'did', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'Nicholas', 'Ray', 'was', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'time', 'made', 'really', 'nice', 'films', 'juvenile', 'delinquent', 'genre', 'One', 'interesting', 'note', 'empty', 'pool', 'film', 'was', 'same', 'pool', 'where', 'William', 'Holden', 'character', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'untimely', 'death', 'James', 'Dean', 'forever', 'icon', 'Rebel', 'Cause']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS
327974,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,6302685141,Barry C. Chow,"[3, 4]","Someone called this movie &quot;The Quintessential American Film&quot;. Such hyperbole is not far off the mark. Only in America could the hapless lives of a bunch of spoiled brats be turned into fodder for a mannered story of hand-wringing teenage existential angst. Elsewhere, teenagers are too busily engaged in the business of living and surviving to indulge in the navel gazing so blithely practiced by the young people in this film.I don't mean to say that this is a bad film. It is a great film, a classic film, but for reasons the very antithesis of those cited by its admirers. It is great because it exposes everything that is wrong with American youth: the self-centredness, the self-pity, the lack of self-motivation, the blaming-everyone-but-themselves mindset. It's all there, for those honest enough to see it; and it's all encapsulated in a bunch of misfits so full of themselves that they cannot see beyond the confines of their own paltry little universes.A lot has been written over the years about James Dean's performance. But whether or not he or Natalie Wood or Sal Mineo overplayed their roles is beside the point. What is important is that they effectively conveyed the emptiness in the lives of suburban youth. This film is not a classic because it made Dean an icon, or because his real death would soon immortalize his fictional character, but because of the skill with which insignificant lives were vested with seeming significance. In many ways, this film can be considered the progenitor of the grunge realism school of cinema, a school that persists to the present day and has spawned the pretentious art house films that infest university campuses all over the world.This film could only exist in a world where affluence is so commonplace that it is taken for granted, where life is so self-centred that aimlessness can be elevated to the status of tragedy, and where thrills are so cheap that the jaded can only feel alive by promoting risks that take them to the edge of death. This film gave rise to innumerable games of chicken, knife fight scenes and squint eyed antiheroes mumbling nihilistic doggerel, but it has also suffered from being considered nothing more than the sum of such stylistic devices. In reality, it is an unwitting indictment of American youth, and viewed as such, it achieves a significance that is wholly unintentional.",5,Unwitting Indictment of American Youth,1069200000,"11 19, 2003",2003,2379,"['Someone', 'called', 'movie', 'quot', 'Quintessential', 'American', 'Film', 'quot', 'Such', 'hyperbole', 'not', 'far', 'mark', 'Only', 'America', 'could', 'hapless', 'lives', 'bunch', 'spoiled', 'brats', 'be', 'turned', 'fodder', 'mannered', 'story', 'hand-wringing', 'teenage', 'existential', 'angst', 'Elsewhere', 'teenagers', 'are', 'too', 'busily', 'engaged', 'business', 'living', 'surviving', 'indulge', 'navel', 'gazing', 'so', 'blithely', 'practiced', 'young', 'people', 'film.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'say', 'bad', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'classic', 'film', 'reasons', 'very', 'antithesis', 'cited', 'admirers', 'great', 'everything', 'wrong', 'American', 'youth', 'self-centredness', 'self-pity', 'lack', 'self-motivation', 'blaming-everyone-but-themselves', 'mindset', 'there', 'honest', 'enough', 'see', 'encapsulated', 'bunch', 'misfits', 'so', 'full', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'confines', 'own', 'paltry', 'little', 'universes.A', 'lot', 'been', 'written', 'years', 'James', 'Dean', 'performance', 'not', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'overplayed', 'roles', 'point', 'What', 'important', 'effectively', 'conveyed', 'emptiness', 'lives', 'suburban', 'youth', 'film', 'not', 'classic', 'made', 'Dean', 'icon', 'real', 'death', 'would', 'soon', 'immortalize', 'fictional', 'character', 'skill', 'insignificant', 'lives', 'were', 'vested', 'seeming', 'significance', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'progenitor', 'grunge', 'realism', 'school', 'cinema', 'school', 'present', 'day', 'spawned', 'pretentious', 'art', 'house', 'films', 'infest', 'university', 'campuses', 'world.This', 'film', 'could', 'only', 'exist', 'world', 'where', 'affluence', 'so', 'commonplace', 'taken', 'granted', 'where', 'life', 'so', 'self-centred', 'aimlessness', 'can', 'be', 'elevated', 'status', 'tragedy', 'where', 'thrills', 'are', 'so', 'cheap', 'jaded', 'can', 'only', 'feel', 'alive', 'promoting', 'risks', 'take', 'edge', 'death', 'film', 'gave', 'rise', 'innumerable', 'games', 'chicken', 'knife', 'fight', 'scenes', 'squint', 'eyed', 'mumbling', 'nihilistic', 'doggerel', 'also', 'suffered', 'being', 'considered', 'nothing', 'more', 'sum', 'such', 'stylistic', 'devices', 'reality', 'unwitting', 'indictment', 'American', 'youth', 'viewed', 'such', 'significance', 'wholly', 'unintentional']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

327979,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,6302685141,Bomojaz,"[0, 1]","A film ""classic"" about teenage alienation and angst that spoke to a generation, but not the masterpiece many make it out to be. James Dean is Jim Starr, a high school senior with overbearing, out-of-touch parents (Jim Backus plays his father, who walks around the house in an apron - a symbol of his ""weakness as a man""), new in town, trying to fit in with the crowd. The movie addresses all the concerns of teenagers in the mid-1950s (maybe even of all time): parents, authority, friendship, loyalty, proving oneself, searching for values), but the tone the movie takes is only on par with a soap opera.

They are bare-bones releases of classic movies sold at a discount to introduce classic film to the masses. That is a good idea, and for that I salute Warner Home Video. This set is about romantic dramas, with an emphasis on the works of Tennessee Williams and James Dean. The following are the contents of this set:East of Eden (1955) - Directed by Elia Kazan and starring James Dean. Adam Trask is a California farmer with two sons - Aron and Cal. Cal feels that his father holds him in only medium esteem while he gushes over Aron. Cal also learns what really happened to his mother, and begins visiting her. When Adam loses a fortune in a failed shipping venture, Cal decides to win Adam's favor by going into business himself and getting his father's money back. However, he decides to go to his mother to get his start-up capital.Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) - Directed by Richard Brooks, stars Paul Newman as Brick and Elizabeth Taylor as his wife, Maggie. Brick is an alcoholic ex-football hero who has the favor of his father, played by Burl Ives. Brick's older brother does everything the way his father says to do it, but still does not have his father's heart. The problems in this disfunctional family rise to the surface when it is learned that ""Big Daddy"" doesn't have long to live.Streetcar Named Desire (1951) - Directed by Elia Kazan starring Marlon Brando as Stanley, the brutish bridegroom of Stella (Kim Hunter). Stella has an older sister Blanche (Vivien Leigh) who acts as though she is a southern belle rather than an aging woman with a dreary existence in the French quarter of New Orleans. When Stanley hears Blanche encouraging Stella to leave him, he plots a cruel revenge.Rebel Without a Cause (1955) - Directed by Nicholas Rey, stars James Dean and Natalie Wood in a film that is more about the disenchantment of the modern teenager with society than it is a romantic drama classic. It's a different kind of romance. At face value you could say the two wind up together because they both feel so alone, but there is a real chemistry and attachment there that is beyond just emotional survival.These romantic dramas are often more dramatic than romantic, but they are all five stars. As is common in this Warner series, these films have more deluxe editions in DVD sets if you are interested. For fans of James Dean, his two films can be found inThe Complete James Dean Collection (East of Eden / Giant / Rebel Without a Cause Special Edition). The sad thing is, with the exception of a few cameos and TV appearances, this really is the complete James Dean collection. As for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Streetcar Named Desire, they are both in more deluxe versions  on the excellentTennessee Williams Film Collection (A Streetcar Named Desire 1951 Two-Disc Special Edition / Cat on a Hot Tin Roof 1958 Deluxe Edition / Sweet Bird of Youth / The Night of the Iguana / Baby Doll / The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone).",5,Four top-drawer romantic classics in an economical package,1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,3039,"['one', 'first', 'what', 'planned', 'be', '27', 'sets', 'four', 'films', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'are', 'bare-bones', 'releases', 'classic', 'movies', 'sold', 'discount', 'introduce', 'classic', 'film', 'masses', 'good', 'idea', 'salute', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'set', 'romantic', 'dramas', 'emphasis', 'works', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'James', 'Dean', 'following', 'are', 'contents', 'set', 'East', 'Eden', '1955', 'Directed', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'starring', 'James', 'Dean', 'Adam', 'Trask', 'California', 'farmer', 'two', 'sons', 'Aron', 'Cal', 'Cal', 'feels', 'father', 'only', 'medium', 'esteem', 'Aron', 'Cal', 'also', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'mother', 'visiting', 'When', 'Adam', 'fortune', 'failed', 'shipping', 'venture', 'Cal', 'win', 'Adam', 'favor', 'going', 'business', 'getting', 'father', 'money', 'back', 'However', 'go', 'mother', 'get', 'start-up', 'capital.Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', '1958', 'Directed', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Brick', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'Brick', 'alcoholic', 'ex-football', 'hero', 'who', 'favor', 'father', 'played', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'Brick', 'older', 'brother', 'everything', 'way', 'father', 'do', 'still', 'not', 'have', 'father', 'heart', 'problems', 'disfunctional', 'family', 'rise', 'surface', 'when', 'learned', 'Big', 'Daddy', ""n't"", 'have', 'long', 'live.Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', '1951', 'Directed', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'starring', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Stanley', 'brutish', 'bridegroom', 'Stella', 'Kim', 'Hunter', 'Stella', 'older', 'sister', 'Blanche', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'who', 'southern', 'belle', 'rather', 'aging', 'woman', 'dreary', 'existence', 'French', 'quarter', 'New', 'Orleans', 'When', 'Stanley', 'Blanche', 'encouraging', 'Stella', 'leave', 'cruel', 'revenge.Rebel', 'Cause', '1955', 'Directed', 'Nicholas', 'Rey', 'James', 'Dean', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'film', 'more', 'disenchantment', 'modern', 'teenager', 'society', 'romantic', 'drama', 'classic', 'different', 'kind', 'romance', 'face', 'value', 'could', 'say', 'two', 'wind', 'up', 'together', 'feel', 'so', 'alone', 'real', 'chemistry', 'attachment', 'there', 'just', 'emotional', 'survival.These', 'romantic', 'dramas', 'are', 'often', 'more', 'dramatic', 'romantic', 'are', 'five', 'stars', 'common', 'Warner', 'series', 'films', 'have', 'more', 'deluxe', 'editions', 'DVD', 'sets', 'are', 'interested', 'fans', 'James', 'Dean', 'two', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'inThe', 'Complete', 'James', 'Dean', 'Collection', 'East', 'Eden', '/', 'Giant', '/', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'Special', 'Edition', 'sad', 'thing', 'exception', 'few', 'cameos', 'TV', 'appearances', 'really', 'complete', 'James', 'Dean', 'collection', 'Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'are', 'more', 'deluxe', 'versions', 'excellentTennessee', 'Williams', 'Film', 'Collection', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', '1951', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', '/', 'Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', '1958', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', '/', 'Sweet', 'Bird', 'Youth', '/', 'Night', 'Iguana', '/', 'Baby', 'Doll', '/', 'Roman', 'Spring', 'Mrs.', 'Stone']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

I remember the hubub about the TV miniseries in the early 80s, and I guess that planted the impression on my young mind that it's a trashy sudser akin to Harold Robbins (what else was I to think from all those ""parental guidance"" warnings?).  And now 20 years after that, I'm surprised that I have hardly seen anything written about this original version in all the books and articles I have read on movies.  Because it is so GREAT!  I was socked in the gut by this one.It is not easy for films to move me on a deep level, but this one sure did.  It was the first time in quite a while that a movie made me really cry and feel it.  The scene where James Dean finally tries to buy his father's love--though thinking it's the right thing to do--and realizes his futility, is stunning.  He becomes so overwhelmed with pain that he even tries to hug his father.  It's one of the most wrenching moments ever captured on film.  This moment is so great and so powerful that if it doesn't get to the core of one's being, then I don't know what will.  That brilliant cinematic moment then leads to a series of extraordinary events that makes for dynamite suspense and storytelling (no I haven't read the book yet).But aside from the cinematic brilliance of ""East Of Eden"" (the extraordinay cast, namely Mr. James Dean, whose legend now makes complete sense after seeing this; the set pieces, the script, the direction), it ultimately is a heartwrenching look at our most primal need in human life:  a desperate, innate need for our parents' love.This one will hit you hard, so be prepared.",5,Incredibly powerful and important,1031529600,"09 9, 2002",2002,1690,"['Being', 'film', 'buff', 'was', 'teen', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'took', 'was', '31', 'finally', 'see', 'East', 'Eden', 'remember', 'hubub', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'early', '80s', 'guess', 'planted', 'impression', 'young', 'mind', 'trashy', 'sudser', 'akin', 'Harold', 'Robbins', 'what', 'else', 'was', 'think', 'parental', 'guidance', 'warnings', 'now', '20', 'years', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'have', 'hardly', 'seen', 'anything', 'written', 'original', 'version', 'books', 'articles', 'have', 'read', 'movies', 'so', 'GREAT', 'was', 'socked', 'gut', 'one.It', 'not', 'easy', 'films', 'move', 'deep', 'level', 'one', 'sure', 'did', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'quite', 'while', 'movie', 'made', 'really', 'cry', 'feel', 'scene', 'where', 'James', 'Dean', 'finally', 'buy', 'father', 'love', 'thinking', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'realizes', 'futility', 'stunning', 'so', 'overwhelmed', 'pain', 'even', 'hug', 'father', 'one', 'most', 'wrenching', 'moments', 'ever', 'captured', 'film', 'moment', 'so', 'great', 'so', 'powerful', ""n't"", 'get', 'core', 'one', 'being', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'will', 'brilliant', 'cinematic', 'moment', 'then', 'series', 'extraordinary', 'events', 'dynamite', 'suspense', 'storytelling', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'yet', '.But', 'aside', 'cinematic', 'brilliance', 'East', 'Eden', 'extraordinay', 'cast', 'namely', 'Mr.', 'James', 'Dean', 'legend', 'now', 'complete', 'sense', 'seeing', 'set', 'pieces', 'script', 'direction', 'ultimately', 'heartwrenching', 'look', 'most', 'primal', 'need', 'human', 'life', 'desperate', 'innate', 'need', 'parents', 'love.This', 'one', 'will', 'hit', 'hard', 'so', 'be', 'prepared']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

Its message is ageless and is almost saddening to think that after all this time the issues relevent in the film have yet to be socially adressed, adults still dont emote with their kids, and kids still have trouble fitting in to the pecking order laid down by our supposed betters.

Older photos had a lit cigarette dangling from his lips.  Images like that NEVER appealed to me and therefore, neither did this film. Never had any interest in seeing it.  And I would not.  But one night, some 22 years or more back, I was up, couldn't sleep, around 2 a.m., flipping through the (then fewer) cable channels.  NOTHING good was on the tv. I stumbled across this film.  Didn't know what it was. I said, oh, so this is the famous James Dean, eh, and started watching just out of curiosity.  WITHIN MINUTES, I was addicted to this story and could not, would not, turn away.  The acting was incredible, so convincing I forgot that I was looking at James Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo.  These performers went beyond amazing. These characters came to life.  I had to close my door in case any in my family got up and walked by my door because, several times in this film, I, a grown man, was sobbing.  I don't mind admitting to that, but it was a reaction, especially to a movie I had heretofore had no interest at all in seeing, a reaction that I never expected.  Quite unexpectedly, one night over 22 years ago, I unexpectedly discovered one of the most beautiful and touching films I have ever seen in my entire life.  REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE will always remain a beloved favorite of mine. The story is gripping and gut-wrenching and the actors (now all sadly having passed on) give utterly unforgettable performances. If you have never seen this film, by all means do.  And if you have, and don't have a copy of it yet, then you KNOW you need to get one.  I cannot recommend this film highly enough.

Never mind the sops to convention that compromise the film's ultimate force. Instead it's there on screen, in the Dean persona, the hesitant gesture, the understanding smile, and a sensitivity that at times becomes achingly, painfully real. Dean didn't play Jim Stark, he was Jim Stark. How fortunate that this avatar of teenage angst was paired with director Nicholas Ray, the patron saint of 50's youth. Together they lift the material to classic heights, such that a bust of Dean now appears at Griffith Observatory (the site of the knife fight) in Los Angeles.

Most reviewerers see this as a great movie ""Vehicle"" for Dean and Sal Minio. Natalie Wood takes a ""back seat"" view in this movie...She will for ever be my most favortite movie star of all time. Its interesting that all three had a short, violent death...Dean in his famous Car Wreck, Sal Minio Stabed, still in his early years, and Natalie a mysterious drowning which details were never fully disclosed...fell in the water, Drowned...end of story. But after THIS movie, she went on to make wounderful movies: West Side Story, Splendor In The Grass: WOW!..Her emotional talent range was fantastic! Natalie and Elizabeth Taylor, whom had a close reseblance, I heard once, their identity was often confused by vieweres in that era. Of course Taylors Greater talent and..wild public life, placed HER in the main spotlight, for ever. But next time you see this movie try to see the emotion and depth that Natalie put into it.

327995,A35J4XGRWXVZ00,6302685141,Edward,"[8, 11]","...As for &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, people today who expect to smirk through a hopelessly outdated &quot;problem picture&quot; have a surprise in store. Granted, the high school students smoke nothing but cigarettes and their language is necessarily antiseptic (the Hays Code was still in force), but the movie has a tough, angst-ridden quality that should appeal even to today's young generation. Most of this is due to James Dean,who was without a doubt before his time. He captures his character Jim Stark in the opening shot (behind the credits) when he literally stumbles across a toy monkey and, covering it carefully with a scrap of paper, curls up beside it in the fetal position. In the following police precinct sequence when he drunkenly hums &quot;The Ride of the Valkyries&quot; (a reference to his mother and grandmother?) or furiously pummels a desk, he vitalizes the screen in a manner few actors have before or since. His supporting players Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo (who really were teenagers -- Dean was in his early twenties) would probably not have left such a strong impression had they not been working with such an impetus. Natalie Wood is Judy, the confused girl next door: her father is obviously having difficulty dealing with her increased nubility. Sal Mineo's Plato is a nervous, potentially violent boy whose feelings for Jim Stark may or may not be filial. Plato's sexual orientation is never explored; but he keeps a picture of Alan Ladd in his locker, and when punks steal his address book they find only boys' names listed. Evidently the remarkable thing about this story for contemporary audiences was that all the despair and dysfunction was not taking place in the slums but in the whitewashed all-WASP suburbs.The high school student body (which includes Corey Allen, Nick Adams, and a squeaky-clean Dennis Hopper) has not a single black person. The implication is of affluence without honest affection, which of course became a &quot;troubled youth&quot; clich&eacute;; and, despite Nicholas Ray's hip direction, &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; without James Dean would be just another such clich&eacute; It's Dean's sensational presence that makes this a classic picture, one that has as much punch today as when it was first released.",4,A &quot;Rebel&quot; with effect,997315200,"08 9, 2001",2001,2288,"['quot', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'quot', 'people', 'today', 'who', 'expect', 'smirk', 'hopelessly', 'outdated', 'quot', 'problem', 'picture', 'quot', 'have', 'surprise', 'store', 'Granted', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'smoke', 'nothing', 'cigarettes', 'language', 'necessarily', 'antiseptic', 'Hays', 'Code', 'was', 'still', 'force', 'movie', 'tough', 'angst-ridden', 'quality', 'should', 'appeal', 'even', 'today', 'young', 'generation', 'Most', 'due', 'James', 'Dean', 'who', 'was', 'doubt', 'time', 'character', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'opening', 'shot', 'credits', 'when', 'literally', 'toy', 'monkey', 'covering', 'carefully', 'scrap', 'paper', 'up', 'fetal', 'position', 'following', 'police', 'precinct', 'sequence', 'when', 'drunkenly', 'hums', 'quot', 'Ride', 'Valkyries', 'quot', 'reference', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'furiously', 'desk', 'screen', 'manner', 'few', 'actors', 'have', 'supporting', 'players', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'who', 'really', 'were', 'teenagers', 'Dean', 'was', 'early', 'twenties', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'have', 'left', 'strong', 'impression', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'working', 'impetus', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Judy', 'confused', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'father', 'obviously', 'having', 'difficulty', 'dealing', 'increased', 'nubility', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'Plato', 'nervous', 'potentially', 'violent', 'boy', 'feelings', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'filial', 'Plato', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'never', 'explored', 'picture', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'locker', 'when', 'punks', 'steal', 'address', 'book', 'find', 'only', 'boys', 'names', 'listed', 'Evidently', 'remarkable', 'thing', 'story', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'was', 'despair', 'dysfunction', 'was', 'not', 'taking', 'place', 'slums', 'whitewashed', 'all-WASP', 'suburbs.The', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'body', 'Corey', 'Allen', 'Nick', 'Adams', 'squeaky-clean', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'not', 'single', 'black', 'person', 'implication', 'affluence', 'honest', 'affection', 'course', 'became', 'quot', 'troubled', 'youth', 'quot', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Nicholas', 'Ray', 'hip', 'direction', 'quot', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'quot', 'James', 'Dean', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'such', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Dean', 'sensational', 'presence', 'classic', 'picture', 'one', 'as', 'much', 'punch', 'today', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

327997,A15BHDNAUEBEKP,6302685141,Evelina,"[2, 3]","typically people say that the movie predicted the rise of alienated youth of the sixties, disgusted with the hypocritical, repressive past, but nothing is said about the male/female dynamics. That aspect of the movie does not fit with the rebellious youth aspect, so it is ignored. To someone who sees it after reading about it for many years, that part was a surprise.My father wants to be my pal, Jim (Dean) says to the policemen in the beginning.  Jim says, I love him, I don't want to hurt him, but obviously, Jim does not want a pal but a father with authority.It seems strange to us now, but in the fifties many were concerned that the American female was emasculating the American male. Many wrote about it. Sociologists and other intellectual types thought it was a real problem.Jim (Dean) complains that his mother eats his father alive, and if he only had the guts to knock Mom cold once, maybe she would be happy and she'd stop picking on the father. Jim identifies his father's weakness as causing his mother's discontent. His father does not inspire respect. He is not masculine. The more the father gives in to the mother, the more she despises him. Also, the grandmother continually knocks the father. The weak male is surrounded by strong hostile females. The feminist explanation would be that the woman is frustrated by not having a career.How extensive female or societal hostility towards males was in the fifties, I don't know. It exists today. The more liberated women become and the more they get men to agree with their feminist goals, the more the women have contempt for the men. It is one of the great ironies of feminism.Jim says, I don't want to be like my father. When he sees his father wearing an apron, the look on his face is priceless and here Dean does a great bit of acting. He registers a mixture of love, pity, anger, contempt. He smiles at his father, but you can see he wants to cry. Strange to think that in a few years, men would be encouraged to do just what Jim's father was doing. Jim is humiliated for his father. His father drops a tray and is anxious. Stand up, his son tells him, what can happen if she sees it? The son cannot bear that the father fears the mother.Jim tries to get his father to tell him what to do about being called chicken. Should Jim defend his honor? Is that what a man does? His father has no answer. He can't tell him take the challenge. He can't tell him ignore those kids, they're wrong. So Jim goes to defend his honor. He realizes his life at the school would be unsupportable with the reputation of ""chicken.""  Later, when he decides to go to the police, he begs his father to support him against his mother. Tell her, he says, Stand up for me, Dad. His father, weak, indecisive, does not.The movie does not explicitly say whether upholding honor is wrong or right. The whole chickie run is a waste of energy and leads to a young man's demise. At the same time, the audience is intended to respect Jim for taking the challenge.In the end, Jim has a sort of happy ending. His father becomes stronger, You can depend on me, son, he says. Trust me. I'll be as strong as you want me to be. The mother smiles through her tears, seemingly accepting that her husband has a special role as father.The issues raised have not been resolved. They are more pressing than ever. The old definition of manly honor is gone, not for most of the world, to be sure, but for the west. But then what is it to be a man? Is he really supposed to be the same as a woman? Is there no masculine quality or strength that is unique to the sex?",5,The emasculation of the father,1314316800,"08 26, 2011",2011,3594,"['typically', 'people', 'say', 'movie', 'predicted', 'rise', 'alienated', 'youth', 'sixties', 'disgusted', 'hypocritical', 'repressive', 'past', 'nothing', 'said', 'male/female', 'dynamics', 'aspect', 'movie', 'not', 'fit', 'rebellious', 'youth', 'aspect', 'ignored', 'someone', 'who', 'reading', 'many', 'years', 'part', 'was', 'surprise.My', 'father', 'be', 'pal', 'Jim', 'Dean', 'policemen', 'beginning', 'Jim', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hurt', 'obviously', 'Jim', 'not', 'want', 'pal', 'father', 'authority.It', 'strange', 'now', 'fifties', 'many', 'were', 'concerned', 'American', 'female', 'was', 'emasculating', 'American', 'male', 'Many', 'wrote', 'Sociologists', 'other', 'intellectual', 'types', 'thought', 'was', 'real', 'problem.Jim', 'Dean', 'mother', 'father', 'alive', 'only', 'had', 'guts', 'knock', 'Mom', 'cold', 'once', 'maybe', 'would', 'be', 'happy', ""'d"", 'stop', 'picking', 'father', 'Jim', 'father', 'weakness', 'causing', 'mother', 'discontent', 'father', 'not', 'inspire', 'respect', 'not', 'masculine', 'more', 'father', 'mother', 'more', 'Also', 'grandmother', 'continually', 'father', 'weak', 'male', 'surrounded', 'strong', 'hostile', 'females', 'feminist', 'explanation', 'would', 'be', 'woman', 'frustrated', 'not', 'having', 'career.How', 'extensive', 'female', 'societal', 'hostility', 'towards', 'males', 'was', 'fifties', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'today', 'more', 'liberated', 'women', 'become', 'more', 'get', 'men', 'agree', 'feminist', 'goals', 'more', 'women', 'have', 'contempt', 'men', 'one', 'great', 'ironies', 'feminism.Jim', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'father', 'When', 'father', 'wearing', 'apron', 'look', 'face', 'priceless', 'here', 'Dean', 'great', 'bit', 'acting', 'mixture', 'love', 'pity', 'anger', 'contempt', 'father', 'can', 'see', 'cry', 'Strange', 'think', 'few', 'years', 'men', 'would', 'be', 'encouraged', 'do', 'just', 'what', 'Jim', 'father', 'was', 'doing', 'Jim', 'humiliated', 'father', 'father', 'tray', 'anxious', 'Stand', 'up', 'son', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'son', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'father', 'mother.Jim', 'get', 'father', 'tell', 'what', 'do', 'being', 'called', 'chicken', 'Should', 'Jim', 'defend', 'honor', 'what', 'man', 'father', 'answer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'take', 'challenge', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'ignore', 'kids', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'So', 'Jim', 'defend', 'honor', 'life', 'school', 'would', 'be', 'unsupportable', 'reputation', 'chicken', 'Later', 'when', 'go', 'police', 'father', 'support', 'mother', 'Tell', 'Stand', 'up', 'Dad', 'father', 'weak', 'indecisive', 'not.The', 'movie', 'not', 'explicitly', 'say', 'upholding', 'honor', 'wrong', 'right', 'whole', 'chickie', 'run', 'waste', 'energy', 'young', 'man', 'demise', 'same', 'time', 'audience', 'intended', 'respect', 'Jim', 'taking', 'challenge.In', 'end', 'Jim', 'sort', 'happy', 'ending', 'father', 'stronger', 'can', 'depend', 'son', 'Trust', ""'ll"", 'be', 'as', 'strong', 'want', 'be', 'mother', 'tears', 'seemingly', 'accepting', 'husband', 'special', 'role', 'father.The', 'issues', 'raised', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'resolved', 'are', 'more', 'pressing', 'ever', 'old', 'definition', 'manly', 'honor', 'gone', 'not', 'most', 'world', 'be', 'sure', 'west', 'then', 'what', 'be', 'man', 'really', 'supposed', 'be', 'same', 'woman', 'there', 'masculine', 'quality', 'strength', 'unique', 'sex']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

Just like the more modern tv drama ""The O.C."" this film shows that behind the clean facade of rich, well-to-do neighbourhoods lies the broken pieces of parents who are unable to relate to their children who in turn end up looking for this missing love and understanding in all the wrong places with violent and destructive effects.Dean's character is ashamed of his father who in his eyes is hen-pecked and cowardly and he insists upon good answers from his father as to why he is feeling the typical hormone-induced depression that most teenagers go through and when that is not forthcoming, he rebels in an attempt to hurt his parents.  Wood's character is similar in that she also has communication problems with her father who is uncomfortable with physical closeness now that his daughter has become an attractive teen perhaps in an over-reaction to his own incestual desires?  Confused at his behaviour Wood's character believes her father hates her and so she too rebels in an attempt to hurt him.  Mineo's character is the most pitiful and perhaps most deserving of sympathy; his parents are divorced and they truly appear not to care about him at all leaving him alone with a live-in maid as sole companion.

Crofford ""Travis 76""","[2, 3]","It comes very far and few where a movie is as good as its novel or sometimes even better, ""East of Eden"" is one of those movies. All though the film takes place where the novel would be 3/4 done, the film incudes a lot that the novel doesn't. The film starts with that intense music at first, then as the credits go on, it becomes more soothing. After the credits, the film cuts to the chase, it has Cal (James Dean in his film debute) following his suspected mother, Kate (Jo Van Fleet in her oscar winning role), in those first twentie minutes of the film, we are set to think that Cal is a stalker, then as the film goes on to when Cal starts working for his dad (Raymond Massey) we still don't understand him, but we are also no longer afraid of him. And as the film goes on some more we come to like Cal a lot. Soon we see him kissing his brothers girl (Julie Harris), it is like a casual on screen love affair. Not fifteen minutes after that part we grow sorry for Cal. Then after we have come all of this way to respect and love Cal, he becomes decieving, as if it were the temtations of the devil. IT was brilliant that all of these great moments had been cought on camera, it was Dean acting out his lifes story and it was so breath taking how we were there to see it. Over the years ""East of Eden"" had became a classic, it remained unforgettable. However Warner Brose. has not recognized the magic ""East of Eden"" had brought, so they had stopped print on it over the years. As the film is tapes is groweing old and we see that film deteriorating, we are now only seeing half the magic that ""East of Eden"" could bring to us, and it has also been a long time since the film was seen in the widescreen format, if only it had been released, people would finally capter that magic that ""East of eden"" had brought to the world forty-seven years ago.

However, things go horribly wrong when a game of Chicken between Stark and one of the greasers ends in the greaser's death.Although not the first cinematic depiction of the 1950's youth culture (""The Wild One"" was made two years earlier), ""Rebel Without a Cause"" is one of the best of these such films. Unlike ""The Wild One"", which barely even had a plot, ""Rebel Without a Cause"" has a strong storyline which would probably still work if it were remade today, and Jim Stark is a far more realistic character than Brando's Johnny Strabler. It is essentially a coming of age film, chronicling Jim Stark's transition from irresponsible teenager, to adulthood, as he is effectively forced to become a ""parent"" to a troubled young friend of his, who sees him as a hero.As it was made in the 50's, many of the characters feel as though they were taken straight out of ""Grease"" (for example, the greasers, who appear to comb their hair every two seconds), which makes the film somewhat laughable to begin with, but as the film progresses and takes a serious turn, you forget this pretty quickly. Jim Stark, however, with his iconic red jacket and a cigarette hanging from his mouth, still seems as cool as he must have seemed in 1955, and after seeing this film, I finally understand why James Dean's legend has lived on for more than 50 years after his death.",5,Still cool 50 years later,1234915200,"02 18, 2009",2009,1459,"['Teenaged', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'James', 'Dean', 'just', 'moved', 'new', 'town', 'fit', 'local', 'greasers', 'However', 'things', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'when', 'game', 'Chicken', 'Stark', 'one', 'greasers', 'greaser', 'not', 'first', 'cinematic', 'depiction', '1950', 'youth', 'culture', 'Wild', 'One', 'was', 'made', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'one', 'best', 'such', 'films', 'Wild', 'One', 'barely', 'even', 'had', 'plot', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'strong', 'storyline', 'would', 'probably', 'still', 'work', 'were', 'remade', 'today', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'character', 'Brando', 'Johnny', 'Strabler', 'essentially', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'chronicling', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'transition', 'irresponsible', 'teenager', 'adulthood', 'effectively', 'forced', 'become', 'parent', 'troubled', 'young', 'friend', 'who', 'hero.As', 'was', 'made', '50', 'many', 'characters', 'feel', 'were', 'taken', 'straight', 'Grease', 'example', 'greasers', 'who', 'appear', 'comb', 'hair', 'two', 'seconds', 'film', 'somewhat', 'laughable', 'begin', 'film', 'progresses', 'serious', 'turn', 'forget', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'however', 'iconic', 'red', 'jacket', 'cigarette', 'hanging', 'mouth', 'still', 'as', 'cool', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', '1955', 'seeing', 'film', 'finally', 'understand', 'why', 'James', 'Dean', 'legend', 'lived', 'more', '50', 'years', 'death']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

He is the sensitive soul misunderstood by parents and the society that surrounds him.  His efforts to fit in with other students fail and this leads to problems.  Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo turn in realistic portrayals of teenagers without a cause.  This film shows a darker side of the '50s than the vision espoused by the Happy Days sitcom.  These kids are feeling a lot of alienation and angst.  This is Seattle grunge 40 years before Eddie Vedder and Kurt Cobain.  The pain they feel is very real.  The screenplay by Stewart Stern reveals great sympathy towards these kids.  They are good kids who have gone bad because they don't fit in.  People always tell you that the high school years are the best years of your life.  That isn't true for all kids, however, as this film poignantly illustrates.  It is heartbreaking but powerful.

328004,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,6302685141,Get What We Give,"[2, 3]","Prior to ""Rebel Without a Cause"" there was no such thing as a ""teen flick"" (a film targeted at a teen audience).  There were films for adults and films for adults and children, and then there were kiddie pictures.  ""Rebel"" broke the mold and nothing's been the same ever again.""Rebel"" was released after Dean's death, but is probably the most popular of his three films.  It is certainly the most accessible and appreciable for even today's youth.Brando had made ""The Wild Ones,"" but Dean's ""Rebel..."" was far better received.  It is the story of ""a day in the life...of a teenager"" and that is what makes it so great!The story and the action in this film revolve around Dean's character - Jim Stark - a new kid in a new high school, just trying to fit in.  His first day he runs into Plato (Sal Mineo), the school nerd, and befriends him.  He falls for Judy (Natalie Wood), the girlfriend of the school tough guy.  In the course of this one day, he is forced to prove his worth and his manhood to not only his new classmates, but to his father and mother and the local police,  as well.Some of the most riveting scenes are:  the planetarium and when Jim, Judy, and Plato visit the old empty house.  In the planetarium we see poor Plato amazed with the confidence and bravado that Jim shows, not knowing that Jim is terrified of not fitting in and that he is grasping for position.  In the abandoned house we see Jim take his position, if only for a moment in time, as husband to Judy and father to Plato.  For as much as Judy has fallen for Jim, it is Plato who has truly fallen for Jim.  It is Plato's realization that his position as outcast can never be altered because of who and what he is. It is this realization that ultimately brings about the film's tragic ending.Today, Hollywood, it seems, has a factory that produces films only for teen audiences and they have forgotten the adults.  When ""Rebel"" was made, it was done so with an eye for adults and young adults alike.  In doing so, the film doesn't insult the viewer - regardless of age.  It also proves that drama, even for a young audience, needn't have nudity, four letter words, or blatant sex in order to tell a good story.Today, Hollywood could learn a lesson from a film over fifty years old.",4,The first teen flick - it has a bite!,1047945600,"03 18, 2003",2003,2263,"['Prior', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'was', 'such', 'thing', 'teen', 'flick', 'film', 'targeted', 'teen', 'audience', 'were', 'films', 'adults', 'films', 'adults', 'children', 'then', 'were', 'kiddie', 'pictures', 'Rebel', 'broke', 'mold', 'nothing', 'been', 'same', 'ever', 'again', 'Rebel', 'was', 'released', 'Dean', 'death', 'probably', 'most', 'popular', 'three', 'films', 'certainly', 'most', 'accessible', 'appreciable', 'even', 'today', 'youth.Brando', 'had', 'made', 'Wild', 'Ones', 'Dean', 'Rebel', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'received', 'story', 'day', 'life', 'teenager', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'story', 'action', 'film', 'revolve', 'Dean', 'character', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'new', 'kid', 'new', 'high', 'school', 'just', 'trying', 'fit', 'first', 'day', 'Plato', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'school', 'nerd', 'Judy', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'girlfriend', 'school', 'tough', 'guy', 'course', 'one', 'day', 'forced', 'prove', 'worth', 'manhood', 'not', 'only', 'new', 'classmates', 'father', 'mother', 'local', 'police', 'well.Some', 'most', 'riveting', 'scenes', 'are', 'planetarium', 'when', 'Jim', 'Judy', 'Plato', 'visit', 'old', 'empty', 'house', 'planetarium', 'see', 'poor', 'Plato', 'amazed', 'confidence', 'bravado', 'Jim', 'shows', 'not', 'knowing', 'Jim', 'terrified', 'not', 'fitting', 'grasping', 'position', 'abandoned', 'house', 'see', 'Jim', 'take', 'position', 'only', 'moment', 'time', 'husband', 'Judy', 'father', 'Plato', 'as', 'much', 'Judy', 'fallen', 'Jim', 'Plato', 'who', 'truly', 'fallen', 'Jim', 'Plato', 'realization', 'position', 'outcast', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'altered', 'who', 'what', 'realization', 'ultimately', 'film', 'tragic', 'ending.Today', 'Hollywood', 'factory', 'films', 'only', 'teen', 'audiences', 'have', 'forgotten', 'adults', 'When', 'Rebel', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'eye', 'adults', 'young', 'adults', 'alike', 'doing', 'so', 'film', ""n't"", 'insult', 'viewer', 'regardless', 'age', 'also', 'drama', 'even', 'young', 'audience', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'nudity', 'four', 'letter', 'words', 'blatant', 'sex', 'order', 'tell', 'good', 'story.Today', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'learn', 'lesson', 'film', 'fifty', 'years', 'old']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

328008,AKKSHEGRQVQRK,6302685141,Great Movie Addict,"[9, 26]","This is one of those not-that-great 50's movies that remains fascinating, if only because it remains such a sincere effort at picturing the early disintegration of family life that began in the affluent 50's, but is so  burdened with phoney method acting and bad casting (typical for the 50's),  it makes you wanna cry.  James Dean tries too hard, resulting in a very bad  impression of Brando.  Natalie Wood needed to go back to acting school, and  the over-rated Sal Mineo is so bad it's embarrassing.  The older, old-pro  actors of the period really show up the younger performers (good heavens,  even Jim Backus turns in an excellent performance!).  The writing far  exceeds the abilities of the youngsters in the cast, and the music is  phenomenally gorgeous but disappears under all the artificial acting of the  35-year-old &quot;teenagers&quot;.  It's a shame, because this film truly  had something daring to say to its Eisenhower era audience; it's no wonder  so many youngsters identified strongly with the message.  But James Dean?  He may have been a promising talent, but even if he'd lived longer, that  promise would be a long time maturing.  He is probably one of the most  irritatingly &quot;mannered&quot; actors in the Hollywood of those days,  making basic mistakes that even grammar-school drama students are trained  to avoid.  But, darn it, this is STILL a movie to be seen, and seen again,  if for no other reason than to see the early beginnings of the  counter-culture that would erupt more openly in the 60's.  One  compensation: the photography is quite good, even with that washed-out 50's  Warner-Bros. color, and the main theme music is captivating.  And the story  line and dialogue are, for its time, much better than the drivel you get in  many of today's socially 'serious' films.  I was 15 when I saw this film at  its initial release, and I can say that although it is flawed it is a  *VERY* fifties piece of work that accurately defines the culture of the  time, as well as the best and worst of that era's movie-making.",3,"Daring Stuff in the 50's, but Method Acting Dulls the Edge",942624000,"11 15, 1999",1999,2059,"['one', 'not-that-great', '50', 'movies', 'fascinating', 'only', 'such', 'sincere', 'effort', 'picturing', 'early', 'disintegration', 'family', 'life', 'began', 'affluent', '50', 'so', 'burdened', 'phoney', 'method', 'acting', 'bad', 'casting', 'typical', '50', 'wan', 'cry', 'James', 'Dean', 'too', 'hard', 'resulting', 'very', 'bad', 'impression', 'Brando', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'needed', 'go', 'back', 'acting', 'school', 'over-rated', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'so', 'bad', 'embarrassing', 'older', 'old-pro', 'actors', 'period', 'really', 'show', 'up', 'younger', 'performers', 'good', 'heavens', 'even', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'excellent', 'performance', 'writing', 'far', 'abilities', 'youngsters', 'cast', 'music', 'phenomenally', 'gorgeous', 'disappears', 'artificial', 'acting', '35-year-old', 'quot', 'teenagers', 'quot', 'shame', 'film', 'truly', 'had', 'something', 'daring', 'say', 'Eisenhower', 'era', 'audience', 'wonder', 'so', 'many', 'youngsters', 'identified', 'strongly', 'message', 'James', 'Dean', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'promising', 'talent', 'even', ""'d"", 'lived', 'longer', 'promise', 'would', 'be', 'long', 'time', 'maturing', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'irritatingly', 'quot', 'mannered', 'quot', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'making', 'basic', 'mistakes', 'even', 'grammar-school', 'drama', 'students', 'are', 'trained', 'avoid', 'darn', 'STILL', 'movie', 'be', 'seen', 'seen', 'again', 'other', 'reason', 'see', 'early', 'beginnings', 'counter-culture', 'would', 'erupt', 'more', 'openly', '60', 'One', 'compensation', 'photography', 'quite', 'good', 'even', 'washed-out', '50', 'Warner-Bros.', 'color', 'main', 'theme', 'music', 'captivating', 'story', 'line', 'dialogue', 'are', 'time', 'much', 'better', 'drivel', 'get', 'many', 'today', 'socially', ""'serious"", 'films', 'was', '15', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'initial', 'release', 'can', 'say', 'flawed', '*VERY*', 'fifties', 'piece', 'work', 'accurately', 'culture', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'best', 'worst', 'era', 'movie-making']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

328012,A26HFSVLAGULIM,6302685141,"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[2, 3]","FIRST REACTION:WOW!WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?:Basically, James Dean is the new boy on the block and it is not the first time. He seems to have some family issues and they are driving him insane. He wants to be a good boy, really, but it has not worked out that way and he really wants all the hurting to end. Jimbo [James Dean] just can't reconcile the dynamics of his family, with his father wearing an apron and agreeing to whatever his always-talking-and-never-listening mother has to say. He wants his father to stand up for him and for himself, but Dad [played by Jim Backus] just doesn't seem to have it in him.The first school night eve ends with a stop at the police station for our 3 teen leads, and it all seemed so senseless. I guess some things never change.JIM'S 1st DAY AT SCHOOL:Deans first day at school turned out to be quite a convulsive experience and Dean quickly teamed up with an interesting bunch of estranged youth. Sal Mineo as Plato suffered from the neglect of an absent mother and father while Jim floundered at the hands of ineffectual parents. Judy [Natalie Wood] was burdened by a pathologically repressed father who held his son on his lap playfully while he slapped at Judy for trying to do the same thing, stating that she was a tramp for doing it. Essentially, all of the film's parents are depicted as conformists to the values of 1950s, while at the same time harboring their own anger and discontent.That backdrop led to the ridiculous and tragic altercation between Jim and Buzz that culminated in a fatal game of chicken that evening. Jim's father [Jim Backus] just wasn't there to answer Jim when he needed answers, with blood oozing out of little knife wounds on his torso, about a question of honor.After the chicken eposode calamity, Buzz's gang somehow held Jim responsible for the death of their leader who literally sailed off a cliff in a stolen car because his jacket sleeve got caught on the door handle. This only served to escalate the nightmare, while Judy and Jim ironically were getting better acquainted.JIM'S FIRST NIGHT:Without stating the whole plot, let's just say that despite his efforts to the contrary, Jim was directly, though not criminally involved, in the violent deaths of two of his classmates.BOTTOM LINE:At the end of their first full day, Jim and Judy's situation seemed well on the way toward a possible mending. Plato's situation was settled in a final way, so to speak, though not happily, an example of what absentee parenting ultimately brings, whereas Jim's parents, though ineffectual are seemingly on the verge of an epiphany of sorts. Mother seems almost ready to listen and dad is ready to take off the apron and stand by his troubled son. This time they not going to move away. They are going to stay and face their issues and, for the first time, have a chance to work through things. And Judy's parents? ---- We'll see!AN INTERESTING UNDERLYING TWIST:It seemed in the last scene as though Plato was looking to Jim and Judy to act as parents to him while at the same time Jim seemed determined to be there for Plato when he really needed a friend in exactly the same way he wanted his father [Jim Backus] to be there for him earlier that evening. In that context, the movie ended with a tone of hope for the families involved and through them perhaps for us all in a way, for perhaps hope is there if we at least keep trying.ABOUT THE DVD:This is the 2-DVD set.

328014,A16KRCLLTHSB5F,6302685141,Henry Platte,"[7, 8]","This exceptional movie probably deserves even more of a cult status than it already has. Most people, when they think of RWC, remember it only as one of the few examples we have of James Dean's eerie charisma; but it's also an entertaining and powerful film, well written and acted, and the credit for the lasting impression of Dean's character should go as much to the filmmakers as to Dean himself (not that Dean himself doesn't deserve bales and bales of credit).Today, a lot of elements of RWC might seem obvious; the generational gap in more apparent now than ever, and the attemps of children to compensate for a lack of parental attention has been a common theme for decades. Not only, though, should you consider that the film was groundbreaking when it was released, but what it has to _say_ about the issues between children and their parents is more relevant today than ever. The script deserves credit mainly for a couple of reasons:1) The film doesn't have that 'made by kids' feel that's afflicted a lot of more recent movies about kids, such as Better Luck Tomorrow. It has a definite sense of perspective, as in the scene where Jim's father tells him: 'I'm trying to show you how foolish you are!--Ten years from now, this won't mean anything; you'll look back on it and laugh!' In a way, he's right, but that doesn't make Jim's feelings or the problems facing him any less urgent at the moment.2) The kids in RWC are smart, and they have personalities beyond basic love-starved psychosis. Buzz, especially, is a surprisingly fully-drawn character, and some of Dean's best moments as Jim come when he's doing innocent things, like jumping up behind the fence to get Judy's attention. Finally, the scene in which Jim, Judy and Plato parody adult behavior is especially incisive and especially relevant today - kids are, in many ways, shrewder than they're given credit for, and their eyes are open.3) There are moments of overacting (Jim shouting: ""You're tearing me apart!""), but there's understatement too. At the beginning, for example, after Jim's father complains that he's bought everything for his son, and the audience is ready to write him off as ignorant and materialistic, he immediatley adds that he's shown Jim love and affection too - which may not be entirely true, but he's shown as being more than just a stock Bad Parent.4) Things like 'no stab' knife fights and racing with stolen cars might seem almost tame by modern standards, but the display of self-destructive behavior in RWC still has some emotional power. The kids may doing things which kids today would consider silly, but their attitudes are sometimes genuinely frightening. Again Buzz is a great character. The gang mentality, too, with its shifting attitudes and its effect on personality, is very striking and very accurate.In an era when parents seem to be trying harder than ever to understand their children, the problems have really remained the same. The consequences today might be more severe, but psychology and the human thrist for love are timeless, and RWC may well be timeless. In fact, beyond still being relevant, the film is an effective antidote to modern films which glorify and enshrine adolescent problems, when many of these things are just as pathetic, in the end, as a boy whose socks don't match.",5,Straight Talking,1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,3317,"['exceptional', 'movie', 'probably', 'even', 'more', 'cult', 'status', 'already', 'Most', 'people', 'when', 'think', 'RWC', 'remember', 'only', 'one', 'few', 'examples', 'have', 'James', 'Dean', 'eerie', 'charisma', 'also', 'entertaining', 'powerful', 'film', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'credit', 'lasting', 'impression', 'Dean', 'character', 'should', 'go', 'as', 'much', 'filmmakers', 'Dean', 'not', 'Dean', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'bales', 'bales', 'credit', '.Today', 'lot', 'elements', 'RWC', 'might', 'seem', 'obvious', 'generational', 'gap', 'more', 'apparent', 'now', 'ever', 'attemps', 'children', 'compensate', 'lack', 'parental', 'attention', 'been', 'common', 'theme', 'decades', 'Not', 'only', 'should', 'consider', 'film', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'what', '_say_', 'issues', 'children', 'parents', 'more', 'relevant', 'today', 'ever', 'script', 'credit', 'mainly', 'couple', 'reasons:1', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', ""'made"", 'kids', 'feel', 'afflicted', 'lot', 'more', 'recent', 'movies', 'kids', 'such', 'Better', 'Luck', 'Tomorrow', 'definite', 'sense', 'perspective', 'scene', 'where', 'Jim', 'father', ""'m"", 'trying', 'show', 'how', 'foolish', 'are', 'Ten', 'years', 'now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'look', 'back', 'laugh', 'way', 'right', ""n't"", 'make', 'Jim', 'feelings', 'problems', 'facing', 'less', 'urgent', 'moment.2', 'kids', 'RWC', 'are', 'smart', 'have', 'personalities', 'basic', 'love-starved', 'psychosis', 'Buzz', 'especially', 'surprisingly', 'fully-drawn', 'character', 'Dean', 'best', 'moments', 'Jim', 'come', 'when', 'doing', 'innocent', 'things', 'jumping', 'up', 'fence', 'get', 'Judy', 'attention', 'Finally', 'scene', 'Jim', 'Judy', 'Plato', 'parody', 'adult', 'behavior', 'especially', 'incisive', 'especially', 'relevant', 'today', 'kids', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'shrewder', ""'re"", 'given', 'credit', 'eyes', 'are', 'open.3', 'are', 'moments', 'overacting', 'Jim', 'shouting', ""'re"", 'tearing', 'apart', 'understatement', 'too', 'beginning', 'example', 'Jim', 'father', 'bought', 'everything', 'son', 'audience', 'ready', 'write', 'off', 'ignorant', 'materialistic', 'shown', 'Jim', 'love', 'affection', 'too', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'true', 'shown', 'being', 'more', 'just', 'stock', 'Bad', 'Parent.4', 'stab', 'knife', 'fights', 'racing', 'stolen', 'cars', 'might', 'seem', 'almost', 'tame', 'modern', 'standards', 'display', 'self-destructive', 'behavior', 'RWC', 'still', 'emotional', 'power', 'kids', 'may', 'doing', 'things', 'kids', 'today', 'would', 'consider', 'silly', 'attitudes', 'are', 'sometimes', 'genuinely', 'frightening', 'Again', 'Buzz', 'great', 'character', 'gang', 'mentality', 'too', 'shifting', 'attitudes', 'effect', 'personality', 'very', 'striking', 'very', 'accurate.In', 'era', 'when', 'parents', 'seem', 'be', 'trying', 'harder', 'ever', 'understand', 'children', 'problems', 'have', 'really', 'remained', 'same', 'consequences', 'today', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'severe', 'psychology', 'human', 'thrist', 'love', 'are', 'timeless', 'RWC', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'timeless', 'fact', 'still', 'being', 'relevant', 'film', 'effective', 'antidote', 'modern', 'films', 'glorify', 'enshrine', 'adolescent', 'problems', 'when', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'pathetic', 'end', 'boy', 'socks', 'do', ""n't"", 'match']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

I don't want to attack anyone who has reviewed the movie because, everyone is entitled to an opinion.But there is a review from someone in Illinois, that obviously did not pay attention to the movie. They comment on the fact that Judy does not grieve the loss of Buzz, Duh! Thats the point, the feeling of isolated youth and the confusion that youth brings. Judy has lost someone so close to her and yet she is not able to cry for him or even show any signs of loss, (Kinda deep huh?)This same reviewer pointed out that all the actors in the movie overact, What movie were you watching? With all the fake soap opera type acting we see in todays cinema the acting in Rebel seems low key given the circumstances.Another fact pointed out was the script and lack of quality it showed. Sorry, But I'm gonna have to disagree with you. The script was a combination of other ideas and I feel it has important structure and symbolism that is sometimes missed by the less intelligent viewer.As for the character played by Sal Mineo, we know from the opening scene that he is a powder keg. He blew away a bunch of helpless puppies because he was upset and distraught. He felt abandoned by Jim and Judy (Just like his mother and father!) and those same feelings made him feel like killing something or someone else. Totally believable.In closing I would suggest that The reviewer take another look at the movie, maybe three or four more looks. This movie is much deeper than a lousy script and some overacting actors.

328020,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6302685141,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[3, 3]","In this film James Dean is quite convincing as an actor and his part is perfect. A difficult part in that trinity of J, Jim (for James), Judy and John, in one letter Jesus three times and one of the three will have to be sacrificed, crucified in a way, falling right upon a random police bullet when unarmed.Just such a concentrate of the film shows how ridiculous the world was in 1955. The war was over and the horror of before, during and after was so bleak that the whole world was stoned into full paralytic dullness by the holocaust, the genocide, the fifty million victims and the huge destruction of goods and infrastructures but also of morals and ethics and plain human decency. No surprise that John had Plato as a middle name. The philosophy we could have then was nothing but the good thinking of an elite in a society where 80% of the people were slaves, like in Athens.In a world like that what is left for the young?The question is actually slightly premature in a way since these high school teenagers in the early 1950s had experienced the war. They had the horror of the end of that war and they had nothing to thrill them into believing there was some kind of future worth living. No allusion is done to it but there is nothing but the Cold War to enthuse these young people. With that kind of perspective there is not much any one can do to motivate them. We can even wonder if the world exists for these young people in this film.The parents are dead war heroes, or plain absent. They can also be neurotic and paranoid survivors who want to do things differently and well and do not see that either they run away from what these young people want, or they just ignore what they want, or they just leave them to their own means and to die playing some chicken dare over a cliff. The world is unable to provide these young people with the two things they want: love and a cause they could commit their lives to.And they will get none.The school system will go on harping on stars and constellations and will not see that some bullies are imposing their norms to everyone and that those these bullies decide to victimize will have to survive the death of their bullying challengers or die. What a beautiful perspective. Death in both cases. And they do nothing about it, the teachers and the guidance counsellors, and it is still going on. The pedagogical masters who are in fact monstrous monstrosities are just ignoring their very mission which is to build in all the young people they are entrusted with an idealistic vision of the future that makes them ready to work with everyone as equals and to respect everyone else in all their parameters and personalities. The school system has drastically been failing since 1945.The police is not better since they can only brandish weapons and shoot first. Nothing has changed there either since 1945. They do not wait for the presumed criminal to start shooting or to really prove he is dangerous for himself or for others. They neutralize him for life by inflicting him death first and wondering afterwards. In the particular case of this film the police officer who shot the boy did not get any order from his commanding officers, in fact it was the reverse, and he was under no menace from an unloaded gun and the other young man had actually said so but it must have gotten lost in translation from plain English to police speak.Young people want to invest their tremendous energy in some cause, but they have none worth even blinking half an eye. Young people want to love everyone and find love in everyone, and not that kind of churchlike love but all the shades of love you can imagine, fatherly, motherly, friendly, brotherly, sisterly and even plain childlike and adult love. That's a lot and I can tell you that has not change since Auschwitz: love is the last thing anyone will provide the people around them on a daily basis, and if anyone tried to do that he or she would at once be classified perverse, paedophilic, peevish, petulant, in one word depraved, though in fact that someone is only trying to give what they want and need to deprived people.But deprivation is the basic goods of this society.Is there any hope? For the dead chap certainly not though he is going with the coat of one who was his friend and he knew it more or less. For the young man who gave his coat he found a girl friend but will that be enough of a cause to satisfy his rebellious needs? He also finally found some understanding on the side of his father and especially of his mother. Will she be able to remain that open or will she go back to her frigid paranoia and escapism? For the girl Judy she lost a boyfriend down the cliff who was a bully and she got a new one who was the bully's plaything. Did she win anything? And how long will she be able to go on with her subservient attitude: waiting for and finding the man she wants to submit to?Without a cause and without a commitment to that cause, there is no hope on this earth and in this society. You should read the exchanges of young people on Facebook reacting at the French presidential election to understand nothing has changed. They want to commit themselves to a cause but politicians only propose them obedience to some authority, left, right or whatever, but never the reverse: let's hear from you and what you would like to commit yourself to in order to serve your society and other people, not only satisfy your personal and selfish interests.A film that still speaks to us even if it has aged technically.Dr Jacques

It was one of the first films to deal with alienated youth, and although elements of it are dated and very much a part of Fifties culture, it still maintains its power and appeal.  Of course, a great deal of that power and appeal comes from Dean's most famous and defining performance.  He brings so much raw energy and emotion to his character, and he has a screen presence that is so unique you can understand why he continues to be such a larger than life figure in film, even with only three starring roles to his credit.

The film cannot be watched as anything but a stage for Dean's method acting (revolutionary and progressive in its own right in the mid 1950s).

He was, purely and simply, a natural.  And in his second movie, ""Rebel Without a Cause"", he showed clearly what he had hinted at in ""East Of Eden"", a stroke of genius.  ""Rebel"" is the great picture it is mainly because Dean is in it.  Dean doesn't play Jim Stark, he IS Jim Stark.  He brings to vivid reality all the confusion and anguish of a 17 year old who doesn't know who he is or where he's headed; we see his love for both his parents struggling with his resentment against his overbearing mother and his contempt for his henpecked father; and his bewilderment at participating in the ""chicken run"" even while he accepts its inevitability (""Why are we doing this?"" he asks Buzz, the delinquent gang leader played by Corey Allen; ""I dunno; we gotta do something"", Buzz answers, as confused and fatalistic as Jim).  In that exchange lies the film in a nutshell.  Why do these kids indulge in anti-social behavior that risks their lives?  Because there's nothing else in their lives that has any real meaning.  In these youngsters we see all the vapid emptiness of 1950's suburbia.  This is what made this 1955 movie so compelling, and so disturbing, to its audience when it opened -- these weren't aliens from the slums of the big cities; these were the kids next door.""Rebel"" is also the movie that made household names of Dean's two co-stars, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo.  Wood plays Judy, a vibrant, popular teenager living with her uptight parents and her younger brother.  Judy's father is distant and withdrawn from her; and the more Judy, who loves her father more than anything in the world, reaches out to him, the more he repulses her.  What Judy can't understand, but what we can see, is that her growing sexuality is profoundly disturbing to her father; he's attracted and repelled at the same time, and he reacts by pushing her away.  Judy reacts to his rejection by running away and staying out all night, which alienates him further.  At least Judy has parents at home.  Plato, brilliantly acted by Sal Mineo, has nobody but the housekeeper.  His parents are off in Europe somewhere; they can't be bothered with him, and when Plato finally receives a long-awaited envelope from his father, he eagerly tears it open only to find a check enclosed, without a word of ""hi"" or ""how are you"".  Plato is far more lost than Jim or Judy, and at the movie's conclusion, we realize that the denouement was inevitable.  Almost too late, Jim's parents begin to understand their son; whether or not Judy and her father will reach a similar rapprochement is unknown...",5,James Dean... as himself,1017014400,"03 25, 2002",2002,2692,"['phenom', 'James', 'Dean', 'along', 'once', 'generation', 'will', 'be', 'fortunate', 'see', 'like', 'again', 'lifetime', 'was', 'purely', 'simply', 'natural', 'second', 'movie', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'showed', 'clearly', 'what', 'had', 'hinted', 'East', 'Eden', 'stroke', 'genius', 'Rebel', 'great', 'picture', 'mainly', 'Dean', 'Dean', ""n't"", 'play', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'vivid', 'reality', 'confusion', 'anguish', '17', 'year', 'old', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'where', 'headed', 'see', 'love', 'parents', 'struggling', 'resentment', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'contempt', 'henpecked', 'father', 'bewilderment', 'participating', 'chicken', 'run', 'even', 'inevitability', 'Why', 'are', 'doing', 'Buzz', 'delinquent', 'gang', 'leader', 'played', 'Corey', 'Allen', 'dunno', 'got', 'ta', 'do', 'something', 'Buzz', 'answers', 'confused', 'fatalistic', 'Jim', 'exchange', 'film', 'nutshell', 'Why', 'do', 'kids', 'indulge', 'anti-social', 'behavior', 'lives', 'nothing', 'else', 'lives', 'real', 'meaning', 'youngsters', 'see', 'vapid', 'emptiness', '1950', 'suburbia', 'what', 'made', '1955', 'movie', 'so', 'compelling', 'so', 'disturbing', 'audience', 'when', 'opened', 'were', ""n't"", 'aliens', 'slums', 'big', 'cities', 'were', 'kids', 'door', 'Rebel', 'also', 'movie', 'made', 'household', 'names', 'Dean', 'two', 'co-stars', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'Wood', 'Judy', 'vibrant', 'popular', 'teenager', 'living', 'uptight', 'parents', 'younger', 'brother', 'Judy', 'father', 'distant', 'withdrawn', 'more', 'Judy', 'who', 'father', 'more', 'anything', 'world', 'out', 'more', 'What', 'Judy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'growing', 'sexuality', 'profoundly', 'disturbing', 'father', 'attracted', 'repelled', 'same', 'time', 'pushing', 'away', 'Judy', 'rejection', 'running', 'away', 'staying', 'out', 'night', 'further', 'least', 'Judy', 'parents', 'home', 'Plato', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'nobody', 'housekeeper', 'parents', 'are', 'Europe', 'somewhere', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'when', 'Plato', 'finally', 'long-awaited', 'envelope', 'father', 'eagerly', 'open', 'only', 'find', 'check', 'enclosed', 'word', 'hi', 'how', 'are', 'Plato', 'far', 'more', 'lost', 'Jim', 'Judy', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'realize', 'denouement', 'was', 'inevitable', 'Almost', 'too', 'late', 'Jim', 'parents', 'begin', 'understand', 'son', 'not', 'Judy', 'father', 'will', 'reach', 'similar', 'rapprochement', 'unknown']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

""Rebel without a cause"" is still a timeless masterpiece. Kids of today can still relate to it's basic premise, of youth misunderstood.. .of wanting to belong.. The clothes, hair, and times may have changed, but the story of 3 teens, bonding as the world around them seems to cave-in, is just as potent today as it was in 1955. James Dean delivers a knock-out performance, as Jim Stark.It's his first day at a new high school. Only, this time, he wants to do things the right way: A troubled past, his parents avoid problems by simply moving. On this day, Jim truly wants things to be different for good. The night before wasn't great!. Arrested for public intoxication, his parents, perhaps the first glimpse of a ""dysfunctional"" family on screen, hardly know how to handle the situation: Mom is overbearing, self-centered and constantly ruling over anything his father has to say. His dad is a lilly-livered man with good intentions, but Jim needs guidance. He begs for it, in his rebellion. At the police station, among the other teens in trouble, isJudy (played by the gorgeous, Natalie Wood). Judy has similar problems with her parents. Her father actually slapped her for kissing him on the cheek! All Judy wants is to feel loved. Also at the jail, is John ""Plato"", played to perfection by Sal Mineo (Nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor). When we first meet Plato, he is being questioned why he shot a bunch of puppies, a horrifying way to introduce a character, but somehow, Mineo makes us care about Plato, a rich kid with tons of problems: His dad disappeared, and his mom is always away on trips, leaving him to be cared for by the family maid. Plato is looking for somebody to be his friend, or family. And by the end of 24 hours, these 3 will make their own tightly knit little circle.After a rough start in school, Jim finds trouble during a field trip at ""Griffith Park Observatory"" with a bunch of rough kids, including Judy, who runs with the wrong crowd. Jim meets Plato at the Observatory, who warns him not to ""monkey with"" them. But, the kids are dead-set on causing Jim trouble, and before we know it, Buzz, the leader of the gang, forces Jim into a knife-fight.. Jim, Judy, and Plato form a kind of ""family"",(and it's obvious Plato has a crush on Jimmy,possiby the first gay teen in cinema history) and end up hiding out at a deserted mansion near the Observatory, as the gang searches for them, as well as the police. In Jim, Judy finds a young man who she can truly love...And Plato finds a buddy he always has wished for.. ..The performances are so gut wrenching, and real, you cannot help but feel their pain.. .When Plato screams out, ""save me"" holding a gun, as the gang closes in, you cannot help but feel his pain. These 3 not only make you care for them, but you can almost ""feel"" their agony. ""Rebel"" is not just the tale of teens trying to fit-in. It is also about friendship.. it's about loyalty.. integrity, and the basic need to feel loved. That is what makes this movie so potent. That is why generation after generation have discovered, and embraced ""Rebel"". Times have changed, but human emotions haven't: We all long for human interaction, and companionship. And for 24 hours, at least, this family of 3 found it. We should all be so lucky.",5,"Sal Mineo, James Dean, Natalie Wood, in a masterpiece",1076112000,"02 7, 2004",2004,3395,"['What', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'classics', 'ever', 'made', 'PLENTY', 'Rebel', 'cause', 'still', 'timeless', 'masterpiece', 'Kids', 'today', 'can', 'still', 'relate', 'basic', 'premise', 'youth', 'misunderstood..', '.of', 'wanting', 'belong..', 'clothes', 'hair', 'times', 'may', 'have', 'changed', 'story', '3', 'teens', 'bonding', 'world', 'cave-in', 'just', 'potent', 'today', 'was', '1955', 'James', 'Dean', 'knock-out', 'performance', 'Jim', 'Stark.It', 'first', 'day', 'new', 'high', 'school', 'Only', 'time', 'do', 'things', 'right', 'way', 'troubled', 'past', 'parents', 'avoid', 'problems', 'simply', 'moving', 'day', 'Jim', 'truly', 'things', 'be', 'different', 'good', 'night', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'Arrested', 'public', 'intoxication', 'parents', 'perhaps', 'first', 'glimpse', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'screen', 'hardly', 'know', 'how', 'handle', 'situation', 'Mom', 'overbearing', 'self-centered', 'constantly', 'ruling', 'over', 'anything', 'father', 'say', 'dad', 'lilly-livered', 'man', 'good', 'intentions', 'Jim', 'guidance', 'rebellion', 'police', 'station', 'other', 'teens', 'trouble', 'isJudy', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Judy', 'similar', 'problems', 'parents', 'father', 'actually', 'slapped', 'kissing', 'cheek', 'Judy', 'feel', 'loved', 'Also', 'jail', 'John', 'Plato', 'played', 'perfection', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'Nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Plato', 'being', 'questioned', 'why', 'shot', 'bunch', 'puppies', 'horrifying', 'way', 'introduce', 'character', 'somehow', 'Mineo', 'care', 'Plato', 'rich', 'kid', 'tons', 'problems', 'dad', 'disappeared', 'mom', 'always', 'away', 'trips', 'leaving', 'be', 'cared', 'family', 'maid', 'Plato', 'looking', 'somebody', 'be', 'friend', 'family', 'end', '24', 'hours', '3', 'will', 'make', 'own', 'tightly', 'knit', 'little', 'circle.After', 'rough', 'start', 'school', 'Jim', 'trouble', 'field', 'trip', 'Griffith', 'Park', 'Observatory', 'bunch', 'rough', 'kids', 'including', 'Judy', 'who', 'wrong', 'crowd', 'Jim', 'Plato', 'Observatory', 'who', 'not', 'monkey', 'kids', 'are', 'dead-set', 'causing', 'Jim', 'trouble', 'know', 'Buzz', 'leader', 'gang', 'forces', 'Jim', 'knife-fight..', 'Jim', 'Judy', 'Plato', 'form', 'kind', 'family', 'obvious', 'Plato', 'crush', 'Jimmy', 'possiby', 'first', 'gay', 'teen', 'cinema', 'history', 'end', 'up', 'hiding', 'out', 'deserted', 'mansion', 'Observatory', 'gang', 'searches', 'as', 'well', 'police', 'Jim', 'Judy', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'truly', 'love', 'Plato', 'buddy', 'always', 'wished', 'for..', '..The', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'real', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'pain..', '.When', 'Plato', 'out', 'save', 'holding', 'gun', 'gang', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'pain', '3', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'care', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'agony', 'Rebel', 'not', 'just', 'tale', 'teens', 'trying', 'fit-in', 'also', 'about', 'loyalty..', 'integrity', 'basic', 'need', 'feel', 'loved', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'potent', 'why', 'generation', 'generation', 'have', 'discovered', 'embraced', 'Rebel', 'Times', 'have', 'changed', 'human', 'emotions', 'have', ""n't"", 'long', 'human', 'interaction', 'companionship', '24', 'hours', 'least', 'family', '3', 'found', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'lucky']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

If you ignore the style and words that the characters use, kids are still like this today. #59 on The American Film Institute's Top 100 List the film stars Dean as Jim Stark. When we meet Jim, he is stumbling drunkenly through the streets. He's arrested and at the police station we meet the other two major players Plato (Sal Mineo) and Judy (Natalie Wood). Plato, nowadays, would be a likely candidate for a school shooter. In the police station, we learn that he was arrested for shooting puppies. He's a lonely kid, with no parents and no friends. Judy is a typical-High schoolgirl, who hangs out with the local gang and has Daddy-issues. Jim, himself, is the new kid in town trying to find a place to belong. His parents are constantly fighting (in one famous scene early on he reveals ""You're tearing me apart!"") and constantly moving him around. While on a field trip to the Planetarium (an odd thing to do on the first day of school), he finds himself in a knife fight with the head of the local gang, Buzz. Jim wins, but is challenged to a game later that night that involves two people driving a car towards the edge of a cliff and whoever jumps out first is a ""chicken."" The movie, miraculously, takes place over the course of a day...Odd, since it has enough events to fill at least a month of time. This is the first film I've seen with James Dean and this is a terrific performance, making it not hard to see why he has remained a screen-icon all these years. Many people will recognize while watching the film that it still works to this day. Kids don't dress like this or call each other ""chicken"" anymore (unless they're in Kindergarten); Knife fights aren't ""in"" but it still manages to capture the feelings and problems one has in adolescence. It's one of the few ""classic"" movies that modern-day kids will be able to enjoy as well as their parents.GRADE: A",5,Rebel Without a Cause,1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,1982,"['Rebel', 'Cause', 'film', 'made', 'James', 'Dean', 'star', 'film', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'ignore', 'style', 'words', 'characters', 'use', 'kids', 'are', 'still', 'today', '59', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', 'Top', '100', 'List', 'film', 'stars', 'Dean', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'When', 'meet', 'Jim', 'stumbling', 'drunkenly', 'streets', 'arrested', 'police', 'station', 'meet', 'other', 'two', 'major', 'players', 'Plato', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'Judy', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Plato', 'nowadays', 'would', 'be', 'likely', 'candidate', 'school', 'shooter', 'police', 'station', 'learn', 'was', 'arrested', 'shooting', 'puppies', 'lonely', 'kid', 'parents', 'friends', 'Judy', 'typical-High', 'schoolgirl', 'who', 'out', 'local', 'gang', 'Daddy-issues', 'Jim', 'new', 'kid', 'town', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'belong', 'parents', 'are', 'constantly', 'fighting', 'one', 'famous', 'scene', 'early', ""'re"", 'tearing', 'apart', 'constantly', 'moving', 'around', 'field', 'trip', 'Planetarium', 'odd', 'thing', 'do', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'knife', 'fight', 'head', 'local', 'gang', 'Buzz', 'Jim', 'challenged', 'game', 'later', 'night', 'two', 'people', 'driving', 'car', 'edge', 'cliff', 'whoever', 'jumps', 'out', 'first', 'chicken', 'movie', 'miraculously', 'place', 'course', 'day', 'Odd', 'enough', 'events', 'fill', 'least', 'month', 'time', 'first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'James', 'Dean', 'terrific', 'performance', 'making', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'remained', 'screen-icon', 'years', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'recognize', 'watching', 'film', 'still', 'day', 'Kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'dress', 'call', 'other', 'chicken', 'anymore', ""'re"", 'Kindergarten', 'Knife', 'fights', 'are', ""n't"", 'still', 'capture', 'feelings', 'problems', 'one', 'adolescence', 'one', 'few', 'classic', 'movies', 'modern-day', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'parents.GRADE']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

I went to IMDB and discovered that Jim kisses Plato in one scene, but the censors had it taken out. I really wish they would have kept it.

Still, there are parallels. You have the teenagers, who are troubled and mostly nice but misunderstood. (Even the bad guy in _Rebel_ is this way.) You have the Fifties, which were also mostly nice, but misunderstood. Aside from these things, though, _The Blob_ had&#8230; a blob! Yeah yeah. I know, it&#8217;s a gimmick.

Stewart Stern's coy script may seem a little dated now, but the drama is still potent enough to resonate with modern audiences, and there's a wealth of surprising subtexts, including Natalie Wood's impressive turn as an immature teenager who feels rejected by her father (William Hopper) because he refuses to indulge the kind of affections he lavished on her as a child, and Sal Mineo as the brittle interloper who keeps a picture of Alan Ladd in his school locker and develops an obvious crush on the dazzling new boy, played by Dean. A formidable young talent, Dean's signature red jacket affords him a visual prominence denied most of his fellow actors, and he judges the emotional honesty of each sequence with uncanny precision.Director Ray uses the CinemaScope frame in a wholly expressive manner, dividing his characters across the length and breadth of the wide screen and tilting the image at crucial dramatic moments. However, despite powerful performances by a strong supporting cast (including Jim Backus, Ann Doran, Edward Platt and Dennis Hopper), a 'daring' screenplay and A-list production values, the film's many virtues have been slightly overshadowed by Dean's tragic early death and subsequent iconic status within American culture.",4,"Landmark 'teen' movie, as potent as ever...",1062633600,"09 4, 2003",2003,1845,"['REBEL', 'WITHOUT', 'A', 'CAUSE', 'USA', '1955', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '2.55:1', 'CinemaScope', 'Theatrical', 'soundtrack', '4-track', 'stereoA', 'troubled', 'teenager', 'James', 'Dean', 'find', 'place', 'new', 'school', 'where', 'love', 'fellow', 'student', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'forced', 'confrontation', 'bullying', 'boyfriend', 'Corey', 'Allen', 'leading', 'unexpected', 'tragedy', 'Nicholas', 'Ray', 'quintessential', 'Fifties', 'melodrama', 'signalled', 'sea-change', 'American', 'cinema', 'saw', 'glossy', 'fantasies', 'made', 'popular', 'wartime', 'gradually', 'replaced', 'tougher', 'subjects', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'contemporary', 'society', 'Stewart', 'Stern', 'coy', 'script', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'dated', 'now', 'drama', 'still', 'potent', 'enough', 'resonate', 'modern', 'audiences', 'wealth', 'surprising', 'subtexts', 'including', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'impressive', 'turn', 'immature', 'teenager', 'who', 'rejected', 'father', 'William', 'Hopper', 'indulge', 'kind', 'affections', 'lavished', 'child', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'brittle', 'interloper', 'who', 'picture', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'school', 'locker', 'obvious', 'crush', 'dazzling', 'new', 'boy', 'played', 'Dean', 'A', 'formidable', 'young', 'talent', 'Dean', 'signature', 'red', 'jacket', 'affords', 'visual', 'prominence', 'denied', 'most', 'fellow', 'actors', 'judges', 'emotional', 'honesty', 'sequence', 'uncanny', 'precision.Director', 'Ray', 'CinemaScope', 'frame', 'wholly', 'expressive', 'manner', 'dividing', 'characters', 'length', 'breadth', 'wide', 'screen', 'tilting', 'image', 'crucial', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'However', 'powerful', 'performances', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'Ann', 'Doran', 'Edward', 'Platt', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', ""'daring"", 'screenplay', 'A-list', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'many', 'virtues', 'have', 'been', 'slightly', 'overshadowed', 'Dean', 'tragic', 'early', 'death', 'subsequent', 'iconic', 'status', 'American', 'culture']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

We are surrounded by TV shows, novels, movies, and other systems that all view the world through teenage eyes. But back in the 1940s and 1950s, that wasn't the case. Movies were about adults and how adults handled things. Rebel Without a Cause became an instant classic because finally there was a movie from a teen's point of view. It showed the issues and challenges that teens were facing in a world recovering from World War II.Undoubtedly parents of the time thought teens had it easy. After all, the war was over. All the hardships and rationing and trauma involved with the war was a thing of the past. ""You kids never had it so good"". They had nice clothes and a life free from being sent to war. But to the teens of the time, they had a new set of challenges.Mineo grows up with everything money can buy - but not the affection of his parents. They aren't even at home - they've left him behind with a caretaker. Wood craves her father's love and affection - but he apparently has become distant as she became more womanly. He's uncomfortable hugging her.And then there's Dean. His parents seem wealthy, and seem to care for him. But they argue about him constantly. Also, the movie makes quite a big deal about how ""masculine"" the mom is, vs how ""feminine"" the father is. One of Dean's plaintive cries is that he wants his father to stand up for him - but the father just looks away.It can be tempting to dismiss the issues these kids face. So many modern movies tackle teens who grapple with being abused, who are sucked into gang life, and many other quite painful situations. Still, it's important to look at this as a starting point. At least we get to see what the teens' challenges are. And from there we could then delve into even more serious problems as the years move forward.It's also, of course, a view into a specific period in time. The men are doing all the action and talking. The girls are just there as arm-candy. Wood is the only woman in the film with any real lines. The mom and grandmom are simply there to show the ""problems of a too-strong woman"". Even the female teacher is ineffective.But apparently, in the end, Wood is necessary. The only time in the entire movie that Dean's mother and father agree is when they see Dean with Wood on his arm. They both smile contentedly to each other, as if to say ""OK everything will be fine now, he has a girl"".It's poignant that the three main stars of this movie - Dean, Wood, and Mineo - all died tragically at a young age. Maybe it does show how even those we feel might ""have it made"" face challenges that are not necessarily obvious. It shows we should have sympathy for everyone around us, no matter what their status in life.

East of Eden tells the story of a boy named Cal Trask and his attempts to win the love of his father Adam Trask.  Adam prefers his other son Aaron, the ""good"" son over Cal the ""bad"" son.  The names Cal and Aaron obviously bring to mind Cain and Abel from the Bible.  Adding  to the emotional fireworks, Cal finds himself increasingly attracted to Aaron's fiancee Abra.  Cal's attempts to win the love and approval of everyone around him are frustrated at every turn as everyone considers him bad.  The film is set in Salinas, California in 1917 as America is about to enter the First World War.Kazan grew up in the company of a disapproving father who never missed the opportunity to remind him that he preferred his siblings.  His nickname for Kazan: Good-for-nothing.  Later in Hollywood, Kazan would famously cooperate with HUAC in their horrific witch hunt.  This earned him the disapproval and outrage of many other filmmakers who never forgave Kazan for his appalling acts.Thus it was not a coincidence that East of Eden was made in the years following Kazan's HUAC testimony.  Nor is it a coincidence that Kazan chose to focus on the Cain character when he adapted John Steinbeck's enormous novel.  Kazan made a moving and poetic film about an ostrasized and misunderstood young man struggling against what he believes to be his innate nature.The neurotic James Dean (in his first starring role), was ideally cast as Kazan's alter ego.  The film's lush colour photography and beautiful Leonard Rosenman score add to the emotional charge.When is this film coming out on DVD?",5,Kazan as Cain,1022371200,"05 26, 2002",2002,1765,"['Many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'when', 'are', 'watching', 'film', 'Waterfront', 'are', 'watching', 'semi-autobiographical', 'story', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan.Allow', 'explain', 'East', 'Eden', 'story', 'boy', 'named', 'Cal', 'Trask', 'attempts', 'win', 'love', 'father', 'Adam', 'Trask', 'Adam', 'prefers', 'other', 'son', 'Aaron', 'good', 'son', 'Cal', 'bad', 'son', 'names', 'Cal', 'Aaron', 'obviously', 'bring', 'mind', 'Cain', 'Abel', 'Bible', 'Adding', 'emotional', 'fireworks', 'Cal', 'increasingly', 'attracted', 'Aaron', 'fiancee', 'Abra', 'Cal', 'attempts', 'win', 'love', 'approval', 'everyone', 'are', 'frustrated', 'turn', 'everyone', 'bad', 'film', 'set', 'Salinas', 'California', '1917', 'America', 'enter', 'First', 'World', 'War.Kazan', 'grew', 'up', 'company', 'disapproving', 'father', 'who', 'never', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'remind', 'preferred', 'siblings', 'nickname', 'Kazan', 'Good-for-nothing', 'Later', 'Hollywood', 'Kazan', 'would', 'famously', 'cooperate', 'HUAC', 'horrific', 'witch', 'hunt', 'earned', 'disapproval', 'outrage', 'many', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'never', 'forgave', 'Kazan', 'appalling', 'was', 'not', 'coincidence', 'East', 'Eden', 'was', 'made', 'years', 'following', 'Kazan', 'HUAC', 'testimony', 'coincidence', 'Kazan', 'chose', 'focus', 'Cain', 'character', 'when', 'adapted', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'enormous', 'novel', 'Kazan', 'made', 'moving', 'poetic', 'film', 'ostrasized', 'misunderstood', 'young', 'man', 'struggling', 'what', 'be', 'innate', 'nature.The', 'neurotic', 'James', 'Dean', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'was', 'ideally', 'cast', 'Kazan', 'alter', 'ego', 'film', 'lush', 'colour', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'Leonard', 'Rosenman', 'score', 'add', 'emotional', 'charge.When', 'film', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

In my mind, you can't quite label him an anti-hero in this movie.  You  have to show his character respect. In my mind, what makes this film great  is what you might find fault with in other films.  At times it seems overly  melodramatic and so emotional it seems painful to watch.  But this ain't no  &quot;Titanic.&quot;  Somehow, all this intense emotion is what gives the  film its power.

328065,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6302685141,Robert Morris,"[40, 45]","Released soon after James Dean's death, in the same year in which East of Eden also appeared, this film immediately attracted and rewarded great interest and has continued to do so. Part of its appeal is explained by the fact that Dean died instantaneously in a violent car crash, Natalie Wood drowned, Sal Mineo was stabbed to death, and Nick Adams overdosed on prescription drugs. Their premature deaths enrich even more the poignancy of their roles as teenage rebels ""without a cause."" Actually, much of their behavior is explained by their unhappiness in their dysfunctional families. Jim Stark (Dean) feels smothered by his parents who move from one town to another, hoping that he will finally ""find himself."" Judy Hopper (Wood) desperately needs love from a father (William Hopper) who is unwilling and/or unable to provide it. Plato (Mineo) seems to have no contact whatsoever with his parents. Meanwhile, Judy eagerly agrees to be gang leader Buzz Gunderson's ""trophy girlfriend."" After his death, she shifts her attention to Jim. They and Plato briefly become a ""family of three,"" in one scene in an abandoned mansion even pretending (albeit satirically) to be father, mother, and son. (FYI, the set in which this scene was shot is alleged to have appeared earlier in Sunset Boulevard as Norma Desmond's mansion.) All of the film's action occurs within a 24-hour time period, beginning in a police station and ending with police also involved because....Nicholas Ray directed Rebel Without a Cause and also co-authored the script. Working with an exceptionally talented cast, he succeeded so well with evoking great performances from that cast that Dean, Wood, and Mineo have since become icons for teenage malaise. They brood, they pout, they withdraw, they whine, they whimper, while feeling totally misunderstood by adults. They especially resent their parents' inability to ""get it"" even without knowing what that ""it"" is.I saw this film again recently, again impressed by the quality of the acting but, probably inevitably, much of the film now seems dated to me even as it retains much of its innocence. Some scenes remain quite vivid, such as when Judy stands proudly out in the field, bathed in automobile headlights, before ""officially"" starting the ""Chickie Run"" contest; also when Jim urges his Mitty-like father (Jim Backus) to stand up to his (Mr. Stark's) badger-like wife (Ann Doran).

328066,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,6302685141,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[2, 2]","Jim Stark (James Dean) is a lonely desperate teenager, who supposedly hasn't a friend in the world when we first see him lying drunk in an L.A gutter... But his personality is such that within a twenty-four-hour period he makes friends with Plato (Sal Mineo) and Judy (Natalie Wood), two misunderstood teenagers completely different from each other and himself...Every tempestuous young boy who considers himself friendless, confused, and aimless, can easily identify with Jim... For the youth of the middle 1950's, Dean's screen image was a symbol of loneliness, anger, and frustration...Jim's appealing characteristics are his sincerity, his warmth toward Judy, his concern for his friend Plato (whom no one else likes) his protectiveness, his shyness, his bravery, his good looks, his tender way of kissing, and his desperate need to be loved...Jim is a troubled new student in a high school in Los Angeles, who is not only willing to reveal that he loves his father, but also has the capacity to cry - which he does often... His one bad characteristic is his violent nature, but at least his fury is not directed at Judy or his friend Plato... He meets these two in jail, where he has been taken on a drunk and disorderly charge...Jim and Julie have an immediate connection, and Plato warns them against Julie's boyfriend, Buzz... Buzz and his gang slash the tires of Jim's cars and a fight ensues... The boys decide to settle their differences by having a 'chicken run.' Each will drive a stolen car toward the brink of a cliff, and the first to jump before the automobile lunges over will be a coward...In the 1950s, the two basic ways that youth could rebel seemed to be through acts of violence and delinquency and through gathering into groups and being directed by a group leader... Richard Brooks' ""Blackboard Jungle"" vividly described that situation...As teenagers we liked being called 'rebels.' At that age we weren't out to destroy the 'system,' but like Jim we wanted the 'system' to become more sensitive to our needs, to apologize for being careless, and to make us part of the existing order...At that age we recognized Jim's failure to communicate with his parents, and the way he mumbled when he thought no one was listening and started his sentences over, louder and clearer... He was our ideal... Everything he said was so right, so clever, so cool...When the unfriendly Judy calls him a YoYo and runs off to join her friends, he says softly, ""I love you, too."" When the now friendly Judy asks him why he kissed her on the forehead, he says simply: ""I felt like it."" When Buzz asks him if he knows what a ""chickie run"" is, he fibs, ""That's all I ever do."" When Plato asks him if he can keep his jacket, Jim exclaims, ""Well, what do you think?""At that age Nicholas Ray's teenagers were hopelessly confused, seeking advice and getting no answers... Their confusion was symbolized by Plato's mismatched socks... Jim, Judy, and Plato pretend to be a family unit based on a mutual trust and understanding, the only structure which can combat the cosmic emptiness of 'man alone.''Rebel Without a Cause' is the first film to suggest that juvenile violence is not necessarily bred in the poor neighborhoods... It is the disenchanted cry of youth, neglected by their parents, and alienated from the adult world...Judy sobs that her father stops kissing her when she was sixteen, and causes her pain when he labels her a 'dirty tramp.' Plato is lost and in despair because his absent, divorced parents have left him completely in the care of a black housekeeper... During questioning, he asserts: ""Nobody can help me.""In watching 'Rebel Without a Cause,' we can see the desperate father-son relationship, the need to be loved and understood as an individual... That is why 'Rebel Without a Cause' is the best of the alienated-youth films of the period, and the most emotional of films...Dean's death in an automobile accident in 1955 was a crippling blow to one of the most characteristic elements of fifties cinema...",5,The most emotional of films...,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,4031,"['Jim', 'Stark', 'James', 'Dean', 'lonely', 'desperate', 'teenager', 'who', 'supposedly', ""n't"", 'friend', 'world', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'lying', 'drunk', 'L.A', 'gutter', 'personality', 'such', 'twenty-four-hour', 'period', 'friends', 'Plato', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'Judy', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'two', 'misunderstood', 'teenagers', 'completely', 'different', 'other', 'Every', 'tempestuous', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'friendless', 'confused', 'aimless', 'can', 'easily', 'identify', 'Jim', 'youth', 'middle', '1950', 'Dean', 'screen', 'image', 'was', 'symbol', 'loneliness', 'anger', 'frustration', 'Jim', 'appealing', 'characteristics', 'are', 'sincerity', 'warmth', 'Judy', 'concern', 'friend', 'Plato', 'whom', 'one', 'else', 'protectiveness', 'shyness', 'bravery', 'good', 'looks', 'tender', 'way', 'kissing', 'desperate', 'need', 'be', 'loved', 'Jim', 'troubled', 'new', 'student', 'high', 'school', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'willing', 'reveal', 'father', 'also', 'capacity', 'cry', 'often', 'one', 'bad', 'characteristic', 'violent', 'nature', 'least', 'fury', 'not', 'directed', 'Judy', 'friend', 'Plato', 'two', 'jail', 'where', 'been', 'taken', 'drunk', 'disorderly', 'charge', 'Jim', 'Julie', 'have', 'immediate', 'connection', 'Plato', 'Julie', 'boyfriend', 'Buzz', 'Buzz', 'gang', 'slash', 'tires', 'Jim', 'cars', 'fight', 'ensues', 'boys', 'decide', 'settle', 'differences', 'having', ""'chicken"", 'run', 'will', 'drive', 'stolen', 'car', 'brink', 'cliff', 'first', 'jump', 'automobile', 'over', 'will', 'be', 'coward', '1950s', 'two', 'basic', 'ways', 'youth', 'could', 'rebel', 'seemed', 'be', 'acts', 'violence', 'delinquency', 'gathering', 'groups', 'being', 'directed', 'group', 'leader', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', 'vividly', 'described', 'situation', 'teenagers', 'liked', 'being', 'called', ""'rebels"", 'age', 'were', ""n't"", 'out', 'destroy', ""'system"", 'Jim', 'wanted', ""'system"", 'become', 'more', 'sensitive', 'needs', 'apologize', 'being', 'careless', 'make', 'part', 'existing', 'order', 'age', 'recognized', 'Jim', 'failure', 'communicate', 'parents', 'way', 'mumbled', 'when', 'thought', 'one', 'was', 'listening', 'started', 'sentences', 'louder', 'clearer', 'was', 'ideal', 'Everything', 'said', 'was', 'so', 'right', 'so', 'clever', 'so', 'cool', 'When', 'unfriendly', 'Judy', 'YoYo', 'join', 'friends', 'softly', 'love', 'too', 'When', 'now', 'friendly', 'Judy', 'why', 'kissed', 'forehead', 'simply', 'felt', 'When', 'Buzz', 'what', 'chickie', 'run', 'ever', 'do', 'When', 'Plato', 'can', 'keep', 'jacket', 'Jim', 'Well', 'what', 'do', 'think', 'age', 'Nicholas', 'Ray', 'teenagers', 'were', 'hopelessly', 'confused', 'seeking', 'advice', 'getting', 'answers', 'confusion', 'was', 'symbolized', 'Plato', 'mismatched', 'socks', 'Jim', 'Judy', 'Plato', 'pretend', 'be', 'family', 'unit', 'based', 'mutual', 'trust', 'understanding', 'only', 'structure', 'can', 'combat', 'cosmic', 'emptiness', ""'man"", 'alone', ""''Rebel"", 'Cause', 'first', 'film', 'suggest', 'juvenile', 'violence', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bred', 'poor', 'neighborhoods', 'disenchanted', 'cry', 'youth', 'neglected', 'parents', 'alienated', 'adult', 'world', 'Judy', 'sobs', 'father', 'stops', 'kissing', 'when', 'was', 'sixteen', 'pain', 'when', ""'dirty"", 'tramp', 'Plato', 'lost', 'despair', 'absent', 'divorced', 'parents', 'have', 'left', 'completely', 'care', 'black', 'housekeeper', 'questioning', 'Nobody', 'can', 'help', 'watching', ""'Rebel"", 'Cause', 'can', 'see', 'desperate', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'need', 'be', 'loved', 'understood', 'individual', 'why', 'Cause', 'best', 'alienated-youth', 'films', 'period', 'most', 'emotional', 'films', 'Dean', 'death', 'automobile', 'accident', '1955', 'was', 'crippling', 'blow', 'one', 'most', 'characteristic', 'elements', 'fifties', 'cinema']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

James Dean stars as Jim Stark, a rebellious youth who is a new kid in town and the new kid in school. Nobody, not even his parents or the police can understand what exactly is fueling Jim's rebellious behavior. Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo also star as Judy and Plato, two of Jim's friends that also have problems of their own and issues with their parents. This is a very complex drama that makes a gripping statement about teenage angst and the communication gap that exists between parents and their children. This is an excellent film that transcends time and still has the ability to speak to generations of youth. The film features breathtaking performances from James Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo. Jim Backus and Ann Doran also give first-rate performances in their roles as Jim's parents, as does William Hopper as Judy's father.

Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[1, 2]","SEPTEMBER 30TH--Screen icon James Dean died exactly fifty years ago today in a tragic automobile crash in California's central valley.  With EAST OF EDEN and REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE (both 1955), made back to back before his untimely death at age 24, Dean immortalized himself for an entire generation.  Both films are devastating and emotionally overwhelming even today in their portraits of dissatisfied young people in conflict with their parents and one another.  Of the two, I prefer director Nicholas Ray's REBEL, with a brilliant screenplay by Stewart Stern.The setting is 1955 Los Angeles, where Dean's Jim Stark is the new boy in high school.  He inevitably comes into conflict with a gang led by Corey Allen and a very young Dennis Hopper, among others.  (Trivia note:  Dean and Hopper are both featured prominently in GIANT, released the following year.)  A knife fight at hilltop Griffith Observatory leads to a deadly ""Chicken Run"".  The settings are imaginative, including the observatory and an abandoned mansion in the Hollywood Hills with an empty swimming pool.  I was reminded of the old house and pool in Billy Wilder's SUNSET BLVD. (1950).(CAUTION:  PLOT SPOILERS THROUGHOUT.)  REBEL also stars Natalie Wood as Judy and Sal Mineo as Plato; both give Oscar-nominated and unforgettable performances.  Judy has parents who are unpleasant.  Dad William Hopper slaps her when she kisses his cheek, while Mom Rochelle Hudson just sort of stands by.  ""This is not my house!"" Judy says after one slap too many and runs out into the night.  Plato lives with a house maid; I believe his parents are dead.  But the real spotlight is on Jim's parents, weakling Jim Backus and strong-willed Ann Doran who keeps berating Backus.  In the deadly ""Chicken Run"", a key gang member dies when his car plunges over a cliff with him in it.  But the other gang members still chase after Jim to make sure he does not confess what he knows to a sympathetic cop (Edward Platt).Eventually, Jim and Judy and Plato form their own family of three in the abandoned mansion below the observatory.  They make a poignant trio, and the three actors-who all met tragic ends in real life-are unforgettable as they just chat about life, their parents, and why no one understands them.  When the gang members descend on the mansion, followed by the cops, you know things will turn out unhappily.  The ending packs a real wallop, helped by Leonard Rosenman's invisible, but powerful score.  (His score for EAST OF EDEN is towering, one of the 1950's best.)  REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE is a truly great film, one of the real classics of the American cinema.The letterboxed videocassette I am reviewing has 45 minutes of bonus material-B&W; behind-the-scenes TV documentaries with actor/host Gig Young, a jaw-dropping auto safety short (that was banned from TV) with the real James Dean, screen tests, a different and weaker ending, and glimpses of what the movie would have looked like in original B&W; before Jack Warner wisely decided to do it all in color.  These bonuses also seem to be on the DVD.(Reviewed from letterboxed videocassette.)",5,An emotionally overwhelming drama about young people,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,3116,"['SEPTEMBER', '30TH', 'Screen', 'icon', 'James', 'Dean', 'died', 'exactly', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'today', 'tragic', 'automobile', 'crash', 'California', 'central', 'valley', 'EAST', 'OF', 'EDEN', 'REBEL', 'WITHOUT', 'A', 'CAUSE', '1955', 'made', 'back', 'back', 'untimely', 'death', 'age', '24', 'Dean', 'immortalized', 'entire', 'generation', 'films', 'are', 'devastating', 'emotionally', 'overwhelming', 'even', 'today', 'portraits', 'dissatisfied', 'young', 'people', 'conflict', 'parents', 'one', 'two', 'prefer', 'director', 'Nicholas', 'Ray', 'REBEL', 'brilliant', 'screenplay', 'Stewart', 'Stern.The', 'setting', '1955', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'Dean', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'new', 'boy', 'high', 'school', 'inevitably', 'conflict', 'gang', 'led', 'Corey', 'Allen', 'very', 'young', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'others', 'Trivia', 'note', 'Dean', 'Hopper', 'are', 'featured', 'prominently', 'GIANT', 'released', 'following', 'year', 'knife', 'fight', 'hilltop', 'Griffith', 'Observatory', 'deadly', 'Chicken', 'Run', 'settings', 'are', 'imaginative', 'including', 'observatory', 'abandoned', 'mansion', 'Hollywood', 'Hills', 'empty', 'swimming', 'pool', 'was', 'reminded', 'old', 'house', 'pool', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'SUNSET', 'BLVD', '1950', 'CAUTION', 'PLOT', 'SPOILERS', 'THROUGHOUT', 'REBEL', 'also', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Judy', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'Plato', 'give', 'Oscar-nominated', 'unforgettable', 'performances', 'Judy', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'unpleasant', 'Dad', 'William', 'Hopper', 'when', 'cheek', 'Mom', 'Rochelle', 'Hudson', 'just', 'sort', 'stands', 'not', 'house', 'Judy', 'one', 'slap', 'too', 'many', 'out', 'night', 'Plato', 'house', 'maid', 'believe', 'parents', 'are', 'dead', 'real', 'spotlight', 'Jim', 'parents', 'weakling', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'strong-willed', 'Ann', 'Doran', 'who', 'berating', 'Backus', 'deadly', 'Chicken', 'Run', 'key', 'gang', 'member', 'when', 'car', 'plunges', 'cliff', 'other', 'gang', 'members', 'still', 'chase', 'Jim', 'make', 'sure', 'not', 'confess', 'what', 'sympathetic', 'cop', 'Edward', 'Platt', '.Eventually', 'Jim', 'Judy', 'Plato', 'form', 'own', 'family', 'three', 'abandoned', 'mansion', 'observatory', 'make', 'poignant', 'trio', 'three', 'actors-who', 'met', 'tragic', 'ends', 'real', 'life-are', 'unforgettable', 'just', 'chat', 'life', 'parents', 'why', 'one', 'When', 'gang', 'members', 'descend', 'mansion', 'followed', 'cops', 'know', 'things', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'unhappily', 'ending', 'packs', 'real', 'wallop', 'helped', 'Leonard', 'Rosenman', 'invisible', 'powerful', 'score', 'score', 'EAST', 'OF', 'EDEN', 'towering', 'one', '1950', 'best', 'REBEL', 'A', 'CAUSE', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'real', 'classics', 'American', 'cinema.The', 'letterboxed', 'videocassette', 'am', 'reviewing', '45', 'minutes', 'bonus', 'material-B', 'W', 'behind-the-scenes', 'TV', 'documentaries', 'actor/host', 'Gig', 'Young', 'jaw-dropping', 'auto', 'safety', 'short', 'was', 'banned', 'TV', 'real', 'James', 'Dean', 'screen', 'tests', 'different', 'weaker', 'ending', 'glimpses', 'what', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'original', 'B', 'W', 'Jack', 'Warner', 'wisely', 'decided', 'do', 'color', 'bonuses', 'also', 'seem', 'be', 'DVD', 'Reviewed', 'letterboxed', 'videocassette']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

328083,A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,6302685141,"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[4, 6]","I went to high school in the late 1970's when 50's memorabilia was a big fad and silly, feel good, nostalgic shows like HAPPY DAYS (remember the Fonz?) and LAVERNE AND SHIRLEY ruled the airwaves and the movie GREASE was a box office phenomenon.  I had always heard the 50's described as a happy wholesome idyllic time for America and especially American teenagers.  What a shock then to see REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE a film actually made in 1955 with its contemporary depiction of self-destructive, angst ridden, upper middle class teenagers and their very dysfunctional families.The film opens at an LA police station where the three main characters, high school students Jim (James Dean), Judy (Natalie Wood) and Plato (Sal Mineo), have all been brought for unrelated offenses.  Jim's been picked up for drunkenness and has just moved to the area after an apparently trouble filled past and his ambitious parents are anxious for him to make a good impression at his new school.  Judy is a beautiful popular girl who is having lots of problems at home and was taken in to custody for breaking curfew.  Plato the small child like character played by Sal Mineo has absent parents and is being raised by a maid.  He has committed the most disturbing crime as he has shot some puppies.We see the three the next day at their high school and later at a symbol laden field trip to the planetarium at Griffith Park.  An altercation occurs at the observatory there which leads to a tragic ""chickie run"" on the bluffs over the Pacific Ocean.  Within the same 24 hour period Jim Judy and Plato draw close and even make a makeshift family of each other.  More tragedy is still in store for the kids and the climax shifts back again to the Griffith Park observatory.At times the film seems somewhat corny to modern viewers in part because of the dramatic musical score (very typical of the movie's day) that is too often played to punctuate climatic scenes.  The movie also is a bit heavy handed in its symbolism.  Jim's dad wears an apron over his suit to show how he is whipped by his wife, the theme of the planetarium show is the destruction of the earth, and Jim's awful mother's painting just happens to be standing near the doorway so Jim can kick through it when he storms out after a climatic fight. Much of the movie seems to have been filmed on location and there is a real feeling of LA in the 1950's throughout.There is some overacting but overall the lead characters do a good job. James Dean is very charismatic in the film and the viewer can see why he still has a cult following.  This is especially true when the morbid fact that he had been dead for about a month before this film was released is considered.  Natalie Wood is very believable as the emotionally confused Judy.  And Sal Mineo is heartbreaking as the troubled Plato who as his caretaker/maid says has ""nobody"".  The major themes of the film can resonate with parents and teens of today and this is a must see for any film lover.",4,Dark Side Of Happy Days,1195689600,"11 22, 2007",2007,2995,"['went', 'high', 'school', 'late', '1970', 'when', '50', 'memorabilia', 'was', 'big', 'fad', 'silly', 'feel', 'good', 'nostalgic', 'shows', 'HAPPY', 'DAYS', 'remember', 'Fonz', 'LAVERNE', 'AND', 'SHIRLEY', 'ruled', 'airwaves', 'movie', 'GREASE', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'phenomenon', 'had', 'always', 'heard', '50', 'described', 'happy', 'wholesome', 'idyllic', 'time', 'America', 'especially', 'American', 'teenagers', 'What', 'shock', 'then', 'see', 'REBEL', 'WITHOUT', 'A', 'CAUSE', 'film', 'actually', 'made', '1955', 'contemporary', 'depiction', 'self-destructive', 'angst', 'ridden', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'teenagers', 'very', 'dysfunctional', 'families.The', 'film', 'LA', 'police', 'station', 'where', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'Jim', 'James', 'Dean', 'Judy', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Plato', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'unrelated', 'offenses', 'Jim', 'been', 'picked', 'up', 'drunkenness', 'just', 'moved', 'area', 'apparently', 'trouble', 'filled', 'past', 'ambitious', 'parents', 'are', 'anxious', 'make', 'good', 'impression', 'new', 'school', 'Judy', 'beautiful', 'popular', 'girl', 'who', 'having', 'lots', 'problems', 'home', 'was', 'taken', 'custody', 'breaking', 'curfew', 'Plato', 'small', 'child', 'character', 'played', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'absent', 'parents', 'being', 'raised', 'maid', 'committed', 'most', 'disturbing', 'crime', 'shot', 'puppies.We', 'see', 'three', 'next', 'day', 'high', 'school', 'later', 'symbol', 'laden', 'field', 'trip', 'planetarium', 'Griffith', 'Park', 'altercation', 'observatory', 'tragic', 'chickie', 'run', 'bluffs', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'same', '24', 'hour', 'period', 'Jim', 'Judy', 'Plato', 'draw', 'close', 'even', 'make', 'makeshift', 'family', 'other', 'More', 'tragedy', 'still', 'store', 'kids', 'climax', 'back', 'again', 'Griffith', 'Park', 'observatory.At', 'film', 'somewhat', 'corny', 'modern', 'viewers', 'part', 'dramatic', 'musical', 'score', 'very', 'typical', 'movie', 'day', 'too', 'often', 'played', 'punctuate', 'climatic', 'scenes', 'movie', 'also', 'bit', 'heavy', 'handed', 'symbolism', 'Jim', 'dad', 'apron', 'suit', 'show', 'how', 'whipped', 'wife', 'theme', 'planetarium', 'show', 'destruction', 'earth', 'Jim', 'awful', 'mother', 'painting', 'just', 'be', 'standing', 'doorway', 'Jim', 'can', 'kick', 'when', 'out', 'climatic', 'fight', 'Much', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'location', 'real', 'feeling', 'LA', '1950', 'overacting', 'lead', 'characters', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'James', 'Dean', 'very', 'charismatic', 'film', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'still', 'cult', 'following', 'especially', 'true', 'when', 'morbid', 'fact', 'had', 'been', 'dead', 'month', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'considered', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'very', 'believable', 'emotionally', 'confused', 'Judy', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'heartbreaking', 'troubled', 'Plato', 'who', 'caretaker/maid', 'nobody', 'major', 'themes', 'film', 'can', 'resonate', 'parents', 'teens', 'today', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'lover']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS

Maybe a catchy title to draw in the crowds or a deliberate lie to show later that their cause, seeming meaningless, was a valid one. And in the end, this film is so poignant! Not a ""dated"" film at all, but a lesson to the generations of teenagers before and afterwards. Teenage angst has not changed in the last 50 years, and the reasons have not become any less meaningful. ""Rebel Without a Cause"" offers a very truthful look into the lives of teenagers, the reasons they rebel and gives a reason to why rebeliousness should not be taken so lightly.The movie begins with all three of the main characters Jim (James Dean) Judy (Natalie Wood) and Plato (Sal Mineo) in a police station in the wee hours of the morning. All are dressed in obviously middle and upper-class clothes but have been picked up on the street for wandering, drunkeness and violence. The title of the movie immediately gives itself away, Judy is upset because her father was rough with her, Plato's father left him and his mother is never at home...Then we meet Jim's parents. A submissive father, sharp-tongued mother and uptight grandmother. True, they may give him ""many things"" but the tension, strain and ignorance of Jim's needs are, as he says, ""tearing me apart!""We find out in the course of the movie, as Jim, Judy and Plato come together, that they are really good kids who are only looking for love and acceptance. We see how little their parents understand of them and how they are rebelling against the ignorance that has been starving them for years!And truly, this is my FAVORITE James Dean movie, I think his portrayal of Jim is really a mirror of his own life with his biological Dad and some of the kids he grew up with. His acting is just so true, real, passionate and believable. This movie is my reasoning for why he is still such a legend. Truly, one of the greatest actors of all time. And a fantastic movie to boot!And get this, the extra disc has all kinds of wonderful things the VHS tape had.  Cast interviews, screen tests, alternate endings, black and white clips, film changes!

Now, i believe that James Dean is not only an icon that people (esp. teens) should recognize for his outstanding role as a confused and volatile teen in Rebel, but quite simply a raw human being. He pretty much exemplified the outcry of most teenagers everywhere with this classic line from the film: ""You are tearing me apart!"" Who can't relate to that type of emotion that one feels for their  parents or friends, at times? I was surprised in how i could relate to the characters in the movie, even though they are nothing like me. That's why Rebel Without A Cause is timeless: it speaks for every young generation just as much as it did during Jame Dean's era. Also, everything else about this movie, the way it was made, the plot, the music, etc., just complements every aspect of the film. Of course, James Dean made this film what it is; it's amazing to see his character transform before our eyes, which is a very rare event to witness in a film.Unfortunately, the three primary characters--- Natalie Wood, James Dean, and Sal Mineo--- all experienced tragic ends.

328091,A3S98L5B1SR9P1,6302685141,Zack H.,"[5, 5]","""Rebel Without A Cause"" is one of the finest films ever created. The story is about a troubled youth that seeks redemption and a sense security through his family, but when they fail to do that he seeks comfort through friendship. James Dean, Natalie Woods, and the rest of the cast are great in this film, so it's no wonder why this movie is a classic. With great scenes like the chicken run car race or the arguements James has with his parents, you'll never want to turn off the T.V. The direction for this film seemed very powerful and had you in suspense throughout the film. One moment you'll be sad at some of James Dean's struggles in the movie, but then you'll be happy at some of his more happy scenes in the film. I think many of today's youth can identify with Dean's character, so making it that much more of a powerful film. Although the film does seem a bit paced at time, it doesn't ruin the experience. Overall, if you like movies, then you'll love this one.To the reviewer who asked if there is a Two-Disc Edition DVD coming: Yes, a Two-Disc SE is coming out on May 31st 2005!",5,Rebel Without a Cause,1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,1094,"['Rebel', 'Cause', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'ever', 'created', 'story', 'troubled', 'youth', 'redemption', 'sense', 'security', 'family', 'when', 'fail', 'do', 'comfort', 'friendship', 'James', 'Dean', 'Natalie', 'Woods', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'great', 'film', 'wonder', 'why', 'movie', 'classic', 'great', 'scenes', 'chicken', 'run', 'car', 'race', 'arguements', 'James', 'parents', ""'ll"", 'never', 'want', 'turn', 'off', 'T.V', 'direction', 'film', 'seemed', 'very', 'powerful', 'had', 'suspense', 'film', 'One', 'moment', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sad', 'James', 'Dean', 'struggles', 'movie', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'more', 'happy', 'scenes', 'film', 'think', 'many', 'today', 'youth', 'can', 'identify', 'Dean', 'character', 'making', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'film', 'film', 'seem', 'bit', 'paced', 'time', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'experience', 'Overall', 'like', 'movies', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'reviewer', 'who', 'asked', 'Two-Disc', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'coming', 'Yes', 'Two-Disc', 'SE', 'coming', 'out', 'May', '31st', '2005']",Rebel Without a Cause VHS
