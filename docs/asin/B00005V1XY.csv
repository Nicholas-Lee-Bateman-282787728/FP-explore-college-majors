Bad sounding names for musicals, theatrical fidelity & comedy in the emergency room.

686870,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00005V1XY,C. O. DeRiemer,"[3, 3]","Jeff Goldblum plays Dexter King, a tall American in London trying to establish himself as an actor. For the last two years he's been getting by playing stooge in the comedy act of a monumentally self-centered comedian, Ron Anderson, played by Rowan Atkinson. He meets Kate Lemmon, a nurse at a local hospital. In short order, he falls in love, gets fired by Anderson, is hired to play the lead in a London musical, has a fling, loses Kate, wins Kate back.The movie is funny and a bit whimsical, very clever, and is merciless at poking fun at the theater establishment. Dexter's big break, for instance, is playing John Merrick in Elephant!, a musical based on The Elephant Man. Think of third rate (or even first-rate) Andrew Lloyd-Weber. The book and songs are so awful and ponderous they're fascinating. Dexter's face makeup, in addition to huge lumps and ears, includes what looks like a small elephant's trunk attached to his nose.Goldblum narrates the movie and comes across as slightly neurotic but endearing, unsure of himself but able to come through when it counts. Emma Thompson's character is all brisk common sense with a big helping of drollness. They go to bed on their first date because, as Kate explains, it eliminates all the awkwardness later on. Their love making is hilarious and could have been directed by Buster Keaton. Rowan Atkinson, as usual, almost steals the movie. He has two or three routines on stage, one with Goldblum as stooge with both playing singing, dancing off-color nuns. ""Is something bothering you, Dexter?"" Atkinson's character asks solicitously afterwards backstage. ""Well, yes there is,"" Dexter says. ""Then sort it out,"" Atkinson snarls, ""before I sack you and hire a lobotomized monkey to play your role."" The happy resolution of the movie takes place in the emergency room of Kate's hospital where various badly damaged people are being brought in...maimed accident victims, a heart attack case, a fellow with a vacuum cleaner pipe lodged up his bottom. Somehow it all works out.This is a sweet, funny, intelligent movie with three first-rate lead actors.The DVD looks very good.",5,"A Very Funny, Clever and Romantic Movie",1102291200,"12 6, 2004",2004,2127,"['Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Dexter', 'King', 'tall', 'American', 'London', 'trying', 'establish', 'actor', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'been', 'getting', 'playing', 'stooge', 'comedy', 'act', 'monumentally', 'self-centered', 'comedian', 'Ron', 'Anderson', 'played', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'Kate', 'Lemmon', 'nurse', 'local', 'hospital', 'short', 'order', 'love', 'fired', 'Anderson', 'hired', 'play', 'lead', 'London', 'musical', 'fling', 'Kate', 'Kate', 'back.The', 'movie', 'funny', 'bit', 'whimsical', 'very', 'clever', 'merciless', 'poking', 'fun', 'theater', 'establishment', 'Dexter', 'big', 'break', 'instance', 'playing', 'John', 'Merrick', 'Elephant', 'musical', 'based', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'Think', 'third', 'rate', 'even', 'first-rate', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd-Weber', 'book', 'songs', 'are', 'so', 'awful', 'ponderous', ""'re"", 'fascinating', 'Dexter', 'face', 'makeup', 'addition', 'huge', 'lumps', 'ears', 'what', 'small', 'elephant', 'trunk', 'attached', 'nose.Goldblum', 'movie', 'across', 'slightly', 'neurotic', 'endearing', 'unsure', 'able', 'come', 'when', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'character', 'brisk', 'common', 'sense', 'big', 'helping', 'drollness', 'go', 'bed', 'first', 'date', 'because', 'Kate', 'awkwardness', 'later', 'love', 'making', 'hilarious', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'directed', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'usual', 'almost', 'movie', 'two', 'three', 'routines', 'stage', 'one', 'Goldblum', 'stooge', 'playing', 'singing', 'dancing', 'off-color', 'nuns', 'something', 'bothering', 'Dexter', 'Atkinson', 'character', 'solicitously', 'afterwards', 'backstage', 'Well', 'yes', 'Dexter', 'Then', 'sort', 'out', 'Atkinson', 'snarls', 'sack', 'hire', 'lobotomized', 'monkey', 'play', 'role', 'happy', 'resolution', 'movie', 'place', 'emergency', 'room', 'Kate', 'hospital', 'where', 'various', 'badly', 'damaged', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'brought', 'maimed', 'accident', 'victims', 'heart', 'attack', 'case', 'fellow', 'vacuum', 'cleaner', 'pipe', 'lodged', 'up', 'bottom', 'Somehow', 'out.This', 'sweet', 'funny', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'three', 'first-rate', 'lead', 'actors.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'good']",N/A

That may mean that it's not terribly appealing to either people who like the British form of humour or those that like the American style, but I think it works very well!It's an absurd tale of an American actor (Jeff Goldblum) relegated to perform as a second banana for a West End favorite (Rowan Atkinson) in a London theatrical production. His allergies force him to go to the infirmary, but his view of a nurse (Emma Thompson) gets him over his dislike of injections and begins getting weekly shots from her, just to spend a moment of pleasurable pain in her presence. After finally getting a date, and upstaging his fellow thespian, and after getting sacked for it, he then lands the lead role in a new musical, all about the life of John ""The Elephant Man"" Merrick! But, of course, complications arise.The plot is helped greatly by the performances of unbelievable moments from the musical, and by a very raucous love scene with Goldblum and Thompson, one of the most violently joyous ones I've ever seen in a film! The three leads are all brilliant in their performances, especially Atkinson, who is much more Blackadder here, and not at all Mr. Bean.Ok.

686877,A1RJJ56MBJMX87,B00005V1XY,Gavin Wilson,"[5, 5]","Richard Curtis, eventual architect of 'Four Weddings', 'Notting Hill', 'Love Actually' and bits of 'Bridget Jones', kicked off his filmwriting career with this 1989 debut.It shows its youthfulness.  Just as 'Four Weddings' had at its core a string of sketches based on weddings Curtis had attended (but very skillfully linked by a romantic story), so 'The Tall Guy' appears to have started with the idea of a pastiche musical based on the Elephant Man, around which Curtis wraps a romance between a supporting actor and a nurse.Curtis's great buddy from Oxford, Rowan Atkinson, is brought in to play a control-freak comedian -- no type-casting there, then -- but there are a few ex-Cambridge people too: Emma Thompson, Mel Smith etc.  Jeff Goldblum is good as the lead, but there's no evidence that the script was specially written for him in particular or an American in general.This film is perhaps now best known for the slapstick sex scene between Thompson and Goldblum, which manages to be (slightly) erotic while also revealing a basic truth about the domestic tidiness of all nurses I have known.Many of the standard Curtis plot elements appear in a formative stage for this film: the early sexual encounter, followed by the break-up, followed by a finale in which the protagonists make a grand declaration of true love in front of a large crowd, the pop video sequence etc etc.I suspect this is now a budget-priced DVD because Curtis is slightly embarrassed by it.  But it's 88 enjoyable minutes of good, largely clean fun.  As ever, Emma Thompson is the most convincing actor on the screen.  Fifteen years on, she talks frankly about her varicose veins and growing old.  It's probably handy to have a film which she can now show her children and say ""This is what I used to look like before anything drooped.""Soon after making this, Curtis co-wrote the brilliant 'Blackadder Goes Forth' series for Rowan and friends, which was one of the comic masterpieces of the 1980s.  Clearly outstanding at TV scriptwriting, Curtis may have felt after 'The Tall Guy' that he hadn't proved himself on the movie screen.  But the movies were where the real money was (for writers), and five years later, Curtis perfected the formula with 'Four Weddings'.",3,Early work from Curtis the movie scriptwriter,1086220800,"06 3, 2004",2004,2248,"['Richard', 'Curtis', 'eventual', 'architect', ""'Four"", 'Weddings', ""'Notting"", 'Hill', 'Actually', 'bits', ""'Bridget"", 'Jones', 'kicked', 'off', 'filmwriting', 'career', '1989', 'debut.It', 'youthfulness', 'Just', ""'Four"", 'Weddings', 'had', 'core', 'string', 'sketches', 'based', 'weddings', 'Curtis', 'had', 'attended', 'very', 'skillfully', 'linked', 'romantic', 'story', 'so', ""'The"", 'Tall', 'Guy', 'have', 'started', 'idea', 'pastiche', 'musical', 'based', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'Curtis', 'romance', 'supporting', 'actor', 'nurse.Curtis', 'great', 'buddy', 'Oxford', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'brought', 'play', 'control-freak', 'comedian', 'type-casting', 'there', 'then', 'are', 'few', 'ex-Cambridge', 'people', 'too', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Mel', 'Smith', 'etc', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'good', 'lead', 'evidence', 'script', 'was', 'specially', 'written', 'particular', 'American', 'general.This', 'film', 'perhaps', 'now', 'best', 'known', 'slapstick', 'sex', 'scene', 'Thompson', 'Goldblum', 'be', 'slightly', 'erotic', 'also', 'revealing', 'basic', 'truth', 'domestic', 'tidiness', 'nurses', 'have', 'known.Many', 'standard', 'Curtis', 'plot', 'elements', 'appear', 'formative', 'stage', 'film', 'early', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'followed', 'break-up', 'followed', 'finale', 'protagonists', 'make', 'grand', 'declaration', 'true', 'love', 'front', 'large', 'crowd', 'pop', 'video', 'sequence', 'etc', 'etc.I', 'suspect', 'now', 'budget-priced', 'DVD', 'Curtis', 'slightly', 'embarrassed', '88', 'enjoyable', 'minutes', 'good', 'largely', 'clean', 'fun', 'ever', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'most', 'convincing', 'actor', 'screen', 'Fifteen', 'years', 'frankly', 'varicose', 'veins', 'growing', 'old', 'probably', 'handy', 'have', 'film', 'can', 'now', 'show', 'children', 'say', 'what', 'used', 'look', 'anything', 'drooped', 'Soon', 'making', 'Curtis', 'co-wrote', 'brilliant', ""'Blackadder"", 'Goes', 'Forth', 'series', 'Rowan', 'friends', 'was', 'one', 'comic', 'masterpieces', '1980s', 'Clearly', 'outstanding', 'TV', 'scriptwriting', 'Curtis', 'may', 'have', 'felt', ""'The"", 'Tall', 'Guy', 'had', ""n't"", 'proved', 'movie', 'screen', 'movies', 'were', 'where', 'real', 'money', 'was', 'writers', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'Curtis', 'perfected', 'formula', ""'Four"", 'Weddings']",N/A

686880,AQLZFWVUC7SQF,B00005V1XY,John C,"[0, 0]","We first saw this little-known gem of a film on premium cable at least fifteen years ago on a warm summer evening. My wife laughed so hard the next day our neighbors asked her what was so funny since they heard her through their open windows. I recently surprised her with the DVD and she laughed just as hard over certain scenes. Me too.Jeff Goldblum plays an American actor working in British theater supporting Rowan Atkinson who's his egotistical boss from Hell. He falls in love with a nurse played by Emma Thompson and they have the funniest sex scene during which they trash her bedroom. You have to see it to believe it and if you don't laugh, there's something wrong with you. These actors and rest of the cast fill out their parts nicely with the barrage of visual and verbal jokes which hold up on repeated viewings. Goldblum is a big-eyed lovable schmuck who learns some life lessons the hard way mostly from Atkinson. A little of this rubberfaced comic goes a long way; that's one of the reasons he's an English national treasure. People forget that Thompson started in comedy as she capably holds her own against these two scene stealers with different styles. Goldblum is more of a sadsack where Atkinson wastes no time in going for the throat.I clearly remember the sex scene after all these years as well as a musical production of 'The Elephant Man.' That concept alone is funny in its own right. It's a great send up of Sondheim's 'Sweeney Todd' mishmashed with Lloyd Webber's 'Cats,' both shows we had the pleasure of seeing on Broadway with their original casts. Some here don't think it holds up to 'Springtime for Hitler' but if you're familiar with those two musicals, you'll get the parodies and be just as amused.Both scenes hold up well after all these years as well as the rest of the story. However some reviewers here have commented about how the film was shortened from 93 minutes to 85. According to Wikipedia: 'There are significant differences between the American release of the film and the original version, including cut or replaced scenes and overdubbing of British slang and popular culture references.' I guess Miramax underestimated the intelligence of American audiences who were familiar with Monty Python and other British TV comedies seen here on public television. I can't recall if we saw the original version years ago, but if you don't know what you're missing here it shouldn't stop you from enjoying this delightful comedy with its biting satire of the British theater world if that's your cup of tea.Video quality is good when upscaled to 1080P and the original two channel stereo soundtrack is crisp & clear with some separation.

It ranks among my personal comedy favourites such as Blazing Saddles but for odd reasons.Others may focus on the rather sublime surrealism of the stage performances where Jeff Goldblum teams up with Rowan Atkinson on the London stage but for me the essence of this movie is the sending up of the Royal Shakespeare Company.Many of your readers will not be aware of a production that the RSC did of the horror flick Carrie. I am. I was there and lived to tell the tale. Needless to say the concept was horribly flawed and clearly did not attract much in the way of customer support and thankfully had only a short shelf life.The Tall Guy has some marvellous moments for instance the feather scene as well as a cartwheeling Goldblum on a hill in front of a large full moon. Emma Thompson in an unfamiliar role as an endearing nurse but the highlight of this quirky British movie has to be the scenes which centre on the RSC musical ""Elephant"".Any of your readers who are familiar with the theatre aristocracy in England will know of the position of the RSC in that hierarchy. In recent years the question of government financing, the Barbican theatre location in London have all been major drama productions with the whole entertainment world being given free seats by that great arts patron, the media. The RSC is a self-contained little world much like a living opera with extravagant gestures and larger than life characters. And here's the rub. Elephant exposes a lot of the inner workings of the RSC and pokes fun at them. And a good thing too. A production company which produces a Romeo and Juliet where Romeo dies by an intavenous injection of poison deserves to be poked fun at.Seriously though, the good thing about this is that it does show that the Brits can poke fun at their revered institutions whether they be Parliament or the RSC and not take everything too seriously.Watching the VHS version again recently in eager anticipation of the DVD release I was struck by the realisation that two masterly comic productions have yet to air on VHS or DVD which would find great favour with US audiences: Not the 9 O'Clock News and Spitting Image.On a final note there is something for music buffs too, the sight of...No I will not spoil it. Have great fun with this DVD. Now what about Yellowbeard?Postscript March 29 2002.After watching the DVD several times, I dug out my old PAL copy of the movie which I had devotedly brought over with me from merry olde England. I was aghast to find that six minutes have been cut, all of which is unnecessary and detract from the movie. The cuts are not pretty and should be restored. Please, if anyone out there is reading who has the authority to correct this butcher's savagery, please do so. There really is no need to chop this delightful movie...after all the sex was left in. If you can, try to see the original movie. It will make more sense that way....",5,The Royal Shakespeare company Spoof par excellence,1015200000,"03 4, 2002",2002,2928,"['love', 'movie', 'personal', 'comedy', 'favourites', 'such', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'odd', 'reasons.Others', 'may', 'focus', 'rather', 'sublime', 'surrealism', 'stage', 'where', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'up', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'London', 'stage', 'essence', 'movie', 'sending', 'Royal', 'Shakespeare', 'Company.Many', 'readers', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'aware', 'production', 'RSC', 'did', 'horror', 'flick', 'Carrie', 'am', 'was', 'there', 'lived', 'tell', 'tale', 'Needless', 'say', 'concept', 'was', 'horribly', 'flawed', 'clearly', 'did', 'not', 'attract', 'much', 'way', 'customer', 'support', 'thankfully', 'had', 'only', 'short', 'shelf', 'life.The', 'Tall', 'Guy', 'marvellous', 'moments', 'instance', 'feather', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'cartwheeling', 'Goldblum', 'hill', 'front', 'large', 'full', 'moon', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'unfamiliar', 'role', 'endearing', 'nurse', 'highlight', 'quirky', 'British', 'movie', 'be', 'scenes', 'centre', 'RSC', 'musical', 'Elephant', '.Any', 'readers', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'theatre', 'aristocracy', 'England', 'will', 'know', 'position', 'RSC', 'hierarchy', 'recent', 'years', 'question', 'government', 'financing', 'Barbican', 'theatre', 'location', 'London', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'drama', 'productions', 'whole', 'entertainment', 'world', 'being', 'given', 'free', 'seats', 'great', 'arts', 'patron', 'media', 'RSC', 'self-contained', 'little', 'world', 'much', 'living', 'opera', 'extravagant', 'gestures', 'larger', 'life', 'characters', 'here', 'rub', 'Elephant', 'lot', 'inner', 'workings', 'RSC', 'pokes', 'fun', 'good', 'thing', 'too', 'production', 'company', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'where', 'Romeo', 'intavenous', 'injection', 'poison', 'deserves', 'be', 'poked', 'fun', 'at.Seriously', 'good', 'thing', 'show', 'Brits', 'can', 'poke', 'fun', 'revered', 'institutions', 'be', 'Parliament', 'RSC', 'not', 'take', 'everything', 'too', 'seriously.Watching', 'VHS', 'version', 'again', 'recently', 'eager', 'anticipation', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'struck', 'realisation', 'two', 'masterly', 'comic', 'productions', 'have', 'yet', 'air', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'would', 'find', 'great', 'favour', 'US', 'audiences', 'Not', '9', ""O'Clock"", 'News', 'Spitting', 'Image.On', 'final', 'note', 'something', 'music', 'buffs', 'too', 'sight', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'Have', 'great', 'fun', 'DVD', 'Now', 'what', 'Yellowbeard', 'Postscript', 'March', '29', '2002.After', 'watching', 'DVD', 'several', 'times', 'dug', 'out', 'old', 'PAL', 'copy', 'movie', 'had', 'devotedly', 'brought', 'over', 'merry', 'olde', 'England', 'was', 'aghast', 'find', 'six', 'minutes', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'unnecessary', 'detract', 'movie', 'cuts', 'are', 'not', 'pretty', 'should', 'be', 'restored', 'Please', 'anyone', 'reading', 'who', 'authority', 'correct', 'butcher', 'savagery', 'please', 'do', 'so', 'really', 'need', 'chop', 'delightful', 'movie', 'sex', 'was', 'left', 'can', 'try', 'see', 'original', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'way']",N/A

But of course this was that awful 85 minute version. I mean, there are lead up to punch lines that never happen (in the begining of the movie, Jeff Goldblum is at his apartment, which he shares with an over sexed, and a bit inconsiderate, female friend, and is making himself a glass of OJ by pouring the remaining drips of several empty OJ containers, that he finds all over the apartment, into a glass. And just as he's managed to make the glass half full, he's distracted by one of his roomates naked boyfriends, entering the kitchen. He puts down the glass, which his room mate ends up drinking on him.

Goldblum plays a struggling American actor, Dexter King, in the West End of London, who finds himself out of work when he is sacked from his job as straight man to comedian Ron Anderson (Rowan Atkinson). He finds love, however, in the person of Kate Lemmon (whose name could have been worse, suggests Goldblum: Hitler or Tampon, for example), played by Emma Thompson. None of this, however, is worth parting with your hard-earned cash. Where the film really scores is in its hilarious satire on West End/Broadway musicals.Failing actor Dexter King lands the role of John Merrick in the National Theatre's latest sensation, Elephant!, the musical based on the story of the Elephant Man. There follows a brilliant parody of those smash-hit musicals churned out by the likes of Lloyd-Webber and Charles Schoenberg.
