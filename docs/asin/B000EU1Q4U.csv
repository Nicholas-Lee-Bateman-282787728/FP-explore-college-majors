Kochanski finally has a chance to have yogurt with pineapple in it. Kryten will finally be able to do more laundry. And oh yeah Red Dwarf is back along with Holly. But that's not all, the nanaites that left Kryten to explore the insides of Lister's underwear hamper to restore the ship have brought the orginal crew back as well. However they haven't a clue what is going on. Lister and the crew are brought up on charges by the captain and tries in vain to explain to them that they are in deep space and three million years away from Earth. The only one who is even willing to listen to them is Arnold J. Rimmer. Yes that's right Rimmer is back and he's still a smeg head hologram or real. The only way Rimmer is going to help Lister and the others is to get an edge. Lister gives him a disc with information on everyone and Rimmer checks out the wreckage of the Starbug and finds the luck virus and sexual magnetism. Rimmer is in for one crazy ride.  The trial has found them innocnet of the charges however they have wound up in the brig for giving Rimmer information on the crew and must serve a three year sentence in the ""tank"" the prison level of Red Dwarf. While inside Lister has signed them all up to be canries the prison fighting force that goes in and gets the job done or at least try. Thier first mission is to a wrecked ship on a water planet where they meet Cassandra a computer system so advanced it predicts the future. Cassandra has predicted Rimmers death and Rimmer of course will do anything to ensure that doesn't happen. Kryten hates being in the womens wing of the prison and some of the male inmates catch wind of this and reprogram him so he can show the male prisoners what they are missing.  Lister and Rimmer have gotten into trouble a number of times with the captain and they just don't seem to be catching a break. That is until Cat, Kochanski and Kryten come back from a mission with a time wand that could solve all of thier prison time troubles. But as well all know things never go easy for the crew as they learn first hand that messing with time can be dangerous. A virus designed to eat metal has been brought on board and begins to destroy Red Dwarf slowly. The crew abondons Red Dwarf leaving Lister, Cat, Kryten, Rimmer and Kochanski to figure this out with time running low. A chance idea to send one of them to a mirror universe to find a solution and maybe save Red Dwarf. But when its Rimmer who goes through will everything be alright or is this the last hours for Red Dwarf?So come onboard and check out Red Dwarf Series Eight today.",5,Red Dwarf Series Eight dishes out more laughs and Smegs then you know what to do with!,1321401600,"11 16, 2011",2011,2714,"['Red', 'Dwarf', 'Series', 'Eight', 'up', 'where', 'Seven', 'left', 'off', 'Dave', 'Lister', 'arm', 'back', 'Cat', 'finally', 'will', 'have', 'suits', 'back', 'Kochanski', 'finally', 'chance', 'have', 'yogurt', 'pineapple', 'Kryten', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'more', 'laundry', 'oh', 'yeah', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'back', 'along', 'Holly', 'not', 'nanaites', 'left', 'Kryten', 'explore', 'insides', 'Lister', 'underwear', 'hamper', 'restore', 'ship', 'have', 'brought', 'orginal', 'crew', 'back', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'have', ""n't"", 'clue', 'what', 'going', 'Lister', 'crew', 'are', 'brought', 'up', 'charges', 'captain', 'tries', 'vain', 'explain', 'are', 'deep', 'space', 'three', 'million', 'years', 'away', 'Earth', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'even', 'willing', 'listen', 'Arnold', 'J.', 'Rimmer', 'right', 'Rimmer', 'back', 'still', 'smeg', 'head', 'hologram', 'real', 'only', 'way', 'Rimmer', 'going', 'help', 'Lister', 'others', 'get', 'edge', 'Lister', 'disc', 'information', 'everyone', 'Rimmer', 'checks', 'out', 'wreckage', 'Starbug', 'luck', 'virus', 'sexual', 'magnetism', 'Rimmer', 'one', 'crazy', 'ride', 'trial', 'found', 'innocnet', 'charges', 'however', 'have', 'wound', 'up', 'brig', 'giving', 'Rimmer', 'information', 'crew', 'must', 'serve', 'three', 'year', 'sentence', 'tank', 'prison', 'level', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'inside', 'Lister', 'signed', 'up', 'be', 'canries', 'prison', 'fighting', 'force', 'job', 'done', 'least', 'try', 'Thier', 'first', 'mission', 'wrecked', 'ship', 'water', 'planet', 'where', 'meet', 'Cassandra', 'computer', 'system', 'so', 'advanced', 'future', 'Cassandra', 'predicted', 'Rimmers', 'death', 'Rimmer', 'course', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'ensure', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Kryten', 'being', 'womens', 'wing', 'prison', 'male', 'catch', 'wind', 'reprogram', 'so', 'can', 'show', 'male', 'prisoners', 'what', 'are', 'missing', 'Lister', 'Rimmer', 'have', 'gotten', 'trouble', 'number', 'times', 'captain', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'catching', 'break', 'Cat', 'Kochanski', 'Kryten', 'come', 'back', 'mission', 'time', 'wand', 'could', 'solve', 'thier', 'prison', 'time', 'troubles', 'as', 'well', 'all', 'know', 'things', 'never', 'go', 'easy', 'crew', 'learn', 'first', 'hand', 'messing', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'virus', 'designed', 'eat', 'metal', 'been', 'brought', 'board', 'destroy', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'slowly', 'crew', 'abondons', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'leaving', 'Lister', 'Cat', 'Kryten', 'Rimmer', 'Kochanski', 'figure', 'out', 'time', 'running', 'low', 'chance', 'idea', 'send', 'one', 'mirror', 'universe', 'find', 'solution', 'maybe', 'save', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'when', 'Rimmer', 'who', 'will', 'everything', 'be', 'alright', 'last', 'hours', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'So', 'come', 'onboard', 'check', 'out', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'Series', 'Eight', 'today']",Red Dwarf: VIII

And judging by all the reviews I'd heard about it saying it was the weakest series of them all, I wasn't looking forward to buying it at all.But after watching it, I have no idea what anyone is on about? It's as great as any other series, it's gone back to it's roots, the entire cast is back in force and it has plenty of classic moments.This time around they have gone back to the non-film looking footage, and back to a live audience. There is plenty of laughs and the series goes out on a high... leaving you just begging for a 9th series.The nano-bots from series 7 have reconstructed Red Dwarf, but they have also reconstructed the crew. So it's almost like its time travelled back to where Red Dwarf all begun, only it hasn't, and leaves many interesting possibilities to explore showing that the series isn't lost for idea's, it in fact ingeniously proves it's far from it.The bonus features are what's been seen on the other series DVD releases.

There are some great comedy moments in this season but most of the time i felt as though i was watching a half arsed version of the great comedy classic. You would think with Rimmer and Holly back along with the Skutters that the show would go right back to it's comedy roots but unfortunatly it all seems wrong somehow. The jokes don't feel as witty or as clever as the other series, in fact i found some of the jokes to be embarassing and painfully unfunny. All in all series 8 is a big let down.

On a fundamental level I don't really like the idea of bringing not only Red Dwarf, but also the entire crew, back from the dead. However if that's the idea they had to go with then this is probably the best execution that could have happened. It does manage to capture that trapped submarine feel of the first two series, without all the grey. The performances are spot on and it's great to have the original Holly back.

Felix and Oscar meet Dr. Who. The cast eventually turned into Felix and Oscar's poker game, with one of the Pidgeon Sisters sitting in. And this is what we're dealing with here.... After all their screwy, inventive adventures of the previous seven years, after the destruction or loss of the original Dwarf, the ship is reconstituted again by mysterious nanobots, with the original crew, including the REAL Rimmer, their CO, Peterson, Kachansky and everyone in one last season as the crew AGAIN causes the destruction of Red Dwarf and it's crew. Lister, Rimmer, Kachansky and Kryten get imprisoned for INITIALLY causing Red Dwarf's destruction, (even though Lister, Kryten and Kachansky had nothing to do with it!) and proceed to compound this by 1) escaping confinement 2) causing the devolution of a harmless canary into a T. Rex, 3) Having Kryten film the girls on the Dwarf showering naked and 4) consistently breaking minor infractions until their CO loses his mind, and 5) ultimately cause the destruction of Red Dwarf yet AGAIN!How the writers of this series came up with even the six stories a season they HAD of this program is beyond me! Some of the most inventive plotlines and situations you will ever see on series TV have come from Red Dwarf writers! It's as if the DC Comics bullpen, the writers from ""The Big Bang Theory"" and Dr. Who got together to produce a live action sci-fi comedy. Lister is the ultimate, regular-guy slob, and Rimmer is the ultimate deflatable anal-retentive know-it-all, with the ACTUAL fount of knowledge Kryten and the vain and stupid cat as counterpoints, along with the rethought Kachansky for distaff comedy. (Frankly, I preferred Claire Grogan to Chl&ouml;e Arnett, but what can you do?)This is the season that leaves a possible continuation open, despite the gruesome last scene of Rimmer seemingly being obliterated after the mysterious disappearance of his friends. Sets kept changing year after year, and the sets for this year gave the writers new directions to work with, which they did, using the brig setting to play new characters off of the regular crew. Funny, as usual....maybe not as funny as the landmark fifth season, which had so MANY brilliant episodes, but still not bad for eight seasons.Now, when the heck is that MOVIE coming out?",4,Smegheads of the world...

Compared to Red Dwarf at its finest (seasons 1-5), I think it's barely a 2.By season 8 the show was only a pale shadow of its former self.  I'm shocked at how un-funny it is.  Also, the actors have noticeably aged...their characters are meant to be twenty-something not, middle-aged.Back in the early 90s, Chris Barrie said he hoped Red Dwarf would have a ""proper ending"", i.e., wouldn't go on unnecessarily.

I own up to season 6 and have to say each season is better then the prior. 6 was a delite!My beef is why the price increase for the US DVD's. Amazon UK sells the UK versions for half the price we have to pay in the US. For instance 1-3 convert to be $14 USD each, 4 is $16, 5 is $17, 6 is $19, 7-8 are $23 each. Also they have a DVD set that is just the shows. 1-4 of this is only $20! 5-8 is $60. So for $80, you can purchase just the shows.They do have a 17.5% tax rate but that is their tax and goes to their government so it not part of this discussion.Lastly, what is the deal with the combo 7-8 pack for $81? Do you think we can't add? 7 is $35 and 8 is $35 = $70.

And now it's using it as core material while taking itself seriously.  This ""internal cultureshock"" is bad enough, but it's as much insulting as anything else given the sheer drop in quality of the stories themselves.  Few of which came across convincingly as epic, fewer of them were funny, and even the biggest gags (Rimmer and Lister kissing) still look forced.  Never mind the phony film effect applied to the video that doesn't work...  (""Blue"" being, by far, the best episode of Series 7...)But why am I talking about series 7?  Simple.  To show how much better 8 is.  Despite having a ship full of crew, the series feels more at home than its immediate predecessor.  Of course, the reason for having the ship back also means we should be seeing an extra Lister and Kochanski about, and the idea of which would have prevented the wrong stories getting too much padding and unwarranted screen time.""Back in the Red"" is the 3-part opener that's a bit long (try 2-parts instead, if only I could go back in time then afford a plane ticket to the UK so I could talk with the production team :-)  ), but at least it is pokes fun at itself with ""the Dibbley family"".  Things get long once we start seeing dancing Blue Midgets and a little too long Cat physical exam...  but it's reasonably good, and genuinely moving in parts.  Definitely better than anything series 7 vomited up.  If only they addressed the doubles for Kochanski and Lister.""Cassandra"" is an instant classic and the most ""old-school"" Dwarf of the bunch.  And intelligent in its writing.  Most refreshing from the usual ""physical comedy""...""Krytie TV"" is a bit raunchy, but is great fun too.""Pete"" is about 28 minutes too long and is easily the worst story presented.  It's about a dinosaur that gets really big and does big dinosaur things.  As this is ""Red Dwarf"", you can probably guess at half the jokes and the repetition of the jokes used...  Just think ""'Family Guy' only 7 years earlier"" then barf.""Only the Good"" is about 28 minutes too short and had the potential to be the best of this series, if not one of the top 3 stories of RD ever.  The concepts used are brilliant.  Unfortunately, this one is worthy as a 2-parter for the exposition and quality of jokes alone.  (which might be why it was shoehorned into a standard episode length.  :(  )  But it ends on one helluva cliffhanger, which would otherwise beat out ""Out of Time""'s cliffhanger except that story wasn't overloaded with ideas and as such could set everything up properly within its allotted time.As usual, we have a rich plethora of extras - alone making every series of RD worth purchasing.  Even RD VII.  It's good seeing the cast again, and I must say Craig Charles has aged well.  (of course, that cooking show knock-off that was in the series 4 release (Can't Smeg Won't Smeg) would have been more appropriate here...But at least 8 ends it all on a good note.

978935,A1NDYL6D6QNVCI,B000EU1Q4U,"Valnastar ""Man With No Name""","[48, 50]","Red Dwarf VIII, the last Red Dwarf series produced for television, is so far off the original premise and comedic style of the first few series of the show that in many ways it seems like a completely different show. Having an entire ship full of people with whom Lister can interact really shatters the great comedic premise on which Red Dwarf was created, that being that Lister is the last human left in the universe. Personally, I've never enjoyed the premise of bringing back the entire crew and then putting the main characters in prison for nearly the full eight episodes. While amusing, I believe this series has a lot of unwelcome changes and writing difficulties compared to earlier series of the show. The humor is less dense and less clever, often relying on gags that do not even approach the level of razor-edged wit prevalent in earlier episodes of the show.Nevertheless, there are a few bright spots in this series. Chris Barrie is back and the full cast of regulars is present for the entire series. And there is some occasionally inspired humor that still manages to make this better than most of the other shows on television. Cassandra particularly stands out as a good, ""classic"" Red Dwarf episode.Finally, the extra features, as on the other Red Dwarf DVD sets, are terrific, with Smeg Ups, deleted scenes, extended versions of two episodes, a making of documentary, commentary tracks, and much more.  The extra features alone are worth the price for any ""serious"" Red Dwarf fan. Based on that alone, I would recommend this set. Plus, what Red Dwarf fan can resist completing their collection? Sadly, as of this writing, Series VIII is the last Red Dwarf ever produced.Here is a synopsis of the plot of each episode in this set:Back In The Red Part IKryten's nanobots have recreated the ship Red Dwarf and the original crew as well, which is an especially good thing for Arnold Rimmer.Back In The Red Part IIRimmer uses a virus that enhances sexual magnetism to assist him with attracting female crewmembers, but this gets him into trouble when he dines at the captain's table.Back In The Red Part IIILister and his bunch face time in the brig for crimes against the Space Corps., so they escape to try and prove their innocence.CassandraLister joins a special military unit comprised of convicts, only to discover it's basically a suicide squad. Things get interesting when they face the all-knowing Cassandra. This episode is the one in Series VIII that is the most like a classic Red Dwarf episode from earlier series of the show; it is cleverly written and hilarious.Krytie TVKryten's private TV station is most amusing to his fellow prisoners, but the jokes are at the expense of others, which gets him into a bit of trouble.Pete Part IRimmer and Lister are forced play against the guards in a basketball game. They sabotage the opposition's half-time juice with a virility enhancement drug.Pete Part IIThe crew becomes the prey when a sparrow devolves into one of its large dinosaur ancestors.Only The GoodRimmer passes into a parallel universe where his other self is the ship's captain.",4,Wonderful and numerous extra features make this set worthwhile,1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,3116,"['Red', 'Dwarf', 'VIII', 'last', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'series', 'produced', 'television', 'so', 'far', 'original', 'premise', 'comedic', 'style', 'first', 'few', 'series', 'show', 'many', 'ways', 'completely', 'different', 'show', 'Having', 'entire', 'ship', 'full', 'people', 'whom', 'Lister', 'can', 'interact', 'really', 'great', 'comedic', 'premise', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'was', 'created', 'being', 'Lister', 'last', 'human', 'left', 'universe', 'Personally', ""'ve"", 'never', 'enjoyed', 'premise', 'bringing', 'back', 'entire', 'crew', 'then', 'putting', 'main', 'characters', 'prison', 'nearly', 'full', 'eight', 'episodes', 'amusing', 'believe', 'series', 'lot', 'unwelcome', 'changes', 'writing', 'difficulties', 'compared', 'earlier', 'series', 'show', 'humor', 'less', 'dense', 'less', 'clever', 'often', 'relying', 'gags', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'approach', 'level', 'razor-edged', 'wit', 'prevalent', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'show.Nevertheless', 'are', 'few', 'bright', 'spots', 'series', 'Chris', 'Barrie', 'back', 'full', 'cast', 'regulars', 'present', 'entire', 'series', 'occasionally', 'inspired', 'humor', 'still', 'make', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'shows', 'television', 'Cassandra', 'particularly', 'out', 'good', 'classic', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'episode.Finally', 'extra', 'features', 'other', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'DVD', 'sets', 'are', 'terrific', 'Smeg', 'Ups', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'extended', 'versions', 'two', 'episodes', 'making', 'documentary', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'much', 'more', 'extra', 'features', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'serious', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'fan', 'Based', 'alone', 'would', 'recommend', 'set', 'what', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'fan', 'can', 'resist', 'completing', 'collection', 'Sadly', 'writing', 'Series', 'VIII', 'last', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'ever', 'produced.Here', 'synopsis', 'plot', 'episode', 'set', 'Back', 'Red', 'Part', 'IKryten', 'nanobots', 'have', 'recreated', 'ship', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'original', 'crew', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'good', 'thing', 'Arnold', 'Rimmer.Back', 'Red', 'Part', 'IIRimmer', 'virus', 'sexual', 'magnetism', 'assist', 'attracting', 'female', 'crewmembers', 'trouble', 'when', 'captain', 'table.Back', 'Red', 'Part', 'IIILister', 'bunch', 'face', 'time', 'brig', 'crimes', 'Space', 'Corps.', 'escape', 'try', 'prove', 'innocence.CassandraLister', 'special', 'military', 'unit', 'comprised', 'convicts', 'only', 'discover', 'basically', 'suicide', 'squad', 'Things', 'get', 'interesting', 'when', 'face', 'all-knowing', 'Cassandra', 'episode', 'one', 'Series', 'VIII', 'most', 'classic', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'episode', 'earlier', 'series', 'show', 'cleverly', 'written', 'hilarious.Krytie', 'TVKryten', 'private', 'TV', 'station', 'most', 'amusing', 'fellow', 'prisoners', 'jokes', 'are', 'expense', 'others', 'bit', 'trouble.Pete', 'Part', 'IRimmer', 'Lister', 'are', 'forced', 'play', 'guards', 'basketball', 'game', 'sabotage', 'opposition', 'half-time', 'juice', 'virility', 'enhancement', 'drug.Pete', 'Part', 'IIThe', 'crew', 'prey', 'when', 'sparrow', 'one', 'large', 'dinosaur', 'ancestors.Only', 'GoodRimmer', 'parallel', 'universe', 'where', 'other', 'self', 'ship', 'captain']",Red Dwarf: VIII
