1453824,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B005CFBZVG,David Girod,"[0, 0]","One thing to note, the original film is not part of this collections, this only contains the first six sequels (2 more have been made since &#34;Revelation&#34;), so if you pick this up looking for the Linda Hamilton film, you'll have to grad that movie on another disk.I had bailed on this series after seeing part 2 in the theaters, but I love horror, and I love Stephen King, and at this price, I figured that even if I only found one or two films I liked, then it would be worth it. I have more thorough reviews posted under the single titles compiled here, but figured I would toss out a quick review for the collection as well.Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice - Taking up right after the events of the first film, we see what happens when a neighboring town takes in the kids who worshipped He Who Walks Behind the Rows. I didn't really care for it back in the day, but have to say I enjoyed it more with this second viewing. There is a streak of black humor that funs through this one and it's a lot of fun.Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest - Two brothers escape from an abusive father and are adopted by a young couple living in Chicago. The older brother begins to make friends, and starts coming out of his shell. The younger brother turns to He Who Walks Behind the Rows. I thought this one was going to be awful, but found myself really having fun with this entry. I thought the dynamic between the two brother really carried the film, and the performance were much better than expected.Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering - A young woman (Naomi Watts) returns to the family farm to help take care of her aging mother (Karen Black). Strange events begin to grip the town after an evil spirit is released from a well. This is hands down my favorite film in this collection. While this was the first direct-to-video film in this series, you can tell the people involved wanted to do the most with the meager budget they had. Full of atmosphere and scares, and featuring two Academy Award nominated actresses, this movie is worth the price of the disk alone.Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror - A group of kids set out to scatter the ashes of a friends who had recently died, and get stuck in the corn with murderous kids. This one is bad, there are some fields here, but no terror. If you want to see Eva Mendes in an early role, have at it, but there is nothing here to recommend.Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return - A young woman returns to Gatlin to find her biological mother, and discovers that she was the first child born of the murderous corn cult kids. Isaac, the boy preacher from the first film, has been in a coma since the original movie, and he wakes up wearing green contacts. Unfortunately, there is no menace to Isaac, at one point they show him in a bathrobe, using a walker to get around?? I liked that they brought back John Franklin from the original movie, but wish they had given him something to do.Children of the Corn: Revelation - A young woman travels to Nebraska looking for her missing grandmother. Staying at her grandma's run-down apartment building we meet a bunch of weirdo tenants, and there are some weirdo kids handing around, and somehow this may tie back to the events of Gatlin, even though the main focus is on a tent revival that burnt to the ground?? We do finally get some killer corn stalks and this was the first film in the series to have nudity....but it's painfully dull.For this price, this is a solid little collection, the first three films on the disk are well worth the price, and consider the other films as &#34;bonus&#34; material, if you've got nothing else to do, they make for good background noise.",4,He Who Walks Among the Sequels,1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,3702,"['One', 'thing', 'note', 'original', 'film', 'not', 'part', 'collections', 'only', 'first', 'six', 'sequels', '2', 'more', 'have', 'been', 'made', '34', 'Revelation', '34', 'so', 'pick', 'up', 'looking', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'film', ""'ll"", 'have', 'grad', 'movie', 'disk.I', 'had', 'bailed', 'series', 'seeing', 'part', '2', 'theaters', 'love', 'horror', 'love', 'Stephen', 'King', 'price', 'figured', 'even', 'only', 'found', 'one', 'two', 'films', 'liked', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'more', 'thorough', 'reviews', 'posted', 'single', 'titles', 'compiled', 'here', 'figured', 'would', 'toss', 'out', 'quick', 'review', 'collection', 'well.Children', 'Corn', 'II', 'Final', 'Sacrifice', 'Taking', 'up', 'right', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'see', 'what', 'when', 'neighboring', 'town', 'kids', 'who', 'worshipped', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Rows', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'back', 'day', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'second', 'viewing', 'streak', 'black', 'humor', 'one', 'lot', 'fun.Children', 'Corn', 'III', 'Urban', 'Harvest', 'Two', 'brothers', 'escape', 'abusive', 'father', 'are', 'adopted', 'young', 'couple', 'living', 'Chicago', 'older', 'brother', 'make', 'friends', 'coming', 'shell', 'younger', 'brother', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Rows', 'thought', 'one', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'awful', 'found', 'really', 'having', 'fun', 'entry', 'thought', 'dynamic', 'two', 'brother', 'really', 'carried', 'film', 'performance', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'expected.Children', 'Corn', 'IV', 'Gathering', 'young', 'woman', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'family', 'farm', 'help', 'take', 'care', 'aging', 'mother', 'Karen', 'Black', 'Strange', 'events', 'begin', 'grip', 'town', 'evil', 'spirit', 'released', 'well', 'down', 'favorite', 'film', 'collection', 'was', 'first', 'direct-to-video', 'film', 'series', 'can', 'tell', 'people', 'involved', 'wanted', 'do', 'most', 'meager', 'budget', 'had', 'Full', 'atmosphere', 'scares', 'featuring', 'two', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', 'actresses', 'movie', 'price', 'disk', 'alone.Children', 'Corn', 'V', 'Fields', 'Terror', 'group', 'kids', 'set', 'out', 'scatter', 'ashes', 'friends', 'who', 'had', 'recently', 'died', 'get', 'stuck', 'corn', 'murderous', 'kids', 'one', 'bad', 'are', 'fields', 'here', 'terror', 'want', 'see', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'early', 'role', 'have', 'nothing', 'here', 'recommend.Children', 'Corn', '666', 'Isaac', 'Return', 'young', 'woman', 'returns', 'Gatlin', 'find', 'biological', 'mother', 'discovers', 'was', 'first', 'child', 'born', 'murderous', 'corn', 'cult', 'kids', 'Isaac', 'boy', 'preacher', 'first', 'film', 'been', 'coma', 'original', 'movie', 'up', 'wearing', 'green', 'contacts', 'Unfortunately', 'menace', 'Isaac', 'one', 'point', 'show', 'bathrobe', 'using', 'walker', 'get', 'liked', 'brought', 'back', 'John', 'Franklin', 'original', 'movie', 'wish', 'had', 'given', 'something', 'do.Children', 'Corn', 'Revelation', 'young', 'woman', 'Nebraska', 'looking', 'missing', 'grandmother', 'Staying', 'grandma', 'run-down', 'apartment', 'building', 'meet', 'bunch', 'weirdo', 'tenants', 'are', 'weirdo', 'kids', 'handing', 'around', 'somehow', 'may', 'tie', 'back', 'events', 'Gatlin', 'even', 'main', 'focus', 'tent', 'revival', 'ground', 'do', 'finally', 'get', 'killer', 'corn', 'stalks', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'have', 'nudity', 'painfully', 'dull.For', 'price', 'solid', 'little', 'collection', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'disk', 'are', 'well', 'price', 'consider', 'other', 'films', '34', 'bonus', '34', 'material', ""'ve"", 'got', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'make', 'good', 'background', 'noise']",The Children of the Corn Collection

1453827,A27W5AJNP6YX7Z,B005CFBZVG,"Ivy Bewley ""Hiedra""","[10, 11]","So here I am, a fan of Karen Black, who has done some pretty wacky roles (one of the reasons I like her). And she is in Children of the Corn. Imagine my surprise to find out there are 3 movies before and 3 movies after the movie she is in. I am about to forget it when I find out I can get the whole series for less than the price of one new release. Movie #1 is for whatever reason not included in this set, but I got that for $5 on eBay.Since this is 6 movies and they all have their own detailed reviews on here, I'll be brief. Although I wonder: how did a short story end up being a movie series consisting of over 10 hours? It's usually Stephen King's incredibly long books that end up being miniseries. (One I really enjoyed wasStephen King's The Stand.)Movie #2 was good. #3 was good... until the end. That big slimy monster was just weird. They used monster technology that was just not perfected yet. And even if it had been, it didn't make much sense. Before that, the evil force had simply been that subtle wave beneath the dirt in the cornfields. Simple yet scary. Not to mention the cornstalks that can strangle people. #4 was the movie that included Karen Black. Her role was appropriately weird. #5 and #6 were OK. #7 would have been fine except... it really didn't make sense as an end to the series. There were barely any cornfields. The grandmother was supposed to be the only child worshiper of ""he who walks behind the rows"" who survived. But then, why did it not take place in the year 2050 or something? Apparently, because it explained the beginning of everything. But if all the children died off 75 years ago, then where did all the children in the first 6 movies come from? I guess what irritated me was all of the not-quite-endings in all the movies that were never tied up in the subsequent sequels. But, it does seem that it is finally over.Overall, not a bad set. Horror is not one of my favorite genres, but as a series, it did pretty well. It probably went on too long, but many series do! It would have been better if ANY actors had continued from one movie to the next. (We finally got a repeat in movie #6.)",3,Not a bad series,1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,2142,"['So', 'here', 'am', 'fan', 'Karen', 'Black', 'who', 'done', 'pretty', 'wacky', 'roles', 'one', 'reasons', 'Children', 'Corn', 'Imagine', 'surprise', 'find', 'out', 'are', '3', 'movies', '3', 'movies', 'movie', 'am', 'forget', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'can', 'get', 'whole', 'series', 'less', 'price', 'one', 'new', 'release', 'Movie', '1', 'reason', 'not', 'included', 'set', 'got', '5', 'eBay.Since', '6', 'movies', 'have', 'own', 'detailed', 'reviews', 'here', ""'ll"", 'be', 'brief', 'wonder', 'how', 'did', 'short', 'story', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'movie', 'series', 'consisting', '10', 'hours', 'usually', 'Stephen', 'King', 'incredibly', 'long', 'books', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'miniseries', 'One', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'wasStephen', 'King', 'Stand', 'Movie', '2', 'was', 'good', '3', 'was', 'good', 'end', 'big', 'slimy', 'monster', 'was', 'just', 'weird', 'used', 'monster', 'technology', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'perfected', 'yet', 'even', 'had', 'been', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'evil', 'force', 'had', 'simply', 'been', 'subtle', 'wave', 'dirt', 'cornfields', 'Simple', 'yet', 'scary', 'Not', 'mention', 'cornstalks', 'can', 'strangle', 'people', '4', 'was', 'movie', 'included', 'Karen', 'Black', 'role', 'was', 'appropriately', 'weird', '5', '6', 'were', 'OK.', '7', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'end', 'series', 'were', 'barely', 'cornfields', 'grandmother', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'only', 'child', 'worshiper', 'who', 'walks', 'rows', 'who', 'survived', 'then', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'year', '2050', 'something', 'Apparently', 'explained', 'beginning', 'everything', 'children', 'died', '75', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'where', 'did', 'children', 'first', '6', 'movies', 'come', 'guess', 'what', 'irritated', 'was', 'not-quite-endings', 'movies', 'were', 'never', 'tied', 'up', 'subsequent', 'sequels', 'seem', 'finally', 'over.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'set', 'Horror', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'genres', 'series', 'did', 'pretty', 'well', 'probably', 'went', 'too', 'long', 'many', 'series', 'do', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'ANY', 'actors', 'had', 'continued', 'one', 'movie', 'next', 'finally', 'got', 'repeat', 'movie', '6']",The Children of the Corn Collection
