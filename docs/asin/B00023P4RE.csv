She didn't in real life.  And its kind of sad to watch her as well knowing that she battled anorexia all her life.  If it is true that the camera adds ten pounds then Dee was rail thin because she's nothing but skin and bones in this feature, although still beautiful and charming.Darin does well by his role and he's too charming not to be loveable.The movie is worth a look but it won't be among my favorites.

The sparks fly and they're soon married, though Eugene still clings to his comfortable bachelor lifestyle.  Chantal's mother (Micheline Presle) supplies her with the key to the perfect marriage...a book on how to train your dog!  The same principles apply to husbands, apparently.  Pretty soon, Chantal has Eugene precision-trained, until the situation dissolves into comedic chaos when he discovers the deception...and turns the tables on Chantal!IF A MAN ANSWERS is a delightful screen outing for Dee and Darin, and while the movie as a whole seems a direct steal from ""Pillow Talk"", it's a very fun ride.  It's great seeing Micheline Presle here, too.  The movie also features John Lund, Cesar Romero and Stefanie Powers.The DVD transfer is sharp and bright for the most part, tightly-letterboxed in 2.00:1 anamorphic widescreen.

And they were madly in love and expecting their first child Dodd. That year Universal decided to cast them together once again, in a fun little comedy called If A Man Answers.Cantel Stacy (Sandra Dee), is a beautiful young lady who loves to play the field and has a lot of men around her little manicured fingers. Well one night daddy tells her that she needs to stop pussyfooting around and get married. Well she finds herself engaged to 3 men the next day, and starts bawling. They later get the problem solved after they move. The same day that they move to New York, Chantel is walking in front of a department store when Eugene Wilright (Bobby Darin) sees her and gives her his card about a modeling agency and asks her if she'd like to do some modelling. She says no and storms off. But the next day she shows up, at first Eugene is not to anxious about her doing any work with him but when after she takes off her coat he changes his mind. During the middle of the shoot Chantel's overly strict father walks in and punches Eugene in the nose and drags Chantel out of there. Shortly after Eugene and Chantel get married everything is peaches in cream for a while, until Chantel's best friend from high school portrayed by Stefanie Powers comes to visit for a while. That's when Chantel's french momma, tells her the way to keep your hubby in line with a certain dog training manual. Well Chantel takes the advice and uses it and it works well. But after Eugene finds out he gets even madder, and Chantel's momma makes up a lover for Chantel to get Eugene back. But that annoys Eugene even more, than the lover actually shows up in the form of Ceasar Romero, at first Chantel is very worried but later finds out that Ceasar Romero is Eugen's father and they are just playing a game with her.

Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 2]","Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee were both popular stars of the late 1950s; in 1960 they married, and the film industry was quick to feature them in a series of films that might be described as ""Rock Hudson and Doris Day Junior.""  The films were bedroom farces with far more innuendo than action, and while Darin and Dee never hit the comic heights of such Hudson and Day films as PILLOW TALK, their own movies were entertaining and charming enough to make them something of a screen team.Released in 1962, IF A MAN ANSWERS is the clever story of daughter Chantal (Dee) whose father is a stuffy Bostonian and mother a worldly wise Parisian.  She falls in love with and marries photographer Eugene (Darin), but she soon finds the honeymoon is over.  Her mother Germaine (Micheline Presle) presents her with a solution: a dog training manual.  Chantal is shocked, but she soon finds the book's rules and tips invaluable, and not only does the romance come back into the marriage, her husband seems much more content than previously.  Until, of course, he discovers the manual and puts two and two together.IF A MAN ANSWERS is nicely scripted and well performed, with Dee particularly memorable.  Darin isn't much of an actor, and in spite of their real-life romance they are at best a mild sizzle as a screen team (they would have an extremely nasty divorce five years later.)  Fortunately a memorable supporting cast, including  Micheline Presle, a young Stephanie Powers, and Cesar Romero are on hand to brighten the corners.  Overall, IF A MAN ANSWERS is a cute movie, but not a memorable one.

In an old Vanity Fair article about Darin's life, the author of the piece refers to their films as ""dim bulb attempts to turn the couple into a junior version of Rock Hudson and Doris Day."" And in Kevin Spacey's wonderful movie about Darin's life, ""Beyond the Sea"", his voiceover as Darin narrates at one point, ""Sandy and I made a couple of movies together, but they were dogs.""Well, I think that the critics were wrong! OK, so these movies weren't full of Oscar worthy material, but that doesn't mean they were BAD. On the contrary, I thought If a Man Answers was really cute and clever. I even had my reservations because I know how contrived the ""battle of the sexes"" films of the early and mid 60s can be, and I could have done without the long animated sequence at the beginning of this movie (and in fact, I had to skip past it by one point), but once Sandra Dee's character meets Bobby Darin's character the movie finally picks up. It gets especially amusing when she begins training him as a dog (I really did find myself laughing out loud at several moments) and I really loved the ""revenge"" that Bobby's character pulls on Sandra Dee's character and her mother towards the end, with a little help from his father played by Cesar Romero. A very young Stephanie Powers also has a juicy but a bit diabolical role in this one as well.I'm a huge Bobby Darin fan but the movie gave me a deeper appreciation for his beautiful then-wife, Sandra Dee, as well. The two seemed perfect for each other with great chemistry for this type of film, and were absolutely adorable together.

823672,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00023P4RE,Kevin Killian,"[83, 101]","CNN and other news networks have announced the sad news that our beloved Sandra Dee has died this morning at 6:00 a.m. of complications of kidney disease and pneumonia.  She was with her son, Dodd Darin, who made the announcement to the press some hours later.For those of us who admired her work in films, this is a sad day indeed.  She was ""before my time"" but I never saw a Sandra Dee picture I didn't love.  She was a child model, and a teen star, and she married the pop singer Bobby Darin while still carving out her own screen career, so perhaps she wasn't lucky in her own life, since she seemed to have grown up too fast and to have missed the normal life of the child, but we her fans were extremely lucky.  We got to thrill with her as the first girl surfer in GIDGET, and to root for her against her selfish mother in the second version of IMITATION OF LIFE, and to cry a little as she romanced Troy Donahue and ""went all the way"" in the majestically corny A SUMMER PLACE.  And so many other films, good and bad.A few years back she and Troy Donahue made a personal appearance at the Castro Theater here in San Francisco, where she seemed frail, but happy to greet the hordes of fans who poured in from all over the country to thank her for the decades of pleasure her  cinematic legacy has given us.  She even sang a little bit of that ironic song from GREASE that mocked her virginal image, ""Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee!""  She was in fine form that night, and signed autographs and posed for photos until she begged off due to fatigue.IF A MAN ANSWERS may not be one of her best movies, but it shows her considerable comic abilities, and if she was ever happy at all, it might have been during this period when she was often teamed alongside her then-husband, and both seemed to be sitting on top of the world.  Alas, today a little light went out of the world but I know that tonight, I'll look up into the night sky and I'll see a pale new star, directly overhead, with the luminous intensity that was Sandra Dee's alone.",5,Farewell to a great beauty and a lovely lady,1108857600,"02 20, 2005",2005,2036,"['CNN', 'other', 'news', 'networks', 'have', 'announced', 'sad', 'news', 'beloved', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'died', 'morning', '6:00', 'a.m.', 'complications', 'kidney', 'disease', 'pneumonia', 'was', 'son', 'Dodd', 'Darin', 'who', 'made', 'announcement', 'press', 'hours', 'later.For', 'who', 'admired', 'work', 'films', 'sad', 'day', 'indeed', 'was', 'time', 'never', 'saw', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'picture', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'was', 'child', 'model', 'teen', 'star', 'married', 'pop', 'singer', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'still', 'carving', 'out', 'own', 'screen', 'career', 'perhaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'lucky', 'own', 'life', 'seemed', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'too', 'fast', 'have', 'missed', 'normal', 'life', 'child', 'fans', 'were', 'extremely', 'lucky', 'got', 'thrill', 'first', 'girl', 'surfer', 'GIDGET', 'root', 'selfish', 'mother', 'second', 'version', 'IMITATION', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'cry', 'little', 'romanced', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'went', 'way', 'majestically', 'A', 'SUMMER', 'PLACE', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'good', 'bad.A', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'made', 'personal', 'appearance', 'Castro', 'Theater', 'here', 'San', 'Francisco', 'where', 'seemed', 'frail', 'happy', 'greet', 'hordes', 'fans', 'who', 'poured', 'country', 'thank', 'decades', 'pleasure', 'cinematic', 'legacy', 'given', 'even', 'sang', 'little', 'bit', 'ironic', 'song', 'GREASE', 'mocked', 'virginal', 'image', 'Look', ""'m"", 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'was', 'fine', 'form', 'night', 'signed', 'autographs', 'posed', 'photos', 'begged', 'off', 'due', 'fatigue.IF', 'A', 'MAN', 'ANSWERS', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'considerable', 'comic', 'abilities', 'was', 'ever', 'happy', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'period', 'when', 'was', 'often', 'teamed', 'then-husband', 'seemed', 'be', 'sitting', 'top', 'world', 'Alas', 'today', 'little', 'light', 'went', 'world', 'know', 'tonight', ""'ll"", 'look', 'up', 'night', 'sky', ""'ll"", 'see', 'pale', 'new', 'star', 'directly', 'overhead', 'luminous', 'intensity', 'was', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'alone']",N/A

With her illusions of a perfect marriage not quite fulfilled, she enlists some unorthodox help from her mother, ex-showgirl Germaine (Micheline Presle). Step one is to apply directions from a dog-training book. Step two is an imaginary boyfriend Germaine used to use to stir up jealousy that rings her phone but does not speak IF A MAN ANSWERS. Her effort seems to succeed, at least until Eugene brings the made-up man (Cesar Romero) home for dinner. With Germaine's husband now questioning whether the man was actually made up, viewers get the last laugh.Dee is charming and innocent in this role for which she was nominated for Laurel Award as Top Female Comedy Performance in 1963. Cesar Romero was also nominated in Golden Globe Best Supporting Actor the same year. IF A MAN ANSWERS was also nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Motion Picture in the comedy category. No one from the cast or crew took home the actual award.

Unfortunately, I didn't check the back cover before opening it so it can't be returned. I wish websites that sell DVDs would post accurate ratios, Amazon included. For many people, that's a very important detail. With a standard television, this ratio means a large portion of the top and bottom of your screen will be black.

But when I watch a movie on my home television, I'd rather be able to see the actor's faces than the tree on the far left and the car on the far right. If directors don't agree with that, maybe they should only show their films in theatres and not on television or retail DVDs.As for the movie...it's adorable, but probably enjoyed more by women than men.

Not only are they ""beyond imaginable perfect"" in the roles,but their color schemes and character actors, in this case Stefenie Powers and Cesar Romero, are far and away the best of the genre.

The parents, Michele Presle and John Lund, might easily steal the thunder if Darin and Dee didn't play ""to perfection"" with them. The unfocused cinematography is the MAJOR downer. The first five minutes are a total washout and should, frankly, be fast-forwarded. Although the plot stays delicious and  hilarious, too many shots have heads cut off and boring panning sequences.

After she marries him, she tries to use her mother's advice by treating him like a pet, thinking that will make him a more affectionate and attentive husband. It works for a while, until Chantal spills her ""secret"" to her school friend (a young Stefanie Powers), who, just slightly tipsy, lets Eugene in on it, and leaving Chantal to find a different way to get his attention. Again, she turns to her mother for advice for some jealousy tactics. Micheline Presle is a gem as Chantal's mother, while John Lund is perfect as Chantal's protective father. And Cesar Romero is impeccable as Eugene's ""dirty old man"" artist father taking part in one of the schemes. And the cute dogs and the new little ""addition"" to the family . . . . .Dee and Darin were an adorable couple, and this movie confirms it.
