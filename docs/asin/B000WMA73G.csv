THE STORY OF THE 3 CIVIL RIGHTS WORKERS WERE KILLED IN A VICIOUS AND BRUTAL SLAUGHTER. I DO AGREE THAT THE THEIR DEATHS WERE AS VICIOUS AS IT GOT. THE ENDING IS VERY GRAPHIC BUT NECESSARY TO SHOW YOU THE VIOLENCES AND BRUTALITY THAT THESE WORKERS SUFFER IN THE HANDS OF BIGOTRY. I LOVE THE MESSAGE THAT THIS MOVIE HAS TO OFFER WHICH IS REGISTER TO VOTE!!! IF OBAMA BECOMES PRESIDENT REMEMBER THAT HE MADE IT THERE BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE MARTIN LUTHER KING, MALCOLM X, AND THE CIVIL RIGHT WORKERS WHO WANTED CHANGE IN AMERICAN VOTING SYSTEM AS WELL AS CHANGE IN OUR SOCIETY. REMEMBER PEOPLE IN THE STRUGGLE HAVE DIED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE IS COUNTED, BY DISRESPECTING THEM VOTING PROCESS YOU DISRESPECT REASON WHY THESE INDIVIDUALS GAVE UP THEIR LIVES FOR THE CAUSE. I WILL TREASURE THIS MOVIE AND SHOW MY CHILDREN WHY ITS IMPORTANT TO VOTE . THE PERFORMANCES ARE EMMY WINNING. EVERYONE WAS BRILLIANT IN THIS. IT HAS A DEEP AND POWERFUL MESSAGE NOT ONLY ABOUT YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE BUT HOW COLOR SHOULD NOT BE A ISSUE WHEN YOU ARE FRIENDS. THAT BLACK AND WHITE CAN GET ALONG IF YOU DONT JUDGE THE PERSON BY THEIR SKIN BUY THE MOVIES ITS A CLASSIC.",5,MURDER IN MISSISSIPPI IS A CLASSIC MUST HAVE !!

This movie, rather than Mississippi Burning, does the best job treating the murder of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964.  This DVD illustrates the difficulties encountered by those who attempted to register blacks to vote in Mississippi during the racial strife that took place during the 1960s and eventually led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 through the efforts of President Lyndon Johnson.  This movie can be shown in schools to students too young to appreciate what took place during that violent decade.  Mississippi Burning has too much profanity to use in schools, and I believe Murder in Mississippi does a better job of covering this unnecessary tragedy anyway.

The movie is very emotional and well acted, it has pretty shocking racist scenes, and is more acurate to the real facts than Mississipi Burning.For a 1989 tv movie, this one has good quality, but don't expect an all star cast or a bigger budget as Mississipi Burning. Also, Murder in Mississipi doesn't focus on the horrors made by the Ku Klux Klan, it focus more on breaking down the southern Jim Crow Laws in 1964.Overall, Murder in Mississipi is pretty entertaining and educative, but if you are looking for a dark, cruel, graphic and violent racist movie as American History X or Mississipi Burning then this one may not be for you.P.S: The producer of Roots also produced this movie. ;)Adios.",4,Pretty good prequel to Mississipi Burning.,1289606400,"11 13, 2010",2010,904,"['made-for-tv-movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'shocking', 'violent', 'Mississipi', 'Burning', 'struggle', 'theses', '3', 'civil', 'right', 'activists', 'trying', 'persuade', 'black', 'people', 'voting', 'were', 'killed', 'movie', 'very', 'emotional', 'well', 'acted', 'pretty', 'shocking', 'racist', 'scenes', 'more', 'acurate', 'real', 'facts', 'Mississipi', 'Burning.For', '1989', 'tv', 'movie', 'one', 'good', 'quality', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'star', 'cast', 'bigger', 'budget', 'Mississipi', 'Burning', 'Also', 'Murder', 'Mississipi', ""n't"", 'focus', 'horrors', 'made', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'more', 'breaking', 'down', 'southern', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'Laws', '1964.Overall', 'Murder', 'Mississipi', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'educative', 'are', 'looking', 'dark', 'cruel', 'graphic', 'violent', 'racist', 'movie', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'Mississipi', 'Burning', 'then', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'you.P.S', 'producer', 'Roots', 'also', 'produced', 'movie', 'Adios']",N/A

One touch I especially liked was the footage of Herbert Hoover addressing the issue of utilizing the F.B.I. in Mississippi.Civil Rights leaders vilified the F.B.I. for not stepping in to protect the Freedom Summer group.  But that's like criticizing your electrician because he won't fix your plumbing.  The F.B.I., especially in those days, was a purely investigative body, thus the name.  They were NOT a police force and were not trained in police tactics.  Often they were not armed.  They were NOT a security force and had no juridical right to provide security to the civil rights workers.The sad truth was that only the state and local police departments of Mississippi could have protected these people, and, of course, many had little inclination to do so.

When they are in jail, you want them to get to make that ""one"" phone call. When they are being chased by the ""Klan"" members & sheriff/Deputy (whatever he was he was EVIL) down that dark road -you want them to get away to survive another day.I love this movie so much because it gives us a close up, inside look into the lives of these civil rights activists. You get to see what their purpose was. You get to see what they were fighting for. So it takes you on their journey. To the tragic ending.This is a great film that should be shown in every High School & College in the US. So many of these young teenagers & young adults are ignorant to the History of black people, & they should know about this. These 3 young men lost their lives because they believed in EQUAL RIGHTS & OPPORTUNITIES among ""all people"". Not just for the whites. They wanted all people to have the right to VOTE! Barack Obama became our 44th President! That was such a Historical moment. A African American is now President of the US! This film would have been perfect to show HS & college students because it shows them...look how FAR Black People have come. Do you know how many Black people VOTED on that day for Obama...& YES primarily because he is African American. Many voted for the FIRST time (I thought that was ashame, because I am black & I vote any time its time to VOTE).
