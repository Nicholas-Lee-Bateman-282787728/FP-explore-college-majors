784739,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B0000V492O,Craig Connell,"[4, 5]","If you're a fan of film noir, you should like this 1990 takeoff of those 1940s films with Anne Archer as an exaggerated femme-fatale in distress and private detective Tom Berenger paid to spy on her husband.It turns out to be a comedy, however, as Berenger tails the wrong guy but finds things interesting as they are. Then Berenger's girlfriend gets nervous and hires a female detective (Elizabeth Perkins) to spy on him, so everyone is watching everyone!Although there isn't a lot of action, the film never drags and is a good combination of suspense, humor and drama/action. Also nice is the soundtrack, a ""Midnight Run"" sound with good blues guitar and trumpet plus a Leonard Cohen song to start the film. Good colors add to everything.On the negative side, I didn't care for the ending regarding Archer, nor understand why she did what she did. Also, everyone in the film is a bit too sleazy. The other fault likes not in the movie but in the DVD which had a very weak transfer. Overall, fun for a couple of looks.",4,Poking Fun At Film Noir,1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,1019,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'film', 'noir', 'should', 'like', '1990', 'takeoff', '1940s', 'films', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'exaggerated', 'femme-fatale', 'distress', 'private', 'detective', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'paid', 'spy', 'husband.It', 'out', 'be', 'comedy', 'however', 'Berenger', 'wrong', 'guy', 'things', 'interesting', 'are', 'Then', 'Berenger', 'girlfriend', 'nervous', 'female', 'detective', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'spy', 'everyone', 'watching', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'lot', 'action', 'film', 'never', 'drags', 'good', 'combination', 'suspense', 'humor', 'drama/action', 'Also', 'nice', 'soundtrack', 'Midnight', 'Run', 'sound', 'good', 'blues', 'guitar', 'trumpet', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'song', 'start', 'film', 'Good', 'colors', 'add', 'everything.On', 'negative', 'side', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'ending', 'regarding', 'Archer', 'understand', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'Also', 'everyone', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'sleazy', 'other', 'fault', 'likes', 'not', 'movie', 'DVD', 'had', 'very', 'weak', 'transfer', 'Overall', 'fun', 'couple', 'looks']",Love at Large

Smith ""Music Lover""","[2, 3]","If this movie were remade today with Brad Pitt, Matthew McConaughey, or equal star power (take your pick) in the male lead and Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Aniston, or equal star power (take your pick) in the female lead, it would be a smash hit.  Tom Berenger, for all his talents, and despite how good he was in this film, is not heartthrob material, and Elizabeth Perkins, who I like a lot, lacks the sex appeal her role called for, and there was no real chemistry with Berenger.  On the other hand, Anne Archer was perfect, as was Kate Capshaw and Annette O'Toole.  My only other complaint is the pace of the movie was a little too slow, but things picked up nicely at the end.  Still, I enjoyed the movie and felt it was worth the viewing.",3,Better than expected,1296432000,"01 31, 2011",2011,740,"['movie', 'were', 'remade', 'today', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'equal', 'star', 'power', 'take', 'pick', 'male', 'lead', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'equal', 'star', 'power', 'take', 'pick', 'female', 'lead', 'would', 'be', 'smash', 'hit', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'talents', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'film', 'not', 'heartthrob', 'material', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'who', 'like', 'lot', 'sex', 'appeal', 'role', 'called', 'was', 'real', 'chemistry', 'Berenger', 'other', 'hand', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'was', 'perfect', 'was', 'Kate', 'Capshaw', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'only', 'other', 'complaint', 'pace', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'slow', 'things', 'picked', 'up', 'nicely', 'end', 'Still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'worth', 'viewing']",Love at Large
784741,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B0000V492O,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[10, 19]","Notwithstanding the occasional chuckles that pop up now and again in Love at Large, this is not a great movie.  In fact, the filmmaker (writer-director) Alan Rudolph must have sat down and thought, ""Gee, how can I make a movie that people will just love to chomp popcorn to?""So that's what he did.  This is not really a bad movie.  It just ain't very good.  Take a solid cast--Ann Magnuson, Anne Archer, Tom Berenger, Ted Levine, Kate Capshaw, Elizabeth Perkins, and rock god Neil Young--and stick them in a story that is meant to evoke classic film noir but doesn't raise the stakes very high at all for anyone in any situation, and you have the reason for the three stars here.The acting is fine, no problem.  Everyone acquits herself/himself very well indeed.  But the story is just kind of there.  If you're gonna have film noir, ya gotta have some intensity and it just ain't here, folks.  If you DON'T have intensity, you gotta have some real laughs, and there's not enough of em to replace the intensity. So what you DO have is a really watered down film noir that just kind of ambles along good naturedly until the end when it says, Be seein' ya, and then it's over and you can go back to your knitting or whatever.Too bad.  If the story had been punchier OR the laughs had been more frequent and zingier, this coulda been a contender.  For a much better film noir from Alan Rudolph, check out Mortal Thoughts with Demi Moore and Bruce Willis.  This features some of the best performances from both of them, and is a powerful piece of cinema, written by the great William Reilly.Love at Large is a kind of half-hearted homage (three H's in a row, how bout that?) to film noir that never really gets off the ground.

784743,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B0000V492O,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[1, 3]","Was this film on anyone's radar back in 1990? If not, it's easy to see why it's forgotten or never-heard-of. I don't remember if this film was released in theaters or not back in 1990 but it shouldn't have ever been made as far as I'm concerned. I am sure it bombed if it did have a theater release. With such a talented cast you might not expect this film to be great but at least funny. This was a sad attempt to poke fun at days of old cinema crime stories and it fell short at every turn. It wasn't funny at all and most of the characters try too hard to be humorous. The only character that was remotely funny was Miss Dolen played by Anne Archer. Tom Berenger's Harry Dobbs was stereotypical and cliche in the worst ways. Even his name, ""Harry Dobbs"" is cliche of all cliches. Haven't we had enough old-fashioned private eyes named Harry or Dobbs? Just because a film is a parody doesn't mean it has to be a big cliche. Berenger wasn't funny and it actually became painful to watch him trying to be. The writing was ridiculous and the plot unimaginative. I've seen Berenger in comedies before and this was the worst Tom Berenger has ever been. And I am a Tom Berenger fan okay? But even that didn't make this good. Elizabeth Perkins, Kate Capshaw and Annette O'Toole were all wasted in roles that didn't amount to any importance.I get what the film was trying to do but it just didn't cut it. If you want to see hilarious films that poke fun at old-time film noir crime flicks check out, Fatal Instinct with Armand Assante and Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid with Steve Martin. Both are funny and ten times better than this. I think this film would've been funnier if they'd made it into a comedic western. The private investigator parody has been done tons of times before and better.",1,Now I See Why Nobody's Ever Heard of This,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,1785,"['Was', 'film', 'anyone', 'radar', 'back', '1990', 'not', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'forgotten', 'never-heard-of', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'not', 'back', '1990', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'made', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'am', 'sure', 'bombed', 'did', 'have', 'theater', 'release', 'talented', 'cast', 'might', 'not', 'expect', 'film', 'be', 'great', 'least', 'funny', 'was', 'sad', 'attempt', 'poke', 'fun', 'days', 'old', 'cinema', 'crime', 'stories', 'fell', 'short', 'turn', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'most', 'characters', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'humorous', 'only', 'character', 'was', 'remotely', 'funny', 'was', 'Miss', 'Dolen', 'played', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Harry', 'Dobbs', 'was', 'stereotypical', 'cliche', 'worst', 'ways', 'Even', 'name', 'Harry', 'Dobbs', 'cliche', 'cliches', 'Have', ""n't"", 'had', 'enough', 'old-fashioned', 'private', 'eyes', 'named', 'Harry', 'Dobbs', 'Just', 'film', 'parody', ""n't"", 'mean', 'be', 'big', 'cliche', 'Berenger', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'actually', 'became', 'painful', 'watch', 'trying', 'be', 'writing', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'unimaginative', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Berenger', 'comedies', 'was', 'worst', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'ever', 'been', 'am', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'fan', 'okay', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'Kate', 'Capshaw', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'were', 'wasted', 'roles', 'did', ""n't"", 'amount', 'importance.I', 'get', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'cut', 'want', 'see', 'hilarious', 'films', 'poke', 'fun', 'old-time', 'film', 'noir', 'crime', 'flicks', 'check', 'out', 'Fatal', 'Instinct', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'Dead', 'Men', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Wear', 'Plaid', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'are', 'funny', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'think', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'funnier', ""'d"", 'made', 'comedic', 'western', 'private', 'investigator', 'parody', 'been', 'done', 'tons', 'times', 'better']",Love at Large
