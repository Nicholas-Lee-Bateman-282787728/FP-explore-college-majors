1447918,A1WDS3U185610U,B0059XTTW8,Aanel Victoria,"[1, 1]","For folks who have neither read the book nor seen the miniseries, I feel this adaptation failed to spell things out that were immediately clear in the miniseries: things like the central premise (which is Operation Testify, never even named in the film), which was spelled out right away in the miniseries, along with the tinker, tailor code words and their meaning and Jim Prideaux's mission; the meaning of ""Circus""; what/who Karla is; Witchcraft and Merlin; and so on and so forth that would have made the film much more watchable for the novice. And it's not for lack of time that these things aren't spelled out: a lot of meaningless and incongruous new stuff is added in that is not in the book and therefore unnecessary.Yes, the book is mucked about with but it's not all to ill effect: Tom Hardy gives a delicious performance and is disarmingly likeable as Ricky Tarr. Unfortunately, the time spent here on Tarr is taken away from getting to know the four suspects, and even the mole doesn't get enough airtime, unlike in the miniseries, where everyone is explored. I also missed seeing much of the Peter Gwillem character, who is quite yummy in the miniseries and has a lot of screentime therein, but Benedict Cumberbatch as Gwillem here is hardly seen, plus there's a homosexual plotline tagged onto him that is needless but not entirely out of place.I'm of two or three minds about Gary Oldman as Smiley. Oldman's leathery expressionless face hardly moves, especially not behind those immense glasses which he does not remove even when swimming. So even though Oldman gives a presumably authentic reading of the character, he's much less expressive than Alec Guinness -- who though more cheerful and perhaps less stolid than LeCarre wrote him, is often more appealing to watch because his face actually moves and his eyes twinkle.All in all, I'd say this movie has merit on its own, and is certainly worth watching. I think it could be a bit of a puzzle for newcomers, especially if they do not pay attention, but some folks love being puzzled like that so this can work for some people. Do check it out if you have the inclination -- for instance, it's just $3.99 to ""rent"" it for a 48-hour viewing on Amazon Instant. That's how I watched it and it was totally worth it. It's worth it even if you are just the least bit curious and/or want to compare it to the book or miniseries.",3,"Not enough spelled out, too much changed.",1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,2392,"['folks', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'miniseries', 'feel', 'adaptation', 'failed', 'spell', 'things', 'out', 'were', 'immediately', 'clear', 'miniseries', 'things', 'central', 'premise', 'Operation', 'Testify', 'never', 'even', 'named', 'film', 'was', 'spelled', 'out', 'right', 'away', 'miniseries', 'tinker', 'tailor', 'code', 'words', 'meaning', 'Jim', 'Prideaux', 'mission', 'meaning', 'Circus', 'Karla', 'Witchcraft', 'Merlin', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'watchable', 'novice', 'not', 'lack', 'time', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'spelled', 'out', 'lot', 'meaningless', 'incongruous', 'new', 'stuff', 'added', 'not', 'book', 'therefore', 'unnecessary.Yes', 'book', 'mucked', 'not', 'ill', 'effect', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'delicious', 'performance', 'disarmingly', 'likeable', 'Ricky', 'Tarr', 'Unfortunately', 'time', 'spent', 'here', 'Tarr', 'taken', 'away', 'getting', 'know', 'four', 'suspects', 'even', 'mole', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'airtime', 'miniseries', 'where', 'everyone', 'explored', 'also', 'missed', 'seeing', 'much', 'Peter', 'Gwillem', 'character', 'who', 'quite', 'yummy', 'miniseries', 'lot', 'screentime', 'therein', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Gwillem', 'here', 'hardly', 'seen', 'homosexual', 'plotline', 'tagged', 'needless', 'not', 'entirely', 'place.I', ""'m"", 'two', 'three', 'minds', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Smiley', 'Oldman', 'leathery', 'expressionless', 'face', 'hardly', 'especially', 'not', 'immense', 'glasses', 'not', 'remove', 'even', 'when', 'swimming', 'So', 'even', 'Oldman', 'presumably', 'authentic', 'reading', 'character', 'much', 'less', 'expressive', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'who', 'more', 'cheerful', 'perhaps', 'less', 'stolid', 'LeCarre', 'wrote', 'often', 'more', 'appealing', 'watch', 'face', 'actually', 'moves', 'eyes', 'twinkle.All', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'merit', 'own', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'bit', 'puzzle', 'newcomers', 'especially', 'do', 'not', 'pay', 'attention', 'folks', 'love', 'being', 'puzzled', 'so', 'can', 'work', 'people', 'Do', 'check', 'out', 'have', 'inclination', 'instance', 'just', '3.99', 'rent', '48-hour', 'viewing', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'how', 'watched', 'was', 'totally', 'worth', 'even', 'are', 'just', 'least', 'bit', 'curious', 'and/or', 'want', 'compare', 'book', 'miniseries']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

Nor was the description of Ricky Tarrs' experiences well explicated.

A man will be sent to Hungary to meet a General who has the name of a double agent in Britain. There is a meeting, but it is a trap! Later there is a meeting in Britain. Then we see various locations and actions. A man walks to his home. The Treasury questions their budget items and their efficiency. We see other people at other scenes. ""There's a mole in the Circus."" Smiley is retired now but will take the job. We see a scene from the past. ""Operation Witchcraft."" Their leader is temperamental. Smiley will check the names of the recently retired. There is talk about trading access to secrets. [The talk seems pointless, as if something is missing.] Then we see an office party. There is a scene in a boy's school.Next we are in Budapest again. A woman offers a secret as trade for her defection: a double agent. But she is put on a ship and disappears! Can he get her out? We see how telephone conversations are monitored by a government agency. Peter looks for a ledger. We see him borrow a ledger. Percy questions him. Back at George's place he attacks Ricky Tarr! George talks about a meeting in 1955. A fanatic always has a secret doubt, says George. They have an unusual Santa Claus for their Christmas party. We see more about that incident in Hungary. [The film continues to drag on.] Scenes keep repeating, like padding. There is a confrontation on an airfield. ""I am loyal!"" They get an address. Next we see Paris. There is a meting, then they leave. George waits in the dark. Are these scenes confusing? A sniper shoots a man.

Where the book moved at the rate one associates with planet formation in the solar system, the movie manages to speed things up.  That is, ever so slightly.While the movie goes it's own way in rejecting much back-story, the editing mimics a degree of the time shifting style of the book.  Yet transitions are poorly placed and you wonder if you merely fell asleep and missed a bit, which is possible, than witnessed brilliant editing.  The story simply isn't all that engrossing.  Smiley is brought in and assembles a team to look for a mole in the ""circus.""Thats about it.  Few surprises and the plot, while edgy in the 1970s, now has been done over a few times even by reality in the form of Aldrich Ames.  The cloak and dagger bits are few and far between, though action is appropriately brutal and well timed.  The second half is far better than the first.Performance wise, the cast is peerless.  To name a few, Firth, Hardy, Oldman and Mr Holmes himself, Benedict Cumberbatch give every ounce of credibilty you need for serious jobs like this.  Yet, there's still something missing.  While this takes a vote above disappointments like Breach or The Good Shepherd, Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy feels like a dusty old overcoat.

Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy has a great screenplay, score, and what I consider to be Gary Oldman's finest performance to date.

I just don't bother with those type of movies anymore unless action is truly integral to a good story. I knew going in that this was not a action flick and I had an idea of the gist of the plot.....and was looking forward to a good spy story but I didn't get it.This movie is loaded with talent but for myself it failed because 1) it was confusing/difficult to follow, and 2) there is NO character development. I got to the point where at times when I seemed to be a bit lost trying to figure out who's the good or bad guy, then after an hour or more I just didn't care one way or the other. Again, great actors, great photography, and a cerebral plot - a combo which should have produced a memorable 2 hour film. At the very end I simply could care less who was the mole, or why, and I was just happy it finally ended. During the movie I said to myself, perhaps this is the type of movie that needs to be watched twice to fully appreciate the nuances. However, when I left the theatre I simply said to myself, that that was a few hours of my life I won't be getting back. Sad, because I am a huge movie fan but in the past 10 years I have had to carefully pick and choose from the fluff that hollywood turns out. I am a huge fan of TCM which shows all the classic movies from the 20's to the 60's and I do love a good cold war flick.I have scoured reviews for this movie and found that most seemingly intelligent reviewers fell into either the, Loved It, or Waste of Time, category with few in between. For my rating I was trying to be fair and objective but sadly I can only give it 2 stars - I was going to give it 3 but I just can't, I didn't enjoy it, and didn't care about any of the characters one way or the other.

1447934,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B0059XTTW8,Andres C. Salama,"[3, 10]","I read ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" some twenty years ago. I don't recall all the details of the book, but I remember it being a beguiling novel (though I think that John Le Carre has written better books, like for instance, its sequel ""The Honourable Schoolboy""). The book is basically about taciturn spy George Smiley being brought back from retirement in order to catch a mole set by his Soviet nemesis, Karla, in the Circus (an alter ego for MI6, the British Intelligence Service). Now comes a film version of the novel, that roughly respects the plot (in 1979, there was a miniseries about the book, starring Alec Guiness as Smiley, which I haven't seen). The recreation of the era (the early 1970s) is fine, but this is one of the few positive things that I can say about this movie.First, in this movie, Smiley is performed by Gary Oldman, almost unrecognizable under loads of old age makeup (wouldn't it have made more sense to hire an older actor to play Smiley?).Second, the movie is at times dull and boring and its tone is ridiculously somber.Third, almost all the actors here perform languidly, as if they were making a parody of a British gentleman. Now, the cast includes many famous British actors (aside Oldman, we have Colin Firth, John Hurt, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, and many others that are lesser known). These actors are usually fine performers in other movies, so clearly the filmmakers are at fault here.Fourth, the plot is virtually impossible to follow if you haven't read the book (understandably so, considering six hours of the miniseries have been compressed to two hours).Worst of all, the climactic scene when the mole is finally caught (for obvious reasons, I'm not going to say who he is) is, well, totally anticlimactic, to the point where the audience might felt cheated, after all the previous buildup (by the way, it is interesting to see that when the traitor is find, he is initially treated with kids gloves, as if never forgetting that while he might be a Soviet spy, he hasn't stopped being a gentleman. So, in a way, this movie suggests that postwar Britain might have not been very well suited to the ruthless game of international espionage).So, summing up, a great disappointment, a movie that despite high expectations and high critical acclaim has in my opinion little to recommend for it.",2,Disappointing,1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,2341,"['read', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'details', 'book', 'remember', 'being', 'beguiling', 'novel', 'think', 'John', 'Le', 'Carre', 'written', 'better', 'books', 'instance', 'sequel', 'Honourable', 'Schoolboy', 'book', 'basically', 'taciturn', 'spy', 'George', 'Smiley', 'being', 'brought', 'back', 'retirement', 'order', 'catch', 'mole', 'set', 'Soviet', 'nemesis', 'Karla', 'Circus', 'alter', 'ego', 'MI6', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'Service', 'Now', 'film', 'version', 'novel', 'roughly', 'plot', '1979', 'was', 'miniseries', 'book', 'starring', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'Smiley', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'recreation', 'era', 'early', '1970s', 'fine', 'one', 'few', 'positive', 'things', 'can', 'say', 'movie.First', 'movie', 'Smiley', 'performed', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'loads', 'old', 'age', 'makeup', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'hire', 'older', 'actor', 'play', 'Smiley', '.Second', 'movie', 'times', 'dull', 'boring', 'tone', 'ridiculously', 'somber.Third', 'almost', 'actors', 'here', 'perform', 'languidly', 'were', 'making', 'parody', 'British', 'gentleman', 'Now', 'cast', 'many', 'famous', 'British', 'actors', 'aside', 'Oldman', 'have', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'lesser', 'known', 'actors', 'are', 'usually', 'fine', 'performers', 'other', 'movies', 'so', 'clearly', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'fault', 'here.Fourth', 'plot', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'follow', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'understandably', 'so', 'considering', 'six', 'hours', 'miniseries', 'have', 'been', 'compressed', 'two', 'hours', '.Worst', 'climactic', 'scene', 'when', 'mole', 'finally', 'caught', 'obvious', 'reasons', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'who', 'well', 'totally', 'anticlimactic', 'point', 'where', 'audience', 'might', 'felt', 'cheated', 'previous', 'buildup', 'way', 'interesting', 'see', 'when', 'traitor', 'find', 'initially', 'treated', 'kids', 'gloves', 'never', 'forgetting', 'might', 'be', 'Soviet', 'spy', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'being', 'gentleman', 'So', 'way', 'movie', 'postwar', 'Britain', 'might', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'very', 'well', 'suited', 'ruthless', 'game', 'international', 'espionage', '.So', 'summing', 'up', 'great', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'high', 'expectations', 'high', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'opinion', 'little', 'recommend']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

Thomas,"[2, 3]","Let me preface this review with the caveat that I have not read John le Carre's novel but I have seen and rather enjoyed the classic BBC television adaptation of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" starring Alec Guinness as George Smiley.It should go without saying that this post-millennial theatrical adaptation is a different animal. Directed by Tomas Alfredson, whose previous feature ""Let the Right One In"" was rightly heralded as an instant classic, has produced with the considerable aid of his screenwriters Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan an extremely stylish, precise, and condensed version of the story. The plot, layered not only in events and characterizations but also in themes, is complicated but not impenetrable; new information is constantly revealed to the audience as the film unfolds, which makes complaints that this film is ""boring"" all the more baffling to this reviewer. Attentive viewers should have no trouble following the film.Cold War paranoia infests every frame. Every detail of the film feels calibrated, from the angles of shots to the drab colors of the sets to the postures of the actors, each of whom is superb in their roles: Gary Oldman portrays a quieter, more detached Smiley than Guinness, Mark Strong personifies the sadness of Jim Prideaux, and Tom Hardy makes a surprisingly vulnerable Ricky Tarr.If I were to boil down the key difference between this film and the earlier BBC version (other than, of course, the length of time in which to tell the story), I would have to say atmosphere. Both are extremely well-crafted, well-written, and well-acted, but it was only in this film version where I could palpably feel the tension of the scenario.This Blu-ray features a fine, film-like transfer. Extra features are not overly abundant, consisting of an audio commentary from Alfredson and Oldman, a couple of deleted scenes, and filmmaker interviews. The most interesting extra for me personally was the interview with le Carre himself where the author discusses his background and delves much deeper than the usual fluff piece.The story of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is an espionage classic, and this latest film adaptation is a fine example of the genre and worthy of standing alongside the BBC version and other classics in the fold.

MI6 included.A woeful screenplay and limp direction conspired to deal a heavy blow to what was the most powerful novel of its genre.I, for one, had been terribly excited at the prospect of seeing Smiley brought to life on the big screen again. What puzzled me, however, was how Tinker Tailor could have been diluted to just two or so cinematic hours. I need not have worried; the attempt was a dismal failure and most likely was always going to be.But, in the hands of this director what we did get lacked substance with what appeared to be a hurry-along to explain as much of the convoluted plot in the smallest amount of time possible.This inevitably led to some odd and quite unrealistic scenes. The strength of both the book and the mini-series was that the reader/viewer could not possibly question what it was that Le Carre wanted us to believe. Not unless one had been a secret agent of course.More surprising was the utter dilution of Karla. It may, or may not, be integral for the audience not to understand how mysterious and shadowy a figure Le Carre intended him to be. However, his presence in Budapest diluted and undermined very much the psychology of both Smiley and his Russian opponent. A bridge built, perhaps, for Part Three?At the risk of seeming to be too picky, Ricky Tar's call to Lacon which ultimately kick-starts the whole kerfuffle is artistic licence gone completely balmy.

1447948,A20IIR0422G3A5,B0059XTTW8,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 1]","It is inevitable that this movie would be compared to the phenomenally well received 1980 version starring Alec Guinness as George Smiley. It does not make the grade on several points. It might be worth mentioning its successes first.Since this was made 35 years after the book was written, and perhaps 45 years after the period it describes, yet it was filmed in contemporary London, it was a challenge to evoke the early post-Cold War period. The design, camera, and music crafts accomplish this by giving the whole look and feel a ""film noir"" atmosphere, often in shadows. That worked; however it tended to exacerbate some of the film's problems. Gary Oldman was first rate, in an incredibly low key way. I would bet that he studied Guinness' acting in the part and tried to mimic that effect. One thing which helped is that Oldman is closer to the age of Le Carre's character as written in the novel, which works better with the scene with former Circus head of research Connie Sachs. John Hurt did well in the brief role of ""Control"", playing it with a lot more feeling than Alexander Knox in the TV series. Like all other characters, Benedict Cumberbatch's role is short and poorly filmed, but it comes off more believable than Michael Jayston's performance as Smiley's colleague, Peter Guillam.The biggest single negative mark compared to the TV series is that we are given no time to get to know these characters, especially since many are played by unfamiliar faces. The only actors I recognized aside from the three above are Colin Firth as Bill Hayden and Ciaran Hinds as Roy Bland. And for as good as both of those are, there was precious little time seeing them on screen to get a read on their personalities. In the TV series, you could instantly get a sense of their personalities in a delightful early slowly played scene. Part of the problem may be that there are precious few close-ups of characters' facial reactions. Half the time, it seems the camera is too far off to catch the good stuff. This is made worse by the darkness of most scenes.It is understandable that many scenes would be cut or abbreviated or presented in a different way, but the ""abbreviation"" seems choppy. Both this version and the TV version were true to Le Carre's plot style with multiple flashbacks. Whenever I get a far better understanding of a film on second viewing, I sense that far too much was left on the cutting room floor. When I started watching it for the first time, I felt so disjointed, that I stopped and watched the TV series again, so I could get a better handle on the plot and characters.My biggest feeling of loss was the fact that we get little good sense of major characters, and virtually no good sense of lesser characters. From the 41 roles in the TV series, characters with several major scenes are cut entirely, such as the delightful scene with Joss Ackland as Jerry Westerby and Sian Phillips as Smiley's wife, Ann. Treatment of some minor characters seems to be an afterthought, instead of the depth given in the TV version. Hopefully, without giving anything away, I think both the climax and the denouement were let downs.I think that if I had not seen the Alec Guinness version, I may have liked this better, but that's the name of the game when one evaluates artistic works.

First, Gary Oldman is arguably one of the finest actors of his generation, but I could not help but find fault with his portrayal of George Smiley when compared with Alec Guiness.  I think this is mostly a function of the compression forced upon the story by the movie's abbreviated length, but somehow his gray, thinning hair was not enough to convince me of his long and distinguished career in intelligence.  Oldman's take on Smiley is appropriately worn down by time and the failures he has endured professionally and personally, but to the point that his more successful past is not much in evidence.This brings me to the related problem that the suspects, who are the most senior officials in the agency, are not really identified functionally.  What do they do?  That omission, along with nearly any other way to connect with them as individuals means that some very fine actors are basically left with nothing to do.  (Toby Jones as Percy Alleline is an exception, but he comes across as almost a cartoon figure who is hard to imagine in such a senior position.) Ciaran Hinds as Roy Bland hardly registers; even Colin Firth as Bill Haydon is largely wasted.  Since the movie is all about identifying the mole from within their ranks, the core of the mystery feels kind of empty.  Far more time is spent on the stories of Jim Prideaux and Ricki Tarr, who are secondary characters. In the end, even the motives of the mole, when he is revealed, are touched only briefly.Director Tomas Alfredson chose to treat Smiley's wife Ann as a distant problem, never quite seen, and this was a decision that I don't really understand.  There are repeated flashbacks to an agency end-of-year party that were simply distracting.The good news:  the high points of the plot are all there.

1447959,ACJVGDN8G386P,B0059XTTW8,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[5, 7]","The idealized world of spy adventure which is the trademark of the James Bond books and films really has nothing to do with foreign intelligence. Unlike Ian Fleming (who wrote the James Bond novels), John Le Carre's vision of the world of spies came directly from first-hand experience. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Le Carre worked for British Intelligence and the British Foreign Service, taking part in wire taps, break-ins, and defector interrogations. This is a world of shadowed corners, darkened rooms, uncomfortable headsets, and endless transcriptions, not ski resorts and casino hotels.Gary Oldman offers the performance of his career as the older intelligence genius, George Smiley, assigned to find the ""mole"" inside a branch of British Intelligence code-named ""the Circus"". A mole is a double-agent, someone pretending to be on one side but in fact working for the other who has burrowed himself inside the upper-reaches of the organization, allowing for easy access to classified information which can be leaked to the other side. When a younger agent, Jim Prideaux, is sent on a mission to Budapest to meet with a general supposedly defecting to the west, it becomes obvious the other side knew almost immediately about the meeting. The meeting point is at a caf&eacute; which turns deadly when even before the meeting has begun, he is shot at. In other words, someone in British Intelligence had informed the other side of the meeting. Also, a another young low-level agent goes to the east and befriends a young woman looking to defect who claims she has knowledge about an intelligence mole.Smiley goes on a kind of murder-mystery-like investigation to determine why the Budapest meeting became a fiasco and simultaneously uncover the identity of the mole. Each of the witnesses give their understanding of the story, how they are involved, and how each story fits into a larger mosaic of intrigue and betrayal. Part of the trick to navigating this film is understanding when flashbacks are occurring and when the film is in the present moment. The top suspects are all high-ranking British Intelligence agents, and given code names: Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Poor Man. When he identifies the perpetrator, instead of indicating them by name, Smiley will simply offer the code name.An outstanding, if darkly atmospheric film which is a much more realistic portrayal of the shrouded world of foreign espionage. Some younger viewers may be frustrated because of the lack of action and the less than straight-forward linear progression. Each piece of the puzzle takes time to come to the fore. This film is more of a subtler suspense thriller rather than an action movie. Early on, many incidences are revealed without explanation at first. But if you can be patient, the film really starts to kick in at about the 30 to 45 min mark.What we really learn is that the world of spies is ultimately about secrets. Who has them, who doesn't, and who doesn't want which secret to be revealed to whom. And all of the participants are haggard, spent people, not the glamorous icons portrayed in Hollywood spy thrillers. The skis, cocktails, waitresses, and roulette tables are strangely absent. Dim halls, unkempt studies, and damp cells are where these people reside.",5,The Spent and Dark World of Spies as only Le Carre Can Tell It--007 Could Never Conceive It,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,3280,"['idealized', 'world', 'spy', 'adventure', 'trademark', 'James', 'Bond', 'books', 'films', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'foreign', 'intelligence', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'who', 'wrote', 'James', 'Bond', 'novels', 'John', 'Le', 'Carre', 'vision', 'world', 'spies', 'came', 'directly', 'first-hand', 'experience', 'late', '1950', 'early', '1960', 'Le', 'Carre', 'worked', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'British', 'Foreign', 'Service', 'taking', 'part', 'wire', 'taps', 'break-ins', 'defector', 'interrogations', 'world', 'shadowed', 'corners', 'darkened', 'rooms', 'uncomfortable', 'headsets', 'endless', 'transcriptions', 'not', 'ski', 'resorts', 'casino', 'hotels.Gary', 'Oldman', 'performance', 'career', 'older', 'intelligence', 'genius', 'George', 'Smiley', 'assigned', 'find', 'mole', 'branch', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'code-named', 'Circus', 'mole', 'double-agent', 'someone', 'pretending', 'be', 'one', 'side', 'fact', 'working', 'other', 'who', 'burrowed', 'upper-reaches', 'organization', 'allowing', 'easy', 'access', 'classified', 'information', 'can', 'be', 'leaked', 'other', 'side', 'When', 'younger', 'agent', 'Jim', 'Prideaux', 'sent', 'mission', 'Budapest', 'meet', 'general', 'supposedly', 'defecting', 'west', 'obvious', 'other', 'side', 'knew', 'almost', 'immediately', 'meeting', 'meeting', 'point', 'caf', 'eacute', 'deadly', 'when', 'even', 'meeting', 'begun', 'shot', 'other', 'words', 'someone', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'had', 'informed', 'other', 'side', 'meeting', 'Also', 'young', 'low-level', 'agent', 'east', 'young', 'woman', 'looking', 'defect', 'who', 'knowledge', 'intelligence', 'mole.Smiley', 'kind', 'murder-mystery-like', 'investigation', 'determine', 'why', 'Budapest', 'meeting', 'became', 'fiasco', 'simultaneously', 'identity', 'mole', 'witnesses', 'give', 'understanding', 'story', 'how', 'are', 'involved', 'how', 'story', 'larger', 'mosaic', 'intrigue', 'betrayal', 'Part', 'trick', 'navigating', 'film', 'understanding', 'when', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'occurring', 'when', 'film', 'present', 'moment', 'top', 'suspects', 'are', 'high-ranking', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'agents', 'given', 'code', 'names', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Poor', 'Man', 'When', 'perpetrator', 'instead', 'indicating', 'name', 'Smiley', 'will', 'simply', 'offer', 'code', 'outstanding', 'darkly', 'atmospheric', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'shrouded', 'world', 'foreign', 'espionage', 'younger', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'frustrated', 'lack', 'action', 'less', 'straight-forward', 'linear', 'progression', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'time', 'come', 'fore', 'film', 'more', 'subtler', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'rather', 'action', 'movie', 'Early', 'many', 'incidences', 'are', 'revealed', 'explanation', 'first', 'can', 'be', 'patient', 'film', 'really', 'kick', '30', '45', 'min', 'really', 'learn', 'world', 'spies', 'ultimately', 'secrets', 'Who', 'who', ""n't"", 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'secret', 'be', 'revealed', 'whom', 'participants', 'are', 'haggard', 'spent', 'people', 'not', 'glamorous', 'icons', 'portrayed', 'Hollywood', 'spy', 'thrillers', 'skis', 'cocktails', 'waitresses', 'roulette', 'tables', 'are', 'strangely', 'absent', 'Dim', 'halls', 'unkempt', 'studies', 'damp', 'cells', 'are', 'where', 'people', 'reside']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

If James Bond or Jason Bourne with their uncanny physical ability, daredevil stunts, technical gadgetry, and ability to make love to the most beautiful women inside of 3 minutes while riding a horse backwards making thousand yard head shots is your idea of the quintessential spy, then I'm not sure you're ready to be humbled by George Smiley.  The greatest antithesis to the stereoptypical international man of mystery is a middle aged man whose greatest weapon is his noggin.Thomas Alfredson (Let The Right One In) has the latest pleasure of adapting a John Le Carre novel and takes on the heavily layered onion that is ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.""  The first thing you have to embrace is that this is a piece, while having quite a fantastic situation being resolved, is more akin to how real spy-work looks and takes place.  There really is an all-star cast here headed by Gary Oldman but also starring Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hardy, Mark Strong and a few more familiar faces and they deliver.  I thought this piece had an awesome feel to the era, it was like a time machine, and that gave it great authenticity.  Like in true espionage what is required in order to appreciate this film is patience and a willingness to be able to follow the characters, who they are, and what they are up to.  If you appreciate a cerebral mystery/thriller and can keep the ADHD at bay you might just enjoy one of the best Spy movies ever. YES ever...  I've seen this movie a half-dozen times or so, that's really how much I enjoy the film.The movie takes place in 70's England and we are following the British Intelligence Bureau and their Counter-Intelligence division codenamed ""The Circus.""  George Smiley (Gary Oldman) begins the movie as ""Control's"" (Codename of the head of CI) right hand man and we quickly see him and ""Control"" fired from the Circus bc of recent deficiencies they've had in the field.  This leaves Bill Haydon (Colin Firth) Percy Alleline (New head of CI) Roy Bland, and Toby Estehasse heading up ""The Circus.""  Smiley is like a fish out of water in retirement, especially considering the love of his life, his wife, keeps more things on the sidelines than Alabama Football and Control has recently passed away.  This is where your patience is required in the early stages, then an agent, Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy) returns home under suspicious circumstances and contacts a parliament member who oversees intellligence and makes a wild claim.  Smiley is then contacted by the Member and after a meeting in which he is told that there is a dreaded KGB mole in the counter intelligence unit, the Member admits that Control had brought this to his attention before but that he thought he had gone mad. The game is now a foot and George Smiley begins his operation with the help of one outside retired police officer and Peter Guillim (Cumberbatch), long time friend and Tarr's boss.  After Smiley visits an analyst forced out for asking the wrong questions and Controls apartment and see's that Control had 5 candidates for the mole he meets Tarr to gauge the veracity of his story and his claims. Realizing that Karla's (KGB Chief Codename) mole is a high level member of counter intelligence, he sends Guillim into the Circus to spy for him and we are greeted with some tension provided by Cumberbatch.  By this time Smiley is in full gear and emotions are running high, not for Smiley who is always even Steven, and as Smiley knocks down domino after domino he gets the piece that he needs in tracking down the agent (Mark Strong) who returned home from the op that was blown the previous year that was justification for his letting go.  Smiley sets the bait at the end of the movie to see which rat will crawl onto the trap and hopefully resurrect his career and good name.This movie has close to zero action in it and is a thinking man's movie, that being said it is based on an extremely famous work by author John Le Carre who was himself a spy for British Intelligence.  I thought that Alfredson and the cast did a bang up job on this whole gig and thank them for bringing this book to modern day cinema.  This movie is smart without being pretentious and it's serious without being over-dramatic. Alfedson is all business in his duties directing the characters and that is the way it should be in this movie.  In a world full of Jason Bournes and James Bonds a dash of George Smiley is a long time coming and I hope not too far off in the near future.  Considering this was part of a trilogy before it was cool to do trilogies it would be nice to see Oldman resurrect his role along with Cumberbatch.",5,A Cerebral look at counter-intelligence...

No fiery blasts, no gruesome close-ups, no half-baked actor-heroes running around in tights as insects or small mammals. No, just a literate and complex script, a story told deliberately but not slowly which captures and keeps our attention, and actors who are so good they can say one thing, mean another, and who knows which is which. Because this is a John LeCarre spy story, there's no glamour, just betrayal and a ruthlessness which is fascinating and repellent, by both sides.Control (John Hurt), head of the Circus, Britain's spy agency, is convinced there is a Soviet mole among his top subordinates. He sends an agent to Hungary to discover who. The agent is betrayed and shot. In the scandal that follows, Control is forced to retire and with him his most trusted subordinate, George Smiley (Gary Oldman). Suddenly the Circus is running it's own mole, gaining valuable secrets from a Soviet official based London. Is the information solid? Can it be used to get back in the good graces of the CIA? Could there really be a mole in the Circus? Maybe, say a mandarin or two in Whitehall, Control, now dead, might have been right.Up to now we've been the fly on the wall. We're not surprised when George Smiley is secretly asked to investigate his former colleagues and replies, ""I'm retired."" We're not surprised, either, when Smiley shortly after agrees. What might surprise us is the amount of tension, occasional violence and even sadness that George Smiley stirs up, most often deliberately.Smiley is a grey man. His feelings are hidden. He's been cuckolded by one of his former colleagues. He doesn't say much; he sees much; and his mind is logical and devious. Gary Oldman gives one his best performances. Neither he nor Smiley gives much away, but look at how Oldman can use a slight twitch of his lip, a movement of his hand, a slight movement of his eyelid. When, halfway through the movie, we realize how ruthless a sincere-seeming George Smiley can be, the moment brings satisfaction as well as the creeps. It's all Oldman.Those George Smiley is prying out from their possible foreign home all are equal to the task of playing against Oldman. There is Toby Jones as Percy Alleline, David Dencik as Toby Esterhase, Colin Firth as Bill Haydon and Ciaran Hinds as Roy Bland. John Hurt as Control with his exhausted face full of wrinkles and bags makes a strong impression. In fact, there's not a dull or misplaced actor in the movie.The screenwriters, Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan, and the director, Tomas Alfredson (a Swede who gave us Let the Right One In), have carried off something that seems to elude most mainstream Hollywood writers and directors. The movie is complex but still clear enough if you pay close attention. They assume the audience is literate and intelligent. They take their time when needed, but they assume you will stay with them. If you've never seen a photo of the Hagia Sophia in the middle of old Istanbul you may not realize the story has shifted locations. You will in just a few moments. If you did get the visual placemark, you'll feel like patting yourself on the back...you've just been treated as a grownup.Do all the subtle stratagems and clues become clear as we move along? I think so...but I'm not absolutely sure. I've read the book and watched with delight the television version with Alec Guinness. I knew whodunit while he was doing it.

I don&#8217;t understand the need to remake it but I don&#8217;t get the passion the brits had for the series when it came out. I watched a couple of episodes from the original and to be honest I found it a bit boring. I&#8217;ve also tried reading John Le Carre novels years ago and found it tedious and slow.The story is about the old spy days of the Cold War and the game between the brits and the russians. Apparently there is a mole among the brits top tier and no one believes them. George Smiley was forced into retirement when his old boss Control was forced out after a mistake. The mistake had to do with an agent getting injured when he was sent to Russia to find out who the mole was. There&#8217;s four likely suspects and they all seem plausible. No one can be trusted but Smiley because he was retired. In the end it turns out to be his wife&#8217;s old lover. I kind of knew it was going to be him since Colin Firth played that role. You figure since all the other guys were no names they wouldn&#8217;t give such a juicy role to one of them. That&#8217;s a problem with modern movies, meaty roles go to the big names.

This is a good film with admirable qualities, and one drawback that nonetheless prevents it from achieving the greatness for which it strives.In short: this is a densely plotted, methodical, deliberately paced film that is also highly atmospheric and very well acted.  At the same time, the film isn't always easy to follow and might have done with an additional scene or two of exposition. There are numerous characters in this movie, with numerous motives and motives within motives, and at a mere two hours all of this can get a bit overwhelming.

The cinematography, costumes, and art decoration are equally strong: this story looks like a story set in the Seventies should look).  There is intelligence here.

1447967,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0059XTTW8,C. Sawin,"[17, 24]","There was much to be excited about when it came to Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. It may have been a remake, but it also featured the likes of Gary Oldman, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, and Mark Strong in a spy movie. Odds are that you're a fan of one of those actors and who doesn't love a film about spies? Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy are what initially attracted me to the project and Mark Strong was just a pleasant surprise, so the anticipation was very high. Unfortunately, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is basically a waste of two hours.A press screening for this was held nearly three weeks before the film's limited release date. Everyone who attended was handed what was referred to as a ""cheat sheet,"" which not only helped describe the film but also went into detail about ""The Circus"" along with definitions of code names and terms that were used throughout the film. This is being mentioned because unless you've read the book, have seen the original 1979 film, or receive this ""cheat sheet"" and go over it in great detail then you will more than likely be lost throughout most of the film. Five years ago, Donnie Darko director Richard Kelly released a film called Southland Tales. The unusual thing about it was that the movie was actually episodes 4-6 while a prequel graphic novel contained episodes 1-3. It's an interesting approach that deserves credit for trying something different, but the bottom line is that most people won't and don't read up on a film before it's released.With that said, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy isn't completely incomprehensible. You still know what's going on, but you just don't care. It's a very slow moving film that relies on dialogue more than anything to tell the story. Its nonlinear sense of storytelling isn't a smooth transition and is a bit difficult to keep track of at times. Didn't this character die earlier? Wasn't he working for somebody else like five minutes ago? Wait wait wait...WHAT? Who the HELL is that guy? These are the types of questions you'll probably be asking yourself. The majority of the characters seem very similar to one another and even share similar hairstyles. So everyone basically comes off as old, bitter people working for the government that are paranoid about a mole and probably should have retired ten years ago, which is kind of odd since the film revolves around retired agents attempting to be pulled back into the service.Gary Oldman puts in a fascinating performance as George Smiley, but it fails in comparison to most of the other film characters he's known for. Smiley doesn't even speak for a good while (Oldman is probably shown on screen for at least a good ten to fifteen minutes before he actually says anything) and the fact that Oldman went through such precise detail just to pick out the appropriate pair of glasses for the character is admirable. He has one magnificent scene in the film, which occurs in his office with Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch) as he tells the story of how Karla never returned his engraved lighter. It's easily the best scene in the film. Tom Hardy is also fairly fantastic in his role as he shows quite a bit of emotion in the film and Mark Strong offers the type of solid performance you'd expect from the English actor.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy does have a few redeeming qualities that mostly lie within the performances of Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy. Its decorative setting and use of unique perspective automatically makes the film appealing to the eye. The film is really bland the majority of the time though and is extremely uneventful. Even when something violent does occur, it fades into obscurity rather quickly and is covered up by the gargantuan amounts of jargon that's constantly regurgitated amongst everyone on-screen. So despite a few semi-decent performances and an experience that's at least visually intriguing, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a thriller that never really gets thrilling. Your constant uphill battle to stay awake until the film ends is far more exhilarating.",2,Eloquently acted yet extremely slow paced,1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,4020,"['was', 'much', 'be', 'excited', 'when', 'came', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'remake', 'also', 'featured', 'likes', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'spy', 'movie', 'Odds', 'are', ""'re"", 'fan', 'one', 'actors', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'film', 'spies', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'are', 'what', 'initially', 'attracted', 'project', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'was', 'just', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'anticipation', 'was', 'very', 'high', 'Unfortunately', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'basically', 'waste', 'two', 'hours.A', 'press', 'screening', 'was', 'held', 'nearly', 'three', 'weeks', 'film', 'limited', 'release', 'date', 'Everyone', 'who', 'attended', 'was', 'handed', 'what', 'was', 'referred', 'cheat', 'sheet', 'not', 'only', 'helped', 'describe', 'film', 'also', 'went', 'detail', 'Circus', 'definitions', 'code', 'names', 'terms', 'were', 'used', 'film', 'being', 'mentioned', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'have', 'seen', 'original', '1979', 'film', 'receive', 'cheat', 'sheet', 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'then', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'lost', 'most', 'film', 'Five', 'years', 'ago', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'director', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'released', 'film', 'called', 'Southland', 'Tales', 'unusual', 'thing', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'episodes', '4-6', 'prequel', 'graphic', 'novel', 'contained', 'episodes', '1-3', 'interesting', 'approach', 'credit', 'trying', 'something', 'different', 'bottom', 'line', 'most', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'up', 'film', 'released.With', 'said', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', ""n't"", 'completely', 'incomprehensible', 'still', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'very', 'slow', 'moving', 'film', 'dialogue', 'more', 'anything', 'tell', 'story', 'nonlinear', 'sense', 'storytelling', ""n't"", 'smooth', 'transition', 'bit', 'difficult', 'keep', 'track', 'times', 'Did', ""n't"", 'character', 'die', 'earlier', 'Was', ""n't"", 'working', 'somebody', 'else', 'five', 'minutes', 'ago', 'Wait', 'wait', 'wait', 'WHAT', 'Who', 'HELL', 'guy', 'are', 'types', 'questions', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'asking', 'majority', 'characters', 'seem', 'very', 'similar', 'one', 'even', 'share', 'similar', 'hairstyles', 'everyone', 'basically', 'off', 'old', 'bitter', 'people', 'working', 'government', 'are', 'paranoid', 'mole', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'retired', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'kind', 'odd', 'film', 'around', 'retired', 'agents', 'attempting', 'be', 'pulled', 'back', 'service.Gary', 'Oldman', 'fascinating', 'performance', 'George', 'Smiley', 'comparison', 'most', 'other', 'film', 'characters', 'known', 'Smiley', ""n't"", 'even', 'speak', 'good', 'while', 'Oldman', 'probably', 'shown', 'screen', 'least', 'good', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'actually', 'anything', 'fact', 'Oldman', 'went', 'such', 'precise', 'detail', 'just', 'pick', 'out', 'appropriate', 'pair', 'glasses', 'character', 'admirable', 'one', 'magnificent', 'scene', 'film', 'office', 'Peter', 'Guillam', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'story', 'how', 'Karla', 'never', 'returned', 'engraved', 'lighter', 'easily', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'also', 'fairly', 'fantastic', 'role', 'quite', 'bit', 'emotion', 'film', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'type', 'solid', 'performance', ""'d"", 'expect', 'English', 'actor.Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'have', 'few', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'mostly', 'performances', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'decorative', 'setting', 'use', 'unique', 'perspective', 'automatically', 'film', 'appealing', 'eye', 'film', 'really', 'bland', 'majority', 'time', 'extremely', 'uneventful', 'Even', 'when', 'something', 'violent', 'occur', 'obscurity', 'rather', 'quickly', 'covered', 'up', 'gargantuan', 'amounts', 'jargon', 'constantly', 'regurgitated', 'everyone', 'on-screen', 'So', 'few', 'semi-decent', 'performances', 'experience', 'least', 'visually', 'intriguing', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'thriller', 'never', 'really', 'thrilling', 'constant', 'uphill', 'battle', 'stay', 'awake', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'exhilarating']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

In reality, as author John le Carre could tell you, it's more of a waiting game: mundane activities backed but a sense of dread and anticipation.  TINKER captures this atmosphere perfectly, as master spy George Smiley comes out of retirement to track down a high-ranking KGB mole.Atmosphere is key here.  Tomas Alfredson perfectly captured growing dread in his previous effort, LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.  He continues his efforts here, working from an Oscar-nominated script by Brigdet O'Connor and Peter Straughan.  Aiding him are some of the best British character actors of our time: Toby Jones, Colin Firth, John Hurt, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, Ciaran Hinds, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Simon McBurney.  The anchor here is Gary Oldman, giving what is infamously his first Oscar-nominated performance.  Oldman's Smiley is proper and polite, superficially harmless; but as the movie progresses, and Smiley closes in on his prey, he becomes more and more dangerous.  It's a subtle progression, and one only an actor of Oldman's caliber (calibre?) could pull off.TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY isn't for everyone.  It isn't a great film; like its source novel, it's a bit complex and dense (viewers will need two or three attempts to figure out everything that's going on), and casual viewers will be put off by the lack of action, and the overall ""British-ness"" of the film (yeah...it's a shame, but you know it's gonna happen).

It's not your typical movie full of gratuitous violence and chase scenes. It's low-key, but for a purpose. I think it portrays very well the idea (perhaps not realistic) of the confusing world of spycraft, where you often don't know what's fact, what's fantasy, the often paranoid atmosphere, the grueling, occasionally exciting daily life of the spook.I previously read the book, but it's been many years. I vaguely remember the plot from the book, and it seems the movie does not exactly follow the book. But it doesn't really matter. I think the movie correctly conveys the atmosphere in ways that a book cannot, and does not diverge significantly from the plot of the book.Gary Oldman is great as George Smiley. Smiley is an aging British spymaster, previously forced into retirement years ago, along with other agents, when an operation went wrong, and agent Jim Prideaux was shot in Budapest. Retired, Smiley swims alongside other retirees in a local lake, watches soap operas on TV, and grows older.Now, a British intelligence agent on the run (Ricki Tarr) alleges there is a mole within the intelligence services, based on what the Russian agent Irina told him, and Smiley is called back to investigate. Smiley picks Peter Guilliam (Benedict Cumberbatch) to help ferret out the mole.The suspects are faces on chess pieces, left behind by the previous head of intelligence, &#34;Control&#34;, who was forced to retire along with Smiley. The suspects are the new head of intelligence Percy Alleline (pugnacious Scot) and his allies Bill Haydon (upper crust English), Toby Esterhaze (east European), and Roy Bland (dark mooded English). Finally, Smiley himself is a suspect. Each suspect is quite different in mehhod and personality.Behind the scenes is the Russian spymaster &#34;Karla&#34;. Smiley tried to &#34;turn&#34; Karla decades in the past. Now Karla is fooling the British at their own game, with the British mole secretly passing along the British &#34;crown jewels&#34; in Alleline's &#34;Witchcraft&#34; operation that was supposedly getting secret Russian intelligence in exchange for &#34;chicken feed&#34;, but has backfired. And now American intelligence may become compromised.Smiley is inscrutable as he figures things out.

Instead, you'll be treated to the intellectual side of things as George Smiley unravels the layers hidden within his own &#34;Circus&#34; as the British Intelligence agency is affectionately known. There's a mole, a double agent in the highest ranks and &#34;Control&#34; the head of the Circus is forced out after an operation goes horribly wrong. Although Smiley is sent packing with Control, he is soon recalled to find the mole by some worrying politicians. Smiley gets to pick his team, which consists of some reliable people, all well-played, and all willing to make the sacrifices necessary to get the job done. Smiley himself is a flawed individual, one willing to tolerate his wife's infidelity, his nation's scorn, his fellow spy-master's diatribes with hardly a ruffled feather. Smiley is brilliantly played by Gary Oldman. Oldman truly is incredible in this role, living up to my expectations developed from reading LeCarre's book of the same title. The movie stays as consistent as possible to the book, serving up the tedium of real spy work in huge stretches. No, this is not a James Bond thriller, but a rather a careful look at human frailty writ through the reality of the cold war.

The novel is very dense and I wasn't sure a two hour theatrical film could do the work justice.  It does but there is so much great character and story elements that had to be jettisoned I still wonder if a moviegoer who hasn't read the book will be able to keep up.  I'm fairly certain the patient and astute filmgoer will be able to, others may have a hard time of it.TTSS is not a film for the ADD set. If you feel you have to continually text or talk during a film then you should stick to something within your comfort zone because this movie will plow right over your short attention span. TTSS is a film about spies in the '70's Cold War but isn't REALLY about spies, it's about betrayal, political and personal disillusionment and whether or not there is a clear separation between right and wrong. It depicts a morally bleak landscape populated by gray little men and women who work in a field that has an inherent moral rot to it to begin with. It's a slow and deliberately paced film that demands you pay attention to it. I know this doesn't sound like a positive critique but TTSS really is a film worth seeing.

The original book (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) is one of John le Carre's best written and most expertly plotted novels, which tells the tale of how Britain's spies discover and then deal with a high-placed Soviet mole. The movie is a double mess, since the lazy script will make little sense to those who haven't read the book and will offend those who have. Characters appear and disappear, mumbling their way through flat dialogue, and little of it makes no sense. Who are these people? What are they trying to achieve? Why are they speaking in code? Why should we care?The director takes vast and unwise liberties with the script. In the book, the British spies realise they have a problem when an agent goes to Czechoslovakia to make contact with a supposed defector and ends up being shot and injured in a wood at night. This isn't dramatic enough, so the film moves the action to the Hungarian capital Budapest (which is pronounced BudapeSHt, not Budapest, by the way, the researchers could and should have figured that one out), and the agent is shot in a botched incident which also kills the young mother of a suckling infant. This is gratuitous violence.As in the book, the agent takes on a false name and becomes a teacher at a boy's school, where he befriends one particularly unhappy and lonely boy who happens to be a good observer. In the book the friendship deepens, whereas in the film the teacher suddenly turns on the child and tells him to get lost. With about 20 minutes to go the movie disintegrates into incoherence and you have the impression that the director just threw scenes together without bothering to see if they made sense. He invents a Christmas party for the British spies where they drunkenly sing the Soviet anthem, and then an agent on the run makes a confused appearance, and there's a search for crucial documents, and the mole is unveiled, and this all unfolds with about as much drama and tension as the monthly meeting of a knitting club. We don't care about the characters and we don't care about the storyline.In short, this is a disaster.

It's also a very revealing look at the whole cynical business of international spying/intelligence. Fine acting, particularly from Mark Strong, Gary Oldman, David Dencik, and Colin Firth.TTSS is obviously a bit too slow-moving for the fast action crowd.

Thurlow,"[163, 179]","""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is a well-executed adaptation of John Le Carre's classic espionage novel of the Cold War, with a first-rate cast, a haunting atmosphere, and a compelling narrative.""Tinker"" goes right to work.  The opening sequence has field agent Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) on an off-the-books mission to Hungary for the head of the British Secret Intelligence Service, known as Control (John Hurt).  Control suspects a mole within the upper reaches of the Service, and asks Prideaux to send back a codeword identifying the spy, using the children's nursery rhyme.  The mission is compromised, Priddeaux is shot, and Control and his deputy George Smiley (Gary Oldman) are fired.A restless Smiley is recalled to duty by a senior civil servant to investigate some unfinished business involving Ricki Tarr (a blonde Tom Hardy), a field agent who claims to know a vital Soviet secret and who has gone off the grid.  With the assistance of Tarr's desk officer, the young Peter Guillam (an astonishingly good Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley quietly renews the search for the mole.  Some old-fashioned detecting leads Smiley and Guillam down a thin trail of clues to four suspects and a fateful confrontation at a house in London.Although only two hours long, ""Tinker"" manages to work in the key elements from a long novel, and gets some terrific work from the cast, especially Gary Oldman as Smiley, a weary Cold War veteran whose long brooding silences speak volumes.  The 1970's setting of the novel is evoked in detail with hair and clothing fashions, music, and technical props such as typewriters, old-fashioned teletypes, and reel-to-reel tape recorders.  The pacing of the story keeps the suspense alive to the end.The inevitable comparison is with the superb BBC TV mini-series of the late 1970's starring Alec Guinness as Smiley.  It is a weakness of the movie that at just two hours, it lacks the time to properly introduce the many characters or the period to a modern audience who may not have experienced the Cold War.  There isn't a lot of exposition in the movie, and this reviewer, who was very familiar with the novel and the mini-series, suspects some viewers may have trouble following the story.""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is highly recommended as an excellent and atmospheric spy drama.",5,A Brooding Silence...,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,2317,"['Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'well-executed', 'adaptation', 'John', 'Le', 'Carre', 'classic', 'espionage', 'novel', 'Cold', 'War', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'haunting', 'atmosphere', 'compelling', 'narrative', 'Tinker', 'right', 'work', 'opening', 'sequence', 'field', 'agent', 'Jim', 'Prideaux', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'off-the-books', 'mission', 'Hungary', 'head', 'British', 'Secret', 'Intelligence', 'Service', 'known', 'Control', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Control', 'mole', 'upper', 'reaches', 'Service', 'Prideaux', 'send', 'back', 'codeword', 'identifying', 'spy', 'using', 'children', 'nursery', 'rhyme', 'mission', 'compromised', 'Priddeaux', 'shot', 'Control', 'deputy', 'George', 'Smiley', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'are', 'fired.A', 'restless', 'Smiley', 'recalled', 'duty', 'senior', 'civil', 'servant', 'investigate', 'unfinished', 'business', 'involving', 'Ricki', 'Tarr', 'blonde', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'field', 'agent', 'who', 'know', 'vital', 'Soviet', 'secret', 'who', 'gone', 'off', 'grid', 'assistance', 'Tarr', 'desk', 'officer', 'young', 'Peter', 'Guillam', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Smiley', 'quietly', 'search', 'mole', 'old-fashioned', 'detecting', 'Smiley', 'Guillam', 'down', 'thin', 'trail', 'clues', 'four', 'suspects', 'fateful', 'confrontation', 'house', 'London.Although', 'only', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'Tinker', 'manages', 'work', 'key', 'elements', 'long', 'novel', 'terrific', 'work', 'cast', 'especially', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Smiley', 'weary', 'Cold', 'War', 'veteran', 'long', 'brooding', 'silences', 'speak', 'volumes', '1970', 'setting', 'novel', 'evoked', 'detail', 'hair', 'clothing', 'fashions', 'music', 'technical', 'props', 'such', 'typewriters', 'old-fashioned', 'teletypes', 'reel-to-reel', 'tape', 'recorders', 'pacing', 'story', 'suspense', 'alive', 'end.The', 'inevitable', 'comparison', 'superb', 'BBC', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'late', '1970', 'starring', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'Smiley', 'weakness', 'movie', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'time', 'properly', 'introduce', 'many', 'characters', 'period', 'modern', 'audience', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'experienced', 'Cold', 'War', ""n't"", 'lot', 'exposition', 'movie', 'reviewer', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'familiar', 'novel', 'mini-series', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'trouble', 'following', 'story', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'highly', 'recommended', 'excellent', 'atmospheric', 'spy', 'drama']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

1447998,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0059XTTW8,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 5]","TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY (Dir. Tomas Alfredson, 2011, 129 minutes) was a film I waited a long time to see and I feel richly rewarded. Knowing nothing of John le Carr&eacute;'s novel or the original film version starring Alec Guinness as George Smiley, this was fresh and new to me. All of it. I have no idea what is happening now but I cannot wait until I get to see how they handle the sequel, ""Smiley's People"".Beginning in 1973 with the firing of MI-6 British Secret Service top brass ""Control"" (John Hurt) and George Smiley (a stunning Gary Oldman), one of a half dozen members of ""the circus"" - the top cabal in British Intelligence - the film resumes with blinding speed a year later. Control informed the Undersecretary to the Prime Minister (the boss who fired them) that a mole exists in the top sphere.When the Undersecretary finally gets it, he calls Smiley back onto the job. Find this mole, he tells Smiley. It's an ugly, or rather, stupid, can of worms Smiley upsets ... and I loved the way this film approaches the Cold War espionage game as a dank, evil game that no one dares quit and no one seems to be winning. Smiley understands life is winning one small step at a time. It seems his motto is ""Learn and earn.""Bear one thing in mind, which I will not spoil: Smiley certainly ""earns"". Want a clue like any good spy? - check out the cover photo of this DVD issue.A few things to know about George Smiley as Oldman presents him: he is not ""retired"" as is mindlessly repeated again and again. He has been fired. The reasons are unclear and never mentioned. Smiley has admirers throughout the Ministry, as seen in the vital moments when he leaves for the last time: the eyes following him, some of the hardest in the world, widen with respect and sadness.He's not a rumpled or sloppy man: he is the absolute Englishman, debonair, quiet and still to the point of being a statue, a tribute to British Intelligence. He is nearly emotionless, but clearly he is a normal human. His tidiness adds to his hidden genius, reflecting his massive inner strength. The glasses, a Smiley ""icon"", emphasize his sensitive, sad eyes. It is said Oldman flew to Pasadena to an eyeglasses shop and tried hundreds of pairs before he hit on ""Smiley's glasses"".Clearly he is a spy, born and bred. In some weird way Oldman manages to be almost a brother to Hurt, while also channeling Alec Guinness in ways I loved. The stiff, cogwheeling body language, the eerie stillness ... and the voice. The voice is 100% Oldman but is an homage to Guinness the likes of which Ewan MacGregor could not achieve in the Star Wars prequels. Just terrific. I totally disagree with Roger Ebert's position that Oldman convinces because he is so bland he simply vanishes into a room the moment he walks into it.In my view, Oldman electrifies every scene. One can sense right away what ""the circus"" will lose when he leaves.The problem here is this is a half hour TV spy story, no better, only stretched out interminably and with some of the least amount of dialogue I have ever experienced in film. Of course, this adds to the intense and almost limitless power of George Smiley when he does cadence out a few lines here and there. However, while I appreciated the dank symbolism of the claustrophobia of this film, it did not finally serve the story well.The director, though he usually stuns viewers and achieved a masterwork with the vampire filmLet The Right One In(see my review) might have learned a bit from Spielberg for this film.This is a must-own for any spy enthusiast - especially those interested in Britain's role during the Cold War in its last decade. The all-star cast is a blessing and a must. It includes Benedict Cumberbatch as Smiley's young gay assistant agent, Colin Firth, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, Toby Jones, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy and Simon McBurney.",5,Best spy film in ages ... but that's just me,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,3849,"['TINKER', 'TAILOR', 'SOLDIER', 'SPY', 'Dir', 'Tomas', 'Alfredson', '2011', '129', 'minutes', 'was', 'film', 'waited', 'long', 'time', 'see', 'feel', 'richly', 'rewarded', 'Knowing', 'nothing', 'John', 'le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'novel', 'original', 'film', 'version', 'starring', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'George', 'Smiley', 'was', 'fresh', 'new', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'happening', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'handle', 'sequel', 'Smiley', 'People', '.Beginning', '1973', 'firing', 'MI-6', 'British', 'Secret', 'Service', 'top', 'brass', 'Control', 'John', 'Hurt', 'George', 'Smiley', 'stunning', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'one', 'half', 'dozen', 'members', 'circus', 'top', 'cabal', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'film', 'blinding', 'speed', 'year', 'later', 'Control', 'informed', 'Undersecretary', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'boss', 'who', 'fired', 'mole', 'exists', 'top', 'sphere.When', 'Undersecretary', 'finally', 'Smiley', 'back', 'job', 'Find', 'mole', 'Smiley', 'ugly', 'rather', 'stupid', 'can', 'worms', 'Smiley', 'upsets', 'loved', 'way', 'film', 'Cold', 'War', 'espionage', 'game', 'dank', 'evil', 'game', 'one', 'quit', 'one', 'be', 'winning', 'Smiley', 'understands', 'life', 'winning', 'one', 'small', 'step', 'time', 'motto', 'Learn', 'earn', 'Bear', 'one', 'thing', 'mind', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'Smiley', 'certainly', 'earns', 'Want', 'clue', 'good', 'spy', 'check', 'cover', 'photo', 'DVD', 'few', 'things', 'know', 'George', 'Smiley', 'Oldman', 'not', 'retired', 'mindlessly', 'repeated', 'again', 'again', 'been', 'fired', 'reasons', 'are', 'unclear', 'never', 'mentioned', 'Smiley', 'admirers', 'Ministry', 'seen', 'vital', 'moments', 'when', 'last', 'time', 'eyes', 'following', 'hardest', 'world', 'widen', 'respect', 'sadness.He', 'not', 'rumpled', 'sloppy', 'man', 'absolute', 'Englishman', 'debonair', 'quiet', 'still', 'point', 'being', 'statue', 'tribute', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'nearly', 'emotionless', 'clearly', 'normal', 'human', 'tidiness', 'hidden', 'genius', 'reflecting', 'massive', 'inner', 'strength', 'glasses', 'Smiley', 'icon', 'emphasize', 'sensitive', 'sad', 'eyes', 'said', 'Oldman', 'flew', 'Pasadena', 'eyeglasses', 'shop', 'tried', 'hundreds', 'pairs', 'hit', 'Smiley', 'glasses', '.Clearly', 'spy', 'born', 'bred', 'weird', 'way', 'Oldman', 'be', 'almost', 'brother', 'Hurt', 'also', 'channeling', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'ways', 'loved', 'stiff', 'cogwheeling', 'body', 'language', 'eerie', 'stillness', 'voice', 'voice', '100', '%', 'Oldman', 'homage', 'Guinness', 'likes', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'could', 'not', 'achieve', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels', 'Just', 'terrific', 'totally', 'disagree', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'position', 'Oldman', 'convinces', 'so', 'bland', 'simply', 'room', 'moment', 'it.In', 'view', 'Oldman', 'scene', 'One', 'can', 'sense', 'right', 'away', 'what', 'circus', 'will', 'lose', 'when', 'leaves.The', 'problem', 'here', 'half', 'hour', 'TV', 'spy', 'story', 'better', 'only', 'stretched', 'out', 'interminably', 'least', 'amount', 'dialogue', 'have', 'ever', 'experienced', 'film', 'course', 'intense', 'almost', 'limitless', 'power', 'George', 'Smiley', 'when', 'cadence', 'out', 'few', 'lines', 'here', 'there', 'However', 'appreciated', 'dank', 'symbolism', 'claustrophobia', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'finally', 'serve', 'story', 'well.The', 'director', 'usually', 'viewers', 'achieved', 'masterwork', 'vampire', 'filmLet', 'Right', 'One', 'see', 'review', 'might', 'have', 'learned', 'bit', 'Spielberg', 'film.This', 'must-own', 'spy', 'enthusiast', 'especially', 'interested', 'Britain', 'role', 'Cold', 'War', 'last', 'decade', 'all-star', 'cast', 'blessing', 'must', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Smiley', 'young', 'gay', 'assistant', 'agent', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Simon', 'McBurney']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

1448015,AO9764AKXA3JI,B0059XTTW8,"Go for Baroque ""Go for Baroque""","[7, 12]","Some film critics have given the movie version of Tinker Taylor high marks, but for me this long-awaited movie version was a sad disappointment.  Because the six-part television series (now on DVD) is of such high quality, I knew that the recently released theatre version would find the series to be a hard act to follow.  I saw the theatre version  26 December, 2011.  My concerns were fully justified.  In my subsequent discussions with a film professor, I had to clarify for him that my disappointment was not so much based upon the fact that the BBC series had the advantage of its longer length in which to more fully portray characters and personalities as well as more detailed and complete plot.  I evaluated the movie solely based upon its own  merits.  I thought at great length about every detail of the movie.  I finally had to come to the conclusion that everything remarkable and captivating about the BBC series is missing in the film.To start with, the original book is of high quality.  Then, the television screen play is excellent both from the stand point of plot and with dialogue.  In the series, each character was perfectly cast for physical appearance as well as admirable acting skill.  The viewer consequently is able to gain clear insight into the individuals' personalities, characters, roles in MI6, interaction among each other, their strengths and their weaknesses.  The characters come across as real people whom the viewer learns to know.  Sir Alec as George Smiley succeeds in communicating more with his tone of voice, pauses, and non-verbal communication than many actors can speaking words.  For example when near the end he is asked to ""take charge for a while,""  the potent effect of Smiley's delivery upon the others at the meeting table is so memorable that I can quote those lines.In the movie, however, some actors just did not look the part.  The individual playing Percy reminded me more of the CIA buffoon in ""Hopscotch"" than the stuffed-shirt MI6 director.  In the film, the acting was not always consistent with what the characters should be.  I have great admiration for the acting skill of Gary Oldman based upon his diverse roles which I previously have seen.  In this film, however, his reserved demeanor looks more sullen and uncommunicative than aware and contemplative.It appeared to me that the screenwriters and director added some dialogue and action in an attempt to keep the story moving and to help the audience comprehend the story; however, these additions were so out of place that they stuck out like sore thumbs. Unfortunately, some scenes that were the most moving and impressive were omitted but could have been included with little additional time.  So little was portrayed of the character who turned out to be the mole that, when he was caught, the audience well may have asked, ""Who is he?""In regard to the length of the film vs. the series, yes, the series does have the advantage of more time.  Tinker Taylor is a journey back into a different time, a cold-war time when the old-boys network dominated the intelligence services and time seemed not so rushed as it is in the 21st century.  The series permits sufficient time to allow for long pauses in dialogue during which the characters communicate much through their behavior and visual affect.  This is time well spent that any theatre version would be unlikely to take.  I have watched and shared the BBC DVD series several times with friends, and I never have grown tired of it.  My advice is to read the book and to see the BBC version.  I consider it to be my favorite cold-war spy story, and the quality of the series has much to do with it.Addendum October 2013.  I decided to give this film version of ""Tinker"" a second chance, bought the DVD, and watched it carefully.  My original disappointment was only amplified.  As a stand-alone film, it fails badly.  In contrast to the BBC series, it fails miserably.  I suspect that more positive reviews are swayed by the power of the original novel and the big names in the film.  Do purchase the DVD series.  If I were to move and take with me only 5% of my DVDs, I would keep the BBC series (along with ""Smiley's People"").",3,High Hopes but Disappointed,1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,4206,"['film', 'critics', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'version', 'Tinker', 'Taylor', 'high', 'marks', 'long-awaited', 'movie', 'version', 'was', 'sad', 'disappointment', 'six-part', 'television', 'series', 'now', 'DVD', 'such', 'high', 'quality', 'knew', 'recently', 'released', 'theatre', 'version', 'would', 'find', 'series', 'be', 'hard', 'act', 'follow', 'saw', 'theatre', 'version', '26', 'December', '2011', 'concerns', 'were', 'fully', 'justified', 'subsequent', 'discussions', 'film', 'professor', 'had', 'clarify', 'disappointment', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'based', 'fact', 'BBC', 'series', 'had', 'advantage', 'longer', 'length', 'more', 'fully', 'portray', 'characters', 'personalities', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'detailed', 'complete', 'plot', 'evaluated', 'movie', 'solely', 'based', 'own', 'merits', 'thought', 'great', 'length', 'detail', 'movie', 'finally', 'had', 'come', 'conclusion', 'everything', 'remarkable', 'captivating', 'BBC', 'series', 'missing', 'film.To', 'start', 'original', 'book', 'high', 'quality', 'Then', 'television', 'screen', 'play', 'excellent', 'both', 'stand', 'point', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'series', 'character', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'physical', 'appearance', 'as', 'well', 'admirable', 'acting', 'skill', 'viewer', 'consequently', 'able', 'gain', 'clear', 'insight', 'individuals', 'personalities', 'characters', 'roles', 'MI6', 'interaction', 'other', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'characters', 'come', 'real', 'people', 'whom', 'viewer', 'know', 'Sir', 'Alec', 'George', 'Smiley', 'communicating', 'more', 'tone', 'voice', 'non-verbal', 'communication', 'many', 'actors', 'can', 'speaking', 'words', 'example', 'when', 'end', 'asked', 'take', 'charge', 'while', 'potent', 'effect', 'Smiley', 'delivery', 'others', 'meeting', 'table', 'so', 'memorable', 'can', 'quote', 'movie', 'however', 'actors', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'part', 'individual', 'playing', 'Percy', 'reminded', 'more', 'CIA', 'buffoon', 'Hopscotch', 'stuffed-shirt', 'MI6', 'director', 'film', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'consistent', 'what', 'characters', 'should', 'be', 'have', 'great', 'admiration', 'acting', 'skill', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'based', 'diverse', 'roles', 'previously', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'however', 'reserved', 'demeanor', 'more', 'sullen', 'uncommunicative', 'aware', 'contemplative.It', 'appeared', 'screenwriters', 'director', 'added', 'dialogue', 'action', 'attempt', 'keep', 'story', 'moving', 'help', 'audience', 'comprehend', 'story', 'however', 'additions', 'were', 'so', 'place', 'stuck', 'out', 'sore', 'thumbs', 'Unfortunately', 'scenes', 'were', 'most', 'moving', 'impressive', 'were', 'omitted', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'little', 'additional', 'time', 'So', 'little', 'was', 'portrayed', 'character', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'mole', 'when', 'was', 'caught', 'audience', 'well', 'may', 'have', 'asked', 'Who', 'regard', 'length', 'film', 'series', 'yes', 'series', 'have', 'advantage', 'more', 'time', 'Tinker', 'Taylor', 'journey', 'back', 'different', 'time', 'cold-war', 'time', 'when', 'old-boys', 'network', 'dominated', 'intelligence', 'services', 'time', 'seemed', 'not', 'so', 'rushed', '21st', 'century', 'series', 'sufficient', 'time', 'allow', 'long', 'pauses', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'communicate', 'much', 'behavior', 'visual', 'affect', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'theatre', 'version', 'would', 'be', 'unlikely', 'take', 'have', 'watched', 'shared', 'BBC', 'DVD', 'series', 'several', 'times', 'friends', 'never', 'have', 'grown', 'tired', 'My', 'advice', 'read', 'book', 'see', 'BBC', 'version', 'consider', 'be', 'favorite', 'cold-war', 'spy', 'story', 'quality', 'series', 'much', 'do', 'it.Addendum', 'October', '2013', 'decided', 'give', 'film', 'version', 'Tinker', 'second', 'chance', 'bought', 'DVD', 'watched', 'carefully', 'My', 'original', 'disappointment', 'was', 'only', 'amplified', 'stand-alone', 'film', 'badly', 'contrast', 'BBC', 'series', 'miserably', 'suspect', 'more', 'positive', 'reviews', 'are', 'swayed', 'power', 'original', 'novel', 'big', 'names', 'film', 'Do', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'series', 'were', 'move', 'take', 'only', '5', '%', 'DVDs', 'would', 'keep', 'BBC', 'series', 'Smiley', 'People']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"
1448016,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0059XTTW8,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY is a challenging cinematic interpretation of John le Carr&eacute;'s novel of the same name, This is not an action movie: this is a quiet study of how the intelligence operations of several countries function - slowly, quietly, secretly, mesmerizingly, and occultly. To fully comprehend the complex story it would be best to read the novel first: the film condenses a long tale into just over 2 hours and for the uninitiated this can result in a conundrum of semi-fleshed out events. But if you are in for an intense psychological drama that requires 100% of your attention then this is a movie to savor.One aspect of the confusion that accompanies this film's story is the random uses of time changes - some things are shown in various stages of their development as they affect the story and some remain in the present, giving a time travel feel to the film. Odd little bits of action clarify this for the viewer: in the opening of the film George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is fitted for new glasses (a very fine bit of photography form cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema) and that is the clue that when he is wearing his new glasses we are in the present and not in a flashback.As for story it is fairly well known: we are in the Cold War in the 1970s and Control (John Hurt), the irascible Head of the British Intelligence resigns after a botched attempt to ferret out a mole in Hungary by sending Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) on a mission. Prideaux is killed. Convinced there is a Russian agent serving as a mole Control brings on George Smiley (Gary Oldman) to investigate a story agent Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy) feels compelled to share. Smiley considers that the failure of the Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding the mole. Through the efforts of Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley obtains information that eventually leads him to Jim Prideaux, the agent at the heart of the Hungary fiasco. And on it goes with the resolution of events offered to the viewer behind the same sort of shady gauze that hides much of the work of Intelligence.The strong cast includes key roles by Toby Jones, David Dencik, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, Colin Firth and Simon McBurney.  Though Gary Oldman's performance is definitely worthy of the praise he has received, it is the performance by Tom Hardy that sets a level of excellence to which all the other actors must strive to achieve.  Have a good night's sleep that night before viewing, a couple of strong cups of coffee, and stay hyper alert: the film is well worth exploring and digesting.

So how does the cast stack up against the original book and BBC/PBS series? Well, first Gary Oldman is a &#34;Human Chameleon&#34;... Second, He must have patterned his character after the late great Sir Alec Guinness, CH CBE. He follows Alec Guinness very closely in his acting method and behaviors. He does it very well. I enjoyed the movie. Be warned that this is a modern telling of the tale and give a nod to the gays when they cast  Peter Guillam as a homosexual. Maybe I missed that in the original BBC/PBS series?

1448021,A6QMY5WPTVAT1,B0059XTTW8,"Gregory J. Casteel ""Dr. Gregory J. Casteel""","[2, 3]","Okay, let's go ahead and get the trite yet obligatory comparisons out of the way first so we can put them behind us and move on.  Let it be stipulated from the outset that this movie is not as good as the John le Carr&eacute; novel it is based on, or the 1979 BBC television miniseries starring Alec Guinness and Ian Richardson.  Having said that, let's get real for a moment:  No movie is ever as good as the book it is based on; and there's simply no way to pack as much storytelling into a two hour movie as can be packed into a six hour miniseries.  So, these sorts of comparisons are really unfair, and are not very helpful.  A movie should be judged on its own merits -- i.e. whether or not it is worth watching -- not by how closely it follows its source material or other retellings of the same story.  The only situation that would justify criticizing a movie for not living up to the book it was based on would be one in which the movie radically changes the plot of the story, or else completely misses the point that the original author was trying to make.  As long as a movie tries to be faithful to the novelist's vision, then the screenwriters and director shouldn't be criticized simply for making the sorts of alterations and abridgements that are always necessary when adapting a book for the silver screen.  John le Carr&eacute; writes very complex stories; and no movie can ever hope to fully capture the layered intricacy of his writing.  Yet, in spite of this, some truly excellent films have been made based on his novels, the most brilliant being ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" starring Richard Burton, which is arguably the best spy movie ever made.  Even that movie is not as good as le Carr&eacute;'s novel; but it is a cinematic masterpiece, nonetheless.  So, let's ignore all those critics who have nothing more original to say than, ""It's not as good as the book,"" or, ""The TV version was better,"" and review this movie on its own merits.So, when judged on its own merits, is this a good movie?  Is it worth watching?  Would I recommend it to others?  Absolutely yes!  This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  It is wonderfully written and brilliantly acted.  And the director takes some creative risks that, at least in my opinion, really pay off in terms of setting the right mood.  Rather than trying to turn this into a fast-paced thriller, he lets the story unfold gradually, as it does in the novel.  Rather than explicitly spelling everything out in detail, he trusts the audience to be able to follow the plot, read between the lines, and figure out what's going on without having to be spoon fed information.  Rather than relying on dialogue to give us a sense of who the characters are, he makes creative use of silence -- often long stretches of uncomfortable silence -- that forces us to look beyond the words people say, which are often used to conceal the truth, and focus instead on the non-verbal cues that people give off, which paint a more honest portrait of who they are and what's going on inside their heads.  These creative choices might alienate some audiences; but I think that most John le Carr&eacute; fans will appreciate them as much as I do.As for the plot, the movie is really just a very condensed version of the book.  There are a few, relatively minor changes here and there, most of which are necessary simply in order to fit this expansive story into a two-hour film.  But you'd have to be the world's biggest nitpicker to fault this movie for these trivial alterations.  It certainly remains true to the story the author was trying to tell; and it definitely has the ""feel"" of a John le Carr&eacute; novel.  If you've read the book, and/or have seen the miniseries, I think you'll be happy with how faithful this movie is to the original story.  And if you haven't already read the book or seen the miniseries, watching this movie may actually inspire you to do so.The casting of this movie is absolutely amazing.  Gary Oldman gives a totally convincing portrayal of George Smiley, the quiet, world-weary spymaster called out of retirement to find a Soviet mole at the highest levels of British intelligence.  I still can't help but picture Alec Guinness whenever I think of Smiley; but Oldman's performance is just about as close to flawless as one could hope for.  If the filmmakers decide to make a sequel or two (it would be wonderful if they could do the entire Karla trilogy), and Oldman reprises his role, then I just might start picturing him instead of Guinness whenever I re-read one of le Carr&eacute;'s Smiley stories.  Oldman's supporting cast is also superb.  Benedict Cumberbatch (of ""Sherlock"" fame) turns in a stellar performance as Peter Guillam, Smiley's right-hand man (who seems to get more screen time than any other character, except perhaps Smiley himself).  Colin Firth (best known of late for ""The King's Speech"") doesn't really get all that much screen time as Smiley's old friend, colleague, and romantic rival Bill Haydon; but he sells the part quite nicely.  And the incomparable John Hurt gives what has to be seen as the definitive portrayal of Control, Smiley's old boss, the former head of British intelligence, who was forced into retirement when his obsession with uncovering a traitor within his inner circle led to disaster.For those who are not familiar with this story, it's set in the early 1970s, at a time when the Cold War had begun to settle down into a shadowy game of chess played between spies and counterspies.  The old men who played this game had long since let go of any illusions that what they were doing was noble or patriotic.  It was simply necessary.  And, since the pieces on the chessboard were human beings, many of whom would have to be sacrificed in the course of the long game, the players had to develop a callous pragmatism and a cold detachment from the people around them.  In this world, secrecy was essential, suspicion was rampant, and trust was a luxury that often came at too high a price.  These soulless spymasters led miserable lives, with little consolation apart from the occasional moment of fleeting advantage gained over their opponents in the long game.  This is the setting for John le Carr&eacute;'s intriguing tale about the hunt for a ""mole"" (i.e. a traitor spying on behalf of the Soviets) inside the topmost levels of the Circus (i.e. the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6).  I don't want to spoil the plot; so I won't say any more.  But if you enjoy realistic spy stories (as opposed to the larger-than-life James Bond or Jason Bourne stuff), I think you'll really enjoy this movie.As for the DVD/Blu-ray release, the special features are a little thin; but, let's be honest, you're getting this for the movie, not for the bonus material on the disc.  The movie is definitely worth having on DVD or Blu-ray, especially if you're a big John le Carr&eacute; fan like I am.  I've always regarded ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" as le Carr&eacute;'s best Cold War spy novel (even better, in my opinion, than ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"").  So, I love this story and the characters in it; and I think this movie handles the story and the characters admirably.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would highly recommend it.",5,A must-see film for all lovers of great spy fiction,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,7299,"['Okay', 'let', 'go', 'ahead', 'get', 'trite', 'yet',

1448029,A34UX3N0AO73CK,B0059XTTW8,HollyNYC,"[1, 1]","Tinker Tailor Soldier SpyWhen I first heard about this project (in an Entertainment Weekly feature on Colin Firth after he won the Oscar for ""The King's Speech"") my first reaction was mixed: I've always loved the story, but wondered why they would go back and re-do a novel that was made into a 6 hour TV miniseries still considered the gold standard for TV movies. And le Carre's works have a mixed record when it comes to film adaptations, for every ""Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" there's a ""Little Drummer Girl.""Then I reflected that George Smiley is just as much a pop culture icon, in his way, as James Bond or Jason Bourne or  Sherlock Holmes, and if their stories can be constantly revived, rebooted, and relaunched for each generation (or even within generations) then I guess Smiley can have his turn too.  And this film obviously has the approval of Smiley creator John le Carre, who is one of the producers and appears in a holiday party sequence (I've always heard that le Carre felt he lost control of the Smiley character after the B.B.C. miniseries, readers came to associate Smiley with Alec Guinness, who was not whom le Carre pictured Smiley -- too old, too tall, too thin).The story of ""Tinker, Tailor""  remains basic in whatever format it appears. The aging head of British intelligence, known only as ""Control,""  suspects his agency has been penetrated by a double agent working for the Soviets, a ""mole"" in espionage parlance. Control sends an agent behind the Iron Curtain to learn the identity of the mole, but it turns out the agent has been sent into a trap set up by ""Karla,"" the Russian K.G.B. agent in charge of infiltrating imperialist Western intelligence services. Control is forced to resign in disgrace. About a year later, an A.W.O.L. British spy surfaces with evidence confirming Control's suspicions. Because George Smiley has been in retirement, his innocence of being the mole is self-evident, and he is tasked with uncovering the double agent, which he does by setting a trap of his own.Director Tomas Alfredson and the cast, which seems to include every contemporary British actor of note with the exception of Michael Fassbender (who was originally scheduled to appear in the movie before having to bow out) does a remarkable job of bringing this quintessential Cold War story to the contemporary screen. The movie follows the general outline of the novel, with many scenes,  out of necessity,  compressed or sped-up. As with the novel, the movie skips back and forth in time, I've both read the book and seen the B.B.C. mini-series twice, and even I had trouble following  what was going on at times. One visual clue to follow is Smiley's eyeglasses (one style before he retired, one style afterward). Interestingly, however, one key flashback scene, when Smiley has his one face-to-face encounter with his  arch-nemesis Karla in New Delhi, is not dramatized, but simply recalled by Smiley as the camera stays tight on his face. The scene is mesmerizing, and I doubt few other actors could have pulled it off. Oldman really anchors the film. Compared to Alec Guinness his Smiley is a bit less passive, less of a fussy academic ostensibly bumbling his way through the world of espionage and more of a ruthless operator prepared to do whatever it takes to get the job done. (To be fair to Guinness, he does display more of this side of Smiley's character in the sequel ""Smiley's People."")Of course, when a story of this scope is reduced to a movie with a little over 2-hours running time, some elements are lost which gave the original story much of its nuance and resonance. To me, one of the biggest losses is that of Ann Smiley, George's vivacious wife. Her role is small, but critical to understanding Smiley's character, and underlining the theme of betrayal, personal and public,  which runs throughout the story. In the film, she's a barely-glimpsed presence, her role in the larger narrative only hinted out. Also lost in the shuffle  are the characters of Smiley's fellow spy chiefs who are the suspected moles. Talented actors like Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, and Colin Firth do what they can, essentially working  with brushstrokes, but the Jane Austin comedy of manners style which distinguishes le Carre's work is largely lost. Still, there is some addition by subtraction here. I, for one, was glad to be spared the traitor's banal self-justification for his acts of betrayal.Among the other notable story changes of note are the sexual orientation of Peter Guilliam, who serves as the Watson of the story, and the location of the Ricky Tarr sequences, moved from Hong Kong to Istanbul (perhaps because they couldn't film in the former colony now that it is back in the possession of the Chinese, and perhaps Istanbul was chosen as a substitute as an Easter egg of sorts, a reference to to Kim Philby, the double agent who served as the model for the mole, who was stationed there while still working for British intelligence). Overall, the whodunnit nature of the story is downplayed, the narrative is more of a ""how are they gonna catch him?"" story. And yes, the film does work as a thriller. The stakes are high, people are chased, guns go off (even if the bloodshed is usually more tragic in nature than heroic), and, in one ingenious  sequence, a plane landing  on a tarmac has you sitting on the edge of your seat.Some have questioned if ""Tinker Tailor,"" even in its abbreviated form, has become a dinosaur, its pace too leisurely, its plot too complex, for today's hyped-up audiences who need everything spoon-fed to them  and have seizures if something doesn't explode on screen every five minutes or so. le Carre started writing his espionage fiction in the early 1960s as a corrective to the James Bond model permeating pop culture at the time, which depicted spying as fun, glamorous work, performed by heroic supermen  who embodied the natural superiority of Western capitalism.  To paraphrase what a literary critic once said about the mystery writer Ross MacDonald, other espionage writers write about secrets, le Carre writes about sin. Yes, he can get preachy at times (especially in his later, post-Cold War work), but at his best, such as ""Tinker Tailor,"" he provides absorbing thrillers that also serve as cautionary tales about the moral rot that can set in when a society, seeing itself locked in a great ideological struggle with an implacable foe, sublets its security, and its conscience, to mortal men operating in a shadowy, covert world virtually devoid of any outside control or accountability. Even in societies that like to think of themselves as the ""good guys."" Especially in those societies (are you listening, Uncle Sam?). In le Carre's world, there are no ""good guys,"" only professionals out to inflict damage. It's all a matter of whom they inflict the damage on, how they do it, and why, that distinguishes them on the moral calculus.""Tinker Tailor Solider Spy"" is one of those movies that are the proverbial acquired taste. Those going in expecting a Jason Bourne or Tom Cruise ""Mission Impossible"" style thriller will probably be reaching for the ""eject"" button after 10, 15 minutes or so. However, if you're a John le Carre fan, this is definitely for you. I also recommend this movie for anyone unfamiliar with le Carre but are fans of other entertainments for thinking people, genre works that are character driven, such as the ""Wallender"" novels and TV films, ""Homeland,"" or ""Sherlock.""I'm keeping my fingers crossed this same cast and crew tackle ""Smiley's People"" next.",5,George Smiley Version 2.0,1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,7568,"['Tinker',

This is a great film, not for the easily confused, and not for the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE crowd either. It's the most labyrinthine film I've seen in YEARS. It is confusing and I felt that some of the characters weren't quite as fleshed out as I would have liked, particularly Ciaran Hinds, but it's a wonderfully stylish and quiet spy thriller packed from beginning to end with top-notch performances, particularly from Oldman as well as a surprisingly strong performance from Mark Strong. I've seen him in a number of films but never been truly impressed. Relegated to playing the heavy in films like the first Downey SHERLOCK HOLMES to KICK-ASS to GREEN LANTERN, I felt like I was missing something that so many others had seen. In TTSS, I finally got it. Also, Tom Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch do excellent work as well.Honestly, I have not read the book, but I took my father, an avid Le Carre fan and lover of the ""Smiley"" books, and not only did he really enjoy it, but he also remarked that it held up quite well with the source material.",5,Many of the negative reviews say the same thing:,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,1199,"['IT', 'EXPERTLY', 'ACTED', 'BUT', 'IT', 'DULL', 'pretty', 'convenient', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'contrarian', 'wanted', 'give', 'take', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'easily', 'confused', 'not', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'crowd', 'either', 'most', 'labyrinthine', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'YEARS', 'confusing', 'felt', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fleshed', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'particularly', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'wonderfully', 'stylish', 'quiet', 'spy', 'thriller', 'packed', 'beginning', 'end', 'top-notch', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Oldman', 'as', 'well', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'performance', 'Mark', 'Strong', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'number', 'films', 'never', 'been', 'truly', 'impressed', 'Relegated', 'playing', 'heavy', 'films', 'first', 'Downey', 'SHERLOCK', 'HOLMES', 'KICK-ASS', 'GREEN', 'LANTERN', 'felt', 'was', 'missing', 'something', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'had', 'seen', 'TTSS', 'finally', 'got', 'Also', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'do', 'excellent', 'work', 'well.Honestly', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'took', 'father', 'avid', 'Le', 'Carre', 'fan', 'lover', 'Smiley', 'books', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'really', 'enjoy', 'also', 'remarked', 'held', 'up', 'quite', 'well', 'source', 'material']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

A number of other actors also did a great job, including John Hurt as control. The sets and effort put into re-producing the cold war era was also also very satisfying.  It may also have been easier to find good Russian actors for the more recent series.However, I must say that the cast overall didn't manage, in my opinion, to equal the quality of the TV series. This was particularly true of the four ""suspects"", especially Toby Esterhase and Percy Adeline. Part of the problem was the acting but part of the problem was the script which, in any event, did not manage to develop these characters. With so much effort/time into Smiley/Control/Peter/Ricky/Irena, and only 2 hours available, there wasn't much time left to develop the four characters who are suspected of being the ""mole"". Where the six-hour TV series has plenty of time to give the viewer time to think about (and care!) who the mole is, this movie just jumps to the conclusion too quickly. Moreover, few people will take the six hours in one sitting...watching the old series one hour a night gives you a whole week to think about who the mole is!Given that both are based on the same story and ""give away"" who the mole is, I would suggest that people look into renting the classic TV series first.",3,Ok but the older 6 hour TV series with Alec Guiness was better,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",2012,1382,"['Saw', 'film', 'movie', 'theater', 'recently', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'performance', 'Smiley', 'number', 'other', 'actors', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'including', 'John', 'Hurt', 'control', 'sets', 'effort', 'put', 're-producing', 'cold', 'war', 'era', 'was', 'also', 'also', 'very', 'satisfying', 'may', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'find', 'good', 'Russian', 'actors', 'more', 'recent', 'series.However', 'must', 'say', 'cast', 'overall', 'did', ""n't"", 'manage', 'opinion', 'equal', 'quality', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'particularly', 'true', 'four', 'suspects', 'especially', 'Toby', 'Esterhase', 'Percy', 'Adeline', 'Part', 'problem', 'was', 'acting', 'part', 'problem', 'was', 'script', 'event', 'did', 'not', 'manage', 'develop', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'effort/time', 'Smiley/Control/Peter/Ricky/Irena', 'only', '2', 'hours', 'available', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'time', 'left', 'develop', 'four', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'suspected', 'being', 'mole', 'Where', 'six-hour', 'TV', 'series', 'plenty', 'time', 'give', 'viewer', 'time', 'think', 'care', 'who', 'mole', 'movie', 'just', 'jumps', 'conclusion', 'too', 'quickly', 'Moreover', 'few', 'people', 'will', 'take', 'six', 'hours', 'one', 'sitting', 'watching', 'old', 'series', 'one', 'hour', 'night', 'whole', 'week', 'think', 'who', 'mole', 'Given', 'are', 'based', 'same', 'story', 'give', 'away', 'who', 'mole', 'would', 'suggest', 'people', 'look', 'renting', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'first']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"
1448038,A2IMXKLFI5YETU,B0059XTTW8,"James Schumaker ""Shoeone""","[2, 3]","Gary Oldman and Tinker, Tailor have an impossible task: to measure up to the 1979 BBC mini-series of the same name.  The movie makes a good try, but ultimately falls short. There is just too much to the Le Carre story, and it cannot be told in two hours.There are some interesting aspects to the movie. For instance, the tawdry, bedraggled look to the sets is reminiscent of ""1984"" or ""The Hour,"" and provides an interesting subtext to the gray, unexciting, and often desperately pointless lives of the main characters.  Also, the movie does clarify a few aspects of the plot that were left undeveloped in the mini-series (the fate of Irina chief among them).  But in the main, the viewer is left with the feeling that he came expecting a banquet, only to find that he missed the main course.  Gary Oldman does a good job portraying Smiley, but it is just not possible to top the 1979 performance of Alec Guiness.  I must also say that the supporting cast of the 1979 mini-series is so good (particularly Ian Richardson) that it is hard to overlook how lacking the movie's supporting cast is by comparison. Worse still, a number of characters are combined in the movie while others, like Karla, are dealt with off-stage -- there just isn't enough time to tell the tale.Take my advice: buy a multi-system TV, buy the original BBC mini-series on Amazon.UK (only availble in PAL, Region 2, and only on videotape), and you'll never regret your decision.  I've watched the mini-series at least a dozen times, and every time I discover something new. The movie is entertaining and worth watching, but only once. The mini-series is for the ages.

Watching the older six hour television mini-series with Alec Guinness again...then this new two hour movie was the way to go. The story wasn't changed just shortened; several sideline operations were cut to show only the hunt for the mole in Circus (the British MI6)...there were four suspects. And I enjoyed the George Smiley ""the spy who came in from the cold"" interpretation by Gary Oldman who was a better age for the role; both Guinness and Alexander Knox as Control were old men in the 1979 film. The other performances including Colin Firth and John Hurt were so-so...compared to the fine cast of the tv production. (Although Mark Strong as Jim Prideaux and Benedict Cumberbatch as Peter Guillam were very watchable.) The settings were dark, dreary, and dull except for the ending scenes.A very snappy cabaret song, ""Le Mer"", sung by Julio Iglesias after the mole was discovered ended the film with sunny portraits of the remaining Circus guys...including Smiley, the last spy, sitting on the ""throne"" as its chief. (I'm reminded of a regal bright red suit worn by Henry V at the end of a production of the Shakespeare play at the Newberry Opera House; such spectacle ends an altruistic story on a high note, don't you think?)Although I could have watched this current film without the plot refreshment of the television series....I believe it helped to follow the story better...and to see different actors in the main roles was interesting...

1448041,A378B22B4X5W6I,B0059XTTW8,JCStreetSoldier,"[4, 6]","WHAT IT IS:Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is based on a novel by John le Carre (an expert Spy Thriller author); it was once before adapted into a television series; and now it's been adapted into a star-studded film by director Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In--great film, by the way), starring Gary Oldman (who was rightfully nominated an oscar for his performance), Tom Hardy (Inception), Mark Strong (Kiss Ass), John Hurt, Toby Jones (The Mist, Captain America), Colin Firth, Ciaran Hinds, and Benedict Cumberbatch. Essentially the cast is the equivalent of New Years Eve or Valentine's Day, but with British male actors that target a male audience.PREMISE:As a fan of Christopher Nolan, I can tell you that I was lost a lot in this film. A lot of it was the terminology (Circus, for instance, which has an essential meaning in the plot, except I never fully understood what ""Circus"" was--and no, not a carnival like circus), but that's only a very small gripe. The essential story is that John Hurt's character thinks there's a mole and he dies and only a few people know that he knew about the mole and it was about the mole trying to cover up his tracks and Smiley (Oldman), who came out of retirement for this sort of personal assingment, trying to figure out who the mole is . . . and then Tom Hardy's character has a significant role, but at first it's hard to understand why he has a significant role (and explaining further would be a spoiler); so it's a cluttery mix of ""what's going on?"" premises. But that's the point, isn't it?The point being--with the complexity of the story, the terminology that characters use (without really explaining them), and the essentially trippy way in which the film was edited together--it's hard to follow, and hard to understand.MY THEATER REACTION / REWATCHING ON BLU-RAY:As a fan of Oldman and Hardy, I really enjoyed their acting in the film. I knew from watching it (before Oscar buzz) that Gary Oldman was going to be nominated. But, even though I had seen the film during the day, I felt exhausted upon exiting the theater. It IS a slow film. There's some suspence, but nothing life-threatening. None of the character's live's are on the line, not for a moment. You trust Smiley to find the mole, and the outcome is predictable enough (although ""who"" the mole is isn't necessarily so predictable).Then, on Blu-Ray, first and foremost, there aren't many features, so you might as well buy the DVD instead and save yourself a few dollars (at least I wish I would have done that), but if money's not an issue, then buy the Blu-Ray. It's just not one of the ""must have"" blu-ray movies, like Inception, The Dark Knight, Lord of the Rings--in other words: it has no ""awe"" moments and certainly isn't my definition of ""epic."" Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is just a slow-paced, complex spy movie (and I wouldn't even call it a thriller because it doesn't thrill).CONCLUSION:If you like tasteful cinematography and fantastic acting, then Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is for you. If your favorite director is Michael Bay, for instance, then you won't like this movie; and I'd almost consider that a fact.But, if you're patient, and don't drag your girlfriend/boyfriend to watch the movie with you (because they may complain, unless they're very likeminded), then you may really respect this film. Although, to say that you'll ""enjoy"" the movie would be going against my better judgement. This movie simply isn't everyone's cup of tea. That's why the film itself wasn't up for a nomination. It's really slow. Good, but slow.

Yet a credible threat has taken shape, in the form of a possible mole at the higest levels of the agency. Smiley, though on the outs but extremely loyal to his country, plots to find the traitor, all without raising suspicions within the organization.Oldman is wonderful in the role.

Gary Oldman does an excellent job of playing the understated George Smiley, who must uncover a Russian mole within the leadership circle of British intelligence while battling old age/insignificance and the loss of the love of his life.  George Smiley is the unlikeliest of all action heroes, and this spy thriller the opposite of James Bond.

1448049,A2SMCJHGVG8KN,B0059XTTW8,J. Lusk,"[0, 2]","The anti-Bond spy movie, from the book by John Le Carre. Gary Oldman plays Smiley, an ex British intelligence agent who's called back on the job when his former boss (John Hurt) suspects the presence of a mole in his department. You have to go into this expecting a deliberately paced movie that doesn't spoon-feed you the whole plot. It's not action-packed. It's not about the sexy gadgets and unbelievable action sequences, but the withered perseverance of an aging spy who may not be sexy or hyper-masculine, but makes up for that in sheer intelligence and mental fortitude.

I saw the film out of curiosity, and because of the cast and director. I found the film to be fatally over-compressed. Some atmosphere was present, but character went almost totally by the board.  I was left with the feeling that if I had not read the book and seen the TV version, I would have had little idea, really, of what was going on or just who the characters were.

But in the new adaptation of John le Carre's espionage novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, director Tomas Alfredson banks on the trait so heavily that the rather simple narrative at the film's core is quickly lost in a convoluted mess of long pauses, meaningful glances, and generally frustrating storytelling.It should be noted that this approach works wonders during the film's opening ten minutes or so. The early sequence of a potentially volatile meeting between two edgy gentlemen looking very intense and covert unfolds with palpable tension and remarkable attention to detail, playing out almost like a description-for-description visualization of a novel. However, this alluring scene - followed by a silently character-developing credits sequence - is as far as the thrill goes. Things unravel quickly as characters, subplots, and flashbacks are introduced and subsequently passed over in a whirlwind of information that, upon closer examination, really isn't all that complex. It's just that Alfredson wants us to believe that it is. This decidedly impenetrable structure is the film's ultimate undoing, as it creates an uninterested distance in the audience and renders the proceedings dreadfully dull and boring. In the end, Alfredson favors intricacy over forward momentum and forced style over character development. When the identity of the mole in MI6 is finally revealed, all one can muster is a disinterested shrug, as one can hardly tell the difference between any of the suspects in the first place.",2,Needs Less Tinker and More Spy,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,1634,"['Subtlety', 'can', 'be', 'tricky', 'thing', 'hands', 'craftsman', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'can', 'be', 'pathway', 'masterpiece', 'new', 'adaptation', 'John', 'le', 'Carre', 'espionage', 'novel', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'director', 'Tomas', 'Alfredson', 'banks', 'trait', 'so', 'heavily', 'rather', 'simple', 'narrative', 'film', 'core', 'quickly', 'lost', 'convoluted', 'mess', 'long', 'pauses', 'meaningful', 'glances', 'generally', 'frustrating', 'storytelling.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'approach', 'wonders', 'film', 'opening', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'early', 'sequence', 'potentially', 'volatile', 'meeting', 'two', 'edgy', 'gentlemen', 'looking', 'very', 'intense', 'covert', 'unfolds', 'palpable', 'tension', 'remarkable', 'attention', 'detail', 'playing', 'out', 'almost', 'description-for-description', 'visualization', 'novel', 'However', 'alluring', 'scene', 'followed', 'silently', 'character-developing', 'credits', 'sequence', 'as', 'far', 'thrill', 'Things', 'unravel', 'quickly', 'characters', 'subplots', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'introduced', 'subsequently', 'passed', 'over', 'whirlwind', 'information', 'closer', 'examination', 'really', ""n't"", 'complex', 'just', 'Alfredson', 'believe', 'decidedly', 'impenetrable', 'structure', 'film', 'ultimate', 'undoing', 'uninterested', 'distance', 'audience', 'proceedings', 'dreadfully', 'dull', 'boring', 'end', 'Alfredson', 'favors', 'intricacy', 'forward', 'momentum', 'forced', 'style', 'character', 'development', 'When', 'identity', 'mole', 'MI6', 'finally', 'revealed', 'one', 'can', 'muster', 'disinterested', 'shrug', 'one', 'can', 'hardly', 'tell', 'difference', 'suspects', 'first', 'place']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

1448056,AZC562U18BK2S,B0059XTTW8,J. R. Trtek,"[1, 1]","The first obvious comment to make is that this film must inevitably be compared not only to the Le Carre novel but the television miniseries which preceded it by decades. As others have pointed out, the film suffers the inevitable disadvantage of trying to tell a complex, textured story in just two hours, while Le Carre had the relative luxury of hundreds of pages and the miniseries had six hours of narrative to work with. Be that as it may, the film succeeds in its story telling far better than one might have expected. The viewer's got to work for it, and I'm sure I had a huge advantage in having already read the book and watched the miniseries; still, it's pretty much all there, but in the cramming several elements were lost or distorted. The mission on which Jim Prideaux is wounded is changed significantly, probably for the sake of streamlining the plot, but so is the manner of the final revenge. That alteration at the end does provide for some effective counterpoint and again the saving of several minutes, but it's a less plausible payback than in the book and in its own way rather less satisfying to me. Other changes are less explicable -- why, for instance, the character of Peter Guillam was made gay in the film is beyond me. As for casting, I believe that Gary Oldman is marvelous. I don't think he's any better or worse than Alec Guinness was in the miniseries as George Smiley, just different. And his kind of different works exceptionally well. Other supporting players are quite well cast, but my main problem is with Colin Firth as Bill Haydon. To my mind, Ian Richardson patented that role in the miniseries, and Firth -- though an exceptional actor -- doesn't portray Haydon as well as the detached, ascetic Richardson did. Production values in this film are absolutely first-rate -- the sets capture the dingy workaday world of The Circus and its spies, operatives and bureaucrats, and John Hurt almost steals the film from Oldman in his short appearances as Control. But it remains Oldman's vehicle, and his version of Smiley controls this two hours with the same silent grip that Guinness' character had on the miniseries. Perhaps more so, actually. I'd love to give this film five stars, but the changes and distortions that I mentioned earlier, perhaps so necessary to cram this thing into two hours, make it less than perfect, and so I give it four. But be advised: If you haven't read the book or viewed the miniseries, I'm giving it three stars for you -- I suspect that a lot will be confusing your first time through. Be prepared to watch it several times; it might grow on you.

1448068,A3SG59KJLAQOPG,B0059XTTW8,K. Good,"[0, 1]","I suppose we should be thankful for what this film is - a realistic interpretation of the way the real intelligence community works, or did work in the '70's.  Thankfully, no overly extended chase scenes, gun battles, improbable martial arts, etc.  In fact, there may be only three gun shots in the whole film.  John Le Carre's novel is replicated in atmosphere, realism, and tension.  It's a subtle and dark film, and no doubt some reviewers who thought it slow and dull may not be tuned in to something that isn't ""Mission Impossible Part Whatever.""  So I thank the filmmakers here for trying to provide a cerebral spy film, for a change.But my problem is that I have the memory of the seven-part BBC production from 1979 as my touchstone, and by comparison, this film falls short in some ways. It's unfair to say Gary Oldman is not as convincing as the late great Sir Alec Guinness in the role of George Smiley.  Oldman offers a commendable (if rather constrained) version, given the impossibly short time he gets to develop the character.  This may in fact reveal why the film is a bit unfulfilling - by trying to cram into one reasonable-length film, a sprawling, intricate, complex, and carefully developed story that took the BBC over seven hours to portray was not a task that could be done without truncating something.  This shows in the characters.  Even several of the main characters under suspicion of being the mole in MI6, Bland, Esterhase, and Haydon, have little dialog.  Only Alleline, in my view somewhat miscast with Toby Jones in the role, has significant words that extend very far.This truncation is so extensive that Ann Smiley, the troublesome wife who drives much of Smiley's thinking, is not only without dialog, I don't actually think there's a full facial shot of her (this character was much better developed in the BBC series). Perhaps the director thinks this was an effective device to make Ann mysterious, but it just makes it puzzling how Smiley can be so tortured by her, when we barely know what the heck she looks like, much less what she may say that also creates anguish for Smiley.I suppose for those not already knowing the plot there would also be an issue of confusion, since the non-continuous scene jumping and flashbacks could lose many.  Also, the jargon of period British intelligence could be puzzling to some as well. Again, given so little time to work on the development of what is perhaps one of the best Cold War spy stories, one gets the impression that too much content is being forced into too small of a vehicle.  OK, modern audiences may not have the patience or attention span to sit through many hours of a multi-part series these days, but compressing 7 hours of a story (which as I recall, was still pretty compelling) into 2 hours or so means something's going to be lost.  And this film loses a bit too much.To be fair, I would recommend the film, even if I feel it could have been more complete, and/or more faithful to the full story that I think Le Carre was intending to tell.

Gary Oldman completely disappears into therole of Smiley; the voice, the walk, the tempo are all a uniquecreation, a man who's strength comes from quiet, from watching, fromthinking, not from action.

And Oldman issurrounded by a top flight cast;; Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, John Hurt,Ciaran Hinds, Benedict Cumberpatch, etc.And the film is very well shot, delicately creating a dour world of beigeand brown mazes.But in distilling a story this complex down to two hours, something gota little lost for me.

Was also anticipating seeing the dashing Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch.Loved the aesthetics of the film, the 1970's greige (gray + beige) color of the film, costumes and sets.  The one bold use of color I noted was in a brilliant baby blue necktie worn by Benedict when he went to steal a log of calls from an office. Watch for it; it's mezmerizing.The film lacked color in the way that aspects of the 70's lacked color and pace. So it accurately captured the colorless times and the standoff in the Cold War.  Gary Oldman plays an astute, plodding spy who is being cuckolded by a friend and fellow spy.  It gives him an air of impotence. Loved the chess pieces used to dramatize TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY with faces--great dramatic touch.The movie includes the relevant plot points in the book and brings them to life, albeit changing a few details. But it's accurate enough to satisfy most Le Carre purists.I loved the movie, having read the book.  Not sure how I'd feel if I hadn't read the book.  The book is slow-moving, cerebral, deep and slowly builds suspense.  So, does the movie.  My brother, who hadn't read the book who watched the movie with me, said it held his attention even though he didn't understand it.  Best movie he's ever seen that he couldn't follow, he said.

1448083,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B0059XTTW8,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[4, 6]","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy comes to us with an impressive pedigree. Director Tomas Alfredson previously directed a critically, and publicly acclaimed vampire movie Let the Right One In, a foreign language movie, now remade as Let Me In starring Chloe Moretz. If you don't mind subtitles I highly recommend it, and the remake.Colin Firth won the Oscar last year. Gary Oldman, got nominated for an Oscar for this role. Mark Strong gave a great performance in The Guard, and Ciaran Hinds excels in playing spies, as in The Debt, and Munich.If you're like me you have neither read the book, nor seen the series starring Alec Guinness, so my experience of watching it fresh might be a good indicator.I probably would not have seen it if I did not accidentally meet someone in the movie business, who had seen Gary Oldman and the director do a presentation at their campus.When asked how he would like playing a stoic character, as opposed to his often passionate characters, he said he had waited thirty years to play a role like this, that often actors don't get to pick and choose their parts, but take what is offered and to put food on the table, and hope one day...As the movie begins, we become aware of a 'mole' at the circus, and an agent played by Mark Strong is sent to Hungary for a secret meeting to discover who it is. When complications arise retired agent, the stoic George Smiley played by Gary Oldman is brought out of unscheduled retirement to find the mole, the spy who despises his fellow spies. It's like a game of chess, with chess symbolism, where we read between the lines both of unfurling events, and Smiley's furrowed brows to gauge the churning depths beyond the stoic mask.He has a wife we never see, who cheats on him, and we anticipate a break in that stoic exterior, so as a study of character acting by Oldman this is a wonder to behold. In a way this movie sets out to be deliberately dull, somewhat the antithesis of the impression you get from a Bond movie, these men are bureaucrats, they ironically sing the Russian national anthem at office parties, not much seems to happen, they're not particularly interesting or handsome, with one or two exceptions, then the action livens up with an intrigue, betrayal and occasional murder.When the finger of suspicion points different ways, the 'circus' people suspected get very nervous, knowing full well what the outcome of that suspicion will be.As I sat very close to the screen, close enough to see the dots, I noticed the rather grainy footage like the detail of movies set in that era, the 70s. While I enjoyed it overall, this is definitely a more cerebral movie than say Bond, in fact it reminded me somewhat of The Good Shepherd, a movie I love, starring Matt Damon but which has gained mixed reviews. I think they were expecting The Bourne identity, instead of backroom antics at the CIA, the other circus.Several people around me left the movie early on, did not give it a chance, a yuppie sitting next to me, clearly on an early date, started immediately checking his iphone for other movie showings, was annoying, and thankfully they left shortly after to see a different movie. So this is not perhaps a date movie.I would say that I did not understand everything, some detail was lost I think in reducing this to a two hour movie. For instance, he gets a lighter from Magda,which seems important, who I assume was a woman but apparently was not. From an acting viewpoint, everybody gives a strong perofrmance, from a directing viewpoint, if you're like me you probably want more action, then it would not be what it is.I am now curious to check out the original with Alec Guinness. I think fans of Gary Oldman and/or Le Carre's original story will love it, and a varied response among other people. The movie also got nominated for an Oscar for best adapted screenplay.I hope this was helpful.",4,The spy who spies on spies,1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,3885,"['Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'impressive', 'pedigree', 'Director', 'Tomas', 'Alfredson', 'previously', 'directed', 'critically', 'publicly', 'acclaimed', 'vampire', 'movie', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'foreign', 'language', 'movie', 'now', 'Let', 'Me', 'starring', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'subtitles', 'highly', 'recommend', 'remake.Colin', 'Firth', 'won', 'Oscar', 'last', 'year', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'got', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'Guard', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'excels', 'playing', 'spies', 'Debt', 'Munich.If', ""'re"", 'have', 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'series', 'starring', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'experience', 'watching', 'fresh', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'indicator.I', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'did', 'not', 'accidentally', 'meet', 'someone', 'movie', 'business', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'director', 'do', 'presentation', 'campus.When', 'asked', 'how', 'would', 'like', 'playing', 'stoic', 'character', 'opposed', 'often', 'passionate', 'characters', 'said', 'had', 'waited', 'thirty', 'years', 'play', 'role', 'often', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'pick', 'choose', 'parts', 'take', 'what', 'offered', 'put', 'food', 'table', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'movie', 'become', 'aware', ""'mole"", 'circus', 'agent', 'played', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'sent', 'Hungary', 'secret', 'meeting', 'discover', 'who', 'When', 'complications', 'arise', 'retired', 'agent', 'stoic', 'George', 'Smiley', 'played', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'brought', 'unscheduled', 'retirement', 'find', 'mole', 'spy', 'who', 'fellow', 'spies', 'game', 'chess', 'chess', 'symbolism', 'where', 'read', 'lines', 'unfurling', 'events', 'Smiley', 'furrowed', 'brows', 'gauge', 'churning', 'depths', 'stoic', 'mask.He', 'wife', 'never', 'see', 'who', 'anticipate', 'break', 'stoic', 'exterior', 'so', 'study', 'character', 'acting', 'Oldman', 'wonder', 'behold', 'way', 'movie', 'out', 'be', 'deliberately', 'dull', 'somewhat', 'antithesis', 'impression', 'get', 'Bond', 'movie', 'men', 'are', 'bureaucrats', 'ironically', 'sing', 'Russian', 'national', 'anthem', 'office', 'parties', 'not', 'much', 'happen', ""'re"", 'not', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'handsome', 'one', 'two', 'exceptions', 'then', 'action', 'up', 'intrigue', 'betrayal', 'occasional', 'murder.When', 'finger', 'suspicion', 'points', 'different', 'ways', ""'circus"", 'people', 'suspected', 'get', 'very', 'nervous', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'what', 'outcome', 'suspicion', 'will', 'be.As', 'sat', 'very', 'close', 'screen', 'close', 'enough', 'see', 'dots', 'noticed', 'rather', 'grainy', 'footage', 'detail', 'movies', 'set', 'era', '70s', 'enjoyed', 'overall', 'definitely', 'more', 'cerebral', 'movie', 'say', 'Bond', 'fact', 'reminded', 'somewhat', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'movie', 'love', 'starring', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'gained', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'think', 'were', 'expecting', 'Bourne', 'identity', 'instead', 'backroom', 'antics', 'CIA', 'other', 'circus.Several', 'people', 'left', 'movie', 'early', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'chance', 'yuppie', 'sitting', 'next', 'clearly', 'early', 'date', 'started', 'immediately', 'checking', 'iphone', 'other', 'movie', 'showings', 'was', 'annoying', 'thankfully', 'left', 'shortly', 'see', 'different', 'movie', 'not', 'perhaps', 'date', 'movie.I', 'would', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'everything', 'detail', 'was', 'lost', 'think', 'reducing', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'instance', 'lighter', 'Magda', 'important', 'who', 'assume', 'was', 'woman', 'apparently', 'was', 'not', 'acting', 'viewpoint', 'everybody', 'strong', 'perofrmance', 'directing', 'viewpoint', ""'re"", 'probably', 'want', 'more', 'action', 'then', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'am', 'now', 'curious', 'check', 'out', 'original', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'think', 'fans', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Le', 'Carre', 'original', 'story', 'will', 'love', 'varied', 'response', 'other', 'people', 'movie', 'also', 'got', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'best', 'adapted', 'screenplay.I', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

The acting, the direction, the script and the visuals are all of the very highest order. Its a technical work of a very high order. I had my doubts going in as to how they could compress such a large work effectively into the limits of a single film. But they did it very well. The script is almost a work of art in terms of pushing maximum story and plot in a minimum time.But is this a good or great film. Probably not. For the story to work (in my opinion), the viewer has to care about the suspects and more importantly the viewer has to believe that none of these men could possibly be the mole until shown that one is the mole. But the characters are basically voids or ciphers. We don't know them really at all. And because we don't know them, it makes little difference to the audience which of them is guilty in the end.The biggest actual flaw in the film is toward the end where the mole is given an opportunity to explain himself....and effectively doesn't. He throws out a couple brief lines about asthetics. Realism aside, that explaination is the payoff to the detective story in the film. The payoff in this case is missing. The audience is presented with a guilty character who they care little about who can't even explain his actions. Not a great way to end the film. The payoff is something that the TV version got right.The cinematography is by the nature of the work confused. The story (the novel) is really a 1950s story set in the 1970s. The film really can't recreate either so it provides a sort of lost-in-time mixed up version that combines modern behavior with old machines serving as set dressing. They capture a sort of state of decay in the immediate surroundings but they never really manage to capture the state of decay in the broader society of either the 1950s or the 1970s which is of course important to the story in terms of the motivations of the mole.The film will work as a complex detective yarn for some. It will work better for those who saw the earlier television version and probably best of all for those who have read the book. The more the viewer knows about the story, the less the flaws of the film will matter. The more known about the characters going in, the less the lack of character development among the mole suspects will matter.",3,well done within the limits of the material,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,2335,"['work', 'film', 'craft', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'direction', 'script', 'visuals', 'are', 'very', 'highest', 'order', 'technical', 'work', 'very', 'high', 'order', 'had', 'doubts', 'going', 'how', 'could', 'compress', 'large', 'work', 'effectively', 'limits', 'single', 'film', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'script', 'almost', 'work', 'art', 'terms', 'pushing', 'maximum', 'story', 'plot', 'minimum', 'time.But', 'good', 'great', 'film', 'Probably', 'not', 'story', 'work', 'opinion', 'viewer', 'care', 'suspects', 'more', 'importantly', 'viewer', 'believe', 'none', 'men', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'mole', 'shown', 'one', 'mole', 'characters', 'are', 'basically', 'voids', 'ciphers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'little', 'difference', 'audience', 'guilty', 'end.The', 'biggest', 'actual', 'flaw', 'film', 'end', 'where', 'mole', 'given', 'opportunity', 'explain', '.and', 'effectively', ""n't"", 'out', 'couple', 'brief', 'lines', 'asthetics', 'Realism', 'aside', 'explaination', 'payoff', 'detective', 'story', 'film', 'payoff', 'case', 'missing', 'audience', 'presented', 'guilty', 'character', 'who', 'care', 'little', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'explain', 'actions', 'Not', 'great', 'way', 'end', 'film', 'payoff', 'something', 'TV', 'version', 'got', 'right.The', 'cinematography', 'nature', 'work', 'confused', 'story', 'novel', 'really', '1950s', 'story', 'set', '1970s', 'film', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recreate', 'sort', 'lost-in-time', 'mixed', 'up', 'version', 'modern', 'behavior', 'old', 'machines', 'serving', 'as', 'set', 'dressing', 'capture', 'sort', 'state', 'decay', 'immediate', 'surroundings', 'never', 'really', 'manage', 'capture', 'state', 'decay', 'broader', 'society', '1950s', '1970s', 'course', 'important', 'story', 'terms', 'motivations', 'mole.The', 'film', 'will', 'work', 'complex', 'detective', 'yarn', 'will', 'work', 'better', 'who', 'saw', 'earlier', 'television', 'version', 'probably', 'best', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'more', 'viewer', 'story', 'less', 'flaws', 'film', 'will', 'matter', 'more', 'known', 'characters', 'going', 'less', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'mole', 'suspects', 'will', 'matter']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"
1448090,A3PLM7HS3SVXLL,B0059XTTW8,Mark Dyer,"[0, 0]","Why compare this 2 hour film with the 6 hour serial, or require it to be a precise rendition of a book of more than 400 pages? I thought it a fine attempt to take many plot threads and make two hours of entertainment from them, I enjoyed items that were not present in the book. I do wonder though how the following books will be filmed now that Guillam's character has been changed.Firstly, there are no explosions, chases, babes or helicopters so be prepared to sit, watch and think rather than expect action and glitz to flow over you. Sure, there are some holes and inconsistencies; I suppose that I take a less forensic view to viewing films than do many of the reviewers here.I don't care that we don't see the characters build to point the way to the identity of the mole because for me the identity of the mole is immaterial. This is about loyalty, betrayal and sacrifice. A few examples:* Guillam ends his relationship immediately on considering that it might be used against him, quite a sacrifice in my opinion.* A terrific moment of acting as Smiley makes a deal with Tarr that he knows will violate Tarr's trust because he can't fulfil the spirit of the deal.* What a strange world where someone who makes such a sacrifice for their country ends up living in a caravan and teaching at a boarding school after being bunged only a few quid and a car.There were some nice juxtapositions that made me think of how fragile lives might be and the fine line between normality and hardship. During a most stressful task undertaken by Guillam we see many characters singing along and playing along to George Formby singing Mr Woo; presumably chosen in the script as being light and frivolous and something that Roy Bland would be likely to sing afterwards to show Guillam how closely he was being observed.

In essence, I question whether a two hour format is the appropriate medium for this material at all, particularly since there is so much plot (even in its reduced form) that it trades off with characterization. Of the possible moles, for instance, only Alleline has a clearly defined persona-- not because the acting is poor or unmemorable (indeed, the whole cast is a bit of an English character actor dream team), but because so much has been cut (Bland's part has been nearly excised altogether). Even when scenes remain, a good 85% of the dialog from the book is gone (a shame, this, since Le Carr&eacute;'s dialog is so good). This means the audience never invests in any suspects, nor has the time or data to ponder who the mole could be. It is difficult for me to imagine an audience caring one way or the other who the mole is at the reveal when he has been on screen for maybe five minutes prior to that point..John Hurt makes a strong impression as Control (it is John Hurt, after all), and Gary Oldman is fine as Smiley (though I'll always imagine Alec Guinness in the role), but because the movie is never allowed to breathe, I find myself strongly preferring the television cast at nearly every point (probably because they get to do things in the television version like actually deliver dialog or remain on-screen for more than ten seconds at a time). The movie could really have used another thirty minutes or so to allow the performances to register. It could also have used an injection of the humor from the source material..In the end, the book and the television adaptation are both much better, and my recommendation would be to investigate both (in that order). This version is not a disaster by any means, but neither is it terribly good (at least in comparison). A word or caution, however: though *Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy* is a spy novel, it is not a thriller. Instead it is a serious, character-driven book whose characters just happen to be spies.

I dreaded the idea of a remake when I first heard of its production, then grew to be generally excited when I heard about the strength of the cast. I really looked forward to its theatrical release and went as soon as it showed in my city.The production is superb. I have seen very few modern movies that have taken such extreme care in a period piece. The details are exquisite and flawless. It even looks as if the film they used to film the movie was from the late 70's to early 80's. I grew up then, and the time-line details gave it a very authentic and reminiscent feel.The acting is top-notch. Gary Oldman is one of the great character actors of our time. Colin Firth is entirely in his element as the upper crusty snob. John Hurt has been playing great bad leaders since his performance as Caligula inI, Claudius. However, the best performance in this film was from Benedict Cumberbatch, who has recently wowed everyone with his revolutionary performance asSherlock: Season One [Blu-ray]. His performance is perfectly understated and riviting, he steals the show and hold the production together.This is a perfectly competent rendition of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. It captures the essence of Le Carre's novel. The actors do a splendid job. But there is something that just falls flat about it. And I would probably think higher of it, were it not for the previous adaptation. If you've never seen the previous adaptation, you will enjoy this production more. I'm absolutely certain of that.If your an invested fan of the original production or the book it will be impossible to not draw comparisons between the two adaptations. Its rare that a television mini-series can trump a film. However, all that makes this current adaptation good, was already done in the original. No actor could equal Sir Alec Guinness's portrayal of George Smiley. That version looks like it was filmed in the late 70's as well, because it was.. And it has an equally competent supporting cast, including the great Ian Richardson.I'm all for each generation re-interpreting great works for themselves and adding their new voice to it. But thats what falls flat here, there is nothing essentially new added to this production. It is simply a remake - not a new rendering or interpretation. This production is drafting off of the greatness of the first. By all means watch it if you've never seen either version or if your a fan of the original.

1448104,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0059XTTW8,mirasreviews,"[2, 3]","I still remember the 1979 BBC adaptation of John Le Carr&eacute;'s 1974 espionage novel ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" with admiration, so I wondered if a new theatrical adaptation would be worth the trouble. And I questioned the wisdom of condensing a five-hour miniseries into a two-hour film. I must say that screenwriters Bridget O'Conner and Peter Straughan have done an impressive job of condensing the material. Nothing significant is lost in terms of plot or themes, though don't get to know the characters as well, so Sir Alec Guinness' superb turn as George Smiley is unchallenged.During the Cold War, the head of the British foreign intelligence service (John Hurt) and his deputy George Smiley (Gary Oldman) are forced into retirement when an operation to uncover the identity of a Soviet double agent goes wrong. But Undersecretary Oliver Lacon (Simon McBurney) thinks the mole is real and asks Smiley to find the leak. Smiley recruits Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch) to help investigate British intelligence's inner circle: Percy Alleline (Toby Jones), Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds), Toby Esterhase (David Dencik), and Bill Hayden (Colin Firth), a group of officers running the super-secret Operation Witchcraft, a goldmine of intelligence from inside the KGB.One challenge in condensing this material is keeping it coherent. There have been complaints that this film is incomprehensible to those who haven't read the book. Well, it's been 30 years since I read the book, and I understood the film perfectly, but you do have to think to follow the connections between some scenes. To alleviate this, the characters sometimes articulate what they are thinking, which I found awkward. There have been other complaints that the chronology is difficult to discern. Usually the audience can identify a flashback by what precedes it, but there is some deliberate ambiguity about sequence that isn't worked out until near the end.Perhaps ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is a little bit of work to watch. I just didn't find any fault there. But every set is self-consciously shabby. There are teetering stacks of papers in every room, on every surface. Everyone seems to live like a mentally ill person, in a pig sty. Likewise, every wall is papered with a ghastly print. The wallpaper in the SIS conference room is an optical illusion that is reflected in the flawless, polished table. The color scheme is drab. It's a vision of the apocalypse, not of government bureaucracy in the 1970s. It's distracting and comical. Director Tomas Alfredson is to blame. And the ending is weak. Just the last couple of scenes are poor, unfortunately.But the intent is to comment on the world today, not the world as it was 40 years ago. George Smiley seems not to think much of British intelligence or its ideals. SIS' inner circle are presented as an insular community of deluded, immoral, old men chasing their tails. They seem conscious of the futility of their schemes but resigned to pursuing them. Everybody loses. There was a certain amount of that in the book and the 1979 adaptation, but the new version lays it on thick. This is not a Cold War view of the intelligence community. It is a post-9/11 view. In this way it reminds me of the excellent 2010 French film ""Farewell"" - the Cold War re-envisioned as a vehicle for 21st century political dilemmas.",4,"Impressive Condensation of Complex Material, but Poor Choice of Visual Character.",1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,3355,"['still', 'remember', '1979', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'John', 'Le', 'Carr', 'eacute', '1974', 'espionage', 'novel', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'admiration', 'wondered', 'new', 'theatrical', 'adaptation', 'would', 'be', 'trouble', 'questioned', 'wisdom', 'condensing', 'five-hour', 'miniseries', 'two-hour', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'screenwriters', 'Bridget', ""O'Conner"", 'Peter', 'Straughan', 'have', 'done', 'impressive', 'job', 'condensing', 'material', 'Nothing', 'significant', 'lost', 'terms', 'plot', 'themes', 'though', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'Sir', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'superb', 'turn', 'George', 'Smiley', 'unchallenged.During', 'Cold', 'War', 'head', 'British', 'foreign', 'intelligence', 'service', 'John', 'Hurt', 'deputy', 'George', 'Smiley', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'are', 'forced', 'retirement', 'when', 'operation', 'uncover', 'identity', 'Soviet', 'double', 'agent', 'wrong', 'Undersecretary', 'Oliver', 'Lacon', 'Simon', 'McBurney', 'mole', 'real', 'Smiley', 'find', 'leak', 'Smiley', 'recruits', 'Peter', 'Guillam', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'help', 'investigate', 'British', 'intelligence', 'inner', 'circle', 'Percy', 'Alleline', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Roy', 'Bland', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Toby', 'Esterhase', 'David', 'Dencik', 'Bill', 'Hayden', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'group', 'officers', 'running', 'super-secret', 'Operation', 'Witchcraft', 'goldmine', 'intelligence', 'KGB.One', 'challenge', 'condensing', 'material', 'keeping', 'coherent', 'have', 'been', 'complaints', 'film', 'incomprehensible', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'Well', 'been', '30', 'years', 'read', 'book', 'understood', 'film', 'perfectly', 'do', 'have', 'think', 'follow', 'connections', 'scenes', 'alleviate', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'articulate', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'found', 'awkward', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'complaints', 'chronology', 'difficult', 'discern', 'Usually', 'audience', 'can', 'identify', 'flashback', 'what', 'deliberate', 'ambiguity', 'sequence', ""n't"", 'worked', 'out', 'end.Perhaps', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'little', 'bit', 'work', 'watch', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'fault', 'there', 'set', 'self-consciously', 'shabby', 'are', 'teetering', 'stacks', 'papers', 'room', 'surface', 'Everyone', 'live', 'mentally', 'ill', 'person', 'pig', 'sty', 'Likewise', 'wall', 'papered', 'ghastly', 'print', 'wallpaper', 'SIS', 'conference', 'room', 'optical', 'illusion', 'reflected', 'flawless', 'polished', 'table', 'color', 'scheme', 'drab', 'vision', 'apocalypse', 'not', 'government', 'bureaucracy', '1970s', 'distracting', 'comical', 'Director', 'Tomas', 'Alfredson', 'blame', 'ending', 'weak', 'Just', 'last', 'couple', 'scenes', 'are', 'poor', 'unfortunately.But', 'intent', 'comment', 'world', 'today', 'not', 'world', 'was', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'George', 'Smiley', 'not', 'think', 'much', 'British', 'intelligence', 'ideals', 'SIS', 'inner', 'circle', 'are', 'presented', 'insular', 'community', 'deluded', 'immoral', 'old', 'men', 'chasing', 'tails', 'seem', 'conscious', 'futility', 'schemes', 'resigned', 'pursuing', 'Everybody', 'was', 'certain', 'amount', 'book', '1979', 'adaptation', 'new', 'version', 'thick', 'not', 'Cold', 'War', 'view', 'intelligence', 'community', 'post-9/11', 'view', 'way', 'excellent', '2010', 'French', 'film', 'Farewell', 'Cold', 'War', 're-envisioned', 'vehicle', '21st', 'century', 'political', 'dilemmas']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

1448107,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0059XTTW8,M. Oleson,"[6, 9]","Gary Oldman heads an All-Star cast in this interesting spy thriller based on a novel of the same name.  The time is the mid to late 1960's at the height of the Cold War.  The Brits and the Soviets had agents infiltrating each other's country and even their intelligence agency.  George Smiley (Oldman) and his boss known only as Control (John Hurt) are dismissed from MI-6 for spending too much time looking for a spy within their ranks.  After Control dies mysteriously in bed, Smiley is returned to service by the Home Secretary to pursue the potential of a double agent within their ranks.Control had assigned possible targets as chess pieces and gave them the individual code names of the title.  There is very little in the way of action in the film although there are a few brutal torture scenes and violent deaths.  The action is all in the byplay between the characters.  The potential double agent include high ranking officials within MI-6 including Bland (Ciaran Hinds), Haydon (Colin Firth), Alleline (Toby Jones) and Smiley himself.  Smiley enlists the help of a  couple trusted compatriots including Peter (Benedict Cumberbatch) and a wild card agent played by Tom Hardy.Clues as to who the agent might be are few and far between and it is sometimes difficult to keep up with what is going on due to the nomenclature and British accents, but it's fun to try.  There are numerous scenes of silence as Smiley reflects on past events in an effort to tie everything together.  I couldn't help but think of Oldman's performance as Sid Vicious in ""Sid and Nancy"" (1986) where he played the obnoxious, profane drugged out rock star.  A completely different character from this thoughtful, political, cautious and quiet secret agent bureaucrat.  In the end, this is his movie.  His performance is terrific.Blu ray update:  This 1080P disc is presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio nearly the same as the theatrical production.  For those grainophiles, the transfer might be bothersome, but for me it is exactly as I remember in the theater.  This includes the bleak, brownish and smokey coloring.

Set in the 1970s Cold War tensions between Britain and the Soviet Union are presented as anxious with indications that there is a double agent within the highest echelon of the British Intelligence Agency.The narrative of the movie concentrates on the meticulous unraveling of discovering who the traitor is.The cast is absorbing with Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, Toby Jones, and Mark Strong.It is a classic styled spy film and the mild pace of the story allows the viewer to assess the many factors and variables in order to discover the truth. The speed of the narrative may not suit espionage enthusiasts who are accustomed to rapid fire movies like the Bourne films. However, this movie challenges the viewer to think, which certainly counterbalances any lack of speed.Nicholas R.W.

1448116,A12FLZREV32JOP,B0059XTTW8,Noelle Eiram,"[5, 9]","The spies in Tomas Alfredson's artfully crafted adaptation of John Le Carre's 1974 novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy toil away in mundane offices. Most of what they type and read is a mystery. When suspicions of a mole arise, former spy George Smiley is called in as suddenly as he was forced to retire. Throughout the film, one wonders not only about the mole's identity but about where these spies' work begins and their emotional lives end.Though hours shorter than the 1979 BBC adaptation, this version takes its time. The movie, like the book, often forces the audience to read between the lines. Its color scheme is as bleak as the story's Cold War setting, and the camera almost nostalgically observes the drudgery of sorting through physical files and writing with pen and paper. The soundtrack and slower pacing mimic movies of the 1970s, but the cinematography and editing are simultaneously inventive and retro.This very believable world is peopled with chilly characters, played by an excellent array of familiar actors. Each is tinged with suspicion and a hint (or more) of amorality. Beneath even the more demonstrative personalities lie opaque motivations. John Hurt plays the paranoid and cantankerous Control, head of the Circus (the ring of top spies). Toby Jones does well as Percy Alleline, an ambitious spy who gets in a power struggle with Control. Toby Esterhase, a Hungarian working for England, is played convincingly by David Dencik, and Colin Firth perfectly fits the charming Roy Bland.Mark Strong's portrayal of a haunted ""Scalphunter"" is especially poignant, as is Tom Hardy's disturbed Ricky Tarr. Also memorable are Simon McBurney as the bureaucratic but shrewd British undersecretary and Benedict Cumberbatch, touching as Smiley's young assistant Peter Guillam. Gary Oldman plays our unlikely hero, Smiley. For the first half of the film, he hardly says anything. His dull and humble appearance is impossible to read. But his low voice contains a glimmer of cunning. Gradually Smiley's skills of perception and methodical tactics show results. While unassuming and vulnerable, Smiley is also unnaturally calm, and aware of when to use either sympathy or implacability to get the intelligence he needs.A few common phrases (such as ""bad apple,"" and ""trust no one"") pepper the script, but clich&eacute;s are extremely rare. Don't expect these characters to explain why they sacrifice their relationships and moral codes for a tedious job that is both dangerous and thankless. Some likely appreciate the sordid fruits of their labor; others might relish the gathering of information. The older ones hang onto past glories of World War II. Some may not know.The plot jumps between characters and time periods. It is not always clear who is looking for what and why. Yet this confusion adds to the complexity that makes up the world of spies and secrets. The story is confusing, but the sense of alienation that lurks behind the Circus's jokes and jaunty boys' club mentality is all too certain.",5,Spies' Lives Suck,1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,3021,"['spies', 'Tomas', 'Alfredson', 'artfully', 'crafted', 'adaptation', 'John', 'Le', 'Carre', '1974', 'novel', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'toil', 'away', 'mundane', 'offices', 'Most', 'what', 'type', 'read', 'mystery', 'When', 'suspicions', 'mole', 'arise', 'former', 'spy', 'George', 'Smiley', 'called', 'as', 'suddenly', 'was', 'forced', 'retire', 'film', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'mole', 'identity', 'where', 'spies', 'work', 'begins', 'emotional', 'lives', 'hours', 'shorter', '1979', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'version', 'time', 'movie', 'book', 'often', 'audience', 'read', 'lines', 'color', 'scheme', 'as', 'bleak', 'story', 'Cold', 'War', 'setting', 'camera', 'almost', 'nostalgically', 'drudgery', 'sorting', 'physical', 'files', 'writing', 'pen', 'paper', 'soundtrack', 'slower', 'pacing', 'mimic', 'movies', '1970s', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'inventive', 'retro.This', 'very', 'believable', 'world', 'peopled', 'chilly', 'characters', 'played', 'excellent', 'array', 'familiar', 'actors', 'tinged', 'suspicion', 'hint', 'more', 'amorality', 'Beneath', 'even', 'more', 'demonstrative', 'personalities', 'lie', 'opaque', 'motivations', 'John', 'Hurt', 'paranoid', 'cantankerous', 'Control', 'head', 'Circus', 'ring', 'top', 'spies', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'well', 'Percy', 'Alleline', 'ambitious', 'spy', 'who', 'power', 'struggle', 'Control', 'Toby', 'Esterhase', 'Hungarian', 'working', 'England', 'played', 'convincingly', 'David', 'Dencik', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'perfectly', 'charming', 'Roy', 'Bland.Mark', 'Strong', 'portrayal', 'haunted', 'Scalphunter', 'especially', 'poignant', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'disturbed', 'Ricky', 'Tarr', 'Also', 'memorable', 'are', 'Simon', 'McBurney', 'bureaucratic', 'shrewd', 'British', 'undersecretary', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'touching', 'Smiley', 'young', 'assistant', 'Peter', 'Guillam', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'Smiley', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'hardly', 'anything', 'dull', 'humble', 'appearance', 'impossible', 'read', 'low', 'voice', 'glimmer', 'cunning', 'Gradually', 'Smiley', 'skills', 'perception', 'methodical', 'tactics', 'show', 'results', 'unassuming', 'vulnerable', 'Smiley', 'also', 'unnaturally', 'calm', 'aware', 'when', 'use', 'sympathy', 'implacability', 'get', 'intelligence', 'few', 'common', 'phrases', 'such', 'bad', 'apple', 'trust', 'one', 'script', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'extremely', 'rare', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'characters', 'explain', 'why', 'sacrifice', 'relationships', 'moral', 'codes', 'tedious', 'job', 'dangerous', 'thankless', 'likely', 'appreciate', 'sordid', 'fruits', 'labor', 'others', 'might', 'relish', 'gathering', 'information', 'older', 'ones', 'hang', 'past', 'glories', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'may', 'not', 'know.The', 'plot', 'jumps', 'characters', 'time', 'periods', 'not', 'always', 'clear', 'who', 'looking', 'what', 'why', 'confusion', 'complexity', 'up', 'world', 'spies', 'secrets', 'story', 'confusing', 'sense', 'alienation', 'Circus', 'jokes', 'jaunty', 'boys', 'club', 'mentality', 'too', 'certain']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

1448126,A3O288RDWMEZ2T,B0059XTTW8,Paul T. Layman Jr.,"[73, 110]","The only good thing about this waste of celluloid is that it may stimulate interest in the excellent book and TV series -- the novel by John le Carre, volume one of his Search for Karla trilogy, and the BBC 6-hour miniseries starring Alec Guinness as George Smiley.  In fact, if you haven't already encountered those predecessors, your chances of making heads or tails of this new effort are slim.Other reviewers have covered the stone-faced acting of Gary Oldman, the confusing, non-responsive passages of dialog, and the dark, completely uninteresting sets and cinematography.  But the thing that wrecks this movie for me is the loss of any sense of the original story.The novel is a wonderful progression of character and plot that reminds me of Charles Dickens or Jane Austen.  In the book, and the BBC series, the main character arcs -- Jim Prideaux, George Smiley, Peter Guillam, Ricky Tarr -- are mixed with explorations of the supporting actors -- Percy Alleline, Toby Esterhase, Roy Bland, Bill Haydon, Connie Sachs, Jim Roach, Roddy Martindale, Oliver Lacon, Sam Collins, Russian master spy Karla/Guestmann, and especially Jerry Westerby, who becomes the hero of The Honorable Schoolboy, book two of the trilogy -- in a way that leads the reader inexorably to the uncovering of the mole.In the movie there is none of this depth and certainly no enjoyment.  In fact, it's as if the writers sought at every pass to remove elements that reveal the characters and their relationships.  Other reviewers blame the compression into a 2-hour movie, but that just doesn't explain it.  For instance, watching the movie only, you would never guess that Guillam is Smiley's old friend, the person he sought as a drinking companion after being dismissed as assistant head of MI6.  In the car on the way to see Lacon Peter addresses him as Mr. Smiley instead of George.  That was the first discordant note for me.  There were many, many others.Other strikes against the movie include:* Horrible, horrible casting.  While these are obviously professional actors and carry off their roles as written, compare the wonderful casting choices in the BBC series -- tough-guy Ian Bannen as Jim Prideaux, masculine-cum-sardonic Michael Jayston as Peter Guillam, Ian Richardson as supercilious, upper-crust Bill Haydon, the wonderful character actor Joss Ackland as Jerry Westerby.  And of course Alec Guinness, the most gifted actor of all time, as Smiley.* Unnecessary changes to the story line that add nothing, make no sense, and are ineptly done.  Perhaps combining Sam Collins with Jerry Westerby saved time, but then why dress Jerry up in a tuxedo, the way Sam would have been as ex-spy-turned-casino manager?  Never explained.  Why the shooting of Irina in front of Jim Prideaux while a prisoner in the Soviet Union?  They were completely separated in both plot and time.  Jim must have been as confused as I was.* Gary Oldman's portrayal of Smiley.  From movies like Dracula and The Professional we know Oldman is amazing, almost always worth watching.  Here he seems clueless as to his chosen craft.  Smiley, as written and as portrayed by Alec Guinness, was quiet, but commanding and incisive when he spoke, a pivotal character.  Oldman is just silent.* The complete waste of John Hurt as Control -- compare Alexander Knox in the BBC series.* Peter Guillam breaking up with his gay lover -- in the book he is ostentatiously heterosexual.  An obligatory nod to Hollywood's politically correct gay agenda?* Clumsily written scenes -- for example, Alleline's confrontation with Guillam over Tarr's reappearance in England.  Watch the BBC version to see the right way to do this, with little extra investment in time expended.* Poor choice of music, especially at the end.  Bewildering, in fact.* The MI6 office Christmas party.  Nothing remotely like that in the book.  And why, why, why have Santa Claus in a Lenin mask and everyone happily singing along with the USSR national anthem?  Why??* The Americanization of the dialog by removing le Carre's use of British idiom.  If we Americans really don't know that ""sacked"" means fired, are we incapable of figuring it out?* Addition of gratuitous profanity -- the s-word instead of ""chickenfeed"" when describing the Witchcraft intelligence material that bamboozled MI6.  Connie Sachs's use of the f-word.  Not in the book and totally unnecessary.  Possibly to gain a PG-13 rating?* Gratuitous violence -- the shooting of Irina, Jim Prideaux using a sniper rifle instead of a karate chop at the end.  I guess American audiences just won't accept a spy movie without gunplay and gore.  I blame Sean Connery and Jason Bourne.(One note of praise:  At least here MI6 has a decent-sized building.  The BBC production gave the impression they were in rented offices over a failing London bookshop.)As this project proceeded, someone must have seen the disaster it was headed for.  I'm surprised le Carre allowed his name to be associated with the final product.  Was there a mole in the production company?So, read the book and watch the TV series.

Crushing Le Carre's classic spy story into just over two hours required the sacrifice of so much content, tone, character and continuity that this new Tinker comes across as hasty, hard to follow in places and remarkably featureless considering its provenance. There's just no time for anything more. While Oldman is decent enough as George Smiley, it's the sound of one hand clapping. He does not have the gravity Alec Guinness brought to the role in the miniseries -- given the distant, almost uninvolved way Alfredson shot this, he's not permitted to do so -- and, honestly, there's just too much missing, too much changed around or added to no useful purpose and too little atmosphere. (Scenes that were fraught with tension in the miniseries are perfunctory or simply inept here.) Moreover, the script too often lacks the fierce, literate crackle of Le Carre's dialog -- as though the writers were desperate to disassociate themselves from the novel and miniseries (which used it extensively) but unable to supply something equally memorable in its place.

Reviewers are disparaging the portrayal by Gary Oldman, but this alone is not what keeps this movie from succeeding. In my opinion, the screenwriting team of O'Connor and Straughan intentionally abandoned the slow, methodical style of the Carr&eacute; spy novel; instead attempting to recreate a ""Mission Impossible-thriller"" atmosphere. Unfortunately for the viewers, this doesn't work with the story. As a stage director myself, I often choose to have my shows play in updated, or simply different settings, but I never change the crux and core of the storyline as they have. For example, the character of Peter Guillam was not a homosexual in the book, Prideaux was---which is why he exacts revenge on Hayden. Control wasn't a decrepite alcoholic, he simply had a heart condition. Connie was a devoted and long-time analyst with the circus, who liked her drink, not a potty-mouthed wench. The serial-adulteress Ann Smiley is almost completely ignored, save for a really bad scene with Firth fumbling to get his shoes back on his feet. The Christmas party is still baffling me. Not only was there nothing of the sort in the book, it made absolutely no sense in the picture. It certainly didn't move the action forward.I accept the fact that screenwriters face the challenge of taking, in this case, a very long and drawn-out story and condensing it into a 2 hour film. Not every book lends itself to screen adaptations. This book certainly does not. I recommend the BBC miniseries with Sir Alec GuinessTinker Tailor Soldier Spy. This is a fantastic six-hour presentation that faithfully recreates the novel. Naturally, I recommend reading the book.

If you want to know what the movie is about, there are plenty of reviews that just outline the story and base their review on their personal feeling about the film. My goal is to explain why this Blu-ray is worth purchasing.Background/Story: I have to admit, I am a huge Gary Oldman fan. I will see anything that he is in because I think he is a tremendously talented actor with amazing range. That being said, I saw that the film was directed by Swedish director Tomas Alfredson, who is most likely known for ""Let The Right One In"". This is a story of subterfuge and espionage in cold war Britain, focusing on the highest ranks within British Intelligence. Now, I am a huge fan of intelligent and engaging spy films, but be warned; this is not James Bond. Gary Oldman referred to his character George Smiley as ""a thinking man's 007"". Tinker, Tailor Soldier, Spy does not rely on relentless action and explosions, but rather it is carried by a tremendous story and cast. It challenges the audience to actually pay attention in order to remain engaged in the story and for those able accomplish this, they are well rewarded. In terms of cast (which you can look up on IMDB), you couldn't possibly ask for a better group of British actors; it is not difficult to imagine these actors as accurate portraits of cold war British spys.Visuals: For those of you who have seen ""Let The Right One In"" or are familiar with Swedish cinema, it tends to be extremely polarizing because it's slow, often with long periods without dialogue, and a lack of in-your-face action. However, the author of the novel on which this movie is based, John le Carre, consulted on the film and was supportive of Alfredson. While the film can seem slow at times, there are often subtle visual elements that dramatically impact the story. The set design and cinematography are spectacular, aspects that require a keen eye. The film has a soft visual feel, which makes the film feel more period-appropriate.Audio: In terms of the score, the audio is excellent and well balanced. I have watched this film both on standard TV speakers as well as a high-end Bose system. While there is some obvious ADR, the dialogue is clear and the sound does not max out causing distortion. However, I cannot stress enough the importance of paying close attention to the dialogue. In a complicated espionage film, missing a single line could potentially take you out of the film.Special Features: This section will usually make/break my decision to purchase a film. I loved this movie, and would have most likely bought it either way. The special features on this film are rather standard: deleted scenes, cast interviews, and a featurette on the making of the film. But, what makes this movie worth purchasing is the feature commentary with Gary Oldman and Tomas Alfredson. They bring to light some of the more subtle elements of the film that may have been missed by even the most astute viewer. Often, when determining whether or not to purchase a film, I consider whether it is worth multiple viewings.

1448136,A2ZQXJD7YUIEHB,B0059XTTW8,rash67,"[8, 11]","In the midst of Ian Fleming's James Bond ""spy"" romantic fantasy books and novels in the sixties came the real thing. John LeCarre, a former M.I 6 agent (England's CIA) then wrote the best and perhaps the only spy novels which accurately depict real spycraft. And one of the best of these is ""Tinker Tailor"", about Soviet Intelligence placing a secret ""sleeper mole"" (Russian agent) in M.I.6 headquarters, the Circus. Based on real events - Kim Philby was an agent in MI6 recruited by the Russia to spy for them.Gary Oldman does a creditable job depicting the master British spy George Smiley, brought back from early retirement to discover the mole within their rank of the ""Circus"". Writing is, of course  first rate, LeCarre himself was involved in the production of this Cold War drama. The movie runs more than 2 hours.But there was another version of ""Tinker Tailor"" where George Smiley was played by one of the greatest actors of the twentieth century, the late Sir Alec Guiness. For those unfamiliar with him, Alec Guiness played the superb Obi Wan Kenobi in the first released ""Star Wars"" movie! And the tortured British Colonel in ""Bridge Over the River Kwai""! And hundreds of other parts indelibly etched on the memories of movie viewers. Guiness stared in this spectacular over 6 hour production of Tinker Tailor which really captures the essence of the book and is the greatest spy miniseries of all time. Guiness was so good as Smiley, that John LeCarre remarked that when he wrote subsequent George Smiley spy novels he always visualized his character as Alec Guiness!And that is the failing of this movie. In the six hour mini-series, the viewer sees each of the suspects clearly delineated and follows Smileys train of thought. In the Oldman version, all the suspects seem the same and many important plot details, even at a two hour running time, the plot is rushed. For example, when the ""mole"" is discovered, his interesting justification for why he betrayed MI6 and his country is completely missing from this version!It IS ""Tinker Tailor"", Oldman does a good job, but so much seems missing to me....Authentic spycraft, this is what spying is. If you like this movie (or if you don't), buy or rent the Sir Alec Guiness version and you will be blown away!Note: this is an adult movie.

1448139,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B0059XTTW8,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[0, 0]","I read almsot all of John Le Craee's books.  ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" was one of his earlier books.  His early work was beautiful, wonderful prose, very complicated characters.  George Smiley is John Le Carre's alter ego and this character appears in many of the books.  George is smart, introverted and most respected by his ultimate enemy  - Karla - the head of the Russian KGB.  George has one weakness only and that is his wife Anne who he loves more than anyone and anything else in the world.  But they have their (marital) issues and it takes a book to read to understand why.I understand that Gary Oldman was nominated for the Academy Awards for his leading role in this film.  He totally gets the character of George Smiley as John Le Carre wants him to be: burnt out and jaded intelligence agent who keeps a lot to himself.  He is being played by his co-workers in a game where no one is really a winner.  It is simply amazing the accuracy with which Oldman portrays a man who is lonely, deeply unhappy and disillisioned.  There is only one moment in a film when we see George smile - and it is during a flashback when he recalls company party he and his wife attended where he just looks at her adoringly.But overall, this film is a mess.  None of the characters are developed and anyone unfamilar with the story line can possibly follow up what is going on in this movie.  There are flashbacks, action moves in Budapest and London that are difficult to follow because they are so disjointed. I am not even sure that the real feel of the cold war era is truly captured except for the brutali with which intelligence agent are killed  while in action.",2,"Movie is a flop, book is a gem",1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,1667,"['read', 'John', 'Le', 'Craee', 'books', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'was', 'one', 'earlier', 'books', 'early', 'work', 'was', 'beautiful', 'wonderful', 'prose', 'very', 'complicated', 'characters', 'George', 'Smiley', 'John', 'Le', 'Carre', 'alter', 'ego', 'character', 'many', 'books', 'George', 'smart', 'introverted', 'most', 'respected', 'ultimate', 'enemy', 'Karla', 'head', 'Russian', 'KGB', 'George', 'one', 'weakness', 'only', 'wife', 'Anne', 'who', 'more', 'anyone', 'anything', 'else', 'world', 'have', 'marital', 'issues', 'book', 'read', 'understand', 'why.I', 'understand', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'leading', 'role', 'film', 'totally', 'character', 'George', 'Smiley', 'John', 'Le', 'Carre', 'be', 'burnt', 'out', 'jaded', 'intelligence', 'agent', 'who', 'lot', 'being', 'played', 'co-workers', 'game', 'where', 'one', 'really', 'winner', 'simply', 'amazing', 'accuracy', 'Oldman', 'man', 'who', 'lonely', 'deeply', 'unhappy', 'disillisioned', 'only', 'one', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'see', 'George', 'smile', 'flashback', 'when', 'company', 'party', 'wife', 'attended', 'where', 'just', 'adoringly.But', 'overall', 'film', 'mess', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'anyone', 'unfamilar', 'story', 'line', 'can', 'possibly', 'follow', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'movie', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'action', 'moves', 'Budapest', 'London', 'are', 'difficult', 'follow', 'are', 'so', 'disjointed', 'am', 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'real', 'feel', 'cold', 'war', 'era', 'truly', 'captured', 'brutali', 'intelligence', 'agent', 'are', 'killed', 'action']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"
1448140,AZN6SKPJNACKH,B0059XTTW8,Richard Robins,"[8, 8]","I own the Karla Trilogy and read this book in the mid-70s. This Tomas Alfredson film is so rich in nuance and texture that it deserves 5 stars. The reviewers who give it less than 3 stars just don't understand the Cold War period or Circus work environment.As background, I worked on the ChiComm voice desk at NSA during the Vietnam War. I worked at a clandestine Sigint base in East Asia doing analysis of intercepts. IMHO Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy captures the daily grind of intelligence work in the day. It has little of the James Bond penache and excitement.This film is definitely Brit-Euro in speed and artistic tone. One reviewer points out that Gary Oldman, playing super sleuth George Smiley, doesn't have any lines during the 1st twenty minutes, he just sits there taking it all in. What's ultimately going on is his boss is looking for a Soviet Mole at the top of the Circus (HQ) in London. This may be a Cambridge grad recruited in college, producing high quality intellegince for Moscow Centre at the direction of Karla.For a more youthful American audience, the film co-stars Benedict Cumberbatch, recently a co-star of Star Trek Into Darkness, as sidekick to Gary Oldman. Also, Tom Hardy deserves special mention as Ricky Tarr, one of the henchmen who do the dirty work for the Circus. Overall, the cast is full of great European players.I can recommend Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy as a great story about espionage during the Cold War.

It isn't the flashy, fast-paced spy movie with an obvious plot like the typical James Bond story. It also doesn't have the overly-done special effects of the typical American-style action movie. Instead, what it lacks in speed and eye-candy it makes up for with classic who-did-it storytelling. It is the story of a British spy, forcibly retired under suspicious circumstances, being brought back in secret by the highest authorities to reel in a suspected mole in British Intelligence. You watch, you guess, you think.Gary Oldman's George Smiley is a classic old-school detective in this tale. Based on the book of the same name by spy novel author John le Carr&egrave;, this spy story is more like a mix of Clue with Sherlock Holmes than the more common western-style spy story. Smiley follows the clues through thoroughly, trying to figure out which of his former colleagues is the guilty party. The only clue I will give is the guilty party was the most unexpected person at least to this reviewer; maybe you are better at guessing these things than I am. Smiley even has a spy within the agency working for him in secret, getting information to him at great personal risk. The story is great but it does develop slower than most people in this day and age probably would like.The HD transfer and the cinematography itself are very good. In particular pay attention to the chessboard scenes- you will know them when you see them. The sound is very good too- at least given the type of movie this is.In short, I would suggest any avid spy movie fan purchase this movie. If you are only a light fan of the espionage genre, you might wait until it comes down in price or perhaps rent it instead of buying it. If you are a hardcore spy fan, then you might consider reading the book and the several others that follow it in the series. I know it is now on my to-read list. I give this movie 4 stars- only taking one off because I know this movie may lose some appeal to people who like everything fast and obvious.

My wife and I are big fans of the BBC version, which she says did justice to the nuance and complexity of the book.  The new version is a very good movie experience, unusually dense and intricate for 2 hours.

The details of the plot proved difficult to follow, and I was quickly confused. The manner of the presentation, with many flash-backs, did not make understanding any easier.There are positive things about the film as well. The movie captures the atmosphere and the spirit of palpable tension in the Cold War era of the early 1970's through its portrayal of tough, yet beaureaucratic espionage agents, out of the way hotels and homes, high glamor, and violence. The settings in London, Budapest, and Russia are shown effectively and realistically.  Gary Oldman gives a strong performance of the intelligent, tight-lipped and perceptive George Smiley as the lead character.The story involves a Soviet mole who is placed in the upper reaches of British intelligence. The movie opens well as a British agent is ordered to Hungary to receive the name of the mole from a high-placed official. The mole, however, leaks the plan to the Soviets and the agent meets his death. George Smiley, who had earlier been fired, is recalled to service to learn the identity of the mole. The film moves well, for its 130 minute duration, and individual scenes are good. But the story, and the manner in which Smiley uncovers the turncoat, eluded me.My understanding is that the movie greatly compressed and changed le Carre's novel. Even though the movie is lengthy, essential elements of the story were cut. The movie probably will be best appreciated by viewers who have read and enjoyed le Carre's novel because they will have some prior understanding of the story and where it is going. A movie should stand on its own, however, and be intelligible to viewers who have not read the book on which it is based. Although there was a good deal to like in this film, it left me unconvinced and bewildered.Robin Friedman",3,"Atmospheric,Taut, but Difficult to Follow",1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,1970,"['saw', 'new', 'movie', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'having', 'read', 'John', 'le', 'Carre', 'novel', 'based', 'seeing', 'previous', 'adaptations', 'book', 'details', 'plot', 'proved', 'difficult', 'follow', 'was', 'quickly', 'confused', 'manner', 'presentation', 'many', 'flash-backs', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'understanding', 'are', 'positive', 'things', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'spirit', 'palpable', 'tension', 'Cold', 'War', 'era', 'early', '1970', 'portrayal', 'tough', 'yet', 'beaureaucratic', 'espionage', 'agents', 'way', 'hotels', 'homes', 'high', 'glamor', 'violence', 'settings', 'London', 'Budapest', 'Russia', 'are', 'shown', 'effectively', 'realistically', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'strong', 'performance', 'intelligent', 'tight-lipped', 'perceptive', 'George', 'Smiley', 'lead', 'character.The', 'story', 'Soviet', 'mole', 'who', 'placed', 'upper', 'reaches', 'British', 'intelligence', 'movie', 'well', 'British', 'agent', 'ordered', 'Hungary', 'receive', 'name', 'mole', 'high-placed', 'official', 'mole', 'however', 'plan', 'Soviets', 'agent', 'death', 'George', 'Smiley', 'who', 'had', 'earlier', 'been', 'fired', 'recalled', 'service', 'learn', 'identity', 'mole', 'film', 'moves', 'well', '130', 'minute', 'duration', 'individual', 'scenes', 'are', 'good', 'story', 'manner', 'Smiley', 'turncoat', 'eluded', 'me.My', 'understanding', 'movie', 'greatly', 'compressed', 'changed', 'le', 'Carre', 'novel', 'Even', 'movie', 'lengthy', 'essential', 'elements', 'story', 'were', 'cut', 'movie', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'appreciated', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'enjoyed', 'le', 'Carre', 'novel', 'will', 'have', 'prior', 'understanding', 'story', 'where', 'going', 'movie', 'should', 'stand', 'own', 'however', 'be', 'intelligible', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'based', 'was', 'good', 'deal', 'like', 'film', 'left', 'unconvinced', 'bewildered.Robin', 'Friedman']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

It didn't seem possible to reduce such a complex story into a 2 hour movie. But, I gave it a chance. I am very glad I did. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is an exciting, tense, cerebral thriller. The director brilliantly captures the feel of the 1970s, the uncertainty of post-war Britain, the fear of a still-powerful Soviet Union, the claustrophobic and ego-driven good old boys secret service, and the desperate desire on the part of British intelligence to be a player on the international scene. The actors are, across the board, perfectly cast. Gary Oldman has rightly received critical acclaim for his spot-on portrayal of George Smiley, Le Carre's unlikely hero. But equally deserving of praise are Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hardy, Toby Jones, Colin Firth, Ciaran Hinds, Mark Strong, Kathy Burke and David Dencik. The film does take some shortcuts, and changes a number of plot points, which make the film more of a variation on the novel than an adaptation. But the main story-line remains intact. There is a mole in the British Secret Service. George Smiley, who had recently been forcibly retired, is called on to discover the name of the mole, and stop the hemorrhaging of secrets to the Soviets via Karla, Smiley's counterpart and nemesis. One may well ask: do you have to have read the novel to enjoy and understand this 2 hour abbreviated version? Well, when I saw it in the theater my wife came along. She'd never read the novel. But she followed and enjoyed the film. Anecdotal evidence, I know, but evidence. I have a preference for the 6 hour BBC production, primarily because 6 hours provides more room to develop the finer points of plot and character. As a repeat reader of the novel (and its sequels: The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley's People), I appreciate the depth and breadth provided by the longer version.

And it's impossible to say how I would have reacted if I had come to it fresh, but I didn't, and therefore I can only judge it as I found it, which is as a well made,skilfully acted and directed spy thriller, some way short of the masterpiece which other critics have claimed it as. I never really suspended my disbelief.First of all I applaud Alfredson(director of Let The Right One In) for choosing this subject.The outsider's perspective on British themes,here the subject of spying, treachery,the Cold War. Second,his utilisation of the best of British actors to play the roles and especially Gary Oldman.Thirdly,the compression of the vast material of le Carre's Tinker,Tailor into a two hour film,like ""stuffing an elephant into a telephone booth"".I prefer films which explore character and are well plotted,based on reality rather than myth,superheroes,fantasy,the crashbangwallop school of cinema.We are in a grey world of bureaucracy and idealogical struggles,the battle of wits,in a world of human foibles,mistrust,weaknesses.Smiley(Oldman) is brought back out of retirement to track down a traitor in the MI6,facing an adversary as brilliant and inscrutable as himself.Le Carre worked as an operative in the 50s and 60s and his identity was betrayed to the Soviets by the mole Philby,like the one in the film.The mole's option of betrayal is based on ""an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one"",the decline of Empire and anti-Americanism.Hurt,Cumberbatch,Firth and Strong all play pivotal roles.The cinematography reflects well the smoky,claustrophobic,downbeat 70s.We are in a world that's in decline,a world that's passing away,with its drab interiors, filing cabinets,teletexes.The security services are managing decline and denial.Oldman is excellent by understating his performance,avoiding tics,Guinness-imitations, with a hint of menace and steel,not weakened by his wife's adultery,but using it like a chess piece in the game of ruthlessness.I do feel the first 15 minutes put the new viewer at a loss as to what was going on,wonder who half the people are, what their relationship is to each other,what their motivation is.Too much material gets crammed in:Ricki Tarr and the Russian woman,Smiley and Karla,Jim Prideux in a caravan at a prep school with overweight boy. Alfredson has to juggle many balls in the air,using heroic compression via flash back.However the characters aren't as fully developed as in the TV series so their relationships,although complex were more clear.You need the extended running time of the TV series or previous knowledge of the book to fully grasp the story.At the end of it, I found that I liked it, but not as much as I had expected to.The book,TV and film are different mediums and give different experiences.Somehow,here there was a lack of dramatic tension and the unmasking of the mole is an anti-climax.Go and see the TV series and Guinness and then decide how potential moles only have a bit part,the lack of emotional impact at the end.This is a light sketch not a finished artefact.",3,Core values and theoretical apparitions,1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,3128,"['Just', 'be', 'clear', 'was', 'impressed', 'film', 'casting', 'direction', 'impossible', 'say', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'reacted', 'had', 'come', 'fresh', 'did', ""n't"", 'therefore', 'can', 'only', 'judge', 'found', 'well', 'made', 'skilfully', 'acted', 'directed', 'spy', 'thriller', 'way', 'short', 'masterpiece', 'other', 'critics', 'have', 'claimed', 'never', 'really', 'suspended', 'disbelief.First', 'applaud', 'Alfredson', 'director', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'choosing', 'subject.The', 'outsider', 'perspective', 'British', 'themes', 'here', 'subject', 'spying', 'treachery', 'Cold', 'War', 'Second', 'utilisation', 'best', 'British', 'actors', 'play', 'roles', 'especially', 'Gary', 'Oldman.Thirdly', 'compression', 'vast', 'material', 'le', 'Carre', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'stuffing', 'elephant', 'telephone', 'booth', '.I', 'prefer', 'films', 'explore', 'character', 'are', 'well', 'plotted', 'based', 'reality', 'rather', 'myth', 'superheroes', 'fantasy', 'crashbangwallop', 'school', 'cinema.We', 'are', 'grey', 'world', 'bureaucracy', 'idealogical', 'struggles', 'battle', 'wits', 'world', 'human', 'foibles', 'mistrust', 'weaknesses.Smiley', 'Oldman', 'brought', 'back', 'retirement', 'track', 'down', 'traitor', 'MI6', 'facing', 'adversary', 'brilliant', 'inscrutable', 'himself.Le', 'Carre', 'worked', 'operative', '50s', '60s', 'identity', 'was', 'betrayed', 'Soviets', 'mole', 'Philby', 'one', 'film.The', 'mole', 'option', 'betrayal', 'based', 'aesthetic', 'choice', 'as', 'much', 'moral', 'one', 'decline', 'Empire', 'anti-Americanism.Hurt', 'Cumberbatch', 'Firth', 'Strong', 'play', 'pivotal', 'roles.The', 'cinematography', 'well', 'smoky', 'claustrophobic', 'downbeat', '70s.We', 'are', 'world', 'decline', 'world', 'passing', 'away', 'drab', 'interiors', 'filing', 'cabinets', 'teletexes.The', 'security', 'services', 'are', 'managing', 'decline', 'denial.Oldman', 'excellent', 'understating', 'performance', 'avoiding', 'tics', 'Guinness-imitations', 'hint', 'menace', 'steel', 'not', 'weakened', 'wife', 'adultery', 'using', 'chess', 'piece', 'game', 'ruthlessness.I', 'do', 'feel', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'put', 'new', 'viewer', 'loss', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'wonder', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'what', 'relationship', 'other', 'what', 'motivation', 'is.Too', 'much', 'material', 'crammed', 'Ricki', 'Tarr', 'Russian', 'woman', 'Smiley', 'Karla', 'Jim', 'Prideux', 'caravan', 'prep', 'school', 'overweight', 'boy', 'Alfredson', 'juggle', 'many', 'balls', 'air', 'using', 'heroic', 'compression', 'flash', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'fully', 'developed', 'TV', 'series', 'relationships', 'complex', 'were', 'more', 'clear.You', 'need', 'extended', 'running', 'time', 'TV', 'series', 'previous', 'knowledge', 'book', 'fully', 'grasp', 'story.At', 'end', 'found', 'liked', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'had', 'expected', 'to.The', 'book', 'TV', 'film', 'are', 'different', 'mediums', 'give', 'different', 'experiences.Somehow', 'here', 'was', 'lack', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'unmasking', 'mole', 'anti-climax.Go', 'see', 'TV', 'series', 'Guinness', 'then', 'decide', 'how', 'potential', 'moles', 'only', 'have', 'bit', 'part', 'lack', 'emotional', 'impact', 'end.This', 'light', 'sketch', 'not', 'finished', 'artefact']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

Reportedly the press at preview screenings were supplied with cheat sheets. Having seen neither the 1979 BBC mini-seriesTinker Tailor Soldier Spynor read the 1974 John LeCarr&eacute; mega-bestseller, I was lost. After a second run through with the English subtitles turned on, I still had to look on Wikipedia for the plot outline, and this remake STILL adds up to a convoluted muddle.Remarkably, Tinker Tailor &c.; was the top grossing film in the U.K. for its first three weeks in release. One can only imagine all those Brits had a leg up from the viewing the well-regarded BBC series, or that they intuitively resonate with 1970s Cold War cloak-and-dagger machinations literally hashed out over the tea table, or perhaps the English simply tend to read more spy novels. 21st Century American sensibilities, however, generally lack these advantages, which should not be an impossible feat of cinema to overcome. Period espionage films like The Third Man (1949) by British director Carol Reed continue to pack a powerful punch. This flick, however, is somewhat less thrilling than canned peas, which, appropriately, the cinematography's consistently muted tones closely resemble.The aptly named Hardy and Strong are the sole actors exhibiting any signs of testosterone in the bloodstream. Tinker Tailor comes alive during Tom Hardy's brief scenes wherein he radiates a palpable sense of the extreme jeopardy entailed in playing for high stakes. (In short: this guy has balls.  Hardy would make a really interesting Bond, come to think of it.) Mark Strong similarly emanates an aura of danger and consequence, yet both players are hamstrung by the script's failure to ever delineate neither the stakes nor the consequences.The remainder of the consistently saturnine, mostly male cast are not only as uniformly bland and boring as British cuisine of the period, but appear to be suffering authentic gastro-intestinal consequences, as well. Colin Firth fails to demonstrate a range stretching the full distance from A to B, while Gary Oldman never strays an inch off A. His is definitely a contender for the most everlastingly drab performance outside a Mike Leigh movie in the entire depressing history of the British cinema.",2,somewhat less thrilling than canned peas,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,2481,"['were', 'aficionado', 'spy', 'vs.', 'spy', 'genre', 'fiction', 'routinely', 'found', 'airport', 'paperback', 'racks', '70s', 'defy', 'make', 'sense', 'narrative', '2011', 'movie', 'version', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Solder', 'Spy', 'very', 'simplest', 'whodunit', 'levels', 'Reportedly', 'press', 'preview', 'screenings', 'were', 'supplied', 'cheat', 'sheets', 'Having', 'seen', '1979', 'BBC', 'mini-seriesTinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spynor', 'read', '1974', 'John', 'LeCarr', 'eacute', 'mega-bestseller', 'was', 'lost', 'second', 'run', 'English', 'subtitles', 'turned', 'still', 'had', 'look', 'Wikipedia', 'plot', 'outline', 'remake', 'STILL', 'up', 'convoluted', 'muddle.Remarkably', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'c.', 'was', 'top', 'grossing', 'film', 'U.K.', 'first', 'three', 'weeks', 'release', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'Brits', 'had', 'leg', 'up', 'viewing', 'well-regarded', 'BBC', 'series', 'intuitively', 'resonate', '1970s', 'Cold', 'War', 'cloak-and-dagger', 'machinations', 'literally', 'hashed', 'out', 'tea', 'table', 'perhaps', 'English', 'simply', 'tend', 'read', 'more', 'spy', 'novels', '21st', 'Century', 'American', 'sensibilities', 'however', 'generally', 'lack', 'advantages', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'impossible', 'feat', 'cinema', 'overcome', 'Period', 'espionage', 'films', 'Third', 'Man', '1949', 'British', 'director', 'Carol', 'Reed', 'continue', 'pack', 'powerful', 'punch', 'flick', 'however', 'somewhat', 'less', 'thrilling', 'canned', 'peas', 'appropriately', 'cinematography', 'consistently', 'muted', 'tones', 'closely', 'resemble.The', 'aptly', 'named', 'Hardy', 'Strong', 'are', 'sole', 'actors', 'exhibiting', 'signs', 'testosterone', 'bloodstream', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'alive', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'brief', 'scenes', 'palpable', 'sense', 'extreme', 'jeopardy', 'entailed', 'playing', 'high', 'stakes', 'short', 'guy', 'balls', 'Hardy', 'would', 'make', 'really', 'interesting', 'Bond', 'come', 'think', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'similarly', 'aura', 'danger', 'consequence', 'players', 'are', 'hamstrung', 'script', 'failure', 'ever', 'delineate', 'stakes', 'consequences.The', 'remainder', 'consistently', 'saturnine', 'mostly', 'male', 'cast', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'uniformly', 'bland', 'boring', 'British', 'cuisine', 'period', 'appear', 'be', 'suffering', 'authentic', 'gastro-intestinal', 'consequences', 'as', 'well', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'demonstrate', 'range', 'stretching', 'full', 'distance', 'A', 'B', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'never', 'inch', 'definitely', 'contender', 'most', 'everlastingly', 'drab', 'performance', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'movie', 'entire', 'depressing', 'history', 'British', 'cinema']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

A complex plot full of intrigue, double-bluff and the slow revelation of characters' hidden motives through real-time action and flashbacks means if you know Le Carre's novel then you'll be better placed to enjoy the film on first time viewing; if you're unfamiliar with the source material, then seeing the film a second time might make for a more satisfying viewing experience as the number of characters and complexity of the plot can be a bit confusing on first pass.All the cast deliver fine performances with Gary Oldman in superb form as the world-weary but calculating and highly intelligent George Smiley, who has been called out of forced retirement to carry out a discrete investigation to uncover a suspected Soviet mole operating at the highest level of `the circus', the inner core of the UK overseas intelligence service MI6. Oldman has become a fine mature actor and proves here that `less is more', dominating some of his scenes by sheer presence, often with sparse or even no dialogue.The 1970s period detail is pretty accurate with clothes, hairstyles, cars, interiors and the drab accoutrements of office life - paper files, tele-printers, manual typewriters, telephones, dreary furniture - setting the tone. There's not much color here, and the film's look is bleak and washed-out to reinforce the subject matter and the mood. The scenes set in Budapest and Istanbul look even bleaker and greyer than London.The film is true in spirit to Le Carre's 1974 novel, so not natural Hollywood fodder. There is no `hero' (Smiley is a kind of anti-hero); all the characters are in some way flawed and none very sympathetic; there is little cinematic action, no gun battles, explosions or car chases. There is precious little humor, but it's not that kind of film. The few scenes of violence are brief and understated, casual and shocking but never dwelled-on. The audience is invited to pay attention, to watch the characters closely, to listen to the dialogue and think. The duplicitous and closed world of the secretive cold war spying game is very well realized, and has little in common with the glamorous, fast-paced eye-candy of James Bond films.If you like your entertainment served on a plastic plate with fries and fizzy cola to wash it down, best steer clear of `Tinker Tailor'. This is a film for grown-ups, and a more sophisticated palette will better savor its qualities.See if you can spot John Le Carre himself in a brief cameo role...",4,Gary Oldman delivers a memorable performance as George Smiley,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,3088,"['2011', 'Working', 'Title', 'Films', 'production', 'Le', 'Carre', '1974', 'novel', ""'Tinker"", 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'attracted', 'positive', 'critical', 'reviews', 'been', 'generally', 'liked', 'audiences', 'received', 'well-deserved', 'award', 'nominations', 'reportedly', 'made', 'healthy', 'box-office', 'profit', 'modest', 'US', '21', 'million', 'production', 'cost', 'so', 'unexpected', 'commercial', 'success', 'French', 'investor', 'StudioCanal.Director', 'Tomas', 'Alfredson', 'delivered', 'serious', 'film', 'intelligent', 'audience', 'due', 'time-constraints', 'single', '120-minute', 'feature', 'film', 'result', 'necessarily', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'need', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'complex', 'plot', 'full', 'intrigue', 'double-bluff', 'slow', 'revelation', 'characters', 'hidden', 'motives', 'real-time', 'action', 'flashbacks', 'know', 'Le', 'Carre', 'novel', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'better', 'placed', 'enjoy', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'viewing', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'source', 'material', 'then', 'seeing', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'might', 'make', 'more', 'satisfying', 'viewing', 'experience', 'number', 'characters', 'complexity', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'confusing', 'first', 'cast', 'deliver', 'fine', 'performances', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'superb', 'form', 'world-weary', 'calculating', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'George', 'Smiley', 'who', 'been', 'called', 'forced', 'retirement', 'carry', 'out', 'discrete', 'investigation', 'uncover', 'suspected', 'Soviet', 'mole', 'operating', 'highest', 'level', 'circus', 'inner', 'core', 'UK', 'overseas', 'intelligence', 'service', 'MI6', 'Oldman', 'become', 'fine', 'mature', 'actor', 'here', 'less', 'more', 'dominating', 'scenes', 'sheer', 'presence', 'often', 'sparse', 'even', 'dialogue.The', '1970s', 'period', 'detail', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'clothes', 'hairstyles', 'cars', 'interiors', 'drab', 'accoutrements', 'office', 'life', 'paper', 'files', 'tele-printers', 'manual', 'typewriters', 'telephones', 'dreary', 'furniture', 'setting', 'tone', 'not', 'much', 'color', 'here', 'film', 'look', 'bleak', 'washed-out', 'reinforce', 'subject', 'matter', 'mood', 'scenes', 'set', 'Budapest', 'Istanbul', 'look', 'even', 'bleaker', 'greyer', 'London.The', 'film', 'true', 'spirit', 'Le', 'Carre', '1974', 'novel', 'not', 'natural', 'Hollywood', 'fodder', 'hero', 'Smiley', 'kind', 'anti-hero', 'characters', 'are', 'way', 'flawed', 'none', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'little', 'cinematic', 'action', 'gun', 'explosions', 'car', 'chases', 'precious', 'little', 'humor', 'not', 'kind', 'film', 'few', 'scenes', 'violence', 'are', 'brief', 'understated', 'casual', 'shocking', 'never', 'dwelled-on', 'audience', 'invited', 'pay', 'attention', 'watch', 'characters', 'closely', 'listen', 'dialogue', 'think', 'duplicitous', 'closed', 'world', 'secretive', 'cold', 'war', 'spying', 'game', 'very', 'well', 'realized', 'little', 'common', 'glamorous', 'fast-paced', 'eye-candy', 'James', 'Bond', 'films.If', 'entertainment', 'served', 'plastic', 'plate', 'fries', 'fizzy', 'cola', 'wash', 'down', 'best', 'steer', 'clear', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'film', 'grown-ups', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'palette', 'will', 'better', 'savor', 'qualities.See', 'can', 'spot', 'John', 'Le', 'Carre', 'brief', 'cameo', 'role']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

1448178,A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW,B0059XTTW8,The Peripatetic Reader,"[1, 2]","Anyone who truly wants to enjoy this movie must put all recollections or thoughts, if any, of the 1979 mini series with Alec Guinness out of your mind.For those who have seen or have this mini series in their video library, it is a compelling version of the John le Carre novel. Alec Guinness has never been better than in his role as George Smiley, the plodding, methodical, yet one-dimensional spy hired to find a mole in MI 5. The mini series boasts of a well-written script, brilliant direction, and strong, unforgettable supporting roles. The mini series runs for more than six hours; there are no car-chases, no buildings falling down, no gun fights, yet it will keep you at the edge of your chair (or couch) for the entire time the series runs. It is a hard act to follow.This movie does the best job it can to put le Carre's novel in modern-day terms. The major shortcoming of this film is that it tries to better the mini series by imitation -- and there just is no comparison.Gary Oldman, of course, plays the title role of George Smiley, the character portrayed by Alec  Guinness. While Oldman is a fine actor, this is not his finest work. He does not make this character his own. He appears to be imitating Guinness, but what results is Oldman playing Smiley as an Alec Guinness on Valium.Oldman is not alone in the rather blase characterizations in this film version. Some of the other most prominent were:John Hurt. He plays the character of Control, the director of the Circus, attempting to ferret out the mole in the agency. Alexander Knox played Control in the miniseries. Knox was perfect for the role. Knox personified death warmed over, a burearocrat utterly exhausted by the intra-agency in-fighting and back biting. Hurt is good, he has the look, but acts the role as if he is utterly bored by his job, not exhausted.Toby Jones. He plays Percy Adeline, the usurper of Control's position. Michael Aldridge played Adeline in the miniseries, and imbued that role with the pomposity, arrogance, meance that la Carre intended for this character.Mark Strong. He plays Jim Prideaux, the spy who was nearly murdered by the mole in the agency. Ian Banner played Prideaux in the original miniseries, and deftly portrays this character as the broken, shattered spy he was. Strong is not broken or shattered but catatonic.Oddly enough the best portrayal is a lessor character, Toby Esterhasie. David Dencik brilliantly plays this character as the sniveling dog that he is. Also, Tom Hardy is good, very good, in the Ricki Tarr character, the wrong-go outcast who first makes the existence of the mole known.On the whole, however, the actors undoubtedly attempted to portray the tedium and daily grind of the agency. What resulted was a group of actors who appeared to be sleep-walking.Why was Oldman nominated for the Academy Award for this role? No doubt it was the result of collective guilt by the Academy for not previously nominating this actor for his body of work; Lord knows there are other roles he should have been nominated for. He will be nominated soon and hopefully win the statue he so justly deserves.",2,(Yawn),1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,3128,"['Anyone', 'who', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'must', 'put', 'recollections', 'thoughts', '1979', 'mini', 'series', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'mind.For', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'mini', 'series', 'video', 'library', 'compelling', 'version', 'John', 'le', 'Carre', 'novel', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'role', 'George', 'Smiley', 'plodding', 'methodical', 'yet', 'one-dimensional', 'spy', 'hired', 'find', 'mole', 'MI', '5', 'mini', 'series', 'boasts', 'well-written', 'script', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'strong', 'unforgettable', 'supporting', 'roles', 'mini', 'series', 'more', 'six', 'hours', 'are', 'car-chases', 'buildings', 'falling', 'down', 'gun', 'fights', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'chair', 'couch', 'entire', 'time', 'series', 'hard', 'act', 'follow.This', 'movie', 'best', 'job', 'can', 'put', 'le', 'Carre', 'novel', 'modern-day', 'terms', 'major', 'shortcoming', 'film', 'better', 'mini', 'series', 'imitation', 'just', 'comparison.Gary', 'Oldman', 'course', 'title', 'role', 'George', 'Smiley', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'Oldman', 'fine', 'actor', 'not', 'finest', 'work', 'not', 'make', 'character', 'own', 'be', 'imitating', 'Guinness', 'what', 'results', 'Oldman', 'playing', 'Smiley', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'Valium.Oldman', 'not', 'alone', 'rather', 'blase', 'characterizations', 'film', 'version', 'other', 'most', 'prominent', 'were', 'John', 'Hurt', 'character', 'Control', 'director', 'Circus', 'attempting', 'ferret', 'out', 'mole', 'agency', 'Alexander', 'Knox', 'played', 'Control', 'miniseries', 'Knox', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'Knox', 'personified', 'death', 'warmed', 'burearocrat', 'utterly', 'exhausted', 'intra-agency', 'in-fighting', 'back', 'biting', 'Hurt', 'good', 'look', 'role', 'utterly', 'bored', 'job', 'not', 'exhausted.Toby', 'Jones', 'Percy', 'Adeline', 'usurper', 'Control', 'position', 'Michael', 'Aldridge', 'played', 'Adeline', 'miniseries', 'imbued', 'role', 'pomposity', 'arrogance', 'meance', 'Carre', 'intended', 'character.Mark', 'Strong', 'Jim', 'Prideaux', 'spy', 'who', 'was', 'nearly', 'murdered', 'mole', 'agency', 'Ian', 'Banner', 'played', 'Prideaux', 'original', 'miniseries', 'deftly', 'character', 'broken', 'shattered', 'spy', 'was', 'Strong', 'not', 'broken', 'shattered', 'catatonic.Oddly', 'enough', 'best', 'portrayal', 'lessor', 'character', 'Toby', 'Esterhasie', 'David', 'Dencik', 'brilliantly', 'character', 'sniveling', 'dog', 'Also', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'Ricki', 'Tarr', 'character', 'wrong-go', 'outcast', 'who', 'first', 'existence', 'mole', 'known.On', 'whole', 'however', 'actors', 'undoubtedly', 'attempted', 'portray', 'tedium', 'daily', 'grind', 'agency', 'What', 'resulted', 'was', 'group', 'actors', 'who', 'appeared', 'be', 'sleep-walking.Why', 'was', 'Oldman', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'role', 'No', 'doubt', 'was', 'result', 'collective', 'guilt', 'Academy', 'not', 'previously', 'nominating', 'actor', 'body', 'work', 'Lord', 'are', 'other', 'roles', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'will', 'be', 'nominated', 'soon', 'hopefully', 'win', 'statue', 'so', 'justly']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

1448180,A3G36QYR6PWME9,B0059XTTW8,Timothy P. Stallcup,"[2, 4]","Viewers' reactions to this movie must depend, in large part, on their expectations and their history with the novel and '70s era BBC miniseries.  Le Carre may be one of the great British novelists of the last 50 years who simply happened to mine the vein of espionage fiction and was at the peak of his powers, and ideally suited to deal with the Cold War milieu, in the ""Smiley Trilogy"": Tinker Tailor, Smiley's People and The Honourable Schoolboy.  If you are a fan of the novel, and watch the movie making constant comparisons, you will probably be disappointed. Le Carre's fiction is challenging, layered and deeply perceptive, and the events are intricately interwoven.  A two hour movie simply cannot convey all the novel has to offer, omits and changes certain significant details, merges characters, and did not, for me, convey the deep ambiguities and analysis of betrayal at the heart of the novel. The movie also failed to create a great deal of suspence.Likewise, a viewer who has recently seen the 1979 BBC miniseries starring Alec Guiness as George Smiley also will be disappointed. Guiness was terrific and managed to make of Smiley a much deeper and more complex character than does Gary Oldman in the time allotted to him. The cast of the miniseries also was brilliant, from Hywel Bennett as Ricki Tarr, through Ian Richardson, Bernard Hepton, Terence Rigby, Sian Phillips, Joss Ackland, Patrick Stewart, Ian Bannen, et al.  The miniseries was probably one of the best ever BBC productions and had the time (about 5.5 hours) to develop most all of the characters of the novel, explore its subtleties, and make sense of and explain the interconnectedness of the various strands of the plot that come together and allow Smiley to find the ""mole."" Again, if you watch the movie comparing it constantly to the miniseries, I think you will be disappointed. There is a lot left out, many of the characters are barely developed, Anne, Smiley's wife, doesn't appear at all, except obliquely in a few scenes, and the sense of mystery and drama in the miniseries is much greater--you are literally on the edge of your seat in the scene in which the traitor is unmasked.That being said, obviously, condensing the book to two hours must have been a daunting challenge, but the movie is still enjoyable and far from a failure. Gary Oldman is good as Smiley, but seems to play most of the movie in a passive state of shock.  Smiley is a damaged and conflicted man, beset by betrayal on all sides, but Oldman's protrayal is, for me, too strangely passive, and I don't think we get a feeling for what Smiley is all about.  Similarly, the other ""suspects,"" meaning the power elite at the Circus (British Intelligence), are well enough acted, but hardly developed at all. SPOILER ALERT  My main complaint has to do with one of the finer actors in the cast, Colin Firth, who plays Bill Haydon.  Haydon is supposed to be the ""golden boy"" of the Circus, the ""laughing cavalier"" whom the younger generation venerates and so talented and magnetic that, according to Prideaux (in the novel and miniseries) ""you just can't judge Bill by ordinary standards.""  Unfortunately, we really don't see enough of Haydon to understand the nature and magnitude of his betrayal.  It would be unfair, however, not to note that John Hurt is excellent as Control.I also have to wonder whether the movie will simply make sense to viewers who come unprepared. For example, we don't quite get the idea that the failed Hungarian gambit (why it has been changed from Czechoslovakia, I don't know) was Control's last ditch attempt to unmask the traitor, and I didn't find it clear in the movie how Tarr's final assignment was designed to flush out the traitor (very clear in the book and miniseries).  There are a host of other changes of which one could complain: the merging of Jerry Westerby and Sam Collins, the sexual orientation of Peter Guillam, the absence of Anne, the absence of Karla (instead of a scene between Smiley and Karla we get only Smiley's tale of their encounter).  --But of course I am inevitably comparing the movie with the other versions.All in all, if you have some background with the book or the miniseries, I think that comparisons will be inevitable and the movie certainly has not improved on either version.  At the same time, as thin as it sometimes is, the movie is worth watching. The acting is solid, there is enough suspence to keep things interesting, and the atmosphere is effective.  At the least, perhaps it will encourage viewers to read the book or watch the miniseries, both of which are excellent.",3,Depends on your expectations,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,4614,"['Viewers', 'reactions', 'movie', 'must', 'depend', 'large', 'part', 'expectations', 'history', 'novel', ""'70s"", 'era', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'Le', 'Carre', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'British', 'novelists', 'last', '50', 'years', 'who', 'simply', 'happened', 'mine', 'vein', 'espionage', 'fiction', 'was', 'peak', 'powers', 'ideally', 'suited', 'deal', 'Cold', 'War', 'milieu', 'Smiley', 'Trilogy', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Smiley', 'People', 'Honourable', 'Schoolboy', 'are', 'fan', 'novel', 'watch', 'movie', 'making', 'constant', 'comparisons', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Le', 'Carre', 'fiction', 'challenging', 'layered', 'deeply', 'perceptive', 'events', 'are', 'intricately', 'interwoven', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'convey', 'novel', 'offer', 'omits', 'changes', 'certain', 'significant', 'details', 'merges', 'characters', 'did', 'not', 'deep', 'ambiguities', 'analysis', 'betrayal', 'heart', 'novel', 'movie', 'also', 'failed', 'create', 'great', 'deal', 'suspence.Likewise', 'viewer', 'who', 'recently', 'seen', '1979', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'starring', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'George', 'Smiley', 'also', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Guiness', 'was', 'terrific', 'managed', 'make', 'Smiley', 'much', 'deeper', 'more', 'complex', 'character', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'time', 'allotted', 'cast', 'miniseries', 'also', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Hywel', 'Bennett', 'Ricki', 'Tarr', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'Bernard', 'Hepton', 'Terence', 'Rigby', 'Sian', 'Phillips', 'Joss', 'Ackland', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'Bannen', 'et', 'al', 'miniseries', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'BBC', 'productions', 'had', 'time', '5.5', 'hours', 'develop', 'most', 'characters', 'novel', 'explore', 'subtleties', 'make', 'sense', 'explain', 'interconnectedness', 'various', 'strands', 'plot', 'together', 'allow', 'Smiley', 'find', 'mole', 'Again', 'watch', 'movie', 'comparing', 'constantly', 'miniseries', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'lot', 'left', 'out', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'barely', 'developed', 'Anne', 'Smiley', 'wife', ""n't"", 'appear', 'obliquely', 'few', 'scenes', 'sense', 'mystery', 'drama', 'miniseries', 'much', 'greater', 'are', 'literally', 'edge', 'seat', 'scene', 'traitor', 'unmasked.That', 'being', 'said', 'obviously', 'condensing', 'book', 'two', 'hours', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'daunting', 'challenge', 'movie', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'far', 'failure', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'good', 'Smiley', 'play', 'most', 'movie', 'passive', 'state', 'shock', 'Smiley', 'damaged', 'conflicted', 'man', 'beset', 'betrayal', 'sides', 'Oldman', 'protrayal', 'too', 'strangely', 'passive', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'get', 'feeling', 'what', 'Smiley', 'Similarly', 'other', 'suspects', 'meaning', 'power', 'elite', 'Circus', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'are', 'well', 'enough', 'acted', 'hardly', 'developed', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'My', 'main', 'complaint', 'do', 'one', 'finer', 'actors', 'cast', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'who', 'Bill', 'Haydon', 'Haydon', 'supposed', 'be', 'golden', 'boy', 'Circus', 'laughing', 'cavalier', 'whom', 'younger', 'generation', 'venerates', 'so', 'talented', 'magnetic', 'according', 'Prideaux', 'novel', 'miniseries', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'Bill', 'ordinary', 'standards', 'Unfortunately', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'enough', 'Haydon', 'understand', 'nature', 'magnitude', 'betrayal', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'however', 'not', 'note', 'John', 'Hurt', 'excellent', 'Control.I', 'also', 'have', 'wonder', 'movie', 'will', 'simply', 'make', 'sense', 'viewers', 'who', 'come', 'unprepared', 'example', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'idea', 'failed', 'Hungarian', 'gambit', 'why', 'been', 'changed', 'Czechoslovakia', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'Control', 'last', 'ditch', 'attempt', 'unmask', 'traitor', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'clear', 'movie', 'how', 'Tarr', 'final', 'assignment', 'was', 'designed', 'flush', 'out', 'traitor', 'very', 'clear', 'book', 'miniseries', 'are', 'host', 'other', 'changes', 'one', 'could', 'complain', 'merging', 'Jerry', 'Westerby', 'Sam', 'Collins', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'Peter', 'Guillam', 'absence', 'Anne', 'absence', 'Karla', 'instead', 'scene', 'Smiley', 'Karla', 'get', 'only', 'Smiley', 'tale', 'encounter', 'course', 'am', 'inevitably', 'comparing', 'movie', 'other', 'versions.All', 'have', 'background', 'book', 'miniseries', 'think', 'comparisons', 'will', 'be', 'inevitable', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'improved', 'version', 'same', 'time', 'as', 'thin', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'acting', 'solid', 'enough', 'suspence', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'atmosphere', 'effective', 'least', 'perhaps', 'will', 'encourage', 'viewers', 'read', 'book', 'watch', 'miniseries', 'are', 'excellent']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

They are pensive ruminations on betrayal, loyalty, and duty with respect to one's family, friends, colleagues, country, and ideals.When I first heard that a movie adaptation was being made, I simply wondered ""Why?"". The definitive 1979 adaptationTinker Tailor Soldier Spy, a TV mini-series, simply can't be improved. And anyway, Oldman looks so different from Alec Guinness's George Smiley that I thought it would ruin the film. Fortunately it doesn't; in fact Oldman makes the movie.Simply from his choice of profession, we know that George Smiley must necessarily do evil things. Alec Guinness's Smiley shows his sinister side only once or twice in the mini-series, for example when he is questioning Ricki Tarr, he gives Tarr a very menacing look as he puts on his glasses.Gary Oldman's George Smiley on the other hand oozes evil. George Smiley does evil because his job requires him to do the dirty work his government and his ideals command him to do. George Smiley does evil because in most cases doing nothing would result in a greater evil. Smiley chooses the lesser evil. No good man can live with this easily. Gary Oldman hardly ever appears kind or gentle. He bullies Connie Sachs with a bottle of whisky. He terrifies Toby Esterhase into tears. When he takes charge of something, he displays no satisfaction at being proven right. It's not generosity, it's simply an absence of any good feeling.I finally realized that Alec Guinness is NOT George Smiley. He comes damn close but Smiley is a far more complex character that can be portrayed by a single actor in a single performance. Oldman does not offer a new interpretation of George Smiley, he presents a different side of the spy master, the necessary evil inner side hidden under the gentler face Guinness showed us.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo",5,The dark side of George Smiley,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",2012,1865,"['John', 'Le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'spy', 'novels', 'are', 'not', 'simple', 'pot', 'boilers', 'are', 'pensive', 'ruminations', 'betrayal', 'loyalty', 'duty', 'respect', 'one', 'family', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'country', 'ideals.When', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'simply', 'wondered', 'Why', 'definitive', '1979', 'adaptationTinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'improved', 'anyway', 'Oldman', 'so', 'different', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'George', 'Smiley', 'thought', 'would', 'ruin', 'film', 'Fortunately', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Oldman', 'movie.Simply', 'choice', 'profession', 'know', 'George', 'Smiley', 'must', 'necessarily', 'do', 'evil', 'things', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'Smiley', 'sinister', 'side', 'only', 'once', 'twice', 'mini-series', 'example', 'when', 'questioning', 'Ricki', 'Tarr', 'Tarr', 'very', 'menacing', 'look', 'glasses.Gary', 'Oldman', 'George', 'Smiley', 'other', 'hand', 'evil', 'George', 'Smiley', 'evil', 'job', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'government', 'ideals', 'command', 'do', 'George', 'Smiley', 'evil', 'most', 'cases', 'doing', 'nothing', 'would', 'result', 'greater', 'evil', 'Smiley', 'lesser', 'evil', 'good', 'man', 'can', 'live', 'easily', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'hardly', 'ever', 'kind', 'gentle', 'Connie', 'Sachs', 'bottle', 'whisky', 'Toby', 'Esterhase', 'tears', 'When', 'charge', 'something', 'satisfaction', 'being', 'proven', 'right', 'not', 'generosity', 'simply', 'absence', 'good', 'feeling.I', 'finally', 'realized', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'NOT', 'George', 'Smiley', 'damn', 'close', 'Smiley', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'portrayed', 'single', 'actor', 'single', 'performance', 'Oldman', 'not', 'offer', 'new', 'interpretation', 'George', 'Smiley', 'different', 'side', 'spy', 'master', 'necessary', 'evil', 'inner', 'side', 'hidden', 'gentler', 'face', 'Guinness', 'showed', 'us.Vincent', 'Poirier', 'Tokyo']","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"

George Smiley commands attention and respect by saying nothing. His enigmatic expression telling us...nothing. Gary Oldman deserved his Academy Award nomination for his performance in ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" which equals the outstanding performance by the late Alec Guinness in the TV adaptation from the 1980's step-for-step and establishes that performance as unique. Oldman's challenge was akin to Dustin Hoffman's in playing the lead in ""Death of A Salesman"" after the Academy Award winning performance by Lee J. Cobb for the original film version. In other words, it was near impossible, scary and just this side of crazy.Just be aware that the film is a bit slow in terms of pacing compared to most contemporary Hollywood spy movies and thrillers. ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" returns to a the slower paced spy thrillers like we saw in the 1970's which is interesting given that it takes place in 1973. You need to be prepared that this film is convoluted without the rapid cutting style films typical display today. Patience is rewarded as is paying attention to this thriller which jumps back in forth in time.It's 1973. George Smiley (Oldman) one of the leaders of MI6 and trusted ally of Control (John Hurt) finds himself dismissed after a meeting goes awry with an operative (the always marvelous Mark Strong) behind the iron curtain. After Control's accidental death he's brought back into the ""Circus"" (as MI6 is referred to) to uncover a double agent high within the command structure of the organization. Smiley must wade through the sewage of double and triple crosses, misleading clues and red herrings and try and protect one operative (Tom Hardy) that has been accused by the other department heads within the ""Circus"" (Toby Jones, Colin Firth, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, Devid Dencik).""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" receives a sharp, detailed transfer with muted colors reflecting the ""look"" of 1970's films while still capturing the look of higher resolution newer films. Reportedly, this doesn't look quite as good as the UK release but I can't comment because I haven't seen it to compare.Audio sounds terrific with a nice loss less presentation but keep in mind it isn't all that active as this is primarily a dialogue driven film.I have mixed feelings about the special features. We get Q&A; with the actors about the film and while interesting, it would have been far more rewarding to have a roundtable discussion with the actors. We do get a pretty engaging commentary track by star Oldman and director Tomas Alfredson giving us quite a bit of background on the making of the film.We also get a short promotional featurette on the production of the film that runs under 15 minutes as well as about 7 minutes of deleted scenes. We don't, surprisingly, get the theatrical trailer.""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is the type of thriller that rewards the patient viewer and it's a strong, well made movie. Goldman's performance is the center piece of the film but he's strongly supported by a terrific cast of brilliant character actors.

Both the movie and TV production have great actors, but the acting in the BBC series is superior (Alec Guinness, Ian Richardson, etc.) and, being three times longer in length,  the series has time to draw the complicated story out more successfully. Even then, the brilliantly acted and filmed mini-series is complicated and is better understood and appreciated if one watches it a couple of times after reading the book.I don't believe someone who has no familiarity with the story can watch this 2 hour movie without being confused about the plot. For me, having read the book and seen the BBC version two or three times, the movie was rather disappointing.Partly because of the problem of the story being too condensed, the viewer has to be able to pick up details in the plot very quickly, and remember them well, or he/she will be completely lost. This relates, in part, to a number of flashbacks that could be very confusing.I also thought some of the changes made in the plot for the movie (apparently to save time) were less plausible than the BBC and book versions. For example, in the movie, government official Oliver Lacon appears to launch an investigation of British Intelligence solely based on a phone call from a stranger named Ricki Tarr who tells him he works under agent Peter Guillam and that ""The Circus"" (British Intelligence, MI5) has a mole. Without even checking with Guillam (who, by the way, would have denounced Tarr as a traitor unless he could be convinced otherwise), Lacon calls George Smiley in and initiates an unofficial investigation. At least the BBC has Lacon, Guillam and Smiley talk things through with Tarr before Smiley is asked to find the mole. And threatening to fly Toby Esterhase back to Europe and drop him off (apparently to face arrest due to outstanding warrants) in order to get him to cooperate with Smiley and reveal the address of the safe house seemed a bit much to me.Included with the DVD version of the movie is a bonus feature of scenes that were cut. These are not worth watching and I am surprised they were added to the DVD.

Mass democracy, better grasped as government by talk, obscures the truth taught by Rabbi Avigdor Miller of blessed memory - ""It is the quiet man that is respected."" There is a Soviet mole in the British intelligence service (""The Circus"") but somehow we just know it's not George Smiley (played by Oldman). Too much gravitas. Smiley earns his gravitas by saying little and doing much (Shammai. Pirkei Avos 1:15). Thank you, Mr. Oldman, for proving the rebbe correct.""Tinker, Tailor"" is full of the ambiguity and dead-pan humor that le Carre has been gifting to readers for nearly three generations (2013 will mark the 50th anniversary of ""The Spy That Came in From the Cold""). The author being one of the film's executive producers guarantees full injection of the book's best touches. Bureaucracy and camaraderie prove useful devices. The humor even registers in the names - Control (played strongly by John Hurt) is losing control of The Circus and Smiley doesn't smile. Le Carre uses an Anton Chekov-type pen in showing that Control and Smiley have hurt themselves as much as been hurt by others (Control with his inner circle, Smiley with his wife). Fittingly, they're run out of The Circus at the same time.Having had his one illusion shattered through Ann's infidelity, Smiley is the best equipped to find the mole. Swimming in the brackish water without removing his glasses is wonderful metaphor for Smiley's abilities and realism.Smiley's recollection of Karla is another compelling dive into realism. With the help of some drink, he concedes the brilliance of his adversary in noting that Karla carries a non-memorable face, a great asset in the spy game. Smiley admits Karla has a piece of him through possession of a cigarette lighter (""For George. Love, Ann""), hinting that Smiley's work nudged Ann toward infidelity. As viewers inhale deep thinking Smiley might be the mole, our hero quickly exhales for us in proclaiming Karla can be beaten because he's a fanatic. By extension, le Carre is saying an ideology state cannot last. He's predicting the fall of the Iron Curtain. That was quite a thing to write in 1973, the era of d&eacute;tente. But le Carre has long been able to see further than most.Smiley and Karla rings a faint bell of bisexualism, another thing hardly considered in 1973. But take the notion of bisexualism and look at it through le Carre's long lens and you'll see the mole.Le Carre sports with the other giant of British spy fiction, Ian Fleming. Like Fleming's James Bond, Smiley also has a Walther pistol. But Smiley carries his around in a plastic bag like it's a dead rat.The UK's diminishment to proxy surfaces when it becomes clear what Karla is up to. Moscow is using London to get at Washington. Smiley bursts the bubble of the UK minister, who has the good grace to realize Her Majesty's Government has been a tool. If there's a flag-waving neocon faction in British politics, le Carre clearly doesn't belong to it.Silence becomes less prevalent as Smiley gets closer to discovering the mole.

1448202,A3GJS1MZAIRP8L,B0059XTTW8,Y. Saavedra,"[1, 3]","After listening to John Le Carre's opinions on this movie, I wonder if we watched the same movie. Maybe because he lived it he could see grand canyon deep into the characters, because I found them all pretty awful, and many of the actors I like. At the end of the movie I didn't care if any one of them lived or died.The constant extremely slow panning showing the horrible sets and scenery was annoying and pointless.They must have paid a bargain basement price for the wigs, hair pieces and hair coloring jobs. The orange hue on three main characters was very distracting and looked like the job of a very amateur hair stylist.At least in this version, one doesn't need to read the book or a wiki synopsis to know what's going on or who all the characters are, but the characters are much richer developed in the version with Alec Guinness.At the beginning of the movie after a botched undercover mission that Control (the leader) set up, Control in a meeting with other main characters, resigns and says Smiley's leaving with him. What?William Hurt portrayed Control as a lunatic.Gary Oldman says his lines in an incredibly robotic manner and tone as do all the other actors.Both versions according to Le Carre show a realistic view of the espionage world. Neither certainly glamorizes the spy world as American movies and tv do. They also show the huge waste of taxpayers' money and no true accountability, because it's important, secret work, how can one expect accountability when it comes to safety, huh?

Its the early 70s, and the two superpowers are at a stand-still. Past the heated early days of the cold war where Russia and the US were racing to gain a territorial or weapons advantage. At this time the lines have been drawn and it has set in that both superpowers are roughly equal in terms of military power. This is the long slog. A time when a mild manored and good wwii vet can make a difference.The plot is simple. A mole has made it to the top of the British intelligence service and it is one of four people. It is the job of our hero George Smiley to determine who. But throwing out accusations against top level civil servants is something that can not be done lightly and George will only come calling when he has the man red handed. If it was a matter just of guessing then anyone could do it. Only a man of his temperament and skill could accomplish this and that is why the under-secretary has tasked him with this mission.I think a word of caution, everything is on the screen... but don't expect to see it. This is a world of nuance and the clues don't jump up and down and say here I am. This film isn't a who done it. The question is why, and when you know why. The actors become more clear and a soft spot In the plan becomes visible. Push the right buttons and the mole will reveal himself.That being said if you expect to 'figure it out' this movie will simply leave you frustrated.  I don't think that you really have a chance of understanding the whys unless you have read the book.
