999433,A36QOKGQK2DG8V,B000G8NXZ0,Adventure Fan,"[3, 29]","THE MOVIEI haven't watched a movie this tediously boring since Spiderman 3. I rented this because the reviews promised comedy greatness and video transfer greatness. My wife and I found Playtime plotless, magicless, comedyless. We almost couldn't finish it. Obviously many people love this film, but it's just not an experience to my taste. In the end, am I glad that I at least gave it a chance? No. I wish I could go back in time, read my own review, and then netflix something else.THE BLU-RAYIt's a 40 year old french film shot on 70mm. Maybe this is what a ""5-star"" transfer of a really old movie looks like, but it only looks average compared to a 5-star transfer of a modern movie on blu-ray. The video quality doesn't even come close to The Dark Knight imax sequences or something like Baraka, which was also 70mm but fantastically impressive. This might be the best this movie has ever looked, but it doesn't have any wow-factor. Any good dvd, upscaled to 1080p, looks equal to and sometimes better than this blu-ray did on my 50"" plasma.",2,"Solid Blu-ray, Tediously Boring French ""Art Film""",1251763200,"09 1, 2009",2009,1047,"['MOVIEI', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'movie', 'tediously', 'boring', 'Spiderman', '3', 'rented', 'reviews', 'promised', 'comedy', 'greatness', 'video', 'transfer', 'greatness', 'wife', 'found', 'Playtime', 'plotless', 'magicless', 'comedyless', 'almost', 'could', ""n't"", 'finish', 'Obviously', 'many', 'people', 'love', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'experience', 'taste', 'end', 'am', 'glad', 'least', 'gave', 'chance', 'No', 'wish', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'read', 'own', 'review', 'then', 'netflix', 'something', 'else.THE', 'BLU-RAYIt', '40', 'year', 'old', 'french', 'film', 'shot', '70mm', 'Maybe', 'what', '5-star', 'transfer', 'really', 'old', 'movie', 'only', 'average', 'compared', '5-star', 'transfer', 'modern', 'movie', 'blu-ray', 'video', 'quality', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'imax', 'sequences', 'something', 'Baraka', 'was', 'also', '70mm', 'fantastically', 'impressive', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'looked', ""n't"", 'have', 'wow-factor', 'good', 'dvd', 'upscaled', '1080p', 'equal', 'sometimes', 'better', 'blu-ray', 'did', '50', 'plasma']",N/A
999434,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000G8NXZ0,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","`Playtime' is not a film for everyone so please be forewarned that my praising of this film may or may not mirror your sentiments if you ever decide to see this picture.  `Playtime' is what I like to call an observational film.  This is a picture that says a lot without ever really saying anything.  The dialog is limited to overheard conversations and brief character interactions and is best thought of as background noise.  In fact, Jacques Tati's moving film is best described as Robert Altman meets Charlie Chaplin; a moderately comedic film that lives and breathes within the audience's interpretation of the proceedings.If ever a film defined the phrase `beauty is in the eye of the beholder', this is it.The film is really, plot wise, about nothing.  A man (Tati's comedic alter ego Monsieur Hulot) is trying desperately to make an appointment.  Along the way he observes all that his beloved city has become.  That is it; but that is all it needs to be.The key to understanding and enjoying this film is by merely allowing yourself to watch without anticipation.  Nothing that happens on the screen has any apparent significance but it is presented in order to reach you.  The only way that this can happen is if you allow yourself to take it in and to contemplate its deeper meaning as is intended.  What Tati was attempting to show us was the way in which we are affected so deeply by the changes in modern society.  The film has even more significance today as we watch our present world changing before our very eyes.  What is so stunning about Tati's final film is that it manages to provide insight to the viewer; a deeper understanding of things that he or she probably feels pretty sure of already.As society becomes more and more fascinated with marketing itself they become less and less interested and simply living.  Everything is done for the enjoyment of others; to make attract others and make them fascinated and comfortable; but in this action we give up who we are.  We lose our honesty to a world of commercialism and thus become one in a million.There is no individuality anymore.Like I mentioned; this is not for everyone.  Some may very well miss the point, and yet others who get the point may feel it is delivered in a less than conventional manor.  That is true, for the films delivery is what may turn some off (like I stated, it seems to have no point).  If you are interested in embracing a film for its artistic insight though, this is a film you will want to get your hands on.  It's enlightening, intriguing and unforgettable.",5,Sometimes we cannot see what is right in front of our nose...,1235692800,"02 27, 2009",2009,2567,"['Playtime', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'so', 'please', 'be', 'forewarned', 'praising', 'film', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'mirror', 'sentiments', 'ever', 'decide', 'see', 'picture', 'Playtime', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'observational', 'film', 'picture', 'lot', 'ever', 'really', 'saying', 'anything', 'dialog', 'limited', 'overheard', 'conversations', 'brief', 'character', 'interactions', 'best', 'thought', 'background', 'noise', 'fact', 'Jacques', 'Tati', 'moving', 'film', 'best', 'described', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'moderately', 'comedic', 'film', 'breathes', 'audience', 'interpretation', 'proceedings.If', 'ever', 'film', 'defined', 'phrase', 'beauty', 'eye', 'beholder', 'it.The', 'film', 'really', 'plot', 'wise', 'nothing', 'man', 'Tati', 'comedic', 'alter', 'ego', 'Monsieur', 'Hulot', 'trying', 'desperately', 'make', 'appointment', 'way', 'beloved', 'city', 'become', 'be.The', 'key', 'understanding', 'enjoying', 'film', 'merely', 'allowing', 'watch', 'anticipation', 'Nothing', 'screen', 'apparent', 'significance', 'presented', 'order', 'reach', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'happen', 'allow', 'take', 'contemplate', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'intended', 'What', 'Tati', 'was', 'attempting', 'show', 'was', 'way', 'are', 'affected', 'so', 'deeply', 'changes', 'modern', 'society', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'significance', 'today', 'watch', 'present', 'world', 'changing', 'very', 'eyes', 'What', 'so', 'stunning', 'Tati', 'final', 'film', 'provide', 'insight', 'viewer', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'things', 'probably', 'pretty', 'sure', 'already.As', 'society', 'more', 'more', 'fascinated', 'marketing', 'become', 'less', 'less', 'interested', 'simply', 'living', 'Everything', 'done', 'enjoyment', 'others', 'make', 'attract', 'others', 'make', 'fascinated', 'comfortable', 'action', 'give', 'up', 'who', 'are', 'lose', 'honesty', 'world', 'commercialism', 'thus', 'become', 'one', 'million.There', 'individuality', 'mentioned', 'not', 'everyone', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'miss', 'point', 'yet', 'others', 'who', 'get', 'point', 'may', 'feel', 'delivered', 'less', 'conventional', 'manor', 'true', 'films', 'delivery', 'what', 'may', 'turn', 'off', 'stated', 'have', 'point', 'are', 'interested', 'embracing', 'film', 'artistic', 'insight', 'film', 'will', 'want', 'get', 'hands', 'enlightening', 'intriguing', 'unforgettable']",N/A
999435,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000G8NXZ0,C. O. DeRiemer,"[55, 58]","Why was Playtime a failure, sending Jacques Tati into bankruptcy and costing him control over his life's work of films? His previous film, My Uncle, had been a commercial and artistic success. M. Hulot's Holiday and Jour de Fete had gained Tati world-wide recognition and respect. He had become recognized as one of the few authentic geniuses of film.Watch Playtime and I think you'll find the answer. Tati in his earlier films placed Hulot in situations where we could empathize with him. Hulot was an innocent. As we came to like him, we also came to like the people he encountered. Even with their pretensions and idiosyncrasies, we could see something of ourselves in them. Tati might be holding up a mirror for us to look in, but M. Hulot was such a gentle companion that we smiled as we recognized ourselves.With Playtime, there is little Hulot. Instead, we have Tati's view on all sorts of social and cultural issues, from the sterility he saw in much of modern life to modern architecture, group behavior, impersonal offices, loneliness, boorishness and American tourists. We're observers, and our job is to share Tati's viewpoint. Hulot, now middle-aged, has become a minor player in the film. In his earlier movies, Tati was careful to give us small numbers of people with whom, along with Hulot, we could come to know. In My Uncle, for instance, it was essentially one family and one modern home, along with Hulot's own apartment and his neighbors. In M. Hulot's Holiday, it was a small seaside hotel and its guests. With Playtime, we have a large, impersonal office building, all glass and right angles, filled with people -- employees, visitors, exposition guests, customers. Then we have an apartment building with huge curtain-less windows allowing the pedestrians to look right in, and we're among the pedestrians. Then we have a nightclub filled with customers, waiters and managers. There is little opportunity to get to know any of these people, much less develop affection for them.However, as with all his movies, Tati fills Playtime with streams of intricate and carefully developed comic situations (although comic is too broad a term), often that build from small happenings we've barely noticed. There is only sporadic and incidental dialogue, but sound effects are vital to the movie, as subtle and amusing as what we see.As sterile and unattractive as Tati makes the airport, the office building, a convenience store and the apartment, there are such odd and subtle sights as the bobbing wimple wings on two nuns, a floor sweeper staring at a booted officer, Hulot suddenly sliding down a floor, glass windows and doors impossible to tell if they're there or not, a table lamp that dispenses cigarettes, strange-looking and wobbling food at a self-service counter...and the list simply goes on. And it's not just one thing at a time. Tati can fill a screen with all sorts of amusing occurrences, some happening in the foreground, some in back, some at the sides.The last hour of the movie takes place in a modern nightclub, the Royal Garden, which has just opened and is barely ready for its customers. A dance floor tile sticks to a maitre d's shoe, a fish is ostentatiously finished table-side by a waiter...then finished again and again by mistake while the two customers ooh and ah. A bow tie falls in the sauce. A bus-load of tourists suddenly appear. When Hulot manages to accidently shatter one of the glass doors to the restaurant, it is a culmination to all those glass walls we've been looking through and walking into. The follow-up gag with the round door opener is almost worth the price of the DVD. As the modern restaurant gradually disintegrates around us, Tati finally begins to ease up on personal viewpoints and let's us simply enjoy the sight of people becoming more like people. And that, I suspect, is the point Tati wanted to make. In an odd sort of way, the last ten minutes evoke the humor and warmth of previous Tati movies...a packed traffic circle with all the cars moving slowly together; a father taking a toy horn from his little boy and blowing it, too; the bittersweet last look at Hulot walking past a bus where a young woman he met at the nightclub is being taken to the airport with her tourist group.If you like Tati's viewpoint on the impersonalization of modern society, you'll probably like Playtime. Some critics call it his masterpiece. If you like Tati, I think Playtime is essential, if only to understand what happened to him. The movie is an idiosyncratic and gallant failure, in my view, and much too long. Still, I'd rather watch Playtime than most of what passes as genius in films today.The new Criterion release looks very good. This edition has several extra features including supplements about Tati and an audio interview with him. The case also contains an insert with an essay by Jonathan Rosenbaum, identified as a film critic.",4,"Whether it's a masterpiece or a failure or both, Playtime remains an essential Tati

999439,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000G8NXZ0,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[18, 18]","French director Jacques Tati is considered as one of the best directors of all time.  Known for his comedic work in France, his character Monsieur Hulot has appeared in several successful comedic films such as ""Juor de Fete"", M. Hulot's Holday"", ""Mon Oncle"", ""Traffic"" but there is one film that will be his accolade.  That film is ""Playtime"".Considered a masterpiece by critics, the film was also a commercial failure and was the most expensive film ever created in France as Tati created a set featuring a whole city block with high rise buildings that looked incredibly real.  But the film was ahead of its time.""Playtime"" is a visual film with no significant plot, nor does it have much dialogue.  It's a film that is driven by its many characters onscreen and the elaborate setup as characters, buildings and vehicles are treated with so much detail on the film, that it just a feast for ones easy as Tati absolutely created a film that was sheer brilliance.But part of the problem was his risky gamble on 70 mm widescreen and stereophonic sound.  Many theaters were not equipped to handle that and to make things worse (but understandable) is the lack of dialogue which can easily turn off audiences.  So, needless to say, the film didn't do well in France and also in America.It's after Tati died in 1982, is when people found admiration in his work and seeing how his films were truly amazing.""Playtime"" is like a smorgasbord of life being changed by modern technology and as Tati was known to do, lambast modern society as he was a man that was definitely ""old school"" to the time of his death.The film revolves around Tati's famous character Monsieur Hulot and an American tourist named Barbara.For Monsieur Hulot, he easily gets lost in the city and leads him to adventures to various areas such as an office building (which he had a problem with today's modern architecture) as he gets lost trying to get to his meeting and ends up being pulled away to a high-tech trade expedition, a high-tech apartment and then leads him to nightclub known as the Royal Guarden.As for Barbara, she just wants to experience the beauty of Paris.  She accompanies her (loud) American friends but she rather enjoy France her own way.  Obviously Barbara had different ideas in mind of Paris but instead she receives a modernize setting.The film culminates with the carousel of cars as Barbara must leave the city and sees almost a carousel/parade of all these vehicles all around her and how all the people react.  What we see is a city that has been transformed to a festive, enormous metropolitan playground.""Playtime"" focuses on these two characters (and other characters who shows up more than once), Tati showcases modernization (which looks beautiful) but it's that demolishing of the France that he loves and now getting used to this new France is what makes ""Playtime"" quite entertaining.Viewers can watch ""Playtime"" with its original French audio but also an International version which features the film in English.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Playtime"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 Aspect Ratio).

A great audio recording that gives us insight of  Jacques Tati.* Video interview with script supervisor Sylvette Baudrot - (12:09) Sylvette Baudrot talks about working on the film and reveals some secrets of how Tati made this film work.* Cours du soir, a 1967 short film written by and starring Tati - (27:41) A short film in which features Tati teaching a mime class.Also, included is an essay (in the insert) by Jonathan Rosenbaum (a film critic for the Chicago Reader from 1987-2000) titled ""The Dance of Playtime"".JUDGMENT CALL:""Playtime"" happened to be the first Jacques Tati film that I have ever watched.  I was familiar with his character of M. Hulot but for years, I have wanted to watch and experience the film.The first thing that I found surprising is the attention to detail as the unbelievable set Tati's company had created was just fantastic.  The buildings look modern, the set looks like a major section of Paris with all the people, buildings and vehicles.  And sure enough, ""Playtime"" is a film that utilizes everything on screen to show how modern technology has literally chanted the landscape. Some who embrace the changes and convenience of modernization and some who feel they are left behind and are literally lost.What makes this film work outside of its incredible set is that Tati is a perfectionist.  He literally directs each person in the film.  Everyone has an import part to play. May it be how characters have this choreographed walk as they go off in several directions to characters at a restaurant as we see people dancing on the dance floor, each person dancing differently.  While servants are trying to get the food out and you see visual gags as one servant clearly has their eyes on something inside the club, while another is attentive to the female patrons and those who are desperately trying to get their food out.  It may seem chaotic, but Tati knows what he wanted to get onscreen and succeeds.""Playtime"" features absolutely beautiful cinematography as we see bungalows on the work floor which work almost like a maze.  We see buildings that appear to be metallic and the lighting automatically synchronizing when they turn on.  We see vehicles move almost in synch with other vehicles.We see people throughout the city in similar routines at work, we see people promoting the latest in modern technology ala the late 60's and what is most amazing is that there is hardly any dialogue.  It's like you are given an upfront look at how life is in the city and seeing how various people react to each other.The film plays out quite interesting as the first half is dedicated to various characters such as M. Hulot who has a business meeting but ends up getting lost in all the modern settings.  Barbara is a tourist who has accompanied several American women to Paris and finds the city to be quite breathtaking. We see Monsieur Hulot getting lost in offices from buildings that look alike.But then the second half of the film focuses on a nightclub known as The Royal Garden that is opening and yet not ready.  We see how the builders and the restaurant staff prepare for their major night despite the nightclub not yet ready.  Where the first half was quite visual, the second half focuses more intimately on the people of the nightclub and the film becomes more gag-driven but yet with so many people in the film, Tati did a wonderful job in making sure each character had some part in the film and contributed in some fun or hilarious way.A visual  film without dialogue may seem boring and monotonous but fortunately Jacques Tati included a good number of gags to make the whole 124 minutes a bit lively.  I did feel the film went a little long and that scenes could have been cut but with Jacques Tati putting all his energy into this film, I understand how difficult it was for him to even cut any scene out.  But I do feel that the film could have been much shorter but then again, I would have been curious to see Tati's original, longer cut.If anything, I really enjoyed what Tati did to create such a beautiful film.  Three years of his life and also the crew and talent who made this film a reality is very much appreciated as I was entertained visually and I just felt so much respect for Tati after the film was completed.  I did find it a bit disheartening to learn how this film which cost over $15 million (which was incredible for 1967 and was the most expensive French film at the time) caused problems for Tati as he was left bankrupt and unfortunately damaged his career.  As much as it was critically well-received, it was a failure in the box office but partly that was because Tati chose 70 mm instead of 35 mm  and Stereophonic sound which many theaters were not equipped to play during that time.The Criterion Collection really did a great job in presenting ""Playtime"" on Blu-ray.  The film looked absolutely beautiful for a film that is over 40 years old and because this film and what takes place onscreen is so immense that each time you watch this film, you will see things that you just didn't catch the first time.  You can't help be amazed of how Tati and crew were able to create a modernized city.  Tati made sure to really utilize his large cast in this film and what you see maybe different from what others are seeing because there are many things going on in the background.  So, definitely a film that I have no doubt will require multiple rewinds because too much is happening in one sitting.Also, The Criterion Collection edition of ""Playtime"" on Blu-ray features many special features that Jacques Tati fans will enjoy.I've heard that the film is a statement by Tati of how much society has changed along with the city he has loved.  The modernization with the use of electronics in buildings and restaurants and just making sure he has enough gags to make the audience laugh.  If only Tati can see how much has changed today, that would definitely be an entertaining script.A film that showcases beauty in various ways.  This is absolute a film that was the highlight of Jacques Tati's career and despite how this film may have done in the box office, anyone watching now and seeing what the director was able to accomplish with no discernible plot and very little dialogue is fantastic.  And again, the visuals are just fantastic.  I was really blown away with how beautiful and intricate of a film ""Playtime"" truly is.""Playtime"" is highly recommended!",5,"Blu-ray: I absolutely love this film!

999444,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B000G8NXZ0,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[3, 4]","This is Jacques Tati's masterwork.  I have yet to see it in a theater (I should, considering it was shot in 70mm), but the DVD is spectacular.  I had the original Criterion edition, but despite the fact I could have sold it on Ebay for a ridiculous amount of cash, I didn't, because I love this film.  This film is really a marvel, because it's so visually and aurally complex, that you can watch it over and over again, and see many new things each time.  It's a completely different film every time.  The film has to be seen on DVD or at the theater, because of the immaculate detail.  Everyone that appears in the film is actually doing something.  There are no superfluous extras just walking around.  Some actors whom you may think are extras appear later in the film and become main characters.  It seems that Tati himself gave everyone direction.  The final half of the film (the destruction of the restaurant) is one of the great setpieces in cinema history.  It's brilliantly assembled.  Tati was the Kubrick of France in many ways.  He only completed 6 features (Jour de Fete, Mr. Hulot's Holiday, Mon Oncle, Playtime, Trafic, and Parade), and a few shorts.  His attention to detail here is just astounding.  The city here is an actual set built for the film, which the press dubbed ""Tativille"".  Sadly, the film went way over budget (Tati's perfectionism, bad weather which destroyed much of the set), and was a major commercial failure.  This drove Tati into bankruptcy.

999451,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000G8NXZ0,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 12]","Jacques Tati's follow up toMon Oncle - Criterion Collectionis a wonderful looking film with a central theme of alienation. At the center of it is Tati's Monsieur Hulot who feels completely out of place in modern day France amidst the revealing architecture and the hustle of crowds, etc. While Mon Oncle and its predecessorM. Hulot's Holiday - Criterion Collectionboth fell into the sort of slapstick sub-genre, Playtime has a more serious tone to it. Although it does have enough sight gags to fill an almost unbearable 2 hour, 4 minute running time.I'm just going to flat-out say it right here. Playtime is a bit boring. In making a film about alienation (to a certain extent), Tati deliberate alienates much of his audience. Sometimes it works, mostly it doesn't. In one particular scene, Hulot runs into an old friend and joins the man in his apartment. The camera remains outside allowing us no insight into the ensuing conversation. The brilliant, yet very long, sequence that follows has the inhabitants of two apartments watching TV. This scene is brilliantly staged, choreographed, and shot. It just wears out its welcome.I guess the biggest problem with Playtime is its plot. Any attempt I could make at describing it would be futile because it doesn't exist. Arguably, the same could be said for the first two films as well but here, the lack of plot is what breaks the film.Anyone looking for another ""Holiday,"" will be disappointed, as the Hulot character takes a backseat to this story. His presence is not just largely absent, but largely missed in the opinion of this viewer.Don't fret Playtime fans. I do have some positive things to say about it.The film is very well-made and very elaborate. The sheer architecture of the set design is exquisite. Beyond that, Tati's uses of reflection to reinforce his themes are simply brilliant. Another thing I rarely pay attention too that stood out in this film was the sound. The use of sound and sound editing in this film is complex and brilliantly structured. There isn't a quiet scene in the entire film. There is always the eternal buzzing, humming, ticking, whirring, and wheezing of modern technology. All these sounds are used to remarkable effect.The sight gags in this film are also very articulate and (sometimes) quite amusing. The scene (and several scenes that follow it) in which Hulot breaks a restaurant's glass door and the doorman uses the handle to continue ""opening"" the door for people is brilliant. Tati seems like he would've been very comfortable and possibly even much more at home in the silent medium.Playtime has many characteristics that could sway one to call it brilliant. It's true that much of the film does bare pure brilliance. However, some editing I think would've done the film good. You can't judge the quality of a film based on its entertainment value, especially a film like this which is so terrific in so many other areas. However, my lack of being entertained made the film seem inferior to the other Hulot-stories, which in many ways it is.Large portions of Playtime move at such a snail's pace, I found myself zoning out through entire passages of the movie.I don't think Playtime is a C-film; it's just not a film I can see myself watching again.GRADE: C",3,"Extraordinarily Well-Made, But A Bit of a Failure",1239148800,"04 8, 2009",2009,3262,"['Jacques', 'Tati', 'follow', 'up', 'toMon', 'Oncle', 'Criterion', 'Collectionis', 'wonderful', 'looking', 'film', 'central', 'theme', 'alienation', 'center', 'Tati', 'Monsieur', 'Hulot', 'who', 'completely', 'place', 'modern', 'day', 'France', 'amidst', 'revealing', 'architecture', 'hustle', 'crowds', 'etc', 'Mon', 'Oncle', 'predecessorM', 'Hulot', 'Holiday', 'Criterion', 'Collectionboth', 'fell', 'sort', 'slapstick', 'sub-genre', 'Playtime', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'have', 'enough', 'sight', 'gags', 'fill', 'almost', 'unbearable', '2', 'hour', '4', 'minute', 'running', 'time.I', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'flat-out', 'say', 'right', 'here', 'Playtime', 'bit', 'boring', 'making', 'film', 'alienation', 'certain', 'extent', 'Tati', 'deliberate', 'alienates', 'much', 'audience', 'mostly', ""n't"", 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'Hulot', 'old', 'friend', 'man', 'apartment', 'camera', 'outside', 'allowing', 'insight', 'ensuing', 'conversation', 'brilliant', 'yet', 'very', 'long', 'sequence', 'inhabitants', 'two', 'apartments', 'watching', 'TV', 'scene', 'brilliantly', 'staged', 'choreographed', 'shot', 'just', 'out', 'welcome.I', 'guess', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Playtime', 'plot', 'attempt', 'could', 'make', 'describing', 'would', 'be', 'futile', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Arguably', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'well', 'here', 'lack', 'plot', 'what', 'film.Anyone', 'looking', 'Holiday', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Hulot', 'character', 'backseat', 'story', 'presence', 'not', 'just', 'largely', 'absent', 'largely', 'missed', 'opinion', 'viewer.Do', ""n't"", 'fret', 'Playtime', 'fans', 'do', 'have', 'positive', 'things', 'say', 'it.The', 'film', 'very', 'well-made', 'very', 'elaborate', 'sheer', 'architecture', 'set', 'design', 'exquisite', 'Beyond', 'Tati', 'uses', 'reflection', 'reinforce', 'themes', 'are', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'thing', 'rarely', 'pay', 'attention', 'too', 'that', 'stood', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'sound', 'use', 'sound', 'sound', 'editing', 'film', 'complex', 'brilliantly', 'structured', ""n't"", 'quiet', 'scene', 'entire', 'film', 'always', 'eternal', 'buzzing', 'humming', 'ticking', 'whirring', 'wheezing', 'modern', 'technology', 'sounds', 'are', 'used', 'remarkable', 'effect.The', 'sight', 'gags', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'articulate', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'amusing', 'scene', 'several', 'scenes', 'follow', 'Hulot', 'restaurant', 'glass', 'door', 'doorman', 'handle', 'continue', 'opening', 'door', 'people', 'brilliant', 'Tati', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'comfortable', 'possibly', 'even', 'much', 'more', 'home', 'silent', 'medium.Playtime', 'many', 'characteristics', 'could', 'sway', 'one', 'call', 'brilliant', 'true', 'much', 'film', 'bare', 'pure', 'brilliance', 'However', 'editing', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'done', 'film', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'quality', 'film', 'based', 'entertainment', 'value', 'especially', 'film', 'so', 'terrific', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'areas', 'However', 'lack', 'being', 'entertained', 'made', 'film', 'seem', 'inferior', 'other', 'Hulot-stories', 'many', 'ways', 'is.Large', 'portions', 'Playtime', 'move', 'snail', 'pace', 'found', 'zoning', 'out', 'entire', 'passages', 'movie.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Playtime', 'C-film', 'just', 'not', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'watching', 'again.GRADE', 'C']",N/A
999452,A1FG91CM8221X1,B000G8NXZ0,Miles D. Moore,"[3, 4]","""Playtime,"" by all accounts, was exactly the film Jacques Tati set out to make--and it destroyed him. As this Criterion Collection release tells us, ""Playtime"" was such a flop that Tati lost his production company, his fortune, his sister's fortune, his house and the rights to all his films (though he was later able to buy back the last). This is a textbook example of a filmmaker who, having absolute freedom to pursue his vision, did so with unbending rigor, resulting in a masterpiece that few viewers can relate to.Throughout his career--even in his first feature, ""Jour de Fete,"" where he didn't play M. Hulot--Tati was disinclined to make himself the central character, or even to have strong central characters. In ""Playtime,"" he takes this to its logical extreme: the real stars could be said to be the busload of American tourists ferried from place to place in an intimidatingly modernist Paris, in which the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe are glimpsed only in reflections from skyscraper windows. Hulot is there, and has some wonderful set pieces--such as the scene in which he investigates the rude noises made by the seat cushions in an ultra-modern waiting room. But Tati deliberately undercuts the presence of Hulot by including several other ""Hulots,"" including an English and an African one. (Richard Boston, who played the English Hulot, was a close friend of Terry Jones, who introduces ""Playtime"" on this DVD.)Tati was a director who loved the inexplicable things that occur on the sidelines of life--in the margins and between the lines. Throughout ""Playtime,"" and especially in the long restaurant sequence toward the film's end, there are several gags going on at once, in almost every frame of film. But because the gags aren't front and center, it seems there is nothing going on at all if you don't know where to look. It was once said of Faulkner's novels that they could never be read, only reread. By the same token, ""Playtime"" is a movie that can't be seen, only reseen. It is so aggressively modernist that it makes Godard look tame. Yet, even at a first viewing, you pick up on Tati's vision of life as a never-ending carnival, and on the cool, ineffable beauty of the Paris of Tati's imagination.",5,A filmmaker who loved the marginalia of life.,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,2233,"['Playtime', 'accounts', 'was', 'exactly', 'film', 'Jacques', 'Tati', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'destroyed', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'release', 'Playtime', 'was', 'flop', 'lost', 'production', 'company', 'fortune', 'sister', 'fortune', 'house', 'rights', 'films', 'was', 'later', 'able', 'buy', 'back', 'last', 'textbook', 'example', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'having', 'absolute', 'freedom', 'pursue', 'vision', 'did', 'so', 'unbending', 'rigor', 'resulting', 'masterpiece', 'few', 'viewers', 'can', 'relate', 'career', 'even', 'first', 'feature', 'Jour', 'de', 'Fete', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'M.', 'Hulot', 'Tati', 'was', 'disinclined', 'make', 'central', 'character', 'even', 'have', 'strong', 'central', 'characters', 'Playtime', 'logical', 'extreme', 'real', 'stars', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'busload', 'American', 'tourists', 'ferried', 'place', 'place', 'intimidatingly', 'modernist', 'Paris', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'Arc', 'Triomphe', 'are', 'glimpsed', 'only', 'reflections', 'skyscraper', 'windows', 'Hulot', 'there', 'wonderful', 'set', 'pieces', 'such', 'scene', 'rude', 'noises', 'made', 'seat', 'cushions', 'ultra-modern', 'waiting', 'room', 'Tati', 'deliberately', 'presence', 'Hulot', 'including', 'several', 'other', 'Hulots', 'including', 'English', 'African', 'one', 'Richard', 'Boston', 'who', 'played', 'English', 'Hulot', 'was', 'close', 'friend', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'who', 'Playtime', 'DVD', 'Tati', 'was', 'director', 'who', 'loved', 'inexplicable', 'things', 'occur', 'sidelines', 'life', 'margins', 'lines', 'Playtime', 'especially', 'long', 'restaurant', 'sequence', 'film', 'end', 'are', 'several', 'gags', 'going', 'once', 'almost', 'frame', 'film', 'gags', 'are', ""n't"", 'front', 'center', 'nothing', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'look', 'was', 'once', 'said', 'Faulkner', 'novels', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'read', 'only', 'reread', 'same', 'token', 'Playtime', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'seen', 'only', 'reseen', 'so', 'aggressively', 'modernist', 'Godard', 'look', 'tame', 'even', 'first', 'viewing', 'pick', 'up', 'Tati', 'vision', 'life', 'never-ending', 'carnival', 'cool', 'ineffable', 'beauty', 'Paris', 'Tati', 'imagination']",N/A
999453,A3E4P0QU692GN6,B000G8NXZ0,"Parker Benchley ""Edward Garea""","[0, 0]","Playtime was the film that broke director Jacques Tati. He mortgaged everything to make what he believed to be his masterpiece, and lost it all when the film tanked at the box office. Frankly, I believe it to be a flawed masterpiece, done in by not what it shows, but by what it doesn't show.As there is no real story to the film, the plot is simple: Mr. Hulot (Jacques Tati) has an appointment with an American official in Paris. At the same time tourists are arriving at an airport terminal that easily could pass for a office building and are taken in busses for a whirlwind tour of the city. As the tourists gawk at the wonders of modern Paris, Mr. Hulot finds himself lost in the maze of the new, modern Paris. The old, romantic Paris is only glimpsed as reflections in car windows and glass doors. Meanwhile, Hulot attempts to navigate the city as if he were not a denizen, but rather an explorer; finding himself lost in the maze of office cubicles and enclosed glass waiting rooms, dwarfed by the huge size and scale of the impersonal surroundings while trying to cope with all the accompanying indifferent efficiency with his usual individualism. The last half of the movie takes place at night at the grand opening of a night club, an almost Chaplinesque scene that opens with the arrival of workmen and waiters sweating the fine details as the first night's crowd arrives. This paean to modernity begins to self-destruct as every design flaw becomes glaringly apparent through the evening, resulting in spontaneous sort of revolution of fun and laughter amidst the chaos of the shallow dignified faade.Playtime follows Tati's earlier films with the absence of close-ups in favor of long and medium shots. It also continues Tati's theme of the cold and modern versus the warm and friendly older city, done so well in Mon Oncle. And like the earlier films, while Hulot is our most recognizable character, equal emphasis is placed on the supporting cast. In fact, Hulot disappears into the crowd during the second half of the film, and the film itself contains a running gag involving men who look like Hulot, but aren't.And that is the problem that ultimately sinks the film. Without Hulot at the center there is no clear connection between the personal and the impersonal. He is our guide, so to speak; our bulwark against the cold impersonal forces that seek to diminish the warmth found in humanity. In Mr. Hulot's Holiday, vacationers are so intent on having fun that they fail to do so. (A beautiful running gag in that film is the man whose vacation is always interrupted by calls from his broker.) It is only when Hulot accidentally sets off the shack of fireworks that people come to their senses and realize that the purpose of their visit is to put aside modern life and its accompanying hustle and bustle and just relax. In Mon Oncle, the difference between Hulot and his sister and brother-in-law couldn't be made clearer. The relatives live in a cold, impersonal, modern building with all its accoutrements while Hulot occupies a small apartment at the top of an old building in a section of Paris we think of when we imagine the 20s and 30s. (The running gag concerning the apartment is the length of stairs Hulot must ascend to reach his abode.) While sight gags were the dominant element in the earlier films, Playtime features sound effects, such as the many different sounds of people walking in the city. A little more dialogue instead might have worked wonders. When we do get a sight gag, Tati doesn't disappoint, as with the scene in the cafeteria where the intrusion of the light from a green pharmacy sign has a pronounced unpleasant effect on the customers and their food. But there simply aren't enough of these gags; between them are minutes and minutes of dreary colorless film where nothing happens. We wait for Mr. Hulot to take center stage and get the film moving, but instead of Hulot we seem to be waiting for Godot.But in both films Hulot is there; his presence meant to link us with the human as against the impersonal. His diminished role and subsequent disappearance during the second half of Playtime robs us in turn of the one person who can mediate our viewing experience and help us reach the point, as in his earlier films, of emotionally interacting with the film instead of merely being a spectator.

999454,ACLNARTC3NVJC,B000G8NXZ0,"PatrickO ""Patrick""","[4, 5]","What most people will care about is that this blu-ray looks and sounds spectacular. Outside of the road show release done a couple of years ago, when ""Playtime"" was showing in its original 70mm format in cities like New York and San Francisco, this is the best this movie is ever going to look.Criterion used the same HD master used for the 2007 re-release of the standard edition DVD, which is not a bad thing.  As a side note, there're some really interesting articles on the Web about the work that went into the restoration of Playtime.  The intro to the film is by Monty Python alumni Terry Jones. He talks about catching the film in initial release in Paris with his wife and being blown away that it was done in 70mm.  A lot of people truly were influenced by this film and love it.  It's a testament that Tati's work hasn't aged, though the clothing and hair styles of some of the actors say otherwise.A big plus of the blu-ray is that the uncompressed sound is fuller and adds to the experience. This is important because ""Playtime"" is a film with so little dialogue. It's a meditation on modern technology, how man adapts to it and trying to keep pace with change - all things that Tati surely experienced in his own life as a director/star making more traditional films during the height of the French New Wave led by Truffaut, Godard, Renais, and others.I didn't much care for the film myself on initial viewing eight or nine years ago. I thought, ""It figures. The French revere Jerry Lewis films also.""  I've watched it once or twice a year since then, partly to discover new visual gags that Tati used to stuff the frame of this film.  There's so much happening in the foreground, background and with sound that It operates on several layers, sometimes literally within the same frame.  Turn away for a moment and you're sure to miss something.Audiences of the time apparently preferred a film more focused on the antics of Msr. Hulot, like ""Mon Oncle"" and ""M. Hulot's Holiday"" (both available from Criterion.)  The film famously bankrupted director/star Jacques Tati.  But it's a masterwork of invention and ideas.  If you watch this movie, you owe it to yourself to run through it a couple of times to see what you catch that you missed the first go-round.  He really lived the mantra that good filmmaking was about showing something, not explaining it.Criterion probably couldn't afford the extra cost of trying to master this release from the 65mm restored original negative held by the Tati estate to create the latest DVD incarnation.  I had some hope that when popping in this movie it was have the staggeringly great image quality of the UK-released blu-ray of ""Zulu,"" a 1960s Michael Caine epic.  That one looks like it was made yesterday.  It's probably not feasible for any studio to do and not a realistic hope.Criterion knocked this one out of the park.  Hopefully they'll do the same with the upcoming blu-ray of ""Ran"" and (maybe one day) Fellini's ""Nights of Cabiria.""",4,"Finally in HD.

It harkens back to the silent comedy tradition of Keaton, Chaplin, and Lloyd; although it's essentially like nothing else in the history of cinema. Hulot is a very old-fashioned character, and he's caught in an imaginary futuristic version of Paris which is all glass and steel and cubicles. A lot of the humor derives from the droll contrast between Hulot and his surroundings. I like Playtime a lot more than M. Hulot's Holiday, which is essentially just a series of sight gags. Playtime builds to a wonderful climax in the nightclub party (there IS a plot, including a love story!), and it draws on the tension between Hulot and his environment. Playtime is a very visual film, with dozens of incredible sight gags, but notice the use of sound also; there are dozens of ""sound gags,"" marvelous sound effects (and great music!) that I can't really describe here.

999456,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B000G8NXZ0,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[1, 2]","Jacques Tati's 1967 film ""Playtime"" is often a paradox. Reportedly, it was three years in the making, and nearly a decade in planning. And it bankrupted its creator, who was insistent on re-shooting scenes and building enormous sets.Did the gambit pay off? Well, yes and no. No, because it failed to meet box office expectations to cover the money put into it (the most expensive French production at that time). And yes, because it was later hailed as Tati's crowning achievement (who lived long enough to see it happen).To the casual viewer, it is not an easy film to sit through, running at just over 2 hours long (while most comedies run at an economical 90 minutes). Tati's pace is often leisure, purposely matching the pace of his beloved character, Monsieur (or Mr.) Hulot, a polite but clumsy wanderer, often out of place in his surroundings. In fact, Tati uses Hulot sparingly in this film; the real stars, it seems, are other people and the ultra-modern buildings they file through.On the other hand, if you are patient enough with Tati's film style, there are some brilliant filmmaking moments here. The look of the film is unlike anything I've ever seen: a city filled with shiny, metallic monsters (with lots of glass) and chic nightclubs. Tati's genius lies in the fact he can focus on things that other comic talents miss: the idiosyncracies of people as they go about their business. Tati unifies his main theme with the terrible realization that we have created these structures to box ourselves in, to isolate ourselves from each other.There are beautiful visual gags to cherish here: Hulot accidentally shattering the glass door entrance to the nightclub..with the doorman carrying on the illusion of a glass door by moving the handle to & fro; Hulot spending the entire day looking for his future employer in a maze of a building (and never connecting); nightclub staff coping with faltering lighting, lose floor tiles and rowdy patrons (who reduce the place to shambles by daybreak); and a climactic merry-go-round of vehicles clustered in a street circle.Whether you find Tati's ""Playtime"" tedious or terrific, there's no question about the man himself: he's absolutely brilliant.The REAL big question is: When will Criterion package and release Tati's other films like ""Traffic"" and ""Jour de Fete"" for the American viewers to enjoy?",5,Tati's confounding masterpiece,1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,2355,"['Jacques', 'Tati', '1967', 'film', 'Playtime', 'often', 'paradox', 'Reportedly', 'was', 'three', 'years', 'making', 'nearly', 'decade', 'planning', 'bankrupted', 'creator', 'who', 'was', 'insistent', 're-shooting', 'scenes', 'building', 'enormous', 'sets.Did', 'gambit', 'pay', 'off', 'Well', 'yes', 'No', 'failed', 'meet', 'box', 'office', 'expectations', 'cover', 'money', 'put', 'most', 'expensive', 'French', 'production', 'time', 'yes', 'was', 'later', 'hailed', 'Tati', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'who', 'lived', 'long', 'enough', 'see', 'happen', '.To', 'casual', 'viewer', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'sit', 'running', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'most', 'comedies', 'run', 'economical', '90', 'minutes', 'Tati', 'pace', 'often', 'leisure', 'purposely', 'matching', 'pace', 'beloved', 'character', 'Monsieur', 'Mr.', 'Hulot', 'polite', 'clumsy', 'wanderer', 'often', 'place', 'surroundings', 'fact', 'Tati', 'Hulot', 'sparingly', 'film', 'real', 'stars', 'are', 'other', 'people', 'ultra-modern', 'buildings', 'file', 'through.On', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'patient', 'enough', 'Tati', 'film', 'style', 'are', 'brilliant', 'filmmaking', 'moments', 'here', 'look', 'film', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'city', 'filled', 'shiny', 'metallic', 'monsters', 'lots', 'glass', 'chic', 'nightclubs', 'Tati', 'genius', 'fact', 'can', 'focus', 'things', 'other', 'comic', 'talents', 'miss', 'idiosyncracies', 'people', 'go', 'business', 'Tati', 'main', 'theme', 'terrible', 'realization', 'have', 'created', 'structures', 'box', 'isolate', 'are', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'gags', 'cherish', 'here', 'Hulot', 'accidentally', 'shattering', 'glass', 'door', 'entrance', 'nightclub..with', 'doorman', 'carrying', 'illusion', 'glass', 'door', 'moving', 'handle', 'fro', 'Hulot', 'spending', 'entire', 'day', 'looking', 'future', 'employer', 'maze', 'building', 'never', 'connecting', 'nightclub', 'staff', 'coping', 'faltering', 'lighting', 'lose', 'floor', 'tiles', 'rowdy', 'patrons', 'who', 'reduce', 'place', 'shambles', 'daybreak', 'climactic', 'merry-go-round', 'vehicles', 'clustered', 'street', 'circle.Whether', 'find', 'Tati', 'Playtime', 'tedious', 'terrific', 'question', 'man', 'absolutely', 'brilliant.The', 'REAL', 'big', 'question', 'When', 'will', 'Criterion', 'package', 'release', 'Tati', 'other', 'films', 'Traffic', 'Jour', 'de', 'Fete', 'American', 'viewers', 'enjoy']",N/A

I would describe ""Play Time"" as funny and there WERE at least a couple of times that I laughed out loud.  However, the humor is more subtle in PT and more slapstick in MHH and it is the quality of that subtle humor that led me to rate it as high as I did; that and the marvelous sets.Imagine a day in which everything that could go wrong did go wrong.  Well that seems to be what happens to everyone (with the possible exception of Mr. Hulot) in ""Play Time"".

999458,A361LE16VBQDP8,B000G8NXZ0,Robert Bezimienny,"[2, 2]","For those familiar with the film, the Blu-ray edition is a spectacular improvement over the SD DVD.  Seen on a 120 inch screen via a 1080p projector, suddenly the film works as intended.  While it goes without saying that a James Bond film is more exciting at high volume on the big screen, it still works as entertainment at home on a modest TV.  Playtime, however, only really functions when it's cinematic.  Criterion's wonderful decision to release this on Blu-ray makes this a possibility.  The film needs size, and size demands HD detail, especially when a joke might be occupying a tiny fraction of the total screen.  Some of Criterion's Blu-ray reissues, while terrific films, don't benefit greatly from HD (The Third Man, and even Wages of Fear, come to mind) - but Playtime becomes a different experience.  The image quality is excellent - on a par with any colour HD restoration of a film of the period that I've seen (e.g. The Wild Bunch, A Clockwork Orange) - of course, the film elements are 40 years old and Mr.Hulot is not as athletic as Daniel Craig, his love interest tends to wear an overcoat, and (spoiler alert!) there are no explosions.  There are no car chases, but there is a traffic jam.  So, yes, visually you'll be immersed, but your socks won't be blown into the next room.Tati's creation does not function as a traditional narrative.  Often enough different sectors of the framed image compete for the viewer's attention - there is a unique freedom available to the viewer: you can literally choose what you would like to focus upon.  In this the film truly approaches the experience of a being an observer in ordinary life.  And, a bit like ordinary life, you have do some of the work if you're hoping to find what you're viewing interesting.  Perhaps at times you might find yourself bored - but there's room enough in the film to sustain some boredom.  You can drift off into your own thoughts and return to the film as you will.Of course the film is filled with surprising observations from Tati himself, and inimicable visual and auditory humour.  There's little in the way of dialogue, but the voice of an electronic button, or the background hum in a room, or the noise of the street as the camera voyeuristically peers through a window, makes Playtime  anything but a silent movie.  Again, Tati offers us the opportunity to not only see the ordinary afresh, but to also hear it anew.Like a great painting, or a great novel, or a great play, Playtime invites you to see the world from a new and different vantage.  For all its intellectual and aesthetic verve, Playtime does operate in a limited emotional range.  Like its predominantly grey colour palette, the film's emotions are muffled - Mr.Hulot is a little baffled, a little bewildered, yet he remains intrigued and charmed by the world - his distance from the world allows in his comedy - but it's not a comedy that channels any of the grand passions.  Frustration, alienation, emptiness, a critique of modernity's soullessness, all this can be contemplated during the film, accompanied by a smile.

This is a sweet, quiet, mild-mannered, virtually plotless film played out against brilliant sets.  Jacques Tati's ""M. Hulot"" character is an acquired taste, and I'm not entirely sure I've acquired it.  It is so gentle as to be virtually non-imposing.  The humor is mild.  The film has a democratic image - you can focus on whatever you'd like it almost any scene - but that also makes the director passive, in a sense.All this said, I bought the Criterion DVD and bought the Criterion Blu-ray.

Play Time is a combination of physical humor, farce and clever observational humor. There's very little dialogue, so don't be put off by the French, English and German language included in the description. This is all about watching a series of events and seeing the absurdity of it all.Jacques Tati dedicated nine years of his life to the film and it was in production for three years. The sets were giant and the cast enormous. If you are familiar with Tati, you'll know that his Monsieur Hulot character appeared in four of his films and one short story. Play Time is the most celebrated, but the venture resulted in Tati declaring bankruptcy.There isn't a plot as such, but the story opens in an airport. I think Tati was trying to show how vast and impersonal airports are. He also shows a lot of technology and demonstrates how ludicrous it is. In an early scene, he has a meeting in an office building. It's made of glass and contains dozens of identical cubicles. His arrival is logged on a computer, but the result is anything but efficient. In a comedy of errors, he keeps failing to make his presence known to the right person.Hulot is a helpful person at heart, but everything he touches results in chaos. He improves some things and ruins others. Unlike just about every film in existence, Play Time doesn't focus on its characters. Instead of showing personal interactions, we see rooms, stores and streets filled with people. There are multiple interactions at all times. If you watch Play Time several times, you'll see something new every time.Almost half of the film is devoted to a scene in a nightclub. It's expecting to serve 50 people, but well over a hundred turn up. The staff members desperately try to find food to serve. It's a new building and things aren't completely ready, so it's coming apart at the seams by the end of the night. Chairs break, walls collapse and wiring overheats. The guests are having too much of a good time to notice. Throughout all these events, Monsieur Hulot keeps showing up.The final scene is set in the street and involves huge numbers of people and cars. It requires everything to be perfectly choreographed for it to work. The result looks like a living fairground with cars and the movement of people looking like a giant merry-go-round. It doesn't sound that impressive when you read the words on a screen, but you'll see how much effort went into Play Time when you watch the film.Comedy of this nature is virtually dead.Criterion's Blu-ray presentation contains the original French language track and the international language track. Aside from some dirt during the titles, the picture quality is superb.",4,Comedy on a grand scale,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,2848,"['Play', 'Time', '1967', 'Comedy', '124', 'minutes', 'French', 'English', 'German', 'LanguageDirected', 'Jacques', 'TatiStarring', 'Jacques', 'Tati', 'Barbara', 'DennekThere', 'are', 'many', 'different', 'types', 'comedy', 'Play', 'Time', 'combination', 'physical', 'humor', 'farce', 'clever', 'observational', 'humor', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'French', 'English', 'German', 'language', 'included', 'description', 'watching', 'series', 'events', 'seeing', 'absurdity', 'Tati', 'dedicated', 'nine', 'years', 'life', 'film', 'was', 'production', 'three', 'years', 'sets', 'were', 'giant', 'cast', 'enormous', 'are', 'familiar', 'Tati', ""'ll"", 'know', 'Monsieur', 'Hulot', 'character', 'appeared', 'four', 'films', 'one', 'short', 'story', 'Play', 'Time', 'most', 'celebrated', 'venture', 'resulted', 'Tati', 'declaring', 'bankruptcy.There', ""n't"", 'plot', 'such', 'story', 'airport', 'think', 'Tati', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'how', 'vast', 'impersonal', 'airports', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'technology', 'how', 'ludicrous', 'early', 'scene', 'meeting', 'office', 'building', 'made', 'glass', 'dozens', 'identical', 'cubicles', 'arrival', 'logged', 'computer', 'result', 'anything', 'efficient', 'comedy', 'errors', 'failing', 'make', 'presence', 'known', 'right', 'person.Hulot', 'helpful', 'person', 'heart', 'everything', 'results', 'chaos', 'things', 'others', 'Unlike', 'just', 'film', 'existence', 'Play', 'Time', ""n't"", 'focus', 'characters', 'Instead', 'showing', 'personal', 'interactions', 'see', 'rooms', 'stores', 'streets', 'filled', 'people', 'are', 'multiple', 'interactions', 'times', 'watch', 'Play', 'Time', 'several', 'times', ""'ll"", 'see', 'something', 'new', 'time.Almost', 'half', 'film', 'devoted', 'scene', 'nightclub', 'expecting', 'serve', '50', 'people', 'well', 'hundred', 'turn', 'up', 'staff', 'members', 'desperately', 'try', 'find', 'food', 'serve', 'new', 'building', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'completely', 'ready', 'coming', 'apart', 'seams', 'end', 'night', 'Chairs', 'break', 'walls', 'collapse', 'wiring', 'overheats', 'guests', 'are', 'having', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'time', 'notice', 'events', 'Monsieur', 'Hulot', 'showing', 'up.The', 'final', 'scene', 'set', 'street', 'huge', 'numbers', 'people', 'cars', 'everything', 'be', 'perfectly', 'choreographed', 'work', 'result', 'living', 'fairground', 'cars', 'movement', 'people', 'looking', 'giant', 'merry-go-round', ""n't"", 'sound', 'impressive', 'when', 'read', 'words', 'screen', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'much', 'effort', 'went', 'Play', 'Time', 'when', 'watch', 'film.Comedy', 'nature', 'virtually', 'dead.Criterion', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'original', 'French', 'language', 'track', 'international', 'language', 'track', 'Aside', 'dirt', 'titles', 'picture', 'quality', 'superb']",N/A
