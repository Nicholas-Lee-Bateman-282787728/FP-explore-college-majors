Try making an effects based movie with zero dollars. The acting? The Asylum only ever has one ""real"" actor in any of their flicks and all that budget apparently went to Richard Grieco's hammy villain Loki. The plot or story? Has an Asylum movie ever really had a script to speak of? Having seen several of their other films, I sometimes think that the crew arrives on day one and starts filming immediately, working out what is going to happen on an improvisational whim. All are hallmarks of classic Asylum films.So on to this specific movie. The effects on Thor are obviously inferior say to the big-budget Thor movie that was ""co-incidentally"" released the same week-end. But what direct to dvd/ made for Syfy channel movie would pass that litmus test? While certainly not awe-inspiring, the CG in Thor is not jaw-droppingly awful either. A definite step-up when compared to prior Asylum features in my opinion. The actors are serviceable for the profile of the movie. Wrestler Kevin Nash as the wise All-Father Odin? Stunt casting to be sure, but fun. The main protagonists are a bit wooden and stilted (particularly Cody Deal's Thor who was obviously cast more for his look and was saddled with a very uneven character.) Sometimes bad acting is a by-product of poor scripting and a low-budget movie is usually saddled by a confluence of both as is Almighty Thor.Thor at least seems to proceed along a linear path to its final confrontation between Thor and Loki. One bad plot point as others have mentioned is Thor's bull-headedness, which is in character for the headstrong Thunder-God. Thor is portrayed as very weak during most of the film which is not so in-character. When rating movies such as Almighty Thor, I try to compare it to its Mock-Buster brethren rather than the ""blockbusters"" from which they take their inspiration.

The acting was horrendous. On the other hand, the special effects were not the worst I've seen. Though there were no strings holding up the icky bugs, it looked like anyone with a PC could have strung together the portals and icky bugs with photo shop and some off-the-shelf animation software.The kid? I don't know where they got him from but he seriously needs some acting lessons. He's definitely got the body to be Thor, but his acting needs serious work. Maybe I should just blame the wretched script. For a God, he acted more like he was 7 in the body of a 30 year old. That whole never listening to the hot babe thing was just so overdone, it ruined what might have been a decent movie done over with some cheesy special effects.Now for the hot chick, Patricia Velasquez. She's a babe, no doubt. Great accent, nice moves, but she was really struggling to work with such a lousy script. I have never seen her before, at least I don't think so, but she is beautiful and I hope this movie doesn't ruin her career. The voice of wisdom, trying to talk some sense into a god that would NEVER... let me repeat this, NEVER listen to her under any circumstances. In fact, the whole plot seemed to center around the fact that Thor would NEVER listen to her.Now let's talk about Richard Greico. He played the nasty villain to the hilt. Walked around a lot in first the ancient god place and then modern earth (what???) being vile and nasty. I guess the producers got their money's worth out of him. He really had a chance to ham it up. I don't blame him, I blame the writer's, or maybe the director or even the producers for handing him such a lousy script to work with. He may have sensed that he was starring in a big stinker, but maybe he thought it would turn out better than it did. You just never know until you see it played back. He may be hiding out right about now, or he may be busy making another movie somewhere, totally unaware of all the negative hoopla in his wake. I still like Richard. He's cool, it's just that you can't win them all.As for the plot? Thor wants to avenge his father's death at the hands of Loki. Loki wants the magical hammer and to kill tree of life. Girl tries to help, but Thor won't listen. Rest of movie centers on Thor getting in trouble because he WON'T listen to Girl who knows how to help him get hammer.Wait for the bigger budget Thor movie to come out in theaters.

1420091,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B004MOLFR2,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[0, 1]","This was never meant to be high art, or a blockbuster.  To judge it against such standards would be to apply the same kind of aesthetic judgment one uses with regard to Da Vinci or Monet to assess my elementary grade sponge-and-watercolour paintings.  For what they are, my paintings were okay -- they even won the occasional award.  But here I sit, no master artist.In looking into this film, I was introduced for the first time to a word - mockbuster.  I knew that Hollywood frequently had similar projects going on; the films 'Armageddon' and 'Deep Impact' could not have been planned and produced without knowledge of each other, for example.  But a mockbuster is a different animal - it is a film designed deliberately to ride the coat-tails of a larger production; in this case, Marvel's 'Thor', the big-budget blockbuster, was planned for a Spring 2011 release.  Enter Asylum, a production company that specialises in such enterprises.'Almighty Thor' premiered on SyFy about the same time as Marvel's 'Thor' appeared in the cinema.  There's really no mistaking the two.  Both start with the premise of the Norse legends, and draw from the character sets, but both go from there in different directions.  'Almighty Thor' went down the road less expensive.  Perhaps the biggest name in the production was Richard Grieco, as the demonic deity Loki, who has every intention of wreaking havoc with as little expense as possible.  Other names of note include Kevin Nash as Odin, Jess Allen as his non-titular son Baldir, and Patricia Velasquez as Jarnsaxa, because every Nordic female character will have a Hispanic accent.  Perhaps that comes from living in Los Angeles in the modern times.  Yes, you heard that right - Thor battles Loki, with the help of Jarnsaxa, in the back alleys and by-ways (wherever location charges were cheap or non-existent) of the greater LA region.The plot isn't great - Odin and Baldir get killed (yes, you read that right - the immortals get killed) and Thor, who isn't yet prepared for fighting, has to avenge their deaths.  He challenges Loki in different ways, who usually has the upper hand until the end (spoiler alert! sorry if that spoils it for you).  But who is Thor?  Well, he certainly looks the part -- Cody Deal, a midwestern bodybuilder/model type turned Las Vegas/southern California dreamer, dreaming of an acting career.  You know he's buff, as he was real-life Caesar's Palace centurion, and there's no room for soft-focus or long-range lensing in real life.  But I am reminded here of the late Richard Burton, who described his body of work as consisting of a few good things, but primarily films which blessedly had faded from memory.  I suspect this might be one of the later for Deal, if he goes on to make better films; if not, well...  Deal talked of needing money for acting lessons; it is a good sign at least that he recognises the need for them.  Rumor has it there were those willing to front the needed money for them, but things do fall apart and fail to follow through.Principal photography for a film will often take months; this was done in less than two weeks.  Editing often also takes months; this was again done in a matter of a few weeks.  The CGI was rather amateurish - this can often be among the more expensive and time-consuming aspects of film, and time and money were not available.  Some of the screen shots and transitions reminded me of 'Plan 9' in that they didn't always seem to fit together.  Remarkably, Alan Smithee did not direct this, but I'm not entirely sure if anyone did -- nonetheless, Christopher Ray gets the credit here, whose other directing credits include fare such as 'Mega Shark vs Crocosaurus' and 'Reptisaurus'.  But then, checking the IMDb listing, it appears Ray was born to this kind of production, having played Christopher the baby in 'The Brain Leeches' before he was one year old.I can't say I liked the film, but I didn't despise it, either.  When I saw it on SyFy, it was paired with another Thor-related film (starring Zachery Ty Bryan of 'Home Improvement' fame) called 'Hammer of the Gods', another less-than-epic rendering of a tangentially-related story.  It will not surprise me when the awards shows overlook this production.  It wouldn't surprise me to see this repeated occasionally on SyFy, and among the fans and friends of those involved in the production, a reasonable DVD business.So, I can't really recommend this film, even though there was a time prior to seeing it that I wanted to (truth in advertising here, I was in contact, however limited, with someone on the production and had hoped for success for his sake, but then, as I stated above, things do fall apart and fail to follow through).  But I won't pound it into potshards with an almighty hammer, either.  It is what it is.

1420092,A1SHNOU2ODKIDG,B004MOLFR2,Gregorio,"[0, 2]","The Asylum has been producing low budget films for years and while their technical quality has now reached YouTube level, the films are getting worse.  ALMIGHTY THOR is no MEGASHARK or even INTERMEDIO or JOLLY ROGER.  What is especially infuriating about this one is that the film could have been better with just a few obvious fixes.  Yes, the script is incomprehensible and entirely awful and has a dazed Richard Grieco muttering lines like: ""you don't understand the power of the bone.""  Even so, there are mistakes in this awful film that are entirely without excuse.  The Asylum has gotten to the point where they are occasionally able to produce visual effects of a barely acceptable quality (a huge leap forward for them), yet they continue to insert effects shots that look to be less than half finished.  Standard photography is also frequently out of focus.  Okay . . . it's a low budget film so I can live with that.  There is NO excuse for the ""costumes"" in this film which are worse than anything you might stumble across at an after Halloween clearance sale at WalMart.  What is Richard Greico (as Loki) supposed to be wearing?  Is he perhaps a bondage enthusiast?  What about poor Kevin Nash (as Odin) stumbling about in a plastic Roman Centurian breastplate and bear skin rug?  What are we to make of Patricia Velasquez (as Joxanna) who is at one point sporting what appears to be genuine shag carpeting?  And how about the sad case of Cody Deal (as Thor) who actually has a body that could do justice to his character.  We get a couple of glimpses of his very Thorlike physique and the rest of the time he is covered in plastic armour, blankets and a trech coat that looks like it came from a dumpster in the ally that the film's characters are eternally meandering about in.  If you have an actor with a body like Cody Deal playing a super hero like Thor then why on earth do you cover him in this odd assortment of GoodWill rejects?How about those hammers?  This film has two of them.  The Hammer of Destiny is constructed of a piece of PVC and some spray painted styrofoam.  The Thor Forged Hammer is a broom handle with a cardboard box covered in aluminium foil.  If Asylum can find the budget to make CGI dinosaurs (and why are all of these peculiar lizards being summoned from the ground in this THOR movie?) why can't they get a decent looking hammer?The acting is bad but that may simply be because the actors had no time to learn their lines or work on their roles.  Kevin Nash seems like he might have been an interesting Odin (if his voice had been dubbed) but he gets nothing coherent to say in this script (no one does) and no direction from Christopher Douglis-Olin Ray.  Richard Grieco seems embarrased (and if you are doing an Asylum film then yes, your career is over unless you can get on DANCING WITH THE STARS).  Patricia Valesquez is unintelligible with an accent so thick it is undecipherable and her haggard appearance makes her a very unlikely love interest for the God of Thunder.  Cody Deal has the right look to play Thor (but a curiously modern short hair cut destroys the illusion) but his inexperience shows everytime he opens his mouth. Still he isn't entirely awful and he has an innocent quality that could have brought a unique twist to Thor.  If he had a decent director or dialogue coach he might have fared better.  It's unfortunate.  This entire film is unfortunate.  Asylum has been around long enough that they should be doing far, far better than this.  They HAVE done far, far better than this one.  ALMIGHTY THOR never reaches the point of being so bad it's good.  There are even some shots in this film (check out the heart of the world tree segment) that are striking and visually well composed.  That isn't to the films credit though. It merely demonstrates that there are people working at The Asylum that have some genuine talent but are just too lazy and uninspired to give a damn. They really can't use inexperience, lack of time and budget as an excuse any longer. Their bad movies are no longer funny or entertaining.

While they also release monster, horror, comedy, and other genre movies, their mockbusters are the most obvious and controversial. The Asylum's challenge is making a movie called ""Almighty Thor"" that does not infringe upon the Marvel Thor.OVERALLThat said, this movie is a fair-to-middling movie.  The script is a bit thin in spots, and the characters' growth and development are not believable.  However, the movie is watchable, and my mind can create its own fixes for the poorly-written script.  Overall rating is a strong two stars.CHARACTERS/ACTORS* Odin (Kevin Nash) - Kevin Nash's real-life physique and fighting moves are downplayed, but he makes a believable warrior-Odin.  Unfortunately, Odin dies in the first 15 minutes.* Baldir (Jess Allen) - The actor's name is unfamiliar, but the acting is solid.  Baldir is a no-nonsense tough guy.  Without spoiling too much of the movie, Baldir also dies early.* Thor (Cody Deal) - Cody Deal has the innocent face of an 18-year-old and a well-toned physique.  Both aspects fit the young, untested, unskilled Thor of this movie.  Thor is a man-child who is stubborn beyond all reason.* J&aacute;rnsaxa (Patricia Velasquez) - Patricia Velasquez is a wiry, tough-looking warrior who protects Thor.* Loki (Richard Grieco) - Richard Grieco looks evil, undead, inhuman, menacing, and condescending.THE GOOD* Thor is stubborn enough to ignore good advice and make tremendous mistakes.  He does not learn from his mistakes but accepts the consequences.  And Thor almost literally shapes his own destiny.  This type of character is unusual; Thor had me wincing at his unwise decisions.* J&aacute;rnsaxa is Thor's equal and possibly his better in every way.* Loki is evil and a master of illusion.* The movie has some good swordfight scenes.  Guns are also used.  :)* The disaster scenes are good.THE BAD* The romance between Thor and J&aacute;rnsaxa is not believable.  Comrades-in-arms, perhaps.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[11, 12]","Oh, how one has to love Asylum Home Entertainment and their association with the SyFy Channel original programming department. They are on fire this year matching up cheapie productions with similarly titled big screen counterparts. ""Almighty Thor"" hit the little screen the same weekend ""Thor"" hammered into movie complexes across the country and for those of us hoping for bad movie nirvana--once again, they missed the mark on an actual fun quotient. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE bad movie mayhem--cheap effects and bad actors don't bother me as long as the cheese factor can tickle my funny bone. Sadly, with this disastrous effort, they simply lacked the interest to write and produce something with even the slightest amount of amusement or entertainment value.Well, that's not entirely accurate--I did giggle a couple of times. Thor is outfitted in a get-up straight from the Halloween Spirit Store and his legendary hammer is clearly a toy made of Styrofoam! This cheap production values allowed for about six recurring pedestrians to be wandering about the alleys of the big city. When destruction begins, they randomly run in every direction! This general havoc and silliness might have won me over had not the rest of the picture been so downbeat and inept. It seems a bit unnecessary to recount a plot--but here's a taste. Richard Greico plays the devilish villain as a walking embodiment of expressionless menace. After dispatching Thor's wooden family, he chases Thor and his warrior love interest into a modern day city in pursuit of the hammer. From then on out, he skulks through about one city block of anonymous industrial city landscape in slow motion pursuit. Oh, if only Thor had moved away from this part of the city--so much destruction could have been avoided!Cody Deal, as Thor plays the hero as a petulant child and his love interest (who has zero chemistry with Deal) delivers line readings as flat as a proverbial pancake. Favorite moment: She takes him to her dwelling on Earth. She explains she has to fit in with the humans, but guess where she lives? If you guessed a storage unit, you guessed right! She doesn't even have a change of clothes! Luckily, however, she has two black trench coats so the otherworldly beings will look right at home as the parade up and down the same alley. The inevitable confrontations are both repetitive and uninteresting. If someone had been the ham and someone had provided the cheese, these might have provided some silly fun--but everyone is so painfully flat, it's hard to muster much concern. Listen, Asylum and its fan can embrace the badness--they just have to realize not to forget that bad films need to entertain as well. Being bad for the sake of being bad really doesn't seem like a smart movie making strategy--at least do it with a wink and a nod to those who would embrace your pictures.

""Almighty Thor"" who is not really that mighty but more of a whiny wimp and is consistantly one-upped in warrior skills by his companion, a sort of Xena Warrior princess type. The locations include Valhalla-King Odin's matte kingdom and a warehouse in Los Angeles.  Xena passes in and out of a time portal and divides her time between ancient times and modern day LA. She hides Thor in her warehouse and immediately teaches him to shoot a semi-automatic.  He sucks at sword-weilding but picks up shot accuracy in 5 seconds flat.  Later on he switches between an AK assault weapon and his Hammer which looks like a big rock tied to a stick.  Slinking around the edges of the movie is Richard Greico as Loki the devil who wants the Hammer so he can destroy the world.  Mr Greicos make-up looked like he sat at a table and stuck his face in a bowl of flour.There are a total of 5 characters in this movie with a couple of brief cameos by a couple of extras.When Thor finally finds the Hammer in the tree of life he loses it 5 minutes later to the flour-faced devil.  Loki sends Thor to hell and Thor fashions a new Hammer from a convenient fireball in hell.  Thor finally masters the power of the Hammer two minutes before the movie's end-saves the world and a throng of three show up to cheer on the hero.Oh and by the way, the devil also has a few dinosaur K-9's to track and sniff out Thor in the modern world but the dinosaurs prefer to go all Godzilla on LA.I hope anyone who reads my review believe my plot descriptions are accurate.
