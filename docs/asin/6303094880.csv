Whilst the script is by theatre writer Michael Frayn, the script is so full of Cleeseisms it could have been written for him (or perhaps Cleese made some revisions).

The supporting cast is a delight, with Joan Hickson giving a wonderfully entertaining portrayal of a dotty old lady worried about who would inherit her late mother's sherry glasses. Much of the cast had featured with Cleese in Fawlty Towers, Geoffrey Palmer, Pat Keen, Ann Way, and if you look closely you can see future Eastenders Leslie Schofield and John Bardon in small roles, and Operation Good Guys' Mark Burdis as a schoolboy.

The pace is kept just taut enough throughout (something A Fish Called Wanda never managed) and the roll-call of British character actors is dished out liberally without ever turning into an &quot;ooh look, it's him off of Kinvig!&quot; distraction, most notably Geoffrey Palmer, Penelope Wilton and Stephen Moore.",4,Yes Cleese!,1067299200,"10 28, 2003",2003,515,"[""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'way', 'penetrating', 'insights', 'religion', 'frantic', 'Frayn/Cleese', 'race', 'East', 'Anglia', 'as', 'good', 'transposition', 'farce', 'silver', 'screen', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'pace', 'kept', 'just', 'taut', 'enough', 'something', 'Fish', 'Called', 'Wanda', 'never', 'managed', 'roll-call', 'British', 'character', 'actors', 'dished', 'out', 'liberally', 'ever', 'turning', 'quot', 'ooh', 'look', 'Kinvig', 'quot', 'distraction', 'most', 'notably', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'Stephen', 'Moore']",Clockwise VHS

Right, I mean insanity by inches.He starts as a utterly rigid headmaster, the kind so precise that he stops in mid-sentence to make sure that the clock ticks when it should. Right. He sets out, at the precise moment, to accept a major award for himself and his school. Right?Right.Then just a little thing happens. A very little thing. He asks the way to the train - which is it? Left?Right.And right he goes. From that point forward, it's a comedy of errors. At each new error, Cleese's character adds a notch to the pressure. Step by step, the frenzy increases, new characters add their bits to the pressure (""sherry glasses"", for example), until you expect everyone to burst a vein. Somewhere along the line, Cleese ends up in just his boxers, as required. The ending is very British, with all of the various police jurisdictions politely working out which characters go to which gaols.I swear, I've had days like that.There are a few nits to pick here. That high-school girl had more of a twenty-something look about her, for example. But c'mon, the story works, the characters work, the mishaps work, and it all comes together in the perfect ""thank gawd it's not me"" experience.If you set your expectations low enough, this is sure to exceed them. It's a specimen of the 'goofy britcom' species, and a stunning one at that.

355662,AMMEMPM9MPS55,6303094880,www.DavidLRattigan.com,"[16, 16]","This was clearly designed as a vehicle for John Cleese, cashing in on his international fame as Basil Fawlty. Here, as headmaster Brian Stimpson, he gets to engage in all the familiar Fawltyesque madness with great relish. However, it manages not to descend into meaninglessness and pedantry like so many comedy star vehicles tend to, since it boasts an excellent script by veteran playwright Christopher Frayn. It is all delicately paced, and nicely played out with typical British charm by a host of comedy regulars including Alison Steadman and Geoffrey Palmer.The movie basically follows a day in the life of the time-obsessed Stimpson as he makes his way to a conference in Norwich, where he is to make a speech as the first ever grammar-school head to be made president of the headmasters association. Beginning with missing his train, we follow Stimpson in his ill-fated attempts to get to Norwich on time. Plenty of opportunity for mayhem and chaos along the way, as well as some laughs stemming from Cleese's irredeemably pedantic character. Nothing deep, but lots of fun.",4,Vintage British Comedy,1012262400,"01 29, 2002",2002,1081,"['was', 'clearly', 'designed', 'vehicle', 'John', 'Cleese', 'cashing', 'international', 'fame', 'Basil', 'Fawlty', 'Here', 'headmaster', 'Brian', 'Stimpson', 'engage', 'familiar', 'Fawltyesque', 'madness', 'great', 'relish', 'However', 'not', 'descend', 'meaninglessness', 'pedantry', 'so', 'many', 'comedy', 'star', 'vehicles', 'tend', 'excellent', 'script', 'veteran', 'playwright', 'Christopher', 'Frayn', 'delicately', 'paced', 'nicely', 'played', 'out', 'typical', 'British', 'charm', 'host', 'comedy', 'regulars', 'including', 'Alison', 'Steadman', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer.The', 'movie', 'basically', 'day', 'life', 'time-obsessed', 'Stimpson', 'way', 'conference', 'Norwich', 'where', 'make', 'speech', 'first', 'ever', 'grammar-school', 'head', 'be', 'made', 'president', 'headmasters', 'association', 'Beginning', 'missing', 'train', 'follow', 'Stimpson', 'ill-fated', 'attempts', 'get', 'Norwich', 'time', 'Plenty', 'opportunity', 'mayhem', 'chaos', 'way', 'as', 'well', 'laughs', 'stemming', 'Cleese', 'irredeemably', 'pedantic', 'character', 'Nothing', 'deep', 'lots', 'fun']",Clockwise VHS
