688133,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005V9I6,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","It's amazing a movie that centers around a shooter killing cab drivers isn't the least bit exciting or interesting to watch, but that's exactly what 3 a.m. is all about- being flat out *boring*.  I detect a noticeable 80's tone throughout the movie too, which means had I not known any details before going into it (and of course, ignoring how much Danny Glover has aged) I'd have easily believed I was actually watching a film from the 80's.  Speaking of Danny Glover, shame on him for starring in such a lackluster, low budget film.You'd think there must be a great deal of exciting suspense around every corner with taxi drivers fearing for their lives that tonight might be their last night, and that you'd see police officers getting involved in the case of a murderer killing taxi drivers however NONE of this ever occurs.  Instead it's all about the taxi drivers having their own little dilemmas involving relationships and friendships (such as Sergej Trifunovic and Danny Glover), a waitress played by Pam Grier having her own job and relationship issues, and Michelle Rodriguez coming to terms with events that have haunted her past and basically being angry and defensive at every turn.Eventually Michelle begins to see people's faces change which is a laughable attempt at throwing in supernatural elements.  Talk about totally out of place there.  Soon after this, many of the key characters become involved in their own murderous plots with as little excitement and drama as possible so we really don't care at all.None of this nonsense really relates to the bigger, more serious problem- a gun shooter on the loose but nobody cares.  Many of the characters show no concern whatsoever about this and go about their daily routine normally.  You may say ""That's the rough and tough attitude of a taxi driver"" but to show *no* concern whatsoever is rather odd and creates an even bigger issue- no compelling storytelling for us, the viewers.  So it's just a failure of a film.Other than that, the film basically portrays these characters as typical city folks just making a living any way they can, which may be accurate but... for the sake of a movie, the crucial elements of suspense, excitement and interest are all missing which makes this a pretty boring movie overall.  It's almost like watching a soap opera really.  Do NOT be fooled by the misleading description- I can't stress this enough.  It's *incredibly* inaccurate.",1,don't call this cab,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,2440,"['amazing', 'movie', 'centers', 'shooter', 'killing', 'cab', 'drivers', ""n't"", 'least', 'bit', 'exciting', 'interesting', 'watch', 'exactly', 'what', '3', 'a.m.', 'about-', 'being', 'flat', 'out', '*boring*', 'detect', 'noticeable', '80', 'tone', 'movie', 'too', 'had', 'not', 'known', 'details', 'going', 'course', 'ignoring', 'how', 'much', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'aged', ""'d"", 'have', 'easily', 'believed', 'was', 'actually', 'watching', 'film', '80', 'Speaking', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'shame', 'starring', 'such', 'lackluster', 'low', 'budget', 'film.You', ""'d"", 'think', 'must', 'be', 'great', 'deal', 'exciting', 'suspense', 'corner', 'taxi', 'drivers', 'fearing', 'lives', 'tonight', 'might', 'be', 'last', 'night', ""'d"", 'see', 'police', 'officers', 'getting', 'involved', 'case', 'murderer', 'killing', 'taxi', 'drivers', 'however', 'NONE', 'ever', 'Instead', 'taxi', 'drivers', 'having', 'own', 'little', 'dilemmas', 'involving', 'relationships', 'friendships', 'such', 'Sergej', 'Trifunovic', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'waitress', 'played', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'having', 'own', 'job', 'relationship', 'issues', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'coming', 'terms', 'events', 'have', 'haunted', 'past', 'basically', 'being', 'angry', 'defensive', 'turn.Eventually', 'Michelle', 'see', 'people', 'change', 'laughable', 'attempt', 'throwing', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'Talk', 'totally', 'place', 'there', 'Soon', 'many', 'key', 'characters', 'become', 'involved', 'own', 'murderous', 'plots', 'as', 'little', 'excitement', 'drama', 'possible', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'all.None', 'nonsense', 'really', 'bigger', 'more', 'serious', 'problem-', 'gun', 'shooter', 'loose', 'nobody', 'cares', 'Many', 'characters', 'show', 'concern', 'whatsoever', 'go', 'daily', 'routine', 'normally', 'may', 'say', 'rough', 'tough', 'attitude', 'taxi', 'driver', 'show', '*no*', 'concern', 'whatsoever', 'rather', 'odd', 'even', 'bigger', 'issue-', 'compelling', 'storytelling', 'viewers', 'just', 'failure', 'film.Other', 'film', 'basically', 'characters', 'typical', 'city', 'folks', 'just', 'making', 'living', 'way', 'can', 'may', 'be', 'accurate', 'sake', 'movie', 'crucial', 'elements', 'suspense', 'excitement', 'interest', 'are', 'missing', 'pretty', 'boring', 'movie', 'overall', 'almost', 'watching', 'soap', 'opera', 'really', 'Do', 'NOT', 'be', 'fooled', 'misleading', 'description-', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'enough', '*incredibly*', 'inaccurate']",3 a.m.
688134,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B00005V9I6,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 2]","""3 A.M."" takes a film noir view of the life of 3 taxi cab drivers in the Big Apple circa 2001. It stars Danny Glover and Michelle Rodriguez and was directed by Spike Lee prot&eacute;g&eacute; Lee Davis.Danny Glover (1946) is best known from his ""Lethal Weapon"" series and from his work on TV where he earned 4 Emmy nominations (""Lonesome Dove"", ""Mandela"" ""Freedom Song""). Since 1979 he has appeared in more than 50 films. Glover plays an ex-basketball player who is having problems committing to his waitress girlfriend played by Pam Grier.Pam Grier (1949) is one of the premier Black actresses of the late 20th century, appearing in such films as ""The Big Doll House"" (1971), ""Foxy Brown"" (1974), ""Fort Apache The Bronx"" (1981), ""Above the Law"" (1988), ""The Package"" (1989), ""Escape from LA"" (1996), ""Mars Attack"" (1996) and ""Jackie Brown"" (1997).Michelle Rodriguez (1978) made her film debut in ""Girlfight"" (2000) and this was her second film. She's been in more than a dozen films including ""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001), ""Resident Evil"" (2002), ""Machette"" (2010), and ""Battle LA"" (2011). Rodriguez plays a moody Puerto Rican haunted by her past.Sergej Trifunovic (1972) plays a Bosnian cab driver haunted by the atrocities in his homeland.Sarita Choudhury (1966) plays the owner of the poorly named Lucky Lady Cab Company, who is trying desperately to get enough money to keep the company going. She made her film debut in ""Mississippi Masala"" (1991).Hulky and ubiquitous Mike Starr (1950) plays Grier's boss, the owner of a diner. Starr does his usual great job in a supporting role. You'll remember him best as the Whitney Houston's bodyguard in ""The Bodyguard"" (1992) and from the 100+ gangster films he's been in.Lee Davis is the writer and director. This was his writing and directing debut and his only full length feature to date. Prior to this he worked as a crew member on various Spike Lee films.There are several problems with this film, not the least of which is that everyone seems to be having a lot of problems so there is very little uplifting. Maybe everyone who works as a cab driver has a miserable life, but surely there was something more upbeat that could be inserted. After all, ""Taxi"" was a major hit on TV for many years and it managed to give us a collection of people who were not so buried in the murk.The other main problem with the film is that this type of episodic revolving plot requires a master director to switch between characters and still maintain the momentum of the story. It's difficult to do and it's why so many of these types of ensemble films fail, or at least, do not succeed as well as they might. Robert Altman was a master of this craft. Spike Lee does a good job with this genre. Unfortunately, Davis does not stack up to these levels. The result is a less than satisfactory collection of stories, even though the film is populated with very good actors doing very good jobs.This isn't a bad film, but neither is there anything here to recommend it, apart from the strong performances.",3,Good performances in a mediocre film,1304640000,"05 6, 2011",2011,3044,"['3', 'A.M.', 'film', 'noir', 'view', 'life', '3', 'taxi', 'cab', 'drivers', 'Big', 'Apple', 'circa', '2001', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'was', 'directed', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Lee', 'Davis.Danny', 'Glover', '1946', 'best', 'known', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'series', 'work', 'TV', 'where', 'earned', '4', 'Emmy', 'nominations', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'Mandela', 'Freedom', 'Song', '1979', 'appeared', 'more', '50', 'films', 'Glover', 'ex-basketball', 'player', 'who', 'having', 'problems', 'committing', 'waitress', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Pam', 'Grier.Pam', 'Grier', '1949', 'one', 'premier', 'Black', 'actresses', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'appearing', 'such', 'films', 'Big', 'Doll', 'House', '1971', 'Foxy', 'Brown', '1974', 'Fort', 'Apache', 'Bronx', '1981', 'Law', '1988', 'Package', '1989', 'Escape', 'LA', '1996', 'Mars', 'Attack', '1996', 'Jackie', 'Brown', '1997', '.Michelle', 'Rodriguez', '1978', 'made', 'film', 'debut', 'Girlfight', '2000', 'was', 'second', 'film', 'been', 'more', 'dozen', 'films', 'including', 'Fast', 'Furious', '2001', 'Resident', 'Evil', '2002', 'Machette', '2010', 'Battle', 'LA', '2011', 'Rodriguez', 'moody', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'haunted', 'past.Sergej', 'Trifunovic', '1972', 'Bosnian', 'cab', 'driver', 'haunted', 'atrocities', 'homeland.Sarita', 'Choudhury', '1966', 'owner', 'poorly', 'named', 'Lucky', 'Lady', 'Cab', 'Company', 'who', 'trying', 'desperately', 'get', 'enough', 'money', 'keep', 'company', 'going', 'made', 'film', 'debut', 'Mississippi', 'Masala', '1991', '.Hulky', 'ubiquitous', 'Mike', 'Starr', '1950', 'Grier', 'boss', 'owner', 'diner', 'Starr', 'usual', 'great', 'job', 'supporting', 'role', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'best', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'bodyguard', 'Bodyguard', '1992', '100+', 'gangster', 'films', 'been', 'in.Lee', 'Davis', 'writer', 'director', 'was', 'writing', 'directing', 'debut', 'only', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'date', 'Prior', 'worked', 'crew', 'member', 'various', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'are', 'several', 'problems', 'film', 'not', 'least', 'everyone', 'be', 'having', 'lot', 'problems', 'very', 'little', 'uplifting', 'Maybe', 'everyone', 'who', 'cab', 'driver', 'miserable', 'life', 'surely', 'was', 'something', 'more', 'upbeat', 'could', 'be', 'inserted', 'Taxi', 'was', 'major', 'hit', 'TV', 'many', 'years', 'managed', 'give', 'collection', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'buried', 'murk.The', 'other', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'type', 'episodic', 'revolving', 'plot', 'master', 'director', 'switch', 'characters', 'still', 'maintain', 'momentum', 'story', 'difficult', 'do', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'types', 'ensemble', 'films', 'fail', 'least', 'do', 'not', 'succeed', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'was', 'master', 'craft', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'good', 'job', 'genre', 'Unfortunately', 'Davis', 'not', 'stack', 'up', 'levels', 'result', 'less', 'satisfactory', 'collection', 'stories', 'even', 'film', 'populated', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'doing', 'very', 'good', 'jobs.This', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'there', 'anything', 'here', 'recommend', 'apart', 'strong', 'performances']",3 a.m.

688136,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005V9I6,Joe Sherry,"[11, 18]","After seeing Girlfight I was excited about the new young actress Michelle Rodriguez.  If anyone needs to see a phenomenal debut film, that would be the one.  Girlfight marked Rodriguez as a new talent to watch.  Her subsequent films (Fast and the Furious, Resident Evil, and even Blue Crush) have all played on the tough girl theme that was introduced in Girlfight.  I was trying to find all of the movies in which she had acted in the hopes that a performance would measure up to her first.  While nothing has measured up to her first movie, in my search for her movies, I found something called 3 AM.  I had never heard of this movie before, and since it co-starred Danny Glover and Pam Grier, I figured this was some independent movie that slipped under the radar.  I gave it a rent and sat down to watch it.  When the opening credits rolled, I found out that this was a Showtime movie.  It probably never had a theatrical release and until it came out on DVD was likely only shown on Showtime.  While there is excellent programming on cable (Band of Brothers, The Sopranos, etc), finding out that it is a made for Showtime movie does not inspire confidence, regardless of the actors involved.The story follows several cabdrivers in New York City.  There is a serial killer out there who is targeting cabbies, and there is a lot of fear amongst the cabbies wondering who is going to be next.  As the killings continue, it hits closer to home as a cabdriver friend is killed.  Danny Glover plays a cabdriver who is in love with Pam Grier (a waitress).  Michelle Rodriguez plays a young cabbie trying to pay her rent, but is haunted by visions of her past.  Yes, Rodriguez is still playing to type as her character is the tough girl, somewhat angry.  She plays it well, but at some point Michelle is going to have to stop playing variations on the same character.This is a fairly disappointing movie.  Despite being acted by some top line talents and being produced (with a cameo appearance) by Spike Lee, this movie is just not very good.  I wanted very much to like this movie, but I just couldn't.
