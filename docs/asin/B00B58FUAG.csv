1622094,A22M4O4HRKK3S2,B00B58FUAG,David Holubetz,"[1, 2]","Ok, so that's kind of a stupid name to give my review ...Family Weekend was surprisingly good !  Seemed like it could go either way a number of times, but it kept me entertained the whole way through.  The acting by Olesya Rulin was excellent.  She is beautiful, and a joy to watch on screen.  Most of the film she is prim and proper, and only at the end does she let her hair down.  Mom and Dad are stereotyped but still somewhat believable.  Joey King is fantastic as a little girl who copies scenes from movies perfectly.  She could have stolen the film if they'd let her.  All the characters were strong, even though some were hard to like.It was interesting to see how Emily's character started out so clear about how things should be, and came up with a very organized plan for rebuilding her world by remaking her parents.  As the film progresses, she starts to question all this, and to see elements of their dysfunction showing up in her own life.  By the end, she is forced to realize they are human, and therefore imperfect people.  And as much as she is mad at her family for being wrapped up only in their own lives, she has to see that she is pretty much the same.It's like Little Miss Sunshine meets American Beauty !  Picture that ...One thing I can't figure is the swearing and sexual references.  I thought it was all tasteful and fine, but because it is a movie about family togetherness and the way that can disintegrate over time, it has a pertinent and powerful message for families - which will be missed because people won't watch it with (young) kids.  I wonder what target audience the film makers were going for.  It's not that there's anything really bad, but I don't think I would show it to young kids, who would probably like the movie because of the theme of getting your parents to pay attention to you, just because of that.  I don't know - maybe it would float over their heads.  Hard to say.  Sometimes movies or books about kids are not really made for kids.  This may be one of those.",4,Little Miss Jump Rope,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,2022,"['Ok', 'kind', 'stupid', 'name', 'give', 'review', 'Family', 'Weekend', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Seemed', 'could', 'go', 'way', 'number', 'times', 'kept', 'entertained', 'whole', 'way', 'acting', 'Olesya', 'Rulin', 'was', 'excellent', 'beautiful', 'joy', 'watch', 'screen', 'Most', 'film', 'prim', 'proper', 'only', 'end', 'let', 'hair', 'down', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'are', 'stereotyped', 'still', 'somewhat', 'believable', 'Joey', 'King', 'fantastic', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'scenes', 'movies', 'perfectly', 'could', 'have', 'stolen', 'film', ""'d"", 'let', 'characters', 'were', 'strong', 'even', 'were', 'hard', 'like.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'Emily', 'character', 'started', 'out', 'so', 'clear', 'how', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'came', 'up', 'very', 'organized', 'plan', 'rebuilding', 'world', 'remaking', 'parents', 'film', 'question', 'see', 'elements', 'dysfunction', 'showing', 'up', 'own', 'life', 'end', 'forced', 'realize', 'are', 'human', 'therefore', 'imperfect', 'people', 'as', 'much', 'mad', 'family', 'being', 'wrapped', 'up', 'only', 'own', 'lives', 'see', 'pretty', 'much', 'same.It', 'like', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'meets', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Picture', 'One', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'swearing', 'sexual', 'references', 'thought', 'was', 'tasteful', 'fine', 'movie', 'family', 'togetherness', 'way', 'can', 'disintegrate', 'time', 'pertinent', 'powerful', 'message', 'families', 'will', 'be', 'missed', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'young', 'kids', 'wonder', 'what', 'target', 'audience', 'film', 'makers', 'were', 'going', 'not', 'anything', 'really', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'show', 'young', 'kids', 'who', 'would', 'probably', 'movie', 'theme', 'getting', 'parents', 'pay', 'attention', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'would', 'float', 'heads', 'Hard', 'say', 'movies', 'books', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'made', 'kids', 'may', 'be', 'one']",Family Weekend

1622097,A2H4AWIOK1REMX,B00B58FUAG,"J. C Clark ""eanna""","[1, 2]","I watched this because I like Kristin Chenoweth. She is a fine actress, and this story allows her edgy over the top willingness to do anything to percolate perfectly through the character. However, the all-too-zany family is hard to take. (And Mr. Modine is, as usual, limp and ineffectual--though his character is just that.) I realize this is a comedy, and a silly one at that, but the children are all so ""creative"" and intense that the story gets lost at times. And a fine story it is at heart. A young girl wants her self-absorbed and selfish parents to accept the roles they once did, as parents. Not perfect parents, not heroes, not some Oprah-fied gladiators performing the world's toughest job, just parents doing what they should do. And could do, if they thought about their children as much as they think about themselves.And it has a nice examination at how plans can get out of hand. People plan, but life doesn't always cooperate. And life bats last.Some funny stuff, some great slapstick, some tender moments, some sharp lines. Overall, not perfect, not something I will watch again, but definitely worth a look. Far too many parents have indeed abrogated the once-natural roles of the task, and the consequences have been frightening. And its not just poor parents who have done so. The emotionally stunted and desperate children can live in million dollar home as well as dingy apartments. Children need a parent's love, heck, they need the love of two parents, and when one (or both) is absent, whether physically or just emotionally, the children suffer.So laugh as we see the result of that suffering.

1622098,A2Z3643FSM4PAQ,B00B58FUAG,Joe Smart,"[9, 11]","Surprisingly charming comedy about a teen who drugs and ties up her parents in a desperate attempt to get them to notice her and her siblings.  In a way this is a kiddie version of the Kevin Spacey movie The Ref.  The first two thirds or so before the movie turns schmaltzy are energetic and funny and the cast is uniformly fine.  However, some parents might find scenes in Family Weekend inappropriate for their smaller children.  The most obvious example would be the main character's little sister played by Joey King (Ramona and Beezus) who fancies herself an actress and during the early film is frequently in character as Iris, the child prostitute that Jodie Foster portrayed in Taxi Driver, complete with surprisingly salty language.  She gets the film's biggest laughs but some parents probably won't find a seven year old swearing and talking about her sexual parts funny.  Other R rated movies she acts out scenes from include Reservoir Dogs and Dog Day Afternoon, although the humor in these scenes will probably go over your kids heads--that is, unless you are as bad of a parent as the ones in the film.  Family Weekend is funny and sweet and ultimately heartwarming, but if you plan to watch it with your kids keep in mind that it's a little naughty as well.",4,Charming,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,1273,"['Surprisingly', 'charming', 'comedy', 'teen', 'who', 'drugs', 'up', 'parents', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'get', 'notice', 'siblings', 'way', 'kiddie', 'version', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'movie', 'Ref', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'so', 'movie', 'schmaltzy', 'are', 'energetic', 'funny', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'fine', 'However', 'parents', 'might', 'find', 'scenes', 'Family', 'Weekend', 'inappropriate', 'smaller', 'children', 'most', 'obvious', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'little', 'sister', 'played', 'Joey', 'King', 'Ramona', 'Beezus', 'who', 'actress', 'early', 'film', 'frequently', 'character', 'Iris', 'child', 'prostitute', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'portrayed', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'complete', 'surprisingly', 'salty', 'language', 'film', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'parents', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'swearing', 'talking', 'sexual', 'parts', 'funny', 'Other', 'R', 'rated', 'movies', 'out', 'scenes', 'include', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'humor', 'scenes', 'will', 'probably', 'go', 'over', 'kids', 'heads', 'are', 'bad', 'parent', 'ones', 'film', 'Family', 'Weekend', 'funny', 'sweet', 'ultimately', 'heartwarming', 'plan', 'watch', 'kids', 'keep', 'mind', 'little', 'naughty', 'well']",Family Weekend

1622100,ANGNKTK2J7JFF,B00B58FUAG,Madeline,"[4, 5]","Last night I saw this movie on Netflix, but then went over to Amazon to immediately buy this movie. Why? Because it's just that good. Kristin Chenoweth is one of the most underrated actress in Hollywood--spot on every time. She has impeccable comedic timing and facial expressions. But this movie is certainly more than just Kristin--and it would have to be to really succeed as this is very much an ensemble production.Relative newcomer Olesya Rulin (that is if you don't count small parts in ""High School Musical"" trilogy), is a total standout in this role, and also carries much of the emotional balance of the movie on her shoulders. She plays Emily, an uptight and often more disciplined kid than the rest of the adults in the movie (much less in real life), but is also a kid who sometimes makes horrifically bad decisions. I really think Olesya deserves much of the credit in turning what  could have been a cheesy and wholly unbelievable slapstick comedy made for ABC Family, into a nuanced subversive intimate portrait of an extreme version of what many modern families actually are like--and the consequences and emotional impact of when that family unit breaks down.That being said--this movie is also hysterical. It probably helps if you have both an appreciation for modern art as well as a little knowledge about it's history (Warhol, Pollack etc.) as there are several sight gags as well as verbal jokes that otherwise would be missed. Matthew Modine as the free spirited stoner parent/painter is equally deplorable as well as adorable. He also is practically pitch perfect in his role-really everyone in this movie carries their own weight--even the child actors. Joey King's acting out of several characters and scenes from ""Taxi Driver"" as well as ""Reservoir Dogs"" is equally uncomfortable as she's just a child as well as side clutching hilarious (much like Chlo Moretz's role in ""Kick-A**"").It's funny, but I actually wanted to show this movie to some tweens I regularly babysit as I thought they would both enjoy it simply as entertainment--but that it also might help them deal with some of the issues dealt with in the movie that pretty much all teenagers go through. Then I realized that this movie was rated R, and decided I might wait a year or two as the R content though very mild and brief is still probably pushing the line too far for where the tweens are at right now. However, I have no doubt that I will eventually show this movie to them, and that they will both enjoy it as well as appreciate the emotions and themes the movies deals with.Very funny, very heartwarming. Recommended for ages mature teens-mid 20s, and parents of young teenagers as well.***Side notes, if you happen to see the main trailer for this movie--it looks super dumb and cheesy.

The film opens with everything pristine white, neat and orderly. It is an ideal household on the surface. This world quickly falls apart as we discover the family has drifted apart. The family cast of characters:Dad (Matthew Modine) is a has-been artist. He smokes pot and sleeps a lot. He is a 60's hippie type.Mom (Kristin Chenoweth) is the family bread winner. She is a workaholic and the least likeable of the family.Emily (Olesya Rulin) is the centerpiece to this tale. She jumps rope competitively and would love some family support.Jack (Eddie Hassell) is the older son who describes himself as a ""raging homosexual."" He makes short features for the Internet and wants to be called ""Thor.""Lucy (Joey King) is my favorite. She loves movies and fancies herself an actress. When we first meet her she has immersed herself into ""Iris"" the child prostitute from ""Taxi.""Mickey (Robbie Tucker) is the introverted young son who memorizes every spoken word. No one ever questions his memory.Grandma Gale or GG (Shirley Jones) is The father's mother and doesn't get along with his wife. She is somewhat New Age in this film.When everyone in the family missed Emily's semi-final jump rope competition she is upset and devises an over the top plan to force her parents to act like parents. I was laughing out loud over the antics and at Lucy.Joey King was fantastic as she assumed multiple film roles, none of which any parent would allow a nine year old to watch. At the end, the film then shifts to heart warming mode as do most indie comedies.Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb, no sex or nudity.
