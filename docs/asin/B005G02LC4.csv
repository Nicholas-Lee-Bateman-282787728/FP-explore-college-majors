And ex gay porn star Brent Corrigan stars in the segment ""I Was A Teenage Werebear"".

1459640,AV30RYVPJJJ34,B005G02LC4,Alexander Stephen Brown,"[1, 2]","This movie pays great homage to the old drive in flicks. Like when Grindhouse was released with ""Death Proof"" and ""Planet Terror"" those movies were intended to have the grimy effect, like the original Grindhouse movies. The over the top bad effects and melodramatic acting is all intended as that is what drive ins produced.  Personally, I think the movie was brilliant as it recapped on styles originated by Hershel Gordon Lewis, John Waters, Ed Wood etc. This is not supposed to be taken seriously by any means but is intended to the viewer, movie buff, to be a homage to some of the most tasteless movies ever made.  Also, let me note that for those who aren't movie buffs in the 50s - 70s , it almost seemed that you were with the in crowd if  you did a tasteless movie, example, ""Pink Flamingos"" ""Attack of The Killer Tomatoes"" ""Blood Feast"" so on and so fourth.  None of these movies had a big budget or academy award winning actors but they have stood the test of time because they are so awful they are good.  Besides the success of how awful but good ""Troll 2"" is, this is perhaps my favorite worst modern movie.For those interested in seeing this after the rant,  you will see melodramatic performances that are intended to be bad, effects that are intended to look cheap, and toilet humor.  Viewers will be introduced to four stories 1. Wadzilla (a giant sperm) 2. I Was a Teenage Wearbear (a homage piece to beach musical movies with a teenage werewolf feel but it gay oriented so it becomes wearbear.) 3. The Diary of Anne Frankenstein (which is homage to the movies where you had a famous name meet with a monster, example Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein, however the dialog isn't as nice as those old movies) 4. Zom-b-Movie (is a recap on zombie flicks and sleaze, it reminded me of a SNL spoof I saw a long time ago titled, ""Attack of the Masturbating Zombies"".)In conclusion, this movie isn't for everyone, to start with you have to admire bad taste and if you haven't found the art that bad taste has to offer, start with the master directors I listed above such as John Waters. After watching the classics, I think most haters will enjoy this piece more.  Good work guys on writing and directing this!

Not at all, actually... CHILLERAMA is in contention with CREEPSHOW 3 and SNOOP DOGG'S HOOD OF HORROR for the title of worst omnibus film ever made. It is vulgar and childish, but worst of all, it is dreadfully boring.America's last drive-in is shutting its doors forever, but not before putting on one final show: It's Chillerama, featuring four ghoulish tales of terror! Up first, a giant mutant sperm cell goes on a rampage through New York City in WADZILLA! Then, a young teen fights his confusing new urges in I WAS A TEENAGE WEREBEAR. Next, Hitler develops the ultimate killing machine using THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANKENSTEIN. Finally, some tainted popcorn turns an entire theater audience into a pack of oversexed zombies in ZOM-B-MOVIE.It is impossible to pick a favorite here. Literally impossible, because they are all so terrible. Instead of producing a campy satire of the drive-in fodder that was produced over the past forty years, we are given a cheesy spoof, and an idiotic one at that. Each of the stories begin with a silly enough premise, which quickly outlives the humor of the shorts, themselves. Any of the talent that these directors have displayed in the past is lost on CHILLERAMA, and instead traded in for stupid dick and fart jokes. The special effects are meant to imitate the films from these eras, and if looking awful was the goal, they certainly achieved it. While each of the entries drag on indefinitely, Tim Sullivan's gay werewolf musical simply becomes unbearable. He even makes the mistake of hiring his own Scream Queens winner Gabby West, proving once and for all that the show was a sham given her ridiculous performance.

Chillerama proves that you don't ned insane budgets to make a movie. But I really wish these guys had worked a bit harder to actually make a good movie. Each of the segments have their moments but Wadzilla is the best with it's perfect reproduction of the look of those old color Technicolor saturated Sci-fi/Horror movies of the 50's and 60's. But Wadzilla and all of the other stories go to far into outright slapstick. I would have liked to have seen a mix up of not only styles but also of tone. It's jokey to the point of being obnoxious.Speaking of which, co-Director Tim Sullivan (Were-bear) really got on my nerves. Now, I don't want to be called a homophobe for picking on the guy because I've been a big fan of his for years with the writing he did for Fangoria magazine, but he was really irritating. He talks over people and interrupts every other second and when other people are trying to get a word in he starts fidgeting and moving his lips like he's waiting for people to catch a breath so he can interject. He's the reason that I had to turn off the commentary because it got graiting after 15 minutes.Speaking of the commentary, the idea of showing these guys recording it, in frame, is interesting in theory but the reality is that you just see four guys sitting there and chatting. I think it would also have been better if each Director did their commentary seperately so they could talk in detail about their work without Sullivan interrupting and at the same time letting him natter on about Were-Bear because I did actually want to hear what he had to say about his segment.The extras were dissapointing, especially since a movie like this relies on DVD and Blu-Ray sales. I bought it on BR and I would have liked to have seen ""making of"" docs on all of the segments but we only got one for Anne Frankenstein that was longer then the actual segement!?! The rest is some deleted scene's and two interviews, from the same convention, and little else.

The in-between segments which lead to Zom-B-Movie I thought were done well with cool looking effects and gore, and lots of nods to movies like Star Wars, Die Hard and the Goonies. Overall it's a really cool way to waste an hour and a half, clearly this movie was made by people who love B grade horror cinema and it shows. There is some decent female nudity, although it could have used more, and the effects were cool (crappy looking on purpose) this movie is really cool to watch during the fall like I just did. This is the kind of movie that could benefit from a sequel or maybe an extended cut. The two segments I didn't really care for kind of hurt the movie overall for me, had they been stronger this easily would have been a great movie. I like obvious nods and homages paid to Grindhouse and Troma films. If you can get this at a cheap price, it's well worth a viewing.

1459656,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B005G02LC4,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 1]","This aptly named episodic doesn't take itself too seriously--or seriously at all, really.  Its highly inappropriate gross-out humor smacks of Kaufman's Troma films and the more recent, exploitative Tokyo Shock films from Sushi Typhoon.  So don't go watching this with your mother.  The dialogue is littered with poorly executed horror clich&eacute;s-gone-wrong, blatant sexual innuendo and raunchy harbingers of T'n'A to come.  You know this is going to be awful, but you also know that the filmmakers were intentionally making something awful.  The question is whether or not they succeeded at making something so bad it's good.  Not really.  I laughed here and there, but mostly felt guilty for watching this smut.  I'll say it again just so that you truly understand what this is: filthy SMUT!This is pure, trashy nonsense.  In the intro scene a man digs up his dead wife to get some ""dead head,"" but he gets more than he bargained for when she zombie-chomps his junk off.  This guy, now penisless, goes to work at a drive-in theater where they'll be showing the other featurettes comprising this movie.  This side-story, Zom-B Movie, continues between and after the featurettes.Wadzilla is our first featurette and it copies the ""giant monster"" fad of the old days.  It's about an average Joe with abnormally few, large, and sluggish sperm.  After a consult with a doctor at a sperm bank, he agrees to take Spermopropene, a drug which may increase his sperm load.  They make this every bit as idiotic as you'd think they could.  The drug makes his sperm into giant sperm (i.e., two inches of disgustingly inappropriate sperm wriggling across the floor like a slapstick nightcrawler).  The short film continues and his sperm size grows to a foot long.  He literally battles one in a bathroom prior to a blind date.  This rogue sperm grows rapidly, tries to rape a woman, eats a chihuahua and beheads some chick in a sock-hop skirt.  This gamete-gone-wrong gets so big that they use claymation to present it to the tune of Beetlejuice's sandworms.  It continues to kill and grow.  Just as this Wadzilla is humping the sultry Statue of Liberty, which gives us a striptease by the way, General Bukake (Eric Roberts) initiates ""operation money shot"" to save the day.I Was a Teenage Werebear borrows from the beach movie craze of the 50s and 60s and even has a few painful musical numbers.  This homoerotic tale is initiated after a bite to the butt from a blond, Elvis-ish greaser.  Once aroused, such men transform into plus-sized, unmanscaped beasts.  The make-up for this is utterly terrible.  This is much less entertaining than Wadzilla.  In the end, the recently-turned star of the story slays his maker with a big, chrome...well, you know what...to the...well, you know where.  Just tasteless.  Next to this, Zombie Strippers starts looking like a solid film.The Diary of Anne Frankenstein is in black and white, and German!  These short films just seem to get worse and worse.  So Adolf Hitler kills the Frank family, shortened from Frankenstein, and steals the journal of Dr. Frankenstein.  Now armed with the secrets of creation, Hitler goes all mad scientist and creates a Jewish Frankenstein played by Kane Hodder (Jason Voorhees in Friday the 13th parts VII-X).  This was funny and the least inappropriate of the shorts.  If you make it this far into the movie, listen for all of the non-German nonsense dialogue.  It's loaded with random movie references--in fact, the whole movie is filled with seriously out of place movie quotables.After all this, Zom-B Movie comes to its horrendous conclusion with something of an exploitative nymphomaniac zombie orgy complete with necrophilia, sexualized gore and member dismemberment.This movie, for its style and quality, has a disturbing number of recognizable actors.  It's filmed and scored as if mocking 50s-60s era horror and sci-fi and was clearly made to give exploitation film fans a satirical period piece.",3,Fans of Tokyo Shock and Troma films should delight in this gross-out comedic smutfest.,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,3970,"['aptly', 'named', 'episodic', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'seriously', 'really', 'highly', 'inappropriate', 'gross-out', 'humor', 'smacks', 'Kaufman', 'Troma', 'films', 'more', 'recent', 'exploitative', 'Tokyo', 'Shock', 'films', 'Sushi', 'Typhoon', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'watching', 'mother', 'dialogue', 'littered', 'poorly', 'executed', 'horror', 'clich', 'eacute', 's-gone-wrong', 'blatant', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'raunchy', 'harbingers', 'T', 'n', 'come', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'awful', 'also', 'know', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'intentionally', 'making', 'something', 'awful', 'question', 'not', 'succeeded', 'making', 'something', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'Not', 'really', 'laughed', 'here', 'there', 'mostly', 'felt', 'guilty', 'watching', 'smut', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'just', 'so', 'truly', 'understand', 'what', 'filthy', 'SMUT', 'pure', 'trashy', 'nonsense', 'intro', 'scene', 'man', 'up', 'dead', 'wife', 'get', 'dead', 'head', 'more', 'bargained', 'when', 'zombie-chomps', 'junk', 'off', 'guy', 'now', 'penisless', 'work', 'drive-in', 'theater', 'where', ""'ll"", 'be', 'showing', 'other', 'featurettes', 'comprising', 'movie', 'side-story', 'Zom-B', 'Movie', 'featurettes.Wadzilla', 'first', 'featurette', 'giant', 'monster', 'fad', 'old', 'days', 'average', 'Joe', 'abnormally', 'few', 'large', 'sluggish', 'sperm', 'consult', 'doctor', 'sperm', 'bank', 'take', 'Spermopropene', 'drug', 'may', 'increase', 'sperm', 'load', 'make', 'bit', 'as', 'idiotic', ""'d"", 'think', 'could', 'drug', 'sperm', 'giant', 'sperm', 'i.e.', 'two', 'inches', 'disgustingly', 'inappropriate', 'sperm', 'wriggling', 'floor', 'slapstick', 'nightcrawler', 'short', 'film', 'sperm', 'size', 'grows', 'foot', 'long', 'literally', 'one', 'bathroom', 'prior', 'blind', 'date', 'rogue', 'sperm', 'grows', 'rapidly', 'tries', 'rape', 'woman', 'chihuahua', 'beheads', 'chick', 'sock-hop', 'skirt', 'gamete-gone-wrong', 'so', 'big', 'use', 'claymation', 'present', 'tune', 'Beetlejuice', 'sandworms', 'kill', 'grow', 'Just', 'Wadzilla', 'humping', 'sultry', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'striptease', 'way', 'General', 'Bukake', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'operation', 'money', 'shot', 'save', 'day.I', 'Was', 'Teenage', 'Werebear', 'borrows', 'beach', 'movie', 'craze', '50s', '60s', 'even', 'few', 'painful', 'musical', 'numbers', 'homoerotic', 'tale', 'initiated', 'bite', 'butt', 'blond', 'Elvis-ish', 'greaser', 'Once', 'aroused', 'such', 'men', 'transform', 'plus-sized', 'unmanscaped', 'beasts', 'make-up', 'utterly', 'terrible', 'much', 'less', 'entertaining', 'Wadzilla', 'end', 'recently-turned', 'star', 'story', 'maker', 'big', 'chrome', 'well', 'know', 'what', 'well', 'know', 'where', 'Just', 'tasteless', 'Next', 'Zombie', 'Strippers', 'looking', 'solid', 'film.The', 'Diary', 'Anne', 'Frankenstein', 'black', 'white', 'German', 'short', 'films', 'just', 'seem', 'get', 'worse', 'worse', 'So', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'Frank', 'family', 'shortened', 'Frankenstein', 'journal', 'Dr.', 'Frankenstein', 'Now', 'armed', 'secrets', 'creation', 'Hitler', 'mad', 'scientist', 'Jewish', 'Frankenstein', 'played', 'Kane', 'Hodder', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'Friday', '13th', 'parts', 'VII-X', 'was', 'funny', 'least', 'inappropriate', 'shorts', 'make', 'far', 'movie', 'listen', 'non-German', 'nonsense', 'dialogue', 'loaded', 'random', 'movie', 'references', 'fact', 'whole', 'movie', 'filled', 'seriously', 'place', 'movie', 'quotables.After', 'Zom-B', 'Movie', 'horrendous', 'conclusion', 'something', 'exploitative', 'nymphomaniac', 'zombie', 'orgy', 'complete', 'necrophilia', 'sexualized', 'gore', 'member', 'dismemberment.This', 'movie', 'style', 'quality', 'disturbing', 'number', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'filmed', 'scored', 'mocking', '50s-60s', 'era', 'horror', 'sci-fi', 'was', 'clearly', 'made', 'give', 'exploitation', 'film', 'fans', 'satirical', 'period', 'piece']",N/A
1459657,A19L14G82I6SEE,B005G02LC4,"Kat ""Reviewer @ Shivers Of Horror""","[4, 9]","Edited for reposting on Amazon. For unedited full length version please visit Shivers of Horror (link in profile) my horror movie/book review blogThe movie starts off with a guy digging up his dead wife. She's mummified and he's drinking and complaining about never getting his ""needs"" fulfilled. So he whips out his you know what for a little ""dead head"" and she comes to life and bites it off. The guy wonders off through a Drive-in showing a bunch of ""splatter"" films. There we meet a few different characters. Between each movie showing at the drive-in we are taken back to a few of these characters for their wrap-around zombie story.The first story begins with ""Wadzilla"". The story of a guy who attempts to donate sperm but is turned down because he only ever shoots out one, and its sluggish. The Dr (Ray Wise) gives him an experimental drug to help him out with his problem. The medication has bad results however. Every time he gets aroused his sperm enlarges so its super painful. He's told to stop taking the medication, and every time he feels pain to quickly masturbate and get the sperm out of him. Of course, he keeps getting aroused and his sperm keep getting bigger and bigger and eventually one takes over New York....This one had that ""old drive-in"" look too it. It wasn't crisp quality like one would think from a BluRay DVD. But seeing as how its an ""old"" movie people are watching at a drive-in that's to be expected.Next up is ""I was a Teenage Werebear"". This one starts out with a teen and a girl getting it on in a van. The two teens break into song...which was really funny, because it reminded me of Grease a little before they even started singing and I wasn`t expecting a musical at all from this film. Anyhow, these three guys show up, they look like a toss up of some 50s greasers and BSDM bondage homosexuals. The whole vibe of them in the first 5 minutes from being on screen was like a mix between the T-Birds (again from Grease) and The Lost Boys (they use some lines from that movie actually, so my feeling was correct). When the ""werebears"" get pissed off they morph into guys in leather with wolf faces. The musical aspect of the story was funny..especially the ""love bit me on the a**"" part. But if your looking for people who can sing, don't expect much.This one looked crisp and clear, exactly what you'd expect from a BluRay DVD. This one was really done in the style of those 60s beach musical films, and while it was entertaining to me quickly became boring by the end.Next up was ""The Diary of Anne Frankenstein"", I honestly thought I'd love this segment because its Adam Green's and Kane Hodder is in it. But I was extremely disappointed that I had to read subtitles for the entire thing. If I wanted to read subtitles I'd watch a foreign movie. Because of this, I lost interest FAST...in fact, I had to stop the movie briefly (which I hate doing when I'm going to be reviewing it, but it was out of my control unfortunately) and I just dragged on getting back to it because I didn't want to finish this segment.Anyhow, the basic plot to this one is that the Nazi's find Anne Frank and her family and kill them. They get a book with the instructions on how to make ""Frankenstein's Monster"" as the Franks were really Frankenstein's. So, they build a monster who looks like a mesh between a rabbi and Frankenstein's monster.This one was sorta done with that ""backyard"" feeling. Not so much the acting. But the concept of the story. It took a serious subject matter (Nazi's, Anne Frank, and Hitler) and made a comedy out of it. So those that might be offended shouldn't watch. You had scenes where it was obviously a set, or an actor was replaced by another actor for a minute and then switched back. While this was all done on purpose. I just did not like this story at all.""Deathication"", it's the last ""movie"" playing at the drive-in. I briefly read another review midway through watching this, and someone said they had to skip over it because it was so disgusting. Of course that just made me more curious because the rest of the movie hadn't been gross at all...In the beginning of this ""segment"" there is a warning...and well, you can kinda guess what's coming based on the title and what they talk about...defecation. This isn't really a ""story"" within the movie, its more like the beginning of a bunch of random clips of people taking craps on sidewalks, exploding on walls, dogs eating it, etc etc. If you have a weak stomach, this isn't for you, but its over pretty quickly. If you like poo humor, you'll probably find it quite funny. While this plays on the Drive-in screen we get taken back to the characters at the drive-in and the whole Zombie wrap-around storyline which ends the film.The main zombie storyline was entertaining and fun for the brief period of time it took place during, and I really enjoyed all the characters. I liked the whole concept of having an anthology horror film take place at a theater or drive-in and have the wrap around storyline.On top of all the quotes from other movies, there are TONS of cameos. Some I even see listed in the credits and have no idea where they were in the movie. Kane Hodder, Ron Jeremy, Ray Wise, etc. So be on the lookout for those.Bottom line on this movie, if your expecting a serious horror film. Keep looking, this one is NOT it. I honestly probably won't be watching this one again, but hey at least I can say I've seen it now and for what it was, it was actually entertaining for the most part. Given the average overall rating of each segment, and the fact that I don`t normally like B-horror films, I'd probably give this one a 2.5/5 stars total because at least I was somewhat entertained.",2,A let down.

1459658,AMS0KR29YZXCE,B005G02LC4,"Kenneth Sohl ""ksohl@bellsouth.net""","[2, 5]","Over-the-top supposed ""horror-comedy"" that tries to make up for its lack of good material by throwing lots of 3-yr old level toilet humor at the viewer in the hopes that he won't notice that there is very little here.  The various installments (shown as fictional drive-in features) have their moments, but each of them, about 20 minutes long apiece, go on about 15 minutes too long, like a good joke that goes stale fast.  As a child, I loved watching the old Adam West ""Batman"" show, but when I saw it again as an adult, I quickly became annoyed at its unsubtle, in-your-face campiness.  This movie reminds me of that experience, with its initial shock-value wearing off far too quickly, while oblivious film-makers carry on laboring under the delusion that what they are doing is ""comedic"" when, in actuality, it devolved into obnoxiousness long ago.  The best one, I thought, was the B@W ""Diary of Anne Frankenstein"", with its mixture of truly bad taste and Hogan's Hero-esque humor.  The '60-ish film look in the initial ""Wadzilla"" feature was well done (better than the actual story).  The cast did a good job, so don't blame them, they aren't script-writers or directors.  For fans of movies like ""Evil Dead 2"" or ""Feast"", don't expect anything here as there is absolutely no attempt to make an actual horror movie, just a miserably failed attempt at comedy.",1,"No Horror, Few Laughs",1330646400,"03 2, 2012",2012,1365,"['Over-the-top', 'supposed', 'horror-comedy', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'good', 'material', 'throwing', 'lots', '3-yr', 'old', 'level', 'toilet', 'humor', 'viewer', 'hopes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'very', 'little', 'here', 'various', 'installments', 'shown', 'fictional', 'drive-in', 'features', 'have', 'moments', 'about', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'apiece', 'go', 'about', '15', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'good', 'joke', 'stale', 'fast', 'child', 'loved', 'watching', 'old', 'Adam', 'West', 'Batman', 'show', 'when', 'saw', 'again', 'adult', 'quickly', 'became', 'annoyed', 'unsubtle', 'in-your-face', 'campiness', 'movie', 'experience', 'initial', 'shock-value', 'wearing', 'off', 'far', 'too', 'quickly', 'oblivious', 'film-makers', 'carry', 'laboring', 'delusion', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'comedic', 'when', 'actuality', 'devolved', 'obnoxiousness', 'long', 'ago', 'best', 'one', 'thought', 'was', 'B', '@', 'W', 'Diary', 'Anne', 'Frankenstein', 'mixture', 'truly', 'bad', 'taste', 'Hogan', 'Hero-esque', 'humor', ""'60-ish"", 'film', 'look', 'initial', 'Wadzilla', 'feature', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'better', 'actual', 'story', 'cast', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'are', ""n't"", 'script-writers', 'directors', 'fans', 'movies', 'Evil', 'Dead', '2', 'Feast', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'here', 'absolutely', 'attempt', 'make', 'actual', 'horror', 'movie', 'just', 'miserably', 'failed', 'attempt', 'comedy']",N/A

1459660,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005G02LC4,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","It's the closing night at the last drive-in in America and the owner has a special treat in store for his customers: a triple feature of rarely seen classics that he was able to get for this special screening. Fans pack the place and we, DVD renters, are able to see the movies as well. Too bad that they qualify for low B-grade movies.What sounded like a great idea turns out to have few hits and far too many misses. Four current horror feature directors (Adam Rifkin, Joe Lynch, Adam Green and Tim Sullivan) thought this would make a great movie, a collection of short works by each one tied in together with the drive-in motif. Each film has some decent moments but on the whole leave much to be desired.Surrounding the three features on the big outdoor screen is the story of a man who works at the drive-in who digs up his wife for some necrophilia interaction who finds his intended undead and well and able enough to bite down on his manhood. Thus he becomes infected and as the film moves forward he changes into a full blown (no pun intended) zombie who's infected blood and bite change patrons. What could have been a funny idea relies far too much on sex.The movies on the screen begin with ""WADZILLA"", the story of a man whose sperm count is so miniscule as to only offer perhaps one sperm per encounter. A scientist offers him a chance to improve himself with a new drug yet to be tested on humans. The result is a super sperm that almost explodes the moment the young man becomes aroused.  When he goes out on a blind date just meeting the young woman puts him into intense pain. Using her bathroom he ""relieves"" himself but the sperm in question escapes, much like the chest burster from ALIEN. It eventually attacks his date who escapes and the two try to stop the sperm without any luck. With each encounter it becomes bigger and bigger until it's the size of, well, Godzilla. Do they finally stop it? I won't give it away but yes, this one involves some gooey special effects and some very off color jokes.The second film is ""I WAS A TEENAGE WERE-BEAR"". Played out as a tribute to those classic beach films combined with the teenage monster movies, the film has a hero who has yet to have sex with his girlfriend. For some reason he seems more attracted to the tough leather clad bad boys on the beach. Eventually he gets bitten on the behind and discovers to his dismay that he will become a were-bear when the full moon rises. For those who don't know a bear in gay terms is a hairy and full figured male. Can he be accepted for who he is? And is this what he really wants?The third film in the group is ""THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANKENSTEIN"". Yes, it has perhaps the best name of the bunch. In this lost German film we find Hitler discovering the hide out of the Frankenstein family. Not only does he find them but he finds their secret books as well describing how to create a human being. Of course he does so and the result is a definitely Hassidic looking Golem style creation. This movie offers some decent jokes involving the purely made up German sounding language and a number of low budget film making gags. For instance when a German soldier is picked up by the monster and thrown we see a black stand in crash through a table then replaced with the white actor.As I said in between various characters are infected with the zombie virus and by the end of the last film have gone on a rampage in the drive in. Characters we've met throughout are seen fighting them off and whether or not they survive is in question.The movie works in some ways but in others it misses completely. The jokes are far too wrapped up in sex and rarely rise above per-teen humor. Yes, the Wadzilla creature is funny as are some of the jokes around it, but when piled one on top of the other they lose their ability to make you laugh.On the whole fans of B-movies and drive-ins will probably want to take the time to watch this movie. My guess is it would make a great party movie as well. Perhaps it would seem that much funnier if those watching were a little tipsy. It might not be a movie to add to your collection but a single rental would be worthwhile if you're not easily offended.",3,SEMI-LAME TRIBUTE TO THE DRIVE IN FLICK,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4192,"['closing', 'night', 'last', 'drive-in', 'America', 'owner', 'special', 'treat', 'store', 'customers', 'triple', 'feature', 'rarely', 'seen', 'classics', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'special', 'screening', 'Fans', 'pack', 'place', 'DVD', 'renters', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'movies', 'well', 'Too', 'bad', 'qualify', 'low', 'B-grade', 'movies.What', 'sounded', 'great', 'idea', 'out', 'have', 'few', 'hits', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'misses', 'Four', 'current', 'horror', 'feature', 'directors', 'Adam', 'Rifkin', 'Joe', 'Lynch', 'Adam', 'Green', 'Tim', 'Sullivan', 'thought', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'collection', 'short', 'works', 'one', 'tied', 'together', 'drive-in', 'motif', 'film', 'decent', 'moments', 'whole', 'leave', 'much', 'be', 'desired.Surrounding', 'three', 'features', 'big', 'outdoor', 'screen', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'drive-in', 'who', 'up', 'wife', 'necrophilia', 'interaction', 'who', 'intended', 'undead', 'well', 'able', 'enough', 'bite', 'down', 'manhood', 'Thus', 'infected', 'film', 'forward', 'full', 'blown', 'pun', 'intended', 'zombie', 'who', 'infected', 'blood', 'bite', 'change', 'patrons', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'idea', 'relies', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'sex.The', 'movies', 'screen', 'begin', 'WADZILLA', 'story', 'man', 'sperm', 'count', 'so', 'miniscule', 'only', 'offer', 'perhaps', 'one', 'sperm', 'encounter', 'scientist', 'chance', 'improve', 'new', 'drug', 'yet', 'be', 'tested', 'humans', 'result', 'super', 'sperm', 'almost', 'moment', 'young', 'man', 'aroused', 'When', 'out', 'blind', 'date', 'just', 'meeting', 'young', 'woman', 'intense', 'pain', 'Using', 'bathroom', 'relieves', 'sperm', 'question', 'escapes', 'much', 'chest', 'burster', 'ALIEN', 'eventually', 'date', 'who', 'two', 'try', 'stop', 'sperm', 'luck', 'encounter', 'bigger', 'bigger', 'size', 'well', 'Godzilla', 'Do', 'finally', 'stop', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'yes', 'one', 'gooey', 'special', 'effects', 'very', 'color', 'jokes.The', 'second', 'film', 'WAS', 'TEENAGE', 'WERE-BEAR', 'Played', 'out', 'tribute', 'classic', 'beach', 'films', 'combined', 'teenage', 'monster', 'movies', 'film', 'hero', 'who', 'yet', 'have', 'sex', 'girlfriend', 'reason', 'more', 'attracted', 'tough', 'leather', 'clad', 'bad', 'boys', 'beach', 'Eventually', 'bitten', 'behind', 'discovers', 'dismay', 'will', 'become', 'were-bear', 'when', 'full', 'moon', 'rises', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'bear', 'gay', 'terms', 'hairy', 'full', 'figured', 'male', 'Can', 'be', 'accepted', 'who', 'what', 'really', 'third', 'film', 'group', 'THE', 'DIARY', 'OF', 'ANNE', 'FRANKENSTEIN', 'Yes', 'perhaps', 'best', 'name', 'bunch', 'lost', 'German', 'film', 'find', 'Hitler', 'discovering', 'hide', 'Frankenstein', 'family', 'Not', 'only', 'find', 'secret', 'books', 'well', 'describing', 'how', 'create', 'human', 'being', 'course', 'so', 'result', 'definitely', 'Hassidic', 'looking', 'Golem', 'style', 'creation', 'movie', 'decent', 'jokes', 'involving', 'purely', 'made', 'up', 'German', 'sounding', 'language', 'number', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'making', 'gags', 'instance', 'when', 'German', 'soldier', 'picked', 'up', 'monster', 'see', 'black', 'stand', 'crash', 'table', 'then', 'replaced', 'white', 'actor.As', 'said', 'various', 'characters', 'are', 'infected', 'zombie', 'virus', 'end', 'last', 'film', 'have', 'gone', 'rampage', 'drive', 'Characters', ""'ve"", 'met', 'are', 'seen', 'fighting', 'off', 'not', 'survive', 'question.The', 'movie', 'works', 'ways', 'others', 'completely', 'jokes', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'wrapped', 'up', 'sex', 'rarely', 'rise', 'per-teen', 'humor', 'Yes', 'Wadzilla', 'creature', 'funny', 'are', 'jokes', 'when', 'piled', 'one', 'top', 'other', 'lose', 'ability', 'make', 'laugh.On', 'whole', 'fans', 'B-movies', 'drive-ins', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'guess', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'party', 'movie', 'well', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'seem', 'much', 'funnier', 'watching', 'were', 'little', 'tipsy', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'movie', 'add', 'collection', 'single', 'rental', 'would', 'be', 'worthwhile', ""'re"", 'not', 'easily', 'offended']",N/A

1459663,A2DLW47JXRLUTP,B005G02LC4,"Michael D. Sepesy ""egaeus""","[1, 1]","I get it. This movie uses a horror anthology structure to serve up a series of parodies of different types of horror movies. The main problem is that it doesn't care enough about its audience or horror movies to parody them closely enough to make it funny or campy. Instead, it translates everything through a filter of blue humor that is blue without being humorous.  The &#34;Godzilla' style monster movie is now &#34;Wadzilla,&#34; a movie featuring a giant sperm. Sounds like it might have a couple of chuckles, right? You would be wrong. &#34;I Was a Teen-Age Werewolf&#34; is now &#34;I Was a Teen-Age Werebear&#34; in which the &#34;bear&#34; refers to gay slang for a particular physical type. A stream of unfunny gay jokes follow.To sell parodies to other types of movies, it helps to try to simulate the objects of parody in style, etc. The attempt here at that is minimal. Part of the joke then is that the movie seems like the original kind, but departs in ways that are surprising and thus humor is created. This is one of the reasons a movie like YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN was successful. It looked genuine, making the wackiness seem that much more wacky.The segments in Chillerama are ham-handed in their execution. No attempt is made to choose actors that look appropriate for the period. No real attempt is made to make the writing appropriate. Very little attempt is made to make the individual parts stylistically different other than to apply a filter to the films that makes them look like grainy or black and white movies. .Think of the worst &#34;dirty&#34; joke your 10-year-old little brother ever told you and stretch it out to 117 minutes.

1459664,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B005G02LC4,Micheal Hunt,"[1, 2]","Chillerama is a film about a old drive-in movie center that is closing down, so for the final night, the owner is showing a bunch of short horror movies that have never been seen. The film opens with one of the drive-in workers visiting his dead wife to catch up on some good times he never had, only to be infected with a zombie virus. The film introduces a few characters around the drive in, and the workers, then on to the first film WadZilla about a man who has a low sperm count, so his doctor prescribes him a new untested medication that gives the man such a bad side effect that his sperm grows into a Godzilla sized monster. This movie was pretty good, even tho the special effects are laughable, but that was the intention. This film is trying to create some old school style graphics, and they are the best of the worst you can expect.The next movie WearBears. Where a kid is bitten on the butt by a wearbear only to fight them off and not want to become part of their homosexual-flesh eating gang. It reminds me a lot of a Lost Boys, only set on a beach with musical numbers included. Not one of my favorite parts of this film.Next up is a black and white feature where Hitler finds Dr Frankenstein's book which he uses to create his own Jewish Frankenstein monster that he attempts to train to kill. This was my least favorite of the features.Next up is a feature about feces. Doesn't sound like much, and doesn't run very long, but it was the part of the movie I laughed the hardest at. After that is the final act of the movie with a small twist to the end, not much of one, but it closes the film under the title Zombies at the drive in or something along that line.Overall, fans of Troma, will enjoy this gory comedy in the likes of Kentucky Fried Movie. A couple of different features, thrown into one Grindhouse night of terror... well... laughs more likely, but it is a decent flick that I thought I was not going to enjoy, but I am glad I did watch now. It has definitely become a new favorite of mine for the collection. If you like gross, over the top, gory-camp style humor, then this film is a must see. If you have no sense of humor, and think something like ""Friends"" is the greatest show of them all, then yeah, you will hate this film.Bonus Features: Of coarse there is an Audio Commentary. It points out a few things about the movie that I Didn't know about. I was quite surprised that Kane Hodder plays the Frankenstein Monster-esq creature in this movie! I didn't know directors and producers from this movie made Hatchet, nor, Detroit Rock City, so it was a surprise to see Kane was apart of this. Also, Kane is very popular with Friday The 13th fans having played Jason quite a few times. Also, during the commentary a nod to Lloyd Kaufman of Troma, I knew they had to be fans!Wadzilla deleted scenes. Seem to be more extended scenes then anything.The Making of the Diary of Anne Frankenstein. A few behind the scenes and interviews about the making of this segment. Including interviews with Kane Hodder.I was a Teenage Wearbear, a behind the scenes, deleted scenes and trailer to the short film.Zom-B-Movie deleted and extended scenes.A couple of comic-con interviews with the 4 directors, and a couple of trailers to this film that I think might have been made souley for this DVD as a bit of a joke. Either that, or they where just meant to reveal most of the movie in the trailers like old fashioned trailers.Overall the bonus content is great for those of us who want to see and learn more about the film we loved, but, if you hated it, then why did you even wanna know what bonus content was on this?",3,They sure do still make em like this anymore,1326585600,"01 15, 2012",2012,3642,"['Chillerama', 'film', 'old', 'drive-in', 'movie', 'center', 'closing', 'down', 'so', 'final', 'night', 'owner', 'showing', 'bunch', 'short', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'film', 'one', 'drive-in', 'workers', 'visiting', 'dead', 'wife', 'catch', 'up', 'good', 'times', 'never', 'had', 'only', 'be', 'infected', 'zombie', 'virus', 'film', 'few', 'characters', 'drive', 'workers', 'then', 'first', 'film', 'WadZilla', 'man', 'who', 'low', 'sperm', 'count', 'doctor', 'new', 'untested', 'medication', 'man', 'bad', 'side', 'effect', 'sperm', 'Godzilla', 'sized', 'monster', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'even', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'laughable', 'was', 'intention', 'film', 'trying', 'create', 'old', 'school', 'style', 'graphics', 'are', 'best', 'worst', 'can', 'expect.The', 'next', 'movie', 'WearBears', 'Where', 'kid', 'bitten', 'butt', 'wearbear', 'only', 'fight', 'off', 'not', 'want', 'become', 'part', 'homosexual-flesh', 'eating', 'gang', 'lot', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'only', 'set', 'beach', 'musical', 'numbers', 'included', 'Not', 'one', 'favorite', 'parts', 'film.Next', 'up', 'black', 'white', 'feature', 'where', 'Hitler', 'Dr', 'Frankenstein', 'book', 'create', 'own', 'Jewish', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'train', 'kill', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'features.Next', 'up', 'feature', 'feces', ""n't"", 'sound', 'much', ""n't"", 'run', 'very', 'long', 'was', 'part', 'movie', 'laughed', 'hardest', 'final', 'act', 'movie', 'small', 'twist', 'end', 'not', 'much', 'one', 'film', 'title', 'Zombies', 'drive', 'something', 'line.Overall', 'fans', 'Troma', 'will', 'enjoy', 'gory', 'comedy', 'likes', 'Kentucky', 'Fried', 'Movie', 'A', 'couple', 'different', 'features', 'thrown', 'one', 'Grindhouse', 'night', 'terror', 'well', 'more', 'likely', 'decent', 'flick', 'thought', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'enjoy', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'watch', 'now', 'definitely', 'become', 'new', 'favorite', 'mine', 'collection', 'like', 'gross', 'top', 'gory-camp', 'style', 'humor', 'then', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'think', 'something', 'Friends', 'greatest', 'show', 'then', 'yeah', 'will', 'hate', 'film.Bonus', 'coarse', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'out', 'few', 'things', 'movie', 'Did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'Kane', 'Hodder', 'Frankenstein', 'Monster-esq', 'creature', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'directors', 'producers', 'movie', 'made', 'Hatchet', 'Detroit', 'Rock', 'City', 'was', 'surprise', 'see', 'Kane', 'was', 'apart', 'Also', 'Kane', 'very', 'popular', 'Friday', '13th', 'fans', 'having', 'played', 'Jason', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'Also', 'commentary', 'nod', 'Lloyd', 'Kaufman', 'Troma', 'knew', 'had', 'be', 'fans', 'Wadzilla', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Seem', 'be', 'more', 'extended', 'scenes', 'then', 'anything.The', 'Making', 'Diary', 'Anne', 'Frankenstein', 'A', 'few', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'making', 'segment', 'Including', 'interviews', 'Kane', 'Hodder.I', 'was', 'Teenage', 'Wearbear', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailer', 'short', 'film.Zom-B-Movie', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes.A', 'couple', 'comic-con', 'interviews', '4', 'directors', 'couple', 'trailers', 'film', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'souley', 'DVD', 'bit', 'joke', 'where', 'just', 'meant', 'reveal', 'most', 'movie', 'trailers', 'old', 'fashioned', 'bonus', 'content', 'great', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'learn', 'more', 'film', 'loved', 'hated', 'then', 'why', 'did', 'even', 'wan', 'na', 'know', 'what', 'bonus', 'content', 'was']",N/A

It could almost pass as a sequel to either Grindhouse or Creepshow. The movie is told in 4 different segments. When the local drive-in theater is being closed down, the owner shows 4 classic horror movies for its final night.Wadzilla- This was my favorite of the bunch. The plot is so over-the-top and goofy and spoofs the monster genre from the 60's. When a man tries to get his sperm count raised, he takes a drug and creates a sperm monster that attacks New York.I Was A Teenage Werebear- My least favorite of the bunch. It's a musical spoof. A teenager in the 'closet' named Ricky has a desire for men. He is bitten by a Werebear and becomes one of them. The next time I watch this movie, I'm skipping it.The Diary of Anne Frankenstein- My 2nd favorite of the bunch. It spoofs Hitler and the Frankenstein story. The movie is in black and white and spoken in a gibberish language that substitutes for German. Kristina Klebe was hot and beautiful as Eva Braun. Joel David Moore was hilarious as Hitler. He invents a Jewish Frankenstein monster named Meshugannah that begins to attack the Nazis.Zom B Movie- This segment is shown during the intermission of the other movies.

1459672,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B005G02LC4,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[22, 25]","Personally I've grown quite weary of all these homage/throwback style grindhouse films that have been coming out over the last few years.  Every now and again a decent one comes through, but for me it's like watching a tribute band-It may be decent, but all it really makes you want to do is see the real band.Chillerama is another one of these of course, and it really wears it's influences on it's sleeve.  It's a full on comedy, and aimed solely at exploitation/horror junkies like myself.  Not that you have to be horror fanatic to appreciate this film, but you will definitely catch most of the references, homages and jokes if you are.  Just like you don't have to be a James Bond fan to enjoy the Austin Powers films, but it helps immensely.  The humor is mainly of the crude sexual variety-Definitely a What-Can-We-Get-Away-With approach.  Many reviewers compare this to Troma, and that's a fair comparison, though I'd say that Troma is still the undisputed king of pushing the limits of sex/violence and bad taste.Chillerama, in the Creepshow and Amicus Pictures tradition, is an anthology film(remember those?).  It's four stories by four newschool horror directors(though Adam Rifkin has been around for awhile now).  The film takes place in a drive-in theater on it's last night before it's torn down.  Three ""lost"" horror films are being shown, and we watch those three films with the audience.The first is WADZILLA by Adam Rifkin, and arguably the best one.  A nerdy guy takes an experimental drug to increase sperm volume and before you know it there's a gigantic sperm terrorizing New York.  This film takes place in the 50s and is an homage to the giant monsters on the rampage movies of that time.  However, the look and style of the film seems to be more in the vein of horror films from the 70s and early 80s.  A kind of two for one deal, and a very good homage on both counts.The second film is I WAS A TEENAGE WEREBEAR by Tim Sullivan.  This is story set in the early 60s about a guy who is struggling with the fact that he might be homosexual.  He's not so much interested in his girlfriend as he is in the local gang of leather clad bad boys.  When he's bitten by the James Dean-esque leader of the gang(the two sidekicks look like they stepped out of the Blue Oyster Bar from the Police Academy movies), he becomes a gay werewolf-A Werebear!!  He refuses to join the fold however.  Kind of a gay Lost Boys if you will.  This film is less an homage to horror as it is an homage to both teenage 50s films like Rebel Without A Cause and the Beach Party films of the 60s.  There are even a few musical numbers.This is the episode that gets the most heat from reviewers.  While I agree that it is the weakest link here, I don't share the animosity towards it.  It is actually a good homage to the genres it's spoofing, it's just that it probably doesn't belong in this movie as it's really the odd one out and throws off the momentum.Then there's Adam Green's DIARY OF ANNE FRANKENSTEIN.  This is about Hitler obtaining Anne Frank(enstein)'s grandfather's diary, which of course contains the secrets of creating life from the dead.  Hitler creates his own hulking brute to help him take over the world.  Green did a great job on this homage to films of the 30s.  It's all in ""German"" with English subtitles.  The ""German"" here is impressively and humorously improvised instead of being actual German.  The 30s look is fantastic, and the slapstick buffoonery of Hitler is like many of the American films and cartoons of that era that poked fun of him.  Great stuff.A fourth film called DEATHICATION is set to show, but is interrupted by the proper fourth film, ZOM-B-MOVIE, which is the wraparound story about a zombie invasion at the drive-in showing the CHILLERAMA.  We only see the first few minutes of DEATHICATION, but it's a hilarious collection of poop themed carnage.  Definitely the most TROMA-esque.In ZOM-B-MOVIE by Joe Lynch, all the drama we've been experiencing with the characters at the drive-in comes to a head when the zombie outbreak begins(the prologue shows how this infestation begins), and the characters find themselves fighting for their lives....and virginity.  The zombies aren't so much here to eat them(though they certainly do), but to.....you know what!It's a decent story, also quite TROMA-esque, but honestly I'm sick of zombies.  With zombies having become so commercialized and becoming the Star Trek of the horror genre in recent years(along with vampires), I don't care if I ever see another zombie movie again.  I'm so desensitized to it, zombies just don't do anything for me anymore(I never thought I'd ever say those words).So, while Chillerama may not be perfect on all accounts, I think horror fans will find quite a bit here to eat up and enjoy.  Plus it's really reassuring to see modern horror film directors keeping their love for classic horror and exploitation alive.  A great love letter to the drive-in era that we horror fans all love so much.  I'm glad this film was made and I'm glad to have watched it.",4,"Keepin' It Real, As You Crazy Kids Like To Say!",1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,5076,"['Personally', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'quite', 'weary',

1459676,A2FXKM19I0Y41S,B005G02LC4,walter ruether,"[2, 8]","As a lifelong Horror fan & the producer of two anthologies myself Im very happy to see they are making a comeback. The fact we have a new theatrical horror anthology coming out called Theater of bizarre & and a ton of Horror anthology DVD releases it saddens me that with all the talent in Chillerama it stinks, I think this really gives a good traditional anthology a bad name. Lets face it Great movies Like Creepshow & all the old Amicus anthologies (Tales from the crypt Ect..) can never be touched, What gets me about this film is its really the only new anthology you will find in every Walmart & retail outlet across the country its not just confined to online purchase & indie record stores & i think its a case of well it's got Adam Green & Tim Sullivan as directors so there is a lot of who you know power behind this film with that said here is why i find this film a travesty. First of all its not a fun movie unless you like Troma style toilet humor because thats all this film has to offer, There is a short about a Killer sperm which is the monster on the cover that looks like Aliens deadly spawn. Then we have a short about Gay Werewolves (why) I don't even remember the other short & thats because after the Werewolf segment I was already completely turned off by this film. The best part of this movie is the wrap around scenes. Basically the film takes place in a Drive in and the shorts are what is playing at this drive in. If you wanna see a Great fun & old fashion Horror anthology that just came out I would definitely recommend Midnight Releasings Drive-In Horrorshow A fun Traditional Horror film for all ages which is how it should be. I mean when did Gay werewolves & Killer sperm Wads become scary NEVER its just dumb, this is definitely a trashy Horror comedy that should of been released by Troma, I am mad because like i said this shouldn't be thee most popular new anthology. There are way better ones out there & just because they don't have the Hollywood Power forces of Green & Sullivan behind them doesn't mean they cant be way better then Chillerama is. If you wanna see a great anthology produced recently in the last 2 yrs may I suggest Slices of Life, Drive-In Horror show or another good Horror comedy Nightmare Alley I would avoid this at all costs its not worth it unless you think Killer sperm is cool.",1,Dont Waste your Money,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,2348,"['lifelong', 'Horror', 'fan', 'producer', 'two', 'anthologies', 'Im', 'very', 'happy', 'see', 'are', 'making', 'comeback', 'fact', 'have', 'new', 'theatrical', 'horror', 'anthology', 'coming', 'out', 'called', 'Theater', 'bizarre', 'ton', 'Horror', 'anthology', 'DVD', 'talent', 'Chillerama', 'think', 'really', 'good', 'traditional', 'anthology', 'bad', 'name', 'face', 'Great', 'movies', 'Creepshow', 'old', 'Amicus', 'anthologies', 'Tales', 'crypt', 'Ect..', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'touched', 'What', 'film', 'really', 'only', 'new', 'anthology', 'will', 'find', 'Walmart', 'retail', 'outlet', 'country', 'not', 'just', 'confined', 'online', 'purchase', 'indie', 'record', 'stores', 'i', 'think', 'case', 'well', 'got', 'Adam', 'Green', 'Tim', 'Sullivan', 'directors', 'lot', 'who', 'know', 'power', 'film', 'said', 'here', 'why', 'i', 'find', 'film', 'travesty', 'First', 'not', 'fun', 'movie', 'like', 'Troma', 'style', 'toilet', 'humor', 'film', 'offer', 'short', 'Killer', 'sperm', 'monster', 'cover', 'Aliens', 'deadly', 'spawn', 'Then', 'have', 'short', 'Gay', 'Werewolves', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'other', 'short', 'thats', 'Werewolf', 'segment', 'was', 'already', 'completely', 'turned', 'off', 'film', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'wrap', 'scenes', 'Basically', 'film', 'place', 'Drive', 'shorts', 'are', 'what', 'playing', 'drive', 'wan', 'see', 'Great', 'fun', 'old', 'fashion', 'Horror', 'anthology', 'just', 'came', 'out', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Midnight', 'Releasings', 'Drive-In', 'Horrorshow', 'A', 'fun', 'Traditional', 'Horror', 'film', 'ages', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'mean', 'when', 'did', 'Gay', 'werewolves', 'Killer', 'sperm', 'Wads', 'become', 'scary', 'NEVER', 'just', 'dumb', 'definitely', 'trashy', 'Horror', 'comedy', 'should', 'been', 'released', 'Troma', 'am', 'mad', 'i', 'said', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'thee', 'most', 'popular', 'new', 'anthology', 'are', 'way', 'better', 'ones', 'there', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Hollywood', 'Power', 'forces', 'Green', 'Sullivan', ""n't"", 'mean', 'cant', 'be', 'way', 'better', 'then', 'Chillerama', 'wan', 'see', 'great', 'anthology', 'produced', 'recently', 'last', '2', 'yrs', 'may', 'suggest', 'Slices', 'Life', 'Drive-In', 'Horror', 'show', 'good', 'Horror', 'comedy', 'Nightmare', 'Alley', 'would', 'avoid', 'costs', 'not', 'think', 'Killer', 'sperm', 'cool']",N/A
