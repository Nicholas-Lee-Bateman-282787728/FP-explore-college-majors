Gordon,"[2, 2]","Fascinating, well told and ultimately touching, this short (60 minute) biography of the legendary sharpshooter tellsthe tale of an amazing life, full of more than it's shares of ups and downs.Oakley was, without setting out to be, a pioneer among women, competing on even terms in a man's world, at a man'ssport, and beating men at their own game at a time when that was generally unthinkable, becoming an internationalstar in the process.At the same time, she stayed outwardly to the Victorian ideal of seeming demure and `lady-like'.  Yet she would fightferociously to protect herself, her position and her image.  A woman full of contradictions, a moving love story, a fight to breakthrough a disastrous childhood, and the story of an amazing talent make this a very entertaining piece of history.One lovely touch is there is actually some early movie footage of the real Oakley from appearances late in her career, a niceaddition to the usual talking heads and still photos.",4,"Entertaining, involving and worthwhile historical biography",1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,978,"['Fascinating', 'well', 'told', 'ultimately', 'touching', 'short', '60', 'minute', 'biography', 'legendary', 'sharpshooter', 'tellsthe', 'tale', 'amazing', 'life', 'full', 'more', 'shares', 'ups', 'downs.Oakley', 'was', 'setting', 'out', 'be', 'pioneer', 'women', 'competing', 'even', 'terms', 'man', 'world', ""man'ssport"", 'beating', 'men', 'own', 'game', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'generally', 'unthinkable', 'becoming', 'internationalstar', 'process.At', 'same', 'time', 'stayed', 'outwardly', 'Victorian', 'ideal', 'seeming', 'demure', 'lady-like', 'would', 'fightferociously', 'protect', 'position', 'image', 'woman', 'full', 'contradictions', 'moving', 'love', 'story', 'fight', 'breakthrough', 'disastrous', 'childhood', 'story', 'amazing', 'talent', 'make', 'very', 'entertaining', 'piece', 'history.One', 'lovely', 'touch', 'actually', 'early', 'movie', 'footage', 'real', 'Oakley', 'appearances', 'late', 'career', 'niceaddition', 'usual', 'talking', 'heads', 'still', 'photos']",American Experience - Annie Oakley
996881,A3AD071UEP20WS,B000FVQYUO,"Roger Long ""longrush""","[5, 5]","Annie Oakley's life has become much distorted by bad biographies, musical plays and movies as to be lost forever.  But here we have at least a sincere attempt to tell her story without romantic gimmicks and half-truths.  The real story of her life is far more interesting than the one invented by Hollywood or Broadway.Her early life was filled with poverty and pain, of feeding the Oakley family by hunting game, and shooting was the unlikely talent that lifted her above being forgotten.  The rather dainty and feminine Miss Oakley met and bested one of the champion shots of her day, they married, and she became world famous.  It sounds easy to put it that way, but it was anything but easy.  Starting in pre-vaudeville, they later traveled with Buffalo Bill's Wild West, were the toast of Europe, met Queen Victoria, the Kaiser, and other dignitaries.  Not bad for a girl born in a small Ohio town, a girl who had to be hired out to cruel employers because her mother could not feed her.It all sounds like some bizarre Horatio Alger story, of course, and it goes to prove that real biography can exceed the exaggerations of the dime novel.",5,Fine piece of work,1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,1144,"['Annie', 'Oakley', 'life', 'become', 'much', 'distorted', 'bad', 'biographies', 'musical', 'plays', 'movies', 'be', 'lost', 'forever', 'here', 'have', 'least', 'sincere', 'attempt', 'tell', 'story', 'romantic', 'gimmicks', 'half-truths', 'real', 'story', 'life', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'one', 'invented', 'Hollywood', 'Broadway.Her', 'early', 'life', 'was', 'filled', 'poverty', 'pain', 'feeding', 'Oakley', 'family', 'hunting', 'game', 'shooting', 'was', 'unlikely', 'talent', 'lifted', 'being', 'forgotten', 'rather', 'dainty', 'feminine', 'Miss', 'Oakley', 'met', 'bested', 'one', 'champion', 'shots', 'day', 'married', 'became', 'world', 'famous', 'easy', 'put', 'way', 'was', 'anything', 'easy', 'Starting', 'pre-vaudeville', 'later', 'traveled', 'Buffalo', 'Bill', 'Wild', 'West', 'were', 'toast', 'Europe', 'met', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'Kaiser', 'other', 'dignitaries', 'Not', 'bad', 'girl', 'born', 'small', 'Ohio', 'town', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'be', 'hired', 'out', 'cruel', 'employers', 'mother', 'could', 'not', 'feed', 'her.It', 'sounds', 'bizarre', 'Horatio', 'Alger', 'story', 'course', 'prove', 'real', 'biography', 'can', 'exceed', 'exaggerations', 'dime', 'novel']",American Experience - Annie Oakley
