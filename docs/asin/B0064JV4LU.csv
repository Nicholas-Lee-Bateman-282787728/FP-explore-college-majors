It's the best film experience - no, the best theater-going experience - I've had in well some time.  I saw it with a keyed-up audience of Francophiles who had clearly heard the buzz and wanted to be there to see what has been called a 'cultural phenomenon' in Europe as it first hits US shores.Believe the hype.  Nakache and Toledano have constructed their film as a M&ouml;bius Strip - starting near to the end in seat-gripping introduction as co-protagonists Driss (Omar Sy in a groundbreaking C&eacute;sar-winning performance) and Philippe (Franois Cluzet -Tell No One) race a Maserati Quattroporte through the streets of late-night Paris.  Earth, Wind and Fire's ""September"" never sounded so good.  The directors then take us back to the start to show us how the two met.The film perfectly mixes comedy and poignancy.  Sy - a gifted physical and verbal comedian - had our audience convulsed, at times, with laughter.  The subject matter - dealing with quadriplegia - doesn't seem ripe for comedy, but the film conveys both Philippe's desire not to be pitied and Driss' guileless honesty.  He simply treats Philippe as he would anyone else.  He's never been trained to do anything different.I extend this entreaty to all mainstream movie-goers: lay down your prejudices and aversions to subtitled movies and see this film.  Don't miss out.  I'm sure Hollywood will re-make this film...and kill it.  Please see this original version.  No one will pull your man card.

1509326,A391RY3TA1MCVM,B0064JV4LU,David Ljunggren,"[0, 0]","Les Intouchables relates the largely true story of how Philippe, a rich Parisian man who is paraplegic after a paragliding accident, hires Driss, an unemployed young man from a troubled suburb to be his assistant. In the film Driss is from Senegal; in real life he was Algerian. Driss, who only applied for the job so he can be eligible for benefit payment, is at first both bored and horrified by what he expected to do: feed, clean and drive around a man with no feeling below his neck. Driss shows no sympathy or pity for Philippe's handicap and pushes him to become more adventurous. For example, he ditches the boring van and starts driving around Paris in Philippe's Maserati, and presses his boss to set up a meeting with a woman penpal he's never seen. As the film progresses the two men develop a deepening friendhship. All the time though Driss is aware that his family - he is the eldest of several children of a single mother - is vulnerable and it becomes clear a younger brother is falling into the hands of a drugs ring. I don't want to give away the ending but the film doesn't pull its punches.

1509333,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0064JV4LU,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 5]","When filmmakers Olivier Nakache and &Eacute;ric Toledano discovered the documentary ""A la vie, a la mort"", they discovered a touching story about a wealthy quadriplegic French Aristocrat named Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caretaker, an ex-con named Abdel Sellou.A paragliding accident that left di Borgo, the former director of the Pommery champagne house and second son of a French duke having an ex-con as his caretaker was a story you you don't see often.  But it was because of Abdel being vain, arrogant and someone who didn't feel sorry for him.  Which in the dozens and dozens of people that were interviewed to be a caretaker, most felt sorry for him.  But for Abdel, he was full of humor and made di Borgo feel life and brought happiness to his life because he was unexpected.And so the story goes, as Nakache and Toledano crafted a screenplay after the documentary but also the experiences of di Borgo from his best selling book ""You Changed My Life"", they visited di Borgo to read their script and di Borgo helped bring realism to the script (while some fictional experiences were added for comedy).  But with Di Borgo's go ahead, the film was made and would star actor Francois Cluzet (""Tell No One"", ""Little White Lies"", ""French Kiss""), Omar Sy (""Micmacs"", ""Those Happy Days""), Ann Le Ny (""The Tste of Others"", ""Declaration of War"") and Audrey Fleurot (""Midnight in Paris"", ""Un Village Francais"").The film would receive international critical acclaim.  The film won ""Best Film"" and ""Best Actor"" for both Cluzet and Sy at the Tokyo International Film Festival, Best Actor at the Cesar Awards and the film became the third highest grossing film in France, the highest-grossing movie in a language other than English worldwide, surpassing the record set by the animated film ""Spirited Away"" and also becoming the top grossing foreign language film of 2012 in North America.  While the film would stay at #1 in German for nine consecutive weeks, Switzerland for eleven weeks and multiple weeks for many other countries.Suffice to say, the film was a financial box office success for Gaumont and in the U.S., the film's rights for an American remake were purchased by the Weinstein Co.  And now this award winning film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in March 2013 courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.VIDEO:""The Intouchables"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  The film looks fantastic as skin tone are natural, black levels are nice and deep.  Closeups show amazing detail,  the film is colorful sharp and if anything, because of the multiple locations of where this film was shot, the cinematography by Mathieu Vadepieed (""Read My Lips"", ""In Your Hands"") was beautifully shot.  I detected no aliasing or artifacts during my viewing of this film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Intouchables"" is presented in French 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The dialogue for the film is crystal clear and while the film is dialogue driven, also good use of music with a wonderful score by Ludovico Einaudi (""This is England"", ""Insidious"", ""Aprile"") and Earth, Wind and Fire coming clearly in lossles.  There are scenes with ambiance of crowds or car engine revving but for the most part, the lossless soundtrack is appropriate for this film.Subtitles are in English, English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Intouchables"" come with the following special features:Deleted Scenes - (5:35) Featuring five deleted scenesEXTRAS:""The Intouchables"" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows for one to download their film to a computer or on select Apple and Android devices and to stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.JUDGMENT CALL:Quite often you hear about a hype of a film, you wonder if its warranted.  It's one thing to hear a lot of hype when it comes from America but when a film begins to make an impact in several countries and stays at #1 for consecutive weeks, you know that the film must be special.And after watching ""The Intouchables"", I have to agree, this film is magnificent!Everything works so well with the film, from its writing, the humor, the outstanding performances by Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy but it's a storyline that you just never see too often. When it comes to films about paraplegic, the truth is that many films are about perseverance and having compassion for that person who was left injured and trying to manage life.But ""The Intouchables"" doesn't do that.  This is about an ex-convict who went into a job not for the sake of getting it, but for the sake of getting a rejection, having his paper signed in order to receive unemployment benefits.But it's the story of how a person, no matter how different they are, coming to a person's life at a time when they desperately need it.The character of Driss is in need of a job, a place to stay after getting kicked out of his apartment by his aunt, but what begins as a business relationship between caretaker and client, it became a relationship of friends in which Driss never treated Philippe with pity, he treated him like a normal guy, not afraid to crack jokes about staff or people, or even if he's in a wheelchair.The real Philippe that the film is based on said it perfectly in his interview with the UK Telegraph news publication about how important his caretaker was for him.  Philippe said, ""He treated me like I needed to be treated in the tough times ahead, partly because of my condition but also because my wife was dying of cancer [she died three years after his accident]. I needed to be back on track. Pity is the last thing you need. Pity is hopeless. Pity is what someone gives you because he is afraid to take care of you. I didn't need that. But compassion I don't need also. It comes from Latin and means `suffering with'. I don't want you to be suffering with me. I need consolation, which in Latin means keeping me as a whole person, respecting me as I am.""The film is magnificent for the fact that it's an unlikely pairing, but its the growing relationship of these two men of how one is able to bring this man out of the darkness and enjoy life once again.One scene has Driss jogging while Philippe is trying to catch up with his wheelchair.  Not so thrilled that the wheelchair is slow, they modify it to make it go much faster.Another scene featured Philippe wanting to get away and take part in skydiving and Driss of course, is not interested but eventually for the sake of Philippe, he does it anyway.There are so many of these random moments of kindness that you don't expect from Driss, even tricking Philippe into smoking a joint or hiring beautiful Asian masseuses to work on him and his ears (which give him pleasure).This is a feel-good movie with a lot of charm and a lot of soul and it's a film that leaves you feeling happy and appreciative that you saw a film so enjoyable.  Sure, ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""The King's Speech"" or ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" and perhaps other films may come to mind, as this style of movie has been done before.  Sure, the film could have been more melodramatic, more serious but it wasn't.  It's a film that manages not to be too sad but has its interjection of humor and with the two wonderful performances by both Cluzet and Sy,  you can't help but feel captivated with what you saw.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is fantastic, colorful and well-detailed and lossless audio was also crystal clear when it came to dialogue and music.  I did wish there were more special features included for a film that has received so much attention internationally.  Only five deleted scenes, no audio commentary, no featurettes, nothing.  So, if there was any low-point for this Blu-ray release, it's the lack of special features.I know that a few may find the film a bit repulsive that a caretaker would make fun of his paraplegic client in a certain manner, some that did not happen to the real Philippe but were featured in the film for comedy-sake, but through interviews I have read about Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caretaker, Abdel Sellou... this is what di Borgo needed, a caretaker who didn't treat him with pity or compassion, but on equal ground.  And that is why those two had that bond!While an American remake of ""The Intouchables"" is being planned, ""The Intouchables"" worked as a French film, as an American film, then things get a bit murky as people will question racial stereotypes, offensive treatment towards paraplegics and that it would have a negative impact for those in that industry.""The Intouchables"" is not about race, not about disability, yes...one man in Black, one man is not.  One is disabled, the other is not.  One man is wealthy, the other is not.  Critic reviews from Europe differ from America as the race/stereotype issue is brought up here in the U.S.  But this is a film not about racial hatred or a film about poking fun on a severe disability, it's a movie about hope and no matter how these two individuals were raised, it's how they are when they were together and the fact that as in real life and as in the film, this caretaker was able to bring Philippe, something that he thought he had lost... happiness.""The Intouchables"" is recommended!",5,"(4.5 stars) ""The Intouchables"" is a French cinema that is optimistic and  full of hope.

1509344,AJWDOCM9BLAQ3,B0064JV4LU,Fernando,"[9, 15]","Once in a while a movie comes along... that makes me feel blind.This beautifully shot movie is not without great acting and charm. Driss (Omar Sy) is pure charisma and Philippe (Francois Cluzet)'s performance is, while too understated, nuanced. Some scenes were really well-done. I'll look for other films with these amazing actors.Beyond this, however, I just can't see what others see in this movie. It is a heart-warming story, sorta, but so many movies have been here before; this is the Bucket List and the Odd Couple mixed in with five made-for-TV movies about a challenged person who needs a bit of sass in their life, provided by an uncouth companion. Driss' bullies his way through the movie and everyone just finds it endearing.  There he is assaulting the neighbor. There he is manhandling and humiliating the boss' daughter's boyfriend. Why? Well, because. Oh, Driss. Is he pouring hot water on Philippe's legs because he can't feel a thing? It's OK because it's amusing to him. By the way, is Philippe's daughter acting like a brat and doing drugs? No problem, Driss is offering to smack her a few times, and well, Philippe won't mind, she has it coming. And the caring nice guy nurse who takes over after Driss? Oh, no patience for that caring jerk. I seriously felt at the end that every character in the Philippe household, especially Philippe, was a secret submissive  masochist.Oh wait: besides his pizazz and lack of education, he turned out to be a really good painter. You know, because he worked at it for a week or two. So there, give him $30K for the doodle fancy artsy people like; he deserves it because... because he is Driss, get it? And the movie goes on like this! It is so outrageous that it's almost objectifying to the character. Why is everyone so happy and willing to play second fiddle to a thug? Try as he might the man just can do no wrong.Here's the compelling point: there was nothing during the initial interview that justified to the viewer that Driss should have gotten the job and if he had turned out to be a psychotic killer who stole (well, he actually did that too), raped and murdered a few in the household nobody would/should have been surprised.(SPOILER AHEAD) To add insult, there is some Hollywood kitsch here as well. Oh, Driss you charmy womanizer, so you like Philippe's secretary? Well she'll flirt with you through the whole movie but guess what: she's a lesbian! How do you like THAT? But wait, she'll hint that she might be into something kinky after all (wink-wink!)... This tripe is so unoriginal and trite is hardly worth commenting on. But this is what passes for funny in this movie.I find it very surprising this has been such a smash hit, especially in Europe where so many sophisticated yet watchable gems have been released in the last several years. Even here, most of the negative reviews complain about the movie being in French or an unplayable DVD, nothing about the lack of substance of this film. This is the most over-rated and over-hyped movie since Slum Dog Millionaire; it is as simplistic (more so actually) and just as contrived.Am I blind to the genius of this movie?

But if you are reading this before watching the movie, I hope this will be a good thing!  Anyway, I did not find anything racist about this film at all.  I lived in Paris for two years.  It is, like most large cosmopolitan cities, a cross-configuration of many cultures.  Yes, you have the iconic glamour of the boulevards, the Seine and the monuments, and you also have large neighborhoods made up of struggling immigrant populations. There is wealth and status and there is poverty and crime.  In this film, you see a character from each of these worlds cross paths, and the events and the emotions that ensue are a joy to behold and to experience.  Okay, so the wealthy guy is white, and the black guy is poor.  It's not meant to be a stereotype.  Francois Cluzet's character is from the aristocracy and Omar Sy's character is an immigrant.  And when you watch the film, ask yourself which one you would rather be.  Ask yourself which one is happier, or more fortunate.  So let's move on.  At first glance, it seems that this is going to be a heavy film, but what makes it work is the humor. There is a warmly comic element throughout. In several parts I laughed out loud, loudly.  And there are more than a few surprises to keep you on your toes.  The ending is superb; you wonder where it is going and where it goes is just fine.  There's even a nagging little loose end that is tied up in the final scene that is nicely symbolic of the transformation that has taken place within the character played by Omar Sy.  God, what an infectious laugh, smile and genuine affability he has!  Francois Cluzet is an immensely talented, seasoned actor.  Few actors come to mind whose emotions seem absolutely real rather than acted.  On a final note, I have seen many reviews where the viewer wishes that the film were dubbed.  I would respectfully urge you to watch the film with subtitles even if you are hesitant.  It is impossible to get the true feel of the characters' personalities otherwise. Watch the movie twice if you have to in order to get it all.  I wouldn't mind watching it again myself.  All and all a wonderful film.

1509355,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0064JV4LU,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","Films such as THE INTOUCHABLES come around far too seldom and when they do the public should somehow be advised that here is a cup of magic that could alter the manner in which we relate to each other and to the world tainted by schisms of societal errors. Written and directed by Olivier Nakache and &Eacute;ric Toledano the film was inspired by the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caregiver Abdel Sellou, discovered by the directors in `A la vie, &agrave; la mort', a documentary film. Of note, the book version of the film's story was written and released after the film enjoyed great success. Written by Abdel Sellou the book  `You Saved My Life' tells the extraordinary true story of the charming Algerian con-man' friendship with a disabled French aristocrat. Sellou's book shows the real man behind Sellou/Driss's smiling face. The book takes us from his childhood spent stealing candy from the local grocery store, to his career as a pickpocket and scam artist, to his unexpected employment as a companion for a quadriplegic. Sellou has never before divulged the details of his past.  In many interviews and documentaries, he has evaded or shrugged off the question of his childhood and his stay in prison, until now. He tells his story with a stunning amount of talent, with humor, style, and--though he denies that he has any--humility. Abdel Sellou now lives in Algeria with his wife and three children, where he runs a chicken farm. He remains close to Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, who lives in Morocco with his second wife and two children.The cinematic version of this relationship is an irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility. After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident the aristocratic intellectual Parisian millionaire Philippe (Franois Cluzet) is interviewing candidates for the position of his caretaker with his secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot). Out of the blue, the rude ex-con African Driss (Omar Sy) cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Philippe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance. Philippe, impressed that Driss is the only candidate who does not look at him with pity, challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Philippe and his employees, especially under the watchful and compassionate eye of the head of the house staff Yvonne (Anne Le Ny). As Driss reluctantly learns to move, feed, and clean Philippe, the two men discover a blunt but vital humor that not only bridges the cultural and class divide between them, but gives Philippe a renewed joy in life - and a chance to turn his passionate epistolary relationship with one Eleanore whom he has never seen into a chance at a second go at life.The only aspect of this film that is somewhat distracting is that the film opens with a car adventure involving both Philippe and Dris which is terrific film making and very funny but does make the film's beginning (after the credits) seem less surprising.  A very minor point, especially when the film ends with the same activity but this time drives it to an incredibly touching completion.  Highly recommended on every level: both Franois Cluzet  and Omar Sy are brilliant!

This heartwarming R-rated comedy is based on a book which tells the true story of two wildly different men who find a common ground and build an enduring friendship based on mutual respect. It was clear from the very beginning that the audience was invested in the story and I loved hearing gales of laughter throughout the theater from beginning to end. Audiences at the 2012 Seattle International Film Festival voted this the ""Most Liked"" selection.In this award-winning film from France (English captions), a wealthy aristocrat is paralyzed from a para-gliding accident and has hired many health-care worker/nurses who find caring for a wealthy quadriplegic too intimidating. A chronically unemployed immigrant from Senegal goes for an interview simply to get his application signed so he can continue his public assistance. He tends to be a little rude and doesn't show much respect or pity for the patient, who finds his lack of pity refreshing. The rest, as they say, is history.We enjoy:* Franois Cluzet (""Tell No One"") is the aristocrat. His new nurse/attendant is like a splash of cold water right smack in the face (which is the only part of his body with any sensation)!* Omar Sy (""Micmacs"") is the irrepressible nurse who starts out by stealing a Faberg&eacute; egg, so he isn't exactly a saint. His incredulity at his first opera is infectious and we all laughed along with our two heroes. And you've gotta see this guy dance!* Anne Le Ny (""Declaration of War"") is charming as the woman who runs the house, the staff, and knows everything. Her slow but steady thaw is so gratifying.* Audrey Fleurot (""Midnight in Paris"") has two of the funniest scenes with the nurse, and you don't expect it either time.As a wrap-up, they include a couple of clips of the real fellows who were depicted in this film. That is very nice. Once again I have proven I am not an artiste.

He is told to come back the next day, and is hired on the spot to become the caregiver for Philippe, a wheelchair-bound wealthy paraplegic. All we know about Driss is that he has recently been released from jail after doing 6 months for theft and has been kicked out of his family home. He has no prior caregiver experience, but he is young and strong and does not treat Philippe like a pitiable invalid.Driss soon learns all of the daily tasks that he needs to perform to bathe, groom and feed Philippe and there are many humorous moments along the way. He never treats Philippe roughly, nor does he treat him like a frail old man. He makes mistakes, he curses unabashedly and he has a sense of wonder and awe at the rich, privileged world he has been plopped into. One day, when preparing to take Philippe for an outing, he refuses to take the wheelchair-accessible minivan and insists on driving the powerful, sleek Maserati instead. Philippe enjoys watching Driss' boyish excitement at piloting such a macho car, and they enjoy many rides together.Philippe also has a cadre of other assistants, including a secretary, house manager, business manager and gardener. Initially they all are very skeptical about the loud, crude, big black man that has moved in; however his boyish charm and enthusiasm soon weave their magic on them, and they learn to accept him. He adds so much life and humor to what had been a sad, quiet place. He teaches Philippe to find humor in his situation and even to laugh at himself from time to time. The backstory of both characters is revealed through many outings, adventures and conversations.Without revealing any more of the plot, I will just conclude that this is a joyful love story on many levels. The unlikely pairing of a rich, white, cultured handicapped man and a poor, uneducated and uncouth black man creates a unique relationship that benefits both men. ""Intouchables"" is based on a true story; otherwise you would not believe that such a rare relationship could develop and thrive.

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[2, 2]","When I searched through Amazon's ""foreign language"" films to find something in French for my French students to experience, I found ""The Intouchables"" and decided to buy and try it, even though it contains strong language (lots of it), some drug use, and a mild hooker scene. Despite the negatives, students loved the film! As did I! (Note: The film is a French movie, but subtitles render it easy to follow.)It's a life-affirming story of people and activities. The African immigrant (as a young child) who is hired to be the personal assistant to Phillipe, a quadriplegic, totally dependent on others for his upkeep and even his life, is so winsome that it is almost impossible not to love this character. Driss comes to the interview to get a signature for unemployment, but, instead, is hired because he does not feel pity for the Frenchman or his circumstances. Driss even tells Phillipe in one scene that he won't give him some candy out of his bag. Why? ""No handy, no candy."" It is meant to be funny and it is. Driss badgers Phillipe into laughing at his own handicap.The only thing that can carry off this blatant humor is the actor himself, Omar Sy, who won the French equivalent of the Academy Award for Best Actor. In his humility, he told one reporter that both should have received the award. ""How can an award be split between two people when it took both people to make the story,"" he asked.There are so many wonderfully funny, poignant, and dramatic scenes throughout the movie. One of my faves is the scene in which he learns how large his bathroom is and that he has his own great big tub. He promptly seeks out Phillipe's secretary for whom Driss has a major attraction and asks her if she would like to take a bath with him. He is so serious. She is so rejecting.The ending is a great, warm delight. The range of emotions that passes over Phillipe's face (Francois Cluzet) is miraculous. ""The Intouchables"" is truly one of the great films. The fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more powerful.

So many reviewers have done an excellent job describing why THE INTOUCHABLES is such a great movie, it's very little for me to add.  I can only repeat that this movie is superb because the director was able to balance comedy with drama; using characters who were so different ethnically, culturally, socially, and from extremely different economic classes, it was a pleasure watching how the two interacted and broached their 'class' differences.Also, I thought it was especially poignant that Philippe's desire to enjoy his life, despite his sever handicap, helped viewers better understand why individuals with such handicaps make the choices they do.  I've seen awesome courage among severely handicapped individuals; some of whom participate in 'Special Olympics', and some whose stories are told in inspirational documentaries.  And, in The Intouchables, we get to appreciate how Phillippe and his caretaker, Driss are able to build an unlikely  relationship.  Indeed, Phillipe concedes that his money allows him to enjoy a limited quality of life, because of his will to live.Conversely, there are many other severely handicapped individuals who lack the will or desire to live with their irreversible conditions.  This begs the question if we as individuals have the right to 'choose' death with dignity when suffering sever handicaps.  This was the moral quandary in the case of the Spanish quadriplegic, Ramon Sampedro whose story was adapted to film.  The movie, THE SEA INSIDE [2004] starred Javier Bardem as Ramon Sampedro, a quadriplegic not unlike the wealthy Phillippe in The Intouchables, who was completely dependent on caretakers.  Yet, unlike our 'hero' Phillippe, Ramon Sampedro was just as impassioned. But here the similarities end. Sampedro would fight the Spanish government for almost 30 years for his right - not to live- but the right to an assistant suicide/euthanasia.Not sure about anyone else, but I would have to applaud the character, Phillippe for his courage and zest or life despite the severity of his handicap.  Yet, I also feel compassion for Sampedro. Therefore, I'd  avoid passing moral judgment on Ramon Sampedro for the choice and battle he fought for his right to ownership of dignity in death.Undoubtedly, The Intouchables was probably the best French movie I've seen in decades.Maizie Lucille JamesJune 29, 2014",5,GREATEST MODERN-DAY FRENCH MOVIE WHICH I WILL WATCH MANY TIMES,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,2363,"['Wow', 'So', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'describing', 'why', 'INTOUCHABLES', 'such', 'great', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'add', 'can', 'only', 'repeat', 'movie', 'superb', 'director', 'was', 'able', 'balance', 'comedy', 'drama', 'using', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'so', 'different', 'ethnically', 'culturally', 'socially', 'extremely', 'different', 'economic', 'classes', 'was', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'how', 'two', 'interacted', 'broached', ""'class"", 'differences.Also', 'thought', 'was', 'especially', 'poignant', 'Philippe', 'desire', 'enjoy', 'life', 'sever', 'handicap', 'helped', 'viewers', 'better', 'understand', 'why', 'individuals', 'such', 'handicaps', 'make', 'choices', 'do', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'awesome', 'courage', 'severely', 'handicapped', 'individuals', 'whom', 'participate', ""'Special"", 'Olympics', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'inspirational', 'documentaries', 'Intouchables', 'get', 'appreciate', 'how', 'Phillippe', 'caretaker', 'Driss', 'are', 'able', 'build', 'unlikely', 'relationship', 'Indeed', 'Phillipe', 'money', 'enjoy', 'limited', 'quality', 'life', 'will', 'live.Conversely', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'severely', 'handicapped', 'individuals', 'who', 'lack', 'will', 'desire', 'live', 'irreversible', 'conditions', 'question', 'as', 'individuals', 'have', 'right', ""'choose"", 'death', 'dignity', 'when', 'suffering', 'sever', 'handicaps', 'was', 'moral', 'quandary', 'case', 'Spanish', 'quadriplegic', 'Ramon', 'Sampedro', 'story', 'was', 'adapted', 'film', 'movie', 'THE', 'SEA', 'INSIDE', '[', '2004', ']', 'starred', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Ramon', 'Sampedro', 'quadriplegic', 'not', 'wealthy', 'Phillippe', 'Intouchables', 'who', 'was', 'completely', 'dependent', 'caretakers', ""'hero"", 'Phillippe', 'Ramon', 'Sampedro', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'impassioned', 'here', 'similarities', 'end', 'Sampedro', 'would', 'fight', 'Spanish', 'government', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'right', 'not', 'live-', 'right', 'assistant', 'suicide/euthanasia.Not', 'sure', 'anyone', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'applaud', 'character', 'Phillippe', 'courage', 'zest', 'life', 'severity', 'handicap', 'also', 'feel', 'compassion', 'Sampedro', 'Therefore', ""'d"", 'avoid', 'passing', 'moral', 'judgment', 'Ramon', 'Sampedro', 'choice', 'battle', 'fought', 'right', 'ownership', 'dignity', 'death.Undoubtedly', 'Intouchables', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'French', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'decades.Maizie', 'Lucille', 'JamesJune', '29', '2014']",N/A

From the rich invalid who accepts his limitations and even unnecessarily imposing more of the same on himself, he has settled into even the most vicarious of relationships, an epistolary one with a woman unseen.Along comes Driss, so full of convictions: he is unemployable, will not put on another's support stockings, all attractive women find him irresistible, hang gliding is insane and certainly would not consider taking care of an invalid's most personal, basic needs.All of this understandable. We get into life's routines which are most comfortable and focus on directing our activities to emphasize them. Then life throws people into circumstances which break down those barriers, some of the strongest with surprising ease. The foundation of the relationship between the two characters is established and once the trust is established, they proceed to explore what other limitations can and need to be eliminated. Laughter begins to fill the mansion, sacred bonds are examined like Phillipe's relationship with his adopted daughter.Life begins anew for both. Little things are symbolic like stuffy opera and classical music contrasted with dancing to Earth, Wind and Fire at a birthday party. Driss is fearless in all aspects of life until he encounters hang gliding. Having singularly described himself as 'pragmatic' in an interview, accepting some semi parachute float him far from where his feet are firmly on the ground is forbidden territory. With Nina Simone helping out, his fears turn to exhilaration as expressed by ""I'm having a blast"".We would not expect a stuffy, rich invalid to smoke dope and find it opens new perspectives, yet it does physically and spiritually as now he can truly breathe and laugh.But then the compromise Driss makes to work to the point where this had become a new 'principle' is shattered by his family life. Always a priority for him, his family has had been sacrificed in order to fulfill these obligations, but in the end so as to take care of them it is recognized and accepted he has to be with them.In route, Driss finds out why the hot red head he has been pining for has resisted his most earnest affections. Phillipe has to give up Driss and again compromise by accepting a inadequate substitute caregiver, as useless and inane as the resumes of the rest.The invalid finally meets his literary companion to close out that limiting aspect of his life - due to no small effort by Driss who by now does not work for him but is driven to see the relationship have a chance.As we relive replaying the car ride from the beginning, there is an underlying uneasiness about its purpose and how it will end. Again we are reminded: this story is about living life and leaving the alternatives behind. That will not be compromised.Enjoyable movie that forces the viewer to suspend credulity but discard disbelief because in the end it works. The movie requires faith up until the point where we want this relationship to work and in the end our faith in the human spirit is renewed.",5,Delightful French movie,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,3181,"[""'Intouchabes"", 'moving', 'story', 'characters', 'walks', 'who', 'perceive', 'life', 'certain', 'ways', 'convincing', 'believing', 'are', 'principles', 'rich', 'invalid', 'who', 'limitations', 'even', 'unnecessarily', 'imposing', 'more', 'same', 'settled', 'even', 'most', 'vicarious', 'relationships', 'epistolary', 'one', 'woman', 'unseen.Along', 'Driss', 'full', 'convictions', 'unemployable', 'will', 'not', 'put', 'support', 'stockings', 'attractive', 'women', 'find', 'irresistible', 'hang', 'gliding', 'insane', 'certainly', 'would', 'not', 'consider', 'taking', 'care', 'invalid', 'most', 'personal', 'basic', 'needs.All', 'understandable', 'get', 'life', 'routines', 'are', 'most', 'comfortable', 'focus', 'directing', 'activities', 'emphasize', 'Then', 'life', 'people', 'circumstances', 'break', 'down', 'barriers', 'strongest', 'surprising', 'ease', 'foundation', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters', 'established', 'once', 'trust', 'established', 'proceed', 'explore', 'what', 'other', 'limitations', 'can', 'need', 'be', 'eliminated', 'Laughter', 'fill', 'mansion', 'sacred', 'bonds', 'are', 'examined', 'Phillipe', 'relationship', 'adopted', 'daughter.Life', 'anew', 'Little', 'things', 'are', 'symbolic', 'stuffy', 'opera', 'classical', 'music', 'contrasted', 'dancing', 'Earth', 'Wind', 'Fire', 'birthday', 'party', 'Driss', 'fearless', 'aspects', 'life', 'hang', 'gliding', 'Having', 'singularly', 'described', ""'pragmatic"", 'interview', 'accepting', 'semi', 'parachute', 'float', 'far', 'where', 'feet', 'are', 'firmly', 'ground', 'forbidden', 'territory', 'Nina', 'Simone', 'helping', 'out', 'fears', 'turn', 'exhilaration', 'expressed', ""'m"", 'having', 'blast', 'would', 'not', 'expect', 'stuffy', 'rich', 'invalid', 'smoke', 'dope', 'find', 'new', 'perspectives', 'physically', 'spiritually', 'as', 'now', 'can', 'truly', 'breathe', 'laugh.But', 'then', 'compromise', 'Driss', 'work', 'point', 'where', 'had', 'become', 'new', ""'principle"", 'shattered', 'family', 'life', 'priority', 'family', 'had', 'been', 'sacrificed', 'order', 'fulfill', 'obligations', 'end', 'so', 'take', 'care', 'recognized', 'accepted', 'be', 'them.In', 'route', 'Driss', 'out', 'why', 'hot', 'red', 'head', 'been', 'pining', 'resisted', 'most', 'earnest', 'affections', 'Phillipe', 'give', 'up', 'Driss', 'again', 'compromise', 'accepting', 'inadequate', 'substitute', 'caregiver', 'useless', 'inane', 'resumes', 'rest.The', 'invalid', 'finally', 'literary', 'companion', 'close', 'out', 'limiting', 'aspect', 'life', 'due', 'small', 'effort', 'Driss', 'who', 'now', 'not', 'work', 'driven', 'see', 'relationship', 'have', 'chance.As', 'relive', 'replaying', 'car', 'ride', 'beginning', 'underlying', 'uneasiness', 'purpose', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'are', 'reminded', 'story', 'living', 'life', 'leaving', 'alternatives', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'compromised.Enjoyable', 'movie', 'viewer', 'suspend', 'credulity', 'discard', 'disbelief', 'end', 'movie', 'faith', 'up', 'point', 'where', 'want', 'relationship', 'work', 'end', 'faith', 'human', 'spirit', 'renewed']",N/A

1509419,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0064JV4LU,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","I'm always pleased when I come across something that surprises me and makes me smile out of the blue. The only sad part about the movie I'm writing about this week is that it's a French film. Why is that sad? Because there are far too many people in this world who won't take the chance, won't take the time and won't pay attention to what they're watching enough to see this film. Once they learn they'll have to read subtitles they'll pass it by. The sad thing is in doing so they'll miss one of the best movies of this past year. So take a chance, please.THE INTOUCHABLES is the story of Driss (Omar Sy), a young black man recently released from jail and living in the low income housing area of Paris. The story opens with Driss seemingly applying for a job taking care of a wealthy quadriplegic man named Phillipe (Francois Cluzet). Phillipe is bored with each applicant and known for being a task master. When Driss comes in just asking them to sign his welfare papers so he can collect, Phillipe tells him to come back the next day.Driss returns home to have his mother ask him to leave because of his past. With several brothers and sisters, he does so in the hopes of helping them. The next morning he returns to Phillipe's home and is told he's being hired temporarily to see if he works out. Most of the staff doesn't think he'll make it. But Phillipe see's something in him that the rest don't. More than that he knows Driss will offer him more honesty and straight forwardness than the rest of the staff.Driss is amazed at his living conditions first. It's the first time he's had a room of his own let alone a custom bathroom for his own use. As Driss goes about his first day, he does indeed offer no ounce of sympathy for Phillipe and talks to him like any other person he would me. Phillipe finds this incredibly refreshing and actually finds something to smile about in the presence of Driss. Driss begins to learn Phillipe's daily routine and how things work around the house.As the days go by the pair become not only employer and employee but friends as well. Both try to educate the other about the differences that they have. Where Phillipe attempts to expose Driss to opera and classical music, Driss tunes Phillipe into groups like Earth Wind & Fire. They come from different worlds but they find enjoyment in each other's company.One of the tasks that Phillipe does each week is to write a letter to a lady pen pal he's been wooing for the past 6 months. Filled with expressions of romance Driss can't believe he's not tried to meet her and sets about doing so by calling her and then passing the phone to Phillipe. A meeting is scheduled but no one knows for sure what will happen.The same is true of Driss' past catching up to him. Concerned about his family and the chance that his brother may turn up like him he keeps an eye on them from the sidelines and eventually must make a decision just who needs help more, his brother or Phillipe.Through it all the Driss and Phillipe share small adventures that show both have a sense of wonder still and a love of life. Though confined to his wheelchair and unable to move anything but his head and neck, Phillipe learns to smile and laugh again.There is a certain joy about this film that rubs off after viewing it. You'll find yourself literally laughing out loud at moments. I know I did. Best of all will be the life affirming knowledge that the film was based on a true story. What became of the pair is revealed just before the credits.Acting is something that transcends language. The facial expressions and moves of an actor in film show that it is a visual art form rather than just the sounds made vocally. Yes, the things they say in this film will make you laugh but coupled with the actions both actors offer great performances here.Nominated around the world for awards it's sad that it wasn't nominated for best foreign picture at this year's Academy Awards. It should have won hands down. So don't be afraid to try something different. Don't let the fact that this film is French scare you away. Take a moment and enjoy the story and laugh at all it has to offer.

I knew I was not going to be disappointed. There are quite a few priceless scenes and without spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen it, the Maserati scene really conveys the spirit of the interaction between Driss and Philippe right off the bat. Driss' charismatic personality and Philippe's facial reactions and dry comments to some of the outlandish things Driss does throughout this film are so entertaining.  Another one of my favorite scenes is when Driss dances.  Anyone who can't get up and move to Earth, Wind & Fire's Boogie Wonderland would have to be in Philippe's condition and you can see how he longingly looks at Driss and wishes he could participate too! Driss moves like liquid across the dance floor so effortlessly and I loved how his charisma and talent affects the other members of Philippe's staff to get up and begin dancing egged on by Driss to celebrate the party.I felt Cluzet, who played Philippe, did an excellent job portraying a quadriplegic which is not an easy task as he had to rely solely on his facial emotions/comments to carry each scene which he does effortlessly. I could not get over his resemblance to Dustin Hoffman in a couple of scenes.  I loved the interaction between the two men and some of the other staff members as well, in particular Magalie, the red-head, who Driss has the hots for. The movie does not disappoint when it is revealed later Magalie's choice in partners to Driss' surprise after his endless pursuit of her.The score of the film was done by one of my favorite musicians and composer, Italian Ludovico Einaudi, who is an absolute genius.  His minimal style was exactly what was needed in the background so as not to detract from what was going on in the film itself.All in all, this is a movie not to miss.

From what is a remarkable, mesmerizing and poignant tribute to the power of authentic human connection over the paralysis of fear, lovelessness and ennui, Variety and The New York Times among others, choose to see this truth-based relationship between an aristocratic French quadriplegic and his street-tough black caregiver as a red, white and blue meme to the continuing plague of racial stereotyping and class-based exploitation.As Jerry Lewis has learned the hard way over decades, America ain't France and I would therefore most humbly suggest to the lions of professional judgment that they view the film without the baggage and institutionalized biases that overwhelm their own criticisms of it. What the critics-for-hire anticipated was the stillborn, racial clownishness of Eddie Murphy and Judge Reinhold in Beverly Hills Cop - what the film delivered was something real and touching that they couldn't explain, so they forced their original narrative anyway.I am the first one to roll may eyes at any film that is overwrought by any political or ham handed social agenda - thankfully, this screenwriter borne virus is not an issue with this film.The Intouchables is the rare film where you know from the first five minutes that you are watching something special. The subtitles melt quickly into the background as the real-world relationship between billionaire Philippe and reluctant caregiver Driss is propelled by the bravura performances of actors Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy.

Oleson,"[0, 0]","A global crowd pleaser to be sure, this based-on-real-events story avoids the clutches of emotional manipulation which would have been its downfall.  Instead, the two primary characters mesh their cultural differences into an upbeat story of life and its challenges.Phillippe (Francois Cluzet) is a wealthy quadriplegic, injured in a hang gliding accident.  He and his attractive secretary (Audrey Fleurot) are interviewing men who will aid Phillippe with dressing, bathing and other hygiene concerns.  Among the interviewees is Driss (Omar Sy) who immigrated to France from Senegal as a boy.  Driss has grown up on the streets and is a small time hoodlum whose mother has kicked him out of their crowded apartment.Driss has no intention of getting the job, but needs a signature saying he was there so that he can get his unemployment check.  Surprisingly, Phillippe likes the guy's smart ass attitude and he's hired.  At this point, there is no question where this will head but the journey is a good one.Phillippe gets a renewed sense of adventure as Driss drives his boss's Maserati dangerously through the Parisian streets.  And then Driss sets Phillippe up on a date with an unseen correspondent.  Driss is introduced to the fine arts of classical music, opera and painting.  As their worlds collide they are also expanded in different directions.  Written and directed by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, the film is beautifully photographed and acted with joy and warmth.  An excellent supporting cast headed by Anne Le Ny as Phillippes household manager contributes to his charming film.  One of the best of 2012.I'm pleasantly surprised at the excellent quality of this Blu Ray transfer which come in 1080p resolution with an original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  In a nutshell the film is beautiful to watch.  It is rare that I pay much attention to the detail of clothing and accessories, but this transfers makes patterns pop off suits and jackets.  The colors are perfect and the clarity is first rate throughout.  Remarkable stuff.  I'm equally impressed by the care taken with the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 audio option.  Again surprising for an indi movie that relies primarily on dialog.  Music is central to the story however as Driss is a big fan of Earth Wind and Fire and other dance music from America.  Phillippe is a fan of classical and often has small orchestras perform at his home.  There is a funny scene at the opera.  So yes, there is plenty of music and it is well represented in the audio.  Excellent package which makes the film a great one to own.  The only thing missing are extras for those who are looking for them.  Just some deleted scenes and the usual handful of trailers.",5,4 1/2 stars (BLU RAY) for one of the best films of 2012,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,2708,"['global', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'be', 'sure', 'based-on-real-events', 'story', 'clutches', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'downfall', 'Instead', 'two', 'primary', 'characters', 'mesh', 'cultural', 'differences', 'upbeat', 'story', 'life', 'challenges.Phillippe', 'Francois', 'Cluzet', 'wealthy', 'quadriplegic', 'injured', 'hang', 'gliding', 'accident', 'attractive', 'secretary', 'Audrey', 'Fleurot', 'are', 'interviewing', 'men', 'who', 'will', 'aid', 'Phillippe', 'dressing', 'bathing', 'other', 'hygiene', 'concerns', 'interviewees', 'Driss', 'Omar', 'Sy', 'who', 'immigrated', 'France', 'Senegal', 'boy', 'Driss', 'grown', 'up', 'streets', 'small', 'time', 'hoodlum', 'mother', 'kicked', 'crowded', 'apartment.Driss', 'intention', 'getting', 'job', 'signature', 'saying', 'was', 'there', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'unemployment', 'check', 'Surprisingly', 'Phillippe', 'guy', 'smart', 'ass', 'attitude', 'hired', 'point', 'question', 'where', 'will', 'head', 'journey', 'good', 'one.Phillippe', 'renewed', 'sense', 'adventure', 'Driss', 'boss', 'Maserati', 'dangerously', 'Parisian', 'streets', 'then', 'Driss', 'sets', 'Phillippe', 'up', 'date', 'unseen', 'correspondent', 'Driss', 'introduced', 'fine', 'arts', 'classical', 'music', 'opera', 'painting', 'worlds', 'are', 'also', 'expanded', 'different', 'directions', 'Written', 'directed', 'Eric', 'Toledano', 'Olivier', 'Nakache', 'film', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'acted', 'joy', 'warmth', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'headed', 'Anne', 'Le', 'Ny', 'Phillippes', 'household', 'manager', 'charming', 'film', 'One', 'best', '2012.I', ""'m"", 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'excellent', 'quality', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'transfer', 'come', '1080p', 'resolution', 'original', '1.85:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'nutshell', 'film', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'rare', 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'detail', 'clothing', 'accessories', 'transfers', 'patterns', 'pop', 'off', 'suits', 'jackets', 'colors', 'are', 'perfect', 'clarity', 'first', 'rate', 'Remarkable', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'equally', 'impressed', 'care', 'taken', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'audio', 'option', 'Again', 'surprising', 'indi', 'movie', 'primarily', 'dialog', 'Music', 'central', 'story', 'however', 'Driss', 'big', 'fan', 'Earth', 'Wind', 'Fire', 'other', 'dance', 'music', 'America', 'Phillippe', 'fan', 'classical', 'often', 'small', 'orchestras', 'perform', 'home', 'funny', 'scene', 'opera', 'So', 'yes', 'plenty', 'music', 'well', 'represented', 'audio', 'Excellent', 'package', 'film', 'great', 'one', 'own', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'are', 'extras', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'Just', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'usual', 'handful', 'trailers']",N/A

Driss seems to not care about much but himself, although he is also dealing with family issues in parts of the movie. But Driss and Philippe strike a bond, and become closer as the movie develops. I don't want to give more away from the plot as you'll just have to see how it all plays out, but I will say there are some surprises.That said, this is a great mocie, and as such the ""feel good"" movie of the year so far. It was a packed house when I saw it this weekend at my local indie theatre here in Cincinnati, and the crowd just loved it, laughing at many occasions. But the movie really didn't hit home for me until the credits rolled and, low and behold, it brought some actual footage from the real Philippe and Driss in one of the scenes recreated in the movie.

A true story it is said, and it does give the human relationships a positive spin.Philippe, played by Francois Cluzet, is a millionaire who was paralyzed from the neck down in a para-gliding accident. Driss, played by Omar Sy is a man out on parole for robbery, who applies for the job of Philippe's caregiver only so he can get a signature on his application for unemployment benefits. What Philippe needs is not only physical help but someone to cheer him up. Phillipe dares Driss to take the job for a month,and off they go. Driss is irreverent and clueless at times, and Phillipe is taking quite a chance. But, then, what does he have to lose?Off they go on adventures. Driss  pushes Phillipe through the Parisian night when Phillipe has an anxiety attack. They partake of cultural activities, art, opera, birthday parties and dating. Driss has the feet, Phillipe has the mind and money. This partnership is something each of them needs, and is an equalizer. One issue is the black/white divide, rich/poor divide. Not much is said of it, but it is there, staring us right in the face.This is a feel good film, tears at times, but the stupors is refreshing and a good time. The two actors,superb. Francois Cluzot, who plays Phillipe, moves only his face, and his remarkable features set the pace. Omar Sy the devil may care, Driss, and the man who is always moving, always looking for a woman.

Co-written along with Eric Toledano, and also directed by Olivier Nakache, we are allowed to happily fall head over heals for the two main characters and the necessity of each to the other that is born from their exchanges.  Fully explored characters in a joyful discourse that is delightful, life giving and sustaining as well as vastly entertaining, Philipe is in for the ride of his life with Driss, literally.Philipe is at a point in his life where people pitying him is tiring, plainly not working and never was.  Driss breezes into his life bringing his own fresh air and forgets that Phillipe is even quadriplegic from time to time.  For instance; when the phone rings, Driss will mistakenly just hand it to Philipe without a thought.  The idea of an untrained outlook on life from the point of view of a person without a medical background being the one to help him with his private matters is intoxicating in many ways.  It appears that these two gentlemen need each other for two different reasons that equal perfection.People in Philipe's upscale world first worry whom he has hired as Driss was not properly interviewed for the position, only stumbled into the home by happenstance on the day one was to be employed.  Simply wanting a signature from him to show he had asked for a job to satisfy the accounting for his benefit money.  Philipe takes such a shine to his unpolished nature that the position is his on a trial basis, along with his own private rooms and access to a world of privilege.  This all happening at the time his mother just tossed him from his home for his rebellious and fast handed nature.  A case of serendipity for the two of them, they get along like clockwork and the viewer is treated to a situation that works all the way around.The film is beautifully shot (Mathieu Vadepied) all over the French countryside. Philippe's sprawling Paris estate, by the water's edge, restaurants, zipping around in luxurious automobiles and just out of doors for walks when Philipe goes into physical distress deep in the night.  The movie presents an astounding soundtrack (Ludovico Einaudi) featuring a wondrous solo piano throughout.  It is definitely a highlight for this thematic 'buddy' movie that rings a bit more like a bridge over troubled waters for them both than a caretaker and patient.  I didn't view it at all in this manner and neither did my box of Kleenex.  Certainly a have to watch when you are in the mood for an elegantly gritty, funny and emotional movie.

Well, I have to jump on the band wagon too! I watched this French film last night knowing nothing and couldn't stop laughing for the full 122 minutes. A funny and sweet comedy about a quadriplegic? Only the French could pull this off.  And it's based on a true story.You may have already read other reviews her which describe the plot - whether in summary or detail - but, to be honest, it's best to discover what happens on the screen for yourself, so I won't give anything away, except to say that if the first five minutes - which occurs before the title even appears don't get you interested, then I'll be surprised. (And the great soundtrack adds a lot to the ""feel good"" feeling of the film.)Be aware that Amazon groups reviews of ALL versions of a release - whether DVD, Bluray, NTSC, with subtitles or without - so be careful to read the description of the release being reviewed. That said, this review is of the Blu-ray version being released on March 5th with English Subtitles.If there is one caveat I will make for those watching the film on a standard definition TV, it is that this is another recent case where the English subtitles are in white print directly on the screen image and not very large. The size is not the issue but there are quite a few scenes where the scenery is white and the subtitles are quite hard to read. I have to say that even on my 27in standard format TV, I missed about 5% of the dialogue (but I could still follow the story). Other recent foreign films I've reviewed recently have subtitles in green or the words are placed below the image, making it easy to read.Both the DVD and BD have the same single ""Special Feature"". It is a series of four deleted scenes. These total about six minutes. What is really odd is that the deleted scenes have subtitles which - though white - are at least 50% larger than the ones in the film and have a sharper contrast.No, I'm not deducting any stars - the film is that great that I'm just commenting on the subtitles. This is already my favorite film of 2012 and my bet to with the Oscar for Best Foreign Film! I'm sure those of you who have pre-ordered it through Amazon (remember you want the one with ENGLISH subtitles and NTSC) will find it well worth the wait.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,U.S. DVD Version - Can I give this film SIX stars?,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,2440,"['Okay', 'are', 'already', '44', 'reviews', 'film', 'review', 'are', 'raving', 'Well', 'have', 'jump', 'band', 'wagon', 'too', 'watched', 'French', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'full', '122', 'minutes', 'funny', 'sweet', 'comedy', 'quadriplegic', 'Only', 'French', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'based', 'true', 'story.You', 'may', 'have', 'already', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'plot', 'summary', 'detail', 'be', 'honest', 'best', 'discover', 'what', 'screen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'say', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'title', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'interested', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'lot', 'feel', 'good', 'feeling', 'film', 'Be', 'aware', 'Amazon', 'groups', 'reviews', 'ALL', 'versions', 'release', 'DVD', 'Bluray', 'NTSC', 'subtitles', 'so', 'be', 'careful', 'read', 'description', 'release', 'being', 'reviewed', 'said', 'review', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'being', 'released', 'March', '5th', 'English', 'Subtitles.If', 'one', 'caveat', 'will', 'make', 'watching', 'film', 'standard', 'definition', 'TV', 'recent', 'case', 'where', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'white', 'print', 'directly', 'screen', 'image', 'not', 'very', 'large', 'size', 'not', 'issue', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'scenery', 'white', 'subtitles', 'are', 'quite', 'hard', 'read', 'have', 'say', 'even', '27in', 'standard', 'format', 'TV', 'missed', 'about', '5', '%', 'dialogue', 'could', 'still', 'follow', 'story', 'Other', 'recent', 'foreign', 'films', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'recently', 'have', 'subtitles', 'green', 'words', 'are', 'placed', 'image', 'making', 'easy', 'read.Both', 'DVD', 'BD', 'have', 'same', 'single', 'Special', 'Feature', 'series', 'four', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'total', 'six', 'minutes', 'What', 'really', 'odd', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'have', 'subtitles', 'white', 'are', 'least', '50', '%', 'larger', 'ones', 'film', 'have', 'sharper', 'contrast.No', ""'m"", 'not', 'deducting', 'stars', 'film', 'great', ""'m"", 'just', 'commenting', 'subtitles', 'already', 'favorite', 'film', '2012', 'bet', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'who', 'have', 'pre-ordered', 'Amazon', 'remember', 'want', 'one', 'ENGLISH', 'subtitles', 'NTSC', 'will', 'find', 'well', 'wait.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

Despite (or because of) the differences in their social backgrounds and the fact that very outspoken Driss has no previous experience of caregiving, Philippe hires Driss, who helps Philippe sort out the deeper problems of his life.But make no mistake about this. ""The Intouchables"" is a comedy, though its approach is understated. The theme may be serious, but the film itself is free from seriousness that would have weighed down the whole movie. ""The Intouchables"" will not spend time in saying what is obvious. There is no overdramatizing in the script. You will hear no preachy messages. Instead of them, you will follow the simple story of two credible characters the directors team Olivier Nakache and &Eacute;ric Toledano have successfully created: Philippe and Driss.I for one thought the film would be more effective with shorter running time (the opening car chase sequence seems unnecessary). Also, I wanted to know more about some of the supporting characters, especially Philippe's secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot), with whom Driss flirts.Still, ""The Intouchables"" is engaging and compelling throughout, thanks to the nuanced performances from the leads.

After a long wait for the Region 1 DVD, Intouchables is a great, surprisingly hilarious, and rather watchable effort that does not really disappoint. Sy as the ballsy and confident Driss provides a performance that encapsulates a character who is funny, aware, and a realist. Cluzet provides a believable and ironic performance as Philippe showcasing his disability also signals his lack of amusement and sarcastic views about life. Even with positive feedback, the film does notably suffer from a precise narrative that emphasises on how Philippe came to be paraplegic and how he went to the hospital toward the end. The film, while it may deal with the struggles between the high-class and low-class, is not really politically-charged and controversial (as a film like La Haine would) more than it is an Oscar-like comedy-drama about human emotions and feelings dealing with disability, economic status, negligence, culture, family, and work ethics. Altogether, considering the fact that it mutes any direct politics, the film is best watched as a guilty pleasure given its positive, sometimes carefree perspective about life. Given this reason, it is no wonder why the film performed so well in Europe and even Australia and South Korea. Even if you are afraid of subtitles, the film will not make you look away or feel bored one bit when you see Driss make daily ends meet through following experimental methods of caring for Philippe and enhances his pretentious lifestyle.""",4,"Un effort merveilleux dans le talent, l'humeur et le scenario.

It is certainly one of the most enjoyable.  It is not, strictly speaking, a comedy, but it is so rich in humor and in human comedy that I found myself constantly laughing.  While fictional, The Intouchables is closely based on the real-life story of two men so starkly different in background and circumstances that it is difficult to imagine their lives even intersecting, let alone becoming intricately intertwined, and yet they did.  How it all came about is the story.The film begins with Driss (Omar Sy), a young African immigrant, driving a luxurious Maserati sports car at full tilt along the streets of Paris at night.  Riding with him is Phillipe (Franois Cluzet), an older Frenchman with a beard who seems to be taking his companion's breakneck driving with remarkable calm.  When the police inevitably start after them, Driss bets Phillipe a hundred euros he can shake them off, which Phillipe takes.  When he fails to shake them off, Driss then offers to double the wager that he can turn the police into an escort, to which Phillipe laughingly says he's crazy but accepts the wager anyway. Driss then cons the police into believing that he's speeding because he has to get Phillipe - who can't get out of the car when the police order him to because he's a quadriplegic, paralyzed from the neck down - to the emergency room of a hospital.  Phillipe, in spite of the wager, proceeds to support Driss's con by pretending to be having a stroke.  The police then hurriedly escort the pair to the nearest hospital, where Driss tells them he can handle things from there, and then the police leave.  After having a good laugh at their getting away with it, Phillipe asks ""What do we do now?"", to which Driss replies confidently ""Let me take care of it"" and they drive off.  The scene sets up the rest of the movie - most of which occurs in flashback - by showing at once how different the two men are and how in spite of their differences they have an intimately playful us-against-the-world relationship that quickly intrigues and engages.Flashing back to when Driss and Phillipe first met, we find Phillipe, a wealthy man who really is paralyzed from the neck down, in his Paris mansion, interviewing candidates with the help of his assistant Magalie (Audrey Fleurot) for a position as live-in caregiver to help with the more basic physical tasks that Phillipe needs but can no longer do for himself.  Candidate after candidate gives all the reasons why they'd be good for the position but Phillipe is clearly dissatisfied with all of them, not surprising when we learn that he's already gone through quite a few caregivers since becoming quadriplegic.  Enter Driss, a brash young man who cuts in ahead of other candidates, not wanting to wait because he's only there to get a paper signed indicating he was interviewed for the job and rejected so that he can qualify for welfare support.  He does everything wrong, openly revealing that he knows nothing about the job or the kind of work it involves and is only there to get his paper signed, even as he flirts outrageously with Magalie.  But at the same time he talks directly to Phillipe and even makes jokes, the only candidate to do so.  Intrigued, Phillipe tricks Driss into coming back, telling him to leave the paper and they will have it ready for him the next day.  When Driss returns, thinking he's only there to pick up his paper, Magalie takes him on a tour of the mansion, showing him in particular the room the caregiver will be living in - an extremely luxurious room bigger than the whole apartment Driss's aunt and four cousins occupy in a seedy Paris suburb- only at the end revealing to him that he's been hired.  Unable to resist the lure of all that luxury - and having nowhere else to go since his aunt kicked him out the night before - Driss decides to take the job.It is comical to watch as Driss settles into his job, showing open astonishment as he realizes the extent of Phillipe's limitations, loudly protesting at some of the duties he's expected to handle, like putting tight stockings on Phillipe's legs to help with their circulation just for openers.  But we quickly see why Phillipe chose him:  Driss is completely uninhibited and utterly without pretense, never holds back what he's thinking, and he interacts with Phillipe like he does with everyone else:  crude and irreverent and disrespectful of boundaries and proprieties, but always as a person.  And because Driss seems to be the only person who can make Phillipe laugh.  I found myself constantly laughing at the humorous moments, but mainly it was in delight at the human comedy unfolding on the screen.There are so many delightful scenes in The Intouchables, a lot of which center around either Driss drawing Phillipe out of his comfort zone or Phillipe drawing Driss out of his.  The first time Phillipe wants to go out for a ride, instead of the van designed to accommodate him and his wheelchair, Driss insists on taking the Maserati Quattroporte he sees instead.  ""Why would you want to ride around in that,"" he asks incredulously, dismissing the van, ""when you have this?""  The van never gets used after that.  Later, once Driss has gotten Phillipe to come out of himself more, Phillipe decides to go para-sailing again (it was in fact a para-sailing accident that left him paralyzed). Driss thinks Phillipe is crazy, loudly protesting that there's no way Phillipe is going to get him to try it. And then the next thing we see is Driss para-sailing, screaming in total terror at first but soon laughing and shouting at how incredible the experience is.  And one of the best scenes is at Phillipe's birthday party where the guests listen to a live chamber music group that Phillipe has hired. After most of the guests have gone and the musicians are about to leave, Phillipe impulsively tells them to stay, wanting to expose Driss to a variety of classical music, to which Driss responds, reluctantly at first, but then finally seeming to see what Phillipe gets out of it. Driss then turns around and plugs in his MP3 player, taking the opportunity to show Phillipe the kind of music he likes - Earth, Wind & Fire in particular - and soon he has the party rocking with everyone joining him on the dance floor.In addition to the humor though, there are a lot of serious moments. Both Driss and Phillipe have their troubles.  Driss's relationship with his aunt is rocky because of his irresponsibility and his troubles with the law, and he sees one of his younger cousins is being lured into the gang life.  Phillipe misses his wife, who died of cancer before his accident.  His adopted daughter is a spoiled brat, he has a poetic pen-pal relationship with a women he longs to meet but is afraid to reveal his physical situation to, and he suffers periodically from excruciating phantom pains that he can do nothing about but endure.There is a lot more that I could mention about what happens in the film, but I think it best not to say anything further.  It's simply too much fun to see things unfold as the relationship between Driss and Phillipe develops, both in the humorous moments as well as the more serious ones, so I will leave those pleasures for others to discover.The cast are all very natural and their performances first-class, but Franois Cluzet's Phillipe and Omar Sy's Driss are truly outstanding in their roles.  Cluzet - who bears a striking resemblance to Dustin Hoffman - in some ways has the more difficult task as he can only use his face to convey everything about Phillipe's character, a particular challenge given Omar Sy's infectious and animated physicality.  But Cluzet does more than hold his own, showing Phillipe's evolution as his expressions grow less contained and more open as his relationship with Driss draws him out of himself.  Sy's challenge is more subtle as he must convey Driss's gradual maturing as new worlds and ideas are opened to him, and as he finds himself becoming more responsible, both in his relationship with Phillipe and in his attitude towards his family.  Both actors succeed marvelously, making their characters and the complex relationship the two share completely believable.  I later learned from reading about The Intouchables that Omar Sy appeared in three films that Nakache and Toledano did prior to this one.  Judging by his performance in The Intouchables, it's easy to see why they keep casting him.It would be easy - if one has not actually seen The Intouchables - to dismiss it as just another ""buddy"" or ""odd-couple"" movie.  That would be a big mistake, because you'd be denying yourself a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  When it was released in late 2011, The Intouchables quickly became the second-biggest grossing film in French movie history.  Internationally, it is the biggest grossing non-English film, beating the record formerly held by Miyazaki's Spirited Away, proof that the appeal of the film and of its truly memorable characters is indeed universal.Highly, highly recommended for everyone.  It may well be the best film you'll see all year.  It will certainly be the one you'll most enjoy having seen.",5,An unexpected delight,1343520000,"07 29, 2012",2012,9328,"['Intouchables', 'French', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'team', 'Olivier',
