The acting was not the greatest, but these where not listed as top actress or actors. The plot was good. A young lady that thinks she is all that and above all others just bieng the daughter of well to do family. Spends money how and when she wants. Then its time to know what real friends act like. And really learn that is it better to give sometimes.This young girl I believe was in one on T.Perry's plays, she can really sing. Now would have like 2 see more singing from the teens.Many think they can do a much better job when I read reviews and they say that movie sucks and the acting was trouble, but they may not have had to make a movie in a week, or the actress walks out and they had to just make do with whom they have. But at lease they tried, and to get a point across.",3,Christmas at Water's Edge DVE,1225584000,"11 2, 2008",2008,901,"['happen', 'be', 'okay', 'move', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'bad', 'words', 'many', 'thing', 'one', 'must', 'use', 'get', 'point', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'greatest', 'where', 'not', 'listed', 'top', 'actress', 'actors', 'plot', 'was', 'good', 'young', 'lady', 'others', 'just', 'bieng', 'daughter', 'well', 'do', 'family', 'money', 'how', 'when', 'Then', 'time', 'know', 'what', 'real', 'act', 'really', 'learn', 'better', 'give', 'sometimes.This', 'young', 'girl', 'believe', 'was', 'one', 'T.Perry', 'plays', 'can', 'really', 'sing', 'Now', 'would', 'have', '2', 'see', 'more', 'singing', 'teens.Many', 'think', 'can', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'when', 'read', 'reviews', 'say', 'movie', 'sucks', 'acting', 'was', 'trouble', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'make', 'movie', 'week', 'actress', 'out', 'had', 'just', 'make', 'do', 'whom', 'have', 'lease', 'tried', 'get', 'point', 'across']",Christmas at Water's Edge

It's on my list to watch every Christmas.  It's a feel-good movie that's nice to watch during the holidays.  Tom Bosley was a nice surprise. I had not seen him since Happy Days!  It was easy for me to watch because I could relate to the family's economic status better than most black movies. No profanity. No &#34;over done&#34; romantic scenes.
