It is a shame!  Shame!  One can only hope that there will be a re-think on this show despite the fact that most of the actors have gone on to other projects.

Garrow's Law is the best Georgian era series I've ever encountered. The plots are dramatic, the costumes perfect, and the attention to historical detail extreme.

1504790,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B005WJX1Q4,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[0, 0]","I think the most fascinating aspect of Garrow's Law is that this is not a fictional account. Although not as widely known as perhaps he warrants, William Garrow was a prominent English lawyer, initially specialising in defence and subsequently becoming a Member of Parliament and Solicitor General.Garrow is widely credited as being the father of the adversarial system of justice which is in use in many countries with forthright cross examination of witnesses. His insistence that hearsay evidence should not be admissible led to the rules on `best evidence'. Each of these episodes is based on a true case from the annals of the Old Bailey, England's premier criminal court, although not necessarily one which Garrow was involved with. For example this season's first episode concerns a disturbed individual called James Hadfield. He has directed a shot towards the Prince Regent at Drury Lane Theatre and, it emerges, was attempting suicide in what would be described in the modern idiom as `death by cop'. A quick search through Google will confirm that, as with all cases in Garrow's Law, this was a real case.Garrow's personal life is also based on fact, as he had a long term relationship and later married Sarah, who had previously borne a child by a Viscount. Obviously the script writer has had to fill in the gaps, but it appears that the significant facts which can be checked out are correct so what we have here is a fascinating insight into the workings of the legal system a little over two hundred years ago, and the life and work of a highly influential individual.As in the previous two series the main criticism is that the season is so short, comprising only four episodes to go with the eight previously. There is a tendency in the UK towards short series although four seems to be taking this to extremes. Perhaps basing the stories on real cases is the limiting factor here. The really bad news is that it has now been confirmed that there will be no more series of Garrow's Law for reasons which are not clear.",5,Fascinating Insight into English Law 200 Years Ago,1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,2036,"['think', 'most', 'fascinating', 'aspect', 'Garrow', 'Law', 'not', 'fictional', 'account', 'not', 'widely', 'known', 'perhaps', 'warrants', 'William', 'Garrow', 'was', 'prominent', 'English', 'lawyer', 'initially', 'specialising', 'defence', 'subsequently', 'becoming', 'Member', 'Parliament', 'Solicitor', 'General.Garrow', 'widely', 'credited', 'being', 'father', 'adversarial', 'system', 'justice', 'use', 'many', 'countries', 'forthright', 'cross', 'examination', 'witnesses', 'insistence', 'hearsay', 'evidence', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'admissible', 'led', 'rules', 'best', 'evidence', 'episodes', 'based', 'true', 'case', 'annals', 'Old', 'Bailey', 'England', 'premier', 'criminal', 'court', 'not', 'necessarily', 'one', 'Garrow', 'was', 'involved', 'example', 'season', 'first', 'episode', 'concerns', 'disturbed', 'individual', 'called', 'James', 'Hadfield', 'directed', 'shot', 'Prince', 'Regent', 'Drury', 'Lane', 'Theatre', 'was', 'attempting', 'suicide', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'described', 'modern', 'idiom', 'death', 'cop', 'quick', 'search', 'Google', 'will', 'confirm', 'that', 'cases', 'Garrow', 'Law', 'was', 'real', 'case.Garrow', 'personal', 'life', 'also', 'based', 'fact', 'had', 'long', 'term', 'relationship', 'later', 'married', 'Sarah', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'borne', 'child', 'Viscount', 'Obviously', 'script', 'writer', 'had', 'fill', 'gaps', 'significant', 'facts', 'can', 'be', 'checked', 'out', 'are', 'correct', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'fascinating', 'insight', 'workings', 'legal', 'system', 'little', 'over', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'life', 'work', 'highly', 'influential', 'individual.As', 'previous', 'two', 'series', 'main', 'criticism', 'season', 'so', 'short', 'comprising', 'only', 'four', 'episodes', 'go', 'eight', 'previously', 'tendency', 'UK', 'towards', 'short', 'series', 'four', 'be', 'taking', 'extremes', 'Perhaps', 'basing', 'stories', 'real', 'cases', 'limiting', 'factor', 'here', 'really', 'bad', 'news', 'now', 'been', 'confirmed', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'series', 'Garrow', 'Law', 'reasons', 'are', 'not', 'clear']",Garrow's Law: Series 3

The loss of Alun Armstrong as part of the proceedings is keenly felt, and the entire conflict with Sarah and Arthur over Samuel is tidied up too neatly, albeit in a very satisfying way. I get the feeling that they knew they were not going to get a new season at this point and had to charge through at a breakneck pace to tidy up all the lose ends, but Garrow's turns in the courtroom are no less powerful for all of that. He may not be able to bring down the guilty parties in the end, but the fate of the revolting Lord Meville is sure to delight those who have been watching both seasons.

I think particularly here in the States, the history we got in school and then our subsequent interest in this era is geared more to the American and French Revolutions -so we missed the fascinating occurrences in Britain just as it was to emerge as a super power in the Victorian era.In series three, madness is given a legal definition, trade unions vs exploitation of labor are considered, grotesque abuses of power in the colonies -and what defines a human being- is taken up in court, and finally Garrow's personal life with Sarah is resolved as the odious Lord Melville gets his comeuppance.I wish there were more episodes and am sad to see an end to this unique series.
