I have to say that my poor review has nothing to do with the content of Season 6. My problem is with the packaging of the five discs that make up the Blu-Ray edition of the dvd collection.  I have Season 7 and they have changed the packaging to make it easier to get the discs out of the case.  I have a feeling they must have had a lot of complaints about how the packaging in Season 6 could cause the purchaser to bend the top discs, which would be disc 1 and 3.  I carefully got out Disc 1 but when I tried to get Disc 3 out of the container I bent it very slightly yet enough to make it unusable.  It was my mistake and since my printer is broken I don't know how to return it. I am just warning people that although it WAS MY FAULT I think you should know that it is very difficult to remove two of the five discs from the box. It was just very disappointing and it makes me feel like I don't want to watch anymore.  Maybe other people will have solutions to this problem which could be helpful.

It was truly the remarkable element of a clash of conscience as House's team is forced to diagnose an African dictator. For this particular episode the old team of Cameron, Chase and Foreman are back together, yet the team does not last long as this is the lighting of the destructive fuse. Guest starring one of my favourite actors, James Earl Jones, this sees Cameron and Chase struggling with their consciences as they consider the fact that if they save this tyrants life then he will go to his home country to commit mass genocide. The choice made and the person who made the choice will actually become quite a shock, but I promise this will be an episode enjoyed by many.As this is one of the first episodes that House is truly free from the psychiatric hospital and has become involved once again with diagnostics. The team have returned as a means of filling the void left by House and Foreman is the guy in charge. Now House is back, Foremans power is threatened and he's not pleased. House uses this to his advantage and starts to play games with Foreman by mocking him while he's trying to do his job. This is a good glimpse of the same old House whilst still being able to appreciate that the man is trying to change his ways and make amends to those he has wronged.

By having him be in therapy and solving a case simultaneously, this put Hugh Laurie at the center of the action at all times.  It is hard to think of a time he was not on camera.  And that is the secret to this show.  When this is done, the show is a brilliant 5 stars.  When the focus is shifted to anyone else, it starts losing ground.  Those characters are only interesting as they revolve around House. For example, Wilson and Sam want House to move out to his own place.  This is what throws House into crisis mode.  So Wilson was used but Wilson was not central to the show. Ditto as to everyone else.  The character I enjoyed the next most was House's psychiatrist.  I think he should be brought back more frequently as his repartee with House is quite good, much better than anyone else's.

1272590,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B002JVWR7M,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[2, 3]","First let me say that I am a huge fan of this show and especially Hugh Laurie (loved Jeeves & Wooster).  I think he is one of the best actors on television and is the reason why this show is such a hit.Here are my insights: the first episode is brilliant!  House in the asylum to get off the pain killers and deal with the hallucinations.  Now, it is great but is in no way based on any fragment of reality.  This is television, and one must understand the nature of artistic license.  Yes they make you stick your tongue out after taking your medicine to make sure you swallowed it.  Yes they escort people to phones and monitor patients around the clock.  Yes they have alarms on most doors.  No, House would not have been able to drive out (their would undoubtedly be a gate and guard).  But the episode is not about the inner workings of an asylum, but about House progressing as a character.Now once the show gets back on track is where it falls short.  Season 5 had its ups and downs but overall had good drama and good medical mysteries.  It seems they are bored with the interesting yet realistic cases from before and coming up with crazier and crazier story lines.  Still entertaining.What I don't like is how Wilson takes a backseat in this season.  Like Murray in Flight of the Conchords, Wilson is the glue that holds the show together.  Where seasons 1 and 2 excelled was in the play between House, Wilson, and Cuddy.  Now there is a relationship starting, and it seems to be going the Grey's Anatomy direction.Still the cases are interesting, and they don't have the horrid American Idol type competition for the 'America's next top Princeton Plainsborough Teaching Hospital Diagnostic Medicine Department Fellowships' like season 4 (God that was awful); and the surprise death (and terrible episode) at the end of season 4.  I am also happy that we  got rid of one annoying character in season 5 and another in season 6 (though this character does make some reappearances).  So three main characters out in 6 seasons... not too bad (definitely not as screwy as ER got).Olivia Wilde is brilliant as always, Omar Epps is good, but not as brilliant as he was in seasons 1-3.  I do like that Chase gets into the action.  He is a rather enjoyable character to watch.  He has some issues in this season and really develops as a character.The show is still great, but it needs to close out soon.  I hope for the integrity of the show they end at season 7. It is losing steam and I don't want it to end up like ER!In my opinion seasons 1-3 are the best and rate about equal to me, then 5, then 6, then a big step down to 4 (a whole slew of unimportant, uninteresting characters and cases).",4,"Better than season 4, not as good as 5",1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,2697,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'especially', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'loved', 'Jeeves', 'Wooster', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'television', 'reason', 'why', 'show', 'such', 'hit.Here', 'are', 'insights', 'first', 'episode', 'brilliant', 'House', 'asylum', 'get', 'off', 'pain', 'killers', 'deal', 'hallucinations', 'Now', 'great', 'way', 'based', 'fragment', 'reality', 'television', 'one', 'must', 'understand', 'nature', 'artistic', 'license', 'Yes', 'make', 'stick', 'tongue', 'taking', 'medicine', 'make', 'sure', 'swallowed', 'Yes', 'escort', 'people', 'phones', 'monitor', 'patients', 'clock', 'Yes', 'have', 'alarms', 'most', 'doors', 'No', 'House', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'drive', 'out', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'gate', 'guard', 'episode', 'not', 'inner', 'workings', 'asylum', 'House', 'progressing', 'character.Now', 'show', 'back', 'track', 'where', 'short', 'Season', '5', 'had', 'ups', 'downs', 'overall', 'had', 'good', 'drama', 'good', 'medical', 'mysteries', 'are', 'bored', 'interesting', 'yet', 'realistic', 'cases', 'coming', 'up', 'crazier', 'crazier', 'story', 'lines', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'Wilson', 'backseat', 'season', 'Murray', 'Flight', 'Conchords', 'Wilson', 'glue', 'show', 'together', 'Where', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'excelled', 'was', 'play', 'House', 'Wilson', 'Cuddy', 'Now', 'relationship', 'starting', 'be', 'going', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'cases', 'are', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'horrid', 'American', 'Idol', 'type', 'competition', ""'America"", 'next', 'top', 'Princeton', 'Plainsborough', 'Teaching', 'Hospital', 'Diagnostic', 'Medicine', 'Department', 'Fellowships', 'season', '4', 'God', 'was', 'awful', 'surprise', 'death', 'terrible', 'episode', 'end', 'season', '4', 'am', 'also', 'happy', 'got', 'rid', 'one', 'annoying', 'character', 'season', '5', 'season', '6', 'character', 'make', 'reappearances', 'So', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'out', '6', 'seasons', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'definitely', 'not', 'as', 'screwy', 'ER', 'got', '.Olivia', 'Wilde', 'brilliant', 'always', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'brilliant', 'was', 'seasons', '1-3', 'do', 'Chase', 'action', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'character', 'watch', 'issues', 'season', 'really', 'character.The', 'show', 'still', 'great', 'close', 'out', 'soon', 'hope', 'integrity', 'show', 'end', 'season', '7', 'losing', 'steam', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'up', 'ER', 'opinion', 'seasons', '1-3', 'are', 'best', 'rate', 'equal', 'then', '5', 'then', '6', 'then', 'big', 'step', 'down', '4', 'whole', 'slew', 'unimportant', 'uninteresting', 'characters', 'cases']",N/A

Catering to those who enjoy the soap opera drama, entire episodes are dedicated to the personal lives of characters... usually these episodes are light or almost completely House free, and have little or nothing to do with any medical case.  This is not the show I used to watch... I don't care about this stuff as much, if I wanted to watch a soap opera drama, I would.  They have resorted to tremendous shock value to keep the drama high, reaching ridiculous heights that are unbelievable at best, and even if conceivable, become less and less realistic as more and more shocking drama is piled on on each character and their relationships.  The show has gone from a very interesting quirky well written show about medical mysteries and playfully dabbling but never or rarely delving deeply, into the characters lives, to being a full blown character driven drama about their relationships.  There are very few episodes in the season focusing on a case, most of them are focusing on the characters and their unbelievable personal drama.On top of that, Fox has decided to up the shock value... a lot.  Now we have unbelievable and insane things happening, gross violent disturbing incredibly out of proportion with reality shock value things happening, to both the main characters and to the patients.  It is as if they gave up on garnering our attention with the quality story telling that drove the first 5 seasons, and now are hoping that we will want to see why something horrific and purely placed for shock value, will turn out.  It's appealing to more morbid curiosity, I believe, then the gripping suspense and curiosity that the first 5 seasons carefully cultivated in the minds of the viewers.  I find it cheap, and annoying.  It would be one thing if they had a huge ""shocking"" scene once in a while, but every other episode or so, it is getting tiring, and feeling a bit like a bunch of juveniles are writing it, trying to think of the most gross or disturbing thing they can.And be ready for a lot of repeats.  Repeats of previous cases, extremely similar to the point of being nearly identical resolutions and symptoms.  I see they have gotten lazier with their research... it is really a shame.  I feel like I'm watching older episodes, except, they are lesser versions of themselves.I'm very disappointed... I was dearly hoping that this season would build upon the end of the fifth, though I was very skeptical of how they could develop upon that and still keep the show ""House.""  It seems they couldn't.  I started watching the first few episodes on TV, and after about the 5th or 6th I gave up on it.  after the second or third, it just felt like a chore, I was watching waiting for the ""good part"" to start, not enjoying any of them... finally I gave up on it, a show I used to watch constantly.  My father convinced me to give the show a second chance, and I watched the second season on Hulu to decide if I wanted to buy it, but, it just kept disappointing me.  It gets... less terrible later in the season, but the writing has suffered tremendously, and the shock value and drama I find annoying, and pandering to those who are less interested in an intelligent show that makes you think, and more interested in something closer to a day time soap opera.  If you are watching House, you are probably not looking for the later.I wouldn't recommend it.  I am keeping it at season 5.  That is the end of the show for me, because that is when it stopped being good.  Now, it is a drama set in a hospital with lots of gore and spooky disturbing shocking things thrown in like salting a dish.  Bleh at best.

House checks himself into Psychiatric hospital after seeing multiple hallucinations of dead cast members. Amber and Kutner. Season 6, opens without ONE words of explanation about his hallucinations. Suddenly they vanished without ANY explanation or discussion. That is poor continuity. The rest of Season 6 can be divided literally in half. Every episode up until Cameron Leaves (claiming House has ruined her husband) was good. Not as good as episodes in previous seasons, but still viewable TV. Just about every episode after Cameron departs is a thin veil of what House should be. It no longer is about PEOPLE and emotions and deep character studies, it tried to focus on illnesses that were not even that interesting. The background score/ music was gone, (suddenly the background score STOPPED mid season without explanation). The writing became dumber just as House became less intellectual and took up ""speed dating"" ( when  a series runs out of ideas this is what we are left with). This is the weakest season ever. it eneded with a ridiculous two parter cliff hanger in which House and Cutty are again about to start a relationship. Seems very forced. the VERY coarse and rude , sometimes bogoted HOUSE character is tamer, lamer, and apparantely not taking handfuls of Vicodin. The interpersonal relationships that made the show work are sadly missing since mid-season. You can basically skip over  many episodes, they offer very little interest past episodes after Camerons departure unless your ONLY interest in watching the show is to guess what disease someone has. Shoddy season, doesnt hold a candle to earlier seasons. I think Season 7 is going to be the last.

That brilliant doctors in their ownright would except intern level type positions, that are supposed to be short term, and continuing working with the world's biggest ass,  stretches the imagination.The show consistantly swapping supporting characters is damaging the show. It's not clear season to season or even mid season who will be fired or back working for House again. Its difficult to grow and like the characters when you can't count on them being there.

I liked the twist on ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"", but the gay/bi-sexual centric episodes seem to remind me of the beginning of the end for ""The Sopranos"" series; everyone's sex life was not that interesting as the writers seem to think.The show is both educational and entertaining, but began to have a ""Perry Mason"" quality this season.  With ""Perry Mason"", the primary criminal is always magically overcome and confesses to everything about 2-3 minutes from the shows ending.  With House, the patient seems to have a seizure, stroke, heart attack, and/or bleeding out before House finally realizes they are treating the wrong thing and magically pulls out an obsure diagnoses that saves the day, can't be cured or is too late.Also, I can accept House as an borderline insane, heroic, law breaking, but searching atheist, supported by a secular cast of characters with similar arrogant outlooks of being their own gods.  I become uninterested in House when he looses his partially open mind to spiritual questions, his slowly growing recognition of humanity as sacred, and begins to ignore that comprehending the devinely complex design of the human body is what motivates him, or he starts to form some oddball concept of God or religion.I also did not like the time gaps in relationship changes with characters, and no explanation of what happened until much later.  I still think of House's team as a family, it seemed disjointed this season.  I did like the P.I.

We see just how frustrating and difficult her day at the hospital is, dealing not only with the stubborn and often sneaky House, but the board of directors and many others. Her day, which begins before dawn and ends long after most others are already in bed, is only compounded by her private investigator boyfriend and troubles with her sick baby Rachel.Finally, the last episode 22 - ""Help Me"" - finds all our main characters at the site of a devastating building collapse.

Hugh Laurie is now only incidentally a doctor. He seems to be a sort of political prisoner caught in a mental ward. His captor is black. Perhaps they discovered that he didn't vote for Obama?The black guy, Andre Braugher - who should have won the Oscar for best suporting actor in ""Glory"" (not Denzel Washington)- has let himself go. He's quite fat now. He now looks like Cedric the Entertainer or Eddie Murphy in one of his fat suits. A couple seasons ago they had a huge fat black guy play a billionaire villian. He was effective because he was taller than Laurie. As was the scary white cop played by David Morse. House the character is very, very smart and Laurie the actor is pretty tall and fit (he boxes for sport), so even with his bum leg he is a hard man to intimidate. This makes playing the plot menace difficult. Braugher - the new chubby Braugher - is not up to the task.I missed this episode when it was broadcast so I bought it here at Amazon throgh Roku.

Mental health lessons are everywhere, with many having been deftly inserted between the lines.  As careful as the writers and producers have been all these years with the aspects of the show which need to be factual, I believe this episode does also have useful reality among the fantasy.  The story twists qualify for all shades of surprise.  I guarantee at least one scene will make you laugh aloud, sufficiently to wake your neighbors.  I also guarantee at least one scene will make you hold your breath.

Can we just agree on that point?  Hugh Laurie is a supremely skilled actor, hence the extra star for this claptrap.  But he is forced to portray such a woman-hating scoundrel that I'm surprised more of us haven't boycotted the thing.I can also appreciate the medical research that goes into the writing of this admittedly well-made show.  But why do the femmes in the cast have to be portrayed as such ball busting intolerable idiots?  We are better than that!  Cutty is played by Lisa Edelstein, who was actually very effective as Maeve Fox in ""A Date with Darkness: The Trial and Capture of Andrew Luster"" - now there's a femme that can be looked up to!  But on this show, Edelstein (middle-aged, but still beautiful in a ""plain jane"" way) is made to look like a buffoon.Jennifer Morrison is also horribly utilized as ""Dr."" Cameron.  Sure, and I'm the Queen of Sheeba!  Cameron is basically a soap opera character, along with Chase (Jesse Spencer), and they have no business still being on the show for season 6!  They were part of House's team in earlier seasons, so even though I wanted to strangle them at least they served a purpose on the program!  In Season Six, they are deadweight and everyone knows it.  Cameron is an airhead, if you must know!  And very disrespectful to Chase, on top of it.  Nonsense like this makes my neofeminist blood boil.I hope the craze over this overrated show is nearing an end.  I will probably still keep watching the new season, because unlike many reviewers I actually do see the products I offer my informed opinions of.

1272637,AE3OAGMSGIIUI,B002JVWR7M,Travis,"[1, 2]","This is my personal favorite season of ""House"" yet. Unlike the previous season, the writing team seemed a lot more focused on season-long themes and arcs while still managing to step outside the box. Season Six might best be characterized as ""the concept episode season"" as its highlights include the double-length season premiere chronicling House's time in an institution; a pair of ""a day in the life of"" episodes that both work well; and ""Lockdown"" (separating and isolating our characters during a hospital lockdown, giving them a chance to interact in ways outside their normal situations).Crohn's Bonus: One of the patients is diagnosed with ""extra intestinal"" Crohn's disease!The House/Wilson relationship is in full bromance form throughout this season, and the chemistry between Hugh Laurie and Robert Sean Leonard is one of the most compelling elements of the series. Bonus: someone had the inspiration to cast Andre Braugher as House's therapist, and that was a stroke of genius. Braugher is one of the few with the gravitas to hold the screen against Laurie, without taking you out of the episode.Regarding the DVD release, there are four commentary tracks (including one on the aforementioned double-length opener) and a handful of brief, but at least interesting, featurettes. I haven't played any of the commentaries yet, but I felt more rewarded by the featurettes here than I did by those on the Season Five box. Also, and it's a little thing, but I really dig the teal layout of the package design.
