The title itself should obviously probably be, MY GIRLFRIEND IS A SPY. I mean, like, What Is ""An Agent?""

1276477,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002LHMD50,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","My sole Korean-speaking swag consists of my knowing the original title of this 2009 movie: Chilgeup gongmuwon. For western audiences the title is either 7th Grade Civil Servant or My Girlfriend is an Agent (pick your preference). Chilgeup gongmuwon made a huge impression on the Korean box office, never mind that, for me, this was only a 3 out of 5 stars flick. It's hit or miss, more hit than miss.As always with foreign-language cinema, I recommend that you watch it with the original language playing and read the English sub-titles. It's rare that I'm down with English dubbing. This one does lift a page from Mr. & Mrs. Smith but there's also a whiff of True Lies. Anh Soo Ji (Ha-Neul Kang) is a savvy covert operative who has to keep lying to her boyfriend to maintain her cover. That poor sap, Lee Jaejung (Ji-Hwan Kang), finally gets fed up with Anh Soo Ji's falsehoods, and he dumps her and amscrays to Canada to study international accounting. Because that's what you do when your heart gets all broke.Three years go by before the ex-lovers bump into each other, and in a men's restroom (don't ask). Festering emotions boil over; there's a huge row, and you think that's that. But then they keep running into each other, with Anh Soo Ji still persisting in pretense. But here's a shift in the ""relationship"": Lee Jaejung is now a fledgling spy for another espionage agency. So now they're both pushing a masquerade.The film's McGuffin revolves around a deadly weaponized chemical agent coveted by the Russian mob. What are the odds that both our characters get mixed up in this? (Odds are good.)2009's Chilgeup gongmuwon was popular enough that it inspired a television series in 2013. I thought both the lead actors were fine, and they generate a good spark between them. Ji-Hwan Kang toes a more delicate balance as he's portrayed as the more comic of the two roles (Ha-Neul Kang lands the more standard, play-it-straight part). Ji-Hwan Kang at times will remind you of an anime or manga character. He's got this tendency to shriek in girly high pitch whenever he's in jeopardy. Where his ex is an experienced secret agent, Ji-Hwan Kang's rookie spy is a bit of a goof-up who is often berated by his immediate superior. His undercover scenes make for some pretty, um, curious capers. I grinned quite a bit because the poor sap was endearing, even though I did get frustrated with how bumbling he was. I don't know why but it cracked me up that he had to have a different password for each of his computer file. It sure drove his immediate superior batty.So I would say that Chilgeup gongmuwon succeeds with the comedy bits, is less than successful with the action bits. Several stunts could've been choreographed better, like the silly fencing and jet ski sequences. The script is scattershot. Thankfully, there's enough of what's solid in the interactions between the two leads that I could put up with the nonsense portions of the film.",3,"when you're briefing a room of hardcore spies, it's not cool when your mom calls",1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,2951,"['sole', 'Korean-speaking', 'swag', 'knowing', 'original', 'title', '2009', 'movie', 'Chilgeup', 'gongmuwon', 'western', 'audiences', 'title', '7th', 'Grade', 'Civil', 'Servant', 'Girlfriend', 'Agent', 'pick', 'preference', 'Chilgeup', 'gongmuwon', 'made', 'huge', 'impression', 'Korean', 'box', 'office', 'never', 'mind', 'was', 'only', '3', '5', 'stars', 'flick', 'hit', 'miss', 'more', 'hit', 'miss.As', 'always', 'foreign-language', 'cinema', 'recommend', 'watch', 'original', 'language', 'playing', 'read', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'rare', ""'m"", 'down', 'English', 'dubbing', 'one', 'lift', 'page', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'also', 'whiff', 'True', 'Lies', 'Anh', 'Soo', 'Ji', 'Ha-Neul', 'Kang', 'savvy', 'covert', 'operative', 'who', 'keep', 'lying', 'boyfriend', 'maintain', 'cover', 'poor', 'sap', 'Lee', 'Jaejung', 'Ji-Hwan', 'Kang', 'finally', 'fed', 'up', 'Anh', 'Soo', 'Ji', 'falsehoods', 'amscrays', 'Canada', 'study', 'international', 'accounting', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'heart', 'broke.Three', 'years', 'go', 'ex-lovers', 'bump', 'other', 'men', 'restroom', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'Festering', 'emotions', 'boil', 'huge', 'row', 'think', 'then', 'keep', 'running', 'other', 'Anh', 'Soo', 'Ji', 'still', 'persisting', 'pretense', 'here', 'shift', 'relationship', 'Lee', 'Jaejung', 'now', 'fledgling', 'spy', 'espionage', 'agency', 'So', 'now', ""'re"", 'pushing', 'masquerade.The', 'film', 'McGuffin', 'deadly', 'weaponized', 'chemical', 'agent', 'coveted', 'Russian', 'mob', 'What', 'are', 'odds', 'characters', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'Odds', 'are', 'good', '2009', 'Chilgeup', 'gongmuwon', 'was', 'popular', 'enough', 'inspired', 'television', 'series', '2013', 'thought', 'lead', 'actors', 'were', 'fine', 'generate', 'good', 'spark', 'Ji-Hwan', 'Kang', 'more', 'delicate', 'balance', 'portrayed', 'more', 'comic', 'two', 'roles', 'Ha-Neul', 'Kang', 'more', 'standard', 'play-it-straight', 'part', 'Ji-Hwan', 'Kang', 'times', 'will', 'remind', 'anime', 'manga', 'character', 'got', 'tendency', 'shriek', 'girly', 'high', 'pitch', 'jeopardy', 'Where', 'ex', 'experienced', 'secret', 'agent', 'Ji-Hwan', 'Kang', 'rookie', 'spy', 'bit', 'goof-up', 'who', 'often', 'berated', 'immediate', 'superior', 'undercover', 'scenes', 'make', 'pretty', 'um', 'curious', 'capers', 'grinned', 'quite', 'bit', 'poor', 'sap', 'was', 'endearing', 'even', 'did', 'get', 'frustrated', 'how', 'bumbling', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'cracked', 'up', 'had', 'have', 'different', 'password', 'computer', 'file', 'sure', 'drove', 'immediate', 'superior', 'batty.So', 'would', 'say', 'Chilgeup', 'gongmuwon', 'comedy', 'bits', 'less', 'successful', 'action', 'bits', 'Several', 'stunts', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'choreographed', 'better', 'silly', 'fencing', 'jet', 'ski', 'sequences', 'script', 'scattershot', 'Thankfully', 'enough', 'what', 'solid', 'interactions', 'two', 'leads', 'could', 'put', 'up', 'nonsense', 'portions', 'film']",My Girlfriend Is an Agent (Standard Edition) DVD
