That said, I found the Clerks animated series to be boring. The stories were slow and repetitive. The jokes were sophmoric and tedious compared to his usually intelligent humor. I just couldn't get into it. I know what you're thinking, &quot;Jay and Silent Bob? Intelligent humor?!&quot; Ok, so maybe intelligent isn't the word, but it's humor for intelligent people. Compare and contrast with, for example, Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler. Still often VERY funny, but it doesn't take a much wit to get the jokes.

Only two episodes aired on ABC, and only six were made. This dvd contains all six, with (not so good) introductions by Jay and Silent Bob. The cartoon has a sharp look to it, and a few good lines. Episodes 3,4, and 5 are the best, and actually are pretty good. Episode 1 and 2 are bad. The final episode is ok, but not like 3,4,and 5. Those three episodes show that the series could have improved had ABC kept it.Once again Kevin Smith has a good dvd. There are animatics for each episode and two featurettes. Producers Kevin Smith, Scott Mosier, and Dave Mandel, Supervising Director Chris Bailey, and actors Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, and Jason Mewes supply the commentry that runs through all six episodes. Smith says at one point that these cartoons are best watched with an audience of 5000 (referring to his showings at comic book collections), and I can see what he means. These cartoons were so much more enjoyable watching it during the commentary. It is like watching it with them.This isn't The Simpsons or South Park.

And lost in the midst of it all was this treasure. Clerks, the failed animated series based on the Kevin Smith film of the same name, lasted a mere two episodes on the ABC network before having it's plug pulled. But alas, they had more than just two episodes, there were six all together, and all six of them are right here, uncensored, on DVD, for your viewing pleasure. A lot of Smith fans questioned if the transition from an R-rated ""potty humor"" movie to a nationally syndicated primetime animated series was logical, or even funny. Well, rest assured, it is. The witty writing, the clever pop-culture references, the odd usage of celebrities, it's all here. No Kevin Smith fan will be disappointed. The animation on the series is flawless and all 6 episodes are hilarious and diverse. If this show had been given it's fair chance, we'd still be watching it today. All 6 episodes come with commentary by Smith and friends, where towards the end, Smith vents about his distatse for a certain thin-mustached lawyer. We are also given a few animatics (animated storyboards) and some little ""making-of"" featurettes.

This beautiful two-disc collection will give you everything your dreaming heart desires and more!  Director Kevin Smith held back nothing to get this series going and sadly, as most GREAT series do, it was canceled after only two episodes.  What you need to realize is that this show had more humor in it than anything on television today.  It could have easily surpassed the Simpsons with the direction that Smith was taking it.  Continual film references, Star Wars moments, and even parodies only enhanced this series to a whole new level.  What made this short lived series even better is that we were already familiar with the characters and the setting, the only new parts were the stories and, my favorite, Leonardo Leonardo.  I can't believe they had Alec Baldwin do the voice.  He was hysterical.Some of my favorite scenes are:1) the McDonalds characters as town figureheads2) Judge Reinhold and the banana scenes3) Japanese animation4) Yipes, just yipes5) Sexy Randal The Pharaoh Wizard6) The flashback episode (clip episode #2)7) IKEA and Leonardo Leonardo8) Everything else in between!The only aspect of this series that I did not like was how the DVD used Jay and Silent Bob (the live characters) to introduce the next episode.  I could have used without them.  Nonetheless, this was imaginative, creative, and a perfect extension of the film masterpiece.

Dante and Randall play off of each other's words and thoughts brilliantly, much like the movie. The characters in the film are very animated to begin with, so making a cartoon series from it's basis makes sense, along with a lot of laughs. They tackle much of the same type of topics as they do in ""Clerks"", pushing the jokes much further in comparison, creating original and unique ideas untouched by your basic adult cartoons.Fans of ""Clerks"" will find these 6 cartoons very entertaining. The same actors are used as voices, and they did an excellent job of matching up the animations with each characters personality. These cartoons move very fast, rattling jokes off, one after another, much like other comparable adult cartoons.It's just too bad they stopped after 6 episodes. If they continued making them, ""Simpsons"", ""South Park"", and ""Family Guy"" would have some stiff competition on their hands.

566514,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0000541WH,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[2, 2]","I remeber when this show premiered four years ago on ABC.  There was a good amount of hype, so I decided to check it out.  At that time, I wasn't old enough to understand and/or appreciate many of the plotlines, paradies, and jokes.  Also, the show only lasted two episodes, so I didn't really get into this show until I saw the movie Clerks a few days ago (I am going to review the 10th Anniversary edition in September).  The movie was hilarious, and so I decided to check out the series.  Make no mistake, the series is also funny, but it's funny for different reasons.  Obviously, Kevin Smith couldn't get away with the things he could in the film, such as the profanity.  However, in the series, he could do a lot more with visuals.  Afterall, the show is animated, and the movie was made for less than $30,000.The show follows the exploits of Quick-Stop clerk Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran), RST Video clerk Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), and uber-slackers, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith).  They quartet always seems to get into some weird situation, like when they got trapped in the freezer in the second episode and started to reminice about their lives.  Or there was the time when the end of an episode was ""lost"" and was replaced with an anime style ending.As I said, the show is very funny, but it did lack two things from the movie that they could have done in the show.  One of them was customer interaction.  The clerks rarely had to deal with customers, and those moments were some of the funniest in the films.  Also in the film, there were some random conversations from time to time about almost nothing.  They didn't have enough of those in the series.I must say, I am surprised this show only lasted two episodes.  I thought it was very funny, and even if the show was doomed, how does one tell something like that after only two episodes?!  Furthermore, someone thought that the DVD's would sell, so I am really confused.  Well, if you are a Kevin Smith fan, you should consider checking this out.Snootch to the nooch.",4,It's A Tragedy This Comedy Was Cancelled,1093392000,"08 25, 2004",2004,2051,"['remeber', 'when', 'show', 'premiered', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'ABC', 'was', 'good', 'amount', 'hype', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'old', 'enough', 'understand', 'and/or', 'appreciate', 'many', 'plotlines', 'paradies', 'jokes', 'Also', 'show', 'only', 'lasted', 'two', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'show', 'saw', 'movie', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'am', 'going', 'review', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'edition', 'September', 'movie', 'was', 'hilarious', 'so', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'series', 'Make', 'mistake', 'series', 'also', 'funny', 'funny', 'different', 'reasons', 'Obviously', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'things', 'could', 'film', 'such', 'profanity', 'However', 'series', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'more', 'visuals', 'Afterall', 'show', 'animated', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'less', '30,000.The', 'show', 'exploits', 'Quick-Stop', 'clerk', 'Dante', 'Hicks', 'Brian', ""O'Halloran"", 'RST', 'Video', 'clerk', 'Randal', 'Graves', 'Jeff', 'Anderson', 'uber-slackers', 'Jay', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'Smith', 'quartet', 'always', 'get', 'weird', 'situation', 'when', 'got', 'trapped', 'freezer', 'second', 'episode', 'started', 'reminice', 'lives', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'end', 'episode', 'was', 'lost', 'was', 'replaced', 'anime', 'style', 'ending.As', 'said', 'show', 'very', 'funny', 'did', 'lack', 'two', 'things', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'show', 'One', 'was', 'customer', 'interaction', 'clerks', 'rarely', 'had', 'deal', 'customers', 'moments', 'were', 'funniest', 'films', 'Also', 'film', 'were', 'random', 'conversations', 'time', 'time', 'almost', 'nothing', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'series.I', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'surprised', 'show', 'only', 'lasted', 'two', 'episodes', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'even', 'show', 'was', 'doomed', 'how', 'one', 'tell', 'something', 'only', 'two', 'episodes', 'Furthermore', 'someone', 'thought', 'DVD', 'would', 'sell', 'am', 'really', 'confused', 'Well', 'are', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'fan', 'should', 'consider', 'checking', 'out.Snootch', 'nooch']",N/A

The funniest moment is the last half of episode 4: it's a total spoof of Pokemon, and I was on the ground laughing.

Canceled after only two episodes, Kevin Smith's animated take on his cult-film CLERKS is fabulously twisted and extremely off-the-wall in a way that makes even the most wild Simpsons episodes seem tame. That's not to say it's ground-breaking in any way. If you've seen the movie, you will be well-prepared (and a little disappointed) for the show. Gone are the highly profane conversations and in their place are some truly inspired riffs on pop culture (at least two dozen movies are poked and prodded and satirized in the 6 episodes contained on the discs). The principle characters are all here: Dante, Randal, Jay, Silent Bob - even Steve-Dave and Walt - and they are all voiced by the same people who played them in the film. Some major celebrity talent lends some support as well, with Alec Baldwin, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Charles Barkley (in the most hilarious cameos ever filmed, er, drawn... watch for his appearence next to Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker in episode  5, it's great!).  But what's truly great about this series is the amount of love and care that went into this DVD set. Each episode contains commentary by Smith, series producers Scott Mosier and Dave Mandel, Brian O'Halloran (Dante), Jeff Anderson (Randal), Jason Mewes (Jay), and supervising director Chris Bailey. Listening to them discuss everything from animation styles to behind-the-scenes politics and dealings with CBS lawyers is awesome and often pretty hilarious. I didn't think anyone would have ever thought about adding commentary tracks to stuff like this but I'm really glad they did. Also you get some great production material, detailing character design specifics which might seem boring but is really quite outstanding viewing for any die-hard CLERKS fan (some of the conceptual artwork is gut-busting all by itself). So if you've never seen the show before but like the movie, this is a great purchase. Heck, even if you've never seen the movie but are fans of Kevin Smith films this is a great purchase.

What is the best thing about this six episode, double-disc set is hard to say. It might be because all four leads from the original film voice the show: Brian O'Halloran &amp; Jeff Anderson as Dante &amp; Randall with Jason Mewes and Clerks creator/overlord Kevin Smith as Jay And Silent Bob (though as usual, Kevin is &quot;Rarely Heard, Often Seen&quot;.) Or it could be that these six great shows that they made, only two of them ever actually made it to air! It could be even that the animation is actually pretty top-notch, unlike the countless animated drivel that was on the other networks at the time. I guess it's too bad that there's only these six, it would of being great if the show had more, but the ownership of them is well worth it &amp; it comes with many great DVD extras too. The commentary is once again hilarious, with the &quot;slacker-four&quot; and their producers and director. It's actually a very enlightning &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; roundtable-like discussion of what to do and not to do when making a cartoon and working with a network at the same time. Also, the DVD comes with two featurettes, two trailers (featuring the Smith beloved &quot;Super Bowl&quot; spot), rough animatics of it's character development, and pretty cool menus to boot.

Everyone that appears in the movie reprises their roles in ""Clerks"" the Animated Series"". Even though it is only six episodes, they are still as brilliant as Kevin Smith's movies. There a lot of jokes in every single episode. Another cool thing about it is that each episode is introduced by the real Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) which only adds to the enjoyment of this DVD. The extras are very much worth getting as well, from commercials to the evolution of the animation, they are all great. This is a DVD that you can't miss if you are a fan.

I saw both of the origianlly aired episodes, and was sorely dissapointed when the show was cancelled. To me this DVD collection is a Godsend, not only all of the episodes(in order!), intros to each episode with Jay and Silent Bob(I think everyone agrees the intro to episode two is the funniest of the six), background info on character creation and story development, but best of all(apart from the cartoons themselves) Kevin Smith and crew doing what they do best: Audio Commentary! Anyone who's bought Kevin's DVDs(or laser discs) will know what a treat his commentaries are. Sometimes outshining the movie they're commenting on. Definatley worth the price of addmission on its own.  Well about the actual episodes themselves: 1) Somewhat typical first episode fare, establishes the main characters of Dante, Randal, Jay and Silent Bob, and Leonardo Leonardo, as well as the adversarial relation ship between the Clerks and Leonardo Leonardo. It also makes it quite clear that this is NOT the Clerks movie in animated form, but an honest to goodness effort at a new cartoon. 2) Hillarious take on all of the sitcoms that ever used the 'locked in the freezer' premise, and 'flashback to use old clips to fill time' dodge of cartoons as well as sitcoms, just made all the funier by the fact they only had one episode to 'flashback' to.3) two words: James Woods. 4) An amalgamation of courtroom drama and Anime. &quot;Who is driving?&quot; &quot;Oh no! Bear is driving! How can that be?!&quot; 5) One of the strongest episodes story wise combines 'The Bad News Bears' with 'Temple of Doom' and a little 'Last Starfighter' thrown in for good measure. Meeting Randal's old girlfriends at his ten year highschool reunion has got to be one of the funniest moments in the cartoon. Both Randal and Dante's characters really begin to develop, and move beyond their movie counterparts. 6) Going 'OldSchool Clerks' this episode was created to answer the unavoidable backlash Kevin and company knew would come from die-hard Clerks fans. The main part of the episode deals with the Clerks staying inside the store, as incredibly exciting things that we never see, but only hear about, are occuring outside. Very funny, with refernces to 'THe MaTRiX' and Bug's Bunny Cartoons.With voices by the original Clerks stars, and an interesting list of bigger names, such as the afore mentioned James Woods, Alec Baldwin(as Leonardo Leonardo) and Gweneth Paltrow, the vocal talent really adds to the show. The style of the animation really fits as well, psuedo comic bookish but not saturday morning stiff.Excelent all the way around, and made for multiple viewings, a lot slips by the first time. And as you get to know the characters like Kevin Smith does, more of their motivations become clear.

In some ways, these changes are for the better. In other ways, these changes can be quite annoying or they may not even effect you one bit. I actually watched the &quot;Clerks Uncensored&quot; two-disc DVD set before I even watched the Clerks movie, so I didn't even notice these changes. Anyway, as I've mentioned before in my Clerks the movie review, I just didn't find it to be very funny. The show, on the other hand, was filled with moments that were simply hilarious.I loved each episode of it and I curse ABC for canceling it after only two episodes. ABC is really the reason why some people didn't like the show. ABC forced the creators to change just about everything that made Clerks what it was. For instance, in the Kevin Smith movies, Jay &amp; Silent Bob are drug dealers, whilst in the show, they are firecracker salesman. Jay &amp; Silent Bob are still pretty funny, but it's weird to see them put in such a ridiculous means of employment.Overall, I seem to like the show of Clerks better than the movie itself and enjoyed how Charles Barkley was almost in every episode.

I groaned and set it aside, since I'd seen one episode which had aired on ABC and had found it dull and inane.Some time later, I tried to sit through the first episode on my own, and failed.  Clerks was shelved once again.  However, by chance, I went to the Clerks-cartoon website and watched a pretty funny outtake.  So I suffered through the first episode (which is simply necessary exposition), and once I was on to the second episode (a FLASHBACK EPISODE), I was rolling.  By the third episode, which is golden if only for an unlikely celebrity impersonation, I was crying for joy.  I brought along the DVD to the home of the gents who previously had hosted a Back to the Future Trilogy party, and we all absolutely hit the floor.What makes this cartoon work is exceptional art with stylized line weights, ordinarily-wooden actors doing brilliantly natural voiceover dialogue, excellent guest stars (Alec Baldwin, Gilbert Gottfried -ironically-, James Woods, Gwyneth Paltrow, Charles Barkley, and other all-star basketball players).

Any kind of sequel (like the series) would NEED to be a lot different in order to be good.That said, the show is incredibly funny, but is - at times - stupid. [....] Anyway, the good gags make up for it, so there's no real complaints.There are three parts to the series. In the first part, episodes 1 and 2, you see the series taking baby steps and beginning to evolve. It's funny, but with some flaws. In the middle part, episodes 3 and 4, you see that the animation is a lot smoother, and things seem to be working better. There are much less flaws, and it is a lot funnier. When you get to the final two episodes, you clearly see that everything is moving faster and without any problems, and the episodes are - guess which word I'll use - flawless.The commentary is great, and is both very funny and informative. It teaches you what to do and what not to do if you ever plan on making a TV show. The documentaries are interesting (Not funny, but hey, they're documentaries), but a little bit too short. One is only about three minutes, the other one is about eleven minutes. The Film Festival Trailer is hilarious, particularly because of the fake critic reviews. So, the extras on the DVD do not disappoint.Great music, great animation, great acting, good plot ideas. Why did it fail?

Canceled after only two episodes, the remaining four would be relegated to this DVD set and on again off again showings on Adult Swim.Despite being much cleaner than its movie counterparts, which isn't the curse one think it be, the characters in Clerks still manage to channel the synergy you'd expect despite all the necessary trappings that come with an animated series. New, purposely stock characters like Leonardo Leonardo become the butt of numerous jokes - as does the entire show itself. This marks the defining element of Clerks as a cartoon; the people behind its creation almost seem to know it's destined to fail. Failure, and fun within it has always been a central theme in Clerks and the writers capitalize on this, each episode standing on it's own and written like it's the last. In fact, the last episode is entitled ""The Last Episode Ever.""Fun as the experience and disrespecting Charles Barkley can be, I can't exactly give Clerks a five out five. While there isn't any glaring error I can use to specify why I can't give it a ringing endorsement, there's an intangible factor that keeps it from being a slam dunk of the cult classic variety. Additionally, while I'm not particularly offended by anything presented here, I could see how some could take offense to the smorgasbord of jokes aimed at being of the other persuasion. I know that's typical Clerks humor and all but it's almost overdone at certain points.Regardless of the fate TV handed it, the animated version of Clerks did what it could with what it was given.

566547,ASR84M1GD9X89,B0000541WH,Kimberly Murphy-Smith,"[8, 25]","I may be the wrong audience for CLERKS: THE ANIMATED SERIES.  My husband is a huge Kevin Smith fan and absolutely loves this series, and urged me to see it.  I'm not a Kevin Smith fan and the only movie by him that I've ever seen is DOGMA, which I thought was funny and reasonably entertaining but not great by any means.  But because I love my husband and because I heard Alec Baldwin provided one of the voices (and for Baldwin I'll sit through almost anything once), I sat down to watch it.Or, at least, I TRIED to watch it.This isn't the worst thing I've ever seen on DVD, but it's pretty close.  In the four episodes I was able to get through in their entirety, I smiled a half-dozen times and laughed out loud only once.  I could not even make it through the last two, they were so bad.  Smith's guidelines for writing this series appear to be &quot;Anything Is Funny If You Repeat It Enough Times&quot; and &quot;Even Stupid Pop Culture References Are Cool&quot;.  The series starts out promising--the first episode has its share of moments where the repetition and the pop stuff ALMOST works, and the voice actors, including many original cast members (and of course, Alec Baldwin, who completely outshines his material) do their darndest to make the dialogue sound funnier than it is--but the second episode rapidly degenerates into self-referential smugness, and even the one laugh-out-loud moment in the third episode is immediately swallowed up by needless gay-bashing and running its one funny joke into the ground.  By the end of the fourth episode I realized I hadn't laughed in a long while, and by the time the fifth episode told the series' millionth is-somebody-gay joke, I hit the eject button.  I made myself watch the opening sequence of the sixth episode (in which Dante and Randall are asked by geek CLERKS fans, &quot;How little did you sell out for?&quot;) and was just starting to think I might have been too hasty when the Kewl Reference Machine kicked in again full force and I once more turned it off in disgust.I'm not sure what either ABC or Kevin Smith thought they were getting into when they agreed to do this series, but it's clear from the final result that neither got what they wanted; ABC cancelled it after only two airings, and Smith excoriated ABC on his web site and on the DVD's commentary track.  It isn't just that it's not funny, it's that it's not even interesting.  See Kevin lampoon Canada.  See Kevin lampoon gays.  See Kevin lampoon his own misogyny and homogeny.  See Kevin lampoon sitcom plot devices.  See Kevin lampoon popular movies.  See Kevin lampoon himself for &quot;selling out&quot;.  See exasperated reviewer turn off the DVD.If you're a Kevin Smith fan, by all means give CLERKS: THE ANIMATED SERIES a try; you'll probably get a lot more out of it than I did.

Follow Dante and Randal into even more obscure adventures than what takes place in the actual film. Be advised there are only six episodes. Only two were ever aired on television. As far as I know there will not be any more. That's not very fair since this cartoon is on par with all of the hit comedies out there like Family Guy, Futurama and The Simpsons. If you're a huge Kevin Smith or Jay and Silent Bob fan, then you should definitely consider picking this up and owning it. It's also got low price tag, so that's a plus (I mean it's only six episodes). Here's a quick run-down of the episodes :1) ""Nothing Exciting Ever Happens"" - Business at the Quick Stop is threatened when billionare Leonardo Leonardo opens a quicker stop. Dante and Randal have to stop it.2) ""Trapped"" - Dante and Randal get trapped in a freezer at the Quick Stop and remember old times together.3) ""Discreeto Burriots"" - Leonardo Leonardo gets a very bad stomach virus and the Quick stop is investigated for foul play.4) ""Take The Case"" - Jay trys to sue Dante and Randal.5) ""Class Reunion"" - Dante becomes the coach of Leonardo's little league team6) ""The Fair Across the Street"" - well isn't really about anything.So like I said if you like Jay and Silent Bob, Clerks, Kevin Smith, or anything related to those three things, you need to buy this DVD set. It's very cheap and shows some very entertaining episodes of what would have been a great tv show, had it been given a better chance.

Meanwhile, Jay and Silent Bob sell M-80s.Episode 2 (A): When Dante installs new locks on the Quick Stop, he and Randal become stuck in small places. Time for cool flashbacks.Episode 3 (B+): When a new pet store opens up on the Quick Stop's block, Randal starts going nuts over Outbreak. Meanwhile, Jay and Silent Bob train a pet monkey.Episode 4 (A-): Jay slips on some soda at the Quick Stop and sues Dante for 10 million dollars. Also, special Japanimation ending!Episode 5 (B+): Dante gets a chance to coach LL's little league team while Randal become an egyptian slave. Also, Jay gets to play on the team.Episode 6 (A): Dante and Randal must stay up all night while across the street a fair goes on. Jay and Silent Bob act as Dante and Randals eyes to the fair.

The reviewer also goes on to mention how it's little retribution for being made to watch this junk.And the reviewer would be absolutely CORRECT.My brother got this DVD-set for his birthday and I looked forward to seeing it because at the time, it was constantly rented out at the video store. When he surprised me with it, I immediately popped it in and was ready and waiting to laugh...I'm still ready and waiting. This is the FIRST Smith work that I actually SHUT OFF in the middle just because I thought it sucked.Don't get me wrong, the animation is great. I got a small preview when I read the Clerks comics, a showcase of witty writing and wonderful art...the show has the latter and ONLY the latter.The two discs contain six episodes:1) Some guy named Leonardo Leonardo comes into town and decides to go on a mission to take over the Quickee Stop market. Honestly, who cares? References to BATMAN and the overcommercialization of Starbucks Coffee(a theme DONE TO DEATH) and Way over-played. Oh, there's a bunch of gay-references. Also, Randall says that the show is &quot;taped before a live studio-audience&quot;. I know that's untrue, but after the first episode, I actually BELIEVED it. Why? NOBODY WAS LAUGHING. The beginning of the episode is hysterical. Too bad the series couldn't be more LIKE THAT. 2) Dante and Randall get trapped in a freezer and then talk about old times. This doesn't even come CLOSE to working. This parodies old sitcoms. Oh...gay-references are here as well. Dante's need to &quot;make more Star Wars references&quot; to stay warm is a quick indication of the lack of ANY creativity on the show. 3) A repeat of OUTBREAK. Only this time, it's supposed to be funny. And Patrick Swayze runs the pet shop across the way. Oh yeah, and he sounds like Gibert Godfreid. Oh, and James Woods is the main scientist. Oh, and there's some gay-references. 4) Randall as a lawyer in a lawsuit. Count how many pop-cult references fall in here and you'll win a toaster-oven and a life-time supply of Turtle Wax. And what's with the recurring theme with BASKETBALL? I thought Kevin Smith's favorite sport was HOCKEY!!! And I'm sorry to disagree with some of you. The Japanimation part is WAY too random and an excuse to cover up for lack of an actual ENDING. It's also VERY unfunny. Smith seems five years late for the prom thanks to South Park already COVERING Japanimation in the episode called, &quot;CHINPOKOMON&quot;. 5) A completely RANDOM episode that rips off INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, THE BAD NEWS BEARS, STAR WARS...oh, Leonardo denies doing anything with Dante during a drunken stupor. Gay joke number 43,255. 6) The self-titled &quot;Very Last Episode&quot;. It works UNTIL they go into &quot;The Matrix&quot;. You would think the writers learned after five dumb episodes. After THE MATRIX, we're treated(if you can call it that; I call it &quot;subjected to&quot;) to five minutes of RANDOMNESS. You know, I like randomness, but this isn't GOOD random. It's BAD random...and the FINAL set of gay references. Oh, and it's Soccer this time that gets the spotlight.Hard to believe that Batman Animated Series writer Paul Dini was part of this.Oh, the sets with Jay and Silent Bob are unneccessary. Especially when Jay goes on a swearing rant just because he thinks the audience won't be impressed with a cuss-free show. Come on, Kevin. You're BETTER than this. By the way, if Disney screwed you on DOGMA, WHY would you go back and make your series with them? Are you ASKING for a beating?People who compare this to the Simpsons, South Park, or even THE CRITIC need to have their heads examined. All three of those shows are sharp, witty, original, tell a straight story, and don't rely HEAVILY on other shows/comics/movies/books/random media to get through an episode...I beg ANY network to proceed with caution if they so decide to pick this series up. You'll be lowering your ratings and allowing THE SIMPSONS to stomp a mudhole in you.Rest in Peace, CLERKS.",1,Done to Death,989366400,"05 9, 2001",2001,4155,"['One', 'reviewer', 'made', 'reference', 'show', 'quot', 'Final', 'Episode', 'quot', 'where', 'character', 'ComicCon', 'Dante', 'Randall', 'how', 'little', 'sold', 'out', 'reviewer', 'also', 'mention', 'how', 'little', 'retribution', 'being', 'made', 'watch', 'junk.And', 'reviewer', 'would', 'be', 'absolutely', 'CORRECT.My', 'brother', 'got', 'DVD-set', 'birthday', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'time', 'was', 'constantly', 'rented', 'out', 'video', 'store', 'When', 'surprised', 'immediately', 'popped', 'was', 'ready', 'waiting', ""'m"", 'still', 'ready', 'waiting', 'FIRST', 'Smith', 'work', 'actually', 'SHUT', 'OFF', 'middle', 'just', 'thought', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'animation', 'great', 'got', 'small', 'preview', 'when', 'read', 'Clerks', 'comics', 'showcase', 'witty', 'writing', 'wonderful', 'art', 'show', 'latter', 'ONLY', 'latter.The', 'two', 'discs', 'contain', 'six', 'episodes:1', 'guy', 'named', 'Leonardo', 'Leonardo', 'town', 'decides', 'go', 'mission', 'take', 'over', 'Quickee', 'Stop', 'market', 'Honestly', 'who', 'References', 'BATMAN', 'overcommercialization', 'Starbucks', 'Coffee', 'theme', 'DONE', 'TO', 'DEATH', 'Way', 'over-played', 'Oh', 'bunch', 'gay-references', 'Also', 'Randall', 'show', 'quot', 'taped', 'live', 'studio-audience', 'quot', 'know', 'untrue', 'first', 'episode', 'actually', 'BELIEVED', 'Why', 'NOBODY', 'WAS', 'LAUGHING', 'beginning', 'episode', 'hysterical', 'Too', 'bad', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'THAT', '2', 'Dante', 'Randall', 'get', 'trapped', 'freezer', 'then', 'talk', 'old', 'times', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'CLOSE', 'working', 'old', 'sitcoms', 'Oh', 'gay-references', 'are', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Dante', 'need', 'quot', 'make', 'more', 'Star', 'Wars', 'quot', 'stay', 'warm', 'quick', 'indication', 'lack', 'ANY', 'creativity', 'show', '3', 'repeat', 'OUTBREAK', 'Only', 'time', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'pet', 'shop', 'way', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Gibert', 'Godfreid', 'Oh', 'James', 'Woods', 'main', 'scientist', 'Oh', 'gay-references', '4', 'Randall', 'lawyer', 'lawsuit', 'Count', 'how', 'many', 'pop-cult', 'references', 'fall', 'here', ""'ll"", 'win', 'toaster-oven', 'life-time', 'supply', 'Turtle', 'Wax', 'what', 'recurring', 'theme', 'BASKETBALL', 'thought', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'favorite', 'sport', 'was', 'HOCKEY', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'disagree', 'Japanimation', 'part', 'WAY', 'too', 'random', 'excuse', 'cover', 'up', 'lack', 'actual', 'ENDING', 'also', 'VERY', 'unfunny', 'Smith', 'five', 'years', 'late', 'prom', 'thanks', 'South', 'Park', 'already', 'COVERING', 'Japanimation', 'episode', 'called', 'quot', 'CHINPOKOMON', 'quot', '5', 'completely', 'RANDOM', 'episode', 'INDIANA', 'JONES', 'AND', 'THE', 'TEMPLE', 'OF', 'DOOM', 'THE', 'BAD', 'NEWS', 'BEARS', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'oh', 'Leonardo', 'doing', 'anything', 'Dante', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'Gay', 'joke', 'number', '43,255', '6', 'self-titled', 'quot', 'Very', 'Last', 'Episode', 'quot', 'UNTIL', 'go', 'quot', 'Matrix', 'quot', 'would', 'think', 'writers', 'learned', 'five', 'dumb', 'episodes', 'MATRIX', ""'re"", 'treated', 'can', 'call', 'call', 'quot', 'subjected', 'quot', 'five', 'minutes', 'RANDOMNESS', 'know', 'like', 'randomness', ""n't"", 'GOOD', 'random', 'BAD', 'random', 'FINAL', 'set', 'gay', 'references', 'Oh', 'Soccer', 'time', 'spotlight.Hard', 'believe', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'writer', 'Paul', 'Dini', 'was', 'part', 'this.Oh', 'sets', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'are', 'unneccessary', 'Especially', 'when', 'Jay', 'swearing', 'rant', 'just', 'audience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'impressed', 'cuss-free', 'show', 'Come', 'Kevin', ""'re"", 'BETTER', 'way', 'Disney', 'screwed', 'DOGMA', 'WHY', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'make', 'series', 'Are', 'ASKING', 'beating', 'People', 'who', 'compare', 'Simpsons', 'South', 'Park', 'even', 'THE', 'CRITIC', 'need', 'have', 'heads', 'examined', 'three', 'shows', 'are', 'sharp', 'witty', 'original', 'tell', 'straight', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'rely', 'HEAVILY', 'other', 'shows/comics/movies/books/random', 'media', 'get', 'episode', 'beg', 'network', 'proceed', 'caution', 'so', 'decide', 'pick', 'series', 'up', ""'ll"", 'be', 'lowering', 'ratings', 'allowing', 'THE', 'SIMPSONS', 'stomp', 'mudhole', 'you.Rest', 'Peace', 'CLERKS']",N/A

The animated series, ""Clerks,"" only made it for two episodes from what I know.  It's hard to understand why, because I thought they were hilarious.  Sure, they were nothing like the movie, but they were still good and entertaining.  Well, now here's your chance to see those two episodes, and four others that have never been seen before.  ""Clerks: Uncensored"" is animated chaos and mayhem at its best.Written by Kevin Smith and voiced by the major players from the movie, you still get to see all the great wit and humor from Smith's mind, even if he can't use cursing.  The episodes are very well executed and well written, leaving you unsure of what to expect next.All 6 episodes are great, but I must say that one of my favorites has to be the one that resembles the movie, ""Outbreak.""  (Remember, due to legal reasons, it can no longer be referred to as the Dustin Hoffman movie when you are talking about the show.  It must now be referred to as the Al Pacino movie.)  All of the rest are great too.All of this is presented to you on 2 disks, including extras such as intros to each episode by Jay and Silent Bob, commentary, character development featurette, the film festival trailer, and a couple of other nice extras to make you happy.You like Kevin Smith?  You like ""Clerks?""  Then pick up this DVD.  While it may not be as good as the movie (it's not trying to be, and it even makes fun of the fact that it isn't), ""Clerks: Uncensored"" is hilarious and entertaining.  Forget ABC!

566554,A3L46ZRKNFN0SG,B0000541WH,Michael W. Howe,"[20, 21]","First of all, I've never been a huge fan of Kevin Smith.  I did enjoy Mallrats, and viewed Dogma, as well as Clerks, and found them interesting, but nothing that I would really get into.  When word hit of an animated series, the shows were put on the air for two episodes, before ABC television decided to cancel the series.  After this, KEvin SMith and his creative team decided to get their version of revenge, and released this DVD set, featuring all six episodes.  Yes, ALL SIX EPISODES!  What's great is that the series had some funny yet creative parodies, everything from Japanese animation, Star Wars, The Matrix, Indiana Jones, The Last Starfighter, the original Batman TV series, and much more.The basic premise of the series revolves around Dante Hicks, the down-on-his-luck clerk at the local &quot;Quickstop&quot; convenience store, and his annoying and troublesome chum Randal Graves, who usually succeeds in getting Dante into more trouble than he needs.  Along for the ride are the fast-talking Jay, and his long-time companion Silent Bob.The episodes are as follows: Episode 1:  This TV pilot episodes was never shown, because the people who saw it were Hollywood suits who did not get it.  The plot basically stems around the fact that in the city where Clerks is based (LEonardo, New Jersey), the town founder's relation Leonardo Leonardo, has returned to stay, and plans to open a new convenience store (Quickerstop), which could pose a risk for Dante and Randal.Episode 2: After getting locked in the storage freezer at the &quot;Quickstop,&quot; Dante and Randla begin to reminesce about their past adventures (which doesn't amount to much considering it's only their second show, but it is still funny!).Episode 3: After a new pet store opens nearby run by Patrick Swayze (though voiced by Gilbert Gottfried), Randal gets the idea that a monkey in the store has infected the entire area with a virus, just like the movie &quot;Outbreak.&quot;  His idiotic overreaction causes the government to quarentine the Quickstop, and call for the extermination of the town to keep the virus from spreading.  Side note: the voice of the leader of the government group is played by James Woods, great casting!Episode 4: One of only 2 episodes that aired on TV.  After Jay slips on some spilled orange soda in the &quot;Quickstop,&quot; Randal idiotically manages to coax Jay to sue Dante for $10 million dollars. It doesn't look good when the NBA all-stars take the jury, and Randal does nothing to help the case (how can calling George Lucas and Steven Spielberg as witnesses help?  Watch and see!).  The episode also has a surprise animation ending, that just gets funnier everytime you watch it!Episode 5: After Dante is berated by the fact that his high school baseball team does not remember that he was their team manager, Leonardo Leonardo gives Dante the chance to coach his little league team, and slowly, the team wins their way to glory!  Meanwhile, Randal finds an old video game from his past, and after beating it, is recruited for a secret government operation, but it's not what he thinks!Episode 6:  After hearing from fellow fans that the entire Clerks cartoon series seems nothign like the film, Dante pledges that the cartoon will be more like it's predecessor.  The entire episode then goes on to include everything from Matrix references and Chuck Jones cartoon jokes!Along with all this, the DVD also has commentary by the people involved (and crude language is used, A LOT!!), as well as storyboards for each episode.  The discs had me watching for several hours, and I still keep watching them!

566560,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B0000541WH,mrliteral,"[0, 0]","TV history is filled with the obituaries of series that were really good but died prematurely.  To me, one of the most apt examples is Police Squad that ran only six brilliant episodes before disappearing (although it was fortunately resurrected as a set of movies).  Another example would be Clerks, the fantastically funny animated follow-up to the movie.  It was canceled after a mere two episodes, but the collection Clerks - Uncensored includes all six episodes that were made.The four principal characters are the same ones as in the movie (and are voiced by the same actors).  The main character is Dante, the convenience store clerk who is intelligent and a nice guy, but also the eternal victim, condemned to life working at the Quik Stop, even on his days off.  He constantly bemoans his fate but has no ambition to change it.  His best friend and biggest oppressor is Randal, who works at the adjacent video store.  Randal is also a lifetime clerk, but he is not bothered by his career; he is perfectly comfortable doing nothing and treating other people like garbage.  Then there are Jay and Silent Bob; in the movies, they are drug dealers, but for network TV they were toned down to fun loving slackers.Taking full advantage of the animated medium, the episodes get both weird and funny in ways the movie (or live TV shows) could not be.  The first episode pits the Clerks against Leonard Leonard, an evil Montgomery Burns-like billionaire intent on taking over the world with an ultra-convoluted scheme.  By Episode 2, we already have a flashback episode when Dante and Randal are locked in the Quik Stop freezer and reminisce about old times.  Episode 3 puts the Quik Stop under quarantine after Leonard Leonard takes ill after a monkey bite; is it a dreaded virus or some bad burritos?Episode 4 has Dante on trial after Jay slips and falls in the store.  Randal defends him, an effort sure to doom Dante, although things resolve in a typically bizarre fashion.  Episode 5 is a cross of Bad News Bears and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (with a dash of the Last Starfighter).  The final episode has Dante and Randal stuck in the store while more and more strange things happen outside. This episode concludes with an homage to a classic Warner Brothers cartoon; if you don't recognize it, it will be mentioned in the commentary.The commentary is indeed an important part of the set as the principals provide plenty of humorous insights into the history of the show:  how it was made and why it died so quickly.  It is a classic case of the network ""suits"" acting on quick and erroneous judgments.

The episodes are shown in the order they are supposed to be in, so they don't confuse us with unseen footage.Aside from all the half-hour episodes, we get a bevy of extras.

We then get 2 featurettes, one covering how they wanted the same style of the Clerks movie in the tv show, and the other covering the development of the characters.  We also get a trailer and a TV spot, introductions to each episode by Jay and Silent Bob, animatics for each episode, and loads of DVD-ROM material.All-in-all, this is a great addition to the View Askew collector.

Riddle,"[2, 4]","I'm not a huge fan of Kevin Smith (I enjoyed &quot;Clerks&quot;, but not much else under his direction), but purchased this mainly because of my interest in the animation.  The visual style of the series and the animation are quite good, but the scripts fall a little flat.  There's not much of an attempt to really explore the characters fully so that the humor could flow naturally out of the situations.  Too much of the comedy depends on pop culture and self-referential material.  I get the feeling that Smith and company didn't put as much thought and development into the series as they could have.  ABC was right in cancelling the show -- most of the episodes play like an unsold pilot and just aren't quite there.  It's about on par with &quot;The Critic&quot;, in that sense, but, even in that show, there was more character development.Smith's intros to the episodes and commentary are annoying -- he needs to stop trying to be Kevin &quot;Slacker&quot; Smith the character and public persona and try growing up a bit.  The insights he could provide on development of the series, rather than the bathroom humor and ragging on ABC, would be appreciated.Would be a good set for anyone interested in learning more about animation and perhaps getting a few ideas on making highly stylized characters and backgrounds in their own work.",3,Animation Style is Interesting,983923200,"03 7, 2001",2001,1341,"[""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'enjoyed', 'quot', 'Clerks', 'quot', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'direction', 'purchased', 'mainly', 'interest', 'animation', 'visual', 'style', 'series', 'animation', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'scripts', 'fall', 'little', 'flat', 'not', 'much', 'attempt', 'really', 'explore', 'characters', 'fully', 'so', 'humor', 'could', 'flow', 'naturally', 'situations', 'Too', 'much', 'comedy', 'pop', 'culture', 'self-referential', 'material', 'get', 'feeling', 'Smith', 'company', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'development', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'ABC', 'was', 'right', 'cancelling', 'show', 'most', 'episodes', 'play', 'unsold', 'pilot', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'there', 'par', 'quot', 'Critic', 'quot', 'sense', 'even', 'show', 'was', 'more', 'character', 'development.Smith', 'intros', 'episodes', 'commentary', 'are', 'annoying', 'stop', 'trying', 'be', 'Kevin', 'quot', 'Slacker', 'quot', 'Smith', 'character', 'public', 'persona', 'try', 'growing', 'up', 'bit', 'insights', 'could', 'provide', 'development', 'series', 'rather', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'ragging', 'ABC', 'would', 'be', 'appreciated.Would', 'be', 'good', 'set', 'anyone', 'interested', 'learning', 'more', 'animation', 'perhaps', 'getting', 'few', 'ideas', 'making', 'highly', 'stylized', 'characters', 'backgrounds', 'own', 'work']",N/A

Sure, you can try to push the envelope on prime time, but what did they (both Smith's team and the audience) expect?I didn't think they would try to emulate the original &quot;Clerks&quot; movie formula, so the cartoon worked with a recurring cast of lesser characters. It won't satisfy purists, but then, what will? Dante and Randall's characters have evolved somewhat in the transition, but for the most part, its a change for the better.The animation was great with a canny knack of capturing an emotion, which doens't always happen on celluloid. Smith includes loads of in-jokes and cultural references, which keeps the faithful entertained, but those with only a passing familiarity with View Askew movies will be lost.The bonus material ranges from awesome to weak, but I have to wonder what they were thinking by including the same material on both discs?! They could have compressed the episodes onto one disc and used the second to include the extras. Anderson and O'Halloran do a great job, and seeing how Smith seems intent on only keeping Ben Afleck and Jason Lee in his movies, they deserve a second chance.I hate to give less than four stars for the episodes, but the final product pulls it down to three.

I've been a fan for some time, but sadly, I only owned ""Dogma"", ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"".  So I went on a hunt for the films missing from my collection.  I found ""Clerks - The Animated Series Uncensored"" used at an electronics store.  I knew I was in for something good as soon as I payed for it.  There were two guys at the counter.  One of them says hi and then took the DVD and looked it.  Suddenly his eyes widened.  ""Oh, man!  We had CLERKS?"" he said to his companion.  ""Yep,"" the other man replied.  ""When did this come in?"" he asked, running it through the scanner.  ""I dunno.""  With a final shake of his head, the man placed the DVD in a bag and said, ""I wish I'd known we had this.  I would've picked it up!""  I smiled and walked out of the store.  Oh, yeah.  I couldn't wait to watch these babies.In late May 2000, ""Clerks: The Animated Series"" made its debut on ABC-TV.  The show continues the wacky adventures of Quick Stop clerks Dante and Randal and the two stoners who hang out outside the store: Jay and Silent Bob.  All the characters in the show were voiced by the actors in the films; many characters from the View Askewniverse have quick, but fan-satisfying appearances, such as Steve-Dave or Fanboy.In the first episode, Dante and Randal try to prevent the destruction of their Quick Stop when a futuristic ""Quicker Stop"" is invented by billionaire Leonardo Leonardo (voiced by Alec Baldwin).  In the second episode, Dante and Randal remember their previous adventures while locked in a freezer.  In the third episode, Leonardo Leonardo succumbs to a deadly virus, and the Quick Stop is investigated by an FBI agent (voiced by James Woods).  For the fourth episode, the clerks find themselves being sued by Jay in a court led by the honorable Judge Reinhold (voiced by Judge Reinhold).  For the fifth episode, Dante becomes the coach of Leonardo Leonardo's pathetic Little League team; and, for the final episode - there really isn't a plot.""Clerks"" the series is 100% film-nerd material.  Film nerds (I know - I am one) will enjoy the show much more than the casual movie watcher.  There are multiple references to films and TV shows throughout the series.In the end, I really don't know what to say about ""Clerks"" other than seeing is believing.  It completely surpassed my expectations, and is one of - if not the funniest - cartoon I've ever seen.  This is the sort of thing slackers sit around and watch all day long.

ABC had no clue what they bought when they optioned this thing. Is it funny? Yes! It's f-ing hysterical! However, it wasn't really meant for ABC. ABC did its best to run it in the ground by airing the episodes out of order, they showed episodes 4 and 2 in that order when 2 was built upon and relied on episode 1 to make sense! View Askew fans need this as a part of their collection because of 1: It's really funny, even though it's toned down for TV and in color. Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson did a really great job bringing Dante and Randall to &quot;life&quot; in this. To truly appreciate the job they did you need to see all the episodes in order. Especially the last one in which they blast ABC with both barrels. 2: The DVD commentary track has all the dirt on what happened between Smith and co. and ABC. It's a great abject lesson in how the corporate mentality can ruin a good thing. That and bad Korean animators...There are also some really funny live sequences before each episode with Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith and Jeff Anderson. The little Jay and Silent Bob activity shorts are pretty funny too, even if they are a bit disturbing (O lord Satan I offer up this girls soul...). All in all a great 2 DVD set well worth the money. I only gave it 4 stars because there's no cursing and it's in color and the villains are reminiscent of Mr. Burns and Smithers (Doh!)",4,Great stuff for Clerks fans ...and ABC haters!,1020297600,"05 2, 2002",2002,1513,"['was', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'failed', 'attempt', 'get', 'Clerks', 'masses', 'animated', 'series', 'ABC', 'canned', 'only', 'two', 'airings', 'ABC', 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'bought', 'when', 'optioned', 'thing', 'funny', 'Yes', 'f-ing', 'hysterical', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'meant', 'ABC', 'ABC', 'did', 'best', 'run', 'ground', 'airing', 'episodes', 'order', 'showed', 'episodes', '4', '2', 'order', 'when', '2', 'was', 'built', 'relied', 'episode', '1', 'make', 'sense', 'View', 'Askew', 'fans', 'need', 'part', 'collection', '1', 'really', 'funny', 'even', 'toned', 'down', 'TV', 'color', 'Brian', ""O'Halloran"", 'Jeff', 'Anderson', 'did', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'Dante', 'Randall', 'quot', 'life', 'quot', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'job', 'did', 'need', 'see', 'episodes', 'order', 'Especially', 'last', 'one', 'blast', 'ABC', 'barrels', '2', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'track', 'dirt', 'what', 'happened', 'Smith', 'co.', 'ABC', 'great', 'abject', 'lesson', 'how', 'corporate', 'mentality', 'can', 'ruin', 'good', 'thing', 'bad', 'Korean', 'animators', 'are', 'also', 'really', 'funny', 'live', 'sequences', 'episode', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Jeff', 'Anderson', 'little', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'activity', 'shorts', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'too', 'even', 'are', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'O', 'lord', 'Satan', 'offer', 'up', 'girls', 'soul', 'great', '2', 'DVD', 'set', 'well', 'money', 'only', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'cursing', 'color', 'villains', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'Smithers', 'Doh']",N/A

The story follows Dante and Randall, two devoted clerks at the local quick stop.  They deal with irate customers, annoying movie stars, and Charles Barkley.  I couldn't  stop laughing during this thing.  I know that a lot of people might be turned off by it since it is in a cartoon format, but you have to see this thing.  Only two or three episodes ever aired on television and if you liked those then the other three that are uncensored you will enjoy even more.
