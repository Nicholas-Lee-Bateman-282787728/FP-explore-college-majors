396661,A9HNFACRZ88HA,6304025696,"John Harvey ""John of Lebanon""","[1, 1]","This film should have been left in Italy. The only good part of the movie is the dubbing into English is quite good. The dialog being dubbed is horrible but done quite well. At least the Germans speak German unlike some war movies.If you have an hour and a half to waste it is not the worst movie ever made. However, watch The Dirty Dozen instead.",2,Should Have Stayed in Italy,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,347,"['film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'Italy', 'only', 'good', 'part', 'movie', 'dubbing', 'English', 'quite', 'good', 'dialog', 'being', 'dubbed', 'horrible', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'least', 'Germans', 'speak', 'German', 'war', 'movies.If', 'have', 'hour', 'half', 'waste', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'However', 'watch', 'Dirty', 'Dozen', 'instead']",Five for Hell VHS
396662,A7T1NIWZHTC4P,6304025696,"Seven Kitties ""7kitties""","[10, 11]","Possibly the worst war movie ever made.  Kinski is the ONLY redeeming feature, but Klaus Kinski playing the 'sexy sadist' is hardly a stretch and thus can only debatably be called acting.  The movie is an Italian production, overdubbed into English, except the German dialogue, which is subtitled in Italian.  Can be confusing.  The plot takes 5 misfits to infiltrate an impregnable german fortress to find the dark and sinister Plan K.  To give you an idea of the scope of ludicrosity that plagues this movie, 'our boys' infiltrate this fortress by means of a trampoline that they have smuggled in.  The microfilm is hidden inside a fake wooden baseball, which then becomes a weapon in the only running gag in the movie.  There is NO character development, a sketchy attempt at plot.  The costuming is godawful, especially Kinski's dressing gown.  I would have dated the film to be mid-60s; I was surprised to find out it came out in 1985--that's how dated the clothes and hairstyles were!  I was IN italy in 1985 and people did not look that tacky!  The soundtrack is another abomination.The film is short, too, only about 92 minutes.  You'd think they could have used that extra half hour to inject something like plot?  In a war film, even the cheesiest most jingoistic one, you feel SOME desire to side with our side.  It's bad when you're rooting for the Nazis, and that's how bad this movie is.However, if you need a movie to make fun of, this is a great pick.  I laughed so hard (at parts where the movie was trying to be serious) that I scared my cats.",1,low budget dirty dozen,1087948800,"06 23, 2004",2004,1561,"['Possibly', 'worst', 'war', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Kinski', 'ONLY', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'playing', ""'sexy"", 'sadist', 'hardly', 'stretch', 'thus', 'can', 'only', 'debatably', 'be', 'called', 'acting', 'movie', 'Italian', 'production', 'overdubbed', 'English', 'German', 'dialogue', 'subtitled', 'Italian', 'Can', 'be', 'confusing', 'plot', '5', 'misfits', 'infiltrate', 'impregnable', 'german', 'fortress', 'find', 'dark', 'sinister', 'Plan', 'K.', 'give', 'idea', 'scope', 'ludicrosity', 'movie', 'infiltrate', 'fortress', 'means', 'trampoline', 'have', 'smuggled', 'microfilm', 'hidden', 'fake', 'wooden', 'baseball', 'then', 'weapon', 'only', 'running', 'gag', 'movie', 'character', 'development', 'sketchy', 'attempt', 'plot', 'costuming', 'godawful', 'especially', 'Kinski', 'dressing', 'gown', 'would', 'have', 'dated', 'film', 'be', 'mid-60s', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'came', 'out', '1985', 'how', 'dated', 'clothes', 'hairstyles', 'were', 'was', 'IN', 'italy', '1985', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'tacky', 'soundtrack', 'abomination.The', 'film', 'short', 'too', 'only', '92', 'minutes', ""'d"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'extra', 'hour', 'inject', 'something', 'plot', 'war', 'film', 'even', 'cheesiest', 'most', 'jingoistic', 'one', 'feel', 'SOME', 'desire', 'side', 'side', 'bad', 'when', ""'re"", 'rooting', 'Nazis', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'is.However', 'need', 'movie', 'make', 'fun', 'great', 'pick', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'parts', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'serious', 'scared', 'cats']",Five for Hell VHS
