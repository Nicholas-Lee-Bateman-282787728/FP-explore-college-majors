1364806,A1166FE81ADOUR,B003UESJH4,50s sci-fi Fan,"[5, 5]","I believe this will become one of the most beloved of films. George VI was forced into a role he was ill-equiped to fill. Yet ""Bertie did his best, Bertie always did his best!"" as his wife declared. A humble man made insecure by his imperious father - King George V: ""I was afraid of my father and my children will be afraid of me"" - Bertie was able to take consolation in being a simple naval officer far from the public eye until Edward's abdication.The plot is simple enough; Bertie (Colin Firth) stutters when speaking before an audience, his wife, Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter)seeks the help of a self-taught speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) to remedy his impediment.Yet the courage, vulnerability and humanity of the King and dry Australian humour of Logue in working on Bertie's impediment give the film its charm. George VI's basic decency and approachability endears himself to his people. The cheers and applause of the BBC technicians after the King addresses his Empire in a speech Logue guides him through like an orchestra conductor on the outbreak of WWII would never been extended to the distant George V. The Coronation newsreel was a sweet touch with its follow-on of Hitler's calculated histrionic harangue of his audience.Princess Elizabeth asking, ""What's he saying, Daddy?"" and Bertie replying, ""I don't know, but he seems to be saying rather well.""The part that I found most amusing was when Logue's wife returned to the house unexpectly during one the King's therapeutic visits. Logue behaves like a guilty schoolboy caught with his hand in the biscuit jar...to say more would be a spoiler!The film is a great investment for those times when you need a hero to brighten your day.

1364810,A36A9HWQ9U1IK4,B003UESJH4,"A. Jogalekar ""Curious Wavefunction""","[3, 6]","The King's Speech is one of those movies where everyone does their job impeccably. This includes the director who created a remarkably accurate period piece from the 30s. He manages to accurately portray the environment around the royal family. Colin Firth's Academy Award for his role as the stuttering king was a shoo in. What I liked is that Firth does not overplay the role and indulges in no histrionics. His performance is sincere and the tone is exactly right. The director also avoids the temptation to make the story too dramatic and portray it as some kind of incredible triumph over adversity (it is a movie about stuttering after all, not some story of survival in a concentration camp). At the same time he also manages to convey how acutely debilitating and painful stuttering can be for anyone whose professional career involves public speaking.Geoffrey Rush puts on another one of his fine performances, playing Firth's speech therapist with a droll sense of humor. Rush does a great job of bringing out the personality of a simple and honest man who kept himself from getting swayed by royalty and remained respectful and professional without turning into a servile flatterer or getting cowed by the king. The movies does a wonderful job of portraying the relationship between the two men as one between equals. Helena Bonham Carter also shines as Firth's wife, a wise woman with a dry sense of humor who was supportive and yet independent-minded.Overall this is one of the best period pieces I have seen in the last few years. By honestly portraying King's George's story as it was without any melodramatic flourishes, it gives us an accurate picture of the times and the people.

Out of desperation, he turns to an odd Australian speech therapist who helps the fledgeling monarch cope with issues deeper than his speech defect.There are some historical issues.

The King is George the VI or Bertie as he is known to close family and friends. He is accidentally thrust in to the role of a king when his bother decides to pursue love than ruling the country of Britain. It is wartime and Hitler is on the march, as expected the king is expected to give rousing speeches to rally his countrymen but this king can barely speak to his family, much less the country, without stammering. His wife (Helena Bonham Carter) arranges for him to see an Australian therapist Logue (Geoffrey Rush) who has had many success treating soldiers in his native land.Colin Firth as the king and Geoffrey Rush as his therapist, act superbly and these folks alone make it worth the watch, play two reluctant people who much conquer the differences of class and status, eventually becoming lifelong friends. Colin Firth is simply amazing and gives one of the year's best performances; he is matched step for step by Geoffrey Rush.  Helena Bonham Carter is refreshing and gives credence to the meaning that behind every great man is a equally great woman. Tom Hooper directs amazingly well and the cinematography is equally superb.

Everyone's acting is top notch, particularly Colin Firth, putting on a voice that sounds natural from him, yet compared to his work in other movies, is clearly too high and sharp to be his natural voice.The relationship between Lionel and Bertie is the core of this movie, and the best parts of it.  And yet, due to narrative necessity, we also get insights into the personal lives of both men, with quick scenes of Lionel Logue and his family, and Bertie dealing with the awkwardness involved in being son of George V, with his voluptuous, luxurious voice, and the heir to the throne soon to be King Edward the VIII.  Unless you know the history of the period and recognize these figures (which as an American, I don't), these scenes are largely unremarkable, and not very endearing to help you feel Edward's dilemma, or George V's.  As well, historical figures like Winston Churchill and Neville Chamberlain have very small appearances, barely qualifying as cameos.Helena Bonham Carter as Elizabeth is functional.  She acts, she portrays the character, but she could easily be replaced by any other capable actor and nothing would be lost in the performance or the aura.The best moments of the movie involve Bertie and Lionel, culminating in the King's war-time speech, with Lionel in the booth with him, ""orchestrating"" him, which comes across brilliantly dramatic and climactic.However, the story and its direction comes across as average.  Painfully average.  Everything is so very predictable in how it unfolds, with Lionel Logue being the ""unorthodox"" kook who asks questions more suitable for a therapist than a speech instructor, demands to be called ""Lionel"" and not ""Doctor"" or ""Mister Logue"" as well as to call him ""Bertie"" instead of ""Your Royal Highness"", to doing ""nutty"" things like making a deal with Bertie that if he can recite a monologue from Hamlet without stammering, he won't need to see Lionel ever, to Bertie failing that bet, and Lionel trying the ""crazy"" idea of having him record his voice reciting the monologue, while he has headphones on playing music loud enough to not hear his own voice.And surprise!  He doesn't stammer!  With this obvious clich&eacute;, he goes about under Lionel's tutelage to help with his stammer.Then comes the obvious dramatic conflict in the middle where Bertie stops seeing Lionel because Lionel claims that Bertie will likely be king, despite Edward still being King, which Bertie claims to be treason as a masque for his own fears of becoming King.  Then he does become King, and goes back to seeing Lionel.  This sequence is what I refer to at the start of my review.Then comes the obvious REVELATION as it's discovered Lionel Logue ISN'T a doctor, or a professional of any kind, with Lionel then giving his backstory of how he helped Australian ANZAC veterans from the Gallipoli campaign to speak again after being shell shocked and unable to speak or speak clearly, and defending himself by claiming he never said he was a doctor, kept insisting not to be called doctor, and his office has him listed solely as ""Lionel Logue"" and not doctor.Then the obvious reconciliation and forgiveness and friendship between the two.This movie is not bad, but its only strengths are in its actors and chemistry which only occurs in about half the movie.  Story-wise, it's average and clich&eacute;.  Definitely a worthy Oscar nominee for best actor, supporting actor, etcetera.  Best picture is a far stretch, in my opinion.",4,"What SHOULD constitute ""average"" these days",1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,3754,"['did', 'not', 'hate', 'movie', 'had', 'real', 'weak', 'spots', 'save', 'one', 'claiming', 'term', 'average', '.The', 'story', 'largely', 'obviously', 'Duke', 'York', 'eventual', 'King', 'bunch', 'names', 'called', 'Bertie', 'short', 'George', 'VI', 'stammer', 'Everyone', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'particularly', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'putting', 'voice', 'natural', 'yet', 'compared', 'work', 'other', 'movies', 'clearly', 'too', 'high', 'sharp', 'be', 'natural', 'voice.The', 'relationship', 'Lionel', 'Bertie', 'core', 'movie', 'best', 'parts', 'yet', 'due', 'narrative', 'necessity', 'also', 'get', 'insights', 'personal', 'lives', 'men', 'quick', 'scenes', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'family', 'Bertie', 'dealing', 'awkwardness', 'involved', 'being', 'son', 'George', 'V', 'voluptuous', 'luxurious', 'voice', 'heir', 'throne', 'soon', 'be', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'know', 'history', 'period', 'recognize', 'figures', 'American', 'do', ""n't"", 'scenes', 'are', 'largely', 'unremarkable', 'not', 'very', 'endearing', 'help', 'feel', 'Edward', 'dilemma', 'George', 'V', 'As', 'well', 'historical', 'figures', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'Neville', 'Chamberlain', 'have', 'very', 'small', 'appearances', 'barely', 'qualifying', 'cameos.Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Elizabeth', 'functional', 'character', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'replaced', 'other', 'capable', 'actor', 'nothing', 'would', 'be', 'lost', 'performance', 'aura.The', 'best', 'moments', 'movie', 'involve', 'Bertie', 'Lionel', 'culminating', 'King', 'war-time', 'speech', 'Lionel', 'booth', 'orchestrating', 'brilliantly', 'dramatic', 'climactic.However', 'story', 'direction', 'average', 'Painfully', 'average', 'Everything', 'so', 'very', 'predictable', 'how', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'being', 'unorthodox', 'kook', 'who', 'questions', 'more', 'suitable', 'therapist', 'speech', 'instructor', 'be', 'called', 'Lionel', 'not', 'Doctor', 'Mister', 'Logue', 'as', 'well', 'call', 'Bertie', 'instead', 'Royal', 'Highness', 'doing', 'nutty', 'things', 'making', 'deal', 'Bertie', 'can', 'recite', 'monologue', 'Hamlet', 'stammering', 'wo', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'Lionel', 'ever', 'Bertie', 'failing', 'bet', 'Lionel', 'trying', 'crazy', 'idea', 'having', 'record', 'voice', 'reciting', 'monologue', 'headphones', 'playing', 'music', 'loud', 'enough', 'not', 'hear', 'own', 'voice.And', 'surprise', ""n't"", 'stammer', 'obvious', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Lionel', 'tutelage', 'help', 'stammer.Then', 'obvious', 'dramatic', 'conflict', 'middle', 'where', 'Bertie', 'seeing', 'Lionel', 'Lionel', 'Bertie', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'king', 'Edward', 'still', 'being', 'King', 'Bertie', 'be', 'treason', 'masque', 'own', 'fears', 'becoming', 'King', 'Then', 'become', 'King', 'back', 'seeing', 'Lionel', 'sequence', 'what', 'refer', 'start', 'review.Then', 'obvious', 'REVELATION', 'discovered', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'IS', ""N'T"", 'doctor', 'professional', 'kind', 'Lionel', 'then', 'giving', 'backstory', 'how', 'helped', 'Australian', 'ANZAC', 'veterans', 'Gallipoli', 'campaign', 'speak', 'again', 'being', 'shell', 'shocked', 'unable', 'speak', 'speak', 'clearly', 'defending', 'claiming', 'never', 'said', 'was', 'doctor', 'kept', 'insisting', 'not', 'be', 'called', 'doctor', 'office', 'listed', 'solely', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'not', 'doctor.Then', 'obvious', 'reconciliation', 'forgiveness', 'friendship', 'two.This', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'only', 'strengths', 'are', 'actors', 'chemistry', 'only', 'movie', 'Story-wise', 'average', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Definitely', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'best', 'actor', 'supporting', 'actor', 'etcetera', 'Best', 'picture', 'far', 'stretch', 'opinion']",N/A
1364825,AQQBRDQ2QJOO8,B003UESJH4,Andrew C Wheeler,"[10, 14]","I'm sure someone, somewhere, has begun a review of this movie by imitating stuttering in print. ""I'd like to t-t-t-t-talk ab-b-b-b-b-bout The King's S-s-s-s-speech,"" perhaps. So, since that slot has already been filled, I don't need to be That Guy, which is a relief. (Because That Guy is a jerk, and not funny, either.)THE KING'S SPEECH is a very high-minded, serious, life-affirming movie, of the kind that the English film industry loves to make -- probably because the American public, and the public of many other countries, including their own, eats it up every time -- and it will be deeply familiar and utterly unsurprising to anyone who has seen more than a dozen movies in his life. (Let along being even vaguely familiar with WWII, or the recent history of the British monarchy.)It's all very nice, full of plummy accents, understated posh surroundings, stiff upper lips, and predictable uplift. Movies like this have been winning piles of Oscar awards for eight or nine decades, and there's no sign that the Academy of 2035 will buck that trend, either. The King's Speech is a movie to make adults feel smart and superior and cultured without having to read subtitles, learn anything substantial, or actually consider any unpleasant things existing in the world, now or ever.Colin Firth plays the younger brother of a bad father whom he nevertheless utterly loves, in the way that only tortured-in-public-school British aristocrats can love their families. (Which is to say: completely undemonstratively.) And he's going to be King as soon as that bad father dies and as soon as his equally-bad-in-other-ways older brother decides to abdicate in favor of marrying an American divorcee. Of course, Firth's Prince Bertie is both utterly devoted to his duty and scared to death of it, which makes him perfect for audience-identification purposes: speaking in public is the #1 fear, so a story about a really rich and powerful guy with that fear (and for a good reason!) is a guaranteed hit.And so on and on; Geoffrey Rush is the obligatory oddball guru, whose unusual methods dependably deliver the results that the stuffed-shirt ""establishment"" types can't. And Helena Bonham Carter is given very little to do as the future Queen Mum, but she does it as stiff-upper-lippy as possible. In fact, the story of THE KING'S SPEECH is so tailor-made for a big feel-good movie that one has to wonder why it wasn't made twenty or thirty years ago, probably by Merchant-Ivory. But it did eventually become the movie that was destined to exist, and now destiny won't rest until we all see it. It's a perfectly pleasant two hours of exposed celluloid, so you might as well get it over with, if you haven't already.",3,"A warm, feel-good bath of a movie",1305504000,"05 16, 2011",2011,2712,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'begun', 'review', 'movie', 'imitating', 'stuttering', 'print', ""'d"", 'like', 't-t-t-t-talk', 'King', 'S-s-s-s-speech', 'perhaps', 'So', 'slot', 'already', 'been', 'filled', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'Guy', 'relief', 'Guy', 'jerk', 'not', 'funny', 'either', 'KING', 'SPEECH', 'very', 'high-minded', 'serious', 'life-affirming', 'movie', 'kind', 'English', 'film', 'industry', 'make', 'probably', 'American', 'public', 'public', 'many', 'other', 'countries', 'including', 'own', 'up', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'deeply', 'familiar', 'utterly', 'unsurprising', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'more', 'dozen', 'movies', 'life', 'Let', 'being', 'even', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'WWII', 'recent', 'history', 'British', 'monarchy', 'very', 'nice', 'full', 'plummy', 'accents', 'understated', 'posh', 'surroundings', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lips', 'predictable', 'uplift', 'Movies', 'have', 'been', 'winning', 'piles', 'Oscar', 'awards', 'eight', 'nine', 'decades', 'sign', 'Academy', '2035', 'will', 'buck', 'trend', 'either', 'King', 'Speech', 'movie', 'make', 'adults', 'feel', 'smart', 'superior', 'cultured', 'having', 'read', 'subtitles', 'learn', 'anything', 'substantial', 'actually', 'consider', 'unpleasant', 'things', 'existing', 'world', 'now', 'ever.Colin', 'Firth', 'younger', 'brother', 'bad', 'father', 'whom', 'nevertheless', 'utterly', 'loves', 'way', 'only', 'tortured-in-public-school', 'British', 'aristocrats', 'can', 'love', 'families', 'Which', 'say', 'completely', 'undemonstratively', 'going', 'be', 'King', 'as', 'soon', 'bad', 'father', 'dies', 'as', 'soon', 'equally-bad-in-other-ways', 'older', 'brother', 'abdicate', 'favor', 'marrying', 'American', 'divorcee', 'course', 'Firth', 'Prince', 'Bertie', 'utterly', 'devoted', 'duty', 'scared', 'death', 'perfect', 'audience-identification', 'purposes', 'speaking', 'public', '1', 'fear', 'story', 'really', 'rich', 'powerful', 'guy', 'fear', 'good', 'reason', 'guaranteed', 'hit.And', 'so', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'obligatory', 'oddball', 'guru', 'unusual', 'methods', 'dependably', 'deliver', 'results', 'stuffed-shirt', 'establishment', 'types', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'given', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'future', 'Queen', 'Mum', 'as', 'stiff-upper-lippy', 'possible', 'fact', 'story', 'THE', 'KING', 'SPEECH', 'so', 'tailor-made', 'big', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'probably', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'did', 'eventually', 'become', 'movie', 'was', 'destined', 'exist', 'now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rest', 'see', 'perfectly', 'pleasant', 'two', 'hours', 'exposed', 'celluloid', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'have', ""n't"", 'already']",N/A

He plays the stammering Prince Albert (and later King George VI) and does it with panache.  This could be an Oscar winning role.In brief, the plot of the film covers the traumas faced by ""Bertie"" when forced to speak in public.  He has an overpowering stammer which he seems unable to overcome.  His wife (Helena Bonham Carter), however, suggests the services of an unconventional Australian doctor, Lionel Logue, as played by Geoffrey Rush.  Logue treats the prince as an equal.  No kowtowing or deference.  Results are all  that he cares about and it is results that he is driven to provide.  Perhaps the rest is history.  The prince/king does eventually overcome his speech impediment and it is no small thanks to Logue.  Indeed, Rush excels as the masterful therapist.

It's well paced and acted and unusually witty in certain areas.  At the end of the viewing experience you won't feel the uproarious amount of inner-triumph that the promotional campaign tried to shove down your throat, but you will be wearing a smile; and why not.`The King's Speech' has charm.The film, which could have very easily become a redundant bore, has nicely placed delicate touches that make it palatable; a twinkle of charm and grace lacing most scenes.  The performances as a whole are beautifully restrained, adding a realism to each note.  Colin Firth is VERY good, as is Geoffrey Rush (who pulls back on his usual hamminess to deliver a simple yet refined performance).  One cannot ignore the fact that the film is beautiful to look at.  The cinematography is sharp and sweeping, the costumes are authentic and eye catching and the production design (THOSE WALLS) is just pitch perfect.  Understanding that the subject matter is a stretch, the production team worked their backsides off to create a visually arresting atmosphere, and it shows.Here's my issue; `The King's Speech', while `quote-unquote' delightful, is also teetering on elevated mediocrity.Let me take you back a few months to when `The King's Speech' was released in the theaters and there was that huge push to garner it the big Oscar wins (namely Best Picture and Best Director).  The competition was scarce.  In fact, there was only ONE film in the way; `The Social Network'.  In an attempt to dethrone what seemed infallible, The Weinstein Company (buying Oscars left and right) released a series of ads claiming this film to be a total `triumph of the human spirit'.  You saw countless people (obviously paid actors) claiming how this film changed their lives and makes a difference and all that `yadda yadda yadda'.  In other words; `The King's Speech' is the second coming.  The truth of the matter is that the film is pretty but somewhat vapid.  When all is said and done, you walk away thinking ""was that it?"" and wondering what all the hoopla was about.  I understand Firth's Oscar and I understand the nominations (most of them at least) but I'll never understand how a film with very little depth could manage what this film did.  I understand the whole idea that watching someone overcome their seemingly small obstacles can be encouraging and uplifting, but even the way that it is presented in the film borders on the absurd (placing more weight on his speech than the imposing war was kind of ridiculous).  While it bypasses the redundancy for the most part, it also loses some connective tissue in the process.In the end, `The King's Speech' is a fine film that will make you smile, but that is all.

Lessons in modern psychology and self-help with such themes as parenting, teaching, and self esteem are more than suggested.  Nevertheless, this is a movie worth watching; one that does not disappoint.The acting is captivating.  Although the movie hints at the failures of many, including King George V, as causes for the dilemma, the real antagonist in the movie is the speech impediment itself.  The movie promotes values--nobility, honor, trust, confidence, and loyalty-that are increasingly lacking in many movies.  Hitler is presented as the historical villain but just as a backdrop primarily in contrast with those values.I found this to be one of the least boring and least disappointing movies I have seen in the past decade, and this was done without nudity, without technology, without gore, and without gimmicks.

1364839,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B003UESJH4,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[0, 1]","The King's Speech was probably one of the best films I've seen in a long time.  While I can't say that the central character was a ""true"" likeness of the future king of England during World War II, I think as a dramatic creation he certainly ""rings true.""  Colin Firth did a fantastic job of portraying him.  The sense of frustration, anxiety, sadness, and isolation he created for his character was amazing.Most surprising I think, though it probably shouldn't have been, is the degree to which the prince was subject to what would be considered patent child abuse today.  It probably shouldn't have been, since the power that came to individuals favored by the king since childhood was often formidable, and the Prince of Wales was to have become king, not his younger brother.  The wonder isn't that he stuttered but that he wasn't considerably more impaired than he was by his experiences.  The fact that he could overcome his more overt signs of that oppressive upbringing with the help of the individual he consulted reveals his considerable determination as a person and the great emotional support he received as an adult from others in doing so.  His personal conflict over becoming the king was very poignant.  One is generally led to believe that individuals would--and did--kill to become king; watching someone try everything he could not to be was enlightening.  It also puts into perspective the desperate circumstances of former usurpers; the threats to them and to the country had to have been major, not only for one to undertake treason but for one to undertake the headaches of rule.The character of Wallis Simpson, while she did not appear often in the movie, was one that was pivotal to history.  She was well portrayed in the film; part real person, part public perception.  While I have not read her own history, I have read books in which she featured, and it would appear that she was part of the 19th century phenomenon usually practiced by wealthy 500 families in America, that of marrying a daughter to a financially strapped noble family, sort of  ""aristocrat"" by proxy.  I strongly suspect that Mrs. Simpson, who was definitely not of the 500, expected to ""make the big time"" in terms of American social climbing by becoming a reigning queen; in that she definitely misread the British people of the time--and when it came to the monarchy, everyone below the king was ""the British people!""  Morganatic marriages are not something that is well accepted even today, as questions of Kate Middleton's ""commoner"" status suggest.  The divorced status of Camilla Bowles brought her future as ""queen"" into question for a long time.One of the things I found most intriguing was the king's status under parliamentary government.  It would appear that whereas the kings of earlier times were themselves often guilty of abusing the ""people,"" their function in more recent times has been as a focus of power that moderates the abuses of the people's own elected government.  Elected parliament members might have short term personal agendas, but the hereditary monarch can and does take the long term point of view; England is more-or-less his ""estate,"" and he doesn't want to go ""out of business!""  I'm not sure if this impression is true or not, but it certainly seemed to be in the film.",5,Wonderful film,1297296000,"02 10, 2011",2011,3308,"['King', 'Speech', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'central', 'character', 'was', 'true', 'likeness', 'future', 'king', 'England', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'think', 'dramatic', 'creation', 'certainly', 'rings', 'true', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'portraying', 'sense', 'frustration', 'anxiety', 'sadness', 'isolation', 'created', 'character', 'was', 'amazing.Most', 'surprising', 'think', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'degree', 'prince', 'was', 'subject', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'patent', 'child', 'abuse', 'today', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'power', 'came', 'individuals', 'favored', 'king', 'childhood', 'was', 'often', 'formidable', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'was', 'have', 'become', 'king', 'not', 'younger', 'brother', 'wonder', ""n't"", 'stuttered', 'was', ""n't"", 'considerably', 'more', 'impaired', 'was', 'experiences', 'fact', 'could', 'overcome', 'more', 'overt', 'signs', 'oppressive', 'upbringing', 'help', 'individual', 'consulted', 'reveals', 'considerable', 'determination', 'person', 'great', 'emotional', 'support', 'received', 'adult', 'others', 'doing', 'so', 'personal', 'conflict', 'becoming', 'king', 'was', 'very', 'poignant', 'One', 'generally', 'led', 'believe', 'individuals', 'would', 'did', 'kill', 'become', 'king', 'watching', 'someone', 'try', 'everything', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'was', 'enlightening', 'also', 'perspective', 'desperate', 'circumstances', 'former', 'usurpers', 'threats', 'country', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'undertake', 'treason', 'one', 'undertake', 'headaches', 'rule.The', 'character', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'often', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'pivotal', 'history', 'was', 'well', 'portrayed', 'film', 'part', 'real', 'person', 'part', 'public', 'perception', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'own', 'history', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'featured', 'would', 'appear', 'was', 'part', '19th', 'century', 'phenomenon', 'usually', 'practiced', 'wealthy', '500', 'families', 'America', 'marrying', 'daughter', 'financially', 'strapped', 'noble', 'family', 'sort', 'aristocrat', 'proxy', 'strongly', 'suspect', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson', 'who', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', '500', 'expected', 'make', 'big', 'time', 'terms', 'American', 'social', 'climbing', 'becoming', 'reigning', 'queen', 'definitely', 'misread', 'British', 'people', 'time', 'when', 'came', 'monarchy', 'everyone', 'king', 'was', 'British', 'people', 'Morganatic', 'marriages', 'are', 'not', 'something', 'well', 'accepted', 'even', 'today', 'questions', 'Kate', 'Middleton', 'commoner', 'status', 'suggest', 'divorced', 'status', 'Camilla', 'Bowles', 'brought', 'future', 'queen', 'question', 'long', 'time.One', 'things', 'found', 'most', 'intriguing', 'was', 'king', 'status', 'parliamentary', 'government', 'would', 'appear', 'kings', 'earlier', 'times', 'were', 'often', 'guilty', 'abusing', 'people', 'function', 'more', 'recent', 'times', 'been', 'focus', 'power', 'abuses', 'people', 'own', 'elected', 'government', 'Elected', 'parliament', 'members', 'might', 'have', 'short', 'term', 'personal', 'agendas', 'hereditary', 'monarch', 'can', 'take', 'long', 'term', 'point', 'view', 'England', 'more-or-less', 'estate', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'business', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'impression', 'true', 'not', 'certainly', 'seemed', 'be', 'film']",N/A

But when his reckless brother steps down from the throne, he finds himself in a position he never thought he'd be; leader of an empire. But with trouble brewing overseas and his new position demanding that he makes speeches to the public, he turns to Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian speech therapist, for help and the two form an unlikely friendship.If you haven't already figured out from the 5-stars and the heading, I absolutely loved `The King's Speech', it's beautifully shot, the production is gorgeous and is anchored by stellar performances from some of UK's, and Australia's, top actors.Colin Firth is at his best here as the suffering Prince Albert, conveying layers of emotion both in voice and body language and getting us emotionally connected with Albert and we're really rooting for him to overcome his stammer by the end. Geoffrey Rush is equally as good as Lionel Logue; confident, straight forward and unwilling to kowtow to Albert's status and when the two share a scene together, it's electrifying to watch as their friendship develops throughout the film.Helena Bonham Carter, away from the weird-wacky Tim Burton roles also shines as Albert's supportive wife, Elizabeth, as does Guy Pearce, playing a brash Edward VIII.It's not just the strong acting, although it's really what drives the film; it's the production design, the sets, the costumes really do a great job at bringing this world back to life. They also made sure to flesh out the world by surrounding it in history, with the threat of World War II always looming in the background, and to represent the attitudes of the people at the time, especially the way the English looked down on Australians. Everything here pulls together to make this a compelling and elegant film, if you like period movies or shows like `Downton Abbey', then this is worth the watch, if not the purchase, and is deserving of the four academy awards under it's belt.There's a sleuth of Special Features on the disc; a commentary track, an okay behind the scenes featurette and `BBC America Special' with Q&A; with the director and cast.

1364859,A30TQET02FLSUX,B003UESJH4,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[1, 1]","Let me start by saying that The King's Speech (2010) is fun to watch. I really enjoyed going to the theater and sitting with a large crowd to see this film. It's not quite as fresh and funny as The Kids Are All Right (2010), but it's well written, well acted, and nicely crafted. The movie's pacing is a bit slow at times, but with so many great scenes throughout the film, I was able to get through the boring bits. I give it 3.5 stars out of 5, and it's definitely one of my Top 10 movies of 2010. Actor Colin Firth is the star of this historic biopic about King George VI of Britain, and it's another incredible performance by him in a role that will probably get him the Best Actor Oscar next month. Firth was nominated in 2009 for Best Actor in A Single Man (2009), director Tom Ford's absolutely brilliant feature film debut. With these two excellent acting performances back to back, Firth has positioned himself as a real dramatic leading man, of which we seemingly have so few today.King George VI was a stutterer, suffering with an inability to speak clearly at a time when radio was coming into its golden age as the primary means of mass communication. Set primarily in the 1930s, and leading up to World War II, The King's Speech is a fascinating and enjoyable look into the 20th century British Monarchy from behind-the-scenes. King George VI suffered from a severe speech impediment that initially kept him from ascending to the throne over his brother. But as his brother King Edward VIII, played by Guy Pearce, pursued a ""scandalous"" relationship with an American woman, George was forced to take over for his brother as King when Edward abdicated the throne. As King, especially during the impending World War II crisis, George was forced to give speeches both in person and over the radio in order to keep his country's citizens united and strengthened. These radio speeches are now historically famous and well documented as crucial in Britain's build-up to fighting Hitler and Germany.Apparently King George VI struggled to find a speech therapist who could get to the core of his problem: emotional confidence. But George ultimately found the right guy to help him and trust with his wife the Queen's assistance, in the unorthodox and ""illegitimate"" workings of Lionel Logue, played perfectly by Geoffrey Rush. Rush brings a wacky, intelligent, and heart-warming performance to the screen as Logue, which he's been nominated for as Best Supporting Actor in this year's Oscars. It's right up there with his best work in Shine (1996), Shakespeare In Love (1998), Elizabeth (1998), and the Pirates of the Caribbean films. The best scenes in the film are always between Rush and Firth, their onscreen chemistry is just pitch perfect in The King's Speech. I'm not sure that one could have done it without the other. Helena Bonham Carter is hilarious and wonderful in her role as Queen Elizabeth, wife to Colin Firth's King George. It's her most ""restrained"" work I've ever seen. Carter usually plays extremely over-the-top characters that you love for their incredible weirdness. But as the Queen, she shows another side of her comedic and dramatic acting talents. It's a brilliant performance that she's been nominated for it in this year's Oscars as Best Supporting Actress.With an incredible script and cast, British director Tom Hooper has brought his A-game to The King's Speech. After seeing his work on HBO's stunning historical miniseries John Adams (2008), I knew this movie would have a unique look and feel. Hooper is clearly a director who focuses on the details. Every set, every location, every shot has a fascinating detailed look about it. Hooper is a visual storyteller that brings his unique style and point of view to his work and it clearly shines in collaboration with his cast and crew. I also recently watched Hooper's film The Damned United (2009), after seeing The King's Speech, and it's another good film showing Hooper's talent as a filmmaker. I definitely want to catch up with Hooper's work and see HBO's highly regarded short miniseries Elizabeth I (2005).The production design on The King's Speech by Eve Stewart is spot-on, giving the movie a genuine historic look and feel for every set, location, costume, and prop. Part of what I really love about historical movies is always the incredible attention to detail in the production design. It almost always gives those films something that makes them stand out from the pack. The old radio microphones and technology, combined with Colin Firth's emotional body language, make you feel right in your bones that you are there in the 1930s. That's not an easy feat in today's modern world, but Stewart and her art department team did a top notch job doing it.Like any great movie, the cinematography either makes the story more engaging for the viewer, or it takes away and distracts the viewer from the story. Director of Photography Danny Cohen brings a great visual look to The King's Speech through his lighting and camera shot choices. There are visuals from this film that still wander around my mind on a daily basis weeks after I've seen the film. And whenever I hear the name ""The King's Speech"", I immediately remember some of the incredible photographic images from the movie. Cohen definitely deserved his recent Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography for The King's Speech. It's one of the best looking films from 2010.While music composer Alexandre Desplat's original score for The King's Speech is good solid work that fits the film very nicely, I'm not quite as enamored by it as some critics and music aficionados. I do want to listen to it a few more times on its own, separate from the film, to garner a more full opinion on it. But I Desplat did a great job bringing his musical talents to The King's Speech for what it needed.Finally, I can't say enough about screenwriter David Seidler's script for The King's Speech. I listened to a great iTunes podcast interview with Seidler by Jeff Goldsmith of Creative Screenwriting Magazine, where they discussed this screenplay and it's own interesting backstory. This movie was decades in the making, since Seidler had to agree to not write the script or make the movie until Queen Elizabeth, wife of King George VI, had passed away. And of course this kind of material and subject matter was not popular in Hollywood regardless, so getting financing for the film was its own struggle. But Seidler's passionate commitment to this story, his writing, and this film really came through. If it weren't for a very competitive original film script field in this year's Oscar nominations, I would probably choose Seidler's script as the best of 2010. But it wouldn't surprise me if Seidler wins the Oscar over my choice of Christopher Nolan for Inception.The King's Speech is a real treat of a movie, one you can take the whole family to in my opinion. I'm flabbergasted that our MPAA Ratings Board is so archaic in their thinking that just because the F-word is used more than once in this movie that it deserves an 'R' rating. There's no nudity or violence, just a few expletive words in a hilarious speech therapy scene. This is really just a PG-13 film and I'm glad to see that the film's 'R' rating has not made much of a difference at the box office. Go see this film while you still can at the theater...it's worth every dollar you spend on your ticket.",4,One of the best films of 2010...a real treat in the theater (3.5 stars)!,1296086400,"01 27,

At the advent of radio becoming a indispensable tool to communicate, he's the man for the job, but one impediment stands as an obstacle to ever exercising all this able man's rich talents and gifts: his stuttering and stammering!A humiliating and last resort attempt to overcome this with the help of a non-accredited speech therapist (although he's more than that) slowly--and sometimes much too slowly for the soon to be king and the patience and perseverance required of him--brings about a triumph. All the same, it is a make or break situation at every moment. It is like living that which Winston Churchill was to have quoted, ""Success is the ability to go from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm."" Or, like those words from the poem ""Don't Quit"" that tell us:""Don't give up though the pace seems slow--You may succeed with another blow,Success is failure turned inside out--""There's that all-familiar line, ""It was beauty killed the beast,"" (from King Kong). A modified version of that quote works here, saying ""It was friendship that killed the beast!"" Friendship was at the bottom of this success--a friendship that was to be life-long.For us it strikes the question: ""How many of us really know the value of friendship--the great dignity of friendship--one true friend--and the good that it does in our lives?""One limitation in this movie is the language. It's not that its usage does not help to make the movie work. It's that maybe the word ""damn"" and others like it might have been used in place of the more vulgar four-letter words that are used. I am not being prudish in this. It is just that this movie has significant value for so many people, especially the young, for whom these words might not be appropriate.

Velasquez,"[4, 5]","By this time, anybody that reads the news, particularly the entertainment sections, or simply loves movies, probably knows that ""The King's Speech"" deservedly won the Best Picture Prize at the 83rd Academy Award ceremonies. This is what good filmmaking is all about: a simple, yet fascinating story, with no special effects, but classy nevertheless. And all these qualities are augmented with the very special Blu-ray edition of this grandiose film.The story begins in 1925, when England's King George V (Michael Gambon) asks his second son, the Duke of York (Colin Firth), to give the closing speech at the Empire Exhibition, in Wembley, London. Right away, we notice that the Duke has trouble speaking - he has difficulty saying the words, some kind of stuttering. We then go to 1934, and we find out that the Duke is still trying to cure his speech impediment. He is doing this in strict secrecy, with the help of Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), his wife. They do this for a while, with no success, until someone recommends the services of Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). With time, the Duke and Lionel establish an apparent close bond, which at times is volatile due to the Duke's ego. After a while, the Duke quits Lionel's services and goes back to his imperial life. However, things drastically change when King George V gets sick and dies.  His immediate successor is King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce), who, because he chose to marry a divorced woman, gave away his right, under the law, to be king. This situation forces the Duke of York to accept the responsibility to be King George VI.  It also forces the Duke to reconnect with Lionel and restart his speech therapy. And this will prove to be crucial, because England was about to go to war with Germany, and, as one of his advisors tells him, ""I'm very much afraid, Sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.""""The King's Speech"" is a tale of a very special friendship that, in some way, was apparently important at a pivotal period in England's history. Danny Cohen's Oscar -nominated cinematography is majestic and absorbing.

1364875,AKV2BGUT50B1X,B003UESJH4,Carl Robinson,"[0, 0]","The life on times of British Royalty is always interesting.  This movie tells the story of Britain's King during World War II, George VI (played by Colin Firth).  ""Bertie"" as the King was known to his family was a conscientious member of the Royal Family who had a terrible stutter.  His speeches were a trial for himself and those listening.This movie tells how Bertie controls his stammering with the help of his speech therapist.  The interplay between the low-born Australian Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) and the king is heartwarming and entertaining.This is an inspiring movie that has two interesting story-telling ways.First:  The story focuses on Bertie overcoming his speech impediment, not anything else.  During the lead-up to the climactic scene, the various functionaries in the British Empire, the Prime Minister, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and others all support the plot tension that the King must make the most important speech of his career-Great Britain's declaration of war against Germany.  As the king approaches the microphone, he doesn't get any re-assurances from Churchill that the RAF will keep off German Bombers-the script is written with the focus on the fact that he must deliver a rousing speech.Second:  The reigning King/Dynasty in Britain seem to align with the poets and playwrights.  This script treats the coup of ""The Establishment"" and King George VI against his older brother King Edward VIII as a natural, by-the-right occurrence.  It is remarkable that the play Richard III treats the defeat of King Richard by Henry Tudor as the same sort of a thing.  The play Richard III is alluded to in this movie also.",5,"A Focused, Heartwarming Story",1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,1686,"['life', 'times', 'British', 'Royalty', 'always', 'interesting', 'movie', 'story', 'Britain', 'King', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'George', 'VI', 'played', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Bertie', 'King', 'was', 'known', 'family', 'was', 'conscientious', 'member', 'Royal', 'Family', 'who', 'had', 'terrible', 'stutter', 'speeches', 'were', 'trial', 'listening.This', 'movie', 'how', 'Bertie', 'stammering', 'help', 'speech', 'therapist', 'interplay', 'low-born', 'Australian', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'king', 'heartwarming', 'entertaining.This', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'two', 'interesting', 'story-telling', 'ways.First', 'story', 'Bertie', 'overcoming', 'speech', 'impediment', 'not', 'anything', 'else', 'lead-up', 'climactic', 'scene', 'various', 'functionaries', 'British', 'Empire', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Archbishop', 'Canterbury', 'Queen', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'others', 'support', 'plot', 'tension', 'King', 'must', 'make', 'most', 'important', 'speech', 'career-Great', 'Britain', 'declaration', 'war', 'Germany', 'king', 'microphone', ""n't"", 'get', 're-assurances', 'Churchill', 'RAF', 'will', 'keep', 'off', 'German', 'Bombers-the', 'script', 'written', 'focus', 'fact', 'must', 'deliver', 'rousing', 'speech.Second', 'reigning', 'King/Dynasty', 'Britain', 'seem', 'align', 'poets', 'playwrights', 'script', 'coup', 'Establishment', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'older', 'brother', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'natural', 'by-the-right', 'occurrence', 'remarkable', 'play', 'Richard', 'III', 'defeat', 'King', 'Richard', 'Henry', 'Tudor', 'same', 'sort', 'thing', 'play', 'Richard', 'III', 'alluded', 'movie', 'also']",N/A

For those of us who have been following him since he played Darcy in the '90s, we all could not be more pleased for him.There is really something terribly wrong with the Oscars if Firth doesn't win this time.  I cannot imagine another actor surpassing this performance.  He covers every variable of King George VI's character and emotions as he struggles with becoming King despite a horrendous stammering problem.  The rigid strictures of his childhood as relayed to his therapist indeed make the problem not all that surprising.  We discover another bad trait to his abdicating brother David's character (as if we needed another one) in that he ridiculed Bertie's stuttering and stammering to his face from early childhood forward.This is not the only superlative performance, however.  Helena Bonham Carter as his wife and Queen is also outstanding in every scene.  It is quite a love story between these two as well, certainly something else quite unusual in the House of Windsor. It is amazing that such a faithful and in love couple could be followed by so many grandchildren who had such trouble finding the same.Geoffrey Rush is also quite wonderful as the speech therapist and he too shines every time he is on camera.  He and Firth are particularly marvelous together.Even if you do not like royal stories in general, this so transcends the usual royal story in every respect that it is hard to imagine anyone not being won over to this wonderful film.",5,Colin Firth's Most Magnificent Role Yet,1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,1538,"['Update', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'was', 'not', 'robbed', 'Oscar', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'played', 'Darcy', ""'90s"", 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'pleased', 'really', 'something', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'Oscars', 'Firth', ""n't"", 'win', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'actor', 'surpassing', 'performance', 'variable', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'character', 'emotions', 'becoming', 'King', 'horrendous', 'stammering', 'problem', 'rigid', 'strictures', 'childhood', 'relayed', 'therapist', 'indeed', 'make', 'problem', 'not', 'surprising', 'discover', 'bad', 'trait', 'abdicating', 'brother', 'David', 'character', 'needed', 'one', 'ridiculed', 'Bertie', 'stuttering', 'stammering', 'face', 'early', 'childhood', 'forward.This', 'not', 'only', 'superlative', 'performance', 'however', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'wife', 'Queen', 'also', 'outstanding', 'scene', 'quite', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'certainly', 'something', 'else', 'quite', 'unusual', 'House', 'Windsor', 'amazing', 'faithful', 'love', 'couple', 'could', 'be', 'followed', 'so', 'many', 'grandchildren', 'who', 'had', 'such', 'trouble', 'finding', 'same.Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'also', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'speech', 'therapist', 'too', 'time', 'camera', 'Firth', 'are', 'particularly', 'marvelous', 'together.Even', 'do', 'not', 'royal', 'stories', 'general', 'so', 'usual', 'royal', 'story', 'respect', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'not', 'being', 'won', 'wonderful', 'film']",N/A

B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This is an excellent film that explores the ability to overcome adversity and the power of relationships in providing the support needed to overcome adversity. Colin Firth plays Prince Albert, the Duke of York, who later becomes George VI. Helena Bonham-Carter plays his wife Elizabeth. Early in the film we see that the loving relationship between Elizabeth and her husband, Bertie, as he is called by family members, is in stark contrast to the chilly formal relationship that Bertie has to his father King George V and his mother, Queen Mary. Michael Gambon plays King George V, a not unsympathetic figure, but certainly completely in the dark in understanding the stammer with which Bertie struggles. It is Elizabeth, Duchess of York, who pursues some efforts to help her husband it is she who makes the first contacts with Lionel Logue, an Australian, who came to London after World War I. Gradually a relationship is built between Lionel and Bertie on which the speech therapy can progress. But there is an underlying reason why this story is of such importance. England faced a great challenge with the growth of Nazi Germany and the future was uncertain. In addition, after the death of George V, Bertie's older brother Edward became king. King Edward VIII was not mentally strong or emotionally mature enough to serve as king and he abdicates the throne to marry an American woman who had been twice divorced. Guy Pearce is excellent as Edward VIII, a charming and sophisticated man with limited intelligence and strength of character.  Thus Bertie and Elizabeth are thrown into roles they never expected to inherit and Bertie, as George VI, must be the voice of authority and reassurance as England enters a tense and unsure time in relationship to Nazi Germany. This is the historic background on which the film is based, but the film actually spends the majority of time exploring the interactions between Bertie and Lionel as Lionel helps Bertie explore the emotional underpinnings of his stammer and develop the skills to overcome the disability. Elizabeth finds Lionel and begins to believe in his services but the relationship with Bertie has several starts and stops.  Lionel comes to understand that Bertie has the moral character and determination to lead England should a war arise with Germany and Bertie comes to judge Lionel by the services he offers and the devotion he has to Bertie rather than by his credentials. The room in which Bertie and Lionel work is certainly worth mentioning since it is a large room with skylights and about 20 layers of wallpaper scraps clinging to the walls forming a fascinating collage that serves as the background of much of the human interaction in the film.  Lionel is extremely protective of the process he undertakes with Bertie and even his wife, played by Jennifer Ehle, does not know the true identity of this client. All the actors were superb and Colin Firth is excellent as George VI but Geoffrey Rush was spectacular as Lionel. The film is excellent and its core message of teamwork and trusting relationships in overcoming adversity rings true.",5,Trusting relationships and teamwork overcome adversity,1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,3115,"['excellent', 'film', 'ability', 'overcome', 'adversity', 'power', 'relationships', 'providing', 'support', 'needed', 'overcome', 'adversity', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'Duke', 'York', 'who', 'later', 'George', 'VI', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Early', 'film', 'see', 'loving', 'relationship', 'Elizabeth', 'husband', 'Bertie', 'called', 'family', 'members', 'stark', 'contrast', 'chilly', 'formal', 'relationship', 'Bertie', 'father', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'mother', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'not', 'unsympathetic', 'figure', 'certainly', 'completely', 'dark', 'understanding', 'stammer', 'Bertie', 'Elizabeth', 'Duchess', 'York', 'who', 'efforts', 'help', 'husband', 'who', 'first', 'contacts', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'Australian', 'who', 'came', 'London', 'World', 'War', 'Gradually', 'relationship', 'built', 'Lionel', 'Bertie', 'speech', 'therapy', 'can', 'progress', 'underlying', 'reason', 'why', 'story', 'such', 'importance', 'England', 'faced', 'great', 'challenge', 'growth', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'future', 'was', 'uncertain', 'addition', 'death', 'George', 'V', 'Bertie', 'older', 'brother', 'Edward', 'became', 'king', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'was', 'not', 'mentally', 'strong', 'emotionally', 'mature', 'enough', 'serve', 'king', 'throne', 'marry', 'American', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'twice', 'divorced', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'excellent', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'charming', 'sophisticated', 'man', 'limited', 'intelligence', 'strength', 'character', 'Thus', 'Bertie', 'Elizabeth', 'are', 'thrown', 'roles', 'never', 'expected', 'inherit', 'Bertie', 'George', 'VI', 'must', 'be', 'voice', 'authority', 'reassurance', 'England', 'tense', 'unsure', 'time', 'relationship', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'historic', 'background', 'film', 'based', 'film', 'actually', 'majority', 'time', 'exploring', 'interactions', 'Bertie', 'Lionel', 'Lionel', 'Bertie', 'emotional', 'underpinnings', 'stammer', 'develop', 'skills', 'overcome', 'disability', 'Elizabeth', 'Lionel', 'believe', 'services', 'relationship', 'Bertie', 'several', 'starts', 'stops', 'Lionel', 'understand', 'Bertie', 'moral', 'character', 'determination', 'lead', 'England', 'should', 'war', 'arise', 'Germany', 'Bertie', 'judge', 'Lionel', 'services', 'devotion', 'Bertie', 'rather', 'credentials', 'room', 'Bertie', 'Lionel', 'work', 'certainly', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'large', 'room', 'skylights', '20', 'layers', 'wallpaper', 'scraps', 'clinging', 'walls', 'forming', 'fascinating', 'collage', 'background', 'much', 'human', 'interaction', 'film', 'Lionel', 'extremely', 'protective', 'process', 'Bertie', 'even', 'wife', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'not', 'know', 'true', 'identity', 'client', 'actors', 'were', 'superb', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'excellent', 'George', 'VI', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'was', 'spectacular', 'Lionel', 'film', 'excellent', 'core', 'message', 'teamwork', 'trusting', 'relationships', 'overcoming', 'adversity', 'rings', 'true']",N/A
1364883,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B003UESJH4,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 3]","The King's Speech is a shoe-in to win the Oscar for Best Picture, as is Colin Firth for his role as Prince Albert and then King George VI. Geoffrey Rush deserves an Oscar for best supporting, though let's not rush to judgement. In a way his role was equal to the King, just as he demanded they treat each other as equals in their speech therapy sessions, but he wasn't hampered by a speech impediment, unless you count an Australian accent. OK, us yanks can't really tell the difference between a British accent and an Australian, but apparantly it is a big deal.Rush really did a great job of acting, and so did Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi, and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill. Gambon, Pearce, and Bonham Carter, as royals, were all too human, but to the manner born, make no mistake. Derek Jacobi, who you might have seen as the Roman Emperor Claudius, in I, Claudius, was sufficiently sanctimonius as Archbishop Cosmo Lang, though I wouldn't have minded seeing Dana Carvey in the role, just for laughs (on second thought, it would have been very distracting, no matter how straight Carvey played it, to have the Church Lady cast as an Archbishop). Some might say that Timothy Spall was too ugly to play Winston Churchill, but I say he was just the right amount of ugly. Another great character role for Wormtail.On the surface, it wouldn't really seem like a stutterer's speech therapy would make a cinematically rich enough subject for an Oscar worthy film, but it was remarkably well done, and also the stakes were high. It was an historic moment, as England was on the brink of World War II, and the recent innovation of radio broadcasting meant The King's Speech would be heard throughout the nation, and the world. A lot was riding on this speech, and as Ludwig Van Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, Second Movement, gradually swells to a climax, we hear the results.I am going to go out on a limb, and predict that The King's speech will win the Oscar for Best Picture. It's not much of a limb, as they are giving it 5 to 6 odds to win in Vegas.Colin Firth was Lord Wessex, and Geoffrey Rush was Philip Henslowe inShakespeare in Love (Miramax Collector's Series)(1998)Colin Firth was Harry inMamma Mia!

It's a movie I'm glad I waited to see.Opening at the closing of the Wembley expedition with a speech by the Duke of York, his first dreaded public speech broadcasted over the radio, a determined duke and his wife seek ways to cure him of his stammer.  The seriousness of the stammer is never truly depicted here in the movie, but soon the viewer sees that this movie is more than just a movie about a stammering duke.  It's about the trust, loyalty and friendship between a commoner and a monarch, of the love between husband and wife, father and children, and a British people to their king.Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush both received Oscars nominations for their performance in this movie; Firth won his for best actor.  Everyone in this movie acted their parts quite well: Helena Bonham Carter as the duchess and Guy Pearce as the older prince and brother Edward VIII.The duchess is the one who seeks the help of Mr Lionel Logue, a famed speech therapist from Australia.  He is a commoner who has his own consultation office away from Buckinham Castle and other more royal hangouts.  It is in this dungeon of an office where most of the unconventional speech training takes place.  It doesn't take long for Logue to see that most of ""Bertie""'s (as the future king is called by Logue) stammer is due to the stress of being a royal, a prince who was heavily teased by his brother for his stammer.Prince Edward VIII decides to abdicate in late 1936 to marry his sweetheart Wallis Simpson.  The Duke is now pushed to the front of the royal line.  He is not ready for this and clearly his stammer gets worse as the thought of being the next king strikes fear in his heart.  The king overcomes his fear through the persistence, patience and humor of his therapit Logue.Class division breaks apart the longer Bertie and Logue are together.  From learning how to operate old elevators by themselves to using first-name introductions, by the end of the 1:50 hour drama there is great respect for royal and commoner and a unity transcends the country at the start of WWII.Both King and commoner remained friends for life until their deaths in 1952.Well- acted, well-written and well-directed, this is a must see for all movie lovers, historians, and even for those who feel they have a stress-induced stammer.  There are several scenes where the King yells out a string of obscenities (which several reviewers gave one-star ratings for) but the obscenities are part of the story.",5,Well-deserved Oscars,1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,2628,"['do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'review', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'due', 'historical', 'drama', 'screenplay', 'had', 'bite', 'when', 'was', 'offered', 'Vine', 'program', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'waited', 'see.Opening', 'closing', 'Wembley', 'expedition', 'speech', 'Duke', 'York', 'first', 'dreaded', 'public', 'speech', 'broadcasted', 'radio', 'determined', 'duke', 'wife', 'seek', 'ways', 'cure', 'stammer', 'seriousness', 'stammer', 'never', 'truly', 'depicted', 'here', 'movie', 'soon', 'viewer', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'movie', 'stammering', 'duke', 'trust', 'loyalty', 'friendship', 'commoner', 'monarch', 'love', 'husband', 'wife', 'father', 'children', 'British', 'people', 'king.Colin', 'Firth', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'received', 'Oscars', 'nominations', 'performance', 'movie', 'Firth', 'won', 'best', 'actor', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'acted', 'parts', 'quite', 'well', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'duchess', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'older', 'prince', 'brother', 'Edward', 'VIII.The', 'duchess', 'one', 'who', 'help', 'Mr', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'famed', 'speech', 'therapist', 'Australia', 'commoner', 'who', 'own', 'consultation', 'office', 'away', 'Buckinham', 'Castle', 'other', 'more', 'royal', 'hangouts', 'dungeon', 'office', 'where', 'most', 'unconventional', 'speech', 'training', 'place', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'Logue', 'see', 'most', 'Bertie', 'future', 'king', 'called', 'Logue', 'stammer', 'due', 'stress', 'being', 'royal', 'prince', 'who', 'was', 'heavily', 'teased', 'brother', 'stammer.Prince', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'abdicate', 'late', '1936', 'marry', 'sweetheart', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'Duke', 'now', 'pushed', 'front', 'royal', 'line', 'not', 'ready', 'clearly', 'stammer', 'worse', 'thought', 'being', 'next', 'king', 'strikes', 'fear', 'heart', 'king', 'fear', 'persistence', 'patience', 'humor', 'therapit', 'Logue.Class', 'division', 'breaks', 'apart', 'longer', 'Bertie', 'Logue', 'are', 'together', 'learning', 'how', 'operate', 'old', 'elevators', 'using', 'first-name', 'introductions', 'end', '1:50', 'hour', 'drama', 'great', 'respect', 'royal', 'commoner', 'unity', 'country', 'start', 'WWII.Both', 'King', 'commoner', 'remained', 'friends', 'life', 'deaths', '1952.Well-', 'acted', 'well-written', 'well-directed', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'lovers', 'historians', 'even', 'who', 'feel', 'have', 'stress-induced', 'stammer', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'King', 'out', 'string', 'obscenities', 'several', 'reviewers', 'gave', 'one-star', 'ratings', 'obscenities', 'are', 'part', 'story']",N/A

1364888,A1M39P7MO277FV,B003UESJH4,Chinmay Hota,"[2, 2]","A troubled childhood leaves the prince a stutterer, but nothing worse. He grows up to be a normal adult, a loving husband and father, and what is more, an intelligent royal with adequate understanding of the role of royalty in politics.As a child the prince was being pinched by the nanny when presented before his parents, the King and the Queen of England, to show him in bad light. He also experienced his younger brother's long illness and subsequent death, and was made to undergo excruciating pain on account of the steel braces he had to wear to set right his knock knees. A very dominating father and a bully of an elder brother completed the picture of the young prince's growing up woes and erosion of self confidence.It takes someone with a deep understanding of human nature to bring to the surface these early life episodes and to show them as the contributing factors for the Prince's speech impairment. The plot of the movie revolves around the lively tussle between the so called speech therapist, Dr Logue (Geoffrey Rush), without a formal medical education and the blue blood (Colin Firth), who finds it very difficult to shed his royal pomposity to accept the therapist as an equal. These moments of vacillation by the prince on the face of contrived provocation by the therapist, gives the movie its high points. Logue shows remarkable sangfroid in his moments of dejection and humiliation. The scene at Westminster Abbey on the eve of the coronation of the Prince as King George VI brings out the best in both Firth and Rush, who play out a protracted duel as vexation, anger and snobbery get a free flow. In the end the duel turns out to be the personal triumph for both the contestants, as both of them overcome great challenges.I had started watching the movie with great hesitation, as I thought stammer is too insignificant a subject to knit a story around. But my fear was short lived because soon I discovered that stammer was just a peg on which hangs a great tale of trust, friendship, and of psychological triumph.As to whether these factors are good enough to bring the movie all the Oscars it won, in the face of stiff competition from other good movies of the year, I have my own doubts. But then Oscar always loves the high and mighty.Chinmay HotaAuthor of Hits and Misses",4,Triumph of Will,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,2307,"['troubled', 'childhood', 'prince', 'stutterer', 'nothing', 'worse', 'up', 'be', 'normal', 'adult', 'loving', 'husband', 'father', 'what', 'more', 'intelligent', 'royal', 'adequate', 'understanding', 'role', 'royalty', 'politics.As', 'child', 'prince', 'was', 'being', 'pinched', 'nanny', 'when', 'presented', 'parents', 'King', 'Queen', 'England', 'show', 'bad', 'light', 'also', 'experienced', 'younger', 'brother', 'long', 'illness', 'subsequent', 'death', 'was', 'made', 'undergo', 'excruciating', 'pain', 'account', 'steel', 'braces', 'had', 'wear', 'set', 'right', 'knock', 'knees', 'very', 'dominating', 'father', 'bully', 'elder', 'brother', 'completed', 'picture', 'young', 'prince', 'growing', 'up', 'woes', 'erosion', 'self', 'confidence.It', 'someone', 'deep', 'understanding', 'human', 'nature', 'bring', 'surface', 'early', 'life', 'episodes', 'show', 'contributing', 'factors', 'Prince', 'speech', 'impairment', 'plot', 'movie', 'lively', 'tussle', 'so', 'called', 'speech', 'therapist', 'Dr', 'Logue', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'formal', 'medical', 'education', 'blue', 'blood', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'who', 'very', 'difficult', 'shed', 'royal', 'pomposity', 'accept', 'therapist', 'equal', 'moments', 'vacillation', 'prince', 'face', 'contrived', 'provocation', 'therapist', 'movie', 'high', 'points', 'Logue', 'remarkable', 'sangfroid', 'moments', 'dejection', 'humiliation', 'scene', 'Westminster', 'Abbey', 'eve', 'coronation', 'Prince', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'out', 'best', 'Firth', 'Rush', 'who', 'play', 'out', 'protracted', 'duel', 'vexation', 'anger', 'snobbery', 'get', 'free', 'flow', 'end', 'duel', 'out', 'be', 'personal', 'triumph', 'contestants', 'overcome', 'great', 'challenges.I', 'had', 'started', 'watching', 'movie', 'great', 'hesitation', 'thought', 'stammer', 'too', 'insignificant', 'subject', 'knit', 'story', 'around', 'fear', 'was', 'short', 'lived', 'soon', 'discovered', 'stammer', 'was', 'just', 'peg', 'great', 'tale', 'trust', 'friendship', 'psychological', 'triumph.As', 'factors', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'bring', 'movie', 'Oscars', 'won', 'face', 'stiff', 'competition', 'other', 'good', 'movies', 'year', 'have', 'own', 'doubts', 'then', 'Oscar', 'always', 'high', 'mighty.Chinmay', 'HotaAuthor', 'Hits', 'Misses']",N/A
1364889,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003UESJH4,Chris Pandolfi,"[11, 14]","""The King's Speech"" is the one of the few films I know of to humanize the embarrassment of stuttering. It tells the story of Prince Albert, Duke of York, who, following the death of his father and the resignation of his older brother, became King George VI and had the unenviable task of leading England and its many colonies into World War II; although he had a voice and had plenty to say, his debilitating stammer made it virtually impossible to actually say it. Imagine what that must be like. You're a public figure, your country is on the brink of war, and the frightened masses long for your words to comfort and guide them - but you have not yet mastered the skill of getting those words out. Your mouth gets in the way of your brain, and what's worse, it's at a time when it's most inconvenient.There's a moment late in the film when Albert, known to his family as Bertie (Colin Firth), watches newsreel footage of Adolph Hitler addressing the Nazis: ""What is he saying?"" asks one of his daughters. ""I don't know,"" he answers slowly and deliberately, ""but ... he seems to be saying it rather well."" When the film begins, it's 1925, and Bertie fails miserably at delivering a speech to close the British Empire Exhibition; from that, it's easy to understand his frustration, dread, and shame, knowing he was teased as a child, knowing his nanny favored his brother, knowing his father's inability to comprehend, knowing every single certified speech therapist in London failed to relieve him of his stutter. So then it's understandable that he would eventually admire Hitler's speaking voice. He was an evil man, but boy, when he spoke, his voice rang loud and clear.Bertie's story begins when he was still a Duke. In the mid 1930s, desperate to get her husband help, the future Queen Mother Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) happens upon Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a speech therapist and failed actor from Australia who loves performing Shakespeare in front of his family - in all likelihood because of the flowing, eloquent language. He's not like the other speech therapists. He makes the rules. He insists that he and his clients be treated equally, which is why he addresses the Duke as Bertie rather than Your Highness. He wants to be called Lionel, not Doctor. He demands that all sessions be held not in Bertie's estate, but in his own office, which, in its dinginess, takes on an oddly organic quality that suits his profession. He's witty and isn't afraid to show it, not even in front of royalty. Elizabeth, while unaccustomed to eccentric commoners, is willing to comply for the sake of her husband.And so begins Bertie's speech therapy, an unconventional routine of diaphragm exercises, tongue and jaw techniques, and memorization of tongue twisters. But this is not merely a clinical series of activities; over time, a friendship grows between the two, one that enables Bertie to try a little harder, even in desperate situations. When he puts on headphones and listens to music, for example, he's able to recite a Shakespeare soliloquy without stammering. How is this possible? It's a matter of distraction; with his attention focused away from the fact that he's speaking, he can go from start to finish almost completely unhindered.But how can he speak with any degree of confidence knowing the crown would soon be on his head? He never wanted to be king; he was a naval officer and a prince. Following the death of his father, George V (Michael Gambon), the next in line for the throne was his brother, Edward (Guy Pearce), but he abdicated in order to be with the woman he loved - a twice divorced American socialite named Wallis Simpson (Eve Best). Elizabeth sensed this in Edward, which is why she sought out Lionel in the first place. If her husband was to be king, and if this meant addressing the people on a regular basis, it would be necessary for him to treat his stammer and conquer his fear of public speaking. Everything leads up to the fall of 1939, at which point Bertie, as George VI, must announce over the radio that England is at war with Germany.Firth's portrayal is extraordinary. Watching him, we don't see a prince or a king; we see a man who wants to be heard. We may also marvel at his ability to stutter, which isn't at all easy to mimic convincingly. Credit also to Carter, who lends a quiet but nonetheless wonderful air of caring and sympathy to her role. On the basis of this portrayal, it's no wonder that the Queen Mother was one of the most beloved royal figures of the last century. And as for Rush, he finds the right balance between humor and heart in his depiction of Lionel. He may crack a few too many jokes, but he is a person with feelings, and it's clear that he cares deeply for his wife and children. ""The King's Speech"" is an absorbing, touching, inspirational film, and is definitely one of the year's best.

And I'd imagine they are far, far worse if you're the titular leader of 1/4 of the world. That's the situation faced by King George VI in The King's Speech.George VI (Colin Firth), called ""Bertie"" through most of the film, was never meant to be king. His brother, David, was the one who was meant to be king, but no one, including his father, seemed to feel he was up to the task. Everyone seemed to have the opinion that Bertie would at least be there to advise the king and would hopefully help him to be better. This all changed when David, who came to the throne as Edward VIII, abdicated to be with the woman he loved, thus making Bertie king. This was something of a problem for young Bertie on several levels, not the least of which was the fact that he had a severe speech impediment.That impediment is the focus of this film. We see the future king and his wife (Helena Bohnam Carter), reaching their wit's end in trying to get help to correct his problems. Out of desperation, she seeks out an Australian actor/speech therapist (Geoffrey Rush). He's a man of extraordinary methods and boldly claims that he can cure the problem. Eventually, through a mix of psychology and friendship, he's able to make very real progress.This is one of those great English movies that uses their unique institution of royalty and uses it well. Much like The Queen, which focused on George VI's daughter, we see a fairly dysfunctional family that's lead by someone who, in theory, wields tremendous power but by law has that power severely limited. It makes for great, quiet drama and more than a little humor, particularly in what I shall refer to as ""the Tourette's scene"".And speaking of that... this movie is rated R. It's got that rating because of two scenes where there's a copious amount of swearing. This is flat-out stupid. It should have been rated PG13 with a warning about the language. There is nothing, nothing at all, that makes this a film that's inappropriate for anyone above the age of ten or so, but since the MPAA is what it is, it got an R rating. Stupid.This is one of those movies that can't really be improved, except perhaps with a somewhat longer run-time. I liked it and I would have liked to have seen more of it. It's easily the second best film of the year, and will likely earn Oscars for Firth, Rush and Carter.

1364893,ACJVGDN8G386P,B003UESJH4,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[1, 1]","About every few years, a performance of exceptional depth, meaning, and transcendence crosses film and television screens, hopefully reminding us how powerful the medium can be to show us something about ourselves. Although these exceptional performances often concern historical figures, what they portray is the very human side of people we think of as being nearly timeless. Some which come to mind include Vivian Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, Glenda Jackson as Queen Elizabeth I, Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, Sean Penn as Harvey Milk, Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin, Helen Mirren as Elizabeth II, Paul Giamatti as John Adams, and Denzel Washington as Malcolm X. In 2010, this honor has to belong to Colin Firth as King George VI in ""The King's Speech"".The reason I believe ""The King's Speech"" is the best picture along with the best performance of 2010 lies not exclusively with Firth's outstanding performance as King George VI, which is exemplary by any standard. The whole tone and atmosphere of the King's Speech is about the English monarchy revealed. Within the high palace walls and glorious banners which have flown for centuries reside fallible human beings. These people, despite the limos and the embroidered ermine, have the same hopes, fears, challenges, and shortcomings which we all share. This film is about one of those born into what seems, from the outside, a life of pure splendor and privilege, and how that person had to cope with very serious shortcomings considering his position in British society.When he is born the second son of the man who would become King George V, it was understood that Bertie would never become King of Great Britain. His brother Edward was the heir presumptive and remained so until the mid-1930's. Bertie (Colin Firth), since early life, had a stammer (or stutter) while speaking, particularly in public situations. As I don't know this history, it sounds like his stammer wasn't taken so seriously because he would never be seated on the throne. But after a disastrous public-speaking engagement at Wembley Stadium in the 1920's, he seeks professional help. His wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) comes across a reputed speech therapist Lionel Logue (Jeffrey Rush in an equally compelling performance) who helped impaired World War I veterans regain their voices. Logue is a kind of real-life Professor Higgins (Pygmalion/My Fair Lady), although his intent is to help those with speech impediments.At first, Bertie wishes only to work on the physical aspects of speech with his new therapist. Logue agrees, provided their relationship is equal behind closed doors. The two work intensely every day to help the future monarch loosen his jaw, enunciate, and breathe more properly. But as the sessions progress and Logue learns more about his high-ranking client/patient, a deeper relationship emerges. And we begin to learn that Bertie did experience ill-treatment as a child which contributed to his stammer. The therapist realizes there is more to Bertie's stammer than mere physical defects.When his brother abdicates the throne in 1936, suddenly Bertie becomes George VI, King of England and Britain. I think George VI is one of the unsung heroes of World War II, often overshadowed by Churchill, Roosevelt and de Gaulle. Although he may have not engaged in a great act of heroism on the field, his willingness to improve himself because of his obligations as Britain's Head of State is a courageous act. His ability to communicate will become the voice of reassurance and resolve among the English-speaking world along with Churchill and Roosevelt against the fascist forces in Europe. A very slow but deliberate transformation occurs throughout the film in which Bertie is at first shy and nervous until he exceeds even his own expectations and becomes worthy to fill the shoes of those before him, worn by the likes of Queen Elizabeth I, King Charles II, Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, and his father King George V.A president doesn't exactly become president when he swears his oath of office, nor a king when he is crowned. These people become fused with their roles when they rise above their deficiencies and face their obstacles head on. As the man who wasn't supposed to be king, George VI rose to the occasion, shortcomings and all. At one point, his speech therapist says ""You're the most courageous man I know."" And that is the mark of a great man, king or otherwise.",5,The Man Who Wouldn't be King Earns the Right to Wear the Crown,1296950400,"02 6, 2011",2011,4432,"['few', 'years', 'performance', 'exceptional', 'depth', 'meaning', 'transcendence', 'crosses', 'film', 'television', 'screens', 'hopefully', 'reminding', 'how', 'powerful', 'medium', 'can', 'be', 'show', 'something', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'often', 'concern', 'historical', 'figures', 'what', 'portray', 'very', 'human', 'side', 'people', 'think', 'being', 'nearly', 'timeless', 'come', 'mind', 'include', 'Vivian', 'Leigh', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Gandhi', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'John', 'Adams', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Malcolm', 'X', '2010', 'honor', 'belong', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'King', 'Speech', '.The', 'reason', 'believe', 'King', 'Speech', 'best', 'picture', 'best', 'performance', '2010', 'not', 'exclusively', 'Firth', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'exemplary', 'standard', 'whole', 'tone', 'atmosphere', 'King', 'Speech', 'English', 'monarchy', 'revealed', 'high', 'palace', 'walls', 'glorious', 'banners', 'have', 'flown', 'centuries', 'reside', 'fallible', 'human', 'beings', 'people', 'limos', 'embroidered', 'ermine', 'have', 'same', 'hopes', 'fears', 'challenges', 'shortcomings', 'share', 'film', 'one', 'born', 'what', 'outside', 'life', 'pure', 'splendor', 'privilege', 'how', 'person', 'had', 'cope', 'very', 'serious', 'shortcomings', 'considering', 'position', 'British', 'society.When', 'born', 'second', 'son', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'was', 'understood', 'Bertie', 'would', 'never', 'become', 'King', 'Great', 'Britain', 'brother', 'Edward', 'was', 'heir', 'presumptive', 'remained', 'so', 'mid-1930', 'Bertie', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'early', 'life', 'had', 'stammer', 'stutter', 'speaking', 'particularly', 'public', 'situations', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'history', 'stammer', 'was', ""n't"", 'taken', 'so', 'seriously', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'seated', 'throne', 'disastrous', 'public-speaking', 'engagement', 'Wembley', 'Stadium', '1920', 'professional', 'help', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'reputed', 'speech', 'therapist', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'Jeffrey', 'Rush', 'equally', 'compelling', 'performance', 'who', 'helped', 'impaired', 'World', 'War', 'veterans', 'regain', 'voices', 'Logue', 'kind', 'real-life', 'Professor', 'Higgins', 'Pygmalion/My', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'intent', 'help', 'speech', 'impediments.At', 'first', 'Bertie', 'only', 'work', 'physical', 'aspects', 'speech', 'new', 'therapist', 'Logue', 'provided', 'relationship', 'equal', 'closed', 'doors', 'two', 'work', 'intensely', 'day', 'help', 'future', 'monarch', 'loosen', 'jaw', 'enunciate', 'breathe', 'more', 'properly', 'sessions', 'progress', 'Logue', 'more', 'high-ranking', 'client/patient', 'deeper', 'relationship', 'begin', 'learn', 'Bertie', 'did', 'experience', 'ill-treatment', 'child', 'contributed', 'stammer', 'therapist', 'realizes', 'more', 'Bertie', 'stammer', 'mere', 'physical', 'defects.When', 'brother', 'throne', '1936', 'suddenly', 'Bertie', 'George', 'VI', 'King', 'England', 'Britain', 'think', 'George', 'VI', 'one', 'unsung', 'heroes', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'often', 'overshadowed', 'Churchill', 'Roosevelt', 'de', 'Gaulle', 'may', 'have', 'not', 'engaged', 'great', 'act', 'heroism', 'field', 'willingness', 'improve', 'obligations', 'Britain', 'Head', 'State', 'courageous', 'act', 'ability', 'communicate', 'will', 'become', 'voice', 'reassurance', 'resolve', 'English-speaking', 'world', 'Churchill', 'Roosevelt', 'fascist', 'forces', 'Europe', 'very', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'transformation', 'film', 'Bertie', 'first', 'shy', 'nervous', 'even', 'own', 'expectations', 'worthy', 'fill', 'shoes', 'worn', 'likes', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'King', 'Charles', 'II', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'King', 'Edward', 'VII', 'father', 'King', 'George', 'V.A', 'president', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'become', 'president', 'when', 'oath', 'office', 'king', 'when', 'crowned', 'people', 'become', 'fused', 'roles', 'when', 'rise', 'deficiencies', 'face', 'obstacles', 'head', 'man', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'king', 'George', 'VI', 'rose', 'occasion', 'shortcomings', 'one', 'point', 'speech', 'therapist', ""'re"", 'most', 'courageous', 'man', 'know', 'mark', 'great', 'man', 'king', 'otherwise']",N/A

I really didn't expect to love it as much as I did as I thought it would be boring. But the fantastic acting made it anything but.I have always liked Colin Firth and he does not disappoint in this movie. But Geoffrey Rush is absolutely absolutely phenomenal. Helena Bonham Carter is great too as Firth's supportive, loving but slightly arrogant wife, the late Queen Mother.In a nutshell, the movie is about Prince Albert, the Duke of York, who unexpectantly is forced to take the throne when his father, King George V, dies and his older brother abdicates. But King George VI (Bertie to those close to him) has a bad stammer which he developed at the age of four and has tried to overcome to no avail. After his older brother chooses an inappropriate romance over the throne, Bertie is forced to become the next King. His stammer and hatred of public speaking prompts his wife to find him a very different type of speech therapist, Lionel Logue played brilliantly by Geoffrey Rush, who despite lacking the paper credentials, assists King George VI in overcoming his stammer with very unorthodox methods.Bertie and the eccentric and somewhat irreverant Lionel begin to work together on the King's stammer and develop a life long friendship in the process, despite their very different social classes. The interplay between them is wonderful, humorous, and heartwarming. Colin Firth as the tormented class-conscious very serious king versus Lionel, an unemployed actor turned speech therapist who works hard to lighten the king up. Rush was superb!The cast includes Michael Gambon as King George V, Guy Pearce as the lovelorn shortlived King Edward VIII, Timoty Spall once again as Winston Churchill, Claire Bloom as Queen Mary, Derek Jacobi as Archbishop Cosmo Lang, Jennifer Ehle as Lionel Logue's wife, Anthony Andrews as Stanley Baldwin, and Roger Parrott as Neville Chamberlain.As I said earlier, ""The King's Speech"" is heartwarming, humorous, captivating, compelling, emotional, truly memorable.",5,"If there were a six star category, I would choose it",1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,2411,"['am', 'not', 'big', 'history', 'buff', 'Wish', 'were', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'retain', 'dates', 'names', 'etc', 'had', 'movie', 'awhile', 'waiting', 'right', 'time', 'watch', 'was', 'other', 'night', 'group', 'friends', 'vacation', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'prompted', 'get', 'Queen', 'Mrs', 'Brown', 'next', 'day', 'King', 'Speech', 'heartwarming', 'humorous', 'captivating', 'compelling', 'emotional', 'truly', 'memorable', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'boring', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'made', 'anything', 'but.I', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'not', 'disappoint', 'movie', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'absolutely', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'great', 'too', 'Firth', 'supportive', 'loving', 'slightly', 'arrogant', 'wife', 'late', 'Queen', 'Mother.In', 'nutshell', 'movie', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'Duke', 'York', 'who', 'unexpectantly', 'forced', 'take', 'throne', 'when', 'father', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'dies', 'older', 'brother', 'abdicates', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'Bertie', 'close', 'bad', 'stammer', 'developed', 'age', 'four', 'tried', 'overcome', 'avail', 'older', 'brother', 'inappropriate', 'romance', 'throne', 'Bertie', 'forced', 'become', 'next', 'King', 'stammer', 'hatred', 'public', 'speaking', 'prompts', 'wife', 'find', 'very', 'different', 'type', 'speech', 'therapist', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'who', 'lacking', 'paper', 'credentials', 'assists', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'overcoming', 'stammer', 'very', 'unorthodox', 'methods.Bertie', 'eccentric', 'somewhat', 'irreverant', 'Lionel', 'begin', 'work', 'together', 'King', 'stammer', 'develop', 'life', 'long', 'friendship', 'process', 'very', 'different', 'social', 'classes', 'interplay', 'wonderful', 'humorous', 'heartwarming', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'tormented', 'class-conscious', 'very', 'serious', 'king', 'versus', 'Lionel', 'unemployed', 'actor', 'turned', 'speech', 'therapist', 'who', 'hard', 'lighten', 'king', 'up', 'Rush', 'was', 'superb', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'lovelorn', 'shortlived', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'Timoty', 'Spall', 'once', 'again', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Archbishop', 'Cosmo', 'Lang', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'wife', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'Stanley', 'Baldwin', 'Roger', 'Parrott', 'Neville', 'Chamberlain.As', 'said', 'earlier', 'King', 'Speech', 'heartwarming', 'humorous', 'captivating', 'compelling', 'emotional', 'truly', 'memorable']",N/A

There is only one problem-he has stammered his whole life. It embarrasses and frustrates him.The movie opens in the 1920's. He is asked to give a speech at the closing of the English Exhibition. He can barley get through it though because he stammers so much.Over the years he goes through many therapies to try to cure him of his stammer (including smoking, which kills him)After another unsuccessful therapy session he tells his wife Elizabeth (the Queen Mum) that he does not want to go threw that again. Not heeding her husbands demand she gets the name of Lionel Logue, a speech therapist from Australia.Using some unconventional methods of therapy the two become friends. Logue helps Bertie (the Duke's nickname) when it becomes apparent that his elder brother David or Edward VIII will abdicate to marry his mistress Wallis Simpson.In the end Bertie becomes King George VI and must make a speech when it becomes evident that Hitler wants a war. Logue comes to the Palace to help George practice it and later stands beside him as he gives the speech.Overall a great movie. Colin Firth did a great job as Bertie, and deserved the Oscar he got.

1364904,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B003UESJH4,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[4, 5]","On the face of it, the premise for this film shouldn't make a great film. Summarize this as the runner-up for the King of England(Prince George) has an impossible stutter and his wife (Princess Elizabeth) encourages the reluctant prince to seek help from a failed actor/self-identified speech therapist named Lionel Logue. However, when you put this story within the context of a couple larger occurences of monumental importance this film comes together.In the background is the soon-to-be crowned King (Edward VIII) who gives up his kingdom 'for the woman I love' and the emerging threat of Adolph Hitler and the Nazi Party. Suddenly the need for a leader who can inspire the confidence of his countrymen becomes important.This film works slowly in setting its groundwork with brilliant performances by Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and Helena Bonham-Carter and a sharp script that progresses the plot as it involves the viewer in the personal story as well as the bigger story. The dynamic between the prince(Firth) and Logue(Rush) as their characters' relationship develops makes this match almost as interesting as the one forged between Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan. I appreciated the strong sense of the historic dynamic being blended with the simple story of a stutterer. While the Duke of Windsor has always been a figure of much speculation, this puts a face on the 'default' king and possibly explains why even today the English puts so much stock in having a figurehead royal family.Overall, this is a great movie which has a strong script, great performances, beautiful photography, and an overall vintage feel to it that puts it into historic perspective.",5,An Improbable Premise For A Monumental Movie,1303171200,"04 19, 2011",2011,1670,"['face', 'premise', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'make', 'great', 'film', 'Summarize', 'runner-up', 'King', 'England', 'Prince', 'George', 'impossible', 'stutter', 'wife', 'Princess', 'Elizabeth', 'reluctant', 'prince', 'seek', 'help', 'failed', 'actor/self-identified', 'speech', 'therapist', 'named', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'However', 'when', 'put', 'story', 'context', 'couple', 'larger', 'occurences', 'monumental', 'importance', 'film', 'together.In', 'background', 'soon-to-be', 'crowned', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'who', 'up', 'kingdom', 'woman', 'love', 'emerging', 'threat', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'Suddenly', 'need', 'leader', 'who', 'can', 'inspire', 'confidence', 'countrymen', 'important.This', 'film', 'slowly', 'setting', 'groundwork', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'sharp', 'script', 'plot', 'viewer', 'personal', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'bigger', 'story', 'dynamic', 'prince', 'Firth', 'Logue', 'Rush', 'characters', 'relationship', 'match', 'almost', 'as', 'interesting', 'one', 'forged', 'Helen', 'Keller', 'Annie', 'Sullivan', 'appreciated', 'strong', 'sense', 'historic', 'dynamic', 'being', 'blended', 'simple', 'story', 'stutterer', 'Duke', 'Windsor', 'always', 'been', 'figure', 'much', 'speculation', 'face', ""'default"", 'king', 'possibly', 'why', 'even', 'today', 'English', 'so', 'much', 'stock', 'having', 'figurehead', 'royal', 'family.Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'strong', 'script', 'great', 'performances', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'overall', 'vintage', 'feel', 'historic', 'perspective']",N/A
1364905,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B003UESJH4,Craig MACKINNON,"[1, 1]","I have to admit to being a sucker for these kinds of historical dramas, and for the period in which this one takes place (the eve of World War II).  For those that don't know the history, a brief synopsis is this: The old king (George V) is dies leaving his eldest son Prince David as the new king (becoming Edward VIII).  Unfortunately, all David wishes to do is hold hedonistic parties with his twice-divorced girlfriend Wallis Simpson.  When he finally decides to marry her, he must abdicate (the constitution then did not allow marriage to a divorcee), bringing Prince Abert.  Because he was the second son, ""Bertie"" had no expectation of becoming king - a good thing too, because he had a terrible stutter and really, the main duty of a constitutional monarch is to serve as a neutral (apolitical) figurehead around whom a nation can rally in times of joy, sorrow, or crisis.  As such, his only real duty is talking to people and speech-giving, obviously not a forte for a stutterer!The film starts well before this, at Prince Albert's first formal/official speech, closing the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium, also being broadcast to the colonies.  At a time when the British Empire encompassed 1/4 of the world's population, this was a large audience.  Thus we have a growing crisis at home (Edward VIII's dalliances) coupled with one abroad (the rise of Germany and Hitler) at a time when the British monarchy is itself in trouble.  This is certainly ample fodder for an historical drama, and the world events and context of the film's story is always kept alive through judicious use of newsreel footage, overheard radio news broadcasts, etc.But, of course, this is film is not a history of the British monarchy through the depression years.  No, this is a personal journey of discovery and healing (if treating a stammer can be termed as such), which depends vitally on the principle actors and the screenplay.  Into Bertie's dry and officious world enters Lionel Logue - an unapologetic Aussie speech therapist with unofficial credentials and unorthodox methods.  The story is remarkably moving, funny, and engaging, given the subject matter.  Bertie and Lionel both have subtle yet smart senses of humour, and the interplay between them is a joy to watch.  Obviously the casting is essential here, and both Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are fantastic in the roles.  One of the extras on the DVD (at least, the version I have - which might be different than the one offered on Amazon, based on the disc's description) is a recording of the actual George VI speech that is recreated at the end of the film. It's to Firth's credit that he sounds exactly like the real King in intonation, pacing, etc. (his voice may be a little deeper, but never mind).  This is the first, most obvious observation in watching the actors - they are technically great (Michael Gambon's Churchill is also remarkable - although the film portrays his and George VI's interactions as more friendly than they likely were).  Little is known of Lionel, but Geoffrey Rush, being Australian and a fantastic actor, certainly brings Lionel to life.For me, though, the trickiest and most successful acting in the film is by Helena Bonham Carter.  She plays the woman who became the Queen Mother, the most-loved royal over the last 50 years of her life, a Queen who will be a living memory for most people watching the film (she died in 2002), and a woman well-known to have a sharp wit, a commanding presence, and startling ability to hold her liquor (the last is irrelevant to the story, but is surely one of the traits that added to her popularity as she aged). Bonham Carter plays her part marvellously, as do the two girls playing Lilabet and Margaret (the former now known as Queen Elizabeth II).So, I really enjoyed this film and I'm perfectly happy that it won the Oscar for best picture.  The extras on the DVD are not extensive but are useful - an interview with Lionel's grandson Mark Logue (leeper of his grandfather's diary), the aforementioned speeches of the real George VI, and some other goodies.  So why do I give the film only 4/5?  Well, I reserve 5/5 for films I decide I simply must have because I can't bear the thought of not seeing them again.

The King's Speech is precisely that, and it tackles its difficult task with memorable performances from its cast, breathtaking cinematography, and monumental costume and set designs; sure to be a heavy contender at the Oscars.Colin Firth is rumored to be up for the lead actor category for his portrayal of King George VI, and while I was fonder of his Oscar nominated performance in A Single Man last year; his King George isn't shabby either. He plays a man plagued with the curse of stammering and the dread of being required to speak not only publicly but to several nations at a given time, in more than convincing fashion.Our story is the true one of King George VI as he is to be elected the King after the death of his father, just as England is about to find itself in the hellish midst of World War II. With the support of his wife and children and a single friend, God willing, he will have what it takes to win the hearts of his countrymen when he is to address them via a radio broadcast. This is not a large cinematic plot; but I assure you the filmmakers and actors make it every bit as entertaining and suspenseful as the climax in any sports film or courtroom drama.The single friend George has is a speech therapist named Lionel Logue. Geoffrey Rush plays him, and was the center of my attention throughout the entire film. He's next in line for the supporting Oscar after Christian Bale for The Fighter. Lionel is an Australian man trying to support his family by assisting those with speech impediments, while working on his true passion on the side: stage acting. The future King George VI is his newest client.Lionel's first method of attack at defeating the beast of stammering is to befriend the snooty man of royalty. He attempts to begin this by merely suggesting that he and his client be on a first name basis with one another. So he calls the soon to be King by his common name, Bertie.The meat of this film is comprised of these two fine actors preparing the Bertie character for his speech. Boring as that may sound; these scenes are both hilarious and dramatically compelling and are shot with cinematography that showcases large and elaborate locations similar to those found in classic films.

1364908,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B003UESJH4,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[0, 0]","As a document of a little known history of pre-World War II England, The King's Speech is a fascinating, heart rending dramatization of King George VI, who assumed the throne despite a debilitating speech problem at a time when his country needed him the most.  Well directed by TV veteran Tom Hooper (John Adams) from a lifelong project by screenwriter David Seidler, it boasts Colin Firth's (Bridget Jones Diary, A Single Man) best performance as the beleaguered king and award caliber support by Geoffrey Rush (Shine, Elizabeth) and Helena Bonham Carter (Alice in Wonderland, Room With a View).In 1925, Prince Albert (Colin Firth), who is second in line to the throne, gives a speech through BBC radio at Wembley Stadium in England, and it goes poorly as he hesitates and stumbles his words much to the astonishment of the crowd.  He has a stuttering problem that is revealed in the most public and humiliating way.  By the 1930's in London, Albert is subjected to a multitude of therapies and remedies that range from speaking with a mouthful of marbles to smoking!  His frustration grows until he abandons any hope of solving his affliction.  His wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), seeks out an obscure, Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), who feels confident he can cure the prince.  A struggling actor himself, Logue has a playful sense of humor that does not ingratiate himself with the future King of England.  It is a humbling process, but he slowly brings the prince out of his timid and isolated shell.  They work on a progression of methods which includes utilizing recordings and headphones and delves into Albert's childhood.  The therapy sessions are not without setbacks but a bond develops into a strong friendship.  As 1936 approaches, King George V dies, and when The Prince of Wales (Guy Pierce) abdicates the throne to be with an American divorcee, the title and responsibility fall on Prince Albert who is desperate not to be placed in this position when England needs a leader.  As the clouds of war approach Europe, Prince Albert is named King George VI on December 12, 1936.  With England on the brink of declaring war on Germany, and a radio broadcast to all of England and the world, George summons Logue to coach him through the most important speech of his life.  With Logue at his side to guide his every word, George speaks to the nation.Hooper does a very straightforward job without having to resort to flashy camerawork but instead lets his actors do what they do best-act!  This long gestating screenplay started with Seidler as a child stutterer listening to radio broadcasts of the king, and it was not until his widow, the Queen Mother, died that he had her conditional consent to tackle the story.  It does play a bit with facts but never loses sight of the core relationship of the two disparate men and how a common actor taught a prince to be king. Technical production is excellent all around from the impressive period costumes and art direction to the dramatic score and dark hued cinematography.It is the interplay and war of wills between Firth and Rush that is the delicious center of this relationship based story.  Reunited after having costarred in Shakespeare in Love, both actors are at the top of their game, and part of the fun is that despite the seriousness of the therapy, there are humorous moments to savor.  Carter plays `less is more' in one of her more conventional roles, and she is quite convincing as royalty.  Some nice turns are made by acting royalty, Michael Gambon, Guy Pierce, Derek Jacobi, and Claire Bloom among others.The story adds texture in the family details by revealing George V as a domineering father.  The troubles of George VI are shown in intimate scenes with his children as he tries to read a story but is handicapped by his impediment.  The documentary footage of Hitler's mastery of public speaking is studied with fascination and almost envy by George.  It is an ironic yet telling scene.  Logue adores his own family, and his down to earth persona is in sharp contrast to George VI's more formal yet heartfelt affections for his family.  There is a good contrast made of the King's life from that of the common man.  In the scene where George VI is crowned King, he must address his court and realizes that everyone, even his own family, will now treat him differently.  Life will never be the same again.  When George VI makes his speech at the end, we see that he is learning to be a king.As a piece of history, The King's Speech is thoroughly engaging, but what makes it affecting is one man's triumph over adversity with the support of a loving wife and the friendship of a unique therapist.",5,The Majestic Roar of THE KING'S SPEECH,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,4716,"['document', 'little', 'known', 'history', 'pre-World', 'War', 'II', 'England', 'King', 'Speech', 'fascinating', 'heart', 'rending', 'dramatization', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'who', 'assumed', 'throne', 'debilitating', 'speech', 'problem', 'time', 'when', 'country', 'needed', 'most', 'Well', 'directed', 'TV', 'veteran', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'John', 'Adams', 'lifelong', 'project', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Seidler', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'A', 'Single', 'Man', 'best', 'performance', 'beleaguered', 'king', 'award', 'caliber', 'support', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Shine', 'Elizabeth', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'Room', 'View', '.In', '1925', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'who', 'second', 'line', 'throne', 'speech', 'BBC', 'radio', 'Wembley', 'Stadium', 'England', 'poorly', 'words', 'much', 'astonishment', 'crowd', 'stuttering', 'problem', 'revealed', 'most', 'public', 'humiliating', 'way', '1930', 'London', 'Albert', 'subjected', 'multitude', 'therapies', 'remedies', 'range', 'speaking', 'mouthful', 'marbles', 'smoking', 'frustration', 'hope', 'solving', 'affliction', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'out', 'obscure', 'Australian', 'speech', 'therapist', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'who', 'confident', 'can', 'cure', 'prince', 'struggling', 'actor', 'Logue', 'playful', 'sense', 'humor', 'not', 'ingratiate', 'future', 'King', 'England', 'humbling', 'process', 'slowly', 'prince', 'timid', 'isolated', 'shell', 'work', 'progression', 'methods', 'utilizing', 'recordings', 'headphones', 'Albert', 'childhood', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'are', 'not', 'setbacks', 'bond', 'strong', 'friendship', '1936', 'approaches', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'when', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'throne', 'be', 'American', 'divorcee', 'title', 'responsibility', 'fall', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'who', 'desperate', 'not', 'be', 'placed', 'position', 'when', 'England', 'leader', 'clouds', 'war', 'approach', 'Europe', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'named', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'December', '12', '1936', 'England', 'brink', 'declaring', 'war', 'Germany', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'England', 'world', 'George', 'summons', 'Logue', 'coach', 'most', 'important', 'speech', 'life', 'Logue', 'side', 'guide', 'word', 'George', 'nation.Hooper', 'very', 'straightforward', 'job', 'having', 'resort', 'flashy', 'camerawork', 'instead', 'actors', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'best-act', 'long', 'gestating', 'screenplay', 'started', 'Seidler', 'child', 'stutterer', 'listening', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'king', 'was', 'not', 'widow', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'died', 'had', 'conditional', 'consent', 'tackle', 'story', 'play', 'bit', 'facts', 'never', 'sight', 'core', 'relationship', 'two', 'disparate', 'men', 'how', 'common', 'actor', 'taught', 'prince', 'be', 'king', 'Technical', 'production', 'excellent', 'all', 'impressive', 'period', 'costumes', 'art', 'direction', 'dramatic', 'score', 'dark', 'hued', 'cinematography.It', 'interplay', 'war', 'wills', 'Firth', 'Rush', 'delicious', 'center', 'relationship', 'based', 'story', 'Reunited', 'having', 'costarred', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'actors', 'are', 'top', 'game', 'part', 'fun', 'seriousness', 'therapy', 'are', 'humorous', 'moments', 'savor', 'Carter', 'less', 'more', 'one', 'more', 'conventional', 'roles', 'quite', 'convincing', 'royalty', 'nice', 'turns', 'are', 'made', 'acting', 'royalty', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'others.The', 'story', 'texture', 'family', 'details', 'revealing', 'George', 'V', 'domineering', 'father', 'troubles', 'George', 'VI', 'are', 'shown', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'children', 'read', 'story', 'handicapped', 'impediment', 'documentary', 'footage', 'Hitler', 'mastery', 'public', 'speaking', 'studied', 'fascination', 'almost', 'envy', 'George', 'ironic', 'yet', 'telling', 'scene', 'Logue', 'own', 'family', 'down', 'earth', 'persona', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'George', 'VI', 'more', 'formal', 'yet', 'heartfelt', 'affections', 'family', 'good', 'contrast', 'made', 'King', 'life', 'common', 'man', 'scene', 'where', 'George', 'VI', 'crowned', 'King', 'must', 'address', 'court', 'everyone', 'even', 'own', 'family', 'will', 'now', 'treat', 'differently', 'Life', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'again', 'When', 'George', 'VI', 'speech', 'end', 'see', 'learning', 'be', 'king.As', 'piece', 'history', 'King', 'Speech', 'thoroughly', 'engaging', 'what', 'affecting', 'one', 'man', 'triumph', 'adversity', 'support', 'loving', 'wife', 'friendship', 'unique', 'therapist']",N/A

To avoid redudancy, I will, therefore,  direct my comments as to how incredibly inspiring a movie this was to me personally trusting that there are many others who feel the same way:Colin Furth's performance as the future King George VI was truly phenomenal.I went to see the film with my husband just two weeks after undergoing major surgery. Although weak and still in some pain I could not help but cheer (from the back row of the theater) at the successes the future King (whom Colin so skillfully portrayed) was able to make to come to grips with a frustrating speech impediment. Furth's performance truly deserved his being awarded the Best Actor Academy Award.As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker myself I cannot help but admire so many individuals in the world who without formal clinical training are able to motivate individuals to ""be the best that they can be."" I was later disappointed that Geoffrey Rush who played the legendary speech therapist Lionel Logue did not also win the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award. He truly deserved it. Logue's own story was so inspirational and should be motivating to all those currently who work with servicemembers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. His ability to help shell shocked Australian soldiers returning from World War I without formal training was something truly to be admired.Also to be most deeply admired is the 73-year-old gentleman who wrote the screenplay (David Seidler).  I especially loved the comment he made at the Academy Awards when he admitted that his mother had once told him that she felt he was ""going to be a late bloomer.""  As a proud Englishman, he respected the wishes of the Queen Mother and waited for some 28 years until she had passed away before he wrote the screenplay for this film. Having had to overcome a speech impediment himself he understood intimately how difficult an achievement that truly was.I will be honored to own a copy of this film ordered from amazon.com and I recommend it to all those who ever had to overcome a disability when the pressure to perform well despite all is so great.",5,"Incredibly moving, extremely motivational , truly a work of art deserving of a Best Picture Academy award.",1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,2184,"['So', 'many', 'great', 'reviews', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'written', 'summarizing', 'contents', 'film', 'avoid', 'redudancy', 'will', 'therefore', 'direct', 'comments', 'how', 'incredibly', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'was', 'personally', 'trusting', 'are', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'Colin', 'Furth', 'performance', 'future', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'was', 'truly', 'phenomenal.I', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'husband', 'just', 'two', 'weeks', 'undergoing', 'major', 'surgery', 'weak', 'still', 'pain', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'cheer', 'back', 'row', 'theater', 'successes', 'future', 'King', 'whom', 'Colin', 'so', 'skillfully', 'portrayed', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'come', 'grips', 'frustrating', 'speech', 'impediment', 'Furth', 'performance', 'truly', 'deserved', 'being', 'awarded', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award.As', 'Licensed', 'Clinical', 'Social', 'Worker', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'admire', 'so', 'many', 'individuals', 'world', 'who', 'formal', 'clinical', 'training', 'are', 'able', 'motivate', 'individuals', 'be', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'was', 'later', 'disappointed', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'who', 'played', 'legendary', 'speech', 'therapist', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'did', 'not', 'also', 'win', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'truly', 'deserved', 'Logue', 'own', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'inspirational', 'should', 'be', 'motivating', 'currently', 'who', 'work', 'servicemembers', 'returning', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'ability', 'help', 'shell', 'shocked', 'Australian', 'soldiers', 'returning', 'World', 'War', 'formal', 'training', 'was', 'something', 'truly', 'be', 'admired.Also', 'be', 'most', 'deeply', 'admired', '73-year-old', 'gentleman', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'David', 'Seidler', 'especially', 'loved', 'comment', 'made', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'when', 'admitted', 'mother', 'had', 'once', 'told', 'felt', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'late', 'bloomer', 'proud', 'Englishman', 'respected', 'wishes', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'waited', '28', 'years', 'had', 'passed', 'away', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'film', 'Having', 'had', 'overcome', 'speech', 'impediment', 'understood', 'intimately', 'how', 'difficult', 'achievement', 'truly', 'was.I', 'will', 'be', 'honored', 'own', 'copy', 'film', 'ordered', 'amazon.com', 'recommend', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'overcome', 'disability', 'when', 'pressure', 'perform', 'well', 'so', 'great']",N/A

1364913,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B003UESJH4,DanD,"[4, 4]","Rarely does film-making come in as solid a package as it does in Tom Hooper's THE KING'S SPEECH.  You have top-notch directing; perfect casting; an engaging script; beautiful cinematography; and a story with a lot of room for emotional interpretation.  It concerns Bertie--soon to be King George VI--and his stammer, and the Australian linguist hired to cure him.What's so surprising about SPEECH is that there's little surprise here; everything is just as you would expect it to be (except for the cursing scenes, which come as a pleasant change of pace).  And yet, the film comes off smoothly, from the stellar lead performances (another fine turn from Colin Firth, and Geoffrey Rush at his best) to the minor roles (a superb Helena Bohnam Carter as the future queen, an under-used Guy Pearce as Bertie's brother, and Michael Gambon as their father).

I thought it was a good story that was well-acted. Every actor was fantastic I'll admit. The plot was solid yet typical. It's based on a true story, so the artistic license didn't have the liberty that some plots enjoy.I felt at times like the story was rushed. I wanted more out of the relationship with the king and the therapist, but at times it felt like we got the Cliff Notes version of their relationship. Plus, I was expecting an overpowering sense of happiness and achievement in the end. A feel good money shot so-to-say. And maybe for some that is what they felt. For me it felt like the emotional fever pitch was taken up to around 70% instead of 100%.

1364917,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B003UESJH4,David A. Wend,"[1, 1]","The King's Speech is equally about Prince Albert's battle with stammering and the friendship between the future King George VI and Lionel Logue.  As with many historical films, the production is wonderful at turning back the clock. The film covers the period from 1926 to 1939, when the King makes the titles speech.  It was interesting to note how frightening it could be to face a microphone with the blinking red light and the instrument itself strung inside a metal frame with springs.  The announcer, at the beginning of the film, preparing himself by gargling, spraying his throat and measuring his distance from the microphone makes it all seem like a chore just to say a few words.The film owes its success to the first rate performances given by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush but there are also equally memorable supporting roles. Guy Pierce fills the role of Edward VIII very ably portraying him to be more of a playboy then a future king. I am sure that many would say this isn't a well-rounded portrait of Edward but what does come across is his dissatisfaction with the protocol and duties that being a future king entailed. Timothy Spall was a good choice to play Winston Churchill and Anthony Andrews, who rarely appears in films, was an excellent Stanley Baldwin. Michel Gambon played George V exactly as I picture him: a cold parent.  Helena Bonham-Carter is well cast as Queen Elizabeth and her acting is flawless but it is a role that focuses on her husband rather than providing depth. Eve Best made an impressive Wallis Simpson even though she only had a brief couple of scenes.  I will remember the party scene when she sends Edward to get a fresh bottle of her favorite champagne.  Derek Jacobi (as the Archbishop of Canterbury) and Claire Bloom (as Queen Mary) were good to see even in such small roles.The screenplay is historically accurate, even down to the use of some private notes kept by Mr. Logue that were found shortly before shooting began. The only fault with events was that Winston Churchill was more of a supporter of Edward and not in favor of abdication and the royal family supported Neville Chamberlain's appeasement policy instead of war. The King's Speech is a film I would like to see again for the inspirational story and also because it is a beautifully made story.",5,Great Film Making,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,2313,"['King', 'Speech', 'equally', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'battle', 'stammering', 'friendship', 'future', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'many', 'historical', 'films', 'production', 'wonderful', 'turning', 'back', 'clock', 'film', 'period', '1926', '1939', 'when', 'King', 'titles', 'speech', 'was', 'interesting', 'note', 'how', 'frightening', 'could', 'be', 'face', 'microphone', 'blinking', 'red', 'light', 'instrument', 'strung', 'metal', 'frame', 'springs', 'announcer', 'beginning', 'film', 'preparing', 'gargling', 'spraying', 'throat', 'measuring', 'distance', 'microphone', 'seem', 'chore', 'just', 'say', 'few', 'words.The', 'film', 'success', 'first', 'rate', 'performances', 'given', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'are', 'also', 'equally', 'memorable', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'role', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'very', 'ably', 'portraying', 'be', 'more', 'playboy', 'then', 'future', 'king', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'would', 'say', ""n't"", 'well-rounded', 'portrait', 'Edward', 'what', 'come', 'across', 'dissatisfaction', 'protocol', 'duties', 'being', 'future', 'king', 'entailed', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'play', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'who', 'rarely', 'films', 'was', 'excellent', 'Stanley', 'Baldwin', 'Michel', 'Gambon', 'played', 'George', 'V', 'exactly', 'picture', 'cold', 'parent', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'well', 'cast', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'acting', 'flawless', 'role', 'husband', 'rather', 'providing', 'depth', 'Eve', 'Best', 'made', 'impressive', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'even', 'only', 'had', 'brief', 'couple', 'scenes', 'will', 'remember', 'party', 'scene', 'when', 'Edward', 'get', 'fresh', 'bottle', 'favorite', 'champagne', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Archbishop', 'Canterbury', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'were', 'good', 'see', 'even', 'such', 'small', 'roles.The', 'screenplay', 'historically', 'accurate', 'even', 'down', 'use', 'private', 'notes', 'kept', 'Mr.', 'Logue', 'were', 'found', 'shortly', 'shooting', 'began', 'only', 'fault', 'events', 'was', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'was', 'more', 'supporter', 'Edward', 'not', 'favor', 'abdication', 'royal', 'family', 'supported', 'Neville', 'Chamberlain', 'appeasement', 'policy', 'instead', 'war', 'King', 'Speech', 'film', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'again', 'inspirational', 'story', 'also', 'beautifully', 'made', 'story']",N/A

I feel honored and privileged to be able to comment on a piece of art that is so majestic.  In my lifetime I can remember few occasions where I was left so entranced and mesmerized after viewing a film.  The other times were the aforementioned ""Raging Bull"" and the others were ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Pulp Fiction"".  I could write paragraph after paragraph about how this film excels on every level so I'll try to nutshell as best as possible.  For starters, Colin Firth is an absolute marvel as the future monarch of Britain.  Some actors would overplay the speech impediment but Firth makes it seem so natural as if he lived with it his whole life.  The stammer is only one aspect of Firth's character.  He's required to exorcise personal demons while tackling a constitutional crisis as well as a forboding war with Germany.  Geoffery Rush may have gotten a supporting actor nod but I found it more of a co-starring performance.  The film resonates with the alchemy between Firth and the benign toughlove approach of Rush's speech therapist.  If you don't believe the role reversal between the king and servant then the film doesn't work but here it's eminently credible.  The ensemble here is impeccable so I don't want to single anyone out.  Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, Michael Gambon, Timothy Spall, Anthony Andrews, Derek Jacobi and even then I believe there's some omissions.  Tom Hooper has ridden to the top of the class as a filmmaker to watch out for.  Stylistically the film reminded me a lot of David Lean .  You are led to believe that you are watching a large scale epic despite the relatively meager budget Hooper had to work with.  Also impressive is David Seidler's screenplay.  The septugenarian Seidler intricately melds the more intimate aspects of the story with the larger scale historical details.  His script is so rich with information that you are left enthralled throughout.  ""The King's Speech"" is that once in a generation film experience that will be savored for ages.  On a totally superfluous note I's like to recommend a couple obscure Colin Firth films, ""Fever Pitch"" and ""Where the Truth Lies"".  The first is a Nick Hornby adaptation and the second is an intriguing Atom Egoyan effort that Firth in interviews cited as one of his personal favorites.",5,I'm Sorry I Missed This One At The Movies,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,2412,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'mince', 'words', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Godfather', 'King', 'Speech', 'good', 'feel', 'honored', 'privileged', 'be', 'able', 'comment', 'piece', 'art', 'so', 'majestic', 'lifetime', 'can', 'remember', 'few', 'occasions', 'where', 'was', 'left', 'so', 'entranced', 'mesmerized', 'viewing', 'film', 'other', 'times', 'were', 'aforementioned', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'others', 'were', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'could', 'write', 'paragraph', 'paragraph', 'how', 'film', 'excels', 'level', 'so', ""'ll"", 'try', 'nutshell', 'as', 'best', 'possible', 'starters', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'absolute', 'marvel', 'future', 'monarch', 'Britain', 'actors', 'would', 'overplay', 'speech', 'impediment', 'Firth', 'seem', 'so', 'natural', 'lived', 'whole', 'life', 'stammer', 'only', 'one', 'aspect', 'Firth', 'character', 'required', 'exorcise', 'personal', 'demons', 'tackling', 'constitutional', 'crisis', 'as', 'well', 'forboding', 'war', 'Germany', 'Geoffery', 'Rush', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'supporting', 'actor', 'nod', 'found', 'more', 'co-starring', 'performance', 'film', 'alchemy', 'Firth', 'benign', 'approach', 'Rush', 'speech', 'therapist', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'role', 'reversal', 'king', 'servant', 'then', 'film', ""n't"", 'work', 'here', 'eminently', 'credible', 'ensemble', 'here', 'impeccable', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'single', 'anyone', 'out', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'even', 'then', 'believe', 'omissions', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'ridden', 'top', 'class', 'filmmaker', 'watch', 'out', 'Stylistically', 'film', 'reminded', 'lot', 'David', 'Lean', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'are', 'watching', 'large', 'scale', 'epic', 'relatively', 'meager', 'budget', 'Hooper', 'had', 'work', 'Also', 'impressive', 'David', 'Seidler', 'screenplay', 'septugenarian', 'Seidler', 'intricately', 'more', 'intimate', 'aspects', 'story', 'larger', 'scale', 'historical', 'details', 'script', 'so', 'rich', 'information', 'are', 'left', 'enthralled', 'King', 'Speech', 'once', 'generation', 'film', 'experience', 'will', 'be', 'savored', 'ages', 'totally', 'superfluous', 'note', 'recommend', 'couple', 'obscure', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'films', 'Fever', 'Pitch', 'Where', 'Truth', 'Lies', 'first', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'adaptation', 'second', 'intriguing', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'effort', 'Firth', 'interviews', 'cited', 'one', 'personal', 'favorites']",N/A

What a delight to have the freedom to choose one's own life path. The glitter and glitz of the royal life may seem desirable at first but has a dark underside which is clearly portrayed in this movie.Colin Firth does a compelling job as the future King George VI and dramatically portrays the challenges and difficulties he faced as he struggled to overcome some serious obstacles. One does not expect a royal child to suffer want and neglect but it seems that not even children of the nobility automatically escape these evils.The story starts just before the beginning of World War II and tells the story of the turbulent times that affected the royal family at both the political and emotional levels. It is fascinating to consider that these events were actually happening during the lifetimes of some of us.The casting is nigh unto perfect and all of the roles are beautifully played by seasoned members of the British theater. The movie is over so quickly as the story and the moving performances carry the viewer along as witnesses to a memorable period in world history.Watching the pictures of Hitler and the German army brought back many very uncomfortable thoughts; those of us who lived through that era can vividly remember the threat represented by those pictures. Not only was King George VI required to overcome some difficult personal problems, he had to assume leadership at a time of great challenge to not only England but the entire world.The movie is interesting at many levels; the acting, the scenery, the historic significance, and the sympathetic concern that is nurtured in the viewer as they watch the personal struggle the future King George VI experiences as he dutifully works to prepare himself for his assigned role in life.This movie is definitely worth the time it takes to watch it; I recommend it highly.",5,Rank Has Its Privileges But Rank Has Its Responsibilities,1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,1925,"['rather', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'immediately', 'made', 'very', 'happy', ""'m"", 'not', 'Royal', 'What', 'delight', 'have', 'freedom', 'choose', 'one', 'own', 'life', 'path', 'glitter', 'glitz', 'royal', 'life', 'may', 'seem', 'desirable', 'first', 'dark', 'underside', 'clearly', 'portrayed', 'movie.Colin', 'Firth', 'compelling', 'job', 'future', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'dramatically', 'challenges', 'difficulties', 'faced', 'struggled', 'overcome', 'serious', 'obstacles', 'One', 'not', 'expect', 'royal', 'child', 'suffer', 'want', 'neglect', 'not', 'even', 'children', 'nobility', 'automatically', 'evils.The', 'story', 'just', 'beginning', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'story', 'turbulent', 'times', 'affected', 'royal', 'family', 'political', 'emotional', 'levels', 'fascinating', 'consider', 'events', 'were', 'actually', 'happening', 'lifetimes', 'us.The', 'casting', 'nigh', 'unto', 'perfect', 'roles', 'are', 'beautifully', 'played', 'seasoned', 'members', 'British', 'theater', 'movie', 'so', 'quickly', 'story', 'moving', 'performances', 'carry', 'viewer', 'as', 'witnesses', 'memorable', 'period', 'world', 'history.Watching', 'pictures', 'Hitler', 'German', 'army', 'brought', 'back', 'many', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'thoughts', 'who', 'lived', 'era', 'can', 'vividly', 'remember', 'threat', 'represented', 'pictures', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'required', 'overcome', 'difficult', 'personal', 'problems', 'had', 'assume', 'leadership', 'time', 'great', 'challenge', 'not', 'only', 'England', 'entire', 'world.The', 'movie', 'interesting', 'many', 'levels', 'acting', 'scenery', 'historic', 'significance', 'sympathetic', 'concern', 'nurtured', 'viewer', 'watch', 'personal', 'struggle', 'future', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'dutifully', 'prepare', 'assigned', 'role', 'life.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'time', 'watch', 'recommend', 'highly']",N/A

It is a sort of travelogue, and that makes the movie's many, many shortcomings worth putting up with.The acting is good to the extent the actors have material to work with. However, the script is weak and gives actors little range, and repeats dramatic situations good when viewers first see them, but stale when repeated. For the first 20 minutes or so, we enjoy and appreciate the considerable talents and actor expertise of Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush (who play King George VI and his speech therapist respectively), we are shown the anguish of the King faced with speech problems he has, and the humor and teaching talents of the therapist in duet scenes the movie starts out with.Unfortunately, the movie fizzles after the first 20 minutes, and we see nothing new for the rest of the show. Just more anguish and more clever teaching done with humor. It gets old. Not the actors fault. They were and are good. But the screenwriter and the producers who hired the screenwriter simply didn't deliver the goods, but rather served up formulaic bromides about the inflexibility of King George V, the father of King George VI, the controversy and criticism which surrounded the future Duke of Windsor and his American girlfriend and future wife (Wallis Simpson, who like Camilla Bowles, Prince Charles' current wife, was divorced), and Hitler and the Nazis in Germany.Nothing new or original or interesting is part of any of that, and the movie lags and lags as a result.But the visual part of it all is good, and the lovely settings used and shown are terrific. The gigantic rooms, the expensive furniture, the grovelling servants and deference paid to the Royals by England's trained servile population are all there to see and capture our interest.It's an OK movie, and not more than that. Hollywood and the movie community worldwide have created great masterpieces over the history of movies as an art form, a history now more than a century old. WWW.Amazon.Com will sell used copies very cheap of the world's greatest movies (see the Library Of Congress National Film Registry List for 475 titles all worth seeing, all cheap in used form from Amazon.Com).The King's Speech (2011) has many good points and parts, but it is not a great movie. My advice is to see the great ones, and then if you have time left, check out OK but not great movies like The King's Speech (2011).------------------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.",2,"The King's Speech (2010) Is Another British Monarchy ""Behind The Scenes"" Movie",1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,3406,"['King', 'Speech', '2010', 'British', 'Monarchy', 'Scenes', 'Movie.The', 'King', 'Speech', '2010', 'starring', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'directed', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'yet', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'British', 'monarchy', 'Queen', '2008', 'Madness', 'King', 'George', 'III', 'latter', 'featuring', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Queen', 'England', 'past', 'present', '.The', 'next', 'Royal', 'Wedding', 'coming', 'up', 'soon', 'Prince', 'William', 'marries', 'later', 'year', 'tabloids', 'other', 'newspapers', 'watchers', 'British', 'Royals', 'are', 'getting', 'ready', 'spectacle', 'all.Interest', 'British', 'Royals', 'air', 'even', 'more', 'usual', 'soon', 'be', 'married', 'prince', 'may', 'well', 'become', 'next', 'King', 'should', 'father', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'give', 'job', 'being', 'mother', 'replacement', 'next', 'King', 'England', 'miss.The', 'King', 'Speech', '2010', 'movie', 'insides', 'many', 'grand', 'Royal', 'places', 'well', 'photographed', 'wonderful', 'color', 'sort', 'travelogue', 'movie', 'many', 'many', 'shortcomings', 'putting', 'up', 'with.The', 'acting', 'good', 'extent', 'actors', 'have', 'material', 'work', 'However', 'script', 'weak', 'actors', 'little', 'range', 'repeats', 'dramatic', 'situations', 'good', 'when', 'viewers', 'first', 'see', 'stale', 'when', 'repeated', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'enjoy', 'appreciate', 'considerable', 'talents', 'actor', 'expertise', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'who', 'play', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'speech', 'therapist', 'respectively', 'are', 'shown', 'anguish', 'King', 'faced', 'speech', 'problems', 'humor', 'teaching', 'talents', 'therapist', 'duet', 'scenes', 'movie', 'out', 'with.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'fizzles', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'see', 'nothing', 'new', 'rest', 'show', 'Just', 'more', 'anguish', 'more', 'clever', 'teaching', 'done', 'humor', 'old', 'Not', 'actors', 'fault', 'were', 'are', 'good', 'screenwriter', 'producers', 'who', 'hired', 'screenwriter', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'goods', 'rather', 'served', 'up', 'formulaic', 'bromides', 'inflexibility', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'father', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'controversy', 'criticism', 'surrounded', 'future', 'Duke', 'Windsor', 'American', 'girlfriend', 'future', 'wife', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'who', 'Camilla', 'Bowles', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'current', 'wife', 'was', 'divorced', 'Hitler', 'Nazis', 'Germany.Nothing', 'new', 'original', 'interesting', 'part', 'movie', 'lags', 'result.But', 'visual', 'part', 'good', 'lovely', 'settings', 'used', 'shown', 'are', 'terrific', 'gigantic', 'rooms', 'expensive', 'furniture', 'grovelling', 'servants', 'deference', 'paid', 'Royals', 'England', 'trained', 'servile', 'population', 'are', 'there', 'see', 'capture', 'interest.It', 'OK', 'movie', 'not', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'community', 'worldwide', 'have', 'created', 'great', 'masterpieces', 'history', 'movies', 'art', 'form', 'history', 'now', 'more', 'century', 'old', 'WWW.Amazon.Com', 'will', 'sell', 'used', 'copies', 'very', 'cheap', 'world', 'greatest', 'movies', 'see', 'Library', 'Congress', 'National', 'Film', 'Registry', 'List', '475', 'titles', 'worth', 'seeing', 'cheap', 'used', 'form', 'Amazon.Com', '.The', 'King', 'Speech', '2011', 'many', 'good', 'points', 'parts', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'advice', 'see', 'great', 'ones', 'then', 'have', 'time', 'left', 'check', 'out', 'OK', 'not', 'great', 'movies', 'King', 'Speech', '2011', 'Written', 'Tex', 'Allen', 'SAG', 'Actor']",N/A
1364926,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B003UESJH4,David R. Eastwood,"[0, 0]","At a time when our country is horribly divided and polarized, THE KING'S SPEECH is one of those great movies that will make you feel there really IS hope for the human race. And so much the better that it is based on the lives of real people who did something noble.Like TEMPLE GRANDIN, another great movie, this one deals with a person's struggle to overcome a handicap that has made it nearly impossible to interact with others. It shows how, partly through amazing good luck, a person was able to get help that worked, when everything looked grim and hopeless. The relationship between Bertie, the Duke of York (later King George VI, played by Colin Firth), and Lionel (a self-taught Australian speech therapist, played by Geoffrey Rush) is deeply touching and heart-warming.Of course we all know what the outcome will be before the movie even begins, but the script is so wonderfully written and the acting so awesome at every level that we are carried along from beginning to end with barely a flaw. (I have tiny quibbles about two things in the scene just before the coronation, but to bring them up would be like complaining that the sidewalk next to the Taj Mahal has a couple grasshoppers on it.)By total coincidence, two days after I watched THE KING'S SPEECH, I happened to see part of THE BLACK STALLION (1979) on TV--the scene where the young boy and the horse are on the desert island and are just becoming acquainted. The emotional impact of that scene, which shows the growing relationship of mutual trust and the joyfulness of the ultimate success, is VERY similar to the wonderful effect of THE KING'S SPEECH.This is a film you will want to watch over and over--and one you will happily share with your family and friends.",5,"IF YOU WERE TOUCHED BY ""TEMPLE GRANDIN,"" THIS FILM IS FOR YOU",1306281600,"05 25, 2011",2011,1740,"['time', 'when', 'country', 'horribly', 'divided', 'polarized', 'KING', 'SPEECH', 'one', 'great', 'movies', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'really', 'IS', 'hope', 'human', 'race', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'based', 'lives', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'something', 'noble.Like', 'TEMPLE', 'GRANDIN', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'person', 'struggle', 'overcome', 'handicap', 'made', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'interact', 'others', 'how', 'partly', 'amazing', 'good', 'luck', 'person', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'help', 'worked', 'when', 'everything', 'looked', 'grim', 'hopeless', 'relationship', 'Bertie', 'Duke', 'York', 'later', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'played', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Lionel', 'self-taught', 'Australian', 'speech', 'therapist', 'played', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'deeply', 'touching', 'heart-warming.Of', 'course', 'know', 'what', 'outcome', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'even', 'script', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'acting', 'so', 'awesome', 'level', 'are', 'carried', 'beginning', 'end', 'barely', 'flaw', 'have', 'tiny', 'quibbles', 'two', 'things', 'scene', 'just', 'coronation', 'bring', 'up', 'would', 'be', 'complaining', 'sidewalk', 'Taj', 'Mahal', 'couple', 'grasshoppers', 'total', 'coincidence', 'two', 'days', 'watched', 'THE', 'KING', 'SPEECH', 'happened', 'see', 'part', 'THE', 'BLACK', 'STALLION', '1979', 'TV', 'scene', 'where', 'young', 'boy', 'horse', 'are', 'desert', 'island', 'are', 'just', 'becoming', 'acquainted', 'emotional', 'impact', 'scene', 'growing', 'relationship', 'mutual', 'trust', 'joyfulness', 'ultimate', 'success', 'VERY', 'similar', 'wonderful', 'effect', 'THE', 'KING', 'SPEECH.This', 'film', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'one', 'will', 'happily', 'share', 'family', 'friends']",N/A

1364928,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B003UESJH4,Deborah Earle,"[2, 2]","It has been noted that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences tends to bestow its annually presented golden statuette on films about those who struggle with something, and for whom success does not come easily.On the 60th anniversary of the passing of the Great King George VI, I dedicate this review of a film about an extraordinary friendship between a hard-pressed and unexpected monarch, and a loyal subject who helped him find his voice and lead his people as well as an Empire at one of the most crucial moments in modern history.In the title role, Best Actor Colin Firth bears no real physical resemblance to the fair and slender George VI--a fact definitely not lost on the two Barbadian former subjects of the British Crown who raised me. But he accurately captures the frustration-born hostility of a man thrust into History's spotlight ill-prepared and through no wish of his own.Helena Bonham Carter plays the late Queen Mum Elizabeth, whose recollections of the film's events were things she wanted revealed only after her death because they were so painful. Bonham Carter, long overdue to receive an Oscar herself, epitomizes the  role of a loving and loyal wife, who procures the appointment for her husband with the Australian-born speech therapist and amateur actor, Lionel Logue(aptly and appropriately played by Aussie Geoffrey Rush) to help her husband, then the Duke of York with his stammering in 1934.Initially making a discreet appearance at Logue's dowdy residence, the Duchess of York introduces herself with a pseudenom, but soon reveals her husband's true identity to Logue, and while while expressing delight at meeting a member of the Royal Family, he does not become overly enthused as he answers what will be a call to greatness.The first meeting of the two men is awkward and a bit apprehensive. Logue even advises his royal client against smoking, warning that despite what his doctors say, it would kill him.As King George V, Michael Gambon pushes the Duke of York to improve his public speaking ability, knowing that the times demand that royals do more than just be silent and dignified in public, and also that the Duke's older brother, the future Edward VIII( Guy Pearce), is disgracing the monarchy with his affair with the married Wallis Simpson(Eve Best). He warns that the Duke, informally known as Bertie, must be the one who carries the family because when he is gone, his older brother ""will destroy himself, this family, and the nation within 12 months.""--a bit of very accurate dialogue.Altough there will be conflict between Logue and his royal patient, Logue is compelled to step up his services as the major events that shape Bertie's life unfold.In view of their disparate backgrounds, both men have loving and supportive wives and families. The current Queen Elizabeth II  as a child is portrayed by Freya Wilson and her sister, Margaret, by Ramona Marquez--and Logue's family are portrayed by Jennifer Ehle(once again sharing screentime with Firth as she had in A&E;'s ""Pride and Prejudice"" over a decade earlier)as Logue's wife, Myrtle, and Callum Gittins, Dominic Applewhite, and Ben Wimsett as his sons, Laurie, Valentine, and Anthony,who find themselves astonished by the presence of royalty. The rapport between two couples provides delightful moments, although the wives agree to maintain a barrier of formality whereas their husbands don't.Logue does psychoanalysis on the Duke, in which it is revealed that like many stammerers, he was left-handed, but forced to use his right hand (standard practice at that time), that his nanny abused and neglected him for three years,the death of his younger epileptic brother, John is mentioned, as is his father's desire that his children fear him as he feared his father--all stress factors contributing to his condition.Claire Bloom plays the prim and reserved Queen Mary, Derek Jacobi(the onetime portrayer of Roman Emperor Claudius the Stammerer) plays Archbishop Cosmo Lang, who helps Bertie deal with his brother's abdication and his own sudden thrust onto the throne.Anthony Andrews( who once played Edward VIII himself), as Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, and Roger Parrott and Timothy Spall are his successors Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill.Logue's methods prove effective as he attends his royal charge at critical moments. But I find myself questioning the use of profanity in this film. It's as though there can't be an Oscar winner for Best picture without any, especially since violence doesn't figure into this story. It may be accurate given what Bertie had to deal with, however.Nevertheless, director Tom Hooper and writer David Seidler have given a terse, solemn, but elegant presentation of the life of the man who became a unique power behind the throne--sent to help  a modern Moses who lamented his slowness of speech become the man he was destined to be, and to help him lead the world at the most critical time of the 20th century.",5,An Invisible Aaron to a King's Moses,1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,4978,"['been', 'noted', 'Academy', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Arts', 'Sciences', 'bestow', 'annually',

When King George V dies and King Edward shortly thereafter abdicates (in order to marry a commoner), Bertie (as he is known to his friends) becomes King George VI. A retiring man who hates public appearances and speeches because of his speech impediment, George VI seems utterly unsuited to be the ruler who will lead England through the dark days of the Second World War.Bertie's wife (Helen Bonham Carter), better known to the current generation as Queen Mother Elizabeth, takes him to speech therapist after speech therapist. Nothing works until he meets Logue. Although their relationship is sometimes stormy, a bond grows between them as Logue's method begins to work. This bond lasts not just through the duration of the war (during which time Logue is present at every radio speech given by the king), but until the death of George VI.Not only is this a wonderful and heartwarming story, one that well portrays the unusual bond between royalty and commoner, but the performance of all the principle actors is outstanding.

But for one man, it might have. ""The King's Speech"" chronicles the true-life story of King George VI's struggle to gain the confidence to lead his nation -- a powerful, tensely-written movie, with some truly brilliant performances.For many years, Prince Albert (Colin Firth) dreaded any kind of public speaking because of his crippling stammer. So his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham-Carter) drags him to a speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), who gives him vocal and physical exercises. Logue also learns more about ""Bertie's"" psyche -- his sensitivity, his low self-esteem, and his fears that he will let down his country.And Bertie has never needed help so badly -- his father is dying, his older brother David is too obsessed with his married lover to care about ""kinging,"" and World War II is fast approaching. And when the throne is handed to Bertie, Logue must help him get through his coronation, and a vital speech announcing the beginning of the war.""The King's Speech"" takes place on two very different levels. On one hand, it's about an underappreciated prince's rise to become king just before World War II, and the events that led to it. On the other, it's about one man slowly learning to overcome his fear with the help of a friend.Director Tom Hooper really knows to create powerful drama even from seemingly small things, and to evoke strong emotions from the simplest scenes. There are some lighter moments (the hysterical scene where Bertie runs around shouting four-letter words) and some glimpses of Bertie and Lionel's lives with their families.But the strength of this movie lies in the gut-wrenching scenes where Bertie's therapy is put to the test. We see him struggling to speak to his own brother, and it's genuinely saddening when he crumbles into tongue-tied misery... just as it's uplifting when he manages to speak clearly and with earnestness.And since the movie is all about the king, a brilliant lead actor is absolutely essential. Firth is absolutely perfect -- nervous, fearful, stiff, quick-tempered, and always choking on his own words. And you can see how desperate he is to help his nation.

His wife, Elizabeth, fed up with the long list of ""qualified"" professionals who cannot help her husband, hires Lionel Logue to treat Albert.  Logue is an Australian &eacute;migr&eacute; whose methods are, to say the least, unconventional.  Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush with his usual energy and panache, empathizes with his client.  However, he lets ""Bertie"" know that he must do as he is told if he wants to improve.  He urges Albert to curse, sing, perform repetitive and weird exercises, and speak freely about his painful childhood. Unsurprisingly, Albert and Logue do not see eye to eye.""The King's Speech,"" directed by Tom Hooper from David Seidler's witty and poignant script, depicts Albert's valiant attempt to overcome his crippling handicap.  Colin Firth is exceptional as Albert, a man who never expected to be king.  His older brother, Edward, ascends the throne upon the death of their cold and commanding father, but abdicates to marry the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson.  Thus, Albert is thrust into the role of monarch, and, as George VI, he is required to address his subjects using a relatively new technology--radio.  When England declares war against Germany, George delivers an address (with Logue's assistance), in an effort to rally and unite the nation.Firth and Rush play off one another brilliantly and Carter is lovely and warm as Albert's ever-supportive wife.  However, the movie sags a bit in the second half, as Albert and Logue repeatedly quarrel and reconcile.  Since it is obvious where the story is headed, the main pleasure lies in watching two virtuoso performers, Firth and Rush, struggle to understand and appreciate one another's point of view.  It is inspiring to see the tenacious and creative Logue help George find his voice after suffering through years of self-loathing and insecurity.  What begins as a prickly and precarious relationship between two men with nothing in common evolves into an enduring and mutually beneficial friendship.",4,"""I have a voice!""",1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,2110,"['When', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'called', 'give', 'speech', 'British', 'Empire', 'Exhibition', '1925', 'stammer', 'excruciating', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'fed', 'up', 'long', 'list', 'qualified', 'professionals', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'husband', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'treat', 'Albert', 'Logue', 'Australian', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'methods', 'are', 'say', 'least', 'unconventional', 'Logue', 'played', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'usual', 'energy', 'panache', 'client', 'However', 'Bertie', 'know', 'must', 'do', 'told', 'improve', 'Albert', 'curse', 'sing', 'perform', 'repetitive', 'weird', 'exercises', 'speak', 'freely', 'painful', 'childhood', 'Unsurprisingly', 'Albert', 'Logue', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'eye', 'eye', 'King', 'Speech', 'directed', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'David', 'Seidler', 'witty', 'poignant', 'script', 'Albert', 'valiant', 'attempt', 'overcome', 'crippling', 'handicap', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'exceptional', 'Albert', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'expected', 'be', 'king', 'older', 'brother', 'Edward', 'throne', 'death', 'cold', 'commanding', 'father', 'marry', 'twice-divorced', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'Thus', 'Albert', 'thrust', 'role', 'monarch', 'George', 'VI', 'required', 'address', 'subjects', 'using', 'relatively', 'new', 'technology', 'radio', 'When', 'England', 'war', 'Germany', 'George', 'address', 'Logue', 'assistance', 'effort', 'rally', 'unite', 'nation.Firth', 'Rush', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'brilliantly', 'Carter', 'lovely', 'warm', 'Albert', 'ever-supportive', 'wife', 'However', 'movie', 'bit', 'second', 'half', 'Albert', 'Logue', 'repeatedly', 'quarrel', 'reconcile', 'obvious', 'where', 'story', 'headed', 'main', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'two', 'virtuoso', 'performers', 'Firth', 'Rush', 'struggle', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'one', 'point', 'view', 'inspiring', 'see', 'tenacious', 'creative', 'Logue', 'help', 'George', 'find', 'voice', 'suffering', 'years', 'self-loathing', 'insecurity', 'What', 'prickly', 'precarious', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'nothing', 'common', 'evolves', 'enduring', 'mutually', 'beneficial', 'friendship']",N/A

1364956,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B003UESJH4,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","Tonight is the ceremony of the 83rd Academy Awards, which signals the official end of the 2010 movie year, and it has taken me a while to find an opportunity to see the Best Picture and Best Actor frontrunner, director Tom Hooper's (HBO'sJohn Adams) intimate chamber-piece historical drama about how King George VI overcame a debilitating stutter and went on to lead the British empire through World War II. Written by Tom Seidler (his last big-screen credits were a couple of animated films in the late 90's), it is exactly the type of movie that the Academy praises with their accolades, and in this case, it appears justified for a number of elements, chief of which is Colin Firth's masterful portrayal of the painfully shy former monarch thrown into the spotlight by his older brother who could not give up the twice-divorced woman he loved.George VI was known as Bertie to his intimates, and despite his royal lineage, he had no intention of assuming the throne. However, he had to speak in public periodically as part of his duties and stammered hopelessly as is illustrated in the film's opening scene when as Prince Albert, the Duke of York, he chokes and stutters uncontrollably at the close of the 1925 British Empire Exhibition in front of thousands at Wembley Stadium. It's one of several traumatizing experiences for Bertie, but his fair-minded wife Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother, recognizes that her husband needs to overcome the situation to serve the empire. She enlists the help of Lionel Logue, an Australian speech therapist (and failed actor) based in London, whose unorthodox methods include encouraging his clients to sing, spit out profanities, and share intimate childhood secrets that may unlock the cause of their speech impediments.More familiar historical events take over in the film. When his father, George V, dies in 1936, his brother David ascends the throne as King Edward VIII, but for years, he has been smitten with Wallis Simpson, an American divorc&eacute;e socialite, whom he wants to marry despite the fact that she would never be accepted as the Queen. This constitutional crisis causes Edward VIII to abdicate and thus force Bertie to take the throne. This chain of events causes rifts among the main male characters that are healed by the onset of a world war. Throughout this period, Bertie and Lionel privately work together in painstaking fashion to overcome the new king's stammering. The climax is the 1939 radio speech that George VI needs to deliver to his subjects upon declaration of war against Germany to motivate them to keep their spirits high during the empire's darkest hour.It's not that Firth does anything all that different here as Bertie from his previous work like last year'sA Single Man, but his dexterous performance resonates in the way he can be forbiddingly regal and tenderly vulnerable nearly in the same moment. Geoffrey Rush has a field day playing Logue as he gets to represent the audience point of view with his character's acerbic observations and modestly respectable family life. After showy turns in her partner Tim Burton's films (Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,Alice in Wonderland), Helena Bonham Carter is comparatively demure as Elizabeth, but her innately steely resolve shines through in a flattering portrayal of the woman who would become the most beloved royal in her later years. The trio of actors makes for a particularly effective dynamic among real-life characters and highly personal situations.Smaller roles are filled expertly if sometimes a bit broadly - Guy Pearce playing David as a superficial, nasally fop not above ridiculing his brother's stammering; Derek Jacobi as the Archbishop of Canterbury highly suspicious of Logue's intentions; Michael Gambon appropriately distant as the dying king; and Timothy Spall who does a somewhat ham-fisted turn in what appears to be a caricature of Winston Churchill. Claire Bloom was virtually unrecognizable in a near-bit role as Queen Mary. Careful craftsmanship abound in this production from Danny Cohen's subtle cinematography to Eve Stewart's stately production design to Alexandre Desplat's stately soundtrack, which includes a most effective use of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony during the final scene.",4,Historical Events Intimately Told with Regal Humility Thanks to Firth's Career-Defining Performance,1298764800,"02 27, 2011",2011,4274,"['Tonight', 'ceremony', '83rd', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'official', 'end', '2010', 'movie', 'year', 'taken', 'while', 'find', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Actor', 'frontrunner', 'director', 'Tom', 'Hooper', ""HBO'sJohn"", 'Adams', 'intimate', 'chamber-piece', 'historical', 'drama', 'how', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'debilitating', 'stutter', 'went', 'lead', 'British', 'empire', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Written', 'Tom', 'Seidler', 'last', 'big-screen', 'credits', 'were', 'couple', 'animated', 'films', 'late', '90', 'exactly', 'type', 'movie', 'Academy', 'praises', 'accolades', 'case', 'justified', 'number', 'elements', 'chief', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'masterful', 'portrayal', 'painfully', 'shy', 'former', 'monarch', 'thrown', 'spotlight', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'twice-divorced', 'woman', 'loved.George', 'VI', 'was', 'known', 'Bertie', 'intimates', 'royal', 'lineage', 'had', 'intention', 'assuming', 'throne', 'However', 'had', 'speak', 'public', 'periodically', 'part', 'duties', 'stammered', 'hopelessly', 'illustrated', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'when', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'Duke', 'York', 'stutters', 'uncontrollably', 'close', '1925', 'British', 'Empire', 'Exhibition', 'front', 'thousands', 'Wembley', 'Stadium', 'one', 'several', 'traumatizing', 'experiences', 'Bertie', 'fair-minded', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'later', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'husband', 'overcome', 'situation', 'serve', 'empire', 'help', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'Australian', 'speech', 'therapist', 'failed', 'actor', 'based', 'London', 'unorthodox', 'methods', 'include', 'encouraging', 'clients', 'sing', 'spit', 'out', 'profanities', 'share', 'intimate', 'childhood', 'secrets', 'may', 'unlock', 'cause', 'speech', 'impediments.More', 'familiar', 'historical', 'events', 'take', 'over', 'film', 'When', 'father', 'George', 'V', '1936', 'brother', 'David', 'throne', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'years', 'been', 'smitten', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'American', 'divorc', 'eacute', 'socialite', 'whom', 'marry', 'fact', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'accepted', 'Queen', 'constitutional', 'crisis', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'abdicate', 'thus', 'force', 'Bertie', 'take', 'throne', 'chain', 'events', 'causes', 'rifts', 'main', 'male', 'characters', 'are', 'healed', 'onset', 'world', 'war', 'period', 'Bertie', 'Lionel', 'privately', 'work', 'together', 'painstaking', 'fashion', 'overcome', 'new', 'king', 'stammering', 'climax', '1939', 'radio', 'speech', 'George', 'VI', 'deliver', 'subjects', 'declaration', 'war', 'Germany', 'motivate', 'keep', 'spirits', 'high', 'empire', 'darkest', 'hour.It', 'not', 'Firth', 'anything', 'different', 'here', 'Bertie', 'previous', 'work', 'last', ""year'sA"", 'Single', 'Man', 'dexterous', 'performance', 'resonates', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'forbiddingly', 'regal', 'tenderly', 'vulnerable', 'nearly', 'same', 'moment', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'field', 'day', 'playing', 'Logue', 'represent', 'audience', 'point', 'view', 'character', 'acerbic', 'observations', 'modestly', 'respectable', 'family', 'life', 'showy', 'turns', 'partner', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'films', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'comparatively', 'demure', 'Elizabeth', 'innately', 'steely', 'resolve', 'shines', 'flattering', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'most', 'beloved', 'royal', 'later', 'years', 'trio', 'actors', 'particularly', 'effective', 'dynamic', 'real-life', 'characters', 'highly', 'personal', 'situations.Smaller', 'roles', 'are', 'filled', 'expertly', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'broadly', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'playing', 'David', 'superficial', 'nasally', 'not', 'ridiculing', 'brother', 'stammering', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Archbishop', 'Canterbury', 'highly', 'suspicious', 'Logue', 'intentions', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'appropriately', 'distant', 'dying', 'king', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'who', 'somewhat', 'ham-fisted', 'turn', 'what', 'be', 'caricature', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'was', 'virtually', 'unrecognizable', 'near-bit', 'role', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'Careful', 'craftsmanship', 'abound', 'production', 'Danny', 'Cohen', 'subtle', 'cinematography', 'Eve', 'Stewart', 'stately', 'production', 'design', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'stately', 'soundtrack', 'most', 'effective', 'use', 'Beethoven', 'Seventh', 'Symphony', 'final', 'scene']",N/A

In this one, you get all of what you can expect and more.Colin Firth plays the Duke of York, ""Bertie"" who is the second in line to the throne. He loathes the public spotlight and public speaking because of his stammer. His wife, Elizabeth decides to engage an obscure Australian whose address lists nothing more than his name, Lionel Logue and the words ""Speech Defects."" Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush, sets the terms and conditions of the visit. After several failed attempts with doctors and an impatient King George V, played by Simon Chandler, she puts her royal conditions aside to accept his. But their first meeting does not go well as the Duke is demoted to an equal of a commoner. Faced with the prospect of a second meeting or the humiliation of public speaking he reluctantly submits to Logue's lessons and therapy.Two events raise the ugly specter of speaking to his subjects. His father dies and his brother, David gives up the throne to marry a divorcee. Logue is there to assist him again despite the effort of the Archishop of Canterbury (played by Derek Jacobi) who attempts to throw an adjustable spanner in their relationship. Will it destroy the trust ""Bertie"" has developed for ""Lionel"" right before the coronation, or has a bond of friendship developed that is too strong to cast aside?Colin Firth draws a depth of emotion I never thought capable in what I had previously thought of a waxed figure from previous performances. The timing of his stammers and taut facial expressions captures the approach-avoidance conflict of a noble wanting to fulfill his royal obligations versus running and hiding from any public appearance.Geoffrey Rush uses his eyes to convey his depth of feeling that he keeps under control, peering, evaluating, what makes his charge stammer so badly. You can see him searching for what cannot be seen but is yet to be known. His keen perception is revealed with spontaneous challenges and a quick wit and calm demeanor that contrasts with that of his patient.Helen Bonham Carter plays the Duke's adoring and supportive wife. (After her husband's death she would simply be known as the Queen Mum). Clair Bloom plays the Duke's mother, and Guy Pearce plays his older brother, the Prince of Wales, the soon to be Edward VII, and sooner to be Duke of Windsor. He is portrayed in a less flattering role when dealing with his younger brother's affliction. Every performance is masterful.This is a movie that is not to be missed. It has received numerous nominations for Academy Awards that will be revealed later this evening. I hope you will spend one evening in your home or theater to watch a command performance.

It is uneven and obscure, has waded into stinky murky water, and I am so happy this film wasn't treated that way.In addition, right off the top, there is no way I can resist directing you to read my review ofBertie and Elizabeth: The Reluctant Royals - The Story of King George VI & Queen Elizabethwhich I saw and loved so many years ago. Then as a proper companion you must also getThe Windsors/Bertie and Elizabethfor the proper history.

Please read my reviews of all, and do not forget to thank me for my efforts.THE KING'S SPEECH (a double entendre if ever there was one) takes us into the hell of the stammerer, the stutterer - it shows the immense bravery to be faced daily, hourly, by them. True heroes. This film presents us with an old hero who reluctantly did what he had to do, went above and beyond. Then he was simply forgotten. What I love here is this film rights that wrong.This is a well-deserved Oscar darling (12 nominations which ought to have equalled 12 wins), and thank heavens Colin Firth, the Golden Man, has finally got a gold man. I see a lot of reviewers saying Colin Firth plays Colin Firth - and that is offensive. The man is a fine actor, this perhaps his finest hour. Blame past producers for not giving him better roles in the past.My favorite prince of all time, Prince Albert (""Bertie"") the Duke of York, was a skinny-as-a-pencil, stammering, shrinking violet and, as the wallflower of the century, lucked out snagging Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (badly played as an uppity prig by Helena Bonham Carter). He did not suspect that his brother, King Edward VIII (a stunning Guy Pearce), would abdicate over a manipulative harpie. He did not suspect he'd be king. What's even better is that today, his daughter still reigns.This film concentrates on a specific period: just prior to Edward's abdication, followed by King George VI as a guiding beacon for England during WWII. Lionel Logue (a competent, always delightful Geoffrey Rush), the self-made speech therapist who helped the king, had actually been working with him since 1922. The film erroneously has the two meeting for the first time in 1934.This film zeroes in on the speech that would hopefully buoy England at her darkest hour - but in the event of curiosity, ""the speech"" refers to both the coronation speech and the first speech of World War II. You will roar with laughter at the ""swearing exercises"" the king was encouraged to do; and surely you will weep when you hear the entire WWII speech accompanied intensely by Beethoven, with the speech timed to the music.The street scenes are remarkable, as are the Elstree sets which I can never quite believe, they are so good. Logue seems almost as poster-like as the king, and I'd have appreciated a deeper study in characters. This film, at just under two hours, could have stretched a half hour longer and accomplished the depth. Derek Jacobi is a marvel as the eternally smug Archbishop of Canterbury Cosmo Long - who was as mean a bastard as King Edward VIII had been.Logue was with the king at all his broadcast speeches, and present someplace or other at nearly all royal functions. Logue was made a CRVO (Commander of the Royal Victorian Order) in 1944. That is a unique chivalric order awarded for personal services rendered to the monarch. I missed that scene - but we can't have everything. Be contented with the astonishing cameo: King George V by Sir Michael Gambon. He played King Edward VII inThe Lost Prince(vid. my review), and is a most welcome sight.You shall be certified mad if you haven't seen or do not own this classic film.

Bristol ""bibliophile""","[1, 1]","A cynical reviewer would suspect that those behind ""The King's Speech,"" own a dogeared copy of ""Oscar Movie Making for Dummies.""  But a honest one would admit they succeeded admirably. From the first scene on, there's never any confusion about how to feel or who to root for.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing.Colin Firth stars in this true life story of King George VI (at the start, the Duke of York), who consulted Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), in order to cope with a pronounced stammer and fear of public speaking. Logue is well, quirky.  He insists on first names, even with royal clients.  He makes the Duke visit his office and deal with his bizarre elevator.  He even plops himself down in St. Edward's chair in Westminster Abbey.  If you can imagine.If you've seen ""Ordinary People,"" or any Hollywood movie about therapy, you know why he's doing this, and you can predict the course of the treatment, its final outcome, and its effects on both therapist and client without trying.  This does not, however, lessen the impact of the film.  In addition, if you're a classical music lover, it has a great score.All the cast does a terrific job, even those who have the narrow ""bad guy"" roles. This includes Guy Pearce, as the older brother who abdicated the throne for the love of a twice divorced woman, also showing scars from a less than nurturing childhood.Thoughts on the heroes of  ""The Social Network,"" vs. ""The King's Speech,"" (both Best Picture Oscar contenders).While it may seem sacrilege to suggest that a man who led a nation through World War II, and a guy who betrayed his best friend to start a billion dollar company have anything in common, both (in the movie version) do.  Both are portrayed as being suspicious of other people's motives, quick to take offense where none was meant, and lacking empathy for those who are trying to be their friend.  And both movies do an excellent job of showing how this attitude, not just the newfangled wireless or Facebook, only isolates the person further.  The difference is that while ""The King's Speech,"" provides a back story which makes it easier to empathize with the protagonist, ""The Social Network,"" forces the viewer to take its hero at face value. I'm not sure which is the ""better"" movie, Oscar-wise, but I think ""The Social Network"" is a braver one.

He seeks help from Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a speech therapist from Australia who uses novel methods to get his patients beyond their speech problems.The Duke becomes King George VI after the death of his father and the abdication of his brother--and it became vital as the age of radio flowered for the King to become an inspiring public speaker, especially since another major European war appeared imminent.  The two men work through issues of equality, hierarchy, and psychology as they build trust and an eventual friendship as they prepare for the King's speech that would lead the British Empire into World War II.Gallup polls consistently show public speaking at or near the top of the list of fears of Americans, which is one reason why the film was such a big hit--we all know that in public speaking, the stakes are high.  Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford surely regretted their debate performances for the rest of their days, and I'm sure that Al Gore will regret his for the rest of his.While the everyday citizen might not have speech issues on par with the King's, most of us can identify--you might have flubbed key lines during a one-act play competition in high school, or choked on a critical date, or frozen during a job interview, or botched a toast at a friend's wedding reception, or said something foolish during a presentation at work.

Yes, I knew it would be a British film, a period piece, a study of a stutterer. Those things did not keep me away, but neither did they draw me into the theater at full price. The movie is so much more than that, though, full of humor, tension, and pathos, and shame on me for expecting any less with a cast of this caliber.Colin Firth plays a middle-aged royal, growing up in the first half of the twentieth century, through the First World War and the threat of a second. We see him early on, attempting to deliver a speech in his public role as a son of the British monarchy, and we ache with his struggle. Soon, though, his role becomes more than that, when his ailing father passes away and his older brother is put on the pedestal as the reigning king. Only one problem: the older brother is more interested in pursuing his private pleasures and personal love than in taking on that lordly mantel, and this waywardness puts the British Empire in danger as Hitler lurks on the European horizon. Who can rise up with integrity and courage to speak boldly for British subjects around the world? Can Colin Firth's historical figure fill those shoes when he can't even utter a sentence without stuttering?It's this true-to-life and larger-than-life tableau that make the story much more engaging and important than I realized from the trailers and ads. Not only is one man, one royal, facing his own fears and insecurities birthed from the past, but he is also doing so as a figurehead for millions of others in one of the most important hours of the last hundred years.Firth is incredible in his role, giving us so much emotion through tiny tics and twitches, through each word and lack thereof. Just as powerful, Geoffrey Rush is the Australian therapist who casts aside all pretensions and treats his royal patient as an equal. The interactions between them are priceless. Helena Bonham Carter plays Firth's wife, a subdued role for her, and one in which she shows her range. Add to this Guy Pearce and Timothy Spall, among others, and it's hard to imagine any better cast. The story is engaging, funny, and ultimately moving. And there's some strangely vicarious enjoyment in seeing Queen Elizabeth portrayed as a young girl, as well as Winston Churchill in his hours before becoming prime minister.In a year of some very strong films for the Best Picture Oscar, I find no reason to complain about this one pulling out the victory.

But when World War II broke out and the King was called to duty to galvanize his nation by speaking to his subjects, he found friendship and rehabilitation by an Australian speech therapist named Lionel Logue (played masterfully by Geoffrey Rush.)Firth and Rush both deserve Oscars for their performances; best actor and best supporting actor, respectively.",5,Unstammeringly Smashing!,1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,1092,"['just', 'saw', 'King', 'Speech', 'had', 'whole', 'theater', 'myself.This', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'now', 'most', 'prominent', 'British', 'personality', 'could', 'think', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'blubbering', 'shadow', 'stood', 'man', 'who', 'fought', 'far', 'greater', 'battle', 'even', 'fighting', 'Hitler', 'Public', 'Speaking', 'King', 'Albert', 'Frederick', 'Arthur', 'George', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'played', 'Collin', 'Firth', 'stammered', 'most', 'life', 'had', 'become', 'reluctant', 'King', 'abdication', 'throne', 'elder', 'brother', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'stutter', 'caused', 'problems', 'especially', 'carrying', 'out', 'only', 'real', 'duty', 'monarch', 'country', 'revolutionized', 'finance', 'industrialization', 'when', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'broke', 'out', 'King', 'was', 'called', 'duty', 'galvanize', 'nation', 'speaking', 'subjects', 'found', 'friendship', 'rehabilitation', 'Australian', 'speech', 'therapist', 'named', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'played', 'masterfully', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Firth', 'Rush', 'deserve', 'Oscars', 'performances', 'best', 'actor', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'respectively']",N/A

The King's Speech is more than a ""historical fiction"" piece. Some dissenters dismiss the film as being typical Best Picture stuff, mocking its relevance, questioning its historical accuracy, or complaining that it was too predictable. I think they are missing the point of the film. It is about a powerful man's journey to overcome an impediment that is common, but one that is a crushing, debilitating roadblock for a high profile leader. It is about suffering through, but overcoming, one's problems, and the humility of that process. It is about the anxieties we all have in life. Moreover, it is about the friendship bond between a common man and the King, and the significance that bond has in the King's life.There are many moving scenes in The King's Speech, and the casting is superb. The opening scene where Bertie attempts to address the crowd, but stammers awkwardly, is painful to endure but incredibly powerful. When Bertie's frustration hits a peak and he cries out, ""I am not a king"" with his wife trying to console him, it is the most powerful moment in the film, and a turning point of sorts. Collin Firth does an excellent job as the man who becomes King and is thrust into the public spotlight when his brother, David, steps down. Geoffrey Rush, as therapist Lionel Logue, really is the most impressive, as he brings humor, wit and edginess to his role confident and coach of Bertie.The script was also well crafted. As Colin Firth points out in the ""Making of"" documentary, in any good writing you learn about the main character through their struggles. Bertie's struggles help you learn about the pressures he faces in daily life. Lionel Logue is multi-faceted, as he has a brashness to him, but wit and passion to help Bertie.The features on the disc are top notch also. There is an insightful ""Making of"" documentary, where the friendship of the two men is explored. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush give insight into their roles. A Q and A session with the cast and director gives thoughts and perspectives on the process of the film. There are even a few audio recordings of actual speeches given by King George, as well as an option to have audio commentary.The King's Speech is an excellent viewing experience all around.",5,"Deserves all its praise, amazing viewing experience all around",1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,2376,"['Oscars', 'have', 'been', 'hit', 'miss', 'recent', 'years', 'as', 'far', 'Best', 'Picture', 'give', 'kudos', 'past', 'year', 'selection', 'King', 'Speech', 'more', 'historical', 'fiction', 'piece', 'dissenters', 'dismiss', 'film', 'being', 'typical', 'Best', 'Picture', 'stuff', 'mocking', 'relevance', 'questioning', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'complaining', 'was', 'too', 'predictable', 'think', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'film', 'powerful', 'man', 'journey', 'overcome', 'impediment', 'common', 'one', 'crushing', 'debilitating', 'roadblock', 'high', 'profile', 'leader', 'suffering', 'overcoming', 'one', 'problems', 'humility', 'process', 'anxieties', 'have', 'life', 'Moreover', 'friendship', 'bond', 'common', 'man', 'King', 'significance', 'bond', 'King', 'are', 'many', 'moving', 'scenes', 'King', 'Speech', 'casting', 'superb', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'Bertie', 'address', 'crowd', 'stammers', 'awkwardly', 'painful', 'endure', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'When', 'Bertie', 'frustration', 'peak', 'out', 'am', 'not', 'king', 'wife', 'trying', 'console', 'most', 'powerful', 'moment', 'film', 'turning', 'point', 'sorts', 'Collin', 'Firth', 'excellent', 'job', 'man', 'who', 'King', 'thrust', 'public', 'spotlight', 'when', 'brother', 'David', 'down', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'therapist', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'really', 'most', 'impressive', 'humor', 'wit', 'edginess', 'role', 'confident', 'coach', 'Bertie.The', 'script', 'was', 'also', 'well', 'crafted', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'points', 'out', 'Making', 'documentary', 'good', 'writing', 'learn', 'main', 'character', 'struggles', 'Bertie', 'struggles', 'help', 'learn', 'pressures', 'daily', 'life', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'multi-faceted', 'brashness', 'wit', 'passion', 'help', 'Bertie.The', 'features', 'disc', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'also', 'insightful', 'Making', 'documentary', 'where', 'friendship', 'two', 'men', 'explored', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'give', 'insight', 'roles', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'cast', 'director', 'thoughts', 'perspectives', 'process', 'film', 'are', 'even', 'few', 'audio', 'recordings', 'actual', 'speeches', 'given', 'King', 'George', 'as', 'well', 'option', 'have', 'audio', 'commentary.The', 'King', 'Speech', 'excellent', 'viewing', 'experience']",N/A

I'm very wary of friends' recommendations because the majority of people are content with the pablum that constitutes most movies these days. But I took my wife to see it in the theater (we watch very few in the theaters) and then again with my 2 oldest children last night!Wow! On so many levels: ""Wow!""First, there is the authenticity. The fact that this is based on history and in history adds extra texture and depth to the film that most films simply can't achieve.Second, George VI (before he was King) manifested an incredibly persistent courage, in spite of his baggage growing up, the gravity and importance of his life, and the disability of his stuttering. This is a very autobiographical issue for me (not stuttering but introversion and other issues) and a wonderful example for my children.Third, the acting is spot on, especially in both the King (Colin Firth) and the speech coach's (Geoffrey Rush) characters. The character of the King-to-be's speech coach is not only humorous but is also a great example of the power and confidence that comes from having mastered one's field.Fourth, the development of the relationship between the Prince and Lionel Logue (the speech coach) is a joy to watch as it unfolds. There are many details that make it an authentic telling of the unfolding of an unusual and instructive relationship. It was also a revelation, watching the second time, that both of the admirable men in the movie, the Prince and his coach, had loving, supportive, wise wives standing beside them (as opposed to Wallis Simpson in relation to Prince Edward (who looks like a complete fool in the movie.)It's ironic that this movie received an R rating for language. Technically, it deserves the R rating, for it drops the F bomb as much as just about any movie. However, it's the one movie I've seen where the use of profanity was actually required by the script and circumstances. The contrast between the exalted station of the Prince and his use of expletives also made the scenes where he used profanity very funny.I've been watching classic films (""The King's Speech"" has all the markings of a classic) with my older kids. One of the things I've pointed out, in watching the original ""Lord of the Flies,"" ""The Killing Fields,"" and now ""The King's Speech"" is that they should notice that great movies don't need a noisy and noisome soundtrack to keep you interested or to tell you how to feel.

I was expecting this to be some snooty ""eau"" type movie like Sense And Sensibility or something, but it turned out to keep my attention so that I wasn't drifting off to sleep halfway through it.There are plenty of tender moments as the future king struggles with his speech impediment and then lashes out at his therapist.

1364980,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B003UESJH4,F. S. L'hoir,"[6, 8]","I saw this film, which I have pre-ordered on Amazon, three times already; and I daresay I shall watch it many more times. ""The King's Speech"" is adult entertainment in the most noble sense of the expression. The script is outstanding in its intelligence, and if there were an award for the best use of profanity in context without giving offence, I would definitely give it to ""The King's Speech."" The film is simply splendid! Without benefit of car chases, explosions, or overly-spectacular CGI, the audience is riveted--indeed, held spellbound--for 119 minutes by a simple scenario: a wife seeks professional help for her husband's speech impediment; he undergoes therapy and with persistent practice, he overcomes--if not conquers--his problem despite the low expectations of the public and, most of all, of himself. That the wife is the Duchess of York and the husband is the future King of England is irrelevant and at the same time empowering: the story contains a universal truth; the future king, like the kings of Greek tragedy, represents every man as he learns through suffering.Since the actors have been deservedly praised to the skies, I shall comment only upon a few points that impressed me. Colin Firth's portrayal of Bertie is so believable, because he conveys the unimaginable physical tension of a man whose thoughts are entrapped within his body; and paradoxically, Firth does so with ease; there is nothing forced about his portrayal. Geoffrey Rush, who plays his therapist Lionel Logue with sensitivity and humour, is certainly Firth's equal. It is a shame that a double Oscar could not have been awarded. Both Firth and Rush provide an equilibrium that would certainly be upset if either one were taken away (or if one were one replaced by another actor). I was especially struck by Rush's ability to portray a not-very-good amateur, when he tries out for the part of Richard III; he suggests an ever-so slight hamminess without actually hamming it up. A difficult challenge for any actor, much less one of his stature! I also thought that Helena Bonham Carter, who exhibits a combination of privilege and propriety tempered by kindness, was a perfect foil for Jennifer Ehle (Rush's wife), who exhibits similar characteristics and also understands the boundaries of decorum: a wonderful moment comes when a surprised Ehle politely asks the royal couple if they will be staying for dinner, and the Duchess graciously thanks her and cites a previous engagement as if it were a necessary annoyance.One of the things that British filmmakers do so well is to cast supporting roles with top-drawer actors, disguising them thoroughly. I found myself reading the credits the first time around and exclaiming to my friend: ""Good Heavens! Anthony Andrews was playing Stanley Baldwin. I certainly didn't recognise him!"" Claire Bloom also inhabited the persona of Queen Mary so thoroughly that I didn't know it was she until the end credits. It took a few minutes for me to recognise Derek Jacobi as the Archbishop, and I recognised Michael Gambon as George V only by his voice, and a certain look in his eyes. Each submerges his own personality into his respective role. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Timothy Spall, who provides what I consider the only false note, giving me the impression that he is no other than Timothy Spall, pouting, and acting Churchillian. I found it most expedient to avert my eyes whenever he came on the screen and focus on all the other things to love about this movie.This film combines pathos with humour. My friend and I were blubbering (as silently as possible) and laughing (out loud) all the way through it. And because of the skills of Colin Firth and Jeffrey Rush in conveying the feelings of Bertie and Lionel, our emotional responses were spontaneous and not prised out of us, as happens too often in films nowadays. I was especially moved as the film reached its climax, knowing the tragedy that was about to strike Europe, the people of England, and indeed the world. I therefore found the Allegretto movement of Beethoven's 7th Symphony to be especially appropriate as King George reads his speech. The music acts as a funeral march and it emphasises the gravity of the situation and the gravity of the actual words which King George VI, via the radio, delivered so eloquently to the world, giving it the courage to persist in one of its darkest hours.The King's speech remains emblematic of one man's courage.

1364981,A2BPDFR58H9575,B003UESJH4,Galina,"[24, 27]","The film ""The King's Speech"" is wonderfully absorbing, and absolutely deserves all of 12 nominations for the Academy Awards. I went to see it after it has been universally praised as one of the best films from the last year, and I expected it to be good. I just did not expect it to be that good. One would think, why a film about the speech problems of the British prince from 80 years ago, who suddenly becomes the King of England, attracts the viewers, makes them care for the main character, and remains in memory days after it is over? One of the reasons - the starring performance of Colin Firth. This is his personal best performance and the best performance by an actor from the year 2010. It is truly memorable. He was able to show a tormented man who was born close to throne but was not supposed to become a King and emperor due to his status of the second King's son. But he had accepted the King's responsibilities after his father died and his older brother, Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry the woman he loved. Prince Berti, the Duke of York had in him what it takes to be a great ruler but he could not communicate it to the people because he suffered from the terrible case of stutter when he had to give the public speeches. We see Prince ""Bertie"", later - King George VI, as the man who goes through the wide spectrum of emotions, struggling with all sorts of problems and insecurities. The film is based on the true story of the Duke of York, later King George VI, and his meeting with an unorthodox eccentric speech therapist - failed Australian actor Lionel Logue who may not have had the proper credentials but who knew from the experience and long practice how to find the root of the problem and to help his patients.The chemistry between Firth and Jeffrey Rush is simply masterful; both actors make their characters and developing of the unlikely friendship between the King and the commoner believable and totally absorbing. By the time, the King George VI has to give the historical speech on the radio declaring the war on the Nazi Germany, we are totally engrossed in the story and feel how crucial it must be that in the days preceding the ordeal for the whole country, people of England would hear the words of confidence and understanding from their King. When Lionel tells the King just before the recording of the nine minutes speech: ""Talk to me, tell it to me as your friend"", I knew that I was watching the best film of the year. The final scene brought to memory another scene from many years ago, the scene that I consider the top of acting and emotional impact, with Daniel Day Lewis in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot, playing the man who was born with the cerebral palsy and whose body was paralyzed with the exception for his left foot. In the scene that I recall, Day Lewis's character picked up a chalk and started to write a word on the floor. When he finished writing that one word, I knew that I had witnessed not one but three triumphs - the triumph of a human will and spirit, the triumph of the cinema which was able to capture the moment on the film, and the triumph of an actor who did not act but who became the character. It's been many years since I saw My Left Foot and I don't remember experiencing the similar feeling until last Saturday, when I watched a triumphant final to the best film of the year, The King's Speech.Emotional, funny, old-fashioned in the very good sense of the word, The King's Speech is a success of moviemaking. There are so many great aspects to the film that make it very special among the ten very deserving nominees for Best Picture of the year. They are the subtle directing, heartfelt music score, watercolor delicate cinematography, painstakingly recreated realities of the time when England as well as the whole world was on the brink of the devastating war. What make the film enjoyable for many viewers of the different tastes, ages, and preferences, are the masterful combination of historical realism, emotional drama and the elements of the best English comedy. The scenes of speech sessions between Bertie and Lionel were reminiscent, intentionally or not, to the scenes between Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle. The King's Speech is also a love story, or rather two love stories, about two princes who both found the loves of their lives. In case of David, the first born and the heir to the throne, he chose to be with the woman he loved even if it cost him the royal crown. Bertie fell in love with the girl who at the time was considered the ""commoner"" and who had declined his proposal twice being ""afraid never, never again to be free to think, speak and act as I feel I really ought to"". Once accepted, she became the loving wife and mother to their two daughters, his loyal friend, confidant, and supporter. Helena Bonham Carter is very convincing as Duchess of York, later Queen consort Elizabeth. In one of her interviews, the actress said that, ""...she (Elizabeth) was definitely a tower of strength, and everyone says that Bertie could not have been King without her."" I certainly got this feeling from the film.The King's Speech has become one of my very favorite films from last year. it has everything to be loved and admired by the viewers: its story is compelling, moving with the perfect balance of poignant, uplifting, and humorous; the details of the epoch are recreated lovingly and precisely, but most importantly, it is a wonderfully told story of a human condition, of one man who wanted to overcome the obstacles on the way to accomplish his mission as the ruler able to reach out to the millions of people in the speeches that would make all the difference, and how love and support from his Queen, and the friendship, understanding and willing to listen from a ""commoner"" helped him to do so.",5,"""I am the seat of all authority because they think that when I speak, I speak for them.""

1364982,AG8K92N37MT27,B003UESJH4,Garnet,"[0, 0]","I had been wanting to see this movie since it came out, but just never got around to it.  I love the actors in it...Firth, Rush, Bonham-Carter.  As someone who already knows the true story about King George (&#34;Bertie&#34; to his friends and family) and his issues with speech and with never having been expected to take over the throne, this movie just adds potential insight to the reality.  However, it does drag at times and I think it would have been better to show more of the tensions surrounding the royal family in this trying time, especially in light of the rising power of Hitler and the threat of another World War.  I do understand, this was almost a more &#34;personal&#34; movie, but I think that more comparison between the outer and inner life of the Duke/King and his family would have made this a more powerful movie.Some Spoilers:The Duke is second in line to the throne, behind his outspoken brother who, unfortunately, has little time for kingly matters and is busy partying and courting a married-divorced woman who will not suit for being Queen someday.  The current King dispairs of his younger son, especially his inability to speak in public due to a stutter that is a huge problem.  As this is the beginning of radio broadcasts becoming common, this places the Duke at a hugh disadvantage.  He is tried all sorts of odd cures to no result, but his wife finally finds this speach defect therapist in a run-down building and persuades her husband to give it one more go.It's pretty clear that the real issue behind the Duke's problem lies not in his vocal cords, but in his childhood and lack of confidence.  This results in some sad and serious moments as we learn that even if you were raised royal that doesn't mean you had a happy childhood.  But there are also really funny moments as we see that the Duke can certainly swear without stuttering in the least.  Then, of course, the Duke must face his greatest tests as he undegoes the coronation to King and speaking to his people as war is declared with Germany...again.If you enjoy movies set in this time period, you will probably enjoy this movie.  If you like the royals and peeking into their lives--as this is based on a true story--you will probably enjoy this movie.  It can be a bit slow at times, but I was glad I'd finally seen it.  I just doubt I will keep it, as its not really something you'll likely watch again.",3,"A Watcher, Not a Keeper",1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,2411,"['had', 'been', 'wanting', 'see', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'love', 'actors', 'Firth', 'Rush', 'Bonham-Carter', 'someone', 'who', 'already', 'true', 'story', 'King', 'George', '34', 'Bertie', '34', 'friends', 'family', 'issues', 'speech', 'never', 'having', 'been', 'expected', 'take', 'over', 'throne', 'movie', 'just', 'potential', 'insight', 'reality', 'However', 'drag', 'times', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'show', 'more', 'tensions', 'surrounding', 'royal', 'family', 'trying', 'time', 'especially', 'light', 'rising', 'power', 'Hitler', 'threat', 'World', 'War', 'do', 'understand', 'was', 'almost', 'more', '34', 'personal', '34', 'movie', 'think', 'more', 'comparison', 'outer', 'inner', 'life', 'Duke/King', 'family', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'powerful', 'movie.Some', 'Spoilers', 'Duke', 'second', 'line', 'throne', 'outspoken', 'brother', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'little', 'time', 'kingly', 'matters', 'busy', 'partying', 'courting', 'married-divorced', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'suit', 'being', 'Queen', 'someday', 'current', 'King', 'dispairs', 'younger', 'son', 'especially', 'inability', 'speak', 'public', 'due', 'stutter', 'huge', 'problem', 'beginning', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'becoming', 'common', 'Duke', 'hugh', 'disadvantage', 'tried', 'sorts', 'odd', 'cures', 'result', 'wife', 'finally', 'speach', 'defect', 'therapist', 'run-down', 'building', 'husband', 'give', 'one', 'more', 'go.It', 'pretty', 'clear', 'real', 'issue', 'Duke', 'problem', 'not', 'vocal', 'cords', 'childhood', 'lack', 'confidence', 'results', 'sad', 'serious', 'moments', 'learn', 'even', 'were', 'raised', 'royal', ""n't"", 'mean', 'had', 'happy', 'childhood', 'are', 'also', 'really', 'funny', 'moments', 'see', 'Duke', 'can', 'certainly', 'swear', 'stuttering', 'least', 'Then', 'course', 'Duke', 'must', 'face', 'greatest', 'tests', 'coronation', 'King', 'speaking', 'people', 'war', 'declared', 'Germany', 'again.If', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'set', 'time', 'period', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'like', 'royals', 'peeking', 'lives', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'slow', 'times', 'was', 'glad', ""'d"", 'finally', 'seen', 'just', 'doubt', 'will', 'keep', 'not', 'really', 'something', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

1364984,AY12DBB0U420B,B003UESJH4,Gary Peterson,"[3, 3]","I found this DVD on my own DVD shelves and can't recall how it got there. Probably my wife bought it. In any case, it was my late-night movie yesterday and I enjoyed it very much. It's ""The King's Speech"" and stars Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. A little sticker on the DVD case says it received four Academy Awards including best picture. That's easy to understand. This is an exceptionally well done movie and well worth watching.The movie took place in the mid- to late-thirties, just as WWII is getting underway, At that same time, the King of England was fading away and in need of a replacement. The son due to move up was more interested in his twice-divorced wife and abdicated, turning over the throne to the next younger brother who ultimately became King George VI. However, this new-king brother (Bertie) had a life-long speech impediment of badly stammering and stuttering, a rather un-kingly affliction. Bertie had tried numerous therapists, all unsuccessful, but finally settled on an Australian man (Lionel), who, as was later found out, had no official credentials. The story depicted the new king's affliction, his pairing with Lionel, the conflicts that developed and his final triumph and inaugural speech. It's a moving story and quite well done. The settings are magnificent and the photography of such was excellent. The sound score was excellent. As the movie began and went through it's first third, it had the typical stiff and formal British acting and this took a while to adjust to, at least for me. Afterwards, the people became real and quite human. I almost felt that I struggled with the new king as he grappled with handling the language. But finally, there was a triumph. The king stepped out onto a balcony and was greeted by the applause of thousands. It was quite moving.This movie was a very interesting and well done period piece and it's all based on a true story. The settings, costumes and old cars were just magnificent and the film was worth viewing for that alone. However, the story was also quite gripping and the acting was absolutely first rate.Gary Peterson",5,Exceptional Period Piece.

As in his earlier film ""A Single Man"", Colin is staggering as George VI (Bertie to his family and father to the presently reigning Monarch, Elizabeth)  Firth, as in ""A single Man"", gives an outstanding  performance as a ""royal"" that is very content living as  a devoted father and husband enjoying not  having  to be ""in the spotlight"" until all changes with the abdication of his older brother (wonderfully acted by Guy Pierce, starred in ""Percilla queen of the desert),  With that abdication and because of the immense speaking  responsibilities that accompany ""being king"", Bertie has to face his one BIG problem--he has a severe speech impediment and stutters horribly which, of course, does not fit into being a ""good""  Monarch.  How is he going to motivate the masses to be ""strong"" during a major crisis such as World War II?  Stuttering just would not be too ""kingly"" or motivating to the masses.  Thus being the royal that he is, he has got to get help from any source that he can.  His wife (acted fabulously by the unorthodox actress, Helena Carter of ""Room with a view"") finds a ""lower class"" speech therapist, Lionel Logue that is acted sublimely by Geoffrey Rush, of ""Pirates of the Caribbian.  Heated arguments between Bertie and Lionel ensue mainly because Logue feels that Bertie's speech problems are more psychological than physical bring up ""royal family issues"" that Bertie, as a royal, just does not want to admit to (e.g., his father and older brother were rather overbearing and not too nice to him) Added to the fact that Lionel is not afraid to ask some ""deep ""and seemly impertinent  questions about the Royal Family that Bertie is very uncomfortable about answering, plus  he does not want to differentiate to Bertie  because he is king--he refuses to call him ""sir"" just Bertie.All-in-all, ""King's Speech"" is really a very good film. The direction, recreation of the era and, most of all, the acting is tremendous.  (I really enjoyed seeing Derek Jacoby of ""I Claudius"" fame in the small role of the archbishop.I must also mention that in the very small role of Bertie's father, George V, actor Michael Gambon  is so very good that he almost ""blows"" all of the other actors off the screen.

1364990,A3MT0YM4LU0AT2,B003UESJH4,G. HOLMES,"[3, 4]","What a wonderful film this is.  Extraordinary performances from the usual crowd of British actors from the Theahahtter"" (pronounce this word  - `Theater' with a frightfully posh accent), who condescend to step down from the boards from time to time, and put a performance down on film for the money -or for posterity - from time to time.  Yet here are performances that left me in awe. Acting of this stature is really a craft that must take years of training to return performances of this standard.My old mother tells me frequently (Just don't get her started on The WAR!) that as a 20-year old; that during a particularly heavy air raid on my home town, a mine had dropped into her street of terraced houses.  Fortunately, it went off with more of a crump than a bang but was sufficient to blow out all the windows of the houses in the street and burst the water main.  My mother had to struggle to work for her fourteen-hour shift making surgical field dressings for the military: As was her usual routine, and as was expected - turn up for ""War Work"" - or else.  She couldn't bathe or fix her make-up or do any of the usually girlie stuff before the ""All Clear"" sounded, and she could set off in the winter darkness to catch her tram.  Feeling thoroughly miserable as can be imagined in the circumstances, having to pick her way through the rubble and debris she made her way to work just as dawn was breaking.  During her mid-day break for lunch she slipped out of the plant to do some shopping where she encountered a small group of exited people causing something of a stir.  Thinking that the firemen and ARP wardens must have discovered something horrible in a bombed-out building; she shuddered and had intended headed off in the opposite direction.  It was then that she had the shock of her life.  There before her stood - the King and the Queen!  There they were.  Unbelievable!  They were probably two of the most famous people in the whole world outside of Hitler and Churchill at that stage of WW2.  King George VI in uniform and Queen Elizabeth dressed in all her jewels, furs and finery, treading carefully through the rubble of shattered buildings. Accompanied by only a couple off plain-clothed police officers they had come to visit and hopefully raise the morale of the ordinary people struggling through such a devastating trial. They must have succeeded brilliantly because if my family were anything to go by then King George and Queen Elizabeth must have been deeply revered during, and after the war.  I personally have no recollection of the King.  One of my earliest memories is of the coronation; but I did meet the late Queen Mother once which was a mighty fine experience and an unforgettable episode that made a great impression on me at the time.  I still miss the old ""Queen Mum"".  So you see - I had broken my usual habit of waiting until the DVD comes out, and went watch this new film in a cinema instead - such was my eagerness to see it.  This will be one of those rare movies that I can watch over and over again and find something new to appreciate that I had never noticed before.

But the success of this extraordinary film does not stop there.  This re-telling of history as written by David Seidler and as directed with enormous sensitivity by Tom Hooper, as captured on film by cinematographer Danny Cohen glows as a background for some of the finest acting before the public today.The film opens in 1925 as King George V (Michael Gambon) is beginning to fail, leaving the heir apparent to the throne at the time of his death to be Edward VIII (Guy Pearce), a man more concerned with love with the twice divorced Wallis Simpson (Eve Best) than he is with the Royal Lineage.  Once the now senile George V dies, Edward VIII takes the throne but soon abdicates to marry Wallis.  This passes the throne to the tender but severely stammering Prince Albert  (Colin Firth), a man terrified of facing his beloved countrymen because of his speech defect - a defect that his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) has encouraged him to correct through a series of speech doctors.  Elizabeth hears of  Australian &eacute;migr&eacute; Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a poor wannabe actor who gained his knowledge for correcting speech defects teaching returning WW I victims in Australia.  Prince Albert  (Bertie) and Logue meet and begin therapy by Logue's tough rules before Albert takes the throne.  Through a series of rigorous exercises and lessons Logue helps the Prince learn to speak, finally accompanying him to the throne as a speech therapist and giving Bertie (now known as King George VI)  the courage and strength to rise to the occasion of leading England through WW II.Though the above is a brief synopsis of the story, the real message of the film deals with the gradual building of a close friendship between Bertie and Logue - or between royalty and commoner.  The manner in which Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush create this memorable relationship represents some of the finest acting in cinema history.  The very large cast includes such luminaries as Claire Bloom as Queen Mary, Derek Jacobi as Archbishop Cosmo Lang, Jennifer Ehle as Logue's wife, Timothy Spall in a brilliant turn as Winston Churchill, Anthony Andrews as Stanley Baldwin, and Roger Parrott as Neville Chamberlain.  Alexandre Desplat provides the original music allow heavy portions of Beethoven's 7th Symphony and Emperor Concerto (with Steven Osborne as piano soloist).

Well, you can go ahead and throw that out the window because director Tom Hooper has delivered a crowd-pleaser if ever I've seen one. The story of King George VI and his determination to conquer his severe stammer, aided by his quirky speech therapist, Lionel Logue, is the feel-good film of the year. Brilliantly realized by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, both characters spring to life with the sort of enthusiasm that you can practically feel through the screen. While at first it may appear that this is yet another in a long line of stuffy aristocratic historical dramas, the truth is that The King's Speech is as much a comedy as anything. At the risk of losing what credibility I have, I dare to use one of the great clich&eacute;s--a triumph of the human spirit--because there really is no better way to describe the film and the feelings it arouses.The film opens with Albert George (Firth), the Duke of York (for he has not yet taken the throne), preparing to address the crowd before the 1925 Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium. His stammering speech has a visibly unsettling effect the listeners in attendance and we see this problem extend to his home life, where he struggles to tell his daughters a bedtime story. At the behest of his wife, Elizabeth (the excellent Helena Bonhom Carter), Albert begins taking lessons with a goofy speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Rush). It was around this time that the radio began to play a large part in the British monarchy, with the prospect of regular radio addresses looming in the near future. As King George V declines in health and eventually dies, the crown is passed to Albert's brother Edward (convincingly played by the great Guy Pearce); however it soon becomes clear that the hard-partying Edward has no interest in being King, and he eventually runs off to marry the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson, abdicating the throne and thrusting the responsibility to the understandably terrified Albert. Upon declaration of war with Germany, Albert, now King George VI, is given a three-page speech to read over the radio. This is the titular speech and serves as the culmination of a long struggle between Albert and Lionel. The journey these two men take to this famous moment is chronicled with tenderness, wit, and humor, transforming what could have been a rather dull and dreary story into an uplifting and wildly entertaining one.As mentioned above, the reason The King's Speech works so well resides with the two leads. Geoffrey Rush does what he always does, effortlessly imbuing the character with multiple layers and idiosyncrasies that culminate in a character that is both humorous and stern, believable and wonderful. It is the kind of performance that Rush is now know for, but that doesn't diminish its impact. As good as Rush is, Colin Firth is even better; building off of his fantastic work in last year's A Single Man, Firth tackles what may be the most difficult role of his career and comes up aces. He takes on the challenge, not only of portraying a king (with living relatives, as his daughter went on to become Queen Elizabeth II), but a king with a severe speech impediment. It's easy to imagine the role becoming grating for audiences, but it is a credit to Firth and director Tom Hooper that the film rises above what in hindsight seems a petty concern by resisting the urge to tone down the king's stammer. The struggle and consternation is plainly seen on Firth's face and the audience will empathize with him, regardless of their own speech habits. It is the crowning achievement of Colin Firth's career, and he will most certainly be rewarded by the Academy.With all of that said, I must confess that The King's Speech didn't take hold of me in the way that films like Black Swan, The Social Network, and The Fighter did. I chalk it up to my own personal viewing preferences, as there is nary a fault to be found in Tom Hooper's film. The King's Speech contains excellent performances (most notably by the two brilliant lead actors), sterling production values, assured direction, and a humorous and measured screenplay. It may sound like a simple story about one man helping another with his stammer, but the film somehow transcends its subject matter and stands as one of the better films of the year. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",4,Not your typical stuffy British period piece,1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,4447,"['do', ""n't"", 'typically', 'go', 'Oscar', 'bait', 'centered', 'British', 'Aristocracy', 'not', 'really', 'thing', 'too', 'stuffy', 'self-important', 'Well', 'can', 'go', 'ahead', 'throw', 'out', 'window', 'director', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'delivered', 'crowd-pleaser', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'story', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'determination', 'conquer', 'severe', 'stammer', 'aided', 'quirky', 'speech', 'therapist', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'feel-good', 'film', 'year', 'Brilliantly', 'realized', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'characters', 'spring', 'life', 'sort', 'enthusiasm', 'can', 'practically', 'feel', 'screen', 'first', 'may', 'appear', 'yet', 'long', 'line', 'stuffy', 'aristocratic', 'historical', 'dramas', 'truth', 'King', 'Speech', 'as', 'much', 'comedy', 'anything', 'risk', 'losing', 'what', 'credibility', 'have', 'dare', 'use', 'one', 'great', 'clich', 'eacute', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'really', 'better', 'way', 'describe', 'film', 'feelings', 'film', 'opens', 'Albert', 'George', 'Firth', 'Duke', 'York', 'not', 'yet', 'taken', 'throne', 'preparing', 'address', 'crowd', '1925', 'Empire', 'Exhibition', 'Wembley', 'Stadium', 'stammering', 'speech', 'visibly', 'unsettling', 'effect', 'listeners', 'attendance', 'see', 'problem', 'extend', 'home', 'life', 'where', 'tell', 'daughters', 'bedtime', 'story', 'behest', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'excellent', 'Helena', 'Bonhom', 'Carter', 'Albert', 'taking', 'lessons', 'goofy', 'speech', 'therapist', 'named', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'Rush', 'was', 'time', 'radio', 'began', 'play', 'large', 'part', 'British', 'monarchy', 'prospect', 'regular', 'radio', 'addresses', 'looming', 'near', 'future', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'health', 'eventually', 'dies', 'crown', 'passed', 'Albert', 'brother', 'Edward', 'convincingly', 'played', 'great', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'however', 'soon', 'clear', 'hard-partying', 'Edward', 'interest', 'being', 'King', 'eventually', 'marry', 'twice-divorced', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'abdicating', 'throne', 'thrusting', 'responsibility', 'understandably', 'terrified', 'Albert', 'declaration', 'war', 'Germany', 'Albert', 'now', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'given', 'three-page', 'speech', 'read', 'radio', 'titular', 'speech', 'serves', 'culmination', 'long', 'struggle', 'Albert', 'Lionel', 'journey', 'two', 'men', 'take', 'famous', 'moment', 'chronicled', 'tenderness', 'wit', 'humor', 'transforming', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'dull', 'dreary', 'story', 'uplifting', 'wildly', 'entertaining', 'one.As', 'mentioned', 'reason', 'King', 'Speech', 'so', 'well', 'two', 'leads', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'what', 'always', 'effortlessly', 'imbuing', 'character', 'multiple', 'layers', 'idiosyncrasies', 'culminate', 'character', 'humorous', 'stern', 'believable', 'wonderful', 'kind', 'performance', 'Rush', 'now', 'know', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'impact', 'As', 'good', 'Rush', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'even', 'better', 'building', 'fantastic', 'work', 'last', 'year', 'A', 'Single', 'Man', 'Firth', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'difficult', 'role', 'career', 'up', 'aces', 'challenge', 'not', 'only', 'portraying', 'king', 'living', 'relatives', 'daughter', 'went', 'become', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'king', 'severe', 'speech', 'impediment', 'easy', 'imagine', 'role', 'becoming', 'grating', 'audiences', 'credit', 'Firth', 'director', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'film', 'what', 'hindsight', 'petty', 'concern', 'resisting', 'urge', 'tone', 'down', 'king', 'stammer', 'struggle', 'consternation', 'plainly', 'seen', 'Firth', 'face', 'audience', 'will', 'empathize', 'regardless', 'own', 'speech', 'habits', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'career', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'be', 'rewarded', 'Academy.With', 'said', 'must', 'confess', 'King', 'Speech', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'hold', 'way', 'films', 'Black', 'Swan', 'Social', 'Network', 'Fighter', 'did', 'chalk', 'own', 'personal', 'viewing', 'preferences', 'nary', 'fault', 'be', 'found', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'film', 'King', 'Speech', 'excellent', 'performances', 'most', 'notably', 'two', 'brilliant', 'lead', 'actors', 'sterling', 'production', 'values', 'assured', 'direction', 'humorous', 'measured', 'screenplay', 'may', 'sound', 'simple', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'helping', 'stammer', 'film', 'somehow', 'subject', 'matter', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'year', '4.5', '5', 'stars']",N/A

1365002,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B003UESJH4,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[0, 0]","My review was written after viewing this remarkable movie on opening day at the theater. It was sensed then that it would be a contender (winner) of Best Picture. Now the DVD is available. I buy it to again view this winner; a movie my wife wants to watch daily. The music is as good as the acting and story.The DVD provides SUBTITLES and an all film extra bonus assortment that is as great as the feature itself, also about as long. A comentary version, a filmed story about this Inspirational time and people, a Q&A; filmed program with the director and several of the cast, 2 real King Geo VI speeches showing that Firth did an even more remarkable job as portraying Bertie, a filmed story about the real Lionel Logue with surprising details and information, and even an emotional plug in video form from the Stuttering Foundation. All worth a look. The bonus material is worth the purchase price.Review from the theater viewing:This movie removes the chasm between the Monarch and common people. An emotional look at a personal struggle of the man who would become king. A speech defect is the problem. King Geo VI role and literally his life is so well played by Colin Firth (well known for many British period dramas) that the viewer becomes a part of the close family of this man and his strife. You will feel an abundance of emotional elements, sadness to laughter.Firth will no doubt continue to win awards for this portrayal, but another man deserves as much. Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue, the man who helped the king speak, is as endearing in his performance as Firth. Helen Bonham Carter makes a beautiful, loving, supportive wife, and eventual Queen Elizabeth. Although the part is small for an actor giant like Derek Jacobi, he plays a memorable Archbishop. Jacobi is better known as Cadfael, a period series worth a viewing.One does not have to be British, a scholar of the Monarchy, or even a lover of period drama to enjoy this film. It is an inspirational tale of accepting, facing, and overcoming a handicap. That is never out of date, never old. ""The King's Speech"" is the freshest approach to the task as I have seen. It is also one of the best Monarchy stories I have viewed, and I'm a Brit History DVD fan and own dozens upon dozens.The theater viewing audience cheered and clapped for this film through the end credits.

1365003,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003UESJH4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 5]","- Logue: ""Please don't do that. I believe sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.""- Bertie: ""My physicians say it relaxes me.""- Logue: ""They're idiots.""- Bertie: ""They've all been knighted.""- Logue: ""Makes it official then.""At a time when the British empire teetered on the brink of war, a monarch perceived as flawed would have been detrimental as fudge. The years leading up to this had the declining King George V (Michael Gambon) condemning one son, Edward, Duke of Windsor, for plunging the crown into a royal family scandal. The king had also been long frustrated with his second son, Albert (or ""Bertie"" to his inner circle), the Duke of York, who suffers from a lifelong debilitating speech impediment. Public speeches are nightmarish endeavors for Albert, and Colin Firth is so good here that he immediately draws you into Bertie's mortifying deaths in the limelight. Perhaps no one cursed the advent of live radio more vigorously than this stuttering royal. But it must be true that someone always profits from another's misery. Colin Firth deservedly won an Oscar for playing the tortured Duke of York.Albert's boon lies in his wife Elizabeth (a superb Helena Bonham Carter) who stands by him indefatigably, with kindness and understanding. Her unrelenting efforts to help him with his malady at last produces the eccentric Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush, again remarkable). As Albert would later remark of Logue: ""No training, no diploma, no... qualifications... Just... a great deal of nerve."" That sums the Aussie up.In 1936 Edward ascended the throne after the passing of his father, King George V. However, he abdicated later that year in light of his controversial romancing of the American commoner Wallis Simpson whom he wanted to marry (and who is adept with ""certain skills acquired in Shanghai""). Sucks for Bertie who now reluctantly assumes the tarnished crown, the sovereignty having very much fallen out of favor with the masses. And then 1939 swings around.This movie engrossed me. It's close to a perfect movie, in my opinion. THE KING'S SPEECH is a triumph of superb acting; it is a precise character study. But that sounds too clinical. There is also warmth and surprising humor and an understated love story. THE KING'S SPEECH sheds a light on a historical footnote - concerning Bertie's stammer - long overshadowed by Edward's scandalous gallivanting. THE KING'S SPEECH focuses most on the sometimes strained relationship between Bertie and Logue as they work to counter Bertie's stutter. Logue's methodology is unorthodox. No predictable marbles in the mouth for Logue, or tired elocution drills. Instead, he espouses breathing exercises and physical exertions and verbal trickeration (such as rolling one word into the next). He also requires intimacy from his patients. Logue is a contrary cuss and insists on being on familiar terms with Albert, calling him ""Bertie."" You can imagine Albert's royal indignation. One of the film's many monumental moments surfaces when Albert plays the record of his recital of a Shakespearean piece. What he hears astounds him and convinces him to stick it out with Logue. This is how an unlikely lifelong friendship is forged.In 1939, Britain entered into war with Germany. Although more a figurehead than a real power, Albert - now formally called King George VI - still has a responsibility to the people. To rally a beleaguered kingdom, to represent steadfast resistance in the face of a great and oncoming evil, Bertie must speak to his subjects, and speak with resolve and with clarity and certainly without stammer. The film climaxes with King George VI's famous radio broadcast on September 3, 1939 as he prepares Britain for them dark days ahead, as war looms ominously. It's a sequence confined for the most part to a claustrophobic room which holds the king and his nemesis (a microphone) and a calmly orchestrating Logue. It's been a while since I've sat thru a sequence more mesmerizing and more fraught with nervous tension. It was electric. THE KING'S SPEECH, stirring and passionate and very much a humanizing portrait of a flawed but brave and decent king, is required viewing. If nothing else, you get to see a Helena Bonham Carter that doles out patience and compassion. How rare a role is that for her?The DVD's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary with director Tom Hooper- ""An Inspirational Story of an Unlikely Friendship"" - the Making Of featurette (00:23:39 minutes)- Onstage Q & A Panel with the Director & Cast including Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter(00:22:01 minutes)- Two Speeches from the real King George VI: the pre-war speech (radio broadcast September 3, 1939) and the post-war speech (Newsreel May 14, 1945)- The Real Lionel Logue Highlights - author Mark Logue talks about his grandfather, Lionel Logue (00:10:34 minutes)- PSA: The Stuttering Foundation",5,"""So here I am.

A loving but frustrated wife seeks help from a speech therapist for her husband, whose severe stammer has defied treatment by renowned specialists.  The new therapist, who uses unorthodox techniques, manages not quite to turn the man into an orator for the ages, but to make him a comfortable private conversationalist and a credible public speaker.Of course, the man will become the King of England, and his speeches will encourage and comfort a nation during an all-consuming war that shaped what it was next to become.  That, perhaps, is what first packed movie houses for this small little British set piece.And packed they should have been.  This movie is a masterwork.  It does take some forgivable dramatic liberties, though.  When Lionel Logue first met the Duke of York, he was already more successful than the sets for his office and flat would suggest.  And he worked with the Duke for more than a decade before ""Bertie"" became King George VI and the stakes of the game soared as the King tried to restore dignity to a crown that had been sullied by his brother's pro-Nazi shenanigans and self-indulgent involvement with Wallis Simpson.No matter.  Filmmaking just doesn't get any better.  And in this one, it's all about the actors.Colin Firth is an actor I have always liked but also found a bit disappointing in his choice of roles.  He had settled into too comfortable a groove as a pompous twit whose humanity is slowly called forth by surrounding people and circumstances.  True, he played some of these roles to near-perfection, such as Mr. Darcy in A&E;'s stupendous ""Pride and Prejudice"".  But now I realize that God must have been using these roles to prepare Mr. Firth for this role-of-a-lifetime as King George VI.  It is truly one of the finest performances I have ever seen an actor deliver on a screen.Then there is Geoffrey Rush.  As Lionel Logue, he strikes a perfect note as the Australian provincial who must force his way into a fortress of British snobbery and regal reserve to deliver his ministrations to a lonely, emotionally-abused man who is being forced onto a stage that terrifies him.  Lionel Logue was a humorous, gentle humanitarian who used his fees from the British upper crust to fund his charitable work for the poor.  The writers, director, and Rush take the more subtle tack of bringing these traits forward in the charming scenes where Logue stages a bit of theatrical horseplay with his sons and where he and the King press themselves against the wall to hide from a wife (played by the wonderful Jennifer Ehle) who comes home unexpectedly to find the Queen of England sitting at her dining table.Then there is Helena Bonham-Carter who, as Queen Elizabeth, was spot on in portraying the remarkable woman who combined regality with compassionate earthiness to make her a rallying point for the British during World War II and a veritable cult figure to a later generation, who admired her heart, her humor, and, ultimately, her astonishing longevity.I could go on, as the entire cast was beyond reproach.

His own agony was conveyed, in my view, more by how others reacted to him (rather than him reflecting on his own dread) as he made speeches. I used to have nightmares about the following morning when I would have to stand and say ""present"" at school assembly. I used to agonise (jump with panic even) when a `phone rang and I was the nearest to answer. Things have certainly improved to the point that I now have a solid history of presenting technical papers at international events.

And that couldn't be more fair.  This is a great movie.

I read somewhere that Firth in preparing for his role found them so as well.)

Geoffrey Rush as his unorthodox speech therapist, Lionel Logue, and Helena Bonham Carter as his wife are almost as good.  I also liked how The King's Speech upends the conventional wisdom about his brother and Mrs. Wallis Simpson who, far from being noble for choosing love over the throne, are portrayed as fatuous and selfish.  Not being a scholar of British royalty, I'm not sure whether this is a more accurate take than the conventional one, but I appreciated the different view.  My only quibble -- the climatic address to the nation plays too long and does conveniently overlook the apparent historical reality that Logue's work with the King's public speaking began long before that.

'The King's Speech' like 'The Social Network' has been generating so much buzz it's almost silly. Thankfully, like 'The Social Network' 'The King's Speech' is more than worthy of it's praise and while some might disagree with it being called the BEST film it's easily my favorite from 2010.The King's Speech takes place in England in the years before WWII. These are the days before TV where public speaking on the radio was necessary and Prince Albert has an impediment which causes his voice to stammer. Albert's wife, Elizabeth takes him to see Australian speech-expert Lionel Logue who's also trying to make it as an amateur actor. The film focuses both on the relationships between Prince Albert and his family and his friendship with Lionel. Albert soon becomes King George VI and must be prepared to speak to his country before going to war with Germany. The film is very well paced and carries a very warm-hearted tone with some minor political and family situations and even welcome (and surprising) moments of humor.The cast really couldn't be better. Colin Firth is a wonderful actor and really makes us care about Prince Albert (or 'Bertie') and his family. Geoffrey Rush is fantastic as Lionel Logue and his moments with Bertie are both energetic, touching, and drop-dead hilarious! Helena Bonham-Carter is just as wonderful and couldn't have been better cast as the Duchess of York (and then Queen). Michael Gambon appears briefly but memorably as George V and the usually comedic Timothy Spall is surprisingly effective as Winston Churchill. Like Colin Firth, Guy Pearce doesn't bear much physical resemblance to his character: Edward VIII and his characterization along with that of his mistress may seem a bit shallow but they suit the film well.'The King's Speech' is far from a perfect film. It can be slow at times and it makes a lot of the same points on more than one occasion. However the movie is so entertaining and has so much emotion resonating from it that by the end I honestly didn't care about it's short-comings. It's a wonderful film and despite it's ""R"" rating is more than appropriate for the PG-13 crowd (there are a few BRIEF instances of the ""F"" word but none of it in exploitive or sexual context).

Hoyos,"[1, 2]","Bertie, soon to be King George VI of England, should have joined a Toastmasters International club and he probably would have overcome his fear of public speaking like I did.  Instead, Bertie visits a controversial speech therapist, Lionel Logue, who helped many shell shocked soldiers to speak again.  Through the use of cursing, singing and dancing, Lionel helps Bertie to overcome his stuttering and deliver one of the most important speeches in history.  Consequently, the two of them develop a lifelong friendship.Tom Hooper's ""The King's Speech"" is a highly emotional historical drama which greatly surpassed my expectations.  World War II looms like a dark cloud over all of England.  The elderly king has died, the oldest prince relinquishes the throne because of a sex scandal, and the youngest prince, Bertie (Colin Firth), is forced to become something he has always feared and dreaded.  With the patient, long-suffering guidance of Lionel (Geoffrey Rush) and the loving support of his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), Bertie is able to overcome his fears and insecurities.Friendship and love are important themes throughout ""The King's Speech.""  The royal family is a shockingly dysfunctional one.  Bertie aptly described it when he said, ""We're not a family.  We're a firm.""  As a child, Bertie was emotionally abused by an overbearing, perfectionist father and a cruel, mocking brother.  Lionel's life hasn't been entirely fulfilling either; he yearns to become a Shakespearean actor but has become too old for the lead roles.  Through their friendship, the two men learn to overcome their obstacles; they are given new purposes in life.The costumes, sets, music and acting for ""The King's Speech"" are positively superb.  They helped to transport me back in time to a pre-World War II Britain when Adolph Hitler is threatening England with his troops.  I became extremely teary eyed while listening to the king's dramatic speech announcing England's entry into the dreaded war.  I felt as though I too was a citizen living at that time.  Fear and dread coursed through my body.  During the speech, I also wondered what would happen if the President of the United States gave a similar speech in the present.  Again, I shivered with fear at the thought and prayed that would never happen in my lifetime.  The pain, suffering and destruction brought on by war truly unnerves me.""The King's Speech"" gave me a reason to be afraid; I feared the threat of impending war.  However, it also gave me a reason to rejoice; I rejoiced  over friendships found and loves renewed.  And the beautiful qualities of love and friendship can help us overcome our deepest fears, even our fears of war and death.  It is no wonder that ""The King's Speech"" won four Academy Awards.  I only hope that Tom Hooper can direct more films of this grand magnitude.  I only wish that the language could've been toned down so that younger audiences could watch it.  ""The King's Speech"" is a film that should be viewed by all young people for its historical significance and its emphasis on friendship and love.Joseph B.

First of all, it's not hard to guess how the film ends, as we have never heard of a blown speech of historic proportions. Second, for Americans anyway, the story of King George VI (Liz's Dad), is all but unknown. Then too, the pre-war world, in which the words of kings and queens mattered, is a bit out of reach for most modern viewers Yet in spite of these formidable hurdles, ""The King's Speech"" conveys the mindset of the age and makes the audience feel it as well. All it takes are small actions -- Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Mary recoiling just slightly when approached by a commoner; the King's irrational rage at being called by his nickname. The movie also avoids the urge to tart up its subject with gratuitous action. The film is taut and plays close to the vest - taking place as a battle of one man's will against another's and of a man's battle against his own deep-seated fears.At times, the film veered dangerously close to the realm of psychodrama, nearly suggesting that the poor king had only to spill his guts about his miserable childhood in order to be freed from his speech defect. And I don't think that a few shots of bombs and flying aircraft would have hurt. But these are niggling complaints.Colin Firth gave a controlled and intense performance as the king.

1365043,A37NODCIL8PP75,B003UESJH4,"Jeannette Belliveau ""Author, Writer, Editor, ...","[1, 2]","""The King's Speech"" strings together jewel-like sequences like beads on a chain, such that the moviemaking and ensemble acting on view is perhaps stronger than significane of the historical event depicted, though the importance of kingly speeches during war is not to be dismissed.On first viewing, ""The King's Speech"" falls into the category of a historical British import, in the spirit of the Merchant-Ivory offerings of the 1980s and 1990s, with older versions of Merchant-Ivory ensembles -- Derek Jacoby as the archbishop of Canterbury, Helena Bonham Carter as Bertie's wife, Timothy Spall as Churchill, and so forth. You settle back for the plot to unfold, and as the Colin Firth notes (paraphrasing) on the DVD extras, to whit: Prince meets speech therapist, prince loses speech therapist, prince regains speech therapist.On second viewing, the beautiful construction of the film becomes apparent. We have no chronological jumps. Each sequence is self-contained and flows into the next. We start with an innocent enough event: Bertie (Colin Firth), the son of King George V, needs to give a speech to close an exhibition at Wembley. He walks with the good cheer of a condemned man down corridors, up a stairs and out to the terrace to address the waiting multitudes. He stammers and pauses and creates discomfort and fidgeting in the audience. Unknown to him, and to the viewer at this early juncture in the audience, an Australian actor with success in helping stammerers is in onlooking crowd. And his son is going to lean over and ask him, ""Do you think you can help that man?""Bertie, who would later become King George VI, didn't have any inkling that he would in effect have to stand up to Hitler and help Winston Churchill rally a nation. His wife, Elizabeth, the mother of Princesses Elizabeth and Ann, finds Lionel Logue, a speech therapist and not the first, to help her husband. She's unaware of the machinations of the head of the therapist society to have Logue's name advanced to help Bertie. Her timing is fantastic, as history is about to require a more brave if less eloquent ascender to the throne than Bertie's brother Edward, who would eventually abdicate to marry Wallis Simpson.Along the way, we have fantastic casting at every corner: Australian Geoffrey Rush as Logue, Michael Gambon as Bertie's father, George V; the finest actors of the British stage of the last two generations appear here. Finely honed scriptwriting brings us peak scenes as when Logue says sternly, ""My game, my turf, my rules"" to the prince on his first testy visit, as Logue tries to establish ""trust and total equality in the safety of my consultation room."" Firth skillfully establishes Bertie's pride, disarming charm and difficult side when he blurts ""one of my many faults!"" when Logue calls him on his temper.Sets are intriguing: Logue's house has explosive and strange merled painting on the walls, and the young princesses Ann and Elizabeth a stableful of wooden horses in a scene of comforting domesticity. The BBC's broadcasting station feeds royal speeches to every corner of empire, with wire boxes labeled Antigua, Kenya and so forth. A stroll in Regent's Park is London as a fairy tale.A subtheme in the film is the role of family: Bertie tells a charming tale of a penguin to his daughters, complete with subtle wit, improvisation and stammer. Logue is an equally engaged father, who plays ""guess the Shakespeare play"" with his boys (""Time for Shakes, Dad?""). These domestic scenes contrast with Bertie's confession to Logue that he was closest to his nannies, ""but not the first,"" who pinched him and did not feed him, a deficiency not noted by his parents for three years.The core of the movie of course are the sparks that fly as Logue tries to cut down a prince to be his equal, and Bertie fights back fiercely, over everything from whether Bertie can smoke in Logue's office to whether first names are acceptable. There's subtle drama as Bertie reads Shakespeare while wearing headphones that blast music to calm his tongue. The two fight stormily and make up. Once back on track learning the tricks of public speaking, Bertie attempts strenuous exercises, including rolling on the carpet, to learn how to relax the body, diaphragm and throat.Logue carries secrets that come to light after digging by the appalled archbishop, but he staunchly defends his methods and himself with great aplomb. With so many beautiful scenes here, multiple viewings may be rewarding. ""The King's Speech"" serves as a primer on moviemaking and learning from history, without an explosion or CGI effect in sight; or perhaps only a few, such as rendering crowd scenes at Wembley and outside Buckingham Palace.The film has peaks when Bertie and Logue first meet, when Logue roars back a defense when the king's associates attack him, and when Bertie -- prepped and morally supported by Logue -- makes a pivotal speech when England declares war on Nazi Germany. Enjoy each scene unfurling as Bertie finds a second friend -- to equal the friendship with his wife - in his evolution from lonely lad to competent king.",5,"A sequence of jewel-like scenes, inspired

It isn't that I find that having a monarchy a necessary thing, however, that said, there are many things that the rest of the population isn't aware of that go on in the life of anyone who happens to be born into that life.  It isn't all glamor and luxury, as it appears from the outside, these people often live very unhappy lives, because they are loyal to the duties that are placed upon them from birth.  No, I am not from England, I just am very empathetic with anyone in a position of power and what the responsibility entails, especially when as in England, the position isn't always sought after, as was the case with King Edward VI.  And no, the things that he speaks of during his childhood, that clearly caused his stammering, are NOT  irrelevant.  they illustrate my very point.  Like the monarchy or anything about it or not, you can at least take from the film, an example of what any ordinary person may go through who has had similar problems growing up.  I personally know someone who has a speech impediment caused by child abuse.  It has affected him his entire life.  But back to the film, I found Colin Firth to be very effective in his roll as the speech therapist.  He was likable and believable and an interesting personality.  I found Geoffrey Rush to be a very compelling character.  I liked him very much and he was entirely believable in his personality and his interaction with the speech therapist.  Not too touchy feely, as hollywood likes to get with these kind of parts.  That would have been entirely unbelievable in this setting.  Helena Bonham Carter was also good in her roll as the kings wife.  It illustrates that not all in the royal circle are stuffy and stiff.The film is a true story, which I especially like to watch, in this day of make believe and so much fluff and no substance or anything of any value to say at all.  This story, outlines a very important time in world history, the dawning of WWII.  It does this very briefly, but never the less, it adds to the weight of the entire story, of a man thrust into the roll of King, in a country who played a crucial roll in whipping the Nazis ass.

It tells the story of how King George VI gained confidence in himself and was able to speak to the British people in their moment of crisis.  Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and Helena Bonham Carter are outstanding actors in this movie and the plot is excellent.  I wont go into the details since it has been written numerous times in past reviews.  I just want to say I know the difficulties that George VI went thru in his life due to his stammering and sometimes stuttering when he talked.  When I was young I had the same problem and thanks to two speech therapists I was able to use strategies in talking and it greatly gained my self confidence.  This movie shows that a huge problem of George VI was he was suffering from low self-esteem due to his father George V and his brother Edward VIII.  Both mocked him and made him feel less of a man and a prince.  Due to George VI speech therapist George was able to control (mostly) his stammering when he had to make speeches to the British people live or on the radio.The root of his stammering problem was due to the harsh mental environment George VI went thru in his younger life, and he didn't realize this until his speech therapist helped him discover that.

Cofield,"[3, 4]","The King's Speech is an extremely touching and satisfying look at the struggles of Prince Albert, Duke of York and second son of King George V, with a severe stammer that made it almost impossible for him to speak in public.  This made his royal duties torturous and agonizing, for the Duke as well as for his listeners.  Fortunately, the Duke (known as Bertie to his family) had an advocate: his wife Elizabeth.  Elizabeth tracked down Lionel Logue, an Australian speech therapist who managed, over a period of years, to help Bertie overcome much of his speech difficulties.  This became even more important in 1936, when Bertie's older brother suddenly abdicated the throne, forcing him to become King George VI.This movie is a magnificent historical tale combined with deep human drama.  The stellar cast does an impressive job recreating the world of the 1930s, with Britain in economic depression and facing a rising threat from Nazi Germany. Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter do an especially fine job as George VI and Queen Elizabeth, which is important because there are fewer and fewer Britons still living who can remember him, while most people remember the late Queen Mother as a befeathered and bejeweled old lady smiling and waving.  The story of the King and Queen's great struggles and the work they put in to speak for and inspire the British people during some of their darkest hours deserves to be better known, and The King's Speech does much to make that possible.",5,The Man Behind The Crown.,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,1488,"['King', 'Speech', 'extremely', 'touching', 'satisfying', 'look', 'struggles', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'Duke', 'York', 'second', 'son', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'severe', 'stammer', 'made', 'almost', 'impossible', 'speak', 'public', 'made', 'royal', 'duties', 'torturous', 'agonizing', 'Duke', 'as', 'well', 'listeners', 'Fortunately', 'Duke', 'known', 'Bertie', 'family', 'had', 'advocate', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Elizabeth', 'tracked', 'down', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'Australian', 'speech', 'therapist', 'who', 'managed', 'period', 'years', 'help', 'Bertie', 'overcome', 'much', 'speech', 'difficulties', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'important', '1936', 'when', 'Bertie', 'older', 'brother', 'suddenly', 'abdicated', 'throne', 'forcing', 'become', 'King', 'George', 'VI.This', 'movie', 'magnificent', 'historical', 'tale', 'combined', 'deep', 'human', 'drama', 'stellar', 'cast', 'impressive', 'job', 'recreating', 'world', '1930s', 'Britain', 'economic', 'depression', 'facing', 'rising', 'threat', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'do', 'especially', 'fine', 'job', 'George', 'VI', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'important', 'are', 'fewer', 'fewer', 'Britons', 'still', 'living', 'who', 'can', 'remember', 'most', 'people', 'remember', 'late', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'befeathered', 'bejeweled', 'old', 'lady', 'smiling', 'waving', 'story', 'King', 'Queen', 'great', 'struggles', 'work', 'put', 'speak', 'inspire', 'British', 'people', 'darkest', 'hours', 'be', 'better', 'known', 'King', 'Speech', 'much', 'make', 'possible']",N/A

The story is low-key and pretty well-known to any student of British history. The abdication of Edward VIII has been covered many times, though this is the first movie I've seen that covered it from George VI's point of view. Anyone who wants high drama or intrigue had better look elsewhere.The reason to watch this film is the acting. Now and then it happens that a group of actors at the peak of their form come together in a film and this is such an occasion. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are simply brilliant in their roles. It's arbitrary to call Firth the leading actor and Rush the support, because both dominate the screen and, as Rush's Logue says, in his rooms they are equals. Firth perhaps has the more difficult role, because he has to play a man who stutters but doesn't want to- it's so much easier to look like an actor playing someone who stutters. He is so convincing that I, in common with others who watched the movie, was saying the words for him and willing him to say them. Rush is engagingly eccentric and believable as the voice therapist; incidentally, at that time it would have been almost unthinkable for a British-born therapist to take the liberties with protocol taken by Logue and the inspired casting of Rush makes the relationship entirely plausible.The supporting cast is stellar and equally skilful in creating their characters. Helena Bonham Carter is marvelous as Queen Elizabeth, known to later generations as the Queen Mother; she's suitably refined and genteel, but with the quirkiness and determination that the lady herself possessed. Guy Pearce is a weak and feckless Edward VIII (and looks just like him, too); Michael Gambon gives his usual fine performance as the tyrannous George V; Derek Jacobi and Jennifer Ehle play their parts admirably, and not least the wonderful Claire Bloom plays a convincingly uptight Queen Mary.

1365062,A9TG2NFA614S9,B003UESJH4,John F. Rooney,"[27, 31]","""The King's Speech"" is superior filmmaking and acting with impeccable performances by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush and with an outstanding contribution by Helena Bonham Carter. This is a deeply moving, deeply involving movie full of historical detail and the famous people of the thirties. I can't think of a recent movie that touched me like this one, and one that so satisfied me. The dramatic conflict between Firth and Rush is brilliantly done.The man who became George VI (1936-1952) was a stammerer who dreaded becoming the monarch. With the caring tutelage of Lionel Logue (Rush) he is able to control his stuttering for the crucial speech inaugurating Britain's entry into World War II. The strategy of Rush revealed him as a brilliant and imaginative teacher. He was an Australian, a speech therapist, uncertified, but a man had helped many veterans of the Great War in their speech problems.It is instructive to remember that Carter is playing the queen consort who was the mother of the present Queen of England, Elizabeth II. The Queen Mother (or Queen Mum) died in 2002 at the age of 101.In the movie the Prince of Wales (Guy Pearce) is not depicted favorably, nor was he a figure to admire in real life. He married a twice-divorced American woman with a shady reputation, was pro-Hitler, and was a man who sponged off others in his long useless life after abdicating as King Edward VIII in 1936. He was called David within the family and Albert (later George VI) was called Bertie. In his teaching Rush insisted that Albert allow him to call him Bertie to break the barrier between sovereign and subject and taskmaster and pupil. Bertie's' father, King George V, was a tyrant who had no patience for his stammering son. Logue had to dig into Bertie's's past to find how and why he became a stutterer.In one crucial scene, the nasty wastrel, David, now king, cruelly apes Bertie's affliction and accuses him of wanting the throne--something that Bertie feared and hoped to avoid. How could his subjects put up with a king who couldn't speak eloquently and fluently?Bertie and Lionel have epic arguments in the movie. As part of the therapy Lionel gets Bertie angry so he'll yell and not stutter. He also gets him to sing his thoughts. The scene in which Logue tells Bertie to say all the dirty words he knows is a hilarious moment in the film. Logue builds self-awareness and confidence into Bertie, and eventually a deep and lasting friendship develops. The final minutes of the film when the king is giving his radio speech to the nation under the direction of Logue are thrilling and poignant. He becomes his own man and inspires his countrymen in their darkest hour. This film deserves an Oscar.",5,Best Movie I've Seen in the Last Two Years,1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,2713,"['King', 'Speech', 'superior', 'filmmaking', 'acting', 'impeccable', 'performances', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'outstanding', 'contribution', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'deeply', 'moving', 'deeply', 'involving', 'movie', 'full', 'historical', 'detail', 'famous', 'people', 'thirties', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'recent', 'movie', 'touched', 'one', 'one', 'so', 'satisfied', 'dramatic', 'conflict', 'Firth', 'Rush', 'brilliantly', 'done.The', 'man', 'who', 'became', 'George', 'VI', '1936-1952', 'was', 'stammerer', 'who', 'dreaded', 'becoming', 'monarch', 'caring', 'tutelage', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'Rush', 'able', 'control', 'stuttering', 'crucial', 'speech', 'inaugurating', 'Britain', 'entry', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'strategy', 'Rush', 'revealed', 'brilliant', 'imaginative', 'teacher', 'was', 'Australian', 'speech', 'therapist', 'uncertified', 'man', 'had', 'helped', 'many', 'veterans', 'Great', 'War', 'speech', 'problems.It', 'instructive', 'remember', 'Carter', 'playing', 'queen', 'consort', 'who', 'was', 'mother', 'present', 'Queen', 'England', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'Queen', 'Mum', 'died', '2002', 'age', '101.In', 'movie', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'not', 'depicted', 'favorably', 'was', 'figure', 'admire', 'real', 'life', 'married', 'twice-divorced', 'American', 'woman', 'shady', 'reputation', 'was', 'pro-Hitler', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'sponged', 'off', 'others', 'long', 'useless', 'life', 'abdicating', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', '1936', 'was', 'called', 'David', 'family', 'Albert', 'later', 'George', 'VI', 'was', 'called', 'Bertie', 'teaching', 'Rush', 'insisted', 'Albert', 'allow', 'call', 'Bertie', 'break', 'barrier', 'sovereign', 'subject', 'taskmaster', 'pupil', 'Bertie', 'father', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'was', 'tyrant', 'who', 'had', 'patience', 'stammering', 'son', 'Logue', 'had', 'dig', ""Bertie's"", 'past', 'find', 'how', 'why', 'became', 'stutterer.In', 'one', 'crucial', 'scene', 'nasty', 'wastrel', 'David', 'now', 'king', 'cruelly', 'Bertie', 'affliction', 'wanting', 'throne', 'something', 'Bertie', 'feared', 'hoped', 'avoid', 'How', 'could', 'subjects', 'put', 'up', 'king', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'speak', 'eloquently', 'fluently', 'Bertie', 'Lionel', 'have', 'epic', 'arguments', 'movie', 'part', 'therapy', 'Lionel', 'Bertie', 'angry', 'so', ""'ll"", 'yell', 'not', 'stutter', 'also', 'sing', 'thoughts', 'scene', 'Logue', 'Bertie', 'say', 'dirty', 'words', 'hilarious', 'moment', 'film', 'Logue', 'self-awareness', 'confidence', 'Bertie', 'eventually', 'deep', 'lasting', 'friendship', 'final', 'minutes', 'film', 'when', 'king', 'giving', 'radio', 'speech', 'nation', 'direction', 'Logue', 'are', 'thrilling', 'poignant', 'own', 'man', 'countrymen', 'darkest', 'hour', 'film', 'Oscar']",N/A

Coincidently I'd just finished the book, The Reluctant King  (also reviewed). Quite an excellent book on the whole life of George VI & of interest to any Anglophile. In any case, this movie is quite the best I've seen in a decade. The Prince of York  (Colin Firth) second in line to a the British throne had a severe stutter. It did not become a major problem until it became obvious that because of his elder brother's personal problems he would succeed to king. The majority of the film is given over to his sessions with a an Australian therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). His manner with his royal majesty is decidedly informal as his insists on calling the now future king, Bertie & in turn being called Lionel. He feels this puts them on equal footing & he can talk to the king frankly. This just isn't done! But the king relents in the privacy of their sessions. Mr. Logue feels the stuttering is not a physical problem & probes into the kings private life & recollections of childhood. This intrusion by an outsider infuriates the king. Interestingly he does not stutter when he loses his temper or curses.That is used to humorous effect as Mr, Logue eggs on the king to the most vulgar expletives in the loudest voice possible. Helen Bonham Carter has a large role as is wonderful as the Queen consort Elizabeth. She is of course, the mother of the current Queen Elizabeth II. For all who appreciate good historical drama with a bit of humor. The acting all around is simply the best. Academy Awards? I'd say Mr. Firth & Ms Bonham Carter must be considered as best actor & actress, with Mr. Rush as supporting actor.

Wilson,"[2, 2]","""The King's Speech"" is a beautifully universal film about the expectations and obstacles that are passed down to us, and the means by which we can all manage to overcome them. With some terrific performances and superb work by director Tom Hopper, the film also garners some important and inspiring messages. It is rated-R for the use of one or two naughty words--an unfortunate truth. It is a wonderful film that is more than suitable for a wider age group than its rating permits.The film opens in 1925 as Prince Albert (Colin Firth,) son of King George V, is preparing to give a speech to thousands of eager listeners at Wembley Stadium in England. His dearly supportive wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) stands close by, gazing over at her husband, hoping for success. Alas, Albert's voice refuses to cooperate, and his stammering speech gets the best of him.Because Albert is in such a prominent sociopolitical position, he dreads the frequent speeches that he must give to his country through the radio. He hires many different speech therapists, all knighted and credentialed, but no techniques they offer can cure his stammer--not even a mouth full of marbles does the trick.His wife therefore decides to seek out a lesser-known speech therapist, and we finally meet Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush.) Logue is known largely for his relatively unorthodox methods, and when Elizabeth first meets him and asks him to help her husband, it is clear that he knows he is damn good at what he does.After his father dies, Albert's brother David (Guy Pierce) briefly takes over, but due to his plans to marry a divorced American woman, he quickly steps down and Albert inherits the throne as King George VI.So begins Albert's struggle to conquer his stammer with Logue's help. These are some of the most wonderfully written scenes I have seen in film, as Logue manages to peel away the layers and reveal the roots of Albert's stammer. As Humphrey Bogart once said, this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Through these scenes, we actually get to witness the birth and growth of a true friendship, one that is built on trust, courage and the need to overcome the challenge of being unable to speak publicly in a job that demands it.Firth has already won the Golden Globe for Best Actor for this performance, and he will no doubt win once again at the Oscars. It is a tremendous performance that resonates strongly with anyone who has ever felt insecure or had stage fright.  Being put on the spot is never a fun experience, especially when you are addressing a nation that is relying on you for guidance at the onset of WWII.Rush is equally brilliant in this film. He is an actor who can blend seamlessly into any roll he is asked to perform, from the Marquise de Sade to Peter Sellers, and Lionel Logue is a perfect fit. Rush's tone and delivery in every scene are marvelous. As Logue's confidence in his work and in Albert remains intact throughout the toughest of times, we see their relationship become deeper and more genuine each time they meet.Pierce is terrific as Albert's unreliable brother, and brings an authentic nuance to their relationship which suggests that he has forced his own insecurities upon Albert, as in one particular scene when he reminds his stammering brother of a cruel childhood taunt, calling him ""B-B-Bertie.""Gambon is also very good as a father who couldn't understand his son, and wouldn't try to.

That is the quality-level of The King's Speech.Rarely has there ever been a movie where every scene, every role, each word is nothing short of perfection.The acting by the leads is nothing short of masterful. Colin Firth has such control over the emotional roller coast ride that he brings the future king to life on multiple levels: you see George (""Bertie"") as both a human being afflicted with ghosts from a dysfunctional early life and a powerful force that is to be dealt with accordingly. Matching him is Geoffrey Rush as speech therapist Lionel Logue.  Mr. Rush, under the skillful hand of director Tom Hooper, underplays a part that is quite easy to overblow.  With patience, frustration, humanity and a steel rod spine of determination, he is both the devil and the angel sitting on the future King's shoulders. With a casual elegance that is part Noel Coward, part Laurence Olivier, Mr. Rush covers areas from therapy to slapstick with a calculated ease that is breath taking. Keeping up in the acting race is Helena Bonham Carter - a woman who has obvious talent but is prone, at times, to select roles that are more of an oddity rather than a challenge for her considerable skills.  Here, however, Ms. Carter flourishes in the role of the future Queen Mother. Her Elizabeth is both warm and determined. In her eyes you see the power that is capable of holding a nation together. Her Elizabeth is elegant but never stuffy - she obviously researched both the person she is portraying as well as the challenges that must have faced the real life Elizabeth.As good as the acting is with these three (and it is very, very good), The King's Speech is still an ensemble piece. No role (from Derek Jacobi's Archbishop down to the young Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret) is less than perfectly executed.The King's Speech, especially with the trouble brewing overseas today, is a timely reminder of the need for quality and leadership.",5,Magnificient,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,1991,"['Think', 'MASTERPIECE', 'THEATER', 'MERCHANT', 'IVORY', 'quality-level', 'King', 'Speech.Rarely', 'ever', 'been', 'movie', 'where', 'scene', 'role', 'word', 'nothing', 'short', 'perfection.The', 'acting', 'leads', 'nothing', 'short', 'masterful', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'such', 'control', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coast', 'ride', 'future', 'king', 'life', 'multiple', 'levels', 'see', 'George', 'Bertie', 'human', 'being', 'afflicted', 'ghosts', 'dysfunctional', 'early', 'life', 'powerful', 'force', 'be', 'dealt', 'accordingly', 'Matching', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'speech', 'therapist', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'Mr', 'Rush', 'skillful', 'hand', 'director', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'part', 'quite', 'easy', 'overblow', 'patience', 'frustration', 'humanity', 'steel', 'rod', 'spine', 'determination', 'devil', 'angel', 'sitting', 'future', 'King', 'shoulders', 'casual', 'elegance', 'part', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'part', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Mr', 'Rush', 'areas', 'therapy', 'slapstick', 'calculated', 'ease', 'breath', 'taking', 'Keeping', 'up', 'acting', 'race', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'woman', 'who', 'obvious', 'talent', 'prone', 'times', 'select', 'roles', 'are', 'more', 'oddity', 'rather', 'challenge', 'considerable', 'skills', 'Here', 'however', 'Ms.', 'Carter', 'flourishes', 'role', 'future', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'Elizabeth', 'warm', 'determined', 'eyes', 'see', 'power', 'capable', 'holding', 'nation', 'together', 'Elizabeth', 'elegant', 'never', 'stuffy', 'obviously', 'researched', 'person', 'portraying', 'as', 'well', 'challenges', 'must', 'have', 'faced', 'real', 'life', 'Elizabeth.As', 'good', 'acting', 'three', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'King', 'Speech', 'still', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'role', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Archbishop', 'down', 'young', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Princess', 'Margaret', 'less', 'perfectly', 'executed.The', 'King', 'Speech', 'especially', 'trouble', 'brewing', 'overseas', 'today', 'timely', 'reminder', 'need', 'quality', 'leadership']",N/A

1365071,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B003UESJH4,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 1]","The Prince Albert, Duke of York (Colin Firth), known as Bertie to his family, finds himself repeatedly made to address the nation with radio broadcasts becoming something of great importance. Since Bertie suffers from a rather severe stammer, this is problematic. With his father King George V (Michael Gambon) nearing death and his brother David (Guy Pearce) considering abandoning the throne in favor of marrying a twice-divorced woman, Bertie is under immense pressure to please the monarchy. Having tried several techniques and doctors to no avail, Bertie's wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) consults the unorthodox Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a failed Australian actor who believes he can cure Bertie of his stammer. While initially skeptical of Lionel, Bertie eventually comes around with the realization that Lionel may be the only person who can help him with this problem. Their dynamic friendship forms the backbone of the entire film.The King's Speech is one of the most acclaimed films of 2010 and has stolen the thunder once held by The Social Network, making it the favorite to win the Best Picture Academy Award. The film makes an interesting companion piece to The Social Network in that both films deal with new ways to reach people and the effect that those advances have on personal relationships. In some ways, the friendship between Bertie and Lionel is the perfect flipside for the friendship between Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield. While The Social Network more closely reflects personal relationships of today and is a closer representation of the attitude of today's society it's obvious why the Academy would favor a film like The King's Speech, which is an inspiring, crowd-pleasing film with a positive portrayal of friendship at the heart of it...And is a hard film not to like.This is very much a character-driven piece that is only as good as it's actors. Firth is a lock for Best Actor and is in rare form giving a convincing and charming performance that presents the daunting task of holding your interest and gaining your empathy while playing a character with a stammer. It takes a talented actor to not only make the stammer convincing, but not annoy the audience with it and still create a triumphant and fascinating character. Firth does all of this and will be a very deserving recipient of his award. When it comes to the Best Supporting Actor race; my heart wants John Hawkes, while my head says Christian Bale but I believe Rush has some serious stake in this race. Arguably, Rush gives the most likable performance of the five nominees and his character of Lionel Logue was probably not an Oscar-worthy role on the page. I'm sure that it is Rush's charming and likable performance that scored the nomination and not the pre-written role. The other nominee is Bonham Carter as Bertie's assertive, supportive wife. Bonham Carter is effective and she's a favorite to some, but I'd give the edge to Melissa Leo this year. All the bit roles are well-played and even Guy Pearce is good in his small role, although his casting is a mystery. Pearce is seven years younger than Firth and is noticeably younger, but is cast as Firth's older brother. It really is the dynamic and great screen chemistry between Firth and Rush that elevate this film however. The two play off each other terrifically, delivering some of the wittiest lines, all while displaying remarkable comedic timing even while one actor must do so with a stammer. I'd like to see these two work together again and while Firth will definitely be seen accepting his gold statute, I will be pleased to see Rush up there as well.Unlike most historical films, cinematographer Danny Cohen hasn't shot a sprawling epic that allows the audience to take in every historical re-creation. The King's Speech differs significantly from this historical film template by shooting the majority of the film inside with tight shots that create the illusion of everything towering over or closing in on Bertie. The cinematography here is absolutely elegant, while the score by Alexandre Desplat is a sweeping, Oscar-baiting score that serves to heighten and intensify the film's most dramatic scenes and does so admirably.The man overcoming personal obstacles to achieve greatness is such a familiar storytelling clich&eacute;, but one that frequently succeeds at connecting with an audience. Yes, The King's Speech is based on a true story but that doesn't mean it's wholly original. It's a crowd-pleasing, historical film that is funny, charming, and accessible with themes that everyone can relate to and it happens to be very well-made and well-told.  Frankly The King's Speech is predictable, Oscar-baiting fare and a first-rate crowd-pleaser. However familiar its story may be, I can't find a cinematic misstep though. It really is very well-made. Don't let my complaints about Hollywood politics overrating this film dissuade you from thinking it's not a great film. For all the familiarity, it is a great film but it's not a film that will be discussed years from now. I have found it difficult to resist the film's charm however and I admit that there are actors here doing career-best work and it's an uplifting film that's guaranteed to put a smile on your face.The film is inexplicably rated `R' for `some language,' which actually means `a scene of sustained strong language.' In the film, Lionel discovers that Bertie doesn't stammer when he swears and he incorporates this into the sessions. The MPAA has a policy that the `f' word can only be used up to three times in a non-sexual context to get a PG-13 rating. The fact that it's used in a non-sexual, historical context and is a film that may actually be accessible to a younger audience who can't see `R' rated films seems to not influence their decisions. This is a very unfortunate rating and is yet another reason why the MPAA needs to be reformed.GRADE: A-",5,"A Well-Made, Marvelously Acted Familiar Story",1297641600,"02 14,

1365085,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B003UESJH4,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[1, 1]","""The Kings Speech"" follows the ascension of Prince Albert Windsor (Colin Firth) to King George VI and his simultaneous struggles with stuttering and how he overcame this problem through the help of speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush).Bertie, as he was known by his family and Logue addresses him as such through most of the movie shouldn't have been king, and wasn't expected to be king because of he was third in the line of succession after his father, George V (Michael Gambon). After his father's death his brother David (Guy Pearce) became King Edward VIII and then abdicated because he wanted to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson (Eve Best).If anyone believes the royal family has an easy life, the story of Bertie's childhood will put that to rest. As Logue explores the cause of Bertie's stutter some revelations come to light. Raised primarily by nannies, Bertie had limited contact with his parents as a child and that was at arranged ""visitations."" We learn that Bertie's first nanny didn't like him so she would pinch him so he would cry at the visitations and his parents would quickly return him to the nanny's care and she wouldn't feed him. His father was also domineering and because of David's hedonistic lifestyle expected a lot more from Bertie, and having to address your father, literally as ""your royal highness"" is a good way to intimidate a child. Bertie's major strength in life was his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), not only supportive of Bertie but was the one who finds Logue to help.I don't think I`ve revealed too much of the plot. Hopefully enough to whet your appetite. The strength of the movie lies not in the plot, but in the acting and that's what holds the movie together, the strength of the performances. ""The King's Speech"" also defies expectations on certain counts, such as a scene that could have been safely a clich&eacute; where you think it will be demonstrated to Bertie that he can speak without stuttering defies the clich&eacute; and Bertie discovers on his own that through Logue's help he can speak without stuttering. You could attribute that to just following the chronology of history, but throughout the movie scenes that you think you know how they will play out, defy those expectations and give you a much more interesting movie. There's a little something for everyone, a little comedy, mostly related to smoking as a healthy activity, and what do you call a royal when they drop in on your house. Drama as Bertie struggles with his problem and struggles with Logue, and the mounting expectations put on him as it becomes clear that Edward will have to abdicate.The Queen Mother, Elizabeth (the mother of the present Queen Elizabeth), didn't want the movie made of this until after her death, it makes one wonder why? She is presented as nothing but supportive of Bertie. The worst it presents her husband as a an unwilling king, but they all seemed to be unwilling to assume the mantle of the crown. Otherwise Bertie is shown more as victim of low self-esteem. Was she worried the royal family would be perceived as human?Special features include a directors commentary, a making of documentary, and an interview with Lionel Lougue's grandson.",5,The Man Who Didn't Want To Be King,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,3229,"['Kings', 'Speech', 'ascension', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'Windsor', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'simultaneous', 'struggles', 'stuttering', 'how', 'problem', 'help', 'speech', 'therapist', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', '.Bertie', 'was', 'known', 'family', 'Logue', 'such', 'most', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'king', 'was', ""n't"", 'expected', 'be', 'king', 'was', 'third', 'line', 'succession', 'father', 'George', 'V', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'father', 'death', 'brother', 'David', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'became', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'then', 'abdicated', 'wanted', 'marry', 'American', 'divorcee', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'Eve', 'Best', '.If', 'anyone', 'royal', 'family', 'easy', 'life', 'story', 'Bertie', 'childhood', 'will', 'put', 'rest', 'Logue', 'cause', 'Bertie', 'stutter', 'revelations', 'come', 'light', 'Raised', 'primarily', 'nannies', 'Bertie', 'had', 'limited', 'contact', 'parents', 'child', 'was', 'arranged', 'visitations', 'learn', 'Bertie', 'first', 'nanny', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'so', 'would', 'pinch', 'so', 'would', 'cry', 'visitations', 'parents', 'would', 'quickly', 'return', 'nanny', 'care', 'would', ""n't"", 'feed', 'father', 'was', 'also', 'domineering', 'David', 'hedonistic', 'lifestyle', 'expected', 'lot', 'more', 'Bertie', 'having', 'address', 'father', 'literally', 'royal', 'highness', 'good', 'way', 'intimidate', 'child', 'Bertie', 'major', 'strength', 'life', 'was', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'not', 'only', 'supportive', 'Bertie', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'Logue', 'help.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 've', 'revealed', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'Hopefully', 'enough', 'whet', 'appetite', 'strength', 'movie', 'not', 'plot', 'acting', 'what', 'movie', 'together', 'strength', 'performances', 'King', 'Speech', 'also', 'expectations', 'certain', 'counts', 'such', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'safely', 'clich', 'eacute', 'where', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'demonstrated', 'Bertie', 'can', 'speak', 'stuttering', 'defies', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Bertie', 'discovers', 'own', 'Logue', 'help', 'can', 'speak', 'stuttering', 'could', 'attribute', 'just', 'following', 'chronology', 'history', 'movie', 'think', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'defy', 'expectations', 'give', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'movie', 'little', 'something', 'everyone', 'little', 'comedy', 'mostly', 'related', 'smoking', 'healthy', 'activity', 'what', 'do', 'call', 'royal', 'when', 'drop', 'house', 'Drama', 'Bertie', 'problem', 'struggles', 'Logue', 'mounting', 'expectations', 'put', 'clear', 'Edward', 'will', 'have', 'abdicate.The', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'Elizabeth', 'mother', 'present', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'movie', 'made', 'death', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'presented', 'nothing', 'supportive', 'Bertie', 'worst', 'husband', 'unwilling', 'king', 'seemed', 'be', 'unwilling', 'assume', 'mantle', 'crown', 'Otherwise', 'Bertie', 'shown', 'more', 'victim', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'Was', 'worried', 'royal', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'perceived', 'human', 'Special', 'features', 'include', 'directors', 'commentary', 'making', 'documentary', 'interview', 'Lionel', 'Lougue', 'grandson']",N/A

It is the story of a man who must overcome a debilitating condition.  It is also a story of an unbreakable friendship and belief in yourself.  THE KING'S SPEECH is my choice for Best Picture of the Year.Prince Albert was never supposed to become the king of England.  He was content being a naval officer and a husband.  But when his father, King George V, died and his flamboyant brother, King Edward, scandalously abdicated to marry American divorcee Wallace Simpson, ""Bertie,"" as he was known to his family, suddenly found himself thrust on the throne and into the lime light... just when England was on the brink of war and needed a strong king the most.  You see, Bertie had an almost incapacitating stutter; he could barely make himself understood, especially during public speeches.  But his loving wife, Queen Elizabeth (who became the Queen Mother), never gave up hope or her belief in her husband, and eventually introduced him to Lionel Logue, an out of work Australian actor who had some unconventional, yet successful, methods that helped many people overcome their stutters.  Along the way, a very extraordinary friendship is formed, hardships are overcome, and a true king is made.THE KING'S SPEECH is a remarkable film, full of warmth, sentiment, and heart.  Then entire cast is outstanding, most especially Colin Firth as King George VI, Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue, Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth, and Michael Gambon as King George V.  This entire ensemble deserves the highest accolades, including Timothy Spall in a cameo as Winston Churchill.  The chemistry is wonderful, the atmosphere is real and believable, the cinematography is era-perfect, and the story is heartbreaking and uplifting all at the same time.  You will laugh, cry, and care; and these are the things the best films should do.I really didn't know what to expect when I saw THE KING'S SPEECH, but I am so very glad my husband talked me into it.

The royal life is always fascinating and of course the time frame, pre-WWII was of interest, so I finally took the plunge and rented a copy. I knew it was about a stuttering monarch and had read just enough to know that he used some inventive tools to overcome his situation when required to speak publicly.I didn't expect the movie to be so charmingly quirky though. And quirk is a hot button for me so I ended up loving this flick. Firth as Bertie is spot on. His frustrations, his heart, his sensitivity show throughout the span of the movie. The film begins with Firth's Prince Albert Bertie filling in for his father, the king. And the distress at stuttering his way through the simple announcement is all over his face, and throughout the listening audience as the camera pans over them. Humiliated and frustrated he seeks help and finds more frustration and humiliation. Until his wife finds Logue, Geoffrey Rush, a ""doctor"" with a flair for the dramatic. The two men begin to form a friendship and it's a beautiful thing to behold. Bertie's story was heart-breaking but his heart for the people and his family and his drive to overcome this challenge were inspiring.Geoffrey Rush is a delight to watch, and is perfectly cast as well. The cinematography and editing are well done. Overall, the only thing that could be offputting for family viewing is two bursts of language. Bertie doesn't stutter when cussing. This becomes an exercise.

Europe had survived the worst war with more casualties than the sum total of all previous wars up to that time.  Nobody was paying attention to Hitler, and in fact people in the British government thought he was a good guy in the beginning.  Then he started trying to take over the world.  The first person in line to succeed the King of England wanted to marry a three-timing American divorcee from Baltimore.  Would barely cause a stir these days, but back then it was a scandalous head turner, and the Church of England (of which the King of England is the head) was having none of it.  The Duke of York, Albert - the second in line of succession to the throne - stuttered.  And the ""wireless"" microphone and radio was on the upsurge.  Great Britain was the most powerful country in the world at that time.Capturing the epic drama on film and still preserving the personal drama was the biggest bio-pic achievement since ""Gandhi.""  Saying this was well acted is the understatement of the year.  Without going on for eight paragraphs repeating what has already been said in other fine reviews, what is portrayed in the King's Speech is loyalty, friendship, and compassion beyond measure.  That alone would set this film apart from most of what was released last year.  I never understood England's fixation on the Queen Mother (Queen Elizabeth, portrayed beautifully by Helena Bonham Carter) until I saw this film.  Colin Firth turns in a finely nuanced performance, but it is the chemistry between him and Geoffrey Rush that make the film as successful as it is.  What makes the screenplay so good isn't just the fine writing, but the fact they discovered Lionel Logue's diary, letter between the real George VI and Logue, and a copy of the actual marked up speech that was used by the king at the climax of the film and incorporated all of that into the script.  They didn't just get it ""kind of right""  They nailed it.If you like bio-pics, good history, or inspirational films, highly recommend.  The King's Speech is a result of impeccable craftsmanship and years of perseverance winning out over commercialism. And Lord knows, we can use all the inspiration we can get.  I can't wait to see what Tom Hooper is going to serve up next.On Blu-ray the film is pristine sharp, and clear.  The cinematography and picture composition really shine.  Plenty of extras.  A good commentary track, and a 'making of documentary,' and a fun question and answer session with the cast.  One of the better transfers I've seen on this medium.

Being a stutterer could be the hardest thing one could face in his entire life. That is because we humans naturally need to communicate with one another, and talking is a basic communication method that is used on a daily basis. Now when your basic need for communication becomes your worst fear due to you being a stutterer, you become your own worst enemy.This movie highlighted some of the common conclusions and theories about the causes and treatment of stuttering:- You are not born a stutterer, something caused it- When you speak to yourself, you don't stutter- When you can't hear your voice, you don't stutter- Taking a deep breath before speaking makes speaking easier- You don't stutter when you sing (and thus speak with a melodic accent to help avoid stuttering)- Most parents do not know how to fix their child's stuttering problem. They usually unknowingly make it worse- When you get a hesitation while speaking, turn it into a pause then continue- If pronouncing a letter is difficult, skip over it (e.g. if pronouncing ""P"" is difficult, put an ""A"" before the ""P"" and say the word)- Frequent pauses makes speaking much easierI always thought that planning the speech or thinking about the pronunciation of the word before saying it is what causes you to stutter. I always thought that speaking happens naturally without thinking and if you start thinking about speaking, you lose control and that's because putting the letters together to form words and sentences is very complicated that has to be done spontaneously.Great Movie!Oscar Award is well deserved!!",5,Great Film!!,1301529600,"03 31, 2011",2011,1633,"['Great', 'movie', 'difficulty', 'being', 'stutterer', 'Being', 'stutterer', 'could', 'be', 'hardest', 'thing', 'one', 'could', 'face', 'entire', 'life', 'humans', 'naturally', 'need', 'communicate', 'one', 'talking', 'basic', 'communication', 'method', 'used', 'daily', 'basis', 'Now', 'when', 'basic', 'need', 'communication', 'becomes', 'worst', 'fear', 'due', 'being', 'stutterer', 'become', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy.This', 'movie', 'highlighted', 'common', 'conclusions', 'theories', 'causes', 'treatment', 'stuttering', 'are', 'not', 'born', 'stutterer', 'something', 'caused', 'it-', 'When', 'speak', 'do', ""n't"", 'stutter-', 'When', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'voice', 'do', ""n't"", 'stutter-', 'Taking', 'deep', 'breath', 'speaking', 'speaking', 'easier-', 'do', ""n't"", 'stutter', 'when', 'sing', 'thus', 'speak', 'melodic', 'accent', 'help', 'avoid', 'stuttering', 'Most', 'parents', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'fix', 'child', 'stuttering', 'problem', 'usually', 'unknowingly', 'make', 'worse-', 'When', 'get', 'hesitation', 'speaking', 'turn', 'pause', 'then', 'continue-', 'pronouncing', 'letter', 'difficult', 'e.g', 'pronouncing', 'P', 'difficult', 'put', 'A', 'P', 'say', 'word', 'Frequent', 'pauses', 'speaking', 'much', 'easierI', 'always', 'thought', 'planning', 'speech', 'thinking', 'pronunciation', 'word', 'saying', 'what', 'stutter', 'always', 'thought', 'speaking', 'happens', 'naturally', 'thinking', 'start', 'thinking', 'speaking', 'lose', 'control', 'putting', 'letters', 'together', 'form', 'words', 'sentences', 'very', 'complicated', 'be', 'done', 'spontaneously.Great', 'Movie', 'Oscar', 'Award', 'well', 'deserved']",N/A
1365101,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003UESJH4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[114, 128]","Earlier this year when I started hearing raves about ""The King's Speech"" on the film festival circuit, I knew it was a film for me.  I have eagerly awaited its arrival for many months and, as expected, it is a dignified and well scripted effort.  Intelligent, adult entertainment of this sort only hits the theaters around awards time and there is no denying that ""The King's Speech"" is positioning itself perfectly for the year's biggest competition.  In an unusual bit of bravado, David Seidler's screenplay is fashioned as a feel good underdog story.  Yes, that's right--King George VI is a plucky survivor who must overcome adversity to win the respect of his family and his nation.  It's an unusual tactic, really, but I think that's why so many people are responding to ""The King's Speech"" in a more personal way than past stories of regal history.  The film humanizes this world leader in a very identifiable way.The plotting of ""The King's Speech"" is pretty straightforward and most people will know the principle story through either history or the film's advertising.  Colin Firth plays King George VI who battled with a bad stutter for most of his life.  Trying to stay out of the spotlight, Firth has never worried about ascending to the throne as he has an older brother (Guy Pearce) who is in line for that distinction.  However, Pearce ends up being more concerned with an inappropriate romance than with ruling a nation.  Firth's wife (Helena Bonham Carter), meanwhile, has contracted an unusual speech therapist (Geoffrey Rush) that breaks all the rules.  Insisting on equality with the future King, Rush and Firth form a tentative friendship.  But as Firth takes his place in the monarchy just as World War II is imminent, he must unite the nation with his inaugural radio speech.  Guess how it goes?Obviously, you can't beat the cast of ""The King's Speech.""  Bonham Carter is a delight--both haughty and approachable.  Rush is as solid as always and Firth is terrific.  Truth be told, I personally would have given Firth last year's Oscar for ""A Single Man"" and Bonham Carter deserved it for ""The Wings of the Dove"" many years ago.  They will, undoubtedly, both be in the running again this year as will Rush.  Despite Rush's classification in the supporting actor category, however, don't be fooled.  It is clearly a lead role!  Guy Pearce is particularly amusing as an elder brother as he is about seven years younger than Firth.  And I like seeing Derek Jacobi as an archbishop (amusing because Jacobi also played a famous historical stammerer in the glorious mini-series ""I, Claudius"").All in all, ""The King's Speech"" is both witty and touching.  It's a well made and literate film, one that I admired a lot.  It did, however, play out exactly as you might expect with little narrative surprise.  But that's a small point that is definitely overshadowed by the many great attributes present in the film.

1365104,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B003UESJH4,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[1, 1]","Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter turn in virtually flawless performances in this virtually flawless film which has a shot at making the Top 100 of All Time.Firth plays King George VI, nee the Duke of York, familiarly known as ""Bertie"" to his family, who reigned over the Great British Empire from 1937 to 1951. As the second son of King George V and Queen Mary (she for whom the ocean liner was named), Bertie was ""the reluctant King,"" who came to the throne after his brother David (King Edward VIII, nee the Prince of Wales, subsequently the Duke of Windsor) abdicated the British throne to marry ""the woman he loved"" the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson with whom he had been carrying on a dalliance for years. Mrs. Simpson continued affairs even while she dated the King, most infamously with Joachim Von Ribbentrop, one of Hitler's intimates, who sent her a fresh bouquet daily for years.King Edward VIII was a clubman, a gambler, a womanizer and a moral and intellectual lightweight who was remarkable for his vacuous conversation, his patronizing racial and religious attitudes, and his opinion of Hitler as ""not such a bad chap."" In short, he was the wrong King at the wrong time, that being the prewar 1930s. With the world mired in Depression and being ruled by racialist dictators, it is an open question how he, as moral leader of Britain, would have responded to World War II. History tells us that the imperious and remote George V wanted Bertie to ascend the throne in lieu of David in any case.Bertie, who was ""prone to tears"" as a sensitive child, was raised at a distance from his parents (quite common in those generations), was a left-hander forced to be a ""rightie,"" was put into uncomfortable braces for being ""knock-kneed,"" was subjected to ongoing physical and emotional neglect by his Governesses, and was teased by his siblings and peers for his stammer, which worsened as the years progressed. His father, unkind though well-meaning, berated him for his speech impediment and forced him to speak publicly, a humiliating experience.In 1926 Bertie made the acquaintance of Lionel Logue, an unorthodox speech therapist who helped George VI become a great public speaker. Logue also became a close friend for the rest of the King's life, and aided him in making most of his public addresses.Most of THE KING'S SPEECH focuses on Bertie's unexpected ascension of the throne and his duty to lead the British Empire in time of war using his words alone. In many ways George VI was unlucky; though media was coming into its own, in his reign particularly every speech was live, with recording and editing techniques that were exceptionally primitive. Given the era, a stuttering King would have been seen by most of his billion subjects as weak. And George VI faced a crisis in World War II that no British monarch has faced before or since. Thus, Logue's task was a herculean one.Rush plays the Australian Logue brilliantly, eschewing a ""Crocodile Dundee"" accent for a caustic irreverence. Though this sometimes enrages the King, Logue speaks to him man to man not man to monarch, gaining his trust. He becomes the King's true brother. Their relationship, serious and comic by turns, makes this a ""Buddy Film"" nonpareil.Firth is spectacular as the King. He never misses a beat, despite the difficulty of invoking a stutter where one is not present. He also shows us a kind, gentle, occasionally truculent, and altogether human King George VI, a man deeply in love with his wife and daughters (one the present Queen, Elizabeth II), dedicated to his nation, pained by his brother's lack of responsibility, agonizing over assuming a role he never wanted, and terrified of failing his subjects.Helena Bonham Carter plays Queen Consort Elizabeth (the Queen Mother) as a warm iron hand in a velvet glove. Elizabeth has no pretensions at all; she simply loves her family, and embodies the old adage that ""Behind Every Great Man There Stands a Woman,"" never failing to support and wisely counsel her husband, even when she takes him to task at one point for being unduly rude to Logue. ""You apologize,"" she calmly advises, when he asks her what to do. She dries his tears. She stands by her man in the best way imaginable. Of everyone he knows, only she intimately feels the loneliness he knows in being the King-Emperor.This is a film well worth seeing, and seeing many times, with the kind of depth that ensures its status as a true classic.",5,The Best Picture In Many A Year,1304640000,"05 6, 2011",2011,4470,"['Colin', 'Firth', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'turn', 'virtually', 'flawless', 'performances', 'virtually', 'flawless', 'film', 'shot', 'making', 'Top', '100', 'All', 'Time.Firth', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'Duke', 'York', 'familiarly', 'known', 'Bertie', 'family', 'who', 'reigned', 'Great', 'British', 'Empire', '1937', '1951', 'second', 'son', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'whom', 'ocean', 'liner', 'was', 'named', 'Bertie', 'was', 'reluctant', 'King', 'who', 'came', 'throne', 'brother', 'David', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'subsequently', 'Duke', 'Windsor', 'abdicated', 'British', 'throne', 'marry', 'woman', 'loved', 'twice-divorced', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'whom', 'had', 'been', 'carrying', 'dalliance', 'years', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson', 'continued', 'affairs', 'even', 'dated', 'King', 'most', 'infamously', 'Joachim', 'Von', 'Ribbentrop', 'one', 'Hitler', 'intimates', 'who', 'sent', 'fresh', 'bouquet', 'daily', 'years.King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'was', 'clubman', 'gambler', 'womanizer', 'moral', 'intellectual', 'lightweight', 'who', 'was', 'remarkable', 'vacuous', 'conversation', 'patronizing', 'racial', 'religious', 'attitudes', 'opinion', 'Hitler', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'chap', 'short', 'was', 'wrong', 'King', 'wrong', 'time', 'being', 'prewar', '1930s', 'world', 'mired', 'Depression', 'being', 'ruled', 'racialist', 'dictators', 'open', 'question', 'how', 'moral', 'leader', 'Britain', 'would', 'have', 'responded', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'History', 'imperious', 'remote', 'George', 'V', 'wanted', 'Bertie', 'ascend', 'throne', 'lieu', 'David', 'case.Bertie', 'who', 'was', 'prone', 'tears', 'sensitive', 'child', 'was', 'raised', 'distance', 'parents', 'quite', 'common', 'generations', 'was', 'left-hander', 'forced', 'be', 'rightie', 'was', 'put', 'uncomfortable', 'braces', 'being', 'knock-kneed', 'was', 'subjected', 'ongoing', 'physical', 'emotional', 'neglect', 'Governesses', 'was', 'teased', 'siblings', 'peers', 'stammer', 'worsened', 'years', 'progressed', 'father', 'unkind', 'well-meaning', 'berated', 'speech', 'impediment', 'forced', 'speak', 'publicly', 'humiliating', 'experience.In', '1926', 'Bertie', 'made', 'acquaintance', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'unorthodox', 'speech', 'therapist', 'who', 'helped', 'George', 'VI', 'become', 'great', 'public', 'speaker', 'Logue', 'also', 'became', 'close', 'friend', 'rest', 'King', 'life', 'aided', 'making', 'most', 'public', 'addresses.Most', 'THE', 'KING', 'SPEECH', 'Bertie', 'unexpected', 'ascension', 'throne', 'duty', 'lead', 'British', 'Empire', 'time', 'war', 'using', 'words', 'alone', 'many', 'ways', 'George', 'VI', 'was', 'unlucky', 'media', 'was', 'coming', 'own', 'reign', 'particularly', 'speech', 'was', 'live', 'recording', 'editing', 'techniques', 'were', 'exceptionally', 'primitive', 'Given', 'era', 'stuttering', 'King', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'most', 'billion', 'subjects', 'weak', 'George', 'VI', 'faced', 'crisis', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'British', 'monarch', 'faced', 'Thus', 'Logue', 'task', 'was', 'herculean', 'one.Rush', 'Australian', 'Logue', 'brilliantly', 'eschewing', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'accent', 'caustic', 'irreverence', 'King', 'Logue', 'man', 'man', 'not', 'man', 'monarch', 'gaining', 'trust', 'King', 'true', 'brother', 'relationship', 'serious', 'comic', 'turns', 'Buddy', 'Film', 'nonpareil.Firth', 'spectacular', 'King', 'never', 'beat', 'difficulty', 'invoking', 'stutter', 'where', 'one', 'not', 'present', 'also', 'kind', 'gentle', 'occasionally', 'truculent', 'altogether', 'human', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'man', 'deeply', 'love', 'wife', 'daughters', 'one', 'present', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'dedicated', 'nation', 'pained', 'brother', 'lack', 'responsibility', 'agonizing', 'over', 'assuming', 'role', 'never', 'wanted', 'terrified', 'failing', 'subjects.Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Queen', 'Consort', 'Elizabeth', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'warm', 'iron', 'hand', 'velvet', 'glove', 'Elizabeth', 'pretensions', 'simply', 'family', 'old', 'adage', 'Every', 'Great', 'Man', 'Woman', 'never', 'failing', 'support', 'wisely', 'counsel', 'husband', 'even', 'when', 'task', 'one', 'point', 'being', 'unduly', 'rude', 'Logue', 'apologize', 'advises', 'when', 'what', 'do', 'tears', 'man', 'best', 'way', 'imaginable', 'everyone', 'only', 'intimately', 'loneliness', 'being', 'King-Emperor.This', 'film', 'well', 'seeing', 'seeing', 'many', 'times', 'kind', 'depth', 'status', 'true', 'classic']",N/A

But I have to say, this movie is truly that great. The cinematography, casting, script, and everything else about this movie comes together in a perfect way.You couldn't ask for a better cast. Their acting is superb, and the way they all fit their characters and interact with each other is seamless. The script is well written and every bit of it has a purpose in the story. It is inspiring, powerful, emotional, and so much more!Now for the cinematography. I never thought a drama could have this kind of cinematography. It seems like action movies and sci-fi/fantasy movies get most of the nods in that category. Don't get me wrong, those genres can be amazing in the field (namely in The Lord of the Rings movies), but I would not expect this level of cinematography from a drama/period piece. A few of the film shots were some of the best I have ever seen in any movie.One of my concerns about this movie before seeing it was that it might be boring. It wasn't at all! I suppose some people might find it boring, and that is fine. It just might not be their cup of tea. But I found it to be very engaging. Colin Firth does such an amazing job as the lead. When he would struggle to speak, I could physically feel his anguish. His acting was so brilliant that even if he were the only good thing about the movie, it would still be worth watching. Fortunately, he is not the only good thing about it. Everything about it is good!I highly recommend watching this movie if you even remotely enjoy this genre.

I, however, was surprised it got not only Best Picture but also Best Director at the Oscars.  It's really just an everyday ""Masterpiece Theatre"" rendition of the story with a lot of ""F"" words thrown in.I mean, the story is very inspiring in the best Hollywood fashion.  A flawed man overcomes everything to wind up a great leader of his people during a time of war.  And Colin Firth's embodiment of George VI is remarkable...even more so when you actually can believe he is younger than Guy Peirce, who is seven years Firth's junior and looks even younger than that.  And Helena Bohnam Carter's portrayal of his chirpy, supportive wife is just as excellent...albeit not as flashy.  They both did right by David Seidler's fine script.My main problem stems from Hooper's direction.  It's very pedestrian.  I cannot think of one scene where he added anything more to the flow of the story than just pointing the camera.  Seriously, the man does not know how to form a quiet scene in a dramatic fashion but instead opts for camera set-ups that are disconcerting, at best.  For example, when Lionel and Bertie are talking in the teacher's parlor, they wind up being jammed against frame right or frame left and not looking at each other except in the vaguest of senses.  It's pretty telling that, at a time when I should be engrossed in the story, I'm jolted by things like that.It's not a bad movie.

1365110,A2DMY783TWSMC8,B003UESJH4,"Kyuzo ""Joe""","[1, 1]","Going into King's Speech, I was expecting one of two things. Either it would be a ridiculously boring film about snooty royalty giving speeches and doing snooty royalty stuff, or, as I had heard from many others who had seen it, it could be an emotional personal piece that everyone can relate to and enjoy. It ended up being the latter of course, and this worked both to its advantage and disadvantage.The cinematography was beautiful (if not a little to ""showey""), the characters were relatable, and the acting was superb. Rush is the shining star of all this, as it is he who the audience connects most with and it is he who is the most fun to watch.Saying all that, the mass appeal of the film does make it hard to enjoy at times. Too many scenes showed the king stuttering as either the characters we are meant to like look down in pain or the characters we are meant to hate smirk. At the same time, there is very little moral ambiguity to any of the main characters. Rush hates cigarets, cause their bad. The king and all his allies hate the nazi's, because they are bad. Making fun of stuttering is bad. Stuttering is sad. I'm not saying I disagree with these things, just that I can easily see the film makers hands at work when they use these conventions to get the audience behind or against certain characters. At the same time, this film is based on history, so I expect there to be bad sides to all the real life characters (No, I don't consider the five seconds of kingly snottiness to be a bad side). Finally, there are more then a few ""cutesy"" moments that got on my nerves.

On one level, it's a movie with a small scope - just three people feature in 80% of it - Colin Firth as the future King, Helena Bonham Carter as his wife, and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel his speech therapist. Of course these are three actors that can pull off that kind of focus, and they do. They are all riveting. And the movie is of course set right in the crux of history, on the cusp England going to war, so as it moves on, it does take on certain epic traits. In the end, though, I think it's more than anything a very personal story of the relationship between two men, and then how that relationship does ultimately impact history.

All the raves are well deserved and completely justified. It is an extremely well done film. Writing, directing, acting, all excellent. Colin Firth gives a many and varied dimension in his portrayal of King George VI, the reluctant King. Based on a true story, which was revealed after the King's death, it narrates the tremendous speech impediment which threatened his ascension to the throne after his brother, Edward VIII, abdicated. The relationship between ""Bertie"" (George VI) and Lionel Logue, a former actor who is determined to cure him, is fascinating in its simplicity and mutual friendship. Logue dares to treat Bertie as a human being and equal, although giving deference to his royal heritage, which defines the support and confidence that Bertie needs to achieve victory. The viewer can understand what has caused the impediment, viewing Bertie's relationship with his father and mother, George V and Queen Mary. Tremendous. The ambiance of the historical era of Hitler's ascent to power and the uncertainty and fear underscores Bertie's shaken confidence in his ability to ""do the job"" is all the more worthwhile as he is able to finally give the speech to his people at the onset of war between Germany and England. One rejoices at his victory, in which he finally also realizes that he does indeed possess the the qualities and confidence, which will give him the rightful place in history.

I'm writing about the wife of the king. (This before I checked the names of all the cast on the cover).  Something about her reminded me of other films I'd seen her in before, but I wasn't sure because whe looked and sounded so totally different.  The same thing happened when I saw her in Harry Potter playing the evil witch, Bellatrix Lestrang. Again, something familiar about her. So, I checked to make sure it was the same wonderful actress I saw in Howard's End, Helen Schlegel.  It was. And now the the king's wife, yet another entirely different role. The wife of ""Bertie"", the King. I'm writing of course of Helena Bonham Carter.  In each film she looked and sounded entirely different.  What a great actress she is!  This, so different from so many Hollywood actresses who keep playing the same type role in every film.  (This doesn't apply, of course, to Meryl Streep who can play any role in any film and play it perfectly.) Examples of a few recent ones:  Julie and Julia: playing Julia Childs, a happy go lucky incredible chef with a great sense of humor,  Doubt, playing Sister Aloysius Beauvier, an overly suspicious nun, and The Devil Wears Prada, whose head of a famous fashion magazine, considered by some movie reviewers to be the greatest living film actress in that particular film. Can they all be the same person?  Can that nun, that chef and that fashion editor and the many other roles she's played all be the same actress.Well, anyway, back to The King's Speech.  A perfect film.  I'm so glad I watched it.  I'd seen a bit of it before with a friend who had just rented it and was playing it at my house for a short time, but I saw so little, I couldn't possibly have gotten more than a tiny taste of it.  Then after buying the film, and watching the whole thing, I was stunned.  It absolutely was a great movie, a fascinating story, inspiring, and everyone in the cast was perfect.

As the Oscars rightly proved in 2011, they are all about handing out awards these days to puerile attempts at historical drama, with particular attention paid to films that attempt to dumb down British history.""The King's Speech"", a C-grade production that reduces historical fact to mere background, is yet another feather in Anglo-American productions that attempt to discredit what real movie-making is all about. However, this is all done so beautifully that many seasoned reviewers have called this an 'epic' or 'masterpiece', which is undoubtedly not the case.The primary issue lies with the convenient assumption that the British monarchy at the time were clean-cut individuals who were all about self development & attention to the nations requirements (it of course, says nothing about Chamberlain & Churchill's involvement with the Nazi Party). That being bad enough, it attempts to project Colin Firth, already a wishy-washy actor if there ever was one, in a role that is shamefully overplayed and terribly scripted. This is most telling when the best reception Firth gets is when he is uttering one word expletives during a training session with his vocal coach, played by Geoffrey Rush (in a play by numbers that is mind-numbingly toe-curling, for all the wrong reasons). Rush can sleepwalk through roles like these, as he plays much of the film as a passive observer of the royal affairs and is reduced to farce by the films' almost comical climax.The casting of Helena Bonham Carter as Prince Alberts' wife is also most befuddling, as it appears she has been in more period pieces than any other contemporary actress around; and in all of them she looks and sounds the same. The only time Carter has been outside of her comfort zone was in that incredible Tim Burton production with Ewan McGregor, but here it is business as usual, as she proceeds to carry herself with a faux-monarch air from one pointless frame to the next. I also found her presence most distracting, as she is the most unnatural of actors, in general. Consider the scene where she visits the house of Rush for the first time alongwith her husband, and while her acting here calls for restraint, she comes across as pompous and immensely unlikeable. I suppose its some relief that Carter didn't pick up any accolades for her performance here, because honestly, we have all witnessed it a thousand times before.Firth on the other hand, has to contend himself with vacuous one-liners that seem curiously targeted towards `the masses', as if things on screen need to be repeated or stated when not even required. What could be conveyed through expression or a glance, is always verbally stated here instead, lending the film a very `History Film for Dummies' feel, which is especially disconcerting. The best performance, if one can call it that, comes from Guy Pierce, who is normally terrific in everything. Here he is woefully miscast as King Edward VIII, and he steals whatever scenes he is present in, even the ones where he appears with Wallis Simpson. Considering `Bertie' would go on to become the future King George VI (the father of the current Queen Elizabeth), one would think that his story would be presented in perhaps a more sophisticated manner with the true history of the time perhaps brought to the fore some more.Bewilderingly, the real life speeches of the real King George VIth (present on the DVD) aren't as dramatic or overwrought as the fake ones presented in the movie. Hollywood obviously took poetic license here, but it does make you wonder if this entire thing is a non-story if there ever was one. ""The Kings Speech"" is an example of a film that had no reason to be made, other than bask in an undeserved spotlight during awards season only because it gets tick-marks on certain vital components (its is well filmed, and the costumes are of the Age). Considering the Academy at one point in time honored such classics such as Amadeus, Sophie's Choice or Out of Africa, to find them groveling and throwing awards to Julia Roberts in ""Erin Brokovich"", a horrific Gwyneth Paltrow in ""Shakespeare in Love"" or a dazed Colin Firth in ""The Kings Speech"" really speaks volumes about how far they've fallen, and the degeneration of their relevance by pandering to tepid popular fare.If at all a fan of the classics or a connoisseur of the arts and history, you might find ""The Kings Speech"" laughably bad. And that's because it is. Don't believe the hype - that's for the masses that don't know better. Lets just say that if you found ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" from 1969 or ""Mary Queen of Scots"" from 1972 to be `populist drivel', you will obviously hate this. Compared to more recent films of British history that also take license with real history, such as ""Elizabeth The Golden Age"", this film fares much, much worse.

1365153,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003UESJH4,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","There are many times when the film picked for best picture at the Oscars tend to be what many would consider the wrong film. Too often these days the award is given to a prestige picture, a film that no one saw and chances are that they won't even though it won the award. Popular pictures seem to be ignored for more artistic films. This past year saw a marriage of the two, a film that not only entertained and did decent at the box office but that told a solid tale without resorting to simplistic feats. That film arrives on DVD this week, THE KING'S SPEECH.Opening in 1925, the Duke of York, Albert Frederick Arthur George, was the younger of two brothers to King George V. Played here with a combination of weakness and strength by Colin Firth (who won the Oscar for best actor); Albert is a beaten man when it comes to all things royal. He knows his brother is heir to the crown and is fine with that. But he's had a problem since childhood that affects him on a daily basis. He is quite tongue tied with a stammer that impedes him from making any speeches whatsoever.Consulting doctor after doctor with the help of his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) he all but gives up hope. Then she hears of a doctor of a different sort, one who has a record of being able to help each patient sent his way.Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) is unconventional at best. An Australian now in London, he takes on case after case while hoping to land a career in the theatre. With the arrival of Elizabeth and sworn to secrecy, he sets the ground rules. It is he who will decided if he takes the case or not and when in his locale both men become equals. To make his point, he takes to calling Albert ""Bertie"", a nickname only members of the royal family have used in the past. While Albert isn't aware, Lionel understands it's not the symptoms that just need treated but the cause as well. And until Albert comes to grips with this, the cure will only be temporary.The two men work on a daily basis as Lionel helps Albert overcome his fears to a certain extent. He does improve but near as much as he would like. Still unable to make a public speech, setbacks occur more often when he's in the presence of his father or his more popular brother, Edward (Guy Pearce).At present Edward isn't quite so popular with his father. Haven taken up with a married woman named Mrs. Wallis Simpson doesn't sit well with either his father or the countries politicians. Should he take on the mantel of King he would also be the head of the Church of England, a church that doesn't believe in divorce or remarrying. And King he does become when his father passes away.Forced to choose between his love of Mrs. Simpson and his duties to his country, Edward rescinds the crown and Bertie is now next in line to become King. With the help of Logue, he makes it through the ceremony and is now King George VI. But fires are burning across Europe. Hitler is on the move and soon makes his play in Poland. And now Bertie must gather together his strength and inspire a nation with a speech. Has all the work paid off or not?Based on the true history of these two men, the film slowly develops not just the story but shows the development of the two men as well. One born into high society and the other the son of a drunk, they have little in common and yet learn more from one another than would be expected. And through their learning they become possibly the best friend that either of them has ever had.Not only did the film win for best picture it also garnered Oscars for best screenplay and best director. It deserved them both. Not only that, Rush should have won for best supporting actor as his part is as important to the story as Firth's character was. Did the film deserve the awards it was given? Most definitely. This is a story that inspires just with the tale alone. There are no outward heroics with guns blazing. Instead we are inspired by the courage of one man to face his fears, to overcome his disability and to become the voice of his nation.The true test to me of a good film is if I would consider watching it again. So many films are fun once but not a second or even third time. This is a film that will remain on my shelf and on occasion come down to be watched again. It truly is that good. It's not just a film that qualifies for a good rental, its worth owning.",5,A KING IN NEED,1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,4364,"['are', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'film', 'picked', 'best', 'picture', 'Oscars', 'tend', 'be', 'what', 'many', 'would', 'consider', 'wrong', 'film', 'Too', 'often', 'days', 'award', 'given', 'prestige', 'picture', 'film', 'one', 'saw', 'chances', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'won', 'award', 'Popular', 'pictures', 'seem', 'be', 'ignored', 'more', 'artistic', 'films', 'past', 'year', 'saw', 'marriage', 'two', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'entertained', 'did', 'decent', 'box', 'office', 'told', 'solid', 'tale', 'resorting', 'simplistic', 'feats', 'film', 'DVD', 'week', 'THE', 'KING', 'SPEECH.Opening', '1925', 'Duke', 'York', 'Albert', 'Frederick', 'Arthur', 'George', 'was', 'younger', 'two', 'brothers', 'King', 'George', 'V.', 'Played', 'here', 'combination', 'weakness', 'strength', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'actor', 'Albert', 'beaten', 'man', 'when', 'things', 'royal', 'brother', 'heir', 'crown', 'fine', 'had', 'problem', 'childhood', 'daily', 'basis', 'quite', 'tongue', 'tied', 'stammer', 'making', 'speeches', 'whatsoever.Consulting', 'doctor', 'doctor', 'help', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'up', 'hope', 'Then', 'doctor', 'different', 'sort', 'one', 'who', 'record', 'being', 'able', 'help', 'patient', 'sent', 'way.Lionel', 'Logue', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'unconventional', 'best', 'Australian', 'now', 'London', 'case', 'case', 'hoping', 'land', 'career', 'theatre', 'arrival', 'Elizabeth', 'sworn', 'secrecy', 'ground', 'rules', 'who', 'will', 'decided', 'case', 'not', 'when', 'locale', 'men', 'become', 'equals', 'make', 'point', 'calling', 'Albert', 'Bertie', 'nickname', 'only', 'members', 'royal', 'family', 'have', 'used', 'past', 'Albert', ""n't"", 'aware', 'Lionel', 'not', 'symptoms', 'just', 'need', 'treated', 'cause', 'well', 'Albert', 'grips', 'cure', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'temporary.The', 'two', 'men', 'work', 'daily', 'basis', 'Lionel', 'Albert', 'overcome', 'fears', 'certain', 'extent', 'improve', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'Still', 'unable', 'make', 'public', 'speech', 'setbacks', 'occur', 'more', 'often', 'when', 'presence', 'father', 'more', 'popular', 'brother', 'Edward', 'Guy', 'Pearce', '.At', 'present', 'Edward', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'popular', 'father', 'Haven', 'taken', 'up', 'married', 'woman', 'named', 'Mrs.', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'father', 'countries', 'politicians', 'Should', 'take', 'mantel', 'King', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'head', 'Church', 'England', 'church', ""n't"", 'believe', 'divorce', 'remarrying', 'King', 'become', 'when', 'father', 'passes', 'away.Forced', 'choose', 'love', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson', 'duties', 'country', 'Edward', 'crown', 'Bertie', 'now', 'next', 'line', 'become', 'King', 'help', 'Logue', 'ceremony', 'now', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'fires', 'are', 'burning', 'Europe', 'Hitler', 'move', 'soon', 'play', 'Poland', 'now', 'Bertie', 'must', 'gather', 'together', 'strength', 'inspire', 'nation', 'speech', 'Has', 'work', 'paid', 'off', 'not', 'Based', 'true', 'history', 'two', 'men', 'film', 'slowly', 'not', 'just', 'story', 'development', 'two', 'men', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'born', 'high', 'society', 'other', 'son', 'drunk', 'have', 'little', 'common', 'yet', 'learn', 'more', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'learning', 'become', 'possibly', 'best', 'friend', 'ever', 'had.Not', 'only', 'did', 'film', 'win', 'best', 'picture', 'also', 'garnered', 'Oscars', 'best', 'screenplay', 'best', 'director', 'deserved', 'Not', 'only', 'Rush', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'part', 'as', 'important', 'story', 'Firth', 'character', 'was', 'Did', 'film', 'deserve', 'awards', 'was', 'given', 'Most', 'definitely', 'story', 'just', 'tale', 'alone', 'are', 'outward', 'heroics', 'guns', 'blazing', 'Instead', 'are', 'inspired', 'courage', 'one', 'man', 'face', 'fears', 'overcome', 'disability', 'become', 'voice', 'nation.The', 'true', 'test', 'good', 'film', 'would', 'consider', 'watching', 'again', 'So', 'many', 'films', 'are', 'fun', 'once', 'not', 'second', 'even', 'third', 'time', 'film', 'will', 'remain', 'shelf', 'occasion', 'come', 'be', 'watched', 'again', 'truly', 'good', 'not', 'just', 'film', 'good', 'rental', 'worth', 'owning']",N/A
1365154,AAYE34TCTNV2R,B003UESJH4,MarlowesMom,"[0, 1]","""The King's Speech"" is a perfectly good, Masterpiece-Theatre sort of movie that does not in any way live up to all the praise and awards heaped on it. As other reviewers have noted, it's Oscar bait: a period piece with great attention to detail, World War II on the horizon (Oscar loves World War II), a triumph over personal adversity, and a prestigious cast with English accents.I don't think anyone doesn't know the simple plot but just in case SPOILER ALERT: Albert, the second son of England's King George V, has a severe stammer that makes public speaking torture for him and his audiences. A year after his father's death, he is forced to take the throne as George VI when his older brother, Edward VIII, abdicates to marry the twice-divorced American parvenue Wallis Simpson. Lionel Logue is a failed Australian actor who sets himself up in London as a speech therapist. The film covers the professional and personal relationship that develops between Logue and the King as they strive to control the King's stammer enough that he can address and inspire his people when necessary.The casting and performances are almost uniformly excellent. Helena Bonham Carter brings a delightful balance of hauteur and humor to the underwritten role of Queen Elizabeth. Geoffrey Rush, who can be an awful ham, is understated and convincing as Logue. Eve Best is pitch-perfect in her small role as Wallis Simpson. Guy Pearce brings Edward VIII's combination of good looks, charm and selfish petulance to life. Michael Gambon and Claire Bloom haunt the movie as George VI's distant, demanding parents, George V and Queen Mary. Colin Firth does not look as much like his real life counterpart as the other actors, but his characterization of the reluctant King as a decent man, forced by circumstances into a role for which he is ill-suited and does not want, but determined to serve his country to the best of his ability, is entirely convincing. Firth, Rush and Carter make you care, very much, how things turn out for the King. My only qualm with the casting was Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill. I like Spall as an actor, but he reminded me of Churchill about as much as French bulldog reminds me of an English bulldog, which is to say hardly at all.The production design is lovely--my goodness, how often does one remark favorably on the wallpaper in a movie?Part of the movie's weakness is the script.  I happen to know this chapter of history pretty well, but found myself constantly having to answer ""why is this happening?"" questions for my husband and son. (It may be of interest that an 8-year-old boy found this movie pretty engaging for the most part--and I found the swear words in this R-rated movie far less objectionable than the violence in many PG-13s.) The script covers a lot of  ground, but it doesn't go very deep--perhaps because there just isn't that far to go.I'm an Anglophile and I get a kick out of the Royal Family. I enjoyed this movie very much for these reasons and the fact that it's well done.However, ""The King's Speech"" is neither a terribly dramatic drama nor a hilariously funny comedy, it doesn't have much quotable dialogue, and it just doesn't seem like the sort of memorable film-making that should be a ""Best Picture"" winner.  It's not the first Oscar-winner that didn't live up to its hype, and it won't be the last. It is, however, a good movie, well worth your time if you are interested in this particular slice of history and enjoy good acting.",4,A  Nice Little Movie,1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,3487,"['King', 'Speech', 'perfectly', 'good', 'Masterpiece-Theatre', 'sort', 'movie', 'not', 'way', 'live', 'up', 'praise', 'awards', 'heaped', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'Oscar', 'bait', 'period', 'piece', 'great', 'attention', 'detail', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'horizon', 'Oscar', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'triumph', 'personal', 'adversity', 'prestigious', 'cast', 'English', 'accents.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', ""n't"", 'know', 'simple', 'plot', 'just', 'case', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Albert', 'second', 'son', 'England', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'severe', 'stammer', 'public', 'speaking', 'torture', 'audiences', 'year', 'father', 'death', 'forced', 'take', 'throne', 'George', 'VI', 'when', 'older', 'brother', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'marry', 'twice-divorced', 'American', 'parvenue', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'failed', 'Australian', 'actor', 'who', 'up', 'London', 'speech', 'therapist', 'film', 'professional', 'personal', 'relationship', 'Logue', 'King', 'strive', 'control', 'King', 'stammer', 'enough', 'can', 'address', 'inspire', 'people', 'when', 'necessary.The', 'casting', 'performances', 'are', 'almost', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'delightful', 'balance', 'hauteur', 'humor', 'underwritten', 'role', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'awful', 'ham', 'understated', 'convincing', 'Logue', 'Eve', 'Best', 'pitch-perfect', 'small', 'role', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'combination', 'good', 'looks', 'charm', 'selfish', 'petulance', 'life', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'haunt', 'movie', 'George', 'VI', 'distant', 'demanding', 'parents', 'George', 'V', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'not', 'look', 'as', 'much', 'real', 'life', 'counterpart', 'other', 'actors', 'characterization', 'reluctant', 'King', 'decent', 'man', 'forced', 'circumstances', 'role', 'ill-suited', 'not', 'want', 'determined', 'serve', 'country', 'best', 'ability', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'Firth', 'Rush', 'Carter', 'make', 'care', 'very', 'much', 'how', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'King', 'only', 'qualm', 'casting', 'was', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'like', 'Spall', 'actor', 'reminded', 'Churchill', 'as', 'much', 'French', 'bulldog', 'English', 'bulldog', 'say', 'hardly', 'all.The', 'production', 'design', 'lovely', 'goodness', 'how', 'often', 'one', 'remark', 'favorably', 'wallpaper', 'movie', 'Part', 'movie', 'weakness', 'script', 'happen', 'know', 'chapter', 'history', 'pretty', 'well', 'found', 'constantly', 'having', 'answer', 'why', 'happening', 'questions', 'husband', 'son', 'may', 'be', 'interest', '8-year-old', 'boy', 'found', 'movie', 'pretty', 'engaging', 'most', 'part', 'found', 'swear', 'words', 'R-rated', 'movie', 'far', 'less', 'objectionable', 'violence', 'many', 'PG-13s', 'script', 'lot', 'ground', ""n't"", 'go', 'very', 'deep', 'perhaps', 'just', ""n't"", 'that', 'far', 'go.I', ""'m"", 'Anglophile', 'get', 'kick', 'Royal', 'Family', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'reasons', 'fact', 'well', 'done.However', 'King', 'Speech', 'terribly', 'dramatic', 'drama', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'quotable', 'dialogue', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'sort', 'memorable', 'film-making', 'should', 'be', 'Best', 'Picture', 'winner', 'not', 'first', 'Oscar-winner', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'last', 'however', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'time', 'are', 'interested', 'particular', 'slice', 'history', 'enjoy', 'good', 'acting']",N/A

It's an interesting glimpse into the lives of the Royals in the modern era--a particularly dark chapter of the modern era, at that. All of the characters were memorable, even the bit players. The girls who played young Elizabeth and Margaret were realistically portrayed without being cloying. Bertie's transformation into George VI is allowed to develop with all the nuances of his changing private-to-public role and the ""sticky wicket"" situation of his brother's abdication and subsequent marriage to an American divorcee. It also seemed clear that King Edward's personal life was such a distraction for him that he really didn't have much of a handle on world events as they sped up, and that Bertie/George had a far better understanding of Hitler's war machine and Britain's role in addressing it. I guess I always thought the abdication-forced transition was much smoother, and that it didn't matter who was seated on the throne.  If the movie is accurate, though, it was a stroke of good fortune that the monarch ended up being George.I expected Bertie's relationship with Logue to be compelling, and it is.  Obviously the men had a high regard for each other aside from the fact that one was monarch and the other gave the king his voice.I was not prepared for how witty the script was--it's not just a straightforward treatment of sessions with a speech therapist. The audience really comes to like the King and Logue, and to root for their success.It wasn't easy being Bertie--there's mention of his brother John, who died at the age of 13 from an epileptic seizure.  John's story was one of the sadder royal tales--he was hidden away because he was mentally challenged, although by all accounts he was a kind, affectionate child. Several sources say that Bertie loved John, but the princes' lives were so structured and appearances were so important, John was removed from the public eye. But losing John was only one of the childhood traumas Bertie endured. Bertie's early life no doubt had a huge impact on his developing stammer.This is an excellent biopic,but make sure you watch the version that has not been edited to ""clean up"" the language.  The controversy forcing a PG rating because of a profanity is silliness that never should have happened.

Sherwin,"[2, 2]","The King's Speech is one of those truly rare films that grabbed my attention and held it all the way through even though I knew how it would all end--this story is well known to many historians and some non-historians like myself know at least parts of the tale. The film succeeds because of the excellent acting by a five star cast; and the musical score is exceptional. The choreography and the cinematography impressed me as well. The plot moves along smoothly without being boring or excessively melodramatic.The film starts in 1925 and King George V of England (Michael Gambon) asks his second son, The Duke of York (Colin Firth), to make a closing speech at The Empire Exhibition in Wembley, London. The Duke of York dreads public speaking because he suffers from an embarrassing problem with stuttering. The speech does not go well; together he and his wife (Helena Bonham Carter, who would become Queen Elizabeth), try just about every doctor, specialist and speech therapist to no avail. After some time, however, the future Queen Elizabeth discovers an Australian speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush); and she convinces her husband to try Lionel's unconventional treatments which combine speech therapy with physical exercises, humor and some kindly psychotherapy.We also see things becoming more complicated with the passage of time. The Duke's father, King George V, grows old, becomes disoriented and dies; this makes his first son King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce). Yet King Edward VIII was romantically involved with a twice divorced woman named Wallis Simpson (Eve Best); and it isn't long before he abdicates the throne to marry her--leaving his brother, The Duke of York, still with a speech problem, in the uncomfortable position of having to ascend to the throne. Worse yet for the new King is that he becomes England's leader at a time when Europe was headed toward war with Germany and almost certainly other countries as well.I could tell you much more; I've already left out some of the plot and I won't write about the rest so I don't ruin it for you! Suffice it to say that the story plays out with elegance and poignancy and much credit is due to the actors, especially Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. In addition, look for solid performances by Roger Parrott as Neville Chamberlain; Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill; Jennifer Ehle as Myrtle Logue and Derek Jacobi as Archbishop Cosmo Lang.The DVD has an optional running commentary with director Tom Hooper; a featurette entitled The King's Speech: An Inspirational Story of an Unlikely Friendship; a Q&A; session with the director and the cast; another featurette about the real Lionel Logue--and more!The King's Speech is a brilliant and most sensitive portrayal of the man who hesitantly became King George VI of England as he conquered his speech disability with the help of a kindly, unconventional therapist. The friendship these two men gradually develop is touching as well. The other characters in this film are faultlessly showcased, too. I recommend this film for anyone who likes inspiring dramas based very much on real life events; and fans of the actors in this film would do well to get this for their collections.",5,"inspirational, poignant and even witty at times",1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,3220,"['King', 'Speech', 'one', 'truly', 'rare', 'films', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'held', 'way', 'even', 'knew', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'story', 'well', 'known', 'many', 'historians', 'non-historians', 'know', 'least', 'parts', 'tale', 'film', 'excellent', 'acting', 'five', 'star', 'cast', 'musical', 'score', 'exceptional', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'impressed', 'well', 'plot', 'moves', 'smoothly', 'being', 'boring', 'excessively', 'melodramatic.The', 'film', 'starts', '1925', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'England', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'second', 'son', 'Duke', 'York', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'make', 'closing', 'speech', 'Empire', 'Exhibition', 'Wembley', 'London', 'Duke', 'York', 'dreads', 'public', 'speaking', 'embarrassing', 'problem', 'stuttering', 'speech', 'not', 'go', 'well', 'wife', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'try', 'just', 'doctor', 'specialist', 'speech', 'therapist', 'avail', 'time', 'however', 'future', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Australian', 'speech', 'therapist', 'named', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'husband', 'try', 'Lionel', 'unconventional', 'treatments', 'combine', 'speech', 'therapy', 'physical', 'exercises', 'humor', 'kindly', 'psychotherapy.We', 'also', 'see', 'things', 'becoming', 'more', 'complicated', 'passage', 'time', 'Duke', 'father', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'old', 'becomes', 'disoriented', 'first', 'son', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'was', 'romantically', 'involved', 'twice', 'divorced', 'woman', 'named', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'Eve', 'Best', ""n't"", 'long', 'throne', 'marry', 'leaving', 'brother', 'Duke', 'York', 'still', 'speech', 'problem', 'uncomfortable', 'position', 'having', 'ascend', 'throne', 'Worse', 'yet', 'new', 'King', 'England', 'leader', 'time', 'when', 'Europe', 'was', 'headed', 'war', 'Germany', 'almost', 'certainly', 'other', 'countries', 'well.I', 'could', 'tell', 'much', 'more', ""'ve"", 'already', 'left', 'out', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'write', 'rest', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'Suffice', 'say', 'story', 'out', 'elegance', 'poignancy', 'much', 'credit', 'due', 'actors', 'especially', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'addition', 'look', 'solid', 'performances', 'Roger', 'Parrott', 'Neville', 'Chamberlain', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Myrtle', 'Logue', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Archbishop', 'Cosmo', 'Lang.The', 'DVD', 'optional', 'running', 'commentary', 'director', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'King', 'Speech', 'Inspirational', 'Story', 'Unlikely', 'Friendship', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'director', 'cast', 'featurette', 'real', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'more', 'King', 'Speech', 'brilliant', 'most', 'sensitive', 'portrayal', 'man', 'who', 'hesitantly', 'became', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'England', 'conquered', 'speech', 'disability', 'help', 'kindly', 'unconventional', 'therapist', 'friendship', 'two', 'men', 'gradually', 'develop', 'touching', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'faultlessly', 'showcased', 'too', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'inspiring', 'dramas', 'based', 'very', 'much', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'fans', 'actors', 'film', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'get', 'collections']",N/A

And speech impediments seem to be almost taboo in the entertainment world. although not completely overlooked...Sloth from the Goonies had one. The comedian in Fish Called Wanda had One. There is that black boxer who has a bit of a lisp, isn't there? But I'm digressing.It doesnt take a psychologist to take one look at the cover of this DVD and know that in this film, Colin Firth (who plays the king who has to say a speech to his friends) does not see his vocal disability as an 'impediment', he sees it more as a 'uniqueness'. He is a proud man,who holds himself with dignity and pride despite his shameful, embarrassing vocal incontinence. However, it DOES take a psychologist to look deeper into Colin 'The King' Firths dark eyes to see that there is also a gnawing insecurity there, a dread of the speech that he knows he'll have to say before the film ends.That's where the old man in a suit on the left of the DVD cover comes in.He may not look like much, but he is an incredibly valuable remedy to King Colin's speech problems. He is an old and very quirky man who is speech therapist.Although the lovable duo dont take an instant liking of eachother due to The King not being able to talk properly, soon the King learns how to talk like normal people, with the support of his therapist, his wife, his country and fundamentally HIMSELF.A wonderful tale of one man and the probs that he must overcome.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[5, 5]","THE KING'S SPEECH is everything that a great movie should be.It tells a good story and it tells it well.After the death of his father (Michael Gambon) and the scandalous abdication of his older brother (Guy Pearce), Bertie (Colin Firth), who has suffered from a debilitating speech impediment all his life, is suddenly crowned King George VI of England.With the country on the brink of war, his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) arranges for her husband to see an eccentric speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), and after a rough start, the two delve into an unorthodox course of treatment that will cure the monarch's stammer and help him find the voice to encourage his people.David Seidler's well-crafted screenplay and Tom Hooper's sensitive direction transports us back to a not-so-long-ago era of innocence when the world was about to be shattered, once again, by war.The film, which covers two decades, spends much of its time dealing with court intrigues, primarily involving the affair between Edward VIII (Pearce) and his affair with twice-divorced Wallis Simpson.However, the spine of this story is the relationship and growing friendship between two men, the future king (Firth) and a commoner (Rush), who helps the ruler overcome his disability and become the inspiration of his nation.The performances by the entire cast, including Timothy Spall (as Churchill), Derek Jacobi, Claire Bloom and Anthony Andrews are perfect.  They transform names from out history books into real, multi-dimensional people.Some writers have commented that THE KING'S SPEECH is historically inaccurate, in that it glosses over Edward's possible Nazi sympathies.Seidler's script touches briefly on that issue, but one must remember that this is not a documentary, but a dramatic presentation of actual events.  This film is not about Edward.  He is merely a supporting player in a story that centers on his brother and Lionel Logue.Frankly, I think a future film that deals with Edward's sympathies toward Hitler and his cronies would make fascinating viewing.THE KING'S SPEECH marks one of the very rare times in recent years where my favorite movie of the year has won the Best Picture Oscar.Perhaps there's hope for the Academy yet.

1365182,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B003UESJH4,mirasreviews,"[0, 0]","Tom Hooper is making a name for himself directing period films in a meticulous and creative style, and ""The King's Speech"" is a striking example. Like ""The Damned United"" (2009), this is a compelling true story about a powerful man struggling with the burdens of his own personality -that takes a few more liberties with history than may have been necessary. The screenplay was written by David Seidler, who suffered from a stammer as a boy and was inspired by King George VI's struggle with the same affliction. Some critics have said that the King's stammer is exaggerated in the film, but the more significant historical inaccuracies are found in subplots concerning King Edward VIII's abdication and the King's views of an increasingly belligerent Germany.King George VI's personal struggle is affecting and a pleasure to watch, however. The film begins in 1925, when Prince Albert, Duke of York (Colin Firth), fails miserably to address a crowd Wembley Stadium due to his stammer. It ends in 1939, when King George VI must announce Great Britain's entry into war with Germany in a radio address to the nation and the world. In between, we observe the Duke's -later King's- relationship with unconventional Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a elocutionist with no formal credentials who helped shell-shocked soldiers recover their speech after World War I. Logue understood that stammers and stutters had emotional sources and developed techniques to help his patients overcome their fears.Lionel Logue's diaries were recently located, but only a couple of months before filming began. Some authentic dialogue was added to the script, but the personal interactions between the King and Logue are mostly speculation. Some of it strains credibility, like the swearing sessions and Logue calling the King ""Bertie"". I could have done without these particular clich&eacute;s. But the visual style and performances of Colin Firth, as the King, and Helena Bonham Carter as his wife Elizabeth are fantastic. As sympathetic as they are witty. King George VI had the misfortune to become a monarch unexpectedly during the brief period when Kings addressed the nation on live radio, while he suffered from a stammer. And it became his duty to overcome that flaw.The DVD (Weinstein 2011): ""Speeches for the Real King George VI"" allows us to listen to 2 real speeches, made 5 1/2 years apart, including one we see in the film. ""The Real Lionel Logue"" (10 minutes) interviews his grandson Mark Logue about his grandfather and the information in his diaries. ""Q&A; with Director and Cast"" (22 min) is a question and answer session with Tom Hooper, Colin Firth, Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, and Claire Bloom. ""The King's Speech: An Inspirational Story of an Unlikely Friendship"" (24 min) interviews the cast about their roles and the director about the story and characters. The audio commentary by director Tom Hooper is constant and informative. He addresses his decisions scene by scene, production design, locations, score, period details, performances, and more.

1365197,A3DDPQ9342UNMY,B003UESJH4,"N. Doyle ""film buff""","[0, 1]","THE KING'S SPEECH may not be a truly great film but it comes close. The acting is splendid, the costumes well-researched, the background score including some classic pieces of Mozart and Beethoven is inspiring, and Tom Hooper's direction is admirable.What hampers the film is the fact that its protagonist, a stuttering man (Colin Firth) who must ascend the throne when his brother (Guy Pearce) abdicates, is really quite a dull man with a fierce temper and an inability to express himself as a person until he meets the challenge of a speech therapist. But for all his courage in overcoming his handicap, he keeps the story from moving forward until the last thirty minutes when the story's stature becomes more important because of the impending threat from Hitler and WWII.However, it must be said that Colin Firth plays King George VI with gusto, matched only by Geoffrey Rush as Mr. Logue, his therapist. The two of them create sparks in many a confrontational moment of truth, and each has a firm grip on their roles. Equally proficient, but less noticeable and given a smaller amount of screen time, is Helena Bonham Carter as the gracious and adoring woman who stands by her stubborn man and presides over a household of two children, one of whom is a future Queen of England. In a lesser but still rich role, Guy Pearce is excellent as Edward VIII.But unfortunately, because of the film's preoccupation with King George's speech impediment, the film moves forward at a snail's pace and only becomes more urgent during the final half hour when the world awaits the king's reaction to the news that Great Britain has failed to prevent war with Germany.All the technical merits make the film outstanding in various departments, particularly the cinematography, costumes, settings and music. Colin Firth deserved his Oscar and Geoffrey Rush would have deserved a nomination as a Best Actor rather than Best Supporting Actor since his role his clearly a co-starring one.More importantly, the film does a grand job of humanizing the Royals.",4,King George VI conquers his stuttering in a film that humanizes the Royals...,1305331200,"05 14, 2011",2011,2043,"['KING', 'SPEECH', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'close', 'acting', 'splendid', 'costumes', 'well-researched', 'background', 'score', 'including', 'classic', 'pieces', 'Mozart', 'Beethoven', 'inspiring', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'direction', 'hampers', 'film', 'fact', 'protagonist', 'stuttering', 'man', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'who', 'must', 'ascend', 'throne', 'when', 'brother', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'really', 'quite', 'dull', 'man', 'fierce', 'temper', 'inability', 'express', 'person', 'challenge', 'speech', 'therapist', 'courage', 'overcoming', 'handicap', 'story', 'moving', 'forward', 'last', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'when', 'story', 'stature', 'more', 'important', 'impending', 'threat', 'Hitler', 'WWII.However', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'gusto', 'matched', 'only', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Mr.', 'Logue', 'therapist', 'two', 'create', 'sparks', 'many', 'confrontational', 'moment', 'truth', 'firm', 'grip', 'roles', 'Equally', 'proficient', 'less', 'noticeable', 'given', 'smaller', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'gracious', 'adoring', 'woman', 'who', 'stubborn', 'man', 'household', 'two', 'children', 'one', 'whom', 'future', 'Queen', 'England', 'lesser', 'still', 'rich', 'role', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'excellent', 'Edward', 'VIII.But', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'preoccupation', 'King', 'George', 'speech', 'impediment', 'film', 'forward', 'snail', 'pace', 'only', 'more', 'urgent', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'when', 'world', 'king', 'reaction', 'news', 'Great', 'Britain', 'failed', 'prevent', 'war', 'Germany.All', 'technical', 'merits', 'make', 'film', 'outstanding', 'various', 'departments', 'particularly', 'cinematography', 'costumes', 'settings', 'music', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'would', 'have', 'deserved', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actor', 'rather', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'role', 'clearly', 'co-starring', 'one.More', 'importantly', 'film', 'grand', 'job', 'humanizing', 'Royals']",N/A

1365204,A12FLZREV32JOP,B003UESJH4,Noelle Eiram,"[8, 11]","The King's Speech is neither the most complex nor the most original film of the year, but this beautiful film stands out in that it requires the audience to have an attention span. The movie follows Prince Albert (Colin Firth), nicknamed Bertie, in Pre-World War II England as he attempts to overcome, or at least cope with, his stammer. His wife Her Royal Highness Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) recruits Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) and so begins Bertie's unconventional path to Kinghood and self-acceptance.Visuals are sometimes self-conscious and even cartoonish, but coloring is used to excellent effect. Lionel encourages Bertie to break away from social constraints, and his space is appropriately off-kilter, while the foreboding, increasingly dark shots of Bertie's surroundings have the effect of a vice. A stunning Colin Firth successfully conveys Bertie's vulnerability, which is made all the more harrowing because of his lack of self-pity. Geoffrey Rush complements Firth's performance and brings his delightful dialog to life as the alternately cheeky and tender Lionel.Bertie's history of pain and stress is expressed in his body. The mechanical advice of physicians of the day falls flat, as does the advice to merely ""relax."" Lionel offers a deeper connection, one which will likely inspire numerous viewers who have struggled with feelings of inadequacy and isolation. The film highlights the strict social structure as a source of damaging pressure. Bertie's life has almost no relationship to his struggling subjects, and yet the descriptions of his upbringing are horrifying. Lionel has a content family but, as an Australian, faces frequent prejudice. In spite of its heaviness, the film is quite funny as well. Bertie's dry sense of humor and Lionel's insouciance light up many a scene and amplify the more serious moments.The two most interesting minor characters are Bertie's father King George V (Michael Gambon) and brother David (Guy Pearce), later King Edward VII, both of whom play a major role in Bertie's pathology. Gambon's George is a man with little patience for weakness, and Pearce's David is a silly, unfortunate product of his family.Helena Bonham Carter does well with a less fleshed-out part. Lionel's wife (played by Jennifer Ehle) may be too perfect, but Lionel's and Bertie's families are portrayed with a light, lovely touch. Winston Churchill (Timothy Spall) is a purely positive and somewhat simplistic figure, and Archbishop Cosmo Lang (Derek Jacobi) is almost pure oiliness. Still, most characters are believable and very much of their time. Even the most progressive characters do not seem to be artificially implanted with modern ideas.The horrors of World War I quietly hang over the characters, making the impending World War II all the more forboding. This might have been a more powerful film had it focused more on the threat ahead. Whatever the case, the painfully beautiful climax evokes a sense of both tragedy and victory and manages to be simultaneously heartrending and uplifting.The King's Speech is less a political study than a poignant depiction of the power in treating another like a human being, even a king.",5,4.5 stars (I'll round up),1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,3208,"['King', 'Speech', 'most', 'complex', 'most', 'original', 'film', 'year', 'beautiful', 'film', 'out', 'audience', 'have', 'attention', 'span', 'movie', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'nicknamed', 'Bertie', 'Pre-World', 'War', 'II', 'England', 'overcome', 'least', 'cope', 'stammer', 'wife', 'Royal', 'Highness', 'Elizabeth', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Australian', 'speech', 'therapist', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'so', 'Bertie', 'unconventional', 'path', 'Kinghood', 'self-acceptance.Visuals', 'are', 'sometimes', 'self-conscious', 'even', 'cartoonish', 'coloring', 'used', 'excellent', 'effect', 'Lionel', 'Bertie', 'break', 'away', 'social', 'constraints', 'space', 'appropriately', 'off-kilter', 'foreboding', 'increasingly', 'dark', 'shots', 'Bertie', 'surroundings', 'have', 'effect', 'vice', 'stunning', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'successfully', 'Bertie', 'vulnerability', 'made', 'more', 'harrowing', 'lack', 'self-pity', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Firth', 'performance', 'delightful', 'dialog', 'life', 'alternately', 'cheeky', 'tender', 'Lionel.Bertie', 'history', 'pain', 'stress', 'expressed', 'body', 'mechanical', 'advice', 'physicians', 'day', 'flat', 'advice', 'merely', 'relax', 'Lionel', 'deeper', 'connection', 'one', 'will', 'likely', 'inspire', 'numerous', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'struggled', 'feelings', 'inadequacy', 'isolation', 'film', 'strict', 'social', 'structure', 'source', 'damaging', 'pressure', 'Bertie', 'life', 'almost', 'relationship', 'struggling', 'subjects', 'yet', 'descriptions', 'upbringing', 'are', 'horrifying', 'Lionel', 'content', 'family', 'Australian', 'frequent', 'prejudice', 'spite', 'heaviness', 'film', 'quite', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'Bertie', 'dry', 'sense', 'humor', 'Lionel', 'insouciance', 'light', 'up', 'many', 'scene', 'amplify', 'more', 'serious', 'moments.The', 'two', 'most', 'interesting', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'Bertie', 'father', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'brother', 'David', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'later', 'King', 'Edward', 'VII', 'whom', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'Bertie', 'pathology', 'Gambon', 'George', 'man', 'little', 'patience', 'weakness', 'Pearce', 'David', 'silly', 'unfortunate', 'product', 'family.Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'well', 'less', 'fleshed-out', 'part', 'Lionel', 'wife', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'perfect', 'Lionel', 'Bertie', 'families', 'are', 'portrayed', 'light', 'lovely', 'touch', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'purely', 'positive', 'somewhat', 'simplistic', 'figure', 'Archbishop', 'Cosmo', 'Lang', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'almost', 'pure', 'oiliness', 'Still', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'very', 'much', 'time', 'Even', 'most', 'progressive', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'artificially', 'implanted', 'modern', 'ideas.The', 'horrors', 'World', 'War', 'quietly', 'hang', 'characters', 'making', 'impending', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'more', 'forboding', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'powerful', 'film', 'had', 'focused', 'more', 'threat', 'ahead', 'Whatever', 'case', 'painfully', 'beautiful', 'climax', 'sense', 'tragedy', 'victory', 'manages', 'be', 'simultaneously', 'heartrending', 'uplifting.The', 'King', 'Speech', 'less', 'political', 'study', 'poignant', 'depiction', 'power', 'treating', 'human', 'being', 'even', 'king']",N/A

1365207,A1NMGCWGJ0BGVD,B003UESJH4,nottheaveragemoviegoer,"[22, 53]","Based on the story of King George VI trying to overcome a stutter in time to motivate Britain during the brink of World War II, The King's Speech gives us big-name Brits like Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush (okay, he's Australian, but it still counts), and Helena Bonham Carter to tell us this motivational tale of a man who would be king. This movie is neck-in-neck with The Social Network in the Best Picture race, but is it the best movie? No. Is it a bad movie? Not even. This movie was what you would expect from an inspirational movie and then some, but it seems too much like another inspirational movie called The Blind Side. You had someone come out of nowhere do something considerably crazy to a somewhat lost cause that, in the end, makes him come out stronger than ever.Colin Firth plays Albert, the Duke of York, who has to make public speeches but has a bad stutter and is thus afraid to talk. His wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), consults a speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) who is known for his unorthodox yet effective methods of therapy in Australia and also enjoys acting Shakespeare without any success. The resulting buildup and partnership leads to a friendship that becomes just as strong as the future king's ability to speak becomes in the end.Firth is getting a reputation for this role as he has won the ""Best Actor"" from almost every single critic's circle out there as well as the Golden Globe for this role, partially because he can actually make a convincing stutter. He really made his character seem natural and believable, which is hard for a character like his. Helena Bonham Carter's performance didn't leave much of an impression because she always seems to have a very still, calculating face with little emotion that only comes out through her voice. The role that stood out the most, however, was Geoffrey Rush. He made just about every scene that he was in with Firth entertaining, interesting, and at times really funny. His performance probably deserves the Best Supporting Actor Oscar more than Christian Bale, but I haven't seen The Fighter, so I really can't tell.The movie does benefit of having a great ensemble, but that was because it benefitted from big-named talents, so that really doesn't reflect much on the director. The inspirational arc that this movie has is similar to, like I said, other movies like The Blind Side and Stand and Deliver. In fact, if you were to pair this movie with Blind Side, you can easily pick out the similarities, especially the final scene. The story itself isn't bad, and it does have the heart needed to make this movie work, even if it does come across a little too much by trying to make the audience root for this guy when the burden comes crashing down on him and putting in some obvious moments like George proclaiming ""I have a voice"". My only real big criticism, besides the arc, is on the camerawork of this film. The camera puts the actors on the corner or on the far side of the screen as opposed to the center, which if you're going to put a backdrop or some form of movement that goes with the scene is fine, but there wasn't any, so why not put the characters in the center?Bottom Line: The King's Speech is good like The Blind Side is good. It does suffer from the inspirational schmaltz at times, but it's pretty good. The acting is great from Firth and Rush, it does build up in an entertaining and even funny way, and it does have heart.

1365211,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B003UESJH4,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[3, 4]","You know a film has worked when it defies your best intentions. Not being especially fond of historical dramas, British High Society or (perhaps because he has tended to exemplify both) Colin Firth, but buoyed by exemplary reviews (usually hard-as-nails FT critic Nigel Andrews reported being left in tears) I went along to The King's Speech determined to be analytical about it: weighing up frame composition, lighting, and so on - and intending to frame my review in terms the picture's success at the technical art of film making. I quite like that sort of thing. I got as far as noticing how nicely the frames were composed - the opening scene is an extreme wide shot of the  1925 Empire Exhibition at the Crystal Palace, itself disappearing into the fog, and punctuated dead centre by an antique microphone, suspended on the cross-hairs of its shock-mount. The frame is reversed and the crosshairs are revealed to be trained like a sniper target on poor old stammering Duke of York, at that stage still Albert prior to his character's coronation as George VI in 1936.At that point in the film, three minutes in, wherein the Duke's glottal stops, gag reflexes and not much else ricochet emptily around the blanketed arena like stray crossfire, the assembled multitude looks guiltily at its shoes, my critical aspirations were neutered as the exquisite melodrama swept me away. The best I managed for the remainder of the film was to note the repeated use of extreme wide-angle lens (any wider and it would have been fish eye) to accentuate the magnitude of the buildings and, I suppose the institutions this poor chap was expected to inhabit.Now I said I wasn't especially fond of Colin Firth as an actor, but I am now. Mr Firth utterly brings you in to the enormity of the world his character inhabits: it is a superb piece of acting. I dare say we've all reflected from time to time how awful it would be, in practice, to be royalty, but Firth's delicate yet assured performance makes it all so plain. You feel all of his pain: Unlike anyone else on the planet if pomp and ceremony, or for that matter complete isolation from casual friendship, is not your thing, you've simply no choice. To abdicate (the option favoured by Albert's older brother Edward) is to consign yourself forever into the wilderness of caricatured villainy. It had never happened before in the history of the British monarchy. But - so The King's Speech would have it - Edward was not cut out to be king. He was not of the right stuff. George VI, against his own better judgment, was.So at its heart, in the King's Speech you have an achingly sorry story about a shy man compelled to speak boldly to a whole nation at its darkest time. That would be enough for a good film, but the surrounding performances, and the excellent screenplay, catapult it further.Having tried all manner of cures, the disconsolate Duke's persevering wife is given one last recommendation: a particular Harley Street elocutionist by the name of Logue. Against all convention she pays him a visit. We immediately know something is not right as the elevator lurches downward, not upward, to a sparsely furnished basement with wrecked wallpaper and no receptionist. She is greeted directly by the elocutionist, a shirt-sleeved Australian, and he makes a facile excuse for not having a secretary. Nor does he make concessions for his guest's status. Australians don't have truck with that sort of thing.Geoffrey Rush, playing the Australian, is excellent - suitable not just on account of his native laconic Strine-ness (if anything the Ocker is dialed back from normal) but also in his flawless comic timing. While there is a rustic solemnity to much of his performance, it is the lighter moments that set it off. The central helix here is the relationship between these two men: both outsiders, both unqualified for their tasks, both of whom would rather be doing something else (in Logue's case, amateur dramatics), but both uniquely positioned by their character to carry out their designated roles.I'm pleased to report Helena Bonham Carter managed to slip her Burtonesque Gothic minders for this outing, and while there is just that hint of darkness about her performance - there always is - what you notice is how plausible a young Queen Mother (as most will remember her) she portrays. Timothy Spall's Churchill is, as you expect, played largely (but reverently) for laughs and Derek Jacobi is the closest we get to a villain (the real villain here is circumstance) as a rather judgmental Archbishop of Canterbury.The talent is, needless to say, from the top shelf of British acting corps, and the pacing and staging of the drama is masterfully done. Flickfeast's Chris Knipp made the excellent observation that this is essentially a sports movie - the genre is overcoming insurmountable odds in the nick of time armed only with a motivational speech - in other clothes. And so it is, but it is so expertly done that you'd be hard hearted indeed not to fall for its charms.I have a sneaking suspicion that I've been manipulated by a good formula weepie, but it was done so cleverly and tactfully that I really don't mind. Essential viewing.Olly Buxton",5,Majestic melodrama,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,5212,"['know', 'film', 'worked', 'when', 'best', 'intentions', 'Not', 'being', 'especially', 'fond', 'historical',

1365219,A15LK8DSFQZZ52,B003UESJH4,"Patricia R. Andersen ""redheaded booklover""","[0, 1]","Unless you have been living under a rock, you know what the movie is about. If you have been living under a rock, here's the short story - king dies, king abdicates, king learns something to enrich his and his country's lives. I was drawn to this movie for a few reasons, one is that I am interested in WWII and also my father was a stutterer.Colin Firth plays  Prince Albert, commonly referred to as ""Bertie"". He has a stutter that prevents him from being able to give public speeches. He tries to avoid it as much as he can and tries to stay out of the spotlight. After all, he is the younger son, his brother, Prince David (Guy Pearce) will become king upon the death of their father, King George V.Bertie's wife, Princess Elizabeth,d played by Helen Bonham Carter, has searched for speech therapists to help her husband. The traditional methods (marbles in the mouth for example) do not help. Each failure makes Bertie more miserable and also more prone to failure.Now, we know that Prince David does ascend to the throne. We also know he abdicates so he can marry his twice divorced love Wallis Simpson. This is a real crisis for Bertie as he never intended and in fact, was never groomed to become king as his brother had been groomed.But Princess Elizabeth manages to find a very intriguing speech therapist from Australia, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). Lionel insists on Bertie coming to Lionel's office and does not show any special consideration because Bertie is a prince. He also expects Bertie to quit smoking, take some exercise and work on the process of learning how not to stutter.Normally Bertie would have been given a pass as he would not have expected to become king. Lionel works on some of the psychological problems that contributed to the stutter - an abusive nanny seems to get the bulk of the blame for Bertie.And finally, of course, according to history and real life, the big test comes. Bertie doesn't have to stand up in front of a classroom and make a speech for 10 minutes to about 30 minutes. He has to make his speech in front of a radio microphone in front of all of England. And he also has to deal with the beginning of WWI.As history shows, King George VI (he took the name from his father) accomplished his goal. He managed to guide England through one of their darkest hours in history. It's very difficult to imagine that his brother or anyone else could have done this journey as well as he had managed to do.All the actors are brilliant, Geoffrey Rush being a special delight.

In ""From Hell"" the detective is Johnny Depp. In ""Murder by Decree"" Chistopher Plummer plays Sherlock Holmes. There was another six part TV series also linking the Royal Family to the Ripper murders. It seems that everyone is willing to believe the absolute worst about the descendents of Victoria and Albert.Victoria and Albert were cousins - first cousins. One of their sons was called The Uncle of Europe because he was related to so many other royals all over Europe.

My, the members of the Academy must have sore shoulders from patting each other on the back for being so tasteful and brave.The story, as everyone knows, is about the fellow who would become King of England shortly before World War II.  He has a stammer, and knowing that he will be required to make public speeches during this difficult time, he enlists the help of someone to overcome this malady.That this premise sounds boring doesn't mean that it has to be, but it is anyway.  There is really no conflict other than that we've seen many times.  In order to resolve his problem the therapist determines that the king must reveal things--certain private things--that the king does not wish to reveal.  Does ""Prince of Tides"" ring a bell?  How about ""Ordinary People?"" Indeed, Geoffrey Rush, who plays the therapist, seems to be channeling Judd Hirsch from that film.The acting isn't too terribly special either.  Colin Firth as the king is okay, but he really isn't required to do anything but stammer occasionally.  Geoffrey Rush plays an Australian with an English accent.  Helena Bonham Carter was quite good playing a gorilla in the Planet of the Ape film, but the future Queen of England?  She mostly succeeds in acting like Helena Bonham Carter with a fancy hat.  The guy who played Winston Churchill was especially bad.  If it were a Saturday Night Live skit it might have been amusing.  Here, it is insipid.Most perplexing is why anyone in Hollywood would deem this film important.  In fact, is there possibly a less controversial subject than Hitler?  Is there anybody on the planet that doesn't believe that Hitler was a very, very bad person?  If someone in Hollywood is looking for a controversial subject, how about Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize winning Chinese dissident who has been jailed four times?  How about the numerous Muslim women fighting for basic fundamental rights in countries such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia?  How about pervasive socialist intervention into Western governments which has led to them to bankruptcy?  Whoa!  Can't have THAT!

He uses a wonderful depth of field and incredible lighting detail to illuminate the locations with an overwhelming sense of space and at the same time a sense of oppression.Prince Albert lives in a world where he is oppressed spiritually and his speech stammering oppresses him physically and psychologically. Tom Hooper uses these elements of the story to enhance our film experience through memorable shots and intense points of view. The rooms and halls in the film are filmed with the same intensity you would film the Rockies or the valleys of the Grand Canyon. In many scenes you will be reminded of Citizen Kane, which has that same visual intensity.

1365228,A2MJ2LPNNQ7LIP,B003UESJH4,Phil Berardelli,"[0, 0]","An English movie but well deserving of Hollywood's highest honor, the title refers to a critical moment in that country's history. In the fall of 1939, negotiations between Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and Adolph Hitler had broken down, and the country found itself at war with Nazi Germany. The people were frightened, and the government was in turmoil. What could be done to bolster the nation for what was coming? The answer: The new king, George VI, needed to rally the citizens of the British Empire with a rousing speech. Except that the king had a problem - a big one: He stuttered, terribly. Actually that's the movie's climax, not its beginning, and what occurs before it represents one of the most unusual friendships ever presented on the screen. George, magnificently portrayed by Colin Firth, seeks out the services of Lionel Logue, a London speech therapist of questionable credentials played with great relish by Geoffrey Rush. Together and painstakingly, Lionel helps Bertie - the king's pet name - to overcome his problem. That's it, but therein lies greatness. The movie is graced with a host of indelible performances, including Michael Gambon as Bertie's father, King George V; Claire Bloom as Queen Mary, his mother; Helena Bonham Carter as his wife, the Duchess of York; Guy Pearce as Edward, his playboy brother, who abdicates his throne to marry his lover from Baltimore, and Jennifer Ehle as Lionel's bemused wife. But the heart of the movie is the priceless interplay between Firth, who deservedly won an Oscar, and Rush, who undeservedly did not. Tom Hooper's direction and David Seidler's script, Oscar-winners both, are flawless, and Danny Cohen's muted cinematography fits the mood perfectly.

1365229,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B003UESJH4,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","While this film changed a bit of its real-life source material for the purpose of artistic license, I feel it captured the spirit of the story just as well as the real events certainly would have.  Stars Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush imediatly shared a chemistry that these two brilliant men then only built upon throughout the rest of the film.  It was nice to see Helena Bonham Carter's Queen Elizabeth not be relegated to the simple role of the lead's wife.  Rather she contributed greatly to the plot and Ms. Carter did this woman justice in every way.  But what I am perhaps happiest about is that Colin Firth's portrayal of King George VI's stammer was never funny or somehow fake-sounding...this man studied and studied to perfect that stammer and his effort shows with every line.  Along those same lines, I enjoyed the realism of Geoffrey Rush's Lionel Logue.  I watched this film for the first time with my girlfriend, who happens to be a speech pathologist.  She said that so many of the methods were accurately portrayed, though she didn't understand the rolling-on-the-floor part (I'm blind and she described it to me, so I hope I'm remembering that right.)  I don't have an answer for that either.

1365231,A2PPJN8OKSXMPT,B003UESJH4,Pippin O' Rohan,"[2, 2]","There is something to be found here for everyone in this brilliant and powerful movie.  Entertaining on all fronts, both dramatic and laced with great humor and irony, it leaves one with a sense of euphoria and triumph.  While comparatively little was known in America about Queen Elizabeth's father before the release of this masterpiece, there has been an on-going interest in her late uncle, the ruling monarch before WWII, who abdicated his throne in favor of the American woman he loved.  His radio speech to England at the time when he removed his crown, and handed it over to his reluctant and ill-prepared younger brother, is perhaps one of the most listened to still today, not only by the British, but other nations as well.  It is a speech that may be consided as having changed the course of history in such a way as to bring Queen Elizabeth to the fore as one of the most important rulers today in modern history.  The pivotal point of the story in this movie lies here with her father, who had a debilitating speech impediment, and was hardly able to make a brief announcement let alone a speech of any kind.  With the tenacious help of his wife, the future Queen Mother, they go together in search throughout the kingdom for royal physicians, who may hold the key to a cure.  This depressing and increasingly ""grim-go-round"" brings them as a last resort, into the office of an unconventional speech therapist, who is regarded as an eccentric crackpot, a nonentity and possibly a fraud.  Or is he?  This is for the viewers to determine.  The first thing this man does is to grab ""royal protocol"" and place it outside his office, solidly parked near the umbrella stand until the office visits are over.  The results are not only hilarious, but appear to be beneficial and involve hard work on both the part of the doctor and the patient as they thrive to become a working team and establish a friendly understanding.  In the midst of this true historical anecdote, the movie shows a dark and frightening contrast to the struggling king in the form of Hitler, a foe who has no trouble speaking whatsoever, using a documentary newsreel at the time showing him rallying the crowds, sending cold chills down some of the viewers backs.  It is now a match between ""Good versus Evil"", and the rest is history.  As for the king's speech, broadcast on the radio and listened to by England and the world-at-large, announcing that Britain is at War with Germany, it is perhaps one of the most intense and powerful ones ever given (On a personal note, this was a great topic for a small international speaking club located at UNICEF House in New York.  After giving a short 5-minute address on the background history of the movie, I highly recommended that everybody would benefit in some way from watching it.  My fellow members are from Africa, Europe, Asia and the Islands and while we are all fluent in English, it can be difficult for us to stand up in front of an audience and ""speak out"" although we are a friendly group, always encouraging and supportive).

1365235,A1FCBJNIFF4PPU,B003UESJH4,prairie woman,"[2, 2]","I could hardly wait for this movie to come out and I was not disappointed.  The DVD was even better because of all of the extra behind the scenes interviews with the actors and director.  The added bonus was examples of children who stuttered and were struggling to overcome that debilitating speech defect.  The story of King George VI is even more heartbreaking because he did come from a privileged environment where you think he would've had more advantages in getting supportive treatment.  The movie shows that it was tried when he was much older and married but the techniques of holding marbles in his mouth, smoking ""to relax the vocal cords"" and finally his father saying to him, ""just do it"" when he's asked to give a broadcasted speech gave him  even greater feelings of anxiety and despair.  When he is trying to speak at an event in the beginning of the movie, I could only imagine what he must've been feeling, much less what the public must have experienced.  It's like Lionel Logue said to him before the coronation, ""I was there that day with my son, and he said to me, ""Can't you please help that poor man?""  Even though Colin Firth doesn't look like George VI, I think he portrayed him very well with the diction and stammering and obviously had studied and done a lot of research.  Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth was just charming in her role as the supportive, encouraging wife.  When Colin Firth was interviewed shortly after the movie came out, he said that the screenwriter, who also had the same condition asked the Queen Mother if he could tell the story about George VI.  The Queen Mother replied, ""Not in my lifetime.  It was too painful."" This movie was inspiring in that it showed how someone could overcome an obstacle and go on to greater moments.  George VI will always be known as the monarch who displayed courage and supported the British people during those dark times during WWII as London was repeatedly bombed.

Albert, Bertie (Colin Firth) is Prince of York, second in line to the British crown and his suave brother, Edward the Prince of Wales is first. Bertie is shy, retiring and a bit priggish and definitely repressed.  Both the King, George V and the Prince of Wales make fun of Bertie for his awful embarrassing stutter. But that's OK, the King is on the throne and the Prince of Wales stands ready to take over the reins of government in the future, and Bertie can stay far in the background, away from the public eye, and ear! Bertie seeks the help of speech therapists, many of them, lastly Lionel Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush.  But wait, Hitler is rising to power and is taking over Europe, the King is deadly sick and the Prince of Wales is a drunken playboy, in love with Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee of dubious character who is also fooling around with various Germans and Edward is a crypto-Fascist, who is in sympathy with Hitler! Rulership of the United Kingdom and stewardship of the Free World during World War II is soon to be thrust on the unlikely shoulders of shy stuttering Bertie. Logue recognizes the psychological origins or Bertie's problem applies unconventional therapies.Helena Bonham Carter plays the role of the woman who would become the current Queen Mother (!)Ultimately, The Kings Speech is a vague kind of buddy movie, but one unlike any other. The roles and sympathy the actors, Firth, Rush and Carter come to share for each other is the hallmark.There was a time when the film industry produced many films each year with the superb quality of acting and meaningful plot in the Kings Speech.

1365243,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B003UESJH4,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[2, 3]","""The King's Speech"" is a riveting picture.  Colin Firth plays a convincing Prince Albert of England years before he would become King of England, but before he can prove to himself worthy of the throne, which viewers will see or already know that his predecessor and brother David would temporarily bring controversy to the family, he must overcome the stammer that has plagued his life since he was four years-old.  And in order to help him to attempt to succeed is his speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush)Director Tom Hooper has produced an enormously moving film that is shown with each scene and the impeccable craftsmanship to take viewers back into a time, period, and place where the importance of presentation appeared to be a all or nothing or all element, especially for those within the hierarchy of society.  But set that element aside and concentrate on the relationship that develops between Albert, also referred to as ""Bertie"" which he snickers at during their first meeting at Lionel's office to establish a less formal rapport.  Gradually Bertie comes to respect Lionel's method of attempting to overcome his speech impediment from listening to music while reading a passage from Shakespeare, singing to ""Camptown Races,"" and even indulging in bit of vulgarity to make his speech flow.  It is those methods that show progress throughout the film, but it is the moving moment where Bertie has to make those important speeches in front of a crowd that are the most dramatic parts of the film.  Hooper is very effective in showing viewers what Bertie may have encountered while standing in front of an audience or even making that monumental speech to the people of England during the opening chapter of England's engagement during World War II.  The scenes are highly emotional and show a man who looked through a lens that almost appeared claustrophobic, daunting, and exhausting.  However, by the end of the film, much applause and accolades go to Hooper's direction and Firth and Rush's presentation of showing the adversity that King George VI would overcome and achieve to be the leader that he had never realized he would become; the rest is history.After watching ""The King's Speech,"" there is no doubt that history indeed never stops being told in its rich and fascinating ways, especially through film.

He stands at the podium, with the speech in hand and his lovely wife by his side. He begins to open his mouth... but the words can't come out. He fights himself to get the words out, but no matter how hard he fights, Prince Albert's- soon to be King George VI- stammer gets the best of him. His wife, Queen Elizabeth, is worried for him. So what does she do? She looks in the paper and follows an ad that leads the two to failed Australian stage actor Lionel Logue, who teaches him how to do his best in the situations where his stammer gets the best of him.The King's Speech is based upon this incredible story, and is really a remarkable film in every aspect. The film, unfortunately, was slapped with an R rating from the MPAA for about 12 occurrences of the F-bomb. It's too bad the MPAA don't know how to take things into context and like to automatically slap an R rating because of one four letter word, even despite the word being used in a non-sexual context. Even young children are taught the swearing trick in speech therapy.The performances in the film are nothing short of incredible- Colin Firth has yet again proved why he is a great actor. He apparently studied stammering to get prepared for the role and I'm not surprised- his stammering was realistic. Helena Bonham Carter gives a sexy and suave performance as Queen Elizabeth, the supportive wife and woman who's at his right hand all along. Geoffrey Rush and Guy Pearce are also incredible, Rush giving a nice and comical performance as Lionel Logue and Peace playing the brother, David.I will admit I was wondering how a movie about a man who stammers could be good, and I can safely say after seeing this movie, it was done in a way it could be entertaining!!!! The therapy scenes are wicked fun and hilarious. The funniest of all being where Bertie is taught the swearing trick, where you can release your stress by unleashing a whole load of cuss words. That scene had the whole theatre laughing out loud and was definitely one of the highlights of the film. However the true highlights was the big speech near the end, where King George VI is faced with the biggest task of his career- a speech on the radio. The whole scene is intense and has you on the edge of your seat- it is every bit as suspenseful as being at a soccer game in the final few minutes and hoping your team can win. I felt like I was one of the many people listening to the speech on the radio. It was effective and you will definitely be on the edge of your seat.In short, I walked out of the theatre with a big smile on my face.

It's certainly not that it's a bad film by any means, but it seems to be quite unlike what the Academy usually favours. It's not dark or gritty, it isn't concerned with hefty themes involving human rights or social justice issues, and it's all about the English monarchy.In essence, it's just one man's struggle to overcome a speech impediment - a man who happens to be the King of England.Based on true events (obviously) the film chronicles the years leading up to WWII in which Prince Albert of York became King George VI after his brother's decision to abdicate the throne so that he might marry American Wallis Simpson. This would be strain enough on any man, but Albert has suffered from a bad stammer since he was a child, making it virtually impossible for him to handle the latest broadcasting technology that requires him to make speeches to the populace.His wife Elizabeth (who we now know best as the Queen Mother) seeks out the assistance of Australian elocutionist Lionel Logue, the latest in a long line of doctors that have been hired to help the prince with his condition.At first Albert is doubtful, particularly with Lionel's unorthodox methods which involve him insisting on equality and addressing the prince by the nickname ""Bertie"". But there is a definite improvement as the result of the tongue-twisters, shouting, swearing, singing and movement exercises, and despite several setbacks and arguments, a friendship between the two men solidifies as Albert finally begins to master his speech.As you might expect, it's full of familiar British faces: Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helen Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Guy Pierce, Timothy Spall, Derek Jacobi, Anthony Andrews, and even Jennifer Ehle . All of the actors involved effortlessly bring their A-game, and Colin Firth in particular well-deserved his Oscar, managing a heart-breaking scene in which he sings of his unhappy childhood without any anger or self-pity; just quiet sadness.Likewise, it's great to see Helen Bonham Carter get away from Tim Burton's eccentricities and play a serious role, and Elizabeth (along with Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, the future queen and her sister) provides a ray of light in what is otherwise a completely stunted and dysfunctional extended family. It's a moving portrayal of a loving marriage, one that's complimented by the warmth of the Logue family.I will say that the pacing is quite slow and that visually it's rather drab. This surprised me, as these types of period films are usually lavish when it comes to costume and scenery porn, but here everything is dismal and grey. Most of the film is set indoors, but even the landscapes are shrouded in mist to conceal any glimpse of a wide open space. I've no doubt that this was a deliberate attempt to capture the stifling atmosphere of Albert's life, so be warned that almost everything is designed and shot to convey a claustrophobic, uncomfortable atmosphere. The exception is Lionel's consultation room, a large and lofty area with windowed ceilings and several layers of mottled, peeling wallpaper that serves as a fascinating backdrop for the actors. It's a beautiful space, and a suitable setting for the majority of the drama.I knew that there were some discrepancies in regard to historical accuracy, but after a quick look at the film's Wikipedia page I came to the conclusion that they're rather superficial and understandable given the medium of film. The timespan of the events is squeezed down and some of Lionel's methods are dubious, but for the most part dramatic licence is kept under control and used to make legitimate dramatic points. It's one of those films in which historians will get a little pernickety, but no one else will really care.Of most interest to me was the fact that Edward and Wallis were rather unsympathetically portrayed, the former as a bullying playboy, the latter as a self-absorbed socialite. This made for an intriguing flip on perspective so soon after watching Madonna'sW.E.in which the couple were the protagonists. More than anything, the films illuminate the divide that exists not between hero and villain, but love and duty, and how each royal brother was affected by both over the course of their lifetimes. These days there is an emphasis on the superiority of romantic love over absolutely anything and everything else on earth, but watching ""The King's Speech"", you can't help but feel that Prince Albert, who put his duty to his country before his personal desire for solitude, was not only the better man, but better off.",5,"""I Have a Voice!""",1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,4660,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'King', 'Speech', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', '2010', 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'means', 'be', 'quite', 'what', 'Academy', 'usually', 'not', 'dark', 'gritty', ""n't"", 'concerned', 'hefty', 'themes', 'involving', 'human', 'rights', 'social', 'justice', 'issues', 'English', 'monarchy.In', 'essence', 'just', 'one', 'man', 'struggle', 'overcome', 'speech', 'impediment', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'King', 'England.Based', 'true', 'events', 'obviously', 'film', 'years', 'leading', 'up', 'WWII', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'York', 'became', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'brother', 'decision', 'abdicate', 'throne', 'so', 'might', 'marry', 'American', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'would', 'be', 'strain', 'enough', 'man', 'Albert', 'suffered', 'bad', 'stammer', 'was', 'child', 'making', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'handle', 'latest', 'broadcasting', 'technology', 'make', 'speeches', 'populace.His', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'now', 'know', 'best', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'out', 'assistance', 'Australian', 'elocutionist', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'latest', 'long', 'line', 'doctors', 'have', 'been', 'hired', 'help', 'prince', 'condition.At', 'first', 'Albert', 'doubtful', 'particularly', 'Lionel', 'unorthodox', 'methods', 'involve', 'insisting', 'equality', 'addressing', 'prince', 'nickname', 'Bertie', 'definite', 'improvement', 'result', 'tongue-twisters', 'shouting', 'swearing', 'singing', 'movement', 'exercises', 'several', 'setbacks', 'arguments', 'friendship', 'two', 'men', 'solidifies', 'Albert', 'finally', 'master', 'speech.As', 'might', 'expect', 'full', 'familiar', 'British', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Helen', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'even', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'actors', 'involved', 'effortlessly', 'bring', 'A-game', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'particular', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'managing', 'heart-breaking', 'scene', 'unhappy', 'childhood', 'anger', 'self-pity', 'just', 'quiet', 'sadness.Likewise', 'great', 'see', 'Helen', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'get', 'away', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'eccentricities', 'play', 'serious', 'role', 'Elizabeth', 'Princesses', 'Elizabeth', 'Margaret', 'future', 'queen', 'sister', 'ray', 'light', 'what', 'otherwise', 'completely', 'stunted', 'dysfunctional', 'extended', 'family', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'loving', 'marriage', 'one', 'complimented', 'warmth', 'Logue', 'family.I', 'will', 'say', 'pacing', 'quite', 'slow', 'visually', 'rather', 'drab', 'surprised', 'types', 'period', 'films', 'are', 'usually', 'lavish', 'when', 'costume', 'scenery', 'porn', 'here', 'everything', 'dismal', 'grey', 'Most', 'film', 'set', 'indoors', 'even', 'landscapes', 'are', 'shrouded', 'mist', 'conceal', 'glimpse', 'wide', 'open', 'space', ""'ve"", 'doubt', 'was', 'deliberate', 'attempt', 'capture', 'stifling', 'atmosphere', 'Albert', 'life', 'so', 'be', 'warned', 'almost', 'everything', 'designed', 'shot', 'convey', 'claustrophobic', 'uncomfortable', 'atmosphere', 'exception', 'Lionel', 'consultation', 'room', 'large', 'lofty', 'area', 'windowed', 'ceilings', 'several', 'layers', 'mottled', 'peeling', 'wallpaper', 'fascinating', 'backdrop', 'actors', 'beautiful', 'space', 'suitable', 'setting', 'majority', 'drama.I', 'knew', 'were', 'discrepancies', 'regard', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'quick', 'look', 'film', 'Wikipedia', 'page', 'came', 'conclusion', ""'re"", 'rather', 'superficial', 'understandable', 'given', 'medium', 'film', 'timespan', 'events', 'squeezed', 'down', 'Lionel', 'methods', 'are', 'dubious', 'most', 'part', 'dramatic', 'licence', 'kept', 'control', 'used', 'make', 'legitimate', 'dramatic', 'points', 'one', 'films', 'historians', 'will', 'get', 'little', 'pernickety', 'one', 'else', 'will', 'really', 'care.Of', 'most', 'interest', 'was', 'fact', 'Edward', 'Wallis', 'were', 'rather', 'unsympathetically', 'portrayed', 'former', 'bullying', 'playboy', 'latter', 'self-absorbed', 'socialite', 'made', 'intriguing', 'flip', 'perspective', 'so', 'soon', 'watching', ""Madonna'sW.E.in"", 'couple', 'were', 'protagonists', 'More', 'anything', 'films', 'illuminate', 'divide', 'not', 'hero', 'villain', 'love', 'duty', 'how', 'royal', 'brother', 'was', 'affected', 'course', 'lifetimes', 'days', 'emphasis', 'superiority', 'romantic', 'love', 'absolutely', 'anything', 'everything', 'else', 'earth', 'watching', 'King', 'Speech', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'who', 'put', 'duty', 'country', 'personal', 'desire', 'solitude', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'better', 'man', 'better', 'off']",N/A
1365252,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B003UESJH4,RMurray847,"[2, 2]","I can enjoy fine movies with minimalist acting.  Where the actors spend a lot of time saying nothing, but looking very serious, or hurt, or angry or whatever.  The kind of the thing that lots of young American actors like to do these days.  Where emotions are bottled up.  This can be very effective.But sometimes, you just want to have a good, old-fashioned wallow in the kind of meaty, no-holds barred acting that, frankly, the British do best.  And the best, most satisfying example of that this year is THE KING'S SPEECH, a terrific, interesting, engrossing and surprisingly emotional film about a monarch who stutters.In the years between the two great wars of the 20th Century, King George V ruled England and its colonies with a stern disposition and unshakeable self-confidence.  His eldest son, Edward, is a dashing playboy type, but looks forward to his time on the throne.  Younger son Albert (""Bertie"") is shyer and more conservative...in large part because he has a rather pronounced stammer that years of consulting experts has done nothing to cure.  He has a strong wife in Elizabeth, and dotes on his daughters Elizabeth and Margaret.  And he has no ambitions to be king.His wife convinces him to start consulting with Speech Therapist Lionel Logue, a commoner with some highly uncomment techniques.  Not only does he work on the mechanics of speech, but he believes that stammers also come from a psychological place as well.  He's a sort of psychologist too.  He works with the prince, insists that two men work on a first name basis, and through sheer force of his eccentric personality, begins to wear the reserved Albert down to the point where we learn much about his upbringing.And then, as WWII nears, George V dies and Edward serves only briefly, because the scandal of his love affair with divorced American Wallace Simpson forces him from the throne...and George is horrified to find himself about to be crowned.  And eventually, George will have to give perhaps the most important nationwide radio address anyone had ever given in England up to that point...a speech rallying his people to the cause of war.  He can ill afford to stammer his way through a speech that needs to inspire confidence and patriotism.It's a fascinating story, utterly engrossing.  But it's the uniformly great acting that elevates this to such a high level.  Small but effective parts are handled by folks such as Michael Gambon (King George V...excellent), Derek Jacobi as the archbishop, Guy Pearce as King Edward (he's quite good) and Jennifer Ehle in a small but delightful role as Logue's wife.  Helena Bonham Carter is more restrained than usual, but also very effective as the Queen.  She clearly dotes on her husband, which makes her very sympathetic, yet she also shows that the trappings and conventions of royalty suit her.  The two appear to be that seeming rarity, a royal couple that are actually happy with each other.  But all this great acting is just icing on the cake for the pure movie-going joy of watching Colin Firth (as King George VI) and Geoffrey Rush (as the uncommon commoner) go toe-to-toe.  Both actors are at their finest.Rush can incline towards the hammy (as in the PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN movies) but when the script matches his natural characteristics (such as the unappreciated QUILLS)...he's just a joy to watch.  His timing is exquisite and his commitment to his work is amazing.  And Firth, though a more ""restrained"" actor, chews into his role with understated ferocity (this seems to make no sense...but see the film and you'll understand).  He makes his Bertie so sympathetic...but rather than just playing a shy stammerer, we see his integrity, his wit, his pain and his explosive temper.  His struggle against the casual attitude Logue takes with him is so much fun to watch, as are the great moments these two have together when they discover how well the King speaks when he is cursing.  The two develop an odd but deeply affecting friendship.  I don't know if the film presents history accurately...but it sure presents history as it would be nice to believe it happened.  Both actors should be slam dunks for Oscar nominations...and Firth will be hard to beat.  It may be his best ""upper class British"" performance to date.The film is a bit manipulative. The climactic moments being heavily punctuated with Beethoven seems a bit heavy handed.  Some of the dialogue is just TOO good to be believed.  But the two actors and their co-stars plow right through any weaknesses or pandering to the audience.  A measure of the success of the film...my 23 year old son and 18 year old daughter loved it.  For a film so far out of my son's comfort zone to grab him to the extent it did says a lot.  This is a film worth seeking out and seeing immediately.",5,Fantastically well acted film & an unforgettable story,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,4799,"['can', 'enjoy', 'fine', 'movies', 'minimalist', 'acting', 'Where', 'actors', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'saying', 'nothing', 'looking', 'very', 'serious', 'hurt', 'angry', 'kind', 'thing', 'lots', 'young', 'American', 'actors', 'do', 'days', 'Where', 'emotions', 'are', 'bottled', 'up', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'effective.But', 'sometimes', 'just', 'want', 'have', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'wallow', 'kind', 'meaty', 'no-holds', 'barred', 'acting', 'frankly', 'British', 'do', 'best', 'best', 'most', 'satisfying', 'example', 'year', 'THE', 'KING', 'SPEECH', 'terrific', 'interesting', 'engrossing', 'surprisingly', 'emotional', 'film', 'monarch', 'who', 'years', 'two', 'great', 'wars', '20th', 'Century', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'ruled', 'England', 'colonies', 'stern', 'disposition', 'unshakeable', 'self-confidence', 'eldest', 'son', 'Edward', 'dashing', 'playboy', 'type', 'forward', 'time', 'throne', 'Younger', 'son', 'Albert', 'Bertie', 'shyer', 'more', 'conservative', 'large', 'part', 'rather', 'pronounced', 'stammer', 'years', 'consulting', 'experts', 'done', 'nothing', 'cure', 'strong', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'daughters', 'Elizabeth', 'Margaret', 'ambitions', 'be', 'king.His', 'wife', 'convinces', 'start', 'consulting', 'Speech', 'Therapist', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'commoner', 'highly', 'uncomment', 'techniques', 'Not', 'only', 'work', 'mechanics', 'speech', 'stammers', 'also', 'come', 'psychological', 'place', 'as', 'well', 'sort', 'psychologist', 'too', 'prince', 'two', 'men', 'work', 'first', 'name', 'basis', 'sheer', 'force', 'eccentric', 'personality', 'wear', 'reserved', 'Albert', 'down', 'point', 'where', 'learn', 'much', 'upbringing.And', 'then', 'WWII', 'George', 'V', 'dies', 'Edward', 'only', 'briefly', 'scandal', 'love', 'affair', 'divorced', 'American', 'Wallace', 'Simpson', 'forces', 'throne', 'George', 'horrified', 'find', 'be', 'crowned', 'eventually', 'George', 'will', 'have', 'give', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'nationwide', 'radio', 'address', 'anyone', 'had', 'ever', 'given', 'England', 'up', 'point', 'speech', 'rallying', 'people', 'cause', 'war', 'can', 'ill', 'afford', 'stammer', 'way', 'speech', 'inspire', 'confidence', 'patriotism.It', 'fascinating', 'story', 'utterly', 'engrossing', 'uniformly', 'great', 'acting', 'such', 'high', 'level', 'Small', 'effective', 'parts', 'are', 'handled', 'folks', 'such', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'excellent', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'archbishop', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'King', 'Edward', 'quite', 'good', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'small', 'delightful', 'role', 'Logue', 'wife', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'more', 'restrained', 'usual', 'also', 'very', 'effective', 'Queen', 'clearly', 'husband', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'yet', 'also', 'trappings', 'conventions', 'royalty', 'suit', 'two', 'appear', 'be', 'seeming', 'rarity', 'royal', 'couple', 'are', 'actually', 'happy', 'other', 'great', 'acting', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'pure', 'movie-going', 'joy', 'watching', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'uncommon', 'commoner', 'go', 'toe-to-toe', 'actors', 'are', 'finest.Rush', 'can', 'incline', 'hammy', 'PIRATES', 'THE', 'CARRIBEAN', 'movies', 'when', 'script', 'natural', 'characteristics', 'such', 'unappreciated', 'QUILLS', 'just', 'joy', 'watch', 'timing', 'exquisite', 'commitment', 'work', 'amazing', 'Firth', 'more', 'restrained', 'actor', 'role', 'understated', 'ferocity', 'make', 'sense', 'see', 'film', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'Bertie', 'so', 'sympathetic', 'rather', 'just', 'playing', 'shy', 'stammerer', 'see', 'integrity', 'wit', 'pain', 'explosive', 'temper', 'struggle', 'casual', 'attitude', 'Logue', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'two', 'have', 'together', 'when', 'discover', 'how', 'well', 'King', 'speaks', 'when', 'cursing', 'two', 'develop', 'odd', 'deeply', 'affecting', 'friendship', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'presents', 'history', 'accurately', 'sure', 'history', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'believe', 'happened', 'actors', 'should', 'be', 'slam', 'dunks', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Firth', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'beat', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'upper', 'class', 'British', 'performance', 'date.The', 'film', 'bit', 'manipulative', 'climactic', 'moments', 'being', 'heavily', 'punctuated', 'Beethoven', 'bit', 'heavy', 'handed', 'dialogue', 'just', 'TOO', 'good', 'be', 'believed', 'two', 'actors', 'co-stars', 'plow', 'right', 'weaknesses', 'pandering', 'audience', 'measure', 'success', 'film', '23', 'year', 'old', 'son', '18', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'loved', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'son', 'comfort', 'zone', 'grab', 'extent', 'did', 'lot', 'film', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out', 'seeing', 'immediately']",N/A

1365254,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003UESJH4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 5]","The King's Speech (Tom Hooper, 2010)You know, I saw this movie way back in January. I had planned to review it the next day, but then I got to thinking about it, and wanted to let it sit. I got avalanched with other stuff, and then it won Best Picture, and I said to myself ""I'll review it tomorrow to take advantage of the Best picture thing."" And you know what? I'm writing this on March 15, 2011, and I haven't yet done anything with it yet. Whoops, missed THAT train. And the thing is, it's not because I'm trying to figure out how to soft-pedal a bad review (I liked it as much as the next guy) or anything like that; I just haven't, to this point, been able to find anything to say about it, really.I first encountered Hooper through a picture that, in some ways, is very similar to this one: Red Dust, a 2004 historical drama also based on a true story (and Hooper's ""based on a true story"" actually says what it means in both cases, which is praiseworthy). The story itself is very different, but Hooper's method of constructing a film around it is spot-on. Both films are imepccably-acted, very well crafted from a cinematography standpoint (and with gorgeous set pieces, utilizing cinematographers and DPs who play to the strengths of the settings, rural South Africa for Red Dust and urban London for The King's Speech), expertly-paced, and left me feeling good about the world when I finished watching them.But you know what? A month after seeing Red Dust, I didn't remember a great deal about it. I had certainly forgotten Hooper directed it until I looked him up on IMDB. And here we are a couple of months after The King's Speech, and I remember a bit more. Oddly, that has less to do with either Colin Firth (very good performance, of course, but he's always that good) or Helena Bonham-Carter (was she really even in the movie enough to land a Best Supporting nom?  I grant you, one could say the same about Beatrice Straight in Network, but I will remember Straight's eight minutes long after Bonham-Carter's turn here has faded from my memory; she was much better in Fight Club, for example), but Geoffrey Rush. Unlike either Firth or Bonham-Carter, Rush is a very inconsistent chap, who makes both good and bad movie choices and turns in good and bad performances, and the two have no direct connection (excellent in Quills, the only thing worth watching in Intolerable Cruelty, and what the hell were you thinking appearing in The House on Haunted Hill at all?). So when everything really comes together for Mr. Rush, I sit up and take notice. Other favorites of mine pop up (the underutilized Timothy Spall, Guy Pearce, Anthony Andrews, a host of others) as well, but I'd half-forgotten they were there at all.Thus the danger of writing a movie review right after seeing the movie, something I occasionally do (but I usually let them stew for anywhere from a couple of weeks to almost a year); how you feel right after walking out of the theater and how you feel a week or a month later about the same film could very well be entirely different things. Think of it, oversimplifying things, as the difference between short-term and long-term memory; what you remember about a movie a month after you've seen it may well be very different than what you remember about it five minutes after the movie is over. I recently saw Night of the Creeps, one of the eighties' best horror-comedies, on the big screen for the first time in a quarter-century. We all cheered at bits we (probably, anyway, hard to remember that far back) didn't cheer at the first time, simply because what drew us to the film in the first place--its spoofing on The Blob, not to mention its skewering of fraternity and sorority life--took second place in our minds over the years to the cleverness of the script, the freshness of the acting, the excellent comic timing. (The entire audience called out the ""Detective... thrill me."" line at the end. The entire audience.)All of which is just a rather long-winded way of saying that reviewing this two months later I'm remembering much different things about the movie than I would have been calling out the morning after, save Rush's performance, passed over for an Oscar, in my opinion, because compared to many of the film's other performances it's positively subtle. (One can never say such a thing about Christian Bale, who actually won the statue, or a number of the other actors in the film. Michael Gambon wielded quite the heavy hand here, though one assumes that was intentional, as did Derek Jacobi, Spall [whose Churchill caricature was almost as heavy as Meryl Streep's of Julia Child last year], and, oddly, Guy Pearce, who seemed coated in honey for most of the film.) I rush to add I'm not saying anyone here did a bad job; all the performances contributed a great deal to the overall comic feel, which is quite a relief in a Royal Family biopic, and I wouldn't have traded that for the world. The occasional sour note was almost certainly by design; how else to explain Eve Best's almost lizard-like Wallis Simpson, a woman the Brits still loathe all these years later, while Americans write romantic doorstop-sized biographies of her? (My mother collected them.)I'm sure you've noticed I've concentrated on the acting here, rather than going into the usual stuff I go into, and that's because it's rare that I see a film with such a hefty stable of actors that you can conceivably place Derek Jacobi seventh in a cast list and get away with it. Tom Hooper was certainly up to the task, despite every other major award he's been nominated for over the years having come from his TV work (mostly the John Adams miniseries and Prime Suspect 6, and one wonders idly if the latter occurred only because he managed to pull the fat of a once-brilliant series out of the fires that were the fourth and fifth installments); he's finally got his head around filmwork being different than television work, one of the things that bugged me about Red Dust back in the day. Hiring Danny Cohen as DP was a brilliant move indeed; I imagine Royal-watchers who knew the name were shocked. Remember that gritty-London thing I was talking about? Cohen has been DP on such excellent, and overlooked, lower-class Londond pics as Dead Man's Shoes and This Is England, which are about as far from the highbrow Royal biopic as one can get without going to Australia. One of the things that still strikes me about the film two months later is the griminess of the street where Lionel Logue keeps his offices. Back in the day, we all praised Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 for having the bits set in a makeshift hospital actually look dirty, which so few movies at the time refused to do. It's getting more common these days, but you still don't expect muck in a big-budget studio production when it's not really germane to the plot. Danny Cohen is rapidly becoming my favorite DP who didn't come from Australia.Good god, there's so much to write about this movie. I didn't know where to begin, which was a good part of my not starting this for so long, and now I've no idea where to stop. There are reams to be written on some of the other technical details (the sound is exquisite, and deserved just as much recognition for its subtle retro touches as did the costuming, but for some reason the press focused on the costuming Oscar nom and ignored the sound mixing Oscar nom). One could easily write as many column inches about Guy Pearce's performance as have been written about Colin Firth's. Timothy Spall continues to be ignored in the press, despite having quietly amassed a resume as deep as it is broad, both in huge productions (the Harry Potter franchise) and minuscule ones (my favorite performance of his is still as the investigator in The Wisdom of Crocodiles). Seidler's perfect script, certainly the best one he's turned in since Tucker twenty-two years previous. And yet despite there being all this to write about it, still, two months later, it doesn't feel as weighty, or as ""important"" if you will (as much as I loathe the term in this context) as Black Swan, which I saw the week previous and remember far more of, or some of the groundbreaking Oskar Fischinger shorts I had a chance to see the weekend previously. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film a great deal, but I'm wondering if, twenty-five years from now, we'll be looking at The King's Speech as one of the stronger Best Picture winners or one of the weaker ones. (This is not an idle question. Out of Africa won Best Picture twenty-five years previously. Has anyone watched it in the last twenty?) *** 1/2",4,A review two months later.,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,8612,"['King', 'Speech', 'Tom', 'Hooper', '2010', 'know', 'saw', 'movie', 'way', 'back',

1365259,AE31M52VLKOG6,B003UESJH4,Robert G Yokoyama,"[1, 2]","The King's Speech is easily one of the best movies I have seen this year.  It is the true story of how Duke of York overcomes his stammering problem with the help of a speech therapist named Lionel Logue.  Colin Firth portrays  Bertie, also known as the Duke of York.  He becomes King George VI after his older brother is not fit to be the king of England. Geoffrey Rush plays Logue.  Both men give Oscar worthy performances.  The film is set in England in the mid to late 1930s.  These are years leading up to World War II.The heart of the movie is how the relationship between the Bertie and Lionel Logue develop during the movie.  Bertie is apprehensive of Logue's ability to help him with his sppech problem at first.  Much of the humor of the film lies in the methods that Logue uses to help Bertie to overcome his stammering problems.  He encourages Bertie to sing songs and recite tougue twisters to improve the fluency in his speech. This film shows the personal struggle of a British monarch that I knew nothing about.Michael Gambon costars Bertie's father King George V.  England is in need of a king that can inspire confidence in  people.  Michael Gambon conveys this well in the few scenes that he appears in  He is an actor with a strong on screen presence.  Helena Bonham Carter is also very good as Bertie's supportive wife Elizabeth.The music adds so much to the film.  French composer scores the film and provides the movie.  I listened to the soundtrack after I watched the movie.  My favorite music  in the film is a piece entitled the Rehearsal.  The piano playing is beautiful.  This track is light and breezy.  There are also somber instrumental pieces of music in the movie as well. This film includes uplifting classical pieces like Beethoven's Emperor concerto that I love.The King's Speech is an excellent film.  It contains very funny moments between the two stars of the movie.  It is also superbly scored by composer Alexandre Desplant.  It shows the personal struggles of a British monarch not too many people in America know about.  The King's speech proves that biopics can be entertaining and humorous.",5,The King's Speech is one of the best films I have seen this year.,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,2136,"['King', 'Speech', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'true', 'story', 'how', 'Duke', 'York', 'stammering', 'problem', 'help', 'speech', 'therapist', 'named', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Bertie', 'also', 'known', 'Duke', 'York', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'older', 'brother', 'not', 'fit', 'be', 'king', 'England', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Logue', 'men', 'give', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performances', 'film', 'set', 'England', 'mid', 'late', '1930s', 'are', 'years', 'leading', 'up', 'World', 'War', 'II.The', 'heart', 'movie', 'how', 'relationship', 'Bertie', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'develop', 'movie', 'Bertie', 'apprehensive', 'Logue', 'ability', 'help', 'sppech', 'problem', 'first', 'Much', 'humor', 'film', 'methods', 'Logue', 'help', 'Bertie', 'overcome', 'stammering', 'problems', 'Bertie', 'sing', 'songs', 'recite', 'tougue', 'twisters', 'improve', 'fluency', 'speech', 'film', 'personal', 'struggle', 'British', 'monarch', 'knew', 'nothing', 'about.Michael', 'Gambon', 'Bertie', 'father', 'King', 'George', 'V.', 'England', 'need', 'king', 'can', 'inspire', 'confidence', 'people', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'conveys', 'well', 'few', 'scenes', 'actor', 'strong', 'screen', 'presence', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Bertie', 'supportive', 'wife', 'Elizabeth.The', 'music', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'French', 'composer', 'film', 'movie', 'listened', 'soundtrack', 'watched', 'movie', 'favorite', 'music', 'film', 'piece', 'entitled', 'Rehearsal', 'piano', 'playing', 'beautiful', 'track', 'light', 'breezy', 'are', 'also', 'somber', 'instrumental', 'pieces', 'music', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'uplifting', 'classical', 'pieces', 'Beethoven', 'Emperor', 'concerto', 'love.The', 'King', 'Speech', 'excellent', 'film', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'two', 'stars', 'movie', 'also', 'superbly', 'scored', 'composer', 'Alexandre', 'Desplant', 'personal', 'struggles', 'British', 'monarch', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'America', 'know', 'King', 'speech', 'biopics', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'humorous']",N/A

I know I've always wondered what went onto behind the scenes in the lives of royalty and the King's Speech gives us a wonderful view. It's said in legends that a wounded hero is the only one who can save us, and that's exactly what happened during WWII with King George IV, or Bertie as his family called him, and Lionel Logue, a speech therapist.The King's Speech: Road to the Throne, tells the story of King George the IV, who must take over the throne because Edward VIII wants to marry Wallas Simpson, which would render him ineligible to rule. Considering how courageous Bertie was in first overcoming his stuttering, and then going on to lead England through a vicious war, I think Wallas did the English people a favor. From what I saw of the movie, Edward appeared to a mean-spirited man, more interested in his creature comforts than anything else. One might speculate that he uses his infatuation with Wallas to get out of doing the work of being a king.This is the story of the friendship between two men, and how a fraud saved a country. Lionel didn't have the degree it was assumed he had, but to his credit, he never claimed to be a doctor. What he did claim was that he could help Bertie and he did. Lionel probably gave Bertie the first unconditional he'd ever had in his life. I don't begin to know what might cause stuttering, but I do know that Edward's constant teasing of his little brother's affliction couldn't have made it any better.The movie shows us what it was like for Bertie as a man, to be afflicted with the one thing that he can't have, if he wants to give courage to his nation during war times. Lionel gives Bertie the courage to reach beyond his fear, and to rise up in order to save his nation, to show the most important role a ruler must live, and that's to give his people a role model when they've lost heart.As a movie, both the role of Bertie, played by Colin Firth, and the role of Lionel, played by Geoffry Rush, are played superbly. Firth brings such a vulnerability to Bertie, that to see him rise up to meet his challenges is wonderful. Rush plays Lionel with just the right combination of dignity and playfulness, skillfully walking the edge of innate brilliance and madness.It took me a while to see this movie because, frankly a story about a king with a stutter than the guy that fixes him, sounds boring the extreme. I'm so glad I took the time to watch it, and really only because of the awards and great reviews it received. It's a movie that stay with me for a long time.",5,Great Movie,1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,2552,"['What', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'know', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'went', 'scenes', 'lives', 'royalty', 'King', 'Speech', 'wonderful', 'view', 'said', 'legends', 'wounded', 'hero', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'save', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'WWII', 'King', 'George', 'IV', 'Bertie', 'family', 'called', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'speech', 'therapist.The', 'King', 'Speech', 'Road', 'Throne', 'story', 'King', 'George', 'IV', 'who', 'must', 'take', 'over', 'throne', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'marry', 'Wallas', 'Simpson', 'would', 'render', 'ineligible', 'rule', 'Considering', 'how', 'courageous', 'Bertie', 'was', 'first', 'overcoming', 'stuttering', 'then', 'going', 'lead', 'England', 'vicious', 'war', 'think', 'Wallas', 'did', 'English', 'people', 'favor', 'what', 'saw', 'movie', 'Edward', 'appeared', 'mean-spirited', 'man', 'more', 'interested', 'creature', 'comforts', 'anything', 'else', 'One', 'might', 'speculate', 'infatuation', 'Wallas', 'get', 'doing', 'work', 'being', 'king.This', 'story', 'friendship', 'two', 'men', 'how', 'fraud', 'saved', 'country', 'Lionel', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'degree', 'was', 'assumed', 'had', 'credit', 'never', 'claimed', 'be', 'doctor', 'What', 'did', 'claim', 'was', 'could', 'help', 'Bertie', 'did', 'Lionel', 'probably', 'gave', 'Bertie', 'first', 'unconditional', ""'d"", 'ever', 'had', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'begin', 'know', 'what', 'might', 'cause', 'stuttering', 'do', 'know', 'Edward', 'constant', 'teasing', 'little', 'brother', 'affliction', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'better.The', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'Bertie', 'man', 'be', 'afflicted', 'one', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'give', 'courage', 'nation', 'war', 'times', 'Lionel', 'Bertie', 'courage', 'reach', 'fear', 'rise', 'up', 'order', 'save', 'nation', 'show', 'most', 'important', 'role', 'ruler', 'must', 'live', 'give', 'people', 'role', 'model', 'when', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'movie', 'role', 'Bertie', 'played', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'role', 'Lionel', 'played', 'Geoffry', 'Rush', 'are', 'played', 'superbly', 'Firth', 'brings', 'such', 'vulnerability', 'Bertie', 'see', 'rise', 'up', 'meet', 'challenges', 'wonderful', 'Rush', 'Lionel', 'just', 'right', 'combination', 'dignity', 'playfulness', 'skillfully', 'walking', 'edge', 'innate', 'brilliance', 'madness.It', 'took', 'while', 'see', 'movie', 'frankly', 'story', 'king', 'stutter', 'guy', 'boring', 'extreme', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'took', 'time', 'watch', 'really', 'only', 'awards', 'great', 'reviews', 'received', 'movie', 'stay', 'long', 'time']",N/A
1365263,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B003UESJH4,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","****1/2Earning Oscars for itself as well as for its star, Colin Firth, ""The King's Speech"" is an entertaining historical drama whose intelligent writing and superb acting allow it to triumph over its conventional theme.In this real-life version of ""Pygmalion,"" Firth plays Prince Albert (aka the Duke of York, aka King George VI), the British royal whose severe speech impediment haunted him throughout his early life and made being a monarch difficult in a time when a new little device called radio made speaking in public a necessity for anyone serious about being a respected leader on the world stage.  Geoffrey Rush costars as Lionel Logue, the unlicensed speech therapist and part time stage actor who helped him overcome his affliction.Written by David Seidler (who himself suffered from a stammer as a child) and directed by Tom Hooper, ""The King's Speech"" is very much in the mold of all those fusty, do-gooding, inspirational biographies that always seem to grab the lion's-share of trophies when awards season comes around.  However, this particular one avoids some of the pitfalls of the genre by being less about the physical affliction and more about the psychological issues underlying that affliction.  Indeed, in their numerous sessions together, Lionel turns out to be more psychotherapist than speech coach for a man who - due to his position as a member of a tightly circumscribed and stiff-upper-lipped monarchy - has no one but this comparative stranger to confide his innermost thoughts and feelings to.  Clearly wise in the ways of human nature, Lionel rightly determines that Albert's affliction has less to do with any kind of physical ailment than with his bottled-up feelings towards his father, the unforgiving taskmaster King George V, and his older brother, Edward, Prince of Wales, whose own dalliance with a divorced American commoner leads him to abdicate the throne after only a short period, thereby clearing the way for Albert to assume his rightful place as England's king.  Lionel determines that, more than anything else, it's fear - of humiliating himself in public, of failing to live up to the standards set by a demanding and uncompromising father, of not being able to fulfill the duties his royal birth has thrust upon him - that is the real underlying cause of Albert's problem.  And Lionel, commoner though he may be, isn't shy about confronting the king with some frank truths about himself when he deems it necessary.  He even insists on addressing his royal pupil as ""Bertie,"" the nickname only his immediate family could previously use.  And, of course, the stuttering itself becomes a part of a vicious, self-perpetuating cycle, as it continually eats away at not only Albert's image of himself as a man but his confidence as the individual who's just been handed the heavy burden of leading a beleaguered and frightened nation through the perilous days of World War II.Firth and Rush are both magnificent in their roles, establishing an amazing chemistry between them, as the royal and the commoner brush aside the arbitrary distinctions of division and class to meet on the ground of their common humanity.  Firth never overplays the stuttering, and the expressions of pain and frustration that periodically flit across his face when he's trying so desperately to be understood make us empathize with his predicament entirely.  Likewise, Rush has never seemed more relaxed and confident than he does here, providing a perfect foil for the king's faltering self-confidence.  In lesser hands, the role of Lionel could easily have degenerated into low comedy buffoonery, but Rush never gives in to the temptation, giving us instead a richly shaded and thoughtfully understated portrayal of the character.There is fine work too by Helena Bonham Carter as Albert's devoted and supportive wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York; an English-accented Guy Pearce as Edward, Prince of Wales; Derek Jacobi as the Archbishop of Canterbury; Anthony Andrews as Stanley Baldwin, and Claire Bloom as Albert's mother, Queen Mary.But the film is Firth's and Rush's all the way.",4,a treasure-trove of great performances,1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,4109,"['****1/2Earning', 'Oscars', 'as', 'well', 'star', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'King', 'Speech', 'entertaining', 'historical', 'drama', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'superb', 'acting', 'allow', 'triumph', 'over', 'conventional', 'theme.In', 'real-life', 'version', 'Pygmalion', 'Firth', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'Duke', 'York', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'British', 'royal', 'severe', 'speech', 'impediment', 'haunted', 'early', 'life', 'made', 'being', 'monarch', 'difficult', 'time', 'when', 'new', 'little', 'device', 'called', 'radio', 'made', 'speaking', 'public', 'necessity', 'anyone', 'serious', 'being', 'respected', 'leader', 'world', 'stage', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'unlicensed', 'speech', 'therapist', 'part', 'time', 'stage', 'actor', 'who', 'helped', 'overcome', 'affliction.Written', 'David', 'Seidler', 'who', 'suffered', 'stammer', 'child', 'directed', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'King', 'Speech', 'very', 'much', 'mold', 'fusty', 'do-gooding', 'inspirational', 'biographies', 'always', 'seem', 'grab', ""lion's-share"", 'trophies', 'when', 'awards', 'season', 'around', 'However', 'particular', 'one', 'pitfalls', 'genre', 'being', 'less', 'physical', 'affliction', 'more', 'psychological', 'issues', 'underlying', 'affliction', 'Indeed', 'numerous', 'sessions', 'together', 'Lionel', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'psychotherapist', 'speech', 'coach', 'man', 'who', 'due', 'position', 'member', 'tightly', 'circumscribed', 'stiff-upper-lipped', 'monarchy', 'one', 'comparative', 'stranger', 'confide', 'innermost', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'Clearly', 'wise', 'ways', 'human', 'nature', 'Lionel', 'rightly', 'Albert', 'affliction', 'less', 'do', 'kind', 'physical', 'ailment', 'bottled-up', 'feelings', 'father', 'unforgiving', 'taskmaster', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'older', 'brother', 'Edward', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'own', 'dalliance', 'divorced', 'American', 'commoner', 'abdicate', 'throne', 'only', 'short', 'period', 'thereby', 'clearing', 'way', 'Albert', 'assume', 'rightful', 'place', 'England', 'king', 'Lionel', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'fear', 'humiliating', 'public', 'failing', 'live', 'up', 'standards', 'set', 'demanding', 'uncompromising', 'father', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'fulfill', 'duties', 'royal', 'birth', 'thrust', 'real', 'underlying', 'cause', 'Albert', 'problem', 'Lionel', 'commoner', 'may', 'be', ""n't"", 'shy', 'confronting', 'king', 'frank', 'truths', 'when', 'necessary', 'even', 'addressing', 'royal', 'pupil', 'Bertie', 'nickname', 'only', 'immediate', 'family', 'could', 'previously', 'use', 'course', 'stuttering', 'part', 'vicious', 'self-perpetuating', 'cycle', 'continually', 'away', 'not', 'only', 'Albert', 'image', 'man', 'confidence', 'individual', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'handed', 'heavy', 'burden', 'leading', 'beleaguered', 'frightened', 'nation', 'perilous', 'days', 'World', 'War', 'II.Firth', 'Rush', 'are', 'magnificent', 'roles', 'establishing', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'royal', 'commoner', 'brush', 'aside', 'arbitrary', 'distinctions', 'division', 'class', 'meet', 'ground', 'common', 'humanity', 'Firth', 'never', 'stuttering', 'expressions', 'pain', 'frustration', 'periodically', 'face', 'when', 'trying', 'so', 'desperately', 'be', 'understood', 'make', 'empathize', 'predicament', 'entirely', 'Likewise', 'Rush', 'never', 'seemed', 'more', 'relaxed', 'confident', 'here', 'providing', 'perfect', 'foil', 'king', 'faltering', 'self-confidence', 'lesser', 'hands', 'role', 'Lionel', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'degenerated', 'low', 'comedy', 'buffoonery', 'Rush', 'never', 'temptation', 'giving', 'instead', 'richly', 'shaded', 'thoughtfully', 'understated', 'portrayal', 'character.There', 'fine', 'work', 'too', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Albert', 'devoted', 'supportive', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Duchess', 'York', 'English-accented', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Edward', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Archbishop', 'Canterbury', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'Stanley', 'Baldwin', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'Albert', 'mother', 'Queen', 'Mary.But', 'film', 'Firth', 'Rush', 'way']",N/A

It shows how he and his elocution instructor have to overcome the barriers of position and class to provide a modicum of relief for a King who is expected to give soul-stirring speaches during the depths of WWII.Significant undercurrents are the stresses laid upon the person who will be King and the possible consequences of abdication.  The Duke of York's older brother--the man upon whom Kingship should fall--abdicates the throne for the 'woman I love'--Wallace Simpson, an American divorcee.  This film suggests that this abdication is not just about the intensity of 'love' but also an abdication of personal responsibility.  George VI, despite his fears and limitations, doesn't bow to his fears.  He proves himself something of a hero.Did it heavily influence the history of the world?  Maybe.  The man who would be King--the lover of Wallace Simpson--was also strongly pro-German.

To me, it was just another BBC or Masterpiece Theater production.  It was OK but nothing special.  What was so great about watching a man trying to overcome his speech impediment because that's basically what this film was all about.  Some critics may have thrown in social class differences, development of a friendship--yadda, yadda, yadda.  BUT IT WAS STILL A FILM ABOUT A MAN TRYING TO OVERCOME HIS SPEECH IMPEDIMENT.  THE KING'S SPEECH would've been a much better film if it developed the characters more--especially King George V.  After seeing the film, I still don't really know who he was.  Most people stutter due to a lack of self-confidence.  That's probably why Bertie didn't stammer when he got upset and started yelling at Lioenl--he was filled with self-confidence in those instances.  So why was he lacking self-confidence?  This was never addressed in the film.  Did something happen to him as a kid?  Didn't he get enough love and attention from his parents?  Is he just an overly sensitive kid?  I would've liked to have known more instead of watching and listening to the repetitive therapist/patient sessions.  I really think THE KING'S SPEECH is overrated.

However the relationship between the eventual King George VI and his speech therapist wasn't always portrayed as quite the inspiring friendship that some people considered it to be. The relationship had its rocky times of course, as all relationships do. But over and above that, the two men were portrayed as spending an inordinate amount of time insisting on terms of address. ""Call me `Your Majesty.'"" ""I'll call you Bertie; you call me 'Mr. Logue.'"" ""No, I'll call you 'Lionel'; you call me `Your Highness.'"" And so the film went, having the two men signal their relative preferred status to each other in what seemed like a repeated chorus of Paul Simon's ""You Can Call Me Al.""Even the Queen Mother got in on the act by telling Logue's family how to address her, including a tip on proper pronunciation. All this emphasis on terms and titles seems to needlessly postpone any true friendship.There's also the on-going distraction of the room in which Logue privately coaches the King. There's a peeling wall that dominates the room, showing the layers of decorating history that the wall has suffered. In the commentary included on this disc, the Director gloats about what a coup he scored finding this house with its distinctively deteriorating wall. He points out how framing actor Colin Firth against this wall captured his King character's frazzled, frightened, alienated state as he struggled to overcome his stammering.Yes, that wall did make a striking visual backdrop. But it's hard to believe that the real therapist Logue would have had that kind of ruins-of-Berlin wall in his home office. So I was continuously distracted from the serious unfolding of this little-known piece of history/biography, wondering, ""Would Logue really have conducted business in such a bizarre work space, and would the future King of England really have been so accepting of such oddly beleaguered surroundings?""However these are minor faults with what is overall a classically good film, a film that reminded me of the best of ""Masterpiece Theater"" treatments. What's more, there are many interesting extras on this DVD, including recorded excerpts of the real King George VI delivering his maiden speech with his hard-won fluency.

For the sake of all who hold themselves unconvinced, and because of the order of this piece, it is unthinkable that I should refuse to next provide specifics.It is to the swearing scene that I now call your attention and your open mind, for this dichotomy makes the film great.I ask you to see humor and drama combined in this single moment.The task is not hard.

1365273,A6FIAB28IS79,B003UESJH4,Samuel Chell,"[1, 1]","That 4-word sentence is the spine-tingling climax of the movie, a quote that's in some respects the equivalent of Terry Malloy's finding his own voice in the famous cab scene from ""On the Waterfront"": ""I could have been a contender instead of a lousy bum, which is what I am.""  Of course, the words alone betray the surface meaning and ensure that we see through them to the person (Marlon Brando) who now emerges as a true champion, like King George VI ready to right the wrongs done him by his older brother (Rod Steiger) and set right the injustices of both his personal past and a perilous present.Both statements in both movies occur under the most intimate circumstances, the words escaping the person who utters them to his surprise and only one listener.  When they are subsequently ""validated"" in public at the end of both movies, the acts are admittedly anticlimactic but not overly so.  The King's final action is at once spoken as personally as to one friend (his speech therapist) and his many new friends (the British nation); Brando's final action is on behalf of his murdered brother and his fellow waterfront workers.  His final ""bout"" (with Lee J.

I was surprised because usually these historic dramas tend to be dry & boring with only a history aficionado really appreciating the time period shown or the characters being presented, whether in good light or bad.The film does not concentrate on the whole of history or England's errors and falling into war against Germany and I'm glad it does not.  That's been done.  It's a story of a reluctant prince and later, a reluctant king who through good luck or bad, and thanks to the support of his sympathetic wife, comes upon an Australian speech therapist.Except this speech therapist has been trained in the ""school of hard knocks"" during the First World War.  His techniques are unusual and usually very effective.  His most effective method is to make friends with his patient.  But how do you make friends with a monarch?Film Style:If you've any training at all in film technique, you will be amazed at the tension drawn with angles, cuts and positioning.  ""Bertie"" (the prince) is almost always presented in the lower left of the screen and Logue is almost always placed at the right, in an unusual display that draws the eye to a corner of the screen.  This is a visual representation of the tension between the two characters which is quite amazing and not a technique you normally see in modern films, as you would in the old Hollywood films.  It was refreshing to see.Plots!The subplots are all suppressed in favor of the story between reluctant friends as they struggle to cure the prince of his speech impediment, made more urgent by the fact that the prince's brother is abdicating the throne to marry a woman (quite the scandal at the time) and the prince, now king, needs to be able to speak well as the country falls into war with Germany.And let's not forget the music!  The classic greats of Beethoven, Mozart and Brahms are prominent.  Great soundtrack!The emotions run high at times which I found refreshing.  The ""R"" rating for vulgar language is undeserved and prevents younger teenagers from enjoying this film -- language they hear in the schoolyard all the time!Bottom Line:An unusual presentation of an unusual time in English and Western history.  The struggle between friends is reflected in England's struggle against Hitler's march across Europe.The newsreel of Hitler's speech is unnerving and you can see the man's power.  The prince's daughter turns to her father and says ""What is he saying, Daddy?""  The prince says, ""I don't know, but it says it rather well.""  The king needs to say something just as ""well"" to rally the country.  Can he do it?  And with the help of an untrained Australian speech therapist and failed actor?  Quite a story!Cast & Crew:* Colin Firth - King George VI* Geoffrey Rush - Lionel Logue* Helena Bonham Carter - Queen Elizabeth* Guy Pearce - King Edward VIII* Timothy Spall - Winston Churchill* Derek Jacobi - Archbishop Cosmo Lang* Jennifer Ehle - Myrtle Logue* Michael Gambon - King George V* Tom Hooper - Director* Emile Sherman - Producer",5,"""I Have a Voice!""

1365282,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B003UESJH4,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 4]","The idea of kingship depends on the notion that the king surpasses the limitations God has foisted on the rest of us -- God has chosen this man to lead an entire nation, after all. Tom Hooper's ""The King's Speech,"" winner of last year's Best Picture Oscar, turns this idea on its head by showing us a king who desperately wishes to be an everyman, but by fighting to do his duty becomes all the more heroic.It's the late 1930s, and Prince ""Bertie"" Albert (Colin Firth) reluctantly skulks around the periphery of the royal family thanks to a horrible stammer. Consider the cosmic injustice of it all; not only do people (wrongly) equate stammering with idiocy, Bertie is condemned to lead England -- land of Shakespeare -- during the advent of the radio. No longer could a monarch lead by posing for a portrait astride a noble steed: public speaking was mandatory.Cruel fate conspired to thrust Bertie onto the global stage when his elder brother Edward (Guy Pearce) shockingly abdicated the throne to marry an American divorcee just about the time Hitler decided to unleash his insanity upon the world. All in all, it's fair to say that for a royal, Bertie couldn't catch a break.That is, until his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) locates an unorthodox speech therapist. Although his clientele consists of supremely ordinary folks and, even worse, he's Australian, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) knows his stuff, including the difficult truth that stammering often stems not from mental defects but from emotional damage. Logue learns that for a man born with every seeming advantage Bertie has endured much.The relationship between these two men forms the heart of this movie, and it is riveting. Firth, who received the Oscar for Best Actor, embodies the man who hates to talk but is condemned to speak to the nation as it spins toward WWII. Bertie's flaw is so universal (who hasn't been terrified to speak in public?) and he faces it with such courage that you just can't help rooting for the guy. Rush, on the other hand, breathes new life into the clich&eacute;d unconventional teacher role.Gorgeously shot by Danny Cohen, ""The King's Speech"" is stand-up-and-cheer moviemaking.

1365284,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B003UESJH4,Sean Curley,"[3, 3]","The King-Emperor George VI (of the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, India, et al.) was frequently overshadowed in his life, and he has been mostly overshadowed in history ever since his death, by turns by the memories of his father George V, his brother Edward VIII, and his daughter Elizabeth II, our current sovereign (as well as by his most famous prime minister, Sir Winston Churchill).  He reigned for a tumultous 16 years in the middle of the 20th century, which saw profound changes in Britain, the Commonwealth, and the Empire.  But his fairly low-key personality has kept him mostly unknown to those not interested in the history of the British Crown.  Until this film, that is.  ""The King's Speech"" puts George VI front-and-centre in the popcultural eye, and does so with considerable aplomb.  It is a superb entry in the period film genre, which is often negatively termed ""Oscar bait"".  Spoilers follow.Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George, Duke of York (Colin Firth, in a performance that will win him the Oscar, deservedly), is the second of King George V's (Michael Gambon, one of a number of ""Harry Potter"" alums putting in an appearance) six children.  He has a serious speech impediment that keeps him from successfully carrying out public speaking engagements, to his considerable consternation.  All attempts to work through this affliction seem to fail, but his wife Elizabeth, the Duchess of York (Helena Bonham Carter, sublime fun in a supporting role), keeps looking.  She eventually comes across Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush, dialling it way down from his normal mode to great effect), an Australian speech therapist (and failed actor) known for being a bit unorthodox in his approach.  As you would expect, what Logue has on offer is just the ticket.  And good thing, too, as Albert's feckless older brother David/Edward VIII (Guy Pearce, having good fun, though it's hard to buy him as Colin Firth's older brother) makes a royal botch of things shortly after ascending the throne.  Now King George VI (due, not to the movie's suggestion of the Germanic connotations of Albert, but an obscure bit of royal naming politics dating back to Victoria's husband Albert), public speaking is a matter of real national importance, particularly with World War II on the horizon.Colin Firth is superb as George VI.  His performance as George Falconer in last year's ""A Single Man"" was justly acclaimed, and here, as a different George, he does himself one better.  He invests the character with incredible physical language; stammers are difficult to portray without crossing into caricature, which would be deadly here (and has in the past created an undeserved sense of humour about a serious psychological problem).  In middle age, Firth is emerging as one of the best dramatic actors currently working.  Geoffrey Rush, acting opposite Firth, is almost as good, and surprisingly shies away from what has become his signature hammy theatricality.  Helena Bonham Carter is, as stated, quite fun, with a few moving moments, though her role is not as substantial as either of the other two.  It's lovely to see her doing some more subtle work compared to what has become her main cinematic type, the psycho woman (not that that's not quite enjoyable too).  The supporting cast is littered with gems, also including Firth's ""Pride & Prejudice"" costar Jennifer Ehle as Logue's wife Myrtle and Sir Derek Jacobi (he of the stammering title character of ""I Claudius"") as Archbishop Lang.  The lone discordant note is Timothy Spall (Harry Potter alum #3) as Winston Churchill.  Admittedly, it is probably difficult to portray an icon of Churchill's stature without doing a bit of caricature, but Spall's interpretation is way too broad; but he's only in three fairly brief scenes, so it doesn't drag things down.The film has taken a few knocks on the issue of historical accuracy.  As an historian with considerable interest in the history of appeasement, there are indeed some things altered here, mainly relating to Churchill's involvement in the abdication crisis (he was a staunch supporter of Edward, not George) (the film also gives Stanley Baldwin more credit than he deserved; in fact, he didn't realize he had been wrong when resigning in 1937, he was simply ready to retire).  The film largely skips over the actual appeasement debates of 1938, cutting from the coronation to the outbreak of war.  Much as with Spall's subpar work, this is peripheral to the main story, which is the relationship between George VI and Logue; the bulk of the film is set pre-coronation, and changing the things people object to would not affect the narrative in any substantial way.  In my view, simply call it dramatic license (it worked fine for Shakespeare, after all).  It's completely normal for historical fiction, and the alterations are hardly important to the film anyway.What the film is about, as previously stated, is the friendship between the King and Logue.  There are a few class and nationality issues at play here, as Logue is both a commoner and the colonial.  The film is expert in depicting a moving male friendship, very welcome at a time when ""bromance"" movies are largely concerned with crass and meaningless issues.  ""The King's Speech"" is much more like its primary Best Picture rival, ""The Social Network"", than most people would notice:  both are about socially awkward individuals dealing with the advent of new communications technologies.  In this case, it's radio.  There are also many thematic similarities with 2006's ""The Queen"", to which ""The King's Speech"" could be considered an unofficial prequel.  The script by David Seidler is witty and well-structured, and one can see evidence of Seidler's (who also had a stammer as a child) personal interest in his subject.  Director Tom Hooper has been slagged in some quarters as unworthy for consideration as Best Director this year, but he actually does an excellent job of moving beyond the standard Merchant-Ivory template for period films.  It's not revolutionary work by any means, but it's very strong nonetheless.Oh, and the R-rating is an absolute joke.  A few (okay, more than a few) swear words in two scenes keep out anyone under 17, whereas they can go see any of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films' depictions of massive battlefield slaughter without issue.  There is nothing in this film unsuitable for anyone in junior high school or above.Highly recommended.",5,Knockout period drama featuring a lifetime-best lead performance.,1296950400,"02 6,

1365289,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,B003UESJH4,Sheri in Reho,"[1, 1]","I originally saw The King's Speech in theatres not long before the Oscar ceremony at which the movie took home three of the top awards (Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor).  I was happy to be able to cheer for it on Oscar night, knowing first-hand that it was the best movie of the year.  I knew then that I would own it on DVD because it is one of those movies you can enjoy multiple times.The King's Speech, based on a true story, begins while King George V is still on the throne but is in failing health.  As he is portrayed in the movie (by Michael Gambon), the King is a masterful orator and a strong leader, but a cruel and impatient father.  His eldest son, David, the Prince of Wales (Guy Pearce), a man too busy living the good life to care much about his responsibilities or his country, is next in line for the throne.  His younger brother, Albert, the Duke of York (Colin Firth), has had a crippling stammer since early childhood and, as a result, he has been treated as being ""less than"" his entire life and considered unfit for the throne.After the crippling failure of a public speech, Albert (aka Bertie) begins seeing various speech therapists, each with crazier ideas about how to ""fix"" him and all to no avail.  Finally, his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) finds an unorthodox speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) on the sly and enlists him to work with her husband.  After a shaky start (Lionel insists on working with the Duke as equals, which doesn't go over well with the Royals), Bertie actually begins to have success at speaking without a stammer.When King George V dies, David ascends to the throne as King Edward VIII, but his heart is not in it.  He is in love with a married American woman and is told that he will not be permitted to marry a divorced woman and be King, so he decides to abdicate the throne at the end of 1936.  This thrusts his younger brother into the role of King, which requires much public speaking. At that time, the wireless radio was new and was used to address the masses.  With the help of Mr. Logue, Bertie faces this new challenge head-on and surprises everyone.This film has a perfect blend of drama and comedy, as well as a great motivational story.  There are some heart-breaking moments, but the movie never becomes tear-jerky.  There are also some hilarious moments, usually in the treatment sessions between Bertie and Logue, when Logue's irreverence pushes Bertie's buttons and his odd treatment methods make for some wacky visuals.  It is a joy to see these two become dear friends.Firth is impressively believable not only in the physical manifestation of the speech defect but in portraying a man who feels helpless, trapped and embarrassed by it.  Rush is both hilarious and touching as Logue in a wonderful performance that I wish had been recognized with an Oscar (he was nominated but did not win).  Helena Bonham Carter brings a combination of upper class charm and surprising wit to her role as Bertie's loving wife.There are a number of extras on the DVD, including:* A commentary with director Tom Hooper.* A documentary on the friendship between Logue and Bertie.* A Q&A; with director and cast members.* Two of the film's pivotal speeches as given by the real King George VI.* The Real Lionel Logue: A family member speaks about him and the diaries and letters he left behind that were used as source material for the movie.* A website for The Stuttering Foundation, where stutterers can get help.Highly recommended even if, like me, you aren't much of a history buff.",5,"Superb movie, amazing cast, a must-see!",1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,3577,"['originally', 'saw', 'King', 'Speech', 'theatres', 'not', 'long', 'Oscar', 'ceremony', 'movie', 'took', 'home', 'three', 'top', 'awards', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Actor', 'was', 'happy', 'be', 'able', 'cheer', 'Oscar', 'night', 'knowing', 'first-hand', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'year', 'knew', 'then', 'would', 'own', 'DVD', 'one', 'movies', 'can', 'enjoy', 'multiple', 'times.The', 'King', 'Speech', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'still', 'throne', 'failing', 'health', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'King', 'masterful', 'orator', 'strong', 'leader', 'cruel', 'impatient', 'father', 'eldest', 'son', 'David', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'man', 'too', 'busy', 'living', 'good', 'life', 'care', 'much', 'responsibilities', 'country', 'next', 'line', 'throne', 'younger', 'brother', 'Albert', 'Duke', 'York', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'had', 'crippling', 'stammer', 'early', 'childhood', 'result', 'been', 'treated', 'being', 'less', 'entire', 'life', 'considered', 'unfit', 'throne.After', 'crippling', 'failure', 'public', 'speech', 'Albert', 'Bertie', 'seeing', 'various', 'speech', 'therapists', 'crazier', 'ideas', 'how', 'fix', 'avail', 'Finally', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'unorthodox', 'speech', 'therapist', 'named', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'sly', 'work', 'husband', 'shaky', 'start', 'Lionel', 'working', 'Duke', 'equals', ""n't"", 'go', 'over', 'well', 'Royals', 'Bertie', 'actually', 'have', 'success', 'speaking', 'stammer.When', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'David', 'throne', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'heart', 'not', 'love', 'married', 'American', 'woman', 'told', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'permitted', 'marry', 'divorced', 'woman', 'be', 'King', 'abdicate', 'throne', 'end', '1936', 'younger', 'brother', 'role', 'King', 'much', 'public', 'speaking', 'time', 'wireless', 'radio', 'was', 'new', 'was', 'used', 'address', 'masses', 'help', 'Mr.', 'Logue', 'Bertie', 'new', 'challenge', 'head-on', 'everyone.This', 'film', 'perfect', 'blend', 'drama', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'motivational', 'story', 'are', 'heart-breaking', 'moments', 'movie', 'never', 'tear-jerky', 'are', 'also', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'usually', 'treatment', 'sessions', 'Bertie', 'Logue', 'when', 'Logue', 'irreverence', 'Bertie', 'buttons', 'odd', 'treatment', 'methods', 'make', 'wacky', 'visuals', 'joy', 'see', 'two', 'become', 'dear', 'friends.Firth', 'impressively', 'believable', 'not', 'only', 'physical', 'manifestation', 'speech', 'defect', 'portraying', 'man', 'who', 'helpless', 'trapped', 'embarrassed', 'Rush', 'hilarious', 'touching', 'Logue', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'recognized', 'Oscar', 'was', 'nominated', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'combination', 'upper', 'class', 'charm', 'surprising', 'wit', 'role', 'Bertie', 'loving', 'wife.There', 'are', 'number', 'extras', 'DVD', 'including', '*', 'commentary', 'director', 'Tom', 'Hooper', '*', 'documentary', 'friendship', 'Logue', 'Bertie', '*', 'A', 'Q', 'A', 'director', 'cast', 'members', '*', 'Two', 'film', 'pivotal', 'speeches', 'given', 'real', 'King', 'George', 'VI', '*', 'Real', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'family', 'member', 'speaks', 'diaries', 'letters', 'left', 'behind', 'were', 'used', 'source', 'material', 'movie', '*', 'A', 'website', 'Stuttering', 'Foundation', 'where', 'stutterers', 'can', 'get', 'help.Highly', 'recommended', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'history', 'buff']",N/A

Reviews and promos for the movie made it seem intelligent, sophisticated, mature (which is the opposite of me) and uninteresting (my picture is next to that word in the dictionary). So I was not compelled to watch this movie at all. Thankfully, my mother-in-law did indeed want to see it, and rented it last week. So we all went over to ""Mom's"" house for movie night.Ironically, ""Mom"" fell asleep half way through the movie (that says nothing about the film; she does that during every movie); I on the other hand had the pleasure of being captivated from start to finish by this classic tale of King George VI and his plight to overcome his infamous stammer. The movie is so well acted by all players and so well directed that you might think you are watching all of the scenes as they actually happened circa the late 1930s.

Geoffrey Rush is excellent as Lionel Logue, the therapist, and his unorthodox methods rub Bertie up the wrong way, but soon get the desired results.  Bonham-Carter is also good as Elizabeth (the Queen Mother) whose support for Bertie helps him through the tough times of his brothers abdication and the outbreak of war.This is set in the lead up to the second world war and also features such people as Churchill (played by Timothy Spall) and has newsreel footage from the times which enhances the overall feel and helps submerge you into the story and period.Everyone acts very well in this film and whilst it has a gentle pace, without any need for special effects or other Hollywood tricks, the story is engrossing enough to keep you enthralled for the duration.  Firth has been especially lauded for this film and after recently seeing him acting excellently in `A Single Man', one can easily say he is at the height of his acting abilities at the moment.It is fascinating to get another view of the abdication and inner workings of the royal house during this tumultuous time and the story of Bertie's struggle with his stammer adds a human element to both the royal family and film.This is well written, acted and directed and I enjoyed it immensely.  This has received many recommendations and much deserved praise and I can only add my own recommendation and praise to this.

1365298,A31RNXQHD106YY,B003UESJH4,"Stephen O. Murray ""Stephen O. Murray""","[1, 1]","""The King's Speech"" was clearly Oscar-bait: being period British movie and a  movie about overcoming a handicap (a variant of the underdog sports movie very much in the tradition of ""Chariots of Fire""). It has a phenomenal cast, including I small parts Guy Pearce, Claire Bloom, Michael Gambon, Anthony Andrews, Timothy Spall, and Derek Jacobi. Colin Firth carries the movie with a compelling performance as the stammering second son of George V, who succeeds his elder brother to the throne when the latter marries the twice-divorced American commoner Wallis Simpson and abdicates.Firth has more than a stammer and overcoming the terrors of speaking in public: he is utterly convincing as the less-favored son of rather frightfully cold parents, and as a more loving father (than his own). As his helpmate wife Helena Bonham Carter is superb. Both have some very funny scenes in the flat where uncredentialed but effective Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) lives and works. Rush makes the part quite physical, though he/his character knows when to be still, too.The DVD includes a director's commentary track, a nearly half-hour but bland ""making of"" featurette, ten minutes of Logue's grandson speaking about discovering the diaries and correspondence. The most interesting bonus feature IMO is a recording of the titular speech, at the start of WWII (3 September 1939). It and a video recording of the king-emperor's V-E speech (1945) show that the stammer was being overcome, was never ""cured."" There are noticeable pauses, especially before words starting with b,p, or w. Firth had the Logue-assisted king down very accurately. I don't think there are recordings of excruciating (for the speaker and audience) untreated stammer, but I think it was as bad as Firth portrays it as having been.The various bonus features tend to repeat the same clips, btw. And Logue calling His Royal Majesty ""Bertie""  is a touch that his grandson finds dubious, along with swearing along with the prince. Winston Churchill's role is enhanced in the movie, and his position on the abdication of Edward VIII misrepresented. (George VI's opposition to appeasing Hitler is also very dubious.)",5,Load of bonus features augment 2010 Oscar best movie,1304035200,"04 29, 2011",2011,2199,"['King', 'Speech', 'was', 'clearly', 'Oscar-bait', 'being', 'period', 'British', 'movie', 'movie', 'overcoming', 'handicap', 'variant', 'underdog', 'sports', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'tradition', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'phenomenal', 'cast', 'including', 'small', 'parts', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'movie', 'compelling', 'performance', 'stammering', 'second', 'son', 'George', 'V', 'who', 'elder', 'brother', 'throne', 'when', 'latter', 'marries', 'twice-divorced', 'American', 'commoner', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'abdicates.Firth', 'more', 'stammer', 'overcoming', 'terrors', 'speaking', 'public', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'less-favored', 'son', 'rather', 'frightfully', 'cold', 'parents', 'more', 'loving', 'father', 'own', 'helpmate', 'wife', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'superb', 'have', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'flat', 'where', 'uncredentialed', 'effective', 'Australian', 'speech', 'therapist', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Rush', 'part', 'quite', 'physical', 'he/his', 'character', 'when', 'be', 'still', 'too.The', 'DVD', 'director', 'commentary', 'track', 'nearly', 'half-hour', 'bland', 'making', 'featurette', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Logue', 'grandson', 'speaking', 'discovering', 'diaries', 'correspondence', 'most', 'interesting', 'bonus', 'feature', 'IMO', 'recording', 'titular', 'speech', 'start', 'WWII', '3', 'September', '1939', 'video', 'recording', 'king-emperor', 'V-E', 'speech', '1945', 'show', 'stammer', 'was', 'being', 'overcome', 'was', 'never', 'cured', 'are', 'noticeable', 'pauses', 'especially', 'words', 'starting', 'b', 'p', 'w.', 'Firth', 'had', 'Logue-assisted', 'king', 'down', 'very', 'accurately', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'recordings', 'excruciating', 'speaker', 'audience', 'untreated', 'stammer', 'think', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'Firth', 'having', 'been.The', 'various', 'bonus', 'features', 'tend', 'repeat', 'same', 'clips', 'btw', 'Logue', 'calling', 'Royal', 'Majesty', 'Bertie', 'touch', 'grandson', 'dubious', 'swearing', 'along', 'prince', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'role', 'enhanced', 'movie', 'position', 'abdication', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'misrepresented', 'George', 'VI', 'opposition', 'appeasing', 'Hitler', 'also', 'very', 'dubious']",N/A

The aforementioned  speech was, in a word, disastrous.Colin Firth plays Prince Albert Frederick Arthur ""Bertie"" George, the Duke of York, the King's second son, and later King George the Sixth who, to overcome a devastating stammering (stuttering) problem, sees Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian non-credentialed and eccentric speech therapist living in London.Bertie and Logue eventually become friends as they work together, and after Bertie's brother abdicates the throne, the new King relies on Logue to help him make a radio broadcast on Britain's declaration of war on Germany in 1939.After I saw this movie, it left me paradoxically...speechless.  That's how good it was.This is a movie that effectively presents a realistic depiction of the frustration and fear of speaking faced by people who stammer on a daily basis.  In fact, at one point Bertie wanted to be known as:""Mad King George the Stammerer.""To add yet more realism, nine weeks before filming began, Logue's notebooks were discovered.  Actual quotations from them were incorporated into the script!In this movie, two actors stand out.  First, Colin Firth who does a superb job of depicting a king with a significant speech problem.  He actually got training to learn how to speak realistically with a speech impediment.  Second, Geoffrey Rush gives an admirable performance as the eccentric speech therapist.  His depiction of Lionel Logue was so good that I can understand why Logue became known as ""an uncommon commoner.""Other aspects of this movie such as photography, cinematography, visual style, and art direction also deserve high praise.  I also appreciated the background music--music by Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms.Finally, the DVD set (released in April 2011 by Alliance Films) is perfect both in visual and audio quality.  The second disc has five extras including speeches from the real King George the Sixth.In conclusion, after seeing this uplifting movie, you'll probably be...lost for words.  This is a superior and intelligent historical drama fit for a king--and the rest of us!!  I leave you with one of Lionel Logue's tongue twisters:""I'm a thistle-sifter.  I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.

Even a small audience can be enough to take you out of your comfort zone. Imagine that you stammer and you're required to speak live to more than a quarter of the Earth's population. Throw in the fact that your audience is frightened due to the impending war against Hitler's Germany. A confident, optimistic and inspirational speech is essential.That's the situation King George VI found himself in.Historical dramas generally bore me. I'm not particularly interested in the royal family, despite living in the UK for the first 43 years of my life, and have no love for them at all. But for some reason, this works.Tom Hooper directed the excellent The Damned United, but this is even better. He chose to shoot most of the film in dark rooms rather than focus on the potential splendor offered by Buckingham Palace. Apart from a scene inside Westminster Abbey, most of the rooms are drab. The story is character-driven and works because of the acting rather than the setting.Colin Firth gives a brilliant performance as King George VI, although he isn't king when the film begins; he's the Duke of York. We see him stumble over an early speech in the 1920s and his wife, Queen Elizabeth (Carter), seeks a speech therapist to help him overcome his impediment.Doesn't that sound boring?She finds Lionel Logue (Rush) who has a practice in London's famous Harley Street and forces her husband to see him. Rush is great as the Australian therapist and supplies much of the humor in the film. The two initially enter into a doctor/patient relationship and eventually become friends.If I had read that premise without knowing anything else about the story, there's no way you could have convinced me I would care about the characters or the outcome. But the quality of the acting overcomes all that and I did end up caring about a historical speech delivered by a monarch in whom I had zero interest. That says something about the power of this film.Fans of the Harry Potter movies will be familiar with Michael Gambon, Timothy Spall and Helena Bonham Carter. It's interesting to see them here in serious roles.The driving force of the story is the friendship between Logue and the future king. Indeed, Logue insists that the two function as equals and calls the Duke Bertie. He apparently has little respect for the monarchy and makes fun of it throughout. Strangely, I'm reminded of The Shawshank Redemption. The two main characters are in a difficult situation and yet manage to form an unlikely friendship, with each sustaining the other.We are shown early attempts by renowned physicians to cure the Duke's stammer, but no progress is made. The Duke's wife finds Logue and arranges an appointment. Logue's methods are unconventional to say the least and provide some of the film's humor. It's a big step for the Duke to trust this irreverent foreigner and relax enough to make progress.If you allow yourself to be drawn into the story, a peculiar thing happens. Rather than focusing on Firth's technique for stammering, you will start to think about the man he's portraying. There are scenes showing how he behaves when he's alone with his wife and his two little girls, and how they accept him for who he is.Firth's portrayal isn't over the top. He's a reserved man who isn't used to speaking up for himself. Over the course of the story, we see him grow. He finds that he has a voice.The R-rating is for language and it absolutely has to be there for the story to work so effectively.The technical aspects of the film are superb. The sets, costumes, casting, sound and pacing are close to perfect. It won four Oscars: Best picture, best director (Hooper), actor in a leading role (Firth) and original screenplay (David Seidler). During his acceptance speech, Seidler revealed that he used to stammer. That explains why he was able to portray that fear so well.The film won't appeal to everyone. It succeeds because of the dialogue and the strength of the story. There's no action and very little romance. If you like human interest stories, give it a try. It's among the best in that category.Video Quality 4/5The video presentation isn't spectacular. The color palette is faded and wintry, filled with grays and blacks. There's occasional noise, such as in the dark shots taken in Logue's elevator. Detail is inconsistent, but strong in places. Most of these appear to be the intended look of the film, but it's slightly disappointing overall.Audio Quality 4/5The sound does exactly what it's supposed to do. There are a few instances of crowd noise and background sounds in the streets of London, but this is a film rich in dialogue. It comes across as clear and even throughout.Special Features 3.5/5The features appear sparse, but what's present is certainly worth checking out. I would be interested in a more comprehensive package in the future.Director Tom Hooper's audio commentary is extremely informative.There's a 23-minute feature with cast and crew detailing the making of the film.A 22-minute Q&A; session with Hooper, Firth, Carter, Pearce and Claire Bloom seems to end all too quickly.Two speeches from the real King George VI show exactly what Firth achieved. As well as the stutter, Firth had to incorporate a slight impediment when using the letter R. One of the speeches appears at the end of the film, so you can see just how accurate Firth's portrayal was.The real Lionel Logue is a 10-minute feature with his grandson Mark. We learn that he discovered some of Logue's diaries containing actual accounts of the meetings with the Duke. A few lines of dialogue were taken from those accounts and used in the film.And finally, a Public service announcement from the Stuttering Foundation.Similar MoviesIt's hard to compare this to any other movie. There's nothing quite like it. I have already mentioned that the friendship reminds me of The Shawshank Redemption, but the overall tone is very different. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is another brilliant film about a man trying to overcome his inability to communicate, although in a more extreme way.Overall VerdictI saw every best picture nomination last year and this was top of my list. Inception and Black Swan both impressed, but for a combination of an engaging story and the technical aspects of making a film, The King's Speech deserved its Oscar success. See it if you enjoy dramas or period paces driven by dialogue.",5,"It shouldn't appeal to me, but it does",1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,6764,"['King', 'SpeechCast', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Geoffrey',

Now he's in fine form in the King's Speech where he plays stuttering regent Bertie, who eventually became George VI, which allows him to flex those acting chops and deliver an emotional role that covers events of great historical importance. The matter of speaking in a steady voice, taken for granted by so many of us, is given the full treatment here, as is his various family agonies, and the tumult of the times leading up to World War II. Of interest as well is that the film, despite being set in the 1930s, includes figures who are still a part of our modern lives, such as Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (also known as the Queen Mother, and played without her characteristic goofiness by a pleasantly restrained Helena Bonham Carter), and his daughter Elizabeth (also known as Queen Elizabeth II). Geoffrey Rush is, of course, Geoffrey Rush, and brilliant as Lionel Logue, an eccentric Australian speech therapist whose methods (nor even his very existence) are not at all trusted by the snooty upper crust that surround George VI; but he's a trooper and he carries on regardless, showing them their place as much as he possible can.

The King's Speech has an all-star cast and I expect that some of them will be on the Queen's Birthday Honours List this mid-June especially Oscar Winner Colin Firth. I wouldn't be surprised if Geoffrey Rush received an Australian honor as well as Helena Bonham Carter in the list. But I'm not going to spill my predictions now. It's three months away.Anyway the story of King George VI better known as Bertie to his wife and family comes about because of his brother's abdication to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. The scandalous relationship between his brother and Wallis fueled fear of the monarchy's destruction ever since. Ever since the scandal, the family has been wary of causing another one. In this film, Bertie must take over the reigns as King of England but he has a stammering problem since childhood. He has been to doctors and specialists. His wife finds Lionel Logue, an actor and speech therapist. The relationship between Logue and Bertie is more about friendship, trust, and understanding. Logue doesn't even tell his family that he's helping the Duke of Windsor.There are plenty of brilliant moments in the film in depiction of pre-World War II England. Helena Bonham Carter does a fine job in playing the future Queen Mother, Elizabeth I, or the Duchess of Windsor in this film. She's supportive and loving towards Bertie. The rest of the cast includes Guy Pearce as the King who abdicates his throne for Wallis Simpson (played by Eve Best). Jennifer Ehle plays Mrs. Logue. Sir Michael Gambon plays the King and Claire Bloom plays his Queen.When you watch the film, you realize that nobody wants to be king after all. It's not an ideal job with no privacy and very few friends rather than acquaintances and fellow politicians. The King's Speech is important because it also reflects the British people on the verge of declaring war with Germany over Poland's invasion.In the end, you must imagine Bertie coming through during the country's most difficult time in the last century.

There are speeches from the real King George VI which are almost painful to watch, knowing the suffering they caused him.  But the most fascinating--and I'm NOT using the term lightly--is the director's commentary on the making of the film.This is practically a course on filmmaking: he explains each scene and how it was shot. He explains how the scenes were framed and why; the reasons why the camera angle and lens size were selected and to what effect they were used; the real places in which each scene was shot and how they compare with the ""real"" place in which they happened; he commented on historical anecdotes about the time, the places, the people, the reality of the moment. I know this sounds kind of dry but, believe me, it isn't.You come to realize how much research and commitment is involved in making a historical movie and how not even the slightest nuance is accidental. Even the smallest gesture or look is an integral part of the whole. The light, the cameras, the lenses, the angles, the settings, the music--everything--is methodically calculated to manipulate mood and emotion and to pace the story towards its conclusion. I came to understand why the words ""Art"" and ""Science"" are in the name of the Motion Picture Academy. It is truly a mix of both.He spoke about the actors and how their input, involvement, and improvisations helped shape, not only their own performances, but the mood and the scope of the film as a whole. How a limited budget impacted and limited their options; the scenes that were left out and why; and he gave us an inside view of the nitty-gritty side of making a film with talk about steady cams, map painting (which was easy to deduce), and ""CGI work"" which I had to look up.

1365321,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B003UESJH4,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[6, 7]","""The King's Speech"" is simply the best film of 2010. Everything from the script to the convincing performances by its actors make this picture a must-see and a soon to be classic.The movie deals with Prince Albert, Duke of York, the second son of King George V, who deals with a severe stammering problem. The movie follows his stuggle with his speech impediment, his anxiety over becoming the King of England knowing he will have to make public speeches to thousands while possessing this problem, and his attempts to overcome his stutter.As someone who suffers from a speech disorder for the majority of my life I could relate to this film immensely. Colin Firth (who plays Prince Albert) does an extraordinary job in portraying someone with a stammer. Watching him you would actually believe he (Colin) suffers from the same impediment in real life: that is how convincing Colin's performance is.Queen Elizabeth of England was able to watch the movie in a private screening in January, 2011 and was very touched by the film as Prince Albert, Duke of York was her real-life father.Colin Firth would go on to win all the major Best Actor wins at different awards ceremonies for this role, but more importantly he won a well-deserved Oscar as Best Actor at the 83rd Academy Awards on February 27, 2011. The movie was nominated for an impressive 12 Oscar nods, winning Best Director for Tom Hooper, Best Original Screenplay (David Seidler), and ""The King's Speech"" was named Best Picture.The movie grossed an amazing $236,000,000 at the worldwide box office on an $8,000,000 budget making it a certified hit.Like writer David Seidler stated at the Oscars upon winning the golden statue, """"The King's Speech"" has given a voice to all stammerers throughout the world"".

1365324,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B003UESJH4,The Guardian,"[0, 0]","In contrast to the Academy's puzzling choice of Best Picture in 2010 (the instantly forgettable `The Hurt Locker'), in 2011 the award of Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Screenplay to this fine film seems to have been anticipated by all and greeted with universal acclaim.The story is one which most viewers will already know, so spoiler alerts ought to be unnecessary. The stammer suffered by King George VI (known as the Duke of York in public and `Bertie' in private prior to his wholly unexpected and unlooked-for coronation, following his elder brother's sudden abdication in 1936), especially whilst speaking in public, had defeated even the most able speech therapists laden with high medical credentials. Bertie's wife Elizabeth (played by Helena Bonham-Carter in one of her best-ever roles) sought out Lionel Logue, a highly unconventional Australian with no formal qualifications in speech therapy who employed self-taught, unorthodox but highly effective techniques developed whilst treating traumatised survivors of the WW1 trenches to speak again. The development of an improbable relationship of trust and mutual respect between Colin Firth's Bertie and Geoffrey Rush's Logue is at the heart of the drama; explored with intelligence, poignancy and sharp humour, it's one of the best realised screenplays of recent years.The first-class acting tour-de-force from the two male leads is boosted by a stellar supporting cast: the aforementioned Ms. Bonham-Carter as the Duchess of York/Queen Elizabeth; Michael Gambon in excellent form as George V (whose untimely demise initiated the constitutional crisis); Guy Pearce as the less-than-sympathetic Edward VIII; Jennifer Ehle as Lionel's wife Myrtle and Tim Spall hamming it up as Winston Churchill. Tom Hooper's direction is a textbook lesson in how to involve an audience from first frame to last by using fine character actors delivering a first-class script, snappy editing, pacy and involving storyline, witty and intelligent one-liners and a tension-packed but ultimately triumph-over-adversity-feelgood ending.The film has received some minor criticisms for its compression of real-life timescales: Bertie and Logue in reality began working together as early as 1926 and Bertie's stammer was much improved after only a few months; Churchill was not PM nor even in the Cabinet on the declaration of war in September 1939 and no cheering crowds greeted the King's outbreak-of-war speech, and so on. However the film is not a documentary but a piece of drama, and these few liberties are taken (as in many a decent drama) to enable it to work effectively in a 2-hour timeframe.The plaudits surrounding `The King's Speech' are entirely justified, as are the basket of top-level awards it's scooped. It's entertaining, clever and edge-of-seat riveting. Colin Firth's performance in particular is a marvel, and will likely be one of the best you'll see this year.'The King's Speech' is everything a truly great film should be, and a deserving multiple award-winner.",5,"A deserving Academy Award winner: witty, intelligent, entertaining and life-affirming",1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,3042,"['contrast', 'Academy', 'puzzling', 'choice', 'Best', 'Picture', '2010', 'instantly', 'forgettable', 'Hurt', 'Locker', '2011', 'award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'fine', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'anticipated', 'greeted', 'universal', 'acclaim.The', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'already', 'know', 'so', 'spoiler', 'alerts', 'ought', 'be', 'unnecessary', 'stammer', 'suffered', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'known', 'Duke', 'York', 'public', 'Bertie', 'private', 'prior', 'wholly', 'unexpected', 'unlooked-for', 'coronation', 'following', 'elder', 'brother', 'sudden', 'abdication', '1936', 'especially', 'whilst', 'speaking', 'public', 'had', 'defeated', 'even', 'most', 'able', 'speech', 'therapists', 'laden', 'high', 'medical', 'credentials', 'Bertie', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'played', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'one', 'best-ever', 'roles', 'sought', 'out', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'highly', 'unconventional', 'Australian', 'formal', 'qualifications', 'speech', 'therapy', 'who', 'employed', 'self-taught', 'unorthodox', 'highly', 'effective', 'techniques', 'developed', 'whilst', 'treating', 'traumatised', 'survivors', 'WW1', 'trenches', 'speak', 'again', 'development', 'improbable', 'relationship', 'trust', 'mutual', 'respect', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Bertie', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Logue', 'heart', 'drama', 'explored', 'intelligence', 'poignancy', 'sharp', 'humour', 'one', 'best', 'realised', 'screenplays', 'recent', 'years.The', 'first-class', 'acting', 'tour-de-force', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'boosted', 'stellar', 'supporting', 'cast', 'aforementioned', 'Ms.', 'Bonham-Carter', 'Duchess', 'York/Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'excellent', 'form', 'George', 'V', 'untimely', 'demise', 'initiated', 'constitutional', 'crisis', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'less-than-sympathetic', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Lionel', 'wife', 'Myrtle', 'Tim', 'Spall', 'hamming', 'up', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'direction', 'textbook', 'lesson', 'how', 'involve', 'audience', 'first', 'frame', 'last', 'using', 'fine', 'character', 'actors', 'delivering', 'first-class', 'script', 'snappy', 'editing', 'pacy', 'involving', 'storyline', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'one-liners', 'tension-packed', 'ultimately', 'triumph-over-adversity-feelgood', 'ending.The', 'film', 'received', 'minor', 'criticisms', 'compression', 'real-life', 'timescales', 'Bertie', 'Logue', 'reality', 'began', 'working', 'together', 'as', 'early', '1926', 'Bertie', 'stammer', 'was', 'much', 'improved', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'Churchill', 'was', 'not', 'PM', 'even', 'Cabinet', 'declaration', 'war', 'September', '1939', 'cheering', 'crowds', 'greeted', 'King', 'outbreak-of-war', 'speech', 'so', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'documentary', 'piece', 'drama', 'few', 'liberties', 'are', 'taken', 'many', 'decent', 'drama', 'enable', 'work', 'effectively', '2-hour', 'timeframe.The', 'plaudits', 'surrounding', 'King', 'Speech', 'are', 'entirely', 'justified', 'are', 'basket', 'top-level', 'awards', 'scooped', 'entertaining', 'clever', 'edge-of-seat', 'riveting', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'performance', 'particular', 'marvel', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'one', 'best', ""'ll"", 'see', 'year', 'King', 'Speech', 'everything', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'deserving', 'multiple', 'award-winner']",N/A

David Seidler's script is simple but witty, eloquent without aiming for eloquence.  That's because it's a tribute to one of Seidler's inspirations, as Seidler himself worked to overcome his stutter as a young man.  Seidler puts the focus on the people rather than the history, which is precisely why the film succeeds.  Colin Firth is perfect casting, his firm, regal brow and humble humor just what the part needs, and his chemistry with Geoffrey Rush, whose own charismatic majesty sometimes outshines Firth's own, brings to life the bond of their characters.  The film's great oddity is its director, Tom Hooper, versed almost exclusively in British TV, and it shows in the dreary colors and muted lighting.  Hooper uses the oldest trick in the avant-garde book, constantly framing each character in the right or left corner of the image.

Hoier ""thoier""","[2, 4]","First off, I'd give this movie 3.5 Stars as opposed to 3.Secondly I think that, when you win Best Picture, it must be extraordinary and 'The King's Speech' isn't quite extraordinary.  It is very good and Firth, Carter and Geoffrey Rush are outstanding.  Bravo to all of you chaps.Firth becomes King George VI and stammers when he speaks (unless he's using numerous four letter words in succession in an elevated voice...which I highly recommend whether you stammer or not).  He befriends an unlicensed speech therapist and the adventure begins.I think this movie shares a lot of the same qualities 'The Karate Kid' had, although there are no Asian people or high school hooligans threatening to beat up the Duke of York.The methods in which Rush begins to teach his young pupil seem to come from a strange, mysterious world, but they're very effective.  Rolling around on the early 20th Century rugs aren't much different then painting the old wooden fence in the backyard.  Not smoking cigarettes during sessions is a lot like wax on - wax off.  of course, the techniques aren't as important as the results...and this bizarre companionship blossoms into something much more:  eternal friendship and admiration.It is a beautiful thing when the most important element of human nature is captured on screen, and 'The King's Speech' captures it and even exceeds it to a point.  It's Love.I'm sorry I rented this movie two months ago and just got to watching it last night.

1365334,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B003UESJH4,Turfseer,"[5, 7]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***On one level, 'The King's Speech' hits a home run in its moving depiction of how speech therapist Lionel Logue corrects the stammering speech of an arrogant Duke of York and transforms him into now confident monarch (and well-rounded good guy), King George VI. On a much different level, 'The Kings Speech' has a harder time in accurately depicting the true historical circumstances of the king's transformation and the complexity of the political machinations surrounding his ascent to the throne.The creators of the film admittedly took liberties as to the accuracy of the time it took Logue to correct Albert's (The Duke of York, aka 'Bertie's') speech. The film informs that Albert met Logue in 1934, when they actually met earlier in 1926. And within seven months, in 1927, under Logue's tutelage, Albert already showed marked improvement in a speech given to the Australian parliament in Canberra. The film, of course, would like us to believe that it wasn't until 1939, when the WW II had just broken out, that the King finally found his mettle. But it's also possible that the King had improved but then regressed at a certain point, requiring additional instruction on Logue's part. I recently heard Colin Firth remark that he listened to a public speech given by King George as late as 1938, and it was not at all impressive (actually downright embarrassing!).Fiddling with the time line as to how long it took Logue to truly shape the King's speech, is not such a big deal in comparison to the film's distortion of history regarding the political sympathies surrounding the Abdication and the Royal family's attitude toward Hitler. The film hardly calls attention to the fact that Albert's brother, King Edward VIII (later known as the Duke of Windsor following his abdication), was a great admirer of the Nazis (even after the war broke out). What's more, Churchill (played by a completely miscast Timothy Spall), despite having arranged a coalition against the Nazis, inexplicably supported King Edward during the Abdication crisis. Not only wasn't King George a friend of Churchill during the time of the Abdication (for the obvious reason of Churchill's support of his brother) but soon afterward sided with Churchill's political opponent, Neville Chamberlain, who advocated a policy of appeasement toward Hitler. 'The King's Speech' would like us to believe that King George was always against the Nazis, but such an attitude did not emerge, until the war broke out.Despite the historical inaccuracies, 'The King's Speech' pulls us in through the story of a unique and engaging relationship between student and teacher. The opening scene, where Albert must speak publicly for the first time at Wembley Stadium in 1925, establishes the extent of his malady--a stuttering problem that proves to be the source of profound embarrassment for both the Royal Family themselves and the public at large.When the Duke of York meets his therapist, Lionel Logue, the contrast between the two could not be more profound. While Logue exudes a child-like spontaneity, 'Bertie' is uptight and arrogant (Logue's grandson maintains that his grandfather never swore in front of the King nor did he call him 'Bertie'). As their relationship develops, Logue tries to get Albert to see the connection between his stuttering and repressed upbringing. Albert opens up enough to reveal how he had to cope with his strict father and had to endure the family's insistence that he suppress his natural left-handedness and correct a knock-knee condition through the use of painful splints.It's the Abdication and its consequences that causes the 'dark moment' of the Second Act of the narrative. After David (King Edward) accuses Albert of trying to take over the throne by attempting to make himself more competent (via the speech lessons), Albert becomes completely tongue-tied and is unable to reply to his brother's humiliating taunts, which he endured so many times during his childhood. Then when Logue suggests that Albert can be king, the Duke of York ironically takes his brother's side by accusing Logue of offering up a suggestion that could be construed as being treasonous. The Duke belittles Logue for his failed acting career as well as his lower middle class upbringing.Facing the prospect of making the most important speech of his life, the King eventually realizes that he needs Logue's help and seeks him out again. When the King apologizes, we realize that the king has had an epiphany. The act of 'eating humble pie' brings the King back down to earth; he now finally realizes that he's no better than his subjects despite his royal standing and can now relate to Logue as an equal and not a superior. And Logue must eat a little 'humble pie' of his own when the King reproaches him for likening 'The Stone of Scone' to an outdated relic. Logue comes to respect the institution of the Monarchy as it is now ably represented by King George, who exudes a new found confidence in his position as regent.Geoffrey Rush steals the show in his wonderful depiction of the empathetic and iconoclastic speech therapist. Although he bears no resemblance to the real King George, Colin Firth does an excellent job in conveying the King's inner turmoil, as he vacillates between arrogance and self-knowledge. I wonder if the film's producers might have considered Guy Pearce for the part of the King himself as Pearce bears a striking resemblance to both the Duke of Windsor and King George VI. I actually wanted to see more of him in the film. Helena Bonham Carter doesn't have much to do as the King's wife and I can't understand why she was nominated for best supporting actress.'The King's Speech' ironically is a tale about the oppressed becoming the oppressor. King George was oppressed as a child but became an 'oppressor', as an arrogant and distant monarch.

This is not a political film. It hinges entirely on the relationship between Firth's character and Geoffrey Rush's character. One King, one mentor. It is about friendship, a unique bond in which trust is of the utmost importance.  That is what truly makes this film so special. It feels so genuine and interesting and even when there are conflicts( and there are a few of those) you can't help but hope that everything will work out in the end.The performances are simply stellar. Colin Firth truly transforms and with each and every stutter, it never looks forced. He is truly in a class by himself. Geoffrey Rush is a man that can act in his sleep. Talk about someone who actually manages to steal the spotlight away from the affable Firth. One of his best acting performances in recent memory. Helena Bonham Carter is always a delight to watch. She has a particular manner of speaking with such ease and just a hint of snootiness which I find quite entertaining. Her role is smaller but no less important. These three fine actors work beautifully in sync and have created something of a masterpiece.The musical score is suble, yet admirable, the cinematography is perfection and the costumes are never overdone. All these details make up a film and are no less important than the actors and when all these elements are combined, they create a film such as this. I can literally find not one single complaint about The King's Speech and I find it even more intriguing and wonderful knowing it was based on factual events.

After I watched him in The Kings Speech I found myself standing at the door with my bags packed ready to fly of to London to pursue the possibility of stalking uh I mean uhhh spotting him in a crowd yeah that's what I meant uh huh.  Thankfully for both of us my passport had expired. I've now become an official Firth Zombie .I only went to the theater twice last year and and I can't seem to remember the other movie at all. It wasn't that it was all that forgettable to be fair. It just had to displace this movie from my memory and it just couldn't do it. The restrained passion that is unleashed in this film has you riveted to the screen. The characters while larger than life are just simple human beings in the end. Their need to be significant in their families lives while upholding their duties is a constant drain on their egos. Precious little is left of the peaceful little insular family life for Bertie or his teacher.. The Nation is on a precipice of war and anger against the monarchies frivolities is rampant . A tormented child grown to manhood is being dragged to the front of this spectacle to deliver some much needed motivation and strength via a rousing speech . Can he do it . When it comes right down to it will he be able to deliver the goods. Yes he well and yes they did. A generational gap 0f 60 years would not be enough to dim the purpose and intent of this film. To make you feel that need and that sacrifice. Of a man, a Nation and their families. Well done.I will end this on the note that my other love in cinema is for action adventure and there is plenty to choose from in the states of blockbusters with enormous budgets. Harrison Ford movies immediately come to mind. He was Paid 65 million dollars to be Indiana Jones 4. That Films budget was 185 million and earned 786 million and some change. The entire budget for the Kings Speech was 15 million . It hauled in 250 million. The amount earned by actors is often more a reflection on the actor's ability to get butts in seats and most of the time no reflection on the quality of the acting delivered or the movie itself.  Colin Firth you are woefully under paid. Ask for more next time. You delivered the Goods ; your pay should reflect it. Please continue with your speech...or not .

I've seen like three movies at the theater that I haven't even started writing about, and if I go too long before writing about them I start forgetting details, and then the review is a little generic, and the economy suffers, America falls behind, and let's face it: the terrorists have won. All that riding on my shoulders! You see why I'm stressed. It's all because there has been a ton of WORK at work lately, which is outrageous and inhumane [Amnesty International is currently investigating].All right, I suppose we must turn our attention to the film at hand. This is an Oscar-bait movie that is so all-round good in every way that you'll think it's the mid-90s and Miramax is still owned by the Weinsteins. We open in 1929 with Colin Firth as soon-to-be King George VI barely able to get a complete word out while giving a speech at a public race, to be broadcast nationwide on the radio, then a fairly new invention. This creates a great wrinkle, as before, if you embarrassed yourself, it was just in front of the attending company. Now it's broadcast across the country and perhaps the world. The movie gets the rhythm just right of showing the crowd looking expectantly at him, then slowly turning away as though embarrassed themselves, when they realize how badly he's choking.Then his wife, played by Helena Bonham Carter, goes to the office of Geoffery Rush as Lionel Logue, Australian import and unconventional speech therapist. They have apparently gone to all the other speech therapists, and found them all useless. Logue insists that the future king come to his office [rather than he go to the palace], insists on calling him ""Bertie,"" and imposes a number of other rules, all of which George is not used to. Firth plays George as a proud man mortified by his speech inability, one who quickly leaps to anger rather than deal with feeling embarrassed and inadequate. Rush plays Logue as a sensitive man comfortable with his eccentricity and confident of his then-unusual methods.Logue is the only therapist who is able to get results, so George is soon coming every week. Logue says it's best to work on both psychological and mechanical speech blockages, but George wants ""Just mechanical."" This is all well and good for a while, because the next person in line to be king is George's older brother Edward, played by the always-delightful Guy Pearce. Problem is, Edward is seeing a divorced woman, who is also known to be seeing other men at the same time, and he plans to marry her, although this is strictly forbidden. Nevertheless, George wants Edward to stay on the throne, because if he doesn't George will have to, and this would thrust George into the spotlight, where he will have to endure a series of embarrassing moments on the world's stage. So there's this unspoken issue that George is unable to advance and accept his greatness and move into the next stage of manhood, because he is held back by this issue.What interested me most about this movie is that it is a story about psychotherapy, but taking place before the real age of psychotherapy [Freud was active in Austria, but he hadn't been put into wide practice in England yet]. It is clear that George's speech problems are largely psychological, and as they gradually open up and get to know and trust each other--a relationship that has to navigate all sorts of ideas about Royal vs. non-Royal propriety--George is able to gain confidence and eventually to open up personally to Logue. And there are scenes that will be familiar to anyone who has been through therapy, such as when the therapist pushes the patient too far, and drives him away for a time. So this is all about psychotherapy before there WAS a fully-formed field of psychotherapy.For this reason, as well as the many obstacles thrown up by their differing social stations, the relationship that grows up between George and Logue is incredibly satisfying. George is believably gruff and distant at first, but we also see his anguished vulnerability as he faces horrible public embarrassment. The movie also expertly lays out hints of why he has his psychological issues, but without hammering too hard on any of them. Their relationship grows slowly and believably, without a false note, and it is satisfying toward the end to see George fiercely defending Logue and demanding his right to a place near him [although he is a non-Royal and not even a proper Englishman], as well as crowd-pleasing scenes like when Logue's wife finally learns who her husband's secret client really is.When this first came out, it got somewhat mediocre reviews from some quarters for being the slightest bit TOO perfect. And it's true--it's well-made, well-written, well-acted, and pretty much everything is in place and working perfectly. And since it harks back to the golden age of Miramax and really seems to belong to that era, fifteen years ago, it can seem a little tired even upon release. So the element of surprise and discovering something a bit out of the ordinary is not to be found here. Nevertheless, a movie criticized as being too perfect is still pretty perfect, and there's not necessarily anything wrong with a movie your parents will like every bit as much as you do, or that everyone can agree upon. This may be bald Oscar-bait, but it's worthy Oscar-bait and it deserved the Oscars it won. It's just a plain `ol good, interesting, well-made movie.",4,It's Biggest Problem Is How Good It Is,1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,5453,"['Geeze', 'am', 'SO', 'writing', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'seen',

""The King's Speech"" is nominated for 12 Oscars and, judging by the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards, appears well on its way to winning most of those. Bully, I say.""The King's Speech"" is a great story because it's a true story. Colin Firth plays the verbally challenged King George VI, father of Great Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, the world's longest reigning monarch (1952-present).  Helena Bonham Carter plays George VI's wife known to those of us born after 1952 as the lovable Queen Mum.Geoffrey Rush is the deadpan glue of the film. His portrayal of Lionel Logue is magnificent, showing us that this Australian ""nobody"" was the glue of the British Empire during a critical period, performing a vital secret service for His Majesty.Logue comes off as a masterful psychiatrist (and one without a license or any government-controlled schooling in the subject. Wow, imagine that, President Obama). Logue knew that George VI couldn't be cured by anybody but a friend, somebody the king related to as an equal.  The friendship of ""Bertie"" and Lionel was the secret behind the British people's stout-hearted fight against Nazism during World War II (Churchill helped a bit, too).Another great dig at the culture of ""experts"" - Non-doctor Lionel says the doctors are idiots for recommending smoking to George VI. King: ""But they're all knighted."" Logue: ""Well, that makes it official then.""Considering the elitist societies that Western countries are degenerating into, the king's reaction to learning of Logue's lack of credentials can't be overemphasized. King George makes a decision that shows him to be a great statesman and loyal friend. An elected politician, especially one of today, likely wouldn't have been as brave.King Edward VIII's relationship with American Wallis Simpson is handled well. Lionel (delivering a wonderful deadpan line about the inadequacy of ""Queen Wallis of Baltimore, Maryland"") and Bertie make a vital point about how public admissions of sexuality yield bitter harvests in the lives of nations. Edward VIII's ""honesty"" and ""love"" nearly unhinged the UK.Lionel: ""Can't they just carry on in private?""Bertie (King George): ""If only they'd do that.""Queen Elizabeth II's moral uprightness and long reign of peace and tranquility (including the worthwhile end of empire) go hand and hand. Prince Charles and his sons also seem to be following the fine example set by King George VI. As the British people and the world think about succession, we should be inspired by the king's courage in dealing with the past and future as both of them came flying at him all at once. We should also recall (see Book of Genesis) that G-d's greatest gift to mankind and the thing that sets us apart from the animal world is the power of speech. ""The King's Speech"" is a forever vehicle for learning and relearning these vital truths.",5,His Majesty's Secret Service,1296604800,"02 2, 2011",2011,2949,"['Understated', 'Gripping', 'Powerful', 'other', 'words', 'royal', 'best', 'sense', 'term', 'King', 'Speech', 'nominated', '12', 'Oscars', 'judging', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'Screen', 'Actors', 'Guild', 'Awards', 'well', 'way', 'winning', 'most', 'Bully', 'say', 'King', 'Speech', 'great', 'story', 'true', 'story', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'verbally', 'challenged', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'father', 'Great', 'Britain', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'world', 'longest', 'reigning', 'monarch', '1952-present', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'George', 'VI', 'wife', 'known', 'born', '1952', 'lovable', 'Queen', 'Mum.Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'deadpan', 'glue', 'film', 'portrayal', 'Lionel', 'Logue', 'magnificent', 'showing', 'Australian', 'nobody', 'was', 'glue', 'British', 'Empire', 'critical', 'period', 'performing', 'vital', 'secret', 'service', 'Majesty.Logue', 'off', 'masterful', 'psychiatrist', 'one', 'license', 'government-controlled', 'schooling', 'subject', 'Wow', 'imagine', 'President', 'Obama', 'Logue', 'knew', 'George', 'VI', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'cured', 'anybody', 'friend', 'somebody', 'king', 'related', 'equal', 'friendship', 'Bertie', 'Lionel', 'was', 'secret', 'British', 'people', 'stout-hearted', 'fight', 'Nazism', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Churchill', 'helped', 'bit', 'too', '.Another', 'great', 'dig', 'culture', 'experts', 'Non-doctor', 'Lionel', 'doctors', 'are', 'idiots', 'recommending', 'smoking', 'George', 'VI', 'King', ""'re"", 'knighted', 'Logue', 'Well', 'official', 'then', 'Considering', 'elitist', 'Western', 'countries', 'are', 'degenerating', 'king', 'reaction', 'learning', 'Logue', 'lack', 'credentials', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'overemphasized', 'King', 'George', 'decision', 'be', 'great', 'statesman', 'loyal', 'friend', 'elected', 'politician', 'especially', 'one', 'today', 'likely', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'brave.King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'relationship', 'American', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'handled', 'well', 'Lionel', 'delivering', 'wonderful', 'deadpan', 'line', 'inadequacy', 'Queen', 'Wallis', 'Baltimore', 'Maryland', 'Bertie', 'make', 'vital', 'point', 'how', 'public', 'admissions', 'sexuality', 'yield', 'bitter', 'harvests', 'lives', 'nations', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'honesty', 'love', 'nearly', 'unhinged', 'UK.Lionel', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'carry', 'private', 'Bertie', 'King', 'George', 'only', ""'d"", 'do', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'moral', 'uprightness', 'long', 'reign', 'peace', 'tranquility', 'including', 'worthwhile', 'end', 'empire', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'sons', 'also', 'seem', 'be', 'following', 'fine', 'example', 'set', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'British', 'people', 'world', 'think', 'succession', 'should', 'be', 'inspired', 'king', 'courage', 'dealing', 'past', 'future', 'came', 'flying', 'once', 'should', 'also', 'recall', 'see', 'Book', 'Genesis', 'G-d', 'greatest', 'gift', 'mankind', 'thing', 'apart', 'animal', 'world', 'power', 'speech', 'King', 'Speech', 'forever', 'vehicle', 'learning', 'relearning', 'vital', 'truths']",N/A

I'm sorry, I just don't have the patience or time to deal with people who stutter.  It's annoying and I feel that they should just not try to speak, they should just write things down on paper.  This film lost me half way through and I noticed I began zoning out and just staring blankly at the tv screen.  The strange thing is I usually love British films like Howard's End, Wings of the Dove and Sense and Sensibility.  I think I indentify with female lead roles rather than a male lead.  Helena Bonham Carter was barely in the movie, she had such a small thankless role.  I'm surprised she was nominated for an oscar, she's had much better parts in other films. I also didn't like Geoffery Rush's character, he was too fruity for me and came across like a total closet queen. As far as the best picture win,  I think Black Swan should have won the oscar for best picture.  About the only thing I liked about The King's Speech was the cinematography.  The sets were beautiful and I did enjoy the aestetics and the art direction.
