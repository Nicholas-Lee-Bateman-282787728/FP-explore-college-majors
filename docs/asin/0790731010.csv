I think a stronger narrative would have helped tie things together.The story of the Scot who wouldn't race on the Sabbath was well acted but the woman who played his girlfriend was dreary. It was refreshing to see a Protestant hero that wasn't presented as a hypocrite.The other story of Abrahams was not well thought out.  I kept waiting to hear more about his motivations.  It must have been difficult to be Jewish in an ultra WASPY British Private School but the movie left too much out....The story line was very hard to follow and even boring at times.Filming was washed out.  The slow motion scenes were awful.Very similar to many Masterpiece Theater productions but not as well produced, acted or as sophisticated.

The movie parallels Liddel and Harold Abrahams, a Jewish runner, who are set to race for England in the Paris Olympics. We find two incredibly different individuals protrayed in this film. Liddel runs for God and is quick to give Him the glory for his accomplishmnets. Abrahams runs to prove a point to the prejudice around him and perhaps to prove to himself that he can be a champion.  In Eric Liddel's emotional struggle we are stirred with emotion as we watch him decide to give up worldly fame for Heavenly gain. His story inspires the watcher to prioritize his/her life and stand for what is right even if that means not realizing all of your dreams.  In the end it is Liddel who is satisfied with his life as Abrahams finds that even as a champion there is still something missing in his life. This is a deep movie and some people are not able to take the time that the movie requires to think.

This is the fairly simple (and based on true) story of Harold Abrahams (played by Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Ian Charelson) and their exploits before and during the 1924 Olympic games. The two main characters could not be more different in that Abrahams runs for himself, and greater glory, and to prove his worth in a society that accepts, but eschews his Jewish heritage. The other is a missionarys son who believes God has made him fast for a purpose, and runs to please and honor the almighty. Both have their respective faith, and nerves tested to the limits, often to the detriment of those close to them, but the movie cleverly stays away from pretentious social comment, or philosophical undertones. Producer David Putnam, Writer Colin Welland, and Director Hugh Hudson evoke a time of gentlemen, fair play, decorum and esprit de corps that stays with you long after the end titles roll. There are some excellent supporting roles from a host of well knowns, including Ian Holm, Nigel Havers, and Alice Krige and the film reminds us of a far better and simpler time in the world of sports almost. Deserving of the 4 Oscars bestowed upon it back in 1981 (as a surprise winner)this new widescreen release to a polished DVD format with Dolby sound is a long wait finally over. There are lots of extra's to enjoy on the second disc, making the all round package more than worth the money.

94802,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,0790731010,Andre Dursin,"[11, 11]","Hugh Hudson's 1981 Best Picture winner chronicles the Gold medal winning members of the 1924 British Olympic team: devout Christian missionary Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) and Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a working-class Jew who finds himself fighting bigotry and class discrimination while at Gonville and Caius College in Cambridge. Abrahams' fight to make the British track team, turning the heads of his academic deans (cameos from John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson), is contrasted with Liddell's passionate devotion to his faith and his God-given talent on the track.""Chariots of Fire"" is an especially wonderful film to rediscover with the London games just a few weeks away. A pet project of producer David Puttnam, the movie boasts superb performances from Cross and Charleson, a game supporting cast (Ian Holm is particularly noteworthy as the Turkish coach who works with Abrahams; Alice Krige also makes an impression as Abrahams' love interest), and outstanding cinematography by David Watkin. The memorable footage of the British track team running along the beach, to the strains of Vangelis' chart-topping instrumental theme, comprises some of the most indelible imagery of any sports-oriented picture. Colin Welland's incisive, nicely nuanced screenplay makes for a great period drama and a marvelous character study, showing two very different men working for a common goal in distinctly different ways.One of the things I did notice while watching the film for the first time in many years was that Vangelis' score does seem, at times, out of sorts with the picture itself. Yes, the main theme from the film is an unquestioned classic - but the sparse use of the score makes its occasional presence a distraction when all-synthesized electronic music suddenly appears in the midst of a stately 1920s drama. One moment in particular (when several newspaper headlines flash on-screen) is particularly poor and laughably handled. It's still an effective score, yet one that likely would've worked better had portions of it been orchestrated - as it is, it's the one aspect of the film that stamps it as a product of the time.Warner's Digibook Blu-Ray edition of ""Chariots of Fire"" is spectacular. The AVC encoded 1080p transfer is how every catalog film ought to be treated on Blu-Ray: brilliantly detailed with pitch-perfect contrasts and colors. The DTS MA audio is a lot more subtle as you'd imagine, and ample extras are also included: previously-released documentaries on the making of the film are on-hand plus newer featurettes on the 1924 Paris games, profiles of Puttnam and Hudson, deleted scenes, screen tests, the trailer, and a bonus sampler from Vangelis' soundtrack album (which features a great deal of music not in the film and vice versa).",5,Breathtaking on Blu-Ray,1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,2772,"['Hugh', 'Hudson', '1981', 'Best', 'Picture', 'winner', 'Gold', 'medal', 'winning', 'members', '1924', 'British', 'Olympic', 'team', 'devout', 'Christian', 'missionary', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'working-class', 'Jew', 'who', 'fighting', 'bigotry', 'class', 'discrimination', 'Gonville', 'Caius', 'College', 'Cambridge', 'Abrahams', 'fight', 'make', 'British', 'track', 'team', 'turning', 'heads', 'academic', 'deans', 'cameos', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Lindsay', 'Anderson', 'contrasted', 'Liddell', 'passionate', 'devotion', 'faith', 'God-given', 'talent', 'track', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'film', 'rediscover', 'London', 'games', 'just', 'few', 'weeks', 'away', 'pet', 'project', 'producer', 'David', 'Puttnam', 'movie', 'superb', 'performances', 'Cross', 'Charleson', 'game', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'Turkish', 'coach', 'who', 'Abrahams', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'also', 'impression', 'Abrahams', 'love', 'interest', 'outstanding', 'cinematography', 'David', 'Watkin', 'memorable', 'footage', 'British', 'track', 'team', 'running', 'along', 'beach', 'strains', 'Vangelis', 'chart-topping', 'instrumental', 'theme', 'most', 'indelible', 'imagery', 'sports-oriented', 'picture', 'Colin', 'Welland', 'incisive', 'nicely', 'nuanced', 'screenplay', 'great', 'period', 'drama', 'marvelous', 'character', 'study', 'showing', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'working', 'common', 'goal', 'distinctly', 'different', 'ways.One', 'things', 'did', 'notice', 'watching', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'Vangelis', 'score', 'seem', 'times', 'sorts', 'picture', 'Yes', 'main', 'theme', 'film', 'unquestioned', 'classic', 'sparse', 'use', 'score', 'occasional', 'presence', 'distraction', 'when', 'all-synthesized', 'electronic', 'music', 'suddenly', 'midst', 'stately', '1920s', 'drama', 'One', 'moment', 'particular', 'when', 'several', 'newspaper', 'headlines', 'flash', 'on-screen', 'particularly', 'poor', 'laughably', 'handled', 'still', 'effective', 'score', 'one', 'likely', 'would', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'better', 'had', 'portions', 'been', 'orchestrated', 'one', 'aspect', 'film', 'product', 'time.Warner', 'Digibook', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'spectacular', 'AVC', 'encoded', '1080p', 'transfer', 'how', 'catalog', 'film', 'ought', 'be', 'treated', 'Blu-Ray', 'brilliantly', 'detailed', 'pitch-perfect', 'contrasts', 'colors', 'DTS', 'MA', 'audio', 'lot', 'more', 'subtle', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'ample', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'previously-released', 'documentaries', 'making', 'film', 'are', 'on-hand', 'newer', 'featurettes', '1924', 'Paris', 'games', 'profiles', 'Puttnam', 'Hudson', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'screen', 'tests', 'trailer', 'bonus', 'sampler', 'Vangelis', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'great', 'deal', 'music', 'not', 'film', 'vice', 'versa']",N/A

Best Picture was a race between Warren Betty's lavishly detailed political drama `Reds' and the ghastly mediocre senior citizens rom-com `On Golden Pond'.  After walking away with Oscars in the two lead acting categories, Betty's director Oscar seemed like `Reds' reward and it looked like once again Oscar was going to award the most undeserving in the lineup.  Then, out of nowhere, `Chariots of Fire' came barreling to the podium in a surprise victory that only a handful would have ever predicted.Why can't we have surprises like this today?`Chariots of Fire' is no `Reds'.  It is certainly preachier in tone and is more message heavy (obviously message heavy as opposed to subtly message heavy) but there is a gritty earthy loveliness about `Chariots of Fire' that makes me happy it won the Oscar.  I prefer `Reds' and `Raiders of the Lost Ark' (which is just legendary) overall, but `Chariots of Fire' is far from an undeserved win, and it is one that few people remember and sadly few people have seen.This little film that could boasts an ageless story of man's bout with faith and their abilities to succeed.  Telling parallel stories of two men preparing for the same Olympic race.  Eric Liddell is a Presbyterian son of a missionary who runs for God and thus uses his faith in a higher power as his motivation to go for the gold so-to-speak.  His faith becomes a hurdle for him in moments of consequence, and yet it is his driving force and so it propels him to greatness.  Harold Abrahams is a Jew and scholar who runs to win and feel something in himself, something of worth.  His self-doubts and fears weigh heavily on his progress, but overall self-determination put him in the same vein as Liddell.At the end of the day, `Chariots of Fire' is a beautifully handled sports drama that is more drama than sports (just the way I like it) and thus keeps a slower, more meaningful pace that accentuates the films core principles and keeps it a lingering thought in the viewers mind.",5,A beautiful surprise...,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,2075,"['Back', '1981', 'Oscar', 'night', 'seemed', 'circle', 'around', 'two', 'vastly', 'different', 'prospects', 'Best', 'Picture', 'was', 'race', 'Warren', 'Betty', 'lavishly', 'detailed', 'political', 'drama', 'Reds', 'ghastly', 'mediocre', 'senior', 'citizens', 'rom-com', 'Golden', 'Pond', 'walking', 'away', 'Oscars', 'two', 'lead', 'acting', 'categories', 'Betty', 'director', 'Oscar', 'seemed', 'Reds', 'reward', 'looked', 'once', 'again', 'Oscar', 'was', 'going', 'award', 'most', 'undeserving', 'lineup', 'Then', 'nowhere', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'came', 'barreling', 'podium', 'surprise', 'victory', 'only', 'handful', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'predicted.Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'surprises', 'today', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'Reds', 'certainly', 'preachier', 'tone', 'more', 'message', 'heavy', 'obviously', 'message', 'heavy', 'opposed', 'subtly', 'message', 'heavy', 'gritty', 'earthy', 'loveliness', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'happy', 'won', 'Oscar', 'prefer', 'Reds', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'just', 'legendary', 'overall', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'far', 'undeserved', 'win', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'remember', 'sadly', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'seen.This', 'little', 'film', 'could', 'boasts', 'ageless', 'story', 'man', 'bout', 'faith', 'abilities', 'succeed', 'Telling', 'parallel', 'stories', 'two', 'men', 'preparing', 'same', 'Olympic', 'race', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'Presbyterian', 'son', 'missionary', 'who', 'God', 'thus', 'faith', 'higher', 'power', 'motivation', 'go', 'gold', 'so-to-speak', 'faith', 'hurdle', 'moments', 'consequence', 'yet', 'driving', 'force', 'greatness', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'Jew', 'scholar', 'who', 'win', 'feel', 'something', 'something', 'worth', 'self-doubts', 'fears', 'weigh', 'heavily', 'progress', 'overall', 'self-determination', 'put', 'same', 'vein', 'Liddell.At', 'end', 'day', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'beautifully', 'handled', 'sports', 'drama', 'more', 'drama', 'sports', 'just', 'way', 'thus', 'keeps', 'slower', 'more', 'meaningful', 'pace', 'films', 'core', 'principles', 'lingering', 'thought', 'viewers', 'mind']",N/A

Compare that to a similar Track and Field-based movie released around the same time:  'Personal Best' starring Mariel Hemmingway, written and directed by the great Robert Towne.  Yet, no one remembers that one too much at all.There are two reasons why 'Chariots' hasn't receded from our collective memories.  First, there's the score by Vangelis.  Even beyond the famous theme song, the entire movie is set perfectly to vivid swatches of Vangelis' fertile imagination.Second, there's Hugh Hudson's brilliant imagery of the British runners, clad in 1924 Track and Field regalia, training en masse on the seashore.Put those two elements together:  Vangelis + the beach-treading squad...in short, it's indelible.  To this day, if you're in a road race and someone blares the theme song out their window (and someone invariably will), you will have a chill run down your spine.

94808,A2WCNYAF5HR0PB,0790731010,a reader,"[11, 11]","This has always been a favorite film of mine, and after 20 years I am purchasing it for our church library!  Why?  The film works on a number of different levels.  It is beautifully filmed.  The score seems to express the vitality and freedom a person feels when running.  It takes you to an earlier fascinating era, 1920's England.Other than these things, the film can be enjoyed by teens and adults purely as a sports-Olympic film.  It certainly stands at the head of the cinematic sports genre of films, way above any sports films like Knute Rockne, Ice Castles, Downhill Racer, The Other Side of the Mountain--none I can think of can compare.The film can be enjoyed as a reflection of its era. A profound moment occurs when the students arrive at Cambridge; their bags are carried into their dorm house by gents who are obviously WWI survivors with grotesque facial prostheses.  This makes the new students a little bit uncomfortable and we see how guilty they feel, how lucky they feel to be attending Cambridge, sound of life and limb, whereas had they been a few years older they would probably have been cannon fodder at Belleau Wood or Ypres.  The huge bronze plaque in the house dining room reinforces this feeling; it lists the WWI dead just from that particular Cambridge house.  Their desire to take up the sport of running seems unimportant compared to the ultimate sacrifice their house brothers made so they COULD indulge in their sport.The third level, of course, is religion.  Contrast Eric Liddell's missionary zeal with the sort of whispered prejudice amongst the bigoted Cambridge dons towards Harold's competitive determination.  Harold is out to prove he is worthy, as good as any Christian.  Is someone blessed in life's endeavors because he is godly like Eric Liddell,or is someone just as blessed if he seeks to prove his worth in a world prejudiced against him?  How does faith influence what we do in life?  I find this theme in the film very interesting and satisfying.  Reasons for competition vary, and Abraham's girlfriend really enlightens Harold after he loses a race, when she questions his motivations for running. Can you ultimately be successful in life even if you fail once in awhile?  This film is not reflective of the frenetic American jazz-age; rather it explores an era when Europeans just felt lucky to be alive after a world conflagration.  The reasons why two men run is the essence of the film. You also cannot help contrast the way the Olympics have changed from 1924 to today with their ridiculous overexpansion and vast expense.  I prefer the 1924 version.I enjoy this film for its many levels, and when I think that Reds almost won for best film that year I have to laugh.  Chariots of Fire surely has withstood the test of time (I just watched it again last week); Reds nowadays seems like a LONG BORING film.  Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton no longer matter.Vangelis' score is absolutely perfect.  As much as the main theme was overplayed in the 80s, it still is beautiful, and makes you want to put on your Nikes and head to the track even if you have never run in your life.  The music does not express the jazz age but rather, expresses the exhilaration of running, your hair trailing in your own slip stream, as you stride along a seashore. The film's plot even reverts to Gilbert and Sullivan, which makes the evocation of the era very sweet indeed.",5,Film that works on several lev els,985910400,"03 30, 2001",2001,3409,"['always', 'been', 'favorite', 'film', 'mine', '20', 'years', 'am', 'purchasing', 'church', 'library', 'Why', 'film', 'number', 'different', 'levels', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'score', 'express', 'vitality', 'freedom', 'person', 'feels', 'when', 'running', 'earlier', 'fascinating', 'era', '1920', 'England.Other', 'things', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'teens', 'adults', 'purely', 'sports-Olympic', 'film', 'certainly', 'head', 'cinematic', 'sports', 'genre', 'films', 'way', 'sports', 'films', 'Knute', 'Rockne', 'Ice', 'Castles', 'Downhill', 'Racer', 'Other', 'Side', 'Mountain', 'none', 'can', 'think', 'can', 'compare.The', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'reflection', 'era', 'profound', 'moment', 'when', 'students', 'arrive', 'Cambridge', 'bags', 'are', 'carried', 'dorm', 'house', 'gents', 'who', 'are', 'obviously', 'WWI', 'survivors', 'grotesque', 'facial', 'prostheses', 'new', 'students', 'little', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'see', 'how', 'guilty', 'feel', 'how', 'lucky', 'feel', 'be', 'attending', 'Cambridge', 'sound', 'life', 'limb', 'whereas', 'had', 'been', 'few', 'years', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'Belleau', 'Wood', 'Ypres', 'huge', 'bronze', 'plaque', 'house', 'dining', 'room', 'reinforces', 'feeling', 'WWI', 'dead', 'just', 'particular', 'Cambridge', 'house', 'desire', 'take', 'up', 'sport', 'running', 'unimportant', 'compared', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'house', 'brothers', 'made', 'COULD', 'indulge', 'sport.The', 'third', 'level', 'course', 'religion', 'Contrast', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'missionary', 'zeal', 'sort', 'whispered', 'prejudice', 'amongst', 'bigoted', 'Cambridge', 'dons', 'towards', 'Harold', 'competitive', 'determination', 'Harold', 'out', 'prove', 'worthy', 'as', 'good', 'Christian', 'someone', 'blessed', 'life', 'endeavors', 'godly', 'like', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'someone', 'just', 'blessed', 'prove', 'worth', 'world', 'prejudiced', 'How', 'faith', 'influence', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'find', 'theme', 'film', 'very', 'interesting', 'satisfying', 'Reasons', 'competition', 'vary', 'Abraham', 'girlfriend', 'really', 'Harold', 'race', 'when', 'questions', 'motivations', 'running', 'Can', 'ultimately', 'be', 'successful', 'life', 'even', 'fail', 'once', 'awhile', 'film', 'not', 'reflective', 'frenetic', 'American', 'jazz-age', 'rather', 'era', 'when', 'Europeans', 'just', 'felt', 'lucky', 'be', 'alive', 'world', 'conflagration', 'reasons', 'why', 'two', 'men', 'run', 'essence', 'film', 'also', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'contrast', 'way', 'Olympics', 'have', 'changed', '1924', 'today', 'ridiculous', 'overexpansion', 'vast', 'expense', 'prefer', '1924', 'version.I', 'enjoy', 'film', 'many', 'levels', 'when', 'think', 'almost', 'won', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'have', 'laugh', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'surely', 'withstood', 'test', 'time', 'just', 'watched', 'again', 'last', 'week', 'Reds', 'LONG', 'BORING', 'film', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'no', 'longer', 'matter.Vangelis', 'score', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'As', 'much', 'main', 'theme', 'was', 'overplayed', '80s', 'still', 'beautiful', 'want', 'put', 'Nikes', 'head', 'track', 'even', 'have', 'never', 'run', 'life', 'music', 'not', 'express', 'jazz', 'age', 'rather', 'exhilaration', 'running', 'hair', 'trailing', 'own', 'slip', 'stream', 'stride', 'seashore', 'film', 'plot', 'even', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'evocation', 'era', 'very', 'sweet', 'indeed']",N/A

Rocky Balboa fought to prove something. Lou Gehrig wanted to persevere. Rudy Ruettiger just wanted to play for Notre Dame. They have obstacles, and by sheer will, overcome them.Not Eric Liddell. Liddell wanted to glorify God. When he ran, he felt closer to God. When it came to winning, he wanted it to point toward God, not himself.When questioned about his commitment as a Christian, and to his intention to return as a missionary to China, he replied, ""I believe that God made me for a purpose. But He also made me fast, and when I run, I feel His pleasure."" ""Chariots of Fire"" shows him as a man who never compromised, and followed through as an athlete who happened to be a Christian.The movie contrasts Liddell against the various concerns of others. Some ran for country, others ran for their king. Some ran for the good name of their school. Others ran so that they themselves would receive honor.Parallel to Liddell's Olympic chase is the story of Harold Abrahams, another English runner who faces quiet prejudice as a Jew from a blue color background. Abrahams worked as hard as Liddell, but his commitment was for himself. This distinction flowed in and out of various scenes.In a time when devotion to God is not considered fashionable, Liddell refused to change his position. His faith is not made an issue -- it is nice to see a movie that does not rest in snarkish cynicism, but tolerates Liddell's faith without whitewashing it.Aspects of the movie are fictionalized, but the essence is accurate. The filming is beautiful, and the acting solid. The music is well known, and strong throughout.The title refers to a line in William Blake's poem, ""And Did Those Feet in Ancient Time,"" which, itself refers to Elijah's chariot as mentioned in 2 Kings 2:11.I fully recommend ""Chariots of Fire.""Anthony Trendl[...]",5,"Inspiring Story of Commitment, Faith and Glory",1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,1905,"['Many', 'great', 'sports', 'movies', 'are', 'self-sacrifice', 'sake', 'selfish', 'goals', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'fought', 'prove', 'something', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'wanted', 'persevere', 'Rudy', 'Ruettiger', 'just', 'wanted', 'play', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'have', 'obstacles', 'sheer', 'will', 'overcome', 'them.Not', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'Liddell', 'wanted', 'glorify', 'God', 'When', 'ran', 'felt', 'closer', 'God', 'When', 'came', 'winning', 'wanted', 'point', 'God', 'not', 'himself.When', 'questioned', 'commitment', 'Christian', 'intention', 'return', 'missionary', 'China', 'replied', 'believe', 'God', 'made', 'purpose', 'also', 'made', 'fast', 'when', 'run', 'feel', 'pleasure', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'compromised', 'followed', 'athlete', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'Christian.The', 'movie', 'contrasts', 'Liddell', 'various', 'concerns', 'others', 'ran', 'country', 'others', 'ran', 'king', 'ran', 'good', 'name', 'school', 'Others', 'ran', 'so', 'would', 'receive', 'honor.Parallel', 'Liddell', 'Olympic', 'chase', 'story', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'English', 'runner', 'who', 'quiet', 'prejudice', 'Jew', 'blue', 'color', 'background', 'Abrahams', 'worked', 'as', 'hard', 'Liddell', 'commitment', 'was', 'distinction', 'flowed', 'various', 'scenes.In', 'time', 'when', 'devotion', 'God', 'not', 'considered', 'fashionable', 'Liddell', 'refused', 'change', 'position', 'faith', 'not', 'made', 'issue', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'rest', 'snarkish', 'cynicism', 'Liddell', 'faith', 'whitewashing', 'it.Aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'fictionalized', 'essence', 'accurate', 'filming', 'beautiful', 'acting', 'solid', 'music', 'well', 'known', 'strong', 'throughout.The', 'title', 'refers', 'line', 'William', 'Blake', 'poem', 'Did', 'Feet', 'Ancient', 'Time', 'refers', 'Elijah', 'chariot', 'mentioned', '2', 'Kings', '2:11.I', 'fully', 'recommend', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'Anthony', 'Trendl', '[', ']']",N/A

The introduction, which I absolutely love, is exactly the thought of what Chariots of Fire means. A very few of films have the distinction of being described as one of the most beautiful films made, and Chariots of Fire, without a doubt, is one of them. The acting is unbelievably good, and so is the direction. Chariots of Fire is not about the story itself but the nature of the human spirit. Everything else was secondary. Again, the introduction of the runners on the beach in a slow motion is the vivid description of that spirit. Why the picture triumphed over Raiders of the Lost Ark is because nobody could do what Hugh Hudson did with Chariots of Fire. Yes, Raiders of the Lost Ark was a unique picture, but Chariots of Fire is much more a unique picture, focusing solely on the humanistic spirit instead of becoming engulfed by the story. That's why Chariots of Fire stands the test of time and will remain so. Those who found Chariots of Fire otherwise do not know movies very well and are encouraged to watch at least a thousand of pictures before looking Chariots of Fire again. The same goes for 2001: A Space Odyssey. Both films offer similar experience but different directions. Furthermore of Chariots of Fire, the writing is exquisitely done, and I loved the cinematography. When I think about Chariots of Fire, I think about the introduction.

I did. I really did. Runners are not like football players, after all; they are lean and strong and frankly just the sort of men I appreciate most. There's a lot to appreciate here, at any number of levels.I suppose you know the basic story: two runners who go to the 1924 Olympics in Paris on the British team. They are not just runners, of course, but complex people with interesting lives. The movie goes deep into how their whole lifetimes fed into their excellence and their ability to bring home a couple of [SPOILER ALERT!] gold medals from Paris.Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) is an upper middle-class Jew who is very sensitive to all the anti-Semitism he has experienced all his life. Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) is a Scot who has returned from a mission in China, and expects to return when he's gotten his education. And his gold medal. He's so devout that he refuses to run a race on Sunday, requiring quite a clever solution on the part of his friend Lord Lindsay (Nicholas Farrell). Lindsay is a steeplechase runner who trained on his own estate by having his butler put a full glass of champagne on the end of every hurdle.

The setting, the actors, and the plot are incomparable. However, what I treasure the most are the values intrinsic to the tale. How often does film concern infidelity, murder, hatred, deceit or the pathological need to dominate others? Well over 80 percent of the time I would guess, but here, in this masterwork, man is depicted at his finest. In Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell, we are presented with exemplars of our species. These are the adults you dreamed of being when you were a small child. Their lives showcase a grandeur seldom seen in our own.The film is set in the years immediately following the first world war, when feelings of grief and despair were ubiquitous. Upon their arrival at Cambridge, Abrahams and Montague are assisted by two former wounded soldiers, and one of them could best be described as ""mutilated."" Such a fate, the two young athletes were quite lucky not to have shared.Societies that experienced the caldrons of the Somme and Paschendale were not as quick to dismiss the existence of God as we are today with our spoiled affluence and inflated life expectancies. To be saved from the carnage raging around you is not something to take lightly. Given the solemnity of their era, the seriousness and devotion integral to Liddell and Abrahams is not surprising. Competition was undertaken for more important reasons than money or fame.Eric Liddell eventually concludes that missionary work in China will have to wait until he fulfills his athletic promise. He believes that God did not give out gifts without a purpose. The Lord's intention was that what Liddell was given must be used. Eric felt ""God's pride"" as he ran and never forgot who gave him the power he possessed. A decision that would mean nothing to most of us (running on the Sabbath) is not one he can even consider undertaking. For Liddell, God must come before country, king, and personal glory.For Abrahams, his drive stems from the alienation he feels from being a Jewish outsider in Christian England. His goal was to ""run them off their feet"" and conquer who he views to be his oppressors. He does not run for pleasure; he competes only to win. His story is quite compelling. Abrahams' relationship with his coach, the also alienated Sam Mussabini, is intense and the bonds between them are nearly familial.

Sadly, it reminds us of a time when men understood there was something more important in this world than themselves. A time when such modern day concepts as compromise and personal gain had nothing to do with what was right and honorable.The story takes place in the early years of the twentieth century leading up to the 1924 Olympics in Paris. The storyline revolves around two young men from Great Britian, Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) and Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross). Both share their love for running in common, but the reasons why they run are quite different.Eric Liddell is a Scot and a devout Christian missionary from a missionary family. He has no personal ambitions nor desire for fame and glory, at least not for himself. He races because he feels ""God's pleasure"" when he is running. He believes that he is honoring God in his performance and hopes to win in Paris to show the world what you can accomplish if you have faith.For Harold Abrahams it's a more personal issue. Born in England of Jewish immigrants, he runs to bring honor to his family and heritage. He believes he has been marginalized by English society because of his semitic background and hopes to overcome this feeling of inferiority by becoming the fastest runner in the world. Only then will he feel he truly belongs.Two rivals with two very different reasons for pushing themselves towards their ultimate goal, an Olympic gold metal. The lessons they learn while competing on and off the race track become invaluable lessons in life as well.'Chariots of Fire' is one of my all-time top ten films. An absolutely flawless production that takes you back to a simpler, more innocent time and place that now exists only in the memories of the very old who were fortunate enough to experience it for themselves. The music of Vangelis' provides the perfect compliment to this Academy Award winning movie.",5,"For God, Country And Family  ~  The Art of Running And Living",1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,1991,"[""'Chariots"", 'Fire', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'poetic', 'inspiring', 'nostalgic', 'memorable', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Sadly', 'time', 'when', 'men', 'understood', 'was', 'something', 'more', 'important', 'world', 'time', 'when', 'such', 'modern', 'day', 'concepts', 'compromise', 'personal', 'gain', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'what', 'was', 'right', 'honorable.The', 'story', 'place', 'early', 'years', 'twentieth', 'century', 'leading', 'up', '1924', 'Olympics', 'Paris', 'storyline', 'revolves', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'Great', 'Britian', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'share', 'love', 'running', 'common', 'reasons', 'why', 'run', 'are', 'quite', 'different.Eric', 'Liddell', 'Scot', 'devout', 'Christian', 'missionary', 'missionary', 'family', 'personal', 'ambitions', 'desire', 'fame', 'glory', 'least', 'not', 'God', 'pleasure', 'when', 'running', 'honoring', 'God', 'performance', 'win', 'Paris', 'show', 'world', 'what', 'can', 'accomplish', 'have', 'faith.For', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'more', 'personal', 'issue', 'Born', 'England', 'Jewish', 'immigrants', 'bring', 'honor', 'family', 'heritage', 'been', 'marginalized', 'English', 'society', 'semitic', 'background', 'overcome', 'feeling', 'inferiority', 'becoming', 'fastest', 'runner', 'world', 'Only', 'then', 'will', 'feel', 'truly', 'belongs.Two', 'rivals', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'reasons', 'pushing', 'towards', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'Olympic', 'gold', 'metal', 'lessons', 'learn', 'competing', 'race', 'track', 'become', 'invaluable', 'lessons', 'life', 'as', 'well', ""'Chariots"", 'Fire', 'one', 'all-time', 'top', 'ten', 'films', 'absolutely', 'flawless', 'production', 'back', 'simpler', 'more', 'innocent', 'time', 'place', 'now', 'only', 'memories', 'very', 'old', 'who', 'were', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'experience', 'music', 'Vangelis', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'movie']",N/A
94825,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,0790731010,Char,"[1, 1]","Eric Liddell's life has been described as an example of someone who lived out the Olympic ideals of ""Citius, Altius, Fortius,"" or, """"Swifter, Higher, Stronger.""The movie Chariots of Fire focuses upon a key choice in Liddell's history when, because he was committed to living out God's Commandment requiring that the Sabbath Day be kept Holy unto the Lord, he firmly declined to run the 100m heat for which he had prepared in the Paris Olympics of 1924.  This was a decidedly unpopular decision with the general public.  Eric took on, instead, the 400m.  As he stepped into place for the race, an American athlete (who would later become a missionary) handed him a piece of paper on which were written the words of 1 Samuel 2:30, ""Those who honor Me, I will honor.""  Liddell won the gold metal for the 400m.  He also won the bronze for the 100m.Anyone who wants or needs inspiration for running life's race wholeheartedly has an opportunity to watch and catch Fire from Eric Liddell's racing scenes as recreated in the enduring classic, CHARIOTS OF FIRE, especially the race of Scotland-France of 1923 in which he falls but gets up to run again, winning despite lost time.  Harry Abrams afterwards observes that he's never seen such commitment in a runner.This race also illustrates a peculiar trait of Liddell's whereby at a certain all-out point in the race he would put back his head and run with his mouth open.Abrams' history as shown in the film is inspiring and honorable, as well as Liddell's, and not less heartwarming are the scenes about Harry Abram's dedicated training and ardent running.  The part of Harry Abrams I felt was particularly well-acted.To my taste, this is a beautiful and excellent movie in many ways.  All the actors do a splendid job.  The film is tastefully done.  The soundtrack music with its distant summoning horns always holds the ability to mysteriously stir one's blood, calling one to rise up and ""run"" heaven-knows-where, and gladly.One of my favorite scenes is near the beginning of the story when, at an opening-of-college dinner in 1919, the Master of the college laments the passing in the recent war of the ""flower of a generation.""  He calls this lost generation the glory of England and all it stands for.  Therefore, urges the Master, ""Let me exhort you.  Let each of you discover where your true chance of greatness lies.  For the sake of your college and your country, seize this chance.  Rejoice in it, and let no power or persuasion deter you in your task.""  It's a noble and deeply serious speech, but it must be seen ultimately as an ironic prefiguring of Eric Liddell's choice to honor the King of Heaven over and above ""King and Country.""Another of my favorite scenes is where Eric offers a small gathered group of people following the Scotland vs Ireland race his request of them that they not just watch the race, but that they take part in it, and he compares Faith to running in a race.  ""It's hard.  Requires concentration of will, energy of soul.""  He says that everyone runs his race in his own way and that he can't give exact instructions as to how each must run his race.  He does give his insight for how to get the FIRE that is needed to run the race to the end.  It comes from Within, because the Kingdom of God is Within.  He bespeaks asking and seeking God, and he ends on the note of total commitment.  The speech is an index for the motives of Liddell's entire life's race.It is said that at the core of his life, Eric believed that God was his savior, friend and companion and that everything he did should give God pleasure.  He loved to run because he felt that his running made God happy!Eric Liddell went on to be a missionary and died, at last in 1941, in a Japanese prison.  An Eric Liddell web site on-line gives evidence of the legacy of inspiration and works that continue to follow from the way that Eric chose to live his life.",5,"Whole Hearts, Winged Feet",1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,3911,"['Eric', 'Liddell', 'life', 'been', 'described', 'example', 'someone', 'who', 'lived', 'out', 'Olympic', 'ideals', 'Citius', 'Altius', 'Fortius', 'Swifter', 'Higher', 'Stronger', 'movie', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'key', 'choice', 'Liddell', 'history', 'when', 'was', 'committed', 'living', 'out', 'God', 'Commandment', 'requiring', 'Sabbath', 'Day', 'be', 'kept', 'Holy', 'Lord', 'firmly', 'declined', 'run', '100m', 'heat', 'had', 'prepared', 'Paris', 'Olympics', '1924', 'was', 'decidedly', 'unpopular', 'decision', 'general', 'public', 'Eric', 'took', 'instead', '400m', 'stepped', 'place', 'race', 'American', 'athlete', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'missionary', 'handed', 'piece', 'paper', 'were', 'written', 'words', '1', 'Samuel', '2:30', 'who', 'honor', 'Me', 'will', 'honor', 'Liddell', 'won', 'gold', 'metal', '400m', 'also', 'won', 'bronze', '100m.Anyone', 'who', 'inspiration', 'running', 'life', 'race', 'wholeheartedly', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'catch', 'Fire', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'racing', 'scenes', 'recreated', 'enduring', 'classic', 'CHARIOTS', 'OF', 'FIRE', 'especially', 'race', 'Scotland-France', '1923', 'up', 'run', 'again', 'winning', 'lost', 'time', 'Harry', 'Abrams', 'afterwards', 'never', 'seen', 'such', 'commitment', 'runner.This', 'race', 'also', 'peculiar', 'trait', 'Liddell', 'whereby', 'certain', 'all-out', 'point', 'race', 'would', 'put', 'back', 'head', 'run', 'mouth', 'open.Abrams', 'history', 'shown', 'film', 'inspiring', 'honorable', 'as', 'well', 'Liddell', 'not', 'less', 'heartwarming', 'are', 'scenes', 'Harry', 'Abram', 'dedicated', 'training', 'ardent', 'running', 'part', 'Harry', 'Abrams', 'felt', 'was', 'particularly', 'well-acted.To', 'taste', 'beautiful', 'excellent', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'actors', 'do', 'splendid', 'job', 'film', 'tastefully', 'done', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'distant', 'summoning', 'horns', 'always', 'ability', 'mysteriously', 'stir', 'one', 'blood', 'calling', 'one', 'rise', 'up', 'run', 'heaven-knows-where', 'gladly.One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'story', 'when', 'opening-of-college', 'dinner', '1919', 'Master', 'college', 'passing', 'recent', 'war', 'flower', 'generation', 'lost', 'generation', 'glory', 'England', 'Therefore', 'Master', 'Let', 'exhort', 'Let', 'discover', 'where', 'true', 'chance', 'greatness', 'lies', 'sake', 'college', 'country', 'seize', 'chance', 'Rejoice', 'let', 'power', 'persuasion', 'deter', 'task', 'noble', 'deeply', 'serious', 'speech', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'ultimately', 'ironic', 'prefiguring', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'choice', 'honor', 'King', 'Heaven', 'King', 'Country', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'where', 'Eric', 'small', 'gathered', 'group', 'people', 'following', 'Scotland', 'vs', 'Ireland', 'race', 'request', 'not', 'just', 'watch', 'race', 'take', 'part', 'Faith', 'running', 'race', 'hard', 'Requires', 'concentration', 'will', 'energy', 'soul', 'everyone', 'race', 'own', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'exact', 'instructions', 'how', 'must', 'run', 'race', 'give', 'insight', 'how', 'get', 'FIRE', 'needed', 'run', 'race', 'end', 'Within', 'Kingdom', 'God', 'Within', 'asking', 'seeking', 'God', 'note', 'total', 'commitment', 'speech', 'index', 'motives', 'Liddell', 'entire', 'life', 'race.It', 'said', 'core', 'life', 'Eric', 'believed', 'God', 'was', 'savior', 'friend', 'companion', 'everything', 'did', 'should', 'give', 'God', 'pleasure', 'loved', 'run', 'felt', 'running', 'made', 'God', 'happy', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'went', 'be', 'missionary', 'died', 'last', '1941', 'Japanese', 'prison', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'site', 'on-line', 'evidence', 'legacy', 'inspiration', 'continue', 'follow', 'way', 'Eric', 'chose', 'live', 'life']",N/A
94826,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,0790731010,Christopher Culver,"[1, 2]","CHARIOTS OF FIRE is a film about athletic motivation inspired by two English figures from the 1924 Paris Olympics. Eric Lidell (Ian Charleson), born in China to Scottish missionaries, runs ultimately to glorify God. The Jewish runner Harold Abrahams (Ian Cross) does to overcome anti-Semitism and his family's immigrant background. The film tracks the development of their careers as Lidell tries to reconcile his prowess and his faith, while Abrahams studies at Cambridge and works with coach Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm). Abrahams' classmates and Lidell's devout sister are also major figures in the film.The story of these athletes is told in a generally entertaining fashion, but CHARIOTS OF FIRE has some weaknesses. Even before one knows the history behind the film, one can tell where the screenwriters have added material to make it fit Hollywood norms (e.g. Abrahams' relationship with an actress), and the film has unimaginative cinematography. In spite of the grand reception given to CHARIOTS OF FIRE upon its release, including multiple awards, it seems to me today as a mere movie to be rather fluff. But the real value in the film for me is that it spurred me on to read more about the figures and events mentioned in the movie. The generation of these athletes is a fascinating one. They watched fathers and older brothers die in World War I, competed in much less commercial athletic events than today, and were a sort of Renaissance men combining athletic prowess and rigorous traditional schooling.Various versions of the film exist. I haven't seen the two-disc special edition that is offered here nowadays, but I imagine it's only an improvement over the first DVD release, which was a low-quality print and pan and scan.",3,"Entertaining, but the film is ultimately less memorable than the historical writings it spurs you on to",1277164800,"06 22, 2010",2010,1738,"['CHARIOTS', 'OF', 'FIRE', 'film', 'athletic', 'motivation', 'inspired', 'two', 'English', 'figures', '1924', 'Paris', 'Olympics', 'Eric', 'Lidell', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'born', 'China', 'Scottish', 'missionaries', 'ultimately', 'glorify', 'God', 'Jewish', 'runner', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'Ian', 'Cross', 'overcome', 'anti-Semitism', 'family', 'immigrant', 'background', 'film', 'development', 'careers', 'Lidell', 'reconcile', 'prowess', 'faith', 'Abrahams', 'studies', 'Cambridge', 'coach', 'Sam', 'Mussabini', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Abrahams', 'classmates', 'Lidell', 'devout', 'sister', 'are', 'also', 'major', 'figures', 'film.The', 'story', 'athletes', 'told', 'generally', 'entertaining', 'fashion', 'CHARIOTS', 'OF', 'FIRE', 'weaknesses', 'Even', 'one', 'history', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'where', 'screenwriters', 'have', 'added', 'material', 'make', 'fit', 'Hollywood', 'norms', 'e.g', 'Abrahams', 'relationship', 'actress', 'film', 'unimaginative', 'cinematography', 'spite', 'grand', 'reception', 'given', 'CHARIOTS', 'OF', 'FIRE', 'release', 'including', 'multiple', 'awards', 'today', 'mere', 'movie', 'be', 'rather', 'fluff', 'real', 'value', 'film', 'spurred', 'read', 'more', 'figures', 'events', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'generation', 'athletes', 'fascinating', 'one', 'watched', 'fathers', 'older', 'brothers', 'die', 'World', 'War', 'competed', 'much', 'less', 'commercial', 'athletic', 'events', 'today', 'were', 'sort', 'Renaissance', 'men', 'combining', 'athletic', 'prowess', 'rigorous', 'traditional', 'schooling.Various', 'versions', 'film', 'exist', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'two-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'offered', 'here', 'nowadays', 'imagine', 'only', 'improvement', 'first', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'low-quality', 'print', 'pan', 'scan']",N/A

Their success will win honor for their nation - but for two champion runners, the honor at stake is a personal one...and their challenge one from within.Chariots Of fire tells the exciting, inspiring true story of Harold Abrahams, Eric Liddell, and the dedicated team of competitors who brought Great Britain one of her most legendary victories in international sports. It is also the film that marked the brilliant resurgence of the British movie industry - and won four 1981 Academy Awards - including Best Picture.Virtually a succession of smashing debuts, which it proved to be for Ben Cross, Ian Charleson, Nigel Havers, Nicholas Farrell, Alice Krige, Jeremy Sinden, and Daniel Gerroll in their first major film roles, and Hugh Hudson (a veteran of British Television)directing his first theatrical feature. With such other wonderful talents by veteran actors Sir Ian Holm, Sir John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson, and Nigel Davenport, the collective people together shaped a film whose impact is still lasting and unique. From its bracing footage of competition and pagentry, to the haunting image of the English runners on the beach, to the extraordinary music score by Vangelis, Chariots Of Fire has left its mark on film fans everywhere. It also has proven that British filmmakers and film crews are the best, and only the best, in the world.If you are looking for the finest in entertainment, art films, or otherwise, you need not look any furthur than Chariots Of Fire.

94828,A3P876I6K3KL8V,0790731010,C. Long,"[3, 4]","This movie has long been heralded in many Christian circles since its release in 1981. Though I am not nearly as enthusiastic about it as some are, I do feel it has some worthwhile things to say and it is a very well-made, albeit ""artsy"", movie.This is a very British film that is based on true events that showcases two different British track stars: one is Eric Liddell, a strong Christian who is also a missionary, and Harold Abrahams, a Jew. Harold is shown to be Jew more as ethnicity rather than as His religion - in other words he is not really shown to be practicing or believing in the Jewish faith. In fact, he is shown to be quite confused about life and his role in it. He is portrayed as running to try to prove himself (for others, but even more so FOR himself). He also feels that he has been the subject of discrimination from others in the name of Christianity. Eric Liddell, on the other hand, runs not to prove himself or bring himself fame, but to bring God glory. He truly believes that God has gifted him with a gift and He wants to use that gift to bring God glory. The difference in motivations between these two men is very clear, and yet, I must say that the movie actually seems to portray both of them, and both of their motivations, in a positive light. There is a point towards the end where Harold seems to realize the futility in banking the purpose of his life on winning a medal, and yet, the film goes on to seemingly show him okay with that.A key part of the movie concerns Eric Liddell refusing to run a certain race because it occurs on a Sunday and he believes that running on the Sabbath would be wrong. He holds his ground and stands courageously for his beliefs. Now many Christians would take issue with that actually being wrong (myself included) but he didn't and therefore as a matter of conscience, he held to his convictions.This portrayal of bold Christianity, as well as the difference in motivations behind the runners, I believe makes this a worthwhile film for Christians - especially if there is follow-up discussion among family members/group, etc. after watching. This movie can be great to spearhead talking about things such as giftings that God gives and how we are to use them and who gets the glory, the futility of banking our lives on fame/winning a medal/proving ourselves, whether Eric was correct in his belief regarding the Sabbath (look up Scripture), the importance of standing for what you believe in (not violating your conscience) even when pressured to do so, etc.I strongly recommend the Blu-Ray of this film over the DVD - the quality improvement is definitely worth it. As a film, this is a rather slow-moving and not particularly exciting film by today's standards. You could think of it more like a visual documentary of sorts and you'd be in the ballpark. This, combined with the very 1920's British feel, will mean that many (I would even say most) children will be bored out of their mind with this movie. This is one more for adults. I can tell you that I saw it when I was about 16 and thought it quite boring then, and it is only now as an adult that I have a greater appreciation for it.Chris LongMoviesForChristians Movie Reviewsmoviesforchristians dot org",4,Good movie for Christians,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,3242,"['movie', 'long', 'been', 'heralded', 'many', 'Christian', 'circles', 'release', '1981', 'am', 'not', 'nearly', 'enthusiastic', 'are', 'do', 'feel', 'worthwhile', 'things', 'say', 'very', 'well-made', 'artsy', 'movie.This', 'very', 'British', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'two', 'different', 'British', 'track', 'stars', 'one', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'strong', 'Christian', 'who', 'also', 'missionary', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'Jew', 'Harold', 'shown', 'be', 'Jew', 'more', 'ethnicity', 'rather', 'religion', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'really', 'shown', 'be', 'practicing', 'believing', 'Jewish', 'faith', 'fact', 'shown', 'be', 'quite', 'confused', 'life', 'role', 'portrayed', 'running', 'try', 'prove', 'others', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'FOR', 'also', 'been', 'subject', 'discrimination', 'others', 'name', 'Christianity', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'prove', 'bring', 'fame', 'bring', 'God', 'glory', 'truly', 'God', 'gifted', 'gift', 'use', 'gift', 'bring', 'God', 'glory', 'difference', 'motivations', 'two', 'men', 'very', 'clear', 'yet', 'must', 'say', 'movie', 'actually', 'portray', 'motivations', 'positive', 'light', 'point', 'end', 'where', 'Harold', 'realize', 'futility', 'banking', 'purpose', 'life', 'winning', 'medal', 'yet', 'film', 'seemingly', 'show', 'okay', 'that.A', 'key', 'part', 'movie', 'concerns', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'refusing', 'run', 'certain', 'race', 'Sunday', 'running', 'Sabbath', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'ground', 'courageously', 'beliefs', 'Now', 'many', 'Christians', 'would', 'take', 'issue', 'actually', 'being', 'wrong', 'included', 'did', ""n't"", 'therefore', 'matter', 'conscience', 'held', 'convictions.This', 'portrayal', 'bold', 'Christianity', 'as', 'well', 'difference', 'motivations', 'runners', 'believe', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'Christians', 'especially', 'follow-up', 'discussion', 'family', 'members/group', 'etc', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'spearhead', 'talking', 'things', 'such', 'giftings', 'God', 'how', 'are', 'use', 'who', 'glory', 'futility', 'banking', 'lives', 'fame/winning', 'medal/proving', 'Eric', 'was', 'correct', 'belief', 'regarding', 'Sabbath', 'look', 'up', 'Scripture', 'importance', 'standing', 'what', 'believe', 'not', 'violating', 'conscience', 'even', 'when', 'pressured', 'do', 'so', 'etc.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'Blu-Ray', 'film', 'DVD', 'quality', 'improvement', 'definitely', 'worth', 'film', 'rather', 'slow-moving', 'not', 'particularly', 'exciting', 'film', 'today', 'standards', 'could', 'think', 'more', 'visual', 'documentary', 'sorts', ""'d"", 'be', 'ballpark', 'combined', 'very', '1920', 'British', 'feel', 'will', 'mean', 'many', 'would', 'even', 'say', 'most', 'children', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'mind', 'movie', 'one', 'more', 'adults', 'can', 'tell', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'about', '16', 'thought', 'quite', 'boring', 'then', 'only', 'now', 'adult', 'have', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'it.Chris', 'LongMoviesForChristians', 'Movie', 'Reviewsmoviesforchristians', 'dot', 'org']",N/A

He is Hebrew in a Christian world son to a financier.  He enrolls a coach named Mr. Masanbini who admits he can't put in what god left out but none the less agrees to train the young Ben.The second major character is Eric Liddell of Scotland he grew up in China as the son of a missonary.  He is Christian through and through but besides that he runs like the wind.  Despite a calling to take up the missionary he decides to participate in the Olympics for England and Scotland.This movie is epic it has little comparisons in my mind and is something that makes me shiver.  It is inspiring and I can remember watching it hundreds of times over the years.  The movie is complemented by an amazing soundtrack by Vangelis who also did Bladerunner.  This movie describes a period when England and the world were in the shadow of what may have been the most horrific war man has ever seen and from this shadow a few of Englands brightest young men shone inspiring not only their nation but the world.

Well, the second half of the film and then subsequent viewings have done more than just answer my question.It's one of the RARE movies in the past 30 years which portrays a Christian in a positive light. Ian Charleson does a convincing job of portraying a 100 percent sincerely good man who walks the talk.In here is also a good portrayal of a Jewish man, a student at Cambridge, acted well by Ben Cross. This man is too defensive about being Jewish and carries a chip on his shoulder until the end where he comes out a hero and a fine man as well, the bitterness gone.The story of those two men and their quest for a gold medal at the 1924 Olympics in France makes for an inspiring film. It's also aided by very nice photography and a wonderful score by Vangelis. A recently-issued widescreen DVD finally shows off the award-winning cinematography. The feel- good ending doesn't hurt, either, especially since these main characters were real-life people.Her extraordinary beauty made Alice Krige an interesting person to watch in the film, and I wonder why she never made it as a ""big-name"" actress.

Blu-Ray book edition, feels like a collector's edition. I liken this to another excellent edition - Amadeus. Simply because, not only it feels like an embossed hard cover book, but it also contains a CD sampler of the soundtrack. Although I prefer all the tracks from soundtrack to be included at this price range, but I will make do with what we have. At least Warner had enough sense to include the fabulous title track.Picture quality of this Blu-Ray is pristine. Even though this film is more than 30 years old, it still feels as if it were filmed recently. The remastering is quite impressive. I'm not quite an audiophile but when the title track starts seeping in through the speakers as the runners pound the soft sound on the shoreline, one would be awash with nostalgia! I guess Vangelis' Oscar winning track is certainly timeless in that sense!The film itself is quite understated. Many would feel it being overrated due to its Oscar wins, but taking in on face value, it is more of an odyssey and the rivalry between two very dissimilar but yet somewhat familiar individuals. Both are driven to win for different purposes. Abrahams, played by Ben Cross, fights against discrimination due to his Jewish heritage and it seems to be a lifelong obsession that he be seen as an Englishman rather than an overachieving Jewish lawyer. Liddel, played by the brilliant late Ian Charleson, is the personification of God's right hand of vengeance who 'smites' down upon those who dare challenge him. Short of fire and brimstone, Liddel ensures that his godly gift of speed is utilised in the right manner on the running tracks. His refusal to run on a Sunday comes across certainly as a little high-handed with a theological bent thrown in.Hugh Hudson intercuts dramatic scenes with slow-motion sequences of various characters in their pivotal races. Played to the electronic sound of Vangelis, the sequences are both riveting and immersive. As to whether Hudson deserves to win on Oscar night, I would say that he edges over Warren Beatty on a slight margin. Beatty's 'Reds' is a little too unwieldy and lengthy for my taste. Chariots of Fire certainly deserves the Best Picture win. Although Ian Charleson should at least have garnered a nomination for his uncanny portrayal of a racing clergyman.",5,Inspiring and Triumph of the Human Spirit,1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,2415,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'review', 'Blu-Ray', 'book', 'edition', 'fine', 'film', 'book', 'many', 'other', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'Blu-Ray', 'book', 'edition', 'feels', 'collector', 'edition', 'liken', 'excellent', 'edition', 'Amadeus', 'Simply', 'not', 'only', 'embossed', 'hard', 'cover', 'book', 'also', 'CD', 'sampler', 'soundtrack', 'prefer', 'tracks', 'soundtrack', 'be', 'included', 'price', 'range', 'will', 'make', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'least', 'Warner', 'had', 'enough', 'sense', 'include', 'fabulous', 'title', 'track.Picture', 'quality', 'Blu-Ray', 'pristine', 'Even', 'film', 'more', '30', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'were', 'filmed', 'recently', 'remastering', 'quite', 'impressive', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'audiophile', 'when', 'title', 'track', 'seeping', 'speakers', 'runners', 'pound', 'soft', 'sound', 'shoreline', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'awash', 'nostalgia', 'guess', 'Vangelis', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'track', 'certainly', 'timeless', 'sense', 'film', 'quite', 'understated', 'Many', 'would', 'feel', 'being', 'overrated', 'due', 'Oscar', 'wins', 'taking', 'face', 'value', 'more', 'odyssey', 'rivalry', 'two', 'very', 'dissimilar', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'familiar', 'individuals', 'are', 'driven', 'win', 'different', 'purposes', 'Abrahams', 'played', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'fights', 'discrimination', 'due', 'Jewish', 'heritage', 'be', 'lifelong', 'obsession', 'be', 'seen', 'Englishman', 'rather', 'overachieving', 'Jewish', 'lawyer', 'Liddel', 'played', 'brilliant', 'late', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'personification', 'God', 'right', 'hand', 'vengeance', 'who', 'down', 'who', 'dare', 'challenge', 'Short', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'Liddel', 'godly', 'gift', 'speed', 'utilised', 'right', 'manner', 'running', 'tracks', 'refusal', 'run', 'Sunday', 'across', 'certainly', 'little', 'high-handed', 'theological', 'bent', 'thrown', 'in.Hugh', 'Hudson', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'slow-motion', 'sequences', 'various', 'characters', 'pivotal', 'races', 'Played', 'electronic', 'sound', 'Vangelis', 'sequences', 'are', 'riveting', 'immersive', 'Hudson', 'win', 'Oscar', 'night', 'would', 'say', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'slight', 'margin', 'Beatty', ""'Reds"", 'little', 'too', 'unwieldy', 'lengthy', 'taste', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'certainly', 'Best', 'Picture', 'win', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'should', 'least', 'have', 'garnered', 'nomination', 'uncanny', 'portrayal', 'racing', 'clergyman']",N/A

Hamlow,"[104, 111]","The athletes of the British running team who went with hope in their hearts and wings in their heels in the VIII Olympiad in Paris in 1924 is the focus of this movie, but there's also the dynamics of what it means to be English, and the reconciliation of one's soul and religious convictions in the Modern Age.  Three of them are students from Cambridge. There is the quiet and soft-spoken Aubrey Montague, Lord Andrew Lindsey, and Harold Abrahams.  As the head of Caius (pronounced Keys) College tells them when they first attend in 1919, they are the first post-war generation who have inherited the dreams of a generation that perished on the fields of France, a generation embodying ""goodness, zeal,...and intellectual promise.""The two main athletes here are a contrast from one another.  One is Harold Abrahams, a Jew who wants to be seen as English as the fellow next to him.  Hence his enrolling in all these clubs and fraternities in Caius College, from track, tennis, and even the Gilbert and Sullivan glee club-he wants to enter the Christian, Anglo-Saxon corridors of power, i.e. the old school tie.  He succeeds in getting to an English girl in the form of Sybil Gordon, who doesn't mind he's Jewish.  He can run like the wind, and nothing would fulfill his dream of being English more than winning so he'll be accepted, but he's so driven, hinging so much of his success on his winning, that he acts like its his own funeral when he loses in a race.  He engages Sam Mussabini, a private and professional coach, which is contrary to the implied rules of Cambridge.  When the heads of Trinity House and Caius House, (Sir John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson) use their prep-school mentality to chastise him, saying Cambridge prided itself on the amateur attitude as opposed to the professional, and an esprit de Corps as opposed to individual glory, Abrahams tells them off.Scottish Eric Liddle, on the other hand, is a missionary born in China, who plans to return there to continue God's work, but the ""muscular Christian"" runs like a wild animal.  With religion as a metaphor, he compares faith to running a race, describing the energy of the soul, the elation of breaking that tape, but he says that the power comes from within.  ""If you commit yourself to the love of Jesus Christ-that is how you win a straight race.""  To win is to honour God, and the gift he was given.  His faith is tested twice, between the missionary work and running, and his respect for God and running on the Sabbath.  He's clearly more Victorian, but also a Scot, choosing God over country instead of the more secular British. But will his faith help him triumph over favoured Americans Jackson Scholz and Charles Paddock?The slow-mo shots of the running athletes, the looks of elation, the disappointment of those who didn't qualify shows the various reactions of the soul.  And New Age composer Vangelis Pathaniossou made his mark with his score, during the races and the scenes of Americans training, but especially the moving main theme that opens and closes the movie as the athletes are running along the ocean shore.  This sequence itself is repeated twice, once where we know nothing about these athletes on who the cameras pan in on, but by the end, when the camera does its work, we know these people better, and they have names, as the credits identify actor and role.  This was an early role for Nicholas Farrell (Montague), who was Horatio in Branagh's Hamlet.  But Ben Cross as the driven Abrahams, Ian Charleson as the debonair blond Christian Liddell, Nigel Havers as Lindsay, Ian Holm (Mussabini), and Alice Krige (Sybil)  do well.  And yes, the Head Porter at Caius College is Richard Griffiths, best known as Harry Potter's Uncle Vernon, and quite thinner too.As the winner of four Oscars including Best Picture, Chariots Of Fire remains an unpretentious film where the finish line is a moral, spiritual, and of course a physical goal, and how one must be true to oneself to reach that goal.",5,With hope in our hearts and wings in our heels!,1089158400,"07 7, 2004",2004,3999,"['athletes', 'British', 'running', 'team', 'who', 'went', 'hope', 'hearts', 'wings', 'heels', 'VIII', 'Olympiad', 'Paris', '1924', 'focus', 'movie', 'also', 'dynamics', 'what', 'be', 'English', 'reconciliation', 'one', 'soul', 'religious', 'convictions', 'Modern', 'Age', 'Three', 'are', 'students', 'Cambridge', 'quiet', 'soft-spoken', 'Aubrey', 'Montague', 'Lord', 'Andrew', 'Lindsey', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'head', 'Caius', 'pronounced', 'Keys', 'College', 'when', 'first', 'attend', '1919', 'are', 'first', 'post-war', 'generation', 'who', 'have', 'inherited', 'dreams', 'generation', 'perished', 'fields', 'France', 'generation', 'embodying', 'goodness', 'zeal', 'intellectual', 'promise', 'two', 'main', 'athletes', 'here', 'are', 'contrast', 'one', 'One', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'Jew', 'who', 'be', 'seen', 'as', 'English', 'fellow', 'next', 'Hence', 'enrolling', 'clubs', 'fraternities', 'Caius', 'College', 'track', 'tennis', 'even', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'glee', 'club-he', 'enter', 'Christian', 'Anglo-Saxon', 'corridors', 'power', 'i.e', 'old', 'school', 'tie', 'getting', 'English', 'girl', 'form', 'Sybil', 'Gordon', 'who', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Jewish', 'can', 'run', 'wind', 'nothing', 'would', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'being', 'English', 'more', 'winning', 'so', ""'ll"", 'be', 'accepted', 'so', 'driven', 'hinging', 'so', 'much', 'success', 'winning', 'own', 'funeral', 'when', 'race', 'Sam', 'Mussabini', 'private', 'professional', 'coach', 'contrary', 'implied', 'rules', 'Cambridge', 'When', 'heads', 'Trinity', 'House', 'Caius', 'House', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Lindsay', 'Anderson', 'use', 'prep-school', 'mentality', 'chastise', 'saying', 'Cambridge', 'prided', 'amateur', 'attitude', 'opposed', 'professional', 'esprit', 'de', 'Corps', 'opposed', 'individual', 'glory', 'Abrahams', 'off.Scottish', 'Eric', 'Liddle', 'other', 'hand', 'missionary', 'born', 'China', 'who', 'return', 'there', 'continue', 'God', 'work', 'muscular', 'Christian', 'wild', 'animal', 'religion', 'metaphor', 'faith', 'running', 'race', 'describing', 'energy', 'soul', 'elation', 'breaking', 'tape', 'power', 'commit', 'love', 'Jesus', 'Christ-that', 'how', 'win', 'straight', 'race', 'win', 'honour', 'God', 'gift', 'was', 'given', 'faith', 'tested', 'twice', 'missionary', 'work', 'running', 'respect', 'God', 'running', 'Sabbath', 'clearly', 'more', 'Victorian', 'also', 'Scot', 'choosing', 'God', 'country', 'instead', 'more', 'secular', 'British', 'will', 'faith', 'help', 'triumph', 'favoured', 'Americans', 'Jackson', 'Scholz', 'Charles', 'Paddock', 'slow-mo', 'shots', 'running', 'athletes', 'looks', 'elation', 'disappointment', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'qualify', 'various', 'reactions', 'soul', 'New', 'Age', 'composer', 'Vangelis', 'Pathaniossou', 'made', 'mark', 'score', 'races', 'scenes', 'Americans', 'training', 'especially', 'moving', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'athletes', 'are', 'running', 'ocean', 'shore', 'sequence', 'repeated', 'twice', 'once', 'where', 'know', 'nothing', 'athletes', 'who', 'cameras', 'pan', 'end', 'when', 'camera', 'work', 'know', 'people', 'better', 'have', 'names', 'credits', 'identify', 'actor', 'role', 'was', 'early', 'role', 'Nicholas', 'Farrell', 'Montague', 'who', 'was', 'Horatio', 'Branagh', 'Hamlet', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'driven', 'Abrahams', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'debonair', 'blond', 'Christian', 'Liddell', 'Nigel', 'Havers', 'Lindsay', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Mussabini', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'Sybil', 'do', 'well', 'yes', 'Head', 'Porter', 'Caius', 'College', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'best', 'known', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Uncle', 'Vernon', 'quite', 'thinner', 'winner', 'four', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'unpretentious', 'film', 'where', 'finish', 'line', 'moral', 'spiritual', 'course', 'physical', 'goal', 'how', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'true', 'oneself', 'reach', 'goal']",N/A
94837,A2YFQCTZEG2HQV,0790731010,David C. Roller,"[5, 5]","Mini Review of one of my top 10 favorite films of all time.Chariots of Fire is the excellent story of two  runners (Eric Liddell, portrayed by the late Ian Charleson and Harold Abrahams who is played by Ben Cross)in the 1924 Olympic Games.It is an understated epic showing the dichotomy of faith and self determination.  It is also two fine character studies of men blessed with as much courage and fire as they do athletic prowess.The overall effect of the film is inspirational.  The stories of these great men inspire me and I believe countless others to always live life to its utmost.  Two scenes stand out in my memory that illustrate this effect.The first takes place at a track meet between Scotland and France.  Liddell takes a bad spill in the 400 meters event and somehow manages to not only get back up but catch up with the field and win the race as  he falls to the ground utterly exhausted form his ordeal.When Sam Mussabini (Abrahams' Coach) comments &quot;It's not the prettiest 400 I've ever seen Liddell but it is certainly the bravest&quot; the audience is given words with which to process the exhilarating feat they just witnessed.The second scene takes place after Abrahams loses a race to Liddell.  Abrahams is devastated as he has never lost before.  He comments to his girl friend that he won't race of he can't win.  She counters back: &quot;You can't win if you don't race.&quot;Whether it be in words or pictures Chariots of Fire communicates to the viewer that life is a  race worth running  full out to the end.",5,Running the race set before you.,1086998400,"06 12, 2004",2004,1542,"['Mini', 'Review', 'one', 'top', '10', 'favorite', 'films', 'time.Chariots', 'Fire', 'excellent', 'story', 'two', 'runners', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'portrayed', 'late', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'who', 'played', 'Ben', 'Cross', '1924', 'Olympic', 'Games.It', 'understated', 'epic', 'showing', 'dichotomy', 'faith', 'self', 'determination', 'also', 'two', 'fine', 'character', 'studies', 'men', 'blessed', 'as', 'much', 'courage', 'fire', 'do', 'athletic', 'prowess.The', 'overall', 'effect', 'film', 'inspirational', 'stories', 'great', 'men', 'inspire', 'believe', 'countless', 'others', 'always', 'live', 'life', 'utmost', 'Two', 'scenes', 'stand', 'out', 'memory', 'illustrate', 'effect.The', 'first', 'place', 'track', 'meet', 'Scotland', 'France', 'Liddell', 'bad', 'spill', '400', 'meters', 'event', 'somehow', 'manages', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'back', 'up', 'catch', 'up', 'field', 'win', 'race', 'ground', 'utterly', 'exhausted', 'form', 'ordeal.When', 'Sam', 'Mussabini', 'Abrahams', 'Coach', 'comments', 'quot', 'not', 'prettiest', '400', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Liddell', 'certainly', 'bravest', 'quot', 'audience', 'given', 'words', 'process', 'exhilarating', 'feat', 'just', 'witnessed.The', 'second', 'scene', 'place', 'Abrahams', 'race', 'Liddell', 'Abrahams', 'devastated', 'never', 'lost', 'before', 'comments', 'girl', 'friend', 'wo', ""n't"", 'race', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'back', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'do', ""n't"", 'race.', 'quot', 'Whether', 'be', 'words', 'pictures', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'communicates', 'viewer', 'life', 'race', 'worth', 'running', 'full', 'end']",N/A

The movie features two  great British sprinters in post WWI England, each with very different  motivations for giving thier all to win the Olympic gold.

It has everything: three-dimensional characters; beautiful settings; period costumes; a compelling plot; tight direction; a triumphant climax; and a stirring score.  It is a classic in every sense of the word.  Nearly flawless.  Some might find the pace a bit slow by modern standards, but this just allows the patient viewer time to drink in the performances and to catch the subtle nuances.  It rightly won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1981, as well as Writing, Costume Design and Original Score.Chariots of Fire tells the true story of two British runners.  But this is much more than a sports movie.  One of the men (Ben Cross) is a secular Jew who runs in order to prove his worth to a subtly anti-Semitic British society.  The other (Ian Charleson) is a Scottish Christian missionary who runs for the glory of God.  Their lives intersect when they become rivals under the same flag during the 1924 Olympics.This blu-ray book edition contains 36 pages of photos and behind-the-scenes information.  In addition to the film (which is presented in a 1.77:1 aspect ratio), the disc contains deleted scenes, five documentaries, screen tests, commentary, the theatrical trailer and more.The blu-ray transfer is very good, but not perfect.  The level of detail is greatly enhanced from the DVD, but there is noticeable film grain in many shots.  This did not trouble me, however, because the movie is set in the 1920s, and the film grain contributed to an older feel.  The sound was a little more problematic, however.  I am using a Sony SS-C150.  Sometimes the dialogue was not completely clear.  The soundtrack was fine though.Parental Advisory: This movie is very tame by modern standards.  It shows characters smoking and drinking on occasion, and there is one brief scene where a man can be seen showering in a locker room.  One instance of profanity was actually added to the movie in order to avoid a G rating, which the producers thought would hurt its acceptance by critics.  While it would certainly be suitable for children to watch, I do not know that they would appreciate it.I highly recommend this movie.  It is a ""must see.""

As the object of Gielguld's bigotry, Ben Cross gives an intense, but dignified performance.

I have known about the movie for many years, but have never gotten around to seeing it - until recently.  The experience was underwhelming.  The main story revolves around two competing track runners from England around the 1910s and 1920s.  One of the main problems I noticed early on was the sound quality.  Even though I was watching the remastered DVD, the dialogue sounds muddled and confusing.  It is difficult to understand what the characters are saying; its as though the filmmakers used poor microphones when shooting the dialogue.Another major problem was that the story and the characters are not very interesting.  It difficult to understand the motives of the characters and what is going on in the story.  Perhaps I don't understand the history surrounding the story, but I found it difficult to get into what the characters were about.  The story was supposed to make us feel uplifted, but I did not get that feeling at all.

94849,A29VKODW4R5U7W,0790731010,dooby,"[35, 36]","I watched this movie when it first came out in the theaters some twenty odd years ago. It has remained one of my favorites ever since, both for its inspirational story and its deeply moving quality. It contrasts two men who run in the 1924 Paris Olympics. One man runs for the glory of his God. The other runs to prove that even a nobody, an outcast, can be as good as any of the privileged of the land. Cynics may call it cheap manipulation, but the film still brings a tear to the eye each time I watch it. It certainly deserves to be ranked as one of the finest movies ever made. It is uplifting, it is triumphant and most of all it is filled with a grace and a quiet decency that sadly seems to have been lost through the intervening years.After years of having to watch it in a claustrophobic pan-&-scan format, it should be a joy to finally be able to see it in its widescreen splendor once again.However, this DVD is NOT in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 although it blatantly advertises itself as such on the back cover. It has been cropped at the sides to 1.78:1 (anamorphic). A true 1.85:1 transfer would have thin black bars appearing across the top and bottom of a widescreen TV. This version has been modified to fill up the entire widescreen TV probably to please some people who cannot seem to stomach any black bars appearing on their screens. If you want to check, you can play it back on a computer and measure the actual frame dimensions. The ratio works out to 1.78:1. Another way is to just compare some of the deleted scenes, which are in the actual 1.85:1 ratio. Where the deleted scenes and the main feature overlap, you can see where they cropped off the sides. It's disappointing. When I buy a Special Edition, I expect to view the film in its original aspect ratio, not in some modified cropped format.Aside from that quibble, this is the best this movie has looked since its first release. The opening and closing credits are noticeably grainy but the movie itself is beautifully restored with sharp, clear images, good contrast and beautiful well saturated colors. There are some dirt specks and the occasional juddering frame but this is kept to a minimum. The 5.1 surround excellently reproduces Vangelis' throbbing score. Hopefully when they next release this movie in the upcoming high definition format, they will finally get it in the correct aspect ratio. Till then this DVD is the next best thing.P.S. To whoever is in charge of re-releasing Chariots in the future, kindly reinsert the cricket segment into the movie. I remember watching that at the theater the first time round. Apparently the cricket segment was shown worldwide with the sole exception of America. It belongs in the film, not in the Deleted Scenes section - looking dark, grimy and totally unrestored. It is the first time in the film that all the characters meet. Does Warner have a thing against cricket? It is England's national sport. It is the sport of Gentlemen. It is the older cousin to baseball. The word cricket itself has become a synonym for fair-play in the English language. And it marks these men for who and what they are. For goodness sake, get it right the third time round.",4,"Chariots of Fire again shortchanged...

I have watched it a few times since, and it never grows old. The acting is superb, the characters have depth, and the message is uplifting.Set immediately before and during the 1924 Olympics, the movie stars Ian Charleson as Eric Liddell and Ben Cross as Harold Abraham. Liddell is a Scotch Presbyterian, whose parents were missionaries and who himself is also an aspiring missionary. Abraham is a secular Jew. The two have little in common, other than that they are both world-class runners and attend Cambridge. Otherwise, they are as different as night and day. Liddell runs to glorify God. Abraham runs to win for himself.The first part of the movie develops the characters of these two runners as it shows them training for the Olympics. The movie then shifts to France and the Olympics itself. Liddell faces a conflict. His main event is the 100-yard dash. However, this race is scheduled for a Sunday, and Liddell, as a strict Sabbatarian, refuses to run on Sundays. Instead, he switches to the 400-yard dash, which is not his best event.Throughout the movie we see the conflict between the worldview of these two runners and how it affects their convictions and what they are willing and not willing to do to win a medal and receive the accolades of their countrymen. This is far more than a movie about runners. It is a film that causes us to reflect on our own convictions and whether or not they are so worth living for that we are willing to sacrifice our own self-interests for their sake.One note of caution: Not surprisingly, the movie, although on the whole accurate, does make some minor adjustments of the facts for the sake of the story line. These are detailed in a book by Sally Magnusson, ""The Flying Scotsman,"" which is a biography of Liddell and which details his life after the Olympics as well as the Olympics themselves.",5,As good as ever,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,1944,"['watched', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'more', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'watched', 'few', 'times', 'never', 'old', 'acting', 'superb', 'characters', 'have', 'depth', 'message', 'uplifting.Set', 'immediately', '1924', 'Olympics', 'movie', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'Harold', 'Abraham', 'Liddell', 'Scotch', 'Presbyterian', 'parents', 'were', 'missionaries', 'who', 'also', 'aspiring', 'missionary', 'Abraham', 'secular', 'Jew', 'two', 'have', 'little', 'common', 'other', 'are', 'world-class', 'runners', 'attend', 'Cambridge', 'Otherwise', 'are', 'as', 'different', 'night', 'day', 'Liddell', 'glorify', 'God', 'Abraham', 'win', 'himself.The', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'characters', 'two', 'runners', 'training', 'Olympics', 'movie', 'then', 'France', 'Olympics', 'Liddell', 'conflict', 'main', 'event', '100-yard', 'dash', 'However', 'race', 'scheduled', 'Sunday', 'Liddell', 'strict', 'Sabbatarian', 'run', 'Sundays', 'Instead', '400-yard', 'dash', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'see', 'conflict', 'worldview', 'two', 'runners', 'how', 'convictions', 'what', 'are', 'willing', 'not', 'willing', 'do', 'win', 'medal', 'receive', 'accolades', 'countrymen', 'far', 'more', 'movie', 'runners', 'film', 'reflect', 'own', 'convictions', 'not', 'are', 'so', 'worth', 'living', 'are', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'own', 'self-interests', 'sake.One', 'note', 'caution', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'movie', 'whole', 'accurate', 'make', 'minor', 'adjustments', 'facts', 'sake', 'story', 'line', 'are', 'detailed', 'book', 'Sally', 'Magnusson', 'Flying', 'Scotsman', 'biography', 'Liddell', 'details', 'life', 'Olympics', 'as', 'well', 'Olympics']",N/A

First of all, on disc 1, we get a very nice wide-screen (1.85:1 ratio)version of the feature and the option of a very interesting commentary track by director Hugh Hudson.Disc 2 offers two new documentaries that are way above average. ""Wings on Their Heels: The Making of Chariots of Fire"" has interviews with almost all of the surviving artists who appear in or worked on the film. We get a great understanding of just how difficult it was to get the film made at all. The excitement of Oscar night, when the film unexpectedly took the ""Best Picture"" honor, is captured with clips from the show and new information from the producer, director and actor Ben Cross. A very informative job has been done in helping us to understand how this ""cinderella"" film made it from original screenplay to one of the finest films of the 1980s. The ""thrill"" and the ""pride"" that the cast and creators had in making the film is strongly felt.The second documentary, ""Chariots of Fire: A Reunion"", was filmed in England and reunites together in one room, three of the actors along with the producer, director and cinematographer. They converse back and forth, sharing many special experiences that they had with the film. I found this to be fascinating.The third ""Extra"" in the inclusion of 16 minuntes of very interesting scenes that were not used in the final film, including a scene that appears in the British version of the film that was removed for its American prints.

I've been a runner since I first went running out in the country with my dad when I was 8 or 9.  This movie really speaks to the runner in anyone.  There's something pure about running, and this captures that feeling perfectly.  Whether it's the Scotsman running with a group of kids, having fun, or if it's the drive for glory by racing around the courtyard before the bell finishes tolling at noon, this movie captures that pureness better than anything I've seen.The story focuses on two runners, heading for the Olympics.  One is an obsessive, driven student and the other is a deeply religious man, who runs for god.  Both of their stories are very interesting as you come to see their motivations.  When it gets to the Olympics themselves, a scene of purer sportsmanship and nobility you'll never see.  I don't want to say anymore to avoid ruining the ending.Even if you aren't a runner, you'll like this movie.  Of course, if you hate running, you may have a hard time with it.

94861,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0790731010,"""flickjunkie""","[10, 10]","I enjoy sports films, especially when they are used to exemplify greater human truths.  In that regard ""Chariots of Fire"" is one of my favorite sports films.  What differentiates this film is that it is really a human story about sports rather than a pure sports story.  Based on a true story, it centers on two gifted athletes and their quest to run in the 1924 Olympics.  The first is Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a haughty sprinter with an obsession for winning.  Abrahams, who is Jewish, is a man with something to prove, mostly to himself.  His rival is Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), the first man to ever beat him in a sprint.  Liddell is a devout Christian and runs for the glory of God.There is an exquisite interplay of subtle themes in this film underlying the obvious sports tale.  There is the contrast of motives.  Abraham runs to validate his feeling of personal power, and his preoccupation with winning is actually motivated by his fear of losing.  His quest is torturous, and ultimately his victory empty, more of a relief than a triumph.  Liddell runs out of a desire to repay God for the physical gifts he has been given.  He is at peace with himself, but at odds with all those who want to control him.  Their rivalry represents a battle between the forces of the physical and spiritual.  Other themes pervade the film.  We have undercurrents of bigotry against the Jewish runner, a man of whom Cambridge was begrudgingly proud while berating him behind his back.  We have sinister political attempts at manipulation in the face of Liddell's staunch integrity in adhering to his principles.  Together, these forces combine to produce a film rich in drama and meaning.The film has been criticized for its inaccuracies.  Some say Abraham did not suffer from anti-Semitic bigotry and that he was wildly popular at Cambridge.  This does not necessarily mean he didn't feel inferior.  No one can know what childhood experiences might have affected his psyche.  Jackson Scholz was quoted as saying he never gave Liddell a note of encouragement on the track.  I have to agree that this was a bit of Hollywood drivel that didn't need to be there.  Additionally, Liddell knew weeks before that the heats would be on a Sunday, not just before the race as shown, and he was always scheduled to run the 400-meter race.  The meeting of political bigwigs that allowed him to switch from the 100 to the 400 was pure fabrication to emphasize his resistance to compromising his beliefs about running on the Sabbath.  However, these liberties can be forgiven because they enriched the story and did not change history in major ways.The direction by Hugh Hudson is powerful.  Hudson captures the feeling and excitement of track and field competition, as well as giving us numerous beautifully photographed scenes and a wonderful period rendering.  Though nominated for an Oscar, Hudson was unable to capitalize on the success of this film, and he has directed very few, mostly minor films since.  The music by Vangelis is also wonderful, and it won the Best Music Oscar.Ben Cross is fantastic as Abrahams.  He brings great intensity to Abrahams' single-minded obsession for winning.  Cross hasn't done much film work since, but has had a long and distinguished career in TV.  Ian Charleson is also excellent as Liddell, but his career went the same route as Cross'.This minor film was the sleeper of 1981, nominated for seven Academy Awards and winning four, including Best Picture.  I rated it a 10/10.  It combines the best elements of human drama and sport to create a potent and engrossing film.",5,An engrossing and powerful sports story,979689600,"01 17, 2001",2001,3600,"['enjoy', 'sports', 'films', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'used', 'exemplify', 'greater', 'human', 'truths', 'regard', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'one', 'favorite', 'sports', 'films', 'What', 'film', 'really', 'human', 'story', 'sports', 'rather', 'pure', 'sports', 'story', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'two', 'gifted', 'athletes', 'quest', 'run', '1924', 'Olympics', 'first', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'haughty', 'sprinter', 'obsession', 'winning', 'Abrahams', 'who', 'Jewish', 'man', 'something', 'prove', 'mostly', 'rival', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'first', 'man', 'ever', 'beat', 'sprint', 'Liddell', 'devout', 'Christian', 'glory', 'God.There', 'exquisite', 'interplay', 'subtle', 'themes', 'film', 'underlying', 'obvious', 'sports', 'tale', 'contrast', 'motives', 'Abraham', 'validate', 'feeling', 'personal', 'power', 'preoccupation', 'winning', 'actually', 'motivated', 'fear', 'losing', 'quest', 'torturous', 'ultimately', 'victory', 'empty', 'more', 'relief', 'triumph', 'Liddell', 'desire', 'repay', 'God', 'physical', 'gifts', 'been', 'given', 'peace', 'odds', 'who', 'want', 'control', 'rivalry', 'battle', 'forces', 'physical', 'spiritual', 'Other', 'themes', 'pervade', 'film', 'have', 'undercurrents', 'bigotry', 'Jewish', 'runner', 'man', 'whom', 'Cambridge', 'was', 'begrudgingly', 'proud', 'berating', 'back', 'have', 'sinister', 'political', 'attempts', 'manipulation', 'face', 'Liddell', 'staunch', 'integrity', 'adhering', 'principles', 'Together', 'forces', 'combine', 'produce', 'film', 'rich', 'drama', 'meaning.The', 'film', 'been', 'criticized', 'inaccuracies', 'say', 'Abraham', 'did', 'not', 'suffer', 'anti-Semitic', 'bigotry', 'was', 'wildly', 'popular', 'Cambridge', 'not', 'necessarily', 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'inferior', 'one', 'can', 'know', 'what', 'childhood', 'experiences', 'might', 'have', 'affected', 'psyche', 'Jackson', 'Scholz', 'was', 'quoted', 'saying', 'never', 'gave', 'Liddell', 'note', 'encouragement', 'track', 'have', 'agree', 'was', 'bit', 'Hollywood', 'drivel', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'there', 'Additionally', 'Liddell', 'knew', 'weeks', 'heats', 'would', 'be', 'Sunday', 'not', 'just', 'race', 'shown', 'was', 'always', 'scheduled', 'run', '400-meter', 'race', 'meeting', 'political', 'bigwigs', 'allowed', 'switch', '100', '400', 'was', 'pure', 'fabrication', 'emphasize', 'resistance', 'compromising', 'beliefs', 'running', 'Sabbath', 'However', 'liberties', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'enriched', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'change', 'history', 'major', 'ways.The', 'direction', 'Hugh', 'Hudson', 'powerful', 'Hudson', 'feeling', 'excitement', 'track', 'field', 'competition', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'numerous', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'scenes', 'wonderful', 'period', 'rendering', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Hudson', 'was', 'unable', 'capitalize', 'success', 'film', 'directed', 'very', 'few', 'mostly', 'minor', 'films', 'music', 'Vangelis', 'also', 'wonderful', 'won', 'Best', 'Music', 'Oscar.Ben', 'Cross', 'fantastic', 'Abrahams', 'great', 'intensity', 'Abrahams', 'single-minded', 'obsession', 'winning', 'Cross', ""n't"", 'done', 'much', 'film', 'work', 'had', 'long', 'distinguished', 'career', 'TV', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'also', 'excellent', 'Liddell', 'career', 'went', 'same', 'route', ""Cross'.This"", 'minor', 'film', 'was', 'sleeper', '1981', 'nominated', 'seven', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'winning', 'four', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'rated', '10/10', 'best', 'elements', 'human', 'drama', 'sport', 'create', 'potent', 'engrossing', 'film']",N/A

The film had great acclaim when it first came out and picked up four Academy Awards including Best Picture.

That song was replayed at dozens of competitive runs I attended for over the next five years.""Chariots of Fire"" is an excellent movie. The setting and photography were marvelous. How they ever manage to recreate 1920s London was amazing and those old British cars are magnificent. The acting was quite excellent. The story of running and running competition was quite of interest to runners and quite well done, although I cringe when seeing some of the runners smoking.

94870,A1MAG8BDOVJHTT,0790731010,"G. Swift ""97jedi""","[3, 3]","Thirty years on, Chariots of Fire is still an amazing film. While it benefits from being at least for the most part a period piece, that all the eras are noted and dated means nothing is supposed to be ""present day"" long after that present has passed.Telling the tale of the British 1924 Olympics track team, focusing particularly on Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell, who won the gold medals in their events. Liddell is an incredibly pious man who refuses to run on Sundays, choosing instead to honor the Lord per the Bible's teachings. Abrahams is a Jew in Britain who experiences the particular brand of British anti-semitism and uses his remarkable running skill to show up those who look down upon him for his ancestry. From the beginning of their quest to make the Olympic team, through their pseudo-rivalry in which Liddell is shown to be the faster sprinter, to their time as teammates in Paris, this film shows the individual efforts each man makes and the trials he goes through before the penultimate scene of the film.As when it was released, the opening and closing scenes are breathtaking, with the runners on the beach, backed by Vangelis' rousing and fantastic theme to the movie, which is not played outside of those two occurrences. The rest of the music throughout is good, but it pales in comparison to the theme, which is one of the most recognizable in film history.Regarding the DVD itself, the video and sound transfer are well done, to the point that the gnats spoken of in the commentary can be seen, out of focus, in the foreground of the scenes in Scotland. The subtitles are not quite accurate, often skipping words entirely and missing the starts of a character's speech, though they get the gist of the spoken words; still, they could be better.I'm not certain the two-disc version is worth the extra expense, since all you get are some deleted scenes, which are not themselves remastered and most of which are in pan and scan format rather than widescreen. There are two documentaries made when the DVD was produced, so the actors and creators are much older. You get to see part of the Oscar ceremony where the four awards were presented, but not entire acceptance speeches.If the DVD features were better, this would have earned five stars without questions, but when evaluating a DVD you cannot consider just the quality of the film, which in this case is among the best ever made.",4,Still one of the best ever made,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,2415,"['Thirty', 'years', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'still', 'amazing', 'film', 'benefits', 'being', 'least', 'most', 'part', 'period', 'piece', 'eras', 'are', 'noted', 'dated', 'means', 'nothing', 'supposed', 'be', 'present', 'day', 'long', 'present', 'passed.Telling', 'tale', 'British', '1924', 'Olympics', 'track', 'team', 'focusing', 'particularly', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'who', 'won', 'gold', 'medals', 'events', 'Liddell', 'incredibly', 'pious', 'man', 'who', 'run', 'Sundays', 'choosing', 'instead', 'honor', 'Lord', 'Bible', 'teachings', 'Abrahams', 'Jew', 'Britain', 'who', 'particular', 'brand', 'British', 'anti-semitism', 'remarkable', 'running', 'skill', 'show', 'up', 'who', 'look', 'down', 'upon', 'ancestry', 'beginning', 'quest', 'make', 'Olympic', 'team', 'pseudo-rivalry', 'Liddell', 'shown', 'be', 'faster', 'sprinter', 'time', 'teammates', 'Paris', 'film', 'individual', 'efforts', 'man', 'trials', 'penultimate', 'scene', 'film.As', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'opening', 'closing', 'scenes', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'runners', 'beach', 'backed', 'Vangelis', 'rousing', 'fantastic', 'theme', 'movie', 'not', 'played', 'two', 'occurrences', 'rest', 'music', 'good', 'comparison', 'theme', 'one', 'most', 'recognizable', 'film', 'history.Regarding', 'DVD', 'video', 'sound', 'transfer', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'point', 'gnats', 'spoken', 'commentary', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'focus', 'foreground', 'scenes', 'Scotland', 'subtitles', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'accurate', 'often', 'skipping', 'words', 'entirely', 'missing', 'starts', 'character', 'speech', 'get', 'gist', 'spoken', 'words', 'still', 'could', 'be', 'better.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'two-disc', 'version', 'extra', 'expense', 'get', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'remastered', 'most', 'are', 'pan', 'scan', 'format', 'rather', 'widescreen', 'are', 'two', 'documentaries', 'made', 'when', 'DVD', 'was', 'produced', 'actors', 'creators', 'are', 'much', 'older', 'get', 'see', 'part', 'Oscar', 'ceremony', 'where', 'four', 'awards', 'were', 'presented', 'not', 'entire', 'acceptance', 'speeches.If', 'DVD', 'features', 'were', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'earned', 'five', 'stars', 'questions', 'when', 'evaluating', 'DVD', 'can', 'not', 'consider', 'just', 'quality', 'film', 'case', 'best', 'ever', 'made']",N/A

There is a God... Until then, my current review stands.]Dedication, duty and the passion for victory, both personal and spiritual. A magisterial score. Olympian triumph in the waning light of Empire. This film has (or rather had) it all.It's a sad but true fact that were this film to be released today it wouldn't have even been a ""sleeper"", let alone an Oscar Winner. It would have quietly been passed over for the latest star-vehicle featuring [enter movie star of the month here]. Oh, maybe for costumes or art direction, but that's it. It would've remained art house or just gone straight to video.From my personal experience vault: I distinctly remember when I walked out  of the theater. I was very young, very impressionable, and absolutely astonished by what I saw. Here was heroism of the kind that only knew from myth and fantasy stories. Here were runners peforming like gods, but they were real, which made their victories (and defeats) the stuff of legend, yet attainable on Earth. I caught the bug and became a track athlete.Years later, there was a theatrical re-release and I was hesitant about seeing it. It had been a long, long time since I strapped on my running spikes and stared down the lanes of a track. Would the indelible impression the film made on my young heart be now seen as just a childish emotional reaction? Would the whole story seem dated and, dare I say it, cheesy? No. It still evoked those feelings of triumph -- this time, I could appreciate the film for its wider themes of glory, prejudice and redemption. It was more than magnificent.And yet in the end, DVD and the powers that be have robbed this fim of its artistry. No widescreen edition for Region1?? (And according to one DVD vendor in the UK, there IS  widescreen, but alas, R2 only...) Do they think that Americans don't go for ""foreign"" films, even Oscar Winners? How insulting. Until there's a proper widescreen version--with or without special features, I'm not particular but they would be welcome--I will, sadly, not have this tremendous film in my library.Attention other film lovers: Don't give in and buy it, no matter how much you love this film.

Snyder,"[0, 0]","The Blu-ray edition of Chariots of Fire not only provides the expected improvements of high-definition video and audio, in the Digi-book release it also includes a CD with the main themes from the ground-breaking musical score by Greek composer Vangelis. Delightfully old-fashioned in its approach to storytelling even when it was released in 1981, today this film is a refreshing &#8220;blast from the past&#8221;, and well worth adding to a movie collection.Based on the true story of two British runners competing in the 1924 Paris Olympic Games, Chariots of Fire is an example of the tremendous skill that British filmmakers bring to so-called &#8216;costume dramas&#8221;. Some veteran actors are present in peripheral roles, including John Gielgud and Ian Holm, but due to the youth of the athletes in the Games the majority of the actors were unknowns who rose to stardom on the strength of this film. Principal among them were Ian Charleson and Ben Cross, as the Scottish runner Eric Liddell and Englishman Harold Abrahams. Both compete in the 100 meter sprint, and are thus natural rivals. Their training for the Games, and their reasons for running, are the basis of the story, which is developed in detail and with surprising interest.This was an unlikely topic for a film and an unlikely film for an Academy Award, and consequently an astounding triumph when it deservedly took the top prize as Best Picture. The Vangelis music is a modern synthesizer production, another unlikely element for a film about the 1920s, but it is so completely unique and fresh that it created its own reality, and became an iconic film score. The main theme, usually known as Chariots of Fire, but actually given the prosaic name &#8220;Titles&#8221; since it plays behind the rolling of the credits at the opening of the film, is one of the most widely recognized and loved movie themes in history.Extras include interviews that reveal how this film came to be, with a series of chance occurrences and coincidences that led ultimately to its production and eventual Academy Award glory.",5,A Successful Life is a Race Well Run,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,2080,"['Blu-ray', 'edition', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'not', 'only', 'expected', 'improvements', 'high-definition', 'video', 'audio', 'Digi-book', 'release', 'also', 'CD', 'main', 'themes', 'ground-breaking', 'musical', 'score', 'Greek', 'composer', 'Vangelis', 'Delightfully', 'old-fashioned', 'approach', 'storytelling', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'released', '1981', 'today', 'film', 'refreshing', '8220', 'blast', 'past', '8221', 'well', 'worth', 'adding', 'movie', 'collection.Based', 'true', 'story', 'two', 'British', 'runners', 'competing', '1924', 'Paris', 'Olympic', 'Games', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'example', 'tremendous', 'skill', 'British', 'filmmakers', 'bring', 'so-called', '8216', 'costume', 'dramas', '8221', 'veteran', 'actors', 'are', 'present', 'peripheral', 'roles', 'including', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'due', 'youth', 'athletes', 'Games', 'majority', 'actors', 'were', 'unknowns', 'who', 'rose', 'stardom', 'strength', 'film', 'Principal', 'were', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'Scottish', 'runner', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'Englishman', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'compete', '100', 'meter', 'sprint', 'are', 'thus', 'natural', 'rivals', 'training', 'Games', 'reasons', 'running', 'are', 'basis', 'story', 'developed', 'detail', 'surprising', 'interest.This', 'was', 'unlikely', 'topic', 'film', 'unlikely', 'film', 'Academy', 'Award', 'consequently', 'astounding', 'triumph', 'when', 'deservedly', 'took', 'top', 'prize', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Vangelis', 'music', 'modern', 'synthesizer', 'production', 'unlikely', 'element', 'film', '1920s', 'so', 'completely', 'unique', 'fresh', 'created', 'own', 'reality', 'became', 'iconic', 'film', 'score', 'main', 'theme', 'usually', 'known', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'actually', 'given', 'prosaic', 'name', '8220', 'Titles', '8221', 'rolling', 'credits', 'opening', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'widely', 'recognized', 'loved', 'movie', 'themes', 'history.Extras', 'include', 'interviews', 'reveal', 'how', 'film', 'came', 'be', 'series', 'chance', 'occurrences', 'coincidences', 'led', 'ultimately', 'production', 'eventual', 'Academy', 'Award', 'glory']",N/A

It was directed by a director who later directed ""Greystoke"".  The music was written by a self-professed pagan, who dedicated the title track to Pan.  A Christian was played by an actor who had no interest in Christianity, and died of AIDS due to his lifestyle.  The result is one of the most inspirational movies of all time.This is not the fastest moving movie of all time, very philosophical and introspective.  Additionally, having several blond actors that are not big names adds to the confusion; I spent most of the first time seeing this movie confusing Nicholas Farrell with Ian Charleston.  Thus, I would advise watching this movie twice, to help you appreciate it fuller.The producer, David Putnam, said in an interview with Bob Costas that he had some people come up to him and say, ""That was a great movie about Harold Abrams (played by Ben Cross), and the Eric Liddell (Ian Charleston) character was interesting.""  He then said others told him ""That was a great movie about Eric Liddell, and the Harold Abrams character was interesting.""  This shows how even the portrayal of the characters are.  This movie did an excellent job of going back and forth between the two main characters.  There are lessons to be learned by a pair of the supporting actors as well:  free spirited Lord Lindsay (Nigel Havers) and content Aubrey Montague (Nicholas Farrell).  (I relate a lot to the Montague character.)I have seen a documentary on the life of Liddell.  It pointed out that the crisis of faith was known by Liddell in real life sooner than he did in the movie, and did not wrestle with the decision as he did in the movie.

The overall quality of the film, however, is not as good as these individual factors.

Had they either made it shorter, or had a more complex story, it would have been much better.  Next, one mustn't forget the acting. The two actors (whose name's escape me) that played Abrahams and Liddell were fine. Ian Holm, however, was pathetic. How he managed to extract an Oscar Nomination from his pitiful performance is beyond me.

To make matters all the more sublimely ridiculous, anyone with an ounce of knowledge would be aware that all this forced sentimentalism for two sons of privilege occurs whilst the corrupt British-imposed Treaty of Versailles was nurturing the seeds of fascism in Germany, and Imperial British forces were viciously exploiting the peoples of Africa, India, and East Asia to fund all this hubris.Then why all the Oscars, you ask?  Certainly Hollywood is too easily intoxicated by the appearance of even the most minute form of Jewish suffering.  What is next, Adam Sandler's passionate quest for mazza balls whilst living in Wisconsin?  Laugh if you must, but Chariots of Fire is about two paces away from being that absurd.This is not a bad film.  But it just didn't deserve all the accolades.  If you want to see a great film about the British made in 1981, watch Gallipoli.  If you want to see a great British film, watch Lawrence of Arabia or Gandhi.

But I think it's worth the effort.It follows the lives of four young men (Harold Abrahams, Eric Liddell, Aubrey Montague, and Lord Andrew Lindsay) ... all track stars ... each very different from the other ... and all olympic hopefuls.  Three of them are students (and friends) at England's most prestigious university - Cambridge.  The fourth (Liddell) is a runner from Scotland ... and the son of Christian missionaries.  Abrahams and Liddell (true life characters) are more the focus of the movie.It's a beautiful movie ... with that time and place being convincingly brought to life.  And the acting is superb.  Ben Cross (as the intense Harold Abrahams) is particularly good.  We may not be able to imagine ourselves in their situation, but, by virtue of these excellent performances, we cannot help but root for them ... as they strive to excel.The finish line (in this movie about running) is the 1924 summer olympic games held in Paris, France.  All four gentlemen are members of the British olympic squad ... and all four hope to win a gold medal.  Three do.  ""Chariots of Fire"" goes beneath the surface, however ... past the physical training ... and looks at the heart and conscience of Abrahams and Liddell ... and this gives the movie some nice depth.(It may be interesting that) In real life ... Harold Abrahams went on to become a successful barrister (attorney) in London.  He died in 1978 at the age of 79.  Eric Liddell gave up running (after the 1924 olympics) and, like his parents, became a missionary in China.  While there, he was taken prisoner by the (invading) Japanese and placed in an internment camp ... where he died, in 1945, at the age of 43 ... reportedly from a brain tumor.But ""Chariots of Fire"" is a good movie.

94905,A6ADO7B6FUVN,0790731010,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[7, 8]","Sports and competitive leisure was something for the aristocrats and rich before and the years after World War I.  Thorstein Veblen's work The Theory of the Leisure Class provides a detailed description with intricate notions and ideas in regards to this topic.  One must understand that the socioeconomic climate of the society, as average people were forced to work and often lacked adequate education, which provided an opportunity for sport.  Furthermore, the time it took to play games on foreign soil often required financial means, which meant that Olympic games and other sporting events were almost only limited to the upper class who also enforced rules of amateurism.  The rule of amateurism was applied to sports in order to keep the sports clean from monetary profiteering, but it also kept the ordinary and undesired people away from sports.  Participating amateurs in sports events were usually upper class, and not allowed to accept any form of payment which did not affect them as they usually had old money within the family.  In the shadow of this notion, the audience should consider the limited number of actual participants in the Olympic games that existed before the 1930s.  This information should be in the back of the head of the audience as they sit down to enjoy the terrific film, Chariots of Fire.A simplistic view of Chariots of Fire could be that it deals with men who run.  However, this simplistic view will not give the film the justice it deserves, as the elaborate theme actually begins in shadow of World War I.  The theme is actually explicitly clarified during the Freshmen Dinner at Cambridge where the Master provides the newcomers with a poignant speech in regards to the past and the necessity of self-discovery.  The Master points out that through their studies the students should find their strengths, which they should maximize, as they should develop their own ""...honesty, goodness, vigor, zeal, and intellectual promise.""  This speech provides an encouraging motivation to better themselves, and the society within which they live. In the backdrop of this speech the story focuses on a couple of British gentlemen from two very different cultures -- one a Jew and the other a Christian.Initially, the story opens in the middle of Harold M. Abrahams' funeral, which brings the audience back in time through a double flashback.  The first flashback is a shot of when the runners in 1923 prepare on a beach for the Olympic games of 1924. In the second flashback, the audience is introduced to the eloquent Harold M. Abrahams (Ben Cross) who is about to begin his university studies at Cambridge where old traditions rule.  Abrahams' background is first revealed through Master of Trinity (John Gielgud) and Master of Caius (Lindsay Anderson) who are discussing with delicate irritation in their tone how his father acquired his wealth.  A Jewish heritage has proven to Abrahams that he must work harder than others in order to accomplish his goals.  This has fostered a tenacious attitude within him to succeed that does not stop at anything, as long as he remains within the laws.  His attitude is well expressed during his first week when Abrahams challenges the College Dash, a run which no one has beaten in 700 years.Secondly, the audience is brought to Scotland to meet the other main character Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), who was born in China by a missionary family.  Liddell, a faithful protestant, has a unique talent to run and he finds that he is running to honor his God given skill and faith.  Whenever Liddell is not running he is preaching in comparison to how running requires same kind of heart that a faithful heart requires to God.  On occasion he finds himself in a predicament, as his faith collides with the worldview on sports, which culminates in the 1924 Olympics in Paris, France.Liddell and Abrahams were outsiders to the British class system, but they exemplify the statement given in regards to ""...honesty, goodness, vigor, zeal, and intellectual promise.""  Both men demonstrate their hard work and effort in regards to their preparations to competitive running while sportsmanship is expressed to contestants during competition.  The two men's intellectual promise shines when both face hardships, but through personal devotion to find a solution to the problem they visualize their wisdom.  Running is simply putting one foot in front of the other in a rapid manner, yet it is the purpose of ambition that provides the reason why these men run.Chariots of Fire come across as a period film with the elaborated mise-en-scene of the time shortly after World War I.  Yet, there is a personal touch to each character that leaves a lasting impression on the audience.  The impact that the characters have on the audience is much due to the excellent cast.  One character that stands out is Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm) who emits a strong persona that simply makes the viewer stare in wonder.  Another reason why the story is excellent is the meticulous script, which gives an authentic feel to the story.  In addition, the score by Vangelis initially brushes the mind to slowly create spectacular emotional fireworks in progress as the story unfolds.  The combined effect of all the aspects of filmmaking ultimately provides a marvelous cinematic experience with suspense, drama, and contemplation.",5,Class Struggle in the World of Sports -

94908,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0790731010,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","I never thought that ""Chariots of Fire"" was the best film of 1981 when it won the Oscar in 1982 for Best Picture.  If you liked epics there was ""Reds,"" which won the Best Director Oscar for Warren Beatty, and if you like acting you had Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn taking the top acting honors for ""On Golden Pond.""  My preference was for the ultimate Saturday morning serial with Steven Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""  Apparently Paramount's push for ""Reds"" was hurt because they also co-produced ""Raiders"" (and were distributing the fifth nominee ""Atlantic City"" as well).  But even though I have long held its Oscar against it, that does not stop ""Chariots of Fire"" from being one of the best sports movies eve because it is not just about winning, but how you run the race.The reason for that is that while it is a true story of two of the fastest men in the world competing in the 1924 Olympic in Paris, the facts provide an atypical finish to this tale of competition.  In Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) there is a natural opposition.  No, this does not refer to Abrahams being Jewish and Liddell a Christian, although the former's ancestry is held against him by the snobbish dons at Cambridge and the latter's faith is central to both his success as a runner and his personal crisis.  The more important contrast here is that Liddell is a natural runner, whose training consists of running across the hills of his native Scotland or sloshing through the shore, while Abrahams seeks the guidance of Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm), a professional trainer who looks at Abrahams lose his first race, to Liddell, and declares he can give the losing sprinter another two yards.The stage is clearly set for a rematch in the 100 yard competition at the Olympic games where both Abrahams and Liddell will be running for the team from the United Kingdom.  But the qualifying heats are on the Sunday after the opening ceremonies and Liddell refuses to run on the Sabbath.  The idea that we would be denied the big race that the movie has set up is rather shocking, but ""Chariots of Fire"" succeeds despite this handicap because the film is ultimately about more than just that race.  It is about running, which is why it begins and opens with the scene of the Olympic team running through the shore.  Besides, Liddell knew months before the Olympics that the preliminaries for the 100, his best event, would be held on a Sunday.  As for Abrahams, he never lost to Liddell because the two never raced against each other.  Yes, history has such a way of making the movies look fake, but Colin Welland (""A Dry White Season"") won an Oscar for his screenplay so what really happened can once again take a back seat to big screen drama.  Still, it is hard in the end to fault the messenger given the value of the message.Vang&eacute;lis Papathanassiou won an Oscar for his musical score and the theme song hit #1 on the pop charts, but I still find the contrast between a movie set in the 1920s and populated with characters who tend to sing Gilbert & Sullivan tunes with his electronic music rather odd.  But the characters of Abrahams and Liddell are their personal quests are such that we forgive such anachronisms because the purity of their efforts is such that it redeems such failings, even when that includes rewriting history to make it more dramatic.  Fortunately, director Hugh Hudson (""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes"") has the advantage of a cast that captures the time and place as well as the Milena Canonero's Oscar winning costume design.  Having a supporting cast that includes John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson, Alice Kriege, Brad Davis, Peter Egan and David Yelland helps as well, even though that is always par for the course with British costume dramas.",5,For the  pleasure of watching them run,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,3817,"['never', 'thought', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'was', 'best', 'film', '1981', 'when', 'won', 'Oscar', '1982', 'Best', 'Picture', 'liked', 'epics', 'was', 'Reds', 'won', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oscar', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'like', 'acting', 'had', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'taking', 'top', 'acting', 'honors', 'Golden', 'Pond', 'preference', 'was', 'ultimate', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'serial', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'Apparently', 'Paramount', 'push', 'Reds', 'was', 'hurt', 'also', 'co-produced', 'Raiders', 'were', 'distributing', 'fifth', 'nominee', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'well', 'even', 'have', 'long', 'held', 'Oscar', 'not', 'stop', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'sports', 'movies', 'eve', 'not', 'just', 'winning', 'how', 'run', 'race.The', 'reason', 'true', 'story', 'two', 'fastest', 'men', 'world', 'competing', '1924', 'Olympic', 'Paris', 'facts', 'provide', 'atypical', 'finish', 'tale', 'competition', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'natural', 'opposition', 'No', 'not', 'refer', 'Abrahams', 'being', 'Jewish', 'Liddell', 'Christian', 'former', 'ancestry', 'held', 'snobbish', 'dons', 'Cambridge', 'latter', 'faith', 'central', 'success', 'runner', 'personal', 'crisis', 'more', 'important', 'contrast', 'here', 'Liddell', 'natural', 'runner', 'training', 'running', 'hills', 'native', 'Scotland', 'sloshing', 'shore', 'Abrahams', 'guidance', 'Sam', 'Mussabini', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'professional', 'trainer', 'who', 'Abrahams', 'lose', 'first', 'race', 'Liddell', 'can', 'give', 'losing', 'sprinter', 'two', 'yards.The', 'stage', 'clearly', 'set', 'rematch', '100', 'yard', 'competition', 'Olympic', 'games', 'where', 'Abrahams', 'Liddell', 'will', 'be', 'running', 'team', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'qualifying', 'heats', 'are', 'Sunday', 'opening', 'ceremonies', 'Liddell', 'run', 'Sabbath', 'idea', 'would', 'be', 'denied', 'big', 'race', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'rather', 'shocking', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'handicap', 'film', 'ultimately', 'more', 'just', 'race', 'running', 'why', 'scene', 'Olympic', 'team', 'running', 'shore', 'Besides', 'Liddell', 'knew', 'months', 'Olympics', 'preliminaries', '100', 'best', 'event', 'would', 'be', 'held', 'Sunday', 'Abrahams', 'never', 'lost', 'Liddell', 'two', 'never', 'raced', 'other', 'Yes', 'history', 'way', 'making', 'movies', 'look', 'fake', 'Colin', 'Welland', 'Dry', 'White', 'Season', 'won', 'Oscar', 'screenplay', 'so', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'can', 'once', 'again', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'big', 'screen', 'drama', 'Still', 'hard', 'end', 'fault', 'messenger', 'given', 'value', 'message.Vang', 'eacute', 'Papathanassiou', 'won', 'Oscar', 'musical', 'score', 'theme', 'song', 'hit', '1', 'pop', 'charts', 'still', 'find', 'contrast', 'movie', 'set', '1920s', 'populated', 'characters', 'who', 'tend', 'sing', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'electronic', 'music', 'rather', 'odd', 'characters', 'Abrahams', 'Liddell', 'are', 'personal', 'quests', 'are', 'such', 'forgive', 'such', 'anachronisms', 'purity', 'efforts', 'such', 'such', 'failings', 'even', 'when', 'rewriting', 'history', 'make', 'more', 'dramatic', 'Fortunately', 'director', 'Hugh', 'Hudson', 'Greystoke', 'Legend', 'Tarzan', 'Lord', 'Apes', 'advantage', 'cast', 'time', 'place', 'as', 'well', 'Milena', 'Canonero', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'costume', 'design', 'Having', 'supporting', 'cast', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Lindsay', 'Anderson', 'Alice', 'Kriege', 'Brad', 'Davis', 'Peter', 'Egan', 'David', 'Yelland', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'always', 'par', 'course', 'British', 'costume', 'dramas']",N/A
94909,A1L43KWWR05PCS,0790731010,Lawyeraau,"[261, 272]","This is a beautiful film, well directed by Hugh Hudson in his theatrical film debut. It features the true life story of two Olympic runners, Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) and Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), who ran for Great Britain in the 1924 Olympic Games and brought home the Gold.The film tells the story of these two individuals, who are as different from each other as different can be, and explores their personal drive and reasons for running. Eric Liddell is a staunch Scot and a fervid Presbyterian (He would put John Knox to shame!). The son of a missionary and himself a missionary by avocation, he runs because ""God made him fast for a reason"". His running is a reconciliation of his faith and his passion, which is running. He runs for the glory of God. His faith always remains constant and pre-eminent in his life. His devotion to it causes some controversy during the Olympics, as a  consequence of the stance he takes when he discovers that the preliminary mete for the 200 metre race would be held on a Sunday. Liddell simply refuses to run on the Sabbath! Luckily for Great Britain, Lord Andrew Lindsay (Nigel Havers), a gentleman and fellow competitor, graciously steps in and, as he had already won a gold medal in the hurdles, gives him his place in the 400 metre dash, which would take place on a Thursday. This would never happen today in the dog eat dog world of competitive sports, much less in the Olympics of today!Harold Abrahams is completely different. A secular Jew and Cambridge scholar, he studies in the bastion of upper crust British society, struggling to fit in but always remaining the proverbial outsider. He has a passion for running that is motivated by his passion for winning. In his world, God has nothing to do with it. Winning is merely an affirmation of himself in a world that he believes thinks less of him because he is a Jew. Consequently, his desire to win is superceded only by his fear of losing. When two Cambridge dons, the Master of Trinity, played by the late John Gielgud, along with the Master of Caius, meet with Abrahams, they are concerned that his hiring of a personal professional trainer, Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm), to help him with his running is not quite in keeping with the amateur tradition of the Cambridge gentleman. Implicit in their criticism is an undercurrent of anti-Semitism, one to which Abrahams does not take kindly. It is that moment that defines what makes Abrahams run.This is ultimately a story about faith. With Liddell, it is about his faith in God. With Abrahams, it is about his faith in himself. Both were propelled to Olympic glory by it. It is a story sublimely told, though a little slow at times. It is not an action type of sports movie. It speaks gently of a time long passed, when the Olympics was truly the bastion of amateurs. It is amazing to see track events of the Olympics of 1924 depicted in all their simplicity...no flash, no glitz, no gimmicks. The runners ran on dirt tracks. They all carried spades in which to dig their footholds for their starting ""blocks"", something that surprised me. This attention to detail permeates the entire film, and its evocation of a bygone era makes the film linger in one's memory long after it has ended.Ian Charleson gives a notable performances as Eric Liddell, infusing him with a gentleness and purity of spirit that is compelling, while Ben Cross plays Harold Abrahams with an intensity and singularity of purpose that is riveting. Their stellar performances, as well as those given by the excellent supporting cast, coupled with exquisite cinematography and the excellent direction of Hugh Hudson, make this film worthy of its 1981 Academy Award for Best Picture. The beautiful and soaring, synthesized music of Vangelis also won an Academy Award and went on to become a number one hit in the pop charts in 1982.",5,WHAT MAKES LIDDELL AND ABRAHAMS RUN...,1015113600,"03 3, 2002",2002,3859,"['beautiful', 'film', 'well', 'directed', 'Hugh', 'Hudson', 'theatrical', 'film', 'debut', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'two', 'Olympic', 'runners', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'who', 'ran', 'Great', 'Britain', '1924', 'Olympic', 'Games', 'brought', 'home', 'Gold.The', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'other', 'different', 'can', 'be', 'personal', 'drive', 'reasons', 'running', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'staunch', 'Scot', 'fervid', 'Presbyterian', 'would', 'put', 'John', 'Knox', 'shame', 'son', 'missionary', 'missionary', 'avocation', 'God', 'made', 'fast', 'reason', 'running', 'reconciliation', 'faith', 'passion', 'running', 'glory', 'God', 'faith', 'always', 'constant', 'pre-eminent', 'life', 'devotion', 'controversy', 'Olympics', 'consequence', 'stance', 'when', 'preliminary', 'mete', '200', 'metre', 'race', 'would', 'be', 'held', 'Sunday', 'Liddell', 'simply', 'run', 'Sabbath', 'Luckily', 'Great', 'Britain', 'Lord', 'Andrew', 'Lindsay', 'Nigel', 'Havers', 'gentleman', 'fellow', 'competitor', 'graciously', 'steps', 'had', 'already', 'won', 'gold', 'medal', 'hurdles', 'place', '400', 'metre', 'dash', 'would', 'take', 'place', 'Thursday', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'today', 'dog', 'eat', 'dog', 'world', 'competitive', 'sports', 'much', 'less', 'Olympics', 'today', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'completely', 'different', 'secular', 'Jew', 'Cambridge', 'scholar', 'studies', 'bastion', 'upper', 'crust', 'British', 'society', 'struggling', 'fit', 'always', 'remaining', 'proverbial', 'outsider', 'passion', 'running', 'motivated', 'passion', 'winning', 'world', 'God', 'nothing', 'do', 'Winning', 'merely', 'affirmation', 'world', 'less', 'Jew', 'Consequently', 'desire', 'win', 'superceded', 'only', 'fear', 'losing', 'When', 'two', 'Cambridge', 'dons', 'Master', 'Trinity', 'played', 'late', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Master', 'Caius', 'meet', 'Abrahams', 'are', 'concerned', 'hiring', 'personal', 'professional', 'trainer', 'Sam', 'Mussabini', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'help', 'running', 'not', 'quite', 'keeping', 'amateur', 'tradition', 'Cambridge', 'gentleman', 'Implicit', 'criticism', 'undercurrent', 'anti-Semitism', 'one', 'Abrahams', 'not', 'take', 'kindly', 'moment', 'what', 'Abrahams', 'run.This', 'ultimately', 'story', 'faith', 'Liddell', 'faith', 'God', 'Abrahams', 'faith', 'were', 'propelled', 'Olympic', 'glory', 'story', 'sublimely', 'told', 'little', 'slow', 'times', 'not', 'action', 'type', 'sports', 'movie', 'gently', 'time', 'long', 'passed', 'when', 'Olympics', 'was', 'truly', 'bastion', 'amateurs', 'amazing', 'see', 'track', 'events', 'Olympics', '1924', 'depicted', 'simplicity', 'flash', 'glitz', 'gimmicks', 'runners', 'ran', 'dirt', 'tracks', 'carried', 'spades', 'dig', 'footholds', 'starting', 'blocks', 'something', 'surprised', 'attention', 'detail', 'permeates', 'entire', 'film', 'evocation', 'bygone', 'era', 'film', 'linger', 'one', 'memory', 'long', 'ended.Ian', 'Charleson', 'notable', 'performances', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'infusing', 'gentleness', 'purity', 'spirit', 'compelling', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'intensity', 'singularity', 'purpose', 'riveting', 'stellar', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'given', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'coupled', 'exquisite', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'direction', 'Hugh', 'Hudson', 'make', 'film', 'worthy', '1981', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'beautiful', 'soaring', 'synthesized', 'music', 'Vangelis', 'also', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'went', 'become', 'number', 'one', 'hit', 'pop', 'charts', '1982']",N/A

But of course, that's the story of both men, really, in this magnificient movie about Great Britain's 1924 Olympic track team.  And Abrahams and Liddell, both outside British establishment, are each pursuing their own reasons for ultimate victory. Abrahams is a Jewish man studying at Cambridge, who is angered by the anti-Semitism he encounters even though he tries to fit into Anglican upper crust society. He runs on the desire to show them all that he is the best, in spite of prejudice. He cannot brook disappointment at all. Liddell is a Scottish missionary, a staunch Presbyterian. Some of the reviewers have merely identified him as Protestant, but to understand the opposition he encounters, one must note that as a Scot and a Presbyterian, Liddell is no more a part of the Anglican upper crust than Abrahams. He will have serious decisions to make in Paris regarding the Olympics because of this.  Supporting cast is excellent.  John Gielgud is wonderfully infuriating as one of a pair of Cambridge dons who begrudge the Jewish Abrahams his successes.  Alice Krige, who plays Abrahams operetta star girlfriend, should have gotten more to do after this movie besides the Borg Queen of Star Trek.  And Ian Holm is great as Abrahams' coach, helping him to become one of the earliest modernly trained athletes. One of my most rewarding moments as a college writing professor was the unexpected response of my class to this movie, which they were viewing as the preparation for a compare/contrast essay. Here were students from the Caribbean, from Ivory Coast, from Bensonhurst, and yet they just loved it. Many were athletes and others were fundamentalists, so they really identified with the characters and their plights.

It has been a LONG time since I&#8217;ve seen Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (although I do remember the editing was very crisp and fast and the visual effects were terrific especially the stunt work on the moving truck and of course the horrific ghost climax) so I really should see it again before passing a judgment but I will still back up Chariots of Fire&#8217;s win for Best Picture for four reasons:1. The screenplay is terrific. The dialogue is almost as quotable as The Lord of the Rings or Casablanca and sounds like it was taken straight from a classic novel.a. &#8220;I believe God made me for a purpose but he also made me fast and when I run I feel his pleasure. To give it up would be to hold him in content.&#8221;b. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m chasing. I&#8217;m scared Aubrey. I&#8217;ve known the fear of losing but now I&#8217;m almost too scared to win. I&#8217;ve got only thirty seconds to justify my whole existence. But will I? Will I?c. &#8220;Breathe their faces in. Let them slap you. Like THAT! AND THAT! AND THAT!d. &#8220;Go home to that girl of yours and start some bloody living.

A different god and a different mountaintop.&#8221;It does an outstanding job studying the personalities of two men who are as opposite as the two poles (one is level-headed and humble; the other is prideful and insecure) and what inspires them to take up this particular sport. If EVER a screenwriter deserved his Oscar, Colin Welland did 100%.2. Hugh Hudson&#8217;s direction is flawless. Every scene is well staged and he really brings out the best in every single actor&#8212;even the blond sister and brunette opera singer were good. He really knows how to use camera angles to make a great emotional impact. For example, when Harold is getting a massage and confiding his insecurities to his best friend Aubrey the camera slowly gets closer and closer to his face and then on the &#8220;Justify my existence&#8221; part we get another shot of Aubrey; the utterly confused and worried expression on his face just speaks VOLUMES. One of Hudson&#8217;s finest highlights is the climatic Olympic race. Not when the contestants are running&#8212;just THOSE TWO MINUTES BEFORE the gunshot. The discordant music, the heartbeats, the &#8216;clunk&#8217; of the shovels as they put them away, the close ups of their faces as they crouch down, the shot of the good luck charm dangling.3. The shot composition is terrific. And I&#8217;m not just talking about the iconic beach scene at the beginning and end; I mean the soft, muted colors, the countryside in Ireland and the Renior-esque set-up of Abraham and Sybil&#8217;s first date in the restaurant.Ian Charleson is okay as Eric but it is Ben Cross as the conflicted Harold who really makes the magic of film with his expressions&#8212;especially his eyes. My favorite of his scenes are where he tells the prissy, racist professors off when they belittle him for selecting an Italian/Arab coach and of course the &#8216;massage scene&#8217; soliloquy to Aubrey. Ian Holm does an outstanding job as the cantankerous but good-hearted coach, Sam Mussabini. He adds just the right amount of wit, spark and humor. The scenes where he slaps Harold during the slideshow, &#8216;hat popping&#8217; in his apartment and drunken soliloquy after the Olympics in the restaurant are hilarious. And of course the epic line delivery of &#8220;Get up lad!

94921,A129YBX5BVNW2,0790731010,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[11, 11]","*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE USA 'BOOK PACK' BLU RAY REISSUE and THE 2 UK VARIANTS ***Little will prepare fans of ""Chariots Of Fire"" for this BLU RAY reissue - the picture quality is SENSATIONAL - and for a British film made on a budget in 1981 - that says a lot. Also - re-watching it in 2012 (the year of the 30th Olympiad in England) - it's nice to find that this homage to Sporting achievement and human spirit hasn't lost any of its capacity to stir the soul and bring a tear to the eye. It was nominated for 7 Oscars at the time and won 4 - including Best Picture.PACKAGING/CONTENT/PICTURE QUALITY:The first thing to note is that even though the print quality and abundant extras are the same for the UK and US versions - they differ greatly in their 'packaging' and there's actually 3 variants of the BLU RAY to choose from. The UK issue comes in two versions - a simple uninspiring plastic clip-case with just 1 disc at around ten pounds (type in barcode 5039036052344 into the Amazon Search Bar) and a second issue with the music CD as well for a few quid more (type in barcode 5039036051163).This US Warner Brothers version (at about twenty pounds) that I'm reviewing however comes in a beautifully presented 36-page embossed hardback 'Book Pack' (or Digibook as its sometimes called) with an outer page attached to the rear (type in barcode 883929093946 into Amazon). Regardless of which issue you buy or where you live - ALL are 'REGION FREE' - so will play on every machine.The booklet for the US variant is beautiful - featuring articles and pictures on Producer David Puttnam, Director Hugh Hudson and Writer Colin Welland. There's also text and photos on the principal cast members as well as notable supporting roles by John Gielgud, Ian Holm, Alice Krieg and Cheryl Campbell. There's also a page on the huge contribution made by Greek keyboardist VANGELIS - whose musical score has been both revered and parodied in equal measure ever since (most notably in the opening ceremony for the 2012 London Olympics just a few days ago).This US issue and the UK double also house a 4-track music CD by VANGELIS (13:47 minutes) that features 2006 remasters of ""Titles"" (A Number 1 US hit in February 1982), ""Abraham's Theme"", ""Eric's Theme"" and ""Jerusalem"" (Vangelis with The Ambrosian Singers).But the big news is the print - which has been FULLY RESTORED and defaulted to 1.85:1 aspect ratio - thereby filling your entire screen. Even in the notoriously difficult-to-light indoor sequences there is only slight blocking and grain - but on all outdoor scenes (of which there are many) - the clarity is exemplary. The DTS-HD Master Audio is English 5.1 Dolby Digital and Subtitles are English for Hard-Of-Hearing and French. Extras are discussed below...THE FILM:Taking its name from William Blake's preface to the epic ""Milton: A Poem"" - it focuses on the team who secured 4 medals for Britain in the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris - in particular the two Gold winners - Eric Liddell for the Men's 400 metres and Harold Abrahams for the Men's 100 meters. Nicholas Farrell (as Aubrey Montague), Nigel Havers (as Lord Andrew Lindsay) and Daniel Gerroll (as Henry Stallard) make up the other runners. Blink and you'll miss them cameos are - two sightings of American Comedienne Ruby Wax as a lady spectator in the Olympic crowds towards the end of the movie and an uncredited Stephen Fry in the ""HMS Pinafore"" chorus line-up.Born in China but raised in Edinburgh - Eric Liddell (nick-named ""The Flying Scotsman"" after the famous steam train) was the son of a devout Missionary - and like his father before him cherished and practiced his religious convictions. Played to perfection by Scotsman Ian Charleson - Liddell often said that he was 'running for God' or 'felt His pleasure' as he speeded around track after track leaving all in his wake. Both King and Country would sorely test these implacable beliefs in Paris when they asked him to run on the Sabbath - and he refused. A little jiggering of racing dates saved face and the day...but it was the measure of the man that he withstood all that pressure and still won...His principal rival was Harold Abrahams (played with huge gusto by Ben Cross) - a Jewish Cambridge University intellectual determined to deal with society's bigotry towards his kind by crushing all detractors in his path - including Liddell - whom he both feared and admired. But when he finally faces Liddell in a run and looses by a ticker-tape inch - the outsider is crushed. But help is at hand in the shape of an unorthodox Jewish coach called Sam Mussabini (a fabulous turn by veteran actor Ian Holm) who promises to make Harold faster and better (and does).These indomitable boors inhabit a world of privileged chums wearing boater hats and striped blazers - men who sing Gilbert & Sullivan's ""HMS Pinafore"" songs with alarming relish. This is Britain after the senseless generation-depleting butchery of World War I - but still with that inbred sense of Empire coursing through their veins. You'd be right in thinking that all this snobbish elitism could become quickly tedious (and it threatens to do so for the first half hour), but the script rightly concentrates on something all the more compelling - their dedication, self-sacrifice and guts. Genuinely inspiring a country hungry for something noble to celebrate - you could even say that these athletes joined Christianity and Judaism on the Sports field for the National good. And on it goes to the 8th Olympics Games in 1924 and a funeral in London in 1978 (making it contemporary).The wad of extras are superb - modern day interviews with all the protagonists - Ben Cross and Nigel Havers particularly animated and witty and pouring praise on Ian Charleson who sadly passed away in 1990. And again when they use the old stock footage of the film - you see just how glorious the full restoration truly is.Like ""The King's Speech"" in so many ways - ""Chariots Of Fire"" is filled with British pride - but in a good way. This is a story about people worth remembering - their struggles - their heartbreaks and triumphs - their journey. Having not seen it in probably 30 years - I found it moving, inspirational and not in the least bit dated. And now it has the transfer and format it deserves. I know the US version may cost twice as much as the UK issue - but if you can go the few quid - then do so.When Screenplay Writer Colin Welland accepted his Oscar - he famously announced ""The British Are Coming!"" Well, they're back...because this really is a fantastic reissue of a great movie.I'm off now to run in slow motion by the sea and surf with that synth riff pounding through my very tight Speedos...oh

94922,A6DMQ1ZU7YS9O,0790731010,"Matthew Higdon ""California Chariot""","[3, 4]","Garnering four Academy Awards including Best Picture, Hugh Hudson's debut theatrical feature, CHARIOTS OF FIRE, chronicles the inspiring true story of Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell, bringing the two runners' striving for gold to the limelight of Britain's 1924 Olympic track-and-field efforts.Abrahams, both confident Cambridge student and self-consciously Jewish, runs ""to win,"" to be the best. To that end, he takes on the professional training of Sam Mussabini. His quest takes him through the ranks of Britain's finest runners (including Eric Liddell) and one reluctantly supportive showbiz girlfriend ... right up to the fore of the very fastest competition in the world (Jackson Scholtz, Charles Paddock), culminating in a triumphant Parisian showdown to bring him a hard-earned medal.Liddell, son of Scottish missionaries, ""runs for God."" His sister, on the other hand, believes his love for running will quench any intentions to follow in his father's footsteps and return to their Chinese mission. When he discovers that the qualifying heat is to be run on the Lord's day, it runs in conflict with his principles (no pun intended), putting his own love for God to the test. And when the 400 meters opens up, he is given one final opportunity ""to make the world stand back in wonder.""A few historical inaccuracies notwithstanding, the movie reenacts the timeless tale of two men - each driven by different forces, toward different goals - and each of whom must triumph by following his own heart and convictions, making the drama all the richer for it. Strong performances by all. A story of focus, principle, honor, sportsmanship, and God-before-king mentality, CHARIOTS OF FIRE is a masterpiece from start to finish.",5,Outstanding Film!

It' hard to believe that this film is now over 30 years old but with this superb new Warner Restoration on blu ray, it's looks like it was filmed yesterday. If you ask most people today if they remember what the film was about chances are you'll get blank stares. The most memoriable scenes to most people are the opening and closing shots of a group of Cambridge students running along the beach as the surf hits them while the ""Chariots of Fire"" theme music by Vangelis swirls around them. Though some liberties were taken in the film concerning Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell, all in all it's a very inspirational film and was the surprise Best Picture winner at the 1981 Oscars beating out ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""On Golden Pond"", ""Atlantic City"" and the odds on favorite, Warren Beatty's ""Reds"". Except for ""Raiders"" most of these films are not remembered as fondly as ""Chariots of Fire"". As far as the actual 1924 Olympics go, American swimmers Johnny Weissmuller(""Tarzan"") and Duke Kahanamoku(of surfing legend) won more Olympic medals than the two British protagonists in the film. But winning medals wasn't the message the Producer(David Putnam) or Director(Hugh Hudson) wanted to convey. Hope, inspiration, and the human spirit are on display here and those qualities are brought out in this new Blu ray edition from Warners. First of all, the picture quality is just stunning and a major improvement over the 2004 two-disc DVD release. The colors in the film are a standout now, especially the Oscar winning costumes. Blu ray has brought out details that viewers may have missed when they watched the film before. That was certainly true with me. That is really apparent with the march of the Olympic athletes into the Olympic stadium. Every color in the national flags of each country just pops off the screen. The sound has been upgraded too, although at times it's hard to make out what some of the actors are saying. This is not the fault of the music by Vangelis, although it sometimes can be annoying. Vangelis won an Oscar for his music in the film and it's instantly recognizable along with the opening themes of ""Jaws"" and ""Rocky"" just to mention a few. There are at least three new featurettes with this new blu ray along with all of the ones from the 2004 edition. The digibook itself is very informative and includes a CD sampler of Vangelis music from the film. This blu ray digibook from Warners is a welcome edition to their previous editions such as ""Meet Me in St. Louis"", ""North by Northwest"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"". I have high hopes for the upcoming blu ray digibook of ""Empire of the Sun"", one of my favorite Speilberg films.

Beautiful performances, sensitive direction and a moving story all add up to pure pleasure for the movie goer.The 2 Disc Edition features interesting bonus materials, especially an excellent commentary track with the modest director.  It's especially remarkable in the modern era of CGI effects, stratospheric actors salaries and production constraints...this could never be made today!  Oddly enough, there is no mention of its Executive Producer, Dodi Fayed, who has become such an iconic ppop culture figure since his death in the Paris car crash with Lady Diana.Interestingly, lots of fuss is made over the memorable Vangelis soundtrack which people still hum when they run on a beach.  To me, however, it is the only aspect of the motion picture which jars me from total enjoyment--that synthesize is so identifiably 1980's that is removes me from the timeless aspect of everything else.

94927,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,0790731010,Nix Pix,"[16, 16]","""Chariots of Fire"" (1981) is a riveting biography told in flashback about two congenial buddies and budding British track stars, Harold M. Abrahams (Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) who are set to compete in the 1924 Summer Olympics. Eric, a devout Scottish missionary, pledges his victory to God. Harold, a Jewish student from Cambridge, seeks fame and the chance to escape prejudice. Both are cocky, razor sharp and defiantly patriotic. Neither is willing to concede defeat. While other sports films (Rocky, Field of Dreams, Hoosiers) tend to go for the gusto in a prerequisite finish of bru-ha and flag waving, ""Chariots"" arguably goes for the gut, because director Hugh Hudson has correctly determined that it is in the gut where heroes and legends are born to flourish. This film plays like a vintage news reel, brought vividly to life. Its passion for deriving grandeur from the everyday, rather than transforming the every day into the grandeose, is precisely where the film most brilliantly succeeds.Colin Welland's script is a masterful tapestry that fully explores the private demons and public destiny of these two titans. It poignantly captures the agony and the ecstacy of competition in the face of an uncertain and defiant world. What is even more remarkable about ""Chariots of Fire"" is that it lacks a singular star turn to buttress its seemingly straight forward plot, and yet there are star caliber performances riddled throughout. The acting is superb - particularly Ian Charleson's Eric Liddell; an incarnation of subtle masculine beauty that is marked and contrasted through his considerable ease and joy in running competitively against the emotionally raw and physically tortured Abrahams - the other outstanding acting acheivement of this or any other year. As prospective love interests, Cheryl Campbell (Jennie Liddell) and Alice Krige (Sybil Gordon) add to the air of documentary style that develops this film into its epic race-to-the-finish-line finale. Sam Mussabini's (Ian Holm) reaction to that final high note of victory is memorable and will leave even the most cynical of cinema critics with a lump in their throat.A note to remember when viewing films based on real life for historical accuracy: Due to the refusal of several key participants to lend their real names to the film, director, Hugh Hudson was forced to take artistic liberties with two key characters; that of Watson (Stephen Mallatratt) who was in fact was Arthur Porritt, father to environmentalist Jonathan Porritt, and Lord Andrew Lindsay (Nigel Havers) who is actually a knock off of Lord Burghley.Warner Home Video's DVD is, at long last, a reason to get excited. The previously issued release of this contemporary classic was bare bones and NOT widescreen. Both shortcomings have been rectified on this 2-disc special edition. The image quality on this anamorphically enhanced and newly remastered disc is outstanding. Colors are rich and vibrant, capturing all the subtle palette of nuances in the original cinematography. Blacks are solid, rich and deep. Whites are sharp and clean. Occasionally flesh tones will appear somewhat pasty or a bit too orange but these momentary lapses in color do not distract from the lush and lovely presentation. Fine detail is fully realized throughout. Only during the slow-motion photography do details tend to look a tad soft. The audio has been remastered into a 5.1 sound mix that is dated but really shines during the race sequences. Occasionally dialogue sounds strident or too frontal but again, this is a soundtrack from the early 80s. Extras include a very interesting commentary track by Hugh Hudson, a newly produced documentary, ""Wings on Their Heels: The Making of Chariots of Fire"", ""Chariots of Fire - A Reunion"" in which key cast members reunite to discuss the film's impact on both their careers and on cinema,  seven deleted scenes and some actor's screen tests. Bottom line: ""Chariots of Fire"" is thrilling entertainment, poignantly realized and destined to become a classic. It's reintroduction on DVD - properly formatted and completely realized - has been long overdue but has been well worth the wait!",5,ON THE WINGS OF EAGLES - CHARIOTS SOARS TO VICTORY ON DVD!,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,4179,"['Chariots', 'Fire', '1981', 'riveting', 'biography', 'told', 'flashback', 'two', 'congenial', 'buddies', 'budding', 'British', 'track', 'stars', 'Harold', 'M.', 'Abrahams', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'who', 'are', 'set', 'compete', '1924', 'Summer', 'Olympics', 'Eric', 'devout', 'Scottish', 'missionary', 'victory', 'God', 'Harold', 'Jewish', 'student', 'Cambridge', 'fame', 'chance', 'escape', 'prejudice', 'are', 'cocky', 'razor', 'sharp', 'defiantly', 'patriotic', 'willing', 'concede', 'defeat', 'other', 'sports', 'films', 'Rocky', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'Hoosiers', 'tend', 'go', 'gusto', 'prerequisite', 'finish', 'bru-ha', 'flag', 'waving', 'Chariots', 'arguably', 'gut', 'director', 'Hugh', 'Hudson', 'correctly', 'determined', 'gut', 'where', 'heroes', 'legends', 'are', 'born', 'flourish', 'film', 'vintage', 'news', 'reel', 'brought', 'vividly', 'life', 'passion', 'deriving', 'grandeur', 'everyday', 'rather', 'transforming', 'day', 'grandeose', 'precisely', 'where', 'film', 'most', 'brilliantly', 'succeeds.Colin', 'Welland', 'script', 'masterful', 'tapestry', 'fully', 'private', 'demons', 'public', 'destiny', 'two', 'titans', 'poignantly', 'agony', 'ecstacy', 'competition', 'face', 'uncertain', 'defiant', 'world', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'remarkable', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'singular', 'star', 'turn', 'buttress', 'seemingly', 'straight', 'forward', 'plot', 'yet', 'are', 'star', 'caliber', 'performances', 'riddled', 'acting', 'superb', 'particularly', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'incarnation', 'subtle', 'masculine', 'beauty', 'marked', 'contrasted', 'considerable', 'ease', 'joy', 'running', 'competitively', 'emotionally', 'raw', 'physically', 'tortured', 'Abrahams', 'other', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'acheivement', 'other', 'year', 'prospective', 'love', 'interests', 'Cheryl', 'Campbell', 'Jennie', 'Liddell', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'Sybil', 'Gordon', 'add', 'air', 'documentary', 'style', 'film', 'epic', 'race-to-the-finish-line', 'finale', 'Sam', 'Mussabini', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'reaction', 'final', 'high', 'note', 'victory', 'memorable', 'will', 'leave', 'even', 'most', 'cynical', 'cinema', 'critics', 'lump', 'throat.A', 'note', 'remember', 'when', 'viewing', 'films', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Due', 'refusal', 'several', 'key', 'participants', 'lend', 'real', 'names', 'film', 'director', 'Hugh', 'Hudson', 'was', 'forced', 'take', 'artistic', 'liberties', 'two', 'key', 'characters', 'Watson', 'Stephen', 'Mallatratt', 'who', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'Arthur', 'Porritt', 'father', 'environmentalist', 'Jonathan', 'Porritt', 'Lord', 'Andrew', 'Lindsay', 'Nigel', 'Havers', 'who', 'actually', 'knock', 'Lord', 'Burghley.Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'DVD', 'long', 'last', 'reason', 'get', 'excited', 'previously', 'issued', 'release', 'contemporary', 'classic', 'was', 'bare', 'bones', 'NOT', 'widescreen', 'shortcomings', 'have', 'been', 'rectified', '2-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'image', 'quality', 'anamorphically', 'enhanced', 'newly', 'remastered', 'disc', 'outstanding', 'Colors', 'are', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'capturing', 'subtle', 'palette', 'nuances', 'original', 'cinematography', 'Blacks', 'are', 'solid', 'rich', 'deep', 'Whites', 'are', 'sharp', 'clean', 'Occasionally', 'flesh', 'tones', 'will', 'appear', 'somewhat', 'pasty', 'bit', 'too', 'orange', 'momentary', 'lapses', 'color', 'do', 'not', 'distract', 'lush', 'lovely', 'presentation', 'Fine', 'detail', 'fully', 'realized', 'Only', 'slow-motion', 'photography', 'do', 'details', 'tend', 'look', 'tad', 'soft', 'audio', 'been', 'remastered', '5.1', 'sound', 'mix', 'dated', 'really', 'shines', 'race', 'sequences', 'Occasionally', 'dialogue', 'sounds', 'strident', 'too', 'frontal', 'again', 'soundtrack', 'early', '80s', 'Extras', 'include', 'very', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'track', 'Hugh', 'Hudson', 'newly', 'produced', 'documentary', 'Wings', 'Their', 'Heels', 'Making', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'Reunion', 'key', 'cast', 'members', 'reunite', 'discuss', 'film', 'impact', 'careers', 'cinema', 'seven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'actor', 'screen', 'tests', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'thrilling', 'entertainment', 'poignantly', 'realized', 'destined', 'become', 'classic', 'reintroduction', 'DVD', 'properly', 'formatted', 'completely', 'realized', 'been', 'long', 'overdue', 'been', 'well', 'wait']",N/A
94928,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,0790731010,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[2, 4]","***The new 2012 digital film transfer***This is a cleaned up re-release of the 1981 film and not in any sense a directors' cut. No scenes have been altered, but the film has been cleaned up, enhanced and digitised. Judging by Amazon reviews of the pre-2012 edition, the celluloid was in bad shape: the ""enhancements"" are not in themselves remarkable but they do make Chariots of Fire perfectly watchable now. The ambient soundtrack and dialogue remains something less than THX certified 7.1 surround sound, though Vangelis' ethereal score sounds better than ever.***The Film itself***Chariots of Fire is an old-fashioned melodrama rendered sublime by music. The music comes in three varieties, two of which are wildly anachronistic: Vangelis' square-waved futurism dominates (a style not unlike his subsequent work on Blade Runner) but there are frequent snatches of sacred choral music: Allegri's Miserere, an a capella Magnificat and, and the end, Parry and Blake's Jerusalem whence the film takes its name.Afloat on this musical seascape, the film manages to portray the personal as aspirational - even ineffable - and heartily transcends its really rather cluttered screenplay.Sometimes these small details don't matter, but it is still true that Chariots of Fire is confused as to its protagonists and antagonists.The early sequences are narrated through Aubrey Montague's (Nicholas Farrell) letters home from training camp. It is Montague's athletic form on which the screenplay opens, striding manfully down the beach at Broadstairs, leading the British cohort. But it is not his film. On his shoulder, mud-spattered and grinning like a labrador with its head out a car window, is Lord Lindsay (Havers). It isn't his film either. Eventually Hudson shifts his fulcrum, and we settle on Harold Abrahams (Cross) and Liddell (Charleson) as the protagonists, and quietly wonder why Aubrey and Lindsay are in the picture at all.Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) is a bit of a conundrum too. One moment neurotic, driven relentlessly by perceived slights delivered soundlessly within the privileged circles through which he moves. The next a bon-vivant extrovert, thumping out G&S; show tunes to the delight of those very same lords and ladies. Abrahams fancies himself as an outsider, but everywhere he is accepted plainly for who, and not what, he is.The real outsider is Eric Liddell (Charleson). Outwardly a Boys' Own hero: international rugby winger; champion sprinter - but at heart a stubborn, teetotal methodist evangelist. In early dispatches we see much of his divine countenance, in tweed, shining forth upon clouded (Scottish) hills. Later he tries to build Jerusalem among the satanic mills of The British Olympic Association by refusing to run on the Sabbath. The Olympic grandees want him to run for the glory of the King, religion be damned. Liddell will have none of it. It is left to Lindsay to construct a clever, face-saving solution; but it defuses what might have been powerful drama.The collision of Abraham's irresistible force with Liddell's immovable object should surely be the central drama, but it too is largely fluffed: they do race in an early exchange - the desolate aftermath of which Vangelis memorably captures to the beat of folding grandstand seats - but by the final climax they are best chums, and in their stead a brace of under-explained Americans are shipped in as antagonists.Those final, dramatic race scenes are filmed curiously, as if Hudson means to deflate rather than pump the tension. The celebrated slow-motion shots follow only after the whole race has been run without much fanfare. Nonetheless when they come, accompanied as they are by the Vangelis' outstanding score - these sequences are mesmerising enough to support the film's ambition.I remember being swept away by Chariots of Fire in 1981: I was 11. I felt less like that in 2012, but the film retains plenty of emotional punch, and boasts so many iconic images, that it surely has a permanent place in the cinema history of this green and pleasant land.Olly Buxton",4,A melodrama rendered sublime by music: 2012 redux,1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,4071,"['***The', 'new', '2012', 'digital', 'film', 'transfer***This', 'cleaned', 'up', 're-release', '1981', 'film', 'not', 'sense', 'directors', 'cut', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'altered', 'film', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'enhanced', 'digitised', 'Judging', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'pre-2012', 'edition', 'celluloid', 'was', 'bad', 'shape', 'enhancements', 'are', 'not', 'remarkable', 'do', 'make', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'perfectly', 'watchable', 'now', 'ambient', 'soundtrack', 'dialogue', 'something', 'less', 'THX', 'certified', '7.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'Vangelis', 'ethereal', 'score', 'better', 'ever', '***The', 'Film', 'itself***Chariots', 'Fire', 'old-fashioned', 'melodrama', 'rendered', 'sublime', 'music', 'music', 'three', 'varieties', 'two', 'are', 'wildly', 'anachronistic', 'Vangelis', 'square-waved', 'futurism', 'dominates', 'style', 'not', 'subsequent', 'work', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'are', 'frequent', 'snatches', 'sacred', 'choral', 'music', 'Allegri', 'Miserere', 'capella', 'Magnificat', 'end', 'Parry', 'Blake', 'Jerusalem', 'whence', 'film', 'name.Afloat', 'musical', 'seascape', 'film', 'portray', 'personal', 'aspirational', 'even', 'ineffable', 'heartily', 'really', 'rather', 'cluttered', 'screenplay.Sometimes', 'small', 'details', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'still', 'true', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'confused', 'protagonists', 'antagonists.The', 'early', 'sequences', 'are', 'narrated', 'Aubrey', 'Montague', 'Nicholas', 'Farrell', 'letters', 'home', 'training', 'camp', 'Montague', 'athletic', 'form', 'screenplay', 'striding', 'manfully', 'down', 'beach', 'Broadstairs', 'leading', 'British', 'cohort', 'not', 'film', 'shoulder', 'mud-spattered', 'grinning', 'labrador', 'head', 'car', 'window', 'Lord', 'Lindsay', 'Havers', ""n't"", 'film', 'Eventually', 'Hudson', 'shifts', 'fulcrum', 'settle', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'Cross', 'Liddell', 'Charleson', 'protagonists', 'quietly', 'wonder', 'why', 'Aubrey', 'Lindsay', 'are', 'picture', 'all.Harold', 'Abrahams', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'bit', 'conundrum', 'too', 'One', 'moment', 'neurotic', 'driven', 'relentlessly', 'perceived', 'slights', 'delivered', 'soundlessly', 'privileged', 'circles', 'next', 'bon-vivant', 'extrovert', 'thumping', 'out', 'G', 'S', 'show', 'delight', 'very', 'same', 'lords', 'ladies', 'Abrahams', 'outsider', 'everywhere', 'accepted', 'plainly', 'who', 'not', 'what', 'real', 'outsider', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'Charleson', 'Outwardly', 'Boys', 'Own', 'hero', 'international', 'rugby', 'winger', 'champion', 'sprinter', 'heart', 'stubborn', 'teetotal', 'methodist', 'evangelist', 'early', 'dispatches', 'see', 'much', 'divine', 'countenance', 'tweed', 'shining', 'forth', 'clouded', 'Scottish', 'hills', 'Later', 'build', 'Jerusalem', 'satanic', 'mills', 'British', 'Olympic', 'Association', 'refusing', 'run', 'Sabbath', 'Olympic', 'grandees', 'want', 'run', 'glory', 'King', 'religion', 'be', 'damned', 'Liddell', 'will', 'have', 'none', 'left', 'Lindsay', 'construct', 'clever', 'face-saving', 'solution', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'powerful', 'drama.The', 'collision', 'Abraham', 'irresistible', 'force', 'Liddell', 'immovable', 'object', 'should', 'surely', 'be', 'central', 'drama', 'too', 'largely', 'fluffed', 'do', 'race', 'early', 'exchange', 'desolate', 'aftermath', 'Vangelis', 'memorably', 'beat', 'folding', 'grandstand', 'seats', 'final', 'climax', 'are', 'best', 'chums', 'stead', 'brace', 'under-explained', 'Americans', 'are', 'shipped', 'as', 'antagonists.Those', 'final', 'dramatic', 'race', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'curiously', 'Hudson', 'deflate', 'rather', 'pump', 'tension', 'celebrated', 'slow-motion', 'shots', 'follow', 'only', 'whole', 'race', 'been', 'run', 'much', 'fanfare', 'Nonetheless', 'when', 'come', 'accompanied', 'are', 'Vangelis', 'outstanding', 'score', 'sequences', 'are', 'mesmerising', 'enough', 'support', 'film', 'ambition.I', 'remember', 'being', 'swept', 'away', 'Chariots', 'Fire', '1981', 'was', '11', 'felt', 'less', '2012', 'film', 'plenty', 'emotional', 'punch', 'so', 'many', 'iconic', 'images', 'surely', 'permanent', 'place', 'cinema', 'history', 'green', 'pleasant', 'land.Olly', 'Buxton']",N/A

94931,A10Q9K1MNTSAES,0790731010,Paul P. Heffernan,"[6, 6]","Chariots of Fire [Blu-ray Book]Back in 1981 I saw this wonderful, inspirational movie at the cinema and have loved it ever since. I bought each DVD release as they came out but was surprised to discover that the ballroom scene of a cricket match between the main characters had been replaced by a scene of the students arriving at a railway station and boarding transport to get to the University with the assistance of some disabled ex-servicemen. This was so on releases from the US or UK and in Australia also. Laudable as this issue of the possibly unfair or inhumane treatment of the war-wounded may be, it does not fit into the ethos of the movie or to a more complete understanding of the character and behaviour of the Olympic hopefuls. The interactions between the players in the ballroom serves to illustrate some aspects of their attitudes and characters and is therefore a much more valuable scene to include. It is significant that it WAS part of the original theatrical Oscar-winning release. I have no idea why all subsequent DVD releases of the movie had this railway station scene included instead of the original cricket match.With the kind assistance of one of amazon.UK's star reviewers, Mark Barry, I was able to find out that the ballroom scene had been restored to the UK release of the BluRay in place of the railway arrival scene whereas it is NOT included as an integral part of the film in the US BluRay presentation. I now have the UK disc as well and am utterly delighted with it. I give great credit to David Puttnam for having the courage and discernment to restore the movie to its original theatrical form for the UK version at least. I will never play the US version again and advise prospective purchasers to consider if the substantial price difference just to get a booklet containing some admittedly beautiful photos is worth buying. If I had known about the restoration of the content of the original movie in the UK release then I would not have shelled out for the high-priced US version.",4,Ballroom (cricket) scene is missing from the main movie!,1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,2029,"['Chariots', 'Fire', '[', 'Blu-ray', 'Book', ']', 'Back', '1981', 'saw', 'wonderful', 'inspirational', 'movie', 'cinema', 'have', 'loved', 'ever', 'bought', 'DVD', 'release', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'surprised', 'discover', 'ballroom', 'scene', 'cricket', 'match', 'main', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'replaced', 'scene', 'students', 'arriving', 'railway', 'station', 'boarding', 'transport', 'get', 'University', 'assistance', 'disabled', 'ex-servicemen', 'was', 'so', 'releases', 'US', 'UK', 'Australia', 'also', 'Laudable', 'issue', 'possibly', 'unfair', 'inhumane', 'treatment', 'war-wounded', 'may', 'be', 'not', 'fit', 'ethos', 'movie', 'more', 'complete', 'understanding', 'character', 'behaviour', 'Olympic', 'hopefuls', 'interactions', 'players', 'ballroom', 'illustrate', 'aspects', 'attitudes', 'characters', 'therefore', 'much', 'more', 'valuable', 'scene', 'include', 'significant', 'WAS', 'part', 'original', 'theatrical', 'Oscar-winning', 'release', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'subsequent', 'DVD', 'releases', 'movie', 'had', 'railway', 'station', 'scene', 'included', 'instead', 'original', 'cricket', 'match.With', 'kind', 'assistance', 'one', 'amazon.UK', 'star', 'reviewers', 'Mark', 'Barry', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'out', 'ballroom', 'scene', 'had', 'been', 'restored', 'UK', 'release', 'BluRay', 'place', 'railway', 'arrival', 'scene', 'NOT', 'included', 'integral', 'part', 'film', 'US', 'BluRay', 'presentation', 'now', 'have', 'UK', 'disc', 'as', 'well', 'am', 'utterly', 'delighted', 'give', 'great', 'credit', 'David', 'Puttnam', 'having', 'courage', 'discernment', 'restore', 'movie', 'original', 'theatrical', 'form', 'UK', 'version', 'least', 'will', 'never', 'play', 'US', 'version', 'again', 'advise', 'prospective', 'purchasers', 'consider', 'substantial', 'price', 'difference', 'just', 'get', 'booklet', 'containing', 'admittedly', 'beautiful', 'photos', 'worth', 'buying', 'had', 'known', 'restoration', 'content', 'original', 'movie', 'UK', 'release', 'then', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'shelled', 'out', 'high-priced', 'US', 'version']",N/A

94933,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,0790731010,P Magnum,"[20, 21]","Chariots Of Fire tells the dual real life stories of two runners in 1920's Great Britain who overcame obstacles in life to win gold medals at the 1924 Paris Olympics.  Ben Cross is Harold Abrams a Jew whose background has made him doubly determined to become the fastest runner in the world.  He carries a grudge against society and not only does he race to beat his competitors, but the world as well.  He is unrelenting and second place is not an option.  He goes to Cambridge and makes friends with fellow runners Aubrey Montague and Lord Andrew Lindsay.  Ian Charleston is Eric Liddell a Scotsman who is the son of a religious missionary.  He runs not out of a desire to be the best as Abrams does, but because he feels God's pleasure.  He says to his disapproving sister that God made him fast for a reason and when he runs he is praising His glory.  Abrams and Liddell face off in a race in the middle of the film and Liddell prevails.  This haunts Abrams as he had never lost before and he enlists the aid of a professional coach, played by Ian Holm, to train him.  Mr. Holm plays the role as a delightful curmudgeon and adds a little levity to the film.  Both men, as well as Lindsey and Montague, make the Olympic team.  There is some controversy as Liddell finds out the preliminaries for the 200 yard dash which he is competing in are taking place on the Sabbath.  He refuses to race, as it is a sin, thus sparking trouble.  Lord Lindsay jumps to rescue, giving up his spot in the 400 as he already won his medal in the hurdles.  The film took some heat for this bit of poetic license as in real live, Liddell knew of the situation weeks before the Olympics and the change was made well in advance of the race without the all the fervor the film depicts.  That aside, the movie is a gripping, engrossing story of two seemingly different men, who in the end have more in common than we think.  It shows personal triumphs in spite of shackles that would hold lesser men down.  The film won a surprising 1981 Best Picture Oscar over the heavily favored Reds as well as one for Vangelis' memorable score (the main title became a number one hit for Vangelis in 1982).

It is a tale of two men who have completely different motivations for success.  One man, a Scottish missionary, is motivated by his faith.  Talking of God, he says that he ""feel(s) His pleasure"" when he is running.  The other man, a British student who happens to be Jewish, is motivated to achieve for his own glory.  The aspect of his being a Jew gives the viewer a sense of his isolation from others and the film does bring out the prejudice he encounters.  However, he seems to always want to step back when his comrades in track try to bring him into their circle.  As the story line is developed, we see the way failure is handled by both men and, ultimately, how success is handled as well.  There is a very Christian message in this film but it is not a ""Christian"" film.  When glory exists in winning, it is temporal.  When glory exists in devotion to a higher being, it is eternal.

94950,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,0790731010,Roger J. Buffington,"[2, 4]","This is a truly timeless film of human courage and determination.  It is set in Britain in the period shortly after the First World War, and deals with the Olympic training and preparations of two great runners: Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddel.  Abrahams, a secular Jew, attends Cambridge, and illustrates that despite the English class structure, the upper crust of England is open to a determined outsider if he or she has enough ability.  Eric Liddel is a fervent Presbyterian, motivated by his religion, who eventually becomes a missionary in the footsteps of his father.  He is, as one of his supporters explains, a &quot;muscular Christian.&quot;  But the theme of this film is what makes these two men run.  For Abrahams, his running is his quest for excellence--in effect he is taking on (and beating) those who would hold him back from his goals of success and personal prestige.  For Liddel, running is an affirmation of his love of Christ and his faith.  Although the two men are very different, and motivated by very different things, in the end both are shown to be good men in a bygone age when such things as true amateurs still existed.The film is beautifully done.  Its attention to detail and wonderful cinematography literally transport the viewer to the period of the 1920s--a simpler time, but a time not without its complexities.  Ian Charleson is absolutely wonderful as Eric Liddel, and Ben Cross presents a superb performance as Harold Abrahams.  The musical score by Vangelis is incredibly good, and perfectly captures the theme and tone of this fabulous film.  The supporting cast all turn in fine performances.The film does slow down a bit at certain points, and contains a bit of extraneous material.  For example, Abraham's romance with the opera singer doesn't seem to have any real point to it, although perhaps it further illustrates that Abrahams has successfully managed to become a part of the English upper class.  Not many athletes attend the opera these days!  Overall, though, the movie moves along at a reasonably brisk pace, although with numerous leisurely interludes here and there.  It slows down at points, but never drags.  It holds the viewer's interest at all times.The scene in which Liddel falls, recovers, and wins his race is one of my favorite scenes of any film ever, and it perfectly depicts the fact that, as Abraham's coach says, Liddel runs on guts, and draws his strength from within (or, as Liddel would have said, from his faith in God).  The film's depiction of the American Olympic track team was hilarious, and I thought it perfectly captured how we Americans are often viewed by the Brits...a little brash and unpolished, very determined and competent, but in the end, as friends.  The scene near the end involving Jackson Schultz (the &quot;New York Thunderbolt&quot;) and Eric Liddel was touching, and done just right.I agree with other reviewers who have noted that the DVD should have been done on the wide letterbox format.  Perhaps a re-release is something we can look forward to in future years.  I trust that this film will always be available on DVD, for it truly belongs in every movie afficianado's film library.This is a truly great movie that has aged beautifully and remains a timeless classic.  It will always be among my very favorite of films.",5,A timeless and moving tale of human determination.,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,3327,"['truly', 'timeless', 'film', 'human', 'courage', 'determination', 'set', 'Britain', 'period', 'shortly', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'deals', 'Olympic', 'training', 'preparations', 'two', 'great', 'runners', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'Eric', 'Liddel', 'Abrahams', 'secular', 'Jew', 'Cambridge', 'English', 'class', 'structure', 'upper', 'crust', 'England', 'open', 'determined', 'outsider', 'enough', 'ability', 'Eric', 'Liddel', 'fervent', 'Presbyterian', 'motivated', 'religion', 'who', 'eventually', 'missionary', 'footsteps', 'father', 'one', 'supporters', 'quot', 'muscular', 'Christian.', 'quot', 'theme', 'film', 'what', 'two', 'men', 'run', 'Abrahams', 'running', 'quest', 'excellence', 'effect', 'taking', 'beating', 'who', 'would', 'hold', 'back', 'goals', 'success', 'personal', 'prestige', 'Liddel', 'running', 'affirmation', 'love', 'Christ', 'faith', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'motivated', 'very', 'different', 'things', 'end', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'good', 'men', 'bygone', 'age', 'when', 'such', 'things', 'true', 'amateurs', 'still', 'existed.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'done', 'attention', 'detail', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'literally', 'transport', 'viewer', 'period', '1920s', 'simpler', 'time', 'time', 'not', 'complexities', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'Eric', 'Liddel', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'superb', 'performance', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'musical', 'score', 'Vangelis', 'incredibly', 'good', 'perfectly', 'theme', 'tone', 'fabulous', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'turn', 'fine', 'performances.The', 'film', 'slow', 'down', 'bit', 'certain', 'points', 'bit', 'extraneous', 'material', 'example', 'Abraham', 'romance', 'opera', 'singer', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'real', 'point', 'perhaps', 'further', 'Abrahams', 'successfully', 'managed', 'become', 'part', 'English', 'upper', 'class', 'Not', 'many', 'athletes', 'attend', 'opera', 'days', 'Overall', 'though', 'movie', 'along', 'reasonably', 'brisk', 'pace', 'numerous', 'leisurely', 'interludes', 'here', 'there', 'down', 'points', 'never', 'drags', 'viewer', 'interest', 'times.The', 'scene', 'Liddel', 'recovers', 'race', 'one', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'film', 'ever', 'perfectly', 'fact', 'that', 'Abraham', 'coach', 'Liddel', 'guts', 'draws', 'strength', 'Liddel', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'faith', 'God', 'film', 'depiction', 'American', 'Olympic', 'track', 'team', 'was', 'hilarious', 'thought', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'how', 'Americans', 'are', 'often', 'viewed', 'Brits', 'little', 'brash', 'unpolished', 'very', 'determined', 'competent', 'end', 'friends', 'scene', 'end', 'involving', 'Jackson', 'Schultz', 'quot', 'New', 'York', 'Thunderbolt', 'quot', 'Eric', 'Liddel', 'was', 'touching', 'done', 'just', 'right.I', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'noted', 'DVD', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'wide', 'letterbox', 'format', 'Perhaps', 're-release', 'something', 'can', 'look', 'forward', 'future', 'years', 'trust', 'film', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'available', 'DVD', 'truly', 'movie', 'afficianado', 'film', 'library.This', 'truly', 'great', 'movie', 'aged', 'beautifully', 'timeless', 'classic', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'very', 'favorite', 'films']",N/A

94952,A1CITRQE2HRW45,0790731010,"Scamp Lumm ""Littlesorrel/christian zionist""","[18, 18]","My absolute favorite scene in the movie was Eric Liddell's speech in a Cathedral on the sabbath when he should have been running in a qualifying heat for the 100 meters in the 1924 Olympics in Paris.  He read from Isaiah 40, the title for this review from verse 17.  He had refused to run on the sabbath because of his intense faith; he would be breaking one of the ten commandments if he did so but most importantly would not be consistent with what he had encouraged and taught others to do.  His decision was not made to draw attention to himself nor to draw attention to a religious idea he wanted to promote.  His motives were pure, based on principle.  He was born in China, both of his parents were missionaries there.  He also died in China in 1945 having been interned in a Japanese concentration camp working as a missionary; supposedly he had a tumor in his brain.  But that is not mentioned in the movie.  His rival in the 100 meters, Harold Abraham was a jew who went on to win the 100 meters for Great Britain.  The movie begins with a eulogy for Harold Abrahams by his friend, Cambridge classmate and Olympic team member, Lord Andrew Lindsay, at his funeral in 1978.  All flesh is grass, Isaiah says in this chapter, and so it is.When this movie came out in 1981, I was running track in high school, and this movie was all the rage amongst my classmates.  And it is still as inspirational as it was then.  Eric Liddell is clearly the standout in the crowd,  but for reasons other than his athletic skills.  His whole outlook is radically different from the other runners, and from what I've read about him elsewhere, he was known for his total ""absence of vanity"".  So, the movie is about his character and also that of his British teammates and their Olympic experience.  For the 1924 participants and particularly for Liddell, one's best efforts was purely for love of the Games, what a contrast to today's Olympics what with all the athletic endorsements, media hype, advertising, self-promotion.  All nations are before Him as nothing, no matter how large the parade of nations gets.  (Read Isaiah 40 to get the gist of what he's saying).Eric Liddell was also nicknamed ""the flying Scotsman"" after Scotland's most famous steamengine.  He had a unique way of running which Ian Charleson tries to replicate.  He was described as running with his arms waving through the air whereas Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) runs very precisely since he has consulted with knowledgeable coaches.  There are many contrasts between them, and rivalry, yet they both respect one another.  Much of the movie was filmed in Scotland at St. Andrew's University, near the site where St. Rule brought a few of St. Andrew's bones to Scotland from Greece.  If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll find this story of St. Andrew's.""Chariots of fire"" are mentioned in the bible in the book of 2 Kings 6:17 with regard to the prophet Elisha, not just in a poem by William Blake as I've read elsewhere.",5,All Nations Are Before Him as Nothing,1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,2994,"['absolute', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'speech', 'Cathedral', 'sabbath', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'running', 'qualifying', 'heat', '100', 'meters', '1924', 'Olympics', 'Paris', 'read', 'Isaiah', '40', 'title', 'review', 'verse', '17', 'had', 'refused', 'run', 'sabbath', 'intense', 'faith', 'would', 'be', 'breaking', 'one', 'ten', 'commandments', 'did', 'so', 'most', 'importantly', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'consistent', 'what', 'had', 'encouraged', 'taught', 'others', 'do', 'decision', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'draw', 'attention', 'draw', 'attention', 'religious', 'idea', 'wanted', 'promote', 'motives', 'were', 'pure', 'based', 'principle', 'was', 'born', 'China', 'parents', 'were', 'missionaries', 'there', 'also', 'died', 'China', '1945', 'having', 'been', 'interned', 'Japanese', 'concentration', 'camp', 'working', 'missionary', 'supposedly', 'had', 'tumor', 'brain', 'not', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'rival', '100', 'meters', 'Harold', 'Abraham', 'was', 'jew', 'who', 'went', 'win', '100', 'meters', 'Great', 'Britain', 'movie', 'eulogy', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'friend', 'Cambridge', 'classmate', 'Olympic', 'team', 'member', 'Lord', 'Andrew', 'Lindsay', 'funeral', '1978', 'flesh', 'grass', 'Isaiah', 'chapter', 'so', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '1981', 'was', 'running', 'track', 'high', 'school', 'movie', 'was', 'rage', 'amongst', 'classmates', 'still', 'as', 'inspirational', 'was', 'then', 'Eric', 'Liddell', 'clearly', 'standout', 'crowd', 'reasons', 'other', 'athletic', 'skills', 'whole', 'outlook', 'radically', 'different', 'other', 'runners', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'elsewhere', 'was', 'known', 'total', 'absence', 'vanity', 'So', 'movie', 'character', 'also', 'British', 'teammates', 'Olympic', 'experience', '1924', 'participants', 'particularly', 'Liddell', 'one', 'best', 'efforts', 'was', 'purely', 'love', 'Games', 'what', 'contrast', 'today', 'Olympics', 'what', 'athletic', 'endorsements', 'media', 'hype', 'advertising', 'self-promotion', 'nations', 'are', 'before', 'Him', 'nothing', 'matter', 'how', 'large', 'parade', 'nations', 'Read', 'Isaiah', '40', 'get', 'gist', 'what', 'saying', '.Eric', 'Liddell', 'was', 'also', 'nicknamed', 'flying', 'Scotsman', 'Scotland', 'most', 'famous', 'steamengine', 'had', 'unique', 'way', 'running', 'Ian', 'Charleson', 'replicate', 'was', 'described', 'running', 'arms', 'waving', 'air', 'whereas', 'Harold', 'Abrahams', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'very', 'precisely', 'consulted', 'knowledgeable', 'coaches', 'are', 'many', 'contrasts', 'rivalry', 'yet', 'respect', 'one', 'Much', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'Scotland', 'St.', 'Andrew', 'University', 'site', 'where', 'St.', 'Rule', 'brought', 'few', 'St.', 'Andrew', 'bones', 'Scotland', 'Greece', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'find', 'story', 'St', 'Andrew', 'Chariots', 'fire', 'are', 'mentioned', 'bible', 'book', '2', 'Kings', '6:17', 'regard', 'prophet', 'Elisha', 'not', 'just', 'poem', 'William', 'Blake', ""'ve"", 'read', 'elsewhere']",N/A

I have finally bought the first two, Chariots of Fire andGlory (Special Edition, Repackaged). The themes of both films are surprisingly related, although one takes place in the arena of amateur athletics and the other in the crucible of war.Chariots of Fire is a true story about two young men who both won gold medals in the 1924 Olympics. Ben Cross plays Harold Abrahams, a Jew attending Cambridge, with a fondness for Gilbert & Sullivan, a chip on his shoulder, and a determination to show the prejudiced upper crust of British society that he can ""run them off their feet."" Ian Charleson recreates Eric Liddell, the son of Scottish missionaries to China, who believes that God made him fast for a purpose, which he wants to fulfill before he returns to China. In spite of their surface differences, these men have much in common in their hearts. The actors were both making their maiden appearances in movies and what amazing performances they provide. Ben Cross went on to a long successful career. Ian Charleson was headed for massive success, but tragically became one of the early victims of AIDS. Don't miss this opportunity to see him here.Ian Holm, arguably one of Britain's best actors ever, plays a professional coach who helps Harold train for the Olympics and provides an emotional core to the film. There is a romance for Harold and a struggle with Eric's sister to show her why running is important to their mission. All the supporting cast is strong, perfect for their roles, and engrossing to watch.The movie won four Oscars including Best Picture.

When Chariots of Fire was read you could hear a little bit of a gasp from the audience and then much applause. I was rooting for this film gem to garner more attention because it was so unique.This movie tells the mostly true story about two different men seeking the same goals. To be the best at what they did. This film covers some of the events in the lives of a Scottish rugby player turned runner and a British sprinter in the time leading up to the 1924 Paris Olympics. The Americans were heavy favorites to win the most Gold medals in this Olympiad and indeed did win a majority of them. The mighty USA garnered 45 Golds and Great Britian won 9. But the story leading up to the winning of 2 of those British Gold medals was the basis of this movie.The photography, cinematography, and music were beautiful to watch and listen to during this film.

If I'm beginning to feel discouraged, I pop this movie in.  It's not my miracle cure, but it is an incredibly uplifting way to spend 2 hours!For those who don't know much about the plot, the other reviews posted will give you a fairly detailed run-down of who the characters are and what they are up to.  I'll merely say that the plot focuses on a true story from the 1924 Olympics.  There are 4 runners from Britain competing in the games - 2 with particularly bright hopes for a gold medal.  The only hitch is that these 2 have to compete against each other to get it.The movie starts in 1979 with the funeral of someone, but you don't know who it is.  Then the movie flashes back to the Olympics in 1924 and introduces your main narrator.  It then heads backwards even further to the point right before all these runners began competing.  What unfolds is a truly precious &amp; fully absorbing tale of these men in the 1920's in Britain, 3 at Cambridge and 1 in Scotland.  As the story progresses you see how the background &amp; faith of the men - particularly the 2 top runners - intertwines so heavily with their present reality as to affect every part of their life.  It affects their running, yes, but also their relationships, their inner battles &amp; their overall perception of the world around them.  One runs to prove something - to try to escape the suffocation he feels because he is Jewish.  (And, no, he's not a feminist.)  The other runs in complete freedom - a freedom is private and yet contageous.However, I don't want to prejudice anyone towards either runner.  It is simply too easy to love Liddell (the Scott) and to pity Abrahams (the Jew), at best.  I think Jewish groups have decidedly disliked this movie for that very reason.  But the movie gives you more content than that.  It allows you to reflect on their different childhoods, their different acceptance in the world, their different faith structures.And, finally, for anyone who is curious I tried to do a bit of research on Liddell to see what became of him.  The movie gives a brief synopsis of each, but Liddell's ending left me wanting to know more.  From what I found, Liddell did go back to China to do missions work.  He risked his life countless times to save Chinese men who the government had attacked and left for dead.  He was able to get his wife and kids safely to Canada before WWII, but he was sent to a prison camp.  There he organized Olympic type activities for the children &amp; wrote devotional materials for the adults.  He was a favorite among all who were there, and they were grieved when he died of a brain tumor shortly before the war ended.I'm not sure what adaptations were added to the movie from the Olympic story to make this more appealing.  However, I absolutely encourage anyone who seriously loves &amp; learns from movies to watch this one.  The stories of the tests &amp; triumphs of fellow humans - maintaining dignity in the face of so much - will strike your heart and leave you uplifted.",5,My Favorite Movie OF ALL TIME!,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,3115,"[""'m"", 'feeling', 'down', 'pop', 'movie', 'rainy', 'overcast', 'day', ""'ll"", 'pop', 'movie', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'feel', 'discouraged', 'pop', 'movie', 'not', 'miracle', 'cure', 'incredibly', 'uplifting', 'way', 'spend', '2', 'hours', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'plot', 'other', 'reviews', 'posted', 'will', 'give', 'fairly', 'detailed', 'run-down', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'are', 'up', ""'ll"", 'merely', 'say', 'plot', 'true', 'story', '1924', 'Olympics', 'are', '4', 'runners', 'Britain', 'competing', 'games', '2', 'particularly', 'bright', 'hopes', 'gold', 'medal', 'only', 'hitch', '2', 'have', 'compete', 'other', 'get', 'it.The', 'movie', '1979', 'funeral', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Then', 'movie', 'back', 'Olympics', '1924', 'introduces', 'main', 'narrator', 'then', 'backwards', 'even', 'further', 'point', 'right', 'runners', 'began', 'competing', 'What', 'truly', 'precious', 'amp', 'fully', 'absorbing', 'tale', 'men', '1920', 'Britain', '3', 'Cambridge', '1', 'Scotland', 'story', 'see', 'how', 'background', 'amp', 'faith', 'men', 'particularly', '2', 'top', 'runners', 'intertwines', 'heavily', 'present', 'reality', 'affect', 'part', 'life', 'running', 'yes', 'also', 'relationships', 'inner', 'battles', 'amp', 'overall', 'perception', 'world', 'One', 'prove', 'something', 'try', 'escape', 'suffocation', 'Jewish', 'not', 'feminist', 'other', 'runs', 'complete', 'freedom', 'freedom', 'private', 'yet', 'contageous.However', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'prejudice', 'anyone', 'runner', 'simply', 'too', 'easy', 'love', 'Liddell', 'Scott', 'pity', 'Abrahams', 'Jew', 'best', 'think', 'Jewish', 'groups', 'have', 'decidedly', 'disliked', 'movie', 'very', 'reason', 'movie', 'more', 'content', 'reflect', 'different', 'childhoods', 'different', 'acceptance', 'world', 'different', 'faith', 'structures.And', 'finally', 'anyone', 'who', 'curious', 'tried', 'do', 'bit', 'research', 'Liddell', 'see', 'what', 'became', 'movie', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'Liddell', 'ending', 'left', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'what', 'found', 'Liddell', 'did', 'go', 'back', 'China', 'do', 'missions', 'work', 'risked', 'life', 'countless', 'times', 'save', 'Chinese', 'men', 'who', 'government', 'had', 'attacked', 'left', 'dead', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'wife', 'kids', 'safely', 'Canada', 'WWII', 'was', 'sent', 'prison', 'camp', 'organized', 'Olympic', 'type', 'activities', 'children', 'amp', 'wrote', 'devotional', 'materials', 'adults', 'was', 'favorite', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'were', 'grieved', 'when', 'died', 'brain', 'tumor', 'shortly', 'war', 'ended.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'adaptations', 'were', 'added', 'movie', 'Olympic', 'story', 'make', 'more', 'appealing', 'However', 'absolutely', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', 'seriously', 'amp', 'movies', 'watch', 'one', 'stories', 'tests', 'amp', 'triumphs', 'fellow', 'humans', 'maintaining', 'dignity', 'face', 'so', 'much', 'will', 'strike', 'heart', 'leave', 'uplifted']",N/A

There really isn't much that happens that doesn't exude old fashion academic sportsman like excellence. The opening scene of the men running on the beach is something that could stay with you forever. This film is a time period piece that takes you back to Cambridge in the early 20th century. The film itself was made in 1981.  The cast includes a familar set of faces from the time period including: Ben Cross, Ian Charleson, Nicholas Farrell, Nigel Havers, and Ian Holm.  Everyone in the film is dapper and always formal. The story follows a team of Cambridge runners on there journey to the olympics. Two notable runners are Ben Cross as Harold Abrahams, a Jewish student at Cambridge University and Ian Charleson as Eric Liddell, the son of Scottish missionaries to China. Eric Liddell runs for the glory of God and Harold Abrams runs to overcome racism.  The Olympic race scenes are truly great and really draw the viewer in.

The film depicts the true life journey of two sprint champions from the 1924 Paris Olympics.  This isn't your average sports movie as the character development is more significant than the competition on the track.  The ""Flying Scotsman"" Eric Liddell is man of deep moral conviction and joyful heartfelt devotion to God.  As he runs he senses God's pleasure.  Harold Abrams is an intense Jewish student at Cambridge who is driven to win in defiance of the obstacles of prejudice and institutionalism.  He runs to prove his worth.The film is slow moving and filled with numerous flashbacks.  Knowing the history of the characters would enable you to better follow the story and appreciate the men portrayed.  The acting is excellent with terrific performances by supporting actors such as Ian Holm as track coach Sam Mussabini; John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson as the stuffy masters of the university; and Nigel Havers as the likeable Lord Lindsay.  The electronic sounding musical score is the most recognizable part of the movie and the costuming is exceptional.

94970,A1RGTGCP7UG4ZA,0790731010,Tony Marquise Jr.,"[0, 0]",This is the story of two British men who competed in the 1924 Olympic games as runners.  The shadow of World War I hangs over them(one of whom fought in the war)  and the world they live in.  This film immortalizes the struggle of Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell to win the gold in their respective races.  This is the best movie ever about those who 'play' in the Olympic games and one of the most entertaining modern movies.

94973,A1FT7QFKNHL9DT,0790731010,Wolfe Moffat,"[11, 12]","What a statement! I remember the first time I saw this I was maybe 5 years old, and the scene that stuck with me was when Eric Liddell got knocked down, got back up, and won the race early in the movie! Being a baseball and football fan, I still have no idea why that scene in particular stuck with me. But over 20 years later, I know why it will always be one of my favorites. The stubborn, yet amazing faith of 2 men, but with faith in 2 different things. The amazing thing is that ultimately, they both came out winners!I say that because I myself am like Harold Abrahams. You better believe that this man hates to lose! And he's seeking top prize, not for just 1 competition, but for everything he enters. 2nd place isn't good enough. Not even close to being good enough. The woman he's dating scolds him by telling him he's acting like a child after a close 2nd place finish, and he still can't accept it. And that's my kind of man! By the way, I love the Gilbert and Sullivan through parts of this, you can't go wrong with a classice duo such as Gilbert and Sullivan, amen?But then you have Scottish missionary, Eric Liddell. This is a man after God's own heart, and there are certain things that he will not compromise, it just isn't going to happen. He has it in him to stand up to people with the right amount of grace, yet with boldness! You won't find Eric Liddell back down. Also I find that I am at times in awe of how Liddell loves what he does, because he's doing it for his Lord. He knows God made him for China, but God also made him fast, and then he says something that everyone should pay attention to, ""And when I run, I can feel His pleasure!"" Hey, sometimes you can't help but go, ""GULP!"" as you try and choke back a tear or two.These guys are both faced with adversity, yet they both triumph! And they never gave in!",5,Feeling His pleasure!
