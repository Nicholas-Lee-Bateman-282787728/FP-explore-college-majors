Really cute episode with great new songs as the two teams race across the savannah to see who will end up with the elephant.The Magic SkateboardTyrone really wants to be a great skateboarder. He may not know all the tricks yet, but once he finds the magic skateboard, he's going to compete in the Show-Off Showdown.The FlipperUniqua, Tasha and Pablo are the Meteor Watch Squad. But when meteor-obsessed Pablo accidentally spills toxic space goo all over himself, he becomes the super strong, super excitable Flipper!Super Team AwesomeTyrone is a tour guide for the world's only lava geyser, Old Gushie. When a loose boulder in the cavern threatens to cause a geothermal disaster, Tyrone calls for help. Not one, but three superheroes come to save the day!It's nice to see the Backyardigans DVDs back on track after the last one was released short an episode and with a 30-minute tribute to the Fresh Beat Band.",5,Episode List,1278547200,"07 8, 2010",2010,1366,"['Here', 'episode', 'list', 'DVD', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'one', 'Amazon', 'so', 'anyone', 'else', 'wondering', 'what', 'Operation', 'Elephant', 'Drop', 'still', 'pre-order', 'here', 'Elephant', 'RunPark', 'Ranger', 'Tasha', 'very', 'important', 'job', 'delivery', 'agents', 'Tyrone', 'Pablo', 'who', 'never', 'fail', 'deliver', 'package', 'get', 'endangered', 'Indian', 'elephant', 'safely', 'Wildlife', 'Sanctuary', 'avoid', 'bad', 'guys', 'Uniqua', 'henchman', 'Austin', 'Really', 'cute', 'episode', 'great', 'new', 'songs', 'two', 'teams', 'race', 'savannah', 'see', 'who', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'elephant.The', 'Magic', 'SkateboardTyrone', 'really', 'be', 'great', 'skateboarder', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'tricks', 'yet', 'once', 'magic', 'skateboard', 'going', 'compete', 'Show-Off', 'Showdown.The', 'FlipperUniqua', 'Tasha', 'Pablo', 'are', 'Meteor', 'Watch', 'Squad', 'when', 'meteor-obsessed', 'Pablo', 'accidentally', 'toxic', 'space', 'goo', 'super', 'strong', 'super', 'excitable', 'Flipper', 'Super', 'Team', 'AwesomeTyrone', 'tour', 'guide', 'world', 'only', 'lava', 'geyser', 'Old', 'Gushie', 'When', 'loose', 'boulder', 'cavern', 'threatens', 'cause', 'geothermal', 'disaster', 'Tyrone', 'help', 'Not', 'one', 'three', 'superheroes', 'come', 'save', 'day', 'nice', 'see', 'Backyardigans', 'DVDs', 'back', 'track', 'last', 'one', 'was', 'released', 'short', 'episode', '30-minute', 'tribute', 'Fresh', 'Beat', 'Band']",The Backyardigans: Operation Elephant Drop

Since we watch these movies for road trips, I'm not in the back to watch it with them and I have really no idea what the difference is.Further edit: i should say that my children have a tendency to either completely love an episode or be utterly bored by it.
