818786,A24RG4UTQ5MY9G,B0001ZWLSS,culture lover,"[1, 1]","As a fan of Frank Capra, I had to see ""Here Comes the Groom,"" even though it's one of the postwar ones that everybody knocks.  So I was pleasantly surprised when -- but I'm getting ahead of myself.Paramount has an interesting pair of films here.  Made one year apart, both star Bing Crosby and Jane Wyman and both are 50's musicals.  Beyond that the difference is striking.  One's in color; the other isn't.  One is quite good, and the other . . .Let's start with ""Just for You.""  Bing plays a Broadway impresario who is personally and professionally attached to his leading lady, played by Jane Wyman.  The fly in the ointment is Bing's two teenaged children, who have been neglected by their widower father.  Bing tries to make up by spending more time with his son, who falls in love with Wyman.  (Are you laughing yet?)  The flawed conceit of the script requires an actress to be old enough that Bing isn't ""robbing the cradle,"" yet young enough to appeal to his 18 year old son.  Wyman may be lovely, but not enough to appeal to someone literally half her age.  (Side note: the actor playing Bing's son has such a baby face, that seeing him in suits makes him look like a little boy playing ""dress up."")  Natalie Wood, who plays Bing's daughter, was in-between the cuteness of ""Miracle on 34th St"" and the vivaciousness of ""Rebel Without a Cause.""  The biggest problem, however, is she is hardly given anything to do. Ethel Barrymore and Natalie's drunken governess do their best to keep things lively and there's a nice musical number, ""I'll Si-Si Ya in Bahia"" but overall, this one just WASN'T for me.Next is ""Here Comes the Groom.""  Made a year earlier and in black and white, ""Groom"" is far superior.  Much of the credit must go to director Frank Capra.  Watching this for the first time, I wondered why people didn't regard this as fondly as ""It Happened One Night"" or ""You Can't Take It With You.""  True, it's no ""Mr. Smith"" or ""It's a Wonderful Life"" but what is?Here Bing plays Pete, an overseas reporter who has become attached to two French orphans.  He needs someone to act as mother to little Bobbie and Suzi, just when his long-suffering fiancee, Emmadel Jones (Wyman) has given up on him and plans to marry her millionaire employer (Franchot Tone).  There is more drama in the first ten minutes (a scene with Anna Maria Alberghetti in a cameo role before Pete even decided to adopt the kids) than in the entirety of ""Just for You.""  There's also a funny and inventive ""talking record"" performance of Emmadel giving Pete a kiss off.Alexis Smith is wonderful as cold, repressed Cousin Winifred.  Capra's love for supporting characters is in evidence here, with much attention given to Robert Keith (Brian Keith's dad) as Pete's newspaper editor boss.  Nominally a throw-away role, Capra allows Keith the space to enliven his character in a way that warms the film.  To a lesser extent, Connie Gilchrist as Emmadel's mother is also permitted enough room to be a character and not just an obstacle in the script.Crosby is a delight from start to finish, especially in the ""makeover"" scene with Alexis and Robert Keith.  Wyman, who was reportedly looking for lighter fare after playing dark roles in ""Johnny Belinda"" and ""The Glass Menagerie,"" really throws herself into the role (in a good way).  Her singing and dancing number with Bing, ""In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening,"" is a treat.  The difference between her charm here and in ""Just For You"" is the difference between a milkshake and skim milk.So why isn't this regarded as warmly as ""It Happened One Night"" ?  Several reasons.  Capra was slowing down and it shows.  Some of the dialogue wasn't tweaked to the fine edge of his earlier works.  An over-reliance on old-fashioned vaudeville humor (especially Wyman's drunken Irish father).  Franchot Tone, who still has the charm to play a latter-day Prince Charming but the ravages of his real life alcohol problems can't be covered up.  Mostly, however, it's a third act that doesn't quite gel.  But the first two-thirds are delightful.Not a bad deal for the price.  If you like Crosby, Wyman or classic rom-coms, you owe it to yourself to see a near classic (""Groom"") paired with an also-ran.",4,"Crosby and Capra and Wyman, oh my !",1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,4219,"['fan', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'had', 'see', 'Here', 'Groom', 'even', 'one', 'postwar', 'ones', 'everybody', 'knocks', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'myself.Paramount', 'interesting', 'pair', 'films', 'here', 'Made', 'one', 'year', 'apart', 'star', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'are', '50', 'musicals', 'Beyond', 'difference', 'striking', 'One', 'color', 'other', ""n't"", 'One', 'quite', 'good', 'other', '.Let', 'start', 'Just', 'Bing', 'Broadway', 'impresario', 'who', 'personally', 'professionally', 'attached', 'leading', 'lady', 'played', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'fly', 'ointment', 'Bing', 'two', 'teenaged', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'neglected', 'widower', 'father', 'Bing', 'tries', 'make', 'up', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'son', 'who', 'love', 'Wyman', 'Are', 'laughing', 'yet', 'flawed', 'conceit', 'script', 'actress', 'be', 'old', 'enough', 'Bing', ""n't"", 'robbing', 'cradle', 'yet', 'young', 'enough', 'appeal', '18', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Wyman', 'may', 'be', 'lovely', 'not', 'enough', 'appeal', 'someone', 'literally', 'half', 'age', 'Side', 'note', 'actor', 'playing', 'Bing', 'son', 'baby', 'face', 'seeing', 'suits', 'look', 'little', 'boy', 'playing', 'dress', 'up', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'who', 'Bing', 'daughter', 'was', 'in-between', 'cuteness', 'Miracle', '34th', 'St', 'vivaciousness', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'biggest', 'problem', 'however', 'hardly', 'given', 'anything', 'do', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'Natalie', 'drunken', 'governess', 'do', 'best', 'keep', 'things', 'lively', 'nice', 'musical', 'number', ""'ll"", 'Si-Si', 'Ya', 'Bahia', 'overall', 'one', 'just', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'me.Next', 'Here', 'Groom', 'Made', 'year', 'earlier', 'black', 'white', 'Groom', 'far', 'superior', 'Much', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'director', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Watching', 'first', 'time', 'wondered', 'why', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'regard', 'as', 'fondly', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'True', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'what', 'Here', 'Bing', 'Pete', 'overseas', 'reporter', 'who', 'become', 'attached', 'two', 'French', 'orphans', 'someone', 'act', 'mother', 'little', 'Bobbie', 'Suzi', 'just', 'when', 'long-suffering', 'fiancee', 'Emmadel', 'Jones', 'Wyman', 'given', 'up', 'plans', 'marry', 'millionaire', 'employer', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'more', 'drama', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'scene', 'Anna', 'Maria', 'Alberghetti', 'cameo', 'role', 'Pete', 'even', 'decided', 'adopt', 'kids', 'entirety', 'Just', 'also', 'funny', 'inventive', 'talking', 'record', 'performance', 'Emmadel', 'giving', 'Pete', 'kiss', 'off.Alexis', 'Smith', 'wonderful', 'cold', 'repressed', 'Cousin', 'Winifred', 'Capra', 'love', 'supporting', 'characters', 'evidence', 'here', 'much', 'attention', 'given', 'Robert', 'Keith', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'dad', 'Pete', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'boss', 'Nominally', 'throw-away', 'role', 'Capra', 'Keith', 'space', 'enliven', 'character', 'way', 'film', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Connie', 'Gilchrist', 'Emmadel', 'mother', 'also', 'permitted', 'enough', 'room', 'be', 'character', 'not', 'just', 'obstacle', 'script.Crosby', 'delight', 'start', 'finish', 'especially', 'makeover', 'scene', 'Alexis', 'Robert', 'Keith', 'Wyman', 'who', 'was', 'reportedly', 'looking', 'lighter', 'fare', 'playing', 'dark', 'roles', 'Johnny', 'Belinda', 'Glass', 'Menagerie', 'really', 'role', 'good', 'way', 'singing', 'dancing', 'number', 'Bing', 'Cool', 'Cool', 'Cool', 'Evening', 'treat', 'difference', 'charm', 'here', 'Just', 'difference', 'milkshake', 'skim', 'milk.So', 'why', ""n't"", 'regarded', 'as', 'warmly', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'Several', 'reasons', 'Capra', 'was', 'slowing', 'down', 'dialogue', 'was', ""n't"", 'tweaked', 'fine', 'edge', 'earlier', 'works', 'over-reliance', 'old-fashioned', 'vaudeville', 'humor', 'especially', 'Wyman', 'drunken', 'Irish', 'father', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'who', 'still', 'charm', 'play', 'latter-day', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'ravages', 'real', 'life', 'alcohol', 'problems', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'covered', 'up', 'Mostly', 'however', 'third', 'act', ""n't"", 'quite', 'gel', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'are', 'bad', 'deal', 'price', 'like', 'Crosby', 'Wyman', 'classic', 'rom-coms', 'owe', 'yourself', 'see', 'near', 'classic', 'Groom', 'paired', 'also-ran']",Just for You / Here Comes the Groom
818787,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B0001ZWLSS,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[9, 14]","""HERE COMES THE GROOM""  (Paramount, 1951) (one star)When folks discuss the great films of Frank Capra, this film seldom seems to come up... and there's a reason!  This was a pretty terrible film, one of Bing Crosby's least charming outings, and certainly a low point for Capra.  The script is atrocious, the realization is shoddy and abrupt, and the film's end may make you feel a little queasy.  Here's the plot: Bing is a foreign correspondent, off in postwar Europe, writing heartwarming stories about French war orphans.  His editor wants something juicier, and his jilted American fiancee does, too.  So, Bing has to come back to the States with, naturally, a couple of toussle-haired raggamuffins in tow and a song in his heart.  Alas!  He is too late: his sweetie (played by a remarkably shrill Jane Wyman) has dumped him in favor of her millionaire boss, amiably portrayed by Franchot Tone.  In fact, it's Franchot Tone, easily outshining Crosby, who gives this ricketty film its one glimmer of class... A long scene between him and Bing, when they size each other up, is the single redeeming sequence... Everything else is rough, slipshod and frantic, including Capra's directorial work, particularly the editing.  Bing does his best to be cool and hip, but his schtick just isn't working this time around... Mostly it's the film's fault; this is an amazingly substandard production... It's worth skipping, even if you're a big Bing Crosby fan.""JUST FOR YOU""  (Paramount, 1952) (three stars)Der Bingle and Jane Wyman team up again for this glossy Technicolor spectacle, in which Broadway star Bing is torn between his duty to his children (who are alienated because of his workaholic tendencies) and his budding love life (which, unfortunately, involves Jane Wyman, who I find quite unappealing).  It's an okay film, very white picket fence-y and Eisenhower-ish... The musical numbers don't have any cohesion, but that's okay -- they're clearly just meant to be eye candy and pad the film out... (Cast notes: Bing's son, Gary, plays his petulant son, while a teenage Natalie Wood plays the daughter... and sparkles in many a scene...) Kind of a ho-hum, melodramatic plot, but it's an entertaining enough movie, with some choice moments of campy fun.
