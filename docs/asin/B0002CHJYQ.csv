830281,AOA7DLVR783CM,B0002CHJYQ,2 princesses mom,"[5, 6]","My 2 girls have every Barbie movie-they love them all, but this one is Mattels greatest one yet-they only got it last week and they have watched it day and night and now have become Erika and Annaliese-they glide through the house signing, dancing and acting out every scene from the movie-they even like the evil Preminger when he sings(I think Martin Short was great). The extra music disk in the DVD pack was a great idea too-the girls listen to it in the car and anywhere they can. The movie theme is more of a Broadway Musical format compared to the other Barbie movies. There is never a dull moment in this one-from the start of the movie it is fun and full of action, and innocent romance and it keeps you glued to the tube. The original story of Prince and the Pauper is not the same as this storyline, but this is an absolutely wonderful story. I would recommend it highly for girls ages 3 and up.

But when the Barbie people hit on making computer-animated films featuring their characters, they did it right, and they still do.Like the earlier ""Nutcracker,"" ""Rapunzel,"" and ""Swan Lake"" films, our daughters are introduced to the classic arts in a way they can understand; in this case, Mark Twain's classic tale of a very poor youngster with nothing but a remarkable resemblance to a member of the royal family who would like nothing better than to get away from the responsibilities of royalty for awhile.  While two of the other films featured music quite heavily, being based on ballet, this one is done in the classic Hollywood/Broadway musical style, and the songs are as first-rate as anything you would expect from a big-budget Disney film (as opposed to this film, which could superficially be seen as nothing but a direct-to-video merchandising tool).Martin Short is featured as the bad guy, and as always, he has fun chewing on the scenery and earning the scorn of every viewer.  My little girl loves Wolfie, the barking cat; Sarafina, the elegant feline; Princess Annalise; her pauper double; and Herve, the aging heavy horse.  Oh yeah, there's a young king in town for an arranged marriage designed to save Annalise's kingdom from impending bankruptcy, and even my 7-year-old would say he's okay too.As a daddy I'm more interested in watching other films, of course, but this review is on behalf of my own little princess, who received this for her birthday less than a week ago and has watched it three times.  I could nitpick about the production from an adult perspective, but that's not the point.  My point here is that the Barbie people continue to produce high-quality entertainment for children that's consistently head and shoulders above most such product these days, and I'll never have the slightest reservation in letting my little girl indulge.There are those who may quibble about the political correctness of Barbies, and that's fine, but a 7-year-old girl couldn't care less about such things and is perfectly happy to engage in the princess fantasies represented here.  In any event, this story is modern enough that one of the characters chooses to pursue her career before getting married, so even the naysayers have to chew on that one for awhile.

In this musical, Kelly Sharidan reprises her role of Barbie and does double duty as Pricess Anneliese and Erika, which is quite a challenge, whether it's live action or animation. You go, Kelly!

One thing that I especially love about these movies is that they take stories that aren't as well-known as some other fairy tales and bring them to an eager audience.In The Princess and the Pauper, Anneliese is a princess longing to see the world outside the castle walls before she is married to King Dominick of the neighboring kingdom.  She ventures out into the city with her tutor, Julian, and befriends a poor girl by the name of Erika who is her virtual twin.  When Anneliese is kidnapped by the evil Preminger, who wants to marry the princess himself, Erika is called on by Julian to impersonate the princess so that they can stall for time to unravel the truth.  This brings about lots of adventure and romance as King Dominick finds himself falling for Erika and Julian tries to rescue his best friend, the princess.  There are definitely strong, self-sufficient women in this Barbie movie as evidenced by the ending, when one of the girls decides she must follow her dreams before marrying her prince.I also love the animals...Anneliese's Seraphina and Erika's Wolfie (the cat who barks) have a little thing of their own going, and I thought that Midas, the puffy, swanky little mean poodle was hilarious.The singing is great, the animation is beautiful, as usual...this is just a first class movie.

I was a little skeptical when I heard it was a musical, but the songs are well done and have very positive messages.  Including the music cd with the movie was a wonderful bonus (nice that we didn't have to buy that separately!)The folks at Mattel are truly marketing geniuses when it comes to this whole Barbie movie thing they have going on.  Each year they release a new movie (and of course a plethora of Barbie merchandise related to it) and they seem to know their target audience.  The stories they have told are timeless classics but with a more up to date spin on them.  I love what they did with the Prince and the Pauper story...the princess and her look-a-like were genuinely good characters in strong female roles.  They wanted to do what was right for others and for themselves.  I also appreciated the parts played by the male lead characters (Julian & Dominick) because they were respectful of the females in the movie and also good role models in their own, but limited roles.The villain is played to perfection by Martin Short.  He is way over the top of course, but I would expect nothing less from Martin Short!  I don't know who voiced the other characters but they all did a good job and the singing was beautiful.I give this 5 stars because it is just right for the audience they have intended it for - perfect for little girls of any age.  If they would have had these movies around when I was a girl I would have gone crazy over them!

830303,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B0002CHJYQ,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[8, 10]","I was definitely surprised by Barbie's take on ""The Prince And The Pauper"" tale.  The title was conveniently changed to ""Princess"" so that our beloved heroine could tackle the role wholeheartedly.  Anyway, this is definitely the best of all of the Barbie movies out there.When I first popped this one into the DVD player for my daughter, I expected something similar to the other Barbie flicks:  great choreography, decent animation, bland story with a happy ending, and one modestly popular voice.  Well, Martin Short provided the modestly popular voice, the animation was pretty good, and, as usual, the choreography was brilliant.  However, the story was nowhere near bland.The story has been told time and again.  The princess, played by Barbie, wants to get away from her royal responsibilities and live life like a normal person.  The pauper, also played by Barbie in a great dual performance(ha, ha), on the other hand, struggles to get by and would do anything to get a shot at the easy life.  Well, the princess and the pauper swap places by way of the princess being captured in a maniacal scheme for Short's character to become king.  The pauper pretends to be the princess long enough to thwart Short's plans and to give time for the the princess' aid(played by a dashing Ken, also in a dual role) to figure out exactly what is going on.  From there, we are treated to some light humor, romance, truth and lies.  It all ends happily, as expected, but I won't give anymore details.Granted, this movie is definitely geared towards the kids and it is a great marketing tool for the Barbie toyline, but it is a fun film to watch.  I never got bored with it.  It kept my attention for the complete running time and I was amazed at how well the story was actually played out.Recommended to folks with little girls who love Barbie(obviously), but if you don't have children, you might want to stay away.  I like it and give it four stars, but those four stars are based on the comparison to the existing Barbie films, so don't let the rating fool you.

The storyline is very well-written, the songs are catchy, and the costumes are gorgeous.  However, it still bothers me that the girl who's supposed to be a pauper is wearing a very elegant gown, but that's another story.  The choreography was lovely to watch, especially when Erika and Anneliese were twirling in opposite directions from a bird's eye view, showing Anneliese in a pink dress with a blue cape in the back, and Erika in a blue dress with a pink design in the center.  It kind of showed visually how the two girls were similar yet different at the same time.The DVD I got came with a bonus CD containing the songs of the movie, and that made me very happy, since the songs do get better the second and third times you hear them.  The music is lovely, and there are also karaoke tracks on the DVD, but without hearing Barbie singing, the songs are EXTREMELY difficult for a person to sing on her own because the lyrics go by so quickly, and the words aren't highlighted individually like on some singalong tracks, so small children may want to avoid this feature unless they know the songs by heart.All-in-all, it's a very heartwarming movie and definitely the best so far, even though it's far more realistic than the fantasy themes of the previous three movies.",5,Very good for a direct-to-video movie,1097107200,"10 7, 2004",2004,1414,"['having', 'seen', 'first', 'three', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'was', 'hoping', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'money', 'spent', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'storyline', 'very', 'well-written', 'songs', 'are', 'catchy', 'costumes', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'However', 'still', 'girl', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'pauper', 'wearing', 'very', 'elegant', 'gown', 'story', 'choreography', 'was', 'lovely', 'watch', 'especially', 'when', 'Erika', 'Anneliese', 'were', 'twirling', 'opposite', 'directions', 'bird', 'eye', 'view', 'showing', 'Anneliese', 'pink', 'dress', 'blue', 'cape', 'back', 'Erika', 'blue', 'dress', 'pink', 'design', 'center', 'kind', 'showed', 'visually', 'how', 'two', 'girls', 'were', 'similar', 'yet', 'different', 'same', 'time.The', 'DVD', 'got', 'came', 'bonus', 'CD', 'containing', 'songs', 'movie', 'made', 'very', 'happy', 'songs', 'do', 'get', 'better', 'second', 'third', 'times', 'hear', 'music', 'lovely', 'are', 'also', 'karaoke', 'tracks', 'DVD', 'hearing', 'Barbie', 'singing', 'songs', 'are', 'EXTREMELY', 'difficult', 'person', 'sing', 'own', 'lyrics', 'go', 'so', 'quickly', 'words', 'are', ""n't"", 'highlighted', 'individually', 'singalong', 'tracks', 'so', 'small', 'children', 'may', 'want', 'avoid', 'feature', 'know', 'songs', 'heart.All-in-all', 'very', 'heartwarming', 'movie', 'definitely', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'even', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'fantasy', 'themes', 'previous', 'three', 'movies']",N/A

She loves to sing, and musicals lend themselves for repeated encores by my daughter who learns songs faster than I ever could.  If you have never watched a Barbie movie, I would recommend you give them a try, especially if you have a little girl in your home.  They are much better than what most people who have not watched them think they are.  The messages in the movies are positive, and the movies themselves are captivating and well made.

The folks at Mattel have truly outdone themselves again with this engaging musical/fantasy story based on ""The Prince and the Pauper"" story.Princess Anneliese wants nothing more than to be free of the constraints of being 'royal' while commoner Erika wishes to be free of her poverty and position as an indentured servant for the mean Madame Kamp.  Their wishes are granted when Preminger (voiced by Martin Short) kidnaps Princess Anneliese so that he can assert his influence on the queen and become king.  Erika steps in to take the princess' place so that Julian (Anneliese's tutor and secret admirer) can bide his time and find out who took Anneliese.  In the meantime, Erika (as Anneliese) meets the handsome King Dominic and they fall in love.The story is resolved in true G/PG Barbie/Disney style and our heroes and heroines live happily ever after. However, what makes this film a real treat is its catchy songs (my daughter has been singing ""I'm Just Like You"" non-stop since the day she first saw this movie), memorable characters and engaging plot. Add to this the beautiful CGI work that transports you into colorful and magical fairytale.Like its Barbie dvd predecessors, ""The Princess and the Pauper"" is a great addition to our family film library and I highly recommend it to young Barbie fans and their parents for its wholesomeness and entertainment value.

I knew I would be stuck watching it over and over because my little girl loves to watch things with her daddy.  We sat down before bedtime and popped it in the VCR, and I committed myself to being a good daddy and to spending some quality time with my little one.  The movie opened with a rip-roaring musical number, and the quality of the computer animation was very impressive.  Being a Mark Twain scholar (I did my thesis on Twain), I was expecting a goofy, silly movie adaptation of the story.  After all, Barbie is about as interesting to me as fly vomit.  However, what I found was a wonder.  The story was excellent, but the songs were the best part of the film.  The quality of the musical numbers rivals that of any Disney production.  The VHS tape came with a CD with all of the major songs on it.  My little girl sits and sings them to me and even asks her dad to join in on the ""boy parts"" of the song.  What struck me about the movie most was the excellent character development in this short film.  It was, I have to reluctantly admit, wonderful.  Princess Annaliese, Erika, King Dominick, Julian, and the two cats are wonderfully portrayed.  However, the stand out character is most definitely Preminger.  This is a top-notch villain because he dosen't fit the established mold.  He is prissy, vain, and feminine.  However, he is also sly, conniving, and cruel hearted.  His musical number ""How can I refuse?"" is among the best ""villain songs,"" I have ever heard...bar none.  There is also a great subplot involving the cats.  Even the minor characters stand out.
