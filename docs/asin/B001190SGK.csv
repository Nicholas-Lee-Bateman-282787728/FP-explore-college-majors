The great story of Marco Polo done in this international co production with a great cast, great locations (in Italy, Morocco and Inner Mongolia in China), great historical reconstruction of the era, great storytelling, faithfulness to the original material. The little known actor Kenneth Marshall stars as Marco Polo. Denholm Elliot is his father Niccolo. Anne Bancroft is his mother. John Gielgud has a cameo as the Doge of Venice. Burt Lancaster is Pope Gregory X. Despite its many virtues, this miniseries has become quite hard to find and it is not usually aired on TV on reruns.",5,Extraordinary,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,698,"['saw', '1982', 'miniseries', 'famous', 'medieval', 'Venetian', 'explorer', 'Far', 'East', 'teenager', 'loved', 'great', 'story', 'Marco', 'Polo', 'done', 'international', 'co', 'production', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'locations', 'Italy', 'Morocco', 'Inner', 'Mongolia', 'China', 'great', 'historical', 'reconstruction', 'era', 'great', 'storytelling', 'faithfulness', 'original', 'material', 'little', 'known', 'actor', 'Kenneth', 'Marshall', 'Marco', 'Polo', 'Denholm', 'Elliot', 'father', 'Niccolo', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'mother', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'cameo', 'Doge', 'Venice', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Pope', 'Gregory', 'X', 'many', 'virtues', 'become', 'quite', 'hard', 'find', 'not', 'usually', 'aired', 'TV', 'reruns']","Marco Polo (473 Minutes. 3-DVD Box & Ken Marshall, Denholm Elliott, Anne Bancroft, Burt Lancaster) (1982)"

I've recently been thinking about this.See, there are actually several plots in this movie, but they're all the same thing over and over again:  Marco manages to make friends, save the day, and see justice prevail simply by being honest.  Whether with the Pope, Kublai, those tax collectors in the south, etc.I watched this series as a very young child and it made a profound impression on me.  Specifically, it convinced me that people in power simply need to hear honesty.  That's all it takes.  Then they'll take you under their wing, give you rapid promotions, etc.Several decades later I can state with confidence that this is not the case in the world.  People in power don't want to hear honesty.  They'll either think you're foolish, punish you for it, or both.But where did I get such a loony idea?  This movie!

I was impressed with the reviews on this series and certainly a fan of European/Asian history and travel.The cast of characters and acting were all very well done--- bordering on exceptional--- I can't imagine watching any other rendition of Marco Polo from now on and not comparing each portrayal with these people.Marco in the movie, portrayed as the ultimate 'do-gooder', wins the hearts almost to a single man of just about everyone by movies end, from the servants to the ladies, to rice farmers, to the hard lined buddhist monks and of course being virtually adopted by the Great Khan himself......not to mention best-friending the Khans ailing son.  While at the same time, he practically demands the Great Khan show kindness, generosity and fraternity to almost every living thing that crosses his field of vision.The other characters are perhaps a bit more flawed (and therefore, more believable.)  Not that both actors didn't play his part well, both child and adult.  Marco appears to fall in love with women also faster than a lonely jackrabbit on viagra, and has his share of romances....although arguably meets his match and is outdone by the dozen-wived Mongols.  But who am I to judge?  Perhaps this was his real character, I never met him.One would have almost expected the wicked steparents after his mothers death, quarrelsome spoiled half siblings, a traitorous companion on his journey or some truly evil nemesis in the Khans court to eventually be vanquished.  But you get none of these age old plots.  At least, as far as I can tell you, without spoiling the movie!I like the fact that the writers and director of this movie didn't fall into the time-worn American film groove of portraying heroes battling grossly unfair villains apparently bent on destruction for its own sake, and usually meeting their 'just ends'.  There is conflict but mostly just a whole lot of humanity- people being people, doing both good and bad.  With the exception of course being Marco, who is virtually a living saint.  But then, I suppose to an extent, they had to stick to 'the script'- which was written from his point of view ;).The dvd rendition I got was rather dark, especially in the beginning scenes- and certainly the colors could not be described as splendid or breathtaking.  But, you get used to it and quickly forget.Its a very good movie, great acting and everyone who has watched it with me has stayed through attentively- not sure if its worth the hefty $29.00 price tag, but then again I have seen TV series DVD packs that have been sold for small fortunes.Also I noticed at the time there was only 1 copy left available anywhere- another reason why I snapped this up- and now I see there is once again 1 copy available.Probably a coincidence.........",4,A GOOD MOVIE,1249257600,"08 3, 2009",2009,2796,"['Well', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'impressed', 'reviews', 'series', 'certainly', 'fan', 'European/Asian', 'history', 'travel.The', 'cast', 'characters', 'acting', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'bordering', 'exceptional', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'watching', 'other', 'rendition', 'Marco', 'Polo', 'now', 'not', 'comparing', 'portrayal', 'people.Marco', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'ultimate', ""'do-gooder"", 'hearts', 'almost', 'single', 'man', 'just', 'everyone', 'movies', 'end', 'servants', 'ladies', 'rice', 'farmers', 'hard', 'lined', 'buddhist', 'monks', 'course', 'being', 'virtually', 'adopted', 'Great', 'Khan', 'not', 'mention', 'best-friending', 'Khans', 'ailing', 'son', 'same', 'time', 'practically', 'Great', 'Khan', 'show', 'kindness', 'generosity', 'fraternity', 'almost', 'living', 'thing', 'field', 'vision.The', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'more', 'flawed', 'therefore', 'more', 'believable', 'Not', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'part', 'well', 'child', 'adult', 'Marco', 'fall', 'love', 'women', 'also', 'faster', 'lonely', 'jackrabbit', 'viagra', 'share', 'romances', '.although', 'arguably', 'match', 'outdone', 'dozen-wived', 'Mongols', 'who', 'am', 'judge', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'real', 'character', 'never', 'met', 'him.One', 'would', 'have', 'almost', 'expected', 'wicked', 'steparents', 'mothers', 'death', 'quarrelsome', 'spoiled', 'half', 'siblings', 'traitorous', 'companion', 'journey', 'truly', 'evil', 'nemesis', 'Khans', 'court', 'eventually', 'be', 'vanquished', 'get', 'none', 'age', 'old', 'plots', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'spoiling', 'movie', 'like', 'fact', 'writers', 'director', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'time-worn', 'American', 'film', 'groove', 'portraying', 'heroes', 'battling', 'grossly', 'unfair', 'villains', 'apparently', 'bent', 'destruction', 'own', 'sake', 'usually', 'meeting', ""'just"", 'ends', 'conflict', 'mostly', 'just', 'whole', 'lot', 'humanity-', 'people', 'being', 'people', 'doing', 'good', 'bad', 'exception', 'course', 'being', 'Marco', 'who', 'virtually', 'living', 'saint', 'then', 'suppose', 'extent', 'had', 'stick', ""'the"", ""script'-"", 'was', 'written', 'point', 'view', '.The', 'dvd', 'rendition', 'got', 'was', 'rather', 'dark', 'especially', 'beginning', 'scenes-', 'certainly', 'colors', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'described', 'splendid', 'breathtaking', 'get', 'used', 'quickly', 'forget.Its', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'everyone', 'who', 'watched', 'stayed', 'attentively-', 'not', 'sure', 'worth', 'hefty', '29.00', 'price', 'tag', 'then', 'again', 'have', 'seen', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'have', 'been', 'sold', 'small', 'fortunes.Also', 'noticed', 'time', 'was', 'only', '1', 'copy', 'left', 'available', 'anywhere-', 'reason', 'why', 'snapped', 'up-', 'now', 'see', 'once', 'again', '1', 'copy', 'available.Probably', 'coincidence']","Marco Polo (473 Minutes. 3-DVD Box & Ken Marshall, Denholm Elliott, Anne Bancroft, Burt Lancaster) (1982)"
