This woman is perpetually mad at her husband who seems to be trying to make the best of everything even during the hard times but she doesn't care.  Then we're suppose to believe that a woman would actually crawl into her dryer!  She crawls into a life with a husband who is cheating on her and mad at her all the time (maybe if she had married him, he wouldn't have turned out that way but then with her attitude, I can see how he would have).

This was fun, funny, silly, and still had some serious moments that many people are facing--divorce, little money, bickering about the little things in life, wanting more ""stuff"" or the grass-is-greener-on-the-other-side feelings.It is a heartwarming movie, but not as predictable as most.  Again, around 85-90 minutes running time, so short enough to play without committing to a marathon of movie watching.  I did not recognize any of the actors in this, which makes it easier for me to watch sometimes because I'm not looking at the actor as much as the story.Like A Nanny for Christmas, this is very tame, but I would rate it PG only because very young kids might not enjoy it.  Also good for 8 years old and up, I'd say, but nothing too adult if there are young kids walking through the room--no profanity, no nudity, no politics, just a simple Christmas movie.  I'd say kind of a cross between It's a Wonderful Life and Cinderella.  Another fun movie for a slumber party for young preteens and teens.

I would even go so far as to say I loved it. I checked it out of the library, but have been tempted to purchase it for my own DVD collection. Not only is it completely clean and family-friendly, but it was very entertaining and fun to watch. I was pleasantly surprised to note that my 6- and 4-year-old daughters also enjoyed it, although I think they were mostly enthralled by the ""stuff"" (ie, the jewels, clothes, etc).I admit it was fun to see all the rich-person stuff, but what particularly appealed to me was the basic moral of this tale: Be grateful for and appreciate the things you have, while you have them. It was a good reminder for me to stop dwelling on the negative and wishing for the things I think I want, and instead spend my time being grateful for my husband, my children, and my many, many blessings.

One day, she runs into an ex-boyfriend, Nick, who's married, and (unfortunately) [wealthy], and in the art gallery business. She actually does visit Nick's place.  Another day, Paula is in her basement, and unexpectedly hears voices coming through her washer/dryer. She peeks inside, and winds up bumping her head, then is out cold. Suddenly, she has a dream where she wonders what it would be like if she was married to Nick, and was [wealthy]. She hears the voices again through the washer/dryer, and crawls her way through it like she's in a magic tunnel, into Nick's house, and discovers that she's his wife. She then discovers that Nick is selfish, ungrateful, and unfaithful. She also discovers that Gary has been hired by Nick to set up a Christmas display, then discovers that he's married to a woman named Janine. Paula asks Gary if he remembers their time together. Gary says he does, but that's now history. Paula is in a real bind, and wishes for her old life back.  Eventually, at the Christmas party, Gary visits, and presents Paula with a gift. Paula is overjoyed. She and Gary kiss, then the dream fades, and she's back into her basement, and  comes to, so the wish of having her old life back comes true. Her family is supporting her. They go upstairs, and have a nice Christmas with family and friends. Gary even surprises Paula with a new gold Christmas ornament.

For 11 months a year I have what I feel is fairly good taste in books, film and television, but for one month I throw that all aside an glut myself with holiday cheese ... Of the Hallmark movie variety. And admit I love every second of it.As the combined efforts of Hallmark, Liftetime, ION, etc. produce roughly 30 Christmas movies a seasons--I consider it a jobs program for former third-billed sitcom and drama stars; I mean, c'mon, Tori Spelling's kids gotta' eat!--using only about five pre-existing plots, there is definitely a formula to these cheaply-produced films. (We play an annual Christmas movie guessing game where one person says a real TV-movie title and the other has to guess the plot from that alone. After you see a handful of these types of films, you can get astoundingly good, very quickly.) One of my favorites are the christmas wish/alternate reality movies, of which HOLIDAY SWITCH is my all-time favorite.I mean, it's got a former BAYWATCH star crawling through her clothes DRYER (no, really) into an alternate life where she married the ""one that got away"" and leads a luxe upper-class existence, instead of her own, harried, cash-strapped reality. I mean, basically, it's almost a parody of itself already. And the films of this type that don't take themselves too seriously are always the most fun.Of course she learns the ""true meaning of Christmas"" and, one can only hope, also how to keep her lint trap cleaner in the future, but this movie really is a lot of fun and will certainly put you in the Christmas mood ... Which is the whole point. I'd also note it's a great introductory point for someone who isn't really all that keen on watching TV Christmas films.I will point out that, despite it's low price point, there's not much need to buy this DVD, as Lifetime will almost certainly air this movie many times during the Christmas season.",4,"Ooey Gooey, Cheesy Christmas Goodness",1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,1988,"['said', 'also', 'embarrassing', 'review', 'forChristmas', 'Do-Over', 'flat-out', 'LOVE', 'made-for-TV', 'Christmas', 'movies', '11', 'months', 'year', 'have', 'what', 'feel', 'fairly', 'good', 'taste', 'books', 'film', 'television', 'one', 'month', 'throw', 'aside', 'glut', 'holiday', 'cheese', 'Hallmark', 'movie', 'variety', 'admit', 'love', 'second', 'it.As', 'combined', 'efforts', 'Hallmark', 'Liftetime', 'ION', 'etc', 'produce', 'roughly', '30', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'seasons', 'consider', 'jobs', 'program', 'former', 'third-billed', 'sitcom', 'drama', 'stars', 'mean', ""c'mon"", 'Tori', 'Spelling', 'kids', 'got', 'ta', 'eat', 'using', 'only', 'about', 'five', 'pre-existing', 'plots', 'definitely', 'formula', 'cheaply-produced', 'films', 'play', 'annual', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'guessing', 'game', 'where', 'one', 'person', 'real', 'TV-movie', 'title', 'other', 'guess', 'plot', 'alone', 'see', 'handful', 'types', 'films', 'can', 'get', 'astoundingly', 'good', 'very', 'quickly', 'One', 'favorites', 'are', 'christmas', 'wish/alternate', 'reality', 'movies', 'HOLIDAY', 'SWITCH', 'all-time', 'favorite.I', 'mean', 'got', 'former', 'BAYWATCH', 'star', 'crawling', 'clothes', 'DRYER', 'really', 'alternate', 'life', 'where', 'married', 'one', 'got', 'away', 'luxe', 'upper-class', 'existence', 'instead', 'own', 'harried', 'cash-strapped', 'reality', 'mean', 'basically', 'almost', 'parody', 'already', 'films', 'type', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'are', 'always', 'most', 'fun.Of', 'course', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'also', 'how', 'keep', 'lint', 'trap', 'cleaner', 'future', 'movie', 'really', 'lot', 'fun', 'will', 'certainly', 'put', 'Christmas', 'mood', 'whole', 'point', ""'d"", 'also', 'note', 'great', 'introductory', 'point', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'keen', 'watching', 'TV', 'Christmas', 'films.I', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'low', 'price', 'point', 'not', 'much', 'need', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Lifetime', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'air', 'movie', 'many', 'times', 'Christmas', 'season']",N/A

In a nutshell the main character is unhappy with her ordinary wife/mother life. She is married with two daughters and they are struggling to make ends meet but her husband does what he can to provide for her and the girls. She runs into an old flame who is still  handsome and perfect and now rich and successful. He invites her to his gallery opening and after spending a little time with him wonders if she chose the right man to marry and life to live. Long story short she is in the basement doing chores ends up bumping her head and gets a chance to take a glimpse on the greener side so to speak. In this life she chooses the artsy fartsy rich guy who showers her with any and everthing but she is miserable and their marriage is falling apart. So she realizes that her life with her family may have been tough but she was loved and not lonely.
