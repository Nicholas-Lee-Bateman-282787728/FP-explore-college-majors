Black plays a rock'n'roller who gets a job subbing for the country's top grammer school by pretending he's Ned Shneeebly (sic).  He takes over the class and teaches them the ABCs of Rock.  The talented kids are all great as they learn the lesson well of how to stick it to the man.And behind all the humor there's a serious message.  Rock'n'Roll explodes at a time of societal rightwing oppression.  Rock has been the way for half a century, the way to tell the man to ""step off"".  Whether ""the man"" is oppressive parents, teachers, or other disciplinarians who rule our oppressive society.  But there are some cracks in that oppression and that's where rock comes in.

Everyone tells him that he should take life more seriously and get a real job. So he does--as his friend! He applies for a job at a private prep school for young kids and instead of teaching them the basic subjects most schools teach he engulfs them in a pure rock music frenzy! He unleashes the inner Freddie Mercury and Tina Turner in all of the boys and girls in the classroom.Throughtout the movie he gives each of them roles in the band and some of the members even learn self-confidence and to get along better with their fellow classmates.

You're going to have to talk to the kids after the film to make sure they don't rebel against you.  Sure, it has plenty of good messages and humor mixed in there, but it doesn't hold down the subversive spirit of rock, which is envigorating.  Certainly the film is humorous and inspirational, but the plotline makes it sound like self-absorbed loafer dupes people into doing something that he couldn't have done himself and is forgiven. In other words, there's such a levity to serious subject matter like this that some people don't even realize how wrong Dewey's motives are. I have to give Jack Black and Richard Linklater credit because I don't think that anyone else could have pulled it off.  As for the DVD, it's excellent.  It captures the adult perspective of Black in the making of featurette, commentary, MTV's Diary of Jack Black. It also captures the kids who are broad draw for the film in the featurette, Toronto Film Festival Diary, commentary, and a portion of Jack Black's diary contains footage of them rehearsing songs for the soundtrack.  This DVD captures all the perspectives that you would like to see as a filmgoer who loves the film, like me.  Mike White, thank you for writing this for lovers of Black and Rock.

Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[0, 1]","'School Of Rock' is a very funny comedy starring the ever crazed antics of Jack Black.And even though he style varies little from movie to movie theres an odd likability about him.Sure he's manic and opinionated in the classic Belushi/Farley tradition but just as endearing.In this movie Jack portrays Dewey Finn,a failed guitarist with little more then big dreams of being a rock star.Through a turn of events he ends up masquerading as his best friend as a substitute teacher at a private school,forced to deal with a group of overachieving but slightly disfunctional pupils.He rounds on the one talent he has-music and ralleys the kids into forming a rock band.Many of the children have alot of talent and in the doing both Dewey and his students learn important lessons about inspiration and commitment.Everything almost comes down for Dewey when his fraud is revealed but not before the premier of his band,the School Of Rock and a song his young guitarist had written for a performance at a battle of the bands,designed orginally for Dewey to rebuild his career.Even though his old band (without him) wins everyone learns important lessons and Dewey and his young charges find a place for themselfs in the world.'School Of Rock' is a very entertaining comedy,not only because of Black but his students in the movie,all of whom are real musical prodigys.Also the movie has an important point to make about commitment and not letting go of your dreams.Black's character Dewey Finn embodies some rock clishes-an overwhelmingpersonality,a need too be very loud and a bit of an ego.But he actually emmerges as an encourging and empowering presence for his students.Some of them are shyly talented and it takes the unflappable personality of Dewey to bring them around.One unusual thing is how much the character detests the concept of sex,drugs and rock n' roll-it's all about the music to him 100%,even if it is implied he's been on the other side.I actually got alot out of this movie-Jack Black and his students provide alot of hilerious moments,as does supporting actress Joan Cussack.But I was also very entertained and felt even uplifted at the end.Maybe you will too!",5,We Pledge Alliegence To The Band!!!,1116374400,"05 18, 2005",2005,2175,"[""'School"", 'Rock', 'very', 'funny', 'comedy', 'starring', 'ever', 'crazed', 'antics', 'Jack', 'Black.And', 'even', 'style', 'little', 'movie', 'movie', 'theres', 'odd', 'likability', 'him.Sure', 'manic', 'opinionated', 'classic', 'Belushi/Farley', 'tradition', 'just', 'endearing.In', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'failed', 'guitarist', 'little', 'more', 'then', 'big', 'dreams', 'being', 'rock', 'turn', 'events', 'up', 'masquerading', 'best', 'friend', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'private', 'school', 'forced', 'deal', 'group', 'overachieving', 'slightly', 'disfunctional', 'pupils.He', 'rounds', 'one', 'talent', 'has-music', 'ralleys', 'kids', 'forming', 'rock', 'band.Many', 'children', 'have', 'alot', 'talent', 'doing', 'Dewey', 'students', 'learn', 'important', 'lessons', 'inspiration', 'commitment.Everything', 'almost', 'down', 'Dewey', 'when', 'fraud', 'revealed', 'not', 'premier', 'band', 'School', 'Rock', 'song', 'young', 'guitarist', 'had', 'written', 'performance', 'battle', 'bands', 'designed', 'orginally', 'Dewey', 'rebuild', 'career.Even', 'old', 'band', 'everyone', 'important', 'lessons', 'Dewey', 'young', 'charges', 'find', 'place', 'themselfs', 'world', ""'School"", 'Rock', 'very', 'entertaining', 'comedy', 'not', 'only', 'Black', 'students', 'movie', 'whom', 'are', 'real', 'musical', 'prodigys.Also', 'movie', 'important', 'point', 'make', 'commitment', 'not', 'letting', 'go', 'dreams.Black', 'character', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'rock', 'clishes-an', 'overwhelmingpersonality', 'need', 'too', 'be', 'very', 'loud', 'bit', 'ego.But', 'actually', 'encourging', 'empowering', 'presence', 'students.Some', 'are', 'shyly', 'talented', 'unflappable', 'personality', 'Dewey', 'bring', 'around.One', 'unusual', 'thing', 'how', 'much', 'character', 'concept', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'n', 'roll-it', 'music', '100', '%', 'even', 'implied', 'been', 'other', 'side.I', 'actually', 'got', 'alot', 'movie-Jack', 'Black', 'students', 'provide', 'alot', 'hilerious', 'moments', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Joan', 'Cussack.But', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'entertained', 'felt', 'even', 'uplifted', 'end.Maybe', 'will', 'too']",School of Rock
795578,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00018U9FW,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","There was a lot of hype surrounding `School of Rock' by the time I finally got around to watching it; hype that I'm not sure I really understand.  Sure, parts of this film are funny, but it's never so funny that I can't hold back the laughter.  In fact, for every critic and fan alike who scream this as being one of Black's greatest film roles (there was even talk back when this was released of his performance being `Oscar' worthy) I'm left a little confused because to me he's done much better than this.  Black does have his moments, but it's never enough to really convince me that he's award worthy.  To me it's nothing more than an amiably funny performance.The film follows Dewey Finn, played by Black, a down on his luck guitar player who never stopped following his dream even though it left him broke, friendless and pretty much considered a loser by his peers.  Being behind on his rent and jobless (recently being booted from his band) Dewey steals the identity of his roommate and takes on a sub-teaching job at a local elementary school.  Dewey of course has no idea what to do with these children, that is until he finds out that they are all insanely talented musicians.  Wanting to compete in `The Battle of the Bands' he decides to form a band within his classroom disguising the idea as a school project for next quarter that they are getting a leg up on.The plot of course follows the same formula of `dork uses people, everything goes great, dork is exposed, dork learns lesson, everything is great' that most comedies of this persuasion find themselves pigeonholed into, but it's still fun.  The musical numbers are by far the more entertaining scenes in the film, especially at the end when they perform at `The Battle of the Bands'.Some have mentioned that Black steals the show, but I strongly disagree.  To me it's Joan Cusack, the school principle, who steals every frame.  Cusack is probably my all time favorite supporting actress.  She makes even the unwatchable films worth the time.  Here, as the uptight principle she is just completely on mark the whole time.  She's quick witted, funny and intelligent, a brilliant actress.  Sarah Silverman also adds some character as the only real villain in the film, playing Dewey's roommates battleaxe of a girlfriend.  She's funny in that irritating yelling `want to sock her in the mouth' kind of way, which I didn't expect from her.All in all this is not a bad film, it is funny, but it lacks originality, and to me Black is just not that wonderful.  He serves his purpose (that of playing the dim witted idiot who learns a life lesson as well as teaches one) but any other comedian could have pulled this off, maybe even better.  Black is no Ferrell or Carrey, but he does succeed in making the general public laugh, most of the time, and here is one of his more polished roles (as in not much gross humor or unnecessary crudeness) so it should appeal to most in the family.  I may not completely agree with the praise heaped upon this film, but I can't argue with the fact that it did make me laugh and didn't leave me sour.",3,"Not the best comedy in the world, but decent enough to enjoy...",1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,3104,"['was', 'lot', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'School', 'Rock', 'time', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'understand', 'Sure', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'funny', 'never', 'so', 'funny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'laughter', 'fact', 'critic', 'fan', 'alike', 'who', 'scream', 'being', 'one', 'Black', 'greatest', 'film', 'roles', 'was', 'even', 'talk', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'performance', 'being', 'Oscar', 'worthy', ""'m"", 'left', 'little', 'confused', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'Black', 'have', 'moments', 'never', 'enough', 'really', 'convince', 'award', 'worthy', 'nothing', 'more', 'amiably', 'funny', 'performance.The', 'film', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'played', 'Black', 'down', 'luck', 'guitar', 'player', 'who', 'never', 'stopped', 'following', 'dream', 'even', 'left', 'broke', 'friendless', 'pretty', 'much', 'considered', 'loser', 'peers', 'Being', 'rent', 'jobless', 'recently', 'being', 'booted', 'band', 'Dewey', 'identity', 'roommate', 'sub-teaching', 'job', 'local', 'elementary', 'school', 'Dewey', 'course', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'children', 'out', 'are', 'insanely', 'talented', 'musicians', 'Wanting', 'compete', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'form', 'band', 'classroom', 'disguising', 'idea', 'school', 'project', 'next', 'quarter', 'are', 'getting', 'leg', 'up', 'on.The', 'plot', 'course', 'same', 'formula', 'dork', 'people', 'everything', 'great', 'dork', 'exposed', 'dork', 'learns', 'lesson', 'everything', 'great', 'most', 'comedies', 'persuasion', 'find', 'pigeonholed', 'still', 'fun', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'film', 'especially', 'end', 'when', 'perform', 'Battle', ""Bands'.Some"", 'have', 'mentioned', 'Black', 'show', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'school', 'principle', 'who', 'frame', 'Cusack', 'probably', 'time', 'favorite', 'supporting', 'actress', 'even', 'unwatchable', 'films', 'time', 'Here', 'uptight', 'principle', 'just', 'completely', 'mark', 'whole', 'time', 'quick', 'witted', 'funny', 'intelligent', 'brilliant', 'actress', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'also', 'character', 'only', 'real', 'villain', 'film', 'playing', 'Dewey', 'roommates', 'girlfriend', 'funny', 'irritating', 'yelling', 'want', 'sock', 'mouth', 'kind', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'her.All', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'funny', 'originality', 'Black', 'just', 'not', 'wonderful', 'purpose', 'playing', 'dim', 'witted', 'idiot', 'who', 'life', 'lesson', 'as', 'well', 'teaches', 'one', 'other', 'comedian', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'maybe', 'even', 'better', 'Black', 'Ferrell', 'Carrey', 'succeed', 'making', 'general', 'public', 'laugh', 'most', 'time', 'here', 'one', 'more', 'polished', 'roles', 'not', 'much', 'gross', 'humor', 'unnecessary', 'crudeness', 'should', 'appeal', 'most', 'family', 'may', 'not', 'completely', 'agree', 'praise', 'heaped', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'fact', 'did', 'make', 'laugh', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'sour']",School of Rock

795580,A2K3L0DOPQQ697,B00018U9FW,"Andrew Olson ""otaku""","[2, 5]","Oh, how to best convey the majesty that is Richard Linklater's 'School of Rock', starring Jack Black and Joan Cusack? Maybe I could say it rocked? Nah, too obvious. Maybe I could talk about the music? Nah, anyone can see what the soundtrack was just by looking at the relevant IMDb page. Maybe I should say how guilty yet excited I feel to have enjoyed this movie far more than all the arthouse stuff and Oscar-bait I've seen this year - but that makes the film seem like a guilty pleasure, and there's nothing wrong with holding your head up high and saying you love Linklater, Black, Cusack, writer Mike White and co-star Sarah Silverman.Or maybe - just maybe - I could say that when I got in last night, I still felt charmed and elated and deliriously happy by the spell that this movie - this silly, sentimental little commercial movie - had cast on me. This is a feel-good movie where the feel-good ending is actually the best part, rather than a syrupy, predictable letdown. The characters have damn well earned that happy ending, and you want them to get it so badly, even as Linklater adds enough grace notes of harsh reality to let you know that our heroes may not succeed. And he sells you on this, too.Up until recently, the playfully philosophical Linklater's most mainstream movie was his glorious 70s ensemble comedy 'Dazed & Confused' (1993). Dewey Finn, the central character in this movie, played by Jack Black as an even goofier extension of Jack Black, feels like one of the kids from that movie all grown up - or rather, not grown up. Dewey still believes in the power of rock to change lives, to change the world, even - but The Man has ground his spirit down. Many reviews note how Mike White's script doesn't really seem to believe in the power of rock as much as Dewey does, and it's true that 'School of Rock' is hardly an underground missive from the scene like, say, Alex Cox's rock films are. But that's intentional. Dewey is adrift without a 'scene' to back him up, and he slowly has to accept that no, there's nothing he can do about the fact that The Man rules the world. All he can do is build his little corner of it.And build it he does. Dewey's audacious plan is to pose as a substitute teacher and use the kids under his tutelage to form the most rocking band who ever were - The School Of Rock - and blow his old band off the stage at the Battle of the Bands. What's good about the kids is a microcosm of what's good about the film - the audience never laughs at them, always with them, and their appreciation of music is sincere and unaffected. The kids are non-actors (like the kids in Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund's 'City of God') chosen for their musical ability, and it's a joy seeing their fingers dance dexterously around a panoply of instruments. They rock, too - so many movies about music are brought down by the unremarkable nature of their fictional bands, but if School Of Rock were a real band, man, I'd buy their CD in a heartbeat.The other good quality shared by the kids and the movie is this; they both know their stuff, and while adhering to the structure of a formula comedy, enough esoterica and clever parodies are thrown in to tickle even the most [...] of rock lovers. The references can get as obscurely hilarious as the countless operas, wines and psychology in-jokes in 'Frasier': it just deals in a different area. So we get Dewey waxing lyrical about the keyboard solos on Yes songs, film clips of Angus Young and Keith Moon are shown without spelling out who they are for the audience, and the winning band at the climatic Battle sound hilariously akin to inexplicably popular post-grunge whingers Staind.'School of Rock' captures the giddy excitement of being young and cocky and creative like no film I've ever seen; it features the best performance to date from Jack Black, a whirling, borderline-psychotic, hilariously hammy tornado ripping through the film; it allows the frequently underused Joan Cusack to be funny and even sexy within the confines of an 'authority' role; it is the best film about rock and roll since 'This Is Spinal Tap' and it succeeds in transporting Linklater's style, imagination and vital humanity into the mainstream without compromise in a way that, say, the Coen brothers have yet to do. Everyone involved should give themselves a pat on the back, or better yet, a big, sweaty, post-gig group hug.",5,oddly entertaining in the only Jack Black way,1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,4403,"['Oh', 'how', 'best', 'convey', 'majesty', 'Richard', 'Linklater', ""'School"", 'Rock', 'starring', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Maybe', 'could', 'say', 'rocked', 'Nah', 'too', 'obvious', 'Maybe', 'could', 'talk', 'music', 'Nah', 'anyone', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'just', 'looking', 'relevant', 'IMDb', 'page', 'Maybe', 'should', 'say', 'how', 'guilty', 'yet', 'excited', 'feel', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'arthouse', 'stuff', 'Oscar-bait', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'film', 'seem', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'holding', 'head', 'up', 'high', 'saying', 'love', 'Linklater', 'Black', 'Cusack', 'writer', 'Mike', 'White', 'co-star', 'Sarah', 'Silverman.Or', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'could', 'say', 'when', 'got', 'last', 'night', 'still', 'felt', 'charmed', 'elated', 'deliriously', 'happy', 'spell', 'movie', 'silly', 'sentimental', 'little', 'commercial', 'movie', 'had', 'cast', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'where', 'feel-good', 'ending', 'actually', 'best', 'part', 'rather', 'syrupy', 'predictable', 'letdown', 'characters', 'have', 'damn', 'well', 'earned', 'happy', 'ending', 'want', 'get', 'so', 'badly', 'even', 'Linklater', 'enough', 'grace', 'notes', 'harsh', 'reality', 'let', 'know', 'heroes', 'may', 'not', 'succeed', 'too.Up', 'recently', 'playfully', 'philosophical', 'Linklater', 'most', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'was', 'glorious', '70s', 'ensemble', 'comedy', ""'Dazed"", 'Confused', '1993', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'central', 'character', 'movie', 'played', 'Jack', 'Black', 'even', 'goofier', 'extension', 'Jack', 'Black', 'feels', 'one', 'kids', 'movie', 'grown', 'up', 'rather', 'not', 'grown', 'up', 'Dewey', 'still', 'power', 'rock', 'change', 'lives', 'change', 'world', 'even', 'Man', 'ground', 'spirit', 'down', 'Many', 'reviews', 'note', 'how', 'Mike', 'White', 'script', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'believe', 'power', 'rock', 'as', 'much', 'Dewey', 'true', ""'School"", 'Rock', 'hardly', 'underground', 'missive', 'scene', 'say', 'Alex', 'Cox', 'rock', 'films', 'are', 'intentional', 'Dewey', 'adrift', ""'scene"", 'back', 'up', 'slowly', 'accept', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'fact', 'Man', 'rules', 'world', 'can', 'do', 'build', 'little', 'corner', 'it.And', 'build', 'Dewey', 'audacious', 'plan', 'pose', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'use', 'kids', 'tutelage', 'form', 'most', 'rocking', 'band', 'who', 'ever', 'were', 'School', 'Rock', 'blow', 'old', 'band', 'stage', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'What', 'good', 'kids', 'microcosm', 'what', 'good', 'film', 'audience', 'never', 'always', 'appreciation', 'music', 'sincere', 'unaffected', 'kids', 'are', 'non-actors', 'kids', 'Fernando', 'Meirelles', 'Katia', 'Lund', ""'City"", 'God', 'chosen', 'musical', 'ability', 'joy', 'seeing', 'fingers', 'dance', 'dexterously', 'panoply', 'instruments', 'rock', 'too', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'music', 'are', 'brought', 'down', 'unremarkable', 'nature', 'fictional', 'bands', 'School', 'Rock', 'were', 'real', 'band', 'man', ""'d"", 'buy', 'CD', 'heartbeat.The', 'other', 'good', 'quality', 'shared', 'kids', 'movie', 'know', 'stuff', 'adhering', 'structure', 'formula', 'comedy', 'enough', 'esoterica', 'clever', 'parodies', 'are', 'thrown', 'tickle', 'even', 'most', '[', ']', 'rock', 'lovers', 'references', 'can', 'get', 'obscurely', 'hilarious', 'countless', 'operas', 'wines', 'psychology', 'in-jokes', ""'Frasier"", 'just', 'deals', 'different', 'area', 'get', 'Dewey', 'waxing', 'lyrical', 'keyboard', 'solos', 'Yes', 'songs', 'film', 'clips', 'Angus', 'Young', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'are', 'shown', 'spelling', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'audience', 'winning', 'band', 'climatic', 'Battle', 'sound', 'hilariously', 'akin', 'inexplicably', 'popular', 'post-grunge', 'whingers', 'Staind', ""'School"", 'Rock', 'giddy', 'excitement', 'being', 'young', 'cocky', 'creative', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'Jack', 'Black', 'whirling', 'borderline-psychotic', 'hilariously', 'hammy', 'tornado', 'ripping', 'film', 'frequently', 'underused', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'be', 'funny', 'even', 'sexy', 'confines', ""'authority"", 'role', 'best', 'film', 'rock', 'roll', ""'This"", 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'transporting', 'Linklater', 'style', 'imagination', 'vital', 'humanity', 'mainstream', 'compromise', 'way', 'say', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'have', 'yet', 'do', 'Everyone', 'involved', 'should', 'give', 'pat', 'back', 'better', 'yet', 'big', 'sweaty', 'post-gig', 'group', 'hug']",School of Rock

If Chris Farley were alive today,he would have been perfect for the character of Dewey Finn,portrayed by Black. Farley played characters like Dewey,semi-obnoxious but kind. The film was written by Mike White who plays Dewey's buddy and roommate Ned Schneeblee. The most famous of all is Joan Cusack who is Rosalie Mullins,the principal of Horace Green Elementary School. Dewey,a heavy metal band's frontman is fired from the band and worse,is threatened with eviction from his apartment that he shares with Ned and Ned's girlfriend. To pay back rent,Dewey,who had shaved off his beard,takes a teaching position at an elementary school where Ned teaches also. After Dewey arrives,using his buddy's name,the classroom is definitely not the same! The kids in the class aren't learning math and English much anymore. Dewey teaches each kid how to play the guitar and keyboard. Before too long,loud,hard rock is emerging from the classroom. This is brought to the prncipal's attention after receiving a complaint from another faculty member. Dewey and the kids hide all the evidence before the principal enters the classroom. After Ned receives some kind of notice in the mail regarding something that he really wasn't involved in,he takes action,with the help of his girlfriend,by sending the police to the school during a PTA meeting,which there are many infuriated parents. Here's where Dewey discloses his real identity. He did the wrong thing for the right reason. But,now all the kids are talented musicians in their own right and are performing in a talent show with Dewey as the School Of Rock. The principal and the angry parents arrive at the performance way too late. There's also one scene where Dewey and the principal go on a date.

795583,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00018U9FW,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","&quot;School of Rock&quot; was written by the increasingly prolific screenwriter and actor Mike White.  Here, White shows that such eye-openingly good works like &quot;The Good Girl&quot; (with Jennifer Aniston) and the critically acclaimed &quot;Chuck and Buck&quot; were no flukes.  For the first time since &quot;High Fidelity,&quot; Black is given material that suits him.  Credit White for writing and building a movie around Black's talents.  And if you think that sounds easy, go talk to makers of &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; and other Black miscastings.From an acting perspective, there's Black above all others.  White modestly stays in the background.  His girlfriend Patty (Sarah Silverman) is pretty much a one-note shrew (that's the role written for her).  Joan Cusack is great when she appears - her little moment gathering herself alone in a hallway in face of an onslaught of parents is the movie's one bit of dramatic acting.  The kids are really superb.  I assume that's really them playing those instruments.  There's none of the tricky camera work when musical fakery is involved (shots of the head, shots of the hand).

He really knows how to work the lines of a script, squeezing out as much funny as he possibly can.

So that's exactly what Dewey does. He poses as a teacher for a prestigious prep school, pretending to be the substitute teacher that Ned actually is. Dewey soon learns that the kids have more to offer than just proper English and poise-- they can really rock!It's charming and sweet, and the kids are absoultely adorable.

His latest collaborators have just kicked him out, so he spends his time sleeping and eating, until he intercepts a phone call meant for his roommate, who works as a substitute teacher.  When he finds out how much the job pays, he decides to fake his way into it, intending to slack off some more and pick up a paycheck.  Then he happens to catch the students at band practice, and discovers that his perfect rock band might be sitting right under his nose.Even though I really like most of Richard Linklater's films (WAKING LIFE, BEFORE SUNRISE, TAPE), I had no plans to see this one originally for a couple reasons:  1. I don't much care for kids in my films.  2. I don't much care for Jack Black; though he is amusing in smaller roles (HIGH FIDELITY) I was pretty sure he'd be intolerable as a central character.  But recently I saw the trailer and thought it looked like it might be kind of funny, so I decided to give it a chance.  It was much better than I expected.  Black keeps his manic act under control for the most part, and is quite entertaining (and his character becomes surprisingly likable once he gets his act together.)  The kids are - dare I say it? - actually charming.  And the script by Mike White (THE GOOD GIRL) is smart and funny.This film, which features a cast of nine to eleven year-olds, is rated PG-13 for ""rude humor and drug references.""  They say ""ass"" a few times and the ""drug references"" must have been so vague that I can't even remember any.  A beer is sipped gingerly at a restaurant, and Dewey mentions that he has a hangover on the first day of class.  Oh, I know what it was; Dewey says that one of the other teachers ""must be on crack.""  Anyway, you'd have to be insanely uptight to worry about any of these things.  I have no qualms about recommending this as a family film, an intelligent one that both kids and adults will enjoy because it doesn't talk down to either.  It's also a genuine feel-good movie, not in the fake, sugary way that makes you feel like throwing up.  It has a real heart, and even a little subversive edge to it.The DVD contains numerous extras including two commentary tracks (one with Black and Linklater which is moderately interesting, and one with the kids which is extremely annoying), behind the scenes footage, film festival footage, trailers, and a video plea they made to try to convince Led Zeppelin to let them use one of their songs.",4,Alternative education,1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,2544,"['Dewey', 'Finn', '30-something', 'slacker', 'aspirations', 'being', 'successful', 'rock', 'band', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'happen', 'latest', 'collaborators', 'have', 'just', 'kicked', 'out', 'time', 'sleeping', 'eating', 'phone', 'call', 'meant', 'roommate', 'who', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'When', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'job', 'pays', 'fake', 'way', 'intending', 'slack', 'off', 'more', 'pick', 'up', 'paycheck', 'Then', 'catch', 'students', 'band', 'practice', 'discovers', 'perfect', 'rock', 'band', 'might', 'be', 'sitting', 'right', 'nose.Even', 'really', 'most', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'films', 'WAKING', 'LIFE', 'BEFORE', 'SUNRISE', 'TAPE', 'had', 'plans', 'see', 'one', 'originally', 'couple', 'reasons', '1', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'kids', 'films', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'Jack', 'Black', 'amusing', 'smaller', 'roles', 'HIGH', 'FIDELITY', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', ""'d"", 'be', 'intolerable', 'central', 'character', 'recently', 'saw', 'trailer', 'thought', 'looked', 'might', 'be', 'kind', 'funny', 'decided', 'give', 'chance', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'Black', 'manic', 'act', 'control', 'most', 'part', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'character', 'surprisingly', 'likable', 'once', 'act', 'together', 'kids', 'are', 'dare', 'say', 'actually', 'charming', 'script', 'Mike', 'White', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'GIRL', 'smart', 'funny.This', 'film', 'cast', 'nine', 'eleven', 'year-olds', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'rude', 'humor', 'drug', 'references', 'say', 'ass', 'few', 'times', 'drug', 'references', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'vague', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'beer', 'sipped', 'gingerly', 'restaurant', 'Dewey', 'mentions', 'hangover', 'first', 'day', 'class', 'Oh', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'Dewey', 'one', 'other', 'teachers', 'must', 'be', 'crack', 'Anyway', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'insanely', 'uptight', 'worry', 'things', 'have', 'qualms', 'recommending', 'family', 'film', 'intelligent', 'one', 'kids', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', ""n't"", 'talk', 'also', 'genuine', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'not', 'fake', 'sugary', 'way', 'feel', 'throwing', 'up', 'real', 'heart', 'even', 'little', 'subversive', 'edge', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'numerous', 'extras', 'including', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'one', 'Black', 'Linklater', 'moderately', 'interesting', 'one', 'kids', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'scenes', 'footage', 'film', 'festival', 'footage', 'trailers', 'video', 'plea', 'made', 'try', 'convince', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'let', 'use', 'one', 'songs']",School of Rock

Any idiot could surmise the entire progression of the movie's plot before the opening credits finish rolling, and once the predictable plot proper gets underway, it isn't so bad. The kids (remarkable musicians, really) get more air time, the trivial social conflicts impeding Jack are largely resolved, and there appears to be a concert looming on the celluloid horizon.

Jack regularly herds the students into his van and then leaves them places while he conducts bits of business. And by and large the kids all stay put. Cripes. No given group of TEACHERS behaves so well. My own experiences with kid groups were somewhat different--i.e., weaving through a dark, people-packed aquarium while I obsessively counted to fifteen over and over again, praying that the bobbing heads I've numbered at least mostly belong to the actual kids in my actual care.

Desperately for money to pay his part of the rent - or else face eviction at the hands of Ned and his irksomely patronizing girlfriend, Patty (Sarah Silverman) - he intends to contribute nothing to the education of his young charges until a chance overhearing of their music class immediately fires him with the idea of turning them into a ""high-voltage"" rock band in order for them to compete with the people who had sacked him in a forthcoming rock band competition.With the predictable role of a ""rules-are-meant-to-be-broken"" maverick, Black blends comedy and humour into his alter ego, although one cannot at times help thinking that he tends to dominate the movie. There are hardly any scenes whatsoever in the movie in which Black does not feature, and so one tends to believe that it all centres more on the character of Finn as opposed to on the ones who make ""The School of Rock"" such a hit at the competition. I would have liked to have seen more character development from the supporting cast members - that is, from the youngsters - yet it seems that only their collective musical talent is allowed to have its day on stage as opposed to their abilities as actors, some of whom were making their movie debut.The only moment of real ""drama"" comes when drummer Freddy Jones (14-year-old Kevin Clark) is persuaded to join some guys from a rival band in their van when the kids go to an audition for the competition. Finn does his nut and effectively hauls the card-playing youngster out of the van out of concern that the guys might otherwise have their own agenda for him, though it was never made clear what that might have been.The moral of the story appears to be that rock (an analogy for life, perhaps?) is not about winning music contests, which was the raison d'etre for Finn wanting his class to perform, but about ""winning"" against ""The Man"" (an analogy for authority, personified by the Cusack character), something that even the youngsters hammer home to him in a kind of role reversal where the students teach the ""teacher"" a lesson in life.Overall, it is a good movie to watch, with some very catchy rock songs, although the music itself, like the Jack Black character, does tend to dominate right from the start (before the stars even have a chance to surround the Paramount Pictures mountain peak) to the very end. The music itself ought to have been more of a backdrop to the story yet it tended to become a bit too prominent.

It sounds so clich&eacute;d, and yet it's so true.  Jack Black plays his role perfectly, it could not have been done by anyone else.  What makes this movie so special is that it is completely hilarious, and yet has a great message for the viewer to remember.  Jack Black plays Dewey Finn, an overage rocker that sleeps in late, doesn't have a job, never had a job.  One day he answers the phone from a local prestigious elementary school, looking for a substitute teacher after the current teacher broke her leg and called out for the next couple of weeks.  He pretends to be his roommate, who is a certified teacher, and makes winners out of the students.  They are highly talented in music, and incredibly smart.  But, many of them don't have much faith in themselves.  One feels she's overweight, one thinks he's a loser, and so on.  Jack just just goes into the classroom and reverses their attitudes around.This is a movie that everyone should go out and see.

795617,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00018U9FW,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[1, 1]","I found this film to be extremely funny and worth repeated viewings.  Directed by Richard Linklater, who also did Slackers (1991), Dazed and Confused (1993), and SubUrbia (1996), The School of Rock (2003) stars the hyper-kinetic and unpredictable Jack Black in a role specifically written for him by co-star Mike White.Black plays Dewey Finn, a dedicated rocker who believes he and his band are on the verge of greatness, their main goal to win a locale battle of the Bands contest, get the prize money, recognition and, hopefully, a record contract.  Problem is Dewey tends to 'rock hard' on stage, which his band members feel is clownish and not fitting in with the image they want to project.  Thusly, Dewey soon finds himself voted out of the band and out of a means of income.  To top things off his meek roommate, Ned Schneebly (Mike White) and Ned's overbearing girlfriend, played by Sarah Silverman, decide Dewey must move out due to his inability to pay rent.  When it rains, it pours...Anyway, while pondering thoughts of his situation, Dewey takes a phone call for Ned, who is a substitute teacher.  An exclusive preparatory school needs someone to fill in, and on discovering the decent amount of money involved, Dewey pretends he is Ned, and takes the job.  What was going to be some quick money soon turns out to be more as Dewey learns that the children are musically inclined, and gets the idea to try and build a band around the youngsters, and compete in the upcoming Battle of the Bands contest.  He passes the idea off on the children as a secret school project, and thus their education into 'hard rockin' begins.Jack Black is the star of this movie, no doubt, with his spastic energy and erratic nature, but he certainly has a lot of help with his great supporting cast including Joan Cusack as the principal of the school (I am truly glad to see her back on the big screen as of late all I've been seeing her in is annoying wireless phone commercials) and all the talented children that comprise his class.  I was happy to see the filmmakers decided on going with a cast of relatively unknown children, rather than `cutesy', overused children we've seen in many other films.  And these children can truly perform, not only with acting, but also with their ability with their respective instruments.  The story is pretty classic one, a grown up somewhat forced into involvement with a group of children who soon finds he having an effect on his students, and, in turn, they are having an effect on him.  Personal growth develops all around, and we all get the warm fuzzies.  While some of other films of this nature tend to get a bit schmaltzy, The School of Rock seems to narrowly sidestep it, and avoids the tooth decaying sweetness so often involved in a stories like this one.And let's not forget the music...Led Zeppelin, Cream, The Ramones, AC/DC, The Who and many more.  I was glad to hear so many great, classic songs accompany the movie, enhancing the complete hard rocking experience that is The School of Rock.Special features are numerous, encompassing around four hours of material, but the best part for me was the inclusion of Jack Black's video pitch to legendary rock gods Led Zeppelin to use their Immigrant Song within the film.  Also included are separate commentaries by Black and the children, a video diary, trailers, interactive features, weblinks, a music video for the original song created for the finale, and more.While the plot of the movie is pretty far-fetched and requires the viewer to suspend a great deal of belief, it worked for me and was a truly satisfying way to spend an hour and fifty minutes.  If you liked Black and his musical abilities, you might want to check out his band, Tenacious D.  The CD and DVD are both available here.  I definitely look forward to seeing him in future projects.Cookieman108",5,"&quot;Dude, I service society by rocking!&quot;",1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,3868,"['found', 'film', 'be', 'extremely', 'funny', 'worth', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'Directed', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'Slackers', '1991', 'Dazed', 'Confused', '1993', 'SubUrbia', '1996', 'School', 'Rock', '2003', 'hyper-kinetic', 'unpredictable', 'Jack', 'Black', 'role', 'specifically', 'written', 'co-star', 'Mike', 'White.Black', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'dedicated', 'rocker', 'who', 'band', 'are', 'verge', 'greatness', 'main', 'goal', 'win', 'locale', 'battle', 'Bands', 'contest', 'get', 'prize', 'money', 'recognition', 'hopefully', 'record', 'contract', 'Problem', 'Dewey', ""'rock"", 'hard', 'stage', 'band', 'members', 'feel', 'clownish', 'not', 'fitting', 'image', 'want', 'project', 'Thusly', 'Dewey', 'soon', 'voted', 'band', 'means', 'income', 'top', 'things', 'meek', 'roommate', 'Ned', 'Schneebly', 'Mike', 'White', 'Ned', 'overbearing', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'decide', 'Dewey', 'must', 'move', 'out', 'due', 'inability', 'pay', 'rent', 'When', 'Anyway', 'pondering', 'thoughts', 'situation', 'Dewey', 'phone', 'call', 'Ned', 'who', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'exclusive', 'preparatory', 'school', 'someone', 'fill', 'discovering', 'decent', 'amount', 'money', 'involved', 'Dewey', 'Ned', 'job', 'What', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'quick', 'money', 'soon', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'Dewey', 'children', 'are', 'musically', 'inclined', 'idea', 'try', 'build', 'band', 'youngsters', 'compete', 'upcoming', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'contest', 'idea', 'children', 'secret', 'school', 'project', 'thus', 'education', ""'hard"", 'rockin', 'begins.Jack', 'Black', 'star', 'movie', 'doubt', 'spastic', 'energy', 'erratic', 'nature', 'certainly', 'lot', 'help', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'principal', 'school', 'am', 'truly', 'glad', 'see', 'back', 'big', 'screen', 'late', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seeing', 'annoying', 'wireless', 'phone', 'commercials', 'talented', 'children', 'comprise', 'class', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'filmmakers', 'decided', 'going', 'cast', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'children', 'rather', 'cutesy', 'overused', 'children', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'children', 'can', 'truly', 'perform', 'not', 'only', 'acting', 'also', 'ability', 'respective', 'instruments', 'story', 'pretty', 'classic', 'one', 'grown', 'up', 'somewhat', 'forced', 'involvement', 'group', 'children', 'who', 'soon', 'having', 'effect', 'students', 'turn', 'are', 'having', 'effect', 'Personal', 'growth', 'get', 'warm', 'fuzzies', 'other', 'films', 'nature', 'tend', 'get', 'bit', 'schmaltzy', 'School', 'Rock', 'narrowly', 'sidestep', 'tooth', 'decaying', 'sweetness', 'so', 'often', 'involved', 'stories', 'one.And', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'music', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Cream', 'Ramones', 'AC/DC', 'Who', 'many', 'more', 'was', 'glad', 'hear', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'classic', 'songs', 'movie', 'enhancing', 'complete', 'hard', 'rocking', 'experience', 'School', 'Rock.Special', 'features', 'are', 'numerous', 'encompassing', 'four', 'hours', 'material', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'inclusion', 'Jack', 'Black', 'video', 'pitch', 'legendary', 'rock', 'gods', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'use', 'Immigrant', 'Song', 'film', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'separate', 'commentaries', 'Black', 'children', 'video', 'diary', 'trailers', 'interactive', 'features', 'weblinks', 'music', 'video', 'original', 'song', 'created', 'finale', 'plot', 'movie', 'pretty', 'far-fetched', 'viewer', 'suspend', 'great', 'deal', 'belief', 'worked', 'was', 'truly', 'satisfying', 'way', 'spend', 'hour', 'fifty', 'minutes', 'liked', 'Black', 'musical', 'abilities', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'band', 'Tenacious', 'D.', 'CD', 'DVD', 'are', 'available', 'here', 'definitely', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'future', 'projects.Cookieman108']",School of Rock

They are notoriously difficult to deal with and invariably end up stealing every scene. Jack Black, star of raunchy comedies, like Orange County, is not the first person you'd think of to headline a kid's film backed by a Hollywood studio. It's even stranger that said film is directed by Richard Linklater, known primarily for making acclaimed independent films like Slacker. Added into the mix is a script written by Mike White, who is responsible for provocative films, like The Good Girl. And yet all of these diverse elements combine to produce School of Rock, one of the funniest and most entertaining comedies to come out of a major studio in a long time.On the DVD, Jack Black and Richard Linklater contribute a spirited and informative commentary track. This is a really funny commentary track as Linklater and Black play well off each other, talking and joking in a relaxed manner. This is most definitely a must-listen for fans of both men as it is the first time either one has done a commentary.There is a commentary track by the kids in the band. It comes across as a little chaotic because of the number of participants but they all seem to be having a blast watching the film together and talking about their experiences working with Jack Black on a big time Hollywood movie.&quot;MTV's Diary of Jack Black&quot; is a promotional bit that follows Black around for a typically frenetic day as he gets ready to make the movie. Fortunately, he knows it's all promotional BS and hams it up appropriately.&quot;Lessons Learned in School of Rock&quot; is a making of featurette. There is some sweet footage of Jack Black and the kids recording music for the movie at Sonic Youth's studio with Jim O'Rourke. The movie gets instant cool points for having musicians like O'Rourke and the Von Bodies on board to help out.One of the best extras on the disc is &quot;Jack Black's Pitch to Led Zeppelin.&quot; Black wanted to have &quot;The Immigrant Song&quot; in the movie but Led Zep has a reputation of rarely allowing their music to be used. So, Linklater suggested Black film an open plea to the band, asking them permission to use the song.Also included is a music video for the title song from the movie and &quot;Kids' Video Diary: Toronto Film Festival&quot; that follows the kids from the movie around for the day as School of Rock debuts at the prestigious Toronto International Film Festival.While School of Rock deviates little from The Bad News Bears formula-you'll see the ending coming a mile away-it is really a fun and entertaining ride. You have to love any movie that teaches kids to listen to Led Zeppelin and The Ramones instead of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.",5,Kick Out The Jams!,1078185600,"03 2, 2004",2004,2789,"['say', 'two', 'things', 'should', 'never', 'work', 'movie', 'are', 'animals', 'children', 'are', 'notoriously', 'difficult', 'deal', 'invariably', 'end', 'up', 'stealing', 'scene', 'Jack', 'Black', 'star', 'raunchy', 'comedies', 'Orange', 'County', 'not', 'first', 'person', ""'d"", 'think', 'headline', 'kid', 'film', 'backed', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'even', 'stranger', 'said', 'film', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'known', 'primarily', 'making', 'acclaimed', 'independent', 'films', 'Slacker', 'Added', 'mix', 'script', 'written', 'Mike', 'White', 'who', 'responsible', 'provocative', 'films', 'Good', 'Girl', 'yet', 'diverse', 'elements', 'combine', 'produce', 'School', 'Rock', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'entertaining', 'comedies', 'come', 'major', 'studio', 'long', 'time.On', 'DVD', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'contribute', 'spirited', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'really', 'funny', 'commentary', 'track', 'Linklater', 'Black', 'play', 'well', 'other', 'talking', 'joking', 'relaxed', 'manner', 'most', 'definitely', 'must-listen', 'fans', 'men', 'first', 'time', 'one', 'done', 'commentary.There', 'commentary', 'track', 'kids', 'band', 'little', 'chaotic', 'number', 'participants', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'blast', 'watching', 'film', 'together', 'talking', 'experiences', 'working', 'Jack', 'Black', 'big', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'movie.', 'quot', 'MTV', 'Diary', 'Jack', 'Black', 'quot', 'promotional', 'bit', 'Black', 'typically', 'frenetic', 'day', 'ready', 'make', 'movie', 'Fortunately', 'promotional', 'BS', 'hams', 'up', 'appropriately.', 'quot', 'Lessons', 'Learned', 'School', 'Rock', 'quot', 'making', 'featurette', 'sweet', 'footage', 'Jack', 'Black', 'kids', 'recording', 'music', 'movie', 'Sonic', 'Youth', 'studio', 'Jim', ""O'Rourke"", 'movie', 'instant', 'cool', 'points', 'having', 'musicians', ""O'Rourke"", 'Von', 'Bodies', 'board', 'help', 'out.One', 'best', 'extras', 'disc', 'quot', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Pitch', 'Led', 'Zeppelin.', 'quot', 'Black', 'wanted', 'have', 'quot', 'Immigrant', 'Song', 'quot', 'movie', 'Led', 'Zep', 'reputation', 'rarely', 'allowing', 'music', 'be', 'used', 'So', 'Linklater', 'suggested', 'Black', 'film', 'open', 'plea', 'band', 'asking', 'permission', 'use', 'song.Also', 'included', 'music', 'video', 'title', 'song', 'movie', 'quot', 'Kids', 'Video', 'Diary', 'Toronto', 'Film', 'Festival', 'quot', 'kids', 'movie', 'day', 'School', 'Rock', 'debuts', 'prestigious', 'Toronto', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival.While', 'School', 'Rock', 'deviates', 'little', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'formula-you', ""'ll"", 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'mile', 'away-it', 'really', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'have', 'love', 'movie', 'kids', 'listen', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Ramones', 'instead', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'Christina', 'Aguilera']",School of Rock

And I didn't really think I'd like ""School of Rock"" terribly much, but it wasn't that bad. Actually, it was pretty good. I enjoyed it, and I would allow my kids to watch it, too.Black, like in many other roles, portrays the loser - the guy that really isn't doing anything with his life - until he is sort of inadvertently given the opportunity to substitute teach at the best elementary school in town. Easy, right? Recess all day long, no worries. Wrong. Of course the school is completely filled with baby overacheivers.To make a long story short, Black ends up teaching these kids the only thing he knows, and the only thing they don't: rock 'n roll.He creates a band using the kids' talents, ending in playing, and being a huge success, in the Battle of the Bands.In all, Black's character teaches the kids valuable life lessons: there's more to life than looks, music can be fun, everyone's put here for a reason. Trends where morals are cool have been happening not only in ""School of Rock,"" but also in smash films like ""Shrek."" I think that a film like this is not only fun, but okay for the kids. They won't leave it feeling like they have to be perfect, but that flawed is cool.The writing is also rather smart. It appeals to older fans with scenes with Jack Black and the rock music, but ""School of Rock"" also appeals to the younger audience because most of the cast is comprised of, well, a younger crowd.Overall, ""School of Rock"" is pleasing to just about any audience.

This film desplicts Dewey Finn (Black) who's struggled tremendously for years to become a famous rocker.  After he is fired from his band, he poses as a substitute teacher and uses his brother's name.  There, he begins a new rock band with a twist.  The fellow members are kids in his class.  Finn and the class must keep this a secret to prevent this act from being exposed to the school board and the community.Though the film is cheesy in numerous scenes, its comedic form makes the film details fit well to one another.  Through the music and the laughs, this film remains unique throughout.  All the details give new comedic meaning to rock music: the quotes, the personalities, the costumes, the performances, and others.  This desplicts accurately the life of a true struggling musician while adding a one-of-a-kind entertaining theme.  All performers add their own sense of plot throughout the film, especially Jack Black in his Golden Globe nominated role for Best Actor in a Comedy Film.  This is in no doubt his career's best, which he proves he was ""made for that role"".""School of Rock"" is a great comedy for viewing pleasure of a variety of audiences.

It is not HD or Blue Ray, but it plays and looks great on my blue ray player.There is really nothing wrong with the copy, and for that alone this would get 5 stars. But I rate dvds on their bonus material, especially the commentary, since this is where the added value is for me.  And in this aspect, I think the value could be higher. The commentary was very half-assed. I don't mind the commentators goofing off or even digressing wildly - often this provides valuable insights into these personalities. But I expect a certain amount of discussion of the film, its production, the development of the story, the actors' interpretation of and improvisation with their roles, etc. The commentary section was very mediocre. Not bad, just not great. Hence 4 stars. If I was rating just the commentary, It'd be 2 stars.The redeeming qualities come with the many other special features: the kids have a commentary track, and the kids have a video diary of the showing of School of Rock at the Toronto film festival; there is a fun music video of a song one of the kids (in the story line), and other such features.

What is great about these kids is that they can actually play their instruments well, and some can sing beautifully.  This is that rarest of films, a children's ensemble.

Sure, the 'Jack Black' types were the pudgy urchins who loved nothing better than to push the envelope, but they were still annoying enough to disrupt a grand party or, sin of sins, make a pass at a preppy girl.  Thus, the wedgies were administered, while those of us on the superficial side of the intellectual chain couldn't help but admire the 'stick it to the man' mentality of these Pillsbury doughboys.Hence the appeal of THE SCHOOL OF ROCK, a cute little flick that allows beady-eyed Jack Black to romp and chomp and stomp through a formulaic, totally predictable plot.  As rock superstar wannabe Dewey Finn, Black plays a loose cannon (er, himself) who is short on talent, but long on rock 'n roll fantasy.  When his band dumps him, and he finds himself behind on his rent, he steals the identity of his zombie roommate and pretends to be a 5th grade teacher at a prim and proper prep school.  He has zero teaching skills, but--lucky for him--he does recognize he's been given a class of pre-adolescents who collectively possess the talent he needs to live out his dream:  to put together a kick arse rock band.And so the school's curriculum is tossed overboard like a bucket of shrimp to sharks, as Dewey shapes and nurtures and cultivates his young charges into a stage band extraordinaire.  Granted, the 'suspension of disbelief' police come calling (How can all of these 10-year-olds be so obscenely talented?), yet Black shamelessly--or better yet, shamefully--pulls everything together as he enters his new creation into a 'Battle of the Bands' contest.  He also collectively pulls the wool over the eyes of the prep school's administration, along with the parents of his new entourage.  By the time Dewey is ""outed,"" it's too late:  The School of Rock is on center stage, playing a gig that brings down the house.Jack Black carries this movie on his nine-course shoulders; Joan Cusack, who plays Black's hesitant, somewhat suspicious supervisor, so reminds me of a great date I once had that I wanted no one else to know about.  As mentioned before, the plot is predictable, even lame, but THE SCHOOL OF ROCK entertains, simply because rock is rock--even when being played by diaper dandies.

Jack Black stars as Dewey Finn, a down-on-his-luck rock musician who is out of work and out of excuses.  Well, with a little fast talking and identity theft Finn takes the identity of his zombie roommate and assumes the role of substitute teacher at a prestigious academy.  The kids he is to teach are expecting him to teach standard school subjects.  Dewey, a rock musician, is not prepared to teach them anything.  But, there is one subject that touches his soul--that is rock music.  It turns out that several of his students are musically inclined, and they end up developing a musical ensemble, while avoiding the suspicious unlooking of an uptight  school superintendent (Joan Cusak).  This is pure fantasy, but, Jack Black is a terrific physical comedian [comparable, perhaps, to the late, great Chris Farley].  The kids are hilarious and come from varying backgrounds and it's wonderful to watch Dewey bring them to life with music.  From what I have heard, this is one of the better Jack Black films.

I was initially attracted by the cover featuring a rendition of Tarot Card # 15: &quot;The Devil&quot;. When it comes to music, as anyone will inform you, Jack Black loves to, above all, ROCK. He tends to focus on the rather exaggerated and epic aesthetics reminiscent to that of the Spinal Tap and KISS spectacles with a musical bent partial to Led Zeppelin and AC/DC in particular with a contagiously exuberant effervescence and comedy-style conducive to an eternal man-child, which is always a pleasure to observe, and with the right person, even participate in.Now the lokian jester has Quang Jin Fong Amanahoed in another film {for those unfamiliar, he has also been an actor for a number of years, acting in primarily bit parts in releases such as &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; and &quot;Saving Silverman&quot;} named &quot;School of Rock&quot; in which he plays a musician in need of some quick money - but being unemployed and recently ousted from his own band, who were basically jealous because he frequently &quot;stole the spotlight&quot; with his prolonged guitar solos and stage-diving antics; so from this, he seeks revenge upon those who did not appreciate his talent, subsequently garnering the cooperation of some 4th-graders to revive his Heavy Metal vision, by impersonating a &quot;Mr. Sneebley&quot;, his room-mate, disillusioned ex-band-mate, and substitute teacher, intercepting a call intended for him.He eventually meets up with the Principal {Joan Cusack, whom you may recall as playing the role of the despicable &quot;Debbie Jilinsky&quot; from Addams Family Values}, and after a series of secret musical instructions, convinces her through charm and inebriation to allow his class to go on a specialized &quot;field trip&quot; for some Beethoven, but is really &quot;The Battle of The Bands&quot;. So after determining each student's talent, places them to participate in the aptly named &quot;School of Rock&quot;, and they perform marvelously despite the protests from horrified parents {who along with the Principal, learned that he was an imposter}, and a doubtful event promoter {whom Finn convinced to have them perform because they were dying from a rare disease - which sounded remarkably similar to &quot;stick it to the man&quot;}.Quite a fun movie overall, and I also particularly enjoyed the ending sequence during the &quot;concluding jam&quot;, as it were.The DVD includes a &quot;making of&quot; featurette , &quot;The Diary of Jack Black&quot; {in which he visits K.G. for an improvised session with the complete D!}, the kids' diary, the music video, previews, and an imploration unto Led Zeppelin, that they allow a song of theirs be included in the film, which it was.So there you have it - the character of Dewy Finn and Jack Black are not at all too far removed, and this film works around his personality.",4,The Birdman cometh!,1091232000,"07 31, 2004",2004,3339,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'are', 'familiar', 'career', 'Jack', 'Black', 'first', 'became', 'acquainted', 'work', 'musical', 'project', 'quot', 'Tenacious', 'D', 'quot', 'friend', 'have', 'received', 'much', 'amusement', 'antics', 'then', 'inclusive', 'collecting', 'downloadable', 'music', 'including', 'rare', 'hilarious', 'pieces', 'quot', 'Sasquach', 'quot', 'quot', 'Spiderman', 'quot', 'vocal', 'version', 'Star', 'Trek', 'theme', 'do', 'perform', 'concerts', 'incidentally', 'was', 'initially', 'attracted', 'cover', 'featuring', 'rendition', 'Tarot', 'Card', '15', 'quot', 'Devil', 'quot', 'When', 'music', 'anyone', 'will', 'inform', 'Jack', 'Black', 'ROCK', 'focus', 'rather', 'exaggerated', 'epic', 'aesthetics', 'reminiscent', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'KISS', 'spectacles', 'musical', 'bent', 'partial', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'AC/DC', 'particular', 'contagiously', 'exuberant', 'effervescence', 'comedy-style', 'conducive', 'eternal', 'man-child', 'always', 'pleasure', 'observe', 'right', 'person', 'even', 'participate', 'lokian', 'jester', 'Quang', 'Jin', 'Fong', 'Amanahoed', 'film', 'unfamiliar', 'also', 'been', 'actor', 'number', 'years', 'acting', 'primarily', 'bit', 'parts', 'releases', 'such', 'quot', 'Shallow', 'Hal', 'quot', 'quot', 'Saving', 'Silverman', 'quot', 'named', 'quot', 'School', 'Rock', 'quot', 'musician', 'need', 'quick', 'money', 'being', 'unemployed', 'recently', 'ousted', 'own', 'band', 'who', 'were', 'basically', 'jealous', 'frequently', 'quot', 'spotlight', 'quot', 'prolonged', 'guitar', 'solos', 'stage-diving', 'antics', 'so', 'revenge', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'talent', 'subsequently', 'garnering', 'cooperation', '4th-graders', 'revive', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'vision', 'impersonating', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Sneebley', 'quot', 'room-mate', 'disillusioned', 'ex-band-mate', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'intercepting', 'call', 'intended', 'him.He', 'eventually', 'up', 'Principal', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'whom', 'may', 'recall', 'playing', 'role', 'despicable', 'quot', 'Debbie', 'Jilinsky', 'quot', 'Addams', 'Family', 'Values', 'series', 'secret', 'musical', 'instructions', 'convinces', 'charm', 'inebriation', 'allow', 'class', 'go', 'specialized', 'quot', 'field', 'trip', 'quot', 'Beethoven', 'really', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'quot', 'So', 'determining', 'student', 'talent', 'participate', 'aptly', 'named', 'quot', 'School', 'Rock', 'quot', 'perform', 'marvelously', 'protests', 'horrified', 'parents', 'who', 'Principal', 'learned', 'was', 'imposter', 'doubtful', 'event', 'promoter', 'whom', 'Finn', 'convinced', 'have', 'perform', 'were', 'dying', 'rare', 'disease', 'sounded', 'remarkably', 'similar', 'quot', 'stick', 'man', 'quot', '.Quite', 'fun', 'movie', 'overall', 'also', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'ending', 'sequence', 'quot', 'concluding', 'jam', 'quot', 'DVD', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'featurette', 'quot', 'Diary', 'Jack', 'Black', 'quot', 'K.G', 'improvised', 'session', 'complete', 'D', 'kids', 'diary', 'music', 'video', 'previews', 'imploration', 'unto', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'allow', 'song', 'theirs', 'be', 'included', 'film', 'there', 'have', 'character', 'Dewy', 'Finn', 'Jack', 'Black', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'film', 'personality']",School of Rock

795641,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,B00018U9FW,Duane Thomas,"[1, 2]","Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a 30-something musical wannabe who's never given up on his dreams of rock 'n' roll stardom, specifically winning the $20,000 grand prize at the local annual Battle of the Bands. A few teeny-tiny problems with that plan: he's arrogant, immature, and not much in the way of a singer, songwriter, guitar player, or responsible human being. He's a lot like Black's rock snob character in High Fidelity, just a little older, a (very) little wiser, but still a socially maladept loser.And he's having a day the stuff that nightmares are made of. Dewey gets kicked out of his band. His wimpy roommate Ned Schneebly (Mike White, who also wrote the screenplay), under the influence of a harpy girlfriend (Sarah Silverman, last seen lipping off in a parking lot before being clocked by Ryan Phillippe in Way of the Gun, and sporting a similarly endearing personality here) gives Dewey an ultimatum: get a ""real job,"" come up with current and back rent, or vacate the premises. The life of the true artiste is tortured by contact with small minds, y'know?The phone rings, offering Ned a substitute teacher gig at Horace Green, a veddy correct, upper-crust prep-type elementary school. Dewey answers and sees the solution to his money problem. He poses as Ned, and is assigned his own class of young minds to shape. Spying on his students in music class, he sees they already have an accomplished keyboard artist, guitarist, etc. (albeit they only play classical) and a ""brilliant"" plan is born. Dewey will form them into his own personal band, teach them the hows and whys and joys of kickbutt rock 'n' roll, and go on to win the Battle of the Bands. Desperately inventing jobs for the students without musical skills, he tasks three girls to name the band. They exceed his wildest expectations with an ultra-cool and totally appropriate suggestion: The School of Rock.Let's admit it right now: School of Rock is a formula movie. We know going in that Dewey will come to treasure the kids and vice versa, he'll grow in the process, the kids will also blossom under his unlikely tutelage, and in the end fun will be had by all (after the obligatory but easily overcome Moment When All Seems Lost). But that's unimportant. Blinding originality is not a prerequisite to have a good movie. I give School of Rock 5 stars not because it's great entertainment in a Citizen Kane way, but because it so perfectly accomplishes what it sets out to do: be a thoroughly enjoyable light comedy and star vehicle for Jack Black.This is an amazingly sweet-tempered film. There are no real bad guys (well, except the Girlfriend From Heck, but Ned - the real Ned - needs to clue in and dump her for his own good anyway). The straitlaced, control freak school principal (Joan Cusack) could be the bad guy, and in a different sort of movie might, but in School of Rock she's instead a decent person who just takes her responsibilities way too seriously. (And I have to ask: when did Joan Cusack get so incredibly HOT? Did I miss something?) Job stress is killing her, and she knows it. When Dewey/Ned takes her on a not-date to a local pub, she gets a little tipsy and tells him, ""I wasn't always like this, you know. I wasn't always wound this tight. There was a time when I was fun. I was funny. I was.""Jack Black brings immense energy and impeccable comedic timing to the role of Dewey Finn. Joan Cusack not only matches his skill at light comedy, but their characters have a surprising level of real chemistry going. I'd like to see these two together again, in a romantic comedy. The kids are appealing. Watching Dewey relate to them, dealing with all their ego problems, individual faults and talents, building them up, holding them together, becoming almost despite himself a real band leader and effective father figure/surrogate big brother, is a kick. This movie lives or dies on our liking all these people. Fortunately they're very easy to like.In the end, everything works out (of course), the concert comes off like gangbusters, the kids have a great time, Dewey becomes a better person, and all is right in the School of Rock.",5,A Near-Perfect Light Comedy,1086912000,"06 11, 2004",2004,4136,"['Dewey', 'Finn', 'Jack', 'Black', '30-something', 'musical', 'wannabe', 'who', 'never', 'given', 'up', 'dreams', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'stardom', 'specifically', 'winning', '20,000', 'grand', 'prize', 'local', 'annual', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'few', 'teeny-tiny', 'problems', 'plan', 'arrogant', 'immature', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'singer', 'songwriter', 'guitar', 'player', 'responsible', 'human', 'being', 'lot', 'Black', 'rock', 'snob', 'character', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'just', 'little', 'older', 'very', 'little', 'wiser', 'still', 'socially', 'maladept', 'loser.And', 'having', 'day', 'stuff', 'nightmares', 'are', 'made', 'Dewey', 'kicked', 'band', 'wimpy', 'roommate', 'Ned', 'Schneebly', 'Mike', 'White', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'influence', 'harpy', 'girlfriend', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'last', 'seen', 'lipping', 'off', 'parking', 'lot', 'being', 'clocked', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'Way', 'Gun', 'sporting', 'similarly', 'endearing', 'personality', 'here', 'Dewey', 'ultimatum', 'get', 'real', 'job', 'up', 'current', 'back', 'rent', 'vacate', 'premises', 'life', 'true', 'artiste', 'tortured', 'contact', 'small', 'minds', ""y'know"", 'phone', 'rings', 'offering', 'Ned', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'gig', 'Horace', 'Green', 'veddy', 'correct', 'upper-crust', 'prep-type', 'elementary', 'school', 'Dewey', 'answers', 'solution', 'money', 'problem', 'as', 'Ned', 'assigned', 'own', 'class', 'young', 'minds', 'shape', 'Spying', 'students', 'music', 'class', 'already', 'have', 'accomplished', 'keyboard', 'artist', 'guitarist', 'etc', 'only', 'play', 'classical', 'brilliant', 'plan', 'born', 'Dewey', 'will', 'form', 'own', 'personal', 'band', 'teach', 'hows', 'whys', 'joys', 'kickbutt', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'go', 'win', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'Desperately', 'inventing', 'jobs', 'students', 'musical', 'skills', 'tasks', 'three', 'girls', 'name', 'band', 'exceed', 'wildest', 'expectations', 'ultra-cool', 'totally', 'appropriate', 'suggestion', 'School', 'Rock.Let', 'admit', 'right', 'now', 'School', 'Rock', 'formula', 'movie', 'know', 'going', 'Dewey', 'will', 'come', 'treasure', 'kids', 'vice', 'versa', ""'ll"", 'grow', 'process', 'kids', 'will', 'also', 'blossom', 'unlikely', 'tutelage', 'end', 'fun', 'will', 'be', 'had', 'obligatory', 'easily', 'overcome', 'Moment', 'When', 'Seems', 'Lost', 'unimportant', 'Blinding', 'originality', 'not', 'prerequisite', 'have', 'good', 'movie', 'give', 'School', 'Rock', '5', 'stars', 'not', 'great', 'entertainment', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'way', 'so', 'perfectly', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'light', 'comedy', 'star', 'vehicle', 'Jack', 'Black.This', 'amazingly', 'sweet-tempered', 'film', 'are', 'real', 'bad', 'guys', 'well', 'Girlfriend', 'From', 'Heck', 'Ned', 'real', 'Ned', 'clue', 'dump', 'own', 'good', 'anyway', 'straitlaced', 'control', 'freak', 'school', 'principal', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'could', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'different', 'sort', 'movie', 'might', 'School', 'Rock', 'instead', 'decent', 'person', 'who', 'just', 'responsibilities', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'have', 'ask', 'when', 'did', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'get', 'so', 'incredibly', 'HOT', 'Did', 'miss', 'something', 'Job', 'stress', 'killing', 'When', 'Dewey/Ned', 'not-date', 'local', 'pub', 'little', 'tipsy', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'wound', 'tight', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'fun', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'Jack', 'Black', 'immense', 'energy', 'impeccable', 'comedic', 'timing', 'role', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'not', 'only', 'skill', 'light', 'comedy', 'characters', 'have', 'surprising', 'level', 'real', 'chemistry', 'going', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'two', 'together', 'again', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'kids', 'are', 'appealing', 'Watching', 'Dewey', 'relate', 'dealing', 'ego', 'problems', 'individual', 'faults', 'talents', 'building', 'up', 'holding', 'together', 'becoming', 'almost', 'real', 'band', 'leader', 'effective', 'father', 'figure/surrogate', 'big', 'brother', 'kick', 'movie', 'liking', 'people', 'Fortunately', ""'re"", 'very', 'easy', 'like.In', 'end', 'everything', 'works', 'out', 'course', 'concert', 'gangbusters', 'kids', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'Dewey', 'better', 'person', 'right', 'School', 'Rock']",School of Rock

He plays an unemployed rock musician named Dewey Finn who is abruptly dumped by his band before a big performance.  Dewey  has an encyclopedic knowledge of rock music, which is his life's passion.  Unfortunately, he has no income, and he is on the verge of being tossed out on the street by his long-suffering friend, Ned, for not paying his rent.  Desperate for a buck, Dewey poses as Ned to get a substitute-teaching gig in a fancy prep school.Sounds logical, right?  Try this on for size. Dewey knows nothing about teaching, so he organizes his tightly wound and upwardly mobile students into a rock band.  The versatile Joan Cusack plays the buttoned-down and intense principal, Rosalie Mullins, who is oblivious to the raucous sounds emanating from Dewey's classroom.Why does &quot;School of Rock&quot; work, considering that it is so preposterous?  First of all, the director, Richard Linklater, tailored the movie around the special talents of the manic Jack Black.  Black's uninhibited acting style is perfect for this role and his unbridled enthusiasm helps the audience to go with the flow.  Not for one second did I believe that any of the goings-on in this movie could happen in our galaxy, but I laughed so hard that my stomach hurt.  The physical comedy is marvelous.  The children who play Dewey's students are appealing.  There are even several touching scenes, especially one in which Dewey encourages a heavy-set student to accept herself the way she is and to be proud of her considerable talent.&quot;School of Rock&quot; has plenty of conventional elements, but the far from conventional Jack Black is an absolute hoot.

795645,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00018U9FW,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","SCHOOL OF ROCK (2003, 110 minutes) may not necessarily be labeled Jack Black's premiere film, but I found it lots of fun. I had never seen this oft-mentioned film; I have to say I was confused even at the middle of the film. Its comic value is fantastic and the children are all stunning performers ... I just had to ask myself what message the film was trying to convey.Briefly, Jack plays Dewey Finn, a washed-up has-been middle-aged rocker who is fired from his own band. So far so good: that could have been a terrific, biting satire base right there. But then he hornswaggles a gradeschool with his best friend's identity as a substitute teacher, in order to make some money. He ends up subbing at a prestigious prep grade school. He teaches the kids how to 'rock out' and appreciate the music. A bite of satire aimed at MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS and a well deserved one at that.But I had to ask myself: since it is pure satirical comedy, does there have to be a message? When it has a cast that is 98% children, then yes, it needs a meaning. Even a silly film has to tell us what they are trying to say about children and our relationship to children. I realize the excellent satire and social commentary in the film, but it just isn't that strong. Jack Black displays his genius here that later landed him so many great film roles.Aside from reliving a few memories from the oldest of the rock music, what was this? A parody of DEAD POET'S SOCIETY? A shot at the first two HARRY POTTER movies that had already been released by this time? An ode to rock-n-roll (which you can't really do with children this age)? What was it?The only balance to the genius of Jack Black was Joan Cusack, who displays here her own bulging comic genius so much that I felt Jack kind of shrinking in her presence a little. That was fun.And why so many questions about the message here? Well, this is a fun family film but I found Black's antics a bit much and perhaps not for everyone; rock music is not everyone's cup of tea; the message about education seemed way off also.

795646,A15TNUM2PBS6F0,B00018U9FW,"Ei ""crzybookmoovielover""","[3, 3]","After seeing the previews of ""School of Rock"", I highly anticipated seeing it in the theaters. It is the best movie I have seen in the theaters this year and I highly recommend it all fans of Black, Rock, and smiling to head straight to the closest theater playing this fantastic, awesome, and all around wildly entertaining hour and 45 minutes.Black is hysterically funny. My sides were splitting from laughing so much at his goofy rocker character, Dewey Finn. Especially his eyebrows.Dewey has just been kicked out of  his band and decides to start his own band.  The Horace Finn school calls looking for Ned Scheebly (played by the screenwriter of the movie, Mike White) a substitute teacher, Dewey answers the phone. He desperately needs cash to pay his rent so he pretends to be Ned. Now, at this juncture in many comedies, this is where the film should lose much of it's audience. However, Jack Black's antics and wildly goofy behavior keep you.His students are all in 5th grade, and when he finds out some of them play instruments, his mind and eyebrows concoct a brilliant scheme.  His old band is entering a battle of the bands so he decides to create his own pre-teen band and enter the contest as well.  The guitarist kid is amazing!!!  All the children did a great job, and seemed to be having a blast with Black.  He's just a big kid himself after all.Eventually, he is found out thanks to Ned's annoying and controlling girlfriend played by Sara Silverman. I remember her from ""greg the bunny"", a very short lived sitcom.  We have a film with an uplifting happy ending that sends you home with a smile on your face as you go searching through your c.d. collection for some AC/DC.Also, I thought Joan Cusack was quite comical as the uptight school Prinicpal. Black works well with both Cusacks(John is High Fidelity)And thanks to Mike White for confirming to me that you aren't a total nutcase screenwriter(also wrote Chuck & Buck and The good girl).

Original, witty and typical Jack Black comedy weave together with a fresh plot and of course, rock music, making this film a true delight and a great hour and a half to giggle.Dewie (Black),  is a failed guitarist bagging off, negletting rent payments and tormented by a hideous girlfriend of his room mate and best bud. When forced to get a real job, Dewie convieniantly weaves hinself into a snobby elementory school where he is expected to subsitute for a particular class. Eventually, Dewie discovers that this particular class is full of very musically talented ten-year-olds. Here, Dewie cooks up a plan to get the entire class prepared for &quot;The Battle of the Bands&quot;, a renowned Rock Music Competition. Thus, the School of Rock is created.Overall, I thought this movie was wonderful! And surprisingly, there are fairly imported morals in this film (particularly some strong ones for any parents out there) that really give this film a senstive side. But, of course, our hero, Mr Black doesn't let mushy messages intrude on his comedy, which is HALARIOUS! As I said, very original, very funny, 10 out of 10.And of course, this review cannot finish without mentioning the music. I love it. Being not a huge fan of rock, I kind of felt I learnt a bit of respect for the gods and goddesses of Rock. The music is fun, catchy, great melodies, and includes many old-school classics such as the timeless &quot;Fish Out of Water&quot;.

795660,AJXP2ONZ1AB9D,B00018U9FW,Grant Reed,"[2, 2]","While School of Rock is billed as a comedy, I found it more related to Shakespearian comedies than say recent movie comedy. That is to say that no one died and overall it had a good ending. I was surprised to find very few laugh-out-loud moments in this movie. Maybe I'm just a tough audience, but that was my take. That isn't to say I didn't enjoy it.As a matter of fact, I quite enjoyed it. This is something of a feel good story, and it is fun, which is something I always enjoy in movies. While the story leaves a certain number of blatant holes, such as how easy it would be to be invited to a prestigious prep school as a substitute, it is enjoyable enough that I can forgive the unlikely plausibility.Central to School of Rock is the music. By this I mean that the themes revolve around music not that music is what it is all about. Rock is what molds the protagonist, Dewey Finn, and puts him into the situation that starts the basic plot. Rock is what pulls him out of the funk that he finds himself in, and what gets him into a bit more trouble.The kids are what make the movie though, and I enjoyed the fact that they play so well. The kids do offer the opportunity for Dewey to change (a little) and to offer his own wisdom to help them through the rather convoluted (or weak) issues they experience, such as being cool, stage fright, and pressure from both peers and parents.My favorite part was the concert at the end of the movie. In the concert, one gets to see the fun of rock and roll, both during the performance and at the conclusion of the performance.I think I would have enjoyed a little bit more on the history of rock, other than just a diagram, but that is something that is a minor concern.I would recommend this movie as a light repast. It isn't very serious, and it isn't over-the-top comedic, but it is fun, for at least an hour and forty minutes or so. I give it 3  stars, which I rounded up.As far as extras, they were okay, but they were neither a deal maker, or deal breaker.I enjoyed the Kids' commentary, though it completely overtakes the movie so that you really don't hear the movie during the overplay.The Lessons Learned section was moderately okay, and you had a better chance at meeting the young actors. There was a little tongue and cheek by Jack Black, which I had mixed (slightly toward positve) feelings about.I would still reccomend the movie, just on fun.",4,It was a fun movie to watch.,1230768000,"01 1, 2009",2009,2405,"['School', 'Rock', 'billed', 'comedy', 'found', 'more', 'related', 'Shakespearian', 'comedies', 'say', 'recent', 'movie', 'comedy', 'say', 'one', 'died', 'overall', 'had', 'good', 'ending', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'very', 'few', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'movie', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'tough', 'audience', 'was', 'take', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'it.As', 'matter', 'fact', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'something', 'feel', 'good', 'story', 'fun', 'something', 'always', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'story', 'certain', 'number', 'blatant', 'holes', 'such', 'how', 'easy', 'would', 'be', 'be', 'invited', 'prestigious', 'prep', 'school', 'substitute', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'can', 'forgive', 'unlikely', 'plausibility.Central', 'School', 'Rock', 'music', 'mean', 'themes', 'revolve', 'music', 'not', 'music', 'what', 'Rock', 'what', 'protagonist', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'situation', 'basic', 'plot', 'Rock', 'what', 'funk', 'what', 'bit', 'more', 'trouble.The', 'kids', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'fact', 'play', 'so', 'well', 'kids', 'do', 'offer', 'opportunity', 'Dewey', 'change', 'little', 'offer', 'own', 'wisdom', 'help', 'rather', 'convoluted', 'weak', 'issues', 'experience', 'such', 'being', 'cool', 'stage', 'fright', 'pressure', 'peers', 'parents.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'concert', 'end', 'movie', 'concert', 'one', 'see', 'fun', 'rock', 'roll', 'performance', 'conclusion', 'performance.I', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'history', 'rock', 'other', 'just', 'diagram', 'something', 'minor', 'concern.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'light', 'repast', ""n't"", 'very', 'serious', ""n't"", 'over-the-top', 'comedic', 'fun', 'least', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes', 'so', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up.As', 'far', 'extras', 'were', 'okay', 'were', 'deal', 'maker', 'deal', 'breaker.I', 'enjoyed', 'Kids', 'commentary', 'completely', 'movie', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'movie', 'overplay.The', 'Lessons', 'Learned', 'section', 'was', 'moderately', 'okay', 'had', 'better', 'chance', 'meeting', 'young', 'actors', 'was', 'little', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'Jack', 'Black', 'had', 'mixed', 'slightly', 'positve', 'feelings', 'about.I', 'would', 'still', 'reccomend', 'movie', 'just', 'fun']",School of Rock

I don't like Jack Black.Okay, well, maybe I didn't like Jack Black before.  But a friend made me sit down and watch ""School of Rock"" -- which I enjoyed MUCH more than I thought I would -- and maybe I can rethink my opinion now.Jack Black has always been the type of ""comedic actor"" that got on my nerves -- too spastic, too idiotic, about as funny as a tennis ball.  But what's always a nice surprise is finding an actor/comic who, when put in the perfect role (in this case, one written for him), shines like a beacon.Dewey Finn is a lover of true rock music who has just been kicked out of the band he created for his wild antics onstage (aka displaying his mediocre talent so outrageously, it overshadows the rest of the band, making them look bad).  In desperate need of the rent money before his roommate's anal-retentive girlfriend gets him kicked out of the house, Dewey accidentally intercepts a phone call for his substitute-teacher roomie ... and ends up with a teaching job at a private (snooty) grade school where he is completely out of his element.  Simply there to kill time and collect a check, Dewey shows a real interest in his students only when he finds out some of them are musically inclined.  Conning the children into thinking it's a school project, Dewey gets the ""brilliant"" idea of using the kids to form a rock band -- eventually calling themselves The School of Rock -- that he will use in the local Battle of the Bands competition to beat the snot out of his old band.  All he has to do is keep the ""project"" secret from the school's principal, Ms. Mullins (the underrated comic genius that is Joan Cusack), an uptight and by-the-book administrator -- and make sure the kids don't blab to their parents.The scenes of Dewey putting together the band are some of the funniest in the film - the class of ten and eleven-year-olds includes roadies, groupies, back-up singers, an effeminate warddrobe person ... even a band manager.  Dewey's lessons in the history of rock -- and in the playing of rock -- are done by Black with such intensity and over-the-top energy, I spent probably half the film thinking he was going to explode.Does it come together in the end?  Will Dewey's HIGHLY ILLEGAL impersonation of a ceritifed teacher (let alone that it's his roommate) be discovered?  Are the kids any good?  And just what is Ms. Mullins' secret regarding Stevie Nicks?All is revealed in this very funny, highly-entertaining comedy.  Jack Black is perfect in the role of Dewey Finn, a rock and roller who loves to play simply for his passion for music -- a sentiment he manages to inspire in his kids as he teaches them to ""fight the man.""  Joan Cusak leads a supporting cast that includes some very talented kids, in a film that makes you feel good, and may even make you shed a tear or two (without being weepy or overly sentimental).  Worth watching and worth owning on DVD -- even for non-Jack Black fans who may slowly be turning their opinions around (ahem) - ""School of Rock"" does indeed rock ... and if Mr. Black will make more films like this, in my opinion he'll ROCK, too.",4,"See it for 'Turkey Club,' 'Brace-face,' and 'Blondie' alone!",1079827200,"03 21, 2004",2004,3158,"['do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Jack', 'Black', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Jack', 'Black', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Jack', 'Black.Okay', 'well', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Jack', 'Black', 'friend', 'made', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'School', 'Rock', 'enjoyed', 'MUCH', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'maybe', 'can', 'rethink', 'opinion', 'now.Jack', 'Black', 'always', 'been', 'type', 'comedic', 'actor', 'got', 'nerves', 'too', 'spastic', 'too', 'idiotic', 'about', 'as', 'funny', 'tennis', 'ball', 'what', 'always', 'nice', 'surprise', 'finding', 'actor/comic', 'who', 'when', 'put', 'perfect', 'role', 'case', 'one', 'written', 'shines', 'beacon.Dewey', 'Finn', 'lover', 'true', 'rock', 'music', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'kicked', 'band', 'created', 'wild', 'antics', 'onstage', 'displaying', 'mediocre', 'talent', 'so', 'outrageously', 'rest', 'band', 'making', 'look', 'bad', 'desperate', 'need', 'rent', 'money', 'roommate', 'anal-retentive', 'girlfriend', 'kicked', 'house', 'Dewey', 'accidentally', 'phone', 'call', 'substitute-teacher', 'roomie', 'up', 'teaching', 'job', 'private', 'snooty', 'grade', 'school', 'where', 'completely', 'element', 'Simply', 'kill', 'time', 'collect', 'check', 'Dewey', 'real', 'interest', 'students', 'only', 'when', 'out', 'are', 'musically', 'inclined', 'Conning', 'children', 'thinking', 'school', 'project', 'Dewey', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'using', 'kids', 'form', 'rock', 'band', 'eventually', 'calling', 'School', 'Rock', 'will', 'use', 'local', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'competition', 'beat', 'snot', 'old', 'band', 'do', 'keep', 'project', 'secret', 'school', 'principal', 'Ms.', 'Mullins', 'underrated', 'comic', 'genius', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'uptight', 'by-the-book', 'administrator', 'make', 'sure', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'blab', 'parents.The', 'scenes', 'Dewey', 'putting', 'together', 'band', 'are', 'funniest', 'film', 'class', 'ten', 'eleven-year-olds', 'roadies', 'groupies', 'back-up', 'singers', 'effeminate', 'warddrobe', 'person', 'even', 'band', 'manager', 'Dewey', 'lessons', 'history', 'rock', 'playing', 'rock', 'are', 'done', 'Black', 'such', 'intensity', 'over-the-top', 'energy', 'spent', 'probably', 'film', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'explode.Does', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'Will', 'Dewey', 'HIGHLY', 'ILLEGAL', 'impersonation', 'ceritifed', 'teacher', 'let', 'alone', 'roommate', 'be', 'discovered', 'Are', 'kids', 'good', 'just', 'what', 'Ms.', 'Mullins', 'secret', 'regarding', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'revealed', 'very', 'funny', 'highly-entertaining', 'comedy', 'Jack', 'Black', 'perfect', 'role', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'rock', 'roller', 'who', 'play', 'simply', 'passion', 'music', 'sentiment', 'inspire', 'kids', 'fight', 'man', 'Joan', 'Cusak', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'talented', 'kids', 'film', 'feel', 'good', 'may', 'even', 'make', 'shed', 'tear', 'two', 'being', 'weepy', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'Worth', 'watching', 'worth', 'owning', 'DVD', 'even', 'non-Jack', 'Black', 'fans', 'who', 'may', 'slowly', 'be', 'turning', 'opinions', 'ahem', 'School', 'Rock', 'indeed', 'rock', 'Mr.', 'Black', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'films', 'opinion', ""'ll"", 'ROCK', 'too']",School of Rock

Oh, and the jam session during the closing credits was pretty good as well.First off, Jack's character (Dewey) was just unlikable.  There was nothing that had me rooting for the guy.  He was deceitful, greedy, and unloving.  Worst off, he just wasn't all that funny.  There was one scene that actually made me laugh out loud... but I laugh easily so this isn't saying much.  And it is most definitely not a reason to keep handing this guy lead roles.  Supporting cast... yeah, he does great there.  But lead role?  He is not of that caliber.

Both the teacher, the students, the principal and the parents all learn something along the way.The School of Rock is an entertaining film that walks the line between being family friendly and being offensive.  There were three moments during the film where one might wish the editor had cut the line for my younger children.  What will bother some are the mild references to sex and drugs.  But there is no cursing, nudity or simulated sex.  What may bother others is Dewey twins philosophies of Screw the Man and that Anger makes good Rock and Roll.  The kids adopt this philosophy, but Dewey takes responsibility for possibly the first time in his life.But this is a comedy and the whole thing works.  After having sat through the movie, my kids immediately wanted to watch it a second time, and the 11 and 9 year old sat through it a second time.  My 7 year old went off to play.

Looking only to get paid and practice for the coming Battle of the Bands, Black masquerades as a teacher and uses the children to play back up instruments and vocals.

Black and the elementary school kids bond, while learning about themselves and each other between wisecracks.Black just misses greatness in this film because there isn't enough of him.

795675,A39LO2MPCWS4EO,B00018U9FW,Jeffrey C. Zoerner,"[12, 35]","This web site told me I couldn't post this review without assigning it stars.  But I was.  I was trying to assign it zero.The trailers for this movie made it look good for a couple of entertaining hours.  It's not good for even that, or anything else.  You may have seen enjoyed seeing Jack Black host Saturday Night Live or appearing on some talk show.  Beware: this is NOT the Jack Black you'll see in ""School of Rock.""  Here is timing is horrible, his outbursts forced, his physical ""comedy"" lacking, and his delivery extremely unfunny.  What a disapointment.As you know, the movie shows what happens when a hip rockster, played by Black, encounters a group of uptight prep school kids who have never been exposed to the mind-expanding power of rock music.  So Black - the latest model of the old Hollywood staple, the funny, loud, fat guy - tries to set them straight.Don't get me started on the ""acting"" in this movie.  The interaction between adults in this film is just awful (although Joan Cusak is OK).  Poor dialogue and poor acting don't mix. Things are a bit better between Black and the kids are a little better, but mostly because the kids are cute and not because of any actual chemistry.But ultimately it is Jack Black that sinks this film to the bottom of the septic tank.  His character steamrolls his way through the film, thoughtlessly imposing his pitiful world vision on schoolchildren at the expense of their well being.  Instead of coming off as the boorish, out-of-control cretin you can't help but love, he just seems awkward and stupid.  Absolutely horrible.  If the Oscars had an award for Worst Actor, Black would've won it running away.  Has the director of this film ever heard of the phrase ""Cut!  Can we do that one again?""On a deeper level, something about the basic premise of this film really bothers me.  The prep school kids are supposed to be on the straight and narrow path that subordinates one's heart to one's sense of duty.  Black's character is supposed to represent the free spirit who can't be tamed who has come to liberate the kid's minds.  But what is Black really trying to foist upon these repressed, knowledge-hungry kids?  Let's consider.What appalls Black's character about these kids initially is not their ignorance of rock, but rather of ""classic rock.""  (A bumper sticker idea: CLASSIC ROCK IS NEITHER)  The film suggests that kids who aren't listening to music that came out 25 years before they were born are square, repressed, and unhappy.  Wow!  For better or worse, kids listen to Eminem and Blink 182 and 50 Cent and so on.  There's a word for kids that listen to the same music their grandparents did: NERDS.  Think of it.  I'm 40, so that means when I was a kid I listened to Elton John, The Eagles, Heart, The Temptations, and whatever else they played on the radio.  If some dude came to my class and started lambasting us because we weren't hip to Peggy Lee, the Mills Brothers, Frank Sinatra, Vic Damone and so on, we would've laughed him out of the room.  And rightfully so!  This horrible film, which tries to pass itself off as radical, is actually about as reactionary as you can get.Lest you think my assessment represents some spiteful vendetta against this movie, let me say that the group of friends I saw this movie with all though the same thing. Count this with Mel Gibson's ""Signs"" as one of the most incomprably bad movies you're likely to see.To summarize: It would be one thing to make a film with the theme of ""Let the kids be kids.""  The theme of this film is ""Force the kids be like a 30-year-old burnout who can't stop living in the past.""  That is probably the opposite of what everyone who sees this movie expects.  And they should, because that just sucks.  And so does the movie.",1,Movies just don't get any worse,1080345600,"03 27, 2004",2004,3773,"['web', 'site', 'told', 'could', ""n't"", 'post', 'review', 'assigning', 'was', 'was', 'trying', 'assign', 'zero.The', 'trailers', 'movie', 'made', 'look', 'good', 'couple', 'entertaining', 'hours', 'not', 'good', 'even', 'anything', 'else', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Jack', 'Black', 'host', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'appearing', 'talk', 'show', 'Beware', 'NOT', 'Jack', 'Black', ""'ll"", 'see', 'School', 'Rock', 'Here', 'timing', 'horrible', 'outbursts', 'forced', 'physical', 'comedy', 'lacking', 'delivery', 'extremely', 'unfunny', 'What', 'disapointment.As', 'know', 'movie', 'what', 'when', 'hip', 'rockster', 'played', 'Black', 'group', 'uptight', 'prep', 'school', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'exposed', 'mind-expanding', 'power', 'rock', 'music', 'So', 'Black', 'latest', 'model', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'staple', 'funny', 'loud', 'fat', 'guy', 'tries', 'set', 'straight.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'acting', 'movie', 'interaction', 'adults', 'film', 'just', 'awful', 'Joan', 'Cusak', 'OK', 'Poor', 'dialogue', 'poor', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'mix', 'Things', 'are', 'bit', 'better', 'Black', 'kids', 'are', 'little', 'better', 'mostly', 'kids', 'are', 'cute', 'not', 'actual', 'chemistry.But', 'ultimately', 'Jack', 'Black', 'film', 'bottom', 'septic', 'tank', 'character', 'way', 'film', 'thoughtlessly', 'imposing', 'pitiful', 'world', 'vision', 'schoolchildren', 'expense', 'well', 'being', 'Instead', 'coming', 'off', 'boorish', 'out-of-control', 'cretin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'just', 'awkward', 'stupid', 'Absolutely', 'horrible', 'Oscars', 'had', 'award', 'Worst', 'Actor', 'Black', 'would', ""'ve"", 'won', 'running', 'away', 'director', 'film', 'ever', 'heard', 'phrase', 'Cut', 'Can', 'do', 'one', 'again', 'deeper', 'level', 'something', 'basic', 'premise', 'film', 'really', 'bothers', 'prep', 'school', 'kids', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'straight', 'narrow', 'path', 'one', 'heart', 'one', 'sense', 'duty', 'Black', 'character', 'supposed', 'represent', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'tamed', 'who', 'come', 'liberate', 'kid', 'minds', 'what', 'Black', 'really', 'trying', 'foist', 'repressed', 'knowledge-hungry', 'kids', 'Let', 'consider.What', 'Black', 'character', 'kids', 'initially', 'not', 'ignorance', 'rock', 'rather', 'classic', 'rock', 'bumper', 'sticker', 'idea', 'CLASSIC', 'ROCK', 'IS', 'NEITHER', 'film', 'kids', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'listening', 'music', 'came', 'out', '25', 'years', 'were', 'born', 'are', 'square', 'repressed', 'unhappy', 'Wow', 'better', 'worse', 'kids', 'listen', 'Eminem', 'Blink', '182', '50', 'Cent', 'so', 'word', 'kids', 'listen', 'same', 'music', 'grandparents', 'did', 'NERDS', 'Think', ""'m"", '40', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'listened', 'Elton', 'John', 'Eagles', 'Heart', 'Temptations', 'else', 'played', 'radio', 'dude', 'came', 'class', 'started', 'lambasting', 'were', ""n't"", 'hip', 'Peggy', 'Lee', 'Mills', 'Brothers', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Vic', 'Damone', 'so', 'would', ""'ve"", 'laughed', 'room', 'rightfully', 'so', 'horrible', 'film', 'pass', 'off', 'as', 'radical', 'actually', 'about', 'as', 'reactionary', 'can', 'get.Lest', 'think', 'assessment', 'spiteful', 'vendetta', 'movie', 'let', 'say', 'group', 'friends', 'saw', 'movie', 'same', 'thing', 'Count', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Signs', 'one', 'most', 'incomprably', 'bad', 'movies', ""'re"", 'likely', 'see.To', 'summarize', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'make', 'film', 'theme', 'Let', 'kids', 'be', 'kids', 'theme', 'film', 'Force', 'kids', 'be', '30-year-old', 'burnout', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'living', 'past', 'probably', 'opposite', 'what', 'everyone', 'who', 'movie', 'should', 'just', 'sucks', 'so', 'movie']",School of Rock

Why Black wasn't nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor is a mystery. His performance is phenomenal. I've never seen anything like it. He completely holds your attention, even when he's in the background and what makes him so extraordinary is that his performance is so damned fresh! Some of the ads described him as &quot;Gonzo&quot; comedian but he's much more than that. As the substitute teacher who teaches his bright kids about the history and the love of rock and roll, he conveys a genuine sweetness and tenderness that startles. I watched this movie twice, back-to-back, and will definitely buy it for my permanent DVD library. The down side is that aren't any roles out there for such a wondrous, free-spirited genius like Jack Black. God forbid they do the inevitable sequel. This movie worked on every level and although we know the outcome from the very beginning, it was fascinating to travel that path before The End appeared.

Because I was expecting this movie to really be funny and entertaining, and my wife and I thought for sure this would be a DVD to buy. So we popped the DVD in, we were in a good mood, we just KNEW this movie was going to be funny. So what went wrong? I like Jack Black usually. But maybe it's because he's only good in small doses. Comedy is a matter of balance and timing, and Jack Black pours on his raging exaggerated characteristics to the hilt ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE MOVIE! I don't even know if I can blame Black for this. The director should have known better. &quot;Dude, let's do that scene again, but tone it down a bit. You're coming off like a madman on crack.&quot; Maybe the director was too scared to hold him back. Still, what's worse is the writing and the silly message the movie tries to get across. I don't even have kids, but if I did, a guy pretending to be a teacher and taking my kids off on &quot;field trips,&quot; and teaching them disrespect - well, let's just say that even though I knew this was &quot;only&quot; a fantasy movie, I couldn't stop thinking how crazy and unrealistic this would be in &quot;real life.&quot; But yeah, since this is a movie, all ties up neatly in the end and everyone is happy that this crazy rock obsessed madman took the kids without permission in his van to perform &quot;rock&quot; concerts.

795688,A1LPTWPNBPZWJP,B00018U9FW,Kaan Vural,"[0, 0]","Well, not literally. But for the last decade, if I'd been watching a comedy, chances are it was this.Jack Black is not to everyone's taste, and I can understand that. I'm personally a big fan, though I acknowledge that he works best in certain films. But Black's clear love for rock and roll shines through the whole time.Had this film been more poorly written, I would have complained about how creepy it is that Black's character - Dewey Finn - was exploiting these kids. But thankfully, both the film and its main character are aware of the irresponsibility of what's going on. Knowing that this something that can't last is a big part of the emotional investment as you're waiting for the house of cards to come tumbling down on Dewey and the kids.This film was my introduction to rock and, yes, it's no college primer, but looking back the film has all sorts of little references, some of which might miss even moderate rock fans, that clearly mark the energy that went into the film.One thing I loved was about how there is basically no villain in the movie. The kids are unmotivated, but talented and creative; the principal is a stickler for rules, but secretly yearns to break free of them; even Finn's nemesis, played by Sarah Silverman, is perfectly in the right to treat Finn with contempt. I loved that the film fights the idea of establishment more than it does the people within it; both the principal and the parents come to see the students in a new light, rather than being ""punished"".The other thing I loved was how none of the characters become ""famous"" in the end, which is something else a more poorly written film would have done. The kids and Dewey feel rewarded just for having discovered their own passions and talents - and for all the emotion they give it at the end, you'd be convinced that they won a million dollars.It would be disingenuous of me to claim that this is either the funniest comedy or the most cerebral, but it's certainly one of the most enthusiastic. Everyone feels like they're having a wonderful time, and I couldn't help but be dragged along by it.

Bernabo,"[5, 6]","I really had heightened expectations for &quot;School of Rock,&quot; because I tend to really like movies where people find an excuse to get up and play songs.  Besides, there was such good word of mouth on this film as well and I liked Jack Black's performance at the end of &quot;Shallow Hall.&quot;  This time around Black plays Dewey Finn, who has been kicked out of the rock band he created because he tends to confuse his commitment to the power of rock 'n' roll with the gratification of his own ego.  He cons his way into a gig as a substitute teacher for a fifth-grade class at a private school and as soon as he finds out some of these kids can actually play instruments he start turning them into a rock band.  The goal is to go head-to-head with his old group and beat them into the ground at the upcoming Battle of the Bands.  He also gives his cherubs an education in rock, mainly because he is so appalled at their lack of knowledge.Granted, there is a certain predictability to the plot here, but &quot;School of Rock&quot; does not fall into a similar trap with the characters.  Dewey does not get changed in the process as much as have his eyes opened to what is happening when you really collaborate in creating music and playing in a band.  In simpler terms, he starts practicing what he has been preaching.  As for the kids, they follow their rock 'n' roll Pied Piper's lead but they also are more than willing to stand up and get in Dewey's face.I actually wanted more of a rock education for the viewing audience.  There is a nice little scene where Dewey has laid out a constellation chart of rock groups on the board, but instead of hearing him lecture we get the music on the soundtrack turned up loud.  Old viewers will of course recognize the names that Dewey drops throughout the film, but I kept thinking it would be nice if there were a few choice instances where Dewey drove home a couple of key points to the kidlets.  In other words, do with words what is done with music when Dewey teaches the kid who plays guitar the riffs for &quot;Sunshine Of Your Love,&quot; &quot;Iron Man,&quot; and &quot;Smoke on the Water,&quot; or the keyboard player the opening of &quot;Touch Me.&quot;You can guess what is happening at the end, but that does not take away from the overall sense of fun, especially for younger viewers who will enjoy the fact the kids are all doing their own singing and playing.  I have just been comparing such musical grand finales to the end of &quot;Uptown Girls,&quot; and I find this one to be okay (the song was not up to the kids).  There are some efforts to take advantage of Joan Cusack playing the head of the school, but she really is underutilized (I was expecting more off of the Stevie Nicks reference).  These things just underscore not only that &quot;School of Rock&quot; could have been better but that we really would have liked this 2003 film to have made it all the way to the next level.",4,Jack Black as the demented Pied Piper of Rock 'n' Roll,1078790400,"03 9, 2004",2004,2959,"['really', 'had', 'heightened', 'expectations', 'quot', 'School', 'Rock', 'quot', 'tend', 'really', 'like', 'movies', 'where', 'people', 'find', 'excuse', 'get', 'up', 'play', 'songs', 'was', 'such', 'good', 'word', 'mouth', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'liked', 'Jack', 'Black', 'performance', 'end', 'quot', 'Shallow', 'Hall.', 'quot', 'time', 'around', 'Black', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'who', 'been', 'kicked', 'rock', 'band', 'created', 'confuse', 'commitment', 'power', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'gratification', 'own', 'ego', 'way', 'gig', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'fifth-grade', 'class', 'private', 'school', 'as', 'soon', 'out', 'kids', 'can', 'actually', 'play', 'instruments', 'start', 'turning', 'rock', 'band', 'goal', 'go', 'head-to-head', 'old', 'group', 'beat', 'ground', 'upcoming', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'also', 'cherubs', 'education', 'rock', 'mainly', 'so', 'appalled', 'lack', 'knowledge.Granted', 'certain', 'predictability', 'plot', 'here', 'quot', 'School', 'Rock', 'quot', 'not', 'fall', 'similar', 'trap', 'characters', 'Dewey', 'not', 'get', 'changed', 'process', 'as', 'much', 'have', 'eyes', 'opened', 'what', 'happening', 'when', 'really', 'collaborate', 'creating', 'music', 'playing', 'band', 'simpler', 'terms', 'practicing', 'what', 'been', 'preaching', 'kids', 'follow', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'lead', 'also', 'are', 'more', 'willing', 'stand', 'up', 'get', 'Dewey', 'face.I', 'actually', 'wanted', 'more', 'rock', 'education', 'viewing', 'audience', 'nice', 'little', 'scene', 'where', 'Dewey', 'laid', 'out', 'constellation', 'chart', 'rock', 'groups', 'board', 'instead', 'hearing', 'lecture', 'get', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'turned', 'up', 'loud', 'Old', 'viewers', 'will', 'course', 'recognize', 'names', 'Dewey', 'film', 'kept', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'were', 'few', 'choice', 'instances', 'where', 'Dewey', 'drove', 'home', 'couple', 'key', 'points', 'kidlets', 'other', 'words', 'do', 'words', 'what', 'done', 'music', 'when', 'Dewey', 'kid', 'who', 'guitar', 'riffs', 'quot', 'Sunshine', 'Your', 'Love', 'quot', 'quot', 'Iron', 'Man', 'quot', 'quot', 'Smoke', 'Water', 'quot', 'keyboard', 'player', 'opening', 'quot', 'Touch', 'Me.', 'quot', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'happening', 'end', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'sense', 'fun', 'especially', 'younger', 'viewers', 'who', 'will', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'kids', 'are', 'doing', 'own', 'singing', 'playing', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'comparing', 'such', 'musical', 'grand', 'finales', 'end', 'quot', 'Uptown', 'Girls', 'quot', 'find', 'one', 'be', 'okay', 'song', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'kids', 'are', 'efforts', 'take', 'advantage', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'playing', 'head', 'school', 'really', 'underutilized', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'reference', 'things', 'just', 'underscore', 'not', 'only', 'quot', 'School', 'Rock', 'quot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'liked', '2003', 'film', 'have', 'made', 'way', 'next', 'level']",School of Rock

(Hey, at least they're praying, right?)What works about this movie is Jack Black.  There is something demented about him that fits his lead role perfectly.  You get the sense that he's whacked in real life, and while he might not try to turn prep schoolers into rock stars, he just weird enough to make it possible.  But he is also part of what is wrong with the movie (a small part, but still ...).  There are moments where he just makes you want to cringe from all his weirdness, like when he sings a song he wrote to the class.  It goes on way too long and is, well, creepy.  Not good weird, but sad weird.  Because like his character in High Fidelity (a much better performance, I think, in a much better movie), Jack comes across like a guy who is, deep down, a sad, alienated loser; a guy who sits in a subway doing word search puzzles--maybe homeless, certainly dateless, and maybe a bit cranky.  And smart.As for the rest of the film, the child actors are okay.  Nothing to write home about, but at least they're not cringeworthy.  The rest of the cast basically mails it in, but that's okay since Jack is a one man army.  So raise your goblet of rock and see this thing; you'll be mildly amused.

795704,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B00018U9FW,Mary Whipple,"[2, 3]","Playing to every music-loving ten-year-old's fantasies, this Richard Linklater film pokes fun at school administrators, pushy parents, kids forced into adult molds too soon, an educational establishment which allows little room for fun in the classroom, and a kid's desire to live a life that's secret from his parents. Great fun to watch and often very funny, the film is full of clich&eacute;s and stereotyped characters, but that's why it works so well for kids--they can see aspects of themselves in several characters, recognize their own insecurities, but see that life is fun.Dewey Finn (Jack Black), a manic rock-and-roll wannabe who has lost his job, intercepts a phone call to his roommate, Ned Schneebly (Mike White), about a substitute teaching job at an elite urban prep school and, desperately needing cash, takes the job teaching uptight fifth graders with highly motivated parents.  Pretending to be Ned and ostensibly teaching the fifth grade core curriculum, he quickly discovers the musical talents of his students, most of whom have been studying serious classical music.  Believing they need to be loosened up, he abandons the curriculum and turns his class into a school of rock, hiding his efforts from the principal (neurotically played by Joan Cusack), and spiriting the class off to a Battle of the Bands contest without the permission of the students' parents or the school administration.Black is off-the-wall with his manic energy, his mugging, and his free-wheeling heavy-metal style, and his good intentions are so obvious from the outset, that even adult viewers, firmly grounded in reality, get caught up in the fun.  The kids are terrific as they break out of the molds into which they have been forced by their parents and school and, of course, they become better human beings in the process.  Black is so outrageous--and so completely himself--that even the youngest viewer will see him as larger than life.Written by Mike White, who plays the ""real"" Ned Schneebly in the film, the film offers Jack Black a chance to dominate the film and have fun both with his music and his mugging.  The original music by Jack Black and Mike White, especially the songs like ""Math is a Wonderful thing,"" created on the ""spur of the moment,"" are hilarious, and the demonstration of how a rock song evolves is amusing to watch.  Good, clean fun for the middle school set, parents, and grandparents, this is a film which appeals to that awkward age between childhood innocence and adolescence without being saccharine and condescending.

Jack Black is the man in the movie and he finally gets to be himself.Dewey Finn(Black) is a poor rocker. He freeloads off his good friend Ned(White). Dewey has no job and he constantly hears about it from Neds girlfriend Patty(Silverman). Dewey teases Ned about his job as a substitute teacher and it really angers Patty. She makes Ned give Dewey in ultimatum in that he must pay his share of rent by the end of the week or he's gone.Dewey is desperate, so when a prep school calls the house looking for Ned to work there for a couple of weeks, Dewey sees a chance for a job and he takes it. Dewey arrives to the school and pretends to be Ned. He gets to his class full of 10 year olds and quickly hates them. He doesn't make them do anything and the kids hate him too. Principal Mullins(Cusack) is suspicious of the behavior, but doesn't do anything. In his second to third day into the job Dewey finds out the kids have music class. He hears there music down the hall and goes to investigate. He goes to the class and what he finds is a bunch of great young musicians. He has an idea, he can use them to win Battle of the Bands.The winner of Battle of the Bands receives a 20,000 prize and Dewey is no longer in a band. When the kids come back to class he has rock instruments waiting for them. He assigns a couple of kids to play keyboard, guitar, bass, and drums. He then gets back up singers from more kids in the class. He's then giving kids assignments from groupies, stage crew, and security until everybody in the class has some kind of assignment. Not it's up to Dewey to see if he can educate these kids on rock and roll, not get caught, and to see if he can actually pull this off.Jack Black is the absolute man in this movie. For those of you who don't know Black is in the crude humor band Tenacious D and they are fantastic. His character is similar to himself in real life and that's why he does so good. He has an amazing rock n roll voice and watching him teach these kids rock is great. This is the best movie Black has made to date and that because of a well written script and he gets to act like himself. He's a quite of funny guy and his fans should be well pleased with his role in this movie.All the kids in the movie are great. The kids who play the instuments are real musicians and can play in real life what they play in the movie. You can tell all the kids loved working with Black by the enthusiasm they all show on screen. Movies with kids don't work if they can't connect with the adult star and that isn't the case in this movie. Black said in all his interviews how much fun he had working with them and the joy is displayed on screen. It really is fun watching them.The music is School of Rock is great. All the original songs were written by Black and once again we get to see the talents of this rocker. There are a ton of classic rock songs in the movie and you have to laugh watching these kids play these classic tunes. The theme song to School of Rock is the best song in the movie. It really did get slammed by not getting an Oscar nomination. I heard one critic say they dont' nominate rock songs. That's balderdash because the year before Eminem won with Lose Yourself. School of Rock is a fantastic song that is my best song from a motion picture in 2003.This is a feel good movie. It's Blacks best work to date. This is a comedy you can sit down and watch with the whole family.

References abound to Yes, Rush, Led Zeppelin, even Iron Maiden abound in this movie. Jack Black is hilarious as a burned out early 30 something rocker turned substitute teacher, and his usual mannerisms and inflections are used to humorous effect.The film is inspiring, funny, even a bit ""cute"" in a family film sort of way.

And along the way the slob cleans himself up and the kids get solid life-lessons as the slob realizes he was born to be a role-model, right?Not even close! &quot;School of Rock&quot; isn't some formula cookie-cutter movie. It slamdances around every potential pitfall and triumphs. &quot;School of Rock&quot; is one of the few movies that kids and adults will both love, sometimes even for the same reasons.Why is &quot;School of Rock&quot; so cool? Let me count the ways...1. Jack Black is turned loose, and who knew? He's a natural with kids. He never once dumbs down his persona - instead, if anything, he cranks it up a notch, and proves he can be endearingly obnoxious without being cloying, which is a rare gift.2. Jack, and the movie, takes rock music seriously. Dewey Finn, Jack's character, talks about rock as if it's a vital component of his soul. By the end of the movie, you'll agree.3. The kids aren't trapped into Disney formulas - they're real kids, with dimensions and a certain wisdom. They also take the music seriously.4.

Jack Black charges into this role as if it were the most important role of his life...and although not a Black fan, one must give credit to the man for his enormous energy and spirit in playing the role of Dewey Finn.  Forgetting he's in a new century, Finn plays his guitar like a madman, copying all the great guitarists of the 70s and 80s.  Of course, an anachronism, his current band decides he's hurting them so they fire him.  Black meanwhile is mooching off his friend Ned Schneebly (the Opie-ish Mike White), and White's girlfriend (Sarah Silverman) wants Dewey out.  Dewey of course is one of those guys who wouldn't know a day's work if it fell on him.  Irresponsible, lazy, self-centered, just what you like in a rock and roller.  Anyway, Black intercepts a phone call meant for his buddy and ends up getting a substitute teaching job at a snooty prep school.  The principal is played by the immensely talented Joan Cusack and she is perfect in the part.  One doesn't get the impression she's acting at all.  (This role was Oscar worthy in the supporting category).  Of course, Jack ends up turning his class into a rock and roll band, along with groupies, managers, lights, etc.  He wants them to be his band in the big contest his former band thinks they will win.  The children, every one of them, are simply fantastic and are the true heart of the movie, along with Jack's fierce love of rock and roll.  Miranda Cosgrove, who plays the precocious Summer, is truly gifted, as are the young men who play Lawrence, Zack, Freddie and the one who wants to be a fashion designer.

795716,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00018U9FW,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","School of Rock is one of those films that's tailor-made for the comedian performing in it.  This has become all the rage since Robin Williams played the Genie in Aladdin, Jim Carey in The Mask, or Will Ferrell in Elf.  These sorts of films play to the comedian's strengths and minimize their weaknesses, and when they get it right, it's movie magic.And so Black gets his moment in School of Rock.  Black's been playing the overweight guy pining for the good old days of rock like geeks pine over the original Star Trek series, with pop-eyed enthusiasm far outweighing the energy that most people muster for just about anything.  Black is truly the uber-music geek and the title is well earned through a film history of Black essentially playing the same guy: Bio-Dome (as Tenacious D), High Fidelity (as Barry), Shallow Hal (as Hal), and of course Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny. In short, if there's going to be a film about kids learning about the pedigree of rock and roll, Black would be the guy who wrote, directed, and acted in it.What's surprising is that this movie ISN'T Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny.  As a music geek, Black's tastes for music could easily alienate much of the audience.  School of Rock isn't just about rock; it's about music appreciation, the lack of attention paid to kids in school, teacher malaise, and a society that no longer fights the Man.  Or to put it another way, this is a movie made for the mainstream.Which is what makes it so much fun.  Our slacker hero, Dewey Finn (Jack Black), has been crashing at his substitute teacher friend's house (Ned, played by Mike White).  When Ned's girlfriend (the lovely Sarah Silverman, playing a decidedly unfunny role) pushes for Dewey's ouster, the slob has to get a job.  And so he does, by impersonating Ned at a private school for upper class kids. It's not long before Dewey throws out the curriculum and teaches the kids his own brand of history: good old, wholesome rock and roll.School of Rock spends a lot of time struggling to justify the madness: the kids soundproof the room, teachers occasionally think they hear something, the uptight principal springs surprise visits (played by the delightfully naughty Joan Cusack), and parents start to get worried.  Just about none of it is believable, most specifically when Dewey is finally caught by the police and ends up dashing down the hallway, two guitars in hand, without any further consequences.But that's beside the point.  Who cares if School of Rock bends the laws of time and space to allow Dewey's one chance in the sun, not as a rock star but as the aging patriarch of a band of insanely talented pre-teens?  We came to see a rock show, and we get it.Black flops around, he sweats, he tosses his head with manic glee, but most of all he passionately TEACHES.  He teaches a large girl that her weight doesn't matter, teaches the geek that he should ignore the kids who make fun of him, teaches the brat some discipline, and encourages the brilliance of the lead queen bee to use her powers for good instead of evil.  He makes a difference with the kids by bringing what he knows best to the room; not school learning, but plain old-fashioned street smarts.  Dewey's, and by extension Black's, sheer enthusiasm makes up for his rough edges.If only teachers were this enthusiastic about anything these days!",4,In the Black,1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,3360,"['School', 'Rock', 'one', 'films', 'tailor-made', 'comedian', 'performing', 'become', 'rage', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'played', 'Genie', 'Aladdin', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'Mask', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Elf', 'sorts', 'films', 'play', 'comedian', 'strengths', 'minimize', 'weaknesses', 'when', 'get', 'right', 'movie', 'magic.And', 'so', 'Black', 'moment', 'School', 'Rock', 'Black', 'been', 'playing', 'overweight', 'guy', 'pining', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'rock', 'geeks', 'pine', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'pop-eyed', 'enthusiasm', 'far', 'outweighing', 'energy', 'most', 'people', 'muster', 'just', 'anything', 'Black', 'truly', 'uber-music', 'geek', 'title', 'well', 'earned', 'film', 'history', 'Black', 'essentially', 'playing', 'same', 'guy', 'Bio-Dome', 'Tenacious', 'D', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'Barry', 'Shallow', 'Hal', 'Hal', 'course', 'Tenacious', 'D', 'Pick', 'Destiny', 'short', 'going', 'be', 'film', 'kids', 'learning', 'pedigree', 'rock', 'roll', 'Black', 'would', 'be', 'guy', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'acted', 'it.What', 'surprising', 'movie', ""N'T"", 'Tenacious', 'D', 'Pick', 'Destiny', 'music', 'geek', 'Black', 'tastes', 'music', 'could', 'easily', 'alienate', 'much', 'audience', 'School', 'Rock', ""n't"", 'just', 'rock', 'music', 'appreciation', 'lack', 'attention', 'paid', 'kids', 'school', 'teacher', 'malaise', 'society', 'longer', 'Man', 'put', 'way', 'movie', 'made', 'mainstream.Which', 'what', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'slacker', 'hero', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'Jack', 'Black', 'been', 'crashing', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'friend', 'house', 'Ned', 'played', 'Mike', 'White', 'When', 'Ned', 'girlfriend', 'lovely', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'playing', 'decidedly', 'unfunny', 'role', 'Dewey', 'ouster', 'slob', 'get', 'job', 'so', 'impersonating', 'Ned', 'private', 'school', 'upper', 'class', 'kids', 'not', 'long', 'before', 'Dewey', 'out', 'curriculum', 'kids', 'own', 'brand', 'history', 'good', 'old', 'wholesome', 'rock', 'roll.School', 'Rock', 'lot', 'time', 'struggling', 'justify', 'madness', 'kids', 'soundproof', 'room', 'teachers', 'occasionally', 'think', 'hear', 'something', 'uptight', 'principal', 'springs', 'surprise', 'visits', 'played', 'delightfully', 'naughty', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'parents', 'start', 'get', 'worried', 'Just', 'none', 'believable', 'most', 'specifically', 'when', 'Dewey', 'finally', 'caught', 'police', 'up', 'dashing', 'down', 'hallway', 'two', 'guitars', 'hand', 'further', 'consequences.But', 'point', 'Who', 'School', 'Rock', 'laws', 'time', 'space', 'allow', 'Dewey', 'one', 'chance', 'sun', 'not', 'rock', 'star', 'aging', 'patriarch', 'band', 'insanely', 'talented', 'pre-teens', 'came', 'see', 'rock', 'show', 'get', 'it.Black', 'flops', 'head', 'manic', 'glee', 'most', 'passionately', 'TEACHES', 'large', 'girl', 'weight', ""n't"", 'matter', 'geek', 'should', 'ignore', 'kids', 'who', 'make', 'fun', 'brat', 'discipline', 'brilliance', 'lead', 'queen', 'bee', 'use', 'powers', 'good', 'instead', 'evil', 'difference', 'kids', 'bringing', 'what', 'best', 'room', 'not', 'school', 'learning', 'plain', 'old-fashioned', 'street', 'smarts', 'Dewey', 'extension', 'Black', 'sheer', 'enthusiasm', 'up', 'rough', 'edges.If', 'only', 'teachers', 'were', 'enthusiastic', 'anything', 'days']",School of Rock

795718,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00018U9FW,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[1, 2]","It is just absolutely amazing to see how suddenly Jack Black has emerged into the public eye despite a relatively lengthy career in films. It was his hysterical performance opposite Colin Hanks, Tom Hank's son, in Orange County that brought him fully into the mainstream spectrum but amazingly his feature film hasn't been confined to the comedy genre. Since his first appearance on screen in 1992, Black has appeared in such solemn features such as Waterworld, Dead Man Walking, and Enemy of the State. Hollywood soon became aware of the inspiring comedian when starred in the Farrelly Brothers comedy, Shallow Hal, and then the irreverent comedy, Saving Silverman. Now Jack Black's future is bigger and better then ever before with superior roles in three films in 2004: Envy, Shark Tale, and Anchorman. Not only that but Black's metal parody band, Tenacious D, has the potential to be another successful vehicle for the rising star, as his leading role in The School of Rock shows he has the enthusiasm and the look of a real rocker.The story follows an out of work rocker who takes a substitute teacher position at a preppy grade school to get back at his former band members who dumped him from the band. Dewey Finn knows everything there is to know about the history of rock n' roll. He knows every band, every instrument, and every chord ... Rock n' roll is in his blood. The only thing he doesn't know is when to act mature. During a major band performance, Dewey goes off on a twenty guitar solo and acts in a way that not only embarrasses the band but himself as well. Dewey's fellow band members are fed up and, without any other choice, decide to vote him out of the band. With the pressure of his buddy's girlfriend to pay his share of the rent, the fledgling rocker impersonates a substitute teacher and takes a position at an uptight private school. Upon discovering the musical talents of the fourth graders he is placed to educate, Dewey decides to enter the group into a battle of the bands contest that pits the youngsters against his former band mates. Through his senseless antics and irreverent attitude, the children soon learn to break out of their shells and be who they want to be. The story for the School of Rock is decently played out but for the most part the plot is pretty predictable which takes away some of the emotional feelings you might have for the situation and/or the characters. In a film that preaches the message of breaking away from the conventional, School of Rock contradicts itself pretty easily.The cast is pretty minuscule but that doesn't matter too much as the feature relies solely on the energetic performance of Jack Black, which is all that truly matters for this film. If you are not a fan of the work of Jack Black then you are going to have a hard time tolerating this film but even if you are non-partisan in the matter, you aren't exactly going to be rolling in the aisles laughing either. It's not that Black's performance isn't funny, it is, in parts, but for the most part his crazy antics come off as being more annoying then anything else. Joan Cusack is greatly under used in this film and it was rather disappointing to see the filmmakers not exploring the relationship more between her character and Black's.Overall, The School of Rock reforms the school of thought on the conventional family film but not so much so that it will spark a new trend in Hollywood. It's not that the feature isn't entertaining, it is. The problem is that it is nothing more then that. The feeling this film leaves you with is hard to describe, so here's the best way one can put it: If you are at a buddy's house for a night with your best friends and the School of Rock is the film of choice, you won't exactly try to weasel everyone out of watching it but you wouldn't exactly be jumping for joy either. Despite a decent performance from Black, delightful performances from the children, and a rockin' song selection, the entire feature film, in the end, just feels flat. The message of the film also seems a bit lost as it preaches a break away from the conventional but at the same advocates children to fight against ""the man"" or authority, which is definitely a wrong message to send to the young children of America. There are enough problems out there with children disrespecting their parents, school administrators, etc. without this film sermonizing the message of deviance of authority. This may not be the exact way the filmmakers may have intended but it does come off that way. Bottom-line is that School of Rock will do as an entertaining diversion but nothing you essentially need to see before more worthy features like Lost in Translation or Matchstick Men.",4,The Moose Hole - 'School' Rocks ...

795720,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00018U9FW,Miles D. Moore,"[1, 2]","Ever since ""High Fidelity,"" it was apparent that Jack Black was a superstar in the making. With ""School of Rock,"" his stretch limo has officially pulled up to the Beverly Hills Hotel. Combining John Belushi's squat body and manic energy with Jack Nicholson's hyperkinetic eyebrows and Dennis Quaid's diabolical grin, Black can get more genuine laughs just entering a room than Adam Sandler can with a movie full of toilet jokes. ""School of Rock""--directed by Richard Linklater from a script by Black's friend and co-star Mike White--is a star vehicle for Black, and while it's no masterpiece, it does display Black's talents to maximum advantage. Black plays Dewey Finn, a down-and-out rock guitarist who cons his way into a substitute teaching job as a way to earn some badly needed dough. His overachieving young charges--almost all of whom are musically talented--he sees as a way to get himself back into the rock world, and in the process of turning them into a rock band he and they learn some wholesome lessons about teamwork, friendship and the need to keep believing in your dreams. Black's fast-talking, cannonballing charisma underlines the genuine sweetness of the tale while effectively undercutting the potential saccharine content. White--who plays Black's nerdy roommate--contributes a script that expertly combines kid-friendly situations with tart adult wit. There is also excellent support from Joan Cusack, as the school's anal-retentive principal with a secret passion for Stevie Nicks, and from a classroom full of gifted young musicians (especially Maryam Hassan, a pint-sized Aretha Franklin). The audience at the screening I attended--ranging in age from prepubescent to late middle age--roared with laughter.

795721,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00018U9FW,mirasreviews,"[0, 0]","Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a rock guitarist  who has recently been fired by his band. Desperate for cash, he poses as a substitute teacher at a prestigious prep school. But Dewey doesn't know the first thing about teaching, so he's at a loss for anything academic to do. When he learns that many of his 5th-grade students are accomplished musicians, he decides to give these straight-laced kids a lesson in rock-n-roll. He turns the class into a rock band, complete with road crew, a security detail, and groupies. The whole class pitches in to get the band in shape to compete in the city's Battle of the Bands.&quot;School of Rock&quot; was directed by Richard Linklater and written by Mike White, who also plays Dewey's roommate Ned in the film. This movie is just a lot of fun. It was tailor-made for Jack Black, so it perfectly exploits his over-the-top sense of humor and physical comedy. &quot;School of Rock&quot; manages to pay tribute to rock-n-roll while making fun of its more histrionic and self-indulgent clich&eacute;s. It's all in good fun, though. Jack Black is funny and lovable as a reckless rocker who has unwittingly taken on considerable responsibility. Joan Cusack contributes one of her many memorable comedic performances as the uptight principal of the school, Miss Mullins. The child actors who play musicians were themselves chosen for their musical talent. Thankfully the film doesn't fake the kids playing the instruments. They are all accomplished musicians, and it's nice to see so much young talent on the screen. Young members of the audience will be encouraged to see that real kids can rock too. &quot;School of Rock&quot; is a lot of silly fun -but in a good way. It's a movie that both children and adults can enjoy. (By the way, in most parts of the world, this film got a G or PG rating.)The DVD: This is a nicely loaded disc. Bonus features include a making-of documentary called &quot;Lessons Learned&quot;, &quot;Jack Black's Pitch to Led Zeppelin&quot; is which he begs the band for permission to use the &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; in the movie, a music video for the film's theme song, &quot;Kid's Video Diary: Toronto Film Festival&quot;, &quot;MTV's Diary of Jack Black&quot;, a DVD-ROM (Windows only) that contains Dewey's History of Rock and an archive of the film's website, 2 audio commentaries, and a theatrical trailer. &quot;Lessons Learned&quot; is a decent documentary, and it features interviews with Jack Black, Mike White, Richard Linklater, and some of the kids. Jack Black fans will like &quot;MTV's Diary of Jack Black&quot;, which spends one day in L.A. with the actor as he goes to rehearsals for the movie and works on new material for Tenacious D. One of the audio commentaries features Jack Black and Richard Linklater. It's entertaining, but there isn't much technical stuff if that 's what you're looking for. The other audio commentary features 7 of the child actors. It's chaotic, but it's interesting to hear the kids' point of view. One of the funniest things is that they've memorized all the punch lines from the movie. If you're interested in the kids, also check out the &quot;Kids Video Diary: Toronto Film Festival&quot;, which follows the principal child actors for about 12 hours on the day of the film's screening at the Film Festival.

It's a fairly standard &quot;beloved teacher&quot; film...the kind with the outsider teacher whose unorthodox methods are initially met with disdain by the students, their parents and school administrators.In the end, as always, the teacher wins out.The tweak here is that Mr. Black is not a real teacher, and his methods involve &quot;rocking out.&quot; And the word &quot;rock&quot; must be pronounced &quot;RAWK&quot;.In standard &quot;teacher film&quot; mode, he brings out the best in his students, whether it be in a &quot;face-melting&quot; guitar solo, or genius-level computer-designed light shows.Richard Linklater displays a gentle touch he's never displayed before, but still manages to be a bit subversive and snarky. You're carried along so effortlessly that when the time comes to &quot;name the band&quot;, it's perfectly obvious but you honestly never considered it until that moment.Good movies entertain you even when you &quot;know where they're going.&quot; This movie is telegraphed by the opening credits, yet you're still surprised from time to time.Jack Black rules the show, and he does 'act' here. Yes, his manic rock-star flailings are what you'd expect, but the smaller scenes with the kids or with Joan Cusack somehow DON'T feel like they're from a completely different movie (as usually is the case).The supporting cast is fine as well. Mike White, his beleaguered roommate (and the film's author) and Sarah Silverman (a delicious harpy) are note perfect. Joan Cusack gives her usual inimitable performance...I think what she's doing is taking the classic wacky &quot;Joan Cusack&quot; character, and expanding in certain directions to fit each film she's in. She's never boring.The children are amazing. They really play, and play really well. They're funnier than all get out. It's easy to root for them.My only quibble is that the bass player gets minimal screen time, but maybe that's part of the joke.The bass player is ALWAYS overlooked in rock bands, aren't they?If the singer of the rival band sounds familiar, he's the original 'Roger' from the musical &quot;Rent&quot;, Adam Pascal.You can see all the disparate elements coming together by the end of the movie...like I said, &quot;telegraphed&quot;...but it's a joy to watch.This is a great rock movie AND a great family movie.Name another one that fits both categories.Tough, huh?",4,"Jack Black: over the top, yet huggable?",1080777600,"04 1, 2004",2004,2760,"['Liking', 'movie', 'how', 'feel', 'character', 'known', 'Jack', 'Black.If', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'still', 'might', 'like', 'film.If', 'kinda', 'really', 'enjoy', 'film.If', 'LOVE', 'Jack', 'Black', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane.', 'quot', 'film', 'Jack', 'Black', 'film', 'masses', 'eccentricities', 'yet', 'somehow', 'lovable', 'fairly', 'standard', 'quot', 'beloved', 'teacher', 'quot', 'film', 'kind', 'outsider', 'teacher', 'unorthodox', 'methods', 'are', 'initially', 'met', 'disdain', 'students', 'parents', 'school', 'administrators.In', 'end', 'always', 'teacher', 'out.The', 'tweak', 'here', 'Mr.', 'Black', 'not', 'real', 'teacher', 'methods', 'involve', 'quot', 'rocking', 'out.', 'quot', 'word', 'quot', 'rock', 'quot', 'must', 'be', 'pronounced', 'quot', 'RAWK', 'quot', '.In', 'standard', 'quot', 'film', 'quot', 'mode', 'out', 'best', 'students', 'be', 'quot', 'face-melting', 'quot', 'guitar', 'solo', 'genius-level', 'computer-designed', 'light', 'shows.Richard', 'Linklater', 'gentle', 'touch', 'never', 'displayed', 'still', 'be', 'bit', 'subversive', 'snarky', ""'re"", 'carried', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'when', 'time', 'quot', 'band', 'quot', 'perfectly', 'obvious', 'honestly', 'never', 'considered', 'moment.Good', 'movies', 'entertain', 'even', 'when', 'quot', 'know', 'where', ""'re"", 'going.', 'quot', 'movie', 'telegraphed', 'opening', 'credits', 'yet', ""'re"", 'still', 'surprised', 'time', 'time.Jack', 'Black', 'rules', 'show', ""'act"", 'here', 'Yes', 'manic', 'rock-star', 'flailings', 'are', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'smaller', 'scenes', 'kids', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'somehow', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'completely', 'different', 'movie', 'usually', 'case', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fine', 'as', 'well', 'Mike', 'White', 'beleaguered', 'roommate', 'film', 'author', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'delicious', 'harpy', 'are', 'note', 'perfect', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'usual', 'inimitable', 'performance', 'think', 'what', 'doing', 'taking', 'classic', 'wacky', 'quot', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'quot', 'character', 'expanding', 'certain', 'directions', 'fit', 'film', 'never', 'boring.The', 'children', 'are', 'amazing', 'really', 'play', 'play', 'really', 'well', ""'re"", 'funnier', 'get', 'out', 'easy', 'root', 'them.My', 'only', 'quibble', 'bass', 'player', 'minimal', 'screen', 'time', 'maybe', 'part', 'joke.The', 'bass', 'player', 'ALWAYS', 'overlooked', 'rock', 'bands', 'are', ""n't"", 'singer', 'rival', 'band', 'sounds', 'familiar', 'original', ""'Roger"", 'musical', 'quot', 'Rent', 'quot', 'Adam', 'Pascal.You', 'can', 'see', 'disparate', 'elements', 'coming', 'together', 'end', 'movie', 'said', 'quot', 'telegraphed', 'quot', 'joy', 'watch.This', 'great', 'rock', 'movie', 'great', 'family', 'movie.Name', 'one', 'categories.Tough', 'huh']",School of Rock

It has fun with the history of rock, its cliches, and even race, privilege and mone all at the same time.  Black plays a down on his luck rocker named Dewey, who poses as his best friend to be a substitute teacher at a posh private school, filled with kids who know more about Handel than Hendrix.  Dewey changes all of that by making his class believe that there is a state-wide project that involves all schools to form a rock band and battle it out.And the kids Dewey meets along the way all turn out to be gifted musicians, as well as fodder for some of the funniest comedy to come along this year.  His band is made up of an Asian (on piano), African-Americans (back-up singers), and stiff white guys (on guitar and drums).  But the ""School of Rock"" has a sweetness and a genuine nature about it that transends race and heritage, not to mention the kids in the movie are immensely talented.

Is this the twisted dude that stared in the short-lived HBO series about being a lunatic rock demigod suffering in obscurity with his bro K.G.?Well...sure it is, but a kinder, gentler Jack Black, like the one we glimpse in King Kong and saw so long ago in Shallow Hal.Sponge extraordinaire and underground rock God in training Dewey Finn is struggling with his band and his muted rock genius as well as his roommates new girlfriend who wants him to stop sponging and start paying some rent.  He gets kicked out of his own band for his onstange antics and ultimate lameness.  Things really suck.  A phone call from a Prep School for his roomie Ned is intecepted by the Finn and bingo, the plan is hatched.  Horace Green needs a substitute teacher for a few weeks and Dewey needs some Benjamins (money).  How hard could it be?Dewey become Ned and takes over a classroom full of overachieving brainiac Yuppie larva.  Boredom ensues until, by chance, Dewey overhears his students wailing away in music class.  What is going on?

The only time I've seen Jack Black previously was in SHALLOW HAL and I anticipated that he was going to be the same type of character and kind of a jerk, that the movie would be filled with sight gags and corny jokes.  Not so.The humor in this movie comes from the illogical and highly improbable premise of a down-on-his-luck rock musician faking it as a substitute teacher at a prestigious private school.  Learning that these kids are learning to play classical music, he gets the idea of teaching them the principles of rock music, and the movie goes from there.  The rock musician is definitely an intelligent individual, not a stumblebum or jerk.  Actually, he is one who lives for rock music, who has almost a religious fervor for the music and for performing it.  And Jack Black is surprisingly good in portraying this.Bottom line:  I liked it.

Well, I suggest this as your next rental (or purchase)...I'm sure you've heard of this movie by now, as it has been raved about by critics and movie-goers alike. Jack Black gives one of his best performances yet (only rivaled by his position as a stoner brother in Orange County and as a wise ass vinyl CD shop worker in High Fidelity) and boosts every scene that much more. All the kids in this movie actually play each instrument, which is pretty amazing considering their age.Black plays a washed-up rocker who just got kicked out of his band for the ""outdated"" 15-minute solos and stage dives. He needs to get in a new band but he also needs a job to pay for his rent of living with a friend (Mike White) and his whiny girlfriend in an apartment. His girlfriend finally convinces White to make Black start paying the rent, so Black getsthe idea to pretend to be White's character when called upon to sub in one of the nation's top schools. As long as his friend doesn't know, it will give me a place to stay until I get in a band, Black figures. So he basically lets the kids have recess all day while he sleeps, until he hears them in music class and gets the idea to make a band out of them and compete in the Battle of the Bands against many others, including his previous band that kicked him out.Despite how amazingly far-fetched and ridicoulus the plot is, if you can realize that it's just a movie, you will definetly enjoy yourself.

It's about a dumped rocker who found a higher purpose in life, higher than himself and getting to appreciate the joy of serving others other than himself.  Naturally, all the young musicians here (ten years of age on average) are VERY talented musicians and they aren't musical instruments synching as the Milli Vanilli did.  They rocked, indeed.  Having said that, the movie wouldn't do without Jack Black's personality.  The movie got rather long-winded towards the end but overall, it's a light entertainment to be enjoyed on a rainy day or a quiet night at home.  The DVD version contained several interesting &amp; watchable additional features such as spending a day with the young musicians during the Toronto Film Festival, MTV diary journal of Jack Black, Jack Black's plea to Led Zeppelin to use their song for this movie, interviews with all crew that is concerned.

Let's put the silly music-based humor of Jack Black from Tenacious D and his role in High Fidelity and put it in a non-religious Sister Act II.Well, I was wrong.While there isn't really much in the way of being really ""spectacular"" filmicly, Linklater wisely sets the camera back and lets the real talent shine.  Most dominantly, what is immediately received from this film is that these kids rock.  But what's really important is that these kids really, really do rock.  Combine them with the personality of Black and the acting of Joan Cusack, and you get really enjoyable performances all around.Also, Mike White's writing and roll in this film are very much worth mentioning.  What seems like a typical story really does have things to say about following your dreams, but more importantly it also shows the pitfalls of those dreams as well...  the characters willing to ""sell out"", the fact that they don't really win the competition, the necessity of avoiding those that just want to use rock as a way to be a bum...  all of that is cleverly put in there.  Just Cusack's little monologue when her character's drunk in the van with Black is enough to point out that there's actually real substance behind this script and it's not just a cop-out Hollywood film.Which is great because it's also low on the overt ""stupid loser"" jokes that tend to be mostly thrown around in the attempt to make a story about a supposed loser funny.  It's also low on language, so really it can be very enjoyable for many reasons, whichever way you want to approach it.It seems on the cover to be a film that would be a quick fad and then eventually disappear into the annuls of lost comedies, but if it actually does, that's tragic, because it really is a film worth appreciating.--PolarisDiB",4,Ya wouldn't think it at first...,1132444800,"11 20, 2005",2005,1858,"['saw', 'commercial', 'movie', 'thought', 'seemed', 'real', 'groaner', 'Let', 'put', 'silly', 'music-based', 'humor', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Tenacious', 'D', 'role', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'put', 'non-religious', 'Sister', 'Act', 'II.Well', 'was', 'wrong.While', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'way', 'being', 'really', 'spectacular', 'filmicly', 'Linklater', 'wisely', 'camera', 'back', 'real', 'talent', 'shine', 'Most', 'dominantly', 'what', 'immediately', 'received', 'film', 'kids', 'rock', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'kids', 'really', 'really', 'do', 'rock', 'Combine', 'personality', 'Black', 'acting', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'get', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'performances', 'around.Also', 'Mike', 'White', 'writing', 'roll', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'mentioning', 'What', 'typical', 'story', 'really', 'have', 'things', 'say', 'following', 'dreams', 'more', 'importantly', 'also', 'pitfalls', 'dreams', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'willing', 'sell', 'out', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'win', 'competition', 'necessity', 'avoiding', 'just', 'want', 'use', 'rock', 'way', 'be', 'bum', 'cleverly', 'put', 'there', 'Just', 'Cusack', 'little', 'monologue', 'when', 'character', 'drunk', 'van', 'Black', 'enough', 'point', 'out', 'actually', 'real', 'substance', 'script', 'not', 'just', 'cop-out', 'Hollywood', 'film.Which', 'great', 'also', 'low', 'overt', 'stupid', 'loser', 'jokes', 'tend', 'be', 'mostly', 'thrown', 'attempt', 'make', 'story', 'supposed', 'loser', 'funny', 'also', 'low', 'language', 'so', 'really', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'many', 'reasons', 'whichever', 'way', 'want', 'approach', 'it.It', 'cover', 'be', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'quick', 'fad', 'then', 'eventually', 'disappear', 'annuls', 'lost', 'comedies', 'actually', 'tragic', 'really', 'film', 'worth', 'appreciating.', 'PolarisDiB']",School of Rock

When his friend and his friend's girlfriend threaten to kick him out because he can't come up with the rent, he poses as a substitute teacher.  Originally he thought that it would be an easy $650 a week, but soon he realized that this might also be his way into the competition.  When he discovers the kids are musically talented, he brings in his instruments and preps them for the battle of the bands.The kids are adorable and talented, there's no doubt.  They play off of Black's character very well.  While his character starts off with selfish needs, he soon grows into a well-rounded individual who truly cares about the students he's working with.  The kids are typical children, generally selfish also, but occasionally unsure about how talented they are.

This teetered on the edge but landed strong for the awesome performances by Jack Black and Joan Cusack, the style of the film's direction, and of course, the soundtrack.The people who made it probably realized the plot was too weak and unconvincing to drive itself, so they made a smart move by using the plot as a tool to display the great behavioral comedy. Jack Black impersonates his best friend to get smoe money substitute teaching. There's a problem, though. He knows nothing about the cirriculum. Instead he teaches them little goodies like the definition of a hangover. ""Does that mean you're drunk?"" ""Close. It means I was drunk yesterday.""The film sympathizes with him but only to a point. Sure, he's an innocent guy who only wants to make great music, but he's also self-absorbed and refuses to take responsibility for anything. The film shows him for what he really is, a creep.But then something happens. He finds out the kids are talented classical musicians. He decides to harness that energy into rock lightning by mentoring them into his lifestyle.It all leads up to a battle of the bands featuring School of Rock in one of the best musical numbers of the new millenium. The furious parents watch it and grow proud. It's tacky, but the scene is pulled off with such grace and style, I didn't even mind.

Fortunately, for us, he has a revelation and the result is no end of fun and good cheer. This low-life slacker comes to terms with his own ability to shape young minds burdened with the typical teen-angst, such as bullies, insecurity, non-understanding parents, self-esteem and the like (which he seems to naturally understand). Mr. Black is absolutely absurd in his approach, and it's the kids who inspire him to be a better person. The success of this film is largely due to wonderful direction from maverick director, Richard Linklater; ""The School of Rock"" takes off and flies high. The very able support of Joan Cusack is not to be forgotten. What I found most intriguing about the film is that each kid has a story to tell, and you find yourself cheering for the kids. The story doesn't say a lot about what happens to Black's character, but you know these once up-tight kids are going to be fine. Jack Black is the lead, but the kids are the real stars.

No doubt the hidden basis for this movie was so that Black could play his own music. Writer Mike White (Ned Schneebly in this film) nailed Jack Black (Dewey Finn) to a tee. The story follows Dewey shreading on a guitar solo (just a tad long and over done), and being exiled from the band the very next day. His roommate (Ned) and annoying girlfriend (Patty - played perfectly by Sarah Silverman) get on his case about responsibilities and paying the rent. Dewey receives a phone call at home one day (meant for Ned)... the high priced private elementary school needs a substitute teacher. Dewey acts as Ned - and the fun and musical fusion begin. This movie is a &quot;toast to those who rock!&quot; The main kids in the band, Zack-Freddy-Lawrence-Katie, are all accomplished musicians in their own right and were picked to play their roles for just this reason. Not to mention Joan Cusack was a great pick as Priniple Mullins. Musical tributes to AC/DC and Led Zeppelin abound. If you're a Jack Black fan, as well as a classic rock fan - I guarantee you will truly enjoy this film. Extras on this DVD include often funny commentaries with Black as well as the kids; a short pitch to Led Zeppelin for permission to use a song in the movie, trailers and a music video. Ever since Black was able to let loose in John Cusack's &quot;High Fidelity&quot;... I just look forward to everything he does. This is a great and upbeat movie for all audiences.",5,Sell my guitars?

Essentially this is the story of an out-of-money rocker, who poses as his teacher friend and substitutes at an exclsuive school in order to earn some cash. He ends up turning his young class into a rock music class, teaching the kids about rock, and forming them into a band as a class project.

One of my favorite scenes is when she cuts loose and starts singing in the restaurant.  This movie has great music too.  I loved all songs performed by the band.

&amp; its done to perfection--- its a comedy of course as well--and so the academy with their proverbial heads up their proverbial rear ends would never stoop so low as to recognize something like this as worthy of that statue and the prestige pseudo prestige it brings-- no-- they like the phony crap like lost in translation that pretends to be artful or whatever that nonsense was-- or the hobbit nonsense ---but lets get down with the good stuff and rock and rolllllllllllllllllll- this movie kicks ass--- and joan cusack jack black mike white the impeccably well cast kids-- the great momentum of what might be considered not the most original script idea but the dialogue is perfect in its vernacular tone - so consistent throughout- in that sense perfectly brought to life -like i say amidst all the boring movies of last year which to me was the worst year in movie history !!! this movie should have won all the awards for sheer entertainment value!! heartwarming and done with love &amp; real fervor---it restores hope ! and jack black is a real pro---- hes a consummate comedian with great instincts and he rocks this movie heartily !! dont waste yer time with hobbits and spoiled rich kids adrift in tokyo or or phony cinematically polluted mystic rivers--- check this one out ! and although the genre is kind of limited--- it aint tolstoy ! but its honest and pure in its own right-- and refreshing to say the least--- &amp; in the absense of anything else besides the garbage that garnered all those coveted statues-- this movie looms even larger !

795755,A1FPFWDC1ASYNJ,B00018U9FW,Rodrigo Llamozas,"[2, 3]","While it's never going to be a classic, The school of rock is one of those movies that are just plain fun to watch and that won't lose any of its charm even if you watch it many times.Jack Black plays Dewey Finn, a thirty-something rockstar wannabe who crashes at his friend Ned's (Mike White) place. His band just gave him the pink slip and Ned's girlfriend (Silverman) is pressing for him to move out (he hasn't paid rent in a loooong time). One day the phone rings. It's a high-up school looking for Ned to take a position as a substitute teacher, but it's Dewey who answers and assumes Ned's identity in order to make some much needed money.While at school, Dewey finds out that the kids in his class can play some music, albeit it classical, and decides to enroll them in a rock band to enter a 'Battle of the bands' competition (unbeknownst to them). He turns the classroom into a rehearsal studio and teaches the kids how to become rock musicians. All of this behind the back of the school's principal, played by Cusack.Black succeeds enormously in balancing his crazy rockstar persona with the subtleties of handling the children, and while he learns a lesson in responsibility by the end of the movie, he never betrays the true spirit of his character. The kids who play the students are simply amazing. I had never seen any of them before, so I'm guessing their acting experience is limited, but they give great performances across the board.For me, the only weak spot of the film comes in the scenes between Black and Cusack. Usually a scene stealer, she comes out pretty subdued and boring in this film - maybe because her character demanded it - and it adds very little to the movie.There are some great classic tunes in this movie and great musical references from Black (Led Zep, Hendrix, ACDC and a whole bunch of groups).",4,4.5 stars,1082592000,"04 22, 2004",2004,1838,"['never', 'going', 'be', 'classic', 'school', 'rock', 'one', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lose', 'charm', 'even', 'watch', 'many', 'times.Jack', 'Black', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'thirty-something', 'rockstar', 'wannabe', 'who', 'friend', 'Ned', 'Mike', 'White', 'place', 'band', 'just', 'gave', 'pink', 'slip', 'Ned', 'girlfriend', 'Silverman', 'pressing', 'move', 'out', ""n't"", 'paid', 'rent', 'loooong', 'time', 'One', 'day', 'phone', 'rings', 'high-up', 'school', 'looking', 'Ned', 'take', 'position', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'Dewey', 'who', 'answers', 'assumes', 'Ned', 'identity', 'order', 'make', 'much', 'needed', 'money.While', 'school', 'Dewey', 'out', 'kids', 'class', 'can', 'play', 'music', 'classical', 'enroll', 'rock', 'band', 'enter', ""'Battle"", 'bands', 'competition', 'unbeknownst', 'classroom', 'rehearsal', 'studio', 'kids', 'how', 'become', 'rock', 'musicians', 'back', 'school', 'principal', 'played', 'Cusack.Black', 'enormously', 'balancing', 'crazy', 'rockstar', 'persona', 'subtleties', 'handling', 'children', 'lesson', 'responsibility', 'end', 'movie', 'never', 'true', 'spirit', 'character', 'kids', 'who', 'play', 'students', 'are', 'simply', 'amazing', 'had', 'never', 'seen', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'acting', 'experience', 'limited', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'board.For', 'only', 'weak', 'spot', 'film', 'scenes', 'Black', 'Cusack', 'Usually', 'scene', 'stealer', 'out', 'pretty', 'subdued', 'boring', 'film', 'maybe', 'character', 'demanded', 'very', 'little', 'movie.There', 'are', 'great', 'classic', 'tunes', 'movie', 'great', 'musical', 'references', 'Black', 'Led', 'Zep', 'Hendrix', 'ACDC', 'whole', 'bunch', 'groups']",School of Rock
795756,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00018U9FW,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","***1/2 After distinguishing himself in any number of memorable supporting roles, Jack Black finally comes into his own in ""The School of Rock,"" a sporadically funny comedy that is part ""Sister Act"" and part genial spoof of all those movies about a ""super teacher"" who brings meaning and purpose to the lives of his students.Black plays Dewey Finn, an aging rock'n'roller who is still awaiting that moment when he will ""make it big"" in the music world.  He lives with Ned Schneebly, his longtime rocker buddy, who has traded in his dreams of musical glory for a nagging girlfriend and a job as a substitute teacher.  Desperate for money to pay the rent, Dewey pretends to be Schneebly and takes a job as a sub at a snooty, tradition-bound prep school, where the last thing the administration and the parents would want is a Jimmy Hendricks knockoff teaching their kids.  And since Dewey really only knows one thing, this uncredentialed professorial imposter decides to make rock'n'roll the sole focus of his curriculum, turning these inward, shy, nerdish kids into a viable rock band - all under the radar screen of the ever-watchful administrators and parents of course.Although the storyline wends its way along a predictable path, writer Mike White and director Richard Linklater find a great deal of warmth and humor in the material.  Dewey's utter obsession with rock music and rock history is reflected in the fact that he leads the band members in a prayer to the ""god of rock"" before a concert, and screams in frustration -  ""What have they been teaching you kids at this school?"" - when he finds out his pupils have never been educated in the basics of Hendricks, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.  Dewey is so preposterously well-meaning and good-natured that the audience can't help but root for him and his students as they embark on their mad quest to appear at a local battle of the bands competition, unbeknownst to the powers-that-be at the school.The children playing the students are all winning and charming, and Joan Cusack cuts a sympathetic figure as the uptight school principal who harbors a little bit of Stevie Nicks under her prim and proper exterior.  But it is Black who makes this film his own, turning what might have been a buffoonish caricature into a fully-rounded human being.  Black is not afraid to cut loose and take over the screen when necessary, hitting heights of unbridled mania to rival the master, Jim Carrey.  Yet, he also realizes that he is part of an ensemble effort here and understands the importance of integrating himself into the material and not always dominating it.  As a result, even when certain elements of the film fall flat, as they frequently do, Black is always there to prop the movie back up.""The School of Rock"" is an entertaining little comedy, but unlike a real satire which would skewer the conventions of the genre it is attacking, this film loses its nerve and winds up endorsing those conventions.  Dewey, for all his talk about defying ""The Man,"" is really a rebel in name only, and the film reflects the kind of feel-good populism that no true hard line iconoclast would be caught dead supporting.

795758,A2UAOP0VUA12EQ,B00018U9FW,"Sam Allen ""A zealous individual""","[0, 0]","In high school, I must have rented this movie countless times from Netflix. It was my absolute favorite movie, but then I kinda forgot about it for a while when I ultimately fell off of movies a bit. That was, until I realized I had forgotten to bring my own movie to watch during my most recent blood platelet donation. I simply HAD to watch it again, hoping it would recapture at least some of the magic it had for me as a high schooler. I'm happy to say it didn't recapture SOME of the magic; rather, it recaptured every bit of it. But you may ask, why do I still love this movie so much?Well, for one, it makes great use of some of my favorite music of all time. Songs by iconic bands such as AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, The Ramones, The Who and Cream (among others) help add the appropriate musical assistance to an already phenomenal and somewhat heart-warming story. Jack Black plays arguably the most appropriate role for him (outside of Tenacious D at least). Personally, I would kill to have him as my substitute teacher. The writing in the movie, and the overall plotting, are very well played out; it never drags, and it isn't laden with predictability. The writers of this movie definitely knew what they were doing in terms of making a movie about rock 'n' roll.The kids in the movie are absolutely precocious and phenomenal. They have actual CHARACTER to them rather than just being cute, and all the ones who perform with the band are ACTUALLY playing and singing, both during the music class scene and during the rock band practice. No autotune, no air guitar, no lip synching, no ghost keyboards... it's all natural. And the song the band plays at the Battle Of The Bands competition is a phenomenal anthem that deserved to be a smash hit, honestly. Finally, the best thing about this movie: it teaches kids who may see it a bit of history of some REAL music. Forget about today's scene, tripe like Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber and the Jonas Brothers are topping the charts and it's depressing. This movie gives kids insight onto when music was not about corporate sellouts like them, but about one thing and one thing only: REBELLION, sticking it to ""the man"" (a common phrase throughout the movie) rather than giving in to what ""the man"" wants you to do.The bottom line is that for a rock 'n' roll history lesson, a great story, and a chance to watch some kids really show what they have as musicians, then this movie is perfect.

795760,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00018U9FW,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 1]","Whether you agree with any given review of ""School of Rock"" is determined entirely by whether you are a fan of Jack Black or if you think he is the most annoying actor working today.  Full disclosure -- I love his work, just as I generally can't stand the films of Adam Sandler or David Spade.  (You realize that you really, really need to get a life when you realize you have just participated in a raging debate over the respective merits and flaws of ""Joe Dirt,"" ""Happy Gilmore,"" and ""School of Rock."")In a role that Jack Black could play in his sleep, Black plays Dewey Finn, a slacker whose dream is to be a God of Rock.  (As a child of the 70s, I knew a few guys liks this -- the kind of guy who can't study for a history final but has memorized all the liner notes for every Metallica album.)  A talented guitarist who is too in love with the music, Finn is booted out of his band after too many 20-minute solos and unsuccesful stage dives.  And all just before a Battle of the Bands is scheduled, with a hefty purse.  In the life of Dewey Finn, this rises to the level of tragedy.To make matters worse, his best buddy's girlfriend has shrewishly demanded that Finn be kicked out of their apartment for the mere fact that Finn does not pay his share of the rent. Wonder of wonders, Finn intercepts a phone call meant for his buddy (a substitute teacher, whom Finn hilariously keeps referring to as ""temping"") from the uptight principal (Joan Cusack) of the most exclusive school in town.  Thinking quickly, Finn is soon on board as the substitute in his friend's place -- at least he can get the paycheck and keep his corner of the apartment.As can be expected, the class is a bunch of wonderfully cute, very talented kids who have all creativity stifled by the school and their uptight parents.  But in a fit of inspiration, Finn concocts a scheme to have these kids be his band (he will of course sing lead vocals and play lead guitar) so he can enter the Battle of the Bands.Here is where the movie takes off.  The kids all ring true, and Finn exercises a lot of creativity to make sure that all 20-odd kids have roles in the band, even if they can't play an instrument.  And the kids who can play an instrument or sing are pretty darn good.  In perhaps the movie's most touching component, Finn realizes that while he can teach these kids a lot about music (""Rock History,"" ""Rock Appreciation and Theory,"" etc.), he can learn a lot from them, too.  And he doesn't learn sappy ""lessons about life"" -- he learns that these kids are gifted musicians who can teach him more about music, as well.As charming as the kids are, this is Jack Black's picture from start to finish.  His inherent mania for rock music is apparent in every scene, and Black may have the most devious set of eyes in film today.  Contrary to W.C. Fields, who said that no actor should ever work with kids or animals, Black is also very comfortable working with the kids, treating them with a nice balance of respect and disdain that seems very true to his character.  The delightful Joan Cusack gets some nice moments as the repressed principal with a Stevie Nicks fetish, but this isn't her meatiest role.A genuinely funny movie that has a conventional plot (is there any wonder whether these kids will get to play in the Battle of the Bands?), ""School of Rock"" is a fun entertainment.  Surprisingly kid-friendly (I expected more profanity) without being mawkish, this movie offers a good balance of cliche and originality that makes it worthy of the film library.",4,Predictable Yet Hilarious Jack Black Flick,1114560000,"04 27, 2005",2005,3544,"['agree', 'given', 'review', 'School', 'Rock', 'determined', 'entirely', 'are', 'fan', 'Jack', 'Black', 'think', 'most', 'annoying', 'actor', 'working', 'today', 'Full', 'disclosure', 'love', 'work', 'just', 'generally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'films', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'David', 'Spade', 'realize', 'really', 'really', 'need', 'get', 'life', 'when', 'realize', 'have', 'just', 'participated', 'raging', 'debate', 'respective', 'merits', 'flaws', 'Joe', 'Dirt', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'School', 'Rock', 'role', 'Jack', 'Black', 'could', 'play', 'sleep', 'Black', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'slacker', 'dream', 'be', 'God', 'Rock', 'child', '70s', 'knew', 'few', 'guys', 'liks', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'study', 'history', 'final', 'memorized', 'liner', 'notes', 'Metallica', 'album', 'talented', 'guitarist', 'who', 'too', 'love', 'music', 'Finn', 'booted', 'band', 'too', 'many', '20-minute', 'solos', 'unsuccesful', 'stage', 'dives', 'just', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'scheduled', 'hefty', 'purse', 'life', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'level', 'tragedy.To', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'best', 'buddy', 'girlfriend', 'shrewishly', 'demanded', 'Finn', 'be', 'kicked', 'apartment', 'mere', 'fact', 'Finn', 'not', 'pay', 'share', 'rent', 'Wonder', 'wonders', 'Finn', 'phone', 'call', 'meant', 'buddy', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'whom', 'Finn', 'hilariously', 'referring', 'temping', 'uptight', 'principal', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'most', 'exclusive', 'school', 'town', 'Thinking', 'quickly', 'Finn', 'soon', 'board', 'substitute', 'friend', 'place', 'least', 'can', 'get', 'paycheck', 'keep', 'corner', 'apartment.As', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'class', 'bunch', 'wonderfully', 'cute', 'very', 'talented', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'creativity', 'stifled', 'school', 'uptight', 'parents', 'fit', 'inspiration', 'Finn', 'scheme', 'have', 'kids', 'be', 'band', 'will', 'course', 'sing', 'lead', 'vocals', 'play', 'lead', 'guitar', 'can', 'enter', 'Battle', 'Bands.Here', 'where', 'movie', 'off', 'kids', 'ring', 'true', 'Finn', 'lot', 'creativity', 'make', 'sure', '20-odd', 'kids', 'have', 'roles', 'band', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'instrument', 'kids', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'instrument', 'sing', 'are', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'most', 'touching', 'component', 'Finn', 'can', 'teach', 'kids', 'lot', 'music', 'Rock', 'History', 'Rock', 'Appreciation', 'Theory', 'etc', 'can', 'learn', 'lot', 'too', ""n't"", 'learn', 'sappy', 'lessons', 'life', 'kids', 'are', 'gifted', 'musicians', 'who', 'can', 'teach', 'more', 'music', 'well.As', 'charming', 'kids', 'are', 'Jack', 'Black', 'picture', 'start', 'finish', 'inherent', 'mania', 'rock', 'music', 'apparent', 'scene', 'Black', 'may', 'have', 'most', 'devious', 'set', 'eyes', 'film', 'today', 'Contrary', 'W.C.', 'Fields', 'who', 'said', 'actor', 'should', 'ever', 'work', 'kids', 'animals', 'Black', 'also', 'very', 'comfortable', 'working', 'kids', 'treating', 'nice', 'balance', 'respect', 'disdain', 'very', 'true', 'character', 'delightful', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'nice', 'moments', 'repressed', 'principal', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'fetish', ""n't"", 'meatiest', 'role.A', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'movie', 'conventional', 'plot', 'there', 'wonder', 'kids', 'will', 'get', 'play', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'School', 'Rock', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'Surprisingly', 'kid-friendly', 'expected', 'more', 'profanity', 'being', 'mawkish', 'movie', 'good', 'balance', 'cliche', 'originality', 'worthy', 'film', 'library']",School of Rock

Dewey advice his roomate to dump her, but Ned doesn't want to because he is afarid that he may never have another girlfriend again. Ned works at a substitute teacher, that he working to become a cetrifed teacher, and then his band decides to take the upcoming band of bands, seriously, and they fire him, and replaces by the time he finds out. And Dewey is mad to hear that he band has decided to vote him out of the banbd, so he decides to form a new one, even though he if the founder of the band that kicked him out of the band, then a call from a Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack)  who is the  principal of a prep school named Horce Green, lookingo for Ned who came reccomend by a person from another school, to sub for a teacher name Mrs. Dumbam when she falls, and brakes her leg. Dewey shows up to the school pretending to be Ned, and takes the job. At first he tells the kids to have ressces, nad tears down dermit sheet, and tells the kids there will be no grades, gold stars or demits. And the next day, he just sleeps at the desk, until one of the students wants to learn from the teacher, but when Dewey discovers that the kids can play music, he turns the classroom into a studio by the time that they come back from music class, and soon everybody has a job in a class project, and he puts 3 of the studnets, including one of th student Summer (Miranda Cosgrove) groupies, but she finds out that her job is to sleep with the band, I get from an on;-ine disctory, this is what groupie means:Main Entry: groupiePronunciation: 'gr&uuml;-pEFunction: noun1 : a fan of a rock group who usually follows the group around on concert tours2 : an admirer of a celebrity who attends as many of his or her public appearances as possible3 : ENTHUSIAST, AFICIONADO &#60;a political groupie&#62; &#60;golf groupies&#62;And then Dewey/Ned gives her a promtion to band manger, and puts her in charge of everything.

He's the fish out of water trapped in a world where all fat comics are out of control, slightly disturbed (or disturbing) funnymen who pulverize their surroundings while needling the audience with a knowing half-smile. So it goes with &quot;School Of Rock,&quot; a vehicle tailor made for this kind of physical comedy. Since Black, as a beautiful loser manchild, is perfectly suited for this kind of format, it stands to reason that &quot;School Of Rock&quot; is not as bad as it would be without someone as manic for the lead would have made it.I do have a slight problem with the kids, as they are as unhip a bunch as could be gathered together as characters. Let's face it, for the most part I hated my parents' music by the time I was in High School. So to insist that the students would suddenly find themselves grooving to the likes of Yes or Hendrix is little more than a boomer parent's fantasy of what kids would be suckered into if they'd only hear some REAL classic rock music. This is not to say the child actors here aren't lovable, in fact they help to balance Black in some of his more grating moments.Joan Cusak is also, as usual, delightful. The scene where she gets sweet talked into the field trip by Black while listening to Stevie Nicks is a hoot. Screenwriter White has the kind of understanding for this material that Chris Columbus and Cameron Crowe bring to a lot of their films. While I can't give this the kind of total Rock and Roll endorsement that I would give to the likes of &quot;Almost Famous,&quot; &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; or &quot;Rock and Roll High School,&quot; it did make &quot;School Of Rock&quot; a pleasantly laughable afternoon's comedy viewing.PS.

For those not in the band, Dewey assigns them jobs such as security, roadie, groupie, and the pretty and snooty Summer gets the job as Band Manager.The Bulk of the movie has Black teaching the kids rock while ducking the inquiries of the prim and proper principal played by Joan Cusack.The movie is fairly formulatic..you've seen similar plots in movies like &quot;Mighty Ducks&quot;  or &quot;Bad News Bears&quot;  where a down and out guy rallies a group of kids and makes them believe in themselves and perform strongly.

At first, he has no idea what to do, but when he discovers the kids in the class are great musicians, he decides to turn them into a band.

If nothing else, the soundtrack is great with plenty of Led Zeppelin, The Clash, Black Sabbath and so much more.Jack Black is perfectly cast as Dewie Finn, the down on his luck musician who takes a job as a substitute teacher.  His eyebrows and facial expressions could not be done by anyone else.  Joan Cusack is also very good as Principal Mullins, who tries to keep her school in order.  Mike White and Sarah Silverman also star as Ned, Dewie's roommate, and his evil girlfriend.  The real stars of this movie are the kids in Dewie's class.

But in School of Rock he puts in a epic role by comedic standards, mixing killer timing and hyperactivity with the ability to make scripted humor look natural.This movie is about rock music. To be more specific, smart kids from a prep school playing rock, and their substitute teacher loving rock more than anything else in the world. The movie will make you laugh for hours and sing along to the catchy soundtrack, as well as continually making you want to do your best air-guitar performance mid-song. A great comedy for everyone to laugh along to and enjoy.The DVD itself is great from a DVD-lovers' point of view. The anamorphic widescreen transfer is very clean, certainly up to the standard of movies made post-2000. The audio, seeing as music is crucial to this film, is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital and 2.0 Dolby formats, with the speakers coming into play for the concert and music scenes, and all dialogue is perfectly clear.The extras on this disc are not in abundance, but there is a good amount for a comedy, and all the special features are actually worth watching, unlike most DVD extras. There is a commentary with Jack Black and Richard Linklater - your standard director/actor showing, with good film-making insight and memories. The Kids Kommentary is suprising fun and well put together. The kids are the key to this movie, the make-or-break if you will, and make good comments about making the film.'Lessons Learned' is the standard cast interview featurette, basically advertising for the movie, but worth a listen. 'Jack Black's Pitch to Led Zeppelin' is an onstage begging to the remaining band members to ask for permission to use The Immigrant Song in the movie, nothing special but short enough to be worth a watch.There is a video clip of the film's main song School of Rock, and a rather amusing MTV Diary of Jack Black, as he goes about a strange day in the life of Hollywood's anti-hero.Hilarious film with Jack Black firmly in the spotlight and loving the attention, with a solid audio/visual transfer and good amount of extras.

It is not often that a movie can so effectively touch the funny bone of all ages, but School of Rock takes it to a whole new level.The basic idea behind School of Rock is that Jack Black's character is a rocker that is down on his luck and manages to get himself a gig as a substitute teacher and eventually has the students making rock music and the movie escalates from there. Black will go unappreciated for his work in this movie most likely, but he has helped create a classic that will live on forever.There is no one that will not find this movie entertaining if they sit back, relax and let Jack Black rock your face off.

So he gets a call saying they want his roommate to substitute teach(Which is what his roommate does) at one of the finest schools in America, so he pretends to be his roommate and substitute teaches at the school(Not knowing that the kids can play instuments very well) and tells them to go to recess for the whole day. then a day or so later he hears them in band and notices that they are very good. Then he thoought that maybe he could get the kids to play in the ""Battle of the Bands""with him, so he gets all the gear into the room and gives them all certain parts, like guitar(electric), Bass, keyboards,backup singers, and also puts people as lookout to make sure that no one finds out.

And in ""School of Rock"" he never changes -- the same old JB, who hangs around in your room only with underwear, who doesn't pay his share of rent.  But ""School of Rock"" is a different thing.  He is still loud, OK, but this time that makes the film better than you expect.Because you know this guy Dewey Finn played by Jack Black, after all, turns out a charming fellow among the likable kids.  JB's Dewey, in need of ready cash, disguises himself as a substitute teacher in a posh prep school (run by uptight principle Joan Cusack) and instead of math, he ""teaches"" the spirit of rock'n'roll to the children.  Of course, it won't take long before they enter the Battle of Bands, leading us to rousing finale.You may not like Jack Black's character at first, but as the film goes on, he starts to show unexpected side to his personality.  The monetary motive turns into genuine passion, and that is no news in Hollywood, but it is rarely done with such an energetic and hilarious performance as that from the leading actor.The kids not only can play the instruments, but also they can act, and many of them are given due moments to impress us.  Also great is Joan Cusack's comic acting, perhaps better than that of the sexually repressed fiancee in ""In & Out.""  Now her character here has something repressed deep inside -- which is again related to music.  Her turn (supported by a glass of beer in a bar) is simply wonderful.The script by Mike White (""Chuck and Buck"") who was JB's next-door neighbor knows how to extrect the better side of Jack Black's super-turbo comic turn. and though the story is not particularly unique, the result is a great success, especially when it shows the relations between the ""teacher"" and the students.  And director Richard Linklater (""Tape"" and many others) does not show his trademark off-beat feelings -- his handling of the material is surprisingly traditional, and that also helps greatly.And most of all, this film is good-hearted, and is not afraid of showing that on its sleeve.  You can enjoy watching it with the good soundtrack, and when JB tries to teach the kids the riff of ""Iron Man"" and many 70s classic rock, you can feel his love of music.",5,Jack Black Will Rock You at School ... with Joy and Laugh.,1083888000,"05 7, 2004",2004,2273,"['may', 'not', 'like', 'Jack', 'Black', 'always', 'too', 'noisy', 'often', 'too', 'annoying', 'School', 'Rock', 'never', 'same', 'old', 'JB', 'who', 'room', 'only', 'underwear', 'who', ""n't"", 'pay', 'share', 'rent', 'School', 'Rock', 'different', 'thing', 'still', 'loud', 'OK', 'time', 'film', 'better', 'expect.Because', 'know', 'guy', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'played', 'Jack', 'Black', 'out', 'charming', 'fellow', 'likable', 'kids', 'JB', 'Dewey', 'need', 'ready', 'cash', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'posh', 'prep', 'school', 'run', 'uptight', 'principle', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'instead', 'math', 'teaches', 'spirit', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'children', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'enter', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'leading', 'rousing', 'finale.You', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'Jack', 'Black', 'character', 'first', 'film', 'show', 'unexpected', 'side', 'personality', 'monetary', 'motive', 'genuine', 'passion', 'news', 'Hollywood', 'rarely', 'done', 'energetic', 'hilarious', 'performance', 'leading', 'actor.The', 'kids', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'play', 'instruments', 'also', 'can', 'act', 'many', 'are', 'given', 'due', 'moments', 'impress', 'Also', 'great', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'comic', 'acting', 'perhaps', 'better', 'sexually', 'repressed', 'fiancee', 'Out', 'Now', 'character', 'here', 'something', 'repressed', 'deep', 'inside', 'again', 'related', 'music', 'turn', 'supported', 'glass', 'beer', 'bar', 'simply', 'wonderful.The', 'script', 'Mike', 'White', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'who', 'was', 'JB', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'how', 'extrect', 'better', 'side', 'Jack', 'Black', 'super-turbo', 'comic', 'turn', 'story', 'not', 'particularly', 'unique', 'result', 'great', 'success', 'especially', 'when', 'relations', 'teacher', 'students', 'director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'Tape', 'many', 'others', 'not', 'show', 'trademark', 'off-beat', 'feelings', 'handling', 'material', 'surprisingly', 'traditional', 'also', 'greatly.And', 'most', 'film', 'good-hearted', 'not', 'afraid', 'showing', 'sleeve', 'can', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'when', 'JB', 'teach', 'kids', 'riff', 'Iron', 'Man', 'many', '70s', 'classic', 'rock', 'can', 'feel', 'love', 'music']",School of Rock

Then, one of the younger members of the band has a mutiny and kicks Dewey out.

Dewey gets the bright idea of getting the kids to be his new band and the musical hilarity begins.THE SCHOOL OF ROCK is implausible and is predictable (almost completely). However, it's also highly amusing and entertaining. I am not a huge fan of the rock music that is triumphed in the movie. Despite this, I was able to enjoy the movie and it's soundtrack. Jack Black is at his finest.  Also, Joan Cusack is perfect in her role as the strict principal, Rosalie Mullins, who longs for a little bit of love and friendship. The kids in the film are a joy to watch and the play off of Black's manic energy with an eager glee that the best of performers would have a difficult time dealing with.

But then one day a phone call arrives that inspires Dewey into action and he finds himself employed as a substitute teacher at a reserved private school. With a class of brainy nerds awaiting direction Dewey has nothing to offer except music.....and so the story unfolds. Dewey takes this class of intellects and turns them into a great kid's band despite the watchful eyes of the school headmistress Ms. Mullins (Joan Cusack).Jack Black is funny just watching him exist in all that hyper energy he possesses but in this movie he gets to also show his stuff around music. Although he is sometimes irritatingly crazy most of the time he is really great in this role as a teacher that knows absolutely nothing. Joan Cusack joins Black as the comic relief in this film as the rigid school marm with a secret passion to be Stevie Nicks and flaunt herself in a rock and roll band.

Yes, it's predictable, though that's not necessarily a bad thing, since it delivers on all the good feeling that one expects at the end of such a movie. Also, Jack Black is hilarious. It's just so fun to watch his mugging, dancing, wild gesturing and so forth. He is plain perfect for the part of Dewey Finn.But what's unexpectedly wonderful about ""School of Rock"" is how it is also a send-up of the ""inspiring teacher"" film. Black is so dominant in this film (and Joan Cusack makes such a fine prep-school principal) that it's easy to miss how unexpectedly great the kids are -- how convincingly and charmingly they play from inside their stereotypes, pushing on those types -- and also how unexpectedly realistic are the parents (not to mention Black's roommate the real Ned Schneebly). Just at the moment you expect the parents to cave in and embrace ""Mr. S's"" unusual methods, they surprise you, and react as real parents would.

795790,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00018U9FW,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[0, 0]","After being kicked out of his own band prior to the &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot;, Dewey Finn's desperation reaches a fevered pitch; he has no money, no way to earn any, no way to compete with his old band and take home the prize money. His roommate's controlling girlfriend wants Dewey kicked out of the apartment. That all changes with a single phone call. Dewey pretends to be his roommate Mike (Mike White) and takes the job of substitute teacher at a private school. Dewey soon discovers that teaching is much harder than playing air guitar. The competitive kids appear restless and ill-at-ease doing nothing. Dewey has no luck recruiting for his new band. Until he discovers his class practicing classical music in the music room. An idea blooms full blown like a bad heavy metal song. The kids will be HIS backing band.An inspired collision of indie sensibilities and Hollywood, the delightful &quot;School of Rock&quot; finally gives the talented performer Jack Black both a role he can sink his teeth into and one where he can demonstrate the chops he's honed as a member of Tenacious D. Black looks like a demonic Joe Cocker (prior to the beard of course) or Angus Young (AC/DC) after an eating binge. Black literally lights the movie up from within due to his infectious energy and humor. The screenplay by co-star Mike White (&quot;The Good Girl&quot;) was written specifically with Black in mind. Indie director Richard Linklater doesn't go the easy route; he makes Dewey into a likable slob who misleads, manipulates and twists everyone around so he can obtain his goal. Ultimately, Dewey is undone by his roommate's girlfriend otherwise he would have taken the charade all the way to the &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot;.Like &quot;The Commitments&quot; (the film this most closely resembles), &quot;School of Rock&quot; is at its best in the sequences where Dewey works with the class. Joan Cusack dives right into the heart of the uptight principal Rosalie Mullins and the scenes between her and Dewey are delightfully funny and charming. The best sequence between them involves Dewey asking her out for a drink so he can get her drunk. He's hoping to talk her into letting him take the kids out on a field trip (really the audition for the &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot;) by getting her to sing along to Stevie Nick's &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;. It's a crack up to see Cusack belt out the song in the biker bar that Dewey takes her to. The kids in the movie all give great performances. They appear natural and clearly are having a ball playing their roles as well as the instruments in the movie.The extras on the disc are exceptional. They include Jack pleading with Led Zep to let the film use &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;; the MTV Jack Black special as well as a very funny commentary by Black and director Linklater (plus a separate audio commentary track by the kids from the band). There's also a web site archive, the trailer, a video diary about the Toronto Film Festival and other great stuff.When you watch &quot;School of Rock&quot; you'll want to rock on with Jack and the kids!",5,Rock on Jack!,1078272000,"03 3, 2004",2004,3112,"['being', 'kicked', 'own', 'band', 'prior', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'quot', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'desperation', 'fevered', 'pitch', 'money', 'way', 'earn', 'way', 'compete', 'old', 'band', 'take', 'home', 'prize', 'money', 'roommate', 'controlling', 'girlfriend', 'Dewey', 'kicked', 'apartment', 'changes', 'single', 'phone', 'call', 'Dewey', 'be', 'roommate', 'Mike', 'Mike', 'White', 'job', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'private', 'school', 'Dewey', 'soon', 'teaching', 'much', 'harder', 'playing', 'air', 'guitar', 'competitive', 'kids', 'appear', 'restless', 'ill-at-ease', 'doing', 'nothing', 'Dewey', 'luck', 'recruiting', 'new', 'band', 'class', 'practicing', 'classical', 'music', 'music', 'room', 'idea', 'blooms', 'full', 'blown', 'bad', 'heavy', 'metal', 'song', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'HIS', 'backing', 'band.An', 'inspired', 'collision', 'indie', 'sensibilities', 'Hollywood', 'delightful', 'quot', 'School', 'Rock', 'quot', 'finally', 'talented', 'performer', 'Jack', 'Black', 'role', 'can', 'sink', 'teeth', 'one', 'where', 'can', 'demonstrate', 'chops', 'honed', 'member', 'Tenacious', 'D.', 'Black', 'demonic', 'Joe', 'Cocker', 'prior', 'beard', 'course', 'Angus', 'Young', 'AC/DC', 'eating', 'binge', 'Black', 'literally', 'movie', 'up', 'due', 'infectious', 'energy', 'humor', 'screenplay', 'co-star', 'Mike', 'White', 'quot', 'Good', 'Girl', 'quot', 'was', 'written', 'specifically', 'Black', 'mind', 'Indie', 'director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', ""n't"", 'go', 'easy', 'route', 'Dewey', 'likable', 'slob', 'who', 'manipulates', 'twists', 'everyone', 'around', 'can', 'obtain', 'goal', 'Ultimately', 'Dewey', 'undone', 'roommate', 'girlfriend', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'charade', 'way', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'quot', '.Like', 'quot', 'Commitments', 'quot', 'film', 'most', 'closely', 'resembles', 'quot', 'School', 'Rock', 'quot', 'best', 'sequences', 'where', 'Dewey', 'class', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'right', 'heart', 'uptight', 'principal', 'Rosalie', 'Mullins', 'scenes', 'Dewey', 'are', 'delightfully', 'funny', 'charming', 'best', 'sequence', 'Dewey', 'asking', 'out', 'drink', 'can', 'get', 'drunk', 'hoping', 'talk', 'letting', 'take', 'kids', 'out', 'field', 'trip', 'really', 'audition', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'quot', 'getting', 'sing', 'along', 'Stevie', 'Nick', 'quot', 'Edge', 'Seventeen', 'quot', 'crack', 'up', 'see', 'Cusack', 'belt', 'out', 'song', 'biker', 'bar', 'Dewey', 'kids', 'movie', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'appear', 'natural', 'clearly', 'are', 'having', 'ball', 'playing', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'instruments', 'movie.The', 'extras', 'disc', 'are', 'exceptional', 'include', 'Jack', 'pleading', 'Led', 'Zep', 'let', 'film', 'use', 'quot', 'Immigrant', 'Song', 'quot', 'MTV', 'Jack', 'Black', 'special', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'funny', 'commentary', 'Black', 'director', 'Linklater', 'separate', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'kids', 'band', 'also', 'web', 'site', 'archive', 'trailer', 'video', 'diary', 'Toronto', 'Film', 'Festival', 'other', 'great', 'stuff.When', 'watch', 'quot', 'School', 'Rock', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'want', 'rock', 'Jack', 'kids']",School of Rock
795791,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B00018U9FW,Wheelchair Assassin,"[58, 65]","""School Of Rock"" is nothing less than the feel-good movie of the year.  It's fitting that the movie is filled with blatant AC/DC worship, because it's very much like one of that band's albums: it's excessive and often lowbrow, but you can't help but enjoy it because it's so full of energy and enthusiasm.  And most importantly of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously.  Whether intentionally or not, director Richard Linklater and co. deal a major backhanded slap to all the sissified nu-metal and post-grunge ""sensitive guy"" bands currently dominating the airwaves, reminding us all that rock music is supposed to be fun and ultimately uplifting.First of all, if ""School Of Rock"" doesn't make Jack Black a star, nothing will.  Black gives one of the most lovably over-the-top performances in history as Dewey Finn, an aspiring metal musician who poses as his friend Ned in order to get a substitute teaching job at a posh elementary school.  From the opening scene at a rock club, where Dewey launches into a frenzied guitar solo, whips off his shirt, and attempts a stage dive into an apathetic crowd, Black is a whirlwind of manic energy.  Much like Jim Carrey, Black doesn't just play the demented role: he means it, and the authenticity he brings to the movie makes all the diference.  Quick, think of another guy who could pull off the role this well.  This is Black's show, and he knows it.When Dewey takes a position teaching the uptight children of uptight parents, the stage is set for a classic fish-out-of-water comedy.  Many of the movies' funniest moments come early on, when the overweight, disheveled Dewey and his privileged students can't quite figure out what to make of each other.  The plot?  Realizing that some of his students have musical talent, Dewey, under the guise of a school project, gets them to start up a rock outfit to compete at the local battle of the bands.  Along with the way he teaches them plenty about the history of rock and its value for, among other things, ""fighting the man.""  Naturally, the kids, their parents, and the school's principal (played by Joan Cusack, who would steal the movie if Black didn't), all learn valuable lessons about taking chances and enjoying life.This plot may sound rather hackneyed, but ""School Of Rock"" doesn't succeed by avoiding cliches; it succeeds my embracing them with all the vigor and passion of Dewey playing a guitar solo.  The movie's overbearing earnestness, which I typically find to be more of a turnoff than a woman with bigger muscles than me, turns out to be its greatest asset.  The reason?  Because ""School Of Rock"" conveys the too-often-forgotten lesson that people need to lighten up, and rock music has long been a valuable device for doing just that.  At its heart, the film's message is simple but enormously effective: that Rock 'n' Roll really just might be able to change the world.It all comes to a head in the film's monster conclusion, with Dewey donning an Angus Young-styled schoolboy uniform for the Battle of the Bands.  Black absolutely owns the stage in this scene; there's no way the image of him performing won't be indelibly etched in the minds of all who see it.  If you know your stuff, you can also see the nods to Yes and The Clash in the kids' attire.  The song the band performs, fittingly titled ""School Of Rock,"" is a lot like the movie itself: it's filled with rock cliches, but its youthful rebellion and energy more than make up for it.  It certainly beats much of what's on the radio today, just as the movie beats much of what's in your local multiplex.  Sometimes good intentions and inspired acting can carry a film, and ""School of Rock"" is one such example.",4,"Mellow out, man!",1068854400,"11 15, 2003",2003,3695,"['School', 'Rock', 'nothing', 'less', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'year', 'fitting', 'movie', 'filled', 'blatant', 'AC/DC', 'worship', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'band', 'albums', 'excessive', 'often', 'lowbrow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoy', 'so', 'full', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'most', 'importantly', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'Whether', 'intentionally', 'not', 'director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'co.', 'deal', 'major', 'backhanded', 'slap', 'sissified', 'nu-metal', 'post-grunge', 'sensitive', 'guy', 'currently', 'dominating', 'airwaves', 'reminding', 'rock', 'music', 'supposed', 'be', 'fun', 'ultimately', 'uplifting.First', 'School', 'Rock', ""n't"", 'make', 'Jack', 'Black', 'star', 'nothing', 'will', 'Black', 'one', 'most', 'lovably', 'over-the-top', 'performances', 'history', 'Dewey', 'Finn', 'aspiring', 'metal', 'musician', 'who', 'friend', 'Ned', 'order', 'get', 'substitute', 'teaching', 'job', 'posh', 'elementary', 'school', 'opening', 'scene', 'rock', 'club', 'where', 'Dewey', 'frenzied', 'guitar', 'solo', 'shirt', 'stage', 'dive', 'apathetic', 'crowd', 'Black', 'whirlwind', 'manic', 'energy', 'Much', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Black', ""n't"", 'just', 'play', 'demented', 'role', 'authenticity', 'movie', 'diference', 'Quick', 'think', 'guy', 'who', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'well', 'Black', 'show', 'it.When', 'Dewey', 'position', 'teaching', 'uptight', 'children', 'uptight', 'parents', 'stage', 'set', 'classic', 'fish-out-of-water', 'comedy', 'Many', 'movies', 'funniest', 'moments', 'come', 'early', 'when', 'overweight', 'disheveled', 'Dewey', 'privileged', 'students', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'make', 'other', 'plot', 'Realizing', 'students', 'have', 'musical', 'talent', 'Dewey', 'guise', 'school', 'project', 'start', 'up', 'rock', 'outfit', 'compete', 'local', 'battle', 'bands', 'way', 'plenty', 'history', 'rock', 'value', 'other', 'things', 'fighting', 'man', 'Naturally', 'kids', 'parents', 'school', 'principal', 'played', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'who', 'would', 'steal', 'movie', 'Black', 'did', ""n't"", 'learn', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'taking', 'chances', 'enjoying', 'life.This', 'plot', 'may', 'sound', 'rather', 'hackneyed', 'School', 'Rock', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'avoiding', 'cliches', 'embracing', 'vigor', 'passion', 'Dewey', 'playing', 'guitar', 'solo', 'movie', 'overbearing', 'earnestness', 'typically', 'find', 'be', 'more', 'turnoff', 'woman', 'bigger', 'muscles', 'out', 'be', 'greatest', 'asset', 'reason', 'School', 'Rock', 'too-often-forgotten', 'lesson', 'people', 'need', 'lighten', 'up', 'rock', 'music', 'long', 'been', 'valuable', 'device', 'doing', 'just', 'heart', 'film', 'message', 'simple', 'enormously', 'effective', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'really', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'change', 'world.It', 'head', 'film', 'monster', 'conclusion', 'Dewey', 'donning', 'Angus', 'Young-styled', 'schoolboy', 'uniform', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'Black', 'absolutely', 'stage', 'scene', 'way', 'image', 'performing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'indelibly', 'etched', 'minds', 'who', 'see', 'know', 'stuff', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'nods', 'Yes', 'Clash', 'kids', 'attire', 'song', 'band', 'performs', 'fittingly', 'titled', 'School', 'Rock', 'lot', 'movie', 'filled', 'rock', 'cliches', 'youthful', 'rebellion', 'energy', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'certainly', 'much', 'what', 'radio', 'today', 'just', 'movie', 'much', 'what', 'local', 'multiplex', 'Sometimes', 'good', 'intentions', 'inspired', 'acting', 'can', 'carry', 'film', 'School', 'Rock', 'one', 'such', 'example']",School of Rock

It's funny, cute, a bit of a musical, and heartwarming - all without being too preachy.Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a member of a rock band that's just about to make it big - except for one thing. Dewey's always messing up their shows by doing crazy tricks and trying to act cool, but he's really coming off as an idiot. When he gets kicked out of the band and needs to pay his roommate $2,200.00, he needs to find a way to make money...fast. So he poses as a substitute teacher at the best elementary school in New Jersey - and when he sees the kids playing in band class one day, he gets a great idea. Why not have the KIDS play as his band, and he can enter the Battle of the Bands contest. He's sure to win!This movie is hilarious...it has a bit of dirty humor (including lines like ""I have a hangover. Does anyone know what that means? It means I have a headache, and the RUNS!""), but I don't think it deserves the PG-13 rating. Everyone in the movie has talent - they act, sing, and play their own instruments. (I was more impressed by the kids' performances in this movie than the adults. They all seem so...real. Not like the characters in teen comedies.)The extras are great. I haven't seen all of them yet, just the 'School of Rock' music video, the kids audio commentary, 'Lessons Learned in School of Rock,' and the video diary of the kids' trip to the Toronto Film Festival.

795793,A1FT7QFKNHL9DT,B00018U9FW,Wolfe Moffat,"[1, 2]","When I first saw the title of this movie, I saw Jack Black on the cover. I'll admit with all honesty, I don't like Jack Black that well. He's always gotten on my nerves, and to say the least, never impressed me. But then my Bible study leader, (let me please repeat that) MY BIBLE STUDY LEADER recommended this by simply saying, ""It has a message."" As every movie usually does, and I wondered what it could possibly be. I took a chance when I viewed it, and was rewarded with nothing less then a top notch watch!So I watched Dewey Finn, basically a nobody, become somebody, to a classroom full of kids, who learn to have fun, while they also learn a little bit about self worth. CLASS IS IN SESSION!!!So, we're taken through an era of rock music! I loved it that it had a clip of Keith Moon, the late drummer of ""The Who"". It even had a sample of Led Zeppelin, and you don't exactly hear that in too many films these days, do you? And through it all, Dewey pretends to be his buddy, Ned. In the process, he teaches this class, but in a most unlikely manner, and with the most unlikely results. When an overweight girl isn't feeling very confident, Finn reminds her that Aretha Franklin was overweight, yet on stage, she blew the crowds away! The message that it doesn't matter who you are, or what others think of you, but it does matter what you bring to the stage, the stage of life, and self confidence, and about being your best! That's what a lot of us forget sometimes, and even though it could be goofy, sometimes screwy, it was a wake up call that so many of us need. Let me put in simply... WAKE UP!!!Sticking it to the man, being hard core, all with a few good laughs in the process. And by the way, even for a PG-13, it wasn't too hard core, but it was all heart. If we would just learn a lesson that is so valuable through a little humor. Embrace this, and watch it again, and let it release you from a long, hard day! Jack Black, I'm impressed.

Jack Black confirmed his ""God"" status yet again to me. I think this was his best movie yet. Giving Jack Black a starring role in a movie about rock music was the single best decision made by Hollywood in 2003. Needless to say, I was stunned, and even after the movie was done, I stayed and watched the end credits sequence. The reason this movie worked was because although it was aimed primarily at children, it was *NOT* a kid's movie: it was a FAMILY movie. That is, everybody, young and old, male and female, smart and stupid, could enjoy it. If you were a kid, you got some funny physical humor with nary a flatulence joke in sight (thank GOD)! If you were an adult, you got some funny subtle music references. And the peculiar thing is this, my friends: this movie worked on multiple levels. If you wanted just straight-forward, good-natured comedy, you got it. If you wanted an inspirational story that sends a good message to kids, you sure got it. If you wanted a movie that kicks MTV in the face and glorifies REAL rock music, you definitely got it. This movie is about a lot of things, and it isn't preachy or heavy-handed, nor does it have stupid plot twists (I was very happy that one of the kids didn't end up with cancer or break their arms or something). I was surpremely enthralled with this movie, and I bow down at the altar of Jack Black, for bestowing his glory upon yet another quality work of cinema. The only gripe I have is that it would have been nice to see just a *little* more tension between the kids' parents and Jack Black, especially towards the end, but hey, it was still a great movie.",5,Now raise your goblet of rock.
