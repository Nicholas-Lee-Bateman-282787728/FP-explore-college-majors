It was a bizarre, completely disconnected series of skits and gags - think of the Zucker/Abrams/Zucker movie AIRPLANE! and you'll get a fraction of an idea of how crazy the play was - brought to the screen by Hollywood, who screwed it up as much as they usually do by insisting on shoehorning a love story and extra musical numbers into it. At the beginning of the movie, Olsen and Johnson actually get into an argument with the director about this, saying that the stage play was a success without all that Hollywood junk in it. They even sit down with the director and watch the film in an MST 3K style for a few minutes before the movie proper begins. Although it's true that the gags are dated, this is still an entertaining, insane movie that, if you look at it with the right eyes, is WAY ahead of its time.

After their successful Broadway play of ""Hellzapoppin'"" they brought it to film.  As it seems to be the habit with these two, the film is loaded with big names of the era they were made in, and the style is almost the classical ""musical"" style so prevalent in that time.  I have very pleasant memories of this film, because my cousin and I used to watch these when we were quite young, like around ten or so, on WRGB out of Schenectady.  This station played quite a bit of Olson and Johnson at the time, and this was one of many, such asCrazy House, and ""Ghost Catchers"".""Hellzapoppin'"" will have you laughing almost from the get-go.  The two zanies portray themselves, while their cousin Louie is played by Shemp Howard, later of the ""Three Stooges"" fame.  Martha Raye is their man-crazy relative, who relentlessly pursues Mischa Auer's character, a somewhat phony prince.  The whole shebang is a play within a play within a play, and is an absolute hoot.  The musical numbers are of the type that was standard for tha era, and are very well done.I strongly recommend this movie for anyone who likes good, old-fashioned fun, slapstick, almost a joke-a-minute, and good musical numbers.  If this setup seems a bit familiar, it's because it was used not too long ago by Rowan and Martin's ""Laugh-In.""

Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[0, 0]","It took awhile for me to obtain Ole Olsen & Chic Johnson's zany masterpiece &#34;Hellzapoppin'&#34; on DVD, as it's been in high demand and the price has been ridiculously high. Their first film for Universal was the film adaptation of their notoriously crazy stage show, which has been known to be so wildly improvisational that it was never the same show twice. The adaptation's results? Well, if you were around to actually see O & J's show, you would know it was pure insanity. The film version seems to be a compromise in form between the boys & Universal, as they must make room for the conventional &#34;romantic plot&#34; and &#34;musical numbers&#34;. But don't worry; there's plenty of room for wild sight gags, props, surprises and the boys simply running amok. It certainly didn't hurt to add the boisterous talents of Martha Raye, who fits quite well into the boys' &#34;anything goes&#34; sensibility, as she's adept at both music and comedy. The opening scene with the boys going to hell in a taxicab breaks the &#34;fourth wall&#34; of conventions. The random gags of the woman shouting &#34;Oscar!&#34; and the man with the growing tree paging &#34;Mrs. Jones!&#34; are smartly worked in from the stage show. And well, there's just so many wildly funny moments to mention here; see it for yourself.Definitely a sorely underrated classic that's gotten lost in the shuffle over the years.

1035494,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000KP7N3W,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[11, 12]","Hellzapoppin' (H. C. Potter, 1941)There was a time, believe it or not, when Hollywood was actually open to the idea of... skewering Hollywood. (Not only that, but nominating a film skewering Hollywood for an Oscar, even if it was only for Best Original Song.) One of Hollywood's great parodists was Nat Perrin, better remembered these days for being the producer of TV's megahit The Addams Family. Perrin, however, poked more fun at his Hollywood contemporaries than one can shake a sizable stick at during his writing days. And when it came to turning the sacred cows into shish kebabs, Perrin never did it better than in his stage-play-turned-Hollywood-blockbuster Hellzapoppin'. Despite being well-received in its day, the movie has faded well into obscurity over the past half-century; it seems the only American DVD release of the film is long out of print. This despite it being on Jonathan Rosenbaum's list of the thousand best movies ever made, a list I'm starting to think of as the canonical one. He's usually on the money; I've seen a lot of fantastic films I'd never have seen had I not come across that list, and this is the latest of the bunch.The film stars Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson, a vaudeville comedy team who never quite made it in pictures, but were still popular long after vaudeville was. Here, Ole and Chic are contracted to make a movie. The director, however, isn't happy with what he's got, so he brings in a new writer. And what a story this guy dreams up. There's a love triangle, a Russian count (or so he claims) pursuing Johnson's sister, a big wedding that hinges on the success of a new Broadway play, and... well, I've just scraped the tip of the iceberg here. A full plot summary of this would be as long as the movie itself, there's so much going on here. All of it, of course, as a framework for the silliest gags imaginable.But that's what makes Hellzapoppin' work so well--the stupid thing is out-and-out hysterical for much of its length. Imagine Renoir's The Rules of the Game as written by Howie Mandel viewed after the ingestion of copious hallucinogenic substances, and you've got the merest beginnings of the idea. Now, that said, the comedy isn't the only thing it's got going for it; despite the many threads running through here, the plot holds together pretty well, and there are some laudable performances to be had here, especially Mischa Auer as the crazy Count. Potter (Mister Blandings Builds His Dream House) wasn't exactly a slouch in the director's chair, either, which always helps.A long-neglected American classic that needs to be brought back. You can check it out through Amazon's Video on Demand service, and given the cost of a seven-day rental, what have you really got to lose? Absolutely worth every penny, and a whole lot more. Can't recommend this one highly enough.

Its appearance, at last, on DVD is marvelous because it must be in my top five favorite comedy movies.  There is a storyline: the hero puts on a musical, hoping it will be a success so that he can marry his true love.  But in Hellzapoppin any story would do because it is just there as a foil for Olsen and Johnson to move from one visual gag to another in double quick time and it is probably unique in cramming so much in.There is something extra though.  This is most likely the only comedy to extensively explore the potential of film itself.  Tex Avery did it in his cartoons and Woody Allen used the idea for the 'Purple Rose of Cairo' but Hellzapoppin writers Perrin and Wilson really took advantage of the idea.  So, a few of these include freeze frame, split frame: with O&J; split in half and trying to push the top half of the frame up to correct the fault, a cinema projectionist talks to O&J;, they annoy him so he puts on a western, part of which has an Indian shooting O&J;, messages are flashed on screen (as in Saturday morning kids shows) telling Stinky Miller to go home, this happens in a romantic musical number with the two singers stopping and they tell Stinky to go home, a black silhouette appears and he leaves.The use of the film aspect of Hellzapoppin was the cherry on the cupcake for me  but even without it I think it would still be an incredibly funny movie.
