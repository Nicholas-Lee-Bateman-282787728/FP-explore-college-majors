Has a very good cast and seems well acted, paced, and directed but honestly, I could have gone my whole life without seeing it and it wouldn't make a difference. The plot is nothing short of a cliche fest of gangster and action movies.1.  A secret team setup to take down an impossible enemy2.  Protagonist's wife is pregnant and uses the ""I need you to be a father, not a hero"" on him3.  One of the good guys is banging the bad guy's woman and ""If he finds out we're dead"" ensues4.  Both guys from #1 and #2 do the ""I'm sending you out of town"" thing to their respective women5.  The whole ""secret team"" are misfits6.  Oh yeah, the good guy banging the bad guy's woman was warned by a friend not to but...he did anyway of course ""Gotta die of something""7.  The bad guy is super angry and does pretty much nothing but lose his temper the whole movie8.  The ""secret team"" has a cowboy that can shoot anything and everything but only with his six gun9.  The ""secret team"" is immediately tracked down by the cowboy's partner, who wasn't invited, and uses the line ""Good enough to get the drop on you guys"" and instantly is on the team.10. A single team member dies igniting the teams collective passion11. Protagonist is saved at the last second by dying member #2 before defeating the bad guy in fisticuffs12. Of course there is the 5 minute part of how the team is recruited and they all got a tiny moment to be cool13. Secret team's first mission is a disaster14. Are rewarded by the chief after successful mission and...""I could tell you good job, but I was never here""15. Goodest guy quits the force after bad guy is caught16. Second goodest guy gets the hot girl that used to be the bad guy'sI bought this Blu-ray DVD Ultraviolet copy on sale at Worst Buy for $10 as an alternative to going to the theater one Saturday.

1501842,AG5XM49AZVIYH,B005S9ELVC,"Ben ""Pizza Enthusiast""","[0, 0]","Gangster Squad is an entertaining film about an off-the-books crew of Los Angeles cops who try to take down Mickey Cohen, the baddest, most powerful gangster around. It is straightforward action with an appropriate amount of drama sprinkled throughout. If you like shoot-em-up gangster films complete with car chases, fist fights, and tommy guns, look no further. If you're looking for something original that tries to distance itself from worn out clich&eacute;s, you will hate Gangster Squad.Some examples of the clich&eacute;s I'm talking about:-Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is so brutal to his cronies it's amazing anyone wants to work for him at all.-Sergeant O'Mara (Josh Brolin) cannot give up the bad-guy-busting lifestyle, and his wife (Mireille Enos) complains accordingly.-Mickey's girl (Emma Stone) is actually Jerry's (Ryan Gosling) girl, but she struggles to break from Mickey and his money.-The gangster squad begins to question the morality of its mission.-Corrupt cops, politicians, and judges abound; they create problems every time the film needs more drama.-Faceless bad guys go down easy, but central characters waltz through crossfire from submachine guns unscathed....And many more. The gangster squad itself is made up of every cop clich&eacute; in film. Their leader (Brolin) is the tough, go-hung, incorruptible hero. Jerry (Gosling) is the burned out cop who doesn't think the gangster squad can make a difference. Harris (Anthony Mackie) is the token black cop who is really good with a knife. Kennard (Robert Patrick) is the weathered gunslinger who only fights with his six-gun. Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi) is the tech-savvy brains of the bunch. Navidad (Michael Pena) is the tag-along who looks up to Kennard and tries to prove himself. By the end of the movie it's all quite boring, really.While enjoyable and action-packed, there really is nothing special about Gangster Squad aside from its all-star cast. The clich&eacute;s keep it from ever getting too interesting or dramatic (because we all know the movie is destined to end in a shootout where men on both sides will surely die) and really only serve to undermine a story that had potential. Don't get your hopes up for an inside look at Mickey's operation or intricate character development, either.

Well, it wouldn't make any difference, except that the true story of Mickey Cohen and Chief Parker is far more interesting than than this simple cops and robbers story.  Parker is shown (barely) as a model of virtue and Mickey Cohen, who apparently charmed the pants off of everyone from Bugsy Segal to Billy Graham is shown as a standard movie psychopath.  Along the way, people are killed who didn't actually die and the end is more like Sands of Iwo Jima than what really happened.Other than a lack of complexity to the characters and the overall fiction of the story, Gangster Squad is beautifully shot, well acted and occasionally cleverly written.

1501875,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B005S9ELVC,DanD,"[0, 0]","Let's get something straight here: GANGSTER SQUAD is based on a true story...very loosely based.  It's an intriguing story, one worth checking out (Paul Liberman's source book is a must-read for fans of real life noir): Jewish gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), a former boxer, has made a name for himself in 1930s Los Angeles.  He's brutal (that opening scene is a killer, followed shortly by another) and remorseless, and he wants nothing less than the possession of L.A.'s corrupt soul.Enter the Gangster Squad.  Generaled by a grizzled Chief Parker (Nick Nolte), and captained by a tough-as-nails moralist (Josh Brolin), featuring a cowboy (Robert Patrick), a rookie (Michael Pena) a genius (Giovanni Ribisi), a hustler (Anthony Mackie, because everyone knows 1939 L.A. was racially integrated), and a bad boy with a heart of gold (Ryan Gosling), who happens to be falling for Cohen's latest dame (Emma Stone).Sound familiar?  Well, it is.  It's a by-the-numbers production, featuring over-the-top dialogue and action sequences, a whole lot of coincidence, two-dimensional characters (for example: in reality, Chief Parker was hardly the crusading white knight he's portrayed as here), and violence for the sake of violence.  Think THE UNTOUCHABLES, but without Kevin Costner's off-putting likability.  In the leading role, Brolin is merely cruising, but he knows what to do and does it right.  Penn makes a deliciously hatable villain; his dialogue is atrocious (perhaps intentionally), but Penn digs in deep and growls out every syllable, coming off as truly menacing, in a B-movie sort of way.  The rest of the supporting cast balances their roles well; Stone, like most women in gangster films, has little to do, and there is surprisingly little chemistry between her and Gosling (who is sleepwalking even more so than Brolin).  The acting is, basically, on the level one would expect it to be, given the fact that its stellar cast is basically slumming it up.  However,  GANGSTER SQUAD looks good; it's a gorgeous production that embraces its noir roots and runs with it.  This may seem like shallow praise, but it isn't; if you lower your expectations to a realistic B-movie level, GANGSTER SQUAD is one of the more enjoyable gangster films of recent years.  It's not a classic, but it never tries to be; it's entertaining, plain and simple.

Director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) already blew my trust with 30 Minutes Or Less, so I was cautiously optimistic about Gangster Squad. Then the Aurora incident occurred and the film was forced to undergo reshoots. That awesome trailer that sells the film as a gritty flick about cops operating outside the law? Total lie. This film tonally cannot handle itself. It simultaneously attempts screwball, slapstick while taking itself too seriously. Based very loosely on a book called Tales from the Gangster Squad, it takes so many liberties that the awesome literally bleeds out leaving a hollow husk of a film. Ryan Gosling talks with an incredibly annoying and soft voice, Brolin tries to play the straight man in this farce and no one apparently told Sean Penn that he was in a comedy because he acts as if he's in a drama (his villainous turn as Mickey Cohen is the high point). Character motivations were embarrassingly sloppy (esp. in regards to Ryan Gosling's character).Should you buy it? I'm a film buff. As such, I hated this film. I would not buy this if it was in a dollar discount bin (which it inevitably will be in a few months). Worth a view? At times it can be funny (even when it's trying to be serious), so as a comedy it could work for a rental. It's an ok bad movie, but not bad enough to be a classic (a la Troll 2 or The Room). If you want mindless fun, go for it. If you want a good gritty film, I highly recommend anything by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, Bronson, Pusher, Valhalla Rising, etc.)",2,Needed to figure out what kind of film it wanted to be...,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,1699,"['Gangster', 'Squad', '2013', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Michael', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'Robert', 'Patrick.Thoughts', 'Was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Director', 'Ruben', 'Fleischer', 'Zombieland', 'already', 'blew', 'trust', '30', 'Minutes', 'Or', 'Less', 'was', 'cautiously', 'optimistic', 'Gangster', 'Squad', 'Then', 'Aurora', 'incident', 'occurred', 'film', 'was', 'forced', 'undergo', 'reshoots', 'awesome', 'trailer', 'film', 'gritty', 'flick', 'cops', 'operating', 'law', 'Total', 'lie', 'film', 'tonally', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'simultaneously', 'screwball', 'slapstick', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'Based', 'very', 'loosely', 'book', 'called', 'Tales', 'Gangster', 'Squad', 'so', 'many', 'liberties', 'awesome', 'literally', 'out', 'leaving', 'hollow', 'husk', 'film', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'talks', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'soft', 'voice', 'Brolin', 'play', 'straight', 'man', 'farce', 'one', 'apparently', 'told', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'was', 'comedy', 'drama', 'villainous', 'turn', 'Mickey', 'Cohen', 'high', 'point', 'Character', 'motivations', 'were', 'embarrassingly', 'sloppy', 'esp', 'regards', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'character', '.Should', 'buy', ""'m"", 'film', 'buff', 'such', 'hated', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'buy', 'was', 'dollar', 'discount', 'bin', 'inevitably', 'will', 'be', 'few', 'months', 'view', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'even', 'when', 'trying', 'be', 'serious', 'so', 'comedy', 'could', 'work', 'rental', 'ok', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'be', 'classic', 'la', 'Troll', '2', 'Room', 'want', 'mindless', 'fun', 'go', 'want', 'good', 'gritty', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anything', 'Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'Drive', 'Bronson', 'Pusher', 'Valhalla', 'Rising', 'etc']",Gangster Squad
1501896,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B005S9ELVC,D. S. Thurlow,"[44, 50]","""Gangster Squad"" is an old-fashioned crime-fighting thriller set in the L.A. of the late 1940's, complete with period sets, a solid cast, and a suspenseful story.  It claims to be based on a true story, but the average viewer probably won't worry about the history.  The average viewer will be too busy wondering just how vicious the fight between two-fisted mobster Mickey Cohen and a group of vigilante cops is going to get, and who might get hurt in the process.As the story opens, Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is staking out his criminal turf, while most of the police force has been paid to look the other way.  The police chief (a grizzled Nick Nolte) taps honest police sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) to set up an off-the-books gangster squad.  With the help of his wife, O'Mara picks five other police officers prepared to take on Cohen and his mob.  Among them is Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling), O'Mara's army buddy, who also happens to have a very dangerous thing going with Cohen's moll (Emma Stone).  The gangster squad gets to work, and Mickey Cohen soon becomes aware that his operation is being dismantled right under his nose.  Cohen will come after the gangster squad, and their friends and families, setting up a big finale at an L.A. hotel.The pacing of the movie is perhaps a little uneven, but its best moments make up for it.  The gunfights are pretty exciting, and the movie makes the good guys worry about the collateral damage.  Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are quite good together, as in a different way are Josh Brolin and Mireille Enos, who plays his wife.  The movie has an old-fashioned ending, but that is the point.

Mobster Mickey Cohen has become the most powerful California mobster, and intends to continue spreading his influence.Of course, there are a few uncorrupted cops who don't intend to let him do that, even if they have to step outside the law. And so we get ""Gangster Squad,"" which has a dream cast and a stylish noirish look, but also fails to really impress with storytelling or character development. It's not dreadful, but it's not as good as it should be.Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) rules the Los Angeles underworld, with the help of corrupt cops and judges. After saving a girl from some of Cohen's thugs, Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) is called in by the police chief with a very special mission: destroy Cohen's criminal empire, and send him packing from LA. O'Mara's pregnant wife Connie (Mireille Enos) isn't pleased by this.With Connie's help, O'Mara quickly assembles his ""gangster squad"" -- a strong street detective (Anthony Mackie), a wire-tapper (Giovanni Ribisi), a gunslinger who targets gangsters (Robert Patrick) and his partner (Michael Pe&ntilde;a). They're also joined by Wootens (Ryan Gosling), who is having a clandestine affair with Cohen's mistress/etiquette coach Grace Faraday (Emma Stone).And after a little training, the Gangster Squad begins taking down Cohen's empire -- they attack casinos, kill Cohen's men, and basically wreck all his business. But when Cohen deduces who they are and what they're doing, he decides to strike back.""Gangster Squad"" is a decent movie, but it should be a truly brilliant one. It has a talented all-star cast including Penn, Gosling and Brolin, a lot of flashy gangster violence and sleaze, and it's directed by the guy who brought us ""Zombieland."" But somehow... just somehow... it doesn't quite gel as a film.Ruben Fleischer gives postwar L.A. a pulpy, glitzy look that grows more gritty and rough as the film unwinds. He also seems to be having a lot of fun with all the blasting guns, burning money and dramatic death scenes, such as when one man is thrown in a pool and shot.But there isn't really anything memorable during the scenes of vigilante justice. The squad just bursts in and blast away unnamed mooks, then moves on to the next target. Some parts are so painfully Hollywood that it burns -- consider the ditchwater-dull relationship between Wootens and Grace, which seems to just be in the movie because we needed a romance between two hot young people.The movie also tries to bring up the moral aspect of vigilantism (Keeler says that they're no different from Cohen) but immediately drops it without saying yea or nay. Seriously, don't do that. It just makes the story seem shallow.Fortunately, this is somewhat compensated for by the awesome casting. Sean Penn is all wiry sneering and snarling as Mickey Cohen, a sadistic thug who believes it's his ""destiny"" to rule the western US. Penn is not in the movie very often, but he brings an electric energy to whatever scenes he is in.Brolin is also excellent as a soldier-turned-cop who hasn't quite lost his urge to fight for what he believes in, and who wants to expunge the corruption from the City of Angels. Ryan Gosling does a passable job, even though his whole role is basically to romance Stone. And while the rest of the cast isn't fleshed out as much, we get some excellent low-key performances from Mackie, Patrick, Nick Nolte, Enos and Ribisi.""Gangster Squad"" should really be a much better movie than it is, but the solid acting from a great cast keeps it afloat.

This movie captures Los Angeles better than most and in that setting it creates a credible story with a fine cast that, apart from the gore of dismembering a body attached to two opposing cars and a lot of bullets and killings, makes a case for the idea of a group of rogue cops bringing Mickey Cohen down.In 949 Los Angeles gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) has moved in, with the intention of controlling all criminal activity in the city as well as an eye on the entire West Coast: his dream is to rid the crime world of the Chicago mobs' move to take over big crime in LA. He has bought local judges and police, and no one is willing to cross him or testify against him. Everyone except Sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), a former World War II soldier, whose goal is to settle with his family in a peaceful Los Angeles. Police Chief William Parker (Nick Nolte) decides to form a special unit whose mission is to take down Cohen, and chooses O'Mara to lead the unit. O'Mara, with the help of his pregnant wife (Mireille Enos) chooses 4 cops (Anthony Mackie, Robert Patrick, Michael Pe&ntilde;a, Giovanni Ribisi) and asks another cop and vet, pretty boy Jerry Wooters, to join him but Wooters is not interested: he incidentally is dating Cohen's current girlfriend (Emma Stone). But when he witnesses the murder of a young boy by Cohen's people, he joins them, and they decide to take apart Cohen's organization. Cohen wonders if a rival is going after him, but eventually he realizes it's the cops. The manner in which the dance between Cohen's henchmen and the gangster squad plays out is full of surprises and twist and turns and makes for solid entertainment. Based on a book by the same name by Paul Lieberman, adapted for the screen by Will Beall, and directed with skill by Ruben Fleischer, GANGSTER SQUAD may not be very close to the truth but is still is a fine movie diversion.

I've seen all of these actors in far better roles and far better movies, but hey, at least they all did a good job in this film.Now, one very important thing I need to touch on; Robert Patrick aka The T-1000Yes, this is the second movie I've seen him in since Terminator 2, and to be perfectly honest, I'm not sure what to think.Personally, I was just glad to see him holding a firearm again; considering the fact that in &#34;Bridge to Tarabithea&#34; he hadthe &#34;I wish James Cameron would put me in another one of his movies&#34; look on his face the entire time.The visual stylization was pretty cool, even though i've seen it used better in other movies (the slow motion in this movie sucks)This movie has very few redeemable things in it, I was bored most of the time, and I figured something interesting out; no matter how a mindless action movie is painted, I can see right through it and call it out when need be.Before I close, let me expound on the action comment above.The difference between this movie and, let's say Terminator 2 for example, is that Terminator 2 actually has a VERY deepstory about human beings, emotion, destiny, and sacrifice (why haven't I reviewed Terminator 2 yet?), and this movie triedto have moments of forbidden love and moral dilemmas, but they just fell flat.Gangster Squad is a forgettable movie, and per my opinion, I'll probably never watch it again, so I guess that means26%- Big names, visual stylization and nostalgia can't save this long, boring and forgettable action movie",2,A 1920's Action Movie That Should Have Been Entertaining At The Very Least,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,1861,"['Boasting', 'similar', 'visual', 'style', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'movie', 'had', 'excited', 'little', 'didI', 'know', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'style', 'action', 'absolutely', 'substance', 'speak', 'of.So', 'movie', 'lot', 'big', 'names', 'way', 'many', 'big', 'names', 'Directors', 'think', 'need', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'not', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'actors', 'far', 'better', 'roles', 'far', 'better', 'movies', 'hey', 'least', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'film.Now', 'one', 'very', 'important', 'thing', 'need', 'touch', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'aka', 'T-1000Yes', 'second', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Terminator', '2', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'think.Personally', 'was', 'just', 'glad', 'see', 'holding', 'firearm', 'again', 'considering', 'fact', '34', 'Bridge', 'Tarabithea', '34', '34', 'wish', 'James', 'Cameron', 'would', 'put', 'one', 'movies', '34', 'look', 'face', 'entire', 'time.The', 'visual', 'stylization', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'even', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'used', 'better', 'other', 'movies', 'slow', 'motion', 'movie', 'movie', 'very', 'few', 'redeemable', 'things', 'was', 'bored', 'most', 'time', 'figured', 'something', 'interesting', 'out', 'matter', 'how', 'mindless', 'action', 'movie', 'painted', 'can', 'see', 'right', 'call', 'out', 'when', 'need', 'be.Before', 'close', 'let', 'expound', 'action', 'comment', 'above.The', 'difference', 'movie', 'let', 'say', 'Terminator', '2', 'example', 'Terminator', '2', 'actually', 'VERY', 'deepstory', 'human', 'beings', 'emotion', 'destiny', 'sacrifice', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'reviewed', 'Terminator', '2', 'yet', 'movie', 'triedto', 'have', 'moments', 'forbidden', 'love', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'just', 'fell', 'flat.Gangster', 'Squad', 'forgettable', 'movie', 'opinion', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'guess', 'means26', '%', 'Big', 'names', 'visual', 'stylization', 'nostalgia', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'long', 'boring', 'forgettable', 'action', 'movie']",Gangster Squad

First, it has some great actors in Sean Penn, who plays the infamous Mickey Cohen here, as well as Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Anthony Mackie, Michael Pena, Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Patrick, Mirelle Enos and Nick Nolte. Second, it's set in post-WWII Los Angeles, which, since the success and greatness of Curtis Hanson's L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, has been rife for storytelling opportunites. Third, it has the classic ""small group of men take on the entire mob"" trope that's worked well for decades.But while it has all those things, it ultimately falls too far short of being really good cinema by degenerating into a series of dull cliches, poor characterization and orgiastic, videogame-like violence. The characters are lifted from any number of previous law vs. mob films; Brolin is the stalwart, staunch, straight-laced leader, Gosling is the morally conflicted boozer and lady-killer, Mackie is the switchblade-wielding badass, Ribisi is the nerdy technical guy, Patrick is the grizzled, somewhat-racist old-timer gunslinger, Stone is the husky-voiced femme fatale, and Penn is the bat-poop crazy king of the mob. They're all tropes, which is fine, but if the actors even dared to delve outside the mold of these recycled characterizations, they might have had something special on their hands. But director Fleischer wasn't going to have any of that. This was pure, uncut Hollywood-designed filmmaking ready-made for mass consumption, which is fun enough to watch once, because it does look quite stunning, but if it somehow leaves an impression after you're done watching, you are clearly the audience this film was made for.",3,L.A.

We see:* Sean Penn (""Milk"") is Mickey Cohen, a former professional boxer with a nasty temper, brutal and merciless.

(with the Hollywoodland real estate development sign shining in the background.)* Emma Stone (""The Amazing Spider-Man"") is Grace, a favorite of Cohen's; Sgt. Wooters likes her, too....

He just wants to stay OUT of Burbank!* Yvette Tucker (""Me Again"") does a perfectly splendid turn as Carmen Miranda, complete with a towering headgear of fruit, singing at Slapsy Maxie's nightclub during a raid.This shoot-em-up is almost non-stop gunfire interspersed with blowie uppie stuff.

I did really enjoy Josh Brolin's performance though as it was the only real hooking point for me to not turn off the movie. You can see he is really mining his character for something interesting and he succeeds. I blame the uninspired script and direction for how a movie with this much genuine talent can make such a mediocre and disappointing movie.I hate using the word &#34;hammy&#34; but if there was anybody out there who says that Sean Penn's Mickey Cohen character was too hammy for its own good, I wouldn't argue with them at all. It wasn't a bad portrayal as it was a misguided one and one that would have been perfect in Dick Tracy.Ryan Gosling, who was great in Drive is...absolutely terrible here.  Ryan Gosling I believe was woefully miscast here because the stuff he said and did really irked me the wrong way. He is suppose to come off as the silent but dangerous right hand man of Brolin's character but came across as someone I wanted Mickey Cohen to bury alive in some remote desert or something. He is a major reason why I didn't like this movie. He is by far the most annoying character for me.The movie felt off from the get-go maybe because it was way too by-the-numbers gangster/cop flick and so it didn't have a real identity of its own. The best example is Guy Ritchie gangster movies and Quentin Tarrantino gangster movies. Very similar style, dialogue, music, pacing, structure, plot, and characters but despite all the major and minor similarities...they are their own movie and I enjoy both because of it.Gangster Squad, as a whole, does not distinguish itself from others like it. It is simply nothing special and nothing you will want to revisit anytime soon.Kind of SPOILER PARAGRAPH BELOWSpoiler Warning:Spoiler!!!-----------------I love cliche action flicks.

1501956,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B005S9ELVC,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.It's 1949 and Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is running Los Angles. A man who defines the term ""crime boss"" as he's not only the top cheese in the criminal underworld, but he also has both the police and judiciary on his payroll. In an attempt to bring Cohen to justice, Bill Parker (Nick Nolte) hand picks war veteran Sgt. John O'mara (Josh Brolin) to start an operation to do whatever he feels necessary to take this man down. With the help of his wife Connie (Mireille Enos), John rounds up a group of five guys to assist him.Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling), Office Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie), Officer Conway Keeler (Giovanni Rivisi), Officer Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena), and Officer Max Kennard (Robert Patrick). These are the five men John chooses. Each with different personalities and a different set of skills. Jerry is your run-of-the-mill pretty boy who falls for Cohen's lover Grace Faraday (Emma Stone), Coleman is a good shooter who's skilled with knives, Conway is the brains, Max is a quick shot who's almost always dead-on, and Navidad is a young officer who looks up to Max. A diverse group of men which allows for some interesting banter between the six of them.As a whole I thought the story was solid. When you go into films that are based off of a true story there's always going to be changes and fabrications so don't expect a perfect depiction of what went down. Also, because it's a gangster film things can get somewhat repetitive about halfway through, but that's to be expected. With that said, Gangster Squad is able to keep your attention because of the characters you're presented with. It may not always do a great job of fleshing out these characters (Grace & Navidad are the best examples here), but I found myself feeling for Jerry and even Conway, to some extent. Plus, even with the underdeveloped characters it's easy to fall in love with all of them due to their chemistry on screen.Surprise surprise, Gangster Squad is filled with violence, a lot of it. Apparently this was an issue with the big reviewers, but I'm not sure what they were expecting. Either way, if you or the company you chose to watch this with aren't a fan of really violent movies then I would recommend skipping this at all cost. From start to finish the violence is non-stop as you go from firefights to fist fights to stabbings. Then you rinse and repeat. This is definitely a hard ""R"" in terms of violence, but, as I said, it's kind of expected. It's a movie about a group of cops trying to take down a notorious gangster. If you're looking for rainbows and unicorns you're looking at the wrong movie.If watching movies is a hobby of yours then expect to recognize a few familiar faces. Chances are you've seen all six of these cops in something prior to this and Emma Stone and Sean Penn aren't strangers to the big screen either. With that said, just like the story, the performances in Gangster Squad are solid. No one really stood out or took my breath away, but at the same time no one really bombed either. The entire cast was able to give enjoyable performances that managed to keep my attention the entire way through. Even though the story follows these six cops, a lot of focus is put on John and Mickey. So most of the dialogue is coming from either Josh Brolin or Sean Penn. Thankfully both of them are able to hold their own and carry the movie for its two hour running time.Finally, the score, provided by Steve Jablonsky, is kind of a mixed bag. At times I really loved it because it felt perfect during the scene I was currently watching, but then there were other times where it just felt so out of place. It's almost as if the intensity level of the scene wasn't matching the intensity level of the composition. Of course, intense pieces are necessary in all films, but they have to feel right for their corresponding scenes. When the music is somehow distracting you from what you're watching it's no longer serving its purpose, it's just taking you out of the experience. Sadly, I found this to be a common occurrence while watching this film and it kind of hampered my enjoyment a bit.Overall Score: 7/10 - The problem with Gangster Squad is that, at times, it seems to take itself a bit too seriously. Some of my favorite moments from the movie were when the six officers were just joking around and enjoying each others company. Now I know that would make for a boring film if that's all that we were given, but it seems to lack a consistent flow. Also, the casting was fantastic, but by the end of it I felt like I still didn't know who most of these characters were. You had a group of extremely talented performers, but none of their characters really got fleshed out. While Gangster Squad may not be one of the best films ever made, it's enjoyable enough to warrant a viewing. So if you were eyeing it in theaters then I would suggest giving it a rental.",4,7/10 - It's ok,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,4948,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.It',

Sean Penn gives an outstanding performance as mob boss Cohen and the rest of the cast is solid as well in their roles.

Mierendorf,"[4, 7]","Gangster Squad is Zombieland director Ruben Fleischer's first full drama film and only his third feature, but it's his best yet and ends up being one of the best gangster movies since L.A. Confidential, it's thematic cousin. The film will go down with a lingering footnote in relation to the theater shooting in Aurora, CO last July. A crucial scene involving gangsters shooting a theater audience was removed and the context was rewritten and reshot out of respect to the horrific real life events. The film was also delayed from its original September release to this Friday. Despite the unexpected changes, the film works wonderfully.The film, based on true events, begins in 1948 Los Angeles as gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is establishing his foothold on the city and ultimately the West Coast. In the opening scene it's quite clear that Cohen will hold nothing back and that he's as ruthless as he is evil. In the next scene, we're introduced to the heroic Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) as he single-handedly beats the hell out of some of Cohen's lower level crooks. In an expertly-written (screenplay by Will Beall) introduction, we meet Sgt. Jerry Wooters (scene-stealing Ryan Gosling). Gosling absolutely steals the show in his portrayal of Wooters, which will come as no surprise to his fans of his recent roles (Drive). After struggles to stop Cohen, L.A.P.D. Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) instructs O'Mara to form a small squad to break Cohen's operation apart.The squad is a delight to watch in action, including the minor stumbles along the way. Fleischer has a keen eye for dramatic action and even manages to bring humorous, lighthearted moments from Beall's script to life. The gangster squad is given plenty of time to develop the camaraderie and it's clear they function at their best as a crew. Grace Faraday (Emma Stone) is a fresh take on the femme fatale and Stone is great in the role. It's truly an ensemble film and the cast all deliver fantastic performances.It's a shorter film for its type (just shy of two hours), but it has a balanced flow. Fleischer inserts his Zombieland-esque slow-motion moments, but they're used less for cool sequences and more to reinforce the view from the characters involved who are firing their guns rapid-fire, with time moving in apparent slow motion. It's also a visually beautiful film and feels entirely authentic in its time period. It's absolutely the late 40&#8242;s and the time period of L.A. matches up perfectly with other dramas of the same time. Overall, it's a fun and exciting ride that really shines from the wonderful cast performances and turned out as a pleasant surprise.Verdict: Absolutely see in theaters",4,A Classic Gangster Film With Modern Flair,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,2688,"['Gangster', 'Squad', 'Zombieland', 'director', 'Ruben', 'Fleischer', 'first', 'full', 'drama', 'film', 'only', 'third', 'feature', 'best', 'yet', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'gangster', 'movies', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'thematic', 'cousin', 'film', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'lingering', 'footnote', 'relation', 'theater', 'shooting', 'Aurora', 'CO', 'last', 'July', 'A', 'crucial', 'scene', 'involving', 'gangsters', 'shooting', 'theater', 'audience', 'was', 'removed', 'context', 'was', 'rewritten', 'reshot', 'respect', 'horrific', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'delayed', 'original', 'September', 'release', 'Friday', 'unexpected', 'changes', 'film', 'wonderfully.The', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'events', '1948', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'gangster', 'Mickey', 'Cohen', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'establishing', 'foothold', 'city', 'ultimately', 'West', 'Coast', 'opening', 'scene', 'quite', 'clear', 'Cohen', 'will', 'hold', 'nothing', 'back', 'as', 'ruthless', 'evil', 'next', 'scene', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'heroic', 'Sgt', 'John', ""O'Mara"", 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'single-handedly', 'hell', 'Cohen', 'lower', 'level', 'crooks', 'expertly-written', 'screenplay', 'Will', 'Beall', 'introduction', 'meet', 'Sgt', 'Jerry', 'Wooters', 'scene-stealing', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Gosling', 'absolutely', 'show', 'portrayal', 'Wooters', 'will', 'come', 'surprise', 'fans', 'recent', 'roles', 'Drive', 'struggles', 'stop', 'Cohen', 'L.A.P.D', 'Chief', 'Parker', 'Nick', 'Nolte', ""O'Mara"", 'form', 'small', 'squad', 'break', 'Cohen', 'operation', 'apart.The', 'squad', 'delight', 'watch', 'action', 'including', 'minor', 'stumbles', 'way', 'Fleischer', 'keen', 'eye', 'dramatic', 'action', 'even', 'manages', 'bring', 'humorous', 'lighthearted', 'moments', 'Beall', 'script', 'life', 'gangster', 'squad', 'given', 'plenty', 'time', 'develop', 'camaraderie', 'clear', 'function', 'best', 'crew', 'Grace', 'Faraday', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'fresh', 'take', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Stone', 'great', 'role', 'truly', 'ensemble', 'film', 'cast', 'deliver', 'fantastic', 'performances.It', 'shorter', 'film', 'type', 'just', 'shy', 'two', 'hours', 'balanced', 'flow', 'Zombieland-esque', 'slow-motion', 'moments', ""'re"", 'used', 'less', 'cool', 'sequences', 'more', 'reinforce', 'view', 'characters', 'involved', 'who', 'are', 'firing', 'guns', 'rapid-fire', 'time', 'moving', 'apparent', 'slow', 'motion', 'also', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'film', 'feels', 'entirely', 'authentic', 'time', 'period', 'absolutely', 'late', '40', '8242', 's', 'time', 'period', 'L.A.', 'up', 'perfectly', 'other', 'dramas', 'same', 'time', 'Overall', 'fun', 'exciting', 'ride', 'really', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'performances', 'turned', 'out', 'pleasant', 'surprise.Verdict', 'Absolutely', 'see', 'theaters']",Gangster Squad

The DVD had several previews apparently aimed at teenagers, one for a vampire/witch type movie, a video game, an animated movie that looked like a video game. No previews for smart, adult movies. Seems like the studio took this smart and stylish period drama and tried to make it seem like older kids would like it? When it was due to be released the first time in theaters, the Colorado mass theater murders had taken place, and Gangster Squad's release was pushed back. Not sure what happened after that, but it seemed to open and close in theaters without a peep. Many reviews here are negative. I have not read them yet. I like to write my own first.This is a really good period action drama with lots of star power, great acting, fantastic action scenes, and a complex and interesting story. We watched the DVD last night and my husband said a couple of times, ""I love this! It moves so fast!"" (Heads up for those who do not like any violence or gore: there is quite of bit of that. It is fairly stylized and creative, but when it happens, it is gory. There are many killings...this is a movie about crime gangs.)Gangster Squad, based on a book of the same name, and based on a true story of a real crime boss in LA, is rich in period detail, including the final credits on painted ""postcards"" evoking 1940s/1950s Los Angeles landmarks. The plot, in which chiseled-jaw leading man and stand-up guy John (Josh Brolin) decides he can't let the bad guys win, and puts together an all-star squad of law enforcers to clean up LA, reminded me a lot of The Untouchables; you just love the guys, and pull for them, cheering them on.

Corruption was not new to City Leaders, Policemen and Union men however to step outside the law to FIGHT it was.....enter Sgt John O'Mara (Josh Brolin)--former decorated war veteran, hardened by his years in the war and a no-nonsense ethic he applies to his detective position with the LAPD; Sgt Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) content with getting along to insure a pension in 20 years, undergoing a slow realization that in order to enforce the law sometimes one must BREAK the law; Giovanni Ribisi (excellently cast) as the techno-geek officer who improvises listening devices to tap into Cohen's secret plans ; Michael Pena as a rookie cop eager to join up and be part of this team; and Robert Patrick the elder lawman who still holsters an old 6 shooter but with deadly accuracy (obviously not a fan of LAPD's snub .38 service weapon)  We now have the ingredients of Superhero Crime Fighters without the necessity of Miranandizing suspects or calling for the paddy wagon to arrest lawbreakers!  Just as violent and physically abusive as Cohen (darkly and visciously portrayed by Sean Penn) our ensemble of Cops fight ruthlessly to eradicate the grasp of Mickey Cohen and his henchmen in the most bold and intrusive means available.

1502014,A14SRB2VNHKO3J,B005S9ELVC,"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot""","[1, 1]","Gangster Squad was one of those movies that didn't generate a lot of buzz on the movie circuit but had me all hyped up anyway. With a cool premise and all-star studded cast, coupled with the fact that it's supposed to be inspired by true events (a story I'm vaguely familiar with), I figured I was in it for the win. God, I hate it when I'm wrong! Movies that are ""inspired by true events"" should always be followed by a disclaimer that it will play fast and loose with both the historical accuracy and details of the actual story. In all fairness, I really should've should known better.Basically, Gangster Squad is one of those movies that talks the talk but it doesn't walk the walkIt's superficial in that it looks the part but in no way can it run with the big boys. It's all bark and no bite, see. I think you get the point. It actually reminded me a lot of my recent Great Gatsby experience in that the focus seems to be more on the outer surface than the inner core. There's no arguing that it's a beauty to look at --- it's slick and stylised with a neo-noir sort of feel---but the violence is cartoonish, the dialogue hollow and the characters are all parodies of what mobsters and cops should be.And I think that's the thing that surprised me most. We have this amazingly talented cast, yet no one really manages to break out of their stock gangster stereotype. It felt like they were all fighting eachother for the spotlight and the result was that not one of them managed to shine. I guess you really can't do much with a bland character thanks, in part, to poor development and writing. I'd also like to note that the Sean Penn - Emma Stone coupling really creeped me out here. Just... gross. And while we're on the subject of Sean Penn (and his character)--- he's too much. There's too much drama, too much make-up, too much of everything. Sean Penn was way over-the-top with his characterisation of Cohen and hecame off comical, not dangerous. Essentially, he was the embodiment of every stereotypical villainous trait you could think of. Controlling over his woman. Oh yeah. Former boxing champ. Yep. Maniacal laughter. Yep. Cheesy bad-guy quips. Yep. Inefficient henchmen. You betcha. It was near impossible to take him seriously! Even Gosling, who is apparently super choosy about his roles, was less than impressive. Well, as less than impressive as a specimen such as himself can possibly be.This is one of those films you've seen before, only everyone else did it better. Don't let your expectations get the best of you like they did with me. While it's all wrapped up in shiny and pretty packaging, it's totally lacking where it counts the most. Very few movies can pull off being so high on action and artfully shot (i.e. - Drive). Gangster Squad is shooting blanks.Food for Thought: Gangster Squad is a movie loaded with promise and potential but, unfortunately, it fails in the execution. While it's an aesthetically pleasing film to watch, it's predictible. The dialogue borders on cheesy, the characters read as inauthentic and hollow and the villainy is too over-the-top. It's a real shame, given the talent, that no one manages to break the mold. This movie, overall, is unsubstantial and wholly unsatisfying and that makes me sad.",2,Gangster Squad is shooting blanks!,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,3261,"['Gangster', 'Squad', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'generate', 'lot', 'buzz', 'movie', 'circuit', 'had', 'hyped', 'up', 'anyway', 'cool', 'premise', 'all-star', 'studded', 'cast', 'coupled', 'fact', 'supposed', 'be', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'story', ""'m"", 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'figured', 'was', 'win', 'God', 'hate', 'when', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'Movies', 'are', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'followed', 'disclaimer', 'will', 'play', 'fast', 'loose', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'details', 'actual', 'story', 'fairness', 'really', 'should', ""'ve"", 'should', 'known', 'better.Basically', 'Gangster', 'Squad', 'one', 'movies', 'talks', 'talk', ""n't"", 'walk', 'walkIt', 'superficial', 'part', 'way', 'can', 'run', 'big', 'boys', 'bark', 'bite', 'see', 'think', 'get', 'point', 'actually', 'reminded', 'lot', 'recent', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'experience', 'focus', 'be', 'more', 'outer', 'surface', 'inner', 'core', 'arguing', 'beauty', 'look', 'slick', 'stylised', 'neo-noir', 'sort', 'feel', '-but', 'violence', 'cartoonish', 'dialogue', 'hollow', 'characters', 'are', 'parodies', 'what', 'mobsters', 'cops', 'should', 'be.And', 'think', 'thing', 'surprised', 'most', 'have', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'cast', 'yet', 'one', 'really', 'break', 'stock', 'gangster', 'stereotype', 'felt', 'were', 'fighting', 'eachother', 'spotlight', 'result', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'managed', 'shine', 'guess', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'bland', 'character', 'thanks', 'part', 'poor', 'development', 'writing', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'note', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'coupling', 'really', 'creeped', 'here', 'Just', 'gross', ""'re"", 'subject', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'character', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'drama', 'too', 'much', 'make-up', 'too', 'much', 'everything', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'was', 'way', 'over-the-top', 'characterisation', 'Cohen', 'hecame', 'off', 'comical', 'not', 'dangerous', 'Essentially', 'was', 'embodiment', 'stereotypical', 'villainous', 'trait', 'could', 'think', 'Controlling', 'woman', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Former', 'boxing', 'champ', 'Yep', 'Maniacal', 'laughter', 'Yep', 'Cheesy', 'bad-guy', 'quips', 'Yep', 'Inefficient', 'henchmen', 'betcha', 'was', 'near', 'impossible', 'take', 'seriously', 'Even', 'Gosling', 'who', 'apparently', 'super', 'choosy', 'roles', 'was', 'less', 'impressive', 'Well', 'less', 'impressive', 'specimen', 'such', 'can', 'possibly', 'be.This', 'one', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'only', 'everyone', 'else', 'did', 'better', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'expectations', 'get', 'best', 'did', 'wrapped', 'up', 'shiny', 'pretty', 'packaging', 'totally', 'lacking', 'where', 'most', 'Very', 'few', 'movies', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'being', 'so', 'high', 'action', 'artfully', 'shot', 'i.e', 'Drive', 'Gangster', 'Squad', 'shooting', 'blanks.Food', 'Thought', 'Gangster', 'Squad', 'movie', 'loaded', 'promise', 'potential', 'unfortunately', 'execution', 'aesthetically', 'pleasing', 'film', 'watch', 'predictible', 'dialogue', 'borders', 'cheesy', 'characters', 'read', 'inauthentic', 'hollow', 'villainy', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'real', 'shame', 'given', 'talent', 'one', 'break', 'mold', 'movie', 'overall', 'unsubstantial', 'wholly', 'unsatisfying', 'sad']",Gangster Squad

It's a mess on nearly every level. Sometimes movie projects have all the right chemistry and promise on paper, but miss the mark by a great margin. Others miss the mark by leaps and bounds such as De Palma's crap ridden horrible stinker 'The black Dahlia', which is a tormenting film to sit through in every conceivable way. Then you have this movie that is so bad you have to gauge it by something much worse like the Black Dahlia in which to even measure anything good about it. How this film got 3 and 4 star reviews is anyone's geuss. I'm still scratching my head. It appears everything was in place for this to have become a big hit of the year. An A list of solid actors, an interesting true story and a good budget. But the fault clearly lays squarely upon the backs of bad planning, a terrible script and horrible direction. Nick Nolte's performance alone is worth seeing for it's unintentional comic qualities, Penn is actually quite good at times, and others seems lost and hasn't a clue what to do with the s*** script he's had to waddle through. Gosling is wooden as hell, as is Josh Brolin, who is sadly just as wooden. Everyone else is as well. So far this is the worst movie I've seen all year.

Cohen was a scourge in LA for many years, but the creation of a special gangster squad as portrayed in the film is totally fictional. Fiction or no, the plot premise is excellent; but sadly descends into mediocrity, due to some very weak writing and poor direction by Robert Fleischer, who is mostly known for his comic films and is in over his head in this genre. That's a shame, because with the powerhouse cast it could have been so much better. Sean Penn delivers a fine performance as Cohen...few can portray a crime lord with the cold villainy of Penn and he doesn't disappoint. Other notable cast members include Josh Brolin as Sgt O'Hara; Nick Nolte as the Police Chief; Brian Gosling, Robert Patrick and Giovanni Ribisi as a key members of the squad; and Emma Stone as Cohen's moll and Gosling's love interest. Their characters are mostly undeveloped; and the beautiful and talented Stone is essentially wasted.

And that's just for starters.Set in 1949 Los Angeles, this low-rent version of ""L.A. Confidential"" mixed with ""The Untouchables"" is based on the true-life account of Mickey Cohen, a Chicago mobster who's using prostitution, drug running and gambling as a means of building his own empire on the west coast. Trouble is, in the process, he's managed to not only alienate his former partners back in the Midwest but to fire up law enforcement in L.A. (those not already in his back pocket, that is) who feel that he will soon take over the city if he isn't stopped.Enter homicide detective Sergeant John O'Mara, an upstanding Irish war hero who's been assigned the unenviable task of driving Cohen out of business by whatever means necessary. This involves gathering together a merry band of like-minded, trustworthy individuals (the ""gangster squad"") who'll help him do the job. But how far outside of the law are they willing to go to bring about their desired end?As directed by Ruben Fleischer, ""Gangster Squad"" could not possibly feel more halfhearted, enervating and hackneyed at this stage in movie history. The screenplay by Will Beall is practically an encyclopedia of mob movie stereotypes and cliches, and the dialogue and voice-over narration are often jaw-dropping in their banality.Sean Penn scowls his way through the part of Cohen, while Josh Brolin, as O'Mara, sleepwalks through his. Ditto for Ryan Gosling, Nick Nolte, Emma Stone and ""The Killing's"" Mireille Enos, whose roles here are unworthy of their not inconsiderable talents.With so many fine crime dramas floating around, both in movies and on TV, there's really no reason to settle for so thoroughly generic an offering as ""Gangster Squad.""",2,utterly generic mob movie,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,1858,"['first', 'five', 'minutes', 'Gangster', 'Squad', 'one', 'man', 'torn', 'half', 'midsection', 'hand', 'lopped', 'off', 'elevator', 'just', 'starters.Set', '1949', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'low-rent', 'version', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'mixed', 'Untouchables', 'based', 'true-life', 'account', 'Mickey', 'Cohen', 'Chicago', 'mobster', 'who', 'using', 'prostitution', 'drug', 'running', 'gambling', 'means', 'building', 'own', 'empire', 'west', 'coast', 'Trouble', 'process', 'managed', 'not', 'only', 'alienate', 'former', 'partners', 'back', 'Midwest', 'fire', 'up', 'law', 'enforcement', 'L.A.', 'not', 'already', 'back', 'pocket', 'who', 'feel', 'will', 'soon', 'take', 'over', 'city', ""n't"", 'stopped.Enter', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Sergeant', 'John', ""O'Mara"", 'upstanding', 'Irish', 'war', 'hero', 'who', 'been', 'assigned', 'unenviable', 'task', 'driving', 'Cohen', 'business', 'means', 'necessary', 'gathering', 'together', 'merry', 'band', 'like-minded', 'trustworthy', 'individuals', 'gangster', 'squad', 'who', ""'ll"", 'help', 'do', 'job', 'how', 'far', 'law', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'bring', 'about', 'desired', 'end', 'directed', 'Ruben', 'Fleischer', 'Gangster', 'Squad', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'feel', 'more', 'halfhearted', 'enervating', 'hackneyed', 'stage', 'movie', 'history', 'screenplay', 'Will', 'Beall', 'practically', 'encyclopedia', 'mob', 'movie', 'stereotypes', 'cliches', 'dialogue', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'are', 'often', 'jaw-dropping', 'banality.Sean', 'Penn', 'way', 'part', 'Cohen', 'Josh', 'Brolin', ""O'Mara"", 'Ditto', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Killing', 'Mireille', 'Enos', 'roles', 'here', 'are', 'unworthy', 'not', 'inconsiderable', 'talents.With', 'so', 'many', 'fine', 'crime', 'dramas', 'floating', 'around', 'movies', 'TV', 'really', 'reason', 'settle', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'generic', 'offering', 'Gangster', 'Squad']",Gangster Squad

Sean Penn is miscast as Mickey Cohen, overacts, and looks ridiculous in gangster makeup.  Nick Nolte as the police chief also does his share of mugging.  Ryan Gosling plays a cop with little by way of dramatic range.  The plot is fairly predictable.  The good guys interdict and destroy some of Cohen's drug shipments and his wire service gambling operation, and put a wiretap on his place.  The art direction and action sequences are generally good.  The film culminates in a massive gun battle between a virtual army of Cohen henchmen holed up in a swanky hotel and the members of the Gangster Squad.  The script is serviceable but quite predictable, at times a bit hackneyed.  Overall, the enterprise has a sort of cops-and-robbers simplistic air about it.

The manner in which the Thompson machine guns was almost as absurd as Schwartzeneger in Predator. Those weapons were typically held sideways so the incredible recoil would work to spray an area. Handling them with one in each hand like a small caliber handgun in this movie was silly, but I suppose it was OK for those looking to escape into the violence of the era.The movie started out saying &#34;inspired by a true story&#34;, but the final lines claiming that such actions helped insure that LA never be infiltrated by the gangs was just ridiculous and seemed like they were trying to make it sound like the movie was &#34;based upon a true story,&#34; not inspired.

1502055,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B005S9ELVC,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[1, 2]","Warner Bros. is a studio with a long and flavorful association with the gangster genre that dates back almost to the advent of sound pictures with enduring classics such as the Public Enemy, Little Caesar, White Heat and my personal favorite the Petrified Forest, continuing up to the modern era with the seminal Bonnie and Clyde and more contemporary movies such as Goodfellas, Heat, L.A. Confidential and Martin Scorsese's  Best Picture Oscar winning the Departed. While Ruben Fleischer's Gangster Squad most likely wont be joining the immortals, it is a fun and excessively exciting throwback to days of yore when the silver screen glistened with stars who could easily be identified by single names such as Bogie, Eddie G. or Cagney.Set in the post-war Las Angels of 1949, with a handsome production design by Mather Ahmad and the best cinematography any pulp action movie could ask for, provided by Dion Beebe. Beebe, an Oscar winner for Memoirs of a Geisha, but also the DP on the nourish tinged Collateral, Equilibrium and the motion picture of Miami Vice, here his camerawork is thrillingly and engulfing, every review I have read singles out his splendid work with significant praise, even the negative reviews.Praised as well critized with equal measure for it's highly stylized, often  flamboyant style of filmmaking. The movie plays successfully as a loving homage to the gangster classics it wants to immolate. The story maybe similar in ways to Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential, but it is actually a completely different animal aiming for the more low brow visually pleasing pulp of classic Warner gangsters. As such, I feel it is very successful, as I'm sure most will as long as they go in thinking more of Dick Tracy than Don Vito Corleone, or maybe just Al Pacino as Scarface with a slightly more colorful palette. Call it cartoonish cool.The plot involving a magnificent group of seven L.A. cops trying to take down the racket of mobster Mickey Cohen. Will recall the Untouchables and my pick for the best movie of the last fifteen years, the already mentioned L.A. Confidential. It's not in their league, but if you are inclined for this sort of pulverize entertainment, you wont be disappointed. The screenplay by Will Beall is chocked full of ostentatious hard boiled tough guy dialogue, based on a book by Paul Lieberman, it is Beall's first filmed movie script, but he is the author of the as-yet unfilmed ""Lethal Weapon 5"" and the ""Logan's Run"" redsux, at least judging from his work here it gives high hopes for those possible future projects. Yes, the story is familiar, obvious and filled with clich&eacute;s, but I am not entirely uncertain that is not it's aim.Director Fleischer is a great stylist if not a great moviemaker, as the director behind the excellent and cheerfully cheeky Zombieland, but also the dismal 30 Minutes or Less, Fleischer does exhibit a wonderful visual flair which he puts to good use here in this highly visual movie.It would be nearly impossible however not to discuss the exceptional cast of Gangster Squad. Beginning with Josh Brolin in full leading man command, a fully watch able talent and likeable movie star all before getting to the fact that he is a first rate actor. All the same praise can be heaped on Ryan Gosling ten fold, it's amazing watching him play tough because he doesn't look like a bad ass, but is able pull it off on the sheer strength of his performance. I would hate to see him bogged down in action roles as he is such a great actor, probably the best of his generation, but after the exquisite Drive and the forthcoming A Place Beyond the Pines and Only God Forgives, he seems to be choosing his roles very well even in the sometimes limited action movie genre.The rest of the gagster squad is fleshed out by top notch character performers such as the veteran Robert Patrick, Michael Pena coming off a star making turn in the excellent cop drama End of Watch, Giovanni Ribisi and Anthony Mackie with Nick Nolte as the chief of police.Nolte seems to be aging like a rock, he looks like solid brick and his rhapsitty voice is only getting deeper and more gruff, as an actor he could drive fear into your heart at 71 years old with just one scowl and when he declares that this ""isn`t a crime wave, it/`s enemy occupation"" you believe what he has to say. Patrick himself a long dependable character star, is offered his best role since his breakthrough of Terminator 2: Judgment Day some twenty-two years earlier, as an old gunslinger who prefers a six shooter to the more contemporary tommy gun.Emma Stone is a nice surprise, sultry and with the classic good looks meet style that recall starlets of yesteryear, particularly Lauren Bacall and other classic movie femme fatales of the silver screen past.However, make no mistake this is Sean Penn's movie. Giving an electrifying performance as Mickey Cohen who happily declares that this ""the wild ****ing west"""", aas the ex-boxer turned  gangster Penn gives the movie it`s meat and it`s center. It may not be a historically accurate portrayal of the man, but it is one that wont soon be forgotten. If there is anything that elevates Gangster Squad close to greatness it is Penn's performance, a richly textured evil that reminds us every time he's onscreen why this is a gangster picture and not a cop movie.As well known for their gangster and crime films as Universal was for their monsters and MGM for their musicals, the classic Warner Bros. tradition, unlike those others still survives and waves it's flag high and proud, and while Gangster Squad probably wont win any Oscars or be highly regarded in years to come, it is a satisfactory slice of juicy pulp fiction to sustain us until their next classic rollsout.read my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",4,satisfying slice of juicy pulp fiction,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,5794,"['Warner', 'Bros.', 'studio', 'long', 'flavorful',

The action takes place in 1949/1950 and is not shot in black and white. Combat veteran Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) is asked to form a squad of elite men to take down Mickey Cohen, but not as cops, but as a gangsters hitting his places one by one.John has a pregnant wife (Mireille Enos) who would rather leave town than have her husband take on the mobster. Saddled with the fact it won't happen, she helps her husband assemble a squad which includes Jerry (Ryan Gosling) a playboy cop who is seeing Mickey's girlfriend (Emma Stone). Emma Stone has played too many down to earth women to pull off a swanky mobster girl. She looked like a kid who was playing in her mommy's make-up box. Perhaps that was the genius of the film as she was to suppose to be a small town girl out of place.Jerry uses a pick up line from 1941 comedy ""Hold That Ghost"" when he talks about playing post office. Again, was this bad writing or would have someone used a line from a film? At times the characters acted like they came out of ""Sin City,"" stereotypes of themselves. Where do they get all these new Packards to shoot up?The film had some good lines such as Sean Penn: ""All good things must one day be burnt to the ground for insurance money."" There is enough humor in the film to keep it from becoming dry.Now the bad news is that Mickey Cohen was actually brought down by the IRS and not the gangster squad. His girlfriend Liz (not Grace)did three years because she wouldn't testify against him. So as far as facts go, rate this well below an Oliver Stone film.

You'll sit there and watch if you know what's good for ya!"" Next thing you know, there's a guy getting ripped in half, just so you get the message. Mickey Cohen is the guy who sends that telegram, and he's played by Sean Penn who met `the top' one day and decided to go over it, way over it. Just so we're clear though, that's just what's needed to make Gangster Squad tick.Cohen owns LA, but goody-two-shoes Sgt. O'Mara (Josh Brolin) has other plans for the City of Angels. He's had enough of this sucker's drug running, cop buying, and lady trafficking and looks to put an end to it. Problem is, his bird needs a husband not a hero, and what's more - she's got company on the way (baby O'Mara). Off the books, Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) says O'Mara's got to round up a squad Ocean's Eleven style complete with tough guy Rocky Washington (Anthony Mackie), tech-man Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi), sharp shooter Max Kennard (Robert Patrick), and sidekick Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena). Not to mention Wildman Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) who's ""poaching the king's deer"" in that he's got an eye on Mickey's girl Grace (Emma Stone).What follows is a ride through the gritty, pulpy landscape of post-war LA, where knuckleheads get what's coming to them if they step out of line. Jerry's moves on Mickey's dame put O'Mara's operation in some hot water, and a cat and mouse chase commences. When it comes to Gangster Squad, you know the drill: operations go south on account that a runt up and turned rat on a guy, tensions swell when a thug drops the dime on his boss, and emotions flare every time a broad bends her arm for another gent. It ain't Chinatown, but it's got a scene that takes place there. Point is, this is entertaining and while critically it may be a bust, here's a fun ride with an expert cast that delivers the goods...with a few bumps and bruises.

1502079,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B005S9ELVC,Todd Smith,"[117, 126]","This film has received many bad reviews, but not because it's a bad movie. The truth is it's just not what people expected it to be. When you hear about a mafia movie, you expect an epic, inside look like with Goodfellas or Casino, but Gangster Squad is from the cops point of view and more like The Untouchables. Gangster Squad is based on a novel and is about an off the books LAPD operation aimed at bringing down Micky Cohen. In the 1940s, LA had a growing mafia problem on it's hands, and Mickey Cohen was set to become the next Al Capone. Unbeknownst for decades, the LAPD sent a group of cops, who didn't play by the book, after Cohen and by going after his business interests, they attempt to destroy his growing empire. The story is a great one, well deserving of a film adaptation, but what people didn't like was how it turned into an action film. This story has all the makings of an epic mafia drama, an you will be hard pressed to find a better performance than the one Sean Penn gives as Mickey Cohen. It was somewhat disappointing that they didn't get more into Cohen and his operation, but for what it was, it was a great film. As for the cast, it features some of Hollywood's best an brightest as old school meets the up and coming stars of the big screen. Every one from the stars to the ancillary characters give Oscar worthy performances that will be sadly overlooked. because of the nature of the film.

Directed by Ruben Fleischer, best known for his joyful and unpredictable ""Zombieland,"" the crime action drama lacks originality in spite of the beautiful photography and great cast including Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Nick Nolte, Robert Patrick, Michael Pe&ntilde;a, Sean Penn, Giovanni Ribisi and Emma Stone.Though ""Gangster Squad"" features several real-life figures such as police sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) and a gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), the storyline and episodes are mostly fictional. Some may criticize the film for its clich&eacute;d story and typecast characters, but the fast-paced film is not boring thanks to the fine performances form the cast, impressive period details and gorgeous photography by Dion Beebe (""Chicago"" ""Memoirs of a Geisha"").What the film needs is more intense conflict between O'Mara and Cohen. Interactions between the squad members are also weak. Generally speaking, if action sequences are not very thrilling, it is because audiences just don't care what is going to happen to these uninteresting characters.It is reported that the film was re-shot because of the 2012 Colorado shooting.

The movie gives you just enough history to understand why Cohen was a big threat to California and why this tiny underdog team is basically on a suicide mission.  The protagonists are real men doing what needs to be done for no thanks, no credit, no money, no support, and no guarantee of success.  These are plain, rough, good guys facing off against a literal army of deeply scummy bad guys.The actors are all superb.  Not one of the characters is played by a poor performer.  Even the goons on Cohen's payroll, the cops, and the minor players are faces you've seen before.  Penn is an enthralling evil and accurate gangster.  Not over-the-top, as some have complained.  He is frightening, unpredictable, and thoroughly evil.  A genuine threat at all times.  No dumby.  He's a cleverly evil guy with a big ego.  The Gangster Squad is a group of heroes, each very different from the other.  It is clear who is who and what is driving each guy.  The movie does not have one flawed actor.  Incredible performances keep you tied to the story.The plot is full of realistic twists, character flaws, mistakes made by good guys and bad guys alike, thrilling action scenes, hit and run missions, and a final confrontation that is worth watching a few times.Frankly, I wish we had a few Gangster Squads in America today.  This movie was a clear good versus evil flick based on reality.  The characters are all gray, yet lovable.  What an unexpectedly fun movie!
