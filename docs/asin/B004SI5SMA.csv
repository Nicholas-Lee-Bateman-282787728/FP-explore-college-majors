1427373,A1I61T0VRK0JKQ,B004SI5SMA,BarryChamplain,"[5, 9]","I want to start this review off with a little info about myself. I am a 23 year old male. I am from the US and never seen and will likely never care to watch the original UK version of Skins. So, please hold all of the negative comments about my review if you're going to freak out about the original being better, Americans ruining things, blah blah...This show came to my attention when MTV started running ads for it that featured Michelle telling her mom that she was going out to study. Her Mom of course doesn't believe her and seems not to care. She then ends up at a party with a bunch of the other characters. From this ad alone, I felt that the show would be quite predictable. I also read a few articles online and in Rolling Stone magazine talking about how risque the show was supposed to be and all of the uproar that it was causing. Well, I set all of the episodes to record, week after week, never watching any of them from my PVR (TiVo). Finally, about 4 or 5 episodes in, with nothing else to watch, I decided to dig into the series.As far as my prediction that the show would be predictable, other than the fact that there is a lot of sex and drugs, I was wrong. It hit me as being much more deeper than I expected. The thing that strikes me most, and is possibly the reason that parent groups and other ""holier than thou"" types were against the show, was that it is very honest and straightforward. Sure, the kids in the series are not kids that lived like me at that age, but the fact is, I did know people like that when I was in school. The type of kids who are disconnected from their family, raise themselves and turn to sex, partying, drugs and the like are very much alive and well in modern day America. Many kids also battle with mental issues, domestic and mental abuse at home, low self esteem and trying to find themselves. It's really what the teen years are about for most people. Learning how to deal with life. Underneath all of the issues, the characters all show their own kind of loyalty, honesty, confidence and forgiveness in different situations.I will not give away any info about the characters or give away the story lines. I will say that if you're at all interested, want to get beyond all of the negative press perpetuated by Christian Family Groups and UK haters, this series is definitely worth a look. Please watch all episodes in order. Learn about each character in depth, learn about them all as a group and you'll likely appreciate this entertaining and well-done look at kids coming of age in the modern day.MTV made a mistake caving into negative pressure and pulling the plug on one of their best shows in years! It's sad that anything positive and creative that isn't ""reality"" (Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, Cribs, The ""Real"" World) is thrown out by them these days. I guess they feel like their main audience doesn't have the mental capacity to understand and appreciate a good series. Well, they are probably right.I would like to congratulate the creators, writers, producers and the cast of the MTV Skins on a job well done. Sorry the idiots decided to dump a good show. Good luck in your future endeavors.I will own this on DVD someday when the price comes down. It's just that well done that I know I will want to watch it many more times over the years.",5,A great show that never got a chance to grow,1311465600,"07 24, 2011",2011,3314,"['want', 'start', 'review', 'little', 'info', 'am', '23', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'am', 'US', 'never', 'seen', 'will', 'likely', 'never', 'care', 'watch', 'original', 'UK', 'version', 'Skins', 'So', 'please', 'hold', 'negative', 'comments', 'review', ""'re"", 'going', 'freak', 'out', 'original', 'being', 'better', 'Americans', 'ruining', 'things', 'blah', 'blah', 'show', 'came', 'attention', 'when', 'MTV', 'started', 'running', 'ads', 'featured', 'Michelle', 'telling', 'mom', 'was', 'going', 'study', 'Mom', 'course', ""n't"", 'believe', 'not', 'care', 'then', 'up', 'party', 'bunch', 'other', 'characters', 'ad', 'alone', 'felt', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'predictable', 'also', 'read', 'few', 'articles', 'online', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'magazine', 'talking', 'how', 'risque', 'show', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'uproar', 'was', 'causing', 'Well', 'set', 'episodes', 'record', 'week', 'week', 'never', 'watching', 'PVR', 'TiVo', 'Finally', 'about', '4', '5', 'episodes', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch', 'decided', 'dig', 'series.As', 'far', 'prediction', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'predictable', 'other', 'fact', 'lot', 'sex', 'drugs', 'was', 'wrong', 'hit', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'deeper', 'expected', 'thing', 'most', 'possibly', 'reason', 'parent', 'groups', 'other', 'holier', 'thou', 'types', 'were', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'honest', 'straightforward', 'Sure', 'kids', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'kids', 'lived', 'age', 'fact', 'did', 'know', 'people', 'when', 'was', 'school', 'type', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'disconnected', 'family', 'raise', 'turn', 'sex', 'partying', 'drugs', 'like', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'well', 'modern', 'day', 'America', 'Many', 'kids', 'also', 'battle', 'mental', 'issues', 'domestic', 'mental', 'abuse', 'home', 'low', 'self', 'esteem', 'trying', 'find', 'really', 'what', 'teen', 'years', 'are', 'most', 'people', 'Learning', 'how', 'deal', 'life', 'issues', 'characters', 'show', 'own', 'kind', 'loyalty', 'honesty', 'confidence', 'forgiveness', 'different', 'situations.I', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'info', 'characters', 'give', 'away', 'story', 'lines', 'will', 'say', ""'re"", 'interested', 'want', 'get', 'negative', 'press', 'perpetuated', 'Christian', 'Family', 'Groups', 'UK', 'haters', 'series', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'Please', 'watch', 'episodes', 'order', 'Learn', 'character', 'depth', 'learn', 'group', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'appreciate', 'entertaining', 'well-done', 'look', 'kids', 'coming', 'age', 'modern', 'day.MTV', 'made', 'mistake', 'caving', 'negative', 'pressure', 'pulling', 'plug', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'years', 'sad', 'anything', 'positive', 'creative', ""n't"", 'reality', 'Jersey', 'Shore', 'Teen', 'Mom', 'Cribs', 'Real', 'World', 'thrown', 'out', 'days', 'guess', 'feel', 'main', 'audience', ""n't"", 'have', 'mental', 'capacity', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'good', 'series', 'Well', 'are', 'probably', 'right.I', 'would', 'like', 'congratulate', 'creators', 'writers', 'producers', 'cast', 'MTV', 'Skins', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'Sorry', 'idiots', 'decided', 'dump', 'good', 'show', 'Good', 'luck', 'future', 'endeavors.I', 'will', 'own', 'DVD', 'someday', 'when', 'price', 'down', 'just', 'that', 'well', 'done', 'know', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'years']",N/A

I think one thing we can definitively say is that it wasn't the British version, no matter how hard it sometimes tried to be.First, I didn't hate it. I liked a lot of it, but there was a lot that really needed work. Several of the characters were more interesting than their UK counterparts (Caddie and Tea most notably), but there were many others that I just didn't care for, Tony chief among them. What in the British version had been a character was ruthless, manipulative and very intelligent became in the American version a fairly whiny, petulant little boy who got cranky when he couldn't hook up with the lesbian girl as often as he wanted. Most of the characters, though, I felt toward pretty much the same as I did with the UK characters. Michelle, Daisy, Stanley... none of them were notably different enough to really get my attention one way or the other as comparisons go and I suppose that's an ok thing.As for the stories, well... they were usually fairly good when they weren't just adaptations of the UK stories. When the show went into original territory, like with Tea's episode, it proved it could do a really good job. The adaptation episodes, especially the finale, just did not hold up, though the Canadian trip episode was original enough compared with the Russian counterpart that it still came out good.I will say that at least I liked this season better than I did series three and four of the UK version. This show at least has spared us Freddy and Effy's stupid love affair.Overall I liked this season enough to want to have a second one. MTV hasn't said there will be one, and since they didn't have the decency to end the season on a cliffhanger nearly as impressive as what they did with the first series in the UK, I'm inclined to doubt there will be. But there was one thing that they did do that amused me, in that just like the British version it at least ended with music, though Tears for Fears rather than Cat Stevens.",3,"Watchable, but it could have been so much better.",1301270400,"03 28, 2011",2011,2121,"['ended', 'not', 'bang', 'not', 'whimper', 'shout.Yes', 'season', 'one', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'only', 'season', 'MTV', 'airs', 'show', 'finished', 'think', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'definitively', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'British', 'version', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'sometimes', 'tried', 'be.First', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'liked', 'lot', 'there', 'was', 'lot', 'really', 'needed', 'work', 'Several', 'characters', 'were', 'more', 'interesting', 'UK', 'counterparts', 'Caddie', 'Tea', 'most', 'notably', 'were', 'many', 'others', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Tony', 'chief', 'What', 'British', 'version', 'had', 'been', 'character', 'was', 'ruthless', 'manipulative', 'very', 'intelligent', 'became', 'American', 'version', 'fairly', 'whiny', 'petulant', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'got', 'cranky', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'hook', 'up', 'lesbian', 'girl', 'as', 'often', 'wanted', 'Most', 'characters', 'felt', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'did', 'UK', 'characters', 'Michelle', 'Daisy', 'Stanley', 'none', 'were', 'notably', 'different', 'enough', 'really', 'get', 'attention', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'comparisons', 'go', 'suppose', 'ok', 'thing.As', 'stories', 'well', 'were', 'usually', 'fairly', 'good', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'just', 'adaptations', 'UK', 'stories', 'When', 'show', 'went', 'original', 'territory', 'Tea', 'episode', 'proved', 'could', 'do', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'adaptation', 'especially', 'finale', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'Canadian', 'trip', 'episode', 'was', 'original', 'enough', 'compared', 'Russian', 'counterpart', 'still', 'came', 'out', 'good.I', 'will', 'say', 'least', 'liked', 'season', 'better', 'did', 'series', 'three', 'four', 'UK', 'version', 'show', 'least', 'spared', 'Freddy', 'Effy', 'stupid', 'affair.Overall', 'liked', 'season', 'enough', 'want', 'have', 'second', 'one', 'MTV', ""n't"", 'said', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'decency', 'end', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'nearly', 'as', 'impressive', 'what', 'did', 'first', 'series', 'UK', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'do', 'amused', 'just', 'British', 'version', 'least', 'ended', 'music', 'Tears', 'Fears', 'rather', 'Cat', 'Stevens']",N/A

Between the atrocious acting and casting of the leads, the whitewashed dialogue, tame sex and drugs compared to the original UK version of Skins, plus the lack of wit, irony and pathos of the original show, this ranks as one of the biggest failures of recent years of ""remade"" overseas exports. They chose to put an American (Canadian) spin on a show which was SO ground breaking and surreal and brilliant and, let's face it, the original would have been an NC-17 in movie theaters in the US, if released at all considering they were all real teens 14-18, using drugs and getting naked. That just isn't acceptable or legal in the USA. To make matters worse, it's 90% exact same characters, plot, dialogue and story lines, minus the brilliance.With sponsors having bowed out by the truckloads, and ratings sunk, let's hope this bland little train wreck is quickly swept under the carpet, and MTV starts airing the original UK version UNCUT for all to see, but the corporations won't let that happen.",1,"Watered down, bland copy of the UK Original on a DVR",1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,1075,"['think', 'actually', 'fitting', 'only', 'being', 'manufactured', 'DVR', 'atrocious', 'acting', 'casting', 'leads', 'whitewashed', 'dialogue', 'tame', 'sex', 'drugs', 'compared', 'original', 'UK', 'version', 'Skins', 'lack', 'wit', 'irony', 'pathos', 'original', 'show', 'one', 'biggest', 'failures', 'recent', 'years', 'remade', 'overseas', 'exports', 'chose', 'put', 'American', 'Canadian', 'spin', 'show', 'was', 'SO', 'ground', 'breaking', 'surreal', 'brilliant', 'let', 'face', 'original', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'NC-17', 'movie', 'theaters', 'US', 'released', 'considering', 'were', 'real', 'teens', '14-18', 'using', 'drugs', 'getting', 'naked', 'just', ""n't"", 'acceptable', 'legal', 'USA', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', '90', '%', 'exact', 'same', 'characters', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'story', 'lines', 'brilliance.With', 'sponsors', 'having', 'bowed', 'out', 'truckloads', 'ratings', 'sunk', 'let', 'hope', 'bland', 'little', 'train', 'wreck', 'quickly', 'swept', 'carpet', 'MTV', 'airing', 'original', 'UK', 'version', 'UNCUT', 'see', 'corporations', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'happen']",N/A
