But I found the description of &#34;House of Black Wings&#34; highly reminiscent of Lovecraft's &#34;The Music of Erich Zann.&#34; Even the flaws mentioned in the more critical reviews reinforce this impression. It's a story that sometimes drags on a bit too much, sometimes gets a little to pretentious, and occasionally just doesn't seem to make any sense outside its author's mind (all flaws that appear more or less frequently throughout HPL's career); nevertheless, there's an undeniably creepy quality that definitely leaves an impression.So can anyone who's seen it confirm whether this is a case of re-titling, re-setting, and superficially altering the characters, but essentially making a more-or-less faithful literary adaptation? Or is it just an assortment of stylistic elements more inspired by Lovecraft's work in general?",3,"""Kate Stone"" = Erich Zann?

1355951,A391AS877NJKUB,B003NX7EEQ,"G. Smith ""Egghead""","[5, 6]","I think this film has received a lot of unjust criticism.  Not many people have even the slightest clue what it's like to make a movie, and while the reviews here may touch on valid points, they come down too hard on what is a pretty well done amateur movie.  This is not ""amateur"" in the perverted, modern sense, where no one involved had any idea what they were doing, but in the sense that these people pursued the movie for the joy of the art.  Though its shortfalls would keep me from recommending it as a ""good"" flick, I think it deserves praise and a viewing from anyone who is interested in independent films.The film's strongest point is in its technical execution.  The direction was mostly very clear, as was the audio.  I felt that I knew what was happening in any given scene, which is a fundamental skill for any director, but not one that comes naturally by any means (some films with an ""After Dark"" budget manage to screw this up).  The actors did well across the board to carry their characters through the film, though they didn't have much material to work with.  Also, there were few special effects employed in the entire film - I applaud this, as the movie would have completely lost its charm as soon as a hoard of CG monsters came crawling out of the wall or a ghostly shade tore violently through the building in a chase scene.  The supernatural elements are fairly subtle, and that works to enhance the mood.  The setting, plot and sets were all great, and the ending managed a fair amount of tension.Where the film falls short is in the writing.  The story wants to be very character driven, but halfway through the film I still didn't feel like I knew the characters at all.  Robyn is an artist, Kate is a heartbroken musician and they are good friends.  Beyond that, I can't say I know anything about any of the characters.  I get that Robyn was frustrated and struggling, but mostly from the product description.  She seemed to have mood swings, but she also seemed well adjusted.  Kate was sad, but trying to get back on her feet.  What were their plans?  They had immediate goals and convenient feelings, but I couldn't tell why they thought anything.  Will, it seems, was gay, but had nothing else to offer. These beings didn't have fears or loves or world views, they were just temporary characters in a temporary setting.  The story's supernatural antagonists were also ambiguous.  What did the ghosts want?  What did the other-worldly creatures do?  Why did any of them do anything at all?  I didn't understand the conflict and so it was hard for me to care about anything at all.  Unfortunately,  though I never felt like turning the film off, this did translate into confusion and boredom at times.Other concerns were the atmosphere and the music.  Though I think it's better to leave out visual effects rather than allow them to completely ruin a movie, it would have helped to know more how the scenes felt rather that just looked.  The end did a better job of this than the rest, but it's hard to feel anxiety about a room that is well lit or a dream sequence that's just a foggy, dark stage.  The music wasn't bad itself, it worked pretty well, in fact.  I just feel that there was too much music, which also killed the mood of the film.It's hard for me to commit to either recommending this film or not.  On the one hand, I think it was well executed for what it is, and people who enjoy the technical side of media creation (like me), would appreciate this film.  If what you want is a good scare or some great characters to hold on to (most people), I couldn't honestly tell you that you'll enjoy it.  But if you do watch this and don't enjoy it, at least give credit where it's due.  This isn't just good for an independent horror movie, this is far better than many big budget films I've seen and even some highly rated independents.  It just happens that this small crew with limited resources couldn't do the hardest thing to do in movie making.",3,A half-baked idea done well,1336262400,"05 6, 2012",2012,3995,"['think', 'film', 'received', 'lot', 'unjust', 'criticism', 'Not', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'even', 'slightest', 'clue', 'what', 'make', 'movie', 'reviews', 'here', 'may', 'touch', 'valid', 'points', 'come', 'down', 'too', 'hard', 'what', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'amateur', 'movie', 'not', 'amateur', 'perverted', 'modern', 'sense', 'where', 'one', 'involved', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'sense', 'people', 'pursued', 'movie', 'joy', 'art', 'shortfalls', 'would', 'keep', 'recommending', 'good', 'flick', 'think', 'praise', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'independent', 'films.The', 'film', 'strongest', 'point', 'technical', 'execution', 'direction', 'was', 'mostly', 'very', 'clear', 'was', 'audio', 'felt', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'given', 'scene', 'fundamental', 'skill', 'director', 'not', 'one', 'naturally', 'means', 'films', 'Dark', 'budget', 'manage', 'screw', 'up', 'actors', 'did', 'well', 'board', 'carry', 'characters', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'material', 'work', 'Also', 'were', 'few', 'special', 'effects', 'employed', 'entire', 'film', 'applaud', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'completely', 'lost', 'charm', 'as', 'soon', 'hoard', 'CG', 'monsters', 'came', 'crawling', 'wall', 'ghostly', 'shade', 'tore', 'violently', 'building', 'chase', 'scene', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'are', 'fairly', 'subtle', 'enhance', 'mood', 'setting', 'plot', 'sets', 'were', 'great', 'ending', 'managed', 'fair', 'amount', 'tension.Where', 'film', 'short', 'writing', 'story', 'be', 'very', 'character', 'driven', 'halfway', 'film', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'knew', 'characters', 'Robyn', 'artist', 'Kate', 'heartbroken', 'musician', 'are', 'good', 'friends', 'Beyond', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'know', 'anything', 'characters', 'get', 'Robyn', 'was', 'frustrated', 'struggling', 'mostly', 'product', 'description', 'seemed', 'have', 'mood', 'swings', 'also', 'seemed', 'well', 'adjusted', 'Kate', 'was', 'sad', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'feet', 'What', 'were', 'plans', 'had', 'immediate', 'goals', 'convenient', 'feelings', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'why', 'thought', 'anything', 'Will', 'was', 'gay', 'had', 'nothing', 'else', 'offer', 'beings', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'fears', 'loves', 'world', 'views', 'were', 'just', 'temporary', 'characters', 'temporary', 'setting', 'story', 'supernatural', 'antagonists', 'were', 'also', 'ambiguous', 'What', 'did', 'ghosts', 'want', 'What', 'did', 'other-worldly', 'creatures', 'do', 'Why', 'did', 'do', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'conflict', 'was', 'hard', 'care', 'anything', 'Unfortunately', 'never', 'felt', 'turning', 'film', 'off', 'did', 'translate', 'confusion', 'boredom', 'times.Other', 'concerns', 'were', 'atmosphere', 'music', 'think', 'better', 'leave', 'out', 'visual', 'effects', 'rather', 'allow', 'completely', 'ruin', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'know', 'more', 'how', 'scenes', 'felt', 'rather', 'just', 'looked', 'end', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'rest', 'hard', 'feel', 'anxiety', 'room', 'well', 'lit', 'dream', 'sequence', 'just', 'foggy', 'dark', 'stage', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'worked', 'pretty', 'well', 'fact', 'just', 'feel', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'music', 'also', 'killed', 'mood', 'film.It', 'hard', 'commit', 'recommending', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'hand', 'think', 'was', 'well', 'executed', 'what', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'technical', 'side', 'media', 'creation', 'would', 'appreciate', 'film', 'what', 'want', 'good', 'scare', 'great', 'characters', 'hold', 'most', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'tell', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'do', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'least', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'due', ""n't"", 'just', 'good', 'independent', 'horror', 'movie', 'far', 'better', 'many', 'big', 'budget', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'even', 'highly', 'rated', 'independents', 'just', 'small', 'crew', 'limited', 'resources', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'hardest', 'thing', 'do', 'movie', 'making']",House of Black Wings

Young,"[3, 5]","WARNING:  If you can't appreciate microbudgeted independent cinema, turn back now, and do not purchase this item.That caveat aside, House of Black Wings is a fine, creepy addition to the Lovecraftian Horror genre.  While the movie suffers some from being shot on video, they truly make the most with what they have.  The script is well-written (mostly), and while there are few scares, the combination of script, performance, lighting, and inventive camera work from writer/director David Schmidt creates a palpable sense of dread that permeates throughout.In a way I was reminded of Kurt Vonnegut's definition of Gothic--'a young girl moves into a spooky house and gets the pants scared off her.'  While there's much more to the movie than that, it's certainly the template that House of Black Wings comes from.Our two female leads turn in fairly strong performances, with particular kudos going to Leah Mylette as an emotionally and physically damaged musician moving into a spooky apartment block run by an old friend, played by Katherine Herrera.  The important thing here is to establish the caring relationship between the two, and the actresses make it work very well.There are numerous fine touches that, while not commented on in the film, add to the creepiness.  In addition, the makeup effects, while completely practical, create some moments that can make your skin crawl, if only a bit.And when it comes to the DVD special features, well...the ""making of"" featurette, while only 15 minutes long, is actually more of a production diary, and gives the viewer a fascinating look into the world of microbudget filming.To sum up:  House of Black Wings achieves more with nothing than most horror films do with studio backing.
