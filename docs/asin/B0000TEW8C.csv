This one opens in Tibet with Angel mourning over Buffy's death, and fighting demon monks. With Buffy on UPN & Angel on The WB there are no more crossovers and it shows- two or three lines about Buffy in the first couple of episodes and a brief hint about Angels dead girlfriends (""not that one- the other one"")then not another word about her until sometime late in fourth season.I did like the Darla stories, Julie Benz makes that role look easy but thought that the Holtz character/storyline, who appears in about half the episodes (and whose family was killed by Angel & Darla in the 18th century), could have been handled better,looking back now it seems that the whole storyline was just filler in preparation for next season. I liked the stand alone episodes much better and some bits like Fred's gradual readjustment to normal life and her eventual romance with Gunn, even the episode with her parents coming for a visit, do quite well.Worth owning if you've got the rest and better than fourth season.",3,"Season One was the best, this one is 2 1/2 stars",1092355200,"08 13, 2004",2004,1129,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'four', 'seasons', 'Angel', 'now', 'have', 'say', 'season', 'first', 'three', 'weaker', 'last', 'one', 'Tibet', 'Angel', 'mourning', 'Buffy', 'death', 'fighting', 'demon', 'monks', 'Buffy', 'UPN', 'Angel', 'WB', 'are', 'more', 'crossovers', 'shows-', 'two', 'three', 'lines', 'Buffy', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'brief', 'hint', 'Angels', 'dead', 'girlfriends', 'not', 'one-', 'other', 'one', 'then', 'not', 'word', 'sometime', 'late', 'fourth', 'season.I', 'did', 'Darla', 'stories', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'role', 'look', 'easy', 'thought', 'Holtz', 'character/storyline', 'who', 'episodes', 'family', 'was', 'killed', 'Angel', 'Darla', '18th', 'century', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'better', 'looking', 'back', 'now', 'whole', 'storyline', 'was', 'just', 'filler', 'preparation', 'next', 'season', 'liked', 'stand', 'alone', 'much', 'better', 'bits', 'Fred', 'gradual', 'readjustment', 'normal', 'life', 'eventual', 'romance', 'Gunn', 'even', 'episode', 'parents', 'coming', 'visit', 'do', 'quite', 'well.Worth', 'owning', ""'ve"", 'got', 'rest', 'better', 'fourth', 'season']",N/A

I'm not prone to handing out spoilers so I won't ruin any of the season for people who haven't seen it yet, but season three is one of the best seasons of Angel because of these highs and lows that you experience with the characters.  One minute you are laughing harder than you've ever laughed with them, the next minute you are mad at them, and then the next minute you find yourself crying for or with them.Season three is also one of the greater seasons because of the addition of Fred into the cast.  She is a terrific character that has benefited the show very much.  It is amazing to see how the characters all have developed through-out this show.  It is almost hilarious to watch season one of Buffy and compare the Angel and Cordelia from then to the Angel and Cordelia in season three of Angel.  Or to go to season three of Buffy where we are first introduced to Wesley.  He has changed more than any other character.Well, hats off to Joss Whedon, David Greenwalt, Tim Minear, and company as they again have pulled off a terrific season of a great television show.

782873,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0000TEW8C,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[6, 8]","After seeing the marvel that was Angel-Season 2, I never thought that it could be topped.  We saw the fall and rise of Angel (David Boreanaz), without turning into Angelus, at the hands of Wolfram and Hart, Darla (Julie Benz), and Drusilla (Juliette Landau).  We saw Cordelia (Charisma Carpentar), Wes (Alexis Denisof), and Gunn (J. August Richards) form deep bonds.  And we saw the group go to Pylea, the home-world of Lorne the Host (Andy Hallet), where they rescued Fred (Amy Acker) and turned the feudal land into a democracy.  I am telling you this because I want you to know the competition Season 3 had when I tell you that it successfully outdid the previous season.Things start off three months later with Angel in a Tibetan monestary, where he has gone to sort out his thoughts about his dearly departed lover, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), the Slayer.  While the gang was in Pylea, Buffy died defending the world... again.  Anyway, upon his return, he learns that everything went smoothly, except that Fred is afraid to leave her room without the vampire hero.  She was sucked into Pylea through a portal five years ago, and she doesn't want to repeat the experience.  Anyway, after Angel's first case back, he realizes something that nearly kills him; Buffy's death, while tragic, has not prevented him from living on, which he thought would be impossible.  Quite the contrary, really.  I believe that this set in motion a series of events that may not have transpired had Buffy not moved to a different network, but more on that later.Soon, Darla is revealed to be pregnant, which should be impossible.  Vampires are sterile, and even if they weren't, they are dead, so there would be no way for her to nourish hers and Angel's child.  Yet it has come to pass.  Wes determines that the birth of Connor, Angel's son, is part of the Tro-Clan, a prophesised series of mystical events that will change the world greatly.  The other part of the Tro-Clan is the re-emerging of Daniel Holtz (Keith Szarabajka), a vampire hunter whom Angelus and Darla tortured in the 18th century.  He was brought forth by the time-travelling demon Sahjahn (Jack Conley) in order to help get revenge upon the vampire pair.  However, when Holtz sees Darla die and Connor born, he changes his strategy; he organizes a group of people who have lost loved ones to vamps in order to steal Connor away from Angel.  One of these people is a woman named Justine Cooper (Laurel Holloman), who becomes Holtz's lover and confidante.Wolfram and Hart also take an interest in baby Connor, as does Wesley, who believes Angel may kill his new son.  Things continue to go from bad to worse up until the heartbreaking season finale.This has been the best season of Angel yet, but it is not without some &quot;problems&quot;.  First of all, even though I grew to like the Groosalug (Mark Lutz), his relationship with Cordelia was a repeat of Buffy and Riley (Marc Blucas).  He loved her, she didn't love him back the way he wanted.  He leaves.  Sound familiar?  This takes me back to what I was saying earlier about Angel and Cordelia; had Buffy's show remained on the WB, crossovers would have been allowed (this was a problem too; no Buffy/Angel crossovers), the Angel/Cordelia romance would never (I think) have happened.  Buffy is Angel's only true love.  Angel pulled himself out of the gutter to help her, then he rose from Hell to be with her again.  Would he have done anything like that for Cordelia three years ago?  Two years ago?  Not even last year would he have done this.  But this year, all of the sudden, they realize this deep love for each other.  Oh well.  This was a great season, none the less.Joss Whedon is one of television's greatest assets, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly are undeniable proof.  This is one of the best TV boxed sets that I own.  Some good episodes are: Heartthrob, Carpe Noctem, Fredless, Billy, Offspring, Lullabye, Dad, Birthday, Provider, Loyalty, Sleep Tight, Forgiving, The Price, A New World, Benediction, and Tomorrow.

782874,A1FE06N5A77K8W,B0000TEW8C,Annie Feng,"[1, 4]","this season does not altogether blend well as the other seasons. But rather serves as a ""bridge"" from the first two seasons to the last two seasons. And it was a good ""bridge"", just the show is not as strong as the other seasons.This season is like ""sticking"" shows to explain the future shows to come. It moved from the transformation of Fred, the coming to Angel's son, Angel's final relationship with Darla, and the betrayal of Wesley( the climax of the season).alot of people thinks the coming of Angel's son is the climax of the third season, which is not really true. the fact that we don't know anything about Angel's son, or what does it mean, makes it not the climax of this season. instead, the betrayal of Wesley is the strength of this season. It showed the uniqueness of Wesley, that he is loyal to Angel in both ways- that he cares for Angel and would do anything to save him. but also is willing to do whatever it takes to bring Angel down if Angel goes into the dark side. Wesley believes connor is what will bring Angel to the dark side again- that Angel will devour his own son by the temptation of connor's blood. So Wesley was afraid and confused and acted on his own by taking connor away. But Wesley was also manipulated. This marked Wesley's downfall by depending too much on prophecies to make their next move. I thought this was brilliantly done- the point that Angel shouldn't be always using prophecies as fighting strategies, because it may not come true or there may be another loophole.The most touching part of this season is the death of Darla. That the coming of Angel's son makes his connection with Darla complete. That after all the evil they've done they are finally be able to do something good, and Darla's redemption was complete when she killed herself in order to save Angel's son. And Angel is finally able to grieve for Darla he couldn't in season two ( when Angel swore to stay with Darla until she dies). This marked the perfect ending for Darla and her relationship with Angel.This season also introduced the twisted villian- Holtz, the one who has the pure hatred for Angel and therefore became a villian himself by letting the darkness of the hatred take over him. And the coming of the ""really bad thing"" is really when Sajhan transported Holtz into this world that started the chain of connor, cordelia and finally jasmine, the source of the apocalyse.The weak part of this season: Angel's character development. I really didn't like the wimpy, hyper, fatherhood obsessing Angel instead of the brooding, cool, dark one. Even though Angel's behavior is excusible because he was drinking spiked blood which turned him alittle crazy. But funny Angel really isn't funny anymore when he does it every single episode. I know in season one whenever Angel does something out of ordinary or funny it's really hilarious and people like to see more of that. But no, it's more stupid than funny this time. I was really glad when Wesley betrayed him and pulled him out of the wimpy guy back to broody, what Angel should be.overall, you definitely need it in order to get the brilliant season four and five.",4,"a great season, but weakest of Angel",1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,3144,"['season', 'not', 'altogether', 'blend', 'well', 'other', 'seasons', 'rather', 'bridge', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'was', 'good', 'bridge', 'just', 'show', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'other', 'seasons.This', 'season', 'sticking', 'shows', 'explain', 'future', 'come', 'moved', 'transformation', 'Fred', 'coming', 'Angel', 'son', 'Angel', 'final', 'relationship', 'Darla', 'betrayal', 'Wesley', 'climax', 'season', '.alot', 'people', 'thinks', 'coming', 'Angel', 'son', 'climax', 'third', 'season', 'not', 'really', 'true', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Angel', 'son', 'what', 'mean', 'not', 'climax', 'season', 'instead', 'betrayal', 'Wesley', 'strength', 'season', 'showed', 'uniqueness', 'Wesley', 'loyal', 'Angel', 'ways-', 'Angel', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'save', 'also', 'willing', 'do', 'whatever', 'bring', 'Angel', 'down', 'Angel', 'dark', 'side', 'Wesley', 'connor', 'what', 'will', 'bring', 'Angel', 'dark', 'side', 'again-', 'Angel', 'will', 'devour', 'own', 'son', 'temptation', 'connor', 'blood', 'So', 'Wesley', 'was', 'afraid', 'confused', 'acted', 'own', 'taking', 'connor', 'away', 'Wesley', 'was', 'also', 'manipulated', 'marked', 'Wesley', 'downfall', 'depending', 'too', 'much', 'prophecies', 'make', 'next', 'move', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'done-', 'point', 'Angel', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'always', 'using', 'prophecies', 'fighting', 'strategies', 'may', 'not', 'come', 'true', 'may', 'be', 'loophole.The', 'most', 'touching', 'part', 'season', 'death', 'Darla', 'coming', 'Angel', 'son', 'connection', 'Darla', 'complete', 'evil', ""'ve"", 'done', 'are', 'finally', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'something', 'good', 'Darla', 'redemption', 'was', 'complete', 'when', 'killed', 'order', 'save', 'Angel', 'son', 'Angel', 'finally', 'able', 'grieve', 'Darla', 'could', ""n't"", 'season', 'two', 'when', 'Angel', 'swore', 'stay', 'Darla', 'marked', 'perfect', 'ending', 'Darla', 'relationship', 'Angel.This', 'season', 'also', 'introduced', 'twisted', 'villian-', 'Holtz', 'one', 'who', 'pure', 'hatred', 'Angel', 'therefore', 'became', 'villian', 'letting', 'darkness', 'hatred', 'take', 'coming', 'really', 'bad', 'thing', 'really', 'when', 'Sajhan', 'transported', 'Holtz', 'world', 'started', 'chain', 'connor', 'cordelia', 'finally', 'jasmine', 'source', 'apocalyse.The', 'weak', 'part', 'season', 'Angel', 'character', 'development', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'wimpy', 'hyper', 'fatherhood', 'obsessing', 'Angel', 'instead', 'brooding', 'cool', 'dark', 'one', 'Even', 'Angel', 'behavior', 'excusible', 'was', 'drinking', 'spiked', 'blood', 'turned', 'alittle', 'crazy', 'funny', 'Angel', 'really', ""n't"", 'funny', 'anymore', 'when', 'single', 'episode', 'know', 'season', 'one', 'Angel', 'something', 'ordinary', 'funny', 'really', 'hilarious', 'people', 'see', 'more', 'more', 'stupid', 'funny', 'time', 'was', 'really', 'glad', 'when', 'Wesley', 'betrayed', 'pulled', 'wimpy', 'guy', 'back', 'broody', 'what', 'Angel', 'should', 'be.overall', 'definitely', 'need', 'order', 'get', 'brilliant', 'season', 'four', 'five']",N/A
782875,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0000TEW8C,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[11, 14]","Many people doubted it. Many thought that there would never come a day when ""Buffy""'s sister series, ""Angel"", would surpass the cult phenomenon it was spun off from. But it did. And this was the season that did it. This was the first season of the show that was no longer connected to ""Buffy"" because that show had made the move to UPN. ""Angel"" was left on it's own and many questioned it's fate. Surprising to all, it had found it's feet and was stronger than ever. The death of Buffy at the end of season five is mentioned in the premiere, ""Heartthrob"", which was one of the better seaosn premieres of the show. We are then back in Gunn territory with the ""That Old Gang Of Mine"" episode. Gunn-centric episodes have usually been the worst ones, but this one is an exception. Very good. Cordelia is given mind numbing visions in ""That Vision Thing"", courtesy of evil law firm Wolfram & Hart. To end the pain, Angel must do them a favor. Fred gets her turn to shine in an un-exceptional episode called,""Fredless"". After these minor, but very entertaining eps, the show kicks into gear and delves into the seaosn long arc. Angel's former love, Darla, is back. And she is carrying Angel's child. The one night they spent together last season has brought them to this new situation. ""Offspring"", deals with Darla's return to the hotel to deliver Angel the news. But the real bad news is that vampire hunter Holtz, who was after Angelus and Darla in the 18th century for killing his family, has been brought to present day by a demon named Sahjhan, to finish off Angel. ""Quickening"" deals with all walks of life, from Wolfram & Hart, to demon monks, after the unborn child. The big climax is in the next two episodes. ""Lullaby"", a gorgeous, perfect episode, gives way to an incredible moment where Darla sacrifices herself to give birth to the baby. This was a real turning point for Darla. In the rain. In an alley. A classic moment. ""Dad"" is a more action packed episode where the hotel is under siege by villains as Angel tries to protect his new son. These are two important episodes. We then get two episodes of filler, ""Birthday"" and ""Provider"", until the best season yet continues with the Joss Whedon penned and directed, ""Waiting In The Wings"". A brilliant episode that finds our gang going to the ballet, where a ghostly presence brings out romantic scenarios within the gang. The biggest, and best, twist, was the new road that Wesley(Alexis Denisoff)takes. In ""Loyalty"", he discovers a prophecy that says that Angel will kill his son. Wesley's actions to protect baby Connor come crashing down on him, and everyone else, in the #1 episode of the season, ""Sleep Tight"". This was the episode that changed everything. This is the episode that brings out the best in the series. Shocking, surprising, thrilling, and unrelenting. This episode is ""Angel"" at it's perfect best. Holtz also kidnaps Connor and disappears with him into a portal into another dimension. The follow up episode, ""Forgiving"", is almost as good. Angel kidnaps the head of Wolfram & Hart to torture him to reveal what he knows, and the end delivers another jaw dropping scene that came out of nowhere and gives more proof of how the show has gotten to be so good with it's twists and shocking surprises. Something that ""Buffy"" used to do, but started to lack in. A couple more filler episodes, and then we have ""A New World"". Connor has returned from the other dimension, and he has grown into a 16 year old kid. It'll explain how. Don't worry. He is wild, a fighter, and doesn't take interest in sticking with Angel. More comes out in ""Benediction"", as Holtz figures back into the equation and reveals his plans for Angel. And Wes, declining even more, becomes involved with evil lawyer, Lilah. It all comes to a head in the finale, ""Tommorrow"". This episodes really gives you a couple of cliffhangers that seaosn finales of this show don't normally do. I won't spill it here. Season three of this show was, and still reamins, the best season of the show. It was exciting, thrilling, and had many mouth dropping gasps that ultimatley made it the better show between itself and it's flagship series. The writing was strong, creative, mind blowing, sad, and funny. The cast equaled the quality of the excellent writing this season with performances that really drove the greatness of it home. David Boreanaz continues to grow as a performer, and gets better with each passing season. Alexis Denisof tho, was the real treasure of the season. His character went thru so much later in the season, and his transformation was amazing to watch. Fantastic.

782879,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0000TEW8C,calvinnme,"[0, 2]","Angel the series can basically be broken into three parts, season 1- which really lacked a cohesive story arc as the main characters are introduced, the final season which also stands alone, and the three season story arc that runs from season 2 through season 4.This particular season deals with the product of Angel's one night stand with Darla in season 2 - a mystical pregnancy that should be impossible since the parents are vampires. Although we find out about this pregnancy during the last moments of the first episode of the season, nothing is done with this information in the storyline until episode seven. To me, although they were pretty good episodes, the first six episodes seemed like filler. When Darla does arrive on Angel's doorstep, it is quickly determined that the unborn child has a soul, but the Fang Gang has other problems besides dealing with Darla. Hot on their trail is both Holtz, an enemy from Angel's unsouled past who has been mystically resurrected, and Wolfram & Hart, which wants to dissect Darla and her unborn child. As Angel and Darla's child approaches birth, Darla shares her child's soul and realizes the only way that the baby can live is for her to stake herself, which she does.The next few episodes deal with Angel adjusting to fatherhood, with Wolfram & Hart and also Holtz still lurking in the background. Wesley reads an ancient prophecy which says ""The father shall kill the son"" and after further study determines he must kidnap Angel's infant son, Conner, in order to save him. This ultimately leads to tragedy, as Holtz and his accomplice Justine cut Wesley's throat and leave him for dead, intending to steal Angel's child as revenge for Angel having killed Holtz' child centuries before. However, Holtz is cornered by other forces that want the child, and decides to leap into a portal to a hell dimension with the baby as his only means of escape. The Fang Gang is able to piece together what Wesley did and why he did it, but a devastated Angel is understandably unable to forgive Wesley for the unintended consequences of his actions. A hardened and shunned Wesley, feeling he is both betrayer and betrayed, becomes the true ""rogue demon hunter"" that he had comically claimed to be when Angel found him two years before.Towards the end of the season, Conner suddenly emerges from the hell dimension, 18 years old, a battle-hardened hunter and hater of demons and of Angel in particular. Considering Holtz' story of Angel's exploits as an unsouled vampire were probably his bedtime stories as a child, this is to be expected. Holtz also emerges from the hell dimension, now an old man, and reunites with Justine. Together they hatch a plan in which she kills Holtz and frames Angel so that Conner will be understandably vengeful. The plan works, and the season ends with Conner and Justine capturing Angel and throwing him into a cage at the bottom of the sea, to endure a living hell forever. There are other subplots hatching on top of this story- Gunn and Wesley both falling for Fred, the girl they rescued from Pylea, evil Lilah trying to entice fallen Wesley to work for Wolfram & Hart, and probably most importantly, Angel is finally taking emotional steps away from Buffy's memory and slowly moving romantically towards someone else. This is another great season of Angel, full of tragedy and plot twists, delivered through terrific writing and acting.

782881,A2AXP78ZZ42FVC,B0000TEW8C,"Charles Scott Bennett ""Mr. Bennett""","[2, 9]","I love this series! But Connor and Holtz were just two huge mistakes added to an otherwise perfectly coordinated cast. There were so many roads to choose and they chose poorly. Ugh. Charisma gets prettier and more interesting as Cordelia, and David is plump but still loveable as the unpredictable hero. The supporting cast does their best. But the first two seasons are definitely better! On a personal note, (and I have debated this issue with fellow 'fanboys' of the show), I find it unbelievable that Gunn would fall for Fred. I mean, she doesn't have much guts. Besides, if he's from &quot;the hood&quot;, where the women are &quot;tough&quot; and &quot;thick&quot; (as they are portrayed in the house party sequence in season 2), then wouldn't Gunn find Fred kind of weak and hungry looking? Anyway, they make more than the unlikely pair. The writing here seems like a forced and fake reason to make Wesley 'lose it', thereby moving the story forward. Also, will someone please tell Andy Halett to please stick to acting, but keep the singing in the real karaoke bars of L.A. You're not that good, Andy. Please make it stop. However, getting this dvd was worth the money, if only to see Darla's character take a huge arch.

782882,AUPYKCIQEITAS,B0000TEW8C,Cinephile,"[6, 7]","Season Three of ANGEL ran contemporaneously with Season Six of its then-estranged sister show, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (network politics and Hollywood egos had resulted in a channel shift for the latter, and a ""ban"" on the cross-over episodes that had fueled both shows' previous two seasons). A quick glance at the tone of both shows suggests it must have been a bummer of a year at  their parent company, Mutant Enemy: both are extraordinarily bleak, plunging their characters into dark places and difficult emotional situations that reshape nearly  everything viewers had come to expect from each program. I should quickly add that both shows are also superb-- BUFFY, in particular, is so powerful, and closes its sixth season with such emotional and thematic finality, that it's hard to view its seventh and final year as anything but a pandering anti-climax (but that's a review for a different time). ANGEL, on the other hand, was just warming up.Season Three is a crucial one for ANGEL, acting as a bridge between the low-key, stand-alone episodes of Seasons One and Two and the intense darkness (and epic narrative) of Season Four.  Season Two laid the groundwork for such a shift, by bringing back Angel's old paramour Darla and moving evil law firm Wolfram & Hart to center stage (they'd played a peripheral role in Seaon One), and, especially in its second half, the second season flirts with brilliance.  But it is in Season Three when this new narrative style takes full effect, resulting in what is arguably ANGEL's best year.  Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt, ANGEL's co-creators, executive producers and chief creative figures, keep a perfect balance between the intimately personal and the excessively epic, reconfiguring several character relationships, introducing crucial new heroes and villains, and throwing the reader into a storyline of love, family, violence and betrayal worthy of Tony Soprano.Of course, Tony Soprano never had to encounter a giant demon named Skip; a ballerina under the spell of an eternal dance (in musical geek whedon's tribute to THE RED SHOES, ""Waiting in the Wings""); a vampire hunter named holtz; sex-crazed, karaoke-blessing sirens; or a talking plastic hamburger that holds the secrets of a crucial prophecy.  All of these elements remind the viewer that they are in the WhedonVerse, where the sublime and the ridiculous mingle promiscuously, and to great effect.  If it's hard for you to reconcile that such fantastic elements can co-exist alongside some of the funniest comedy (the laugh-out-loud sitcom parody at the center of ""birthday"") and the most moving drama (really the whole year, but especially ""forgiving""), well then, perhaps you shouldn't be watching a show about a vampire with a soul (if reductive histrionics and easy answers are what you're after, there's always SIX FEET UNDER).For everyone else, sit back and enjoy some of the best recent television on DVD. All of the writers and directors are at the top of their games here (special mention should also be made of composer Robert Kral's mournful scores, and the superb camerawork), and so is the cast.  In a year when all of the leads are having fun adding new shades to their characters.......If you want great action, well-rounded characters, and one of the more striking season-ending cliffhangers on TV, you really can't go wrong with this purchase.",4,suffocatingly good,1073520000,"01 8, 2004",2004,3380,"['Season', 'Three', 'ANGEL', 'ran', 'contemporaneously', 'Season', 'Six', 'then-estranged', 'sister', 'show', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'network', 'politics', 'Hollywood', 'egos', 'had', 'resulted', 'channel', 'shift', 'latter', 'ban', 'cross-over', 'had', 'fueled', 'shows', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'quick', 'glance', 'tone', 'shows', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'bummer', 'year', 'parent', 'company', 'Mutant', 'Enemy', 'are', 'extraordinarily', 'bleak', 'plunging', 'characters', 'dark', 'places', 'difficult', 'emotional', 'situations', 'reshape', 'nearly', 'everything', 'viewers', 'had', 'come', 'expect', 'program', 'should', 'quickly', 'add', 'shows', 'are', 'also', 'superb', 'BUFFY', 'particular', 'so', 'powerful', 'sixth', 'season', 'such', 'emotional', 'thematic', 'finality', 'hard', 'view', 'seventh', 'final', 'year', 'anything', 'pandering', 'anti-climax', 'review', 'different', 'time', 'ANGEL', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'just', 'warming', 'up.Season', 'Three', 'crucial', 'one', 'ANGEL', 'acting', 'bridge', 'low-key', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'intense', 'darkness', 'epic', 'narrative', 'Season', 'Four', 'Season', 'Two', 'laid', 'groundwork', 'shift', 'bringing', 'back', 'Angel', 'old', 'paramour', 'Darla', 'moving', 'evil', 'law', 'firm', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'center', 'stage', ""'d"", 'played', 'peripheral', 'role', 'Seaon', 'One', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'second', 'season', 'flirts', 'brilliance', 'Season', 'Three', 'when', 'new', 'narrative', 'style', 'full', 'effect', 'resulting', 'what', 'arguably', 'ANGEL', 'best', 'year', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'David', 'Greenwalt', 'ANGEL', 'co-creators', 'executive', 'producers', 'chief', 'creative', 'figures', 'keep', 'perfect', 'balance', 'intimately', 'personal', 'excessively', 'epic', 'reconfiguring', 'several', 'character', 'relationships', 'introducing', 'crucial', 'new', 'heroes', 'villains', 'throwing', 'reader', 'storyline', 'love', 'family', 'violence', 'betrayal', 'worthy', 'Tony', 'Soprano.Of', 'course', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'never', 'had', 'encounter', 'giant', 'demon', 'named', 'Skip', 'ballerina', 'spell', 'eternal', 'dance', 'musical', 'geek', 'whedon', 'tribute', 'THE', 'RED', 'SHOES', 'Waiting', 'Wings', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'named', 'holtz', 'sex-crazed', 'karaoke-blessing', 'sirens', 'talking', 'plastic', 'hamburger', 'secrets', 'crucial', 'prophecy', 'elements', 'remind', 'viewer', 'are', 'WhedonVerse', 'where', 'sublime', 'ridiculous', 'mingle', 'promiscuously', 'great', 'effect', 'hard', 'reconcile', 'such', 'fantastic', 'elements', 'can', 'co-exist', 'funniest', 'comedy', 'laugh-out-loud', 'sitcom', 'parody', 'center', 'birthday', 'most', 'moving', 'drama', 'really', 'whole', 'year', 'especially', 'forgiving', 'well', 'then', 'perhaps', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'show', 'vampire', 'soul', 'reductive', 'histrionics', 'easy', 'answers', 'are', 'what', ""'re"", 'always', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', '.For', 'everyone', 'else', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'best', 'recent', 'television', 'DVD', 'writers', 'directors', 'are', 'top', 'games', 'here', 'special', 'mention', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'composer', 'Robert', 'Kral', 'mournful', 'scores', 'superb', 'camerawork', 'so', 'cast', 'year', 'when', 'leads', 'are', 'having', 'fun', 'adding', 'new', 'shades', 'characters', '.If', 'want', 'great', 'action', 'well-rounded', 'characters', 'one', 'more', 'striking', 'season-ending', 'cliffhangers', 'TV', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'purchase']",N/A

However, it wasn't until the end of season two where the show truly came into its own and completely overshadowed BUFFY as being an even better spin-off. For me season three was the absolute best as it took a slightly darker turn, becoming more serious and dramatic. The episodes usually left one hanging, thirsting for more. And certain roles were given more depth to their character -- Wesley Price being the more obvious one. He brilliantly goes from the meak, clumsy brain of the team to becoming a tough, brooding outcast once his friends turn their backs on him after a betrayal brewed by deceitful lies.Some lose their ways, others find their destiny's (or so they think), and nothing's ever quite as it seems.

The shows that are forced down our throats these days basically seem to follow formulas and are very routine.So the creative team behind Angel, as they did with season two, expanded the show for its third year and it became a creatively superior show, sometimes surpassing Buffy.And while the show could, at times, prevent new viewers from joining in, it still offered enough backstory in the ""Previously on Angel"" clips to get anyone caught up. So, I blame the laziness of viewers for the more episodic nature of Angel's current fifth season.Anyway, season three really opened the show and every actor was able to grow more comfortable with their characters, with Carisma Carpenter becoming a fully rounded Cordelia, despite the ever changing hairstyle and personal issues that forced her out of 3 very important episodes during the later half of the season. And despite a previous post, her issues where never with Whedon, but with Fox. She wanted to reduce her schedule on the show so she could have a baby, and I think Fox punished her by forcing her to get her personal life together.The only drawback to the season was Connor. The storyline was too daytime television for my taste, and I think it's nebulae nature of the final arc -Carpenter's personal issues -forced the writers into a corner they did not know how to get out of.Still, the series is 1000 times better than most drama's produced these days.

The most dissapointing part of this whole season was the character development of Saint Cordelia.  The woman with some sense of comic relief and strength now becomes MY MOM.  This is most evident in the last conversation of the first episode, ""Heartthrob"" when she becomes the trusted counselor who helps Angel pour his heart out about Buffy.  And it only gets worse from there.In terms of a ""big bad"", let's just put Holtz at the bottom of the list.  I snooze every time he's on the screen.  A 45 year old man kills 10 heavily-armed soldiers of Wolfram and Hart with a single axe in episode ""Lullaby""?Even Angel's development is regressive, not progressive.  He becomes paranoid, uncertain, and a babbling fool with his new baby.  At one point his character descends to such stupidity that a woman (who is infected and becoming a demon when she sings - episode ""Loyalty"") is talking about her horrific situation as Angel ignores her and theorizes about why the Flying Nun is called the Flying Nun.  where were the high-priced writers at that moment?  where were the editors?  Where was Joss?I would say that the only saving grace about the season would be Wesley's development into a strong power figure.  That is, until he contradicts everything about being a noble being and clubs Lorne over the head, and gives Angel's kid to his sworn enemy.Darla's character played excellently by Julie Benz is the strongest part of this season.  If you're going to watch it, I suggest you enjoy her performance while it lasts.  Her last moments during this season are spectacular and heart-wrenching.To sum up, this season becomes more about personal relationships, and less about Angel's mission, his purpose.  The show is more concerned whether Angel is getting a crush on Cordy and less about helping those in need.  What about Buffy?  His true love!!!!!  Did this love interest between he and Cordy seem as awful and unreal as it did to me?I await Season 4 on DVD.

782895,A28ILXH590CMRJ,B0000TEW8C,Hazen B Markoe,"[6, 8]","When the third season of the BUFFY spin-off ANGEL rolled around, the show found itself truly on its own.  For one thing, its parent series had moved to another network over a dispute over production renewal costs.  As a result, crossovers between the two shows were not likely to happen.  Fortunately, ANGEL continued to grow creatively with one of its best seasons to date. In fact, many critics and fans rated this series better than BUFFY, which was mired in a rather dark sixth season on UPN.  After mourning the seeming death of long-time love Buffy, Angel prepares to resume his mission of ""helping the helpless.""  Things get complicated when his old love, the vampire Darla, returns to LA in a VERY pregnant state.  Add to that the return of an old foe from his Angelus days and Angel finds himself in the fight of his undead life.  Angel will need all the support of his friends, but even that is not assured when one is forced to betray him.Once again, the cast is at their top-notch best in this darkly enthralling series.  David Boreanez continues to grow as the heroic Angel.  Alexis Denisof continues the marvelous development of former Watcher Wesley from a comic fop into a hard-edged fighter who's not afraid to make the hard choices.  Charisma Carpenter's Cordelia is still fun, but the character starts to lose her edge as she matures.  Julie Benz is delightfully evil as the returning Darla and she makes the most of her featured story-line.  Amy Acker joins the cast in fine form as the addled genius Fred.  As always, J August Richards and Andy Hallett provide solid support as Gunn and Lorne (aka the Host) respectively.As always, this DVD set has the usual commentaries and featurettes.  The one new thing is an outtake reel that shows Boreanez as quite the fun-loving guy in contrast to his dour screen persona.As in the previous two seasons, ANGEL is, again, a solid series that provides chills, laughs and enough dramatic angst to satisfy the most discriminating of TV critics.

782896,A38KB16DRKI8QW,B0000TEW8C,High Duke,"[3, 7]","It'll probably be sacrilege to many people when I say this, but I have always thought that ANGEL was a way better show than BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  I know that a lot of people couldn't get into this show, but for me, Angel was always the most compelling character on BUFFY anyway, so it was easy to move along with him.  Does no one seem to notice how BUFFY got progressively worse without Angel on the show?  Like Buffy, Angel brought in a lot of elements from many different genres: vampire myths, comic book superheroes, film noir, mystery stories, historical folklore, horror, fantasy and even a touch of soap opera melodrama.  There were several things that made the show really great.  One was the characters.  Angel, the dark brooding vampire with a soul, was basically sent out on a mission by the Powers That Be to keep Los Angeles from becoming a hellhole and to regain his humanity.  He was joined from Sunnydale by Cordelia, Buffy's flighty high school nemesis, and Doyle, the Irish half-demon who helped Angel settle into his role in L.A. before meeting his untimely demise.  He was replaced by another Buffy holdover, Wesley, who became a much more interesting character on this program.  There was Gunn, the street kid who joined Angel's detective agency crew and Fred, who joined the show during this season as a brainy, sweet girl they saved from another dimension. And let's not forget the Host, Lorne, a karaoke singing empath demon who could read people's fortunes whenever they sang.  The villians were spectacular as well, especially Wolfram & Hart's rogues gallery of evil lawyers.  The two best were Lilah, the sexy and sinister temptress and Lindsay, her rival for the heartless hearts of the Board of Directors.  Darla, Angel's vampire lover who was ressurected to taunt him, was a great addition as well.  It was really hard to not get involved with all the characters lives in the show and that was thanks to the programs great writers, most certainly a carry over from BUFFY.  Another great element was the way the stories began to interlock after season two and made you follow the show more closely and intensely than BUFFY.  ANGEL was a much more adult show than BUFFY and dealt with more adult themes; namely the mistakes that you make in adulthood have more far-reaching consequences than the ones made in high school.  It was like a study into humankind's duality with Angel representing both the light and the dark, and struggling with it all the way through.  Angel has only gotten better with every season and this one, Season Three, was especially outstanding.  The show was firing on all cylinders by this point.  All the characters were well established and the story arch was engrossing, from start to finish.  After Angel went nutso in season two, he somehow managed to get Darla pregnant, a supposed impossibility for vampires.  They was being stalked by a vampire hunter, who's family he'd slaughtered a century before, named Holtz.  Darla sacrifices herself to give Angel a son, but that's short lived when Holtz kidnaps the baby into another dimension.  Wesley all of a sudden became this dark character ostracized from the rest of the team after he misread a prophecy and tried to hide Angel's son from him.  One of the best episodes ever was the one where Angel nearly killed Wesley in the hospital after his failed attempt to hide the baby lead to its kidnapping.  This is quite possibly one of the best shows ever aired on television, but, because it belongs in the genre fiction category, it doesn't get its due and is ignored.  That's too bad.  The dark humour on the show is part of the perfect balance it maintains, so as to not let itself get too heavy-handed and the show has this palpable feeling of loneliness and melancholy, which gives it a charm a sit explores human frailty and courage.  This show is right up there with the 'Twilight Zone' in terms of depth, inventiveness and storytelling.  The way the season ended was fantastic and lead to high hopes for Season Four, which I found great in many ways, but the show kind of seemed to lose its way a bit, especially with their inability to figure out what to do with Cordelia and Connor, Angel's grown up son.  I unfortunately have missed all of Season Five (I moved to Croatia before it aired) but I heard the show returned to form that season and left on an open-ended note.

Instead it just got an hour and that hour leaves more questions than it gave answers and just made you want more. Plus ened with Angel and all his buddies acting like they were gonna die as they were getting ready to fight a huge army of demons. Then the show just ended saying bye and Thanks ?? It bugged me because as I was getting ready for this huge battle they just ended it like that. So you have no idea who lives and who dies, but you get a thanks for watching for 5 years at least. Would've been nice if Sarah Michell Gellar made an appearence as Buffy as well. Guess she's too good for that though. I mean she is making Oscar worthy Scooby Doo movies now after all lol.I think this show easily could've went on for another 2 years. I'm going to really miss it and I hate how it ended. Anyway season 3 was the best one like Season 3 of Buffy was the best one. When Angel had a quick fling with Darla in season 2 he got her pregnant. She has their son Connor and then dies. Connor is eventually taken by Wesley who thinks Angel will harm the baby. Connor is then stolen from Wesley and taken into a portal. He comes back from the portal as a teenager. He was trained to hate vampires and of course he hates his father. Angel trys his best to gain his love but to no revail. Angel gets framed for the murder of who Connor accepts as his real father ""the guy who took him from Wesley"". So that doesn't go well of course and Connor betrays Angel as the season ends.

782902,AIQCCJLXIXFVR,B0000TEW8C,just me,"[0, 0]","I LOVE this season. I can't decide whether I like season 2 or 3 more. I love the growth of Cordy's character through the seasons. Some have a hard time seeing how Cordy can change, but people don't usually stay the same people they were in High School and as you could see from the Cordy/Xander relationship (even though she didn't show it to Xander, if you actually watch you can see she really did love him and she's had a good heart, it was just guarded) and Cordy actually helping Buffy in seasons 1-3 of Buffy's series Cordy did actually have a heart. It was just hidden under her trying to fit in, in high school until that's how you've become (in high school you don't really know how you are so you usually go with what feels comfortable or for a lot of people whatever makes you cool and popular, which was what Cordy had done). In season 1 when she was given the visions and that demon attacked her with all the pain of everyone in the world it started to change her (think, if you could feel the pain of EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE PLANET for God knows how long before Angel came and saved you from it, wouldn't you want to help them if you could)? Whenever Cordy got a vision she felt the pain, fear, and everything else that person was feeling and that would change anyone and it changed Cordy. Slowly, but surely. If you were to actually sit back and think about it and how you'd be in that same situation you might actually see how someone could care about helping others. Wes saw it in her because they became really close (like brother and sister) and Angel was so wrapped up in his own crap with Darla that he forgot about his friends and he didn't even notice that Cordy was changing. When Wes brought it to his attention Angel actually started to look at Cordy and realize it himself and if you notice in certain little gestures you could tell in season 3 he was going to fall for her.I'm honestly a Spike/Buffy, Angel/Cordy fan so I can't understand why people are so up in arms about the Angel/Cordy ship, but what Buffy and Angel had was more of a high school first love thing and what Cordy and Angel had was deeper. It was a friendship that grew into love and I honestly don't think any adult that went back and watched it would see Buffy and Angel as anything more then that. If you like Buffy and Angel together, you might just want to watch the Twilight series.

With Darla coming back and Connor's birth are the highlights of series' storyline. But when Holtz and his crazy desire for vengeance enter with its surprisingly slow progressing the show takes a downhill and the addition of Justine is not great either. Holtz is a bad villain, the way he talks, he acts, his actions and Justine is nothing but a weak bitch to love and obey him after acknowledging his deceptive ways. And season ends with another twist of Angel's son coming back all teenager and send him to a journey at the sea.But as for our favorite characters we're pretty much in for a treat. The addition of the lovely Fred is a major plus and the growing attraction between Angel and Cordelia is definitely something to look forward for. Wesley's dark turn in the mid-season is maybe painful to witness and needed for a character who was all worry-less. Cordelia's character development is one of the best I've seen on TV.So apart from the weak Holtz and overlong storyline, season 3 is a very good season with show offering its best achivements in character-based writing so far. My point is 8.3/10.

782905,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B0000TEW8C,kaduzy,"[4, 7]","If only I could give this TEN stars.  It's THAT GOOD.  You might think that because Buffy switched networks and could no longer support Angel with lead-ins, crossovers, or paired episodes like Season 2's ""Darla"" (Angel) and Season 5's ""Fool For Love"" (Buffy) that Angel would suffer.FAR FROM IT.Instead of weeping over their dearly departed Buffy, the writers and Angel himself dealt with no longer having her around by delivering the greatest season of television Joss Whedon ever had a hand in, in any show.As he deals with Buffy's death and his growing attraction to Cordelia, Darla turns up pregnant with his child.  That she is a dead demon who shouldn't be able to bear children is not really dealt with, but the plot hole hardly matters when stacked up against everything else that's going on.For one thing, Cordy's visions are getting more and more painful, and they are actually starting to kill her.  She finally slips into a coma as a result of one and winds up being given a choice between living her life without ever meeting Angel in LA and thus never getting the crippling visions from Doyle, or letting the visions kill her.  The episode, ""Birthday"" is a lot like ""The Wish"" in Buffy season 3 where she was able to see what life would be like without Buffy.  But this one avoids being a just a pale imitation largely due to the hilarious opening credits of her TV show ""Cordy"" (second only to Angel dancing in Season 1's ""She"" as the funniest moment of the series) and to Cordy's undeniable character growth in choosing to be less (or maybe more?) than human rather than give up helping people.Two minor characters shake things up, giving new definition to the saying ""Make new friends but keep the old.""  Finally out from under Lindsay's shadow, Lila Morgan comes into her own as a fantastic femme fatale who is completely out for herself and thusly completely unpredictable.  Sometimes she helps the gang and sometimes she really, really REALLY hurts them.  But one thing's for sure: she's not going anywhere, and she'll keep doing what it takes to survive.  An ""old"" friend from the past is the vampire hunter Holtz, suffering from being royally screwed over by Angelus and Darla who killed his entire family and turned his daughter into a vampire.  He's out for revenge, but instead of going for the kill, he goes for the pain, and succeeds in causing Angel more pain than anyone to date has.Another character who really comes into his own and makes this season what it is, is Wesley.  He's come a long way, baby, from the mealy-mouthed watcher we met in Buffy season 3.  In this season he's still the boss of the gang but his losing rivalry with Gunn over Fred adds more layers to his character, as do his actions regarding Holtz and Angel's son.Angel's fatherhood is the real crux of the season.  His character develops still further as we see more of his ability to love, his loyalties after all these years to his Irish roots (he wants his kid to go to Notre Dame, and objects to his name not being Irish), and MOST OF ALL, his heart-wrenching, jaw-dropping reaction to the loss of that child provides one of the best dramatic moments on television that I've EVER seen.  David Boreanaz and the show's writers should've gotten get Emmys JUST for the final scene in ""Forgiving"" which twists in a way I never could have anticipated, and changes the group dynamic for good.Other characters have their moments in the sun, including the long-underused J. August Richard's remarkable growth in ""That Old Gang of Mine"" and ""Double or Nothing.""  His relationship with Fred could be up for some controversy in more ways than one, but the producers never touch the race issue and instead stick to delving into issues like dating in the workplace and the lengths to which they are willing to go for one another.And the season is just jam-packed with great ""throwaway"" moments the writers come up with, like Lila casually filling an inkwell with her own blood for signing contracts at work and Fred calling Buffy's name ""peculiar"" only to have Wesley casually emphasize that HER name is ""Fred.""  Did I mention yet how awesome Wesley is this season????  Also deserving of a shout-out is Lorne, who we finally get to see more of once his club is twice-trashed.  (Okay, once trashed and once blown sky-high but who's counting?)  But as usual, the producers are extra-stingy with putting people into the regular line-up of cast members when the opening credits roll.  Buffy fans will remember with anger matching mine how they didn't do it for Tara until the episode where she was killed.  What I don't get is why even though Lorne's been a series regular a lot longer than Amy Acker has, she makes the cut but he doesn't.  Maybe they didn't want to give him dental?In spite of minor gripes about casting, the season ends with a cliffhanger that makes me wish I could run right out and buy season 4, but luckily I can't afford it right now.  If I spent another 22 hours glued to my TV to enjoy more of this amazing show, I would flunk out of college for sure.  So I'll have to wait at least another month, once I'm caught up in work.  It'll be aggravating, but well worth the wait -- this show has already got me asking ""Buffy who??"" and I can't wait to see how far this ballsy, gifted team of talented writers & actors will take

This six Disk DVD Set is extraordinary. The Picture and Sound quality are so very good that you feel as though you are watching it in a theater. The closed captioning and Audio come in other languages besides English. It's jam packed with all sorts of extra bonus specials. The Brilliant creator, Joss Whedon and other staff members are at their very best, just as they were with their work on Buffy (which is also a must own). I not only highly recommend this Season disk set, but the other four seasons as well. Quite a bit of quality work went into the making of all five seasons. They are a necessary buy for any Angel fan! It's completely impossible to be anything but extremely pleased with this purchase as well as the rest of the series. The writing, acting , directing, etc... are amazing per usual. This is without question once again feature film quality. The fact that all but the first season is filmed in Letter Box gives it that theater feel. In addition, the closed-captioning is less likely to interfere with the picture.David Boreanaz (Angel) and Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia) are brilliant in their performances together as well as the obvious sexual tension between them. They play it to the hilt. I personally would have liked to see them get together, but Joss Whedon as always had other ideas. Yet, another character was added at the end of season two, Amy Acker (Fred). She was rescued by the crew from Pylea, Lorne's home demon dimension. She joins Angel investigations, starting out a little bit on the crazy side. She grows into a pivotal member of the group. Amy Acker is quite a versatile actor. I must give extra credit to the incomparable Julie Benz (Darla, Vampire Extraordinaire). She was introduced at the end of Season One, brought back by Wolfram and Hart as Human. She does an exceptional job in playing the wickedly pissed off pregnant vampire and then redeeming herself in Episode 9 ""Lullaby"", by taking her own life so that her son may live. I'm aware that quite a few fans didn't like her until Lullaby, but I always thought she was incredible and was very sorry to see her go as a on and off regular. However, not to worry fans she will reappear now and again. As in many cases in the Joss Whedon universe the dead end up working again and sometimes more. I not only highly recommend this Season disk set, but the other four seasons as well. Any true Angel fan must complete their set with this one. It's a keeper folks.

782907,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000TEW8C,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[23, 25]","At the end of the second season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" when Buffy skilled Angel, the series reached its operatic height.  The climax was the culmination of everything that had been set up and provided a level of pathos rarely seen in network television.  During the third season of ""Angel,"" the counterpart to ""BtVS"" reached its height in a moment that was stunningly surprising.  But then the story arcs that dominated this third season were totally surprising.Season two of ""Angel"" had ended with the gang returning from Pylea only to learn from Willow that Buffy is dead (How good is Alyson Hannigan?  She just looks at Angel, never says a word, and it is clear what has happened).  Season three starts with Angel still in a bad mood after a long summer of mourning Buffy, but then three significant threads are revealed.  The first is a prophecy in the Nyazian scrolls, that predicts a being or an event that will bring about the end of time.  The second is the arrival of an immensely pregnant Darla (Julie Benz), who informs Angel that he is the father.  The third is the arrival of Holtz, a mortal enemy of Angelus and Darla, who has been brought from the past by the demon Sahjhan to kill them both.Of course, these threads all collide, and this is only the story arc that dominates the first third of the season.  Darla's pregnancy derails any romantic entanglement between Angel and Cordelia, the evidence of the one night stand with Darla adding insult to the injury of the gypsy's curse.  Then there are the complications of the pregnancy, which should have been impossible given mommy and daddy are dead vampires, because it turns out the baby has a soul and that Darla cannot deliver naturally (as if that has meaning at this point).This sets up the aforementioned great moment in ""Lullaby"" when Darla gives birth in the rain in the alley behind Caritas.  How great was this moment?  I basically told everybody I knew about what happened--we are talking people who never watched the show and had no interest in ever watching it--and they were all impressed by the power of the moment.  What impressed me the most was the performance during this season by Julie Benz.  When you consider how little there was to Darla during the first season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" the change in the character is impressive, but then on ""Angel"" that is par for the course: witness the transformations of Coredlia Chase and Wesley Wyndham-Pryce.  But I still think there was something special about the totally captivating performance by Benz.The Darla plot thread is replaced in the rest of the season by the Connor plot thread, as Angel has to learn how to be a single parent to a baby boy.  Holtz is still in pursuit, gathering his own collection of warriors to go up against Angel and his gang, and getting ever closer.  But the key development turns out to be the prophecy in the Nyazian scrolls, which is finally translated by Wesley.  The former Watcher discovers that the prophecy says that Angel is going to kill his own son, and with Wolfram & Hart spiking Angel's blood supply with blood from Connor so that the baby starts smelling like food to him, Wesley has to take things into his own hands and in ""Sleep Tight"" we have what you would have thought was a great season finale, but there are still six episodes to go.The final story arc has Angel dealing with the loss of Connor and then the surprise when his son returns, but not as a teenage demon fighter.  However, having spent years in a demon dimension being taught to hate Angelus by Holtz, this is not a happy reunion and it is payback time in ""Tomorrow.""  You look back at this third season and it is pretty impressive how much happened in these twenty-two episodes.  One of the reasons this season was so strong was that there was so much going on in terms of the show's subplots.  Having brought Fred back from Pylea, she develops an early crush on Angel only to become involved in a love triangle with Wesley and Gunn.  Then there is Lilah Morgan (Stephanie Romanov), who comes into her own at Wolfram & Hart now that she is no longer in Lindsey McDonald's shadow (e.g., ""Billy"").The make it or break it part of this season is the return of Connor all grown up.  I have to admit that I understand the grain of salt with which it needs to be taken with regards to how long can Angel take care of a baby?  Rachel has a baby on ""Friends"" and you can see how often anybody even remembers to talk about Emma.  So from a writing standpoint I think this a good move, as understandable as when Pam woke up and found Bobby alive in the shower on ""Dallas"" (it was the easiest way of getting things back the way they were).  Besides, Josh Whedon, Tim Minear and the rest of the writing staff were just pouring things on fast and furious by that point.  The only part that I had trouble with was Cordelia's ascension as a higher being.The extras are getting better on these DVD sets.  There is the expected commentary on ""Lullaby,"" as well as on ""Billy"" and ""Waiting in the Wings.""  There are a few deleted scenes, outtakes, and screen tests for the new kids on the block, Amy Acker and Vincent Kartheiser.  But the chief extra features are the featurettes, which include a ""Season 3 Overview,"" a piece on ""Page to Screen,"" and, my obvious favorite, a celebration of Julie Benz's performance in ""Darla: Deliver Us from Evil.""",5,Angel becomes a daddy and then things get really bad,1074816000,"01 23, 2004",2004,5398,"['end', 'second', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'when', 'Buffy',

782908,A2S9P70216QC2H,B0000TEW8C,"lenzino7383 ""BigBlue""","[0, 1]","After Buffy switch stations, this was a true test for the series as it had to survive on it's own on the WB with out its sister show for a change. Luckily the writers keep Angel a float at it enters in full swing with its 3rd season. Angel comes back home after a summer of grieving over Buffy's death (see Buffy's fifth season finale!) to return to his friends to continue his fight in L.A. But what turns out to be a usual year for Angel Investigations becomes an intense one when Darla returns 8 and half months pregnant with Angel's child! The mystery behind the possibly of vampire pregnancy is a shocking one as the gang, not to mention Wolfram and Hart try figure out what the unborn child might be. But just as the child is about to be born, an old nemesis from Angel and Darla's past returns to seek vengeance. It's an even darker year than the last as terrifying prophecy causes Wesley to even make the ultimate betrayal. Here's Season 3:Heartthrob-Weak episode!! ""After a summer of grieving over the death of the slayer, Angel returns home and stakes a female vampire he knows from his past. When her grief-stricken lover finds, he plans to take revenge."" The plot was dull, and the vengeance with James just seems forced in the end.That Vision Thing-Great episode!! ""When Cordelia's visions manifest as painful physical wounds, Angel and the gang investigate which leads to him make a deal with Wolfram and Hart to save her life."" You feel so bad for Cordelia in this episode, with all the disturbing marks on her body. Skip is also introduced in this episode.That Old Gang of Mine-Great!! ""Gunn finds himself caught between his old gang and the Fang Gang, when his former gang is the cause a series of discriminating attacks on innocent demons, which lead to an assault on Lorne's club."" Gunn gets some great development and Lorne's club gets destroyed again.Carpe Noctem-Weak episode!! ""An old man uses a spell to witch bodies with Angel, leaving Angel to die in his body and the old man to wreck havoc in Angel's body."" There are some funny parts, but the episode is pretty dull for the most part.Fredless-Pretty good episode!! ""When Fred's parents arrive in town to find her, she runs away in fear, leaving the rest of the gang and her parents to track her down while a large insect demon stalks them."" Amy Acker gives a heartbreaking performance and the insect demon is very creepy looking.Billy-Great episode!! ""A string of brutal attacks against women leads Angel Investigations back to Billy, the mysterious prisoner Angel freed to save Cordelia from her visions just as Wesley himself is soon infected by him."" Alexis Denisof gives terrifying performance as well as there are plenty of disturbing scenes.Offspring-Great episode!! ""Darla returns to L.A. 8 and half months and looking for answers from the daddy which Cordelia leaves hurt and taking Darla's side while the rest of the gang investigates on the pregnancy."" Julie Benz returns and is great as usual with Darla. The baby also has heart and a soul.Quickening-Good episode!! ""As Angel protects Darla and his unborn child, Wolfram and Hart plan to up duct the mother and child while a vampire cult wants the child for them."" We find out the boy is human and Holtz makes his debut.Lullaby-Amazing episode!! ""As Darla's goes into labor, she run off, leaving Angel to track her down so the baby can have a safe birth just as Holtz, the vampire hunter from the 18 century, tracks the 2 vampires down."" This episode is full of intense moments and the birth of Connor is a touching scene as Darla gives up her life for her son.Dad-Weak episode!! ""As Angel adjusts to being a new dad, he must protect his new son from the demon underworld who after the child."" The episode moves pretty slowly, although there is some touching moments with the baby.Birthday-Great episode!! ""On Cordelia's birthday, her latest vision puts her into a deadly coma; Skip guides her astral self as she chooses to live a new life as a famous actress but loses her life with Angel and the gang in the process.""  The alternate reality plot is great and Charisma's is flawless throughout.Provider-Bad episode!! ""An outbreak of business causes the Angel Investigations gang to split up as Fred solves a demon puzzle, Angel helps a business man, while Gun and Wesley protect a woman from her undead ex-boyfriend."" Pretty much nothing happens in this episode.Waiting in the Wings-Incredible episode!! ""When Angel takes the whole gang to the ballet, Angel realizes that the performance hasn't changed including the dancers he saw perform it a century ago."" One of the best episodes of the series that is full of stunning scenes and wonderful settings. Gunn and Fred become a couple here.Couplet-Weak episode!! ""Angel begins feeling isolated as the Groosalugg returns and wins everybody hearts by saving them including Cordelia who is falling for him."" The episode drags a bit with only some funny parts. Wesley uncovers a shocking prophecy.Loyalty-Great episode!! ""As Wesley continues to grow terrified as he tracks down the origin of the prophecy, Gunn and Fred investigate a vampire nest unaware that the woman who set them is working for Holtz."" This episode has some really shocking scenes and some hilarious ones especially the talking hamburger scene.Sleep Tight-Incredible episode!! ""When Angel's behavior turn frightening, he realizes his been drinking his son's blood leaving Wesley to protect Connor even if it means betraying his friends in the process."" This is one of the best and most shocking episodes of the series. It's so sad watching Angel lose his son.Forgiving-Amazing episode!! ""Bent on getting his son back, Angel uses the darkest of magic to try and rescue his son from the hell dimension his now in, while Gunn and Fred search for Wesley who is slowly dieing."" There are great special effects here as well as brilliant fight between Angel and Sahjhan.Double or Nothing-Pretty good episode!! ""As Angel is depressed over the loss of his son, Gunn and Fred find happiness in their relation just as repo-man appears for Gunn to pay up on the deal he made years ago which includes his soul."" Cordelia returns and has some great scenes with Angel. Even though the soul plot is dull, it was also great watching Gunn and Fred together.The Price-Great episode!! ""The affects of Angel casting dark magic in the hotel comes to haunt him and the whole gang when slimy slugs from another world are unleashed."" The slugs are very creepy looking, and there are some intense horror movie-like scenes.A New World-Great episode!! ""When Angel's son Connor returns from the hell dimension he is now a fearsome teenage warrior who escapes into the harsh streets of L.A., leaving his father desperately to go after him."" Vincent Kartheiser makes his first appearance as teenaged Connor and does well in his scenes with David.Benediction-Good episode!! ""Even as Angel and Connor begin bond as father and son fight side by side, Holtz has returned as well and decides leave Connor with his real father, just as Lilah works on recruiting a now isolated Wesley."" Angel and Connor show some great father/son chemistry and Holtz plans his final vengeance on Angel.Tomorrow-Great episode!! ""When Connor finds Holtz murdered, he and Justine plan to get back at Angel just Cordelia realizes she has fallen in love with Angel."" A great season finale with a shocking cliffhanger!Angel's 3rd season is a solid year full of shocks, deception, and betrayal that kept fans satisfied the whole way through. The DVD set has great extras including a season overview, a special on Darla, and selected commentaries with deleted scenes attached to them.",5,"The Miracle Child, Holtz and The Betrayal-Angel's

(for those of you who didn't watch the show when it aired, it was on on tuesday nights.) if you want to watch them all for the sake of seeing the whole show and following the entire plot to the end, i would borrow three and four. and then never watch them again. it's just bad tv.",1,angel,1226102400,"11 8, 2008",2008,1333,"['first', 'season', 'angel', 'very', 'good', 'great', 'cross-over', 'buffy', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'excellent-', 'fact', 'i', ""'d"", 'say', 'best', 'show-', 'episodes', 'season', 'three', 'as', 'far', 'i', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'was', 'start', 'downward', 'spiral', 'season', 'four', 'was', 'worse', 'season', 'five', 'only', 'worth', 'buying', 'enjoy', 'i', 'do', 'sparring', 'angel', 'spike', 'really', 'only', 'redeeming', 'thing', 'season', 'three', 'angel', 'acting', 'idiot', 'time', 'whole', 'conner', 'plot', 'seasons', 'three', 'four', 'just', 'headache', 'BAD', 'cordy', 'being', 'funny', 'chick', 'providing', 'comedic', 'relief', 'ditzy-ness', 'being', 'being', 'good', 'blah', 'blah', 'love', 'interest', 'angel', 'true', 'buffy', 'fan', 'could', 'possibly', 'approve', 'character', 'completely', 'uninteresting', 'i', 'really', 'no', 'longer', 'care', 'what', 'show', 'take', 'waaaay', 'seriously', 'one', 'best', 'thing', 'buffy', 'early', 'angel', 'fun', 'dawn', 'trouble', 'must', 'be', 'tuesday', 'ect', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'show', 'when', 'aired', 'was', 'tuesday', 'nights', 'want', 'watch', 'sake', 'seeing', 'whole', 'show', 'following', 'entire', 'plot', 'end', 'i', 'would', 'borrow', 'three', 'four', 'then', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'bad', 'tv']",N/A

The intro of Holtz as a villian was a terrific touch.Holtz and Lorne are really the greatest examples of the writers beginning to find their footing as far as creating a self existing universe independent of Buffy. The greatness of Holtz is that he has a genuine beef with Angel and is more a vigalante than villian.The character progression of Cordy and her relationship with Angel is great and much needed. It is nice to see Angel's jealousy over other men and his affection for Cordy growing. It is great to see that Angel still wants to connect with people on an intimate level and his ship with Cordy is unfairly bashed by Buffy/Angel folks.Fred is just a delight to have around and her love triangle with Wes and Gunn is angsty to the core. Poor Wesley goes through every emotion on the scale in Season 3 and you can't help but feel sorry for him.The characterizations are rich and detailed. The moral dilemmas are hard and uncompromising.

782916,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0000TEW8C,Mitch Weaver,"[6, 7]","I never managed to watch an episode of Angel while it was on television. However, I have been watching the show season per season on the DVD sets. The thing that has impressed me the most about Angel, is that the show has gotten better with each passing season. The first two seasons were excellent, but did not put Angel on the same level as Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Season three was the first season to really make Angel feel less like a spin-off and more like a show coming into its own. I was dragged into season three right away, and I was kept there until the end. With the acception of one bad episode, every episode in season three managed to be enjoyable.Perhaps one of the best aspects of season three, is the fact that Fred is established as a main character now and brought into the group. Amy Acker does such a wonderful job in the role and really makes Fred become an enjoyable character and pivotal part of the group. Season three also let us see a different and more darker side to Wesley as well. I do have to admit however that I was extremely skeptical at the start of season three, due to the fact that the main storyline would be focused around Darla being pregnant with Angel's child. But, it actually helps to drive the season forward very effectively. Season three also does a great job at showing that your past can come back to haunt you, when a vampire hunter named Holtz whose family was killed by Darla and Angelus, is brought over 200 years into the future to kill Angel. Holtz ends up becoming an extremely important character throughout the season which helps to make season three that much better.A few episodes worth mentioning in season three are ""Birthday"" which is a fabulous ""what if"" episode in which Cordelia gets to experience what her life would have been like if she had never run into Angel, ""That Vision Thing"" in which Cordelia's visions start to hurt her physically, ""Lullaby"" in which we see the final stages of Darla giving birth to Angel's and her son Connor, ""Sleep Tight"" in which Angel begins to crave for human blood, and his son Connor is kidnapped by Holtz into a hell dimension, ""Waiting in the Wings"" which involves a haunted ballet, and the season finale ""Tomorrow"" which supplies a cliffhanger that will blow you away.Overall, I enjoyed season three of Angel from beginning to end and it was the first season to really let Angel stand on its own away from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

782920,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B0000TEW8C,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[12, 12]","It's all too easy to state of Angel that it's not as good or as innovative as Buffy.  Whilst this is true in many respects, Angel Season 3 really sees things pick up pace, with the show no longer standing in the shadow of its sister show and creating a compelling, interesting story arc.  The opener, Heart-throb, sees the reappearance of Darla, pregnant with Angel's child no less.  The main storyline concerns the birth of Angel's son, followed by his loss and return as a 15 year-old!  However, just like on Buffy, Angel makes us care for its supporting players as well and it's notable that the story involving a renegade Wesley forced out of the group is still the show's best.Many fans disapproved of Connor as a teenager, and it's easy to see why.  Vincent Kartheiser, though a good actor, doesn't imbue his character with anything that makes you really feel sorry for him and never did for me until his final episode in the Season 4 finale.  This comes coupled with Angel's weakest villain yet, Holtz.  An old enemy of Angelus, who slaughtered his family years since, had himself brought into the future to wreak the ultimate revenge on Angel by attempting to first kidnap his son, and subsequently to turn him against him.  Put simply, he's boring, and we care far less what's going on when he's on-screen than when Lindsey was, or when Lilah's around.  However, this season sees some of the stand-out episodes that Buffy was so good at, with Billy and Waiting In The Wings.  Billy details Cordelia's increasingly painful visions and a guy who can turn any man into a homicidal mysogynist.  Simultaneously fleshing out Cordy's character whilst making a statement about abuse against women is done so assuredly that it comes across as one of the show's most impressive episode.  Waiting In The Wings was, of course, written by the master himself - Joss Whedon.  The gang take a visit to the ballet together and find themselves in a time flux that they can't get out of.  All of this is done with the kind of attention to detail (a classic ghost story, corrupted love versus true love, brilliant dancing) that marks it out as a Whedon episode.  Much more so than Buffy, Angel has a lot of surprise endings that really make you hunger for the next episode.  In particular, check out Angel's discovery of Wesley's plot to take his son, Wesley's realisation of what he has to do or the finale.  If you've never really thought of the character dynamics on Angel, you will after seeing Season 3 and the cast really spark off each other.  Above them all comes Alexis Denisof, who invests Wesley with such an interesting character that you completely forget the bookish Watcher from Buffy.  This season really gives him a chance to grow though, and for many he's become a favourite character.After a haphazard second season, season 3 really gives Angel a chance to grow as a show and sets things up perfectly for the spectacular season 4.  Significantly, Angel's got better with every season, much more confident about its own assets and began to get recognised in its own right rather than just as a spin-off.  And it deserves to, after 5 seasons and still going strong, Angel's one of the best TV shows around at the moment.",5,Standing on its own two feet,1074384000,"01 18, 2004",2004,3226,"['too', 'easy', 'state', 'Angel', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'as', 'innovative', 'Buffy', 'Whilst', 'true', 'many', 'respects', 'Angel', 'Season', '3', 'really', 'sees', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'show', 'no', 'longer', 'standing', 'shadow', 'sister', 'show', 'creating', 'compelling', 'interesting', 'story', 'arc', 'opener', 'Heart-throb', 'reappearance', 'Darla', 'pregnant', 'Angel', 'child', 'less', 'main', 'storyline', 'birth', 'Angel', 'son', 'followed', 'loss', 'return', '15', 'year-old', 'However', 'just', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'care', 'supporting', 'players', 'as', 'well', 'notable', 'story', 'involving', 'renegade', 'Wesley', 'forced', 'group', 'still', 'show', 'best.Many', 'fans', 'disapproved', 'Connor', 'teenager', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'good', 'actor', ""n't"", 'imbue', 'character', 'anything', 'really', 'feel', 'sorry', 'never', 'did', 'final', 'episode', 'Season', '4', 'finale', 'coupled', 'Angel', 'weakest', 'villain', 'yet', 'Holtz', 'old', 'enemy', 'Angelus', 'who', 'slaughtered', 'family', 'years', 'had', 'brought', 'future', 'wreak', 'ultimate', 'revenge', 'Angel', 'attempting', 'first', 'kidnap', 'son', 'subsequently', 'turn', 'Put', 'simply', 'boring', 'care', 'far', 'less', 'what', 'going', 'when', 'on-screen', 'when', 'Lindsey', 'was', 'when', 'Lilah', 'around', 'However', 'season', 'stand-out', 'Buffy', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'Billy', 'Waiting', 'Wings', 'Billy', 'details', 'Cordelia', 'increasingly', 'painful', 'visions', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'turn', 'man', 'homicidal', 'mysogynist', 'Simultaneously', 'fleshing', 'out', 'Cordy', 'character', 'whilst', 'making', 'statement', 'abuse', 'women', 'done', 'so', 'assuredly', 'one', 'show', 'most', 'impressive', 'episode', 'Waiting', 'Wings', 'was', 'course', 'written', 'master', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'gang', 'take', 'visit', 'ballet', 'together', 'find', 'time', 'flux', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'done', 'kind', 'attention', 'detail', 'classic', 'ghost', 'story', 'corrupted', 'versus', 'true', 'love', 'brilliant', 'dancing', 'out', 'Whedon', 'episode', 'Much', 'more', 'so', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'lot', 'surprise', 'endings', 'really', 'make', 'hunger', 'next', 'episode', 'particular', 'check', 'out', 'Angel', 'discovery', 'Wesley', 'plot', 'take', 'son', 'Wesley', 'realisation', 'what', 'do', 'finale', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'character', 'dynamics', 'Angel', 'will', 'seeing', 'Season', '3', 'cast', 'really', 'spark', 'off', 'other', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'who', 'Wesley', 'such', 'interesting', 'character', 'completely', 'forget', 'bookish', 'Watcher', 'Buffy', 'season', 'really', 'chance', 'grow', 'many', 'become', 'favourite', 'character.After', 'haphazard', 'second', 'season', 'season', '3', 'really', 'Angel', 'chance', 'grow', 'show', 'sets', 'things', 'up', 'perfectly', 'spectacular', 'season', '4', 'Significantly', 'Angel', 'got', 'better', 'season', 'much', 'more', 'confident', 'own', 'assets', 'began', 'get', 'recognised', 'own', 'right', 'rather', 'just', 'spin-off', '5', 'seasons', 'still', 'going', 'strong', 'Angel', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'shows', 'moment']",N/A

As the season comes to a close, the love triangle between Wesley (Alexis Denisof), Fred (Amy Acker), and Gunn (J. August Richards) explodes, and the super cliffhanger season finale has to be seen to be believed.  The cast of Angel excels in this season more than ever (I firmly believe that this is the best season of Angel) and the casting of Vincent Kartheiser as Angel's estranged son Connor is perfect.  Andy Hallet is plain loveable as the green skinned, karaoke loving demon Lorne, and Boreanaz is at his brooding best.  All in all, season 3 of Angel saw the show step out of Buffy the Vampire Slayer's shadow and stand on it's own as one of the best prime time TV dramas on the air.",5,Hitting it's stride,1090195200,"07 19, 2004",2004,1296,"['Just', 'show', 'was', 'spun', 'off', 'Angel', 'achieved', 'greatness', 'third', 'season', 'Beginning', 'Angel', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'mourning', 'death', 'former', 'lover', 'Buffy', 'vampire', 'soul', 'old', 'love', 'Darla', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'pregnant', 'child', 'evil', 'law', 'firm', 'Wolfram', 'amp', 'Hart', 'dismantle', 'everything', 'Angel', 'crew', 'have', 'built', 'Evil', 'seductress', 'Lilah', 'Morgan', 'Stephanie', 'Romanov', 'own', 'plans', 'well', 'Cordelia', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'destiny', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'was', 'Buffy', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'expected', 'season', 'close', 'love', 'triangle', 'Wesley', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'Fred', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'Gunn', 'J.', 'August', 'Richards', 'super', 'cliffhanger', 'season', 'finale', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'cast', 'Angel', 'excels', 'season', 'more', 'ever', 'firmly', 'believe', 'best', 'season', 'Angel', 'casting', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'Angel', 'estranged', 'son', 'Connor', 'perfect', 'Andy', 'Hallet', 'plain', 'loveable', 'green', 'skinned', 'karaoke', 'loving', 'demon', 'Lorne', 'Boreanaz', 'brooding', 'best', 'season', '3', 'Angel', 'saw', 'show', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'shadow', 'stand', 'own', 'one', 'best', 'prime', 'time', 'TV', 'dramas', 'air']",N/A

782925,A14AD0NQTRVVJC,B0000TEW8C,Patrick J. Sullivan,"[5, 10]","This long review contains numerous spoilers.The middle year of Angel's five seasons is a year of change. Lorne, having had his nightclub wrecked numerous times as a byproduct of the Angel crew's activities, essentially gives up on entertaining and joins the agency staff at the hotel. Fred becomes integrated into the Angel Investigations group. She and Gunn explore their feelings for each other, mostly unaware of Wesley's growing attraction to Fred. Darla makes her final exit, and Connor is introduced (gag). Cordelia and Angel start to develop romantic feelings for each other. Perhaps most significantly, Wesley's and Cordelia's characters become more complex even as Angel's becomes less so.As the season opens, Angel has absented himself from the hotel and gone on a spiritual pilgrimage to try to overcome his feelings of loss for the dead Buffy. After he returns, he realizes that much of his suffering stems from the fact that he truly hasn't been destroyed by Buffy's death. Sure it hurts, but where is the agony that Holtz still feels regarding his long-dead family? Is having a soul enough to make Angel truly a person in the same sense that others are?Complicating things is that Angel's and Cordelia's friendship seems to be turning into something else. Even before Darla, then Groo, and then Connor arrived on the scene to throw monkey wrenches into Angel + Cordelia, this was a romance I never wanted to see happen. Angel the show deserved to be more than just a soap where everyone hooked up with everyone else in turn. Cordelia had become Angel's strong right hand and his guide to the otherworldly. She was his lieutenant, as Xander Harris was Buffy's. That show wisely never tried to pair Xander and Buffy romantically, as it could never have worked out and only would have permanently tarnished their true relationship. I thought that the incipient romance between Angel and Cordelia risked going down that wrong path and I am relieved that at least it was never consummated.But Angel's schoolboy crush on Cordelia weakened the character. And as others have noted, his decision to do something about his feelings ignored the elephant in the living room: his curse. The whole tragedy of Angel is that he has to be alone. If Darla and Groo hadn't entered the picture when they did, what did Angel think he was going to do with Cordelia anyway? Live happily ever after?What worked best for the show was its brooding quality. In season three, this quality began to be lost. There were too many characters, and the constant presence of campy Lorne detracted from what was supposed to be the show's dark mood. I kind of like Lorne, and I like Andy Hallett as Lorne, but a show with Lorne and other kitschy characters popping in and out is not the Los Angeles noir Angel of season one, with its minimalist cast and set. For that matter, I like Groo, but he's just as jarring a fit in the supposedly dark world of Angel as Lorne is.Nevertheless, there were a number of plots that did successfully depict the shadowy Angel we expect to see. Buffy's death and return and Angel's resulting confusion pushed him off balance to begin with. While he's trying to juggle his feelings for Cordelia and Buffy, a pregnant Darla returns. The suspense over who or what Darla is carrying naturally ratchets the tension up. Julie Benz does a fine job in her swan song as a semi-regular. Feeling spillover from Connor's soul, Darla truly loves her baby, but the vampire inside her knows that once he's born and she is again soulless, she won't be able to love him and in fact will inevitably hurt him. She heroically takes the only way out.Angel is temporarily ennobled by Darla's return. He does his best to save not just their child but Darla as well. It is not his fault that she just can't be saved. Angel is at his best here when he is focused on Darla and Connor instead of mooning after Cordelia.The fully human Cordelia was never meant to endure the visions that the half-demon Doyle had bequeathed to her. The damage done by the visions is slowly killing her. Cordelia finds a way to save herself, but it means giving up part of her humanity. She is developing feelings for Angel, as he is for her, but when her old boyfriend Groo from Pylea shows up, she immediately jumps into his arms.Actually, the show's producers jerked the Cordelia character around quite a lot this season, a harbinger of how unfairly and inconsistently she would be treated in season four. Having her ascend to a higher plane at the year's end made no sense within the context of this season (she had only recently become part demon in order to deal with her visions, and anyway doesn't the whole point of her being useful depend on her being around in order to be useful?) Later explanations from season four perhaps explained her abrupt departure (though not very satisfactorily IMO), but as far as this season by itself goes, it was a senseless move.If Angel becomes lessened by the banality of his crush on Cordelia, Wesley becomes dramatically elevated in stature when he thinks he realizes what Angel is fated to do - kill his young son Connor. Wesley makes a terrible choice, but one he thinks is necessary, to kidnap Connor and attempt to go into hiding with him. Only in this way can he protect both Connor and Angel. If Wesley makes a mistake - and IMO he does make a huge one - it is in not sharing his concern with Cordelia and the others. Wesley is in fact being manipulated by Wolfram & Hart's Lilah Morgan. The supposed prophecy regarding Angel harming Connor is in fact a fake. If Wesley had consulted the others about what to do, perhaps one of them would have suggested the possibility that they were being played, and a lot of trouble and tragedy could have been avoided.But although Wesley is terribly wrong in the sense of being incorrect, he is not wrong in the sense of having bad intentions. On the contrary, he thinks he is doing the only thing he can to save Angel and the baby. It's understandable that Angel himself would be so upset that he would still see Wesley's actions as a betrayal and react with rage. Less reasonable is the way the others also shun Wesley as if he has deliberately set out to hurt Connor. They have all made mistakes too, and will make more. In season five, when Gunn does something deliberately selfish that helps cause a death, he receives instant forgiveness from Angel, as Angel knows he didn't mean to hurt that particular person (although Gunn knew he'd be hurting someone). But here in season three, Wes is a pariah to all despite his acknowledged lack of ill-intent.Holtz ends up with the baby and escapes to a hell dimension, where he raises Connor as his own son, though he does inform Connor of his biological parentage. To Holtz, this is only poetic justice. 200 years ago, Angelus and Darla killed his family, so it's fair that he steal their son. Time runs differently in various dimensions, and after a few weeks in Angel's world, a fully grown Connor returns from hell, to be followed by Holtz.This is all part of Holtz's complicated plan for complete vengeance. He has clearly never heard of the maxim, the best revenge is living well. The real use he has for Connor is to hurt Angel. Holtz frames Angel for his own murder so that Connor will turn against Angel. Connor predictably falls into the trap (one of many reasons the character is so unpopular). This does provide one of the most dramatic moments of the series, when Connor entombs his father alive at the bottom of the ocean.The whole Connor storyline moves way too quickly to be convincing. It's a bad soap clich&eacute; to have a kid grow up practically overnight. In Connor's case, it was literally overnight. And he doesn't experience nearly enough culture shock when he returns from his dimension to the modern world. There is a little confusion at first, but even that is too easily and quickly overcome. It isn't as if Holtz could have prepared him to live in 21st century L.A., as he himself knows only 18th century Europe.By season's end, Wesley is an outcast. His name can't even be mentioned at Angel Investigations. Only Fred tentatively tries to repair the breach, but Angel and Gunn aren't having any. This season is notable to me in that it turns the true tortured focus from Angel to Wesley.Yes, Angel is a victim here, but it is Wesley who must now experience lasting regret for his misdeeds. One thing that the return of Holtz did not do was prompt any similar regrets from Angel regarding Angelus's murder of Holtz's family. As Angel and others correctly point out, Angelus is not Angel. Once the vampire was ensouled, he stopped committing atrocities. Since today's Angel played no part in killing Holtz's family, it is impossible for Angel to ever meaningfully apologize or atone for that crime or Angelus's other offenses. This has always been a weak point of the entire atoning-Angel concept. I think even the show's writers get tangled up in the concept, which is why we sometimes find Angel apologizing and other times find him pointing out that that wasn't the real him, and that he's changed since then. There is no such ambiguity regarding Wesley's responsibility for his mistakes. Wesley screwed up, and Wesley must pay the price for screwing up.Season three is still fairly strong, though IMO not as dark or emotionally effective as the first two years. The show hadn't yet ""jumped the shark,"" but some of the worse plotlines involving Connor and Cordelia laid the groundwork for the more disastrous elements of season four, which would sound the series' death knell. The relentlessly cutesy style of the writing wore on me at times, too. It seemed like every week, the writers first looked for new ways to lightheartedly puncture the aura of gloom which supposedly surrounded Angel and his associates (it wasn't just Lorne and Groo, think of the friendly demon Skip, for instance). They seem to have forgotten that in order to have a momentary lighthearted relief from the pervasive doom and gloom, you have to stop with the jokes long enough to actually let some gloom settle in. Fortunately, Wes could usually be counted on to rain on everyone's parade.",3,A transitional season,1153267200,"07 19, 2006",2006,10200,"['long', 'review', 'numerous', 'spoilers.The', 'middle',

782926,A2Q4CZVCN5APDL,B0000TEW8C,Rick,"[1, 4]","This marked the first year ""Angel"" was separated from its parent show now that they were on different networks.  It rose to the occasion.  That's one of the greatest strenghts of this season and season four, there were minimum references to BTVS as the show and its own mythology stood on its own. It featured an epic storyline and great performances from the three core characters; Angel, Cordelia, and Wesley.  It may be Angel's show, but Cordelia and Wesley are nearly as important to the show as he is.  Both of these two characters did quite a bit of evolving this season.  Compare them both to their days on BTVS, and you can hardly believe they are the same characters they are now.  Another of the best things this season is the budding romance between Angel and Cordelia.  It was very touching and very believable.  Some people didn't get it, they said how can Angel and Cordelia become lovers after being just friends for so long.  That's why it's so believable.  People that are friends first and become lovers later are the relationships that last in the long haul.  Then there was the unfair resistance from the small but loud faction of fans who couldn't accept the fact that Angel and Buffy were history and didn't want Angel to be with anyone else.  Going back and watching these episodes now is really sad after Cordelia died in the 100th episode, the full potential of the C/A romance will never be realized.As for the villains this season; the main villain is Holtz on a quest for vengeance against Angel.  He's a bit of a bore.  But this is more than compensated for by the presence of two other villains; evil lawyer Lilah Morgan who has been around since season 1 and really gets to shine this season, and a new villain, the wickedly funny demon Sahjhan.  This guy cracks me up.  The biggest weaknesses in the main cast are Gunn and Fred.  Gunn is about the most boring one dimensional character in the Whedonverse.  Fred is uber annoying.  I didn't mind her when I orginally viewed these episodes one week at a time, but when you watch the episodes on DVD back to back, you realize how really annoying she is.  It's clear these two characters had limited potential, which is why Joss Whedon had to make radical character shifts on them both in season five. Whenever Fred and/or Gunn are on screen by themselves, hit fast forward.  Their presence is why I give this season four stars instead of five.  Must mention a couple of underrated good episodes: Carpe Noctem-Angel gets his body switched with an evil old man who runs around causing a bit of chaos in Angel's body while Angel is trapped in a retirement home, and A New World-Angel must deal with the return of his son Connor who utterly hates him.  Watch for Deborah Zoe as the blue haired sorceress Mistress Myrna.  That's a one shot character who should have gotten more appearances.  The extras are good, this is the only Angel DVD set where we get deleted scenes.  The three commentaries are all good, but for 22 episodes, more than three would be nice.

782927,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0000TEW8C,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[4, 5]","&quot;Angel&quot; hits the third season with a much grimmer atmosphere than previously, especially after the hilarity of the four-part finale of season two. However, it ended on a note of tragedy: as the gang push through the doors of their home Angel spots a solumn Willow seated in the foyer. Two words said it all: &quot;It's Buffy.&quot;Yet as temporary as the vampire-with-a-soul's beloved's death was, Buffy's death shook things up in L.A. for a while. After spending the summer in Tibet, Angel returns to find that somehow he still has the strength to go on fighting the good fight. This he needs, as a few shocking revelations are about to come his way. As you all remember (how could anyone forget?), last season Angel slept with his vampiric sire Darla in a state of despair, and now the consequences are back to haunt him. Despite the fact that vampires cannot reproduce, Darla is several months pregnant, and of course the evil law firm Wolfram and Hart are eagar to sink their teeth into this mystical/scientific impossibility. In the ashes of Darla's death comes the birth of Conner, who's destiny is a dangerous and tricky path.Meanwhile, Cordelia (who has come a long way since the selfish Queen C. of the first three &quot;Buffy&quot; seasons) has established herself fully as Angel's link to the Powers That Be, suffering increasingly painful visions in order to be of service to Angel - even going so far as to become part demon so that she might survive the painful ordeals.Wesley on the other hand becomes more and more enstranged from his family - after translating a horrifying prophesy concerning Angel's son he takes it upon himself to protect the newborn baby from harm. Hiding everything from his friends, he makes an uneasy alliance with Daniel Holtz, a mortal man transported through time with one heck of a vendetta against Angel. After Wesley's betrayal, Conner is taken through a portal only to emerge several days later as a fully grown teenager - with a bitter grudge against his father.Season Three of Angel brought in a new style of storytelling: when previously each episode had been made up of a singular mystery, Three began to meld each one into the other, making a long season-length arc. With this inevitably came the good and the bad.The good is that here begins a deep and complex storyline, drawing on many mythical and morale components, deepening our main characters, and taking them into realms we probably never saw coming. I mean, Angel as a father? Wesley and Lilah as a couple? Cordelia as an angelic figure? The fact that the creators can pull this all off in an interesting and realistic(!) way makes for evocative watching. I know many are not fond of the Conner storyline, or indeed of Conner himself, but I actually had a soft spot for Angel-Junior. It's not his fault that no one had the brains to sit him down and simply tell him that *Angel has a soul*. The closest he gets is Angel muttering: &quot;They're [other vampires] aren't like me.&quot; Whether you love him or hate him (and by the time Season Four rolls around, I admit you'll probably hate him), he certainly shook things up a bit. And I have to say it, but does anyone else think he and Dawn would make the perfect couple? Corny, I know, but think about it: both the &quot;children&quot; of superheroes, both with false memories, and both annoying as heck!As exciting and eventful as Three was, there were some things I didn't like, and I have to compare to its sister-show &quot;Buffy&quot;. There, the friendships of the main characters (Buffy, Xander, Willow) are the core of the show, and the affection between characters in &quot;Angel&quot; are also tangible in their sincerity. But in Three, things began to drift a little. What started as a sweet, almost father-daughter relationship between Angel and Fred is quickly neglected, and Wesley's refusal to share his troubles with his friends is baffling to say the least. I was never the least bit won over by the Cordelia/Angel love match (he left Buffy because of his curse and the fact they could never truly be together - what made him think he could do any better with Cordy?) and Wesley and Cordy's friendship also suffers: why did she never go to see him in hospital? I feel that Fred's visit when she tells him to &quot;never come back&quot; would have been ten times more powerful had it been Cordy saying these words, plus given a reason as to why she completely ignores Wes.But, despite these faults, Season Three is riveting stuff, filled with familiar reappearences, and ends on a note of both despair and strange hope, with everyone crying out for Season Four.",4,&quot;In All Those Years - Noone Ever Mattered.

782928,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000TEW8C,Robert Moore,"[266, 285]","Warning:  Lots of spoilers.Season Three of Angel remains, in many ways, my favorite of the show's run.  The shows are persistently good, but if I had to put my finger on a specific reason I like it so much, it is that the cast meshes together perfectly.  By the end of the season, there would be major--at the time seemingly impossible to mend--rifts between some of the members of Angel Investigations, but the core group was the best to date.  Angel, restored to the group as their spiritual if not technical leader, has recovered his sense of purpose.  Cordy (whose presence is missed mightily in the Fifth Season--I hope she and Joss Whedon patch up their differences and work her back into the show where she belongs--Note:  their differences, apart from the official rhetoric, apparently revolving around her leaving the show for a few episodes near the end of this season, and her delayed announcement of her real-life pregnancy in Season Four, causing significantly rewriting--my gut feeling is that she will be back after a period of &quot;punishment&quot;) has completely accepted her role as the contact to the Powers That Be, and both works hard at becoming a more important member of the team and manages to work a compromise to deal with the extraordinary physical toll the visions are taking on her (by becoming part demon--a gigantic step that one could hardly imagine the Cordelia of the first three years of Buffy making).  Wesley and Gunn are both taken by the new resident of Hotel Angel, Winifred aka Fred, the scientifically brilliant but psychologically traumatized young woman they had rescued from Pylea.  And finally, Lorne, formerly known as The Host, moves in when his karaoke bar has to close.  It is a great group, and the interaction between all of them is extraordinary.  And the romance! Well, the potential of romance.  Fred is initially smitten with Angel, her rescuer.  Wes and Gunn gradually fall in love with Fred.  And Cordy and Angel are both quite obviously growing closer and closer to one another.Against this background of interpersonal relationships, Angel unexpectedly becomes a father.  Darla, with whom he had had sex in Season Two in a futile attempt to lose his soul, returns to LA, in an exceedingly pregnant state, all the more remarkable for the fact that vampires cannot reproduce sexually (they reproduce through that biting thing).  The result is a cute baby Angel dubs Connor, which is all well and good until he is kidnapped and taken to a demon dimension, where he grows up to be an uber angry, obnoxious kid bent solely on revenging himself on Angel, who he has been taught to hate by the man who kidnapped him.  In the entirety of Buffy/Angel, the Connor story line might be the least popular in the history of the show.  Still, it doesn't keep this from being a very good season indeed.  Unlike most years of Buffy/Angel, Season Three is carried less by the season-long story arcs than by the individual episodes.  There are some great shows, and many marvelous moments.  The most harrowing might be the torturous decision that Wes has to make, and the enormous payment he has to pay for attempting to obey the dictates of conscience.One of my favorite moments in the season occurs when the writers engage in one of the great in-jokes in TV history.  On Season Six of Buffy, Buffy is so broke that she has to take a demeaning job slinging hamburgers and frying processed chicken product patties at a fast-food joint called Doublemeat Palace.  It is probably the most biting joke at the expense of the fast-food industry in the history of TV (especially ironic given the fact that Sarah Michelle Gellar's career began as a very small child in a famous series of commercials for Burger King explicitly attacking MacDonald's).  As a result of the Doublemeat Palace episodes, MacDonald's and other food outlets ceased advertising on Buffy.  Meanwhile, on Angel, Wesley is researching a prophecy and is striving to solve the last piece of the puzzle.  To do so, he needs to consult an idol in the shape of a statue, but when he goes to the coordinates, he sees not an imposing statue, but a personified plastic hamburger (think the Hamburgler from MacDonald's).  The image of a dumb plastic hamburger person being a powerful and all knowing entity is funny enough on its own, but knowing about the conflict with the fast food industry on Angel's sister show gives the scene an entire different dimension.The show ends on a spectacularly chaotic note.  Angel, unlike Buffy, has tended to end each year with far more loose ends.  Every season ends with as many questions raised as answered.  Of no season closer is this truer than this year.  The final episode sees Angel and Cordy, both obviously with strong feelings for one another, agreeing to meet on the beach near Malibu to &quot;have a talk.&quot;  (No mention is made about that nasty little curse afflicting Angel, which I found curious.  No curse and Angel would have been back with Buffy.)  But Cordy is unexpectedly called upon to become a Higher Being and ends the season by ascending into the Higher Realm, and Angel is bushwhacked by Connor and, in one of the most nightmarish moments in the show, encased in a metal cage and lowered to the bottom of the Pacific.  The season started off with everyone feeling pretty good about things, but ends with Cordy no longer on Earth, Angel on the bottom of the ocean, and Wesley recovering from a near-deadly wound and utterly alienated from all his friends.  And all of this sets up the utterly remarkable fourth season.",5,The best season yet of a remarkable show,1067472000,"10 30, 2003",2003,5584,"['Warning', 'Lots', 'spoilers.Season', 'Three', 'Angel',

782929,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B0000TEW8C,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[0, 2]","Frankly when I heard that Angel (David Boreanaz) was getting his own spin off, I was concerned this character as written . . . until that point would tank in his own series far away from Sunnydale and the Scoobies to provide critical support. As originally written, the Angel character was a helper and then romantic interest to Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) who had little additional depth.  After all, there is only so much that brooding looks accomplish before viewers start to wonder about any semblance of a plot.With Buffy's departure to the UPN, this marked the season when Angel became it's own show and hermitically sealed itself off from any mention of the parent show. Eliminated cross-over potential did not matter because this show found a balance between humor and horror keeping loyal viewers such as myself hooked, and always coming back for more.Openly celebrating series creator Joss Whedon's feminist degree and politics, The most griping episode is 'Billy' a transparent critique of the William Kennedy Smith rape trial/family culture which had encouraged many Kennedy men to engage in activities causing this event (while pointedly recognizing those men who want to end the 'tradition' but not yet knowing how to begin). According to the plot, sexism is not something men inately have in themselves, but an evil which must be conquered for all members of the human race to live happily with each other. Furthermore, sexism is so deadly that the usually benign Wesley Windham Pryce (Alexis Denishoof) attempts to kill Fred when she refuses his advances after he is touched by Billy.In hindsight, Season Three is truly when Angel became its own show and universe as opposed to something simply trying to cash in on the earlier established (and now fast crumbling!) BTVS empire. Even the superficially aborhent episode ""Lullabye"" where the previously remorseful Angel becomes a weirdly giggly daddy after becoming a single parent to Connor (previously thought impossible because of his being dead!) were not completly painful because the show had openly established itself as a commentary on the adult world which that earlier show could not hope to master.I also love Andy Halett's Lorne (the host of Caritas) who inevitably gets a larger chunk of time this season to read the minds of Angel Investigations and other visitors. He reminds me of a cross between Kermit the Frog and Uncle Arthur from Bewitched with the openly flamboyant smirk. For the time he was with Angel, Connor was so lucky to have had an awesome uncle like that.Because the show could no longer do cross-overs they further experimented with longer arcs beyond the basic redemption and survival scheme which had marked the earlier seasons. They are still very much outsiders especially when compared to the amassed resources of Wolfram and Hart, but Angel Investigations has become more routinized and sure of itself.Some of the episodes and concepts did not work, such as the vision gift (once a key to the show, but now faded into obscurity) which was supposed to have alerted Angel Investigations to danger, but this same abscence has not hurt the show in any discernable way.",4,The season when Angel becomes its own show,1072569600,"12 28, 2003",2003,3176,"['Frankly', 'when', 'heard', 'Angel', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'was', 'getting', 'own', 'spin', 'was', 'concerned', 'character', 'written', 'point', 'would', 'tank', 'own', 'series', 'far', 'away', 'Sunnydale', 'Scoobies', 'provide', 'critical', 'support', 'originally', 'written', 'Angel', 'character', 'was', 'helper', 'then', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'who', 'had', 'little', 'additional', 'depth', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'brooding', 'looks', 'accomplish', 'viewers', 'start', 'wonder', 'semblance', 'plot.With', 'Buffy', 'departure', 'UPN', 'marked', 'season', 'when', 'Angel', 'became', 'own', 'show', 'hermitically', 'sealed', 'off', 'mention', 'parent', 'show', 'Eliminated', 'cross-over', 'potential', 'did', 'not', 'matter', 'show', 'found', 'balance', 'humor', 'horror', 'keeping', 'loyal', 'viewers', 'such', 'hooked', 'always', 'coming', 'back', 'more.Openly', 'celebrating', 'series', 'creator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'feminist', 'degree', 'politics', 'most', 'griping', 'episode', ""'Billy"", 'transparent', 'critique', 'William', 'Kennedy', 'Smith', 'rape', 'trial/family', 'culture', 'had', 'encouraged', 'many', 'Kennedy', 'men', 'engage', 'activities', 'causing', 'event', 'pointedly', 'recognizing', 'men', 'who', 'want', 'end', ""'tradition"", 'not', 'yet', 'knowing', 'how', 'begin', 'According', 'plot', 'sexism', 'not', 'something', 'men', 'inately', 'have', 'evil', 'must', 'be', 'conquered', 'members', 'human', 'race', 'live', 'happily', 'other', 'Furthermore', 'sexism', 'so', 'deadly', 'usually', 'benign', 'Wesley', 'Windham', 'Pryce', 'Alexis', 'Denishoof', 'kill', 'Fred', 'when', 'advances', 'touched', 'Billy.In', 'hindsight', 'Season', 'Three', 'truly', 'when', 'Angel', 'became', 'own', 'show', 'universe', 'opposed', 'something', 'simply', 'trying', 'cash', 'earlier', 'established', 'now', 'fast', 'crumbling', 'BTVS', 'empire', 'Even', 'superficially', 'aborhent', 'episode', 'Lullabye', 'where', 'previously', 'remorseful', 'Angel', 'weirdly', 'giggly', 'daddy', 'becoming', 'single', 'parent', 'Connor', 'previously', 'thought', 'impossible', 'being', 'dead', 'were', 'not', 'completly', 'painful', 'show', 'had', 'openly', 'established', 'commentary', 'adult', 'world', 'earlier', 'show', 'could', 'not', 'hope', 'master.I', 'also', 'love', 'Andy', 'Halett', 'Lorne', 'host', 'Caritas', 'who', 'inevitably', 'larger', 'chunk', 'time', 'season', 'read', 'minds', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'other', 'visitors', 'cross', 'Kermit', 'Frog', 'Uncle', 'Arthur', 'Bewitched', 'openly', 'flamboyant', 'smirk', 'time', 'was', 'Angel', 'Connor', 'was', 'so', 'lucky', 'have', 'had', 'awesome', 'uncle', 'show', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'do', 'cross-overs', 'further', 'experimented', 'longer', 'arcs', 'basic', 'redemption', 'survival', 'scheme', 'had', 'marked', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'outsiders', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'amassed', 'resources', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'become', 'more', 'routinized', 'sure', 'itself.Some', 'episodes', 'concepts', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'such', 'vision', 'gift', 'once', 'key', 'show', 'now', 'faded', 'obscurity', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'alerted', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'danger', 'same', 'abscence', 'not', 'hurt', 'show', 'discernable', 'way']",N/A
782930,A2RFLE6TT1LZAT,B0000TEW8C,Rolf Hartmann,"[8, 11]","When I first saw this season on TV I thought it was really good but I had my problems, mostly Angel's ""relationship"" with Cordilia. On re-watching this season is so much better. So much happens this season and at a break neck pace much of the time. Good plots with inteligent and engaging villians (Holtz and Lilah Morgan are standouts) keep the season moving in great directions. The characters grow and evolve in interesting and often unexpected ways. Alexis Denisof as Wesley is a incredible especialy this season; the character is: versitile, multi layered, deeply good, yet hoplessly confilcted. David Boreanaz as Angel also does a great job; his happy times give context to his misery, and make him a more complete character insteed of staying as some two dimentional Buffy boy toy. Another great thing is the action, no other show (even 24) has action as good as ""Angel"" and this is the season where great attention started really coming into all the fights giving almost every episode a good action center piece; the fight at the begining of the episode ""A New World"" is better than any fight I've seen on any other show, on this show it's merely one of many greats. All this is great by itself, but this season is also perfect setup to the best season I've seen on TV Angel season 4.The picture and sound are a hell of alot better on the DVDs and the cinematic feel of this show is something that makes full use of the higher quality. Watching this in syndication it's show in Full frame, but the show was intended to be seen in Widscreen as a result sometimes faces are halfway off the screen during the syndication showings. Buffy was intended to be seen Full frame, but every Angel season except the first season was shot Widescreen.Ranking ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" seasons I rank this up there on level with ""Buffy season 2"" but just under ""Buffy season 3"", it's better than any other ""Buffy"" or ""Angel"" year except of course for what came on ""Angel"" afterwards. Sure there is no episode like ""Becoming"" but the overall year is much better than ""Buffy season 2"" so it evens out. One of the problems with almost all action shows is they hold way too much back over each season, so they can have mega episodes here and there; on Angel the events aren't held back which quickens the pacing, and makes the overall show much better.I own the R2 DVD so I don't know if there'll be more special features on the Region 1 DVDs, but here's the list of what I got:Commentary for ""Billy"" by Tim Minear and Jeffery BellComentary for ""Lullaby"" by Tim Minear and Mere SmithA very funny deleted scene from ""Birthday""Featurette on DarlaReally good series outakes reelCommenary on ""Waiting in the Wings"" by Joss WhedonAn almost too funny to be believed deleted scene from ""Waiting in the Wings""A fairly banale season overveiw featuretteA funny page to screen FeaturetteSome good screen tests for both Amy Acker, and Vincent KartheiserAnd a pictures galleryOverall some really good extras.

782932,A29CWGLEAS9AUN,B0000TEW8C,"R. Seehausen ""aeroblaster2""","[37, 42]","Many have called the third season of Angel a ""supernatural soap opera"".  I won't deny it, this season contains many elements that could cause it to be described as such.  But it's more than just that - Angel: Season 3 is a character-driven thriller of a story, intent on pulling viewers more directions than they can handle, all at once.The season starts out normally enough; though he has taken some time off to mourn the death of his old lover, Angel returns in a state much better than expected; indeed, no worse for the wear after the news of Buffy's death.Early in the season, the episodes remain mostly of the 'monster of the week' variety, alternating between humorous stories (""Carpe Noctem"") and darker narratives (""Billy"").  But the seasonal plot arc quickly kicks into overdrive when Darla arrives, pregnant with Angel's child and none to happy about it.Throughout the season, romances are developed between the show's major players.  At the forefront is Angel's seemingly unreciprocated feelings towards Cordelia, a development that drew as much distaste as it did intrigue among the viewer audience.  The first episode where this really comes into play, and in my opinion one of the best of the season, is the excellent Whedon-penned ""Waiting in the Wings"".  This episode also sees the climax of a love triangle between Wesley, Gunn, and Fred - the results of which are still sending ripples all the way into the early fifth season.As the season passes the halfway mark and begins to draw near to its conclusion, things heat up, with fewer stand-alone stories and more storyline episodes.  Things become so dynamic and tug the viewer so many different directions emotionally that you almost long to just have a break from all of the turmoil.You don't get one.  The season ends on one of the best cliffhangers ever seen on network television.This is one of my favorite seasons of any television show, ever, for its intensity, character development, and well-executed plot.  Make no mistake: this is one incredible buy for any Joss Whedon fan or anyone looking to get into his excellent shows.",5,Angel hits its stride,1066435200,"10 18, 2003",2003,2104,"['Many', 'have', 'called', 'third', 'season', 'Angel', 'supernatural', 'soap', 'opera', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'season', 'many', 'elements', 'could', 'cause', 'be', 'described', 'such', 'more', 'just', 'Angel', 'Season', '3', 'character-driven', 'thriller', 'story', 'intent', 'pulling', 'viewers', 'more', 'directions', 'can', 'handle', 'once.The', 'season', 'out', 'normally', 'enough', 'taken', 'time', 'mourn', 'death', 'old', 'lover', 'Angel', 'state', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'indeed', 'worse', 'wear', 'news', 'Buffy', 'death.Early', 'season', 'episodes', 'remain', 'mostly', ""'monster"", 'week', 'variety', 'alternating', 'humorous', 'stories', 'Carpe', 'Noctem', 'darker', 'narratives', 'Billy', 'seasonal', 'plot', 'arc', 'quickly', 'overdrive', 'when', 'Darla', 'pregnant', 'Angel', 'child', 'none', 'happy', 'season', 'romances', 'are', 'developed', 'show', 'major', 'players', 'forefront', 'Angel', 'seemingly', 'unreciprocated', 'feelings', 'towards', 'Cordelia', 'development', 'drew', 'as', 'much', 'distaste', 'did', 'intrigue', 'viewer', 'audience', 'first', 'episode', 'where', 'really', 'play', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'season', 'excellent', 'Whedon-penned', 'Waiting', 'Wings', 'episode', 'also', 'climax', 'love', 'triangle', 'Wesley', 'Gunn', 'Fred', 'results', 'are', 'still', 'sending', 'ripples', 'way', 'early', 'fifth', 'season.As', 'season', 'halfway', 'mark', 'draw', 'conclusion', 'things', 'heat', 'up', 'fewer', 'stand-alone', 'stories', 'more', 'storyline', 'episodes', 'Things', 'become', 'so', 'dynamic', 'viewer', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'directions', 'emotionally', 'almost', 'long', 'just', 'have', 'break', 'turmoil.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'season', 'one', 'best', 'cliffhangers', 'ever', 'seen', 'network', 'television.This', 'one', 'favorite', 'seasons', 'television', 'show', 'ever', 'intensity', 'character', 'development', 'well-executed', 'plot', 'Make', 'mistake', 'one', 'incredible', 'buy', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'fan', 'anyone', 'looking', 'get', 'excellent', 'shows']",N/A

After the events that occured in the previous season, Darla returns to inform Angel that she is pregnant with his child... Yeah. This season is full of surprises that actually surprise. The real drama doesn't even start until Angel's son Connor is actually born, but is then thought to play a part in what else but the apocalypse. Wesley betrays the group by stealing Connor only to have him taken away to a dimension where he grows up quite quickly and returns to this world as a young man. The characters go through some changes this season. We see both Angel and Cordelia take on roles as parental figures for the young Connor and Fred and Gunn's relationship begins to strengthen. Both 'Buffy' and 'Angel' season finales normally provide closure so this finale comes as a huge shock. Connor locks his father into a metal box and sinks him into the bottom of the ocean... Ouch.

I was really excited when I heard he would get his own show so I was really happy to watch the excellent first season of ""Angel.""The first season was everything I wished it would be so I was kind of disappointed with the episodes in the second season. The writers changed the simple ""Vampire-detective"" format from season one and they focused more on Wolfram & Hart and the supporting cast. It seemed (at the time) like the writers didn't know what to do with our favorite ""Vampire with a Soul."" Season three, in my opinion, sets everything right. It fills in the odd gaps from season two and it makes the overall focus of the series make more sense. It connects to all of the previous seasons perfectly and it really sets ups the fourth season in a excellent way.Wolfram & Hart say (in the first and second seasons of Angel) that a apocalypse is coming. They say that Angel will either save the world or destroy it in the end. Wesley (in the first season finale) says that Angel will become human after this apocalypse. This is more or less the overall story of the series. Season three excellently (and finally) addresses the overall story in the season finale when Cordelia leaves to become a higher being. She comes back (in the fourth season) possessed by a demonic force that Angel battles in the season finale after he finally averts the apocalypse by killing ""The Beast.""We wouldn't have an end to the four year ""coming apocalypse"" story if we didn't have the third season finale. The third season really sets up the excellent fourth season very well and it helps end one of the two major overall stories in the Angel series. Angel, in my opinion, has just one more story to resolve and that is the ""Shanshu Prophecy"" story. Will Angel finally become human or is Spike the Vampire that will find ultimate redemption? We'll have to watch this season and find out.This is a excellent DVD that really (speaking of redemption) redeems the ""lost direction"" writing from season two.

Darla having a baby not entirely interesting though Darla is interesting pregenant Darla is whiny and uninteresting.Second, Gunn and Fred love angle, another low point of the entire series, again the obvious love story between Wesley and Fred is put off for this very fake love story between Gunn and Fred.Third, I just can't get it out of my head Angel trying to kill Wesley while he was unconcious, one of the worst scenes ever in the history of Angel, its hard to forget or forgive.The fact I note so many people giving this season such high marks realy ignores these important points, I hope anyone thinking of purchasing this otherwise excellent series will take these points into consideration.",2,Connor is awful even has a baby,1069200000,"11 19, 2003",2003,923,"['Overall', 'Angel', 'great', 'series', 'hesitate', 'give', 'season', 'three', 'such', 'low', 'marks', 'lets', 'be', 'honest', 'Connor', 'was', 'mistake', 'huge', 'mistake', 'current', 'season', 'forgotten', 'never', 'mentioned', 'rarely', 'Darla', 'having', 'baby', 'not', 'entirely', 'interesting', 'Darla', 'interesting', 'pregenant', 'Darla', 'whiny', 'uninteresting.Second', 'Gunn', 'Fred', 'love', 'angle', 'low', 'point', 'entire', 'series', 'again', 'obvious', 'love', 'story', 'Wesley', 'Fred', 'put', 'off', 'very', 'fake', 'love', 'story', 'Gunn', 'Fred.Third', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'head', 'Angel', 'trying', 'kill', 'Wesley', 'was', 'unconcious', 'one', 'worst', 'scenes', 'ever', 'history', 'Angel', 'hard', 'forget', 'forgive.The', 'fact', 'note', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'giving', 'season', 'such', 'high', 'marks', 'realy', 'important', 'points', 'hope', 'anyone', 'thinking', 'purchasing', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'series', 'will', 'take', 'points', 'consideration']",N/A

To me, this season gives me this kind of feeling: "" I don't feel like watching it again, but if I think back, this season really does have great story arc and lots of important and deep things happened.""since I really don't have much say about this season- because it's my least favorite (well, if I have one that is), I'm just gonna point out the episodes that are my favorite:Heartthrob- the first episode of each Angel's season is always good, although I believe this season's season premire is my least favorite, but it's still one of the best of the season.That Old Gang of Mine- when Gunn's loyalty been tested, it was a great episode!!!Fredless- Reveals Fred's wounds, how she is in a denial and thinks she lives in a fairy tale- I LOVE THE IDEA!!!!Lullaby- the whole Darla pregnate sequence the only one I think is particular strong is this episode, when Darla sacrifices herself for the child and the conversation on the roof. I guess the reason I didn't like the sequence that much is because of Holtz- I really didn't like him too much. And the whole ""Angelus killed my family therefore I'm looking for revenge"" thing didn't appeal to me or make me sympathize for him because DUDE, you should know that when you are a vampire hunter it's a really dangerous job, you should've protected your family better. I mean DUH, of course Angelus is gonna come after your family, I mean, you've chased for Angelus for this long so what's Angelus gonna do? stand back and go like ""come and get me???"" If I were Angelus I would've done THE EXACT SAME THING. it's like you put your family in a lion's den and the lion killed your family and you blame it on the lion and seek revenge on the lion, god! if Holtz is smart enough to plan out such a cruel vengence for Angel, he's stupid enough to left his family and not leave SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS on who to invite in and tell his wife to watch his daughter???- STUPID!!! Anyways, I really don't feel holtz's character and watching him is probably the only times I feel frustrated or bored from watching Angel.Dad- when Angel fooled the whole crowd who come after Connor!!! WOW!!!Birthday- the turn for Cordelia and her choice!!!Sleep Tight,Forgiving- Wesley's stong point!!!!! and Angel trying to kill Wesley is also very shocking and very strong, it shows that although Angel can be more kind and forgiving than most people, he is still, deep down, a human, and can get really pissed. I mean, wouldn't you be when your ONLY child that you'll ever have gets kidnapped by your best friend and ended up in a hell dimention??? POOR WESLEY!!!that's about it, any ways, this season was a great lead-in for season four and five, worth owning and worth watching, and the cover for this season is like Dusk- before sun sets into darkness, which is a nice transition for season four- dark and green- evil rises. Dusk contradicts Dawn, which is season five.",4,"if I had to choose a least favorite, this is it",1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,3069,"['season', 'when', 'Angel', 'REALLY', 'DRAMATIC', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'dramatic', 'good', 'season', 'just', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'appealing', 'other', 'seasons', 'season', 'kind', 'feeling', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'watching', 'again', 'think', 'back', 'season', 'really', 'have', 'great', 'story', 'arc', 'lots', 'important', 'deep', 'things', 'happened', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'say', 'season-', 'least', 'favorite', 'well', 'have', 'one', ""'m"", 'just', 'gon', 'point', 'out', 'episodes', 'are', 'favorite', 'Heartthrob-', 'first', 'episode', 'Angel', 'season', 'always', 'good', 'believe', 'season', 'season', 'premire', 'least', 'favorite', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'season.That', 'Old', 'Gang', 'Mine-', 'when', 'Gunn', 'loyalty', 'been', 'tested', 'was', 'great', 'episode', 'Fredless-', 'Reveals', 'Fred', 'wounds', 'how', 'denial', 'fairy', 'tale-', 'LOVE', 'IDEA', 'Lullaby-', 'whole', 'Darla', 'pregnate', 'sequence', 'only', 'one', 'think', 'particular', 'strong', 'episode', 'when', 'Darla', 'child', 'conversation', 'roof', 'guess', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'sequence', 'much', 'Holtz-', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'too', 'much', 'whole', 'Angelus', 'killed', 'family', ""'m"", 'looking', 'revenge', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'make', 'sympathize', 'because', 'DUDE', 'should', 'know', 'when', 'are', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'really', 'dangerous', 'job', 'should', ""'ve"", 'protected', 'family', 'better', 'mean', 'DUH', 'course', 'Angelus', 'gon', 'come', 'family', 'mean', ""'ve"", 'chased', 'Angelus', 'long', 'so', 'what', 'Angelus', 'gon', 'do', 'stand', 'back', 'go', 'come', 'get', 'were', 'Angelus', 'would', ""'ve"", 'done', 'THE', 'EXACT', 'SAME', 'THING', 'put', 'family', 'lion', 'den', 'lion', 'killed', 'family', 'blame', 'lion', 'seek', 'revenge', 'lion', 'god', 'Holtz', 'smart', 'enough', 'plan', 'out', 'such', 'cruel', 'vengence', 'Angel', 'stupid', 'enough', 'left', 'family', 'not', 'leave', 'SPECIFIC', 'INSTRUCTIONS', 'who', 'invite', 'tell', 'wife', 'watch', 'daughter', 'STUPID', 'Anyways', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'holtz', 'character', 'watching', 'probably', 'only', 'times', 'feel', 'frustrated', 'bored', 'watching', 'Angel.Dad-', 'when', 'Angel', 'fooled', 'whole', 'crowd', 'who', 'come', 'Connor', 'WOW', 'turn', 'Cordelia', 'choice', 'Sleep', 'Tight', 'Forgiving-', 'Wesley', 'stong', 'point', 'Angel', 'trying', 'kill', 'Wesley', 'also', 'very', 'shocking', 'very', 'strong', 'Angel', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'kind', 'forgiving', 'most', 'people', 'still', 'deep', 'down', 'human', 'can', 'get', 'really', 'pissed', 'mean', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'when', 'ONLY', 'child', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'have', 'kidnapped', 'best', 'friend', 'ended', 'up', 'hell', 'dimention', 'POOR', 'WESLEY', 'ways', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'lead-in', 'season', 'four', 'five', 'worth', 'owning', 'worth', 'watching', 'cover', 'season', 'Dusk-', 'sun', 'sets', 'darkness', 'nice', 'transition', 'season', 'four-', 'dark', 'green-', 'evil', 'Dusk', 'Dawn', 'season', 'five']",N/A

782940,A2QSN9JTY9CLDW,B0000TEW8C,Tim Bare,"[5, 6]","Angel Season Three was one of the best of the stellar show's five seasons. While it wasn't quite the best (wait for fall 2004 and the release of the season 4 DVD and you'll see what i mean), but it did mark the show's divergence from the shadow of its sister show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It also shifted the focus from the more stand-alone episodes of the previous two seasons to the more structured storyline that would continue into the excellent fourth season.The season opens with Heartthrob, an episode that has Angel dealing with the death of Buffy, as well as facing an old friend from his demonic past, who returns as an enemy out for vengeance against Angel for killing his lover. The episode finally allows Angel to put Buffy behind him and move on. The season's main arcs are introduced in the next few episodes, dealing with the worsening of Cordelia's visions, the deepening feelings of Cordelia and Angel for one another, Darla's pregnancy with Angel's son (a birth by two vampires, an unprecedented event), the Wesley-Fred-Gunn love triangle, and the reappearance of the 18th century vampire hunter Daniel Holtz, who makes a pact with the demon Sahjhan to return in the 21st century to avenge his family, who Angel brutally murdered before being re-ensouled.The season is incredibly well-written, showing Angel coming to terms with fatherhood and growing to deeply love his son. It shows Wesley sinking slowly into darkness as he is forced to betray Angel in an effort to do the right thing. It shows Lilah Morgan of Wolfram and Hart finally begin to show glimpses of inner conflict. And it shows Holtz, a potrait of a man consumed by hatred, with nothing left but a thirst for vengeance which he will do anything to satisfy.Although the best part of this season is the main story arc, there are several excellent stand-alone episodes, including That Old Gang of Mine, where Gunn must finally choose between Angel Investigations and his old gang; Billy, where, infected by a demon who Angel freed from hell to save Cordelia, Wesley stalks Fred through the hotel with an axe; and Waiting in the Wings, where Cordelia and Angel fall under a spell and are possessed by the spirits of dead lovers and eventually save a ballerina who has been pulled out of time.Season Three of Angel showed that the show could survive on its own, and since the show has surpassed the show that spawned it with the stellar fourth and fifth seasons.

Buffy was always the more simple and straight-forward centerpiece of the Whedonverse.  Metaphors have always been plainer and characters less complex.  Buffy is a weekly motion picture.  Angel, on the other hand, is a novel being translated to the screen.  The first two seasons of Angel were the prologue.  Season Three is the testament, the required reference material needed to pass the class.  Watching this DVD boxed set of 22 episodes, I remembered just how absolutely gripping it was to watch them on the original air dates.  There was something about how the writers structured the plots this season that seem to stretch the alloted 43 minutes much longer.  Conventional &quot;we killed the bad guy&quot; climaxes often happened earlier, leaving room for big emotional payoffs and character-related events.  In effect, each episode had multiple climaxes.  This is the strongest DVD release in the Buffy/Angel series so far, with picture quality that is richer and less grainy than any of the other releases, previously unavaible but much wanted goodies like screentests and, finally, a Darla featurette (which is less informative than it is commemerative).

782943,A2GUVU889LA2O,B0000TEW8C,"Woo Kim ""Woo S. Kim""","[1, 2]","It's buffy.  That was how the second season ended and quite honestly we didn't know how Angel was going to react to this for two reasons. Buffy the Vampire Slayer's leaving the WB (now CW) for the UPN Network (now also CW).  The other reason being, Buffy was the love of his life.  While being that BTVS was not on the WB anymore the Angel writers could only reference what happen to Buffy in very subtle ways.  This season third season of Angel is very similar to the sixth season BTVS.  Both seasons begin just getting things back together, getting both groups back together again.  Very much normal episodes about the struggles of everyday life and reality.  Although by the time we get to ""Waiting in the Wings"" which is on disk three, team Angel begins to slowly break apart.  The special features on this set are all right.  Once again, I've said this on other reviews don't watch any of the special features or the commentaries until you've watched the entire season.  The reason you should buy the slim set rather then the bulky original box set is because the slim set has it's disks in three seperate containers which helps them from not becoming damaged.  Also, the slim set has the exact same features then the original bulky box set.  Lastly, if you're really into the audio commentaries do not listen to any of them by writer, director Tim Minear.  He even says he does commentaries for the blind.  Meaning he tells the audience what they are already looking at.  Overall, the episodes this season really begin a solid run for the remainder of the series highlighted by ""Waiting in the Wings""  Guest starring Summer Glau as the ballerina (aka River on Firefly and Serenity).  If you really love commentaries listen to the one by Angel series co creator Joss Whedon on ""Waiting in the Wings"" very insightful.

They are dynamic together.  Best Cliff-Hanger ever!  I you don't like cliff-hangers you'll hate this.  So sad for you...I'd recomend the show over Buffy any day!  Buy it!,5,yeah,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,299,"['have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'single', 'season', 'Angel', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'Buffy.The', 'cast', 'fit', 'one', 'season', 'are', 'dynamic', 'together', 'Best', 'Cliff-Hanger', 'ever', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'cliff-hangers', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'So', 'sad', ""'d"", 'recomend', 'show', 'Buffy', 'day', 'Buy']",N/A
