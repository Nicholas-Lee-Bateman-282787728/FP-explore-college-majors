Things look pretty bleak nearing the Thanksgiving Holiday and the children, wishing to have a nice Thanksgiving Day dinner for their mom decide, without their mothers knowledge, to turn to their heretofore estranged but wealthy Grandmother for help in making their wish come true.

It's not ""Little Women"" by L.M.Alcott, but you get a lot of the feel of that book as well. There is confrontation between all generations, and love as well. It takes struggle, and a Thanksgiving climax, to bring it all together into the homey cozy ending that all love.My favorite was actually the middle generation, Mary (Helene Joy) who I first encountered over several years playing a similar roll, only in ""Murdoch Mysteries"" she is a full fledged doctor, and does the nasty autopsy work for solving crimes. In the Thanksgiving film, she's healing when the real doctor is unavailable. In both roles, she plays the tough gal, but with a secret softer heart. You must see those Murdoch Mysteries, also period drama.Daughter Matilda is played by Tatiana Maslany who does a remarkable job with the role, although not a novice in film. 2 years later she steps up to play Mary in ""The Nativity"", another film worth your while. Of course the intended lead was rich Granny Isabella, played by Jacqueline Bisset. She's nasty and then turns sweet. She is grande, and her costumes even grander, she being the richest person of the characters. She got all the fanciest frocks. The rest of the period costumes and sets and props were expertly done making this quite an enjoyable and nostalgic romp back into the past.A fun family film, good for all ages, and stunning camera vistas. Some 'making of' bonus was fun to watch also.SUBTITLES & CC ARE PROVIDED FOR THOSE WHO NEED THEM.Now I wait for Hallmark Channel's ""An Old Fashioned Christmas"" staring Billet again as Isabella and Catherine Steadman as the granddaughter.

Throw in a little romance, a disapproving neighbor,  sisterly jealousy, a scandalous past, poverty, scarlet fever, and a rambunctious little boy, all woven around the Thanksgiving season and you have a story that will hold your interest.In one scene the young widow accuses her mother of having married her father (who was quite a bit older) for his money and only had a child (herself) so that his older children from a previous marriage could not contest the will.

1268368,A1FCBJNIFF4PPU,B002GYHIYE,prairie woman,"[1, 2]","I have watched other Hallmark movies before but this one was a bit of a disappointment.  This isn't the first story of a daughter estranged from her mother, but this one is just a bit annoying to watch as we see this character, Mary played by Helene Joy who is otherwise a very talented actress.  I do remember her from the Murdoch Mysteries as the doctor, so I was a bit amazed that she was put in this role of a long suffering, martyr type who would allow her family to almost starve rather than ask for help.  Not only that she puts herself in harm's way as the only parent left who goes out to minister to people with scarlet fever and in fact contracts the illness herself.  Jaqueline Bissett as the mother/grandmother was stunning as usual.  The woman just gets more beautiful with age.  She brings some color, joy, and a bit of ""stirring up"" to this mix of depressed victims in this story.  The scene where she addresses the wife of a neighbor who is wearing black for sons that died some years earlier.  Isabelle tells her that she deserves to have some enjoyment in her life, get out of the widow weeds and have a party!  I could see this being a Louisa Mae Alcott penning because some of the Little Women characters are similar, like Tilly, who resembles Jo in her strength, independence, and love of writing.  The mother certainly is not Marmi because she is just dreary all the time, is resentful of her mother, and is almost angry that she is now left to provide for these children, and also make them all feel guilty for how hard she works.  I guess that's part of the lesson of the story to accept, forgive, take delight in your friends and family, and be thankful that life isn't much worse.",3,A Very Trying Thanksgiving!,1348704000,"09 27, 2012",2012,1707,"['have', 'watched', 'other', 'Hallmark', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointment', ""n't"", 'first', 'story', 'daughter', 'estranged', 'mother', 'one', 'just', 'bit', 'annoying', 'watch', 'see', 'character', 'Mary', 'played', 'Helene', 'Joy', 'who', 'otherwise', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'do', 'remember', 'Murdoch', 'Mysteries', 'doctor', 'was', 'bit', 'amazed', 'was', 'put', 'role', 'long', 'suffering', 'martyr', 'type', 'who', 'would', 'allow', 'family', 'almost', 'starve', 'rather', 'ask', 'help', 'Not', 'only', 'harm', 'way', 'only', 'parent', 'left', 'who', 'out', 'minister', 'people', 'scarlet', 'fever', 'fact', 'contracts', 'illness', 'Jaqueline', 'Bissett', 'mother/grandmother', 'was', 'stunning', 'as', 'usual', 'woman', 'just', 'more', 'beautiful', 'age', 'color', 'joy', 'bit', 'stirring', 'up', 'mix', 'depressed', 'victims', 'story', 'scene', 'where', 'wife', 'neighbor', 'who', 'wearing', 'black', 'sons', 'died', 'years', 'earlier', 'Isabelle', 'have', 'enjoyment', 'life', 'get', 'widow', 'weeds', 'have', 'party', 'could', 'see', 'being', 'Louisa', 'Mae', 'Alcott', 'penning', 'Little', 'Women', 'characters', 'are', 'similar', 'Tilly', 'who', 'Jo', 'strength', 'independence', 'love', 'writing', 'mother', 'certainly', 'not', 'Marmi', 'just', 'dreary', 'time', 'resentful', 'mother', 'almost', 'angry', 'now', 'left', 'provide', 'children', 'also', 'make', 'feel', 'guilty', 'how', 'hard', 'guess', 'part', 'lesson', 'story', 'accept', 'forgive', 'take', 'delight', 'friends', 'family', 'be', 'thankful', 'life', ""n't"", 'much', 'worse']",N/A

I had not heard of this story by Louisa May Alcott, and if you are a fan of Little Women, I can only predict that you will be thrilled to find this movie.  The acting is excellent, particularly the young lady who plays Tilly, and Jacqueline Bisset of course dominates the screen every time she appears.  Like Little Women, there is sorrow mixed in with the joy.  I imagine younger children will find it slow going, but I was mesmerized.  Two caveats - the sound quality is not always the best, and some lines are hard to understand.  Also there were a couple of times when I didn't quite understand what was going on, including the very beginning.  I did figure it out eventually, and it did not detract from my enjoyment of the movie.  It feels very authentic, and I look forward to watching it every year as a Thanksgiving tradition.",5,A wonderful movie to get lost in,1258934400,"11 23, 2009",2009,908,"['stunning', 'opening', 'shots', 'snow', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'was', 'hooked', 'had', 'not', 'heard', 'story', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'are', 'fan', 'Little', 'Women', 'can', 'only', 'predict', 'will', 'be', 'thrilled', 'find', 'movie', 'acting', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'Tilly', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'course', 'screen', 'time', 'Little', 'Women', 'sorrow', 'mixed', 'joy', 'imagine', 'younger', 'children', 'will', 'find', 'slow', 'going', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'Two', 'caveats', 'sound', 'quality', 'not', 'always', 'best', 'lines', 'are', 'hard', 'understand', 'Also', 'were', 'couple', 'times', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'including', 'very', 'beginning', 'did', 'figure', 'out', 'eventually', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'very', 'authentic', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'year', 'Thanksgiving', 'tradition']",N/A

The film has very strong period setting with what looked like real snow not that fake movie snow and it felt  very cold, The film has a realistic feel in terms of the precarious nature of life at this time, in terms of obtaining enough food to eat, the proper clothing to protect oneself from the elements. If someone asks about your health, it's not a casual remark, you could get very sick in a matter of hours. Tillie, the eldest child, has a vivid imagination, setting up scenes, like little one act plays, commenting on the outcome for good or ill. The grandmother steals herself into their lives with money and  gifts, the widowed mother had rejected her mother many years before and for good reason.
