This season is better, but the interface is still has few frills. Every time you continue playing the disks from the time before, you end up sitting through their opening promo and FBI warnings.  Attempts to move ahead are troublesome. Quite often things just get stuck.I am familiar with playing devices, I have tried the disks on a different player, and all of my equipment is quite new. For some reason, the quality of disks is just lacking. It is unfortunate, as I like this show.

If you watch, the absolute quality of the writting and acting that makes this show one of the best in televison, ever, will be immediately revealed.But I picked 1994-1995 Law and Order specifically. It was the season Jerry Orbach truely nailed the essense of the great Lenny Briscoe. The year Lt. Van Burean became a staple. Most important, the officious Ben Stone was replaced by the bucking bronco, Jack McCoy. Law and Order as we know it starts here.Law and Order is really great New York stage with great New York Stage actors, and the show has never deviated from this. The brillance is in how each twist in the show sets the next four, perfectly. The way the most offhand comments are planted and prove to be keys to solving the crime. The way the crimes imply bigger social issues: these smart charactors sometimes debate the issues, as smart people do, but never in a way that sounds contrived or accidemic. You have to be smart to get the show, becuase Law and Order is so smart. It talks up to you, never down.I was recently watching a 20th aniversery documentry on the show. Jeramy Sisto said that if you want to understand New York, and America, in our times, watch Law and Order: you'll see the high crime, crack infested, New York. The cleaned up, Gulianni, Nasdaq rocketing New York. New York experiancing and trying to come to grips with 9/11, and finally, the Bloomberg New York we know in 2009; recovered, but still dealing with incremental after shocks.Stone, McCoy, Shiff, Lewin, Brnach, Kincaid, Ross, Caremichal, Southerland Cutter, Rubarosa. Law and Order has run our times through so many different perspectives, we can't help but watch it over and over both as history and drama. (And you gotta admit, all the assistants have been lookers. No wonder Jack got himself into trouble, at least before Kinkaid died)You rarely see them at home. These people rarely show a soft side, forgiveness, pity. You always know it is there. Some are probably teddy bears after five o'clock. But these people are at work, and the work is to put very bad people in a very bad place--brass nuckles required.. It is waiting to see the occasional humaness of the charactors that keeps me watching.Sisto, Anderson and Roche are great actors, and , this show still works. I will always watch. But I miss Briscoe, and that young, black haired maneater McCoy, grinding the sausage at any cost. If you feel that way, get 1994-1995.

1044430,A2B7SS9OH87HLR,B000MCH5AO,Boston Reader,"[0, 0]","An opposite from the conservative Ben Stone, this prosecutor drives a motorcycle and loves to win his cases. But that does not stop him from gaining true justice. He will not accept a martyr, sacrificing himself for someone he loves just so he could win the case. But he is ready to prosecute anyone to the full extent of the law, including police officers as seen in ""Competence"" as he believes that they should be held to a higher standard. There seems to be some sort of flirtatious relationship between him and ADA Kincaid and maybe even more. But to focus on that would be like saying that Stabler and Benson's flirtatious relationship is more important to the show than the actual show. The controversial issues mentioned in the episodes this season include an off-duty police shooting, treatments in the mental healthcare system, rape/sex in high schools, repressed memories of childhood molestation by a priest, gay rights and abortion. Some these subjects are still a hot topic in modern times and should be looked back at to see how much has changed (or hasn't changed in some cases.) Another reason to get this season is because this is the last time we will Chis Noth as Detective Mike Logan on Law & Order. He would have sent on to repraise his character in the TV movie Exiled, and then return as a regular in Criminal Intent's 5th year after guest starring in the 4th. This is the first season to be released on the widescreen format to be played on HDTV's and laptops as well as the conventional TV sets. Also Dan Floreck, like in season 4, directs an episode in this season, but unlike in year four, he guest stars as his character, Captain Donald Cragen. Get this season on DVD to see what some would consider the ""Law & Order Dream Team"" tackle the tough cases and hard-hitting topics that still question our existence as human beings today.",5,Enter Jack McCoy,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,1860,"['opposite', 'conservative', 'Ben', 'Stone', 'prosecutor', 'motorcycle', 'win', 'cases', 'not', 'stop', 'gaining', 'true', 'justice', 'will', 'not', 'accept', 'martyr', 'sacrificing', 'someone', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'win', 'case', 'ready', 'prosecute', 'anyone', 'full', 'extent', 'law', 'including', 'police', 'officers', 'seen', 'Competence', 'should', 'be', 'held', 'higher', 'standard', 'be', 'sort', 'flirtatious', 'relationship', 'ADA', 'Kincaid', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'focus', 'would', 'be', 'saying', 'Stabler', 'Benson', 'flirtatious', 'relationship', 'more', 'important', 'show', 'actual', 'show', 'controversial', 'issues', 'mentioned', 'episodes', 'season', 'include', 'off-duty', 'police', 'shooting', 'treatments', 'mental', 'healthcare', 'system', 'rape/sex', 'high', 'schools', 'repressed', 'memories', 'childhood', 'molestation', 'priest', 'gay', 'rights', 'abortion', 'subjects', 'are', 'still', 'hot', 'topic', 'modern', 'times', 'should', 'be', 'looked', 'back', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'changed', ""n't"", 'changed', 'cases', 'reason', 'get', 'season', 'last', 'time', 'will', 'Chis', 'Noth', 'Detective', 'Mike', 'Logan', 'Law', 'Order', 'would', 'have', 'sent', 'repraise', 'character', 'TV', 'movie', 'Exiled', 'then', 'return', 'regular', 'Criminal', 'Intent', '5th', 'year', 'guest', 'starring', '4th', 'first', 'season', 'be', 'released', 'widescreen', 'format', 'be', 'played', 'HDTV', 'as', 'well', 'conventional', 'TV', 'sets', 'Also', 'Dan', 'Floreck', 'season', '4', 'episode', 'season', 'year', 'four', 'guest', 'stars', 'character', 'Captain', 'Donald', 'Cragen', 'Get', 'season', 'DVD', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'Law', 'Order', 'Dream', 'Team', 'tough', 'cases', 'hard-hitting', 'topics', 'still', 'question', 'existence', 'human', 'beings', 'today']",N/A
1044431,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000MCH5AO,calvinnme,"[17, 17]","This season marks the first season with Sam Waterston playing the role of executive assistant district attorney Jack McCoy. Jack replaces Michael Moriarty's Ben Stone, who had held the position of lead prosecutor for the first four seasons. Waterston turns out to be a great addition to the cast. It's not that he is better or worse in the role than Moriarty - he's just different. Moriarty's Ben Stone was more of the crusader, where Waterston's Jack McCoy is more out to right specific wrongs rather than ""make new law"", which was often Stone's objective. Once again the cast has great chemistry. We have what is probably the finest old cop/young cop partnership in the history of TV in Lenny Briscoe and Mike Logan, the two DA's Jack and Claire have great chemistry to the point that you are kept guessing as to whether or not anything more ever goes on between the two of them than just business, S. Epatha Merkerson is commanding and thorough as Lieutenant Van Buren, and then of course there is Steven Hill as the actual elected District Attorney and his memorable one liners and reflections that add just a pinch of needed spice to each episode.The episodes are of high caliber too. The one that always comes to my mind is ""Coma"". This is one of the few L&O; episodes where the actual murder is solved, but you know there has to be more to the story of what appears to be a murder for hire. Unfortunately, the actual murderer is a pseudo street person who has just died of natural causes when he is found out. The problem is, the husband of the victim is the actual suspect. He is arrogant and extremely guilty looking with the exception of that pesky problem of evidence. This case is revisited in season six. ""Performance"" is an extremely complex episode when what begins as an investigation into what appears to be an actual murder made into a movie turns into an investigation of an entire social order between teenagers in which boys get points for ""conquests"" of girls and the girls go along with it so they aren't made outcasts. The excellent ""Second Opinion"" is the bizarre case of a woman who collapses, and as she is being worked on in the emergency room releases toxic fumes that cause the loss of consciousness of several of the workers there. The case gets traced back to a doctor who is administering an unorthodox treatment for breast cancer. McCoy wants to prosecute, but when he sends Claire out to talk to women who have been patients we see that there are definitely two sides to the story. On one hand, there are all of the women who managed to avoid the scarring and horrors of chemotherapy and seem to be doing very well. However, there is also the fact that Claire can't interview quite a few of the patients because they are deceased. The whole episode brings up the argument of, in such a personal choice, whose decision is it anyway when it comes to the course of treatment to pursue.""House Counsel"", although it seems to be ""ripped from the headlines"" in the sense that it resembles the case of John Gotti's lawyer being disqualified because he was deemed too involved in Gotti's activities, actually is a pretty original episode. Here we get one of our first looks into the complexity that is Jack McCoy. He prosecutes a defense attorney for conspiracy to commit murder in the case of a juror in a mob trial who was paid off in exchange for voting to acquit the mobster. Later the juror was murdered to make sure he never talked. You're never really sure if McCoy is doing this entirely because he is convinced of the attorney's guilt and complicity, or if it is the result of years of sour grapes because the defense attorney has known McCoy since law school and has always been besting him in and out of court. For that matter, we're not sure McCoy is sure of his own motives either, as he appears to have mixed emotions when he actually wins a conviction against his old schoolmate.The last episode ""Pride"" sees the exit of the last original member of the L&O; cast (I'm counting the DA from the pilot, Alfred Wentworth). The episode itself is not that memorable except for the fact that at the very end Logan punches a defendant who has just been freed thanks to a deadlocked jury and a controversial topic that was part of his defense. This whole thing with Logan finally resorting to violence seemed a bit contrived. After all, Logan had verbally sparred with suspects before, and taken other cases much more personally than this one, but this is the first time he reacts this way. It results in his demotion and being sent to walk a beat in Staten Island, which is the subject of a later L&O; movie, ""Exiled"". It's been said that the producers of the show decided to get rid of Logan because he was too much like Lenny, but to me this is what made their partnership click so well.At any rate, this is one of the best all-time seasons of L&O;, and I highly recommend it.",5,There's a new prosecutor in town,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,4911,"['season', 'first', 'season', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'playing',

1044438,A2S8FVEON6C199,B000MCH5AO,J. Westgate,"[2, 6]","This review is more about the DVD packaging and presentation than the show itself (although this is one of the best years of Law & Order).I love this show.  So naturally, I have purchased every one of the DVD sets for all 4 shows (L&O;, SVU, Criminal Intent, Trial by Jury).  My main complaint throughtout all of the releases is Universal's poor presentation of the show:1.  Double Sided Discs2.  2.0 Sound3.  Full Screen (square) aspect ratio.Now, along the way, they have corrected the double sided disc issue and are now releasing sets on 5 single sided discs.  Another nice item was that Law & Order:  Trial by Jury (complete series) was released in Dolby Digital 5.1 sound (although that is the ONLY set that has done so).But my biggest complaint (until now) is the FULL SCREEN aspect ratio.  Law & Order has been broadcasting in Widescreen High Definition for years, so obviously it was originally filmed in widescreen.  However, when it came to releasing the DVD's, it would be full screen!Those of you with Widescreen HDTV's and 5.1 surround systems know why I'm complaining.  We want the best possible presentation of our favorite shows!All you need to do is take a look at CSI, LOST, THE OFFICE, and other shows that put out their DVD season sets in Widescreen and 5.1 sound to see (and hear) the difference!But now, it apprears that Universal and the L&O; franchise are taking a step in the right direction.  Keep up the good work!Get used to it, everyone - widescreen is the wave of the future.  The sooner everything is in widescreen, the better.  So I hope the studios are listening:  release EVERYTHING (when possible) in WIDESCREEN.This set of Law & Order, Season 5 this that much better because it's in widescreen!",5,It's in WIDESCREEN!!!,1175731200,"04 5, 2007",2007,1731,"['review', 'more', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'presentation', 'show', 'one', 'best', 'years', 'Law', 'Order', '.I', 'love', 'show', 'So', 'naturally', 'have', 'purchased', 'one', 'DVD', 'sets', '4', 'shows', 'L', 'O', 'SVU', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'Trial', 'Jury', 'main', 'complaint', 'releases', 'Universal', 'poor', 'presentation', 'show:1', 'Double', 'Sided', 'Discs2', '2.0', 'Sound3', 'Full', 'Screen', 'square', 'aspect', 'ratio.Now', 'way', 'have', 'corrected', 'double', 'sided', 'disc', 'issue', 'are', 'now', 'releasing', 'sets', '5', 'single', 'sided', 'discs', 'nice', 'item', 'was', 'Law', 'Order', 'Trial', 'Jury', 'complete', 'series', 'was', 'released', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'sound', 'ONLY', 'set', 'done', 'so', '.But', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'now', 'FULL', 'SCREEN', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Law', 'Order', 'been', 'broadcasting', 'Widescreen', 'High', 'Definition', 'years', 'so', 'obviously', 'was', 'originally', 'filmed', 'widescreen', 'However', 'when', 'came', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'full', 'screen', 'Widescreen', 'HDTV', '5.1', 'surround', 'systems', 'know', 'why', ""'m"", 'complaining', 'want', 'best', 'possible', 'presentation', 'favorite', 'shows', 'need', 'do', 'take', 'look', 'CSI', 'LOST', 'THE', 'OFFICE', 'other', 'shows', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'season', 'sets', 'Widescreen', '5.1', 'sound', 'see', 'hear', 'difference', 'now', 'Universal', 'L', 'O', 'franchise', 'are', 'taking', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'Keep', 'good', 'work', 'Get', 'used', 'everyone', 'widescreen', 'wave', 'future', 'sooner', 'everything', 'widescreen', 'better', 'hope', 'studios', 'are', 'listening', 'release', 'EVERYTHING', 'when', 'possible', 'WIDESCREEN.This', 'set', 'Law', 'Order', 'Season', '5', 'much', 'better', 'widescreen']",N/A

1044443,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000MCH5AO,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[58, 60]","The fifth season of Law & Order marked another milestone for the long running series.  With original assistant DA Ben Stone (Michael Moriarty) gone, veteran actor Sam Waterston entered the scene as Jack McCoy; the longest serving cast member after S. Epatha Merkerson and the late, great Jerry Orbach, and he's still on the series to this day.  The fifth season also marked the final year for original cast member Chris Noth as Detective Mike Logan, who seals his fate in the season finale.  Despite the revolving door cast, Law & Order still managed to provide some powerhouse acting and great chemistry from the main cast of the show.  The interplay between detectives Briscoe (Orbach) and Logan (Noth) is by far the best the series has ever provided, and the chemistry between McCoy (Waterston) and fellow assistant DA Claire Kincaid (Jill Hennesey) was very well done to boot.  S. Epatha Merkerson is great as well as Lieutenant Van Buren, and Steven Hill is, well, Steven Hill.  This fifth season also provided even more ""ripped from the headlines"" storylines, including one eerily resembling the John Gotti case, and they are done excellently as well.  Sadly though, while this is the last superb cast lineup, this is also one of the real last excellent seasons to come from the series, as the revolving door of cast members and staff writers would continue to turn.

1044444,AGB7UQZMVHNUJ,B000MCH5AO,"NewDiane ""I live to read!""","[0, 0]","Chris Noth, who played Det. Mike Logan from the very first episode, bows out at the end of the fifth season of this venerable classic. It isn't until years later that he reappears in the spin-off Law & Order: Criminal Intent. So there was a special poignancy to watching the fifth season. The reliably excellent casting, writing, directing and acting are as good as ever. The film seems a bit grainier, perhaps in a deliberate return to the first couple of years. Nice twisty plots keep the viewer hanging and last-minute legal tricks surprise and sometimes bewilder. I particularly liked a couple of episodes where Sam Waterston's ADA McCoy pulls a creative legal rabbit out of his hat to turn his case around. In one, where a judge excludes things that would prove a woman killed her husband, McCoy tries to ""prove"" she loved him so that he can bring a rebuttal witness - a man she hired to kill him. In another, where there is a plea of self-defense, McCoy turns the tables with the defense's own witness. The stories cover politics, religion, sexuality, psychology, race...often as a riff on current events. However, some of those ""ripped from the headlines"" plots may not be as familiar to current viewers, as Season 5 took place in 1994.
