1091063,A1248JRIINWRTH,B000TJBNGC,"Angela Wilson ""I love books & DVDs!""","[4, 5]","A little camp, some good magick and a few unexpected twists make this an occult flick to watch.Sarah and her twin sister, Lindsey, are headed to college, where their mother has arranged for them to pledge at a snooty, Stepford-like sorority. Both want a fresh start. Sarah's uncontrollable supernatural abilities have made life difficult for the teens, and Sarah's fear of them makes her incredibly vulnerable - though you couldn't tell it from her attitude.Lindsey is the wannabe. She wants to fit in, to pledge and be accepted in a way she's never been before. Sarah is the rogue, dressing a little grungy (but cute) and not so much into ""fitting in."" They are both sought after by the two oldest Greek organizations on campus. One is their mother's choice, the other is a dark, spooky group known as the Pigs.Based on a TV movie of the same name, The Initiation of Sarah offers up some cool coven shots and interesting twists. Some of the twists you'll spot right off, but others aren't quite so obvious - depending on how many cult movies you watch. The scenes in the coven's fiery basement digs reminded me of The Mummy. And Morgan Fairchild looked SO good, her skin a little shiny, it made me wonder just how much plastic surgery she's had over the years. (Her hands give away her age.) Girl comment: LUV'd Jennifer Tilly's wardrobe.I was thankful that a movie appealing to teens did not have a bunch of nudity, slutty costumes, or sex to drive the plot. It would have totally ruined it. (Anyone remember the remake of Night of the Living Dead?) It was way fun to watch Stepford girls go up against the ""normally-dressed"" ones. The funny thing is that Lindsey and Sarah look nothing alike - and no one says anything to them. When you think twins, you think identical, but these girls are anything but. Just thought it was weird they didn't even make a mention that they were fraternal. (Is that the right word?)The DVD does not offer up a lot of extras, but does allow you subtitles in English or Spanish.Initiation of Sarah is a rent for a cold night, curled up on the couch with a quilt, popcorn and lots of chocolate.",5,Clean teen cult flick,1316649600,"09 22, 2011",2011,2126,"['little', 'camp', 'good', 'magick', 'few', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'make', 'occult', 'flick', 'watch.Sarah', 'twin', 'sister', 'Lindsey', 'are', 'headed', 'college', 'where', 'mother', 'arranged', 'pledge', 'snooty', 'Stepford-like', 'sorority', 'want', 'fresh', 'start', 'Sarah', 'uncontrollable', 'supernatural', 'abilities', 'have', 'made', 'life', 'difficult', 'teens', 'Sarah', 'fear', 'incredibly', 'vulnerable', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'attitude.Lindsey', 'wannabe', 'fit', 'pledge', 'be', 'accepted', 'way', 'never', 'been', 'before', 'Sarah', 'rogue', 'dressing', 'little', 'grungy', 'cute', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'fitting', 'are', 'sought', 'two', 'oldest', 'Greek', 'organizations', 'campus', 'One', 'mother', 'choice', 'other', 'dark', 'spooky', 'group', 'known', 'Pigs.Based', 'TV', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'Initiation', 'Sarah', 'up', 'cool', 'coven', 'shots', 'interesting', 'twists', 'twists', ""'ll"", 'spot', 'right', 'off', 'others', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'obvious', 'depending', 'how', 'many', 'cult', 'movies', 'watch', 'scenes', 'coven', 'fiery', 'basement', 'digs', 'reminded', 'Mummy', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'looked', 'SO', 'good', 'skin', 'little', 'shiny', 'made', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'had', 'years', 'hands', 'give', 'away', 'age', 'Girl', 'comment', 'LUV', ""'d"", 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'wardrobe.I', 'was', 'thankful', 'movie', 'appealing', 'teens', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'bunch', 'nudity', 'slutty', 'costumes', 'sex', 'drive', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'totally', 'ruined', 'Anyone', 'remember', 'remake', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'was', 'way', 'fun', 'watch', 'Stepford', 'girls', 'go', 'up', 'normally-dressed', 'ones', 'funny', 'thing', 'Lindsey', 'Sarah', 'look', 'nothing', 'alike', 'one', 'anything', 'When', 'think', 'twins', 'think', 'identical', 'girls', 'are', 'anything', 'Just', 'thought', 'was', 'weird', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'mention', 'were', 'fraternal', 'right', 'word', 'DVD', 'not', 'offer', 'up', 'lot', 'extras', 'allow', 'subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish.Initiation', 'Sarah', 'rent', 'cold', 'night', 'curled', 'up', 'couch', 'quilt', 'popcorn', 'lots', 'chocolate']",The Initiation of Sarah
