1156789,AEL6AD2AL2UX8,B0017CW5QM,"Kevin ""Revolution""","[1, 1]","For one low price you get two feel good romantic comedy's.  ""Frankie & Johnny"" stars Michelle Pfeiffer and Al Pacino.  The movie is one of my favorites and is about a down and out waitress who is courted persistently by a love struck cook.  It's funny, warm and moving all at the same time.  It's set in New York City with a wonderful array of colorful characters that work at a diner.  Michelle Pfeiffer had once said that this was one of her favorite roles and probably the one that is closest to her personally.  This would be hard to believe considering Michelle is one cinema's great beauties and she does her best to dress as down and be as melancholy as possible in this movie.""The Butcher's Wife"" is a great addition to this double feature.  It's lighter fare than ""Frankie & Johnny"" which is a more realistic romance of the two films.  Still, ""The Butcher's Wife"" has enough magic in it to satisfy even the coldest heart.  Demi Moore plays a clairvoyant who sees a Butcher washed ashore on her beach.  She follows him to New York city and marries him.  She enchants everyone in the town, but her husband starts questioning her motives as well as the local level headed psychiatrist.**At the posting of this review, this is the only way to get ""The Butcher's Wife"" at a reasonable price.  Buying the movie solo you'll find it being sold at outrageous prices as the actual movie DVD release seems to have been pulled off the market.  The studio has no information at this time if it will be re-released.**",5,Michelle Pfeiffer & Demi Moore: Two titans in one double feature,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,1512,"['one', 'low', 'price', 'get', 'two', 'feel', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Frankie', 'Johnny', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'movie', 'one', 'favorites', 'down', 'waitress', 'who', 'courted', 'persistently', 'love', 'struck', 'cook', 'funny', 'warm', 'moving', 'same', 'time', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'wonderful', 'array', 'colorful', 'characters', 'work', 'diner', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'had', 'once', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'roles', 'probably', 'one', 'closest', 'personally', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'believe', 'considering', 'Michelle', 'one', 'cinema', 'great', 'beauties', 'best', 'dress', 'down', 'be', 'as', 'melancholy', 'possible', 'movie', 'Butcher', 'Wife', 'great', 'addition', 'double', 'feature', 'lighter', 'fare', 'Frankie', 'Johnny', 'more', 'realistic', 'romance', 'two', 'films', 'Still', 'Butcher', 'Wife', 'enough', 'magic', 'satisfy', 'even', 'coldest', 'heart', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'clairvoyant', 'who', 'Butcher', 'washed', 'ashore', 'beach', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'marries', 'everyone', 'town', 'husband', 'questioning', 'motives', 'as', 'well', 'local', 'level', 'headed', 'psychiatrist', '**At', 'posting', 'review', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'Butcher', 'Wife', 'reasonable', 'price', 'Buying', 'movie', 'solo', ""'ll"", 'find', 'being', 'sold', 'outrageous', 'prices', 'actual', 'movie', 'DVD', 'release', 'have', 'been', 'pulled', 'off', 'market', 'studio', 'information', 'time', 'will', 'be', 're-released', '**']",The Butcher's Wife / Frankie and Johnny Double Feature

As a therapist he is way in over his head and should retire. As far as the movie goes, Demi is at her best in a softer way, the cast is good and the story just a feel good movie.
