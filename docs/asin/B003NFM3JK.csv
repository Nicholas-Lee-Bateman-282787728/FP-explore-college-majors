Therefore it teaches children to fear the unknown and slaves them to live in fear and hence weakens their full potential in life.The story is best suited for medieval times, when people believe in ghosts and witchery. If I should rated this movie for the special effects it would probably get a 4.5 to 5 stars. But the content in it self brings depression to people who still believes in hell and feels far short from the natural love of God. I will suggest to any one that is suffering from depression or any similar situation to avoid this movie at all cost, even if the outcome is somehow positive at the end. Shame on Disney that continues to scare young children, with a nonsense, never ending of evil versus good. Of course there are always those who love a good terror movie or a book that immerses them into a hell of fear.

1354925,A19K5DILM15WU3,B003NFM3JK,Alex,"[3, 4]","I went to the midnight show of Disney's 'A Christmas Carol' last night and going into it, I was really excited. I was lucky enough to see the train tour that went around the country to promote the film and even got to see director Robert Zemeckis talk about the film at the D23 Expo. I'm a big fan of the Charles Dickens story as well, of course my two favorite film versions star Kermit the Frog and Mickey Mouse.Disney's new motion capture film is wonderful! I absolutely loved it, and I'm usually not a fan of motion capture. Jim Carrey is fabulous as Scrooge and the three ghosts. This adaptation is more faithful to the Charles Dickens classic than any other film version. In fact, it even begins with the opening of the book. And I found the 3D to be more impressive than Disney's previous 3D releases. In this film, items appear to pop off the screen and into the theater.Overall, I loved this new version and will definitely see it again in theaters. However, I must warn anybody with small children that this film is scary. In fact, it made me jump twice. I have to say that my favorite film version is still 'The Muppet Christmas Carol,' mainly because it's fun and has a lighter tone, but this new version is very good.

1354931,A15LV8T2XAUD0Y,B003NFM3JK,Amazon Customer,"[4, 6]","This film has been completely rendered in CGI.  As such it has some advantages over, and yet alternatively suffers when compared to, the best live action dramas.  In addition, this production cannot seem to decide whether it is to be a dark yet faithful adaptation of Dickens' work, or a pratfall-strewn, cartoon comedy.  With feet in both camps, it ends up unsuccessful in each.  There can be no question that CGI can offer a lot to enhance such a costume drama.  Every inanimate object was rendered faithfully and sometimes astonishingly.  The city of London in the 19th century was wonderfully presented.  The filming of Spirits and other spectral events can be greatly enhanced by CGI effects.  But ultimately it is the characters that sell the story.  The animated people in this production looked waxy and unrealistic.  Facial expressions lacked the sublime subtlety of reality.  Eyes were glassy and expressionless resembling audio-animatronic figures more than real human beings.  Things were not helped by the screenwriters' inability to come to grips with how they wanted to tell the story.  The pratfalls and comic chases clashed alarmingly with the dark and creepy aspects of the rest of the story.  Much of the film was a straight telling of Dickens' tale and was obviously well-researched as many details provided in the novella were accurately rendered.  Yet in its schizophrenia, the film also chooses at times to dispense with any effort at accuracy or even verisimilitude by inserting ridiculous scenes of cartoon-like quality.  If one wants a satisfying cartoon version of the Dickens tale, both amusing and touching, one need only view Disney's ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"".  In short, while at times quite accurate, its deficiencies make it difficult to recommend this film as the most accurate filmic representation of Dickens.

1354934,A2UUS5CMDXZN8B,B003NFM3JK,"Amazon Customer ""veilance""","[7, 10]","As an English teacher who's taught the novel for over ten years, I'm very familiar with the story Dickens crafted.  He is a master of the English language, and of story telling.  While Disney studios know how to do animation, they and Robert Zemeckis fell short on this adaptation.ORIGINAL STORY: It is important to know that when Dickens wrote his novel, few people celebrated Christmas; in fact, the holiday was more or less ignored by most of the world.  The Industrial Revolution was in full swing in England, and a large portion of the population was extremely poor.  Those that weren't tended to be business owners, who were rather selfish and greedy, and treated their workers poorly.  Dickens' intent in writing the story was to use this well-known but little-celebrated holiday as a touch-point for his Unitarian beliefs (which basically suggested that all people should unite [thus, ""Unitarians""] to help each other and make the world a better place) and get the rich to help the poor, and the poor to help each other, so that all people could live happier lives. As an allegory, the novel features Scrooge, who symbolically represents the repressive and greedy business owners of the time, ill-treating his clerk Bob, symbolically representative of the thoughtful and kind but poor working class. The story is presented in five chapters (called ""staves, the plural of the musical term ""staff"", since this is a Christmas ""carol""), each of which has a specific function.  The first introduces the main character, Ebenezer Scrooge, describing his miserliness and presenting him with a supernatural visitation from his former partner, now a tormented ghost who sees that Scrooge will have the same torments when he dies if Scrooge does not change his ways.  The second stave deals with Scrooge's past, and how he became the horrible person he is.  The third stave details Dickens' ideas of a perfect Christmas, and how even the poorest of the poor can find happiness in the day.  The fourth stave deals with Scrooge's potential future if he does not change his ways.  The final stave explains how all of this has affected Scrooge.MOVIE ADAPTATION: When it comes to the movie adaptation, the whole affair begins rather well with an adaptation of the first few pages of the novel; the interpretation is interesting, and generally captures the concept Dickens was going for.  Zemeckis made the choice to not have a narrator for the story (until the very last scene), which is curious, since the story specifically has a narrator that interacts with the audience and help clarify certain portions of the book.  This would have been a useful addition, especially for some scenes that are relatively faithful to the language of 1840's England that will undoubtedly leave modern audiences, and especially the young, confused.I was very pleased at the accuracy of the dialogue and general action of the first few scenes after the introduction, but grew worried during the famous scene with Marley's face appearing on Scrooge's door knocker.  Zemeckis added an overly-dramatic twist to the scene which didn't add anything to the story and which sets up an expectation that the story will be much scarier and action-filled than it actually is.Jacob Marley's arrival as a ghost was rather well-done, and captured the spirit of the scene (pardon the pun), if not hewing to the actual word.  This is when I grew more curious - Zemeckis had initially followed the book rather faithfully up until this point (barring the introduction), and this scene turned out to be the beginning of every-greater swings away from the actual story as written by Dickens, both in the letter and in essence.Completely neglecting the fact that Scrooge falls asleep and sleeps through an entire day, things started to get ever-farther away from the original text with the arrival of the Spirit of Christmas Past.  A few scenes are neglected that help the audience truly get a sense of how Scrooge came by his dislike of the holiday, and which show how he actually did enjoy some of his Christmases.  One of the most important scenes that didn't make it into the movie is Scrooge's completely unselfconscious discussion with the Spirit about how his old boss, Fezziwig, made people happy without having to spend much money, and how happiness is, in fact, more important than money; this leads Scrooge to speculate that he could make his own employee much happier very easily.  This is a seminal moment in the story, in that it plants the first of many seeds in Scrooge's mind about how he should behave, and helps Scrooge begin to re-connect with humanity.  Still, the story is generally (if not specifically) faithful to the original, and provides a basic understanding of how Scrooge became the man he is.It is with the next scene that the wheels really start to come off the train.  Again, the perceived passage of time is ignored (which makes Scrooge's amazement about how it's Christmas Day at the end of the movie completely irrelevant).  Zemeckis makes some very unusual choices in staging the scenes with the Spirit of Christmas Present.  First and foremost is the (rather literal) framing device used as the Spirit begins to show Scrooge the wonders of Christmas Day - it is distracting from the action, and completely unnecessary.  It was in this section of the story that Zemeckis and Disney seem to decide that they know more about how to structure a story than one of the greatest writers of all time.  Major sections of the third chapter of the novel are completely left out, and this is a shame.  Dickens did not include these scenes lightly - they serve the important narrative purpose of pointing out to the audience what a perfect Christmas is supposed to be like (and, indeed, on which many of our modern celebrations of the holidays are founded), and providing Scrooge with insight into the lives of people he has treated poorly.  These scenes are, at best, truncated, and most are simply left out.  The final scene in this section of the story is wildly over-the-top, and though it does do a decent job of summarizing some of the symbolism in a narrative fashion, it is extremely grim and dark, much more so than Dickens probably intended.The visit of the final spirit, of Christmas Yet to Come, is completely ridiculous and bears little resemblance to what is related in the novel.  There is a five minute chase scene that has absolutely nothing to do with the story, and is not very entertaining to watch even on its own.The concluding part of the story goes back to being rather faithful to the source material.Overall, the story is very disjointed, and does not capture the original very well past the first quarter of the movie.  As my wife said, ""It's as if they split the story into pieces and had five different people work on each piece in isolation, then slapped all the sections together at the end.""",2,"Disney tries to

It is a little surprising that the first big budget animated version of this story is also the scariest version ever filmed.

I love the whole film but the part with the ghost of Christmas past is pure magic.

Wilson ""Christmas Lover""","[5, 5]","I have never written a review after having been an Amazon customer for over 8 years now at least, however, after seeing the dreadful amount of reviews for the movie, I had to make sure I gave it a 5 star review.  I consider myself a ""Christmas Carol"" movie buff (of my own making of course), and this version is so close to perfect that it deserves the highest of all reviews.  For those who say that this was meant to be an uplifting story and is too 'scary', I suppose you have never taken the time to read the book.  It is a story of redemption, and of turning a miserable miser into a completely uplifted new man.  A man that was given a second chance at life...and I am sorry, but it would have sickened me to see them portray this otherwise.  In order for man to change, they must see their wrongs and the repercussions that will happen if life is continued being lived without care of others, and this is exactly what Dicken's was portraying, and what the movie came across as. To see it all 'fluffed' up and 'Disney'd' up would just be ridiculing what Dicken's was trying to prove.  I personally love the version with George C. Scott, as well as the classic with Alastair Sim, but when I saw this first last year, I knew that there was a new classic.  All the parts, minor as they may be, that have been left out of previous versions were included, and I thought that this movie hit the book to the 't' and am so glad to have this movie to pass down to others, to show what the book was truly supposed to be like when coming to life in Hollywood.  For those who feel it is too scary, I suggest you show your children Sesame Street or something of the like, because I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but guess what?  Life is not always good, sometimes it can be downright harsh....and this movie put to life what happens when a man who has been a terrible person both inside his heart and out gets a chance at redemption...a second chance to live, and if this is not something your children may understand at their young age, then you may want to just put this on the shelf for a few more years until they realize that life is not full of marshmallows and happiness 24 hours a day....otherwise, sit down and enjoy the movie of a lifetime!",5,Needed to raise the star level!,1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,2248,"['have', 'never', 'written', 'review', 'having', 'been', 'Amazon', 'customer', '8', 'years', 'now', 'least', 'however', 'seeing', 'dreadful', 'amount', 'reviews', 'movie', 'had', 'make', 'sure', 'gave', '5', 'star', 'review', 'consider', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'movie', 'buff', 'own', 'making', 'course', 'version', 'so', 'close', 'perfect', 'highest', 'reviews', 'who', 'say', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'uplifting', 'story', 'too', ""'scary"", 'suppose', 'have', 'never', 'taken', 'time', 'read', 'book', 'story', 'redemption', 'turning', 'miserable', 'miser', 'completely', 'uplifted', 'new', 'man', 'man', 'was', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'life', 'am', 'sorry', 'would', 'have', 'sickened', 'see', 'portray', 'otherwise', 'order', 'man', 'change', 'must', 'see', 'wrongs', 'repercussions', 'will', 'happen', 'life', 'continued', 'being', 'lived', 'care', 'others', 'exactly', 'what', 'Dicken', 'was', 'portraying', 'what', 'movie', 'came', 'see', ""'fluffed"", 'up', ""'Disney"", ""'d"", 'up', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'ridiculing', 'what', 'Dicken', 'was', 'trying', 'prove', 'personally', 'love', 'version', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'as', 'well', 'classic', 'Alastair', 'Sim', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'last', 'year', 'knew', 'was', 'new', 'classic', 'parts', 'minor', 'may', 'be', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'previous', 'versions', 'were', 'included', 'thought', 'movie', 'hit', 'book', ""'t"", 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'have', 'movie', 'pass', 'down', 'others', 'show', 'what', 'book', 'was', 'truly', 'supposed', 'be', 'when', 'coming', 'life', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'feel', 'too', 'scary', 'suggest', 'show', 'children', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'something', 'like', 'hate', 'be', 'bearer', 'bad', 'news', 'guess', 'what', 'Life', 'not', 'always', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'downright', 'harsh', '.and', 'movie', 'put', 'life', 'what', 'when', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'terrible', 'person', 'heart', 'chance', 'redemption', 'second', 'chance', 'live', 'not', 'something', 'children', 'may', 'understand', 'young', 'age', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'just', 'put', 'shelf', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'realize', 'life', 'not', 'full', 'marshmallows', 'happiness', '24', 'hours', 'day', '.otherwise', 'sit', 'down', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'lifetime']",Disney's A Christmas Carol

Unfortunately, this movie doesn't take advantage of their star. As a matter of fact, practically anyone could have played the roles he was given with the same excitement.The effects here are amazing, and the computer animation is wonderful. Their treatment of Marley's Ghost is by far the best of any Christmas Carol movie I've seen. It's actually scary, which is good. However, Jim's performance as Scrooge and the ghosts seems basically phoned in. He's playing the characters pretty much standard as any other version of the film. His interpretation of the Ghost of Christmas Past is actually the weakest I've seen (their decision for his overall design was strange anyway). This is one time they probably would have come off better to just let him play Scrooge and give the ghosts to someone else. Gary Oldham does a great job as Cratchit and Marley, actually stealing the show from Carrey's generic Scrooge.Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting Scrooge to play like Ace Ventura or anything, but it would have been nice to see a little spark of fun in there somewhere. It seemed to me that Carrey was actually bored with the roles (since this was motion captured from him).Still, it's nice to see ""A Christmas Carol"" on screen again.

1354966,A1PCESNDC808ZM,B003NFM3JK,Charles Griffin,"[3, 4]","Okay, so motion capture animation has gotten a little better, but more on that later!I've reviewed a few versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" here on Amazon and finally got around to watching this one. Everybody knows the story about Scrooge by now, and I'm too lazy to go over the synopsis, but I will say much of this adaption is beautifully made and it's fairly faithful to Dickens...fairly.I suppose we've come to expect cinematic adaptations to be a bit over the top. So when Disney and Jim Carrey decided to come out with their own interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge, we had to know there would be physical comedy, chase scenes and overt sentimentality. It certainly wouldn't have the subtlety of Masterpiece Theater (although wouldn't you love to see their take on the story starring someone like, say, Ian McKellen as Scrooge?) Anyway, over the top is certainly what we got. And I don't mind seeing Scrooge flying over London from the second story of his house, or being chased through the streets by a ghostly horse-drawn carriage, or even needlessly shrinking down to the size of a mouse. The problem is there's SO MUCH of this kind of junk involved, it truncates the spirit of the story. If you were to strip away all the goofy additional material, you would realize you're watching nothing but cliffnotes in motion capture. For example, it just seemed odd that Scrooge would get emotional about Tiny Tim's plight considering he barely had time to connect with the lad.As far as the horse-drawn carriage chase and the Scrooge-shrinkage, the problem is they go on WAY too long! And it seems to me, the purpose of Scrooge witnessing some of these events in the future are defeated while he's preoccupied fleeing from the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come through London streets or avoiding blows from a poker wielded by Old Joe! You'll see what I mean, when you watch the movie.Jim Carrey actually does a pretty good job as Scrooge. I just don't understand why him. It seems like any number of fine British actors could have voiced the role, or motion captured the role, or whatever the heck you want to call it. He's not particularly impressive as the Ghost of Christmas Present, however, who's maniacal laughing only annoys after a while. Speaking of the Ghost of Christmas Present, what a horrible way to depict his demise. Nothing expresses ""Merry Christmas"" like watching a jolly bearded ghost waste away to bone and ash! Speaking of macabre imagery, I know they meant to be funny when Jacob Marley's jaw cracks open, but double-u-tee-eff? I'm starting to think they missed the boat not having Scrooge resemble Vincent Price! It all would have made sense then! Oh, and I have no idea what was going on with Marley's eyes.All the other voices were fine, except Colin Firth. An actor I normally love, he seemed to over exaggerate his vocal performance...like he was all too aware he was in an animated feature.Now about this whole motion capture business. I know they've made some advances in the technology. And it's true the job done on Scrooge himself is the best we've seen so far. But as impressive has his character looks, everyone else still looked (as Dickens described Jacob Marley) dead as a doornail! They just haven't mastered the eyes of the characters and can't shake the creep factor. Perhaps there's something to be said for traditional animation that Robert Zemeckis hasn't figured out. Animated characters should LOOK like animated characters...exaggerated features and all. The more animation strives for reality, the more perfect they need to be in capturing the details, especially the eyes, which are called the ""windows of the soul"" for a reason.These Zemeckis characters are still soulless creatures unable to depict the subtle emotions of Bugs Bunny, let alone a flesh and blood actor!I wouldn't say this is the worst adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"" I've ever seen as it is handsomely made and highly energetic.

1354971,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003NFM3JK,Chris Pandolfi,"[15, 17]","The story of ""A Christmas Carol"" and its themes haven't been fresh in people's minds for well over 100 years, which is why the new film adaptation by Robert Zemeckis is so surprising. This is, from my perspective, the definitive version - a sumptuous visual feast that in no way compromises the drama, excitement, and hope of the Charles Dickens classic. Its greatest achievement is not reducing itself to the level of jolly Christmas clich&eacute;s. The streets and buildings of nineteenth-century London are brightly coated with snow, yet they betray the cold reality of poverty and despair. And Ebenezer Scrooge, having been played by many, many actors over the years, finally looks like the ancient, decrepit, bitter man I always imagined him to be; his face doesn't show the slightest trace of warmth, humor, or charm.The film's success can be attributed to Zemeckis' love affair with special effects, which in this case involves the same motion capture technology he employed in ""The Polar Express"" and ""Beowulf."" This allows for the creation of characters caught in that delightful gray zone between real and unreal. Some are more exaggerated than others; Scrooge - a little too tall, a little too thin, a little too hunched over - is a menacing physical representation of his own anger and resentment. The Ghost of Christmas Past, an elfin wraith with a breathy voice and a head made of fire, is as slight, slender, and soft-spoken as a candle. The Ghost of Christmas Present is a loud and jovial Father Christmas figure, whose laugh is just as big as his body, perhaps bigger. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is a silent yet frightening skeletal phantom made out of shadows.Scrooge and the Ghosts are all played by Jim Carrey, which hardly comes as a shock since he has an affinity for variety of character and over the top performances. Other actors include Gary Oldman as Bob Crachit, Tiny Tim, and Jacob Marley, whose postmortem appearance in Scrooge's bedchamber is intensely creepy, just as it should be. Robin Wright Penn plays both Scrooge's younger sister, Fen, and his neglected fianc&eacute;e, Belle. Bob Hoskins plays old Fezziwig, a man so thoroughly in the Christmas spirit that he and his wife defy gravity as they dance. Colin Firth plays Scrooge's hopelessly optimistic nephew Fred, quite possibly the only person who thinks his uncle is worth addressing in a friendly manner.As Scrooge is taken on his journey of redemption, both he and the audience are treated to fantastic aerial tours of London, with shots that swoop and soar over rooftops, through windows, and around street corners. 3-D technology, normally so unimpressive, is here perfectly utilized, allowing for one of the most immersive environments of any recent animated film. One of the most stunning sequences involves a spectral carriage chasing a shrunken Scrooge up and down dark, snowy cobblestone streets; it's not only an astounding visual achievement, it's also an exhilarating thrill ride. Harkening back to the roller coaster train sequences created for ""The Polar Express,"" Zemeckis proves that you should stick with what works best.There are also some equally effective quiet moments, such as the opening shot, which pays homage to classic Disney animated films with the opening of a book. Other moments are surprisingly powerful, as when a grieving Bob Cratchit, his eyes red with tears, seems to be staring directly at Scrooge even though he can't really see him (Cratchit, in that moment, is nothing more than a vision of the future). I also appreciated the shot of doomed ghosts floating just outside Scrooge's window; some of them act humorously, banging their heads against their chain boxes, and yet we can't help but feel sorry for them.The entire film embodies a darker, shivery tone - not to the point of becoming a computer-animated horror film, but certainly beyond the colorful whimsy of the average Christmas special. This, I believe, truly captures the tone of Dickens' original story, which doesn't spare the reader the hardships of destitution, disease, and loss. Consider Bob Cratchit's family; they do make merry of themselves on Christmas Day, but they also live a meager existence, and there's always the sense that, should nothing about their situation change, they could end up with even less.Robert Zemeckis created a perennial holiday classic with ""The Polar Express,"" and I think he may have done it again with ""A Christmas Carol."" Yes, we have seen this movie before, and yes, its message is far from original. But there's no denying the fact that it's sending a good message, where love, compassion, and the possibility of hope reign supreme. There's also no denying that, with visuals this striking, it practically begs to be seen, especially in 3-D. This is one of the year's best looking animated films, so richly detailed, so sharply defined, so gloriously shot. It creates a mood, effectively evoking feelings of warmth and tenderness without becoming sappy or mindlessly cheerful. That above all made seeing this film an absolutely beautiful experience, one that I recommend to everybody.",5,A New Look for a Classic Story,1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,5127,"['story', 'A',

He changed the face of animation forever with his classic Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Years later he dazzled all of us with The Polar Express and his legendary adaptation of Beowulf. Now, he's done it once more with his latest masterpiece from Walt Disney: A Christmas Carol.I don't know of any story that's been retold more than this one, and rightfully so. It's been around for nearly 200 years, and I'm sure Zemeckis's version won't be the last to be seen.I'll take the liberty of assuming that everyone is familiar with the plot, and just highlight the key points: Ebenezer Scrooge absolutely despises Christmas and everything to do with it. He has a massive fortune but not so much as a single friend, and treats everyone like rubbish. Seven years after the death of his partner Jacob Marley, he will be visited by the ghost of Marley as well as three other specters (the ghosts of the past, present and future) on the night of Christmas Eve. The ghosts will show him visions of his past, present and future and the life he has lived and will live, if he does not change his twisted ways.You get what you'd expect from the plot, yes, and you've seen it a hundred times in other forms, yes; but you have never seen it quite like this. Despite being a huge Robert Zemeckis fan and maybe even a bigger fan of Jim Carrey, I too had these same thoughts going in. But as I was, you too will be amazed.The animation is nothing short of incredible. Several times in the film, I thought I was looking at real people and actual sets, for a few seconds. It's truly impressive. This will no-doubt be a must-own on Blu-ray! The colors are vibrant, the picture is crystal clear and the sound quality is truly spectacular.You can see Jim Carrey and Colin Firth and Gary Oldman, hidden in the characters they voice, and it's awesome! I'm sure that the actors physically acted out these scenes at some point during the process in addition to the voice-over-work, as their physical movements are all very life-like.Jim Carrey plays Ebenezer Scrooge exceptionally well and we have never seen the character more hideous and vial. He is terrifyingly thin and oddly hunched over and looks like he's ready to croak any second. His voice is raspy and dry and it makes your skin crawl.If you are expecting to laugh during the film, DON'T. The laughs are scarce as this is a very heavy drama indeed. In addition to the drama, it's very dark as well, so you may want to re-think taking smaller children. The spirits are scary and there are several moments where things jump out at you and make loud unsettling noises.What makes this so different from other versions of the classic Dickens tale, aside from the obvious beautiful look the film offers, are the moments where Scrooge is visited by the ghosts.Robert Zemeckis wrote the script in addition to directing the film, so it is very much his spin on things. The three entities are all different from what we have seen in versions of the past and they offer a nice touch to the story, cinematically. They don't crowd the scenes they're in. They take Scrooge where he needs to go, and offer him minimal guidance and that is good for the kids; they will be able to learn the valuable lessons of this story, from seeing what's happening with the characters, versus the ghosts telling us and Scrooge the implications his actions have and will cause.We also go on spectacular thrill-ride adventures with Scrooge as he is hurled through the streets of London, and shot into the sky like a rocket.Zemeckis and his team of animators have created a gorgeous London for this story to unfold in.

Pretty much so.  With some of the politically correct garbage that Hollywood cranks out at Christmas (anybody remember Happy Feet?), it is hard to find a non-PC movie at Christmas.  This movie does not push any political agenda or radical fluff.Second, My family did not like it.  As for families, this movie is definitely NOT for small children.  It is too intense in many scenes.Third, I will watch a Christmas movie and then think as to whether I want in my collection of Christmas movies.  At first, I thought I would want this one.  Now that I have had time to think on it, deinitely not.  I won't bother renting it either.As for the movie, my subject line says it all.  I think there was too much concentration on the action scenes.  The Ghost of Christmas Future sequence went on WAY TOO LONG.  The message to A Christmas Carol gets lost in the concentration on the action.  Scrooge being a greedy and unfeeling tyrant is there at the beginning but not brought out as much as the story progresses.  The story of Cratchitt (spelling?) is rather lost.  The story of Belle and Scrooge's courtship seems 'glazed over'.  The reason why Scrooge is left at boarding school as a boy was not really explained.  There are sequences of the movie that are good.  The Ghost of Christmas Present was entertaining at times.  I have put in the Patrick Stewart version of A Christmas Carol (which I HIGHLY recommend) to do a quick comparison before writing this review.Lastly, there is something about a Christmas movie that I look for that this movie tries to deliver at the end but comes up short.  I like a Christmas movie that can give me goose bumps, a good / warm feeling or perhaps draws a tear.  The whole redemption sequence at the end does deliver some of this, but it is too little too late.Should you see this movie?  I would not recommend it.  It definitely won't be purchased for my DVD collection.  If you are thinking about seeing it (and don't have small children), I would normally recommend seeing it for yourself to judge.

The movie effectively captures all the essential elements of the story, including the presentations by the ghosts of past, present, and future.  If some scenes are a bit over the top, such as the exotic dancing at Old Fezziwig's, or Ebenezer's flying sequences, it's a bit of relief after Scrooge's unhappy confrontations with the ghosts.

To me, it seemed to drag quite a bit to where I was losing interest. (VERY unusual for me!)  The Ghost of Christmas Past was a bit weird, in looks and in speech. I'm not quite sure what effect they were going for here but it did not work for me.  And I'm still trying to figure out why Scrooge was shrunk down to rodent size wtth the Ghost of Christmas past. (Maybe I missed something while I was losing interest as it dragged.)I'm glad I didn't spend too much for the DVD.

The sheer joy of finally seeing Dicken's vision fully realized from beginning to end made it a film for the ages. Jim Carrey, who disappears in his various characters, especially Scrooge, is just brilliant in his voice and mannerisms. I am stunned by his overall performance. And the animation is gorgeous in every way.

There have been other films, stage productions, musicals, and family readings galore and it still holds the magic of what the spirit of Christmas is all about.  Doubtless there will be flocks of naysayers who don't buy into this adaptation by Robert Zemekis, but given the ghost story magic Dickens' created, this film takes it one step further and makes the ghostly three spirits very much alive and beautiful fanciful.Combining the actors with animation (animating the actors might be a better way of describing the magic) makes each of the many very well known actors who portray the characters that much more credible.  Jim Carrey is at his peak as an actor in his ability to become the illusions his mind creates: he portrays all three ghosts as well a Scrooge at every level of his history.  Other actors who are transformed by Zemekis and staff include Gary Oldman as the trio of Cratchit, Marley's Ghost, and Tiny Tim, Colin Firth as the jovial nephew, Cary Elwes, Robin Wright Penn, Bob Hoskins, Fionnula Flanagan and a host of others.  The costumes and scenery are brilliantly executed.One problem with the film that may require parental judgment is the fact that the ghosts are truly scary and children might not be able to get past the fear they instill.

Robert Zemeckis, Jim Carrey, Gary Oldman, et al. give us a movie of ""A Christmas Carol"" that, while animated, demands to be seen with the same sophistication and maturity level as its live-action counterparts.Actually, this reminds me of older Disney films, with the visual artistry of ""Banbi"" or ""Peter Pan.""  In more modern times, Japanese anime seems to be a stylistic influence on this picture.  Jim Carrey is positively brilliant as Ebenezzer Scrooge, in addition to every ghost outside of Jacob Marley.  It is truly astounding how Carrey makes the viewer forget his claim to fame as a comedian and marvel at his vocal work, as he effortlessly runs a very wide gamut that puts him in company with the animation vocal artist masters.Gary Oldman is also a standout vocally in three roles, as Bob Cratchit, Jacob Marley, and Tiny Tim.  As Marley, he is particularly impressive as a model of fierce repentance and conviction.If you're a parent of a young child, please try to take the time to screen this in advance of them seeing it.  It is not geared for children, and does not make storytelling concessions for them.

1355017,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B003NFM3JK,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[6, 6]","This animated adaptation of Charles Dickens', ""A Christmas Carol,"" could well become the classic film version to 21st century kids as the Alistair Sims ""Scrooge"" became in the 1950s.  The animation is so 19th century authentic that it actually is continually illustrating the Victorian classic book.  It is true to the Dickens words and spirit.  From the beginning it is a visual-experiencing of olde London.  All that is missing is the smell of coal smoke and horse dung.It is not just Jim Carrey (Scrooge, 3 ghosts, & more) and Gary Oldman (Cratchit, Marley, Tiny Tim) that so passionately do the unforgettable characters' voices. Colin Firth, a necessary for any top quality Victorian London story, as Ebenezer's nephew Fred's voice, is animated to look the most like himself.Animated sets are thrilling and punctuated with moments like sliding down hilly iced-over cobblestone back streets, the coal soot patina on 1840s shops, and animated London fog looking more atmospheric than the real thing. Scrooge's bony fingers are as true-to-life as on an emaciated elderly man near death. Scrooge is himself a bit ghostly; like a more aged Lemony Snicket. And about as darkly evil.____(Excuse the name dropping, but with any great film--it is bound to be compared to other accomplishments.) Like the aerial flight through time where Scrooge is hand-held by a ghost.  It recalls images of Mary Martin in ""Peter Pan.""The 2nd 'Scottish' Spirit's home was a Victorian Christmas visual masterpiece of delight; and the trip through Christmas Present, more like floating with ""Mary Poppins.""  Spirit of the Future's trip adventure, however, depicted more peril than anything ""Indiana Jones"" ever encountered. Action! Misadventure! Fear!This film is technically animated beyond ""Polar Express.""  Characters' hair, snow & ice, and the Cratchit Christmas goose are all as aesthetically fine and real as any photography.The only negative for this adaptation to Dickens' Christmas Spirits' story is the inability to push a ""play"" button on a remote for a second viewing. I can't wait for a DVD version (next year?). For now, it's back to the box office.IT'S A CLASSIC-both book and film.  Don't do this Christmas without seeing it.  It's perfect for our economic times: the underlying theme that Christmas is about giving and family.  Take your family (as long as the kids are beyond 2nd grade). Preschoolers and early-elementary age might be frightened.  Remember the Dickens story is a bit on the dark side till the end.Don't leave till after the credits.  The song sung by Andrea Bocelli, ""God Bless Us Everyone"", (writers: Alan Silvestri, Glen Ballard) is at the end.  It could/SHOULD be on this year's Top-10 Christmas Song list.

I saw this first in theaters, I was amazed at not only the story and digital effect, but the 3D. Disney's A Christmas Carol is by far has the best 3D effects I ever have seen. I wondered if the thrill would transfer to 2D. It did, although there is certain scenes that look a bit off obviously added just for the 3D effect. I was supprised at the bonus features. They were about all a fan of this film could expect or want they follow:Picture in Picture: by far the best special feature on the disc. It shows the actors as they filmed the movie, black dot's and all.Commentary:  This is meant to go along with the PIP, but it is optional. Zemeckis' commentary is a little borning but still worth the lisen.Countdown to Christmas:A frustrating advent calender.Capturing Dickens:  A short documenty(hosted by a VERY annoying woman) it's informative but a little too short.On set with Sammi: a featurette were one of the cast members tell us about motion captureDeleted Scenes: Deleted scenes obviously. They are good and a little fun to watchOverall I would say that the special features are rather good.

1355019,A28ILXH590CMRJ,B003NFM3JK,Hazen B Markoe,"[1, 1]","Ever since it was first published in 1843, Charles Dickens' tale of miserly Scrooge and his redemption at the hands of various ghosts has long entranced readers with its message of holiday cheer.  It has been adapted numerous times for both stage and screen with a wide variety of distinguished actors such as Alistair Sim and George C. Scott taking on the Scrooge role.  This time, director Robert Zemeckis takes on the familiar story with the help of 3-D motion capture animation and the rubber-limbed talents of Jim Carrey.  What emerges is a flick that, despite its tendency to overuse the 3-D tricks of the trade, is a very faithful adaptation of the Dickens' work in both mood and detail.  In an unusual twist, Carrey not only tackles the role of miserly Scrooge in all his incarnations, but also the roles of all three of the Christmas Spirits who haunt him.  To his credit, Carrey chooses to underplay the miser, making him more believable as a result. He's also very effective in his interpretations of Christmas Past and Yet to Come, with only Christmas Present displaying any hint of his usual penchant to overact.  Carrey is also given solid support by Gary Oldman as Marley's Ghost and Bob Cratchit, Bob Hoskins' Fezziwig and Old Joe, and Robin Wright Penn's Belle and Fan.  Colin Firth provides a nice contrast to Carrey in his role of Fred, Scrooge's nephew.Zemeckis presents a handsome production that faithfully recreates Victorian London, supported by a wonderful soundtrack by Alan Silvestri.  Zemeckis' screenplay also does justice to the tale by presenting many of the darker themes that tend to get ignored in many other adaptations.  Indeed, it should be noted that some of the images might be considered too strong for very young audiences.  Overall, this film proves to be a delightfully strong entry into the list of worthy CAROL adaptations and definitely worth seeing.",4,Disney presents a delightful version of Dickens' classic,1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,1896,"['Ever', 'was', 'first', 'published', '1843', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'tale', 'miserly', 'Scrooge', 'redemption', 'hands', 'various', 'ghosts', 'long', 'entranced', 'readers', 'message', 'holiday', 'cheer', 'been', 'adapted', 'numerous', 'times', 'stage', 'screen', 'wide', 'variety', 'distinguished', 'actors', 'such', 'Alistair', 'Sim', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'taking', 'Scrooge', 'role', 'time', 'director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'familiar', 'story', 'help', '3-D', 'motion', 'capture', 'animation', 'rubber-limbed', 'talents', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'What', 'flick', 'tendency', 'overuse', '3-D', 'tricks', 'trade', 'very', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Dickens', 'work', 'mood', 'detail', 'unusual', 'twist', 'Carrey', 'not', 'only', 'role', 'miserly', 'Scrooge', 'incarnations', 'also', 'roles', 'three', 'Christmas', 'Spirits', 'who', 'haunt', 'credit', 'Carrey', 'underplay', 'miser', 'making', 'more', 'believable', 'result', 'also', 'very', 'effective', 'interpretations', 'Christmas', 'Past', 'Yet', 'Come', 'only', 'Christmas', 'Present', 'displaying', 'hint', 'usual', 'penchant', 'overact', 'Carrey', 'also', 'given', 'solid', 'support', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Marley', 'Ghost', 'Bob', 'Cratchit', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Fezziwig', 'Old', 'Joe', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'Belle', 'Fan', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'nice', 'contrast', 'Carrey', 'role', 'Fred', 'Scrooge', 'nephew.Zemeckis', 'handsome', 'production', 'faithfully', 'Victorian', 'London', 'supported', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'Alan', 'Silvestri', 'Zemeckis', 'screenplay', 'also', 'justice', 'tale', 'presenting', 'many', 'darker', 'tend', 'get', 'ignored', 'many', 'other', 'adaptations', 'Indeed', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'images', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'too', 'strong', 'very', 'young', 'audiences', 'Overall', 'film', 'be', 'delightfully', 'strong', 'entry', 'list', 'worthy', 'CAROL', 'adaptations', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",Disney's A Christmas Carol

While the creators patted themselves on the back about how faithful they were to the spirit (pun intended, I'm sure) of how Dickens probably visualized the movie, I had to see for myself, of course.Then I watched the movie.  All of my comments are based on what I have always felt about this classic.The good:* A very good Scrooge.  Jim Carrey's Scrooge is the Scrooge of my imagination, from my childhood.  This is one time I have to agree with the creators of the film.  This was the perfect Scrooge.* A very good Tiny Tim.  Ditto for everything I said about Scrooge, this was the perfect Tiny Tim.*  The doorknocker. FINALLY! One that's true to the book!*  Jacob Marley rocked. The best, ever. Dickens described the ghost of Marley as having an ""atmosphere"" about him and this movie displayed that.  This was great.* A very good Ghost of Christmas Past. While this is quite different from what I had always pictured, I liked the interpretation.* I'm in my late 50s and have been reading this book every year since I was a child (raised my children on that tradition), and have been disappointed with most movie characterizations of these main characters.  If it took ""motion capture"" to get there, then that's okay.  It works.* The scenery was stellar.* I have a blu-ray, so really enjoy the increased resolution. As expected, excellent Disney attention to detail.The not so good:* Miniaturizing Scrooge. Really?  Couldn't get past the silliness factor of that idea, especially since there seemed no plausible reason as to why it was necessary in the telling of the story.  How in the world was *that* true to what Dickens meant?* The whole 3D thing was, in my opinion, somewhat overdone.  There are a lot of great parts that I feel were left out in favor of the 3D experiences which had nothing to do with the book.*  The Ghost of Christmas Future had this whole Darth Vader-ish mojo going when they finally did a closeup of his face.*  Considering the amount of detail and work put into the movie overall, I was surprised that the ending was so truncated.  Not *disappointed* because it was more accurate than Scrooge running around the floor with a rat (this *is* Disney, after all), but surprised.* Little details of the book that somehow got either dropped or not fleshed out the way that I expected from a version that was supposed to be ""very true to the spirit"" of the book.The unfleshed:* Only one person in Old Joe's* Fred's party* Only one of the fund-raisers met with Scrooge after his experience* Bob Cratchit speaking of meeting Scrooge's nephew after Tiny Tim's deathand a few others...The deleted:* The hearse up the stairs.*  Scrooge's praises of Fezziwig*  The complete breakup of Scrooge & Belle*  Belle's family sceneThere were several others, but these few scenes were very key to the telling of the story, and I feel that they were eliminated because of the 3D action gimmickry parts.Overall, I felt that it was a very good interpretation of the book.  It may be a little scary for youngsters, but it *is,* after all, a Ghost story.  I found myself getting quite impatient with many of the parts made to emphasize the 3D effects (flying through the air over roofs and chimneys, getting stuck in the curtain rings, riding an icicle, etc.) because I felt that *some point* it detracted more than added to the quality of the movie.

The third time's not the charm; this rendition is my all time least favorite edition of Dicken's classic.There's a story in Ray Bradbury's ""The Illustrated Man"", that had authors like Egdar Allen Poe on Mars because their books were burned on earth; Dickens was there because of the ghosts in this story. The filmmakers seemed to believe that this allowed them to make this more of a horror movie than the predecessors; it managed to keep a straight PG rating, but I won't be surprised if the board considered bumping it up to PG-13.This re-telling of the classic tale of redemption is not completely removed of redeeming qualities. Technically, the special effects of this movie are great. My wife noticed two references of people wishing Scrooge good health even though the good will was one-sided at that time. I also liked this version having Cratchett tell the postscript.However, the story is as strong as Scrooge. Jim Carey's Scrooge comes across as creepy from scene one. And the special effects are the star here, having Scrooge shrunk to mouse size at one point and being chased by ghostly horses for a long sequence.My favorite version is Patrick Stewart's, where the actor holds his own with the special effects in that rendition. I also think Allistair Sims' was a much superior version. In fact, the Muppets was better (I haven't seen Mickey's, but I wouldn't be surprised if I like that one better as well).",3,Only A Ghost Of The Greatness Of This Story,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,1540,"['Disney', 'third', 'version', 'story', 'following', 'Mickey', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Muppet', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'third', 'time', 'not', 'charm', 'rendition', 'time', 'least', 'favorite', 'edition', 'Dicken', 'classic.There', 'story', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'Illustrated', 'Man', 'had', 'authors', 'Egdar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'Mars', 'books', 'were', 'burned', 'earth', 'Dickens', 'was', 'there', 'ghosts', 'story', 'filmmakers', 'seemed', 'believe', 'allowed', 'make', 'more', 'horror', 'movie', 'predecessors', 'managed', 'keep', 'straight', 'PG', 'rating', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'board', 'considered', 'bumping', 'PG-13.This', 're-telling', 'classic', 'tale', 'redemption', 'not', 'completely', 'removed', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'Technically', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'great', 'wife', 'noticed', 'two', 'references', 'people', 'wishing', 'Scrooge', 'good', 'health', 'even', 'good', 'will', 'was', 'one-sided', 'time', 'also', 'liked', 'version', 'having', 'Cratchett', 'tell', 'postscript.However', 'story', 'as', 'strong', 'Scrooge', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'Scrooge', 'creepy', 'scene', 'one', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'star', 'here', 'having', 'Scrooge', 'shrunk', 'mouse', 'size', 'one', 'point', 'being', 'chased', 'ghostly', 'horses', 'long', 'sequence.My', 'favorite', 'version', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'where', 'actor', 'own', 'special', 'effects', 'rendition', 'also', 'think', 'Allistair', 'Sims', 'was', 'much', 'superior', 'version', 'fact', 'Muppets', 'was', 'better', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Mickey', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'like', 'one', 'better', 'well']",Disney's A Christmas Carol
1355027,A27W5AJNP6YX7Z,B003NFM3JK,"Ivy Bewley ""Hiedra""","[1, 2]","I read A Christmas Carol when I was a kid. It was an abridged version, if I recall. So I am familiar with the story, not the book. I was watching the special features on this movie, and they were talking about how this book, even though it was written so long ago, really lends itself well to the animation process, because there are so many things actors can't physically do. And, this is the most faithful adaptation ever. Of course, if you watch the special features on any movie, even one that got horrible reviews, you will hear the actors and backstage people brag about how well they interpreted everything, what a fine cast they had, how perfectly it all came about, etc.Well, I did enjoy the movie. I enjoyed the animation. I can't really say how faithful it was to the book because I read it too long ago. But the basic story seemed to be there. Scrooge's change from penny-pinching to generous seemed a little abrupt to me. It seemed more from fear than learning. I can agree that they did things that were physically impossible and needed animation for. But then I wonder... why did they use motion capture? They had to set up all those weird contraptions to move around the actors, and then animate most of it anyway. Doesn't that just make it all a lot harder? Like doing it twice? They said (bragged) in the special features that using all the dots on the actors' faces allowed them to capture all the nuances of the actors' expressions. But then, animators on regular computer-animated movies are pretty proud of the expressions they come up with for their characters, too. I don't really get it. Their characters didn't look any more expressive then characters in movies like Shrek. I think they just made more work for themselves. But what the heck. The actors said it was a lot of fun.Well anyway, I enjoyed WATCHING the movie. I didn't get to see the 3-D version. I'm not a Christmas Carol aficionado with tons of things to compare it to.

1355033,A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K,B003NFM3JK,"Jared Castle ""Oregon writer""","[2, 5]","In the hands of Robert Zemeckis and Jim Carrey, Ebenezer Scrooge's tale delivers moments of true emotion - frightening, heartbreaking and uplifting. Yet, neither the 3-D animation nor Carrey's multi-character act elevate this version to the status of a Christmas classic.I preface I'm writing this review as a father of two sons (ages 8 and 6). We popped popcorn, poured glasses of Arnold Palmer and slipped into our pajamas for a family movie night. Having recently enjoyedThe Muppet Christmas Carol, I hoped my sons could enjoy (and follow) a gloomier interpretation of Dickens' classic that followed the original story closer than I had expected.Zemeckis employs the performance-capture technique previously used inThe Polar ExpressandBeowulf. The animation provides some amazing visuals, making it possible for Scrooge to fly Victorian England or shrink to mouse size for an icicle ride across rooftops. The ghost of Marley and the Ghost of Christmas Future were exceptionally scary (my six-year jumped when Marley's visage first appeared on Scrooge's doorknocker). However, the animation distracts as much as it dazzles, especially during longer stretches of dialogue. Aside from the skeletal Scrooge, Zemeckis envisions the rest of the cast as a fleshy, pig-faced people whose ugliness is off-putting.Scrooge is an amalgamation of Carrey's previous roles. You'll see a sneer that echoes Count Olaf fromLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Eventsand then hear a laugh reminiscent of The Grinch fromHow the Grinch Stole Christmas. Carrey's performances as the Ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future are for vanity's sake. My six-year old detected the same actor played Scrooge and the Ghosts, a revelation that only served to pull him from the narrative.Robin Wright Penn, Gary Oldman, Cary Elwes and Bob Hoskins join Carrey in playing multiple roles. It is hard to understand why though because only Oldman, who portrays both Jacob Marley and Bob Cratchit, delivers two unique and satisfying performances. Marley is gruesome (much more horrifying than the Ghost of Christmas Future), while Cratchit is endearing and childlike, especially so during his commute home on Christmas Eve.In summary, this movie is a mess and falls well short of being a Christmas classic. Dickens classic proves beyond the creative talents of Carrey and Zemeckis, who are unsure how to present this tale. Dark and gloomy dialogue is followed byTom and Jerryaction scenes.Rating: Two stars.If you have young children, I recommendThe Muppet Christmas Carolinstead.",2,Dickens classic proves beyond the creative talents of Carrey and Zemeckis,1292630400,"12 18, 2010",2010,2556,"['hands', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Ebenezer', 'Scrooge', 'tale', 'delivers', 'moments', 'true', 'emotion', 'frightening', 'heartbreaking', 'uplifting', '3-D', 'animation', 'Carrey', 'multi-character', 'act', 'elevate', 'version', 'status', 'Christmas', 'classic.I', 'preface', ""'m"", 'writing', 'review', 'father', 'two', 'sons', 'ages', '8', '6', 'popped', 'popcorn', 'poured', 'glasses', 'Arnold', 'Palmer', 'slipped', 'pajamas', 'family', 'movie', 'night', 'Having', 'recently', 'enjoyedThe', 'Muppet', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'hoped', 'sons', 'could', 'enjoy', 'follow', 'gloomier', 'interpretation', 'Dickens', 'classic', 'followed', 'original', 'story', 'closer', 'had', 'expected.Zemeckis', 'performance-capture', 'technique', 'previously', 'used', 'inThe', 'Polar', 'ExpressandBeowulf', 'animation', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'making', 'possible', 'Scrooge', 'fly', 'Victorian', 'England', 'shrink', 'mouse', 'size', 'icicle', 'ride', 'rooftops', 'ghost', 'Marley', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Future', 'were', 'exceptionally', 'scary', 'six-year', 'jumped', 'when', 'Marley', 'visage', 'first', 'appeared', 'Scrooge', 'doorknocker', 'However', 'animation', 'as', 'much', 'especially', 'longer', 'stretches', 'dialogue', 'Aside', 'skeletal', 'Scrooge', 'Zemeckis', 'rest', 'cast', 'fleshy', 'pig-faced', 'people', 'ugliness', 'off-putting.Scrooge', 'amalgamation', 'Carrey', 'previous', 'roles', ""'ll"", 'see', 'sneer', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'fromLemony', 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Eventsand', 'then', 'hear', 'laugh', 'reminiscent', 'Grinch', 'fromHow', 'Grinch', 'Stole', 'Christmas', 'Carrey', 'performances', 'Ghosts', 'Christmases', 'Past', 'Present', 'Future', 'are', 'vanity', 'sake', 'six-year', 'old', 'detected', 'same', 'actor', 'played', 'Scrooge', 'Ghosts', 'revelation', 'only', 'served', 'pull', 'narrative.Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'join', 'Carrey', 'playing', 'multiple', 'roles', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'though', 'only', 'Oldman', 'who', 'Jacob', 'Marley', 'Bob', 'Cratchit', 'two', 'unique', 'satisfying', 'performances', 'Marley', 'gruesome', 'much', 'more', 'horrifying', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Future', 'Cratchit', 'endearing', 'childlike', 'especially', 'so', 'commute', 'home', 'Christmas', 'Eve.In', 'summary', 'movie', 'mess', 'well', 'short', 'being', 'Christmas', 'classic', 'Dickens', 'classic', 'creative', 'talents', 'Carrey', 'Zemeckis', 'who', 'are', 'unsure', 'how', 'present', 'tale', 'Dark', 'gloomy', 'dialogue', 'followed', 'byTom', 'Jerryaction', 'scenes.Rating', 'Two', 'stars.If', 'have', 'young', 'children', 'recommendThe', 'Muppet', 'Christmas', 'Carolinstead']",Disney's A Christmas Carol

Some scenes are recreated in a serious, dramatic way that really convey the spirit of the book.  The passing scenes of 19th century London life add a lot of atmosphere and Carrey does a great (serious) job with the voices.  Then - bam! - some visual gag is thrown in that's reminiscent of Carrey's physical comedy in other movies or a Bugs Bunny cartoon and you're thinking ""where did that come from?""; then just as abruptly it switches back to the standard dramatic story.  The physical comedy might work for little kids but the movie also has some scenes that are too scary/disturbing for young children, so who exactly is their audience?  The last straw for me was a chase scene (really, a chase scene) that was clearly thrown in to show off the particle/water/physics effects of their animation engine, as if we haven't all seen enough animated water by now; you could almost hear the programmers saying ""oh! oh! can we throw this in, it will look so cool.""If it was supposed to be a comedy, it should have been lighthearted throughout.

1355038,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B003NFM3JK,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[0, 0]","Director Robert Zemeckis (The Polar Express, Forrest Gump) has scored again with this excellent animated version of Charles Dickens' classic holiday tale.  Jim Carrey stars as Ebenezer Scrooge, a crotchety old man who cares nothing about others or the holiday season.  He prefers to spend his time alone in his office or home, sitting in front of the fire.  He also belittles his employee Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman), despite his young son's illness.On one such evening, Scrooge is in his customary place in front of the fireplace when a ghostly spirit visits him.  The spirit informs Scrooge that he is the Ghost of Christmas Past, and he takes Scrooge on a journey to the Christmases he had as a child and young man.  Scrooge sees where he went to school, and the holiday ball he attended with a girl that later became his wife.  The marriage ended in divorce.  Another spirit, The Ghost of Christmas Present, shows Scrooge the events of the current holiday, including the Cratchit family toasting him for his supplying Bob with a job.  Finally, the Ghost of Christmas Future shows Scrooge close to death, and the town members are rejoicing his passing.  Also, the Cratchits mourn the loss of Tiny Tim.All of these spirits have a profound effect on Scrooge himself.  Soon, he's singing carols in the street, skating behind carriages, and asking people for forgiveness for the way he treated them in the past.  No one is more surprised at Scrooge's miraculous transformation than Bob Cratchit.This is an excellent movie.  I've been a Zemeckis fan for years, and my family and I watch ""The Polar Express"" every Christmas season.  I'm sure ""A Christmas Carol"" will become regular holiday viewing for us, too.  The special effects in the film are astounding, and the story contains a fine moral lesson to be learned.  Make ""A Christmas Carol"" part of your regular holiday viewing.  Your family will love it.

Rooney,"[1, 1]","Over the years I've seen at least a dozen versions of Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"", and this one, dynamic and evocative, ranks among the very best, I saw it in an Imax theater in three D, and the special effects were stunning. The very rapidly moving aerial views of London were spectacular with a beautiful shot of St. Paul's Cathedral. Victorian England came to life because the director had paid attention to detail, authenticity. The wintry, slippery streets of London were part of the atmospherics.I was never really aware that Scrooge was being played by Jim Carrey because the make-up and computer effects similar to ""Polar Express"" submerged and camouflaged the person. He did a great job, even better by my lights because I've never been much of a Carrey fan. The sharp jutting chin in the young and old Scrooge reminded me of a character drawn by Toulouse-Lautrec. Scrooge was amazingly thin and emaciated. The three ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future are all played by Carrey though I never realized until I read the credits.The movie was fast-paced. I have seen rather stately, pokey versions in the past, but this one zipped along as it concentrated almost entirely on Scrooge. The three visits of the three Christmas ghosts initiated by the dead partner Marley were done with alacrity. Scrooge goes flying off into space like a rocket.This film has a comic book or graphic novel look to it with some scenes looking like drawings, paintings that have come to life. There are some funny touches as when Scrooge balks or shows a wise guy side as he talks to the ghosts. You get the essentials of the story, a lot of action and movement, without being bogged down by some of the old familiar stuff. The Roger de Coverley dance in Scrooge's past was well done. Some of the characters in the dance sequence are Pickwickian. Scrooge's stinginess and acquisitiveness are evoked by the stacks of coins on his desk as a young and old man.The street scenes were cleverly recreated. Kids were rolling hoops with sticks, sliding down icy hills on their feet which Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman) imitates later. Some kids hitched themselves onto the rear of fast-moving wagons and foot-skied behind, and Scrooge does it after his redemption. Of course the theme of the story is how the real spirit of Christmas can bring about redemption.It has a truly Dickensian flavor using some of his actual dialogue, description and narration. The Cratchits' prosaic roasted goose inspires Scrooge to send them a turkey.For kiddies and adults in the audience the story comes alive with added dimensions. This is a reimagined version, done with originality and creativity.

There are some glaring changes that really take away from the beauty of this classic story.Changes for 3D effect:1. The ""flying"" effect with the Ghost of Christmas Present was not, was not even implied, in the Dickens story.2. Scrooge being chased around the streets of London after meeting the Ghost of Christmas Future.3. Scrooge being shrunk to the size of a mouse, running around the London sewers, snowboarding with an icicle, and getting nearly pounded by Joe the rag and bones man.Changes made for no apparent reason:1. Many important scenes are left out that show the progression of Scrooge from greedy miser to keep of Christmas all year long.2. The Ghost of Christmas Present dies, rots to a skeleton, turns to dust, and is blown away by the wind.One change that really, really got on my nerves was the Ghost of Christmas Present making a dig at ""men of the cloth."" I don't know if the writer/director/producer was trying to be overtly anti-Christian here, but that's surely the way it comes off. (Which makes you wonder why they'd make a movie about the miracle of Christmas if they want to be anti-Christian.)The result is a movie that falls well short of the great film it could have been. For one, it scared my daughter (3 years old) quite a bit; the movie is loud and spends a lot of time getting ""in your face"" for the 3D effects. Also, have I mentioned that the Ghost of Christmas Present, who of course looks a lot like Santa, DIES...and TURNS INTO A SKELETON!There are some nice extras on the disk.

First, the animators seemed to not be able to decide if the characters were ""realistic"" or ""cartoons.""  The result is that too many characters simply look deformed.  Second, just because they could do animated ""fly-bys"" impossible with live film, they beat the concept to death with too many shots that defy physics. But, worst of all, the film seems to have been infected with that subtle sense of meanness that is lurking around the edges of so many Jim Carey movies. And this is one instance where it simply doesn't work. The Christmas morning ending lightens up considerably..too bad the bulk of the film was not like it. And, although taken from the book, there is a gratuitous swipe at clergy or ""men of the cloth"" that has nothing to do with the plot, but is social commentary from the 1800's. Essentially stating (by the Ghost of Christmas Present) that men of the cloth have little to do with the spirit of Christmas reeks of some kind of agenda that is totally out of place in this film.

So, I rented it and was amazed.  The graphics were exceptional.  Everything was immensely beautiful.  Even more than that though, the thing I was the most pleased with was how they chose to stay faithful to the original story by Dickens.  They chose to respect his work, so I am so much the more inclined to respect them for it.  Good job all around.The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five was for the few times they chose to abandon Dickens' story line.  There was one scene in particular where Scrooge asks the ghost of Christmas present why he chose to have all of the stores in town close down one day a week.  I assume he is referring to the Sabbath.  The ghost of Christmas present then rebukes organized religion by telling Scrooge to not blame him for the mistakes made by ""so called men of the cloth who claim to know me.""

I'll simply say that Carrey is brilliant in his multiple roles; he's the Scrooge for the Ages.What I really want to rave about is the visual special FX of this production, especially the 3-D format, which will most assuredly be nominated for an Oscar. The opening sequence, in which the virtual camera soars over and through a marvelously re-created 1842 London, is worth the price of admission alone. My wife and I watched the film from the front row of an invitation-only studio screening. During a couple of scenes depicting falling snow, it seemed, through our 3-D glasses, that we could reach out and touch the descending flakes. And one is tempted to flinch backwards as the blackened, skeletal, claw-hand of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come apparently reaches out from the screen.It's been decades since I read the Dickens classic. (At least, I think I read it; memory fails.) I suspect that literary purists may object to embellishments of the original story, and over-protective parents may judge it too dark for small children. I say to those, ""Get over it!""

Rivera,"[6, 7]","One of the most impressively effective and beautiful 3D movies ever rendered for the new 3D generation.I have to say that I saw this movie in 3D at theaters.. and it was ok. I say that because I thoroughly enjoyed it, but didn't think the 3D was as phenomenal as other films. I was hesitant to purchase it again on Bluray-3D simply for this fact, but got it through Amazon's Disney discount offer, which made the purchase at a value. Wow, was I wrong with the 3D effects.The movie looks GORGEOUS on my 3D television. The story is amazingly well done, if not a bit creepy in some parts. It does push the boundaries of a PG film. Some parts, especially the Jacob Marley and third ghost of Christmas Future, are almost too frightening for small children, especially in 3D. But older kids (~8-10 yrs old) would probably love it, even if they do not understand what is being said. The movie uses almost exact prose from the Dickens masterpiece, therefore adults would understand the speech more than their children- after all, the original story by Mr. Charles was written as a ghost story intended for adults rather than for children. The underlying themes and ideas are great for all ages, but better understood and directed towards the lives of adults in this corruptive world that we live in.Pay no mind to the harsh reviews of others here on Amazon, the movie is excellent. A classic! Jim Carrey truly delivers his best performance, something that my father will watch and be impressed to know that it is actually the goofy, suggestive man that he once despised as Ace Ventura. A redeeming performance on his behalf for a movie of redemption during the holiday season. Zemeckis adds his eye-candy flavor to an already well-established tale to make this a fun and rewarding experience that rivals other holiday films for the best movie to enjoy next to a crackling fire on Christmas Eve.

1355063,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B003NFM3JK,Kathy W,"[2, 2]","I just saw this one in the theater.  I chose the 3-D showing.  You know the famous Charles Dickens' story.  It is the same basic story line, but done in the computer animation that makes the characters look about as close to human as possible, at least for now.  I almost forget they are not real, except the eyes never look quite right.  The computer graphics are phenomenal, the color is beautiful, and the picture is sharp.  If you saw Disney's Polar Express, it is the same animation quality.  It is hard for me to believe this is Jim Carrey.  It doesn't even sound like him.  He does a fantastic job with Scrooge.  I watch the Scrooge story every Christmas season, probably several times.The story begins on Christmas Eve.  Jacob Marley has died and Scrooge has made arrangements with the undertaker for a nice wooden box.  Scrooge reluctantly pays the undertaker and whisks around to scarf up the tuppences that lay on Marley's eyes, telling a young boy that it is money (and not to be wasted).The sun is shining brightly outside and the snow is lightly falling, providing a multi-dimensional effect while wearing your 3-D glasses.  Snow falls through most of the picture.  We hear singing and move through the streets of old London, watching the street vendors hulk their wares.  Scrooge moves through the streets, grouching the whole time.  It's what he does best, you know.  As Scrooge enters the storefront marked by the sign ""Scrooge and Marley,""  the ""M"" begins to wiggle.Fast forward 7 years, to the anniversary of Marley's death.  We find Scrooge and Bob Cratchett working in the cold, cold office on Christmas Eve.  Cratchett is freezing his little buns off but dare not place another chunk of coal on the fire.  As a matter of fact, I think the coal box had a lock on it.  (Heck, one piece of coal is enough.  Who needs feeling in their fingers anyway?)  Nephew Fred stops by to visit Uncle Scrooge and gets the bah humbug routine.  The two gents come in, asking for a donation for charity and Scrooge delivers the famous ""Let them die and decrease the surface population"" line.Scrooge closes for the evening, reminding Cratchett it is not fair that he be off all day on Christmas, being paid for no work, and he need be there early on December 26!  They part company, Cratchett scurrying to be merry and Scrooge grouching home to be Scrooge.The fun begins as we see Scrooge's door knocker come alive, glowing with Marley's face!  Scrooge is seriously creeped out, even after he runs upstairs and locks everthing behind him.  As he cowers in his chair, the 4 bells above the inside of his door begin to ring, no BANG--loudly, followed by the entrance of (guess who?) J-A-C-O-B  M-A-R-L-E-Y!Of course, like I said, you know the story.  The 3 ghosts visit and the computer animations allow for a nice level of visual entertainment as they take Scrooge to the past, present, and the possible future.

Wallace ""kirby at  wallaceinfo dee-o...","[3, 5]","First, just because the Disney name is attached, do not think for a moment that this is a movie suitable for young children.  It is not.  Who it is suitable for is fully grown adults.  The visual effects are absolutely stunning, and the story is very faithful to the actual Dickens book.  Frankly, it can be quite disturbing to young viewers.  But it can also be disturbing to adult viewers in a way that Dickens himself would most likely have approved.  In fact, I think it relays the message he intended to relay: Fear death now while ye yet live and can make changes.I knew from the moment that Jacob Marley made his deathly appearance, wrapped in chains that he forged in life, that this was going to be a moving experience.Scrooge: ""What do you want with me?""Marley (dragging his chains): ""Ooooh, much! ... Aaaaaahg!""Throughout his conversation with Scrooge, he is preoccupied with looking at the chains he is bound with.  ""I wear the chains I forged in life.  I made it link by link and yard by yard.  Can you recognize it's pattern?  Can you imagine the lengths and weight of the chain you bear?  Yours is a ponderous chain"".The ghost of Christmas past is ghostly, and his voice is like the flickering of the candle he is represented as.  The Ghost of Christmas Present dies as though by heart attack while a giant bell tolls.  And the Ghost of Christmas yet to Come is, frankly, frightening - even to an adult.  He appears as nothing more than something like a three dimensional shadow.  The kind of thing that makes me wish I had seen this one, at least, in 3D on the big screen.The story is fantastically faithful to the original text as penned by Dickens.

There has never been a more perfect holiday tale and I was concerned about the possibility of an over-the-top Carrey performance. As it turns out, Jim Carrey was wonderful...HOWEVER, since seeing the movie I'm wondering what the developers of the project were thinking? The first fifteen minutes of the film had me believing I was viewing a version  that would join the Alastair Sim and George C. Scott versions in the holiday classics hall-of-fame. However, as the film continued the purity of Dickens' story was compromised with chase scenes and a shrinking Ebenezer Scrooge. Come on!! The screen time could have been better used telling the complete story and developing the other major characters...Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim, his nephew Fred and Belle. These characters were crucial to Scrooge's reclamation and their importance were, for the most part, trivialized. There were stellar moments...for example, the visitation by Marley's ghost and the scene in the Cratchit home after Tiny Tim's death, but they were too few and far between. Visually the film was absolutely stunning! Some of the ""special effects"" were wonderful...others just didn't fit the story. The problem with the film, I believe, is that the target audience was not well defined. It appeared at times to target an adult audience and then it would abruptly shift to some rediculous scene clearly intended to satisfy children. If I had wanted to see a children's version I would have rented ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" or ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"". The film is basically true to Dickens' marvelous story but is, at best, a ghostly apparition (pun intended) of the original...it just didn't have enough substance. Entertaining? Yes. Worthwhile seeing? Yes, particularing at an IMAX theater.

1355085,A334ORI2SLEQAO,B003NFM3JK,Lost in Thawt,"[3, 7]","This caricature of Charles Dickens' wonderful Christmas story was not only a complete disappointment, it was a pointless attempt at humor.  Beginning with completely skipping over Ebenezer Scrooge's walk home from his office on Christmas Eve when the first hint of something unusual happening (the ghost horses and hearse)became evident, to the Ghost of Christmas Past portrayed as a disembodied head with its skull on fire, hovering over the ghostly shoulders of a weird little body, and on to an almost total bastardization of a Christmas classic, the kindest thing I can think of to say about this film is, ""Shame on Disney.""I was aware before I bought this DVD, of course, that the characters were not real people, but rather computer graphics, but that seemed like it might be kind of a fun film.  I have the movie ""The Polar Express,"" and there are no ""real people"" in that either, and most of the Polar Express voices belong to Tom Hanks, and that's a most enjoyable film.  But as it turns out here, Jim Carrey as the voice of Scrooge, minus that fantastic talent for visual comedy, was a real loss of what I thought was good potential for an enjoyable version of A Christmas Carol.I agree with the statement of a couple other reviewers that there are a few questionable scenes in what would most likely be considered a children's movie since it was made by Disney, scenes that might be frightening to young children.  Having viewed this movie, if I had young children, I'd be very reluctant to allow them to watch this one.For a delightful presentation of a different spin on the Christmas Carol movie, the musical version ""Scrooge"" is the best so far.",1,What a total waste of time and money.....,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,1660,"['caricature', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'wonderful', 'Christmas', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'complete', 'disappointment', 'was', 'pointless', 'attempt', 'humor', 'Beginning', 'completely', 'skipping', 'over', 'Ebenezer', 'Scrooge', 'walk', 'home', 'office', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'when', 'first', 'hint', 'something', 'unusual', 'happening', 'ghost', 'horses', 'hearse', 'became', 'evident', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Past', 'portrayed', 'disembodied', 'head', 'skull', 'fire', 'hovering', 'ghostly', 'shoulders', 'weird', 'little', 'body', 'almost', 'total', 'bastardization', 'Christmas', 'classic', 'kindest', 'thing', 'can', 'think', 'say', 'film', 'Shame', 'Disney', 'was', 'aware', 'bought', 'DVD', 'course', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'real', 'people', 'rather', 'computer', 'graphics', 'seemed', 'might', 'be', 'kind', 'fun', 'film', 'have', 'movie', 'Polar', 'Express', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'most', 'Polar', 'Express', 'voices', 'belong', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'out', 'here', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'voice', 'Scrooge', 'minus', 'fantastic', 'talent', 'visual', 'comedy', 'was', 'real', 'loss', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'potential', 'enjoyable', 'version', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol.I', 'agree', 'statement', 'couple', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'few', 'questionable', 'scenes', 'what', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'considered', 'children', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Disney', 'scenes', 'might', 'be', 'frightening', 'young', 'children', 'Having', 'viewed', 'movie', 'had', 'young', 'children', ""'d"", 'be', 'very', 'reluctant', 'allow', 'watch', 'delightful', 'presentation', 'different', 'spin', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'movie', 'musical', 'version', 'Scrooge', 'best', 'so', 'far']",Disney's A Christmas Carol

1355088,ABCE4OXCDHEQL,B003NFM3JK,Mark Blackburn,"[156, 197]","I came with an open mind. This, after all was the story my father had told us children, when we were snuggled up warm in our beds. He would plant a dining room chair in the hallway. And from memory he recited ""the story of Scrooge.""  It was a little frightening, to be lying there in darkness, a bit of light streaming in from the hallway, as your father's voice suddenly turned all funny. He became, in turn, three spirits - voices different from Scrooge's own.Dad did that each Christmas eve. Until we grew ""too old for that,"" as he explained one year while putting his shaving soap on the tree, after putting up all the decorations, including the battered angel - the one my Mom got, that first Christmas in 1936 when Dad planted his first kiss on her lips, as they danced (he said) to English band leader Ray Noble's THE TOUCH OF YOUR LIPS.Pardon my reverie . . . I just wanted to establish my credentials, for saying . . .This is not merely the best version of my favorite story (Dad would tell you that; if he were alive this would be his 92nd Christmas).  No, no. This is the most amazing ""movie experience"" that I have ever known. I cannot imagine how any film maker(s) could ever top this.They had me hooked from the opening.  The camera shows a beautifully bound copy of ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens. An invisible hand opens to the first page and those very words my own father composed . . .Marley was dead: to begin with.  There is no doubt whatever about that.  The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner.  Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge's name was good . . .  for anything he chose to put his hand to.  Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.We see a corpse, its eyes held shut with pennies. Scrooge himself removes them from the eyes, at the end of the scene saying, without shame to the undertakers, while rubbing the coins together between thumb and finger, ""Tuppence is tuppence!"" The subtle change in the undertaker's face -- so subtle you might miss it in the half light of the almost dark room -- is one of dismay at seeing someone THAT cheap. The facial expression borders on horror.Out in the street, children stop playing and dogs duck into alleys at Mr. Scrooge's approach, on his way to his place of business, with its gilt-lettered sign, ""Scrooge & Marley Co.""  That will also be the closing scene of the movie, with Scrooge seen through frosty windows to be dancing with sheer, child-like joy, while outside, Bob Cratchit, for the very first time, turns to the `camera' and addresses us:(Those very words my father composed out of thin air, Christmas 1949!)""Scrooge was better than his word.  He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father.  He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew [and] ever afterwards, it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge.  May that be truly said of us, and all of us!  And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God Bless Us, Every One!""I could share with you a hundred little details (the sort of details that otherwise concern ""God and the Devil""). But ""Let there be light!"" sums up the effect on your eyes, as we see clearly despite only the very faintest light sources: and that is what sets this movie apart from any other ever made.You're not conscious of it at first. Then it dawns on you. An entire scene has been done in the light of a distant street lamp.  The lamp (never seen) is about 50 feet to your left.  Your eyes are drawn to the wrought iron fence outside Scrooge's rather magnificent home.  The camera goes in tight, and the texture of the wrought iron - you know the tiny little waves made by a ball peine hammer on the surface of the metal when it was forged . . . the light from that unseen street lamp, 50 feet distant, is just enough for you to see a glint of yellow on the shiny black metal finish.This `cinematography' - working at light levels so low, they could never be captured by a digital `film' camera - is repeated in scene after scene.  It makes the sunshine on Scrooge's face, and on Tiny Tim, held aloft on Scrooge's shoulder at movie's end so . . . welcome!  Light has been used (finally!) to underline Scrooge's utter, endless joy (your own too).I don't know if you, like me, will sit there, tears of joy streaming down your face, watching the closing credits. Only three other people were left in the theatre as the scroll of credits reached its end. (I watched this one with my mentally-handicapped friend ""Michael"" - please see our review of the last `best' Christmas movie ""POLAR EXPRESS"").A couple and their 14 year old son sitting just ahead of us, delayed their departure, putting on their coats, discreetly so as not to block the view of the only two persons left watching intently. As if to explain my tear-stained face, I said to the woman (an investment counselor as it turns out): ""I have to see who wrote that stirring `carol' --- a (mainly) men's choir led by a truly great tenor.  Sure enough, the music was written by the last great film score composer, Alan Silvestri. He co-wrote all those wondrous songs like ""When Christmas Comes to Town"" for Polar Express; all the great incidental music for ""Forrest Gump"" too!The couple's son explained how the 3-D glasses work. Oh yes. His mother had opened our conversation saying, ""I actually caught one of those snowflakes"" (felt it in her hand).  Her son said (not convincingly to his Dad) ""the snow looks (better) the closer you are to the screen.""  Together, they noticed that my friend Michael was still wearing his 3-D glasses, while sipping the last of his diet coke.""Michael,"" I said, ""is from a L'Arche home,"" waiting to see if the term `registered.' ""That's for mentally-handicapped,"" volunteered Michael.  Oh yes, and Michael agreed with me when I said, ""that's the best movie I have ever seen.""Mark BlackburnWinnipeg Manitoba Canada",5,Best movie of all time (not just 'cause my Dad wrote the

1355089,A2KI1SGCZT2OEI,B003NFM3JK,"Mark E. Stenroos ""Sibelius fan""","[0, 0]","For the past 40-odd years, my standard in filmed versions of Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" has been the Alastair Sim version from 1951. That remains my standard to this day.Based on 1983's unsuccessful ""Mickey's Christmas Carol,"" I was prepared for Disney to once again screw up this classic tale with ""Disney's A Christmas Carol."" Jim Carrey's name emblazoned across the 3-sheets added to the sense of trepidation.Well, I was wrong. Quite wrong, to be honest about it. This is an excellent version of Dickens' classic tale, a version that hews much closer to the book than most other versions out there, including my beloved Sim version. The fantasy elements are here given the room to be fantastic, which really works if one believes that Scrooge's journey to redemption may well have happened in his dreams, rather than in the here and now (pace Mr Dickens' admonition to his readers concerning the veracity of his tale).Jim Carrey voices and acts most of the main characters in this version, and he's very good at creating unique characterizations that really delineate the players from each other. He is masterful in his portrayal of the Ghost of Christmas Past, somehow speaking in a way that one would imagine a flame would speak had it voice to do so. His Ghost of Christmas Present is also good, a larger-than-life figure who stands in stark contrast to Scrooge's disconnected-from-humanity self. Carrey's Scrooge is - dare I say it - loaded with subtleties that I really didn't expect from him. His voice characterization is spot on, and SO much closer to what one would expect from a faithful rendition of what Dickens penned than say, the disastrous performance of George C. Scott in his 1980's TV version of the tale.Credit is also due to Gary Oldman's portrayal of Bob Cratchit and - even more so - his Ghost of Jacob Marley, which has to be seen to be believed. One cannot imagine a truer version of Dickens' vision than that achieved in this film's combination of acting, motion capture and animation. Spooky and VERY convincing.The only caveat I'll voice about the movie concerns a couple of extended ""action sequences"" that were included to no doubt keep the teens and tweens engrossed in the film. Most egregious among these is the scene where Scrooge is chased through the streets of London by a hellish C&oacute;iste Bodhar. It really adds nothing to the story, even if the animation is particularly good.Not everyone is a fan of motion-capture technology, but I feel it serves this film well, bridging the gap between live-action and animation versions of the story and maybe coming away with the best of both worlds. Robert Zemeckis and crew have gained expertise in their use of the technique since ""The Polar Express,"" and it pays dividends here.The extras included are very interesting, especially a feature that takes us behind the scenes to see just how the motion-capture technology is put to the service of the film makers.So this is well worth owning, even if it does get numerous plays on various TV channels during the season and - strangely - throughout the rest of the year as well. As a bonus, the singing of the song ""God Bless Us, Every One"" by the highly overrated Andrea Bocelli is limited to the credit run at the end of the film, so you can simply avoid having to hear it at all without missing a minute of the film itself!Four stars - excellent, but just a cut below my above-declared standard in ""A Christmas Carol"" movies.",4,A Surprisingly Good Film & A Great BluRay,1290038400,"11 18, 2010",2010,3473,"['past', '40-odd', 'years', 'standard', 'filmed', 'versions', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'been', 'Alastair', 'Sim', 'version', '1951', 'standard', 'day.Based', '1983', 'unsuccessful', 'Mickey', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'was', 'prepared', 'Disney', 'once', 'again', 'screw', 'up', 'classic', 'tale', 'Disney', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'name', 'emblazoned', '3-sheets', 'added', 'sense', 'trepidation.Well', 'was', 'wrong', 'Quite', 'wrong', 'be', 'honest', 'excellent', 'version', 'Dickens', 'classic', 'tale', 'version', 'much', 'closer', 'book', 'most', 'other', 'versions', 'there', 'including', 'beloved', 'Sim', 'version', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'are', 'here', 'given', 'room', 'be', 'fantastic', 'really', 'one', 'Scrooge', 'journey', 'redemption', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'happened', 'dreams', 'rather', 'here', 'now', 'pace', 'Mr', 'Dickens', 'admonition', 'readers', 'concerning', 'veracity', 'tale', 'Carrey', 'voices', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'version', 'very', 'good', 'creating', 'unique', 'characterizations', 'really', 'delineate', 'players', 'other', 'masterful', 'portrayal', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Past', 'somehow', 'speaking', 'way', 'one', 'would', 'imagine', 'flame', 'would', 'speak', 'had', 'voice', 'do', 'so', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Present', 'also', 'good', 'larger-than-life', 'figure', 'who', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Scrooge', 'disconnected-from-humanity', 'self', 'Carrey', 'Scrooge', 'dare', 'say', 'loaded', 'subtleties', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'voice', 'characterization', 'spot', 'SO', 'much', 'closer', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'faithful', 'rendition', 'what', 'Dickens', 'penned', 'say', 'disastrous', 'performance', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', '1980', 'TV', 'version', 'tale.Credit', 'also', 'due', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'portrayal', 'Bob', 'Cratchit', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Ghost', 'Jacob', 'Marley', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'truer', 'version', 'Dickens', 'vision', 'achieved', 'film', 'combination', 'acting', 'motion', 'capture', 'animation', 'Spooky', 'VERY', 'convincing.The', 'only', 'caveat', ""'ll"", 'voice', 'movie', 'couple', 'extended', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'included', 'doubt', 'keep', 'teens', 'tweens', 'engrossed', 'film', 'Most', 'egregious', 'scene', 'where', 'Scrooge', 'chased', 'streets', 'London', 'hellish', 'C', 'oacute', 'iste', 'Bodhar', 'really', 'nothing', 'story', 'even', 'animation', 'particularly', 'good.Not', 'everyone', 'fan', 'motion-capture', 'technology', 'feel', 'film', 'well', 'bridging', 'gap', 'live-action', 'animation', 'versions', 'story', 'maybe', 'coming', 'away', 'best', 'worlds', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'crew', 'have', 'gained', 'expertise', 'use', 'technique', 'Polar', 'Express', 'dividends', 'here.The', 'extras', 'included', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'especially', 'feature', 'scenes', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'motion-capture', 'technology', 'put', 'service', 'film', 'makers.So', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'even', 'get', 'numerous', 'plays', 'various', 'TV', 'channels', 'season', 'strangely', 'rest', 'year', 'as', 'well', 'bonus', 'singing', 'song', 'God', 'Bless', 'Us', 'Every', 'One', 'highly', 'overrated', 'Andrea', 'Bocelli', 'limited', 'credit', 'run', 'end', 'film', 'can', 'simply', 'avoid', 'having', 'hear', 'missing', 'minute', 'film', 'Four', 'stars', 'excellent', 'just', 'cut', 'above-declared', 'standard', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'movies']",Disney's A Christmas Carol
1355090,A36EW68H08UOCS,B003NFM3JK,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[1, 1]","For the purposes of this review I won't bother getting into the on-going debate about ""realistic"" vs ""creepy"" in the CGI animated characters such as those here or in Zemeckis' other famed holiday film,The Polar Express (Widescreen Edition), other than to say coming out of the full theatre I heard many comments along the lines of ""HOW did they make that look so REAL? You could see every whisker... and the cracks in the leather!"" and I heard no comments along the lines of ""those characters just didn't quite look right...""This new version of Dickens' classic marries much of the original prose with the ability to do eye-popping scenes with computer-aided animation.  I waited to see the chestnuts that mark a faithful presentation, beginning with Old Ebenezer's opening interaction with nephew Fred:SCROOGE:  What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.FRED:  What right have you to be dismal? You're rich enough.Dickens' original text is rather faithfully followed, and many scenes that previously relied heavily on the audience's imagination are more than fully fleshed out.  At appropriate times Zemeckis concentrates on important details in a way a stage adaptation could not: Marley's appearance is heralded by a single bell that begins to sway to and fro, then gently clinking, then finally loudly clanging, accompanied by every bell in Scrooge's house.We know that Scrooge is guided about by the three ghosts - the Ghost of Christmas Past carries him out of London and over snow-covered countryside to the home of his youth.  The Ghost of Christmas Present gives a new take on Scrooge's looks at events taking place: the floor of Scrooge's parlor is rendered invisible and the Ghost magically moves the floor over London - to the Cratchit home, then to the party going on at Fred's.  The Spirit of Yules Yet To Come is ingeniously manifest as only a shadow, taking solid form only when the Spirit needs to point an eery black bony finger at the next ghastly site in Scrooge's future.But the filmmakers must have been intoxicated with the animated ability to zoom us back and forth.  The trips listed above are interesting and, given the spirit of the tale, appropriate.  I'll even fail to criticize the transition between ""Past"" and ""Present"", a segue that involves Scrooge mounting the cap of Christmas past - a ""hat"" that looks like a stainless steel megaphone.  The cap blasts off towards the moon like the Space Shuttle and we get to see the silhouette of Scrooge flailing across an E.T. inspired broad moon face.I cannot give a similar pass to another ""chase"" scene - Scrooge is chased halfway across the City by a ghostly hearse pulled by demonic black horses with fiery red eyes.  You remember that scene from Dickens, right?  No doubt you recall that Scrooge escapes by being magically shrunk to six inches and diving into a drain-pipe.  Mini-Scrooge is deposited into the scene where his housekeeper is rifling through his bed curtains - perhaps most distracting, six-inch Ebenezer is given a voice about three octaves above Alvin and the Chipmunk - for the LIFE of me I could scarcely understand a word he squeaked before being chased out of the room with a broom alongside a mouse.A word must be given in praise of the voice actors: Jim Carrey is frankly magnificent as not only Scrooge, but also as the various spirits.  If you're going to make a Holiday tradition of a Jim Carrey film, choose this one overDr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas (Deluxe Edition). Gary Oldman brings the male Cratchits and Jacob Marley to life.  You can feel the jolliness Bob Hoskins brought to old Fezziwig, and Colin Firth is perfect as the kind-spirited Fred.The heart and soul of A Christmas Carol involves Scrooge's transformation from lonely old skinflint to ""and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well"".  Our theatre was full of satisfied customers - but I wish Zemeckis had been slightly MORE inspired by Dickens, and slightly less by George Lucas' mantra of ""movement through the frame.""",4,"Honey, They Shrunk the Scrooge!",1259971200,"12 5, 2009",2009,4043,"['purposes', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'getting', 'on-going', 'debate', 'realistic', 'vs', 'creepy', 'CGI', 'animated', 'characters', 'such', 'here', 'Zemeckis', 'other', 'famed', 'holiday', 'film', 'Polar', 'Express', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'other', 'say', 'coming', 'full', 'theatre', 'heard', 'many', 'comments', 'lines', 'HOW', 'did', 'make', 'look', 'so', 'REAL', 'could', 'see', 'whisker', 'cracks', 'leather', 'heard', 'comments', 'lines', 'characters', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'look', 'right', 'new', 'version', 'Dickens', 'classic', 'marries', 'much', 'original', 'prose', 'ability', 'do', 'eye-popping', 'scenes', 'computer-aided', 'animation', 'waited', 'see', 'chestnuts', 'mark', 'faithful', 'presentation', 'beginning', 'Old', 'Ebenezer', 'opening', 'interaction', 'nephew', 'Fred', 'SCROOGE', 'What', 'reason', 'have', 'be', 'merry', ""'re"", 'poor', 'enough.FRED', 'What', 'right', 'have', 'be', 'dismal', ""'re"", 'rich', 'enough.Dickens', 'original', 'text', 'rather', 'faithfully', 'followed', 'many', 'scenes', 'previously', 'relied', 'heavily', 'audience', 'imagination', 'are', 'more', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'appropriate', 'times', 'Zemeckis', 'important', 'details', 'way', 'stage', 'adaptation', 'could', 'not', 'Marley', 'appearance', 'heralded', 'single', 'bell', 'sway', 'fro', 'then', 'gently', 'clinking', 'then', 'finally', 'loudly', 'clanging', 'accompanied', 'bell', 'Scrooge', 'house.We', 'know', 'Scrooge', 'guided', 'three', 'ghosts', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Past', 'London', 'snow-covered', 'countryside', 'home', 'youth', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Present', 'new', 'take', 'Scrooge', 'looks', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'floor', 'Scrooge', 'parlor', 'rendered', 'invisible', 'Ghost', 'magically', 'floor', 'London', 'Cratchit', 'home', 'then', 'party', 'going', 'Fred', 'Spirit', 'Yules', 'Yet', 'Come', 'ingeniously', 'manifest', 'only', 'shadow', 'taking', 'solid', 'form', 'only', 'when', 'Spirit', 'point', 'eery', 'black', 'bony', 'finger', 'next', 'ghastly', 'site', 'Scrooge', 'future.But', 'filmmakers', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'intoxicated', 'animated', 'ability', 'zoom', 'back', 'forth', 'trips', 'listed', 'are', 'interesting', 'given', 'spirit', 'tale', 'appropriate', ""'ll"", 'even', 'fail', 'criticize', 'transition', 'Past', 'Present', 'segue', 'Scrooge', 'mounting', 'cap', 'Christmas', 'hat', 'stainless', 'steel', 'megaphone', 'cap', 'towards', 'moon', 'Space', 'Shuttle', 'get', 'see', 'silhouette', 'Scrooge', 'flailing', 'E.T', 'inspired', 'broad', 'moon', 'face.I', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'similar', 'pass', 'chase', 'scene', 'Scrooge', 'chased', 'halfway', 'City', 'ghostly', 'hearse', 'pulled', 'demonic', 'black', 'horses', 'fiery', 'red', 'eyes', 'remember', 'scene', 'Dickens', 'right', 'No', 'doubt', 'recall', 'Scrooge', 'escapes', 'being', 'magically', 'shrunk', 'six', 'inches', 'diving', 'drain-pipe', 'Mini-Scrooge', 'deposited', 'scene', 'where', 'housekeeper', 'rifling', 'bed', 'perhaps', 'most', 'distracting', 'six-inch', 'Ebenezer', 'given', 'voice', 'three', 'octaves', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunk', 'LIFE', 'could', 'scarcely', 'understand', 'word', 'squeaked', 'being', 'chased', 'room', 'broom', 'mouse.A', 'word', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'praise', 'voice', 'actors', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'frankly', 'magnificent', 'not', 'only', 'Scrooge', 'also', 'various', 'spirits', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'Holiday', 'tradition', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'film', 'choose', 'one', 'overDr', 'Seuss', 'How', 'Grinch', 'Stole', 'Christmas', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'male', 'Cratchits', 'Jacob', 'Marley', 'life', 'can', 'feel', 'jolliness', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'brought', 'old', 'Fezziwig', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'perfect', 'kind-spirited', 'Fred.The', 'heart', 'soul', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Scrooge', 'transformation', 'lonely', 'old', 'skinflint', 'was', 'always', 'said', 'knew', 'how', 'keep', 'Christmas', 'well', 'theatre', 'was', 'full', 'satisfied', 'customers', 'wish', 'Zemeckis', 'had', 'been', 'slightly', 'MORE', 'inspired', 'Dickens', 'slightly', 'less', 'George', 'Lucas', 'mantra', 'movement', 'frame']",Disney's A Christmas Carol

1355092,A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O,B003NFM3JK,"MartinP ""MartinP""","[4, 4]","Robert Zemeckis continues with determination on the path of motion capture 3d animation, and 'A Christmas Carol' is his most successful result so far. However, I think this has more to do with the beautiful, consistent design of the film and the familiarity of Dickens's timeless ghost story than with any marked advances in the animation of virtual humans that could pass for real. The fact that the Scrooge character works quite well is due to its cartoonish look, with enormous protruding chin and nose. Other characters are firmly stuck in what the industry sometimes refers to as 'uncanny valley', that area where virtual humans are not unrealistic enough to make our imagination fill in the blanks, but are afflicted with subtle unrealities that make them look like really weird, strangely repulsive real people. Mouths and eyes in particular remain problematic. The digital versions of Colin Firth (Cousin Fred) and Gary Oldman (Bob Cratchit) that we encounter are rather startling.As an adaptation of Dickens's story for the screen, none has yet been more faithful to the original. Not only is Zemeckis textually true, but he captures the eerie atmosphere of Dickens to perfection. This is therefore a very dark, at times scary Christmas Carol, definitely not suitable for young children, I would say. On the other hand the director has allowed a few flights of fancy. The appearance of the Ghost of Christmas Past as a living candle I found quite brilliant, and the dance floor antics of Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig are bound to draw a few laughs. Other additions are less succesfull and some, such as the overdone chase of Scrooge by the Phantom Hearse, are at odds with the atmosphere of the story and apparently only there to spice up the 3d version of the film.Jim Carrey is less of a problem than I had feared, and though he voiced the ghosts as well, I didn't even recognize him there. The continuous, joyless fake laughter of the Ghost of Christmas Present I did find pretty annoying, though.Unfortunately, due to the fast pacing of the story (and time taken up by unnecessary additions, such as that chase scene I mentioned) I did feel that Scrooge's character change comes about rather abruptly, without allowing enough time for a believable thawing of his cold heart. And at the end a general sense of unpleasantness remained that I find hard to pinpoint and may have something to do with that 'uncanny valley', combined with the abundance of dark and  morbid imagery. Nonetheless, an intruguing excercise in gothic spookiness; and as a feast for the eyes this is quite recommendable; you won't ever see a more Christmassy London than you get here here.",4,"A dark, beautifully designed Christmas Carol, but the virtual humans remain scary",1289606400,"11 13, 2010",2010,2666,"['Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'determination', 'path', 'motion', 'capture', '3d', 'animation', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'most', 'successful', 'result', 'so', 'far', 'However', 'think', 'more', 'do', 'beautiful', 'consistent', 'design', 'film', 'familiarity', 'Dickens', 'timeless', 'ghost', 'story', 'marked', 'advances', 'animation', 'virtual', 'humans', 'could', 'pass', 'real', 'fact', 'Scrooge', 'character', 'quite', 'well', 'due', 'cartoonish', 'look', 'enormous', 'protruding', 'chin', 'nose', 'Other', 'characters', 'are', 'firmly', 'stuck', 'what', 'industry', 'refers', ""'uncanny"", 'valley', 'area', 'where', 'virtual', 'humans', 'are', 'not', 'unrealistic', 'enough', 'make', 'imagination', 'fill', 'blanks', 'are', 'afflicted', 'subtle', 'unrealities', 'make', 'look', 'really', 'weird', 'strangely', 'repulsive', 'real', 'people', 'Mouths', 'eyes', 'particular', 'remain', 'problematic', 'digital', 'versions', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Cousin', 'Fred', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Bob', 'Cratchit', 'encounter', 'are', 'rather', 'startling.As', 'adaptation', 'Dickens', 'story', 'screen', 'none', 'yet', 'been', 'more', 'faithful', 'original', 'Not', 'only', 'Zemeckis', 'textually', 'true', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'Dickens', 'perfection', 'therefore', 'very', 'dark', 'times', 'scary', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'definitely', 'not', 'suitable', 'young', 'children', 'would', 'say', 'other', 'hand', 'director', 'allowed', 'few', 'flights', 'fancy', 'appearance', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Past', 'living', 'candle', 'found', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'dance', 'floor', 'antics', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Fezziwig', 'are', 'bound', 'draw', 'few', 'laughs', 'Other', 'additions', 'are', 'less', 'succesfull', 'such', 'overdone', 'chase', 'Scrooge', 'Phantom', 'Hearse', 'are', 'odds', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'apparently', 'only', 'there', 'spice', 'up', '3d', 'version', 'film.Jim', 'Carrey', 'less', 'problem', 'had', 'feared', 'voiced', 'ghosts', 'as', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'there', 'continuous', 'joyless', 'fake', 'laughter', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Present', 'did', 'find', 'pretty', 'annoying', 'though.Unfortunately', 'due', 'fast', 'pacing', 'story', 'time', 'taken', 'up', 'unnecessary', 'additions', 'such', 'chase', 'scene', 'mentioned', 'did', 'feel', 'Scrooge', 'character', 'change', 'rather', 'abruptly', 'allowing', 'enough', 'time', 'believable', 'thawing', 'cold', 'heart', 'end', 'general', 'sense', 'unpleasantness', 'remained', 'find', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'may', 'have', 'something', 'do', ""'uncanny"", 'valley', 'combined', 'abundance', 'dark', 'morbid', 'imagery', 'Nonetheless', 'intruguing', 'excercise', 'gothic', 'spookiness', 'feast', 'eyes', 'quite', 'recommendable', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'see', 'more', 'Christmassy', 'London', 'get', 'here', 'here']",Disney's A Christmas Carol

For those who do not know, the story is about the redemption of a man so heartless that drastic measures have to be taken.However, the measures taken in this movie are too drastic.  It should have been rated PG-13.  In short, they destroyed the wonderful beginning.  The film had promise, but it didn't keep that promise.  I wish I had Red-Boxed it first.I give the talented voice-actors a solid 5.The animation a solid 4 - because sometimes Scrooge looked wall-eyed or cross-eyed.The script gets no stars and Disney a -6 for stamping their approval on a vastly inferior production.Below are spoilers, but a few reasons I can't give this film a better rating.Marley's lower jaw became unhitched during his famous rant and he had to manipulate it to speak.  Macabre and bizarre.  All previous versions of Marley had at least stirred some empathy from me, but not this one.  I liked his long chains and locked trunks better than him.The ghost from Christmas past was a flame-headed alien with an unpleasantly sinister voice. If you read the book, you will find the ghost looked human - most of the time, not like a wandering candle.  This was never my favorite ghost, but at least the ghost showed more human qualities in the other productions.The second is usually my favorite ghost.  What isn't to love?  He looks like and laughs like Father Christmas.  However, in this version, the ghost has a heart-attack, complete with gripping his chest and moaning in pain.  He turns chalk-white and dies in front of Scrooge - disintegrating into a laughing skeleton while the twins of ignorance and want become, respectively, a criminal and a screaming lunatic (literally).The last ghost, the one that everyone should expect to be creepy, finally fits the bill and they did a great job with him.  BUT they added a long drawn-out chase scene involving red-eyed horses that chase an ever shrinking-in-size Scrooge who then speaks like someone that's been sucking helium.  Here, the film became a confusing collage of Sleepy Hollow and Darby O' Gill meet Scrooge!At the end, where Scrooge is cavorting around, lightened of his decades-old burden of acknowledging the miracle he's been given, the cleaning woman freaks out and swears.  It wasn't needed and it wasn't funny.  There were no warm fuzzy feelings for me at the end.  I did not rejoice for Scrooge because it fell far short of my expectations.

As far as the film itself I thought it was a good update on a classic story. While I don't consider myself an aficionado, I do know the story well and found it stayed true enough to it. The warmth and humanity of the characters is definitely still present. Then of course there is the 3D aspect, which completely blew me away. I've seen most of the 3D releases in the last year or so, and with the exception of Avatar this movie did the best job of utilizing it.

I will add this to the list of the versions I will watch again and again.The story stuck very closely to the book, using the same dialogue in most cases.  Nothing is lost in the story.  The characters were designed as they described in the book, which is not often the case.  The details in the homes, offices and in the city were magnificent.  It was almost like getting a history lesson in the bargain.  The movie did not hesitate to include the hunger and starvation that were a part of London in the mid-19th century.  There was a bit of comedy but it is not really a comedic book so it was kept to a minimum.  A few details were added to accommodate the 3-D but they fit in well with the movie.  Nothing vital was taken out and nothing unnecessary was addedThe animation was wonderful.  The details were minute, even down the wind-chaffed red cheeks and noses of the Londoners.  At one point I could see the pores on Scrooge's nose.  I saw this movie in 3-D and I highly recommend it.  I see this as the future of movies, the effect was fantastic.

The third ghost is no gentler than the other two, but louder and uglier.Even though the movie was overthought, it limited its appeal to mature adults with its lecturing style of resurrecting the past, re-learning the missed lessons, and being harassed violently, even with death, for the sake of cheering up.The anger the viewer would develop towards the gloomy mind of the old man might last longer and stay deeper within the subconscious than the cheer up that resulted from the constant torture by ghosts.Disney's ingenious visual resurrection of the historical beauty of the past rendered the movie attractive, from the beginning to the end. Reliving the past through digital art might be of greater benefit to the viewer than the endless chase of an old man with a madly horsed wagon, darting through dark and snowy allies.I was more fascinated with visualizing the past places, people, and their way of living than following the scenario of beating up on Uncle Scrooge to change his gloomy views on life.",5,"Disney's ingenious display of the past, outplays the beating up lesson of Uncle Scrooge.",1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,1413,"['Beating', 'up', 'old', 'man', 'misery', 'order', 'cheer', 'up', 'viewers', 'transformation', 'might', 'not', 'appeal', 'many', 'segments', 'society', 'Kids', 'must', 'be', 'excluded', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'grotesquely', 'chained', 'ghost', 'Even', 'ghost', 'past', 'though', 'delightful', 'would', 'still', 'frighten', 'child', 'not', 'only', 'menacing', 'manipulation', 'feeble', 'old', 'man', 'also', 'fast', 'unrestricted', 'travel', 'third', 'ghost', 'gentler', 'other', 'two', 'louder', 'uglier.Even', 'movie', 'was', 'overthought', 'limited', 'appeal', 'mature', 'adults', 'lecturing', 'style', 'resurrecting', 'past', 're-learning', 'missed', 'lessons', 'being', 'harassed', 'violently', 'even', 'death', 'sake', 'cheering', 'up.The', 'anger', 'viewer', 'would', 'develop', 'gloomy', 'mind', 'old', 'man', 'might', 'last', 'longer', 'stay', 'deeper', 'subconscious', 'cheer', 'up', 'resulted', 'constant', 'torture', 'ghosts.Disney', 'ingenious', 'visual', 'resurrection', 'historical', 'beauty', 'past', 'rendered', 'movie', 'attractive', 'beginning', 'end', 'Reliving', 'past', 'digital', 'art', 'might', 'be', 'greater', 'benefit', 'viewer', 'endless', 'chase', 'old', 'man', 'madly', 'horsed', 'wagon', 'darting', 'dark', 'snowy', 'allies.I', 'was', 'more', 'fascinated', 'visualizing', 'past', 'places', 'people', 'way', 'living', 'following', 'scenario', 'beating', 'up', 'Uncle', 'Scrooge', 'change', 'gloomy', 'views', 'life']",Disney's A Christmas Carol

Were there spins to this tale that brought us to a better understanding of it while still remaining faithful to the story?For me, the answer was no.  This fully CGI tale, like the aliens inAvatar (Original Theatrical Edition)and Gollum inThe Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Special Extended Edition), featured characters based off actors being scanned by computers and then filling in the images later.While this was a different interpretation of the story, I felt that Zemeckis fell a little too in love with the technology and lost focus on what matters--the story.  With a lot of swooping camera shots and a head-scratching action sequence involving a miniaturized Scrooge, this was turned into empty spectacle, not to mention I found it a little creepy seeing Gary Oldman's face on Bob Cratchit's body.  As for the story itself, I found Scrooge's transformation forced, a product more because the makers wanting it to happen rather than arising naturally from the character.While this version may appeal to children or anyone who hasn't seen one of the umpteen other versions of this story, it probably won't work for those us who have seen it before.

1355109,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B003NFM3JK,Muzzlehatch,"[3, 3]","Director Robert Zemeckis continues in his fascination with motion capture, delivering both his best-looking and most successful example to date with this umpteenth version of Charles Dickens' 1843 novella.  The technology allows for two major achievements: a spectacular and colorful recreation of early Victorian London with many long takes, swoops and crane shots that are to my eyes more reminiscent of early Disney features in their smoothness and eye for detail than most modern animations; and the playing of multiple roles (all three Ghosts and all ages of Ebenezer Scrooge) by star Jim Carrey and several other cast members.Not being previously an enormous fan of Carrey, nor of the direction Zemeckis has gone in the past couple of decades (though I remain a huge fan of the BACK TO THE FUTURE films and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT), I can't say that I had the highest of hopes for this, but on the whole both the film and Carrey won me over.  Despite the immense cost and the technological innovation of the thing, this is at heart a fairly conservative and faithful adaptation; little of Dickens' dialogue is changed and all the essentials of the story are kept though, as with every film version I've seen, some segments are shortened and others more drawn out.  The sequence with the Ghost of Christmas Present is kept mostly to focusing on Bob Cratchit and Scrooge's nephew; the following scenes stretch out the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come for a nightmarish chase sequence that for me was the weakest part of the film.  Few concessions are made to the youngest audiences, who probably won't understand a fair amount of what's going on at all times and will be focusing instead on the eye candy filling the screen, of which there is plenty - makeshift toboggan rides down the street, complex multi-layered screen compositions in the ""Christmas Present"" sequence, the multitude of ghosts floating outside of Scrooge's window, a shrunken Scrooge being chased like a rat in the ""Yet to Come"" scene, etc.  The photography is spectacular, the colors vibrant, the feeling if not Dickensian then at least...different.But ultimately any Christmas Carol rises or falls on the strength of its Scrooge, and Carrey for the most part doesn't disappoint.  He's as nasty and venal in the early scenes as any Scrooge on record, but this film takes more care than many to show just how organic his development from lonely boy to aspiring businessman to bitter recluse has been.  He makes you frustrated, that a man so abused himself, and who has made so many mistakes, can continue down this dark path; a humanized yet nonetheless frightening and truly unpleasant venality.  And his transformation is fairly believable, though I think if more time had been spent with the second ghost, and less on the silly chase with the third it might have been even more cathartic.  The only real problem with him is that at the end he channels the 1951 performance of Alastair Sim - still the best known of all Scrooges - a little too closely I think.  All in all, fine work though, with his plasticine features and serviceable British accent finishing the characterization nicely.  Bob Hoskins and Gary Oldman do fine in multiple roles as well, really there is nothing for me to complain about in terms of the casting.Zemeckis (who also wrote the screenplay) definitely highlights the spiritual themes of the story; there's a striking sequence where the camera pans over a church with the cross very blatantly foregrounded, and the soundtrack choices included several specifically Christian carols.  He doesn't, though, rub the audiences' noses in the religious elements, and this Christmas Carol, is, as it should be, a mix of dark pessimism at the nature of capitalism and greed, mixed with an optimism that man, even a man as desperately hollow and spiritually poor as Scrooge, really does have the capacity to change, and that goodwill towards his fellow man is the real path to salvation - on earth or in whatever heaven one wants to believe in.For me the Brian Desmond Hurst-directed 1951 film with Alastair Sim remains the benchmark for this story, but it's no shame to fall in the shadow of that film, and Zemeckis and Carrey's work, clearly a labor of love just as much as commerce, will take it's place as a classic too, I suspect.",4,"A spectacular and wild ride for Scrooge, but never losing track of the basics",1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,4341,"['Director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'fascination', 'motion', 'capture', 'delivering', 'best-looking', 'most', 'successful', 'example', 'date', 'umpteenth', 'version', 'Charles', 'Dickens', '1843', 'novella', 'technology', 'two', 'major', 'achievements', 'spectacular', 'colorful', 'recreation', 'early', 'Victorian', 'London', 'many', 'long', 'swoops', 'crane', 'shots', 'are', 'eyes', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'early', 'Disney', 'features', 'smoothness', 'eye', 'detail', 'most', 'modern', 'animations', 'playing', 'multiple', 'roles', 'three', 'Ghosts', 'ages', 'Ebenezer', 'Scrooge', 'star', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'several', 'other', 'cast', 'members.Not', 'being', 'previously', 'enormous', 'fan', 'Carrey', 'direction', 'Zemeckis', 'gone', 'past', 'couple', 'decades', 'remain', 'huge', 'fan', 'BACK', 'TO', 'THE', 'FUTURE', 'films', 'WHO', 'FRAMED', 'ROGER', 'RABBIT', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'had', 'highest', 'hopes', 'whole', 'film', 'Carrey', 'won', 'over', 'immense', 'cost', 'technological', 'innovation', 'thing', 'heart', 'fairly', 'conservative', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'little', 'Dickens', 'dialogue', 'changed', 'essentials', 'story', 'are', 'kept', 'though', 'film', 'version', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'segments', 'are', 'shortened', 'others', 'more', 'drawn', 'out', 'sequence', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Present', 'kept', 'mostly', 'focusing', 'Bob', 'Cratchit', 'Scrooge', 'nephew', 'following', 'scenes', 'stretch', 'out', 'presence', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Yet', 'Come', 'nightmarish', 'chase', 'sequence', 'was', 'weakest', 'part', 'film', 'Few', 'concessions', 'are', 'made', 'youngest', 'audiences', 'who', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'fair', 'amount', 'what', 'going', 'times', 'will', 'be', 'focusing', 'instead', 'eye', 'candy', 'filling', 'screen', 'plenty', 'makeshift', 'toboggan', 'street', 'complex', 'multi-layered', 'screen', 'compositions', 'Christmas', 'Present', 'sequence', 'multitude', 'ghosts', 'floating', 'Scrooge', 'window', 'shrunken', 'Scrooge', 'being', 'chased', 'rat', 'Yet', 'Come', 'scene', 'etc', 'photography', 'spectacular', 'colors', 'vibrant', 'feeling', 'not', 'Dickensian', 'then', 'least', 'ultimately', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'strength', 'Scrooge', 'Carrey', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'nasty', 'venal', 'early', 'scenes', 'Scrooge', 'record', 'film', 'more', 'care', 'many', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'organic', 'development', 'lonely', 'boy', 'aspiring', 'businessman', 'bitter', 'recluse', 'been', 'frustrated', 'man', 'so', 'abused', 'who', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'mistakes', 'can', 'continue', 'down', 'dark', 'path', 'humanized', 'yet', 'nonetheless', 'frightening', 'truly', 'unpleasant', 'venality', 'transformation', 'fairly', 'believable', 'think', 'more', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'spent', 'second', 'ghost', 'less', 'silly', 'chase', 'third', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'cathartic', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'end', '1951', 'performance', 'Alastair', 'Sim', 'still', 'best', 'known', 'Scrooges', 'little', 'too', 'closely', 'think', 'fine', 'work', 'plasticine', 'features', 'serviceable', 'British', 'accent', 'finishing', 'characterization', 'nicely', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'do', 'fine', 'multiple', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'nothing', 'complain', 'terms', 'casting.Zemeckis', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'definitely', 'spiritual', 'themes', 'story', 'striking', 'sequence', 'where', 'camera', 'over', 'church', 'cross', 'very', 'blatantly', 'foregrounded', 'soundtrack', 'choices', 'included', 'several', 'specifically', 'Christian', 'carols', ""n't"", 'though', 'rub', 'audiences', 'noses', 'religious', 'elements', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'should', 'be', 'mix', 'dark', 'pessimism', 'nature', 'capitalism', 'greed', 'mixed', 'optimism', 'man', 'even', 'man', 'desperately', 'hollow', 'spiritually', 'poor', 'Scrooge', 'really', 'have', 'capacity', 'change', 'goodwill', 'fellow', 'man', 'real', 'path', 'salvation', 'earth', 'heaven', 'one', 'believe', 'in.For', 'Brian', 'Desmond', 'Hurst-directed', '1951', 'film', 'Alastair', 'Sim', 'benchmark', 'story', 'shame', 'fall', 'shadow', 'film', 'Zemeckis', 'Carrey', 'work', 'clearly', 'labor', 'love', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'commerce', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'classic', 'too', 'suspect']",Disney's A Christmas Carol

Doyle ""film buff""","[1, 2]","From an artistic viewpoint, the new Robert Zemeckis film from the man who gave us THE POLAR EXPRESS, is another of his animated features using the motion picture capture technique that allows the actors to play several roles--and the cinematography is exceptionally well done.JIM CARREY, as miserly Ebenizer Scrooge, looks nothing like his real self. He's a perfect Scrooge, using his voice and mannerisms to great effect, never overplaying the role as you might expect he would.The visit from three spirits is more frightening than usual, since Zemeckis decided to throw everything he could into startling special effects--sometimes with very gruesome results. The sight of Marley's Ghost with a flapping jaw that has to be realigned by Marley is just one of the ""extra"" touches. Some of the ""spirit"" scenes are too intense for small children and more likely to frighten them than anything else.There are times when the story remains very faithful to the Dickens book, sometimes even word for word. But when Zemeckis decides to show off what the camera can do with flying aerial scenes zooming over Victorian London, it begins to stray a bit. Biggest stray is a chase scene that has a miniature Scrooge going through drain pipes to escape an oncoming coach and horses trying to run him down.The lovely score by Alan Silvestri blends perfectly with the on screen action and includes a number of traditional Christmas favorites. GARY OLDMAN and COLIN FIRTH do well in key supporting roles but it's really Carey's show all the way. He plays several main characters with great skill.Not quite as festive as you might expect, it's a darker version of Scrooge, handsomely executed so that many of the scenes look like Victorian illustrations from the novel.Warning: This is not a child's version of the tale. Parents should be advised that some of the content is too gruesome for young kids.

The music is good, the animation is spot-on, the dialog is perfect, and the action is engaging.  The special effects are probably the movie's  highlight, but they serve the movie, allowing the film's story to be told in new ways, and do not distract from either the plot or the dialog.  And like Tom Hanks in Polar Express, Jim Carrey plays multiple characters in this movie, including the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future.  It is his acting in these scenes that show him at his best.

I had high expectations with Jim Carrey performing Scrooge and the ghosts and I am very happy to say, I was not disappointed.  I won't clutter this review with much detail about the story, afterall, we all know it.The look of the movie in 3D is absolutely wonderful.  3D is either a success or a disappointment and in this film it's a success in my opinion.  It looks amazing, it's not just some doctored scenes with items pointing out at you...it's a full environmental experience.  The movie in its entirety is visually stunning.The story is very well told, it starts just as the book begins with Scrooge signing Marley's death certificate and unlike many renditions there is no narration through out..the story unfolds before your eyes and is told through the characters.  Jim Carrey is wonderful as the ghosts and Scrooge, in some instances I wouldn't even have realized it was his voice if I hadn't already known it.  Gary Oldman voices Bob Cratchit, that was a nice surprise.The ghosts travels with Scrooge were the best that I've seen and the most visually stunning, they do have an advantage with it not being live action and this also adds an appeal for younger children, making this rendition fit for the entire family. This story really is about hope and change and the ""magic"" of Christmas.  Robert Zemekis did a wonderful job here and he definately deserves a nod for understanding what this story is about.Also one more note: we got to see a 3D preview of the new movie Avatar and three other upcoming films, so make sure you arrive early, there are several previews in 3D that are exciting to see as well, so don't miss them waiting in line for popcorn.This film is a great way to start your holiday season.

And in addition, there is certainly plenty of fun and frolicking within the film to add the Christmas spirit to one's holiday film viewing, and one scene in particular is where the Ghost of Christmas Past takes Scrooge back to revisit one of the most jubilant periods in his life where jolly old Mr. Fezziwig hosts the Christmas ball filled with music, laughter, and dancing.

That being said it definitely not a children's movie but it was a wonderful mature version of a classic. While another review , who claims to be a "" Christmas Story "" aficionado really cuts the movie as a one star movie. They themselves even admit that the dialog is inline with the writing in the book. But I myself loved the visual adaptation and enjoyed the introduction of new visual aspects of the movie. I did not see the 3d version of the movie, I'm not really into the 3d yet, but I can see how a lot of what was added to the movie would have been awesome in 3d.

And if you take the time to view the extras on the DVD you may actually come to appreciate more just how  Robert Zemeckis (Director) did an amazing adaptation of this story.

1355134,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B003NFM3JK,Richard Masloski,"[3, 3]","There are a number of sequences in this version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL that owe everything to Disney and naught to Dickens. These scenes occur most especially during the meeting with the Ghost of Christmas Future wherein Scrooge turns into the Incredible Shrinking Man for no apparent reason and thereby becomes, for all intents and purposes, nothing but a cartoon character. The way too-long chase by the ghostly coach and demonic horses is another excessive instance, reminiscent of Disney's Headless Horseman chasing Ichabod Crane. Another underwhelming because it is too overwhelming moment is where Scrooge rides the cone of the Ghost of Christmas Past like a rocket to the moon. These scenes come near to destroying the meaning and the message of Dickens' ""Ghost Story of Christmas."" Near - but thankfully not near enough.Of course, the reason for these Disneyisms is clear: the makers of this version need to keep the attention of child viewers alert and action-happy. If I'd previewed these moments only I would have bet the entire movie was nothing but idiotic action.  Gladly it is NOT - and what remains is something quite fine and mostly faithful to its source material.This is a very artistic film, rich in period detail, by turns intimate (such as the scenes spent with the Cratchit family) and panoramic (as in the flights through the streets of London and through Time and Space).  It is absolutely incredible how vocal and bodily performances by actual actors can be transmuted by the magic of computers into, well, a living cartoon without its actually being a cartoon.  The idea of motion capture goes back to Max Fleischer who patented the idea of the Rotoscope in order to simplify the process of animating movement by tracing frames of live action film. Fleischer utilized this process in the SUPERMAN cartoons of the early forties - and in the full-length cartoon of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS.  Technology has since then made a quantum leap with computerized motion capture - and the results are awesome and evocative.This is an age of excess and over-the-topness in current films.  Like kids playing with new toys, many of our filmmakers don't know when to stop with the thrills of computer wizardry. This movie literally dies when it is trying too-hard to be most lively. Luckily, one can be an editor by way of fast forwarding through the inanities! Also luckily, the pluses of Disney's A CHRISTMAS CAROL outweigh the negatives.  This is a version of the classic tale that the entire family can enjoy.  The Ghosts are, yes, scary - but by keeping so much of the original dialog and main themes of the original novel this is a version that can be both entertaining and educational to anyone - children of all ages! - not familiar with Dickens' actual tale.  Recommended - if only to see Scrooge take the coins off the dead Marley's eyes lest they be sealed in the coffin and thereby wasted according to Scrooge's rapacious worldview.Merry Day-after-Christmas - and God Bless Us, everyone!",4,THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING SCROOGE,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,3004,"['are', 'number', 'sequences', 'version', 'A', 'CHRISTMAS', 'CAROL', 'owe', 'everything', 'Disney', 'naught', 'Dickens', 'scenes', 'occur', 'most', 'especially', 'meeting', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Future', 'Scrooge', 'Incredible', 'Shrinking', 'Man', 'apparent', 'reason', 'thereby', 'becomes', 'intents', 'purposes', 'nothing', 'cartoon', 'character', 'way', 'too-long', 'chase', 'ghostly', 'coach', 'demonic', 'horses', 'excessive', 'instance', 'reminiscent', 'Disney', 'Headless', 'Horseman', 'chasing', 'Ichabod', 'Crane', 'underwhelming', 'too', 'overwhelming', 'moment', 'where', 'Scrooge', 'cone', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Past', 'rocket', 'moon', 'scenes', 'come', 'destroying', 'meaning', 'message', 'Dickens', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'Christmas', 'thankfully', 'not', 'enough.Of', 'course', 'reason', 'Disneyisms', 'clear', 'makers', 'version', 'need', 'keep', 'attention', 'child', 'viewers', 'alert', 'action-happy', ""'d"", 'previewed', 'moments', 'only', 'would', 'have', 'bet', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'idiotic', 'action', 'Gladly', 'NOT', 'what', 'something', 'quite', 'fine', 'mostly', 'faithful', 'source', 'material.This', 'very', 'artistic', 'film', 'rich', 'period', 'detail', 'turns', 'intimate', 'such', 'scenes', 'spent', 'Cratchit', 'family', 'panoramic', 'flights', 'streets', 'London', 'Time', 'Space', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'how', 'vocal', 'bodily', 'performances', 'actual', 'actors', 'can', 'be', 'transmuted', 'magic', 'computers', 'well', 'living', 'cartoon', 'actually', 'being', 'cartoon', 'idea', 'motion', 'capture', 'back', 'Max', 'Fleischer', 'who', 'patented', 'idea', 'Rotoscope', 'order', 'simplify', 'process', 'animating', 'movement', 'tracing', 'frames', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'utilized', 'process', 'SUPERMAN', 'cartoons', 'early', 'forties', 'full-length', 'cartoon', 'GULLIVER', 'TRAVELS', 'Technology', 'then', 'made', 'quantum', 'leap', 'computerized', 'motion', 'capture', 'results', 'are', 'awesome', 'evocative.This', 'age', 'excess', 'over-the-topness', 'current', 'films', 'kids', 'playing', 'new', 'toys', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'stop', 'thrills', 'computer', 'wizardry', 'movie', 'literally', 'when', 'trying', 'too-hard', 'be', 'most', 'lively', 'Luckily', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'editor', 'way', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'inanities', 'Also', 'luckily', 'pluses', 'Disney', 'A', 'CHRISTMAS', 'CAROL', 'outweigh', 'negatives', 'version', 'classic', 'tale', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Ghosts', 'are', 'yes', 'scary', 'keeping', 'so', 'much', 'original', 'dialog', 'main', 'themes', 'original', 'novel', 'version', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'educational', 'anyone', 'children', 'ages', 'not', 'familiar', 'Dickens', 'actual', 'tale', 'Recommended', 'only', 'see', 'Scrooge', 'take', 'coins', 'dead', 'Marley', 'eyes', 'be', 'sealed', 'coffin', 'thereby', 'wasted', 'according', 'Scrooge', 'rapacious', 'worldview.Merry', 'Day-after-Christmas', 'God', 'Bless', 'Us', 'everyone']",Disney's A Christmas Carol

Kyle,"[3, 4]","A stooped and crooked curmudgeon walks the streets of Olde London Towne, scaring off beggars, bedraggled but merry carolers, the well-meaning businessmen trying to provide a bit of charity, and in general, anyone who dares to make merry in his presence, including his nephew Fred (voice by Colin Firth).  That old man is Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) the sole remaining partner of the countinghouse of Scrooge and Marley. And, it's Christmas Eve, the seventh anniversary of Marley's death.Having decried his faithful clark, Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman) for 'robbing him' when he wants the entire day of Christmas off, Scrooge limps his way home to a solitary dinner. Little does he know his former partner, Jacob Marley (voiced by Gary Oldman) is coming in spirit to visit him and offer him one last chance at redemption.  Three ghosts will visit him this Christmas Eve night--if he doesn't accept them, he could end up with a fate as bad as Marley's.""Christmas Carol"" is for the most part faithful to the Dickensian classic.  Robert Zemeckis has, of course, added some heart-breaking and fearsome twists to the three manifestations of Christmasses Past, Present and Future. He's also given Scrooge almost the face I envisioned when I first read the story many years ago.  He's a hawk-nosed, hard eyed, bitter pill of an old man who looks like he's 'stewed in his own bitter pudding' for many years. Carrey's performance is spot-on with just the right hints of humor to keep the film from getting too bleak. London is lovingly rendered in white show and industrial ash, a mix of prosperity and poverty of which Charles Dickens would have recognized and approved as a landscape for his story.  The feel of the place is so real I wanted a bowl of hot soup to warm me after.  The final glory and benediction was Andreas Boccelli singing ""God Bless us Everyone.""This film's going to be a classic for years to come. I'm definitely purchasing the Blu Ray as soon as the disk becomes available.  One caution:  though this film is by Disney, it is not for very young children.

1355137,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B003NFM3JK,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","This new version of Dickens immortal classic ""A Christmas Carol"",released in Nov/09,tries to breathe new life into a venerable old tale,but unfortunately it misses the mark,sorry to say.Jim Carrey of course is the driving force/voices behind Scrooge and most of the ghosts that visit Scrooge and they have been made to facially resemble Carrey very closely.This is Zemeckis and company trying desperately to do another Polar Express,the one in which Tom Hanks did most of the voices and characters;if only this movie had had the magic that one did.Scrooge here is just a thin,withered version of Carrey.The Ghost of Christmas Past has a candle flame for a head but the face though nondescript,is still faintly Jim's,along with his unmistakable voice in an Irish brogue.The ghost of Christmas present is a huge barrel chested version of Carrey.The facial expressions of all the characters here,like many of the better animated films of recent years(Shrek for instance),are made to match the emotional moments of their particular scene,making them seem all that more real,which in turn heightens the punch.I needn't go into the story line too much.It's the tale of Scrooge a miserly and miserable old business man who does not make merry at Christmas and despises those who do.One night he is visited by his dead partner who is there to give him a reality check and help him to straighten up and fly right before it's too late.Three visitations by spirits finally turn Scrooge around and he becomes the better human being as a result.Director Zemeckis has used a deft touch here,following much of the original book but also trying to carve out his own little Christmas Carol niche for himself.He includes some different angles to the story like the long chase sequence with the red eyed horses and his shrinking down to Lilliputian size of Scrooge as his housekeeper sells his bed curtains and he has a tussle with a cat.I found this new stuff really detracts from the main story,as if used as an excuse to lengthen/pad the movie.I might add that I first viewed this movie in the theater in 3-D.I am so glad that the story and production values work at least as well NOT in 3-D,and were not sacrificed at the expense of hyping a new/old gimmick.The digitally mastered picture here is beautifully crisp and clear and the breathtaking detail is phenomenal.The film is in its original a/r of 2:40:1 and this single one sided disc edition comes in a keepcase.Special features include:a look at the filming and make up process by one of its stars,a look at the making of the film and its retelling,and deleted scenes.All in all director Zemeckis has tried and failed to do for Carrey what he did for Hanks in Polar Express.The Christmas Carol is a much beloved tale and it will continue to be so in years ahead.But there has been just too much added on in this film and it falters quite fast.Recommended...just.",3,Zemeckis tries to do another Polar Express and fails!,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,2904,"['new', 'version', 'Dickens', 'immortal', 'classic', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol',

There are alot of familiar dialogue to this well story known to all in civilization, but there are also many adjustments for the 3D generation in regards to action and fantasy. Alot of action sequences have absolutely nothing to do with the true story of Ebenezer calamity in adjusting to his new found life as a mortal redeemed in spirit by three wise ghosts who challange him not to change in light of what they have shown him. The overabundance of laughter from the ghost of Christmas present establishes the fact that only Jim Carrey could have pulled that one off without sounding tired of laughing at the end of it.The visual trickery of floating in the room's feast peering outward below to the world as if inside a giant balloon is very effective, and a neat little gimmick, accompanied by familiar Christmas anthem.The only trouble I had with taking Mr. Scrooge seriously as a changed man was I had a feeling he was simply an old crone who was out saving his skin from damnation, and not entirely enthused or having overcome his stupid notions of what life had become to mean to him.In prior roles, for example, I have seen Scrooge actually look repentant, not only to save his skin, but actually wanting to become apart of civilization of which he thought he lost, and was once beside himself to regain it, and for whatever reason he could think of to do it. The ghosts themselves presented him with life of yesterday he had hold dear, the times of today with which he is apart of, and the sights of tomorrow of which he still has some control of if he decides to change his ways.It is these ingrediants that overcome his cold spirit in a matter of a few hours, but the Scrooge presented here doesnt seem to change until he becomes frighted out of his bleak skull by falling from the heavens down to earth by himself, or grasping at the edges of his rocking tombstone eventually falling once again into the bowls of hell. These are the things that have changed this particular Scrooge, not because he has reattached his soul for the better, but rather to find a way to avoid unpleasant results by finding a way to behave from the bitter soul he once was. Never does he shed a tear, of which Scrooge most certainly did so before he became a changed man to the world. And for all the fantastic 3D visuals, this Scrooge remains cold, even in the final sequence.And the three ghosts are the most forgettable ghosts to date, even with the elaborate effects.

1355142,A2FU3HUKK4PFM8,B003NFM3JK,Roger Farnham,"[97, 145]","I can say without reservation that this is the worst version the Carol that I have ever seen.I am somewhat of an aficionado of the Carol so I really looked forward to Disney's release.  I went to the first showing of the first day of release (November 6,2009)and settled down to enjoy myself.I had really hoped that Robert Zemeckis would work his magic but, unfortunately, like most adapters of the Carol he felt the need to ""improve"" it.  What he ended up doing was somehow removing most of the warmth and humanity from Dickens' well-loved story.I will admit that Mr. Zemeckis uses much of the original dialogue from the book throughout this movie but most of the action is heavily modified or totally new, and is, to anyone who is familiar with the book, intrusive and irritating.  For example, in the book the door knocker changes into Marley's face and then disappears.  Here it not only appears but also screams in Scrooge's face causing him to fall down the front steps.  When Marley enters the room he doesn't just enter the room, he throws several of the heavy boxes he is chained to through the door first.When the ghost of Christmas Past appears he looks like a candle and his head is, in fact, a candle flame floating above his body.  At the end of this session Scrooge jams the candle-snuffer over the ghost's head just as in the book.  Unlike the book he holds on to the snuffer and it suddenly blasts off like a rocket taking him high into the sky, then disintegrating and leaving him flying.  He sails past the face of the moon in a scene reminiscent of E.T.s famous scene then falls seemingly miles toward the ground before waking up on the floor beside his bed.  The whole segment is gratuitous and, quite frankly, childish.When the Ghost of Christmas Present appears the ceiling in Scrooge's room is suddenly about 50 feet high.  The Ghost looks exactly like Jim Carrey with the beard and his expressions are the same smirking expressions that Carrey usually displays making the Ghost, at least to me, very unpleasant.  One of the things that made this segment so important in the book was that the Ghost took Scrooge around London and let him mingle with the people (albeit invisibly) to get a feel of the holiday spirit.  Here, the Ghost apparently lifts the upper story from Scrooge's house and they fly around the city in it.  Part of the floor becomes transparent and Scrooge observes everything as if on a television screen.  Yes, he sees what's going on but, he does not mingle and there is no feeling of his gaining humanity.  At the end of this segment the Ghost says that he only lives for one season and abruptly ages, dies (while still laughing Ho, Ho, Ho) rots and turns into a skeleton, then disintegrates into dust and blows away.The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come segment is, quite frankly, very frightening.  Unlike most versions of the Carol the Ghost is mostly shown only in the shadow and becomes solid only rarely.  There is a long segment which I found to be not only frightening to a younger child but totally outside the spirit of the book, gratuitous, and frankly stupid.  The Phantom Hearse, mentioned only briefly in the book, chases a terrified Scrooge for what seems like miles.  For some unexplained reason Scrooge suddenly shrinks until he is smaller than a mouse, he slides along a rooftop smashing into icicles, then falls off the roof and lands in the bag of the charwoman, Mrs. Dilber, who is taking Scrooge's belongings to sell.  Scrooge witnesses her total lack of feeling for him and is aghast at how easily she stole things from him, still not realizing that in this future he is dead.In the graveyard scene Scrooge, who is now again full size, is understandably terrified and, as in several other versions, he falls into his own open grave and he, and the audience, realizes that it ends in Hell.  He is, of course, saved and reformed in the end but the feeling is not that he was reformed so much because of what he learned as that he is frightened into it.Throughout the movie Scrooge is thrown, launched, battered and generally physically abused for no apparent purpose and with no apparent damage.  The ghosts, up to and including Marley, do not seem to be the friendly, helpful and caring spirits of the book but seem, instead, to be enjoying making Scrooge suffer rather than helping him to learn.  Overall I found the movie to be cold, depressing and one of the least satisfying versions of A Christmas Carol that I have ever seen.  I own more than 20 different versions of this story on tape and DVD.

1355143,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B003NFM3JK,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 4]","With income-disparity at a level not seen since the turn of the last century, Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" has never seemed more timely and relevant in its spirit and message.  No longer just a quaint little tale from a distant past, the story, with its themes of unbridled greed and compassion for the poor, speaks with a renewed urgency to our current generation.So, polemics aside, how does the 2009 ""motion-capture"" animated version of this most famous of all stories stack up against the umpteen others we've seen over the course of a lifetime (including those featuring The Muppets and Mr Magoo)?  Very well, actually.  Robert Zemechis' movie remains generally faithful to the source material, and, while it provides us with a visually ravishing - almost snow globe-like - look at a wintry 19th Century London, it isn't afraid to confront the darker elements of the tale as well (as such, it might be a bit frightening for very young kids at times).  And while one could accuse it of going a trifle overboard in its search for the requisite 3-D sensation (as most of these films by their very nature are wont to do), the movie remains forever focused on the human heart that beats at the core of the work.Even in semi-animated form, Jim Carrey is so remarkable as the miser Scrooge (and the three main ghosts who visit him) that, in the spirit of the holidays, we're even willing to forgive him for his desecration of the Grinch a decade or so back.  And he's backed by a first-class cast that includes Robin Wright Penn, Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Bob Hoskins, and Cary Elwes among others.All minor quibbles and qualms aside, you'd have to be a bah-humbugging Scrooge yourself to resist the charms of this movie.",4,A classy treatment of a classic,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,1726,"['income-disparity', 'level', 'not', 'seen', 'turn', 'last', 'century', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'never', 'seemed', 'more', 'timely', 'relevant', 'spirit', 'message', 'No', 'longer', 'just', 'quaint', 'little', 'tale', 'distant', 'past', 'story', 'themes', 'unbridled', 'greed', 'compassion', 'poor', 'renewed', 'urgency', 'current', 'generation.So', 'polemics', 'aside', 'how', '2009', 'motion-capture', 'animated', 'version', 'most', 'famous', 'stories', 'stack', 'up', 'umpteen', 'others', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'course', 'lifetime', 'including', 'featuring', 'Muppets', 'Mr', 'Magoo', 'Very', 'well', 'actually', 'Robert', 'Zemechis', 'movie', 'generally', 'faithful', 'source', 'material', 'visually', 'ravishing', 'almost', 'snow', 'globe-like', 'look', 'wintry', '19th', 'Century', 'London', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'confront', 'darker', 'elements', 'tale', 'well', 'such', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'frightening', 'very', 'young', 'kids', 'times', 'one', 'could', 'accuse', 'going', 'trifle', 'overboard', 'search', 'requisite', '3-D', 'sensation', 'most', 'films', 'very', 'nature', 'are', 'wont', 'do', 'movie', 'forever', 'focused', 'human', 'heart', 'core', 'work.Even', 'semi-animated', 'form', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'so', 'remarkable', 'miser', 'Scrooge', 'three', 'main', 'ghosts', 'who', 'visit', 'spirit', 'holidays', ""'re"", 'even', 'willing', 'forgive', 'desecration', 'Grinch', 'decade', 'so', 'back', 'backed', 'first-class', 'cast', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'others.All', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'qualms', 'aside', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'bah-humbugging', 'Scrooge', 'resist', 'charms', 'movie']",Disney's A Christmas Carol

Having experienced that along with Zemeckis' previous two CGI gems (The Polar Express and Beowulf), my wife and I were understandably excited about this.  After watching the film last night in IMAX 3-D, our opinions dropped harder than a rock in my broth.  Here is the dichotomy:Jim Carrey as Scrooge... Ok, I'm going to lose a lot of people here.  For the record, I think Carrey is fine actor, much better than many give him credit for.  However, like The Grinch, I felt he was miscast.  True, the confines of the character Scrooge greatly limited him to how crazy he can be.  However, since he also played multiple roles here, he was able to space out the energy bursts over several planes.  As Scrooge, he tried to grain his voice to sound like an old man, and it was so painfully artificial.  Also, his dialogue was often delivered in so many sporadic quips and chirps, it got really annoying.  If he was just a supporting actor in the film, I probably could have dismissed him.  However, since he was the main character, it was like a mosquito bite that just wouldn't stop itching.  His incessant laughing as the Ghost of Christmas Present was overboard and overlong.When Robert Zemeckis mentioned in an interview a few years ago that he felt all movies now should be done totally via CGI, I wanted to cringe.  There is nothing wrong with diverting to this format once in a while, but I am SO glad than most other directors have not adopted this idiotic philosophy.  Each scene in Zemeckis' last two CGI films were meticulously crafted and were crucial to the final product.  Here, however, I felt it needlessly dragged in many spots, especially with an overlong chase scene and the sequence with the Ghost of Christmas Future.The animation, especially the backdrop detail is truly amazing even getting down to Scrooge's nose-hairs.  However, unlike The Polar Express and Beowulf which had existed before merely as illustrations, Christmas Carol has been done on screen before several times and with a fine ensemble of actors to boot.  The Polar Express and Beowulf were fresh and original cinematic milestones.  This was not.  Having watched Alastair Sim, George C. Scott, and Reginald Owen pour their hearts out in earlier versions, they bring an emotional punch that no CGI character can EVER match.

The level of detail and the visual effects were simply amazing. Concerning the 3-D effects, I would say that they made the movie dimensional, but there were not many of those ""coming right at you"" types of effects. Rather the 3-D added a higher level of realism to the movie. The only 3-D effect that seemed to come right out of the screen was the snow, and this was happening throughout a large portion of the movie. I found it distracting after a while.I do agree that this movie is clearly not for children. It was almost always dreary and dark, and children would find it scary. In addition, something I haven't seen mentioned is that the dialogue is written as if this were an English period movie. I have to admit there were times I couldn't grasp what was being said, and this usually isn't a problem for me. My wife who loves period movies also had the same problem. I think children would get very lost quickly.We're big fans of Jim Carrey. Carey's so unique and so talented, and he did a great job. However if you're expecting anything funny because he's playing the lead, remember that this movie does not have comedy.Despite all of the things that are great about this movie, frankly I got bored (Please don't batter me because I'm sharing my opinion. I realize a lot of people will justifiably love this movie, but there will be others who are similar to me and will want to know what to expect).My favorite version of A Christmas Carol is Scrooged with Bill Murray. It was funny, entertaining, edgy, creative and so engaging. It got the message across, and I enjoyed the humor. This movie version was quite the opposite: Dark, serious, scary enough to potentially disturb children, and dreary. Of course there's nothing wrong with this, but it just didn't appeal to me, or hold my attention.Regardless, the story has a wonderful message, and this movie is fantastically crafted.

The picture quality is as expected, with flawless details and amazing depth carried throughout. The colors and saturation look exquisite and there are plenty of chances for failure with that floating candle ghost and the amount of dark alleys and rooms. The special features are a serious mixed bag though.* Making of/Capturing Dickens, 14:39 minutes. Visually narrated by a very irritating actress trying to be funny but she wasn't. Screening it for customers had them asking to fast forward past her to get to the few good points of how they made the film, it is worth skipping this option and watching the next one:* On set with Sammi, 2 minutes. Short but very informative look into how they did the motion capture effects with her - short but to the point and worthy.* Deleted scenes, 6 @ 8:39 minutes with quick Zemeckis intro. All are in rough format with the actual actor face(s) placed on the animated characters. Not fun to watch as the format gets distracting. Better at that point to watch the main feature with the PiP.* 25 Days of Christmas. Cannot stress enough the frustration and unworthiness of this feature. If you do perform this function make sure your player is smoking fast. After it loads up, 25 icons appear on your screen that when selected, a quick or fun little Christmas icon pops up and goes away just as fast, then goes back to menu. It does not let you select ahead so by the time I got to 9 I was fried.* Blu Ray 3D info with the Lion King critters, 4:13 minutes. A marketing promo for the new format with some stock footage from the films of two of the critters. Skipper.* Dig Copy promo.* Disc 2 - DVD with most of the features and specs as listed on the DVD package.* Motion Capture Picture-in-Picture during playback, optional commentary with Zemeckis. I was disappointed with this as they went with a 10% screen fill instead of a bigger shot. All scenes from credits to credits have the actual footage taken in the effects studio with the actors. Fun to watch to see how the transfers were actually done and what the actors looked like. It plays well in the store for people to see how it was all done, too much going on when the commentary was selected so left that off after the first 10 minutes so cannot review his content.The picture was beautiful, the DTS was outstanding.

WIlliams,"[6, 8]","This was a relatively faithful adaptation of the Charles Dicken's Christmas classic with a few seemingly added-just-for-3D visual sequences that were both annoying and slightly nauseating when watched in the non-3D Blu-Ray version.My problem with the movie is that the last thing we need is another faithful movie rendition of ""A Christmas Carol,"" perhaps the most filmed story of all time. I was expecting a Disney twist and, I admit, a bit of kid-friendly magic, a la Robert Zemeckis' endlessly charming ""Polar Express,"" and instead got Dicksonian-prose (baffling to most children and many adults) and the occasional uninspired 3D shot, clearly done just for the wow-look-at-that effect. (The shrinking to mouse-size scene was nonsensical, never explained, and clearly done solely to add in some more 3D moments.)My son was bored and occasionally frightened and I didn't see any point in using name-above-the-title star Jim Carrey, whom I usually despise, but here just found totally generic. (Again, unlike Tom Hanks, who inhabited every role he portrayed in ""Polar Express."") There may have been much Carrey-esque scene munching and physical angst during the motion capture shoot that created this movie, but little of it comes through in the final onscreen product, which I found dull and not even touching, the very thing the original story excels so well at and why it's been a relevant tale for close to two hundred years.Tiny Tim is barely introduced, and only fleetingly referred to, so our feeling for his disappearance in Christmas future is limited--thus missing the heart and soul of Dicken's story--and Scrooge's redemption is rushed and not at all believable. He seems not a changed man, but rather a still-bitter man now frightened into acts of kindness by an impending demise that never before occurred to him, apparently, despite his wildly advanced age.Taken solely as an animated adaption of Dicken's tale, the movie is so-so, with a fairly faithful plot line, but with little to appeal to children outside the high-tech computer animation. As a Disney movie, the entire effort falls flat and even the much dated, far lower budget, ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" does a much better job of introducing the story and entertaining younger children.

My 10 yr old watched it without any trouble.  You know your kid, I recommend previewing if you have any doubts, or check out the parent review on IMDb. They do a great job outlining movies specifically for parents.)What do you get when you put Jim Carey, Gary Oldman and  Colin Firth in a Robert Zemechis  movie?  A great movie!  This classic story has been updated with  Zemechis' animation technique while staying true to the story.  There are some rather dark elements that I think Dickens himself would approve of.  Carey and Oldman deliver their multiple characters beautifully.  I find it ironic that Carey, who usually plays a character that makes us laugh (Mask) plays Scrooge and the 3 Ghosts, while Oldman, who usually plays the bad guy (Sirius Black, Sid Viscous, Dracula..to name a few of his brilliantly delivered bad guys..) plays Tiiny Tim, Bob Cratchet and Jacob Marley (we couldn't have all these crazy characters without giving Oldman one bad guy, could we?)  There are some scenes at are a bit darker that we are used to.  I think Zemechis had the courage to show the story as the dark story that it really is instead of trying to 'pretty it up' as has been done with previous versions.  My 10 year old son has watched it without any trouble.  If you have a child that is sensitive to dark images, you might want to preview it first...then decide.",5,Great movie!

1355170,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B003NFM3JK,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 1]","I actually liked Robert Zemeckis' new film ""A Christmas Carol"", which surprised me.A few years ago, Zemeckis began to use and develop his own motion capture technology. Basically, in motion capture, an actor wears a special suit with pinpoints all over it. A special camera films the live actor as they perform and this is transformed into an animated character. This technology allows the filmmakers to create a more human animated character with more fluid movements. The main advance of Zemecki's work seems to be they are able to use this same technique for facial expressions, allowing the characters to be more emotive and responsive to the action going on, The first film using this new technology, ""The Polar Express"" starring Tom Hanks in a number of roles, is a strange film. All of the people in the film look like zombies and have soulless eyes. The second film was ""Beowulf"" and it was a SLIGHT improvement, but not much. Now, we have a new retelling of Charles Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"" starring Jim Carrey as Scrooge and a number of other characters. A vast improvement.There are a couple of things at work, contributing to make this film more enjoyable. In the past few years, the use of Digital 3-D has exploded and it seems particularly suited to animated films. Now, some studios will only release an animated film in 3-D. Why? The premium charged for the 3-D glasses helps the box office. And I don't mind paying the premium either, because this new 3-D technology is heads and shoulders above what we are used to. I decided to see ""A Christmas Carol"" in IMAX 3-D. If I thought regular old Digital 3-D was good, IMAX 3-D is AWESOME. There is a product trailer at the beginning, which makes you feel like you are being transported into the screen. The screen size, enhanced projection and great sound system all work in concert to create an almost immersive experience, exactly what 3-D is trying to accomplish in the first place.When I initially heard about this film and the use of Zemecki's technique, I as skeptical. I just didn't like ""The Polar Express"" or ""Beowulf"" that much. Why is Zemeckis so enamored of this technology? He can have all of the actors on one completely bare soundstage and transport them to Victorian London. It must save a fortune to not have to physically create all of the sets, props, costumes, etc.But from the first moment of the new film, you feel as though you are being transported to a new time and place. The book opens and we see the first words of the immortal tale and a line drawing before the drawing becomes the film, dropping us next to Scrooge as he inspects the dead body of Jacob Marley, his longtime business partner.With each new scene, Zemeckis and his team recreate a different part or aspect of Victorian London and they leave no small detail untouched. Some of the scenes look like paintings, but in a good way, lush, beautiful and evocative of a different time and place. Others look dark and foreboding, scary and haunted. These compositions really seem to come to life and help to make the story seem real and authentic.There are still some problems with this technology. They seem to have fixed the problem with the eyes, but now the characters have this weird look to the faces. For instance, Colin Firth plays Scrooge's nephew, Fred. Fred looks a lot like Colin Firth, but they have given the character a larger chin, a Jay Leno chin. I guess because Scrooge has the same. But the chin makes his face seem odd. Gary Oldman plays Bob Cratchit and he seems to be a short man, shorter than even Gary Oldman is in real life. To accommodate for this, they have made his head more squashed and round than it is. His face still looks like Gary Oldman, just squashed and round. Each of the characters looks like the actor portraying them, with 'make-up' enhancements, but their faces seem to be stretched onto mannequins, a little like examples of plastic surgery gone bad, like the skin is stretched a little too tight. This and the combination of the odd enhancements make most of the characters seem unpleasantly weird.Because the filmmakers create the exact look and feel of the characters, one actor can play multiple roles.  Jim Carrey plays Scrooge as an old man and at different times throughout his life and all three Ghosts of Christmas. Carrey does an excellent job and brings Scrooge to life, making him seem like the most despising miser ever. The film opens with Scrooge visiting his recently deceased partner Jacob Marley at the funeral home. Convinced his partner is dead, he pauses the undertaker and quickly takes the coins resting on Marley's eyes. Seven years later, when he returns home on Christmas Eve, he walks through his dark house, reluctant to light lamps. He gives his assistant, Bob Cratchit, a dressing down for merely looking at a new lump of coal as he shivers uncontrollably at his desk in the cold office. But then you probably know all of this already because I have no doubt you have seen at least one version of this story already.Carrey has already proven he is an adept comedian, willing and able to do just about anything for a laugh. He has also done some good work in more dramatic roles. In ""A Christmas Carol"", he does more dramatic work giving a real depth to Scrooge and all of his personal prejudices against the poor, his family, happiness. At one point, there is an extended chase that feels odd, almost as though it has been included to up the comedy level, to ensure Carrey has access to some slapstick.I find it odd that Carrey is listed as the actor providing the voice for the Ghost of Christmas Present. In the film, this ghost is represented as a semi-opaque black specter, very scary and very much like you would imagine a ghost to be. But this ghost doesn't have a face and I don't think he utters a single word. What exactly did Carrey do to portray this character? Stand and point?The Ghost of Christmas Past looks the most like Carrey, like the filmmakers used his face and simply pasted it on a flame. The Ghost of Christmas Present looks like a cross between Santa Claus and Jim Carrey. What I am describing to you probably sounds very familiar, again because you have no doubt seen another version of this same story.Zemeckis and his team have done a great job of making all of the familiar bits of the book look real and they have adapted the book in a way that seems more faithful. For instance, the Ghost of Christmas Future is a scary specter and would give anyone a fright. It actually might be the scariest representation of the ghost I have ever seen. Marley's Ghost is also pretty terrifying and the darkness, the cavernous of Scrooge's lonely, empty home has been brought to life in a way that most film adaptations couldn't even attempt. Strangely, the spaces don't only look real, they seem to have depth.The depiction of Victorian London, at Christmastime, is really beautiful. Even the dirty, rundown, awful parts they show look like you would imagine Victorian London to be. But the good parts? These moments are what many of us think Christmas should be like. It really puts you in the spirit for Christmas.Which makes me wonder why Disney released the film so freaking early? November 9th? I know they didn't want to compete with Avatar for 3-D screens, but releasing the film three weeks before Thanksgiving when people just aren't in the mood yet? If I were Disney I would have switched the release dates of ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""The Princess and the Frog"". The traditionally animated ""Princess"" would have already transformed the box office. Instead, ""A Christmas Carol""'s box office seems a little miserly.",4,Zemecki's Technology Matches The Story - Beautiful,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,7669,"['actually', 'liked', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis',

1355172,A9HB18W9DAC1V,B003NFM3JK,Toby J Martin,"[1, 2]","Taking a piece of literature and turning it into a feature film is a risky endeavor. By taking your own vision and projecting it into a form everyone can see, you're instantly setting yourself up for constant criticisms thoughout the film...""Well this isn't how I pictured this city to look at all""...""She shouldn't look like that, I thought she would be ______""...""He lived in the book, why did he die in the movie""...The more well known the book/story is, the more this will inevitable happen as well.I mention all of this, because 2009's A Christmas Carol, will take most preconceptions of what Dickens' story portrayed, and twist them visually in some strange ways. One quick thing to note about the movie, is that only a handful of characters look ""good"" in the animation style that the film uses. Scrooge, the ghosts, and one or two other main characters look normal, but the rest of the people in this world are extremely creepy looking, almost like something you would see from Lord of the Rings.The film opens with Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) seeing his dead partner's corpse, pronouncing him dead, rips off the funeral workers (setting his ""scrooge"" ways in action), and leaves the morgue, which starts a fly-by of the city and it's villagers while Scrooge is traveling to work. Upon arriving to his office, the movie fast forwards seven years into the future, and starts the classic tale we all know. We meet Cratchit (Gary Oldman), who is extremely creepy looking, and we meet two of the charity collectors who Scrooge decides to take down a few notches. Scrooge's nephew Fred (Colin Firth) comes to invite him to family dinner, but Scrooge quickly points out how much Christmas is worthless, and he wouldn't dare be bothered to arrive. At the end of this work shift (Dec 24th), Cratchit asks to have all of Christmas off, which sets Scrooge off into another one of his trademark fits, but is eventually allowed to spend the day with his family, only if he comes into work early on the 26th.This is the point where the film takes a lot of weird turns, and if you truly enjoy the classic film/novel versions of Christmas Carol, you will probably not enjoy the next 40-50 minutes of the movie.Scrooge gets home, and upon arriving to his front door, sees a ghosts face on his door knocker. He gets startled, and falls down his front steps in what looks to be a painful way. One thing throughout this movie, is that Scrooge is constantly falling/getting beat up, and it never seems to affect a man who must be 60-70 years old. While sitting in his bedroom, he starts to hear his door rattle, and then the ghost of Jacob Marley appears. By appears, I mean throws ghostly metal boxes through the door at Scrooge, and then eventually comes in after them. They talk about the three ghosts coming to visit Scrooge tonight, and Marley lets him know the times they are coming./* I don't know if it was just me, but if you listen to the times that the ghost gives for the visits, they don't match up with the timeline of the movie */Marley's ghost does all sort of weird things while he's talking, such as ripping his jaw off, and then slapping it up and down on his mouth, to talk to Scrooge, and then pulls it over his face to finish the conversation. This is one of those weird moments that started to ""ruin"" the movie for me. I realize it's a retelling, and the director can do whatever he wants, but it just seems like they want to make the movie ""extreme"".Marley's ghost leaves, and the story progresses as you would expect. The Ghost of Christmas Past (Jim Carrey), which is a ghost body with a candle's flame for a face/head, shows Scrooge his sad childhood. The Ghost of Christmas Present (Jim Carrey), is a big jovial man (about 20-30 feet tall) who shows Scrooge how much fun people can have being either poor, or without his miserable company. These two ghosts, while visually weird looking, are pretty spot on to how the original book was written.The Ghost of Christmas Future, is the one which bothers me the most. The ghost is the Grim Reaper (which is fine), but the sequence of events involving him are ridiculous. This part (maybe 5-10 minutes), is slapstick comedy, where Scrooge is somehow shrunken, talking with a squeaky ""I've been shrunk"" voice, and falls through street drains and runs through pipes in an attempt to get away from the ghost. This scene goes on way too long, and you'll eventually find yourself asking when the ghost will finally catch him to continue the story.After all of the visions are done for the night, Scrooge wakes up, feels proud to be alive, and runs through town celebrating his new found love for everyone. There's a few touching moments here as Scrooge rights his wrongs, but nothing that wouldn't be expected.As a whole, the entire movie is one of those feel good Christmas stories, where you can watch it with your family, and maybe learn a life lesson or two throughout. The major flaw I see with this adaptation, as I said earlier, the visuals will either make or break this movie for you, but other then that, I have no real complaints.",3,My review,1279670400,"07 21,

1355176,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B003NFM3JK,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 2]","Robert Zemeckis' new ""A Christmas Carol"" story is an animated film using the art of ""performance capture,"" where actors' movements are digitally recorded and translated into CGI. So what you will see here is not Jim Carrey himself, but the computer graphic animation of Jim Carrey. Considering his superb performance as Count Olaf in ""Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events,"" I think Jim Carrey playing Scrooge in a live-action film would be a better choice, but it seems Mr. Zemeckis didn't think so.(By the way, I have watched the film in the conventional 2-D format. These 3-D glasses are too much of a distraction for me.)The classic story of Charles Dickens needs no new introduction. Old miser Scrooge is given a chance to reform his life through the visitation of three ghosts. The basic storyline remains the same in Disney's adaptation, but it seems Robert Zemeckis thought he needed something new to sort of spice up the content.Besides the aforementioned performance capture and 3-D, Robert Zemeckis-directed ""A Christmas Carol"" stars Jim Carrey in multiple roles. That means he plays Scrooge (young and old) as well as the three ghosts. Not only that. Most co-stars play more than one character in Mr. Zemeckis' version. So, (animated) Gary Oldman ""plays"" the three roles - Bob Cratchit, Marley and Tiny Tim. But what is the point of doing this?The tone of the film is also pretty different at times, compared with other versions. As some reviewers have pointed out, some scenes (especially the entrance of Marley's ghost) will be scary for kids and, perhaps, even for adults. The second half of the film contains a rather lengthy ""chase"" scene of the mouse-sized Scrooge. But do we really need this?Obviously Robert Zemeckis, whose recent works include ""The Polar Express"" and ""Beowulf,"" thinks the cinema's future lies in the advanced visual technologies. Whether he is right or not is yet to see, but for those who still remember Mr. Zemeckis as the creator of imaginative and innovative ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" like me, what really matters in making people happy is something else.",3,"Could Be Better with Jim Carrrey Himself, Not Performance Captured",1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,2108,"['Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'new', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'story', 'animated', 'film', 'using', 'art', 'performance', 'capture', 'where', 'actors', 'movements', 'are', 'digitally', 'recorded', 'translated', 'CGI', 'So', 'what', 'will', 'see', 'here', 'not', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'computer', 'graphic', 'animation', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Considering', 'superb', 'performance', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'think', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'playing', 'Scrooge', 'live-action', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'choice', 'Mr.', 'Zemeckis', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'way', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'conventional', '2-D', 'format', '3-D', 'glasses', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'distraction', 'classic', 'story', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'new', 'introduction', 'Old', 'miser', 'Scrooge', 'given', 'chance', 'reform', 'life', 'visitation', 'three', 'ghosts', 'basic', 'storyline', 'same', 'Disney', 'adaptation', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'thought', 'needed', 'something', 'new', 'sort', 'spice', 'content.Besides', 'aforementioned', 'performance', 'capture', '3-D', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis-directed', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'multiple', 'roles', 'Scrooge', 'young', 'old', 'as', 'well', 'three', 'ghosts', 'Not', 'only', 'that', 'Most', 'co-stars', 'play', 'more', 'one', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Zemeckis', 'version', 'So', 'animated', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'plays', 'three', 'roles', 'Bob', 'Cratchit', 'Marley', 'Tiny', 'Tim', 'what', 'point', 'doing', 'tone', 'film', 'also', 'pretty', 'different', 'times', 'compared', 'other', 'versions', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'scenes', 'especially', 'entrance', 'Marley', 'ghost', 'will', 'be', 'scary', 'kids', 'perhaps', 'even', 'adults', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'rather', 'lengthy', 'chase', 'scene', 'mouse-sized', 'Scrooge', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'Obviously', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'recent', 'include', 'Polar', 'Express', 'Beowulf', 'cinema', 'future', 'advanced', 'visual', 'technologies', 'right', 'not', 'yet', 'see', 'who', 'still', 'remember', 'Mr.', 'Zemeckis', 'creator', 'imaginative', 'innovative', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'making', 'people', 'happy', 'something', 'else']",Disney's A Christmas Carol

The ghosts were extra creepy and Scrooge was more unlikeable than ever with no redeeming qualities at all.

Scott, Mickey's Christmas Carol, one with a London Humbug, and Mr. Magoo's version.The reason for my rating on this one: 1 star for animation. 1 star for voice acting. -3 stars for the scary images.I felt like I was walking through Transylvania at Christmas time. I've never been a fan of creepy things and this reminded me why.Major Spoilers below:It opens with Marley laying in his coffin. I felt that was a new way to do it, but I've got to admit, I hated it. The last thing I want to do is look at a dead man. I didn't mind Scrooge going through the streets and seeing how others avoided him. But once the ghost of Marley entered the scene, rolled his eyeballs around in his skull and flapped his ripped jaw, I was feeling freaked out. My first thought was: I'm never letting my kids see this movie!When we get to the ghost of C. Past I was surprised to see a ghost that resembled a candle stick. When he spoke, he sounded like a hissing flame. I couldn't see his face very well (granted he was fire, but still I wanted to see more definition). I didn't like him.C. Present started out well enough, I liked his throaty laugh. But his &#34;end&#34; was too much for me. I always preferred the fading out, shine, or sparkle effect to let the viewers know he was leaving. In this one he literally has a heart attack and DIES! He becomes a laughing skeleton! O_O!!! Then Ignorance and Want (the kids under the robes) spring up and turn into a knifing thug who's caged and then a prostitute who gets straight-jacketed and drug off screaming into the dark. If I'd been a kid, I would've ducked behind a couch!C. Future. He was the one I expected to be scary and I definitely wasn't disappointed. But the carriage chase scene...not needed. I'm pretty sure they only stuck it in for the 3D thing they were doing at the theaters.Overall, there wasn't enough of that warmth or happiness that you get in the other films when you watch the Crachetts, Nephew Fred, or the Fezzwigs celebrate their Christmases. I needed more of the family love and kindness, the joyful feel of celebration going on in order to care about them. Instead, I found myself very distanced in order to be mentally shielded from any another deteriorating ghost that might pop up in the movie. I couldn't even get a feel for Tiny-Tim. I felt for Bob when he went up the stairs, but that's about it.There were three swears during the film, not needed.When Scrooge came to himself, I was happy the film was nearly at it's end. When it was over, my mind was still reeling over the laughing skull of Christmas Present.
