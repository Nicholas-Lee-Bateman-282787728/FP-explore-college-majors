938655,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000BB18L8,A Customer,"[3, 6]","Viewers who are expecting Happy Endings to be a repeat of Don Roos' terrific black comedy, The Opposite of Sex are going to be sorely disappointed. Gone is the mordantly acerbic humor, and in its place is a film that is so overstuffed with themes and ideas, that so often it seems to be in danger of crashing down all around us.Happy Endings is such a disappointing film - overlong, rambling, self indulgent, and diffuse; it's a movie deals with far too much - same sex parenting, abortion, motherhood, infidelity, and people who desire the wrong people for the wrong reasons - undoubtedly it's earnest in it's intentions, but it ultimately ends up conveying very little.While The Sex Opposite of Sex was tart, taut, and totally entertaining, Happy Endings is a messy, over-the-top triptych of tainted-love stories that's undone by its blind ambition. There's simply too much going on here, with too many characters and too many stories all vying for screen time, that at various stages in the movie, you get the distinct impression that Roos and his screenwriting collaborators are probably making up much of the plot as they go along.The main plot thread concerns Mamie (Lisa Kudrow), a counselor at a Planned Parenthood clinic who gave up her own child for adoption years ago. As she tries to learn the identity of the child, she has to submit to the blackmail of Nicky (Jesse Bradford), a snarky documentary filmmaker. Mamie also stumbles upon Javier, a handsome Mexican illegal (Bobby Cannavale) working as a ""masseur'' in the sex industry; it is though Javier that she happens upon the idea to use his experiences to help Nicky produce his documentary film and thereby learn the name of her child.Mamie's British stepbrother Charley (Steve Coogan) has similar issues. Charlie and his boyfriend Gilbert (David Sutcliffe) begin to suspect that their best friends Dianne and Pam (Sarah Clarke and Laura Dern) have used the boyfriend's sperm to birth their own child.Meanwhile, Otis (Jason Ritter) works as one of Charley's employees and obviously has a crush on him. But that doesn't stop him from sleeping with Jude, his band's new lead singer (Maggie Gyllenhaal). However, she has her eye on Frank (Tom Arnold).  Jude is an untalented vocalist who worms her way into Otis's mediocre nightclub act. She's not just content to ruin Otis and his father's personal life, but she also exerts a profound change on the band's creative direction.These three basic story ideas are all needlessly involved, any one of which could be the basis of a decent feature, but Roos throws them all in together and gussies them up with preposterous complications. Snatches of clever dialogue float disconnectedly through the director's set pieces, leaving scene after scene to be narrowly redeemed by some terrific acting that's far better than this film deserves.Gyllenhaal is an absolutely dreadful singer, but her character is spot-on; she's so wonderfully and naturally slouchy-sexy as much as her character is an artificial shrew. Tom Arnold is impressively vulnerable and honorable as the story's one guileless man; and Kudrow - the absolute highlight of the film - is a heartbreaker, and also a wonderfully vulnerable muse.Although the performances are good, nothing can save Happy Endings from its definitive lack of substance, each meandering scene little more than a composite of quirks and one-liners; the totally hip ensemble cast playing games further embroidered by the regular appearance of title cards that comment on the action. These cards don't just tell us who the characters are, but where they come from, where they're going and how we should feel about them. It's all fun for the first ten minutes, but rather than enhancing narrative clarity, the effect soon becomes completely distracting.

938656,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000BB18L8,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Ultimately, `Happy Endings' is hodgepodge of intersecting stories that all come together in the end to create a tapestry of heartfelt and rewarding vignettes that never really play out quite like vignettes.  They shuffle back and forth, each one as enticing as the one that came before it, and they build to a strong finish (I just LOVE that ending) that captivates and, quite unexpectedly, lingers.Deep in this collage of sincere interactions we have a woman named Mamie who is recoiling, still, from the aftermath of sleeping with her step-brother, Charley, who is now `out'.  Charley and his lover Gil are good friends with lesbian couple Pam and Diane, who have just had a baby and are slowly wearing on the fibers of Charley's sanity.  But Charlie has other problems, which include an employee named Otis, a young kid who is somewhat obsessed with him.  Otis is being blackmailed (sort of) by a flirtatious girl named Jude who wants to hook up with Otis's father, mostly for his money.  Big `shifts' are on the horizon for everyone when Mamie is contacted by a young man who claims to know where her adopted son is (the result of `sleeping with said stepbrother').And with that, the strings are pulled and the fabric of this intricate tapestry starts to unravel.The performances locked within this film are all outstanding, especially Maggie Gyllenhaal and Tom Arnold (who would have thunk it), who just beautifully flesh out an oddly matched love story that seems almost believably appropriate.  Coogan, Ritter and Dern all hold their own here, delivering memorable performances, and of course there is Kudrow who once again anchors her film with a great combination of stern intensity and undeniable wit (she colors comedy effortlessly).  But, at the end of the day, this movie belongs to Maggie Gyllenhaal.  Even the script itself is in love with her, giving her the most intoxicating `ending' possible (by simply not giving her one at all).  Yes, by speculating her outcome, Jude remains a mystery, one that we are drawn to and continue to tease in our mind's eye.In all honesty, her combination of vulnerability and arrogant manipulation (through flirtations) make her turn a sheer revelation.At the end of the day I wholly recommend this film.  It is sharp and clever and unique and grounded, a quality that is hard to come by in a film that is so scattered thematically.  Writer/director Don Roos colors each character completely, creating real people and real problems and real situations that keep us glued to every scene.Bravo!",5,It's all about that ending...,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,2542,"['Ultimately', 'Happy', 'Endings', 'hodgepodge', 'intersecting', 'stories', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'create', 'tapestry', 'heartfelt', 'rewarding', 'vignettes', 'never', 'really', 'play', 'out', 'quite', 'vignettes', 'shuffle', 'back', 'forth', 'one', 'as', 'enticing', 'one', 'came', 'build', 'strong', 'finish', 'just', 'LOVE', 'ending', 'quite', 'unexpectedly', 'lingers.Deep', 'collage', 'sincere', 'interactions', 'have', 'woman', 'named', 'Mamie', 'who', 'recoiling', 'still', 'aftermath', 'sleeping', 'step-brother', 'Charley', 'who', 'now', 'out', 'Charley', 'lover', 'Gil', 'are', 'good', 'friends', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'Pam', 'Diane', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'had', 'baby', 'are', 'slowly', 'wearing', 'fibers', 'Charley', 'sanity', 'Charlie', 'other', 'problems', 'include', 'employee', 'named', 'Otis', 'young', 'kid', 'who', 'somewhat', 'obsessed', 'Otis', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'sort', 'flirtatious', 'girl', 'named', 'Jude', 'who', 'hook', 'up', 'Otis', 'father', 'mostly', 'money', 'Big', 'shifts', 'are', 'horizon', 'everyone', 'when', 'Mamie', 'contacted', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'know', 'where', 'adopted', 'son', 'result', 'sleeping', 'said', 'stepbrother', '.And', 'strings', 'are', 'pulled', 'fabric', 'intricate', 'tapestry', 'unravel.The', 'performances', 'locked', 'film', 'are', 'outstanding', 'especially', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thunk', 'who', 'just', 'beautifully', 'flesh', 'out', 'oddly', 'matched', 'love', 'story', 'almost', 'believably', 'appropriate', 'Coogan', 'Ritter', 'Dern', 'hold', 'own', 'here', 'delivering', 'memorable', 'performances', 'course', 'Kudrow', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'anchors', 'film', 'great', 'combination', 'stern', 'intensity', 'undeniable', 'wit', 'comedy', 'effortlessly', 'end', 'day', 'movie', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Even', 'script', 'love', 'giving', 'most', 'intoxicating', 'ending', 'possible', 'simply', 'not', 'giving', 'one', 'Yes', 'speculating', 'outcome', 'Jude', 'mystery', 'one', 'are', 'drawn', 'continue', 'tease', 'mind', 'eye.In', 'honesty', 'combination', 'vulnerability', 'arrogant', 'manipulation', 'flirtations', 'make', 'turn', 'sheer', 'end', 'day', 'wholly', 'recommend', 'film', 'sharp', 'clever', 'unique', 'grounded', 'quality', 'hard', 'come', 'film', 'so', 'scattered', 'thematically', 'Writer/director', 'Don', 'Roos', 'colors', 'character', 'completely', 'creating', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'problems', 'real', 'situations', 'keep', 'glued', 'scene.Bravo']",N/A
938657,AYJ6P9F8GX9XF,B000BB18L8,Cecily Champagne,"[11, 13]","I thought that ""Happy Endings"" contained a lot of worthy elements.  That I nonetheless loathed this movie shows just how greatly it failed on every other level.As has been outlined in other reviews, ""Happy Endings"" contains a number of interwoven stories, including: a mother searching for the son she gave up for adoption many years prior (*and* her Mexican masseuse/lover *and* the zany would-be documentarian who is a.) blackmailing her and b.) hoping to film her search for the now-grown child), a gay couple who is questioning the paternity of their lesbian friends' young son, and a naughty young wannabe singer who seduces a gay drummer in order to get closer to his wealthy father.This doesn't just *seem* like a lot of story for one film ... it is a lot of story for one film.  And it doesn't help that writer/director Don Roos' script is incessantly bouncy.  We are thrown in and pulled out of these tangent plots without ever having a chance to develop an affection for the characters or any sympathy for their plights.  Of course, some filmmakers are able to successfully weave different stories together (Altman, for an obvious example) ... so the problem with ""Happy Endings"" is greater than its jerky and complex storyline.  The real problem is that I couldn't care less about (most of) the characters.Another thing I very much disliked about this film was its use of narrative captions.  People say that voice-over is the mark of a lazy writer.  If that's true, then captions are the mark of a VERY lazy writer.  And they just plain did not work well with this movie.  Every time I found myself feeling somewhat absorbed by the story, Roos would throw out a ""witty"" and ironic caption that jerked me back to reality.  It's as if he wants us to respond emotionally to his movie - but then he keeps reminding us ""this is just a movie, and I'm a wry director.""  You can't have it both ways.Really, Roos just comes across as manipulative to me.  Take the first scene.  Why does he show Lisa Kudrow being slammed by the car?  Simply for the shock value - for the sake of getting our attention.  There is no reason for him to jump ahead in the story and start with this scene (right after she is hit, the narrative caption informs us that she is not dead - and then it jumps back in time to when the story *actually* starts).  Come to think of it, there's no reason for Kudrow to get hit by the car at all.  When the story does arrive at that point (toward the end of the film), the car hits her and then nothing more comes of it.  It lends nothing to the plot.  Cheap.  Manipulative.With that said, there are a few very funny bits of dialogue in the film (the humorous moments, though few and far between, are deliciously black).  Also, Maggie Gyllenhaal did a really great job with her character (the singing seductress).  Her performance was fresh, spirited and poignant, and, by the end of the movie, she was the one person I felt a connection to.  But these are hardly redeeming elements.  Some people obviously like this movie, but I thought it was uninspired, confused and boring.  If you want to watch a better version of ""Happy Endings"" - i.e. a very dark comedy that touches on drama, with a number of interwoven stories and a subversive plot - watch Todd Solondz's ""Happiness.""  It's infinitely more compelling.",2,Major Disappointment,1152576000,"07 11, 2006",2006,3332,"['thought', 'Happy', 'Endings', 'contained', 'lot', 'worthy', 'elements', 'nonetheless', 'loathed', 'movie', 'just', 'how', 'greatly', 'failed', 'other', 'level.As', 'been', 'outlined', 'other', 'reviews', 'Happy', 'Endings', 'number', 'interwoven', 'stories', 'including', 'mother', 'searching', 'son', 'gave', 'up', 'adoption', 'many', 'years', 'prior', 'Mexican', 'masseuse/lover', '*and*', 'zany', 'would-be', 'documentarian', 'who', 'blackmailing', 'b', 'hoping', 'film', 'search', 'now-grown', 'child', 'gay', 'couple', 'who', 'questioning', 'paternity', 'lesbian', 'friends', 'young', 'son', 'naughty', 'young', 'wannabe', 'singer', 'who', 'gay', 'drummer', 'order', 'get', 'closer', 'wealthy', 'father.This', ""n't"", 'just', '*seem*', 'lot', 'story', 'one', 'film', 'lot', 'story', 'one', 'film', ""n't"", 'help', 'writer/director', 'Don', 'Roos', 'script', 'incessantly', 'bouncy', 'are', 'thrown', 'pulled', 'out', 'tangent', 'plots', 'ever', 'having', 'chance', 'develop', 'affection', 'characters', 'sympathy', 'plights', 'course', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'able', 'successfully', 'weave', 'different', 'stories', 'together', 'Altman', 'obvious', 'example', 'so', 'problem', 'Happy', 'Endings', 'greater', 'jerky', 'complex', 'storyline', 'real', 'problem', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'most', 'characters.Another', 'thing', 'very', 'much', 'disliked', 'film', 'was', 'use', 'narrative', 'captions', 'People', 'say', 'voice-over', 'mark', 'lazy', 'writer', 'true', 'then', 'captions', 'are', 'mark', 'VERY', 'lazy', 'writer', 'just', 'plain', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'well', 'movie', 'Every', 'time', 'found', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'absorbed', 'story', 'Roos', 'would', 'throw', 'out', 'witty', 'ironic', 'caption', 'jerked', 'back', 'reality', 'respond', 'emotionally', 'movie', 'then', 'reminding', 'just', 'movie', ""'m"", 'wry', 'director', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'ways.Really', 'Roos', 'just', 'across', 'manipulative', 'Take', 'first', 'scene', 'Why', 'show', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'being', 'slammed', 'car', 'Simply', 'shock', 'value', 'sake', 'getting', 'attention', 'reason', 'jump', 'ahead', 'story', 'start', 'scene', 'right', 'hit', 'narrative', 'caption', 'informs', 'not', 'dead', 'then', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'story', '*actually*', 'Come', 'think', 'reason', 'Kudrow', 'get', 'hit', 'car', 'When', 'story', 'arrive', 'point', 'end', 'film', 'car', 'then', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'plot', 'Cheap', 'Manipulative.With', 'said', 'are', 'few', 'very', 'funny', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'film', 'humorous', 'moments', 'few', 'far', 'are', 'deliciously', 'black', 'Also', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'did', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'character', 'singing', 'seductress', 'performance', 'was', 'fresh', 'spirited', 'poignant', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'person', 'felt', 'connection', 'are', 'hardly', 'redeeming', 'elements', 'people', 'obviously', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'uninspired', 'confused', 'boring', 'want', 'watch', 'better', 'version', 'Happy', 'Endings', 'i.e', 'very', 'dark', 'comedy', 'drama', 'number', 'interwoven', 'stories', 'subversive', 'plot', 'watch', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'Happiness', 'infinitely', 'more', 'compelling']",N/A

""Happy Endings"" may take a moment to grab hold, but it's a surprisingly rewarding movie with some really fine performances by Lisa Kudrow, Tom Arnold (serious), Steve Coogan, Jason Ritter and Maggie Gyllenhaal, among others.Yes, the film's ingredients -- family-minded gay couples, manipulative vixens, mixed signals, uncertain sexual orientations, pregnancy confusion and sharp-edged comedy  -- are all reminiscent of writer-director Don Roos' debut, ""The Opposite of Sex,"" and the look and structure bring ""Short Cuts"" and especially ""Magnolia"" to mind.But what this really reminded me of, strange as it may sound, is a suburban, non-violent ""Jackie Brown.""  That is, it's an L.A.-centric hang out movie that stretches out for a good long while and spends time with its characters and lets us see what the players cannot.After the first half-hour, I got into the movie's groove, even when it didn't always do what I wanted it to do (I didn't buy some of the twists involving Bobby Canavale's Mexican massage therapist).But the ending, the titular ""Happy Ending,"" or ""the last ending:"" as it's referred to in the cards, may be my favorite sequence in any film this year.  It's beautiful, it's perfectly staged and it just got me right in the chest. Maybe it's corny and maybe I should've completely seen it coming, but when Kudrow's character looks around the dancefloor at her wedding, and we realize who the people are that she's watching, it's a fine cinematic moment and one that made me want to go back and watch the entire story over again.",4,"""...and don't imagine you're too familiar and I don't see you anymore....""",1134777600,"12 17, 2005",2005,2061,"['watched', 'first', '20', 'min', 'got', 'interrupted', 'almost', 'never', 'went', 'back', 'first', 'thought', 'narrative', 'title', 'cards', 'felt', 'little', 'smug', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'traction', 'plot', 'knew', 'still', 'had', 'almost', '2', 'hours', 'left', 'ahead', 'worst', 'mind', 'time', 'yet', 'one', 'movies', 'five', 'six', 'different', 'characters', 'plots', 'interweave', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'degrees', 'separation', 'fates', 'are', 'linked', 'destiny', '.But', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'come', 'back', 'Happy', 'Endings', 'may', 'take', 'moment', 'grab', 'hold', 'surprisingly', 'rewarding', 'movie', 'really', 'fine', 'performances', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'serious', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'others.Yes', 'film', 'ingredients', 'family-minded', 'gay', 'couples', 'manipulative', 'vixens', 'mixed', 'signals', 'uncertain', 'sexual', 'orientations', 'pregnancy', 'confusion', 'sharp-edged', 'comedy', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'writer-director', 'Don', 'Roos', 'debut', 'Opposite', 'Sex', 'look', 'structure', 'bring', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'especially', 'Magnolia', 'mind.But', 'what', 'really', 'reminded', 'strange', 'may', 'sound', 'suburban', 'non-violent', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'L.A.-centric', 'hang', 'movie', 'out', 'good', 'long', 'spends', 'time', 'characters', 'see', 'what', 'players', 'can', 'not', '.After', 'first', 'half-hour', 'got', 'movie', 'groove', 'even', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'do', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'twists', 'involving', 'Bobby', 'Canavale', 'Mexican', 'massage', 'therapist', 'ending', 'titular', 'Happy', 'Ending', 'last', 'ending', 'referred', 'cards', 'may', 'be', 'favorite', 'sequence', 'film', 'year', 'beautiful', 'perfectly', 'staged', 'just', 'got', 'right', 'chest', 'corny', 'maybe', 'should', ""'ve"", 'completely', 'seen', 'coming', 'when', 'Kudrow', 'character', 'dancefloor', 'wedding', 'realize', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'watching', 'fine', 'cinematic', 'moment', 'one', 'made', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'entire', 'story', 'again']",N/A

The last depicts a gay man's (Steve Coogan's) attempt to prove that some lesbian friends of his used his lover's sperm to have a child. Got all that? Unfortunately, Happy Endings suffers from the recent Too Many Characters/Too Much Plot syndrome (see Syriana/She Hate Me/Magnolia). Some of the characters we care about, others we don't. The director should have eliminated the lesbian/gay couple plot entirely and focused on the other two. Or, even better, could have fixed on the Maggy Gillenhall story (which features a good performance by Tom Arnold).

We have Mamie (Kudrow) who at a young age was impregnated by her step-brother Charley (Coogan) and since then they've had very little contact.  Charley is now `out of the closet' and living with is boyfriend Gil (Sutcliffe) whose best friend Pam (Dern) and her lover Diane (Clarke) have just had a son (Pam being the mother) and are starting to ware on Charley's sanity.  Mamie on the other hand is involved with massage therapist Javier (Cannavale) and is not the slightest bit happy with her life, and that only gets worse after meeting Nicky (Bradford) who claims to know where her illegitimate son (the one she had with Charley and then gave up for adoption) is and wants to reunite them under the circumstance that he can film it for his documentary submission into film school.Then we have Jude (Gyllenhaal), a young attractive floozy who joins a band fronted by Otis (Ritter), a young boy confused about his sexuality and somewhat obsessed with his boss (Charley).  Jude exploits that fact, manipulating him into have sex with her in order to steer his father Frank (Arnold) away from speculation his homosexuality, and then using it as blackmail against Otis, forcing him to help her hook up with his father.  She is clearly only after his money (he's loaded) and this upsets Otis, but the idea of his father condemning his sexuality leave him no choice but to assist Jude.As these stories collide we are only drawn to each character, good and bad, and brought to an understanding of what each of them needs to be truly happy.  In the end we are given one long `happy ending' showing the outcome of all of these situations and how everyone involved was affected by the outcome...all except for Jude.  Her ending is pure speculation, and while that may distress some it really made sense to me.  Jude was by far the most engaging and interesting character in the film, due in part to Gyllenhaal's brilliant Oscar caliber performance, and to have her be the only one to get nothing out of the interaction in a way leaves me satisfied, for she was also the most mysterious of the group, for while her intentions where clear what was unclear was her motivation.Gyllenhaal did absolutely outstanding here, delivering a performance that outweighed most I've seen all year and definitely deserved some awards attention.  Also, Kudrow did wonderful, playing against type, but not `Wonderland' against type for her character still infused the comedic timing she is so well loved for...she just honed it into a more mature comedy.  Tom Arnold and Steve Coogan are also wonderfully cast, and while she's only on screen a short time, Laura Dern is always a pure delight.  I would recommend this film to anyone for it truly was the most satisfying experience, one of at least, I've had for all of 2005.",5,A brilliant beginning and middle can only reap a happy ending!,1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,3451,"['have', 'say', 'Happy', 'Endings', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'most', 'fulfilling', 'experiences', ""'ve"", 'had', 'cinema', 'year', 'film', 'closing', 'was', 'left', 'content', 'approving', 'never', 'once', 'feeling', 'gypped', 'left', 'wanting', 'was', 'completely', 'satisfied', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'read', 'few', 'reviews', 'where', 'people', 'loved', 'everything', 'ending', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'ending', 'close-up', 'wonderfully', 'talented', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'singing', 'lullaby.', 'Happy', 'Endings', 'title', 'made', 'reference', 'act', 'making', 'massage', 'customer', 'EXTRA', 'happy', 'collage', 'people', 'lives', 'interacting', 'eventually', 'coming', 'together', 'happy', 'ending', 'have', 'Mamie', 'Kudrow', 'who', 'young', 'age', 'was', 'impregnated', 'step-brother', 'Charley', 'Coogan', 'then', ""'ve"", 'had', 'very', 'little', 'contact', 'Charley', 'now', 'closet', 'living', 'boyfriend', 'Gil', 'Sutcliffe', 'best', 'friend', 'Pam', 'Dern', 'lover', 'Diane', 'Clarke', 'have', 'just', 'had', 'son', 'Pam', 'being', 'mother', 'are', 'starting', 'ware', 'Charley', 'sanity', 'Mamie', 'other', 'hand', 'involved', 'massage', 'therapist', 'Javier', 'Cannavale', 'not', 'slightest', 'bit', 'happy', 'life', 'only', 'worse', 'meeting', 'Nicky', 'Bradford', 'who', 'know', 'where', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'one', 'had', 'Charley', 'then', 'gave', 'up', 'adoption', 'reunite', 'circumstance', 'can', 'film', 'documentary', 'submission', 'film', 'school.Then', 'have', 'Jude', 'Gyllenhaal', 'young', 'attractive', 'floozy', 'who', 'band', 'fronted', 'Otis', 'Ritter', 'young', 'boy', 'confused', 'sexuality', 'somewhat', 'obsessed', 'boss', 'Charley', 'Jude', 'fact', 'manipulating', 'have', 'sex', 'order', 'steer', 'father', 'Frank', 'Arnold', 'away', 'speculation', 'homosexuality', 'then', 'using', 'blackmail', 'Otis', 'forcing', 'help', 'hook', 'up', 'father', 'clearly', 'only', 'money', 'loaded', 'upsets', 'Otis', 'idea', 'father', 'condemning', 'sexuality', 'leave', 'choice', 'assist', 'Jude.As', 'stories', 'collide', 'are', 'only', 'drawn', 'character', 'good', 'bad', 'brought', 'understanding', 'what', 'be', 'truly', 'happy', 'end', 'are', 'given', 'one', 'long', 'happy', 'ending', 'showing', 'outcome', 'situations', 'how', 'everyone', 'involved', 'was', 'affected', 'outcome', 'Jude', 'ending', 'pure', 'speculation', 'may', 'distress', 'really', 'made', 'sense', 'Jude', 'was', 'far', 'most', 'engaging', 'interesting', 'character', 'film', 'due', 'part', 'Gyllenhaal', 'brilliant', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'performance', 'have', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'get', 'nothing', 'interaction', 'way', 'satisfied', 'was', 'also', 'most', 'mysterious', 'group', 'intentions', 'where', 'clear', 'what', 'was', 'unclear', 'was', 'motivation.Gyllenhaal', 'did', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'here', 'delivering', 'performance', 'outweighed', 'most', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'definitely', 'deserved', 'awards', 'attention', 'Also', 'Kudrow', 'did', 'wonderful', 'playing', 'type', 'not', 'Wonderland', 'type', 'character', 'still', 'infused', 'comedic', 'timing', 'so', 'well', 'loved', 'just', 'honed', 'more', 'mature', 'comedy', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'are', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'only', 'screen', 'short', 'time', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'always', 'pure', 'delight', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'truly', 'was', 'most', 'satisfying', 'experience', 'one', 'least', ""'ve"", 'had', '2005']",N/A

""Happy Endings"" is a weak entry into the group.Former star of the hit, ensemble cast, television series, ""Friends,"" Lisa Kudrow stars as Mamie, a middle-aged abortion clinic counselor who has, herself, had to decide two decades earlier whether to have an abortion when she and her new step-brother, Charley (Steve Coogan) consummate while she is moving into her new room in her new house.  Mamie decides to have the baby, but gives it up for adoption.  Mamie's life is turned upside down when a wannabe film school student, Nicky (Jesse Bradford) claims to know the name and whereabouts of Mamie's son. Nicky ""blackmails"" Mamie and her boyfriend, a masseuse Javier (Bobby Cannevale) to create a documentary on sex workers so he can be accepted into film school.  Mamie really does not mind because she is a bored, middle-aged woman, and the two convince Nicky that Javier is a sex worker who provides his bored, middle-aged female clients a ""happy ending.""  (A happy ending is an orgasm provided by a masseuse through manual stimulation after their massage, hence the movie title.)  A restaurateur and homosexual, Charley lives with Gil (David Sutcliff).  Charlie believes that the couple's friends, a lesbian couple who, themselves, have had a child misappropriated Gil's sperm in the process.  Otis (Jason Ritter) is an employee of Charley's restaurant.  Otis, too, is a homosexual, has a crush on Charley, and could possibly be Mamie and Charley's long lost son. The third plot line develops when Jude (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a wayward, twenty-something drifter and singer, sleeps with both Otis and his dad, Frank (Tom Arnold) in an effort to cash in big on the wealthy father and son.Sound like fun?  It's not.Although ""Happy Endings"" does provide some witty and clever dialogue, especially through Jude, like when she says to Frank, ""You finally grew some balls, but now it makes your penis look smaller than it already is,"" the movie is generally a mess.  One very annoying attribute the director regularly provides is the half-screen text box to explain parts of the plot to the poor, ignorant audience.  Any film in which the director feels the need to explain what's going on with supplementary text is in danger of being a disaster from the gate.  Yet, there must be at least two dozen of these text boxes throughout the film.The three storylines serially reach their respective climaxes, (no pun intended,) as Mamie discovers her son, Charley and Gil have to face some realities about their own relationship, and Otis, Frank, and Jude sort out their dysfunctional love triangle.  Then, typically, the storylines mesh together and all of the characters find themselves at the same event where they realize just how intertwined their petty little lives have been.  In a way, the director surely hoped to convey, everyone had his or her own version of a happy ending.  However, the audience does not necessarily have to wait until that scene to realized just how much of a waste of time this petty little two-hour film has been.  Even Lisa Kudrow who as shown she can be entertaining in other roles like Laura in ""Analyze This"" really missed her chance to shine as a true female lead.Unless literally everything, literally everything has been rented from the local Blockbuster and all of the independent video stores in a 20-mile radius are also rented out, find something else to do.

938664,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000BB18L8,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","Filmmaker Don Roos brings a unique perspective to his films, and this omnibus 2005 film exemplifies his idiosyncratic style quite well. Even though it doesn't work in its entirety, it has a great ensemble cast and some really sharp observations about a loosely connected group of people who have in common a certain disassociation with the inner truths in their lives.  In fact, the deceptive nature of the characters is the movie's leitmotif, and Roos crosscuts their interactions with helpful title cards that often explain their inner motivations for their actions.There are three basic stories that constitute the film, which recalls the multi-layered, somewhat enervated spirit of Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts"" especially given the LA-based ennui both films portray with accuracy. The first story deals with step-siblings Mamie, who as a teenager, had an affair with her stepbrother Charley that leads to an unwanted pregnancy. Years later, Mamie is ironically an abortion clinic worker, while Charley is gay, partnered contently with Gil for five years and running their long-dead parents' last remaining restaurant. Mamie meets Nicky, a grungy filmmaker who blackmails her into participating in a film about meeting her now-grown-up son whose identity he holds from her. In order to control the spiraling out-of-control situation, Mamie convinces Nicky to make a film instead about her intermittent lover Javier's massage practice and how he has mastered the practice of ""happy endings"", one of the reasons for the movie's title.The second story revolves around Charley's obsession with the paternity of a son which their lesbian best friends have just conceived. He is convinced the son is Gil's which leads to unexpected revelations that backfire on Charley. The third story focuses on Otis, a closeted teenage drummer who works at Charley's restaurant and has a crush on him. Otis meets Jude, a vagabond singer who favors Billy Joel ballads and beds Otis in order to have a place to crash. Once established in the palatial home, she attaches herself to Otis's divorced father Frank, and her deceptions eventually expose themselves. It all sounds complicated and sometimes feels quite erratic, but Roos makes the film intriguing to watch.The acting certainly helps. As Mamie, Lisa Kudrow again shows how she can use her somewhat flaky persona in an arresting way that can be funny and heartbreaking. Steve Coogan effectively brings out Charley's neuroses, while Jesse Bradford is convincingly suspect as Nicky. Laura Dern doesn't really have much to do as one-half of the lesbian couple (Sarah Clarke is the other half), while Bobby Cannavale gamely brings out the swarthy gamesmanship of Javier. Jason Ritter (the look-alike son of the late John Ritter) plays Otis with the right amount of confusion and anxiety. As the bonhomous Jude, Maggie Gyllenhaal (Jake's sister) gives a shrewd performance that never borders on the obvious, while Tom Arnold surprises with a subtle turn as the comparatively innocent Frank.The DVD has an alternate commentary track with Roos, Kudrow and cinematographer Clark Mathis, as well as ten deleted scenes of varying quality and three scenes that constitute the lacking gag reel. During the final film's lengthy 128-minute running time, there are scenes that seem to drift with no reason and character motivations that go unexplained. Regardless, the film is definitely worth seeing.",4,"Multi-Layered Deceptions in LA-Based Ennui  Makes for a Smart, Meandering Hodgepodge",1137974400,"01 23, 2006",2006,3424,"['Filmmaker', 'Don', 'Roos', 'unique', 'perspective', 'films', 'omnibus', '2005', 'film', 'idiosyncratic', 'style', 'quite', 'well', 'Even', ""n't"", 'work', 'entirety', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'really', 'sharp', 'observations', 'loosely', 'connected', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'common', 'certain', 'disassociation', 'inner', 'truths', 'lives', 'fact', 'deceptive', 'nature', 'characters', 'movie', 'leitmotif', 'Roos', 'crosscuts', 'interactions', 'helpful', 'title', 'cards', 'often', 'explain', 'inner', 'motivations', 'actions.There', 'are', 'three', 'basic', 'stories', 'constitute', 'film', 'multi-layered', 'somewhat', 'enervated', 'spirit', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'especially', 'given', 'LA-based', 'ennui', 'films', 'portray', 'accuracy', 'first', 'story', 'deals', 'step-siblings', 'Mamie', 'who', 'teenager', 'had', 'affair', 'stepbrother', 'Charley', 'unwanted', 'pregnancy', 'Years', 'later', 'Mamie', 'ironically', 'abortion', 'clinic', 'worker', 'Charley', 'gay', 'partnered', 'contently', 'Gil', 'five', 'years', 'running', 'long-dead', 'parents', 'last', 'remaining', 'restaurant', 'Mamie', 'Nicky', 'grungy', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'participating', 'film', 'meeting', 'now-grown-up', 'son', 'identity', 'order', 'control', 'spiraling', 'out-of-control', 'situation', 'Mamie', 'Nicky', 'make', 'film', 'instead', 'intermittent', 'lover', 'Javier', 'massage', 'practice', 'how', 'mastered', 'practice', 'happy', 'endings', 'one', 'reasons', 'movie', 'title.The', 'second', 'story', 'revolves', 'Charley', 'obsession', 'paternity', 'son', 'lesbian', 'best', 'friends', 'have', 'just', 'conceived', 'convinced', 'son', 'Gil', 'unexpected', 'revelations', 'backfire', 'Charley', 'third', 'story', 'focuses', 'Otis', 'closeted', 'teenage', 'drummer', 'who', 'Charley', 'restaurant', 'crush', 'Otis', 'Jude', 'vagabond', 'singer', 'who', 'Billy', 'Joel', 'ballads', 'beds', 'Otis', 'order', 'have', 'place', 'crash', 'Once', 'established', 'palatial', 'home', 'Otis', 'divorced', 'father', 'Frank', 'deceptions', 'eventually', 'expose', 'complicated', 'sometimes', 'feels', 'quite', 'erratic', 'Roos', 'film', 'intriguing', 'watch.The', 'acting', 'certainly', 'Mamie', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'again', 'how', 'can', 'use', 'somewhat', 'flaky', 'persona', 'arresting', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'heartbreaking', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'effectively', 'out', 'Charley', 'neuroses', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'convincingly', 'suspect', 'Nicky', 'Laura', 'Dern', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'one-half', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'Sarah', 'Clarke', 'other', 'half', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'gamely', 'out', 'swarthy', 'gamesmanship', 'Javier', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'look-alike', 'son', 'late', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Otis', 'right', 'amount', 'confusion', 'anxiety', 'bonhomous', 'Jude', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jake', 'sister', 'shrewd', 'performance', 'never', 'borders', 'obvious', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'subtle', 'turn', 'comparatively', 'innocent', 'Frank.The', 'DVD', 'alternate', 'commentary', 'track', 'Roos', 'Kudrow', 'cinematographer', 'Clark', 'Mathis', 'as', 'well', 'ten', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'varying', 'quality', 'three', 'scenes', 'constitute', 'lacking', 'gag', 'reel', 'final', 'film', 'lengthy', '128-minute', 'running', 'time', 'are', 'scenes', 'seem', 'drift', 'reason', 'character', 'motivations', 'go', 'unexplained', 'Regardless', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

938666,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BB18L8,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","Writer/director Don Loos has the corner on bizarre, wiggly, frustrating, veritas-infused glimpses at the absurdity of human 'communications/relationships' happening right now.  His previous writings (some with direction credits) include 'The Opposite of Sex', 'Boys on the Side', 'Love Field', and 'Bounce', all of which explore the desperate need for regular people to find just a hint that their time on the planet makes a difference - at least in some small way despite their larger delusions.  His characters are quirky, both bigger than life and pathetically dreary, and cross the lines of the expected borders of types: Roos is one of the few directors who consistently plays the 'minority groups' (gays, lesbians, African Americans, Hispanics, etc) as simply other characters on the playing field of life.  And for that he deserves some respect from everyone.HAPPY ENDINGS (suggestively referring to the ad promise found in masseur/masseuse in the Massage Available columns of magazines and some newspapers!) follows the lives of multiple characters whose rather insignificant existences intersect in random ways that produce ten 'stories', all interrelated.  Topics on the table include abortion, gay relationships, homophobia, parental dysfunction/child dysfunction, emotional manipulation, blackmail, filmmaking, artificial insemination, failed dreams, and more.  Sound like ingredients for a comedy?  Well, no, but in Roos' funky hands these incipient tragic topics weave through tragic trails that result in dark comedy outcomes.  And that is the fun of the film.Yes, there are problems with the movie that others have pointed out well.  The gimmick of sidebars explaining what the script doesn't attack, visible on the half screen with scene change action, begin as clever and end up as annoying: if the script can't carry the issues without footnotes then there is just too much information for the viewer to digest.  What keeps this movie afloat are the performances by Maggie Gyllenhaal, Lisa Kudrow, Jesse Bradford, Bobby Carnavale, Tom Arnold, Steve Coogan, Laura Dern, Sarah Clarke, Jason Ritter, David Sutcliffe and Amanda Foreman.

There is fine ensemble acting by people you didn't know had it in them -- Tom Arnold in particular, who plays a widower in denial about his gay son and who falls hard for Jude, Maggie Gyllenhaal, a drifter who also seduces the gay son and gets pregnant by either father or son.  Which leads her to Lisa Kudrow, Mamie, who years earlier got pregnant by her half-brother, who is now gay, and decided to, but then did not, have an abortion and is now....You get the idea.  The stories connect, break apart, re-connect, and most of the characters are entertaining, confused, good-hearted and caught up in the same kinds of predicaments that most everyone spends their life getting into and -- neatly or messily -- out of.Some reviewers call the Gyllenhaal character unsympathetic and  predatory.  Not so, it is through contact with her that many of the characters start being true to themselves and get set on their path to their personal Happy Ending.  This is made manifest in the touching final scene of the film.Just to counter some of the negative reviews here, I was tempted to give Happy Endings 5 stars, but it's not ambitious enough or original enough for that.

Many of my friends didn't liked the Opposite of Sex; when I asked them why, each confessed a dislike of Lisa Kudrow.  When I noticed she was also in the cast of Happy Endings, and in fact plays one of the main characters, I figured I'd better shut up about mentioning my latest acquisition to some of those friends until I had a chance to watch it.  Watch it I did, and I have nothing but good things to report.Like the Opposite of Sex, Happy Endings revolves around several gay and straight characters, with enough attention paid to both, thus ensuring that the film could appeal to a mixed audience.  There is where all similarities end.  While Opposite of Sex had a relatively up-front and focused plot, Happy Endings manages to juggle several plots and subplots all at once.  Each of the characters lives touch other characters lives in a style not unlike that of director Robert Altman.  In fact, I kept thinking that the pacing and juggling of the subplots was somewhat similar to Short Cuts, or even Crash (in the way that Crash was also compared to Altman's style).  Keeping everyone sorted out in my mind became something of a chore, but I generally like films that make you think and keep you on your toes.  There were one or two surprises, including several totally unexpected plot twists, and that's always good too.  As a comedy I didn't laugh so much as I smiled, and I asked myself more than once, ""I wonder what will happen next"".  As the end credits were rolling I decided I enjoyed my visit with these people, and could easily have managed to sit though even more.  How often do you hear that about a movie that runs over two hours?The cast, which includes Tom Arnold, Jason Ritter and Jesse Bradford give even and professional performances throughout.  It worked in a way that good ensemble pieces always work; that is, it would be difficult to single out any one member of the cast, as they worked off each other in such a way that no one could expect all the notices.  Another good thing, in my book.  I am definitely going to suggest to my friends that they give Don Roos another shot, Lisa Kudrow and all.

938671,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000BB18L8,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","I liked this film because it really was interesting to see how everything got connected. The director and writer Don Roos did a great job with the beginning of the film by immediately grabbing every one's attention! It had so many stories that you had to keep up with and they all did get solved in the end but if you weren't paying attention or thinking then you would have missed one or two of them.While the story is very interesting and does keep the audience focused, by the end I think it runs a little too long. I also think that actually making the movie have a happy ending kind of softened the impact of the film. Another thing that sort of bugs me was the constant written narration borders that kept appearing. It was creative for the first couple of times but after a while, it got annoying and really took the focus off what was happening in the film.The acting however in the film was great although I have to mention a few performances that stood out above the rest and those were Lisa Kudrow, Maggie Gyllenhall, Jesse Bradford and Tom Arnold. Kudrow plays a great serious and deep role. Arnold's character is also very dramatic and convincing. Bradford doesn't play the heartthrob here but the wacky documentary film maker. And Gyllenhall's performance is sleazy and cruel. This is Don Roos third attempt at a feature film, and I think it's probably his best too! It's not a perfect film but it is shot so that you feel the emotions of the characters and feel bad for them at times, and find them amusing at times as well.`Happy Endings' has a terrific story (s), great acting, but it has a few down falls and to me the most disappointing thing about the film was the ending. I think the biggest joke this film could have played on the audience was to make the ending an oxymoron to the films title. But like I said already, it's a good movie to see because the performances are terrific and different then most roles the actors and actresses played beforehand.

938672,AF4UDF0915N34,B000BB18L8,"K. Franklin ""aeternal""","[1, 2]","My 10-Question Film Criteria Applied to Happy Endings:1. Does the plot feel fresh, or is it clich&eacute;d? The main plot is certainly creative. We have a family planning counselor (Lisa Kudrow) who receives a visit from a young aspiring filmmaker (Jesse Bradford) claiming to know her lost son she gave up for adoption. The catch? He wants to blackmail her into making the reunification a documentary. Just in time, Kudrow's ""happy endings"" masseuse (Bobby Cannavale) suggests spinning the documentary into his own risqu&eacute; line of work. The sub-plots basically have general ideas that are given creative elements. Unfortunately, these storylines all get massively hairy--too much so, it seems, for a single film. It might have worked better if each plot were given a single yet powerful layer, then each story wouldn't need such excessive flushing out.2. Does the overall style (structure/cinematography/special effects/other features) work? The film, instead of using the conventional voiceover strategy, opts for side bar narrations designed to produce the same effect. This method can get tricky: it can't be overdone, carrying the weight of the plot and substituting for emotional scenes. Although harder on the eyes than a voiceover, I thought this element was done well. Another feature of Happy Endings is its plot structure of several interweaving storylines (think Magnolia, Happiness, or Love Actually). But because it lacks the absurd dark comedy of Happiness and the emotions found in Magnolia and Love Actually, it ends up being a weak approach stylistically.3. How is the acting? This is one of the most well-casted films I've seen--everyone is convincing. Lisa Kudrow's performance excels the most, but Bradford and Gyllenhaal fall close behind.4. Are the characters engaging? Not really. This is a film that is designed to be about the characters, but ends up being more about the concepts. Kudrow's character Mamie is the only one I really come close to developing an emotional bond to. Everyone else just served their roles.5. Is there a resounding theme? Honesty and deception are themes prevalent in all the storylines. I love how near the beginning Gyllenhaal sings, ""honesty is all I ask of you..."" and then everyone, including our main protagonist, deceives.6. How is the dialogue? Witty yet natural--this is often a hard combination to come by, and it's well-done in this film. A+ dialogue.7. How is the music score/soundtrack?  Excellent. The instrumentals add to the scenes, as do the montage songs. Gillenhall, in the film's band, also throws in a couple classic tunes with some originals.8. How (if applicable) does this compare to the director's other works? I have yet to see Don Roos's  other works, but I hear this is of a lesser quality than the comparable The Opposite of Sex.9. Who is the target audience? Ideal viewers are both open-minded (it deals with homosexual and abortion issues) and patient (it's over two hours). It appeals mostly to an age group of 18-35.10. Would I watch it again? Probably not.",3,A Dark Comedy That's Not So Dark or Comedic,1132790400,"11 24, 2005",2005,3049,"['10-Question', 'Film', 'Criteria', 'Applied', 'Happy', 'Endings:1', 'plot', 'feel', 'fresh', 'clich', 'eacute', 'main', 'plot', 'certainly', 'creative', 'have', 'family', 'planning', 'counselor', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'who', 'visit', 'young', 'aspiring', 'filmmaker', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'claiming', 'know', 'lost', 'son', 'gave', 'up', 'adoption', 'catch', 'blackmail', 'making', 'reunification', 'documentary', 'Just', 'time', 'Kudrow', 'happy', 'endings', 'masseuse', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'spinning', 'documentary', 'own', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'line', 'work', 'sub-plots', 'basically', 'have', 'general', 'ideas', 'are', 'given', 'creative', 'elements', 'Unfortunately', 'storylines', 'get', 'massively', 'hairy', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'single', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'plot', 'were', 'given', 'single', 'yet', 'powerful', 'layer', 'then', 'story', 'would', ""n't"", 'need', 'such', 'excessive', 'flushing', 'out.2', 'overall', 'style', 'structure/cinematography/special', 'effects/other', 'features', 'work', 'film', 'instead', 'using', 'conventional', 'voiceover', 'strategy', 'opts', 'side', 'bar', 'narrations', 'designed', 'produce', 'same', 'effect', 'method', 'can', 'get', 'tricky', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'overdone', 'carrying', 'weight', 'plot', 'substituting', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'harder', 'eyes', 'voiceover', 'thought', 'element', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'feature', 'Happy', 'Endings', 'plot', 'structure', 'several', 'interweaving', 'storylines', 'think', 'Magnolia', 'Happiness', 'Love', 'Actually', 'absurd', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Happiness', 'emotions', 'found', 'Magnolia', 'Love', 'Actually', 'up', 'being', 'weak', 'approach', 'stylistically.3', 'How', 'acting', 'one', 'most', 'well-casted', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'everyone', 'convincing', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'performance', 'most', 'Bradford', 'Gyllenhaal', 'fall', 'close', 'behind.4', 'Are', 'characters', 'engaging', 'Not', 'really', 'film', 'designed', 'be', 'characters', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'concepts', 'Kudrow', 'character', 'Mamie', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'come', 'close', 'developing', 'emotional', 'bond', 'Everyone', 'else', 'just', 'served', 'roles.5', 'there', 'resounding', 'theme', 'Honesty', 'deception', 'are', 'themes', 'prevalent', 'storylines', 'love', 'how', 'beginning', 'Gyllenhaal', 'sings', 'honesty', 'ask', 'then', 'everyone', 'including', 'main', 'protagonist', 'deceives.6', 'How', 'dialogue', 'Witty', 'yet', 'natural', 'often', 'hard', 'combination', 'come', 'well-done', 'film', 'A+', 'dialogue.7', 'How', 'music', 'score/soundtrack', 'Excellent', 'instrumentals', 'add', 'scenes', 'do', 'montage', 'songs', 'Gillenhall', 'film', 'band', 'also', 'couple', 'classic', 'tunes', 'originals.8', 'How', 'applicable', 'compare', 'director', 'other', 'works', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Don', 'Roos', 'other', 'works', 'hear', 'lesser', 'quality', 'comparable', 'Opposite', 'Sex.9', 'Who', 'target', 'audience', 'Ideal', 'viewers', 'are', 'open-minded', 'homosexual', 'abortion', 'issues', 'patient', 'over', 'two', 'hours', 'appeals', 'mostly', 'age', 'group', '18-35.10', 'Would', 'watch', 'again', 'Probably', 'not']",N/A
938673,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000BB18L8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","When Don Roos' ""The Opposite of Sex"" dropped into theaters almost ten years ago, I instantly became a fan. That film featured Christina Ricci's first grown-up character and easily her best and most fully realized performance to date. Wicked and cynical and bitterly funny, it is a film that manages to strike an unusual balance. Taking the coming-of-age genre, turning it upside down with great doses of political incorrectness, but ultimately grounding things with a realness--it is a deft comedy that stands the test of time. Taking a detour with the Paltrow/Affleck weepie ""Bounce,"" Roos fashioned an earnest if not particularly entertaining film. Finally, after a five year hiatus, Roos returns with another film--the coyly titled ""Happy Endings."" An ambitious, and heavily populated, ensemble comedy--""Happy Endings"" may be gentler in spirit than ""The Opposite of Sex,"" but it is no less worthy.In the film's opening moments, a woman is frantically running down the street and is plowed into by a car. The accident appears to be serious, but as we pull away from the wreckage--the film announce itself as a comedy. It's hard not to appreciate that! However, I was still fearful that this was going to be one of those impossibly quirky pictures that people seem to love so much. But I needn't have worried. Telling multiple intersecting stories, ""Happy Endings"" puts together an unlikely cast including Lisa Kudrow, Jesse Bradford, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jason Ritter, Tom Arnold, Laura Dern, Steve Coogan, and Bobby Cannavale (and many others). And while there is a certain preciousness to the film, and while some of the situations seem unlikely or outlandish--the film's contrivances end up be overshadowed by the able cast and genuinely funny script. The characters, even engaged in the most bizarre circumstances, are still grounded in a reality that makes this relationship picture work.For, at heart, ""Happy Endings"" is all about exploring different relationships. Covering plotlines involving abortion, blackmail, golddigging, incest, stolen sperm, prostitution, and sexual variations of all kinds--this film sounds much more distasteful than it actually is. It is within these deviant stories that we uncover the dynamics that make complex relationships work or not. The film's many entanglements include different variations--brother/sister, gay couples, father/son, younger woman/older man, heterosexual couples, counselor/client, and so much more. With smart and funny dialogue and appealing performers, it's hard not to get caught up in the film's ribald spirit.I'm not saying that ""Happy Endings"" is a perfect film, but I admired it's scope. I was fascinated by the various stories--even the ones I didn't particularly believe. The picture wraps itself up fairly neatly--which one might suspect from its title. But overall, I found ""Happy Endings"" to be engaging, witty, and entertaining with some nice dramatic moments sprinkled in with the outrageousness. It's all edited together deftly as you spend just the right amount of time with each story before moving on. Never dull, the intriguing ""Happy Endings"" is definitely worth a look.

A couple of the subjects that Roos addresses here, and as usual his films are rife with the fabric of life's difficulties, life's aliveness, etc, is the subject of children: having them, not having them, worrying about them, hoping the best for them and pining about how they will/do turn out and last but not least it is also about the nature of parenting. On the other hand, ""HE"" is also about the crazy, wonderful process of just living out your life and all that entails. ""HE"" is warm, optimistic and thoughtful. There are no Tri-pods, no Hogwarts, and no Bats. It's complex and simple at the same time...it's about Us.Roos has mellowed considerably over the last several years as most of us have or will. This movie is more emotionally naked and available than ""The Opposite of Sex."" But Roos' trademark sardonic, dark humor is without a doubt still a big part of what makes his films special and this film is brimming over with it. Case in point: the character of Jude played to the hilt by Maggie Gyllenhaal: she's a gold-digger with scruples...sad and wan a lot of the time but hopeful and, unlike most of the other characters, grounded with a world-wise savvy that belies her young age. Jude is human spark-someone that lights up a room when she enters, someone that can always make you smile. Jude is not any smarter than the rest of the great cast: she's just more open and real and holds nothing back. She wears her heart on her sleeve and her sleeve is smudged with the detritus of living.Lisa Kudrow as a Family Planning Counselor, Mamie is also a revelation. Gone is the brittleness of her character in ""The Opposite of Sex, "" and she has replaced it with a vulnerability, a wariness of life. Mamie has lived some and she is often scared, often unable to make a decision. Kudrow's performance is warm, thoughtful and emotionally real and approachable.Everyone in this film makes big, turn-your-life-around mistakes but Roos issues no judgments whatsoever. He is the observer, the presenter of the facts: he shows us...he does not tell us.Not everyone in ""Happy Endings"" ends up happy. Some end up sadder but smarter...others somewhere in-between.

Gyllenhaal and Kudrow do the best with what they are given to work with, and I wish that both of them had more screen time...although maybe Gyllenhaal could have been limited to singing just one tune in her 'poor man's Natalie Merchant' style.This film just never really gets off the ground.

I'd say the story line about the lesbian couple working on having a child that might or might not be the offspring of one partner in a male couple feels just a little contrived and a bit uninteresting.  That's a bit of shame, because the result is that Laura Dern is wasted.The primary ""plot"" deals with Lisa Kudrow's character, who gave up a child for adoption as a teenager, and is now confronted with the possibility of knowing what happened to her child...but in order to do so, she must work with a blackmailing documentary filmmaker wannabe.  Confusing?  Well, it's not confusing when you watch it, but it also doesn't make much sense.  She becomes interested in both the making of a documentary and the loony-tunes filmmaker himself.  The way this film progreses and the work they do on it is not constructed very convincingly...and while I REALLY like the work Lisa Kudrow does, this plot point was meandering at best.But the performances ARE very lively and convincing for the most part.  Kudrow is very good indeed, as is Maggie Gylenhaal.  And I want to give kudos to Tom Arnold.  This man is often thought of as a mere bozo or an idiot, and he has indeed played that part in many awful movies.  But once in awhile, he does something to make me wish more directors would give him more to work with.  TRUE LIES was a great movie that he nearly stole.  And in HAPPY ENDINGS, he plays something kinda rare...a well-to-do middle-aged white man who is actually a decent person.  And he pulls it off.  Arnold has an air of humbleness to him that he incorporates well into his part.  I certainly haven't approved of much of his public behavior, but his problems have molded the things he can draw on as an actor, and they served him well.Bobby Cannavale is a fun actor, but his part is very underwritten.  I REALLY liked him in THE STATION AGENT (a must see).  Steve Coogan's role is also written a bit broadly, but he does a fine job nonetheless.See it for the acting, and a few affecting moments.  But if you want taught construction, an effective resolution, deeper meaning, you'll be disappointed.

938682,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,B000BB18L8,Thayer,"[0, 0]","At the beginning of the movie when one of the main characters was hit by a car and it looked like she was killed, the audience was reminded instantly through the amusing use of captions that appear constantly through out the film, that she was not dead and assured us that the film would stand by its promise of happy endings. We are then directed to the events that preceded that opening scene and introduced all the main characters.The movie has self contained multiple stories that intersect fleetingly sometimes producing significant outcomes for the main characters. The weightiest story belongs to Lisa Kudrow's Mamie. Her character had an affair with her stepbrother when she was a teenager mainly just out of rebellion to her mother. She got pregnant and had an abortion, or did she? Years later someone who claimed to know the whereabouts of her son tried to blackmail her into filming the whole reunion in his documentary. Lisa Kudrow gave an ace performance. She was funny in a few scenes but as whole it was a heartbreaking performance.The next storyline involves a father (Arnold) and son (Ritter) being conned by Gyllenhaal. She knows that Ritter is gay and use it to conveniently seduce his father. This is probably the funniest among the three major storylines. Tom Arnold was surprisingly good but Gyllenhaal commands the screen with her performance. And may I add that she sings in this movie and she has a lovely jazzy voice.The last storyline is the least successful because it's not exactly as funny as the second storyline but also not as moving as the first one. Steve Coogan and David Sutcliffe (Christopher in Gilmore Girls) are a gay couple who suspect that their friend Laura Dern used Sutcliffe's sperm (from a bank) without their knowledge.I am fascinated with the complexity of some of the characters particularly Mamie. Based on her teenage past, you wouldn't guess that she'd become the boring and lifeless person that she had become. One of the characters even accused her of enjoying being blackmailed and basically being in the mess that she was in because that's the most exciting thing that has happened to her life. Another fascinating character is the one played by Tom Arnold. He seems sleazy and dreadful at first but in the end, he is anything but that. He really loves his son and he treats his relationships with sincerity.And now back to the ending, the title of the movie created high expectations on how the movie would end. And I must say I am very pleased with the result. After quickly showing what happened to all the characters, the movie ended with Mamie's wedding reception. As she was dancing with her stepbrother, everyone that led her to that very moment, whether good or bad, appeared in her imagination one by one. It was a beautiful heartwarming ending.Grade: A-",5,Happy Endings,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,2822,"['beginning', 'movie', 'when', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'hit', 'car', 'looked', 'was', 'killed', 'audience', 'was', 'reminded', 'instantly', 'amusing', 'use', 'captions', 'appear', 'constantly', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'dead', 'assured', 'film', 'would', 'stand', 'promise', 'happy', 'endings', 'are', 'then', 'directed', 'events', 'preceded', 'opening', 'scene', 'introduced', 'main', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'self', 'contained', 'multiple', 'stories', 'intersect', 'fleetingly', 'sometimes', 'producing', 'significant', 'outcomes', 'main', 'characters', 'weightiest', 'story', 'belongs', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Mamie', 'character', 'had', 'affair', 'stepbrother', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'mainly', 'just', 'rebellion', 'mother', 'got', 'pregnant', 'had', 'abortion', 'did', 'Years', 'later', 'someone', 'who', 'claimed', 'know', 'whereabouts', 'son', 'tried', 'blackmail', 'filming', 'whole', 'reunion', 'documentary', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'gave', 'ace', 'performance', 'was', 'funny', 'few', 'scenes', 'whole', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'performance.The', 'next', 'storyline', 'father', 'Arnold', 'son', 'Ritter', 'being', 'conned', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Ritter', 'gay', 'use', 'conveniently', 'seduce', 'father', 'probably', 'funniest', 'three', 'major', 'storylines', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Gyllenhaal', 'screen', 'performance', 'may', 'add', 'movie', 'lovely', 'jazzy', 'voice.The', 'last', 'storyline', 'least', 'successful', 'not', 'exactly', 'as', 'funny', 'second', 'storyline', 'also', 'not', 'as', 'moving', 'first', 'one', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'David', 'Sutcliffe', 'Christopher', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'are', 'gay', 'couple', 'who', 'suspect', 'friend', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'used', 'Sutcliffe', 'sperm', 'bank', 'knowledge.I', 'am', 'fascinated', 'complexity', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Mamie', 'Based', 'teenage', 'past', 'would', ""n't"", 'guess', ""'d"", 'become', 'boring', 'lifeless', 'person', 'had', 'become', 'One', 'characters', 'even', 'accused', 'enjoying', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'basically', 'being', 'mess', 'was', 'most', 'exciting', 'thing', 'happened', 'life', 'fascinating', 'character', 'one', 'played', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'sleazy', 'dreadful', 'first', 'end', 'anything', 'really', 'son', 'relationships', 'sincerity.And', 'now', 'back', 'ending', 'title', 'movie', 'created', 'high', 'expectations', 'how', 'movie', 'would', 'end', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'result', 'quickly', 'showing', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'movie', 'ended', 'Mamie', 'wedding', 'reception', 'was', 'dancing', 'stepbrother', 'everyone', 'led', 'very', 'moment', 'good', 'bad', 'appeared', 'imagination', 'one', 'one', 'was', 'beautiful', 'heartwarming', 'ending.Grade', 'A-']",N/A

May include spoilers, but the intent is to show the complexity and confusion.This film runs with three subplots that stay disconnected for too long. Charley (Steve Coogan) and Mamie (Lisa Kudrow) are step siblings who have a child together, except Charley thinks it was aborted. The child was put up for adoption. Oh yeah, Charley is gay and Mamie is having an affair with her masseuse. Charley believes his partner Gil (David Sutcliffe) is the biological father of  the child of a lesbian couple through sperm he had donated. A bad independent film maker (Jesse Bradford) convinces Mamie to go look for her son so he can film it, even though the son doesn't want to be found. Meanwhile Otis (Jason Ritter) rich son of Tom Arnold is gay...he thinks, but scores with Jude (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who also sleeps with dad, and becomes pregnant seeking the advice of Mamie who works at the clinic.The film attempts to be clever with printed material to the side, the way VH-1 tries to be clever with &#34;Pop Up Videos&#34; except VH-1 is better. The writers try to be funny with dysfunctional people in unusual relationships, but fails due to the complexity of the plot. They should have made Otis the son of Mamie and Charley in order to bring this full circle, but for some reason overlooked the obvious.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Lisa Kudrow, Tamara Davies )",2,NO ONE DIES IN THIS MOVIE,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,1377,"['Basic', 'Plot', 'May', 'include', 'spoilers', 'intent', 'show', 'complexity', 'confusion.This', 'film', 'runs', 'three', 'subplots', 'stay', 'disconnected', 'too', 'long', 'Charley', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'Mamie', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'are', 'step', 'siblings', 'who', 'have', 'child', 'together', 'Charley', 'was', 'aborted', 'child', 'was', 'put', 'up', 'adoption', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Charley', 'gay', 'Mamie', 'having', 'affair', 'masseuse', 'Charley', 'partner', 'Gil', 'David', 'Sutcliffe', 'biological', 'father', 'child', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'sperm', 'had', 'donated', 'bad', 'independent', 'film', 'maker', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'Mamie', 'go', 'look', 'son', 'can', 'film', 'even', 'son', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'found', 'Meanwhile', 'Otis', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'rich', 'son', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'gay', 'Jude', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'also', 'sleeps', 'dad', 'pregnant', 'seeking', 'advice', 'Mamie', 'who', 'clinic.The', 'film', 'attempts', 'be', 'clever', 'printed', 'material', 'side', 'way', 'VH-1', 'tries', 'be', 'clever', '34', 'Pop', 'Up', 'Videos', '34', 'VH-1', 'better', 'writers', 'try', 'be', 'funny', 'dysfunctional', 'people', 'unusual', 'relationships', 'fails', 'due', 'complexity', 'plot', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'Otis', 'son', 'Mamie', 'Charley', 'order', 'bring', 'full', 'circle', 'reason', 'overlooked', 'obvious.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Tamara', 'Davies']",N/A

And those endings might just turn out to be happy in ways you never could have foreseen. That may be the message of Don Roos' recent film Happy Endings, a very original story that follows the lives of eight or ten characters as they intersect in highly unpredictable ways. The film opens with a woman running as fast as she can down a side street, and then suddenly getting hit by a car (though a text caption immediately reassures us that she'll be okay). The rest of the film is no more predictable than that, as we meet an intriguing cast of characters: a step-brother and step-sister who have a brief romantic liaison, a film-maker wannabe who performs blackmail at gunpoint in order to help get himself into film school, a masseur with a few secrets, a gay couple and their lesbian friends whose child one of the men may have fathered unknowingly, and a closeted gay drummer in a rock band who sleeps with a girl who then dumps him for his father. Like Roos' previous film, The Opposite of Sex, the story is unlike anything you've seen before, and following its twists and turns keeps you hooked wondering where it will go next. In getting the large number of primary characters quickly introduced, Roos uses the gimmick of text captions that cut in on the side. These aren't regular subtitles, but more like silent movie captions, except that they're done in split-screen alongside the image. It's a bit visually distracting at times, but the sardonic tone of the captions helps set the film's attitude. This film is closer to real life than most in that all of its characters are partly functional and partly dysfunctional, all flawed but all human. Roos has put together a great ensemble cast, successfully putting a number of known actors outside their usual ""types"". Lisa Kudrow is spot-on as a Mamie, who has some funny lines but is a hardened character with solid dramatic moments. Tom Arnold is excellent in playing a character that is neither funny nor loud, as he sensitively portrays a man quietly recovering his life after his wife's death. Bobby Cannavale plays a Mexican immigrant (with no trace of his heavy New York accent from Will and Grace), while Jesse Bradford plays a ruthless reprobate with artful aspirations. British comic actor Steve Coogan is also spendid in a dramatic role here. And relative newcomer Jason Ritter does a great job playing the clueless closeted rock-band drummer. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a bad girl who sometimes has a heart, and she keeps it all very real. The film has just enough witty lines and cleverly wrought situations to keep it from being too serious, but there's a lot of great dramatic character interplay, and this film just might get you thinking about adoption versus abortion. But if so, that just happens along the romping ride.",4,A fun quirky unpredictable romp,1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,2911,"['ca', ""n't"", 'often', 'get', 'happy', 'endings', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'live', 'life', 'endings', 'end', 'up', 'endings', 'might', 'just', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'happy', 'ways', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'foreseen', 'may', 'be', 'message', 'Don', 'Roos', 'recent', 'film', 'Happy', 'Endings', 'very', 'original', 'story', 'lives', 'eight', 'ten', 'characters', 'intersect', 'highly', 'unpredictable', 'ways', 'film', 'woman', 'running', 'as', 'fast', 'can', 'down', 'side', 'street', 'then', 'suddenly', 'getting', 'hit', 'car', 'text', 'caption', 'immediately', ""'ll"", 'be', 'okay', 'rest', 'film', 'more', 'predictable', 'meet', 'intriguing', 'cast', 'characters', 'step-brother', 'step-sister', 'who', 'have', 'brief', 'romantic', 'liaison', 'film-maker', 'wannabe', 'who', 'blackmail', 'gunpoint', 'order', 'help', 'get', 'film', 'school', 'masseur', 'few', 'secrets', 'gay', 'couple', 'lesbian', 'friends', 'child', 'one', 'men', 'may', 'have', 'fathered', 'unknowingly', 'closeted', 'gay', 'drummer', 'rock', 'band', 'who', 'girl', 'who', 'then', 'father', 'Roos', 'previous', 'film', 'Opposite', 'Sex', 'story', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'following', 'twists', 'keeps', 'hooked', 'wondering', 'where', 'will', 'go', 'next', 'getting', 'large', 'number', 'primary', 'characters', 'quickly', 'introduced', 'Roos', 'gimmick', 'text', 'captions', 'cut', 'side', 'are', ""n't"", 'regular', 'subtitles', 'more', 'silent', 'movie', 'captions', ""'re"", 'done', 'split-screen', 'image', 'bit', 'visually', 'distracting', 'times', 'sardonic', 'tone', 'captions', 'set', 'film', 'attitude', 'film', 'closer', 'real', 'life', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'partly', 'functional', 'partly', 'dysfunctional', 'flawed', 'human', 'Roos', 'put', 'together', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'successfully', 'putting', 'number', 'known', 'actors', 'usual', 'types', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'spot-on', 'Mamie', 'who', 'funny', 'lines', 'hardened', 'character', 'solid', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'excellent', 'playing', 'character', 'funny', 'loud', 'sensitively', 'man', 'quietly', 'recovering', 'life', 'wife', 'death', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'Mexican', 'immigrant', 'trace', 'heavy', 'New', 'York', 'accent', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'ruthless', 'reprobate', 'artful', 'aspirations', 'British', 'comic', 'actor', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'also', 'spendid', 'dramatic', 'role', 'here', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'clueless', 'closeted', 'rock-band', 'drummer', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'bad', 'girl', 'who', 'heart', 'very', 'real', 'film', 'just', 'enough', 'witty', 'lines', 'cleverly', 'wrought', 'situations', 'keep', 'being', 'too', 'serious', 'lot', 'great', 'dramatic', 'character', 'interplay', 'film', 'just', 'might', 'get', 'thinking', 'adoption', 'versus', 'abortion', 'so', 'just', 'romping', 'ride']",N/A

This movie tried to reach that artistic note but came off as pretentious and vulgar.The story line is weak. It tried to be clever and filled with witwhich made it embarassing.
