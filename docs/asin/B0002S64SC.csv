Why do we, as fellow humans, find it so facinating just to see people grow older and hear about all their trails and tribulations? Maybe because it shows us the essence of LIFE, and thus ourselves. I can not recommend this DVD-set highly enough. It transcends the borders of British culture for which it was initially made. I do hope with all my heart that all the participants will return to this project in the future (56 UP onwards) because, sadly, this series must eventually end.

Usually, he shows no real understanding of the role good writing plays in filmmaking, and routinely praises the use of clich&eacute;s, such as the tripe of Steven Spielberg and other Hollywood fare. However, when he declared The Up Series of documentary films, by Michael Apted, now out on DVD, `an inspired, almost noble use of the film medium, Apted penetrates to the central mystery of life', I not only concur, but almost forgive him for recommending Saving Private Ryan. I said almost, now.It was in the late 1980s, on PBS, in America, I first became acquainted with Apted's wonderful Up documentary film series, in which, over the course of their lives, he has followed fourteen British citizens at seven year intervals. Apted, a mainstream director of such films as Coal Miner's Daughter (1980), Gorillas In The Mist (1988), Thunderheart (1992), Nell (1994), The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Enough (2002), has made The Up Series his filmic legacy. The films are dedicated to a Jesuit maxim, `Give me the child until he is seven and I will give you the man', variously attributed to Francis Xavier, St. Ignatius of Loyola, and others. The film I first saw was 28 Up, released in 1985, although filmed in 1984. I was intrigued by the usage of footage from earlier films in the series contrasted with the contemporarily filmed scenes. I did not think about the films again until a decade later, when I saw 42 Up in 1999, released theatrically in America. All the films air on television in the U.K. This was `reality television' long before the term was bastardized by the faux melodramas of today, and far more insightful than the web cam voyeurism of the early Internet.The Up Series is one of the great works of humanity, where two of our greatest pursuits- art and science- meet, as well as being that rare synergy, where the body of films are far more than their added individual value. You come to like and respect all of these people- even the rich snobs, for the films force the viewers to question themselves and all about, and in each of the subjects, including Apted, bits of ourselves can be seen, whether it's the good stuff that the boldest of the subjects or moments contain, or the pettiness and flaws. Having recently been visited by my seven year old niece, and recalling an audio tape I made on Christmas Day, 1972, when I was seven, the films have taken on a special cogency to me. Your cogencies will be different, although just as special. So is The Up Series.",5,Great,1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,2586,"['rare', 'synchronicity', 'agreement', 'American', 'pop', 'film', 'critic', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'Usually', 'real', 'understanding', 'role', 'good', 'writing', 'plays', 'filmmaking', 'routinely', 'use', 'clich', 'eacute', 'such', 'tripe', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'However', 'when', 'declared', 'Up', 'Series', 'documentary', 'films', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'now', 'out', 'DVD', 'inspired', 'almost', 'noble', 'use', 'film', 'medium', 'Apted', 'central', 'mystery', 'life', 'not', 'only', 'concur', 'almost', 'forgive', 'recommending', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'said', 'almost', 'now.It', 'was', 'late', '1980s', 'PBS', 'America', 'first', 'became', 'acquainted', 'Apted', 'wonderful', 'Up', 'documentary', 'film', 'series', 'course', 'lives', 'followed', 'fourteen', 'British', 'citizens', 'seven', 'year', 'intervals', 'Apted', 'mainstream', 'director', 'such', 'films', 'Coal', 'Miner', 'Daughter', '1980', 'Gorillas', 'Mist', '1988', 'Thunderheart', '1992', 'Nell', '1994', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', '1999', 'Enough', '2002', 'made', 'Up', 'Series', 'filmic', 'legacy', 'films', 'are', 'dedicated', 'Jesuit', 'maxim', 'Give', 'child', 'seven', 'will', 'give', 'man', 'variously', 'attributed', 'Francis', 'Xavier', 'St.', 'Ignatius', 'Loyola', 'others', 'film', 'first', 'saw', 'was', '28', 'Up', 'released', '1985', 'filmed', '1984', 'was', 'intrigued', 'usage', 'footage', 'earlier', 'films', 'series', 'contrasted', 'contemporarily', 'filmed', 'scenes', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'films', 'again', 'decade', 'later', 'when', 'saw', '42', 'Up', '1999', 'released', 'theatrically', 'America', 'films', 'air', 'television', 'U.K', 'was', 'reality', 'television', 'long', 'term', 'was', 'bastardized', 'faux', 'melodramas', 'today', 'far', 'more', 'insightful', 'web', 'cam', 'voyeurism', 'early', 'Internet.The', 'Up', 'Series', 'one', 'great', 'works', 'humanity', 'where', 'two', 'greatest', 'pursuits-', 'art', 'science-', 'meet', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'rare', 'synergy', 'where', 'body', 'films', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'added', 'individual', 'value', 'come', 'like', 'respect', 'people-', 'even', 'rich', 'snobs', 'films', 'force', 'viewers', 'question', 'subjects', 'including', 'Apted', 'bits', 'ourselves', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'good', 'stuff', 'boldest', 'subjects', 'moments', 'contain', 'pettiness', 'flaws', 'Having', 'recently', 'been', 'visited', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'niece', 'recalling', 'audio', 'tape', 'made', 'Christmas', 'Day', '1972', 'when', 'was', 'seven', 'films', 'have', 'taken', 'special', 'cogency', 'cogencies', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'just', 'special', 'Up', 'Series']",N/A

It's a completely mesmerizing experience, following these 14 people from childhood to middle age (so far). It's sociology, psychology and soap opera rolled into one great series. Having not seen any of the films in the theater, and experiencing them in real time, I can only reflect on what it is like to watch all 7 in a space of three weeks.Since Michael Apted must be well along in years (his subjects, seven at the time of the first movie, are hitting 50 this year); I just hope that someone will continue the series through the subjects' lives after Apted cannot.Apted originally began the series as a study of class limitations in England; obviously in 1964 there was no way to know what was coming--the sexual revolution, feminism, youth culture, etc. By picking children born in 1957, he inadvertently chose a group that missed the '60s, and came of age in the post-Vietnam world. Interestingly, the children he chose have (mostly) stayed within the lines of the British class structure they were born into, and have (mostly) made the best and the most of the cards they were dealt.The result is a transcendent experience for the viewer: we learn that what cynics call ""living lives of quiet desperation"" is really living lives of quiet nobility.",5,The Phenomenon that is Up,1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,1332,"['Michael', 'Apted', 'Up', 'series', 'everything', 'good', 'everyone', 'ever', 'said', 'completely', 'mesmerizing', 'experience', 'following', '14', 'people', 'childhood', 'middle', 'age', 'so', 'far', 'sociology', 'psychology', 'soap', 'opera', 'rolled', 'one', 'great', 'series', 'Having', 'not', 'seen', 'films', 'theater', 'experiencing', 'real', 'time', 'can', 'only', 'reflect', 'what', 'watch', '7', 'space', 'three', 'weeks.Since', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'must', 'be', 'well', 'along', 'years', 'subjects', 'seven', 'time', 'first', 'movie', 'are', 'hitting', '50', 'year', 'just', 'hope', 'someone', 'will', 'continue', 'series', 'subjects', 'lives', 'Apted', 'can', 'not', '.Apted', 'originally', 'began', 'series', 'study', 'class', 'limitations', 'England', 'obviously', '1964', 'was', 'way', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'feminism', 'youth', 'culture', 'etc', 'picking', 'children', 'born', '1957', 'inadvertently', 'chose', 'group', 'missed', ""'60s"", 'came', 'age', 'post-Vietnam', 'world', 'Interestingly', 'children', 'chose', 'have', 'mostly', 'stayed', 'lines', 'British', 'class', 'structure', 'were', 'born', 'have', 'mostly', 'made', 'best', 'most', 'cards', 'were', 'dealt.The', 'result', 'transcendent', 'experience', 'viewer', 'learn', 'what', 'cynics', 'call', 'living', 'lives', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'really', 'living', 'lives', 'quiet', 'nobility']",N/A

Many of the children had a sense of their futures by the time they were 7 years old - and most of them were eerily on target, in spite of whatever their parents tried to do to change their beliefs. Extroverts, for the most part, stayed extroverts and the shy types never became social butterflies.

At the time I purchased that was the mosteconomic option. (also, I read that the new 7-49 complete setforces the early 4:3 episodes into 1:78, thus somewhat reframingthe original images).While I could quibble, wishing for a bit more depth here and there(especially with the women, where there's a bit too much emphasison love and marriage at the expense of all else), it's really an astounding,moving, frightening and uplifting document. There's no way to watchthis remarkable series of films without reflecting deeply on one's ownlife, and how you have changed (and stayed the same) over your ownlifetime.While Michael Aped deserves every bit of credit he's received for thisamazing piece of cultural anthropology, it's important to note the first film,7 Up,was actually directed by Paul Almond, and Apted was a that point aresearcher for the project.",5,Unique and amazing series of films,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,1181,"[""'Up"", 'Series', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'unusual', 'usesof', 'film', 'cinema', 'history', 'documentary', 'life-long', 'chronicle', 'thelives', '14', 'people', 'starting', '7', 'years', 'old', 'revisiting', 'sevenyears', 'age', '49', 'so', 'far', '.This', 'set', 'films', 'age', '42', 'Up', 'needingto', 'be', 'bought', 'separately', 'time', 'purchased', 'was', 'mosteconomic', 'option', 'also', 'read', 'new', '7-49', 'complete', 'setforces', 'early', '4:3', 'episodes', '1:78', 'thus', 'somewhat', 'reframingthe', 'original', 'images', '.While', 'could', 'quibble', 'wishing', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'here', 'there', 'especially', 'women', 'where', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'emphasison', 'love', 'marriage', 'expense', 'else', 'really', 'astounding', 'moving', 'frightening', 'uplifting', 'document', 'way', 'watchthis', 'remarkable', 'series', 'films', 'reflecting', 'deeply', 'one', 'ownlife', 'how', 'have', 'changed', 'stayed', 'same', 'ownlifetime.While', 'Michael', 'Aped', 'bit', 'credit', 'received', 'thisamazing', 'piece', 'cultural', 'anthropology', 'important', 'note', 'first', 'film,7', 'Up', 'was', 'actually', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Almond', 'Apted', 'was', 'point', 'aresearcher', 'project']",N/A

But the bottom line for me is if I enjoy watching the program, and I don't.Maybe it's the dryness of the interviewing.  Maybe a different person, a more creative person, would have breathed more life into the series.  It would be hard for me to imagine anyone doing a dryer or more boring job of it.So while almost all of the other reviewers applaud what we see here, I have to say it was not done well.

844139,A10CVKXWJZENY6,B0002S64SC,RB,"[24, 26]","As some others have commented here, the answer to the question ""is this really worthwhile for the money? etc"" is ""yes,"" at least assuming that you are willing to commit the time to watching it, which you really should. The description and other reviews have already covered the main idea and many of the highlights. I'll just add a bit from my perspective, for what it may be worth to anyone, with the points in no particular order.35 UP does in fact seem rather lackluster compared to the others, as I believe someone mentioned. Not sure why. Maybe that age is just typically less interesting in the average life? Maybe in part because it lacks both not only Charles, who dropped out at 21 (and it must be said that I would also pay a lot to find out why he doesn't do the series anymore), but also Symon (called the heart & soul of 14, at least, on the commentary track on 42, when he returns) and, sadly, Peter (who on the same commentary, it is revealed, was basically bullied out by the rigid and overzealous press after some comments he made on 28 that were not to their liking). It is helpful (if not exactly always nice) to see John again, and since he doesn't appear in 42 and didn't appear in 28, either, this is the one chance to get some continuity in terms of his presence. So these absences may create some of that effect, but like in some other parts of the series, it is well worth going through the somewhat slower parts to continue on with the whole effort.Features: It seems a very unfortunate thing that there are no subtitles -- not even English captions -- on any of the discs. To go to all the trouble to produce and market them and to leave out this one feature, especially in light of the facts that(1) the series is internationally popular (at least according to several comments Apted makes on the commentary to 42)(2) the subpar sound quality on the earlier films,(3) the combination of particular English accents and the fact that children are speaking them on the earlier films, and perhaps most notably(4) the existence of transcripts for the material already (as Apted comments on 42).I can see no reason why English captions, at least, if not also subtitles in other languages, were left off, as that seems to be a feature even on much less important run of the mill films released on DVD. The result is that you do really have to be committed to some ongoing vagueness in the early going in order to get the more rewarding material later.49 UP and beyond: Some have said they hope there will be no more installments because it's boring by this point but it's really difficult to come out with that feeling, I think, if you are really willing to accept the premise and character of the project. Actually the original premise -- to uncover and emphasize the (presumably ugly) importance of the class system in Britain in particular and its effect on people from a very early age -- is often confounded along the way for various reasons, and as has been noted, the real objective turns out to be just the projection over time of the whole maturation process of a human being, which by no means ends upon arrival at adulthood around 20 or so. It's all about that projection; whether these people are in any way ""typical"" or not is really not very relevant, and whether some stages of their lives are less exciting or not is also not so relevant, even if it can affect the viewer's enjoyment of certain parts of the film. It may also help to view them in this release all together, as Apted himself recommends in his commentary, and to remember if you feel there is too much repetition that of course they were viewed 7 years apart all throughout the history of the project, otherwise.In the end you really have to admire the work of Apted and his crew on this, and as he frequently points out, the willingness on the part of the various subjects to open themselves up -- sometimes in remarkably revealing ways that leave them quite vulnerable -- to him and the cameras and thus the whole world beyond that. Roger Ebert's description of it as noble and a courageous use of the medium rings very true after you see it. And if there are some parts that are slower or some complaints about the final package, well that's also how life is and is no reason to diminish the overall success of this very ambitious work.",5,Yes it's worth it,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,4341,"['others', 'have', 'commented', 'here', 'answer', 'question', 'really', 'worthwhile', 'money', 'etc', 'yes', 'least', 'assuming', 'are', 'willing', 'commit', 'time', 'watching', 'really', 'should', 'description', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'already', 'covered', 'main', 'idea', 'many', 'highlights', ""'ll"", 'just', 'add', 'bit', 'perspective', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'worth', 'anyone', 'points', 'particular', 'order.35', 'UP', 'fact', 'seem', 'rather', 'lackluster', 'compared', 'others', 'believe', 'someone', 'mentioned', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'Maybe', 'age', 'just', 'typically', 'less', 'interesting', 'average', 'life', 'Maybe', 'part', 'not', 'only', 'Charles', 'who', 'dropped', 'out', '21', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'would', 'also', 'pay', 'lot', 'find', 'out', 'why', ""n't"", 'do', 'series', 'anymore', 'also', 'Symon', 'called', 'heart', 'soul', '14', 'least', 'commentary', 'track', '42', 'when', 'sadly', 'Peter', 'who', 'same', 'commentary', 'revealed', 'was', 'basically', 'bullied', 'out', 'rigid', 'overzealous', 'press', 'comments', 'made', '28', 'were', 'not', 'liking', 'helpful', 'not', 'exactly', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'John', 'again', ""n't"", 'appear', '42', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', '28', 'either', 'one', 'chance', 'get', 'continuity', 'terms', 'presence', 'absences', 'may', 'create', 'effect', 'other', 'parts', 'series', 'well', 'worth', 'going', 'somewhat', 'slower', 'parts', 'continue', 'whole', 'effort.Features', 'very', 'unfortunate', 'thing', 'are', 'subtitles', 'not', 'even', 'English', 'captions', 'discs', 'go', 'trouble', 'produce', 'market', 'leave', 'out', 'one', 'feature', 'especially', 'light', 'facts', '1', 'series', 'internationally', 'popular', 'least', 'according', 'several', 'comments', 'Apted', 'commentary', '42', '2', 'subpar', 'sound', 'quality', 'earlier', 'films', '3', 'combination', 'particular', 'English', 'accents', 'fact', 'children', 'are', 'speaking', 'earlier', 'films', 'perhaps', 'most', 'notably', '4', 'existence', 'transcripts', 'material', 'already', 'Apted', 'comments', '42', '.I', 'can', 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'English', 'captions', 'least', 'not', 'also', 'subtitles', 'other', 'languages', 'were', 'left', 'off', 'be', 'feature', 'even', 'much', 'less', 'important', 'run', 'mill', 'films', 'released', 'DVD', 'result', 'do', 'really', 'have', 'be', 'committed', 'ongoing', 'vagueness', 'early', 'going', 'order', 'get', 'more', 'rewarding', 'material', 'later.49', 'UP', 'have', 'said', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'installments', 'boring', 'point', 'really', 'difficult', 'come', 'out', 'feeling', 'think', 'are', 'really', 'willing', 'accept', 'premise', 'character', 'project', 'Actually', 'original', 'premise', 'uncover', 'emphasize', 'presumably', 'ugly', 'importance', 'class', 'system', 'Britain', 'particular', 'effect', 'people', 'very', 'early', 'age', 'often', 'confounded', 'way', 'various', 'reasons', 'been', 'noted', 'real', 'objective', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'projection', 'time', 'whole', 'maturation', 'process', 'human', 'being', 'means', 'arrival', 'adulthood', 'around', '20', 'so', 'projection', 'people', 'are', 'way', 'typical', 'not', 'really', 'not', 'very', 'relevant', 'stages', 'lives', 'are', 'less', 'exciting', 'not', 'also', 'not', 'so', 'relevant', 'even', 'can', 'affect', 'viewer', 'enjoyment', 'certain', 'parts', 'film', 'may', 'also', 'help', 'view', 'release', 'together', 'Apted', 'commentary', 'remember', 'feel', 'too', 'much', 'repetition', 'course', 'were', 'viewed', '7', 'years', 'apart', 'history', 'project', 'end', 'really', 'have', 'admire', 'work', 'Apted', 'crew', 'frequently', 'out', 'willingness', 'part', 'various', 'subjects', 'open', 'up', 'sometimes', 'remarkably', 'revealing', 'ways', 'leave', 'quite', 'vulnerable', 'cameras', 'thus', 'whole', 'world', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'description', 'noble', 'courageous', 'use', 'medium', 'very', 'true', 'see', 'are', 'parts', 'are', 'slower', 'complaints', 'final', 'package', 'well', 'also', 'how', 'life', 'reason', 'diminish', 'overall', 'success', 'very', 'ambitious', 'work']",N/A
844140,A2J2SJ6BH9OX9T,B0002S64SC,"R. Harris ""Movie Buff""","[5, 5]","The complete Up Series (7 Up to 56 Up). First Run Features did a great job in the transfer of all eight films and their soundtracks except for the audio for 56 Up. I heard a minor, random snapping sound on my copy so I ordered the 56 Up single disc version which is a different run and has different art on the disc. The replacement also had the same sound over the entire film. Someone told me they also heard the popping sound on their disc that they rented from Netflicks. I didn't see 56 Up in the theaters but I'm thinking the snapping might have been on the original soundtrack. If you notice the problem on your copy I figured out that the snapping sound is only on the left side so if you move all the sound to the right side speakers, the snapping sound entirely goes away. Overall, because of the minor problems with 56 Up, I give the complete series 4 3/4 stars and 3 stars for 56 Up by itself. I would say this should not stop anyone from watching/buying the complete set, I still highly recommend the series.The new and complete 7 Up to 56 Up series has the eight films on seven-discs (7 Up and 7+7 on the first disc) and they come in a nice, one-inch thick hard case. Six of the discs are a new run and match each other and only the 49 Up disc is different, which is from the 2006 single disc release. Special features include: a 29 minute interview with Roger Ebert and the director Michael Apted which was filmed in Roger's studio in 2006, audio commentary on 42 Up by Apted, photo galleries, filmmakers biography and a few random trailers (none of the trailers are on the Up series). It would have been nice if they had added an insert to this set but the cover art is very nice looking and on the back there is a very brief but detailed account of the series. Unfortunately, there are no subtitles for any of the films and English is the only audio option. 7-42 Up are filmed in full frame and 42-56 Up were filmed using digital cameras. 49 & 56 Up are widescreen format. 7 Up is the only all black and white episode.The 7 Up series is a fascinating study of human nature. My favorite episode is 21 Up because they really start to make good use of close ups and we begin to go deeper into their young adult lives. Suzy and Neil are the most fascinating to me and those two alone could have held my attention for the entire series. If you have never seen any of the episodes, you should consider watching them with some time in between each one. I would suggest watching one a week over 8 weeks and when doing so, think about how those who have been fans of these time capsules since the mid sixties have had to wait 7 years in between each new episode. The more time you have between each one, the more powerful they become.I would say that the 7 Up Series is one of the 10 all-time best dvd sets to ever be produced and is a must own for anyone who has a serious home video library. I can't see how anyone would go wrong in buying the set for $37.99 offered by Amazon, that's only $4.75 per episode.

The series is an engaging, absorbing, fascinating look at ourselves as human beings and how we erupt through our life's journey.

SymonHow generous of each of these people to allow us this glimpse into a mirror of every human adventure, how we travel through growth and change, and eventually arrive at self awareness, letting go of prejudice, despair, entitlement through dreams, ambitions, views of the future.Each film encapsulates the prior interviews (7, 14, 21, 35, 42) as well as the most current, revealing the process of environment and personality interacting over lifetimes. Partnering, aspiring young adulthood, raising children then adolescents which ushered in the most volatile period of the series, involving aging parents, dealing with loss, change, then maturing into their own skins, some as grandparents, with comfort and contentment.""Build up your life from nothing."" SymonAbsolutely stunning, the frank interviews pull me in and lead to surprising self-reflections. How grateful I am to live in a free country, where we have opportunities to grow and expand into ourselves.

844142,A1YRYWY01L9BZ6,B0002S64SC,SORE EYES,"[15, 17]","This series of films is based on the quote ""Give me a child until he is seven, and I will give you the man."" The theory is that personality is formed at 7. The film tests the theory.In the 1960's, film director Apted, interviewed 14 children in Britian. Every seven years he has gone back to interview the same children. Viewers witness what effect social factors such as wealth, single parenthood, private and public school education have on personality after the age of 7.I find the UP series endearing. Many of the participants say that they can't see anything of their current selves in 7 UP, however I can. It's amazing to see Michael, a nuclear physics professor at the University of Winsconsin, saunter across campus in the same exact way he walked down the road in the Dales in England as a wee boy. And precious Tony at 7 saying ""yeah, it's important to fight, fight, fight"" with a huge smile on his face before the camera cuts to him in a playground brawl. As an adult, we see that Tony never stops fighting for what he wants, but in the happiest of ways. When he doesn't realize his dream of being a jockey, his smile doesn't fade. He works hard to become a cabbie. In one of the  7 UP scenes we see Tony fall flat on his face, barely miss a beat before picking himself up and continue running, huge smile from the absolute joy of existence still plastered across his face.Children of broken homes will relate to Peter (?) who at 7 spent his time on the playground trying to build a little house of wood. Peter was in a children's home when 7 UP was filmed. It is clear to me that even at 7, with this sad little act of trying to build a playhouse for himself, he was trying to create security for himself. Like the other children from less stable backgrounds trying to create security for themselves, he marries young. Thankfully, he suceeds, but tragically he thinks he doesn't deserve his own success. At 49 we see him questioning why his wife loves him when he hasn't done all that well at making money. I saw early on that Peter would have been a great physical education teacher, but he is put off by a teacher who tells him he has to go to University. Neither his upbringing nor this sorry excuse for teacher make Peter believe he can go to uni and what sad long term affects it has on his self esteem.All but one of the children continues to be interviewed for the film in 49 UP. (One of the boys, ironically a TV producer himself, dropped out after 21 Up. Another one of the boys, a barrister, dropped out after 21, but is now back in the series. Susan says that she hopes not to be back after 49. ) A lot of the participants have animosity and hatred for the project and express it clearly in 49 UP. It's sad they can't see the benefit of the project. The only person who can give most of us insight into ourselves at 7 is our parents and let's face it, their memories fade with time, their perceptions aren't always insightful. But it must be difficult to have to face yourself with scrutiny. Susan says she admires how kids today have so much confidence without realizing that she probably has a lot more confidence because she looked at her painfully shy self on film at 14 and was probably at least partially influenced by that. Michael says people are fascinated with the project because it's reality TV but with people getting fat and balding. The 7 UP series doesn't feel like reality TV at all. There is no million dollar prize-just the chance to witness people coming to term with themselves and finding happiness which is infinitely more valuable than money. I for one will be extremely sad if these people choose not to come back in another 7 years. In the age of plastic surgery and publicists and kids who think they can life in million dollars lofts in NY with a tiny waitress salary because of what they've seen on TV-the 7 series is comforting. These are real people. Their stories are heartfelt. Their lives are worth witnessing-just as they are-normal.  These people bring tears to my eyes. I wish film was used for more of this kind of thing instead of filming plastic boob-a-loobs.I hope that the participants of the UP series begin to view the project positively.Film is the modern equivalent of having your portrait painted. It doesn't necessarily have to be the invasion it's made out to be. Your stories are valuable. You have taught me lessons just by being yourselves.Ask yourself who you were at 7? How were you influenced by what was going on around you? Did your parents provide you with an early life that set you on your course? Or did their emotional problems fling you far away from the path your innate personality would have put you on? Did you want to be an astronaut? Perhaps you never should have stopped studying science. Or perhaps you were shooting for the moon-a life of adventure. Maybe you just wanted a stunning career because you were being beaten to a pulp on the playground and desired respect. Maybe you wanted to be a coach driver because you wanted to see the world. Watch the 7 series and think about it.",5,WHO WERE YOU AT 7?,1172793600,"03 2, 2007",2007,5077,"['series', 'films', 'based', 'quote', 'Give', 'child', 'seven', 'will', 'give', 'man', 'theory',

They were concerned that our seeing so relatively little of them could create wrong impressions -- in some cases that things were left out that in their minds were just as important as what was left in, etc.  I think we have to respect their reservations -- in particular, John, the barrister QC, told us something of his young life that the series had never told, and it made me think that in the 7 UP and 14 UP episodes, we perhaps ought to have seen the parents and their interactions with their children and one another.  Without that perspective, the viewer can too easily get the impression that, in a general way, education and socio-economic status count for everything.  These are certainly important, but in the later episodes, it's assumed that the participants' relations with children and spouses are revealing.  Surely childhood relations with parents are at least as important (some of us would say, more so).In the 56 UP episode, John, who had refused to appear in two earlier episodes, seemed less prickly and defensive than he had seemed earlier.  I was glad to see him doing so well.  He's a generous man, and, I think, a pretty private man, and it might be that the earlier episodes did him less than justice.  His schoolmate Andrew is the same nice guy he has been for the whole series.  I was interested too to see Neil, who had been struggling to cope at 35, still hanging in with local government issues in Cumbria.  Good luck to him.  I wonder if other viewers get a feeling that one or the other character is a kind of ""hero"" of the series.  I tend to feel that way about Bruce -- a big, awkward math teacher, who was the one who at the youngest age seemed to have the most acute social conscience.  He taught in East End schools out of Oxford, then spent a year in Bangladesh, then reached out to Neil when Neil needed help.  He seems to have made a good late marriage, so good luck to him too.  The three girls from the working or lower-middle class -- Jackie, Lynn  and Sue -- have turned into attractive people, though Jackie, with her health problems, has perhaps had the hardest time.  Lynn, after years as a librarian who was especially good with children, has been sidelined by the budget cuts.  Sue has had the most success economically, now working as a university administrator.  These are strong capable people.  The pathetic Suzy of 14 up and the cynical Suzy of 21 Up has turned into a grounded, warm, person.  We know that her parents' early divorce hit her hard, and it's good to see her happy and settled.  Paul still seems to lack self confidence, but his family life is solid, in Australia, and the resilient Nick and Tony are as articulate and confident as ever -- in some ways, for all their differences, the least interesting (i. e. least likely to surprise) of the bunch, but doing pretty well.  It was good to see Peter back touting his band after all these years!  They sound pretty good.This series is well worth seeing -- just keep in mind that there is more to know about all these people and that what we see and what we get therefore isn't a total picture.

844145,A3CW4EZUTEV0VC,B0002S64SC,The Rocketman,"[152, 156]","Given one of the most sublime points of this series, that time is precious and fleeting, it's interesting to see that people ask why they should spend so much money on this series, rather than the more important question of why should they spend so much time.I resisted seeing 42 UP in the theater because I knew that one day these films would be on DVD and I wanted the pure experience of watching them all.  Well, here they are and I'm not disappointed.While Apted is very skillful in using previous clips to make each work stand on it's own, it's far more valuable to see each new clip as it unspools in real-time.  For one thing, Apted can't know the future when he makes each installment and so can't edit with an eye to the future (and he admits on the commentary track of 42 UP that the two times he tried, he got it completely wrong -- and in one of those cases lost a valuable participant).  For another, much of the richness of each interview is necessarily lost when it's chopped down to a sentence or two in later editions.  Some of the most telling and poignant moments are those when one of the subjects gives a look to the camera (or the loved one next to them) in silence.  Even Apted comments that about 80% of a particular film is edited out when he makes the next one.While it's true there is a bit of repetition if you watch all these movies back to back, the total sweep of the experience is awesome which more than makes up for it.  Apted does an amazing job by not commenting at all on the subjects (except through editing), letting the individuals speak for themselves.  Their statements are loaded in a way that only an outside observe can see.There are a lot of sad moments here as innocent childhood perceptions get washed away by the realities of life and it's telling that at least one participant seems to have dropped out permanently.  One of the lessons that you can see here is that regardless of place in society, not enough of us ever really consider, in a deep way, the values and dictates that our elders speak to us as children.  Perhaps that's why Suzy, Neil, Bruce, and Nick stand out for me - each has obviously done deep soul searching even in these snippets of their life.  (And what I wouldn't give for an interview with Charles who seems to have reconsidered his life once he didn't get into Oxford.)  For all their stature and privilege, John and Andrew seem the least imaginative of the entire lot and have lived lives on the conveyor belt as Charles puts it.  Wait for the mid-life crises to erupt in 49 UP.Be sure to listen to Apted's commentary on the 42 UP program.  He clearly explains why Symon was absent on 35 UP (the reason is one might guess after seeing him on 42 UP) and John and Paul are absent (probably forever).  It's most telling to me that it is the upper class (privileged) people who have the most problems with the Up Series (apparently Suzy does it reluctantly, but as part of her duty).Watching this set of DVDs is a totally valuable experience and excellent reminder that our time on this planet is finite, so enjoy them...and life!",5,worth your money...

My point is that there is a personal history in this series that goes from the participants and producers to the public.For all of its strengths and weaknesses, this is a very human documentation of English people as they grow up and mature. As I have written before, in agreement with Roger Ebert, this is one of the most important films (collective) of our time. It is a documentation of people in our times that takes us beyond the hyperbole and fabrication of media culture and gives us real people in their real settings. Also important is that it is an invited world and not one of voyerism. These peoples lives are uniquely important and the series shows how media and political presuppositions can't box people into class units, which is what was originally intended and I applaud Apted for continuing the series and allowing the series people to have their own voice.

However, it's a testament to the effectiveness of the film's basic concept that you find yourself itching to just pile through them once you've begun, particularly after 7 PLUS 7 as the participants face the struggles of adulthood.I occasionally I find the premise that the basic character-traits of a seven-year-old can telegraph the course of the rest of their lives a bit forced, indeed some participants are remarkably different as adults. Michael Apted's questions can at times feel leading or even irresponsible. Asking Neal, who clearly suffers from some bi-polar or schizophrenic disorder if he feels like a failure jumps to mind. Apted also reinforces traditional patriarchal notions of gender-roles by putting more emphasis on career satisfaction/achievement when questioning the men than he does the women, but this changes as the series commences.If this series is the granddaddy of all ""reality television,"" then it's easily the most credible. For the most part nothing is rushed or sensationalized, and we get a un-glamorized, straight-forward representation of the changes we go through in the course of living our lives. If this series were launched today we'd get flashy graphics, a music score, and staged dramatic encounters.
