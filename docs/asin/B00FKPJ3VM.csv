As someone who likes edgy material this was just a massive disappointment in the worst way. First off the acting stinks across the board,there was a chance to fully flesh out these characters but I dont know if it was the script or the inexperience of the director that got in the way, and the cardinal sin this movie commits is that its simply not erotic, NOTHING ABOUT IT IS. No progression to the narrative whats so ever, its quite simply prententious crap indie filmmaking 101. Please do a netflix binge watch than waste your time on this garbage.

In the guise of 'Eleanor', Abby, the bored lesbian housewife starts turning tricks with women to get some sex and attention. The sex was interesting (not salacious), and a few scenes with `Eleanor's' tricks were emotionally painful to watch because they they were so sad and intense. I also thought throughout this movie that Abby was coming to her senses regarding her unfulfilling relationship with her distant wife as she seemed to wake up from her emotional malaise. However, at the end of this movie, I was totally thrown by the nonsensical ending. I am giving this film 4 stars for Robin Weigert's terrific acting, but 1 star for the miserable and nihilistic ending, ergo my 2 star rating.By the way, I 'purchased' this movie and do not plan on watching it ever again.

1671880,A2S29EES9TA9ZM,B00FKPJ3VM,hredzak,"[12, 17]","... but it's not likely I'll watch it again.The story opens with two lesbian moms rushing to the hospital as one's been hit in the head and is a bloody mess.  Somehow this injury is connected to Abby deciding she can't take a soccer mom existence and Lesbian Bed Death a moment longer.  Her girlfriend Kate is frigid.  She's fed up with the two young kids and is getting pretty snappy with them.  She seems to enjoy fixing up houses, but she just isn't fulfilled.  The root of her emptiness (as far as she's willing to consider) appears to be that she seriously needs to get laid.  For some reason she turns to prostitutes to solve the problem.  In doing so, she is recruited into the game herself and becomes a hooker.  Okay, okay.... high class call girl at $800 a pop.Despite this premise don't expect 97 minutes of hot lesbian erotica... even if there are some graphic scenes.  This was a little cold and depressing.  Abby's desperation and inexplicable submission to her icy wife discouraged me from liking her.  I get that married people bind themselves with shared assets, pets, friends, and time etc etc... and often stay together for the wrong reasons.  I just have a hard time identifying with that kind of complacency.  I'd of liked more clarity on why Abby sticks around.  Moreover, I didn't find Abby attractive at all.  Physically or mentally.  So all I really saw was a cheating little weasel.  Worse, I never recovered from the first skank she beds- ACK.  That alone will make your libido shrivel if you're expecting hot fantasy.  Then enters her clientele... some very real and sad people.A better story woulda had that pretty blonde pimp getting naked at some point with her call girls... and Kate's iciness resolved when she discovers some hot BDSM is what gets her off.  Lost opportunity...Despite the lack of appeal for me... I found it an interesting look at Lesbian Bed Death and it's worth a watch if these themes don't make you freak. The acting wasn't even too bad.  And it didn't come off as a film school project.  Or a work of Nicole Conn.  It was pretty decently made for the genre as a matter of fact.  Nothing like the quality of, say, Imagine Me and You.  But watchable.  Better than the trailer suggested.  I just didn't find real character growth in the end and it just left me cold.  Abby never seemed to address the void other than inserting skanky sex with other bored or depressing women.  If that's the final sentiment on lesbians and long term relationships... sad, sad.  Since the DVD doesn't come with 3 cats and a vibrator (these leads sure ain't gonna keep ya warm!), I suggest renting.

It surprisingly exceeded my expectations. With the over exposure of everything under the sun thanks to Netflix, cable and Amazon Prime I have had a large variety of films in my scale of awful to excellent. The film centers on a woman in an unfulfilled marriage in the current stage of her life who ends up venturing outside the confines of her orderly world seeking passion that is currently lacking. I thought it was really interesting that her marriage was to another woman torching the old clich&eacute; of bored housewife neglected by her husband. It illustrated that relationships are relationships with all the same potential pitfalls regardless of gender. I also liked how the movie portrayed the variety of clients and interaction with Abby.

Movie about a upper class lesbian housewife that experiments with the &#34;oldest profession&#34; to satisfy her relationships' &#34;lesbian bed death.&#34;  But the film is so much more than that with subtext...  The films' star has some good acting chops and a great body to watch throughout the film, among the other hot women.  There is also another emotional journey that takes place for the main character, Abby, the lesbian housewife, that is interesting to witness.  Spoiler alert! Once specific moment in the film (you'll see in the trailer) when Abby takes on a neighborhood housewife (Sam) as a client was interesting, since a bit of hypocrisy arises when Abby calls out Sam for &#34;experimenting sexually&#34; outside of her current happy heterosexual relationship.  Abby has no room to criticize another for being unfaithful in light of her insatiable sexual appetite that motivates her &#34;call girl&#34; status.  The end of the film is another interesting take on relationships--turning a blind eye--that one you can judge for yourself if you care to.

I was hesitant because I wasn't sure if I was ready to watch this after watching Blue is the Warmest Color.  I had a free night to myself, so I gave it a shot, and wasn't disappointed.  Compared to Blue is the Warmest Color, Concussion would have to be the polar opposite.  Where Blue is all about passion, self-discovery and first love, Concussion is about lack of love, familiarity breeding contempt and self doubt.  Abby, the main character, is in a loveless relationship and has stopped working in order to be the stay at home mom.  In fact, she has denied herself a lot of things in order to appease her partner.  Deciding that she wants an extra-martial fling sets this movie into motion, and Abby sets out to find what she isn't getting at home.Someone wrote that Abby was awkward and stiff with her partners in the beginning, making those love scenes not so exciting.  While the character was stiff at first, you have to take a second and think why.  She is a 42 year old woman who has been with the same person for years, and this partner has denied her any type of pleasure for who knows how long.  Lots of thoughts would be swirling through one's mind, and I am sure that it would be difficult to bear yourself both mentally and physically to a stranger.  Abby eventually lets herself go and gets hooked on meeting the new &#34;referrals&#34;, not only discovering the different types of people and their sad stories, but also discovering herself at the same time.The parts of the movie that made me think was why does Abby decide to stay with her partner if she is so unhappy.  She even confronts her and says that &#34;I am yours, no one else can have me, but you don't want me.&#34;  Her partner admits that she doesn't want anybody, and Abby still stays.  Is it the money or the fact that they have 2 children; does she feel too old to start over? She is obviously good at what she does when she remodels places to flip them, so why doesn't she continue making her own money? The ending leaves it up to the viewer to decide, and it leaves you to keep thinking about what she will do.

However, what makes this film from writer-director Stacie Passon rather unique is that Weigert is married to another woman and all of her paid liaisons are with women of various ages.CONCUSSION, frankly, is rather slow going, but it&#8217;s Weigert&#8217;s multi-dimensional performance that makes this film worth watching.  She is a fascinating actress; certainly the equal of any other actress working in films today&#8230;and that includes the magnificent Meryl Streep.  Hopefully, she will get a vehicle one of these days that will allow her to breakout of episodic television and low budget features and prove that to the world.Maggie Siff, Johnathan Tchaikovsky and Janel Moloney co-star in the film, which has been released onto DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment.

The cover photo makes it look as if this will be a salacious affair, but the acting is surprisingly good and the material is not meant to titillate.  The main character, a partner in a lesbian marriage, is struck on the head by an errant toss at her son's baseball game.  The resultant concussion somehow clarifies her insight, and she comes to admit how barren of passion her relationship is.  Thus, she decides to seek employment as a lesbian escort, and thus embarks on a journey of self discovery.  Oh, there are some steamy moments, but there is a story here, with reasonably actualized characters who hurt, who experience both disappointment and revelation, and who ultimately achieve resolution.  The production values evoke an independent production, but the anonymity of the performers serves the story well, and aids in the forward movement.

When she's hit in the head by accident by her son wielding a baseball bat, this appears to be the catalyst that propels her into a new life of sensuous abandon.The concussion itself may be the catalyst but the real reason why Abby seeks to make changes in her life is because of the lack of passion in her relationship with her wife, Kate, an attorney who no longer seems to be interested in sex.Abby tries two separate forays with prostitutes--the first a disaster, as the woman makes her feel dirty when they have sex. The second is the opposite: Gretchen, a young, sexy woman who's putting herself through school by servicing clients. Abby meets the latter through Jake, a young contractor who she's conscripted to work on her new avocation--renovating fixer-uppers in Manhattan for profit. Things go so well with Gretchen that Abby decides to turn tricks herself for $800 a pop, with the help of Jake, who finds various clients for her.It does take a while before we break into Act Two when Abby sets off on her own, and often it's difficult to figure out who's who and what the characters are saying. This may due in part to director Stacie Passon's cinema verit&eacute; style.Once the protagonist begins meeting the clients, I would say what happens is mildly interesting. Abby has three main clients: an obese student who's never had sex before; a well-off middle-aged woman who at first leaves without engaging and a third woman, Sam (Maggie Siff), a bisexual woman who lives in Abby's neighborhood. The sex scenes are chaste in comparison to other 'art' films such as 'Blue is the Warmest Color' and here and there, Ms. Passon does a decent enough job of fleshing most of the characters out.The scenes involving the couples' children were obviously inserted to show that Abby's forays into self-gratification were not her sole preoccupation. In fact, she comes across as an involved Mom, along with her significant other, despite their inescapable estrangement.Passon's strategy perhaps is to illustrate her own fantasy life which is comprised of an active sex drive as well as a need to play therapist (Abby never sends away the inexperienced women who are in need of comforting).Some may be put off by Abby's detachment but personally that didn't bother me at all. Overall, this is a professional made film with actors that deliver an air of assured verisimilitude. The slow pacing may be off-putting and the denouement is indecisive, but for those with the taste for it, you should find the film engaging.
