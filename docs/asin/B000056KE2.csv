Recorded in SLP mode, the copy I viewed had iffy tracking and a degraded picture. Kinison himself was in top form, however.An intro from Sam's mom opens the program, along with a 1975 film clip of the former Pentecostal preacher in full swing.His XXX rated stand-up routine begins with a reference to Iran-Contra. The subjects Sam covers include adultery and revenge, also truth vs. lies. During some positively blasphemous Jesus jokes, Kinison displays his former Evangelical style. After a segue to ""Pat Robertson for President,"" Sam closes this section with the resurrected Jesus trying to explain to an accusing wife why he was gone all weekend.Next are mysogynistic jabs at ""heartbreakers"" and female weight gain after marriage. During his relationship advice for men, Sam pauses to introduce audience member Hugh Hefner. His raunchiest material (pleasing a woman orally) follows. After a warning that what came next was ""the bottom,"" Kinison launches into AIDS humor and some spirited gay bashing.The set closes with Sam playing the piano and doing an original ""song."" He dashes off, exits the stage door, hops into a black Corvette with the license plate EXREV, and zooms away into the night.SAM KINISON - BREAKING THE RULES is also available onDVD.",3,'Comedy's Wild Thing' in his classic 1987 TV special,1223251200,"10 6, 2008",2008,1361,"['SAM', 'KINISON', 'RULES', 'low', 'quality', 'transfer', 'one', 'Kinison', 'classic', 'stand-up', 'routines', 'Recorded', 'SLP', 'mode', 'copy', 'viewed', 'had', 'iffy', 'tracking', 'degraded', 'picture', 'Kinison', 'was', 'top', 'form', 'however.An', 'intro', 'Sam', 'mom', 'program', '1975', 'film', 'clip', 'former', 'Pentecostal', 'preacher', 'full', 'swing.His', 'XXX', 'rated', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'begins', 'reference', 'Iran-Contra', 'subjects', 'Sam', 'covers', 'include', 'adultery', 'revenge', 'also', 'truth', 'lies', 'positively', 'blasphemous', 'Jesus', 'jokes', 'Kinison', 'former', 'Evangelical', 'style', 'segue', 'Pat', 'Robertson', 'President', 'Sam', 'section', 'resurrected', 'Jesus', 'trying', 'explain', 'accusing', 'wife', 'why', 'was', 'gone', 'weekend.Next', 'are', 'mysogynistic', 'jabs', 'heartbreakers', 'female', 'weight', 'gain', 'marriage', 'relationship', 'advice', 'men', 'Sam', 'introduce', 'audience', 'member', 'Hugh', 'Hefner', 'raunchiest', 'material', 'pleasing', 'woman', 'orally', 'warning', 'what', 'came', 'next', 'was', 'bottom', 'Kinison', 'AIDS', 'humor', 'spirited', 'gay', 'bashing.The', 'set', 'closes', 'Sam', 'playing', 'piano', 'doing', 'original', 'song', 'stage', 'door', 'black', 'Corvette', 'license', 'plate', 'EXREV', 'zooms', 'away', 'night.SAM', 'KINISON', 'RULES', 'also', 'available', 'onDVD']",Sam Kinison - Breaking the Rules

I was at first shocked because of his straight ahead in your face relentless rambling.  But I never stopped laughing, I was rolling on the floor during the enitre show.  This is the first time I have seen that HBO show since it first aired back in the early 80's.  It is just as funny today as it was then.  The DVD has extra footage of a Las Vegas show Sam did several years later.  The later show was not as crisp as his HBO apperance, but classic Sam non the less.  He never really cared what other people or the establishment thought of him, he joked about everything nothing was off limits.  For this I commend him, he had a gift and he used it.

The infamous Ethiopian UHaul rant is probably the funniest bit I have ever seen.  His appearances on Rodney's other shows were generally pretty terrific as well as well as his turn in &quot;Back to School&quot;.He was so successful with Rodney's shows that that HBO gave him his own night, which is the main feature of this DVD.  It's classic Kinison and no topic is taboo.  It's pretty crass and if you are easily offended, it's not for you.  His highlights include a very funny rant about being dead (and I'll go no farther, but trust me, it's a blast).The main program, which was filmed in 1987, runs about 50 minutes is fun.  However, also included are bonus clips of Sam doing standup what appears to be several years later (I couldn't find anything that stated the year it was done).  Here you can see what the life of excess drugs and booze had done to Sam.  He looks worn out, strung out and burned out.  He's not funny.  In fact, his rants are more filled with hate than humor, in particular one related to Jerry Lewis and his &quot;Kids&quot; with muscular dystrophy.  And there aren't a whole lot of laughs from the crowd.

Peters ""MuscleHead""","[0, 1]","A furious presence onstage, Sam Kinison screams, cusses viciously, and makes plenty of gestures involving the use of his microphone and groin.  The title of this former minister's performance, ""Breaking the Rules"", is quite appropriate.  Many will laugh hysterically at this show, most will find it entertaining, and (big surprise)  some will find it distasteful.  Kinison is full of passion and energy, but his delivery needs refinement.  The jokes are funny, but the pace of the show is too slow.  Kinison wastes too many words, delays the punchlines for too long, and chuckles too often at his own material.  The show never stalls to the point of becoming uninteresting, but a faster tempo would have made for a much better show.  I assert this fully aware of the fact that Kinison's claim to fame was his ability to lull the audience a bit and catch them off guard with his famous screams.  Usually four letter words, always perfectly timed, Kinison could holler up a storm to keep things shocking and hilarious.  It is very unfortunate that his life was cut short.  Breaking the Rules showcases a diamond in the rough that could have really shined one day.  Any fan of standup comedy that has never seen Sam Kinison should check this out.It must be noted that this was filmed in 1987.  It sounds incredibly ignorant to consider AIDS a gay disease today.  But many of us were that ignorant in the 80s.  Still, he makes stronger statements concerning ""alternative lifestyles"" in the bonus material, which is sure to offend many people.  Perhaps all people, as the bonus clips are simply not funny to state it kindly. Also, the DVD includes a commentary track narrated by Sam's brother and sister-in-law.

Some of the subjects discussed in this show include (...) of the dead, Hell as Club Med, the real reason Jesus won't come back, and licking the alphabet on a woman. And that's the tame stuff. This is Sam at his prime, before he became the gigantic coke-fiend he was later known for (not that he wasn't funny THEN, too). Buy this DVD and learn why, even after he's been dead and rotting for years, people just can't shut up about him.",5,Funnier dead than many are alive,1004918400,"11 5, 2001",2001,706,"['world', 'was', 'robbed', 'comedic', 'genius', 'when', 'Sam', 'Kinison', 'was', 'killed', 'Thank', 'God', 'current', 'DVD', 'will', 'preserve', 'memory', 'comedy', 'forever', 'Sam', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'released', 'many', 'concerts', 'albums', 'time', 'ones', 'are', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'subjects', 'discussed', 'show', 'include', 'dead', 'Hell', 'Club', 'Med', 'real', 'reason', 'Jesus', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'licking', 'alphabet', 'woman', 'tame', 'stuff', 'Sam', 'prime', 'became', 'gigantic', 'coke-fiend', 'was', 'later', 'known', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'THEN', 'too', 'Buy', 'DVD', 'learn', 'why', 'even', 'been', 'dead', 'rotting', 'years', 'people', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shut', 'up']",Sam Kinison - Breaking the Rules

Sad to see him like that.  The only thing that disappointed me was the fact this is written up on the back of the DVD as a 'Never before released concert' but is actually the same exact show as the HBO tape in the yellow cover that was released in the 80's.  A must have in the collection to show your friends who have never heard of Kinison.  R.I.P.
