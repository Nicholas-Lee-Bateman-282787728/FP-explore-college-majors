This ancient and traditional tale goes to great extents to provide in depth coverage of how politics work as well as the relationship between the people and the government. Truly a wonderful tale that will keep you entertained. Full of magical creatures, beautiful art and fantastic animation. It is an entire journey of one particular girl and those she encounters along her way. Twelve Kingdoms one and two are an all time favorite. This series strays away from the common mecha, harem, comedy, and all around fun anime and dives deep into ancient folklore. There is plenty of action, mystery, magical creatures and fun loving characters. The series has a very serious tone to it and the creators establish well the world and all of it&#8217;s workings. The characters show excellent growth and development from the beginning to the end and you will have your favorites.",5,Classic and beautiful Chinese legend.,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,910,"['Classic', 'beautiful', 'Chinese', 'legend', 'ancient', 'traditional', 'tale', 'great', 'extents', 'provide', 'depth', 'coverage', 'how', 'politics', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'relationship', 'people', 'government', 'Truly', 'wonderful', 'tale', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained', 'Full', 'magical', 'creatures', 'beautiful', 'art', 'fantastic', 'animation', 'entire', 'journey', 'one', 'particular', 'girl', 'way', 'Twelve', 'Kingdoms', 'one', 'two', 'are', 'time', 'favorite', 'series', 'away', 'common', 'mecha', 'harem', 'comedy', 'fun', 'anime', 'deep', 'ancient', 'folklore', 'plenty', 'action', 'mystery', 'magical', 'creatures', 'fun', 'loving', 'characters', 'series', 'very', 'serious', 'tone', 'creators', 'establish', 'well', 'world', '8217', 's', 'workings', 'characters', 'show', 'excellent', 'growth', 'development', 'beginning', 'end', 'will', 'have', 'favorites']",The Twelve Kingdoms Collection One Volumes 1-5

The kingdom, the people, the story were great and I would buy it in a flash IF they were to ever FINISH the story. But, regretfully, that seems most unlikely. The series was canceled with a lot of unanswered questions and I don't want to be frustrated or disappointed again. So, today,The Twelve Kingdoms Complete Collectionis gone from my Wish List.
