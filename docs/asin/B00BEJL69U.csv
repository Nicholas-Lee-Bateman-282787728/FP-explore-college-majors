1633438,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00BEJL69U,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I don&#8217;t think there has been a film to come out in recent memory that had me so entertained and yet so disappointed as &#8216;This is the End&#8217;.  It&#8217;s not that my expectations were astronomical, and like I said, I was entertained immensely, but there was something about the film itself that left me feeling like it kept pulling itself back from being great.  It&#8217;s so preposterous and so outlandish and yet I couldn&#8217;t help but feel that most of the film was skirting around actually being as preposterous and as outlandish as it wanted to be.Don&#8217;t get me wrong; this film is ridiculously off-color and offensive and yet&#8230;not?Maybe it&#8217;s just that we&#8217;ve become so desensitized by the barrage of Judd Apatow films that throw everything in our face and dare us to get offended, but I found very few things about this film particularly inventive in the idea of outrageous comedy, and I even think other films have gone further and been more creative in their use of offence to entertain (like, &#8216;Tropic Thunder&#8217; steamrolls this film in making the offensive so utterly digestible while maintaining a level of shock).  Still, while nothing feels inventive or new, the cast is hilariously on point and they sell everything.Also, is it just me or was this one of the best films since &#8216;Being John Malkovich&#8217; to exploit the stereotype of celebrity while giving actors a perfect canvas to make fun of their own reputations?So, &#8216;This is the End&#8217; basically takes &#8216;Project X&#8217;, mixes in something like &#8216;Cloverfield&#8217; and sprinkles in &#8216;The Exorcist&#8217;, all the while trying to one-up those &#8216;Scary Movie&#8217; films by having all these actors do all this ridiculous stuff as themselves.  The film&#8217;s plot, or what there is of one, has Jay Baruchel coming to L.A. to spend time with Seth Rogen.  The two have drifted apart because Rogen is a Hollywood sell out and Baruchel is rather self-righteous and jealous of Rogen&#8217;s new field of friends, which include James Franco and Jonah Hill.  The night that Jay arrives in L.A., Seth takes him to Franco&#8217;s house warming party and soon the world starts to end, the apocalypse is in full swing and comedians start dying all over the place.  Cera is impaled, Watson becomes a warrior queen and Robinson survives far longer than one would expect (you know, since the black guy always dies first); and then there is Channing Tatum, but you need to see that for yourself.In parts, so much of this works because it is pretty hysterical.  The &#8216;getting high and filming the sequel to &#8216;The Pineapple Express&#8217;&#8217; scene was glorious, the cannibal scene was epic and that Backstreet Boy reunion in heaven is probably the single greatest moment in film for the entirety of 2013, and yet with all that goodness I couldn&#8217;t help but feel like it just didn&#8217;t all come together like I thought it would have.  There were too many moments where I&#8217;d come off of a HUGE laugh by being almost entirely bored with a while scene.  The film just wasn&#8217;t tonally consistent, and I expected that from these guys.  The entire cast is so ON this.

1633470,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B00BEJL69U,Brian C.,"[0, 1]","I really love the premise of this movie and my love for the premise might be effecting my over all opinion of the film. Whenever I really love the premise of a movie I am almost always a little disappointed in the actual execution. I never quite feel like any movie is able to live up to my expectations or I start thinking of all the things I wish they had done or I wish they had not done or done differently. I love the idea of a self-lampooning comedy about actors who play themselves and are trapped in a house at the end of the world. I also am a big fan of Michael Cera -  who, admittedly, is only in the first twenty minutes or so of the movie, but is responsible for what I think were the film's funniest moments - and Jonah Hill - who does a great job lampooning his reputation as a ""nice guy"" in this movie.I also love the way the film focused on the changing relationships between the main characters who are left after the apocalypse (James Franco, Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, and Danny McBride). The layers of Hollywood phoniness begin to peel off as they are trapped in the house and their true feelings begin to come to light and it gives rise to a number of really hilarious moments between the characters. The changing relationships also allowed the filmmakers to make a movie that takes place almost entirely inside a house while still maintaining the audience's interest (more on this a little later).There are really, I think, two kinds of humor in the movie: there is what I will call character comedy, for lack of a better term, and there is gross out comedy. Character comedy includes the ridiculousness or exaggeration of certain characters. Jonah Hill's false veneer of friendliness is hilarious and Danny McBride's crudity and unconcern for everyone else brings a lot of laughs (although I started to get a bit frustrated by it at some point). Character comedy also includes moments where characters do things that seem out of character (think about Quagmire's love for cats in Family Guy). For example, the idea of all of these actors being scared and cuddling up to sleep together. The best character comedy in the movie, in my opinion, is the portrayal of Michael Cera as a coke addled womanizer. The movie is worth watching for that alone but there is a lot of great character comedy in the movie.There is also a lot of crude humor in the movie. I feel like there was kind of a shift in humor after South Park became really popular. South Park somehow managed to elevate low brow humor into high brow humor and there was a huge influx of crude humor as a result. I certainly have nothing against crude humor (I love South Park) but I feel like there has been such an influx of it (The Hangover, The 40 Year Old Virgin, etc.) that it has lost some of its shock value. When Cartman defecates on Mr. Garrison's desk it is shocking and unexpected and the humor is at least partly based on the shock. However, I feel like we are accustomed now to guys talking about masturbation in extremely explicit terms, urine jokes, etc, and it is no longer as shocking or funny. So, this is my long-winded way of saying: I loved the character humor in the movie, I think it really worked, but I was not as impressed with the attempts at crude humor, I don't think they worked as well.I also felt, at times, like the movie was reaching for a story line. They had a great premise: actors trapped in a house at the end of the world, but then they were faced with the problem: what are the characters going to do trapped inside a house for an hour and forty-five minutes? The scenes where they are making a sequel to Pineapple Express, and the scene where they take ecstasy and dance around, felt like they were just filler, attempts to give everyone something to do, that were loosely stitched together. It would have been easy to make a story out of the end of the world if the characters had been trying to get somewhere but the premise of the movie is: they are trapped in the house. That made it difficult to construct a story. However, I will say this: I was never bored.Finally, I felt like the end was a bit predictable. I am not sure that could have been avoided but the fact that I had guessed how it was going to end before it actually ended detracted from the experience a bit for me. SPOILER ALERT. I knew that when Craig decided to sacrifice himself he was going to get sucked up to heaven and I knew that when Seth decided to let go he would be taken up to heaven as well. I was surprised and pleased with Franco's unexpected fall from grace and I really enjoyed Danny McBride as a cannibal and the final vision of Satan striding over Hollywood as it burned. All of that made up somewhat for the predictability.Overall, I think the movie was definitely worth watching, it is one of the better comedies I have seen in awhile, but it still suffered from what I consider to be some minor problems that kept it from being what I would consider a perfect comedy (if such a thing exists).",4,A great premise and adequate execution...,1381276800,"10 9,

It has a hilarious cast, crude and clever gags that could be enjoyed by cinephiles and stoner couch potatoes alike, and it's bolstered by a strong premise that allows for organic situation comedy. It's a film about a group of actors trapped in a house during the apocalypse. For that kind of set-up, there is not another group of Hollywood misfits that could have possibly made a movie better than This Is the End. The sheer energy of the script and chemistry between the hysterical actors is amazing. It's also very fun to watch a group of people the audience feels like they already know. The actors riff off their public personas in a totally amusing way and make one wonder how much of a difference there is between the actor and the character. The dynamic between Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel is a solid dramatic anchor while the conflicts between Craig, Jonah, James, Danny, and Emma Watson offer lots of genuine laughs. In sheer filmmaking terms, This Is the End is actually pretty impressive for Seth and Evan Goldberg's debut. The camerawork is pretty tight while the special effects, for a stoner comedy, are fantastic.

1633527,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEJL69U,FNDNreview,"[3, 8]","Over the course of film history, we've seen some masterful comedy teams grace the big screen.  Legendary actors, like The Three Stooges, Cheech & Chong, and Chris Farley & David Spade have set the bar for comedy, paving the way for the current generation.  The odds of modern comedy acts ever making us laugh as much as the classics is slim to none, but that doesn't necessarily mean the genre has gone stale.  Enter: Seth Rogan.  After his supporting role in The 40 Year Old Virgin, Seth Rogan burst on the scene, quickly collecting key roles in Knocked Up and Superbad - thrusting him ever farther into the Hollywood spotlight.  Rogan currently dangles in the world of acting, producing, writing, and now directing - sharing the role with Evan Goldberg on the new comedy, This Is The End.Based on the short film Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse, This Is The End stars Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and Jay Baruchel as themselves in a fictional world.  Jay Baruchel arrives in Los Angeles and Seth Rogan takes him to James Franco's housewarming party, but the party is interrupted when chaos ensues, along with blue lights ""rapturing"" individuals to heaven - leaving Rogan and his cohorts behind to live in a world filled with hellfire and brimstone.  Holed-up in Franco's house, Danny McBride enters the fray, causing bedlam in the house.  Baruchel, Rogan, Franco, Hill, and McBride must figure out a way to survive in a world filled with demons, and a lack of rations.  Emma Watson, Jason Segel, Rihanna, and Mindy Kaling also star in supporting roles as fictional versions of themselves.In the beginning, it's difficult to warm up to this film, mostly because it's just a bunch of celebrities sitting in a room getting high and bickering about pointless things.  Once the earthquakes begin and the chaos commences, this is a relatively flawless comedy.  Seth Rogan, Johah Hill, and the rest of the main cast are secluded in James Franco's swanky new house and are relentless with ""the funny.""  Danny McBride shows up and wipes out the group's rations of food and water, thus creating the major predicament for the entirety of the story.  The fact that the story portrays these individuals as themselves is quite genius idea and entertaining, as they continuously make jokes about one another, also reference the work they've done with one another on previous films, including the popular comedy, Pineapple Express.For the fans of Pineapple Express, This Is The End will be a treat. With the success of Pineapple Express, fans have been clamoring for a sequel, and even though there has been talk and rumors about a sequel being made, it has yet to come to fruition. This Is The End gives a slight taste of what it could have been or could be in the future and plays off the real-life friendships between Rogan & Franco, building off their chemistry from Pineapple Express.  Franco and Rogan speak highly of the idea for making a sequel, making several references to the possibility.  Due to the circumstances of the Armageddon, the duo decide to create the Pineapple sequel at Franco's house (filmed using a camcorder with die-cast vehicles as props) - giving away one of their ideas for the sequel.  In any event, it's great to see the wheels are still turning for the future of Pineapple Express 2.Obviously, since the majority of the film takes place in one house, the time has to be filled with enough entertaining shenanigans to progress the story to the point of a viable conclusion.  Prior to the arrival of Danny McBride, the characters severely lack major conflict.  Aside from their petty personal quips with one another, these characters often spend their time being rational and getting along with one another.  McBride brings the character conflict, not to mention the endless array of humorous situations.  Aside from McBride's contributions, the major comedy comes from the video confessionals (in all its Jersey Shore-like glory), followed by one extremely entertaining, yet slightly bothersome demon possession of Jonah Hill.  As himself, Jonah Hill is rather bland and un-amusing, at least until he's visited in his sleep by this rather ambitious devil-like creature.Overall, This Is The End is unlike the majority of comedy films currently out there, combining some of the funniest actors in Hollywood as themselves.  The film is full of puns, profanity, and everything else that has made Seth Rogan and company the sensation they are today.  When it comes to a recommendation, This Is The End is on the fence - mainly because of the content involved.  Teenagers will eat this film up for its party antics and sexual references, but at the same time, it's a completely male-driven film.  Emma Watson and Rihanna appear, but are here and gone before you know it - thus creating a large void in the female presence category.  In any event, This Is The End is still a superb film, filled with quirky humor, a passionate cast, and a long list of Hollywood cameos that will have you laughing out loud for minutes on end.  If you're a lover of crude humor and not easily offended, This Is The End has the potential to be your next favorite comedy.  In fact, This Is The End is so funny, it might leave you with to urge to go wait in line and see it again.  It is - without a shadow of a doubt - the must see comedy of 2013.Final Grade:  A-FNDNreview.com",5,'This Is The End' the must see comedy of 2013,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,5382,"['course', 'film',

All of that, and more, are portrayed by a bunch of actors (using their own names, which was different and the only original thing here) during the events of the rapture event and apocalypse.It's too-long of a flick. It's full of rotten music & 'partying', where getting high + drunk while looking ridiculous is the most important thing in the characters' lives (which is what a lot of real people sadly believe, too). This is the movie for any of you who were hoping to see guys drink their own urine, talk about rape, and have an extended argument concerning male ejaculation. If that's not enough, there are also male demons with emphasized genetalia and a scene of cannibalism. It covers the whole gamut of sickening stuff. There was basically nothing funny attempted that didn't include something disgusting. In many other R comedies (like the 'classic' ""There's Something About Mary""), I've found more creativity and at least some attempts at humourous segments that wouldn't have been R-rated on their own. A best part in this flick -- which wasn't funny -- was when one of the actors spoke of how it seemed wrong that he made more money than those with important careers. I guess, however, he and everyone in this piece of dreck still made a bunch of money.I give it the rare 1-star rating.

I watched this movie because many of these actors have produced works ranging from genuinely funny to moderately tolerable. But after this piece of dung covered trash I am wondering where several of these celebrities will end up. It stands as a theological and existential expression of what many in the secular world believe... or don't believe and that is what is really scary. I have to wonder how many of these actors actually hold beliefs along similar lines to that which their characters espoused. A theory not lacking in a basis for truth since they all starred as 'fictional' expressions of themselves... a dangerous line to walk. But they are all resilient right? They can handle it.I started watching it because the trailers focus largely on the first half of the movie... something strange starts to happen and some people are swept up in the rapture and others start dying horrible deaths involving but not limited to being sucked into an abyss or flattened by cars or various machines falling from buildings... and one lamp post impalement.From there the movie degenerates into the actual apocalypse interpretation complete with demons, devils and the like, all black and evil and sporting large male appendages. Through further degeneration the movie infers a male being raped culminating in possession... an awful biblical reference to the book of Revelations that could not be more wrong and down into the final pit involving cannibalism and more anal rape (what was Channing Tatum thinking? Did he lose a bet?)None of the performances stand out. All of the actors debase themselves in some way or another. The humor is crude and base. The references and images and inferences get worse with each minute. you know it is bad when there is an actual giant phallic symbol as part of the furniture in Franco's house.I am poorer and dumber for seeing this movie. I am usually able to find some element of value in a movie so that my reviews are not fully negative but in truth I could not wash the stench of this movie off me afterwards. I would ask for my money and time back but I would rather forget that my eyes and ears beheld this at all.For the truth about God and going to heaven... see Ephesians 2:8-9 and Romans 10:9.

In fact, I usually enjoy comedies that push the line and have a bit of ridiculousness.  For example, I liked Superbad, Wedding Crashers, etc.  So, a bit of crass comedy doesn't bother me.  What troubles me here is the plot is a bunch of actors just goofing off and doing stupid stuff without a real storyline.How many times is it funny (if ever) to watch guys smoking weed and doing drugs without there being a bigger plot?  How about a few B-rated bloody attack scenes with bloody heads rolling around just for the hell of it? Maybe this is edgy and cool to high school kid.  But, it's not particularly clever (i.e. Half Baked) and lacks real comedic talent.  All of these actors have done better in other roles.  So, it would have been much more funny if they had a background and a decent plot to accompany the drug use and vulgarity (i.e. Harold and Kumar).

1633617,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00BEJL69U,J. Richardson,"[2, 6]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.It's a party at Franco's house and everybody's invited! No, I'm being serious. If you pick a comedian at random there's a pretty good chance they're in here. Unfortunately, halfway through the party there's this huge earthquake, a giant sinkhole, and a good chunk of the cast dies. If anything, this is my biggest complaint with This Is The End. I would have loved to have seen some interaction beyond the six main ""characters"". For example, I was so happy when I saw Jason Segel, but I don't remember him having more than one line of dialogue and Paul Rudd came and went in a matter of 90 seconds. The disappointment stops there, however, because from that point on This Is The End is a non-stop laugh fest that has you fighting to control your bladder.While This Is The End is going to attract a lot of attention from its extensive cast of actors (which include the likes of Michael Cera, Emma Watson, Aziz Ansari, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse), its main focus is on the six men who seem to have all been in a movie together at some point in time. You follow Seth Rogen, James Franco, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, and Danny McBride who all play some exaggerated version of themselves. The world is ending and the apocalypse is here. This is kind of the glue that holds the film together because the main story is about Rogen and Baruchel's ""struggling"" relationship.Most of the movie is spent in Franco's new house, which he deems ""the fort"". Because you have six grown men stuck in a house together with limited resources, tempers start to flare. Things get said and the truth comes out. This is where the meat of the comedy is found. The banter between these six comedians as they continue to bash one another is nothing short of magical. Danny McBride is probably the most ruthless of the six as he appears to ""hate"" every single person in the house. Jonah's over-the-top kindness never stopped being funny and I couldn't help but laugh every time I saw Craig's ""Take Yo Panties Off!"" shirt.With the comedy comes some unexpected suspense, however, and that's when the theater became dead quiet. Because we've entered the apocalypse demons are roaming around the city and each one is packing a gigantic penis. There's no avoiding its gaze as Goldberg and Rogen make it a point to zoom in on its monstrous size. There's only one really intense scene with Robinson and Baruchel, but, for me, it really killed the flow of the film. We were given joke after joke after joke and then boom! I've never seen a theater become so quiet so quick. While it made sense given the context of the film, I still feel like This Is The End wouldn't have suffered without it.Another thing that kind of threw me off was the hefty amount of religious talk scattered throughout the movie. From the start Baruchel sees this as our ""judgement day"" because he saw people being sucked up into the sky by blue beams of light. I assumed it would stop there and they would take a different approach to the whole ""end of the world"" theme, but I was wrong. Baruchel continues to back his statements and we slowly start to learn that he was correct in his assumption. For those of you who aren't religious or aren't Christian, don't fret. While they are using the bible as a way to smooth out the rough edges of the story, it's merely there to provide a message: Be nice to people and try to put the needs of others above your own. You don't need to believe in God to understand that basic concept, but it's still something that seems long forgotten in today's world.Finally, the visual effects in this movie are fantastic for a comedy film. While each demon has your run-of-the-mill design, they're all given an extreme amount of detail. If you're a comedy enthusiast you're going to be impressed by what you see here. Usually comedy films don't have huge budgets, so when one wants to include CGI of some sort it usually looks terrible. This Is The End completely destroys that trend and made it clear that comedy films deserve to be just as creative as your big-budget Sci-Fi action films.Overall Score: 9/10 - I was really surprised at just how much I enjoyed this movie. I had some high expectations given its cast and I wasn't disappointed. From start to finish the comedy was non-stop and I even had tears streaming down my face during some sequences. What makes it so great is the fact that it's so ruthless and confident in its delivery, which makes it so easy to fall in love with. If you're a fan of Rogen and his posse of friends then you should definitely see this. This Is The End is truly one of the best comedies I've seen in years and I can't wait to see it again.",5,9/10 - Fantastic,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,4715,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.It', 'party', 'Franco', 'house', 'everybody', 'invited', 'No', ""'m"", 'being', 'serious', 'pick', 'comedian', 'random', 'pretty', 'good', 'chance', ""'re"", 'here', 'Unfortunately', 'halfway', 'party', 'huge', 'earthquake', 'giant', 'sinkhole', 'good', 'chunk', 'cast', 'anything', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'End', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'interaction', 'six', 'main', 'characters', 'example', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'when', 'saw', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'having', 'more', 'one', 'line', 'dialogue', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'came', 'went', 'matter', '90', 'seconds', 'disappointment', 'there', 'however', 'point', 'End', 'non-stop', 'laugh', 'fest', 'fighting', 'control', 'bladder.While', 'End', 'going', 'attract', 'lot', 'attention', 'extensive', 'cast', 'actors', 'include', 'likes', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Aziz', 'Ansari', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'main', 'focus', 'six', 'men', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'together', 'point', 'time', 'follow', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'James', 'Franco', 'Craig', 'Robinson', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'who', 'play', 'exaggerated', 'version', 'world', 'ending', 'apocalypse', 'here', 'kind', 'glue', 'film', 'together', 'main', 'story', 'Rogen', 'Baruchel', 'struggling', 'relationship.Most', 'movie', 'spent', 'Franco', 'new', 'house', 'fort', 'have', 'six', 'grown', 'men', 'stuck', 'house', 'together', 'limited', 'resources', 'tempers', 'start', 'flare', 'Things', 'get', 'said', 'truth', 'out', 'where', 'meat', 'comedy', 'found', 'banter', 'six', 'comedians', 'continue', 'bash', 'one', 'nothing', 'short', 'magical', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'probably', 'most', 'ruthless', 'six', 'hate', 'single', 'person', 'house', 'Jonah', 'over-the-top', 'kindness', 'never', 'stopped', 'being', 'funny', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'time', 'saw', 'Craig', 'Take', 'Yo', 'Panties', 'Off', 'comedy', 'unexpected', 'suspense', 'however', 'when', 'theater', 'became', 'dead', 'quiet', ""'ve"", 'entered', 'apocalypse', 'demons', 'are', 'roaming', 'city', 'one', 'packing', 'gigantic', 'penis', 'avoiding', 'gaze', 'Goldberg', 'Rogen', 'make', 'point', 'zoom', 'monstrous', 'size', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'intense', 'scene', 'Robinson', 'Baruchel', 'really', 'killed', 'flow', 'film', 'were', 'given', 'joke', 'joke', 'joke', 'then', 'boom', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'theater', 'become', 'so', 'quiet', 'quick', 'made', 'sense', 'given', 'context', 'film', 'still', 'feel', 'End', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'suffered', 'it.Another', 'thing', 'kind', 'threw', 'off', 'was', 'hefty', 'amount', 'religious', 'talk', 'scattered', 'movie', 'start', 'Baruchel', 'judgement', 'day', 'saw', 'people', 'being', 'sucked', 'up', 'sky', 'blue', 'beams', 'light', 'assumed', 'would', 'stop', 'would', 'take', 'different', 'approach', 'whole', 'end', 'world', 'theme', 'was', 'wrong', 'Baruchel', 'back', 'statements', 'slowly', 'start', 'learn', 'was', 'correct', 'assumption', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'religious', 'are', ""n't"", 'Christian', 'do', ""n't"", 'fret', 'are', 'using', 'bible', 'way', 'smooth', 'out', 'rough', 'edges', 'story', 'merely', 'there', 'provide', 'message', 'Be', 'nice', 'people', 'try', 'put', 'needs', 'others', 'own', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'believe', 'God', 'understand', 'basic', 'concept', 'still', 'something', 'long', 'forgotten', 'today', 'world.Finally', 'visual', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'fantastic', 'comedy', 'film', 'demon', 'run-of-the-mill', 'design', ""'re"", 'given', 'extreme', 'amount', 'detail', ""'re"", 'comedy', 'enthusiast', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'impressed', 'what', 'see', 'here', 'Usually', 'comedy', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'huge', 'budgets', 'so', 'when', 'one', 'include', 'CGI', 'sort', 'usually', 'terrible', 'End', 'completely', 'trend', 'made', 'clear', 'comedy', 'films', 'deserve', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'creative', 'big-budget', 'Sci-Fi', 'action', 'films.Overall', 'Score', '9/10', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'given', 'cast', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'start', 'finish', 'comedy', 'was', 'non-stop', 'even', 'had', 'tears', 'streaming', 'down', 'face', 'sequences', 'What', 'so', 'great', 'fact', 'so', 'ruthless', 'confident', 'delivery', 'so', 'easy', 'fall', 'love', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Rogen', 'posse', 'friends', 'then', 'should', 'definitely', 'see', 'End', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'again']",This is the End

A cross between slap stick, drugged out, dark humor science fiction film.. I really don't know.  The humor for the most part is crude, going from uncomfortable man moments to drug binged stupidity to violent head chopping and soccer kicking scenes.  None of it is particularly funny to me.  I guess for those who are fans of Rogan's style of comedy might enjoy this but for me, I couldn't get through the movie without turning off.

I really enjoyed the movie, but it does tread on some ground that is bound to make a number of people uncomfortable or downright angry with it. So, save yourself the $25 and rent it from your local redbox or movie rental place. If you like it enough to buy it after seeing it once then go for it. At the very least, watch the trailer and you'll get a good idea what to expect. If you don't like the trailer then you'll probably feel the same way about the movie as a whole.With that said, I would also recommend NOT reading the reviews of the movie before you watch it (doh! I guess you have already done what you shouldn't by reading this review!). There are a number of reviews on this site that have some pretty substantial spoilers. The reviewers most likely had good intentions (you know, I hate this movie so I will tell you exactly why.. even if it is a bit of a spoiler. Or, I loved this movie and this scene was awesome because..), but they take away from the experience by going into the nuances of the movie and explaining why it was so horrible.I have read many reviews on here stating that ""all of the good parts were in the trailer... etc."" I'd like to mention that many of the scenes from the trailer were outtakes. Yep. They're not actually in the movie. Some are similar, and some are scenes from the film, but many of them are outtakes. So, don't worry about that.Rather than reading through the dozens of spoilers on Amazon, just take a look at the ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and you'll see that a majority of the people that went to see it enjoyed it. However, the Amazonians should be a good indication that there are people that dislike the film, and will be very vocal about it.Rotten Tomatoes scores as of 9/23/2013Critic reviews: 84%Audience reviews: 80%Actual review:This film is right along the lines of pineapple express. If you liked that film than this one will probably bring some smiles to your face. I enjoyed the acting, script, and the way that the overall movie played out. However, just like pineapple express this movie will be split by people that love it and people that hate it. Personally, I did not see any deviation from what you would expect from the group of actors involved in this film. If you know their personalities then you'll get to see some fairly overly exaggerated versions of them that often lead to some really funny stuff.I have read some reviews on Amazon from people that claimed that they loved all of the actors in every one of their previous movie, but hated them in this one because they were ""Sophomoric."" This is ridiculous. The writing for this was well done and the humor is exactly what you expect. It was maybe a little bit more in your face and grungy than normal, but not really out of the realm of things that they have already performed in the past.Acting 9/10It's pretty much what I had expected. It's entertaining and they're all willing to go pretty overboard while representing themselves.Story 9/10I think the story is pretty great. I enjoyed the film enough that I've watched it 3 times, now. While it's not a deep and insightful story, there were parts that you appreciate more your second time around.Filming 9/10This is a bit.. unreal at times. However, it was pretty obviously meant to be that way and is pretty great a majority of the time.Characters 10/10I got a kick out of their interactions with one another.As I said at the beginning of the review, I would recommend renting it to get some sort of idea about what you might be purchasing.Update: 10/09/2013I'm a little bit surprised to see a few people marking this as unhelpful. If you have an issue with it then please leave a comment and I will be happy to respond and take your critique into consideration. However, if you are trying to find a review to justify purchasing this movie then that's a weird concept to me and I'm really not sure why you're looking on Amazon for it.

If you understand and are interested in the basic premise, I'm not sure how you can be let down.BASIC PREMISE: A group of actors are left behind during the Rapture and must fight to survive in a world of anarchy, demons, and general evil. Keep in mind that this is meant as a comedy. Keep in mind that these actors are playing themselves, or at least exaggerated versions of themselves. Keep in mind that these are thirty-something guys who have made a lot of money on movies featuring drugs, sex, and general gross-out goofiness.Most of the negative reviews on this site either complain about the religious aspect (which is like a physicist complaining that THE MATRIX is a bad movie because it's not feasible to use humans to power computers) or they just say that they thought the movie featured stupid, low-brow, juvenile humor (which is like complaining about a Three Stooges short being too violent). It's really confusing how you could consider the concept and go into the theater expecting anything other than a goofy, irreverent, sprawling survival comedy.In fact, a ton of the humor lies in the fact that these guys obviously were having a ton of fun making the film. They mock each others' bad movies, poke fun at their hedonistic lifestyles, and embrace their basically fragile vanity. ""We're just actors! We pretend we're bad a**es, but we're not!"" The old school soundtrack is also a lot of fun and is almost certainly composed of the actors' favorite songs (including a heavenly granted wish to reunite the Backstreet Boys). And there's a ton of death, destruction, and demon rape, which is something you might probably expect during Armageddon.If you've read all of this and have even an inkling of a doubt -- say, you flinched at the phrase ""demon rape"" -- then don't sit down, watch the film, and become incensed when you don't like it. Expect a rollicking free-for-fall with actors lampooning themselves in an apocalyptic setting, and you should have a blast, because that's all the film wants to be, and it succeeds 100%.",5,Exactly What It Wants To Be,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,2468,"['will', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'are', 'religious', 'specifically', 'Christian', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'something', 'joke', 'about.', 'expect', 'typical', 'movie', 'structure', 'central', 'conflict', 'three-act', 'arc', 'identifiable', 'protagonist/antagonist.', 'take', 'life', 'even', 'just', 'movies', 'general', 'too', 'seriously.It', 'baffles', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'knowing', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'unsatisfied', 'understand', 'are', 'interested', 'basic', 'premise', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'let', 'down.BASIC', 'PREMISE', 'group', 'actors', 'are', 'left', 'Rapture', 'must', 'fight', 'survive', 'world', 'anarchy', 'demons', 'general', 'evil', 'Keep', 'mind', 'meant', 'comedy', 'Keep', 'mind', 'actors', 'are', 'playing', 'least', 'exaggerated', 'versions', 'Keep', 'mind', 'are', 'thirty-something', 'guys', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'lot', 'money', 'movies', 'featuring', 'drugs', 'sex', 'general', 'gross-out', 'goofiness.Most', 'negative', 'reviews', 'site', 'complain', 'religious', 'aspect', 'physicist', 'complaining', 'THE', 'MATRIX', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'feasible', 'use', 'humans', 'power', 'computers', 'just', 'say', 'thought', 'movie', 'featured', 'stupid', 'low-brow', 'juvenile', 'humor', 'complaining', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'short', 'being', 'too', 'violent', 'really', 'confusing', 'how', 'could', 'consider', 'concept', 'go', 'theater', 'expecting', 'anything', 'other', 'goofy', 'irreverent', 'sprawling', 'survival', 'comedy.In', 'fact', 'ton', 'humor', 'fact', 'guys', 'obviously', 'were', 'having', 'ton', 'fun', 'making', 'film', 'mock', 'others', 'bad', 'movies', 'poke', 'fun', 'hedonistic', 'lifestyles', 'embrace', 'basically', 'fragile', 'vanity', ""'re"", 'just', 'actors', 'pretend', ""'re"", 'bad', 'a**es', ""'re"", 'not', 'old', 'school', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'lot', 'fun', 'almost', 'certainly', 'composed', 'actors', 'favorite', 'songs', 'including', 'heavenly', 'granted', 'wish', 'reunite', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', 'ton', 'death', 'destruction', 'demon', 'rape', 'something', 'might', 'probably', 'expect', 'Armageddon.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'have', 'even', 'inkling', 'doubt', 'say', 'flinched', 'phrase', 'demon', 'rape', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'film', 'become', 'incensed', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Expect', 'rollicking', 'free-for-fall', 'actors', 'lampooning', 'apocalyptic', 'setting', 'should', 'have', 'blast', 'film', 'be', '100', '%']",This is the End

1633656,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00BEJL69U,Mark Turner,"[0, 2]","When writing reviews of comedies it becomes quite difficult. On one hand if it's really good you want to let people know that the movie is hilarious. At the same time if you start telling the jokes or setting up the stories prior to punch lines then the jokes aren't funny for those going to see the movie (I was once told BLAZING SADDLES was hilarious but knowing the jokes didn't find it near as funny). So let's see what I can do in letting you know about THIS IS THE END just released on DVD.It's hilarious. Okay so I know I have to go further than this. The movie involves real movie stars playing themselves, sort of. Seth Rogen stars as Seth Rogen picking up his friend Jay Baruchel at the airport for a visit in LA. They head back to Seth's house where he has everything prepared for a wonderful visit. But before the night gets too far gone he suggests they head over to James Franco's house to visit. Jay isn't quite interested because in his mind this is Seth's new friends which have helped the two part ways lately.Of course they show and are greeted by Franco who shows them around the house he helped design. All of the gang is there too including Jonah Hill portraying himself as the nicest of guys you could ever want to meet. Craig Robertson is there as his usual laid back self. While not there at first Danny McBride makes his presence known as well. All of these actors have been together in movies one way or another over the last few years. But they're not alone.Small parts are played by others from this same group who've been in some major hits over the past 6 years. Michael Cera (who I've never been a big fan of but who does a tremendous job of tearing apart his squeaky clean image here), Christopher Mintz-Plasse, David Krumholtz, Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Mindy Kaling, Emma Watson, Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari and Rihanna all make an appearance at this party. And yes each one takes a turn at making fun of themselves and Hollywood culture.As the night moves on Seth does what Jay predicted he would which is leave him behind to spend more time with these new LA friends. Of course Jay also sets him up for failure not realizing that Seth has talked to his LA friends about accepting Jay as one of them. Eventually the duo head out to pick up a pack of cigarettes for Jay and on the way talk about the whole situation while walking. And then it happens.In a quick mart the ground trembles, windows shatter and suddenly people are being beamed into the sky by bright blue lights. Yes it's the Armageddon and those deemed worth are being taken to Heaven. The rest are left behind. In the midst of destruction and chaos the pair return to Franco's party to discover no one there has noticed anything happening at all. A few tremors later and heading to the front lawn they discover LA a flaming mess and the ground in front of the house opening and swallowing various celebs.So you're probably saying well gee...this doesn't sound funny at all. Trust me when I say that as the end begins so do the major laughs. I know it's hard to believe but it's true. What follows is the celebrity gang's attempt to survive and find a way to get out. The comedy plays off of their attempts at survival, their better than the rest attitudes concerning life and their confrontations with the demons and such released on this world.The laughs come naturally in all of this world end mess rather then being forced. Comedy bits involving character, dialogue, physical comedy and situational comedy are all found here and to give up even a taste would be to ruin the movie for viewers. I saw this film at the theater and laughed more openly than I had at a comedy in years. Being able to watch it on DVD gave me the chance to hear/see the things I missed and to be able to pause if I laughed too hard.One thing you need to realize up front though is that the humor here is some of the crudest found in some time. Jokes involving bodily fluids, sex acts and language are strewn throughout. If you've seen movies involving these actors then you already expected that. For me it didn't offend and seemed more in line with what I would actually expect from most of these actors in real life.I can't begin to recommend this movie enough. As I said it had me near rolling on the floor at times and that was when I saw it in the theater. At home I can roll around with no one giving me the eye except for our dogs and cats. I would venture to say that this is one comedy I'd have no problem watching over and over again.

Rogan drags Barchuel to a party that's hosted by James Franco and attended by Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, and many others (to Barchuel's dismay, as he was hoping to spend a quiet evening in with Rogen.)  As the duo goes out to pick up additional party supplies, a mysterious blue light starts taking people away while those who haven't been absorbed become at risk for comedically horrific deaths.  Though no one at the party initially believes them, they start to once the carnage begins taking place at Franco's door step.  With no where to go and no one to turn to, it's up to the group to find a way to survive amongst the limited rations they have and the constant personality clashes they endure with each other.  Will they survive, or will they become victims of the apocalypse?  Will any of them be ""saved"", or will they too perish horrifically?  Guess appearances are made by Emma Watson, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Aziz Ansari, Rihanna, Mindy Kaling, Kevin Hart, The Backstreet Boys, and many, many more.Though there's nothing genuinely groundbreaking with this film like there was withThe 40-Year-Old Virgin (Unrated)orSuperbad, it's still pretty funny and not only is there a prolific amount of celebrities in the film, but they're good sports about having jokes made at their expense.  Though the humor's crude, it's still there, and while those who are a bit more prudent with their humor may be offended, others will have laugh out loud moments at the follies the crew goes through.

Both wrote the screenplay as well but I suspect much of the film was outlined and the comedic actors improvised along the way.  This is a twisted, profane and gross take on the Apocalypse as you will ever see.The cast all play versions of themselves and everything begins at a party at James Franco's brand new house.  Every Gen-X comedic actor is there and the sniping and back-stabbing begins early on.  When what is believed to be an earthquake rocks the house, the majority of the celebs (Michael Cera, Mindy Kaling, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Martin Starr, Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari and oh yeah Rhianna) meet their demise falling into a giant pit of fire.The survivors (Franco, Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson and Jonah Hill) retreat back into Franco's still standing house.  After seeing people streamed to heaven encased in a blue beam of light as well as devilish monsters breathing fire, the guys conclude it is indeed the Biblical Rapture.Rogen and Goldberg take turns making fun of the various characters including movie bombs.

The basic premise of ""This Is the End"" is very simple: take a bunch of Hollywood stars playing a (supposed) fictionlized version of themselves, let the world come to an end, and let's see what happens!Several comments: going into the movie, I didn't know a whole lot about it, and in particular whether this was supposed to be funny, serious, scary, and/or more than that. I think co-writers/co-directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg were debating the same issue while developing the movie, as in the first 45 min. of the movie, the movie truly is all over the place. But eventually it becomes clear that this is tilting heavily towards comedy and indeed the last hour of the movie are pretty much rip-roaring. When the situation around you has become so desparate, Rogen and Goldberg have concluded that there is only one way to deal with it: laugh at the absurdity of it all. That leads to some truly hilarious scenes, such as when the group of 6 (Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, James Franco and Craig Robinson) are holed up in Franco's house and out of boredom they decide to make up a sequel to Pineapple Express starring themselves and with various props. After they watch the final product (called ""Pineapple Express 2: Blood Red""), Rogen comments dryly ""that was great, we should make more sequels of our movies"", ha! There is some fun music in the movie (have your dancing shoes ready for the final sequence!), most of wich is also featured on the CD soundtrack. Strangely, that CD does not include ""The Beginning of The End"", that new song from a reunited Black Sabbath (with Ozzy Osbourne), even though that songs plays prominently over the closing credits of the movie.So how does this movie compare to those other ""end of the world"" movies? I'd still have to give the edge to ""Seeking a Friend"", perhaps Steve Carell's finest role ever, but ""This Is the End"" easily better that that artsy/pretentious ""Melancholia"". One caveat: ""This Is the End"" contains a boatload of cursing and other crude language, so viewer beware.

About the worst movie I've seen this year. The plot was horrible, the jokes were horrible, it's interesting that they can't act themselves well, either, and most of it seemed like they were really just making a home movie for themselves and hoping everyone would pay to see it. Well, I guess that part ended up to be true.The concept of the entire cast playing themselves through an entire movie is interesting and could have proven quite good if done well. But this wasn't. In one scene Seth and James are talking about a sequel to Pineapple Express (which I loved). This doesn't look or feel like a real conversation at all.

It's good stuff from start to about the finish, but there does have to be a little appreciation for the actors in this film.  The film features exaggerated versions of the actors playing themselves, often in self deprecating ways, in the midst of an apocalypse/rapture.  A lot of the humor is derived on the actors' portrayal of themselves, often poking fun at their common depictions in their films.  For example, there's a joke about Seth Rogen always playing himself while Jonah Hill is creepily nice and Michael Cera in a cameo is a downright jerk.  This type of humor drives a lot of the film's jokes and keeps the pace going.But like all films with this crew, it has heart and has a story that carries it beyond the humor.  The bonding and growth of the friendship of Seth and Jay is central to the story.  Yes, characters do learn lessons.  Without giving away a major plot point, there is an allusion to the idea that most actors don't deserve to be saved from the apocalypse.  The story works.  And you can't help but feel this is some sort of catharsis for the actors involved in this movie (and reportedly, it is).The movie loses some steam towards the very end.  It feels a little rushed.  But admittedly, there's only so many ways you can go with an idea like this.  The movie rests mostly on its continual humorous banter between these very talented comedians.  In some ways, this reminded me of another self referential comedy - Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back by Kevin Smith.  That film was very forced and I could only love it so much.  This is the End is the way to do it.  It feels very loose, fun, and honest - Never forced.  It's rooted very much in the improvisational gifts of these comedians.

An ""end of the world"" movie starring actors like Seth Rogan, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, James Franco & Craig Robinson PLAYING THEMSELVES!  These actors and a number of their Hollywood friends (Danny McBride, Michael Cera, Paul Rudd, Aziz Ansari and most randomly Rihanna and Emma Watson) all assemble at a party at James Franco's house just when all hell literally breaks loose.  True, it sounds a bit self-important and self-indulgent...but who cares when the results are as obscene and hilarious at it all turns out.This end of the world scenario involves the biblical apocalypse, and it all starts with the rapture, as people all around are suddenly drawn up to the skies by heavenly tractor beams.  This is witnessed by Jay Baruchel and Seth Rogan...and they run back to the raucous house party only to discover that NO ONE has been raptured from amongst these Hollywood partiers.  That alone is pretty hilarious.As the scenario plays out, horrible things happen to many of the stars until only a few are left to ride out the end, trapped in Franco's house with a woefully under-stocked pantry.  The ""plot"" of the film isn't terribly important, to be honest...the fun is in watching these guys play versions of themselves that are HIGHLY unflattering, and yet not necessarily so far off the mark to be totally unbelievable (although I sure hope Michael Cera is NOTHING like his character in the film...absolutely disturbing and hilarious).  Seth Rogan has some fun riffing on the idea that he plays the same character in all his films.  Baruchel HATES all these guys.  Jonah Hill comes off as effete and creepy.  (And Emma Watson gets to drop some f-bombs and endure some funny Hermione jokes.)  And James Franco is looser than he's been in awhile...reminding us of why he became such a big start in recent years.It's a sloppy film that feels like it was LOADS of fun to make.  The laughs are frequent (and frequently around some pretty R-rated material...this film is not for delicate constitutions).  The budget is high enough to allow for some pretty amusing sight gags.  The jokes and insults fly fast...this is certainly a movie that will reward a repeat viewing, as there is no way to catch everything the first time.  And yet, as is often the case with Seth Rogan related comedies, the film has a heart as well.  I'm not going to say it's ""moving""...but it has moments of redemption which is important, because I think the film might come off as too mean-spirited without them.  We need the ""soft"" moments to take off the edge.  This tendency is what has made movies like KNOCKED UP or SUPERBAD into classics...the fact that underneath the edgy, foul-mouthed, ""screw it all"" attitude is some old-fashioned feeling.THIS IS THE END doesn't always work.  The jokes and bits come so frequently that some of them must misfire.  Danny McBride and James Franco have a lengthy scene together in which they discuss...well, let's just say it involves McBride's self-abuse proclivities...and it goes on for too long.  It's funny at first, but then just crosses the line.  This is a film that really tries hard to come up to the line over and over...sometimes it crosses over with crassness and sometimes just by letting the jokes go on a few beats too long.  But it HITS far more than it misses.THIS IS THE END is VERY funny and very offensive (in the best possible way).  It is deeply politically incorrect (yea!).  It is certainly not for everyone.

Like, for real.Well, Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg think they know what it would be like and, in &#8220;This is the End,&#8221; they&#8217;ve gathered some of the industry&#8217;s hottest young stars - James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, and Rogan himself, all playing themselves - to illustrate it for us.The question is: how do these guys - who get paid mega-bucks to essentially play at make-believe all day - do when confronted with a real-life crisis, one designed to test their mettle and their basic humanity, in which courage, heroism, self-sacrifice, quick thinking and dexterity with firearms may be the keys to survival? Turns out, just about as well as the rest of us mere mortals would. And that&#8217;s the kernel upon which Rogan and Goldberg build their affectionate satire, as the boys hunker down in James Franco&#8217;s pad in the Hollywood Hills to try and ride out biblical doomsday in all its high-tech/CGI/matte-painted glory.The filmmakers capture the pampered movie star lifestyle with canny accuracy: the orgiastic partying, the drinking and casual drug use, the conspicuous consumption, rampant self-indulgence and egotism run amok.  Is it any wonder, then, that none of these Hollywood types are deemed worthy of being sucked up in the rapture, but are instead left behind to fend for themselves and to think long and hard about why they couldn&#8217;t go with all those other good people? And are they truly past redemption or is there some way to still make amends for a life poorly lived so that they too can take that light beam shuttle to the sky?In addition to the leads, fellow celebrities Michael Cera, Emma Watson, Mindy Kaling, Paul Rudd, Rihanna, Channiing Tatum and The Backstreet Boys make cameo appearances either before or after the cataclysmic event.Deftly blurring that fine line between fact and fiction, this super-meta movie features fun, self-deprecating performances and a sly and knowing script laced with amusing parodies of sci-fi/horror and action movie cliches.Clever and amusing.",4,Unique take on the apocalypse,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,2203,"['Hollywood', 'made', 'millions', 'dramatizing', 'pending', 'apocalypse', 'what', 'apocalypse', 'were', 'happen', 'Hollywood', 'real.Well', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Evan', 'Goldberg', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'be', '8220', 'End', '8221', '8217', 've', 'gathered', 'industry', '8217', 'hottest', 'young', 'stars', 'James', 'Franco', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'Craig', 'Robinson', 'Rogan', 'playing', 'illustrate', 'us.The', 'question', 'how', 'do', 'guys', 'who', 'get', 'paid', 'mega-bucks', 'essentially', 'play', 'make-believe', 'day', 'do', 'when', 'confronted', 'real-life', 'crisis', 'one', 'designed', 'test', 'mettle', 'basic', 'humanity', 'courage', 'heroism', 'self-sacrifice', 'quick', 'thinking', 'dexterity', 'firearms', 'may', 'be', 'keys', 'survival', 'out', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'mere', 'mortals', 'would', '8217', 's', 'kernel', 'Rogan', 'Goldberg', 'build', 'affectionate', 'satire', 'boys', 'hunker', 'down', 'James', 'Franco', '8217', 's', 'pad', 'Hollywood', 'Hills', 'try', 'ride', 'out', 'biblical', 'doomsday', 'high-tech/CGI/matte-painted', 'glory.The', 'filmmakers', 'capture', 'pampered', 'movie', 'star', 'lifestyle', 'canny', 'accuracy', 'orgiastic', 'partying', 'drinking', 'casual', 'drug', 'use', 'conspicuous', 'consumption', 'rampant', 'self-indulgence', 'egotism', 'run', 'amok', 'wonder', 'then', 'none', 'Hollywood', 'types', 'are', 'deemed', 'worthy', 'being', 'sucked', 'up', 'rapture', 'are', 'instead', 'left', 'fend', 'think', 'long', 'hard', 'why', 'couldn', '8217', 'go', 'other', 'good', 'people', 'are', 'truly', 'past', 'redemption', 'there', 'way', 'still', 'make', 'amends', 'life', 'poorly', 'lived', 'so', 'too', 'can', 'take', 'light', 'beam', 'shuttle', 'sky', 'addition', 'leads', 'fellow', 'celebrities', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Mindy', 'Kaling', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Rihanna', 'Channiing', 'Tatum', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', 'make', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'cataclysmic', 'event.Deftly', 'blurring', 'fine', 'line', 'fact', 'fiction', 'super-meta', 'movie', 'features', 'fun', 'self-deprecating', 'performances', 'sly', 'knowing', 'script', 'laced', 'amusing', 'parodies', 'sci-fi/horror', 'action', 'movie', 'cliches.Clever', 'amusing']",This is the End

This seems exactly the case with This is the End, and I would agree that it is far from a failure of a film, but that ingenious initial concept is also a double-edged sword as anticipating audience members may be slightly disappointed by the potential wasted. Part of the problem may also be the film's strength, with a lack of focus in filmmaking which no doubt comes from the amount of material where the stars allow vanity to take over. However self-deprecating the humor may be, they also over-estimate the audience's interest in watching nothing but these actors talk about themselves for a large portion of the film.The film begs one simple question: what would happen to all of the celebrities if the biblical end of days began while James Franco was having a party? The actors all play themselves in this satirical apocalypse comedy, and it seems that nobody working in Hollywood will be taken to heaven if the rapture were to occur. All of the regular members of the Judd Apatow clan are present (although he has no attachment to this project), many of which have fun playing themselves before meeting a final demise. The cast of Superbad has a coke-fueled reunion by the pool with a particularly hilarious Michael Cera, Jason Segal unenthusiastically discusses his role on ""How I Met Your Mother,"" and Martin Starr hangs out in the background. Most are only around long enough to make an appearance and die, although Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson all manage to hole up with Franco in his impressive new home.This is the point at which the film starts to fall apart, but also has some of the film's most humorous sequences. These six characters/actors have various grievances with each other, nearly always addressing the issue with some sort of two-faced behavior. This bickering takes up a majority of the time waiting out the apocalypse, though they also have a large quantity of drugs and a video camera to film a trailer for the sequel to a highly successful Franco/Rogen collaboration also written by Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who make their directorial debut with This is the End. This pair has written a number of humorous films now, but This is the End has the odd problem of trying to do too much and not doing quite enough.The Blu-ray release includes a DVD and digital copy, as well as a large amount of bonus footage and extras in the special features. There are many alternate takes of improvised lines, but it mostly just displays the ability of the editor to pick out the best ones. Franco and McBride's verbal sparring over the porno magazine is the highlight of these alternate takes. There are also deleted scenes and a gag reel, not to mention the short film with Baruchel and Rogen which inspired this movie. There are featurettes which include comments from the actors on playing themselves, the marketing for the film, and even a making-of for the Pineapple Express 2 trailer within the film. Rogen and Goldberg also have a feature commentary track. All but a few of these 90 minutes of extras are exclusive to the Blu-ray disc.For more reviews visit [...]",4,Real Movie News Blu-ray review,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,3216,"['films', 'are', 'based', 'ideas', 'so', 'brilliant', 'impossible', 'fail', 'exactly', 'case', 'End', 'would', 'agree', 'far', 'failure', 'film', 'ingenious', 'initial', 'concept', 'also', 'double-edged', 'sword', 'anticipating', 'audience', 'members', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'potential', 'wasted', 'Part', 'problem', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'film', 'strength', 'lack', 'focus', 'filmmaking', 'doubt', 'amount', 'material', 'where', 'stars', 'allow', 'vanity', 'take', 'over', 'However', 'self-deprecating', 'humor', 'may', 'be', 'also', 'over-estimate', 'audience', 'interest', 'watching', 'nothing', 'actors', 'talk', 'large', 'portion', 'film.The', 'film', 'one', 'simple', 'question', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'celebrities', 'biblical', 'end', 'days', 'began', 'James', 'Franco', 'was', 'having', 'party', 'actors', 'play', 'satirical', 'apocalypse', 'comedy', 'nobody', 'working', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'heaven', 'rapture', 'were', 'occur', 'regular', 'members', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'clan', 'are', 'present', 'attachment', 'project', 'many', 'have', 'fun', 'playing', 'meeting', 'final', 'demise', 'cast', 'Superbad', 'coke-fueled', 'reunion', 'pool', 'particularly', 'hilarious', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Jason', 'Segal', 'unenthusiastically', 'role', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'out', 'background', 'Most', 'are', 'only', 'around', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'appearance', 'die', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'Craig', 'Robinson', 'manage', 'hole', 'up', 'Franco', 'impressive', 'new', 'home.This', 'point', 'film', 'fall', 'apart', 'also', 'film', 'most', 'humorous', 'sequences', 'six', 'characters/actors', 'have', 'various', 'grievances', 'other', 'nearly', 'always', 'addressing', 'issue', 'sort', 'two-faced', 'behavior', 'bickering', 'up', 'majority', 'time', 'waiting', 'out', 'apocalypse', 'also', 'have', 'large', 'quantity', 'drugs', 'video', 'camera', 'film', 'trailer', 'sequel', 'highly', 'successful', 'Franco/Rogen', 'collaboration', 'also', 'written', 'Rogen', 'Evan', 'Goldberg', 'who', 'make', 'directorial', 'debut', 'End', 'pair', 'written', 'number', 'humorous', 'films', 'now', 'End', 'odd', 'problem', 'trying', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'doing', 'quite', 'enough.The', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'DVD', 'digital', 'copy', 'as', 'well', 'large', 'amount', 'bonus', 'footage', 'extras', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'many', 'alternate', 'improvised', 'lines', 'mostly', 'just', 'displays', 'ability', 'editor', 'pick', 'out', 'best', 'ones', 'Franco', 'McBride', 'verbal', 'sparring', 'porno', 'magazine', 'highlight', 'alternate', 'are', 'also', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'not', 'mention', 'short', 'film', 'Baruchel', 'Rogen', 'inspired', 'movie', 'are', 'featurettes', 'include', 'comments', 'actors', 'playing', 'marketing', 'film', 'even', 'making-of', 'Pineapple', 'Express', '2', 'trailer', 'film', 'Rogen', 'Goldberg', 'also', 'have', 'feature', 'commentary', 'track', 'few', '90', 'minutes', 'extras', 'are', 'exclusive', 'Blu-ray', 'disc.For', 'more', 'reviews', 'visit', '[', ']']",This is the End

Directed and Produced by comedy super-team Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, THIS IS THE END brings many of the gut-busting hijinks viewers have grown accustomed to from their previous films SUPERBAD and PINEAPPLE EXPRESS.This film is hilarious, largely due to each actor playing fictionalized versions of themselves. As expected, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill retain their comedic pace from their other movies, but the unexpected comedy from Michael Cera, Emma Watson, James Franco, and even the Backstreet Boys is what carries this film from ""haha"" funny to hard-to-breath funny.

Well I for one loved this movie I could understand why some people had a hard time digesting it. Some comedy is ""too much"" for some people but I say to hell with it, its all in good spirit. Going into this and seeing names like Franco, Rogen, Hill, etc you should automatically know your not getting Oz:The great and powerful 2. Instead your getting a rated R comedy that works hard to make sure it deserves that rating!The plot is beyond simple of our main cast attending a party at James Francos house, while on the day of the rapture. As soon as blue beams take people up to heaven and the ground opens up, thats when the laughs begin! From that point on its a tale of survival from these egotistical, exaggerated, caricatures that our cast portray.

They have a huge number of cameo actors who are in the movie for a couple minutes acting very much out of character or over the top.

Based on a short film called Jay & Seth vs. the Apocalypse, this movie ups the ante in every sense of the word. The comedy you have come to expect from Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, James Franco, Jonah Hill, and Danny McBride is top notch. The rest of the cast, all playing themselves, is also played perfectly. Injected with horror in fact, some right out of famous horror films like Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist, this movie also brings the scares and gore, although it never loses sight that it is a comedy, first and foremost.When Jay comes to LA to party with Seth, they end up hitting a party at James Franco's new, druglord-type mansion. All the celebrities are there: the main cast of 6 mentioned above, Michael Cera, Rihanna, and others that I won't spoil the cameos for. Then, it comes to a crashing halt when the party is stopped by the oncoming End of Days. Death and destruction leave the 6 leads trapped in James' house, with very little but themselves to entertain each other and survive. Comedy ensues in every form, from spoofing themselves in nearly every movie they've been in, to the explicit vulgarity we have come to love in their films like Superbad, Pineapple Express, Knocked Up, and so on, but kicked up a few notches. Everyone gets a chance to shine too, which is great, because they all give 110%, and the movie is all the better for it. The horror is in top form too. It is surprising how easy it just comes to the screen in such a raunchy comedy with these recognizable faces, but that is part of what makes the movie so enjoyable.You will laugh at nearly everything that this film throws at you, even if you feel you shouldn't be laughing at, such as exorcism and drinking urine. I expected this movie to be funny, but not near as funny as it turned out to be. Not only did Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen write this, they also directed it. Keep them in mind, because they will be getting much more to do when this movies hits hard.

During This is the End, the Book of Revelation, the apocalypse according to the Bible, is played out by Rogen and a bunch a actors playing themselves with a ton of funny cameos. Okay, the movie doesn't exactly follow Scripture, but the implication of the righteous being saved while the sinners go to Hell is loud, clear and hilariously well done.James Franco is having a Hollywood house party. His house is full of actors that you'd expect to see in a Seth Rogen film, along with some surprises. In what initially looks like another stoner movie about...well getting stoned...things get really crazy when the ground opens up and literally all Hell breaks loose. The 6 guys on the cover of the promo on this product page are left in Franco's house, and must figure out if there is a way out of the apocalypse, and what ensues is hilariousness, silliness, scariness, decent special effectness, and of course...stonerness.The movie earns its R rating I think mainly due to the sexual innuendo and graphic descriptions of certain acts. There's some gore, but it's mostly stuff that you might also see in a PG-13 movie these days. I was more amused throughout the movie than I thought that I'd be, and I was surprised by how well some of the scares were mixed in with the comedy, and how well some of the CGI was done.Overall, if you likedPineapple Expressor most of Rogen's other movies you should love This is the End.

The reviews, as you can see, are pretty much split down the middle.  Very evenly divided between people that either loved the hell out of this movie, or completely hated it.  From my experience, an even split like that should tell you that the movie is definitely worth watching, but your reaction to it will be a strong-guided opinion with no type of wavering whatsoever.  So there you go.The movie itself is ridiculous.  The story is even more ridiculous.  However, the situations are acted out so well that it left me in tears in various scenes throughout.  Without giving some scenes away, you have to understand that there is a type of comedy out there where the more ridiculous it is, the funnier it will be.  This is that type of movie.  If you can think back to movies like Wedding Crashers and Old School, the humor in those movies comes from the ridiculous predicaments the characters are placed in, and it takes a certain actor to deliver that freaked out scream that will you get you laughing out loud with no end in sight.  With that being said, if you can appreciate ridiculous and unbelievable situations being portrayed as a comedy, then you will thoroughly enjoy this film.

1633766,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B00BEJL69U,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 1]","SPOILERS:didn't suck cause it had some elements of truth. main problems were film needed a stronger villain, one who had an articulated agenda and who appeared before the final act. In the Romero films at least there were newsmen to provide information about the sudden chaos, and in the Alien films, at least there was an android to explain why the monster was allowed on board; this story gave us nothing but what the impacted characters could figure out for themselves, but the writers didn't use the first act to establish the main characters as trustworthy. (Ex: paraphrase, out of town friend: ""so you've given up gluten, I guess that means you've stopped smoking pot and drinking too."" Seth character: ""no I'm not psychotic."" So does the audience trust a slacker character's perspective at the end of the world? And if so, why?). Definitely needed the villains point of view.  The film also needed a tighter structure, which would've been partially fixed by having the villain appear earlier in the story.film paid homage (i.e., stole from) many other films, normal for hollywood. what I found interesting was the subtext of what it might be like for some to be youngish, semi-rich and semi-famous in hollywood; the off-putting balance between trying to straddle the world of your non-hollywood family and friends who are easily wowed by your possessions (but who you need to treat you the same as they did pre-fame because that helps anchor you), while you yourself see and understand the dirty underbelly of the fake hollywood shine, that you must network (e.g., hangout) and be perceived to share similar (e.g., supposedly hip, edgy, and/or advanced) values of the in-crowd to get ahead in the business, an apparently incoherent world where getting cleanses, smoking pot, drinking, and doing coke, are not necessarily mutually exclusive.the hollywood in this film was the one where you needed to network with the right crowd to get work (aka hollywood as the 50s era golf course).  I think the film gave some insight into that world, showing how difficult, fake and challenging it can be in that super competitive marketplace where you are not the funniest person on the block, but one of a 100 funniest people and must find a way to differentiate yourself from the pack. to differentiate yourself you need access to people and apparently the people with power love to party so you must be willing to at least attend parties. (see the scene where one guy was laughing hysterically at some stupid joke being told by a known actor, whose name I forget (I'm middle age and ill so don't remember the names of 30 something people, though I remember his face. He dated a 30 something actress whose name I forget as well.  It's harder when you get older and are sick, the generation of actors younger than you just blur, though I try to read People online to at least keep up alittle; plus it's free to look at the magazine online)I'm a prepper (a person who puts aside provisions in case of financial or other difficulties), so I found the story interesting from a prepper point of view, i.e., characters turning on one another when there is insufficient food/water, and the choices desperate people may make (i.e., willingness to consume body fluids when water is unavailable).so there was truth here with regards to celebrity and ambition, and there was truth with regards to how some people are likely to react given a complete societal breakdown, but then there was the cartoony hell, devil and heaven section and I guess my biggest complaint about that is the villain wasn't written well enough. A giant devil-godzilla monster with a correspondingly giant penis is not enough of a villain. while it is true you never see penises of giant monsters, that one new element in and of itself does not a strong villain make.what I liked about the story was how the writers showed how pedestrian the flashy hollywood is in that it depends on networking just like other businesses; and I also found it believable that stress during a societal breakdown brought out the worse in some characters. the two sequences I found most believable, and sad in a way, were (1) when the paparattzi (did I spell that right?) simultaneously harassed, insulted and asked the Seth character for a favor at the airport (""do a Seth Rogan laugh for me"") which the character obligingly does, and (2) the slimy hanger on yucking it up at the hollywood party: those situations gave what I think are an authentic, and unappealing, glimpse into what it means to be famous in this country, and were among the strengths of the story for me. I thought the acting was good. And I appreciated that the actors/actresses/filmmaking team tried to entertain me. 2 and 1/2 stars.",2,if you like apocalypse films you might like it...,1381881600,"10 16,

But, from what I've been told, these actors seem to make movies together and that is how they ""roll""The script isn't a new one but they seem to pull it off and makes the audience wonder what exactly is going on. I personally thought it was aliens what were abducting people but when he started talking about the bible, I put it all together. He doesn't seem to get much right but I guess that was the intended purpose. We go through a lot of dialogue with a bunch of it way ""over the top"" (too vulgar to say on here but anyone that's seen the movie would get it) One scene that was funny was when the girl with the Axe was going to get some sleep and the guys were joking around about which one of them (the guys) they will rape first...she overhears and gets out of the house.Okay, from start to finish......The party and the scenes were very funny. the ""obnoxious"" guy with the two girls was....not. Taking a look at the scenes with the fires all over and the pit that swallows up most of the party goers (who none of them get ""raptured"" isn't really surprising...lol) was funny to watch, yet, sad to see.When their other friend shows up and eats their food (you know, the ignorant one), I could see the situation for these guys to be going downhill fast. They fight, fight, fight until he leaves, only to reappear as the demonic carnivore. The premise of how the guys get ""raptured"" for doing ""good"" deeds is very cheesy and over the top. They witness demonic flying creatures, chimera (I think) and one demon who sneaks into one of their room with a 5 foot long...well.....umm.....never mind. (another example of over the top humor)Well (without giving the movie away) some of them get raptured (one gets raptured but was arrogant..thus wasn't....and gets eaten) some just die from various things. But, overall, at the end when you see 1,000 foot tall Satan and his ""package"" (something I did not want to see) and they get away, I knew that the movie was most likely over.Overall, this movie will most likely turn away anyone remotely ""religious"" and send them out of the house screaming ""Blasphemer"" and running to get holy water to get out the demon that is in pocession of the person's body (oh, the homage to the horror classic was well done)A little too vulgar for me to give it 5 stars.

Otherwise the audience has nothing to really connect with or care about, it would be just another dumb comedy filled with sex jokes.

1633773,A26MJME9IBNETY,B00BEJL69U,StrangePegs,"[7, 13]","In all of its crudity, it was just funny.Not that I'm recommending it for everyone, because I know a lot of people are offended by this type of humor, and This Is The End takes it to Kevin Smith levels of crude and, probably, even beyond. Really, you have to see it to know what I'm talking to about, because I can't talk about it without spoilers.First thing, you really need to have seen Pineapple Express to get some of the jokes in This Is The End. In a lot of ways, TITE is the real life sequel of Pineapple. So, if you've seen Pineapple and liked it, you'll probably like TITE. If you didn't like Pineapple, you definitely shouldn't bother with TITE.The idea is that the end of the world is happening and a group of friends are hiding out together. Let me say that again: a group of ""friends"" are hiding out together to escape the end of the world. Except one of the guys (Jay Baruchel) really doesn't like any of the other people, and none of them really like one of the guys (Danny McBride), especially since he (McBride) wastes half of their food on the first day. It's one of those ""what would happen if you were locked up with your best friends"" kind of scenarios. How long would you maintain?And it all starts with a party where no one notices that the end of the world is happening, which is a joke in-and-of itself and pretty priceless, if you ask me. The Emma Watson's bit (which is shown in the trailer), because she's at the party, too, is hilarious. As is Michael Cera.The thing about a movie like this is that the cast, who all play themselves, really has to be able to make fun of themselves. Parody themselves. Make all the things we think about them larger than life whether those things are true or not. And who knows how much of any of it is true other than those guys, but they were brilliant at it in this film. Especially James Franco. I don't care what people say about him, I'm convinced the man is one of the smartest actors in Hollywood. Hmm... that may not be saying much, so let me say he's just pretty freaking smart.The best part, though, is the writing. What you expect is just some pretty straightforward crude humor, and it's full of that. I mean, the f*(& count is pretty high (did you know that wikipedia has an entry for the movies with the highest uses of that word? I do, now). However, there's some pretty complex and subtle writing going on, too, which is pretty awesome if you can see it under all of the other depravity of the movie. But, again, I can't talk about it without giving it away.So, here at the end, let me just say that if you like this kind of humor, even if it's a guilty pleasure kind of thing, then you should go see this movie. Or, at the very least, plan to rent it.

Seth Rogan wrote and directed this film along with his partner, Evan Goldberg, and the film clearly benefits from having someone so close to the actors involved with all parts of the production.This is the End opens simply enough with Seth Rogan meeting his friend Jay Baruchel at the airport.  They plan to hang out in LA and eventually end up heading to James Franco's new house for a big house-warming party.  The opening act of this film is a cameo-filled (Emma Watson, Rhianna, and Paul Rudd to name a few) laugh fest that just piles on the humor in ways that a big-screen comedy hasn't done since The Hangover in 2009.  The comedy is not just name-dropping cheap laughs though.  Rogan and Franco along with Jonah Hill and Jay Baruchel have permeated their way into celebrity in such a way that they can satirize the entertainment business through self-referential humor.  Rogan has written a screenplay that characteristically paints his characters as corrupted in one way or another by the entertainment industry, and this biting satire plays out far beyond the opening act.Rogan also makes a series of wise choices as both a writer and a director that keep this film from quickly growing stale.  Most notably is his decision to play the rest of the film as a true disaster film.  Once the inevitable apocalypse begins, it is not treated as a joke to introduce more absurdity.  Instead, it is used as a backdrop of real danger designed to continue the motif of contempt that has built up in the characters.  That is not to say the laughs stop coming - that is in no way true.  However, the balance of humor and real danger keep the film fresh and alive.The apocalypse that hits is quickly discovered to be a literal onset of the Book of Revelations complete with the Rapture and the arrival of Satan on Earth.  Such high stakes force the boys to hole up in Franco's house along with Craig Robertson and Danny McBride.  Irreverent humor abounds with some of the meanest, nastiest, low-brow, toilet humor imaginable - all of it hilarious.  Occasionally, the film hits a slight snag in terms of pacing and some of the gross-out humor is tasteless and extreme, but it is hardly at the film's detriment.  The film has a little bit of something for everyone; in fact, even fans of The Backstreet Boys owe this film a tremendous debt of gratitude for preserving a shred of their relevance in cinematic history.Rogan and company have truly tapped into a genre of humor that grows along with them.  In one scene, they try to kill boredom by filming crude home-movie versions of sequels of their own films.  Somebody get to work on this exact version of Pineapple Express 2 immediately!  In fact, This is the End would be a great exclamation point at the end of the ""end of the world"" movie fad that has been so commonly explored in entertainment lately.  However, with World War Z, The World's End, and Elysium still to come this summer along with fall's second installment of The Hunger Games series, it's clear that we are far from done with this genre.

Before that can happen the crew finds themselves dealing with the apocalypse. This will be another short review. This is not a movie you watch for the plot or the acting.

1633798,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B00BEJL69U,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[1, 3]","Movie - 4.5Over the last few years, I've sorta' become divided by the disaster genre. On the one hand, I like seeing the social commentaries within the human interactions, but then it's also kinda' neat to see stuff get destroyed. Regardless of how you put it, though, a lot of these invasion, Apocalypse, or outbreak movies almost always tend to be really serious (unless it was directed by Roland Emmerich). And then I discovered ""This Is the End."" The story is something of a self-deprecating caricature of these Hollywood actors being over-the-top versions of themselves and follows Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, and many others celebs having a housewarming party at Franco's. But when the Apocalypse occurs (yes, the same one that's in the Bible) and things start to go crazy, the lone handful of these surviving actors decide to take shelter within Franco's house in an attempt to live it out. But it's not just the rationing of food and water and the loss of the Internet they have to deal with. They also have to survive.. each other.If you've seen pretty much any comedy film starring any combination of these guys within the last half-decade or so, you should already know what to expect: raunchy humor, lots of cussing, crass back-and-forth banter, the occasional cutoff or dismembered body part, borderline-annoying personal issues, and possibly some drug-induced humor. It can be pretty hit-or-miss. Although, given each of these actors' recent box office numbers, I guess most people like 'em, anyway, so it really just comes down your own personal preference in humor and how much of these guys' personalities you can stomach. Personally, I like the movie a lot. It's sort of a mashup of Pineapples Express (same writers, most of the main cast, and a buddy comedy), Tropic Thunder (a parody of how egotistical Hollywood personalities deal with catastrophe), and just a little bit of Shaun of the Dead (funny, but occasionally gory and tense). If you know these guys' careers, it's probably safe to say you'll like it. If you're not a fan their brand, keep expectations low, give it a rent, and maybe you'll like it, anyway.Video - 4.5- Codec: MPEG-4 AVC- Resolution: 1080p- Aspect ratio: 2.39:1- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1Shot with the Red Epic at a native 5K resolution, the video is dang-near perfect. The director of photography was Brandon Trost whose most recent works I've seen include his collaborations with Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor for Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and Crank: High Voltage. Needless to say, those two movies look amazing, which kinda' surprised me when I learned he'd be the DP for this crazy action-thriller-comedy. And while just about every shot looks extremely sharp, there's only a very minor level of lost detail. A lot of the explanation can be heard in the special features where Trost talks about wanting to give the film a very apparent Apocalyptic vibe, which in turn led to a lot of low-lit shots and an orange/amber color timing. Pretty much the beginning and end of the movie, all of which are outside Franco's house, look pretty good. Otherwise, most of the film has a sort of dingy look with lots of intentional flaring to give it a more dramatic effect (Goldberg and Rogen actually take a small crack at the use of lens flares in the commentary).Additionally, since this is also a kind of a dramady with a decent amount of dialogue, many of the shots and framing involve a good amount of closeups, meaning what could've been worse in terms of video quality actually isn't that bad because the closeness makes up for some the lack in detail. That being said, there's still a lot of texture in faces and objects (though it *really* depends on the camera angle and lighting) and some pretty good line detail and shadow delineation. There's not a whole of light to work with because of the sets, so the result often looks a tad murky. Skin and flesh tones are pretty normal (again, for pretty much any scene not inside Franco's house), but for the most part have a goldish, orangey-Apocalyptic hue to 'em. Also of surprise, a lot of the film's CG looks quite passable (given the nature of the movie). And I'm happy to report that there's no heavy banding, digital noise, artificial sharpening, or any of those anomalies that can sometimes creep their way into digital photography.Audio - 5.0Languages- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1- English: Dolby Digital 5.1- French: Dolby Digital 5.1- English: Dolby Digital 2.0Subtitles- English, FrenchNow here's, where the BD really surprised me. Most action-comedies I've seen that tend to have a lot of.. well, action, on screen never quite reach that level of ""reference"" on my sound system. Films like Tropic Thunder, The Other Guys, and Pineapple Express sound *really* good for comedies, but tend to lack that extra ""oomph"" in the LFEs. Okay, I lied. There is *one* movie that is predominantly a comedy that I can think of that has some pretty awesome sound, and that's Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle. But other than that, most other action-comedies only sound great (instead of jaw-dropping); not so, here, in This Is the End. Mixed, designed, and edited by Michael Babcock, who previously only did additional work in such blockbusters as War of the Worlds, Transformers, The Dark Knight (and Rises), The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Inception, I think it's safe to say the guy had some great-sounding movies to use for reference in his first big gig as the sound boss.There's a pretty decent amount of dialogue in the film with only a small portion of action. But wow, do those sequences sound amazing. As usual, the actual dialogue itself is nice and clear from the center channel with no signs of dropout or other volume issues (kinda' hard to screw that up, I would think). And with the amount of record-label music that they play, the mix actually utilizes a good deal of the rears and sub-woofer (Backstreet Boys and Gangnam Style sound particularly good in lossless). The action sequences, however, are the unsung hero, here. When the earth splits open to create sinkholes, when demons come crashing through stuff, or when chaotic situations arise, it's actually a very high-quality and potent mix that I wasn't expecting at all. Rear channels divi up the sound and create great separation. Dynamics handle very well when transitioning from really quiet parts to really loud ones, and LFEs are deceptively deep when things blow up or a monster pops out of nowhere. It's another one of those cases of ""quality over quantity,"" and, boy, is this mix quality!Extras - 4.5Note: All of the special features are in HD (aside from the commentary, obviously, which is in lossy 2.0).Disc 1- Audio Commentary (Directors Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen)You'd think for a couple of guys who try so hard to be funny that they wouldn't give that great a commentary. Wrong. This commentary is *full* of very useful information covering all the bases from filming, writing, anecdotes, cracking jokes, and any number of interesting trivia. The commentary itself was actually recorded the day before the movie hit theaters, so it was especially neat to hear them be so confident, yet stay so laid back and just spout out all the stuff that they did. This is an extremely jovial and insightful track that actually raised my appreciation for the film a lot more, and I definitely recommend any of you that liked the movie to really give this a listen. Some of the things they talk about were a lot of the improv from the actors that went into certain scenes, how the entire thing was set in L.A., but actually filmed in New Orleans, some of the subtleties that went into the production, trivial facts about the actors, stories about how this or that event led to what you see on screen, jokes about lens flares, and a lot more.- Directing Your Friends (6:30)Talks about how all the main characters know each other, their comfort level in working with/off one another's performances (because of their friendships), and that if they all *weren't* doing it together, that they probably would never have made this movie in the first place.- Meta-Apocalypse (7:43)Most of the actors delve into the reasoning they're playing exaggerated versions of themselves, talk a little bit about how they're *not* like that in real life, and kinda' laugh at the ""character"" versions of themselves and their friends.- Let's Get Technical (10:44)As the title implies, this feature talks about the technical aspects of the movie. In particular, it covers the cinematography with DP Brandon Trost, the stunts with coordinator Steven Ritzi, and then takes a look at some of the visual effects (particularly, the guy they lit on fire 9 times in a day).- Party Time (12:54)Covers the production and design of Franco's house, the stuff inside (like the art and decor), and takes a detailed look at all the celebrity party guests who cameo'd in the film. Additionally, it then covers some of the special effects for when things start to go bonkers in plot.- The Cannibal King (4:25)A kind of outtake reel containing alternate takes of McBride and his pet, Channing Tat-yum, that's simultaneously interspersed with another candid walk-n-talk where McBride and Tatum ad-lib with each other in front of the camera saying they'll be each others' slut anytime they need to.- The Making of ""The Making of Pineapple Express 2"" (6:20)A look at how they made the in-movie trailer for another movie that could very well exist some day, though probably with a different story by then. Contains some deleted material that didn't quite make it into the final version.- Jay & Seth vs. The Apocalypse -- The Original Short (9:58)A pretty serious short that the two actors made back in '07. It's a lot darker than what this movie turned out to be and may very well surprise you.- Line-O-RamaSome pretty hilarious alternate takes with rapid-fire deliveries that utilize a lot of improv and on-the-fly ad-libbing. I honestly had tears rolling down the corners of my eyes for the second and third scenes. Of course, your mileage may vary depending on your sense of humor. The scenes include:Sleepover (1:14)We Don't Know You Man! (3:27)Cum Battle (8:06)- This is the Gag Reel (6:16)A modestly funny gag reel of the people goofing off on set.- Deleted ScenesSome of these scenes weren't even completed. Although, surprisingly enough, some of them weren't that bad. Scenes include:Cocaine with Michael Cera (1:03)The Guys Talk About Kicking Danny Out (2:44)Being Green (1:18)Eulogies for the Dead: Live Together, Die Alone (3:41)Jay and Jonah Talk (3:07)Michael Likes to Go Dancing (1:53)Pre Jonah Exorcism (0:48)The Guys Talk About F#(%ing Each Other (1:18)- This is the MarketingSome funny viral videos to promote the movie that they posted around the Internet, on TV, or in theaters:Marketing Outtakes (6:38)Aziz Haunts Craig (1:02)James and Danny Confessional (1:17)Jonah Confessional (1:16)Seth and Jay Confessional (0:56)The Cast (3:43)Red Band Sizzle Trailer (1:52)Disc 2 (Best Buy has an exclusive BD bonus disc; this is what's on on it, if you're curious)- James Franco's House (8:36)A more in-depth look at how production designer Chris Spellman built Franco's house, which is *not* what his house is really like at all (Franco points out in the interview that he has an apartment in New York in the Lower East Side). However, a lot of the art you see (particularly the paintings) were, in fact, made by Franco, himself.- The Making of This Is the End (14:28)A conglomerate of a lotta' the special features already presented on disc 1, but in a different order. It's not that much more insightful. Although, there's a tiny bit of the footage that's actually not rehash. Worth a look every now and then, but not detrimental to really appreciating the film (unlike the stellar commentary).Overall - 4.5I really wanted to see this in theaters, but never made the time. However, getting this movie as an almost complete blind-buy was well worth the price. If you like these guys and know what kind of comedy to expect, you'll probably find it an absolutely hilarious time. It's chock full of dirty humor, foul language, and some nice references to other movies. But it's also surprisingly tense and actiony, at times. With near-reference video, definitive-reference audio, and a very enjoyable set of special features, I think it was well-worth the money spent.

Much of the humour in it is especially relatable since I got most of the pop culture references and iconic points about Los Angeles (the Carl's Jr. in the beginning that is near the strip club and LAX). The film, as a whole, is hilarious and absurd in many ways and because of its multiple styles of comedy used (screwball, sex/blue humour, dark/black humour, religious satire), it would be a little difficult to pidgeon-hole.Thankfully, after years of the same-old comedies (*cough, Hangover, * cough), here is something (along with 2012's The Watch), that manages to create something bizarre and random like a Monty Python skit but longer, funnier, and much more fun (when many of Hollywood's famous and most recent comedians star and come to shine and dive here). Without spoiling too much but watching Aziz Ansari and Kevin Hart in the same scene and Seth Rogen celebrating and drinking fancily with water were some very hilarious moments that are not likely to be forgotten from this point on.This is the End, in all its wild, stoner glory, serves as a much better and more interesting take on the kind of 2012 paranoia than the Steve Carrell/Keira Knightley dramedy Seeking a Friend for the End of the World. Soon, we will have to see how Simon Pegg and Nick Frost kick it off with The World's End.""",4,"One of the most hilarious, bizarre, and OTT dark/stoner/screwball comedies in recent years. 10x better than The Hangover!",1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,1809,"['Jay', 'Baruchel', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'James', 'Franco', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Craig', 'Robinson', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'play', 'exaggerated', 'versions', 'zany', 'very', 'acid-trip', 'comedy', 'emergence', 'Book', 'Revelations-like', 'apocalypse', 'coming', 'Los', 'Angeles.As', 'part', 'free', 'test', 'screening', 'selected', 'British', 'cinemas', 'coming', 'film', 'much', 'expectation', 'notice', 'film', 'not', 'disappoint', 'even', 'harder', 'scratch', 'head', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'expecting', 'unexpected', 'Much', 'humour', 'especially', 'relatable', 'got', 'most', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'iconic', 'points', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Carl', 'Jr.', 'beginning', 'strip', 'club', 'LAX', 'film', 'whole', 'hilarious', 'absurd', 'many', 'ways', 'multiple', 'styles', 'comedy', 'used', 'screwball', 'sex/blue', 'humour', 'dark/black', 'humour', 'religious', 'satire', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'difficult', 'pidgeon-hole.Thankfully', 'years', 'same-old', 'comedies', 'Hangover', '*', 'cough', 'here', 'something', '2012', 'Watch', 'create', 'something', 'bizarre', 'random', 'Monty', 'Python', 'skit', 'longer', 'funnier', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'when', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'famous', 'most', 'recent', 'comedians', 'star', 'come', 'shine', 'dive', 'here', 'spoiling', 'too', 'much', 'watching', 'Aziz', 'Ansari', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'same', 'scene', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'celebrating', 'drinking', 'fancily', 'water', 'were', 'very', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'are', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'forgotten', 'point', 'on.This', 'End', 'wild', 'stoner', 'glory', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'interesting', 'take', 'kind', '2012', 'paranoia', 'Steve', 'Carrell/Keira', 'Knightley', 'dramedy', 'Seeking', 'Friend', 'End', 'World', 'Soon', 'will', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'kick', 'off', 'World', 'End']",This is the End
