With that being said, this film does have some funny jokes and thanks to Michael Rosenbaum, he keeps this sex comedy from sinking fast. Rosenbaum has great comic timing which isn't always apparent since he plays Lex Luthor on Smallville, he gets to show his funny bone and he is a hoot! Barry Watson is quite pretty as a girl but this film is no Animal House. This film is a guilty pleasure, so it keep it a secret.

Maybe it's because the film feels so wrong that it works, but I can't help but admit that this is semi-enjoyable and definitely NOT the worst way to waste an afternoon.  Some of the gags are preposterous, and the `let's learn a lesson' ending is totally wasted on the remainder of the film (let's be honest, this film wasn't made to `make a difference') but the overall effect of the film is one of enjoyment.  Harland Williams is hilariously dim-witted and Heather Matarazzo is pretty hot, even as a nerd.  The love story that develops between Matarazzo and Barry Watson is unrealistic (this whole film is unrealistic, but what else did you expect) but it's expected and so you can't fault it too much (guys and girls cannot coexist without `something' blossoming).  Alas, it's a guilty pleasure but one that is worth indulging in at least once.

But on a very stressed out day for me, where my brain was overexhausted by work on this computer, I must confess this film did the trick.  I enjoyed and laughed at this slight confection of three frat guys who are forced to pledge the girl's sorority on campus which houses all the &quot;dog&quot; girls. The 3 of them are members of the biggest hell raising frat on campus but they must lurk undercover while being suspected of stealing the frat's cruise fund.  The reason this works is that the 3 lead guys are surprisingly likable and cute, whether in drag or out. The one who was the worst with the ladies has one of his own frat brothers pursue him as a woman and it is very funny when he walks the frat's Hall of Shame.

708960,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00006ADFT,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[1, 1]","This comedy is nothing new to those of you who've seen the onslaught of teen, campy, sex-filled comedies.  I will say thought that despite all that, this film is still good for a few laughs, none of which are forced, and it's a nice deversion to a rainy afternoon.  Barry Watson, Harland Williams & Michael Rosenbaum play three alumni in the KOK house, a franernity who specializes of getting high and humiliating college girls.  Heather Matarazzo plays the leader of the DOG house, a fraternity filled with the 'ugly' girls that are fighting for woman rights.  When are three male sexist's get tossed out of the KOK house after being accused of stealing money they are forced to join the DOG house, posing as girls, in order to retreave a video tape from the KOK house that proves their innocence.  Neather of the boys look like women in drag but the fact that they don't is what makes it so funny.  While no where near as funny as 'White Chicks' it still, as I mentioned, delivers some honest laughs.  The first half of the film is a bit redundant for we've all seen the college comedy when the guys act like pigs and sleep with girl after girl...so it's not until they get dragged out that the film delivers for me.  The romance that forms between Barry Watson's character and Heather Matarazzo (who by the way is NO UGLY GIRL) is ammusing and the DOG circle scene when they tell something about themselves is hilarious.  Personally I feel that Harland Williams delivers the most laughs for many reasons, the most notable being how absolutly hidious he is in drag (or out for that matter) but with that mop of red locks he takes the cake for most humorus to look at.  This film won't inspire you and it won't make your favorite funny movies list, but it will make you chuckle, at least a little bit...(and I'll mention that the voice of the leader of the KOK house is so incredibly annoying that it's funny...really funny!)",3,One-trick-pony,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,1926,"['comedy', 'nothing', 'new', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'onslaught', 'teen', 'campy', 'sex-filled', 'comedies', 'will', 'say', 'thought', 'film', 'still', 'good', 'few', 'laughs', 'none', 'are', 'forced', 'nice', 'deversion', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'Harland', 'Williams', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'play', 'three', 'alumni', 'KOK', 'house', 'franernity', 'who', 'getting', 'high', 'humiliating', 'college', 'girls', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'leader', 'DOG', 'house', 'fraternity', 'filled', ""'ugly"", 'girls', 'are', 'fighting', 'woman', 'rights', 'When', 'are', 'three', 'male', 'sexist', 'get', 'tossed', 'KOK', 'house', 'being', 'accused', 'stealing', 'money', 'are', 'forced', 'join', 'DOG', 'house', 'posing', 'girls', 'order', 'retreave', 'video', 'tape', 'KOK', 'house', 'innocence', 'Neather', 'boys', 'look', 'women', 'drag', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'what', 'so', 'funny', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'funny', ""'White"", 'Chicks', 'still', 'mentioned', 'honest', 'laughs', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'bit', 'redundant', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'college', 'comedy', 'when', 'guys', 'act', 'pigs', 'sleep', 'girl', 'girl', 'not', 'get', 'dragged', 'out', 'film', 'delivers', 'romance', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'character', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'who', 'way', 'NO', 'UGLY', 'GIRL', 'ammusing', 'DOG', 'circle', 'scene', 'when', 'tell', 'something', 'hilarious', 'Personally', 'feel', 'Harland', 'Williams', 'most', 'laughs', 'many', 'reasons', 'most', 'notable', 'being', 'how', 'absolutly', 'hidious', 'drag', 'matter', 'mop', 'red', 'locks', 'cake', 'most', 'humorus', 'look', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'inspire', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'favorite', 'funny', 'movies', 'list', 'will', 'make', 'chuckle', 'least', 'little', 'bit', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'voice', 'leader', 'KOK', 'house', 'so', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'funny', 'really', 'funny']",Sorority Boys

However, it was very difficult to hold still because of laughing so hard.  I felt really bad about moving too much, but some scenes became impossible to prevent this.Three fraternity brothers are terminated from their house due to theft suspicions.  To prove their innocence, they must find the videotape.  The only way they can sneak into the house is to pose as women.  When karma kicks them in the a**, they realize the truths of their past behavior, especially toward women.  Many twists and turns build the story's theme as the three men struggle to keep their identities a secret from their new sorority.Most of &quot;Sorority Boys&quot; may sound unrealistic to most people due to its provocative theme.  Its humor makes up for everything.  No dull moment was released in this film.  The producers and the writers know how to keep the audience's eyes wide open to the film.  Throughout, it teaches all of the stereotypes made against women and frat men.  Some may call this education an eyeopener, some may just call it unusual humor.

They're first plan is to sneak into their frat house during a party and they dress up as girls to try to accomplish that but are foiled as they are kicked out and left outside the doorstep of the FOG sorority, a sorority of ""outcast"" girls, who take in the guys thinking they are plus size girls.I went into this movie thinking it was going to stink but it turned out to be really funny. Trust me the 3 guys dressed as the girls are pretty funny plus there's just some really outlandishly funny scenes in this one.

Now graduating to the college level, I find a movie that's much, much worse. If ""The New Guy"", who's lead character is more charismatic than anything in this movie gets one star, where is there to go when you find this one?I don't have a problem with gross-out or infantile humor. Chris Rock does it well, and even Dice Clay knows what buttons to push to cut through our civilized defenses. In the movies, when Mel Gibson leaves a condom tree on Danny Glover's desk, it works because the absurdity is presented in contrast to an otherwise sane world.That's not the case in this movie, where EVERYBODY seems stupid. I know we are expected to cut some slack when Dustin Hoffman and Babs Streisand don't really look like the opposite sex in their movies. But this movie doesn't even try to do a good job of disguising them. They just plop on bad wigs and [bad] clothes, and that's it. When the ladies also occasionally need a shave, it shows how much the filmmakers care about a good product.Which leaves the other actors, who are saddled with wooden stupidity to begin with, with a tougher job. They now have to pretend that these creatures with broad shoulders, prominent Adam's apples, and five-o'clock shadows are perfectly acceptable in a women's shower, can be accepted in a sorority, and are material to be hit on.Oh yes, it does have nudity, which I suppose is the draw for a lot of people.

708968,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B00006ADFT,Get What We Give,"[4, 6]","Sorority Boys is a movie that we've seen done a dozen different ways over the years - - and yet, it is a fresh retelling of the tale.  Hilariously so.In a very brief nutshell, the plot is this:  When three of the most popular brothers of the fraternity KOK (get it? - it's very lame, but let it alone), are accused of stealing all the money required to throw a huge shindig, they are thrown out of the fraternity.  In a half-baked attempt to retrieve a video tape that shows the real culprit, the three dress as girls and try to infiltrate the KOK frat house.  They fail and are somehow invited to join the DOG sorority (lame again, but leave it alone) where they will plan their revenge on their frat.First of all, this movie shares no ground with reality.  Just know that going in and you will have a heck of a good time watching this movie.  It is part ""Animal House,"" part ""What's Love Got to Do with It?,"" and part ""Some Like it Hot.""  Of the three boys who go in drag, Barry Watson (of TV's 7th Heaven) is the only one who might remotely be convincing as a girl.  It seems that no real concerted attempt was made to disguise or cover up the boys' dark beard traces.  It is almost a wink to the audience that we are watching camp and that the whole film is for fun.  Indeed, the other characters never seem to notice the beards or the adam's apples present in the boys.  We are even supposed to believe that one of the boys continually showers with a near sighted sorority sister without the girl ever discovering what is really ""poking her in the bottom.""  The actors seem to have a lot of fun with their ""female"" selves and play their parts deftly.  It is quite funny to watch one of the characters fuss over his perceived ""fat *ss,"" while Watson knowingly admits he makes a beautiful woman.  You would think that a film of this caliber would have shown its best scenes in the trailers, but that is not the case here.This movie is absolutely hilarious in many instances and is also ridiculously silly throughout.  The filmmakers knew this when they made it.  The actors knew it when they were making it.  Well, then, the audience should know that when they view it.  It is a fun movie!The nod to ""Animal House"" is apparent to someone as old as I am in that two of the actors from that film are prominently featured in cameo roles:  the Dean of Students from Animal House plays a lascivious old man in this film; and Niedermieir from Animal House appears as the ""go to"" man for Barry Watson's character in his search for employment after he graduates.The one big misfire in this film is the fact that Watson's character's job acceptance and his later revealing his alter ego are never tied together.  Somehow it seems one should have had something to do with the other.But this film isn't about a deep plot.  It's a film with an actual plot that was created as a vehicle for some immensely entertaining schtick and some more than decent acting and comedy.I think you'll like this one!",3,"Hilarious - Ridiculous!, but Hilarious!",1035417600,"10 24, 2002",2002,2990,"['Sorority', 'Boys', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'dozen', 'different', 'ways', 'years', 'yet', 'fresh', 'retelling', 'tale', 'Hilariously', 'very', 'brief', 'nutshell', 'plot', 'When', 'three', 'most', 'popular', 'brothers', 'fraternity', 'KOK', 'get', 'very', 'lame', 'let', 'alone', 'are', 'accused', 'stealing', 'money', 'required', 'throw', 'huge', 'shindig', 'are', 'thrown', 'fraternity', 'half-baked', 'attempt', 'retrieve', 'video', 'tape', 'real', 'culprit', 'three', 'dress', 'girls', 'try', 'infiltrate', 'KOK', 'frat', 'house', 'fail', 'are', 'somehow', 'invited', 'join', 'DOG', 'sorority', 'lame', 'again', 'leave', 'alone', 'where', 'will', 'plan', 'revenge', 'frat.First', 'movie', 'shares', 'ground', 'reality', 'Just', 'know', 'going', 'will', 'have', 'heck', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'part', 'Animal', 'House', 'part', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Do', 'part', 'Hot', 'three', 'boys', 'who', 'go', 'drag', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'TV', '7th', 'Heaven', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'might', 'remotely', 'be', 'convincing', 'girl', 'real', 'concerted', 'attempt', 'was', 'made', 'disguise', 'cover', 'up', 'boys', 'dark', 'beard', 'traces', 'almost', 'wink', 'audience', 'are', 'watching', 'camp', 'whole', 'film', 'fun', 'Indeed', 'other', 'characters', 'never', 'seem', 'notice', 'beards', 'adam', 'apples', 'present', 'boys', 'are', 'even', 'supposed', 'believe', 'one', 'boys', 'continually', 'showers', 'near', 'sighted', 'sorority', 'sister', 'girl', 'ever', 'discovering', 'what', 'really', 'poking', 'bottom', 'actors', 'seem', 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'female', 'selves', 'play', 'parts', 'deftly', 'quite', 'funny', 'watch', 'one', 'characters', 'fuss', 'perceived', 'fat', '*ss', 'Watson', 'knowingly', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'would', 'think', 'film', 'caliber', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'best', 'scenes', 'trailers', 'not', 'case', 'here.This', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'many', 'instances', 'also', 'ridiculously', 'silly', 'filmmakers', 'knew', 'when', 'made', 'actors', 'knew', 'when', 'were', 'making', 'Well', 'then', 'audience', 'should', 'know', 'when', 'view', 'fun', 'movie', 'nod', 'Animal', 'House', 'apparent', 'someone', 'as', 'old', 'am', 'two', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'prominently', 'featured', 'cameo', 'roles', 'Dean', 'Students', 'Animal', 'House', 'lascivious', 'old', 'man', 'film', 'Niedermieir', 'Animal', 'House', 'go', 'man', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'character', 'search', 'employment', 'graduates.The', 'one', 'big', 'misfire', 'film', 'fact', 'Watson', 'character', 'job', 'acceptance', 'later', 'revealing', 'alter', 'ego', 'are', 'never', 'tied', 'together', 'Somehow', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'other.But', 'film', ""n't"", 'deep', 'plot', 'film', 'actual', 'plot', 'was', 'created', 'vehicle', 'immensely', 'entertaining', 'schtick', 'more', 'decent', 'acting', 'comedy.I', 'think', ""'ll"", 'like', 'one']",Sorority Boys

Well, suffice it to say that I ended up watching this movie and to be perfectly honest...it wasn't that bad.The premise has been reported in other reviews, but I'll briefly mention it.  Three fraternity guys are kicked out of their fraternity under suspicion of stealing the money from the event planning fund.  They suspect the fraternity president.  They dress up as women to try to sneak into the house and find the evidence of the theft, but since they are so ugly they are ejected from the house and end up on the lawn of the neighboring sorority house: D.O.G., a house of social rejects.  In order to have a better opportunity to learn the truth, they pledge D.O.G. (they were invited in by the sorority president).  The rest of the movie deals with the three guys living as women in a house of the campus rejects.  Naturally they grow up a little and see things in a different light.The movie sounded like it was going to be very dumb and not funny at all.  I was wrong.

Sadly you can hype it all you want but a turkey is still a turkey.  Some boys get unfairly kicked out of a fraternity and take refuge in a sorority across the road while they plot how to obtain the evidence that would clear their name and reputations.  Along the way they alternately fall in love, bond with the ""ugly"" sorority and expose their fraternity brothers for being the date-raping morons we all new they were at the start.This movie has a few good set pieces and scenes, but ultimately we've come to expect a lot more from the teen movie these days on the back of such seminal films as American Pie and Road Trip.  This movie is sadly nowhere near in the league of those two.  The actors lack charisma, the plot drags and lacks sparkle, and the whole concept is so widely outside the realms of possibility it just irritates.The scariest things about this movie though are its social commentary undercurrents.  Get this, the ""feminist"" sorority is full of ugly militant lesbian chicks who secretly despise themselves and each other and only come to believe in themselves by beating the ""beautiful sorority"" at Football.  They seek validation for themselves by attracting frankly lame frat boys and are heartbroken when this does not materialize, ostensibly because of the fact they're all fairly ugly and badly dressed.

708975,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,B00006ADFT,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[3, 3]","The plot of Sorority Boys can best be summed up as: Animal House meets Revenge Of The Nerds meets Tootsie, plus lashings of American Pie thrown in for good measure.In an unnamed university campus somewhere in America, there is a fraternity called Kappa Omicron Kappa (""KOK"" - yes, we all get the joke) filled with rejects from Animal House. They hold wild parties where they invite the beautiful girls from the Tri Pi sorority. Any girl caught sleeping with stud jock Adam (Michael Rosenbaum) gets to do the Walk Of Shame the next day where she gets jeered by frat brothers lining up on the corridor outside Adam's room and her photograph taken for posterity. Ugly girls are not allowed, and there are special teams of ""dog catchers"" to roust them out.Needless to say, all is not well. Adam and his roommates Dave (Barry Watson) - the ""smart"" one - and Doofer (Harland Williams) - the big and dumb one - are accused of pilfering the frat funds and are expelled from KOK by the snivelling president Spence (Brad Beyer) - who has a weird voice and pompadour hairstyle to give us a hint that he's going to be the bad guy.The boys are in trouble, for if they don't belong in the fraternity, then they won't be able to attend the annual Cocktail Cruise where they get to mingle with ex-frat members (in most cases their parents) who have graduated and have since become industry power figures. And if they don't attend the cruise they won't have the opportunity to secure plum jobs using the Old Boys Network and they may be doomed to live lives of obscurity and poverty!In desperation, they dress up as girls to sneak back into the fraternity in order to retrieve a video tape which may hold crucial evidence that demonstrates their innocence and identify the real culprit who have stolen the money. Needless to say, they get nabbed by the dog catchers and deposited in front of the Delta Omicron Gamma sorority (""DOG"" - yawn).DOG contains the female equivalents of nerds and geeks - ugly girls, big girls, girls with loud annoying voices, ethnic girls, ... The president of DOG, Leah (Melissa Sagemiller), takes pity on them and invites them to pledge with the sorority. At first they refuse, but then when they found out they get free lodging and food ...The rest of the film are full of jokes involving the guys trying to act as women and survive on campus, bonding with the girls in the sorority, discovering their feminine sides, and finding out that life is not so easy if you are a DOG. All the degrading things they did to DOGs are now being done to them, especially when a young KOK takes a fancy to ""Adina"" (Adam) and we know that eventually Adam will have to experience the Walk of Shame!I liked the premise of the boys discovering their female sides and what life is like for the other sex, and the film certainly had a lot of opportunity to explore some interesting issues. But no, the filmmakers have decided to go for the lowest common denominator and exploited just about every clich&eacute; in the genre. In the end, we get something that is tedious and disappointing rather than something original and witty.What would have made the film really interesting is if at least one of the boys discovers that he prefers living as a woman (preferably all three), and then the rest of the film could explore how this affects their relationships with each other and the other characters. We certainly come tantalisingly close - one of the boys is on the verge of entering into a lesbian relationship, another has the opportunity to experience a relationship with a man, and the third discovers the the joys of sisterhood bonding. But just as things become interesting, the film backs down and we're all back in Kansas.

It's been said by others that Heather Matarazzo shouldn't be cast as an ugly girl, which is highly true. As a matter of fact, none of the girls in the D.O.G. house would ever be considered ugly. Still, the actresses, in the main speaking roles, manage to make the most that they can and can speak to anyone who has suffered the cruelty of being considered ugly. The less said of the fraternity brothers the better, though I must say that the voice of the president is really, really irritating. As for the the three main guys/girls, they're all likeable. Harland Williams is probably the least funny of the main three, but this probably stems from the fact that he has to play the guy who's been in college forever role and he's stuck with a really hideous wig. Barry Watson is probably the least likeable because he doesn't seem as fixated on women, especially women as objects. Still, he isn't the funniest person in the movie. That title has to go to Michael Rosenbaum. As Adam/Adina, Rosenbaum shows considerable comedic skills and personally is the one guy who manages to look fairly close to a girl.I do have one problem with the movie. I dislike the way that Women Studies courses are shown in the movie. They aren't just for women and they aren't sexist, like the one shown in the movie. As a matter of fact, the class undermines to some extent the positive women message.So, it isn't Citizen Kane. It is a good way to spend an afternoon or evening.

Some losers get into trouble (need money, are going to be kicked out of school, want to get chicks/guys), so they design some hairbrained scheme to solve their problems.  Gross-out humor ensues as losers struggle through what turned out to be an awful plan, and they begin to realize that they've misjudged something all along.  Then they have some kind of contest or game to finally win their prize (whatever that may be) and learn a valuable lesson in the end.We have seen this SO many times (just think about comedies like Van Wilder, Road Trip, Old School, etc).  That doesn't necessarily mean that we should not watch these movies.  Sometimes it's fun to watch a mindless movie so we don't have to think.  Sorority Boys is the opportunity to do just that.Here's what qualifies in the formula for this movie.  1. The Trouble:  Three frat brothers of Kappa Omicron Kappa (Barry Watson, Michael Rosenbaum, Harland Williams) get kicked out of their house after they were suspected of stealing fundraiser money.  They must get proof that they were set up by the annoying fraternity president.  2. The Hairbrained Scheme: Dress up in drag and join an unpopular sorority called Delta Omicron Gamma (DOG...get it?).  3. Gross-out Humor:  Projectile sex toys, fake boobs, liaisons with unsuspecting frat boys, etc.  4. Realization:  These ""ugly"" girls they used to make fun of are not as ugly or as repulsive as they thought.  5. Game to win prize:  Touch football contest with snobby Tri Pi sorority.  6. Valuable Lesson:  People cannot be judged by their looks.There are a few funny moments in this film, I won't deny that.  But I can't really say this was an original effort.  It also bothers me that this R-rated sex romp may have been targeted toward a younger audience with the casting of Watson, star of the popular squeaky-clean WB series 7th Heaven.  It does get quite raunchy in a few spots.While I think someone could enjoy Sorority Boys if they suspend their disbelief for about an hour and a half (because, let's face it, there is no WAY these men would pass for women in reality), I do feel that this gross-out genre itself is getting tired.

That's the money (and two hours) I wasted on Sorority Boys after reading a positive review of the movie. No, I wasn't expecting ""The Age of Innocence"" from this film, but there have been some ""guys in drag"" classics over the years and I thought maybe this might be fun. This movie is incredibly bad, I don't know where to begin. It's embarrassingly bad. Frankly, it's downright STUPID.This is a Hollywood movie, so it must have had a decent budget. But being creative with money was obviously beyond the director and producers' grasp. The three actors in drag are so badly made up with cheap wigs and unbelievable costumes that you'd have to be a complete imbecile to think that they were actually women!!! I've seen community theaters do a better job than this. And all the characters in this movie believe that they are women; are they blind! Is it a star trek time flux! After all, the movie does take place at a college as opposed to an insane assylum.OK, so realism isn't one of this movie's fortes! I'm still flabbergasted that ladies who have commented on this movie didn't find the cheap comic exploitation of women (wet tee shirts, ugly girls referred to as dogs, girls with facial hair etc. etc.) in the film appalling!It's equally distressing to have to sit through the film's sleazy working of an audience's assumed homophobia. I wonder how many viewers stayed to the end of the credits for the big surprise cannibalism scene!!!!. Funny! No. Stupid! Yes!This movie might have made a pleasant diversion with a better script and a better director. There's nothing wrong with the premise.

Ladies and gentlemen, I offer you prosecution exhibit A, Sorority Boys. First, why Wallace Wolodarsky was given a camera again after the farce that was Coldblooded is utterly beyond me (the only saving grace is that Hollywod took seven years to green-light him again after that debacle). Second, I don't care how good Melissa Sagemiller looks (and she looks even better here than she did in the awful Soul Survivors), she can't save a film on sex appeal alone. Third, when your talent pool's three male leads are veterans of such classic cinematic fare as Co-ed Call Girl (Barry Watson), Urban Legend (Michael Rosenbaum), and Freddy Got Fingered (Harland Williams), you know you're not going to be producing the next Citizen Kane. (As a side note, pity poor Heather Matarazzo, whose career is taking the Keanu Reeves track: start out in some of the most critically-acclaimed films of the decade, make a few mindless comedies, and spend more than a decade trying to repair the damage done. Matarazzo has a slight chance with the potentially fine film 10029, coming out next year... if anyone ever sees it.)Then add a classic plot. In this case, three losers (Watson, Rosenbaum, Williams) are unable to join their fraternity of choice, despite one's father being an alumnus. So, instead, in order to get revenge, they cross-dress and join a rival sorority. With the expected results. Very expected, in fact. Not a joke here that we haven't already heard a hundred times or so in other films (though admittedly, a few of them still get laughs). Not a plot twist left untied. Not a trick left unpaid. You name it, if it's a clich&eacute; about bad teen comedy, it applies.The one redeeming feature of this movie isn't in the movie at all, actually. One of the extras on the DVD is a montage of behind-the-scenes shots filmed form the points of view of the director, makeup artist, etc. using portable fiber-optic cameras. Now THIS is a load of fun. Far more than the film itself, actually, and the directors of other, better things would do well to take note.
