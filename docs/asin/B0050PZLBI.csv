1435975,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B0050PZLBI,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","A boy of 11 (Kevin Corcoran as Johnny Shiloh) plays at being a drummer with a small northern detachment as they train in a barn yard.  It is the Civil War and this contingent is awaiting their marching orders.  They are soon given an assignment and of course plan to leave little Johnny behind.  He was, after all, just a mascot; they only allowed him to hang around for sentimentality sake.  But now that they are about to go to war he must be left behind.  Unfortunately, Johnny doesn't know the meaning of the word no.  Johnny will go to any length to be a soldier, including disobeying direct orders from his father, friends, and military commanders.  When it finally becomes clear that they still can't shake him loose, they then try to drill him to death (with every intention of ditching him at their earliest convenience).  Johnny will have none of that though, doggedly pursuing his friends to the ends of the Earth if necessary, hoping to wear them down.  ""Can't we just keep him?""  As though war was a game and amusing this boy at all cost was the only objective.  Clearly, petulance can be rewarded.  He gets to stay and be shot at just like the rest.  Although I failed to see any advantage in that.This is an odd film about a horrific war that depicts this war in such a blas&eacute; fashion you begin to wonder if this is actually an antiwar film.  It was made while the Vietnam War was in full bloom.  And according to this film, everyone's so chummy that you wonder what all the fuss was about.  When a person feels the need to apologize to the person they shot during a battle you begin to wonder if the filmmakers were trying to make a perfectly idiotic point.The problem with this film is that it is altogether too pleasant and amiable.  Obviously this was meant to be a kid friendly version of something that was anything but.",3,Persistence pays off,1403740800,"06 26, 2014",2014,1847,"['boy', '11', 'Kevin', 'Corcoran', 'Johnny', 'Shiloh', 'being', 'drummer', 'small', 'northern', 'detachment', 'train', 'barn', 'yard', 'Civil', 'War', 'contingent', 'awaiting', 'marching', 'orders', 'are', 'soon', 'given', 'assignment', 'course', 'plan', 'leave', 'little', 'Johnny', 'behind', 'was', 'just', 'mascot', 'only', 'allowed', 'hang', 'around', 'sentimentality', 'sake', 'now', 'are', 'go', 'war', 'must', 'be', 'left', 'Unfortunately', 'Johnny', ""n't"", 'know', 'meaning', 'word', 'Johnny', 'will', 'go', 'length', 'be', 'soldier', 'including', 'disobeying', 'direct', 'orders', 'father', 'friends', 'military', 'commanders', 'When', 'finally', 'clear', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'loose', 'then', 'try', 'drill', 'death', 'intention', 'ditching', 'earliest', 'convenience', 'Johnny', 'will', 'have', 'none', 'doggedly', 'pursuing', 'friends', 'ends', 'Earth', 'necessary', 'hoping', 'wear', 'down', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'keep', 'war', 'was', 'game', 'amusing', 'boy', 'cost', 'was', 'only', 'objective', 'Clearly', 'petulance', 'can', 'be', 'rewarded', 'stay', 'be', 'shot', 'just', 'rest', 'failed', 'see', 'advantage', 'that.This', 'odd', 'film', 'horrific', 'war', 'war', 'such', 'blas', 'eacute', 'fashion', 'begin', 'wonder', 'actually', 'antiwar', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'was', 'full', 'bloom', 'according', 'film', 'everyone', 'so', 'chummy', 'wonder', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', 'When', 'person', 'need', 'apologize', 'person', 'shot', 'battle', 'begin', 'wonder', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'perfectly', 'idiotic', 'point.The', 'problem', 'film', 'altogether', 'too', 'pleasant', 'amiable', 'Obviously', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'kid', 'friendly', 'version', 'something', 'was', 'anything']",N/A

There was a real alive boy named Johnny Clem, who served as a drummer boy, and as a courier for the Northern Army.  The Disney organization was master at portraying genuine historical characters, and this DVD is no exception.  I have been to historical sites in Nashville Tennessee, and the Stones Riverhistorical battlefield, where Johnny Clem, later nicknamed, Johnny Shiloh, served.  Kevin Corcoran acted as 11 year old Johnny Clem, as well as Eddy Hodges who acted as a young boy in the Army of the South. The cast is full of surprises for actors in this production.  This movie presents the realities of the civil war from the eyes of young boys, and the positive aspects of duty and honor, which I had an appreciation for as a young 1st Class Boy Scout when I first viewed this in my youth.
