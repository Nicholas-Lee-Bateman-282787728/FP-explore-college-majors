702724,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000067IX3,A. Estes,"[9, 11]","To celebrate their fourth studio album, 2001's ""Morning View,"" Incubus performed this initimate, twelve song concert in front of a small crowd of fans and thus, ""The Morning View Sessions"" is born. The concert itself is incentive enough to buy the DVD. The band goes through twelve of their best songs, mostly material coming from the aformentioned ""Morning View"" and their break-through ""Make Yourself,"" but as a little treat, the band also busts out two unexpected songs from the ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E."" album (""New Skin"" and ""Glass""). The overall atmosphere of the concert is peaceful, as the crowd mostly stays quiet while the band performs for them. Every now and then Brandon will make a comment to the crowd, but overall, crowd participation is low, which actually isn't a bad thing, as we can really hear the band shine. The band, in top form (with original bassist Dirk Lance in tow), rip through the set so flawlessly and make it look so easy. The song selection is great, and the way they alter a few songs (albeit, very minor alterations) helps keep it more entertaining. In addition to the concert, this DVD surprisingly has a lot of bonus footage. For starters, we get the original cut of the ""Wish You Were Here"" video, which was banned by MTV after September 11th (amazing how ridiculous the censorship got, the video isn't bad at all), along with a making-of piece for the video. But the big treat is the behind the scenes footage of the making of ""Morning View."" You have to look around a bit in the menu to find all of it, but the footage is very entertaining and often informative, as we follow the band around in the beautiful house they stayed in to record the album. Overall, it's an excellent release from Incubus, who really haven't put out a bad thing yet. The concert is great, and the supplemental stuff just makes it all that much better. If you are an Incubus fan, I recommend this, along with their two other DVD's.",5,A Must Have For The Incubus Fan,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,1939,"['celebrate', 'fourth', 'studio', 'album', '2001', 'Morning', 'View', 'Incubus', 'performed', 'initimate', 'twelve', 'song', 'concert', 'front', 'small', 'crowd', 'fans', 'thus', 'Morning', 'View', 'Sessions', 'born', 'concert', 'incentive', 'enough', 'buy', 'DVD', 'band', 'twelve', 'best', 'songs', 'mostly', 'material', 'coming', 'aformentioned', 'Morning', 'View', 'break-through', 'Make', 'little', 'treat', 'band', 'also', 'out', 'two', 'unexpected', 'songs', 'S.C.I.E.N.C.E', 'album', 'New', 'Skin', 'Glass', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'concert', 'peaceful', 'crowd', 'mostly', 'quiet', 'band', 'performs', 'now', 'then', 'Brandon', 'will', 'make', 'comment', 'crowd', 'overall', 'crowd', 'participation', 'low', 'actually', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'can', 'really', 'hear', 'band', 'shine', 'band', 'top', 'form', 'original', 'bassist', 'Dirk', 'Lance', 'tow', 'rip', 'set', 'so', 'flawlessly', 'make', 'look', 'so', 'easy', 'song', 'selection', 'great', 'way', 'alter', 'few', 'songs', 'very', 'minor', 'alterations', 'keep', 'more', 'entertaining', 'addition', 'concert', 'DVD', 'surprisingly', 'lot', 'bonus', 'footage', 'starters', 'get', 'original', 'cut', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'video', 'was', 'banned', 'MTV', 'September', '11th', 'amazing', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'censorship', 'got', 'video', ""n't"", 'bad', 'making-of', 'piece', 'video', 'big', 'treat', 'scenes', 'footage', 'making', 'Morning', 'View', 'have', 'look', 'around', 'bit', 'menu', 'find', 'footage', 'very', 'entertaining', 'often', 'informative', 'follow', 'band', 'around', 'beautiful', 'house', 'stayed', 'record', 'album', 'Overall', 'excellent', 'release', 'Incubus', 'who', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'put', 'out', 'bad', 'thing', 'yet', 'concert', 'great', 'supplemental', 'stuff', 'just', 'that', 'much', 'better', 'are', 'Incubus', 'fan', 'recommend', 'two', 'other', 'DVD']",Incubus - The Morning View Sessions
702725,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B000067IX3,Brett Corkins,"[4, 5]","This, as you may have already read, was a very intimate little show made to promote Morning View. The live footage is as good as it gets, and the sound is flawless to boot. This DVD really gives you a good idea at how amazing Incubus is live. Most all of the songs sound as if it was the band merely pretending to play while the studio version plays over the speakers. Every song is a favorite of mine, and I absolutely love the way Brandon mixed things up on Pardon Me. Plus the little comments Brandon makes in between songs is a nice little touch. I still watch this after having it over a year and find little things that I never noticed before which makes this that much more sweet. The bonus features are splendid as well. If you watched everything this DVD has to offer it would take up about 1/2 of your day probably, there's that much on here. Just a few of the extras that are crammed on here are a couple of jam sessions of various songs, Brandon recording Warning (a lot of this song is a capella), and Incubus showing how funny they really are. The original cut of the Wish You Were Here video is also on this, which is pretty humerous.A few of the best songs on here are Pardon Me, The Warmth, Warning, New Skin, and Nice To Know You. As amazing and funny as the special features are, the standout is really the performance. I can't find any words that would do this show justice. I guess you just have to see it and judge for yourself.",5,the best just got better,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,1450,"['may', 'have', 'already', 'read', 'was', 'very', 'intimate', 'little', 'show', 'made', 'promote', 'Morning', 'View', 'live', 'footage', 'as', 'good', 'sound', 'flawless', 'boot', 'DVD', 'really', 'good', 'idea', 'how', 'amazing', 'Incubus', 'live', 'Most', 'songs', 'sound', 'was', 'band', 'merely', 'pretending', 'play', 'studio', 'version', 'speakers', 'Every', 'song', 'favorite', 'mine', 'absolutely', 'love', 'way', 'Brandon', 'mixed', 'things', 'up', 'Pardon', 'Me', 'little', 'comments', 'Brandon', 'songs', 'nice', 'little', 'touch', 'still', 'watch', 'having', 'year', 'find', 'little', 'things', 'never', 'noticed', 'much', 'more', 'sweet', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'splendid', 'well', 'watched', 'everything', 'DVD', 'offer', 'would', 'take', 'up', 'about', '1/2', 'day', 'probably', 'much', 'here', 'Just', 'few', 'extras', 'are', 'crammed', 'here', 'are', 'couple', 'jam', 'sessions', 'various', 'songs', 'Brandon', 'recording', 'Warning', 'lot', 'song', 'capella', 'Incubus', 'showing', 'how', 'funny', 'really', 'are', 'original', 'cut', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'video', 'also', 'pretty', 'humerous.A', 'few', 'best', 'songs', 'here', 'are', 'Pardon', 'Me', 'Warmth', 'Warning', 'New', 'Skin', 'Nice', 'Know', 'amazing', 'funny', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'standout', 'really', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'words', 'would', 'do', 'show', 'justice', 'guess', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'judge']",Incubus - The Morning View Sessions

Alvi,"[0, 0]","This performance is really something special, and was surely a very memorable experience for the audience.The venue is small, cozy, and intimate.  The band members face each other, arrayed roughly in a circle, so that they can really communicate and synergize.  The audience surrounds the band on nearly all sides, as though it's hugging the band.  And the ambience has a soothing aura, with simple warm lighting and a scattering of lava lamps and assorted other homey trinkets.Most importantly, the band flawlessly delivers awesome music, which ranges across the full spectrum from rock which will blow your hair back to ballads which are tender and beautiful.  And to top it off, the sound quality of this DVD is superb.  In fact, I'll even dare to suggest that the band's performance and the sound quality of the DVD may surpass their corresponding album versions.Simply put, this DVD captures a truly magical and transcendent moment, and is not to be missed by Incubus fans, especially the Incubus of this vintage (2002).",5,Absolutely sublime,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,1025,"['performance', 'really', 'something', 'special', 'was', 'surely', 'very', 'memorable', 'experience', 'audience.The', 'venue', 'small', 'cozy', 'intimate', 'band', 'members', 'face', 'other', 'arrayed', 'roughly', 'circle', 'can', 'really', 'communicate', 'synergize', 'audience', 'band', 'nearly', 'sides', 'hugging', 'band', 'ambience', 'soothing', 'aura', 'simple', 'warm', 'lighting', 'scattering', 'lava', 'lamps', 'assorted', 'other', 'homey', 'trinkets.Most', 'importantly', 'band', 'flawlessly', 'awesome', 'music', 'full', 'spectrum', 'rock', 'will', 'blow', 'hair', 'back', 'ballads', 'are', 'tender', 'beautiful', 'top', 'off', 'sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'superb', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'even', 'dare', 'suggest', 'band', 'performance', 'sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'may', 'surpass', 'corresponding', 'album', 'versions.Simply', 'put', 'DVD', 'truly', 'magical', 'transcendent', 'moment', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Incubus', 'fans', 'especially', 'Incubus', 'vintage', '2002']",Incubus - The Morning View Sessions

702729,A18TVWGTCYJMV6,B000067IX3,R. Cash,"[25, 25]","In the area of overall quality, this dvd is much better than ""When Incubus Attacks Vol. 2""  The footage is much better, the performance is the best recorded live performance that I've ever seen, and all of the extras are a nice touch to the dvd.  The performance takes place on a really neat round stage in front of a very small audience, the band is set up as if it were a jam session in a studio, and they play like they don't have to convince anyone of anything.  They play alot of their songs from all of their cds except from ""Fungus Amungus.""  Such songs as Pardon Me, Stellar, New Skin, Mexico, The Warmth, Nice To Know You, and about six or seven other songs are included on the dvd.  The dvd also has footage of the band's house on Morning View in California.  Then as an added bonus the original ""Wish You Were Here"" video is included on the dvd as well as the making of the video too.  There isn't as much footage or as many music videos on this dvd as there were on ""When Incubus Attacks Vol. 2,"" but this dvd is put together so much better, and has a lot cleaner look to it.  I recommend this dvd to anybody who is interested in seeing what the band is really like, and this dvd is definately a must buy for any die hard incubus fan out there.",5,"Great Footage, and One Really Good Performance",1023235200,"06 5, 2002",2002,1256,"['area', 'overall', 'quality', 'dvd', 'much', 'better', 'When', 'Incubus', 'Attacks', 'Vol', '2', 'footage', 'much', 'better', 'performance', 'best', 'recorded', 'live', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'extras', 'are', 'nice', 'touch', 'dvd', 'performance', 'place', 'really', 'neat', 'round', 'stage', 'front', 'very', 'small', 'audience', 'band', 'set', 'up', 'were', 'jam', 'session', 'studio', 'play', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'convince', 'anyone', 'anything', 'play', 'alot', 'songs', 'cds', 'Fungus', 'Amungus', 'Such', 'songs', 'Pardon', 'Me', 'Stellar', 'New', 'Skin', 'Mexico', 'Warmth', 'Nice', 'Know', 'six', 'seven', 'other', 'songs', 'are', 'included', 'dvd', 'dvd', 'also', 'footage', 'band', 'house', 'Morning', 'View', 'California', 'Then', 'added', 'bonus', 'original', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'video', 'included', 'dvd', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'video', 'too', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'footage', 'many', 'music', 'videos', 'dvd', 'were', 'When', 'Incubus', 'Attacks', 'Vol', '2', 'dvd', 'put', 'together', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'lot', 'cleaner', 'look', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'anybody', 'who', 'interested', 'seeing', 'what', 'band', 'really', 'like', 'dvd', 'definately', 'must', 'buy', 'die', 'hard', 'incubus', 'fan', 'there']",Incubus - The Morning View Sessions

Don't let the name of this DVD fool you... it's not a ""making of the album"" feature. This is an actual 12-song set at a very small venue. The intimate setting is much more pleasing to the camera eye - as you feel you're practically on stage as Brandon sings, Mike Enziger plays guitar, and the rest of Incubus plays along effortlessly. Incubus makes it look so incredibly easy - these kids are California professionals in my book - masters at their craft. Picture quality is superb, camera angles are great and they change at just the right pace (those who have recently seen Kiss's Melbourne Symphony DVD know what I'm talking about in regards to the acute headaches and nausea encountered due to the high frame rate change every 2 seconds). This DVD features 12 songs - taken from their 3 previous releases (prior to 2002), ""Morning View"", ""Make Yourself"" and ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E."". There are two acoustic songs featuring Brandon & Mike on stage along (performing the songs ""Mexico"" and ""Drive"") that are simply wonderful. There is some additional footage of some of the behind-the-scenes recording of ""The Morning View"" album from a Malibu mansion, as well as the video ""Wish You Were Here"" (and the making-of the video). This is a great way to kill an hour or so.
