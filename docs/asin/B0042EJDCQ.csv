I had to watch this movie in the living room where everyone walked through and I would turn the channel every single time someone would come through hoping they would see I was watching this movie in fear they might think I was gay. Watching this movie changed my life as a gay male. I am now 19 years old and still watch this movie very often. After coming out I made both my parens watch this and I believe that every parent of straight or gay children should sit down and watch this. This movie is not just about a gay teen who commits suicide.This movie starts with a mom who is extremely religious and swears by the bible and when she finds out that her son is gay all she can do is try to fix him. Once he dies she finds out she was much more than wrong. This movie will teach anyone who is willing that being gay is NOT and option for anyone and that criticizing them and telling them it is ""wrong"" is going to do nothing but push them into a darkness that overtakes them. I personally can testify that this movie is a big part of me coming out and it has helped with me being more accepting of who I am as a gay male and I am so thankful that Bobby's story was told.I beg anyone to watch this movie whether they think being gay is wrong or if you accept it, it is a story that needs to be heard by everyone. It will shed light on the topic of gay suicide and will greatly help decrease the rate of gay suicide due to people knowing how to treat someone who is coming out of the closet or is already out.

Sigourney Weaver (already one of my favorite actors), gives a Bravura performance as Bobby's mother; after seeing the movie, it is actually difficult to imagine anyone else in this role. Ryan Kelly is outstanding also as the tormented and doomed Bobby. But more than just a great and heartfelt performance, the viewer can readily imagine that she and the other members of the cast know that they are likely contributing to a work of film art that will inevitably save young lives. How many young people will see this film, read the book of the same name, and have their lives changed or even saved, is unknowable, but that very many will is beyond dispute. Even though the events depicted in this film took place in the 1980's, it is still (sadly) 100% relevant and timely today. One can only hope that in another few years ahead, this story and movie will become but an historical footnote and a window to an age of ignorance and bigotry that will be fading into our past, much as the worst of the racial discrimination of the twentieth century is now doing.Certainly, ""Prayers for Bobby"" will have had a significant role in changing hearts and opening minds against the destructive power of misguided religious fervor and certitude. Every young person of high school and college age, regardless of sexual orientation, should see this film and take its message to heart. It is far more than just a great film.

Parents can be so umbilical and self-centered at times.That's hard because at school and in all events where young people and teenagers meet to have fun, receive an education or practice a sport of any type, there will always be a few bullies who will bash you because deep in their heart they are so afraid of not being normal that they have to bash those they feel are different, and the vast majority around these few, including the police too often, do not say anything, do not move one single little finger, you know the pinky, and we have two, to defend the bullied one, to stop the bully, to prevent that kind of violence, oral, verbal or physical violence.That's hard when the organizations and the ideologies, the religions and the philosophies you try to believe in reject you without any appeal, without any second thought, without any pity, compassion, empathy. True we do not need pity, but that's the minimum these pitiless people should get to not to become pitiful and pathetic. Compassion is already better and yet there is some kind of a consideration that your lot is a suffering of some kind, something that makes you suffer and we just want to share that suffering. That is better than nothing but not enough. You have to get to and give empathy to gays and lesbians just as much as to anyone on earth. Empathy is sharing your mental experience with others and sharing others' mental experiences deep down into your own mind and heart.And that's the road Mary Griffiths, the mother who was only able to quote the wrong verses of the Bible and to interpret them in the wrong way inherited from some old times, when homosexuals where fried on a grill or deep fried in oil on the public place in some kind of festive event, and to finally declare ""I will not have a gay son!"" and when Bobby said "" You must have me the way I am or not at all."" She answered ""Then I don't have a son."" How frighteningly horrible for a mother supported, encouraged, manipulated by her society, her church, the media, her political parties, her whatever organizations you may think of, to say to her own son, her own blood and flesh.The shock of the loss of her son in such a frightening way, run over by an eight-wheeler, with maybe even more than eight wheels, in order not to survive the instant when his suffering brought by the denunciation by his own family, the rejection by his own mother came back to the surface in a strange city, in the dark night, away from home, family and childhood friends, brothers and sisters, with no one to share this fright with.The film is extremely well done and effective because we see the dramatic and even tragic lot of the young man, of Bobby, and at the same time the slow conversion of the mother as a defender of the rights that had been negated by society, and by herself, to her own son. To cure bigotry is a lot more difficult and hard than to cure or simply survive through cancer, AIDS, or a heart attack. It takes time, patience and conviction in the mind of those who are infected by that mental disease. But there is no other way to do it.Let's all of us bless the child, all children, with pure empathy and understanding, support and pride, gay pride maybe but self-pride anyway.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,It takes a mother to repair a mother's mistkakes,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,3969,"['One', 'essential', 'true', 'story', 'last', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'one', 'concerning', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'society', 'name', 'kinds', 'abominations', 'Bobby', 'Griffiths', 'rejected', 'forced', 'leave', 'own', 'community', 'family', 'first', 'mother', 'left', 'tried', 'live', 'life', 'gay', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'love', 'more', 'been', 'hated', 'rejected', 'hard', 'Hate', 'poison', 'antidote', 'not', 'been', 'discovered', 'yet', 'least', 'not', 'quite', 'many', 'people', 'yet', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'allergic', 'cure', 'hard', 'indeed.That', 'hard', 'when', 'own', 'parents', 'had', 'not', 'felt', 'difference', 'had', 'not', 'encouraged', 'be', 'want', 'be', 'least', 'Parents', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'umbilical', 'self-centered', 'times.That', 'hard', 'school', 'events', 'where', 'young', 'people', 'teenagers', 'meet', 'have', 'fun', 'receive', 'education', 'practice', 'sport', 'type', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'few', 'bullies', 'who', 'will', 'bash', 'deep', 'heart', 'are', 'so', 'afraid', 'not', 'being', 'normal', 'have', 'bash', 'feel', 'are', 'different', 'vast', 'majority', 'few', 'including', 'police', 'too', 'often', 'do', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'do', 'not', 'move', 'one', 'single', 'little', 'finger', 'know', 'pinky', 'have', 'two', 'defend', 'bullied', 'one', 'stop', 'bully', 'prevent', 'kind', 'violence', 'oral', 'verbal', 'physical', 'violence.That', 'hard', 'when', 'organizations', 'ideologies', 'religions', 'philosophies', 'try', 'believe', 'reject', 'appeal', 'second', 'thought', 'pity', 'compassion', 'empathy', 'True', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'pity', 'minimum', 'pitiless', 'people', 'should', 'get', 'not', 'become', 'pitiful', 'pathetic', 'Compassion', 'already', 'better', 'yet', 'kind', 'consideration', 'lot', 'suffering', 'kind', 'something', 'suffer', 'just', 'want', 'share', 'suffering', 'better', 'nothing', 'not', 'enough', 'have', 'get', 'give', 'empathy', 'gays', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'earth', 'Empathy', 'sharing', 'mental', 'experience', 'others', 'sharing', 'others', 'mental', 'experiences', 'deep', 'down', 'own', 'mind', 'heart.And', 'road', 'Mary', 'Griffiths', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'able', 'quote', 'wrong', 'verses', 'Bible', 'interpret', 'wrong', 'way', 'inherited', 'old', 'times', 'when', 'homosexuals', 'where', 'fried', 'grill', 'deep', 'fried', 'oil', 'public', 'place', 'kind', 'festive', 'event', 'finally', 'declare', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'gay', 'son', 'when', 'Bobby', 'said', 'must', 'have', 'way', 'am', 'not', 'answered', 'Then', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'son', 'How', 'frighteningly', 'horrible', 'mother', 'supported', 'encouraged', 'manipulated', 'society', 'church', 'media', 'political', 'parties', 'organizations', 'may', 'think', 'say', 'own', 'son', 'own', 'blood', 'flesh.The', 'shock', 'loss', 'son', 'such', 'frightening', 'way', 'run', 'over', 'eight-wheeler', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'eight', 'wheels', 'order', 'not', 'survive', 'instant', 'when', 'suffering', 'brought', 'denunciation', 'own', 'family', 'rejection', 'own', 'mother', 'came', 'back', 'surface', 'strange', 'city', 'dark', 'night', 'away', 'home', 'family', 'childhood', 'friends', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'one', 'share', 'fright', 'with.The', 'film', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'effective', 'see', 'dramatic', 'even', 'tragic', 'lot', 'young', 'man', 'Bobby', 'same', 'time', 'slow', 'conversion', 'mother', 'defender', 'rights', 'had', 'been', 'negated', 'society', 'own', 'son', 'cure', 'bigotry', 'lot', 'more', 'difficult', 'hard', 'cure', 'simply', 'survive', 'cancer', 'AIDS', 'heart', 'attack', 'time', 'patience', 'conviction', 'mind', 'who', 'are', 'infected', 'mental', 'disease', 'other', 'way', 'do', 'it.Let', 'bless', 'child', 'children', 'pure', 'empathy', 'understanding', 'support', 'pride', 'gay', 'pride', 'maybe', 'self-pride', 'anyway.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

I sometimes think there is a tendency to see past the shortcomings of a film if the message is powerful enough. But I'm a firm believer that a film can be both well intentioned and great. ""Prayers for Bobby"" had the potential to be remarkable. I was familiar with the devastating, yet ultimately hopeful, true life case on which it is based and felt the movie could be incredibly powerful and vitally important. When Sigourney Weaver was cast in the lead, I was all the way in. ""Prayers for Bobby,"" for all the positive and/or negative connotations it might imply however, is a Lifetime network made-for-TV movie. At its worst, it shares the shortcuts that many TV biographies employ. At best, it manages to convey a depth beyond traditional TV fare. While not a perfect film, it has definite moments of heavy-handedness, it is a worthwhile one. And, in a coup for Lifetime, it managed to snag Emmy nominations for best film and best actress.""Prayers for Bobby"" tells the story of Mary Griffith, who late in life became an activist for tolerance and equal rights. Her path, however, was an unfortunate one. Devoutly religious, Mary was confronted with a question of faith when her beloved son Bobby (Ryan Kelley) admitted he was homosexual. This was in the early eighties, and Mary's religious education convinced her that the church could cure her son. Feeling guilt and remorse for causing his mother pain and dealing with his true nature as if it were a sin, Bobby battled self loathing and depression. Even having moved away and starting a new life, he couldn't escape his inner demons. When tragedy struck, Mary eventually had to face her own feelings of culpability and reevaluate everything she had been taught to believe.Even though this story takes place about 30 years ago, it has remarkable topicality today. With instances of bullying and resultant teen suicide being a primary focus in the media the past several years, maybe we haven't come as far as we think! ""Prayers for Bobby"" tackles a big issue: how certain religions fail to accommodate all and the devastating effects this intolerance can have on innocent people. Weaver handles the religious fervor well--she is maddening and frustrating, but quite believable. Her change of philosophy, coming too late, is a bit abrupt but heartfelt. She's great (as is Kelley) and it's impossible not to be moved by her final speech. It's the best, most poignant moment in the film and a scene everyone should see (keep a kleenex handy). While sometimes ""Bobby"" is a bit by-the-numbers due to the script, the good points far outweigh any negatives. A moving and emotional experience.

Only after losing her son did she realize it was not HIM that was errant, but HER! Mr. Czerny did not play Mr. Griffith, Bobby-the title character's father-as an emotional man, nor did he seem the dominant of the 2 parents.This was somehow unsettling to me, but alas, perhaps this was how the real-life Mr. Griffith was. The characters in the immediate Griffith family did very well in their respective roles,and Dan Butler whom I am a fan of since ""Frazier"" days was a casting coup.However it was Ms. Weaver who portrayed Mrs. Griffith so humanly that still effects me to this day.It took me 2 years to muster up enough emotional strength to watch it again on LMN(Lifetime Movie Network).This teleplay deserves a look-see from anyone who has had a struggle to be who they are, also the parents who claim ""God will redeem you"" to their children who are not conforming to their (parents) idea of who they should be.

I have not read the book, but the movie adaptation was excellent in my opinion. It tells the story of Bobby Griffith, a young man struggling to balance his sexuality with the religion that he was brought up with. His family isn't accepting of his ""sin,"" and it shows how much it affected the character based on a real-life story. Although in some ways the ending isn't your typical happy one, it is indeed happy in other ways. Bobby's mother questions her faith and becomes a leader for youth GLBT rights after the tragic suicide of her son. The film really hit it home with me because I could see myself in Bobby's shoes. My parents are religious, as am I, and I am struggling to maintain a proper balance of both my religion and sexuality.

It was such an emotional journey, and yet inspiring story that forever touched my soul. Below is the review I wrote almost ten years ago on the book (here on amazon) with some changes based on me viewing the movie and since coming out. I am very thankful for this beautiful book and movie which helped me come to terms with my own sexuality. I hope it inspires, changes and even saves lives like it did mine.This book PRAYERS FOR BOBBY is about a a young adult named Bobby Griffith who was an all american guy, but who also happened to be gay, and his mother who has to come to terms with the suicide of her gay son. In this book you see how Bobby faced with the pressure of his family and his religion telling him it is wrong to be gay. You will also read many bone chilling excerpts of Bobbys most personal thoughts straight out of his journal, which shows how much Bobby had been going through from the fight with his religious beliefs to selling himself on the streets as a SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE. There seems like no other answer and soon the pressure is to much to take and Bobby decides to take his own life. Bobbys mom Mary Griffith who was fearful of her sons sexuality and who was a churchgoer used to pray her son would be healed from this sickness, but once her son dies she decided to transform her life by being a national crusador for gay and lesbian youth. This book realy touched my heart and soul because when I was 10 I lost my uncle who was 20 to suicide. We were very close my uncle was not gay as far as we knew, but suicide became something I had no choice but to learn at an early age. This book was a life changing book for me as it made me confront many of my own issues I had to face growing up as a teen. I always knew I was different and this book along with Madonna gave me the courage to finally come out in my mid twenties. PRAYERS FOR BOBBY is one of those books that inspire you to be better and to not judge others by there sexual preferences. I say if you have not read this book you really need to. This book is sad, but yet one of the most inspirational true stories I have ever read. This is about real life and real life does not always have the storybook happy ending, but will inspire so many people.Sigourney Weaver gave an outstanding performance as her portrayal of Mary Griffith, and Ryan Kelley also gave an amazing performance as Bobby. The movie is very emotional and hard to hold back the tears, but by the end of the movie you see how inspiring and life changing Bobbies death had on his mother.

It also shows that parents need to listen and be accepting because otherwise they might have to live with guilt that nobody should have to feel.I honestly feel Bobby would be incredibly proud of his mother, and I feel we all need to learn from her journey.The five in my family HIGHLY recommend this beautiful and touching movie.",5,A Must-See!,1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,976,"['family', 'watched', 'movie', 'not', 'knowing', 'much', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'learned', 'took', 'place', 'Walnut', 'Creek', 'grew', 'up', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'true', 'story', 'actually', 'happened.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'incredible', 'story', 'such', 'important', 'one', 'just', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'high', 'schools', 'am', 'realistic', 'know', 'fuss', 'would', 'cause', 'just', 'admire', 'journey', 'Bobby', 'mom', 'took', 'movie', 'issues', 'keep', 'people', 'wrongly', 'judging', 'homosexuals', 'religious', 'aspect', 'how', 'was', 'handled.The', 'message', 'movie', 'one', 'love', 'acceptance', 'also', 'parents', 'need', 'listen', 'be', 'accepting', 'otherwise', 'might', 'have', 'live', 'guilt', 'nobody', 'should', 'have', 'feel.I', 'honestly', 'feel', 'Bobby', 'would', 'be', 'incredibly', 'proud', 'mother', 'feel', 'need', 'learn', 'journey.The', 'five', 'family', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'movie']",N/A

However, it does retain the conflict between mother and son, between the son and the pressures and guilt that overcome him, and how the family becomes ardent supporters of PFLAG later.
