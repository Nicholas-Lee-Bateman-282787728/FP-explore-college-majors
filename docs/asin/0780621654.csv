Which was the point I guess. The film opens with a vicious argument and a strange, repeated image that unsettles. If you were expecting something else, you have to adjust.I adjusted better the second time through and enjoyed it much more, hence this edited review. There are plenty of good jokes (like the out of focus actor, played surprisingly subtly by Robin Williams) and set pieces. The scene when Harry visits his sister is particularly funny - classic Woody Allen.On the whole, I felt the film was treading old ground perhaps a little more than usual. I don't think of it as one of my favourite Woody Allen films, but it does stand repeated viewing.",4,"Unsettling at first, but ultimately enjoyable",930528000,"06 28, 1999",1999,796,"['was', ""n't"", 'very', 'receptive', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'was', 'distracted', 'foul-mouthed', 'Allen', 'character', 'made', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'was', 'point', 'guess', 'film', 'vicious', 'argument', 'strange', 'repeated', 'image', 'were', 'expecting', 'something', 'else', 'have', 'adjust.I', 'adjusted', 'better', 'second', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'more', 'hence', 'edited', 'review', 'are', 'plenty', 'good', 'jokes', 'out', 'focus', 'actor', 'played', 'surprisingly', 'subtly', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'set', 'pieces', 'scene', 'when', 'Harry', 'sister', 'particularly', 'funny', 'classic', 'Woody', 'Allen.On', 'whole', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'treading', 'old', 'ground', 'perhaps', 'little', 'more', 'usual', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'favourite', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'stand', 'repeated', 'viewing']",N/A

This film is about coping with reality by creating fanatasies and the relationship of an artist's life to his art and his art to his life. It's also about the problems Allen's character has dealing with others, problems that he creates. I think Allen accomplished all of these things brilliantly and gives us a picture of an immature artist that other's can relate to. Though the character may not be likable at all, all of us can understand at least a little of what he does.This is one of Woody's films heavily influenced by Bergman, specifically his ""Wild Strawberries"". It also reminded me alot of Fellini's ""8 1/2"". Allen uses the device of allowing us to see what the character is thinking through his daydreams and his rembrances, like Fellini and Bergman did. Allen also let's us see how Harry imagined the fiction he wrote, fiction which was based upon his own life.  And like Fellini Allen's character interacts with the characters he created in his mind. At the end of 8 1/2 there is a dance of life, where all the characters from the main character's fantasies, rembrances, and real life are all dancing around the completed movie set, celebrating life. At the end of Deconstructing Harry there is a celebration of neurosis where Harry accepts his award in front of his imagined characters and some people from his real life. While Fellini and Bergman may have celebrated life and death respectively, Allen celebrates neurosis.I don't think I've adequately explained what makes this movie great. I think you would have to see Wild Strawberries and 8 1/2 and then this movie to truly understand. I think this film spoke to me so much because I am also a writer, I don't know if a non-artist would respond to it the same way. But I know that this is a film masterpiece and I hope that it's not the last one Woody has for us.",5,Another Masterpiece from Allen.,1023580800,"06 9, 2002",2002,1925,"['thought', 'was', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'people', 'why', 'think', 'film', 'coping', 'reality', 'creating', 'fanatasies', 'relationship', 'artist', 'life', 'art', 'art', 'life', 'also', 'problems', 'Allen', 'character', 'dealing', 'others', 'problems', 'think', 'Allen', 'accomplished', 'things', 'brilliantly', 'picture', 'immature', 'artist', 'other', 'can', 'relate', 'character', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'likable', 'can', 'understand', 'least', 'little', 'what', 'one', 'Woody', 'films', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'Bergman', 'specifically', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'also', 'reminded', 'alot', 'Fellini', '8', '1/2', 'Allen', 'device', 'allowing', 'see', 'what', 'character', 'thinking', 'daydreams', 'rembrances', 'Fellini', 'Bergman', 'did', 'Allen', 'also', 'let', 'see', 'how', 'Harry', 'imagined', 'fiction', 'wrote', 'fiction', 'was', 'based', 'own', 'life', 'Fellini', 'Allen', 'character', 'characters', 'created', 'mind', 'end', '8', '1/2', 'dance', 'life', 'where', 'characters', 'main', 'character', 'fantasies', 'rembrances', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'dancing', 'completed', 'movie', 'set', 'celebrating', 'life', 'end', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'celebration', 'neurosis', 'where', 'Harry', 'award', 'front', 'imagined', 'characters', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'Fellini', 'Bergman', 'may', 'have', 'celebrated', 'life', 'death', 'respectively', 'Allen', 'neurosis.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'adequately', 'explained', 'what', 'movie', 'great', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'see', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', '8', '1/2', 'then', 'movie', 'truly', 'understand', 'think', 'film', 'spoke', 'so', 'much', 'am', 'also', 'writer', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'non-artist', 'would', 'respond', 'same', 'way', 'know', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'hope', 'not', 'last', 'one', 'Woody']",N/A
30537,A20LY8E9NGYA4M,0780621654,Alejandro Cortes,"[4, 11]","This movie has most of Woody Allen's signatures: a lot of characters, complex dialogues filled with sexual references and complaints, a lot of special appearances (Demi Moore, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal), black humor, social satire and paranoia. However, all these elements are too familiar and have been explored repeatedly in Woody Allen's earlier movies. So the question here is: Is that good or bad?, perhaps the answer is BOTH.Some parts of the story are very entertaining and funny, but some of the situations are kinda boring and too familiar to someone who has seen 5 or more Woody Allen's movies. As it's usual in Allen's films, there are a lot of episodes that connect at the end, half of them are interesting and original, and the other half are recycled material from other Allen's movies.One example of an interesting situation is that the characters from Harry's books appear in front of him, giving him advises or criticizing him. In my opinion that's one of the strongest parts of this movie. And one example of a recycled situation is the love triangle between Allen, one of his former wives and her sister. We have seen this in previous Allen's films (&quot;Hannah And Her Sisters&quot;).For a starter in Woody Allen's movies, this should be an entertaining movie and a good start point; for someone familiar with his earlier work, perhaps this will be a minor achievement in his interesting career.",2,&quot;DECONSTRUCTING HARRY&quot; HAS MOST OF WOODY ALLEN'S TRADEMARKS.,1057449600,"07 6, 2003",2003,1420,"['movie', 'most', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'signatures', 'lot', 'characters', 'complex', 'dialogues', 'filled', 'sexual', 'references', 'complaints', 'lot', 'special', 'appearances', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'black', 'humor', 'social', 'satire', 'paranoia', 'However', 'elements', 'are', 'too', 'familiar', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'repeatedly', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'earlier', 'movies', 'question', 'here', 'good', 'bad', 'perhaps', 'answer', 'BOTH.Some', 'parts', 'story', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'situations', 'are', 'kinda', 'boring', 'too', 'familiar', 'someone', 'who', 'seen', '5', 'more', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'usual', 'Allen', 'films', 'are', 'lot', 'episodes', 'connect', 'end', 'half', 'are', 'interesting', 'original', 'other', 'half', 'are', 'recycled', 'material', 'other', 'Allen', 'movies.One', 'example', 'interesting', 'situation', 'characters', 'Harry', 'books', 'appear', 'front', 'giving', 'criticizing', 'opinion', 'one', 'strongest', 'parts', 'movie', 'one', 'example', 'recycled', 'situation', 'love', 'triangle', 'Allen', 'one', 'former', 'wives', 'sister', 'have', 'seen', 'previous', 'Allen', 'films', 'quot', 'Hannah', 'Her', 'Sisters', 'quot', 'starter', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'good', 'start', 'point', 'someone', 'familiar', 'earlier', 'work', 'perhaps', 'will', 'be', 'minor', 'achievement', 'interesting', 'career']",N/A

30539,AGEIT17HENDIS,0780621654,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 3]","Okay, I will admit that finally after almost a year of watching or re-watching films that the comedic legend Woody Allen wrote, directed, played in or produced I am Woody-ed out. Moreover, there is a reason for that beyond fatigue. As I have pointed out previously in this space if one lives long enough and produces enough work then one is bound to repeat oneself. And that is what has happened to brother Allen here.Allen's premise has been used before as he plays the part of Harry, a writer (what else?) down with a case of writer's block who is also having romantic problems (again, what else?) because the young woman he truly, if belatedly, loves is getting married to a lesser writer. Sound familiar? There are many individually funny moments, mainly by Allen, along the way even if not enough to sustain the film.  Naturally, as is usually the case in an Allen feature in the end things are not qualitatively more resolved than at the beginning. Well that, after all, is life.A nice cinematic touch used here is Harry's (Allen's) sequencing shots to show how autobiographical most novels and short stories really are. Changing the actors in the `real life' story and in the `made up' stories does this well. That part also gets nicely put together at the end.  No so nice here, and a bit unusual for an Allen film, is the extensive use of profanity by Allen and the rest of the cast to show their frustrations with the various antics that Harry is up to and in their own lives. Everything is moreover just a bit too frantic, partly to justify the profanity it would seem. That may tell the tale of why I had a problem with this film, as well.

30540,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780621654,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","Getting to know Woody Allen's filmography as of late has been a real trip, and while there have been some misses for me, for the most part I have become a real fan of his work.  `Deconstructing Harry' may very well be one of my favorites.  The film is an uproarious look at the struggle one makes to create something, about the fact that fiction truly imitates life and that life, in its rawest of forms, is truly remarkable.Woody Allen stars as Harry Block, a famous writer who is suffering from a serious case of writers block.  While he's struggling with this artistic roadblock he is also presented with the honor of being the center of a University tribute, as the school that once threw him out wants to give him an award.  Now, more than ever, Harry is faced with his own slew of insecurities as he contemplates why no one in his life likes him.  As he struggles to find someone to accompany him to his awards ceremony he realizes that the decisions he has made in life has segregated him from those he loves, or at one time loved.  He's been unfaithful to every wife he's ever had and has single-handedly destroyed the reputations of his family, friends and lovers in his novels.  No one can stand him and this forces Harry to reach down inside himself to find the reasons why.The process he uses is what really makes this film so unbelievable good.Telling the story of his life through a series of short stories he in fact wrote, Harry exposes his inner feelings through characters based on himself and others around him.  He explores his romantic relationships and his countless infidelities; his feelings on marriage and loyalty and even success.  He tackles his views on religion and culture and family, all of which help construct (or deconstruct) this man from the inside out.The film is littered with countless supporting actors who just devour the screenplay that Woody delivers to them with such conviction and comedic excellence.  Even actors who have very small roles (Robin Williams) make the most of their limited screen time to deliver performances that elevate the films core.  Billy Crystal and Elizabeth Shue are phenomenal and Demi Moore and Bob Balaban (of Christopher Guest fame) are both scene stealers.  The real standout here, aside from Woody himself, is Kirstie Alley who just dominates as Harry's ex-wife Joan.  She has only a few scenes, and in each scene she is ranting and yelling and throwing a fit, but that fit is seriously comedic genius, rich with honest emotion and brutal delivery.The real star of the show is Woody's brilliant script (which really should have won the Oscar) for it is rich with wit and a truism that makes the film so much more effective than your average comedy.  Harry Block is far from a likable guy, but underneath it all he is an extremely relatable guy, someone who we can see within ourselves.  `Deconstructing Harry' is a smart and successful look at deconstructing ourselves.",5,A wonderfully constructed comedy that helps us deconstruct ourselves...,1222300800,"09 25, 2008",2008,2946,"['Getting', 'know', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'filmography', 'late', 'been', 'real', 'trip', 'have', 'been', 'misses', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'become', 'real', 'fan', 'work', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'favorites', 'film', 'uproarious', 'look', 'struggle', 'one', 'create', 'something', 'fact', 'fiction', 'truly', 'life', 'life', 'rawest', 'forms', 'truly', 'remarkable.Woody', 'Allen', 'stars', 'Harry', 'Block', 'famous', 'writer', 'who', 'suffering', 'serious', 'case', 'writers', 'block', 'struggling', 'artistic', 'roadblock', 'also', 'presented', 'honor', 'being', 'center', 'University', 'tribute', 'school', 'once', 'threw', 'out', 'give', 'award', 'Now', 'more', 'ever', 'Harry', 'faced', 'own', 'slew', 'insecurities', 'why', 'one', 'life', 'find', 'someone', 'accompany', 'awards', 'ceremony', 'decisions', 'made', 'life', 'segregated', 'one', 'time', 'loved', 'been', 'unfaithful', 'wife', 'ever', 'had', 'single-handedly', 'destroyed', 'reputations', 'family', 'friends', 'lovers', 'novels', 'one', 'can', 'stand', 'forces', 'Harry', 'reach', 'down', 'inside', 'find', 'reasons', 'why.The', 'process', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'good.Telling', 'story', 'life', 'series', 'short', 'stories', 'fact', 'wrote', 'Harry', 'inner', 'feelings', 'characters', 'based', 'others', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'countless', 'infidelities', 'feelings', 'marriage', 'loyalty', 'even', 'success', 'views', 'religion', 'culture', 'family', 'help', 'construct', 'deconstruct', 'man', 'inside', 'out.The', 'film', 'littered', 'countless', 'supporting', 'actors', 'who', 'just', 'devour', 'screenplay', 'Woody', 'delivers', 'such', 'conviction', 'comedic', 'excellence', 'Even', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'very', 'small', 'roles', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'make', 'most', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'deliver', 'performances', 'elevate', 'films', 'core', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'fame', 'are', 'scene', 'stealers', 'real', 'standout', 'here', 'aside', 'Woody', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'who', 'just', 'Harry', 'ex-wife', 'Joan', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'scene', 'ranting', 'yelling', 'throwing', 'fit', 'fit', 'seriously', 'comedic', 'genius', 'rich', 'honest', 'emotion', 'brutal', 'delivery.The', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'Woody', 'brilliant', 'script', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'rich', 'wit', 'truism', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'average', 'comedy', 'Harry', 'Block', 'far', 'likable', 'guy', 'extremely', 'relatable', 'guy', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'smart', 'successful', 'look', 'deconstructing']",N/A

While all of Allen's pictures are edgy, occasionally bordering on uncomfortable, ""Harry"" eschews subtlety for in-your-face vulgarity and nonstop profanity.  At the time of the movie's release, Hollywood was still under the spell of the explicit ""Pulp Fiction.""  Suddenly vocal violence was the rage.  Unfortunately most writers didn't (and still don't) have Tarantino's skill for profane poetry.  And Allen, now an old man, is past his prime for hipness--especially relevant commentary about postmodern love.  Rather than trying to recapture his youthful reputation through profanity, Allen should instead begin to write films about aging and the loss of hipness.The plot revolves around Allen, a great writer but a dysfunctional human being.  The main problem is that Allen's character is paper thin.  There is nothing new here--especially for Allen.  He seems to sleepwalk through this part.  In ""Play It Again, Sam"" and ""Annie Hall,"" he was new and fresh, the voice of postmodern love and longing.  Here he is just old.

You hear swearwords, see sex scenes, and you are even taken on a trip down to Hell!Despite these surprises - or perhaps because of them - it works very well. It works brilliantly, in fact. I laughed my way through nearly all of the film.But there is a great deal of philosophy to it as well. The main character Harry (Woody Allen) who is an author is confronted with characters created by himself in his books. And since these characters are a little more than just based on persons from Harry's own life, the border between reality and fantasy becomes pretty wiped out. Very interesting aspect - and extremely elegantly constructed!The meta aspect gets and extra kick as one of Harry's first-person-characters becomes out of focus! A totally genius and hilarious detail! Which ends in the film's key quotation, said by Harry's shrink: You expect the World to adjust to the distortion you've become!The cast is densely occupied by stars even in small roles - Kirstie Alley, Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, Demi Moore and not least GOOORgeous (AND naturally well-acting) Elisabeth Shue.",4,Daring Woody Allen Movie,980294400,"01 24, 2001",2001,1186,"['Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'playing', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'used', 'hear', 'swearwords', 'see', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'even', 'taken', 'trip', 'down', 'Hell', 'surprises', 'perhaps', 'very', 'well', 'brilliantly', 'fact', 'laughed', 'way', 'nearly', 'film.But', 'great', 'deal', 'philosophy', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'character', 'Harry', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'who', 'author', 'confronted', 'characters', 'created', 'books', 'characters', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'just', 'based', 'persons', 'Harry', 'own', 'life', 'border', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'becomes', 'pretty', 'wiped', 'out', 'Very', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'extremely', 'elegantly', 'constructed', 'meta', 'aspect', 'extra', 'kick', 'one', 'Harry', 'first-person-characters', 'focus', 'totally', 'genius', 'hilarious', 'detail', 'Which', 'film', 'key', 'quotation', 'said', 'Harry', 'shrink', 'expect', 'World', 'adjust', 'distortion', ""'ve"", 'become', 'cast', 'densely', 'occupied', 'stars', 'even', 'small', 'roles', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'not', 'least', 'GOOORgeous', 'AND', 'naturally', 'well-acting', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue']",N/A
30546,A20IIR0422G3A5,0780621654,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[32, 34]","`Deconstructing Harry', written and directed by Woody Allen, may set the record for famous name cameos in Allen's pictures, with the added twist that you have famous actors playing the parts of other famous name actors in the same movie, as when, for example, Kirsty Ally, one of the Allen character wives, is played by Demi Moore in a playing out of one of the pieces of fiction represented in the movie.I have often touted the virtue of rewatchability in almost all of Allen's movies. After all, why buy a DVD or tape of a movie if there is no value in watching it more than once. With this movie, it is absolutely essential that you watch it at least three times to understand what is going on, as the movie freely, and with relatively little warning, switches back and forth between cinema reality and Harry's (the Allen character) fiction. In some movies, having trouble keeping track of the plot threads means this is simply a bad movie. There are things in this movie that may have been done poorly, but the parallel thread lines between reality and fiction is not one of them.This is certainly one of Allen's two or three most highly biographical movies, the others being `Stardust Memories' and `Radio Days'. It is not even a big stretch to make the Allen surrogate character a writer rather than a film maker (as in `Stardust Memories') since Allen did a lot of short story writing for the `New Yorker' before film making took all of his time. All of Allen's favorite subjects, primarily love, sex, death, Judaism, parents, and creativity are here. Books have been written about the themes in Allen's movies. `Deconstructing Harry' could easily take a book or at least a long monograph in itself to explicate all the ideas going on in the real and fictional threads.Allen even brings in parodies of classic fiction in his references to both Dante's `Divine Comedy' and Milton's `Paradise Lost'. For good measure, there is a short riff on Bergman's grim reaper character in a reprise from his appearance in `Love and Death'. I will not give Allen too much credit for such an obscure reference, but his visit to Hell (borrowed from Greek mythology) makes Hell seem almost like a fun place to be, even for the damned, if the damned subjects happen to have a yen for a little sweaty bondage. The reference I speak of is to the etched illustrations of Dante's `Inferno' done, I believe by a 19th century artist which provided a lot of guilty pleasures as an adolescent in the grownup library stacks.While this movie is a thoroughly Woody Allen piece, I did get some sense that more than a little influence from Kevin Smith seems to have crept into the dialogue, as the frequency of strong four letter words is dramatically higher than in any other Allen movie. This is improbable, as Smith's first movie, `Clerks' I think just came out shortly before the release of `Deconstructing Harry'. But, the cuss a minute dialogue does remind one of Smith's favorite character, Jay of `Jay and Silent Bob' fame.The quality of the filming and editing in this movie makes one wonder whether some of the sloppy transitions within and between scenes were not intentional. One can easily imagine that the shooting schedule was such that you only had Robin Williams or Richard Benjamin or Demi Moore or Billy Crystal for a day or a half a day, so if you didn't get perfect shots of them on that day, Allen and his editor possibly did the best they could with what they had. There is a kind of choppyness I simply have never seen in any of Allen's movies before or since this one. One thing which makes me think this obviously choppy editing is intentional is the opening scene behind the credits where the Judy Davis character is seen repeatedly leaving her cab at Harry's apartment in order to beat on him for including their marriage in his latest published piece of fiction. The differences in the 5 or 6 times this sequence is shown are almost random, parodying, in a way, the opening to `Manhattan' where the Allen character's voice over is working through various drafts of an opening line to a piece of fiction. So, instead of literally quoting `Manhattan', Allen shows multiple attempts at editing the same scene. Another intentional effect that suggests the choppy editing is intentional is the riff that makes the actor character played by Robin Williams to literally go out of focus.The story is really not quite as neat as the two other biographical movies, even though `Stardust Memories' does contain a lot of ambiguity between the cinematic and the real. It is also clearly not as polished as most of his other movies, especially the high gloss works such as `Crimes and Misdemeanors' and `Hannah and Her Sisters'. In some ways, it has the same manic quality of his very early movies such as `Take the Money and Run' and `Bananas'.And yet, it is easily one of the most interesting about which to spin theories on Allen's sources and his messages. I would only recommend this movie to someone who is fond of Allen's movies already. I would certainly not recommend it to anyone who has never seen or never liked a Woody Allen movie. But, for the faithful, this is pure gold, and funny to boot!",4,The Woodman in the Raw. Great Stuff.

With the same person  writing, directing, acting, and selecting  the music, Woody's films are  definitely &quot;up close and personal.&quot; So, the basic question is do  you like this &quot;double-talking, wise-cracking, pill-popping,  beaver-banging liar&quot; as he is variously termed by the other characters  in this film?Once again we have Woody's obsession with the interaction  between art and reality (see also 'The Purple Rose of Cairo'). The story is  about a writer who cannibalizes his own life and also feeds off those of  the people around him to achieve his success. This mirrors Allen's own  habits of 'narcissistic narrative' that is making films about himself and  constantly recycling his life on screen. We know that it is not Harry Block  who is hypochondriac, psycho-analyzed, sex-obsessed, guilt-ridden and  spiritually bankrupt. It is, of course, Woody himself. The characters he  creates, even the orthodox Jewish psychoanalyst played by Demi Moore, are  merely aspects of himself.Robin Williams plays a character who becomes  blurred so that the people around him have to get glasses to see him  properly. Woody wants people to see things his way, or, even better, use  this misplaced desire itself as artistic fodder.Allen seems  particularly interested in the contradiction that artistic success brings  wealth and fame and therefore desirability, but at the same time feeds on  those closest, on those attracted by the artist's genius. Moths to the  flame! This is explored to its limits as Harry becomes increasingly  isolated. His ex-mistress tries to kill him, his ex-wife (Kirstie Alley)  demonizes him, and even his girlfriend is more interested in Larry (Billy  Crystal) a man who puts his art into his life instead of the other way  round. His low point is reached when he is arrested for kidnapping his own  son. This seems symbolic. Perhaps Woody feels his critics don't want him to  keep using his own life as material!Harry Block/Woody Allen  internalizes his whole life and experience through the characters he  creates, and at the end where they hold a gala for him, they help him reach  a sense of wholeness. This is a complex, multi-layered, yet fast-moving,  and visually stimulating movie. The editing and flights into fantasy keep  boredom well at bay.

30551,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,0780621654,C. Middleton,"[5, 6]","Deconstructing Harry is one of Allen's better films released in the nineties. (1997) Harry Block also is one of the more neurotic characters that Allen has ever created, as a neurotic writer with writer's block is the film's central theme. Harry is alcoholic, pops pills and prefers to have sex with prostitutes because of the acts lack of emotional commitment. Like many writers, he uses the people he knows in reality, their quirks, mannerisms, physical appearance and lives, as models for his fictional characters, which get him into a lot of trouble. But is this really fair to the people one knows, to use them in one's novels, sometimes negatively, to sell one's books?The film is cleverly edited between the writer's life and the fiction he creates, as the audience can see his exaggerations, embellishments and his lack of responsibility to the people he hurts. The film also uses flashbacks in the character's life to show us why he is the way he is now. He uses a theatrical technique used by many great playwrights such as Chekhov and Arthur Miller, putting fictional or dead characters into a dialogue with the central protagonist as a tool of reflection and realization, giving the audience a different perspective of the story.The amount of talent in this film is extraordinary: an older more distinguished looking Richard Benjamin (Catch 22, Goodbye Columbus), Kristie Alley as Joan, Billy Crystal as a friend, Larry, and the charming and understated Devil; Judy Davis (Husbands and Wife's) an excellent if not grating performance as Harry Block's jilted lover; and a young Toby Maguire (Spiderman) portraying a character, Harvey Stern in one of Block's short stories. The list continues from there - Marial Hemmingway, Demi Moore, etc. Some critics commented that he wrote the script to give all the great female actors a job in one of his films as defence against the criticism that he uses the same cast for all his movies. In fact this film is an attack on film and book critics generally. As there depicted as being on the same level as thieves and murderers. The nineties was not a good critical time for Woody Allen films.Harry Block realizes that his real live is lacking due to his failed marriages and numerous affairs - that he can only live a fulfilling life through his art. As he is greeted in a dream by all his characters in his books, hundred's in fact, I was reminded of a story that Charles Dicken had a similar dream at the end of his life, where all the characters (Two thousand) from his many novels come to greet him before he leaves the earth. This purportedly gave the 19th century author meaning to his life during a severe depression. Interestingly the same can be said of Allen's character, Harry Block. Once he comes to terms with his shortcomings, it is his art, his writing that truly gives his life meaning.Although not one of Woody Allen's best film's, it is certainly one of his better one's.",5,One of Allen's better films of the nineties...,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,2941,"['Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'one', 'Allen', 'better', 'films', 'released', 'nineties', '1997', 'Harry', 'Block', 'also', 'one', 'more', 'neurotic', 'characters', 'Allen', 'ever', 'created', 'neurotic', 'writer', 'writer', 'block', 'film', 'central', 'theme', 'Harry', 'alcoholic', 'pops', 'pills', 'prefers', 'have', 'sex', 'prostitutes', 'acts', 'lack', 'emotional', 'commitment', 'many', 'writers', 'people', 'reality', 'quirks', 'mannerisms', 'physical', 'appearance', 'lives', 'models', 'fictional', 'characters', 'get', 'lot', 'trouble', 'really', 'fair', 'people', 'one', 'use', 'one', 'novels', 'sometimes', 'negatively', 'sell', 'one', 'books', 'film', 'cleverly', 'edited', 'writer', 'life', 'fiction', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'exaggerations', 'embellishments', 'lack', 'responsibility', 'people', 'film', 'also', 'flashbacks', 'character', 'life', 'show', 'why', 'way', 'now', 'theatrical', 'technique', 'used', 'many', 'great', 'playwrights', 'such', 'Chekhov', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'putting', 'fictional', 'dead', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'central', 'protagonist', 'tool', 'reflection', 'realization', 'giving', 'audience', 'different', 'perspective', 'story.The', 'amount', 'talent', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'older', 'more', 'distinguished', 'looking', 'Richard', 'Benjamin', 'Catch', '22', 'Goodbye', 'Columbus', 'Kristie', 'Alley', 'Joan', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'friend', 'Larry', 'charming', 'understated', 'Devil', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'Husbands', 'Wife', 'excellent', 'not', 'grating', 'performance', 'Harry', 'Block', 'jilted', 'lover', 'young', 'Toby', 'Maguire', 'Spiderman', 'portraying', 'character', 'Harvey', 'Stern', 'one', 'Block', 'short', 'stories', 'list', 'Marial', 'Hemmingway', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'etc', 'critics', 'commented', 'wrote', 'script', 'give', 'great', 'female', 'actors', 'job', 'one', 'films', 'defence', 'criticism', 'same', 'cast', 'movies', 'fact', 'film', 'attack', 'film', 'book', 'critics', 'generally', 'there', 'depicted', 'being', 'same', 'level', 'thieves', 'murderers', 'nineties', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'critical', 'time', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films.Harry', 'Block', 'real', 'live', 'lacking', 'due', 'failed', 'marriages', 'numerous', 'affairs', 'can', 'only', 'live', 'fulfilling', 'life', 'art', 'greeted', 'dream', 'characters', 'books', 'hundred', 'fact', 'was', 'reminded', 'story', 'Charles', 'Dicken', 'had', 'similar', 'dream', 'end', 'life', 'where', 'characters', 'Two', 'thousand', 'many', 'novels', 'come', 'greet', 'earth', 'purportedly', 'gave', '19th', 'century', 'author', 'meaning', 'life', 'severe', 'depression', 'Interestingly', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Allen', 'character', 'Harry', 'Block', 'Once', 'terms', 'shortcomings', 'art', 'writing', 'truly', 'life', 'not', 'one', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'best', 'film', 'certainly', 'one', 'better', 'one']",N/A

Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[3, 5]","the title ought to tip you off that an approach to viewing this film is required more sophisticated and acute than the usual Hollywood bright mights and mirrors delusions which accompany or popcorn.In fact the first ten minutes of the lucious Louise DReyfuss pleasuring the elder Richard Benjamin are awful in itself, especially as an introduction to this film. Only later does it begin dimly to dawn upon us that these intriguing characters (just what is Dreyfuss's MOTIVATION here?), plus the iconic blind grandmother witness, are merely characters in Woody Allen (Harry)'s commercial rewrite of his life. In fact, we vainly come to miss the presence of some of these characters with concern for their outcome.Once you get a hang of the narrative structure, it's pretty clear what is going on. In fact it is not far from Play it again sam, when fantasy (here formalized in writing) crosses with reality. I find this character of course more pathetic than any earlier character, and more true. THe whole episode of the lost son is especially telling, when one considers Mr. Allen's and his son Satchmo's suffering at the eccentric and vindictive hands of the bizarre and abusive Mia Farrow. And so the reality of Mr. Allen's life crosses the reality of his character Harry's life, which is further crossed by Harry's fantasizing into his writing as a means of making reality more bearable.I really wish nondrinkers would not overestimate their capabilites after chugging various whiskeys.The editing was so jarring it seemed amateurish and I thought my new DVD was choking on my brand new used disk, with several incomprehensible jumps, until I realized that was part of the deconstruction message as well.THere is much to like and to think about here. How could a grown man believe a real out there street whore could hold the secret to peace and happiness and the resolution of our tragedies, and yet so much of us do just that, or they would have no job.But those first few minutes one would not wish to see again.

Johnson,"[3, 4]","Weaving between fiction and reality, Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry tells the tale of a writer's sexual exploits, romantic failings, and dealings with depression. Allen's character Harry transfers his life's problems into his books, which causes much strife between the real-life counterparts in his world.Once again Allen has leveraged his considerable fame to draw in Hollywood's elite. Throughout the film, every face is a familiar one. Billy Crystal is portrayed as the devil who steals Woody's romantic lead, Robin Williams as a blurry actor who can't get his focus, Kirstie Alley as a ex-wife who discovers Harry has cheated with a patient, and countless more celebrity cameos.The joy in partaking in this film is evident in the celebrity actors who appear. There's a certain prestige in such an endeavor, and we, the film audience, can identify just about everyone in the film. At the same time, each character that appears has so much baggage in our minds. For instance, Demi Moore appears as an ex-wife. How many of us can honestly think of her in any way other that her celebrity profile. While this isn't a major problem, identifying with some of the celebrities proves difficult at times.Deconstructing Harry catalogs Woody's struggle with sexual desire and his inability to love. Early on we discover that he has finally found true love in a pupil, Elizabeth Shue, but she has fallen in love with his friend.The plot is shaped around Harry's self-identity questions, and the character's goal is to go to an honorary ceremony at his alum. He has nobody to take. His ex-wife won't let him take his son, his girlfriend has left him, and a hooker is the only one around that will take him up on his need for companionship.The play between Allen's semi-autobiographical stories, which flash to and from reality, illuminate the film and shows how Allen's writing channels his depression and gives him a release from an otherwise ugly life.After viewing Deconstructing Harry, I wonder how autobiographical it really is.",4,Allen's self-exploration vignettes,1023148800,"06 4, 2002",2002,2029,"['Weaving', 'fiction', 'reality', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'tale', 'writer', 'sexual', 'exploits', 'romantic', 'failings', 'dealings', 'depression', 'Allen', 'character', 'Harry', 'life', 'problems', 'books', 'much', 'strife', 'real-life', 'counterparts', 'world.Once', 'again', 'Allen', 'leveraged', 'considerable', 'fame', 'draw', 'Hollywood', 'elite', 'film', 'face', 'familiar', 'one', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'portrayed', 'devil', 'who', 'Woody', 'romantic', 'lead', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'blurry', 'actor', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'focus', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'Harry', 'cheated', 'patient', 'countless', 'more', 'celebrity', 'cameos.The', 'joy', 'partaking', 'film', 'evident', 'celebrity', 'actors', 'who', 'appear', 'certain', 'prestige', 'such', 'endeavor', 'film', 'audience', 'can', 'identify', 'just', 'everyone', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'baggage', 'minds', 'instance', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'ex-wife', 'How', 'many', 'can', 'honestly', 'think', 'way', 'other', 'celebrity', 'profile', ""n't"", 'major', 'problem', 'identifying', 'celebrities', 'difficult', 'times.Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'catalogs', 'Woody', 'struggle', 'sexual', 'desire', 'inability', 'love', 'Early', 'discover', 'finally', 'found', 'true', 'love', 'pupil', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'fallen', 'love', 'friend.The', 'plot', 'shaped', 'Harry', 'self-identity', 'questions', 'character', 'goal', 'go', 'honorary', 'ceremony', 'alum', 'nobody', 'take', 'ex-wife', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'take', 'son', 'girlfriend', 'left', 'hooker', 'only', 'one', 'will', 'take', 'up', 'need', 'companionship.The', 'play', 'Allen', 'semi-autobiographical', 'stories', 'flash', 'reality', 'illuminate', 'film', 'how', 'Allen', 'writing', 'channels', 'depression', 'release', 'otherwise', 'ugly', 'life.After', 'viewing', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'wonder', 'how', 'autobiographical', 'really']",N/A

Davis is at her best, a fulminating monster of rage. Memory and guilt fill the story of this tormented writer who has no sense of loyalty, save that to his art.

Allen plays Harry Block, a famous writer suffering from the writer's block and also from inability to survive in real world, to be happy and to make the people in his life happy, ""Six shrinks later, three wives down the line, and I still can't get my life together"". Harry can't get his life together but he can write and he has put himself and all people he knows including his wives, friends, girl-friends, and his sister into his last novel. His art imitated life so closely that real people recognized themselves in the fictional characters very easily and now Harry lives through the nightmare of confronting near everybody he has ever known as well as the fictional characters, offended, infuriated, and insulted, who all rush in anger to face him: ""You have no values. With you it's all nihilism, cynicism, sarcasm, and orgasm.""By its structure, ""Deconstructing Harry"" reminds the earlier film by one of Allen's favorite directors, Ingmar Bergman, ""Wild Strawberries"". As Professor Borg, Harry Block travels by car to upstate New York, where his college that expelled him as an undergraduate now wants to honor him as a world renowned belletrist. He travels by car with three unlikely companions, a hooker, a friend with bad heart, and his 9-years-old son whom he had kidnapped from school. As in ""Wild Strawberries"", Allen's film provides sincere, intelligent, and emotional contemplations of life's disappointment, regrets, and losses but at the same time, it is hilarious as only Allen's films can be. One of the best scenes of the film is Harry's descent on the elevator to air-conditioned Hell where in the ninth circle he meets the Devil who looks very much like Billy Crystal. Another wonderful scene concerns a married couple where after thirty years of happy uneventful marriage a wife learns some interesting eating habits from her husband's previous life. I can go on for long time. As often in the case of Allen's movies, with the modest running time of 96 minutes, ""Deconstructing Harry"" is expertly shot, boasts an amazing cast (Billy Crystal, Judy Davis, Bob Balaban, Elisabeth Shue, Demi Moore, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tobey Maguire, and Stanley Tucci just to name a few), and is in my opinion one of the most interesting and personal Allen's films.",4,"Harry Block: ""Six shrinks later, three wives down the line, and I still can't get my life together"".",1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,2736,"['Deconstructing', 'Harry', '1997', 'written/directed', 'starred', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', '1996', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'angriest', 'busiest', 'most', 'neurotic', 'most', 'complex', 'most', 'personal', 'funniest', 'one-liners', 'film', 'effortlessly', 'past', 'present', 'reality', 'world', 'imagination', 'funny', 'bits', 'contemplation', 'serious', 'personal', 'subjects', 'so', 'rapidly', 'have', 'watch', 'closely', 'order', 'not', 'get', 'lost', 'worlds', 'Allen', 'Harry', 'Block', 'famous', 'writer', 'suffering', 'writer', 'block', 'also', 'inability', 'survive', 'real', 'world', 'be', 'happy', 'make', 'people', 'life', 'happy', 'Six', 'shrinks', 'later', 'three', 'wives', 'line', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'life', 'together', 'Harry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'life', 'together', 'can', 'write', 'put', 'people', 'including', 'wives', 'friends', 'girl-friends', 'sister', 'last', 'novel', 'art', 'imitated', 'life', 'so', 'closely', 'real', 'people', 'recognized', 'fictional', 'characters', 'very', 'easily', 'now', 'Harry', 'nightmare', 'confronting', 'everybody', 'ever', 'known', 'as', 'well', 'fictional', 'characters', 'offended', 'infuriated', 'insulted', 'who', 'rush', 'anger', 'face', 'have', 'values', 'nihilism', 'cynicism', 'sarcasm', 'orgasm', 'structure', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'earlier', 'film', 'one', 'Allen', 'favorite', 'directors', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'Professor', 'Borg', 'Harry', 'Block', 'travels', 'car', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'college', 'expelled', 'undergraduate', 'now', 'honor', 'world', 'renowned', 'belletrist', 'car', 'three', 'unlikely', 'companions', 'hooker', 'friend', 'bad', 'heart', '9-years-old', 'son', 'whom', 'had', 'kidnapped', 'school', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'Allen', 'film', 'sincere', 'intelligent', 'emotional', 'contemplations', 'life', 'disappointment', 'regrets', 'losses', 'same', 'time', 'hilarious', 'only', 'Allen', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'Harry', 'descent', 'elevator', 'air-conditioned', 'Hell', 'where', 'ninth', 'circle', 'Devil', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'concerns', 'married', 'couple', 'where', 'thirty', 'years', 'happy', 'uneventful', 'marriage', 'wife', 'interesting', 'eating', 'habits', 'husband', 'previous', 'life', 'can', 'go', 'long', 'time', 'often', 'case', 'Allen', 'movies', 'modest', 'running', 'time', '96', 'minutes', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'expertly', 'shot', 'amazing', 'cast', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'opinion', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'personal', 'Allen', 'films']",N/A

Now it seems that critics and--to some extent--audiences accord Allen a certain respect for his wit and intelligence, but no one seems to get excited over the prospect of a new Woody film anymore.I suspect, in  part, it's because he's been almost too prolific over the past decade or so.  Someone below suggested that you either like Woody or you don't.  But it's not that simple: you can genuinely like someone and get a little sick of his routine at the same time.In &quot;Deconstructing Harry,&quot; Allen explores such familiar themes &quot;art vs. life,&quot;  &quot;men vs. women,&quot;  &quot;critical intelligence vs. received wisdom (i.e. tradition).&quot;  He engages yet another talented ensemble cast, all working for peanuts and prestige, and peppers the screenplay with enough sharp dialog to keep the viewer engaged.  But this is no &quot;Annie&quot; or &quot;Hannah.&quot;  The contrast of the &quot;fictional&quot; realities from Harry Block's pen and the &quot;real&quot; scenes (from Woody Allen's pen) seems  more  gimmicky than illuminating.Therein lies the problem.  What was once innovative in Allen's films now seems tired.  Moreover, his characters are no longer likeable schlubs trying to make sense out of life.  They're, for the most part, unlikeable cynics who have given up making the effort.

And yet, it is Allen's second best film in my opinion.  I like characters like this in the movies, who are unsympathetic and yet in-advertantly by being the protagonist you have to feel a little sympathy after a while (how can't you when he reveals Billy Crystal as a Hollywood hating Satan, a common Jewish man turns out to be a murdering cannibal, and that there are signs that goddesses exist at Victoria's Secret?).Here, Harry has writer's block for the first time in his life (his last name is Block as well, pun possibly intended) since everyone he has taken from his real life and ""thinly disguised"" isn't around to give him any ideas (outside of the Crystal thing).  The bulk of the film holds flashbacks, in brilliantly edited fashion, where he recollects his old stories, the alter egos of his real life wives and relatives and so on.If Woody had made this movie as a deep and serious self-reflection of his demons, it would be interesting but it wouldn't be funny.  Here, he reminds his old fans that he can bring laugh out loud jokes and gags, most for Jewish people, to be sure, but all around ones as well, and the moment you realize it's a comedy/drama and not a vulgar piece of cinema that was thrown from Woody's chair as a backlash to the critics, you'll have fun.

30566,A1JF8PSY0NPSYY,0780621654,Jeffery K. Matheus,"[8, 8]","How can I best describe the story of Woody Allen's 1997 comedy &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot;? Well, I think that the film does a great job of describing itself with some of the final words of dialogue that we hear spoken by Allen's on-screen protaganist Harry Block, &quot;It's about a really interesting character, a guy who can't function well in life, but can only function in art&quot;. This is not the first or last time that Allen has taken on the subject of creative personalities in his work, look at the jazz musician in &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot;, the playwright in &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot;, or the documentary fimmaker in &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;. But with &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; Allen seems to be at both his most self-revealing AND self-conscience as he tackles the life of a popular (but unhappy) novelist who is experiencing writers block, as well as those close to him who he has literally &quot;used&quot; in his work. It also seems like Allen was in a particularly dark and pessimistic mood when he concieved this piece (as opposed to say, the romanticism of &quot;Manhattan&quot; or &quot;Annie Hall&quot;), but luckily for us that pessimism translates into some hilarious darkly-comic moments. I must say that personally, I love this film and consider it among Allen's best work ever,...but I gaurantee you, it will NOT be for everybody! This film has an unusally complex style of storytelling, even by Woody Allen standards. We see Harry's life and work unfold through flashbacks, scenes from his novels, fantasy sequences, and most interestingly, conversations with the imaginary characters that he has created. Some viewers may also be turned-off by Woody's excessive use of jump-cuts in this film, as dialogue is sometimes cut off in mid-sentence, and scenes jump from one image to another. However, some words spoken by Harry towards the end of the film about his &quot;fragmented, disjointed existence&quot; (as the on-screen picture runs through a series of quick jump cuts), seem to be an attempt by Allen to actually  EXPLAIN the film's choppy style to his viewers. I remember that  when some people went to see this film in the theater (including a certain big-time movie critic!) they got completely swamped by it's unpredicable, free-wheeling narrative, but for those who are used to Allen's unique brand of storytelling will probably find it to be quite fascinating! It would be amiss of me not to mention Allen's excellent supporting cast. Elisabeth Shue (looking particularly gorgeous here!) is a sheer delight as Harry's much-younger love interest, and their brief scenes together add s real spark to the film, Judy Davis has some great scenes as a neurotic kook ex-lover who has been hurt by Harry's all-too-true work, and TV actress Kirstie Alley almost steals the show as Harry's bitter ex-wife, and a flashback to the literal END of their marriage is one of the films best moments. Allen and Alley are both exceptional in what must be the most hilarious marital argument scene ever put on film! Harry's wimpy backpeddling and self-justification when caught in an exra-marital affair is a classic Woody Allen moment! This film may not be for everyone, but for those who &quot;get it&quot;, &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; is a great cinema experience!",5,"Woody Allen travels into the mind of a writer, excellent!",974419200,"11 17, 2000",2000,3327,"['How', 'can', 'best', 'describe', 'story', 'Woody', 'Allen', '1997', 'comedy', 'quot', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'quot', 'Well', 'think', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'describing', 'final', 'words', 'dialogue', 'hear', 'spoken', 'Allen', 'on-screen', 'protaganist', 'Harry', 'Block', 'quot', 'really', 'interesting', 'character', 'guy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'function', 'well', 'life', 'can', 'only', 'function', 'art', 'quot', 'not', 'first', 'last', 'time', 'Allen', 'taken', 'subject', 'creative', 'personalities', 'work', 'look', 'jazz', 'musician', 'quot', 'Sweet', 'Lowdown', 'quot', 'playwright', 'quot', 'Bullets', 'Broadway', 'quot', 'documentary', 'fimmaker', 'quot', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'quot', 'quot', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'quot', 'Allen', 'be', 'most', 'self-revealing', 'AND', 'self-conscience', 'life', 'popular', 'unhappy', 'novelist', 'who', 'experiencing', 'writers', 'block', 'as', 'well', 'close', 'who', 'literally', 'quot', 'used', 'quot', 'work', 'also', 'Allen', 'was', 'particularly', 'dark', 'pessimistic', 'mood', 'when', 'concieved', 'piece', 'opposed', 'say', 'romanticism', 'quot', 'Manhattan', 'quot', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'luckily', 'pessimism', 'hilarious', 'darkly-comic', 'moments', 'must', 'say', 'personally', 'love', 'film', 'consider', 'Allen', 'best', 'work', 'ever', 'gaurantee', 'will', 'NOT', 'be', 'everybody', 'film', 'unusally', 'complex', 'style', 'storytelling', 'even', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'standards', 'see', 'Harry', 'life', 'work', 'unfold', 'flashbacks', 'scenes', 'novels', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'most', 'interestingly', 'conversations', 'imaginary', 'characters', 'created', 'viewers', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'turned-off', 'Woody', 'excessive', 'use', 'jump-cuts', 'film', 'dialogue', 'sometimes', 'cut', 'off', 'mid-sentence', 'scenes', 'jump', 'one', 'image', 'However', 'words', 'spoken', 'Harry', 'end', 'film', 'quot', 'fragmented', 'disjointed', 'existence', 'quot', 'on-screen', 'picture', 'series', 'quick', 'jump', 'cuts', 'seem', 'be', 'attempt', 'Allen', 'actually', 'EXPLAIN', 'film', 'choppy', 'style', 'viewers', 'remember', 'when', 'people', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'theater', 'including', 'certain', 'big-time', 'movie', 'critic', 'got', 'completely', 'swamped', 'unpredicable', 'free-wheeling', 'narrative', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'Allen', 'unique', 'brand', 'storytelling', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'be', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'would', 'be', 'amiss', 'not', 'mention', 'Allen', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'looking', 'particularly', 'gorgeous', 'here', 'sheer', 'delight', 'Harry', 'much-younger', 'love', 'interest', 'brief', 'together', 'add', 's', 'real', 'spark', 'film', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'great', 'scenes', 'neurotic', 'kook', 'ex-lover', 'who', 'been', 'hurt', 'Harry', 'all-too-true', 'work', 'TV', 'actress', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'almost', 'show', 'Harry', 'bitter', 'ex-wife', 'flashback', 'literal', 'END', 'marriage', 'one', 'films', 'best', 'moments', 'Allen', 'Alley', 'are', 'exceptional', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'most', 'hilarious', 'marital', 'argument', 'scene', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'Harry', 'wimpy', 'backpeddling', 'self-justification', 'when', 'caught', 'exra-marital', 'affair', 'classic', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'moment', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'who', 'quot', 'get', 'quot', 'quot', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'quot', 'great', 'cinema', 'experience']",N/A

30570,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,0780621654,kaduzy,"[9, 41]","According to everything I've heard, Woody Allen used to make brilliant movies.  I rented this one because I remembered seeing a trailer for it years ago, and at the time I thought it looked hilarious.  Sadly, upon watching the movie for the thirty or forty minutes I could stand, I found it to be not only lacking in humor (I didn't laugh once) but actually painful to watch.  The first scene in the film features two characters (literally, characters, as we find out later) having loud sex with a blind woman in the next room.  They have to justify the noises they're making and cover up what they're doing, so they wind up fooling the woman into thinking they're making martinis.  This is something I would have expected from one of the ""American Pie"" movies, but not from someone who is supposed to be some kind of a comedic genius.  ""Funny"" lines include clunkers like, ""My God, you're like a Born-Again Christian, except you're Jewish.""  Doesn't Allen have anyone to proof-read his scripts for him, and tell him when something's not even remotely funny????Allen's main character has apparently just written a book that barely fictionalizes his real-life relationships, and no one is very happy about it.  In the second scene, one of the women he wrote about (the one having sex in front of the blind woman) comes to his apartment, delivers a hysterical and very incoherant, and EXTREMELY unbelievable, poorly delivered monologue about how upset she is, then tries to kill him.  The action then cuts to a flashback (or is it another story?) of Allen's character as a young man (played by Tobey Maguire, who I guess just wanted to be able to say he's worked with Allen) sleeping with an Asian hooker and then getting confronted by Death.Yes, Death.  THAT Death.  He must have stopped playing Battleship with Bill and Ted long enough to make a cameo here, because the cheesiness of his appearance is equal to that film, but since Bill and Ted's cheesiness is inherant to the film, it worked for them.  It miserably fails here.The story meanders on from there, featuring Robin Williams as an out-of-focus actor (please don't make me explain that one), Demi Moore as a Jewish (!) shrink (!!) who is attracted to Stanley Tucci (!!!!!!), and that cute kid from The Santa Clause as Allen's child.  The editing is as neurotic as Allen's character, and it keeps jumping back to repeat the same images over and over again, or cutting people off partway through their sentences and starting again on a new sentence.

(Something that's happened to me with a number of Woody Allen films).I recalled it as misogynistic and self serving. While it still has moments of those qualities, it feels like Allen is toughest of all on himself. But is he tough enough? This is certainly the worst, most abrasive and selfish Allen has ever let himself look on screen, but there was still a feeling of pulling his self-aimed punches just a bit. Sort of an ""All That Jazz"" lite.The film has a large number of very funny lines, and creative ideas (Robin Williams as an out-of-focus actor is a brilliant concept), and its fun to see a filmmaker Allen's age pushing his style limits, with jump cuts and multi-layered construction. Still, it starts to repeat its own ideas after a while, both literally and thematically, and the ending feels a bit wimpy.All said, while not Allen's best, its still a dense, funny, inventive, thoughtful film, from a world class film-maker -- something sadly increasingly rare in American cinema.Frustrating and concerning that this film is out-of-print.

Next to ""Mighty Aphrodite"", and ""Manhattan"", this is one of Allen's best.""Deconstructing Harry"" could be looked at as Woody's love letter to himself. It's about a divorced writer, who during the course of the movie looks back on his life and his work in all it's facets and flaws, jokes and groans. He is to recieve an award for his work from a university, and in true Woody Allen style, he brings his son, a [prostitute], and a dead man in the back seat. Upon his arrival he is greeted and celebrated by all the people and characters who shaped his life and his work. FANTASTIC! Allen pulls off a hilarious plot tinged with that classic Allen wit and humor that shines through to our hearts and brains!Packed with a great cast including Robin Williams, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, Tobey McQuire, and Billy Crystal in a cameo as Satan (a role that he is PERFECT in), Allen once again proves that he always can get the right people for the job.You could probably rename this movie ""Woody on Woody"", but that would sound kinda wrong!

30577,A2R6RA8FRBS608,0780621654,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Deconstructing Harry is an underrated film; it's a fine piece of work boasting many humorous moments mixed with genuine poignancy. The plot moves along well; the casting was very well done and includes quite a few cameos by very famous and talented actors; and the choreography reflects great forethought. True, some will question the ""choppy"" look and feel to the film as several scenes appear to be cut and pasted rather haphazardly at first; but after viewing the film more than once it all really looks pretty good! In addition, the musical score enhances the film.So much has been written about the significance of the film, certain scenes and elements of the plot; I am impressed by what other reviewers have noted and I honestly feel that there's little new information I can share in that regard. However, it's worthwhile to summarize the plot and discuss the film.Writer Harry Block (Woody Allen) is suffering from a case of ""writer's block;"" he just can't get a good idea for his next book and he spent the advance on the book already! Harry's past books have made enemies of all his friends once he writes about them; exposes them and ruins their lives because he merely thinly disguises them and their relationships. Harry's own life hasn't gone well either--he's been through three marriages which all ended in divorce; and after six psychiatrists Harry doesn't have a grip on life. He mixes pills with booze; sleeps with prostitutes and lies to people about that and many other things; has affairs when he is married and Harry even has trouble just seeing his son on the day Harry is honored by his old university.Things start to look a little bit brighter when Harry drives up to Adair University to get his award with his friend Richard (Bob Balaban), a prostitute he just met and slept with named Cookie (Hazelle Goodman) and his son Hilly (Eric Lloyd). They stop at Harry's half-sister's house; Doris (Caroline Aaron) and her religious husband Burt (Eric Bogosian) have a great scene with Harry as they debate some pretty heavy issues although with the comedy Woody throws in it's actually enjoyable.There's still much more to the plot; I've already left out quite a bit and rest assured you'll be entertained! Suffice it to say that everything is thoughtfully done and with a certain believability that really appeals to me.Moreover, the film remains meaningful because there are always people who want to look at themselves and try to determine what life means for them; what they should be getting out of life and how they should best achieve their goals. We see Harry Block trying so hard to do this; and with his innate human foibles it's easy to relate to Harry's struggle. And could Harry's last name Block represent that he has ""writer's block?"" It certainly could!Look also Kirstie Alley as Joan; Judy Davis as Lucy; Stephanie Roth Haberle as Janet; Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Leslie; Robin Williams as Mel, an actor; Stanley Tucci as Paul Epstein; Demi Moore as Helen; Julie Kavner as Grace; Tobey Maguire as Harvey Stern and Richard Benjamin as Ken.The DVD comes with the option of viewing the film in either widescreen or full screen; there are cast biographies as well.Deconstructing Harry is a must-have for Woody Allen fans; and fans of the other actors in this film would do well to add this to their collections.

In a jiff, a classic Woody Allen character, but darker, sadder, more isolated and more immature.Now, on the verge of a famous University tribute, Harry must deal with his insecurities, bad habits and nerves while he begins a journey where he will interact with dual realities -the ones in his agitated life and the ones reflected through the characters of his books- and will show the audience with very black humor his incapacity to have honest relationships and his absurd excuses to defend his nasty actions. He will revolve in the deepest caves of his destructive side until literally go to hell, as never had done an Allen's characterTo recommend Deconstructing Harry implies to warn you that you`ll be part of a sordid world of phobias, obsessions, fear of death, hypochondrias and neurosis, all of this wrapped up with a coat of vulgarity and repulsiveness that won't run out through the 96 minutes of the film.It's a respectable, intelligent, witty and crude work. Here, Allen has consumed himself as an irreverent. Honest and brutal, he gives us a stellar cast with colorful characters, with Harry as the center of everything. The dialogs are quick, witty, full of cynicism, and will get as many laughs as many stomach kicks. But let's appreciate his honesty, not criticize it.It's inevitable not to compare Allen's life and personality with his Harry: his ability to create memorable and valuable works, in spite of the scandals surrounding his life, his personality, a little neurotic and lonely.

JEFFREY MCMAHON ""herculodge""","[2, 5]","An homage to Fellini with dream sequences in which Harry Block's fictional characters from his short stories interwine with his real-life characters, Deconstructing Harry is about a writer who cannibalizes his life experience, using his loved ones and family as fodder for his fiction and who in the process alienates, humiliates, and enrages those people who prefer their secrets not be featured in published fiction. Amongst this turmoil the writer Harry is obsessed with freeing himself from himself--a sixty-year-old man who never grows up but who remains fixated on his childish ego, his raging lusts, and his incurable narcissism.  Divorced several times, barely able to see his young son, and resenting that a lover whom he scorned is now marrying, he must negotiate between the people he has alienated and the fictional characters who merge with reality as he goes on a soul quest to answer the question: Can I ever grow up? I can't reveal the ending but will say that the film maintains a Fellinisque, comic tone that has a hint of magic.

30586,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,0780621654,RMurray847,"[9, 11]","This is the meanest, nastiest, most vicious we've seen Woody Allen. And so much of it is directed towards himself. We certaily all know that Allen's films are very much about himself and his persona, but this one is filled with a heavy dose of self-loathing. It also has very little good to say about anyone else, particularly women. It's just a bit frightening how much vitriol Allen has. His character (a writer instead of a film mater) only seems to like his son and a prostitute.But as the movie progresses, he gets little telling glimpses of the effect he has on others, and how this has helped make him so unhappy. Will he change...doubtful. But at the end, we feel like maybe we've gotten a fairly unsugarcoated look at how Woody Allen really feels about himself, his art and the women in his life.The movie is really, really funny. It's extremely foul-mouthed (do not let kids near it...it makes Mira Sorvino in MIGHTY APHRODITE seem quite tame). You also get to see some familiar actors doing some pretty down and dirty things...Julia Louis Dreyfuss in a rather explicit scene with Richard Benjamin...that alone is an eye-brow raiser. The normally sweet Tobey Maguire is a sex-crazed younger version of Allen...to comic effect. Judy Davis (one of the best actresses anywhere, period) is funny as a pistol-wielding former lover of Allen's, spouting intelligent (and extremely obscene) insults at him, while slowly coming unglued.We see a number of Allen's character's short stories acted out, and those are often amusing little ditties, although the one with the old Jewish couple is just silly. Another one with Robin Williams (as a man who is becoming ""unfocused"") is very amusing.One excellent scene has Allen surprising his sister with a visit while he's on a drive to upstate New York to get an award. She's married to a very conservative Jewish man, and has really turned her life over to a life some might call zealot-like (certainly Allen does). The pain of Allen's and his sister's relationship is palpable...there's real pain on both sides...and real love. Something we don't see often in Allen's glib, cynical world.The cast is unformly great (with one exception...in a moment). Allen, Davis, Dreyfuss, etc. Robin Williams makes a brief, amusing appearance, along with Julie Kavner. Imagine those two married!! Demi Moore, in a tiny part, is tolerable, and Billy Crystal is amusing as the Devil (yep, Allen's character goes to hell towards the end, and the conception of hell is pretty funny and pretty elaborate for a Woody Allen movie).The exception to all the praise is Elizabeth Shue. I'm sorry, but she seemed to have spent all her talent with LEAVING LAS VEGAS. She is simply terrible in this film (and others, like THE HOLLOW MAN & COUSIN BETTE), playing the part of Allen's current love interest. Seeing Allen with all these young beautiful women in movie after movie is always hard...but they usually come across as intelligent and perhaps it is the shared intelligence that Allen and these young beauties have that make their relationships tolerable. Shue, on the other hand, comes across as vacuous. She almost looks like she's reading cue cards. The few scenes she is in totally grind the movie to a halt.But, that flaw aside, see this movie if you like Woody Allen, and frankly, maybe if you don't like him.

Looking at his corpus of work, it is hard to believe that movies like Bananas, Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask), Husbands and Wives and, my favorite, Crimes and Misdemeanors could come from the same person.Deconstructing Harry remains true to the title as the viewer is given a wild postmodern view of a man who wrestles with his own identity amidst the numerous identities he has created around him.  Allen's character is, as is often the case with Allen, startlingly autobiographical, while the character also suffers from the fact that his stories are also insultingly biographical.While Celebrities may surpass this film in vulgarity, Allen comes pretty close in this one, with a level of humour that is almost crude, even with a touch of rare anger.  There is no &quot;simple&quot; adultery here; the character is blatantly sexually obsessed.  It makes for simultaneously hilarious and sobering comedy.At the time of watching the film, I wondered if this was perhaps Allen's last film.

30591,A3P6XT8Y1FEF3,0780621654,Seamus,"[4, 5]","Like a lot of writers, Woody Allen puts a little bit of himself into each of his films.  If you pay attention, it's easy to see that beneath the humor, he usually has something to say that is most likely a reflection of his own beliefs about life, love, religion, or whatever else might be on his mind.  The characters often resemble the writer/director and events often reflect what's going on in his own life.Along that line, ""Deconstructing Harry"" might be Allen's most personal film.  Harry, the main character, is a writer who creates dark, humorous stories.  He typically draws on his own experiences in life, including his relationships with a half-sister, three former wives, and a young mistress.  Of course, most of them aren't happy to find out they've become novels in his latest stories.The movie has a large ensemble cast that includes Allen, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Billy Crystal, Elisabeth Shue, Kirstie Alley, Tobey Maguire, Robin Williams, and Demi Moore.  Some of the actors are playing characters in Harry's life, and others are characters in his stories.  The movie takes a page from ""Wild Strawberries,"" with the author going back to different times in his life as he prepared to be honored.  But instead of flashing back to things that actually happened, the history is often given through the stories that Harry wrote. It's an interesting, novel, and humorous way to put together a film.This is either a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" type film.  Many critics considered it vulgar and profane, but they've really missed the point.  The movie is tasteless at times, but that only helps to illustrate the theme of the film: that Harry is a despicable person in real life, but that doesn't mean he can't be a great artist.  Since this movie was released at a time when Allen was being tried in the media for events in his personal life, the message seems very clear.",5,A Movie With a Message,1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,1876,"['lot', 'writers', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'little', 'bit', 'films', 'pay', 'attention', 'easy', 'see', 'beneath', 'humor', 'usually', 'something', 'say', 'most', 'likely', 'reflection', 'own', 'beliefs', 'life', 'love', 'religion', 'else', 'might', 'be', 'mind', 'characters', 'often', 'resemble', 'writer/director', 'events', 'often', 'reflect', 'what', 'going', 'own', 'life.Along', 'line', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'might', 'be', 'Allen', 'most', 'personal', 'film', 'Harry', 'main', 'character', 'writer', 'who', 'dark', 'humorous', 'stories', 'typically', 'own', 'experiences', 'life', 'including', 'relationships', 'half-sister', 'three', 'former', 'wives', 'young', 'mistress', 'course', 'most', 'are', ""n't"", 'happy', 'find', 'out', ""'ve"", 'become', 'novels', 'latest', 'stories.The', 'movie', 'large', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Allen', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'actors', 'are', 'playing', 'characters', 'Harry', 'life', 'others', 'are', 'characters', 'stories', 'movie', 'page', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'author', 'going', 'back', 'different', 'times', 'life', 'prepared', 'be', 'honored', 'instead', 'flashing', 'back', 'things', 'actually', 'happened', 'history', 'often', 'given', 'stories', 'Harry', 'wrote', 'interesting', 'novel', 'humorous', 'way', 'put', 'together', 'film.This', 'love', 'hate', 'type', 'film', 'Many', 'critics', 'considered', 'vulgar', 'profane', ""'ve"", 'really', 'missed', 'point', 'movie', 'tasteless', 'times', 'only', 'illustrate', 'theme', 'film', 'Harry', 'despicable', 'person', 'real', 'life', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'artist', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'time', 'when', 'Allen', 'was', 'being', 'tried', 'media', 'events', 'personal', 'life', 'message', 'very', 'clear']",N/A
30592,AJ9W09EUQPAKE,0780621654,Sirin,"[3, 4]","In his prose writing, Allen superbly skewers the neuroses, ambitions and dysfunctions of major writers - 'and then Hemingway put on boxing gloves and broke my nose'. In Deconstructing Harry, Allen plays Harry Block - an alcoholic, neurotic, cowardly, pill poping, sexually deviant writer, on the back of three failed marriages, who incurs the wrath of his family and friends by using thinly veiled portraits them in his fiction.This is a case of art imitating life. Allen's own life is similarly contorted and complex, and it is common in America for its greatest novelists to have readers buzzing like private spies around their works trying to extract what is real and what is made up. Philip Roth in particular has mined rich fiction out of such workings. Allen, in similarly intellectual, self reflexive style gives us a fascinating movie where Harry Block is confronted by ex wifes and family members who despise his selfishness, his lack of human sympathy. This leads to some great dialogue. Try this for a classic Allen line when he goes to visit his sister Doris, who has reverted to traditional Judaism:Doris - 'You have no values, your whole life, it's nihilism, cynicism, sarcasm and orgasm.'Harry: 'Y'know, in France I could run on that slogan and win.'Brilliant.The movie is clever, but not without flaws. As with other Allen films, the female characters are not well developed. The whole movie is about Harry. Women are portrayed as one dimensional, intellectually subservient beings who fall in love with the great artist and have no other recourse other than to become hysterical when it all goes wrong. Harry sleeps with a lively black prostitute and persuades her to come with him the next day on his trip to his old college to be honoured. The whore is potentially a great character, but she doesn't really have a role to play once the trip is underway, she just hangs around in pink leather hotpants making the odd comment in reaction to Allen's neuroses, basically just a character to highlight another of Harry's flaws - the great artist trawling around with whores stereotype.Also the film is terribly edited - scenes jerking awkwardly into others. Perhaps this was due to a huge cast of high profile actors so a tight shooting schedule entailed insufficient time for quality filming. Not a big negative, but a shame nonetheless.All in all, an entertaining, funny portrait of the artist as flawed man.",3,"Nihilism, cynicism, sarcasm, orgasm",1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,2424,"['prose', 'writing', 'Allen', 'superbly', 'neuroses', 'ambitions', 'dysfunctions', 'major', 'writers', ""'and"", 'then', 'Hemingway', 'put', 'boxing', 'gloves', 'broke', 'nose', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'Allen', 'Harry', 'Block', 'alcoholic', 'neurotic', 'cowardly', 'pill', 'poping', 'sexually', 'deviant', 'writer', 'back', 'three', 'failed', 'marriages', 'who', 'wrath', 'family', 'friends', 'using', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'portraits', 'fiction.This', 'case', 'art', 'imitating', 'life', 'Allen', 'own', 'life', 'similarly', 'contorted', 'complex', 'common', 'America', 'greatest', 'novelists', 'have', 'readers', 'buzzing', 'private', 'spies', 'works', 'trying', 'extract', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'made', 'up', 'Philip', 'Roth', 'particular', 'mined', 'rich', 'fiction', 'such', 'workings', 'Allen', 'similarly', 'intellectual', 'self', 'reflexive', 'style', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'where', 'Harry', 'Block', 'confronted', 'ex', 'wifes', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'despise', 'selfishness', 'lack', 'human', 'sympathy', 'great', 'dialogue', 'Try', 'classic', 'Allen', 'line', 'when', 'visit', 'sister', 'Doris', 'who', 'reverted', 'traditional', 'Judaism', 'Doris', ""'You"", 'have', 'values', 'whole', 'life', 'nihilism', 'cynicism', 'sarcasm', 'orgasm', ""Y'know"", 'France', 'could', 'run', 'slogan', 'win', ""'Brilliant.The"", 'movie', 'clever', 'not', 'flaws', 'other', 'Allen', 'films', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'developed', 'whole', 'movie', 'Harry', 'Women', 'are', 'portrayed', 'one', 'dimensional', 'intellectually', 'subservient', 'beings', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'great', 'artist', 'have', 'other', 'recourse', 'other', 'become', 'hysterical', 'when', 'wrong', 'Harry', 'lively', 'black', 'prostitute', 'come', 'next', 'day', 'trip', 'old', 'college', 'be', 'honoured', 'whore', 'potentially', 'great', 'character', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'role', 'play', 'once', 'trip', 'underway', 'just', 'hangs', 'around', 'pink', 'leather', 'hotpants', 'making', 'odd', 'comment', 'reaction', 'Allen', 'neuroses', 'basically', 'just', 'character', 'highlight', 'Harry', 'flaws', 'great', 'artist', 'trawling', 'whores', 'stereotype.Also', 'film', 'terribly', 'edited', 'scenes', 'jerking', 'awkwardly', 'others', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'due', 'huge', 'cast', 'high', 'profile', 'actors', 'so', 'tight', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'entailed', 'insufficient', 'time', 'quality', 'filming', 'Not', 'big', 'negative', 'shame', 'nonetheless.All', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'portrait', 'artist', 'flawed', 'man']",N/A

So far, the character is just an extension of the same cynical New York-Jewish type that he has been playing for years. The originality is found in the stories within the story. The traumas and dilemmas that face Allen's character find themselves worked out in surreal and quite ingenious vignettes, firstly in the realm of his fiction, but increasingly in his day-to-day life, as things go from bad to worse. As ever, Allen exploits every irony, and is frequently hilariously sardonic as he explores the world of the archetypal, tragic neurotic, to whom life has dealt one hard blow.On the downside, the bad language is more frequent and offensive than any other Allen film, and the sexual content more explicit (visually).

30598,AEGBJ94DCVH5Y,0780621654,x_bruce,"[1, 1]","First off, Deconstructing Harry is a interesting, often funny film that stays on track right until the ending which, in light of the rest of the film is trite.This is a story about a seriously [messed up] writer that transposes it's way between reality, the writer's stories - frequently comedic and very funny - and balancing these elements into an easy to watch, mostly satisfying film.The character, Harry is a thinly veiled version of Woody Allen although at this point there are so many films Allen has made that contain his own experience the only thing that's different here is the intense level of hostility which actually makes for good contrast to the comedic segments.Typical themes of a Woody Allen film are here; self-loathing and the artist as incapable of having relationships with women that don't implode along with a new vigor for more explicit sexual themes and language. Once more Allen plays the anti-jew - at times he appears to have borrowed that character, if not part of the Harry character from Philip Roth's fiction.There's also lots of guilt, being a questionable parent, in-jokes about critics and media....it just goes on and on. And that is why I like Deconstructing Harry. Even though we've heard it before Woody Allen manages to develop the formula to a darker depth and uglier person. Harry/Allen is not a nice schmoe that anyone could find adorable as in many previous films. The 'self realization' ending rings false in the context of this otherwise well written and acted film. It is worth mentioning in his films after this one he is indeed more relaxed and mostly back to whimsical comedies.
