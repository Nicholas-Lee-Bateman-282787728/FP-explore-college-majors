This story actually had a lot of similarities to ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" just with a Duke and Duchess instead of a King and Queen....those darn men are always demanding an heir! Obviously though, that was something important in that time period.So, while I don't usually like period, historical movies, this one held my attention from beginning to end. One of the first times in awhile that when it was over, I was a bit sad and wanted to see more of their story. I did appreciate them telling you vaguly how their lives continued, but would have been more then happy to keep watching.Keira Knightley really surprised me, I don't usually love her, but I thought she did this role very believably. She was vivacious, passionate and tortured. Everything you need for a good duchess. The costumes and scenery were awesome. Ralph Fiennes is always amazing, in my opinion. Definitely worth a watch.Also, for once, great special features.

1213317,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B001L57ZZG,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[7, 10]","This 18th century costume drama actually stays fairly close to the historical record -- with some changes and adaptations. It tells the story of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who falls into a loveless marriage with an older aristocrat who only wants her to produce a male heir. They get into a weird menage with her best friend who becomes the Duke's mistress. Meanwhile, Georgiana is pining for the embraces of Mr. Grey, an aspiring Whig politician.With gorgeous gowns and wonderful hairdos as well as terrific locations in great English homes like Chatsworth, this movie makes for pleasant viewing without ever engaging the emotions. I did some research which showed it stayed fairly close to the historical record. It did suggest that Georgiana and Charles Grey met and fell in love when she was 17. But he was six years younger than her so that could not have been the case. (This was the Earl Grey after whom the tea is named. As prime minister, he passed the 1832 Reform Act, cutting out some of the worst abuses of the electoral system and setting Britain on its long path to democracy).The movie does cover Georgiana's significant political role. She is also said to have inspired Sheridan's ""School for Scandal."" She was an interesting and significant historical figure.The movie alludes to but glosses over Georgiana's gambling addiction. She died 20,000 pounds in debt which in today's money is a staggering amount of almost Madoff-like proportions.However these are minor cavils. One does not expect a movie to be a historical documentary. My main problem with this film is that I did not for a moment believe I was watching real 18th century characters. I felt more that I was seeing 21st century characters dressed up in 18th century costumes. They did not think or feel like people of their own time, which was considerably different from our own, but appealed to our 21st sensibilities.That particularly applies to the winsome (not to say anorexic) Kiera Knightly who moves languidly through the movie like a fashion model. The problem I find with this actress is that I rarely feel any real appetite for life in her -- for the good or the bad. Everything happens at a remove. Her way of portraying tragedy relies more on makeup than acting and she has an annoying way of sucking in her cheeks to indicate emotion.That said, I still give this movie three stars. It's eminently watchable.",3,Costume drama in which costumes are better than the drama,1241654400,"05 7, 2009",2009,2407,"['18th', 'century', 'costume', 'drama', 'actually', 'fairly', 'close', 'historical', 'record', 'changes', 'adaptations', 'story', 'Georgiana', 'Duchess', 'Devonshire', 'who', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'older', 'aristocrat', 'who', 'only', 'produce', 'male', 'heir', 'get', 'weird', 'menage', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'Duke', 'mistress', 'Meanwhile', 'Georgiana', 'pining', 'embraces', 'Mr.', 'Grey', 'aspiring', 'Whig', 'politician.With', 'gorgeous', 'gowns', 'wonderful', 'hairdos', 'as', 'well', 'terrific', 'locations', 'great', 'English', 'homes', 'Chatsworth', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'viewing', 'ever', 'engaging', 'emotions', 'did', 'research', 'showed', 'stayed', 'fairly', 'close', 'historical', 'record', 'did', 'suggest', 'Georgiana', 'Charles', 'Grey', 'met', 'fell', 'love', 'when', 'was', '17', 'was', 'six', 'years', 'younger', 'so', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'case', 'was', 'Earl', 'Grey', 'whom', 'tea', 'named', 'prime', 'minister', 'passed', '1832', 'Reform', 'Act', 'cutting', 'out', 'worst', 'abuses', 'electoral', 'system', 'setting', 'Britain', 'long', 'path', 'democracy', '.The', 'movie', 'cover', 'Georgiana', 'significant', 'political', 'role', 'also', 'said', 'have', 'inspired', 'Sheridan', 'School', 'Scandal', 'was', 'interesting', 'significant', 'historical', 'figure.The', 'movie', 'glosses', 'Georgiana', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'died', '20,000', 'pounds', 'debt', 'today', 'money', 'staggering', 'amount', 'almost', 'Madoff-like', 'are', 'minor', 'cavils', 'One', 'not', 'expect', 'movie', 'be', 'historical', 'documentary', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'moment', 'believe', 'was', 'watching', 'real', '18th', 'century', 'characters', 'felt', 'more', 'was', 'seeing', '21st', 'century', 'characters', 'dressed', 'up', '18th', 'century', 'costumes', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'feel', 'people', 'own', 'time', 'was', 'considerably', 'different', 'own', 'appealed', '21st', 'sensibilities.That', 'particularly', 'applies', 'winsome', 'not', 'say', 'anorexic', 'Kiera', 'Knightly', 'who', 'languidly', 'movie', 'fashion', 'model', 'problem', 'find', 'actress', 'rarely', 'feel', 'real', 'appetite', 'life', 'good', 'bad', 'Everything', 'remove', 'way', 'portraying', 'tragedy', 'relies', 'more', 'makeup', 'acting', 'annoying', 'way', 'sucking', 'cheeks', 'indicate', 'said', 'still', 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'eminently', 'watchable']",The Duchess

An arranged marriage to the older and wealthy Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) made young Georgiana (Keira Knightley) a Duchess.2. Unfortunately, the Duke was a man of few words, and the job description for his wife included only three tasks - bear heir; look pretty; no talking.3. This did not sit well with the vivacious, articulate and charismatic Duchess, whose baby switch seemed set on pink instead of blue, and who had a natural flair for partying and politics4. Soon the Duke starts triangulating the relationship, and the Duchess retaliates with a bit of Earl Grey.5. Everyone lives scandalously ever afterExcellent acting performances are given by Fiennes and Knightley, as well as by the always impressive Charlotte Rampling (Lady Spencer, mother of Georgiana), Dominic Cooper (Earl Grey, also from Mamma Mia!) and Hayley Atwell (Bess Foster, really close friend of the Duke and Duchess)The costumes and settings are breathtaking, and although somewhat lacking in depth, this movie adaptation of the life of Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire does not disappoint as pure entertainment.Amanda Richards, December 18, 2008",4,Let's give them something to talk about,1229558400,"12 18, 2008",2008,1274,"['Lady', 'Spencer', 'London', 'talking.Georgiana', 'Duchess', 'Devonshire', 'Oh', 'let', 'talk', 'Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary', 'SASS', ':1', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'older', 'wealthy', 'Duke', 'Devonshire', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'made', 'young', 'Georgiana', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Duchess.2', 'Unfortunately', 'Duke', 'was', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'job', 'description', 'wife', 'included', 'only', 'three', 'tasks', 'bear', 'heir', 'pretty', 'talking.3', 'did', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'vivacious', 'articulate', 'charismatic', 'Duchess', 'baby', 'switch', 'seemed', 'set', 'pink', 'instead', 'blue', 'who', 'had', 'natural', 'flair', 'partying', 'politics4', 'Duke', 'triangulating', 'relationship', 'Duchess', 'bit', 'Earl', 'Grey.5', 'Everyone', 'scandalously', 'ever', 'afterExcellent', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'Fiennes', 'Knightley', 'as', 'well', 'always', 'impressive', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'Lady', 'Spencer', 'mother', 'Georgiana', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'Earl', 'Grey', 'also', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'Bess', 'Foster', 'really', 'close', 'friend', 'Duke', 'Duchess', 'costumes', 'settings', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'depth', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'life', 'Georgiana', 'Cavendish', 'Duchess', 'Devonshire', 'not', 'disappoint', 'pure', 'entertainment.Amanda', 'Richards', 'December', '18', '2008']",The Duchess

1213323,AMIGVTZZIWS6I,B001L57ZZG,Amazon Customer,"[0, 1]","I went into The Duchess with low expectations; in fact, I don't think I would have rented the film if it hadn't been my only choice.  I mean, another period British drama starring Keira Knightley!  However, this film grabbed me almost from the start and didn't let go until the very end.  I think what made this movie so engrossing for me was the fact that it's based on a real person who is remembered 200 years later and was a relative of Princess Diana.  It's almost eerie how Princess Diana's life so easily mimicked that of her ancestor, Georgiana Spencer:  from the marriage that started out hopeful and became loveless, the husband's affairs, and the need to produce an heir.What this film also highlights is the plight of women in Georgiana Spencer's time.  The husbands were free to conduct affairs and create bastard children, but their wives could be beaten and have their children taken away at the whim of their husbands.  One of the most awful points in this film is when Georgiana confronts her husband about his affair with a woman he allows to live with them and demands to have her own lover.  What follows is most gut-wrenching rape in a film I've seen in a long time.  All the more gut-wrenching because you don't actually see the rape occurring; all you hear are Georgiana's screams as they echo throughout the house.  Ironically, it's this incident that leads to the birth of the Duke's much-wanted, much-needed, heir.I'm normally not a Keira Knightley fan, but she was simply wonderful in this role.  She truly becomes Georgiana Spencer.  There are several scenes that stand out for me: her hurt she feels when the Duke requires that she take care of his illegitimate daughter, whom she comes to love as her own; the anger and hurt displays when her husband's affair with Bess is discovered and Georgiana realizes she has no control over her life and household; and most especially when Georgiana must give up her own illegitimate daughter, which shows Knightley's full talent as an actress.The Duchess is an excellent film and one I'm glad I took a chance on.",4,A Gripping Drama,1232755200,"01 24, 2009",2009,2083,"['went', 'Duchess', 'low', 'expectations', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'rented', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'only', 'choice', 'mean', 'period', 'British', 'drama', 'starring', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'However', 'film', 'grabbed', 'almost', 'start', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'very', 'end', 'think', 'what', 'made', 'movie', 'so', 'engrossing', 'was', 'fact', 'based', 'real', 'person', 'who', 'remembered', '200', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'relative', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'almost', 'eerie', 'how', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'life', 'so', 'easily', 'mimicked', 'ancestor', 'Georgiana', 'Spencer', 'marriage', 'started', 'out', 'hopeful', 'became', 'loveless', 'husband', 'affairs', 'need', 'produce', 'heir.What', 'film', 'also', 'highlights', 'plight', 'women', 'Georgiana', 'Spencer', 'time', 'husbands', 'were', 'free', 'conduct', 'affairs', 'create', 'bastard', 'children', 'wives', 'could', 'be', 'beaten', 'have', 'children', 'taken', 'away', 'whim', 'husbands', 'One', 'most', 'awful', 'points', 'film', 'when', 'Georgiana', 'husband', 'affair', 'woman', 'live', 'demands', 'have', 'own', 'lover', 'What', 'most', 'gut-wrenching', 'rape', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'more', 'gut-wrenching', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'see', 'rape', 'occurring', 'hear', 'are', 'Georgiana', 'screams', 'echo', 'house', 'Ironically', 'incident', 'birth', 'Duke', 'much-wanted', 'much-needed', 'heir.I', ""'m"", 'normally', 'not', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'fan', 'was', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'role', 'truly', 'Georgiana', 'Spencer', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'stand', 'out', 'hurt', 'when', 'Duke', 'take', 'care', 'illegitimate', 'daughter', 'whom', 'love', 'own', 'anger', 'hurt', 'displays', 'when', 'husband', 'affair', 'Bess', 'discovered', 'Georgiana', 'control', 'life', 'household', 'most', 'especially', 'when', 'Georgiana', 'must', 'give', 'up', 'own', 'illegitimate', 'daughter', 'Knightley', 'full', 'talent', 'actress.The', 'Duchess', 'excellent', 'film', 'one', ""'m"", 'glad', 'took', 'chance']",The Duchess

If you were to ever entertain the idea of this young woman becoming a major actress with an Oscar nomination and more to come for that matter you would be deemed crazy.Keira is not the type of actress to get awards attention; is she?Then 2005 happened and she did a little movie called `Pride and Prejudice' and received massive amounts of Oscar buzz, and thanks to a seemingly weak year in the lead actress category Miss Knightley was able to land herself a nomination; a well deserved one at that (I love me some Witherspoon, but in retrospect Knightley should have won the Oscar).  That shining moment had a lot of people scratching their heads.Was this vibrant star really the bland yet pretty Barbie-Doll they saw two years back in that Pirate Blockbuster?Two years later they got another chance to revel in her talent when she starred in Joe Wright's (her `Pride and Prejudice' director) second film; `Atonement'.  She proved yet again that she has acting chops, this time missing out on Oscar but grabbing a slew of other nominations, including a BAFTA nod.  This caused many to claim she needed a certain hand in guiding her to greatness.  She was accused of only performing well for Wright, since she was still turning out mainstream fare that was less than impressive.Could she act without help?I think finally `The Duchess' gives us the answer.  This time she worked with another director and yet still turned out a fresh and inviting and beautifully crafted performance.  She is lavish when she needs to be, conflicted when she needs to be, charming when she needs to be and utterly devastated when she needs to be.  She is utter perfection.I guess now the question is; can she act outside of a `period drama'?I kid, really, because I am not judgmental of her talent, for I see she has it.  I know that some have raised that issue with regards to her acting ability, but quite frankly who cares.  If this girl starred in EVERY period movie made I'd be happy, since she does them so well.  Look at Emma Thompson; a wonderful actress who excels when she straps on the corset.  Same can be said for Knightley.The film tells of Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire.  Married off to the Duke and sacrificed into a life she did not want, this tells us a very sad yet realistic tale of despair and compromise.  Georgiana wants to love her husband but his interest in her is minimal at best; for all he desires of her is a son.  Sadly, she provides him with three girls.  This moves the Duke to pursue other lovers, even if it means hurting his wife.  Georgiana has her own exploits, which involve young Charles Grey, a boy she's loved and continues to love, but her relationship with him compromises her life in more ways than one.`The Duchess' is actually quite good, enjoyable and entertaining.  I was expecting something rather bland and boring, but that didn't happen.  I was intrigued and emotionally connected, so that I felt her devastation, her frustration and even her warmth.  The one problem I have with this film is that it fails to really flesh out the woman that was Georgiana.  We see that she was well liked by all but her husband, but why?  Sure, Knightley is ravishing and delightful, but we never get more than surface treatment from the script, which is more occupied with her living arrangements and love life than with what made her who she was.  The film, while entertaining and very watchable, feels one-note, and it had the opportunity to be more than that.The acting is superb and keeps us very much interested in the story.  Knightley is not the only gem here.  Ralph Fiennes has possibly had his best year ever, with three very strong supporting performances (see also `The Reader' and `In Bruges') and this performance is no exception.  Hayley Atwell is also wonderful here, very sincere and moving.  Dominic Cooper is pure eye candy (although some find him rather unattractive), but he also has moments of purity in his performance.This is the Knightley show though, just so we are clear.I personally recommend this movie.  It may not be as insightful as it could have been, but as far as these period dramas go it covers all the bases.  The acting is fresh, the dialog is intriguing, the sets are lavish, the costumes are gorgeous, the landscapes are breathtaking and the story is clear and touching.",4,Lavish and entertaining despite it's lack of depth...,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,4611,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'pre-', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'everyone', 'wrote', 'off', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'mildly', 'talented', 'pretty', 'face', 'young', 'actress', 'taking', 'backseat', 'bigger', 'names', 'big-budget', 'mainstream', 'action', 'films', 'who', 'happened', 'keep', 'work', 'thanks', 'impressive', 'bone', 'structure', 'were', 'ever', 'entertain', 'idea', 'young', 'woman', 'becoming', 'major', 'actress', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'more', 'come', 'matter', 'would', 'be', 'deemed', 'crazy.Keira', 'not', 'type', 'actress', 'get', 'awards', 'attention', 'Then', '2005', 'happened', 'did', 'little', 'movie', 'called', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'received', 'massive', 'amounts', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'thanks', 'seemingly', 'weak', 'year', 'lead', 'actress', 'category', 'Miss', 'Knightley', 'was', 'able', 'land', 'nomination', 'well', 'deserved', 'one', 'love', 'Witherspoon', 'retrospect', 'Knightley', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'shining', 'moment', 'had', 'lot', 'people', 'scratching', 'heads.Was', 'vibrant', 'star', 'really', 'bland', 'yet', 'pretty', 'Barbie-Doll', 'saw', 'two', 'years', 'back', 'Pirate', 'Blockbuster', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'got', 'chance', 'revel', 'talent', 'when', 'starred', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'director', 'second', 'film', 'Atonement', 'proved', 'yet', 'again', 'acting', 'chops', 'time', 'missing', 'out', 'Oscar', 'grabbing', 'slew', 'other', 'nominations', 'including', 'BAFTA', 'nod', 'caused', 'many', 'claim', 'needed', 'certain', 'hand', 'guiding', 'greatness', 'was', 'accused', 'only', 'performing', 'well', 'Wright', 'was', 'still', 'turning', 'out', 'mainstream', 'fare', 'was', 'less', 'impressive.Could', 'act', 'help', 'think', 'finally', 'Duchess', 'answer', 'time', 'worked', 'director', 'yet', 'still', 'turned', 'out', 'fresh', 'inviting', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'performance', 'lavish', 'when', 'be', 'conflicted', 'when', 'be', 'charming', 'when', 'be', 'utterly', 'devastated', 'when', 'be', 'utter', 'perfection.I', 'guess', 'now', 'question', 'can', 'act', 'period', 'drama', 'kid', 'really', 'am', 'not', 'judgmental', 'talent', 'see', 'know', 'have', 'raised', 'issue', 'regards', 'acting', 'ability', 'quite', 'frankly', 'who', 'cares', 'girl', 'starred', 'EVERY', 'period', 'movie', 'made', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'so', 'well', 'Look', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'who', 'when', 'corset', 'Same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Knightley.The', 'film', 'tells', 'Georgiana', 'Duchess', 'Devonshire', 'Married', 'Duke', 'sacrificed', 'life', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'very', 'sad', 'yet', 'realistic', 'tale', 'despair', 'compromise', 'Georgiana', 'love', 'husband', 'interest', 'minimal', 'best', 'son', 'Sadly', 'three', 'girls', 'Duke', 'pursue', 'other', 'lovers', 'even', 'hurting', 'wife', 'Georgiana', 'own', 'exploits', 'involve', 'young', 'Charles', 'Grey', 'boy', 'loved', 'love', 'relationship', 'life', 'more', 'ways', 'one.', 'Duchess', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'rather', 'bland', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'was', 'intrigued', 'emotionally', 'connected', 'felt', 'devastation', 'frustration', 'even', 'warmth', 'one', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'woman', 'was', 'Georgiana', 'see', 'was', 'well', 'liked', 'husband', 'why', 'Sure', 'Knightley', 'ravishing', 'delightful', 'never', 'get', 'more', 'surface', 'treatment', 'script', 'more', 'occupied', 'living', 'arrangements', 'love', 'life', 'what', 'made', 'who', 'was', 'film', 'entertaining', 'very', 'watchable', 'feels', 'one-note', 'had', 'opportunity', 'be', 'more', 'that.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'very', 'much', 'interested', 'story', 'Knightley', 'not', 'only', 'gem', 'here', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'possibly', 'had', 'best', 'year', 'ever', 'three', 'very', 'strong', 'supporting', 'performances', 'see', 'also', 'Reader', 'Bruges', 'performance', 'exception', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'also', 'wonderful', 'here', 'very', 'sincere', 'moving', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'pure', 'eye', 'candy', 'find', 'rather', 'unattractive', 'also', 'moments', 'purity', 'performance.This', 'Knightley', 'show', 'just', 'are', 'clear.I', 'personally', 'recommend', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'insightful', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'far', 'period', 'dramas', 'go', 'bases', 'acting', 'fresh', 'dialog', 'intriguing', 'sets', 'are', 'lavish', 'costumes', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'landscapes', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'story', 'clear', 'touching']",The Duchess

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 6]","***CONTAINS SPOILERS***A historical costume drama with some powerful performances, THE DUCHESS is the study of The Duchess of Devonshire and her battles with The Duke during their strained marriage.Little known director Saul Dibb gets a dream cast in Keira Knightley (Atonement) as The Duchess and Ralph Fiennes (The Constant Gardener) as The Duke. Thanks to Fiennes' uber-talent as a powerhouse actor, he helps pull the entire production up several rungs. Knightley shines unexpectedly bright in her role as the clothes-designing Duchess who steps into royalty and a marriage of the times; that is to say, something completely foreign to those of us in today's world.By contract, she is to be honorable and deliver the Duke an heir: a son. But three girls later and the Duke is becoming restless. He finds lust wherever his loins take him and the Duchess must simply bear it. A friend and confidant, Bess (Hayley Atwell), soon turns into a lady of conflict as she sleeps with, and then moves in with, the Duke. The Duchess tries to settle the matter but the Duke's power won't allow her any leeway.When a past love arrives in the Duchess' life, a powder keg erupts. Mr. Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper,Mamma Mia!) turns the Duchess' life upside down, and when she becomes pregnant with his child, the Duke's orders force her into an impossible situation: give the baby up (and give up Mr. Grey) or never see your children again.The terrible power wielded by The Duke is pulled off exceptionally well thanks to the high performance of Ralph Fiennes. Surprisingly you loathe him and then, as the film progresses, you actually pity him when he says things like, ""Look at them. To be that free."" His job and title have strapped him down and drove him into this role.The forced and eventual consummated acceptance of the Duke's power is probably Keira Knightley's strongest reveal for her since I've been watching her flicks.The costumes and sets are stunning in their elegance and appropriateness, as is the believable love that future Prime Minister Grey (yes, he actually becomes Prime Minister) and the Duchess feel for one another, even when forced apart by society and their own lives.This is a wonderfully done film with plenty of eye-candy sets and dark characters to make most movie watchers delight.",4,A Really Good Historical Costume Drama,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,2302,"['***CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS***A', 'historical', 'costume', 'drama', 'powerful', 'performances', 'THE', 'DUCHESS', 'study', 'Duchess', 'Devonshire', 'battles', 'Duke', 'strained', 'marriage.Little', 'known', 'director', 'Saul', 'Dibb', 'dream', 'cast', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Atonement', 'Duchess', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Constant', 'Gardener', 'Duke', 'Thanks', 'Fiennes', 'uber-talent', 'powerhouse', 'actor', 'pull', 'entire', 'production', 'several', 'rungs', 'Knightley', 'shines', 'unexpectedly', 'bright', 'role', 'clothes-designing', 'Duchess', 'who', 'steps', 'royalty', 'marriage', 'times', 'say', 'something', 'completely', 'foreign', 'today', 'world.By', 'contract', 'be', 'honorable', 'deliver', 'Duke', 'heir', 'son', 'three', 'girls', 'later', 'Duke', 'becoming', 'restless', 'lust', 'loins', 'take', 'Duchess', 'must', 'simply', 'bear', 'friend', 'confidant', 'Bess', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'soon', 'lady', 'conflict', 'then', 'moves', 'Duke', 'Duchess', 'tries', 'settle', 'matter', 'Duke', 'power', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'leeway.When', 'past', 'love', 'Duchess', 'life', 'powder', 'keg', 'erupts', 'Mr.', 'Charles', 'Grey', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'Duchess', 'life', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'pregnant', 'child', 'Duke', 'orders', 'force', 'impossible', 'situation', 'give', 'baby', 'up', 'give', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Grey', 'never', 'see', 'children', 'again.The', 'terrible', 'power', 'wielded', 'Duke', 'pulled', 'off', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'thanks', 'high', 'performance', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Surprisingly', 'loathe', 'then', 'film', 'actually', 'pity', 'when', 'things', 'Look', 'be', 'free', 'job', 'title', 'have', 'strapped', 'down', 'drove', 'role.The', 'forced', 'eventual', 'consummated', 'acceptance', 'Duke', 'power', 'probably', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'strongest', 'reveal', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'flicks.The', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'stunning', 'elegance', 'appropriateness', 'believable', 'love', 'future', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Grey', 'yes', 'actually', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Duchess', 'feel', 'one', 'even', 'when', 'forced', 'apart', 'society', 'own', 'lives.This', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'film', 'plenty', 'eye-candy', 'sets', 'dark', 'characters', 'make', 'most', 'movie', 'watchers', 'delight']",The Duchess

The lush, stylish costumes and  rich, elegant interiors were beautifully photographed and reinforced the message that there is often far more than meets the eye, for Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, lead a sad and confined life even though she was married to one of England's most wealthy men.  Keira Knightly is excellent as this naive 17 year old girl who is married to an emotionally distant, cold, privileged man. Ralph Fiennes plays the part of William Cavendish, the 5th Duke of Devonshire, in a performance that is frightening in its chilly control. The Duke is disinterested in his young wife except as one who will bear him an heir. He cheats on her to meet his sexual needs and is totally inadequate to meet her emotional needs.Charlotte Rampling plays Georgiana's mother, an ambitious woman who arranges the marriage of her daughter to the Duke and continually advises Georgiana to be patient and understanding even when the Duke has affairs with housemaids and brings an illegitimate daughter, Charlotte, into the home for Georgiana to rear. Georgiana has two daughters and several miscarriages, so by the time she and the Duke have been married for 7 years, she is seeking a more affection and emotional response whereas he has grown ever more cruel since his expectations for a son have been thwarted. Georgiana befriends Lady Bes Foster and moves Bess into her home only to find that Bess becomes the Duke's new mistress. Bess uses the power of the Duke to obtain her children from her estranged husband. Bess is manipulative and realistic but not without compassion and often comes to Georgiana's aid as the dark story unfolds. Georgiana eventually does have a son and is given a handsome sum of money for her own discretion. The pressure on Georgiana is now decreased for she has met the Duke's expectations.Georgiana eventually has an affair with Charles Grey, played well by Dominic Cooper. This young politician impregnates Georgiana and we get to see how gender differences impact the lives of women. Whereas the Duke was able to bring his illegitimate child into the home, Georgiana was forced to turn her illegitimate child, Eliza, to the family of her former lover.Eventually Georgiana is able to develop the distant, cool, soul blunting and spirit numbing sense of defeat that allows her to accept gross injustice and become a realist about the powers that society gives men and the powers that are denied women.

This time around the plot is not a Jane Austinish tale of romance and veiled aggression over the teacups, but a study of a personality - or rather several personalities, specifically the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, which sound a bit like a couple created for the express purpose of enlivening a Regency Romance, with a marriage so open that one could practically drive a coach and four through it, without risking harm to either party. She was Georgiana Spencer (Kiera Knightly in yet another corset), the golden girl of late 18th century British politics; beautiful, accomplished, well-born, adored by practically everyone who knew her, except her husband. The Duke was one of those grim, cold and emotionally-distant figures, devoted to duty, his social position and his dogs, in more or less that order - and yet as played by Ralph Fiennes, not entirely unsympathetic. The two of them eventually had a functioning marriage, as the 18th century aristocracy defined it - with the additional fillip that the Duke's long-time mistress was her best friend, and the three of them lived companionably together for decades.

Santas ""Constantine/film buff""","[1, 2]","In ""The Duchess"" (2008), dir by Saul Dibb, Keira Knightley plays Georgiana  Spencer, the Duchess of Devonshire (""Empress of Fashion""), a real historical figure.  She married the Duke of Devonshire, a marriage of convenience that proves disastrous. The Duke of Devonshire is played by Ralph Fiennes, who has not had a really decent role after ""The English Patient,"" eons ago. The Duke expects a son, to inherit him, and she produces three daughters in succession; he takes a lover, Haley Atwell, who is has three sons and is separated from her husband. The Duke cruel and relentless, torments his wife with his autocratic manners and constant infidelities. When she produces a son, after he practically rapes her, he relents and lets her re-enter society.  She takes a lover too, Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper), with whom she has a daughter. The film does not show her death, which must have occurred at an early age, but we are told the Duke marries Atwell, who becomes the new duchess.Keira Knightley, beautiful but still a budding actress whose girlish giggles prevent the viewer from taking her seriously, slowly matures into her role and eventually becomes believable. She plays mostly in period pieces--she probably is too beautiful to play an ordinary housewife, or any other character, as Kate Winslet and Cate Blanchett have done. Knightley is still a phantom from the past. But her contemporary mannerisms prevent her from rising to the level of seriousness such roles demand. As for Fiennes, he is almost as unlikable as the horrible Goeth of ""Schindler's List."" He scowls too much, and his make-up doesn't help any. Tragic--to some degree--he is also too much of a caddish monster to be forgiven for what he does to a knowingly compliant woman. ""The Duchess"" is a lavish and slow moving production; in more expert hands, it could be a reasonably moving epic. Its problem is the lack of dramatic turns. It has no moments of true crisis--just glides into the recreated opulence of London and Bath of two centuries ago, when humankind (at least in Europe) was reshaping itself.

Usually, I don't like these period pieces where usually the ornate settings and lavish costumes overwhelm the story.  This one intrigued me in a Tennessee Williams or John O'Hara kind of way.  Yes, the film is a potboiler but not one to easily dismiss.  The film teeters at time towards parody but ultimately it grounds itself in reality.  It helps that the leads are two superb actors.  Keira Knightley projects a stiff upper lip as the Duchess of Devonshire, a woman forced to suffer indignity because of the strict mores of the time.  Ralph Fiennes as the Duke of Devonshire adds weight to a role that could very well be caricature.  He imbues some modicum of sympathy to a man that is an absolute cad.

1213362,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001L57ZZG,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[6, 9]","Beautiful, passionate and heartwrenching.  Easy words to describe ""The Duchess"" featuring outstanding performances by Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes in a true story of Georgianna Cavendish, the Duchess of Devonshire and her husband William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire.Before the modern media frenzy covering the lives of Lady Diana Spencer, Princess and Wales or Sarah, Duchess of York and the men they were involved with in their lives, over 200 years ago, the story of Georgianna, the Duchess of Devonshire was the epitome of socialite, of high fashion to many.  But behind close doors, her life as the Duchess of Devonshire was not so pleasant.Back in 1774, a 17-year-old Georgianna Spencer (Knightley) was chosen to be the wife of  the 5th Duke of Devonshire, William Cavendish (Fiennes).  For Georgianna, she thought that married life was to be happy and imagined her husband to be like her father.  Talkative, loving... but the Duke was not exactly that type of man.In ""The Duchess"", Duke William Cavendish was a cold, emotionless man.  Rarely did he talk to his wife, all he wanted her for is to give birth to a son to be the rightful heir.  For Georgianna, she learned that her husband was not a good man, a good lover and a good husband.  He slept with women, in fact, having an illegitimate daughter named Charlotte who Georgianna raised as one of her own.  And by the age of 24, having given birth to two girls, the Duke was getting restless.In his mind, the marriage was an agreement that he gave her the lifestyle but in return she would give him a son.  And because she has not done that, she has been considered a bad wife according to the Duke.While at a party, Georgianna watches her husband asking another woman to dance.  Her name is Lady Elizabeth Foster, wife of politician John Thomas Foster who she had separated from.  She had been living in lodges and unable to see her children.  Georgianna, feeling pity for her develops a strong friendship with Lady Elizabeth aka ""Bess"" and invites her to move into their home.Meanwhile, at a party at the home, Georgianna comes across one of her good friends, Charles Grey (2nd Earl Grey).  Both of them have liked each other during their teens and Grey is now preparing himself to be a politician.  Grey has always loved Georgianna and Georgianna helps him get votes by making public appearances at his events and helping an old friend out.  But she realizes that their feelings from when they are teenagers continue to exist and realizes that Grey still thinks about her and has every day since she left to get married to the Duke.But all is not well when she returns back home.  She finds out that the Duke has been having sex with Bess and to make things worse, the Duke wants Bess to live at their home permanently.  Not thrilled that her husband has taken her best friend away from her but now wanting to keep his mistress in the same home.  This devastation has driven Georgianna to her good friend Charles Grey, the only man who has truly loved her and she truly loves as well.But what happens when the gossip papers (old tabloids) start to publish news of their affair.  Who will Georgianna choose?  A happy love life with the man she truly loves.  Or to live an unhappy life with the Duke and his mistress?  And how will the Duke respond to these rumors?A complicated but yet well-written, well-paced film that clearly brings out the recreation of the late 1700's and showcasing one of the most prominent women of England's past.VIDEO & AUDIO:The video is presented in 1080p High Definition.  The picture quality looks great on Blu-ray and the beautiful scenery of that time period is captured well on camera.  I will say that there are many parts where lighting may have been an issue because the picture quality seems a bit flat at times.  But there are moments where you do get vibrant colors but not eye popping.  If anything, the video does have a good transfer.As for audio, the film is featured in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD and despite the film being primarily a dialogue-driven type of film, the shining moments audio-wise for the film is the use of music which effectively makes a scene come alive in certain areas of the film.  There is also a French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital track included as well.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Duchess"" has several special features included on the Blu-ray disc:* How Far She Went... Making ""The Duchess"" - Presented in HD, this featurette was exciting as it featured interviews with the cast, but also people on staff.  From making the hairstyle, the makeup, the clothing, finding locations to film the movie and much more.  A very well done featurette.* Georgianna in Her Own Words - Presented in HD is an interview with Amanda Foreman, author of ""Georgianna, Duchess of Devonshire"" who reads a few letters that were written by Georgianna herself.* Costume Diary - Presented in HD, this featurette focuses on the fashion at the time and getting the costumes of that era look authentic in the film.* Trailers - Trailers for upcoming releases.Surprisingly, there is no commentary.  It would have been a blast to hear the director talk about the film since there was so much put into it.  I would have loved to hear Amanda Foreman who wrote the original book talk about Georgianna but unfortunately there is no commentary.As an American, I truly never understood how important Georgianna, the Duchess of York truly was.  I've always wondered previous to the film's release why some viewers made comparisons to Lady Diana Spencer and Georgianna (Spencer) Cavendish.  Even I was surprised to find out side that Lady Diana was a descendant of Georgianna's brother and to see the similarities of both lives fro two different time periods.Two women from different times who have similar story in that they were women who had happiness or lack of happiness in their well-documented lives with their husband, having to be in the spotlight of tabloids, loving mother to their children, enjoying the fashion of their time and being involved with certain activities, I can see why there have  been comparisons.I was even surprised to find out afterward how even Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York (ie. Fergie) was a descendant of the Duchess Georgianna as well.  Sarah Ferguson is the descendant of Eliza (the illegitimate daughter of Georgianna and Charles Grey).  And to learn also that the tea Earl Grey was named after Charles Grey and even his accomplishments as a Prime Minister during his lifetime.As for the Blu-ray, the special features were quite informative but I wished there was commentary for such an elaborate film such as ""The Duchess"" but you do get informative special features and overall, this film was just enchanting, passionate and breathtaking but at the same time, heartwrenching.From it's beautiful presentation, it's well-written story and it's top tier talent, ""The Duchess"" is a fantastic film and it's beauty captured well on Blu-ray!",5,"Outstanding performances by Knightley and Fiennes!

1213364,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B001L57ZZG,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[8, 11]","Earlier this year we were treated to a look at Tudor England in the film ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" that opened with magnificent diffused shots of lovely fair-haired children scampering carefree through a bucolic sun-infused backdrop. All those fat-cheeked cherubs with their hair flapping in the wind definitely testified to innocent times for even before these babes hit puberty they were immersed in political intrigue to promote their families and their legacy. Did it faze them? No. We, the collective modern audience, must not let our studied egalitarianism confuse what may seem as a limited and unfair way of life. Obsessed with the acquisition of a male heir, the men and women in this film and now in director Saul Dibb's ""The Duchess"" understand and accept their roles and move accordingly like partners in a precise cotillion to ascertain success. Both sexes were expected to perform their duties to maintain succession with nary a powdered wig becoming skewed or a piece of big two-foot-tall hair coming out of place. And after the blessed event transpired, the semblance of propriety remained with the ubiquitous stiff upper lip reining in secrets that were wild and woolly enough to curl the real hair underneath all that sculpted artifice.In ""The Duchess"" Keira Knightly plays the witty beautiful 18th century fashionista and politically correct Georgina Spenser Cavendish, duchess of Devonshire with a portrait-perfect insouciance that quickly sours once she realizes that her feather-in-her-cap marriage is nothing more than a sham that will provide the ennui-prone and rather dim-witted duke (the incomparable Ralph Fiennes) with the boy child he desires to carry on his name. Like one of her present-day descendents, (Georgina is the 4X great-aunt to the tragic Diana, Princess of Wales) the Spenser depicted in this based-on-a-true-story biopic wants and needs only affection from older hubby William and gets nothing but lackluster loving, a first-hand look at frequent dalliances with the servants, and the maternal responsibility of rearing one of his by-blows. After the birth of two girl children and multiple miscarriages, Georgina is faced with the ultimate humiliation: the object of William's infidelities has narrowed to Bess, Georgina's best friend, who fleeing her abusive husband has sought refuge in the Cavendish home.Not that the Duchess is any angel. From the opening idyllic scene (more beautiful young people running through green meadows) the audience knows that she is smitten with Charles Grey from the get-go. That she shares his politics--the Cavendishs were supporters of the infant Whig party--and his dream for a better world becomes more and more evident as her life with the duke wanes on an emotional level. G, as she is known to her friends, unwisely figures that if the Duke can have his cake and eat it too, why not she, the modern-thinking Duchess? Nevertheless, while attempting to persuade her husband to accept her indiscretion if she accepts his, G finds herself sadly outmaneuvered. Why would someone with so much power and backed by the buttress of convention agree to give a mere possession so much leeway? Poor G, as clever a gambler as she is, cannot beat odds that are stacked so unfavorably against her.Knightly shows her desperation with pink pre-Sephora-ed cheeks and pretty lip-glossed moues; slightly tipsy from the huge offsetting wigs, she seems off balance, her tightly corseted stick figure somehow not altogether in conjunction with the glamour of her spectacular face. Showing her strength in her somewhat rigid jaw line, she pouts rather than sneers like she did in the `Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy and still uses those expressive eyes and strong eyebrows to convey her desperation as she did in ""Atonement."" However lovely, she tends to jerk about in a flurry of motion rather than suggest the quiet stillness of a lady of that century.Fiennes, on the other hand, plays the historically one-note duke with a nuanced compassion. Undoubtedly the villain of this piece, Fiennes searches deeply for the soul of this character and somehow relays to the audience that it is not the duke that is solely to blame for all this wasted protocol but society itself. While G shines in the opulence provided by the Cavendish money, William willingly takes a backseat to her popularity always appearing faintly bewildered and aghast at being in the center of attention during any of the many public shows of affection directed towards his wife. However, when his omnipotence is challenged, Fiennes' reacts with the certainty that one would expect from a duke. The modern ideas of individualism did not exist at this time; the duke approached whatever fell under his domain as his possession and treated all as such. Softness is shown only to his much loved dogs, all else with the sternness befitting one accustomed to getting his way. G's airy desire for Utopia crumbles in the shadow of William's steely realism.From a purely technical standpoint, this film wastes little time on unnecessary scenes romantic or otherwise. Dibb tells his story with a precise almost terse rhythm punctuating it with the aristocratic Rachel Portman score that plays in the back of the audience's mind like Handel's `Sarabande with Variations.' Visually pleasing-- Knightly shines in over 25 elaborate costumes that make you wonder what couture houses were thinking back then for both men and women patrons--""the Duchess"" transports one back to an earlier time when life was as complicated as the clothing.Bottom line? ""The Duchess"" tells the story of an enchanting 18th century Spenser that like her modern day descendant must kowtow to a duty that robbed her of the romantic love she desired. Despite her obvious advantages--her life's similarities to that of Diana's seem uncanny as both shared a popularity with the public, were beleaguered by the paparazzi, established fashion trends and were extolled for their obvious love for their children--Georgina Spenser's relatively short life was dappled with the same marked sorrow that plagued Diana. Spectacularly beautiful, this film must be viewed from the vantage point of a society that expected much from their aristocrats and apparently still does. Like ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" ""The Duchess"" ends with the visual wish to return to an innocence epitomized by children running freely in a verdant field. Aristocratic money cannot buy happiness but it can at least purchase a backdrop and costumes that provide a semblance of what other people want. Recommended, although those viewing with adolescents or children be aware that the film contains a rape, a lesbian love scene and rather chilling scenes of loveless child begetting.Diana Faillace Von

Thurlow,"[0, 0]","""The Duchess"" is an exquisitely produced 18th century period piece drama, with a solid cast, first rate production values, and a rather depressing plot.  The movie insists on being interpreted on its own terms of 18th century social customs, morals, and laws.As the story opens, Lady Spencer (Charlotte Rampling) is arranging the marriage of her daughter Georgiana (Kiera Knightley) to the much older and very wealthy Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), who badly wants a male heir.  The young and naive Georgiana is suddenly the mistress of a great household at the center of society.  Unfortunately, when four pregnancies fail to produce a male heir, the Duke looks elsewhere, taking as mistress Georgiana's companion Mrs. Foster (Hayley Atwell).  Georgiana's own affair  with a young lawyer (Dominic Cooper) draws the ire of the Duke, who will offer his errant wife a fateful choice.""The Duchess"" is a tough movie to watch, although it is decent enough spectacle based on its production values.  Georgiana's spirited quest for her place in the world runs counter to her husband's desires and the customs of her time; the ending is not necessarily a happy one.

1213371,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001L57ZZG,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 7]","Step aside, all you bimbo models and psychiatrically impossible actresses--meet the former '5th' Duchess of Devonshire during her heyday. Some 15 years after marrying the Duke of Devonshire to serve as breeding stock, the Duchess, Georgianna (the ever-annoying Keira Knightley) stood aside for her husband's mistress. But in the glory days, the 5th Duchess was a politically active, beautiful, bulimic, drug-addicted periodical/tabloid legend.She was a fashion designer who is said to have simplified the gentry's clothing (consult Emma Thompson's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE). She took a strong hand in the apparently liberal Whig Party, even helping catapult Charles Grey to Prime Minister (and having a daughter with him in the bargain).I cannot pretend to know a great deal about these folk. I know from the wonderful DVD extras that the former Duchess wrote a memoir/biography, and the producers dug deeply into her private correspondence, to execute a wonderful film.This is a terrific treat for those who yearn to know about 18th century British high aristocracy and their pettifogging ways. The Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) seems a loathsome creature, yet he is actually the real-life forerunner of Jane Austen's Mr. Darcy. He wants a son, an heir, so the little Georgianna will do as well as anyone.This is a delicately told, yet straightforward, story. The atmosphere is incomparable, and my understanding is the film crew went to the places the former Duchess walked and lived. What a show! Though I think the camera is busy teaching us a lesson by lingering too much on Knightley (WHY do they always do that with her??), it is fair to all the others.It is a rich, enterprising undertaking to tell us about a poor young girl who was, after all, a victim of circumstances as much as all the others around her. It tells of political intrigues, conquests, seductions that even carry over to the Duke's mistress seducing the young Duchess. Amazing, the values these people had (and didn't have).In the end, let the former Duchess be a lesson to those such as Fergie, former Duchess of York--who recently visited my area--and others of that ilk. And get this beautiful film, gross romantic scenes notwithstanding. It is an excellent history lesson and with relatively little editing should be shown in schools.",3,Bark Like A Dog!,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,2314,"['Step', 'aside', 'bimbo', 'models', 'psychiatrically', 'impossible', 'actresses', 'meet', 'former', 'Duchess', 'Devonshire', 'heyday', '15', 'years', 'marrying', 'Duke', 'Devonshire', 'serve', 'breeding', 'stock', 'Duchess', 'Georgianna', 'ever-annoying', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'stood', 'aside', 'husband', 'mistress', 'glory', 'days', '5th', 'Duchess', 'was', 'politically', 'active', 'beautiful', 'bulimic', 'drug-addicted', 'periodical/tabloid', 'legend.She', 'was', 'fashion', 'designer', 'who', 'said', 'have', 'simplified', 'gentry', 'clothing', 'consult', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE', 'took', 'strong', 'hand', 'apparently', 'liberal', 'Whig', 'Party', 'even', 'helping', 'catapult', 'Charles', 'Grey', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'having', 'daughter', 'bargain', '.I', 'can', 'not', 'pretend', 'know', 'great', 'deal', 'folk', 'know', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'extras', 'former', 'Duchess', 'wrote', 'memoir/biography', 'producers', 'dug', 'deeply', 'private', 'correspondence', 'execute', 'wonderful', 'film.This', 'terrific', 'treat', 'who', 'yearn', 'know', '18th', 'century', 'British', 'high', 'aristocracy', 'pettifogging', 'ways', 'Duke', 'Devonshire', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'loathsome', 'creature', 'actually', 'real-life', 'forerunner', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'son', 'heir', 'little', 'Georgianna', 'will', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'anyone.This', 'delicately', 'told', 'yet', 'straightforward', 'story', 'atmosphere', 'incomparable', 'understanding', 'film', 'crew', 'went', 'places', 'former', 'Duchess', 'walked', 'lived', 'What', 'show', 'think', 'camera', 'busy', 'teaching', 'lesson', 'lingering', 'too', 'much', 'Knightley', 'WHY', 'do', 'always', 'do', 'fair', 'others.It', 'rich', 'enterprising', 'undertaking', 'tell', 'poor', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'victim', 'circumstances', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'political', 'intrigues', 'conquests', 'seductions', 'even', 'carry', 'Duke', 'mistress', 'seducing', 'young', 'Duchess', 'Amazing', 'values', 'people', 'had', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', '.In', 'end', 'let', 'former', 'Duchess', 'be', 'lesson', 'such', 'Fergie', 'former', 'Duchess', 'York', 'who', 'recently', 'visited', 'area', 'others', 'ilk', 'get', 'beautiful', 'film', 'gross', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'notwithstanding', 'excellent', 'history', 'lesson', 'relatively', 'little', 'editing', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'schools']",The Duchess

1213376,AY12DBB0U420B,B001L57ZZG,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","This review is from: The Duchess (DVD)Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""The Duchess"" starring Keira Knightly and Ralph Fiennes. It was a good movie, to be sure, and a very extravagant one and well worth watching, but I just didn't find the movie to be all that enjoyable. It was a movie that had all the markings of an Academy Award feature, but, in my opinion, failed to live up to that status. Well, on the positive side, the movie was just gorgeous. The photography was excellent. The depiction of the English countryside was magnificent. The costumes and physical setting were just overwhelming. Surely, this was ""Best Picture"" stuff. But it just didn't rise to that level. I'd say it was a good, but not a great movie.The acting was somewhat stiff and formal, as with a lot of British period pieces. Usually, it takes me a while to relax and fall in with the cast and the setting, and with the story. In this movie, it just didn't happen. The characters and their portrayal were unsympathetic. I just didn't care. The film never grabbed me emotionally. By and large, it was stiff and wooden and, although the cast went about their actions in fine competent fashion, it just didn't jell as a gripping story. In fact, other than being visually overwhelming, the royalty period-piece story as portrayed was rather dull and uninteresting.

1213377,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001L57ZZG,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","THE DUCHESS (based on Amanda Foreman's book ""Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire"" which in turn was based on historical fact) has been well adapted for the screen by Jeffrey Hatcher, Anders Thomas Jensen and writer/director Saul Dibb.  What was basically snubbed by the critics of the theatrical release as a 'fashion show with little else going for it' turns out to be a quite beautiful period drama.  The fact that the story is based on the life of the outspoken feminist and political thinker in the late 1700s - Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire - who happens to be an ancestor of Princess Di whose life in many ways paralleled the Duchess,  makes it more interesting than most costume dramas.  And yet, even without the obvious parallel in stories, this film stands well on its own, due to a smart script and a fine cast.Lady Spencer (Charlotte Rampling) coaxes the marriage of her beautiful daughter Georgiana (Keira Knightley) to marry the very wealthy Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), a rather boring dog lover whose only interest in 'purchasing' a wife is to gain a male heir.  Caught up in the dignity and lush homes and gardens of the Duke, the new Duchess charms all who see her - and the manner in which Keira Knightley wears the vast number of gorgeous sculpted costumes  gives credence to her appearance popularity and enhances her personal popularity as she looks beyond the surface to the hearts of the people around her.  When the Duchess is unable to produce live boy children (two stillborns don't count, nor do the two daughters she births), The Duke turns to dalliances both with the household maids and to the Duchess' newest friend Lady Bess (Hayley Atwell): the Duchess seeks solace with her childhood love Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper) and the tension in the household comes to a breaking point.  British etiquette rules, and the 'wife' must bear up under the pressure of society, a position the Duchess obeys but continues her popularity with the politics and social comments of the times - quite a daring feat for those revolutionary years in England, America, and France and the world in general.  How this singularly intelligent woman copes provides the resolution of the story.Keira Knightley is ravishingly beautiful and continues to impress with her sensitive acting skills.  The contributions by Ralph Fiennes, Charlotte Rampling, Dominic Cooper and Hayley Atwell bring finely honed characterizations to life.  Rachel Portman is responsible for the musical score that fits the production like a glove.  There is, then, far more to this film than a panorama of elegant costumes. It is deserving of a larger audience.

Ms. Knightley was perfect in each one of those films, especially ""Pride & Prejudice."" I'd also seen Ralph Fiennes in""Schindler's List,"" giving an intense performance as the villainous Amon Goeth.

It's a very mature and touching movie that reveals the well known double moral sense, the ethical deficit and the state of things in a Pre Victorian period that was convulsing just at the eve of the American Independence (1774).A very young girl (Georgiana) becomes Duchess, a dream come true for many potential female candidates. Her alluring beauty captivates this Duke, featured by a very weird behavior. He is not precisely a friendly company, a very discrete man, isolated from the madding crowds who ignores the basic principles of courtesy and good manners.She will soon realize this man hides much more than he really exposes. But when she becomes pregnant, will know he had a daughter named Charlotte (9) with a maid who passed away days ago.This awful truth will intersect with another fatidic and random event, when Georgiana casually meets a very disappointed wife (Elizabeth), who has been betrayed by her husband, and realizing her sad condition she proposes to live with them while the things resolve by themselves. That fatal decision will become the Pandora box the Duchess and will lead her to the very hellish entrails.The dramatic events and successive facts will plainly absorb the audience from start to finish. Thanks to a very successful script and astonishing edition process the tragedy will never stop because the multiple moral and affective obstacles she will have to surmount in order to survive and bear this enormous burden of insolence, cynicism and dishonor in her very home.Keira Knightley and Ralph Fieness make a tour de force acting. She epitomizes the brutal suffering without falling into hyper indulgence.Perhaps the only flaw has been the discrete photography.

Based on Amanda Foreman's award winning biography, ""Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire,"" the film documents the tragic story of the beautiful, intelligent, strong-willed aristocrat who formed a popular ""salon,"" which included the brightest literary & political figures of her day. She was also an active political campaigner for the Whig Party at a time when women's suffrage was well over a century away. Born Georgiana Spencer, the Duchess was an ancestor of the late Princess Diana, who was born Diana Spencer. Althorpe was the ancestral home of both women.At age sixteen, Georgiana married the much older William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire, in 1774. Awed by her new husband, the romantic teen bride had high hopes that her arranged marriage would succeed...or at least provide an amiable relationship. Unfortunately, she couldn't have been more wrong. The aloof, emotionally cold, coarse Duke was a notorious womanizer who wanted a male heir from his Duchess and nothing else. Cavendish did love his dogs, however. Bah!! He became more and more aloof and abusive to his young wife as she provided him with daughter after daughter and two stillborn sons. She even took in his illegitimate daughter and raised her as her own to gain his favor and some kindness, to no avail.Her best and only real friend, Bess, Lady Elizabeth Foster, (Hayley Atwell), betrays her, and Georgiana's home life becomes more and more like a prison with herself the only inmate. She does find love outside her marriage, but this forbidden relationship is soon nipped in the bud as the Duke threatens his wife with dire consequences if she continues the affair.Filled with illicit romance, betrayal, real historical events and characters, along with impeccable acting from Keira Knightly as Georgiana, Ralph Fiennes in an extremely strong & complex performance as Devonshire, and Charlotte Rampling as Georgiana's mother, I found this film to be highly entertaining and educational.

Read the biography the film was based on for more interesting details, because they couldn't be bothered with them in this movie. It seems that the director was more interested in lush visuals than characterization, dialogue, plot, or meaning. If it's lush visuals you want, however, you might like the beautiul settings and amazing costumes and wigs. I was disappointed because, while I highly recommend the book the film was based on, the movie felt so slight. I found Knightley's performance wooden, but I tend to find her face rather unexpressive most of the time.

Women are to be seen and not heard, submissive, and capable of popping out male heirs like they're living in puppy mills, or related toThe Duggars.  Georgiana Spenser Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire (Keira Knightley), is in such a situation.Her husband, Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), is a powerful, emotionless, and influential man who plucked Georgiana from her parents when she was not yet eighteen.  The idea was for her to shut her mouth, look gorgeous (which she does the entire movie), spit out a litter of sons, and casually dismiss the Duke's obvious troubles with nymphomania and fidelity.  During this time Georgiana learns to deal with her situation, becoming the talk of the town, friend to all, and epicenter of aristocratic, social gatherings.  One of the lines in the movie is that the Duke is the only man in England who is not in love with the Duchess.  When ""she"" fails to produce sons, the Duke loves her less, and takes his scandalous acts a step further; he nails Georgiana's best friend who's living at the Devonshire castle, and then refuses his Duchess' request to evict the third party of the carnally awkward m&eacute;nage a trois.  Marriage Twister!  Red Hand, Blue.  Lies, babies, rape, secret trysts, and perpetual infidelity ensue in this biographical tale.The costumes, set designs, locales, and everything involved with the presentation of the movie are spectacular.  No expense was spared, and that time machine feeling of being able to truly experience another era is palpable.  It should come as no surprise that a costume drama would have stunning costumes.  Knightley has said that being dressed for the part and wearing the massive wigs literally caused her neck pains.Aside from the aforementioned, the best I can say is that the Duchess is ostentatious in a positive way.  There aren't more than one or two truly captivating moments; it's just a competent and efficient performance by all involved.  It's not in the upper echelon of British period pieces, and plays out just as a reading of Wuthering Heights would - good, but not flooring.  If the movie took one or two risks similar to those of its heroine, this would have been considerably better.

Fascination is a notoriously difficult thing to reproduce on the screen, and though Kiera Knightley who here plays Georgiana is undoubtedly beautiful she's not someone who projects tremendous charisma or wit very naturally. The movie wants us to feel sorry for Georgiana because her husband (Ralph Fiennes) kept demanding she produce him a male heir (which she eventually did) and because he cheated on her with her best friend in some sort of sophisticated arrangement that allows her to couple more or less openly with Lord Grey (Dominic Cooper); it's hard to feel sorry for her since she's dripping in diamonds and gigantic wigs (each more spectacular than the next) and because the Duke keeps her in splendid palace after splendid palace. No one distinguishes herself or himself very much in this somewhat moribund period piece, and Ralph Fiennes doesn't have much to do as the dull Duke. Dominic Cooper, said himself to be quite a fascinator on the stage, yet again shows himself unable to generate much spark on the screen.

Georgiana's life became a hot topic with the publication of a widely-acclaimed biography and the interesting parallels drawn between her story and that of Diana, Princess of Wales. Both were trapped in loveless marriages, both overshadowed their rather boring husbands, both had to compete with the husbands' well-known mistresses, both were widely reknowned for their influence on fashion, but in the end both brought on their own destruction with foolish behavior. ""The Duchess"" gives us a rather black-and-white view of Georgiana--she's portrayed as a lovely innocent, but was notorious for running up huge gambling debts and problems with drugs and alcohol; this is only hinted at in the film. As for the Duke, despite Ralph Fiennes' attempts to breathe some life into this dour character (see the interview with Fiennes on the DVD), he comes across as a terrible tyrant until the very end.

1213398,A26X2TG93OTXVU,B001L57ZZG,Justin Heath,"[2, 4]","The Duchess is a superior slice of costume drama which manages to craft interesting, multi dimensional characters and an involving storyline from the well worn confines of the genre.Keira Knightley plays a very similar role to the one she played in Pride and Prejudice, a feisty, modern woman trapped in a male dominated society. However, whereas Lizzie Bennett's heart and character inspires affection, the Duchess of Devonshire's fosters only reproach and punishment from her traditional and patriarchal husband. Her performance is a standout and demonstrates why she is so highly rated in the face of many disappointing roles in other films. She brings both strength and weakness to the character. Able to deliver withering put downs at her husband and others, whilst showing the pain of her loveless marriage etched into her face.If Knightley is the lynchpin of the piece then it is Ralph Fiennes that elevates it above a crowded genre. Resisting the temptation to play his character as evil, instead he simply plays him as a man of his times. In Fiennes' hands the Duke feels no need to win any bouts of verbal jousting with his wife as he is secure in the knowledge that, as a husband, he is in complete control of the relationship. The Duke also clearly sees very little wrong in his treatment of his wife and acts, as he sees it, in a logic manner making the whole film feel more believable and, as a result, tragic.In terms of the cast the only misstep is Dominic Cooper as Charles Grey, who lends the wide eyes of a political dreamer but doesn't have convincing chemistry with Knightley and plays one of the more one dimensional characters in the piece. However Hayley Atwell impresses by playing her character so well it is possible to describe her as scheming, and manipulative as well as sympathetic and loyal without it seeming a contradiction.The film is deliberately paced so as to give characters and events time to breathe, encouraging the mood that the marriage is a car crash in slow motion, inextricably drawing all the characters further into the muddled mess of their relationships. Overall it's a fully recommended slice of real life costume drama that draws a multi layered drama full of compellingly deep characters from what could easily have been a one note story.",4,"Fantastically Gripping, Compelling and Layered Costume Drama",1231027200,"01 4, 2009",2009,2292,"['Duchess', 'superior', 'slice', 'costume', 'drama', 'craft', 'interesting', 'multi', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'involving', 'storyline', 'well', 'worn', 'confines', 'genre.Keira', 'Knightley', 'very', 'similar', 'role', 'one', 'played', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'feisty', 'modern', 'woman', 'trapped', 'male', 'dominated', 'society', 'However', 'Lizzie', 'Bennett', 'heart', 'character', 'inspires', 'affection', 'Duchess', 'Devonshire', 'fosters', 'only', 'reproach', 'punishment', 'traditional', 'patriarchal', 'husband', 'performance', 'standout', 'why', 'so', 'highly', 'rated', 'face', 'many', 'disappointing', 'roles', 'other', 'films', 'strength', 'weakness', 'character', 'Able', 'deliver', 'withering', 'put', 'downs', 'husband', 'others', 'whilst', 'showing', 'pain', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'etched', 'face.If', 'Knightley', 'lynchpin', 'piece', 'then', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'crowded', 'genre', 'Resisting', 'temptation', 'play', 'character', 'evil', 'instead', 'simply', 'man', 'times', 'Fiennes', 'Duke', 'need', 'win', 'bouts', 'verbal', 'jousting', 'wife', 'secure', 'knowledge', 'husband', 'complete', 'control', 'relationship', 'Duke', 'also', 'clearly', 'very', 'little', 'wrong', 'treatment', 'wife', 'acts', 'logic', 'manner', 'making', 'whole', 'film', 'feel', 'more', 'believable', 'result', 'tragic.In', 'terms', 'cast', 'only', 'misstep', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'Charles', 'Grey', 'who', 'wide', 'eyes', 'political', 'dreamer', ""n't"", 'have', 'convincing', 'chemistry', 'Knightley', 'one', 'more', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'piece', 'However', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'impresses', 'playing', 'character', 'so', 'well', 'possible', 'describe', 'scheming', 'manipulative', 'as', 'well', 'sympathetic', 'loyal', 'seeming', 'contradiction.The', 'film', 'deliberately', 'paced', 'so', 'give', 'characters', 'events', 'time', 'breathe', 'encouraging', 'mood', 'marriage', 'car', 'crash', 'slow', 'motion', 'inextricably', 'drawing', 'characters', 'further', 'muddled', 'mess', 'relationships', 'Overall', 'fully', 'recommended', 'slice', 'real', 'life', 'costume', 'drama', 'multi', 'layered', 'drama', 'full', 'compellingly', 'deep', 'characters', 'what', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'note', 'story']",The Duchess

Ralph Fiennes plays the odious Duke masterfully.

Also like Diana, Georgiana was the most important fashionista of her day, loved by the people, and the darling of the London gossip columnists.The exquisite costumes won an Academy Award and the grand English homes (including Chatsworth House where Georgiana lived with the Duke) are breathtaking.  The atmospheric photography features golden candlelight and natural sunlight.  This is everything a period drama should be - a riveting true story that's lovely to look at with flawless acting.

I sure was wrong though.  Yes, the costumes and settings are beautiful but this film is based on the true story of the Duchess of Devonshire whose troubled marriage and rather outrageous behavior was not completely unlike that of the future Diana who was actually a distant niece of this famous beauty.  Yes, she was beautiful and Keira Knightly, cast in the leading role is so strikingly attractive that she steals every scene she is in.Georgiana, the Duchess, was married at the age of 16 to a much older man who was intent on one purpose and one purpose only - that of producing a male heir.  Ralph Fiennes is cast in this role and he gives an spectacular performance as the cold and distant husband who finds it difficult to make even small talk with his wife but, as time goes on, somehow becomes more sensitive.  What follows is a series of ups and downs for the duchess as she bears several girl children and is looked at with contempt by her husband.  Soon, she makes a woman friend who has been abandoned by her own husband and the two exchange confidences.  But their relationship becomes strained, however, when she, too, becomes one of the duke's many mistresses.  Naturally, the duchess takes a lover and more complications ensure.I loved this film and watched it with my eyes glued to the screen.  I loved the pomp and the costumes and the very fine acting and directing.  This was a BBC film and it certainly captured the time and the place and the manners of the period.

The product of a society that relegates women to window dressing and child-bearing, at sixteen Georgiana is filled with romantic notions and little information about the demands of marriage. Frolicking with her companions on the lawn of her family's estate- including future prime minister and lover Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper) - Georgiana is thrilled to learn of a marriage proposal by the impressive Duke of Devonshire. All the duke requires is a male heir and his bride-to-be is certainly capable of fulfilling her husband's demands. On the pointed advice of her mother (an intimidating Charlotte Rampling), Georgiana casts her self into the role of wife, quickly disabused of any frivolous romantic notions on her wedding night. Unfortunately, Georgiana bears the duke three girls, her husband increasingly chagrined and ill-tempered as his wife disappoints him with the birth of each new daughter.Stoic and rigid when it comes to his wife, Fiennes plays the distant husband to perfection, indulging in extra-marital affairs and ignoring his wife's obvious suffering when she discovers his penchant for callous infidelity. Georgiana responds as best she can, given the restraints of society, becoming the darling of the social set, charming and witty, a trendsetter who captivates the imaginations of those who enjoy her company, male and female. One admirer is Whig party leader Charles Fox, but there are many. Georgiana is a skillful raconteur regardless of her deep disappointment with marriage. On an outing to Bath, Georgiana makes a new friend, a woman suffering the loss of her children through her powerful husband's interference. The kind-hearted Georgiana welcomes this woman into her home only to know the most grievous betrayal of all and the beginning of her deepest despair.Georgiana's is a tragic life, a woman trapped by society's expectations. Knightly captures the essence of this woman's dilemma, her fresh beauty quickly marred by the reality of her situation. The one time Georgiana dares to break from her restrictive marriage and cold husband, seeking love in the arms of her lover, Charles Grey, she suffers immediate repercussions, brought quickly to heel by the man who controls every aspect of her life, especially her children. English society is not kind to women when they escape the boundaries set by men. As much as Georgiana is loved by the public, her behavior is scandalous. Although a somewhat repentant duke welcomes his defeated wife home, it begs belief that Georgiana's life would really change for the better, save her acceptance of the limitations of the marriage. Still, this is a thoughtful commentary on the marriage of a spirited young woman who endures a similar fate long before the memorable Diana Spencer, her relative.

Georgiana is a passionate freethinker who likes modern day politics, drinking and even gambling on occasion. The Duke, on the other hand, is cold, mean-spirited and rather traditional; he desperately wants a male heir to become the next Duke of Devonshire. Despite their best efforts (not all of which are all that romantic) the Duke and Georgiana can't produce a son. The Duke blames Georgiana for not bearing him a son which only makes things worse. They wind up with three daughters, one of whom was fathered by the Duke before he even met Georgiana; the two sons they did have were both stillborn. The Duke becomes even colder toward Georgiana and he has encounters with many other women; and when Georgiana makes friends with Lady Bess (Hayley Atwell) even more unexpected results occur that shake Georgiana to the core.Georgiana eventually has her own romantic feelings for the young, politically ambitious Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper). Together they find true love and their mutual passion for politics certainly unites them very romantically.I could tell you more but then I'd be giving spoilers away and I don't want to do that to you!The DVD comes with a ""making of"" featurette and there's a bonus entitled ""Georgiana in Her Own Words."" There is a ""costume diary"" as well.The Duchess paints the portrait of a lady who is far from free despite having a prestigious place in society; and it doesn't disappoint. The acting, action, cinematography and more combine to make this picture memorable.

As far as period movies go, this one does not disappoint in terms of lavish costuming and set designs.  The story is also an interesting one, which unfolds in a very low-keyed manner which helps to underscore the outrageous events that shape the lives of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire during the mid-18th century.Keira Knightley is lovely in the role as Georgiana Spencer, an ancestor of the (equally) romantically star-crossed, Diana Spencer, better known in the supermarket tabloids as simply Princess Di. Georgiana's mother (played by Charlotte Rampling who looks remarkably good for her years) brokers an advantageous marriage for her daughter with the odd and emotionally remote Duke of Devonshire, played by Ralph Fiennes. Predictably, the Duke has less interest in Georgiana as a woman than he does in producing a male heir and their marriage quickly devolves into a study in procreation, minus romantic attachment. As time passes, Georgiana's situation is not aided much by the fact that she initially presents the cold Duke with two daughters. Worse, the Duke then begins a long-standing affair with one of Georgiana's closest friends, Bess Foster, with whom he also fathers a couple of illegitimate children; to heap insult on injury, he then insists that Bess also move into the home that he shares with his wife.While the story line of ""The Duchess"" probably doesn't sound especially pleasant, it is nonetheless an intriguing study of the strange social mores of British nobility and their steely adherence to obligation and responsibility, even in the face of abject humiliation.  Knightley shines in the difficult role as the lonely Duchess who has been betrayed by nearly everyone that she holds dear. Her performance is restrained but poignant and she brings a quiet dignity to the role of Georgiana that adds an interesting dimension to a woman who was just as dogged by public opinion as her 20th century descendant, Diana, Princess of Wales, would be.Georgiana manages to break free of the constraints of her unsatisfying marriage and indulges in her own scandalous affair; no great surprise, but her extra-curricular activities are met with a stern, if hypocritical, reprisal from her amoral husband, the Duke.The movie is an interesting one that may seem tedious at points as the palpable tension between the Duke and Georgiana is steadily building.  However, the movie is well worth seeing; the story explores the life of a most interesting character and provides a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the smothering, hot-house environment that typified the lives of landed gentry.",4,Who Says Costume Dramas are Boring?,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,2684,"['would', 'be', 'pretty', 'hard', 'be', 'fan', 'period', 'movies', 'not', 'Duchess', 'As', 'far', 'period', 'movies', 'go', 'one', 'not', 'disappoint', 'terms', 'lavish', 'costuming', 'set', 'designs', 'story', 'also', 'interesting', 'one', 'very', 'low-keyed', 'manner', 'underscore', 'outrageous', 'events', 'shape', 'lives', 'Duke', 'Duchess', 'Devonshire', 'mid-18th', 'century.Keira', 'Knightley', 'lovely', 'role', 'Georgiana', 'Spencer', 'ancestor', 'equally', 'romantically', 'star-crossed', 'Diana', 'Spencer', 'better', 'known', 'supermarket', 'tabloids', 'simply', 'Princess', 'Di', 'Georgiana', 'mother', 'played', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'who', 'remarkably', 'good', 'years', 'brokers', 'advantageous', 'marriage', 'daughter', 'odd', 'emotionally', 'remote', 'Duke', 'Devonshire', 'played', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Predictably', 'Duke', 'less', 'interest', 'Georgiana', 'woman', 'producing', 'male', 'heir', 'marriage', 'quickly', 'study', 'procreation', 'romantic', 'attachment', 'time', 'passes', 'Georgiana', 'situation', 'not', 'aided', 'much', 'fact', 'initially', 'cold', 'Duke', 'two', 'daughters', 'Worse', 'Duke', 'then', 'long-standing', 'affair', 'one', 'Georgiana', 'closest', 'friends', 'Bess', 'Foster', 'whom', 'also', 'couple', 'illegitimate', 'children', 'heap', 'insult', 'injury', 'then', 'Bess', 'also', 'move', 'home', 'shares', 'wife.While', 'story', 'line', 'Duchess', 'probably', ""n't"", 'sound', 'especially', 'pleasant', 'nonetheless', 'intriguing', 'study', 'strange', 'social', 'mores', 'British', 'nobility', 'steely', 'adherence', 'obligation', 'responsibility', 'even', 'face', 'abject', 'humiliation', 'Knightley', 'shines', 'difficult', 'role', 'lonely', 'Duchess', 'who', 'been', 'betrayed', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'dear', 'performance', 'restrained', 'poignant', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'role', 'Georgiana', 'interesting', 'dimension', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'dogged', 'public', 'opinion', '20th', 'century', 'descendant', 'Diana', 'Princess', 'Wales', 'would', 'be.Georgiana', 'manages', 'break', 'free', 'constraints', 'unsatisfying', 'marriage', 'indulges', 'own', 'scandalous', 'affair', 'great', 'surprise', 'extra-curricular', 'activities', 'are', 'met', 'stern', 'hypocritical', 'reprisal', 'amoral', 'husband', 'Duke.The', 'movie', 'interesting', 'one', 'may', 'seem', 'tedious', 'points', 'palpable', 'tension', 'Duke', 'Georgiana', 'steadily', 'building', 'However', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'story', 'life', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'behind-the-scenes', 'glimpse', 'smothering', 'hot-house', 'environment', 'typified', 'lives', 'landed', 'gentry']",The Duchess

Ralph Fiennes did a great job playing a selfish husband. Keira Had every reason to feel slighted and unloved. While you can't condone her behavior, you can see why she could desire it as a way to experience happiness in the midst of such a double standard in her marriage. The way the three of them (her husband, his lover, and the duchess) ate their meals together was positively horrible. She was trapped in a loveless marriage, and despite her love for her children, the continual rejection from her husband robbed the little joy should have had. I have to say that scene where she handed her only baby boy to her lover's family (on her husband's order) made me cry. I felt the agony of the character's hopelessness and grief.

1213429,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,B001L57ZZG,Midge,"[5, 7]","I was quite surprised at the quality of this excellent movie. It was extraordinarily well done. I had not heard anything about this movie prior to purchase. It was one of those movies Amazon had suggested when I purchased a copy of the Vivian Leigh movie about Lady Hamilton. So I bought, The Duchess"" with no prior knowledge of its quality or story.Since this is a historical movie about a true story, I really don't think the term ""Spoilers"" applies. But if you don't want to know anything about movie details in advance, you probably shouldn't be reading our comments... especially mine. So, stop here if you don't want to hear details of the movie.My first impression of the actress playing Georgiana in the very first scene was that she was pale and sickly looking. But she surprised me by giving a resounding, strong, believable performance of the real Duchess; presenting her as described in historical documents (which I read after watching the movie).I also later learned that her fashions, hairstyles, personality and details of her life very closely followed the actual Georgiana. The movie's attention to detail and realism by shooting in the actual palaces and ornate surroundings of the real Georgiana were stunningly accurate. Much better than they could have done in a studio or CGI. My complements to the producers and directors for their choosing real locations and following historical documents and paintings to duplicate the real life and surroundings of Georgiana.The movie failed to inform the viewers that Georgiana was a Spencer... a direct ancestor of Princess Di or that Georgiana was also a direct ancestor to Princess Fergie by means of a child Georgiana had with her lover. So, I had no idea of the significance of this Duchess when I watched the movie... yet I could not help but see both Fergie and Diana in Georgiana before I knew there was any connection.Without that foreknowledge, I had noticed that Georgiana (as portrayed) had a vivacious party girl personality when she entertained very much like Fergie. Yet she lived a tragic, loveless married life just like Princess Di and was beloved by everyone... except her husband. Her only job was to provide an heir for the Duke.Georgiana's marriage was tragic and loveless. Her husband blatantly lived with his mistress in their home for over a decade and later married that mistress after Georgiana died. Sound familiar... Camilla?The only love Georgiana had ever known was denied her by threats of losing her children and threats against her lover. So the one baby girl she had with her lover, she had to give up to her lover's family shortly after her birth and returned to her loveless marriage to the Duke. Her lover later became Prime Minister.It was ok for the Duke to have his mistress right in the same house... but Georgiana was not permitted the same option.My only criticism is that the movie producers and director should have let the audience know the significance of Georgiana's ancestral bloodlines shared with Princess Di and Fergie and that Georgiana was a Spencer... even if it was only mentioned by a text insert at the end of the movie. It should have been mentioned somewhere, especially for those of us who are not from the UK and don't know the minute details of Royal bloodlines. I had never heard of Georgiana prior to watching this film. If I had not looked it up on Wikipedia, I would not have known how Georgiana was related to Di and Fergie and how their tragic fates were all intertwined. There was no mention of this on the movie. After I read about her, it really brought more significance to Georgiana's tragic life as depicted in this movie.The similarities between Georgiana and her descendents, Princess Di and Fergie are quite disturbing. Almost a mirror of things to come. It was sad to learn that their shared ancestor, Georgiana had suffered a similar fate. A tragic story to be sure, but well worth the time to watch. If this movie didn't win any academy awards... it should have. An unforgivable oversight by the Academy.Ralph Feines was quite surprising in his portrayal of the Duke. Quite believable. I have a feeling his portrayal of the Duke was a bit softer than the real Duke. I was surprised to see him in a historical role like this after Voldemort and the Red Dragon... but he did an excellent job.My only other comment is that the print on the screen was much too small to see on any TV. It was so tiny, I had to get out of my chair and get within 4 ft of the TV to read it. (and I have a large screen). Filmmakers need to keep in mind that home audiences need to be able to read a properly sized font on their TV screen when the film includes text details for the audience. They should make allowances for this issue prior to releasing the DVD version.For those reviewers who have made derogatory comments on the costumes and hairdo's... they obviously have not taken the time to read about the life of Georgiana or looked at the portraits and biographies of her... or even bothered to watch the extra's included with the DVD. If they had bothered, they would have seen that this movie recreated the real Georgiana's hairstyles and unusual fashions to the tiniest detail. It may seem bizarre to us, but Georgiana was famous for her hair and clothes, which were a constant source of interest by the media and public throughout her life. Very similar to the same attention that Princess Diana attracted by her life and fashions. If this movie had not portrayed Georgiana's hair and clothing fashions as she had actually worn them, it would have been as bad as a 23rd century producer portraying Princess Di wearing dime store fashions. Accuracy is very important in historical films about real people. To depict them differently than they really were just to suit those with limited historical knowledge, would have been of the utmost disrespect.So don't listen to people with no appreciation for historical detail. With those attitudes, I don't know why they would even bother to watch a high caliber historical movie like this.To fully appreciate the accuracy of this film, I recommend reading up about the Duchess of Devonshire on Wikipedia and taking a look at some of the paintings of Georgiana.",5,Excellent movie!

The overall plot is not very deep so I think that those who have read the book that this movie is based on - Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire by Amanda Foreman might have an upper hand as to what was going on in the periphery.What the movie portrays is a beautiful woman (Kiera Knightly) trapped in a marriage to a man more interested in heirs then in his wife, so when the opportunity presents itself the Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) moves his mistress it the home to taunt his wife with a woman who can have male heirs; and only to make matters more hurtful, the mistress in question was once the best friend of the Duchess herself.Not to be outdone, the Duchess takes on her own lover and publicly taunts her husband with a game of one-upsmanship. Unfortunately, in the 18th - century, this cannot end well for the woman and so with what was once a shining moment, she now finds herself begging for the morsels of her former life.I enjoyed the movie, I just wished that I had known more of the back story so I could appreciate the overall portrayal more and understood who all the side characters were.Princess Diana Spencer is a distant relative of Duchess Georgiana Spencer and after watching this movie you do wonder if History does repeat itself.",4,What Comes Around Goes Around,1317340800,"09 30, 2011",2011,1395,"['Visually', 'very', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'are', 'stunning', 'came', 'away', 'thinking', 'was', 'missing', 'something', 'overall', 'plot', 'not', 'very', 'deep', 'think', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'Georgiana', 'Duchess', 'Devonshire', 'Amanda', 'Foreman', 'might', 'have', 'upper', 'hand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'periphery.What', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Kiera', 'Knightly', 'trapped', 'marriage', 'man', 'more', 'interested', 'heirs', 'then', 'wife', 'so', 'when', 'opportunity', 'Duke', 'Devonshire', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'mistress', 'home', 'taunt', 'wife', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'have', 'male', 'heirs', 'only', 'make', 'matters', 'more', 'hurtful', 'mistress', 'question', 'was', 'once', 'best', 'friend', 'Duchess', 'herself.Not', 'be', 'outdone', 'Duchess', 'own', 'lover', 'publicly', 'taunts', 'husband', 'game', 'one-upsmanship', 'Unfortunately', '18th', 'century', 'can', 'not', 'end', 'well', 'woman', 'so', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'shining', 'moment', 'now', 'begging', 'morsels', 'former', 'life.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'just', 'wished', 'had', 'known', 'more', 'back', 'story', 'could', 'appreciate', 'overall', 'portrayal', 'more', 'understood', 'who', 'side', 'characters', 'were.Princess', 'Diana', 'Spencer', 'distant', 'relative', 'Duchess', 'Georgiana', 'Spencer', 'watching', 'movie', 'do', 'wonder', 'History', 'repeat']",The Duchess

The tale is told using period piece splendor that includes excellent set design and art direction. A wonderfully done dystopian romance, its only faults are when it over emphasisizes some of the soap-opera like elements of the story. In a film this well made and acted, a minor quibble only.Set in the late 1700s, Georgiana learns as a young woman that she has been betrothed to the Duke, whom it turns out only wants to marry her so that she may bear him male heirs. However, after birthing only daughters, the Duke spurns the Duchess and seeks out romantic relations with her best friend (the soap opera element). The Duchess is faced with many equally terrible choices, and it is in her careful process of making them that Knightly truly shines as an actress. Bouncing back from her less than stellar performance inAtonementshe is at her best here, portraying the conflicted emotions of a feminist born before her time. The relationships between she, her husband, and her best friend in a sort of perverse love triangle, are very interesting and rich dramatic material that Knightly navigates effortlessly.Fiennes is her equal throughout, playing the Duke with his typical dark sensibilities. He is not a cliched villain with whom the viewer cannot emphasize. There is a forced quality to his life though which he commits atrocities all while maintaining the aura of a man pushed towards harshness by his role and responsibilities. He is easy to detest, but demands more than simple hatred. Fiennes' portrayal is believable to the core, and so well done that at times he dominates the screen in confrontations with his female co-star.The sets and art direction are superb. Interiors are often cast in the murky light of candles with studio lighting only added when absolutely necessary. The costumes are also well done and effectively immerse the viewer into the world of the characters. Knightly looks stunning throughout, and makes the film easy to watch for those who are not huge fans of historical dramas.A very well done film with an excellent cast, this is easily Knightly's best film to date. 4/5 Stars.",4,Unquestionably Knightley's best movie to date,1231459200,"01 9, 2009",2009,2290,"['Based', 'bookGeorgiana', 'Duchess', 'Devonshire', 'THE', 'DUCHESS', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'historical', 'drama', 'compelling', 'acting', 'Kinightley', 'Duchess', 'Fiennes', 'Duke', 'tale', 'told', 'using', 'period', 'piece', 'splendor', 'excellent', 'set', 'design', 'art', 'direction', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'dystopian', 'romance', 'only', 'faults', 'are', 'when', 'over', 'soap-opera', 'elements', 'story', 'film', 'well', 'made', 'acted', 'minor', 'quibble', 'only.Set', 'late', '1700s', 'Georgiana', 'young', 'woman', 'been', 'betrothed', 'Duke', 'whom', 'out', 'only', 'marry', 'may', 'bear', 'male', 'heirs', 'However', 'birthing', 'only', 'daughters', 'Duke', 'Duchess', 'out', 'romantic', 'relations', 'best', 'friend', 'soap', 'opera', 'element', 'Duchess', 'faced', 'many', 'equally', 'terrible', 'choices', 'careful', 'process', 'making', 'Knightly', 'truly', 'shines', 'actress', 'Bouncing', 'back', 'less', 'stellar', 'performance', 'inAtonementshe', 'best', 'here', 'portraying', 'conflicted', 'emotions', 'feminist', 'born', 'time', 'relationships', 'husband', 'best', 'friend', 'sort', 'perverse', 'love', 'triangle', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'rich', 'dramatic', 'material', 'Knightly', 'effortlessly.Fiennes', 'equal', 'playing', 'Duke', 'typical', 'dark', 'sensibilities', 'not', 'cliched', 'villain', 'whom', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'emphasize', 'forced', 'quality', 'life', 'atrocities', 'maintaining', 'aura', 'man', 'pushed', 'harshness', 'role', 'responsibilities', 'easy', 'detest', 'more', 'simple', 'hatred', 'Fiennes', 'portrayal', 'believable', 'core', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'times', 'screen', 'confrontations', 'female', 'co-star.The', 'sets', 'art', 'direction', 'are', 'superb', 'Interiors', 'are', 'often', 'cast', 'murky', 'light', 'candles', 'studio', 'lighting', 'only', 'added', 'when', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'costumes', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'effectively', 'immerse', 'viewer', 'world', 'characters', 'Knightly', 'stunning', 'film', 'easy', 'watch', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'huge', 'fans', 'historical', 'dramas.A', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'excellent', 'cast', 'easily', 'Knightly', 'best', 'film', 'date', '4/5', 'Stars']",The Duchess

I loaned it to my movie-fan Yuppie neighbors and they want to borrow it again soon, (I'm certain that they'll buy their own copy, they liked it so much.)THE STORY (mini-spoilers ahead!): A young and stunning lass of nobility is thrilled to become the new bride of the renowned and fabulously rich Duke of Devonshire (thus, she becomes the Duchess); however, she quickly finds the Duke to be rather a cold fish in the romantic aspect of love-making. Still, after talking with her mother about it she holds out hope for improvement of the situation. Then she discovers that the Duke has previously fathered a little girl who comes to live with them. Then she discovers that her best friend has become the Duke's mistress. Then she enters into her own love affair with Charles Grey (future Prime Minister of England)... and so on, and so forth. The subsequent complexity of events does not follow the normal flow as one typically encounters in such films of the historical drama genre. I should also mention that this movie features only brief sexual scenes and is in no way overloaded in that aspect.This tale is based upon the true story of Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire who lived during the late 18th- and early 19th-Century.I can definitely say this: If you enjoyedBarry Lyndonthen you'll like this film. They have much in common, albeit ""Barry Lyndon"" is a notably older film (1975) and more epic in length.This 2008 film is shot in widescreen, runs 109 minutes, and is rated PG-13.

1213445,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B001L57ZZG,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[3, 4]","The premise of THE DUCHESS, the theatrical adaptation of Amanda Foreman's biography, GEORGIANA, recreates the contents of the book with Keira Knightley portraying Georgiana or ""G"" and her tumultuous arranged marriage to the Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) and complex relationship that ensues as the Duke participates in extra-marital affairs, which includes one of G's only confidantes, Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell). G decides two can play that game and she too ventures into the path of infidelity and secretly meets with an old brief acquaintance and political partner, Charles Grey (Dominic Grey).The film is twofold. First, the Duke and Duchess experience the ups and downs of their marriage and second, the romance between the Georgiana and Charles. The Duke's storyline and somewhat tiresome demeanor shows his controlling nature and dire need to make G conceive a male heir that emphasizes the aristocratic tradition. There was an attempt to include a subtle hint of humor within the film with Fiennes's character; this can be displayed with his continuous doting with his two dogs.Second, Georgiana and Charles's relationship was far more romantic.  But it would have been interesting to see more of the couple's political collaboration, which may have added another hour to the film.

The only reality here is the answer for the question, what was Kiera Knightley thinking in taking this role?This plodding flick is plotless.  A young English beauty marries an older self-absorbed duke resulting is the usual, for 21st century Hollywood, unhappy life.  So what?  The human experience has long proved that aristocracy offers only anguish and pain for the non-aristocratic.  Where's the point here?The cold duke only wants a son from his marriage, Knightley's duchess wants a fidelous and warm marriage.  The duke gets his wish, the duchess doesn't.  One is moved to sorrow for her, and for the screenplay's lost potential.The scenery, costuming, and acting in this movie save it from complete doom.  Knightley and Fiennes give convincing performances.  Kiera reflects highbrow addiction to beauty while Ralph's adept pomposity confesses English absenteeism.

A less capable actor might have played this as a flat, one-dimensional personality. Kiera Knightly is generally pretty good as the Duchesss, but it seemed like she didn't quite have a strong enough presence to make this film as compelling as I thought it could have been. A part of that may be that her looks are very striking-21st century-supermodelish and I found this to be a distraction, and that made it hard for me to stay in the time period.Despite the fairly good pacing, something in the story line is lacking. There is no real ""punch"" here..leaving the unfolding of events a little colorless and flat. One of the biggest criticisms I have is in the development of the relationship between the Duchess and Charles Grey - this could've been built up better; also, these two actors seemed to have zero chemistry together.The costumes, settings and scenery are enchanting enough that I would have been content to watch this even if it had no plot.

Excellent performances from newcomers Dominic Cooper & Hayley Atwill, and it's always good to see the very under-rated Charlotte Rampling, though her role is small.

My history sucks so I'm not sure if it is or it isn't, but it's still an excellent film.  Reviewer Terrance Allen called it a ""Costume Drama"", and his words are to the point and true.  'The Duchess' is a visual and audio array pleasing to the senses.The year is 1774.  Georgiana (Keira Knightly - King Arthur, Pirates Of The Caribbean) is to marry William, the Duke Of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes).  Lady Spencer (Charlotte Rampling - Swimming Pool) is excited to give her daughter away to the Duke, though she knows the only reason the Duke is marrying her daughter is to produce an heir to his title.Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper) is a young, up and coming society male.  He's to go to college and he studies to become a politician.  Though they met before her marriage, Georgiana takes an interest in Charles because her passions are politics and gambling.  As her marriage decays, especially after inviting her friend Elizabeth ""Bess"" Foster who betrays her friendship by striking up an affair with the Duke, Georgiana finds herself even more drawn to young Grey.The music and photography are stunning; the costume design, sets, and visuals are spectacular.  I'm not fond of Ralph Fiennes, but I find him very appropriate in the role of the Duke.  His acting was better than it's ever been.  Georgiana is saucy and intelligent, the scriptwriter dialogue is well done and makes for great characters that you find yourself involved with.  On a funny note, all this talk about having sons during the era is quite humorous in today's world, where we know that the sex of the child is determined by the sperm of the father.  In the movie's era, though, it was the woman who was blamed for the birth of daughters.While a beautiful movie, it's a sad tale.  The position of women in that era was so restricted that they were helplessly dependent on men.  Georgiana's trials are heartrending, and her husband is a cold man incapable of seeing women as anything more than an object he owns.  I loved this film, the beauty of it and the subject of material.  While the film claims to be based on a true story, I'm not historically competent enough to judge if it is or isn't.

1213457,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B001L57ZZG,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 5]","I am a big fan of virtually everyone involved in the making of ""The Duchess.""  Certainly the actors, led by Keira Knightley and Ralph Feinnes, are top-notch.  The look of the picture is beyond sumptuous, and who couldn't be intrigued by the tale of a real-life 18th-century populist-noble who introduces her cheating spouse as ""our husband"" when walking with her hubbie and his mistress?Unfortunately, there's plenty wrong with this picture.  Ultimately, it seems as if the filmmakers stopped after creating visual splendor - this movie has all the heart and subtlety of ""Under the Tuscan Sun,"" that classic movie that wasn't content with showing a movie-perfect kiss on the Italian seaside, but had to introduce a cute-as-a-button kitten into the mix in case you weren't already feeling good enough.Here, much of the problem can actually be laid at casting with Keira Knightley.  It's not that she does a bad job, but she's just wrong for the part.  At the beginning of the movie, she's cast perfectly.  Her character, Georgiana, is a nubile 16 and ready to be married off to the Duke of Devonshire (Feinnes), perhaps the wealthiest man in England.  That's all well and good, and Knightley is perfectly vivacious and beautiful.But the story is about Georgiana's struggles with life as her husband proves to be a first-rate prat and boor, more interested in his dogs as companions than his wife - whose sole purpose is to give him a son.  But after Georgiana has multiple babies (both living and stillborn), she.  Still. Looks. Like.  Keira.  Knightley.  She does not age.  She does not gain a pound.  Knightley's collarbones are as pronounced by the end of the movie as they are at the beginning, and that's just not what happens when you've had six or seven kids.All this reminded me of the scene in ""Notting Hill"" where Hugh Grant tracks down Julia Roberts on a film set and sees her dressed in period-costume.  All the time I watched ""The Duchess,"" I was aware of the fact that I was watching a production.  This was not a movie I could disappear into and watch characters - I was watching people act.

1213458,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B001L57ZZG,Sean Curley,"[76, 78]","A lot of people think of British period drama as stuffy and boring, a reputation it occasionally does something to deserve, but history is anything but dull, and if you were under the impression that the past was a place of strong moral values and happy marriages that has given way to our current immoral society full of single parents and extramarital affairs, think again.  Consider the subject of the life of Georgiana Spenser Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire (Keira Knightley).Married young by her mother (Charlotte Rampling, in a wonderfully controlled performance) to William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), the foremost peer of the realm, she finds quickly that her husband (who she met only twice beforehand) is a cold and distant fellow who is only interested in a male heir.  Already tasked to mother his bastard daughter Charlotte, she gives birth to two daughters, to the disgust of the Duke, who has a series of mistresses that she tolerates.  The Duchess becomes a social marvel, hobnobbing with Whig politicians like Charles James Fox (Simon McBurney) and Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper, later 2nd Earl Grey and Prime Minister) and politician/esteemed playwright Richard Sheridan (Aidan McArdle), whose ""School for Scandal"" was based heavily on the Cavendishes' marriage.  She eventually finds a close friend in Lady Elizabeth (Bess) Foster (Hayley Atwell), and invites her to live with them, which turns out to have dangerous consequences when the Duke initiates an affair with her, and refuses to expel her.  She then finds herself living in a forced menage a trois (subtle humour found in the three of them eating silent breakfasts together).  Understandably, she finds herself increasingly drawn to Grey.The dramatic core of ""The Duchess"" is an examination of the limited social prospects for women in this period (though, as an aside, one imagines a great many poor women from this period would gladly enter a loveless marriage to live like Georgiana does), and their limited legal rights.  Both Bess and Georgiana face adulterous husbands who hold over them the prospect of never seeing their children again as a price of leaving; getting her children back is, indeed, Bess's motive for embarking on her affair with the Duke, who, as a powerful lord, is easily able to finagle it.  Georgiana, likewise, initially decides to choose freedom over her daughters, but cannot.  The Duke, for his part, is a controlling fellow, raised in a very patriarchal worldview; Fiennes expertly shows his emotional straitjacketing, which at odd moments make him mildly sympathetic, though he mostly is not, particularly at the conception of his long-desired son.  He's normally at a loss when called to talk about feelings.Keira Knightley, once again travelling back in time to the 18th century (her fifth or sixth visit, I believe), does a fine job as Georgiana.  Hayley Atwell is likewise very good as Bess, a character who walks the finest line between sympathy and dislike from the audience.  There's a curious scene included which seems to suggest at a rather different dynamic between the two women, though this doesn't go anywhere.  Fiennes, as mentioned, does his best in a rather staid role.  Dominic Cooper as the young semi-radical Grey is suitable, though not of the same calibre as the other actors.  McBurney and McArdle are scene-stealers in small parts as Georgiana's sympathetic male acquaintances.  The set design, as one would expect, is stunning.While not in the highest tier of British period pieces, this is a fine addition to the genre.",4,A well-done period drama.,1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,3577,"['lot', 'people', 'think', 'British', 'period', 'drama', 'stuffy', 'boring', 'reputation', 'occasionally', 'something', 'deserve', 'history', 'anything', 'dull', 'were', 'impression', 'past', 'was', 'place', 'strong', 'moral', 'values', 'happy', 'marriages', 'given', 'way', 'current', 'immoral', 'society', 'full', 'single', 'parents', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'think', 'again', 'Consider', 'subject', 'life', 'Georgiana', 'Spenser', 'Cavendish', 'Duchess', 'Devonshire', 'Keira', 'Knightley', '.Married', 'young', 'mother', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'wonderfully', 'controlled', 'performance', 'William', 'Cavendish', 'Duke', 'Devonshire', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'foremost', 'peer', 'realm', 'quickly', 'husband', 'who', 'met', 'only', 'twice', 'beforehand', 'cold', 'distant', 'fellow', 'who', 'only', 'interested', 'male', 'heir', 'Already', 'tasked', 'mother', 'bastard', 'daughter', 'Charlotte', 'birth', 'two', 'daughters', 'disgust', 'Duke', 'who', 'series', 'mistresses', 'Duchess', 'social', 'marvel', 'hobnobbing', 'Whig', 'politicians', 'Charles', 'James', 'Fox', 'Simon', 'McBurney', 'Charles', 'Grey', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'later', '2nd', 'Earl', 'Grey', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'politician/esteemed', 'playwright', 'Richard', 'Sheridan', 'Aidan', 'McArdle', 'School', 'Scandal', 'was', 'based', 'heavily', 'Cavendishes', 'marriage', 'eventually', 'close', 'friend', 'Lady', 'Elizabeth', 'Bess', 'Foster', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'live', 'out', 'have', 'dangerous', 'consequences', 'when', 'Duke', 'affair', 'expel', 'then', 'living', 'forced', 'menage', 'trois', 'subtle', 'humour', 'found', 'three', 'eating', 'silent', 'breakfasts', 'together', 'Understandably', 'increasingly', 'drawn', 'Grey.The', 'dramatic', 'core', 'Duchess', 'examination', 'limited', 'social', 'prospects', 'women', 'period', 'though', 'aside', 'one', 'great', 'many', 'poor', 'women', 'period', 'would', 'gladly', 'enter', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'live', 'Georgiana', 'limited', 'legal', 'rights', 'Bess', 'Georgiana', 'face', 'adulterous', 'husbands', 'who', 'hold', 'prospect', 'never', 'seeing', 'children', 'again', 'price', 'leaving', 'getting', 'children', 'back', 'indeed', 'Bess', 'motive', 'embarking', 'affair', 'Duke', 'who', 'powerful', 'lord', 'easily', 'able', 'finagle', 'Georgiana', 'likewise', 'initially', 'choose', 'freedom', 'daughters', 'can', 'not', 'Duke', 'part', 'controlling', 'fellow', 'raised', 'very', 'patriarchal', 'worldview', 'Fiennes', 'expertly', 'emotional', 'straitjacketing', 'odd', 'moments', 'make', 'mildly', 'sympathetic', 'mostly', 'not', 'particularly', 'conception', 'long-desired', 'son', 'normally', 'loss', 'when', 'called', 'talk', 'feelings.Keira', 'Knightley', 'once', 'again', 'travelling', 'back', 'time', '18th', 'century', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'visit', 'believe', 'fine', 'job', 'Georgiana', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'likewise', 'very', 'good', 'Bess', 'character', 'who', 'finest', 'line', 'sympathy', 'dislike', 'audience', 'curious', 'scene', 'included', 'suggest', 'rather', 'different', 'dynamic', 'two', 'women', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'Fiennes', 'mentioned', 'best', 'rather', 'staid', 'role', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'young', 'semi-radical', 'Grey', 'suitable', 'not', 'same', 'calibre', 'other', 'actors', 'McBurney', 'McArdle', 'are', 'scene-stealers', 'small', 'parts', 'Georgiana', 'sympathetic', 'male', 'acquaintances', 'set', 'design', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'stunning.While', 'not', 'highest', 'tier', 'British', 'period', 'pieces', 'fine', 'addition', 'genre']",The Duchess

The Duke is desperate for a male heir, and soon, Georgiana soon finds herself in a loveless marriage and the mother of three girls - two born of Georgiana and one born of a maid who had an affair with Devonshire. Even after bearing the indignities of her husband constant affairs, Georgiana becomes a darling of English society, known for her fashion sense, political activism, and love of gambling.But Georgiana draws the line, or tries to draw the line, when Devonshire takes a live-in lover and her three children. She eventually begins an affair with a young politician that threatens her way of life.The film paints an appropriately bleak picture of what it was like for a woman in those days. Georgiana is a beautiful, intelligent, and charming young woman whose only hope in life is that she happens to marry someone who loves her and will treat her like a human being. As it turns out, Devonshire becomes increasingly unlikeable as he expects Georgiana to abide by his affairs, then sit in silence as he keeps another woman and her children under their roof, and not just any woman, but one that had become a good friend of Georgiana.The movie is beautifully filmed and the performances are very good.

Spirited and adored by the public at large she quickly found her marriage to be a disappointment, defined by her duty to produce a male heir and the Duke's philandering and callous indifference to her. She befriends Lady Bess but finds she is once again betrayed by her husband who wields his power with the three eventually living uncomfortably together. Against this background, and with the pressures of an unfaithful husband,strict social pressures and constant public scrutiny, Georgiana falls passionately in love with Charles Grey, a rising young Whig politician. However, despite his ongoing liaison with Lady Bess, the Duke refuses to allow her to continue the affair and threatens to take her children from her.

The characters were indeed real human beings, though in the film they hardly acted it. I suppose if you were filthy rich, even during that particular time period, you could pretty much do whatever you wanted, female or not.Kiera Knightley plays said Duchess with perfect finesse and completely looks the part. She is never uncomfortable and she holds her own even when she is forced to share the spotlight with the incomparable Ralph Fiennes. The two lack chemistry, but that is exactly what it is supposed to look like; what supposedly actually happened. He is cold and distant and she is young and the complete opposite. He only wants for an heir, a male one at that. He is not happy when she begins spitting out one, two little baby girls.His actions are harsh and intimidating, though never at the beginning of their marriage. It is only when things begin to fall apart in more ways than one when things get a bit nasty for everyone. It is a joy to watch the two of them on screen together.The fault of the film is not with the acting. That is the only thing keeping this movie afloat. That, and the absolutely glorious looking costumes that litter every scene. It is a feast for every period film loving man or woman. By far the best costumes I've seen in any period film. No, the fault lies with the length of the film. It just feels long. There is not much of a plot to be honest. After the first hour of bickering and flirting and babies, it becomes repetitive and almost unrealistic. There are love triangles and threats and typical angsty plot lines that are neither interesting nor inventive.While historically, some things portrayed in the film DID happen, alot of it feels made up and I found the end to be predictable and unsatisfying. I will not reveal anything here, for those that do not know the story that well. To me, it just seemed a bit odd and unspectacular.

I kept hoping she'd hit him over the head with a roasted pig or something. Instead, she puts up with his mistress and her one stab at freedom (having an affair) only leads to more sorrow. Defeat followed by yet another defeat, ending with resignation to what her husband wants. Yes, it's all true, but the real Georgiana had an adoring public and was admired by many. There are hints of her spirit here, but in the movie it's more about how Georgiana was a victim forever. It's hard to like a movie when it's all about victimhood. You kept wanting Ralph Fiennes to get his comeuppance, but it never does. Instead, we're asked to feel a little sorry for him, even though everything in the movie is done according to his terms (eventually even his wife's love affair).

In fact, I would say that this is the most emotionally charged film of the previous year, and possibly the best performance (and yes, I have seen the over hyped ""Dark Knight"". I wasn't thrilled).Knightly actually looks healthy, glowing, and absolutely radiant in the role of Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire whose social climbing mother marries her off to a much older, emotional cold Duke played by Ralph Fiennes (who is, as he is in all of his roles, absolutely brillant). Georgiana weds before the age of 18 to a man she barely knows and clearly does not love, but she tries to be a good wife and mother, even going as far as to raise the Duke's illegitimate daughter as her own. She becomes a major star in the social scene of the time, with her unique style, wit, and beauty, and seems content to live separate lives with the Duke though still residing under one roof. All of this changes when the Duke chooses her best and only friend as his mistress and forces Georgiana to live with her as well. Georgiana then turns to her childhood sweetheart and falls deeply in love for the first time in her life. Of course, society being what it was (and is), the Duke does not allow her to keep her lover and forces her to make a heartbreaking choice between the love of her life and her children. This story is made all the more poignant knowing that her descendant the Princess of Wales would have to face a similar choice in our modern era of supposed equality.Some reviewers have said that the values and standards of the time will be seem alien to modern viewers. I greatly disagree. It has only in very recent years become the norm for women to choose their own mates based (hopefully) on love and not face becoming a complete outcaste if they divorce their husbands. In fact, in much of the Muslim world, arranged marriages are still the norm, and even in the West amongst certain religious groups (conservative Catholics being the main one), women are often trapped in loveless or even abusive marriages because divorce is such a taboo. We all know a woman who is ""sticking it out"" for the sake of her children, and I think that we all can relate to Georgiana's plight.

1213481,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001L57ZZG,Z Hayes,"[21, 24]","Having been a long-time fan of period dramas, I was eagerly anticipating the release of The Duchess on DVD [having had no time to go to the cinema], and watched it last night. I must say I was very impressed at the production quality of the movie and the overall acting caliber of the actors.Though the movie is based on a biography, Amanda Foreman's ""Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire"", my review is based on just the movie for I have yet to read the book. The movie basically portrays the life of Georgiana [Keira Knightley in one of her best roles to date], an 18th century aristocrat who at a very young age, not quite 18, is married off by her ambitious mother [a suitably icy performance by Charlotte Rampling] tothe Duke of Devonshire, William Cavendish [Ralph Fiennes in a remarkably controlled performance]. Though Georgiana's mother and the Duke enter into the marriage contract with the understanding that Georgiana's main role would be to provide William with a male heir, the girl herself naively believes [and is helped along by her calculating mother] that the Duke loves her.Georgiana's illusion of a marriage based on love is abruptly torn to shreds when she arrives at the Duke's palatial home - her 'induction' into the carnal aspects of marriage leave her feeling cold and unfulfilled, the Duke turns out to be a man who is emotionally distant and not given to sentimentality, and worst of all, he is also an adulterous cad, having affairs with lowly maids [right under Georgiana's nose] and even upper class ladies, one of whom is Georgiana's supposed best friend, Lady Bess Foster [Hayley Atwell].The menage a trois between the Duke, Duchess and Bess makes for compelling viewing in and of itself - though Georgiana insists Bess is thrown out of their home [Georgiana had initially asked Bess to live with them due to Bess' impoverished circumstances], the Duke refuses, and this gives rise to a very awkward living situation. The silent dining, the visitations by Bess' three sons [of whom she was initially denied access to by her estranged husband], and Georgiana's hurt at witnessing true affection between Bess and the Duke when she herself is deprived of love is heartrending to watch.Georgiana however, does find love - with Charles Grey [Dominic Cooper] who is a fast-rising politician. Their love is mutual and Georgiana finally finds in Charles a man who truly loves her for who she is.It was such a joy to witness their intimate scenes [not just the sexual part of it] for in these scenes, we truly see Georgiana come alive and her face is filled with the radiance of a woman fulfilled.The story of the Duchess of Devonshire is ultimately the story of a woman who lives in a gilded cage - her wealth doesn't shield her from the other pitfalls of life, namely of a loveless marriage and the confines her position places her in. Even in finding true love, she realises there is a high price to pay for dalliances, especially if one is a woman. In one of her confrontations with the Duke, Georgiana asks ""Why can't I have what you and Bess have?"" and this is a stark reminder that life as a woman back then was a life of repression and submissiveness.I felt the main actors did a fine job in their performances. Keira Knightley shines as the unhappy Duchess who goes from a carefree young girl in the opening scene to a fashion icon whose unhappy marriage becomes fodder for gossips and even plays, and who ultimately, in utter resignation, comes to accept the confines of her position and the practical realities of her marriage. Ralph Fiennes is simply amazing as the Duke, a man who is so emotionally-restrained, he comes across as ruthless and cruel, though he does reveal a capacity for empathy in some scenes. He is merely a product of his times and a man bound to duty more than anything else.All in all, ""The Duchess"" is an emotionally-wrenching human drama that will appeal to fans of period movies. It is filled with sumptuous costumes, lush depictions of the English countryside and a haunting score.
