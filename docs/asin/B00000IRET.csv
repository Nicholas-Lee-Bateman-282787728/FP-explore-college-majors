505115,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,B00000IRET,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[6, 6]","David and Lisa, the film they used to show on the late late show in the '70s, at least on New York TV, remains a moving timeless classic and features outstanding performances by Keir Dullea as David, Janet Margolin as Lisa, and Howard Da Silva as Dr. Alan Swinford.  Based on a novel by  Psychologist Theodore Isaac Rubin it follows David as he enters a school for disturbed teens.The filmaking is done in the European new wave black-and-white cinematic style of the time (though it's American).Dr. Swinford uses a humanistic approach, really the opposite of what mainstream psychiatry has become.  For him the solution is to open up one's feelings as opposed to making one oblivious with psychotropic drugs as is the norm today.Anyway we find that David is very intelligent though he has some severe phobias:  touch, death, etc.  He meets Lisa, someone with multiple personality disorder her alter-ego called Muriel.  The film turns into a love story between the two as they in effect end up curing each other.  Through it all the sixties feel shines through as well as the acting, directing, writing (Eleanor Perry), and cinematography talents.  Da Silva does a great job, and a great comeback role from the blacklisting period (due to the fascistic Robert Taylor). But again a rare excellence is attained by Dullea who went on to 2001 fame, and Janet Margolin.  Shot in Philadelphia the final scene was done at the Art Museum.  If I ever visit there it would be as a tribute to this film (not Rocky).So if you're into great '60s cinema check this (one of my faves) out...but by any means necessary avoid the worthless Oprah version.",5,1962 Poignant Classic and Frank Perry's Best,1189296000,"09 9, 2007",2007,1635,"['David', 'Lisa', 'film', 'used', 'show', 'late', 'late', 'show', ""'70s"", 'least', 'New', 'York', 'TV', 'moving', 'timeless', 'classic', 'features', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Keir', 'Dullea', 'David', 'Janet', 'Margolin', 'Lisa', 'Howard', 'Da', 'Silva', 'Dr.', 'Alan', 'Swinford', 'Based', 'novel', 'Psychologist', 'Theodore', 'Isaac', 'Rubin', 'David', 'school', 'disturbed', 'teens.The', 'filmaking', 'done', 'European', 'new', 'wave', 'black-and-white', 'cinematic', 'style', 'time', 'American', '.Dr', 'Swinford', 'humanistic', 'approach', 'really', 'opposite', 'what', 'mainstream', 'psychiatry', 'become', 'solution', 'open', 'up', 'one', 'feelings', 'opposed', 'making', 'one', 'oblivious', 'psychotropic', 'drugs', 'norm', 'today.Anyway', 'find', 'David', 'very', 'intelligent', 'severe', 'phobias', 'touch', 'death', 'etc', 'Lisa', 'someone', 'multiple', 'personality', 'disorder', 'alter-ego', 'called', 'Muriel', 'film', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'effect', 'end', 'up', 'curing', 'other', 'sixties', 'feel', 'shines', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'directing', 'writing', 'Eleanor', 'Perry', 'cinematography', 'talents', 'Da', 'Silva', 'great', 'job', 'great', 'comeback', 'role', 'blacklisting', 'period', 'due', 'fascistic', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'again', 'rare', 'excellence', 'attained', 'Dullea', 'who', 'went', '2001', 'fame', 'Janet', 'Margolin', 'Shot', 'Philadelphia', 'final', 'scene', 'was', 'done', 'Art', 'Museum', 'ever', 'visit', 'would', 'be', 'tribute', 'film', 'not', 'Rocky', '.So', ""'re"", 'great', ""'60s"", 'cinema', 'check', 'one', 'faves', 'out', 'means', 'necessary', 'avoid', 'worthless', 'Oprah', 'version']",N/A
505116,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00000IRET,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","It may feel a little dated, but `David and Lisa' has enough going for it to make it a welcomed cinematic experience.  Sure, some of the acting can appear over-the-top, some of the plot points can seem redundant and some of the films logic can seem out of date, but overall, for the time in which the film was made (early 60's) this is a genuinely good film that can still be enjoyed and should still be admired for what it accomplished.Before the likes of `One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest' became a cultural sensation, there was `David and Lisa', a small film about two mentally ill teenagers who form a strange yet pure bond, helping one another to break their mental barriers.  David Clemens comes to live at a boarding school of sorts for the mentally ill thanks to his fear of being touched.  His attitude puts off many around him, especially his fellow class-mates, but one girl in particular softens his character.  Lisa, a schizophrenic student (her other personality being Muriel), only talks in teasing rhyme, yet David connects with her and longs to help her.  When David's parents try and intervene (deeming his living arrangements unsatisfactory) David must take matters into his own hands to ensure his own recovery.The film is very nicely crafted and directed.  Frank Perry almost lends a Hitchcock feel to the film, glossing over each scene with a genuine feeling of fear and or eeriness.  I liked this aspect of the film, for to me it really embellished the truth behind mental illness.It's scary.The acting for me is actually pretty solid, with one major exception.  I did not care for Keir Dullea's performance, and quite frankly he was the most important player.  I felt that he was far too over the top in most of his scenes, which was only accentuated by Perry's attention to the dramatic.  Perry's style of directing would have benefited from a more subdued performance, a more lived in as apposed to lived out performance.  Dullea tried too hard to delivery showy, when he should have been working on delivering controlled and tense.  Janet Morgolin was astonishing as Lisa, truly understanding her characters duel personalities and the importance of never playing things too extreme.  Howard Da Silva was warm and effective, reminding me a lot of Robin Williams in `Good Will Hunting', and Neva Patterson was outstanding in her few short scenes.  She grasped the importance of acting even when you are not the focal point of a scene.  Her facial expressions never stopped working the camera and so she drew us to her.  I even thought that Richard McMurray worked magic with his one scene, completely compelling.The script was aces and deserving of the Oscar nomination is pulled in, and I'm tempted to say that Perry was deserving of that directing nomination, if only his lead actor had contributed to his directorial efforts.  Still, Dullea aside, this is a film one should see.  It's views on mental instability may be outdated and may turn some off, but when you take into consideration that this is a time capsule of sorts then you can appreciate the film for what it is.",4,"Not everything comes together properly, but it's still well worth your time...",1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2009,3099,"['may', 'feel', 'little', 'dated', 'David', 'Lisa', 'enough', 'going', 'make', 'welcomed', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'Sure', 'acting', 'can', 'appear', 'over-the-top', 'plot', 'points', 'can', 'seem', 'redundant', 'films', 'can', 'seem', 'date', 'overall', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'early', '60', 'genuinely', 'good', 'film', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'admired', 'what', 'accomplished.Before', 'likes', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoos', 'Nest', 'became', 'cultural', 'sensation', 'was', 'David', 'Lisa', 'small', 'film', 'two', 'mentally', 'ill', 'teenagers', 'who', 'form', 'strange', 'yet', 'pure', 'bond', 'helping', 'one', 'break', 'mental', 'barriers', 'David', 'Clemens', 'live', 'boarding', 'school', 'sorts', 'mentally', 'ill', 'thanks', 'fear', 'being', 'touched', 'attitude', 'off', 'many', 'especially', 'fellow', 'class-mates', 'one', 'girl', 'particular', 'softens', 'character', 'Lisa', 'schizophrenic', 'student', 'other', 'personality', 'being', 'Muriel', 'only', 'talks', 'teasing', 'rhyme', 'yet', 'David', 'connects', 'longs', 'help', 'When', 'David', 'parents', 'try', 'intervene', 'deeming', 'living', 'arrangements', 'unsatisfactory', 'David', 'must', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'ensure', 'own', 'recovery.The', 'film', 'very', 'nicely', 'crafted', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Perry', 'almost', 'Hitchcock', 'feel', 'film', 'glossing', 'scene', 'genuine', 'feeling', 'fear', 'eeriness', 'liked', 'aspect', 'film', 'really', 'embellished', 'truth', 'mental', 'illness.It', 'scary.The', 'acting', 'actually', 'pretty', 'solid', 'one', 'major', 'exception', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'Keir', 'Dullea', 'performance', 'quite', 'frankly', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'player', 'felt', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'top', 'most', 'scenes', 'was', 'only', 'accentuated', 'Perry', 'attention', 'dramatic', 'Perry', 'style', 'directing', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'more', 'subdued', 'performance', 'more', 'lived', 'as', 'apposed', 'lived', 'out', 'performance', 'Dullea', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'delivery', 'showy', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'delivering', 'controlled', 'tense', 'Janet', 'Morgolin', 'was', 'astonishing', 'Lisa', 'truly', 'understanding', 'characters', 'duel', 'personalities', 'importance', 'never', 'playing', 'things', 'too', 'extreme', 'Howard', 'Da', 'Silva', 'was', 'warm', 'effective', 'reminding', 'lot', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Neva', 'Patterson', 'was', 'outstanding', 'few', 'short', 'scenes', 'grasped', 'importance', 'acting', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'focal', 'point', 'scene', 'facial', 'expressions', 'never', 'stopped', 'working', 'camera', 'so', 'drew', 'even', 'thought', 'Richard', 'McMurray', 'worked', 'magic', 'one', 'scene', 'completely', 'compelling.The', 'script', 'was', 'aces', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'pulled', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'say', 'Perry', 'was', 'deserving', 'directing', 'nomination', 'only', 'lead', 'actor', 'had', 'contributed', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'Still', 'Dullea', 'aside', 'film', 'one', 'should', 'see', 'views', 'mental', 'instability', 'may', 'be', 'outdated', 'may', 'turn', 'off', 'when', 'take', 'consideration', 'time', 'capsule', 'sorts', 'then', 'can', 'appreciate', 'film', 'what']",N/A
505117,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B00000IRET,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[4, 5]","One of the earliest independent film successes in America, both in terms of box office and critical acclaim at international film festivals (including Oscar nominations for direction and screenplay), was director Frank Perry's issue oriented David And Lisa, produced by Paul M. Heller (My Left Foot), which was the first starring vehicle for two young actors of great potential whose careers eventually fizzled: Keir Dullea, who would reach his career apogee in Stanley Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Janet Margolin, who a year later would star as Woody Allen's wife in his directorial debut, Take The Money And Run. These days, Perry is most well known for his unwitting camp classic Mommie Dearest. But, back at the start of his career, Perry was what might be termed a social realist filmmaker who made several other films in that vein with his then wife, Eleanor Perry, who wrote the film's screenplay, adapted from the book, David And Lisa, by Dr. Theodore Isaac Rubin.While there have been any number of films dealing with mental illness and institutions (Harvey; John Cassavetes' A Child Is Waiting; One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest; Girl, Interrupted, to name the most memorable) few have been as well wrought as this- from the screenplay (remarkable in its prescience and sensitivity, given its year of release), to the acting, to the political commentary, to the 35 millimeter black and white cinematography, by Leonard Hirschfield, which renders many of the shots as sort of moving Ansel Adams photographs of cityscapes.... While Lisa clearly is the more disturbed of the two protagoists, neither youth would, today, be institutionalized, although they would likely be overmedicated since preschool, and given an assortment of irresponsible diagnoses, in this age of made up alphabet soup armchair maladies of autism for kids who are merely a little slow, or ADD (or ADHD) for kids who are a little hyperactive. David would be diagnosed as having Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), while Lisa seems to be suffering from some sort of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Her subtly lascivious and sexual touching of the statues in the museum, which echoes a brief scene of her fondling her own breast (albeit covered) after she realizes her attraction to David, clearly suggest sexual abuse, not true schizophrenia, nor anything worse. Thus, their reunion at film's end does not really suggest that love can conquer mental illness, but that it can help alleviate some of the problems that teenagers have faced since time immemorial, and which adults have often misconstrued. And, we have no reason to believe that David and Lisa will be released from the school anytime soon. Their admissions of love, without directly stating it, simply suggest that they have gotten over the worst in their lives, and can continue with their full recovery.Reputedly, the film was shot for about $185,000, but made over a million dollars in rentals after its 1999 release, by Fox Lorber, on VHS and DVD. Unfortunately, the DVD is rather standard. The only `extras' are some written filmographies of the three major characters, and director Perry. This film was also remade in 1998, by Oprah Winfrey, as a mawkish telefilm starring Sidney Poitier as the psychiatrist, and the execrable Lukas Haas as David. The original is better, and soap opera fans should note that Karen Lynn Gorney (then only fifteen), the original bad girl Tara on All My Children, and later to star in Saturday Night Fever, as Stephanie Mangano, plays the small role of Josette, another student at the school.All in all, this is a very good film, and one that without the advent of mass market DVDs would likely have had its negatives wither away in some vault. Instead, it can be seen not only as an important American film, historically, but one that entertains even as it enlightens, that rarest of artistic achievements.",3,Overlooked,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,3917,"['One', 'earliest', 'independent', 'film', 'successes', 'America', 'terms', 'box', 'office', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'international', 'film', 'festivals', 'including', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'direction', 'screenplay', 'was', 'director', 'Frank', 'Perry', 'issue', 'oriented', 'David', 'Lisa', 'produced', 'Paul', 'M.', 'Heller', 'Left', 'Foot', 'was', 'first', 'starring', 'vehicle', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'great', 'potential', 'careers', 'eventually', 'fizzled', 'Keir', 'Dullea', 'who', 'would', 'reach', 'career', 'apogee', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '1968', 'masterpiece', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Janet', 'Margolin', 'who', 'year', 'later', 'would', 'star', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'wife', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Take', 'Money', 'Run', 'days', 'Perry', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'unwitting', 'camp', 'classic', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'back', 'start', 'career', 'Perry', 'was', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'termed', 'social', 'realist', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'made', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'vein', 'then', 'wife', 'Eleanor', 'Perry', 'who', 'wrote', 'film', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'book', 'David', 'Lisa', 'Dr.', 'Theodore', 'Isaac', 'Rubin.While', 'have', 'been', 'number', 'films', 'dealing', 'mental', 'illness', 'institutions', 'Harvey', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'A', 'Child', 'Is', 'Waiting', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'name', 'most', 'memorable', 'few', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'well', 'wrought', 'this-', 'screenplay', 'remarkable', 'prescience', 'sensitivity', 'given', 'year', 'release', 'acting', 'political', 'commentary', '35', 'millimeter', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'Leonard', 'Hirschfield', 'many', 'shots', 'sort', 'moving', 'Ansel', 'Adams', 'photographs', 'cityscapes', 'Lisa', 'clearly', 'more', 'disturbed', 'two', 'protagoists', 'youth', 'would', 'today', 'be', 'institutionalized', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'overmedicated', 'preschool', 'given', 'assortment', 'irresponsible', 'diagnoses', 'age', 'made', 'up', 'alphabet', 'soup', 'armchair', 'maladies', 'autism', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'merely', 'little', 'slow', 'ADD', 'ADHD', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'little', 'hyperactive', 'David', 'would', 'be', 'diagnosed', 'having', 'Obsessive', 'Compulsive', 'Disorder', 'OCD', 'Lisa', 'be', 'suffering', 'sort', 'Post-Traumatic', 'Stress', 'Disorder', 'PTSD', 'subtly', 'lascivious', 'sexual', 'touching', 'statues', 'museum', 'brief', 'scene', 'fondling', 'own', 'breast', 'covered', 'attraction', 'David', 'clearly', 'suggest', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'not', 'true', 'schizophrenia', 'anything', 'worse', 'Thus', 'reunion', 'film', 'end', 'not', 'really', 'suggest', 'love', 'can', 'conquer', 'mental', 'illness', 'can', 'help', 'alleviate', 'problems', 'teenagers', 'have', 'faced', 'time', 'immemorial', 'adults', 'have', 'often', 'misconstrued', 'have', 'reason', 'believe', 'David', 'Lisa', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'school', 'anytime', 'soon', 'admissions', 'love', 'directly', 'stating', 'simply', 'suggest', 'have', 'gotten', 'worst', 'lives', 'can', 'continue', 'full', 'recovery.Reputedly', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'about', '185,000', 'made', 'over', 'million', 'dollars', 'rentals', '1999', 'release', 'Fox', 'Lorber', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'rather', 'standard', 'only', 'extras', 'are', 'written', 'filmographies', 'three', 'major', 'characters', 'director', 'Perry', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'remade', '1998', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'mawkish', 'telefilm', 'starring', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'psychiatrist', 'execrable', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'David', 'original', 'better', 'soap', 'opera', 'fans', 'should', 'note', 'Karen', 'Lynn', 'Gorney', 'then', 'only', 'fifteen', 'original', 'bad', 'girl', 'Tara', 'All', 'My', 'Children', 'later', 'star', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'Stephanie', 'Mangano', 'small', 'role', 'Josette', 'student', 'school.All', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'advent', 'mass', 'market', 'DVDs', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'had', 'negatives', 'wither', 'away', 'vault', 'Instead', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'not', 'only', 'important', 'American', 'film', 'historically', 'one', 'even', 'rarest', 'artistic', 'achievements']",N/A
505118,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B00000IRET,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","I first saw ""David and Lisa"" in the early 1960s and have watched it again at every opportunity. Set in a mental institution for youth, it is a most poignant story of bonding and love between two teens, Lisa (the late Janet Margolin), who has a schizoid disorder and can only speak in childish rhymes, and David (Keir Dullea), whose OCD manifests itself in an obsession with time, death, and germs. Margolin's performance is especially compelling, as she is gradually drawn out by David (the only person who truly communicates with her because he is willing to talk to her in rhymes). David, meanwhile, who at the beginning of the movie is a rigid, unemotional person (except when someone accidentally touches him, at which times he becomes extremely agitated), is humanized by his developing friendship with Lisa. The mutual development of David and Lisa is accomplished through a series of touching and winsome interactions.Because this movie was made more than 50 years ago it presents an outdated picture of mental illness as well as treatment. However, this is to be expected, given its age, and should not detract from the beauty of the story itself. The reality is that the bond of love that develops between David and Lisa is somehow purer and far less pretentious than that which is found between many ""normal"" people.Moreover, its portrayal of the prejudice that is displayed against the mentally ill (which we see in full force in the scene at the train station) is, sad to say, far from outdated. At the time ""David and Lisa"" was produced, it was a sorely needed reminder that those society deems abnormal are human beings every bit in need of love, affection, and acceptance as are the rest of us. This is a message still needed today.One final note: In 1998 there was a remake of ""David and Lisa,"" one touted by Oprah Winfrey. Do not make the mistake of buying the remake.
