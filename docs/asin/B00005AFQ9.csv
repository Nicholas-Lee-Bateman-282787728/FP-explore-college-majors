Caper movies are not scary: plan the heist, get the jewels, escape from the police, party.This movie will frighten you because Ben Kingsley plays a demonic sicko. (Really I want to use stronger language.) And he does it brilliantly. He says in the commentary that one of the young sassy actors was very respectful to him -- and to no one else in the cast.  But Ben, you have BECOME a world-class blood-thirsty psycho. Kingsley was so convincing, he convinced other actors.This movie has it all: a tropical paradise, romance, a twisted plot, a big heist, a nutjob thief.

576983,A3L2856DIMUXJY,B00005AFQ9,&#34;Belgo Geordie&#34;,"[2, 2]","I am a fan of Ray Winstone. But in this film it is two things which snatch the prize and throttle the life out of this just being another Brit crim flick. It is the character of Don Logan played by Ben Kingsley and the script. I am prone to sometimes compare pieces of cinematic dialogue to being Shakespearean. A lot of Kurosawa for example. Well, this is worth the comparison. Why, because the film pottles round until slow burn Kingsley starts to take off. Then, it appears there is no word not needed. In comedy with sheer psychopathic horror, it matches anything in Othello (Iago on steroids) or Richard III combined with the Krays. Winstone's role seems to be that of anchor to the terrifying force unleashed around him. In unlocking what might be termed evil in a human being Kingsley's portrayal of Don Logan is close and uncomfortable. There are laughs in this film and I laughed at some of the dialogue and interactions, but at what and on reflection what does it tell me about myself and my reactions and responses to horror/inhumanity, someone who is loathsome? At the end it left me scoured and wanting to read a copy of the script.

The dream sequences with the rabbit and Don Logan himself embody the subconscious fear and shame that people have. Don Logan is a walking metaphor for this subconscious fear - he is a man without inhibitions, strangely Tourettic: an Id personified. He forces people to confront their pasts and inferiority complex in a horrifyingly painful and gleeful manner. There's nothing else like it in my memory of other films. It's a crime that Kingsley didn't win the Oscar for the role of Don Logan. I don't recall ever seeing such a forthrightly menacing performance from anyone in movies.There's fine acting by everyone involved. The writing is superb - the dialogue is tough and crisp and poetically underwritten. The director Glazer understands well that tension is at its most unbearably taut point when the silence reaches its deepest, most awkward point. The nervous energy of suspense of some scenes in this film is awful and intense.The story of a main character Gal, a heistman who is hapless and in love, is touching. Through it all, it's his story of love that tempers the violence of the film. It's a great move on the writer's part to choose this character's story as the main through-line.The DVD feature with Kingsley and the producer's commentary is enlightening.

It joins the ranks of UK mob classics like 1971's GET CARTER w/ a mean Michael Caine and 1981's THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY w/ a meaner Bob Hoskins.  2001's SEXY BEAST has Ben Kingsley playing the meanest, baddest, most despicable ... mobster of them all, Don Logan.  Don heads to Spain to drag his old partner outta retirement to do 1 last heist back in London.  The great Ray Winstone memorably plays &quot;Gal&quot; Dove, the unlucky bloke trying to enjoy life in his Spain mansion.Man!  Kingsley gave me the creeps the moment the back of his bulging bald head 1st appears.  He is even scarier than Joe Pesci in GOODFELLAS.  The looks of Kingsley's Logan with bald head &amp; veins popping and goatee could make him pass for an older but supermenacing Stone Cold Steve Austin of the WWF!  Even the sight of Logan urinating on the rug (in Gal's villa!) gave me goosebumps.  He would kill Tony Soprano with his bloody stare!SEXY BEAST is MY Sopranos!  This is MY SCARFACE!  Give Ben who once played Gandhi an Oscar nomination.  Just give him the ... Oscar!  And Ray Winstone is sooooooooo terrific here.  He is on a roll after his other flicks NIL BY MOUTH &amp; THE WAR ZONE.  It was also great to see another fine Brit actor Ian McShane (remember LOVEJOY on cable's A&amp;E?) as a gay mobster w/ 1 sinister sm:)e.  I adore his all black business suits and sleek trenchcoat.SEXY BEAST is a job well done by music video director Jonathan Glazer who shows us 1 of the most bizarre (underwater) bank robberies I've ever seen.  I won't give much but don't you think Winstone and the robbers should've drained the Turkish bath pool that's next to the bank first?

None of thestars are attractive, well, except in this movie a localnative teenage boy who might have been a good choice forthe protagonist, since he tries in vain to comprehend whatis going on from time to time and even attempts to get ridof ""Don"", the Ben Kingsley character, when one has been wonderingfor some time why the others put up with his histrionics and bizarre behavior, especiallysince it has been clear that Don was an unwelcome houseguest from the beginning.""Don"", ominously affiliated with deranged associates, showsup trying to persuade the main character, an indolent retiredcriminal, to participate in a heist supposedly because hisexpertise is needed, even though ultimately the heist isexecuted so crudely that it seems obvious that no specialskills are required, other than looking bad in a Speedo(the heist is done from a pool in a Turkish bath next to the bankand involves a large gang of divers and swimmers,most of whom look like they could not carry it off).The praise heaped on Kingsley for this ""Tony Soprano""role is bewildering.  I guess he plays a criminal psychopretty well, but how hard is that?  A complex psycho,like the character played by Kevin Kline in ""Sophie'sChoice"" is one thing.  This character is cardboard,and he doesn't even dominate the action, such as it is,and most of that is pretty stupid.  What he does issplutter obscenities and illogical exhortations thatare so offensive that one again wonders why someonedoesn't decide to blow his brains out--or call the localcops--before the kid finally picks up a gun and appearsfrom nowhere.As some of the more perceptive reviewers have noted, thedialogue in this movie is all but unintelligible.  Themotivations of the characters are illogical---why wouldthe lead character, nicknamed ""Gal"", a retired criminal who wants to justenjoy life now with his wife, put up with ""Don Logan"",the Kingsley character, showing up at his villa in Spainand making a nuisance of himself?  When the kid finallyshows up with a gun and seems poised to kill Don, it makesno sense unless he has been privy to more than has appeared,and we wonder why he is the only one who takes charge.Given the story's setting, this might have been a promisingstudy of how expatriates attempt to plan a crime back inLondon and still manage to observe ""honor among thieves"",and there are some wasted ambiguities here and there,including for example the boy's relationship with ""Gal"".The opening scene is highly suggestive of some kind ofcomplexity there, perhaps even some kind of sexual relationship,and the boy-servant's loyalty andinstinctive sense of danger could well make sense and what'smore, offer an attractive character in the tradition of suchsensible and acute observers as Jim in Huckleberry Finn orKim in Kipling's novel.But that, or even having one or more of the women charactersin the movie show something more than a sullen resignation toher situation, might make for a character that one could identifywith or care about, and movies like this---and HBO's ""The Sopranos""--are determined to avoid such old-fashioned notionsof entertainment.",1,"Stupid unintelligible and boring, with some wasted chances",1099180800,"10 31, 2004",2004,3156,"['Why', 'anyone', 'kind', 'movie', 'None', 'thestars', 'are', 'attractive', 'well', 'movie', 'localnative', 'teenage', 'boy', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'choice', 'forthe', 'protagonist', 'vain', 'comprehend', 'whatis', 'going', 'time', 'time', 'even', 'attempts', 'get', 'ridof', 'Don', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'character', 'when', 'one', 'been', 'wonderingfor', 'time', 'why', 'others', 'put', 'up', 'histrionics', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'especiallysince', 'been', 'clear', 'Don', 'was', 'unwelcome', 'houseguest', 'beginning', 'Don', 'ominously', 'affiliated', 'deranged', 'associates', 'showsup', 'trying', 'persuade', 'main', 'character', 'indolent', 'retiredcriminal', 'participate', 'heist', 'supposedly', 'hisexpertise', 'needed', 'even', 'ultimately', 'heist', 'isexecuted', 'so', 'crudely', 'obvious', 'specialskills', 'are', 'required', 'other', 'looking', 'bad', 'Speedo', 'heist', 'done', 'pool', 'Turkish', 'bath', 'bankand', 'large', 'gang', 'divers', 'swimmers', 'most', 'whom', 'look', 'could', 'not', 'carry', 'off', '.The', 'praise', 'heaped', 'Kingsley', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'role', 'bewildering', 'guess', 'criminal', 'psychopretty', 'well', 'how', 'hard', 'complex', 'psycho', 'character', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Kline', ""Sophie'sChoice"", 'one', 'thing', 'character', 'cardboard', ""n't"", 'even', 'dominate', 'action', 'such', 'most', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'What', 'issplutter', 'obscenities', 'illogical', 'exhortations', 'thatare', 'so', 'offensive', 'one', 'again', 'wonders', 'why', 'someonedoes', ""n't"", 'decide', 'blow', 'brains', 'out', 'call', 'localcops', 'kid', 'finally', 'up', 'gun', 'appearsfrom', 'nowhere.As', 'more', 'perceptive', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'thedialogue', 'movie', 'unintelligible', 'Themotivations', 'characters', 'are', 'illogical', '-why', 'wouldthe', 'lead', 'character', 'nicknamed', 'Gal', 'retired', 'criminal', 'who', 'justenjoy', 'life', 'now', 'wife', 'put', 'up', 'Don', 'Logan', 'Kingsley', 'character', 'showing', 'up', 'villa', 'Spainand', 'making', 'nuisance', 'When', 'kid', 'up', 'gun', 'poised', 'kill', 'Don', 'sense', 'been', 'privy', 'more', 'appeared', 'wonder', 'why', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'charge.Given', 'story', 'setting', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'promisingstudy', 'how', 'expatriates', 'attempt', 'plan', 'crime', 'back', 'inLondon', 'still', 'manage', 'observe', 'honor', 'thieves', 'are', 'wasted', 'ambiguities', 'here', 'there', 'including', 'example', 'boy', 'relationship', 'Gal', '.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'highly', 'suggestive', 'kind', 'ofcomplexity', 'there', 'perhaps', 'even', 'kind', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'boy-servant', 'loyalty', 'andinstinctive', 'sense', 'danger', 'could', 'well', 'make', 'sense', ""what'smore"", 'offer', 'attractive', 'character', 'tradition', 'suchsensible', 'acute', 'observers', 'Jim', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn', 'orKim', 'Kipling', 'novel.But', 'even', 'having', 'one', 'more', 'women', 'charactersin', 'movie', 'show', 'something', 'more', 'sullen', 'resignation', 'toher', 'situation', 'might', 'make', 'character', 'one', 'could', 'identifywith', 'care', 'movies', '-and', 'HBO', 'Sopranos', 'are', 'determined', 'avoid', 'such', 'old-fashioned', 'notionsof', 'entertainment']",N/A

His domestic life in Spain has repressed his former rogueish self.  The latter is now relegated to creepy appearances in the sub-conscious (the beast?).Kingsley has quite a task in creating a character as fearsome and intimidating as Logan, especially without the help of any background information.  And he does a great job at it.  What plays out on the screen seems like an abstraction of an inner conflict between the protaginist's id (the beast) and his superego (Logan AND domestication).  This makes for a complex battle that offers no perfect solution, until, of course, love conquers evil..  what?!?!?!Well, at the beginning, love is injured symbollicaly by a giant boulder (earth's immoveable counterpart to Logan crashes into the pool and smashes the twin hearts on the floor).  Then the real boulder, Logan,  comes into the scene and forces out the Spanish boy (protaginist's inner child and ego) and pulls our hero back into the crime life. In London, we get to see some fancy heist-movie stuff (to satisfy the target audience of the marketers, I suppose) and learn a little more about what transpired back in Spain.  All the criminal characters are great, by the way.Once all the nasty business in London is taken care of, our protaginist (I don't usually use such language but I forgot the guy's name..)  returns to domestic life and repairs his love life, both figuratively and actually..  The hearts are repaired, and a nice surprise is waiting underneath (totally predictable, but a nice touch nevertheless).  The last scene with Ben Kingsley, however, is ridiculous, even though it offers a clever denouement to the subconsious battle suffered by the protaginist.  It seemed like something out of ""From Dusk Till Dawn.""If you like picking apart accents and clever dialogue, this movie is worthwhile.

576991,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005AFQ9,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","`Sexy Beast' is just that; it possesses a savage sexuality that rivets through the audience and draws them in, never letting go.  It's not your average gangster film.  It's smart and original and thrilling.  Couple the tight script with elegant direction and a marvelous cast, that includes two brilliant performances by the male leads (Kingsley and Winstone sizzle), and you have one of the finest films of 2001.  It's hard to find a single flaw within this breathtaking film; so why bother looking.  Let's focus on everything it has going for it.The film follows a retired British gangster, Gary `Gal' Dove, as he tries his hardest to resist the temptation to reenter the game.  He's visited at his home in Costa del Sol by notorious mobster Don Logan who forcefully attempts to persuade him to jump back in for one more heist.  Gal refuses but like I said, Don is very `forceful' in his persuasion.The greatest facet of this film is the pitting of Ray Winstone (who is quite the sexy beast if I do say so myself) and Ben Kingsley against one another.  Their masterful performances elevate this film into that `must-see/must-love' territory.  Winstone plays Gal with such emotional connection that you can feel his soul stripping as he contemplates the consequences of his actions.  I have been a fan of Winstone's for a while now and with each performance I fall deeper and deeper into his trance.  He says so much with his eyes, with his face; he becomes a canvas of unrelenting emotion.  Kingsley is the polar opposite of Winstone here, splicing the screen with ravaging brutality.  His character has been described as a pit-bull, and that is a very astute observation.  There is a scene where he converses with himself in the bathroom mirror; that scene alone is a spark of genius.Amanda Redman is flawless as Gal's wife Deedee and Ian McShane is marvelous as Teddy Bass.  They support the two powerhouse performances of their co-stars with fervor and grace.The film is magnificently constructed.  It's tight and smart and effective at what it's looking to do.  Jonathan Glazer knows what he's doing and delivers a near flawless film.  It is savage and brutal and elegant in all the right places.  It's sexy, it's provocative and it's a total beast.In the words of Gal himself; ""It's bloody hot!""",5,It's bloody hot...,1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,2302,"['Sexy', 'Beast', 'just', 'savage', 'sexuality', 'audience', 'draws', 'never', 'letting', 'go', 'not', 'average', 'gangster', 'film', 'smart', 'original', 'thrilling', 'Couple', 'tight', 'script', 'elegant', 'direction', 'marvelous', 'cast', 'two', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'male', 'Kingsley', 'Winstone', 'sizzle', 'have', 'one', 'finest', 'films', '2001', 'hard', 'find', 'single', 'flaw', 'breathtaking', 'film', 'why', 'bother', 'looking', 'Let', 'focus', 'everything', 'going', 'it.The', 'film', 'retired', 'British', 'gangster', 'Gary', 'Gal', 'Dove', 'hardest', 'resist', 'temptation', 'reenter', 'game', 'visited', 'home', 'Costa', 'del', 'Sol', 'notorious', 'mobster', 'Don', 'Logan', 'who', 'forcefully', 'persuade', 'jump', 'back', 'one', 'more', 'heist', 'Gal', 'said', 'Don', 'very', 'forceful', 'persuasion.The', 'greatest', 'facet', 'film', 'pitting', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'who', 'quite', 'sexy', 'do', 'say', 'so', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'one', 'masterful', 'performances', 'elevate', 'film', 'must-see/must-love', 'territory', 'Winstone', 'Gal', 'such', 'emotional', 'connection', 'can', 'feel', 'soul', 'stripping', 'consequences', 'actions', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Winstone', 'while', 'now', 'performance', 'fall', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'trance', 'so', 'much', 'eyes', 'face', 'canvas', 'unrelenting', 'emotion', 'Kingsley', 'polar', 'opposite', 'Winstone', 'here', 'splicing', 'screen', 'ravaging', 'brutality', 'character', 'been', 'described', 'pit-bull', 'very', 'astute', 'observation', 'scene', 'where', 'bathroom', 'mirror', 'scene', 'alone', 'spark', 'genius.Amanda', 'Redman', 'flawless', 'Gal', 'wife', 'Deedee', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'marvelous', 'Teddy', 'Bass', 'support', 'two', 'powerhouse', 'performances', 'co-stars', 'fervor', 'grace.The', 'film', 'magnificently', 'constructed', 'tight', 'smart', 'effective', 'what', 'looking', 'do', 'Jonathan', 'Glazer', 'what', 'doing', 'delivers', 'near', 'flawless', 'film', 'savage', 'brutal', 'elegant', 'right', 'places', 'sexy', 'provocative', 'total', 'beast.In', 'words', 'Gal', 'bloody', 'hot']",N/A

One mean little sob, Logan terrorizes his reluctant hosts and Kingsley is absolutely riveting and believable as this vicious rat-terrier of a man who will NOT take ""No"" for an answer.Ray Winstone is ""Gal"" Dove, a retired gangster living on the coast of Spain, accompanied by his wife and another retired hood & his wife.  Gal has become relaxed, tan and comfortable in his retirement villa, and the announcement that Logan has called and is on his way to Spain puts a pall of dread on everyone.Justified dread as it turns out, because Logan has come to pull Gal out of retirement to do a job with his old crew in London.  Gal wants none of it, but Logan is not going to be denied. Logan is the embodiment of the criminal's code that once ""in"" you can never get out.  He is ruthless & determined and Kingsley's performance is a tour-de-force.There is a heist, there is the ever present threat of violence and the violence itself, and other characters and complications I won't spoil by divulging.

If you enjoy the occasional foray into the dank, dark underbelly of grimy black comedy, however, this should be right up your alley.No plot spoilers here, but would say that there are certain parallels between what befalls the evil, soul-chomping antagonist, Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) and what eventually happens to the equally insensitive British mobster, Albert Spica (Michael Gambon) in Peter Greenaway's The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover. Kingsley is definitely the menacing lynchpin holding this movie together, though Ian McShane is not far behind him in his portrayal of a believably evil crime lord. Ray Winstone is an inspiration to middle-aged, beer-bellied Buddhas everywhere. Amanda Redman is a revelation as Gal's ex-porn star spouse. She plays the slow boil to perfection. Julian White is also superb playing the wife of Gal's slightly dim buddy, Aitch.Which brings us to one of the minor qualifiers I have to warn viewers about. Unless you've grown up in one of the grubbier, East End sections of London, a lot of the dialogue is going to be incomprehensible to you. This is particularly true of Aitch (Cavan Kendall, Kay Kendall's brother). I would definitely recommend the DVD, as opposed to the VHS purchase, as the DVD has a subtitle feature. I can honestly say I was lost without it, before I utilized the function. Kendall also mumbles his lines, as do several other characters. Mumbling and thick, cockney accents do not make for easy comprehension on the part of American viewers.This film has a workmanlike plot, with strong performances from all hands. It's great, gritty, black comedy. The funniest thing I've heard for a while is the statement made by Kingsley that he based his character of Don Logan on his grandmother. She must have been quite a lady! I've also discovered, via IMDB, that there may be a link between the guy in the bunny suit and the anti-Harvey in Donnie Darko.BEK",5,Not Exactly Noel Coward,1053993600,"05 27, 2003",2003,2022,"['Lovers', 'bright', 'airy', 'farcical', 'British', 'humor', 'are', 'apparently', 'not', 'Jonathan', 'Glazer', 'target', 'audience', 'enjoy', 'occasional', 'foray', 'dank', 'dark', 'underbelly', 'grimy', 'black', 'comedy', 'however', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'alley.No', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'here', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'certain', 'parallels', 'evil', 'soul-chomping', 'antagonist', 'Don', 'Logan', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'what', 'eventually', 'equally', 'insensitive', 'British', 'mobster', 'Albert', 'Spica', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'Cook', 'Thief', 'Wife', 'Lover', 'Kingsley', 'definitely', 'menacing', 'lynchpin', 'holding', 'movie', 'together', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'not', 'far', 'portrayal', 'believably', 'evil', 'crime', 'lord', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'inspiration', 'middle-aged', 'beer-bellied', 'Buddhas', 'everywhere', 'Amanda', 'Redman', 'revelation', 'Gal', 'ex-porn', 'star', 'spouse', 'slow', 'boil', 'perfection', 'Julian', 'White', 'also', 'superb', 'playing', 'wife', 'Gal', 'slightly', 'dim', 'buddy', 'Aitch.Which', 'one', 'minor', 'qualifiers', 'have', 'warn', 'viewers', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', 'one', 'grubbier', 'East', 'End', 'sections', 'London', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'going', 'be', 'incomprehensible', 'particularly', 'true', 'Aitch', 'Cavan', 'Kendall', 'Kay', 'Kendall', 'brother', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'opposed', 'VHS', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'subtitle', 'feature', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'was', 'lost', 'utilized', 'function', 'Kendall', 'also', 'lines', 'do', 'several', 'other', 'characters', 'Mumbling', 'thick', 'cockney', 'accents', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'easy', 'comprehension', 'part', 'American', 'viewers.This', 'film', 'workmanlike', 'plot', 'strong', 'performances', 'hands', 'great', 'gritty', 'black', 'comedy', 'funniest', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'while', 'statement', 'made', 'Kingsley', 'based', 'character', 'Don', 'Logan', 'grandmother', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'lady', ""'ve"", 'also', 'discovered', 'IMDB', 'may', 'be', 'link', 'guy', 'bunny', 'suit', 'anti-Harvey', 'Donnie', 'Darko.BEK']",N/A

SEXY BEAST is a fantastic but underrated indie classic. Like some of the other reviewers, I could watch this movie over and over again.Gal Dove (Ray Winstone) is a retired London mobster now living in Spain, going to fat in idyllic bliss with his former porn actress wife Dee Dee (Amanda Redman) and their best friends, a married couple they've known from when they were back in the life. Into their domestic paradise enters Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), another 'old friend,' showing up unannounced, telling Gal he has a job for him and ""No is not an answer.""Logan is one of those small wiry guys who make up for what they lack in height and muscle with an extra dose of psychotic meanness. Crime boss Teddy Bass (excellently played with menacing reticence by Ian McShane) is planning an ambitious heist on a prestigious bank, Logan is to help assemble the crew. Logan wants Gal in on the job and, as far as he's concerned, he's already made Gal's mind up for him. For Logan it is only a matter of how little stroking he will need to do before he strikes.In one scene, it's late and everyone is in bed, except Logan who is in the bathroom shaving. Standing in front of the mirror he starts thinking about Gal's refusal earlier in the evening. He begins muttering. Needing to relieve himself, he continues thinking and muttering as he urinates all over the floor. By now, having worked himself up into a rage, he runs out the bathroom with shaving cream still on his face, down the hall and, screaming ""No! No! No!"" storms into Gal and Dee Dee's bedroom kicking and punching the poor man out of his own bed.Another scene in the movie shows Logan sitting on a plane which will soon depart. Thinking nothing of consideration for fellow passengers, or rules and regulations, he lights up a cigarette. When one of the passengers mildly protests, Logan calmly but coldly informs the man that if he must put out the cigarette, he will be putting it out on him. When a flight attendant intervenes, Logan gets up, grabs his bag and --after telling all onboard he hopes the plane crashes and they all die-- demands to get off. After being removed and brought to airport security, Logan explains to the security officer the incident was all a case of nerves. He concocts a tale about a male flight attendant groping him while boarding! With a straight face, he tells the man that he felt violated and was literally in shock, not even realizing he was smoking a cigarette! Of course, he doesn't wish to make a fuss about any of it and would just like to leave and forget the whole thing.He walks out the airport, right into a taxi and back to making Gal's life hell. I couldn't stop laughing!Ben Kingsley does for SEXY BEAST what Joe Pesci did for GOODFELLAS. Both portray sociopaths, incapable of true consideration and comapassion.

When this happens to me in watching a film, I end up not caring what happens to the characters in it or even how it ends.  I would say that was my problem except that another UK gangster film, ""The Long Good Friday,"" could have had the same effect on me and, instead, I found it to be one of the most brilliant films I've ever seen. This film contains style to spare and its techniques and effects are terrific.  I'm specifically remembering any of the surreal sequences, including a surreal underwater love scene superimposed over the sky and another of a devil or demon in pursuit of the lead character in his nightmares. The movie would get an A if style were all.  Ben Kingsley does a great acting job as a career criminal, portraying a thoroughly detestable excuse for a human being.  His best scene is the one in the airport where he manages to turn his misbehavior aboard plane into a claim of his being sexually battered by airline personnel! The jist of the plot is that the Kingsley character must talk the lead character, played by Ray Winstone, into doing a heist of a bank vault. Kingsley's character lets loose with a torrent of abuse directed at Winstone and the people around him in order to achieve this end. One especially sensitive area that he uses is that Winstone's character is married to a former porn film star. I'd heard great things about this film but it did not live up to my expectations.

577007,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00005AFQ9,C. O. DeRiemer,"[4, 4]","This is a tough, hard movie about a retired safe cracker who is recruited for one last job. It also is funny and uncomfortable in equal measure, with excellent performances by Ray Winstone as the cracksman and Ian McShane as the man behind the job. Most of all, it has a mesmerizing and powerful performance by Ben Kingsley as Don Logan, all barely bottled resentment and anger as the muscle sent to recruit the Winstone character for the job.Gal Dove (Winstone) has retired from crime and now lives in a villa on the coast of Spain with his wife, who has also retired, in her case from the porn business. They're easy going working class people who just want to bake in the sun and swim in their pool. One morning while Gal is sunning himself, listening to music, a huge boulder shakes loose from the hill above him and comes rolling down toward him. He doesn't see it and doesn't hear it. It barely misses his head and crashes into the pool.A little later he learns that Teddy Bass (McShane) is sending Logan from London with an offer to buy into one last safe-cracking caper. Logan is more dangerous and lethal than the boulder would ever be. Logan sees everything as a possible affront or a deliberate insult. He's got half a screw loose. He can work himself into a rage in an instant. Just having a drink with him is nerve wracking. When Gal declines the offer, Logan's temperature rapidly starts going up. At one point, late at night while Gal and his wife are sound asleep, Logan wakes up to take a leak in his bathroom. He stands in front of the toilet, starts urinating and quickly talks himself into a rage. He deliberately moves so that he's peeing onto the floor. Then he charges into Gal's bedroom, wakes them up and is almost incoherent with what he seees as the insult of being turned down. It's sort of funny, but frightening. Kingsley gives one of the performances of his life. He is screwed so tight anything can set him off. His Don Logan is muscular, staring, almost rigid at times.Gal quickly sees that he must join the gang in London or there is no predicting what Logan would do to him...or to his wife and their two friends. The rest of the movie is basically the underwater break-in from a pool in a turkish bath to the vaults of the next door bank. Logan is dealt with satisfyingly, but only after it looks like he will kill a young pool boy at Gal's villa. Gal gets back to Spain by the skin of his teeth, because Bass may suspect what happened to Logan but he really doesn't care.Ray Winstone does a great job as the retired safe cracker. All he wants is peace and quiet and to enjoy the fruits of his labor with his wife and his friends. He's just a working class guy who does what he must, but who is a little shrewder than many would give him credit for. Ian McShane, on the other hand, does just as good a job, but his character is absolutely ruthless. He can be charming, with a smile that seems genuine. But the eyes are dead. You wouldn't want to cross him. He could turn Tony Soprano into hash.This is a satisfyingly brutal, funny and ironic movie.

Sporting brilliant performances by Oscar winner (and nominee for this film) Ben Kingsley as well as one of my favorite actors Ray Winstone (so amazing when he plays the vulnerable tough guy, refined and wounded none the less), this film is full of reasons to watch and love what you see.As gangster Don Logan, Kingsley is viscous and unrefined, charismatic, sarcastic and ferocious and that makes him all the more magnetic as he comes to single handedly force retired British gangster Gal (Winstone) to come back in for one more job.  When Gal refuses Logan is forced to change his mind.  The outcome is one I won't spoil but just say that this is a must see for any fan of gangster films, British films or anyone in the cast and is sure to be a memorable movie experience.Kingsley delivers as usual, and the raves he received were just as you can imagine, but it's Winstone (a true sexy beast) who really steals to show, to me at least, with his multi-layered performance that went completely overlooked by almost every critic, why I'll never know.

577013,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B00005AFQ9,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[2, 3]","Gary ""Gal"" Dove has found bliss in retirement; Nirvana in the sun-drenched blistering heat of the Costa Del Sol, Spain. His hillside villa is a billion miles away from his old life: safe-cracker and thug in gloomy old England.Within seconds of landing into the arid, teeming battleground of ""Sexy Beast"", we see Gal Dove (Ray Winstone, ying to Ben Kingsley's yang---see below) supine, 250 pounds of Yorkshire fat, happily simmered and broiled, and long-relaxed muscle, happily slack upon his lounger, baking by the pool.Happy. Reflective. Content.He lumbers up from his lounge-chair, snug in a Euro nad-hugger speedo (as only a happy man can carry off without shame), and starts to launch his portly bulk into the pool. Seconds before he does, a boulder, tumbling from the Andalusian heights, thunders inches away from him into the pool.That's what they call Foreshadowing.The boulder, of course, is the Emissary of the Devil, already on its way to Gal Dove's retreat. The Name of this particular Devil is Don Logan (Ben Kingsley, the very incarnation of Rage and the movie's black heart), and he does Hell a credit.Stop the tape a second. Don Logan shows up at Dove's Spanish villa, maybe hours after the boulder pays its respects to Gal's swimming pool.Logan is preceded by the Dread Black Spectre of his Reputation: everybody Dove knows---his wife and former porn star DeeDee (Amanda Redman), his hapless gin-drenched mate Harry (James Fox), Harry's wife Jackie Julianne White)---all of them know Logan. His wrath is legendary.Sometimes, God knows, it's hard to say ""no"" to Don Logan.Now: you see this flick for three reaons: 1) Ben Kingsley 2) Ben Kingsley 3) Ben Kingsley. When Kingsley's off the screen, frankly, you can turn off the DVD and go to sleep. Well, you'll wanna find out what happens, but Kingsley, one of the greatest actors of any age and doubly admirable, in my estimation, because he takes work whenever he can get it (from ""Gandhi"" to ""Species"", from ""Schindler's List"" to ""Bloodrayne""---some sneer, I respect)---Kingsley electrifies.He owns ""Sexy Beast"", consumes it, dominates it with his legend before he enters the picture, stuns, terrifies, brutalizes, bullies his way into sheer and complete hegemony over every living soul on or off the screen when he's in the picture. Don Logan rules, and Kingsley brings him to life: this skinny, wiry, muscular, tattooed, aggressively in-your-face bald, snapping, hyper-kinetic little creature of hate and hell and fury.He runs ""Sexy Beast"", he owns this movie: and---he demands---on the part of his crime boss---that Dove return to the world of crime and hate and potential prison time for ONE LAST HEIST.You've heard that before? Good. Dove doesn't wanna go. Who would blame him? He's happy, for once in his life, and he's relatively safe. I lived for a while in Andalusia; I knew men like Gal Dove. Dove drinks. He lounges. He soaks up rays. He's plump, flabby, soft. You think he can stand up to Logan, the very incarnation of the blood-soaked and hungry-for-more avatar of War?You'll see. What's the butcher's bill for Paradise?Anything more than that and I'll spoil your fun: suffice it to say that when Kingsley is on-screen, the flick is electric; absent the sneering, snapping Logan, and things drag a bit---but they're still intriguing, in a ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" kind of way. But Kingsley brings this sick little gutter masterpiece to life: he makes you flinch. He is brutal, possessive, dangerous, monstrous, insanely funny. I'd hire him, or buy him a drink, or mebbe even befriend him, but then I'm as much a monster as he is.Truth is, Kingsley is so good, so brutal, so crackling with cruel insane energy, that he basically chews up the flick: he's like a Black Hole, draining everything else white. But it would be wrong to say the other members of the cast don't hold up: they do, in spades. You'll see. Winstone, particularly, is good; stoic, steady, oddly pathetic and noble. Ian McShane, of course, turns in a role as a mafioso sleaze. Dove, Harry, and pool-boy Enrique (the impossibly glorious Alvaro Monje) go hunting a rabbit; that same rabbit---with a few modifications and a better arsenal---returns to Gal Dove in dreams.

The one doing the pulling is an absolutely ferocious Ben Kingsley, delivering a startling performance that appears to have taken everyone by surprise.  It's a pity that his memorable Don Logan doesn't appear in a movie that is worthy of him.Much of the first part of the film consists of Logan bullying Gal Dove, his wife (Amanda Redman), and friends (Cavan Kendall and Julianne White) in order to get Gal to agree to do the job.  Don disappears from the film, with no particular consequences for anyone.  The heist goes off in peremptory fashion, hardly seeming to be worth all of the build-up.  All through the film, I felt that director Jonathan Glazer and screenwriters Louis Mellis and David Scinto were setting me up for something surprising, but it never came off.

It is only the performances of Ben  Kingsley as Don Logan and Ray Winstone as Gal Dove that provided a significant reason to endure the experience.  Who chose the title of &quot;Sexy Beast?&quot; Rarely have  I ever encountered a less appropriate title for a movie concerning violent thugs.  Kingsley definitely wishes to stretch his acting talents and abandon the Ghandi  image.  He brilliantly plays an unforgettable vicious psychopathic monster.  Winstone is able to convey fear and unease without hardly saying a word.  This is an  actor possessing incredible skill.  Amanda Redman does a convincing job portraying Gal's loving and loyal wife DeeDee who enjoys their family life as retired and  affluent ex-thieves in beautiful Spain.The Logan character invites himself into their home and demands that Gal returns to England for one last robbery.  He will not take no for an answer, and places the  couple in an untenable position.  Ian McShane plays the role of Teddy Bass, the crime boss whose management skills are more than sufficient to encourage  cooperation between disparate individuals in order to achieve a common goal.  The vulgarity and violence are not for the squeamish.  Blood flows and guts are  splattered.  Those seeking an escapist story line should shun &quot;Sexy Beast.&quot;  The actual robbery is ludicrous, and would have little chance of succeeding in real life.  There are gaps of logic laced throughout &quot;Sexy Beast.&quot;  The film, though, does have its moments.  One can legitimately compare it to Quentin Tarantino's &quot;Pulp  Fiction.&quot;The British Isle accents are difficult to comprehend.  And yes, I will admit to wishing for subtitles (When will movie producers cease the nonsense of refusing to  provide subtitles to American audiences?

577020,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005AFQ9,D. Litton,"[4, 9]","Director Jonathan Glazer has created a beast alright, but not the one he had in mind. In fact, ""Sexy Beast"" may drive various viewers temporarily insane, as they may be prone to methods of self-punishment after sitting through 89 minutes of endless profanity, acting that, for the most part, is wasted on banal, lurid characters, and the unending sense that nothing of importance is going on in this dreamlike wasteland.The film stars Ray Winstone as Gal, a retired member of a closely-knit gangster ring who has relocated to Spain from England, away from his past and from edgy gangster Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), who, it appears, is coming to call once again. After a dinner party with friends turns sour when it is learned that Don wants Gal for one last job, things reach new levels of discomfort, especially when Don arrives and begins making his presence known to his timid hosts.As Gal, Winstone does indeed possess a quiet rebellion that grows deeper as he is physically and psychologically tormented by Don. It is Kingsley, however, who practically steals the show from his fellow cast members, exuding his authoritative figure in every scene just as he did in a far different manner in ""Gandhi."" He practically makes the movie, even if his talent goes to waste on a character who is as repulsive as he is demeaning.Aside from these two great performers, there's little else worthy of one's time in ""Sexy Beast."" Virgin-screenwriters Louis Mellis and David Scinto throw in completely unnecessary subplots, ranging from various dream sequences involving a beastly creature who stalks Gal, to a throwaway twist that involves Don's affair with Jackie (Julianne White), the wife of Gal's close friend, Aitch (Cavan Kendall). To what purpose does it advance the plot? Why should we care whether or not their lives are destroyed by such a revelation, given that we have had little time to get to know them?Director Glazer, whose previous track record is composed of television commercials and music videos, directs the film without grace, style, or a clear understanding of the plot itself. The first half of the film, that which is devoted to the game of wits between Gal and Don, raises a small hope for better things to come as the movie progresses; alas, we are given little more than a revenge/heist scenario that lacks impact or resonance it so desperately deserves.In short, ""Sexy Beast"" is a real beast of a movie that is neither sexy nor interesting, and chooses to substitute repetitive dialogue and abundant profanities for real conversation and plot development. Kingsley leaves a meager lasting impression, but odds are the film's rancid aftertaste will erase it from memory before you've had too much time to think it through.",2,A real beast of a movie that's neither sexy nor interesting.,1017014400,"03 25, 2002",2002,2742,"['Director', 'Jonathan', 'Glazer', 'created', 'beast', 'alright', 'not', 'one', 'had', 'mind', 'fact', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'may', 'drive', 'various', 'viewers', 'temporarily', 'insane', 'may', 'be', 'prone', 'methods', 'self-punishment', 'sitting', '89', 'minutes', 'endless', 'profanity', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'wasted', 'banal', 'lurid', 'characters', 'unending', 'sense', 'nothing', 'importance', 'going', 'dreamlike', 'wasteland.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Gal', 'retired', 'member', 'closely-knit', 'gangster', 'ring', 'who', 'relocated', 'Spain', 'England', 'away', 'past', 'edgy', 'gangster', 'Don', 'Logan', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'who', 'coming', 'call', 'once', 'again', 'dinner', 'party', 'friends', 'turns', 'sour', 'when', 'learned', 'Don', 'Gal', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'things', 'reach', 'new', 'levels', 'discomfort', 'especially', 'when', 'Don', 'making', 'presence', 'known', 'timid', 'hosts.As', 'Gal', 'Winstone', 'indeed', 'possess', 'quiet', 'rebellion', 'deeper', 'physically', 'psychologically', 'tormented', 'Don', 'Kingsley', 'however', 'who', 'practically', 'show', 'fellow', 'cast', 'members', 'exuding', 'authoritative', 'figure', 'scene', 'just', 'did', 'far', 'different', 'manner', 'Gandhi', 'practically', 'movie', 'even', 'talent', 'waste', 'character', 'who', 'as', 'repulsive', 'demeaning.Aside', 'two', 'great', 'performers', 'little', 'else', 'worthy', 'one', 'time', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'Virgin-screenwriters', 'Louis', 'Mellis', 'David', 'Scinto', 'throw', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'subplots', 'ranging', 'various', 'dream', 'sequences', 'involving', 'beastly', 'creature', 'who', 'Gal', 'throwaway', 'twist', 'Don', 'affair', 'Jackie', 'Julianne', 'White', 'wife', 'Gal', 'close', 'friend', 'Aitch', 'Cavan', 'Kendall', 'what', 'purpose', 'advance', 'plot', 'Why', 'should', 'care', 'not', 'lives', 'are', 'destroyed', 'such', 'revelation', 'given', 'have', 'had', 'little', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'Director', 'Glazer', 'previous', 'track', 'record', 'composed', 'television', 'commercials', 'music', 'videos', 'film', 'grace', 'style', 'clear', 'understanding', 'plot', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'devoted', 'game', 'wits', 'Gal', 'Don', 'small', 'hope', 'better', 'things', 'come', 'movie', 'alas', 'are', 'given', 'little', 'more', 'revenge/heist', 'scenario', 'impact', 'resonance', 'so', 'desperately', 'deserves.In', 'short', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'real', 'beast', 'movie', 'sexy', 'interesting', 'substitute', 'repetitive', 'dialogue', 'abundant', 'profanities', 'real', 'conversation', 'plot', 'development', 'Kingsley', 'meager', 'lasting', 'impression', 'odds', 'are', 'film', 'rancid', 'aftertaste', 'will', 'erase', 'memory', ""'ve"", 'had', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'think']",N/A
577021,A3BGLVC6OZM2JW,B00005AFQ9,"douglas barton ""emotions in motion""","[2, 4]","Expectations can lead to bitter disappointments. For over two years hearing friends and acquaintances bemoan the fact that I'd yet to view "" Sexy Beast "" and Ben Kingsley's Academy Award winning take as bilious and vengeful career criminal Don Logan I, at last, was able to fully digest ths marvelous picture. And though I may not share my friends complete enthusisasm for this movie I did find it completely engaging ( with reservations! )...though not completely satisfying.Obviously with Mr. Kingsley's role as the contemptible Mr. Logan the movie does rather revolve around a character that is neither completely fleshed out or indeed perhaps not even wholly worthy of all of this incredible word of mouth that it seems to have been awarded. Obviously Logan is a dark and disturbing ( and somewhat socially challenged ) character who pays the protagonist Gal ( lovingly underplayed by Ray Winstone ) a visit in an attempt to have him do one more job back in London for his old boss Teddy ( the ever sinister Ian McShane ). And while I found Kingsley's Don Logan to be just erratic and evil it sadly reached the point where I found him to be little more then an errant child in need of a good spanking as well. By giving Don so very much dialogue I found that, as time went by, his character became less a study of evil ( and far less threatening ) and more in a study of a lonely man who is seeking love  from a past flame and one who needs solace and empathy.  The scene on the airplane with Don heading back to London and subsequently thrown off due to his bad behavior seemed neither threatening or cruel. If anything it seemed rather contrived ( I've seen questioable behavior such as that myself while travelling ).  For this viewer Don Logan was simply far too accessible as to his insecurities ( hence his relationship with the ever attractive Jackie ) and on the screen far too much thus taking away some of the mystery as to why he was supposedly so intimidating. Mean-spirited yes but it seemed as though the film was trying far too hard to make him seem as though he was the epitomie of some dark and forboding presence. For me, after a while he was little more then a nuisance and I was glad to see our protagonist off to London to do the heist.That being said, I did find Ian McShane as Teddy the crime boss to be of a particularly dominating presence and the one role where you simply did not know what he was going to do next. At once he was not only deeply threatening but oddly devoid of possessing any true emotions. The scene with Teddy driving Gal back to the airport, for this viewer, was one that frightenly real simply because you never knew what Teddy might do, or say, next. For me, Ian McShane almost stole this film and without him the movie wouldn't carry half the weight that it does so well. To be completely honest I felt that Ian McShane could say more with just one look then Don Logan did in one of his tyrants that the films protagonists are subjected to. The role of Teddy was so forboding and oddly entrancing simply due to the fact that here was a man who, unlike our talkative Mr. Logan, didn't say much ( thus not giving away too much of his character ) but seemed to constantly be taking everything in and you half expected him to erupt in a blind rage at any moment. With a ruthlessness and sheer abandonment that no other character was capable off. And it was all imaginatively done with extreme subtlty and aplomb thus showing the viewer how terribly banal evil can at once be.Overall, this was a film that while I enjoyed very much but, as previously stated, with some reservations. The murder at the end of the movie seemed rather pointless, though it seemed to be thrown in for little more then for effect not because it helped along the story line. Though I did find the murder at the house in Spain to be particularly ruthless ( and graphic ) though necessary to the films emtional impact and was not only well done but perhaps was the most honest scene in the entire film. Overall, a interesting twist on in the gangster genre ( and dramatically more honest then what we see made over here in America ) and one which should be seen more then once. If nothing else to enjoy the final scene which comes as not so quite a shock but shows a sense of grisly humour that ends the movie on a high note.

If it was to the director and writer, I failed to see what this was supposed to bring to the film.  Also, the over used foul term that begins with c and ends with t was used more like it was a regularly used word.  Well, it is a very disgusting word, and I don't know why the writer chose this word.  It must be a very frequently spoken in England.  Also, I just think there is far too much swearing.  Do screenwriters really think that making the characters swear is going to make a film?The reason I started my review with this gripe is because this is what brought it down to just three stars. I thought it was a very entertaining, fast paced, in your face love story/heist/gangster movie, and I liked it.  It's original and daring and is bold.Ben Kingsley, who is playing perhaps the most evil I have ever seen him play, is outstanding!  What an actor!  Here is an actor who is so versatile, and his performance is so amazing.  I just can't believe the audacity of Don Logan, his character here.  This is one of the most menacing characters on film.  The dialogue that springs from his lips is truly mouth dropping and just down right shocking at times.Gal, played with great precision by Ray Winstone, is a just retired ""gangster""  and is asked by Logan to do a job.  Logan, is beastly and was once romantically linked to one of them women in the film. Gal is married to Deedee, a former porno actress.  She isn't the one from Logan's affair.  She is very happily married to Gal who totally seems to adore her.I will not give much more away about this film, but it is very much worth viewing to the viewer with an open mind.  There is some gore and graphic scenes that may be disturbing to some.However, it has a good plot that kept me watching to the end once I cued the dvd back up.

But I rate the film very highly independent of Kingsley, and something different that I liked about his performance.First, the entire story.  A retired gangster is trying to enjoy the good life.  The movie shows him as fat and lackadasical, but he wants it that way.  He feels he's earned his retirement, and this is exactly what he wants to do.  Nobody's going to pull him out of retirement for ""one last job"", which is why the big boys in London send the Kingsley character to do it.Kingsley's character is not even going to let you condsider thinking about refusing him.  He comes on as an extreme hard-ass from the first moment he's on screen, and never lets go.  If he says he's going to kill you for an insignificant offense, you don't doubt him for a minute.But what makes Kingsley's performance so special is that you realize how insecure the character is, and Kingsley lets this show.  A real pro could have instilled just as much fear in his prey in a much more subtle manner.  He's probably not got a long career as a criminal because he attracts too much attention to himself in public, a no-no in the mob.  As he's essentially a stupid, insecure, and even frightened character, his tactic is to blitzkrieg your senses before you have a chance to react.  He's not a great criminal, but a memorable one, and that's what I really like about it.The surrounding story tries to get a bit artsy, and works more than it doesn't.  The Ray Winstone character, even though he's retire, is plagued by his own demons.  You even get to see the demon, portrayed as kind of a werewolf, and it sticks with him throughout the movie.  The job he is called upon to do is shot very stylishly, but I would think the location they are trying to hit would have security devices that would have detected what they were trying to do.  And Ian McShane's performance as the boss who sends Kingsley to fetch Winstone is a perfect portrayal of cold, calculated evil.  It's how the Kingsley character SHOULD act, but not nearly as much fun to watch.See it.",5,Kingsley is more than meets the eye,1018915200,"04 16, 2002",2002,2149,"['Yes', 'just', 'everybody', 'who', 'movie', 'centers', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'performance', 'deservedly', 'so', 'rate', 'film', 'very', 'highly', 'independent', 'Kingsley', 'something', 'different', 'liked', 'performance.First', 'entire', 'story', 'retired', 'gangster', 'trying', 'enjoy', 'good', 'life', 'movie', 'fat', 'lackadasical', 'way', 'earned', 'retirement', 'exactly', 'what', 'do', 'Nobody', 'going', 'pull', 'retirement', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'why', 'big', 'boys', 'London', 'send', 'Kingsley', 'character', 'do', 'it.Kingsley', 'character', 'not', 'even', 'going', 'let', 'condsider', 'thinking', 'refusing', 'extreme', 'hard-ass', 'first', 'moment', 'screen', 'never', 'lets', 'go', 'going', 'kill', 'insignificant', 'offense', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'minute.But', 'what', 'Kingsley', 'performance', 'so', 'special', 'realize', 'how', 'insecure', 'character', 'Kingsley', 'show', 'real', 'pro', 'could', 'have', 'instilled', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'fear', 'prey', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'manner', 'probably', 'not', 'got', 'long', 'career', 'criminal', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'public', 'no-no', 'mob', 'essentially', 'stupid', 'insecure', 'even', 'frightened', 'character', 'tactic', 'blitzkrieg', 'senses', 'have', 'chance', 'react', 'not', 'great', 'criminal', 'memorable', 'one', 'what', 'really', 'it.The', 'surrounding', 'story', 'tries', 'get', 'bit', 'artsy', 'more', ""n't"", 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'character', 'even', 'retire', 'plagued', 'own', 'demons', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'demon', 'portrayed', 'kind', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'job', 'called', 'do', 'shot', 'very', 'stylishly', 'would', 'think', 'location', 'are', 'trying', 'hit', 'would', 'have', 'security', 'devices', 'would', 'have', 'detected', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'performance', 'boss', 'who', 'Kingsley', 'fetch', 'Winstone', 'perfect', 'portrayal', 'cold', 'calculated', 'evil', 'how', 'Kingsley', 'character', 'SHOULD', 'act', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'watch.See']",N/A

577028,AYKELBZM1SH87,B00005AFQ9,Erin O'Brien,"[3, 4]","""Sexy Beast"" opens on a scene of simple, Hockney-like geometry.  A square pool.  A horizontal white plinth of lounge chair.  A male body, roughly rectangular.  Many shades of blue.  The establishing shot marvels at a near-African sun.Two overlapping pink hearts, candy-shaped, feature in mosaic at the bottom of the perfect blue pool.  These are the kind of hearts that, like tiki torches and umbrella-laden drinks, suddenly look agreeable, even touching, and so deeply right in a tropical setting.  Totally tasteless and totally sincere.  No impoverished labourers created that mosaic, no: those hearts are made of pure love.The body looks edible, tenderized, like a slab of medium-rare steak.  The slicked-back hair is a glorious honey blond, striped with white.  The body is doughy and middle-aged but still lushly beautiful, tanned the ridiculous mahogany of vacationing Englishmen.  It is covered only with tiny yellow Speedo briefs.  The body can barely rouse itself to deliver a rapturous monologue on its pleasures.Sun, semi-nudity, solitude.  It's all right there on the surface.  A vision of calming hedonism, of gorgeousness in exile on the Costa del Sol. The souped-up reggae of ""Peaches"" by the Stranglers is a perfect, cheerily insinuating soundtrack.Gal Dove, retired Cockney gang member and burglar, is enjoying an eternal poolside junket in a world without melanoma.  Reflecting on a former life in England, he mutters: ""It's a dump.  Don't make me laugh.  What a toilet.""Gal clambers up from his white sun bed to appreciate his existence from a rare perspective of verticality.  Suddenly, a massive boulder rolls without explanation down a nearby hill, just clears Gal's shoulder, and crashes into the perfect square pool, filling it almost completely and breaking the two hearts.It feels all very Aesop's Fables, somehow.That night, news arrives of the immanent descent of criminal middleman Don Logan from London to this Spanish paradise.  Gal (Ray Winstone) lives with his beloved wife, former porn actress DeeDee, and two close friends from London, Aitch and Jackie.  All wilt with fear at the mention of Logan's name; his arrival for an overnight visit brings new meaning to the term home invasion.Logan is played by Ben Kingsley, best known in the title role of Richard Attenborough's ""Gandhi"".  Both the casting and the performance are shocking, and here Kingsley brilliantly and easily earns his Oscar nomination.Logan turns out to be a swami of ultra-violence, as spare as a shark: a rage-machine in a short-sleeved dress shirt and cheap flannel trousers. His bony, bumpy head, as he sits rigid in the back of a taxi, is bald, still.  He is given to paranoid dialogues with the mirror in the dead of night, winding himself up until he literally kicks Gal out of bed.  His speech is disturbingly speedy, and he has the habit of repeating the pigtails of sentences with brawling disbelief.Previous collaborations with Logan in high-line robbery have already earned Gal nine years in prison.  Logan, himself under pressure from decadent crime boss Teddy Bass, has come to recruit the unwilling Gal to empty the safety deposit boxes of a London bank, whose vault is billed as one of the most inaccessible in Europe.  (The planned entry is fittingly swank: eight thugs will tunnel through the pool of a Turkish bath adjacent to the bank, creating an underwater ballet of snorkelling and welding gear.)Gal's clean, spacious hacienda is instantly infused with claustrophobic tension and the atmosphere of domestic violence.  Logan's momentary kindness (shot through with homoerotic yearning, as in his confession to Gal: ""I love you.  You are loveable.  Big loveable bloke"") only wrong-foot the audience, making the next assault sting all the more.  ""Dove the love,"" rhapsodizes Logan.  ""Glamorous Gal, big Gal.  Gorgeous.  You used to have a great body, great physique.  Handsome.""  Logan pivots to invoke DeeDee's resume of old super-16 porn films: ""Dear me.  What a stain on your life.  All the Persil in the world couldn't shift it.  She's disgusting.""Don Logan won't take no for an answer.  ""Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,"" he screams.  Kingsley unleashes the black comedy in Logan's rage by playing him deadpan, implying Logan's ratty cunning, not Kingsley's irony.Gal is a bullyboy no longer.  He is touchingly devoted to his marriage and the simple pleasures of lounge lizardry.  He acts as a father-figure to the local pool-boy.  Appraising Gal's beefy, sun-blackened body, Logan hilariously spits out: ""You should be ashamed of yourself.  You look like f***ing Idi Amin.""Power is exerted through the criminal chain of command through sexual bullying.  Teddy Bass is offered a crack at the bank's vaults by a suavely nude bank president at an orgy they both attend.  Logan veers with terrifying arbitrariness from spasms of homophobia to hints at inconceivable violence.  ""That can all change,"" he threatens Jackie, remarking on her beauty.  ""You've got very nice eyes, DeeDee.  Never noticed them before.  They real?""Prior to Don's arrival, Gal and Aitch take the pool-boy shooting, and comically fail to bring down the tiny bunny in their sites.  Soon come dreams and hallucinations to haunt Gal featuring a giant, homicidal man-rabbit.  Staged by debut film director Jonathan Glazer, these arty interludes have proven virtually impossible for critics to assimilate, though they are as successful as they are ambitious.  Imagine Matthew Barney splicing the Manx iconography of ""Cremaster 4"" into a hybrid psychodrama-gangster film.  The gun-wielding man-rabbit first appears an emblem of Don Logan, then of Teddy Bass, but later seems to signify dread itself.Glazer finds a textured ensemble piece in a gangster film, and employs photography of exquisite quality.  His keen formalist instinct enables him to subtly refract audio-visual effect through Gal's first rapturous, later panicky perspective.  The verbal duels of Gal and Don are as captivating as a shoot-out, elevating what might have been a genre film to the status of art.",5,Trouble in Paradise,1053993600,"05 27, 2003",2003,6069,"['Sexy',

Without giving too much away there is en extended water sequence that I loved. The director also does great work with the actors and all work from a solid script that treats its characters like people, not charicatures.The story sticks to its intent and does not try to be all things to all people.Great cinematography and innovative execution of heist and I did not see it coming.Characters who you surprinsingly wind up caring about.Ben Kingsley's performance is fantastic, but a tad overrated because it differs from that which he gave in &quot;Gandhi.&quot; To me all the actors are just as good in their roles.CONS:The &quot;rabbit&quot; man. Please...... Talk about hitting the viewer over the head with a metaphor!!!Although the story is simple, it lacks a little punch and in my opinion loses much steam when it should really be picking it up.Although this can't be considered a true &quot;con&quot;, the accents are really hard to understand. The end effect for me is that it kept me watching more intently so more than a &quot;con&quot; it's more of a warning.Final Analysis: All in all and entertaining flick.

Of course, Sexy Beast isn't like that at all. It's a smart, funny, gritty and fast-paced movie that shows us the human side of the criminals. The plot is rather simple and the premise makes little sense (i.e. why exactly do they need this retired gangster to come all the way from Spain?), but it's transformed into a story that seems complex and interesting with some great dialogues and a clever editing job.The experience is further enhanced by the fantastic cast. Ben Kingsley's performance is getting rave reviews everywhere (and he is indeed very impressive in his Joe Pesci-esque turn), but it was Ray Winstone and his portrayal of the retired crim Gal Dove that really impressed me. Kingsley's role, while fun to watch, is rather clich&eacute; and not really the focal point of the story.

Very cute!  Which also happens to be the first lines of the film. I like the start of the film with the Englishman sunbathing.  He has a boy that helps him with the pool.  A boulder rolls down the hill, over the standing Englishman and into  his swimming pool.  The serenity changes when Don, played by Ben Kingsley comes to visit.  Polite at first, but moody.  When Don has a talk with Gal, he wants Gal to do a hitman's job.  Gal says he has ""retired"".  Gal will not do the job.  Don becomes erratic.  Once he hits Gal in the stomach.  At night, while Don is shaving, he begins taking to himself getting himself worked up.  Suddenly he walks into Gal's bedroom, who is sleeping with his love, and beats Gal while he slept.  Gal and Don have another talk.  Don still tries to pressure Gal into doing the hitman job.  Don finally leaves in a cab to the airport.  Don causes a problem on the flight because he wants to smoke his cigarette during take-off.  Later, he goes back to Gal's house with a vengeance.  Don is out of control.  Gal is hurt.  The boy points a rifle at Don.  Don talks him out of it and then hurts the boy.  Then Gal's love points a rifle at Don.  To find out what happens next you'll have to see the rest of this film.

Gal's settled into his relaxing, lazy days under the Spanish sun, until a boulder the size of a small house flies over his head and rolls into his treasured swimming pool. Can you say &quot;symbolic foreshadowing,&quot; boys and girls?...because Don Logan's about to slam into Gal's leisurely life with all the force and violence of a landslide, sent to recruit Gal out of retirement for one last heist, and absolutely NOT taking &quot;no&quot; for an answer .In a movie where much of the first half consists of conflict through dialogue (it's almost a stage play in set-up), the performances are key, and &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; has no weak links. Ray Winstone has the unenviable task of holding his own against Ben Kingsley, and succeeds uncannily without resorting to caricature. His fear is palpable--you can almost smell the sweat at his being cornered like a rabbit with no way to break out. Even perennial TV guest star Ian McShane excels in the role of a slick and cunning criminal boss, a performance that breaks out of his usual pattern and won't remind you in the least of Lovejoy (McShane's most famous character, the genial art forger/detective).But the standout performance is, of course, Ben Kingsley. Kingsley is brilliant as the manic, menacing Logan: fulfills the standard clich&eacute; of performing &quot;a role that will surprise you&quot;-Don Logan is sort of role Michael Caine made an icon in 1960s movies like the original &quot;Get Carter&quot;-tough, brutal, smooth, sexy, manipulative, and more than a little bit of a maniac: a man you don't say &quot;no&quot; to if you want to survive. The whole movie, in fact, has the feel of a 1960s British crime drama like &quot;Get Carter&quot; with the modern sensibilities of directors of today like Guy Ritchie. The movie may be a little too much a crime-genre film to garner Academy Award nominations, but both Kingsley's and Winstone's performances are worthy of an Oscar nod as a driven hunter and his prey.Although once it gets to the heist itself, innovative as it is, the main drive of the film is lessened. Once Kingsley's off the screen, I began fidgeting, waiting for his return, and McShane's character matching wits with Gal is no substitute for vicious Don Logan. But that's the sole weak spot in an exceptionally powerful, dark-humored, violent but stylish movie that's not so much a heist caper as it is a sharp and penetrating look at the violence men visit on each other...and on themselves.",5,Men would pull their own heads off rather than see Don Logan,1010707200,"01 11, 2002",2002,2731,"['line', 'Monty', 'Python', 'sketch', 'effect', 'criminal', 'underlings', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'men', 'pull', 'own', 'heads', 'rather', 'see', 'Doug.', 'quot', 'effect', 'news', 'Don', 'Logan', 'coming', 'town', 'retired', 'criminal', 'Gal', 'Gal', 'settled', 'relaxing', 'lazy', 'days', 'Spanish', 'sun', 'boulder', 'size', 'small', 'house', 'flies', 'head', 'treasured', 'swimming', 'pool', 'Can', 'say', 'quot', 'symbolic', 'foreshadowing', 'quot', 'boys', 'girls', 'Don', 'Logan', 'slam', 'Gal', 'leisurely', 'life', 'force', 'violence', 'landslide', 'sent', 'recruit', 'Gal', 'retirement', 'one', 'last', 'heist', 'absolutely', 'NOT', 'taking', 'quot', 'quot', 'answer', 'movie', 'where', 'much', 'first', 'half', 'conflict', 'dialogue', 'almost', 'stage', 'play', 'set-up', 'performances', 'are', 'key', 'quot', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'quot', 'weak', 'links', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'unenviable', 'task', 'holding', 'own', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'uncannily', 'resorting', 'caricature', 'fear', 'palpable', 'can', 'almost', 'smell', 'sweat', 'being', 'cornered', 'rabbit', 'way', 'break', 'out', 'Even', 'perennial', 'TV', 'guest', 'star', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'excels', 'role', 'slick', 'cunning', 'criminal', 'boss', 'performance', 'usual', 'pattern', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remind', 'least', 'Lovejoy', 'McShane', 'most', 'famous', 'character', 'genial', 'art', 'forger/detective', 'standout', 'performance', 'course', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Kingsley', 'brilliant', 'manic', 'menacing', 'Logan', 'standard', 'clich', 'eacute', 'performing', 'quot', 'role', 'will', 'surprise', 'quot', '-Don', 'Logan', 'sort', 'role', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'made', 'icon', '1960s', 'movies', 'original', 'quot', 'Get', 'Carter', 'quot', '-tough', 'brutal', 'sexy', 'manipulative', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'maniac', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'quot', 'quot', 'want', 'survive', 'whole', 'movie', 'fact', 'feel', '1960s', 'British', 'crime', 'drama', 'quot', 'Get', 'Carter', 'quot', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'directors', 'today', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'crime-genre', 'film', 'garner', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'Kingsley', 'Winstone', 'performances', 'are', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'driven', 'hunter', 'prey.Although', 'heist', 'innovative', 'main', 'drive', 'film', 'lessened', 'Once', 'Kingsley', 'off', 'screen', 'began', 'fidgeting', 'waiting', 'return', 'McShane', 'character', 'matching', 'wits', 'Gal', 'substitute', 'vicious', 'Don', 'Logan', 'sole', 'weak', 'spot', 'exceptionally', 'powerful', 'dark-humored', 'violent', 'stylish', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'heist', 'caper', 'sharp', 'penetrating', 'look', 'violence', 'men', 'visit', 'other']",N/A

He's about forty-five, a little bit overweight, living with his beautiful wife in a glamorous and sunny spanish villa. Then word reaches him a guy named Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) is looking for him for a final j ob. When we're introduced to Don Logan, he's not even on screen, but the faces the characters make when they're talking about Logan are enough to foresee what Logan's presence means. But in fact it's worse. Ben Kingsley, in an excellent performance, brings to life a raw, machine-gun-swearing, tactless person, a character created to bring rage even to eventual old-ladies who will watch the movie. Everything he does and says is directed to do harm to someone else. His job is to convince Gal to do this last job, but he's not going to have an easy time, brute or not.""Sexy beast"" is different from other movies of the genre, because its story concentrates not on the making of the ""final job"", but rather on the relationship of Don Logan with the other main characters, and that made the difference for me. Also, the fact that, except for Kingsley and James Fox, I knew none of the other actors, made the movie more believable. The funny thing is that Kingsley based the Logan character on his grandmother.Not a light entertainment, but no plot twists every five minutes either.

The Strangler's 'Peaches'- a song that is nothing short of gleeful lechery personified- slinks and oozes over the opening shots like the sweat on Ray Winstone's aging body. This movie is all about lust: Teddy's for making the ultimate robbery, Don's for Gal's return to corruption and for onetime lover Jackie, and Gal's to lead a relatively stress-free life with his wife and son in sunlight-saturated Spain.What keeps the plot from getting stale in this heist movie is that the heist itself is made secondary to the lead characters. More time and footage is spent examining Gal's 'new' and idyllic lifestyle and Don's fantatical need to have him come back to London for one last job while the robbery itself is condensed into a matter of  suspenseless minutes. That is not to say this movie isn't a nailbiter, there were several instances where I found myself recoiling in shock and clutching my face in surprise. Cutting down on the artificial elements involved in most British gang movies actually serves to create more real, and ultimately more horrifying moments by lulling you into a false sense of security.Ben Kingsley is a quivering bowstring of energy but often takes things close to, and sometimes completely, over the top and around the bend. Ray Winstone is phenomenal as Gal; you will have no doubt that this pudgily imperfect man was once a hardened criminal. Ian McShane manages to banish all comparisons to his Lovejoy character with his weathered skin, deadened eyes and 'involvement' (to put it politely) with a bisexual bank manager at an orgy. The accents are thick, but if you've picked this up chances are you've already tried one or both of Guy Ritchie's films (I refuse to recognize a certain remake starring a certain talentless pop star as his work) and your ears should be used to it.What keeps this just short of the five-star mark are some cheesy effects (including Kingsley's unabashed mugging) that pull you out of the movie's gritty reality.

But what sustains this very interesting film is its brutal energy and intensity.The cast is superb down to the smallest part.  The film concerns a retired mobster, Gal (Ray Winstone) who is dragged back into the game one more time by Don Logan (Kingsley), a mobster who is very much still in the game and who, similar to Don Corleone, makes Gal an offer that he can't refuse.The most interesting part of the movie is not the heist (although I enjoyed this part of the film), but the will-he, won't-he momentum leading up to it.  Just how convincing is Don Logan?  And does he win in all this?  The answer to the first question is VERY effective--Kingsley is a profanity-spewing, intensely coiled monster.  I won't answer the second--you'll just have to see it for yourself.This is a great, intense film (a first film, directed by a former music video director).  It's loud, brash and occasionally brutal, but there are also moments of quiet tenderness between Gal and his wife, a former porn star (who is thus berated by Logan).  It is, in short, a powerhouse of a film, well worth eight bucks.A couple of warnings--I had a very tough time understanding the Cockney dialect for the first ten minutes or so.

Along with the typically powerful McShane, and Winstone's nicely nuanced take on a hood trying to leave it all behind as he bakes in the Spanish sun, Sir Ben ratchets this one up a couple notches.The script and direction are both quite good, with some very nice camera work and a splashy, colorful palette. It gets rather nasty at times, but with some funny lines to leaven the tension it all plays out well, and in a crisp 87 minutes. Things pick up towards the end after a rather talky opening, and unless one can't take a large amount of f and c-bombs, plus occasional brutal violence, this is certainly worth watching.",4,Kingsley steals the show but Winstone and McShane are also excellent,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,780,"['very', 'modern', 'Brit-style', 'film', 'plenty', 'swearing', 'bluster', 'SB', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Kingsley', 'tight', 'little', 'turn', 'much-feared', 'London', 'gangster', 'typically', 'powerful', 'McShane', 'Winstone', 'nicely', 'nuanced', 'take', 'hood', 'trying', 'leave', 'Spanish', 'sun', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'one', 'up', 'couple', 'notches.The', 'script', 'direction', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'very', 'nice', 'camera', 'work', 'splashy', 'colorful', 'palette', 'rather', 'nasty', 'times', 'funny', 'lines', 'leaven', 'tension', 'out', 'well', 'crisp', '87', 'minutes', 'Things', 'pick', 'up', 'towards', 'end', 'rather', 'talky', 'opening', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'large', 'amount', 'f', 'c-bombs', 'occasional', 'brutal', 'violence', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

Bernabo,"[32, 35]","On the commentary track for ""Sexy Beast"" director Jonathan Glazer reduces the film to the level of a Greek myth wherein once upon a time there was a man who thought he was happy and the gods sent him the unhappiest man on earth.  It is the later figure, the gangster Don Logan, performed by Ben Kingsley in an Oscar nominated role, that dominates every moment on screen where he either appears or simply is being talked about, but the former, Ray Winstone as ""retired"" safecracker Gary ""Gal"" Dove, is a compelling, but much more subtle, character as well.  Gal is living the good live in his villa in Spain, sunning himself by the pool, when something happens that we soon understand is clearly a warning shot from the gods.  Gal is happy in his retirement, married to the woman he loves (Amanda Redman), who happens to be a former porn star.  Then word comes than Don is on his way with a offer that Gal intends to refuse.  However, nobody says ""no"" to Don Logan.The scenes between Gal and Don in this script by Louis Mellis and David Scinto strike me as what Harold Pinter would produce if he was writing about gangsters and went overboard on the profanity.  A conversation with Don is taking your life into your hands and Gal knows it, quietly dancing around the fatal rejection for as long as he can.  Kingsley's Don is one of the scariest men ever to appear in a film, although I am not sure how much of that has to be the sheer shock at the idea that it is ""Gandhi"" on the screen who is launching into foul-mouthed tirades and radiating danger with every look and action (all without ever having a gun in his hand, I should add).  This performance is astounding, and if it is unexpected that is only because we have taken Sir Ben for granted for a long time.  Kingsley lost the Best Supporting Actor Oscar to Jim Broadbent, who had an advantage with strong performances in ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""The Diary of Bridget Jones"" to go along with the one for which he won in ""Iris,"" but this is an unforgettable performance, assuming you get around to seeing the film.Kingsley's performance is so overwhelming that you may well fail to notice how strong Winstone is as the film's lead.  After all, it is Gal who is the title character, but Winstone's performance is so understated that it is can be rather underwhelming, especially in the face of Kingsley's performance.  The other thing that almost gets lost is the plot, because there is something that can be gotten if only there is the will, because the way will be right behind.  The caper is just crazy enough to make sense given the proceedings and we have to keep in mind that no matter how much of a mad dog Don Logan might be, there is somebody holding his leash at the other end.  ""Sexy Beast"" is a very good film with more than one outstanding performance, but it is not going to be to everyone's taste given the violence and the profanity, although both are true to the world of these characters.",5,Sometimes it is hard to say no.

577058,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005AFQ9,Lawyeraau,"[1, 1]","This is a strangely compelling film, made so by the riveting performance of Ben Kingsley, who plays vitriolic, psychotic, British gangster, Don Logan. With a pulse pounding, rat-a-tat-tat delivery of lines and with a totally sinister and utterly ruthless persona, Don Logan, spewing cockney accented venom, is about as frightening a gangster as one may imagine. It is no wonder that Kingsley was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance.The plot is simple. Retired thief, Gary ""Gal"" Dove (Ray Winstone), is living a relaxing, carefree life with his wife, DeeDee (Amanda Redman), an ex-porn star whom he clearly adores. With their ill gotten gains, they live in a beautiful, luxurious villa in Spain. They have a pool boy, Enrique, a local boy of whom they are clearly fond and who, it turns out, is fond of them. Former gangster, Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and his significant other, Jackie (Julianne White) also live in Spain. They all hang out together, living the good life. Their idyllic and carefree, expatriate lives are all shattered one day by the unwelcome intrusion of Don Logan, who comes to see Gal, as he wants to bring Gal out of retirement and back to England for one more heist. Don makes him an offer that, ultimately, due to a series of events, Gal finds that he cannot refuse.The film is really not so much about the heist itself, though it is an integral part of the film. It is really about love, and what one will do to protect those that one loves. While Kingsley's performance is a showstopper, Ray Winstone gives a notable performance as a teddy bearish kind of guy. He is a retired gangster who has gone soft and just wants to live the good life in peace with his wife and with the company of a few friends. He truly does not want to be involved in the heist. He just wants to get out from under. Amanda Redman give a strong performance as DeeDee, a woman who will stop at nothing to secure the sanctity of her home and the safety of those whom she loves. Ian McShane is appropriately menacing and single minded as the mob boss heading up the heist. The rest of the cast is also superlative, making this an excellent, though different, gangster flick.Be forewarned that the language employed by Don Logan in the film is absolutely filthy and offensive, and it is intended to be. So, if your sensibilities are easily offended, this is not the film for you. Moreover, the cockney accented delivery of lines was sometimes so fast, that I ended up watching the widescreen version with the English language subtitles on, so that I would not miss a thing.

Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.Beowulf is a very happy man. Retired in Spain after all his tribulations, financially comfortable (""I don't have much money - but enough"") he lives a carefree existence with a former porn star, now also retired ""but whose fan club still gathers every Friday evening"". His happiness is however greatly disturbed when his old pal Gandhi arrives. Gandhi is a vicious, violent, cruel, manipulative, oversexed, foul mouthed psychopath, haunted by demons called Ego, Attitude, Prejudice and Blasphemy. He has also horrible toilet manners.Gandhi is however only the messenger, send by Captain Blackbeard, a ferocious character who doesn's sail the seven seas anymore but rather haunts the upper class secret refuges. He is a non-nonsense guy, who puts his back (and significantly more) into his living, suffers no fool, carries no change, doesn't take no for an answer and NEVER leaves loose ends. He is currently preparing a daring criminal endeavour which involves indeed navigation, although mostly in brown water (pun very much intentional) rather than of oceanic nature. And he is calling Beowulf to him, to be part of his crew...Trapped between Gandhi and Captain Blackbeard, poor Beowulf will find himself in a pickle and it will be one hell of a ride to crawl out of it. In fact it is not even certain if he will be able to ever come back to his beloved Spain, join his old friends, sizzle near the renovated swimming pool and eat calamaris with his lascivious former porn star... It is in fact quite possible that Captain Blackbeard will have him walk the plank - after getting his bowels for garters...I liked this film a lot. All actors did a great job but even if Ray Winstone and Ian McShane are great it is Krishna Pandit Bhanji, a.k.a. Sir Ben Kingsley, who completely steals the show in this one - he is INCREDIBLE! Just a fair warning - the language used in this film is so strong that it can kill plants in your living room as surely as ""Agent Orange"". It certainly shocked my chipmunks - they didn't talk to me since we watched this movie (they can see the TV set from their cage).Bottom line - a great moment of cinema. To buy, watch and keep!

577062,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00005AFQ9,Michael Crane,"[5, 6]","When you think of ruthless and violent gangsters, you think of people like Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, Robert De Nero, and Michael Madsen (aka ""Mr. Blond).  The last person you'd ever think of pulling off such an act is Ben Kingsley.  Well, it only takes a minute or two to figure out that Kingsley can play one mean and frightening S.O.B. that could perhaps even make Joe Pesci soil himself and run home crying to Mommy.  ""Sexy Beast"" is a suspenseful, and even sometimes humorous gangster movie that is unlike any other.Gal used to be into the life of crime, but has ever since retired to the hot surroundings of Spain.  And, he is quite happy with his life.  That is, until Don Logan (Kingsley) decides to drop by and offer him a job.  Under normal circumstances, Gal would just say ""no"" and never look back, but Don Logan is NOT your normal circumstance.  He's a violent and hot-tempered man who doesn't like to take ""no"" for an answer.  Refusing the job from Logan could mean Gal sealing his own fate.This film was a complete surprise for me.  I had no idea what I was getting myself into and was in awe with what I was experiencing.  Ben Kingsley definitely steals the show and makes you feel cold all over with his chilling and brutal persona.  The film is not about numerous murders or killings; this movie relies more on dialogue and the psyches of its characters.  This film wouldn't be nearly as effective if it were non-stop violence galore.  Ben Kingsley is extremely frightening in his ""potential"" to do harm to others; such as Anthony Hopkins as the notorious ""Hannibal Lecter"" in ""Silence of the Lambs.""This film may not appeal to everybody; especially those who are looking for a non-stop action extravaganza.  ""Sexy Beast"" heavily relies on dialogue and character development than on anything else.  Do not go into this movie with the expectations of seeing another ""Casino"" or ""Goodfellas.""  This is a different type of beast (pardon the pun) in the gangster genera.  The movie is short, but it doesn't overstay its welcome and gives us exactly what we need.  We may be left with the feeling of wanting more, but the overall impression is that the movie does a great job of entertaining us for 90 minutes.The DVD has some cool extras to offer.  The picture and sound quality are not lacking in any way, shape or form.  Extras included are commentary by Kingsley and the producer, theatrical trailers, and a featurette.  While it might not be a ""fully-loaded"" DVD, it still has some entertaining features.  English Subtitles might be helpful for those who have a hard time getting used to the British accents of the characters.""Sexy Beast"" was a complete joy to watch.  It's wild, intense, and even funny at times.  While it may not appeal to everybody, I think it's something that should definitely be checked out by others.  If you have any doubts that Ben Kingsley can play a terrifying and violent mobster, well just have a seat and pop this baby into your DVD player.  A great movie experience with a high replay value.",4,"""You're gonna have to turn this opportunity yes!""(4.5 stars)",1071964800,"12 21, 2003",2003,3036,"['When', 'think', 'ruthless', 'violent', 'gangsters', 'think', 'people', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Robert', 'De', 'Nero', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Mr', 'Blond', 'last', 'person', ""'d"", 'ever', 'think', 'pulling', 'off', 'such', 'act', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Well', 'only', 'minute', 'two', 'figure', 'out', 'Kingsley', 'can', 'play', 'one', 'mean', 'frightening', 'S.O.B', 'could', 'perhaps', 'even', 'make', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'soil', 'run', 'home', 'crying', 'Mommy', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'suspenseful', 'even', 'sometimes', 'humorous', 'gangster', 'movie', 'other.Gal', 'used', 'be', 'life', 'crime', 'ever', 'retired', 'hot', 'surroundings', 'Spain', 'quite', 'happy', 'life', 'Don', 'Logan', 'Kingsley', 'drop', 'offer', 'job', 'normal', 'circumstances', 'Gal', 'would', 'just', 'say', 'never', 'look', 'back', 'Don', 'Logan', 'NOT', 'normal', 'circumstance', 'violent', 'hot-tempered', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'take', 'answer', 'Refusing', 'job', 'Logan', 'could', 'mean', 'Gal', 'sealing', 'own', 'fate.This', 'film', 'was', 'complete', 'surprise', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'was', 'awe', 'what', 'was', 'experiencing', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'definitely', 'show', 'feel', 'cold', 'chilling', 'brutal', 'persona', 'film', 'not', 'about', 'numerous', 'murders', 'killings', 'movie', 'more', 'dialogue', 'psyches', 'characters', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nearly', 'as', 'effective', 'were', 'non-stop', 'violence', 'galore', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'extremely', 'frightening', 'potential', 'do', 'harm', 'others', 'such', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'notorious', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'everybody', 'especially', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'non-stop', 'action', 'extravaganza', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'heavily', 'dialogue', 'character', 'development', 'anything', 'else', 'Do', 'not', 'go', 'movie', 'expectations', 'seeing', 'Casino', 'Goodfellas', 'different', 'type', 'beast', 'pun', 'gangster', 'genera', 'movie', 'short', ""n't"", 'overstay', 'welcome', 'exactly', 'what', 'need', 'may', 'be', 'left', 'feeling', 'wanting', 'more', 'overall', 'impression', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'entertaining', '90', 'minutes.The', 'DVD', 'cool', 'extras', 'offer', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'not', 'lacking', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'Extras', 'included', 'are', 'commentary', 'Kingsley', 'producer', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'featurette', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'fully-loaded', 'DVD', 'still', 'entertaining', 'features', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'might', 'be', 'helpful', 'who', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'used', 'British', 'accents', 'characters', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'was', 'complete', 'joy', 'watch', 'wild', 'intense', 'even', 'funny', 'times', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'everybody', 'think', 'something', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'checked', 'out', 'others', 'have', 'doubts', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'can', 'play', 'terrifying', 'violent', 'mobster', 'well', 'just', 'have', 'seat', 'pop', 'baby', 'DVD', 'player', 'great', 'movie', 'experience', 'high', 'replay', 'value']",N/A

Directed by Jonathan Glazer (a rising director of Guiness beer commercial fame), what makes this movie engrossing is the mentally (and sometimes physically) abusive relationship between retired criminal Gal (Ray Winstone) and the notorious Don Logan (Ben Kingsley).  The entire first act foreshadows what's to come, and the sense of fear and dread, balanced by an ever-diminishing feeling of whimsy, is almost tangible.This is a film that's worthwhile if only for the acting.  Ben Kingsley's role is quite a departure from the benevolent, fatherly figures he's played in 'Gandhi' and the more recent 'AI'.  He is, quite simply, stunning in this movie - he takes a character that everyone hates beyond words, who is so evil, crude, and determined, and makes him into one of the most powerful villains I've ever seen.  I can't remember the last time I *hated* a character so much (but in a good way).  Of course, Kingsley has a lot to play off with Ray Winstone's understated performance.  Winstone balances Kingsley's obnoxious character; he quietly wares through the mental torture his character must endure.  The cast of 'Sexy Beast' is incredible.This isn't a movie for everyone... there are some very dark and violent moments, some sincerely funny moments, and at times the movie is a bit bizarre.  I have to hand it to Jonathan Glazer, though, for making a movie that takes some artistic risks with an unconventional approach that, in my opinion, really pays off.",5,A British Anti-Heist Flick,995241600,"07 16, 2001",2001,1565,"[""'Sexy"", 'Beast', 'drama', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'matter', 'really', 'whole', 'lot', 'Directed', 'Jonathan', 'Glazer', 'rising', 'director', 'Guiness', 'beer', 'commercial', 'fame', 'what', 'movie', 'engrossing', 'mentally', 'sometimes', 'physically', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'retired', 'criminal', 'Gal', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'notorious', 'Don', 'Logan', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'entire', 'first', 'act', 'what', 'come', 'sense', 'fear', 'dread', 'balanced', 'ever-diminishing', 'feeling', 'whimsy', 'almost', 'tangible.This', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'only', 'acting', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'role', 'quite', 'departure', 'benevolent', 'fatherly', 'played', ""'Gandhi"", 'more', 'recent', ""'AI"", 'quite', 'simply', 'stunning', 'movie', 'character', 'everyone', 'words', 'who', 'so', 'evil', 'crude', 'determined', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'villains', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', '*hated*', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'way', 'course', 'Kingsley', 'lot', 'play', 'off', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'understated', 'performance', 'Winstone', 'Kingsley', 'obnoxious', 'character', 'quietly', 'mental', 'torture', 'character', 'must', 'endure', 'cast', ""'Sexy"", 'Beast', 'incredible.This', ""n't"", 'movie', 'everyone', 'are', 'very', 'dark', 'violent', 'moments', 'sincerely', 'funny', 'moments', 'times', 'movie', 'bit', 'bizarre', 'have', 'hand', 'Jonathan', 'Glazer', 'though', 'making', 'movie', 'artistic', 'risks', 'unconventional', 'approach', 'opinion', 'really', 'off']",N/A

Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 4]","Ben Browder, at a Farscape convention (yes, I am a huge geek), recently explained what makes a great actor:""The doctor's coming into a room.  But he's not there yet.  Actor #1 says: Get the doctor!  Actor #2 says: The doctor will save him! Actor #3 says: Here he comes! And we know without a doubt that the person who enters the room next is a doctor, and he hasn't spoken a single word.""Ben's point was that memorable characters are formed by interactions with other actors.  Which is why it's silly to give just one person kudos for a particular part, because all the actors who interact with that character help make that actor's character believable. And therein lies the beauty of Sexy Beast.Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) doesn't show up for the first half of the film.  What we see instead are the straw lives of four other people that hurricane Don will blow to pieces. There's Gary ""Gal"" Dove (Ray Winstone), a big shlub with a bad tan and tight swimming trunks. He is madly in love with his attractive wife, Deedee (Amanda Redman).  They seem to spend all their time hanging out by the pool, chatting about very little of substance, with another overly tanned chap named Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and his stunner of a wife Jackie (Julianne White).Until Don shows up.As it turns out, what we thought were just a couple of middle-class folks living the retiree life turn out to be washed up, worn out criminals and ex-porn stars.  And unfortunately for Gal, his life has finally caught up with him in the form of Don.Winstone and the rest do a fantastic job of exhibiting bone numbing, pee-in-your-pants fear.  They are nearly paralyzed by the thought of Don showing up and terrified of saying no to him.  Because of course Don wants poor Gal for one last job.  But Gal has good reason not to want to play along; he has enough money, a beautiful wife, and he was in prison for the last nine years.  His love of the sun, of the simple things, is understandable.Doesn't matter though.  Don is coming to town.When he finally shows up, Kingsley does an excellent job of making Don as horrible as we feared.  He's a psychopath of King Kong proportions; a snarling, spitting, peeing (yes, peeing) pit bull in human form that chomps on everything within reach.  The rest of the film follows the job itself, a dark tale of a crime boss (Teddy ""Black Magic"" Bass, played by Ian McShane) who wants to break into a vault to prove he's a better man.Sexy Beast's parallels to Donnie Darko, which came out the same year, are uncanny.  Both characters begin radical when a massive object (a boulder in Sexy Beast, an airplane engine in Donnie Darko) smashes into their lives.  And both characters have a deranged man-rabbit hinting at darker things to come.Oh, I'm sorry.  You didn't hear about the rabbit part?  A lot of reviews seem to skip it.Scattered throughout the film (three times, to be exact) are references to an uncredited, angry rabbit in human form.  He haunts Gal's nightmares.  He represents everything that Gal is and was, and could be.  It's telling that the rabbit-man only appears after Gal and Aitch try and fail to shoot a rabbit at point blank range.  Everything goes wrong...even the rifle falls apart.  Accompanying them on their hunting trip is their hired help, a young boy who remains mute for the entire film.  He's his own rabbit and it turns out he's one of the few people willing to stand up to the scary hunter.Indeed, if there's a moral in this film, it's that God favors the meek.  Sometimes it's because the strong don't think they're a threat.  Sometimes it's because the meek get lucky.  And sometimes, it's because the meek grab sticks and gang-beat the strong to death.A fantastic, tightly focused film that deftly wields profanity and terrified looks with the same measured approach.

577067,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B00005AFQ9,Mike Stone,"[3, 4]","I predicted that ""Sexy Beast"" would consist of 90 minutes of Ben Kingsley chasing Ray Winstone around a Spanish villa, yelling David Mametisms into his ear until one or the other of them ended up dead.  I was partially right (I won't give away which part I was right about, except that the Mamet allusion above was complimentary rather than critical).  Thankfully, that's not all this film has to offer.  A premise that could have ended up like the engrossing by messy ""Hurly Burly"" (i.e., a masturbatory film loaded with drunken ramblings and philosophical discussions on the endless minutiae of life) turned into something so much more.  That is, a finely tuned character study and a neat little suspense piece.Ben Kingsley justifiably gets most of the credit and press; it's a huge performance.  His Don Logan is a terribly showy part.  He's menacing, coiled like a cobra read to strike, busting veins from his forehead.  He's stark and rigid and frightening.  He's charismatic and literate.  He's childish.  He's supremely confident.  But in terms of actual screen time, the role is really nothing more than a supporting part.  It's the tune you'll be humming as you leave the theatre, but there's much more to the musical score.Ray Winstone as Gal is the one who puts the movie on his back and carries it from start to finish.  He is on screen in nearly every scene, and does a wonderfully understated job.  He's tanned to a crisp, paunchy, and nearly bleached blonde from his time in the Spanish nirvana.  But his anxiety is palpable when Don Logan shows up.  Winstone slouches, and shifts uneasily, generally showing his discomfort, while allowing the audience to feel it as well.  He does this remarkable thing with his eyes, where one squints tightly to show what used to be his power in his criminal days, while the other opens wide to show his fear.  It is a remarkable feat.  Winstone does yeomen's work shoring up the film's backbone.  It is a less showy role than the one Kingsley has, but ten times as important in terms of the overall film.The other actors aren't given much to do, except for Ian McShane as an intimidating bossman with a penchant for dressing in black.  Cavan Kendall as Aitch, a guest at Gal's villa, is so unintelligible with his thick Cockney accent that I can't decide if he was an interesting character or just a verbose blowhard.  He nearly ruined the movie's first half, as I had to focus all my energy to try and understand what he was saying.  Gal's wife Deedee was pleasant enough to look at, but she is really only given one scene in which to strut her stuff, and even then only briefly.  And her pregnant personal history is touched on lightly but left unexplored.Director Jonathan Glazer has a fine touch, employing showy style only when needed to bring the audience in to the anxiety that Gal is feeling.  He does a fine job showing the Spanish locations as idyllic, lingering briefly but significantly over his vast army of visual motifs, and juxtaposing images from Gal's dreamlife with his waking life.  And what a dream life it is.  Needless to say, I am still trying to sort out the relevance of the anthropomorphized hare that stalks Gal's subconscious with menacing glee.  Normally I'm not a fan of dream sequences in movies (there should be enough in the characters' waking lives to keep me interested) but these were so oddly appealing and perplexing that I'm glad Glazer gave them a go.  And they allowed for one of the oddest endings I've seen at the movies in a while.""Sexy Beast"" doesn't try to say too much, which is probably why it works so well.

577068,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005AFQ9,Miles D. Moore,"[6, 8]","There are two types of British thrillers: the genteel, Miss Marple-style ones, where murder and mayhem are discussed over tea and crumpets, and the ones which make Mike Hammer look like Miss Marple. &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; is emphatically of the second type. Stylish, brutal, blood-soaked and incredibly well-acted, &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; is a heist movie that has some trenchant, even profound, observations on the nature of good and evil, love and hate. Ben Kingsley--playing the role that in an American movie would go to either Dennis Hopper or Christopher Walken--has been getting the lion's share of the critics' attention, and indeed he is superb; he comes across as Satan incarnate, and an oversexed Satan at that. But to concentrate on Kingsley is to slight the outstanding contributions of Ian McShane--even more threatening than Kingsley in a much quieter role--or of Ray Winstone and Amanda Redman as central characters Gal and Dede. A retired thief and an ex-porn star, Gal and Dede are not tasteful, not eloquent, not refined, and yet their courage, devotion and capacity for love are the stuff of which England's greatest literature is made. As fine as &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; is, however, it left me with an &quot;Is that all there is?&quot; feeling. In the end, the story promised more than it delivered. But the acting alone makes &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; at least 850 times better than &quot;Snatch&quot; and other style-over-substance British crime flicks.",4,Makes Quentin Tarantino look like Merchant-Ivory.,994464000,"07 7, 2001",2001,1472,"['are', 'two', 'types', 'British', 'thrillers', 'genteel', 'Miss', 'Marple-style', 'ones', 'where', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'are', 'discussed', 'tea', 'crumpets', 'ones', 'make', 'Mike', 'Hammer', 'look', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'quot', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'quot', 'emphatically', 'second', 'type', 'Stylish', 'brutal', 'blood-soaked', 'incredibly', 'well-acted', 'quot', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'quot', 'heist', 'movie', 'trenchant', 'even', 'profound', 'observations', 'nature', 'good', 'evil', 'love', 'hate', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'playing', 'role', 'American', 'movie', 'would', 'go', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'been', 'getting', 'lion', 'share', 'critics', 'attention', 'indeed', 'superb', 'Satan', 'incarnate', 'oversexed', 'Satan', 'concentrate', 'Kingsley', 'slight', 'outstanding', 'contributions', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'even', 'more', 'threatening', 'Kingsley', 'much', 'quieter', 'role', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Amanda', 'Redman', 'central', 'characters', 'Gal', 'Dede', 'A', 'retired', 'thief', 'ex-porn', 'star', 'Gal', 'Dede', 'are', 'not', 'tasteful', 'not', 'eloquent', 'not', 'refined', 'yet', 'courage', 'devotion', 'capacity', 'love', 'are', 'stuff', 'England', 'greatest', 'literature', 'made', 'As', 'fine', 'quot', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'quot', 'however', 'left', 'quot', 'quot', 'feeling', 'end', 'story', 'promised', 'more', 'delivered', 'acting', 'alone', 'quot', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'quot', 'least', '850', 'times', 'better', 'quot', 'Snatch', 'quot', 'other', 'style-over-substance', 'British', 'crime', 'flicks']",N/A

I have watched this several times finding new things about it each time.  Ben Kingsley's performance is riveting, and, as someone said earlier, is so different from the parts he usually plays.  His performance as the rage filled mobster, Don with his obsession with getting the retired mobster, ""Gal"" to do ""one more job"" and the things he does and says to ""persuade"" him are like a series of hammer blows.The other surprising performance, at least to me, is that of Ian McShane as mob boss, Teddie Bass, the Prince of Darkness.  After seeing McShane's Teddy in action, I wouldn't have wanted to go back to London and tell him ""Gal"" said ""no"" either.  I have been familiar with McShane's work for the past forty years.  He has always been a very capable actor delivering good performances consistently  However, he always played light comedic roles.  I was very surprised when he was chosen to play another Prince of Darkness, Swearningen in HBO's ""Deadwood.  I wonder if it might have been this performance as Teddie which caused him to be chosen for the Deadwood role.Ray Winstone gives his usual excellent performance as the retired safe cracker, afraid of the damage Don can do to his family and friends if he refuses to join the ""job"" but not wanting to do the one more job which could land him in prison long enough for it to be a life sentence.The story is intriguing; the performances are amazing.  This is a must see movie for all noir mystery fans.I saw the bunny character as the Devil, and Don in Hell, mean enough to give even Satan a run for his money.

577074,A3UA40JOD3BE1M,B00005AFQ9,"Paul Fogarty ""Hopeless film addict!""","[4, 4]","These words, ""I won't let you be happy, why should I?"" are spoken by ""Don Logan,"" homicidal, sociopathic enforcer for London Mob boss ""Teddy Bass,"" AKA, ""The Man With The Plan."" Logan is the central protagonist in ""Sexy Beast,"" to ""Gary 'Gal' Dove,"" a comfortably retired blagger - bank robber - living in Spain with his wife, and ex-porn star, ""Deedee."" When not hanging 'round the pool of their villa, Gal and Deedee spend time in bars and restaurants with another couple, ""Aitch"" - as in the letter ""H"" - and ""Jackie."" Aitch is another ex-blagger spending his twilight years soaking up the Spanish sun and living the good life... such as it is.Gal may be an ex-criminal, a safecracker by specialty, but he's paid the price for one job too many, done his time inside, and he's good people. You can see that by the way he jokes around with the couples pool boy, ""ordering"" him to clean-up the place while he, Gal, lays around on his lounger, bemoaning the current state of ""Dear Old Blighty"" and its people, in a somewhat forthright, expletive laden manner! LOL!The plot of Sexy Beast is as brutally straightforward as is its protagonists. Bass has worked out how to knock-off the most lucrative, most secure vault in London, outside of the Bank of England, and he wants - doesn't necessarily ""need"" mind you, but for his own reasons wants - Gal in on the job. Gal, as we know, is retired, unfortunately for him he's definitely wanted, and Don is dispatched to bring him back... one way or another.The first time we hear about Don is when Gal, Deedee, Aitch, and Jackie, sitting in their favorite restaurant, discuss the phone call Jackie received from London letting her know he'd be flying out to see them shortly. Like ""Kaiser Soeze"" inThe Usual Suspects, Don is a character of fearsome, almost mythic reputation, but unlike Soeze, there's no doubting the existence of Don; a real-life bogeyman, monster, psychopath, capable of acts of the most extreme violence in return for little or no provocation. As the foursome sit 'round their table, appetites suddenly gone, their hushed and plainly frightened tones tell us all we really need to know about Don Logan.Next we see Logan being driven out to Gal's villa from the airport by Aitch and Jackie. They ride in silence, Don looks out the window at the passing countryside with the dead, emotionless eyes of a shark; Aitch and Jackie make sure they give Don no reason to talk to them. They pull up outside the villa, Gal nervously comes out to greet his unwelcome visitor, but Don is not happy, he doesn't like the heat, he's sweating, and he announces his displeasure to those present with a stream of profanity laced invective that would make a drunken sailor blush! (I watched this with a friend a while back, and his reaction to this scene was classic, the shocked look on his face said it all; ""WHAT?!?!?! This is the guy who won an Oscar playingGandhi?!?!?!"" LOL!)The film has a wonderful ensemble cast, but is dominated, and rightly so, by Ben Kingsley's terrifying, murderously savage portrayal of Don Logan, perfectly described in the Amazon Editorial above as, ""human nitroglycerine;"" everyone around him avoids making eye contact, as if he was a rabid dog. Ray Winston, as Gal, gives another one of his seemingly effortless performances of an ordinary bloke - no saint, but not ""bad"" either - who you'd buy a pint for if you met him down the pub. And a special mention must go to Ian MacShane as the mobster Bass, all hooded reptilian eyes and blank face, who's act of coldly executed murder towards the end of the film is just as shocking as Logan's frequent outbursts of hysterical violence. Kudos also to Amanda Redmond as DeeDee, Cavan Kendal as Aitch, and Julianne White as Jackie.Sexy Beast comes from a long line of venerable British gangster films such as Michael Caine's originalGet Carter, and the incendiary debut of Bob Hoskins inThe Long Good Friday. So be warned, there's a rawness, and an in-your-face brutality about the film that you don't find in most US movies, especially in the script, the one exception I can think of at the moment is the NC17 version ofBad Lieutenant. (Also, American viewers may want to switch on the subtitles at least initially, 'til your ears become accustomed to the strong Cockney accents! LOL!)

I went in knowing very little about Sexy Beast except I was a little intrigued  about it having caught the tail end of the Ebert and Roper review.  They were commenting about how scary Ben Kingsley was as Don Logan and that even the back of his neck was scary. Suffice it to say a shaved head, big arm tattoos and a goatee with downturned moustache helps create a tough guy image and it works on Ben Kingsley too.  However I think this is not a good reason to see the movie.  Kingsley did a fine job, however its hard not to take in his diminutive stature and too tight slacks which made him slightly comical.  I dislike coming down on this film because it was not shot with a big budget. There were sound problems making the thick accents off the lesser characters difficult to understand at times. But mostly I felt there were some odd choices made that prevented a strong emotional bond with the &quot;good guys&quot; in the film.  The family and friends are largely left to express themselves in somber looks and very little dialog.  This works effectively in the opening scenes when it is announced Don Logan will be arriving on a plane the next day.  The distress is palpable. However affection and family bonds are hard to read.  The main character pretty much has to tell us verbally he loves his wife and the neighbor loves his wife.  Their relationships look rather gray and non communicative. When they do communicate it feels like they are not reaching one another at all. This is a bleek move for a film in the comedy genre...even a black comedy.  The heist which is the focal point of the film should have been very interesting. While unique it  suffered from a lack of set up and choreography to let you know what steps were involved so that there was some tension being created and so you could know when goals were achieved so you could celebrate a little.  The whys and wherefores of this break-in in which water plays an important part were taken for granted and left the whole segment feeling unnecessarily flat. For myself, the comedy was a little too dry and the drama a little too light to say I really enjoyed Sexy Beast.  It was often entertaining to be sure.

And this is because I am used to the American accent.  Nothing against British accents at all, but I just have trouble understanding them when spoken too quickly and in lower tones.  I had no problem understanding Kingsley though, cause he was always yelling... or talking in a menacingly slower voice, as he does on the airplane (great scene).2)  What was that dream sequence crap?  I immediately thought of Donnie Darko and the rabbit/man thing that showed up throughout that film.  There was no purpose for it here.3)  And the job that the main character didn't want to do...

577086,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005AFQ9,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","Ben Kingsley delivers a bone-chilling performance as the man everyone loves to hate, a role for which he earned not only universal critical acclaim but a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination as well.  Don Logan is so evil that even his fellow mobster buddies fear and hate him.  From our very first glimpse of him high-strutting his way through an airport terminal, Kingsley hits just the right note for his character.  Cleverly, writers Louis Mellis and David Scinto have paved the way for this entrance by introducing Logan ahead of time in a series of conversations in which just the mere mention of his name sets off portentous reverberations amongst the people discussing him.Chief among those people is the film's protagonist, Gal, Logan's ""retired"" ex-partner in crime, who wants nothing more than to be allowed to enjoy life undisturbed in his seaside Spanish villa with his swimming pool and the wife he loves so dearly.  But Gal soon discovers that a person cannot escape his past forever, when Logan suddenly shows up at his doorstep demanding that Gal join his own personally hand-picked gang of seasoned criminals whom Logan has brought together to pull off a major heist back in Merry Olde England.  Gal would like nothing better than to send Logan home packing empty handed, but he also knows that defying Logan can be the fastest route to an early demise.  It is this atmosphere of fear and dread that director Jonathon Glazer uses to make ""Sexy Beast"" such an engrossing and off beat little crime drama.In fact it is the THREAT of violence, far more than the violence itself, which distinguishes this tale.  Without the use of weapons of any kind, Logan is able to cow and terrorize a roomful of reasonably fearless adults simply by his steely-eyed demeanor and the unpredictable nature of his temperament.  Seemingly controlled and rational one moment, he can suddenly erupt into a volcano of exploding anger the next.  One of the most chilling moments in the film occurs aboard a departing airplane in which Logan refuses to douse his cigarette, thereby precipitating a confrontation with the flight crew.  Logan has that quality that distinguishes all great villains:  he throws us back on our heels by his refusal to conform to the social amenities that the rest of us simply take for granted and which put us at a decided disadvantage when faced with the evil characters of the world who know no rules and flagrantly disregard the ones we follow.  He reminds us of how weak and vulnerable the rest of us really are.Logan, for all the intensity generated by his character, is not, however, the focal point of the film.  Gal, brilliantly played by Ray Winstone, who provides a fascinating counterpoint to Logan's no-holds-barred villainy, occupies that position.  Despite his criminal background, Gal wins us over by his openhearted frankness, his sincere devotion to his wife, friends and neighbors, and his obvious desire to lead a straight life from hereon out.  Winstone underplays his scenes superbly, yet he never allows himself to be acted off the screen by the fiery Kingsley.  (One should mention that the heavy accents of the characters make what they are saying a bit incomprehensible attimes).As is not uncommon in gangster movies these days, Glazer manages to inject an element of black humor into the proceedings.  The comedy often takes the form of twisted surrealism, such as when a giant boulder rolls down a nearby hillside and lands plop in Gal's beloved pool, barely missing taking Gal to the bottom with it.  The filmmakers also have an effective way of heightening the tension through indirection, particularly in the early scenes which prime us to dread Logan's entrance as much as the characters who don't want to see him - and we haven't even met him yet.  This technique of telegraphing information ahead of time contributes immensely to heightening the suspenseful quality of the film.""Sexy Beast"" provides superb performances, a nasty sense of humor and a fascinating glimpse into the dark side of human nature.",3,"strong performances, interesting drama",1027641600,"07 26, 2002",2002,4061,"['Ben', 'Kingsley', 'bone-chilling', 'performance', 'man', 'everyone', 'hate', 'role', 'earned', 'not', 'only', 'universal', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'as', 'well', 'Don', 'Logan', 'so', 'evil', 'even', 'fellow', 'mobster', 'buddies', 'fear', 'hate', 'very', 'first', 'glimpse', 'high-strutting', 'way', 'airport', 'terminal', 'Kingsley', 'just', 'right', 'note', 'character', 'Cleverly', 'writers', 'Louis', 'Mellis', 'David', 'Scinto', 'have', 'paved', 'way', 'entrance', 'introducing', 'Logan', 'ahead', 'time', 'series', 'conversations', 'just', 'mere', 'mention', 'name', 'off', 'portentous', 'reverberations', 'amongst', 'people', 'discussing', 'him.Chief', 'people', 'film', 'protagonist', 'Gal', 'Logan', 'retired', 'ex-partner', 'crime', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'allowed', 'enjoy', 'life', 'undisturbed', 'seaside', 'Spanish', 'villa', 'swimming', 'pool', 'wife', 'so', 'dearly', 'Gal', 'soon', 'person', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'past', 'forever', 'when', 'Logan', 'suddenly', 'up', 'doorstep', 'demanding', 'Gal', 'join', 'own', 'personally', 'hand-picked', 'gang', 'seasoned', 'criminals', 'whom', 'Logan', 'brought', 'together', 'pull', 'off', 'major', 'heist', 'back', 'Merry', 'Olde', 'England', 'Gal', 'would', 'like', 'nothing', 'better', 'send', 'Logan', 'home', 'packing', 'empty', 'handed', 'also', 'defying', 'Logan', 'can', 'be', 'fastest', 'route', 'early', 'demise', 'atmosphere', 'fear', 'dread', 'director', 'Jonathon', 'Glazer', 'make', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'such', 'engrossing', 'beat', 'little', 'crime', 'drama.In', 'fact', 'THREAT', 'violence', 'far', 'more', 'violence', 'tale', 'use', 'weapons', 'kind', 'Logan', 'able', 'cow', 'terrorize', 'roomful', 'reasonably', 'fearless', 'adults', 'simply', 'steely-eyed', 'demeanor', 'unpredictable', 'nature', 'temperament', 'Seemingly', 'controlled', 'rational', 'one', 'moment', 'can', 'suddenly', 'erupt', 'volcano', 'exploding', 'next', 'One', 'most', 'chilling', 'moments', 'film', 'departing', 'airplane', 'Logan', 'douse', 'cigarette', 'thereby', 'precipitating', 'confrontation', 'flight', 'crew', 'Logan', 'quality', 'great', 'villains', 'back', 'heels', 'refusal', 'conform', 'social', 'amenities', 'rest', 'simply', 'take', 'granted', 'put', 'decided', 'disadvantage', 'when', 'faced', 'evil', 'characters', 'world', 'who', 'know', 'rules', 'flagrantly', 'disregard', 'ones', 'follow', 'how', 'weak', 'vulnerable', 'rest', 'really', 'are.Logan', 'intensity', 'generated', 'character', 'not', 'however', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'Gal', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'who', 'fascinating', 'counterpoint', 'Logan', 'no-holds-barred', 'villainy', 'position', 'criminal', 'background', 'Gal', 'over', 'openhearted', 'frankness', 'sincere', 'devotion', 'wife', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'obvious', 'desire', 'lead', 'straight', 'life', 'hereon', 'out', 'Winstone', 'scenes', 'superbly', 'yet', 'never', 'be', 'acted', 'screen', 'fiery', 'Kingsley', 'One', 'should', 'mention', 'heavy', 'accents', 'characters', 'make', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'bit', 'incomprehensible', 'attimes', '.As', 'not', 'uncommon', 'gangster', 'movies', 'days', 'Glazer', 'inject', 'element', 'black', 'humor', 'proceedings', 'comedy', 'often', 'form', 'twisted', 'surrealism', 'such', 'when', 'giant', 'boulder', 'rolls', 'down', 'nearby', 'hillside', 'plop', 'Gal', 'beloved', 'pool', 'barely', 'missing', 'taking', 'Gal', 'bottom', 'filmmakers', 'also', 'have', 'effective', 'way', 'heightening', 'tension', 'indirection', 'particularly', 'early', 'scenes', 'prime', 'dread', 'Logan', 'entrance', 'as', 'much', 'characters', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'met', 'yet', 'technique', 'telegraphing', 'information', 'ahead', 'time', 'contributes', 'immensely', 'heightening', 'suspenseful', 'quality', 'film', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'superb', 'performances', 'nasty', 'sense', 'humor', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'nature']",N/A

Just as the old TV Dragnet series had its distinctive beat, and just as Roger Miller's songs had their own England Swings Like a Pendulum Do fractured meter - so ""Sexy Beast"" rides along on a kind of poetry slam staccato.

""Simply Fabadocious.""This is only the second movie I can remember seeing in which a wealthy couple lives in pure, harmless delight in their wealth. (The other movie was ""Six Degrees of Separation."") In most other movies, the wealthy are automatically depicted as being either unhappy, villainous, or both. But here we have people we immediately like. And when Ben Kingsley darkens their door, threatening to destroy their lives, we root for them to be able to maintain their happy, reveling existence.It's not completely clear how the Kingsley character can wield such power over people, causing them to quake at the mere mention of his name. However Kingsley does create plausible menace with his driving intensity. He ups the volume of negative vibe with his pounding, punctuated, ""No, No, No!""It's Ian McShane though who is the most truly menacing character here. The dark, raw threat of brutality about him creates almost overwhelming tension at some points. One might ordinarily expect that he would be ""the sexy beast"" of the movie, rather than Kingsley.However, it is the nature of this film to be syncopated throughout. None of its stressed beats fall quite where you expect them to fall.Overall, this is a quirky, sometimes very violent, memorable film.

Don is clearly winning the battle but the ex-gangster is heroically not caving in till the very end where a nice surprise ending is in store as the last big job takes place.Kingsley's performance is nothing short of unforgettable. He puts new dimensiions in the genre of cinematic psychos.

Gal is perfectly content to lay out and bake in the sun all day. Gal is a retired thief and is not happy to hear that an old acquaintance, Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), is traveling from London to convince him to help out with a 'job'. Upon his arrival, Don turns heaven into hell. Gal and DeeDee have to deal with the problem.""Sexy Beast"", the new British film from first-time director Jonathan Glazer, is a promising debut. The director, reportedly one of the most sought after commercial directors, has a cinematic eye and composes very interesting shots. He does not fall into the trap of other former commercial-directors-turned-film-directors. He doesn't edit the film excessively. Scenes play out as they probably would in real life. He allows us to get to know the characters and to see what they are doing, gives us time to get into their skin. This is very helpful and effective. During the opening scenes, of Gal sunbathing, I could feel my skin heating up.Glazer does fall into a trap that is very common. He composes some shots in a way calculated to make them look interesting or pretty, forcing them to appear unnatural. uy Ritchie does this a lot, but his films have the feel of a cartoon and it becomes a part of the film. Glazer does some strange things with point of view which serve to pull the viewer out of the film. We see the action from the POV of a car door as it is closed, we see the action from the POV of a revolving door in a hotel as it turns, etc. POV is a tricky thing and needs to seem as though it is actually coming from someone. In these shots, no one is at this level, so the shots appear unnatural.Also, Glazer provides too many literal images. The audience is smart and it is more effective to leave things to the imagination. A critical plot point happens near the end of the second act. Just as it is about to happen, Glazer cuts away to a new scene in London. I was very surprised. The scene was very effective, leaving the consequences of the action, the consequences that we didn't see to my imagination. I was thinking that some very bad things happened. However, the remainder of this scene is intercut with parts of the next. I no longer needed to imagine anything as everything was portrayed for me. Not as effective.Kingsley and Winstone are the best things about the film. Kingsley is electrifying. Everything about Don is menacing. From the moment he fist appears, we get the image of a lifelong thief, a tough guy. Then Kingsley builds upon this, creating one of the most menacing characters I have seen in a long time. Every word out of his mouth is meant to hurt and harm, to cause damage.Winstone is just the opposite. Gal is a former gangster, and we get that immediately from his character, but he i very determined to live a new life. He has a wife, whom he obviously loves dearly, and he is very happy. Don threatens this life, but he manages to maintain his cool and stick by his guns. He has a quiet, steely resolve which proves very effective throughout the film.""Sexy Beast"" is far from a great film, but there is enough going on to keep people interested and entertained. It also makes me eagerly anticipate Glazer's next film. Perhaps he will learn from his mistakes and create something very memorable.",4,Sexy and Memorable,1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,3370,"['Gal', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'DeeDee', 'Amanda', 'Redman', 'are', 'living', 'quiet', 'tranquil', 'life', 'retirement', 'Spain', 'Gal', 'perfectly', 'content', 'lay', 'out', 'bake', 'sun', 'day', 'Gal', 'retired', 'thief', 'not', 'happy', 'hear', 'old', 'acquaintance', 'Don', 'Logan', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'traveling', 'London', 'convince', 'help', 'out', ""'job"", 'arrival', 'Don', 'heaven', 'hell', 'Gal', 'DeeDee', 'have', 'deal', 'problem', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'new', 'British', 'film', 'first-time', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Glazer', 'promising', 'debut', 'director', 'reportedly', 'one', 'most', 'sought', 'commercial', 'directors', 'cinematic', 'eye', 'composes', 'very', 'interesting', 'shots', 'not', 'fall', 'trap', 'other', 'former', 'commercial-directors-turned-film-directors', ""n't"", 'edit', 'film', 'excessively', 'Scenes', 'play', 'out', 'probably', 'would', 'real', 'life', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'see', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'time', 'get', 'skin', 'very', 'helpful', 'effective', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Gal', 'sunbathing', 'could', 'feel', 'skin', 'heating', 'up.Glazer', 'fall', 'trap', 'very', 'common', 'shots', 'way', 'calculated', 'make', 'look', 'interesting', 'pretty', 'forcing', 'appear', 'unnatural', 'uy', 'Ritchie', 'lot', 'films', 'have', 'feel', 'cartoon', 'part', 'film', 'Glazer', 'strange', 'things', 'point', 'view', 'serve', 'pull', 'viewer', 'film', 'see', 'action', 'POV', 'car', 'door', 'closed', 'see', 'action', 'POV', 'revolving', 'door', 'hotel', 'etc', 'POV', 'tricky', 'thing', 'needs', 'seem', 'actually', 'coming', 'someone', 'shots', 'one', 'level', 'shots', 'appear', 'unnatural.Also', 'Glazer', 'too', 'many', 'literal', 'images', 'audience', 'smart', 'more', 'effective', 'leave', 'things', 'imagination', 'critical', 'plot', 'point', 'end', 'second', 'act', 'Just', 'happen', 'Glazer', 'away', 'new', 'scene', 'London', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'scene', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'leaving', 'consequences', 'action', 'consequences', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'imagination', 'was', 'thinking', 'very', 'bad', 'things', 'happened', 'However', 'remainder', 'scene', 'intercut', 'parts', 'next', 'no', 'longer', 'needed', 'imagine', 'anything', 'everything', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Not', 'effective.Kingsley', 'Winstone', 'are', 'best', 'things', 'film', 'Kingsley', 'electrifying', 'Everything', 'Don', 'menacing', 'moment', 'get', 'image', 'lifelong', 'thief', 'tough', 'guy', 'Then', 'Kingsley', 'creating', 'one', 'most', 'menacing', 'characters', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'word', 'mouth', 'meant', 'hurt', 'harm', 'cause', 'damage.Winstone', 'just', 'opposite', 'Gal', 'former', 'gangster', 'get', 'immediately', 'character', 'very', 'determined', 'live', 'new', 'life', 'wife', 'whom', 'obviously', 'dearly', 'very', 'happy', 'Don', 'life', 'maintain', 'cool', 'stick', 'guns', 'quiet', 'steely', 'resolve', 'very', 'effective', 'film', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'far', 'great', 'film', 'enough', 'going', 'keep', 'people', 'interested', 'entertained', 'also', 'eagerly', 'anticipate', 'Glazer', 'next', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'create', 'something', 'very', 'memorable']",N/A

Ben Kingsley is one of the most menacing villians to ever grace the screen and like nothing you have ever seen before.
