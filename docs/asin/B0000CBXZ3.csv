775230,A3B1V3AUUV13R6,B0000CBXZ3,Adrien Caldwell,"[0, 1]","I give this movie three stars. At first I wanted to give it a lower rating but I think this has to do with my own discomfort of what it's like to be unemployed and worrying about money. However, after extra consideration, I have to say that a movie is pretty powerful if it can evoke emotions regardless if they are happy, sad or anxiety provoking.The acting was good, there were lines that made me smile and the overwhelming dismal lives of several friends all suffering unemployment had a sense of authenticity to it. The direction was on target with how a person can become full of doubt on so many levels when one loses his/her paycheck.It's not a comfortable film. Men and women in their late 40's and early 50's suffering job discrimination is also made apparent in this movie. This, of course, reflects real life situations as younger candidates tend to be preferred by employers.It was kind of funny how they made Javier B&aacute;rdem's appearance look older by shaving a widow's peak into his hairline. This was apparently obvious in the very first scene with him as you can see the 5 o'clock shadow where his real hairline is. He also gained some weight for this film or wore a ""chunky"" suit (not so much a fat suit).It's not a bad film but due to the somber nature of the film it's not amazing either. I didn't get a new perspective nor was I shown a piece of art. Basically I felt as though I saw a typical struggle that we, as economy sufferers, see and hear all too often on the news and read in the paper.",3,Quite good.,1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,1520,"['give', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'first', 'wanted', 'give', 'lower', 'rating', 'think', 'do', 'own', 'discomfort', 'what', 'be', 'unemployed', 'worrying', 'money', 'However', 'extra', 'consideration', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'can', 'evoke', 'emotions', 'regardless', 'are', 'happy', 'sad', 'anxiety', 'provoking.The', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'were', 'lines', 'made', 'smile', 'overwhelming', 'dismal', 'lives', 'several', 'friends', 'suffering', 'unemployment', 'had', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'direction', 'was', 'target', 'how', 'person', 'can', 'become', 'full', 'doubt', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'when', 'one', 'his/her', 'paycheck.It', 'not', 'comfortable', 'film', 'Men', 'women', 'late', '40', 'early', '50', 'suffering', 'job', 'discrimination', 'also', 'made', 'apparent', 'movie', 'course', 'real', 'life', 'situations', 'younger', 'candidates', 'tend', 'be', 'preferred', 'employers.It', 'was', 'kind', 'funny', 'how', 'made', 'Javier', 'B', 'aacute', 'rdem', 'appearance', 'look', 'older', 'shaving', 'widow', 'peak', 'hairline', 'was', 'apparently', 'obvious', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'can', 'see', '5', ""o'clock"", 'shadow', 'where', 'real', 'hairline', 'also', 'gained', 'weight', 'film', 'wore', 'chunky', 'suit', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'fat', 'suit', '.It', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'due', 'somber', 'nature', 'film', 'not', 'amazing', 'either', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'new', 'perspective', 'was', 'shown', 'piece', 'art', 'Basically', 'felt', 'saw', 'typical', 'struggle', 'economy', 'sufferers', 'see', 'hear', 'too', 'often', 'news', 'read', 'paper']",Mondays in the Sun

775232,A3Q77CS1DEQLMG,B0000CBXZ3,Alessandro Bruno,"[5, 6]","""Mondays in the Sun"" by Fernando Le&oacute;n de Aranoa.  Is a film which, as many critics have noted, revolves around Rico's Bar. It is the space where the defeat, its memory and the personal and collective failures represented by the laying off of shipyard workers in a town in Spain's Galicia region takes place.  The bar, however, is more than anything a metaphor for the desolation of the present of the squalor of forced `relaxation' and of the immobility of time, which is lived in the vain hope of a redemption. The bar, set up by Rico - one of the laid off workers - serves as the place of exile where the former workers develop their survival strategies. Anyone wh&oacute; has ever felt the pain of unemployemnt, teh depressing effect it has on persoanl relationships and self esteem should watch this film. I found it truly remarkable and features a wonderful performance by Javier Bardem as 'Santa', an actor who often tackles social issues. the film will apeal to anyone who appreciates the cinema of Ken Loach, as it deals with the very themes that characterize the great British director's work. I saw the film in the origianl Spanish, and if you have to get a subtitle edition or wyou will miss great perfomances. Perhaops the most striking thing, in my opinion, in the film is a simple line pronounced by Sergei, a Russian emigr&eacute; character who says: ""They told us wonderful things about communism and they were all false. They told us horrible things about capitalism, and they're all true"". This apparently simple line speaks volumes about the film and its portrayal of what is one of the saddest aspects of modern life in a society that is losing all idealism",5,The vain hope of redemption,1074470400,"01 19, 2004",2004,1684,"['Mondays', 'Sun', 'Fernando', 'Le', 'oacute', 'Aranoa', 'film', 'many', 'critics', 'have', 'noted', 'Rico', 'Bar', 'space', 'where', 'defeat', 'memory', 'personal', 'collective', 'failures', 'represented', 'laying', 'shipyard', 'workers', 'town', 'Spain', 'Galicia', 'region', 'place', 'bar', 'however', 'more', 'anything', 'metaphor', 'desolation', 'present', 'squalor', 'forced', 'relaxation', 'immobility', 'time', 'lived', 'vain', 'hope', 'redemption', 'bar', 'set', 'up', 'Rico', 'one', 'laid', 'workers', 'serves', 'place', 'exile', 'where', 'former', 'workers', 'develop', 'survival', 'strategies', 'Anyone', 'wh', 'oacute', 'ever', 'felt', 'pain', 'unemployemnt', 'teh', 'depressing', 'effect', 'persoanl', 'relationships', 'esteem', 'should', 'watch', 'film', 'found', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Javier', 'Bardem', ""'Santa"", 'actor', 'who', 'often', 'social', 'issues', 'film', 'will', 'apeal', 'anyone', 'who', 'cinema', 'Ken', 'Loach', 'very', 'characterize', 'great', 'British', 'director', 'work', 'saw', 'film', 'origianl', 'Spanish', 'have', 'get', 'subtitle', 'edition', 'wyou', 'will', 'miss', 'great', 'perfomances', 'Perhaops', 'most', 'striking', 'thing', 'opinion', 'film', 'simple', 'line', 'pronounced', 'Sergei', 'Russian', 'emigr', 'eacute', 'character', 'who', 'told', 'wonderful', 'things', 'communism', 'were', 'false', 'told', 'horrible', 'things', 'capitalism', ""'re"", 'true', 'apparently', 'simple', 'line', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'film', 'portrayal', 'what', 'one', 'saddest', 'aspects', 'modern', 'life', 'society', 'losing', 'idealism']",Mondays in the Sun

Some scenes are plenty of interesting ""messages"".For all of this, ""Mondays in the Sun"" is fantastic. What is the problem? The problem is the story itself. You can use best actors, best studios, best screenplay. But when the story is plain and gives you no new point of view of a well-known work conflict, you have the sensation you have been not a film, not even a documental, but an article in a TV magazine.This film has been overprized and overpraised here in Spain. We have terrible work conflicts, and some of them have to do with naval industry. I think this film is very superficial because it shows dismissed workers as losers but happy. And those who have earned a life and have raised from nothing are shown as naive and sad.And so this is not a good message for young people trying to earn for a life.",3,The story of the losers,1096934400,"10 5, 2004",2004,926,"['can', 'not', 'say', 'liked', 'film', 'thing', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'story', 'developed', 'calmly', 'not', 'too', 'slowly', 'scenes', 'are', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'messages', '.For', 'Mondays', 'Sun', 'fantastic', 'What', 'problem', 'problem', 'story', 'can', 'use', 'best', 'actors', 'best', 'studios', 'best', 'screenplay', 'when', 'story', 'plain', 'new', 'point', 'view', 'well-known', 'work', 'conflict', 'have', 'sensation', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'documental', 'article', 'TV', 'magazine.This', 'film', 'been', 'overprized', 'overpraised', 'here', 'Spain', 'have', 'terrible', 'work', 'conflicts', 'have', 'do', 'naval', 'industry', 'think', 'film', 'very', 'superficial', 'dismissed', 'workers', 'losers', 'happy', 'who', 'have', 'earned', 'life', 'have', 'raised', 'nothing', 'are', 'shown', 'naive', 'so', 'not', 'good', 'message', 'young', 'people', 'trying', 'earn', 'life']",Mondays in the Sun
775234,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,B0000CBXZ3,Giordano Bruno,"[1, 1]","... brought down Communism in Poland, but it was no match for Capitalism in Spain.That's a paraphrase of the joke told by Sergei, the only immigrant among the laid-off Spanish shipyard workers: one Russian says to the other, ""Everything they told us about Communism was a lie!"" the other worker answers, ""Yeah, and everything they [their CP Comrades] said about Capitalism was true!""Capitalism has failed for these guys. Their shipyard 'downsized' the workforce peremptorily, the workers not laid off went on strike in solidarity, violence broke out - as the shipyard owners very clearly expected and hoped - and now the shipyard is closed and there are no jobs for men in their forties. The most pragmatic of the six friends has collected some severance pay and opened a bar where the other five hang out together, sharing what money they have, sharing their anger, getting on each other's nerves but clinging together desperately, having no other resource. There's no other unifying story in this film; each of them has a situation outside the bar, a life extraneous to their male bonding. Two of them have wives, two have kids, one had a wife whom he pretends will be coming back, one of them - Santa, played by Javier Bardem, the cockiest of the crew, effectively the ringleader - seethes with pride and resentment and dreams of Australia. He's also the randiest, with money somehow or with 'charm' enough to attract a Babe as well as flirting with his barkeeper-buddy's teenage daughter. Santa is half obnoxious S.0.B  and half true blue. In the end, he's the mourner and the scorner, the cogent critic of globalization and the ringleader of a stupid prank that leaves the friends all floating adrift on a stolen ferry.There are some very funny scenes in this film but the humor is always the sort to make you grit your teeth. In fact, the loyalty these six guys show to each other is the only relief from ugliness and failure in their run-down rusted defaced world. And it's the ensemble acting of the six - Bardem, Luis Tosar, Jos&eacute; Egido, Enrique Vill&eacute;n, Celso Bugallo, Joaqu&iacute;n Climent, and Serge Riaboukine, all superbly individualized  - that redeems the grimness and plotlessness of the film. The daughter - A&iacute;da Folch - and the long-suffering wife played by Nieve de Medina are both spot-perfect in their roles. This Goya Award winner was made in 2003, before Bardem became too recognizable to anglophone audiences from his role in 'No Country for Old Men.' It's a handicap for any actor, being recognizable, but Bardem is convincing anyway.Whatever socio-political relevance you might choose to see in this film, what makes it powerful is the gritty realism of the script and the sympathy each actor coaxes out of us for his character.",5,Solidarity ...,1293753600,"12 31, 2010",2010,2775,"['brought', 'down', 'Communism', 'Poland', 'was', 'match', 'Capitalism', 'Spain.That', 'paraphrase', 'joke', 'told', 'Sergei', 'only', 'immigrant', 'laid-off', 'Spanish', 'shipyard', 'workers', 'one', 'Russian', 'other', 'Everything', 'told', 'Communism', 'was', 'lie', 'other', 'worker', 'answers', 'Yeah', 'everything', '[', 'CP', 'Comrades', ']', 'said', 'Capitalism', 'was', 'true', 'Capitalism', 'failed', 'guys', 'shipyard', ""'downsized"", 'workforce', 'peremptorily', 'workers', 'not', 'laid', 'off', 'went', 'strike', 'solidarity', 'violence', 'broke', 'out', 'shipyard', 'owners', 'very', 'clearly', 'expected', 'hoped', 'now', 'shipyard', 'closed', 'are', 'jobs', 'men', 'forties', 'most', 'pragmatic', 'six', 'friends', 'collected', 'severance', 'pay', 'opened', 'bar', 'where', 'other', 'five', 'hang', 'together', 'sharing', 'what', 'money', 'have', 'sharing', 'anger', 'getting', 'other', 'nerves', 'clinging', 'together', 'desperately', 'having', 'other', 'resource', 'other', 'unifying', 'story', 'film', 'situation', 'bar', 'life', 'extraneous', 'male', 'bonding', 'Two', 'have', 'wives', 'two', 'have', 'kids', 'one', 'had', 'wife', 'whom', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'back', 'one', 'Santa', 'played', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'cockiest', 'crew', 'effectively', 'ringleader', 'seethes', 'pride', 'resentment', 'dreams', 'Australia', 'also', 'randiest', 'money', 'somehow', ""'charm"", 'enough', 'attract', 'Babe', 'as', 'well', 'flirting', 'barkeeper-buddy', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Santa', 'half', 'obnoxious', 'S.0.B', 'half', 'true', 'blue', 'end', 'mourner', 'scorner', 'cogent', 'critic', 'globalization', 'ringleader', 'stupid', 'prank', 'friends', 'floating', 'adrift', 'stolen', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'film', 'humor', 'always', 'sort', 'make', 'grit', 'teeth', 'fact', 'loyalty', 'six', 'guys', 'show', 'other', 'only', 'relief', 'ugliness', 'failure', 'run-down', 'rusted', 'defaced', 'world', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'six', 'Bardem', 'Luis', 'Tosar', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'Egido', 'Enrique', 'Vill', 'eacute', 'Celso', 'Bugallo', 'Joaqu', 'iacute', 'Climent', 'Serge', 'Riaboukine', 'superbly', 'individualized', 'grimness', 'plotlessness', 'film', 'daughter', 'iacute', 'Folch', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'played', 'Nieve', 'Medina', 'are', 'spot-perfect', 'roles', 'Goya', 'Award', 'winner', 'was', 'made', '2003', 'Bardem', 'became', 'too', 'recognizable', 'anglophone', 'audiences', 'role', ""'No"", 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'handicap', 'actor', 'being', 'recognizable', 'Bardem', 'convincing', 'anyway.Whatever', 'socio-political', 'relevance', 'might', 'choose', 'see', 'film', 'what', 'powerful', 'gritty', 'realism', 'script', 'sympathy', 'actor', 'coaxes', 'character']",Mondays in the Sun

Certainly, the slow pace of bar room banter coupled with the latent rage of the characters do not make for gripping drama. Yet, for the patient viewer, this award-winning Spanish movie becomes cinema verite at its best. The many subtle shades of human emotion and motives in the lives of these characters as they precariously tread in unemployment, are rendered with an unhurried pace which matches the reality they face daily of no real exit from misfortune other than to console themselves with each other.

Some of the characters react by accepting menial jobs as temporizing, their wives work packing smelly tuna in cans, and others react with a venom that is only slightly beneath the skin and strike out at the establishment for allowing their jobs to be taken by cheaper foreign countries (ships will now be built in Korea).  Sound familiar?  Well, here in a minimal setting we have all of the chaos and loss of dignity of the unemployed of the world portrayed by a talented cast and directed with realistic fervor.  Javier Bardem once again proves that he is a consummate actor, taking the lead role of a man without money, job, and respect and somehow finds humanism in this grim part.  The story progresses slowly, not unlike the sad days of the men who while away their useless lives in a bar owned by on of their comrades.  In this micro setting we are given macro feelings and emotions and a sense of camaraderie that overcomes the sadness of their lives.  This is not an entertaining movie.

Despite that, it is worthwhile seeing, and remembering...Why?. Because it tells us the story of a group of friends, former workers in a shipyard, who were sacked from their jobs and are unemployed. The spectators will watch them look repeatedly and uselessly for a new job, and deal with being unemployed and old in a society where most jobs are for young people. As a result, viewers are likely to realize that having a job isn't only about earning money, but also part of who we are, to a certain extent. And in the case of most of these men, their identities are in need of a redefinition that gives their lives new meaning.This story takes place in Spain, but it could have been set in many other places. ""Mondays in the Sun"" is a film about unemployment and friendship, and those are things that are everywhere. As such, you are highly unlikely to find the message of this movie irrelevant. Even if you have a job (and that is my case), you probably know that some people don't, and that they suffer the consequences of that lack.It is pertinent to point out that this isn't a film that will make you laugh. It is somewhat gloomy at times, and the actors play well the roles of people on the edge, eager to strike out at whomever is near them. Santa (Javier Bardem) is specially impressive as a man who doesn't have a clue regarding what to do with himself now that he doesn't have a job.Another of the characters of this story is Serguei (Serge Riaboukine), a former Russian astronaut who is in Spain looking for a job. Serguei tells the others a joke: ""Two old party comrades meet and one says `All that we were told about communism was a lie'. The other says `Yes, but the worst thing is that all we were told about capitalism was true'. In that silly joke, said by chance, we can find the root of the problem that aflicts these men...Truth to be told, ""Mondays in the Sun"" tells us what happens to those left behind by capitalism. Of course, capitalism is not always good, but all the other systems are even worse. However, that doesn't mean we can deny that our system has problems that must be solved. This movie gets that point across powerfully, and because of that I highly recommend it.Belen Alcat",4,"`All that we were told about communism was a lie', `but the worst thing is that all we were told about capitalism was true'",1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,2313,"['Mondays', 'Sun', 'directed', 'Fernando', 'Le', 'oacute', 'Aranoa', 'movie', 'where', 'not', 'much', 'happens', 'worthwhile', 'seeing', 'remembering', 'Why', 'story', 'group', 'friends', 'former', 'workers', 'shipyard', 'who', 'were', 'sacked', 'jobs', 'are', 'unemployed', 'spectators', 'will', 'watch', 'look', 'repeatedly', 'uselessly', 'new', 'job', 'deal', 'being', 'unemployed', 'old', 'society', 'where', 'most', 'jobs', 'are', 'young', 'people', 'result', 'viewers', 'are', 'likely', 'realize', 'having', 'job', ""n't"", 'only', 'earning', 'money', 'also', 'part', 'who', 'are', 'certain', 'extent', 'case', 'most', 'men', 'identities', 'are', 'need', 'redefinition', 'lives', 'new', 'meaning.This', 'story', 'place', 'Spain', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'many', 'other', 'places', 'Mondays', 'Sun', 'film', 'unemployment', 'friendship', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'everywhere', 'such', 'are', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'find', 'message', 'movie', 'irrelevant', 'Even', 'have', 'job', 'case', 'probably', 'know', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'consequences', 'lack.It', 'pertinent', 'point', 'out', ""n't"", 'film', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'somewhat', 'gloomy', 'times', 'actors', 'play', 'well', 'roles', 'people', 'edge', 'eager', 'strike', 'out', 'whomever', 'Santa', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'specially', 'impressive', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'regarding', 'what', 'do', 'now', ""n't"", 'have', 'job.Another', 'characters', 'story', 'Serguei', 'Serge', 'Riaboukine', 'former', 'Russian', 'astronaut', 'who', 'Spain', 'looking', 'job', 'Serguei', 'others', 'joke', 'Two', 'old', 'party', 'comrades', 'meet', 'one', 'were', 'told', 'communism', 'was', 'lie', 'other', 'Yes', 'worst', 'thing', 'were', 'told', 'capitalism', 'was', 'true', 'silly', 'joke', 'said', 'chance', 'can', 'find', 'root', 'problem', 'men', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Mondays', 'Sun', 'what', 'left', 'behind', 'capitalism', 'course', 'capitalism', 'not', 'always', 'good', 'other', 'systems', 'are', 'even', 'worse', 'However', ""n't"", 'mean', 'can', 'deny', 'system', 'problems', 'must', 'be', 'solved', 'movie', 'point', 'powerfully', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.Belen', 'Alcat']",Mondays in the Sun

Those who accept that view sacrifice their responsibility, and therefore a chunk of their humanity. So, the characters in this film hobble along rather pathetically and childishly, waiting for someone to restart their lives. Bardem is a fine actor, and the others do well, but this is a slight film offering no useful insights. It stands in stark contrast to films by the great director, Zhang Yimou, whose characters inhabit far more difficult conditions, but who struggle mightily to overcome the odds and maintain their pride. As one of the characters hints when slandering Koreans, a Europe awash in the welfare state has much to fear from industrious workers from Asia and elsewhere.",2,"Sterling acting, shallow story",1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,823,"['story', 'imbued', 'European', 'mindset', 'people', 'are', 'owed', 'job', 'meaningful', 'life', 'businesses', 'government', 'who', 'accept', 'view', 'sacrifice', 'responsibility', 'therefore', 'chunk', 'humanity', 'So', 'characters', 'film', 'hobble', 'rather', 'pathetically', 'childishly', 'waiting', 'someone', 'restart', 'lives', 'Bardem', 'fine', 'actor', 'others', 'do', 'well', 'slight', 'film', 'offering', 'useful', 'insights', 'stark', 'contrast', 'films', 'great', 'director', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'far', 'more', 'difficult', 'conditions', 'who', 'struggle', 'mightily', 'overcome', 'odds', 'maintain', 'pride', 'one', 'characters', 'hints', 'when', 'slandering', 'Koreans', 'Europe', 'awash', 'welfare', 'state', 'much', 'fear', 'industrious', 'workers', 'Asia', 'elsewhere']",Mondays in the Sun
775241,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0000CBXZ3,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","&lt;strong>Los Lunes al Sol&lt;/strong> (Fernando Leon de Aranoa, 2002)I don't remember who it was that told me, or where I read, nine or ten years ago, that &lt;em>Los Lunes al Sol&lt;/em> (in English, &lt;em>Mondays in the Sun&lt;/em>) is a comedy. I want to find that person and hit him in the teeth. Not only is this movie not a comedy, it is one of the most relentlessly depressing movies I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. Which is not to say it is not a good film; it is quite a good film indeed. I believe, however, the depression factor is ultimately to the film's detriment; it struck me while watching that this is a film that requires multiple viewings to truly appreciate, and I cannot for the life of me imagine a time where I would have a strong desire to watch it again, despite its merits.Plot: There isn't one, really, to this slice-of-life drama: six friends, longtime stevedores, lost their jobs at the dockyard three years ago. Of them, only Rico (&lt;em>Balade Triste de Trompeta&lt;/em>'s Joaqu&iacute;n Climent) has managed to make something of himself--he took his savings and opened a bar across from the now-shuttered dockyeard, where the other five members of the group drink for free. There's Santa (&lt;em>Before Night Falls&lt;/em>' Javier Bardem), a foulmouthed cynic and the unofficial leader of the group, always looking for under-the-table cash that doesn't require him to do any real work, while trying to keep out of the way of his old employer, who are suing him for breaking a light. Lino (&lt;em>Abre los Ojos&lt;/em>' Jos&eacute; &Aacute;ngel Egido), the eternal optimist, is always on his way to an interview or a rumored opening to fill out an application. Jos&eacute; (&lt;em>Tambien la Lluvia&lt;/em>'s Luis Tosar) is currently being supported by his wife, Ana (&lt;em>El Bola&lt;/em>'s Nieve de Medina), who's been working in a tuna canning factory, but the longer she supports him, the angrier he gets at himself and his situation. Reina (&lt;em>El Crimen Perfecto&lt;/em>'s Enrique Vill&eacute;n) has picked up a temp job as a security guard, but he's stifled by the unfulfilling nature of the job. Last, but by no means least, is Amador (&lt;em>Mar Adentro&lt;/em>'s Celso Bugallo), whose wife left him soon after he lost his job, and who spends his days lost in a fantasy world where she's on her way back to him. De Aranoa and co-screenwriter Ignacio del Moral put these guys in the situation, then pretty much sit back and let things unfold as they will.I don't think it's a spoiler to say this will not end well, especially now, ten years later, and especially not in America. Reviews of the movie posted back in the day on IMDB often end with an imprecation along the lines of ""...and the viewer will end up hoping he never has to live through this."" Fast-forward to 2012, and in the cases of some folks I know, three years out of work is something they saw in the rear view mirror back in 2011. I'm not sure why I put off watching this movie until now (I'm a huge Javier Bardem fan and will watch him in anything), but I'm not sure, having now seen it, whether it would have had the impact on me it did had I watched it when it first came out. Now, I know these people. In fact, some of them are my closest friends; all of us have, at some point in the past decade, been out of work for at least a year (yours truly included). It's funny how the universe works like that. And with the benfit of that hindsight, I will tell you that these screenwriters and these actors have done their damnedest to come up with the gritty ugliness of the aituation and present it in as realistic a way as possible. The problem being, of course, that ""realistic"" brings us back to where we are at the beginning of this paragraph--knowing that things will not end well.Be that as it may, and with the warning from the first paragraph in mind that this movie may require multiple viewings to get to the bottom of and I can't imagine anyone with a shred of empathy having the fortitude to watch it more than once, it's still well worth that one watch. Especially if you can identify with the situation, even indirectly. ***",3,Brutally depressing.,1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,4174,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Los', 'Lunes', 'al', 'Sol', 'lt', '>', 'Fernando', 'Leon', 'Aranoa', '2002', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'who', 'was', 'told', 'where', 'read', 'nine', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'lt', '>', 'Los', 'Lunes', 'al', 'Sol', 'lt', '>', 'English', 'lt', '>', 'Mondays', 'Sun', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'comedy', 'want', 'find', 'person', 'hit', 'teeth', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'not', 'comedy', 'one', 'most', 'relentlessly', 'depressing', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'displeasure', 'sitting', 'Which', 'not', 'say', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'film', 'indeed', 'believe', 'however', 'depression', 'factor', 'ultimately', 'film', 'detriment', 'struck', 'watching', 'film', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'can', 'not', 'life', 'imagine', 'time', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'strong', 'desire', 'watch', 'again', 'merits.Plot', ""n't"", 'one', 'really', 'slice-of-life', 'drama', 'six', 'friends', 'longtime', 'stevedores', 'lost', 'jobs', 'dockyard', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'Rico', 'lt', '>', 'Balade', 'Triste', 'de', 'Trompeta', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Joaqu', 'iacute', 'Climent', 'managed', 'make', 'something', 'took', 'savings', 'opened', 'bar', 'now-shuttered', 'dockyeard', 'where', 'other', 'five', 'members', 'group', 'drink', 'free', 'Santa', 'lt', '>', 'Night', 'Falls', 'lt', '>', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'foulmouthed', 'cynic', 'unofficial', 'leader', 'group', 'always', 'looking', 'under-the-table', 'cash', ""n't"", 'require', 'do', 'real', 'work', 'trying', 'keep', 'way', 'old', 'employer', 'who', 'are', 'suing', 'breaking', 'light', 'Lino', 'lt', '>', 'Abre', 'los', 'Ojos', 'lt', '>', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'Aacute', 'Egido', 'eternal', 'optimist', 'always', 'way', 'interview', 'rumored', 'opening', 'fill', 'out', 'application', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'lt', '>', 'Tambien', 'la', 'Lluvia', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Luis', 'Tosar', 'currently', 'being', 'supported', 'wife', 'Ana', 'lt', '>', 'El', 'Bola', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Nieve', 'de', 'Medina', 'who', 'been', 'working', 'tuna', 'canning', 'factory', 'longer', 'angrier', 'situation', 'Reina', 'lt', '>', 'El', 'Crimen', 'Perfecto', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Enrique', 'Vill', 'eacute', 'picked', 'up', 'temp', 'job', 'security', 'guard', 'stifled', 'unfulfilling', 'nature', 'job', 'Last', 'means', 'least', 'Amador', 'lt', '>', 'Mar', 'Adentro', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Celso', 'Bugallo', 'wife', 'left', 'soon', 'lost', 'job', 'who', 'days', 'lost', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'way', 'back', 'De', 'Aranoa', 'co-screenwriter', 'Ignacio', 'del', 'Moral', 'put', 'guys', 'situation', 'then', 'pretty', 'much', 'sit', 'back', 'let', 'things', 'unfold', 'will.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'spoiler', 'say', 'will', 'not', 'end', 'well', 'especially', 'now', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'especially', 'not', 'America', 'Reviews', 'movie', 'posted', 'back', 'day', 'IMDB', 'often', 'end', 'imprecation', 'lines', 'viewer', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'hoping', 'never', 'live', 'Fast-forward', '2012', 'cases', 'folks', 'know', 'three', 'years', 'work', 'something', 'saw', 'rear', 'view', 'mirror', 'back', '2011', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'put', 'off', 'watching', 'movie', 'now', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'fan', 'will', 'watch', 'anything', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'having', 'now', 'seen', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'impact', 'did', 'had', 'watched', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Now', 'know', 'people', 'fact', 'are', 'closest', 'friends', 'have', 'point', 'past', 'decade', 'been', 'work', 'least', 'year', 'truly', 'included', 'funny', 'how', 'universe', 'works', 'benfit', 'hindsight', 'will', 'tell', 'screenwriters', 'actors', 'have', 'done', 'damnedest', 'come', 'up', 'gritty', 'ugliness', 'aituation', 'present', 'realistic', 'way', 'possible', 'problem', 'being', 'course', 'realistic', 'back', 'where', 'are', 'beginning', 'paragraph', 'knowing', 'things', 'will', 'not', 'end', 'well.Be', 'may', 'warning', 'first', 'paragraph', 'mind', 'movie', 'may', 'require', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'get', 'bottom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'shred', 'empathy', 'having', 'fortitude', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'still', 'well', 'one', 'watch', 'Especially', 'can', 'identify', 'situation', 'even', 'indirectly', '***']",Mondays in the Sun
775242,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B0000CBXZ3,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[4, 4]","When this movie was made, viewers on this side of the Atlantic may well have regarded its unemployed shipyard workers as losers who might have made something of themselves if they'd just been more resourceful instead of waiting for some outside agency to solve their problems. Now in the current economic crisis in the US, workers of all kinds are losing jobs by the millions, and the experience of the ""losers"" in this film is a whole lot more relevant.Javier Bardem's Santo is the most articulate of the bunch and explains most clearly what was in fact lost during the layoffs that put them all out of work - the unity and solidarity that they once had as a community of working men. Willing, so he says, to work at all costs to preserve that community, they were broken instead by a company ready to sell-out in the face of foreign competition. Drifting now in mid-life, they must fight self-defeat and humiliation. Having given the best years of their lives contributing to a social order they'd been encouraged to believe in, they are now cast off as useless.Clinging to his pride as a man and a skilled worker, Santo helps prop up the men around him, using anger, humor, and wit to keep them going, while refusing to let them feel alone and abandoned. His older friend Paulino keeps going to job interviews, dyeing his hair and borrowing his son's sweater to appear younger. Another friend, Jose, is at the point of losing his wife, who is the wage-earner of the two, holding down a miserable job in a fish cannery. While the film sounds like a downer, there are also belly laughs and moments of sheer delight, as when the men join two teenager girls at a karaoke bar to sing ""Volare.""Not a film for everyone. If you want a strong plot and lots of action, don't bother. You'll hate it. Watch instead for a brilliant performance from a portly, bearded Javier Bardem and an excellent supporting cast, including Luis Tosar. The script is also strong, as characters debate the meaning of their situation. There's a lovely understated soundtrack, as well. It's probably best to watch the making-of featurette first, which provides an informative context for the film for non-Spanish viewers.",5,Unemployed . . .,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,2192,"['When', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'viewers', 'side', 'Atlantic', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'regarded', 'unemployed', 'shipyard', 'workers', 'losers', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'something', ""'d"", 'just', 'been', 'more', 'resourceful', 'instead', 'waiting', 'outside', 'agency', 'solve', 'problems', 'Now', 'current', 'economic', 'crisis', 'US', 'workers', 'kinds', 'are', 'losing', 'jobs', 'millions', 'experience', 'losers', 'film', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'relevant.Javier', 'Bardem', 'Santo', 'most', 'articulate', 'bunch', 'most', 'clearly', 'what', 'was', 'fact', 'lost', 'layoffs', 'put', 'work', 'unity', 'solidarity', 'once', 'had', 'community', 'working', 'men', 'Willing', 'work', 'costs', 'preserve', 'community', 'were', 'broken', 'instead', 'company', 'ready', 'sell-out', 'face', 'foreign', 'competition', 'Drifting', 'now', 'mid-life', 'must', 'fight', 'self-defeat', 'humiliation', 'Having', 'given', 'best', 'years', 'lives', 'contributing', 'social', 'order', ""'d"", 'been', 'encouraged', 'believe', 'are', 'now', 'cast', 'off', 'useless.Clinging', 'pride', 'man', 'skilled', 'worker', 'Santo', 'prop', 'up', 'men', 'using', 'anger', 'humor', 'wit', 'keep', 'going', 'refusing', 'let', 'feel', 'alone', 'abandoned', 'older', 'friend', 'Paulino', 'going', 'job', 'interviews', 'dyeing', 'hair', 'borrowing', 'son', 'sweater', 'appear', 'younger', 'friend', 'Jose', 'point', 'losing', 'wife', 'who', 'wage-earner', 'two', 'holding', 'down', 'miserable', 'job', 'fish', 'cannery', 'film', 'downer', 'are', 'also', 'belly', 'moments', 'sheer', 'delight', 'when', 'men', 'join', 'two', 'teenager', 'girls', 'karaoke', 'bar', 'sing', 'Volare', 'Not', 'film', 'everyone', 'want', 'strong', 'plot', 'lots', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'Watch', 'instead', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'portly', 'bearded', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Luis', 'Tosar', 'script', 'also', 'strong', 'characters', 'debate', 'meaning', 'situation', 'lovely', 'understated', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'well', 'probably', 'best', 'watch', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'first', 'informative', 'context', 'film', 'non-Spanish', 'viewers']",Mondays in the Sun
