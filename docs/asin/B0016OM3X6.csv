I couldn't have enjoyed the 3 included episodes more, and I'm about to order more of the Dogtown sets. I'd love to see a DVD about the cat side too, in case anybody with any clout to produce one is reading!!BTW, there don't appear to be any subtitles on this title, so you'll want to keep that in mind if they're important to you. I can't vouch for presence or absence of closed captions because I don't have a chip.",5,LOVED seeing Best Friends for the first time!!

It calls to mind a need for the prosecution of individuals that would cause harm to their animals and at the same time shows us a compassionate  way to help animals whose owners are no longer able to care for them.,5,Desperately needed and compassionate services for our animal friends,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,308,"['Well', 'done', 'documentary', 'coming', 'aid', 'animal', 'friends', 'have', 'other', 'help', 'mind', 'need', 'prosecution', 'individuals', 'would', 'cause', 'harm', 'animals', 'same', 'time', 'compassionate', 'way', 'help', 'animals', 'owners', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'care']",Dogtown: Second Chances Season 1

(they also have cats, birds, pigs, rabbits and horses there)This is an insightful series into the work they do to save and adopt out hundreds of dogs every year.There are usually about 450 dogs resident at Dogtown at any time. Best Friends works to adopt out as many as they can to forever homes. Any that can't be adopted for medical or behavioral reasons,  live there for the rest of their natural life under the care of staff and volunteers. After watching this series in late 2011, I was privileged to go to Best Friends in July 2013 and volunteer in Dogtown for 4 days. I am looking forward to a repeat visit in the future.",5,Fascinating and fun series for dog lovers,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,746,"['Dogtown', 'amazing', 'place', 'run', 'amazing', 'people', 'southern', 'Utah.It', 'part', 'Best', 'Friends', 'Animal', 'Sanctuary', 'also', 'have', 'cats', 'birds', 'pigs', 'rabbits', 'horses', 'there', 'insightful', 'series', 'work', 'do', 'save', 'adopt', 'out', 'hundreds', 'dogs', 'are', 'usually', '450', 'dogs', 'resident', 'Dogtown', 'time', 'Best', 'Friends', 'adopt', 'out', 'as', 'many', 'can', 'forever', 'homes', 'Any', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'adopted', 'medical', 'behavioral', 'reasons', 'live', 'there', 'rest', 'natural', 'life', 'care', 'staff', 'volunteers', 'watching', 'series', 'late', '2011', 'was', 'privileged', 'go', 'Best', 'Friends', 'July', '2013', 'volunteer', 'Dogtown', '4', 'days', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'repeat', 'visit', 'future']",Dogtown: Second Chances Season 1

This series came to my attention when I recently got ahold of the book,DogTown: Tales of Rescue, Rehabilitation, and Redemptionthat is due out in October.  Not having the National Geographic Channel, I bought this dvd.  I can't remember the last time I was so moved.  I think I cried three times.  I bawled my eyes out over Bruno dying.  I cried when a trainer had to part with the adorable Wiggles.  I shed a few tears over the terrified terrier, Animal.  I had to gather my own dogs onto my lap to comfort me!This dvd is three episodes.  The first is about a chow named Bruno that is really old and having some nerological problems.  There is also a dog that had bitten an infant and rather than allow it to be put to sleep, Dog Town attempts to train it around kids and such so that it may be adopted.  The second episode covers a group of dogs that were discovered abused and neglected in a breeding farm.  I did not realize this, but apparently breeding farms that sell to pet stores often keep dogs confined in a 2 by 2 cage and except for breeding once or twice a month, they obtain no physical contact with other dogs or humans whatsover.  That is where the terrier comes in.  The third episode warms hearts by introducing viewers to Wiggles, a bulldog with a drunken walk and a bowel problem.I learned a lot from these shows.  The next time I add to my family, I will getting my new family member from the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary.Something that did bother me, however... I can't help but wonder how the Navajo Reservation is allowed to have numerous dogs and permit them to run around with mange and worms, but in the suburbs of Utah, we can only have two dogs no matter how pampered, spoiled, and well cared for they are.  I was wondering this throughout all of espiode one.  I certainly would not mind adopting one of these dogs in need.Thumbs up to the people of DogTown.",5,I Am Volunteering At Best Friends When I Retire!,1253232000,"09 18, 2009",2009,1895,"['Wow', 'series', 'came', 'attention', 'when', 'recently', 'got', 'ahold', 'book', 'DogTown', 'Tales', 'Rescue', 'Rehabilitation', 'Redemptionthat', 'due', 'out', 'October', 'Not', 'having', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Channel', 'bought', 'dvd', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'think', 'cried', 'three', 'times', 'bawled', 'eyes', 'out', 'Bruno', 'dying', 'cried', 'when', 'trainer', 'had', 'part', 'adorable', 'Wiggles', 'shed', 'few', 'tears', 'terrified', 'terrier', 'Animal', 'had', 'gather', 'own', 'dogs', 'lap', 'comfort', 'dvd', 'three', 'episodes', 'first', 'chow', 'named', 'Bruno', 'really', 'old', 'having', 'nerological', 'problems', 'also', 'dog', 'had', 'bitten', 'infant', 'rather', 'allow', 'be', 'put', 'sleep', 'Dog', 'Town', 'attempts', 'train', 'around', 'kids', 'such', 'may', 'be', 'adopted', 'second', 'episode', 'group', 'dogs', 'were', 'discovered', 'abused', 'neglected', 'breeding', 'farm', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'apparently', 'breeding', 'farms', 'sell', 'pet', 'stores', 'often', 'keep', 'dogs', 'confined', '2', '2', 'cage', 'breeding', 'once', 'twice', 'month', 'obtain', 'physical', 'contact', 'other', 'dogs', 'humans', 'where', 'terrier', 'third', 'episode', 'warms', 'hearts', 'introducing', 'viewers', 'Wiggles', 'bulldog', 'drunken', 'walk', 'bowel', 'problem.I', 'learned', 'lot', 'shows', 'next', 'time', 'add', 'family', 'will', 'getting', 'new', 'family', 'member', 'Best', 'Friends', 'Animal', 'Sanctuary.Something', 'did', 'bother', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'Navajo', 'Reservation', 'allowed', 'have', 'numerous', 'dogs', 'permit', 'run', 'around', 'mange', 'worms', 'suburbs', 'Utah', 'can', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'dogs', 'matter', 'how', 'pampered', 'spoiled', 'well', 'cared', 'are', 'was', 'wondering', 'espiode', 'one', 'certainly', 'would', 'not', 'mind', 'adopting', 'one', 'dogs', 'up', 'people', 'DogTown']",Dogtown: Second Chances Season 1

But to watch these men & woman do the work their are so right for helps me at least see there are people who care about animals as much as I do.  To see the Dogs as they enter and happily leave Dog Town is a privilege that the film crew from National Geographic has been able to bring us to our homes.
