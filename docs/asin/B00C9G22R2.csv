1644923,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00C9G22R2,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I still remember rather vividly my first impression of Kar Wai Wong.  It was late, my wife and daughter were in bed, and I decided to take &#8216;Chungking Express&#8217; out of the Nexflix package and pop it in for some &#8216;me time&#8217;.  I&#8217;d been excited to wrap my head around the beloved hype that surrounded Wong as a director, but especially the film itself, which is often raved as his finest.  I sat there for the entirety of the film with wide eyes, basking in the beauty of it all, and then as it ended I found myself shaking off the veneer of visual splendor to declare the film a mediocre shame.THAT WAS IT?I know that my opinion of that particular film is a rare one (but I am not alone, I know that for sure) but it is my opinion and remains that way.  Sadly, my first experience with Wong was not the one I wanted it to be.  My second was much better, for the next film I saw was &#8216;My Blueberry Nights&#8217;, and once again it was visually stunning and yet confused, messy and somewhat vapid.They say third time is a charm for a reason; and &#8216;In the Mood for Love&#8217; is that reason.Since devouring that film, I&#8217;ve quickly consumed all things Kar Wai Wong, and I continue to look forward to his works despite the rare hiccups.  His trilogy (&#8216;Days of Being Wild&#8217;, &#8216;In the Mood for Love&#8217; & &#8216;2046&#8217;) remains my favorite trilogy of all time and his stunning ability to portray the hostilities, frailties and honesties of love in the most languid and richly beautiful ways has made films like &#8216;Happy Together&#8217; so utterly refreshing.  Having recently seen &#8216;Ashes of Time&#8217;, I felt good and ready for Wong&#8217;s take on the Kung-Fu genre (yes, I&#8217;m fully aware that &#8216;Ashes of Time&#8217; is NOT a Kung-Fu movie, but you can ascertain the similarities).  The fact that this received relatively strong reviews and even racked up a few Oscar nominations (and came close to a nomination for Foreign Film) had me even more excited for this to be a needed comeback for the director.Honestly, he hasn&#8217;t made ANYTHING since &#8216;My Blueberry Nights&#8217;!Sadly, for me at least, &#8216;The Grandmaster&#8217; was not the sweet redemption I wanted it to be.  Instead, this was kind of a tedious bore.  I will admit that walking in, I was not aware of any of the backstory of history of biographical shades to this story, so I was learning as it went along.  I wasn&#8217;t really interested.  Maybe I should have been, but I found it really hard to.  I think that this is one of those instances where a more linear or direct narrative would have benefited the film.  Instead, Wong&#8217;s signature visual style and flow is a distraction and makes this rather involved storyline feel empty and soulless.It just kind of floats visually but falls flat narratively.The layered storytelling, with flashbacks and narrative jumps, gets lost in the stylized visuals and becomes choppy and incoherent.  The story becomes increasingly more difficult to follow, the fights difficult to differentiate and the characters and ultimately the story itself almost impossible to care about.  Despite some rich cinematography and interestingly choreographed fight sequences (not to mention a beautifully tapered performance by Ziyi Zhang), &#8216;The Grandmaster&#8217; become an exercise in my patience as I try desperately to attach myself to it in some way.Instead I walked away thinking to myself&#8230;THAT WAS IT?And now we&#8217;re back where we started with Wong.",2,I expected something grander&#8230;,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,3563,"['still', 'remember', 'rather', 'vividly', 'first', 'impression', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Wong', 'was', 'late', 'wife', 'daughter', 'were', 'bed', 'decided', 'take', '8216', 'Chungking', 'Express', '8217', 'Nexflix', 'package', 'pop', '8216', 'time', '8217', '8217', 'been', 'excited', 'wrap', 'head', 'beloved', 'hype', 'surrounded', 'Wong', 'director', 'especially', 'film', 'often', 'raved', 'finest', 'sat', 'entirety', 'film', 'wide', 'eyes', 'basking', 'beauty', 'then', 'ended', 'found', 'shaking', 'off', 'veneer', 'visual', 'splendor', 'declare', 'film', 'mediocre', 'shame.THAT', 'WAS', 'IT', 'know', 'opinion', 'particular', 'film', 'rare', 'one', 'am', 'not', 'alone', 'know', 'sure', 'opinion', 'way', 'Sadly', 'first', 'experience', 'Wong', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'wanted', 'be', 'second', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'next', 'film', 'saw', 'was', '8216', 'Blueberry', 'Nights', '8217', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'visually', 'stunning', 'yet', 'confused', 'messy', 'somewhat', 'vapid.They', 'say', 'third', 'time', 'charm', 'reason', '8216', 'Mood', 'Love', '8217', 'reason.Since', 'devouring', 'film', '8217', 'quickly', 'consumed', 'things', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Wong', 'continue', 'look', 'forward', 'works', 'rare', 'hiccups', 'trilogy', '8216', 'Days', 'Being', 'Wild', '8217', '8216', 'Mood', 'Love', '8217', '8216', '2046', '8217', 'favorite', 'trilogy', 'time', 'stunning', 'ability', 'portray', 'hostilities', 'frailties', 'honesties', 'love', 'most', 'languid', 'richly', 'beautiful', 'ways', 'made', 'films', '8216', 'Happy', 'Together', '8217', 'utterly', 'refreshing', 'Having', 'recently', 'seen', '8216', 'Ashes', 'Time', '8217', 'felt', 'good', 'ready', 'Wong', '8217', 's', 'take', 'Kung-Fu', 'genre', 'yes', '8217', 'fully', 'aware', '8216', 'Ashes', 'Time', '8217', 'NOT', 'Kung-Fu', 'movie', 'can', 'ascertain', 'similarities', 'fact', 'received', 'relatively', 'strong', 'reviews', 'even', 'racked', 'up', 'few', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'came', 'close', 'nomination', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'had', 'even', 'more', 'excited', 'be', 'needed', 'comeback', 'director.Honestly', 'hasn', '8217', 'made', 'ANYTHING', '8216', 'Blueberry', 'Nights', '8217', 'Sadly', 'least', '8216', 'Grandmaster', '8217', 'was', 'not', 'sweet', 'redemption', 'wanted', 'be', 'Instead', 'was', 'kind', 'tedious', 'bore', 'will', 'admit', 'walking', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'backstory', 'history', 'biographical', 'shades', 'story', 'was', 'learning', 'went', 'along', 'wasn', '8217', 'really', 'interested', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'found', 'really', 'hard', 'think', 'one', 'instances', 'where', 'more', 'linear', 'direct', 'narrative', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'film', 'Instead', 'Wong', '8217', 's', 'signature', 'visual', 'style', 'flow', 'distraction', 'rather', 'involved', 'storyline', 'feel', 'empty', 'soulless.It', 'just', 'kind', 'floats', 'visually', 'flat', 'narratively.The', 'layered', 'storytelling', 'flashbacks', 'narrative', 'jumps', 'lost', 'stylized', 'visuals', 'choppy', 'incoherent', 'story', 'increasingly', 'more', 'difficult', 'follow', 'fights', 'difficult', 'differentiate', 'characters', 'ultimately', 'story', 'almost', 'impossible', 'care', 'rich', 'cinematography', 'interestingly', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'sequences', 'not', 'mention', 'beautifully', 'tapered', 'performance', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', '8216', 'Grandmaster', '8217', 'become', 'exercise', 'patience', 'try', 'desperately', 'attach', 'way.Instead', 'walked', 'away', 'thinking', 'myself', '8230', 'WAS', 'IT', 'now', '8217', 're', 'back', 'where', 'started', 'Wong']",THE Grandmaster with Tony Leung

Foreign films never ceize to touch the heart deep and tug at the soul to create that feeling of butterflies in the heart. They are not shallow and opposite of most martial art films. The film is filled with action and a lot of fighting nothing too spectaculiar but good enough. I don't know why but zhang ziyi never disappoints she is one of the best actresses around and maybe the best in her country. I love her. Such grace and beauty to this role. I love how she brings to life the love and beauty this film expresses through the poetry of words, skill and the art of fighting. What a lovely film. My only pet peeve is how foreign films always have this hint of dark kamikaze, depressing parts and twist as if it's forbidden to have any sort of happiness or happy ending. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth. This film is genuinely ""salt"" as in colorful and has a sense of value and worth, the opposite of garbage and junk which many films I've seen recently are.

1644931,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00C9G22R2,C. Sawin,"[4, 8]","""The Grandmaster"" is yet another retelling of Ip Man's life that is portrayed by Tony Leung this time around. The Chinese martial arts film mostly takes place between 1930 and 1952 with Ip Man's time in Foshan, his journey to Hong Kong once the Japanese invaded Foshan, becoming a martial arts master, and a brief mention of his death in 1972. Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang), a master from the North, comes to the South to hold a ceremony naming Ma San (Zhang Jin) as the heir to the North. After Gong Yutian encourages the South to do the same, the furious Northern masters are dealt with by Ma San rather effortlessly and Ip Man is called in to pick up the pieces. Worried that her father may lose a fight for the first time ever, Gong Yutian's daughter Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi) tries to convince him to not confront Ip Man. Their fight evolves into a battle of wits that has Ip Man walk away triumphant. ""The Grandmaster"" then evolves into not only a film chronicling Ip Man's life but also martial arts in general.As of this writing, ""The Grandmaster"" has yet to be released in the U.S. The Weinstein Company has secluded the rights to the film, has changed the name of the film to ""The Grandmasters,"" and looks to have set an August 23, 2013 theatrical release date for the film. If last year's ""Dragon"" is anything to go by, then The Weinstein Company is bound to make a few edits to the 130-minute duration of ""The Grandmaster."" What's unfortunate is the rough cut of the film was originally four hours long and so much of the film was cut that the second half of the film is kind of sloppy. So if The Weinstein Company decides to cut away even more then the film won't be salvageable or even watchable at all. What's more is director Wong Kar-wai says the 4-hour version doesn't exist and currently has no plans for that version ever seeing the light of day. So what you see is what you get with ""The Grandmaster.""What remains is this kind of beautiful disaster. The cinematography is absolutely extravagant. Fight scenes tend to play out in slow-motion, but its use of vibrant colors is just brilliant. You have this visual feast with the way the film feeds you glorious colors like red, green, gold, and even shades of white and black. The extraordinary set pieces and intricate costumes authenticate the time period while elements such as rain, snow, broken glass, and shimmering eyes that pull you in are utilized in ways to make every scene optically stunning. The down side is that there's always this really intense lighting used, especially during the rain and train station sequences, that seems really unnatural because of its intensity and time of day or night it's supposed to portray. The editing of the film is already off thanks to the film being chopped up, but it's even more so thanks to the way things are thrown into slow-motion so often for no reason. It's like the frame rate changes and everything becomes noticeably sluggish. Maybe it's just a DVD issue, but it becomes extremely distracting given the film's length.The action may make or break your opinion of the film, as well. The film is not just fight scene after fight scene as there's quite a bit of downtime, but the action is also a bit over exaggerated at times. There's quite a bit of wire work as natural elements and physics bend to these martial arts masters; stone walls are kicked through, a carriage is crushed with a single kick from each side at the same time, and characters defy gravity at times seemingly just because they can. It's not quite as overdone as some of Jet Li's films and is still pretty enjoyable overall, but if you can't stand wuxia films and are very stubborn about only liking realistic martial arts films then it could be an issue for you.The narrative is seriously flawed. Most of this can be blamed on the cut of the film, but the film will jump from Ip Man to Gong Er's pursuit of Ma San and stay on that for something like 30 minutes straight before jumping back to Ip Man and then having a random flashback to 1940 when the film has already touched on topics in 1950. Then there's The Razor character who is completely butchered (pun intended). The character is introduced, has an incredible action sequence and one other noteworthy scene but is never seen again after that. You never even get to see him confront Ip Man, which seems like a huge selling point for the film.This is a two-disc DVD set after all. There's bound to be something in the special features. Disappointingly enough, the special features are incredibly weak and aren't even translated into English on the Hong Kong all region DVD release. There are no deleted scenes or anything of much importance. The Making of section is mostly interviews and some behind the scenes stuff with each of the main characters, which gives you a brief glimpse at scenes that didn't make the film. Also included is the trailer, posters, a photo gallery, and cast and crew member bios.""The Grandmaster"" is absolutely breathtaking to watch as its cinematography is gloriously rich and the action sequences are executed beautifully. Tony Leung is fantastic as Ip Man as his confidence shines through every scene he's a part of. The conversation he has with Zhang Ziyi near the end of the film at the teahouse is particularly emotional and heartbreaking. The film suffers from really awkward edits though. Despite its camera work being clean and crisp, the rest of its presentation is completely unbalanced. If you can get past what could have been, ""The Grandmaster"" is still enjoyable but pales in comparison to Wilson Yip's ""Ip Man"" films.",3,A stunning film plagued by poor editing,1369180800,"05 22,

1644939,AXO4PQU0XG3TG,B00C9G22R2,Dwight,"[1, 2]","Beloved and lovely Northern Chinese - if you want to see why the Southerners light up with their visits, see this movie.  All of their integrity and moral NOBILITY is on display here in the performances of Zhang Ziyi and the rest of the Mainland actors here.  I have the original cut but I WISH there was a Director's Cut with all the missing scenes tantalizingly reported in the Chinese press.  The Southern Barbarians LOVE the Northern Han.In my double disc version, the features offer a computer graphic of the map of China with the names of the different participating regions appearing in brush strokes and as they appear, I realized that this is the hint of the united front of all the provinces, all the clans, all the socalled ""ethnicities"" of the Chinese united against the Japanese invasion.The story looks like the moving of Chinese kungfu ever Southward until it reaches the haven of British-controlled Hong Kong.  It doesn't make any sense/profit that they are all on the same street in Hong Kong if you don't wonder if these are all Japanese guerrilla fighters.The wife of Ip Man is played by a famous South Korean actress the casting of which despite her lack of lines indicates the Chinese position on Korean women in contrast to that of enemy Japan.  She actually has very similar underlying facial structure to Zhang Ziyi but the exterior is different.The Southern natives will never secede from The Greater Whole.  The Yuet people welcome the Han; all doors are open to them even without undeserved honors like the title of Grandmaster.  It's on the house just like the Southern pronunciation of poon choi and that is why every emperor worth his salt spent at least 90% of the national budget on building and reinforcing The Great Wall.If you like puns, Foshan sounds like volcano in Cantonese and the Mandarin pronunciation of Dongbei sounds like ""east evades"" more so than ""cold and sad"" in Cantonese.  Curiously, Ip Man's given name ""Man"" means ""question"" in Chinese so his name is Leaf Question(s).  What is he asking?When the Accounts Department greet Ip Man 26 minutes, I am reminded because I do need to be reminded that on the matter of Namibia alone, the monsters will pay and it will be by the hand of a precise and just hatred with no silliness.  Why was Michael Jackson a Jehovah's Witness if not because they shared the same murderer as the Namibians?SPOILER:the fight between ZZY and Ip Man resulted in a fair win because ZZY showed at least twice that she was willing to die/fail fighting and if Ip Man had responded unchivalrously, he would have been defeated thoroughly down the road - according to Chinese rules, Ip Man had no other choice than to act as he did.ETA 5/11/2014:  the existence of the Japanese Genyosha (see the wikipedia entry) creates a different view of this film.  The Northern successor becomes a collaborator.  The Southern one to his and his own family's fatal peril refuses while everyone all around him seems to have no problem with doing so.  The proceedings take place at a brothel in the beginning of the film, in the best brothel and the genyosha were known to have set up high end brothels to gather intelligence on wealthy and empowered locals.So they would have known everything.  They would have known about Zhang Ziyi's character as well as Ip Man's.No privacy indeed.So no sympathy for all the alleged suicides occuring amongst the corrupt officials today.  If the central government does not fix this problem, they become the rest of the world's problem.COLLABORATORS!",5,Collaborate or Perish:  Were the Genyosha observing from the very start?,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,3539,"['Beloved', 'lovely', 'Northern', 'Chinese', 'want', 'see', 'why', 'Southerners', 'light', 'up', 'visits', 'see', 'movie', 'integrity', 'moral', 'NOBILITY', 'display', 'here', 'performances', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'rest', 'Mainland', 'actors', 'here', 'have', 'original', 'cut', 'WISH', 'was', 'Director', 'Cut', 'missing', 'scenes', 'tantalizingly', 'reported', 'Chinese', 'press', 'Southern', 'Barbarians', 'LOVE', 'Northern', 'Han.In', 'double', 'disc', 'version', 'features', 'offer', 'computer', 'graphic', 'map', 'China', 'names', 'different', 'participating', 'regions', 'appearing', 'brush', 'strokes', 'appear', 'realized', 'hint', 'united', 'front', 'provinces', 'clans', 'socalled', 'ethnicities', 'Chinese', 'united', 'Japanese', 'invasion.The', 'story', 'looks', 'moving', 'Chinese', 'kungfu', 'ever', 'Southward', 'haven', 'British-controlled', 'Hong', 'Kong', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense/profit', 'are', 'same', 'street', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'do', ""n't"", 'wonder', 'are', 'Japanese', 'guerrilla', 'fighters.The', 'wife', 'Ip', 'Man', 'played', 'famous', 'South', 'Korean', 'casting', 'lack', 'lines', 'Chinese', 'position', 'Korean', 'women', 'contrast', 'enemy', 'Japan', 'actually', 'very', 'similar', 'underlying', 'facial', 'structure', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'exterior', 'different.The', 'Southern', 'natives', 'will', 'never', 'secede', 'Greater', 'Whole', 'Yuet', 'people', 'welcome', 'Han', 'doors', 'are', 'open', 'even', 'undeserved', 'honors', 'title', 'Grandmaster', 'house', 'just', 'Southern', 'pronunciation', 'poon', 'choi', 'why', 'emperor', 'salt', 'spent', 'least', '90', '%', 'national', 'budget', 'building', 'reinforcing', 'Great', 'Wall.If', 'puns', 'Foshan', 'volcano', 'Cantonese', 'Mandarin', 'pronunciation', 'Dongbei', 'east', 'evades', 'more', 'so', 'cold', 'sad', 'Cantonese', 'Curiously', 'Ip', 'Man', 'given', 'name', 'Man', 'question', 'Chinese', 'name', 'Leaf', 'Question', 's', 'What', 'asking', 'When', 'Accounts', 'Department', 'greet', 'Ip', 'Man', '26', 'minutes', 'am', 'reminded', 'do', 'be', 'reminded', 'matter', 'Namibia', 'alone', 'monsters', 'will', 'pay', 'will', 'be', 'hand', 'precise', 'just', 'hatred', 'silliness', 'Why', 'was', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Jehovah', 'Witness', 'not', 'shared', 'same', 'murderer', 'Namibians', 'SPOILER', 'fight', 'ZZY', 'Ip', 'Man', 'resulted', 'fair', 'win', 'ZZY', 'showed', 'least', 'twice', 'was', 'willing', 'die/fail', 'fighting', 'Ip', 'Man', 'had', 'responded', 'unchivalrously', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'defeated', 'thoroughly', 'road', 'according', 'Chinese', 'rules', 'Ip', 'Man', 'had', 'other', 'choice', 'act', '5/11/2014', 'existence', 'Japanese', 'Genyosha', 'see', 'wikipedia', 'entry', 'different', 'view', 'film', 'Northern', 'successor', 'collaborator', 'Southern', 'one', 'own', 'family', 'fatal', 'peril', 'refuses', 'everyone', 'have', 'problem', 'doing', 'so', 'proceedings', 'take', 'place', 'brothel', 'beginning', 'film', 'best', 'brothel', 'genyosha', 'were', 'known', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'high', 'end', 'brothels', 'gather', 'intelligence', 'wealthy', 'empowered', 'locals.So', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'everything', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'Ip', ""Man's.No"", 'privacy', 'sympathy', 'alleged', 'suicides', 'occuring', 'corrupt', 'officials', 'today', 'central', 'government', 'not', 'fix', 'problem', 'become', 'rest', 'world', 'problem.COLLABORATORS']",THE Grandmaster with Tony Leung

The film chronicles the life of the man most well-known for training the legendary Bruce Lee - taking place mostly during the 1930s.  However, long before he trained Lee, Yip Man lived a once peaceful life with a wife and children.  But, when a grandmaster, Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang), retires, a martial arts civil war breaks out between North and South China. Yip Man is chosen to represent his country in the South, eventually defeating the master, which prompts his daughter, Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi) to reclaim her family's honor by facing-off against Ip Man.  The two are intrigued with one another, and attempt to stay in contact.  Eventually, the Japanese invade China and force him to abandon his comfortable life, choosing to face down a life of poverty and become a martial arts teacher.  Chang Chen, Zhao Benshan, and Song Hye-kyo also star in supporting roles.To be honest, this is a film that will try your patience as a movie lover in more ways than one.  Since this is a Chinese film, the film is completely subtitled (that's not a knock, just a vital piece of information that you should be prepared for, especially if subtitles aren't your cup of tea).  Aside from the subtitles, this is a film that bounces around quite a bit as a great deal of information is covered and interpreted in a relatively short amount of time (depending which cut of the film you see - since there are three).  The film focuses mainly on Ip Man, but also intertwines with Gong Er - portrayed by the emotionally-engaging Zhang Ziyi.  From the get-go, The Grandmaster describes how each martial artist uses his or her own fighting techniques, often incorporating more than one style - and adapt it to their own.  This vital information (seeming irrelevant at times) is vital to the overall understanding of these historical figures.  In the event that you're not familiar with martial arts (and I'll happily admit I was pretty clueless), this film can be unexpectedly difficult to follow.Admittedly, The Grandmaster can quickly lose your attention with its scattered plot and quick movements, and it's understandable if you end up checking your watch a few times.  But, just when you think it's lost its way - the martial art action kicks in to save this film from the abyss.  In fact, the opening sequence is by far the most enjoyable sequence of the film as Yip Man quickly squares off against an endless amount of ""bad guys"" - in the rain, no less.  It will quickly feel reminiscent of the fight sequence between Neo and Agent Smith in The Matrix: Revelations - only without the endless amount of buildings being destroyed.  Regardless, this sequence is a wonderful piece of choreography (as is the entire film), which highlights the attributes of the film's star - Tony Leung Chiu-Wai.  Ip Man is portrayed as a cool, calculating, and absolutely confident in his skills - all of which are lightning quick, not to mention lethal.The most outstanding element of this film (behind the acting of Tony Leung) is the soundtrack, composed by Shigeru Umebayashi, Nathaniel M&eacute;chaly and Stefano Lentini.  With so many different details in modern films, the music has lost a great deal of recognition - unless it includes a big name musician singing a song at the end of the credits.  It seems to be a rarity that music score stands out, but in this case, the music sets the tone for this film.  From the Chinese opera to the exquisite themes throughout, the music contributes the constant shift in mood and tone.  Most film scores are simply average, but this particular film thrives largely because of such an emotional musical composition - so much so that it wouldn't be the worst idea to add this soundtrack to your music collection (assuming you're into classical music).Over the years, there have been several interpretations of Ip Man's life, including a handful of popular films, including Ip Man, and Ip Man 2 - not to mention several TV projects.  This film focuses on the intertwining characters that defined the important moments of Ip Man's life.  Thankfully, it balances dramatic turmoil with a significant amount of action - which should be enough to attract causal fans of martial art combat.  Although the film is choppy and quick paced (from year to year), it has the ability to briefly enlighten movie-goers about the man responsible for training an entire generation of martial artists - one of which is Bruce Lee.  However, Lee's characterization in this film is brief and only as a child, so those hoping to see that portion of Ip Man's life will be disappointed.  Regardless, if this film had to be described by using only one word, the word would be elegant.  And, if nothing else - The Grandmaster will show you the importance of a button (yes, a button).GRADE:  C+FNDNreview.com",3,'The Grandmaster' an elegant film - but not for everyone.,1378944000,"09 12,

With the understanding that during the early part of the 20th Century, multiple dialects were used in China along with numerous different currencies. One of the first things that Mao accomplished was to unify currency and language. However, for the intent of the movie, I felt it would have been better if they used one dialect for the dialogue.

The Grandmaster has some breathtaking action, sure, but it is first and foremost a drama, but it's a good one, so hopefully that won't be an issue for you. A lot has been said in these reviews of the difference between the Chinese and American cuts of the film. I have watched both many, many times, and while I prefer the original, the American edit is also very good. It is more streamlined, plot-wise, has some scenes in a different order for the sake of clarity, and more/different voiceover and exposition. Each version includes some footage that the other does not, but the Chinese cut is longer overall. I wish both versions had been included on the American blu ray release, but they were not. I'm hoping they'll release a &#34;director's cut&#34; or &#34;international version&#34; at some point, but I'm not holding my breath.

However, Ip says that Wing chuan has a master and a student; the master reflects what he sees in the student, sensitivity.  Ip admires the reflection of the 64 hands movement.  Ip is from a wealth family from Foshan, in the South.  He is selected to fight the grandmaster from the North.  He wins the duel, but must fight the daughter, who is not recognized by the martial art community.  Ip has a gift.  He is not a proponent of internal energy system.  However, he does know how to beat them. Interesting.The movie centers on the preservation of the Gong family's system.  The Monkey turning back is the ultimate secret, the surprise counter, of the family system.  Advance forward is the motto but not the secret.  The daughter must challenge to restore honor.  Ma San claims successorship of the Gong family martial art system, bagua.  Ma San collaborates with the enemy.  In the final fight Ma San advances with his canon fist, but loses to Gong Er, as the monkey turns back. Gong Er suffers from her injuries and turns to opium.  Gong Er becomes a doctor. Ip visits her and tells Gong Er that he cares for her and hopes to see her perform 64 hands, again.  He tells Gong Er that her father would want her to keep the faith.Ip sees and experiences the loses of war.  The movie highlights the suffering during the Japanese imperial expansion policies of the 30s and 40s. Three million starve to death.  It is a sad and remorseful time.  A time when world powers believed in their supremacy and their domain.

1644951,AR08EBGEEVE28,B00C9G22R2,"Harold Holt ""Soulwriter""","[7, 19]","I will keep this review/opinion succinct.  Among viewers of Asian cinema, there exists hardcore martial arts fans and fans of cinematic Asian art-house. I consider myself a member of the former, so please keep that in mind as you read this review. Trailers for THE GRANDMASTER will mislead many martial arts fans into thinking that it is a kick-ass martial arts movie that adds to the developing canon of films depicting the life of Bruce Lee's teacher IP MAN. In actuality, this film is a sizable chunk of Asian art-house with an historical focus. IP MAN just happens to be one of the characters in the film.Anyone looking for action and knockdown-dragout fights in the vein of Donnie Yen's IP MAN films will be devestatingly disappointed. The actions sequences in this film are very few, very scarce, and nothing at all spectacular. Not only is the IP MAN character absent from a large chunk of the film, but we are not even offered any kind of final epic fight at the end. None of the film's skirmishes are at all lengthy.I am not an idiot who only watches wall-to-wall bloody action. I understand that this film was intended as historical and philosophical drama and high-end art--I understand that after having seen it. But had I known that from the start, I probably would not have bought this film at the WizardWorld comic book convention in Rosemont. I believe Director Martin Scorsese has agreed to officially present this film for American distribution, and given the type of historical and epic scope the film illustrates, I can see and understand Scorsese's appreciation of its beauty. I am not a hater of the arts and I certainly recognize that this film was not intended to be a Shaw Brother-type of escapist action. However, the trailers present the film as exactly that, and I think many fans of the Shaw Brothers escapist fun--such as myself, will feel very cheated after sitting through this film.So to conclude, if you are into artsy foreign films, you may find much to love about this movie. But if, like me, you just want some great and spectacular, death-defying battles, with unbelievable stunts, bad dubbing and mad blue-screen effects, don't waste your time on this long, talky, forlorn flick.",1,The Sleepmaster: The Fist of Boredom,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,2218,"['will', 'keep', 'review/opinion', 'succinct', 'viewers', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'hardcore', 'martial', 'arts', 'fans', 'fans', 'cinematic', 'Asian', 'art-house', 'consider', 'member', 'former', 'so', 'please', 'keep', 'mind', 'read', 'review', 'Trailers', 'GRANDMASTER', 'will', 'mislead', 'many', 'martial', 'arts', 'fans', 'thinking', 'kick-ass', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'developing', 'canon', 'films', 'depicting', 'life', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'teacher', 'IP', 'MAN', 'actuality', 'film', 'sizable', 'chunk', 'Asian', 'art-house', 'historical', 'focus', 'IP', 'MAN', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'characters', 'film.Anyone', 'looking', 'action', 'knockdown-dragout', 'fights', 'vein', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'IP', 'MAN', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'devestatingly', 'disappointed', 'actions', 'sequences', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'very', 'scarce', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'Not', 'only', 'IP', 'MAN', 'character', 'absent', 'large', 'chunk', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'offered', 'kind', 'final', 'epic', 'fight', 'end', 'None', 'film', 'skirmishes', 'are', 'lengthy.I', 'am', 'not', 'idiot', 'who', 'only', 'wall-to-wall', 'bloody', 'action', 'understand', 'film', 'was', 'intended', 'historical', 'philosophical', 'drama', 'high-end', 'art', 'understand', 'having', 'seen', 'had', 'known', 'start', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'bought', 'film', 'WizardWorld', 'comic', 'book', 'convention', 'Rosemont', 'believe', 'Director', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'agreed', 'officially', 'present', 'film', 'American', 'distribution', 'given', 'type', 'historical', 'epic', 'scope', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'understand', 'Scorsese', 'appreciation', 'beauty', 'am', 'not', 'hater', 'arts', 'certainly', 'recognize', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'Shaw', 'Brother-type', 'escapist', 'action', 'However', 'trailers', 'present', 'film', 'exactly', 'think', 'many', 'fans', 'Shaw', 'Brothers', 'escapist', 'fun', 'such', 'will', 'feel', 'very', 'cheated', 'sitting', 'film.So', 'conclude', 'are', 'artsy', 'foreign', 'films', 'may', 'find', 'much', 'love', 'movie', 'just', 'want', 'great', 'spectacular', 'death-defying', 'battles', 'unbelievable', 'stunts', 'bad', 'dubbing', 'mad', 'blue-screen', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'long', 'talky', 'forlorn', 'flick']",THE Grandmaster with Tony Leung

1644953,A10H47FMW8NHII,B00C9G22R2,"Jay B. Lane ""professional audience member""","[3, 3]","Make no mistake, when a film is directed by Wong Kar Wai (""2041""), it will be artistic no matter what audience expectations may be. Naturally he includes martial arts, but as we already know, most martial art films depend heavily on visual and audio editing. Remember ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" with the gravity-defying action? There is a bit of that here as well. But the visual editing is perfection: each scene is framed with loving care and a careful eye.The film is loaded with Eastern aphorisms which floated in one ear and out the other, although I liked the one about two martial elements: horizontal and vertical. If you are vertical at the end of a bout... you won. Even I can understand THAT one!Along with the visual excellence I always expect from this director, I had the pleasure of watching two of my favorite Asian actors:* Tony Leung (""In the Mood for Love"") is Ip Man, our martial arts master who, after fundamental changes and loss in his life, eventually ends up in Hong Kong and establishes the school where Bruce Lee trains.* Ziyi Zhang (""Memoirs of a Geisha"") is Gong Er, the gifted daughter of a martial arts grandmaster who had the misfortune to be born female. She is the master of a specialized school of martial arts but swears to never disclose her secrets.If you have been lucky enough to see ""In the Mood for Love"" you know not to expect gunshots or sweaty bodies but you also know there will be an achingly poignant love story. The sound track has a touch of western music that we recognize, plus some eastern pieces, as well.We see our star-crossed lovers as they and their families are caught up in the invasion of China by the Japanese, WW II and a sea change in the way Hong Kong is governed. We see starvation and cruelty, elegance and beauty, i.e., the full panoply of Far Eastern history in the mid-1900s.And those actors are STILL two of my favorites!

1644968,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00C9G22R2,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","I'm just now catching up on this recent film by Kar Wai Wong.  The last film of his that I saw was ""2046"" which I didn't like.  ""The Grandmaster"" is yet another film about Ip Man (born Yip Kai-man) who was a student and master of the Wing Chun style of Kung Fu.  Bruce Lee was his best known pupil.This film begins in 1936 just prior to WW II and a Japanese invasion is likely.  Recognizing the northern region of China should be more compatible with the southern region, Master Gong Yutian (Quigxiang Wang) takes his confederates to their leader.  As was apparently the custom at the time, Gong solicits a challenge from the best of the south.  This turns out to be Ip Man (Tony Leung).  The challenge isn't a fight however, it is to crack a cookie in half being held by Gong.  Ip Man manages somehow to do it using some hand gestures and swift movements.  A rematch is scheduled but Gong sends his daughter, Gong Er (Ziyi Zhang) instead.  In one of the sexiest Kung Fu fights I've ever seen, Ip and Er engage in a Kung Fu ballet of style and ferocity, where Er even seems to take flight.  This isn't blood sport.  It is to see who can win without breaking anything in the house.  It is totally mesmerizing.  In fact, I found the whole movie to be mesmerizing.In the film's opening scene we see Ip in one of those battles against hordes of attackers during a rainstorm.  For a minute I was thinking, didn't I just see this in ""Raid 2""?  Well, yes and no.  Sure the rain provides an excellent opportunity to show off the fighting skills, but this isn't head cracking, blood spurting violence.  It's beautifully choreographed by the great Yuen Woo-ping (""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"").  The film is beautifully shot by Phillipe Le Sourd providing visual eye candy throughout.  The film is loaded with great color and includes an amazing soundtrack by Stefano Lentini.  Bits of orchestral flourishes and operatic arias add a certain sophistication and grace to the fights.  Trust me, it all works.I would be remise by not mentioning the great fight scene between Er and Razor (Chen Chang).  Razor was Gong Yutian's pupil and adopted son.  When Razor turned on his Master, he also took his title and his home.  So a big showdown features the two, dressed in winter finery, duking it out in a snowstorm beside a speeding train.  Another beautifully created scene.As much as I like this film, it is a bit confusing in terms of the narrative.  I suspect something is lost in the cultural translation, but it may also be because this film runs about 22 minutes shorter than the original Chinese release.  This film shares a conceptual beauty with Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  If you liked that film, you'll like this one.  Highly Recommended.I did watch this movie on Blu ray which does not include the original 130 minute version.  It looks great.  Shot using a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and the usual 1080p resolution, I have no complaints.  The detail is excellent.  The multicolored Chinese clothing produces examples of clarity and contrast.  Black levels are good.  I will admit to being wowed by the film itself and may have missed some mistakes, but none I could remember.  The audio is even better.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 in Mandarin is dramatically better than the Dolby Digital 5.1 English dubbed track.  Go with the DTS.  The English subtitles are easy to read.  Other subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.  You will get a sense of the quality of the audio in the aforementioned early fight scene.

The faulty philosophies which seemed to only contribute to defeat and denial frustrated me. Each person who was supposedly &#34;undefeated&#34; in their field, were immediately defeated in the next breath due to the imposition of an outside factor which actually had nothing to do with the actual challenge. The continuous intrusion of abounding pride, thinly veiled by elaborate pretension of humility caused each one to be categorically blind to personal flaws of judgment and skill, as well as ignorant of any analysis regarding deeper motivational forces of their opponent. Through overweening pride and inability to reach past their own skin, each one suffered far greater personal loss, permanent loss, than any brought about by the actual outcome of a match.

VERSION!It was finally time for the great iconoclastic Hong Kong director to turn to martial arts action in his intense and atmospheric telling of the great grandmaster teacher, Ip man, and he doesn't disappoint.Wong Kar-wai brings the poetic beauty of his cinematic genius displayed in such works as ""In the Mood for Love"" to martial arts action executed with a precise rhythmic heightening reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah at his best, bringing out the sensations of living through the Japanese invasion of China during WWII. The cast is magnificent, especially Tony Leung as the Ip man, and Ziyi Zhang as Gong Er perfectly embodies a kungfu mistress trying to avenge her father. A masterpiece by Wong to put on a level with his finest work.My only gripe about this Blu-ray release (which looks stunning in its clarity of picture and color, highlighting Wong's penchant for rain and darkness) is that the special features (unlike the feature itself) do not have any English subtitling -- so unless you read Chinese you won't be able to know what Wong or his crew and cast are talking about.  The feature does, however, have full subtitling.A worthy addition to your Blu-ray library.PS: One other reviewer criticized the editing of this film which, to me, smacks of putting down the film for not being more conventional.  Sometimes it is difficult to put aside expectations of what one wants a film to be in favor of what the actual film on the screen is.  ""The Grandmaster"" is, in fact, brilliantly edited.  Wong is, if nothing else, a perfectionist in taking years to mold his assembled footage into his own personal rhythmic poem, idiosyncratically emphasizing downbeats and rests as precise as a great composer.  What you see here is Wong Kar-wai's personal vision, take it or leave it.  But let's not denigrate it for not being a conventional action picture or someone else's Ip man film.  I wouldn't change a frame, or a single edit.

With this incredible fight scene director Kar Wai Wong opens The Grandmaster.Then Wong replicates the same techniques over and over again ad nauseam, expecting fancy camera angles and beautiful set designs to carry an entire 90-minute feature. The result, a film where absolutely nothing happens.Phillipe le Sourd&#8217;s cinematography here resembles that of Christopher Doyle&#8217;s in Hero (2002). That is to say, it&#8217;s amazing, but just in case we didn&#8217;t recognize its amazingness in the first scene, the second scene, or even the tenth scene, Director Wong insists that we better recognize. Wong pummels the viewer to death with le Sourd&#8217;s blazing techniques. Identical shot after identical shot render le Sourd&#8217;s imagery utterly meaningless.This film stars the great of Zizi Zhang of Crouching Tiger (2000) and Hero fame. Here she plays a supporting character, and, oh yeah, is totally wasted as an actress. The disorganized mess of direction spends more time showing slow motion side angles of her pretty face than probably any other single device in the film. Zhang&#8217;s combat is graceful as always, but this gets boring fast as there is no discernable purpose to all her fighting.The main character Ip Man flees whatever Chinese town he&#8217;s from as the crisis of a Japanese invasion occurs, but we don&#8217;t even care. Eventually Zhang&#8217;s character and Ip Man magically meet up in Hong Kong, but by this point, thanks to the miasmic mess that has spewed fourth since the beginning of the film, the only think we do care about as viewers is the amount of time left until the credits roll.Get more reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",1,Beautiful waste of time,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,1822,"['Rains', 'drops', 'shine', 'diamonds', 'choreographed', 'battle', 'dance', 'graceful', 'powerful', 'movement', 'violence', 'beautiful', 'incredible', 'fight', 'scene', 'director', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Wong', 'Grandmaster.Then', 'Wong', 'same', 'techniques', 'over', 'again', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'expecting', 'fancy', 'camera', 'angles', 'beautiful', 'set', 'designs', 'carry', 'entire', '90-minute', 'feature', 'result', 'film', 'where', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'happens.Phillipe', 'le', 'Sourd', '8217', 'cinematography', 'here', 'Christopher', 'Doyle', '8217', 's', 'Hero', '2002', 'say', '8217', 'amazing', 'just', 'case', 'didn', '8217', 'recognize', 'amazingness', 'first', 'scene', 'second', 'scene', 'even', 'tenth', 'scene', 'Director', 'Wong', 'better', 'recognize', 'Wong', 'viewer', 'death', 'le', 'Sourd', '8217', 'blazing', 'techniques', 'Identical', 'shot', 'identical', 'shot', 'render', 'le', 'Sourd', '8217', 'imagery', 'utterly', 'meaningless.This', 'film', 'great', 'Zizi', 'Zhang', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', '2000', 'Hero', 'fame', 'Here', 'supporting', 'character', 'oh', 'yeah', 'totally', 'wasted', 'actress', 'disorganized', 'mess', 'direction', 'spends', 'more', 'time', 'showing', 'slow', 'motion', 'side', 'angles', 'pretty', 'face', 'probably', 'other', 'single', 'device', 'film', 'Zhang', '8217', 'combat', 'graceful', 'always', 'boring', 'fast', 'discernable', 'purpose', 'fighting.The', 'main', 'character', 'Ip', 'Man', 'Chinese', 'town', '8217', 's', 'crisis', 'Japanese', 'invasion', 'don', '8217', 't', 'even', 'care', 'Eventually', 'Zhang', '8217', 'character', 'Ip', 'Man', 'magically', 'up', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'point', 'thanks', 'miasmic', 'mess', 'spewed', 'fourth', 'beginning', 'film', 'only', 'think', 'do', 'care', 'viewers', 'amount', 'time', 'left', 'credits', 'roll.Get', 'more', 'reviews', 'getthebonesaw.blogspot.com']",THE Grandmaster with Tony Leung

His latest film chronicles the life of Yip Man, a legendary martial arts master who had become internationally famous by a 2008 Donnie Yen film. (It took about eight years for director Kar Wai Wong to complete the film since he announced his intention of making this film in 2004.)""The Grandmaster"" begins with beautifully shot martial arts sequence of Wing Chun master Ip Man (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai) and his foes (choreographed by Yuen Woo-ping). You will soon realize, however, that the director does not really intend to make an action film.During the fight scene that is set in dark rainy night, every single shot is meticulously framed and perfected to the point where, with so many slow motions and close-ups, the film's highly stylized ""action"" sequences are less dynamic and more graceful than those in Donnie Yen films.Kar Wai Wong, it is clear, wants to put emphasis on Ip Man and other martial arts fighters as a person, including Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang), a retired martial arts master from northern China, and his daughter and martial arts fighter Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi). She is romantically attracted to Ip Man, who is a married man.I know storytelling is not Kar Wai Wong's forte, but the film's narrative is too uneven and disjointed, making some of the interesting characters such as Ip Man's wife (terribly wasted Song Hye-kyo) virtually invisible. Not only that; at certain points the film itself has almost become a story about Gong Er. Well, I didn't mind that, but I thought this film is about Ip Man.After all, this is a film made by Kar Wai Wong, director renowned for his visual style. With action scenes that look more like dance scenes, his latest film will satisfy his avid fans, but for those who are interested in action or Ip Man himself as a person, the film is ""The Grandmaster"" is a little disappointing.Beautiful",3,Visually Striking But Not Exactly a Martial Arts Movie,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,1942,"['Grandmaster', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Wong', 'first', 'film', 'six', 'years', 'Blueberry', 'Nights', 'latest', 'film', 'life', 'Yip', 'Man', 'legendary', 'martial', 'arts', 'master', 'who', 'had', 'become', 'internationally', 'famous', '2008', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'film', 'took', 'about', 'eight', 'years', 'director', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Wong', 'complete', 'film', 'announced', 'intention', 'making', 'film', '2004', 'Grandmaster', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'martial', 'arts', 'sequence', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'master', 'Ip', 'Man', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Chiu-Wai', 'foes', 'choreographed', 'Yuen', 'Woo-ping', 'will', 'soon', 'realize', 'however', 'director', 'not', 'really', 'intend', 'make', 'action', 'film.During', 'fight', 'scene', 'set', 'dark', 'rainy', 'night', 'single', 'shot', 'meticulously', 'framed', 'perfected', 'point', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'slow', 'motions', 'close-ups', 'film', 'highly', 'stylized', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'less', 'dynamic', 'more', 'graceful', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'films.Kar', 'Wai', 'Wong', 'clear', 'put', 'emphasis', 'Ip', 'Man', 'other', 'martial', 'arts', 'fighters', 'person', 'including', 'Gong', 'Yutian', 'Wang', 'Qingxiang', 'retired', 'martial', 'arts', 'master', 'northern', 'China', 'daughter', 'martial', 'arts', 'fighter', 'Gong', 'Er', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'romantically', 'attracted', 'Ip', 'Man', 'who', 'married', 'man.I', 'know', 'storytelling', 'not', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Wong', 'forte', 'film', 'narrative', 'too', 'uneven', 'disjointed', 'making', 'interesting', 'characters', 'such', 'Ip', 'Man', 'wife', 'terribly', 'wasted', 'Song', 'Hye-kyo', 'virtually', 'invisible', 'Not', 'only', 'certain', 'points', 'film', 'almost', 'become', 'story', 'Gong', 'Er', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'thought', 'film', 'Ip', 'Man.After', 'all', 'film', 'made', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Wong', 'director', 'renowned', 'visual', 'style', 'action', 'scenes', 'look', 'more', 'like', 'dance', 'scenes', 'latest', 'film', 'will', 'satisfy', 'avid', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'action', 'Ip', 'Man', 'person', 'film', 'Grandmaster', 'little', 'disappointing.Beautiful']",THE Grandmaster with Tony Leung

I have a large collection of foriegn films with most of them originating in Asia, and this film moves into my top 10 of historical action / drama.  If you've haven't seen ""IP MAN"" 1-4, then I suggest watch those first before you  see a semi matserpiece like ""Grandmaster"".  You may see mixed reviews for GRANDMASTER, but that is due to martial arts actor Donnie Yen setting the bar so high for martial arts action in IP MAN 1&2.  IP MAN films 1&2 where higly inaccurate in regards to the history of Yip Man, but was quit entertaining due to the skills Donnie Yen executed on screen.  Wont talk to much about IP MAN 3&4 because you want to hear about GRANDMASTER, but they wereok films to watch.  GRANDMASTER had more then enough fignht seens in it to establish itself as a great martial arts film.  The fight scenes portray the proper artistic execution of kung fu, and do not shy of creativity.  The acting is executed with perfection, and i really didn't expect it.  The only issue I have with the film is that it seems to jump all over the place sometimes, but this is probably due to me watch the IP MAN series.What I will say next DOES NOT reflect this specific DVD from this seller.

What this should have been is a superior update of Jimmy Wang Yu's CHINESE PROFESSIONALS.Instead it become a self absorbed pseudo Greek tragedy, replete with characters doomed to die before they complete their life's mission, with little to offer other than depth of field photography and way too freaking much slow motion employed during the curiously vague and unimaginative fight scenes.There's a boat load of interesting characters, including an imposing fighter who uses a barber's razor to inflict severe pain and death upon his opponents. He is quickly dispatched with what appears to be a nail with a chain attached, and he's gone from the film. WHAT!??

1645006,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B00C9G22R2,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[1, 1]","I suppose being Bruce Lee's former teacher and someone who had made the martial art Wing Chun known around the world, the curiosity around his life became so strong that director Wilson Yip and Herman Yau had their turn in bringing his life to the big screen. Wilson Yip's ""Ip Man"" was a film with a lot of fiction around it, which focused entirely on action sequences with Donnie Yen in the title role. Herman Yau's ""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"" was an unspectacular martial arts drama but a little more subtle and certainly not as bombastic as Wilson Yip's films. Please take note that Wong Kar-Wai's rendition of Master Ip's life was never meant as a martial arts action flick.Well, finally the highly anticipated film about Ip Man directed by Wong Kar-Wai has finally arrived. A little different from his usual films, as the film goes for refreshing ideas and themes rather than decadent emotions, it is a film that has a lot of hype as with any other film directed by him. People should be aware that one needs to temper their expectations with Wong Kar-Wai's ""The Grandmaster"". It is a film about a true-to-life figure and is a period piece that brings the concept of how martial arts can apply to living. Wong Kar-Wai takes on a premise that he has not done before that his fans would have reason to celebrate. This review is based on the 130 minute film released in Asia, I have heard that another cut of the film was debuted internationally.1930s China. Ip Man (Tony Leung) is a rich, young martial arts master who does not want to compete and yet he finds himself thrust into the limelight as his peers push him into a sparring match with Chinese Martial Arts chairman Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang). The match was more technical than a display of skills as Ip Man asserts his inner will to get the best of Yutian. As a result, Yutian's daughter, Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi)  who is also a master in her own right of the 64 hands, issues a challenge to Master Ip as to restore her family's reputation. The two spar in a flow of rhythmic movements that almost looked like poetry. This is only the first few minutes of the film, as Wong Kar-Wai co-wrote the screenplay to include certain periods in Ip Man's life. If life has four seasons, then the first 20 years is spring, but then his life takes a turn to winter during the Sino-Japanese war.Wong Kar-Wai intentionally made the film to feel rather convoluted and episodic. Perhaps in an effort to express his themes and metaphors, and to cover as much of Ip Man's life as best he could. Wong does not primarily takes his focus on Master Ip's life, but rather he brings into the fold the way each period was in his life and how certain people have influenced his life both directly and indirectly. The writing in the film was definitely trying to bring forth the concept as to how the teachings of martial arts could be applied to the living of one's life, as Tony Leung clearly elaborates in the first few minutes in the film; ""It is all about the horizontal and the vertical"". I take it that one is left standing while the other is laying down in martial arts. Such is something that could certainly be seen in life. One stands while the other lays down, perhaps one needs to learn how to lay down in order to stand, and also at a mirror image, one needs to learn to lay down in order to stand.Wong Kar-Wai has some rather heavy themes going around here. There is much to take in the film, the dialogue is often filled with philosophical expressions and metaphors, but we all know that it is usually what a Wong Kar-Wai movie is all about. The characters in the film move about its themes, and while its structure felt a little loose, the resonance for each of them is pretty crystal clear. Ma San (Zhang Jin) and Gong Er make choices that often feel that they were based on emotions such as pride, anger, honor and love. The theme of vengeance that comes with the two, was something that keeps them from fully reaching the peak of kung fu. This brings into its narrative as to there are three levels that signify the highest achievement in martial arts: ""being, knowing and doing."" This lesson comes from Master Gong to Ma San, and strongly expressed through Gong Er's life that she had taken a vow that kept her from becoming a wife and having children in order to avenge her father. Ma San and Gong Er chooses from a very straight-forward emotional level that chooses their destiny for them.Now, Master Ip also has potential for all these emotions, but he is more passive. His approach to life is a more peaceful one, as his love for Gong Er remained inside and that such a thing could not be in the past. Master Ip is married to Wing Sing (Song Hye-Kyo in a limited screen time) while Gong Er was engaged. Ip Man choose to rise above such desires and ambition, that he approaches life from a less than aggrandizing path. There is a subtle subversive message around its narrative, and yet it sees things from a humanist point of view. Life has its regrets, and yet, here, it is not something that drives its narrative but merely a consequence. Wong places the film's priorities on the world around the individual rather than what the individual does to the world.As with Wong Kar-wai's usual style, the film is very lush and a little pretentious. This is not a negative comment, but rather something that I have just grown to be fond of when it came to Wong's films. Wong uses slow-motion with overblown art direction and redolent details to bring the power, the beauty and the flair of the martial arts. All angles were utilized to display the moves and even some close ups to bring forth its effects and intensity. It is a true visual feast but I could've done without the `fighting in the rain' since it had been done so much in other films. The cinematography and the atmosphere of the film fit just should be expected of Wong Kar-Wai; this is after all a style all his own and what made him the renowned filmmaker that he is today.The screenplay in ""The Grandmaster"" is pretty strong, and yet it does not come with some issues. I mean, I know this is meant as a biopic, but one is left to wonder if this is Ip Man as seen through his eyes, or is it Master Ip as seen through Wong's viewpoint? I know the film's intentions was a less than fictional one, but really, it feels a little unfocused at times. The script takes some detours that I thought unnecessary, I was a little dumbfounded how a nationalist agent turned ass-kicking barber called ""the Razor"" could've made a good device to further Ip Man's transitions and yet he was only in three scenes. Chang Chen's the Razor was shamelessly used and felt like a `filler' since the film could've gotten along fine without him. I also thought that the narrative played a little too heavy on Zhang Ziyi's character rather than its supposed main protagonist.""The Grandmaster"" could've easily been called ""The Grandmasters"" as in the plural form. It feels little unfocused to be a biopic on Master Ip, and truth be told, its messages could've easily been delivered in a film by any other director about a martial artist's journey experiencing the same things in the world. Tony Leung does a great job as the lead, as he felt a little smug and yet, tempered. Stoic, yet filled with emotions. His performance was certainly better than Donnie Yen's. It was also great to see Zhang Ziyi to once again do her thing; she was elegant, beautiful and graceful as always. Despite some flaws, ""The Grandmaster"" is a good film that deals with piety, humility and humanist ideas, and rather than using love as a driving force, it is a mere upshot.  It is about just what it means to stand upright, that how one chooses the right path is often the one left standing. This message is truly complete and grown-up that this film gets a High Recommendation from me.
