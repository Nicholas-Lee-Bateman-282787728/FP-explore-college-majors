Just way too much explanation that leads to the heart rate coming down too much, and the supposedly inspirational comments I found to be completely cheesy. Kind of bugs me though, because had it been better edited, I would have given it maybe 4 stars. The other issue is that it doesn't really get going until the ""core"" section, so I will just avoid the ""punches"" section completely in future (1st of 4 segments). That said, there are some interesting moves in here, and towards the mid to end it gets much better. I will probably use it in future for light days when I don't feel like doing too much - for a kickboxing routine it's pretty laid back. Not to say you won't get your heart rate up a bit, but just not a ""normal"" kickboxing workout. Would have been good with a music only option. I think people making these DVDs forget that they are going to be used over and over, and this just increases the irritation level of all the unnecessary explanations that you can't easily skip...the moves were mostly straightforward and an intro section would easily cover it for newbies.",3,Put the talk in the intro!,1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,1139,"['could', 'say', 'ditto', 'review', 'Chrevolet67Impala', 'Just', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'explanation', 'heart', 'rate', 'coming', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'supposedly', 'inspirational', 'comments', 'found', 'be', 'completely', 'cheesy', 'Kind', 'bugs', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'edited', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'maybe', '4', 'stars', 'other', 'issue', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'going', 'core', 'section', 'will', 'just', 'avoid', 'punches', 'section', 'completely', 'future', '1st', '4', 'segments', 'said', 'are', 'interesting', 'moves', 'here', 'mid', 'end', 'much', 'better', 'will', 'probably', 'use', 'future', 'light', 'days', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'doing', 'too', 'much', 'kickboxing', 'routine', 'pretty', 'laid', 'back', 'Not', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'bit', 'just', 'not', 'normal', 'kickboxing', 'workout', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'music', 'only', 'option', 'think', 'people', 'making', 'DVDs', 'forget', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'used', 'just', 'irritation', 'level', 'unnecessary', 'explanations', 'ca', ""n't"", 'easily', 'skip', 'moves', 'were', 'mostly', 'straightforward', 'intro', 'section', 'would', 'easily', 'cover', 'newbies']",Kickbox - Core Cross Train

The most irratating part, is that you don't have to listen to her telling you to give a 100% once, but over and over again throughout the DVD.  And then each time you watch it too.

1120878,A3HYA534VB3F2S,B000YV1L6M,"Althetrainer ""Al""","[0, 0]","We have tried a few other kickboxing DVDs and this is the one we liked.  Honestly, none of these ""kickboxing"" exercise DVDs really teach you how to do kickboxing.  It's more like the instructor strung up a series of kickboxing moves to create a workout for you to break a sweat.I actually like the instructor, she's pretty clear about what she wants you to do next.  Her cues are not perfect but compared to some other kickbox instructors I gave her 4 out of 5 stars.  My husband is the most uncoordinated person and he usually has a hard time with exercise DVDs.  He actually likes Moreno and he can follow all the punches and part of the kicks even on day one.Some people complain Moreno talked too much and there were too many talking breaks.  Personally I think it's a good thing for people without a lot of kicking and punching experience.  In order to punch and kick correctly (without hurting yourself) one must learn how to create a solid base and to utilize the core.  Trying to keep up with all the combinations is challenging enough for beginners, let alone keeping properly body position.  Moreno's constant cues remind me to keep my core engaged for a proper and injury-free workout.The first time I did this workout I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the moves so I didn't break a sweat.  The second time I did it I was able to keep up with the combination and I really sweated this time.  So if you have tried it once and it didn't seem to be a good workout, don't give up on it just yet.I do have a minor complaint about this DVD.  There are four parts of this exercise DVD: Punches, Core Energizer, Kicks, and Combination.  The first time I viewed this DVD I couldn't get Punches and Core Energizer to play.  When I tried ""play all"" it went straight to the Kicks part then continued on to Combination.  I tried clicking on the ""Punches"" part directly but it kept taking me back to the main menu screen.  I really thought I had a defective DVD and that we're missing two out of four parts.  But on the third day I made another attempt and this time the Punches began to play.  As of today, the scene selection is still unreliable but at least now I know if I keep clicking on Punches it will eventually play.  I like long workout and I wish the combination was a bit longer. I have already learned all the punches and kicks, I would like to go straight to Combination for a good workout  But the combination part is very short.  It felt like that I have just gotten into the rhythm then the workout was over.",4,A decent workout DVD,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,2532,"['have', 'tried', 'few', 'other', 'kickboxing', 'DVDs', 'one', 'liked', 'Honestly', 'none', 'kickboxing', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'really', 'teach', 'how', 'do', 'kickboxing', 'more', 'instructor', 'strung', 'up', 'series', 'kickboxing', 'moves', 'create', 'workout', 'break', 'sweat.I', 'actually', 'instructor', 'pretty', 'clear', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'cues', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'compared', 'other', 'kickbox', 'instructors', 'gave', '4', '5', 'stars', 'husband', 'most', 'uncoordinated', 'person', 'usually', 'hard', 'time', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'actually', 'Moreno', 'can', 'follow', 'punches', 'part', 'kicks', 'even', 'day', 'one.Some', 'people', 'complain', 'Moreno', 'talked', 'too', 'much', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'talking', 'breaks', 'Personally', 'think', 'good', 'thing', 'people', 'lot', 'kicking', 'punching', 'experience', 'order', 'punch', 'kick', 'correctly', 'hurting', 'one', 'must', 'learn', 'how', 'create', 'solid', 'base', 'utilize', 'core', 'Trying', 'keep', 'up', 'combinations', 'challenging', 'enough', 'beginners', 'let', 'alone', 'keeping', 'properly', 'body', 'position', 'Moreno', 'constant', 'cues', 'remind', 'keep', 'core', 'engaged', 'proper', 'injury-free', 'workout.The', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'workout', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'moves', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'break', 'sweat', 'second', 'time', 'did', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'combination', 'really', 'sweated', 'time', 'So', 'have', 'tried', 'once', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'good', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'just', 'yet.I', 'do', 'have', 'minor', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'are', 'four', 'parts', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'Punches', 'Core', 'Energizer', 'Kicks', 'Combination', 'first', 'time', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'Punches', 'Core', 'Energizer', 'play', 'When', 'tried', 'play', 'went', 'straight', 'Kicks', 'part', 'then', 'continued', 'Combination', 'tried', 'clicking', 'Punches', 'part', 'directly', 'kept', 'taking', 'back', 'main', 'menu', 'screen', 'really', 'thought', 'had', 'defective', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'missing', 'two', 'four', 'parts', 'third', 'day', 'made', 'attempt', 'time', 'Punches', 'began', 'play', 'today', 'scene', 'selection', 'still', 'unreliable', 'least', 'now', 'know', 'keep', 'clicking', 'Punches', 'will', 'eventually', 'play', 'like', 'long', 'workout', 'wish', 'combination', 'was', 'bit', 'longer', 'have', 'already', 'learned', 'punches', 'kicks', 'would', 'like', 'go', 'straight', 'Combination', 'good', 'workout', 'combination', 'part', 'very', 'short', 'felt', 'have', 'just', 'gotten', 'rhythm', 'then', 'workout', 'was', 'over']",Kickbox - Core Cross Train

Schneider,"[6, 6]","As I am always on the lookout for a new workout and instructors to motivate me I had my local library order this for me so I could take it for a test run.  This one is definitely on my wish list now.  Though some could find Patricia's style too chatty, I thought she had the perfect blend of motivation without constantly talking.  She cues the moves well and has good form.  The scenery is beautiful with red rocks in the background, shot in Snow Canyon, Utah.  The music was fitting to the work-out in my opinion and had a good beat.  I have done some Kickbox workouts before and I would say as far as challenging kickbox moves I'd say no, but challenging for my core and working my lower body....absolutely.  If you are looking for an advanced ""kickboxing"" workout though, this may not be what you are looking for.  The emphasis here is on cross training and your core.The workout has several sections, punches (about 13 minutes),core training (about 25 minutes), kicks (about 18 minutes), Combo/Cooldown (9/5 minutes), and an additional bonus workout (about 14 minutes).The first time I did the workout I did punches & core training and stretched on my own after (there is no extensive cool down until the last segment of the dvd, so I would recommend extra stretching on your own).  The next day I did kicks, combo and the bonus. At the end of the week I tried all segments together, making an 80 minute plus workout.I exercise daily, doing a variety of work-outs-Salsa, Aerobic, Tae-Bo, Yoga, Pilates, etc.  and though I thought at first this wouldn't challenge me enough, I found the pace to be aerobic and though the moves weren't hard, the workout definitely kept my heart rate up and worked muscles that I obviously had not recently worked this hard.  I most definitely felt my muscles even after a couple days after that first workout (core, butt, arms, and inner thigh).One caution is to be careful while doing on carpet where you are pivoting you will need to be mindful of not twisting your knee.In the bonus section, I would caution if you have wrist problems as this section is primarily variations of yoga's ""plank"" position (looks like the beginning of a push up).  I am very familiar with plank as it is part of my yoga practice, but still felt her variations were challenging and will build strong and shapely arms (Who doesn't want that?).Overall, an excellent workout.  I would definitely purchase this item and will also be looking to try more of Patricia's dvds in the future.",5,plenty of lower body and core training....,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,2500,"['am', 'always', 'lookout', 'new', 'workout', 'instructors', 'motivate', 'had', 'local', 'library', 'order', 'could', 'take', 'test', 'run', 'one', 'definitely', 'wish', 'list', 'now', 'could', 'find', 'Patricia', 'style', 'too', 'chatty', 'thought', 'had', 'perfect', 'blend', 'motivation', 'constantly', 'talking', 'moves', 'well', 'good', 'form', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'red', 'rocks', 'background', 'shot', 'Snow', 'Canyon', 'Utah', 'music', 'was', 'fitting', 'work-out', 'opinion', 'had', 'good', 'beat', 'have', 'done', 'Kickbox', 'workouts', 'would', 'say', 'as', 'far', 'challenging', 'kickbox', 'moves', ""'d"", 'say', 'no', 'challenging', 'core', 'working', 'lower', 'body', '.absolutely', 'are', 'looking', 'advanced', 'kickboxing', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'emphasis', 'here', 'cross', 'training', 'core.The', 'workout', 'several', 'sections', 'punches', '13', 'minutes', 'core', 'training', '25', 'minutes', 'kicks', '18', 'minutes', 'Combo/Cooldown', '9/5', 'minutes', 'additional', 'bonus', 'workout', '14', 'minutes', '.The', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'workout', 'did', 'punches', 'core', 'training', 'stretched', 'own', 'extensive', 'cool', 'down', 'last', 'segment', 'dvd', 'would', 'recommend', 'extra', 'stretching', 'own', 'next', 'day', 'did', 'kicks', 'combo', 'bonus', 'end', 'week', 'tried', 'segments', 'together', 'making', '80', 'minute', 'workout.I', 'exercise', 'daily', 'doing', 'variety', 'work-outs-Salsa', 'Aerobic', 'Tae-Bo', 'Yoga', 'Pilates', 'etc', 'thought', 'first', 'would', ""n't"", 'challenge', 'enough', 'found', 'pace', 'be', 'aerobic', 'moves', 'were', ""n't"", 'hard', 'workout', 'definitely', 'kept', 'heart', 'rate', 'worked', 'muscles', 'obviously', 'had', 'not', 'recently', 'worked', 'hard', 'most', 'definitely', 'felt', 'muscles', 'even', 'couple', 'days', 'first', 'workout', 'core', 'butt', 'arms', 'inner', 'thigh', '.One', 'caution', 'be', 'careful', 'doing', 'carpet', 'where', 'are', 'pivoting', 'will', 'need', 'be', 'mindful', 'not', 'twisting', 'knee.In', 'bonus', 'section', 'would', 'caution', 'have', 'wrist', 'problems', 'section', 'primarily', 'variations', 'yoga', 'plank', 'position', 'beginning', 'push', 'up', 'am', 'very', 'familiar', 'plank', 'part', 'yoga', 'practice', 'still', 'felt', 'variations', 'were', 'challenging', 'will', 'build', 'strong', 'shapely', 'arms', 'Who', ""n't"", 'want', '.Overall', 'excellent', 'workout', 'would', 'definitely', 'purchase', 'item', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'looking', 'try', 'more', 'Patricia', 'dvds', 'future']",Kickbox - Core Cross Train

1120885,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B000YV1L6M,Little Miss Cutey,"[22, 24]","Patricia Moreno leads this workout and she's really good.  She cues well and is motivating.  I like that it's filmed outdoors instead of an indoor set - I for some reason find that more motivating because I'm thinking of Summer.  It's geared for intermediate to advanced exercisers although the choreography isn't too complicated.It's a great calorie burning workout that helps increase balance and strength.  If you think about it, you can really feel your core engage while doing this.  The segments start to get harder as the workout goes on, and I admit I found the kickboxing combos a little challenging and took a while to get more comfortable with it.  You'll really feel your muscles the next day for sure.  My favourite part of it all though is the stretch at the end.  It's so relaxing and deserved after finishing this.

I saw previews of this video on another site, and I thought that it would be entirely too slow for a person who has been involved with cardio kickboxing for about a decade. Even as I turned on the DVD for my morning workout, I was dreading the video and my expectations were LOW. Well, fast forward about 3 minutes, and I realized that this would be a great workout journey!My heart rate monitor indicated that I was between 55% and 85% of my maximal heart rate throughout at least 80% of the workout! I was impressed, and I liked Patricia's concentration on the core to elicit strong movements.

As a basis for comparison, I am 55, overweight and just getting back into better shape again after a 5-month ""fall off the exercise wagon"" due to a move and an illness.  I have experience with kickboxing workouts and enjoy kickboxing quite a lot.  I prefer moderate workouts most of the time with occasional intense workouts.  For me, as an example, Tae-bo is relatively intense.I found this workout relatively intense because it uses the large muscle groups so much--there is a lot of lunging, kicking and squatting.  It is not a cardio workout in the traditional sense, but it most definitely had me sweating.  I also found it intense in terms of my knees--and that isn't a good thing (hence 4 stars vs. 5).  There is an incredible amount of foot twisting in this workout and, with older knees and a carpeted surface, that can make for a really punishing workout.  If you're young, you probably won't notice or care.  If you're older or have had knee injuries, you'll probably want to rent this first and give it a try to see whether/how much it bothers you.Patricia Moreno is a good and inspirational leader (she also has amazing arms and shoulders).  She cues relatively well and does a slow breakdown of some of the more complicated moves before she actually starts doing them at full speed--I liked that a LOT because I get easily frustrated if I can't catch something on the first try.The workout, which is filmed with a beautiful Utah mountain/canyon backdrop, includes four main segments plus a bonus power workout:Punches:  Concentrates on punching (upper body) but still uses the lower body.Core Energizer:  Focuses on your core, but still features both the upper and lower body with punching and squatting.  Even though this segment is focused on the core, it is all done standing (i.e., not traditional crunches and such).Kicks:  Concentrates on kicking (lower body).  Having done a LOT of kickboxing workouts, I appreciated Patricia's method of teaching kicks.  She does a good job of giving you a foundation for kicking.Combinations:  In this segment, you take what you've learned and put it all together--punching and kicking at the same time while keeping your core engaged.Bonus Power Workout:  I haven't tried this one yet.  I'd read a review that said it was tough.  I watched it and thought ""Yikes!""  This workout is on the mat and features some positions that I'm pretty sure I couldn't get into. :)  I think this is more the territory of the advanced exercisor just from watching it.I wouldn't say it's the best kickboxing workout I've done, but it is clear that I not only worked hard during the workout but felt it the next day (and sometimes longer).P.S. Edited to add that I wanted to ditto another reviewer's comment that this workout could have included modifications for beginners or those with knee injuries, etc., but did not.

1120889,A3MFB2Z14O2ORN,B000YV1L6M,"Space Monkey ""exercise junkie""","[5, 5]","This was my first workout with Patricia Mareno as an instructor, and I have to say that, overall, I am very pleased.  I tried this workout yesterday, and was impressed with how easy the moves were, but how she really keeps the energy going with these simple moves.  There are four main workouts on this DVD, as other reviewers have already explained, and they are all very solid.  Here's the breakdown:The good:1) This is a nice cardio workout for the most part.  It is low-impact (no jumping or plyo moves), and it is nice to see a low-impact workout still raise your heart rate effectively.  If you're in reasonable shape, this workout isn't going to make the sweat pour off you, but that doesn't necessarily mean the workout isn't doing what it should.2) Moves are simple, for the most part, and easy to pick up.3) The emphasis on the core and how to correctly hold your core was very nice to me, and told me a lot about why I developed some injuries in the past in my lower back.  Instruction on that was very helpful.4) The instructor takes the time to show you a slower form of the move first, and actually lets you practice the move before she speeds it up.5) I was feeling this workout all over by the time I went to bed--it really works your entire core, if you listen to her instructions on what to do with your belly, shoulders, etc.  Great workout if you want to confuse those muscles and break out of a routine.Needs improvement:1)I did not find her cueing to be as effective as it could have been.  It was better than most instructors, but there were times when I would have appreciated her calling out the moves more often BEFORE they changed.  This would be very helpful for when she is putting together all the individual moves into combos.2) No modifications were shown for the moves.  With four people behind her, you'd think at least one of them could have been shouted a reminder to show a modified move!3) Even though this is low-impact, there are some twisting moves that are had on the knees if you have bad knees.  Also, during the first two workouts you're pretty much standing in horse/warrior stance the entire time.  This got a little irritating on my hip joints.Some minor annoyances:1) Did ANYONE else find the one guy behind her to look a little disturbing?  His poofy hair kept distracting me, and it looked like he wandered onto the set and they put him in the video.2) Nowhere on the DVD packaging does it tell you the length of each of the workouts.  (If it's there, someone please tell me where!)  I like to know how long segments are so I can plan my workouts.Overall, I really liked the workout and the instructor.  I will definitely be putting this workout in my rotation.",4,Simple yet effective.,1247788800,"07 17, 2009",2009,2712,"['was', 'first', 'workout', 'Patricia', 'Mareno', 'instructor', 'have', 'say', 'overall', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'tried', 'workout', 'yesterday', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'easy', 'moves', 'were', 'how', 'really', 'energy', 'going', 'simple', 'moves', 'are', 'four', 'main', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'explained', 'are', 'very', 'solid', 'Here', 'breakdown', 'good:1', 'nice', 'cardio', 'workout', 'most', 'part', 'low-impact', 'jumping', 'plyo', 'moves', 'nice', 'see', 'low-impact', 'workout', 'still', 'raise', 'heart', 'rate', 'effectively', ""'re"", 'reasonable', 'shape', 'workout', ""n't"", 'going', 'make', 'sweat', 'pour', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'workout', ""n't"", 'doing', 'what', 'should.2', 'Moves', 'are', 'simple', 'most', 'part', 'easy', 'pick', 'up.3', 'emphasis', 'core', 'how', 'correctly', 'hold', 'core', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'told', 'lot', 'why', 'developed', 'injuries', 'past', 'lower', 'back', 'Instruction', 'was', 'very', 'helpful.4', 'instructor', 'time', 'show', 'slower', 'form', 'move', 'first', 'actually', 'practice', 'move', 'up.5', 'was', 'feeling', 'workout', 'time', 'went', 'bed', 'really', 'entire', 'core', 'listen', 'instructions', 'what', 'do', 'belly', 'shoulders', 'etc', 'Great', 'want', 'confuse', 'muscles', 'break', 'routine.Needs', 'improvement:1', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'cueing', 'be', 'as', 'effective', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'better', 'most', 'instructors', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'calling', 'out', 'moves', 'more', 'often', 'changed', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'helpful', 'when', 'putting', 'together', 'individual', 'moves', 'combos.2', 'modifications', 'were', 'shown', 'moves', 'four', 'people', ""'d"", 'think', 'least', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shouted', 'reminder', 'show', 'modified', 'move', '3', 'Even', 'low-impact', 'are', 'twisting', 'moves', 'are', 'had', 'knees', 'have', 'bad', 'knees', 'Also', 'first', 'two', 'workouts', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'standing', 'horse/warrior', 'stance', 'entire', 'time', 'got', 'little', 'irritating', 'hip', 'joints.Some', 'minor', 'annoyances:1', 'Did', 'ANYONE', 'else', 'find', 'one', 'guy', 'look', 'little', 'disturbing', 'poofy', 'hair', 'kept', 'distracting', 'looked', 'wandered', 'set', 'put', 'video.2', 'Nowhere', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'tell', 'length', 'workouts', 'there', 'someone', 'please', 'tell', 'where', 'like', 'know', 'how', 'long', 'segments', 'are', 'so', 'can', 'plan', 'workouts.Overall', 'really', 'liked', 'workout', 'instructor', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'putting', 'workout', 'rotation']",Kickbox - Core Cross Train
