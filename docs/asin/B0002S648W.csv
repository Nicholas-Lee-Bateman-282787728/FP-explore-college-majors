844031,A1H7IQM3WMOF11,B0002S648W,"Heather Richards ""darkjediqueen""","[30, 33]","It would seem like Peacemaker would be retreading material that Rurouni Kenshin so admirably portrayed in that series, but Peacemaker is fresh and new in a way that draws you in and fascinates you. Both series deal with the turbulent Meji Era and the civil war tearing the country apart, but each one comes at the story from a different angle.Tetsu is a short, fiesty 15 year old who wants desparately to be included in the Shenshingumi so he can avenge the murder of his parents. Tetsu is stubborn and loud mouthed and attracts the interest of Souji Okita, an androgynous looking and acting member of the Shenshingumi. Okita is also an incredibly deadly swordsman, despite his looks. He intercedes for Tetsu with Hijikata, the tough and unforgiving commander of the fighting force who wants to send Tetsu packing. Okita wins the arguement and Tetsu is now Hijikata's page. Tetsu is desparate to prove himself and as events start getting more violent, Tetsu has to decide what he really wants when it comes to revenge.Tetsu is a bit of a brat, but you can't help rooting for him in his stubborn quest to be a member of the Shenshingumi. His relationship with his older brother Tatsu, is a sweet tough, as Tatsu, not a fighter at all, tries to protect his younger brother. Hijikata is commanding and unbending, but has his men's best interests at heart, even if he's harsh about it. He's also absolutely lethal to people who cross him. Okita is sweet, kind and has an adorable pet pig, but he too is a monster when fighting. Hajime Saitou (yes, based on the same character that Saitou in Kenshin was) is a genuinely admirable character here. A deadly swordsman on the one hand on a level with Okita, yet also able to communicate with spirits of the dead and in his own quiet way fond of Tetsu. There's also Yamazaki, a spy and mysterious character which doesn't keep him from being cool. The obvious set up for villain is Yoshida, on the opposite side of the civil war, and with a reputation. How do we know he's bad? Well, he's got creepy eyes, which is an automatic tip off. His apprentice is a white haired boy who seems just as bloodthirsty.Maybe the most intruiging part of Peacemaker is the characterization of the ""heroes"". On the one hand, they are likable and kind, on the other hand when in combat they're demons, remorseless killers and completely merciless to the opposition. You don't know whether to like them or hate them with their split personalities which harken thoughts of the Battousai in Kenshin, only it's all of them. Tetsu doesn't even seem sure on that count. He wants revenge, but he still balks at becoming the killers his peers obviously are. Peacemaker doesn't treat violence lightly. There's a lot of blood and a lot of killing, but it's portrayed for what war is, bloody and not very glamorous.Peacemaker is worth getting into. There are moments of humor set with moments of violence. It's a beautiful anime in a lot of ways and poignient too.",5,Best New Anime Out There,1097798400,"10 15, 2004",2004,2974,"['would', 'seem', 'Peacemaker', 'would', 'be', 'retreading', 'material', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'so', 'admirably', 'portrayed', 'series', 'Peacemaker', 'fresh', 'new', 'way', 'fascinates', 'series', 'deal', 'turbulent', 'Meji', 'Era', 'civil', 'war', 'tearing', 'country', 'apart', 'one', 'story', 'different', 'angle.Tetsu', 'short', 'fiesty', '15', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'desparately', 'be', 'included', 'Shenshingumi', 'can', 'avenge', 'murder', 'parents', 'Tetsu', 'stubborn', 'loud', 'mouthed', 'interest', 'Souji', 'Okita', 'androgynous', 'looking', 'acting', 'member', 'Shenshingumi', 'Okita', 'also', 'incredibly', 'deadly', 'swordsman', 'looks', 'Tetsu', 'Hijikata', 'tough', 'unforgiving', 'commander', 'fighting', 'force', 'who', 'send', 'Tetsu', 'packing', 'Okita', 'arguement', 'Tetsu', 'now', 'Hijikata', 'page', 'Tetsu', 'desparate', 'prove', 'events', 'start', 'getting', 'more', 'violent', 'Tetsu', 'decide', 'what', 'really', 'when', 'revenge.Tetsu', 'bit', 'brat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'rooting', 'stubborn', 'quest', 'be', 'member', 'Shenshingumi', 'relationship', 'older', 'brother', 'Tatsu', 'sweet', 'tough', 'Tatsu', 'not', 'fighter', 'tries', 'protect', 'younger', 'brother', 'Hijikata', 'commanding', 'unbending', 'men', 'best', 'interests', 'heart', 'even', 'harsh', 'also', 'absolutely', 'lethal', 'people', 'who', 'cross', 'Okita', 'sweet', 'kind', 'adorable', 'pet', 'pig', 'too', 'monster', 'when', 'fighting', 'Hajime', 'Saitou', 'yes', 'based', 'same', 'character', 'Saitou', 'Kenshin', 'was', 'genuinely', 'admirable', 'character', 'here', 'deadly', 'swordsman', 'one', 'hand', 'level', 'Okita', 'yet', 'also', 'able', 'communicate', 'spirits', 'dead', 'own', 'quiet', 'way', 'fond', 'Tetsu', 'also', 'Yamazaki', 'spy', 'mysterious', 'character', ""n't"", 'keep', 'being', 'cool', 'obvious', 'set', 'up', 'villain', 'Yoshida', 'opposite', 'side', 'civil', 'war', 'reputation', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'bad', 'Well', 'got', 'creepy', 'eyes', 'automatic', 'tip', 'off', 'apprentice', 'white', 'haired', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'bloodthirsty.Maybe', 'most', 'intruiging', 'part', 'Peacemaker', 'characterization', 'heroes', 'one', 'hand', 'are', 'likable', 'kind', 'other', 'hand', 'when', 'combat', ""'re"", 'demons', 'remorseless', 'killers', 'completely', 'merciless', 'opposition', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'like', 'hate', 'split', 'personalities', 'harken', 'thoughts', 'Battousai', 'Kenshin', 'only', 'Tetsu', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'sure', 'count', 'revenge', 'still', 'becoming', 'killers', 'peers', 'obviously', 'are', 'Peacemaker', ""n't"", 'treat', 'violence', 'lightly', 'lot', 'blood', 'lot', 'killing', 'portrayed', 'what', 'war', 'bloody', 'not', 'very', 'glamorous.Peacemaker', 'worth', 'getting', 'are', 'moments', 'humor', 'set', 'moments', 'violence', 'beautiful', 'anime', 'lot', 'ways', 'poignient', 'too']",N/A
844032,AR08H70QMVHCQ,B0002S648W,Jennifer Bullard,"[3, 3]","First of all, Peacemaker Kurogane is not really like Kenshin in any way.  Though some of the characters are the same, that is purely because they were referenced from real historical figures.  Other than that...Kenshin, being a wandering ronan who was once the battosai, has little to do with Tetsu, a young child who wants to join the Shinsengumi to avenge his parents deaths.That being said, when you first begin this series, you think of Tetsu as a bratty little child.  However, keep watching, he is actually a lot deeper and stronger than you will realize at first.  Once again, this series is really about character development, and it excels at this.  There are also some hints of boy-boy love, though not openly admitted.  But for those of us with a keen eye out for it, you will notice it.  There are a lot of great characters...so many, it's hard to talk about them all.  I must say that my favorite character was another young boy, about the same age as Tetsu, who is much more troubled, but so darn cute...Overall, the battle scenes are kind of few, but that's alright, when they do occur, they are fun to watch.  A lot goes on in a small amount of time, so it is never boring.  It also kind of ends abruptly without really explaining the ""peacemaker"", but oh well...we can live with that.",5,Outstanding........,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,1301,"['First', 'Peacemaker', 'Kurogane', 'not', 'really', 'Kenshin', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'same', 'purely', 'were', 'referenced', 'real', 'historical', 'figures', 'Other', 'Kenshin', 'being', 'wandering', 'ronan', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'battosai', 'little', 'do', 'Tetsu', 'young', 'child', 'who', 'join', 'Shinsengumi', 'avenge', 'parents', 'being', 'said', 'when', 'first', 'begin', 'series', 'think', 'Tetsu', 'bratty', 'little', 'child', 'However', 'keep', 'watching', 'actually', 'lot', 'deeper', 'stronger', 'will', 'realize', 'first', 'Once', 'again', 'series', 'really', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'also', 'hints', 'boy-boy', 'love', 'not', 'openly', 'admitted', 'keen', 'eye', 'will', 'notice', 'are', 'lot', 'great', 'characters', 'so', 'many', 'hard', 'talk', 'must', 'say', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'same', 'age', 'Tetsu', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'troubled', 'so', 'darn', 'cute', 'Overall', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'kind', 'few', 'alright', 'when', 'do', 'occur', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'lot', 'small', 'amount', 'time', 'never', 'boring', 'also', 'kind', 'ends', 'abruptly', 'really', 'explaining', 'peacemaker', 'oh', 'well', 'can', 'live']",N/A

I'm Kind Of A ...","[5, 6]","I wasn't going to write a review for peacemaker but for any of you that have seen this show  know as well as I that this show deserves a lot more than 3 stars. This show does lack a few key elements that  I'm sure will come into play later on in this series but still this is a great show.I mean it has to be good if it was requested to be aired on the anime network.This series does resemble Rurounie Kenshin with a few things like the way tetsunosuke's parents were massacred but the difference that messes tetsunosukes story up is that he has no one to teach him the ways of the sword and later on in the series might be thrown into a battle with little knowledge on fighting. Still this young 15 year old boy has a big heart full of courage and determination, but still a lot of hate and revenge linger inside him.It's a shame all he wants is to become stronger  so he can get revenge for his parents deaths and no one will help him.Tetsunosuke is 15 but treated as if he were 10 when he joins the army, Because of his size he's not taken seriously and automatically made a paige a few steps below his older brother who is qualified in size to be a swordsman but doesn't because of fear and obviously  doesn't have the courage his brother has.Overall this show is good and most likely will be great I suggest  any anime fans or this goes out more to the RK fans to go watch this,Don't get me wrong i don't think that this show could truely replace rurounie kenshin but it is a bit of a thirst quencher for diehard RK fans. Just because the show is around the same time period as RK and both Kenshin and Tetsunosuke have  similar backgorunds not the same but similar doesn't mean it's trying to take the place of it so give it a chance and get  deeper into the story before beating it down  with such bad reviews the show was compared to RK nobody ever said it was better.",5,Keeping The Peace,1104537600,"01 1, 2005",2005,1875,"['was', ""n't"", 'going', 'write', 'review', 'peacemaker', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'lot', 'more', '3', 'stars', 'show', 'lack', 'few', 'key', 'elements', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'come', 'play', 'later', 'series', 'still', 'great', 'show.I', 'mean', 'be', 'good', 'was', 'requested', 'be', 'aired', 'anime', 'network.This', 'series', 'resemble', 'Rurounie', 'Kenshin', 'few', 'things', 'way', 'tetsunosuke', 'parents', 'were', 'massacred', 'difference', 'tetsunosukes', 'story', 'up', 'one', 'teach', 'ways', 'sword', 'later', 'series', 'might', 'be', 'thrown', 'battle', 'little', 'knowledge', 'fighting', 'Still', 'young', '15', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'big', 'heart', 'full', 'courage', 'determination', 'still', 'lot', 'hate', 'revenge', 'linger', 'him.It', 'shame', 'all', 'become', 'stronger', 'can', 'get', 'revenge', 'parents', 'deaths', 'one', 'will', 'help', 'him.Tetsunosuke', '15', 'treated', 'were', '10', 'when', 'army', 'size', 'not', 'taken', 'seriously', 'automatically', 'made', 'paige', 'few', 'steps', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'qualified', 'size', 'be', 'swordsman', ""n't"", 'fear', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'have', 'courage', 'brother', 'has.Overall', 'show', 'good', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'suggest', 'anime', 'fans', 'out', 'more', 'RK', 'fans', 'go', 'watch', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'show', 'could', 'truely', 'replace', 'rurounie', 'kenshin', 'bit', 'thirst', 'quencher', 'diehard', 'RK', 'fans', 'Just', 'show', 'same', 'time', 'period', 'RK', 'Kenshin', 'Tetsunosuke', 'have', 'similar', 'backgorunds', 'not', 'same', 'similar', ""n't"", 'mean', 'trying', 'take', 'place', 'so', 'give', 'chance', 'get', 'deeper', 'story', 'beating', 'down', 'such', 'bad', 'show', 'was', 'compared', 'RK', 'nobody', 'ever', 'said', 'was', 'better']",N/A

This is in no way the greatness that was Kenshin.  The animation has way too much CGI and not enough detailed hand drawn style(a growing problem in many animes of today I feel)and the story is a boring retread of stuff we've seen before.  If you want something like this just watch Kenshin...And if you're looking for a worthy substitute for RK I am dissapointed to say that this isn't it.  *But I would like to take this time to recommend three really good anime shows that you must see if you haven't already - Berserk(fantasy/sorcery), Paranoia Agent(psychological/suspense) and as far as the robotic series go I would highly recommend Bubble Gum Crisis.  Feature wise anything by Satoshi Kon(Perfect Blue, Tokyo Godfathers) and of course Akira, Spriggan, Roujin Z and the Vampire Hunter D films.
