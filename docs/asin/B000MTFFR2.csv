1050865,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000MTFFR2,Byron Kolln,"[17, 18]","CHINA DOLL is a finely-pitched wartime drama.  Victor Mature plays Capt. Cliff Brandon, a  disillusioned airman fighting against the Japanese.  One morning he wakes up to discover he has purchased the services of a beautiful Chinese housekeeper, Shu-Jen (played by the celebrated Asian actress Li Li Hua in one of her rare American film appearances).This is one of the better films produced by Frank Borzage around this period.  Just like the similarly-themed ""Sayonara"" and ""The World of Suzie Wong"", CHINA DOLL explores the problems and prejudices involved in a cross-cultural relationship.Victor Mature is fine playing Captain Brandon; but it's Li Li Hua who really owns this picture.  She only made a handful of movies in America, but here she is truly magnificent.  The cast also includes Ward Bond, Bob Mathias, Johnny Desmond and Elaine Devry.It's great to see CHINA DOLL finally on DVD.  The disc offers no extras but the anamorphic transfer looks a treat.

1050869,AZUBX0AYYNTFF,B000MTFFR2,Donald M. Bishop,"[0, 0]","This 1958 film directed by Frank Borzage was set in China during World War II.  ""Captain Cliff Brandon"" (Victor Mature), drinking away his tour as a Hump Pilot, takes in ""Shu-Jen"" (played by the Hong Kong film star Lihua Li) as his housekeeper.  A gruff and distant relationship becomes affectionate; love follows; the two marry and have a daughter; and then the Japanese attack.The film can be appreciated from a number of angles.-- Intercultural marriage.  American moviegoers were offered ""Sayonara"" in 1957, ""South Pacific"" and ""China Doll"" in 1958, and ""Bridge to the Sun"" in 1961.  The treatments now show their age, but the different plots and characters were addressing interracial marriage, perhaps in response to the small but growing number of GIs returned from Japan and Korea with wives.  These films, even though they were about white-Asian marriages, should be recognized for denting interracial taboos, laying important psychological foundations for the Civil Rights movement a few years later.-- War film.  ""China Doll"" gave more visibility to the American aviators in the China-Burma-India theatre.  Spliced into the film are great scenes, originally shot by combat cameramen, of troop carrier aircraft dropping supplies to the American and Chinese troops crossing Burma.--  Aviation movie:  There are some fine scenes of the C-47 and the equipment and uniforms used during the war.  Inexplicably, the film editors who put together the other flying sequences must have had hangovers, and aviation buffs will no doubt wince at the several editing whoppers.Finally, if you happen to watch the film with Chinese friends, be prepared to hear them laugh out loud at the Hollywood characters' attempts to speak lines in Chinese.  Ward Bond had many virtues, but Mandarin dialog was not one.  On the other hand, they will nod in appreciation when Bond, playing a missionary, ""Father Cairns,"" says, speaking of 1943, ""I know China's somewhat behind the times, but you give her time and she'll catch up.""-30-",4,An unexpected gem ... different facets gleam ...,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,2017,"['1958', 'film', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Borzage', 'was', 'set', 'China', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Captain', 'Cliff', 'Brandon', 'Victor', 'Mature', 'drinking', 'away', 'tour', 'Hump', 'Pilot', 'Shu-Jen', 'played', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'film', 'star', 'Lihua', 'Li', 'housekeeper', 'gruff', 'distant', 'relationship', 'affectionate', 'love', 'two', 'marry', 'have', 'daughter', 'then', 'Japanese', 'attack.The', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'number', 'angles.', 'Intercultural', 'marriage', 'American', 'moviegoers', 'were', 'offered', 'Sayonara', '1957', 'South', 'Pacific', 'China', 'Doll', '1958', 'Bridge', 'Sun', '1961', 'treatments', 'now', 'show', 'age', 'different', 'plots', 'characters', 'were', 'addressing', 'interracial', 'marriage', 'perhaps', 'response', 'small', 'growing', 'number', 'GIs', 'returned', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'wives', 'films', 'even', 'were', 'white-Asian', 'marriages', 'should', 'be', 'recognized', 'denting', 'interracial', 'taboos', 'laying', 'important', 'psychological', 'foundations', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'few', 'years', 'later.', 'War', 'film', 'China', 'Doll', 'gave', 'more', 'visibility', 'American', 'aviators', 'China-Burma-India', 'theatre', 'Spliced', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'scenes', 'originally', 'shot', 'combat', 'cameramen', 'troop', 'carrier', 'aircraft', 'dropping', 'supplies', 'American', 'Chinese', 'troops', 'crossing', 'Burma.', 'Aviation', 'movie', 'are', 'fine', 'scenes', 'C-47', 'equipment', 'uniforms', 'used', 'war', 'Inexplicably', 'film', 'editors', 'who', 'put', 'together', 'other', 'flying', 'sequences', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'hangovers', 'aviation', 'buffs', 'will', 'doubt', 'wince', 'several', 'editing', 'whoppers.Finally', 'happen', 'watch', 'film', 'Chinese', 'friends', 'be', 'prepared', 'hear', 'out', 'loud', 'Hollywood', 'characters', 'attempts', 'speak', 'lines', 'Chinese', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'had', 'many', 'virtues', 'Mandarin', 'dialog', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'other', 'hand', 'will', 'nod', 'appreciation', 'when', 'Bond', 'playing', 'missionary', 'Father', 'Cairns', 'speaking', '1943', 'know', 'China', 'somewhat', 'times', 'give', 'time', ""'ll"", 'catch', 'up', '-30-']",China Doll

Not to give the ending away but what this describes as what happens at the end is absolutely wrong and needs to be changed as it is misleading.  Victor Mature was never a great actor but there isn't now and never has been a face like that on the movie screen. It is unique. I saw him once many years ago in New Orleans and recognized him instantly. He fits this part perfectly as it is an older rather jaded character boozing his way through his spare time in a war zone. I was not impressed with the beauty of the Chinese girl and she was waaaaaay too made up, hair too Americanized, but she did a very good job in the role.
