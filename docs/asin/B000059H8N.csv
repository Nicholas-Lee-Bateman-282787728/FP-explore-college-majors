The music was cut into the film great and the editing was fantastic.  I couldn't help noticing that Trey is extremely full of himself in the film. It is no wonder the band is broken up with an ego like that around.  I only hope that they can reconcile and get back to playing tunes together.  After some of the dialouge belched forth from Trey I wouldn't have blamed Fishman from punching Trey in the eye.  I would have liked to have heard more from Mike, he seems to be the most interesting and unassuming guy in the band.  Page also came off as being a very professional and serious musician...",4,Punch you in the eye,1014163200,"02 20, 2002",2002,680,"['think', 'documentary', 'really', 'free', 'wheeling', 'nature', 'phish', 'show', 'music', 'was', 'cut', 'film', 'great', 'editing', 'was', 'fantastic', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'noticing', 'Trey', 'extremely', 'full', 'film', 'wonder', 'band', 'broken', 'up', 'ego', 'only', 'hope', 'can', 'reconcile', 'get', 'back', 'playing', 'tunes', 'together', 'dialouge', 'belched', 'forth', 'Trey', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'blamed', 'Fishman', 'punching', 'Trey', 'eye', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'heard', 'more', 'Mike', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'unassuming', 'guy', 'band', 'Page', 'also', 'came', 'off', 'being', 'very', 'professional', 'serious', 'musician']",Phish - Bittersweet Motel

I have friends with more interesting personalities and viewpoints.2) Not enough good music. I've seen them play some damn good stuff. Sheech they followed them around long enough. Obviously the filmakers don't know when a band is ""on"" because they didn't put much of that in.As per usual in music movies, we'd like to see the BAND play. For some damn reason camera people always seem to think they are making an Orson Wells movie. Camera people: keep your egos out of it. Too many ill considered close ups at the wrong times. Too many shots of idiotic stuff like the parking lots, helicopters, the audience and everything EXCEPT the band INTERACTING. Groupies are less than boring, they're pathetic.The backstage stuff is crashingly boring.

572703,A3M4H8TYA4N69F,B000059H8N,John Jackson,"[8, 8]","This is a fantastic DVD that gives you a taste of the wonderful world of Phish.  I don't understand the statements of some reviewers saying that Todd Phillips hates Phish.  He did a freakin' movie about them for cryin' out loud.  And a pretty damn good one.  Trey dominates much of the footage because (guess what Phish fans)...He dominates the band.  I've seen and read countless interviews, and generally he's the one who has the most to say.  It's not his out-of-control ego, he just happens to be more verbose than the other 3 guys.  And he is also the primary songwriter of the band and the obviuos ""ringmaster"" of the group in their live performances.  I miss Phish just as much as the next guy, but enough with all this Trey-hating.  He is a BIG part of what made Phish so special (and may again.)I thought this film was great.  It captured the scene, the band, the music the personality.  Plus it was majorly cool to see the Great Wendt and remember what it was like to be there (that was actually my first Phish concert and my life was never the same afterwards.)If you don't know Phish and are curious, check out this film.If you are so hardcore that you argue about which was the best version of My Sweet One, then you'll probably complain about this film.",4,Trey Excellente!!,1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,1267,"['fantastic', 'DVD', 'taste', 'wonderful', 'world', 'Phish', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'statements', 'reviewers', 'saying', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'Phish', 'did', 'freakin', 'movie', 'cryin', 'out', 'loud', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'one', 'Trey', 'much', 'footage', 'guess', 'what', 'Phish', 'fans', 'band', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'read', 'countless', 'interviews', 'generally', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'say', 'not', 'out-of-control', 'ego', 'just', 'be', 'more', 'verbose', 'other', '3', 'guys', 'also', 'primary', 'songwriter', 'band', 'obviuos', 'ringmaster', 'group', 'live', 'performances', 'miss', 'Phish', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'enough', 'Trey-hating', 'BIG', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'Phish', 'special', 'may', 'again', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'captured', 'scene', 'band', 'music', 'personality', 'was', 'majorly', 'cool', 'see', 'Great', 'Wendt', 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'there', 'was', 'actually', 'first', 'Phish', 'concert', 'life', 'was', 'never', 'same', 'afterwards', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Phish', 'are', 'curious', 'check', 'out', 'film.If', 'are', 'so', 'hardcore', 'argue', 'was', 'best', 'version', 'My', 'Sweet', 'One', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'complain', 'film']",Phish - Bittersweet Motel
572704,A33PNNJOWEGH3Y,B000059H8N,J. Wolfson,"[4, 4]","I will begin by saying that if you are reading this, you probably are a phan. Phish music is unmistakable, undeniably fantastic; their ability to execute both technically astounding and fun music is well reknowned enough to continue with little mention of it.The disc is full of music, all good. One of the best scenes features the band developing the song &quot;Birds Of A Feather&quot; into what ended up on the recording &quot;The Story of the Ghost&quot;. There isn't alot of focus on the process, though, since it's mostly live performances in Europe and the East coast of the U.S. My interest is in the personalities, and there are some tantalizing scenes featuring backstage antics.One of the most fascinating things about the band is that they almost transform when they go on stage. Their off-stage demeanor is somehow completely different and during downtime Trey doesn't resemble the man on stage with the guitar- at all. When being interviewed, The group's frontman is depicted as a defensive 17 year old explaining why he's so minunderstood. Between musical feats of magic and rehersals, He's shown setting up pranks (which seem as improvised as anything the band does) and executing them with childlike glee.  A scene in Spain in which Trey buys a bullwhip and proceeds to crack it after a  few steps out the door is supremely telling. ...Or is it?Honestly, there is no way to tell anything concrete from the band as the interview/candid segments are few and far between, and approximately half of all screen time is given to Mr. Anastasio. I think the director lack of familiarity with the band ultimately creates the feel of The Stillwater T-shirt from Almost Famous; one guy is in focus and the rest are blurry and faded. The disc is surely lacking footage of the man Page McConnell calls &quot;the funniest guy in the band&quot;- Mike Gordon.As an addendum, I must say that the deleted scenes are some of the best- the two that focus more on Gordon are both interesting and hilarious. God knows why they were deleted.",4,"Great Band, Amazing Music, Good Movie",984009600,"03 8, 2001",2001,2035,"['will', 'begin', 'saying', 'are', 'reading', 'probably', 'are', 'phan', 'Phish', 'music', 'unmistakable', 'undeniably', 'fantastic', 'ability', 'execute', 'technically', 'astounding', 'fun', 'music', 'well', 'reknowned', 'enough', 'continue', 'little', 'mention', 'it.The', 'disc', 'full', 'music', 'good', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'band', 'developing', 'song', 'quot', 'Birds', 'A', 'Feather', 'quot', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'recording', 'quot', 'Story', 'Ghost', 'quot', ""n't"", 'alot', 'focus', 'process', 'though', 'mostly', 'live', 'performances', 'Europe', 'East', 'coast', 'U.S.', 'My', 'interest', 'personalities', 'are', 'tantalizing', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'backstage', 'antics.One', 'most', 'fascinating', 'things', 'band', 'almost', 'transform', 'when', 'go', 'stage', 'off-stage', 'demeanor', 'somehow', 'completely', 'different', 'downtime', 'Trey', ""n't"", 'resemble', 'man', 'stage', 'guitar-', 'When', 'being', 'interviewed', 'group', 'frontman', 'depicted', 'defensive', '17', 'year', 'old', 'explaining', 'why', 'so', 'minunderstood', 'Between', 'musical', 'feats', 'magic', 'rehersals', 'shown', 'setting', 'up', 'pranks', 'seem', 'as', 'improvised', 'anything', 'band', 'executing', 'childlike', 'glee', 'scene', 'Spain', 'Trey', 'bullwhip', 'proceeds', 'crack', 'few', 'steps', 'out', 'door', 'supremely', 'telling', 'Honestly', 'way', 'tell', 'anything', 'concrete', 'band', 'interview/candid', 'segments', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'approximately', 'half', 'screen', 'time', 'given', 'Mr.', 'Anastasio', 'think', 'director', 'lack', 'familiarity', 'band', 'ultimately', 'feel', 'Stillwater', 'T-shirt', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'one', 'guy', 'focus', 'rest', 'are', 'blurry', 'faded', 'disc', 'surely', 'lacking', 'footage', 'man', 'Page', 'McConnell', 'quot', 'funniest', 'guy', 'band', 'quot', 'Mike', 'Gordon.As', 'addendum', 'must', 'say', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'best-', 'two', 'focus', 'more', 'Gordon', 'are', 'interesting', 'hilarious', 'God', 'why', 'were', 'deleted']",Phish - Bittersweet Motel

572707,A2ASJ0IHIAOUW8,B000059H8N,T. Laxson,"[3, 4]","It's obvious that this film neglected a great portion of the vast and varied types of &quot;phish fans,&quot; but it would be impossible to display them all in 84 minutes, especially since the film is actually about the band itself.  The filmmakers overlooked, much to my chagrin, the sober fans who are often shunned among the &quot;phan&quot; community simply because of a personal choice.  Nevertheless, the film acheives what it set out to (with a few slight shortcomings).Some have been disappointed by the prevelance of Trey in the film and the seeming  disregard of Page, Mike, and Fish.  This &quot;problem&quot; is addressed in the interview with Todd Phillips.  It turns out that Trey was, as we all know, more outgoing and willing to be on camera and participate with the producers and director.  Though Fish will easily expose his body to thousands of people, he's not one for gratuitous verbal exposition.  Page just likes to sit in his own little corner and do his own thing.  Mike seems to have some self-esteem issues.  These all impede the complete portrayal of the band's personal lives.Personally, I watched this film for no reason other than the music.  As a bonus, I received: insight into Trey's humanity and difficult blend of sensibility and idealism; some spontaneous and completely genuine laughs; a brief peek at what goes on backstage; the knowledge of how Trey honestly feels about music in general and the music that he creates; and so much more.With all of this though, the film would only appeal to persons who are already fans of Phish.  It is when Trey goes into exmination of modern music culture (in his SUV, after reading the concert reviews) and of the familiar underdog and hopeless dreamer (on the golf cart, just before the final concert footage), that the film reaches beyond the parameters of Phishdom.  These sentiments are so commonly felt by everyone, especially those who express themselves artistically, that they can affect the most avid fan of popular music, breaking through the illusive barriers of arrogance and disdain.",5,"Not what I expected, but that's not a bad thing.",1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,2073,"['obvious', 'film', 'neglected', 'great', 'portion', 'vast', 'varied', 'types', 'quot', 'phish', 'fans', 'quot', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'display', '84', 'minutes', 'especially', 'film', 'actually', 'band', 'filmmakers', 'overlooked', 'much', 'chagrin', 'sober', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'often', 'shunned', 'quot', 'quot', 'community', 'simply', 'personal', 'choice', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'few', 'slight', 'shortcomings', '.Some', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'prevelance', 'Trey', 'film', 'seeming', 'disregard', 'Page', 'Mike', 'Fish', 'quot', 'problem', 'quot', 'addressed', 'interview', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'out', 'Trey', 'was', 'know', 'more', 'outgoing', 'willing', 'be', 'camera', 'participate', 'producers', 'director', 'Fish', 'will', 'easily', 'expose', 'body', 'thousands', 'people', 'not', 'one', 'gratuitous', 'verbal', 'exposition', 'Page', 'just', 'likes', 'sit', 'own', 'little', 'corner', 'do', 'own', 'thing', 'Mike', 'have', 'self-esteem', 'issues', 'impede', 'complete', 'portrayal', 'band', 'personal', 'lives.Personally', 'watched', 'film', 'reason', 'other', 'music', 'bonus', 'received', 'insight', 'Trey', 'humanity', 'difficult', 'blend', 'sensibility', 'idealism', 'spontaneous', 'completely', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'brief', 'peek', 'what', 'backstage', 'knowledge', 'how', 'Trey', 'honestly', 'music', 'general', 'music', 'so', 'much', 'though', 'film', 'would', 'only', 'appeal', 'persons', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'fans', 'Phish', 'when', 'Trey', 'exmination', 'modern', 'music', 'culture', 'SUV', 'reading', 'concert', 'reviews', 'familiar', 'underdog', 'hopeless', 'dreamer', 'golf', 'cart', 'just', 'final', 'concert', 'footage', 'film', 'parameters', 'Phishdom', 'sentiments', 'are', 'so', 'commonly', 'felt', 'everyone', 'especially', 'who', 'express', 'artistically', 'can', 'affect', 'most', 'avid', 'fan', 'popular', 'music', 'breaking', 'illusive', 'barriers', 'arrogance', 'disdain']",Phish - Bittersweet Motel
