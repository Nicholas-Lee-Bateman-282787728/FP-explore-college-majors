1408021,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B004H5UDWE,Amit Talpade,"[4, 5]","Guzaarish is about a crippled musician living in a desolate mansion in Goa. A shadow of his glorious past Ethan is dependent on his full time nurse ( Aishwarya Rai), who has cared for him for the last 12 years. His disability does not stop him from hosting a radio show or writing a book. To everyone, he is a person who has conquered his disability and is living a full life. People, both closest and outsiders are shocked when he files a petition through his lawyer for Euthanasia. The movie tells us about Ethan's life both past and present through flashbacks and his fight to have the right to die.Sanjay Leela Bhansali or SLB, has once again chosen a bleak topic to make a movie on. He is no stranger to such stories, having made films on deaf and mute people ( Khamoshi), Alzheimer's and blindness ( Black) and alcoholism ( Devdas). As in the past this is not an original story idea but has been inspired from other sources, for this movie SLB relies on the  movies, Sea Inside and Whose Life is it anyway, but has modified the script greatly and has set it in Goa. A complete entertainer, this movie had great music, dialogues, script, acting and direction.Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai put in great performances and their chemistry, as it was in Jodhaa Akbar and Dhoom 2, is amazing. Hrithik has put in the best performance of his career and Rai supports his at every nuance. The rest of the cast is superb as well, including the people who have one minute roles. The music, one of the best of 2010, is melodious. Ek Tera Zikr, Saayba, 100 gram zindagi are some of the great tracks. They are choreographed and shot well, just watch Udi, featuring Aishwarya Rai to see what I mean. SLB has composed the music himself, shows that the man is supremely talented. The photography is marvelous and Goa looks beautiful. This is a top notch product and easily one of the best films of 2010. 4 stars. 1/31/11",4,"Guzaarish ( The request), one of the best of 2010",1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,1910,"['Guzaarish', 'crippled', 'musician', 'living', 'desolate', 'mansion', 'Goa', 'A', 'shadow', 'glorious', 'past', 'Ethan', 'dependent', 'full', 'time', 'nurse', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'who', 'cared', 'last', '12', 'years', 'disability', 'not', 'stop', 'hosting', 'radio', 'show', 'writing', 'book', 'everyone', 'person', 'who', 'conquered', 'disability', 'living', 'full', 'life', 'People', 'closest', 'outsiders', 'are', 'shocked', 'when', 'petition', 'lawyer', 'Euthanasia', 'movie', 'Ethan', 'life', 'past', 'present', 'flashbacks', 'fight', 'have', 'right', 'die.Sanjay', 'Leela', 'Bhansali', 'SLB', 'once', 'again', 'chosen', 'bleak', 'topic', 'make', 'movie', 'stranger', 'such', 'stories', 'having', 'made', 'films', 'deaf', 'mute', 'people', 'Khamoshi', 'Alzheimer', 'blindness', 'Black', 'alcoholism', 'Devdas', 'past', 'not', 'original', 'story', 'idea', 'been', 'inspired', 'other', 'sources', 'movie', 'SLB', 'movies', 'Sea', 'Inside', 'Whose', 'Life', 'anyway', 'modified', 'script', 'greatly', 'set', 'Goa', 'A', 'complete', 'entertainer', 'movie', 'had', 'great', 'music', 'dialogues', 'script', 'acting', 'direction.Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'put', 'great', 'performances', 'chemistry', 'was', 'Jodhaa', 'Akbar', 'Dhoom', '2', 'amazing', 'Hrithik', 'put', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'Rai', 'nuance', 'rest', 'cast', 'superb', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'one', 'minute', 'roles', 'music', 'one', 'best', '2010', 'melodious', 'Ek', 'Tera', 'Zikr', 'Saayba', '100', 'gram', 'zindagi', 'are', 'great', 'tracks', 'are', 'choreographed', 'shot', 'well', 'just', 'watch', 'Udi', 'featuring', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'SLB', 'composed', 'music', 'man', 'supremely', 'talented', 'photography', 'marvelous', 'Goa', 'beautiful', 'top', 'notch', 'product', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2010', '4', 'stars', '1/31/11']",N/A

1408024,A1RXVSBGGRKIIW,B004H5UDWE,"Comparison Shopping  Consumer ""Don't Shop! Ad...","[1, 3]","Without giving away the outcome, I can tell you that despite the somber subject matter, this is a *feel good* movie- in an ironically tear jerker, kind of way. ( If you watch it, you will understand why I wrote that).The two leading stars are very convincing in their parts.The subject matter of human euthanasia is something many of us do not like to think about.Euthansia is an ancient word that translates roughly into: * a good death- merciful death*.While you become charmed immediately by the lead character's upbeat personality- at the same time you will notice his positive outlook and how he dealt with his quadraplegic status over the years is in stark contradiction to wishing to end his life.Since the movie's plot focus, is about his desire to end his life, naturally, many viewers will be  hoping he will change his mind.Then again,many people may relate to his predicament and completely understand his position, to be allowed to die.When the movie ends, it will give you something to think about regarding euthanasia and  how it can never really be a black or white issue or question.Neither does it come with a black or white answer.So many shades of gray are here.But, unlike instances we have seen in America, where some people were forced to pull the plug or cease feeding *brain dead* family members, this is a man who has his mental faculties intact.He is of sound mind-  just not of sound body. This is his wish.(In  cases with brain dead people, and the ugly fights among family over whether to pull the plug or withhold food, etc- the person that is in the hospital bed, has no say.)So there are some similarities to health situations that seem to have a poor or dismal prognosis- whether that person in the predicament is alert and reasonable or brain dead and unable to express what their desires would be in such a scenario.When the movie begins, our lead character has already been in a quadraplegic state for over a decade.He has a beautifully upbeat attitude, despite his circumstances and especially considering the drastic change his life has taken.A tragic accident while performing an act as a magician, renders him a young man that is bedridden and physically helpless.The life he had before the accident was so very different from where he finds himself now.  You find yourself quite surprised he does not show any sign of bitterness. To the contrary, he can be quite a humorous ham.Still, even with a good attitude, he needs constant care for every little thing. EVERY LITTLE THING.When you learn he has been in this situation for over a decade, and you see he is a man of optimism about life in general-  it is easy to feel empathy for his personal belief, that due to a quality of life issue, why he would feel that he would be better off not being here.It is not like he did not attempt to adjust to life as a quadraplegic. He adjusted and then some. He runs a radio station as it is his witty mind and quick tongue that are still intact.But we see that his disability is now beginning to wear him down.It did not kill him physically- but it seems to now be wearing down his spirit.Does he have a quality of life?  Isn't a good quality of life often subjective?And this is how the story begins... a very intimate view of the trials and tribulations of a quadraplegic man, who at heart- is definitely NOT a quitter.So, you will root for him to live- and yet understand why he wants to die.The viewer is  left very unsure of how this will all conclude.I liked that you felt that the movie could go either way, regardless of your personal opinions on the matter of euthanasia and how you feel about this man.With that thought in mind, I can  say that I recommend the movie because of this very hot button issue: the ever so controversial idea of  *mercy killings* .As my review title states: you will also witness what is for one person to love another in the most dedicated and purest of ways.It is very heart touching and both lead actors do a great job in their roles; but Roshnan steals the show because his predicament is the focal point.Aishwarya definitely can steal any show with just her beauty alone.Her always stunning, yet soulful blue eyes, speak volumes- no matter what emotion she is experiencing.She plays her part well, as a woman you will easily believe is truly devoted to this bedridden man who wants so desperately to leave this world.

Clearly a western influence in the selection of the storyline, it's main topic and how that topic should be examined. However, clearly an Indian influence in the sensitivity given to this topic and how the actor's should define it.(3.) The topic as you probably know by now is ""Death with dignity."" Defined with a few simple key phrases such as: ""Are the courts a party to someone ending their own life by permitting it.""  Not explored was that that argument fails even the most elementary rules of Aristotelian logic. Also, ""Can one be condemned to life against their own wishes?"" and ""Whose life is it?""(4.)

1408030,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004H5UDWE,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","I'm so used to Bollywood films being all silly and overwrought that I'm always taken aback whenever the industry rolls with the ambitious high-brow flavor. SWADES, BLACK, THE LAST LEAR, and even LUCK BY CHANCE are legitimately dramatic films that eschew traditional Indian cinema conventions. GUZAARISH, a lavish production, is cut from the same mold. GUZAARISH tells of an unusual love story. It's about the human spirit and how it perseveres in the face of hopelessness. GUZAARISH chronicles an ongoing courtroom battle in which a man strives to win the legal right to kill himself. So, no, you won't see guys like Govinda in this one.GUZAARISH reunites Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai (from DHOOM 2 and JODHAA AKBAR), and these two actors put their souls into their performances; they light up the screen. For Roshan's character, Ethan Mascarenhas, it must be sheer torture. Once a celebrated stage magician who dazzled the masses, Ethan, fourteen years ago, suffered a calamitous accident during one of his acts which left him a paraplegic from the neck down. The stern Sofia D'Souza (Aishwarya Rai) has been Ethan's nurse for the past twelve years, tending to his needs, the one constant in his life. The playful Ethan can't resist tweaking her a bit, her and her exacting demeanor.Ethan is a disc jockey nowadays, hosting the popular Radio Zindagi, broadcasting from his home. Ethan is one of them dudes what exudes a zest for life. But it's a charade. As the years have gone on, and Ethan sees no improvement to his paralysis, he's gradually surrendered, gradually given up. And, as we soon observe, he's prone to colossal fits of rage and melancholy. Ethan has folks who love him. His mother. His best friend. His nurse, although she won't admit it. Imagine their shock when, out of the blue, he ambushes them with the news that he's filing a petition at the Goa High Court for euthanasia. Except that the Indian legal system does not allow for euthanasia. And this is one of the central conflicts of the story: Ethan Mascarenhas' fight for the right to die. It'll prove to be an exhausting struggle.This is a high concept movie. No one was gonna ef this up by introducing caricatured characters, insipid humor, or infantile plot threads. I think there are folks out there who regard Hrithik Roshan in much the same way folks used to regard Paul Newman and how they currently perceive a guy like, say, Brad Pitt. I just saw MONEY BALL, and Brad Pitt is a damn terrific actor. Except, I guess, some folks can't see past the glamour and the matinee idol looks. Roshan can act. He acted the hell out of this movie. The three things that you immediately take away from watching Hrithik Roshan are how handsome he is, how sculpted his physique, how talented he is as a dancer. This film restricts him to a wheelchair, confines him to bed. Except you notice his expressiveness even more, the sheer presence he has. Roshan boasts one of the most soulful gazes in the business. Flashbacks make us privy to several of Ethan Mascarenhas' magic acts, and they are marvelous feats of sleight-of-hand and they are presented stunningly. There is one amazing act during which he walks up a friggin' beam of light. I love the dreamlike, ethereal quality in these flashbacks. There are a few musical numbers scattered here and there and, in his dancing, Hrithik Roshan's mobility and fluidity are magnified. Contrast his physical grace with how, in the present day, he's slumped in a chair like an awful lump.Aishwarya Rai has the less showy role, but this is one of her most solid performances, maybe her best since RAINCOAT. It's easy to be larger than life, more challenging to play it close to the vest, to be restrained and stoic and yet suggest the existence of layers. As Roshan is the best male dancer in Indian cinema in his era, so too is Aishwarya the female equivalent in hers. She struts her stuff somewhat in ""Udi."" I only wish it were more, and that Aishwarya had had a chance to really unleash her moves.There's a tug of war in this film between earnestness and just a whiff of pretentiousness. And I do think that, in the end, Ethan's big closing argument in the Goa courthouse - which involves audience participation and one of his magic props - is telegraphed somewhat. But I appreciated what the film was going for, its themes of steadfastness and abiding love and a fight for independence and relishing life or however much is left in that hourglass. I appreciated the film's sincerity and the actors' unfettered commitment. There are moments here which may strike you as over-the-top. Except that Indian cinema is noted for its expansiveness and extravagance, and so what if some of that does seep into the film? It's part of the culture, folks being true to themselves. I respect that. And this is a good film, even a prestigious film. It's Bollywood trying to grow up.The DVD's bonus features: the Making of GUZAARISH featurette (00:22:40 minutes long, and mostly in English); Deleted Scenes, including a sequence which was intended to follow what ended up being the film's closing scene (00:04:19 minutes); and the trailer and promos for the film.",4,"""Shake me.

The actors are all in their element and give a decent performance, including Aishwarya Rai much to my chagrin because I think she is a less than mediocre actress. Sanjay Leela Bhansali could have done a better job of portraying the character as a man whose body is wasting away in order to garner the attention of the audience and make us understand why he is in so much agony. It's difficult to feel sorry for the character of Ethan when he is shown to have a successful career with a legion of fans after the accident that left him disabled. Not too many people who are disabled have that kind of opportunity and this film fails to grasp the fundamentals of living a life as a quadriplegic.

1408039,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,B004H5UDWE,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[3, 5]","First off, I have to say that this movie robs me of any credibility when it comes to my ability to be objective. For the most part I try to make these reviews balanced, and funny. (I know I fail more often than not at the funny) Unfortunately, there are times when one cannot even attempt at leaving personal beliefs and circumstances out of art. For me, this is one such time. From the opening scene my point-of-view is unashamedly biased. Why, you may rightfully ask? To that question I can only reply, because Ethan and I have a very similar perspective of the world. We view it in treacherous bodies confined to wheelchairs, beds, and couches. In my case my Cerebral Cortex was damaged some time during or before my premature birth resulting in Cerebral Palsy. Ethan's plight was born from an accident. Either way, when you live at the mercy of a fickle and treacherous body which slowly robs you of independence and freedom, you can't help but see life differently from the vast majority of your fellow human beings.So yes, I can't be objective because I've got quite a bit in common with the hero. He's got a radio station, I have this lovely laptop which allows me to indulge my great passions the chief of these being words. Speaking of words, I've picked up quite a bit of Hindi from this raging Bollywood addiction and I have to say that next to Pyar, (love) I'm enthralled with the word Guzarish, (Request) and yes I did spell it properly, Hindi movie titles usually add or subtract letters in words to suit numerology. Guzarish is a powerful word, to request is more than just to ask, it's deeper than that. Which brings me to a lesser reason of why I can't be objective about this film, the request itself, the guzarish to die. Because of my faith, the sanctity of human life is non-negotiable, in other words I would never kill myself or ask another person for assistance to end my life. Now you may rightfully be thinking, ""why you little hypocrite! How can you possibly rate this movie five stars when you believe Ethan shouldn't make this guzarish?""Good question! Frankly I haven't decided if I'm hypocritical or not. All I am certain of is I understand the most important thing that makes this movie so important to me. I understand WHY! I understand why Ethan has made his request, I understand why his best friend decides to fight for him, I understand why it breaks the heart of the woman who loves him more than her own life, but stands by him anyway, I understand why his doctor cannot and will not condone it, and I understand why his mother loves him unconditionally. It's the WHY that makes this film work.I admit, I'm no Ethan. I have my hands, my lungs work just fine, my kidneys are great, I'm not even paralyzed. I've just gotten too old and too weak to haul myself around on my legs. I can feel just about all sensation, although as the years pass it decreases in certain areas. Unlike Ethan, I live in constant agonizing pain that never lets up for a moment. There are other difficulties that I face and I've got no hope for major improvements, forgive the expression, 'it all goes down from here.' So there are days when I really wish I didn't wake up. But whenever I watch this movie it hits me, ""This man can't feel the touch of his loved ones. This man can't hold a baby in his arms. This man will never make love to the one person he loves with the very deepest parts of his heart and soul! This man can't even hold his mother's hand! This man can't break things in a temper."" Then I wonder, which is worse feeling nothing, or pain so bad it drives you crazy sometimes? I've come to the conclusion neither is worse, it's all a living hell. But at least my thing doesn't condemn me to a slow and terrible death. Poor Ethan, not-so-fortunate. So yeah, I totally understand why he's made his guzarish, but like his doctor, I can't agree with it.Ethan's flaw isn't selfishness, it can't be selfish to want to spare his loved ones witnessing the inevitable death he's destined for without intervention. Nobody with a heart wants their loved ones to have the agony of sitting by helplessly watching them suffer. I speak from experience. Ethan's flaw is weakness, he simply cannot face the end he's being forced to have. I don't blame him for that! After so many years of fighting and overcoming he's run out of strength, and he doesn't have the capacity to draw it from others. I don't agree with his solution but I do understand. My compassion, my empathy, my own suffering compels me to understand, and because of it I cannot and will not condemn.That doesn't mean I'm on his side, I'm not! If I'm on anyone's side it's Sophia! If there's one thing that's kept me from making my own guzarish over the years it's the simple fact that my loved ones need me alive because they NEED to give me their love. You can't give love to a corpse. Sophia needed to love Ethan more than he needed to die! Ah Sophia, as much as I see myself in Ethan I also see myself in her. Another reason I've never made a guzarish, is that you can't *give* love if you're a corpse. Giving love is a powerful reason to live, and in Sophia's case heal from an abusive husband. If there is one MAJOR flaw in this film it's that Ethan never acknowledges that what he's doing is taking away Sophia's greatest happiness, loving him. Granted she knows, he knows, and he knows, she knows, he knows, (yes I'm going for a tiny bit of levity) but still, would an ""I'm so sorry that I'm too weak to endure what's next,"" be out-of-line here? As a woman, I don't think so!Now enough of this sentimental stuff! Time to get down to the nitty-gritty of movie greatness. Production: Sanjay Leela Bhansali is one heck of a director! Okay my favorite is still Ashutosh Gowariker is still my favorite! He made,Jodhaa Akbar (Three-Disc Collector's Edition)people, and it doesn't get better than that! But Mr. Bhansali is pretty darn close! Like Mr. Gowariker, he creates images like fine paintings on screen. He is one obsessively intense micro-manager, and it works! Every sight and sound is exquisite to experience. I appreciate someone with a vision and the talent to get it. But I just have to say, from the interviews I've read he's a very intense personality, to put it mildly. I think he's the Van Gough of Hindi films. I love Van Gough, but I'm glad I'm not a Bollywood actress that's for sure! Good thing his stars aren't so sensitive, and cue the ""love letters"" they start now!First up: My Hindi film queen, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan! This is actually, the last film she's done since her pregnancy and birth of her little daughter. In other words, it's been three years! Now I'm all for taking time out to be mama, I wish more people liked raising babies better than making money. That said, if you're an actor and you're going on hiatus for a while leave with an ASTOUNDING role! Mrs. Rai Bachchan is a very smart lady. She played all her cards right, she paired with a director who considers her his favorite muse, she teamed up with her best leading man (on film) these two have some white hot chemistryDhoom 2: Bollywood Movie, and she made sure she got a juicy non-item-girl role with a slamming dance number. Now that is using your brain! Also I have said this many, many, times this poor woman is tragically underrated as a superior actor simply because God decided to break the mold when her DNA was being mixed. Yes she's beautiful! As Ethan says ""I don't call her sister"" how can he? But this woman is so much more than just beautiful! As great as the script and the Director of this film is, Sophia wouldn't exist without Mrs. Rai Bachchan, ergo Ethan wouldn't exist!Not even the Shashensha of Bollywood can do everything alone.Hrithik Roshan, or as I like to say, here is what would happen if aliens abducted Errol Flynn, Paul Newman, Fred Astaire, and Gene Kelly mixed their molecular structure and deposited this new amazing creature on planet earth! I've pontificated at great length about how super he is in everything he does, but this (until I see Agneepath) is the culmination of every power. Perfection, sheer, unadulterated, perfection in every way! As I mentioned I live in a chair myself, and I can tell when an ""able-bodied"" actor just sits in one and la ti da's it. Mr. Roshan is not a la ti da! In fact, he did just as good as Sam Worthington did in AVATAR. He let the chair become his body, and he never once twitched a finger! Why wasn't this movie submitted for Oscar consideration? I can't choose a favorite scene, but I do know the one that made me believe he was Ethan. I won't say what happens but it involves a vase, and all I could think was, ""he gets it! He knows exactly what it is to be trapped inside your own body!"" This man, possibly one of the absolute greatest dancers of all time understood the rage and helplessness of being denied control over his physical self. That's not acting, that is truth! O-Zeem-O-Shashensha!Shernaz Patel, is one of my very favorites now. It's hard going up against two of the most amazingly beautiful and talented people in creation and play the guy's best dosti (friend) who also happens to be a woman. But Devyani is quite a wonderful dosti, and she reminds me of some of my many good guy-friends that I occasionally flirt with on a day when I need cheering up. Come to think of it, she also reminds me of my two tigress sisters. By the end of the movie I want her to hug me too! And I want a chai and gossip fest but... Yeah.Suhel Seth, Scary brilliant! I have flashbacks to my childhood and a certain Doctor who absolutely refused to put up with my nonsense! Oh boy, I know the movie is in Hindi, but I rarely needed the subtitles to know what he was saying. I love watching him.Okay I admit it, there is one major thing about this movie I'm not too keen on. Aditia Roy Kapoor, AKA: Omar, Omar, Omar, Omar! I don't know if I wasn't keen on Omar, or I just don't like the actor. I keep thinking to myself, ""why can't this guy be played by, Imram Khan, Neil Nitin Mukesh, or even Harman Bawjea!"" All of whom I like to watch so much more than Mr. Roy Kapoor. Omar, or more likely, the actor irritates me to no end. Thankfully, his seniors make him relatively obscure.Special shout out to Mama Isobel! AKA Nafisa Ali, what a lady! As if I hadn't been crying enough she made me lose all control, and then she... whoops I won't spoil.Music: UDI! Is just great, but Mr. Roshan ACTUALLY singing ""What A Wonderful World"" made me forget about Louis Armstrong for a split second. I think I might have committed a sin by saying it, but lying is a worse one. There are other amazing songs as well so Mr. Bhansali is also a great musical director. Even if he didn't believe his hero at first when he mentioned he could sing! Oh to be a fly on that wall, or nose.I've rambled quite a bit, but this time it's personal. But then the best art challenges you and makes yourself aware of things in your heart you didn't know were there. This movie shows me something new about myself every time.",5,To Understand It Isn't Necessary To Agree,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,11042,"['First', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'robs', 'credibility',

1408040,AW7P8LRCFHFSG,B004H5UDWE,Z.B,"[2, 3]","GUZAARISH is not an abstract and ambiguous film. It's a simply narrated film made with a lot of heart. Although it's sensitive, it never gets dukhi. Sanjay Leela Bhansali has treated the grave issue of mercy killing with maturity. Although it's about a suffering person who wants to end his life, its message is about celebrating life. The best part about the film is that it involves you as a viewer. You surely feel for Ethan's plight. He leaves you smiling in many scenes and moist-eyed in some.The first half is so breezy that you don't realise when it gets over. The second half is a bit of a drag. Like KAL HO NAA HO and the more recent PAA, GUZAARISH's narrative is very light-hearted laden with humorous moments. Ethan says, 'God pe bharosa hai, isiliye I am dying to meet him.' Also, the scene in which Sofia gives Ethan a leg massage is uproarious.There are some really poignant moments that leave a lasting impression. Ethan watches a scarecrow on a field, which is symbolic to his own condition. The court-room scenes are just too good. While you expect Ethan to give a long monologue, he conveys everything through his 60-seconds magic trick.",4,Blew My Mind!,1300579200,"03 20, 2011",2011,1155,"['GUZAARISH', 'not', 'abstract', 'ambiguous', 'film', 'simply', 'narrated', 'film', 'made', 'lot', 'heart', 'sensitive', 'never', 'dukhi', 'Sanjay', 'Leela', 'Bhansali', 'treated', 'grave', 'issue', 'mercy', 'killing', 'maturity', 'suffering', 'person', 'who', 'end', 'life', 'message', 'celebrating', 'life', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'viewer', 'surely', 'feel', 'Ethan', 'plight', 'smiling', 'many', 'scenes', 'moist-eyed', 'some.The', 'first', 'half', 'so', 'breezy', 'do', ""n't"", 'realise', 'when', 'over', 'second', 'half', 'bit', 'drag', 'KAL', 'HO', 'NAA', 'HO', 'more', 'recent', 'PAA', 'GUZAARISH', 'narrative', 'very', 'light-hearted', 'laden', 'humorous', 'moments', 'Ethan', 'bharosa', 'hai', 'isiliye', 'am', 'dying', 'meet', 'Also', 'scene', 'Sofia', 'Ethan', 'leg', 'massage', 'uproarious.There', 'are', 'really', 'poignant', 'moments', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'Ethan', 'scarecrow', 'field', 'symbolic', 'own', 'condition', 'court-room', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'expect', 'Ethan', 'give', 'long', 'monologue', 'conveys', 'everything', '60-seconds', 'magic', 'trick']",N/A
