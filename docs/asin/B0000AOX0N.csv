Of course I watch it and all the while I'm thinking, this is NOT the same as The Land Before Time. It's not the same voices, it's not as well done, but then I glance over at my son in awe of the dinosaurs singing, dancing, fighting, and playing and completely forget the first move. This movie is awesome. It's got everything any little boy would love. Huge dinosaurs, `sharp tooth' x's 3, and the great circle.

There is nothing wrong with this film at all. It is my opinion that the creators had the right idea of allowing Little Foot live with who he wanted to live with...after all the &quot;grandparents&quot; raised this little guy since he was real young...most people would not go and live with someone they just met a day or two ago...person or dinosaur. This is a great film for everyone regardless...and for those that felt this was condecending and the like need to get a life!,4,Son loved it....,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,587,"['think', 'are', 'reviews', 'here', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'way', 'seriously', 'kids', 'film', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'film', 'opinion', 'creators', 'had', 'right', 'idea', 'allowing', 'Little', 'Foot', 'live', 'who', 'wanted', 'live', 'quot', 'grandparents', 'quot', 'raised', 'little', 'guy', 'was', 'real', 'young', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'live', 'someone', 'just', 'met', 'day', 'two', 'ago', 'person', 'dinosaur', 'great', 'film', 'everyone', 'regardless', 'felt', 'was', 'condecending', 'like', 'need', 'get', 'life']",N/A
