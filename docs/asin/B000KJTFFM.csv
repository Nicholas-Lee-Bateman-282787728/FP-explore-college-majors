It is about a group of ghouls hiding in a strip club, and a group trying to survive them. It has Ken Foree (they guy from Dawn of the Dead, TCM:3, and Devil's Rejects), as well as the dude from Idle Hands. You just have to watch this movie, it is fun. I love the dialogue, it is the funniest I've seen in a while. This is a fun movie, the characters are not to be taken seriously, and that is what makes this movie cool. Way better than I expected, actually I expected it to be crapp, and it turned out to be pretty funny.

The surreal and very beautiful lighting adds a lot to the rich atmosphere.  Some scenes tend to drag a little bit but this is easy to overlook when the film itself looks as good as this does.

Eschewing the typical zombie/vampire flick, DEVIL'S DEN gives us some nasty ghouls who moonlight as strippers in the Devil's Den.

1034589,A2ZRV40FWALSQB,B000KJTFFM,"Richard Nervous ""Dedicated Horror Fan""","[2, 5]","I didn't have a lot of expectations going into this film so I didn't know what I was in for.  I actually watched it on cable so this is not a DVD review.The story is about 2 college guys traveling from Mexico with Spanish Fly.  They see a sign for a strip club and decide that they should ""try out"" their ""real"" Spanish Fly tablets on some strippers.  The place is called the Devils Den and they expect to see a lot of overweight strippers but what they find surprises them, very much like in From Dusk to Dawn.The story develops with Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead, Devil's Rejects - amongst others) as an almost blind patron with bifocal glasses and a woman that is rather course (Kelly Hu)watching the ""show.""  One of the guys slips some Spanish Fly in a strippers beer and then sends it to the bar where she is sitting which she starts drinking.She gets up on stage and gives the guy a lap dance and then asks if he'd like a more private show.  She takes him outside and they start to make out and suddenly she starts biting his neck.  Uh oh, vampires, but not quite, she's actually a ghoul and then all hell starts to break loose.The rest of the movie has a group of 4 people fighting the ghouls and trying to find the queen of the ghouls so that they can stop the spread of the disease.  There are many numerous humorous episodes in between and the film is not meant to be taken seriously.This has some good makeup effects and thankfully doesn't sink into too much CGI.  This is a well made horror comedy, not as well timed as From Dusk to Dawn but still fun in it's own right.  The pacing is a little strange but this film was directed by Joel Shumacher (Lost Boys) so you know it's going to be a quality film.While this is not the greatest horror/comedy movie in the world, it is a very entertaining flick and if you like horror/comedy movies with not an overabundance of gore, this would be the flick for you.",4,Den of Thrills,1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,1915,"['did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'expectations', 'going', 'film', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'watched', 'cable', 'not', 'DVD', 'review.The', 'story', '2', 'college', 'guys', 'traveling', 'Mexico', 'Spanish', 'Fly', 'see', 'sign', 'strip', 'club', 'decide', 'should', 'try', 'out', 'real', 'Spanish', 'Fly', 'tablets', 'strippers', 'place', 'called', 'Devils', 'Den', 'expect', 'see', 'lot', 'overweight', 'strippers', 'what', 'find', 'surprises', 'very', 'much', 'From', 'Dusk', 'Dawn.The', 'story', 'Ken', 'Foree', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'amongst', 'others', 'almost', 'blind', 'patron', 'bifocal', 'glasses', 'woman', 'rather', 'course', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'watching', 'show', 'One', 'guys', 'Spanish', 'Fly', 'strippers', 'beer', 'then', 'bar', 'where', 'sitting', 'drinking.She', 'up', 'stage', 'guy', 'lap', 'dance', 'then', ""'d"", 'like', 'more', 'private', 'show', 'outside', 'start', 'make', 'out', 'suddenly', 'biting', 'neck', 'Uh', 'oh', 'vampires', 'not', 'quite', 'actually', 'ghoul', 'then', 'hell', 'break', 'loose.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'group', '4', 'people', 'fighting', 'ghouls', 'trying', 'find', 'queen', 'ghouls', 'can', 'stop', 'spread', 'disease', 'are', 'many', 'numerous', 'humorous', 'episodes', 'film', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously.This', 'good', 'makeup', 'effects', 'thankfully', ""n't"", 'sink', 'too', 'much', 'CGI', 'well', 'made', 'horror', 'comedy', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'timed', 'From', 'Dusk', 'Dawn', 'still', 'own', 'right', 'pacing', 'little', 'strange', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Joel', 'Shumacher', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'so', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'quality', 'film.While', 'not', 'greatest', 'horror/comedy', 'movie', 'world', 'very', 'entertaining', 'flick', 'like', 'horror/comedy', 'movies', 'not', 'overabundance', 'gore', 'would', 'be', 'flick']",Devil's Den

They want to see if it works so they stumble along a Strip Joint and decide to test it out their. Little do they know they just stumble into a den of Ghouls who feed on human flesh. Ken Foree and Kelly Hu character are both under cover there to find the queen of these beasts and stop them. Well soon after they arrive the Ghouls unveil themselves and the feast begins. The whole story focuses around this strip joint and goes no futher. It has ok acting and pretty good effects. It more of a humorous type horror with  a thin plot. I was expecting  a little more from this film so I gave it only two stars. It might get three if they develop the story better but it really lacks in a lot of departments.

Imagine my surprise when I discovered this is actually a pretty good movie. I admit that it's more than a little cheesy but that's part of what makes it entertaining. I had not seen much from Devon Sawa since Idle Hands (Still one of my favorite movies) and he is pretty good in this movie. The interaction between his character and Kelly Hu's character is one of the main reasons this movie works. I found it very entertaining and have watched more than a few times since I bought it.
