It may help if you have an interest in history, since it takes places in the British Isles around the latter part of the 18th century.  But it opens with two young boys making a pact with each other.  They are good friends in spite of differing social backgrounds.  Their adult lives diverge and taken on different career paths.  But eventually, the two are able to help each other out for the aid of their country.  Tyrone Power of course is the lead Jonathan Blake.  A fellow who works at Lloyd's coffee shop and eventually becomes an insurer himself.  I took several business classes in college and I have to admit, I didn't fully realize the basic principle of insurance until I saw this film.

He is also the (again, fictional) childhood friend of Lord Horatio Nelson, naval hero of the Battle of Trafalgar, where the British turned aside and decisively defeated the combined armada of Napoleonic France and his Spanish allies.

392138,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,6303957072,Muzzlehatch,"[3, 3]","It's pretty easy to understand why Tyrone Power became a huge name given his dramatic presence in this, his first starring role as Jonathan Blake, a 19th century barmaid's son who rises to fame and glory as the top man at the famous early insurance firm while his best pal, Horatio Nelson, goes on to fight Napolean at Trafalgar. Elements of the swashbuckler mingle with some obvious rah-rah pro-England flagwaving and plenty of romantic intrigue; I doubt the insurance industry was so exciting even two centuries past in London, but we can forgive some artistic license here.On hand to provide extra enticements if Power isn't enough are Freddie Bartholomew as Blake's younger version, spotting apparent pirates who are really insurance frauds in the early minutes, which eventually leads him to the position at Lloyd's; C. Aubrey Smith as a typically randy old aristocrat; Madeleine Carroll and Virginia Field as the two women - upper-class and barmaid - vying for his affection; and George Sanders playing the same wonderful sneering scoundrel that he seemed to play in every film but which never gets tiresome.  The production is first-rate ""A"" level grandeur, with director Henry King moving things along nicely amidst the sumptuous sets.  One wonders whether or not this is a film that might have been considered as a Technicolor project, but the early scenes of the boys playing at discovering smugglers looks just right in sharp-toned monocolor.  In any case, if not on the level of the best of the Errol Flynn adventures from this era, worth a look at least and very much deserving of a DVD release.",4,Plenty of star power in this swashbuckler-hymn to the British empire,1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,1608,"['pretty', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'became', 'huge', 'name', 'given', 'dramatic', 'presence', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'Jonathan', 'Blake', '19th', 'century', 'barmaid', 'son', 'who', 'fame', 'glory', 'top', 'man', 'famous', 'early', 'insurance', 'firm', 'best', 'pal', 'Horatio', 'Nelson', 'fight', 'Napolean', 'Trafalgar', 'Elements', 'swashbuckler', 'mingle', 'obvious', 'rah-rah', 'pro-England', 'flagwaving', 'plenty', 'romantic', 'intrigue', 'doubt', 'insurance', 'industry', 'was', 'so', 'exciting', 'even', 'two', 'centuries', 'London', 'can', 'forgive', 'artistic', 'license', 'here.On', 'hand', 'provide', 'extra', 'enticements', 'Power', ""n't"", 'enough', 'are', 'Freddie', 'Bartholomew', 'Blake', 'younger', 'version', 'spotting', 'apparent', 'pirates', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'insurance', 'frauds', 'early', 'minutes', 'eventually', 'position', 'Lloyd', 'C.', 'Aubrey', 'Smith', 'typically', 'randy', 'old', 'aristocrat', 'Madeleine', 'Carroll', 'Virginia', 'Field', 'two', 'women', 'upper-class', 'barmaid', 'vying', 'affection', 'George', 'Sanders', 'playing', 'same', 'wonderful', 'sneering', 'scoundrel', 'seemed', 'play', 'film', 'never', 'tiresome', 'production', 'first-rate', 'A', 'level', 'grandeur', 'director', 'Henry', 'King', 'moving', 'things', 'along', 'nicely', 'sumptuous', 'sets', 'One', 'not', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'Technicolor', 'project', 'early', 'scenes', 'boys', 'playing', 'discovering', 'smugglers', 'just', 'right', 'sharp-toned', 'monocolor', 'case', 'not', 'level', 'best', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'era', 'look', 'least', 'very', 'much', 'deserving', 'DVD', 'release']",Lloyd's of London VHS
392139,A2YT63K4RSOCFC,6303957072,Robert E. Henry,"[1, 1]","Conspicuous by its absence in the American DVD market is ""Lloyd's of London,"" the blockbuster classic that launched Tyrone Power instantly into the stratosphere of movie stardom. Yet it has not been released to US customers, a fact that defies all film-marketing logic. To wit: is there or is there not a large following of classic movies? Does ""Lloyd's of London"" qualify as a major contender in this genre? Is it or is it not highly entertaining in terms of plot, script, acting, directing, cinematography, and star power? Does it not avoid being ""dated"" in its ability to entertain? In my opinion, the answer to these questions is consistently ""Yes,"" causing me to wonder just how a clear winner is withheld from DVD release.Simply put, ""Lloyd's of London"" is emblematic of that glorious type of movie that allows us to escape the concerns of the workaday world and the miseries of political polarization and a generally sour political climate pervading our planet and engage in that lovely state of make believe that is one of the functions of movies. This film is admirably executed by a host of Hollywood's best -  Tyrone Power, Madeleine Carroll, Freddie Bartholomew, George Sanders, and Una O'Connor, to name a few - and an excellent cast throughout. The scenery is marvelous and captured to perfection. In fact, this delightful film is well directed, has an engaging plot and script, indeed all the trappings of quality entertainment that ensures it will transport us from our unhappy era into the mists of yesteryear, where we had hope that innovations like the kind described in Lloyd's could transform our world into a reasonable world of hope for opportunity and progress.To be sure, Hollywood played around with the historical facts - hardly unusual and certainly no reason for excluding it from contention. And while I find this habit pointless and annoying, given the inherent power of history to excite without reinventing the facts, I occasionally overlook producers' creative license and enjoy the final production if it is quality entertainment (which has the virtue of inducing some viewers to look up the historical facts, since we all know that Hollywood tinkers with history on a regular basis).This movie scores too admirably on these points to justify its exclusion from the American market, and its absence is a marketing absurdity. What, is there a dearth of Tyrone Power, Madeleine Carroll, and Freddie Bartholomew, George Sanders, and Una O'Connor fans? I eagerly await the industry to wake up and provide American viewers access to this enjoyable film. Let's go, boys! You have a winner here that's being kept locked up in the stables. Bring it out into the air where it belongs.

Jones,"[11, 13]","Freddie Bartholomew steals each scene he's in during the first half-hour or so of this lavish production, and then he grows up into Tyrone Power and we forget him until the very last scene.This was the film that made Tyrone Power a star.  With all the costumes and the historical names being used and the moral clash of patriotism and monetary gain, the plot's more than a little leaden at times, and we're left to ponder if the end does in fact justify the means.  The plot sometimes lectures, sometimes enlightens, but mostly yawns for two hours.It takes someone with considerable charm to all but carry such a film, and that's just what Tyrone Power does.  The character of Johnathan Blake is that much more likeable and sympathetic because of him.  And top it all off with his famous good looks, which the camera made sure to capture, and you have yourself the birth of a star.This isn't at all one of the best historical movie ever made, but it's worth the viewing for Tyrone Power fans, if only for the close-ups.

It helps that the film is set in the 18th and early 19th Centuries and the climactic financial battle is Tyrone Power's attempt to keep insuring British shipping at the old price while his former colleagues want the admiralty to split the fleet so they can do convoy duty to protect their investment, something Power could never allow since one Horatio Nelson was his childhood friend back in the days when he was young Freddie Bartholomew. To keep things boiling over until then there's his complicated romance with Madeleine Carroll, who he helps escape from Bonaparte's France and whose caddish husband George Sanders (in the first of his many sneer-offs with Power) wants in on Power's syndicates while things are going well and to destroy him when he finds out that Carroll has invested her entire fortune with him. But while Power may give Sanders a bit of ammunition when he finally commits a bit of fraud and high treason, it's not for personal gain but for England, so that's alright.It's an extremely well crafted picture as you might expect from director Henry King, and it's a surprisingly decent attempt at portraying the chaos and energy of 18th Century England that's aided by a budget big enough to do its subject matter some justice: the sets for Lloyd's original coffee house and later more lavish offices are particularly well designed and well used, so it's no surprise that William S. Darling's art direction was Oscar nominated along with Barbara McLean's editing. There's a decent supporting cast, including Guy Standing as Power's mentor, C. Aubrey Smith as a lecherous old courtier, Virginia Field as the barmaid carrying a torch for our hero as well as the expected walk-on cameos from historical figures like Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Johnson and the Prince of Wales. Although fourth billed after Bartholomew, Carroll and Standing, this was Power's first starring vehicle and despite the machinations of the fledgling insurance industry hardly seeming a box-office slam-dunk it's no surprise it was popular enough to guarantee his stardom even if at times it seems as if cinematographer Bert Glennon is going out of his way to make him look prettier than his leading lady. It may not be the classic that the studio was hoping for but it still stands up as fine entertainment today.There are no extras on Fox's Spanish PAL DVD (the only territory it has been released to date) but it does offer a decent black and white transfer with the original English soundtrack and removable Spanish subtitles.",4,Well crafted and surprisingly entertaining with a star-making performance from Tyrone Power,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,2902,"['want', 'proof', 'past', 'different', 'country', '30s', 'were', 'more', 'innocent', 'age', 'as', 'far', 'movies', 'went', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'better', '1936', 'Lloyd', 'London', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'hero', 'fight', 'insurance', 'premiums', 'central', 'drama', 'try', 'getting', 'away', 'today', 'particularly', 'wake', 'infamous', 'Lloyd', 'Names', 'scandal', 'film', 'set', '18th', 'early', '19th', 'Centuries', 'climactic', 'financial', 'battle', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'attempt', 'keep', 'insuring', 'British', 'shipping', 'old', 'price', 'former', 'colleagues', 'want', 'admiralty', 'split', 'fleet', 'can', 'do', 'convoy', 'duty', 'protect', 'investment', 'something', 'Power', 'could', 'never', 'allow', 'one', 'Horatio', 'Nelson', 'was', 'childhood', 'friend', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'Freddie', 'Bartholomew', 'keep', 'things', 'boiling', 'then', 'complicated', 'romance', 'Madeleine', 'Carroll', 'who', 'escape', 'Bonaparte', 'France', 'caddish', 'husband', 'George', 'Sanders', 'first', 'many', 'sneer-offs', 'Power', 'Power', 'syndicates', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'well', 'destroy', 'when', 'out', 'Carroll', 'invested', 'entire', 'fortune', 'Power', 'may', 'give', 'Sanders', 'bit', 'ammunition', 'when', 'finally', 'bit', 'fraud', 'high', 'treason', 'not', 'personal', 'gain', 'England', 'alright.It', 'extremely', 'well', 'crafted', 'picture', 'might', 'expect', 'director', 'Henry', 'King', 'surprisingly', 'decent', 'attempt', 'portraying', 'chaos', 'energy', '18th', 'Century', 'England', 'aided', 'budget', 'big', 'enough', 'do', 'subject', 'matter', 'justice', 'sets', 'Lloyd', 'original', 'coffee', 'house', 'later', 'more', 'lavish', 'offices', 'are', 'particularly', 'well', 'designed', 'well', 'used', 'surprise', 'William', 'S.', 'Darling', 'art', 'direction', 'was', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Barbara', 'McLean', 'editing', 'decent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Guy', 'Standing', 'Power', 'mentor', 'C.', 'Aubrey', 'Smith', 'lecherous', 'old', 'courtier', 'Virginia', 'Field', 'barmaid', 'carrying', 'torch', 'hero', 'as', 'well', 'expected', 'walk-on', 'cameos', 'historical', 'figures', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Samuel', 'Johnson', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'fourth', 'billed', 'Bartholomew', 'Carroll', 'Standing', 'was', 'Power', 'first', 'starring', 'vehicle', 'machinations', 'fledgling', 'insurance', 'industry', 'hardly', 'seeming', 'box-office', 'slam-dunk', 'surprise', 'was', 'popular', 'enough', 'guarantee', 'stardom', 'even', 'times', 'cinematographer', 'Bert', 'Glennon', 'going', 'way', 'make', 'look', 'prettier', 'leading', 'lady', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'classic', 'studio', 'was', 'hoping', 'still', 'up', 'fine', 'entertainment', 'are', 'extras', 'Fox', 'Spanish', 'PAL', 'DVD', 'only', 'territory', 'been', 'released', 'date', 'offer', 'decent', 'black', 'white', 'transfer', 'original', 'English', 'soundtrack', 'removable', 'Spanish', 'subtitles']",Lloyd's of London VHS
