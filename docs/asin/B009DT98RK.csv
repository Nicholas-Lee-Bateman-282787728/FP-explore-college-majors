Seems like yesterday I was watching a much younger Peter Frampton doing his live show at the ""Day on the Green"" concert held at the Oakland Coliseum back in 1976. About the only thing that has changed is the length of his hair. His guitar playing has only improved over the years.The first part of this concert is a complete run-through of his historic ""Frampton Comes Alive"" album that in essence captapulted Peter into instant super-stardom back in 1976. Many memorable tunes here all done with an energy and love that shows Peter still enjoys playing this stuff. His self-deprecating sense of humor(lack of hair, etc.) shows his personable side and keeps you entertained. The band is solid and the keyboardist really cranks it up a notch on ""Do You Feel Like I Do"".The second half of the show is, I assume, Peter's more recent works. To put it bluntly, Peter smokes like I've never seen him play before. This guy hasn't missed a beat in all these years and his chops are smokin hot. Lots of extended guitar solos and the band does a great job keepin up with Mr. Frampton. He even has his son Julian come out and sing a couple........VERY touching and he's actually quite the talent himself. It's obvious that Peter is a VERY proud papa.As far as the video and sound quality goes..... it's top notch, first rate. The audio is especially well mixed, clean and full sounding and nothing seems to overpower or seems missing in this high-def blu-ray mix. Highly recommended.",5,"Buy it for nostalgia, enjoy it for the music",1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,1490,"['how', 'time', 'flys', 'Seems', 'yesterday', 'was', 'watching', 'much', 'younger', 'Peter', 'Frampton', 'doing', 'live', 'show', 'Day', 'Green', 'concert', 'held', 'Oakland', 'Coliseum', 'back', '1976', 'only', 'thing', 'changed', 'length', 'hair', 'guitar', 'playing', 'only', 'improved', 'years.The', 'first', 'part', 'concert', 'complete', 'run-through', 'historic', 'Frampton', 'Comes', 'Alive', 'album', 'essence', 'captapulted', 'Peter', 'instant', 'super-stardom', 'back', '1976', 'Many', 'memorable', 'tunes', 'here', 'done', 'energy', 'love', 'shows', 'Peter', 'still', 'playing', 'stuff', 'self-deprecating', 'sense', 'humor', 'lack', 'hair', 'etc', 'personable', 'side', 'entertained', 'band', 'solid', 'keyboardist', 'really', 'up', 'notch', 'Do', 'Feel', 'Do', '.The', 'second', 'half', 'show', 'assume', 'Peter', 'more', 'recent', 'works', 'put', 'bluntly', 'Peter', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'play', 'before', 'guy', ""n't"", 'missed', 'beat', 'years', 'chops', 'are', 'smokin', 'hot', 'Lots', 'extended', 'guitar', 'solos', 'band', 'great', 'job', 'keepin', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Frampton', 'even', 'son', 'Julian', 'out', 'sing', 'couple', 'touching', 'actually', 'quite', 'talent', 'obvious', 'Peter', 'VERY', 'proud', 'papa.As', 'far', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'top', 'notch', 'first', 'rate', 'audio', 'especially', 'well', 'mixed', 'clean', 'full', 'sounding', 'nothing', 'overpower', 'missing', 'high-def', 'blu-ray', 'mix', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
