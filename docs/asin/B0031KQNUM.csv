If you like disaster action type films you will definitely like this one. Check out the synopsis- A heat wave, a devastating tennis ball size hail storm, and a dead farmer all leave the local police mystified; but for experienced Meteorologist's, January Berger, these are warning signs to a bigger natural disaster. A relentless storm is about to hit the center of town and with no advanced warning system in place residents are left to fend for themselves! As the massive twisters rip a path of destruction though the city, will anyone make it out alive?Check out more info about the film at: [...]*Sponsored Post",4,Disaster Film With A Heart,1265760000,"02 10, 2010",2010,756,"['Not', 'bad', 'film', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'family', 'storyline', 'made', 'feel', 'characters', 'when', 'came', 'face', 'face', 'huge', 'tornados', 'like', 'disaster', 'action', 'type', 'films', 'will', 'definitely', 'one', 'Check', 'out', 'synopsis-', 'A', 'heat', 'wave', 'devastating', 'tennis', 'ball', 'size', 'hail', 'storm', 'dead', 'farmer', 'leave', 'local', 'police', 'mystified', 'experienced', 'Meteorologist', 'January', 'Berger', 'are', 'warning', 'signs', 'bigger', 'natural', 'disaster', 'relentless', 'storm', 'hit', 'center', 'town', 'advanced', 'warning', 'system', 'place', 'residents', 'are', 'left', 'fend', 'massive', 'twisters', 'rip', 'path', 'destruction', 'city', 'will', 'anyone', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'Check', 'more', 'info', 'film', '[', ']', '*Sponsored', 'Post']",F4: Vortex

The conflict between father and son was not the best written. That I think comes from the dubbing and the writting of the movie.

Thiis was like those 1950s flics, when you had no idea who was speaking: they all sounded alike. Also, it took 45 minutes before I had any idea who the main characters were. There was no story line, just random events with differing characters. Finally, we got some characters, but very uninteresting ones. The menage a trois was the big story!A waste.
