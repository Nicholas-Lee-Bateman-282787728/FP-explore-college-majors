I wanted to see if this one was more my speed.Jillian is highly instructional and encouraging in this DVD. There is a friendly, helpful atmosphere. She's a regular chatterbox, talking us through each move and giving suggestions and recommendations. The workouts are in sections, each demonstrated by one of the contestants from past episodes of The Biggest Loser. These are not people with 'perfect' model bodies, so it was less intimidating. They were once unable to do these, so there is hope for me. Jillian ""assigns"" several short exercises and then they do them several times, often demonstrating (with a sense of humor) several options viewers can use as they get stronger.I took advantage of the sections using weights, since I haven't used them for a long time and wanted to start again as a beginner. I don't do jumping jacks or push-ups, but after seeing them demonstrated here in such a non-threatening way, maybe I might try the push-ups one of these days.I like this DVD. It isn't overwhelming.

I told him when he started that, that kind of work out will get him hurting and that he needs to start slow, Once he looses weight a bit and increases muscle mass he can do p 90, which in my opinion should not be done by overweight people sure there are those success stories, but they don't always turn out good.  It's always best to start slow and learn how to exercise once you do that then you can try harder things, Oh and if your still gaining weight then, you have to start counting calories I know is a hassle to do, but if your working out and not loosing weight, that can only mean your eating (possibly) more due to your increase activity, this is one thing that people over look the most, the fact that when you work out  your body well get hungry, this is where the calorie counting will help reduce the amount of food you eat,  Most people after working out feel is ok to eat because they have work out but the problem is that you end up eating more after work out then you would with out them, so in essence your sabotaging yourself.",4,for my bro in law,1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,1248,"['bought', 'video', 'two', 'more', 'i', 'wanted', 'bro', 'law', 'work', 'out', 'heavy', 'side', 'started', 'using', 'p90', 'exercises', 'were', 'too', 'much', 'stress', 'ankles', 'knees', 'told', 'when', 'started', 'kind', 'work', 'out', 'will', 'get', 'hurting', 'start', 'slow', 'Once', 'weight', 'bit', 'muscle', 'mass', 'can', 'do', 'p', '90', 'opinion', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'done', 'overweight', 'people', 'sure', 'are', 'success', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'turn', 'out', 'good', 'always', 'best', 'start', 'slow', 'learn', 'how', 'exercise', 'once', 'do', 'then', 'can', 'try', 'harder', 'things', 'Oh', 'still', 'gaining', 'weight', 'then', 'have', 'start', 'counting', 'calories', 'know', 'hassle', 'do', 'working', 'out', 'not', 'loosing', 'weight', 'can', 'only', 'mean', 'eating', 'possibly', 'more', 'due', 'increase', 'activity', 'one', 'thing', 'people', 'look', 'most', 'fact', 'when', 'work', 'out', 'body', 'well', 'get', 'hungry', 'where', 'calorie', 'counting', 'will', 'help', 'reduce', 'amount', 'food', 'eat', 'Most', 'people', 'working', 'out', 'feel', 'ok', 'eat', 'have', 'work', 'out', 'problem', 'end', 'up', 'eating', 'more', 'work', 'out', 'then', 'would', 'out', 'so', 'essence', 'sabotaging']",Jillian Michaels for Beginners - Frontside / Backside
1024127,A1QYFBUNNFV8D7,B000J10KN2,CG,"[5, 5]","I have had this DVD for about a month now and I love it.  The first couple times through it was difficult but I am already mastering the moves and getting stronger.  I still feel some muscle soreness the day after I do them as well as find myself a bit shaky for a few hours that same day.  Here are the pros follwed by the cons I have found since owning it.Pros:Two workouts for the price of one.Focus on front or back side muscles or an all over workout if you go through both in one day.Jillian is VERY instructive which helps if you are not sure how to perform the move.  She also shows you more difficult ways to perform the moves as you become more advanced.Each DVD contains 6 circuits so you have control over what you do.Already I have gotten stronger and go for more reps and more advanced forms of the move.Can be combined with other workouts to up the calorie burn since it is not overly exhausting in itself.Here are the cons:I wear a HRM when I workout and I find that individually you only burn around 350 - 400 calories for each DVD.  Therefore i usually do them together which burns around 600-750 calories but takes 1 and 1/2 hours to complete without stopping.Once you get used to doing the moves you easily get ahead of the people on the DVD so I find myself finishing a circuit and having to skip forward to the next one.There is no music.Overall I would recommend this workout for those who want to start a strength routine and are nto sure how or where to begin.

You need an x-ertube and weights; anything else is optional.  So this makes this easy to do.  You don't need heaps of space, but to make it easier still, probably best to alternate these (unless it's a weekend day where you may have lots of time to put them together - that would be a fantastic workout).  One thing that experienced home workout exercisers will notice big time, is that there is no music.

It is more of a warm up then a workout but it's always good to warm up before working out anyways so if you want something to warm up with before going to a gym or one of her hardcore DVDs then this is it.
