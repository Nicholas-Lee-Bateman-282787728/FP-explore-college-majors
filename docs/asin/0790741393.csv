The framing and tone of scenes such as the flower in the workplace walkway, the embrace of the dog outside the doctors office, and the many-times-mentioned luggage shop purchase, all show a beautifully light and meaningful touch by director Shanley and actor Hanks.  The scene that best sums up my unequivocal love of this movie however is the simple scene of Joe dancing to the song ""Come go with me"" on his steamer trunk raft.  Here he is along, adrift, and convinced of his impending death... finally... truly... enjoying life!

Then I remember the movie hitting the video stores -- again, not much action.It  was only after I saw this film on broadcast TV (I didn't see it at the  theater or on video) that I realized that, well, it wasn't all that bad.  In fact, it's quite fun.Hanks plays Joe Banks, a hypocondriac stuck in a  dreadful job, working for an intolerable boss when he learns that he has an  incurable disease.  Soon thereafter he is approached by a wealthy  businessman who recruits him to jump into a volcano on a remote Pacific  island.  Well, why not, I'm dying anyway.  And that's when he starts to  live.Travel, adventure, and watch for Meg Ryan in three different roles  in the movie!This is one fun show.  Why do I like it? I'm not quite  sure.  Do I like it though, yes, absolutely.  It has aspects of romantic  comedy, drama (sort of), misadventure, and a realization of the importance  of life and of living it.  For some reason it took me the longest time to  catch the message of the movie, &quot;...along a crooked  road.&quot;Watch for Abe Vigoda as the native chief.A talented cast  has great fun with this story line that to some appears to have no point.  If you don't see a point in it...so what!  It's fun.  And if you do see a  point in it, it's still fun.Give this often overlooked movie a try.  I  think you'll like it.  It contains hints of the market appeal of future  Hanks-Ryan romantic comedies such as &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; and  &quot;You've got Mail.&quot;I'm not quite sure why, but this movie  gets 5 stars in my book.

109036,A23L2BR07AOBG1,0790741393,alex bushman,"[4, 4]","This is also the first teaming of  the two and it really gives the characters they play something to think about.  The reason this film is the best of them all is because it's not really a romantic comedy, it's a comedy about a man's existence in general. Although every relationship with Ryan's three characters has a romantic overtone to it, the film is a little more deep in it's understanding of what makes a relationship work because Joe doesn't end up with two of the characters Ryan plays.  Other reviewers have found the movie has homages and allusions to other famous and classic literature and film; This doesn't surprise me considering it's the only film both written and directed by the intelligent modern playright, John Patrick Shanley.  He also includes various symbols within the film that are incredibly obvious and easy for a general audience to catch, but I can imagine many people not noticing them and thinking the film is a strange, simple, dumbed down, romantic comedy.  The way I look at the film is that it should work for all audiences, but for those who are studious enough to catch the humorous homages, it can be extremely funny.  I don't know what the line about the doll being the chief's soul is about, but it gets me every time. I think it might just be how the exchange between the two that works so well: Joe-What's that? Chief-It is my soul. Joe-Oh, well then I hope you don't lose it.  Chief-So do I!This movie is just so goofy.  I hope if you're reading this review that you at least go out, rent the movie, and have seen it. Then you can say that you've experienced it because I feel that this film reaches a creative peak and individuality that most Hollywood films don't get to.

Tom Hanks is a down-on-his-luck guy who gets fired from his job and diagnosed with a fake terminal illness, only to be duped into promising to jump into a volcano by a wealthy mining tycoon. Meg Ryan plays 3 parts, but most convincingly that of Hanks' cruise director and principal love interest. Add to that a raft of everything-proof luggage and an unstable island full of orange soda-guzzling natives and watch the romantic comedy hijinks ensue!As far as these types of movies go, it's pretty standard fare. The movie is low budget enough so that you can rule out any real technical innovation, and was done at a time when both Hanks and Ryan were at that uncertain point in their careers when they were considered competent without being particularly bankable. True to typecasting, Hanks is the earnestly striving everyman and Ryan is sweet and charming, and they go through the most gosh-darned amazing things to end up falling in love.If nothing else, it's interesting to see Hanks before triumphs like &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, and realize that he was as good then as he is now, if much less appreciated.Like others have said here: you either love this movie or you hate it.

109045,ALC3LG8YTNHU3,0790741393,"Bruce Barker ""Risingsnow""","[0, 5]","I really wanted to like this film.I saw it in theaters when it was first released and absolutely hated it. Over the years however, I've grown to respect Tom Hanks as an actor in even his most insipid early films. He is one of the rare actors that is able to elevate the script to higher levels with his rather vast collection of skills. It is the rare Hanks film that I'm unable to truly enjoy.I've also enjoyed most of Meg Ryan's work and feel she's been underutilized and pigeon-holed into romantic comedy roles. If you think I'm crazy in this assessment, I suggest you watch her marvelous performance in ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" if you would like to get a glimpse into the surprising depth she has as an actress.In addition, the movie has a huge number of cameo and near-cameo appearances by some of the truly great character actors of the time. Ossie Davis, Abe Vigoda, and even a young Nathan Lane, each leave their fingerprints on the finished product. In fact, in many cases the supporting roles outshine the performances of the lead actors.However, Meg Ryan stinks up this movie in each of her three roles. Her accent comes and goes with annoying frequency and the only thing that makes it possible to see them as remotely separate characters is the variety of hair colors. Each has the same mannerisms, facial expressions, and moral outlook. In fact, each is ready to be sexually intimate with Hanks even though only one of them has known him for more than a day. Even then, her first character - a coworker of Hanks - is ready to sleep with him on the first date until she learns of his ""fatal"" illness. I understand the symbolism represented - all three represent Hanks' true love so he sees them the same, etc. - but Ryan could have added so much to the film by simply maintaining the characters as individuals instead of falling in and out of each character throughout the film.The direction and cinematography are ham-handed. The beginning of the film is supposed to be dark and brooding. If the rain, puddles, ponderous soundtrack remake of Tennessee Ernie Ford's ""16 Tons, and the grey monolithic building aren't enough to set that mood for you, don't worry. Almost everyone is dressed in grey and black and looking down at the ground as if the weight of the world were on his or her shoulders.Almost every frame of the film is similarly drenched in one symbolic image or another. Nothing is subtle. Perhaps at the time of release this was considered innovative filmmaking, but a viewing of any one of the Cohen Brothers' films will show how this can be done properly without slapping the viewer in the face with constant lightning bolt images and the other 3 million contrivances the director inserts into this ""lighthearted fable.""There is a moment, roughly 2/3 of the way into the film, where Hanks watches the moon rise over the ocean.

109050,AUHG8KSHI529U,0790741393,Craig Matteson,"[4, 4]","This is an utterly dumb cartoon of a movie.  Or is it?  Look more closely.In my view of things, the very artificiality of the movie helps us get at what is real in its story.  This is a statement against living an ordinary life out of fear and learning to live life fully without being afraid to, well, jump into a volcano.  Is that a stupid ethos?  Probably.  However, think about the most wonderful things that have happened to you?  Did you really know what was going to happen when you took the leap?The movie opens up with sickly lighting and everyone heading into an awful place for work.  The place is seasick green and old meat grey and full of these awful barely working fluorescent lights and a mid-level boss, Mr. Frank Waturi, who is clearly an insane monster (played perfectly by Dan Hedaya).  Joe, being a hypochondriac, spends his meager salary on doctors and finds out that while his symptoms mean nothing, he is dying of a ""brain cloud"".  This brain cloud has no symptoms and will cause no problems for 5 months and then about six months from the diagnosis his brain and then his body will fail.He goes back to the office and gives his central soliloquy, a really nice piece about the lights sucking the juice out of his eyes and how he sold his life for $300 a week because he was too afraid to live it.  The rest of the movie is about him learning to live it.Yet, everything about the movie, including the marvelous scene where he buys these ridiculous steamer trunks and their subsequent role in the movie, is ridiculous.  Even the hammerhead shark would look bad in a high school video.  But this is all the point.  So much of ""reality"" only seems frightening or weighty because of what we make of it inside our own heads.  Even Meg Ryan's three roles in the movie contribute to this point.  They are different women (as different as the cute but modestly talented Ryan can make them) who each have a different effect on Joe, but mostly because of the way Joe is living his life when he meets them.  The stranger the story gets, the closer he gets to the Big Wu and the orange soda loving Waponi's (among whom Abe Vigoda is wonderful, and look for a young Nathan Lane), the more real Joe and his relationship with Patricia gets.The movie has a strange and abrupt ending, but its point being made, there really isn't anything more to say, since it isn't the unreal story of what happens to Joe, but the story of what Joe decides to do, and that is finished.  After all, no matter how much one plans, prepares, and tries to kid oneself about knowing the future, isn't marriage and plunging into the future a lot like jumping into a volcano to see what happens?  What happens to you is quite different than anything you expected or connected at all the reality you were certain of.  In fact, doesn't it all seem kind of foolish after all?  And wonderful?This movie won't be for everyone, but I liked it and its artificiality telling a real story behind the story.",4,Maybe what scares us about reality isn't real after all,1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,2981,"['utterly', 'dumb', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'Look', 'more', 'closely.In', 'view', 'things', 'very', 'artificiality', 'movie', 'get', 'what', 'real', 'story', 'statement', 'living', 'ordinary', 'life', 'fear', 'learning', 'live', 'life', 'fully', 'being', 'afraid', 'well', 'jump', 'volcano', 'stupid', 'ethos', 'Probably', 'However', 'think', 'most', 'wonderful', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'Did', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'when', 'took', 'leap', 'movie', 'up', 'sickly', 'lighting', 'everyone', 'heading', 'awful', 'place', 'work', 'place', 'seasick', 'green', 'old', 'meat', 'grey', 'full', 'awful', 'barely', 'working', 'fluorescent', 'lights', 'mid-level', 'boss', 'Mr.', 'Frank', 'Waturi', 'who', 'clearly', 'insane', 'monster', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'Joe', 'being', 'hypochondriac', 'meager', 'salary', 'doctors', 'out', 'symptoms', 'mean', 'nothing', 'dying', 'brain', 'cloud', 'brain', 'cloud', 'symptoms', 'will', 'cause', 'problems', '5', 'months', 'then', 'six', 'months', 'diagnosis', 'brain', 'then', 'body', 'will', 'fail.He', 'back', 'office', 'central', 'soliloquy', 'really', 'nice', 'piece', 'lights', 'sucking', 'juice', 'eyes', 'how', 'sold', 'life', '300', 'week', 'was', 'too', 'afraid', 'live', 'rest', 'movie', 'learning', 'live', 'it.Yet', 'everything', 'movie', 'including', 'marvelous', 'scene', 'where', 'ridiculous', 'steamer', 'trunks', 'subsequent', 'role', 'movie', 'ridiculous', 'Even', 'hammerhead', 'shark', 'would', 'look', 'bad', 'high', 'school', 'video', 'point', 'So', 'much', 'reality', 'only', 'frightening', 'weighty', 'what', 'make', 'own', 'heads', 'Even', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'three', 'roles', 'movie', 'contribute', 'point', 'are', 'different', 'women', 'as', 'different', 'cute', 'modestly', 'talented', 'Ryan', 'can', 'make', 'who', 'have', 'different', 'effect', 'Joe', 'mostly', 'way', 'Joe', 'living', 'life', 'when', 'stranger', 'story', 'closer', 'Big', 'Wu', 'orange', 'soda', 'loving', 'Waponi', 'whom', 'Abe', 'Vigoda', 'wonderful', 'look', 'young', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'more', 'real', 'Joe', 'relationship', 'Patricia', 'gets.The', 'movie', 'strange', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'point', 'being', 'made', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'more', 'say', ""n't"", 'unreal', 'story', 'what', 'Joe', 'story', 'what', 'Joe', 'do', 'finished', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'one', 'plans', 'prepares', 'tries', 'kid', 'knowing', 'future', ""n't"", 'marriage', 'plunging', 'future', 'lot', 'jumping', 'volcano', 'see', 'what', 'What', 'quite', 'different', 'anything', 'expected', 'connected', 'reality', 'were', 'certain', 'fact', ""n't"", 'seem', 'kind', 'foolish', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'liked', 'artificiality', 'telling', 'real', 'story', 'story']",N/A

His life is miserable. He is always sick, he is afraid to stand up to his boss or ask the pretty girl in the office out on a date.Taking advantage of his vulnerability, a greedy industrialist uses a doctor to convince Joe he has a terminal illness, then uses that situation to persuade Joe to go to a small South Pacific island and jump into a volcano, appeasing their gods. The islanders will in turn give the mining rights on their island to the industrialist.The news of his impending death sets Joe free. He is suddenly bold, confident and open to asking all the important questions.On the way to the island, he falls in love with the daughter of the industrialist. She wants to marry him, and decides to jump into the volcano with him.When they jump into the volcano, it spits them out a couple of miles into the water and the island sinks into the ocean. Miraculously they survive this unlikely vault from the fiery pit.Of course, Joe's luggage, four enormous steamer trunks, survive and pop out of the water right next to Joe and Patricia. They corral the trunks, tie them together, and sit atop their makeshift raft awaiting rescue. Patricia figures out her father's scheme and informs Joe that he is not dying of a ""brain cloud."" Once Joe realizes he has to live the rest of his life, and that he has been duped, his throat begins to close up and he starts feeling bad again.I have two general comments about the movie:1) There is a scene, where a delirious Joe (from dehydration and sunstroke) hallucinates at night and sees all the constellations as cartoonish characters. This was a beautiful, dreamy scene, but it only lasted a few seconds. I felt they should have explored the animated scene in the night sky and spent more time with it. A disappointment for me.2) The Waponi Woo, the people of the island with the volcano, are all too cowardly to volunteer to jump in the volcano to save their tribe. Joe and Patricia show great courage by jumping in the volcano, sacrificing themselves for others. Joe and Patricia are spared, while all the islanders perish when the volcano explodes and sinks the island. It is as if Joe and Patricia are rewarded for their courage, and the Waponi Woo are all destroyed because of their cowardice. A lesson for all of us.",5,An Escapism Movie if ever there was one  **Spoiler Alert**,1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,2463,"['**Spoiler', 'Alert**Among', 'many', 'great', 'movies', 'favorite', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'movie', 'Meg', 'Ryan', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', '.Joe', 'Banks', 'hypochondriac', 'near-death', 'experiences', 'fireman', 'life', 'miserable', 'always', 'sick', 'afraid', 'stand', 'up', 'boss', 'ask', 'pretty', 'girl', 'office', 'out', 'date.Taking', 'advantage', 'vulnerability', 'greedy', 'industrialist', 'doctor', 'convince', 'Joe', 'terminal', 'illness', 'then', 'situation', 'persuade', 'Joe', 'go', 'small', 'South', 'Pacific', 'island', 'jump', 'volcano', 'appeasing', 'gods', 'islanders', 'will', 'turn', 'give', 'mining', 'rights', 'island', 'industrialist.The', 'news', 'impending', 'death', 'sets', 'Joe', 'free', 'suddenly', 'bold', 'confident', 'open', 'asking', 'important', 'questions.On', 'way', 'island', 'love', 'daughter', 'industrialist', 'marry', 'jump', 'volcano', 'him.When', 'jump', 'volcano', 'out', 'couple', 'miles', 'water', 'island', 'ocean', 'Miraculously', 'survive', 'unlikely', 'vault', 'fiery', 'pit.Of', 'course', 'Joe', 'luggage', 'four', 'enormous', 'steamer', 'trunks', 'survive', 'water', 'right', 'next', 'Joe', 'Patricia', 'corral', 'trunks', 'tie', 'together', 'sit', 'atop', 'makeshift', 'raft', 'awaiting', 'rescue', 'Patricia', 'out', 'father', 'scheme', 'informs', 'Joe', 'not', 'dying', 'brain', 'cloud', 'Once', 'Joe', 'live', 'rest', 'life', 'been', 'duped', 'throat', 'close', 'up', 'feeling', 'bad', 'again.I', 'have', 'two', 'general', 'comments', 'movie:1', 'scene', 'where', 'delirious', 'Joe', 'dehydration', 'sunstroke', 'night', 'constellations', 'cartoonish', 'characters', 'was', 'beautiful', 'dreamy', 'scene', 'only', 'lasted', 'few', 'seconds', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'explored', 'animated', 'scene', 'night', 'sky', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'disappointment', 'me.2', 'Waponi', 'Woo', 'people', 'island', 'volcano', 'are', 'too', 'cowardly', 'volunteer', 'jump', 'volcano', 'save', 'tribe', 'Joe', 'Patricia', 'show', 'great', 'courage', 'jumping', 'volcano', 'sacrificing', 'others', 'Joe', 'Patricia', 'are', 'spared', 'islanders', 'perish', 'when', 'volcano', 'explodes', 'island', 'Joe', 'Patricia', 'are', 'rewarded', 'courage', 'Waponi', 'Woo', 'are', 'destroyed', 'cowardice', 'lesson']",N/A

Hanks, still early into his burgeoning film career, hits two wildly exaggerated extremes in his portrayal of Joe, the hopeless working stiff who learns he's got roughly six months to live and rediscovers the miracles of spontaneity. Behind the film's absurd premise and a few witty, hilarious caricatures lies a pointed, layered look at the trappings of modern society and the gray fog we spew around ourselves to cope with our dull nine-to-five schedule. It's an original take on the message, and one which is constantly reinforced by a quirky, distinct visual style and playful personality.

But, on second viewing a decade later, I now think it is silly enough to warrant several words.This is, first and foremost, a fairy tale. There isn't a shred of realism to it, nor was there any attempt to foist it off as realistic. Joe Banks, an unhappy hypochondriac stuck in a job working PR for a factory making petroleum jelly (Home of the Anal Probe), is diagnosed with a ""Brain Cloud"" and given six months to live. Almost immediately, he is offered a job as a human sacrifice. When told he can ""live like a king for six months, and die like a man!"" Joe replies, ""Sure."" The rest of the plot moves on in predictable fashion. Joe is handed six credit cards, spends like mad, is flown out to LA, shipped to the South Pacific and falls in love with Meg Ryan no less than three times. (""You know, the first time I saw you, I thought that I'd seen you before."")The movie has some truly hilarious moments. When Joe and Patricia (Meg Ryan) finally reach the Waponi Island, where Joe is to jump into the volcano, they are greeted with a chorus of Hava Nagila. (The Waponis are a hilarious mix of Keltic, Jewish and Polynesian.) There are lovely cameos--Carol Kane as the hairdresser (only for a second, but it was worth it). And Ossie Davis is a show-stopper as the chauffeur. Lloyd Bridges did a great job as the hard-driving millionaire who dupes Joe into jumping into the volcano, and Dan Hedaya is memorably unbearable as Joe's insufferable boss. (""I'm not arguing with you! Who told you that? I'm not arguing with you!"")The last scene, ""Wherever we go, whatever we do, we're gonna take this luggage with us,"" was priceless.But the reason I enjoyed this movie so much the second time round was not because the story was sweet, or the lines funny, or because Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks make a cute couple, but for one scene alone. Joe is standing on his luggage, stranded in the middle of the ocean, dying of thirst when the full moon rises. What he says at that moment, dwarfed by the hugeness of the moon, made the whole film more than just a quirky little fairy tale. ""I forgot how big..."" he says, in tones of pure awe. That one moment beautifully expresses the point of this movie. At one time or another in our humdrum little lives, we forget 'how big', and long to get ""away from the things of man.""

A comedy.""Seriously, who would WANT to watch a movie described like that?  I certainly didn't until I got badgered into it by someone who insisted it was great.It is now my favorite movie.The reason I say that not even screenwriter and director John Patrick Shanley realized what he had is because he published his original screenplay:Moonstruck, Joe Versus the Volcano, and Five Corners: Screenplays,...and it is stomach-turning-ly awful.  The original ending, which he actually filmed (!) and only replaced when test audiences reacted with sheer hatred, would have absolutely ruined the movie.  An early cut scene in which Joe (Tom Hanks) Banks meets and interacts with a Roman Catholic priest on his flight from NY to LA is equally nauseating.  There may be others; I've never had the stomach to read further!  So credit Mr. Shanley with the original idea (and the good sense to listen to people who pointed out the horrors in his original screenplay), but that's about it.(The only similar case I'm aware of is the transformation of William Goldman's hideously awful novelThe Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventureinto the wonderful movieThe Princess Bride, which Goldman actually wrote the screenplay for!)So if it wasn't the genius of Mr. Shanley, whose was it?Start with the premise.  Shanley is playing around with so many classic storytelling archetypes that one assumes he MUST have studied Joseph Campbell's seminalThe Hero with a Thousand Facesor at least some edition of Christopher Vogler's application of Campbell's ideas to the specific task of screenwritingThe Writers Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers, 3rd Edition, but at its core this story of a man who doesn't learn how to live until he learns that he is dying preaches the gentle but so oft needed today message toLive Like You Were Dying.  The movie also preaches a gentle message against materialism, but it is nuanced by the fact that Joe's most frivolous purchases end up saving his and Patricia's lives on more than one occasion.Tom Hanks gives the best all around performance (comedy AND drama) of his career, and Meg Ryan manages to play THREE separate characters brilliantly and convincingly (most actors and actresses struggle with two) in the first of their pairings.  A number of Hollywood's greats contribute small but memorable performances: Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack, Abe Vigoda, Carol Kane, and in particular Ossie Davis.  Barry McGovern puts in an unforgettable performance as a slightly obsessed luggage salesmen; Dan Hedaya puts in a similarly brilliant performance as the World's Worst Boss.  Georges Delerue contributed a pitch perfect musical score:Joe Versus the Volcanofor one of his very last works, and the selection of classic songs used to underscore pivotal scenes (unfortunately never released as a soundtrack album) is one of the best chosen (and most eclectic) I've ever heard: ""Sixteen Tons"", ""Ol' Man River"", ""On the Street Where You Live"", ""Mas Que Nada"", ""Blue Moon"", ""Good Lovin'"", ""Come Go with Me"", and ""I Cover the Waterfront"".Like any great movie there are truly great scenes that you never forget: The Beginning (going to work), The Diagnosis, Joe's Resignation, Joe's Date with DeDe, The Meeting with Graynamore, The NY Shopping Spree with Marshall, The Luggage Salesman, Joe and Angelica in LA, the Boat Ride, The Storm, The Raft, The Island, The Volcano, and The End.  What makes this movie so remarkable is that this list of truly great scenes comprises the ENTIRE movie; the only NON-great scenes are to be found unused in Shanley's original screenplay.Because it was such a critical and box office bomb fans have been deprived of a lot of things they'd have gladly purchased.  The score had only limited release, the soundtrack, none.  No reproduction of the music box lamp prop was ever made, and assuming they weren't completely fantasizing about the features of his trunks, somebody missed a bet not introducing a line of luggage based upon it: ""I tell you one thing, though. Wherever we go, whatever we do, we're gonna take this luggage with us!""Everyone with a soul owes themselves at least one viewing of this movie to see if they are susceptible to its magic.Watch it

""Joe"" is an endlessly weird, imaginative, and achingly romantic comedy about heroism, fear, hope and longing. It has a big heart and an old-fashioned grandeur (like something from MGM in the '50's) that lends it a sparkling kind of mysticism. Hanks and Meg Ryan (in three completely different roles) obviously put a lot of trust in writer-director John Patrick Shanley, and he rewards them by never allowing them to look silly (even while on an island in the Pacific ruled by Abe Vigoda!). The film seems to harken back to a more innocent time--maybe from youth--and it plays with the lead character's innocence and naivete in very sly and funny ways.

109083,A189COFU9UUX2L,0790741393,Joseph M. Patane,"[4, 4]","This movie has become my favorite movie of all time. I have given it a rating of E, which is the highest that I will give to a movie or book. To receive this rating, there has to be substance, meaning, consistency of story and plot, depth, and it must be unforgettable.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants not just entertainment, but a challenge to find the messages this movie is saying to each viewer. There is a connectivity throughout the movie that makes it well worth viewing several times to pick out. I will not go into details, for that would make it too easy and spoil the fun to be had in searching. They are there, words, moments of insight, pictures, and ideas. They are there, find them, and enjoy.I think the choice of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan was the best choice for this movie. Both do very creditable acting. There is also a lot of frisson between these two characters which adds immeasurably to this movie.One of the things that you will find in this movie is what simple love is and how important it is. By simple love I mean the power of the touch of hands, the giving of oneself to keep another safe and well, the look within the eyes that says ""I care for you"". These are all simple things, but powerful too. Hence, their meaning comes across powerfully within the framework of this movie.I have seen this movie several times and I am still seeing things that connect throughout the movie. This makes it more fun to watch time and again, because you always will find something new missed before. Spielberg is an excellent director and he knows how to tell a story. The story presented in Joe vs the Volcano is done extremely well in this movie. There is much more to it within the movie than just the interplay of the two main characters. In addition, the music adds a depth to this, a surprising depth. I have tried to find the sound track and it is not available. Only 3500 CD's were made and these are gone to those who likewise found it to be something worth keeping.There are unforgettable scenes throughout the movie too. One in particular I always see in my mind and thoughts. Tom Hanks (Joe)and Meg Ryan are on a raft after the sail boat that Meg was captain of sunk in a storm. Meg suffered a blow to the head and is unconscious so Joe gives her water to keep her well, denying any for himself because he does not know when they will be rescued. About the third night he sees the moon rise. At one point he struggles to stand and it then appears he is holding the moon up with his hands. It is touching, an unforgettable scene.

109084,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,0790741393,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[4, 4]","""Joe Versus the Volcano"" is an interesting little film, light and silly on one level, yet infused with complex themes and more than a little darkness, too.  Though much of the movie is set in a gritty, urban landscape, the story has a fable-like, ""once upon a time..."" quality throughout.  But again, the darkness and complexity often gives that fable-like quality more of a Brothers Grimm flavor.I finally watched this movie after having it sit on my shelves for several years, thinking it would probably be ""just okay"", so there was no rush in getting to it.  But I was wrong.  This combination love story and meditation on life turned out to be a thoughtful little bugger, with some memorable imagery and occurrences.  I will say that the ending sequences could have benefitted from a bigger special effects budget, though nothing ever approached outright shoddy work.Meg Ryan was very good in her three diverse roles, making me wonder why she only played cute and perky roles during most of her subsequent career, with a late career detour primarily comprised of unsavory, darkly sexual characters.  This movie showed she could create interesting characters existing between those two poles.  Tom Hanks was also good, displaying some early acting chops as he effectively communicated the vast range of reactions and emotions required of his character.My standard DVD (a 2001 remastering, I believe) looked and sounded perfectly fine, and a few modest special features were included.  Perhaps a better DVD of this film has been released since I bought this particular edition, but if not, this one is still quite serviceable.By the way, the director of ""Joe Versus the Volcano"", John Patrick Shanley, also directed 1987's ""Moonstruck"" and 2008's ""Doubt"", all the while maintaining- even now- a prolific life in the theatre as a playwright/director.

It is a little gem, a fable, a lovely, whimsical dream that allows us to take a look at ourselves and the lives we lead. If I had to recommend one movie that has ""important"" things to say, it would be ""Joe Versus the Volcano.""In this Odyssey, Joe Banks, the movie's main character, realizes he has to change his life after finding out he has a ""brain cloud."" Visited by Samuel Graynamore, played by the wonderful Lloyd Bridges, he is given a chance to ""live like a king and die like a hero"" if he will agree to jump into a volcano on a Polynesian Island. Thus begins a fairy tale journey to the ""Big Woo."" His crooked road there leads him to a new understanding of life, a new appreciation of the world, true love, and the importance of one's soul. Joe learns that in life you must choose between being asleep or awake. As Patricia (Meg Ryan) says in the movie:""My father says almost the whole world's asleep.Everybody you know, everybody you see, everybody you talk to.He says only a few people are awake.And they live in a state of constant, total amazement.""""Joe Versus the Volcano"" teaches that you can go through this world alive and yet not be alive. Like Joe, you can be dead and walking around. But it also teaches that you can change all of that if you really want to. All you need to do is have a little faith and the courage to take some risks. To quote Patricia again:""Nobody knows anything, Joe.We'll take this leap, and we'll see.We'll jump, and we'll see.That's life, right?""Many thanks to John Patrick Shanley, who wrote, directed, and infused this charming film with a rich tapestry of recurring symbols. Here are a few to look for when you watch JVTV: nautical symbols, the volcano, ducks, the rose, the big dog, Joe's hats, the zigzag, closed and open hands, the moon, and many others. Although silly at times, at heart, this lovely movie is showing us how we can live our lives well. I ""tip my hat"" to Mr. Shanley. ""May you live to be a thousand years old, sir.""I also want to thank the production crew and the wonderful actors who worked so hard to make JVTV special. Meg Ryan, who plays three different characters, gives her best performance in this ""little"" movie - what a marvelous job of acting. Tom Hanks is the perfect Joe Banks and the supporting actors are superb: Ossie Davis, who plays Marshall; Barry McGovern, who plays the luggage salesman; Lloyd Bridges, who plays Samuel Graynamore; Abe Vigoda, who plays the Waponi Chief; Dan Hedaya, who plays Frank Waturi, Carol Kane, who plays Cassandra, the hair dresser, and many others - thanks for such a wonderful film. I would also be remiss if I didn't tender a special thanks to the late Georges Delerue for his hauntingly beautiful original music score. ""Marooned Without You"" will always be one of my favorite songs.This movie is like no other, and you can go to it again and again to lift your spirits and renew your soul. It will whisper its beguiling sea-song to you, if you listen.So, let Joe, Patricia, and the gang show you how to leap into that volcano and enjoy this most lovely of movies.Good luck, and have a great ""journey.""",5,"Enchanting, Whimsical, Profound - A Most Special Movie",1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,3202,"['treasure', 'movie', 'enchanting', 'blend', 'comedy', 'fantasy', 'philosophy', 'little', 'gem', 'fable', 'lovely', 'whimsical', 'dream', 'take', 'look', 'ourselves', 'lives', 'lead', 'had', 'recommend', 'one', 'movie', 'important', 'things', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'Joe', 'Versus', 'Volcano', 'Odyssey', 'Joe', 'Banks', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'change', 'life', 'finding', 'out', 'brain', 'cloud', 'Visited', 'Samuel', 'Graynamore', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'given', 'chance', 'live', 'king', 'die', 'hero', 'will', 'agree', 'jump', 'volcano', 'Polynesian', 'Island', 'Thus', 'fairy', 'tale', 'journey', 'Big', 'Woo', 'crooked', 'road', 'new', 'understanding', 'life', 'new', 'appreciation', 'world', 'true', 'love', 'importance', 'one', 'soul', 'Joe', 'life', 'must', 'choose', 'being', 'asleep', 'awake', 'Patricia', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'movie', 'father', 'almost', 'whole', 'world', 'asleep.Everybody', 'know', 'everybody', 'see', 'everybody', 'talk', 'to.He', 'only', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'live', 'state', 'constant', 'total', 'amazement', 'Joe', 'Versus', 'Volcano', 'can', 'go', 'world', 'alive', 'yet', 'not', 'be', 'alive', 'Joe', 'can', 'be', 'dead', 'walking', 'around', 'also', 'can', 'change', 'really', 'want', 'need', 'do', 'have', 'little', 'faith', 'courage', 'take', 'risks', 'quote', 'Patricia', 'again', 'Nobody', 'anything', 'Joe.We', ""'ll"", 'take', 'leap', ""'ll"", 'see.We', ""'ll"", 'jump', ""'ll"", 'see.That', 'life', 'right', 'Many', 'thanks', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'infused', 'charming', 'film', 'rich', 'tapestry', 'recurring', 'symbols', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'look', 'when', 'watch', 'JVTV', 'nautical', 'symbols', 'volcano', 'ducks', 'rose', 'big', 'dog', 'Joe', 'hats', 'zigzag', 'closed', 'open', 'hands', 'moon', 'many', 'others', 'silly', 'times', 'heart', 'lovely', 'movie', 'showing', 'how', 'can', 'live', 'lives', 'well', 'tip', 'hat', 'Mr.', 'Shanley', 'May', 'live', 'be', 'thousand', 'years', 'old', 'sir', 'also', 'want', 'thank', 'production', 'crew', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'who', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'JVTV', 'special', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'who', 'three', 'different', 'characters', 'best', 'performance', 'little', 'movie', 'what', 'marvelous', 'job', 'acting', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'perfect', 'Joe', 'Banks', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'who', 'Marshall', 'Barry', 'McGovern', 'who', 'luggage', 'salesman', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'who', 'Samuel', 'Graynamore', 'Abe', 'Vigoda', 'who', 'Waponi', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'who', 'Frank', 'Waturi', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'who', 'Cassandra', 'hair', 'dresser', 'many', 'others', 'thanks', 'wonderful', 'film', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'remiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'tender', 'special', 'thanks', 'late', 'Georges', 'Delerue', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'original', 'music', 'score', 'Marooned', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'songs.This', 'movie', 'other', 'can', 'go', 'again', 'again', 'lift', 'spirits', 'renew', 'soul', 'will', 'whisper', 'beguiling', 'sea-song', 'listen.So', 'let', 'Joe', 'Patricia', 'gang', 'show', 'how', 'leap', 'volcano', 'enjoy', 'most', 'lovely', 'movies.Good', 'luck', 'have', 'great', 'journey']",N/A

The story is about a guy who finds himself in a job he hates working for a boss that sheds dandruff like a snowstorm. The job Joe has in the film he says he could do in five minutes and take the rest of the month off. So because Joe doesn't like his job he becomes a regular hypochondriac. In fact Joe is always taking off to go see his doctor about something. His boss doesn't like it. But is this all there is about this film? No it gets going after a few more scenes and everybody goes on a sea voyage. If I would tell you what comes next I would spoil the surprise. But here is a tidbit: don&#8217;t forget the luggage Joe buys! It is the top of the line and a regular lifesaver! You will see it in quite often throughout the movie. The soundtrack is fabulous! I loved it! Then Joe toward the end of the movie replies to a question of where they are going or where he wants to end up and he says, &#34;... anywhere away from the things of man.&#34; I know I have felt that way at one point or other in my life but I have pushed on with a stiff upper lip. Well, Joe.... Hey see the movie and Joe will not only tell you but show you what he does. I gave it five stars because I liked the acting, the cast, the soundtrack, the luggage and so much more.

I find the soundtrack of the movie beautiful and haunting with its' fabolous main theme, but in fact I have no idea if it was intended to have that effect, giving a melancolich-feel (half sad, half dreamy). This story being as unrealistic and (as mentioned) ""fablish"" as it may be, well, I still can't help taking it serious based on the fact that the story is containing the deepest emotions around the tragedy of loneliness in the characters we get introduced here to. The movie is full of personality and charm. But this including also the despair (this is about a man who is lost in life) -and the lead character (Joe) first learns to appreciate his life when he is told he has only six months left to live. he becomes the young man he used to be ""full of piss and vinegar"" as he himself says it. He somehow wakes from a nightmarish state of mind, and to be frankly of the US. Some traumatic events working as a fireman in his past made him become a worried and hypocondriac (correct spelled?) man until this.The movie and the story being so different, gripping in its' ""surrealness"" -and so well acted by the entire cast is what makes it so great!As you might have realized I find it far more than being just a peculiar comedy, it takes you out of the dark and tells us there is far more to this life, this world, than the machineries of mankind, the buildings and the work. There is more to life than all this, and it's out there, and it shouldn't go to waste.

Maybe it could be described as an allegory for escaping the drudgery of life, or something like that, but at any rate it's pleasant to watch, at times profound, at other times funny.The beginning 3rd is about Joe (Tom Hanks) struggling with hypochondria and a lousy, really crummy job, primarily because of the dreary work environment and the typical (oppressive) supervisor (Dan Hedaya). (I've been there myself, when I worked at Pines Mfg H&H; Tooling and again at Toro, where everyone was on dope.)  Joe learns from his doctor (Robert Stack, of The Untouchables) that he has a ""brain cloud"" and only a few months to live.  The tone of the movie rises as Joe quits his job and we feel like impending death is the best thing that's ever happened to him. He takes a former co-worker (Meg Ryan) to dinner and seems to wake up to life for the first time.The next day billionaire Lloyd Bridges (Airplane) enters Joe's life with a bizarre proposition:  Since he's dying anyway, why not literally jump into a volcano - for the billionaire's own financial motive - and live it up with unlimited credit at the his expense in the meantime.  Joe accepts and in his journey to the volcanic island learns about how to live life from helpful chauffeur Ossie Davis (The Client) and the billionaire's two daughters - both played by Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle), which makes a total of 3 roles for her in this great movie, making it even more pleasant to watch!",5,"Funny, visually aesthetic, relevant, and insightful.",1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,1639,"['Joe', 'Versus', 'Volcano', 'rare', 'blend', 'comedy', 'insight', 'romantic', 'enough', 'girls', 'funny', 'enough', 'guys', 'effective', 'visual', 'symbolism', 'appropriate', 'whole', 'family', 'Maybe', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'allegory', 'escaping', 'drudgery', 'life', 'something', 'rate', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'times', 'profound', 'other', 'times', 'funny.The', 'beginning', '3rd', 'Joe', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'struggling', 'hypochondria', 'lousy', 'really', 'crummy', 'job', 'primarily', 'dreary', 'work', 'environment', 'typical', 'oppressive', 'supervisor', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', ""'ve"", 'been', 'when', 'worked', 'Pines', 'Mfg', 'H', 'H', 'Tooling', 'again', 'Toro', 'where', 'everyone', 'was', 'dope', 'Joe', 'doctor', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'Untouchables', 'brain', 'cloud', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'live', 'tone', 'movie', 'Joe', 'job', 'feel', 'impending', 'death', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'happened', 'former', 'co-worker', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'dinner', 'wake', 'up', 'life', 'first', 'time.The', 'next', 'day', 'billionaire', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'Airplane', 'Joe', 'life', 'bizarre', 'proposition', 'dying', 'anyway', 'why', 'not', 'literally', 'jump', 'volcano', 'billionaire', 'own', 'financial', 'motive', 'live', 'up', 'unlimited', 'credit', 'expense', 'meantime', 'Joe', 'accepts', 'journey', 'volcanic', 'island', 'how', 'live', 'life', 'helpful', 'chauffeur', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'Client', 'billionaire', 'two', 'daughters', 'played', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'total', '3', 'roles', 'great', 'movie', 'making', 'even', 'more', 'pleasant', 'watch']",N/A

You see, it's a subtle movie; a fairy-tale, not the typical hamfisted one-liner ""comedy"" people expect from Hollywood.  This reflects a personal vision and craftsmanship rare in mainstream cinema, that of ""Moonstruck"" creator J. P. Shanley (writer/director) and uncompromised by the committee process of typical filmmaking.  Ryan shines in a triple role (itself an allegory) and Hanks was never more personable as the Everyman Joe Banks, trapped in the deadest of deadend jobs (anyone ever stuck in a truly miserable job, with surreal surroundings and pyschopathic bosses, will relate to the opening scenes) and then told he has a ""brain cloud"", a terminal illness.  ""I'm losing my sole/soul"" Joe says sadly, looking at his worn out shoes but actually reflecting on a  life going down the tubes.  This film is loaded with joyous ephipanies (""Most people you meet are asleep, and the ones that are awake live in a state of constant, total amazement"") and significant surprise revelations, as should be the way with fairy tales. Standout performances from Lloyd Bridges, Dan Heydaya, Abe Vigoda, Ossie Davis push the story along and provide Joe with a surrounding cast of characters to help or confound him (Bridges' Trickster figure, Mr. Graynamore, is particularly delightful). As Joe makes his literal odyssey (the Quest imagery is very strong permeates this film) to the island of Waponi Woo, there to confront his destiny, we are treated to a series of funny vignettes and comedy interludes that together bring Joe to a new awareness.  This dense, layered, carefully constructed  and deeply spiritual movie (which is not to say it isn't funny as hell in places)  has a dedicated cult following, and deservedly so.

He shows a much greater range of acting ability  than he has in any other film.  Meg Ryan is equally amazing, playing three  very different roles convincingly.

Somehow he finds the courage to take that step.

Prabhaharan,"[7, 7]","I try to watch this film at least once a year, because it reminds me of  what is truly important in life and what are only passing sensations. I  first watched it as a teenager after having been mesmerised by Tom Hanks in  &quot;Big&quot;, and at that point in time I appreciated all the quirky  jokes and scenes, but was not mature enough to see deeper. On repeated  viewings as an adult I kept seeing more and more meanings in the film, and  its central message - don't let the economic pressures of life destroy your  capacity for wonder and hope - became more and more resonant. This film  together with &quot;Big&quot; is for me Tom Hanks's greatest and most  inspiring performances. It is a hallmark of his style that he is able to  move and entertain you at the same time, almost effortlessly. Although he  subsequently became a very famous &quot;serious&quot; actor, in my opinion  he was never more serious than when he played these quirky roles. Meg Ryan  is equally inspired to give a great performance, though I never realised  she played 3 parts until my sister told me ! The film, like all great  films, has an extremely simple, you could say silly plot. But it is filled  with superb, subtle comic scenes with a dazzling array of cameo appearances  by the support cast. There are then a series of reflections on what life is  and what it could be, with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan giving different points  of view. There are some lyrical, dreamy songs in the film which fit  perfectly with the introspective nature of the dialogue. The film is full  of moving moments, my favourite is when Joe marooned sees the moon rising  in the South Pacific for the first time, and though he faces almost certain  death, all he can think of at that moment is how beautiful it is, and  despite the rotten life he has been handed, thanks God for this moment. One  senses all his sadness and disappointment with life being washed away by  this simple vision. If perhaps you are not too happy with your job or life,  and have become depressed about it, watch this film. I cannot promise it  will make your troubles go away, but I think it may help you to see life  differently, It certainly did for me ! In my opinion, this film ranks with  the Capra classic &quot;Its A Wonderful Life&quot; in its resonant message  of hope and courage in facing the unknown. One laughs, is moved and finally  inspired - and this is what great art is about isn't it. The film also  teaches you to never judge a video by its cover !",5,"Sad songs, moonlight and the meaning of life",965692800,"08 8, 2000",2000,2509,"['try', 'watch', 'film', 'least', 'once', 'year', 'what', 'truly', 'important', 'life', 'what', 'are', 'only', 'passing', 'sensations', 'first', 'watched', 'teenager', 'having', 'been', 'mesmerised', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'quot', 'Big', 'quot', 'point', 'time', 'appreciated', 'quirky', 'jokes', 'scenes', 'was', 'not', 'mature', 'enough', 'see', 'deeper', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'adult', 'kept', 'seeing', 'more', 'more', 'meanings', 'film', 'central', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'economic', 'pressures', 'life', 'destroy', 'capacity', 'wonder', 'hope', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'resonant', 'film', 'together', 'quot', 'Big', 'quot', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'greatest', 'most', 'inspiring', 'performances', 'hallmark', 'style', 'able', 'move', 'entertain', 'same', 'time', 'almost', 'effortlessly', 'subsequently', 'became', 'very', 'famous', 'quot', 'serious', 'quot', 'actor', 'opinion', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'serious', 'when', 'played', 'quirky', 'roles', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'equally', 'inspired', 'give', 'great', 'performance', 'never', 'realised', 'played', '3', 'parts', 'sister', 'told', 'film', 'great', 'films', 'extremely', 'simple', 'could', 'say', 'silly', 'plot', 'filled', 'superb', 'subtle', 'comic', 'scenes', 'dazzling', 'array', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'support', 'cast', 'are', 'then', 'series', 'reflections', 'what', 'life', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'giving', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'are', 'lyrical', 'dreamy', 'songs', 'film', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'introspective', 'nature', 'dialogue', 'film', 'full', 'moving', 'moments', 'favourite', 'when', 'Joe', 'marooned', 'moon', 'rising', 'South', 'Pacific', 'first', 'time', 'almost', 'certain', 'death', 'can', 'think', 'moment', 'how', 'beautiful', 'rotten', 'life', 'been', 'handed', 'thanks', 'God', 'moment', 'One', 'sadness', 'disappointment', 'life', 'being', 'washed', 'away', 'simple', 'vision', 'perhaps', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'happy', 'job', 'life', 'have', 'become', 'depressed', 'watch', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'promise', 'will', 'make', 'troubles', 'go', 'away', 'think', 'may', 'help', 'see', 'life', 'differently', 'certainly', 'did', 'opinion', 'film', 'Capra', 'classic', 'quot', 'A', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'quot', 'resonant', 'message', 'hope', 'courage', 'facing', 'unknown', 'One', 'laughs', 'moved', 'finally', 'inspired', 'what', 'great', 'art', 'about', ""n't"", 'film', 'also', 'never', 'judge', 'video', 'cover']",N/A

You can argue with one another about whether the best part of the movie is the opening sequence of Joe's really lousy job; or his diagnosis with a brain cloud; or Lloyd Bridges' over-the-top performance as Mr. Graynamore (Gray No More, get it?) the man who hires Joe to jump into the volcano; or Ozzie Davis' memorable chauffeur; or the LUGGAGE SCENE; or (my personal vote) the scene where Joe falls to his knees before the giant rising moon and says ""Dear God, whose name I do not know.  Thank you for my life.  I forgot how BIG!""  You'll marvel at the richness of the screenplay in which it seems every line is laden with meaning.  You'll find yourself watching the film over and over and over again, finding new details hidden within each scene.  Just read the many five-star reviews below to get a feel for the richness that awaits you if you turn out to be a pro-Joe.If you are already a pro-Joe and you are wandering through this review wondering whether or not you should get the DVD, the answer is obvious.  Since you're a pro-Joe, your videotape is going to wear out pretty soon anyway, right?  Plus, you'll want to have the widescreen version.  There are a few minor extras (a brief interview piece; a music video; a preview) - but those are just bonuses.

Tom Hanks is wonderful as the downtrodden, workaday ""Joe"" who finally takes control of his life.  Meg Ryan is her usual sparkling self in not one, but THREE roles in the film.  Her amazing personality filters through each of the three characters in different amounts, making us believe that she is all three of the characters.The film has wonderful visual treats, my favorite being the the ""dancing on the trunks"" scene.  The soundtrack is fabulous (I've been looking for it for ages!), and the cameos by Carol Kane and Ossie Davis add a marvelous dimension to the film.If you haven't seen the film and want to be surprised, don't read further- just buy it!!!Joe is an everyday guy with a healthy dose of hypochondria.  His doctor convinces him that he has a ""brain cloud"" that will prove fatal in the near future.  As a result, he is convinced to jump into the volcano of a south seas island - he gets a little adventure (first class) and the requisite evil guy gets the mineral rights to the island.  From the first moment Joe is told he has a ""brain cloud"", several things happen.  The audience keeps thinking ""BRAIN CLOUD - GET A SECOND OPINION!"", and faced with his imminent demise, Joe finally finds his backbone during the ensuing adventures.  Meg Ryan's characters include a shrinking violet in his office, and twin daughters of the ""evil guy"" who assist him in his journey. The ending is all that you would expect from a fairy tale, but to tell more would ruin your fun!It's a wonderfully fun adventure, replete with visual treats including a sea voyage, a tropical island (Tom Hanks in a tux on the island is NO slouch!!!), and Orange Soda!

109133,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,0790741393,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[8, 9]","I love this movie for many reasons. First, it's my favorite movie starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (I never could get into Sleepless in Seatle or You've Got Mail). Second, it's definitely one of the top 10 most romantic movies I've ever seen. But probably the real reason why I love this movie is the reason for repeat viewing that most people miss.Let me tell you about two of my favorite types of movies. On the one hand, you have movies that try to take the fantastic (alien invasions, monsters, time travel, magic) and make it seem real. On the other hand, you have movies that try to take the ""real world"" and make it seem fantastic. This movie defintely falls into the latter category. It's not set in a far off land long ago, the main characters aren't knights and damsels in distress. Or are they???Take a close look, listen carefully to the dialog. What is never quite spelled out, but often hinted at... is the fact that this IS a fairy tale. Our hero Joe starts out in this movie like a brave knight (he was a fireman who rescued people remember) who has been captured and imprisoned in a dark dungeon (his terrible job). He is tricked into believing his life is over by the mountain king (the head of a company looking for a rare earth element), and offered great riches (life of luxury for a short while) in exchange for slaying the evil dragon (jumping into the volcano). Of course along the way he meets a beautiful princess (Meg Ryan) and love ensues.This movie is a perfect example of an old story told in an interesting and unique way. Seemingly everyone in this story is a strange and lovably character, and the theme of a love that keeps trying to find you is bound to appeal to anyone who considers themself a true romantic.The wonderful mood setting music and excellent color photography are just the icing on the cake for this interesting, heart warming, funny, (deep?) feel-good movie. Everyone should at least see this movie once. And now that it's on dvd and you can finally see it widescreen the way it was meant to be seen.

There were three of us, and I think each of us was there to kill time and perhaps escape the heat.  Having seen the previews, and judging from the name, I was expecting a mediocre, superficial, silly comedy.  I was in the mood for that, so I would have had no complaints.From almost the beginning of the movie I was shocked, not only was this not silly, superficial, or mediocre, it also was all three.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder was never more pertinent.  If all you could see was the obvious, yes, it was a silly, superficial, and mediocre movie.  Shockingly this is all the reviewers were able to see.  For anyone who was awake (and in constant amazement, which happily was true for this film), the movie was incredible on every level.  The dialogue was so true, so real, and so full of feeling.  It was impossible to know what they were going to say next, the cliches were all gone.  The cinematography and symbolism were everywhere and engaging throughout the movie.  The artistry in creating visual sets that magnified the dialogue and mood is nothing short of sublime.  The movie is never rushed either, it focuses more on making the scenes work, making sure you get a strong feeling from all of them.  Art must evoke emotions, and this movie is truly a piece of art.I would recommend this movie to anyone who really likes movies and is interested in the profound subtlety and immense detail put into each scene.

It rocks; the song, the situation, and the set work perfectly.But, further along with the review.It's about a hypochondriac named Joe Banks. He had had a job before, putting out fires, but for the past several years he's had a job shipping out catalogues for a medical parts company. He uses up basically all of his salary on doctors' bills, because, being the hypochondriac he is, he won't rest until he finds something wrong with himself. And- wonder of all wonders- one doctor FINALLY tells him he has an uncurable disease- a 'brain cloud' that will kill him in the next six months. Joe feels great about that; quits his job, and takes out the secretary he had to dinner.

Well, I've seen it many times and just love it, as it never fails to make me laugh. I also see all kinds of rather profound and deep stuff hidden in this quirky story. There are lots of interesting details that probably go over the head of the majority of viewers. Oh well. 'BRAIN CLOUD'! It's like the movie exists in it's own particular space of understanding, and you have to be within that same sphere to 'get it'. Apparently, not many people are, as it appears this movie was a big flop at the box office and was universally panned by the critics. In my opinion, that alone makes it worth going out of your way to see!One of my favorite scenes is in the openning scenes with Mr. Waturi. ""I know he can get the job, but can he DO the job?"" Haven't we all had a moronic boss like that, repeating himself ad nauseum, talking incessantly on the phone to make himself feel important? He's absolutely perfect in that role. ""I'm not arguing that with you!!!"", he screams repeatedly. He's actually an archetype of a very real phenomena in the everyday workplace. There really are people just like him out there! In fact, most all the characters in this movie are unabashed character exagerrations. The humor in it is such that it is the kind you either 'get' or you don't 'get'. One time, at a family gathering I brought a video of the movie over, excited to share it with all of them after dinner. Well, before it got 30 minutes into the film, one by one they all excused themselves from the room! Nobody else laughed! Not even once! (Except for me of course, who was rolling on the floor). Go figure!The film has has a great cast: Meg Ryan plays (very convincingly) the parts of the three main female roles wonderfully. Tom Hanks plays his usual lovable self as 'Joe Banks' who has a pragmatic death wish. Lloyd Bridges plays the billionaire Greyamore, with his duck headed walking stick as he smashes it into walls. Just beautiful! Mr. Waturi is an absolute piece of work, and that demented luggage salesman, whoever he is, is a classic among all movie characters!  The look in this guy's beady, slightly cross-eyed face as he say's, ""Ah, a real.... Journey!"" (hands rubbing in anticipation of the outrageous commission) is worth the price of admission alone.Quirky details: 'Jump' orange soda! Gotta love it! ""I've forgotten how 'BIG'!"" Throughout the movie, there are repeated symbols popping up. Like the logo of the disgusting 'Acme' company Joe works for. (""50 years of petrolium jelly""). The movie opens with Joe and his coworkers trudging along this crooked walkway (to the tune of Tennessee Ernie Ford's 'I owe my soul to the company store') shaped in the symbol of a lightening bolt which we later notice is the company logo. Of course, this ill-conceived pathway makes the workers walk about 5 times more distance than would otherwise be necessary if it were an efficient design, but that's the corporate world for you! Interestingly, we see this same symbol repeated in other scenes and contexts throughout the film, like the march up the volcano with tourches at night. Clever! Not only is movie funny, but there are lots of layers to it.  It's revealing of human nature, of the dichotomy of the 'artificial' and the 'real' and also has moments that are quite serious and touching in the depth of the underlying message. One such moment is at one point when Joe is close to death after the shipwreck on the ocean, in his weakness he is awakened to a spiritual realization of the preciousness and enormity of life. There is alot of very profound meaning that underscores the quirky comedy in this film. Therein lies it's real brilliance.This really is an 'odd duck' of a movie, as it doesn't really know if it's a satire, a comedy, an offbeat drama, or what. But that's precisely why I think it's great and why it works. Highly recommended for repeat viewings.",5,ah.... a real...

Until a few months ago anytime I asked someone about this film, they said the hated it. A few months ago I caught the opening scene on cable. I was intrigued. In less than fifteen minutes, I had watched a comedy that displayed allusions to the silent movie METROPOLIS, the writings of George Orwell, and Plato's allegory of the cave. A few weeks later, I rented the film and fell in love with it.The movie is a modern-day allegory with deep spiritual symbolism and anti-materialism. After watching the movie I was reminded of Dante's DIVINE COMEDY and Bunyan's PILGRIMS PROGRESS.Joe is an everyman of all the classic fairy tales. And make no mistake, this is a fairy tale; it even begins with ""Once upon a time"". His existance is boring and he's afraid he's going to die and he's scared. Things weren't always that way for Joe. He used to have an exciting life as a firefighter. Now, he just exists along with most of other humanity. Then he's told he has a brain cloud and is going to die. That knowledge brings revelation and Joe decides to live and accept his death. In doing so, Joe becomes the person he was always destined to be and he is born again.I admit there's a lot in JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO that I just don't understand, yet. But I'll watch it again and again until I do. They film seems so corny, yet is really quite complex and deep, full of romanticism and myth.The closest Tom Hanks' film that Joe resembles is THE BURBS. That's another film that people either love or hate with no inbetween. However, THE BURBS is more of a scary story (what happens when our greatest fears are actually true) than the everyman, romantic tale that JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO is. Still the styles are somewhat similar and they are both movies that are much more complex than they originally appear to be.JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO is a modern-day fairy tale and like most fairy tales, kids may enjoy it, but they won't understand it. It's a movie that only an adult with a child-like faith will understand. You'll either love it or hate it. However, whatever the case if nothing else, it's worth watching to see Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan on the screen for the first time together.",4,Change of Heart.,1053129600,"05 17, 2003",2003,2278,"['was', 'eighth', 'grade', 'when', 'JOE', 'VERSUS', 'THE', 'VOLCANO', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'Friends', 'who', 'saw', 'film', 'hated', 'few', 'months', 'anytime', 'asked', 'someone', 'film', 'said', 'hated', 'few', 'months', 'caught', 'opening', 'scene', 'cable', 'was', 'intrigued', 'less', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'had', 'watched', 'comedy', 'displayed', 'allusions', 'silent', 'movie', 'METROPOLIS', 'writings', 'George', 'Orwell', 'Plato', 'allegory', 'cave', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'rented', 'film', 'fell', 'love', 'it.The', 'movie', 'modern-day', 'allegory', 'deep', 'spiritual', 'symbolism', 'anti-materialism', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'reminded', 'Dante', 'DIVINE', 'COMEDY', 'Bunyan', 'PILGRIMS', 'PROGRESS.Joe', 'everyman', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tales', 'make', 'mistake', 'fairy', 'tale', 'even', 'Once', 'time', 'existance', 'boring', 'afraid', 'going', 'die', 'scared', 'Things', 'were', ""n't"", 'always', 'way', 'Joe', 'used', 'have', 'exciting', 'life', 'firefighter', 'Now', 'just', 'along', 'most', 'other', 'humanity', 'Then', 'told', 'brain', 'cloud', 'going', 'die', 'knowledge', 'revelation', 'Joe', 'live', 'accept', 'death', 'doing', 'so', 'Joe', 'person', 'was', 'always', 'destined', 'be', 'born', 'again.I', 'admit', 'lot', 'JOE', 'VERSUS', 'THE', 'VOLCANO', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'yet', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'do', 'film', 'so', 'corny', 'yet', 'really', 'quite', 'complex', 'deep', 'full', 'romanticism', 'myth.The', 'closest', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'film', 'Joe', 'BURBS', 'film', 'people', 'love', 'hate', 'inbetween', 'However', 'THE', 'BURBS', 'more', 'scary', 'story', 'what', 'when', 'greatest', 'fears', 'are', 'actually', 'true', 'everyman', 'romantic', 'tale', 'JOE', 'VERSUS', 'THE', 'VOLCANO', 'Still', 'styles', 'are', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'are', 'movies', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'originally', 'appear', 'be.JOE', 'VERSUS', 'THE', 'VOLCANO', 'modern-day', 'fairy', 'tale', 'most', 'fairy', 'tales', 'kids', 'may', 'enjoy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'movie', 'only', 'adult', 'child-like', 'faith', 'will', 'understand', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'However', 'case', 'nothing', 'else', 'worth', 'watching', 'see', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'screen', 'first', 'time', 'together']",N/A

Trapped in a dysfunctional bureaucratic netherworld that evokes Fritz  Lang's Metropolis, bullied and tortured by his interminable boss Mr. Waturi  (Dan Hedaya), hypochondriac Joe Banks (Tom Hanks)is dying a literal slow  and agonizing death when he learns he really IS dying--of a brain cloud!  Thus begins his improbable odyssey from Staten Island to Manhattan to Los  Angeles to a far-flung island in the South Pacific.  What he has previously  only experienced vicariously (the felicitous love of Romeo and Juliet,  Robinson Carusoe), he now lives first-hand!  All the objects and people he  encounters along his merry &quot;crooked path&quot; are intertwined.  Meg  Ryan plays each of the three women (Dee Dee/Angelica/Patricia) he meets  during his passage (he has the recurring odd feeling that he's met each of  them somewhere before).  His first kiss with the soul-sick Patricia amid a  raging typhoon is electrifying!  The movie's soundtrack is superb--the  choices (&quot;16 Tons,&quot; Louis Armstrong's &quot;'Ol Man River,&quot;  and Elvis Presley's soulful &quot;Blue Moon&quot; in particular) are well  made.
