884223,A12SHC9IT3VZQG,B0007O392A,Daniel Sweeney,"[10, 12]","So I was sick all weekend, bedridden with the flu and flipping through cable when I stumbled upon the Encore Western Channel, which I watched for hour after hour. For some reason, they were playing a triple-shot of Burt Reynolds westerns: Navajo Joe, The Man who Loved Cat Dancing and Sam Whiskey.Now I grew up in the Eighties so I missed most of Reynolds movies; last year I hunted down and watched many for which he is best known: Smokey and the Bandit (rip-roaring hilarity), Stroker Ace (yuck), Cannonball Run (meh) and Hooper (my all-time favorite, ridiculously entertaining). I thought I had seen all there was to see from ol' Burt, but Sam Whiskey pleasantly surprised me.This isn't really a western, it's more like a heist movie set on the frontier. I think the reason some of the other reviewers were disappointed by this one was that they were looking for stagecoach robberies, breakneck horseback riding and widescreen Monument Valley-like vistas. While there is some of that, for the most part this film revolves around a ""reverse-heist;"" In this case, Burt and his team played by Ossie Davis(very funny and amiable as a blacksmith) and Clint Walker (imposing hulk of a man who's gentle on the inside) are trying to return some gold to the US mint. They work out a suitably ingenious and ludicrous scheme (the cornerstone for every caper flick) and work it out.While the proceedings are executed largely for laughs there are surprising amounts of edge-of-your-seat suspense as various curveballs are thrown our heroes' way. I have to admit I laughed out loud probably five times, which was incredible considering how miserable I felt and how much my sore throat hurt WHEN I LAUGHED. But I forgive the movie for this! I like the overall good-natured and almost lackadaisic nature of the pacing. The film keeps moving and is engaging, but by no means is it in any hurry.So I would recommend this one to all Burt Reynolds fans, all caper movie fans and generally anyone who is willing to give a 40-year-old easygoing movie a chance.And as an interesting side-note: As if I didn't already realize that I'd watched westerns all weekend -- I thought that actor Clint Walker looked vaguely familiar but couldn't quite place him. They I looked him up on IMDb...he played the icy bad guy in a Charles Bronson western I'd watched earlier in the weekend, ""The White Buffalo."" I hadn't placed him because it was such a polar opposite role for him. So in his career he's pulled a heist on the Denver Mint with Burt Reynolds and got into a gunfight with Charles Bronson on the frontier. Not too shabby.",4,More entertaining than it has any right to be...,1226361600,"11 11, 2008",2008,2600,"['So', 'was', 'sick', 'weekend', 'bedridden', 'flu', 'flipping', 'cable', 'when', 'stumbled', 'Encore', 'Western', 'Channel', 'watched', 'hour', 'hour', 'reason', 'were', 'playing', 'triple-shot', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'westerns', 'Navajo', 'Joe', 'Man', 'who', 'Loved', 'Cat', 'Dancing', 'Sam', 'Whiskey.Now', 'grew', 'up', 'Eighties', 'missed', 'most', 'Reynolds', 'movies', 'last', 'year', 'hunted', 'down', 'watched', 'many', 'best', 'known', 'Smokey', 'Bandit', 'rip-roaring', 'hilarity', 'Stroker', 'Ace', 'yuck', 'Cannonball', 'Run', 'meh', 'Hooper', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'ridiculously', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'had', 'seen', 'all', 'was', 'see', 'ol', 'Burt', 'Sam', 'Whiskey', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'me.This', ""n't"", 'really', 'western', 'more', 'heist', 'movie', 'set', 'frontier', 'think', 'reason', 'other', 'reviewers', 'were', 'disappointed', 'one', 'was', 'were', 'looking', 'stagecoach', 'robberies', 'breakneck', 'horseback', 'riding', 'widescreen', 'Monument', 'Valley-like', 'vistas', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'reverse-heist', 'case', 'Burt', 'team', 'played', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'very', 'funny', 'amiable', 'blacksmith', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'imposing', 'hulk', 'man', 'who', 'gentle', 'inside', 'are', 'trying', 'return', 'gold', 'US', 'mint', 'work', 'out', 'suitably', 'ingenious', 'ludicrous', 'scheme', 'cornerstone', 'caper', 'flick', 'work', 'proceedings', 'are', 'executed', 'largely', 'laughs', 'are', 'surprising', 'amounts', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'suspense', 'various', 'curveballs', 'are', 'thrown', 'heroes', 'way', 'have', 'admit', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'probably', 'five', 'times', 'was', 'incredible', 'considering', 'how', 'miserable', 'felt', 'how', 'much', 'sore', 'throat', 'hurt', 'WHEN', 'LAUGHED', 'forgive', 'movie', 'overall', 'good-natured', 'almost', 'lackadaisic', 'nature', 'pacing', 'film', 'moving', 'engaging', 'means', 'hurry.So', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'fans', 'caper', 'movie', 'fans', 'generally', 'anyone', 'who', 'willing', 'give', '40-year-old', 'easygoing', 'movie', 'chance.And', 'interesting', 'side-note', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'realize', ""'d"", 'watched', 'westerns', 'weekend', 'thought', 'actor', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'looked', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'place', 'looked', 'up', 'IMDb', 'played', 'icy', 'bad', 'guy', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'western', ""'d"", 'watched', 'earlier', 'weekend', 'White', 'Buffalo', 'had', ""n't"", 'placed', 'was', 'such', 'polar', 'opposite', 'role', 'So', 'career', 'pulled', 'heist', 'Denver', 'Mint', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'got', 'gunfight', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'frontier', 'Not', 'too', 'shabby']",N/A
