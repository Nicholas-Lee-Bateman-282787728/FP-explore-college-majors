102418,ANGH6401L9Y0T,0790733935,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","Warren Beatty's big break! He plays Bud Stamper, top jock and son of the richest man in a small town in 1928 Kansas, with oil wells ""even in the front yard."" Natalie Wood plays Deany Loomis, daughter of the local butcher, his love interest.They are seniors in high school, and a good bit of the story is as conventional as it was in 1961: will they or will they not have sex? Though the story is set in 1928 and forward, there is much to parallel the 1960s.For one thing, Bud's ""flapper"" sister has been brought home from Chicago after she got pregnant and her mother arranged for her to have an abortion. Of course they do not use those terms. They say ""in a family way,"" and ""one of those operations."" But in 1928 as in 1961, it was not so much effort to translate the euphemisms and innuendos. When Bud talks to his father about how loving Deany and not ""going too far"" is driving him crazy, his father recommends he find one of ""the other kind of girls.""This could have been just one of those corny ""coming of age"" stories, except that the original novel from which it was taken (and which I read when I was probably too young; my mother had a book club subscription) was too intensely well-written.So we get the full, honest brunt of the prison in which these two lusty kids find themselves. Deany asks her mother whether it is wrong for a girl to think about a boy ""that way."" Her mother says that no decent girl does. ""Your father never laid a hand on me until after we were married."" Then she just let him do what he wanted so she could have a child. This was of course great comfort to Deany who was already having extraordinarily lustful thoughts about Bud.So even though he'd rather go to ag school and be a farmer, his father insists Bud go off to Yale, where he drinks too much and does almost no academic work at all. He's pining for Deany, which he tries to talk to his father about, but his father, in the Dean's words, is not too good at listening.Of course, Deany is back in Kansas, exchanging letters with Bud and trying to stay at least moderately sane and reasonable. But of course the local crowd won't let her. Well, it is now 1929, so you know what comes next. The stock market crashes, and suddenly the richest man in town is one of the poorest.What does all that do to our star-crossed lovers? I guess you'll have to see the movie, or read the book if you can find it. You may find the movie even more worthwhile if you read the book first.",4,Quite Scandelous When I Was a Teen,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,2466,"['Warren', 'Beatty', 'big', 'break', 'Bud', 'Stamper', 'top', 'jock', 'son', 'richest', 'man', 'small', 'town', '1928', 'Kansas', 'oil', 'wells', 'even', 'front', 'yard', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Deany', 'Loomis', 'daughter', 'local', 'butcher', 'love', 'interest.They', 'are', 'seniors', 'high', 'school', 'good', 'bit', 'story', 'as', 'conventional', 'was', '1961', 'will', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'story', 'set', '1928', 'forward', 'much', 'parallel', '1960s.For', 'one', 'thing', 'Bud', 'flapper', 'sister', 'been', 'brought', 'home', 'Chicago', 'got', 'pregnant', 'mother', 'arranged', 'have', 'abortion', 'course', 'do', 'not', 'use', 'terms', 'say', 'family', 'way', 'one', 'operations', '1928', '1961', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'effort', 'translate', 'euphemisms', 'innuendos', 'When', 'Bud', 'talks', 'father', 'how', 'loving', 'Deany', 'not', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'driving', 'crazy', 'father', 'find', 'one', 'other', 'kind', 'girls', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'one', 'corny', 'coming', 'age', 'stories', 'original', 'novel', 'was', 'taken', 'read', 'when', 'was', 'probably', 'too', 'young', 'mother', 'had', 'book', 'club', 'subscription', 'was', 'too', 'intensely', 'well-written.So', 'get', 'full', 'honest', 'brunt', 'prison', 'two', 'lusty', 'kids', 'find', 'Deany', 'mother', 'wrong', 'girl', 'think', 'boy', 'way', 'mother', 'decent', 'girl', 'father', 'never', 'laid', 'hand', 'were', 'married', 'Then', 'just', 'let', 'do', 'what', 'wanted', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'child', 'was', 'course', 'great', 'comfort', 'Deany', 'who', 'was', 'already', 'having', 'extraordinarily', 'lustful', 'thoughts', 'Bud.So', 'even', ""'d"", 'rather', 'go', 'ag', 'school', 'be', 'farmer', 'father', 'Bud', 'go', 'off', 'Yale', 'where', 'too', 'much', 'almost', 'academic', 'work', 'pining', 'Deany', 'talk', 'father', 'father', 'Dean', 'words', 'not', 'too', 'good', 'listening.Of', 'course', 'Deany', 'back', 'Kansas', 'exchanging', 'letters', 'Bud', 'trying', 'stay', 'least', 'moderately', 'sane', 'reasonable', 'course', 'local', 'crowd', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'Well', 'now', '1929', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'stock', 'market', 'crashes', 'suddenly', 'richest', 'man', 'town', 'one', 'poorest.What', 'do', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'can', 'find', 'may', 'find', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'read', 'book', 'first']",N/A

The impossibly sexy Natalie Wood, who was married to Robert Wagner at the time, plays a supposed virgin who goes nuts over her love for the young Warren Beaty, who would go on to make a career out of driving every woman in Hollywood nuts. Both stars were in their 20s here, but were attempting to play late high school teens. The crux of the whole thing is their repressed desire for sex, which not only sends Natalie to the loony bin for almost 4 years, but sends Warren back to the farm where we find him married to some dumb pizza waitress with a dirty baby crawling on the floor of their farmhouse. Oh, and it's supposed to be 1928-29 when the stock market crashed. The look of the film is interesting on 1080p DVD. Both stars were very pretty in their heyday.

102422,APP5MBH2BSX6I,0790733935,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[2, 4]","The topic of young people reaching adulthood has seemingly been dealt with over the years in as many ways as there are young people reaching adulthood.  In ""Splendor In the Grass,"" however, the passion of the teen years contrasts more eloquently with the wistful practicality of young adulthood than any such story I've seen in quite some time.This is the latest in a series of reviews I've written on older films that I'd not seen before but have been spurred to seek out because of their inclusion in the NY Times list of ""1000 best movies ever.""  It's the film debut of Warren Beatty, who stars opposite Natalie Wood in a role that earned her one of her ""Best Actress"" Oscar nominations.  The film won an Oscar for best screenplay.Beatty (Bud) & Wood (Deannie) are teen lovers in southeastern Kansas in 1928.  Bud is the rich favorite son of the town, heir to an oil fortune, captain of the football team, the All-American boy.  Deannie is daughter in a much less upscale family, and her mama refers to Bud as ""the catch of a lifetime"" while Bud's daddy runs his life and won't hear any alternatives to the life he has chosen for his boy:  Sow your wild oats, get a Yale education, then marry Deannie if you still want to, and take over the family oil business.His boy just wants to be a rancher.Some of the themes covered in ""Splendor In the Grass"" are well-worn by now, but even in a film nearly a half-century old they are mostly presented with a fresh take.  Bud is a deeply honorable boy who feels compelled to follow his father's wishes, but simply cannot bear to be parted from Deannie; however, since his father won't let him marry Deannie before college, Bud feels it's best to stop seeing Deannie for awhile.  The sexual tension up to that point in the film is remarkably palpable for a film of this era, showing again that modern Hollywood rings false when it thinks nudity and promiscuity are the only ways to get this feeling across.The tragedies set in motion by Bud's father, both in his business decisions and in the way he strong-arms his family, permanently alter everyone in the film, with some lovely twists of fate along the way, before the characters reach a satisfactory and bittersweet resolution that leaves the viewer thinking, ""Why, of course.  I can identify with that.""  It's a happy ending, kind of, but one that leaves the future open-ended for a more happy ending down the road.The dynamics of family have often been presented with more insight in the years since films like ""Splendor In the Grass"" helped shape the current consciousness of today's filmgoer, but at the time this was one of the stories that helped young people attain a voice in the modern world that they didn't used to have.  It deserves a place along such other family conflict classics as ""East of Eden"" and ""Cat On a Hot Tin Roof.""",4,Coming of age and the stock market crash,1107907200,"02 9, 2005",2005,2838,"['topic', 'young', 'people', 'reaching', 'adulthood', 'seemingly', 'been', 'dealt', 'years', 'as', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'young', 'people', 'reaching', 'adulthood', 'Splendor', 'Grass', 'however', 'passion', 'teen', 'years', 'more', 'eloquently', 'wistful', 'practicality', 'young', 'adulthood', 'such', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'time.This', 'latest', 'series', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'written', 'older', 'films', ""'d"", 'not', 'seen', 'have', 'been', 'spurred', 'seek', 'out', 'inclusion', 'NY', 'Times', 'list', '1000', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'film', 'debut', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'who', 'opposite', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'role', 'earned', 'one', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'film', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'screenplay.Beatty', 'Bud', 'Wood', 'Deannie', 'are', 'teen', 'lovers', 'southeastern', 'Kansas', '1928', 'Bud', 'rich', 'favorite', 'son', 'town', 'heir', 'oil', 'fortune', 'captain', 'football', 'team', 'All-American', 'boy', 'Deannie', 'daughter', 'much', 'less', 'upscale', 'family', 'mama', 'refers', 'Bud', 'catch', 'lifetime', 'Bud', 'daddy', 'life', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'alternatives', 'life', 'chosen', 'boy', 'Sow', 'wild', 'oats', 'get', 'Yale', 'education', 'then', 'marry', 'Deannie', 'still', 'want', 'take', 'family', 'oil', 'business.His', 'boy', 'just', 'be', 'rancher.Some', 'themes', 'covered', 'Splendor', 'Grass', 'are', 'well-worn', 'now', 'even', 'film', 'nearly', 'half-century', 'old', 'are', 'mostly', 'presented', 'fresh', 'take', 'Bud', 'deeply', 'honorable', 'boy', 'who', 'compelled', 'follow', 'father', 'wishes', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'be', 'parted', 'Deannie', 'however', 'father', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'marry', 'Deannie', 'college', 'Bud', 'best', 'stop', 'seeing', 'Deannie', 'awhile', 'sexual', 'tension', 'up', 'point', 'film', 'remarkably', 'palpable', 'film', 'era', 'showing', 'again', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'rings', 'false', 'when', 'nudity', 'promiscuity', 'are', 'only', 'ways', 'get', 'feeling', 'across.The', 'tragedies', 'set', 'motion', 'Bud', 'father', 'business', 'decisions', 'way', 'family', 'permanently', 'alter', 'everyone', 'film', 'lovely', 'twists', 'fate', 'way', 'characters', 'reach', 'satisfactory', 'bittersweet', 'resolution', 'viewer', 'thinking', 'Why', 'course', 'can', 'identify', 'happy', 'ending', 'kind', 'one', 'future', 'open-ended', 'more', 'happy', 'ending', 'down', 'road.The', 'dynamics', 'family', 'have', 'often', 'been', 'presented', 'more', 'insight', 'years', 'films', 'Splendor', 'Grass', 'helped', 'shape', 'current', 'consciousness', 'today', 'filmgoer', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'stories', 'helped', 'young', 'people', 'attain', 'voice', 'modern', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'used', 'have', 'place', 'such', 'other', 'family', 'conflict', 'classics', 'East', 'Eden', 'Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof']",N/A
102423,A1JCWK43MAGZIG,0790733935,"By Definition ""By Definition""","[5, 5]","I agree with all those who have praised Elia Kazan's genius, William Inge's timeless story, and Warren and Natalie for their poignant portrayals in Splendor in the Grass. The macguffin in the plot is the consummation of Deanie and Bud's relationship, a Romeo and Juliet story of parental manipulation, with a rich and inexhaustible supply of character depth and detail. Kazan's cup runneth over.From Pat Hingle's depiction of an overbearing, oppressive father who smothers his victims with his love and ambition, Audrey Christie as Deanie's manipulative mother, and all the guidance counselors, doctors, coaches, and students along the way, the entire supporting cast is unparalleled. This film is about pain and misunderstanding, but there's no laughter to relieve the tension. And if the sexual revolution of the 1960's had any core opus or opening salvo, SITG is surely one of them.What is surprising is how the parents of the families get along with each other and take pride in their children's pending engagement. This tends to isolate the barriers to happiness as being not so much familial as societal.SITG has a lot to say about family and peer relationships that remains relevant for all time, and it moves so quickly and passionately to tell it's ironic and painful story. SITG has a flow, efficiency, and economy of storytelling that is most unusual and quite literary, especially by today's standards. The story structure and editing are as tight as any film ever made, and nothing ever, ever gets bogged down.If you want to see how much meaning and richness can be communicated in just a few seconds of film, I invite you to examine SITG. The use of surprisingly short scenes lasting only a few seconds which dissolve from one to another is so effective. Once one scene is complete, there is no waiting, no ponderous pause, no wasted motion...the editing moves at the earliest possible moment to the next scene. For example, there is less than a minute of screen time from the final breakup until Bud meets his new lover, Angela.This isn't like editing in commercials where cuts flash by at subliminal speeds. In SITG, dissolves are used to express short elapses...fade out and fade in is used to express longer passages of time. What a fine education and discipline is here for any filmmaker.There are so many great character actors from the period, but an often overlooked one is Kermit Murdock as Dean Pollard (at Yale), who finds himself sandwiched in between the father's desires and those of Bud. As the story moves forward, Bud's father becomes increasingly desperate to maintain control of Bud, but instead loses control of his own life. That confrontation between Ace Stamper and Dean Pollard in the Dean's office very nicely juxtaposes the stock crash with the clash over academic goals. ""What's the matter with people?"" he says, even as his own irrationality is quite apparent.One scene for me that didn't work, however, was Ace Stamper's suicide. More could have been made of it, but Kazan chose to avoid any examination of Bud's feelings towards his father's death, and handled the sequence in an uncharacteristically detached manner.Fred Stewart as Del Loomis the storekeeper strikes an emotional tone of indifference and apathy. But his repeated admonition to ""always drink plenty of milk, Deanie"", is a sly, Freudian way of saying, ""Listen to your mother, she knows what's good for you.""The late Kazan seemed to have an understanding of human nature and an interest in people that far exceeded most of us mere mortals. But if his movie is a meal, perhaps he uses too much MSG at times to enhance the flavor of his story. The long New Year's Eve party sequence, with a cadre of tuxedo-clad bachelors lusting after Ginny Stamper, is one over-the-top scene that could have used too much MSG, but still makes it's point uncompromisingly.

It is, therefore, even more amazing to me how entertaining this movie is for me.  First of all, the chemistry between the beautiful Natalie Wood and the handsome Warren Beatty is off the charts. They are so young, especially her, but they are such masters of their craft even at their young ages.  This movie has the depressing events of the times woven through the lives of the characters such as people jumping from windows after the stock market crashed.First love, young oppressed love is the central theme. ""Good girls"" and ""bad girls"" and ""boys will be boys"" relay the double standard message of the times and of the movie.  I can almost feel the pain of Bud and Deanie who are so much in love, but are not allowed to physically express it. Even though Bud wants Deanie and Deanie wants Bud, she has been raised to believe good girls don't, and he has been raised to believe there are two kinds of girls, and one is for fun and one is for marrying.  While Bud, the school football star, wants to marry Deanie, his domineering father, (played to perfection by Pat Hingle) is living vicariously through him and insists the son fufill the father's dream of college football stardom first.  Bud, who can ignore his teenage hormones no longer, succumbs to the girl passed around by all the boys in school. Losing Bud is more than Deanie can mentally handle, and she is sent to a mental facility.First love is shown to be powerful but not meant to be. Even after Bud marries a girl he impregnates while in college and brings her home to live on the farm, and Deanie falls in love with a boy she meets in the facility, their love is still evident and strong.  Although this is not a happily ever after story, and I wished until the very end that Bud and Deanie would reunite, it was not meant to be.  It is still one of my favorite movies of all time.  Whether or not you are a fan of Natalie Wood and/or Warren Beatty, this movie is worth your time.

Seemingly destined to be together, they are thwarted by repressive sexual mores and their overbearing parents.  Deanie suffers a nervous breakdown over their separation and Bud winds up a failure at Yale, eventually becoming a dirt farmer.  This occurs against a backdrop of 20s financial speculation, culminating in the stock market crash and depression.  Beatty is adequate as Bud, while Natalie Wood gives a deeply sensitive portrayal as Deanie.  However, both principals are upstaged by the actors portraying their dominant parents.  Pat Hingle, always excellent, plays Bud's wealthy father, a crude oil man.  Audrey Christie is Deanie's mother, constantly vigilant about her daughter's purity.  Both manage the difficult task of portraying sincerely loving parents who nevertheless have a baneful influence on their children's lives.  I'd also like to put in a good word for Fred Stewart playing Del Loomis, Deanie's father.  His role as the small town grocer is small, but he does subtle wonders in a scene at the end of the movie where he overrules his wife's objection to Deanie's seeing Bud again.  One wants to weep at his paternal love. If the film's diatribe against sexual repression is no longer fresh, its depiction of the banality of smalltown life remains so.  This is skillfully shown in the second scene, where the Loomises' frame house is shown behind a large graphic reading &quot;Southeast Kansas 1928.&quot;  By vaguely mentioning the story's setting, rather than specifying a town, the director, Kazan, emphasizes the generic quality of the setting and makes it more insignificant and insipid.  Snoopy, gossiping neighbors, drunken oil workers, and insensitive classmates all contribute to this mood.  The one character who attempts to break free from this stifling atmosphere, Bud's wayward sister, Ginny, comes to grief, as if to emphasize the impossibility of escape. Despite the somewhat pedestrian plot, the film is redeemed by the performances.  The final scene, where Deanie, home after being cured of her breakdown, visits Bud, now married and living on a dusty farm, is very poignant.  It's a vivid depiction of lovers separated by destiny. I would also like to praise David Amram's evocative, bluesy theme music.  Played over the opening credits, it mightily prepares the viewer for the story he's about to see. I can't close this review without complaining that I was unable to access the theatrical trailer promised on my DVD box.

In the same year as her Maria in ""West Side Story"", she has never been more affecting then she is here as Deanie Loomis, the local butcher's daughter deeply in love with Bud Stamper, the son of an oil scion and the high school football hero. They are the senior sweethearts everyone expects to marry, but both have to battle constantly with their sexual longing and their grasping parents.The ruling moral code restricts Deanie more than Bud who ends up cavorting with a good-time girl named Juanita. The indiscretion overwhelms Deanie who attempts suicide and ends up in a sanitarium for her fragile mental state. A few years later with their lives on divergent paths, they meet again to come to terms with each other. While the whole film is beautifully executed thanks to Kazan's sure hand and William Inge's screenplay (his first directly for the screen), it's the last fifteen minutes that really resonate with the characters expressing their emotions with a minimum of dialogue. Otherwise, there are plenty of heated moments of melodrama along with soap opera elements familiar to anyone who has seen 1955's ""Picnic"" based on Inge's successful Broadway play.At her most beautiful, Wood is wondrous as she moves fluidly from innocently infatuated to obsessive to resigned. As the none-too-bright Bud, Warren Beatty is charismatic in his film debut and makes Deanie's powerful fixation completely understandable.

Foy,"[1, 6]","Here we have just one of those really good American movies that let the international community know that not all our movies are stupid or withut real plots. Basically, anyone can watch this movie and get something out of it because everyone's been through what these characters go through to SOME degree. It's universal yet distinctly American, and it's a very well-crafted movie. Most of the scenes seem idyllic yet menacing at the same time - the nice, white picket fence houses of Deanie's Kansas at first seem welcoming, but the more you see the things that go on in them, the more acutely you sense the difference between what the characters shown and what they actually feel. The people in this movie put up happy, idyllic fronts to compensate for how messed up their actual personal lives are, and it destroys almsot all of the characters in the movie. There are a lot of scenes in ""Splendor in the Grass"" that you probably wouldn't want to see if they weren't done so perfectly, because they're so hard to watch. However, they ARE done just about perfectly, to the point where you really just enjoy watching how great they are. My mom saw this when it came out in 1961 - she was 14. After I saw it I felt like I had a much better appreciation for what it must have felt like to live in a time period like Deanie's, when sexuality was generally seen as an abomination - we kids today don't live in a society like that, thank God, and so we don't really have any concept of it. Well, you'd be hard pressed to find a better cinematic portrayal of 1920s Kansas social mores than this, so definitely check it out.

It is directed by the great Elia Kazan (A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, EAST OF EDEN, etc.), has a screenplay by William Inge (PICNIC and BUS STOP), a great title taken from a Wordsworth poem and stars Natalie Wood (WEST SIDE STORY) and Warren Beatty (BONNIE AND CLYDE). The plot is straight-forward: Beatty (Bud) and Wood (Deanie) are high school sweethearts in a small Kansas town in 1928. Bud is from a very well-to-do family while Deanie's family is less well off. As Bud's father says early on in the film, he is a lot like Deanie's father except he has ambition. The young sweethearts struggle with their sexual desires. Deanie will do anything for Bud so her feelings are in constant conflict with her moral values as her mother drums into her that nice girls do not ""go all the way.""While the societal values may have changed in the 21st Century, they were certainly those of many Americans way past 1928 up to the sexual revolution of the 1960's. Much of what the film is about, however, is timeless: the conflict between parents and children, parents who are unwilling to let their children chart their own journey in life, the pain of young love, the sorrow of lost opportunities.The film is well put together. The image of the waterfalls is repeated throughout the movie. Beatty and Wood are perfectly cast as young lovers and give great performances. There is a particularly beautiful scene at the end of the film in a poignant reversal of fortune when Bud and Deanie meet again after several years.

Two high school students, Bud (played by Warren Beatty) and Deanie (Natalie Wood)are hopelessly in love. Bud is the son of the richest man in town; Deenie is the daughter of the local butcher. Both of them are saddled with parental expectations that come close to destroying their lives.  Bud's father wants him to have the Ivy League education that he never had despite the fact that Bud wants nothing more than to marry Deanie and be a rancher; Deanie's mother wants her to stay a virgin (a ""good girl"") until marriage no matter what. On a deeper, more universal level, the film is about how we survive when our dreams are shattered.  The title comes from a verse in a poem by William Wordsworth that states, in part, ""though nothing can bring back the hour of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower, we will grieve not but rather find strength in what remains behind"". The film was written as an original screenplay by one of our greatest American playwrights, William Inge.  He makes a cameo appearance in the film as a chaplin.  The stars and supporting cast (particularly Deanie's mother and Bud's father) are excellent.

Anyone who's read anything about Wood knows she had a profoundly controlling mother, and some of this tangled relationship seems to have seeped into Wood's portrait of a young girl with real issues around her mom.  Few of us who have seen the film will ever entirely forget the scene in which she stands up, dripping wet, in the bathtub to defy her mother, and to send the mother the message that she is no longer a little girl but a woman with a grown woman's needs.  In its days this was shocking and some thought Natalie had lost her mind along with the rest of her wardrobe, for nudity was still a very rare thing in the straitlaced Hollywood cinema of the 1950s.  Director Elia Kazan was perhaps the only man who could have elicited such a strong performance out of her.  Kazan himself saw this film as the culmination of a long line of movies he himself had shepherded through to success, a group of films which did much to put the ""adult"" back into movies, everything from BABY DOLL to WILD RIVER.  Indeed, SPLENDOR was his last real success, either on the screen or stage, for the 1960s left him behind in more ways than one, even though he lived another forty years his best days were long behind him (though surprisingly in recent years there has been a burst of acclaim for the garish ARRANGEMENT, the film he thought his most personal but which was his biggest flop.  As for Warren Beatty, with whom Wood was in real life ""involved"" as they say, this film showed him off at his best and might have been written especially for him, by a smitten William Inge, the Broadway playwright who had had four great hits on the stage, but who had never before attempted a screen original.  This too was Inge's last success, but for Beatty it was only the beginning to a fine career.  And for Wordsworth?  SPLENDOR did for the 91th century Romantic poet what FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL did for W.H. Auden--put him, however briefly, on the best seller list, after a scene in which poor Deenie is forced to recite in class a section from Wordsworth's ""Intimations of Immortality,"" and halfway through she realizes that its implications have hit home in a devastating way, and she breaks down, crying, in front of her teacher and fellow students.  It is one of the great moments in screen acting, and should have won Natalie Wood the Oscar that year.Phyllis Diller is also pretty good in the movie, but her part is so strange you wonder why it was even included.",5,And Glory In The Flower,1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,2595,"['Deenie', 'inspired', 'creation', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'one', 'acting', 'skills', 'newfound', 'confidence', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'anything', 'Wood', 'knows', 'had', 'profoundly', 'controlling', 'mother', 'tangled', 'relationship', 'have', 'seeped', 'Wood', 'portrait', 'young', 'girl', 'real', 'issues', 'mom', 'Few', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'will', 'ever', 'entirely', 'forget', 'scene', 'up', 'dripping', 'wet', 'bathtub', 'defy', 'mother', 'send', 'mother', 'message', 'no', 'longer', 'little', 'girl', 'woman', 'grown', 'woman', 'needs', 'days', 'was', 'shocking', 'thought', 'Natalie', 'had', 'lost', 'mind', 'rest', 'wardrobe', 'nudity', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'rare', 'thing', 'straitlaced', 'Hollywood', 'cinema', '1950s', 'Director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'was', 'perhaps', 'only', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'elicited', 'strong', 'performance', 'Kazan', 'saw', 'film', 'culmination', 'long', 'line', 'movies', 'had', 'shepherded', 'success', 'group', 'films', 'did', 'much', 'put', 'adult', 'back', 'movies', 'everything', 'BABY', 'DOLL', 'WILD', 'RIVER', 'Indeed', 'SPLENDOR', 'was', 'last', 'real', 'success', 'either', 'screen', 'stage', '1960s', 'left', 'behind', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'even', 'lived', 'forty', 'years', 'best', 'days', 'were', 'long', 'surprisingly', 'recent', 'years', 'there', 'been', 'burst', 'acclaim', 'garish', 'ARRANGEMENT', 'film', 'thought', 'most', 'personal', 'was', 'biggest', 'flop', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'whom', 'Wood', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'involved', 'say', 'film', 'showed', 'off', 'best', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'especially', 'smitten', 'William', 'Inge', 'Broadway', 'playwright', 'who', 'had', 'had', 'four', 'great', 'hits', 'stage', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'before', 'attempted', 'screen', 'original', 'too', 'was', 'Inge', 'last', 'success', 'Beatty', 'was', 'only', 'beginning', 'fine', 'career', 'Wordsworth', 'SPLENDOR', 'did', '91th', 'century', 'Romantic', 'poet', 'what', 'FOUR', 'WEDDINGS', 'AND', 'A', 'FUNERAL', 'did', 'W.H', 'Auden', 'put', 'however', 'briefly', 'best', 'seller', 'list', 'scene', 'poor', 'Deenie', 'forced', 'recite', 'class', 'section', 'Wordsworth', 'Intimations', 'Immortality', 'halfway', 'implications', 'have', 'hit', 'home', 'devastating', 'way', 'down', 'crying', 'front', 'teacher', 'fellow', 'students', 'one', 'great', 'moments', 'screen', 'acting', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Oscar', 'year.Phyllis', 'Diller', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'part', 'so', 'strange', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'even', 'included']",N/A
102454,A1L43KWWR05PCS,0790733935,Lawyeraau,"[15, 15]","This is a deft directorial effort by Elia Kazan. The name of the film comes from some telling lines of poetry from Wordsworth that are thematic for what transpires in the film. It is a beautifully acted, well told, coming of age story. It is also a story about young love in all its innocence and hopefulness.The film takes the viewer to the bucolic Midwest of the nineteen twenties. There, the viewer meets small town, high school sweethearts, the lovely Wilma Dean Loomis (Natalie Wood) and the handsome and wealthy Bud Stamper (Warren Beatty). Wilma, ""Deanie"" to her friends, is head over heels in love with Bud, and he is head over heels in love with ""Deanie"". They want to get married right after graduation, and Bud wants to farm the family ranch.The only problem is Bud's Father. He wants Bud to cool it with ""Deanie"" and to see other girls for the fun of it. He wants Bud to attend an Ivy League college and put off getting married. Bud tries to comply and cools it with ""Deanie"". The problem is that things had heated up between them before the breakup, and ""Deanie"" cannot adjust to being without Bud. Her heartbreak is palpable, and Natalie Wood's performance is so poignant, the viewer can just about hear her heart break, when she sees Bud with another girl. It is her yearning for what was that ultimately brings her to the bittersweet edge of despair. Likewise, it is Bud's yearning for ""Deanie"" that makes him behave in ways that are contrary to his own interests.Well, the best laid plans often go awry, and things do not work out for Bud or ""Deanie"" the way they had originally planned. Their world is rent asunder by the vicissitudes of life and the impact of world events and others on their plans. What happens to ""Deanie"" and Bud when they come to a fork in the road, puts them on paths that may criss-cross, but will never again see them travel on the same road at the same time. This is a heartrending story of star crossed lovers that is sure to touch the viewer. It is at the conclusion of the film that the beauty of Wordsworth's words are driven home and take root in the viewer's heart.",5,POIGNANT COMING OF AGE STORY OF STAR CROSSED LOVERS...,1024099200,"06 15, 2002",2002,2115,"['deft', 'directorial', 'effort', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'name', 'film', 'telling', 'lines', 'poetry', 'Wordsworth', 'are', 'thematic', 'what', 'film', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'well', 'told', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'also', 'story', 'young', 'love', 'innocence', 'hopefulness.The', 'film', 'viewer', 'bucolic', 'Midwest', 'nineteen', 'twenties', 'viewer', 'meets', 'small', 'town', 'high', 'school', 'sweethearts', 'lovely', 'Wilma', 'Dean', 'Loomis', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'handsome', 'wealthy', 'Bud', 'Stamper', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'Wilma', 'Deanie', 'friends', 'head', 'heels', 'love', 'Bud', 'head', 'heels', 'love', 'Deanie', 'want', 'get', 'married', 'right', 'graduation', 'Bud', 'farm', 'family', 'only', 'problem', 'Bud', 'Father', 'Bud', 'cool', 'Deanie', 'see', 'other', 'girls', 'fun', 'Bud', 'attend', 'Ivy', 'League', 'college', 'put', 'off', 'getting', 'married', 'Bud', 'comply', 'cools', 'Deanie', 'problem', 'things', 'had', 'heated', 'up', 'breakup', 'Deanie', 'can', 'not', 'adjust', 'being', 'Bud', 'heartbreak', 'palpable', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'performance', 'so', 'poignant', 'viewer', 'can', 'just', 'about', 'hear', 'heart', 'break', 'when', 'Bud', 'girl', 'yearning', 'what', 'was', 'ultimately', 'bittersweet', 'edge', 'despair', 'Likewise', 'Bud', 'yearning', 'Deanie', 'behave', 'ways', 'are', 'contrary', 'own', 'interests.Well', 'best', 'laid', 'plans', 'often', 'go', 'awry', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'Bud', 'Deanie', 'way', 'had', 'originally', 'planned', 'world', 'rent', 'asunder', 'vicissitudes', 'life', 'impact', 'world', 'events', 'others', 'plans', 'What', 'Deanie', 'Bud', 'when', 'come', 'fork', 'road', 'paths', 'may', 'criss-cross', 'will', 'never', 'again', 'see', 'travel', 'same', 'road', 'same', 'time', 'heartrending', 'story', 'star', 'crossed', 'lovers', 'sure', 'touch', 'viewer', 'conclusion', 'film', 'beauty', 'Wordsworth', 'words', 'are', 'driven', 'home', 'take', 'root', 'viewer', 'heart']",N/A

The story focuses on two love struck high school seniors who both have abusive, exploitative parents, which has made them desperate to find a sense of belonging together. They seem to be meant for each other, but as we soon discover, they are really not similar people. Deanie, the young lady, is a vulnerable and sensitive soul, a superior being to Bud. Bud is simple, selfish and finally even cruel to Deanie. When they are finally separated, and Deanie gets away from her domineering mother, she starts to realize who she is. She begins to see that there are different answers for her in life than what she thought. This movie is a masterpiece as far as acting, directing and script are concerned.

When Deanie's mom talks to her, she doesn't give her a chance to confide any of her own feelings about Bud. Mom just says, &quot;Don't do this, don't do that, and be good little girl.&quot; Even worse, Bud's dad just talks and talks, totally oblivious to what Bud wants out of life. The parents are what drive these two teens crazy, not their hormones.I must say that I was pleased with the ending though. (Spoiler ahead). I halfway expected for Deanie and Bud to get together at the end of the film somehow, but Elia Kazan didn't wrap it up with a little bow at the end. A point in his favor.

Deanie's parents support their daughter in her romance with the wealthy Bud Stamper (Warren Beatty), seeing in him ""the opportunity of a lifetime"". The sensitive son yearns for Deanie, but his arrogant father (masterfully played by Pat Hingle) cautions his son, ""If anything happens, you have to marry her"". Bud is on the Yale track, his future mapped out by a father who has planned his son's future.While the angst-ridden lovers are the focus of Elia Kazan's 1961 drama, an original screenplay by William Inge, Deanie's slow unraveling is a direct consequence of the moral hypocrisy of the times; the supporting cast sets the tone for two dysfunctional families, one rich, one middle-class. The arrogant rich father and ineffective mother (""I don't think either of my children gets any real nourishment."") turn a blind eye to their son's discontent, distracted by their wild older daughter, Ginny, a constant source of embarrassment, a wanton female who draws men like honey. Ginny tries to warn her brother, ""If you want to listen to dad, go ahead. But one of these days, you'll find out and then God help you."" Later, Ginny meets the inevitable fate of other on-screen bad girls.This is a fascinating period in American history, the market ripe for plundering until it wipes out fortunes in a single afternoon, Bud's family included. There is no compromise in this film, the lines of right and wrong sharply drawn. Deanie is struggling with an emerging sexuality that is both condemned and monitored by a rigid mother who browbeats her daughter into submission. Clinging to her family values, Deanie's constant restraint (""Bud, don't!"") eventually drives Bud away, leaving her ravaged and confused. Unable to bear the consequences of life without Bud, Deanie has nervous breakdown. Harassed by his driven father, Bud has his own demons, natural impulses that drive him into the arms of Wanda, the bad girl from the other side of the tracks.  Bud hardly fares better than Deanie, his family fortune lost and a future without Deanie bleak.An abundance of money renders the rich extravagant and impulsive, greedily watched by those who struggle with small lives suddenly offered the promise of instant wealth through stock investments. A new century soon tainted by its own excesses, an industrialized society is in flux, the younger generation already questioning their parents' values, but with no tolerance for failure. The lovers are doomed in a class-driven world, their unmatched backgrounds unsuitable, each forced into a future defined by compromise and a loss of ideals. This movie marks the beginning of Natalie Wood's enduring love affair with the American public, soon after the popular Rebel with a Cause. The emotionally vulnerable Deanie is one of many roles, a girl's fragile innocence destroyed by a heartless world with no room for dreamers.

Elia Kazan's masterpiece of adolescent longing, self-discovery and suppression is a fabulous experience. The hypocritical society that stifles young Deanie Loomis (Wood), drilling that no nice girl indulges or thinks about natural sexual desires and impulses, while young men are free to pursue their lust, but not with any virtuous girls. Deanie, daughter of a working-class family, is madly in love with Bud Stamper (Beatty, in his debut), the son of the wealthiest clan in town, and star of the school's athletic teams. Their romance is doomed by their parents' interference and control. Bud can't continue the relationship with all the pressure placed on him by his domineering father, Ace (Pat Hingle), not to mention the presence of his nymphomaniac, flapper sister, Ginny (Barbara Loden, who, at this time, was Mrs. Elia Kazan). Deanie's mother (Audrey Christie) constantly shadows her daughter, discouraging her from any impure thoughts or actions. After their breakup, Bud gets his release from the most promiscuous girl in school, and this devastates Deanie, who feels that she has to go bad to regain his love and attention. At a school dance, she copies Ginny's seductive style, and attempts to seduce Bud to get him back. He turns her down, leading Deanie to the reservoir where her nervous breakdown explodes, and she is sent to a sanitarium to recuperate. Bud then has to find himself, while Deanie must heal to regain her sanity and sense of self-worth.Each of their journeys are poignant, as is the revelation that Ginny, on a self-destructive path, dies in an automobile crash. She obviously desperately wanted her father's unconditional love and attention, which he refused to give her, never ceasing to remind her that she was an embarrassment and a disappointment. Her drunken argument with Bud says it all - ""If you weren't my brother, you wouldn't even come near me! You're a nice boy, you're nice, I know what you nice boys are like - you only talk to me in the dark!"" Bud's meeting with his future wife, Angelina (Zohra Lampert) and Deanie's relationship with fellow patient Johnny, beautifully presents the inner peace and healing that each of the protagonists have sought. The climax is a wonderfully touching end - a reunion of sorts, to make peace with the past.""Though nothing can bring back the hour of splendor in the grass, glory in the flower, we will grieve not, rather find strength in what remains behind."" Wood was Oscar-nominated for Best Actress, and she certainly was deserving of that accolade. She and Beatty began an affair after shooting was completed that was sadly short-lived, kind of a painful echo of their on-screen relationship. Another sad parallel is Deanie's breakdown as she swims in the reservoir, since Wood's tragic demise would be as a result of the element that she feared most - water.The film also features the debuts of Gary Lockwood, Sandy Dennis and Phyllis Diller, as well as Splendor's playwright author, William Inge, in a cameo as the church reverend.A beautiful piece of movie-making, deserving of its status as a classic.",5,"Splendor In The Grass, Glory In The Flower, Nothing Can Bring Back The Hour",1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,3351,"['Opening', 'glorious', 'shot', 'waterfall', 'passionate', 'lip-lock', 'raven-haired', 'beauty', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'boyishly', 'handsome', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'old-fashioned', 'car', 'ambivalent', 'need', 'succumb', 'temptation', 'wanting', 'be', 'good', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Bud', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'masterpiece', 'adolescent', 'longing', 'self-discovery', 'suppression', 'fabulous', 'experience', 'hypocritical', 'society', 'young', 'Deanie', 'Loomis', 'Wood', 'drilling', 'nice', 'girl', 'indulges', 'thinks', 'natural', 'sexual', 'desires', 'impulses', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'free', 'pursue', 'lust', 'not', 'virtuous', 'girls', 'Deanie', 'daughter', 'working-class', 'family', 'madly', 'love', 'Bud', 'Stamper', 'Beatty', 'debut', 'son', 'wealthiest', 'clan', 'town', 'star', 'school', 'athletic', 'teams', 'romance', 'doomed', 'parents', 'interference', 'control', 'Bud', 'ca', ""n't"", 'continue', 'relationship', 'pressure', 'placed', 'domineering', 'father', 'Ace', 'Pat', 'Hingle', 'not', 'mention', 'presence', 'nymphomaniac', 'flapper', 'sister', 'Ginny', 'Barbara', 'Loden', 'who', 'time', 'was', 'Mrs.', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'Deanie', 'mother', 'Audrey', 'Christie', 'constantly', 'daughter', 'discouraging', 'impure', 'thoughts', 'actions', 'breakup', 'Bud', 'release', 'most', 'promiscuous', 'girl', 'school', 'Deanie', 'who', 'go', 'bad', 'regain', 'love', 'attention', 'school', 'dance', 'Ginny', 'seductive', 'style', 'attempts', 'seduce', 'Bud', 'get', 'back', 'down', 'leading', 'Deanie', 'reservoir', 'where', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'explodes', 'sent', 'sanitarium', 'recuperate', 'Bud', 'then', 'find', 'Deanie', 'must', 'heal', 'regain', 'sanity', 'sense', 'self-worth.Each', 'journeys', 'are', 'poignant', 'revelation', 'Ginny', 'self-destructive', 'path', 'automobile', 'crash', 'obviously', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'father', 'unconditional', 'love', 'attention', 'refused', 'give', 'never', 'ceasing', 'remind', 'was', 'embarrassment', 'disappointment', 'drunken', 'argument', 'Bud', 'were', ""n't"", 'brother', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', ""'re"", 'nice', 'boy', ""'re"", 'nice', 'know', 'what', 'nice', 'boys', 'are', 'only', 'talk', 'dark', 'Bud', 'meeting', 'future', 'wife', 'Angelina', 'Zohra', 'Lampert', 'Deanie', 'relationship', 'fellow', 'patient', 'Johnny', 'beautifully', 'inner', 'peace', 'healing', 'protagonists', 'have', 'sought', 'climax', 'wonderfully', 'touching', 'end', 'reunion', 'sorts', 'make', 'peace', 'past', 'nothing', 'can', 'bring', 'back', 'hour', 'splendor', 'grass', 'glory', 'flower', 'will', 'grieve', 'not', 'rather', 'find', 'strength', 'what', 'behind', 'Wood', 'was', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'certainly', 'was', 'deserving', 'accolade', 'Beatty', 'began', 'affair', 'shooting', 'was', 'completed', 'was', 'sadly', 'short-lived', 'kind', 'painful', 'echo', 'on-screen', 'relationship', 'sad', 'parallel', 'Deanie', 'breakdown', 'reservoir', 'Wood', 'tragic', 'demise', 'would', 'be', 'result', 'element', 'feared', 'most', 'water.The', 'film', 'also', 'debuts', 'Gary', 'Lockwood', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'Phyllis', 'Diller', 'as', 'well', 'Splendor', 'playwright', 'author', 'William', 'Inge', 'cameo', 'church', 'reverend.A', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'movie-making', 'deserving', 'status', 'classic']",N/A

WordsworthThis is a Freudian film of repressed sexuality and its consequences, that takes place in 1925 in Kansas. The two stars Warren Beatty and Natalie Wood are high school seniors who can't consummate their love due to social constraints of their time. As far fetched as it may seem within today's mores, this was the case in the 1920's. This was Warren Beatty's first film, and it was a great showcase to his future film career. Natalie Wood shines in this film, and as I watched this film I wondered what kind of mental illness occurred in her family.  Wood's character had a real shrew as a mother, and Beatty's father was an overbearing, unloving man.The director was Elian Kazan, one of those directors who was not afraid to break down the barriers of sexual,frustration.

""Rebel Without a Cause"", of course, was the most important movie for a slightly earlier generation, those teenagers growing up in the mid-1950's ultra-conservative Eisenhower era. Judging from the above, one could reasonably argue that Natalie Wood was our most influential actress, especially since she starred in all three films. (Frankly, Natalie never again had the opportunity or the parts to top what she had already achieved, despite such hits as ""Gypsy"" or the dated ""Bob and Ted and Carol and Alice,"" but then, what other actress, no matter how talented, can you name who even came close to being a part of such milestone films?)It's also true that teenagers of the early 1960s were as sexually repressed as the teenagers depicted in this movie, set in the late 1920s and early 1930s. There were the ""good"" girls who managed to stay virginal, the ""bad"" girls who didn't, and a third group, the girls who were clever or lucky enough to have it both ways -- keeping their reputations, if nothing else, intact.Thus, the story of Deanie's frustrated love for Bud, hampered by the family and societal pressures that keep both of them from ""going all the way,"" make this ""Romeo and Juliet"" tale one that spoke to an entire generation.  Though nearly half a century has passed since this film's release, it still continues to be emotionally moving for teenagers and adults of today.Based on a one-act play by William Inge, ""Glory in the Flower,"" the author's expansion to a full-length screen version opened up the story and improved vastly upon the original source. By setting it in the Midwest pre-Depression era, Inge assured that even if sexual morality among teenagers became more lax, as it certainly did with the passing of years, the repressions depicted within the movie's timeframe are still valid. (William Inge even has an uncredited cameo role as a minister, Reverend Whitman.) Also valid are the movie's two other major premises -- first, parents, with the best intentions, still manage to screw up their children's lives (just as their parents did to them), and second, people are ultimately resilient, learn to pick up the pieces of their damaged lives, hopefully learn from their mistakes, and carry on.  Thus, ""Splendor in the Grass,"" meticulously directed by Elia Kazan, beautifully acted by Natalie Wood, Warren Beatty, with a superlative supporting cast, including the one-of-a-kind Zohra Lampert, Audrey Christie, Pat Hingle, Barbara Loden, Fred Stewart, Sandy Dennis, and Crystal Field, can never truly be dated.",5,Still emotionally powerful today,1107043200,"01 30, 2005",2005,2727,"['Splendor', 'Grass', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'released', '1961', 'were', 'most', 'influential', 'well-loved', 'movies', 'generation', 'first', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'baby', 'boomers', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'course', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'movie', 'slightly', 'earlier', 'generation', 'teenagers', 'growing', 'up', 'mid-1950', 'ultra-conservative', 'Eisenhower', 'era', 'Judging', 'above', 'one', 'could', 'reasonably', 'argue', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'was', 'most', 'influential', 'actress', 'especially', 'starred', 'three', 'films', 'Frankly', 'Natalie', 'never', 'again', 'had', 'opportunity', 'parts', 'top', 'what', 'had', 'already', 'achieved', 'such', 'hits', 'Gypsy', 'dated', 'Bob', 'Ted', 'Carol', 'Alice', 'then', 'what', 'other', 'actress', 'matter', 'how', 'talented', 'can', 'name', 'who', 'even', 'came', 'close', 'being', 'part', 'such', 'milestone', 'films', 'also', 'true', 'teenagers', 'early', '1960s', 'were', 'sexually', 'repressed', 'teenagers', 'depicted', 'movie', 'set', 'late', '1920s', 'early', '1930s', 'were', 'good', 'girls', 'who', 'managed', 'stay', 'virginal', 'bad', 'girls', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'third', 'group', 'girls', 'who', 'were', 'clever', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'ways', 'keeping', 'reputations', 'nothing', 'else', 'intact.Thus', 'story', 'Deanie', 'frustrated', 'love', 'Bud', 'hampered', 'family', 'societal', 'pressures', 'keep', 'going', 'way', 'make', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'tale', 'one', 'spoke', 'entire', 'generation', 'nearly', 'century', 'passed', 'film', 'release', 'still', 'be', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'today.Based', 'one-act', 'play', 'William', 'Inge', 'Glory', 'Flower', 'author', 'expansion', 'full-length', 'screen', 'version', 'opened', 'up', 'story', 'improved', 'vastly', 'original', 'source', 'setting', 'Midwest', 'pre-Depression', 'era', 'Inge', 'assured', 'even', 'sexual', 'morality', 'teenagers', 'became', 'more', 'lax', 'certainly', 'did', 'passing', 'years', 'repressions', 'depicted', 'movie', 'timeframe', 'are', 'still', 'valid', 'William', 'Inge', 'even', 'uncredited', 'cameo', 'role', 'minister', 'Reverend', 'Whitman', 'Also', 'valid', 'are', 'movie', 'two', 'other', 'major', 'premises', 'first', 'parents', 'best', 'intentions', 'still', 'manage', 'screw', 'up', 'children', 'lives', 'just', 'parents', 'did', 'second', 'people', 'are', 'ultimately', 'resilient', 'learn', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'damaged', 'lives', 'hopefully', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'carry', 'Thus', 'Splendor', 'Grass', 'meticulously', 'directed', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'superlative', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'one-of-a-kind', 'Zohra', 'Lampert', 'Audrey', 'Christie', 'Pat', 'Hingle', 'Barbara', 'Loden', 'Fred', 'Stewart', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'Crystal', 'Field', 'can', 'never', 'truly', 'be', 'dated']",N/A
102473,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,0790733935,Robert Morris,"[10, 16]","The quotation from Wordsworth's poem from which William Inge derived the title of his screenplay (for which he received an Academy Award) offers an insight into the tendency of young people to ignore or minimize the importance of certain decisions they make which can have significant long-term impact on their adult lives. This is essentially a sad movie in several respects as Wilma Dean Loomis (Natalie Wood) and Bud Stamper (Warren Beatty) struggle without much success to establish a stable relationship while in high school. Both are goaded (driven?) by parents who set ambitious goals for them which frustrate and confuse them. By nature, most adolescents live day-to-day, measuring their happiness in terms of immediate and sustainable social acceptance. For them, tomorrow will somehow take care of itself. Bud seems to live an unexamined life whereas, early on, Wilma seems emotionally vulnerable to self-doubt. Bud is content to get along by going along whereas Wilma becomes increasingly more dependent on carefree Bud. As directed by Elia Kazan, most of the main characters in this film are (to varying degrees) dysfunctional. As a result, communication between and among them is seldom successful. This is especially true of the relationship between Bud and his father (Pat Hingle), perhaps most evident while Bud struggles with his life at Yale.While seeing Splendor in the Grass again recently, I was much less sympathetic with Wilma and Bud than when I first saw it decades ago. Oh sure, that is partly explained by my current age and all of my life experiences as a father and (now) a grandfather. But I also now think that the film (because of Inge's script and Kazan's use of it) too often substitutes melodrama for drama. There is almost no personal development by Bud throughout the film. Wilma recognizes that after seeing him for probably the last time. In contrast, she seems to have learned a number of important life lessons (albeit at a substantial cost) and now possesses -- as the film ends -- a worldly wisdom which Bud will never obtain. This is a brilliantly crafted soap opera. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, it was immensely popular because the emotional world it explores was then so accessible and because that world was presented so simplistically.

A great deal of the acting is wooden, with many examples- Natalie Wood's father, her teacher, the minister (particularly), and several others. Pat Hingle is not wooden though- he overacts so badly that you begin to hate seeing his character. Unfortunately, nobody has anything really worth saying.The only bright spot is Barbara Loden, who plays Warren Beatty's wanton sister.  She really shines in her role.The music is strange too.

It is essentially a twist on the basic Cinderella theme with Beatty coming from what is apparently the richest family in town and Wood coming from a very ordinary family.  This sort of thing rarely happens in real life but is possible with Wood's beauty.The movie has some incongruous parts which make it more interesting.  The first is the difference between Beatty and his father.  The father is a very aggressive and talkative self-made man while Beatty is the opposite except for high school sports where he excels.  Beatty is constantly dominated by his father who manages to break up the pair by sending Beatty to Yale once they graduate.Instead of moving on and finding another boyfriend as would happen in real life Wood becomes extremely agitated and has to be institutionalized in a sanitarium.  This brings on another incongruous part as the pretty and vivacious Wood looks completely out of place in an institution filled with people who are really mentally ill.  Then it just so happens that she meets a new boyfriend at the sanitarium who is also young and lively and eventually they get married.Meanwhile Beatty is extremely depressed at Yale and finds a poor Italian girl at a pizza joint and eventually marries her, thereby continuing the Cinderella theme.  During this time another incongruous part occurs concerning family finances.  Beatty's domineering father owns a large ranch which would be a relatively stable source of income.  This ranch also has oil wells which would make it even more lucrative.  However to incorporate the Great Depression into the movie his father eventually commits suicide by jumping out of a window because of stock losses even though he has his farm to fall back on.It's Natalie Wood that makes this movie worth seeing because her alluring beauty and sparkling personality are basically timeless.",4,IT'S ALL NATALIE WOOD,1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,1979,"['movie', 'set', 'rural', 'Kansas', 'Roaring', 'Twenties', 'starring', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'high', 'school', 'sweethearts', 'essentially', 'twist', 'basic', 'Cinderella', 'theme', 'Beatty', 'coming', 'what', 'apparently', 'richest', 'family', 'town', 'Wood', 'coming', 'very', 'ordinary', 'family', 'sort', 'thing', 'rarely', 'real', 'life', 'possible', 'Wood', 'beauty.The', 'movie', 'incongruous', 'parts', 'make', 'more', 'interesting', 'first', 'difference', 'Beatty', 'father', 'father', 'very', 'aggressive', 'talkative', 'self-made', 'man', 'Beatty', 'opposite', 'high', 'school', 'sports', 'where', 'Beatty', 'constantly', 'dominated', 'father', 'who', 'break', 'up', 'pair', 'sending', 'Beatty', 'Yale', 'once', 'graduate.Instead', 'moving', 'finding', 'boyfriend', 'as', 'would', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'Wood', 'extremely', 'agitated', 'be', 'institutionalized', 'sanitarium', 'incongruous', 'part', 'pretty', 'vivacious', 'Wood', 'completely', 'place', 'institution', 'filled', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'mentally', 'ill.', 'Then', 'just', 'so', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'sanitarium', 'who', 'also', 'young', 'lively', 'eventually', 'get', 'married.Meanwhile', 'Beatty', 'extremely', 'depressed', 'Yale', 'poor', 'Italian', 'girl', 'pizza', 'joint', 'eventually', 'thereby', 'continuing', 'Cinderella', 'theme', 'time', 'incongruous', 'part', 'concerning', 'family', 'finances', 'Beatty', 'domineering', 'father', 'large', 'ranch', 'would', 'be', 'relatively', 'stable', 'source', 'income', 'ranch', 'also', 'oil', 'wells', 'would', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'lucrative', 'However', 'incorporate', 'Great', 'Depression', 'movie', 'father', 'eventually', 'suicide', 'jumping', 'window', 'stock', 'losses', 'even', 'farm', 'fall', 'back', 'on.It', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'movie', 'seeing', 'alluring', 'beauty', 'sparkling', 'personality', 'are', 'basically', 'timeless']",N/A

Deenie(Natalie Wood) and Bud Stampler(Warren Beatty in his debut) are a couple about to finish high school; She wants nothing more than to be with Bud and vice versa. But at the same time, the mores of the day at the time truly confuse them. For one, it is the Roaring 20s but Deenie's mother(Audrey Christie)is of the thought that sex is for reproduction only and a woman has NO sexual desires or longings. Bud on the other hand, wants to please his father(Pat Hingle), the richest man in town, who is so disappointed with his daughter who just want to drink and sleep with other men. Already she has had an abortion and an annullment and she's not happy either so she drinks and sleeps her way out of her troubles and Bud is obligated to fullfill the family's hopes on him by going to Yale and then getting married to Deenie, as his father wants. But all Bud wants to go to the State University there, marry Deenie and ranch on his father's land. When he goes to his father to get an inkling on what he feels, he advises to save Deenie for marriage and get with a fast girl for his sexual pleasure. When he tries to speak to the family doctor after having an illness about his feelings, the doctor gets uncomfortable and isn't any help. So as a son can do, he goes to the fast girl to sow his wild oats and breaks up with Deenie. Deenie, knowing the deal, has a mental breakdown when she decides to give of herself to Bud and he turns her down. She ends up in an institution. Bud ends up in Yale for a minute and flunks. The father tries to intervene but the stock market overrides him and Bud goes home to ranch like he wanted to; Deenie gets better, and goes home to see Bud once again. Since they have both grown apart and have new lives, they make peace and move on.Splendor in the Grass is interesting because you have these two young people who are caught between what they want, and what society feels is best and it causes them both a lot of pain.

102485,ACM90BRKX73OG,0790733935,Tom,"[1, 1]","Splendor in the Grass (Warner Bros., 1961) was director Elia Kazan's fifteenth film.Deanie Loomis (Natalie Wood) and Bud Stamper (Warren Beatty) are the campus queen and king at their small-town Kansas high school in 1928. Deanie is a beautiful girl and Bud is the school's star athlete. But the couple's relationship becomes increasingly strained as Deanie continuously rebuffs Bud's sexual advances. Deanie's mother (Audrey Christie) drills into her daughter the importance of being a ""good"" girl. Bud's father, Ace Stamper (Pat Hingle), is the wealthiest man in town and dreams of his son attending Yale and climbing the corporate ladder while Bud's sister, Ginny (Barbara Loden), rebels against her controlling father by becoming the town tramp.When Bud dates the school floozy to let off some steam Deanie is crushed and suffers a breakdown. She soon seeks out Bud at a school dance, willing to do ""anything"" to keep him, but he refuses her uncharacteristic advances. Distraught, Deanie unsuccessfully attempts suicide and is committed to a mental institution for a couple of years.Ace visits Yale in an attempt to motivate Bud who is failing every subject but when his fortune evaporates with the stock market crash of 1929, Ace jumps to his death from a New York City window. Bud drops out of college and returns to Kansas and his family's ranch with his new wife, an Italian waitress who took a shine to him.When Deanie is released from the sanitarium she returns home and seeks out Bud at his ranch to see if there is any spark left between them although she is engaged to a young man she met while institutionalized. She is surprised to find that Bud is married with an infant and his wife is expecting another. Deanie regrets that her relationship with Bud is over but is determined to carry on.William Inge wrote Splendor's Oscar-winning screenplay with Kazan's input. Inge and Kazan gave puritan, Midwestern morality and repressed sexuality a shot right between the eyes with both barrels. Of course, Inge was no stranger to repressed sexuality. Twenty-three-year-old Natalie Wood's doe-eyed beauty is breathtaking and her performance earned an Oscar nomination, resuscitating her faltering career. Wood's on-set, off-set romance with costar, Warren Betty, drove a stake in the heart of her first marriage with Robert Wagner. Splendor was Beatty's screen debut and it was clear the twenty-four-year-old, cocksure Lothario was destined for stardom. Pat Hingle is simply superb as Ace Stamper. The bigger than life character nearly dominates the film (the Kazan Collection booklet calls the performance a ""tour de force""). Kazan's then-mistress, Barbara Loden, drips sexuality. Even Inge has a cameo as a minister. The entire cast is wonderful.Kazan no doubt was drawn to this crowd-pleasing soap opera after the financial failures of his three previous movies: Baby Doll, A Face in the Crowd, and Wild River. Splendor was the fifth highest grossing film of 1961 and would be the director's last profitable movie. Kazan stated that Splendor was a simple story and certainly not one of his best films but he loved the last reel when Deanie visits Bud on his ranch. It's a bittersweet reunion and Kazan stated that Bud probably felt a bit relieved to no longer be in a relationship with the psychologically troubled Deanie. I would add that while Deanie surely still loved Bud, she must have felt some consolation knowing she would be settling down with her doctor fianc&eacute; rather than with Bud on his broken down, flea bag ranch. In fact, Inge makes it clear in the theatrical adaption of Splendor that Deanie's feelings for Bud did undergo a change as a result of their final meeting. I saw Splendor in the Grass as a young teen and the un-Hollywood, ambivalence-filled ending made quite an impression, sparking my lifelong interest in Elia Kazan. Splendor is a lovely, melancholy film; an ode to the glory and impossibilities of first love.Unfortunately, this DVD comes without a commentary.

102488,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,0790733935,Wanda B. Red,"[5, 7]","An ambitious and superbly acted film, _Splendor in the Grass_ showcases the young Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty in his first screen role. Supporting actors also hold up their end with distinction. The film explores large and universal themes -- the thwarting of young love by parents who fail to understand the depth of their children's passions, the fragility of sanity and even of life itself in the face of the first great disappointments, the tendency for mistakes to repeat themselves over generations and for parents to project their own experiences onto their children. In the end, it is indeed a moving exploration of these and other similar themes.It also must be said, though, that the film doesn't really transcend its specific historical moment the way that truly great works of art sometimes can. It has a polemic specific to its time and place (1961 America), namely that sexual repression is a really bad thing and that it leads to some mighty peculiar and self-destructive behavior.Warren Beatty does an impressive job of portraying a young man impatient for his first sexual experience and frustrated by love, but all that doesn't seem really to be the point. Skulking behind the scenes is the message that this high school in Kansas ought to have instituted a sex-ed class (or at least that the timid Dr. Smiley ought to have done a better job of advising young Bud that his feelings are normal!).Truly, we are not on the Great Plains of Kansas in 1929, but in Hollywood of the nascent 60s. Even an inattentive viewer can just feel the sexual revolution lurking around the corner of this film. Salvation lies in the Freudian ministrations of the sanitarium where the tender Deanie learns to understand herself and her family.In short, though set in the late 1920s, the movie is a period piece about the late 50's, early 60s. At some points, in fact, it is so campily dated that one wants to laugh out loud. Such urges (even when unhealthily repressed) do detract somewhat from the experience of watching this movie in 2006.",4,"Impressive, but not a Film for All Seasons",1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,2042,"['ambitious', 'superbly', 'acted', 'film', '_Splendor', 'Grass_', 'young', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'first', 'screen', 'role', 'Supporting', 'actors', 'also', 'hold', 'up', 'end', 'distinction', 'film', 'large', 'universal', 'themes', 'thwarting', 'young', 'love', 'parents', 'who', 'fail', 'understand', 'depth', 'children', 'passions', 'fragility', 'sanity', 'even', 'life', 'face', 'first', 'great', 'disappointments', 'tendency', 'mistakes', 'repeat', 'generations', 'parents', 'project', 'own', 'experiences', 'children', 'end', 'indeed', 'moving', 'exploration', 'other', 'similar', 'themes.It', 'also', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'though', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'transcend', 'specific', 'historical', 'moment', 'way', 'truly', 'great', 'works', 'art', 'sometimes', 'can', 'polemic', 'specific', 'time', 'place', '1961', 'America', 'namely', 'sexual', 'repression', 'really', 'bad', 'thing', 'mighty', 'peculiar', 'self-destructive', 'behavior.Warren', 'Beatty', 'impressive', 'job', 'portraying', 'young', 'man', 'impatient', 'first', 'sexual', 'experience', 'frustrated', 'love', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'be', 'point', 'Skulking', 'scenes', 'message', 'high', 'school', 'Kansas', 'ought', 'have', 'instituted', 'sex-ed', 'class', 'least', 'timid', 'Dr.', 'Smiley', 'ought', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'advising', 'young', 'Bud', 'feelings', 'are', 'normal', '.Truly', 'are', 'not', 'Great', 'Plains', 'Kansas', '1929', 'Hollywood', 'nascent', '60s', 'Even', 'inattentive', 'viewer', 'can', 'just', 'feel', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'lurking', 'corner', 'film', 'Salvation', 'Freudian', 'ministrations', 'sanitarium', 'where', 'tender', 'Deanie', 'understand', 'family.In', 'short', 'though', 'set', 'late', '1920s', 'movie', 'period', 'piece', 'late', '50', 'early', '60s', 'points', 'fact', 'so', 'campily', 'dated', 'one', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'Such', 'urges', 'even', 'when', 'unhealthily', 'repressed', 'do', 'detract', 'somewhat', 'experience', 'watching', 'movie', '2006']",N/A

This film was made in the 1960s and reeks of the 60s. Secondly, the story is paper thin: girl and boy, in love at school, cannot sexually consummate the relationship because of family and social mores; girl goes off her head and boy marries someone else. It is neither splendid nor green -- but worn and arid. The story meanders through its telling; a key character -- Bud's sister -- brings it to life briefly, then she suddenly disappears out of the plot, as aimlessly as she entered.
