It also shows, but kind of over-simplifies (I hope) how the white,squeaky clean groups covered a lot of the material and made out with big bucks. I will always remember one of the early scenes where Michael Wright's character Eddie, the lead singer of the Heartbeats, barely escapes a violent card game and comes running and sliding on stage to join the Heartbeats in an on-stage competition. But there could have been a lot more music and a little less sub-plot ---sex, racist Southern cops, etc. And the final scene----why on earth couldn't the movie show the members actually singing once again when they got together?

As the group finds success, the original members are driven apart through animosities and controversies that are magnified by fame. The greed and racism of the music industry are correctly portrayed.The music is outstanding, though the lip-synching of the songs is oftentimes much too obvious.The quest for fame, with all its trappings - oftentimes caused by those ""pledged"" to oversee the best interests of a group - are depicted in a timeless manner.

""A New Yorker""","[1, 2]","I've seen this wonderful movie several times and can honestly say this; The movie itself is dramatic, funny, moving, exciting, and intriguing. Needless to say that the sets are great and music is fantastic. I especially applaud the entire cast on such memorable acting performances. The movie was written by Keenen Ivory Wayans and directed Robert Townsend whom both emits a universal message through this film. Message being;  No matter what happens in life, ups and downs, good or bad, gains or losses-we must lift ourselves through it and keep on pushing for the better ,no matter what. Just like in the song feature-""No matter how hard it gets, we haven't finished yet"". I can say without a doubt that this movie took me through just about every basic human emotion possible in its 120 minute cycle. That in itself makes the movie compelling and realistic.Robert Townsend used his comedic skill to really spice up lots of other fun scenes in the movie. Almost everyone who I know who saw the movie liked it, and I personally think it has become a classic work in its own right. Sadly this film was certainly overlooked.  Micheal Wright also put out a great performance, as the mercurial Eddie King Jr., the original lead singer of ""The Five Heartbeats.""""The Five Heartbeats"" is a great ride for people of practically all ages (R rating withstanding of course), as well as all races, genders, and backgrounds. Although the movie is based on an Old-School singing group/hats off to the excellent production of the songs in the movie too.

So I'll tell you about it.First, the good:- Comes with the official movie soundtrack.  I mean the FULL soundtrack, it's a separate disc.- Video transfer is done a lot better than the original DVD release.- Case is designed a lot more appealing than the standard black and blue.- Audio is better encoded and easier to hear at lower volumes.- Lots of extras, including some fluff, but hey.- Better aspect ratio, as the picture fills widescreen displays more evenly without stretching.Now, the bad:- The soundtrack...it's so irritating to listen to, because they managed to do the true movie version of ""Nothing But Love"" and some other songs, fresh from the movie, but yet ""Nights Like This"" is that After 7 version.  I don't mind the After 7 version, it's not bad, but I wanted to hear the movie version.  This is especially troublesome when they even managed to do that Byrd song fresh from the movie.- Some of the footage that never made it in the movie SHOULD have.  Like the scene where Duck is explaining that all of the members can sing all different levels.  It would explain a later scene when Choirboy offers to sing in Eddie's place - when I watched the first version I was confused.  A soprano singing a baritone's parts?  Also, there were some slight comedy pieces in there that should have been included.- Some of the extras are just flat out pointless - or if they wanted to include them at least include the characters people cared about.  There's one extra where the actors in kayfabe are giving their thoughts before accepting 'awards'.  Totally corny, but it might have been entertaining if Eddie Kang Jr. and JT were there.  There's only 3 of the five present.- General movie negative...they never did explain what happened to Bobby, from the beginning of the movie.

492696,AMG2LF8MLUDN1,B000005QLP,M. Fields,"[6, 7]","This is a wonderful look at the soul music business back in the day.  I'm sure that many of the old groups can relate to the struggle of a young group just starting out in the business.  All in all, this is a very good effort by Robert Townsend.  The script and story have their respective weaknesses but can be readily forgiven.  The music in the film has the ""old"" sound of the 50's and 60's but it was written for the film.The Five Heartbeats were made up of actors which I am grateful for since all singers don't make good actors.  The weakest actor is Townsend himself because he is basically a funnyman but he has done some credible work (A Soldiers Story for instance).  While the music was great to listen to, the lip syncing left a little to be desired.  The costuming is dead on.  Except for the murder of the group's manager in the film, it would seem that the circumstances that the group had to endure were fairly authentic.  The crummy hotels, traveling the chitlin circut, racial predjudice, sex, the fights and breakups, unscrupulous record companies, rivalry with the other struggling groups, etc., are all things that artists go through even today.Dianne Caroll is a pleasant sight to see as the managers wife.  At first she resists her husbands desire to manage The Five Heartbeats because every time one of his groups made it to the big time they would drop him as their manager.

Friendships -- good friendships -- are priceless.This is a movie that was out and out ignored by Hollwyood.Easily Robert Townsend's best film and deserving of Academy Award consideration.Awesome acting, brilliant writing and a blazingly inspiring soundtrack.This movie is the complete package.Perhaps the most recommended movie pitch I'll ever make on Amazon for one film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Guaranteed crowd-pleasing movie and one you can watch over and over and over, and not get tired of.",5,Probably one of the best movies I've ever seen,1142726400,"03 19, 2006",2006,2305,"['people', 'run', 'first', 'sight', 'stormy', 'weather', 'SOME', 'people', 'hold', 'work', 'out', 'together', 'lyric', 'movie', 'soundtrack.This', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'everything.It', 'got', 'comedy', 'sorts', 'yet', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'comedy.And', 'got', 'compelling', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'make', 'think', 'make', 'feel', 'kinda', 'way', 'given', 'relatable', 'characters', 'life', 'circumstances', 'would', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fit', 'movie', 'mold', 'typical', 'drama', 'Five', 'Heartbeats', 'loosely', 'autobiographical', 'tale', 'rise', 'fall', 'ultimately', 'triumph', 'life', 'hit', 'five-man', 'R', 'B', 'group', '1960s', 'father', 'uncles', 'have', 'ongoing', 'debate', 'group', 'experiences', 'were', 'based', 'Temptations', 'Four', 'Tops', 'Dells', '.This', 'movie', 'real-enough', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'how', 'money', 'fame', 'stardom', 'can', 'breed', 'distrust', 'hate', 'disloyalty', 'assortment', 'shady', 'dealings', 'could', 'undue', 'family', 'relationship', 'close', 'friendship.The', 'story', 'five', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'start', 'out', 'close', 'friends', 'who', 'share', 'common', 'passion', 'talent', 'singing.Of', 'course', 'get', 'discovered', 'start', 'eventually', 'make', 'big', 'discover', 'moment', 'top', 'filled', 'tragedy', 'anger', 'addictions', 'deceptions', 'kinds', 'realities', 'totally', 'different', 'starry-eyed', 'images', ""'d"", 'had', 'making', 'big', 'once', 'time.Overall', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'uplifting', 'life', 'time', 'five', 'friends', 'eventually', 'overcome', 'past', 'learn', 'invaluable', 'life', 'lessons.This', 'movie', 'families', 'plot', 'various', 'scenes', 'will', 'be', 'interpreted', 'differently', 'kids', 'adults', 'however', 'demographics', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'movie', 'overall', 'theme', 'message.Fame', 'fortune', 'are', 'fleeting', 'Friendships', 'good', 'friendships', 'are', 'priceless.This', 'movie', 'was', 'out', 'out', 'ignored', 'Hollwyood.Easily', 'Robert', 'Townsend', 'best', 'film', 'deserving', 'Academy', 'Award', 'consideration.Awesome', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'blazingly', 'inspiring', 'soundtrack.This', 'movie', 'complete', 'most', 'recommended', 'movie', 'pitch', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'make', 'Amazon', 'one', 'film', 'Guaranteed', 'crowd-pleasing', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'not', 'get', 'tired']",N/A

492706,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,B000005QLP,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[5, 5]","""The Five Heartbeats"", one of my favorite films by Robert Townsend, is a wonderful movie about a fictional singing quintet's rise to fame in the 1960s. It somewhat echoes the story of the Temptations, but in actuality, it could have been a profile of just about any black male singing group of that era (it was supposedly based on the story of The Dells).Reportedly, back in 1991, Robert Townsend said that the script, co-written by himself and Keenen Ivory Wayans, wasn't about any one group in particular, but the trials and tribulations of various black vocal groups of the 1960s. Watching this movie made me think of actual situations that happened to different soul music acts in those days, and even as recent as New Edition, Jodeci and Boyz II Men, so Townsend accomplished his goal successfully. The struggles to get to the top, what happens when you get there, the bonds of friendship, egos, trying to keep up with musical trends and of course, the racism, backstabbing, drug abuse and shady characters -- it's all included here as a very real look into just how ruthless and unforgiving the recording industry can be. ""The Five Heartbeats"" even touches upon how black music was ripped off by greedy industry executives and given to white acts to cover, therefore, ""whitewashing"" it for acceptance by white radio listeners and record buyers. This is a movie that weaves comedy, drama, romance, and music together into a singular treat for the eyes and ears.I have a couple of beefs, though: Why are we hearing Delfonics hits from 1969 and 1970 in scenes that are supposed to be taking place in 1965?! Plus the use of synthesizers weren't really in vogue outside of the studio in 1972, yet you see Robert Townsend's character using one on stage in a scene that is supposed to be happening in that year. Someone should have done more musical research! Also, Robert does a wonderful job directing this film, but he leaves much to be desired as an actor. But those things can be overlooked in light of everything else about this movie.With strong performances from Michael Wright (who is truly exceptional as the troubled lead singer Eddie King, Jr. and the REAL star of this movie), Leon, and Hawthorne James as the villainous Big Red, this film deserves your attention and that of anyone who is a fan of classic soul, the Motown sound, and music PERIOD! Also included in the cast are a couple of Hollywood legends - the beautiful and classy Diahann Carroll and tap dancer extraordinaire Harold Nicholas.
