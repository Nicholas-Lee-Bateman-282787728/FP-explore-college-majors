733227,A3IAP2JMTP5YBN,B0000844I4,"adriana ""alisa""","[55, 63]","Sex And Lucia is one of the best films I've seen in recent memory, and I have seen MANY movies in recent memory. It is a pleasure these days to have a film so fully realized,so organically acted,and so beautifully woven together through a series of loose ends to come to a glorious,and emotional finale.As if that weren't enough,the film is also simply gorgeous to look at, and offers absolutely scrumptious natural images.And it was almost shocking to see sex portrayed in such a natural,tender light.If you're hoping for a soft core porn movie with little plot involved, I couldn't recommend anything less.Sex in this film is used not to fulfill the viewer's libido, but to paint a picture of a blossoming,loving relationshop between two people.But I think the title is misleading and the trailer for this film was misleading because this film is not about sex.Yes, there is a plentiful amount of it(which would only be a shock to us sexually sheltered Americans), but this film is honestly not about sex.What is it about?It's about people, and coincidence,and circumstance,love,depression,heartache,betrayal- sex is just a factor in the film but not a subject.This is an absolutely wonderful film, which moves at a slow pace, but is fully rewarding at the end.Sex and Lucia is a film that I would recommend to ANY person on the planet who loves great films.Well, you're in for a treat because this one is remarkable.",5,A WONDERFUL film,1079827200,"03 21, 2004",2004,1419,"['Sex', 'Lucia', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'memory', 'have', 'seen', 'MANY', 'movies', 'recent', 'memory', 'pleasure', 'days', 'have', 'film', 'so', 'fully', 'realized', 'so', 'organically', 'acted', 'so', 'beautifully', 'woven', 'together', 'series', 'loose', 'ends', 'come', 'glorious', 'emotional', 'finale.As', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'film', 'also', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'absolutely', 'scrumptious', 'natural', 'images.And', 'was', 'almost', 'shocking', 'see', 'sex', 'portrayed', 'natural', 'tender', 'light.If', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'soft', 'core', 'porn', 'movie', 'little', 'plot', 'involved', 'could', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anything', 'less.Sex', 'film', 'used', 'not', 'fulfill', 'viewer', 'libido', 'paint', 'picture', 'blossoming', 'loving', 'relationshop', 'two', 'people.But', 'think', 'title', 'misleading', 'trailer', 'film', 'was', 'misleading', 'film', 'not', 'sex.Yes', 'plentiful', 'amount', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'shock', 'sexually', 'sheltered', 'Americans', 'film', 'honestly', 'not', 'sex.What', 'people', 'coincidence', 'circumstance', 'love', 'depression', 'heartache', 'betrayal-', 'sex', 'just', 'factor', 'film', 'not', 'subject.This', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'film', 'slow', 'pace', 'fully', 'rewarding', 'end.Sex', 'Lucia', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'ANY', 'person', 'planet', 'who', 'great', 'films.Well', ""'re"", 'treat', 'one', 'remarkable']",N/A

733231,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B0000844I4,Amanda,"[48, 51]","Ok. To start things off, I will say that ""Sex and Lucia"" is VERY deserving of its unrated rating - a lot of the scenes in the film look as though they deserve to be in a x-rated flick. However, there is one thing that separates this film from an x-rated one: a good story.A lot of films (especially foreign ones) that have a lot of sexually-explicit material in them seem to use the sex to sell the film; they might as well just say in the trailers, ""Look at us! We're being risque! We dare you to watch this and not blush! Wanna see an adult film, but are too embarrassed to? Come see this instead!"" But ""Sex and Lucia"", or in its native Spanish language ""Lucia y el Sexo"", is nothing like that. Yes there are many scenes that could make one blush, and yes most of those scenes are gratuitous. But what saves this film from being like all the rest is the fact that the plot is interesting. And at about half-way through when I thought I maybe knew what would happen in the end, I was proved wrong when I finished the whole movie - and was pleasantly surprised.Lucia is a young woman who falls in love with a writer named Lorenzo. She tells him she loves him about two minutes after introducing herself. The two move in together, and what follows are the above-mentioned blush-worthy scenes. But once the film gets past all the racy stuff, what lies beneath is really a great love story, that has some tragedy thrown in for good measure.The film is more than two hours, but I didn't even notice - there were really no boring parts that I can remember. A soundtrack plays softly in the background, and even though you barely notice it, you are very aware of it and it sets the mood for the film. The location where a lot of the film was shot (in the scenes on the island) is beautiful and at times distracts you from the actors. And speaking of the actors, they all did a top-notch job. Now, I have seen a lot of foreign films, but this is one of the best. ""The Piano Teacher"" is another provocative unrated foreign film, but that one left me frustrated and depressed. By the end of ""Sex and Lucia"", I had a smile on my face. I think the ending will be a little surprising to some people, because it was not at all what I was expecting - it was perfect. I just rented it and watched it today, but I will definitely be purchasing it. I recommend this film to anyone who loves a good story, who doesn't mind subtitles and, oh yeah, someone who doesn't blush so easily.",5,Excelente!,1048550400,"03 25, 2003",2003,2465,"['Ok.', 'start', 'things', 'will', 'say', 'Sex', 'Lucia', 'VERY', 'deserving', 'unrated', 'rating', 'lot', 'scenes', 'film', 'look', 'deserve', 'be', 'x-rated', 'flick', 'However', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'x-rated', 'one', 'good', 'story.A', 'lot', 'films', 'especially', 'foreign', 'ones', 'have', 'lot', 'sexually-explicit', 'material', 'seem', 'use', 'sex', 'sell', 'film', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'say', 'trailers', 'Look', ""'re"", 'being', 'risque', 'dare', 'watch', 'not', 'blush', 'Wan', 'see', 'adult', 'film', 'are', 'too', 'embarrassed', 'Come', 'see', 'instead', 'Sex', 'Lucia', 'native', 'Spanish', 'language', 'Lucia', 'y', 'el', 'Sexo', 'nothing', 'Yes', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'could', 'make', 'one', 'blush', 'yes', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'gratuitous', 'what', 'film', 'being', 'rest', 'fact', 'plot', 'interesting', 'half-way', 'when', 'thought', 'maybe', 'knew', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'end', 'was', 'proved', 'wrong', 'when', 'finished', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.Lucia', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'writer', 'named', 'Lorenzo', 'two', 'minutes', 'introducing', 'two', 'move', 'together', 'what', 'are', 'above-mentioned', 'blush-worthy', 'scenes', 'once', 'film', 'racy', 'stuff', 'what', 'beneath', 'really', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'tragedy', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure.The', 'film', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'were', 'really', 'boring', 'parts', 'can', 'remember', 'soundtrack', 'softly', 'background', 'even', 'barely', 'notice', 'are', 'very', 'aware', 'mood', 'film', 'location', 'where', 'lot', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'scenes', 'island', 'beautiful', 'times', 'distracts', 'actors', 'speaking', 'actors', 'did', 'top-notch', 'job', 'Now', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'foreign', 'films', 'one', 'best', 'Piano', 'Teacher', 'provocative', 'unrated', 'foreign', 'film', 'one', 'left', 'frustrated', 'depressed', 'end', 'Sex', 'Lucia', 'had', 'smile', 'face', 'think', 'ending', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'surprising', 'people', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'was', 'perfect', 'just', 'rented', 'watched', 'today', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'purchasing', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'story', 'who', ""n't"", 'mind', 'subtitles', 'oh', 'yeah', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'blush', 'so', 'easily']",N/A

This film is as vibrant and unselfconsciously erotically charged as its central character, Lucia, in telling its story of relationships, desire, love and loss. It is casual in showing both male and female nudity with a directness and honesty we aren't used to.A story of the relationship between a writer, the uninhibited and free-spirited waitress who loves him, and the people and events, both past and present that surround and intrude and disrupt that relationship is presented in a convoluted style that shifts back and forth in time.The story is told elliptically and, at some points, somewhat confusingly, but ultimately resolves itself with the various strands of story joining together with its characters in the sharp clarity of an idyllic sun-drenched isle.  Sex in this film is both real and metaphor for those needs and desires that bind us, drive us apart, harm and heal us.

However, that just warrants a second viewing, which I look forward to with much anticipation.S&L; is a ultimately a story about the deepening relationships between lovers, and the degree to which they progress from physical intimacy to emotional intimacy and ultimately life and death.  What appear at the beginning of the film to be casual flings turn into much significant couplings with unanticipated consequences.  The viewer must piece together the overall storyline from the creative vision of writer/director Julio Medem, who jumps back and forth in time and films some scenes with an ethereal, dreamlike quality that has the viewer wondering whether the events portrayed really happened or not.  Medem's techniques create a European art-house cinematic quality for the film, but they also create a puzzle to be solved by the viewer.There are many other attractive elements within S&L;, chief among them two of the lead actresses, the stunningly beautiful Paz Vega in the title role and the equally enticing Elena Aneya in a seductress role.  It is impossible for me to choose which actress is more appealing or who gives a better performance.  Fortunately, we get to see all of the charms of both actresses.  There are several absolutely delicious scenes in the movie, including a loveplay scene with Vega's character Lucia and her partner wielding a Polaroid camera, and a seduction scene in a park with Aneya's character Belen, in which she entices her prey by explaining her mom's profession and her living arrangements.  The male character in both of these scenes, Lorenzo, is a tortured writer, but with women like this in his life, one has to wonder a bit why he is suffering so much.That said, there are a few weak components of S&L.;  The actors playing the roles of Lorenzo (Tristan Ulloa) and the role of Elena (Najwa Nimri) weren't well cast, in my opinion.  It was hard for me to believe Ulloa was an intellectual, and Nimri seemed a little old for her role, and was nowhere near as enticing as the other two female leads.

As the movie unfolds, the scenes cut back to Lucia in the present, where she is on an island Lorenzo frequented in the past and becoming a guest of Elena, and reflecting back on how she first met Lorenzo, a novelist.  Lucia is very impulsive and passionate, as she outright tells her feelings to Lorenzo at a restaurant, becoming his girlfriend.However, we also see how Lorenzo encountered Elena in a midnight swim on an island on his birthday.  He eventually abandoned her after she became pregnant and bore him a daughter.Through his publisher colleague Pepe, Lorenzo learns of his ex-wife through seeing her babysitter, Belen.  The conversations and actions in his novel begin to mirror talks and encounters with Belen and his daughter.  The island and the imagined wishes of his daughter to find out who her father is plays out in the novel, as does the affair he had with Elena.  One particular incident though, turns the tide for Lorenzo, causing his deterioration, through which Lucia tries patiently to understand.The full frontal scenes mostly involve Lucia but there is some male scenes as well, which aren't excessive, and there is a particularly sexy striptease which makes things hot, but nothing compares to their initial bedroom romps.Paz Vega (Lucia) resembles Winona Ryder with a dolled up version of Ana Torrent thrown in the mix.  Tristan Ulloa (Lorenzo) resembles Gary Oldman.  If Elena and that low melodic voice, unique nose, and pointed chin look familiar, that's Najwa Nimri, best known to American audiences (I hope) for playing Nuria in Abre Los Ojos.

There is a strong story peopled with interesting characters that you care about. The eroticism of Sex and Lucia is part of the lives of the character and is not introduced gratuitously.The story, simply put, centers on Luc&iacute;a, who is a young waitress in a restaurant in Madrid.  After the loss of her writer boyfriend (Lorenzo), she seeks refuge on a quiet, secluded Mediterranean island that Lorenzo told her about and wanted to return to for a visit.  On the island, Luc&iacute;a begins to discover something of the dark side of her relationship with Lorenzo through a novel he was working on.There are strong performances by Paz Vega (as Lucia), Tristan Uolla (as Lorenzo) and Najwa Nimri (as Elena who runs a small hotel on the island). Director Julio Medem has made a film that explored love and relationships in a thought provoking story, beautifully filmed.

Paz Vega (Lucia), who looks like a warmer, more resilient Winona Ryder, has an expressive face and also dives into the very explicit sex scenes bravely.  The chemistry between her and Tristan Ulloa, as lover Lorenzo, provides the film's emotional center.  And the photography is beautiful and expressive, working hand in hand with the music to create a lovely mood against which the romance can play out.A shame, then, that the editing pretty much destroys many key scenes.  Director Julio Medem seems especially fond of hyperspeed cutting and senseless jump cuts.  During Lucia and Lorenzo's first love scene, the lovely delicacy of the actors' physical behaviour is simply destroyed by all the intrusive fast cuts, dehumanizing the actors into a series of film blips.  In fact, the fast cutting gave me a bad case of eye fatigue -- like a death-metal soundtrack  intruding in on a romantic film.  And that's not the only time -- the striptease scene (where Ulloa and Vega's performances are especially endearing) and Lucia's humiliating, disturbing masturbation scene are both badly cut.The film is also a little too long for my taste and at a certain point, the high-mindedness of the lovely music and cinematography did become tiring, losing some of the intimacy in favour of heavy-handed poeticizing.",2,"Would have been good, except...",1050883200,"04 21, 2003",2003,1471,"['Sex', 'Lucia', 'one-half', 'moving', 'psychological', 'probe', 'romance', 'one-half', 'attention-deficit', 'cinematic', 'showoff.The', 'two', 'leads', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'Lucia', 'who', 'warmer', 'more', 'resilient', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'expressive', 'face', 'also', 'very', 'explicit', 'sex', 'scenes', 'bravely', 'chemistry', 'Tristan', 'Ulloa', 'lover', 'Lorenzo', 'film', 'emotional', 'center', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'expressive', 'working', 'hand', 'hand', 'music', 'create', 'lovely', 'mood', 'romance', 'can', 'play', 'out.A', 'shame', 'then', 'editing', 'pretty', 'much', 'many', 'key', 'scenes', 'Director', 'Julio', 'Medem', 'especially', 'fond', 'hyperspeed', 'cutting', 'senseless', 'jump', 'cuts', 'Lucia', 'Lorenzo', 'first', 'love', 'scene', 'lovely', 'delicacy', 'actors', 'physical', 'behaviour', 'simply', 'destroyed', 'intrusive', 'fast', 'cuts', 'dehumanizing', 'actors', 'series', 'film', 'blips', 'fact', 'fast', 'cutting', 'gave', 'bad', 'case', 'eye', 'fatigue', 'death-metal', 'soundtrack', 'intruding', 'romantic', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'time', 'striptease', 'scene', 'where', 'Ulloa', 'Vega', 'performances', 'are', 'especially', 'endearing', 'Lucia', 'humiliating', 'disturbing', 'masturbation', 'scene', 'are', 'badly', 'cut.The', 'film', 'also', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'taste', 'certain', 'point', 'high-mindedness', 'lovely', 'music', 'cinematography', 'did', 'become', 'tiring', 'losing', 'intimacy', 'favour', 'heavy-handed', 'poeticizing']",N/A

She seeks only a wild erotic encounter with another naked traveler (Lorenzo). The stranger doesn't want to know her name nor she his; its a purely erotic surrender to the power of fantasy uncomplicated by anything real. Both agree that it is the most intense sex they have ever had. Just for fun they exchange a few facts: dates of birth, hometowns, occupations.However, as a result of this surreal encounter Elena becomes pregnant. And thereafter she searches for the anonymous father of her child who she names ""Luna""--the daughter is a living reminder of that otherworldly night. Everyone in this story is a creator, and everyone is seduced by other's stories; the characters live in their own interconnectiong and overlapping spells.Lorenzo...is a writer whose erotic imagination allows him to create rich imaginative realms and stories that are more like spells. He is a writer who prefers to live in his own fictional worlds than to confront the complications of real people and real life, but real life cannot be altogether avoided and when something tragic happens to one of Lorenzo's  creations, he is forced to re-imagine the uses to which the creative imagination can be put and to re-think the constructive relation between real life and storytelling.Lucia: While reading one of his books, Lucia falls in love with novelist Lorenzo's words and decides to track him down. She finds him at a restaurant in Madrid and there immediately professes her love for him the first moment they set eyes on each other. She is a character as beautiful and unreal as any a novelist could invent and for this reason Lorenzo immediately falls in love with her as well. They move in together and begin a life full of erotic fantasy and experimentation, for awhile anyway. But in time the spell begins to lose some of its escapist magic, and Lorenzo's fictional world (which is informed by memory of his island encounter with Elena) slowly reclaims him.Complicating the neat divide between fact and fiction, Lorenzo learns from his publisher that he has a daughter (the result of the moonlit encounter that so seductively haunts him) named ""Luna"".Belen: Lorenzo wants to see his daughter without seeing Elena and so he goes to the park where a babysitter named Belen takes her to play. There Lorenzo and Belen develop a friendship based on mutually confessed fantasies about others that become fantasies about each other. They decide to act out their fantasues in real life, but something terrible happens the night that they get together.Lorenzo finds that he cannot cope with the tragedy. As a result of his debilitating depression his relationship with Lucia suffers and the two have a terrible fight one night and Lucia after delivering some harsh words about what it is really like living with a ghost, goes off to work. When Lucia comes home from work that night she discovers that Lorenzo is gone, the phone rings and its the police informing her that...Assuming that Lorenzo is dead, Lucia heads off to the island that is featured in the book that he was writing before he disappeared. There she begins the difficult task of separating the facts of her own life with Lorenzo from the fiction. But that is no easy task.

It's not quite as distracting and confusing as it was in ""21 Grams"" because the story here is fairly simple.  The plot also requires a fair amount of belief suspension: it's a bit much for us to believe that such a stunning juicy tamale like Paz would out of nowhere throw herself upon the nerdy writer-protagonist, but if you've ever been a nerdy writer type yourself I suppose that's a gratifying fantasy, hee hee.Where ""Sex and Lucia"" triumphs is in its sheer physical beauty and sensual richness.  Few movies provide so much visual pleasure, and not only in the generous sex scenes but just overall, you really FEEL that ""yes this is definitely a Spanish movie shot in Spain.""  You would never mistake this for some cheesy sterile Hollywood set.  The whole spirit of the film is one of divine hedonistic abandon, the kind of guilt- and hangup-free vibe that American and British cinema still struggles to come up with, and something that the Spanish and Italians seem to have a monopoly on.My only wish is that it had been shot on normal film instead of digital, because many of the exterior shots in bright sunlight are overexposed and washed out.God bless Paz Vega a thousand times, may she live forever!

The two meet under terrifically charged circumstances, and their lives together reach a feverish intimate crescendo.However, Lorenzo begins to fathom the consequences of the life he's led, leading him on a quest to understand who he is and how he could possibly have reached a new low in his life.  Happiness thwarts his talents, and, instead, he allows the moments of human weakness he's experienced to drive him as emotionally low as a human being can possibly slip ... to the brink of death.In the meantime, Lucia flees, unable to cope with the reality of Lorenzo's possible fate, and inadvertantly discovers that the life she's been leading is secretly intertwined with others, much in the way good novels unfold.Note quite a ""date movie"" (though I'm sure it might serve some inspiration), SEX AND LUCIA is intended for adult audiences.",5,Wonderfully Hypnotic,1053561600,"05 22, 2003",2003,1518,"['SEX', 'LUCIA', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'blend', 'sex', 'story', 'plot', 'circumstance', 'reality', 'art', 'crafting', 'fiction', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'poignant', 'wild', 'portrayal', 'unabashedly', 'adult', 'sex', 'equally', 'balanced', 'mature', 'themes', 'surrounding', 'human', 'condition', 'exploring', 'life', 'liveliness', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'quite', 'before.Sumptuously', 'photographed', 'tropical', 'islands', 'not', 'overloaded', 'lush', 'foliage', 'SEX', 'AND', 'LUCIA', 'several', 'storylines', 'uniquely', 'intertwined', 'Lucia', 'exploration', 'find', 'happiness', 'Lorenzo', 'quest', 'understand', 'life', 'hidden', 'art', 'writing', 'two', 'meet', 'terrifically', 'charged', 'circumstances', 'lives', 'together', 'reach', 'feverish', 'intimate', 'crescendo.However', 'Lorenzo', 'fathom', 'consequences', 'life', 'led', 'leading', 'quest', 'understand', 'who', 'how', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'reached', 'new', 'low', 'life', 'Happiness', 'talents', 'instead', 'moments', 'human', 'weakness', 'experienced', 'drive', 'emotionally', 'low', 'human', 'being', 'can', 'possibly', 'slip', 'brink', 'death.In', 'meantime', 'Lucia', 'unable', 'cope', 'reality', 'Lorenzo', 'possible', 'fate', 'inadvertantly', 'discovers', 'life', 'been', 'leading', 'secretly', 'intertwined', 'others', 'much', 'way', 'good', 'novels', 'unfold.Note', 'quite', 'date', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'might', 'serve', 'inspiration', 'SEX', 'AND', 'LUCIA', 'intended', 'adult', 'audiences']",N/A

Not since the amazing films of Alain Renais has there been a film so emersed in physical beauty, in bewildering undertones,  in challenging paths for the viewer to let go of the world as we see it and discover places and feelings once the sole territory of the Surrealists.  This magical movie resembles Renais' LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD but it is in color, is much more advanced in its sexuality, and fleshes out its story with more profound philosophical views.  The cast is very fine without focusing on well known actors (in this country at least) to provide a prejudged concept of the characters examined.

733262,A33TRNCQK4IUO7,B0000844I4,guillermoj,"[72, 76]","Although there is a lot of sex in this story and there is a woman named Lucia, the title and marketing campaign are somewhat misleading as it's less about sex of sexual liberation than it is about life, possibilities, dreams, and almost any topic under the sun.In a nutshell, I simply loved everything about this movie and it is one of the best movies that I've ever seen. I won't give much away as I hate it when reviewers/previews tell you what you should be seeing first-hand.I can say that the movie unfolds beautifully like a great fairy-tale/dream sequence/life experience and that the specifics of the plot and circumstance are less important than every single character in the movie. The performances are stellar, the direction is as good as I've seen, the music is beautiful, the cinematography is innovative and better than I've ever seen, and (unlike almost every single movie) I had no idea where the movie was heading.The movie opens with one of the most romantic and beautiful scenes in movie history and it does not let you go until the final frame. I won't spoil some of the poetic images that you'll encounter, but trust me you'll want to see this movie again just to experience it visually.This is without a doubt a movie for adults and not solely because of the explicitness of the sex but because the themes are for mature audiences. As I watched this movie, I kept asking myself how Hollywood would have botched up this movie as there are very few movies for adults and even fewer that are this compelling with out being pretentious.I've recently began watching more Spanish speaking movies and I am surprised by the how movies from Spain and recently Mexico and Argentina are kicking Hollywood's butt, not only due to content but in looking like a million bucks without spending them.I just saw this movie and I can't wait to see it again. Keep in mind that the sex is very explicit and although I said it's an adult movie, I'd recommend seeing it with people from your own generation. In other words, I would not see this movie with my parents, although I would highly recommend it to them.",5,What a hypnotic movie experience.

The story pushes you to the limit of possibilities. As the story says if you don't like the ending, at the end of the story there is a little hole that takes you back to the middle of the story and you can rewrite the story to change the outcome.The beauty of this movie is so multi-dimensional. The love that Lucia and Lorenzo have for each other is deep and enduring, nurturing, accepting and playful. ""Sex and Lucia"" is one of the most positive portrayals of love and sexuality . Critics applauded this film as ""the steamiest film of the year,"" back in 2001 of course. Yet, it is more than that. Not only are we able to experience the best of romantic love, we are also offered the very meaning of life. Artfully, so masterfully, Julio Medem brings us the theme that ""sometimes you fall through a hole in life, a place where the sun and moon come together. When this happens, you have the power to completely recreate your life."" This merger, falling and recreation is what this film is all about. This process of creation underlies the very sexual nature of all existence, which the film illustrates so powerfully. The film guides us deeply into the feminine, deeply into the masculine. We are entranced with the dance of dark and light coming together to produce bliss. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. Suspend your mind. You won't be able to follow all the bizarre coincidences, plot twists, and intentionally perception-bending twists and turns, but you will know the power of acceptance and faith in healing a love relationship.A MUST SEE!!! For those international movie fans this is a movie to choose if you're unable to decide on a foreign film.

OK, now that we got the sick part out of the way; I must admit, that besides the many scenes involving her, that this movie was pretty good. I don't know about ""The most wondrous love story in years"" as the back cover proclaims, but it's pretty good. Vega (of 'Spanglish' fame) playsLucia, a waitress who's boyfriend Lorenzo (Tristan Ulloa) is apparently killed. Distraught, Lucia heads to a Mediterranean Island where she meetsElena (who has a tie to Lorenzo's past) and Carlos, the man staying there.At the island, Lucia begins to look back on her relationship with Lorenzo. But, hold on, instead of just a movie about Lucia reflecting on her life; she virtually disappears from the movie for a little bit while we learn more about Lorenzo. Lorenzo is a novelist, working on a novel, and discovers that he fathered a child with Elena years ago. The daughter's name is Luna and she is being taken care of by a young girl named Belen, who lives with her porn star mom and her mother's boyfriend. Lorenzo stars a pseudo-affair with Belen, while trying to connect with his daughter. The actress who plays Belen, Elena Anaya, is very hot. Anyway, that's the basic plot for you. The movie, in case you hadn't figured it out by now, is a foreign movie just so those people who hate reading subtitles are aware of it. I also wanted to mention that, as I said, this a good movie and all, but there are times when it lags big time. Hence, the 4 stars instead of 5 stars.

733273,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0000844I4,Linda Linguvic,"[3, 4]","The 2001 Spanish film directed by Julio Medem is visually engaging and terribly confusing.  It's a mixture of reality and fantasy and it's impossible to tell the difference.  And even when it was over, I wasn't quite sure what actually happened.  I was fascinated, however, and couldn't stop watching.The film is set in modern Spain, where a waitress, played by Paz Vega, learns that her writer-boyfriend, played by Tristan Ulloa, has been in an accident.  Believing him dead, she travels to a special unnamed island to discover the secret that plagued him for the past few months.  They've been living together for six years and their relationship was good until recently.  The audience is also treated to extremely explicit romantic scenes between the two of them, which stretch the limits of what is usually shown on a screen.There's a back-story too, about an erotic adventure the boyfriend had with a stranger on the island.  Unbeknownst to him, this union has resulted in a lovely little four-year old girl.  The boyfriend hears of the child and goes to see her in a playground.  Her nanny is young and attractive and more erotic scenes follow.  The resultant tragedy from this encounter is the cause of his depression.As he's a writer, he writes about all of this and it's never clear what is fact or what is fiction.  It's all very dreamlike, as the story gets more and more complicated.  It's a daring and sensual film, which jumps back and forth with plot.  I found myself trying to make sense of it all, but the minute I thought I understood what was happening, everything would change and I never did put the pieces together.I was able to enjoy the film, but only after I realized that I had to suspend my belief in logic. I can therefore only recommend it to the adventuresome few.",4,Daring and sensual film.

This is a visually stunning film to watch. The location scenery is breathtaking. The story of Lucia takes you from the city to an almost magical island where healing of the soul is found in it's beauty. Lucia (Paz Vega) is running from the death of her writer lover Lorenzo (Tristan Ulloa). She fled before hearing the full story. The island is where Lorenzo is from but didn't want to return to because of a tragedy of his own. He was in the process of writing a story incorporating the tragedy in hopes of healing himself. Lucia becomes involved with some inhabitants of the island not knowing that her presence will bring things full circle eventually. Simply fascinating story telling is what this film brings you along with the visuals. The actors are perfect. Julio Medem takes what could have been an enormously confusing mess and crafted a wonderful film experience that will demand repeat viewings. There is so much to talk about in this film.

Upon returning to their apartment, she got a phone call from the police to say that the boyfriend was involved in an accident.  She hang up the phone, clouting herself from the possibility that Lorenzo might be dead.  Off she went to Lorenzo's island, the island that mystified or haunted Lorenzo all this while.  As she was there, we were brought to the past, to the beginning when it all started between Lucia & Lorenzo.  Slowly, Lorenzo's mental block for his new novel started to be uplifted & we were introduced to the daughter, Luna that Lorenzo had with a woman on that island (a one night stand affair).  As the movie progressed, we were also introduced to the au-pair or baby sitter that looked after Luna.  The baby sitter confided to Lorenzo about her lust for her mum's live-in partner.  It also happened that the baby sitter's mum was a porn movie star.  Deep in his subconsciousness, Lorenzo had lust for the babysitter.  How would all those characters relate to each other, and where does this movie lead us, you might ask.  At times, I got myself confused as the movie shifted aimlessly between fact & fiction; past, present, & future.  Somehow or rather, it all came together in the end, a very satisfying end, I might add.  In some instances, when we watch an art movie, we might come across some endings that would have us exclaim, Huh?  However, for this instance, all loose ends were tied up. It also affirmed to me about the point people having seven degrees of separation.  Everybody knows everybody, & everybody is interrelated with everybody.

733286,A379FTDQT1NKSN,B0000844I4,Robert Pratte,"[20, 20]","This is a complex film with bits of drama, eroticism, fantasy, and the quest built in.  Moreover, time, place, person, and even identity shift throughout the film, preventing the viewer from establishing a sense of grounding.  The film itself is much like the island in the story: it is full of holes and caves that connect back, but ultimately nothing connects to the ""reality"" of Earth.  Intellectually, it is playful and enjoyable.One aspect of this film is its visual impact.  Many of the scenes of the island are absolutely gorgeous, reinforcing the idea that there is something magical about it.  This is also a film full of ""beautiful people"" in that the people who fill the screen are carefully chosen - never old, fat, or ugly.  However, the scenes also tend to be quiet and personal, without crowds, large landscapes, or superfluous details.  Visually, it is a treat.As for the plot, there is a bit of a David Lynch, modern surrealist feel to much of it.  We are introduced to Lucia in the midst of tragedy: after she fights with her boyfriend, Lorenzo, he is involved in an accident.  The rest of the film alternates between a history leading to the fight and Lucia's attempts to recover from her loss.  The magic here is how writer/director Julio Medem presents the interwoven threads.The island plays a central role in both Lorenzo's history and Lucia's future.  In the midst of the intertwined stories we learn about the island, Elena (a woman who unexpectedly ties Lucia and Lorenzo together), and Luna (Elena and Lorenzo's daughter).  The latter provides the catalyst for Lorenzo's descent as he becomes obsessed with her, her sitter (Bel&eacute;n), and the tragedy that claims her.  The story of Bel&eacute;n, in turn, provides a series of twists and characters that lead back to Lucia and the island.  Emphasis is placed on twists, as characters ""become"" and parallel each other in just-shy-of-confusing fashion.  The effect of this undermines the viewer's confidence in the reality of what occurs (both in the history and on the island).  It also provides a fairy-tale feel to the film.One other aspect of this film worth noting is the ""Sex"" half of the title.  Sexy scenes aboud, particularly in the first portion of film, and some of these are fairly explicit, but after awhile they really don't seem to add anything to the film.  That isn't to say that they are simply there as gratuitous eroticism, but that the ""Lucia"" portion of the film could quite easily stand on its own without them.  Only a few, such as the moonlight conception scene, really seem tightly coupled to the story, whereas others verge on beating a dead horse.  Frankly, I feel that better integration here would have made this a stellar film.Overall, this is an excellent film, with great writing, fantastic photography, and engaging acting.  If you enjoy modern fairy tales such as Amelie, the surrealism of directors such as David Lynch, or the personal feel of films such as Michael Radford's Il Postino, then this is a highly recommended film.",4,A fairy tale for adults,1120262400,"07 2, 2005",2005,3041,"['complex', 'film', 'bits', 'drama', 'eroticism', 'fantasy', 'quest', 'built', 'Moreover', 'time', 'place', 'person', 'even', 'identity', 'shift', 'film', 'preventing', 'viewer', 'establishing', 'sense', 'grounding', 'film', 'much', 'island', 'story', 'full', 'holes', 'caves', 'connect', 'back', 'ultimately', 'nothing', 'connects', 'reality', 'Earth', 'Intellectually', 'playful', 'enjoyable.One', 'aspect', 'film', 'visual', 'impact', 'Many', 'scenes', 'island', 'are', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'reinforcing', 'idea', 'something', 'magical', 'also', 'film', 'full', 'beautiful', 'people', 'people', 'who', 'fill', 'screen', 'are', 'carefully', 'chosen', 'never', 'old', 'fat', 'ugly', 'However', 'scenes', 'also', 'tend', 'be', 'quiet', 'personal', 'crowds', 'large', 'landscapes', 'superfluous', 'details', 'Visually', 'treat.As', 'plot', 'bit', 'David', 'Lynch', 'modern', 'surrealist', 'feel', 'much', 'are', 'introduced', 'Lucia', 'midst', 'tragedy', 'boyfriend', 'Lorenzo', 'involved', 'accident', 'rest', 'film', 'history', 'leading', 'fight', 'Lucia', 'attempts', 'recover', 'loss', 'magic', 'here', 'how', 'writer/director', 'Julio', 'Medem', 'interwoven', 'threads.The', 'island', 'central', 'role', 'Lorenzo', 'history', 'Lucia', 'future', 'midst', 'intertwined', 'stories', 'learn', 'island', 'Elena', 'woman', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'Lucia', 'Lorenzo', 'together', 'Luna', 'Elena', 'Lorenzo', 'daughter', 'latter', 'catalyst', 'Lorenzo', 'descent', 'obsessed', 'sitter', 'Bel', 'eacute', 'tragedy', 'story', 'Bel', 'eacute', 'turn', 'series', 'twists', 'characters', 'lead', 'back', 'Lucia', 'island', 'Emphasis', 'placed', 'twists', 'characters', 'become', 'parallel', 'other', 'just-shy-of-confusing', 'fashion', 'effect', 'viewer', 'confidence', 'reality', 'what', 'occurs', 'history', 'island', 'also', 'fairy-tale', 'feel', 'film.One', 'other', 'aspect', 'film', 'noting', 'Sex', 'half', 'title', 'Sexy', 'scenes', 'aboud', 'particularly', 'first', 'portion', 'film', 'are', 'fairly', 'explicit', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'add', 'anything', 'film', ""n't"", 'say', 'are', 'simply', 'there', 'gratuitous', 'eroticism', 'Lucia', 'portion', 'film', 'could', 'quite', 'easily', 'stand', 'own', 'Only', 'few', 'such', 'moonlight', 'conception', 'scene', 'really', 'seem', 'tightly', 'coupled', 'story', 'others', 'verge', 'beating', 'dead', 'horse', 'Frankly', 'feel', 'better', 'integration', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'stellar', 'film.Overall', 'excellent', 'film', 'great', 'writing', 'fantastic', 'photography', 'engaging', 'acting', 'enjoy', 'modern', 'fairy', 'tales', 'such', 'Amelie', 'surrealism', 'directors', 'such', 'David', 'Lynch', 'personal', 'feel', 'films', 'such', 'Michael', 'Radford', 'Il', 'Postino', 'then', 'highly', 'recommended', 'film']",N/A

But the film's strength is not that part; it is the beautiful photography and great acting by Paz Vega as Lucia, the title role of the film.The film begins with Lucia talking over phone to her boyfriend who, it seems, is thinking about suicide.  Desperate Lucia goes back to their room, only to find that he is not there.  Since then, the film starts to show its peculiar trait -- it jumps back and forth between the past and the present, the reality and fiction (Lucia's boyfriend Lorenzo is a novelist).  You see Lucia standing at the rocky coast of a tiny island; she stumbles into a hole only to find a cave (meaning hidden side of her life?); and the story goes back to 6 years ago, when Lorenzo and Lucia started seeing each other, but even then he seems to have had an affair with another lady on the island ....The script of ""Sex and Lucia"" is so intricately woven that to say anything about it means a disservice to the tantalizing complexity.  The reason is probably the director Julio Medem's penchant for teasing the audience's expectations, and he was good at it as is seen in his previous ""Lovers of the Arctic Circle.""  Perhaps he wanted to do a brighter (and more complicated) story for the next film; if so, he succeeds well.However, I for one prefer the love story of Ana and Otto described in ""Lovers of the Arctic Circle.""  (Incidentally, Najwa Nimri, ""Ana"" comes back here again.)  ""Sex and Lucia,"" though never boring, has too many characters, and some scenes, which get very close to pretentiousness, are still unclear to me.  What ever happended to the girl and the dog?  What is the meaning of lying among the mud?  Perhaps I am a slow learner; still I believe that I am not the only one who scratched the head, trying to figure out the way to make them out.  I heard that Julio Medem thought about the story of Lucia first, and the ""Sexo"" part, and mixed the latter into the first.  That might be the reason of complex nature of the film.The film should be (and actually is) Lucia's.  Paz Vega's convincing acting single-handedly creates the character of Lucia, who is both frail and strong, rivetting the eye of the audience.  The film has lots of sex, but what we are really attracted to is her great performance.  See it as her film.",3,"Beautiful, Passionate, and ...

733302,A21WMACLYWYJAT,B0000844I4,"""vampyroboy""","[8, 25]","One thing that separates cinema from literature and the theater is verisimilitude.  True, with the advent of computer-generated animation, there is little one cannot do in the movies, but its greatest virtue remains its incredible ability to show us ""life as such.""  Drama on the silver screen HAS to be believable.  When films are full of incredible circumstances, they tend to be comical (e.g., Todd Solondz's work.)  Sci-fi and fantasy are also genres in which wild happenstance is easily accepted, because we suspend disbelief from the get-go.  It is extremely difficult to construct dramas that work this way, however, without giving them that melodramatic, daytime-TV feel.""Sex and Luc&iacute;a"" looks and feels like an art film.  It has an eye-catching title and an even more eye-catching photo on the cover.  The problems begin when the titles finish.  An unnamed couple has an idyllic one-night stand on a tropical island.  Later, the male tryster meets Luc&iacute;a in a bar.  He is a novelist and Luc&iacute;a, in reading his recent book, has become obsessed with him, following him around Madrid.  She professes her love for Lorenzo and tells him that she is moving in with him.  Stunned, he accepts.  Only later does he discover the great secret from his past... a secret that sets off a chain of events which threatens to drive Luc&iacute;a away and Lorenzo to disaster.  Throughout the next hour and a half... all of the players in the drama (most of who have nothing to do with each other) meet by random chance.  There is simmering sexual tension.Sound a little corny?  You betcha.There have been some fantastic Spanish directors down the years: Bu&ntilde;uel, Almod&oacute;var, Berlanga, etc.  Of those active, Berlanga is past his prime, Saura and Amen&aacute;bar make commercial films of questionable value and Aranda... while occasionally impressive... has nothing new to say.  Victor Erice is incredibly talented but has only made four films over the last 30 years.  This leaves us with ""indie"" directors, like Laura Ma&ntilde;&aacute; and ""Sex and Luc&iacute;a"" director Julio Medem, who use sensationalism to sell tickets.  And, after all, what is more sensational (so to speak) than sex?  The biggest problem with ""Sex and Luc&iacute;a"", though, is that it simply isn't sexy.  Or, rather: If you find naughty nannies who masturbate to films of their porn star mothers sexy, this is the film for you.  [N.B.: There are even hints at bestiality in the movie on which the astute viewer will pick up.]  And what's more... there are very few scenes of Luc&iacute;a actually having sex... and they're BORING!  The only plausible reason behind the film's title is that it looks good on marquees, a Blockbuster rack, etc.Thankfully, director Medem gives ""advantages"" (?), such as an escape tunnel at the end of the film... something similar to what one might find in a ""Donnie Darko"" or ""The Sacrifice.""  Honestly, this is the kind of film that won't age well, in the same sense that ""A Man and a Woman"" no longer seems like this incredible romance movie that it once was believed to be.  In the end, the greatest ""advantage"" this film has to offer is that you don't have to buy it.  You can save your money for the next Almod&oacute;var flick.",2,"further proof that ""sex sells""",1059782400,"08 2, 2003",2003,3261,"['One', 'thing', 'cinema', 'literature', 'theater', 'verisimilitude', 'True', 'advent', 'computer-generated', 'animation', 'little', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'movies', 'greatest', 'virtue', 'incredible', 'ability', 'show', 'life', 'such', 'Drama', 'silver', 'screen', 'HAS', 'be', 'believable', 'When', 'films', 'are', 'full', 'incredible', 'circumstances', 'tend', 'be', 'comical', 'e.g.', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'work', 'Sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'are', 'also', 'genres', 'wild', 'happenstance', 'easily', 'accepted', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'get-go', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'construct', 'dramas', 'work', 'way', 'however', 'giving', 'melodramatic', 'daytime-TV', 'feel', 'Sex', 'Luc', 'iacute', 'feels', 'art', 'film', 'eye-catching', 'title', 'even', 'more', 'eye-catching', 'photo', 'cover', 'problems', 'begin', 'when', 'titles', 'finish', 'unnamed', 'couple', 'idyllic', 'one-night', 'stand', 'tropical', 'island', 'Later', 'male', 'tryster', 'meets', 'Luc', 'iacute', 'bar', 'novelist', 'Luc', 'iacute', 'reading', 'recent', 'book', 'become', 'obsessed', 'following', 'Madrid', 'love', 'Lorenzo', 'moving', 'Stunned', 'Only', 'later', 'discover', 'great', 'secret', 'past', 'secret', 'off', 'chain', 'events', 'drive', 'Luc', 'iacute', 'away', 'Lorenzo', 'disaster', 'next', 'hour', 'half', 'players', 'drama', 'most', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'other', 'meet', 'random', 'chance', 'simmering', 'sexual', 'little', 'corny', 'betcha.There', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic', 'Spanish', 'directors', 'down', 'years', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'Almod', 'oacute', 'var', 'Berlanga', 'etc', 'active', 'Berlanga', 'prime', 'Saura', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'make', 'commercial', 'films', 'questionable', 'value', 'Aranda', 'occasionally', 'impressive', 'nothing', 'new', 'say', 'Victor', 'Erice', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'only', 'made', 'four', 'films', 'last', '30', 'years', 'indie', 'directors', 'Laura', 'Ma', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'Sex', 'Luc', 'iacute', 'director', 'Julio', 'Medem', 'who', 'use', 'sensationalism', 'sell', 'tickets', 'what', 'more', 'sensational', 'so', 'speak', 'sex', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Sex', 'Luc', 'iacute', 'simply', ""n't"", 'sexy', 'rather', 'find', 'naughty', 'nannies', 'who', 'masturbate', 'films', 'porn', 'star', 'mothers', 'sexy', 'film', '[', 'N.B', 'are', 'even', 'hints', 'bestiality', 'movie', 'astute', 'viewer', 'will', 'pick', 'up', ']', 'what', 'more', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'scenes', 'Luc', 'iacute', 'actually', 'having', 'sex', ""'re"", 'BORING', 'only', 'plausible', 'reason', 'film', 'title', 'good', 'marquees', 'Blockbuster', 'rack', 'etc.Thankfully', 'director', 'Medem', 'advantages', 'such', 'escape', 'tunnel', 'end', 'film', 'something', 'similar', 'what', 'one', 'might', 'find', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Sacrifice', 'Honestly', 'kind', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'age', 'well', 'same', 'sense', 'Man', 'Woman', 'no', 'longer', 'incredible', 'romance', 'movie', 'once', 'was', 'believed', 'be', 'end', 'greatest', 'advantage', 'film', 'offer', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'buy', 'can', 'save', 'money', 'next', 'Almod', 'oacute', 'flick']",N/A
