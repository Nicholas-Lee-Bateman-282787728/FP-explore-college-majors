1160668,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0018PH3K6,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[6, 8]","I went into `The Killing of John Lennon' wanting to be illuminated.  A reenactment rather than a documentary, I was surprised by how much I remembered about Lennon's assassin, Mark David Chapman.  Looking and feeling like many fictionalized Hollywood films, this lurid account provides a great deal of authenticity.  After watching this film, I felt like I had walked in Chapman's shoes, or at least followed his footsteps, and I'm at a loss to state whether I'm better off for having taken that walk.For stylistic techniques, the movie is edited with fastidious finesse.  We get near breaking edge fast-forward, slow motion, and artistic ensemble framing.  Writer/director Andrew Peddington spent a great deal of time and care on this film, and editor Tony Palmer should get some semi-prestigious prize for his outstanding work.  From the beginning, we get the horrible tragedy and then back up again.  They retrace Chapman's life before he made his fateful decision. Interspersed, we see the shooting again, and then again, as the movie marches forward to its inevitable conclusion.  Many times they show a collage of split-second John Lennon pictures frantically flipped across the screen.  I was wondering:  Are they going for suspense or for appreciation?  Wisely, for part of the last thirty-five minutes or so, they give us plenty of old news reels to help us grieve once more.  It may actually be both, but I'd be hard pressed to say the filmmakers didn't care about Lennon or his legacy.  It's dramatic because it's momentus.  But then they do end mostly with Chapman.Jonas Ball plays Chapman, and he becomes as fragile and as insecure as we might expect him to be.  As he narrates, we get a chilling reading of Chapman's thoughts.  I obtained most of these accounts from newspapers, magazines, and TV news magazine shows before.  For me, he's the best reason to see (really hear) this reenactment.  At certain points, the movie's mood even captures the banality of Chapman's life.  We get an insightful portrait of a truly conflicted man.  In a mental institution in 1977, unstable for his personal life or employment, and delusional and impulsive at best, we discover a misanthrope who eventually confessed, ""I was mr. nobody until I killed the Biggest Somebody on earth.""  From self-aggrandizement to regret, the dichotomies of this anguished man are sadly pathetic, but clearly presented.Personal Reflections:  I'm being self-indulgent, but you may agree with me.  As a freshman in college, John Lennon's murder hit me like a ton of bricks.  I was facing my first college exams and concentration was difficult at best.  I saw `Ordinary People' on Christmas Day, the biggest tear-jerker in my life.  It is no surprise that initially Chapman turned around and headed back to Hawaii after seeing this film.  The power of my favorite movie doesn't surprise me, but I wish it had sustained him.  Grief took me measurably in December of 1980.  Where were you when John Lennon got shot?Electrified by `The Catcher in the Rye,' Chapman used the twisted justifying context of Holden Caulfield to conclude, ""The phony must die.""  All this because of the brilliant man who wrote and sang about ""no possessions"" had plenty himself.  Besides some real estate, to paraphrase Roy Carr, he gave his money away almost ""recklessly"".  We need idealists to set the high bar in life.  Did Shakespeare live a life up to his sage writings?  Does anybody?  Even phonies don't deserve the death penalty.  Lennon, so known for his gut-felt honesty and confessional songs ""Help!,"" ""Love,"" ""I'm a Loser,"" and ""Jealous Guy"" was gunned down.  I may be beating my head against a wall grappling with Chapman's rationale, but they only demonstrate how we're still processing the repercussions of his assassination even today.  It's like trying to make sense of senselessness.  At least the movie makes an admirable attempt.",4,Making Sense of the Senseless,1217980800,"08 6, 2008",2008,3903,"['went', 'Killing', 'John', 'Lennon', 'wanting', 'be', 'illuminated', 'reenactment', 'rather', 'documentary', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'remembered', 'Lennon', 'assassin', 'Mark', 'David', 'Chapman', 'Looking', 'feeling', 'many', 'fictionalized', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'lurid', 'account', 'great', 'deal', 'authenticity', 'watching', 'film', 'felt', 'had', 'walked', 'Chapman', 'shoes', 'least', 'followed', 'footsteps', ""'m"", 'loss', 'state', ""'m"", 'better', 'off', 'having', 'taken', 'walk.For', 'stylistic', 'techniques', 'movie', 'edited', 'fastidious', 'finesse', 'get', 'breaking', 'edge', 'fast-forward', 'slow', 'motion', 'artistic', 'ensemble', 'framing', 'Writer/director', 'Andrew', 'Peddington', 'spent', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'care', 'film', 'editor', 'Tony', 'Palmer', 'should', 'get', 'semi-prestigious', 'prize', 'outstanding', 'work', 'beginning', 'get', 'horrible', 'tragedy', 'then', 'back', 'up', 'again', 'retrace', 'Chapman', 'life', 'made', 'fateful', 'decision', 'Interspersed', 'see', 'shooting', 'again', 'then', 'again', 'movie', 'forward', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'Many', 'times', 'show', 'collage', 'split-second', 'John', 'Lennon', 'frantically', 'flipped', 'screen', 'was', 'wondering', 'Are', 'going', 'suspense', 'appreciation', 'Wisely', 'part', 'last', 'thirty-five', 'minutes', 'so', 'give', 'plenty', 'old', 'news', 'reels', 'help', 'grieve', 'once', 'more', 'may', 'actually', 'be', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'say', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Lennon', 'legacy', 'dramatic', 'momentus', 'then', 'do', 'end', 'mostly', 'Chapman.Jonas', 'Ball', 'Chapman', 'fragile', 'as', 'insecure', 'might', 'expect', 'be', 'get', 'chilling', 'reading', 'Chapman', 'thoughts', 'obtained', 'most', 'accounts', 'newspapers', 'magazines', 'TV', 'news', 'magazine', 'best', 'reason', 'see', 'really', 'hear', 'reenactment', 'certain', 'points', 'movie', 'mood', 'even', 'banality', 'Chapman', 'life', 'get', 'insightful', 'portrait', 'truly', 'conflicted', 'man', 'mental', 'institution', '1977', 'unstable', 'personal', 'life', 'employment', 'delusional', 'impulsive', 'best', 'discover', 'misanthrope', 'who', 'eventually', 'confessed', 'was', 'mr.', 'nobody', 'killed', 'Biggest', 'Somebody', 'earth', 'self-aggrandizement', 'regret', 'dichotomies', 'anguished', 'man', 'are', 'sadly', 'pathetic', 'clearly', 'presented.Personal', 'Reflections', ""'m"", 'being', 'self-indulgent', 'may', 'agree', 'freshman', 'college', 'John', 'Lennon', 'murder', 'hit', 'ton', 'bricks', 'was', 'facing', 'first', 'college', 'exams', 'concentration', 'was', 'difficult', 'best', 'saw', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'biggest', 'tear-jerker', 'life', 'surprise', 'initially', 'Chapman', 'turned', 'around', 'headed', 'back', 'Hawaii', 'seeing', 'film', 'power', 'favorite', 'movie', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'wish', 'had', 'sustained', 'Grief', 'took', 'measurably', 'December', '1980', 'Where', 'were', 'when', 'John', 'Lennon', 'got', 'shot', 'Electrified', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'Chapman', 'used', 'twisted', 'justifying', 'context', 'Holden', 'Caulfield', 'conclude', 'phony', 'must', 'die', 'brilliant', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'sang', 'possessions', 'had', 'plenty', 'real', 'estate', 'paraphrase', 'Roy', 'Carr', 'gave', 'money', 'away', 'almost', 'recklessly', 'need', 'idealists', 'set', 'high', 'bar', 'life', 'Did', 'Shakespeare', 'live', 'life', 'up', 'sage', 'writings', 'anybody', 'Even', 'phonies', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'death', 'penalty', 'Lennon', 'so', 'known', 'gut-felt', 'honesty', 'confessional', 'songs', 'Help', 'Love', ""'m"", 'Loser', 'Jealous', 'Guy', 'was', 'gunned', 'down', 'may', 'be', 'beating', 'head', 'wall', 'grappling', 'Chapman', 'rationale', 'only', 'demonstrate', 'how', ""'re"", 'still', 'processing', 'repercussions', 'assassination', 'even', 'today', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'senselessness', 'least', 'movie', 'admirable', 'attempt']",The Killing of John Lennon
1160669,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B0018PH3K6,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[4, 4]","Deeply informative dramatization of Beatles' John Lennon murderer Mark David Chapman from his start in Hawaii to his incarceration in New York. Newcomer Jonas Ball plays Chapman without going too far over the edge, though at times people who are familiar with the appearance of Chapman would wonder why they picked an actor who is at least thirty pounds less than the real McCoy. But what really got me about this film is it was written with Chapman's own words through police interviews and private memoirs. But when the filmakers decided to use the actual locations that where Chapman and Lennon walked twenty-five years earlier, they didn't account for the backgrounds would now be totally different, and a sharp eye will notice a 70's-make cab for instance driving by the 2006 ABC Network's JumboTron and it's newly lit-up Times Square. Even though these may take you out of the movie, it's the dark and insane words of Chapman that will keep you in. In fact, it's so detailed that the actual assassination doesn't take place till an hour and ten minutes into the movie, and yes, it's extremely hard to watch, even 25 years later.I'd like to comment that I personally feel that as a society, we shouldn't turn these types of killers of famous people into stars themselves, forever attaching them to the person who truly earned that fame to begin with. But that is the nature of the beast.

And hey, why didn't the Honolulu Scientology Center involve the cops when he was harassing them with death threats just 4 months before he shot Lennon? That would have at least initiated some sort of paper trail. Was it the mother who raised her son as a `best friend' (i.e. couldn't care less about him) instead of son? Perhaps a father who couldn't be bothered unless it was to push his face into a plate of spaghetti?Look, I place most of the blame on the wife. She knew what her husband was up to, knew he was flying to NYC to kill John Lennon but never told anyone even though she knew he had a gun and stayed up all night listening to Beatles albums plotting against John, going on tirades about what a phony he was for owning prize Holstein cows. I would have had him reading 'Catcher in the Rye' in the state hospital quicker than you could say `annulment'.I could go on and on but why?

Of course, as a viewer, you know the forthcoming tragedy in the finale, and the film abets suspense by reminding you occasionally how many days or hours left before the murder. You find yourself meditating upon every turn of Chapman's mind, but in the end you realize nothing could save Lennon from this determined psycho. You witness all his weak, ludicrous motives, and don't expect that you'll feel any sympathy for him.

Right down to a very realistic depiction of how police officers related to Chapman and the way they handled his protetion against angry Lennon fans, While at the same time the film should be considered a travesty on one hand for immortalizing the demented human being Chapman was by making this film, the movie also offers a very heart touching memorial to John Lennon that made me want to cry. This film moved me deeply for numerous reasons, but the main one is that I actually knew a man back in the 1980's who's personality was exactly like Chapman's as it is presented in this film. The guy I knew was just as strange, and I avoided him like the plague once his real nature came out. The man freightened me. Weeks later he tortured and murdereed three helpless girls while he was working as a security guard at a San Jose Winery. His name was David Allen Railey. He now still sits on California 's death row. This movie is extremely realistic and very well produced, acted and directed. It's use of 70's iconic films such as Ordinary People, Klute, and Chapman's own references to Taxi Driver and Apocalypse now, which he uttered lines from only added to the authenticity of the film. To me this is every bit as well done and as reviting as Scorsese's Taxi Driver. and it's an important film in that it helps us understand what is going on in the minds of sadistic killers like Chapman.

1160677,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0018PH3K6,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","""The Killing of John Lennon"" takes us into the mind of a cold-blooded assassin.  I speak, of course, of Mark David Chapman, the mentally disturbed 25-year-old who shot down the former Beatle in front of his apartment in the Dakota building on December 8, 1980.  The movie achieves its goal by restricting itself pretty much to Chapman's actual words, which flow forth mainly in the form of voiceover narration, as he comments on his thoughts and deeds.We're first introduced to Chapman in September of that year as a moody, darkly introspective near-loner (he was married at the time) living in Hawaii, who calls people he doesn't know with threatening messages, and becomes so obsessed with ""The Catcher in the Rye"" that he begins to fancy himself another Holden Caulfield, i.e., a uniquely insightful observer and commentator on people and life whom no one else seems to understand.  We learn of his being raised in a loveless family by self-absorbed and disinterested parents, where emotions and physical affection were seen as inappropriate and to be avoided at all costs.  We see how he first begins to focus on Lennon as the representation of all that's wrong with the world and his own life, viewing the singer/songwriter as a hypocrite and a sell-out for preaching the gospel of love-over-materialism in his music (""Imagine no possessions..."") while living the lavish lifestyle of the rich and famous himself.  Like Holden, Chapman came to see himself as on a mission to expose and bring down the ""phonies,"" and Lennon was the one he alit upon.We then follow Chapman to New York City, where he methodically closes his trap, carefully following in Holden's footsteps all along the way (for instance, Chapman stays at the Waldorf-Astoria and orders up a hooker simply because Holden does those things in the novel).  Chapman comes to see himself as fulfilling Holden's quest to ""kill the fat man in the hotel"" - only Chapman will take that act out of the realm of fiction and fantasy and make it a reality.Written and directed by Andrew Piddington, the movie, which has been shot largely at the actual locales, provides both a chillingly detached portrait of a man who was a self-described ""nobody"" until he ""killed the biggest somebody on earth,"" and an unsensationalized account of his actions before, during and after the murder.  Jonas Ball, who is on screen virtually 100% of the time in this film, effectively captures the loser-like nature of what is essentially a nondescript pipsqueak with delusions of grandeur who's determined to make himself noticed by a world that's paid little or no heed to him up to this point.It is probably impossible for anyone to successfully get into a mind as warped and twisted as Chapman`s.

1160678,A5TZXWU8AALIC,B0018PH3K6,The JuRK,"[1, 1]","While the film CHAPTER 27 was in production, there was a tremendous outcry that a movie was being made about John Lennon's demented killer, Mark David Chapman.  I don't really remember why.  I think there were arguments that any attempt to give Chapman the celebrity he felt he deserved would be realized with a film about Lennon's death.I haven't seen CHAPTER 27 but the reviews aren't good.  I'll probably see it though, just to compare to THE KILLING OF JOHN LENNON.  (Both films came out the same year, similar to the CAPOTE/INFAMOUS and TOMBSTONE/WYATT EARP films).But I doubt if anyone can watch THE KILLING OF JOHN LENNON and come away thinking that Mark David Chapman is anything but the crazy ""killer nerd"" who should be locked away for the rest of his life (credit author Albert Goldman for labeling him a ""killer nerd"").The film opens with the announcement that all of the words belong to Chapman himself.  I find that totally believable.  Chapman's descent into madness leading up to the murder is as sad as it is fascinating.  Scraping by with a goofy mother and a hapless wife, Chapman spirals into his craziness by first stumbling on to ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" so identifying with its disenfranchised narrator that he sees the book as holy, and then stoking a furious hatred for John Lennon for ""betraying"" his fans.  ""The guy who sang that 'imagine no possessions' had millions and millions...making him a phony.""The film also feels authentic from the actual locations where everything took place.  I stopped by the Dakota on my first visit to NYC and it really made a difference watching this film.There isn't a false moment in this honest yet stylized film.  It felt like a documentary about a very sick, twisted mind and how it single-handedly changed music history.Check it out.",4,Chapman's Own Words in the Actual Locations,1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,1800,"['film', 'CHAPTER', '27', 'was', 'production', 'was', 'tremendous', 'outcry', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'John', 'Lennon', 'demented', 'killer', 'Mark', 'David', 'Chapman', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'why', 'think', 'were', 'arguments', 'attempt', 'give', 'Chapman', 'celebrity', 'felt', 'deserved', 'would', 'be', 'realized', 'film', 'Lennon', 'death.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'CHAPTER', '27', 'reviews', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'see', 'just', 'compare', 'THE', 'KILLING', 'OF', 'JOHN', 'LENNON', 'films', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'year', 'similar', 'CAPOTE/INFAMOUS', 'TOMBSTONE/WYATT', 'EARP', 'films', '.But', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'can', 'watch', 'THE', 'KILLING', 'OF', 'JOHN', 'LENNON', 'come', 'away', 'thinking', 'Mark', 'David', 'Chapman', 'anything', 'crazy', 'killer', 'nerd', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'locked', 'away', 'rest', 'life', 'credit', 'author', 'Albert', 'Goldman', 'labeling', 'killer', 'nerd', '.The', 'film', 'announcement', 'words', 'belong', 'Chapman', 'find', 'totally', 'believable', 'Chapman', 'descent', 'madness', 'leading', 'up', 'murder', 'as', 'sad', 'fascinating', 'Scraping', 'goofy', 'mother', 'hapless', 'wife', 'Chapman', 'craziness', 'first', 'stumbling', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'identifying', 'disenfranchised', 'narrator', 'book', 'holy', 'then', 'stoking', 'furious', 'hatred', 'John', 'Lennon', 'betraying', 'fans', 'guy', 'who', 'sang', 'possessions', 'had', 'millions', 'millions', 'making', 'phony', 'film', 'also', 'authentic', 'actual', 'locations', 'where', 'everything', 'took', 'place', 'stopped', 'Dakota', 'first', 'visit', 'NYC', 'really', 'made', 'difference', 'watching', 'film.There', ""n't"", 'false', 'moment', 'honest', 'yet', 'stylized', 'film', 'felt', 'documentary', 'very', 'sick', 'twisted', 'mind', 'how', 'single-handedly', 'changed', 'music', 'history.Check', 'out']",The Killing of John Lennon
