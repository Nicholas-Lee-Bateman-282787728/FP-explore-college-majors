They don't feel this achieved the promise of the first season. I really do not see any difference between the two seasons. So I like season one less but season two more than METACRITIC.

1634544,AHN86VFJIJ2JP,B00BGI05Y6,Chicago Book Addict,"[12, 20]","To preface this review, I loved the first season of Girls and own it on DVD.  I'm glad I bought it because for me, many of the episodes continue to be enjoyable to watch even after the second or third viewing.  I'm not sure I'm feeling the same way about the second season, to me it kind of felt like it hit a sophomore slump.  For starters, in the second season it felt like they were trying too hard to push the boundaries and make the characters and the story lines.  I realize that often gives a show more critical acclaim, but for me it negatively impacted my enjoyment of the show.  For starters, it meant that some of the characters felt a lot less relatable since they were being put in situations that aren't necessarily as universal among twenty-somethings.  It also made for some very cringeworthy moments were I was almost tempted to fast forward through the episode or simply skip to the next one.  To me this makes the show less worthy of purchasing because many of the episodes I have no desire to see a second or a third time, unlike how I felt about the first season.  And in general (and like much of my criticism this is highly subjective) the self-centered actions and lack of self-awareness of the main characters just wasn't as funny this season.  Last season I didn't mind these qualities in the characters because it often made for good laughs.  This season with the exception of Marnie's vocal stylings (which I think was perfect acting on her part as well as the extras in the scene) I wasn't feeling it that much.  I'm not sure if it was because the writing or acting was off or whether the personalities of these characters become grating quickly.Overall, (and I never thought I would say this after I gushed over the first season) there didn't seem to be as much to love.  I think if you enjoyed the first season it's certainly worth watching once, but I'm not sure it's something I want to own and watch more than once.",2,Sophomore Slump?,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,1949,"['preface', 'review', 'loved', 'first', 'season', 'Girls', 'own', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'glad', 'bought', 'many', 'episodes', 'continue', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'even', 'second', 'third', 'viewing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'same', 'way', 'second', 'season', 'kind', 'felt', 'hit', 'sophomore', 'slump', 'starters', 'second', 'season', 'felt', 'were', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'push', 'boundaries', 'make', 'characters', 'story', 'lines', 'realize', 'often', 'show', 'more', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'negatively', 'impacted', 'enjoyment', 'show', 'starters', 'meant', 'characters', 'felt', 'lot', 'less', 'relatable', 'were', 'being', 'put', 'situations', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'universal', 'twenty-somethings', 'also', 'made', 'very', 'cringeworthy', 'moments', 'were', 'was', 'almost', 'tempted', 'fast', 'forward', 'episode', 'simply', 'skip', 'next', 'one', 'show', 'less', 'worthy', 'purchasing', 'many', 'episodes', 'have', 'desire', 'see', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'how', 'felt', 'first', 'season', 'general', 'much', 'criticism', 'highly', 'subjective', 'self-centered', 'actions', 'lack', 'self-awareness', 'main', 'characters', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'season', 'Last', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'qualities', 'characters', 'often', 'made', 'good', 'laughs', 'season', 'exception', 'Marnie', 'vocal', 'stylings', 'think', 'was', 'perfect', 'acting', 'part', 'as', 'well', 'extras', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'feeling', 'much', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'writing', 'acting', 'was', 'off', 'personalities', 'characters', 'become', 'grating', 'quickly.Overall', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'say', 'gushed', 'first', 'season', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'something', 'want', 'own', 'watch', 'more', 'once']",Girls: Season 2
1634545,A234PK90SOCFSF,B00BGI05Y6,Christopher Beckwith,"[0, 0]","I found the first season charming, funny and  wickedly offbeat. The second season offers more of this, but then, in later episodes, starts to veer towards something much darker as the principal characters grapple with core uncertainties and anxieties in their lives, and not always successfully - anything but in some instances. Honestly, it's painful to watch at times because we care about these characters. But that's what makes the show so rewarding. It may be a comedy series, however, its general tone overall seems to be approaching a fugue state. I'm not sure I've seen anything like this before, but I find it intriguing. And I trust Denham's instincts as to where she wants to take the show. She's doing some remarkable work. And Zosia Mamet absolutely cracks me up.

A couple weeks ago, when HBO had a freeview, when it was the debut of season 3 - I watched both those episodes, plus the older episodes they were showing - I saw like 7 episodes in one night.  I became a fan of Lena when I was watching the Golden Globes and she won those awards a year or two back.  I seriously have no idea why - I just thought she was cute, had the tatts - and I just instantly liked her....she's down to earth.  Just got that vibe in the first 5 seconds I saw her.  That said - I remember the first episode I watched...2 weeks ago.  My first Stephen King novel was Gerald's Game, the first Seinfeld episode I saw was the one where they lost the car in the parking garage and Elaine's fish died....Girls?  It was the one where she went up to that guy about the garbage or whatever and stayed at his place and they kept having sex - and she was naked a lot (thank you Lena)  But I liked that episode - it was weird.  Then I just kept watching the other episodes and the new ones.  That all said boils down to this - Lena is a cutie and very smart, the show is realistic, depressing, and I like that..because the world is depressing.  I hate shows that are fake and make the world seem so great.  Lena tells it like it is, and I respect that.  Shows humanity, blemishes and all.

There are a few good episodes (Hannah trying cocaine, Hannah hooking up with a guy twice her age), but other than that, it was all kind of lame. My biggest issues have to do with Lena Dunham's obsession with her own nakedness. Yes, we get that you are comfortable in your plus-size body...good for you. But Hannah gets naked on this show ALL THE TIME, so much so that it starts to take away from the rest of the plot. Cover yourself, already! And I also thought Hannah became more annoying than ever by the end of the season, and I'm not liking the whole OCD storyline for her character. Also, with the exception of Jessa, I really started hating on the other main characters even more than before this season. Shoshanna is so annoying in every possible way, and Marnie is so self-absorbed and nasty. (I wasn't happy with what happened between her and Charlie in the final episode...I hope she gets what she deserves in Season 3.)

The main character is whiney unattractive and is the only one who shows her naked body.,1,chick series,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,413,"['horrible', 'series', 'main', 'character', 'debasing', 'getting', 'naked', 'having', 'sex', 'man', 'interest', 'feelings', 'whatsoever', 'friends', 'are', 'same', 'best', 'friend', 'interest', 'feelings', 'may', 'get', 'women', 'angry', 'nothing', 'interest', 'straight', 'man', 'main', 'character', 'whiney', 'unattractive', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'naked', 'body']",Girls: Season 2

I'm not sure exactly what Lena Dunham was trying to accomplish, so maybe she achieved exactly what she wanted. I found the show depressing, and faintly nauseating. Maybe that's the ""real life"" coming through. Whatever Lena's intention, I found the Hannah character the most infuriating. Maybe that is because she reminds me of my own daughter. The constant dodge of responsibility, and the incessant escalation of ""making it about her"" as a self-sabotaging diversion the more she was faced with actually doing something substantive.Regarding Lena's nudity: Nudity is all well and good, but she reminds me of the Pillsbury doughboy. I don't enjoy looking at it, but whatever, that's her body. What bothered me more was her writing herself into sex scenes where hunky guys find her beautiful. She had her cute moments, and maybe some guys would find that beautiful, but *ALL* of them?Speaking of the guys, Adam was by far the most original and interesting character. Maybe most ""real life"" people are boring, and so the characters also had to be? I wish the script had explored and developed the Jessa character in more depth. It was more complex than the other girls'. The ""her father"" episode attempted this, with limited success.The fact I that I have this much to say about the show indicates it was art, even if the kind that makes you uncomfortable to witness.

In 20 episodes I watched Hannah sleep with at least 6 different guys. I don't see how showing graphic sex scenes in every episode is instrumental to the plot.  Lacking any passion or emotion, the scenes are ridiculous and awful to watch. The characters on the show are not very likeable.  Hannah and Jessa have moments when you could possibly care what happens to them, which is the reason I watched both seasons.  As for the other characters, forget them.  Marnie is so selfish, I truly wish bad things for her.  Shoshanna is just plain annoying.  It's like she never left middle school.

Adam becomes more than an awful hipster parody. Even Shoshana gets out of her weird space by actually stating what was wrong with her boyfriend.Still, there is a great deal of awfulness in this season that it's hard to forgive. I am not sure if the first season was actually better or if I had just not gotten sick of the characters by that point, but there is a serious nosedive into self-involved horribleness in this season. The Danny Glover storyline from the first two episodes almost seems like a Mission Statement to shove in the face of everyone who thought that the show was just Brooklyn white people.

And Marnie's boyfriend Charlie: Wasn't he unemployed last season? Now he's phone app millionaire? And Adam's beautiful, sophisticated new girlfriend who seems entirely normal: Would someone like that really allow her recovering alcoholic mother to fix her up with a guy she meets after his outburst at an AA meeting?
