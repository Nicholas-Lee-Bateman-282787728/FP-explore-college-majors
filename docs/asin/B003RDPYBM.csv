Magdaleno ""Bibliophile""","[6, 11]","Let me start off by saying that if you are a fan of Haruhi, you should support the releases and buy this box set.Here's why:Endless Eight is a very good concept that was executed perfectly. I am no fan boy, or otaku, and I am not just trying to trick you into buying this set. Endless Eight consists of the same story line drawn in 8 different episodes, giving a fresh perspective every time you advance an episode.I found myself intrigued with Endless Eight because it is the only way to offer the viewer the feeling of being trapped in a never ending cycle. It adds much depth and was a bold and creative move.I am sure that most viewers who are already fans of Haruhi will find Endless Eight enjoyable.Do not listen to these jaded hardcore otaku, who, in my humble opinion, demand way too much!Don't let their words deceive you. They are angry because Kyoto Animation did not cater to their personal needs(go figure). Don't go into watching the series thinking, ""Okay i'm ready for endless eight, everyone said this sucked so i'm just gonna watch it(with a closed mind) and skip to the next episode.""If you like unique, innovative anime, then you already know why you watch Haruhi to begin with!This season is not as good as the first but it is definitely worth buying!The first episode, ""Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody,"" is such a trippy episode that I had to re-watch it to make sure I got everything!The other episodes deal with the making of the adventures of mikuru asahina, the movie. Did I mention that Bandai has thrown in an insane amount of dvd extras? I mean, not many companies do that anymore. If you want extra content, this dvd will not disappoint!I'm not trying to pick a fight with the angry fans but they post their angry rants as reviews and therefore scare away potential fans of the second season!Even comes with a nifty CD, for people who enjoy the opening and closer songs.p.s. That price tag is expensive, I'm not gonna lie, try to find a good price. And with that, I send you on your way! Go on, get'!",5,Do not let Endless Eight haters deter you from this box set!,1285113600,"09 22, 2010",2010,2019,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'are', 'fan', 'Haruhi', 'should', 'support', 'releases', 'buy', 'box', 'why', 'Endless', 'Eight', 'very', 'good', 'concept', 'was', 'executed', 'perfectly', 'am', 'fan', 'boy', 'otaku', 'am', 'not', 'just', 'trying', 'trick', 'buying', 'set', 'Endless', 'Eight', 'consists', 'same', 'story', 'line', 'drawn', '8', 'different', 'episodes', 'giving', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'time', 'advance', 'episode.I', 'found', 'intrigued', 'Endless', 'Eight', 'only', 'way', 'offer', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'being', 'trapped', 'never', 'ending', 'cycle', 'much', 'depth', 'was', 'bold', 'creative', 'move.I', 'am', 'sure', 'most', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'fans', 'Haruhi', 'will', 'find', 'Endless', 'Eight', 'enjoyable.Do', 'not', 'listen', 'jaded', 'hardcore', 'otaku', 'who', 'humble', 'opinion', 'demand', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'words', 'deceive', 'are', 'angry', 'Kyoto', 'Animation', 'did', 'not', 'cater', 'personal', 'needs', 'go', 'figure', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'watching', 'series', 'thinking', 'Okay', 'i', ""'m"", 'ready', 'endless', 'eight', 'everyone', 'said', 'sucked', 'so', 'i', ""'m"", 'just', 'gon', 'watch', 'closed', 'mind', 'next', 'episode', 'like', 'unique', 'innovative', 'anime', 'then', 'already', 'know', 'why', 'watch', 'Haruhi', 'begin', 'season', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buying', 'first', 'episode', 'Bamboo', 'Leaf', 'Rhapsody', 'trippy', 'episode', 'had', 're-watch', 'make', 'sure', 'got', 'everything', 'other', 'episodes', 'deal', 'making', 'adventures', 'mikuru', 'asahina', 'movie', 'Did', 'mention', 'Bandai', 'thrown', 'insane', 'amount', 'dvd', 'extras', 'mean', 'not', 'many', 'companies', 'do', 'anymore', 'want', 'extra', 'content', 'dvd', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'pick', 'fight', 'angry', 'fans', 'post', 'angry', 'rants', 'reviews', 'therefore', 'scare', 'away', 'potential', 'fans', 'second', 'season', 'Even', 'nifty', 'CD', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'opening', 'closer', 'songs.p.s', 'price', 'tag', 'expensive', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'lie', 'try', 'find', 'good', 'price', 'send', 'way', 'Go', 'get']","The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Season 2"

So if you've seen the last episode of season 1 that's the end of the anime. In episode 1 of season 2 Kyon and Mikuru go back in time. Kyon helps a middle school aged Haruhi draw lines on the quad of the school.

Without giving too much info about the season it can get dark and dramatic, depending on how you will react to these scenes.What I can say is that since they are in highschool, it takes place sometime after the events of the first season so they do move up in their school years; closer to finishing school (something that happens to all of us).

1360859,A1UU6ETAY6TBRH,B003RDPYBM,Porcupine,"[6, 8]","I give the R1 release of the Haruhi season 2 DVD set a 1-star rating. The Japanese audio track is messed up and has only mono audio. Still doesn't sound too bad but a mistake like that these days is unforgivable. The video quality isn't that great either, but it is better than the video quality of the Haruhi season 1 DVDs. No interlacing problems this time around. The bitrate is still very low but at least slightly better than before. The subtitle fonts have changed to match other recent releases.I give the show itself 3-stars for season 2. A lot of people hated Endless Eight. My take on it lies in the middle. Plot-wise, the concept seems minimally acceptable, but when you actually see what they did, there is no excuse for the bad decision. Every episode is pretty much 100% identical to the others in content. I thought there might be subtle variations in each later episode, but nope. It's exactly the same each time around which is stupid. Also, the time loop didn't occur 8 times, it occurred 15000+ times, so there's no innate reason to make 8 identical episodes.Animation-wise though, Endless Eight is fine. There are absolutely no rehashed visuals, they drew 8 completely different versions of the same episode. Everyone wears different clothes in each version, and all the scenes and shots are completely different too. They just say and do the exact same things each time. In terms of production value, Endless Eight isn't a rip-off. Still, the overall animation quality of season 2 isn't as high as season 1. Endless Eight needed the 3-minute beach scene in each episode to be longer, at least then there would be a point to watching eight versions of the same thing.The remaining six episodes are fairly boring, which doesn't help either. The only interesting events in Haruhi season 2 are the few times when Tsuruya or the BB guns are on-screen.

It had something for everyone, this is like the only anime that literally made me laugh out loud, and on top of that it had amazing action sequences and storyline. Season 2 is putting it VERY lightly ridiculous. It's like if somebody had a time machine and used it just to destroy every good feeling you have ever had in the past. The endless 8 is the WORST way to start a new season. I kept picking up and leaving it from 5 to 8 for the span of a month. By the time I got to the end of the 8 I just dropped all expectations from the rest of the season. Then the other part of the season just destroys the feelings that were built up of Haruhi being this innocent cute girl in the first season, and turn her into a complete b$#$h. This season brings NOTHING to the table, the only interesting part of the season was when mikuru got the power to shoot things with her eye, and even that is excess unneeded information. This season is not worth 50$, i wouldn't even begin to think about it unless it was close to 10$-15$.Haruhi is still an interesting and fun anime, just disregard this season, and go watch the movie, hell the movie had a MUCH better story arc than this season.",1,"DO NOT BOTHER WITH SEASON 2, JUST WATCH THE MOVIE!!!",1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,1218,"['just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'season', '1', 'was', 'great', 'had', 'something', 'everyone', 'only', 'anime', 'literally', 'made', 'loud', 'top', 'had', 'amazing', 'action', 'sequences', 'storyline', 'Season', '2', 'putting', 'VERY', 'lightly', 'somebody', 'had', 'time', 'machine', 'used', 'just', 'destroy', 'good', 'feeling', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'past', 'endless', '8', 'WORST', 'way', 'start', 'new', 'season', 'kept', 'picking', 'up', 'leaving', '5', '8', 'span', 'month', 'time', 'got', 'end', '8', 'just', 'dropped', 'expectations', 'rest', 'season', 'Then', 'other', 'part', 'season', 'just', 'feelings', 'were', 'built', 'Haruhi', 'being', 'innocent', 'cute', 'girl', 'first', 'season', 'turn', 'complete', 'b', 'h', 'season', 'NOTHING', 'table', 'only', 'interesting', 'part', 'season', 'was', 'when', 'mikuru', 'got', 'power', 'shoot', 'things', 'eye', 'even', 'excess', 'unneeded', 'information', 'season', 'not', 'worth', '50', 'i', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'think', 'was', 'close', '10', '-15', '.Haruhi', 'still', 'interesting', 'fun', 'anime', 'just', 'disregard', 'season', 'go', 'watch', 'movie', 'hell', 'movie', 'had', 'MUCH', 'better', 'story', 'arc', 'season']","The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Season 2"

The first tightly weaved and ""majestic"" episode neatly tied together many moments out of the first season. All in ONE episode! The ones following the abominable ""endless eight"" did as well, but sadly. That meant the story really never went forward narratively. The company pushed it further with a movie after the second season, but by the end of it.

This show is such a blast to watch, but as I had written I was quite surprised how a show with such originality came to a screeching halt with so many unanswered questions. Well here we have season 2! The funny thing I have to say about season two is that it it's not really an official second season yet it does `fill in the gaps' so to speak.This season takes place in different intervals between the original 14 episodes and that is something that I have grown to love in storytelling. It's very similar to Batman: Under The Red Hood. While giving us an entire epilogue this piece of the story gives us a few gap fillers that turn the original story of Death in the Family into a much deeper story it other pawns in play. So Haruhi does the exact same thing. Now I just want to say that you need to brace yourself for a spoiler alert. This season features the Episodes known as `The Endless 8' Yes you are pretty much going to see the same episode eight times with a few small differences, but it is probably one of the most original ideas to keep a story going and the best part is it will take you a little bit of time trying to figure out why it is happening.While this season was just as entertaining I am still trying to find out where it is going. If you watch all the episodes in order you are still left with a few more of the same questions. Still, the major question I had was answered and that is that the crazy adventures of the S.O.S.
