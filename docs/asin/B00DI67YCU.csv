When the fronts blow in, I don't like subtitles because it is hard to read with one hand scratching and rubbing at your eye.  Aside from that it was an alright movie.  It is brutal but the pacing and acting wasn't bad and there is quite a bit of gore.  I would have liked it better if the director had spent less time on the prostitution job and spitting once she was done with her job but the viewer got idea of what was going on.  The story is about three siblings who run from their drug dealing father and end up in one unfavorable situation after another.  The gore does reflect the savage brutal story of the siblings as well as the rough characters and terrain the story takes place in.

1655706,ACW4P33TPKDWW,B00DI67YCU,Drew from Oregon,"[21, 24]","I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of this DVD for review.  This review may contain some spoilers.  Here it is:Hidden in the Woods is a film that is based on true events, though this is extremely hard to believe given the gruesome content and nature of the film throughout.  Within the interview that is included in the 8-page collectible booklet, the director claims the film is 70% accurate to the true events and the other 30% is his own vision.  Regardless, Hidden in the Woods will keep you at the edge of your seat for the whole 98 minute run time and leave the story and some images burned in your mind forever.The movie follows a couple of sisters and their brother who had escaped from their father, Felipe, who was a drug dealer.  Throughout the years, Felipe had abused the girls and brother and subjected them to monstrous atrocities that you only read about in books.  Their brother, Manuel, is deformed and had only been fed an all meat diet while he was locked in a shed.  After escaping from their father, the girls and their brother all go to a cabin deep within the woods where Felipe used to keep his drugs.  It is in this cabin the viewer is treated to a scene where the family cannibalizes a couple of hikers, who were up to no good, after they tried to attack one of the women.  We see dismemberment, blood, gore, guts, and just about everything you can imagine.  The special effects in this part of the film were very well done and made the scene seen believable.A man named, Costello, is the leader of a drug gang and he wants Felipe's drugs, so he decides to get other members of his gang to find the girls and torture them until they reveal where the drugs are hidden.  Some members of the drug gang finally find the cabin with the girls in it and start to torture them asking where the drugs are; however, they have no clue.  After some more blood flies, the girls and Manuel manage to escape into the woods.  The remaining two members of the drug gang go out to find them and kill them.  This chase sequence is very well done and so intense, it had the palms of my hands sweating and hoping the girls would get away.  Eventually, we are brought to the very final scene of the movie.  The final scene is so disturbing and so bloody, at times, I had to look away.  I kept telling myself, ""It's only special effects."", but it was so well done, it almost seemed like reality.I don't want to reveal too much of this movie in this review, hence, why I'm a bit vague on a few things because there are a couple of twists in the story at the end.  Overall, this movie was sick, disgusting, gory, and extremely bloody, but I liked it.  It was very well done and the story line was very believable, obviously, because it was mostly true.  Hidden in the Woods is a movie that I recommend almost any Horror fan to watch as it's a story of survival and revenge at its most extreme.  Overall, I give Hidden in the Woods a 5/5 stars.  It's definitely worth buying and keeping in your collection as you may want to watch it multiple times.Overall rating:  5/5 starsSpecial Features:Interview with Director Patricio Valladares8-Page Collectible BookletBehind the Scenes FeaturetteArtsploitation Trailers",5,"Disturbing, but Overall a Great Movie",1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,3219,"['was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'receive', 'copy', 'DVD', 'review', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Here', 'Hidden', 'Woods', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'extremely', 'hard', 'believe', 'given', 'gruesome', 'content', 'nature', 'film', 'interview', 'included', '8-page', 'collectible', 'booklet', 'director', 'film', '70', '%', 'accurate', 'true', 'events', 'other', '30', '%', 'own', 'vision', 'Regardless', 'Hidden', 'Woods', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'whole', '98', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'leave', 'story', 'images', 'burned', 'mind', 'forever.The', 'movie', 'couple', 'sisters', 'brother', 'who', 'had', 'escaped', 'father', 'Felipe', 'who', 'was', 'drug', 'dealer', 'years', 'Felipe', 'had', 'abused', 'girls', 'brother', 'subjected', 'monstrous', 'atrocities', 'only', 'read', 'books', 'brother', 'Manuel', 'deformed', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'fed', 'meat', 'diet', 'was', 'locked', 'shed', 'escaping', 'father', 'girls', 'brother', 'go', 'cabin', 'deep', 'woods', 'where', 'Felipe', 'used', 'keep', 'drugs', 'cabin', 'viewer', 'treated', 'scene', 'where', 'family', 'couple', 'hikers', 'who', 'were', 'up', 'good', 'tried', 'attack', 'one', 'women', 'see', 'dismemberment', 'blood', 'gore', 'guts', 'just', 'everything', 'can', 'imagine', 'special', 'effects', 'part', 'film', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'made', 'scene', 'seen', 'believable.A', 'man', 'named', 'Costello', 'leader', 'drug', 'gang', 'Felipe', 'drugs', 'get', 'other', 'members', 'gang', 'find', 'girls', 'torture', 'reveal', 'where', 'drugs', 'are', 'hidden', 'members', 'drug', 'gang', 'finally', 'find', 'cabin', 'girls', 'start', 'torture', 'asking', 'where', 'drugs', 'are', 'however', 'have', 'clue', 'more', 'blood', 'flies', 'girls', 'Manuel', 'manage', 'escape', 'woods', 'remaining', 'two', 'members', 'drug', 'gang', 'go', 'out', 'find', 'kill', 'chase', 'sequence', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'so', 'intense', 'had', 'palms', 'hands', 'sweating', 'hoping', 'girls', 'would', 'get', 'away', 'Eventually', 'are', 'brought', 'very', 'final', 'scene', 'movie', 'final', 'scene', 'so', 'disturbing', 'so', 'bloody', 'times', 'had', 'look', 'away', 'kept', 'telling', 'only', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'almost', 'seemed', 'reality.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'review', 'hence', 'why', ""'m"", 'bit', 'vague', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'couple', 'twists', 'story', 'end', 'Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'sick', 'disgusting', 'gory', 'extremely', 'bloody', 'liked', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'obviously', 'was', 'mostly', 'true', 'Hidden', 'Woods', 'movie', 'recommend', 'almost', 'Horror', 'fan', 'watch', 'story', 'survival', 'revenge', 'most', 'extreme', 'Overall', 'give', 'Hidden', 'Woods', '5/5', 'stars', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buying', 'keeping', 'collection', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'multiple', 'times.Overall', 'rating', '5/5', 'starsSpecial', 'Features', 'Interview', 'Director', 'Patricio', 'Valladares8-Page', 'Collectible', 'Scenes', 'FeaturetteArtsploitation', 'Trailers']",Hidden in the Woods
1655707,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00DI67YCU,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[3, 7]","One of the central problems in reviewing films so heavily steeped in traditional exploitation themes is that - at their core - there's very little redeeming quality to them.  Essentially, what one can say all films of this nature share is the desire to have one's revenge - it isn't about having one's cake and eating it but rather it's about being totally bent out of shape that whoever was baking the cake obviously ruined it.  Now, it's time that flawed baker pay the piper.  Otherwise, the images are swathed in the requisite amount of blood, anger, and any other human depravity that's fit to be squeezed into these images.  Looking for greater meaning is a fool's paradise; believing you'll find any is the fool's gold.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Deep in the wooded countryside, Ana and Anny live with their thuggish father (a part-time drug dealer) and their deformed brother.  When their father eventually runs into trouble with the law, the children decide to take in `on the lam,' breaking out for a distant cabin with the promise for starting over.  However, fate intervenes ... along with a healthy dose of routine bloodshed, creative prostitution, and elective cannibalism.Exploitation films tend to be populated with the most unsavory characters a director, screenwriter, or storyteller one can find, and HIDDEN IN THE WOODS is certainly no different.  From the film's opening sequence when we see a man plunging his screaming wife's face into a kitchen sink filled with water while demanding the name of her secret lover, no audience member should be coming at the picture with any sense of delusion: these are bad folks - yes, the victims, too - and they're about to do something bad.  True to form, the man walks out and announces to his two young girls that ""mommy's gone to Heaven,"" and that's about as much context one might need to understand the picture's context.Still, somehow HIDDEN manages to wring out one cruel, sadistic surprise after another - our killer is not only a murderous single parent but also a drug-dealer for the worse heavy, a pedophile who's preying on the girls; our killer is also engaging in incestuous relations with his oldest girl; even more shocking, the man's raising his youngest (a deformed infant) on a diet of raw meat.  Just when you think you've seen it all, screenwriters Andrea Cavaletto and Patricio Valladares (who also directed) are all too happy to craft a scene reminding you that you haven't.  And just how bad can it get?  Well, methinks if this thing had gone on for more than 98 minutes they somehow still wouldn't have run out of material.It isn't as if HIDDEN fails in any regard.  To the contrary, it's probably the pinnacle of brutal storytelling one is likely to happen across in this modern age.  By their very definition, exploitation films are meant to elicit some strong response of their audience, be it anger, disgust, revulsion, or perhaps tragically misplaced delight in the act of discovering how much suffering one character (or a cast of them) can endure.  In that respect, I can certainly understand why the picture enjoys its controversial reputation.  But having sat through this once (I will admit that I resorted to some healthy fast-forwarding in the film's final twenty minutes when it became a bit of a slog for me personally) I'd probably not even do so again, and that's only because I found it too narrowly focused on abusing my sensibilities as a voyeur instead of legitimately delivering a story with characters worth exploring.It might help to think of this all as a Spanish telenovel ... but instead of a convention director they brought in David Lynch to reshoot Quentin Tarantino's footage ... and had the Coen Brothers rework the script.  Suffice it to say, it's super-violent and ultra-bloody.HIDDEN IN THE WOODS (2012) is produced by Vallastudio Pictures.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by Artsploitation Films.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a Spanish spoken language film with English subtitles.  As for the technical specifications?  Well, IMDB.com reports that the film's budget clocked in at around a whopping $90,000, and I don't doubt it.  In fact, that figure may be a bit high.  This was mostly shot in ridiculously absurd close-up; in some sequences, the violence happens just off-screen, and that's likely because they couldn't afford anything more than a bucket of blood to throw at the principles.  To my surprise, the release comes with a handy assortment of special features - the disc has an interview with director Valladares, some behind-the-scenes shorts, and theatrical trailers for other Artsploitation releases; furthermore, the product packaging includes a nifty little 8-page booklet that explores the production in some modest detail.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  The short answer here is that there's little reason to sit through HIDDEN IN THE WOODS except other than to satisfy one's curiosity.  It's exploitation for exploitation's sake.  There isn't anything redeeming to this story exploring perhaps the most macabre set of family values I've ever seen committed to film.  Unfortunately, too much of what story is there plays out with some honestly sub-par acting - much like the Spanish telenovels already referenced; if that's your predilection, then you might find more here to admire than I did.  Otherwise, it's all just bizarre.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Artsploitation Films provided me with a DVD copy of HIDDEN IN THE WOODS by request for the

1655708,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B00DI67YCU,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[2, 3]","Hmmm. I hope it doesn't happen often, as I only stumbled upon a few deletions by accident. Oh well.This movie doesn't fall neatly in the horror genre. Its more horrifying. than entertaining, one of those in which you feel you need a shower after watching. The acting and setting makes it seem oh so realistic. As if I were peeping in on a 'family'. There is child abuse, incest, drug trafficking, lots of violence... in a backwoods, Latin American setting. There's a horror subgenre theme here but I won't reveal it though others probably have. When I watched this there were only 2 reviews and it wasn't mentioned so it came as a surprise, as it should. This movie is a great exercise in relativism. Toward the middle, I was increasingly repelled by the protagonists, and thought ""They need to die"". But then, with the insertion of the drug cartel guys, I started rooting for them!

1655713,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00DI67YCU,Matthew Scott Baker,"[3, 5]","*I received a review copy of this film; this is an unbiased review.Part horror, part thriller, and part family drama, HIDDEN IN THE WOODS is one of those multi-genre hybrids that breaks molds and knocks down cultural barriers.  But to do so, it assails its viewers with a large does of brutality and gore.  This is certainly not a bad thing for a movie of this caliber, but what makes this more shocking than most horror flicks is that this is based on a bizarre but true story.  This film is relentless in its intensity and violence, but if you can make it through, you're in for a real treat.HIDDEN IN THE WOODS is shot well and looks very good onscreen.  But two primary components made this movie for me:  the acting and the special effects (specifically, the gore).The cast in this film is amazing.  Siboney Lo and Carolina Escobar are the two lead actresses and they do a spectacular job of conveying the agonies their characters went through in real life.  The audience relates to them very early on, and therefore feels a part of every tragedy inflicted upon them.Likewise, the gore in HIDDEN IN THE WOODS looks exceptional.  And there's plenty of it, too.  When the father goes after the two police officers with a chainsaw, I saw flashbacks to THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.  And the climactic ending is reminiscent of a Quentin Tarantino film, with a crazy kitchen shootout that would make the man himself proud.HIDDEN IN THE WOODS is a difficult film to watch in certain places because of its graphic and sensitive subject matter.  But it is a hell of a film and one I highly recommend if you can stomach through it.  Just be warned:  this one will not be for everyone.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",4,A brutal but great film,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,1731,"['*I', 'received', 'review', 'copy', 'film', 'unbiased', 'review.Part', 'horror', 'part', 'thriller', 'part', 'family', 'drama', 'HIDDEN', 'IN', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'one', 'multi-genre', 'hybrids', 'breaks', 'molds', 'knocks', 'down', 'cultural', 'barriers', 'do', 'so', 'viewers', 'large', 'brutality', 'gore', 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'movie', 'caliber', 'what', 'more', 'shocking', 'most', 'horror', 'flicks', 'based', 'bizarre', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'relentless', 'intensity', 'violence', 'can', 'make', ""'re"", 'real', 'treat.HIDDEN', 'IN', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'shot', 'well', 'very', 'good', 'onscreen', 'two', 'primary', 'components', 'made', 'movie', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'specifically', 'gore', '.The', 'cast', 'film', 'amazing', 'Siboney', 'Lo', 'Carolina', 'Escobar', 'are', 'two', 'lead', 'actresses', 'do', 'spectacular', 'job', 'conveying', 'agonies', 'characters', 'went', 'real', 'life', 'audience', 'very', 'early', 'therefore', 'feels', 'part', 'tragedy', 'inflicted', 'them.Likewise', 'gore', 'HIDDEN', 'IN', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'exceptional', 'plenty', 'too', 'When', 'father', 'two', 'police', 'officers', 'chainsaw', 'saw', 'flashbacks', 'THE', 'TEXAS', 'CHAINSAW', 'MASSACRE', 'climactic', 'ending', 'reminiscent', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'film', 'crazy', 'kitchen', 'shootout', 'would', 'make', 'man', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'certain', 'places', 'graphic', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'matter', 'hell', 'film', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend', 'can', 'stomach', 'Just', 'be', 'warned', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'film', 'available', 'now', 'variety', 'formats']",Hidden in the Woods

Anyways, this movie is pretty messed up since the story follows a horrible drug dealer father that drinks and rapes his own daughters in some dirty house in the woods but if you are a thriller / horror fan and also enjoy scenes that can be hard to watch by the average hollywood movie watcher then you need to check this film out! This is one of those films that you end up watching once and possibly can't watch again due to how sick the movie can be sometimes but that does not mean I regret watching it because I am glad I saw this despite some negative reviews from movie watchers that prefer transformers or some ghost movie. Anyways, go ahead and rent this flick to see if you can handle the first 15-20 minutes because if you do, then you can finish the whole movie! So glad I rented this because I never heard anything about this film until the other day by watching the trailer on amazon and rented it as soon as I realized it was a foreign film since horror / thriller foreign films have been on a roll lately for these past several years. Also, I have to give MAJOR props to Siboney Lo and Carolina Escobar for putting on an amazing performance while doing many crazy things throughout the film since this film is not for everyone.  If you have seen the classic foreign film, ""Martyrs"" and you could handle that type of movie then you can handle ""Hidden in the Woods"" aka ""En las afueras de la ciudad""",5,Disturbing yet can't stop watching,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,1623,"['Well', 'first', 'must', 'enjoy', 'foreign', 'films', 'watching', 'are', 'subtitles', 'follow', 'understand', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movies', 'subtitles', 'are', 'too', 'lazy', 'ready', 'whatnot', 'Anyways', 'movie', 'pretty', 'messed', 'up', 'story', 'horrible', 'drug', 'dealer', 'father', 'drinks', 'rapes', 'own', 'daughters', 'dirty', 'house', 'woods', 'are', 'thriller', '/', 'horror', 'fan', 'also', 'enjoy', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'watch', 'average', 'hollywood', 'movie', 'watcher', 'then', 'need', 'check', 'film', 'out', 'one', 'films', 'end', 'up', 'watching', 'once', 'possibly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again', 'due', 'how', 'sick', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'sometimes', 'not', 'mean', 'regret', 'watching', 'am', 'glad', 'saw', 'negative', 'reviews', 'movie', 'watchers', 'prefer', 'transformers', 'ghost', 'movie', 'Anyways', 'go', 'ahead', 'rent', 'flick', 'see', 'can', 'handle', 'first', '15-20', 'minutes', 'do', 'then', 'can', 'finish', 'whole', 'movie', 'glad', 'rented', 'never', 'heard', 'anything', 'film', 'other', 'day', 'watching', 'trailer', 'amazon', 'rented', 'as', 'soon', 'realized', 'was', 'foreign', 'film', 'horror', '/', 'foreign', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'roll', 'lately', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'Also', 'have', 'give', 'MAJOR', 'props', 'Siboney', 'Lo', 'Carolina', 'Escobar', 'putting', 'amazing', 'performance', 'doing', 'many', 'crazy', 'things', 'film', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'have', 'seen', 'classic', 'foreign', 'film', 'Martyrs', 'could', 'handle', 'type', 'movie', 'then', 'can', 'handle', 'Hidden', 'Woods', 'aka', 'En', 'las', 'afueras', 'de', 'la', 'ciudad']",Hidden in the Woods
