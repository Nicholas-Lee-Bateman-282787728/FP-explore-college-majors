1491200,A2582KMXLK2P06,B005LAIISA,B. E Jackson,"[3, 5]","Ice Age: Continental Drift is basically like the other Ice Ages movies with one exception: this time the focus on adventure and excitement is much MUCH faster, uncontrollable and flat out zannier this time around.  I mean significantly crazier, haha.  I'd honestly need to watch Continental Drift about 3 more times to really be able to keep up with the many assortment of animal flips, dives, jumps, rolls, leaps, etc.  Don't get me wrong- there's a storyline present, but it's not always obvious.  Quite often you have to wait for storyline progressing segments to occur.When an iceberg separates the mammoth played by Ray Romano and leaves his wife (played by Queen Latifah) and their daughter on their own, the mammoth and saber-toothed cat accidentally go on a little iceberg adventure involving tons of oceanic creatures coming into the picture and causing hilarious chaos (especially the one with the crab and the sloth- I love this one in particular).Soon after, they make landfall and find themselves trapped against an ape who claims to be the king of the ocean so fighting against him is entirely hopeless.  Also, a female saber-toothed gray cat comes into the equation and reluctantly fights against (and eventually with) the mammoth, cat and sloth.  However in order to join in with the gang of familiar animals we all know and love, she has to separate herself from the ape whose quest is solely on destroying our loveable talkative animals... which proves to be quite a difficult decision for the cat.I'd say Continental Drift offers a ton of excitement, however the one problem is that many of the jokes fall flat.  I'm not a Nicki Minaj fan so her presence is pretty pointless and uninteresting.  I *am* however, a fan of Wanda Sykes who provides a few really hilarious lines.  Unfortunately Continental Drift focuses on humor that people like Nicki Minaj, Snooki and others would prefer, and the same can be said for the rather uninspiring soundtrack we hear throughout the movie.  These issues crop up more than a few times.The squirrel's tireless search for the nut and unintentionally finding himself in several tricky situations returns yet again, and it never stops being funny (or weird) how the storyline involving the other animals suddenly stops so we can watch the mischievous squirrel go on a little adventure concerning his nut.  Always entertaining watching these segments.Overall, well it's a totally zanny adventure.  This time it's crazier than usual.

They completely wiped the smile off my face the minute Scrat's intro had finished divvying up the world and the other character's showed up to complain, snipe, and mistreat the plot with a few too many life lessons.  My reaction was visceral; I really really hate this movie.  I'm sorry I wasted my money on it, I'm sorry I wasted my time watching it.  If they manage to cough up another recycled mess to serve as Ice Age 5, I'm not buying it.As for this Ice Age, it's fraught with an excess of problems not the least of which is poor characterization and a paper-thin plot swiped from a better writer.  The few themes presented are lazy and didactic.  We have the usual clich&eacute;s: peer pressure, intolerance, how to destroy a friendship in one easy lesson, and what it takes to be a family, which includes an overbearing father and a permissive mother.  Children are invited to challenge and ignore parental rules....et cetera et al.  Also, the attempt to cram humanity into a fistful of furry caricatures has never been so blatant and clumsily mishandled.  The worst of it for me was learning from their bonus feature that they compare this to Homer's Odyssey.  Such a claim, considering what they produced, is pathetic at best, delusional at worst.  And!  It is not an homage to steal someone else's ideas, counterfeit them as your own, then screw them up in the process!

1491348,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B005LAIISA,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[0, 0]","***This review may contain spoilers***""Ice Age 4 - Continental Drift"" (hereafter IA4) is an ideal example of what I like to call ""Cinematic Dissonance"".  I define Cinematic Dissonance as the sensation when, watching a movie, your brain is telling you ""This is really silly and/or stupid!"" but your emotions are telling you ""I'm having a great time!"".  Therefore, I can understand and even somewhat agree with the 1- and 2-star reviewers of this movie who complain that IA4 is basically more of the hackneyed, predictable, improbable, and homogenized capers of Manny the Mammoth (Ray Romano) and company.  And yet, I side with the 3- and 4-star reviewers who enjoyed IA4 as an energetic, dynamic, funny seagoing adventure with allusions to Homer's ""The Odyssey"" that somehow still reinforces the themes of family, adolescent angst, loyalty, self-sacrifice, and home.With each succeeding ""Ice Age"" movie, logic and natural reality have been left further and further behind.  For example, by now, to appreciate the franchise, you have to accept that Scrat the obsessed saber-toothed squirrel's acorn pursuit will lead to more and more global catastrophic changes.  In IA4, he has caused the surprisingly fragile Pangea's fragmentation into the continents we know today.  We also have to accept that Manny is obstinately determined to keep his now-teenaged daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) safe, when actually male elephants hardly take part in raising offspring, and that Peaches' best friend is a mole/hedgehog (""molehog"") hybrid named Louis.  Of course, Peaches has also inherited her prehensile tail and tree-living abilities from her mother, Ellie (Queen Latifah).  The only other complication in our gang's essentially stable lives is the sudden abandonment of feisty Granny Sloth (Wanda Sykes) to Sid's (John Leguizamo's) care by his fly-by-night family.  Granny has a friend called ""Precious"", but it's certainly not a ring.  Hey, these are familiar domestic dramas, but IA4 still makes them interesting.But the continental shiftings and movements interrupt the drama and gradually separate Manny, Sid, Granny, and Diego the sensible sabertooth cat (Denis Leary) from the others.  Set adrift on an iceberg, Manny and friends encounter another iceberg - a ""pirate ship"" commanded by a Gigantopithecus (according to Wikipedia) named Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) and his zoo crew - including a blubbery elephant seal, a rabbit, a kangaroo, and an able-bodied first-mate female Smilodon named Shira.  So now the plot is established with several resolutions to be made: 1) Can Manny and his crew escape Captain Gutt's grasp? 2) Will Shira mutiny and change alliances? 3) Can Manny and his crew weather turbulent seas, fierce narwhals, and even (!) sirens to get back home, AND save a kidnapped Peaches and Ellie?, 4) Can Manny defeat Captain Gutt in battle? 5) Can klutzy Sid get along with his grandma and be a hero, 6) Can insecure Louis help save his friends, and finally 6) Is Precious real, or just Granny's hallucination? Oohwee!I think you know how all the above resolutions will play out.  Even so, I enjoyed them because I felt that all of IA4's characters were cheerfully giving their utmost to entertain us and having a grand time doing so.  Besides the vivacious characterizations, IA4 continues the breathtakingly solid and weighty photorealism of its backgrounds and animation.  Most importantly, IA4 continues to resist the self-consciousness of acting in a madcap, surreal story.  The characters believed in the story and told it well, and made me believe it, too.P.S.:  One other resolution - Scrat finds a treasure map that leads him to a legendary acorn paradise called ""Scratlantis"".  Does Scrat find the acorn of his dreams?  Wellll,.....P.P.S.:  By the way, Gigantopithecuses really did exist about 1 million years ago.  They were huge apes over 10 feet tall.  Therefore, it is quite plausible that Captain Gutt could fight and even toss around Manny.",4,"Latest Ice Age ""Odyssey"" Proves the Franchise Still Has Legs - to Some Degree",1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,3971,"['***This', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers***', 'Ice', 'Age', '4', 'Continental', 'Drift', 'hereafter', 'IA4', 'ideal', 'example', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'Cinematic', 'Dissonance', 'define', 'Cinematic', 'Dissonance', 'sensation', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'brain', 'telling', 'really', 'silly', 'and/or', 'stupid', 'emotions', 'are', 'telling', ""'m"", 'having', 'great', 'time', 'Therefore', 'can', 'understand', 'even', 'somewhat', 'agree', '1-', '2-star', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'who', 'complain', 'IA4', 'basically', 'more', 'hackneyed', 'predictable', 'improbable', 'homogenized', 'capers', 'Manny', 'Mammoth', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'company', 'yet', 'side', '3-', '4-star', 'reviewers', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'IA4', 'energetic', 'dynamic', 'funny', 'seagoing', 'adventure', 'allusions', 'Homer', 'Odyssey', 'somehow', 'still', 'themes', 'family', 'adolescent', 'angst', 'loyalty', 'self-sacrifice', 'succeeding', 'Ice', 'Age', 'movie', 'logic', 'natural', 'reality', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'further', 'further', 'behind', 'example', 'now', 'appreciate', 'franchise', 'have', 'accept', 'Scrat', 'obsessed', 'saber-toothed', 'squirrel', 'acorn', 'pursuit', 'will', 'lead', 'more', 'more', 'global', 'catastrophic', 'changes', 'IA4', 'caused', 'surprisingly', 'fragile', 'Pangea', 'fragmentation', 'continents', 'know', 'today', 'also', 'have', 'accept', 'Manny', 'obstinately', 'determined', 'keep', 'now-teenaged', 'daughter', 'Peaches', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'safe', 'when', 'actually', 'male', 'elephants', 'hardly', 'take', 'part', 'raising', 'offspring', 'Peaches', 'best', 'friend', 'mole/hedgehog', 'molehog', 'hybrid', 'named', 'Louis', 'course', 'Peaches', 'also', 'inherited', 'prehensile', 'tail', 'tree-living', 'abilities', 'mother', 'Ellie', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'only', 'other', 'complication', 'gang', 'essentially', 'stable', 'lives', 'sudden', 'abandonment', 'feisty', 'Granny', 'Sloth', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'Sid', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'care', 'fly-by-night', 'family', 'Granny', 'friend', 'called', 'Precious', 'certainly', 'not', 'ring', 'Hey', 'are', 'familiar', 'domestic', 'dramas', 'IA4', 'still', 'interesting.But', 'continental', 'shiftings', 'movements', 'interrupt', 'drama', 'gradually', 'separate', 'Manny', 'Sid', 'Granny', 'Diego', 'sensible', 'sabertooth', 'cat', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'others', 'Set', 'adrift', 'iceberg', 'Manny', 'friends', 'encounter', 'iceberg', 'pirate', 'ship', 'commanded', 'Gigantopithecus', 'according', 'Wikipedia', 'named', 'Captain', 'Gutt', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'zoo', 'crew', 'including', 'blubbery', 'elephant', 'seal', 'rabbit', 'kangaroo', 'able-bodied', 'first-mate', 'female', 'Smilodon', 'named', 'Shira', 'So', 'now', 'plot', 'established', 'several', 'resolutions', 'be', 'made', '1', 'Can', 'Manny', 'crew', 'escape', 'Captain', 'Gutt', 'grasp', '2', 'Will', 'Shira', 'mutiny', 'change', 'alliances', '3', 'Can', 'Manny', 'crew', 'weather', 'turbulent', 'seas', 'fierce', 'narwhals', 'even', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'AND', 'save', 'kidnapped', 'Peaches', 'Ellie', '4', 'Can', 'Manny', 'defeat', 'Captain', 'Gutt', 'battle', '5', 'Can', 'klutzy', 'Sid', 'get', 'grandma', 'be', 'hero', '6', 'Can', 'insecure', 'Louis', 'help', 'save', 'friends', 'finally', '6', 'Precious', 'real', 'just', 'Granny', 'hallucination', 'Oohwee', 'think', 'know', 'how', 'above', 'resolutions', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'Even', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'felt', 'IA4', 'characters', 'were', 'cheerfully', 'giving', 'utmost', 'entertain', 'having', 'grand', 'time', 'doing', 'so', 'vivacious', 'characterizations', 'IA4', 'breathtakingly', 'solid', 'weighty', 'photorealism', 'backgrounds', 'animation', 'Most', 'importantly', 'IA4', 'resist', 'self-consciousness', 'acting', 'madcap', 'surreal', 'story', 'characters', 'believed', 'story', 'told', 'well', 'made', 'believe', 'One', 'other', 'resolution', 'Scrat', 'treasure', 'map', 'legendary', 'acorn', 'paradise', 'called', 'Scratlantis', 'Does', 'Scrat', 'find', 'acorn', 'dreams', 'Wellll', '..P.P.S', 'way', 'Gigantopithecuses', 'really', 'did', 'exist', '1', 'million', 'years', 'ago', 'were', 'huge', 'apes', '10', 'feet', 'tall', 'Therefore', 'quite', 'plausible', 'Captain', 'Gutt', 'could', 'fight', 'even', 'toss', 'around', 'Manny']",N/A

The premise of the movie focuses on Manny's teenage daughter, Peaches. Scat's antics, the squirrel on the cover, cause an interesting turn of events leading the viewer to encounter a number of interesting new characters and ideas for the ice age series. Without spoiling the story, I can say that the film features a solid cast, strong family themes, and a simple and straightforward plot that while predictable and shallow, is both playful and fun. It is very enjoyable and engaging for those interested in a light hearted family film (that is good if you watch it alone as well).The video itself is wonderful from a technical standpoint. The colors are saturated, the detail in the fur and environment is sharp and interesting. While few and far between, the blacks showcase detail and texture that will prove to be interesting and engaging.The audio features a DTS-HD Master Audio and takes advantage of a wide dynamic range that while not blowing you out of your chair loud, will do nice to differentiate standard dialogue. The music found throughout the film is integral, yet never gets in the way of the dialogue which remains clear and understandable no matter what happens. For those with a powerful subwoofer, the movie will provide ample opportunities to exercise it.In total, this movie was fun, playful, and a great for the family.

And of course, the crazy adventures of Scrat and his acorn are always one of the highlights. This time around, he winds up in Scratlantis.

The first one was great, the others sequels less so and now with the arrival of the four hundred and forty fourth one, this series has hit an all time low.  This is just a weak movie all around.  When you pretty much know what the entire plot of the film is going to be in the first five minutes of the movie, you know you're in for a long boring, cliche ridden, been there done that, nothing remotely original sequel.  Spoiler alert, Manny and his daughter are reunited in the end and they're both sorry for what they said before they became separated.  Gee didn't see that one coming from like 200 miles away.  The only think I liked about this movie was ""Precious"" and even that character was not enough to save this awful cash grab.  Just like Shrek-this series seriously needs to end before they can milk it to death entirely .  Blue Sky Studios has done some incredibly original films over the years (Horton Hears a Who & Rio for instance), why they keep wasting time churning out more awful Ice Age sequels when they're capable of so much better is beyond me.  Oh yeah, the whole cash grab thing....  Regardless, it's time to move on please-Manny, Sid, Scrat and Diego need to be permanently retired.

Diego,Queen Latifah as Ellie,along with some newcomers like Keke Palmer as Peaches,Jennifer Lopez as Shira,Wanda Sykes as Granny,and even the dynamic duo of Nick Frost and Simon Pegg.This is,for my money,THE best of the series so far.It has adventure,it has excitement,it has laughs and it is all non stop family fun!The story finds Scrat starting out the proceedings,as usual.This time his well placed nut begins the Continental Drift that forms the land masses we have today.This sudden change in earth tectonics has Manny,Ellie and the gang on the run for safety to the land bridge.Manny's precious Peaches has now grown up and is quite the young teenaged lady.Thrown into the mix comes Sid's family,slip sliding away in a hollowed out log.They crash into the group and only stay long enough to dump Sid's granny onto them,and then leave.Before the group can reach the land bridge,Manny,Sid,Granny,and Diego are separated from the rest by a sudden upheaval of ice.As they drift away from Ellie and Peaches,Manny tells them to head for the land bridge and that they will return to find them.Not long after their separation Manny and the gang`s ice flow is captured by pirates,led by an ape called Gutt.He commands a rag tag group of animals indeed,from an elephant seal to a rabbit.When they make granny walk the plank,the group spring into action and rescue her.The group escapes from Gutt but in the process sink his large ice ship.A little ways away they rescue one of Gutts crew,a female saber toothed tiger named Shira,and keep her locked up.When they reach land Shira escapes and runs to rejoin Gutt and his crew,who are in a nearby cove planning to take the current back to land in a newly acquired ice ship.With the help of some new found friends,in the forms of over sized hamsters,they trick Gutt and his gang and steal his ship from him.As Manny and the rest sail away Gutt is already creating another ship to pursue them.Manny and the group reach the land bridge but at first do not find Ellie or Peaches.Suddenly a voice rings out and it`s Peaches;being held captive by Gutt,who has unfortunately beaten them home.Granny has an ace up her sleeve.On their way home she had been throwing fruit into the water to,what the group thought,was her imaginary friend.It turns out it was a ginormous whale,who she now calls upon to help.Manny and Gutt have a final showdown and Manny and his family are finally reunited.As a giant propeller,there is nothing that will get an ice boat across an ocean faster than a whale.They finally find new land,with the hamsters also joining them.The newest members of the herd are now Granny and Shira,Diego`s new girlfriend.The film ends as Scrat finds his version of the lost city of Atlantis;called Scrat-lantis.Nuts abound,which he ferociously gathers up.However the centre piece is a giant nut and he is told by the elder there(Patrick Stewart) not to touch it.Scrat of course cannot fight his instincts,and lifts it up.Underneath dangles a plug.The island sinks,dries and becomes part of the south western U.S. desert.Scrat screams as the blistering heat starts to scorch him.There are just so many funny and imaginative moments throughout this film as it moves from one thing to another in such fine fashion.I just loved the scene where the gang are drifting on an ice pack and Sid complains that there is so much water,and so little to drink.He takes a big gulp of sea water and swallows it.His face puckers right up as he realizes how salty it is.It is visually hilarious to see.They have added so much more voice talent to this movie along with,what looks like,some new and welcome additions to the herd.I like that.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette on its making,a look at the series so far,and a couple of musical segments.All in all,what can I say,I loved this film.It has a pace like no other in the franchise and it just never stopped moving throughout.The film is chock full of imaginative storytelling,adventure and its requisite sight gags.It is also a film the whole family can watch together and understand.Recommended
