882971,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B0007MAO02,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I was very favorably surprised and even to some extent impressed by this little known 1955 western, which on the surface of things tells the same story we saw thousands of times, but then takes us on a surprisingly wild ride thanks to strong dialogs, clever story twists and a FORMIDABLE performance by a stellar cast! Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.Precision: this film was also sometimes distributed as &#34;Rough Company&#34;If evr there was a remake of this film, it could be very well adapted into a fantasy film or a medieval drama without really changing anything to the plot and dramatis personae. The introduction to the story would then go something like that:&#34;Once upon a time, in a country far away, there was a large valley, where farmers and cattle herders lived. People mostly minded their own businesses and met just occasionally in a small town situated in the middle of the valley, from which an old but brave and wise Sheriff preserved the peace. It was a tough place and tough people lived there - and yet for many years there was peace there.But there was also darkness in this happy valley. Large part of the land belonged to the domain of Anchor, where a grim, aged, crippled Lord dwelled, thirsting for always more land and power, dreaming darkly about days when he will be the only Master of the Valley. This Lord was married since many years to a Wicked Witch and he had also at his side a Dark Captain, his own brother and second in command. This merciless man, fond of murder, arson, strong liquor and brown skinned busty wenches, had a well deserved sinister reputation, acquired both abroad and in the valley, of a guy who fears nobody and would recoil from nothing. The domain of Anchor was large and wealthy and many sinister thugs bore its colors, none of which was worse than the First Sword, a cold-blooded murderer and sniggering sadist, who killed as much for money as for his own pleasure...The Lord of Anchor caused trouble long time before, but was then contained (barely) and forced to sue for peace - even if some old scores remained unsettled and some old hatreds never died... But then one day, after many years of calm, the gates of the sinister domain opened, the Riders of Anchor emerged - and the peace in the land was shattered and innocent blood stained the valley again... Fearing for their lives many men surrendered their lands to Anchor in exchange for token payments, even if the old Sheriff tried to protect them.Others however tried to unite and resist, but they were leaderless and lacked war time skills -  and therefore were no match for the Dark Captain, First Sword and their horde of evil-doers. But all that changed one day, when the master of Anchor picked up the fight with the one guy he should have left in peace, especially considering that this scarred veteran of ancient wars, known as the Man Without Sword, was on his way out of the valley with his future Bride ...The fight still seemed very unequal, but not evil is as strong as it seems - and indeed, there is also trouble stirring INSIDE the sinister domain of Anchor, although few are aware of it. One of those who know is the Princess of Anchor, young, fierce and proud daughter of the grim Lord and Wicked Witch - and because she knows, sad is her face and heavy her heart...  And this is precisely at that moment that our story begins...&#34;The story as we can see is absolutely banal and was adapted to the screen like a thousand of times. But the clever scenario and strong dialogs made it into something much better than just another western B-movie. Be prepared for some rather unexpected twists and especially for a range war which looks surprisingly as a REAL war...All of above was made even better by the stellar cast and the great performance by all actors:- The crippled, grim Lord of Anchor, a.k.a. Lew Wilkison, is played by no other than Hollywood's &#34;Blackguard Extraordinaire&#34;, Edward G. Robinson, grandiose as always- The Wicked Witch of Anchor, a. k.a. Martha Wilkison, is played by Hollywood's &#34;Uber-Bitch&#34;, Barbara Stanwyck, splendid as always- The Man Without Sword, a.k.a. Captain John Parrish, is played by Glenn Ford, excellent as always- The Dark Captain of Anchor, a.k.a. Cole Wilkison, is played by Brian Keith, who was at that time just beginning his long and succesful career as actor, but was already a decorated veteran of Pacific War (he served in US Marine Corps aviation)- The First Sword of Anchor, a.k.a. Wade Matlock, is played by Richard Jaeckel, who after this film became immediately Hollywood's &#34;go to guy&#34;, when an evil gunfighter was urgently neeeded - before portraying splendidly Sergeant Bowren in &#34;Dirty Dozen&#34;- The Princess of Anchor, a.k.a. Judith Wilkison, is played by Dianne Foster, an actress who played a lot in westerns, both in cinema and on TV, in the 50s and 60s, before willingly retiring in 1966. Of all the main actors in this film she is the last to still be with us, as of June 2014...If there is one thing which I think could be improved is a better development of one part of the plot which concludes in the very last scene and which actually is a particularly clever (and sooo medieval) twist. Adding five minutes to this film and developping a little bit the very antagonistic relationship between the Princess of Anchor and the Man Without Sword, who is a sworn, deadly enemy of her father and uncle, would make this film even better.But still, this is a very good, quite surprising western, which I liked A LOT. A recommended viewing. ENJOY!",5,"""We are going to be neighbors for a long time.

882972,A3G2GATVPBWGA9,B0007MAO02,Mike,"[0, 0]","Some years ago a magazine printed their list of the &#8220;top 100 Westerns&#8221;.  It features films that match Mark Twain&#8217;s comment about classic books: they&#8217;re ones you want to have read, but don&#8217;t want to read.  This isn&#8217;t that kind of classic. You watch it because it is a fun film, not a film breaking new ground in cinematography.  It is testament to the observation that some notoriety is due to the power of suggestion, and this one is under rated for no clear reason.  This Western makes my list of top 100 Westerns, easily. The acting is good: Glenn Ford, Barbara Stanwick, Brian Keith, and so on... they paid for some top rank talent.  Like other mid-fifties Westerns, the hero is heroic, but not of the John Wayne-Clint Eastwood stripe.  Ford&#8217;s character is more the Jimmy Stewart type: more human, more conflicted.  His character hates violence (don&#8217;t we all?) and wants to avoid it (if only it was that simple!).  But a neighboring ranch wants a monopoly on local land and tries to push him out, forcing him to resort to the use of his military skills from the recent war.  It's always fun when the bully picks on the wrong guy.  In the process, he loses one girlfriend whose only interest in him was a ticket out of town.  Meanwhile, the bad guys have their own in-house intrigues.  Set against the Sierra Nevada range near Lone Pine (a sort of arid Tetons), the scenery is superb, which sure doesn&#8217;t hurt.  With Mount Whitney in the background, a range war boils and when the dust settles, good triumphs.  Modern westerns often seem morally spineless and needlessly profane.  You can watch this and sense why Westerns were a bigger deal in the 1950s than now.  No one needs their mouths washed out with soap, and all of the women keep their clothes on. No one is an Olympic league marksman so as to strain credulity.  And they don&#8217;t shoot it on the back lot of the studio near Los Angeles.

With all the Cult Classic heroes coming to life for Product promotion, it is easy to stereotype certain actors.  Edward G Robinson will always be known as the gangster, ""Little Cesar"".  And it is not far from his role in ""The Violent Men"".  He plays his part superbly, and we watch his character transform from a powerful, unyielding, Landowner, to a humble, forgiving, fool.  That is all I can say about that without giving away anything.  I don't talk about Glenn Ford a lot, simply because this movie brings to light so many of his talents.  After discussing with many others, this is perhaps one of the Top 20 Westerns, and a must have for contemporary collectors.

882974,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0007MAO02,Only-A-Child,"[8, 10]","Extremely entertaining mid-1950's western that packs a whole lot into just a 96-minute running time. Most viewers will quickly get drawn into this story and will find the experience quite enjoyable. More than just a B-Western but not really an epic, the budget was modest and the cast affordable despite several big names. Glenn Ford was the only box office draw at the time. Edward G. Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck were past their primes and looking for work, Stanwyck was 10 years away from a new popularity in ""The Big Valley"". Brian Keith and Dianne Foster were just starting out.Ford plays John Parrish, a small rancher who decides to sell out when the sympathetic sheriff is murdered by the big rancher's (Robinson) hired gunman. Parrish is a former Confederate officer who only moved out west for health reasons.Robinson plays Lee Wilkison, who already owns most of the valley and intends to acquire the rest, making good on a promise to his wife Martha (Stanwyck). Lee was crippled in a land war he fought 12 years earlier; his brother Cole (Keith) has come up from Texas to help him run the huge spread. Lee has been turning a blind eye to obvious hookups between Stanwyck and Keith but sensitive daughter Judith (Foster) is understandably upset by what is going on in their home.John Parrish has promised his fianc&eacute;e Caroline (May Winn) that he will move back east. Caroline, who is modeled on Grace Kelly's ""High Noon"" character, breaks off the engagement at the first sign of trouble and simply disappears from the film. This leaves the way open for a John and Judith romance to develop.The violence starts early and continues throughout the film, with Parrish able to apply military tactics against an enemy who underestimates his ability and determination. He has a very original confrontation with the main gunfighter about midway into the film. Ford plays one of his standard characters; the modest guy who disarms everyone with a self- deprecating manner, who is slow to take offense but brutal when finally provoked (very much like his role in ""The Sheepman"").Robinson is likewise excellent as a man who maintains his personal integrity even though physically just a shadow of his former self. And he gets enough lines and screen time to adequately develop his character.Stanwyck has the most difficult role and she is simply not convincing as the classic two-faced woman, a seemingly loyal wife who is scheming to replace her husband with his brother. In part this is because she is not allocated enough time to do anything more than superficially convey either side of the character. That said, a talented actress could have done a much better job even with these limitations.Dianne Foster is a pleasant surprise. She should remind viewers a lot of Carroll Baker, both physically and in acting style. Although required to play Judith according to 1950's convention (she is allowed to be tough but then required to break into hysterics after each major confrontation), Foster shows a nice range. She conveys a growing attraction for Parrish but does it so subtly that it is only in retrospect that the various clues click into place.The real problem with ""The Violent Men"" is that it tries to be both an action western and a character study morality play. Because so much has to happen on the screen much of the action is rushed and many of the characters get only a cursory treatment. This is neither fatal flaw nor a reason to avoid the film, but it could have been significantly better with another 20 minutes of running time or the absence of an unnecessary character like Caroline.Then again, what do I know?

By coincidence two of my aunts showed up at the same hotel. We went to dinner at the The Fontainebleau Hotel and I ate 2 of their huge corned beef sandwiches and a giant banana split, both of which they bragged were the largest on the beach. As we wandered south on Collins, and turned onto Lincoln, there at a small movie house was playing The Violent men.Glenn Ford played John Parrish, a small cattle ranch owner and former swashbuckling Confederate Cavalry officer with much Civil War combat experience under his belt. He was considering selling out to the Wilkensons, mega ranchers, who are plotting to take over the entire valley, by force if necessary. Cole Wilkenson, in a hurry, crosses the line with, the seemingly mild mannered Parrish, when the first wave of violence strikes underthe direction of Brian Keith (Cole Wilkenson), whose edgy relationship with his older brother, now crippled, Edward G.Robinson, the builder of Anchor Ranch, Lew Wilkenson, and Coles affair with the always brilliant Barbara Stanwick, puts pressure on everyone.Ford, not used to being pushed around, begins guerilla operations, ala Rambo, in what is a range war neither Keith, Stanwick nor Robinson ever bargained for. Meanwhile Stanwick juggles, the husband on which she is cheating, her daughter, Diane Foster, suspicious of her relationship with Cole, who is also Juggling an affair with a Lady of the town and Stanwick (whattaguy!). The entire mess explodes into a war, within a war, within a war, and a plot of which the original script writer, William Shakespeare, would have been proud.

His performance in this one is not up to that one, and the film itself is only so-so by comparison. The amazon on-demand version is in CinemaScope, which is perfect for outdoor westerns with lots of scenery.But the script of this movie is predictable and the characters are little more than cardboard caricatures. The scenes, situations, and relationships inside the ranch house with its unrealistically vast rooms are like TV soap opera. There's only a single scene that comes as a surprise - about 50 minutes into the movie - when you think it's going to finally take off and become a whole lot more interesting, but it quickly fades back into a tired old groove again.I think with a strong cast (as this surely has) and strong direction, you can put a lot of life into even a tired, predictable script. The weak link in this film was apparently the direction. The heavy use of music on the soundtrack tries but can't overcome the lack of energy on the screen.

882980,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B0007MAO02,Simon Davis,"[17, 20]","I have a rapidly growing affection for all the great Western classics produced during the 1950's and while Columbia Studios' ""The Violent Men"", would never be at the top of anyone's list of classic westerns it has a real appeal on many different levels that makes it essential viewing for western fans. It combines an extremely interesting human drama with the usual rugged action scenes set against some of the most spectacular outdoor scenery photographed in beautiful colour and cinemscope that you will find in any western. The real strength in ""The Violent Men"", is however it's wonderful cast of seasoned veterans who give their all and make the most of the characters and the conflicts they all find themselves in. Veterans Glenn Ford, and in particular the legendary pair Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson, reunited again all those years after their classic teaming in ""Double Indemnity"", don't disappoint in this action filled story about greed and principle and the consequences that both bring into the main characters lives.Based on the novel by Donald Hamilton, ""The Violent Men"", stars Glenn Ford as John Parrish, a Captain from the Civil War who was injured and travels west to recuperate. John finds himself farming a small spread in a valley slowly being eaten up by crippled land baron Lee Wilkison (Edward G. Robinson), who to fulfill a promise to his deceitful wife Martha (Barbara Stanwyck), uses fair means or foul to buy up all the surrounding properties so that his spread will include the entire valley. Goaded on by his anxious fiance Caroline (May Wynn) John is agreeable to sell to Wilkison so that he can marry and then go back east. However when Wilison's younger brother Cole (Brian Keith), comes on the scene things begin to get very dirty with hired killers taking out any opposition to their bosse's plans. The local sheriff is killed in cold blood and his replacement is in the pay of the Wilkison clan and doesn't oppose their unlawful activities. When one of John's cattle men is killed by one of Cole's henchmen Wade Matlock (Richard Jaeckel), and he cannot get any assistance from the law, John decides against selling and digs in to defend his land and refuses the motley sum that Lee Wilkison had offered him for it. Meanwhile Lee has other problems in that the scheming Martha resumes her earlier affair with Cole and daughter Judith (Dianne Foster), who learning about her mother's infidelity removes herself from any real contact with her family. The war against John Parrish and his men hots up with Cole burning down the Parrish ranch however John uses some of his cavalry experience to ambush Cole's men with many losing their lives. He then plans a counter attack involving a massive cattle stampede and succeeds in burning down the Wilkison homestead. In the attempt to escape the flames Martha finally reveals her true feelings for her husband by throwing his walking stick into the flames and escaping, leaving her husband to die in the burning house. Thinking him dead Martha teams up with Cole however Judith discovers her father still alive in the ruins of their house and John takes them along with him to finish the work of removing Martha and Cole from the scene. Martha and Cole make plans to rebuild the ranch however upon arriving back there they make the unpleasant discovery that not only is Lee still alive but that he has taken control again dismissing all the hired killers and ordering them off the property. John and Cole square off against each other and Cole is killed in a fiery showdown that also sees Martha meeting her maker at the hands of Cole's cast off lover. Reconciled now Lee and an admiring Judith offer John the opportunity of staying in the valley managing the entire property which he now happily accepts.A ""good old fashioned western"", is the best way to describe ""The Violent Men"". The characters are all clearly etched so the bad guys and the good guys are plain to see. As mentioned the chief strength of the film is the key performers and Ford, Stanwyck, Robinson and Keith make an interesting and quite dynamic team when locking horns. Glenn Ford I believe delivers a most interesting ""reluctant hero"", type of performance here as the peace loving man forced by circumstances to take up arms to defend a principle. His transition from the placid gentleman intent upon marrying and moving back east and who in his own words ""owes this valley nothing"", into the ruthless action man that circumstances have made him is an interesting and highly believable one. Barbara Stanwyck in the role of the unlikeable and deceitful wife of Edward G. Robinson also excels and her performance still displays the expected Stanwyck magic in a decade where she unfortunately was finding it hard to get the meaty dramatic roles which she had previously excelled in. Her chemistry with Edward G. Robinson is still excellent however all those years after ""Double Indemnity"" and Robinson once again shows his versatility with a well thought out performance as the ruthless invalid land Baron who manages to largely transform from a villian to a partially sympathetic character before the film's conclusion. Brian Keith in an early role also has an interesting part as the cold blooded and opportunistic younger brother of Robinson's character who is having an affair with his wife. ""The Violent Men"", marked one of the first major roles for Keith and his growing confidence as an actor can be seen in every frame and his interactions with seasoned veterans such as Stanwyck and Robinson have a real electricity about them that clearly marked him down for better roles in the next decade. Often just passed off as yet another formula western by some the production values in ""The Violent Men"", are second to none with the superb cinematography used against the backdrop of the spectacular snow covered Nevada mountains giving the hotly disputed valley of the story a beautiful almost other worldly quality. Since never once does the action move out of this valley this isolated effect away from people and proper justice is superbly conveyed explaining why the main characters take matters into their own hands to get what they want. Max Steiner's well thought out musical score also combines well with both the action and the setting and provides a fine companion to the building tension as the story develops. Jean Louis, the famed clothes designer who is better remembered for designing glamourous clothes for many of Lana Turner's plush melodramas also displays his versatility here in the western genre with the authentic and beautiful clothes of the main characters. While there has been dispute about the authenticity of some of the hairstyles for this period used in the film the clothes with their historical accuracy more than make up for that lapse.In a decade saturated with western themed stories both in the cinemas and on television ""The Violent Men"", still manages to have its own unique points that have allowed it to pass the test of time. Far from being the best western produced in the decade it still is a vivid examination of human greed and human endurance and the lengths one will go to defend what is rightfully theirs. That theme is just as timely today as it was back in the 1950's. Of course for any western buff or lover of classic Hollywood it's a joy to see old costars Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson strutting their stuff in a seemingly so effortless way in a tale full of passion, greed and deceit. Not up to their earlier ""Double Indemnity"" standards for sure but this is a different film with a different story and they help breath life into what in other hands wouldn't be half as good. For a nostalgia filled trip back to the golden decade of western film making ""The Violent Men"", with its trio of legendary performers makes great viewing in this new DVD release.",4,Memorable Battle

882982,A3BMRSE8N1858V,B0007MAO02,Terence Allen,"[50, 51]","In The Violent Men, Glenn Ford plays a rancher who owns a small spread in a valley being consumed by a hardbitten, crippled rancher played by Edward G. Robinson. Robinson's character was a pioneer, and feels that he is entitled to get as much of territory as he can get his hands on, and is close to getting it all, except for Ford's ranch and a few other small ranches.Ford is getting ready to sell out to Robinson when the movie begins, but quickly changes his mind when Robinson's tactics become more and more violent. Robinson is aided by a seemingly dutiful wife, play by Barbara Stanwyck (very different from the Helen Barkley character she would play years later on the television series, The Big Valley), and by Robinson's younger, hotheaded brother, played by Brian Keith. Robinson also has a daughter who is none too fond of his tactics.When Ford decides to stay, he organizes the other small ranchers, and a fullscale range war begins, with scorched earth tactics employed by both sides. Complicating matters is the fact that Stanwyck and Keith are having an affair, and have their own plans for Robinson's cattle empire.The Violent Men is a very enjoyable western with solid performances by everyone involved.",4,Entertaining Glenn Ford Western,1107907200,"02 9, 2005",2005,1221,"['Violent', 'Men', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'rancher', 'who', 'small', 'spread', 'valley', 'being', 'consumed', 'hardbitten', 'crippled', 'rancher', 'played', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'Robinson', 'character', 'was', 'pioneer', 'feels', 'entitled', 'get', 'much', 'territory', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'close', 'getting', 'Ford', 'ranch', 'few', 'other', 'small', 'ranches.Ford', 'getting', 'ready', 'sell', 'out', 'Robinson', 'when', 'movie', 'quickly', 'mind', 'when', 'Robinson', 'tactics', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'violent', 'Robinson', 'aided', 'seemingly', 'dutiful', 'wife', 'play', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'very', 'different', 'Helen', 'Barkley', 'character', 'would', 'play', 'years', 'later', 'television', 'series', 'Big', 'Valley', 'Robinson', 'younger', 'hotheaded', 'brother', 'played', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'Robinson', 'also', 'daughter', 'who', 'none', 'too', 'fond', 'tactics.When', 'Ford', 'stay', 'other', 'small', 'ranchers', 'fullscale', 'range', 'war', 'scorched', 'earth', 'tactics', 'employed', 'sides', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'fact', 'Stanwyck', 'Keith', 'are', 'having', 'affair', 'have', 'own', 'plans', 'Robinson', 'cattle', 'empire.The', 'Violent', 'Men', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'western', 'solid', 'performances', 'everyone', 'involved']",N/A
