Anyways, the story, acting, and timing is good. There is no blood or gore in the r-rated version, matter of fact it's could be pg-13. I didn't know there was an unrated version when I bought it and that is something I can't stand is unrated films. There is a site where you can check the difference between films but this one didn't have this movie up yet. I don't know how gory it could have been. So yea, it's a basic pg-13 horror film with a good cast but very little blood and no gore. The film doesn't really make sense in some scenes but I guess i'll have to wait for the website to get ahold of the copy to see if I missed anything. The movie gets funny towards the end when they find the owner's nephew, Frank. Other then a few dumb laughs, stay away from this movie or at least get the unrated version. Also, the guy on the cover doesn't even appear in the r rated version.",1,Wreckage Rated Version,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,984,"['saw', 'movie', 'cheap', 'sounded', 'good', 'Yea', ""n't"", 'horror', 'movie', 'reviews', 'start', 'way', 'Anyways', 'story', 'acting', 'timing', 'good', 'blood', 'gore', 'r-rated', 'version', 'matter', 'fact', 'could', 'be', 'pg-13', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'unrated', 'version', 'when', 'bought', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'unrated', 'films', 'site', 'where', 'can', 'check', 'difference', 'films', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'up', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'gory', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'So', 'yea', 'basic', 'pg-13', 'horror', 'film', 'good', 'cast', 'very', 'little', 'blood', 'gore', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'scenes', 'guess', 'i', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'website', 'get', 'ahold', 'copy', 'see', 'missed', 'anything', 'movie', 'funny', 'end', 'when', 'find', 'owner', 'nephew', 'Frank', 'Other', 'then', 'few', 'dumb', 'laughs', 'stay', 'away', 'movie', 'least', 'get', 'unrated', 'version', 'Also', 'guy', 'cover', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', 'r', 'rated', 'version']",Wreckage Unrated
1523951,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B0070ZDMYE,blackaciddevil,"[1, 1]","Wreckage follows a group of teenagers who head to a junkyard to salvage a few parts when their car breaks down. Unbeknownst to them, a crazy serial killer has broke out of prison and is in the area. One by one, they're hunted down. In the end, it becomes an ultimate struggle for survival.This slasher film, although a decent watch, is all over the place. When you watch the movie, you'll see it raises more questions in your mind than it needs to. I know Director John Mallory Asher was, probably, trying to build up the story into something big...but, if it were simple & a little more tightly focused, it could have achieved the same thing. Sure, everything is tied together neatly by the end but all that extra baggage was for naught. Too, the film isn't very long and that's another thing that is against it. Two things the movie does have going for it is that it looks pretty good to be a low-budget affair & the acting was good.Wreckage is, I'll say it again, a decent watch. However, it's not worth more than a rental.

1523952,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B0070ZDMYE,Compay,"[0, 0]","After watching a string of sub-par horror and slasher movies from Redbox, I didn't expect much from Wreckage.  But in the end, it was a decent little movie night flick.  Despite its shortcomings, Wreckage was actually a fun watch.Wreckage tells the story about a group of young people from rural North Carolina that make their way to a remote junkyard after breaking down on the highway. What they don't realize is that a convicted killer from the next town over has escaped prison, and is making his way towards them. Victims are picked off one by one as they try to discover who is responsible for the killings.Wreckage is a low-budget movie, so don't expect theater-quality performances. Most of the cast worked in television rather than movies, and a few hadn't acted before Wreckage, so the acting is slightly below average. Fortunately the older and more seasoned cast members make up for the film's lack of experienced actors.The story itself isn't anything special. The film's ""twist"" is predictable about halfway through the movie, with some foreshadowing even earlier than that which gives you a clue as to what the twist may be.All that having been said, Wreckage is still entertaining. Even though the story isn't that great, the writing for the dialogue is surprisingly good. For this being David Frigerio's first full-length film screenplay, he put together some clever speaking scenes.There's a decent little bit of gore, although a few of the murders take place off-screen. But what makes Wreckage an enjoyable horror flick is that they managed to keep it funny where it counts. Scoot McNairy steals every scene he's in as the backwoods owner of the junkyard. While the whole ""ignorant hillbilly"" character is a little outdated, Scoot constantly delivers the best lines of the movie, with perfect comedic timing. Even after the credits finish rolling, there's a funny extended scene with him which I'm convinced was half-improvised.Not sure if I'd buy the DVD, but Wreckage was definitely worth a rent. It's not exactly theater-quality, but if you're a horror fan looking to have a fun evening with a B-Movie, you should check it out.",3,Surprisingly Fun for Being Straight-to-DVD,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,2150,"['watching', 'string', 'sub-par', 'horror', 'slasher', 'movies', 'Redbox', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'Wreckage', 'end', 'was', 'decent', 'little', 'movie', 'night', 'flick', 'shortcomings', 'Wreckage', 'was', 'actually', 'fun', 'watch.Wreckage', 'story', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'rural', 'North', 'Carolina', 'make', 'way', 'remote', 'junkyard', 'breaking', 'down', 'highway', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'convicted', 'killer', 'next', 'town', 'escaped', 'prison', 'making', 'way', 'Victims', 'are', 'picked', 'one', 'one', 'try', 'discover', 'who', 'responsible', 'killings.Wreckage', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'theater-quality', 'performances', 'Most', 'cast', 'worked', 'television', 'rather', 'movies', 'few', 'had', ""n't"", 'acted', 'before', 'Wreckage', 'acting', 'slightly', 'below', 'average', 'Fortunately', 'older', 'more', 'seasoned', 'cast', 'members', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'lack', 'experienced', 'actors.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'film', 'twist', 'predictable', 'halfway', 'movie', 'foreshadowing', 'even', 'earlier', 'clue', 'what', 'twist', 'may', 'be.All', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'Wreckage', 'still', 'entertaining', 'Even', 'story', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'writing', 'dialogue', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'being', 'David', 'Frigerio', 'first', 'full-length', 'film', 'screenplay', 'put', 'together', 'clever', 'speaking', 'scenes.There', 'decent', 'little', 'bit', 'gore', 'few', 'murders', 'take', 'place', 'off-screen', 'what', 'Wreckage', 'enjoyable', 'horror', 'flick', 'managed', 'keep', 'funny', 'where', 'Scoot', 'McNairy', 'steals', 'scene', 'backwoods', 'owner', 'junkyard', 'whole', 'ignorant', 'hillbilly', 'character', 'little', 'outdated', 'Scoot', 'constantly', 'best', 'lines', 'movie', 'perfect', 'comedic', 'timing', 'Even', 'credits', 'finish', 'rolling', 'funny', 'extended', 'scene', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'was', 'half-improvised.Not', 'sure', ""'d"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'Wreckage', 'was', 'definitely', 'worth', 'rent', 'not', 'exactly', 'theater-quality', ""'re"", 'horror', 'fan', 'looking', 'have', 'fun', 'evening', 'B-Movie', 'should', 'check', 'out']",Wreckage Unrated

To further add fuel to that fire is having 13 producers which is over twice the number of actors in this movie with speaking roles exceeding two sentences. Twice during the beginning credits and once at the end is a large chunk of time devoted to showcasing and advertising studios. Two or three times we see: Phase 4 Films; Camelot Entertainment; Darknight Pictures; Yale Productions; Frigerio Films; Ashland Films; Xanthus Pictures; Downhome Entertainment.Sandwiched between this self promotion was a short film about young brothers one of whom unrealistically shoots his mom and her boyfriend then years later we learn that the innocent brother has taken the jail time rap to cover his brother's killing indiscretion. The imprisoned, now older, brother decides to escape. Meanwhile his younger brother is with a small group of adults in a wrecking yard looking for a car part to fix their broken vehicle. Some people die. Usual formula portrayal of dumb decisions by the victims and dumb cops fill in the storyline.
