There are some secular and political messages embedded that are counter to Biblical messages and may pass off as Biblical to those unfamiliar with the faith. For example, the show leans towards the political left which most often promotes secular social issues that are against Judeo-Christian Biblical values. Additionally, the show points towards the Protestant church but fails to relate the belief in terms of Christ mentioning only an esoteric God. Christ was not mentioned until Season 6 episode 7 in a lesson on works that was not fully presented but supported the storyline of that episode. In short, critical elements of the a ministers life are omitted and sensitive social topics are not explored.

1017096,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B000HWZ4IE,MollyRK,"[49, 53]","With no announcement for 7th Heaven's third season after the February 2005 release of season two (unless you count the temporary, roughly estimated release date that was quickly cancelled due to poor sales from the original two boxed sets), many longtime fans of this historical television series resorted themselves to the thought that no DVD treatment would be given to the several remaining seasons. Now, a year and a half later, we have been pleasantly surprised to find that the next season will be out on DVD in November--just in time for the holidays, too!The gradual progression and success of 7th Heaven has, in tune with its title, been something of a modern-day miracle. Eternally repetitive plot threads and weak writing have characterized the show's most recent years, but think of how this particular series stacks up against contemporary classics like ""The Waltons"" and ""Little House on the Prairie."" The timeless themes of family, Christian values, and survival against life's turmoils were at the heart of those two TV shows, and now they have also transformed 7th Heaven into a unique viewing experience that legions of fans clearly still love to watch. The decision to resurrect the show after the highly publicized and allegedly ""final"" 10th season is truly a miraculous feat, and while that choice has been quite a controversial one, anyone who grew up watching 7th Heaven can't help but be curious about the seemingly interesting and dramatic ideas that are being planned for Season 11.7th Heaven has undoubtedly aged over time, but I give this particular Season 3 five stars for its fresh, vibrant, and youthful spirit. Many can argue that this is where the series officially took off, with the five original Camden kids beginning to grow into more independent, fleshed-out characters. The news of Annie's pregnancy in the season opener and the birth of their twin boys on Valentine's Day (that makes seven kids total for lovebirds Eric and Annie!) are the most obvious highlights from this year, but there are many other unique, well-written episodes that chronicle the daily events in the lives of a growing, changing American family. Oldest son Matt has a great relationship going with his girlfriend until an old flame re-enters his life, while the ever-famous high school junior Mary thrives with basketball and academics (savor this season, folks: it is the one where Mary is at the top of her game, before she begins her gradual downhill spiral and before viewers witness the shattering of both her confidence and her future in Season 4). Sweet, insecure sophomore Lucy develops new friendships with some girls at school (including a classmate who is a cutter) and foolishly dives into a relationship with an older guy in order to have a rare edge over her superachieving older sister. Middle schooler Simon is the same levelheaded, inquisitive child who suddenly finds himself threatened by a gun-holding classmate, and brassy little second grader Ruthie--who is no longer the baby of the family--revolts against the extensive attention being given to her new brothers. The strong and incredibly sweet chemistry between Eric and Annie reigns supreme, through good times and bad. Catherine Hicks' work on this show has always been somewhat up-and-down, but in my opinion this third season was her finest hour. She really delivered head-on as a patient, loving and emotional middle-aged woman, mothering five children of varying ages and pregnant with two more. I absolutely loved the season premiere, where she was screaming at Eric about the chicken. Hicks really had an opportunity to show her comedic flair here, and at the same time she did an outstanding job at portraying a mother struggling to take care of her large family. Furthermore, the types of people whom Reverend Eric Camden counsels and supports through his work remain very interesting and are fueled by his kind, consistent guidance with alcoholic husbands, 12-year-old kids with guns, self-destructive teenagers, and (a popular favorite with the writers) young pregnant women. All of these ingredients make for a successful season that is arguably one of 7th Heaven's very best, and it should not be missed.Season 3 holds up quite nicely with a positive message and youthful energy that fans will love revisiting. It is certainly worth the purchase if you're a fan, and it's a good idea to show your support if you want to see future seasons on DVD. There's a generous number of seasons still to be released, and whether or not we will see them all on DVD is about as much unknown as the official conclusion of the series itself (hopefully they will bow out for good after the impending Season 11, but you just never know). Purchasing all those seasons on DVD would be quite an investment, but worth every penny if this is a show you love.Also, as indicated on the cover art picture, the packaging is a bit different from the first 2 sets, which may disappoint those who really liked the individual jewel cases for each disc. This time around, it is one single jewel case with all six discs inside. The episode guide/synopses are displayed very nicely, too, so fans shouldn't be too disappointed with the change.Perhaps the best news of all, though, is that only mere weeks after the release of this season, the Season 4 set was announced for March 2007! It is excellent news to see that they appear to be picking up the pace with the many more sets they still have to put out, although I still don't understand why it is so difficult for them to come up with some extras. For a show that has remained on the air for 11 seasons (and counting) and is hailed as the longest-running drama series in history, you can't tell me that there is no interesting behind-the-scenes footage for them to add to the DVD's. A show running that long absolutely has to have a unique story about how they reached that point and what it has meant for the actors who have stuck with them. I just have a hard time believing that, at the very least, they couldn't scounge up a couple of interviews, ESPECIALLY for a series that is still on the air. I'm sure Stephen Collins and Beverley Mitchell, in particular (the only two cast members to appear in every episode to date and, arguably, the most passionate actors on the show) wouldn't have a problem with doing a few commentaries, either, so why haven't we seen them? Granted, I buy these DVD's primarily for the episodes and will continue to buy any and all seasons that they choose to release, but for a $34.99 (approximately) charge per season, a little something extra would be nice.",5,Long-awaited Round Three finally eases fans!,1157068800,"09 1, 2006",2006,6616,"['announcement', '7th', 'Heaven', 'third', 'season', 'February', '2005', 'release', 'season',

Most of the Tv shows are full of sex, violence low moral, and foul language, but 7th Heaven has a higher standard. I am sorry to see that this show is no longer on the air, but am so pleased and overjoyed that I can buy the series on DVD.For those of you who don't know, this season is about Annie Camden give birth to twins  In other developments, Annie's widowed father, Charles Jackson (Graham Jarvis), has a big surprise for the whole Camden family. Matt Camden (Barry Watson) kindles his romance with a former girlfriend and Lucy Camden still has boyfriend trouble. There is always continuing issues with Mary (Jessica Biel). She is still in the awkward stages of being trapped between tough rough teenage years and trying to be an adult. And as for the youngest Camden son Simon (David Gallagher) undergoing his first love.This show will be missed!

1017103,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,B000HWZ4IE,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[16, 17]","I love 7TH HEAVEN, which is TV's longest-running family comedy-drama.  While season eleven (!) keeps going in prime time on Sunday nights, season three is on DVD and season four is on the way.  This was one of the late Aaron Spelling's crown jewels in forty years of producing evening TV dramas, and Brenda Hampton is the creator and still head writer after eleven seasons.  And the cast is just impeccable:  Stephen Collins and Catherine Hicks as parents Eric and Annie Camden; and, in descending order as their five kids, Barry Watson as college-age Matt, Jessica Biel as basketball lover and independent Mary, Beverley Mitchell as boy-obsessed Lucy, David Gallagher as teenage Simon, and Mackenzie Rosman as precocious little Ruthie (who doesn't seem so little when she and a boyfriend get tattoos in season 11).Watch season 11 in prime time (Sunday night on the CW network), then put on a season three DVD episode; it is like looking through a very special family album.  Were the kids ever that little?  Season three, which I am reviewing here, is a wonderful time capsule DVD.  I think I like it more than season 11.  Season 11 is more sex-obsessed with everyone and not as carefully written as season 3.  And, of course, it is a treat and an honor to have all 22 season 3 episodes in one convenient DVD that is uncut and non-commercial on six disks.  Conflicts may be resolved too easily, but the show gets into some powerful themes and is superbly acted.Each disk has four episodes that are about 45 minutes each without commercials.  In disk 1 Annie announces that she is pregnant, a frat house initiation is almost fatal, and Lucy's new girl friend is a (wrist) cutter.In disk 2, Matt gets arrested and his car stolen while helping a girl with phony car trouble.  Ray Walston guest stars in a wonderful performance as a homeless WW2 vet who helps the Camdens all appreciate life more.  And Eric's old rock band trio arrives for a chaotic visit.In disk 3, Mom Annie is more and more pregnant, while Lucy considers having sex (in season 11 she is a wife and loving mother!) and Mary sneaks away to a coed sleepover.  A memorable Christmas episode.  Mary just barely passes her driving test.  And Eric and Annie learn that Dr. Hastings, who almost killed Matt at birth, might deliver the twins.Disk 4 is the biggie on this DVD set.  Twins Sam and David are born in a very poignant and emotional episode with a lovely finale, then come home from the hospital; what a lovely singing voice Beverly Mitchell (Lucy) has in putting the twins to sleep.  And Lucy's ex-boyfriend may be involved with drugs.In disk 5, Eric counsels a couple who want to divorce, while Matt temporarily joins the Army to pay for college.  The college dean is threatened with expulsion after an extra-marital affair.  An aging, but dedicated janitor may have to resign or be fired for age.  And a wonderful dog may have to be put to sleep because (s)he is dying and in pain.Disk 6 is a two hour season finale--one wedding is stopped in the middle, another takes place, and a lot of people reconcile improbably but optimistically for a radiant happy ending.7TH HEAVEN is a TV series gem to highly recommend, present and past.  Again, Sunday night on the CW network, and seasons 1 through 3 on DVD, with season 4 in the wings.  The series is at its zenith in season three.  Kudos, especially, to head writers Brenda Hampton and Sue Tenney; and to a world-class cast.  If Catherine Hicks was not really pregnant in disks 1 through 3 of season three, then she is one of the great actresses; and Stephen Collins seems so like a suburban California minister that one wants to write him with religious concerns.  And again, bouncing back and forth between season 11 live and season 3 on DVD is truly like flipping through a nostalgic family album to cherish.  Season 3 is definitely worth buying to have the entire 22 episode season in one convenient boxed set, uncut and non-commercial, at a reasonable price.",5,The TV family drama at its very finest,1172016000,"02 21, 2007",2007,3982,"['love', '7TH', 'HEAVEN', 'TV', 'longest-running', 'family', 'comedy-drama', 'season', 'eleven', 'going', 'prime', 'time', 'Sunday', 'nights', 'season', 'three', 'DVD', 'season', 'four', 'way', 'was', 'one', 'late', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'crown', 'jewels', 'forty', 'years', 'producing', 'evening', 'TV', 'dramas', 'Brenda', 'Hampton', 'creator', 'still', 'head', 'writer', 'eleven', 'seasons', 'cast', 'just', 'impeccable', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'Catherine', 'Hicks', 'parents', 'Eric', 'Annie', 'Camden', 'descending', 'order', 'five', 'kids', 'Barry', 'Watson', 'college-age', 'Matt', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'basketball', 'lover', 'independent', 'Mary', 'Beverley', 'Mitchell', 'boy-obsessed', 'Lucy', 'David', 'Gallagher', 'teenage', 'Simon', 'Mackenzie', 'Rosman', 'precocious', 'little', 'Ruthie', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'little', 'when', 'boyfriend', 'get', 'tattoos', 'season', '11', '.Watch', 'season', '11', 'prime', 'time', 'Sunday', 'night', 'CW', 'network', 'then', 'put', 'season', 'three', 'DVD', 'episode', 'looking', 'very', 'special', 'family', 'album', 'Were', 'kids', 'ever', 'little', 'Season', 'three', 'am', 'reviewing', 'here', 'wonderful', 'time', 'capsule', 'DVD', 'think', 'like', 'more', 'season', '11', 'Season', '11', 'more', 'sex-obsessed', 'everyone', 'not', 'carefully', 'written', 'season', '3', 'course', 'treat', 'honor', 'have', '22', 'season', '3', 'episodes', 'one', 'convenient', 'DVD', 'uncut', 'non-commercial', 'six', 'disks', 'Conflicts', 'may', 'be', 'resolved', 'too', 'easily', 'show', 'powerful', 'themes', 'superbly', 'acted.Each', 'disk', 'four', 'episodes', 'are', '45', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'disk', '1', 'Annie', 'announces', 'pregnant', 'frat', 'house', 'initiation', 'almost', 'fatal', 'Lucy', 'new', 'girl', 'friend', 'wrist', 'cutter.In', 'disk', '2', 'Matt', 'arrested', 'car', 'stolen', 'helping', 'girl', 'phony', 'car', 'trouble', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'guest', 'stars', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'homeless', 'WW2', 'vet', 'who', 'Camdens', 'appreciate', 'life', 'more', 'Eric', 'old', 'rock', 'band', 'trio', 'chaotic', 'visit.In', 'disk', '3', 'Mom', 'Annie', 'more', 'more', 'pregnant', 'Lucy', 'considers', 'having', 'sex', 'season', '11', 'wife', 'loving', 'mother', 'Mary', 'sneaks', 'away', 'coed', 'sleepover', 'memorable', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'Mary', 'just', 'barely', 'driving', 'test', 'Eric', 'Annie', 'learn', 'Dr.', 'Hastings', 'who', 'almost', 'killed', 'Matt', 'birth', 'might', 'deliver', 'twins.Disk', '4', 'biggie', 'DVD', 'set', 'Twins', 'Sam', 'David', 'are', 'born', 'very', 'poignant', 'emotional', 'episode', 'lovely', 'finale', 'then', 'come', 'home', 'hospital', 'what', 'lovely', 'singing', 'voice', 'Beverly', 'Mitchell', 'Lucy', 'putting', 'twins', 'sleep', 'Lucy', 'ex-boyfriend', 'may', 'be', 'involved', 'drugs.In', 'disk', '5', 'Eric', 'couple', 'who', 'want', 'divorce', 'Matt', 'temporarily', 'Army', 'pay', 'college', 'college', 'dean', 'threatened', 'expulsion', 'extra-marital', 'affair', 'aging', 'dedicated', 'janitor', 'may', 'have', 'resign', 'be', 'fired', 'age', 'wonderful', 'dog', 'may', 'have', 'be', 'put', 'sleep', 's', 'dying', 'pain.Disk', '6', 'two', 'hour', 'season', 'finale', 'one', 'wedding', 'stopped', 'middle', 'place', 'lot', 'people', 'reconcile', 'improbably', 'optimistically', 'radiant', 'happy', 'ending.7TH', 'HEAVEN', 'TV', 'series', 'gem', 'highly', 'recommend', 'present', 'past', 'Again', 'Sunday', 'night', 'CW', 'network', 'seasons', '1', '3', 'DVD', 'season', '4', 'wings', 'series', 'zenith', 'season', 'three', 'Kudos', 'especially', 'head', 'writers', 'Brenda', 'Hampton', 'Sue', 'Tenney', 'world-class', 'cast', 'Catherine', 'Hicks', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'pregnant', 'disks', '1', '3', 'season', 'three', 'then', 'one', 'great', 'actresses', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'so', 'suburban', 'California', 'minister', 'one', 'write', 'religious', 'concerns', 'again', 'bouncing', 'back', 'forth', 'season', '11', 'live', 'season', '3', 'DVD', 'truly', 'like', 'flipping', 'nostalgic', 'family', 'album', 'cherish', 'Season', '3', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buying', 'have', 'entire', '22', 'episode', 'season', 'one', 'convenient', 'boxed', 'set', 'uncut', 'non-commercial', 'reasonable', 'price']",7th Heaven: Season 3
