256814,AQCAWDBNNUS1E,6301586050,A. J. Sneed,"[1, 2]","Romantic comedy in the typical Lubitsch style ( ""sophisticated and subtle""), as true love and marriage at the turn-of-the century endure the incorrigible womanizing of an otherwise ""good man"". Some nice plot devices with Ameche's character  remorsefully recounting his life to the devil as the film begins. Technicolor is a little ""loud"" at times, but it definitely gives a ""lighter"" feel to the film as it evokes the period musicals that were done so commonly at Fox in the 1940s. We don't take any of the characters too seriously in these costumes and sets, and this fits the tone of the movie.Lubitsch's sublety had to work overtime to make a comedic theme out of a philandering husband, and outwit the censorship code. It certainly is skillful and effective ( we are never in doubt what the husband's failings really are), but the ""subtlety""  does lose some of its charmas the film wears on.The cast is led by Don Ameche and Gene Tierney as the married couple whose life we follow. Ameche had done romantic comedy successfully before ( ""Midnight"" with Claudette Colbert), and is cast well in this role. Gene Tierney is up to the task of her character, although her performance does not particularly stand out. As is often the case, it is the supporting cast that provides most of the humour and best lines in the film. Charles Coburn, Eugene Pallete, Allyn Joslyn, Spring Byington and Marjorie Main, all well- known character actors, keep the comedy alive as supporting players.However, the ""Lubitsch touch"" seems to wane about 2/3 through this movie. As many of the fine character actors' parts leave the film, the quick wit and snappy dialogue depart with them, and the pace slows considerably. The implied premise and innuendo of infidelity  becomes a little dull and overextended. The movie then drags on for about 20 minutes too long as it tries to find a suitable ending for Ameche's character.All in all a worthwhile film, although it seems that Lubitsch's sophisticated and subtle humor does not seem so clever as it did 10 years earlier in his career. Perhaps, its the backdrop of  ""Old World"" manners that is a little stale by 1943.For those who like romantic comedies and find this style of humor a little ""stilted"", I would recommend ""The More the Merrier"", a film which came out around the same time. It's a more ""screwball"" style, but done with a light touch.",4,"Clever dialogue and nice cast, but runs out of steam",1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,2377,"['Romantic', 'comedy', 'typical', 'Lubitsch', 'style', 'sophisticated', 'subtle', 'true', 'love', 'marriage', 'turn-of-the', 'century', 'endure', 'incorrigible', 'womanizing', 'otherwise', 'good', 'man', 'nice', 'plot', 'devices', 'Ameche', 'character', 'remorsefully', 'recounting', 'life', 'devil', 'film', 'Technicolor', 'little', 'loud', 'times', 'definitely', 'lighter', 'feel', 'film', 'period', 'musicals', 'were', 'done', 'so', 'commonly', 'Fox', '1940s', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'characters', 'too', 'seriously', 'costumes', 'sets', 'tone', 'movie.Lubitsch', 'sublety', 'had', 'work', 'overtime', 'make', 'comedic', 'theme', 'philandering', 'husband', 'censorship', 'code', 'certainly', 'skillful', 'effective', 'are', 'never', 'doubt', 'what', 'husband', 'failings', 'really', 'are', 'subtlety', 'lose', 'charmas', 'film', 'cast', 'led', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'married', 'couple', 'life', 'follow', 'Ameche', 'had', 'done', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'successfully', 'before', 'Midnight', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'cast', 'well', 'role', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'up', 'task', 'character', 'performance', 'not', 'particularly', 'stand', 'out', 'often', 'case', 'supporting', 'cast', 'most', 'humour', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'Eugene', 'Pallete', 'Allyn', 'Joslyn', 'Spring', 'Byington', 'Marjorie', 'Main', 'well-', 'known', 'character', 'actors', 'keep', 'comedy', 'alive', 'supporting', 'players.However', 'Lubitsch', 'touch', 'wane', '2/3', 'movie', 'many', 'fine', 'character', 'actors', 'parts', 'leave', 'film', 'quick', 'wit', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'depart', 'pace', 'considerably', 'implied', 'premise', 'innuendo', 'infidelity', 'little', 'dull', 'overextended', 'movie', 'then', '20', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'find', 'suitable', 'ending', 'Ameche', 'character.All', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'Lubitsch', 'sophisticated', 'subtle', 'humor', 'not', 'seem', 'so', 'clever', 'did', '10', 'years', 'earlier', 'career', 'Perhaps', 'backdrop', 'Old', 'World', 'manners', 'little', 'stale', '1943.For', 'who', 'like', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'find', 'style', 'humor', 'little', 'stilted', 'would', 'recommend', 'More', 'Merrier', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'more', 'screwball', 'style', 'done', 'light', 'touch']",N/A

And so, philosophically, he presented himself where innumerable people had so often told him to go.""Henry (Don Ameche) is greeted courteously by His Excellency (Laird Cregar). ""I presume your funeral was satisfactory?"" the devil asks. ""Well...there was a lot of crying,"" Henry says, ""so I believe everybody had a good time."" His Excellency explains that while he will consider Henry's request, there must be good reasons to avoid going Up There. ""If you meet our requirements, we'll be only too glad to accommodate you. Would you be kind enough to mention, for instance, some outstanding crime you've committed "" ""Crime...crime...I'm afraid I can't think of any,"" Henry says. ""But I can safely say my whole life was one continuous misdemeanor.""Heaven Can Wait is the witty, nostalgic, gentle and surprisingly thoughtful tale of Henry Van Cleve, philanderer, wealthy lay-about and a man far from noble. Under Ernst Lubitsch's direction and with Samson Raphaelson's screenplay, Heaven Can Wait is, as critic Andrew Sarris says, ""a hidden masterpiece.""His Excellency is intrigued and asks Henry to tell him his story. Henry believes that he can do this only through the women in his life, and, in one linear flashback, he does, starting as a babe in a bassinet. Henry loves women, he loves the pursuit, he loves the pleasures of the chase, the theater, the champagne, the supper clubs. He's spoiled, he's optimistic, he's endlessly inventive in finding ways out of being discovered. He may be innocently selfish, but it's in an almost childlike way. ""Oh, Henry,"" his wife, Martha (Gene Tierney), says to him after being exasperated once too often, ""I know your every move. I know your outraged indignation. I know the poor weeping little boy. I know the misunderstood, strong, silent man, the worn-out lion who is too proud to explain what happened in the jungle last night.""Henry had eloped with Martha the day he met her, under the nose of her fiance, his cousin Albert (Allyn Joslyn), a straight-laced lawyer who believes ""marriage isn't a series of thrills. Marriage is a peaceful, well-balanced adjustment of two right-thinking people."" Henry loves Martha deeply, but can't resist a beautiful face or a well-turned leg. Even as a widower, with a grown son, his old habits remain a part of his character. Yet he is so likeable and charming, Henry Van Cleve rarely hurts anyone.After listening to Henry's story and despite all of Henry's tales of waywardness, His Excellency sends him on his way...but in an elevator going up, not down. He tells Henry, you'll find many people up there who love you and have been waiting for you. They will intercede for you...because despite everything you made people very happy.This is a delightful movie that must have seemed either a relief or irrelevant to it's time. It was made in 1943 and was popular, yet it ostensibly is about nothing much at all. The setting is the 1870's through the start of the 1940's. There is no reference to any outside forces in Henry's life, no World War I, no Great Depression, no rise of fascism, no moral messages. Yet as the movie goes on we meet characters we come to either find amusing or to like, or both, and they disappear from the screen. Their time has passed and, out of sight, they've died while Henry's story continues. I was left, almost without realizing it, feeling optimistic and a little sad. Life does pass us by, and it's best savored by enjoying life without damaging others.Among these characters are Henry's grandfather (Charles Coburn), irascible and secretly (and not so secretly) envious of Henry's outlook on life; Henry's father and mother, played by Louis Calhern and Spring Byington, obliviously stern and clueless and loving and clueless, respectively; and Mabel's parents from Kansas, played by Eugene Pallette and Marjorie Main, who have a great Sunday breakfast scene battling over the comic pages while their butler is the intermediary. Laird Cregar, only 29 when he made this movie and dead little more than a year later, brings great, amused authority to the role of His Excellency. Gene Tierney with her overbite was never more luscious. She did a skilled job as Mabel, loving Henry, understanding of his ways but only willing up to a point to be tolerant. The movie, however, is Don Ameche's. He might have been a bland actor, but he is just about perfect as Henry Van Cleve, well-intentioned, charming, constantly tempted and often frustrated.The movie seems to me to be just about a perfect collaboration between director Lubitsch and writer Raphaelson. They had collaborated earlier on two other great movies, the incomparable Trouble in Paradise and The Shop Around the Corner. Trouble in Paradise has one of the most amusing screenplays you can find, and Lubitsch brought to it all the urbanity and style he was known for. If you could choose only one Lubitsch movie to own, I'd unhesitatingly say to make it Trouble in Paradise. But I think Heaven Can Wait would be second choice.The Criterion DVD features a sumptuous picture transfer with rich color. The extras include a discussion of the film by movie critics Andrew Sarris and Molly Haskell and an interview with Raphaelson by Bill Moyers. The case has an informative brochure with an essay about Lubitsch and the film.",5,"A witty, humane, thoughtful movie directed by Ernst Lubitsch and written by Samson Raphaelson",1154736000,"08 5,

256821,A1GQQFTPA23Z1O,6301586050,Dave,"[65, 68]","At last, this timeless romantic comedy has gotten the Criterion ""treatment"" and is being released on dvd. Don Ameche stars as Henry Van Cleve, an over-the-hill former playboy who has died and gone to Hell. But Satan, or ""His Excellency"" (Laird Cregar, giving one of his very best performances!) isn't convinced that Van Cleeve belongs there, so Henry tells him the story of his life (through flashbacks of course).Growing up a Van Cleeve wasn't easy, and young Henry had no one to turn to for help (both his parents are somewhat out of touch with reality!) except his wild grandfather (Charles Coburn), who is obviously not a very good role model for Henry. As Henry becomes a man, he starts pursuing young and beautiful women, and finally meets a respectable young lady, Martha (Gene Tierney). The problem is that Martha is already engaged to a relative of Henry's! But, he wins her over and they elope and begin their life together.After ten years of marriage, Martha walks out on Henry because of his flirtations with other women. With the help of his granfather, Henry finally convinces her to come back to him, and somehow they manage to stay married. Eventually, in an ironic twist of fate, middle-aged Henry finds his son facing the same problem with women (he can't stop chasing them!) that he suffered with for decades. Henry and Martha's bond together gets only closer as they grow older together, but sadly death seperates them...but only temporarily. Needless to say, after hearing the story of Henry's life, His Excellency knows that Van Cleeve belongs with Martha in Heaven!This wonderful Ernst Lubitsch film from 1943 is a bold-for-its-time look at marriage and infidelity, and the fast-paced script is packed with witty dialogue. Don Ameche plays a cad, true, but he does it with such charm, humor, and sophistication that you can't help but like him. And of course, the beautiful Gene Tierney in technicolor is not something to be missed by any movie buff! The supporting cast was equally superb, especially Charles Coburn and Laird Cregar, whose film career was sadly cut short by a fatal heart attack at the age of 28. With a great mixture of romance, humor, and drama, this excellent classic is highly recommended.",5,"""A passport to Hell is not issued on generalities.""",1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,2234,"['last', 'timeless', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'gotten', 'Criterion', 'treatment', 'being', 'released', 'dvd', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'Henry', 'Van', 'Cleve', 'over-the-hill', 'former', 'playboy', 'who', 'died', 'gone', 'Hell', 'Satan', 'Excellency', 'Laird', 'Cregar', 'giving', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'performances', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'Van', 'Cleeve', 'there', 'Henry', 'story', 'life', 'flashbacks', 'course', '.Growing', 'up', 'Van', 'Cleeve', 'was', ""n't"", 'easy', 'young', 'Henry', 'had', 'one', 'turn', 'help', 'parents', 'are', 'somewhat', 'touch', 'reality', 'wild', 'grandfather', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'who', 'obviously', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'model', 'Henry', 'Henry', 'man', 'pursuing', 'young', 'beautiful', 'women', 'finally', 'respectable', 'young', 'lady', 'Martha', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'problem', 'Martha', 'already', 'engaged', 'relative', 'Henry', 'over', 'elope', 'begin', 'life', 'together.After', 'ten', 'years', 'marriage', 'Martha', 'out', 'Henry', 'flirtations', 'other', 'women', 'help', 'granfather', 'Henry', 'finally', 'come', 'back', 'somehow', 'manage', 'stay', 'married', 'Eventually', 'ironic', 'twist', 'fate', 'middle-aged', 'Henry', 'son', 'facing', 'same', 'problem', 'women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'chasing', 'suffered', 'decades', 'Henry', 'Martha', 'bond', 'together', 'only', 'closer', 'grow', 'older', 'together', 'sadly', 'death', 'only', 'temporarily', 'Needless', 'say', 'hearing', 'story', 'Henry', 'life', 'Excellency', 'Van', 'Cleeve', 'Martha', 'Heaven', 'wonderful', 'Ernst', 'Lubitsch', 'film', '1943', 'bold-for-its-time', 'look', 'marriage', 'infidelity', 'fast-paced', 'script', 'packed', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'cad', 'true', 'such', 'charm', 'humor', 'sophistication', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'course', 'beautiful', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'technicolor', 'not', 'something', 'be', 'missed', 'movie', 'buff', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'equally', 'superb', 'especially', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'Laird', 'Cregar', 'film', 'career', 'was', 'sadly', 'cut', 'short', 'fatal', 'heart', 'attack', 'age', '28', 'great', 'mixture', 'romance', 'humor', 'drama', 'excellent', 'classic', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Maybe the American public needed a break from the news, because there is no hint whatever of anything at all of international importance or concern, even incidentally, in the plot or script.Others have covered the plot. Gene Tierney is a treasure, but there was no chemistry whatever between her character and her &#34;little Casanova&#34; husband, Henry Van Cleve. A crucial point in the movie is when she discovers his apparently constant and casual adultery, and leaves him. He chases her down, only to use revolting, manipulative, self-pitying &#34;How could you do this to me? You can't imagine what I've suffered! I guess I'll leave since you'll never take me back&#34; and so forth to try to get her back. No apology, growth, self-examination or reform occurs in his shallow character. Or in hers - she goes back, and they both later see that their son has grown up to be just like Daddy.The scenes in Hell that others found so charming were disturbing to me in a really bad way. Hell is presented as an austere, upscale corporate headquarters with a somewhat uncomfortable basement. &#34;His excellency&#34; is scripted as an urbane, sympathetic figure - almost like a wealthy, bureaucratic uncle. He finds the same people annoying that we do, and shares our sympathies - dropping a simpering, self-satisfied middle-aged woman down into fire and brimstone while smiling benignly and telling Mr. Van Cleve that anything less than front-page crime is just not enough to gain admission into Hell. What did the simpering lady do? Murder a township? When he regretfully suggests Mr. Van Cleve try heaven after all, he seems glad for him. This is watered-down evil at it's worst, patting Mr. Van Cleve and the audience on the back, validating that incredible, life-long, catastrophic self-interest, using some women for sex while lying to the wife to whom he vowed love, loyalty and fidelity, is really no big deal. The larger message is that it's fine to do what's &#34;natural&#34; ( a line used in the movie ), we'll still get to heaven because we're not truly evil enough for Hell. Moreover, Satan is our friend and on our side, so of course he'll reject us and smile wistfully as we go &#34;up&#34;.Whereas, if Satan exists, it would be far more appropriate to view him as a lethal and sickening wasp, attacking with tireless and sentient malice until his victim's soul is dead. As was Mr. Van Cleve's, who did indeed qualify for Hell -  not because of his life being &#34;one long misdemeanor&#34;, but because of his ultimately willing alliance with the works of that same benign-seeming, uncle-like figure.I'm not trying to preach, but this is how the movies struck me. And since I can see today where cute philosophical re-shapings of important matters to suit our temporary satisfactions has led, I can't like it.So for all of that, and because it was stage-y, almost burlesque, and had no chemistry, I rate it very low. I avoided giving it a one-star because Gene Tierney's star power deserved a star, and because the story and execution weren't openly malicious in intent - it was meant to be light entertainment, and did succeed, whatever the ultimate result.",2,Not on board with the glowing reviews for this one.,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,3894,"['could', 'tell', 'very', 'quickly', 'was', 'based', 'play', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'were', 'very', 'very', 'stage-y', 'were', 'performances', 'Not', 'was', 'enough', 'rate', 'low', 'Nothing', 'production', 'was', 'really', 'excellent', 'even', 'very', 'good', 'Even', 'period', 'piece', '1940', 'little', 'offer', 'almost', 'burlesque', 'light', 'film', 'ultimately', 'nothing', 'really', 'very', 'wrong', 'habitual', 'adultery', 'lying', 'using', 'catastrophically', 'selfish', 'manipulation', 'make', 'sure', 'spouse', 'nothing', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'behaviour', 'leaving.This', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1943', '1943', 'WWII', 'was', '4th', 'year', 'United', 'States', 'nearly', 'European', 'power', 'was', 'involved', 'Maybe', 'American', 'public', 'needed', 'break', 'news', 'hint', 'whatever', 'anything', 'international', 'importance', 'concern', 'even', 'incidentally', 'plot', 'script.Others', 'have', 'covered', 'plot', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'treasure', 'was', 'chemistry', 'character', '34', 'little', 'Casanova', '34', 'husband', 'Henry', 'Van', 'Cleve', 'crucial', 'point', 'movie', 'when', 'apparently', 'constant', 'casual', 'adultery', 'down', 'only', 'use', 'revolting', 'manipulative', 'self-pitying', '34', 'How', 'could', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', ""'ve"", 'suffered', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'leave', ""'ll"", 'never', 'take', 'back', '34', 'so', 'forth', 'try', 'get', 'back', 'apology', 'growth', 'self-examination', 'reform', 'shallow', 'character', 'hers', 'back', 'later', 'see', 'son', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'just', 'Daddy.The', 'scenes', 'Hell', 'others', 'found', 'so', 'charming', 'were', 'disturbing', 'really', 'bad', 'way', 'Hell', 'presented', 'austere', 'upscale', 'corporate', 'headquarters', 'somewhat', 'uncomfortable', 'basement', '34', 'excellency', '34', 'scripted', 'urbane', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'almost', 'wealthy', 'bureaucratic', 'uncle', 'same', 'people', 'annoying', 'do', 'shares', 'sympathies', 'dropping', 'simpering', 'self-satisfied', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'down', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'smiling', 'benignly', 'telling', 'Mr.', 'Van', 'Cleve', 'anything', 'less', 'front-page', 'crime', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'gain', 'admission', 'Hell', 'What', 'did', 'simpering', 'lady', 'do', 'Murder', 'township', 'When', 'regretfully', 'Mr.', 'Van', 'Cleve', 'try', 'heaven', 'glad', 'watered-down', 'evil', 'worst', 'patting', 'Mr.', 'Van', 'Cleve', 'audience', 'back', 'validating', 'incredible', 'life-long', 'catastrophic', 'self-interest', 'using', 'women', 'sex', 'lying', 'wife', 'whom', 'vowed', 'love', 'loyalty', 'fidelity', 'really', 'big', 'deal', 'larger', 'message', 'fine', 'do', 'what', '34', 'natural', '34', 'line', 'used', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'still', 'get', 'heaven', ""'re"", 'not', 'truly', 'evil', 'enough', 'Hell', 'Moreover', 'Satan', 'friend', 'side', 'course', ""'ll"", 'reject', 'smile', 'wistfully', 'go', '34', 'up', '34', '.Whereas', 'Satan', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'appropriate', 'view', 'lethal', 'sickening', 'wasp', 'attacking', 'tireless', 'sentient', 'malice', 'victim', 'soul', 'dead', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Van', 'Cleve', 'who', 'did', 'indeed', 'qualify', 'Hell', 'not', 'life', 'being', '34', 'one', 'long', 'misdemeanor', '34', 'ultimately', 'willing', 'alliance', 'works', 'same', 'benign-seeming', 'uncle-like', 'figure.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'preach', 'how', 'movies', 'struck', 'can', 'see', 'today', 'where', 'cute', 'philosophical', 're-shapings', 'important', 'matters', 'suit', 'temporary', 'satisfactions', 'led', 'ca', ""n't"", 'like', 'it.So', 'was', 'stage-y', 'almost', 'burlesque', 'had', 'chemistry', 'rate', 'very', 'low', 'avoided', 'giving', 'one-star', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'star', 'power', 'deserved', 'star', 'story', 'execution', 'were', ""n't"", 'openly', 'malicious', 'intent', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'light', 'entertainment', 'did', 'succeed', 'whatever', 'ultimate', 'result']",N/A
256823,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,6301586050,Douglas M,"[14, 14]","This was Don Ameche's finest film. For once, he had a first rate director and script and a chance to take the centre stage in a comedy. He plays a lifelong flirt who, in spite of his love for his wife, can't help himself when he encounters a pretty woman. Whether it be due to the Production Code or otherwise, his actions are very genteel and neither the audience nor his wife take him very seriously but his charm and humour create a warm and funny character.All the other actors shine in their roles. Gene Tierney is subtle, versatile and graceful as Ameche's wife. It is a mystery to me why she is sometimes singled out as mediocre. She has some very complex dialogue which she delivers faultlessly, her timing is excellent and she ages very convincingly. Charles Coburn as grandpa has the best lines, Signe Hasso as a French maid steals every scene in which she appears and Eugene Pallete as Tierney's father-in-law, Mr Strable, is very funny. There is a memorable scene between Pallette and harridan wife Marjorie Main at their breakfast table which ranks as one of the funniest scenes ever. The great Laird Cregar creates a superbly ambiguous and attractive devil and lastly, special mention of Allyn Joslyn as cousin Albert. Watch his straight back and smug grins. This is brilliant comic acting.Two criticisms - the film sags after the Gene Tierney character dies and the 1940s styled lacquered cuties who appear make us long for Tierney's grace and poise. Samson Raphaelson, who wrote the film, comments on how the film loses momentum at this point in his interviews. Finally,the wig which Tierney wears as a middle aged woman is just plain weird.The DVD offers a perfect print with glorious Fox technicolour, overstuffed sets and the usual high standard of photography. The extras focus mainly on the director Ernst Lubitsch and the writer Samson Raphaelson. First off is a discussion of the film by 2 critics. While they are able to provide some interesting background information, they tend to interrupt each other and come across as eager fans rather than commentators. The effect was irritating. Molly Haskell, in particular, is pretentious, always looking for a feminist angle if possible.The interviews with Samson Raphaelson are unusual. One of the interviews is really a lecture to film students so you have to concentrate hard to follow his train of thought. His comments are at their best when he dismisses loaded questions about the motivation of Lubitsch and himself e.g. Lubitsch's use of doors. As Raphaelson says, if an actor leaves a set, it is 99% likely to be through a door - end of discussion!There is also a charming monologue from Lubitsch's daughter about growing up in a house full of music. This is followed by some wonderful photos from her personal albums with some accompanying tunes played by Lubitsch himself on the piano. The music is upbeat and in combination with the photos, you get a very personal insight into their lives. She has also provided a copy of the film's original pressbook which is dry and ironic in the best Lubitsch sense.Overall, this is another excellent comprehensive Criterion package which would have been improved by a good commentary to replace that dumb conversation between the film critics.",4,"Perfectly made, brilliant script",1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,3261,"['was', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'finest', 'film', 'once', 'had', 'first', 'rate', 'director', 'script', 'chance', 'take', 'centre', 'stage', 'comedy', 'lifelong', 'flirt', 'who', 'spite', 'love', 'wife', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'when', 'pretty', 'woman', 'be', 'due', 'Production', 'Code', 'otherwise', 'actions', 'are', 'very', 'genteel', 'audience', 'wife', 'take', 'very', 'seriously', 'charm', 'humour', 'create', 'warm', 'funny', 'character.All', 'other', 'actors', 'shine', 'roles', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'subtle', 'versatile', 'graceful', 'Ameche', 'wife', 'mystery', 'why', 'sometimes', 'singled', 'out', 'mediocre', 'very', 'complex', 'dialogue', 'faultlessly', 'timing', 'excellent', 'very', 'convincingly', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'grandpa', 'best', 'lines', 'Signe', 'Hasso', 'French', 'maid', 'steals', 'scene', 'Eugene', 'Pallete', 'Tierney', 'father-in-law', 'Mr', 'Strable', 'very', 'funny', 'memorable', 'scene', 'Pallette', 'harridan', 'wife', 'Marjorie', 'Main', 'breakfast', 'table', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'ever', 'great', 'Laird', 'Cregar', 'superbly', 'ambiguous', 'attractive', 'devil', 'lastly', 'special', 'mention', 'Allyn', 'Joslyn', 'cousin', 'Albert', 'Watch', 'straight', 'back', 'smug', 'grins', 'brilliant', 'comic', 'acting.Two', 'criticisms', 'film', 'sags', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'character', 'dies', '1940s', 'styled', 'lacquered', 'cuties', 'who', 'appear', 'make', 'long', 'Tierney', 'grace', 'poise', 'Samson', 'Raphaelson', 'who', 'wrote', 'film', 'comments', 'how', 'film', 'momentum', 'point', 'interviews', 'Finally', 'wig', 'Tierney', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'just', 'plain', 'weird.The', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'print', 'glorious', 'Fox', 'technicolour', 'overstuffed', 'sets', 'usual', 'high', 'standard', 'photography', 'extras', 'focus', 'mainly', 'director', 'Ernst', 'Lubitsch', 'writer', 'Samson', 'Raphaelson', 'First', 'off', 'discussion', 'film', '2', 'critics', 'are', 'able', 'provide', 'interesting', 'background', 'information', 'tend', 'interrupt', 'other', 'come', 'eager', 'fans', 'rather', 'commentators', 'effect', 'was', 'irritating', 'Molly', 'Haskell', 'particular', 'pretentious', 'always', 'looking', 'feminist', 'angle', 'possible.The', 'interviews', 'Samson', 'Raphaelson', 'are', 'unusual', 'One', 'interviews', 'really', 'lecture', 'film', 'students', 'have', 'concentrate', 'hard', 'follow', 'train', 'thought', 'comments', 'are', 'best', 'when', 'loaded', 'questions', 'motivation', 'Lubitsch', 'e.g', 'Lubitsch', 'use', 'doors', 'Raphaelson', 'actor', 'set', '99', '%', 'likely', 'be', 'door', 'end', 'discussion', 'also', 'charming', 'monologue', 'Lubitsch', 'daughter', 'growing', 'up', 'house', 'full', 'music', 'followed', 'wonderful', 'photos', 'personal', 'albums', 'accompanying', 'tunes', 'played', 'Lubitsch', 'piano', 'music', 'upbeat', 'combination', 'photos', 'get', 'very', 'personal', 'insight', 'lives', 'also', 'provided', 'copy', 'film', 'original', 'pressbook', 'dry', 'ironic', 'best', 'Lubitsch', 'sense.Overall', 'excellent', 'comprehensive', 'Criterion', 'package', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'good', 'commentary', 'replace', 'dumb', 'conversation', 'film', 'critics']",N/A
256824,A1QJC4OTICYGJY,6301586050,D. Parisi,"[4, 4]","There are no pratfalls, slaps or screams, but what Heaven Can Wait lacks in low comedy it more than makes up for with charm, wit, elegance and grace. It may be one of America's most under-rated comedies for that very reason: it is rarely laugh-out-loud hilarious. Rather, it is nostalgic, creative and quite sophisticated, an entirely different kind of comedy, and another prime example of the Lubitsch Touch.The story concerns Henry Van Cleve, recently deceased, who presents himself at the Gates of Hell, where ""His Excellency"" (presumably Satan or another one of the Hades' head honchos) must decide whether or not to admit him. Henry has come to the place where ""so many people had told him to go"" because he feels he has lived a life of sin. ""His Excellency"" asks Henry to describe just why he feels he qualifies for entry, and, via flashback, we get the story of his life.As the film proceeds, we witness several birthdays throughout Henry's life, spanning his childhood through his death. Each episode faithfully recreates a bygone era, with some of the most subtle touches ever committed to film. Nothing ever calls attention to itself here, and every time you watch this picture, you'll see another delightful nuance you've never before noticed. Perhaps my favorite touch is the ""disappearance"" of one supporting character at each new birthday, indicating that in the years between the last birthday, a family member has passed away. Lubitsch even manages to make death into something sophisticated and witty.As his life unfolds before our eyes, we realize that Henry has actually lived quite an average life, with everyday problems, everyday joys and everyday loves. It seems his self-image of an evil rou&eacute; might be just a little inflated. He likes to think of himself as a bad boy, but he has lived a decent life, been a good father and become a beloved husband.Heaven Can Wait is a film of small pleasures and suprises, and it is a complete joy to behold. It's really indescribable just how charming the film is; you simply have to see it. Lubitsch was a master of his craft, and he is at his peak here. Admittedly, the film is not as widely-appealing or well-known as Ninotchka, The Shop Around the Corner, To Be or Not To Be or Trouble in Paradise. Those films are all more obviously funny. But this is one of those rare comedies that can give you a lump in your throat and make you appreciate the fragility and beauty of life. I suppose you still have to label it a comedy, but it's more witty than funny.Aside from Lubitsch, the film has several other people who greatly contribute to its success. Of course there is Don Ameche, who carries the film effortlessly from beginning to end. It would be a crime not to give him credit for his magnificent characterization. The always-lovely Gene Tierney also turns in a wonderful performance, developping her character as the decades wear on. Her Martha is one of the most endearing female characters in the Lubitsch canon.Laird Cregar (who died tragically of a heart attack at 28 years old the following year) truly shines as ""His Excellency."" Although he merely bookends the film and only has about 8 minutes of screentime, his performance is a perfect example of how an actor can turn even the smallest part into greatness. It's one of cinema's all-time greatest supporting roles. Signe Hasso has a featured spot as the naughty French maid known simply as ""Mademoiselle."" And the other family members are all memorably played as well.The color cinematography is stunning, especially in the Criterion transfer. There are no brash colors screaming for attention; it's more as if an old tinted photograph of Old New York has somehow come to life. Subtlety is the word of the day in every part of this film. It doesn't try to grab attention, and, for better or for worse, it rarely gets any, neither from movie historians nor fans. Although it was a major success upon its release, and was even nominated for the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars in 1943, it has quietly slipped into the background of the moviegoing conscience. It seems quite content to sit in the shadow of Lubitsch's other films, appreciated by the few who love it. But in all, this is a perfect little comedy. I'd highly suggest giving it an attentive screening or two.",5,A Quietly Beautiful Comedy,1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,4310,"['are', 'pratfalls', 'slaps', 'screams', 'what', 'Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait', 'lacks', 'low', 'comedy', 'more', 'up', 'charm', 'wit', 'elegance', 'grace', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'under-rated', 'comedies', 'very', 'reason', 'rarely', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hilarious', 'Rather', 'nostalgic', 'creative', 'quite', 'sophisticated', 'entirely', 'different', 'kind', 'comedy', 'prime', 'example', 'Lubitsch', 'Touch.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'Henry', 'Van', 'Cleve', 'recently', 'deceased', 'who', 'Gates', 'Hell', 'where', 'Excellency', 'presumably', 'Satan', 'one', 'Hades', 'head', 'honchos', 'must', 'decide', 'not', 'admit', 'Henry', 'come', 'place', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'had', 'told', 'go', 'lived', 'life', 'sin', 'Excellency', 'Henry', 'describe', 'just', 'why', 'entry', 'flashback', 'get', 'story', 'life.As', 'film', 'proceeds', 'witness', 'several', 'birthdays', 'Henry', 'life', 'spanning', 'childhood', 'death', 'episode', 'faithfully', 'bygone', 'era', 'most', 'subtle', 'touches', 'ever', 'committed', 'film', 'Nothing', 'ever', 'attention', 'here', 'time', 'watch', 'picture', ""'ll"", 'see', 'delightful', 'nuance', ""'ve"", 'never', 'before', 'noticed', 'Perhaps', 'favorite', 'touch', 'disappearance', 'one', 'supporting', 'character', 'new', 'birthday', 'indicating', 'years', 'last', 'birthday', 'family', 'member', 'passed', 'away', 'Lubitsch', 'even', 'make', 'death', 'something', 'sophisticated', 'witty.As', 'life', 'unfolds', 'eyes', 'realize', 'Henry', 'actually', 'lived', 'average', 'life', 'everyday', 'problems', 'everyday', 'joys', 'everyday', 'loves', 'self-image', 'evil', 'rou', 'eacute', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'little', 'inflated', 'think', 'bad', 'boy', 'lived', 'decent', 'life', 'been', 'good', 'father', 'become', 'beloved', 'husband.Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait', 'film', 'small', 'pleasures', 'suprises', 'complete', 'joy', 'behold', 'really', 'indescribable', 'just', 'how', 'charming', 'film', 'simply', 'have', 'see', 'Lubitsch', 'was', 'master', 'craft', 'peak', 'here', 'Admittedly', 'film', 'not', 'widely-appealing', 'well-known', 'Ninotchka', 'Shop', 'Corner', 'Be', 'Not', 'Be', 'Trouble', 'Paradise', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'obviously', 'funny', 'one', 'rare', 'comedies', 'can', 'give', 'lump', 'throat', 'make', 'appreciate', 'fragility', 'beauty', 'life', 'suppose', 'still', 'have', 'label', 'comedy', 'more', 'witty', 'funny.Aside', 'Lubitsch', 'film', 'several', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'greatly', 'contribute', 'success', 'course', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'who', 'film', 'effortlessly', 'beginning', 'end', 'would', 'be', 'crime', 'not', 'give', 'credit', 'magnificent', 'characterization', 'always-lovely', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'also', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'developping', 'character', 'decades', 'wear', 'Martha', 'one', 'most', 'endearing', 'female', 'characters', 'Lubitsch', 'canon.Laird', 'Cregar', 'who', 'died', 'tragically', 'heart', 'attack', '28', 'years', 'old', 'following', 'year', 'truly', 'Excellency', 'merely', 'film', 'only', '8', 'minutes', 'screentime', 'performance', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'actor', 'can', 'turn', 'even', 'smallest', 'part', 'greatness', 'one', 'cinema', 'all-time', 'greatest', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Signe', 'Hasso', 'featured', 'spot', 'naughty', 'French', 'maid', 'known', 'simply', 'Mademoiselle', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'memorably', 'played', 'well.The', 'color', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'especially', 'Criterion', 'transfer', 'are', 'brash', 'colors', 'screaming', 'attention', 'more', 'old', 'tinted', 'photograph', 'Old', 'New', 'York', 'somehow', 'come', 'life', 'Subtlety', 'word', 'day', 'part', 'film', ""n't"", 'try', 'grab', 'attention', 'better', 'worse', 'rarely', 'movie', 'historians', 'fans', 'was', 'major', 'success', 'release', 'was', 'even', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oscars', '1943', 'quietly', 'slipped', 'background', 'moviegoing', 'conscience', 'quite', 'content', 'sit', 'shadow', 'Lubitsch', 'other', 'films', 'appreciated', 'few', 'who', 'love', 'perfect', 'little', 'comedy', ""'d"", 'highly', 'suggest', 'giving', 'attentive', 'screening', 'two']",N/A

Ninotchka it's not!I bought the movie to see Gene Tierney in one of her first big roles, and she is wasted in curiously unattractive clothing with platitudes for dialogue.  She is not helped by the miscasting of Don Ameche as a romantic lothario - he has little affect to his personality, and is definitely not leading man material.  I could not believe for a minute that he was a ladies man.  Cornel Wilde or Cary Grant would have been more believable.And why is this a Criterion Film? Beats me.

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[1, 2]","IN A NUTSHELL: WONDERFULLY SIMPLE STORY WITH STRONG PLOT AND ACTING THROUGHOUTLooking back [no-pun intended] this story 'seems' rather formula-matic, but this was filmed in 1943, and ""Citizen Kane"" released two years earlier had just pioneered the effective use of dramatization through video flashbacks. So, through a series of flashbacks beginning with infancy, ""Heaven Can Wait"" uses the easily understood method of chronological flashbacks to tell the life story of Henry Van Cleve [Don Ameche]. His location is hell's lobby, his audience is the devil, and his objective is to qualify, through the retelling of his own misdeeds, for placement in hell for eternity. The viewpoint Henry assumes, is to illustrate to the devil, played by Laird Cregar, that he belongs in hell now that he has died, a place he says many people had told him to go to, and often.BUT THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS: HENRY IS INDEED LIKE HIS GRANDPA - BUT ....Through the retelling of Henry's misdeeds, with large time gaps between chapters in the stages of his life, we just don't see how he could possibly qualify for entrance to hell and niether does his excellency the devil. The meanness, cruelty and lack of ethics that would seem necessary and relevant to his argument to gain entry to hell are really lacking.In all but the last 3 chapters, when Henry is 50, 60 and finally 70, grandpa is a present and powerful ally to Henry in all his misdeeds. Perhaps, the very likable grandfather [Charles Coburn] is much more akin to Henry than Henry thinks. The only real difference between the plucky grandfather and his gregarious grandson is the wisdom that the senior has aquired over a very long lifespan. So here are the first solid clues that Henry does not belong in hell, because if he belongs in hell so does grandpa and grandpa simply doesn't.IN THE END: THIS DEVIL TURNS OUT TO BE A FAIR JUDGE OF CHARACTER!It seems as we go on deeper into the story of Henry's life that the outcome is spiritually inevitable -- a placement in pergatory for a few centuries is pretty much what his excellency has in mind.ABOUT THE ACTORS - PRODUCTION TEAM - AWARDSDon Ameche - Henry Van Cleve [Lived his life on charm, he needs no intro!]Gene Tierney - Martha [delightful exotic and fragile beauty embodies faithful unconditional love for Henry.]Charles Coburn - Hugo Van Cleve [scene stealing grandfather and spunky role model for Henry.

256835,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6301586050,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[0, 3]","The actions of a man define the character and in the Christian belief this character will come under judgment upon the day of the last breath.  The verdict based on character can only bring a person in one of two directions.  These directions are, according to common Christian belief, either up or down.  Up refers to entering heaven while down brings the person to a scorching situation related to infinite pain.  Most people are aware of their actions, but many remain blind to the consequences of their actions.  Nonetheless, there are people who have courage to stand up straight and take what they deserve.  Henry Van Cleve (Don Ameche) is such a man, who is rather sure about his destination, as he simply takes the stairs down and walks up to the the Devil (Laird Cregar) himself and calls him, ""His Excellency.""Ernst Lubitsch's tale of Henry who enters the His Excellency's domain while the Devil inquires what he can do for him.  After a brief run-in with an acquaintance from the past His Excellency becomes curious about Henry's past, as he also lacks knowledge of Henry's identity.  Thus, Henry begins his biography, which he shares with the His Excellency in the light of all the women in his life.  The story begins with his mother and grandmother who began quarrelling about when and how much affection to give him as an infant.  Henry continues to tell how he kept on running into women through his childhood and adolescence.  All of the women were treated with affectionate and tender care while he kept his physical distance in order maintain the fashionable moral conduct of the 1870s in New York City.  This is a moral conduct that Martin Scorsese offers an intimate illustration of in his The Age of Innocence (1993), where marriage because of love was thought of a vulgar and indecent act.Henry was growing up amidst the time of Victorian repression when it was fashionable to have a title and etiquette fit for a gentleman.  However, as a teen Henry was no gentleman according to the rules of Victorian etiquette at the time.  He kissed girls and befriended the family's French maid who also taught him how to drink wine and speak French.  A little more than a decade later he met the love of his life, but it also meant that he had to struggle with all the rules of the Victorian etiquette, as he married the girl who he fell in love with who also was engaged.  At the time, when the Heaven Can Wait was shot the strict codes of the Catholic Legion of Decency still ruled what was appropriate and inappropriate on the American film front.  The Victorian moral codes were similar in their intentions to the policies of the Catholic Legion of Decency and Lubitsch flirted with the line of what was inappropriate in a very intentional manner through his character Henry in the film that does not follow the strict codes of his time.  Indirectly and maybe unintentionally, Lubitsch was challenging the censorship policies of the country, as they were absurd and limited what many filmmakers and artists could express through the medium of cinema.Lubitsch, born in German, and was invited to make films in Hollywood in 1922.  More than a decade later the Nazi's wiped out his German citizenship, which forced him to stay in the United States.  However, he continued to express his concerns with society, which he did with witty subtlety in more than one way in Heaven Can Wait.  The film deals with interesting social moral codes inherited from sanctimonious sources that never have been questioned.  In the light of freedom, Lubitsch expresses his idea that these rules often restrict people from fully being able to express themselves.  Yet, it is within the fear of breaking these rules that he brings out the humor in a timely and brilliant manner.  Maybe, Lubitsch's foreign perspective enhanced his ability to visualize some of the awkwardness within the American society, as this cinematic experience challenges the audience to reflect on what is right and wrong, instead of blindly following what has been stated a rule.",5,Witty Subtlety Expresses True Intentions in Terrific Film...,1119052800,"06 18, 2005",2005,4048,"['actions', 'man', 'character', 'Christian', 'belief', 'character', 'will', 'come', 'judgment', 'day', 'last', 'breath', 'verdict', 'based', 'character', 'can', 'only', 'bring', 'person', 'one', 'two', 'directions', 'directions', 'are', 'according', 'common', 'Christian', 'belief', 'up', 'down', 'Up', 'refers', 'entering', 'heaven', 'down', 'person', 'scorching', 'situation', 'related', 'infinite', 'pain', 'Most', 'people', 'are', 'aware', 'actions', 'many', 'remain', 'blind', 'consequences', 'actions', 'Nonetheless', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'courage', 'stand', 'up', 'straight', 'take', 'what', 'deserve', 'Henry', 'Van', 'Cleve', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'such', 'man', 'who', 'rather', 'sure', 'destination', 'simply', 'stairs', 'down', 'walks', 'up', 'Devil', 'Laird', 'Cregar', 'Excellency', 'Ernst', 'Lubitsch', 'tale', 'Henry', 'who', 'Excellency', 'domain', 'Devil', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'brief', 'run-in', 'acquaintance', 'past', 'Excellency', 'curious', 'Henry', 'past', 'also', 'knowledge', 'Henry', 'identity', 'Thus', 'Henry', 'biography', 'shares', 'Excellency', 'light', 'women', 'life', 'story', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'who', 'began', 'quarrelling', 'when', 'how', 'much', 'affection', 'give', 'infant', 'Henry', 'tell', 'how', 'kept', 'running', 'women', 'childhood', 'adolescence', 'women', 'were', 'treated', 'affectionate', 'tender', 'care', 'kept', 'physical', 'distance', 'order', 'maintain', 'fashionable', 'moral', 'conduct', '1870s', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'moral', 'conduct', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'intimate', 'illustration', 'Age', 'Innocence', '1993', 'where', 'marriage', 'love', 'was', 'thought', 'vulgar', 'indecent', 'act.Henry', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'time', 'Victorian', 'repression', 'when', 'was', 'fashionable', 'have', 'title', 'etiquette', 'fit', 'gentleman', 'However', 'teen', 'Henry', 'was', 'gentleman', 'according', 'rules', 'Victorian', 'etiquette', 'time', 'kissed', 'girls', 'befriended', 'family', 'French', 'maid', 'who', 'also', 'taught', 'how', 'drink', 'wine', 'speak', 'French', 'little', 'more', 'decade', 'later', 'met', 'love', 'life', 'also', 'meant', 'had', 'struggle', 'rules', 'Victorian', 'etiquette', 'married', 'girl', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'who', 'also', 'was', 'engaged', 'time', 'when', 'Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait', 'was', 'shot', 'strict', 'codes', 'Catholic', 'Legion', 'Decency', 'still', 'ruled', 'what', 'was', 'appropriate', 'inappropriate', 'American', 'film', 'front', 'Victorian', 'moral', 'codes', 'were', 'similar', 'intentions', 'policies', 'Catholic', 'Legion', 'Decency', 'Lubitsch', 'flirted', 'line', 'what', 'was', 'inappropriate', 'very', 'intentional', 'manner', 'character', 'Henry', 'film', 'not', 'follow', 'strict', 'codes', 'time', 'Indirectly', 'maybe', 'unintentionally', 'Lubitsch', 'was', 'challenging', 'censorship', 'policies', 'country', 'were', 'absurd', 'limited', 'what', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'artists', 'could', 'express', 'medium', 'cinema.Lubitsch', 'born', 'German', 'was', 'invited', 'make', 'films', 'Hollywood', '1922', 'More', 'decade', 'later', 'Nazi', 'wiped', 'out', 'German', 'citizenship', 'forced', 'stay', 'United', 'States', 'However', 'continued', 'express', 'concerns', 'society', 'did', 'witty', 'subtlety', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait', 'film', 'deals', 'interesting', 'social', 'moral', 'codes', 'inherited', 'sanctimonious', 'sources', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'questioned', 'light', 'freedom', 'Lubitsch', 'idea', 'rules', 'often', 'restrict', 'people', 'fully', 'being', 'able', 'express', 'fear', 'breaking', 'rules', 'out', 'humor', 'timely', 'brilliant', 'manner', 'Maybe', 'Lubitsch', 'foreign', 'perspective', 'enhanced', 'ability', 'visualize', 'awkwardness', 'American', 'society', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'audience', 'reflect', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'instead', 'blindly', 'following', 'what', 'been', 'stated', 'rule']",N/A

He gets to tell his life story, which is recounted in the film, to see whether he really belongs in Satan's Realm after all.Although Ameche and Tierney have the starring roles here, Charles Coburn as the puckish and witty Grandpa steals many of the scenes. And Laird Cregar is superb as the Devil, a role he underplays with irony, wit, and charm, and he seems more like a bemused business executive rather than the Prince of Darkness himself. I would go so far as to say his supporting-role performance is actually the best part of the movie.A brief note on Cregar, which I turned from up the IMDB database. Can you believe he was only 26 or 27 when he played this role? He looks and acts like a suave, sophisticated, man in his 40's! Unfortunately Cregar died of complications from a crash diet. He had wanted to play leading-man roles, but when the 6' 3"" tall but husky Cregar decided to lose weight rapidly, he developed heart complications from the severe diet, and he died at only age 28--a great loss.Although Ameche is good in the role, I think it required a little more intensity and energy, and perhaps even roguishness, than Ameche displayed, but he still comes off as a basically good human being, despite his philandering ways with women--who we really don't get to see much of anyway in the film--so he doesn't seem like that successful a playboy, either. And the goodness part is important, since that's why the Devil thinks he may have come to Hell by mistake.Last but not least, the period sets are lavishly realized and certainly add to the overall ambience of the movie. And there are some funny scenes where the overly polite, New York upper- crust society of Ameche's family is contrasted with Tierney's crustier, but more down-to-earth and plain-speaking, parents from Kansas City.In the end, the Devil decides in Ameche's favor. When Ameche steps into the elevator connecting Heaven and Hell, he turns to Cregar and says expectantly, ""Down?"" And Laird Cregar has the last scene-stealing word, as he manages to seem both playful and ironic as he pronounces his fateful decision and says, No--up!""Overall, although not great, still a good movie.

256845,AK61LQI92GTCH,6301586050,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[3, 3]","Ernst Lubitsch's sweet biography of a love story holds up remarkably well.  The story begins in an antechamber of Hell, where aged Henry Van Cleve (Don Ameche) is pleading his case to His Excellency (Laird Cregar.)  Henry recounts his life story to His Excellency and, through a nearly movie-long flashback, seeks to explain why he doesn't deserve to spend eternity Up There.Henry's great sin, it seems, was in being a bit of a wandering rake during his long marriage to Martha (Gene Tierney.)  HEAVEN CAN WAIT was made in 1943, and whatever wandering Henry was guilty of is so muted, because of censorship probably, combined with Lubitsch's refined taste, that it's practically invisible. In any event, the impression is that it had something to do with Broadway showgirls and bauble gifts.  The movie doesn't loiter long enough with Henry-the-tomcat to make any of it explicit.  Simply enough to show that Henry and Martha's marriage was, as we'd put it today, `stressed,' and that Martha was possessed of a great capacity to forgive.  Doesn't sound like much of a comedy, does it?I guess that's where the `Lubitsch touch' everybody talks about comes into play.  Yeah, there's a deep and serious current flowing underneath, but actually HEAVEN CAN WAIT is often sparklingly humorous. Ameche has the right mixture of near-sophistication and graceful charm to keep him likeable and sympathetic.  If Henry is quaintly old fashioned, Martha is practically a saint.  Tierney has the tough task of playing a warm and wise woman who responds with common sense and compassion to events that could  have sent her character into a tongue blistering tirade.  The result is that we like both characters very much, and worry when their marriage encounters problems.  In fact, the only character I found myself disliking somewhat was Charles Coburn, who plays Henry's Gramps.  Coburn was a great character actor who normally raised the level of a movie by a couple of notches.  Here, his curmudgeony geriatric grates more than gratifies.  Worse, his character comes across false and contrived.  For instance, when he first meet Martha's parents, played by veteran character actors Eugene Pallette and Marjorie Main, his honeyed, veiled insults produce a groan rather than a smile.  They're supposed to sound witty, but they came across as mean.  It might have helped if they had said something - anything - insulting first.The Criterion print is in very good shape, with the Technicolor vibrantly restored.  The conversation between critics Molly Haskell and Andrew Sarris was a welcome, informed talk on the movie.  Screenwriter Samson Raphaelson, who wrote the scripts for a number of Lubitsch movies, is the subject of a couple of extras.  Bill Moyer's Portrait from 1982 is an interesting snapshot of the octogenarian Raphaelson, who was still writing and teaching at the time.  Also of interest was the Raphaelson appearance at the Museum of Modern Art in 1977 for a screening of HEAVEN CAN WAIT.  The audio of his conversation with film critic Richard Corliss and members of the audience are interesting.HEAVEN CAN WAIT isn't a perfect movie, but it'll make you laugh and draw you close to its main characters.
