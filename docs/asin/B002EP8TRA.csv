This isn't an artistic Ghibli film, that's for sure. The anime is a little flat, which doesn't stand out, but the storylines are so typical, though a little funny at times. This one, for some reason, was an early anime series I saw, that I wouldn't want to see again. It's ok, but way over the top. Though very successful with many spinoffs that followed the original. There are some types of anime or any storytelling form, that is a question of taste. Either you like it or you do not. This, IMO, is too juvenile for adults. It's not my type, I'll just leave it at that.",3,Ah My Goddess Vol 1-6 anime series,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,688,"['one', 'meant', 'kids', 'cute', 'first', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'someone', 'age', '15', 'would', 'think', ""n't"", 'artistic', 'Ghibli', 'film', 'sure', 'anime', 'little', 'flat', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'storylines', 'are', 'so', 'typical', 'little', 'funny', 'times', 'one', 'reason', 'was', 'early', 'anime', 'series', 'saw', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'again', 'ok', 'way', 'top', 'very', 'successful', 'many', 'spinoffs', 'followed', 'original', 'are', 'types', 'anime', 'storytelling', 'form', 'question', 'taste', 'like', 'do', 'not', 'IMO', 'too', 'juvenile', 'adults', 'not', 'type', ""'ll"", 'just', 'leave']",N/A
1265669,A3TZSS69WBE0KB,B002EP8TRA,Msanimefreak,"[11, 11]","Ah! My Goddess is one of those animes you will either love, or completely hate. I own the entire collection, both season 1 and 2. If you can't stand lovey dovey animes, or animes where its just about a developing relationship between the 2 main characters, then I would advise you to stay away. I am a hopeless romantic, so I pretty much fell in love with this series right away. The first season is better than the second for multiple reasons:First, the first season we are learning all about the characters. The plot is interesting because there isnt a repeative plot like the second season, where it is all about Keiichi telling Belldandy he loves her, which he does in the first season multiple times, but I guess when it gets to the second season, he forgets or something.Second, the animation is again, done very well. The colors are pretty and there isnt an episode I noticed where the charaters looked kinda rough.This complete collection include all of the First season, which is episodes 1-26, just in case anyone was wondering.The voice acting was done well, not the best. Some of the characters I couldnt stand to listen too, but I like Keiichi and Belldandy's voice actors.I would still advise you to watch the season on Youtube or Hulu before purchasing this product, just because it is such a repeative series, it may bother you and I dont want you to waste any money.So all in all, this anime receives 5 stars from me because I finally found a romantic anime that I enjoy. Also, the animation is done very well, and most of the voice acting is spot on. I would still advise you to watch it before you buy it, just to make sure it deserves a spot in your anime collection. Just as I said before, the second season is very repeative, so I would recommend season 1 over season 2, but if you like having the entire anime collection, then go for it!",5,Better than the Second Season,1316995200,"09 26, 2011",2011,1860,"['Ah', 'Goddess', 'one', 'animes', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'completely', 'hate', 'own', 'entire', 'collection', 'season', '1', '2', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'lovey', 'dovey', 'animes', 'animes', 'where', 'just', 'developing', 'relationship', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'then', 'would', 'advise', 'stay', 'away', 'am', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'pretty', 'much', 'fell', 'love', 'series', 'right', 'away', 'first', 'season', 'better', 'second', 'multiple', 'reasons', 'First', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'learning', 'characters', 'plot', 'interesting', 'repeative', 'plot', 'second', 'season', 'where', 'Keiichi', 'telling', 'Belldandy', 'first', 'season', 'multiple', 'times', 'guess', 'when', 'second', 'season', 'something.Second', 'animation', 'again', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'colors', 'are', 'pretty', 'there', 'isnt', 'episode', 'noticed', 'where', 'charaters', 'looked', 'kinda', 'rough.This', 'complete', 'collection', 'include', 'First', 'season', 'episodes', '1-26', 'just', 'case', 'anyone', 'was', 'wondering.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'not', 'best', 'characters', 'couldnt', 'stand', 'listen', 'too', 'like', 'Keiichi', 'Belldandy', 'voice', 'actors.I', 'would', 'still', 'advise', 'watch', 'season', 'Youtube', 'Hulu', 'purchasing', 'product', 'just', 'such', 'repeative', 'series', 'may', 'bother', 'dont', 'want', 'waste', 'money.So', 'anime', '5', 'stars', 'finally', 'found', 'romantic', 'anime', 'enjoy', 'Also', 'animation', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'most', 'voice', 'acting', 'spot', 'would', 'still', 'advise', 'watch', 'buy', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'spot', 'anime', 'collection', 'Just', 'said', 'second', 'season', 'very', 'repeative', 'would', 'recommend', 'season', '1', 'season', '2', 'like', 'having', 'entire', 'anime', 'collection', 'then', 'go']",N/A
1265670,A7FZ9X0B6QBS3,B002EP8TRA,Ronald E. Olivier,"[0, 0]","This is a series that I really thought I'd like.  The first few episodes were pretty strong, especially when centered on the main characters of Keiichi and the goddess Beldandy.  Keiichi's sister Megumi pops into the series, and one can easily start thinking of plot complications that arise.  But the whole series goes over the top when Beldandy's goddess sisters Urd and Skuld show up, as well as the demon Mara.Some of the other (earthly) characters would be a bit more fun to watch if they weren't so two-dimensional.  These include Keiichi's friends from the Auto Club as well as the hottest girl and coolest guy in college.  Every time they show up onscreen, you know what they're up to (with the possible exception of the Auto Club guys dressed as cheerleaders).Most of the `action' is ho-hum, and most of the jokes and sight gags are pretty lame (though there were two or three that were hilarious).  The middle episodes just kind of plod along.  But as the series begins to wind down, it actually gets better, even though the details are confusing, and there's never a doubt about the how it will all turn out.  I thought episode 24 provided a satisfactory ending, so I never watched the last 2 episodes.All in all, I can't say that I recommend this series very highly.  I'm giving it a three star rating based on a strong beginning and ending, and a few worthwhile jokes in between.",3,"Good beginning and ending, but to much fluff in between",1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,1392,"['series', 'really', 'thought', ""'d"", 'like', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'were', 'pretty', 'strong', 'especially', 'when', 'centered', 'main', 'characters', 'Keiichi', 'goddess', 'Beldandy', 'Keiichi', 'sister', 'Megumi', 'series', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'start', 'thinking', 'plot', 'complications', 'arise', 'whole', 'series', 'top', 'when', 'Beldandy', 'goddess', 'sisters', 'Urd', 'Skuld', 'show', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'demon', 'Mara.Some', 'other', 'earthly', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'two-dimensional', 'include', 'Keiichi', 'friends', 'Auto', 'Club', 'as', 'well', 'hottest', 'girl', 'coolest', 'guy', 'college', 'time', 'show', 'up', 'onscreen', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'up', 'possible', 'exception', 'Auto', 'Club', 'guys', 'dressed', 'cheerleaders', '.Most', 'action', 'ho-hum', 'most', 'jokes', 'sight', 'gags', 'are', 'pretty', 'lame', 'were', 'two', 'three', 'were', 'hilarious', 'middle', 'just', 'kind', 'plod', 'series', 'wind', 'down', 'actually', 'better', 'even', 'details', 'are', 'confusing', 'never', 'doubt', 'how', 'will', 'all', 'turn', 'out', 'thought', 'episode', '24', 'provided', 'satisfactory', 'ending', 'never', 'watched', 'last', '2', 'episodes.All', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'recommend', 'series', 'very', 'highly', ""'m"", 'giving', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'based', 'strong', 'beginning', 'ending', 'few', 'worthwhile', 'jokes']",N/A

Well, not really, when it comes to sentiment and tugging at the heart-strings, the Japanese don't hold back!This show was created at a time when the economy was going bad in Japan and the divorce rate was starting to clime. Relationships between men and women were breaking down. I suppose that either consciously or subconsciously, the makers of this Anim&eacute; created in Belldandy a symbol of love, hope, honour and faithfulness. She's a goddess, of course!Okay, at the start we meet Keiichi, a university student for whom just about nothing goes right. The seniors give him a hard time, he's a little on the short side and he is spectacularly unsuccessful with girls. In short, he's a bit of a nerd - but an endearing nerd, nonetheless. Then one night, when it is all getting on top of him, he dials for some take-away food, only to mistakenly rings the ""Goddess Line"", who deliver Belldandy to his room. Belldandy explains to Keiichi that Heaven has seen that the balance in his line has been a little out of kilter and he could do with a wish being granted - only one wish, Belldandy stresses. Keiichi dithers, he suspects the whole thing is a set-up by the seniors to humiliate him, but finally he decides - ""I'd like a girl like you to be by my side forever.""Wish granted! And Belldandy herself steps in to fulfil his wish.Of course, the seniors quickly find out that Keiichi has a woman in the dormitory - a men's only dormitory - and Belldandy and Keiichi are kicked out. Then the fun begins.The story has many amusing moments, particularly when Belldandy's sisters, Urd and Skuld come down to earth to complicate Keiichi's life further. The story also shows the slowly, but surely, developing love between Belldandy and Keiichi, a love that is so touching because it is born out of the utter devotion of Belldandy, in time, Keiichi.For me the most memorable and moving moment is when Belldandy tells Keiichi that even though she is free to return to heaven, she will stay anyway ""because I love you"".Romance, endearing and well drawn characters, good heart, kindness, humanity, grace and some good laughs too - that's ""Ah! My Goddess"".

That said I rather like it and will be getting the second seasonWhen I got it the forth disk of the six disk set was split in two. I contacted the seller through Amazon and it was promptly replaced.The original packaging was a padded envelope that was bubble wrapped and inside another envelope. The problem lies with the manufacturer. Stacking disks on top of one another is always a bad idea. Unfortunately it's also cheaper.The set arrived promptly as did the replacement disk.
