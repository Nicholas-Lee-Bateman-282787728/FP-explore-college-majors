1390247,A2V0P9FMG2996Y,B0049TC8EO,Cassandra (The Huge Anime Fan),"[0, 0]","Full, review courtesy through Book & Movie Dimension a BlogSpeed Grapher is another anime series that has a grittier and dark tone. It's not in anyway awful but definitely delves into the doors of the human soul that are by far the worst. In it all, there is sometimes things to still look forward to.The main characters Saiga and Kagura are just awesome. Saiga is a grown man that is instantly drawn to Kagura a young teen girl. Saiga realizes their obvious age differences, so always responds if someone mentions there relationship by saying ""it not like that"" or by totally ignoring the question. Seeming extremely hilarious. Kagura is the heir to a rich empire thanks to her mother. It is slowly shown Kagura is no regular adolescent girl but possesses powers of turning regular humans into Euphorias (people with supernatural powers connected to their innermost desires) through an exchange of her bodily fluids with anyone. She's a type of catalyst for a chemical reaction. Saiga notices that Kagura in a semi-hypnoticed state is led to kiss privileged members of this secret society so as to turn them into Euphorics. Saiga being a photographer has become enamored by his latest subject Kagura. He helps her escape from the constraining secret twisted society but not without consequences. The man behind the organization named Suitengu that tries to get Kagura to gift people with powers wants her back and pulls all the stops to get her back. Kagura's mother is a huge crime queen that despises her daughter because of her great looks believing hers are fading. This is an interesting aspect of the anime later explained. Kagura on the other hand finds her cruelty mean and can't understand it because of being naive. She is on many occasions abused by her mother. In a teacher, she finds help but you wouldn't believe what her mother does to convince her teacher that at home no abuse is going on. The moment while totally disturbing is also hilarious.Moving at a real swift pace throughout the anime there are types of equally cool and disgusting characters introduced. You'll become obsessed with the characters. As Saiga tries to keep Kagura from the evil organization led by Suitengu who has his own devious agenda he wants to further along. Leading watchers on a hugely entertaining  road of action and danger. Ending with a surprisingly, yet satisfying conclusion.For anime fans interested in the artwork aspect of it then it has an unusual style of a animation. It's most assuredly anime but looks like comics-American-style. It's nice to look at and again found very lovely. The use of characters shows very original ones too. There are various weird characters mentioned that are rather disgusting yet impressive to see. The artwork scope of it is definitely something to look at!Speed Grapher is a highly recommended anime series. Just from its artwork its a worthwhile watch along with becoming immersed in some vastly fascinating characters. While this anime is wholly intense in the world it creates, its on the whole addicting.Genre: Drama, Psychological, Science Fiction, Crime, Mystery, Young Adult, Human Nature",5,Just from its artwork its a worthwhile watch,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,3138,"['Full', 'review', 'courtesy', 'Book', 'Movie', 'Dimension', 'BlogSpeed', 'Grapher', 'anime', 'series', 'grittier', 'dark', 'tone', 'not', 'anyway', 'awful', 'definitely', 'delves', 'doors', 'human', 'soul', 'are', 'far', 'worst', 'sometimes', 'things', 'still', 'look', 'forward', 'to.The', 'main', 'characters', 'Saiga', 'Kagura', 'are', 'just', 'awesome', 'Saiga', 'grown', 'man', 'instantly', 'drawn', 'Kagura', 'young', 'teen', 'girl', 'Saiga', 'obvious', 'age', 'differences', 'so', 'always', 'someone', 'mentions', 'there', 'relationship', 'saying', 'not', 'totally', 'ignoring', 'question', 'Seeming', 'extremely', 'hilarious', 'Kagura', 'heir', 'rich', 'empire', 'thanks', 'mother', 'slowly', 'shown', 'Kagura', 'regular', 'adolescent', 'girl', 'powers', 'turning', 'regular', 'humans', 'Euphorias', 'people', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'connected', 'innermost', 'desires', 'exchange', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'anyone', 'type', 'catalyst', 'chemical', 'reaction', 'Saiga', 'Kagura', 'semi-hypnoticed', 'state', 'led', 'kiss', 'privileged', 'members', 'secret', 'society', 'so', 'turn', 'Euphorics', 'Saiga', 'being', 'photographer', 'become', 'enamored', 'latest', 'subject', 'Kagura', 'escape', 'constraining', 'secret', 'twisted', 'society', 'not', 'consequences', 'man', 'organization', 'named', 'Suitengu', 'get', 'Kagura', 'gift', 'people', 'powers', 'back', 'stops', 'get', 'back', 'Kagura', 'mother', 'huge', 'crime', 'queen', 'daughter', 'great', 'looks', 'believing', 'hers', 'are', 'fading', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'anime', 'later', 'explained', 'Kagura', 'other', 'hand', 'cruelty', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'being', 'naive', 'many', 'occasions', 'abused', 'mother', 'teacher', 'help', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'mother', 'convince', 'teacher', 'home', 'abuse', 'going', 'moment', 'totally', 'disturbing', 'also', 'hilarious.Moving', 'real', 'swift', 'pace', 'anime', 'are', 'types', 'equally', 'cool', 'disgusting', 'characters', 'introduced', ""'ll"", 'become', 'obsessed', 'characters', 'Saiga', 'keep', 'Kagura', 'evil', 'organization', 'led', 'Suitengu', 'who', 'own', 'devious', 'agenda', 'further', 'along', 'Leading', 'watchers', 'hugely', 'entertaining', 'road', 'action', 'danger', 'Ending', 'surprisingly', 'yet', 'satisfying', 'conclusion.For', 'anime', 'fans', 'interested', 'artwork', 'aspect', 'then', 'unusual', 'style', 'animation', 'most', 'assuredly', 'anime', 'comics-American-style', 'nice', 'look', 'again', 'found', 'very', 'lovely', 'use', 'characters', 'shows', 'very', 'original', 'ones', 'too', 'are', 'various', 'weird', 'characters', 'mentioned', 'are', 'rather', 'disgusting', 'yet', 'impressive', 'see', 'artwork', 'scope', 'definitely', 'something', 'look', 'Speed', 'Grapher', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anime', 'series', 'Just', 'artwork', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'becoming', 'immersed', 'vastly', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'anime', 'wholly', 'intense', 'world', 'whole', 'addicting.Genre', 'Drama', 'Psychological', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'Young', 'Adult', 'Human', 'Nature']",Speed Grapher: Complete Series S.A.V.E.

1390249,A3OAQIK7XEFBNP,B0049TC8EO,Deputy-_-S_E_X_Y,"[2, 3]","My gf loves anime way more than me and wanted to watch this with me one day. I knew nothing about it, but to make her happy, I watched it with her. I am very picky about the anime I watch and like, I only like a handful of anime. I was hooked within the first 2 episodes! This is such a great show, I had to get it! More for the adult and mature crowd. Speed Grapher is intended to only be 1 season long, which can be good sometimes, even though you want more, it's good to know when to end it.Speed Grapher is about a former war photographer named Saiga who stumbles on a hidden, underground club during an investigation that is exclusively only for the most rich and powerful. This club, which is run by Suitengu, the main anti hero in this anime, pratices bizarre rituals that worship a 15 year old Goddess named Kagura. Kagura does not realise what goes on in this fetish club as it is a blur of a dream to her. During these rituals, in a hypnotize state, the Goddess kisses the chosen subject thus releasing their inner most desire. Saiga just so happens, crashes this ritual at the right time and during a scuffle, he finds himself in front of the Goddess and she gives him a kiss granting his inner most desire. Turns out his desire is to destroy anything he photographs. Saiga attempts to free Kagura as she awakens during the ritual confused and frightened. The two escape and it turns into a cat and mouse game between Saiga and Kagura and Suitengu and his club. The rituals have been going on for a while, thus many members have had their most secret desires come true, making quite a few interesting villians! Some such as a man who can stretch beyond human anatomy, a man whos tattoos come to life, a woman whos love for diamonds turns her into a moving mannequinn that is pure diamond and has claws that are just as sharp, and so on.
