I was fascinated by the available facts of the case, and by Bernardo and Homolka themselves. In the film version, KARLA, Laura Prepon portrays Karla Homolka as a dominated victim, controlled by Paul Bernardo (Misha Collins) through abuse and terror. I would usually roll my eyes at this seemingly one-sided story, w/ Bernardo being the only sadistic, homicidal monster. However, the empty, soulless nature of Prepon's performance is quite chilling in itself, showing how far a human being can go before doing what is right. Even if this Homolka-view of the story is true, it presents us w/ a feeble-minded creature, unable to save the lives of others due to her own weakness, impotence, and total insecurity.

1047958,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B000MNOXX0,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","I believe that the first time that I learned about Paul Bernardo was while watching the show ""Wicked Attraction.""  The story almost didn't seem real, it was so outlandish, and so twisted.  After watching that episode and watching some YouTube videos, I actually was quite convinced of the following:  Mr. Bernardo is worse than Ted Bundy.  Why?  Well, it seems to me that Mr. Bundy didn't ""toy"" with his victims too much; he was ""nice"" enough to kill them quickly -- at least most of the time -- while Mr. Bernardo treated his victims like mice, and he wasn't really much of a playful cat while doing it.But after doing a little research -- currently, I am reading the book ""Invisible Darkness"" by Stephen Williams (I am only about 1/4 through, but it seems to be a terrific read so far; Mr. Williams is a very good writer, no doubt about that) -- it appears that a lot of people think that Karla Homolka is worse than Mr. Bernardo!  Perhaps it's because most serial killers are men; perhaps it's because Ms. Homolka should have helped protect the females that Mr. Bernardo tormented; perhaps it was for other reasons that people have this belief.  I'm not completely sure.But here is the rub.  When you get into these types of arguments, you're really devolving into a moral equivalence fallacy.  Does it really matter who's worse, really?  And is it even possible to know?  Couldn't it be the case that they're all morally depraved, and therefore it just doesn't really matter?But I have seen a few reviews around on ""Karla,"" and a lot of people don't like this film because, in their opinion, it puts Ms. Homolka into too good of a light.  A lot of them wanted this film to slam her instead of trying to explain why she did what she did.  But that is not the purpose of film, really.  Film is to entertain, even while it is hard to say that this film is completely entertaining due to the subject matter.  And even though Misha Collins is pretty good as Mr. Bernardo, I believe Ms. Prepon is the true star here, and really is allowed to show her acting chops with this performance.Don't allow yourself to get sucked down the moral equivalency drain, if you decide to watch the film.  Instead, watch it for Ms. Prepon's performance.  While it may be arguable how bad Ms. Homolka really was or still even is (while she supposedly is living in paradise now somewhere in the Caribbean), I think it is not very arguable that Ms. Prepon gives a very powerful performance in this role.",4,Worse than Bundy?,1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,2481,"['believe', 'first', 'time', 'learned', 'Paul', 'Bernardo', 'was', 'watching', 'show', 'Wicked', 'Attraction', 'story', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'real', 'was', 'so', 'outlandish', 'so', 'twisted', 'watching', 'episode', 'watching', 'YouTube', 'videos', 'actually', 'was', 'quite', 'convinced', 'following', 'Mr.', 'Bernardo', 'worse', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'Why', 'Well', 'Mr.', 'Bundy', 'did', ""n't"", 'toy', 'victims', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'nice', 'enough', 'kill', 'quickly', 'least', 'most', 'time', 'Mr.', 'Bernardo', 'treated', 'victims', 'mice', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'playful', 'cat', 'doing', 'it.But', 'doing', 'little', 'research', 'currently', 'am', 'reading', 'book', 'Invisible', 'Darkness', 'Stephen', 'Williams', 'am', 'only', 'about', '1/4', 'be', 'terrific', 'read', 'so', 'far', 'Mr.', 'Williams', 'very', 'good', 'writer', 'doubt', 'lot', 'people', 'think', 'Karla', 'Homolka', 'worse', 'Mr.', 'Bernardo', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'serial', 'killers', 'are', 'men', 'perhaps', 'Ms.', 'Homolka', 'should', 'have', 'helped', 'protect', 'females', 'Mr.', 'Bernardo', 'tormented', 'perhaps', 'was', 'other', 'reasons', 'people', 'have', 'belief', ""'m"", 'not', 'completely', 'sure.But', 'here', 'rub', 'When', 'get', 'types', 'arguments', ""'re"", 'really', 'devolving', 'moral', 'equivalence', 'fallacy', 'really', 'matter', 'who', 'worse', 'really', 'even', 'possible', 'know', 'Could', ""n't"", 'be', 'case', ""'re"", 'morally', 'depraved', 'therefore', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'reviews', 'Karla', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'opinion', 'Ms.', 'Homolka', 'too', 'good', 'light', 'lot', 'wanted', 'film', 'slam', 'instead', 'trying', 'explain', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'purpose', 'film', 'really', 'Film', 'entertain', 'even', 'hard', 'say', 'film', 'completely', 'entertaining', 'due', 'subject', 'matter', 'even', 'Misha', 'Collins', 'pretty', 'good', 'Mr.', 'Bernardo', 'believe', 'Ms.', 'Prepon', 'true', 'star', 'here', 'really', 'allowed', 'show', 'acting', 'chops', 'performance.Do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'get', 'sucked', 'down', 'moral', 'equivalency', 'drain', 'decide', 'watch', 'film', 'Instead', 'watch', 'Ms.', 'Prepon', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'arguable', 'how', 'bad', 'Ms.', 'Homolka', 'really', 'was', 'still', 'even', 'supposedly', 'living', 'paradise', 'now', 'somewhere', 'Caribbean', 'think', 'not', 'very', 'arguable', 'Ms.', 'Prepon', 'very', 'powerful', 'performance', 'role']",Karla

His portrayal of the cold hearted killer was chilling and top notch acting.  He was Paul.  This is one of those rare instances that when you think of the real killer that this movie is based on, you can only picture Misha Collins in your mind.  That is how good he is in this film.Laura Prepon is a revelation also.  It is truly brilliant acting when you can say so much and not speak at all.  She has the ability to speak with her eyes, and that is truly a talent.  I know nothing of the real Karla, but Laura makes her seem both sympathetic  and pathetic.  We see her only as a woman in love and willing to do anything to keep the man she loves.  She is most probably sick, yes, an accomplice to murder, yes.  But your heart hurts for her because of Prepon`s performance.  At least mine did.There is no gore in this film but it didn't need any.  The psychological horror was enough.  Conscience and morality.  Where would we be without them?  More than likely we would be living the lives of Karla and Paul.  The film's message is clear: be careful what you do for love.  Because in the end, love may have nothing to do with  it.  I highly recommend this film for the heart felt performances.  I applaud the film makers for making this film despite many protests against it.  And I can only hope that Karla finds the peace that she stole from all those families of the victims.

(The jury concluded she was 'artificial, manupulative and with a strong moral vaccum bordering on psychosis' but there is no depiction of these traits anywhere in the movie's portrayal of her, just a scared, victimised woman).

1047977,A387BD735MI50R,B000MNOXX0,R. Schultz,"[1, 2]","This movie is probably a fairly accurate portrayal of the actual rape-murders that Karla Homolka famously helped her boyfriend commit. Karla became complicit in procuring young girls for her boyfriend to kidnap and attack during his long reign of terror in the Scarborough/St. Catherines areas of Ontario, Canada. She was ultimately convicted of having participated in only one of the murders.Karla denied any direct knowledge of the murder as it was in progress. So this movie obviously had to make a decision about how to present her. The producers/director probably struck close to the truth when they chose to in fact show Karla as being knowledgeable about and actively abetting the crimes.However, there is a sort of inherent contradiction in that interpretation. The psychologists who evaluated Karla (one of whom is intelligently portrayed here by actor Patrick Bauchau) pronounced her a sociopath - an amoral person lacking any capacity for empathy. In this movie version of her though, we see a woman in thrall to her boyfriend. Karla is shown being motivated by a desperate need to accommodate his sick needs in order to hold onto him.So we don't know - was Karla suffering from an inability to love, or was she suffering from a tendency to love too compulsively? Was she suffering from a form of Stockholm Syndrome? As her boyfriend brutalizes Karla in turn, did this abuse form an adhesive seam between the two, bonding Karla all the more tightly to her captor?""Karla"" will leave you arguing these possibilities. Laura Prepon does a good job walking the line between the extremes. While, as Karla, she convincingly maintains she did it for love, her face remains blue ice impassive throughout her own and the other women's torment.After watching this movie, you might be inclined to pursue the theme of a person's willingness to ""go along"" with madness a little further. If so, you can check out ""Bug"" starring Ashley Judd.

1047979,A26WVK274IA7DN,B000MNOXX0,Sarah Bellum,"[24, 26]","""Karla"" is a small, fairly low-budget film that rather quietly recounts the story of Karla Homolka, wife of serial rapist and murderer Paul Bernardo. Being somewhat familiar with their story, I anticipated it would translate well to film. For the most part, the film succeeds in providing a realistic portrayal of a battered wife, whose husband managed to maintain a semblance of normalcy and elude capture for a few years. The tone of the film is fairly understated, which seems to contrast somewhat with the story. These were some horrific, disturbing events that might be shocking, though they were also true. Director Joel Bender deserves credit for not making them overly dramatic by adding stylized violence or ominous music, as so often happens in films that deal with this type of material. The actors also deserve credit for not overacting and hamming up their performances, which often occurs in horror and suspense films. Perhaps out of respect for the families of the victims, this film is not exploitive or sensationalized. If one watches this film expecting a prurient, American-style horror film, replete with blood, gore and gratuitous nudity, one will find the experience disappointing. I was, nonetheless, a little disappointed with the film, though not for the above reasons. It is pretty clear that Karla Homolka was abused by Paul Bernardo and that he perpetrated some atrocious, unconscionable acts. I cannot comprehend why abused women stay with their men, though I know it does happen. Karla Homolka was (and perhaps still is) a deceitful, manipulative individual, who knew her husband was raping and murdering young women; yet, she did nothing about it until her own life came into jeopardy. Even though she decided to stay, that doesn't provide rationale for condoning his raping and murdering these women. The end of the film contains an epilogue, which refutes much of what was portrayed in the film. It states in part that she has expressed no sympathy for the murdered girls, yet she is portrayed in the film as being at least moderately sympathetic toward them. She also did not appear to be too emotionally hurt by her abuse, as though the filmmakers could not decide what to make of her and consequently decided to write the character without much of a personality. It seems her character is based solely on a credulous, verbatim reading of interviews with her so that she comes across as stoic, detached and passive. Perhaps in reality she is emotionless and inured to her environment, though here she is presented so innocuously that it makes me wonder how ""Evil has a beautiful face"" was chosen as the tagline. Her character provides the impetus for the story since it is told from her perspective, which makes her lack of definition rather unfortunate for this film. Character issues aside, the film has too many slow-motion scenes, which gives it a little made-for-TV feel. Although no subtitles are included, the DVD does have several deleted scenes that are presented by the director. After hearing his extremely dry, insipid introductions, I understood how Karla's character came to be so underdeveloped. Contrast this film with ""Monster"" for a good example of how a person's motivations and experiences can be parlayed into an interesting, yet insidious character. For a different perspective of these characters, read the books ""Invisible Darkness"" or ""Deadly Innocence.""",3,Not as good as I had hoped it would be,1177545600,"04 26, 2007",2007,3414,"['Karla', 'small', 'fairly', 'low-budget', 'film', 'rather', 'quietly', 'story', 'Karla', 'Homolka', 'wife', 'serial', 'rapist', 'murderer', 'Paul', 'Bernardo', 'Being', 'somewhat', 'familiar', 'story', 'anticipated', 'would', 'translate', 'well', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'providing', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'battered', 'wife', 'husband', 'managed', 'maintain', 'semblance', 'normalcy', 'elude', 'capture', 'few', 'years', 'tone', 'film', 'fairly', 'understated', 'contrast', 'somewhat', 'story', 'were', 'horrific', 'disturbing', 'events', 'might', 'be', 'shocking', 'were', 'also', 'true', 'Director', 'Joel', 'Bender', 'credit', 'not', 'making', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'adding', 'stylized', 'violence', 'ominous', 'music', 'so', 'often', 'films', 'deal', 'type', 'material', 'actors', 'also', 'deserve', 'credit', 'not', 'overacting', 'hamming', 'up', 'performances', 'often', 'horror', 'suspense', 'films', 'Perhaps', 'respect', 'families', 'victims', 'film', 'not', 'exploitive', 'sensationalized', 'one', 'film', 'expecting', 'prurient', 'American-style', 'horror', 'film', 'replete', 'blood', 'gore', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'one', 'will', 'find', 'experience', 'disappointing', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'little', 'disappointed', 'film', 'not', 'above', 'reasons', 'pretty', 'clear', 'Karla', 'Homolka', 'was', 'abused', 'Paul', 'Bernardo', 'perpetrated', 'atrocious', 'unconscionable', 'acts', 'can', 'not', 'comprehend', 'why', 'abused', 'women', 'stay', 'men', 'know', 'happen', 'Karla', 'Homolka', 'was', 'perhaps', 'still', 'deceitful', 'manipulative', 'individual', 'who', 'knew', 'husband', 'was', 'raping', 'murdering', 'young', 'women', 'yet', 'did', 'nothing', 'own', 'life', 'came', 'jeopardy', 'Even', 'decided', 'stay', ""n't"", 'provide', 'rationale', 'condoning', 'raping', 'murdering', 'women', 'end', 'film', 'epilogue', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'portrayed', 'film', 'part', 'expressed', 'sympathy', 'murdered', 'girls', 'yet', 'portrayed', 'film', 'being', 'least', 'moderately', 'sympathetic', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'too', 'emotionally', 'hurt', 'abuse', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'not', 'decide', 'what', 'make', 'consequently', 'decided', 'write', 'character', 'much', 'personality', 'character', 'based', 'solely', 'credulous', 'verbatim', 'reading', 'interviews', 'so', 'stoic', 'detached', 'passive', 'Perhaps', 'reality', 'emotionless', 'inured', 'environment', 'here', 'presented', 'so', 'innocuously', 'wonder', 'how', 'Evil', 'beautiful', 'face', 'was', 'chosen', 'tagline', 'character', 'impetus', 'story', 'told', 'perspective', 'lack', 'definition', 'rather', 'unfortunate', 'film', 'Character', 'issues', 'aside', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'slow-motion', 'scenes', 'little', 'made-for-TV', 'feel', 'subtitles', 'are', 'included', 'DVD', 'have', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'presented', 'director', 'hearing', 'extremely', 'dry', 'insipid', 'introductions', 'understood', 'how', 'Karla', 'character', 'came', 'be', 'so', 'underdeveloped', 'Contrast', 'film', 'Monster', 'good', 'example', 'how', 'person', 'motivations', 'experiences', 'can', 'be', 'parlayed', 'interesting', 'yet', 'insidious', 'character', 'different', 'perspective', 'characters', 'read', 'books', 'Invisible', 'Darkness', 'Deadly', 'Innocence']",Karla
