His latest marriage is crumbling, heading toward divorce. Steve just can't let that happen. His wife, Joyce (Faith Ford) winds up dead in a terrible &#34;medical incident&#34;. Steve has her body cremated quicker than you can say, &#34;poison-induced organ failure&#34;! Steve's last ex-wife, Edie is suspicious, but no one else seems to share her concerns. Meanwhile, old Steve has moved on, and started up a new romance w/ the daughter of a race competitor. Seemingly within seconds, the two are married, but dad doesn't appear to be overly thrilled. It takes no time at all for Steve to prove his a$$-holiness to his latest bride. She begins blubbering, upsetting Steve, and, well... let's just say that she gets real sick, real fast! Yep, it's time for another funeral. Edie finally finds a sympathetic cop from Fresno. Working together, the two set out to nail Steve for his lethal activities. Based on a true story, MURDER SO SWEET is a well-made TV thriller. Hamlin is perfectly detestable in his sociopathic role. Also stars Ed Lauter (MAGIC, CUJO) as racer, Glen Emery; and Eileen Brennan is excellent as Steve's doomed mum, who has a few dark secrets of her own.

I didn't expect anything stellar, but I doubt the creators of this Lifetime channel type show were out to set the world on fire here.  It's a typical &#34;rainy Sunday afternoon&#34; time-passer show.  With that said, it is entertaining in a blase sort of way. Hamlin is excellent as usual and does a great job portraying a psychopath, which is always fun to see (juxtaposed against his L.A. Law character, especially.)  If you have not got a whole heck of a lot to do and want to be mildly but pleasantly entertained, this is pretty good.
