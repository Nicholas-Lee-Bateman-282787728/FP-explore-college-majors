This set was nice because each season fits in a dvd case so its not like its a bulky dvd case like some other series pack their series. I got this when it was on a lightning deal so I got a decent price for it. I've been wanting it for so long. very happy.,5,An Awesome series if only all seasons were available,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,401,"['disappointing', 'only', 'seasons', '1-6', 'are', 'available', 'was', 'only', 'able', 'find', 'dvd', 'wish', 'was', 'available', 'blu-ray', 'love', 'series', 'set', 'was', 'nice', 'season', 'dvd', 'case', 'so', 'not', 'bulky', 'dvd', 'case', 'other', 'series', 'pack', 'series', 'got', 'when', 'was', 'lightning', 'deal', 'got', 'decent', 'price', ""'ve"", 'been', 'wanting', 'so', 'long', 'very', 'happy']",King of the Hill - Seasons 1 - 6
