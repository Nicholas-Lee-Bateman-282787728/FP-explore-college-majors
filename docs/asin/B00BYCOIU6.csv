1641072,A2JCDEK5UVKU1Q,B00BYCOIU6,"D. Demro ""Vietnam War and WWII historian""","[3, 3]","Father Jerzy Popieluszko was a Roman Catholic priest from Communist Poland who courageously spoke out against the persecution of the Polish people and was outspoken in his support of the Solidarity movement that was sweeping the unions in the 1980s. When the Communists saw their lies were not resonating with the Polish people, it was a Catholic priest they feared most. A Catholic priest who spoke the truth and helped his people to see the lies and distortion that so often are associated with the evil of Communism. In the end, the Communists chose to do what they do best - use force, intimidation and finally murder to silence the voice of the people. On October 19, 1984 Father Popieluszko was kidnapped by three agents of the Polish Communist Internal Intelligence Agency. He was severely beaten, then bound with rope and thrown into a reservoir where his body was recovered 11 days later.  Father Popieluszko has since been recognized as a martyr by the Catholic Church and on June 6, 2010 he was beatified.I remember quite clearly reading about the brutal murder of this priest in Reader's Digest at the time it took place. I was horrified by the sheer brutality of the beating of this Catholic Priest before they finally hung a rope around his neck that had a weight tied to the other end, and while still alive, they threw him into a waterway where he died. What is most ironic is how just a few short years later, in this same paper mill just feet from where I was seated at the time I read this story, a friend and fellow co-worker was brutally beaten, had a rope tied around his neck that was attached to a weight, and was thrown in a pulp vat to die because he too chose to take a stand against evil.  In this case it was the evil that existed in six union thugs who were eventually sentenced to life in prison for the murder. Evil is evil and wherever there is good there will always be evil. It seems throughout history wherever you have Communism you will find the persecution and murder of Catholic priests and nuns because they are deemed a threat to those who want to disallow free thinking and who only seek to control people with an iron fist.When I came across the movie on Amazon I decided to order it and learn more about the story behind the man (I also strongly recommend the following movies which also deal with the horrific realities of communism):- ""Katyn"" (True story of the cold-blooded execution of almost 22,000 Polish Nationals by the Russians in 1940).- ""Guilty of Treason"" (True story of Hungarian Cardinal J&oacute;zsef Mindszenty, played by Charles Bickford, who was tortured and given a life sentence in 1949 for his uncompromising opposition to fascism and communism in Hungary).- ""Eleni"" (The true story of an award-winning investigative journalist from the NY Times, played by John Malkovich, who returns to his native Greece with the intention to track down and kill the former communist soldier who was responsible for the 1949 torture and murder of his mother (for smuggling her children out of Greece to the United States).- ""To Kill A Priest"" (The English-produced version of ""Popieluszko: Freedom is Within Us"" starring Ed Harris and Christopher Lambert of ""The Highlander""). Personally, after seeing both versions I felt watching the movie in its native tongue gives a much more realistic feel to this tragedy).- ""Escape From Camp 14"" (True story of a man named Shin Dong-hyuk who, in 1996, escaped from the N.Korean slave labor camp from which he was born into, and sadly from where his actions convicted his mother and brother to death).These are the kind of movies that should be shown in every American classroom so this generation of young adults can better understand the true meaning of Communism. Very little is reported about the atrocities taking place, to this very day, in countries like the Soviet Union, China, Cuba and North Korea. Communism silences all freedom of expression, freedom of worship, freedom of speech, freedom of travel, etc., etc. I have heard countless stories from those who've escaped Communist countries and the stories are always the same: stories of unspeakable horror, suffering, imprisonment, death and brutality. They are Godless societies which lack human compassion, love, trust, assistance on all levels, food, etc. All the freedoms and luxuries we so readily take for granted here in America, cannot even be imagined by the citizens of these countries. And yet sadly, every year Americans surrender more and more of their freedom to an ever-growing government that is over-reaching the restrictions placed on it by our Constitution. The more control that is surrendered to the government the more restrictions we will find ourselves living under.In addition to Americans losing more of their freedoms to their government, there are factions of people who have made it their mission to deny the majority of Americans their right to celebrate Christmas and display the greatest symbol of that Christian Holiday - the Nativity Scene. Atheist groups aided by activist judges, continue to militantly remove more of our Nativity Scenes, Crucifixes, Ten Commandments, or any other hint of Christian faith found in small-town America. The United States of America is known across the globe as the land of ""freedom"", yet in recent years our freedoms are being pulled right out from under us as we move closer and closer to those nations that jail anyone found to be a Christian. The very faith that built this country is now being vanquished by Godless zealots who want nothing more than to vanquish all traces of faith in America. While they impose THEIR minority convictions on the majority 78% of Americans who call themselves Christian, little is done to stop them for fear of litigation. These subversives are succeeding in their efforts for one reason - the generations who fought and died to preserve these symbols are dying off more every day, and few are left who truly understand the dangerous road we are heading down. It was former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev who, in 1960, announced at the United Nations the Soviet Union would conquer the United States without a single shot being fired! One need only observe the trending taking place in America to know this country will one day be conquered from within by the kinds of political radicals we are now seeing in Washington.All too many Americans today are concerned only with their couch, TV, remote control and their beer. No one seems to care as the ""God"" this country was founded on is besmirched, dipped in urine, blasphemed and desecrated under the guise of ""art"" or ""freedom of expression"". When feces was plastered all over a painting of Mary, the Mother of Jesus, and displayed at a New York Art Museum, the artist was hailed for his ""thought-provoking expressionistic work. Yet had that same artist strewn feces all over a portrait of Allah, or dipped a Koran in urine or offered a flippant hypothesis on ""Allah's"" sexuality as they do Jesus, this same media would commence with an unequaled onslaught of denunciations, character assassinations and unending condemnations of anyone who would engage in such unethical, unacceptable, insensitive, racist behavior. They would indubitably ""suggest"" the severest punishment possible for the offender as well, and this drumbeat would cover the media wall-to-wall for days and weeks. Yet this same media says nothing as our Christian beliefs and symbols are blasphemed and desecrated in the name of ""artistic expression"". ... the sheer hypocrisy of the American media knows no bounds!!Unfortunately little is reported today of the new horror spreading over this planet driven by ""radical"" Muslims who use much the same tactics of murder, genocide, rape, mutilation, etc. as a means of intolerance to non-Muslims. One need look no further than those countries that top the list of the World's Ten Worst Human Rights Offenders (Nigeria, Yemen, Myanmar, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Pakistan, The Congo, Sudan and Syria) to see they are all Muslim-based countries overflowing with stories of atrocities against Christians and non-secular Muslims. Innocent men, women and children are being butchered, mutilated and maimed for their faith while the world media REFUSES to report any non-flattering Muslim news that would violate their statute of POLITICAL CORRECTNESS. The events occurring in Africa are purely genocidal and yet because the media looks the other way very few are even aware of it. A recent documentary included interviews with women and young girls who were brutally gang-raped then left to die. Men who were asked to choose ""short sleeves"" or ""long sleeves"" before their arms are chopped off at either the elbows or wrists. Why are there no cries coming from the black community? Why do people like Oprah Winfrey or Barack Hussein Obama make no effort to bring this to the world stage? Who will be their voice?",5,ABSOLUTELY MOVING DRAMA THAT ILLUSTRATES TO WHAT LENGTHS COMMUNISTS WILL GO TO MAINTAIN POWER AND CONTROL,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,8932,"['Father', 'Jerzy',

Popieluszko and yet how he remained faithful to his ideals and calling. It is also a good indication of the situation which the people found themselves in while communism was reigning in Poland.  It also defines the Church's position with regard to the people.  They tried to support the working class in their struggles often surrendering their own lives for the people.

1641079,A2ULQOGN59LDNK,B00BYCOIU6,Richard J. Brzostek,"[1, 1]","Popieluszko Freedom is Within Us (Popieluszko. Wolnosc jest w nas) is one of the most inspirational and memorable movies I have ever watched.  While one would not expect the story of a life of a priest to be full of action and suspense, in the case of Jerzy Popieluszko, it is.  He was watched day and night by the secret police, constantly threatened by the authorities, and ultimately murdered by communist thugs.  Why was the Godless communist government of Poland (imposed by Soviets at the end of World War II) so afraid of a priest?  He gave people hope that Poland would one day be free.  I would go so far as to say that without the courageous clergy, like Father Popieluszko, communism might not have fallen as quickly as it did in Europe.The story reveals how the persecution of Christians is not just some thing that occurred millennia ago (Popieluszko was murdered in 1984).  Even today, with political correctness run amok, the derogatory things said about Christians would never be said about other religions.  Persecution of Christians lives on today and seeing how Popieluszko inspired others to have the strength to stand up to evil is quite amazing.  For me, what is most thought provoking about this movie is that it illustrates how the determination of the faithful can topple a corrupt totalitarian state given enough time.Jerzy Popieluszko is one of the most well known figures in recent Polish history and his story is very much filled with historical events.  I am sure it will appeal to both those who enjoy learning about the past and those who do not, as the story never has a dull moment.  This is a film the whole family can enjoy as the brutal part is done very tastefully (at night where we can not see too much of the actual carnage, but feel the emotion of the event just the same).  Director Rafal Wieczynski created a beautiful tribute to Jerzy Popieluszko with his movie.One of the conclusions I have made from studying Polish history is that the Catholic Church has played an important role in helping the people of Poland in the last thousand years.  Likewise, Poles have played an important part in helping Catholicism (such as their role in 1683 at the Battle of Vienna).  In order to truly understand Poles, one must understand their Christian faith and how important it is and was throughout their history.",5,one of the most inspirational and memorable movies I have ever watched,1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,2348,"['Popieluszko', 'Freedom', 'Within', 'Us', 'Popieluszko', 'Wolnosc', 'jest', 'w', 'nas', 'one', 'most', 'inspirational', 'memorable', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'expect', 'story', 'life', 'priest', 'be', 'full', 'action', 'suspense', 'case', 'Jerzy', 'Popieluszko', 'was', 'watched', 'day', 'night', 'secret', 'police', 'constantly', 'threatened', 'authorities', 'ultimately', 'murdered', 'communist', 'thugs', 'Why', 'was', 'Godless', 'communist', 'government', 'Poland', 'imposed', 'Soviets', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'so', 'afraid', 'priest', 'gave', 'people', 'hope', 'Poland', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'free', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'courageous', 'clergy', 'Father', 'Popieluszko', 'communism', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'fallen', 'as', 'quickly', 'did', 'Europe.The', 'story', 'how', 'persecution', 'Christians', 'not', 'just', 'thing', 'occurred', 'millennia', 'ago', 'Popieluszko', 'was', 'murdered', '1984', 'Even', 'today', 'political', 'correctness', 'run', 'amok', 'derogatory', 'things', 'said', 'Christians', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'said', 'other', 'religions', 'Persecution', 'Christians', 'lives', 'today', 'seeing', 'how', 'Popieluszko', 'inspired', 'others', 'have', 'strength', 'stand', 'up', 'evil', 'quite', 'amazing', 'what', 'most', 'thought', 'provoking', 'movie', 'how', 'determination', 'faithful', 'can', 'topple', 'corrupt', 'totalitarian', 'state', 'given', 'enough', 'time.Jerzy', 'Popieluszko', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'figures', 'recent', 'Polish', 'history', 'story', 'very', 'much', 'filled', 'historical', 'events', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'appeal', 'who', 'enjoy', 'learning', 'past', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'story', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'brutal', 'part', 'done', 'very', 'tastefully', 'night', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'too', 'much', 'actual', 'carnage', 'feel', 'emotion', 'event', 'just', 'same', 'Director', 'Rafal', 'Wieczynski', 'created', 'beautiful', 'tribute', 'Jerzy', 'Popieluszko', 'movie.One', 'conclusions', 'have', 'made', 'studying', 'Polish', 'history', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'played', 'important', 'role', 'helping', 'people', 'Poland', 'last', 'thousand', 'years', 'Likewise', 'Poles', 'have', 'played', 'important', 'part', 'helping', 'Catholicism', 'such', 'role', '1683', 'Battle', 'Vienna', 'order', 'truly', 'understand', 'Poles', 'one', 'must', 'understand', 'Christian', 'faith', 'how', 'important', 'was', 'history']",Popieluszko: Freedom is Within Us

1641081,A2UITTZE0YDER2,B00BYCOIU6,"ServusDei ""udayajmj""","[20, 20]","Eastern European cinema generally tends to be in a class of their own when compared to Hollywood and Western European films. A lot of artistry goes into their productions as well as being 'thinking' movies....making the viewer not just appreciate what's on screen at the present moment, but to make the movie remain with them for a long time after.To make a biopic of any one always poses a challenge. This is more so if the person is a hero and, in the case of Popieluszko, a beatified martyr. However this movie flows with an incredible fluidity, without adulterating or romanticizing the facts and the events. A beautiful aspect of this film is incorporating footage of actual events that happened in the tumultuous 80's in Poland, along with the Papal visits by Blessed John Paul II with the movie, that there is no `break'. One cannot really discern, in certain parts of the movie, which is archival footage and which is the film. This is a remarkable achievement in cinematic art, as far as I am concerned.From this film, one can learn much about the character of Bl.Jerzy Popieluszko. A very brave young man, who was an average priest in the opinion of many, but who did extraordinary deeds of heroism for the liberation of his homeland from the tyranny of communism. We also see his very human side of suffering, compassion, fear, anger and even a slight sense of vanity.Though the facade of this priest speaks the contrary, we are surprised to see the stuff this man is made off.  This movie beautifully expresses the underlying fervent catholicity of a nation, despite the coldness of its exterior, and how freedom and faith is both expressed with such passion, that we can easily affirm that both are inviolably linked to each other.Also expressed and wonderfully depicted, is the love the Polish people have for their traditions of faith, their love and respect of their language, culture and nation. Certain scenes pertaining to this are quite amusing as well as awe inspiring. Also, the heroism of the many priests of those days; from the Pope, to the Bishops and ordinary priests as well as the religious sisters is amazing. The words of Christ : ""This is the greatest love a man can show, that he should lay down his life for his friends"" (St. John 15:13), brings us to a whole new perspective of what sacrifice really means.The words used in my review's heading comes from a scene when Bl. Jerzy is asked how come he feels no anger for his persecutors for which he answers ""I fight evil, not the victims of evil"". He saw his tormentors as victims themselves, to be pitied and to be helped. Truly a mark of sainthood!This movie is 149 minutes long, in Polish with subtitles in English and Spanish.Special features include:1)The making of the film (21 mins)2)A documentary:Victors don't die: The story of Fr.Jerzy Popieluszko (50mins)I am not too fond of these features because only one voice over(male) was used for both features, for all the different people, both men and women.Also Included is a 16 page booklet which includes the following chapters:1.About Poland, Patriotism and Catholicism2.An Unlikely hero3.In his own words4.The rise of solidarity5.Chronology of events6.Discussion questionsThis is a movie that will make any catholic proud and more so any Polish.For a documentary on Blessed Jerzy I highly recommendJERZY POPIELUSZLO: MESSENGER OF TRUTH*A POLISH MARTYR AND 21ST CENTURY HERO DVD.",5,To fight evil and not the victims of evil,1367971200,"05 8, 2013",2013,3421,"['Eastern', 'European', 'cinema', 'generally', 'be', 'class', 'own', 'when', 'compared', 'Hollywood', 'Western', 'European', 'films', 'lot', 'artistry', 'productions', 'as', 'well', 'being', ""'thinking"", 'movies', '.making', 'viewer', 'not', 'just', 'appreciate', 'what', 'screen', 'present', 'moment', 'make', 'movie', 'remain', 'long', 'time', 'after.To', 'make', 'biopic', 'one', 'always', 'challenge', 'more', 'so', 'person', 'hero', 'case', 'Popieluszko', 'beatified', 'martyr', 'However', 'movie', 'incredible', 'fluidity', 'adulterating', 'romanticizing', 'facts', 'events', 'beautiful', 'aspect', 'film', 'incorporating', 'footage', 'actual', 'events', 'happened', 'tumultuous', '80', 'Poland', 'Papal', 'visits', 'Blessed', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'movie', 'break', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'discern', 'certain', 'parts', 'movie', 'archival', 'footage', 'film', 'remarkable', 'achievement', 'cinematic', 'art', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned.From', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'learn', 'much', 'character', 'Bl.Jerzy', 'Popieluszko', 'very', 'brave', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'average', 'priest', 'opinion', 'many', 'who', 'did', 'extraordinary', 'deeds', 'heroism', 'liberation', 'homeland', 'tyranny', 'communism', 'also', 'see', 'very', 'human', 'side', 'suffering', 'compassion', 'fear', 'anger', 'even', 'slight', 'sense', 'facade', 'priest', 'contrary', 'are', 'surprised', 'see', 'stuff', 'man', 'made', 'off', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'underlying', 'fervent', 'catholicity', 'nation', 'coldness', 'exterior', 'how', 'freedom', 'faith', 'expressed', 'such', 'passion', 'can', 'easily', 'affirm', 'are', 'inviolably', 'linked', 'other.Also', 'expressed', 'wonderfully', 'depicted', 'love', 'Polish', 'people', 'have', 'traditions', 'faith', 'love', 'respect', 'language', 'culture', 'nation', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'pertaining', 'are', 'quite', 'amusing', 'as', 'well', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'Also', 'heroism', 'many', 'priests', 'days', 'Pope', 'Bishops', 'ordinary', 'priests', 'as', 'well', 'religious', 'sisters', 'amazing', 'words', 'Christ', 'greatest', 'love', 'man', 'can', 'show', 'should', 'lay', 'down', 'life', 'friends', 'St.', 'John', '15:13', 'whole', 'new', 'perspective', 'what', 'sacrifice', 'really', 'means.The', 'words', 'used', 'review', 'heading', 'scene', 'when', 'Bl', 'Jerzy', 'asked', 'how', 'come', 'anger', 'persecutors', 'fight', 'evil', 'not', 'victims', 'evil', 'saw', 'tormentors', 'victims', 'be', 'pitied', 'be', 'helped', 'Truly', 'mark', 'sainthood', 'movie', '149', 'minutes', 'long', 'Polish', 'subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish.Special', 'features', 'include:1', 'making', 'film', '21', 'mins', '2', 'documentary', 'Victors', 'do', ""n't"", 'die', 'story', 'Fr.Jerzy', 'Popieluszko', '50mins', 'am', 'not', 'too', 'fond', 'features', 'only', 'one', 'voice', 'male', 'was', 'used', 'features', 'different', 'people', 'men', 'women.Also', 'Included', '16', 'page', 'booklet', 'following', 'chapters:1.About', 'Poland', 'Patriotism', 'Catholicism2.An', 'Unlikely', 'hero3.In', 'own', 'words4.The', 'rise', 'solidarity5.Chronology', 'events6.Discussion', 'questionsThis', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'catholic', 'proud', 'more', 'so', 'Polish.For', 'documentary', 'Blessed', 'Jerzy', 'highly', 'recommendJERZY', 'POPIELUSZLO', 'MESSENGER', 'TRUTH*A', 'POLISH', 'MARTYR', '21ST', 'CENTURY', 'HERO', 'DVD']",Popieluszko: Freedom is Within Us
