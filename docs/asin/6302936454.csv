Here, we have a little girl who not only recently lost her father, but was moved from the southern Mexican she knew back to the U.S. to a life that was strange to her.  So, she withdrew into herself.  To reach anyone like that, indeed to reach anyone who needs help, one must be able to reach out them on their level and within their capacity.  In this case, that of supposed autism, the mother had to learn to think as an autistic child.  Only then would she be able to reach her hurting daughter.  The movie holds one's interest, even if you don't understand the means used by the mother to reach her daughter to help her break through her grieving to start to heal.",4,"Good Premise, but a bit hard to understand mechanics.",1182211200,"06 19, 2007",2007,784,"['would', 'say', 'basics', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'mechanics', 'left', 'wife', 'puzzled', 'Here', 'have', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'recently', 'lost', 'father', 'was', 'moved', 'southern', 'Mexican', 'knew', 'back', 'U.S.', 'life', 'was', 'strange', 'So', 'withdrew', 'reach', 'anyone', 'indeed', 'reach', 'anyone', 'who', 'help', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'able', 'reach', 'out', 'level', 'capacity', 'case', 'supposed', 'autism', 'mother', 'had', 'learn', 'think', 'autistic', 'child', 'Only', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'reach', 'hurting', 'daughter', 'movie', 'one', 'interest', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'means', 'used', 'mother', 'reach', 'daughter', 'help', 'break', 'grieving', 'start', 'heal']",N/A

Little Sally Matthews deals with the loss of her father by refusing to speak.

Listen carefully to what the South American shaman says to Sally about communicating with her father who has gone to live among the stars. The scene where Sally ""becomes"" a tree is a Sally who has found her center and is in complete oneness with herself and the world.

346572,A1K5DUV1L52MUD,6302936454,"Bonnie Sayers ""autismfamily""","[3, 11]","I was confused from the start with House of Cards. Kathleen Turner stars as the widowed parent Ruth Matthews to six year-old Sally and her older brother Michael. They are somewhere in Mexico preparing to return home to North Carolina after a three year absence.The father, Alex died while they were in Mexico while on an archealogical dig of Mayan ruins. They stayed awhile longer in Mexico after the accident that Ruth had witnessed. I did not connect with the child actress Asha Menina and felt the child was a bit off before they even arrived back in the States. The viewer was aware of her inner thoughts through her whisperings in her mind and she spoke to three weird looking dolls that were spooky. The times that House of Cards ventured into these eerie scenes reminded me of a young Sissie Spacek in Carrie, and I did not want the movie to turn in that direction.The story was interesting, but failed on so many levels and left viewer not sure what was reality and fantasy and why autism was even suggested. Although the subject was of interest to me, this did contain poor casting choices and not enough character development.There was such limited information concerning the father and his death and no family discussions about memories. This is where development lacked and could have been explored further. I could not even form an opinion on the father since flashbacks only showed a flashlight and legs falling down.Ruth had a fear of heights, but it was not explained what led to this. She also did not want Sally and Michael to cry over the death of their father. I think the reason why I was not drawn to the character of Sally is the way she was presented. It was mentioned that she knew three languages, and you heard her muttering to herself in these, but they did not portray her favorably before she withdrew into herself once they were back home.The next adult we meet is a neighbor played by Park Overall, the only perfectly suited actor in a role in House of Cards. I would have rather seen the mother portrayed by one of the actresses who starred in Designing Women, because Kathleen Turner's accent just bugs me too much.Their house was very large with a lot of land and we only ever saw the kitchen and Sally's bedroom along with the porch. It made no sense for Sally to be sleeping in the attic with access to a window, especially after several incidents where she got out and climbed on the roof.The first few scenes upon their arrival back home showed Sally in this crouching position, she resembled a china doll when was picked up and returned to the same form. I thought it was very weird until they showed her mother in the same position a few times. Nothing really made sense in House of Cards and many loose ends were left hanging for this viewer.I felt the scenes where they showed students working at the school with therapists was decent, although they did push in the wrong direction when trying to get an echolaic child to ask for water, when clearly the child wanted to drink. I do not agree with the concept of withholding something from a child when they cannot communicate that need.I did choose to view House of Cards because of the mention of autistic traits, and glad that the cover of the video did not mention autism since that was not the basis of the character or show. The parent/child bond lacked structure, was hard to follow that a child missed a parent so much when there were no flashbacks hinting to a relationship.",3,The House of Cards fell down quickly,1098144000,"10 19, 2004",2004,3475,"['was', 'confused', 'start', 'House', 'Cards', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'widowed', 'parent', 'Ruth', 'Matthews', 'six', 'year-old', 'Sally', 'older', 'brother', 'Michael', 'are', 'somewhere', 'Mexico', 'preparing', 'return', 'home', 'North', 'Carolina', 'three', 'year', 'absence.The', 'father', 'Alex', 'died', 'were', 'Mexico', 'archealogical', 'dig', 'Mayan', 'ruins', 'stayed', 'awhile', 'longer', 'Mexico', 'accident', 'Ruth', 'had', 'witnessed', 'did', 'not', 'connect', 'child', 'actress', 'Asha', 'Menina', 'felt', 'child', 'was', 'bit', 'off', 'even', 'arrived', 'back', 'States', 'viewer', 'was', 'aware', 'inner', 'thoughts', 'whisperings', 'mind', 'spoke', 'three', 'weird', 'looking', 'dolls', 'were', 'spooky', 'times', 'House', 'Cards', 'ventured', 'eerie', 'scenes', 'reminded', 'young', 'Sissie', 'Spacek', 'Carrie', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'movie', 'turn', 'direction.The', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'failed', 'many', 'levels', 'left', 'viewer', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'why', 'autism', 'was', 'even', 'suggested', 'subject', 'was', 'interest', 'did', 'contain', 'poor', 'casting', 'choices', 'not', 'enough', 'character', 'development.There', 'was', 'such', 'limited', 'information', 'concerning', 'father', 'death', 'family', 'discussions', 'memories', 'where', 'development', 'lacked', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'further', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'form', 'opinion', 'father', 'flashbacks', 'only', 'showed', 'flashlight', 'legs', 'falling', 'down.Ruth', 'had', 'fear', 'heights', 'was', 'not', 'explained', 'what', 'led', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'Sally', 'Michael', 'cry', 'death', 'father', 'think', 'reason', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'drawn', 'character', 'Sally', 'way', 'was', 'presented', 'was', 'mentioned', 'knew', 'three', 'languages', 'heard', 'muttering', 'herself', 'did', 'not', 'portray', 'favorably', 'withdrew', 'once', 'were', 'back', 'home.The', 'next', 'adult', 'meet', 'neighbor', 'played', 'Park', 'Overall', 'only', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'actor', 'role', 'House', 'Cards', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'seen', 'mother', 'portrayed', 'one', 'actresses', 'who', 'starred', 'Designing', 'Women', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'accent', 'just', 'bugs', 'too', 'much.Their', 'house', 'was', 'very', 'large', 'lot', 'land', 'only', 'ever', 'saw', 'kitchen', 'Sally', 'bedroom', 'porch', 'made', 'sense', 'Sally', 'be', 'sleeping', 'attic', 'access', 'window', 'especially', 'several', 'incidents', 'where', 'got', 'out', 'climbed', 'roof.The', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'arrival', 'back', 'home', 'showed', 'Sally', 'crouching', 'position', 'resembled', 'china', 'doll', 'when', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'returned', 'same', 'form', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'weird', 'showed', 'mother', 'same', 'position', 'few', 'times', 'Nothing', 'really', 'made', 'sense', 'House', 'Cards', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'were', 'left', 'hanging', 'viewer.I', 'felt', 'scenes', 'where', 'showed', 'students', 'working', 'school', 'therapists', 'was', 'decent', 'did', 'push', 'wrong', 'direction', 'when', 'trying', 'get', 'echolaic', 'child', 'ask', 'water', 'when', 'clearly', 'child', 'wanted', 'drink', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'concept', 'withholding', 'something', 'child', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'communicate', 'need.I', 'did', 'choose', 'view', 'House', 'Cards', 'mention', 'autistic', 'traits', 'glad', 'cover', 'video', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'autism', 'was', 'not', 'basis', 'character', 'show', 'parent/child', 'bond', 'lacked', 'structure', 'was', 'hard', 'follow', 'child', 'missed', 'parent', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'were', 'flashbacks', 'hinting', 'relationship']",N/A

Let it go.**Spoilers!**This is a movie about a little girl who grows up around Mayan tradition, and who is taken away from that back to the States when her father is killed. A lot of the story takes place in memories, visions and dreams, so it only makes ""sense"" in the context of the Mayan teachings the little girl grew up with. It doesn't translate well to the late 20th Century USA - that's the whole point of the movie. It works in spite of the fact that none of the adults around this little girl have a clue what is happening, even though it's spelled out on the tapes of Sally and the old Mayan man.She isn't autistic - she's in a trance, on a vision quest. When she and her mother work out the grief, she comes out of it. That's a natural result of such a journey. The ending is beautiful and poetic. The problem is that if you aren't familiar with shamanic traditions, or you don't pay close attention to what the child is hearing and seeing, you won't know what's happening. No one sums it up, and the people around the little girl never pick up on the symbols involved in her healing - cards, The Tower, The Moon- nor do they understand the process they've just gone through.The child knew enough to heal herself in spite of the adults around her, and her mother facilitates this by following her own intuition in reaching the girl.
