This is a fine concert with great picture and sound and I recommend this to any fan who does not own a Taylor DVD.  However, if you own &quot;James Taylor Live At The Beacon&quot; I see no reason to purchase this edition unless you are hardcore JT fan.  The Dvd format which is a fantastic medium for concert and digital sound has caused record companies to release live concerts one after another by the same artist to $cash$ in because they know loyal fans will buy everything they put out.  Take my word for it and that is, If you  have the Beacon DVD [which is fantastic] you will not need &quot;Pull Over&quot; unless you like duplication?",4,"Vintage James Taylor, But?",1037750400,"11 20, 2002",2002,802,"['found', 'James', 'Taylor', 'latest', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Pull', 'Over', 'quot', 'loaded', 'many', 'hits', 'songs', 'promote', 'latest', 'cd', 'quot', 'October', 'Road', 'quot', 'fine', 'concert', 'great', 'picture', 'sound', 'recommend', 'fan', 'who', 'not', 'own', 'Taylor', 'DVD', 'However', 'own', 'quot', 'James', 'Taylor', 'Live', 'Beacon', 'quot', 'see', 'reason', 'purchase', 'edition', 'are', 'hardcore', 'JT', 'fan', 'Dvd', 'format', 'fantastic', 'medium', 'concert', 'digital', 'sound', 'caused', 'record', 'companies', 'release', 'live', 'concerts', 'one', 'same', 'artist', 'cash', 'know', 'loyal', 'fans', 'will', 'buy', 'everything', 'put', 'out', 'Take', 'word', 'have', 'Beacon', 'DVD', '[', 'fantastic', ']', 'will', 'not', 'need', 'quot', 'Pull', 'Over', 'quot', 'duplication']",James Taylor - Pull Over
724542,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B000077VQ5,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[0, 0]","James Taylor's second live dvd, 2002's ""Pull Over,"" could very easily have been a gold standard for all future live dvds; unfortunately despite having a wonder performance and set list, the dvd itself falls a bit short in many aspects.As others have pointed out, the picture is horribly matted and does not take advantage of the widescreen format, making for a very awkward viewing experience. The picture quality itself is very good, but the camerawork is subpar and contains many unnecessary cuts and edits that distract from the performance, which really represents Taylor at his best.With all that said, ""Pull Over"" is first and foremost about the performance itself, which as I've already mentioned is fantastic. The sound quality is crystal clear, and the music is top notch. Taylor and his band are in perfect synch throughout, and the set list is a great mix of old favorites, then new recordings, and obscure fan favorites. Surrounding old favorites like ""Fire and Rain,"" ""Carolina in My Mind,"" and ""Sweet Baby James"" are a healthy dose of his underrated late 1980s'-1990s' material, including haunting renditions of ""The Frozen Man,"" ""Shed a Little Light,"" and ""Copperline."" The new material from the then unreleased ""October Road"" holds its own well, and the old favorites sound as lively as ever; Taylor is one artist who's never really phoned in a song no matter how many times he's performed it. Even though the picture quality leaves quite a bit to be desired, it is clear that Taylor and his band have a fondness and respect for each other both personally and professionally, and that chemistry comes through in these performances.So while it may not be the best viewing experience technically, ""Pull Over"" is still a superb performance filled with energy and excitement. Throw it on a top notch soundtrack and just listen.",4,Better Heard than Seen.,1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,1839,"['James', 'Taylor', 'second', 'live', 'dvd', '2002', 'Pull', 'Over', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'gold', 'standard', 'future', 'live', 'dvds', 'unfortunately', 'having', 'wonder', 'performance', 'set', 'list', 'dvd', 'bit', 'short', 'many', 'aspects.As', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'picture', 'horribly', 'matted', 'not', 'take', 'advantage', 'widescreen', 'format', 'making', 'very', 'awkward', 'viewing', 'experience', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'camerawork', 'subpar', 'many', 'unnecessary', 'cuts', 'edits', 'distract', 'performance', 'really', 'Taylor', 'best.With', 'said', 'Pull', 'first', 'foremost', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'already', 'mentioned', 'fantastic', 'sound', 'quality', 'crystal', 'clear', 'music', 'top', 'notch', 'Taylor', 'band', 'are', 'perfect', 'synch', 'set', 'list', 'great', 'mix', 'old', 'favorites', 'then', 'new', 'recordings', 'obscure', 'fan', 'favorites', 'Surrounding', 'old', 'favorites', 'Fire', 'Rain', 'Carolina', 'My', 'Mind', 'Sweet', 'Baby', 'James', 'are', 'healthy', 'dose', 'underrated', 'late', ""1980s'-1990s"", 'material', 'including', 'haunting', 'renditions', 'Frozen', 'Man', 'Shed', 'Little', 'Light', 'Copperline', 'new', 'material', 'then', 'unreleased', 'October', 'Road', 'own', 'well', 'old', 'favorites', 'sound', 'as', 'lively', 'ever', 'Taylor', 'one', 'artist', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'phoned', 'song', 'no', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'performed', 'Even', 'picture', 'quality', 'quite', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'clear', 'Taylor', 'band', 'have', 'fondness', 'respect', 'other', 'personally', 'professionally', 'chemistry', 'performances.So', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'viewing', 'experience', 'technically', 'Pull', 'still', 'superb', 'performance', 'filled', 'energy', 'excitement', 'Throw', 'top', 'notch', 'soundtrack', 'just', 'listen']",James Taylor - Pull Over
724543,ALR35EFI69S5R,B000077VQ5,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[11, 12]","Sweet Baby James is back, this time with yet another terrific concert performance of his ever-growing catalogue of unforgettable songs. While he is easily one of the most successful of all of the record selling artists of the last thirty years, he is also one of the hardest working live performers in the business, and is in perpetual demand throughout the country, indeed, the world, as a first class draw for huge crowds. I haven't had the pleasure of seeing him sing live in decades, but always anticipate his new record releases and DVDs such as these in order to stay in touch with this most singular talent. Like the late John Denver, Taylor approaches the stage with enthusiasm and a charismatic charm that is simply hard for me to resist. Needless to say, I succumbed to the temptations herein pretty quickly.Included here are many works not previously available on DVD, such as ""Frozen Man"" here with a funny and yet poignant introduction that shows how well Taylor succeeds at broaching bittersweet and often meaningful subjects with a touch of humor and satire. Also new here is ""You Can Close Your Eyes"", ""Millworker"", and ""That's Why I'm Here"", all delivered with the typical flawless Taylor rendition. Of course, the panoply of perpetual favorite favorites like ""Fire And Rain"", ""Copperline"", ""Everyday"", ""You've Got A Friend"", and ""Sweet Baby James"" are all here, as are many others, for a total of some two dozen songs or so. Old JT is aging, as are we all, but he has mellowed even more over the years, and by prevailing over his own demons and continuing to do what he does like no one else can, has once again offered us a gift that I urge you to go out and grab for your very own.

Forgive me if it sounds like I'm going off the deep end here, but my goodness, the music he writes touches me. What &quot;Pull Over&quot; adds to what we already know is that James Taylor is also incredibly well-spoken, wonderful with his audience and very, very funny. He's just so at ease, when a member of the audience prematurely shouts out a request for &quot;Copper Line,&quot; Taylor reaches for the set list and points out that &quot;Copper Line&quot; isn't until the second set.

Then this is a must have DVD!I bought his first, very highly rated DVD, Live at the Beacon Theatre, and enjoyed it so much I just had to have this one even though people said if you own one there is no need to buy another.  I must disagree...both offers something unique.That said, I feel this is the better of the two DVDs currently offered and here's why:The songs are awesome.  Frozen Man is just outstanding.  Millworker is such a great song.  The version of the popular Fire and Rain is better on Live at, but this one is more in line with the original version.James Taylor seems much more relaxed and animated at this concert.The visual impact of the stage is more pleasant with the color and openness of the stage.The only negative with this DVD is the same as Live at, and that is the constant quick change of camera angles.  There are dozens of shots in each song.

Well, I'm glad I did - even if some of the songs are duplicated, there is still enough different material, plus different arrangements, to make this well worthwhile.  James and the band are more relaxed and spontaneous in Pull Over, and look like they are having a lot more fun during this tour (this dvd is a taken from several concerts) than at the Beacon.  Although it is very sad to have lost Carlos Vega, it is also a treat to see Russ Kunkel back on the drums just like he was 30+ years ago on Taylor's earlier albums.One reviewer commented that the sound was not as good on this dvd and sounded like it had been heavily processed.  To me, the mixing is uneven - on some songs, especially at the beginning, the mix is muffled (lacks crispness, the bass is way too strong and the instruments don't seem well defined, plus Taylor's voice sounds like it is in the background) but on others, it is first rate.
