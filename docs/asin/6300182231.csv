It was the first film I ever saw that effectively conveyed the inner workings of washington politics- How things actually get done.Its theme- What happens when idealism clashes with personal ambition? - is still relevant in these times. Joe Tynan will remind you of many politicians on the cusp of national prominence.The film's plot entails a liberal U.S. Senator from New York who sees a political opportunity in leading the opposition to a controversial supreme court nominee. After he succeeds, it then explores the personal consequences of the higher political profile this action has brought.Alan Alda (who wrote the script- his best- I don't how the same guy wrote ""Betsy's Wedding"")- gave a very nuanced, three dimensional performance as Joe Tynan. The character is a likeable, idealistic fellow being ""seduced"" ever so slowly by presidential ambition. How much is he willing to sacrifice for the ultimate prize?This film should be required viewing for West Wing fans who'd like to see Mr. Alda in another political role.Meryl Streep is excellent as Joe Tynan's colleague/lover.

201064,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6300182231,David Baldwin,"[0, 0]","New York Senator Joe Tynan(Alan Alda) probably has a perfect rating with the ACLU.  Tynan is vulnerable to special interests, though.  There are elements  lurking in the high grass who are more liberal than he, namely a sexy civil rights lawyer from Louisiana(Meryl Streep), who want to pull him to the dark side.  Huh?! Wouldn't the film be more compelling if he were influenced by Tea Party types?  Maybe in Alda's world there are only Democrats and other Democrats.  This may not be too far from the truth when you consider the film was made in a post Watergate environment where elected Republicans were as rare as white flies.  Regardless, the central premise is pretty flimsy because it seemed to me that Tynan was already full of himself and power tripping when he met the lawyer and all he needed was a little nudge.  In essence Alda plays Tynan as Hawkeye Pierce in a Brooks Brothers suit but there is a compelling supporting cast.  All terrific are Barbara Harris as Tynan's long suffering wife, Melvyn Douglas as a senior Senator losing his faculties, Rip Torn as a skirt chasing Southern Senator, and Blanche Baker as Tynan's troubled teen daughter.  If memory serves I think Baker is the daughter of Carole Baker.

201066,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,6300182231,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[9, 14]","If you're into politics, you might enjoy this film.  Supposedly, its a very realistic view of the U.S. Senate and as such, it'll be interesting for those of us who consider Allen Drury to be light reading.  As a film, though, its somewhat draggy and very much a product of the late, self-righteous 1970s.  Alan Alda is a young Senator named Joe Tynan, an ambitious liberal who has an affair with Meryl Streep that leads to his perfect world starting to collapse around him.  There's not really much of a plot to the film -- its mostly a collection of scenes of Tynan campaigning, cheating, and legislating.  Some films work without a clearly defined plot but this film just seems to be sort of a mess.  Alan Alda was brave to play a character who is, occasionally, rather unsympathetic but at the same time, Tynan still carries a lot of the smug, self-righteousness that Alda brought to the final seasons of M*A*S*H so if you disliked Alda on that show, this movie probably isn't for you.  That said, this film also contains one of Meryl Streep's few truly genuine, human performances (she doesn't fall back on the obvious &quot;actorly&quot; technique that's marred recent performances) and she's actually quite sexy in a role that I'm sure screenwriter Alda thought would come across as &quot;liberated&quot; but actually smacks of a certain unacknowledged sexism (for she may be a smart, accomplished, independent activist but she's still basically there to have sex with and sing the praises of Joe Tynan).  Two of Alda's fellow Senators are played brilliantly by Melvyn Douglas and Rip Torn (who at times seemes to be playing Pennsylvania's own Snarlin' Arlen Specter though the film actually predates Specter's election).  Highly praised at the time, the film is mostly forgotten today but it has its occasional moments.",3,Okay political film,1001635200,"09 28, 2001",2001,1826,"[""'re"", 'politics', 'might', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Supposedly', 'very', 'realistic', 'view', 'U.S.', 'Senate', 'such', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interesting', 'who', 'consider', 'Allen', 'Drury', 'be', 'light', 'reading', 'film', 'though', 'somewhat', 'draggy', 'very', 'much', 'product', 'late', 'self-righteous', '1970s', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'young', 'Senator', 'named', 'Joe', 'Tynan', 'ambitious', 'liberal', 'who', 'affair', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'perfect', 'world', 'starting', 'collapse', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'plot', 'film', 'mostly', 'collection', 'scenes', 'Tynan', 'campaigning', 'cheating', 'legislating', 'films', 'work', 'clearly', 'defined', 'plot', 'film', 'just', 'be', 'sort', 'mess', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'was', 'brave', 'play', 'character', 'who', 'occasionally', 'rather', 'unsympathetic', 'same', 'time', 'Tynan', 'still', 'lot', 'smug', 'self-righteousness', 'Alda', 'brought', 'final', 'seasons', 'M*A*S*H', 'disliked', 'Alda', 'show', 'movie', 'probably', ""n't"", 'said', 'film', 'also', 'one', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'few', 'truly', 'genuine', 'human', 'performances', ""n't"", 'fall', 'back', 'obvious', 'quot', 'actorly', 'quot', 'technique', 'marred', 'recent', 'performances', 'actually', 'quite', 'sexy', 'role', ""'m"", 'sure', 'screenwriter', 'Alda', 'thought', 'would', 'come', 'quot', 'liberated', 'quot', 'actually', 'smacks', 'certain', 'unacknowledged', 'sexism', 'may', 'be', 'smart', 'accomplished', 'independent', 'activist', 'still', 'basically', 'there', 'have', 'sex', 'sing', 'praises', 'Joe', 'Tynan', 'Two', 'Alda', 'fellow', 'Senators', 'are', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'who', 'times', 'seemes', 'be', 'playing', 'Pennsylvania', 'own', 'Snarlin', 'Arlen', 'Specter', 'film', 'actually', 'Specter', 'election', 'praised', 'time', 'film', 'mostly', 'forgotten', 'today', 'occasional', 'moments']",N/A

201068,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,6300182231,Muzzlehatch,"[2, 2]","The poster - reproduced on the VHS boxcover - for this 1979 political/romance drama is pretty interesting, with the faces of the three principals in a row, the central one unsmiling, and the words ""There are many ways to be seduced.  Fame. Power. Love.  Joe Tynan knows them all.""It's kind of an interesting image, and certainly an evocative tagline, for what turns out unfortunately to be a problematic and only intermittently successful film.  The ingredients are fine and surely must have boded well at the time: star/writer Alan Alda was still in the midst of his success on M*A*S*H and had starred in two of the bigger commercial and critical successes of the previous year, CALIFORNIA SUITE and SAME TIME, NEXT YEAR; costar Barbara Harris was a Tony winner, multiple Golden Globe nominee and Oscar nominee; Melvyn Douglas had won an Oscar and been nominated for another and was to win a second Oscar for BEING THERE in 1979, the same year this film was released; Rip Torn was making a name as a prominent character actor and eccentric lead; and then there was a young actress named Meryl Streep, who won her first Oscar in 1979 also.  The director was Jerry Schatzberg, winner of the Palme d'or at Cannes in 1973 for SCARECROW and widely known for the gritty junkie drama PANIC IN NEEDLE PARK which had helped make Al Pacino a star.  The music was by Bill Conti, Oscar nominee a couple of years earlier for the memorable theme song ""Gonna Fly Now"" from ROCKY.But it doesn't all add up, alas, despite fine work from the principal actors, especially Harris as Ellie, the beleaguered wife of  up-and-coming Senator Joe Tynan (Alda), who is seduced at first simply by the prospect of winning an important battle over a Supreme Court nomination and eventually also by an aide in that battle, southern lawyer Karen Traynor (Streep) and ultimately the prospect of running for President.  It's an old story, or stories: man corrupted by power and arrogance, and man having to choose power and career over love and family, and alas Alda's screenplay hits all the major keys without really getting the minor notes that would provide more feeling and richness to the story.  Alda is fine as the would-be Kennedy-type also, and Streep added to her already-impressive resume with a light southern accent and a lot of humor and panache in the flashiest and most-admired role in the film, but as I said for me Harris is the one who really shines, walking a difficult path between appearing too ""shrewish"" and controlling and just being the concerned wife.  It would have been fairly easy to make Ellie seem out of control and allow her to be sympathetic in all the wrong ways but Harris never goes down that path, and in the end she is probably the most ambivalent and hard-to-read character in the film - which I think is entirely appropriate in a story about facades and pretense.Schatzerg's direction doesn't help matters any; the film's subject may not call for a stylistic genius but a lot of scenes here just come off very flat, in particular a would-be comic interlude with Alda and Streep trying to find a quiet getaway at a country club.  There's also a narrative choice that I think doesn't really work given the very straightforward story - and the fact that we know most of our characters are lying to themselves and each other most of the time.  The way Ellie finds out about the affair is really elided and seems to rely on just her noticing a couple of glances and hand signals here or there from a distance - there's never a discussion of anything, she just blows up and it comes off as highly unrealistic; unless we're supposed to assume that she's just more intuitive than most because she's a psychologist.  Much of the rest of the film suffers from this same kind of lazy storytelling; the stress in the family is just assumed because we know that daddy's a Senator, but it's not well articulated, and it doesn't help matters that Blanche Baker as the Tynans' daughter Janet is very unconvincing, seeming to change ages between about 12 and 18 from scene to scene.The music by Conti is awfully strange as well; it's a neat little theme, but it sounds closer to Renaissance fayre or English folk revival than the music for a serious political film.  I can't recall when outside of certain exploitation films I've heard a more inappropriate score.  All in all then, THE SEDUCTION OF JOE TYNAN is rather a mess that does justice neither to the political or relationship dimensions of the story.  It's saved from hopelessness by the terrific performance by Harris and the very good ones by Streep, Alda, Douglas and Torn (who has a couple of great little ""character"" scenes that seem written just for him), but still I'm not sure how strongly I'd recommend it to people in general if the cast doesn't interest them.For all of my problems with the film, it certainly does deserve to be on DVD, as Meryl Streep's performance is certainly an important one in her career's trajectory, and who knows?  A nicely transferred widescreen presentation, with commentary by any or all of the three principals and the director would be something that even some viewers like me who are ambivalent about the film might be willing to take a gander at.",3,Terrific cast buoys this muddled political morality play,1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,5242,"['poster', 'reproduced', 'VHS', 'boxcover', '1979',
