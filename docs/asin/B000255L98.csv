824792,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000255L98,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[5, 7]","This 2004 movie so universally depicts grief within a family, silent grief that manifests itself in different manners for each family member.  It could be made anywhere.  Throughout the duration of the movie, the director Nir Bergman, (his first film) has given the viewer a clear semblance of a family's depression and their lack of mechanisms for coping.  We don't need to hear the words to grief and depression, we simply feel it.Nine months ago, on a family ride, the father was killed by a bee sting.  Dafna, the wife and mother is struggling with a car that needs work, a job as a midwife and the ever-present demands of a family of four that includes two teenagers and two youngsters.  And like any single-parent family, the oldest children assume a greater role in childcare of the younger ones.Tragedy strikes again and we see their lives compounded with more stress and grief.Teenager Maya wants to be a singer and musician, but she is filled with guilt as we later learn that it was she who needed the potty and caused her father to get out of the car.  She breaks from her dreams because she knows her brother and sister need care.The older brother Yair dropped out of school and takes a job delivering brochures dressed as a mouse.  His communication gets more bizarre.  And it's clear that this costume becomes his mask for coping.The DVD format is crisp and clear, subtitles are very easy to read with no distractions.  There isn't much else and it would have been great to hear commentary about this wonderful movie that is so universal.  The movie has won numerous awards  ....Rizzo",5,Saddened effects of a tragedy,1124668800,"08 22, 2005",2005,1599,"['2004', 'movie', 'so', 'universally', 'grief', 'family', 'silent', 'grief', 'different', 'manners', 'family', 'member', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'anywhere', 'duration', 'movie', 'director', 'Nir', 'Bergman', 'first', 'film', 'given', 'viewer', 'clear', 'semblance', 'family', 'depression', 'lack', 'mechanisms', 'coping', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'hear', 'words', 'grief', 'depression', 'simply', 'feel', 'it.Nine', 'months', 'ago', 'family', 'ride', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'bee', 'sting', 'Dafna', 'wife', 'mother', 'struggling', 'car', 'work', 'job', 'midwife', 'ever-present', 'demands', 'family', 'four', 'two', 'teenagers', 'two', 'youngsters', 'single-parent', 'family', 'oldest', 'children', 'assume', 'greater', 'role', 'childcare', 'younger', 'ones.Tragedy', 'strikes', 'again', 'see', 'lives', 'compounded', 'more', 'stress', 'grief.Teenager', 'Maya', 'be', 'singer', 'musician', 'filled', 'guilt', 'later', 'learn', 'was', 'who', 'needed', 'potty', 'caused', 'father', 'get', 'car', 'dreams', 'brother', 'sister', 'need', 'care.The', 'older', 'brother', 'Yair', 'dropped', 'school', 'job', 'delivering', 'brochures', 'dressed', 'mouse', 'communication', 'more', 'bizarre', 'clear', 'costume', 'mask', 'coping.The', 'DVD', 'format', 'crisp', 'clear', 'subtitles', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'read', 'distractions', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'hear', 'commentary', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'so', 'universal', 'movie', 'won', 'numerous', 'awards', '.Rizzo']",N/A

824795,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B000255L98,Andy Orrock,"[6, 7]","Writer/Director Nir Bergman's ""Knafayim Shvurot"" (Broken Wings) swept the Israeli film awards in 2002 and made its way to US theaters in 2004.  One thinks ""award winning Israeli film"" and immediately is drawn to the conclusion that the subject must be war, terrorism, political crisis or any of those as heavy backdrop.Not here.  The power of 'Broken Wings' is that it is the story of the universally shattered family, trying to regroup after the sudden, very unexpected death of the family patriarch in the most banal of ways.  You soon see that - based on the way the everyone seems to be spinning out - this man was not simply the father, but the touchstone of the family.  Now, the events in 'Wings' beg the question: will the center hold?  The actors are Israeli, the movie set in Haifa, but this just as easily could be Manchester, Moscow, Chicago, Toronto, etc.  These are themes that anyone can identify with.Let's hope future movie makers have the good sense to seek out Maya Maron (as daughter Maya) like Bergman did.

824799,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B000255L98,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[3, 4]","It has been nine months since the death of the father of the Israeli Ulman family.  His sudden death has caused the family, based in Haifa, to undergo chaos.  The mother Dafna is a midwife who has a hectic schedule and being so tired at the end of her shift, has no time to supervise the children, save by phone during her shift.Maya is an aspiring singer-songwriter who is juggling her dreams along with looking after her siblings and going to school.  She has written a song, ""Cartoon Dream"" dedicated to and about her late father.  She has become a bit cynical.  When she is asked what her mother does for a living, she answers-""the oldest profession.""  She then adds to the shocked teacher's reaction, ""A midwife.  What answer were you expecting?""  However, one of the bandmembers, Yoram, is frustrated of the absences that cause her to miss a crucial band competition.  He is serious about making it big and getting a record contract.Mr. Ulman's death has also affected Yair, the oldest boy and also a teenager, who has dropped out of school and has taken to distributing flyers wearing a mouse costume, providing the comical highlight of the film.  This is his way of philosophically proving that human beings are nothing but specks of dust and that everything is meaningless in the larger context of time and space.  After all, what's the difference between flyers and diplomas?  Both are papers.  And yes, there is the clich&eacute;, though not belaboured, of being a man or a mouse.  Yair's costume symbolizes his withdrawal, his refusal to join the world.Yair's withdrawal has also affected Iris, a girl on the basketball team who blames him for abandoning the team, on which he was quite a player, and for breaking off contact with her.  He uses a three-pointer jump shot as a metaphor for life.  Once that three-pointer leaves your hands, the ball is dead.As for the two younger children, six-year old Bahr wets her bed and frets at her mother's inability to take her to kindergarten.  and eleven-year old Ido becomes obsessed in taking video camera pictures of himself jumping from the top of an empty swimming pool.It takes a life-threatening accident to one of the siblings for the others to pull themselves out of their respective ruts, heal themselves, and thus become aware of their potential.  If we do have it, it certainly doesn't bear putting it in Yair's context.  True, we have a definite timeline, and during that time, one should try to strive to achieve it.  The family's state of mind is also reflected in their family's rundown car, which often requires a running push.  When it works, great, otherwise,...oh dear!  The other ironic thing is the time since the death of Mr. Ulman.  Nine months is the average time it takes for a baby to be born.  As the story opens, Ulman's death looms heavily to the viewer, yet at the denouement, nine months proves to be yet another rebirth.At times, Maya Maron (Maya) resembles P.J. Harvey, other times, Laura Nyro, but she is very credible, strong, exuding anger, frustration, sadness, and someone struggling to pull herself together.  Nitai Gaviratz as the calm, philosophical, and lackadaisical Yair also succeeds, but so does Orly Silbersatz Banai as the ever-tired Dafna, who finally wakes up in order to pull the family together in the wake of the accident.A winning and honest film, whose title reminds me of the song by Mr. Mister-""take these broken wings, and learn to fly again and live your life so free.""

The various emotional aspects keep audiences watching closely, including Ido's head injury that leaves him comotose, Maya's struggle to communicate with her family beyond her big music break, Yair's dissatisfaction in life that leaves him with an unlikable job and a disadmiration to live, and Dafna's confrontation of her past trials. The building climax leads to an unforgettable conclusion that will leave audiences breathless.This brilliant plot, written in hebrew text, never loses its emotional aspect for a moment.

The multiple storylines blend together wonderfully. The talented actors express their individual characters' hardtimes beautifully, adding to the powerful theme.

824803,A3TXY9E0HDWMXK,B000255L98,Howard Schumann,"[13, 13]","The trauma that accompanies the sudden loss of a beloved family member is being repeated all over the Middle East today. Behind the headlines are the stories we never read about. One of these is told metaphorically in Nir Bergman's brilliant first effort Broken Wings. It is not an overtly political film, but the implications are clear. Set in the Israeli port city of Haifa, it depicts the effect of the loss of a patriarch on each member of his family, perhaps suggesting the emotional state of Israel since the murder of Yitzhak Rabin. The 83-minute film won accolades at the Berlin International Film Festival and has been a huge critical and commercial success in Israel, winning nine Israeli Academy Awards in 2003.The beautifully expressive Maya Maron, in her first major role, plays an Israeli teenage singer-songwriter (also named Maya) who dreams of becoming a rock star, and wears wings when she sings in her local band. As the film opens, Maya is singing a song she wrote in memory of her father who died suddenly nine months earlier, for reasons not disclosed until the end of the film. Her song is interrupted when her mother Dafna (stage actress Orly Zilberschatz Banai), a nurse, phones and tells her that she has been called to work on the night shift at the local hospital and needs Maya home to take care of her brother Ido and sister Bahr. Maya emphatically refuses, then relents, but the tension between mother and daughter is palpable.The young woman, who was with her father when he died, does not fully grasp the guilt behind her bottled-up rage, and takes out her anger on her mother, who is both sympathetic and irritating as she labors wearily to keep the family from a collision course. We learn that each family member is suffering the father's loss in his or her own way. Dafna stayed in bed for three months, leaving the children to do the parenting, and the results are reflected in their erratic behavior. Six-year old Bahr wets her bed and Ido carries out a strange ritual of filming himself while jumping into an empty pool. The oldest brother Yair (Nitai Gaviratz), also a teenager, has been suspended from school, and hands out leaflets on commuter trains dressed in a mouse costume while expressing a nihilistic philosophy to anyone who will listen. His inability to respond to the words father, fear, and anger during a word association test prompts his school counselor to deny him re-admittance until he receives treatment, but he does not help his cause when he tells the counselor &quot;Your words are meaningless. This conversation does not exist and you don't exist.&quot;Yair tells Maya that &quot;things could be worse,&quot; and they do get worse before they get better.

Burns,"[7, 8]","Two of the best foreign films I've seen this year (Waiting For Happiness, I'm Not Scared) have slipped under the critical and commercial radar and been seen by far too few people. After seeing director Nir Bergman's strikingly honest, refreshingly unpretentious Broken Wings, I'm ready to make that three. Wings doesn't have a very original story - a family, consisting of a mother and her four children, must cope with the sudden loss of their father - but what the movie does with that basis is what makes the film remarkable.Not one time, for the first 45 minutes of this 82 minute film, are words even similar to &quot;My dad died&quot; even mentioned. We just see mother Dafna and kids Maya, Yair, Ido, and Bahr simply living their simple lives and doing their best to displace their sorrow. Wings never dives into pretentious artfulness or even melodrama when another tragic occurrence rocks the family, it is so grounded in its aim and execution. And I was deeply struck by the dialogue as well; the characters speak and deal with situations of the present, not woefully lingering on the past. I was reminded of The Station Agent, watching this movie. Both films have deeply sorrowful undercurrents to their narratives, yet each has the control and precision to do what people would do, not characters in a movie about living after tragedy. The title Broken Wings is a metaphor in itself, but like the movie itself, it's not heavy-handed in the least.

So maybe it was the mood I was in, or maybe it's my taste in films.This Israeli film (won the Israeli equivalent of the Oscar, as I understand it, so it has something to do with the way Israelis understand themselves, I think) tells the story of a family of 5 struggling to live without the father, who died unexpectedly.  The mother is clinically depressed, as nearly as I could tell, and wants to sleep all the time.  She works as a midwife, which means working shifts, and a lot of the childcare responsibility falls on the oldest daughter, because the oldest son is no help at all.  This daughter is not happy about not being able to have her own life and resents the situation she's in.  The youngest two children are not getting enough of their mother's time and attention, who is too busy working and/or depressed (sleeps when she gets home) to give them what they need.  Money is tight.  The car has trouble starting.It's just so grim.  It's supposed to be a hopeful film, but if that's hopeful, I'm glad I'm not living in Israel.  I had to agree with reviewers who commented on how apolitical it is -- this could have been filmed in Europe.  There are no Palestinians, no soldiers, no bombs, and no politics.  It's very odd, in my opinion.But what kept me from liking this film very much is that it is just too grim. Just looking at the mother's face made me depressed. Way too little happiness.

824813,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000255L98,Roland E. Zwick,"[9, 10]","""Broken Wings"" is a poignant, slice-of-life drama about an Israeli family's coming to terms with the death of their father nine months earlier.  The widow, Dafna, is a 43 year-old mother of four who works endless hours as a midwife at the local hospital, both to earn money to support her family as well as to avoid having to face the reality of the tragic loss she has suffered.  For while she is a loving, devoted mother, she seems unable to provide the guidance and solace her children need in this time of incomprehensible grief and suffering.  Thus, the children are left to cope more or less on their own as best they can - and this on top of all the problems young people face just doing the ordinary, day-to-day  business of growing up.  Her oldest son, Yair, has responded to his father's death by dropping out of high school and adopting a fatalistic philosophy, declaring that life is nothing more than a series of random events that mean nothing against the backdrop of an immensely vast, impersonal universe.  The oldest daughter, 17 year-old Maya, has hopes of becoming a successful rock musician, but finds herself having to carry the burden of raising the two younger children while their absent mother spends most of her waking hours at work.  The two youngsters, Ido and Bahr, cope with the loss of their father and the inadvertent neglect from their overworked mother in various and heartbreaking ways.  The narrative is paced in such as way that we learn about the life of this family only through bits and pieces of carefully revealed information, with each scene exposing more and more about the people and their situation until ultimately a full picture emerges.  In fact, it is a good half hour at least before we even know that the father is dead.The movie takes a very low-keyed approach to its subject matter, showing, in an understated fashion, the devastating effect the death of a parent can have on a family unit.  The film is filled with lovely little moments of humor, warmth and insight that draw us deeply into the drama.  We see how each of the various characters responds to the situation and to each other, watching as the feelings of guilt, resentment and recrimination bubble to the surface.  As a second crisis hits the family, a whole host of long-dormant feelings and emotions finally break out in open conflict.  Yet, as with a wound that needs to be cauterized before it can heal, this second trauma proves to be the rupture the family needs to begin its process of recovery.  The amazing thing is that writer/director Nir Bergman is able to do all this in an economical 82-minute running time.  Yet, even with that limited length, the filmmaker captures the texture of the family members' daily lives through an impressive array of sharply drawn subsidiary characters who play an integral part in the central drama.Bergman has also been blessed with first-rate actors in the primary roles.  Orly Silbersatz Banai as Dafna, Maya Maron as Maya, and Nitai Gaviratz as Yair deliver, beautifully realistic, heartfelt performances.  The other cast members are all excellent as well.""Broken Wings"" is a small, overlooked gem that gets to the heart of what it means to be a family.

Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[36, 37]","Nine short months after the sudden death of the father the Ulman family psychologically resides in the deep crevices of pain, sorrow and mourning. Juggling her job as a midwife and taking care of her four children Dafna has barely enough time or opportunity to grieve. Each child is also struggling in their own manner with their father's death that has threatened to break apart the bonds of their family.This film is beautiful and realistic in the manner of how each character's pain is portrayed. Even though they reside under the same roof each is dealing with their own sphere of remorse. I was greatly moved by the grief that they endured. The father's death itself is rarely mentioned and the exact details of the tragedy are not revealed until towards the end.Although this film is set in the port city of Haifa, Israel there were no mention of politics, which was quite strange since it seems that everything I hear or see concerning Israel is associated with world political affairs. For this reason alone I found this film to be refreshing as it showed the lives of &quot;normal&quot; Israelis away from the newspaper headlines.

The story of a family 's struggling to go on after the father has been killed gives a close- up look at Israeli 'shechunah' neighborhood life. The characters are believable and likeable even as they struggle in their odd ways to survive. The caretaking sister, and the dreaming weak brother who does risky things just to prove himself, are placed in  a very realistic setting and background.

They're as flawed as their characters, as confused and often contradictory. But that's why this is so good. It really does feel like you're watching real people stumblingly try to deal with suffering and loss. Not a light film, but it is ultimately uplifting. And I appreciated that the filmaker respects the intelligence of the audience. This isn't a film that holds your hand and tells you exactly what to think. It requires that you be a grown up viewer - or a realistic adolescent dealing with issues of family, relationship, angst and sex. It's also nice to have a glimpse into Israeli life that has nothing to do with politics.",4,"Strong, realistic film, not in the Hollywood mode",1118102400,"06 7, 2005",2005,781,"['Very', 'good', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', 'entirely', 'Hollywood', 'flavored', 'films', 'actors', 'look', 'seem', 'real', 'people', ""'re"", 'as', 'flawed', 'characters', 'confused', 'often', 'contradictory', 'why', 'so', 'good', 'really', 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'real', 'people', 'stumblingly', 'try', 'deal', 'suffering', 'loss', 'Not', 'light', 'film', 'ultimately', 'uplifting', 'appreciated', 'filmaker', 'intelligence', 'audience', ""n't"", 'film', 'hand', 'tells', 'exactly', 'what', 'think', 'be', 'grown', 'up', 'viewer', 'realistic', 'adolescent', 'dealing', 'issues', 'family', 'relationship', 'angst', 'sex', 'also', 'nice', 'have', 'glimpse', 'Israeli', 'life', 'nothing', 'do', 'politics']",N/A
