There is the usual seven stories on here and three activites and a music video. It's funny have the story on here entitled Fish has the exact same name as the story from season 4 called Fish. The stories on this dvd are:THOMAS SAVES THE DAY 8/10:Thomas isn't very good at turning the sharp bend around the mountain so he has Annie and Clarabel guide him. But on day, he doesn't have his two coaches with him and ends up crashing on the sharp turn. The next day, Thomas must stop some runaway trucks but can he make it pass the mountain bend?DON'T TELL THOMAS 8/10:There is a surprise that everyone on the island is planning for Thomas and Thomas gets suspicious when he hears the other engines talking about it. He soon gets mad when nobody will tell him about the surprise. At last the surprise is ready but Thomas is nowhere to be seen.FISH 7/10:Thomas is to take a load of fish to the harbor. Since he hates the smell of fish, he decides to take all the cars of fish at once and pulls his train very fast, but the troublesome trucks are up to no good again.HALLOWEEN 9/10:Thomas and Emily are sent to the old engine shed on halloween night but they are very afraid that the ghost engine will get them. When they get there, Arry and Bert hide in the shadows and play tricks on them, leading Thomas and Emily to believe that there really is a ghost engine after them.SPIC AND SPAN 9.5/10:A railway inspector is coming to the Island of Sodor to make sure that all the engines are clean and in working order. The bigger engines are sure that they will be the best but Thomas and Percy are determined too.Chickens to School 10/10:Thomas has a very big job to do. He has to pick up the children and take them to school, take chickens to the market, and sheep to the farm. While doing the job, Thomas gets tired and messes everything up.THOMAS AND THE CIRCUS 9/10:The circus is coming to the island and all the engines are very excited. Thomas gets to collect the circus from the docks. The train is very heavy and Thomas has to work extra hard but when other engines offer to help, Thomas refuses to share the fun.Again, good selection of stories. I am unsure of when the nineth season will start but it should start at the beginning of next year.",4,Best season 8 compilation so far,1124150400,"08 16, 2005",2005,2326,"['Thomas', 'video', 'was', 'too', 'bad', 'stories', 'are', 'good', 'season', '8', 'grown', 'usual', 'seven', 'stories', 'here', 'three', 'activites', 'music', 'video', 'funny', 'have', 'story', 'here', 'entitled', 'Fish', 'exact', 'same', 'name', 'story', 'season', '4', 'called', 'Fish', 'stories', 'dvd', 'are', 'THOMAS', 'SAVES', 'THE', 'DAY', '8/10', 'Thomas', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'turning', 'sharp', 'bend', 'mountain', 'so', 'Annie', 'Clarabel', 'guide', 'day', ""n't"", 'have', 'two', 'coaches', 'up', 'crashing', 'sharp', 'turn', 'next', 'day', 'Thomas', 'must', 'stop', 'runaway', 'trucks', 'can', 'make', 'pass', 'mountain', 'bend', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'TELL', 'THOMAS', '8/10', 'surprise', 'everyone', 'island', 'planning', 'Thomas', 'Thomas', 'suspicious', 'when', 'other', 'engines', 'talking', 'soon', 'mad', 'when', 'nobody', 'will', 'tell', 'surprise', 'last', 'surprise', 'ready', 'Thomas', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen.FISH', '7/10', 'Thomas', 'take', 'load', 'fish', 'harbor', 'smell', 'fish', 'take', 'cars', 'fish', 'once', 'pulls', 'train', 'very', 'fast', 'troublesome', 'trucks', 'are', 'up', 'good', 'again.HALLOWEEN', '9/10', 'Thomas', 'Emily', 'are', 'sent', 'old', 'engine', 'shed', 'halloween', 'night', 'are', 'very', 'afraid', 'ghost', 'engine', 'will', 'get', 'When', 'get', 'there', 'Arry', 'Bert', 'hide', 'shadows', 'play', 'tricks', 'leading', 'Thomas', 'Emily', 'believe', 'really', 'ghost', 'engine', 'them.SPIC', 'AND', 'SPAN', '9.5/10', 'railway', 'inspector', 'coming', 'Island', 'Sodor', 'make', 'sure', 'engines', 'are', 'clean', 'working', 'order', 'bigger', 'engines', 'are', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'Thomas', 'Percy', 'are', 'determined', 'too.Chickens', 'School', '10/10', 'Thomas', 'very', 'big', 'job', 'do', 'pick', 'up', 'children', 'take', 'school', 'take', 'chickens', 'market', 'sheep', 'farm', 'doing', 'job', 'Thomas', 'tired', 'messes', 'everything', 'up.THOMAS', 'THE', 'CIRCUS', '9/10', 'circus', 'coming', 'island', 'engines', 'are', 'very', 'excited', 'Thomas', 'collect', 'circus', 'docks', 'train', 'very', 'heavy', 'Thomas', 'work', 'extra', 'hard', 'when', 'other', 'engines', 'offer', 'help', 'Thomas', 'share', 'fun.Again', 'good', 'selection', 'stories', 'am', 'unsure', 'when', 'nineth', 'season', 'will', 'start', 'should', 'start', 'beginning', 'next', 'year']",N/A
