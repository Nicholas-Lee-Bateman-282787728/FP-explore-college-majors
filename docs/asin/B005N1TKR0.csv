We get to watch as five dumb, yet attractive, young men fight it out to become this years Go Go Champion. At the beginning, I was afraid that this was going to be a clunker. It starts off kind of dull. But then when the contest begins, it's a riot until almost the end. Hedda Lettuce is responsible for the movie being so much fun. She is hilarious every time she is on screen. And the judges get a lot of laughs as well. Actually, it's when the go-go boys are onscreen that the film is at its weakest. Sure, they look good, especially with their shirts off. But they just didn't get many laughs from me. It's Hedda Lettuce that makes Go Go Crazy worth tracking down for fans of campy gay films.",4,"I'm ""Go Go Crazy"" For Hedda Lettuce",1323648000,"12 12, 2011",2011,748,"['Go', 'Go', 'Crazy', 'mockumentary', 'go-go', 'contest', 'get', 'watch', 'five', 'dumb', 'yet', 'attractive', 'young', 'men', 'fight', 'out', 'become', 'years', 'Go', 'Go', 'Champion', 'beginning', 'was', 'afraid', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'clunker', 'kind', 'dull', 'then', 'when', 'contest', 'riot', 'almost', 'end', 'Hedda', 'Lettuce', 'responsible', 'movie', 'being', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'hilarious', 'time', 'screen', 'judges', 'get', 'lot', 'laughs', 'well', 'Actually', 'when', 'go-go', 'boys', 'are', 'onscreen', 'film', 'weakest', 'Sure', 'look', 'good', 'especially', 'shirts', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'many', 'laughs', 'Hedda', 'Lettuce', 'Go', 'Go', 'Crazy', 'tracking', 'down', 'fans', 'campy', 'gay', 'films']",Go Go Crazy
1495039,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B005N1TKR0,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[3, 3]","From the director of ""The Big Gay Musical"" comes another rather unusual gay film, a ""mockumentary"" (pseudo-documentary, meant as a satire) of a ""Go Go Boy"" contest in a Philadelphia gay bar.  Featuring real drag icon Hedda Lettuce, as well as porn star Jake Steele (who plays the previous year's contest winner), the film is essentially an excuse to give screen time to some good-looking, trim early-20-something guys who portray a variety of diverse types of guys (some gay, some straight) who might enter such a contest, for the fame and the $1,000 prize.  Comic relief is provided by the guys themselves, as well as supporting characters including the sleazy bar owner, a bar employee with an unrequited crush on one of the dancers, and an over-the-top Celine Dion impersonator.There's not much substance here, and the concept can get tiresome if you are not in the mood for it.  Likely would have been more fun if it were actually shot in front of an audience (It's obvious the shots of the crowd are just spliced in, and there is no applause or noise during the boys' performances, which is simply not realistic.)  Might be cute to run in the background at a gay party, or to discourage someone who is actually thinking of entering an amateur go-go boy contest.  Besides some eye candy, I thought it had its funny moments, so I give it three stars out of five.  Your mileage may vary.",3,Somewhat amusing satire of what goes on behind the scenes of a Go Go Boy contest.,1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,1389,"['director', 'Big', 'Gay', 'Musical', 'rather', 'unusual', 'gay', 'film', 'mockumentary', 'pseudo-documentary', 'meant', 'satire', 'Go', 'Go', 'Boy', 'contest', 'Philadelphia', 'gay', 'bar', 'Featuring', 'real', 'drag', 'icon', 'Hedda', 'Lettuce', 'as', 'well', 'porn', 'star', 'Jake', 'Steele', 'who', 'previous', 'year', 'contest', 'winner', 'film', 'essentially', 'excuse', 'give', 'screen', 'time', 'good-looking', 'trim', 'early-20-something', 'guys', 'who', 'portray', 'variety', 'diverse', 'types', 'guys', 'gay', 'straight', 'who', 'might', 'enter', 'such', 'contest', 'fame', '1,000', 'prize', 'Comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'guys', 'as', 'well', 'supporting', 'characters', 'including', 'sleazy', 'bar', 'owner', 'bar', 'employee', 'unrequited', 'crush', 'one', 'dancers', 'over-the-top', 'Celine', 'Dion', 'not', 'much', 'substance', 'here', 'concept', 'can', 'get', 'tiresome', 'are', 'not', 'mood', 'Likely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fun', 'were', 'actually', 'shot', 'front', 'audience', 'obvious', 'shots', 'crowd', 'are', 'just', 'spliced', 'applause', 'noise', 'boys', 'performances', 'simply', 'not', 'realistic', 'Might', 'be', 'cute', 'run', 'background', 'gay', 'party', 'discourage', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'thinking', 'entering', 'amateur', 'go-go', 'boy', 'contest', 'eye', 'candy', 'thought', 'had', 'funny', 'moments', 'give', 'three', 'five', 'mileage', 'may', 'vary']",Go Go Crazy

This is particularly true of interviews with go go boy contestants that go too long (and over the top) in playing up their eccentricity. The contestants work too hard at trying to be odd, particularly the ballet dancer who wants to be a stripper. On the plus side, I thought Hedda Lettuce had some pretty funny lines. You can tell she's spent many a night entertaining a live audience.

1495042,A224BKBLXVA859,B005N1TKR0,Rocky Sunico,"[0, 0]","The mockumentary format wasn't a bad idea - it could have had a lot of potential in the long run. But beyond the initial interviews and home visits, it feels like the mockumentary format gets dropped during the competition itself and it's not clear that the cameras are visible to the contestants or not. Some of their efforts to sabotage one another are done with the camera cutting to zoomed-in shots and such, which might have made more sense with a gradual zoom-in instead of quick cuts. They only really remember the mockumentary format at the end when they wrap up the whole romp.The contestants are all pretty bad actors, except maybe for Kiernon (Michael Cusumano) given he was pretty consistent in his portrayal of a foreign male ballet dancer. Plus he was like crazy flexible and had some legitimate ballet moves - I don't know his background all that well so maybe he is a dancer and I just don't know it.I feel bad that Christina Bianco was involved in this production and wasn't able to show more of her range in terms of impersonations. Sure, she did the prerequisite Celine Dion numbers and a touch of Judy Garland, but that was it. Given her fame on the internet these days, we all know how crazy talented she is. To limit her to being a drunk wannabe celebrity figure the whole time was a waste of her talents.I didn't realize there was a porn star involved in the movie until I started writing this review. In other words, I didn't really find anyone hot. But that's just a question of taste - I'm sure the guys have their respective markets.Apart from the steady banter of Hedda Lettuce, there really wasn't all that much comedy in the movie to really make you laugh. It has some quirky moments that try to go full camp but instead it just feels ridiculous. Good camp is never easy to do - and movies like this help prove that fact.",1,Only Watch This For Hedda Lettuce,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,1851,"['mockumentary', 'format', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'idea', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'long', 'run', 'initial', 'interviews', 'home', 'visits', 'mockumentary', 'format', 'dropped', 'competition', 'not', 'clear', 'cameras', 'are', 'visible', 'contestants', 'not', 'efforts', 'sabotage', 'one', 'are', 'done', 'camera', 'cutting', 'zoomed-in', 'shots', 'such', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'gradual', 'zoom-in', 'instead', 'quick', 'cuts', 'only', 'really', 'remember', 'mockumentary', 'format', 'end', 'when', 'wrap', 'up', 'whole', 'romp.The', 'contestants', 'are', 'pretty', 'bad', 'actors', 'maybe', 'Kiernon', 'Michael', 'Cusumano', 'given', 'was', 'pretty', 'consistent', 'portrayal', 'foreign', 'male', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'was', 'crazy', 'flexible', 'had', 'legitimate', 'ballet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'background', 'well', 'so', 'maybe', 'dancer', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'it.I', 'feel', 'bad', 'Christina', 'Bianco', 'was', 'involved', 'production', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'show', 'more', 'range', 'terms', 'impersonations', 'Sure', 'did', 'prerequisite', 'Celine', 'Dion', 'numbers', 'touch', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'was', 'Given', 'fame', 'internet', 'days', 'know', 'how', 'crazy', 'talented', 'limit', 'being', 'drunk', 'wannabe', 'celebrity', 'figure', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'waste', 'talents.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', 'porn', 'star', 'involved', 'movie', 'started', 'writing', 'review', 'other', 'words', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'anyone', 'hot', 'just', 'question', 'taste', ""'m"", 'sure', 'guys', 'have', 'respective', 'markets.Apart', 'steady', 'banter', 'Hedda', 'Lettuce', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'comedy', 'movie', 'really', 'make', 'laugh', 'quirky', 'moments', 'try', 'go', 'full', 'camp', 'instead', 'just', 'feels', 'ridiculous', 'Good', 'camp', 'never', 'easy', 'do', 'movies', 'help', 'prove', 'fact']",Go Go Crazy
