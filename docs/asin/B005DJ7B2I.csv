Raymond,"[10, 11]","I didn't want to do a review of this until I watched the History Channel's outlook on this conflict, and after that, I made me feel that this deserves more attention, in terms of American Documentary's are concerned of this war. Some may not like the 'overwhelming' perspective of the war from Canada, or the majority of the people talking have British accents, but it's vital, considering the first two years of the war was fought in the west (at that time it was the west) and Canada (British North America). Some people may lead you to believe that this war was won on the spirit of America's prevail at Baltimore, and after New Orleans. They don't even talk about how the Native Americans were affected by this war, as they really were the true losers. This war gives you a pretty good perspective of how the war truthfully was fought. Those who get offended by the American's portrayal of constant losses are letting their patroitism impact their judgements on the war, and don't consider how the war is usually portayed as some sort of Second War of Independence, when Expansion, Trade, and Impressment were much more significant factors. The U.S.'s early blunders, and the impacts of the Native Americans (Tecumsuh as well) on the early part of the war are mentioned, as well. It also talks of Baltimore and New Orleans in a more objective way compared to that of THC (The History Channel). My only regret that isn't quite long enough, but that's a minor complaint.This video is here to portray a much wider perspectives that most we Americans have on this war don't have, for whatever reason(s) that may be.

As a history buff, living here in distant Australia, I knew about the 1812 War and about the Battle of New Orleans as well as the burning down of the White House.  I did not know about the American attempted invasions of Canada nor about the British intention to facilitate the creation of a confederated Native American buffer state.  The British also freed thousands of slaves and many of these joined the British/Canadian forces.Had the British won that war, which the Americans started due to British naval blockades during the Napoleonic War, I think the history of the Americas and, indeed, the world as we know it would be very different.I was thoroughly absorbed by the story and how it was told through expert commentary from American, Canadian, African American, British and Native American historians.  I also enjoyed the battle scene re-actments, the diaries of participants and the animations.

1455730,A26MQ4YGVS5CC2,B005DJ7B2I,Todd Bartholomew,"[5, 5]","The bicentennial of the War of 1812 seems a fitting time to release a nicely balanced documentary covering the war in summary.  At two hours running time it's about the right length for use in classrooms or to learn more about an often confusing and forgotten war.  From experience I know that history teachers dread the War of 1812 as there were many reasons for it occurring, there were many parties involved in the fighting, the fighting was often inconclusive and not decisive, and the result at it's end was pretty much status quo ante bellum.  Perspectives on the war differ greatly amongst the participants as well.  Britons largely have no idea it occurred, focusing more on the larger Napoleonic conflict in Europe.  Americans know of it but not much else.  For Canadians it was the genesis of forming their national identity.  For Native Americans it was desertion by their British allies and the beginning of their decline in fortunes.What particularly struck me was the inclusiveness of documentary as it included a diversity of voices from Canada, Britain, the United States, and Native Americans.  I was particularly delighted to see A. J. Languuth, one of my favorite authors, included along with other respected scholars which tells me that the research that went into this documentary was quite solid.  All too often documentaries on the subject tend to be a little too American-centric which is not only odd but depressing since much of the war took place on the Canadian front.  Touchy subjects like the burning of York (today's Toronto) are included as are the British allowing escaped slaves to take up arms against America; a topic that isn't well known to most people.  The reasons for the war are laid out quite well in an easy to grasp manner as is the odd give-and-take of the fighting along the Canadian border.  Interwoven are fascinating tales of the involvement of Native Americans on the side of the British, the inadequacy and unpreparedness of America to go to war, and how the war bankrupted America causing it to default on its debts.  The Hartford Convention effort is also addressed and that in particular was quite fascinating as it showed the fissures developing in American society that ultimately led to the Civil War were a long time coming and hardly unexpected.Some aspects were certainly downplayed which was a bit disappointing, in particularly the campaign against the Creeks in Alabama and the earlier Patriot War in Florida. Most of the Native American commentators are from clans around the Great Lakes and the focus on that aspect of the war tends to be on those clans with no attention paid to the Creek or Cherokees.  The whole conflict in what was then the southwestern part of the United States is pretty much overlooked, which is a bit distressing as the United States was finally able to open up Alabama and Mississippi for settlement which meant the expansion of slavery and setting the stage for the Civil War.  The Patriot War of 1811 and the subsequent first Seminole War following the War of 1812 also chipped away at Britain's desire to hang on to Florida; in fact Britain's possession of Florida seems to be completely glossed over in this documentary for reasons unknown (they held it until 1819).  Yet overall the documentary presents things in an evenhanded manner, even the more horrific aspects of the war such as attacks on civilian population, and the very brutal scorched-earth nature that the prosecution of the war often took.  Overall ""The War of 1812"" is a very sophisticated, well balanced production that helps round out a basic understanding of the war on a most momentous anniversary.",4,A great balanced summary of a confusing and overlooked war,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,3664,"['bicentennial', 'War', '1812', 'fitting', 'time', 'release', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'documentary', 'covering', 'war', 'summary', 'two', 'hours', 'running', 'time', 'right', 'length', 'use', 'classrooms', 'learn', 'more', 'often', 'confusing', 'forgotten', 'war', 'experience', 'know', 'history', 'teachers', 'dread', 'War', '1812', 'were', 'many', 'reasons', 'occurring', 'were', 'many', 'parties', 'involved', 'fighting', 'fighting', 'was', 'often', 'inconclusive', 'not', 'decisive', 'result', 'end', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'status', 'quo', 'ante', 'bellum', 'Perspectives', 'war', 'differ', 'greatly', 'participants', 'well', 'Britons', 'largely', 'have', 'idea', 'occurred', 'focusing', 'more', 'larger', 'Napoleonic', 'conflict', 'Europe', 'Americans', 'know', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Canadians', 'was', 'genesis', 'forming', 'national', 'identity', 'Native', 'Americans', 'was', 'desertion', 'British', 'allies', 'beginning', 'decline', 'fortunes.What', 'particularly', 'struck', 'was', 'inclusiveness', 'documentary', 'included', 'diversity', 'voices', 'Canada', 'Britain', 'United', 'States', 'Native', 'Americans', 'was', 'particularly', 'delighted', 'see', 'A.', 'J.', 'Languuth', 'one', 'favorite', 'authors', 'included', 'along', 'other', 'respected', 'scholars', 'tells', 'research', 'went', 'documentary', 'was', 'quite', 'solid', 'too', 'often', 'subject', 'tend', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'American-centric', 'not', 'only', 'odd', 'depressing', 'much', 'war', 'took', 'place', 'Canadian', 'front', 'Touchy', 'subjects', 'burning', 'York', 'today', 'Toronto', 'are', 'included', 'are', 'British', 'allowing', 'escaped', 'slaves', 'take', 'up', 'arms', 'America', 'topic', ""n't"", 'well', 'known', 'most', 'people', 'reasons', 'war', 'are', 'laid', 'quite', 'well', 'easy', 'grasp', 'manner', 'odd', 'give-and-take', 'fighting', 'Canadian', 'border', 'Interwoven', 'are', 'fascinating', 'tales', 'involvement', 'Native', 'Americans', 'side', 'British', 'inadequacy', 'unpreparedness', 'America', 'go', 'war', 'how', 'war', 'bankrupted', 'America', 'causing', 'default', 'debts', 'Hartford', 'Convention', 'effort', 'also', 'addressed', 'particular', 'was', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'showed', 'fissures', 'developing', 'American', 'society', 'ultimately', 'led', 'Civil', 'War', 'were', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'hardly', 'unexpected.Some', 'aspects', 'were', 'certainly', 'downplayed', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'particularly', 'campaign', 'Creeks', 'Alabama', 'earlier', 'Patriot', 'War', 'Florida', 'Most', 'Native', 'American', 'commentators', 'are', 'clans', 'Great', 'Lakes', 'focus', 'aspect', 'war', 'be', 'clans', 'attention', 'paid', 'Creek', 'Cherokees', 'whole', 'conflict', 'what', 'was', 'then', 'southwestern', 'part', 'United', 'States', 'pretty', 'much', 'overlooked', 'bit', 'distressing', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'open', 'up', 'Alabama', 'Mississippi', 'settlement', 'meant', 'expansion', 'slavery', 'setting', 'stage', 'Civil', 'War', 'Patriot', 'War', '1811', 'subsequent', 'first', 'Seminole', 'War', 'following', 'War', '1812', 'also', 'chipped', 'away', 'Britain', 'desire', 'hang', 'Florida', 'fact', 'Britain', 'possession', 'Florida', 'be', 'completely', 'glossed', 'over', 'documentary', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'held', '1819', 'overall', 'documentary', 'presents', 'things', 'evenhanded', 'manner', 'even', 'more', 'horrific', 'aspects', 'war', 'such', 'attacks', 'civilian', 'population', 'very', 'brutal', 'scorched-earth', 'nature', 'prosecution', 'war', 'often', 'took', 'Overall', 'War', '1812', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'well', 'balanced', 'production', 'round', 'out', 'basic', 'understanding', 'war', 'most', 'momentous', 'anniversary']",N/A

It does use historians as `talking heads' but their pictured segments are brief enough to not be irritating.One of the historical views that this film covers extensively is the wide-ranging fighting with Canada that occurred and is usually an afterthought in recounting the War of 1812.Every aspect of the war is covered, the war at sea, Britain vs. Napoleon, the burning of Washington and the bombardment of Fort McHenry and the Battle of New Orleans; although these parts of the war could have been more detailed, they are well represented.The conflict with Canada and what Canada remembers as their history and how this really made Canada a nation is all-encompassing in its' scope. The use of the Indian nations and the importance of Tecumseh is well detailed.This was, as this DVD points out, in many instances a war that is forgotten but had wide ranging effects for the North American continent.  The effect on the Native Americans was tremendous. The good, the bad, the mistakes are all brought up. There are many reenactments and some use of period paintings to show the history of this war.All of the legends and stories that one has heard seem to be included; Old Ironsides, Dolly Madison, even the Ballad of New Orleans is related and conveyed to help understand this war.
