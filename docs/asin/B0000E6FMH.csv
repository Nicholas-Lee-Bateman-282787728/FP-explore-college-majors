781456,A14JRNU2JVRBPA,B0000E6FMH,Robert K. Pavlick,"[4, 4]","The film was very well done with great casting. One could easily believe that Mario Lopez really was Greg Louganis; Mario did an excellent job. The photography, with cleverly interwoven footage of the real Olympics, was excellent.The film does not have an astounding plot filled with either mystery, suspense, romance or intrigue, but that's because it is I believe an accurate recording of a real life and real lives never reach the pinnacle of Hollywood standards.But it's an overall good film with some valuable life lessons for young men, straight and gay alike. At this point in time it may be a little ""dated"", but some things never change. Young men today are just as naive and vulnerable as Greg was and just as willing to take dangerous risks which could ruin their futures. Feeling that they are immortal; thinking that they will never get sick and never grow old; thinking that THEY are in control, they make disastrous decisions which impact on the rest of their lives.The film was tastefully done with no ""in your face"" sexuality. It does not promote the gay lifestyle at all but simply exposes how much more difficult it is for gay man to succeed than for a straight man, having to expend a lot of valuable energy simply on covering up and hiding and leading a double life.It's sad that so many talented young people have to stay in the shadows for fear of exposure because society at large does not want anyone to know that a ""gentle-man"" can be strong, courageous and honorable and can equal or exceed the limits of a straight man. Fortunately, Greg Louganis was not one of the hiders and had the courage to ""come out"" and make life just a little easier for others.",4,Some Valuable Life Lessons,1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,1681,"['film', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'great', 'casting', 'One', 'could', 'easily', 'believe', 'Mario', 'Lopez', 'really', 'was', 'Greg', 'Louganis', 'Mario', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'photography', 'cleverly', 'interwoven', 'footage', 'real', 'Olympics', 'was', 'excellent.The', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'astounding', 'plot', 'filled', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'romance', 'intrigue', 'believe', 'accurate', 'recording', 'real', 'life', 'real', 'lives', 'never', 'reach', 'pinnacle', 'Hollywood', 'standards.But', 'overall', 'good', 'film', 'valuable', 'life', 'lessons', 'young', 'men', 'straight', 'gay', 'alike', 'point', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'dated', 'things', 'never', 'change', 'Young', 'men', 'today', 'are', 'just', 'naive', 'vulnerable', 'Greg', 'was', 'just', 'willing', 'take', 'dangerous', 'risks', 'could', 'ruin', 'futures', 'Feeling', 'are', 'immortal', 'thinking', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'sick', 'never', 'grow', 'old', 'thinking', 'THEY', 'are', 'control', 'make', 'disastrous', 'decisions', 'impact', 'rest', 'lives.The', 'film', 'was', 'tastefully', 'done', 'face', 'sexuality', 'not', 'promote', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'simply', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'gay', 'man', 'succeed', 'straight', 'man', 'having', 'expend', 'lot', 'valuable', 'energy', 'simply', 'covering', 'up', 'hiding', 'leading', 'double', 'life.It', 'sad', 'so', 'many', 'talented', 'young', 'people', 'have', 'stay', 'shadows', 'fear', 'exposure', 'society', 'large', 'not', 'want', 'anyone', 'know', 'gentle-man', 'can', 'be', 'strong', 'courageous', 'honorable', 'can', 'equal', 'exceed', 'limits', 'straight', 'man', 'Fortunately', 'Greg', 'Louganis', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'hiders', 'had', 'courage', 'come', 'out', 'make', 'life', 'just', 'little', 'easier', 'others']",N/A
