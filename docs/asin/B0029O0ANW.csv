Its about a 40 something year old high school sports coach with two high school twins who has recently gone through a divorce. His wife hates him and he has been told that the only thing that he is good for is that he is very well endowed. With the help of the most neurotic, incompetent, female ""pimp"" ever, Ray decides to become a male escort. This show is about the escapades that they go through day to day, and you will laugh hysterically during each episode as Ray tries to keep this part of his life private from the people who know him well. The women and characters that he comes across during his part time ""job"", will have you on the floor laughing.

Primarily, I found my attention wandering because the show was meandering.  There are a lot of characters. All of the characters seem uncertain about what they are doing. Because they lack focus and intent, the show lacks focus and intent.  Thomas Jane, he who is ""hung"", sort of decides to become a prostitute to solve his money problems.  He never really seems 100% committed to the proposition though.  It's as if he's dabbling in it. His pimp, the woman poet, has the same problem. His ex-wife is also just a little bit more happily married to her 2nd husband than she was to him but her dedication to that marriage is also hanging by a thread.  Their teen children are also aimless.  It is thus not surprising that the show lacks Oomph and pizazz. Worst of all, I never felt like hiring Jane myself, never the faintest little jingle of charismatic attraction to him. Yes, he's very good looking but a man who wants to attract lot of women typically exudes a lot more than just good looks.I think Jane needs to rev up the charm and allure and shed the soft beta male attitude that is his habitual mien.  His  pimp also has to either be someone else entirely or she has to become focused and intent on promoting him.  She has to step up to the plate, not drift up to it.  The gal muscling in on her territory is a lot more believable as a pimp than she is.The ex-wife and the kids need to be pulled sharply into focus or go entirely out of focus.  Right now they are just blobs on the canvas.Most of all, the writers and overall creator of this show really need to get down to doing some heavy rewriting for season two, if there is to be a season two.  I suspect it is their fault that this show is so unfocused.  There is only so much actors can do when the script doesn't know where it is going.If I compare this to another TV series premiere of the same season also by HBO, EASTBOUND AND DOWN, there is no comparison.  That show nailed what it wanted to be and where it wanted to go right from the very first show. Then the show only grew in power.  Focus never drifted far, if at all, from its main character played by Danny McBride.",3,Shows Promise But Needs More Oomph and Focus,1253232000,"09 18, 2009",2009,2241,"['thought', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'ok', 'think', 'lot', 'fine', 'tuning', 'survive', 'Primarily', 'found', 'attention', 'wandering', 'show', 'was', 'meandering', 'are', 'lot', 'characters', 'characters', 'seem', 'uncertain', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'lack', 'focus', 'intent', 'show', 'focus', 'intent', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'who', 'hung', 'sort', 'decides', 'become', 'prostitute', 'solve', 'money', 'problems', 'never', 'really', '100', '%', 'committed', 'proposition', 'dabbling', 'pimp', 'woman', 'poet', 'same', 'problem', 'ex-wife', 'also', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'happily', 'married', '2nd', 'husband', 'was', 'dedication', 'marriage', 'also', 'hanging', 'thread', 'teen', 'children', 'are', 'also', 'aimless', 'thus', 'not', 'surprising', 'show', 'Oomph', 'pizazz', 'Worst', 'never', 'felt', 'hiring', 'Jane', 'never', 'faintest', 'little', 'jingle', 'charismatic', 'attraction', 'Yes', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'man', 'who', 'attract', 'lot', 'women', 'typically', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'good', 'looks.I', 'think', 'Jane', 'needs', 'rev', 'up', 'charm', 'allure', 'shed', 'soft', 'beta', 'male', 'attitude', 'habitual', 'mien', 'pimp', 'also', 'either', 'be', 'someone', 'else', 'entirely', 'become', 'focused', 'intent', 'promoting', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'not', 'drift', 'up', 'gal', 'muscling', 'territory', 'lot', 'more', 'believable', 'pimp', 'is.The', 'ex-wife', 'kids', 'need', 'be', 'pulled', 'sharply', 'focus', 'go', 'entirely', 'focus', 'Right', 'now', 'are', 'just', 'blobs', 'canvas.Most', 'writers', 'overall', 'creator', 'show', 'really', 'need', 'get', 'down', 'doing', 'heavy', 'rewriting', 'season', 'two', 'be', 'season', 'two', 'suspect', 'fault', 'show', 'so', 'unfocused', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'actors', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'script', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'going.If', 'compare', 'TV', 'series', 'premiere', 'same', 'season', 'also', 'HBO', 'EASTBOUND', 'AND', 'DOWN', 'comparison', 'show', 'nailed', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'where', 'wanted', 'go', 'right', 'very', 'first', 'show', 'Then', 'show', 'only', 'grew', 'power', 'Focus', 'never', 'drifted', 'far', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Danny', 'McBride']",Hung: Season 1

It's always interesting watching someone completely out of there element. I love these types of shows. Hung has quickly become one of my favorites. It has a great cast, good writing, and a story that is pretty easy to follow. This show is also very funny. It's funny even when it's trying to be serious.

Anyone who expects to find ""art"" in a cable television series needs to get their head examined.  Sure, the title and the storyline hinge upon the longstanding myth/reality (depending on which side of the fence you're on) that the better-endowed the man, the better a lover he is...but this is just an excuse for the movie, the ""hook"" if you will.  There are a lot of other layers to this series as well.  As far as mass entertainment goes, there is a refreshingly low percentage of cliches, stereotypes and stock characters...many scenes from ""Hung"" actually do contain a nice bit of originality and authenticity.Excellent camera work and film editing, great music (especially the intro song by The Black Keys, ""I'll Be Your Man""), excellent cast (including a bevy of some FINE FINE babes in various states of undress, especially Alanna Ubach, Natalie Zea and Rebecca Creskoff), and strong dialogue all make this a pleasure to watch.  AND to top off all the eye candy, there's a fair bit of social realism and cultural satire happening too.  Jane Adams, Anne Heche, and of course Thomas Janes do most of the heavy lifting, and there is often a strong ""indie-film"" vibe to many of the scenes.  The viewer is not constantly being challenged to suspend disbelief, in other words.  The viewer does not feel manipulated or patronized or pandered to, which is exceedingly rare in most TV and cinema offerings these days.I borrowed this DVD set from a friend and watched the entire thing on two successive evenings.

People who lead ordinary decent lives are for the most part not terribly interesting as subjects of television dramas and movies.So that's why I decided to give ""Hung"" a chance and while it will not be remembered by me decades from now as the greatest comedy-drama in cable television's history, I've enjoyed the series.I think that's down to the leads of the series, the guy playing everyman Ray Drecker and the actress playing his hapless pimp Tanya make those characters sympathetic and plausible.  And the series manages to inject a fair amount of humor and absurdity in something that in real life is pretty sad and degrading.And besides, all ""Hung"" is is a riff on one on the oldest and most successful tropes in literature...the hooker with a heart of gold...and it still works.So if you don't mind a fair amount of lurid sexual encounters in a show (remember, it's a about a man-whore after all!), I think you will probably find ""Hung"" amusing and sometimes poignant.It's not perfect...sometimes, the Tanya character comes across as such a mess, it's hard to see why her one and only ""ho"" would stay with her. Ann Heche's character (Ray's ex-wife) doesn't come across as terribly sympathetic (it's hard to see why Ray would pine after her).But overall, it's good, escapist trash...and I'll be watching it when the fourth season rolls out.Now, if only HBO would set up an agreement with Tivo so shows like this could be streamed to my TV instead of just to my computer.",4,Another series that I was surprised to find myself liking,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,1983,"[""'ve"", 'recently', 'taken', 'watching', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'shunned', 'past', 'felt', 'were', 'deliberate', 'finger', 'eye', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'approve', 'drug', 'abuse', 'drug', 'dealing', 'prostitution', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'generally', 'described', 'people', 'misbehaving', 'having', 'watched', 'Weeds', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Secret', 'Diary', 'Call', 'Girl', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'now', 'including', 'three', 'seasons', 'Hung', ""'ve"", 'come', 'realize', 'something', 'most', 'part', 'good', 'behavior', 'not', 'cinematic', 'People', 'who', 'lead', 'ordinary', 'decent', 'lives', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'terribly', 'interesting', 'subjects', 'television', 'dramas', 'movies.So', 'why', 'decided', 'give', 'Hung', 'chance', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'remembered', 'decades', 'now', 'greatest', 'comedy-drama', 'cable', 'television', 'history', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'series.I', 'think', 'down', 'leads', 'series', 'guy', 'playing', 'everyman', 'Ray', 'Drecker', 'actress', 'playing', 'hapless', 'pimp', 'Tanya', 'make', 'characters', 'sympathetic', 'plausible', 'series', 'inject', 'fair', 'amount', 'humor', 'absurdity', 'something', 'real', 'life', 'pretty', 'sad', 'degrading.And', 'besides', 'Hung', 'riff', 'one', 'oldest', 'most', 'successful', 'tropes', 'literature', 'hooker', 'heart', 'gold', 'still', 'works.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'fair', 'amount', 'lurid', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'show', 'remember', 'man-whore', 'think', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'Hung', 'amusing', 'sometimes', 'poignant.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'sometimes', 'Tanya', 'character', 'such', 'mess', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'one', 'only', 'ho', 'would', 'stay', 'Ann', 'Heche', 'character', 'Ray', 'ex-wife', ""n't"", 'come', 'terribly', 'sympathetic', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'Ray', 'would', 'pine', '.But', 'overall', 'good', 'escapist', 'trash', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'when', 'fourth', 'season', 'rolls', 'out.Now', 'only', 'HBO', 'would', 'set', 'up', 'agreement', 'Tivo', 'so', 'could', 'be', 'streamed', 'TV', 'instead', 'just', 'computer']",Hung: Season 1

The unstable U.S. economic climate of the late 2000s causes many of the characters anxiety, but this provides further substance to them and the story.The interaction of primary characters such as Ray and his pimp Tanya Skagle (Jane Adams) provides numerous highly entertaining scenes as they both haphazardly learn the trade of heterosexual male prostitution.Despite the plot containing sexual themes, notable story and character development takes place outside of the bedroom, which contributes to a pleasing first series.Nicholas R.W.

In that movie he plays a dancer and a hustler, a role that I am sure helped him in this TV series. In ""Hung"" Jane plays a basketball coach and a history teacher living in suburbian Detroit. Divored and financially strapped, things get even worse for Ray Drecker when his house catches fire and he cannot live there. Desperate for cash Ray delves into the world of escorting with the help of an old flame. The one asset that he possesses that many male escorts don't have is the large size of his penis, which is where the title of the series comes from. ""Hung"" deals with his various encounters with women, many of whom he is not attracted to, but ""meets"" them for sheer financial reasons. Jane does a superb job in playing the lead role and I would have to say he was made for it. He brings humor, intelligence, warmth, and likeliness, all ingredients that are important if you want the audience to like you, especially if your playing a male escort. Anne Heche has a supporting role as Ray's ex-wife in which they share custody of their teenage twin daughters. The first season was a huge ratings hit for HBO and in all ten episodes were filmed. A second season will air in the summer of 2010. Innovative, daring, and addictive are what makes ""Hung"" a must see TV event.
