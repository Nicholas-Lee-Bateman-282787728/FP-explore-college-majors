634175,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00005JNRM,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[26, 28]","Based on Bishop T.J. Jakes' novel and stage play, this is a brutal, honest, and wonderfully acted film on the abuse of young women (statistics: 1 in 3 women have been molested between the ages of 5 and 15). It's a topic not often talked about, fermenting in silence, guilt, and anger, and so often will be continued from one generation to the next. This is what happens in this story, as Cassey, abused by her father, ends up with a boyfriend that rapes her daughter Michelle.This award winning film shows how with the right script and fine acting, one can make a riveting film on a shoestring budget. The story is told in flashback, as Michelle tells Bishop Jakes about her life, both sitting in her jail cell, as she makes a house with no door, out of matchsticks.The cast is superb: Kimberly Elise is Michelle, the central character, Loretta Devine is Michelle's mother Cassey, Debbi Morgan is Twana, Cassey's attractive, youthful mother, Clifton Powell is Reggie, Cassey's boyfriend, and Michael Boatman is Todd, the man who has always loved Michelle. Much of the film is extremely emotional, especially in the sections when the actors talk directly to the camera, a staging concept that is more like a play, but is very effectively used here.The DVD gives the option of widescreen play and full screen, and for this particular film, I prefer the full screen, because so much is captured in the facial close-ups.Bishop T.D. Jakes is one of the great preachers of our time, and is also an author of many books, a playwright, a musician and singer, and the human dynamo that leads the mega-church known as The Potter's House in Dallas, Texas.Well paced direction by Michael Schultz, an almost classical score by Todd Cochran, and some great editing add to the overall excellence of the film.This is so much more than a Christian film, and should be seen by all women, because this tragic problem spans every race and social strata, and in this film you will see your sister, your friend, possibly yourself. It is for those ""countless women whose stories remain untold"", and all those relationships that have been hurt by the silence.Total running time is 94 minutes.",5,"""little girls like me don't grow up, they just die""",1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,2168,"['Based', 'Bishop', 'T.J.', 'Jakes', 'novel', 'stage', 'play', 'brutal', 'honest', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'film', 'abuse', 'young', 'women', 'statistics', '1', '3', 'women', 'have', 'been', 'molested', 'ages', '5', '15', 'topic', 'not', 'often', 'talked', 'fermenting', 'silence', 'guilt', 'anger', 'so', 'often', 'will', 'be', 'continued', 'one', 'generation', 'next', 'what', 'story', 'Cassey', 'abused', 'father', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'daughter', 'Michelle.This', 'award', 'winning', 'film', 'how', 'right', 'script', 'fine', 'acting', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'riveting', 'film', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'Michelle', 'Bishop', 'Jakes', 'life', 'sitting', 'jail', 'cell', 'house', 'door', 'matchsticks.The', 'cast', 'superb', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'Michelle', 'central', 'character', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'Michelle', 'mother', 'Cassey', 'Debbi', 'Morgan', 'Twana', 'Cassey', 'attractive', 'youthful', 'mother', 'Clifton', 'Powell', 'Reggie', 'Cassey', 'boyfriend', 'Michael', 'Boatman', 'Todd', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'loved', 'Michelle', 'Much', 'film', 'extremely', 'emotional', 'especially', 'sections', 'when', 'actors', 'talk', 'directly', 'camera', 'staging', 'concept', 'more', 'play', 'very', 'effectively', 'used', 'here.The', 'DVD', 'option', 'widescreen', 'play', 'full', 'screen', 'particular', 'film', 'prefer', 'full', 'screen', 'so', 'much', 'captured', 'facial', 'close-ups.Bishop', 'T.D', 'Jakes', 'one', 'great', 'preachers', 'time', 'also', 'author', 'many', 'books', 'playwright', 'musician', 'singer', 'human', 'dynamo', 'mega-church', 'known', 'Potter', 'House', 'Dallas', 'Texas.Well', 'paced', 'direction', 'Michael', 'Schultz', 'almost', 'classical', 'score', 'Todd', 'Cochran', 'great', 'editing', 'add', 'overall', 'excellence', 'film.This', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Christian', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'women', 'tragic', 'problem', 'spans', 'race', 'social', 'strata', 'film', 'will', 'see', 'sister', 'friend', 'possibly', 'countless', 'women', 'stories', 'remain', 'untold', 'relationships', 'have', 'been', 'hurt', 'silence.Total', 'running', 'time', '94', 'minutes']",Woman Thou Art Loosed

634177,A1N134HXXST079,B00005JNRM,"Baking Enthusiast ""Liza""","[3, 3]","A gut-wrenching and raw drama, ""Woman, Thou Art Loosed"" is a sobering experience.  This tragic story is told in flashback by a young woman, Michelle Jordan, who's in death row and being counseled by real-life evangelical preacher, Bishop T D Jakes.  As a 12-year-old, Michelle was raped by her mother's live-in boyfriend, Reggie, whom she was obligated to call ""uncle.""  Suffering from the mental and emotional damage, her life spirals downward into drugs and prostitution, landing her in jail.  Paroled after three years, Michelle tries to put her previous life behind her and start fresh--she attends church revival meetings, renews her friendship with Todd, a childhood friend who regards her as his first love, and in an attempt at healing, finally confronts her mother, Cassie, for denying what happened and protecting Reggie all these years.  Just when she's found hope that she could turn her life around, she sees Reggie at a revival, triggering the painful memories and disappointments, and ends it all with violence.The film is an adaptation of Bishop Jake's book and its title refers to one of his several conferences incorporated within his predominantly African-American ministry.  The conference's emphasis is on social ills, and the guidance and empowerment of abused women.  The film has been described as a commercial for the ministry and a vanity production.  I didn't quite see it that way.  Although it was likely intended for the Christian public, and there were taped scenes of the preacher's revival meetings, I viewed it simply as any other film.  My religion had nothing to do with it and had no bearing on my opinions of its quality.  Though he's in it as Michelle's spiritual counsel, this story is not about Bishop Jakes.  It's about the destruction of a little girl and how she later attempts to pick up the pieces of her broken life.  I thought the film to be generally honest and realistic in its portrayal of the long-term damages suffered by the victim, and commendable in its efforts to provide some measure of hope amidst the wreckage.The acting was uneven in many scenes--too melodramatic perhaps where a more subdued or nuanced portrayal would have been more effective.  The lead, Kimberly Elise as Michelle, whose beauty reminded me of a younger Cicely Tyson, was ferocious all throughout, but in some instances could have been tempered by more disciplined direction to better effect.  Loretta Devine as Cassie did a terrific job, surprising me since I don't associate her with dramatic roles.  The use of character monologues, where each would periodically intimate to the camera their thoughts and feelings, was an unnecessary and jarring device.  It's far from a perfect film and there's nothing special that would distinguish it; however, I thought it to be altogether a worthwhile and moving story.",3,An imperfect but honest film,1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,2841,"['gut-wrenching', 'raw', 'drama', 'Woman', 'Thou', 'Art', 'Loosed', 'sobering', 'experience', 'tragic', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'young', 'woman', 'Michelle', 'Jordan', 'who', 'death', 'row', 'being', 'counseled', 'real-life', 'evangelical', 'preacher', 'Bishop', 'T', 'D', 'Jakes', '12-year-old', 'Michelle', 'was', 'raped', 'mother', 'live-in', 'boyfriend', 'Reggie', 'whom', 'was', 'obligated', 'call', 'uncle', 'Suffering', 'mental', 'emotional', 'damage', 'life', 'spirals', 'downward', 'drugs', 'prostitution', 'landing', 'jail', 'Paroled', 'three', 'years', 'Michelle', 'put', 'previous', 'life', 'start', 'fresh', 'church', 'revival', 'meetings', 'friendship', 'Todd', 'childhood', 'friend', 'who', 'first', 'love', 'attempt', 'healing', 'finally', 'mother', 'Cassie', 'denying', 'what', 'happened', 'protecting', 'Reggie', 'years', 'Just', 'when', 'found', 'hope', 'could', 'turn', 'life', 'Reggie', 'revival', 'triggering', 'painful', 'memories', 'disappointments', 'violence.The', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Bishop', 'Jake', 'book', 'title', 'refers', 'one', 'several', 'conferences', 'incorporated', 'predominantly', 'African-American', 'ministry', 'conference', 'emphasis', 'social', 'ills', 'guidance', 'empowerment', 'abused', 'women', 'film', 'been', 'described', 'commercial', 'ministry', 'vanity', 'production', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'see', 'way', 'was', 'likely', 'intended', 'Christian', 'public', 'were', 'taped', 'scenes', 'preacher', 'revival', 'meetings', 'viewed', 'simply', 'other', 'film', 'religion', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'had', 'bearing', 'opinions', 'quality', 'Michelle', 'spiritual', 'counsel', 'story', 'not', 'Bishop', 'Jakes', 'destruction', 'little', 'girl', 'how', 'later', 'attempts', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'broken', 'life', 'thought', 'film', 'be', 'generally', 'honest', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'long-term', 'damages', 'suffered', 'victim', 'commendable', 'efforts', 'provide', 'measure', 'hope', 'wreckage.The', 'acting', 'was', 'uneven', 'many', 'scenes', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'perhaps', 'where', 'more', 'subdued', 'nuanced', 'portrayal', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'lead', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'Michelle', 'beauty', 'reminded', 'younger', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'was', 'ferocious', 'instances', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tempered', 'more', 'disciplined', 'direction', 'better', 'effect', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'Cassie', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'surprising', 'do', ""n't"", 'associate', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'use', 'character', 'monologues', 'where', 'would', 'periodically', 'intimate', 'camera', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'jarring', 'device', 'far', 'perfect', 'film', 'nothing', 'special', 'would', 'distinguish', 'however', 'thought', 'be', 'altogether', 'worthwhile', 'moving', 'story']",Woman Thou Art Loosed

This is the most realistic, yet most hopeful, modern Christian movie I've seen to date.The story starts with a shooting at the altar of a large church.  From there, it follows the deeply troubled past of Michelle, a beautiful young black woman bound by the sins of the past--sins committed by her and against her.  As the tale unfolds, it is impossible to remain emotionally uninvolved.  Her story is representative of many women.  It's one that needs to be heard.From a moviemaking standpoint, ""Woman Thou Art Loosed"" succeeds on a number of levels.  The acting is superb.  The dialogue is poignant and humorous and gritty, while remaining generally unoffensive for a church-going audience.  The occasional documentary style inserts, in which certain characters provide monologues, seemed distracting at first; yet as it went on, these monologues gave us the insight we needed into each character's heartbreaking decisions.  The music, though overblown at a few points, is effective.Perhaps my primary complaint is T.D. Jakes status of near-sainthood here.  We are forced, through the story, to become part of his audience.  On the other hand, his willingness to show the hypocrisy and deceptions within his own congregation are admirable and absolutely realistic.  Some of the scenes might be too much for children, but they are necessary to maintain the story's believability.This movie provides moments of horror, humor, and honesty that are rarely seen or heard in church circles.

634187,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JNRM,Grady Harp,"[67, 69]","WOMAN THOU ART LOOSED is an amazingly successful film. Based on and book and subsequent play by the Dallas Bishop T.D. Jakes (who portrays himself in this film demonstrating quality acting skills), WOMAN is based on a composite of women for whom Jakes has provided counseling in his ministry.  He is committed to the abused women not only of his congregation but now to all abuse women.Michelle (Kimberly Elise is a staggeringly perfect performance) is introduced to us on Death Row with the Bishop TD Jakes making a visit to minister to her. Through a finely wrought series of flashbacks and onscreen commentary by many of the characters in the story we learn that Michelle was raped by Reggie (Clifton Powell), one of her mother Cassey's (Loretta Divine, another praiseworthy performance) boyfriends, transient and live-in, whom Michelle is required to address as 'Uncle'.  When Michelle tries to tell her mother of the rape, Cassey refuses to believe her, fearing that if she confronts Reggie that he will leave her - a woman at whose age and 'family' status makes keeping a man difficult.Michelle escapes her home and takes to the streets with her friend Nicole (Idalis DeLeon) and soon finds herself at eh mercy of a drug dealer Pervis (Sean Blakeman) who requires her to be a stripper and prostitute.  She is eventually imprisoned for various reasons and it is with all of this in the past that the movie opens.Once TD Jakes arranges for Michelle to be out of prison she reconnects with Cassey who is still living with the worthless Reggie, and refuses to take Michelle under her roof.  Michelle finds comfort with Twana (Debbie Morgan) who helps her improve her appearance, sets her up with a fine childhood friend Todd (Michael Boatman) and Michelle attends TD Jakes revivals with the hope of making something  different with her life.  But she is shadowed by her past with Pervis and her loathing for Reggie and ultimately shoots Reggie during one of Jakes' revival meetings.

Jakes had put together a great cast to bring such a moving and powerful story.  Kimberly Elise did a superb job as abuse victim Michelle Jordan whose life went spiraling down a black hole after her ""innocence was stolen,"" and also dealing with trust issues from her standpoint as well as others. Loretta Divine, as the mother, done a great job showing us her emotional struggles between her daughter and her boyfriend. Debbie Morgan showed us how humorous, comforting, and a good adviser she is to her family friends and of course Clifton Powell couldn't be anymore convincing as the snake-in-the grass boyfriend.There are so many lessons taught in this movie as well as learned. The movie not only captured several issues, including sexual abuse, verbal abuse, abandonment, low self-esteem etc. It also demonstrated the negative effects of covering up the issues through lies, misplaced aggression and denial. I liked the way the movie displayed the effect that the revival incident had on each character that was involved. I was also touched by the positive and encouraging words offered by the minister who ultimately had an effect on the main character.Viewers who decide to see or buy this movie must understand that it does not milk-toast the church or sugar coat those who are True Believers, but shows us for what we truly are; real sinners saved continually by real Amazing GRACE. For those who think you have to be Lilly white to be accepted by God, I highly recommend this movie as a big dose of reality. But for those who just see the church as full of hypocrites, you'll come away with an appreciation for how much God loves us imperfect beings and why the Church is full of us!",4,'Woman Thou Art loosed' is a spiritually inspiring film.,1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,1750,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'had', 'moved', 'lot', 'T.D', 'Jakes', 'had', 'put', 'together', 'great', 'cast', 'bring', 'moving', 'powerful', 'story', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'abuse', 'victim', 'Michelle', 'Jordan', 'life', 'went', 'spiraling', 'down', 'black', 'hole', 'innocence', 'was', 'stolen', 'also', 'dealing', 'trust', 'issues', 'standpoint', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'Loretta', 'Divine', 'mother', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'emotional', 'struggles', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'Debbie', 'Morgan', 'showed', 'how', 'humorous', 'comforting', 'good', 'adviser', 'family', 'friends', 'course', 'Clifton', 'Powell', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'anymore', 'convincing', 'snake-in-the', 'grass', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'lessons', 'taught', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'learned', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'captured', 'several', 'issues', 'including', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'abandonment', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'etc', 'also', 'demonstrated', 'negative', 'effects', 'covering', 'up', 'issues', 'lies', 'misplaced', 'aggression', 'denial', 'liked', 'way', 'movie', 'displayed', 'effect', 'revival', 'incident', 'had', 'character', 'was', 'involved', 'was', 'also', 'touched', 'positive', 'encouraging', 'words', 'offered', 'minister', 'who', 'ultimately', 'had', 'effect', 'main', 'character.Viewers', 'who', 'decide', 'see', 'buy', 'movie', 'must', 'understand', 'not', 'milk-toast', 'church', 'sugar', 'coat', 'who', 'are', 'True', 'Believers', 'what', 'truly', 'are', 'real', 'sinners', 'saved', 'continually', 'real', 'Amazing', 'GRACE', 'who', 'think', 'have', 'be', 'Lilly', 'white', 'be', 'accepted', 'God', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'big', 'dose', 'reality', 'who', 'just', 'see', 'church', 'full', 'hypocrites', ""'ll"", 'come', 'away', 'appreciation', 'how', 'much', 'God', 'imperfect', 'beings', 'why', 'Church', 'full']",Woman Thou Art Loosed

I give it 3 stars because due to the language of the movie I know Christians who would not let this movie in their house.  It cursed 5 times.  Possibly 6 times if you count a word that I do not due to the way it was used.  There is also a lot of sexual innuendo, and there is one sex scene which is a little to revealing for a Christian movie.  Also there are quite a few hypocritical Christians in this movie.  With this all said and done though, there is alot of heart ache in this movie which is caused by sins of many different natures.  There is also a realistic repentance from this sin.  All in all, I understand why the directors let this film go in this direction.  Personally, I would have preferred the language to be reigned in a little, and I don't know if T.D.

It is one of those movies that when you finish watching it you don't have to say anything, because you are on the same page with the person who watched it with you. This movie is about a woman on deathrow who requests the presence of a preacher (TD Jakes) and from there she reveals her story. A story of pain, anger, suffering, and freedom. This movie tells one woman's story but it is a story about many many women today. It needs to be told. And I am not going to reveal the storyline because I don't like telling a story. Just know you will be shaken, crying, angry, and pensive through this story.One thing I will say is that you get glimpse of reality so close to home. Even if you're not a survivor- you will walk away feeling that there is something you need to let go. I recommend watching this movie with someone if you are a survivor of abuse because you WILL be triggered. It may call for a counseling session or prayer or the need to hold someone. Because it will speak to your heart and soul. Please see this movie.This movie should ESPECIALLY be seen by men. Married men, single men, gay men...just men period.

I was so impressed with Kimberlys' acting (as always!!) but I really feel like she brought this character to life.  The story was sadly so realistic. I think this movie has been a long time coming, meaning it speaks on subject matter that the african america community is sometimes very hesitant to address.  The effects of such circumstances can really place the indivual on a firey path of self-distance and set them up for failure.  Self-distance may not be present in the dictionary but it is very present in the hearts, minds, and souls of anyone who experiences this films trials in their own life. Once you become accustom to distancing your self from your 'self' meaning hiding your pain, your fears, your emotions, pretending to be ok when you're hurting inside... you create this distance inside of yourself that becomes miles and miles wide within the body. You build up this wall of protection that is so very difficult to break down.  And God forbid the time comes to break it down and you've had it up for so long, that you just can't... and then u miss out, u end up doing the same thing to yourself that your abusers did...

634212,A2W7GQG04QCEVT,B00005JNRM,Wendell,"[5, 6]","There are some real strengths to this movie. First and foremost is Kimberly Elise. She's a very talented and versatile actress, and in this one she plays a damaged convict very well. She's not overly showy with it, not loud and over the top, as some actresses might have been. She just manages to carry within her a hard rock at her heart. Even her body language and subtle facial expressions convey a mixture of danger, longing, humor. Really well done, and quite a departure as Kimberly Elise herself is nothing like the character she's playing. That's real acting.I was skeptical about how I'd feel about Bishop Jakes. This is obviously a full length commericial for him and his ministry. The only thing is he's really quite good. He's a powerful presence on the pulpit and a strong, deep-voiced, wise character in the quieter scenes. So, I know it's a commercial, but why not let him play himself? I don't know who could have done the job better.On the other hand, I'm not that big a fan of Loretta Devine in this. She just plays her role too surface, with rolling eyes and an almost swooning cliche. And this sort of leads into what I didn't enjoy as much about this. In some ways it rehashes old material. African-American literature (and the films based on it) are full of stories of sexually abused women - see Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou, etc. This material was potent when it first came out and gave voice to otherwise voiceless people, but for me at this point it felt a bit dated to have yet another abused African-American child story. This is not to say that it doesn't still happen and that this film will speak to people who haven't read those books, but this viewer wanted a fresher take on it all, some way to take the core material and move it in a different direction. This film goes part way and there are some great performances, but it more fits into a mold than breaks it.",3,"Just less than four stars, actually",1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,1910,"['are', 'real', 'strengths', 'movie', 'First', 'foremost', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'very', 'talented', 'versatile', 'actress', 'one', 'damaged', 'convict', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'overly', 'showy', 'not', 'loud', 'top', 'actresses', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'carry', 'hard', 'rock', 'heart', 'Even', 'body', 'language', 'subtle', 'facial', 'expressions', 'convey', 'mixture', 'danger', 'longing', 'humor', 'Really', 'well', 'done', 'quite', 'departure', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'nothing', 'character', 'playing', 'real', 'acting.I', 'was', 'skeptical', 'how', ""'d"", 'feel', 'Bishop', 'Jakes', 'obviously', 'full', 'length', 'commericial', 'ministry', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'powerful', 'presence', 'pulpit', 'strong', 'deep-voiced', 'wise', 'character', 'quieter', 'scenes', 'So', 'know', 'commercial', 'why', 'not', 'let', 'play', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'job', 'other', 'hand', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'just', 'role', 'too', 'surface', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'almost', 'swooning', 'cliche', 'sort', 'leads', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'ways', 'old', 'material', 'African-American', 'literature', 'films', 'based', 'are', 'full', 'stories', 'sexually', 'abused', 'women', 'see', 'Alice', 'Walker', 'Toni', 'Morrison', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'etc', 'material', 'was', 'potent', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'gave', 'voice', 'otherwise', 'voiceless', 'people', 'point', 'felt', 'bit', 'dated', 'have', 'yet', 'abused', 'African-American', 'child', 'story', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'still', 'happen', 'film', 'will', 'speak', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'viewer', 'wanted', 'fresher', 'take', 'way', 'take', 'core', 'material', 'move', 'different', 'direction', 'film', 'part', 'way', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'more', 'fits', 'mold', 'breaks']",Woman Thou Art Loosed

Her performance here is so powerful that I am rather surprised that she had been overlooked by the Oscar people. Simply put, if you want to compare last year's Oscar winning Charlize Theron's Monster role to another actress, it would have to be Elise. She gets to carry a film on her own for the first time, and it's a very demanding role of a woman abused and raped by her step-fathher, and disbelieved and unloved by her mother. With previous works so impressive such as Beloved and Set It Off, it's the perfect vehicle to let her showcase her most dramatic side.Elise's character(Michelle) is a true representation of the countless abused and victimized woman, despite the fact that this is a fictional story. She had endured a great deal of physical, emotional, and spiritual damage that her life is shattered terribly. To see her victimizer(Clifton Powell) at the ""Revival"" service ceremony, out of impulse, she had to pull the trigger at the ""monster"". It was mesmerzing to see her screaming and in tears as she shot him dead instantly in front of hundreds of people including her mother(Loretta Devine) whom she blamed and hated for years.The story is told in  flashback format when Michelle while on death row was visited by a precher(Bishop TD Jakes). I was impressed the way they shot some of the main characters individually speaking about their thoughts and feelings about the story and their character's experiences directly at the camera. For instance, we get a better understanding why Cassey(the mother) was so neglectful and didn't take her daughter seriously. She talked about her own unfortunate childhood experience with abuse and rape from her father, and the mother just told her to get over it. So to her it wasn't a big deal, it was just a life experience to grow through.This film really dealt with Forgiveness and Redemption, and it's a spiritually impacting journey.",4,"The Bad, The Tramatized, and The Unforgiven.",1111363200,"03 21, 2005",2005,2036,"['Woman', 'Thou', 'Are', 'Loosed', 'very', 'compelling', 'drama', 'featuring', 'amazing', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'who', 'doubt', 'new', 'Angela', 'Bassette', 'decade', 'performance', 'here', 'so', 'powerful', 'am', 'rather', 'surprised', 'had', 'been', 'overlooked', 'Oscar', 'people', 'Simply', 'put', 'want', 'compare', 'last', 'year', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Monster', 'role', 'actress', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Elise', 'carry', 'film', 'own', 'first', 'time', 'very', 'demanding', 'role', 'woman', 'abused', 'raped', 'step-fathher', 'disbelieved', 'unloved', 'mother', 'previous', 'works', 'so', 'impressive', 'such', 'Beloved', 'Set', 'Off', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'let', 'showcase', 'most', 'dramatic', 'side.Elise', 'character', 'Michelle', 'true', 'representation', 'countless', 'abused', 'victimized', 'woman', 'fact', 'fictional', 'story', 'had', 'endured', 'great', 'deal', 'physical', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'damage', 'life', 'shattered', 'terribly', 'see', 'victimizer', 'Clifton', 'Powell', 'Revival', 'service', 'ceremony', 'impulse', 'had', 'pull', 'trigger', 'monster', 'was', 'mesmerzing', 'see', 'screaming', 'tears', 'shot', 'dead', 'instantly', 'front', 'hundreds', 'people', 'including', 'mother', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'whom', 'blamed', 'hated', 'years.The', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'format', 'when', 'Michelle', 'death', 'row', 'was', 'visited', 'precher', 'Bishop', 'TD', 'Jakes', 'was', 'impressed', 'way', 'shot', 'main', 'characters', 'individually', 'speaking', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'story', 'character', 'experiences', 'directly', 'camera', 'instance', 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'why', 'Cassey', 'mother', 'was', 'so', 'neglectful', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'daughter', 'seriously', 'talked', 'own', 'unfortunate', 'childhood', 'experience', 'abuse', 'rape', 'father', 'mother', 'just', 'told', 'get', 'So', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'deal', 'was', 'just', 'life', 'experience', 'grow', 'through.This', 'film', 'really', 'Forgiveness', 'Redemption', 'spiritually', 'impacting', 'journey']",Woman Thou Art Loosed
