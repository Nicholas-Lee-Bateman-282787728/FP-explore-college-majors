Just the Audio.I can't review this Movie because... almost immediately upon starting-up this disc, the Audio was ridiculously out-of-sync.  At first I assumed it was just bad editing in the opening Musical Segment, but afterwards it was obvious that there are serious sync issues here.  So I didn't get a chance to enjoy this Movie at all.I have a PS3 that I play all my Blu-Rays from.  So, this maybe be a PS3 Issue, but I haven't had any other Sync Problems in the last few years.",1,Blu-ray Sync Issues on a PS3,1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,531,"['review', ""n't"", 'concern', 'Movie', 'Quality', 'Just', 'Audio.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'review', 'Movie', 'almost', 'immediately', 'starting-up', 'disc', 'Audio', 'was', 'ridiculously', 'out-of-sync', 'first', 'assumed', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'editing', 'opening', 'Musical', 'Segment', 'afterwards', 'was', 'obvious', 'are', 'serious', 'sync', 'issues', 'here', 'So', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'enjoy', 'Movie', 'all.I', 'have', 'PS3', 'play', 'Blu-Rays', 'So', 'maybe', 'be', 'PS3', 'Issue', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'other', 'Sync', 'Problems', 'last', 'few', 'years']",That's the Way of the World

I read the cover and saw that the album was a soundtrack to a movie.  I wondered why I had never heard of this movie and why nobody I knew ever talked about it.  Now I know why...because it SUCKED!  No, I'm kidding.  It's because it came in and out of theaters so quickly that practically no one saw it.This movie is worth the price of admission if only just to see Charles Stepney in the studio, and actually playing the piano, albeit he only plays a few chords.  The other interesting parts for me were the studio scenes where the session musicians laid down the tracks for that crappy song by The Pages.You could take the plot and dialogue of this movie and apply it to the present day music industry and it will answer your question &#34;Why is music such crap these days?&#34;",5,Look at it as an historical document,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,906,"['remember', 'back', '1976', 'when', 'friend', 'mine', 'brought', 'album', '34', 'Way', 'World', '34', 'house', 'read', 'cover', 'saw', 'album', 'was', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'wondered', 'why', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'why', 'nobody', 'knew', 'ever', 'talked', 'Now', 'know', 'why', 'SUCKED', 'No', ""'m"", 'kidding', 'came', 'theaters', 'so', 'quickly', 'practically', 'one', 'saw', 'it.This', 'movie', 'price', 'admission', 'only', 'just', 'see', 'Charles', 'Stepney', 'studio', 'actually', 'playing', 'piano', 'only', 'few', 'chords', 'other', 'interesting', 'parts', 'were', 'studio', 'scenes', 'where', 'session', 'musicians', 'laid', 'tracks', 'crappy', 'song', 'Pages.You', 'could', 'take', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'apply', 'present', 'day', 'music', 'industry', 'will', 'answer', 'question', '34', 'Why', 'music', 'such', 'crap', 'days', '34']",That's the Way of the World

I think one of the best R&B; groups still around, but lets not get carried away, there will never be a musical entity bigger than the Beatles. They are the center of the musical universe for every artist out there and they will always remain there as the standard of what a music group can accomplish.But I am glad there are a lot of E W & F remastered albums available now.

This is a low budget movie that I personally highly recommend for one reason: There are scenes in it that explain why bad/weak music and barely talented performers become popular: muscle, $, and hype/advertising. Not very many movies address this harsh reality.  Some great books that have documented this in detail are:  ""Stiffed, a true story of MCA, the music business, and the Mafia"" by William Knoedelseder,  ""Hit Men"" by Fredric Dannen,  ""Confessions of a Record Producer"" by Moses Avalon, ""The Real Frank Zappa Book"" by Frank Zappa, and Jimmy Bowen's ""Rough Mix"".  I also liked this movie because it is in a way a gritty ""time capsule"" of the 1970's in the USA / NYC area.  In general, a fun flick, and something a bit unique.",4,"answers the question ""Why is Popular Music today so lame?"",",1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,776,"['reviewer', 'here', 'pointed', 'out', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'personally', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'reason', 'are', 'scenes', 'why', 'bad/weak', 'music', 'barely', 'talented', 'performers', 'become', 'popular', 'muscle', 'hype/advertising', 'Not', 'very', 'many', 'movies', 'address', 'harsh', 'reality', 'great', 'books', 'have', 'documented', 'detail', 'are', 'Stiffed', 'true', 'story', 'MCA', 'music', 'business', 'Mafia', 'William', 'Knoedelseder', 'Hit', 'Men', 'Fredric', 'Dannen', 'Confessions', 'Record', 'Producer', 'Moses', 'Avalon', 'Real', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'Book', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'Jimmy', 'Bowen', 'Rough', 'Mix', 'also', 'liked', 'movie', 'way', 'gritty', 'time', 'capsule', '1970', 'USA', '/', 'NYC', 'area', 'general', 'fun', 'flick', 'something', 'bit', 'unique']",That's the Way of the World

Sig Shore who did ""Superfly"" brings back the Corrupt Captain from Superfly to play the Record Label head who sell this Record Company away. also Freddie from superfly  plays a Minister&also Janitor in this film.  Harvey Keitel plays the SuperStar Producer battling the Label big-wig at pushing the Group as EWF is known as in the Film. this Film in alot of ways was a pre-cursor to Prince's Purple Rain. EWF had the same Management as Prince later had &prince's character in PR was The Kid.  some interesting things they share. but anyay the story line about the music industry is the same then as it is now. talk about irony? I gotta think that yeah this film was done in 1975,but the same rules&overall vibe applies in 2006.  in truth Earth,Wind&Fire hardly have any real roles beyond on stage performance. it was cool to see Maurice White at the start of the film playing the African Instrument the Kalimba. it's a trademark of the EWF Sound. that era of EWF is them at there best.all the Original gang that was the Real FIRRE!! this film didn't do jack for there careeers because only die hard EWF fans remember it. the Album though ""that's the way of the World"" is one of there best. good to hear there instrumental breakdowns&it all coming together.  this as a Film was cheap, poorly edited&under-written. it could have been way better if edited better, better written&also more story to connect. would have been a tight Documentary.
