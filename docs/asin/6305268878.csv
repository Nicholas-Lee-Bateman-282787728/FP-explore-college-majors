The original title for  this film was &quot;The Hairy Bird.&quot; Miramax purchased distribution  rights, changed the name to &quot;Strike!,&quot; failed to advertise it,  and then gave it a very short run in a limited U.S. release before moving  on to other countries. The movie, under the new but equally unhelpful title  &quot;All I wanna do,&quot; was rereleased this year in New York and went  on sale last week as a new DVD.The story follows students combating a  threatened merger with a boy's school. What makes it worthwhile is the  principal cast (Lyn Redgrave, Kirsten Dunst, Rachel Leigh Cook, Gaby  Hoffman), some of the dialogue, and the point of view. Sarah Kernochan  received full support from her team of actresses for a warm heartfelt  comedy about smart independent women keeping control over their own lives.  Insofar as she kept to the conversations between the girls and the  headmistress, it all rang true.  The portrayal of teenage male townies in  the film, however, is excruciatingly bad, and Kernochan made Redgrave's  headmistress too ineffectual for my taste. Excepting these two elements, it  all worked well. &quot;All I wanna do&quot; offers a unique comic take on  women who make their own way in the world and don't take compromise for  granted.",5,A comic hymn to female independence,961113600,"06 16, 2000",2000,1476,"['quot', 'Strike', 'quot', 'wan', 'na', 'do', ']', '1998', 'had', 'hard', 'life', 'good', 'teen', 'comedy', 'girl', 'school', 'perspective', 'fairly', 'sophisticated', 'girls', 'larger', 'audience', 'original', 'title', 'film', 'was', 'quot', 'Hairy', 'Bird.', 'quot', 'Miramax', 'purchased', 'distribution', 'rights', 'changed', 'name', 'quot', 'Strike', 'quot', 'failed', 'advertise', 'then', 'gave', 'very', 'short', 'run', 'limited', 'U.S.', 'release', 'moving', 'other', 'countries', 'movie', 'new', 'equally', 'unhelpful', 'title', 'quot', 'wan', 'na', 'do', 'quot', 'was', 'rereleased', 'year', 'New', 'York', 'went', 'sale', 'last', 'week', 'new', 'DVD.The', 'story', 'students', 'combating', 'threatened', 'merger', 'boy', 'school', 'What', 'principal', 'cast', 'Lyn', 'Redgrave', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Rachel', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'Gaby', 'Hoffman', 'dialogue', 'point', 'view', 'Sarah', 'Kernochan', 'received', 'full', 'support', 'team', 'actresses', 'warm', 'heartfelt', 'comedy', 'smart', 'independent', 'women', 'keeping', 'control', 'own', 'lives', 'Insofar', 'kept', 'conversations', 'girls', 'headmistress', 'rang', 'true', 'portrayal', 'teenage', 'male', 'townies', 'film', 'however', 'excruciatingly', 'bad', 'Kernochan', 'made', 'Redgrave', 'headmistress', 'too', 'ineffectual', 'taste', 'Excepting', 'two', 'elements', 'worked', 'well', 'quot', 'wan', 'na', 'do', 'quot', 'unique', 'comic', 'take', 'women', 'who', 'make', 'own', 'way', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'compromise', 'granted']",All I Wanna Do VHS
457388,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6305268878,Deborah Earle,"[9, 10]","Interestingly, this movie takes place the same year that Betty Friedan wrote ""The Feminine Mystique"".It begins in early 1963 when one Odette Sinclair, played by a rebellious but very charismatic Gaby Hoffman, is taken from her home in Michigan, horse in tow, to the Miss Godard's School for Girls in Connecticut by irate parents after she is caught planning a tryst with her boyfriend, Dennis (a still-slightly boyish Matthew Lawrence).At first, she resents the change of atmosphere. But the solemn, tremulous girl soon finds companionship with a group of girls, who, although they can be antagonistic, encourage her to find other aspirations beyond having sex with her boyfriend. These include her two luminescent blonde roomates, the sexually mature Tinka,whose favorite colors to wear when she's out of uniform are red and black, and the ever-scheming Verena, deftly played by Monica Keena and Kirsten Dunst respectively.Heather Matarazzo's bulimic Tweety is a rather weak-willed character, and Merrit Wever's Momo is strong and smart. Together, these girls form a secret organization called The Daughters of the American Ravioli, in which they pledge to help each other acheive their goals. One of the more immediate ones is to rid the school of their lecherous teacher Mr. Dewey, to whom his portrayer, Robert Bockstael, gives such understated underhandedness. At a time when sex crimes against students at the hands of teachers may have been underreported due to the fact that the teachers most likely would have gotten off, this makes an interesting subplot.But 1963 was the beginning of the modern feminist movement, and these girls take matters into their own hands after the Board of Trustees threatens to merge the school with the St. Ambrose Boys Academy without giving the students any say in the matter. Using every non-violent rescource they have to gain the attention of authority figures, they ultimately help to bail their school out of the financial troubles that led to the decision to merge with the Boys' Academy, and we watch these girls assert themselves and find their voices in a way that might have been more unusual in 1963 than it would be today.Lynn Redgrave leads the cast as the prudish but sympathetic headmistress of Miss Godard's with a very accurate New England accent (Notice how the statue of the school's foundress looks like her).  What struck me about her appearance was mainly her outdated hairdo. The soft-spoken Abby Sawyer, portrayed by Rachel Leigh Cook, is the hall monitor and school legacy who takes a surpising(or perhaps not-so-surprising) turn. Rosemary Dunsmore is Abby's controlling and rather narrow-minded mother who, with her husband, serves on the Board of Trustees. Her role as Mrs. Sawyer is more than faintly reminiscent of her role in ""Anne of Avonlea"" in which she played another staff member at a girls' academy.The party scene was fun to watch. It's interesting, though, how the only minority boy and the only minority boy and girl were paired off, which is how it most likely would have been done in 1963 to avoid complaints from the parents. The music is lively, the rowdy townies come in handy when it comes to putting the girls' tormentors in their place, the dresses and hairdos had a certain elegance and grace, and the cast members were talented and attractive, including the radiant Barbara Radecki and Phobe Lapine as Tinka's mom and sister.Ultimately, this film is a bouncy 90-minute romp through the early modern feminist era which harmlessly pays homage to girl power.I feel upbeat and inspired after watching it!",5,"YOU GO, GIRLS!",1011744000,"01 23, 2002",2002,3590,"['Interestingly', 'movie', 'place', 'same', 'year', 'Betty', 'Friedan', 'wrote', 'Feminine', 'Mystique', '.It', 'early', '1963', 'when', 'one', 'Odette', 'Sinclair', 'played', 'rebellious', 'very', 'charismatic', 'Gaby', 'Hoffman', 'taken', 'home', 'Michigan', 'horse', 'tow', 'Miss', 'Godard', 'School', 'Girls', 'Connecticut', 'irate', 'parents', 'caught', 'planning', 'tryst', 'boyfriend', 'Dennis', 'still-slightly', 'boyish', 'Matthew', 'Lawrence', '.At', 'first', 'change', 'atmosphere', 'solemn', 'tremulous', 'girl', 'soon', 'companionship', 'group', 'girls', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'antagonistic', 'encourage', 'find', 'other', 'aspirations', 'having', 'sex', 'boyfriend', 'include', 'two', 'luminescent', 'blonde', 'roomates', 'sexually', 'mature', 'Tinka', 'favorite', 'colors', 'wear', 'when', 'uniform', 'are', 'red', 'black', 'ever-scheming', 'Verena', 'deftly', 'played', 'Monica', 'Keena', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Matarazzo', 'bulimic', 'Tweety', 'rather', 'weak-willed', 'character', 'Merrit', 'Wever', 'Momo', 'strong', 'smart', 'Together', 'girls', 'form', 'secret', 'organization', 'called', 'Daughters', 'American', 'Ravioli', 'pledge', 'help', 'other', 'acheive', 'goals', 'One', 'more', 'immediate', 'ones', 'rid', 'school', 'lecherous', 'Mr.', 'Dewey', 'whom', 'portrayer', 'Robert', 'Bockstael', 'such', 'understated', 'underhandedness', 'time', 'when', 'sex', 'crimes', 'students', 'hands', 'teachers', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'underreported', 'due', 'fact', 'teachers', 'most', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'off', 'interesting', 'subplot.But', '1963', 'was', 'beginning', 'modern', 'feminist', 'movement', 'girls', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'Board', 'Trustees', 'threatens', 'merge', 'school', 'St.', 'Ambrose', 'Boys', 'Academy', 'giving', 'students', 'say', 'matter', 'Using', 'non-violent', 'rescource', 'have', 'gain', 'attention', 'authority', 'figures', 'ultimately', 'help', 'bail', 'school', 'financial', 'troubles', 'led', 'decision', 'merge', 'Boys', 'Academy', 'watch', 'girls', 'assert', 'find', 'voices', 'way', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'unusual', '1963', 'would', 'be', 'today.Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'cast', 'prudish', 'sympathetic', 'headmistress', 'Miss', 'Godard', 'very', 'accurate', 'New', 'England', 'accent', 'Notice', 'how', 'statue', 'school', 'foundress', 'looks', 'What', 'struck', 'appearance', 'was', 'mainly', 'outdated', 'hairdo', 'soft-spoken', 'Abby', 'Sawyer', 'portrayed', 'Rachel', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'hall', 'monitor', 'school', 'legacy', 'who', 'surpising', 'perhaps', 'not-so-surprising', 'turn', 'Rosemary', 'Dunsmore', 'Abby', 'controlling', 'rather', 'narrow-minded', 'mother', 'who', 'husband', 'Board', 'Trustees', 'role', 'Mrs.', 'Sawyer', 'more', 'faintly', 'reminiscent', 'role', 'Anne', 'Avonlea', 'played', 'staff', 'member', 'girls', 'academy.The', 'party', 'scene', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'interesting', 'though', 'how', 'only', 'minority', 'boy', 'only', 'minority', 'boy', 'girl', 'were', 'paired', 'off', 'how', 'most', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'done', '1963', 'avoid', 'complaints', 'parents', 'music', 'lively', 'rowdy', 'come', 'handy', 'when', 'putting', 'girls', 'tormentors', 'place', 'dresses', 'hairdos', 'had', 'certain', 'elegance', 'grace', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'talented', 'attractive', 'including', 'radiant', 'Barbara', 'Radecki', 'Phobe', 'Lapine', 'Tinka', 'mom', 'sister.Ultimately', 'film', 'bouncy', '90-minute', 'romp', 'early', 'modern', 'feminist', 'era', 'harmlessly', 'homage', 'girl', 'power.I', 'feel', 'upbeat', 'inspired', 'watching']",All I Wanna Do VHS

The story revolves around five girls at an all girls prep school, four of whom have the IQ's of one of Tiger Woods' better rounds of golf.  As usual in  these movies, we are treated to the escapades and mischief cooked up by  bored teens, this time female style.  Unfortunately, most of the skits were  woefully unfunny and stereotyped.As the movie progresses, we learn  that, out of financial need, the school intends to merge with a local boys'  school and go coed.  The girls try to sabotage the plan with a plot at the  next mixer to make the boys look like drunks and perverts.  When that  fails, the film starts taking itself very seriously and the girls organize  a student strike and lock themselves in the dorm demanding the right to  vote against the merger.The direction of this film by writer/director  Sarah Kernochan was uninspiring.  Other than some decent sixties props it  was pretty insipid.  Kernochan made a splash as the co-writer of `9   Weeks' and `Sommersby', but as a solo writer/director she just doesn't cut  it.The acting; well, there really wasn't any acting.  Other than Lynn  Redgrave, who was far too melodramatic for this film, all we had here was a  bunch of pubescent teens behaving sillily.  The only serious teenage  character in the film was Odette (Gaby Hoffman) and she was far too dour  and condescending.This movie is pretty much a disaster.

457394,A1P4RH7KMJ1SV2,6305268878,Molly P.,"[10, 12]","I had been looking forward to this film since August 1998 when I saw a little blurb about it in a teen magazine.  I couldn't wait to see it in theaters.  Unfortunately, it never arrived in theaters here in Portland,  and I didn't get to see it until just recently, on video.  I guess waiting  that long made me have unrealistic expectations for this movie.  I thought  it would be the best movie EVER or something.  It's not . . . but it's  still pretty good.  &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; is the story of a group of  girls at a prep school who try to keep the school from going co-ed.  Heather Matarazzo and Rachel Leigh Cook are both hilarious in this film,  and Kirsten Dunst shines, as usual.  There's some sexual innuendo in here  that probably isn't appropriate for anyone under 13, hence the PG-13  rating.  And the movie is free of action, suspense, or really a lot of  plot.  Still, the film's young actors and actresses save the film and make  it watchable and worthwhile.  Some parts are funny, some will make you  think.

I was just expecting a teen comedy but I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was a strong storyline about the empowerment of women also.The acting was very good from all the cast (the young boys did very good drunk impressions :) ). The costumes and hair were correct for the era (as you can see from the cover). I noticed one error when they were talking about the Beatles (1963 remember).The DVD (in Australia at least) had a good picture and sound. The extras include interviews with the cast and director/writer and a making of. Does the US edition have this? It's not mentioned.
