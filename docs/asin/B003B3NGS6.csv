1335212,A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,B003B3NGS6,DarthJustice,"[6, 8]","No Kidding! Me 2!! is a documentary done by Joe Pantoliano (Ralphie from The Sopranos) on mental illness and the stigma that surrounds it. Joe brings together five other people with mental illness (he himself has clinical depression) to talk about their illnesses and experiences they've had such as dealing with any stigma. Not only that, but the families and friends of the individuals are also involved with discussing their POV of their loved ones mental illness. In addition, several doctors and mental health officials (such as a psychiatry professor) are also talked to and interviewed throughout the documentary. One of the best things is that it's explained at the end in a ""Where are they now"" kind of thing about how life has gone for the participants. Thankfully, most of it is good news to one degree or another.The main mental illnesses the documentary focuses on are clinical depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, ADHD, Bipoar, and paranoid schizophrenia.One such person, Casey, mentions at point how she went to get stitches after a case of self-harm. The doctor found out it was self-inflicted, stitched her up without anesthesia and without saying another word to her. Another discusses his suicide attempt by jumping from his ninth floor window. It's a very frank and opened discussion on the pain people with mental illness suffer through, all too many times alone for far too many people.The people involved are very frank and honest about their illnesses and experiences. Which is great because this was one of Joe Pantoliano's goals and reasons for doing the documentary. He wants to get honest talk and the truth out there on what it's like living with mental illness. The only way to fight the stigma that surrounds mental illness from those who are on ""the outside looking in"".Sprinkled throughout the movie also are a few statistics on mental illness such as 1 in 4 Americans suffer from at least one disorder.One thing I wish they would have done would have a little more variety in what the people had.  I guess what I'm saying is that I just would have liked seeing more lesser known and/or just as stigmatized mental illnesses represented. Say, Borderline Personality Disorder or Social Anxiety Disorder. You know, just ones that are far less ""accepted"" (for lack of a better word) and well known. Or maybe, the ones you never really hear much about but can (and often are) just as debilitating.It's a well done documentary and not just because it's a topic near and dear to my heart. Perhaps you're a person looking to check out some documentaries because you'd like to check out the genre or maybe you're just simply looking for a new one to watch. Or maybe, you fit one of the two above and you want to get a glimpse into what mental illness is REALLY like for those with one or more or their family and friends or perhaps you want to know you aren't alone.Whatever you're reasons might be, No Kidding, Me 2!! is a good choice to pick up. I would suggest it to anyone who is looking for a good documentary to watch.",5,A Frank Discussion And Truth On What It's Like Living With Mental Illness,1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,3055,"['Kidding', '2', 'documentary', 'done', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Ralphie', 'Sopranos', 'mental', 'illness', 'stigma', 'Joe', 'together', 'five', 'other', 'people', 'mental', 'illness', 'clinical', 'depression', 'talk', 'illnesses', 'experiences', ""'ve"", 'had', 'such', 'dealing', 'stigma', 'Not', 'only', 'families', 'friends', 'individuals', 'are', 'also', 'involved', 'discussing', 'POV', 'loved', 'ones', 'mental', 'illness', 'addition', 'several', 'doctors', 'mental', 'health', 'officials', 'such', 'psychiatry', 'professor', 'are', 'also', 'talked', 'interviewed', 'documentary', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'explained', 'end', 'Where', 'are', 'now', 'kind', 'thing', 'how', 'life', 'gone', 'participants', 'Thankfully', 'most', 'good', 'news', 'one', 'degree', 'another.The', 'main', 'mental', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'are', 'clinical', 'depression', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'ADHD', 'Bipoar', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenia.One', 'such', 'person', 'Casey', 'mentions', 'point', 'how', 'went', 'get', 'stitches', 'case', 'self-harm', 'doctor', 'found', 'was', 'self-inflicted', 'stitched', 'up', 'anesthesia', 'saying', 'word', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'jumping', 'ninth', 'floor', 'window', 'very', 'frank', 'opened', 'discussion', 'pain', 'people', 'mental', 'illness', 'suffer', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'alone', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'people.The', 'people', 'involved', 'are', 'very', 'frank', 'honest', 'illnesses', 'experiences', 'Which', 'great', 'was', 'one', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'goals', 'reasons', 'doing', 'documentary', 'get', 'honest', 'talk', 'truth', 'there', 'what', 'living', 'mental', 'illness', 'only', 'way', 'fight', 'stigma', 'mental', 'illness', 'who', 'are', 'outside', 'looking', '.Sprinkled', 'movie', 'also', 'are', 'few', 'statistics', 'mental', 'illness', 'such', '1', '4', 'Americans', 'suffer', 'least', 'one', 'disorder.One', 'thing', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'would', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'variety', 'what', 'people', 'had', 'guess', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', 'just', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'seeing', 'more', 'lesser', 'known', 'and/or', 'just', 'stigmatized', 'mental', 'illnesses', 'represented', 'Say', 'Borderline', 'Personality', 'Disorder', 'Social', 'Anxiety', 'Disorder', 'know', 'just', 'ones', 'are', 'far', 'less', 'accepted', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'well', 'known', 'maybe', 'ones', 'never', 'really', 'hear', 'much', 'can', 'often', 'are', 'just', 'debilitating.It', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'not', 'just', 'topic', 'dear', 'heart', 'Perhaps', ""'re"", 'person', 'looking', 'check', 'out', 'documentaries', ""'d"", 'like', 'check', 'out', 'genre', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'just', 'simply', 'looking', 'new', 'one', 'watch', 'maybe', 'fit', 'one', 'two', 'want', 'get', 'glimpse', 'what', 'mental', 'illness', 'REALLY', 'one', 'more', 'family', 'friends', 'perhaps', 'want', 'know', 'are', ""n't"", 'alone.Whatever', ""'re"", 'reasons', 'might', 'be', 'Kidding', 'Me', '2', 'good', 'choice', 'pick', 'up', 'would', 'suggest', 'anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'good', 'documentary', 'watch']","No Kidding, Me 2!"
