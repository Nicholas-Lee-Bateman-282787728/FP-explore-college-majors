639592,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JOC9,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 2]","Puzzles are fun.  `The Da Vinci Code' provides this fun with a provocative story line that immediately grabs one's interest.  Intrigue is the film's hallmark.  To be brief, we start out with the murder of a professor who is a link to a ""code"" kept secret by Bishop Manuel Aringarosa (A ring around Rosa-!) (Alfred Molina, also ""Doctor Oct,"" `Spiderman II') who is the ecclesial leader of Opus Dei, a secret sect of the Catholic Church.  To cover their crimes, they frame American Professor Langdon (Tom Hanks), who can't help but become a reluctant investigator. He links with Agent Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), the granddaughter of the slain professor.  From the murder's beginning, they are surrounded at the Louvre Museum by the police and the bishop's protege', Silas (Paul Bettany), a cruel and misguided murderer.  It provides for a continuing and suspenseful chase.  The drama unfolds a ""treasure hunt"" as Langdon relates, and we are fed clues to keep our interest going.  Being an expert at historical symbols, Langdon correctly keeps the chase going to crack ""the code"" with Da Vinci leading the way with clever clues.  When stumped we come into the company of Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellan) whose offering is the crux of `The Da Vinci' controversy.  The suspenseful and absorbing chase is interrupted periodically by flashbacks meant to psychoanalyze the key players with backgrounds of faith that are tainted by abuse and misfortune.  (Certainly, the self-immolation of Silas is linked to a faith fostered by abuse.  Or at least he didn't take St. Ignatius's advice that these acts of penance are meant to be a gesture of repentance--not a means of self-torture.)  The resolution is a mixed bag:  It provides answers but is less awe-inspiring than the suspense that precedes it.Appeal will be mixed.  As entertainment, it sustains a mysterious atmosphere and a harrowing chase.  Splitting with the movie has to do with its controversial rendering.  Most people agree that Professor Teabing is the novelist Dan Brown's mouthpiece.  For those who believe the story is historical fiction, they are delighted at the iconoclastic nature of the movie.  For those who believe the story is fanciful fiction are often infuriated with the film.  Sir Teabing says the Catholic Church is an agent of ""oppression and brutality"" and asks, ""What if the greatest story ever told is a lie?""  He refers to the bible.  Tom Hanks, as the modern equivalent of the James Stewart everyman, says ""We've been dragged into a world where people believe it's [the Holy Grail] real?""  The bottom line is ""Believe what you want to believe,"" which is borrowing a line from the Moody Blues who said, ""...And we decide which is right and which is an illusion.""(Let the Christians be offended.  After all, what if the movie was switched and we had the same movie with clues to show that Moses was really gay, or Mohammed frequented brothels?  Could this be passed off as ""fiction,"" fanciful or historical?  The Dutch cartoonists last spring suggest that it could not.)",3,The Puzzler,1163548800,"11 15, 2006",2006,3048,"['Puzzles', 'are', 'fun', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'fun', 'provocative', 'story', 'line', 'immediately', 'grabs', 'one', 'interest', 'Intrigue', 'film', 'hallmark', 'be', 'brief', 'start', 'out', 'murder', 'professor', 'who', 'link', 'code', 'kept', 'secret', 'Bishop', 'Manuel', 'Aringarosa', 'A', 'ring', 'Rosa-', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'also', 'Doctor', 'Oct', 'Spiderman', 'II', 'who', 'ecclesial', 'leader', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'secret', 'sect', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'cover', 'crimes', 'frame', 'American', 'Professor', 'Langdon', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'become', 'reluctant', 'investigator', 'Agent', 'Sophie', 'Neveu', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'granddaughter', 'slain', 'professor', 'murder', 'beginning', 'are', 'surrounded', 'Louvre', 'Museum', 'police', 'bishop', 'protege', 'Silas', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'cruel', 'misguided', 'murderer', 'continuing', 'suspenseful', 'chase', 'drama', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'Langdon', 'are', 'fed', 'clues', 'keep', 'interest', 'going', 'Being', 'expert', 'historical', 'symbols', 'Langdon', 'correctly', 'chase', 'going', 'crack', 'code', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'leading', 'way', 'clever', 'clues', 'When', 'stumped', 'come', 'company', 'Sir', 'Leigh', 'Teabing', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'offering', 'crux', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'controversy', 'suspenseful', 'absorbing', 'chase', 'interrupted', 'periodically', 'flashbacks', 'meant', 'psychoanalyze', 'key', 'players', 'backgrounds', 'faith', 'are', 'tainted', 'abuse', 'misfortune', 'Certainly', 'self-immolation', 'Silas', 'linked', 'faith', 'fostered', 'abuse', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'St.', 'Ignatius', 'advice', 'acts', 'penance', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'gesture', 'repentance', 'not', 'means', 'self-torture', 'resolution', 'mixed', 'bag', 'answers', 'less', 'awe-inspiring', 'suspense', 'it.Appeal', 'will', 'be', 'mixed', 'entertainment', 'mysterious', 'atmosphere', 'harrowing', 'chase', 'Splitting', 'movie', 'do', 'controversial', 'rendering', 'Most', 'people', 'agree', 'Professor', 'Teabing', 'novelist', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'mouthpiece', 'who', 'believe', 'story', 'historical', 'fiction', 'are', 'delighted', 'iconoclastic', 'nature', 'movie', 'who', 'believe', 'story', 'fanciful', 'fiction', 'are', 'often', 'infuriated', 'film', 'Sir', 'Teabing', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'agent', 'oppression', 'brutality', 'What', 'greatest', 'story', 'ever', 'told', 'lie', 'bible', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'modern', 'equivalent', 'James', 'Stewart', 'everyman', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dragged', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'believe', 'Holy', 'Grail', ']', 'real', 'bottom', 'line', 'Believe', 'what', 'want', 'believe', 'borrowing', 'line', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'who', 'said', 'decide', 'right', 'illusion', 'Let', 'Christians', 'be', 'offended', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'switched', 'had', 'same', 'movie', 'clues', 'show', 'Moses', 'was', 'really', 'gay', 'Mohammed', 'frequented', 'brothels', 'Could', 'be', 'passed', 'off', 'fiction', 'fanciful', 'historical', 'Dutch', 'cartoonists', 'last', 'spring', 'suggest', 'could', 'not']",N/A

A visitor goes to Saint-Sulpice. Someone placed a ""tracking dot"" on Langdon.""Who are you?"" Langdon escapes, but is tracked. Or is he? That Fibonacci code was scrambled. An anagram? What is the ""Priory of Sion""? There is a car chase to wake up the viewer. [Are you confused by the plot?] Silas searches for an item. Is it connected to the ""Holy Grail""? [Is this a weird movie so far?]The bishop holds a secret meeting. Elsewhere Sophie talks about family history. There is another strange event, then a man with a gun. Sophie and Robert go to visit Lee, an Englishman who lives in France. Silas learns of their destination. The Priory protects the source of the Church's power on earth - the Holy Grail. [How honest is that history of Constantine?] Interpreting the facts to support a point of view? Can an old painting really tell the facts? Or another example of seeing what you want to see? [No wonder people objected to this movie.] That ""Malleus Maleficarum"" was used for witch-hunting in Renaissance times. The TV news shows Sophie and Robert as murderers on a killing spree.

Fache learns of their air flight plan. A ""Messenger of God""? [Isn't that like saying King Herod was doing God's work?] Elsewhere men talk about destroying a sarcophagus. What about an heir (or heiress)? A sacrifice for the betterment of humanity? Robert finds an engraved metal disk in that wooden box, another clue. They are making history now. Switzerland does not allow extradition. Fache is Opus Dei, his bishop games him orders. Breaking his vow? Will the police intercept them in London? ""Start with him.""

They use a cell phone to trace its calls. Is Sophie the guardian of the grail? ""Open the cryptex!"" There is another surprise before the police arrive. Does Lee's talk sound crazy? They visit an old church. ""Where did she go?"" Men arrive. Sophie tells about her past. Another riddle solved. Is Sophie descended from the Merovingian Kings? Royal blood? [Isn't this all just too fantastic?] Can you believe the ending? Robert gets a clue from a book.

Whether it's at work, with your family, or in relationships, it is the attitude that makes people and their lives totally unimpressive. This is the exact same attitude that turns The Da Vinci Code into an exercise in mediocrity.Let me say that this review is being written as a film geek, and not as a Christian. I was really excited to see this movie. Despite the horrid reviews, I still thought the movie was going to be good because it was being based off of such entertaining source material. While the book was pretty crappy writing, it was definitely a page-turner. Throughout my reading of the book, I was constantly thinking what a great movie it was going to make. Turns out I was wrong...It's tough to describe what actually happened to make the movie so boring. I think it's because the writers stayed too true to the book. You'd think that would make a better movie, but what ends up happening is that we get a lot of pointless, annoying, unnecessary flashbacks along with a lot of drawn out, agonizing monologues from the main characters. In movie form, these methods of communication just don't really translate to exciting cinema. I sat stationary for pretty much the entire film. Never once was I excited. I know you're saying that of course I wouldn't be excited because I knew what was coming, but if a book to film transition is done well, watching the movie can be a whole new experience, and that definitely didn't happen here. I basically felt dead inside while watching the movie.I really did want to like this movie. In fact, at the end of the film the writers added on some dialogue between Robert and Sophie that made me want to like it even more. In this conversation, Robert talks about prayer, and ""what matters is what you believe."" Does it even really change anything if Jesus was married and fathered a child? I don't really have a set belief on that yet, but I am leaning towards no. The ending dialogue really showed me that the filmmakers just wanted to make a good movie. They failed, but at least they won't offend anyone by what they did.",3,An exercise in mediocrity,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,2200,"['Do', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'more', 'attitude', 'lot', 'people', 'use', 'life', 'work', 'family', 'relationships', 'attitude', 'people', 'lives', 'totally', 'unimpressive', 'exact', 'same', 'attitude', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'exercise', 'mediocrity.Let', 'say', 'review', 'being', 'written', 'film', 'geek', 'not', 'Christian', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'see', 'movie', 'horrid', 'reviews', 'still', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'was', 'being', 'based', 'such', 'entertaining', 'source', 'material', 'book', 'was', 'pretty', 'crappy', 'writing', 'was', 'definitely', 'page-turner', 'reading', 'book', 'was', 'constantly', 'thinking', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'out', 'was', 'wrong', 'tough', 'describe', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'make', 'movie', 'so', 'boring', 'think', 'writers', 'stayed', 'too', 'true', 'book', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'make', 'better', 'movie', 'what', 'up', 'happening', 'get', 'lot', 'pointless', 'annoying', 'unnecessary', 'flashbacks', 'lot', 'drawn', 'agonizing', 'monologues', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'form', 'methods', 'communication', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'translate', 'exciting', 'cinema', 'sat', 'stationary', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'film', 'Never', 'once', 'was', 'excited', 'know', ""'re"", 'saying', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'excited', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'book', 'film', 'transition', 'done', 'well', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'whole', 'new', 'experience', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here', 'basically', 'felt', 'dead', 'watching', 'movie.I', 'really', 'did', 'want', 'like', 'movie', 'fact', 'end', 'film', 'writers', 'added', 'dialogue', 'Robert', 'Sophie', 'made', 'want', 'like', 'even', 'more', 'conversation', 'Robert', 'talks', 'prayer', 'what', 'what', 'believe', 'even', 'really', 'change', 'anything', 'Jesus', 'was', 'married', 'fathered', 'child', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'set', 'belief', 'yet', 'am', 'leaning', 'ending', 'dialogue', 'really', 'showed', 'filmmakers', 'just', 'wanted', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'failed', 'least', 'wo', ""n't"", 'offend', 'anyone', 'what', 'did']",N/A

We don't know anything about the character's lives, motivations, values, feelings, etc., because IT WAS NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK. And the movie's director wasn't clever enough to figure that out... It is a WASTE OF TIME to watch the movie, when you already read the book. In the first 20 minutes, the movie seems to be in a hurry, trying to cover hundreads of pages of the book. Then, maybe the director realized that it was useless to run between chapters at the speed of light, because there was so much to tell and NOTHING TO SAY. The characters remain being pieces of written paper. WHAT HAPPENS is much more important than WHY.

We wanted to go to the movies and she likes Tom Hanks more than I like Jennifer Aniston.  So, we didn't go into this movie with any particular expectations.  I don't particularly want to delve into the religious controversy surrounding the book or the movie, as my personal views render all such arguments rather pointless.  What I can say is that yes, this was an enjoyable movie, well made, fairly balanced (likely to irritate and please people on boths sides of the debate) in it's perspective, well made and an enjoyable time.I think this film also did a nice job of reminding all of us not to simply believe what other people tell us, whatever they might say, regardless of how little sense it might make to us personally, simply because believing what we're told is easier than sorting out the truth for ourselves.

Reviews in local papers have been saying ""it's too slow"" and then in the same article ""it moves too quickly"" I couldn't figure out how that made sense, after seeing the movie, I now understand. The book is a fascinating page turner, the movie on the other hand seems to drag along while flashing scene after scene at a breakneck speed.I think if you haven't read the book you may find the movie interesting, yet you may be confused as to how certain things happen, the movie skips details that you understand only having read the book. The biggest flaw for me was the ending. The movie altered it somewhat. It ties together all the loose strings just as the book did, yet the knot was made very differently. For me that is the problem. Also a  joke is thrown in at the end that for me totally ruined things. Finally it seems as if the ending is a wee bit too politically correct.Overall the movie comes off feeling very sloppy and too chaotic. It could have and should have been so much better.

Argghh!Other less dominant ideas:Tom Hanks lacks the kind of curiousity and 'radical edge' Robert Langdon could do with a good dose of, IMO. Personally I found Hanks' Langdon too, err...plain (see how easily he was outshadowed by the appearance of Ian McKellen. I think the wild-eyedness and eccentricity of Gary Oldman, Johnny Depp, Harrison Ford or Colin Farrell could've boosted the movie substantially.Audrey Tautou? Should've done an Am&eacute;lie sequel. She looks perfect for the kind of girl who gets saved by a 100-foot ape and taken to the top of some sky-scraper. I thought Monica Belucci showed more depth in Tears of the Sun. But it could be just me.Other than the colourful code-solving/breaking graphics, nothing else in the movie is worth being ""motion-pictured"", especially if you've already read the book. C'mon, I've seen better action takes in a Jackie Chan movie from the 80s'. I've come across WAY better conversation and dialogue in films like A Few Good Men, Any Given Sunday, LOTR, even Star Wars. And the Passion beats the Code hands-down in a religious visceralgia contest (granted they're two different kinds of movie, but I suspect Howard was aiming for the spiritually ""breath-taking"" almost as much as Gibson was)Theological affronts? Strictly speaking: Not much. Well, yeah, Jesus' divinity was thrown out the window (which is something almost EVERY HOLLYWOOD MOVIE hints at or implies, so seriously: What is the big deal? Who still thinks America is a 'Christian' nation, anyway?) but then again how many people who agree that ""Jesus is God"" even understand this statement, let alone live it?Also, I get the impression that Brown's characters are of the view that Jesus' marriage to Mary Magdalene and him having kids de facto invalidate the Church's understanding of his divinity, as if everything stood or fell with Jesus' starting a family. But maybe it should be reminded that Jesus' mission of reconciling the world to God, saving it, jump-starting a new way of being human - seriously -ain't got nuts to do with him having a wife and a baby! In fact, I would think Jesus taking a wife VALIDATES God's love for creation, for the body, for sexual love, for marital union, for family, for fatherhood etc etc. etc.!But(!!):We have very poor historical evidence that Jesus did marry and lots to suggest he did not, so if we're talking historical event, then Brown's got a lot more to do than rehash the Templar Knights theorySo why didn't Jesus marry? I'm just guessing here (so what else is new in historical studies, eh?) but :given his impending death, it wouldn't have been the most responsible thing to do to leave behind a widow and fatherless child.given the power-plays inevitably involved with kings, successions and such, it wouldn't have helped to have many little Jesus' running around (the disciples were persecuted badly enough! andmaybe Jesus was celibate, as was the case with most Jewish prophetsThe revisionist premise of Jesus being a dad shouldn't have created such a stir even if it did occur. As long as there's an empty tomb, the church - if it understood the message of Jesus - wouldn't NEED to do a ""cover up"", let alone give the dodgy Templar Knights a blank cheque of power only to conduct Mafia-style executions later on (though of course these latter events are, according to Brown's thesis, a result of the church believing that Jesus was only human and nothing more. The point is that there is an unquestioned ""link"" - seemingly accepted by both Brown AND his conservative Christian critics! - that Jesus' marriage entails his mere humanity).The Priory of Sion can very well reveal a sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene this very minute, it really really shouldn't change a thing (so Mary was buried in a nice ancient coffin with images carved on it - so what?). The tomb of Jesus remains empty, the victory of God secured, the people of God hopeful.And Ron Howard's gotta make better movies.

I am only one person, but I actually DID watch the movie, and here are some of my thoughts.Q. Does it vilify the Catholic Church and the Opus Dei?A. Yes, if I were Catholic I would not like this movie.  Churches seem to be prime targets for attack these days.  Perhaps Christianity is one of the few scape goats left that can be used for villains without raising too much of a backlash.  Although I think this is changing and Ron Howard and Tom Hanks toned down the movie to the point that it is almost acceptable.  Most viewers will see this as more fantasy than an attack on the Catholic Church.Q. Is this movie Christian?A. No, it presents paganism as a viable belief system opposed to Christianity.  It presents Christianity as a source of evil in the world.Q. Is it historical?A. Hard to answer, it does contain historical references.  Some are true, some are debatable, and some have no scholarly basis at all.Q. Is it a danger to Christianity?A. No, the movie doesn't carry the same atmosphere of realism that the book carries.Q. Is it interesting?A. Yes, I went with several other people who had not read the book.  They all liked it and could follow the story line.  The monk, Silas, does an excellent part with his role.  Several of the other characters are well acted.  The movie is a little slow compared to the book, but keeps moving.My Final Analysis:This is not as good as some say and not as bad as others say.

639611,A26R4PDCZX5SOK,B00005JOC9,"Amazon Customer ""The World According to JimG944""","[0, 0]","5 of 5 stars for the movie The Da Vinci Code. This is the first of (currently) three books in the Robert Langdon series. Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a specialist in symbology (the history and meaning of various symbols from different cultures. Langdon is called to help the police in Paris with a murder. This starts a long chain of events in which various religious factions are chasing ""the Holy Grail"". Langdon gains the help of a police officer who is the daughter of the murder victim. As the complex puzzle grows, Langdon reaches out for help from an old friend. This chain of events has several surprises as we learn some people are not who they appear to be (e.g. the lead police detective is actually a member of one of the religious factions and is trying to frame Langdon for the murder). Even Langdon's old friend is not exactly who he appears, nor is his butler! Complex, interesting, exciting and compelling is this story. Langdon is no James Bond, but, he does well during action moments. Langdon somewhat reminds me of Indiana Jones; college profession who has interesting adventures with historical artifacts and legends.A shout-out to Ron Howard for outstanding Direction of this movie! I feel the movie was totally faithful to the book. The last 5 minutes of the movie is totally wonderful (from Langdon's shaving accident). I can watch it over and over. On the Blu-Ray, there are details on how this scene was created. Simply Wow!Much has been written and debated over the historical validity of Brown's story and assertions. If you set aside those various debates and opinions and just take it as a story of fiction, it is a very good movie!

639613,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00005JOC9,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[6, 11]","When will people learn to stop judging movies based off of the merits of the books?  Probably never, seeing as how I am guilty of that as well.  While I enjoy the Harry Potter films, I can't seem to get over how much better the books are.  Books and film are two very different media, and it is pretty much impossible to completely reconicle the two (though Sin City came very close).  I will admit that the book The DaVinci Code is much ""better"" than the film, but that doesn't make the film bad.Before I go into the explanation of the book/film debate, as well as the controversy of the film, I will first go over the story for the few of you who don't know it yet.  Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a renowned Harvard professor who is an expert in symbology, or the study of the meaning of ancient symbols.  While lecturing in Paris, France, he is contacted by the French police who tell him that they require his help in a murder case.  Earlier that night, Jaques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle), the curator of the Louvre, was shot and killed.  However, with his last breaths, he used a pen with ultraviolet-sensitive ink to write a message as well as cutting symbols into his own flesh and arranging his body to resemble Leonardo DaVinci's famous sketch, The Vitruvian Man.  The police are baffled by the fact that, instead of trying to identify his killer, Sauniere instead chose to leave cryptic clues.  Soon, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tatou), a cryptologist for the French police, arrives to aid the investigation.  However, she is able to secretly pass off a message to Langdon in which she states that he is in danger; Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) erased part of the message that supposedly implicates Langdon in the murder, and Fache only brought Langdon in to force a confession.  Langdon and Neveu decide that, in order to decipher Sauniere's puzzles, they must escape, but in the process, they realize that the clues lead them to different paintings by DaVinci, eventually leading them to a special key bearing the mark of the Priory of Scion.Langdon explained to Sophie that the Priory of Scion is an ancient secret society dating back to the days of Christ, and that they are charged with keeping an ancient secret so powerful, that if it were to be released, it would shake the very foundations of the Catholic church.  Priory members have been hunted for centuries by church, hoping to prevent such a secret from coming out.  Numerous prominent historical figures are rumored to have been members, including Victor Hugo, Sir Issac Newton, and Leonardo DaVinci.  While Langdon was never sure he believed that the Priory ever actually existed, a monk named Silas (Paul Bettany), who is receiving orders from a Bishop (Alfred Molina), who in turn is getting his orders from a man known only as the teacher, ruthlessly hunts for Langdon and Neveu.  He is responsible for Sauniere's death, and he will stop at nothing to silence the Priory once and for all.  Rounding out the cast is Sir Ian McKellan, playing Sir Leigh Teabing, a biblical scholar.  Teabing is an old friend of Langdon, and he helps further explain the secret and its true power.Any problems the film may have definitely do not have to do with the actors.  Everyone involved gives great performances, especially McKellan, who seems to be able to do no wrong in his roles.  The ""problems"" have to do with the translation from book to film.  The story is, for all intents and purposes, a treasure hunt, with some very difficult clues linking the destinations.  In the book, the author isn't restricted by time limits, so Dan Brown was able to allow a lot more time for Langon, Sophie, and Teabing to decipher their clues, while giving Fache time to pursue his leads on finding the trio.  Ron Howard only has about 2 hours, and with so much story and expostion to get through, the characters have to figure things out a lot quicker in order to advance the plot.  We merely have to suspend our disbelief a little more than we would in the book.Speaking of suspending our disbelief, I cannot reiterate enough that Dan Brown wrote a fictional book.  He wrote a story to entertain, not to teach or challenge the church.  With that in mind, I can't believe how much controversy there has been surrounding this film.  Many religious groups have called for this film to be banned, stating that its subject matter is blasphemous.  Some countries succeeded in getting it banned, while many people in the United States are actively protesting.  Just look at some of the reviews on this site.  It is obvious that the writers haven't seen the film, but they disagree with the secret (which, unfortunately, a few of them reveal, so if you don't want to be spoiled, be very careful when picking which reviews to read).  It's too bad that so many people are so close-minded and cannot understand what fiction means.  The DaVinci Code is a great story that everyone should definitely read, and most people should see (I can understand how some fans of the book would be put off by the film).  Ron Howard and company have given us a good movie with a cool plot, solid acting, and good effects.

639622,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,B00005JOC9,A. Schneider,"[3, 5]","Knowing what it takes to make a good movie, I was skeptical when I heard that ""The Da Vinci Code"" was coming out on the big screen. Somewhat in-depth descriptions, research side notes, and character thoughts are hard to get across on the big screen and I knew that unless ""The Da Vinci Code"" was superbly constructed, it would probably end up failing.Not dissuaded by negative reviews I decided to see the movie as soon as I could. I have to admit, the ""Da Vinci Code"" as a movie does not fail as I had expected it to but it does lack in something fundamental.Having read the book I found myself deeply engaged in the storyline and found the on-screen portrayal of the events I had previously imagined actually come to life in a way that paid homage to the novel. That's what the movie does best, you see, it follows the text so closely that the average moviegoer might feel as though he or she is missing the appeal whereas fans of the book are more likely to feel a connection with the film.While the film is somewhat long, it's missing a lot of content that only a book could accurately deliver. That is to say there are emotional links and explanations for things found within the book that cinema simply can't master on the same level, or at the very least using the same techniques. A certain amount of creativity is required on the part of the director in order to convey such things either didactically or through representation.In this last regard Ron Howard fails terribly. Essentially the film ""The Da Vinci Code"" remains a filmic adaptation of a book with no style or creativity of its own, creativity essential to success for a cinematic experience. It is no wonder then that this movie scores so low on reviews, and yet I'm inclined to believe that for some people - fans with no expectations of it being something more than what it was - it should receive some praise.I've decided to give ""The Da Vinci Code"" a 3 (simply ""Good"" but leaning toward the ""Why?"" side), and yet it does have the potential to be a great supplement to the book. And yet  I'm sooner inclined to hand the book to a curious friend than suggest seeing the movie.",3,"Good, nothing more or less",1148515200,"05 25, 2006",2006,2149,"['Knowing', 'what', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'skeptical', 'when', 'heard', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'big', 'screen', 'Somewhat', 'in-depth', 'descriptions', 'research', 'side', 'notes', 'character', 'thoughts', 'are', 'hard', 'get', 'big', 'screen', 'knew', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'was', 'superbly', 'constructed', 'would', 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'failing.Not', 'dissuaded', 'negative', 'reviews', 'decided', 'see', 'movie', 'as', 'soon', 'could', 'have', 'admit', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'movie', 'not', 'fail', 'had', 'expected', 'lack', 'something', 'fundamental.Having', 'read', 'book', 'found', 'deeply', 'engaged', 'storyline', 'found', 'on-screen', 'portrayal', 'events', 'had', 'previously', 'imagined', 'actually', 'come', 'life', 'way', 'paid', 'homage', 'novel', 'what', 'movie', 'best', 'see', 'text', 'so', 'closely', 'average', 'moviegoer', 'might', 'feel', 'missing', 'appeal', 'whereas', 'fans', 'book', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'feel', 'connection', 'film.While', 'film', 'somewhat', 'long', 'missing', 'lot', 'content', 'only', 'book', 'could', 'accurately', 'deliver', 'say', 'are', 'emotional', 'links', 'explanations', 'things', 'found', 'book', 'cinema', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'master', 'same', 'level', 'very', 'least', 'using', 'same', 'techniques', 'certain', 'amount', 'creativity', 'required', 'part', 'director', 'order', 'convey', 'such', 'things', 'didactically', 'representation.In', 'last', 'regard', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'terribly', 'Essentially', 'film', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'filmic', 'adaptation', 'book', 'style', 'creativity', 'own', 'creativity', 'essential', 'success', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'wonder', 'then', 'movie', 'so', 'low', 'reviews', 'yet', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'believe', 'people', 'fans', 'expectations', 'being', 'something', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'should', 'receive', 'praise.I', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'give', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', '3', 'simply', 'Good', 'leaning', 'Why', 'side', 'yet', 'have', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'supplement', 'book', 'yet', ""'m"", 'sooner', 'inclined', 'hand', 'book', 'curious', 'friend', 'suggest', 'seeing', 'movie']",N/A
639623,A2VMT89TCSF105,B00005JOC9,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[8, 29]","Recently, no-longer-so-Red China prohibited the movie ""The Da Vinci Code"", after only two weeks of airing. Thank God. At least there is some Western trash the Chinese audience don't have to endure. Apparently, the movie have also been banned at the Faroe Islands (of all places). Once again: Thank you.Although the movie slightly downplays the most controversial claims in Dan Brown's novel, the basic message is still the same. All these ideas have been refuted by serious scholars (including secular ones) long ago. Jesus was not married to Mary Magdalene and didn't sire children with her. Constantine didn't invent the Christian Bible. In fact, all or most of the New Testament (NT) was written 200 years earlier. Nor was Constantine the first to declare Jesus a God. His purported divinity is spelled out already in the NT, most clearly in the Gospel of John, written around AD 100. The Gnostic gospels, in which Mary Magdalene is portrayed as the chief disciple of Jesus, were written long after the NT Gospels. Besides, the Gnostics also regarded Jesus as divine! Et cetera.Thus, the movie doesn't expose any cover-up. Rather, it and Dan Brown's novel are themselves part of a cover-up. Brown wants to replace one religious myth (the Christian) with another (his own). I'm not a Christian, but the Church is at least a public institution, with a public message. Dan Brown's alternative is presumably a secret sex cult, carrying out bizarre rituals reminescent of Satanic ritual abuse, and led by a Grand Master with a penchant for pentagrams and other Satanist paraphernalia. In the movie, the members of this secret society, ""The Priory of Zion"", are depicted as the good guys. By contrast, ""The Teacher"", who wants to expose both the Church and the Priory, thereby ending ALL conspiracies for good, is one of the bad guys!In fact, I found Teabing or the Teacher to be the only sympathetic person in the entire movie, a sort of expose-em-all David Icke character (and I must admit that I don't usually like Icke).Incidentally, who engineered the car accident that killed Sophie's father and mother anyway? The movie never says, but we are left with the impression that it might have been the Priory after all. Thus, the ""good"" guys.So the muckracker is the bad guy, and the secret manipulative Satanic cult are not really Satanists at all, but jolly nice people. Oh yeah? So why do they operate in secret, then? Obviously, because they have something to hide, not only from ""the council of shadows"", but from the rest of us as well. It might be well to remember that many of the ideas in Dan Brown's novel originally comes from Pierre Plantard, a French right-wing extremist. Besides, the conspiracy theory of history is usually associated with the far right of the political spectrum. These essentially elitist and fascist ideas have then been neatly edited into a vaguely ""New Age"" version and voila, we have ""The Da Vinci Code"".Make no mistake about it. ""The Da Vinci Code"" might be a bad movie, but the ideas behind it are even worse. Not just for the odd traditional Christian, but for all of us. Sincerely, do you want a world ruled by the Priory of Zion? If forced to chose, I rather go with the most boring, philistine Anglican vicar!",1,Long live Teabing a.k.a.

So it is clearly worthwhile to experience both. In this case, the movie should probably come first, so as to give the reader some visual images to help in understanding the book.Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is an expert in symbols, and specifically in historical symbols. His name was on the appointment book of the murdered curator of the Louvre, and the police naturally come looking for him to explain the symbolism associated with the body. In fact, the body was laid out on the floor of the grand gallery in imitation of the Vetruvian Man, one of DaVinci's most famous drawings. While Langdon is able to explain some things to the police, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) shows up. She is a cryptologist for the police department, and so the policemen on the case believe her when she says the department sent her there. She says she comes with an urgent message for Langdon from the American embassy.But as we quickly learn in this movie, nothing and no one is what it seems, people lie and misdirect and do enigmatic things so fast and confusingly that all the audience can say is well, it will make sense later on. And credit to both author Dan Brown and director Ron Howard, they do. No significant loose ends remain at the end of the film except one: the answer to the question ""What will Sophie do now?"" You have to get there to understand how significant that question is.The heart of the story is some history which can be interpreted in different ways, and some archeology, and more than a little speculation. There has long been a suggestion that the Holy Grail is not a chalice used at the Last Supper, but something more secret. And it is true that no single chalice is in front of Jesus in the DaVinci painting of the last supper. Instead, each place is set with a small and rather ordinary cup. And all the things said about that painting and about the Mona Lisa are true and can be verified by checking any decent reproduction of these extremely famous paintings. The interpretations are not all Dan Brown's, either, but collected from a variety of sources.So if you want to discover exactly how much truth is in the story (which is admittedly fiction), one thing you will need to do is look closely at those two paintings, at least in good copies. Another would be to research the truth of various architectural gems which are referenced in the story, although Brown states at the outset that they are true. Certainly just taking his word for it is not good enough. The church history he expounds would also have to be examined closely for the truth of many assertions.I've not done that, nor have I examined the various conflicting claims as to what is or is not true which have been done by others, at least not in any great detail. But then I don't have a problem with saying that it may or may not be true and leaving it at that. The ability to suspend judgment is a useful art. ""Maybe"" is a very, very useful word.

639640,A30TQET02FLSUX,B00005JOC9,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[0, 0]","The Da Vinci Code (2006) is a very interesting story and idea. But I'm not sure the film was executed as well as it could have been. Director Ron Howard just wasn't able to capture me in his storytelling quite as well as he usually does. I haven't read the book, so I had no bias or expectations for the film, other than I had heard mixed reviews of it over the years and wanted to see it so I could see what all the fuss was about. I actually watched Angels & Demons (2009) before seeing The Da Vinci Code, and my review here of The Da Vinci Code pretty much applies to that film as well. I give both films 3 stars out of 5. They are both worthy of viewing once, but I'm not sure there's much that would compel me to watch them again beyond that.I'm not going to bore you with a synopsis of the film's story since you're probably aware of it from reading the book or seeing the film. Plus the plot is one of the main problems with the movie as I see it. I really don't want to waste my time trying to rehash it or understand it since it didn't do much for me. Read Roger Ebert's review if you want more detail and another opinion on this film. While Ebert gives this film higher praise than I think it deserves, I do agree that Ron Howard and his team bring their incredible filmmaking craft to this story and they do their best to make the movie compelling on a cinematic level. I just wish there was a little more tightness in the editing and storytelling that would help the pacing and action of the film move along more like The Bourne movies.The acting by Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen and the rest of the ensemble is good. But it all felt a little too stiff and staged to me. There are some really good scenes in The Da Vinci Code, but there is a lot of filler too. I just kept looking at my watch while viewing the extended cut blu-ray version. This is one film that didn't need to be extended. The ""thriller"" aspect that was supposed to be what moved this film forward, just wasn't thrilling enough. And I'm at a loss as to why.The film looked spectacular on bluray, with excellent cinematography and production design. And Hans Zimmer created a perfect score for the film, culminating with his top notch track ""Chevaliers de Sangreal"" for the final scene. I listen to that track all the time now, and it has become one of my favorite pieces of Zimmer's music. I think the best part of The Da Vinci Code is the final scene with Hanks following clues around Paris to his final mysterious discovery. The editing of that scene is fantastic and Zimmer's music makes it all work. I just wish that the magic that's in that final scene was in the rest of the movie. If I do watch The Da Vinci Code again, it will be because of those final few minutes. Sometimes a second viewing of a film with a complex and ""absurd"" mystery plot like this one can make the film better.

As for the story: well, Leigh Baigent's ideas are quite interesting to read, but they don't convince and don't add up to much, like everybody says. The producers must have been delighted by the bans on religious grounds, here and there. Christ's basic principles (if he ever existed) boil down to love your neighbour and turn the other cheek. Can't say, considering its history, the Catholic church has applied them to any great extent. Nor have many other religions, for that matter, though there may be one or two exceptions. Too concerned with enforcing their beliefs on others, and being boss. Unfortunately Christ's ideas may be OK in theory, but the first one is very often almost impossible to implement, and the second simply doesn't work in practice.

But give us a good story that'll engage film audiences!""I've read The Da Vinci Code and I must say that the book was interesting, but I felt it didn't live up to the hype surrounding it. I was continually astounded to see it on the bestseller list month after month after month. I kept asking myself, ""Did I miss something? Was it really THAT good?"" Maybe. Either way, however, I approached this film with a fairly high level of trepidation. ""Will the movie be over-hyped, too?""I'm happy to say that this is an adequate film (thus my thumbs up rating.) But I don't believe it'll stay in theaters as long as the book stayed on the bestseller lists.The film DOES follow the book surprisingly well. Tom Hanks plays symbologist Robert Langdon. He's in Paris autographing his latest book when a police officer approaches and asks him to come to the Louvre. Once there, Mr. Hanks discovers that a murder has taken place. A curator that Mr. Langdon was supposed to meet that night was murdered and his body desecrated. But it appears the dead curator desecrated his own body. But why?Sophie Neveu, a young detective played by Audrey Tautou, arrives at the scene and soon Mr. Langdon's life begins to unravel. Trapped by the French police, a murder investigation in which he is the prime suspect, a secret society of ultra-worshippers known as the Opus Dei, and a group of Templar Knights in hiding, Robert Langdon is quickly whisked into a life of puzzle solving in order to find a secret that could unravel Christianity as we know it.Much controversy surrounded the film before its release. The main controversy was from albinos. Amazingly I heard nothing from this group while the book was out, but now that the film is here, they've emerged from the woodwork. Why? I'll let you all think about that one on your own.There have been complaints, too, that the film is ""too slow to get going"" or that Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou gave wooden performances. I didn't see that.I will complain about Tom Hanks in this role, however. I'm sure Ron Howard and he work together comfortably after their previous collaborations ...from SPLASH to APOLLO 13. But I just couldn't swallow Mr. Hanks as the prime character. There was zero chemistry between him and Mrs. Tautou, and his long hair was ...well ...nasty looking (like it needed a good washing.) He's getting up there in age and I think Clive Owen or some other up-and-coming actor would've been a wiser choice.

639645,A7S83KW2BH20D,B00005JOC9,"book worm ""book worm""","[3, 10]","Reading many of the 317 reviews (so far) about this movie has been more fun than watching the movie. It has elicited more emotions and laughter than the movie itself. This movie has had the capacity to move some to call it ""beautiful"" and others ""boring."" To some, the movie was a zero star for its ""attack on Christianity"" and for others was a ***** star execution of a plot with a twist, and a carbon-copy of its fictional novel. The reception of the movie in Europe, according to critics, was a big letdown (because of ""too much talking"" and not much character development) while the reception in the US, according to box-office opening weekend ($77 million) was a great success.I believe that if you like conspiratorial/thriller type movies you will find this movie acceptable (thus my ***). That is if you do not let its historical inaccuracies get to you. I do think the characters would have benefited from more personal details, and that the plot was a bit rushed.  Although, there is no field such as the one of ""symbology"" I like the introduction of the movie where symbols are discussed and how when we dig below the surface we find a fascinating world of meaning and perception.  I will not review the plot, as many other reviewers did such a good job at. Instead I will intrigue you to look at the movie from a different lens.I have to admit. I did not read the book (no time, no interest), but read enough articles disputing the historical inacuracies to know that this was not ""the greatest story ever told.""I find the whole attitude of people towards the movie (and especially the original book) quite fascinating. It's a great sociological experiment on how much a fictional novel, that presents a very outrageous idea (that Jesus fathered a daughter with Mary Magdalena and was not divine) or insignificant idea to others (that keeping the secret of the bloodline alive is of mortal importance), can move people emotionally and how much discussion it can generate. Some would say, ""a lot of ballyhoo for a work of fiction,"" while others will keep the author's feet to the fire (Dan Brown) for saying that he believes the thesis of the book to be real (ABC News, Nov.03, 2004) and for writing that ""all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate"" introduction (which also shows up in the movie).Let's get real. The movie and book is sold as fiction (yet presented well enough to almost pass for non-fiction/historical). For the un-discerning souls and some gullible young minds this movie (and book) can possibly shape their attitude towards Christianity. The story does a lot of damage. I am a conservative Protestant Christian, and there were some spots in the movie when I felt that the movie directly attacked Roman-Catholic Christianity while slyly exonerating the Vatican and Opus Dei organization from any knowledge of this ""greatest story ever told."" I believe that because this fictional movie and book present an alternative to the ""original greatest story ever told"" (the birth, death, resurrection, and ascension to heaven of Jesus, the Messiah) it has caused a lot of discussion and intrigue in our society. In our post-Christian and post-modern society where relativism rules such lines as ""Would a successor of Jesus Christ destroy 'faith'? Or renew it? What really matters is what YOU believe"" will be popular.For me, the transcendent reality is just as important as our physical reality, and as such the mystical and spiritual are just as important (if not more) than the exoteric stories and symbolic representations. Therefore, it is not about what I believe, but what Providence (the Transcendental) believes about me, that makes 'faith' real.For my part, I rented the movie and helped a local family business (thus my conscience is clear) and I would not hesitate to share the positives and disappointments that I have had about this movie with anyone (thought the music definitely enhanced the thriller/conspiratorial theme, and some cinematographic scenes were spectacular). If you're a Christian and will be taking the movie too seriously, I would not recommend you watch it. I watched it, because I did not want to die and not know what the big hoopla was all about (over 12 counter/anti Dan Brown/Da Vinci Code books published) and also wanted to see the story that presented all those historical inaccuracies I have been reading.In the end, enjoy this fictional thriller. It was Much ado about Nothing. If anything, a great lesson about American sociology/psychology when it comes to controversial stories (never mind that Dan Brown basically plagerized the plot and the clues from two previously published books). For something depicting the ""original greatest story ever told"" I would recommend watching the upcoming ""The Nativity Story."" ... Now, that is a story of 'faith.'",3,Much ado about Nothing ...

639646,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B00005JOC9,Boss Fan,"[11, 21]","As per usual when a movie comes out that touches a political or religious nerve in this country (whether that is the film's intent or not) this forum automatically turns into a place for everyone who feels strongly to each extreme of the issue - in this case it's 'is the material sacrilegious?' - to play a big game of opinion-hot-potato, and useless point/counter-point with those who think the opposite.Set aside the fact that here at Amazon we are supposed to be giving our opinions about a products worth and quality; why we liked it or why we didn't, but when it comes to the people who bash or defend controversial movies like this based solely on the stance they think they would take given the propaganda they have been led to believe, almost none of them have even seen the film they are so vehemently defending or decrying.Such is the case here.  Out of 12 or so reviews I count maybe three that represent an actual movie review, not just some idiot from one end of the spectrum shooting off their mouth.  This happens all the time.  See reviews for ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" ""The Passion...,"" ""United 93,"" even Bruce Springsteen and Dixie Chicks albums as of late - and that's just the tip of a huge iceberg of examples.  I understand people are passionate about their views, and become even more so when they read reviews here that get under their skin and they have to give some back.  And neither is right or wrong since we are all entitled to our opinions and to share them.  But see or hear the thing before you offer in your two cents.  And try to keep an open mind.  And critique the item for what it is, not because of some outside controversy it really doesn't deserve.  Something like ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is what it is and I suppose you know right away where you stand on its message, however, something like ""United 93,"" where people are calling it a cash-in on tragedy, needs to be seen before you decide you indeed believe that is where the film is coming from.Also, I don't know when people are going to realize that the bigger deal that is made of something, the more you protest it, the more attention you will draw to it.But I digress.  I'm just tired of wading through all these non-reviews of premature, suspected outrage or raves of joy just because the subject matter matches up to ones personal politics or faith.  True, most people will say the same things they would have said before seeing such a movie as after, simply because it reinforces their worldview, but try this on for an honest review:  As a movie, this thing sucks!I don't see anything wrong with a fictionalized, ""what if"" story of this nature (how is the ""what if Jesus were married, etc."" not an interesting question to ponder, and why is it sacrilege?  It's thinking about things had they been different - not saying they were.  What if I ponder the idea that pigs could fly, does that insult both pigs and their creator?  I was raised Catholic-lite; I didn't, and don't, go to church much, but I do have a certain amount of faith and think religion and faith are important, but to each his own.I mention all these things, because, before I get into why this movie is so lousy, it is important to me that my review doesn't come off as what I just finished bashing, having readers figure my opinion is because , `oh, he must be a Catholic,' or `oh, he must be an atheist.'  I don't know religion.  I know movies.  I have no business debating the issues that everyone here and in other forums are arguing about when reviewing this movie (my guess is most of them don't either).  I do have the right to speak on this film because I have actually seen it (what a concept, huh?).This film, given the huge hit the book was, the talent involved both in front of and behind the camera, and how anticipated it has been, is simply A MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT.  That is the kindest thing that can be said about it.  I could really rip it up and down if I wanted to get technical about everything that was wrong with it from a filmmaking standpoint, but I'll give it this, it is polished enough (thanks to a big budget and that talent I was talking about) a less experienced movie-goer might not notice some of the stuff that irritated me so much.  What everyone will notice, however, is what a slog it is to get through this clap-trap of over-baked hooey.The film is either too much or not enough.  It will frustrate those who have read the book and those who have not but trust Hank's and Howard's track records, and/or just assume by the trailers they are in for an entertaining and provocative thriller.This movie stalls in all of those gears.  It is deadly boring, bland, and really seams rather anti-climactic (read pointless) given all the fuss over the book, and now all the controversy that has been created about the movie (again, before it has been seen by most).  It's hard for me to believe that any of this would really upset anyone who has actually seen it.  If you are among the protesters, check this film out, your worst fears will be quickly put to rest.  This movie will inspire no Catholic Church upheaval.  Your second worst fear, however, that you will be stuck for more than 2 and a half head-propping hours will soon be realized.Unfortunately, for my part, that is the worst I fear of a movie.  I had my doubts going in to this one, but critical and commercial success seamed almost assured so I wanted to be in the loop.  I wish I would have waited. The reviews have been overwhelmingly negative and for once audiences will agree with the critics.""The Da Vinci Code"" is doomed to suffer from its hype.  But that's not, because it was over-hyped, it's because it doesn't seem as though it is trying to live up to even a fraction of it.  It is dull, blandly acted and executed and monotonous.  It is part conspiracy thriller, part religious treatise, part psychological melodrama, but it is not satisfying on any of these levels.  The dialogue is overblown to the point of comedy and everything except the camera work and cinematography is excruciatingly dull.  Yes, even - especially- Hanks.  I guess he was going for understated.  He comes off as sedated.  Might as well, though, that's how the viewer comes away.If you didn't get it by me calling this movie boring in 50 different ways, the film lacks suspense - the suspense of the novel as well as any other kind.  It is far too long, talky and drab.  If you are one of those people who is always saying the movie is never as good as the book, you're case just got one film stronger.Here is a great outtake from Roger Ebert's review:  ""Both [the book and the movie] contain accusations against the Catholic Church and its order of Opus Dei that would be scandalous if anyone of sound mind could possibly entertain them. I know there are people who believe Brown's fantasies about the Holy Grail, the descendants of Jesus, the Knights Templar, Opus Dei and the true story of Mary Magdalene. This has the advantage of distracting them from the theory that the Pentagon was not hit by an airplane.""  And he gave the film a positive review (!), calling it ""preposterously entertaining.""  While I find nothing about this snail of a movie very entertaining, it is nice to see a major critic recommend something about which he disagrees.  His way of saying what I spent the first half of this review saying:  I feel sorry for those of you that can not separate entertainment from your personal politics.  It's a movie, people!  It's fiction.  But it's a bad one, so if your dumb hang-ups keep you away from theatres, than consider yourself lucky that, for once, they worked in your favor.",1,"Trust Me - I've Actually Seen This Movie - And

639650,AWNKEM8DAG8PY,B00005JOC9,Brian Conway,"[1, 6]","Based on the best-selling novel that took the world by storm, the film version of The Da Vinci Code, directed by Ron Howard, has been eagerly anticipated by fans ever since the book hit the shelves in 2003. When Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), a world renowned symbologist, is brought in to help investigate a bizzare murder he meets cryptographer Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou). When she tells him that he has become a suspect in the murder, they quickly gather up the clues from the crime scene and try to escape. This results in the two being chased first by the police and then by assassins in the employ of Opus Dei as they continue to uncover a conspiracy that the Vatican wishes to remain a mystery. The film moves at a brisk pace, with twists and turns abound along with plenty of revelations for conspiracy theorists to revel in. However, the movie seems to drag on due to Howard's urge to cram every bit of information possible into the massive 149 minute runtime. It also doesn't help that the surprises, though fun, are fairly predictable. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that the characters, no matter how much backstory they are given, seem like nothing more than vehicles to push the plot forward; even Paul Bettany's albino monk assassin, Silas, a character with obvious cinematic potential, feels sterile. These weaknesses can result in some scenes feeling a little flat where any one of those missing elements could have bolstered such moments admirably. The film isn't all bad but the negatives, unfortunately, weigh in almost even with the postives. Had Akiva Goldsman been able to infuse the characters with some humanity and a few scenes been left on the cutting room floor, The Da Vinci Code would have been the lean and exciting thriller that fans had been expecting.",3,The Da Vinci Code (3 stars),1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,1804,"['Based', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'took', 'world', 'storm', 'film', 'version', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'directed', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'been', 'eagerly', 'anticipated', 'fans', 'ever', 'book', 'hit', 'shelves', '2003', 'When', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'world', 'renowned', 'symbologist', 'brought', 'help', 'investigate', 'bizzare', 'murder', 'cryptographer', 'Sophie', 'Neveu', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'When', 'become', 'suspect', 'murder', 'quickly', 'gather', 'up', 'clues', 'crime', 'scene', 'try', 'escape', 'results', 'two', 'being', 'chased', 'first', 'police', 'then', 'assassins', 'employ', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'continue', 'uncover', 'conspiracy', 'Vatican', 'wishes', 'remain', 'mystery', 'film', 'moves', 'brisk', 'pace', 'twists', 'turns', 'abound', 'plenty', 'revelations', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'revel', 'However', 'movie', 'drag', 'due', 'Howard', 'urge', 'cram', 'bit', 'information', 'possible', 'massive', '149', 'minute', 'runtime', 'also', ""n't"", 'help', 'surprises', 'fun', 'are', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'characters', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'backstory', 'are', 'given', 'seem', 'nothing', 'more', 'vehicles', 'push', 'plot', 'forward', 'even', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'albino', 'monk', 'assassin', 'Silas', 'character', 'obvious', 'cinematic', 'potential', 'feels', 'sterile', 'weaknesses', 'can', 'result', 'scenes', 'feeling', 'little', 'flat', 'where', 'one', 'missing', 'elements', 'could', 'have', 'bolstered', 'such', 'moments', 'admirably', 'film', ""n't"", 'all', 'bad', 'negatives', 'unfortunately', 'weigh', 'almost', 'even', 'postives', 'Had', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'been', 'able', 'infuse', 'characters', 'humanity', 'few', 'scenes', 'been', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lean', 'exciting', 'thriller', 'fans', 'had', 'been', 'expecting']",N/A

The mockers and blasphemers are coming forward in great numbers, just as Jesus said they would, determined to recast the Son of God in deceptive New Age terms or to dismiss Him all-together. In doing so, they are paving the way for the Antichrist who will deceive the whole world into accepting him as the Messiah.The big bad beast does not make an appearance in Howard's film, but his coming is alluded to in the climax. The figure whom, it is suggested, is the only one worthy to possess the Holy Grail could be no one else. It certainly isn't the real Christ because the pursuit of some so-called Holy Grail is pure idolatry as warned against by God. Placing mystical value on any object, be it the chalice that Jesus sipped from during the Last Supper, or the spear that pierced His side during the crucifixion, or the Shroud of Turin, is Satanic in origin, emphasizing that which has been created rather than the Creator himself.As for DaVinci, it is well-known that he was a member of several secret societies, the likes of which still flourish today, to carry out the devil's plan to blind our eyes to the truth. Any ""codes"" in his work are in service to that lying devil of old and reveal nothing but his own corruption.On a purely cinematic level, ""The DaVinci Code"" is still a bust. This is third-rate Indiana Jones stuff, poorly made and indifferently acted. With the kinks in his hair ironed out, Tom Hanks looks like...well, I'll leave it to you to choose the private anatomical part he most resembles. The two-time Oscar winner's seemingly invulnerable career hit a bump in the road around the time of ""The Terminal."" His presence in a film based on a cheap pop culture phenomenon may have temporarily stalled his decline, but in the long run it may only accelerate it. Ian McKellon is so obnoxious here that I wanted to slap him.As for Ron Howard, he probably should have stayed in Mayberry. He wouldn't have gone on to a directing career or an Oscar, but as the Bible asks, ""What doth it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul?""Brian W.

639654,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00005JOC9,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[4, 9]","The Da Vinci Code as a novel is an international bestselling phenomenon, but The Da Vinci Code as a movie is bound to be long forgotten by year's end. Directed by Ron Howard, the Hollywood veteran behind such memorable films as A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man, this adaptation of Dan Brown's religious thriller is 149 minutes of monotonous exposition and tedious European spy thriller clich&eacute;s. What makes Dan Brown's novels so popular is the narrative background on such subjects as cryptography, secret societies, religious orders, and alternative history. But it's difficult to translate such ideas to the big screen, and it's here that The Da Vinci Code fails as a commercial thriller. Entire scenes are composed of lectures on the history of Christianity and the life of Leonardo Da Vinci. Michael Crichton has a similar style of writing that focuses on scientific breakthroughs and cutting-edge technology, but his novels adapt better to the big screen. Whereas Jurassic Park briefly lectured audiences on the inner-workings of DNA, then quickly jumped to two hours of dinosaurs terrorizing people, The Da Vinci Code keeps explaining, hypothesizing, and lecturing only to leave its audience hanging. The ideas are intriguing, but they make for a far better novel than silver screen blockbuster. Minus the interesting conjecture, the film is nothing more than a poorly written 1970s drugstore spy thriller...Tom Hanks plays the lead role of Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor of religious symbology lecturing in Paris. When Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle), curator of the Louvre, is found murdered and strangely positioned in his famous museum, local authorities initially consult Langdon for his expertise. But the professor soon learns from Sauniere's granddaughter, government cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), that he and the prime suspect are one and the same. Creating a diversion for the police, the two discover a hidden trail of clues created by Sauniere in the moments before his death, clues that just might lead them to most elusive treasure in human history - the Holy Grail. With InterPol hot on their trail, and the true murderer still at large, Langdon and Neveu enlist the help of Grail historian Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) to teach them the history of the Grail's protectors, The Priory of Scion, and to help them uncover the endless clues that promise to unravel a 2,000 year mystery...Despite the remarks of most critics, Tom Hanks' performance is not atrocious. Although his character is bland at best, he wasn't given much with which to work. Robert Langdon's lack of development is more attributable to poorly written dialogue and poor choices in direction. Ron Howard tries to cover up some of the excessive dialogue with visual images, but narrative is still narrative even with flashback sequences. Audrey Tautou delivers her lines well, but suffers from the same constraints as her Academy Award-winning screen partner. The only shining performance is provided by Ian McKellen as the eccentric and charming Grail expert, Leigh Teabing. Some of his one-liners add a bit of comic relief, but they're only band-aids on the gushing head wound that is this film.

639658,A3UYDJLYVS6GQX,B00005JOC9,"C. A. Lemley ""Cal""","[3, 6]","This is not a review about Dan Brown's book. I haven't read Mr. Brown's book; understand it's a work of fiction. This review is about the Movie and Subsequent Spinoffs of similar tag. Kudos to Mr. Brown's book for igniting such fluttering queries but shame on this Movie for its lackluster self! I expected more from Ron Howard and a few of the others. Historical data suggests Leonardo Da Vinci was a joker and multi-talented man (architect, engineering, philosophy and artist of various mediums including painting). It is said he painted to make a living. Oddly enough, at times he painted with dubious self-destructive mediums (to wit, painting the tour de force Lord's Supper with collective mediums known to cause decay). It is said Leonardo evidenced a bent towards procrastination and leaving things half done, to wit, leaving several of his paintings unfinished which may explain why it is said he toted the Mona Lisa* (* Mona Lisa was in fact a portrait of a rich lady commenced upon commission) around for years, possibly considering it unfinished. He is rumored to have associated with several icons of the day including the painter Botticelli, alchemist Isaac Newton and the writer Victor Hugo who wrote Les Miserables. It is rumored they were all members of the Priory of Sion which was said to be a 'secret' club purporting knowledge of certain  'information' regarding certain alleged relationships of Jesus. Leonardo was a fan of the alchemist arts, likely influenced by his alchemist buddy Isaac Newton. As such, it is logical to conclude Leonardo would incorporate symbolism into his work, however, it does not stand to reason that the works themselves by virtue of the symbols therein, collectively or separate, are doors to some heretofore reclusive truth, hidden secret, prophecy or revelation. Instead, it is more plausible Leonardo's symbolism stands for nothing more than the dazzle of firing neutrons pervading Leonardo's mind at the time of creation. Therefore, it seems plausible to suggest that if any of this symbolism is to be wooed and studied, assuming some vague merit in the same, perhaps it should be studied within the requisite historical, philosophical and aesthetic contexts for the infinite opaque combinations of hypotheticals they are and so they may  then be neatly whisked away as the bland chaff they are once the whet of curiosity drizzles and dies. Symbolism is a universal tool inherent to the race of man and a common device of many artists which serves to empower by virtue of the enigma therein, however to pronounce prophetic rights to that which is and shall forever remain forever a hypothetical is clearly a jump out of bounds. I am not disputing there are symbols integral to Leonardo's paintings. When I painted abstracts in college, I incorporated them too. I do dispute however that any such symbols are of any mattering consequence as they are in any event incapable of dismantling a faith in God that is fait accompli.As to the movie review: Farcical whodunit shoot barren of requisite synergy. First time I've seen Tom Hanks act poorly. In retrospect, everything was -sooo bad- that one might conjecture it was an intentional effort to in fact spoof the speculation, dampen the theory and shoo us away from the credible search; not to infer there is in fact a credible search, that the theory is correct or that the whole nine-yards isn't, in fact, a garrulous swamp of historical scraps sewn up for a buck- out of context. Summarily, I suppose the real conspiracy lies more in the bean-counted profit margins of this bash-appeal crap of a movie rather than anything else and that the true Holy Grail of this deal is really, well...BOX OFFICE REVENUE. What surprised me the most was that Tom Hanks consented to both the production and script.

He was an artist, inventor, and architect of unparalleled genius.While the novel (and now film) by Dan Brown titled ""The Da Vinci Code"" remains controversial due to it's subject matter, it is nevertheless an intelligent and entertaining piece of fiction (...or perhaps even nonfiction).This film explored the history of Christianity and the power of religion, as well as the importance and significance of symbolism in all walks of life.For those who read the book before they see the movie, you might notice that while the film is very well-made (I would expect nothing less from director Ron Howard) it does seem to have a problem with it's need for a large amount of exposition. It seemed to me that 70% of the film was straight exposition, or information/backstory that needed to be told in order for the events taking place to make sense. This was done mostly in interesting imagery, or flashbacks.Basically, the book had a little difficulty translating onto film mainly because there was just so much information and material to explain. In the book format, the story was told beautifully, seamlessly, and with the perfect amount of explanation at the right times. Each chapter of the book ended in a cliffhanger, which is part of what made the book so electrifying and hard to put down. The film felt rushed in the sense that the characters had to give the audience a lot of information in a compact period of time, and by doing this it came across much less seamlessly. It also didn't quite have that intense ""cliffhanger"" kind of feeling.However, I applaud this film and it's efforts to explore such difficult subject matter. Religion is a very touchy subject with many people, and its even *more* difficult to call religion and Christianity into question. People generally don't like their faith or religion questioned, and they certainly don't like being told that they may have been lied to about the truth of religiously significant events in the past.Regardless of your personal beliefs, this film is enjoyable and thrilling for the intriguing work of fiction that it is. You don't have to agree with the ideas that the film and book introduce. Think what you will, but try to view the film with an open mind.

They, along with the English and Dutch (research the Paper Wars against Spain in the 16th century) have been masters at the art of deception and propaganda for more than 500 years. Moreover, this film is nothing more than brainwashing and perpetuating the Black Legend and anti-Catholic sentiment in our country by stealth indoctrination carefully woven in mindless entertainment (an effective Zionist tool).The Black Legend against Spain is part of a vast movement started by the enemies of the Faith to destroy the Catholic religion. It is not an isolated case; other Catholic countries like Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Poland have had their reputations smeared for their adhesion to the Faith. The Black Legend seeks to throw discredit upon the Faith by building biases and prejudices against Catholicism. A current example of these attacks are Dan Brown's books ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels & Demons"", a malevolent cocktail of fake scholarship, lies and half-truths. It seeks to instill in Roman Catholics a sense of embarrassment and shame about the way in which their ancestors lived and practiced their faith. The effect is subtle but too often ends by Catholics then doubting the truth of the Faith.The Black Legend in England;: The development of anti-Spanish sentiment, 1558-1660 (Duke historical publications)Tree of Hate: Propaganda and Prejudices Affecting United States Relations with the Hispanic World",1,More anti-Catholic propaganda from Zionistwood (a.k.a.

It somewhere along the lines of, ""People rarely notice things right in front of their eyes.""The genius of DA VINCI CODE is that, that line is so very true. We have been blinded by repetitive images. Television. Politics. Religion. We don't question, we just live and assume. Not only is that true, but the movie proves it with unmistakable evidence that will throw you for a loop and have you questioning your very lives.Anyway, THE DA VINCI CODE is ultimately, fiction. Yet, more than any other fiction to date, blurs the line of fiction and reality successfully. Despite all the things that are suggested in the DA VINCI CODE that would turn traditional religion on its ear, the movie pleads its case with great visuals, history, symbols, hidden meanings and unmistakable question marks hidden in real paintings by Leonardo Da Vinci.How many times have we've seen DaVinci's THE LAST SUPPER? Hundreds? Thousands? Yet, we are blind to the unmistakable questions that the movie poses about the painting. Sure, DaVinci obviously wasn't there at the time of the Last Supper, but it's still fun thinking about the questions his painting poses.THE DA VINCI CODE continues to pour on the evidence as the movie goes forward, leaving a lasting impression on your mind and your grasp of the stories we may or may not have been forced to believe throughout our lives. If anything, THE DA VINCI CODE, all be it fiction, stimulates the brain and makes you want to know more about Jesus Christ, Leonardo DaVinci and Mary Magdalene. That may be its greatest asset.After watching DA VINCI CODE, I find it hard to believe that there were so many bad reviews. Either they are people who are really really jaded and watch too many movies, or their religious types who are offended by the movies potential implications.The way I see it, God gave us brains so that we could walk, talk, think and help each other. He gave us rational thought so that we could decipher for ourselves what is right and wrong and not to just believe because we were told to.Ultimately, it's just a movie, and a darn good one.",4,CANDY for the MIND,1163548800,"11 15, 2006",2006,2460,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'m"", 'catholic', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'really', 'had', 'preconceived', 'notion', 'THE', 'DA', 'VINCI', 'CODE', 'going', 'other', 'fact', 'lots', 'people', 'were', 'talking', 'more', 'less', 'catholic', 'one', 'line', 'DA', 'VINCI', 'CODE', 'movie', 'one', 'sentence', 'better', 'anybody', 'can', 'review', 'somewhere', 'lines', 'People', 'rarely', 'notice', 'things', 'right', 'front', 'eyes', 'genius', 'DA', 'VINCI', 'CODE', 'line', 'so', 'very', 'true', 'have', 'been', 'blinded', 'repetitive', 'images', 'Television', 'Politics', 'Religion', 'do', ""n't"", 'question', 'just', 'live', 'assume', 'Not', 'only', 'true', 'movie', 'unmistakable', 'evidence', 'will', 'throw', 'loop', 'have', 'questioning', 'very', 'lives.Anyway', 'THE', 'DA', 'VINCI', 'CODE', 'ultimately', 'fiction', 'more', 'other', 'fiction', 'date', 'line', 'fiction', 'reality', 'successfully', 'things', 'are', 'suggested', 'DA', 'VINCI', 'CODE', 'would', 'turn', 'traditional', 'religion', 'ear', 'movie', 'case', 'great', 'visuals', 'history', 'symbols', 'hidden', 'meanings', 'unmistakable', 'question', 'marks', 'hidden', 'real', 'paintings', 'Leonardo', 'Da', 'Vinci.How', 'many', 'times', 'have', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'DaVinci', 'THE', 'LAST', 'SUPPER', 'Hundreds', 'Thousands', 'Yet', 'are', 'blind', 'unmistakable', 'questions', 'movie', 'painting', 'Sure', 'DaVinci', 'obviously', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'time', 'Last', 'Supper', 'still', 'fun', 'thinking', 'questions', 'painting', 'poses.THE', 'DA', 'VINCI', 'CODE', 'pour', 'evidence', 'movie', 'forward', 'leaving', 'lasting', 'impression', 'mind', 'grasp', 'stories', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'forced', 'believe', 'lives', 'anything', 'THE', 'DA', 'VINCI', 'CODE', 'all', 'be', 'fiction', 'brain', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Leonardo', 'DaVinci', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'may', 'be', 'greatest', 'asset.After', 'watching', 'DA', 'VINCI', 'CODE', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'reviews', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'really', 'jaded', 'watch', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'religious', 'types', 'who', 'are', 'offended', 'movies', 'potential', 'implications.The', 'way', 'see', 'God', 'gave', 'so', 'could', 'walk', 'talk', 'think', 'help', 'other', 'gave', 'rational', 'thought', 'so', 'could', 'decipher', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'not', 'just', 'believe', 'were', 'told', 'to.Ultimately', 'just', 'movie', 'darn', 'good', 'one']",N/A

It's your typical Hollywood action-thriller in most respects. Yes, it's silly and unrealistic. But if that's all there were to it I might go along with the ""it's only a movie"" argument.Unfortunately, this movie is also full of ideas, ridiculous ideas that run counter to the historical facts. As an atheist, I certainly have no problem that the movie brings up some of the darker moments in Christian history. For example, the Inquisition, the witch burnings and the Crusades are all mentioned. Yet these actual historical events are only brushed over. Instead the movie focuses on making up some bizarre conspiracy theory that the Catholic Church is involved in a grand cover-up to prevent the public from knowing the truth about Christianity. For example, it states that not only were Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had children but that their bloodline has continued to the present day. They also portray a secret Catholic society that is involved in murder plots, strange sexual rituals and all manner of evil activities. It's completely fair to challenge the Church on its grave errors. For example, the shameful Inquisition involved the murder and tortue of many innocent people. I also disagree with the Vatican's present opposition to legal abortion and birth control. However, the sort of ridiculous conspiracy theory that this movie suggests is the worst sort of anti-Catholic bigotry. It's also dangerous to society as a whole as demonstrated by how similar lies and falsehoods have been historically used against Jews to justify brutal acts of anti-Semitism, including the Holocaust. No, I don't think it's likely that the ""Da Vinci Code"" will lead to the mass execution of Catholics. But any time a particular group is scapegoated it's a potential source of trouble.Basically, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a bunch of mumbo jumbo, distorted information and flat out lies that are not supported by the evidence. But, unfortunately, as P.T. Barnum said, ""there's a sucker born every minute,"" and some people are going to believe this nonsense. History is a complex subject and I have no respect for people, whether they be the book's writer, Dan Brown, or the film's director, Ron Howard, who play fast and loose with the truth in order to make a buck.

639673,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JOC9,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 3]","Was there ever a doubt in anyone's mind that ""The Da Vinci Code"" would wind up on the big screen? Dan Brown's novel of religious mystery and intrigue has remained such a literary phenomenon that a film adaptation had to have been ready right from the word go. Ron Howard should thank his lucky stars that he was offered the role of director; anyone who understands just how big a story this is would have killed for the opportunity he was given. The ones who turned the project down will probably forever kick themselves in sheer frustration, proof that you should never pass up a golden opportunity. I suppose there is a down side; in taking the job, Howard made himself vulnerable to the outrage of the religious community, specifically the Catholic Church. They've certainly been vocal in their hatred of this story, both as a novel and as a film.But at the same time, there are multitudes that support the efforts made by Brown and Howard. And now, they have this film to show for it. Obviously, it's not a perfect adaptation of the novel: several details regarding location, time, and discoveries were either condensed or altogether removed, most likely for the sake of keeping the film going at a reasonable pace. Fortunately, they're all minor changes, ones that don't in any way harm the intention or integrity of the story. Besides, we all know that film is a medium that requires story omissions and alterations when using a written piece as source material. It just comes with the territory. The trick is to remove or alter the right details, the ones that aren't crucial to the plot. The film succeeds in removing all that was unnecessary (someone must have kept a close eye on this during production).The plot: Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a Harvard Symbology professor visiting Paris to give a lecture on pagan symbolism. During a book signing, he's called upon by Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) to aid investigation of a murder in the Louvre museum. The body of Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle), the museum's curator, lies in a particularly strange position, almost as if it were posing like a figure in one of Leonardo Da Vinci's sketches. But even stranger is the fact that Sauniere positioned himself that way before he died, as if he were trying to give a message to someone....Langdon's expertise on symbolism and the use of a museum-quality ultraviolet light reveal some pretty startling details, ones that set into motion a cross-country scavenger hunt. It also sets into motion a series of murders, accusations, and lies that point directly to Langdon, making him the most wanted man in all of France. But he's not alone; at his side is Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), a cunning cryptographer and granddaughter to the murdered Sauniere. Even though she hasn't spoken to her grandfather in ten years (due to her witnessing him engaging in an especially uncommon ritual), she knows that he was trying to tell her something, even in death. She also knows that he trusted Langdon for some reason (even though the two never met), and because of that, she's willing to help Langdon escape. But things get complicated when it's learned that Sauinere was part of a secret society, one whose history revolves around one of the most famous religious icons ever: the Holy Grail.They travel from one location to the other as they follow Sauniere's clues, obscure pieces of information crafted through cryptology. One clue leads them to a Swiss bank where they retrieve a very important object from its vaults, a kind of treasure box created by Sauinere from the sketches of Da Vinci himself. It's made up of a row of discs, each acting as a lock and containing letters of the alphabet. The only way it can be opened is by rotating the discs and spelling out a specific password. Any attempt to break open the device will result in the destruction of its inner contents, thanks to a simple but effective method of security. If Langdon and Sophie wish to safely open this keystone, they need the help of someone who's dedicated his life to the study of the Holy Grail. Here enters Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen), a wealthy, colorful British man whose knowledge of the Grail is beyond plentiful.But there's another side to this story, one that involves an ultra-conservative sect of Catholicism called the Opus Dei. The most prominent character associated with this group is Silas (Paul Bettany), an albino monk who takes his faith a little too seriously, believing he needs to be in constant pain in order to remind himself of Christ's suffering (he regularly whips his back with a cat o'nine tails and continuously wears a belt of sharp metal around his thigh). He's been given a mission from a mysterious, hidden figure called The Teacher: get the keystone away from Langdon and Sophie. It contains a powerful secret that they don't want revealed, something that could easily shake the very foundation of the Church as the world knows it. If they have to kill those who stand in the way of their goal, then so be it. Called in to help with this task is Bishop Aringarosa (Alfred Molina), a man whose belief in the traditions of the Catholic Church has made him greedy.It's this very portrayal of the Church that has a lot of people up in arms. To a degree, I understand the resistance; faith is a sacred, personal thing, and any negative representation will be met with hostility. But the naysayers need to realize that ""The Da Vinci Code"" is nothing more than a non-threatening work of fiction, having very little basis in reality (other than some names and dates). I wish they would understand that; only then will they finally see it in an entirely different light. Both the novel and the movie were so meticulously crafted, so finely and carefully structured, that it doesn't allow itself to be overlooked. That's because this is a puzzle story, basic yet incredibly clever in the way it presents an incomplete picture whose pieces fall into place as it progresses. That's probably one of the reasons why the story is so popular, and it'll most likely be the reason why this movie succeeds: everyone loves a good mystery.",5,Dan Brown's Blockbuster Novel Hits the

639676,A256F7E787F5SG,B00005JOC9,Christopher Nieman,"[10, 16]","I'm seemingly one of the only people in the world who has not read Dan Brown's phenomenally best-selling novel THE DA VINCI CODE. So, leading up to the movie's release, I was in the unique position of having no vested interests, no pre-conceived notions, and no biases carried over from reading the novel. I enjoyed that opportunity, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with that fresh point of view.Judging THE DA VINCI CODE purely for its cinematic elements, I found it a convoluted potboiler -- just one scrape after another, with a string of twists thrown in for good measure. In its entirety, the film feels compressed to fit into a limited timeframe. Scenes brush by very quickly, covering lots of ground in a thumbnail form, trying to cram a lot of exposition into numerous, lecturey scenes that swerve dangerously close to narration. Lead actors Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou don't seem very free to move around in their characters' skins, so their performances appear stiff and unnatural.The film is obviously trying to satisfy fans of the novel in less than three hours. But for those of us who haven't read the book, we're kind of left out of part of the secret. The plotting cuts a lot of corners, and I found it difficult to follow all of its serpentine details and relationships. The religious conspiracies left me curious but not engrossed. Most of the puzzle-solving scenes fell pretty flat because there was no time to sweat them out. Other scenes, such as our heroes' numerous and implausible brushes with death, play flat because that's just what they are.The movie officially lost me when Jurgen Prochnow's Swiss-banker character announces, just as the cops show up to scoop up Hanks and Tautou, that for certain high-ranking account holders, there's a special ""safe-passage"" clause in their contracts, allowing fugitives a Get Out Of Jail Free card. I had to stifle my laughter at that little gem.Later, the villainous Silas (who seems like he fell out of a Thomas Harris novel) is about to kill our heroes, only to be foiled in the nick of time by a flock of birds -- a scene somehow played ridiculously straight on film.Probably the most effective scene of the movie is when Ian McKellen's character Leigh Teabing gives a background on the mysteries of Leonardo da Vinci's painting ""The Last Supper."" Whatever the book's description is, it simply can't match the visual aspect the movie version provides.I will also share that I consider myself ""religiously neutral,"" which is to say that, along with having no biases from reading the novel, I also carried no religiously-based biases into this film. And not surprisingly, I left the theater unaffected by the movie's religious controversies. You bring out what you bring in, as they say.I found THE DA VINCI CODE okay, but not anything I would look forward to seeing again, maybe ever. I may still read the book, though, if only because it should be an improvement over the movie. I still want to understand the phenomenon of the book, but unfortunately the movie wasn't the answer I was looking for.",2,A pedestrian film trying to preach to the converted,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,3077,"[""'m"", 'seemingly', 'one', 'only', 'people', 'world', 'who', 'not', 'read', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'phenomenally', 'best-selling', 'THE', 'DA', 'VINCI', 'CODE', 'So', 'leading', 'up', 'movie', 'release', 'was', 'unique', 'position', 'having', 'vested', 'interests', 'pre-conceived', 'notions', 'biases', 'carried', 'reading', 'novel', 'enjoyed', 'opportunity', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie', 'fresh', 'point', 'view.Judging', 'THE', 'DA', 'VINCI', 'CODE', 'purely', 'cinematic', 'elements', 'found', 'convoluted', 'potboiler', 'just', 'one', 'scrape', 'string', 'twists', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'entirety', 'film', 'feels', 'compressed', 'fit', 'limited', 'timeframe', 'Scenes', 'brush', 'very', 'quickly', 'covering', 'lots', 'ground', 'thumbnail', 'form', 'trying', 'cram', 'lot', 'exposition', 'numerous', 'lecturey', 'scenes', 'swerve', 'dangerously', 'close', 'narration', 'Lead', 'actors', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'free', 'move', 'around', 'characters', 'skins', 'performances', 'appear', 'stiff', 'unnatural.The', 'film', 'obviously', 'trying', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'novel', 'less', 'three', 'hours', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'re"", 'kind', 'left', 'part', 'secret', 'plotting', 'lot', 'corners', 'found', 'difficult', 'follow', 'serpentine', 'details', 'relationships', 'religious', 'conspiracies', 'left', 'curious', 'not', 'engrossed', 'Most', 'puzzle-solving', 'scenes', 'fell', 'pretty', 'flat', 'was', 'time', 'sweat', 'out', 'Other', 'scenes', 'such', 'heroes', 'numerous', 'implausible', 'brushes', 'death', 'play', 'flat', 'just', 'what', 'are.The', 'movie', 'officially', 'lost', 'when', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'Swiss-banker', 'character', 'announces', 'just', 'cops', 'show', 'up', 'scoop', 'up', 'Hanks', 'Tautou', 'certain', 'high-ranking', 'account', 'holders', 'special', 'safe-passage', 'clause', 'contracts', 'allowing', 'fugitives', 'Get', 'Out', 'Jail', 'Free', 'card', 'had', 'stifle', 'laughter', 'little', 'gem.Later', 'villainous', 'Silas', 'who', 'fell', 'out', 'Thomas', 'Harris', 'novel', 'kill', 'heroes', 'only', 'be', 'foiled', 'nick', 'time', 'flock', 'birds', 'scene', 'somehow', 'played', 'ridiculously', 'straight', 'film.Probably', 'most', 'effective', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'character', 'Leigh', 'Teabing', 'background', 'mysteries', 'Leonardo', 'da', 'Vinci', 'painting', 'Last', 'Supper', 'book', 'description', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'match', 'visual', 'aspect', 'movie', 'version', 'provides.I', 'will', 'also', 'share', 'consider', 'religiously', 'neutral', 'say', 'having', 'biases', 'reading', 'novel', 'also', 'carried', 'religiously-based', 'biases', 'film', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'left', 'theater', 'unaffected', 'movie', 'religious', 'controversies', 'bring', 'out', 'what', 'bring', 'say.I', 'found', 'THE', 'DA', 'VINCI', 'CODE', 'okay', 'not', 'anything', 'would', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'again', 'maybe', 'ever', 'may', 'still', 'read', 'book', 'though', 'only', 'should', 'be', 'improvement', 'movie', 'still', 'want', 'understand', 'phenomenon', 'book', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'answer', 'was', 'looking']",N/A

639680,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JOC9,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 4]","The Da Vinci Code, written by Dan Brown, was one of those books that became a blockbuster but partly for the wrong reasons. While it was indeed a good read, the main selling point was its tackling of religious issues, especially dealing with the legend of the Holy Grail and what it actually is. Naturally a film version was in order and who do we get to adapt this mega-hit? None other than Ron Howard, director of Backdraft, Apollo 13 and a Beautiful Mind, with the film being adapted by Akiva Goldsman(ugh). Is it as bad as the critics said it was? Not quite but it's definately a massively missed opportunity.Robert Langdon, a symbologist and professor is called into to oversee a body murdered in the Louvre: a naked old man who mutilated a pentagram onto himself and left some clues. Of course, the police believe he's guilty of it so he has to team up with crytologist Sophie Neveu to solve the riddle of one of the most well-guarded secrets(well, in fantasy land anyway) in history. Chasing them is Silas, an albino monk prone to self-flagellation, a corrupt Bishop and an elusive character known as the Teacher.Having conversations with a friend of mine is always a minefield because she hates swearing and sometimes I tend to become a sailor. In many ways that's exactly how people reacted to this film: overdoing it. It's a book, it's not an expose piece a la CNN debunking an entire religion, it's fiction, same way an author might talk of an apocalyptic world despite the fact we still have airplanes and malls and ice cream parlors. That's your basic mindset upon first reading the book: don't believe everything. With the movie? Same thing but don't think you're going to watch a great movie. In fact that's where the film drops the ball: what should've been a great entertaining film is merely a serviceable adaptation but missing key things. For one: the film's just not exciting. I literally finished the book in one night cause it was so engrossing. Here, it's like once is enough. Second: the film feels rushed as if you can easily digest all the massive amounts of exposition on the go. That's why the book worked: I can re-read all the sections about Christian history: here's it's just whoosh!How's the casting? Ironically, I couldn't think of anyone else(besides Hugh Jackman maybe) to play Robert Langdon than Tom Hanks but he almost sleepwalks at times though it's probably not his fault. Knowing he had a blockbuster on his hands, Howard probably just rushed through his takes. And what better actress(and adorable one too) to play Sophie than Audrey Tautou of Amelie fame? Then of course there's scene-stealer Ian McKellan and creepy Paul Bettany as Leigh Teabing and Silas respectively. But as I said, some of it seems very first-take stuff. What helps the film is the added visuals to help with the clue solving. Letters appear brightened, flashbacks are used and in my favorite segment, a computer teaching tool is used for the Last Supper. It makes the film very similar to National Treasure and regardless of your feelings on the plot, this kind of stuff is always fascinating.How's the special features? It felt very studio-sanctioned stuff. This, along with the Matrix, can play host to numerous commentaries from Director and Cast and Crew to Dan Brown himself to even scholars to debunk Brown's conclusions or even support theories.

639683,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,B00005JOC9,"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado""","[4, 6]","Well, I saw the film on Friday and although I haven't read the book, I certainly enjoyed the film. I read about all the critics who are hating this movie and much of the audience laughing at the movie during its premiere at Cannes, which after seeing the film sounds to me like the biggest professional critics of this film are guilty of elitism and narrowmindedness. Is the film a masterpiece, no, but it's still a good film.The acting is decent, and I honestly think many people misinterpreted Hanks' portrayal of Langdon. The professor is a serious scientist of symbology, who also happens to be claustrophobic, and he seems like an introvert who doesn't like much attention, which for those who might not know sounds quite a bit like Dan Brown, the author, so perhaps he loosely based the protagonist on himself. Anyway, if one looks at his portrayal through that light, it makes more sense of why his acting was perceived as stiff or ""wooden"". Audrey Tautou was charming as cryptologist Sophie Neveu, Jean Reno never disappoints as he was the police detective Captain Fache in charge of tracking down Robert and Sophie, and Alfred Molina was believable as Bishop Aringarosa, part of the Opus Dei, a secret shadow council of the Catholic Church. Jurgen Prochnov had a small part as a banker but he's always a great addition to any film. Ian McKellan is the best actor in this film, who plays Sir Leigh Teabing, an old friend of Langdon not to mention a brilliant historian.  Ian does an excellent job of carving out the old, somewhat crippled but highly capable expert on religion and history.I loved the cinematography as it flowed effortlessly from scene to scene, and there were some excellent shots of mansions, churches, the L'ouvre and other beautiful architecture.The score by Hans Zimmer was top notch as usual and really helped set the mood for the various acts, making certain parts seem very intense and other times mystical.Ron Howard the director is one of the finest film makers of our time, and he does a wonderful job with bringing this book to life, as far as I can tell without having read it. What I like about Howard and respect him for is his uncanny ability to understand, conceptualize and ultimately visualize through film a certain idea or character. He succeeds in adding intrigue and the air of mystery that this type of thriller calls for. I don't blame Howard for being upset over the largely negative reaction to this wonderful film that he has crafted.The controversy surrounding this film is undeserved because it is fictional and is meant primarily as entertainment, and perhaps a small part of it is to challenge people to think a little bit about their faith, about what role the Church plays and how the ordinary person fits into the grand scheme of Christianity and its dogma.  Any film that gets the average viewer to think seriously about these important concepts, or any concept for that matter, has achieved far more than the typical Hollywood film, and that alone makes this film worthy of a few hours of consideration.  To reiterate, the film will not become a classic for the ages, but it's still an engaging, thrilling and beautifully shot film that achieves its purpose of realizing the silver screen adaption of what must be a fairly intricate and complex book, despite the supposed lack of literary finesse according to numerous compensated book and film critics.I certainly got my money's worth.  I was entertained for two and a half hours, and it's one of the few films that left me thinking about the movie afterwards, of the possibilities behind Christianity's teachings and its dogma.  Not all of it is fiction, after all, although the priory of Sion being the exception since it was invented by an infamous French forger by the name of Plantard in the 1960s, but there's definitely some food for thought. If anyone has the slightest inclination to see it in the theater, don't hesitate since it's one of the best films so far this year.",4,'The Da Vinci Code' Is A Mystery Worth Solving On the Silver Screen,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,3994,"['Well', 'saw', 'film', 'Friday', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'read', 'critics', 'who', 'are', 'hating', 'movie', 'much', 'audience', 'laughing', 'movie', 'premiere', 'Cannes', 'seeing', 'film', 'biggest', 'professional', 'critics', 'film', 'are', 'guilty', 'elitism', 'narrowmindedness', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'still', 'good', 'film.The', 'acting', 'decent', 'honestly', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'misinterpreted', 'Hanks', 'portrayal', 'Langdon', 'professor', 'serious', 'scientist', 'symbology', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'claustrophobic', 'introvert', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'attention', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'know', 'quite', 'bit', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'author', 'so', 'perhaps', 'loosely', 'based', 'protagonist', 'Anyway', 'one', 'portrayal', 'light', 'more', 'sense', 'why', 'acting', 'was', 'perceived', 'stiff', 'wooden', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'was', 'charming', 'cryptologist', 'Sophie', 'Neveu', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'never', 'was', 'police', 'detective', 'Captain', 'Fache', 'charge', 'tracking', 'down', 'Robert', 'Sophie', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'was', 'believable', 'Bishop', 'Aringarosa', 'part', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'secret', 'shadow', 'council', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnov', 'had', 'small', 'part', 'banker', 'always', 'great', 'addition', 'film', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'best', 'actor', 'film', 'who', 'Sir', 'Leigh', 'Teabing', 'old', 'friend', 'Langdon', 'not', 'mention', 'brilliant', 'historian', 'Ian', 'excellent', 'job', 'carving', 'out', 'old', 'somewhat', 'crippled', 'highly', 'capable', 'expert', 'religion', 'history.I', 'loved', 'cinematography', 'flowed', 'effortlessly', 'scene', 'scene', 'were', 'excellent', 'shots', 'mansions', 'churches', ""L'ouvre"", 'other', 'beautiful', 'architecture.The', 'score', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'usual', 'really', 'helped', 'set', 'mood', 'various', 'acts', 'making', 'certain', 'parts', 'seem', 'very', 'intense', 'other', 'times', 'mystical.Ron', 'Howard', 'director', 'one', 'finest', 'film', 'makers', 'time', 'wonderful', 'job', 'bringing', 'book', 'life', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'having', 'read', 'What', 'like', 'Howard', 'respect', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'understand', 'conceptualize', 'ultimately', 'visualize', 'film', 'certain', 'idea', 'character', 'adding', 'intrigue', 'air', 'mystery', 'type', 'thriller', 'calls', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Howard', 'being', 'upset', 'largely', 'negative', 'reaction', 'wonderful', 'film', 'crafted.The', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'film', 'undeserved', 'fictional', 'meant', 'primarily', 'entertainment', 'perhaps', 'small', 'part', 'challenge', 'people', 'think', 'little', 'bit', 'faith', 'what', 'role', 'Church', 'plays', 'how', 'ordinary', 'person', 'grand', 'scheme', 'Christianity', 'dogma', 'Any', 'film', 'average', 'viewer', 'think', 'seriously', 'important', 'concepts', 'concept', 'matter', 'achieved', 'far', 'more', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'alone', 'film', 'worthy', 'few', 'hours', 'consideration', 'reiterate', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'become', 'classic', 'ages', 'still', 'engaging', 'thrilling', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'film', 'purpose', 'realizing', 'silver', 'screen', 'adaption', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'fairly', 'intricate', 'complex', 'book', 'supposed', 'lack', 'literary', 'finesse', 'according', 'numerous', 'compensated', 'book', 'film', 'critics.I', 'certainly', 'got', 'money', 'worth', 'was', 'entertained', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'left', 'thinking', 'movie', 'afterwards', 'possibilities', 'Christianity', 'teachings', 'dogma', 'Not', 'fiction', 'priory', 'Sion', 'being', 'exception', 'was', 'invented', 'infamous', 'French', 'forger', 'name', 'Plantard', '1960s', 'definitely', 'food', 'thought', 'anyone', 'slightest', 'inclination', 'see', 'theater', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'so', 'far', 'year']",N/A

If anything, Christianity (and frankly, all other of the world's mainstream religions) will probably emasculate or destroy themselves in due time as more and more people realize that mortal men, not some 'pie in the sky deity', conceived of and wrote ALL 'holy' religious books, tomes, and manuscripts in all of human history (and as more and more people humbly and logically admit to being agnostics or atheists). Besides, this film was not a documentary (as some shockingly seem to think), but it did make you think about the origins and validity of incipient Christianity, and some of it's claims (that Jesus is 'the son of God', for example).  In any case, this has been the 'age old question' for many honest, thinking Christians.  I see no controversy in this, being that it is healthy, and part of being human to question things.  My only critique was that the film was definitely too long and plodding, and should have been condensed to just under 2 hours.  Otherwise, it was riveting and nicely paced throughout.

He takes an extreme form of Christianity, flogging himself and even wearing a spiked discipline belt (cilice) around his leg.While comparisons have been made to Raiders of the Lost Ark (the quest for the Holy Grail), the DaVinci Code is more a thinking movie given the codes Langdon and Sophie have to decipher, and the wily intellect of Jacques Sauniere is demonstrated time and time again with each clue solved, be it through anagrams, codes, or Fibonacci numbers.  Langdon and Neveu follow clue after clue, from the Louvre, to a Swiss bank account, to the Templar's church in England.  They also get help from Sir Leigh Teabing, an eccentric British Grail historian whose passionate and enthused performance by Ian McKellen makes for one of the greatest moments in the movie.  It's gratifying to see heroes and characters whose chief assets are their brains, not whether they can kick a 50 ft steel wall down and kickbox their way through 50 bad guys dressed in black in a digital blur.Tom Hanks does a competent job as Langdon, though check out that hairdo!  I was initially disgruntled upon hearing Audrey Tautou (Sophie) costarring.  She's finally sold out, I thought, but after seeing her competent and likeable character plus a glimpse of that smile I remember from Amelie, much of my rancor evaporated.  And since going Hollywood, poor Jean Reno (Fache) seems relegated to second banana roles as the token French official--remember The Pink Panther.The controversy that set the Vatican abuzz is nothing new--q.v. The Last Temptation of Christ, which somewhat dwells on the same theme.  But it does make a point of how history and thus truth is a commodity created by the winners, at the cost of keeping the real truth hidden from the rest of the world, often innocent lives.  The historical flashbacks demonstrating the holocaust perpetuated against freethinking women burned as witches and the hunting down of the Templars by the Church exemplify that.  In Langdon's lecture, we see how Poseidon's trident is turned into the devil's pitchfork and how Mary nursing Jesus was taken from a representation of Isis nursing Horus, basically how Christianity was founded on distortions, appropriations, and suppressing concepts from pagan religion--we have Emperor Constantine to thank for that at the Council of Nicaea.  So dark the con of man indeed.Being a somewhat harsh judge when it comes to movies based on novels, there was quite a bit of material excised from the movie, but 85% of the book was there, so given today's shoddy standards, not bad.  Granted, there are some extraneous stuff in the movie not in the book--the scene at the park where Sophie pays 50 euros to the drug addict to have the park bench to herself and Langdon.  The book's better, obviously, but as movie adaptations go, a hand to director Ron Howard.",5,So dark the con of man...so not bad a movie adaptation,1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,4081,"['could', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'DaVinci', 'Code', 'even', 'when', 'Japan', 'paperback', 'edition', 'were', 'display', 'bookstores', 'everywhere', 'were', 'posters', 'movies', 'pillars', 'Tokyo', 'subway', 'station', 'returning', 'home', 'forced', 'read', 'book', 'taking', 'gander', 'movie.For', 'sheltered', 'realms', 'pop', 'culture', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'idea', 'giving', 'lecture', 'symbols', 'Paris', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'professor', 'enlisted', 'aiding', 'police', 'murder', 'Jacques', 'Sauniere', 'curator', 'Louvre', 'who', 'been', 'found', 'la', 'DaVinci', 'Vitruvian', 'Man', 'Canon', 'Proportions', 'Sauniere', 'also', 'wrote', 'cryptic', 'message', 'Bezu', 'Fache', 'DCPJ', 'Direction', 'Centrale', 'Police', 'Judiciare', 'officer', 'charge', 'investigation', 'Langdon', 'find', 'out', 'Langdon', 'ally', 'DCPJ', 'cryptologist', 'Sophie', 'Neveu', 'granddaughter', 'murdered', 'whom', 'not', 'been', 'contact', 'long', 'time', 'duo', 'are', 'run', 'Fache', 'already', 'pegged', 'Langdon', 'murder', 'suspect', 'party', 'form', 'menacing', 'albino', 'monk', 'Silas', 'guidance', 'Bishop', 'Aringarosa', 'extreme', 'Catholic', 'organization', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'mysterious', 'person', 'known', 'Teacher', 'also', 'heroes', 'extreme', 'form', 'Christianity', 'flogging', 'even', 'wearing', 'spiked', 'discipline', 'belt', 'cilice', 'leg.While', 'comparisons', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'quest', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'DaVinci', 'Code', 'more', 'thinking', 'movie', 'given', 'codes', 'Langdon', 'Sophie', 'have', 'decipher', 'wily', 'intellect', 'Jacques', 'Sauniere', 'demonstrated', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'clue', 'solved', 'be', 'anagrams', 'codes', 'Fibonacci', 'numbers', 'Langdon', 'Neveu', 'follow', 'clue', 'clue', 'Louvre', 'Swiss', 'bank', 'account', 'Templar', 'church', 'England', 'also', 'get', 'help', 'Sir', 'Leigh', 'Teabing', 'eccentric', 'British', 'Grail', 'historian', 'passionate', 'enthused', 'performance', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'one', 'greatest', 'moments', 'movie', 'gratifying', 'see', 'heroes', 'characters', 'chief', 'assets', 'are', 'brains', 'not', 'can', 'kick', '50', 'ft', 'steel', 'wall', 'down', 'kickbox', 'way', '50', 'bad', 'guys', 'dressed', 'black', 'digital', 'blur.Tom', 'Hanks', 'competent', 'job', 'Langdon', 'though', 'check', 'out', 'hairdo', 'was', 'initially', 'disgruntled', 'hearing', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'Sophie', 'costarring', 'finally', 'sold', 'out', 'thought', 'seeing', 'competent', 'likeable', 'character', 'glimpse', 'smile', 'remember', 'Amelie', 'much', 'rancor', 'evaporated', 'going', 'Hollywood', 'poor', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Fache', 'relegated', 'second', 'banana', 'roles', 'token', 'French', 'official', 'remember', 'Pink', 'Panther.The', 'controversy', 'set', 'Vatican', 'abuzz', 'nothing', 'new', 'q.v', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Christ', 'somewhat', 'same', 'theme', 'make', 'point', 'how', 'history', 'thus', 'truth', 'commodity', 'created', 'winners', 'cost', 'keeping', 'real', 'truth', 'hidden', 'rest', 'world', 'often', 'innocent', 'lives', 'historical', 'flashbacks', 'demonstrating', 'holocaust', 'perpetuated', 'freethinking', 'women', 'burned', 'witches', 'hunting', 'Templars', 'Church', 'exemplify', 'Langdon', 'lecture', 'see', 'how', 'Poseidon', 'trident', 'turned', 'devil', 'pitchfork', 'how', 'Mary', 'nursing', 'Jesus', 'was', 'taken', 'representation', 'Isis', 'nursing', 'Horus', 'basically', 'how', 'Christianity', 'was', 'founded', 'distortions', 'appropriations', 'suppressing', 'concepts', 'pagan', 'religion', 'have', 'Emperor', 'Constantine', 'thank', 'Council', 'Nicaea', 'So', 'dark', 'con', 'man', 'indeed.Being', 'somewhat', 'harsh', 'judge', 'when', 'movies', 'based', 'novels', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'material', 'excised', 'movie', '85', '%', 'book', 'was', 'there', 'given', 'today', 'shoddy', 'standards', 'not', 'bad', 'Granted', 'are', 'extraneous', 'stuff', 'movie', 'not', 'book', 'scene', 'park', 'where', 'Sophie', '50', 'euros', 'drug', 'addict', 'have', 'park', 'bench', 'herself', 'Langdon', 'book', 'better', 'obviously', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'go', 'hand', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard']",N/A

The ""extras"" reflect the film.  They seem ""tacked on"" to make a quick buck.  That sums up the movie, too.  The casting in the film is bad.  The acting is excellent but these folks are way, way miscast.  But that's not really the problem.  The problem is that they ""shot the book.""  They just filmed some actors reading the book.  Fast.  This approach left us with a bit of a mess, and a big embarrassment to a lot of skilled and talented people who have had the bad luck to be associated with this film.Actually, if the actors had just read the book on an empty stage, it would have been a better movie.  The ""action"" is distracting.  It doesn't make you sit on the edge of your seat, it makes you want to go get a snack.  Nothing works as it should, because they shot the book.What was required here was the courage to do something else.  Writers notoriously resist any attempt to alter their work when it's made into a film.  Well, Dan Brown should have encouraged it.  I could write the bones of better script right here.  And I will.The first act introduces a ship-load of weirdos.  So let's explore that.  Langdon is a professor.  That's weird right there. Did he kill the curator like the French police think he did?  Maybe.  He's a weirdo.  Maybe they had a dispute over the number of apostrophes in alphabet soup.  What about this strange woman who shows up and butts in?  She must be insane.  She ought to act a little more insane.  The French police are trying to arrest a killer but this loony woman helps him get away, and displays uncanny driving ability doing so.We learn that Langdon is just weird. He's not a killer.  The strange woman is not crazy.  She had an unusual upbringing.  Think James Bond meets James Beard.  Incidentally--there was some hocus pocus about DaVinci paintings that Langdon...""...figured out while you were in there...""""In where?""""Th-th-there.""""WHERE?""""Th-the ladies room...""""You mean the men's room?""""Th-th-th-th-the""""Never mind.""Oh yeah, give Langdon a stutter.  A severe one.Now we're on our way.  The scene where our albino friend whups himself is silly, offensive and dumb all at the same time.  Take it from me, cowboy, if you whip yourself regularly, you won't feel it much.  Sorta like shaving.  All that wincing and prancing just looked fake, not real.  Hate to say it but Ron Howard really HAS led a pain-free life.  Who'd a-thunk?Now, I can't write a whole synopsis here, but this film would have benefitted greatly from just about any effort to MAKE IT DIFFERENT FROM THE BOOK.  But that didn't happen.Finally, I gave this movie two stars--but took one away in honor of the God of the Israelites whom this film goes out of its way to mock (takes more guts than I have).C-ya!",1,So Wrong in So Many Ways,1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,2861,"['saw', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Recently', 'received', 'DVD', 'gift', ""'m"", 'still', 'disappointed', 'extras', 'reflect', 'film', 'seem', 'tacked', 'make', 'quick', 'buck', 'sums', 'up', 'movie', 'too', 'casting', 'film', 'bad', 'acting', 'excellent', 'folks', 'are', 'way', 'way', 'miscast', 'not', 'really', 'problem', 'problem', 'shot', 'book', 'just', 'filmed', 'actors', 'reading', 'book', 'Fast', 'approach', 'left', 'bit', 'mess', 'big', 'embarrassment', 'lot', 'skilled', 'talented', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'bad', 'luck', 'be', 'associated', 'film.Actually', 'actors', 'had', 'just', 'read', 'book', 'empty', 'stage', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'action', 'distracting', ""n't"", 'make', 'sit', 'edge', 'seat', 'want', 'go', 'get', 'snack', 'Nothing', 'should', 'shot', 'book.What', 'was', 'required', 'here', 'was', 'courage', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'Writers', 'notoriously', 'resist', 'attempt', 'alter', 'work', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'Well', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'should', 'have', 'encouraged', 'could', 'write', 'bones', 'better', 'script', 'right', 'here', 'will.The', 'first', 'act', 'ship-load', 'weirdos', 'So', 'let', 'explore', 'Langdon', 'professor', 'weird', 'right', 'there', 'Did', 'kill', 'curator', 'French', 'police', 'think', 'did', 'Maybe', 'weirdo', 'Maybe', 'had', 'dispute', 'number', 'apostrophes', 'alphabet', 'soup', 'What', 'strange', 'woman', 'who', 'up', 'butts', 'must', 'be', 'insane', 'ought', 'act', 'little', 'more', 'insane', 'French', 'police', 'are', 'trying', 'arrest', 'killer', 'loony', 'woman', 'get', 'away', 'displays', 'uncanny', 'driving', 'ability', 'doing', 'so.We', 'learn', 'Langdon', 'just', 'weird', 'not', 'killer', 'strange', 'woman', 'not', 'crazy', 'had', 'unusual', 'upbringing', 'Think', 'James', 'Bond', 'meets', 'James', 'Beard', 'Incidentally', 'was', 'hocus', 'pocus', 'DaVinci', 'paintings', 'Langdon', 'figured', 'out', 'were', 'where', 'Th-th-there.', 'WHERE', 'Th-the', 'ladies', 'room', 'mean', 'men', 'room', 'Th-th-th-th-the', 'Never', 'mind', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'give', 'Langdon', 'stutter', 'severe', 'one.Now', ""'re"", 'way', 'scene', 'where', 'albino', 'friend', 'whups', 'silly', 'offensive', 'dumb', 'same', 'time', 'Take', 'cowboy', 'whip', 'regularly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'much', 'Sorta', 'shaving', 'wincing', 'prancing', 'just', 'looked', 'fake', 'not', 'real', 'Hate', 'say', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'really', 'HAS', 'led', 'pain-free', 'life', 'Who', ""'d"", 'a-thunk', 'Now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'whole', 'synopsis', 'here', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'greatly', 'just', 'effort', 'MAKE', 'IT', 'DIFFERENT', 'FROM', 'THE', 'BOOK', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen.Finally', 'gave', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'took', 'one', 'away', 'honor', 'God', 'Israelites', 'whom', 'film', 'way', 'mock', 'more', 'guts', 'have', '.C-ya']",N/A

It's the kind of movie that will have its defenders. But for the most part, they will be defending Dan Brown's Novel, not Ron Howard's movie.  It's not that the film is incompetent.  It just doesn't try hard enough.  It sits there never quite compelling you to do anything but watch it.  It's a thriller with very little thrills.Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks),  Harvard University's most gifted Symbologist,  is in Paris giving a lecture on his new book.  When he is accidentally thrown into the middle of a murder investigation, in which he is the prime suspect.  His only allies are Sophie Neveu, the murdered man's granddaughter, and Sir Leigh Teabing, an eccentric brit with a passion for the holy grail.  Langdon must outrun an over zealous police chief (Jean Reno), a psychotic Albino Monk (Paul Bettany), and a mysterious man called only The Teacher.  In the process he stumbles over the biggest mystery of our age: just what is the Holy Grail?Director Ron Howard does his best to keep us interested in the story.  It's been simplified and changed drastically from the source material, probably so  that modern moviegoers can grasp the material a little easier.  The thing that surprised me most about the changes in the story,  were how they dramatically changed Robert Langdon's character motivations. The Langdon of Dan Brown's famous novel is an expert in the Grail symbology  and goes as far as to defend it to Sophie.  In the film he plays more of the Devil's Advocate questioning more and going as far as to call most of it bunk.  This changes the end of the film dramatically taking a bit of real passion out of it. In essence you're left with a postmodern twist on the story that zaps a lot of meaning out of the plot.Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman script shies away from the controversy of Dan Brown's book, it feels as if the producers sensed a boycott and got cold feet.  I think it hurts the film. Honestly, if your going to court controversy you should jump full in.  If not you've lost the battle.  Now I wished I hadn't slaved through Brown's book.  The film doesn't fill you with much desire to read the book it's based on.On a purely cinematic level it fails because it's not all that compelling.  None of the characters are drawn full enough for you to care about them.  They are lost in a film that has a point A and a point B, but the journey to get there is paved with boring car chases, fake drama, sloppy gunplay and incredibly stilted reveals.  No one seems to have any honest motivation, and problems are solved but not explained.  For instance Langdon and Sophie have this thing called a cryptex, they need to solve a code to get a piece of paper out of it.  But instead of showing us how Langdon figured out the code it just jumps to him solving it.My favorite moment was when Langdon and Sophie need to get to a library to figure out a riddle.  In Dan Brown's novel they spend hours in a library, in the film Sophie borrows some random guy's cell phone and they figure it out on a bus.  I chuckled.All in all THE DAVINCI CODE is the kind of movie that's made to cash in on one of the most popular books in recent history.  Its got star power, its got a big name director, its got a giant budget.  But it's missing a human touch.  It's missing a central heart.  It's not a film about people.  It's a film that just sits there and then fades to black.  Amidst the controversy, amidst the hype, the boycotts, and the millions it will rake in at the box-office THE DAVINCI CODE is much ""ado about nothing.""",2,Lackluster,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,3605,"['had', 'sum', 'THE', 'DAVINCI', 'CODE', 'one', 'word', 'would', 'be', 'lackluster', 'kind', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'defenders', 'most', 'part', 'will', 'be', 'defending', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'Novel', 'not', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'movie', 'not', 'film', 'incompetent', 'just', ""n't"", 'try', 'hard', 'enough', 'there', 'never', 'quite', 'compelling', 'do', 'anything', 'watch', 'thriller', 'very', 'little', 'thrills.Robert', 'Langdon', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Harvard', 'University', 'most', 'gifted', 'Symbologist', 'Paris', 'giving', 'lecture', 'new', 'book', 'When', 'accidentally', 'thrown', 'middle', 'murder', 'investigation', 'prime', 'suspect', 'only', 'allies', 'are', 'Sophie', 'Neveu', 'murdered', 'man', 'granddaughter', 'Sir', 'Leigh', 'Teabing', 'eccentric', 'brit', 'passion', 'holy', 'grail', 'Langdon', 'must', 'outrun', 'zealous', 'police', 'chief', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'psychotic', 'Albino', 'Monk', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'mysterious', 'man', 'called', 'only', 'Teacher', 'process', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'age', 'just', 'what', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'best', 'keep', 'interested', 'story', 'been', 'simplified', 'changed', 'drastically', 'source', 'material', 'probably', 'so', 'modern', 'moviegoers', 'can', 'grasp', 'material', 'little', 'easier', 'thing', 'surprised', 'most', 'changes', 'story', 'were', 'how', 'dramatically', 'changed', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'character', 'motivations', 'Langdon', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'famous', 'novel', 'expert', 'Grail', 'symbology', 'as', 'far', 'defend', 'Sophie', 'film', 'more', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'questioning', 'more', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'call', 'most', 'end', 'film', 'dramatically', 'taking', 'bit', 'real', 'passion', 'essence', ""'re"", 'left', 'postmodern', 'twist', 'story', 'lot', 'meaning', 'plot.Screenwriter', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'script', 'shies', 'away', 'controversy', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'book', 'producers', 'sensed', 'boycott', 'got', 'cold', 'feet', 'think', 'film', 'Honestly', 'going', 'court', 'controversy', 'should', 'jump', 'full', 'not', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'battle', 'Now', 'wished', 'had', ""n't"", 'slaved', 'Brown', 'book', 'film', ""n't"", 'fill', 'much', 'desire', 'read', 'book', 'based', 'purely', 'cinematic', 'level', 'not', 'compelling', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'drawn', 'full', 'enough', 'care', 'are', 'lost', 'film', 'point', 'A', 'point', 'B', 'journey', 'get', 'paved', 'boring', 'car', 'chases', 'fake', 'drama', 'sloppy', 'gunplay', 'incredibly', 'stilted', 'reveals', 'one', 'have', 'honest', 'motivation', 'problems', 'are', 'solved', 'not', 'explained', 'instance', 'Langdon', 'Sophie', 'have', 'thing', 'called', 'cryptex', 'need', 'solve', 'code', 'get', 'piece', 'paper', 'instead', 'showing', 'how', 'Langdon', 'figured', 'out', 'code', 'just', 'solving', 'it.My', 'favorite', 'moment', 'was', 'when', 'Langdon', 'Sophie', 'need', 'get', 'library', 'figure', 'out', 'riddle', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'novel', 'spend', 'hours', 'library', 'film', 'Sophie', 'random', 'guy', 'cell', 'phone', 'figure', 'out', 'bus', 'chuckled.All', 'THE', 'DAVINCI', 'CODE', 'kind', 'movie', 'made', 'cash', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'books', 'recent', 'history', 'got', 'star', 'power', 'got', 'big', 'name', 'director', 'got', 'giant', 'budget', 'missing', 'human', 'touch', 'missing', 'central', 'heart', 'not', 'film', 'people', 'film', 'just', 'there', 'then', 'fades', 'black', 'controversy', 'hype', 'boycotts', 'millions', 'will', 'rake', 'box-office', 'THE', 'DAVINCI', 'CODE', 'much', 'ado', 'nothing']",N/A

In connection with this scene, the French Police pick him up at this event to go to The Louvre, while in the Novel it was very late and he was sleeping at the Hotel.- The whole sequence of escaping The Louvre was much more thrilling in the book, and was over simplified in the Film.- The suspected conspiracy between the Vatican and the Opus Dei has some twists in the book, and was totally change in the film.

There was a lot in the book and the movie tried to squeeze most of it in and it was almost too much to put into 3 hours.  You would think that the movie would be fast moving with so much squeezed in and in one sense it is, but it doesn't seem to convey the action that the book does.  It almost drags at times, in spite of moving rapidly through a lot of events.  I think that people who have not read the book will be somewhat lost trying to follow the movie.  In all fairness, I think this was a very difficult book to transition to the big screen.  Did they fail in that transition?  Not exactly, but it isn't a great success either.  My biggest complaint is probably that Hanks and the woman playing Sophie never seem to develop a good rapport.  Their relationship seems strained through the whole movie; almost like they are somewhat indifferent to each other.  I didn't expect a big romance between them; that's not in the book, but at least they should have developed some warmer feelings for each other.  They just don't click; not good casting.  Hanks was probably not the right person for the role.  I like Hanks okay and he has made many good movies; he just didn't seem like the right person for this role.  For those upset over the content, I think most people know this is fiction and contains a number of factual inaccuracies.  One thing that I think the whole controversy has brought up is that there is no real evidence that Mary Magdaline was ever a prostitute and that she indeed may have been more important to the faith than the church ever acknowledged.  Was she married to Jesus?  No evidence of that either.  It makes for an interesting story, but not of any historical significance.This movie isn't as boring or bad as the harsh critics say.  It could have been so much more, perhaps.  Because the book covers so much ground in so short a time, it would have difficult to really do this movie any better than it was done.",3,Disappointing But Better Than Some Junk Out of Hollywood,1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,2062,"['read', 'book', 'first', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'reading', 'Then', 'saw', 'movie', 'felt', 'little', 'let', 'down', 'was', 'lot', 'book', 'movie', 'tried', 'squeeze', 'most', 'was', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'put', '3', 'hours', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'fast', 'moving', 'so', 'much', 'squeezed', 'one', 'sense', ""n't"", 'seem', 'convey', 'action', 'book', 'almost', 'times', 'spite', 'moving', 'rapidly', 'lot', 'events', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'somewhat', 'lost', 'trying', 'follow', 'movie', 'fairness', 'think', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'book', 'transition', 'big', 'screen', 'Did', 'fail', 'transition', 'Not', 'exactly', ""n't"", 'great', 'success', 'either', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'probably', 'Hanks', 'woman', 'playing', 'Sophie', 'never', 'seem', 'develop', 'good', 'rapport', 'relationship', 'strained', 'whole', 'movie', 'almost', 'are', 'somewhat', 'indifferent', 'other', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'big', 'romance', 'not', 'book', 'least', 'should', 'have', 'developed', 'warmer', 'feelings', 'other', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'click', 'not', 'good', 'casting', 'Hanks', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'right', 'person', 'role', 'Hanks', 'okay', 'made', 'many', 'good', 'movies', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'person', 'role', 'upset', 'content', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'fiction', 'number', 'factual', 'inaccuracies', 'One', 'thing', 'think', 'whole', 'controversy', 'brought', 'up', 'real', 'evidence', 'Mary', 'Magdaline', 'was', 'ever', 'prostitute', 'indeed', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'important', 'faith', 'church', 'ever', 'acknowledged', 'Was', 'married', 'Jesus', 'evidence', 'interesting', 'story', 'not', 'historical', 'significance.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'boring', 'bad', 'harsh', 'critics', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'perhaps', 'book', 'so', 'much', 'ground', 'so', 'short', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'difficult', 'really', 'do', 'movie', 'better', 'was', 'done']",N/A

Incredibly gifted actors like Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, and Ian McKellen were compelled to utter the most banal lines perhaps in their entire careers. I suspected the ending almost half way through the picture.  I have not read Dan Brown's book. The fact that the novel revolves around the possibility of a generation-to-generation conspiracy is inherently preposterous.  Real people rarely keep secrets. A large number never do. The very premise of The Da Vinci Code contradicts everything we know about human psychology. Homo sapiens do not remain loyal to a religious institution they know is premised upon lies. Moreover, they are especially unlikely to murder on its behalf.  I may be an ex-Catholic, but I refuse to indulge in blind hatred towards my former religious home. The Church of Rome deserves better than this slanderous attack.An earlier reviewer perspicaciously pointed out that ""The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.""

(USA Today, May 19, 2006)Instead of remembering that the novel waxes ""pedestrian"" with Eureka moments by utilizing some fairly simplistic brainteasers which lead main characters Robert Langdon, an imminent Harvard symbolist,and Sophie Neveu, DCPJ cryptologist, down a labyrinthine rabbit hole where one amazing conclusion emerges, threatening to tumble the very pillars of Christian dogma decided upon in the year 325 at the council of Nicaea, reviewers penalize the movie for simply following the book's formula without the benefit of the shortened suspense apposite chapters.  Howard chooses for brevity's sake to forego many of the book's conundrums---the mystery of backwards DaVincian script which absorbs two or three pages is wisely condensed into one knowing statement of fact.  In a style typified in ""A Beautiful Mind"" to encapsulate the inner workings of genius schizophrenic John Nash, Howard binds Hans Zimmer music to CSI-demonstrative visual effects to cleverly illustrate each twist of the ultimate conspiracy for those of us not adept at piecing together clues involving art, religion, history, secret societies and arcane rituals.As with most films, Howard's ""Da Vinci Code"" performs to a mainstream audience and should succeed in entertaining accordingly.  A Tom Hanks with a poorly cut wannabe-professor's do plays the part of ""Harrison Ford in Harris Tweed"" with a likeable gravitas that includes ample sympathy and dawning understanding for his accidental sidekick, Amelie-waif Audrey Tautou whose chocolate brown eyes convey all the pathos expected from a by-product of the Greatest Story Ever Told.  Supporting cast members like Ian McKellan---admirably flipping from fanatical scholar to duplicitous tactician----Jean Reno----adding a manly French flavor packet to the book's otherwise stereotypical dogged flatfoot Bezu Fache-----and Paul Bettany-----almost unrecognizable as the overtly intense self-flagellating monk Silas after dryly sarcastic roles in ""Wimbledon"" and ""A Beautiful Mind""-----capture the usual suspense genre second string to quirky perfection.All in all, the movie adequately represents Dan Brown's brainchild, offering to audiences two and a half hours of non-stop entertainment.  Bottom  line?  If the book titillated, so will the movie, in spite of the fact of an already revealed mystery and a reader's digest version of the sub-puzzles.  Visually agreeable, like most high budget films, the book and its characters come to as much of a celluloid life as is rendered possible given the original nature of the novel.

639710,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B00005JOC9,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[4, 5]","The 2003 novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" was one of the best novels I've read in years. It was one of the most adventurous novels that opened up an immense fascination with the topic of Christianity as a faith but especially with the history, both good and bad, of the establishment of the Roman Catholic Church. thus was very much anticipating the big screen adaption of the novel ""The Da Vinci Code"". To my utter, surprise, I think that it actually does an excellent job of doing the book justice to a high degree, even though the book version like all novels is far superior to any possible screen remakes possible. This movie is absolutely a phenomenal movie that I highly recommend seeing at the movie theatre!The movie begins with an elderly man at the Louvre who is brutally murdered by an albino assassin named Silas. At the same time a lecture by a professor named Robert Langdon who is about to give a speech before a audience when a murder of an elderly man at the Louvre museum in Paris France, grabs the attention of Langdon. As Langdon researches the clues of the paintings and Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings, he discovers that the murder victim left a series of messages that contained secrets about the legend of Jesus Christ, his wife Mary Magdalene, and the possibility of there being descendants who are still alive in the present who carry on the truth about Christ's life. Joined by a French cryptologist named Sophie Neveu, Langdon discovers that the elderly man who was murdered was in fact a member of a secret society called the Priority of Sion.The two also discover a golden truth about a Holy Grail that has been `hidden' for over two thousand years that if revealed to the general public, threatens to shake the very foundations of Christianity as a religion.  However, the two find themselves trying to stay ahead of agents of Opus Dei, a hard-line fundamentalist Catholic organization, that vows to prevent the truth of the church from coming out as well as prevent the ""Holy Grail"" from being found. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the numerous complex puzzles and figure out the ancient artifacts, the ""Holy Grail"" will end up being lost forever. It is believed according to the movies timeline that the Catholic Church is based on dubious, if not outright false pretenses on the truth of Jesus Christ and the Vatican is using the false basis as a means to stay in power by deliberately covering up the truth about the life of Christ as well as the story of his supposed wife Mary Magdalene and their descendants.This movie in my opinion, actually does a great job of making an awesome novel into an actual movie. Granted, the book is far superior to the movie but for a movie adaptation, ""The Da Vinci Code"" ranks as one of the best screen adaptations I've seen in recent years. There is rarely, if ever, a dull moment throughout the entire movie. The whole topic of religion and faith, even though I'm technically a Presbyterian (I was baptized a Presbyterian when I was two), is fascinating. The movie has renewed my interest in learning more about the `official' as well as the true history of Christianity as well as it's numerous denominations and branches, both Catholic and Protestant as well as other branches of the religion.I was totally surprised to actually see that Sir Ian McKellan actually stars in this movie as the eccentric researcher Leigh Teabigh as he helps the two find the artifacts and solve the puzzles before the clandestine Opus Dei and it's agents find it and hide it forever from the outside world. Tom Hanks was the perfect choice for the role of Robert Langdon. Even as I read the novel itself, I for some reason actually envisioned Tom Hanks playing him in the movie and to my pleasant surprise, was proven right all along. Though I don't want to change the subject too much in this review, Hanks is the most flexible actor I know of, as he plays the best average-joes in movies. He can play almost all kinds of characters, both good and evil. Paul Bettamy is scary as the albino assassin Silas with the scary looking eyes and facial expressions throughout the movie. Even more surprising was Alfred Molina who played Doctor Octavius in Spiderman 2 two years before then. Molina is great as the priest of the Prion of Sion who is loyal to the Teacher of the organization.The book and movie have come under enormous criticism from the Catholic Church as well as other Christian sects for what is believed to be fabrications and distortions of the truth. The ""Da Vinci Code"" is a fictional book and thus I can't say I believe that all of the things are necessarily true. However, I do believe that there is a large amount of truths that are out there about the life of Jesus Christ that have yet to see the light of day. Anyhow, back to the movie, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is among the best novel adaptations that I've seen in years. I strongly recommend seeing this movie today!",5,"Never a dull moment in ""The Da Vinci Code""",1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,4937,"['2003', 'novel', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'was', 'one', 'best',

I generally eschew pop culture, which this book most certainly is, yet when I caught the film version of THE DA VINCI CODE on cable recently, I immediately was entertained.  I knew bits and pieces of the story--the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar, the Apocrypha, a Vatican cover-up--so it didn't take much (a disturbing, very bizarre murder/mutilation) to get me hooked as this fast-paced thriller took off.So because I had not read the book, I had no preconceived notions of main character Robert Langdon; accordingly, Tom Hanks was just fine--although his hair was kind of. . .odd.  Hanks plays very well off the delightful Audrey Tautou, who in turn possesses a most euphonious accent (and is easy on the eye).  Following the murder both Hanks and Tautou embark on a breathless journey through France and England--pursued by the police and a self-flagellating albino monk--in search of an artifact that, if found, could scandalize Christianity to its very ecclesiastical core.  They are joined in the chase by an ornery Ian McKellen playing a colleague of Hanks and a self-proclaimed Holy Grail expert.Through all the twists and turns this film reaches its inevitable over-the-top ending, yet it's all good religious fun.  And through the viewing experience I learned about symbology, cryptology, the Priory, Da Vinci's 'The Last Supper', and a well-traveled sarcophagus--all without reading the book, mind you.

639715,A1AYEI2SNFPYES,B00005JOC9,Dogville,"[6, 9]","The Da Vinci Code when viewed strictly on its own merit worked flawlessly as a well-executed mystery thriller. There's mind-boggling suspense, unexplained theories and unresolved mysteries within the span of the film's 150 minutes.However, when it comes to the subject material, staunch Christians were riled no end by Dan Brown's fiction, calling them blasphemous lies. The published book certainly didn't quite create such a stir back in 2003. Yes, the thing is, in a bid to confine the movie to a reasonable length on screen, part of the intriguing plot in print was left out, making viewers who haven't read the book beforehand guess more than they should.Dan Brown's postulations were taken too seriously by some quarters. He never really claimed that they were true but merely conjectures based on his research or understanding of the faith.Now, the acting. I am generally pleased with the performances by the cast despite criticisms that Tom Hanks didn't look the part of the character David Langdon in the book. Well, I thought he did well. Hanks did give the character of the symbologist his own flavor, his constant frown conveyed a sense of urgency in solving the mystery and clearing his name.The always beautiful Audrey Tautou who plays professional cryptographer Sophie Neveu is perhaps the only likable character throughout the show. The role might not demand much of her as the sidekick of Hanks' Langdon but Tautou gives a serious performance coming to terms with her grandfather's death and discovering her true identity. It's a welcome departure from the usually impish and wide-eyed roles that Tautou plays.Ian McKellen's over-zealous historian, Sir Leigh Teabing adds to the mystery when Langdon and Neveu shows up at his door seeking for help to unravel the hidden truth. McKellen's acting prowress is undoubtedly splendid.Paul Bettany's in his role as the obsessed and self-mutilating-in-the-name-of-god Silas was scene-stealing (he was almost unrecognizable). The conviction in his eyes and behaviour would be one of the highs of the movie as he seeks to further the cause of the religion.My only disappointment was with Jean Reno. But again, his role was severely limited so we could only see his Opus Dei character Captain Fache pull a long face and all the stops at trying to foil Langdon's and Neveu's plans at every juncture.No one should really complain at the adequacy of The Da Vinci Code as a functioning thriller despite some of Dan Brown's more ludicrous assertions. After all, we must remember this is fiction not theology. The way to enjoy the Da Vinci Code on screen is to watch it with a free and unprejudiced mind.

All this makes it easier to understand.As for the acting, I thought both Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou were good in their roles. But I think the stand-outs for acting in this movie are Paul Bettany and Alfred Molina. Bettany sure has a difficult role as the monk who is after Hank's character.Also, I consider myself Christian and the movie and book didn't bother me. It is just Fiction after all, or just one person's idea. I like the fact that the movie leaves you thinking about religion and the meaning behind it, and shows that the people in the film believe in their faith very deeply. There are many scenes that address Jesus' Divinity and Humanity, and I think that is a good thing thing to show a movie audience.So there are a lot of issues in this movie that will really make you think about Jesus and religion.

The story revolves around the fact that the Catholic Church in general, and members of Opus Dei in particular, are happy to have perpetuated the mythical story of a divine and celibate Jesus for 2000 years. In Brown's story, and the film, Mary Magdalene was the wife or mistress of Jesus and bore him children. The film is a thriller in that a professor of cryptography, Robert Langdon (hugely miscast I thought in the person of Tom Hanks), is roped in by a police Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) to interpret an apparently coded message left by a dying priest. The priest has a pentagram carved on his chest but has also left a message beside his body that neither the police nor Langdon can make any sense of at first. Langdon is aided in his quest by the beautiful policewoman Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), a specialist in code-breaking. What neither Langdon or Neveu know at the start is that Fache (is the resemblance to Fascist just coincidental?) is himself a member of opus Dei. The message when finally deciphered is that the Holy Grail is hidden somewhere and will reveal the true descendant of Jesus. Opus Dei are also seeking the Holy Grail in order to keep secret the fact that Jesus has a living descendant and the man charged with this mission is the evil Bishop Manuel Aringarosa (Alfred Molina), aided and abetted by his hit-man Silas (Paul Bettany).

Translating Dan Brown's masterpiece onto the screen without screwing up *something* is only slightly short of impossible. Ron Howard (Opie Cunningham :-) really nailed it with this one. The casting was spot-on, from the creepy albino to the ultra-sexy-yet-""practical"" hottie (sorry I forgot her name), and Tom hanks as the harried professor. They didn't overplay the romance either, which was refreshing. What made this movie so great, and why you absolutely MUST see it in wide screen (and ONLY) in wide screen is that it was shot (filmed) in 70mm - wiiiide format. The symbology captured on film here is so implicit to the plot, that even the edges of the screen reveal extra tidbits of fact and emotion that drive the points home.This movie caused a storm of controversy (as well it should) and firmly placed the book it was based on in the general psyche of a generation. The point of whether or not Jesus existed, or even had kids is overshadowed by the tense suspense and actions of the shadowy governmental bodies at play here. This is a movie about history and those who ""make"" (write) it. It is a fun story that happens to involve the Vatican, the Louvre, Jesus, and a host of other characters and places you might recognize at a glance, but it is also an allegory of our global civilization, and our minuscule, yet ever-potent place within it. As each of us has the power to change the very world around us (as the ""real"" or ""fictional"" Jesus has), we are all subject to the laws and conspiracies that attach themselves to us - just like the characters in this movie.

639730,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JOC9,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","The dense plot complexities of Dan Brown's novel around the pursuit of the Holy Grail made it a thoroughly entertaining read, but the unending plethora of detail looks contrived and ultimately predictable when translated onscreen. Having Ron Howard helm this 2006 production assures a mainstream-oriented consciousness would predominate, but unfortunately, it also means a lack of pervasive invention when it comes to conveying the dramatic twists and turns of Brown's story. Moreover, Akiva Goldsman's screenplay requires scenes of lengthy exposition which Howard tries to offset with fantasy visualizations of speculative religious history. However, the core problem is that the filmmakers' diligent attempts at remaining faithful to the book make the movie feel overstuffed within its lengthy running time of 149 minutes.For those who don't know, the focus of the plot is on the hunt for the secrets hidden by the Priory of Sion including the Holy Grail. Some want to protect it, some want to expose it, and some want to destroy it. Harvard professor Robert Langdon and Paris police cryptologist Sophie Neveu, equipped with secrets shared by the murdered curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauni&eacute;re, are a step ahead of the police, assassins, and churchmen in full pursuit. After what looks to be a standard murder mystery set-up, the story finally gains momentum in the second hour with the creatively handled explanation for the hidden meanings behind Da Vinci's ""Last Supper"". A historical labyrinth is presented piecemeal, incorporating the origins of the gospels and the assimilation of pagan rituals and symbols into the early church's practices, all of which showcases the revelatory role of Mary Magdalene in scripture. While Langdon is the nominal protagonist, Sophie emerges as the pivotal character here, especially as they recognize how her past provides keys to vital information that could change history and religion.Casting is a challenge here since the actors are really there merely to support the convoluted storyline. As dazzling as she has been in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's films, Audrey Tautou of ""Amelie"" fame is comparatively constrained as Sophie, though she also seems a bit burdened by the verbosity of the role. As Langdon, a lank-haired Tom Hanks is more problematic as his versatility is sorely tested by playing an academically-oriented sleuth. Stealing scenes easily is Ian McKellan as erudite, Grail-obsessed Sir Leigh Teabing. On the other hand, Paul Bettany merely exhibits a fairly one-note malignancy as the murdering albino monk Silas. Also left to their own elliptical devices are Jean Reno as the secretive Captain Fache and Alfred Molina as Opus Dei's designated kingpin, Bishop Sringarosa. The film's plodding pace is offset somewhat by Salvatore Totino's superb cinematography, especially at the Louvre and other European locales.Thinking back  on the film, I keep wondering if it could have benefited more from a fresher director like Darren Aronofsky or Christopher Nolan, or even Quentin Tarantino's pulpish approach since the kinetic thriller elements are ripe enough for his cinematic audacity. The two-disc 2006 DVD set is certainly full of extras. Disc One contains the movie and several previews for upcoming theatrical releases. Disc Two has all the extras, which consist mainly of ten featurettes on various aspects of the production and its translation from Brown's hugely successful novel. The best of the bunch is ""The Codes of the Da Vinci Code"", which has Howard and Brown explain much of the symbolism used specifically in the film.",3,Some Nice Visual Flourishes in a Muddled Adaptation of Dan Brown's Religion-Fueled Thriller,1164240000,"11 23, 2006",2006,3592,"['dense', 'plot', 'complexities', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'novel', 'pursuit', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'made', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'read', 'unending', 'plethora', 'detail', 'looks', 'contrived', 'ultimately', 'predictable', 'when', 'translated', 'onscreen', 'Having', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'helm', '2006', 'production', 'mainstream-oriented', 'consciousness', 'would', 'predominate', 'unfortunately', 'also', 'lack', 'pervasive', 'invention', 'when', 'conveying', 'dramatic', 'twists', 'turns', 'Brown', 'story', 'Moreover', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'screenplay', 'scenes', 'lengthy', 'exposition', 'Howard', 'offset', 'fantasy', 'visualizations', 'speculative', 'religious', 'history', 'However', 'core', 'problem', 'filmmakers', 'diligent', 'attempts', 'remaining', 'faithful', 'book', 'make', 'movie', 'feel', 'overstuffed', 'lengthy', 'running', 'time', '149', 'minutes.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'focus', 'plot', 'hunt', 'secrets', 'hidden', 'Priory', 'Sion', 'including', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'want', 'protect', 'want', 'expose', 'want', 'destroy', 'Harvard', 'professor', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'Paris', 'police', 'cryptologist', 'Sophie', 'Neveu', 'equipped', 'secrets', 'shared', 'murdered', 'curator', 'Louvre', 'Jacques', 'Sauni', 'eacute', 're', 'are', 'step', 'ahead', 'police', 'assassins', 'churchmen', 'full', 'pursuit', 'what', 'be', 'standard', 'murder', 'mystery', 'set-up', 'story', 'finally', 'gains', 'momentum', 'second', 'hour', 'creatively', 'handled', 'explanation', 'hidden', 'meanings', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Last', 'Supper', 'historical', 'labyrinth', 'presented', 'piecemeal', 'incorporating', 'origins', 'gospels', 'assimilation', 'pagan', 'rituals', 'symbols', 'early', 'church', 'practices', 'revelatory', 'role', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'scripture', 'Langdon', 'nominal', 'protagonist', 'Sophie', 'pivotal', 'character', 'here', 'especially', 'recognize', 'how', 'past', 'keys', 'vital', 'information', 'could', 'change', 'history', 'religion.Casting', 'challenge', 'here', 'actors', 'are', 'really', 'there', 'merely', 'support', 'convoluted', 'storyline', 'As', 'dazzling', 'been', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Jeunet', 'films', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'Amelie', 'fame', 'comparatively', 'constrained', 'Sophie', 'also', 'bit', 'burdened', 'verbosity', 'role', 'Langdon', 'lank-haired', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'more', 'problematic', 'versatility', 'sorely', 'tested', 'playing', 'academically-oriented', 'sleuth', 'Stealing', 'scenes', 'easily', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'erudite', 'Grail-obsessed', 'Sir', 'Leigh', 'Teabing', 'other', 'hand', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'merely', 'fairly', 'one-note', 'malignancy', 'murdering', 'albino', 'monk', 'Silas', 'Also', 'left', 'own', 'elliptical', 'devices', 'are', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'secretive', 'Captain', 'Fache', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'designated', 'kingpin', 'Bishop', 'Sringarosa', 'film', 'plodding', 'pace', 'offset', 'somewhat', 'Salvatore', 'Totino', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'especially', 'Louvre', 'other', 'European', 'locales.Thinking', 'back', 'film', 'keep', 'wondering', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'more', 'fresher', 'director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'even', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'pulpish', 'approach', 'kinetic', 'thriller', 'elements', 'are', 'ripe', 'enough', 'cinematic', 'audacity', 'two-disc', '2006', 'DVD', 'set', 'certainly', 'full', 'extras', 'Disc', 'One', 'movie', 'several', 'previews', 'upcoming', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'Disc', 'Two', 'extras', 'consist', 'mainly', 'ten', 'featurettes', 'various', 'aspects', 'production', 'translation', 'Brown', 'hugely', 'successful', 'novel', 'best', 'bunch', 'Codes', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'Howard', 'Brown', 'explain', 'much', 'symbolism', 'used', 'specifically', 'film']",N/A

""Memoirs of a Geisha"" turned out to be a disappointment when I saw the film adaptation. I was a bit wary when I heard that ""The Da Vinci Code"" was going to be turned into a movie but all suspicions were put to rest when I saw a trailer for it a month or two ago.The premise of the film revolves around the death of an elderly art curator who leaves behind a series of clues to a box that contains a map to the Holy Grail and from there a 2 1/2 hour rollercoaster thrill ride. Tom Hanks plays symobologist Robert Langdon who is the prime suspect in the death of the curator. With the assistance from Sophie Neveu (the lovely Audrey Tatou), the pair. The duo immediately sets off on a journey which involves a box with a five petal rose, inside what may possibly be a map to the holy grail.I have read the novel and the film adaptation is pretty spot on. There were a few minor alterations but nothing major. I personally enjoyed the film for what it was which is entertainment. Do I believe that Jesus and Mary Magdelene had a child and she survived to continue on their bloodline? No. Both the book and the novel is purely fictional.What I liked about the film was the build up in suspense through out the film. I personally thought Ron Howard did a pretty good job on creating an aura of suspense in the scenes involving Silas (Paul Bettany) or when Robert and Sophie were running from the cops. I loved Hans Zimmer's orchestral score. It fit perfectly with the theme of the film.What I didn't like about the film is Ron Howard's addiction to flashback scenes. Like Peter Jackson, Ron just does not know how to edit his films. I admit I liked the flashback scenes but after awhile they got annoying. Any wonders why I don't see Ron's films in the theatre, it is because they are too freaking long. Tom Hanks may be a good actor but I felt that someone else probably could have been a more convincing Robert Langdon.  I loved the supporting cast though. I found his long hair in the film rather distracting. It looked like Peppe LePew the skunk died on top of his head.Overall I enjoyed ""The Da Vinci Code"" as a movie and nothing more. I liked the twists and turns in the storyline. Ian McKellan was a lot of fun to watch as well as Paul Bettany as the creepy Silas.

And much to my surprise, I ended up really liking this adaptation. I think Howard has done a highly commendable job with transferring the book to the big screen. On the one hand, it wasn't an easy task, as so much takes place in the book in such a short amount of time. But on the other hand, it *was* an easy task, as the book reads like a movie script to begin with (we have to admit that). So in a way Howard already had all the pieces he needed (including most of the dialog); his job was simply to put them all together and create the finished product. But I'll reiterate that all in all I think he did a good job with it.This movie basically follows the book almost note-for-note, which some will argue is its strong point whereas others will argue the total opposite. I tend to go with it being a strong point. Howard never intended to reinvent the story nor add his own vision to it. It's as if he directed it through Dan Brown's eyes. Changing the story would have caused more uproar than the uproar caused simply by the movie being made in the first place. And changing the story would not have attracted Da Vinci Code-haters to the theaters. Simply put, this movie was made for fans of the book and nobody else. I've heard many people say that the movie is shallow. Well, so is the book. You take an average-looking person and stand them in front of a mirror and the person in the mirror looking back at them isn't going to be beautiful.Performance-wise, I have no complaints, although I found Jean Reno's portrayal of Fache to be extremely over-the-top and overdone. IMO Paul Bettany stole the show as Silas, even if they forgot to give him red contact lenses. Audrey Tautou was perfect as Sophie (and by the way, she can decipher MY code any day, and would quickly see that it spells out L-O-V-E). And of course, Tom Hanks as Langdon. Sure, there are other actors who could have taken on the role just as well. But Hanks does more than a competent job.Howard does make a handful of minor changes, although none compromise the story in any way. For example, he changes the way Silas attacks Langdon at Teabing's home. But one change I'd like to mention, a change that I feel benefited the movie a great deal, is Howard's decision not to have Langdon and Sophie hook up at the end. One thing about the book I hated was the hackeyed, almost obligatory and forced eventual hook-up of those two. Although Langdon and Sophie hint at a possible attraction in the movie, it doesn't go beyond that.I'll end by saying that this movie adaptation easily equals, if not slightly exceeds, the book. Again, if you thought this adaptation was hollow, read the book again and see that it's not that much different. So, I give this film 4 stars based on its own merits, but also based on Howard's successful transfer of the book into a visual medium without trying to outdo it.

We read the book first, then acquired a previous work by the same author, Angels & Demons, which is also a masterpiece. The controversy created by these books provide an ever-ending topic of conversation. While reading the book, I could not believe that I had missed seeing the ""clues"" mentioned by the author on the works of Da Vinci, especially with regards to his famous ""The Last Supper."" So we went to the library, obtained an arts book and with a magnifying glass, observed that all details as mentioned by the book were there, and yet, they had gone unnoticed when we had studied the work. If you allow yourself to research as you go along reading, The Da Vinci Code is simply... fascinating. When the movie came out, a group of friends went to see it at the theatre, and we then had dinner to discuss the performance. We agree that the movie is fabulous. The plot is followed to provide entertainment without measure, but, we agreed that for those who had not read the book, the movie could be rather confusing. The script follows Dan Brown's book to the point, incorporating changes that were surprising and welcomed, for the ending is easier to understand. The performance by Tom Hanks, who plays the Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon is excellent. The images played on the screen behind him immediately allows us to realize the power of symbols and how deceptive they may be if we do not know the origin and meaning intended when they were created. Audrey Tautou plays Sophie Neveu and does an outstanding job, very believable. The movie is filmed on location and it is simply superb to be able to see the book we loved to read... come to life! Neveu and Langdon join forces to solve many mysteries and they capture our attention and imagination from the start. Sir Ian McKellen provides an excellent performance as Sir Leigh Teabing, making this movie an unforgettable experience.

The critics were totally wrong, they crucified the movie by saying ""it has a terrible story, terrible acting and is boringly long"".The Da Vinci Code is a very enjoyable movie.  It is a perfect representation of the book, where every scene is recognizable.  The acting is farely good with good performances from Jean Reno and Sir Ian McKellen.  The only bad acting was from Tom Hanks, who talks as if he's reading directly from the book and drags on with a repetitive and bland tone.  He just has no character in this movie.  Paul Bettany, who plays the albino monk is also quite good as the psychopathic killer hunting Sophie and Robert Langdon.When I read the book, I loved it and was the only book that I had read from start to finish without putting it down.

639743,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,B00005JOC9,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[2, 2]","The Da Vinci Code is a decent film that could have been a great one, but it has some problems. In what follows, I'm going to focus on the problems, as a bit of constructive criticism.Unlike many viewers, I don't believe that the problems are related to the film's subject matter or ""thesis"". I also don't believe that the problems lie with the book-to-film ""translation"". I don't take this film as anything other than fiction, and I like my fiction to have strong fantastical elements. For me, there is no taboo subject matter, and there are no taboo ways of fictionalizing the actual world to create interesting artworks. As for book-to-film translations, in my view it is a mistake amounting to a category error to try to compare books and films--they're two very different mediums. It's not only fine for films to be very different from their corresponding books and vice versa, it's unavoidable.Rather, the problems with The Da Vinci Code all stem from one fact that requires much caution when storytelling--it's plot-heavy. The story here (and keep in mind in what follows that I'm talking about this as fiction, relative to the film's world) is a very complex one that necessitates explaining and then tying together a wide variety of historical and other ""academic"" material. The main character, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), has to solve something of a puzzle, and another character, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) accompanies him. At one point they're assisted by yet another character, Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen). They each know things that the others need to know in order for the puzzle to be solved, and the entire film involves them explaining and to some extent figuring out these things as they go along--which functions to also explain the ""thesis"" to the audience. Of course this requires a lot of dialogue, and because of the subject matter, it tends to involve ""telling"" rather than ""showing"".Now, the kind of film explained above isn't inherently problematic. It can be done with finesse in a very exciting way--a prime example is National Treasure (2004). Director Jon Turtletaub made that film work as a suspenseful action-adventure flick as well as any James Bond or Mission: Impossible film, while still retaining an intriguingly complex mythology along with the intellectual pleasures of puzzle solving. For The Da Vinci Code, helmer Ron Howard doesn't completely abandon action and adventure, but he too often forgets about it, and it's rare that it becomes very suspenseful. It's a shame, because when Howard remembers to keep those elements present, The Da Vinci Code shows how great it could have been. At a couple points, Howard takes another angle--making the film play like more of a fictional documentary. That approach worked, too, but it's also left by the wayside much of the time, and the end result is inconsistent. There are too many stretches where it's just Langdon or Neveu or Teabing explaining and helping each other figure out the story, and everything else--all of the mise en sc&egrave;ne--functions just as decoration.There are other aspects of the film hurt by this approach, especially characterization. For example, there are villains in this story, and the villains seem to be involved in complex (somewhat) conspiratorial relationships with one another. But only one villain is developed as a character, with a few others functioning more like movable props. And those others are meant to be the primary source of suspense. We just don't know them well enough--what they're capable of and why they're doing what they are--for the suspense scenes to work; they're more faceless than suspenseful.Another problem is that the storytelling mechanics are too transparent. I'm usually awful at guessing plot twists. Here, I guessed them all almost immediately (without reading the book first, although I knew the gist of the ""thesis"", as probably everyone at this point does). At the same time, too much is left a bit vague--again especially when it comes to the villains. For example, I never did quite understand what Captain Bezu Fache's (Jean Reno) position and role in the events was, especially with respect to his relationship with Bishop Manuel Aringarosa (Alfred Molina). I suspect that was better explained in the book, but films shouldn't have prerequisites.(And another problem suggesting that maybe prerequisites were suggested was given in the DVD extras--there are references to the ""thesis"" worked into the film symbolically--for example, references to supposed members of the Priory of Sion. The only way to catch the significance is to be versed in the mythology already. While some references for ""insiders"" can be fun, how much more interesting would it have been for the film as an artwork to create more robust internal, self-contained puzzles and references on this level instead? There is a bit of that--for example, the ""forest for the trees"" reconceptualization theme, and that's one of the film's highlights, but most of the subtextual puzzle-like references are to outside information from the relevant mythology.)So that's focusing on the problems. But The Da Vinci Code isn't exactly a horrible film. I enjoyed watching it enough to watch it again in the future. Although the tone of the film is a bit inconsistent, most other aspects of Howard's direction are good, the performances are fine, and the technical aspects are very good. It's definitely worth a watch if you're interested in the relevant genres, and if you're intrigued by the relation of the ""thesis"" to the actual world--as many folks are, both pro and con--then you just may love it . . . or love to hate it.",3,More Blank than Frank,1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,5654,"['Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'decent', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'one', 'problems',

The movie presents a religious opinion that christens and Catholics will hate.  I was born and raised christen even though I barley care about religion.  I gave this movie a chance to teach me something new.  This film is not very good at all.  The script is preachy.  The acting is decent, not great even though there is an amazing cast.  They all almost act like they are sleepy while doing their lines.  The story is full of holes, and sometimes it moves too fast and sometimes not fast enough to keep the audiences attention.  Visually it's not of epic proportions.  Let's just say its no Memoirs of a Geisha in the visual department.  The events themselves are almost silly at times.  For example Tom Hanks can do an anagram what might take most people days in a matter or seconds, and he just happens to know, well, everything there is about history.  Some characters are underdeveloped, like Tom Hanks character, while others have too much back story for their own good.  The movie as a whole though is very interesting and is not that hard to understand.  If you don't sweat the small stuff then the film is very entertaining and actually pretty good.  (*(*(*(*(SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!)*)*)*)*)  The films one biggest flaw is that it tries to stress that all sexes are equal, but in the end its all talk no action.  Audrey Tautou who is supposed to be the key is actually useless.  She does basically nothing.  She is supposed to know how everything works but she can't do the puzzles so she needs Tom Hanks, who is supposed to know nothing about all this, to do all of them for her.  Also they talk about how great it would be for a female to take over the church which I agree would be fantastic, but they just assume that the next heir to the thrown is a man.  This movie is a sexist attack on sexism.  But its heart is in the right place I guess.  (*(*(*(*(END OF SPOILER END OF SPOILER END OF SPOILER)*)*)*)*)  In all, this movie was pretty good.

It was dynamic, well paced, and it gave (at least it tried) an insight to the characters' motivations and reasons.

This is an epic film on a small scale. It is subtle, reverent and quiet, ever so quiet! I try to never compare a novel to a film or visa versa. They are just two completely different mediums of telling a story and each has its strengths. This film is a visual delight. Tom Hanks' performance is one of the most restrained I have ever seen for a main character in a film yet he maintains control by the nature of his well-defined character. Ian McKellen is quite the flamboyant counterpart to Hanks, yet who comes off best at the conclusion being the most levelheaded? Jean Reno gives a very restrained and dedicated performance and one of true conviction to his character, which helps this film immensely. Hans Zimmer's score is once again on target and he seems to be getting better with each film. This is a story of fiction and a good one.

639762,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JOC9,Grady Harp,"[3, 8]","After all the hoopla and controversy parting the waters between the religious right and Catholic Church and the avid devotees of Dan Brown's multi-million dollar success book, the movie version is finally here.  THE DA VINCI CODE makes a  good movie - and that is enough.Director Ron Howard has assembled a good international cast, trusted the screenplay to Akiva Goldsman, and in fine Hollywood style has transformed an interesting premise of a story from Dan Brown's interested though unsophisticatedly written blockbuster into a suspense thriller.  The story of a murder in the Louvre leading a former flatfoot detective turned writer of symbology and a French cryptographer on a chase involving the Vatican, the Opus Dei society, and the Priory guarding the Holy Grail is full of terrific visualizations of some of the encrypted secrets of Brown's novel and in the end the movie allows the viewer to follow the interesting story much more easily than did the book.The settings are magnificent (cinematography by Salvatore Totino), the musical score by Hans Zimmer sweeps the story along embracing all aspects of the atmosphere, and the visual effects department has done a fine job with some tough tasks.  The actors take their characters in stride, given that many of them are over the top figures: Ian McKellen will satisfy every reader's vision of Sir Leigh Teabing; Paul Bettany is appropriately crazy as Silas; Jean Reno offers a Captain Fache who manages to hold things together; Audrey Tatou turns a fine spin as the all-important Sophie Neveu; and Tom Hanks sleepwalks through his rather innocuous conception of Robert Langdon.  And the ending is a rather sappy sellout not found in the book - but this is Hollywood...This film may set box office records - which seems to be the point in making it - and serves to prove what good PR work can do for a movie.  Many will put down 'The Da Vinci Code' because of religious reasons or other reasons, but in the end it is a just a good story well told - not a great movie but an entertaining one.  Recommendation: a good 2 1/2 hour diversion, but not one to rush out to see until the crowds dwindle a bit.

Besides it's promotion, that is. Like it's art history subject matter, I expected a cinematic canvas of depth and beauty, but this is more like standard action fare, as Ron Howard's generic and hurried direction rushes by like he's filming NASCAR and throwing a rude mustache on the Mona Lisa. It breathes like a lesser James Bond film, with lots of facial concentrations, typical car crash and shoot 'em up violence, and so much conversation, at times they may as well be reading aloud from the book. Unlike the book, (I suppose), it is more indebted to the action genre than it is art history, even the spliced flashback images of ancient times seems more an homage to Cecil B. DeMille, than it is true history. Tom Hanks never quite grips the role of an ancient symbols expert thrown into a diabolical plot, his security and knowledge of the subject matter is aloof and increasingly dissipates as the film progresses, like you expect him to moronically and unknowingly burst, ""Hey, this is some heavy stuff!"", at any moment. Audrey Tatou's role as a student of cryptic analysis, is reduced to what seems a dull investigative reporter, full of routine questions, and duly surprised reaction that only serve as springboards for the film to delve into a facts and legends expose. Picture a big budget History Channel on Halloween night. There's also a grueling sort of half-hearted glibness at mention of what seems controversial subjects; The Pope, Catholics, a blood line French family, as if the film smugly retains a secret it yet shares with its audience, and a ridiculously indulgent line uttered by Hanks at the height of action; ""I've got to get to a library!"", that suggests to the audience to look it up themselves if the film falls short of total explanation.

(It is too artificial and you may observe it in the book); second, how could the screenwriter to forget the invaluable information about the integrants of Zion's Priorate? it's really unforgiving, third, the sequences in the Ritual I which Sophie saw his grandfather are not enough explained, and that causes a profound distortion on the whole understanding process; four the crucial message around the Virgin of the rocks is simply ignored; five the presence of the watchman at the moment they enter at the temple searching for the graves? ; six: it is not well explained the distorted and brutalizing existence and late conversion of Silas, seven: the final ending in the book suggest us a probably reencounter of Langdon and Sophie, eight: the rivalry between both police officers is not carved in relief; nine there two criptex nor just one; ten what about the enromous significance about the letter V?.In order to adjust certain characters I would have suggested those actors:  Sean Penn,  Tim Roth, Jude Law, Daniel Day Lewis, Robert Downey Jr. or Joseph Fiennes  in the role of Tom Hanks who looked overacted and out of context respect the character of Robert Langdon;  Audrey Tatoo is OK,  and Daniel Auteil as Fache, Gary Oldman or Edward Norton as Silas; Chris Cooper, Tom Wilkinson, Harvey Keitel or Aidan Quinn  as Aringarosa, with a director of more penetrating vision ; four directors come to my mind: Jean Jacques Anaud, Oliver Hirshbiegel, Sam Mendes or Jonathan Demme.",2,A terrible disappointment!,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,2455,"['Here', 'have', 'intriguing', 'hyper', 'interesting', 'novel', 'converted', 'greedy', 'concessions', 'market', 'cheap', 'thriller', 'where', 'many', 'important', 'details', 'are', 'simply', 'ignored', 'order', 'convey', 'worst', 'still', 'disorient', 'great', 'audiences', 'relevant', 'dramatic', 'core.Audrey', 'Tatoo', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'expected', 'chemistry', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'worst', 'still', 'director', 'personage', 'extremely', 'flat', 'much', 'better', 'actress', 'think', 'case', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'watched', 'screen', 'only', 'actors', 'who', 'really', 'shone', 'stranded', 'mess', 'were', 'Ian', 'Mac', 'Kellen', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow.I', 'try', 'fit', 'hat', 'viewers', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'frankly', 'understand', 'are', 'many', 'holes', 'script', 'necessarily', 'must', 'complete', 'reading', 'book.I', 'really', 'would', 'like', 'remark', 'ten', 'fundamental', 'inconsistencies', 'script', 'first', 'one', 'How', 'did', 'Langdon', 'get', 'obtain', 'secret', 'code', 'open', 'criptex', 'end', 'too', 'artificial', 'may', 'observe', 'book', 'second', 'how', 'could', 'screenwriter', 'forget', 'invaluable', 'information', 'integrants', 'Zion', 'Priorate', 'really', 'unforgiving', 'third', 'sequences', 'Ritual', 'Sophie', 'saw', 'grandfather', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'explained', 'profound', 'distortion', 'whole', 'understanding', 'process', 'four', 'crucial', 'message', 'Virgin', 'rocks', 'simply', 'ignored', 'five', 'presence', 'watchman', 'moment', 'enter', 'temple', 'searching', 'graves', 'six', 'not', 'well', 'explained', 'distorted', 'brutalizing', 'existence', 'late', 'conversion', 'Silas', 'seven', 'final', 'ending', 'book', 'suggest', 'probably', 'reencounter', 'Langdon', 'Sophie', 'eight', 'rivalry', 'police', 'officers', 'not', 'carved', 'relief', 'nine', 'two', 'criptex', 'just', 'one', 'ten', 'what', 'enromous', 'significance', 'letter', 'V', '.In', 'order', 'adjust', 'certain', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'suggested', 'actors', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'role', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'who', 'looked', 'overacted', 'context', 'respect', 'character', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'Audrey', 'Tatoo', 'OK', 'Daniel', 'Auteil', 'Fache', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Silas', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Aringarosa', 'director', 'more', 'penetrating', 'vision', 'four', 'directors', 'come', 'mind', 'Jean', 'Jacques', 'Anaud', 'Oliver', 'Hirshbiegel', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'Jonathan', 'Demme']",N/A

Yet having read the book twice and loving it as many times I have read it, this film feels like a bit of a rushed, one drafted film.As I started reading the book when it was first Published , I enjoyed it tremendously. When reading it, I felt that all the concepts of the book and the well paced story were very well written and cleverly done. Yet in this film it was rushed and missed key points coherent to the story and I personally believe that these were necessary, but that happens when a film cannot be so long. The First 20-30mins was rushed and far to concerned with getting the chase and investigation underway. Yet as stated by Ian McKellen in Johnathan Ross' program Ron Howard had made it a 'Action Thriller'.There are many good performances provided by Jean Reno, Audrey Tautou & Ian McKellen especially that of Paul Bettanny as Silas. The part of Robert Langdon played by Tom Hanks, was much more extrovert throughout the book, yet in the film; his part, until the second halve and end of the film, his character was 'kept back' in the film.The flashbacks in the film were vague and yet I still believe very much essential to that of the characters, which made the character more developed and less hollow. The flashbacks of Silas were very good, however they were rushed and a slightly empty and not giving the whole picture of how the character came to be.The History of Christ and Foundations of Christianity in the film that related to the story was rushed or skipped out of the way and I believed was to get to the point quickly, yet most audiences prefer anticipation and coming to their own conclusionI had hoped this film would be one of the years best films and as great summer blockbuster. However it does not seem that way. From a readers view and watching the film I do believe many feel as I do about this film. As for those who have not read the book, I hope they enjoyed the film.Verdict:A great Cast of very experienced actors, yet could have been given larger roles. I enjoyed seeing the film and remembering my thoughts and feelings I had when reading the book. A good film for summer for those who love a murder mystery and conspiracy thriller. 6/10.",3,"Don't make a treasure hunt out of a mostly debated topic., 13 Oct 2007",1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,2509,"['Plot', 'murder', 'Louvre', 'clues', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'paintings', 'lead', 'discovery', 'religious', 'mystery', 'protected', 'secret', 'society', 'two', 'thousand', 'years', 'could', 'shake', 'foundations', 'ChristianityMy', 'Review', 'film', 'have', 'level', 'drama', 'mystery', 'genres', 'connected', 'thriller', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'twice', 'loving', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'read', 'film', 'feels', 'bit', 'rushed', 'one', 'drafted', 'film.As', 'started', 'reading', 'book', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'Published', 'enjoyed', 'tremendously', 'When', 'reading', 'felt', 'concepts', 'book', 'well', 'paced', 'story', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'cleverly', 'done', 'film', 'was', 'rushed', 'missed', 'key', 'points', 'coherent', 'story', 'personally', 'believe', 'were', 'necessary', 'when', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'long', 'First', '20-30mins', 'was', 'rushed', 'far', 'concerned', 'getting', 'chase', 'investigation', 'underway', 'stated', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Johnathan', 'Ross', 'program', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'had', 'made', ""'Action"", ""Thriller'.There"", 'are', 'many', 'good', 'performances', 'provided', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'especially', 'Paul', 'Bettanny', 'Silas', 'part', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'extrovert', 'book', 'yet', 'film', 'part', 'second', 'halve', 'end', 'film', 'character', 'was', ""'kept"", 'back', 'film.The', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'were', 'vague', 'yet', 'still', 'believe', 'very', 'much', 'essential', 'characters', 'made', 'character', 'more', 'developed', 'less', 'hollow', 'flashbacks', 'Silas', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'however', 'were', 'rushed', 'slightly', 'empty', 'not', 'giving', 'whole', 'picture', 'how', 'character', 'came', 'be.The', 'History', 'Christ', 'Foundations', 'Christianity', 'film', 'related', 'story', 'was', 'rushed', 'skipped', 'way', 'believed', 'was', 'get', 'point', 'quickly', 'yet', 'most', 'audiences', 'prefer', 'anticipation', 'coming', 'own', 'conclusionI', 'had', 'hoped', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'years', 'best', 'films', 'great', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'However', 'not', 'seem', 'way', 'readers', 'view', 'watching', 'film', 'do', 'believe', 'many', 'feel', 'do', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'hope', 'enjoyed', 'film.Verdict', 'great', 'Cast', 'very', 'experienced', 'actors', 'yet', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'larger', 'roles', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'film', 'remembering', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'had', 'when', 'reading', 'book', 'good', 'film', 'summer', 'who', 'love', 'murder', 'mystery', 'conspiracy', 'thriller', '6/10']",N/A

This film might not be like a good wine that improves with decades of aging or a good cheese that gets finer and finer with weeks and months of patient loving care in some cool cave or cellar. But this film is the most inevitable and unfathomable film of many years, just like the book it has grown out of. Don't ever try to see it in French. It has to be seen in English, that is to say in its multilingual version : English, French, Italian and Latin. It has to be appreciated in its shooting language to enjoy the subtle finesse of the contrasting accents of the actors and actresses. The French actors and actresses are nicely airing some kind of light French flavoring, while the Americans and English actors and actresses are mesmerising and hypnotising us with the two mid-Atlantic and British linguistic brothers, though avoiding the Scottish cousin that could have sprinkled the end with its gravelly roughness. You will enjoy the scenery : the Louvre of course, but also Westminster Abbey, Saint Sulpice's and Rosslyn Chapel, Place de la Concorde et various Triumph Arks (an allusion to the albino Noah's ark ?), the Eiffel Tower and Big Ben, the French police and their distant cousins from Scotland Yard, the nicely sectarian Opus Dei and the just as much sectarian anti-religious French spirit. You will let yourself dive and delve deep into the mysteries and the riddles, the enigmas and the secret codes, just for the fun of a nice apple that you will get at the end of the game and present to your teacher in divinities, Dan Brown or Tom Hanks who are benedictally brown nosing with us and maybe with the catholic church. You will discover a crypt under Rosslyn Chapel that the Saint Clair owners refuse to acknowledge. Maybe it does not exist. You will imagine a crypt under the Louvre's inverted pyramid that President Mitterrand secretly buried as a homage to the Merovingian kings, to Jesus Christ who has always inspired French politicians who are obviously sacrificing their many lives to the cross of politics, to the masonic pyramid of the famous greenback dreamt by Benjamin Franklin when he was strolling along the Seine river as the first US ambassador to Paris a couple of centuries ago. You will in your turn dream of Mary Magdalene, the chalice of a promise, Jesus Christ, the silice of a Passion, and Leonardo Da Vinci, the most ambiguous vision and smile of a Mona Lisa who has forever captivated the attention of the world's past present and future innumerable generations. You will probably never get an answer to all your questions but at least you will get the questions and be able to store them in the back of your mind, in some drawer in the portmanteau of your brain.

639781,ADVRSHBI35H97,B00005JOC9,"James Donovan ""movie lover""","[8, 12]","I really wanted to like this film. I read the book for the first time about four weeks ago and was drooling with anticipation for this film to be released. The previews for it looked fantastic, and with that cast and director, how could it go wrong? Well, it did. Ron Howard dropped the ball on this one. I won't go over the plot or characters since almost everyone has read the book; if you haven't read it, then you probably won't care. To start off with, a book with characters that are in no real way fleshed out (not a criticism by the way, just an observation) does not easily translate to film and no one involved felt the need to improve upon that. That's okay. The book was a popcorn book, just like this is a popcorn movie. So the actors can't truly be faulted if the characters they play fail to register much; in this story it's the story that is the real character. Almost all of the actors are terrific under any other circumstance. But here they're cast adrift. Jean Reno and Alfred Molina are two terrific character actors who simply have nothing to do. They're completely wasted and you almost feel bad for them. Paul Bettany makes a good Silas and makes you wish there was more of him. The great Ian McKellen makes the most of every scene he's in and almost makes up for the two leads. I think Audrey Tautou is a beautiful and talented actress, but she is completely lost in this.Which now brings me to Tom Hanks, who is one of the finest actors out there, and could conceivably play anything. But this might be the one instance where he's been miscast, and badly. His Robert Langdon bears little resemblance to the character in the book. Dan Brown's Langdon was a symbologist who literally saw symbols in just about anything, and had a borderline unheatlhy passion and enthusiasm for his work. One of the joys of the book was getting inside his head and seeing how his mind worked as he tried to decipher clues and puzzles. Tom Hanks displays none of this at all. His Langdon is dull and mopey and has about as much enthusiasm for his life's work as a janitor. He acts as though he just happened to fall into symbology and was too lazy to get out of it. And to add insult to injury, the screenwriter decided to make Langdon a sceptic of the whole Jesus/Mary Magdalene scenario, which was NOT in the book. Apprehensive, perhaps, but getting into a heated argument with Leigh Teabing over it was just wrong. Another bone-headed revision to the story was to have Sophie's grandfather become not her grandfather, but someone who took her in when her parents died and acted like her grandfather. This change was completely unnecessary and took away from Sophie's climactic reunion with her grandmother.(Her brother was alive too, but apparently left out of the script). A truly sweet and emotional ending of sorts that never materialized in the film, surprising considering Ron Howard directed it. A man known for being something of a softie and he blows it. Oh well.The film is never boring but it's never involving either, and suffers from lack of momentum. The book started off with a bang (literally) and never stopped to take a breath.

Ron Howard may religiously follow the text but the end result is a lifeless movie with the actors going through the motions but eliciting little energy in this mildy sacrareligious whodunit?I really don't know why the Catholic Church pitched such a fuss over The Da Vinci Code.  It is first and foremost entertainment.  Anyone who seriously takes the Priory of Sion or the tangled web of deceit that Dan Brown portrayed coming down through the ages needs to read a little more history on the subject.  Nevertheless, it is a compelling story and one that forces you to rethink the role of the church in obscuring the birth of Christ.Dan Brown was at his most compelling when exploring the role of the Sacred Feminine and how the imagined Merovingian line had been protected through the last two millennia by a secret order that apparently influenced popes and kings alike.  Brown casts Opus Dei in a sinister role which I guess is what raised hackles in the Church, moreso than the supposed bloodline of Christ, which has long ago been dismissed as the folly of a Frenchman, Pierre Plantard, who believed he was the descendant of Christ and the rightful heir to the throne of France.  He is the one who apparently concocted the Priory of Sion to give creedence to his claims,  You can read more about Plantard on wikipedia.But then that really isn't the point of the movie.  We are forced to follow our less than dynamic duo through a series of highly questionable and boring action scenes that ultimately lead them to the Rosslyn Chapel, where a resolution of sorts takes place.  I would have liked to have seen a little more of the Sacred Feminine come out in the movie, but it was too much about Professor Langdon and not enough about the role Sophie Neveu played in all this.Ron Howard should stick to ""Grinches"" and ""Beautiful Minds,"" as he clearly was not up to the task of delivering on the theme.  A movie is not supposed to be a literal interpretation of a novel, especially one as dubious as this one.  It is supposed to have fun with the theme, explore new opportunities and be entertaining.

Nonetheless it captured my interest for a while despite the complete lack of plausibility, and I liked some of the details (e.g. the bullet stopping the door from shutting).But fairly soon after Ian McKellan shows up things start bogging down.  McKellan's character is lively, but the backstory is heavy even without appearances by Alfred Molina and Paul Bettany's respective characters.  Numerous twists and turns keep occurring and the pace of the film began to crawl.  By the time of the denouement (which I found amusing, and not in a good way) I was checking my watch every 5 minutes or so.So the verdict?  A disappointing 2 stars out of 4.

I hated the book for its pretensions to depicting art, religion and history. Rob Howard dumbs down the puzzles and gums up the fast-moving plot with wooden actors, an incomprehensible storyline and a total lack of chemistry between the main characters. Silas, the murderous albino monk makes even less sense in the film than on the page. Tom Hanks does manage to breathe life into symbologist Langdon, but mostly by showing his limitations, which makes the superhuman requirements for breaking the codes less likely. Audrey Tautou speaks her lines with none of the life that made her a delight in Amelie. The codes, the neatest part of the book, are trimmed back to nearly nothing. Howard gives a nod to the controversy around the book by having Langdon and Teabing argue a little about the book's explosive conclusions. But the film's point -- that descendants of Jesus live on -- is blunted by the fact that he is claimed to have been a normal human being. So what's the big deal about his descendants, or the tomb of his supposed bride, if he was just some guy?Author Dan Brown's loosey-goosey approach to ""history"" is still in full view in the bonus material. In interviews, he claims that a rose in an alabaster jar, shown repeatedly throughout the film, is a symbol of Mary M. If so, it an awfully recent symbol, found nowhere but the movie.

Shouldn't there be thousands of descendants after all these years? How would the 2000 year old corpse prove anything? So what if Sophie is a descendant of Mary M.? We don't have Christ's DNA.

Movies such as this seem to be a great challenge for directors. This story been read by so many and I know the film is almost 2.5 hours long, but this could, and should have been a bit longer or expanded in the correct places. The first 200 pages of Dan Brown's book are adapted into about 20 minutes. All of the anagrams, the Fache (Jean Reno) stuff, investigating the crime scene. ALL of that goes by in an incredibly rushed 20 minutes. You have to give those 20 minutes your full, undivided attention or you'll miss important details. Langdon being Fache's number 1 suspect isn't the least bit surprising. You had just been introduced to both characters 2 minutes beforehand. The film finally decides to slow down and take it's time once we meet Ian Mckellen's character, Leigh Teabing. They should have added at least 30 minutes to the first 20 minutes, and probably put some of those extra minutes into the irksome flashy flashback sequences.The acting is pretty good. Tom Hanks has his weak points in the film, but he's given such little time to react to things, I don't blame him. He gets better as the film goes along. The same can be said about Audrey Tautou. If the film wasn't so swift, I'm sure they'd give great performances. Paul Bettany, Jean Reno, Ian Mckellen and Alfred Molina all gave good performance. I'm not surprised that Dan Brown had Jean Reno in mind for Fache when he was writing the book. Ian Mckellen is great as the lovable and humble old man, Teabing. In my opinion, he has the best lines in the film. And Paul Bettany stands out as the albino monk, Silas. I think he gave the best performance in the film.Ron Howard does a good job in the directing chair but if he hadn't rushed and gave more respect to the first 200 pages of Dan Brown's novel I'd probably give this film a higher rating.

Once I saw that **** review I thought many other reviews like that would follow. However I guess everyone else that gave it bad reviews are either overly Christian or have short attenion spans. Since some either complain about the length or the story itself. I even heard something about over-acting. Funny, I don't recall much over-acting here.There's also reviews about it be boring with too much talking. Sure it's  convenient that they can get out every single thing they wanna say about history unknown to mankind before they are in danger again. However the book was like that too. Plus I didn't find all the talking boring. It' is faithful to the book and if everything the book says wasn't explained, the people watching the film that didn't read the book would be lost.Besides listening to Ian McKellen talk in any movie isn't boring and of course it's not boring here either. Everything he says about Jesus may be silly and offending to some but....IT's FICTION!. People can be like ""oh no, tell me he didn't just say that"". When what is really so bad about what is being said ? I think it's selfish to just want to think that Jesus possibly couldn't of had a wife and kids and to totally be appauled by the thought. It doesn't make him any less special to me if it's true. Besides like I said...this is FICTION!, so hating the book and now the movie is the real silly thing. I think everyone that gave this bad reviews had it planned to hate it in the first place.Yes the screenplay is done by Akiva Goldsman who wrote the screenplay for Batman & Robin. So of course critics had to throw that in there and say the movie sucks because of that too. I too expected the film to suck once I learned that but come on, there's no Batman & Robin like dialogue in this film. Of course the guy that wrote Batman & Robin isn't as good of a writer as Dan Brown but he doesn't do a bad job bringing Brown's work to the big screen either. If you're mad that he chose to have all the talking from the book then that's silly too.The main characters are supposed to be talkers and brainy debators. While the actors play them how they should be played. This is a movie where you are supposed open your mind and heart and just think a little. If you want  a non-stop action summer movie, this isn't it but is it a bad summer movie ? No not at all. Is it a bad adaption of the Da Vinci Code ? No, it's everything it should be and Ron Howard is very faithful to the book and so are the actors. Newsday also called the film over-scored by Hans Zimmer , I couldn't disagree more. The score is wonderful and if the film wasn't soooo unfairly hated it would get  a best score nomination like it deserves. This is probably Ron Howards most unfairly hated film since Willow. While reading the book, the ending didn't do much for me but actually seeing it yourself, it's just beautiful and breathtaking and I loved it. So just give this film a chance and don't think it's your job of being a Christian to hate the film, just open your mind and sit back and relax.",4,Engaging and Interesting...FICTION!!!,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,3206,"['have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'bad', '1/2', 'even', 'one', 'star', 'movie', 'only', 'review', 'got', 'things', 'right', '****', 'review', 'saw', 'New', 'York', 'Post', 'Once', 'saw', '****', 'review', 'thought', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'would', 'follow', 'However', 'guess', 'everyone', 'else', 'gave', 'bad', 'reviews', 'are', 'overly', 'Christian', 'have', 'short', 'attenion', 'spans', 'complain', 'length', 'story', 'even', 'heard', 'something', 'over-acting', 'Funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'much', 'over-acting', 'here.There', 'also', 'be', 'boring', 'too', 'much', 'talking', 'Sure', 'convenient', 'can', 'get', 'out', 'single', 'thing', 'wan', 'na', 'say', 'history', 'unknown', 'mankind', 'are', 'danger', 'again', 'However', 'book', 'was', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'talking', 'boring', 'faithful', 'book', 'everything', 'book', 'was', ""n't"", 'explained', 'people', 'watching', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'lost.Besides', 'listening', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'talk', 'movie', ""n't"", 'boring', 'course', 'not', 'boring', 'here', 'either', 'Everything', 'Jesus', 'may', 'be', 'silly', 'offending', '.IT', 'FICTION', 'People', 'can', 'be', 'oh', 'tell', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'say', 'When', 'what', 'really', 'so', 'bad', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'selfish', 'just', 'want', 'think', 'Jesus', 'possibly', 'could', ""n't"", 'had', 'wife', 'kids', 'totally', 'be', 'appauled', 'thought', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'special', 'true', 'said', 'FICTION', 'hating', 'book', 'now', 'movie', 'real', 'silly', 'thing', 'think', 'everyone', 'gave', 'bad', 'reviews', 'had', 'planned', 'hate', 'first', 'screenplay', 'done', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'So', 'course', 'critics', 'had', 'throw', 'say', 'movie', 'too', 'too', 'expected', 'film', 'suck', 'once', 'learned', 'come', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'dialogue', 'film', 'course', 'guy', 'wrote', 'Batman', 'Robin', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'writer', 'Dan', 'Brown', ""n't"", 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'bringing', 'Brown', 'work', 'big', 'screen', 'either', ""'re"", 'mad', 'chose', 'have', 'talking', 'book', 'then', 'silly', 'too.The', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'talkers', 'brainy', 'debators', 'actors', 'play', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'played', 'movie', 'where', 'are', 'supposed', 'open', 'mind', 'heart', 'just', 'think', 'little', 'want', 'non-stop', 'action', 'summer', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'summer', 'movie', 'No', 'not', 'bad', 'adaption', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'No', 'everything', 'should', 'be', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'very', 'faithful', 'book', 'so', 'are', 'actors', 'Newsday', 'also', 'called', 'film', 'over-scored', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'could', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'more', 'score', 'wonderful', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'soooo', 'unfairly', 'hated', 'would', 'get', 'best', 'score', 'nomination', 'probably', 'Ron', 'Howards', 'most', 'unfairly', 'hated', 'film', 'Willow', 'reading', 'book', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'actually', 'seeing', 'just', 'beautiful', 'breathtaking', 'loved', 'So', 'just', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'job', 'being', 'Christian', 'hate', 'film', 'just', 'open', 'mind', 'sit', 'back', 'relax']",N/A

Unfortunately, even they could not save The Da Vinci Code from its shortcomings.In fairness, there are so many things important to know in order to follow the plot that to include what was missing would have added at least another hour to an already long film. Unfortunately for The Da Vinci Code, in order to adapt it to film, keep it at a reasonable length and honestly show the clues that lead to the conclusion, some aspects of the subplot, which would have given better understanding to character, had to be sacrificed. It's a tribute to Akiva Goldsman's skill that he was able to write the script he did.The film includes a fantastic cast led by Tom Hanks in the lead role of Robert Langdon and Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, on the run from police while solving the mystery left in the aftermath of a murder in The Louve. Jean Reno is suitably cryptic as Bezu Fache, leading the team chasing after Langdon and Neveu while Ian McKellen is inspiring as Leigh Teabing. In additional, Paul Bettany is chilling as Silas and Alfred Molina is wonderful as the mysterious Cardinal Aringarosa.Ron Howard's direction is superb, as expected. Much of the film takes place at night, adding to the mystery and beauty of the art and locations.

639809,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B00005JOC9,John Kwok,"[4, 6]","Not having read Dan Brown's novel ""The Da Vinci Code"", I had few expectations for this film, ignoring much of the controversy surrounding both the novel and the film. I'm surprised that ""The Da Vinci Code"" has garnered many poor reviews, since it may be the best film - and without a doubt, the best thriller - made by director Ron Howard. Distinguished screenwriter Akiva Goldsman has also written a superb script which apparently adheres closely to the original novel's tale, but with a more exciting, and better, ending. I was most impressed with the film's pacing, with splendid acting from the cast, including Tom Hanks as Harvard professor Robert Langdon. Noted young French actress Audrey Tautou gives a splendid performance as French cryptologist Sophie Neveu. Other memorable performances include those by veteran French actor Jean Reno as Paris Police Captain Fache, popular young English actor Paul Bettany as Silas, the murderous albino monk, and acclaimed German actor Jurgen Prochnow as the slippery Swiss banker Andr&eacute; Vernet. I was also delighted to see Alfred Molina play yet another fascinating villain as Bishop Aringarosa. But some of the most thrilling scenes are those that include acclaimed British actor Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, who plays a most important role in the unfolding quest led by Langdon and Neveu in search of The Holy Grail. I found ""The Da Vinci Code"" as exciting as some of the best in the ""James Bond"" series featuring actor Sean Connery as James Bond; the film itself had nonstop excitement and intrigue, with rarely a dull moment, inspite of its long running time.Many critics of the film have suggested that it tends to be too talkative, allegedly slowing down the film's pace. I strongly disagree, since I found ""The Da Vinci Code"" a fascinating, intelligent, and rather exciting thriller, which kept me at the edge of my seat when I saw the film earlier today. Other critics have been those who have objected to the film's portrayal of the fundamentalist Roman Catholic sect Opus Dei, but this thoughtful criticism should be aimed instead at author Dan Brown, the novel's writer (It's a criticism that I am somewhat in agreement with, since I found almost incredible, the character of Silas, the murderous monk, even if he was portrayed brilliantly by actor Paul Bettany.). Despite these criticisms, I still think that diehard fans of Dan Brown's novel - and those like myself who haven't read it - will enjoy ""The Da Vinci Code"" as a gripping cinematic thriller. Without a doubt, Ron Howard's newest film should be regarded as one of the best films to see in theaters during the summer of 2006.",5,"Splendid Thriller Courtesy of Director Ron Howard, Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and a Fine Cast",1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,2656,"['Not', 'having', 'read', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'novel', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'had', 'few', 'expectations', 'film', 'ignoring', 'much', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'novel', 'film', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'garnered', 'many', 'poor', 'reviews', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'doubt', 'best', 'thriller', 'made', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Distinguished', 'screenwriter', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'also', 'written', 'superb', 'script', 'apparently', 'closely', 'original', 'novel', 'tale', 'more', 'exciting', 'better', 'ending', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'film', 'pacing', 'splendid', 'acting', 'cast', 'including', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Harvard', 'professor', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'Noted', 'young', 'French', 'actress', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'splendid', 'performance', 'French', 'cryptologist', 'Sophie', 'Neveu', 'Other', 'memorable', 'performances', 'include', 'veteran', 'French', 'actor', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Paris', 'Police', 'Captain', 'Fache', 'popular', 'young', 'English', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Silas', 'murderous', 'albino', 'monk', 'acclaimed', 'German', 'actor', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'slippery', 'Swiss', 'banker', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Vernet', 'was', 'also', 'delighted', 'see', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'play', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'villain', 'Bishop', 'Aringarosa', 'most', 'thrilling', 'scenes', 'are', 'include', 'acclaimed', 'British', 'actor', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Sir', 'Leigh', 'Teabing', 'who', 'most', 'important', 'role', 'unfolding', 'quest', 'led', 'Langdon', 'Neveu', 'search', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'found', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'as', 'exciting', 'best', 'James', 'Bond', 'series', 'featuring', 'actor', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'had', 'nonstop', 'excitement', 'intrigue', 'rarely', 'dull', 'moment', 'inspite', 'long', 'running', 'time.Many', 'critics', 'film', 'have', 'suggested', 'be', 'too', 'talkative', 'allegedly', 'slowing', 'down', 'film', 'pace', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'found', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'fascinating', 'intelligent', 'rather', 'exciting', 'thriller', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'earlier', 'today', 'Other', 'critics', 'have', 'been', 'who', 'have', 'objected', 'film', 'portrayal', 'fundamentalist', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'sect', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'thoughtful', 'criticism', 'should', 'be', 'aimed', 'instead', 'author', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'novel', 'writer', 'criticism', 'am', 'somewhat', 'agreement', 'found', 'almost', 'incredible', 'character', 'Silas', 'murderous', 'monk', 'even', 'was', 'portrayed', 'brilliantly', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Bettany.', 'criticisms', 'still', 'think', 'diehard', 'fans', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'novel', 'like', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'gripping', 'cinematic', 'thriller', 'doubt', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'newest', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'regarded', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'see', 'theaters', 'summer', '2006']",N/A

To me, Dan Brown's tale is just meant to be a thinking person's roller coaster ride, and a kind of thoughtful ""what if...?""  The author wasn't purporting to write non-fiction, just a great campfire tale that takes many age-old theories, rumors and (to many) beliefs and run with them to great effect.With all its intentionally shocking ideas, I enjoyed the playful subversion of the book, so I was initially a little diappointed that the movie version pulls back from these ideas a little, primarily by making the Robert Langdon character more of a skeptic and defender of the status quo than he was in the book.  But, in the end, this worked out, as skeptics get to enjoy the movie a little more because their own positions are represented in the film, and- when the subversive stuff eventually does hit- it has more of an impact.Some critics also derided the film simply on the basis of its acting, pacing, etc.  But, I don't know... with all its mysteries, clues, chases, confrontations, and revelations, I think the movie is plenty entertaining, exciting and suspenseful.

639818,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005JOC9,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 7]","I'm probably one of the few people in America who haven't read Dan Brown's novel ""The Da Vinci Code."" The novel was a bestseller for, at least, a couple of years and I knew when I saw the book riding high on the bestseller list that a movie was inevitable. I gave up on going to read the book when I heard about the movie. After all, the movie had to be good. It starred two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks and French actress Audrey Tatou ('Amelie'), was directed by Oscar winner Ron Howard, and written by Oscar winner Akiva Goldsman. The movie came out and something strange happened. It got lukewarm reviews from critics and, judging by the reviews on Amazon, people don't like the movie much either. Keeping in mind that I've never read the book, I don't know how it holds up to the movie...But I got to say. I liked this movie, it's not perfect. But it's pretty good. The movie stars Hanks as Professor Robert Langdon, an expert on symbols. While doing what appears to be a book signing in France, he's brought into a gallery to identify symbols that have been carved into a murdered man's body. The man is Jacques Sauniere, a man Langdon was scheduled to have a drink with that very day. The murder scene is a bit strange, since Sauniere was shot and carved the symbols into his body himself. While Langdon is questioned by Captain Fache (Jean Reno), a young woman named Sophie Neveu (Tatou) arrives and warns Langdon that he's the suspect in the murder of Sauniere. The man who happens to be her grandfather. As they scramble for clues, they find a message from Sauniere that fuels the rest of the movie. A lot of the stuff that occurs later in this movie would be considered a ""twist"" in most films, but due to all the controversy surrounding it's subject, everyone knows what's happening. As you know, Langdon and Sophie are looking for the Holy Grail which is not, as rumored, a cup...It's a person. The spawn of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Standing in their way is a murderous albino rabbi named Silas (an evil-looking Paul Bettany, in one of his best performances) and an Opus Dei bishop (Alfred Molina, 'Spider-Man 2'). Also helping Langdon and Sophie in their search is Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen, who's great here), a cripple who's an expert on all things religious. This movie has caused controversy for everything. The fact that it contradicts religion, the fact that an albino is the villain, the fact that Opus Dei is portrayed incorrectly. What people don't realize is that Dan Brown was not writing a history novel and Ron Howard is not making a non-fiction film. This movie is meant to be pure fiction, existing solely for the purpose of entertaining the masses. As for entertainment value, The Da Vinci Code has its highs and lows. It can be very entertaining one moment and seem never-ending the next. I was impressed by how much research went into the writing of this stuff. Even though it's fiction, it seems thoroughly researched. The performances are strong, the action scenes are well filmed, and the movie has great cinematography and art direction. I don't think we'll see it mentioned come Oscar time, but it's a nice thought-provoking way to pass the time.GRADE: B-",4,The Da Vinci Code,1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,3193,"[""'m"", 'probably', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'America', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'novel', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'novel', 'was', 'bestseller', 'least', 'couple', 'years', 'knew', 'when', 'saw', 'book', 'riding', 'high', 'bestseller', 'list', 'movie', 'was', 'inevitable', 'gave', 'up', 'going', 'read', 'book', 'when', 'heard', 'movie', 'movie', 'had', 'be', 'good', 'starred', 'two-time', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'French', 'actress', 'Audrey', 'Tatou', ""'Amelie"", 'was', 'directed', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'written', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'something', 'strange', 'happened', 'got', 'lukewarm', 'reviews', 'critics', 'judging', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'much', 'Keeping', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'got', 'say', 'liked', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'Hanks', 'Professor', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'expert', 'symbols', 'doing', 'what', 'be', 'book', 'signing', 'France', 'brought', 'gallery', 'identify', 'symbols', 'have', 'been', 'carved', 'murdered', 'man', 'body', 'man', 'Jacques', 'Sauniere', 'man', 'Langdon', 'was', 'scheduled', 'have', 'drink', 'very', 'day', 'murder', 'scene', 'bit', 'strange', 'Sauniere', 'was', 'shot', 'carved', 'symbols', 'body', 'Langdon', 'questioned', 'Captain', 'Fache', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Sophie', 'Neveu', 'Tatou', 'Langdon', 'suspect', 'murder', 'Sauniere', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'grandfather', 'scramble', 'clues', 'find', 'message', 'Sauniere', 'rest', 'movie', 'lot', 'stuff', 'later', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'twist', 'most', 'films', 'due', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'subject', 'everyone', 'what', 'happening', 'know', 'Langdon', 'Sophie', 'are', 'looking', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'not', 'rumored', 'cup', 'person', 'spawn', 'Jesus', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'Standing', 'way', 'murderous', 'albino', 'rabbi', 'named', 'Silas', 'evil-looking', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'bishop', 'Alfred', 'Molina', ""'Spider-Man"", '2', 'Also', 'helping', 'Langdon', 'Sophie', 'search', 'Leigh', 'Teabing', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'who', 'great', 'here', 'cripple', 'who', 'expert', 'things', 'religious', 'movie', 'caused', 'controversy', 'everything', 'fact', 'religion', 'fact', 'albino', 'villain', 'fact', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'portrayed', 'incorrectly', 'What', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'was', 'not', 'writing', 'history', 'novel', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'not', 'making', 'non-fiction', 'film', 'movie', 'meant', 'be', 'pure', 'fiction', 'existing', 'solely', 'purpose', 'entertaining', 'masses', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'highs', 'lows', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'one', 'moment', 'seem', 'never-ending', 'next', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'much', 'research', 'went', 'writing', 'stuff', 'Even', 'fiction', 'thoroughly', 'researched', 'performances', 'are', 'strong', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'filmed', 'movie', 'great', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'see', 'mentioned', 'come', 'Oscar', 'time', 'nice', 'thought-provoking', 'way', 'pass', 'time.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A

When you're reading through the fast paced car chases and Indiana Jones like romp through history, you think to yourself, ""This has `Hollywood Movie Script' written all over it."" But when you actually watch the movie, it feels remarkably like you're reading a book. Yet one more example of a story that, for one reason or another, didn't survive the jump between mediums very well.Although it is tempting to say that Ron Howard really mucked this up, I'm not sure how well the story would have fared with a different director. Although the book at first glance might seem to be the perfect Hollywood movie, on further reflection this probably would have been a difficult transition in any case. The success of Indiana Jones and his ilk is based upon the fact that they are action/adventure movies with a bit of history thrown in for flavor. ""The Davinci Code"" is essentially a historical thesis, with some action thrown in to make it an interesting novel. But there's just too much information in the book to pack into a Hollywood movie.  Anyone who hadn't read the book would be left confused about what was going on, and yet the movie already seems terribly long and talky as it is. I thought it was one of the longest 2 1/2 hours I ever sat through.There has already been much discussion about the accuracy of this book (to put it mildly) and how much of this Dan Brown can get away with in the fictional genre. I don't approach this book with any sort of religious axe to grind, but at the same time I don't particularly like being lied to. Which was my main criticism of ""The Davinci Code."" I do realize its fiction, but I would have felt a little better about the whole thing if the author had been upfront about it.However when this turns into a big budget Hollywood movie, all bets are off. I don't expect it true, and I don't care if it's true. I just want to watch something interesting. If I wanted to actually learn about the knights Templars, I'd read a book or rent a documentary.And this I think is the second big problem with this story in the film medium. I'm not saying Hollywood films shouldn't be educational. Hollywood does some great history bi-opics, but they do it by actually showing the life. The kind of talking heads in ""The Davinci Code"" is not why people go to the movies.In short, this film may represent another example of ""The Last Temptation of Jesus Christ"" phenomenon. It's a mediocre film that would probably have faded quietly away, if the religious right hadn't made such a big deal of protesting it.",2,A rough transistion from book to movie,1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,2573,"['funny', 'thing', 'DaVinci', 'Code', 'When', ""'re"", 'reading', 'fast', 'paced', 'car', 'chases', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'romp', 'history', 'think', 'yourself', 'Hollywood', 'Movie', 'Script', 'written', 'when', 'actually', 'watch', 'movie', 'remarkably', ""'re"", 'reading', 'book', 'one', 'more', 'example', 'story', 'one', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'survive', 'jump', 'mediums', 'very', 'tempting', 'say', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'really', 'mucked', 'up', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'well', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'fared', 'different', 'director', 'book', 'first', 'glance', 'might', 'seem', 'be', 'perfect', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'further', 'reflection', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'transition', 'case', 'success', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'ilk', 'based', 'fact', 'are', 'action/adventure', 'movies', 'bit', 'history', 'thrown', 'flavor', 'Davinci', 'Code', 'essentially', 'historical', 'thesis', 'action', 'thrown', 'make', 'interesting', 'novel', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'book', 'pack', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'Anyone', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'confused', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'yet', 'movie', 'already', 'terribly', 'long', 'talky', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'longest', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'ever', 'sat', 'already', 'been', 'much', 'discussion', 'accuracy', 'book', 'put', 'mildly', 'how', 'much', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'fictional', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'approach', 'book', 'sort', 'religious', 'axe', 'grind', 'same', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'being', 'lied', 'Which', 'was', 'main', 'criticism', 'Davinci', 'Code', 'do', 'realize', 'fiction', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'little', 'better', 'whole', 'thing', 'author', 'had', 'been', 'upfront', 'it.However', 'when', 'big', 'budget', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'bets', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'true', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'something', 'interesting', 'wanted', 'actually', 'learn', 'knights', 'Templars', ""'d"", 'read', 'book', 'rent', 'documentary.And', 'think', 'second', 'big', 'problem', 'story', 'film', 'medium', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'educational', 'Hollywood', 'great', 'history', 'bi-opics', 'do', 'actually', 'showing', 'life', 'kind', 'talking', 'heads', 'Davinci', 'Code', 'not', 'why', 'people', 'go', 'movies.In', 'short', 'film', 'may', 'represent', 'example', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'phenomenon', 'mediocre', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'faded', 'quietly', 'away', 'religious', 'right', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'big', 'deal', 'protesting']",N/A

I am unsure as to why this is, though I have my theories, but irregardless of how offensive the subject matter of some religious thrillers may be to certain groups, Hollywood can't help but release more and more semi-blasphemous or full-out blasphemous material.  Now, as a Christian I can still watch these movies, viewing them for what they are, fiction, plus my faith is strong enough to not be shaken by any work of fiction.  So, when I heard that Ron Howard (director of ""Apollo 13"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"") would be directing an adaptation of Dan Brown's best-selling novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" and the film would star Tom Hanks (""Castaway"" and ""Forrest Gump""), I was intrigued since I am a fan of both the director and the star.  I had heard about the controversy surrounding this movie and the novel that inspired it, but I had heard from other movie-goers that this adaptation steered away from the more blasphemous material from the novel, and presented a more balanced view of the theory that Jesus was married to Mary Magdelene and may have sired a child (again this is a theory, and one I do not believe is true in any way).  I have to admit that even though I heard this movie would possibly be blasphemous, I wanted to watch it and see for myself, plus in truth, I have been a fan of numerous movies that weren't exactly faithful in their depictions of Christianity or Catholicism, I was able to view them as works of fiction and enjoy them; examples would be ""End of Days"" and ""Constantine"".  The question is however, can I do it for this movie, knowing that the intention of the author, Dan Brown, was to try to disrupt people's faith in God by presenting this theory that is not even remotely supported by any real evidence, merely a painting done by Leonardo Da Vinci serves as the only basis for the theory.""The Da Vinci Code"" follows a Harvard Professor of Symbology named Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) who has been summoned to the Louvre to decode a bizarre series of clues at a murder scene.  When Langdon arrives he is warned that he is the primary suspect in the murder, and is then aided by a Cryptologist named Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou).  With French police tracking their every movements, Robert and Audrey are trying desperately to survive and still unravel the ever-expanding mystery surrounding the murder.  A mystery that involves a secret from the time of Jesus, that if proven true could shatter the very faith of Christianity.For some reason, even though this was a high-profile movie for Hollywood due to its subject matter, critics blasted the movie, as basically being too self-important, poorly acted and executed, and just completely boring.  This came as a shock to me, because critics love movies that blast religion, and the religious thrillers that critics hate, I generally love because that means they're not as one sided as the critics had hoped.  So with that thought, I was even more excited to see ""The Da Vinci Code"", and see what all of the fuss was about.  Well, I have to say that I have to agree with the critics on this movie, not completely, but mostly.I felt the movie tried to hard to be such an 'important' movie, especially in the last half hour, that it really brings the movie to a screeching halt.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2 hours of ""The Da Vinci Code"", but once the murder/mystery aspect of the movie was wrapped up, which by the way would have been a perfect stopping point and would have provided a much stronger movie, but the last half hour completely ruined the movie experience for me.  Over the course of the first 2 hours the theory of Christ having a wife was presented, but evidence refuting the theory was also presented, both sides getting equal share, which was interesting to watch, but in the last half hour only the theory is given screen time and the movie veers heavily into the blasphemy arena.  As far as the actors performances were concerned, I thought that both lead actors, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou, did excellent jobs in their respective roles.  The true star of the movie was Sir Ian McKellan's character, which most critics agree with me on that statement, he was really enjoying his role in the movie, and the scenes with him and Tom Hanks arguing back and forth over the validity of the theory were a joy to witness.  I felt the directing was solid, which is no surprise since Ron Howard was at the helm, and from what I hear, it was his decision to tone down the more blasphemous parts from the novel and present a more balanced perspective.  The way Ron Howard chose to portray Robert's ability to decipher code was interesting, yet very reminiscient of the way Russell Crowe's character understood numbers in Ron's earlier work ""A Beautiful Mind"", which made me kind of let down that he wasn't more original and chose to copy himself.Overall, I enjoyed the majority of this movie, the last half hour was especially weak and ruined the movie for me.  I do believe the movie is worth watching once, especially the entertaining first 2 hours, but after the movie wrapped with the dismally boring final 30 minutes, I did feel as if I had wasted my time, and would have enjoyed it much more if the movie would have ended with the conclusion of the murder mystery.""The Da Vinci Code"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief nudity.",3,"Seek the

639828,A2CYWBJ4I0VHJX,B00005JOC9,"kalebsmom ""kalebsmom""","[5, 9]","I'd read most of the extreme negative reviews before going to see this movie.  I must admit that despite my belief that most of them were ""created"" as a way of dragging down the overall rating in an effort to keep people from going to see the movie, it did cause me to lower my expectations for the movie.  And for this, I am profoundly grateful!  So, to all those who cannot spell and have no concept of grammar, punctuation or syntax, and felt the need to artificially lower the rating for this movie in a misguided attempt to keep people from seeing it: THANK YOU for actually making this movie MORE enjoyable for me than it otherwise would have been!Why?Simple.  The movie is not as good as the book.  Not even close.  Originally, because I really enjoyed the book, I had very, very high expectations for the movie.  Had I walked into the theater with those high expectations still in place, I would have been profoundly disappointed.  But thanks to those that helped to lower my expectations, I found myself enjoying this movie not for what I wanted it to be, expected it to be, or hoped it would be, but for what it actually is.Again, this movie is NOT the book.  Please don't judge it by, or against, the book.  The book has a lot more detail.  If the movie contained all the details of the book, it would be at least 24 hours long, and while that would work for a miniseries (or rather, an entire season of a TV series), it would be catastrophic in a theater setting.  I think they did manage to touch on most of the important points, even though some aspects were barely mentioned and other glossed over.  Even so, I believe character development suffered most of all...unfortunately.If I had never read the book, I would probably have left the theater wondering what was so controversial that people are actually protesting this movie.  The BOOK makes for compelling evidence that Jesus was married and created a bloodline.  The MOVIE has absolutely NO ""evidence"", just supposition...and not very clearly defined supposition, at that.(Ever since I was a child, I thought it odd that Jesus did not marry and have children, so His descendants could still be on earth, so even if there was REAL proof that this had happened, I would not be horrified, and my faith would not come crashing down around me.  Jesus lived His life in a body mortal in every way, including having the ability to suffer and die, so why would He not feel compelled to marry and have children?  And why, since He came to us in a mortal body, should we be threatened by the idea that He might have married and had children?  Getting married and having children is not, after all, a sin.  It's what God actually expects us to do!  Just look at all the ""begats"" in the bible, for example!  And if getting married was a sin, then the ministers and the priests and the rabbis that are helping these couples to ""sin"" are just as guilty, are they not?)I missed a lot of the character development from the book.  I missed the details, particularly concerning the various aspects of Leonardo's art (which, of course, made me run for my computer to look at each piece of art as if I'd never seen it before...and caused me to faithfully watch every TV show that has touched on the various aspects brought up by his book).  I was rather unhappy with some of the changes, particularly near the end (primarily concerning Sophie's family), and the ""little jokes"" about walking on water and water into wine were, in my opinion, in unnecessarily bad taste, but the audience seemed to find both amusing, so go figure.I would have given this movie four stars, but because I honestly believe most of the early reviews were ""made up"" to artificially lower the overall rating, I've given it five stars.  And honestly, if judged on it's own merits, for what it is, this movie probably is closer to five stars than four.  I think if I had never read the book, or if I'd read it years ago, I'd have liked this movie more, not less.  It's only when compared with the book that it suffers so badly...imho.In the meantime, to those who are protesting the book and the movie, I have this to say: Your protests are probably helping the success of both, in the long run.  It was the controversy that caused me to read the book in the first place, as it happens.  And if your faith is strong, why do you feel threatened?  And finally, as I already mentioned, why would it make Jesus any less of a Savior if He had been married and fathered a child?  GOD had a child...Jesus!  Why could JESUS not have a child?",5,Don't Judge a Movie By the Book,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,4558,"[""'d"", 'read', 'most', 'extreme', 'negative', 'reviews', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'must', 'admit', 'belief', 'most', 'were', 'created', 'way', 'dragging', 'down', 'overall', 'rating', 'effort', 'keep', 'people', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'did', 'cause', 'lower', 'expectations', 'movie', 'am', 'profoundly', 'grateful', 'So', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'spell', 'have', 'concept', 'grammar', 'punctuation', 'syntax', 'felt', 'need', 'artificially', 'lower', 'rating', 'movie', 'misguided', 'attempt', 'keep', 'people', 'seeing', 'THANK', 'YOU', 'actually', 'making', 'movie', 'MORE', 'enjoyable', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Why', 'Simple', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'Not', 'even', 'close', 'Originally', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'book', 'had', 'very', 'very', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'Had', 'walked', 'theater', 'high', 'expectations', 'still', 'place', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'profoundly', 'disappointed', 'thanks', 'helped', 'lower', 'expectations', 'found', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'expected', 'be', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'actually', 'is.Again', 'movie', 'NOT', 'book', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'book', 'lot', 'more', 'detail', 'movie', 'contained', 'details', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'least', '24', 'hours', 'long', 'would', 'work', 'miniseries', 'rather', 'entire', 'season', 'TV', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'catastrophic', 'theater', 'setting', 'think', 'did', 'manage', 'touch', 'most', 'important', 'points', 'even', 'aspects', 'were', 'barely', 'mentioned', 'other', 'glossed', 'Even', 'so', 'believe', 'character', 'development', 'suffered', 'most', 'unfortunately.If', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'left', 'theater', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'controversial', 'people', 'are', 'actually', 'protesting', 'movie', 'BOOK', 'compelling', 'evidence', 'Jesus', 'was', 'married', 'created', 'bloodline', 'MOVIE', 'absolutely', 'NO', 'evidence', 'just', 'supposition', 'not', 'very', 'clearly', 'defined', 'supposition', 'was', 'child', 'thought', 'Jesus', 'did', 'not', 'marry', 'have', 'children', 'descendants', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'earth', 'so', 'even', 'was', 'REAL', 'proof', 'had', 'happened', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'horrified', 'faith', 'would', 'not', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'Jesus', 'lived', 'life', 'body', 'mortal', 'way', 'including', 'having', 'ability', 'suffer', 'die', 'why', 'would', 'not', 'feel', 'compelled', 'marry', 'have', 'children', 'why', 'came', 'mortal', 'body', 'should', 'be', 'threatened', 'idea', 'might', 'have', 'married', 'had', 'children', 'Getting', 'married', 'having', 'children', 'not', 'sin', 'what', 'God', 'actually', 'do', 'Just', 'look', 'begats', 'bible', 'example', 'getting', 'married', 'was', 'sin', 'then', 'ministers', 'priests', 'rabbis', 'are', 'helping', 'couples', 'sin', 'are', 'just', 'guilty', 'are', 'not', 'missed', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'book', 'missed', 'details', 'particularly', 'concerning', 'various', 'aspects', 'Leonardo', 'art', 'course', 'made', 'run', 'computer', 'look', 'piece', 'art', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'caused', 'faithfully', 'watch', 'TV', 'show', 'touched', 'various', 'aspects', 'brought', 'up', 'book', 'was', 'rather', 'unhappy', 'changes', 'particularly', 'end', 'primarily', 'concerning', 'Sophie', 'family', 'little', 'jokes', 'walking', 'water', 'water', 'wine', 'were', 'opinion', 'unnecessarily', 'bad', 'taste', 'audience', 'seemed', 'find', 'amusing', 'so', 'go', 'figure.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'honestly', 'believe', 'most', 'early', 'reviews', 'were', 'made', 'up', 'artificially', 'lower', 'overall', 'rating', ""'ve"", 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'honestly', 'judged', 'own', 'merits', 'what', 'movie', 'probably', 'closer', 'five', 'stars', 'four', 'think', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'book', ""'d"", 'read', 'years', 'ago', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'more', 'not', 'less', 'only', 'when', 'compared', 'book', 'so', 'badly', 'meantime', 'who', 'are', 'protesting', 'book', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'protests', 'are', 'probably', 'helping', 'success', 'long', 'run', 'was', 'controversy', 'caused', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'place', 'faith', 'strong', 'why', 'do', 'feel', 'threatened', 'finally', 'already', 'mentioned', 'why', 'would', 'make', 'Jesus', 'less', 'Savior', 'had', 'been', 'married', 'fathered', 'child', 'GOD', 'had', 'child', 'Jesus', 'Why', 'could', 'JESUS', 'not', 'have', 'child']",N/A

On one level it is a fast-paced thriller which, in a quite entertaining manner, depicts many  different people in search of the same goal, Dan Brown's version of the Holy Grail.

639831,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,B00005JOC9,- Kasia S.,"[3, 9]","Having the pleasure to finally see the movie soon after reading the book was quite a tasty experience for someone who likes good books and nice movies. Last week I also had the pleasure in purchasing the soundtrack, and upon listening I felt almost trained enough to finally watch the movie, in what I call the preferred order: first I read the book, then listen to the score and then savor the movie.I will have to agree that certain key parts had to be squandered or sped up to fit the 500 page story into a movie that didn't cause an embolism; a blot clot form sitting too long. For that purpose I must say that reading the book filled my nooks and crannies of any doubts and lack of information the movie might have left out, but as I say the movie can stand solid on the ground with its own right, for those who do not wish to read the book.Before I read Da Vinci Code I heard that Tom Hanks will be cast as Robert Langdon, and I must say I was pleased with the choice and pleasantly surprised how a character who plays well in romantic comedies  and war movies pulled out such a human, caring, intelligent and attention absorbing role. Tom was a great Robert Langdon, walking through the pages as I read the book with him in mind, solving world's oldest puzzles, traveling form continent to continent and back to search out in the name of science what he believed in. I think all the main characters such as sweet yet strong Tautou, Reno played Fache right on, Bettany's Silas was haunted yet you couldn't stop looking at him, Aflried Molina as brief as his role, was very good and of course Ian McKellen as Teabing almost stole the whole show! But I must say, that Langdon stood very strongly in front of my eyes on the big screen and  he was transformed through the role into a real scholar, a truth seeker traveling with Sophie at his side, forming a bond of more than friendship; a run for his and her life on a quest to find the Grail. And for those who did not read the book, the movie does a great job of setting up the guilty suspect because there are some bad guys in this movie and half the fun on the trail of the Grail is figuring who they are and what exactly IS the grail. .I thought the movie followed main plot very closely, it even kept the jokes and historical references right on point in order to enrich the experience.

639834,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00005JOC9,Kaya Savas,"[7, 8]","MOVIE: One of the most anticipated film projects in the last few years finally hits the big screen and comes flying out the gate. The Da Vinci Code had a huge opening weekend and earned $77 million, it also made film history by having the largest worldwide gross on opening weekend for any film ever made. Worldwide, the film grossed a massive $224 million against a budget of only $125 million in only 3 days. This is huge, so apparently all the negative reviews did not stop movie goers. Why did this film get trashed the way it did? It absolutely blows my mind that Poseidon has better reviews on Rotten Tomatoes than this film. Ron Howard provides a constant direction for the film and it never really gets off track. I found myself completely engrossed in the plot. It must have been a daunting task given that the book itself has sold over 60 million copies, and there is a huge fanbase awaiting this film. I have not read the book, but I know a few people who did and they all enjoyed the film and said it was a very faithful adaptation. Akiva Goldsman's screenplay was focused and very detailed even though some of the dialogue did make the film slip into melodrama in a few places. The movie was not necessarily thrilling, but it was very interesting and it always held my attention. A lot of people complained about its length, but never once in my mind when I was seeing it did I think that it started to drag. The film is really about this one man's personal journey through this entire ordeal. I could go into detail about the religious aspect of the film, but I won't because I think when people argue about religion it makes both sides of the argument look stupid. All the controversial stuff aside, this is a well made and very detailed film. It has great complex characters with lots of details within the plot with lots of historical references. When you get down to the basics of this movie, it's really nothing more than a hunt for the holy grail. I found it to be a great entertaining experience. There were a few editing choices that I was not fond of, some of the flashbacks were not handled well. Overall, it was a great hero's journey that comes full circle at the end.  I have to admit though, the film would have been incredibly dull if it weren't for Hans Zimmer's amazing score. Even though Hans Zimmer is my favorite composer, this is not a biased statement. For those who have seen the film, try and imagine the end sequence where the final revelation is revealed without the music. Lots of the scenes were heavily dependent on music and Hans Zimmer delivered an amazing score. There were some truly breathtaking cues in his score, and in the end the film was saved by the music.ACTING: I found the casting for this film to be perfect. Tom Hanks was a perfect fit for Robert Langdon in my opinion. He holds that intelligent poise that a brilliant professor would have. Audrey Tautou overacts just a tad bit at times, but then again one could blame the script's melodramatic dialogue. Ian McKellen is brilliant as Sir Leigh and at times steals the show. Other supporting work comes from Paul Bettany and Jean Reno. Bettany was terrific as Silas the albino monk and he really made him a dynamic character. At times he looked exactly like Ralph Fiennes from Red Dragon, just an observation that's all. Jean Reno was also geat as the detective who actually played the role that Dan Brown based on him. Dan Brown admitted that he wrote Reno's character with him in mind. Overall the cast is brilliant and full of great talent that make the characters come alive.BOTTOM LINE: Right now Dan Brown is rolling in it, but in a way I think he justifyingly earned it. The Da Vinci Code is a great, entertaining, and intelligent story, and now Ron Howard has translated it into film which has given us a great story to experience on the silver screen. Great acting and a very detailed story make The Da Vinci Code an entertaining ride all the way to the end. There are times where the editing makes it feel awkward and you can tell there were some problems translating the book to film, but it doesn't detract from the fact that this is a good film. It's not great, but it's not bad. I don't understand the mass hatred from all the film critics so far, I think the film has been attacked harshly for no reason other than it was hyped up to be so much more and didn't deliver on the rediculously high expectations.",4,"All Religous Talk Aside, Ron Howard Delivers An Entertaining Film Highlighted By Great Performances",1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,4431,"['MOVIE', 'One', 'most', 'anticipated', 'film', 'projects', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'finally', 'big', 'screen', 'flying', 'out', 'gate', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'had', 'huge', 'opening', 'weekend', 'earned', '77', 'million', 'also', 'made', 'film', 'history', 'having', 'largest', 'worldwide', 'gross', 'opening', 'weekend', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'Worldwide', 'film', 'grossed', 'massive', '224', 'million', 'budget', 'only', '125', 'million', 'only', '3', 'days', 'huge', 'so', 'apparently', 'negative', 'reviews', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'movie', 'goers', 'Why', 'did', 'film', 'get', 'trashed', 'way', 'did', 'absolutely', 'mind', 'Poseidon', 'better', 'reviews', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'film', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'constant', 'direction', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'off', 'track', 'found', 'completely', 'engrossed', 'plot', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'daunting', 'task', 'given', 'book', 'sold', '60', 'million', 'copies', 'huge', 'fanbase', 'awaiting', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'know', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'said', 'was', 'very', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'screenplay', 'was', 'focused', 'very', 'detailed', 'even', 'dialogue', 'did', 'make', 'film', 'slip', 'melodrama', 'few', 'places', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'necessarily', 'thrilling', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'always', 'held', 'attention', 'lot', 'people', 'complained', 'length', 'never', 'once', 'mind', 'when', 'was', 'seeing', 'did', 'think', 'started', 'drag', 'film', 'really', 'one', 'man', 'personal', 'journey', 'entire', 'ordeal', 'could', 'go', 'detail', 'religious', 'aspect', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'because', 'think', 'when', 'people', 'argue', 'religion', 'sides', 'argument', 'look', 'stupid', 'controversial', 'stuff', 'aside', 'well', 'made', 'very', 'detailed', 'film', 'great', 'complex', 'characters', 'lots', 'details', 'plot', 'lots', 'historical', 'references', 'When', 'get', 'down', 'basics', 'movie', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'hunt', 'holy', 'grail', 'found', 'be', 'great', 'entertaining', 'experience', 'were', 'few', 'editing', 'choices', 'was', 'not', 'fond', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'not', 'handled', 'well', 'Overall', 'was', 'great', 'hero', 'journey', 'full', 'circle', 'end', 'have', 'admit', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'incredibly', 'dull', 'were', ""n't"", 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'amazing', 'score', 'Even', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'favorite', 'composer', 'not', 'biased', 'statement', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'try', 'imagine', 'end', 'sequence', 'where', 'final', 'revelation', 'revealed', 'music', 'Lots', 'scenes', 'were', 'heavily', 'dependent', 'music', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'delivered', 'amazing', 'score', 'were', 'truly', 'breathtaking', 'cues', 'score', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'saved', 'music.ACTING', 'found', 'casting', 'film', 'be', 'perfect', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'opinion', 'intelligent', 'poise', 'brilliant', 'professor', 'would', 'have', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'just', 'tad', 'bit', 'times', 'then', 'again', 'one', 'could', 'blame', 'script', 'melodramatic', 'dialogue', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'brilliant', 'Sir', 'Leigh', 'times', 'steals', 'show', 'Other', 'supporting', 'work', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Bettany', 'was', 'terrific', 'Silas', 'albino', 'monk', 'really', 'made', 'dynamic', 'character', 'times', 'looked', 'exactly', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'just', 'observation', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'was', 'also', 'geat', 'detective', 'who', 'actually', 'played', 'role', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'based', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'admitted', 'wrote', 'Reno', 'character', 'mind', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'full', 'great', 'talent', 'make', 'characters', 'come', 'alive.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Right', 'now', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'rolling', 'way', 'think', 'justifyingly', 'earned', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'great', 'entertaining', 'intelligent', 'story', 'now', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'translated', 'film', 'given', 'great', 'story', 'experience', 'silver', 'screen', 'Great', 'acting', 'very', 'detailed', 'story', 'make', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'way', 'end', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'editing', 'feel', 'awkward', 'can', 'tell', 'were', 'problems', 'translating', 'book', 'film', ""n't"", 'detract', 'fact', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'mass', 'hatred', 'film', 'critics', 'so', 'far', 'think', 'film', 'been', 'attacked', 'harshly', 'reason', 'other', 'was', 'hyped', 'up', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'rediculously', 'high', 'expectations']",N/A

Loria,"[15, 23]","The Mona Lisa is one of the most famous and recognizable portraits ever painted, so it is appropriate that it is tied to one of the most recognizable pieces of fiction to come along in decades. The painting remains the subject of speculation; some believe Leonardo used himself as a model, others that the woman was a mistress of his patrons. The Da Vinci code creates much the same amount of speculation. Like viewing the enigmatic work by Leonardo in which the exchange between the viewer and the work itself is mesmerizing, engrossing, so it is with the Da Vinci Code. The blockbuster screen version of the historically successful-best-selling book about the frantic Euro-scavenger hunt to unlock a 2000-year-old secret. You must know the story by now it's been on the best-seller list longer than the last 2 Potter books. Okay, just incase...World-renowned Harvard symbologist Professor Robert Langdon (played by Tom Hanks) is called to a murder investigation, of which he becomes a suspect in, at the Louvre Museum. The museum curator has been murdered, turning his remains into a living symbol, well not living, turning his remains into a symbol that will lead Langdon and police cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) on the run and on a trail of clues and symbols leading to many secrets worked into the art of Leonardo Da Vinci, tied to a secret society dedicated to guarding the ancient secret. I know even if you haven't read it or seen.The Movie, like the book, has all the style and traditional suspense elements that make a movie of the genre work as an entertaining narrative, taking the viewer along with confidence that it is going one almost mainstream way (really? Secret societies & killer albino monks!!), then surprising you when it doesn't. It feels real familiar as a thriller then events twist and turn another way.The international cast is lead by 2-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks, who, with his stringy academic hair, embodies Dan Brown's protagonist for the film. Symbologist Robert Langdon is described early in the novel as being sort of a ""Harrison Ford in Harris tweed"" and Hanks is a solid choice (inspite of the fact that I would like to see Director Ron Howard draw from outside his personal actor's pool, casting an unknown is always a gamble). Langdon is the thinkin' man's hero, relentless in his quest to seek out the truth. Audrey Tautou , plays Sophie Neveu,  the strong partner with just as much personal as well as proffession at stake in solving the mystery. Also in Howard's ensemble cast is Sir Ian McKellen who delivers his typically brilliant portrayal as the enigmatic Sir Leigh Teabing. Paul Bettany, who appeared in Howard's Beautiful Mind, plays the bizarre monk Silas. Finally Jean Reno, plays French police captain Bezu Fach, a part written for Reno, literally, Dan Brown wrote the character with the French actor in mind!! Lastly but not least, Alfred ""throw me the idol"" Molina (Doc Oct in Spiderman 2) plays the Bishop Aringarosa with creepy distinction.Be warned the film stays fairly true to the novel and part of the fuss over it has been the premise that Da Vinci has left clues pointing to hidden ""history"" revealing Mary Magdalene as Jesus Christ's wife and that a daughter was born and concealed by the Church.See it, if for nothing other than to see the amazing BONDish locations, historical attractions and real (sometimes) works of art featured in the film. Location including: Paris' Musee du Louvre (the footage of the Louvre at night is beautiful), the Temple Church (of the Knights Templar), Westminster Abbey, Lincoln Cathedral (London) , Rosslyn Chapel (Scotland), Lincolnshire substituting for Castle Gandolfo, the Mediterranean island of Malta. Locations and art included give a much-needed authenticity that would have been lost on a backlot or soundstage shoot.Overall the film is definitely worth the price of admission but, be warned the film stays fairly true to the novel. Part of the fuss over CODE has been the premise that Da Vinci has left clues pointing to hidden ""history"" revealing Mary Magdalene as Jesus Christ's wife and that a daughter was born and concealed by the Church. This may anger Christians in general, Catholics in particular, especially those not willing to treat the film as fiction based on controversial theory. I for one am a Roman Catholic and find the material, of both the film and novel, fascinating and worth my time.Another warning due to the complicated exposition of the story the Da Vinci Code runs over 2 hours and many plot points necessary cause the film to drag at times. It has a Pg-13 rating for violence, some sexual content, brief drug references and disturbing images and themes.Lastly, I recommend that other Christians and Catholics (with serious inquires) take advantage of the excitement (good or bad) generated by this movie and use the opportunity it provides for church dialogue. Many churches have responded positively (and some negatively) by arming their congregations with their history and theology, along with strategies to spread their faith. That is what good books and movies should do: inspire people to think and ask interesting questions.",4,Faithful to the novel,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,5182,"['Mona', 'Lisa', 'one', 'most',

So I am writing this as my take on the movie.I felt it was excellent. The filming, special effects, acting and soundtrack all come together to present a superb mystery/though provoking movie.The premise of the film is simple. What if modern religion is/was a lie? What if Jesus WAS indeed a human? Would that not shake the very foundations that so many religions were forged upon? Indeed it would. Countless lives, battles, wars and crusades were carried out. More lives have been lost in the name of religion than for any other cause. Religions were the rock of governments for centuries even!If all of that came into question, it stands to follow that everything would then be questioned. Hence the premise for this film.In order to preserve societies and the world, as well as people's beliefs and lives even, a secret society was formed. To protect the world from the truth. So, if you can bring it into your mind that what we know today as religious history is a lie you can understand how unearthing the truth would shatter lives everywhere.The further mystery is... what exactly is the truth? And what do we do with it when we find it?All in all I would say that would be a most devastating blow to mankind. The way this movie plays it all out, with twists and turns, is done to perfection. It's part cat-and-mouse, part treasure hunt, part murder mystery and a big part of moral and ethical questioning.If you like a really good mystery that provokes much deeper and broader thinking, you will definitely like this movie. Nothing comes close in this realm. And, if you did like this movie you should read 'Another Roadside Attraction' and/or 'Skinny Legs and All', both by Tom Robbins.",5,"Excellent, thought-provoking film.",1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,1762,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'however', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'am', 'writing', 'take', 'movie.I', 'felt', 'was', 'excellent', 'filming', 'special', 'effects', 'acting', 'soundtrack', 'come', 'together', 'present', 'superb', 'provoking', 'movie.The', 'premise', 'film', 'simple', 'What', 'modern', 'religion', 'lie', 'What', 'Jesus', 'WAS', 'indeed', 'human', 'Would', 'not', 'shake', 'very', 'foundations', 'so', 'many', 'religions', 'were', 'forged', 'Indeed', 'would', 'Countless', 'battles', 'wars', 'crusades', 'were', 'carried', 'out', 'More', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'name', 'religion', 'other', 'cause', 'Religions', 'were', 'rock', 'governments', 'centuries', 'even', 'came', 'question', 'follow', 'everything', 'would', 'then', 'be', 'questioned', 'Hence', 'premise', 'film.In', 'order', 'preserve', 'societies', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'beliefs', 'lives', 'even', 'secret', 'society', 'was', 'formed', 'protect', 'world', 'truth', 'So', 'can', 'bring', 'mind', 'what', 'know', 'today', 'religious', 'history', 'lie', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'unearthing', 'truth', 'would', 'shatter', 'lives', 'everywhere.The', 'further', 'mystery', 'what', 'exactly', 'truth', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'when', 'find', 'would', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'devastating', 'blow', 'mankind', 'way', 'movie', 'out', 'twists', 'turns', 'done', 'perfection', 'part', 'cat-and-mouse', 'part', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'part', 'murder', 'mystery', 'big', 'part', 'moral', 'ethical', 'questioning.If', 'really', 'good', 'mystery', 'much', 'deeper', 'broader', 'thinking', 'will', 'definitely', 'movie', 'Nothing', 'close', 'realm', 'did', 'like', 'movie', 'should', 'read', ""'Another"", 'Roadside', 'Attraction', 'and/or', 'Legs', 'All', 'Tom', 'Robbins']",N/A

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 3]","When I read Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code,"" I thought to myself that this would be excellent on the big screen.  All of the religious issues aside (I'm Catholic and not convinced by this work of FICTION!), ""Code"" read like a big action/mystery yarn with a non-stop chase sequence.  Unfortunately, Ron Howard's handling of the book on the big screen isn't what I'd hoped for.  The story seems to get lost in the ""whodunit?"" aspect and leaves most viewers (like my wife) completely lost until the end of the film.  Also, the characters aren't developed well enough to have any attachment to them.  In the book, Silas comes across as one of the most pitiful creatures on the planet.  Manipulated by those who use his convictions against him, Silas is one of the most saddening characters I've ever run into.  On the big screen, he's portrayed as nothing but a religious zealot until the bloody end.  Tom Hanks, Jean Reno, and Alfred Molina all play their respective characters well, but I can find no attachment to them.  Audrey Tautou is, in my opinion, very unlikeable as Sophie.  The biggest shocker to me was Ian McKellen's total misplay of Teabing.  In the book, Teabing was drawn out as the jolly scoundrel who got away with any and everything because he's British.  In this movie, McKellen plays down the character and even though he still has that British charm about him, he's not as interesting as I'd hoped he be.In short, read the book, kiddoes.  It's much better than this film.  As far as the DVD goes, it's packed with the typical ""pat on the back"" documenaries.  The digital transfer is nice, and I have no complaints about the audio.  I just feel that the film is nowhere near as good as it could have been.Don't let the religious twists and historical inaccuracies discourage you, this is a very good story, but it's so much better on the page than it is on the screen.",3,Opie Drops The Ball,1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,1885,"['When', 'read', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'thought', 'myself', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'big', 'screen', 'religious', 'issues', ""'m"", 'Catholic', 'not', 'convinced', 'work', 'FICTION', 'Code', 'read', 'big', 'action/mystery', 'yarn', 'non-stop', 'chase', 'sequence', 'Unfortunately', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'handling', 'book', 'big', 'screen', ""n't"", 'what', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'story', 'get', 'lost', 'whodunit', 'aspect', 'most', 'viewers', 'wife', 'completely', 'lost', 'end', 'film', 'Also', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'developed', 'well', 'enough', 'have', 'attachment', 'book', 'Silas', 'one', 'most', 'pitiful', 'creatures', 'planet', 'Manipulated', 'who', 'use', 'convictions', 'Silas', 'one', 'most', 'saddening', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'run', 'big', 'screen', 'portrayed', 'nothing', 'religious', 'zealot', 'bloody', 'end', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'play', 'respective', 'characters', 'well', 'can', 'find', 'attachment', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'opinion', 'very', 'unlikeable', 'Sophie', 'biggest', 'shocker', 'was', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'total', 'misplay', 'Teabing', 'book', 'Teabing', 'was', 'drawn', 'out', 'jolly', 'scoundrel', 'who', 'got', 'away', 'everything', 'British', 'movie', 'McKellen', 'down', 'character', 'even', 'still', 'British', 'charm', 'not', 'as', 'interesting', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'be.In', 'short', 'read', 'book', 'kiddoes', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'As', 'far', 'DVD', 'packed', 'typical', 'pat', 'back', 'documenaries', 'digital', 'transfer', 'nice', 'have', 'complaints', 'audio', 'just', 'feel', 'film', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'religious', 'twists', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'discourage', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'page', 'screen']",N/A

On one hand, all the way until the very end, it was just another action/mystery fictional movie with an anti-Catholic Church bias.

639846,A3P9BQU9W0IRXW,B00005JOC9,Kit Disney Ballantyne,"[6, 8]","Spoiler Alert : This review tells a little of the plot. If you don't want to know what happens in the first reel, read something else.I've been hearing for years about this awful book and the movie they were going to make of it. I heard how it would ruin the faith of millions. I heard from TV and radio preachers how dangerous it was. It could bring about the end of Christianity! So, of course, I had to read the book. And, because the book was so good, I wanted to see the movie.Dan Brown was quite skillful at spinning his story. He used real locations of historical religious interest and then added little hints in them that were from his own imagination. Hwe created believable characters for people to care about. He did it so well, that people believed he was telling the truth. The film was shot at many of those actual loations, which is what adds such depth and realism. It's easy to get caught up in the emotion of discovering the next clue without getting arrested, shot at or killed. It is very much like an interactive video game, but cheaper.Now the thing everyone was spazzing out about was the idea that Jesus Christ was married to Mary Magdaline and had a daughter with her. This began a whole series of events to ensure the continuannce of the Holy bloodline and groups willing to kill in order to keep the secret. So, like in National Treasure, a HUGE conspiracy exists down through the ages. Well, okay, I like a good conspiracy film.It should be pointed out that in the book the whole topic of Jesus being married only took up a couple of pages - in a book with hundreds of pages, labled as FICTION. In the movie it gets slightly more time, but not much. The book and movie are effective because they are written and staged so well. I  watched it with people who came to believe that Jesus was indeed married, and had living descendants and that people were killing to cover it up. So, the story telling is THAT effective, just like it should be in any compelling fiction.Let's remember this : it IS fiction. The book is fiction and the movie is based on that fiction. So there's no need to get up in arms about it. Let's not push the panic button just yet.Despite the fact that this is supposed to be the greatest secret of all time that people were willing to kill and die for it, Leonardo DaVinci seemed to encode clues about it in his writings, paintings and diagrams. This is exactly like National Treasures. The clues are there for the public to find, which makes one wonder why secret-keepers would leave so much evidence behind to expose the secret. Of course if they didn't, we wouldn't have such films.Ron Howard does a superb job directing this film. This is precisely why it is so good. I was not overjoyed with Tom Hank's acting job. It wasn't terrible, but I wasn't convinced he was experiencing the things in the script, nor having the emotions one would in those situations. It was flat. He was probably tired from all the travelling and sick from all the exotic foods on location. He showed up on the set but didn't do much. It cost the film at least one of the stars in this review.This film opens with a bloody murder. It then finds a conspirator under every bush, willing to kill to keep the secret. It takes you into dark corners to encounter evil people, along with well-meaning fanatics willing to do anything to protect the FAITH. In my opinion, it didn't have any positive portrayal of any Bible-believing Christian. But then again, Hollywood is rarely good to Christians.Now I AM a solid Bible-believer. I say that so that no one thinks I like this film because I hate God or anything like that. Maybe it's the rebel in me, or the inner guy that does not want to be told what to watch and not watch, but I see almost EVERY film the Christian preachers warn me against. ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" for instance, is one of the best films ever made. Like ""The Da Vinci Code,"" it is well written FICTION.Let's not get ourselves into a holier-than-thou uproar about a novel being made into a film. For one thing, more people see films when they hear they should stay away. I never would have heard of it had not the preachers screamed against it. I have my own mind.I know the plot of The DaVinci Code is fiction. I know Jesus did not have a child. I also know that Jesus was not on the cross fantasizing about what His life would have been like had He chosen not to die for our sins. Yet, in each case, I found something to like in loving, fictional accounts that that a few pokes at our sacred cows. Hey, I even saw ""Dogma."" Does that make me a bad person?Back on this DaVinci Code thingy. It was enjoyable, and since purchasing it, I have seen it a few times and found something new in each viewing. Dan Brown spun a Christian icon, the Holy Grail and wrote a book that became an enjoyable movie. If the acting was better and if it included any ethical Christians, I would have given it more stars.So, watch it or don't watch it. Rent it or don't. Buy it or don't. There is no need to picket the video stores that sell it or boycott anyone. Chill out. Peace my brothers and sisters. Get it out of your head that this simple movie is some sort of evil plot against Christianity, God, the Holy Bible and Jesus Christ. Lighten up. Enjoy it or ignore it.If this film is a threat to your faith, then your faith is weak indeed. Perhaps you could practice faith in your own life rather than condemning people that write harmless fiction and talented people who make such books into movies.Holy relics are not needed in true faith, and actually draw people away by getting them into exhalting man-made things. Read my book on Idoltry if it ever comes out. If people weren't thinking of a Holy Grail and trying to find it, believing it is magic or holy because Christ touched it, or that it would prove Bible to be true, these conpiracies would not exist. It is our failure to worship God and Him alone that takes us down these strange paths of spiritual detours, looking for objects to place on our altars. Or, perhaps the object of faith is a human being. Some people lived fairly faithful lives, but after their death the admiration for them grew into something more. Some so-called Christians try to contact the dead or even pray to them. If your Holy Grail is a human or a relic; toss it out. The true threat to Christian faith is the Christian who does not follow the Bible.Now that this review has become a sermon, they probably won't post it on the website, in which case all this writing was a supreme waste of time. But The DaVinci Code was interesting and the debates and books about it were a nice little diversion for a season.I liked the film or I wouldn't have purchased it. I don't seek to own DVDs I don't like. So, the fact that I bought speaks more than this whole long,lousy review.Peace",3,"Lighten Up, It's Fiction",1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,6851,"['Spoiler', 'Alert', 'review', 'little', 'plot', 'do',

639857,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JOC9,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 9]","When I saw the movie version of ""The Da Vinci Code"" what I remembered about the books where the basics: who is the villain, what is the Holy Grail, and where the body is buried. I recognized all of the puzzles that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) has to solve, although I did not really remember the solutions, so I was in the fortuitous position of not really recalling what was about to happen next. Consequently, I was just able to go along with the movie and enjoy how the cinematic adaptation of Dan Brown's novel played out. However, I realize that this is a point of equilibrium that will not apply to most reviewers, because on the one hand there will be those who have not read the novel who might have trouble keeping up with all the pieces, while on the other there will be devotes of the book who will be anguished by everything left out or changed in the transformation from novel to film.At the Musee de Louvre in Paris, Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle) is shot by a a mysterious figure in a monk's habit named Silas (Paul Bettany). Before he dies Sauniere leaves a series of clues, which point to Langdon, a Harvard professor whose forte is religious symbols. Captain Fache (Jean Reno) of the Paris police is convinced Langdon is the murderer, but Langdon is helped to escape by Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), the granddaugther of the murdered man, who believes Langdon can decipher the clues. Langdon needs the help of Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen), an expert on the legends of the Holy Grail, to understand what is really at stake. Meanwhile, both Fache and Silas are chasing after Langdon and Sophie, spurred on by the machinations of Bishop Arigarosa (Alfred Molina).I cannot speak for those who have not read the book, But I certainly do not think that director Ron Howard has made a thriller simply because the story revolves around thinking and talking more than anything else, so I would qualify it as more of a mystery than anything else. Certainly it does not have the frenetic energy of the modern thriller movie, where the camera never stands still because you might actually see what is happening on screen. Akiva Goldsman's screenplay focuses on Robert Langdon as a problem solver and leaves the heavy exposition to the Leigh Teabing character. Langdon is more of a skeptic in this version, which allows him to be more reasonable than the true believers.  Actually, what might be the most fascinating part of the movie is when we first meet Langdon and he is lecturing on symbols and using visual aids to show that symbols are meant to be interpreted (which I take to be the caveat they provided instead of the disclaimer in the opening credits many insisted upon).Langdon makes a key distinction at one point when he tells Sophie that the complicated situation in which they find themselves involves people who believe that all of these stories about Mary Magdalene et. al is true. The distinction is important because ultimately ""The Da Vinci Code"" does not have to convince us that any of this is true, but rather than there are people who believe it and that those beliefs help to solve the various clues. The book's puzzles are greatly reduced in the movie, while the significance of the story of Mary Magdalene grows in relationship.

639858,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005JOC9,Lee Armstrong,"[1, 3]","""The DaVinci Code"" was only recently purchased by me.  I've read the book & seen the theatrical release.  Hanz Zimmer's score was nominated for a Golden Globe award.  Ron Howard won his Best Director Oscar for ""A Beautiful Mind"" in 2001.  I thought he did an excellent job of keeping the pacing moving and the unexpected plot turns popping up with regularity.  I greatly appreciated the look of the film and the stunning locations.The most amazing performance in the film for me is Paul Bettany as Silas.  The intensity and level of commitment he brings to the role is breathtaking.  As the cold-blooded killer who breaks the ten commandments as a service to God and flagellates himself as punishment, Bettany takes the performance over the top.Audrey Tautou charmed me inAmeliefor which she received a Best Actress nomination from the French Academy of Cinema in 2001.  She demonstrates range from that film to this by playing Sophie Neveu with a tightly controlled performance.Tom Hanks won back-to-back Oscars in 1993 & 1994 for ""Philadelphia"" & ""Forrest Gump"" and was nominated for ""Saving Private Ryan"" in 1998 and for ""Cast Away"" in 2000.  As Robert Langdon, he gives a thoughtful performance, playing a character who is cerebral.  Howard gives him quite a bit of screen time as we watch him think.  It's interesting, but short of gripping.Ian McKellan was twice Oscar-nominated for Best Actor for ""Gods & Monsters"" in 1998 and in the supporting role in ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" in 2001.  As Sir Leigh Teabring, he almost makes me forget X-men with a strong performance as the wealthy man who enjoys pulling the strings.Other performances are also of note.  Alfred Molina from ""Chocolat"" in 2000 andLutherin 2003 plays Bishop Aringarosa who comes across as a heavy (pun intended) fanatic who is willing to break commandments for religious political expediency.  Jurgen Prochnow from ""Das Boot"" (1981), ""The English Patient"" (1996), & ""Air Force One"" (1997) performs well as the bank manager Vernet who also wants to own the secrets in Neveu's account.  Jean Reno who I loved in the 1994 filmThe Professionaland enjoyed in ""The Pink Panther (2006) plays Captain Bezu Fache, the police chief who works to solve the crime.  Jean-Yves Borteloot plays Teabring's chauffeur Remy Jean and is given a free reign by Ron Howard to excellent result.  Marie-Francoise Audollent does a nice cameo as Sister Sandrine who runs into Brother Silas.Dan Brown's book has of course created controversy, particularly from those unable to distinguish fiction from real life or those whose weak faith results in defensiveness about their religion.  The magnificent teachings and life of Jesus of Nazareth cannot be threatened by this fictional film anymore than the Taj Mahal could be threatened by a fly.  As a film, this works well, entertaining with repeated viewings.

Every page presented a new puzzle and, as a reader, I was able to make some educated guesses as well as stop and read a passage over again to make sure I understood.  I gave the book my highest rating and recommended it to all.  That's why I was anxious to see the movie.  I even bought tickets in advance for opening night.Fifteen minutes into the film I fell asleep.  I guess that says something.  But I did wake up and try to enjoy this flick.  I couldn't.  Actually I'm embarrassed for Ron Howard who I know to be a fine director.  And the stars, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou, have also done better work in the past.The screenwriter tried to present all the puzzles that were in the book.  That was an absolutely impossible task.  On the big screen it comes out as one big jumble.  There are secret societies, a coded bank vault, a couple of different religious cults, and a question about whether Jesus and Mary Magdalene were every married and had a child. There are puzzles and puzzles and more puzzles to solve.  It's hard to tell who the good guys are.  But the main characters are some kind of geniuses because they constantly have brilliant thoughts;  and  then - poof - the latest puzzle is solved, only to be replaced by an even bigger puzzle.  There is no time to absorb all the details. The storyline is lost because of all the confusion.  Also, some of the film is in French and the titles are so big and so spread across the big screen that the concentration it takes to read them made it even harder to follow this convoluted story.  It was hard to stay awake.  I tried though.  I really wanted to like this film.  Instead I hated it.There have been a lot of protests by religious groups about this film.  Supposedly, it questions the very foundations of Christianity.  I don't think the Church has to worry though.  The story is so complicated that it is impossible to follow.  And besides, nobody ever said that this wasn't FICTION.I'm glad I saw the film.  I wanted to see for myself what all the hype is about.  I also think personal taste is developed by experimenting with a wide variety of different kinds of things.  So see it if you must.

639873,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B00005JOC9,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[4, 9]","I liked the ""DaVinci Code"", and considered its premise intriguing.  I didn't rush out and debate it at the water cooler, didn't consult my priest, didn't go crazy and buy everything Dan Brown had written (most of it workmanlike, but not noteworthy!).  I reread it a couple of weeks ago to refamiliarize myself for the movie, and liked it a little better.  I think Dan Brown wrote it with the screen in mind.The controversy around the world based on first the book and then the movie amuses me.  Brown raises some age-old religious fables which have an element of believable truth in them.  If you are a Christian, and especially if you are Catholic, you should be more concerned about the political machinations for hundreds of years of a faith trying to cover up its less than savory origins, and not so much about all the details of how Jesus lived.  And no matter who you are, please keep in mind, THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.So I decided to put to the side all the controversy over the film in the review and simply focus on the film itself.  I would have liked the film's director to do that as well, and to make the film as art, without regard to worldwide events.  But,as usual, Ron Howard avoided controversy.  Like in the film, ""A Beautiful Mind"" where he avoided the homosexuality and abusiveness of his main character, and in ""Cinderella Man"" where he avoided the corruption in the fight industry, Howard plays to the mainstream.The DaVinci Code deserved another director.  For one thing, without Howard, there would probably have been no Tom Hanks.  Hanks can be an actor without peer (Philadelphia), but the hero of this book had to be passionate about his belief in the finding of the Holy Grail, and torn in his decision on whether to reveal it.  Hanks is of an age and of a look where he needs to step up to the roles of older men.Writer Akiva Goldman chose in the script to write Langdon as a skeptic, and Hanks conveyed it, without managing to generate any heat for Sophie's (Audrey Tautou) character.  Who better - Hugh Jackman?  Sean Penn?  Adrien Brody?  Nicholas Cage?  Certainly I would have rather seen Langdon played with the quirky characteristics that a ""symbologist"" must have, given their careers.I felt the rest of the cast played true, especially Ian McKellan as Sir Leigh Teague.  McKellan sparkled, and the film came alive for awhile when he first came on the screen.  The problem is the blending of the cast, eliciting both individually great performances and ensemble mentality; Howard failed here, and the results make the audience restless.  He has done this fine blending once or twice in the past, but he is usually more concerned about the visual quality of the film (DaVinci was stunning) and the concepts...whether to use flashback and CSI (both are quietly stunning in this film) and steering clear of controversy. It's a shame, when he always manages to put a cast of fine actors together.My main complaint is that DaVinci should have been a thriller.  Maybe it is difficult to brink an important contemporary novel to the screen and elicit the pace and the emotion that makes a good thriller.  Somebody better tell Clint Eastwood that...his ""Mystic River"" was far superior to Howard's effort here, and he would have been a better choice to direct.The film was visually stunning and the content adequate.

There is no truth in the fiction that was written and filmed here.  Shame on all you people who have wasted the good Lords money on this twisted, vile product of camel puke and blasphemy.  This movie, like that wretched book by Dan Brown, is only based on assumed facts and details.  People passed on these lies for years and years until some Satan-lover finally wrote them down in a book form.  Fortunately this is nothing compare the almighty Holy Bible which was passed down for years and years until somebody finally wrote it down in a book form, hmm where did I hear that before ... anyway Jesus hates this movie and so should you!Just look at the cast and crew,  Ron Howard...he has 2 first names, the first sign of the devil .. you don't see Lucifer having a last name.. no he is known by many names but they are always first name names and Mr. Howard has 2 of them.  Tom Hanks, he's already played a gay in the movie ""Philadelphia"" and let me tell you something from Leviticus, Chapter 20: ""And if a man lies down with another man, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death.""  Oh yeah Mr. Tom Hanks , heed God's Warning, even if you were only pretending or what you call ""acting"" , because Jesus thinks that acting is lying, and in fact you are lying to God when you act ... Liar!!!Shall I go on or do you get the point?  I would suggest you to go see the ""Passion of the Christ"" .. take the kids and see Jesus get the BeJesus kicked out of him,  they might puke and scream but they'll thank you for it later when they are mindless obedient servants of the Lord.  Or rent the ""Left Behind"" series as God takes the righteous and leaves behind the rest so that when Jesus returns he can destroy them all with his balls of fire and watch them burn and twist in eternal pain and laugh at their endless suffering...HA!  it's a hoot, the kids with love it.To recap...this fictional Hollywood movie is fiction in the most absolute ""untrue"", ""do not  believe your mortal eyes"" sort of way.  Why?  Because Jesus says so !and also Tom Hank's is going to straight to Hell.So all you Christians out there remember that maybe it's time to stop not doing what you pretended you can do and can't, and start doing the thing that you can't do, but can no longer pretend that you can and choose not to watch this film even when you can because you can't and you won't  and  remember Jesus that loves you unless you don't love him, then he'll make you BURN for eternity.",4,Jesus has been ANGERED!,1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,2570,"[""'m"", 'hear', 'tell', 'fictional', 'movie', 'completely', 'fictional', 'truth', 'fiction', 'was', 'written', 'filmed', 'here', 'Shame', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'wasted', 'good', 'Lords', 'money', 'twisted', 'vile', 'product', 'camel', 'puke', 'blasphemy', 'movie', 'wretched', 'book', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'only', 'based', 'assumed', 'facts', 'details', 'People', 'passed', 'lies', 'years', 'years', 'Satan-lover', 'finally', 'wrote', 'down', 'book', 'form', 'Fortunately', 'nothing', 'compare', 'almighty', 'Holy', 'Bible', 'was', 'passed', 'down', 'years', 'years', 'somebody', 'finally', 'wrote', 'down', 'book', 'form', 'hmm', 'where', 'did', 'hear', 'anyway', 'Jesus', 'movie', 'so', 'should', 'Just', 'look', 'cast', 'crew', 'Ron', 'Howard', '2', 'first', 'names', 'first', 'sign', 'devil', '..', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Lucifer', 'having', 'last', 'name..', 'known', 'many', 'names', 'are', 'always', 'first', 'name', 'names', 'Mr.', 'Howard', '2', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'already', 'played', 'gay', 'movie', 'Philadelphia', 'let', 'tell', 'something', 'Leviticus', 'Chapter', '20', 'man', 'down', 'man', 'have', 'committed', 'abomination', 'shall', 'surely', 'be', 'put', 'death', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Mr.', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'heed', 'God', 'Warning', 'even', 'were', 'only', 'pretending', 'what', 'call', 'acting', 'Jesus', 'acting', 'lying', 'fact', 'are', 'lying', 'God', 'when', 'act', 'Liar', 'Shall', 'go', 'do', 'get', 'point', 'would', 'suggest', 'go', 'see', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'take', 'kids', 'see', 'Jesus', 'get', 'BeJesus', 'kicked', 'might', 'puke', 'scream', ""'ll"", 'thank', 'later', 'when', 'are', 'mindless', 'obedient', 'servants', 'Lord', 'rent', 'Left', 'Behind', 'series', 'God', 'righteous', 'rest', 'so', 'when', 'Jesus', 'can', 'destroy', 'balls', 'fire', 'watch', 'burn', 'twist', 'eternal', 'pain', 'laugh', 'endless', 'suffering', 'HA', 'hoot', 'kids', 'love', 'it.To', 'recap', 'fictional', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'fiction', 'most', 'absolute', 'untrue', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'mortal', 'eyes', 'sort', 'way', 'Why', 'Jesus', 'so', 'also', 'Tom', 'Hank', 'going', 'straight', 'Hell.So', 'Christians', 'there', 'remember', 'maybe', 'time', 'stop', 'not', 'doing', 'what', 'pretended', 'can', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'start', 'doing', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'pretend', 'can', 'choose', 'not', 'watch', 'film', 'even', 'when', 'can', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Jesus', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'then', ""'ll"", 'make', 'BURN', 'eternity']",N/A
639887,A2LIZU9811OW3N,B00005JOC9,"MaZ Modestou ""MJM""","[4, 7]","Ok let me start by saying that the 4 star rating is for the movie and the movie alone, this does not reflect my belief in the validity of any of these events.THE MOVIE: As a mystery-thriller the movie is an interesting watch. There are indeed errors regarding factual events and many things that don't add up, but if you are just going to watch an interesting mystery then it is worth the watch. If you're going to focus too much on fact then you will find yourself mumbling ""that's not how that happened"", ""that can't possibly be true"" and such throughout most of the movie.Take this movie for what it is: A fictional ""what if"" movie plot based on some fact but mostly fiction and theory.I myself enjoyed the movie; I found it interesting as I am big fan of conspiracy, good performances were given by the actors, Tom Hanks did well considering this is not his usual type of role. Though I did figure out most of the twists long before they occurred and I did find the ending somewhat lacking, but overall I was intrigued and would recommend this movie.THE THEORY: Too much does not add for this theory to stand. It's an interesting idea (which could very well be true) but you must understand that currently there is no hard proof to substantiate this theory. As I said above, there are many errors regarding factual events which reflect the author's negligence and lack of thorough research. If he cannot even get the factual events right, then what hope does he have of substantiating this rumor/theory?In the movie they show us Leonardo Da Vinci's painting of ""The Last Supper"" and point out that there is a woman next to Jesus (who is claimed to be Mary Magdalene). First of all there is no hard evidence to prove that this is Mary Magdalene. Second of all, assuming that this is true, then what happened to the 12th Apostle? You will notice there are 13 people in the painting, Jesus in the middle and 6 on either side. Throughout history and in the bible we are told of 12 Apostles, and they are depicted as 12 males. So my question is, if that is indeed meant to be a woman, then what happened to the 12th Apostle? .... And what's even stranger is the fact that this is not addressed at all in the movie. You would think that this would be one of the first questions someone would ask, but no, no explanation of any kind was given. And I know many people out there who take the book and movie as fact will come up with many scenarios to explain this, but that does not change the fact that it is still just hear-say.I am neither supporting nor disputing this theory, but either way we know that Jesus did exist, whether human or divine, he did good things, and most of the teachings tell us to be good people, do good things, and live an honorable life. I do not need a God to tell me this; I do not need Jesus to be divine or ""The Son of God"" to know that his intents were good. So those of faith do not let this rumor/theory shake your faith, instead let it become stronger. For if he was but a mere human... then perhaps he is even more divine than we thought.",4,Where's the 12th Apostle??,1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,3072,"['Ok', 'let', 'start', 'saying', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'movie', 'movie', 'alone', 'not', 'reflect', 'belief', 'validity', 'events.THE', 'MOVIE', 'mystery-thriller', 'movie', 'interesting', 'watch', 'are', 'indeed', 'errors', 'regarding', 'factual', 'events', 'many', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'watch', 'interesting', 'mystery', 'then', 'watch', ""'re"", 'going', 'focus', 'too', 'much', 'fact', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'mumbling', 'not', 'how', 'happened', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'true', 'such', 'most', 'movie.Take', 'movie', 'what', 'fictional', 'what', 'movie', 'plot', 'based', 'fact', 'mostly', 'fiction', 'theory.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'found', 'interesting', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'conspiracy', 'good', 'performances', 'were', 'given', 'actors', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'did', 'well', 'considering', 'not', 'usual', 'type', 'role', 'did', 'figure', 'out', 'most', 'twists', 'long', 'occurred', 'did', 'find', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'overall', 'was', 'intrigued', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie.THE', 'THEORY', 'Too', 'much', 'not', 'add', 'theory', 'stand', 'interesting', 'idea', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'true', 'must', 'understand', 'currently', 'hard', 'proof', 'substantiate', 'theory', 'said', 'above', 'are', 'many', 'errors', 'regarding', 'factual', 'events', 'reflect', 'author', 'negligence', 'lack', 'thorough', 'research', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'factual', 'events', 'right', 'then', 'what', 'hope', 'have', 'substantiating', 'rumor/theory', 'movie', 'show', 'Leonardo', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'painting', 'Last', 'Supper', 'point', 'out', 'woman', 'Jesus', 'who', 'claimed', 'be', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'First', 'hard', 'evidence', 'prove', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'Second', 'assuming', 'true', 'then', 'what', 'happened', '12th', 'Apostle', 'will', 'notice', 'are', '13', 'people', 'painting', 'Jesus', 'middle', '6', 'side', 'history', 'bible', 'are', 'told', '12', 'Apostles', 'are', 'depicted', '12', 'males', 'question', 'indeed', 'meant', 'be', 'woman', 'then', 'what', 'happened', '12th', 'Apostle', 'what', 'even', 'stranger', 'fact', 'not', 'addressed', 'movie', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'first', 'questions', 'someone', 'would', 'ask', 'explanation', 'kind', 'was', 'given', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'take', 'book', 'movie', 'fact', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'many', 'scenarios', 'explain', 'not', 'change', 'fact', 'still', 'just', 'hear-say.I', 'am', 'supporting', 'disputing', 'theory', 'way', 'know', 'Jesus', 'did', 'exist', 'human', 'divine', 'did', 'good', 'things', 'most', 'teachings', 'tell', 'be', 'good', 'people', 'do', 'good', 'things', 'live', 'honorable', 'life', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'God', 'tell', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'Jesus', 'be', 'divine', 'Son', 'God', 'know', 'intents', 'were', 'good', 'faith', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'rumor/theory', 'shake', 'faith', 'instead', 'let', 'become', 'stronger', 'was', 'mere', 'human', 'then', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'divine', 'thought']",N/A

(But if Nicole Richie has it, then damn, so can I!) But I am interested in the whole idea of the ""Son Of God"" having a child. I went to the cinema to see Passion Of The Christ, and own it on DVD, and I'll probably buy this on DVD too.I have bought the book (for dead cheap), but am saving it for my holidays, for something to do while I'm lying in the sunshine. For those reviewers who say you'll not be able to follow the film if you haven't read the book - rubbish. I went with someone who hasn't read the book also, and we managed to follow it all right I guess. But at 149 minutes long, you don't wanna be drinking during this.I was quite interested in all the little puzzles in this, and how everything was eventually pieced together. It did get my curiosity going, although I did find it slightly predictable, when they mentioned Jesus had a child, but I'm gonna keep it zipped it here.Everyone who has read the book, or seen the film, will know the storyline already, but basically some guy dies, but before he does, he leaves a bunch of clues for the granddaughter he hasn't seen in years (Audrey Tatou), and some Professor, who claims not to know him that well (Tom Hanks.) There's an albino monk, who just appears for no reason, and keeps self flagellating - not a pretty sight, and will take you straight back to viewing Passion Of The Christ. And there are a few others, some ambiguous characters, who help the film stretch out to 149 minutes.In my opinion, you're gonna believe what you wanna believe, but all the hoo-ha about this film, and protestors & such, is just too over the top. But also to me, this film felt like one big lecture about Christianity, and everything linked in to it. Some of the dialogue was so monotone, and very boring, I actually switched off during some of it. (And still managed to follow the film.) Could they not have made it seem a bit more lifelike, it sounded sometimes like the characters were reading straight from the script! C'mon guys, jazz it up a bit, start rapping or something! Now that would be a sight.In my personal opinion, I quite believe the whole Mary Magdalene having Jesus' child, and him having descendants. He was a young guy, do we really wanna believe he died without experiencing stuff like this? Nah. To me, it's all true, but people will believe what they want, but just shove it down our throats alright?This film is going to be one of the biggest films of the year, simply because there is so much hype surrounding it.

One night he is mysteriously summoned to the Louvre by an inspector (Jean Reno) who is investigating the murder of the elderly curator, which has taken place inside the museum. The murder victim left a series of symbolic codes at the crime scene before his death, and at first Robert believes that the police have asked for his help because of his work as a symbologist. However, French cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) arrives on the scene and manages to inform Robert that he is actually a suspect in the case and is in grave danger. Robert and Sophie manage to escape and work together to decipher the mysterious codes that the curator left specifically for them to find. Soon they find themselves in the middle of a mystery that dates back thousands of years and revolves around a secret society known as the Priory of Sion. As they race around Paris and London and enlist in the help of Robert's eccentric former colleague (Ian McKellen), they find themselves targets of Opus Dei, an organization sanctioned by the Vatican that is intent on preserving the biggest secret of the Catholic church, which if revealed has the potential to forever alter Christianity and much of history in general.I was extremely impressed with the way director Ron Howard brought Brown's novel to life. The use of flashback sequences and three-dimensional graphics to help the audience decipher the code along with Robert and Sophie was an excellent choice. The film was exciting and suspenseful from beginning to end, just like the book. The actors were perfectly cast in their roles. Hanks, Tautou, Reno, and McKellen all had great chemistry together and stayed very true to Brown's characters. Everything in the movie looked exactly the way I pictured it when I was reading the book. It was great to see so many famous European buildings and landmarks on the screen. I also thought that the film's score was wonderful and really enhanced the suspenseful moments of the movie.Any film that is adapted from a book is bound to omit some details and there were a few tiny things missing from the movie, but overall I think almost everything (and certainly everything important) was left intact. Howard chose to tone down a few things that he felt might offend the religious community the most. For example, I think the Bishop's role in the movie was limited slightly in the film compared to the book, and the religious officials didn't seem quite as evil onscreen as they do in print. Sophie's flashback of the ""ritual"" she witnessed at her grandfather's home as a child was also toned down a lot. I also noticed a few details from the film that seemed to be changed for no reason at all...in Brown's novel, Jacques Sauniere really IS Sophie's biological grandfather, but the movie explains things a bit differently. Also, why did the filmmakers choose to omit the appearance of Sophie's brother at the end of the movie? I guess it didn't really take away from the film as a whole, but the guy who is supposed to be Sophie's brother in the book was actually IN the movie...they just never mentioned the fact that he was her brother! That struck me as being kind of pointless and odd. Finally, Robert and Sophie didn't share a kiss at the end of the movie. Brown always led his readers to believe that those two characters hook up in the end...a kiss on the forehead just doesn't cut it!Brown's novel, while incredibly entertaining, is very poorly written in places and also lacks cohesiveness throughout. In a lot of ways, I think Howard's movie is better organized than the book...the transitions are a lot smoother and the story isn't as ""all over the place"" as the novel sometimes is. I still think the book is great and I encourage people to read it before heading to the theatre to see the film. There is a lot more detail in the book that couldn't possibly be included in the movie, and since there is so much going on in the film, the story might be easier for people to follow if they've read the book.A lot of controversy has surrounded the book ""The Da Vinci Code"" and now surrounds the film. I really don't see what all the fuss is about. This is just a story...fiction. There are so many theories about Jesus and Mary Magdalene and Christianity in general. Just because a person chooses to read ""The Da Vinci Code"" or see the movie doesn't mean they are in any way forsaking the church. It's entertainment! I think the church and its leaders just make things worse for themselves when they throw fits about things like this.Overall, I loved ""The Da Vinci Code!"" This movie couldn't really have been any better. Everyone should go see it in the theatre...it's fun, exciting, suspenseful, and it will give you a lot to think about!",5,Fascinating and fun,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,5194,"['Why', 'are', 'so',

I had read some complaints about Tom Hanks in the role but I found him believable and acceptable. Ian McKellan is always an excellent villain and his portrayal of Sir Leigh Teabing is no different. Audrey Tautou is quite the shapeshifter in her roles. As Sophie she is soft with an underlying strength required for her character. But I didn't feel the chemistry the book has between her and Langton. Paul Bettany (forever my Chaucer) who plays the albino Silas was a bit of a disappointment to me. Even his whitening makeup was obvious in some scenes and the trademark eyes were missing.A very important scene at the end where Sophie reunites with her brother was not included. I think this was a pivotal reunion for Sophie's character. Her reunion with her grandmother was also anticlimactic. Sophie played a very small role in the discovery of the grail other than providing a personal history.

Personally, I could care less if Christ married and had children but I can also understand that this theory would drive groups like Opus Dei over the edge as this would make Christ less a deity and more a human being which would, on the positive side make Him more accessible to the 21st. century than does the porcelain statue planted in your local church.The basic plot of ""TDC"" is like a treasure hunt and though it is way too long by 20 minutes, there are genuine stretches of time when this film is absolutely fascinating. Unfortunately there are also stretches that are simply boring.Tom Hanks and particularly Audrey Tautou do a very good job of being tour guides through all the dogma, theory, superstition, facts and fiction of this film and its many divergent plot strains and ultimately they succeed in making the film interesting. But what this film really needs is a bona fide task master with a definite, concrete take and a subjective point of view like Robert Altman or Roman Polanski to judiciously edit this subject matter into a more cohesive whole. Ron Howard's downfall is that he tries to make a balanced, objective film and all this accomplishes is a film devoid of personality or pizazz: he tries to be all things to all people and ends up being nothing to anyone.As it is ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a good movie highlighted by two good central performances and an interesting premise that never really catches fire.",3,3 1/2 Stars: Mona Lisa Smiles,1148083200,"05 20, 2006",2006,1786,"['Ron', 'Howard', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'workmanlike', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'unusual', 'extraordinary', 'subject', 'more', 'interesting', 'better', 'realized', 'screen', 'presentation', 'Howard', 'screenwriter', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'provide.Let', 'face', 'theory', 'Christ', 'married', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'had', 'children', 'rife', 'controversy', 'many', 'levels', 'Personally', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'Christ', 'married', 'had', 'children', 'can', 'also', 'understand', 'theory', 'would', 'drive', 'groups', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'edge', 'would', 'make', 'Christ', 'less', 'deity', 'more', 'human', 'being', 'would', 'positive', 'side', 'make', 'Him', 'more', 'accessible', '21st', 'century', 'porcelain', 'statue', 'planted', 'local', 'church.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'TDC', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'way', 'too', 'long', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'genuine', 'stretches', 'time', 'when', 'film', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'also', 'stretches', 'are', 'simply', 'boring.Tom', 'Hanks', 'particularly', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'tour', 'guides', 'dogma', 'theory', 'superstition', 'facts', 'fiction', 'film', 'many', 'divergent', 'plot', 'strains', 'ultimately', 'succeed', 'making', 'film', 'interesting', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'bona', 'fide', 'task', 'master', 'definite', 'concrete', 'take', 'subjective', 'point', 'view', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'judiciously', 'edit', 'subject', 'matter', 'more', 'cohesive', 'whole', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'downfall', 'make', 'balanced', 'objective', 'film', 'film', 'devoid', 'personality', 'pizazz', 'be', 'things', 'people', 'up', 'being', 'nothing', 'anyone.As', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'good', 'movie', 'highlighted', 'two', 'good', 'central', 'performances', 'interesting', 'premise', 'never', 'really', 'catches', 'fire']",N/A

639899,A4RQ549E9K6B4,B00005JOC9,Michael S. Fleischer,"[3, 6]","Trailing the presumed journey of a pregnant Mary Magdalene westward to Gaul (now France), where she remained in hiding until her death from detractors intent on destroying the royal Davidic-Benjamite bloodline, the Da Vinci code casts new light on the formative years of Christianity. Like history, itself, the chronicled events may be less of an irrefutable record than a contrived compact--in this instance, one forged in a Nicean Council chamber, convened nearly seventeen hundred years ago by the pagan ""Christian"" convert, Constantine, and stakeholders intent on preserving their hegemony in a Roman Empire beleaguered by an emergent offshoot of messianic Judaism. Jesus' divinity, modeled on the more alluring and unifying mythologies of Mithras and the Osiris-Isis-Horus trinity mystery, produced a convenient consensus of ""facts"" that was vainly hoisted into posterity, accomplished by the surreptitious inclusion of the ""divine"" Gospels vis-&#65533;-vis exclusion of the humanistic and Gnostic accounts of the Christos.This is what, in so many words, Harvard symbology professor, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks, in a reserved and deliberate interpretation), asks Paris Police cryptologist, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou, who sparkles), an accessory to the macabre murder of her estranged grandfather, Louvre curator, Jacques Sauniere, to weigh in their fugitive flight from France to England that includes visits to Europe's most renowned museums and enigmatic sites such as London's Temple Church and Scotland's Rosslyn Chapel. In their effort to crack a 2000 year old conundrum that will clear their names of a charge manufactured and choreographed by ominous outside forces, we encounter some of the most nefarious souls you are likely meet in a fictionalized account of alternative history: An obsessed grail hunter and English expatriate, Sir Leigh Teabing (hammed to scrumptious perfection by Ian McKellen), with members of two warring religious orders. Ultra-conservative Opus Dei pairs a ""Javert-like"" Paris Police Detective, Bezu Fache (fastidiously played by Jean Reno), and his earthy associate, Lt. Collett, (Etienne Chicot, serving masterfully as the obsessed detective's foil), with the otherwordly, murderous albino Monk, Silas (Paul Bettany, in one of the most menacing and maniacal performances ever) and his scheming mentor, Bishop Aringarosa (fronted by the ever-reliable and talented Alfred Molina). With memorable, supporting performances by Jurgen Prochnow as the duplicitous Swiss Banker, Andre Vernet, and Jean-Yves Berteloot as Sir Leigh's shadowy confidant, Remy Jean, these characters are juxtaposed against the protagonists who, unwittingly, act on behalf of renegade latter-day, self-styled Templar guardians of the Priory of Sion. The former seeks to destroy the secrets the latter so desperately endeavors to preserve, if only to shield itself from the Church's iron hand. In the end, however, it is Langdon who exhorts to Sophie--and filmgoers--something they already know: ""The only thing that matters is what you believe.""Quipped as ""Harrison Ford in Harris Tweed,"" actor Tom Hank's cerebral Robert Langdon no more begs Harrison Ford's action-oriented Indiana Jones' than composer Hans Zimmer's subdued symphonic Renaissance score in director, Ron Howard's mystery-thriller, The Da Vinci Code, reminds us of John William's ""Souza-like"" crescendo to victory in directors Steven Spielberg's and John Lucas's cinematic comic strip, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the final chapter in their glossy '80's trilogy. Despite the parallels whereby the heroes contend with grail-obsessed villains, we meet two distinct personas in the leads, in two divergent film genres. They share only one thing in common: both are allegedly famous professors.Director Ron Howard and screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man) use artistic license to eliminate the sexual tension that author Dan Brown envisioned for the protagonists. Though missed, its replacement with a congenial father/daughter dynamic works--but less satisfactorily. It is probably a sensible solution given the age difference of the actors. The decision likely helped to streamline complexities in filmmaking, leaving us with what really matters most, anyway: A twisty plot populated with shady characters who threaten to derail the protagonists' quest for vindication and pursuit of ""truth."" All this is complemented with challenging puzzles wrapped in a provocative, world-class conspiracy. Plenty of fodder is crammed into this two-and-a-half-hour big budget feature, without burdening it with a superfluous romance.Back-story is nicely handled in light-saturated flashbacks. In some instances, screen graphics morph modern sites and cities into historical iterations, animated with ghostly specters. Interestingly, director Ron Howard humanizes Robert Langdon with bouts of claustrophobia. The emergence of this condition, we are shown in one such flashback, results from the seven-year-old's inexplicable fall into ""Samara Morgan's"" well--accomplished without viewing her harrowing videotape! This convention has been recurrently employed in a number of films such as The Ring and The Ring Two, Batman Begins, and modified into a rooftop water tower in Dark Water and a fiery alchemical abyss in Silent Hill. Langdon's dip into Jung's collective unconscious, and struggle upward, like the spirited ascent of Rachel Keller in the Ring series, effects a baptismal rise of the institutionally ""dead"" Sacred Feminine into living awareness and self-realization. Women have long been associated--multi-culturally--with wells, water, spirits, and the psyche. In the case of Robert Langdon, his soulful journey into the ""Well of Souls,"" like his Ring counterpart, Rachel Keller, was to forever change and influence his life and lifework.",4,Faith

639903,AUSATFDSU2INS,B00005JOC9,"milss ""Yellow hair warrior""","[104, 133]","The radical and controversial reaction caused by the movie The Da Vinci Code was to be expected since the moment director Ron Howard decided to make it, for in the last couple of years few books have generated such an extreme polemic reaction that, four years after its publication, seems like it will never end.My review will be limited to comment the movie, because it is not my intention to start a religious debate about the theories exposed in the novel. For me, The Da Vinci Code is just another fiction film, and as such, I will discuss it.The Da Vinci Code is one of those movies like Indiana Jones, The Mummy, etc., that combines adventure, history, mythologym mystery and action. The plot revolves around Harvard History/Symbology Professor Robert Langdon, French Cryptologist Sophie Neveau and their quest to discover the hidden clues left by the Louvre's Museum Curator before he was murdered by an Opus Dei Monk called Silas. These clues are part of a secret that -if revealed- would supposedly change the course of history: the truth about the Holy Grail. Of course, there will be allies for Langdon and Neveau in this journey, like an eccentric Englishman (the always fabulous Ian McKellen) and some detractors, an Opus Dei bishop (Alfred Molina), members of the Catholic Church, a French policeman (Jean Reno) and a secret ""master"" that desperately wants to uncover the truth.It's a long journey through history, religions, family secrets and complex puzzles and riddles. Screenwiter Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind) does a great job compressing the detailed narrative from Brown's book, allowing himself to take some liberties with the plot, which results in unexpected twists, but welcome ones.The characters in the movie are as plain as they are on the book, but each actor does the best they can with their parts. The exceptions are Sir Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany, whose characters are the richest and in consequence, the more interesting ones.The Da Vinci Code is a good thriller-adventure movie, filmed in gorgeous settings, starring a very attractive cast and enhanced with a score by Hans Zimmer. His contribution is most notorious and grateful in the last ten minutes, where Howard offers a respectful and almost reverential finale to Langdon's journey, and with that, a spectacular ending to a very entertaining movie.

How wrong they were. It's just an average movie. I don't even think Ron Howard was looking to write an Oscar winner here.The news media loved to play on controversy, and while doing that sparked curiosity among the public. Although it is better then 80% of the movies released this year (what a bad year for movies). The Da Vinci Code tends to be a mediocre film at best.First of all the dialogue is terrible. Tom Hanks(Robert Langdon) and Audrey Tautou ( Sophie Neveu) act with no feeling at all. Some of the lines sound a little forced. Rather then true expressions of feeling, you get a lame dialogue from  characters who seem to not give a dam. The scene in the Louvre bathroom made me want to retreat to the bathroom.The other major problem area is the story itself. This is one of those books that doesn't translate very well from book to movie. After certain events unfold, the movie then slows down to a screeching halt near the end, and when watching it you will probably be asking yourself, ""is it over yet."" I really didn't care much about finding the treasure or the character's boring search. If i was reading a book, i might seem more interested. Because as a booker reader I'm not expecting action packed suspense, but instead looking to solve a mystery.Most of the movie evolves around our characters going to one place to the next. The movie could have cut it short at certain points, but instead it drags us through the mud with more pointless clue finding. In fact the last shot of the film seemed pointless and was just an excuse to squeeze one last drop out of the thriller juice.Having said all that, the movie has some bright spots. Ron Howard has made a great working relationship with Paul Bettnay(Silas). He has a great cold demeanor and demonic look to him, with blue eyes that shine through his albino skin. He was really the most interesting character in the movie, as the others seemed to have no feeling at all. In a way you almost feel sorry for the character he portrays.Sir Ian Mckellem is also really good. I never expected him to provide comic relief. His acting adds at least a little salt to the dullness. I would say that he outperforms Hanks in every scene. I can't really think of a bad moment with McKellem in it.The other bright spot is the art direction itself. I love the brief flashbacks(both historical and personal), the ghostly visions of children and people, Hans Zimmer's score, the letters of code flashing before before Langdon's eyes(much like how the cryptic letters flashed before Nash's eyes in Beautiful Mind.)It's a decent flick and I would probably see it again.

While there are a few real action sequences, it felt like the characters were more or less taking their time at some points, and you forgot they were being chased.  There's also the fact that in the movie, Sophie Neveu doesn't seem to be doing much, unlike in the novel, which I found was a shame.  To finish on the con list, I though that the relationship between Neveu and Langdon doesn't evolve like it does in the book, where I thought there was a strong attraction between the two, which wasn't shown in the movie.Other than that, I didn't find it too dull or too long, and I didn't need to look at my watch after an hour wondering how long I had left.As for the casting, Ian Mckellen is superb.  I also enjoyed Audrey Tautou's performance, whom I was a little skeptical about but I found that she was a perfect fit.  Plus, she adds a certain charm to the character and even cracks a joke near the end, which I found was a good idea.As for Tom Hanks, I have to agree with critics that he wasn't necessarily the BEST choice for Robert Langdon, but I will say that he was a GOOD choice.  After seeing the movie I couldn't see anyone other than him playing Langdon.Overall, I think that it's an entertaining movie, which is what a summer flick like this should be.

Could Jesus and Mary Magdelene have been married? Could they have had children and have descendants amongst us today? Was Jesus more human than divine?The plot is so universally well known at this point, that I will condense it and focus the majority of this review on those questions. Havard Symbology Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to The Louvre in Paris to help decipher a serious of clues left by the curator, who has been mysteriously murdered. Before long, Langdon discovers that the Parisian police believe him to be the murderer, and he joins forces with the curators granddaughter, Spohie Noveau (Audrey Tatou) to get to the bottom of the mystery and, after meeting up with historian Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellan), discover that the murder involves a secret going all the way back to the time of Jesus.As to the controversy in question, I have this simple quote from Tom Hanks in the film that speaks for me and I believe, most Christians: ""Why couldn't Jesus have been a Father and still been capable of all those miracles?""To me, Jesus experiencing sexuality and having an actual life actually strengthens faith. It shows what he lost by giving his life on the cross: his wife, his child(ren), the life of a simple man, uninterrupted by significance and martyrdom.THE DAVINCI CODE combines a well-thought out murder mystery with these ideas, and for that, it should win the love and adoration of both film-fans and Christians all over the world.Also, once you watch THE DA VINCI CODE, immediately afterward, see THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST.

Unfortunately, the movie is rather dull and gets bogged down in the details.  Only the part of Sophie Neveu played by Audrey Tautou offers anything of redeeming value.  As has been pointed out by countless others, the movie is of course motivated by an anti-Christian conspiracy, allegations first spawned in the book _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_ that Mary Magdelene was the wife of Jesus Christ and that together they spawned a bloodline.  This Masonic conspiracy is further boistered up by hidden documents which supposedly revealed the presence of a secret society, the Priory of Sion, which existed to protect the bloodline.  The movie as the book gives way to all sorts of feminist goddess-worshipping nonsense and anti-Christian, anti-Catholic bigotry.  Opus Dei is portrayed as a sinister organization intent on suppressing the ""truth"" of the holy bloodline, but also easily led astray by Leigh Teabing (a name which is a convenient anagram of the writer of _HB/HG_, Baigent and his partner Leigh), the supposed Grail researcher.  Conveniently Brown never mentions in his book the good done by this organization, how it has led many to God and how it runs shelters for troubled youth, nor the good done by the Catholic church, giving way to every manner of anti-Catholic bigotry so popular in our culture today.  No!  This would all interfere with a good conspiracy story and we could not have that.  Ultimately however the movie fails on several levels.  It is overly long and gets boring in the middle.  Robert Langdon's character played by Tom Hanks comes across as easily confused and prone to claustrophobic fits.  The historical commentary (which there is much of) is almost all uniformly wrong or biased.  And the movie ends up being too much talk and not enough action.  For those of us who did read the book before (and it is nearly impossible not to have given its great proliferation), the movie is ultimately boring because we already know the story all-too-well and the few details which do not coincide with the book itself are rather trivial.  In sum, I believe I am justified in calling this a work of high kitsch which no doubt will enjoy great popularity among the many lost souls craving for something to believe in in this darkened world.",1,An Embarrassment to Symbolists.,1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,2398,"['_The', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code_', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'neo-Gnostic', 'mystery', 'tale', 'place', 'course', 'evening', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'rather', 'dull', 'bogged', 'down', 'details', 'Only', 'part', 'Sophie', 'Neveu', 'played', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'anything', 'redeeming', 'value', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'countless', 'others', 'movie', 'course', 'motivated', 'anti-Christian', 'conspiracy', 'allegations', 'first', 'spawned', 'book', '_Holy', 'Blood', 'Holy', 'Grail_', 'Mary', 'Magdelene', 'was', 'wife', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'together', 'spawned', 'bloodline', 'Masonic', 'conspiracy', 'further', 'boistered', 'up', 'hidden', 'documents', 'supposedly', 'revealed', 'presence', 'secret', 'society', 'Priory', 'Sion', 'existed', 'protect', 'bloodline', 'movie', 'book', 'way', 'sorts', 'feminist', 'goddess-worshipping', 'nonsense', 'anti-Christian', 'anti-Catholic', 'bigotry', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'portrayed', 'sinister', 'organization', 'intent', 'suppressing', 'truth', 'holy', 'bloodline', 'also', 'easily', 'led', 'astray', 'Leigh', 'Teabing', 'name', 'convenient', 'anagram', 'writer', '_HB/HG_', 'Baigent', 'partner', 'Leigh', 'supposed', 'Grail', 'researcher', 'Conveniently', 'Brown', 'never', 'mentions', 'book', 'good', 'done', 'organization', 'how', 'led', 'many', 'God', 'how', 'shelters', 'troubled', 'youth', 'good', 'done', 'Catholic', 'church', 'giving', 'way', 'manner', 'anti-Catholic', 'bigotry', 'so', 'popular', 'culture', 'today', 'No', 'would', 'interfere', 'good', 'conspiracy', 'story', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'Ultimately', 'however', 'movie', 'several', 'levels', 'overly', 'long', 'boring', 'middle', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'character', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'easily', 'confused', 'prone', 'claustrophobic', 'fits', 'historical', 'commentary', 'much', 'almost', 'uniformly', 'wrong', 'biased', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'too', 'much', 'talk', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'who', 'did', 'read', 'book', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'not', 'have', 'given', 'great', 'proliferation', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'boring', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'all-too-well', 'few', 'details', 'do', 'not', 'coincide', 'book', 'are', 'rather', 'trivial', 'sum', 'believe', 'am', 'justified', 'calling', 'work', 'high', 'kitsch', 'doubt', 'will', 'enjoy', 'great', 'popularity', 'many', 'lost', 'souls', 'craving', 'something', 'believe', 'darkened', 'world']",N/A

The makers of the Harry Potter and LOTR movies generally pleased the book fans, whereas the makers of Troy, Dinotopia, and War of the Worlds have not pleased the book fans.  This being said, making a movie on a controversial book is an even greater risk, and The Da Vinci Code is probably one of the more controversial books to appear in the English language in the past 10 years.  But the makers of the movie did their homework alright.  First, they gathered a good cast of actors and actresses, including two of the best in Tom Hanks and Ian McKellen.  Second, they made sure to use actors that reflected the nationalities of the characters in the book.  Third, they picked a great composer to make an original soundtrack.  And last, Ron Howard was a great choice as a director.  The result is one of the best movies of 2006.I have never read the book, but I can say that this movie is very engaging and interesting.  The story starts with the killing of an important person who knows a very important secret.  The rest of the movie proceeds as a series of secrets being unraveled, with the audience finding out as the protagonists find out.  The movie ends with the female lead discovering her true identity, and the male lead finding the final resting place of Mary Magdalene.  In between are many well-done episodes of suspense, action, comedy, and drama.  The dialogue is quite good and shows each character to have a depth of experience and a complex range of drives and emotions.  The special effects are also quite good, and at numerous times, flashbacks are made to important acts in history.  These look quite impressive.This DVD set comes with multiple special features including interviews with all the principal actors and actresses.  There are also features on the soundtrack, the book, and of course, interviews with the book's author.

639927,A1D3XQC2DIT,B00005JOC9,Peter Shermeta,"[4, 10]","Harvard professor Robert Langdon was dragged into a religious conflict that dated back a few millenniums. He and French Cryptographer Sophie Neveu had work together to follow the path toward the answers. Conflicts arose from many sources: the figurative path to follow was not known, neither were the questions whose answers are sought, and Robert Langdon was wanted for murder. In a surprising turn of events, the path begano reveal itself in religious lore and a few of Leonardo Da Vinci's works.I cannot say how enjoyable the movie would be to someone who has not read the book, or at least read it recently. I had just finished reading the book about two weeks before I saw the movie at the theater. Many things were different. In my opinion, too many things were different. There were so many intricate details pieced together in the book that had to be removed for the sake of time that left enormous holes. Some of the holes were patched with movie-specific details, but they were not as good.I believe that, for the most part, people prefer whichever came first, reading the book or seeing the movie. It becomes a reference point against which the other is measured and many differences seem too great to overcome. Having read the book first, I cannot tell you if the book is worth reading after seeing the movie. I can tell you, however, the movie was not worth seeing after reading the book.A friend of mine made a fantastic point that summed up the difference between the two mediums perfectly. He said, ""The book was much more Indiana Jones than the movie."" On paper, the story had much more mystery and suspense. Almost none of it translated onto the big screen.He and I differed in our opinions of Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. I cannot speak for his reasons, but he thought Hanks was good for the part. I thought it was a poor casting choice. Additionally, he sounded like he did back in the 80s; the sound is as if hearing his own voice delivering the words is a surprise to him. (Think about it.)The dialogue in the movie was horribly forced. It was a long string of forced cues. To be able to explain what was happening, without the luxury to include a chapter of text, writers built all-too-convenient verbal cues. One character, seemingly out of the blue, would ask another something completely unrelated to the current conversation and then the second person would feign surprise and explain how it all ties together. Compare this exactly to when you try to coerce another person to answer a question to which you already know the answer. (I don't think I explained that very well, but it was the best I can do.)If you have read The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, especially recently, I do not recommend you see the movie.

He and Silas were from Opus Dei, the Catholic group that wanted to suppress the secret which the Priory was (supposedly) threatening to release. On that note, I actually sort of liked Bettany's acting as Silas. Not so much the self-torture, but he kept it interesting sometimes.

(I jumped as well, only because they screamed -- watching enough Harry Potter/Pirates of the Caribbean/Narnia-type films usually cures your jumping instinct). My uncle said Ian McKellen only took his role because of his insane ranting near the end of the film, because he is anti-Christian. I don't know if that's true, and I don't care, because whatever McKellen's motivation, I'm glad he took the part.On a small closing note, I would simply like to mention that I am Catholic and I haven't been offended by anything in the novel or the film because they are all FICTION.

One of course has to consider that the movie was competing with a extremelly successful book that everyone (despite if someone like it or not) had read it or had knowledge of it.

Having said that Ron Howard directed this film very well but I think that Tom Hanks was miscast for the leading role.

639931,A2CMYX10636NG2,B00005JOC9,Portia,"[20, 29]","....who single-handedly kept me interested in this movie, until the moment he disappeared from the plot- and his absence was greatly felt.First of all, let me say that I have read this book... it entertained me on the train several years ago from Venice to Rome and honestly, the first thing I thought when I put it down was: ""this will make quite a good movie."" Imagine my disappointment, however, when the movie turned out to be merely mediocre, and a good half-hour too long.I realize that this is a film review, and I am going to review the film (I promise) but first, let me say that as far as the controversy surrounding this film goes, I am slightly amused by the psychological grip this story now holds over lovers and haters of it alike. First of all, in both the book and film, the huge historical plot-holes that exist are difficult to ignore. I overlooked them in the book, as I had purchased it in the ""Fiction"" section and decided to take it on its word. However, seeing the same historical errors repeated in the film were a little jarring. Perhaps my gripe is that if Ron Howard wanted to present a vaguely preposterous conspiracy story about the Holy Grail, he should have done so with no apologies, no inhibitions,  and above all, in the same spirit as the director of X-Men or Star Wars must: giving the appearance of history, but never ever forgetting (or letting your audience forget) that what you are presenting is fictitious.Ron Howard's direction of this film feels almost tentative... he knows what he is presenting is controversial, and instead of taking the ""I'm making a film about a fiction book, take it as it is!"" route, he instead almost apologizes for his film, as if to say ""I realize this is all very controversial and touchy and a lot of you are probably going to hate me for this, but I'm still going to put it out there."" In short, the whole film  takes itself far too seriously.As a student of history and interested reader of books on the early church and Germanic literature and lore of Grail myth alike, I am disappointed that the movie could not have been done as a simple historical Star Wars-like epic.... totally fictitious, but therein lies its charm.Unfortunately, I suppose, that could never have really been done as there is far, FAR too much controversy surrounding this plot already. It is sad that so few of today's readers and filmgoers are versed enough in their history to know that Dan Brown's book, and consequently, Ron Howard's film, are simply interesting fictitious representations of myths and conspiracies that are already a bit worn. ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" presented these ideas years ago, and the bogus Priory of Sion is a well-known hoax created by Pierre Plantard in the 1930's.Also, would everyone please just go and do a couple things for me? Please look up the Dead Sea Scrolls and see if they mention an alternate Jesus story, or even Jesus at all. (Hint: the Dead Sea Scrolls contain OLD Testament documents, predating Jesus by thousands of years... oops.) Also, read up on your Council of Nicea history. Without going into detail, let's just say that they didn't compile the Bible at it.Also, without going into more of the many, many historically innacurate ""facts"" of The DaVinci Code in great depth, may I present an interesting point to all you Biblical scholars out there. Part of Teabing and Langdon's arguments in the story that support Mary Magdalen's marriage to Christ involve her famous anointing of his feet with perfume... in fact, this image of the prostrate Magdalen wiping Christ's feet with her hair is a familiar one. Well, I would challenge you to locate a copy of any standard volume of the New Testament and turn to the Gospel of John, chapter 12 verses 1-3. You will find the Biblical account of this anointing, and if you read closely, the thing that you might find troubling is that the Mary in these verses is not Mary of Magdelen at all, but Mary of Bethany- the sister of Martha and Lazarus. How many more Biblical and historical errors occur in this plot? Part of the fun is locating them for yourself.Ultimately, some good acting and interesting cinematography as well as the creative, mystery-like plot itself earned this film 3 stars in my estimation. What I think is ironic is how many people are so genuinely alarmed that other people are accepting The DaVinci Code as historical fact and will be spiritually misled. What mostly alarms me is that people have become so lazy as scholars that we can no longer enjoy truly intriguing historical fiction, as Dan Brown has given us, because there is always the possibility that someone is going to be uneducated enough to accept it all wholeheartedly as truth.",3,thank God for Sir Ian McKellen.....,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,4715,"['.who', 'single-handedly', 'kept',

Nearly every bad review is from someone bashing the story because of its ""conspiracy theories"". I'm going to right a review that's not based on that.The book is very good. The story is engaging, whether or not you believe it and are willing to just enjoy it as a story, and everything moves along at an exciting and thrilling pace. I thought that it would make a perfect movie, and I still believe it COULD.However, the movie was, in my opinion, a disaster. Although the plot follows very closely with the book, it's just not very fun to watch. Everything about it feels rushed, and it felt like they filmed it in two days. The pacing is terrible - the rushed feeling does not contribute to the ""thriller"" aspect of it, it just feels like they didn't care about making a good movie. The acting is also quite horrendous. Tom Hanks usually does a great job, but he was an awful choice for this movie. He is to old for the part, and did not feel genuine in his performance. The directing is below average. The effects are pretty decent. In fact, the only things that were well done.I'm rating the movie three stars because it did not feel like a TOTAL waste of time. It does compliment the book, but by itself it is simply not worth watching, especially for $20. While watching in theaters I was only intrigued by the story, as I had forgotten a lot since reading the book and it refreshed my memory. The ending was also a little better than the book in concept, but the bad acting and directing still applied.If you're interested in this film, please do yourself a favor and rent it first. If you like it enough, buy it. Otherwise, you could just read the book and hope that another version will be released in a few years that's done better.",3,"Great Story, Horrible Execution",1164240000,"11 23, 2006",2006,1936,"['have', 'noticed', 'majority', 'reviews', 'movie', 'positive', 'negative', 'tend', 'focus', 'not', 'enjoy', 'actual', 'story', 'believe', 'things', 'movie', 'deals', 'Nearly', 'bad', 'review', 'someone', 'bashing', 'story', 'conspiracy', 'theories', ""'m"", 'going', 'right', 'review', 'not', 'based', 'that.The', 'book', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'engaging', 'not', 'believe', 'are', 'willing', 'just', 'enjoy', 'story', 'everything', 'moves', 'along', 'exciting', 'thrilling', 'pace', 'thought', 'would', 'make', 'perfect', 'movie', 'still', 'believe', 'COULD.However', 'movie', 'was', 'opinion', 'disaster', 'plot', 'very', 'closely', 'book', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'fun', 'watch', 'Everything', 'rushed', 'felt', 'filmed', 'two', 'days', 'pacing', 'terrible', 'rushed', 'feeling', 'not', 'contribute', 'thriller', 'aspect', 'just', 'feels', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'making', 'good', 'movie', 'acting', 'also', 'quite', 'horrendous', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'usually', 'great', 'job', 'was', 'awful', 'choice', 'movie', 'old', 'part', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'genuine', 'performance', 'directing', 'below', 'average', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', 'fact', 'only', 'things', 'were', 'well', 'done.I', ""'m"", 'rating', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'TOTAL', 'waste', 'time', 'compliment', 'book', 'simply', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', '20', 'watching', 'theaters', 'was', 'only', 'intrigued', 'story', 'had', 'forgotten', 'lot', 'reading', 'book', 'refreshed', 'memory', 'ending', 'was', 'also', 'little', 'better', 'book', 'concept', 'bad', 'acting', 'directing', 'still', ""'re"", 'interested', 'film', 'please', 'do', 'favor', 'rent', 'first', 'like', 'enough', 'buy', 'Otherwise', 'could', 'just', 'read', 'book', 'hope', 'version', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'few', 'years', 'done', 'better']",N/A

Jesus could have been married; he was a man after all.""Another Christian I watched this movie with said: ""The whole movie is a lie. The only thing true about it was that Da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa.""Well, I'm not Christian. I found it quite entertaining and engaging (I especially liked the historical recreations and memory-sequences), but then again it wasn't my religion that was being picked apart on the big screen. And not all of it is a lie...MALLEUS MALEFICARUM is a real book that was used as a guide in killing hundreds of thousands of women, free-thinkers, and pretty much anyone the church didn't like. Check it out on Amazon, if you're interested.A lot of critics seem to hate this movie. Could it be because most of them are Christians?I've read critics' reviews where they complain about the length of the movie (it was interesting throughout), the fact that it's too talky (what's wrong with that?), and pretentious (why? because it picks apart Christianity, like Christianity has done to virtually every other religion in the world?).What I'm trying to say is this: just because you disagree with the message of the movie, does not mean that the movie itself is not well-made. What's so bad about recognizing the feminine divine in Christianity, anyway?...Gods know that Christianity needs some balance when it comes to the female part of the species.The movie follows the book basically word for word, for those who are interested. While I think the book was more exciting, the movie was still very good.Overall, it was an interesting movie that held me captivated for the most part.

With such an indication that this was truly heinous stuff, I naturally had to go see it.But I'm not convinced, that instead of Father, Son and Holy Spirit we should instead worship Father, Mother and Holy Buggery.  This is just more of the fluff-peddlers in the entertainment business, trying to sell their holistic, new age, pagan, or what-have-you version of reality, something we really only had since the hippies went wild in the 1960's.Instead, I'll go on the way I was.  His truth is marching on.  Jesus was a devout Jew, and would never let a simple woman from the crowd pervert his teachings regarding the Kingdom of One God into some warmed-over fertility cult.  His people had enough trouble with all of that when they were up against the Canaanites.There's decent action in the film; it has plenty of general cinematic value, so I'll grade it 4.4 stars, though I did want to get up to go get a hot dog and hang around in the lounge, about 50 minutes in.  Tom Hanks is out of place, I'll observe, you'd think he'd be running after Meg Ryan, instead of his gnostic little sweetheart who does not know who she's purported to be.But teach me about Christ, and reveal a true Gospel?

Especially since he had a guaranteed box-office success no matter what he did, considering the success of the book and the controversy surrounding it.Ron Howard could have made a bland action flick that avoided the controversial religious claims, or he could have made a romantic comedy with a stupid French policeman, or he could have cut the number of locations and codes by 50%, or he could have done all sorts of things.In fact, Ron Howard took the book seriously, and the movie, although not following the book slavishly, does include most of the controversial claims from the book. I think he did the right thing and that the movie has a more memorable impact as a result.Just about everyone has noted that the movie is rather long (2 1/2 hours) and contains a lot of dialog. But this is a direct consequence of taking the book seriously.The movie is well-made, the actors (especially Ian McKellen) all do a good job, the action scenes are exciting, the locations are beautifully photographed, and you leave the cinema feeling that you got your money's worth. This is especially true if you disliked the book because of the religious claims and went to see the movie to get your feeling of outrage about these claims confirmed.Anyway, I liked the movie.

This movie was destroyed by critics long before the film reached the average theatre and many refuse to see it because of the enormous ""controversy"". If you will honestly be offended by any subject about Jesus (GASP!) then by all means stay away, but let me inform you that the film in no way forces religion down your throat and the film is...well..Fiction...The other crowd of doubters may say the film will stray from the beloved book, but I think this is what critics hated about the film... The Da Vinci Code is almost an exact translation from book to film! The plot remains intact and I think people were upset there wasn't much creative input from the minds of Hanks or Howard. The plot, for those who don't already know, follows a symbologist named Robert Langdon (played fantastically by Mr. Hanks) who is asked to help solve a murder scene involving symbols. When he arrives, a young female detective, Sophie Neveu, informs him that he is a suspect, and he agrees to help her follow the clues left on the dead body he had been asked to inspect. The clues lead them on an age old quest for the holy grail, previously hidden by the Knights Templar. This quest becomes more dangerous than expected when a secret Catholic Brotherhood sends an albino monk(a creepy Paul Bettany)to kill Langdon and Nevue for the location of the grail. The grail in the book and movie is a secret so great it would destroy the foundations of the Catholic Church, and the Church will make sure the grail is not found. A suspenseful cat and mouse chase follows between the French Police, the albino, Langdon and Neveu, and Langdon's cripple friend Leigh Teabing(a typical Ian McKellen). With historic locations such as the Lovre as a backdrop, some jump-out-of-your-seat suspense, a few puzzle solving segments, and tons of making-of featurettes, This is a good DVD that will top any other thriller you could watch come Friday night.",4,The Da Vinci Code Decoded,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,2041,"['many', 'are', 'reading', 'reviews', 'will', 'probably', 'see', 'mediocre', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'film', 'movie', 'was', 'destroyed', 'critics', 'long', 'film', 'reached', 'average', 'theatre', 'many', 'refuse', 'see', 'enormous', 'controversy', 'will', 'honestly', 'be', 'offended', 'subject', 'Jesus', 'GASP', 'then', 'means', 'stay', 'away', 'let', 'inform', 'film', 'way', 'religion', 'down', 'throat', 'film', 'well..Fiction', 'other', 'crowd', 'doubters', 'may', 'say', 'film', 'will', 'stray', 'beloved', 'book', 'think', 'what', 'critics', 'hated', 'film', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'almost', 'exact', 'translation', 'book', 'film', 'plot', 'intact', 'think', 'people', 'were', 'upset', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'creative', 'input', 'minds', 'Hanks', 'Howard', 'plot', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'symbologist', 'named', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'played', 'fantastically', 'Mr.', 'Hanks', 'who', 'asked', 'help', 'solve', 'murder', 'scene', 'involving', 'symbols', 'When', 'young', 'female', 'detective', 'Sophie', 'Neveu', 'suspect', 'help', 'follow', 'clues', 'left', 'dead', 'body', 'had', 'been', 'asked', 'inspect', 'clues', 'lead', 'age', 'old', 'quest', 'holy', 'grail', 'previously', 'hidden', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'quest', 'more', 'dangerous', 'expected', 'when', 'secret', 'Catholic', 'Brotherhood', 'albino', 'monk', 'creepy', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'kill', 'Langdon', 'Nevue', 'location', 'grail', 'grail', 'book', 'movie', 'secret', 'so', 'great', 'would', 'destroy', 'foundations', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Church', 'will', 'make', 'sure', 'grail', 'not', 'found', 'suspenseful', 'cat', 'mouse', 'chase', 'French', 'Police', 'albino', 'Langdon', 'Neveu', 'Langdon', 'cripple', 'friend', 'Leigh', 'Teabing', 'typical', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'historic', 'locations', 'such', 'Lovre', 'backdrop', 'jump-out-of-your-seat', 'suspense', 'few', 'puzzle', 'solving', 'segments', 'tons', 'making-of', 'featurettes', 'good', 'DVD', 'will', 'top', 'other', 'thriller', 'could', 'watch', 'come', 'Friday', 'night']",N/A
639939,A2TBWLOHTZNK54,B00005JOC9,Reviewer,"[6, 13]","Sadly, this is barely a film worth watching. Unless you don't know the controversial premise of the book already, everything in the film reeked of simply filling in the blanks of a very long action novel into movie format. The lines are often so bad that characters repeat something someone else just said in the form of a question. I haven't read the book, but if those lines are verbatim it was a mistake to not more carefully craft a movie script.Beyond the pea brain level of the dialogue, there's another major problem. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou are cast as the leads in a suspenseful action film where their lives will be on the line most of the movie. Both of the actors look utterly miscast the whole time, like they want to do something comedic since that's their strength, but since they can't in such a role they don't say much of anything original or expressive at all. It seems like there was both a large casting mistake and lack of directorial support for these against type leads to boot. That means the viewer gets to follow the adventures of two people who don't even belong in this setting or know how to act, in addition to them only reciting very simple dialogue and jumping through action movie hoops.Some people say this movie is religiously controversial... I almost find that notion laughable. This film is bad, and the interesting twist on religious history it talks about was cool, but who on earth cares? Why would fiction this mainstream and simplistic be seriously controversial? I feel like I've been through a hundred bad films and books just like this, so I find the hype and controversy to be bull in this case.

Indeed, ""Gone With the Wind"" was bought and put into production almost immediately after its publication in 1937. That was a tough book to film, and came out fine. Dan Brown's ""The DaVinci Code"" must've also been tough to film, if only for the protests that surrounded it. I applaud anyone who comes up with a new idea regarding anything. Certainly, filmmakers have been fascinated with such conundrums as the origin of the universe, life on other planets, the end of the world, re-structuring other cultures, etc. That Ron Howard had the courage to tackle this controversial book, with an equally courageous screenplay treatment by Akiva Goldsman, is NOT to be dismissed. It is merely an interpretation of an alternative idea, including the hate-mongers who will suppress those ideas. I give Mr. Howard & Mr. Goldsman credit for this creative effort. The plot has a few holes, and certainly will offend ""by-the-book"" Christians, but, as filmmaking, it succeeds quite well. The film itself is very talky, requires concentration, and has a lot of slow moments that will annoy the average American filmgoer. At 149 minutes, it tells a tale that is far-fetched at first then grabs our attention, mostly because of the excellent acting from all involved. Indeed, Ian McKellan may finally receive a long overdue Oscar, if the Academy can remember that far back. Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Paul Bettany, Jean Reno, Alfred Molina, Jurgen Prochnow...this is A-List casting, and none disappointed. I was also impressed with the editing, which kept the film taut and interesting at all times, allowing the slow moments to prepare the viewer for the excitement that follows.

grand symbological mutli-million unit selling mystery novel(released in 2003)or not,is really of no consequence.The Roman Catholic Church whose foundation his novel questions was none too pleased at the time and(typical of the Church)issued memos to its' flock not to either read the book nor attend the subsequent movie's release.Of course,according to the Church,it was all bogus from beginning to end.Me thinks they did protest too much!The movie takes Brown's writings and brings them to the screen in an intelligent and attractive manner all served up(and there is ALOT to serve up!)in a fast paced and unrelenting style that keeps you glued to the screen from the beginning to the very end.The Da Vinci Code(released May/06) involves the story of a symbologist/cryptonalyst by the name of Robert Langdon(Tom Hanks).He is giving a lecture in Paris and attends a book signing after when he is approached by the police,one Capt.Fache(Jean Reno),to assist them in a murder that has just been committed in the Louvre.It turns out to be a friend of Langdon's by the name of Sauniere and the body has many mysterious symbols about it.Landon doesn't know it but the police captain suspects him of doing the dirty deed.A police cryptologist Sophie Neveu(Audrey Tautou)arrives and gets Langdon alone.He is in danger she says and must leave and moreover the man who was murdered was her grandfather.They escape and head to a bank with a key her grandfather left to her.It is a key to a safety deposit box which contains a small wooden box,in which is a cryptex.It is a cylindrical container surrounded with letters that must be arranged in a certain way to open it successfully.If not done properly a vial inside releases a potion of vinegar which destroys the contents.From here the pair seek out a Holy Grail expert-friend of Langdon's ,a Mr Teabing(Ian McKellan).They discuss the ins and outs of the Grail and the Church's earliest days and beginnings,right back to Christ himself and whether he was supernatural or just a man,when the police track them down.They all escape to London with the French police captain still in pursuit.In London Langdon(assisted throughout by Neveu) tracks down an important clue to locate the Grail but they are confronted by Teabing who wants the box and cryptex it contains.Langdon turns away to try and decode the cryptex but when he turns back he throws it into the air which cracks the inner vile and destroys the contents.At this moment the police enter and Teabing is arrested,not Landon nor Neveu.It seems the French captain has been played for a dupe by the dark shadows of the Church who also want the Grail's location and he has come to his senses.Well,it turns out Langdon did indeed crack the code and has the parchment paper from inside.In it the directions lead them both to a Church in the countryside of England where they find that the Grail they seek was indeed once there but has been moved.However they also find the guardians of the Grail,a group dedicated to preserving the Grail and its' location.We also find out the Grail was/is Neveu herself;as she is from a royal blood line descended from Christ himself through Mary Magdeline his wife.The movie ends with much of the clues that have inundated Langdon's mind throughout his arduous journey,coming together and him walking to the front of the Louvre museum in Paris and kneeling and praying over the spot where the bodily remains of Mary Magdeline secretly lay.The movie moves along at breakneck speed and  makes brief stops for the viewers to catch their collective breaths and try and take in much of what is going on before them.There are alot of clues and alot of information to digest here.But in the end the ultimate conflict here is again wrapped around a good guys-bad guys scenario.On the bad guy side is the Opus Dei depicted here as a shadowy form of the Vatican that is trying to keep hidden and even search out and destroy any vestige or hint of the Grail,i.e. the remains of Mary Magdeline and a possible bloodline.On the good side we have the keepers of the faith with the Priory of Scion and their more well known arm the Knights Templar.These guardians(and their many descendants)have fought the good fight for centuries in order to keep the truth alive,but hidden from harms way,i.e the Vatican.Brown's novel and the resultant movie never preach their story to us and let us make our own minds up.As I said before this story is based on old historical fact mixed with legends and the resultant extrapolations of the two.Near the end of the movie a conversation between Langdon and Neveu really says it all about the novel,movie and their goal.Langdon asks Neveu would revealing herself as a direct descendant of Christ bring about destruction of the Church or a new reconnaissance of it? Intriguing question to an intriguing....theory? Open minds is what it is all about.This movie is one of Ron Howard's better efforts and deserves high praise for his deft handling of the complex material.The movie contains a solid roster of actors from Hanks,McKellan to French star Jean Reno and Germany's Jurgen Prochnow.Paul Bettany as Silas does a great turn as a conflicted and tortured puppet of the Opus Dei's bidding.Technically the movie is presented in its original 2:40:1 aspect ratio and has been transferred wonderfully,sound included.Extras abound in this two disc set.We have featurettes ""Filmmakers Journey Pt's 1 & 2"",Music of the DC"",a DC demo DVD game,""Portrait of Langdon"",""Who is Sophie Neveu?"",""The Usual Suspects"",""Magical Places"",""Close up of the Mona Lisa"",a discussion with Dan Brown,first day on the set

intriguing thriller/novel brought deftly to the big screen by Ron Howard and now to DVD,in a fast 141 minutes.It's a solid cast and a highly recommended film worthy of repeated viewings to catch many of the clues that you may have missed the first time.Enjoy.",4,"4 1/2 stars for an intriguing look at our relgious ""foundations""",1275177600,"05 30, 2010",2010,6243,"['Whether', 'not', 'believe',

That's the real mystery here.  This piece of film fiction is NOT a lecture or a documentary it just feels like one.By taking itself way too seriously, the filmmaking conspirators destroyed the fun of the ride.The audacious premise may be blasphemy to some and heresy to others.  But the real unforgivable sin here is that the movie is boring.Even Tom Hanks said it's just a movie about a bunch of ""religious hooey.""  But the sin of the filmmakers is that by trying to stick to the letter of the book and not the mood, wrecked the story and it got off track on its way to becoming a movie -- and the film derailed.That said, the movie version of Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" works best for those who buy into the hoopla and publicity and still think the book is factual and not clever fiction.  It's kind of like those great speculative recreations on the History Channel.Brian Grazer is an astute producer who often has his finger on the pop culture pulse and Ron Howard is a gifted director, but here they were unable -- or afraid -- to boldly guide Akiva Goldsman's screenplay away from the novel and into a blueprint that would make the breathless page-turner a disturbing, edge-of-your-seat thriller.If you're interested in the dark side of the Catholic Church, check out the non-fiction books ""The Bad Popes"" by E.R.

christian community, you would have thought that dan brown was the devil himself and that ron howard was his 'minion'...but, as a christian, i can easily say that, there is really nothing to be afraid of here...taken as a movie by itself, it's really well-done, and i like the fact that they didn't try to emphasize a 'relationship' between hanks and tautou...some critics scoffed at their 'chemistry', but i think that enhanced the picture, by having us concentrate on these two uncovering the clues, rather than each other...and, as far as 'da vinci' goes, i was a little surprised that they didn't actually delve more into da vinci's true beliefs, as well as all the 'codes' he placed within his paintings...(his 'madonna on the rocks' is worthy of an entire film in itself...)and, the characters do make it known that, maybe this isn't exactly what they believe or what is real, but instead, that there are people who definitely do believe it, and feel it's worth killing for...now, granted, some argue that, people will be 'influenced' by the film, and not understand the 'truth'...granted, but that's sadly the way it is with most things in our society nowadays, and i don't think, with the way ron howard skillfully directed this flick, that anybody would go away with a sense of specifics...questions perhaps, but no specifics...and if you are so concerned about their questions, have some answers ready...and make sure you don't make the same mistake that most 'christians' made by just screaming out 'LIES, LIES, LIES'...because, this isn't all lies...it's actually quite true that da vinci (as well as alot of sects currently around the world), did, and do, believe in many proposals that are brought up in the film (as well as some that were left behind)...yes, they go against what the bible says, and what many christians believe to be true, but you must make that line clear, rather than making it look like there's something to 'cover up'...people have believed what they want to believe for centuries, and, regardless of how you percieve it, that doesn't make a film about it bad...it just makes you 'step up to the plate' when someone needs to know the truth...look

639961,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JOC9,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 5]","***1/2From the way the critics have gone after ""The Da Vinci Code,"" you'd think that Ron Howard himself had been jealously guarding the location of the Holy Grail all these years and was just now revealing it to all the world for his own nefarious (i.e. commercial) purposes.  Actually, despite all the critical hostility and rancor, this turns out to be a reasonably entertaining adaptation of a reasonably entertaining novel, far from a classic or a work of art, but hardly the pile of cinematic refuse so many of the reviewers have led us to believe it is.As a work of history, the novel is a passel of nonsense, and only those with a bent towards conspiracy theory overload would be foolish enough to believe a minute of it.  But as a work of imaginative fiction, ""The Da Vinci Code"" certainly gives its audience the neck-twisting workout they've paid good money to receive.It would be pointless to reiterate the plot of a novel that has probably had the biggest readership of any literary work since ""Gone With the Wind.""  Suffice it to say that a mysterious murder in the Louvre sends a Harvard symbologist and the dead man's granddaughter on a clue-driven search for the famed Holy Grail.  Along the way, the two uncover a grand conspiracy on the part of a renegade Catholic order to protect a secret that, if it were revealed, could shake the whole of Western civilization down to its very foundations.Despite the phenomenal - one is tempted to say ""unprecedented"" - commercial success of his work, Dan Brown is no great shakes as a writer; his characters are, almost without exception, drab and two-dimensional, and his dialogue, when it isn't being overly explicit in pouring out explanations, sounds like it was written by a first-year student in a Writer's 101 workshop.  But the one undeniable talent Brown does have is his ability to knit together a preposterously complex web of codes and clues into an airtight tapestry, and to make it all convincing.The movie is very faithful to the novel in this respect.  It moves quickly from location to location, never giving us too much time to question the logic (or illogic) of the narrative or to examine the many gaping plot holes in any great detail.  Writer Akiva Goldsman has encountered his greatest trouble in the scenes in which the action stops dead in its tracks so that the characters can lay out in laborious detail the elaborate story behind the clues.  Yet, this is as much the fault of the nature and design of the novel as it is of the man given the unenviable task of bringing it to the screen.  Moreover, perhaps in the interest of time and keeping the action flowing, Robert and Sophie come up with solutions to the myriad riddles much too quickly and accurately, with a ""Golly, gee, could it mean_______?"" attitude that borders on the ludicrous.  But, somehow, Howard makes most of it work.  Perhaps, it's the clunky literal-minded earnestness with which he approaches the subject that ultimately allows us to buy into it against our better judgment.Tom Hanks is stolid and passive as Dr. Robert Langdon, the college professor involuntarily driven into all this cloak-and-dagger intrigue, but Audrey Tautou has a certain subtle charm as Sophie, the woman who may play more of a part in the unraveling of the mystery than even she herself can imagine.  Jean Reno and Paul Bettany have their moments as two of the less savory players in the story, but it is Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on all things related to the Holy Grail, who walks off with the film.  His scenery-chewing shtick pumps some much needed life into a tale essentially populated by underdeveloped stick figures.The religious controversy surrounding both the novel and the film is as ludicrous as it is unjustified.  Anyone whose belief system could be seriously shaken by this absurd mixture of unsubstantiated myth-making and plain old-fashioned wild speculation couldn't have had a very solid foundation of faith to begin with.The rest of us can appreciate ""The Da Vinci Code"" for what it is, an overblown but epic exercise in code-busting and clue-decoding - in short, the ""Gone With the Wind"" of whodunits.",3,better than what many critics say,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,4171,"['way', 'critics', 'have', 'gone', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', ""'d"", 'think', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'had', 'been', 'jealously', 'guarding', 'location', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'years', 'was', 'just', 'now', 'revealing', 'world', 'own', 'nefarious', 'i.e', 'commercial', 'purposes', 'Actually', 'critical', 'hostility', 'rancor', 'out', 'be', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'adaptation', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'novel', 'far', 'classic', 'work', 'art', 'hardly', 'pile', 'cinematic', 'refuse', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'led', 'believe', 'is.As', 'work', 'history', 'novel', 'passel', 'nonsense', 'only', 'bent', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'overload', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'enough', 'believe', 'minute', 'work', 'imaginative', 'fiction', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'certainly', 'audience', 'neck-twisting', 'workout', ""'ve"", 'paid', 'good', 'money', 'receive.It', 'would', 'be', 'pointless', 'reiterate', 'plot', 'novel', 'probably', 'had', 'biggest', 'readership', 'literary', 'work', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'say', 'mysterious', 'murder', 'Louvre', 'Harvard', 'symbologist', 'dead', 'man', 'granddaughter', 'clue-driven', 'search', 'famed', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'way', 'two', 'grand', 'conspiracy', 'part', 'renegade', 'Catholic', 'order', 'protect', 'secret', 'were', 'revealed', 'could', 'shake', 'whole', 'Western', 'civilization', 'down', 'very', 'foundations.Despite', 'phenomenal', 'one', 'tempted', 'say', 'unprecedented', 'commercial', 'success', 'work', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'great', 'shakes', 'writer', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'exception', 'drab', 'two-dimensional', 'dialogue', 'when', ""n't"", 'being', 'overly', 'explicit', 'pouring', 'out', 'explanations', 'was', 'written', 'first-year', 'student', 'Writer', '101', 'workshop', 'one', 'undeniable', 'talent', 'Brown', 'have', 'ability', 'knit', 'together', 'preposterously', 'complex', 'web', 'codes', 'clues', 'airtight', 'tapestry', 'make', 'convincing.The', 'movie', 'very', 'faithful', 'novel', 'respect', 'quickly', 'location', 'location', 'never', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'question', 'logic', 'illogic', 'narrative', 'examine', 'many', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'great', 'detail', 'Writer', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'encountered', 'greatest', 'trouble', 'scenes', 'action', 'dead', 'tracks', 'characters', 'can', 'lay', 'out', 'laborious', 'detail', 'elaborate', 'story', 'clues', 'Yet', 'as', 'much', 'fault', 'nature', 'design', 'novel', 'man', 'given', 'unenviable', 'task', 'bringing', 'screen', 'Moreover', 'perhaps', 'interest', 'time', 'keeping', 'action', 'flowing', 'Robert', 'Sophie', 'come', 'up', 'solutions', 'myriad', 'much', 'too', 'quickly', 'accurately', 'Golly', 'gee', 'could', 'mean_______', 'attitude', 'borders', 'ludicrous', 'somehow', 'Howard', 'most', 'work', 'Perhaps', 'clunky', 'literal-minded', 'earnestness', 'subject', 'ultimately', 'buy', 'better', 'judgment.Tom', 'Hanks', 'stolid', 'passive', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'college', 'professor', 'involuntarily', 'driven', 'cloak-and-dagger', 'intrigue', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'certain', 'subtle', 'charm', 'Sophie', 'woman', 'who', 'may', 'play', 'more', 'part', 'unraveling', 'mystery', 'even', 'can', 'imagine', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'have', 'moments', 'two', 'less', 'savory', 'players', 'story', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Sir', 'Leigh', 'Teabing', 'expert', 'things', 'related', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'who', 'walks', 'off', 'film', 'scenery-chewing', 'shtick', 'pumps', 'much', 'needed', 'life', 'tale', 'essentially', 'populated', 'underdeveloped', 'stick', 'figures.The', 'religious', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'novel', 'film', 'as', 'ludicrous', 'unjustified', 'Anyone', 'belief', 'system', 'could', 'be', 'seriously', 'shaken', 'absurd', 'mixture', 'unsubstantiated', 'myth-making', 'plain', 'old-fashioned', 'wild', 'speculation', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'very', 'solid', 'foundation', 'faith', 'begin', 'with.The', 'rest', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'what', 'overblown', 'epic', 'exercise', 'code-busting', 'clue-decoding', 'short', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'whodunits']",N/A
639962,A1NDYXBX0IAUAY,B00005JOC9,Ronald L. Russell,"[14, 16]","The film adaptation of Dan Brown's book, ""The Da Vinci Code"" can be viewed as a test to determine how receptive the readers mind is to new ideas. Be warned, some of the ideas presented in this story can be very uncomfortable for some people, depending on their religious convictions and on their receptivity. However, the material contained in his book is relevant on several levels.First, the plot deals with a theme which is near the hearts of hundreds of millions of potential viewers, namely the history of the Christian Church. The story challenges readers with new information which may not agree with what they think they already know.Second, the story is exquisitely well researched, drawing from documents as old as the 1st century, through medievel Holy Grail legends, through Renaissance paintings, and ties them together into what the British used to call ""a ripping yarn"".Third, although most of the characters in the story are fictional, many of the concepts presented in the story are historically true. It is perhaps this last point which has created the greatest amount of controversy.The movie (and the book upon which it is based) develops the idea that before Christianity, many religions embraced a balanced worldview in which the sacred feminine principle and the sacred masculine principle joined to maintain harmony. That this was once the case is evident from the mythology of many cultures, with their pantheons of gods and goddesses. However, Brown writes that Jesus embraced these ideas as well, a notion which would have been radical to patriarchal Jews of that time, and would certainly have stepped on the toes of the Jewish clergy.Brown does a good job of supporting this idea, and echoes what is documented in many other historical non-fiction works, such as ""The Chalice And The Blade"" by Riane Eisler.Perhaps the most difficult aspect of the story for some readers to accept is that in addition to his revolutionary teachings, Jesus lived as did other Jewish men in his culture, and took a wife, Mary Magdelene, and had children with her, descendants of whom survive in the present day. Documents written in the first century comment on Jesus relationship with Mary, however these were eventually suppressed several hundred years later following the Nicean council. Interestingly, the four canonical gospels do not specifically deny that Jesus married, and are completely silent regarding his life between age 12 and age 30. Any given reader will accept or reject this premise of a married Jesus depending primarily on what they choose to accept as evidence.Whether a reader believes that Jesus married or not, the premise does make a great ""what if"" foundation on which to construct a thrilling story, in a manner similar to ""what if"" the Ark of the Covenant were still in existence, and an archeologist found it? (i.e. Raiders of the Lost Ark). One does not need to actually believe that the Ark still exists, or even that it ever existed, in order to be entertained. Such is the case with ""The Da Vinci Code"".As was the case with films such as ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", many (although certainly not all) Christians do not like to hear that what they already believe may not be completely accurate.For some people, anything which might require a readjustment in thinking is automatically branded a falsehood. These are the people who picket movie theatres protesting films which they have never seen, or who write reviews slamming books which they have never read.In an ironic manner, these people become part of a  policy of suppression which attempts to block access to alternative information which presents a different view. As one who prefers to weigh both sides of issues and decide for myself what makes more sense, all the protests and denials made me want to read the book, and see to the film, even more.Although difficult for some to admit, the reality is that sometimes new information becomes available which renders previous understandings obsolete. For example, we now know that diseases are caused by germs and virus, and not by an imbalance in four humours as was once believed. We also now know that Earth is spherical, and orbits the Sun, instead of being flat and located at the center of the Universe, as was once widely believed by Christians (the ancient pagans knew better, as proven by their surviving writings). Some of the information in this book will be new information to some people, others already were aware of the historical elements which form the basis for this story.I found the book to be sufficiently well written and interesting that I read it through in parts of three days. Nothing I read offended me, I read with an open mind and tended to think ""Well, it COULD have happened that way"".When I read the book, I had not yet seen the movie, but was aware that Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellan and Alfred Molina were cast in leading roles, so I tended to see them in their roles as I read.When I actually saw the movie, I found that the story moved quite quickly, and kept me enraptured with beautiful imagery and stirring music. At times, the director caused a flashback to overlap the action on screen, so that you could see the character, and what they were remembering, at the same time. This was used in several of the scenes where Langdon was rearranging letters or images in his mind while attempting to solve a clue. At other times a similar technique was used to show modern action and action hundreds of years previously which occurred at the same location, on the screen at the same time. All of the characters were played with genuine depth, having complex, well developed personalities. Tom Hanks was very good as Robert Langdon, the expert symbologist. I especially appreciated the manner in which Audrey Tautou played Sophie Neveu, the cryptographer. In this role, she simply radiated a pure feminine quality, which, as the story developed, proved that she was the perfect choice for the role.Sir Ian McKellan was also very good as Sir Leigh Teabing, a wealthy enthusiast in all things related to the search for Holy Grail.Many of the twists and turns in the story came as complete surprises to me. Some of the people I was sure were sinister were actually motivated by noble intentions, and some of the people I thought were good guys turned out to be ruthless.I strongly recommend this movie, and the book upon which it is based. For the maximum enjoyment, see the movie first, then go back and read the book for additional details.I eagerly look forward to the movies release on DVD.",5,An exciting adventure for viewers with

639964,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JOC9,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 7]","Tom Hanks is Robert Langdon, the walking bibliophile of ancient codes and symbols, who is implicated in the murder of one of the Louvre's curators, a man who himself is something of a mystery.  Brought to the scene of the crime without being told that he's a suspect, Langdon is shocked to find the body positioned according to Da Vinci's ""Vitruvian Man"", and more shocked to learn that the victim assumed this position himself before dying - a sort of final coded message between two men with a love for codes.  Warned of the suspicions surrounding him by Sophie Neveau (Audrey Tatou), the dead man's granddaughter, Langdon escapes and leads the police in a chase across France in a desperate gamble to learn the victim's last, greatest secret.  Soon, Langdon's pursuers come to include a homicidal monk dispatched by a Bishop of the reactionary order of Opus Dei, and all events are shown to have been manipulated by a mysterious character known as ""Teacher"".  As Langdon picks up clues, he begins to realize that the mystery may involve the legend of the ""Holy Grail"", and heads for the home of an old friend, Sir Lee Teabing, the foremost proponent of a particularly unique theory of Grail legend.Even giving the movie the same allowances as the book, DVC is a horrible movie, slow, pedantic and full of red herrings that no sane moviegoer will fall for.  The religious controversy surrounding DVC thinly masks the movie's two cardinal flaws - 1) that it takes itself way more seriously than it deserves (the world is full of distinct religions espousing wholly incompatible beliefs - are we to believe that an admittedly dramatic discovery on one of them will really change the rest of the world?  Also, assuming the secret was uncovered, DVC never clears up how it would be proven); 2) it's boring!  At over two hours (and boy, will you feel it!) the only secret uncovered is that it's possible to have both Ian McKellan and Tom Hanks in a movie lacking almost any energy.  Hanks is serviceable as Langdon, Dan Brown's factotum of symbols nobody really cares about.  KcKellen chews up the scenery as Teabing, but ultimately the pointlessness of his character overwhelms McKellen's presence - whether you buy into his theories or not depends largely on the same degree of faith as the religion that Teabing assails.  The flick telegraphs its thrills - my wife and I were able to guess what would happen next, who would say what, etc...  The novel excelled because skillful pacing kept the action from being overwhelmed by the hot air of its long theories.The film plays down the novel's attacks on the Church for a more sustained atmosphere of religious antipathy (from disfavored apostles to Isaac Newton, if you've got a mind of your own, the Church hates and fears you, a bit of low-grade demagoguery that the script takes for granted).  To add insult to injury, DVC treats the Church as irrelevant (despite their wealth and power, the clergy in DVC are relegated to being unwitting pawns of a higher, if more temporal power).  But as I said, the story's attack on religion is itself a smokescreen hiding the fact that DVC is simply inert.",2,The biggest secret of all: a cure for insomnia.,1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,3147,"['Tom', 'Hanks', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'walking', 'bibliophile', 'ancient', 'codes', 'symbols', 'who', 'implicated', 'murder', 'one', 'Louvre', 'curators', 'man', 'who', 'something', 'mystery', 'Brought', 'scene', 'crime', 'being', 'told', 'suspect', 'Langdon', 'shocked', 'find', 'body', 'positioned', 'according', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Vitruvian', 'Man', 'more', 'shocked', 'learn', 'victim', 'assumed', 'position', 'dying', 'sort', 'final', 'coded', 'message', 'two', 'men', 'love', 'codes', 'Warned', 'suspicions', 'surrounding', 'Sophie', 'Neveau', 'Audrey', 'Tatou', 'dead', 'man', 'granddaughter', 'Langdon', 'police', 'chase', 'across', 'France', 'desperate', 'gamble', 'learn', 'victim', 'last', 'greatest', 'secret', 'Soon', 'Langdon', 'pursuers', 'come', 'include', 'homicidal', 'monk', 'dispatched', 'Bishop', 'reactionary', 'order', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'events', 'are', 'shown', 'have', 'been', 'manipulated', 'mysterious', 'character', 'known', 'Teacher', 'Langdon', 'up', 'clues', 'realize', 'mystery', 'may', 'involve', 'legend', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'heads', 'home', 'old', 'friend', 'Sir', 'Lee', 'Teabing', 'foremost', 'proponent', 'particularly', 'unique', 'theory', 'Grail', 'legend.Even', 'giving', 'movie', 'same', 'allowances', 'book', 'DVC', 'horrible', 'movie', 'slow', 'pedantic', 'full', 'red', 'herrings', 'sane', 'moviegoer', 'will', 'fall', 'religious', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'DVC', 'thinly', 'movie', 'two', 'cardinal', 'flaws', '1', 'way', 'more', 'seriously', 'world', 'full', 'distinct', 'religions', 'espousing', 'wholly', 'incompatible', 'beliefs', 'are', 'believe', 'admittedly', 'dramatic', 'discovery', 'one', 'will', 'really', 'change', 'rest', 'world', 'Also', 'assuming', 'secret', 'was', 'uncovered', 'DVC', 'never', 'up', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'proven', '2', 'boring', 'two', 'hours', 'boy', 'will', 'feel', 'only', 'secret', 'uncovered', 'possible', 'have', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'movie', 'lacking', 'almost', 'energy', 'Hanks', 'serviceable', 'Langdon', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'factotum', 'symbols', 'nobody', 'really', 'KcKellen', 'up', 'scenery', 'Teabing', 'ultimately', 'pointlessness', 'character', 'overwhelms', 'McKellen', 'presence', 'buy', 'theories', 'not', 'largely', 'same', 'degree', 'faith', 'religion', 'Teabing', 'assails', 'flick', 'telegraphs', 'thrills', 'wife', 'were', 'able', 'guess', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'who', 'would', 'say', 'what', 'etc', 'novel', 'excelled', 'because', 'skillful', 'pacing', 'kept', 'action', 'being', 'overwhelmed', 'hot', 'air', 'long', 'theories.The', 'film', 'down', 'novel', 'attacks', 'Church', 'more', 'sustained', 'atmosphere', 'religious', 'antipathy', 'disfavored', 'apostles', 'Isaac', 'Newton', ""'ve"", 'got', 'mind', 'own', 'Church', 'hates', 'fears', 'bit', 'low-grade', 'demagoguery', 'script', 'granted', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'DVC', 'Church', 'irrelevant', 'wealth', 'power', 'clergy', 'DVC', 'are', 'relegated', 'being', 'unwitting', 'pawns', 'higher', 'more', 'temporal', 'power', 'said', 'story', 'attack', 'religion', 'smokescreen', 'hiding', 'fact', 'DVC', 'simply', 'inert']",N/A

639966,A1DL0EDVWPSPEW,B00005JOC9,"Ryan Matthews ""montvil""","[1, 2]","It would almost be wiser to watch the movie before you read the book. The advice seems backwards, I know, but reading Dan Brown's gripping novel first causes viewers of the movie to be much more critical, naturally. Though this is the case with many books turned Hollywood features, The Da Vinci Code is not a bad adaptation of the original masterpiece. It just had far too much to live up to.First of all, 2 hours and 20 minutes, the approximate run-time of The Da Vinci Code, is not nearly big enough a window to fit a story Brown told so thoroughly. I understand the need to trim the fat in some places, and I understand that very few people are lured to the movies for a 3 hour affair, but for a tale of such epic proportions that generated such controversy, an exception had to be made. The movie took on a lethal pace, giving the actors no time to really place emphasis on the quest at hand, and giving the viewers no time to really absorb the historical twist that is being proposed. For a Holy Grail quest, the action vastly outweighed the drama, an aspect that caused the plot to suffer. Frankly, it's not a popcorn movie, nor a date movie. Most of the viewers I'd assume were readers first. It was made too much to be a Hollywood blockbuster; it's almost like the makers were tiptoeing through the script to be sure they didn't ruffle too many feathers. Well that's just impossible when religion is under the microscope. I know big budget films command big budget dollars, but you can't be so careful with a seemingly instant classic work of literature. I would've been happy to give this movie 2 hrs, 50 minutes of my time if it had gone more in depth, if it had been more daring in its capacity. The way Dan Brown told it, if you hadn't heard the whispers before, you were almost out of breath reading his dramatic alterations to history. I was never moved in the same way by the film.The script was written in a very matter-of-fact manner. That is to say, especially in Audrey Tautou's (Sophie Neveu) case, there were no moments of absolute astonishment made for these characters. Outside Sophie's final revelation in Scotland, utter disbelief of the events transpiring always seemed to escape her. I thought the actors were given very little to work with in terms of their emotional connection to the story, and that is the purpose for my subject title. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou were an excellent pair, their chemistry visibly growing both as actors and as characters throughout. However, Brown really spends a lot of time developing a relationship between the two and I thought the film could've spent a little more time combing out the details of why they were teamed up and how they grew closer as they learned more about each other. Ian McKellen was a fantastic choice for Sir Leigh Teabing. But again, this man was portrayed by Brown as someone who moved to France because finding the Grail was his life's work. He was a man of great enthusiasm for the quest, giddy even, as some would say the author made it seem. The movie not only didn't discuss in depth how Langdon knew Teabing, but it made Teabing seem like nothing more than a devoted history buff.For a story named The Da Vinci Code, the presence of Leonardo Da Vinci in this film was scarce, at best. Jacques Sauniere was supposedly a man so passionate about former Grand Master and multi-talented Leonardo Da Vinci, yet very little of the Da Vinci story came to surface in the movie. I felt like a history student reading the book, and though highly inaccurate in parts, Brown made it a very informative read. I was disappointed that the movie chose not to dive into great detail of the anagrams, the paintings, the knight on Sauniere's desk, even the Vitruvian Man. The Louvre scenes felt rushed, and it was really the groundwork the rest of the movie was built on. They should've been laid out with more care. Unfortunately, I wouldn't be surprised if many people who only saw the movie got lost very quickly.I thought a couple flashbacks to Langdon's classes at Harvard would've sufficed for a history lesson of Da Vinci's work and his connection to the story at hand. Apparently, my ideas were not as popular with the writers.Lastly, why did we have to eliminate the first cryptex? Is someone to tell me that ten more minutes could not have been spent on the cryptex this movie chose to completely ignore? Maybe it's just me, but I thought the missing cryptex in the film was one of the more clever things Dan Brown dreamed up for the novel. It's the last in a long line of glaring exclusions for big fans of The Da Vinci Code.Flawed, yes. A total failure? Absolutely not. As previously mentioned, I thought the casting was brilliant; a stellar performance brought forth by all parties considering the mediocre writing and direction. A couple other high points:- Though altered from the book, the scene in the Rosslyn Chapel was exceptional.- Sophie's creative driving in the chase scene from the American Embassy.- I loved the set for the Swiss Bank. It made for a riveting scene.All in all, it's hard to completely ruin a great story, so I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code for just that; the story itself. For each character, it served a different purpose; to clear one's name of criminal acts, to unveil the truth about one's family, to chase one's lifelong dream. To strip the power a brotherhood has held for centuries. I would've given it 3 1/2 stars, but with the underrated performances of Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou and Jean Reno, who played Bezu Fache, I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Expectations are dangerous to go into a movie with. Leave them behind and you should enjoy this film.Grade: B+",4,Cast Saves a Less Than Moving Script,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,5686,"['would', 'almost', 'be', 'wiser', 'watch', 'movie', 'read',

639968,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JOC9,Samuel McKewon,"[4, 7]","It's a fish, folks. A stiff, cold one wrapped in last Sunday's ads. ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a buttoned-up bore, a prestige picture so prude most scenes could have staged at the community playhouse. Director Ron Howard, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and every single actor colors completely inside the lines of Dan Brown's novel. The book works because the camera is our imagination. The movie captures little of th aura, momentum or controversy found in Brown's pages.Challenging the divinity of Jesus Christ by claiming he married Mary Magdalene and fathered children, ""The Da Vinci Code"" was an effective piece of historical fantasy because it compressed its story into 24 hours, played fast with the truth (such as relying on Gospels written 200 years after the death of Jesus) used intriguing locales (The Lourve, Westminster Abbey) and dared to villanize a real Catholic organization (Opus Dei) as mastermind of a conspiracy to suppress, as several characters call it, ""the sacred feminine."" The secret is revealed when a hooded albino monk (Paul Bettany) shoots the curator of Louvre -who has time before dying to tip off Harvard professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and cryptologist grannddaughter Sophie(Audrey Tautou) that his murder is more meaningful than it seems. Chief inspector Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) has reason to suspect Langdon is the killer. Sophie, working off her own clues, knows better.The movie then shifts into a lengthy scavenger hunt for, yes, The Holy Grail, protected by the Priory of Sion, a ancient religious sect that included Da Vinci and Sir Issac Newton among its members. The Grail is not a cup, but Jesus' bloodline, as Langdon and Sophie discover from British grail historian Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen). It's Teabing, hobbling about on canes in his cavernous mansion, who lays out the movie's conspiracy theories in a 20-minute lecture that includes flashbacks and microwave history. It deserves a small refutation.To quote Hanks, the material peddled  here is ""hooey,"" but, taken sincerely, it begs a serious question - if Jesus was married, and thus not the son of God, does it matter whether he has a bloodline? Goldsman and Howard make some effort to inject a certain character with healing abilities that suggest Jesus' miraculous powers, and in fact the movie needs Jesus to be just who the four Gospels found in the Bible say he is - a prophet, a martyr, sinless. But the Jesus presented in those Gospels is not married, except to his ""bride"" in Revelation: The church of his believers. Though Brown's book more clearly wants readers to consider the Gnostic position (that Jesus was not, as the Gospel of John claims, the word become flesh, but the word *and* the flesh) the movie cannot argue that without taking yet another ten minutes to jabber. In other words, it's no ""JFK"" in presenting its alternate reality.Which is permissable, cinematically, if ""The Da Vinci Code"" pulsed with hot blood. But Howard buries his actors beneath the screenplay. The ghostly, grainy flashbacks seem borrowed from the History Channel or Unsolved Mysteries. The photography, courtesy Salvatore Totino, is serviceable but phony - the shadows are manufactured, the exotic locales touristy. Again and again, Howard relies on reaction shots, needless closeups, and a domesticity born out of, yes, the nature of the screenplay, but also Howard's recent habit, since beginning work with Totino, to put scenes inside a concentrated, austere box of drama, as he intends an actor to say in every scene, ""I need to believe a miracle can happen."" Howard is of the right demeanor for ""The Da Vinci Code"" - his movies aren't exactly faint, and some of his better efforts (the first half of ""Ransom,"" ""The Missing"") almost seem to slide a solemn tint on their camera lenses - so it's fair to assume he divined a path to daylight and a $500 million worldwide box office and directed the squarest picture he could imagine. Its dull polish isn't even completely tangible; it's simply immediate and pitiable.Hanks acts he showed up and took orders as Robert Langdon. He walks, runs, squints - his lips even move. Truthfully, Hanks lacks the arrogance to invest in half-baked academic wit, and that rare talent to make the inane - ""I have to get to a library, fast""  - sound urgent. His co-star, Tautou, has the presence and beauty, along with the most infectious grin in movies.  A shame she gets to use it only once, in the movie's only clever joke. McKellen is starting to slip into Anthony Hopkins country. And the less said about Bettany's bizarre monk - his Latin brogue and welt-ridden body - the better.",2,In your summer stocking...a lump of coal.,1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,4622,"['fish', 'folks', 'stiff', 'cold', 'one', 'wrapped', 'last', 'Sunday', 'ads', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'buttoned-up', 'bore', 'prestige', 'picture', 'so', 'prude', 'most', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'staged', 'community', 'playhouse', 'Director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'screenwriter', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'single', 'actor', 'colors', 'completely', 'lines', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'novel', 'book', 'camera', 'imagination', 'movie', 'little', 'th', 'aura', 'momentum', 'controversy', 'found', 'Brown', 'pages.Challenging', 'divinity', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'claiming', 'married', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'fathered', 'children', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'was', 'effective', 'piece', 'historical', 'fantasy', 'compressed', 'story', '24', 'hours', 'played', 'fast', 'truth', 'such', 'relying', 'Gospels', 'written', '200', 'years', 'death', 'Jesus', 'used', 'intriguing', 'locales', 'Lourve', 'Westminster', 'Abbey', 'dared', 'villanize', 'real', 'Catholic', 'organization', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'mastermind', 'conspiracy', 'suppress', 'several', 'characters', 'call', 'sacred', 'feminine', 'secret', 'revealed', 'when', 'hooded', 'albino', 'monk', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'shoots', 'curator', 'Louvre', '-who', 'time', 'dying', 'tip', 'off', 'Harvard', 'professor', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'cryptologist', 'grannddaughter', 'Sophie', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'murder', 'more', 'meaningful', 'Chief', 'inspector', 'Bezu', 'Fache', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'reason', 'suspect', 'Langdon', 'killer', 'Sophie', 'working', 'off', 'own', 'clues', 'better.The', 'movie', 'then', 'lengthy', 'scavenger', 'hunt', 'yes', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'protected', 'Priory', 'Sion', 'ancient', 'religious', 'sect', 'included', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Sir', 'Issac', 'Newton', 'members', 'Grail', 'not', 'cup', 'Jesus', 'bloodline', 'Langdon', 'Sophie', 'discover', 'British', 'grail', 'historian', 'Leigh', 'Teabing', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Teabing', 'hobbling', 'canes', 'cavernous', 'mansion', 'who', 'out', 'movie', 'conspiracy', 'theories', '20-minute', 'lecture', 'flashbacks', 'microwave', 'history', 'small', 'refutation.To', 'quote', 'Hanks', 'material', 'peddled', 'here', 'hooey', 'taken', 'sincerely', 'serious', 'question', 'Jesus', 'was', 'married', 'thus', 'not', 'son', 'God', 'matter', 'bloodline', 'Goldsman', 'Howard', 'make', 'effort', 'inject', 'certain', 'character', 'healing', 'abilities', 'suggest', 'Jesus', 'miraculous', 'powers', 'fact', 'movie', 'Jesus', 'be', 'just', 'who', 'four', 'Gospels', 'found', 'Bible', 'say', 'prophet', 'martyr', 'sinless', 'Jesus', 'presented', 'Gospels', 'not', 'married', 'bride', 'Revelation', 'church', 'believers', 'Brown', 'book', 'more', 'clearly', 'readers', 'consider', 'Gnostic', 'position', 'Jesus', 'was', 'not', 'Gospel', 'John', 'claims', 'word', 'become', 'flesh', 'word', 'flesh', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'argue', 'taking', 'yet', 'ten', 'minutes', 'jabber', 'other', 'words', 'JFK', 'presenting', 'alternate', 'reality.Which', 'permissable', 'cinematically', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'pulsed', 'hot', 'blood', 'Howard', 'actors', 'beneath', 'screenplay', 'ghostly', 'grainy', 'flashbacks', 'seem', 'borrowed', 'History', 'Channel', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', 'photography', 'courtesy', 'Salvatore', 'Totino', 'serviceable', 'phony', 'shadows', 'are', 'manufactured', 'exotic', 'locales', 'touristy', 'Again', 'again', 'Howard', 'reaction', 'shots', 'needless', 'closeups', 'domesticity', 'born', 'yes', 'nature', 'screenplay', 'also', 'Howard', 'recent', 'habit', 'beginning', 'work', 'Totino', 'put', 'scenes', 'concentrated', 'austere', 'box', 'drama', 'actor', 'say', 'scene', 'need', 'believe', 'miracle', 'can', 'happen', 'Howard', 'right', 'demeanor', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'faint', 'better', 'efforts', 'first', 'half', 'Ransom', 'Missing', 'almost', 'seem', 'slide', 'solemn', 'tint', 'camera', 'fair', 'assume', 'divined', 'path', 'daylight', '500', 'million', 'worldwide', 'box', 'office', 'directed', 'squarest', 'picture', 'could', 'imagine', 'dull', 'polish', ""n't"", 'even', 'completely', 'tangible', 'simply', 'immediate', 'pitiable.Hanks', 'acts', 'showed', 'up', 'took', 'orders', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'runs', 'squints', 'lips', 'even', 'move', 'Truthfully', 'Hanks', 'arrogance', 'invest', 'half-baked', 'academic', 'wit', 'rare', 'talent', 'make', 'inane', 'have', 'get', 'library', 'fast', 'sound', 'urgent', 'co-star', 'Tautou', 'presence', 'beauty', 'most', 'infectious', 'grin', 'movies', 'shame', 'use', 'only', 'once', 'movie', 'only', 'clever', 'joke', 'McKellen', 'starting', 'slip', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'country', 'less', 'said', 'Bettany', 'bizarre', 'monk', 'Latin', 'brogue', 'welt-ridden', 'body', 'better']",N/A

First of all, the movie is more spectacular on the big screen. But what else would you expect? The reason I like this movie so much and why I believe it is so popular with the public: I grew up going to church and seeing firsthand the dirty politics played behind the scenes. This movie, though fictitious, still holds a grain of potential truth that there is a church coverup of the realities behind one of the most prevalent religions in the world today. The real coverup though is not as concealed as the movie portrays. Knowledge is readily available for those who are willing to research the history of christianity. As any bible scholar will tell you, there is no certainty of who the authors of the bible were and in fact even which books of the bible were written first. Although the movie does not go into this theorizing, it brings a lot of questions to mind regarding the church and specifically christianity, which is why the churches worldwide wanted this movie banned so badly, i.e. Knowledge has always been a threat to the church establishment.Disc One, the movie: I did not read more than a few chapters of The Da Vinci Code book before seeing the movie; however, it amazed me that the movie portrayed scenes exactly (and I mean EXACTLY) as I had pictured them in my mind while reading the book. The scenes and dialog that Ron Howard (Director) left out were of little consequence in my opinion. I must admit, I found myself teary-eyed throughout the viewing, and this is the fifth time I've seen it! That shows the depth of feeling this picture contains!!Disc Two, the extras: I won't ruin the surprise for you, but the part about the body of Sauniere may shock you. I know I'll be watching the movie again just to see those scenes, if for no other reason! Also, I must admit my knowledge of master works of art is limited, but I did see glimpses of symbolism that I wondered about (and which was not pointed out) in the movie itself. I am glad to learn that these were ""codes"" deliberately inserted into the movie for those alert to noticing them. I will definitely be watching this film again. It is remarkable, intelligent, and liberating all at the same time and provides for varying viewpoints and discussions that are long overdue.",5,Beautiful!!!,1164240000,"11 23, 2006",2006,2368,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'fifth', 'time', 'saw', 'four', 'times', 'theatre', 'once', 'DVD', 'First', 'all', 'movie', 'more', 'spectacular', 'big', 'screen', 'what', 'else', 'would', 'expect', 'reason', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'why', 'believe', 'so', 'popular', 'public', 'grew', 'up', 'going', 'church', 'seeing', 'firsthand', 'dirty', 'politics', 'played', 'scenes', 'movie', 'though', 'fictitious', 'still', 'grain', 'potential', 'truth', 'church', 'coverup', 'realities', 'one', 'most', 'prevalent', 'religions', 'world', 'today', 'real', 'coverup', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'concealed', 'movie', 'Knowledge', 'readily', 'available', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'research', 'history', 'christianity', 'bible', 'scholar', 'will', 'tell', 'certainty', 'who', 'authors', 'bible', 'were', 'fact', 'even', 'books', 'bible', 'were', 'written', 'first', 'movie', 'not', 'go', 'theorizing', 'lot', 'questions', 'mind', 'regarding', 'church', 'specifically', 'christianity', 'why', 'churches', 'worldwide', 'wanted', 'movie', 'banned', 'so', 'badly', 'i.e', 'Knowledge', 'always', 'been', 'threat', 'church', 'One', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'more', 'few', 'chapters', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'book', 'seeing', 'movie', 'however', 'amazed', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'scenes', 'exactly', 'mean', 'EXACTLY', 'had', 'pictured', 'mind', 'reading', 'book', 'scenes', 'dialog', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Director', 'left', 'out', 'were', 'little', 'consequence', 'opinion', 'must', 'admit', 'found', 'teary-eyed', 'viewing', 'fifth', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'depth', 'feeling', 'picture', 'Disc', 'Two', 'extras', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'surprise', 'part', 'body', 'Sauniere', 'may', 'shock', 'know', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'movie', 'again', 'just', 'see', 'scenes', 'other', 'reason', 'Also', 'must', 'admit', 'knowledge', 'master', 'works', 'art', 'limited', 'did', 'see', 'glimpses', 'symbolism', 'wondered', 'was', 'not', 'pointed', 'out', 'movie', 'am', 'glad', 'learn', 'were', 'codes', 'deliberately', 'inserted', 'movie', 'alert', 'noticing', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'watching', 'film', 'again', 'remarkable', 'intelligent', 'liberating', 'same', 'time', 'varying', 'viewpoints', 'discussions', 'are', 'long', 'overdue']",N/A

And it did not take long for this to happen, with an end result that is both satisfactory by itself and faithful to the story presented in the book. It even improves on the weak aspect that I found when I read the novel, the ending. Although it does not change the resolution, the movie enhances the transition to the ending, making it much better than the rushed set of event we got in Brown's novel.Setting aside the deficiencies related to the conclusion of the story, Brown created a great work of fiction. One that is based on historical research and an explanation of the events that provides and alternate scenario to the one presented by the Catholic Church. But the main strength is that the story delivers this explanation in an entertaining way, weaved into a thriller that includes the murder of the curator of the Louvre, solving a myriad of puzzles and enigmas, and a complex set of conspiracies to hide the truth about the origins of Christianity.Brown did not pull any punches when creating his novel and the movie leaves these intact and in place. Therefore, we witness a sharp criticism of the Opus Dei, a right wing sect of the church, showing these fanatics in a decidedly unfavorable light. Silas, the murderer of the curator, is an ascetic member of this order and is willing to get involved in extremely unchristian-like behavior in order to achieve his goals, and those of the leaders of the sect.The movie also counts with an all-star cast, and even though I do not think that Tom Hanks was the greatest choice to portray Robert Langdon, due to his physical characteristics, all of them do an outstanding job. I was particularly impressed by Ian McKellen, who plays Sir Leigh Teabing, a Holy Grail scholar that has an amazing drive and passion for his life's work. Besides the acting, I think that the music used was an excellent choice, since it blends extremely well with the plot and provides uplifting moments when needed.This is not the first time that a work of fiction challenges the events narrated by the Bible. For an example, you can check out the impressiveThe Gospel According to Jesus Christby Jose Saramago. However, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is successful in presenting this alternate theory in a manner in which it is easier to digest, mainly due to its super-fast pace. I recommend this movie to everyone, since you do not have to believe that the alternate version of the facts is true to enjoy the story.",4,"""Witness the greatest cover-up in human history""",1191110400,"09 30, 2007",2007,2576,"['Most', 'people', 'read', 'novel', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'probably', 'realized', 'time', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'use', 'making', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'happen', 'end', 'result', 'satisfactory', 'faithful', 'story', 'presented', 'book', 'even', 'weak', 'aspect', 'found', 'when', 'read', 'novel', 'ending', 'not', 'change', 'resolution', 'movie', 'transition', 'ending', 'making', 'much', 'better', 'rushed', 'set', 'event', 'got', 'Brown', 'novel.Setting', 'deficiencies', 'related', 'conclusion', 'story', 'Brown', 'created', 'great', 'work', 'fiction', 'One', 'based', 'historical', 'research', 'explanation', 'events', 'alternate', 'scenario', 'one', 'presented', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'main', 'strength', 'story', 'explanation', 'entertaining', 'way', 'weaved', 'thriller', 'murder', 'curator', 'Louvre', 'solving', 'myriad', 'puzzles', 'enigmas', 'complex', 'set', 'conspiracies', 'hide', 'truth', 'origins', 'Christianity.Brown', 'did', 'not', 'pull', 'punches', 'when', 'creating', 'novel', 'movie', 'intact', 'place', 'Therefore', 'witness', 'sharp', 'criticism', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'right', 'wing', 'sect', 'church', 'showing', 'fanatics', 'decidedly', 'unfavorable', 'light', 'Silas', 'murderer', 'curator', 'ascetic', 'member', 'order', 'willing', 'get', 'involved', 'extremely', 'unchristian-like', 'behavior', 'order', 'achieve', 'goals', 'leaders', 'sect.The', 'movie', 'also', 'all-star', 'cast', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'was', 'greatest', 'choice', 'portray', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'due', 'physical', 'characteristics', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'who', 'Sir', 'Leigh', 'Teabing', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'scholar', 'amazing', 'drive', 'passion', 'life', 'work', 'acting', 'think', 'music', 'used', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'extremely', 'well', 'plot', 'uplifting', 'moments', 'when', 'needed.This', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'work', 'fiction', 'events', 'narrated', 'Bible', 'example', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'impressiveThe', 'Gospel', 'According', 'Jesus', 'Christby', 'Jose', 'Saramago', 'However', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'successful', 'presenting', 'alternate', 'theory', 'manner', 'easier', 'digest', 'mainly', 'due', 'super-fast', 'pace', 'recommend', 'movie', 'everyone', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'believe', 'alternate', 'version', 'facts', 'true', 'enjoy', 'story']",N/A

Yarbrough""","[3, 7]","This movie is the secret excuse for Bible-thumping Christians to finally find out what The Code is all about, after probably boycotting Dan Brown's book because it might make baby Jesus mad at you.  You'll watch your television, but can't pick up the book and read it for yourself because it might sit your fingers on fire.  It's true that there is a fine line between real life and fiction.  And just because Dan Brown took a thought that's been around for years and used it for the premise of a mystery thriller, the whole church gets in an uproar.  Finally, all the homosexual priests get a break!The movie is a good Hollywood version of the book.  I could go on and on about how good the book is, but I guess I should just review it instead.  So about the movie....Ron Howard did a great job of bringing the book to the screen.  In typical book-to-movie fashion, it isn't all there.  As other reviewers have stated, there are just parts that wouldn't gel to the screen so creative licensing was taken into effect.  But that's okay, it doesn't steal away from the overall excitement of the movie.  I'd still read the book if I were you, but you could walk away from the movie extremely satisfied and feel like you know what all the Dan Brown gossip is about.The Da Vinci Code is a fun film because so many people doomed it from the very beginning just because of the controversy stirred up by the book itself.  Just keep telling yourself it's fiction!  Yes, it makes you think.  Yes, it questions faith and ideas.  But wasn't Christianity founded on that very premise?  Questioning what you believe!  This film shouldn't change your overall religious beliefs, if anything I hope it would make you peel back those blinders and take a look at the rest of the world around you.  You might learn something.  And if anything, maybe it turned more people onto Da Vinci and his art, any art for that matter.I love Tom Hanks, but I too rolled my eyes when I learned he was to be the lead in the film.  I wanted that lead guy from Jurassic Park to play the part, but Hanks didn't disappoint.  We all know he was just there to guarantee $$$ at the box office.  And he did a good job, I must say.So, if you enjoy a good mystery or action packed thriller, then treat yourself to The Code.

639983,A1FCWRSICTO2AH,B00005JOC9,S. Harris,"[4, 6]","For about the first hour (!) or so, I felt the Da Vinci code was a bit of a slog.  That said, overall it really isn't a bad movie.  Ron Howard, who is kind of a poor man's Spielberg, had the good sense to populate his movie with A-list actors.  This is a good thing, because every ten minutes or so there is some explanation for a mystery or puzzle, that is usually best left on the page rather than in a movie.  And Da Vinci Code has those in dizzying numbers.  The result is that Hanks (bad hair!) as super symbol-guy Robert Langdon, and Audrey Tautou (good hair!) as cryptologist Sophie Nevue are pretty much reduced to (as they catch their breath) constantly delivering where-are-we-now speeches in their hunt for the ""truth.""  As much as this cuts against both of these actors real strengths as actors, it oddly doesn't sink the film.  The X factor is Ian McKellan as Grail expert Sir Leigh Teabing, McKellan who clearly has puckish fun with the role.  And it is about at this point in the movie that the cumulative effect of all this alternative history regarding Jesus and Mary Magdalene, their protectors and attackers, begins to take hold.What can I say?  That sure looks like a woman in that painting by Da Vinci.  I know I've looked at the painting umpteen times, but it's true that the body language, posture, face, sure look feminine, and seems in sharp contrast with the male figures in the painting.  I don't know about all that other mumbo-jumbo regarding ""V"" in the painting - the female principle and God, but as a movie it works in a fun way, getting you thinking.  The chase aspect of this story however is clunky, and if anything makes the movie seem longer than it should be.  Character motivations are tissue-thin, and characters in general are cardboard ones, propped up a bit, as I said earlier, by very good actors.  However, the payoff at the end of the film is worth it.  And I have to admit, I was moved.  If nothing else was accomplished by this movie, the clearing of Mary Magdalene's name has at least been partly accomplished - at least more so than any vague Vatican statement regarding her not being a prostitute.

Their signs say things like ""this movie is blasphemous"" and ""don't see this movie, it is sacrilegious"". I think these groups of people soon forget that more people have died in the name of religion than all of the wars in history put together. To add to that same note, the Catholics think their religion is so perfect, yet they seem to forget the hundreds and thousands of innocent women who were tortured and killed in the 14th century because they were deemed to be witches.

639992,A223UJ9MON2Y8N,B00005JOC9,"Snape42 ""Toad, esq.""","[22, 52]","First off, I want to say that I enjoyed the book immensely for about the first 3/4 of the way through, then it unraveled at a most alarming rate and presented a terribly anti-climatic downward spiral to its dissappointing ending.  The reason for this is that Dan Brown's argument in the book implodes upon itself.  I am not trying to spark a religious debate here, I am talking about the context of the book, and what Dan Brown was trying to say with the DaVinci Code - Namely that Jesus Christ was not what Christian's make him out to be, and that the bloodline between he and Mary Magdelene was the alleged holy grail.  Okay, fine, I can play along for the sake of the book, but the more that Brown tried to prove this idea, the less sense it made.  The argument turned more to the fact that Christ was just a man.  Many people have made this claim before, it's not that radical. HOWEVER, if this is the argument, and Jesus was not divine, then why should anyone care who he was, much less about Mary Magdelene or their proginy?  See where I'm going with this?  It dosen't make sense.  Dan Brown also twists some historical events and places in a way that bothers me, that anyone with even a mediocre grasp on history can see through.  The movie was even worse.  It left out so much of the information from the book that was actually interesting, and haphazardly attempted to tell the story in patchy underdeveloped segments.  The actors themselves, even the great Tom Hanks, were not convincing in their roles - it was almost as though they were saying ""this story dosen't make sense to us either.""  The choppy editing proves that the editing team for this film had the same problem.  I've read the book, and there were still scenes in this film that left me puzzled.  On the whole, Brown had the ideas for a good conspiracy theory, he just did not develop them well enough to make his argument solid enough to hold water.

Therefore when I went in my expectations were quite low.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I enjoyed this intellectual treasure hunt.  Action sequences boldly intertwine with quieter scenes where codes and symbols are being deciphered to lead to the next clue.  At times we get the back story of what has happened to a persecuted religious sect through out the ages.  The flashbacks to ancient Rome are brief but beautiful.  In addition there are some gorgeous locations for filming, among them the Louvre and Rosslyn.Hanks and Tautou perform like the pros that they are--it is interesting that two actors known for their whimsical charms were cast in such serious roles. Generally  actors starring in thrillers will be those known for their laconic delivery and quietly passionate intensity.  However, Tom Hanks was playing a professor of symbology and as such he did a fine job.The supporting cast reads like a list of international superstars:  Alfred Molina, Ian McKellen, Jean Reno and Jurgen Prochnow--all were superb.One of things I liked about this film is how it gave the audience the opportunity to view the world from the perspective of someone who is used to looking at symbols and their meanings, in particular of things that most of us don't even notice most of the time. It was an unusual and fascinating angle on perception.This a movie that tries to pack some very deep concepts into the thriller/treasure hunt genre.

Of course, many can tell you there is always a risk when basing a movie off a book.  This runs that risk.  Fans of the book are expecting quite a bit.  Does it deliver?  Well, if you want the book, yes, it does.  However, despite that, the movie has its shortcomings, and I'm sorry to say they detract from the interesting story.  In short, the film all around could've been better.You probably already know the big plot of the book.  It hasn't sold over 40 million copies for nothing.  The movie is no different from the plot of the book.  All the puzzles and paintings are still there.  Not a whole lot has really been changed from the book.  If you're looking for an adaptation that follows the book fairly well, this is it.  That shouldn't suggest there aren't changes.  There are, and quite a few.  However, it keeps the basic structure of the book in tact, including all those twists.Ron Howard has also gone on to include some of his own puzzles for the audience.  However, that doesn't separate from the fact that the ""jaw-dropping"" twists are not really jaw-dropping.  The movie is so close to the book that there are no ""new"" twists presented at all.  This is great for purists of the book, but boring for those who expect a couple of added things.The movie has an all star cast.  Tom Hanks leads us through the mysteries of Da Vinci, but for Tom Hanks this performance is pretty shallow.  He's rather bland in this film, something I wouldn't have expected from Hanks at all.  At least in terms of what he's done in the past.  His lines are delivered rather dryly.  Audrey Tautau isn't much better.  Her performance isn't anything special either.  It's as if most of the actors don't care about their roles.  They're not emotional in times when they should be, not full of much life and compassion.However, despite that, Sir Ian Mckellen gives us something for our money.  He does a brilliant job as Teabing.  Not only does he come off as believable, but you get the feeling that he's not ""acting"" as Teabing, but rather that he IS Teabing.  He keeps the movie going when it seems to slow down, which happens quite a bit.This is the other thing about The Da Vinci Code.  Too much of the film is drowned out in dialogue and explanations.  The action is too few and far between.  The movie also moves at a ridiculously slow pace.  This makes for a rather boring movie.The Da Vinci Code is not a horrible movie, it's just a boring movie.  There's no guessing to be done, and the movie is drowned out in so much dialogue and explanations that the move is just unbearably slow.  This is a movie that one probably shouldn't waste the money for admission on.  Wait for a DVD release, or wait for it to come to television.

Directed by Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind helmer Ron Howard, The Da Vinci Code is a fascinating, complex tale that begins with the murder of Jacques Sauniere, a curator at the Musee du Louvre in Paris, while Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is speaking at a conference on symbology.  When Langdon is contacted by French police and taken to the Louvre, ostensibly to help the police with the case, that's where the fun begins!The story in The Da Vinci Code is a fast-paced one, but not so much so that the average viewer is left completely confused.  Written by A Beautiful Mind scribe Akiva Goldsman, the script tightens up the plot enough that it can be fitted into a 2 1/2 hour movie without leaving a person wondering if he's missed something.  I must admit, Mr. Goldsman has come a long way from Batman Forever!The choices in casting for this movie were very good as well.  Tom Hanks plays Langdon with a laconic, dry wit that reminds me somewhat of British historian Simon Schama, and Audrey Tautou is exquisite as Sophie Neveu, the granddaughter of Sauniere who harbors a very special secret, one unknown even to her.  Paul Bettany is engaging, yet frightening as the albino monk Silas, and Jean Reno excels in his role as Bezu Fache, the French cop who thinks that Langdon is the killer.  Lastly, there's the wonderfully diabolical Alfred Molina as Bishop Aringarosa, the Opus Dei priest who appears to be controlling the puppet strings at first, but who is being manipulated by a mysterious voice over the phone called the Teacher.Most of the arguments I've seen against The Da Vinci Code center around its presentation of historical myths such as the Priory of Sion and Mary Magdalene as the wife of Jesus as ""fact"".  With all respect to those who might use this as an excuse to trash The Da Vinci Code, let me say again what has already been repeated on here more than a dozen times: IT'S JUST A MOVIE.  I myself have seen several documentaries and read a not inconsiderable amount of literature that completely debunks the Priory of Sion and the presentation of Mary Magdalene as Jesus' wife and mother of the Merovingian line, yet I enjoy The Da Vinci Code because IT'S JUST A MOVIE.  No mystery there.When all is said and done, I heartily recommend The Da Vinci Code.

640001,A18CRS4FLVH5YW,B00005JOC9,"Star Sailor ""Worldwide Traveler""","[18, 30]","Back in the late 80's a film from Martin Scorcese was released that caused much of what the Davinci Code is exhibiting today.  Catholics and Christians alike were up in arms about how sacrelige and morally irresponsible ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" was when it was released to theatres.  I remember being challenged by that movie since I was a devout Christian and struggling with the idealism of what Christianity was all about.  Looking hindsight, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" helped me grow deeper with who God was to me rather than what he was to a church built by man's ideology.I believe things much differently 18 years later.Not because of a movie but because things like ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" made me ask the really tough questions that no one in any church really wants to ask.  Nor does anyone have a solid answer for.  So, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is considered probably one of my favorite movies of all time simply because it's thought provoking and means so much more now than it ever did back when I was impressionable and naive.  Aside from this review, I highly recommend ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" on DVD available from the Criterion Collection.As far as ""The Davinci Code,"" it's really all relative.  Dan Brown has created a work of fiction to ask the really tough and outlandish questions and in the meantime, put a little spin on things to make people think or in this case, make people laugh &lt;not funny>.  It's not gospel.  It's not trying to be anything but a thought provoking joy ride into the big question, ""Is your faith real?""  If so, why is it real?  How do you know?  What do you really believe?  Why do you believe it?  Unfortunately, ""The Davinci Code"" movie fails where ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" exponentially succeeds.  After watching ""Davinci"" I was simply unchallenged and bored.  Nothing in this movie exemplifies great story telling and isn't that what movies sort of need to suspend disbelief?  For those looking for 2 and a half hours of elite escapist entertainment, go see ""MI:3"" or wait until ""Superman Returns,"" because this movie simply doesn't fit the bill!  This is definitely NOT a ""summer"" movie by any means and I am quite surprised the studios thought this worthy of a summer opening.  If you're a fan of the book, the movie follows along fairly well but doesn't exceed expectations.  Tom Hanks has finally made a dud film in his long line of hits.

640002,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,B00005JOC9,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[0, 0]","XXXXXSome of the negative reactions for this movie (and the book it's based on) came from The Vatican, American Catholic Bishops, Peru, People's Republic of China (which eventually banned it), Pakistan (banned), Philippines (called for a ban), Thailand (called for a ban), Singapore (called for a ban), Samoa (banned), India (called for a ban), Sri Lanka (banned), Lebanon (banned).Most critics hated this movie.Therefore, this is just one bad movie, right?  Well, not so fast.Consider this:This movie earned two hundred and thirty million dollars in its opening weekend.  So far, it has brought in over seven hundred and fifty million (well over its budget costs of one hundred and twenty five million).This is a mystery movie directed by Ron Howard (who also co-produced).  It was adapted from the international bestselling novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" (2003) by Dan Brown (who also was co-executive producer of this movie).Both Harvard religious symbolist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and French police cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) become accidentally involved in a quest for the legendary Holy Grail (cup used by Jesus at the Last Supper).  Both, as well, are pursued by French police Captain Fache (Jean Reno).Also searching for the Grail is a secret group within the Opus Dei (an institution of the Roman Catholic Church that teaches that everyone is called to holiness), who wish to keep the true Grail a secret since the revelation of this secret would probably destroy Christianity.  One person (actually enforcer) who especially wants the true secret to be kept is an albino monk named Silas (Paul Bettany).On their quest for the Grail, both Langdon and Neveu have to consult with noted British Grail historian Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen).  Also, along the way they encounter anagrams (rearranging the letters of a word or phrase), puzzles, mathematical numbers, paintings by Leonardo da Vinci, etc.All actors do descent jobs in their roles but I have to give special kudos to Paul Bettany as the albino monk Silas.This movie has it all: mystery, action, good background music, and suspense.One of the few critics who gave this movie a good rating was Roger Ebert.  He said, ""This movie works, it's involving, intriguing, and constantly seems on the edge of startling revelations.""  I enthusiastically agree with this statement.Finally, the DVD set (special edition released in 2006) has ten behind-the-scenes featurettes on the second disc. (I found on the back of the DVD case that Tom Hanks name is excluded from the credits!!)Oh, I almost forgot.  Dan Brown walked away with a cool six million dollars when the film rights for this movie were purchased from him!!!In conclusion, this is actually quite a good movie.  If you don't want to read the novel it's based on, I strongly recommend viewing this movie.  I leave you with one of the key anagrams found in this movie for you to decipher:""O, Draconian devil.  Oh, lame saint.""(2006; 2hr, 20 min excluding end credits;  wide screen;  24 scenes; 2 discs)&lt;&lt;Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX",5,"""Why does it have to be human or divine?

640003,A303AOOHDU1VZ2,B00005JOC9,Stephen Smith,"[2, 5]","Six years ago Ron Howard probed the inner workings of the mind of Nobel Prize-winner John Nash; one of the most striking features of that story was the complete absence of any religious thought. In this movie, Howard has seen a chance to toy with the legacy of another great mind - Leonardo da Vinci - and immerse himself in the sort of religious controversy that the historical Leonardo seemed to avoid. Make no mistake about it: da Vinci is a major character in this movie.  The plausibleness of the clues that can be read into his paintings and the cunning workings of his devices keep this murder mystery moving. The bits and pieces will tease your imagination if you relax and agree to let yourself be entertained. If the razzle-dazzle doesn't always keep your interest, the moments of unintended humor often will. Early in the story, the crime scene investigators are gathered around the victim, who is lying spread-eagled on his back and completely naked; the cameraman uses all sorts of tricks to avoid showing the man's genitals, and the result is as comical as Home Improvement's ploys to conceal Wilson's face.Is the movie anti-Catholic? Definitely. The bad guys are not simply Catholic clergymen -- they are pillars of the church hierarchy. Howard tries to ameliorate the slander by tacking on three successive endings, with three different shades of interpretation, but he seems to be plunging in over his depth. What disarms this movie is not its ultimately reverential tone, but its completely muddled approach to religious thought. It is so illogical and self-contradictory that it seems silly to protest against it; it is like debating with a puppet.Catholic parents should have serious reservations about the potential for confusion here, but otherwise there is nothing intrinsically morally objectionable about the dialogue or the images.

640005,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00005JOC9,Steven Aldersley,"[2, 2]","Did you see The Hunger Games and read the books because everyone was talking about it this year? How about The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo three years ago? We live in a world in which hype can have a huge effect on people's behavior. It drove the Harry Potter franchise a decade ago, and I'm sure you can list other examples dating back to Jaws, The Exorcist, or even Psycho, if you are old enough. Well, in 2006, The Da Vinci Code was the must-read book and the must-see movie of the moment.Did the reality match the buzz?Despite grossing $758 million, it's surprising that The Da Vinci Code is regarded as a failure by so many people. One common complaint is that Tom Hanks' hair looked silly. I guess it says something about the movie if you are focusing on that aspect? I've read the book, seen the movie, bought it on DVD twice, upgraded to Blu-ray, and I have never understood all the negativity surrounding Ron Howard's adaptation of Dan Brown's novel. By the way, the novel also received a lot of negative comments claiming that the writing was terrible.I have come to the conclusion that many of the negative comments are due to the perception that the movie is attacking religion. There is a long sequence in which we are shown an alternative interpretation of Da Vinci's The Last Supper. I won't reveal the details, but I would imagine that scene is the source of the trouble for most of the viewers who objected to the subject matter. I find it a little disturbing that people who supposedly believe completely in something can feel threatened by a story which contradicts those beliefs.Would you avoid seeing Alien because you don't believe such creatures exist? They are stories, intended to entertain, not documentaries claiming to depict actual events. The Harry Potter franchise is not evil or damaging to children. I'm also disappointed that Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy was abandoned after The Golden Compass. Again, it's probably because of the perceived religious stance. We lost what could have been an incredible trilogy, but you can still read the books.Anyway, enough of that, while I still have a few readers left.The Da Vinci Code is a mystery and something of a treasure hunt. Robert Langdon (Hanks) is a professor who is promoting his latest book. The book deals with symbology, and explains the origin of some of the symbols and clothing that we may have encountered during our lives. Hanks is convincing in the role and we see him delivering a lecture, in Paris, at the start of the story. Before he can finish signing books for the crowd, he's approached by the French police; they claim to need his help in explaining an unusual murder, so he accompanies them to the crime scene inside the Louvre.The murdered man is Louvre curator, Jacques Sauni&egrave;re. He's naked and has apparently arranged himself in the same position as Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. He's also left other messages, and one mentions Langdon. It's here that Langdon encounters Sophie Neveu (Tautou), who is a police cryptologist. But unlike the other police, she appears to have an agenda of her own. She teams up with Langdon and they attempt to solve the riddles left in Sauni&egrave;re's message.Although the running time in the extended version is just short of three hours, the pacing makes the movie feel much shorter. The revelations are frequent and make the viewer feel as if they are involved in the story. It would be wrong to reveal any more of the movie's secrets because it's better if you experience them for yourself.The story won't work if you analyze what's happening too closely. After all, it contains an albino monk (Bettany), a priest who is more concerned with money and power than religion (Molina), and a historian (McKellen) who is obsessed with the Holy Grail. When you look at the movie in that light, it's clearly nonsense, but so is the Indiana Jones franchise, and that's held in high regard by both critics and moviegoers.The Da Vinci Code also introduced a lot of people to Audrey Tautou. She has produced some incredible work, starring in Amelie, A Very Long Engagement, and Coco Avant Chanel, but American audiences finally had the chance to see her appear in an English-language movie. If you are a fan, I urge you to give Amelie a try. However, I may be biased as I think she's the most beautiful actress since Irene Jacob graced our screens in The Double Life of Veronique and Three Colors Red.The movie has a little action, but it will work better for fans of mysteries. The conclusion does leave us with a few questions, but it's quite satisfying nonetheless.Tom Hanks had some incredible roles in the 90s, and was arguably the best actor in that decade, but we haven't seen any memorable performances from him since Cast Away (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). His biggest successes in the last decade came as a voice actor for Pixar. Although The Da Vinci Code is far from perfect, I always find it enjoyable, and would rate it as Hanks' best role in the past ten years. Angels & Demons also features the Robert Langdon character, played by Hanks. It wasn't a box office success, so it's unclear whether The Lost Symbol will ever be made.If you are open to preposterous stories, you might find that The Da Vinci Code is a lot better than people would have you believe. It's certainly better than National Treasure. Fans of Hanks and mysteries should take a look.

Of course, historic accuracy was not an intent of the movie nor the book on which it was based.  But such statements as implying that the Gnostic sects portrayed Jesus Christ as more man than diety is the polar opposite of what those sects taught.  Gnostics, like many sects, saw the physical world as inherently evil and therefore tended to argue that Jesus could not have been a physical man at all - or that his physical nature was subdued by his spiritual nature in some way.  Quite contrary to the theory of the Da Vinci Code protagonists.  That one inaccuracy alone should be sufficient to demonstrate the questionable theories some have claimed for the movie and the book.  It cannot be taken seriously as an historical treatise of any kind but it can be accepted as entertaining action adventure.  Those who aspire to or hate the theories of the protagonists perhaps take movies too seriously.

This is not one of those films that you can pop into the DVD player and watch while your mind is elsewhere; this is a movie that needs to be viewed with articulate attention. I was halfway through the movie before I knew what it was actually about. I have talked to others who have said that reading the book before viewing  the film helps the viewer in understanding the characters and story so I would advised that first. But if you haven't got access to the book here is what I surmised from the viewing of the movie: the main story focuses on the allegation that Jesus Christ actually fatherd a child and had a girl named Sarah. Sarah's  blood line exists to this day much to the chagrin of the Catholic Church. The movie dramitizes certain members who are Roman Catholic determined not to have this knowledge of that bloodline become known. Leonardo Da Vinci's portrait of the last supper has clues and hints of this new knowledge of Christ and that is major plot of the film and alas the ""Da Vinci Code"" comes from this. The film became one of the biggest blockbusters in motion picture history while at the same time becoming very controversial with conservative Catholics. At nearly two and half hours long the movie makes the viewer think if these allegations of Christ are true. The film is extremely well-acted by Tom Hanks and the rest of the cast and Ron Howard did a virtuoso job as director filming the movie entirely in Europe.

Of course, as is the problem with most big screen adaptations of novels, it strays off too far in a few places, completely changing some of the major points of the book.  After Jacques Sauniere (Marielle) is murdered inside the Louvre, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to the scene, where he is unknowingly the prime suspect. The body, under careful watch by the stern Captain Fache (Reno), is positioned into the shape of Da Vinci's famous Vitruvian Man with a cryptic message written above his head. Langdon learns that Sauniere did all of the positioning, messaging, and blood-writings to himself as he slowly died of a bullet wound to the stomach. Sophie Neveu (Tautou), a French cryptographer, appears at the screen to tell Fache that she decoded the message written above Sauniere's head and that it means nothing. However, she is really there to warn Langdon and to help him escape the Louvre without being arrested. The pair find themselves on a thrilling adventure on a most unusual quest. What they discover may very well shake the very foundation of Christianity and turn the Church upside-down. So Dark the Con of Man.This film is not a documentary but plays itself so, on the book's behalf. It had entertainment potential by bringing greater human expression, interaction, and animation to the screen, but its greatest mistake, ironically is too closely following the black and white of the book. These characters could be more lively, interesting, and emotionally layered, without sacrificing the fiction's storyline. As reinforcement, poetic license could be more generously utilized. By evidence, it is under utilized, downgrading our mental engagement and enthusiasm, for such a potentially interesting, intellectual, and mystical ancient story of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and the Holy Grail. Such intriguing inquiry is only threatening to selfish, greedy, and inadaptable religious ""experts."" If the autobiography of Jesus was available, it would probably be the world's number one seller of all time.Tom Hanks was not overly charismatic as Robert Langdon, but that is precisely the bookish Everyman who is the protagonist of Dan Brown's novel. As Sophie, Audrey Tatou was more dynamic than Robert, as appropriate to her character as well; there was a sparking and even radiant quality to this young performer. The supporting cast was solid with Jean Reno especially successful in developing multiple layers of characterization in the morally conflicted detective Bezu Fache. Perhaps most memorably, Ian McKellen delivers a star turn as the scholar Leigh Teabing.  Paul Bettany plays his role under the skin of the character. Everything about him is creepy, from scars to buns of steel. Ron Howard's stylish approach to the film includes interesting camera angles, especially in the aerial shots of such great location sites as the Louvre in the Paris and the Rosslyn chapel in Scotland. It was clear that Howard wanted not merely an action picture, but a leisurely paced retelling of Dan Brown's story. There was also the thoughtful use of close-ups in the more intimate moments with a brilliant analytical scene dissecting the controversial ""chalice"" apparent in Leonardo's ""Last Supper.""  The film has enough shortcomings, but undeniably does not fall short of clearly laying out the book's story, clue by clue, scene by scene.  All in all, 'The Da Vinci Code' is a fun detective film with a unique twist, retaining the excitement and thrills that made the novel such a page-turner.

640018,A26JW6X5OBSS7C,B00005JOC9,Thomas Aurelius,"[4, 13]","I'm not going to proceed to judge this movie on the unhistoricity of the claims it makes about Christianity.  By now, thanks to this film and the book of the same title, most individuals interested in Christology should be aware that this story is nothing more than ignis fatuus.  That being said, I will make this critique based on the quality and presentability of the film, and not on the controversies it has stirred within certain caucuses.As a movie the Code leaves much to be desired.  There are gaps in the storyline and overlooked pieces of evidence in the Louvre Museum by the police that no respectable law enforcement agency would fail to detect.  For example, Langdon and detective Neveu, after successfully evading Captain Feche in the museum, strike a series of clues (writings, bloodstains, keys) that the entire investigatory team analyzing the crime scene failed to uncover.  In this museum, which has become the depository of some of the most consequential and prestigious works of art in the history of civilization, are there no cameras?  They have - as seen in the film - an iron fence that deploys  from above when a painting is removed from its position.  Why then did Detective Feche, or any of his detectives, not consult, or at least request,  video that might lift suspicion of Langdon and expose the real killer of the museum's curator?  Continuing with the unconvincing,  Langdon and Detective Neveu fail to ask each other seemingly obvious questions that - if answered - might end the movie immediately or take it in a whole new direction.  Ian McKellen, a fabulous actor of extraordinary talent, lacks complete credibility in this film.So what went catastrophically wrong?  Well, it wasn't the book or its author Dan Brown who has been selling copies of the Code faster then they can print them.  And although the performances were at best questionable, by themselves these are not enough to sink the movie.  The most obvious answer as to why the Code is so deficient is Ron Howard, the director.  Mr. Howard simply lacked the vision and forethought to successfully and credibly present The Da Vinci Code in a manner believable (as a film, not history) to the audience. I think most individuals who gave this film favorable ratings were captured by the mystery and romantic luster most conspiracies are imbued with, and had a pre-formulated supposition of Jesus and his relationship to Mary Magdalene.",1,I Expected Better,1163894400,"11 19, 2006",2006,2433,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'proceed', 'judge', 'movie', 'unhistoricity', 'claims', 'Christianity', 'now', 'thanks', 'film', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'most', 'individuals', 'interested', 'Christology', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'story', 'nothing', 'more', 'ignis', 'fatuus', 'being', 'said', 'will', 'make', 'critique', 'based', 'quality', 'presentability', 'film', 'not', 'controversies', 'stirred', 'certain', 'caucuses.As', 'movie', 'Code', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'are', 'gaps', 'storyline', 'overlooked', 'pieces', 'evidence', 'Louvre', 'Museum', 'police', 'respectable', 'law', 'enforcement', 'agency', 'would', 'fail', 'detect', 'example', 'Langdon', 'detective', 'Neveu', 'successfully', 'evading', 'Captain', 'Feche', 'museum', 'strike', 'series', 'clues', 'writings', 'bloodstains', 'keys', 'entire', 'investigatory', 'team', 'analyzing', 'crime', 'scene', 'failed', 'uncover', 'museum', 'become', 'depository', 'most', 'consequential', 'prestigious', 'works', 'art', 'history', 'civilization', 'are', 'there', 'cameras', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'iron', 'fence', 'when', 'painting', 'removed', 'position', 'Why', 'then', 'did', 'Detective', 'Feche', 'detectives', 'not', 'consult', 'least', 'request', 'video', 'might', 'lift', 'suspicion', 'Langdon', 'expose', 'real', 'killer', 'museum', 'curator', 'Continuing', 'unconvincing', 'Langdon', 'Detective', 'Neveu', 'fail', 'ask', 'other', 'seemingly', 'obvious', 'questions', 'answered', 'might', 'end', 'movie', 'immediately', 'take', 'whole', 'new', 'direction', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'fabulous', 'actor', 'extraordinary', 'talent', 'complete', 'credibility', 'film.So', 'what', 'went', 'catastrophically', 'wrong', 'Well', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'author', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'who', 'been', 'selling', 'copies', 'Code', 'faster', 'then', 'can', 'print', 'performances', 'were', 'best', 'questionable', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'sink', 'movie', 'most', 'obvious', 'answer', 'why', 'Code', 'so', 'deficient', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'director', 'Mr.', 'Howard', 'simply', 'lacked', 'vision', 'forethought', 'successfully', 'credibly', 'present', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'manner', 'believable', 'film', 'not', 'history', 'audience', 'think', 'most', 'individuals', 'who', 'gave', 'film', 'favorable', 'ratings', 'were', 'captured', 'mystery', 'romantic', 'luster', 'most', 'conspiracies', 'are', 'imbued', 'had', 'pre-formulated', 'supposition', 'Jesus', 'relationship', 'Mary', 'Magdalene']",N/A

640021,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JOC9,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 3]","After listening to a couple of reviews of ""The Da Vinci Code"", I wasn't expecting a lot. It has been a long time since I have heard such universally bad word of mouth regarding a film; people laughed and hissed during the screening at Cannes, it received a bad review on a local NPR station, practically every website has lambasted the film. But I went anyway, so I could give you my honest and true opinion.It wasn't that bad.Now, you may be asking yourself. ""Wow, thornhill says the movie wasn't that bad. Maybe..."" Stop for a moment. Do you really want to spend $8 or $11 on a film that `wasn't that bad'? While ""The Da Vinci Code"" is not the worst film I have ever seen, it is certainly far from a good film.I have the same problems with the movie that I had with the book. The book is a fun read, a good page turner, but it isn't a great piece of literature. The author does what many authors do nowadays; they write their books to be made into films. As you are reading a chapter, it will suddenly end. A new chapter will pick up with a different character and location, and then it will stop. The next chapter will pick up where the first ended. In other words, he is writing the scenes of the `movie', editing his book much like a film. Also, when movies are made based on books, they generally streamline the dialogue, characters and action. If a book is already written this way, what options do the filmmakers have? Either they add dialogue, character and action or they further streamline it. In the case of ""Da Vinci"", they further streamlined it, making it less interesting and more movie-like. They have watered down something that was already watered down.Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), a Professor of Religious Symbology at Harvard, is in Paris to give a lecture. During the lecture, Jacques Sauniere, the curator of the Louvre, is murdered by an albino monk (Paul Bettany). Before he dies, the curator leaves a series of clues for Langdon and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), a police woman who turns out to be Sauniere's granddaughter. The local police chief, Bezo Feche (Jean Reno), immediately suspects Langdon of the murder and chases them through France and England. Along the way, a mysterious Bishop (Alfred Molina) plots to reveal the secret Sauniere, Langdon and Neveu are trying to keep. Along the way, Langdon meets an old friend, Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellan), who has spent his life trying to decipher the Da Vinci Code. Along the way, they run into members of mysterious branches of the Catholic Church and religious history, including Opus Dei, the Knights Templar and more.Directed by Ron Howard and written by Akiva Goldsman, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is perfectly serviceable at times, but also a bit amateurish and `TV movie of the week-ish"" at others.There is zero chemistry between Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou. They only appear to even like each other towards the middle of the film. Until that point, they are thrown together by circumstance and seem merely to tolerate one another, realizing they each have information the other needs. Granted, Tom Hanks is quite a bit older than Audrey Tatou, but you might expect some sort of chemistry to appear, to make them attached to one another by more than circumstance.The supporting cast is generally acceptable. Paul Bettany is the most interesting as a weird Albino monk who believes he must cleanse himself of his sins with self-flagellation. Alfred Molina's Bishop is a bit too mob-like, but interesting as well, providing a caricature of what extremes someone will go to keep a secret. Jean Reno appears bored as the police inspector. Sir Ian McKellan is interesting as the obsessed historian, but his performance contains so much exposition, you lose the train of thought after a while.The main problem with the film is there is so much exposition. In virtually every scene, two or three characters are discussing various aspects of religious symbology. In many, one character will posit a theory and Langdon, Neveu or Teabing will contradict them and explain why they are wrong. This happens over and over again. It reminded me of early sound films. Because the technology was new and big, they couldn't move the microphones very much, for fear of creating static, or making it difficult to hear the actors. The result? In many early sound films, the actors stand together, in front of the camera, talking, much like a stage play. Not exactly the most engrossing method of storytelling. Howard seems to have borrowed this approach. The few, brief action sequences are spread throughout the almost 2 hour 30 minute film, leaving a lot of room for people standing around talking. ""The Da Vinci Code"" is meant to be part thriller, part mystery. When one of the characters says ""I need to get to a library, quick!"" you have to wonder how much time they invested in making the film exciting. Worse yet, they don't even go to a library.As Langdon and Neveu hold their various lectures for the other cast members, they frequently stare off into space, thinking of what they are saying. As they do this, they begin to imagine the events as they unfold. Or, these same thoughts help them uncover a long buried secret propelling them to the next mystery. Director Howard uses these moments to bleed images of these events into the frame, in some allowing actors to recreate, in others, panning across images or statues. It is an interesting way of enlarging the action, increasing the scope, but it also reminded me of a History Channel or National Geographic Channel special. I half expected to see people running from an erupting Mount Vesuvius.I think Director Howard was a little out of his league with this film. He does a much better job with dramas and family comedies than he does with ""Da Vinci"". In an early scene, we track the progress of Sauniere as he runs through the Louvre. Yet, Howard places the camera above him, behind dirty panes of glass and lead work, making it difficult to follow the progress. Ultimately, this robs the scene of any suspense it may have had.I honestly don't understand why so many people are offended by the subject matter of ""The Da Vinci Code"". Author Dan Brown uses a number of historical events, ideas and bits of legend to craft his tale. It is an interesting theory, but keep in mind the book is published as a piece of fiction. I don't think anyone should assume that Brown is attempting to write a factual representation of history. He has combined various true-life elements, with his own theories and thriller elements to create a readable page-turner.The movie seems very faithful to the book (or my memory of the book, its been a while since I read it) and that's unfortunate. This was a good opportunity for the filmmaker's to improve upon the book, strengthen the action, the dialogue, and the characters, make it a great thriller, to be remembered for the ages.Instead, they created a visual lecture, the perfect companion piece to a book many millions have already read.",3,So Dark The Mediocrity of Man,1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,7001,"['listening', 'couple', 'reviews',

The story was laughably sophomoric twaddle rooted, apparently, in little besides a fanciful, highly subjective observation of the characters Leonardo painted in ""The Last Supper"".  Leonardo was, of course, a genius, but I doubt that even he could have ""seen"" what the Disciples looked like, coming as he did, about one thousand five hundred years after the fact.  But the scenery, sets, and atmosphere in the movie were great.  The story itself was so bad that it frequently required long, wearisome pedantic narratives so that the audience would be able to absorb at least the flimsy underpinnings of the ""plot"".  This, in turn, produced some of the most wooden, ineffective acting I've seen in a ""major league"" movie in a long time.They enlisted Ian McKellen (Gandalf, in LOTR) to explain this nonsense of Mary Magdalene having a baby with Jesus to continue Christ's bloodline, and I suppose Mr McKellen did a better job of it than anyone else could have done, although what the purpose of an extended ""bloodline"" would be to anyone, Christian or non-Christian, is an enigma. If you are a Christian, there's no need for a continued physical ""bloodline"" in the world. If you're not a Christian, it's silly to imagine that Christians were plotting to ""take over"" in a world dominated by the Roman Empire.  Continue the ""bloodline"" of a failed, counterfeit ""messiah""?  For what reason?

No, it would take God Himself to bring down the Roman Empire, not some human poor ""bloodline"" remnant being tormented like an animal by the Roman Governor and the Jewish Sanhedrin.To keep it from sagging under its own implausible inertia, the film is kept moving as a procession of ""who's got the football"" series of puzzle-solving movements (Tom Hank's contribution to the exercise).

This movie was a complete disappointment.  The first mistake was casting Tom Hanks as Langdon.  I understand that Hanks is a great actor and I enjoy him in most everything he has done.  But, he was the wrong choice for this role.  Some people are meant to play certain characters and Hanks was just not meant to play a character like Langdon.I am not sure even casting someone else would have done this movie any good. It would have been a good start, but this movie would have been bad even if someone else played Langdon.  The movie did not flow well, it left out things of importance and it changed aspects of the story for reasons that did not make sense.  If I had not read the book, this movie would have been not only boring but confusing.  The fact that I read the book was the only reason I was able to sit through the entire film.One other note, I feel bad that Audrey Tautou has been getting a bad rap by many who have seen the film.

In many ways Ron Howard is the perfect director for it - he still can't create a decent suspense sequence in a thriller but, unashamedly populist and one of the directors least likely to overestimate his audience's intelligence, he keeps things fairly clear and surprisingly inoffensive: it's more likely to be the atheists looking for a flag to rally around who'll feel betrayed than the religious, with the film going to pains to emphasise that being mortal need not invalidate Jesus' message or the value of faith. Indeed, the villain turns out not to be a church figure but the kind of obsessive conspiracy nut who probably makes up the novel's target audience, albeit one ingeniously using the Church as his own personal hitman.The film does a surprisingly imaginative job of illustrating the film's extensive exposition with everything from PowerPoint and computer graphics presentations to some visually striking flashbacks that are also well invoked to imply memories, phobias and personal backstories, while the script has fun setting up various characters as the villain-in-chief only to pull the rug from under you. Even the constant puzzles that drive the story like some sudoko thriller are generally presented in a pleasingly cinematic manner. The film's big conspiracy - hardly a secret people will kill to cover up since it's been the subject of books for decades - doesn't hold water for a second, relying on finding connections and patterns where none exist, altering pictures to change their meaning and quoting apocryphal works and offering speculation as fact in such a way that the same method could probably also be used to prove that the secret child of Top Cat and Judy Jetson is the true heir to the throne of Great Britain, but at least the film's hero is allowed to puncture some of the more absurd elements as pure conjecture or disproven nonsense (provoking the inevitable ""That's what they want you to think!"" response) before finally seeing the light. There's also something rather nave in the story's belief that if the big story is finally revealed, all war and sexual oppression will disappear overnight, something only underlined by the killer's over-the-top final moments.It's generally well cast (even if Tom Hanks pronunciation is a little odd at times while actors like Jean-Pierre Marielle are wasted on nothing parts) and has a surprising amount of momentum and drive before things slow to a crawl for the lengthy epilogue, while Hans Zimmer throws in an effective score, making for a surprisingly entertaining cinematic scavenger hunt.",3,Enjoyable hokum - as long as you don't take it too seriously,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,2697,"['almost', 'universally', 'derided', 'hugely', 'successful', 'DaVinci', 'Code', 'out', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'hokum', 'many', 'ways', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'perfect', 'director', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'create', 'decent', 'suspense', 'sequence', 'thriller', 'unashamedly', 'populist', 'one', 'directors', 'least', 'likely', 'overestimate', 'audience', 'intelligence', 'things', 'fairly', 'clear', 'surprisingly', 'inoffensive', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'atheists', 'looking', 'flag', 'rally', 'around', 'who', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'betrayed', 'religious', 'film', 'going', 'pains', 'emphasise', 'being', 'mortal', 'need', 'not', 'invalidate', 'Jesus', 'message', 'value', 'faith', 'Indeed', 'villain', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'church', 'figure', 'kind', 'obsessive', 'conspiracy', 'nut', 'who', 'probably', 'up', 'novel', 'target', 'audience', 'one', 'ingeniously', 'using', 'Church', 'own', 'personal', 'hitman.The', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'imaginative', 'job', 'illustrating', 'film', 'extensive', 'exposition', 'everything', 'PowerPoint', 'computer', 'graphics', 'presentations', 'visually', 'striking', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'invoked', 'imply', 'memories', 'phobias', 'personal', 'backstories', 'script', 'fun', 'setting', 'up', 'various', 'characters', 'villain-in-chief', 'only', 'pull', 'rug', 'Even', 'constant', 'puzzles', 'drive', 'story', 'sudoko', 'thriller', 'are', 'generally', 'presented', 'pleasingly', 'cinematic', 'manner', 'film', 'big', 'conspiracy', 'hardly', 'secret', 'people', 'will', 'kill', 'cover', 'up', 'been', 'subject', 'books', 'decades', ""n't"", 'hold', 'water', 'second', 'relying', 'finding', 'connections', 'patterns', 'where', 'none', 'exist', 'altering', 'pictures', 'change', 'meaning', 'quoting', 'apocryphal', 'works', 'offering', 'speculation', 'fact', 'such', 'way', 'same', 'method', 'could', 'probably', 'also', 'be', 'used', 'prove', 'secret', 'child', 'Top', 'Cat', 'Judy', 'Jetson', 'true', 'heir', 'throne', 'Great', 'Britain', 'least', 'film', 'hero', 'allowed', 'puncture', 'more', 'absurd', 'elements', 'pure', 'conjecture', 'disproven', 'nonsense', 'provoking', 'inevitable', 'what', 'want', 'think', 'response', 'finally', 'seeing', 'light', 'also', 'something', 'rather', 'nave', 'story', 'belief', 'big', 'story', 'finally', 'revealed', 'war', 'sexual', 'oppression', 'will', 'disappear', 'overnight', 'something', 'only', 'underlined', 'killer', 'over-the-top', 'final', 'moments.It', 'generally', 'well', 'cast', 'even', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'pronunciation', 'little', 'odd', 'times', 'actors', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Marielle', 'are', 'wasted', 'nothing', 'parts', 'surprising', 'amount', 'momentum', 'drive', 'things', 'slow', 'crawl', 'lengthy', 'epilogue', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'throws', 'effective', 'score', 'making', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'cinematic', 'scavenger', 'hunt']",N/A

I actually bought the book a few years ago, but only finally finished reading it about a month ago.  I was quite turned off by the unsophisticated writing style.For me, The Da Vinci Code is not a terrific film, for several reasons.  There's little chemistry between Tom Hanks' professor Robert Langdon and Audrey Tautou' cryptographer Sophie Neveu.  Hanks' performance was passionless and devoid of intensity.  In fact, this was among his worst acting jobs ever. Paul Bettany was one-dimensional but all right as the creepy albino monk into self-flagellation, and devoted servant of Opus Dei, Silas.  Sir Ian McKellan was very good as the rich eccentric historian Leigh Teabing.  Jean Reno was his usual dour self as Capt Fache while Alfred Molina was credible as the conniving Bishop Aringarosa of Opus Dei.What made the book mildly interesting, when the puzzles are revealed to the reader and is now able to participate in solving them, is not as big a part of the film. The intrigue of the puzzles was the heart of the book to me and its been eviscerated in exchange for condensing the story into a film experience of just over two hours.  This film would have had a much better chance of succeeding as an 8-hour, four part weekly made for television mini-series, later to be sold to adoring fans around Christmas on DVD.Ron Howard was the wrong guy to direct it the film.  He's excellent as a director of dramas, but he hasn't distinguished himself in the thriller genre.  Or perhaps, he did the best he could with the screen play. Despite the combining of facts with fiction to provide an intriguing tale, the book failed to capitalize on its strengths and ended up being a disappointment and it would have been a miracle to extract a great screen play from it.  Still, the producers should have gambled on a director better known for excitement and intrigue rather than the melodramatic.",2,"mediocre, should have been a mini-series",1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,2036,"['Triniman', 'Blog', 'Blogcritics', 'Desicritics.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'book', 'people', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'actually', 'bought', 'book', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'finally', 'finished', 'reading', 'month', 'ago', 'was', 'quite', 'turned', 'off', 'unsophisticated', 'writing', 'style.For', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'not', 'terrific', 'film', 'several', 'reasons', 'little', 'chemistry', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'professor', 'Robert', 'Langdon', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'cryptographer', 'Sophie', 'Neveu', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'was', 'passionless', 'devoid', 'intensity', 'fact', 'was', 'worst', 'acting', 'jobs', 'ever', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'was', 'one-dimensional', 'right', 'creepy', 'albino', 'monk', 'self-flagellation', 'devoted', 'servant', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'Silas', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'rich', 'eccentric', 'historian', 'Leigh', 'Teabing', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'was', 'usual', 'dour', 'self', 'Capt', 'Fache', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'was', 'credible', 'conniving', 'Bishop', 'Aringarosa', 'Opus', 'Dei.What', 'made', 'book', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'when', 'puzzles', 'are', 'revealed', 'reader', 'now', 'able', 'participate', 'solving', 'not', 'as', 'big', 'part', 'film', 'intrigue', 'puzzles', 'was', 'heart', 'book', 'been', 'eviscerated', 'exchange', 'condensing', 'story', 'film', 'experience', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'chance', 'succeeding', '8-hour', 'four', 'part', 'made', 'television', 'mini-series', 'later', 'be', 'sold', 'adoring', 'fans', 'Christmas', 'DVD.Ron', 'Howard', 'was', 'wrong', 'guy', 'direct', 'film', 'excellent', 'director', 'dramas', ""n't"", 'distinguished', 'thriller', 'genre', 'perhaps', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'screen', 'play', 'combining', 'facts', 'fiction', 'provide', 'intriguing', 'tale', 'book', 'failed', 'capitalize', 'strengths', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'disappointment', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'miracle', 'extract', 'great', 'screen', 'play', 'Still', 'producers', 'should', 'have', 'gambled', 'director', 'better', 'known', 'excitement', 'intrigue', 'rather', 'melodramatic']",N/A

Oh, puhleeze. Religion aside, as someone who has studied Biblical history and archaeology for years, this is too sad a piece of work to be taken seriously as any kind of scholarship.  As one who used to not believe in Yahusha, aka Jesus Christ, I can see how this would lead many of the naive into more and more Hollywood sloppy-think.  Still I gotta wonder, how many people who know anything about the Messiah really think His true followers would be having weird sex rituals complete with satanic looking garb?  (Uh, could that scene be a good hint as to where this story is reeeally coming from?  Just a thought, now!)  Gimme a break!  Well, countless numbers have been desperately trying to destroy the Word for thousands of years with and without Hollywood.  Without success.  The Word of YHWH still stands and will, mho, forever.  Historical research, fulfilled prophecy and archaeological findings confirm it's truth more and more as time goes by.  But really, though it is good to know what history actually reveals, one has to have an actual encounter with Yahusha to truly find out how wonderful He and His omnipotent and healing Love are.  If one has that, then one can withstand the lies and the fairy tales even if one never has the time or inclination to get seriously into historical studies.

640036,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JOC9,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 7]","`Lukewarm' is the word to describe the latest collaboration of Tom Hanks and Ron Howard. Even the avid fans of the actor would admit `The Da Vinci Code' is not his best movie, turgid and bloated, far cry from the thrills of `Apollo 13.' Whatever the sin the film committed, it is not about the religious content of the original book that caused some controversy because the film, knowing the risk they are running, avoids offering the definite solution to the `code.' That's OK, I understand. But if the film fails to entertain us as thriller, mystery, or whatever it is, that's something I cannot forgiveThe extraordinary plot of the book is brought to the screen, and it became more impossible, even ridiculous at times. The murder of a curator in Louvre brings two principal characters Prof. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and cryptologist Sophie Neveau (Audrey Tautou) to the museum. They are so clever that they can crack the elaborate codes left on the crime scene within ten minutes. but what is the fun of watching the mystery solved so easily? Or what kind of a murder victim can think of leaving such elaborated message while he is dying?[SAVED BY A PIGEON] From the weak beginning, the film never gets better. There is a brief, unexciting car chase in the Paris streets (by Audrey Tautou's cryptologist ... do you believe that?). The `bad' guys are represented by Silas, fanatical believer and assassin played by over-the-top Paul Bettany, and Bishop Aringarosa, miscast Alfred Molina. When the professor is in danger, he is miraculously saved by a pigeon. But Tom Hanks seems comfortable with this unbelievable situation, even with his terrible haircut.But what is most shocking to me is the disappointing acting from two French actors - Audrey Tautou and Jean Reno. You don't find the charming Amelie or Mathilde, or the super-cool Leon. They are surely doing their best, but clearly they are not comfortable with the roles they are playing, knowing that they should be doing films with Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Luc Besson.The only winner in the film is Ian McKellen, whose witty and amusing acting as eccentric Sir Leigh Teabing, suddenly lights up the imagination of the cardboard characters that peopled the film, and makes them more tolerably human. Tom Hanks seems enjoying acting with him, and even willing to let him steal the scenes.After all, `The Da Vinci Code' is not as bad as you might be led to believe. It is gorgeous to see, and as I said, there is Ian McKellen's delightful performance. But the overlong film does not offer the thrills of encoding and decoding; it only gives us bits of mediocre mystery, bits of familiar family drama, and not-so-fresh conspiracy theory.

640037,A2G8IR6ENZSQHF,B00005JOC9,"T. Tiraterra ""Fluffy""","[2, 6]","For a second, I'm going to ignore the controversy surrounding ""The Da Vinci Code,"" since in many ways this movie does not deserve such controversy at all.  ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a watchable and at times enjoyable thriller, but considering it's an event picture, it's definitely a disappointment.  I haven't read Dan Brown's book, but from what I see in this movie it's either the empty mass market pulp its critics claim it is, or it's one of those books that works in written word but not on the screen.To be fair, no one seems to have put a lot of effort into making ""The Da Vinci Code"" a good movie.  Tom Hanks is perhaps the biggest surprise.  Even in the worst movies he's been in, he had managed to retain his charm and likeability.  However, he's so restrained here that he barely seems to react to anything, which makes his character fall shockingly, thuddingly flat.  Ian McKellan and Paul Bettany go the other way and overract their hearts out.  McKellan (obviously enjoying himself) is effective as always- the movie's more alive when he's on the screen.  Unfortunately, he doesn't show up until an hour into the movie, and he leaves again 20 minutes before the ending.  Bettany on the other hand is so petulant and crazed as to be unbelievable- his character is certainly creepy, but never all that compelling.  Tatou is another big surprise- the normally perky actress pretty much glowers her way through the entire movie, and she never bothers to develop any chemistry with Hanks (not like he's trying any harder).  You would think that with a cast like this acting would not be one of ""The Da Vinci Code""'s faults, but unfortunately it is.The movie really drags in its first half hour then finally picks up before dragging out its climax.  For a 150 minute movie to be so erratically paced is inexcusable.  Had ""The Da Vinci Code"" been a leaner and meaner 110 minutes, I might have enjoyed it more.  This finally brings me to the movie's controversy, as it attacks many of the tenants of Christianity.  The way it does this is pretty interesting- it takes known facts (how much of Christianity's tenants were decided at a single Council, the ambiguity of Mary Magdeline's role in Jesus' life) then spins speculation out of how the Church might be involved in a massive cover-up.  While some of the movie's claims are thought-provoking and interesting (especially the whole ""Last Supper"" bit), its ultimate conspiracy is far too fantastic to be taken seriously.  Everyone these days seems set on the idea that the Church hides conspiracies and murders to protect them (see ""Stigmata"" and ""End of Days"").  Though I'm no Catholic- or even a Christian, for that matter- I still don't think that this claim has any merit, or is even worth protesting movies over because it's so absurd.  Perhaps I'd be more willing to examine this claim if so many mediocre movies hadn't been made about it.""The Da Vinci Code"" is diverting, but I'm not happy I spent [...] to see it.  It's not as bad as its critical reception has suggested, but also not good enough to be worth arguing over.  When all the controversy is stripped away, it's a mediocre thriller that its ultra-talented director and cast didn't seem to put much effort into.

640038,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JOC9,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","Like tens of millions of other people, I read THE DA VINCI CODE to see what the hype was all about. As a book, THE DA VINCI CODE really isn't that great. The writing is not very tight, the dialogue is rather cheesy, and the characters have about as much personality as cardboard. The book is far inferior in both style and substance to its predecessor, ANGELS AND DEMONS. Despite these drawbacks, the book is a mega-bestseller and when a movie adaptation was announced, it had all the signatures to be a major blockbuster: Ron Howard was signed on to direct, Tom Hanks was signed to star with Ian McKellen signed as part of the supporting cast, and a huge budget (somewhere around $150-$200) to support the project. The movie was veiled in secrecy and no preview screenings were allowed. Most of the buzz was that it was going to be the must-see movie of the year.Yet, there was some other noise being made, too. There were those in the industry who were warning that there was so much secrecy not because of the controversy surrounding the film, but because the movie really wasn't all that great. The naysayers were right because THE DA VINCI CODE turned out to be nothing more than a lackluster film based on a less than lackluster novel.The film's plot basically follows the plot of the book. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a visiting professor of symbology visiting Paris. An art historian and curator at the Louvre is murdered and Langdon is implicated in the plot. His awareness of what's going on becomes aroused when a French agent, Sophie Neveu, explains to him that he's the one suspected of murder. The murdered man turns out to be her grandfather and he left messages that let Sophie know she has to help Langdon. They team up and begin a cross country midnight adventure that takes them from France to England and back to France again. Along the way, Langdon and Neveu are joined with the brilliant and handicapped Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) who reveals to Neveu the real cover-up that's going (that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children together).Tom Hanks is normally a brilliant actor whether doing drama or comedy. However, in THE DA VINCI CODE he seems subdued. I'm not sure if it's because Langdon isn't much of a character or if Hanks was just doing this movie for the paycheck, though it's probably a combination of the two. Ron Howard has become a great director, but whatever tricks he's learned making such films as APOLLO 13, A BEAUTIFUL MIND, and CINDERELLA MAN were totally thrown out the window with THE DA VINCI CODE because just about anyone who knows how to operate a digital camera could have made the same movie. The novel really isn't that a great of a book and the movie is even a worse movie. In fact, the only redeeming thing about the film is Ian McKellen.

If you went to the theater or rented the movie with a preconceived notion of how it would be offensive because your preacher or pastor or priest had already filled your head with thoughts of the inaccuracies of the film, then you were more likely to be offended by its content. It is sad when our society is so full of itself and so certain of its self-righteousness that something like this can be the catalyst of so much controversy. The story was well-told which is why it got the hackles up on so many backs of the religious fanatics, but take their narrow-mindedness and short-sightedness with a huge grain of salt because they are without doubt the spawn of insanity. The story does provide food for thought and if that scares you, then crawl back into your little hole and pout and scream profanity about the insult you feel.

640050,A1C80B497LCYKA,B00005JOC9,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[4, 18]","I couldn't finish Dan Brown's book: it was just too pedestrian. It reminded me of popular pulp fiction from the 1930's. Yes, it's very clever - clever enough to make him a lot of money. But it is poorly written in a skeletal sort of way - so void of fleshy detail that it reads like a movie script, which probably helped to convince Ron Howard that it would make a good movie. If Howard hadn't made a movie out of it, it probably would have been forgotten in five years or less, the way all fiction of this type is. Now, it could very well be remembered for ten.Mr. Brown has taken history with all its wonderful detail, disassembled and reconstructed it according to a fantastic plan to discount the Church and prove that Christ is not God. By redefining and reinterpreting everything that has happened in the past two thousand years - from events to symbols - Brown attempts to prove that Jesus married Mary Magdaline, and that she, not the chalice from the Last Supper, was the legendary Holy Grail. According to Brown, because they were married and had a child, the Church has spent the past twenty centuries persecuting women and killing off anyone that could prove the humanity of Christ, especially if they were one of his descendants. Thus, the stage is set for a fantastic mystery thriller.Director Ron Howard assembled the best cast and crew, the finest sets and locations, and everything else that money could buy in order to make this film live up to its namesake. He used many of the techniques he perfected in BEAUTIFUL MIND to recreate Brown's eerie tale of cover-up, secret societies, codes, treasure hunts, murder, and all the things that make good pulp fiction entertaining. His film is almost a page-by-page adaptation of Brown's novel. It's uncanny how true he was to it. As far as research and professionalism, Howard actually does his job far better than Brown.Unfortunately - or fortunately - the cast is drab, as are the sets and locations. The story itself gets so bogged down in all the explanations and revelations that, unless the viewer has read the book, he will probably be lost and confused. And when it's all over, the viewer is left with the feeling, ""So what?"" There is no satisfaction in learning Brown's thesis that Christ was just a man. When you've taken away the hope of the world, what else could you expect? Even from an entertainment standpoint, it is very unsatisfactory. There are a couple of suspenseful moments, but it isn't fun the way a real suspense thriller or murder mystery should be. There are just too many philosophical discussions and not nearly enough adrenaline pounding moments. There's not even a love story.To top it off, to anyone of faith, it's very disturbing. So, any way you look at it, except perhaps financial, the film's a flop - which makes me seriously doubt the rumors that they're planning a sequel. People may have watched the first one to discover what the hubbub was all about, but they won't make that mistake twice.What the book and movie do accomplish - other than making a lot of Christians mad - is to raise the question of how much facts and history can be changed to accommodate a story. After all, we're talking about fiction here. But this is light fiction that is playing with some serious facts and some monumental history; and not just any history: the history of the Church. More importantly, it is fiction that has changed Christ from being God to being just a man - so it's blasphemous fiction to boot. Three centuries ago, both Brown and Howard would have been hung, if not burned at the stake, for their ""light fiction.""Besides the blasphemy, what bothers me most is the fact that these works lack integrity. They don't respect anything or anyone. They casually misrepresent facts without any attempt at being accurate; but worse, they misrepresent the truth, without any attempt at being honest. Even a fiction writer has to be honest with his research in order to be believable. But this writer and director don't even make a pretense at it. And what's worse, most of their readers and viewers don't seem to care, which shows how far we've come in our own integrity.So, we have a book that is uninspired and pedestrian; a film that is dull and confusing; both of them without integrity, even blasphemous; and neither of them particularly entertaining, except on the most superficial level.

640063,A1FO4RPOIVAAX4,B00005JOC9,WyomingNomad,"[5, 11]","*****5 Stars: Storyline makes for a riveting read and therefore movie storyline. Ron Howard, Tom Hanks, et al deserve high marks for their work in the movie.Zero Stars: Beneath the great directing and acting is the enthralling Da Vinci Code storyline from Dan Brown's book. The story is a cunning, clever frontal assault on Christianity and Leonardo. Most of Dan Brown's ideas are suspiciously similar to ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" and ""The Templar Revelation."" Unfortunately, both books are based on myths and legends, not historical facts (from any field of study).Negative stars to Dan Brown for his claims, both spoken and written, that his novel -- from which the movie is based -- is factual and accurate.Point #1. Priory of Scion from 1099...false. Turns out it is a hoax created in 1956 by Pierre Plantard, a pretender to the French throne. Do a wikipedia search on Priory of Sion and find out for yourself.Point #2. Jesus married Mary Magdalene. There is not a single historical document that will back up this claim, although it can be found in fiction.Point #3. Leonardo was a Grand Master of Scion. Refer to point #1Point #4. Leonardo placed symbols in his art. Art historians disagree with the characterizations & supposed ""facts"" that Dan Brown offers -- again, there is no historical fact to support Mr. Brown's claims.Point #5. Jesus not divine until the 4th century. Again, it is good that Mr. Brown is not trying to make a living as a bibilical scholar or historian as he would be unable to find work. Jesus has consistently been recognized as divine since before his crucifixion, without interruption, up to the present.Point #6. 4 Gospels in New Testament were among 80 - others rejected by the church to protect the ""truth."" False. The 4 Gospels were without peers in the first century, written by those who knew Jesus Christ.Point #7. The Gnostic Gospels should have more weight than the 4 Gospels (Mathew, Mark, Luke & John). The Gnostic gospels came 150-200 years after Christ and were not likely written by those who the books were named after since those people -- Thomas, Mary Magdelene, Philip, et al -- had all been dead for generations at that point.Even as a work of fiction, Dan Brown's book is troubling. His agenda appears to be to take real people, real places, real pieces of art -- all particularly well known ones -- and methodically infusing distortions from myths, legends, and popular fiction. Mr. Brown's chutzpah in declaring his work as accurate and factual is deeply dishonest and clearly unethical. In fact, I am surprised that it is not illegal.This storyline is not problematic for those who will research the claims and seek truth through experts in art, history and literature. There is plenty available on the internet and via other Da Vinci Code offerings that are very effective in demolishing all -- yes, ALL -- of Dan Brown's claims.But for those that do not have time or desire to get to the bottom of things, they may be misled and Mr. Brown's work has the potential to cause harm to those that accept his version of ""facts"" and it may impact their faith in institutions, authority, lay organizations, Christianity and religion in general.This movie/storyline has the power to make pessimists out of good people.",5,New Genre?: Factional Distortionism,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,3267,"['*****5', 'Stars', 'Storyline', 'riveting', 'read', 'therefore', 'movie', 'storyline', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'et', 'al', 'deserve', 'high', 'marks', 'work', 'movie.Zero', 'great', 'directing', 'acting', 'enthralling', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'storyline', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'book', 'story', 'cunning', 'clever', 'frontal', 'assault', 'Christianity', 'Leonardo', 'Most', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'ideas', 'are', 'suspiciously', 'similar', 'Holy', 'Blood', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Templar', 'Revelation', 'Unfortunately', 'books', 'are', 'based', 'myths', 'legends', 'not', 'historical', 'facts', 'field', 'study', '.Negative', 'stars', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'claims', 'spoken', 'written', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'factual', 'accurate.Point', '1', 'Priory', 'Scion', '1099', 'false', 'out', 'hoax', 'created', '1956', 'Pierre', 'Plantard', 'pretender', 'French', 'throne', 'Do', 'wikipedia', 'search', 'Priory', 'Sion', 'find', 'out', 'yourself.Point', '2', 'Jesus', 'married', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'not', 'single', 'historical', 'document', 'will', 'back', 'up', 'claim', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'fiction.Point', '3', 'Leonardo', 'was', 'Grand', 'Master', 'Scion', 'Refer', 'point', '1Point', '4', 'Leonardo', 'placed', 'symbols', 'art', 'Art', 'disagree', 'characterizations', 'supposed', 'facts', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'offers', 'again', 'historical', 'fact', 'support', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'claims.Point', '5', 'Jesus', 'not', 'divine', '4th', 'century', 'Again', 'good', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'not', 'trying', 'make', 'living', 'bibilical', 'scholar', 'historian', 'would', 'be', 'unable', 'find', 'work', 'Jesus', 'consistently', 'been', 'recognized', 'divine', 'crucifixion', 'interruption', 'up', 'present.Point', '6', '4', 'Gospels', 'New', 'Testament', 'were', '80', 'others', 'rejected', 'church', 'protect', 'truth', 'False', '4', 'Gospels', 'were', 'peers', 'first', 'century', 'written', 'who', 'knew', 'Jesus', 'Christ.Point', '7', 'Gnostic', 'Gospels', 'should', 'have', 'more', 'weight', '4', 'Gospels', 'Mathew', 'Mark', 'Luke', 'John', 'Gnostic', 'gospels', 'came', '150-200', 'years', 'Christ', 'were', 'not', 'likely', 'written', 'who', 'books', 'were', 'named', 'people', 'Thomas', 'Mary', 'Magdelene', 'Philip', 'et', 'al', 'had', 'been', 'dead', 'generations', 'point.Even', 'work', 'fiction', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'book', 'troubling', 'agenda', 'be', 'take', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'places', 'real', 'pieces', 'art', 'particularly', 'well', 'known', 'ones', 'methodically', 'infusing', 'distortions', 'myths', 'legends', 'popular', 'fiction', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'chutzpah', 'declaring', 'work', 'accurate', 'factual', 'deeply', 'dishonest', 'clearly', 'unethical', 'fact', 'am', 'surprised', 'not', 'illegal.This', 'storyline', 'not', 'problematic', 'who', 'will', 'research', 'claims', 'seek', 'truth', 'experts', 'art', 'history', 'literature', 'plenty', 'available', 'internet', 'other', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'offerings', 'are', 'very', 'effective', 'demolishing', 'yes', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'claims.But', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'desire', 'get', 'bottom', 'things', 'may', 'be', 'misled', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'work', 'potential', 'cause', 'harm', 'accept', 'version', 'facts', 'may', 'impact', 'faith', 'institutions', 'authority', 'lay', 'organizations', 'Christianity', 'religion', 'general.This', 'movie/storyline', 'power', 'make', 'pessimists', 'good', 'people']",N/A

640065,A2YMFNXSPRVKEW,B00005JOC9,Z. Fu,"[3, 5]","I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  I considered it to be the top thriller of 2006.  However, I was disappointed by the book.  The following are a few reasons why the movie is better.  Bear in mind that I may be biased because I watched the movie first.  I had already formed my own idea of the story before reading it.  (Most reviewers who claim that the book is better may suffer from the opposite.)I thought that Book would provide more background information on the founding of Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and Merovigian bloodline.  What I got was superficial discussion on goddess worshipping and overdone sex rituals.  It made me grateful that the Church suppressed all that ages ago.Silas is the most sympathetic character in the movie.  His death is the stuff of tragedy.  I do not feel the same way about him in the book.  His death is practically ruined.  In the book, he and Bishop Aringarosa supposedly sustained heavy gun wounds.  Silas was able to bring Aringarosa to a London hospital, slipped out into a city park and died unnoticed.  Where were the hospital personnel?In contrary of what the book claims, Richard Wagner was not a freemason.  This bit of misinformation undermines my confidence in other esoteric theories expounded by the author.One crytex enhances mystery.  Two is overkill.The main reason that the movie is better than the book is:  The movie implicates the Catholic Church in the main plot of the theft of the Grail.  The book, on the other hand, lays the entire blame on one person, Leigh Teabing, who masterminded murders and extortion.  Bishop acted on his own interest, thus divesting the Church with any responsibilities.  But, what a Bishop of Opus Dei wanted with the Holy Grail?  The book says that he wanted to use it to gain influence with the Pope.  However, a Bishop of Opus Dei can hardly reveal the Grail without undermining his own position.  Considering the history of the Church, the movie plotline is only more appropriate and realistic.  I suspect that was Dan Brown's original intention.  He altered it to pass the censorship in publication, and readapted it in the subsequent movie version.",5,The movie is better,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,2141,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'considered', 'be', 'top', 'thriller', '2006', 'However', 'was', 'disappointed', 'book', 'following', 'are', 'few', 'reasons', 'why', 'movie', 'better', 'Bear', 'mind', 'may', 'be', 'biased', 'watched', 'movie', 'first', 'had', 'already', 'formed', 'own', 'idea', 'story', 'reading', 'Most', 'reviewers', 'who', 'claim', 'book', 'better', 'may', 'suffer', 'opposite', 'thought', 'Book', 'would', 'provide', 'more', 'background', 'information', 'founding', 'Priory', 'Sion', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'Merovigian', 'bloodline', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'superficial', 'discussion', 'goddess', 'worshipping', 'overdone', 'sex', 'rituals', 'made', 'grateful', 'Church', 'suppressed', 'ages', 'ago.Silas', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'movie', 'death', 'stuff', 'tragedy', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'book', 'death', 'practically', 'ruined', 'book', 'Bishop', 'Aringarosa', 'supposedly', 'sustained', 'heavy', 'gun', 'wounds', 'Silas', 'was', 'able', 'bring', 'Aringarosa', 'London', 'hospital', 'slipped', 'out', 'city', 'park', 'died', 'unnoticed', 'Where', 'were', 'hospital', 'personnel', 'contrary', 'what', 'book', 'claims', 'Richard', 'Wagner', 'was', 'not', 'freemason', 'bit', 'misinformation', 'undermines', 'confidence', 'other', 'esoteric', 'theories', 'expounded', 'author.One', 'crytex', 'mystery', 'Two', 'overkill.The', 'main', 'reason', 'movie', 'better', 'book', 'movie', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'main', 'plot', 'theft', 'Grail', 'book', 'other', 'hand', 'entire', 'blame', 'one', 'person', 'Leigh', 'Teabing', 'who', 'masterminded', 'murders', 'extortion', 'Bishop', 'acted', 'own', 'interest', 'thus', 'divesting', 'Church', 'responsibilities', 'what', 'Bishop', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'wanted', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'book', 'wanted', 'use', 'gain', 'influence', 'Pope', 'However', 'Bishop', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'can', 'hardly', 'reveal', 'Grail', 'undermining', 'own', 'position', 'Considering', 'history', 'Church', 'movie', 'plotline', 'only', 'more', 'appropriate', 'realistic', 'suspect', 'was', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'original', 'intention', 'altered', 'pass', 'censorship', 'publication', 'readapted', 'subsequent', 'movie', 'version']",N/A

Normally I am not into religious movies but this was not bad. If you are expecting a fast paced, action packed Indiana Jones treasure hunt kind of movie this probably is not the film for you but if you are looking for a suspenseful, dramatic and intellectual movie, give this one a try. It's visually beautiful and has great music. I liked the acting, liked the characters and loved the way it was filmed. I actually heard about the theories the book is based on years ago. As far as the religious meaning behind the movie or the debate of it's fact and fiction, I choose to remain neutral on the topic. I find it in poor taste when people preach about their religious beliefs in a review so I won't do that to anyone reading this. I choose instead to judge this movie on it's artistic value. It was an awesome work of art, had some great twists and turns, kept my attention and I would watch it again though I doubt I would buy it for my collection. This will never be an all-time favorite movie for me but it made me want to read the book and it was certainly worth watching!",4,Very interesting!,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,1189,"['was', 'pleasently', 'surprised', 'movie', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'seeing', 'movie', 'am', 'considering', 'Normally', 'am', 'not', 'religious', 'movies', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'are', 'expecting', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'packed', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'kind', 'movie', 'probably', 'not', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'suspenseful', 'dramatic', 'intellectual', 'movie', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'great', 'music', 'liked', 'acting', 'liked', 'characters', 'loved', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'actually', 'heard', 'theories', 'book', 'based', 'years', 'ago', 'As', 'far', 'religious', 'meaning', 'movie', 'debate', 'fact', 'fiction', 'choose', 'remain', 'neutral', 'topic', 'find', 'poor', 'taste', 'when', 'people', 'preach', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'anyone', 'reading', 'choose', 'instead', 'judge', 'movie', 'artistic', 'value', 'was', 'awesome', 'work', 'art', 'had', 'great', 'twists', 'turns', 'kept', 'attention', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'doubt', 'would', 'buy', 'collection', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movie', 'made', 'want', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
