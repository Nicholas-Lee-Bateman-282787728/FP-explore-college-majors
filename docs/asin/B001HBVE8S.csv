1199824,A1ZPKKWT79C6HW,B001HBVE8S,"APC Reviews ""APC Reviews""","[30, 46]","""Spain...On the Road Again"" answers the question that did not need to be asked: ""What if we made an ELEVEN (11) hour version of 'Sideways', except instead of having two guys driving around California wine country with two beautiful girls, one blonde and elegant one dark and lively, we instead had them drive around Spain?"" Oh, and what if instead of it being poignant, funny, endearing, touching and frequently hilarious it was instead self-indulgent, meandering, contrived, aimless and annoying? Oh, and rather than them driving around in a charming old Saab junker while eating and drinking in merely very nice restaurants and wineries they instead drove around in a $100,000 Mercedes convertible while eating in only the very best restaurants? And, oh yeah, another difference, they could also endlessly express vague, meandering opinions that, while displaying a lot of experience with wealthy celeb status consumption, were witless and consistently betrayed a Cliff Notes knowledge of the world around them.Gwyneth Paltrow is rather touching in a vague, beautiful soccer mom kind of way, although the voyeurism of getting to see her in ""real"" life wears thin after a short while, and Mario Batali is just being Mario. Claudia Bassols, the Catalan actress pulled in to give Paltrow a gal pal on the trip, is charming and bravely bears her thankless task of escorting Mark Bittman, the food and wine writer from the New York Times. Bittman, the major flaw in the ""casting"" of this magnum homage to shallow self importance, may have thought that he was channeling a toxic know it all version of Thomas Haden Church's character from ""Sideways"". But mostly he brings to mind Woody Allen's line from""Annie Hall"" when, trapped behind a pontificating self-anointed film ""expert"" while waiting on line he says ""What I wouldn't give for a large sock with horse manure in it!"" My feeling exactly. But instead all I had was the remote to turn off this interminable journey of wandering Hamptons-ites.Bittman embodies the sort of top of the food chain, know it all, been everywhere and eaten everything, toxic, New York foodie snob behavior that is so insufferable to those who have made their lives outside the realm of Manhattan and Long Island. To every simple joy embraced by others he brings the sulphur if his self regard and baseball card collection of past facts, travels  and meals. Whatever you are doing, whatever you are, whatever joy fills your life, it's just another catalog entry for Bittman. He is a one man de-joying machine, relating everything he encounters to other similar catalog entries in his collection of past snobistic experiences. The program could have featured just Mario, who we know can cook and has an at least entertaining ego, with Paltrow, who is lovely and kind of endearing in her not terribly bright but aristocratic self absorption, and cut the whole thing to ""just"" three hours, mostly of cooking and foods, and it would have been a decent program. As it is, you are being asked to be bear being trapped with these people on a VERY long vacation, from which there is only one escape, the eject button.",1,"As Woody Allen said: ""What I wouldn't give for a large sock with horse manure in it!""",1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,3136,"['Spain', 'Road', 'Again', 'question', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'asked', 'What', 'made', 'ELEVEN', '11', 'hour', 'version', ""'Sideways"", 'instead', 'having', 'two', 'guys', 'driving', 'around', 'California', 'wine', 'country', 'two', 'beautiful', 'girls', 'one', 'blonde', 'elegant', 'one', 'dark', 'lively', 'instead', 'had', 'drive', 'around', 'Spain', 'Oh', 'what', 'instead', 'being', 'poignant', 'funny', 'endearing', 'touching', 'frequently', 'hilarious', 'was', 'instead', 'self-indulgent', 'meandering', 'contrived', 'aimless', 'annoying', 'Oh', 'rather', 'driving', 'around', 'charming', 'old', 'Saab', 'junker', 'eating', 'drinking', 'merely', 'very', 'nice', 'restaurants', 'wineries', 'instead', 'drove', 'around', '100,000', 'Mercedes', 'convertible', 'eating', 'only', 'very', 'best', 'restaurants', 'oh', 'yeah', 'difference', 'could', 'also', 'endlessly', 'express', 'vague', 'meandering', 'opinions', 'displaying', 'lot', 'experience', 'wealthy', 'celeb', 'status', 'consumption', 'were', 'witless', 'consistently', 'betrayed', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'knowledge', 'world', 'them.Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'rather', 'touching', 'vague', 'beautiful', 'soccer', 'mom', 'kind', 'way', 'voyeurism', 'getting', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'wears', 'thin', 'short', 'while', 'Mario', 'Batali', 'just', 'being', 'Mario', 'Claudia', 'Bassols', 'Catalan', 'actress', 'pulled', 'give', 'Paltrow', 'gal', 'pal', 'trip', 'charming', 'bravely', 'thankless', 'task', 'escorting', 'Mark', 'Bittman', 'food', 'wine', 'writer', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'Bittman', 'major', 'flaw', 'casting', 'magnum', 'homage', 'shallow', 'importance', 'may', 'have', 'thought', 'was', 'channeling', 'toxic', 'know', 'version', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'character', 'Sideways', 'mostly', 'mind', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'line', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'when', 'trapped', 'pontificating', 'self-anointed', 'film', 'expert', 'waiting', 'line', 'What', 'would', ""n't"", 'give', 'large', 'sock', 'horse', 'manure', 'feeling', 'exactly', 'instead', 'had', 'was', 'remote', 'turn', 'off', 'interminable', 'journey', 'wandering', 'Hamptons-ites.Bittman', 'sort', 'top', 'food', 'chain', 'know', 'been', 'everywhere', 'eaten', 'everything', 'toxic', 'New', 'York', 'foodie', 'snob', 'behavior', 'so', 'insufferable', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'lives', 'realm', 'Manhattan', 'Long', 'Island', 'simple', 'joy', 'embraced', 'others', 'sulphur', 'self', 'regard', 'baseball', 'card', 'collection', 'past', 'facts', 'travels', 'meals', 'are', 'doing', 'are', 'joy', 'life', 'just', 'catalog', 'entry', 'Bittman', 'one', 'man', 'de-joying', 'machine', 'relating', 'everything', 'other', 'similar', 'catalog', 'entries', 'collection', 'past', 'snobistic', 'experiences', 'program', 'could', 'have', 'featured', 'just', 'Mario', 'who', 'know', 'can', 'cook', 'least', 'entertaining', 'ego', 'Paltrow', 'who', 'lovely', 'kind', 'endearing', 'not', 'terribly', 'bright', 'aristocratic', 'self', 'absorption', 'cut', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'three', 'hours', 'mostly', 'cooking', 'foods', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'program', 'are', 'being', 'asked', 'be', 'bear', 'being', 'trapped', 'people', 'VERY', 'long', 'vacation', 'only', 'one', 'escape', 'eject', 'button']",Spain...

1199825,A55MRYPUAX4QU,B001HBVE8S,Avid Reader,"[13, 21]","I am not sure if it is the players, the setting, the food (or all three) but this series resonated deeply.  It is, without a doubt, one of the best documentaries ever filmed, a masterwork of editing.  First and foremost is Mario - chef, critic, story teller, flirt and gadabout.  Gwyneth (""GP"") offers insight and humor as well as a good appetite. Mark, the reporter, is the perfect foil to Batali and Claudia is the gorgeous dressing on the salad.Two distinctive elements stand out:  First, they do more than run around gobbling food. They visit sites, investigate history and lore, talk culture and politics and religion AND - the perfect touch - family and kids.  Second, the fantastic meals are not at five star restaurants but in mountain shacks, on the beach, in a smoky underground cooker, over an open fire in a vineyard.  We are introduced to the cuisine of Spain in a unique and mouthwatering way.The humor is infectious, like when the gals go to the spa and the guys insist they are going to ""work out at the gym"".  Gwyneth thinks the idea is hilariously preposterous and swears she will run through the vineyard naked if they are exercising.  The camera switches from the girls to scenes of Mark and Mario eating, laughing, drinking at one establishment after another.  Both offer running commmentary on the food and the trip as the girls undergo beauty treatments.

1199826,AM9ZX2XCOGJ3G,B001HBVE8S,"Fernando Melendez ""fermed""","[13, 21]","Surely a good editor would have thrown out most of the material found in these four DVDs and produced a single disc that perhaps would have been passable; but there was no such editor, and thus we are presented with the interminable and repetitive vapidity of four narcissists who have the alleged intention of enlightening us about the food, the culture, and the beauty of Spain; that they would fail in their intention and neither entertain nor illuminate was predictable.Our guides through this misadventure are a rotund and generally disheveled Mario Batali, a restaurant owner in the States (defined as a celebrity chef); an actress, Gwyneth Paltrow, who does not eat meat unless it comes from a happy bird which has been (preferably) overcooked; Mark Bittman, who may or may not be contributing to the demise of the New York Times, his employer, and whose work includes a book ""How To Cook Everything"" (enough said); and a pretty and bubbly Spanish actress, Claudia Bassols, who competes with Paltrow for the emptiest of heads. All four are obsessed with themselves and little else. Claudia manages to walk about in a bikini while taking a shower, revealing that she is far more attractive when fully clothed; Mario demonstrates his incompetence with many things, including with his golf clubs. Claudia sings, with Mark, while traveling in La Mancha. Neither one should ever sing in public. In all, these four characters utter comments about the food and the passing scenery which are as trite and forgettable as they themselves seem.Some of the other reviewers who did not like this offering suggested ""Made in Spain"" with Jose Andres, as being a far better and more useful culinary tour of Spain. I agree and recommend it as an antidote to ""Spain...On The Road Again.""",1,A Disaster,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,1776,"['Surely', 'good', 'editor', 'would', 'have', 'thrown', 'out', 'most', 'material', 'found', 'four', 'DVDs', 'produced', 'single', 'disc', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'passable', 'was', 'such', 'editor', 'thus', 'are', 'presented', 'interminable', 'repetitive', 'vapidity', 'four', 'narcissists', 'who', 'have', 'alleged', 'intention', 'enlightening', 'food', 'culture', 'beauty', 'Spain', 'would', 'fail', 'intention', 'entertain', 'illuminate', 'was', 'predictable.Our', 'guides', 'misadventure', 'are', 'rotund', 'generally', 'disheveled', 'Mario', 'Batali', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'States', 'defined', 'celebrity', 'chef', 'actress', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'who', 'not', 'eat', 'meat', 'happy', 'bird', 'been', 'preferably', 'overcooked', 'Mark', 'Bittman', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'contributing', 'demise', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'employer', 'work', 'book', 'How', 'Cook', 'Everything', 'enough', 'said', 'pretty', 'bubbly', 'Spanish', 'actress', 'Claudia', 'Bassols', 'who', 'Paltrow', 'emptiest', 'heads', 'four', 'are', 'obsessed', 'little', 'else', 'Claudia', 'walk', 'bikini', 'taking', 'shower', 'revealing', 'far', 'more', 'attractive', 'when', 'fully', 'clothed', 'Mario', 'incompetence', 'many', 'things', 'including', 'golf', 'clubs', 'Claudia', 'sings', 'Mark', 'traveling', 'La', 'Mancha', 'one', 'should', 'ever', 'sing', 'public', 'four', 'characters', 'utter', 'comments', 'food', 'passing', 'scenery', 'are', 'trite', 'forgettable', 'seem.Some', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'offering', 'suggested', 'Made', 'Spain', 'Jose', 'Andres', 'being', 'far', 'better', 'more', 'useful', 'culinary', 'tour', 'Spain', 'agree', 'recommend', 'antidote', 'Spain', 'Road', 'Again']",Spain...

1199828,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001HBVE8S,mirasreviews,"[3, 5]","I hate reality TV, travelogues put me to sleep, and I can only take cooking shows in small doses, but I love ""Spain...on the Road Again"". In this case, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This is a thirteen-part travelogue/food series that aired on PBS in fall of 2009. Chef and restaurateur Mario Batali, who lived in Spain for several years, provides the sparse narration for a food-oriented road trip through 10 regions of Spain in the company of four famous personalities. Batali is joined by friends Mark Bittman, the New York Times food writer, and Gwyneth Paltrow, the actress. The charming and beautifully-accented Spanish actress Claudia Bassols rounds out the quartet and acts as a translator when the Spanish of the American's isn't up to the task.Batali has an overbearing personality, but the mixing and (not always) matching of these four people is interesting enough. Often Batali is paired with Paltrow and Bittman with Bassols, but they switch around. Every person is not there for every episode, as Gwyneth Paltrow goes off to be with her family in London or Bittman is off on a book tour. A lot of conversations of dubious significance take place in the Mercedes convertibles that they tool around in, but this gives the audience lots of opportunity to see the countryside. And we do see both rural and urban Spain, touching on every region except the southwestern part of the country. The intrepid travelers take us to where the food is grown, raised, or caught, as well as to the restaurants in which it is served.We see a lot of the country by car. Though the hosts draw our attention to points of interest, and they get out of the cars and go in some museums, cathedrals, resorts, etc., these are more like teasers than tours of the sights. They offer a lot more detail about the food. We visit expensive trendy restaurants as well as more traditional establishments that look accessible to middle-class budgets. We watch specialty cheesemakers, pastry chefs, and country cooks do their thing. Our hosts make lobster stew with some fishermen on the beach of Menoa. The food really runs the gamut. And it literally made my mouth water every time. Spain offers perhaps the best Mediterranean cuisine at this time, and nothing could be a better advertisement for Spanish tourism.That's what ""Spain...on the Road Again"" is. It's an ad for Spain. And apparently for Mercedes, given the number of times we see those cars. It couldn't be more effective or enjoyable. The odd combination of personalities, the lovely scenery, stunning architecture, and food, food, food. Great food, even for a semi-vegetarian like Paltrow. (Like me, she eats seafood but not other meat.) I'd hop on a plane to Spain right now if I could afford to. Some of the dishes could be made at home, some couldn't. Sometimes they are explained, but not in the case of restaurant food. If you've seen Mark Bittman's ""The Best Recipes in the World"" series, the format of the food segments is similar. It's just thoroughly enjoyable. This is an hour-long show, but I am always surprised that it ends so soon.",5,Mouth-Watering and Thoroughly Enjoyable Reality/Travelogue/Food Show.,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,3106,"['hate', 'reality', 'TV', 'travelogues', 'put', 'sleep', 'can', 'only', 'take', 'cooking', 'shows', 'small', 'doses', 'love', 'Spain', 'Road', 'Again', 'case', 'whole', 'greater', 'sum', 'parts', 'thirteen-part', 'travelogue/food', 'series', 'aired', 'PBS', 'fall', '2009', 'Chef', 'restaurateur', 'Mario', 'Batali', 'who', 'lived', 'Spain', 'several', 'years', 'sparse', 'narration', 'food-oriented', 'road', 'trip', '10', 'regions', 'Spain', 'company', 'four', 'famous', 'personalities', 'Batali', 'joined', 'friends', 'Mark', 'Bittman', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'food', 'writer', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'actress', 'charming', 'beautifully-accented', 'Spanish', 'actress', 'Claudia', 'Bassols', 'out', 'quartet', 'translator', 'when', 'Spanish', 'American', ""n't"", 'up', 'task.Batali', 'overbearing', 'personality', 'mixing', 'not', 'always', 'matching', 'four', 'people', 'interesting', 'enough', 'Often', 'Batali', 'paired', 'Paltrow', 'Bittman', 'Bassols', 'switch', 'around', 'Every', 'person', 'not', 'there', 'episode', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'be', 'family', 'London', 'Bittman', 'off', 'book', 'tour', 'lot', 'conversations', 'dubious', 'significance', 'take', 'place', 'Mercedes', 'convertibles', 'tool', 'around', 'audience', 'lots', 'opportunity', 'see', 'countryside', 'do', 'see', 'rural', 'urban', 'Spain', 'touching', 'region', 'southwestern', 'part', 'country', 'intrepid', 'travelers', 'take', 'where', 'food', 'grown', 'raised', 'caught', 'as', 'well', 'restaurants', 'served.We', 'see', 'lot', 'country', 'car', 'hosts', 'draw', 'attention', 'points', 'interest', 'get', 'cars', 'go', 'museums', 'cathedrals', 'resorts', 'etc.', 'are', 'more', 'teasers', 'tours', 'sights', 'offer', 'lot', 'more', 'detail', 'food', 'visit', 'expensive', 'trendy', 'restaurants', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'traditional', 'establishments', 'look', 'accessible', 'middle-class', 'budgets', 'watch', 'specialty', 'cheesemakers', 'pastry', 'chefs', 'country', 'cooks', 'do', 'thing', 'hosts', 'make', 'lobster', 'stew', 'fishermen', 'beach', 'Menoa', 'food', 'really', 'gamut', 'literally', 'made', 'mouth', 'water', 'time', 'Spain', 'perhaps', 'best', 'Mediterranean', 'cuisine', 'time', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'advertisement', 'Spanish', 'tourism.That', 'what', 'Spain', 'Road', 'Again', 'ad', 'Spain', 'apparently', 'Mercedes', 'given', 'number', 'times', 'see', 'cars', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'effective', 'enjoyable', 'odd', 'combination', 'personalities', 'lovely', 'scenery', 'stunning', 'architecture', 'food', 'food', 'food', 'Great', 'food', 'even', 'semi-vegetarian', 'Paltrow', 'seafood', 'not', 'other', 'meat', ""'d"", 'hop', 'plane', 'Spain', 'right', 'now', 'could', 'afford', 'dishes', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'home', 'could', ""n't"", 'Sometimes', 'are', 'explained', 'not', 'case', 'restaurant', 'food', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mark', 'Bittman', 'Best', 'Recipes', 'World', 'series', 'format', 'food', 'segments', 'similar', 'just', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'hour-long', 'show', 'am', 'always', 'surprised', 'so', 'soon']",Spain...

The same for those looking for a travel show. To me this is a just a road trip with four folks I can identify with taking in the sights, foods, and culture of Spain.Mario is the phat philosopher (phat in the Vietnamese sense meaning ""hot, cool, tempting or attractive"" OK, maybe in the other sense too) He continuously wears ugly orange crocks, carries an oversize orange ""man purse"" but proves quite knowlegable on Spanish history as well as cuisine.  He seems to appreciate the down home kitchens as well as starred establishments.Mark Bittman or Bitty as they call him on the show seems to love life, women and eating.  I've not read his books or columns before but have become a fan of his ascerbic outlook on the culinary scene.Paltrow,the non meat eater has an attitude of ""I'm concerned about the plight of animals and don't accept factory farms"" while being able to eat and drink with a panache usually reserved for carnivores.  She doesn't come off snooty about her food choices.And Bassols: that lady can eat!  And Laugh!
