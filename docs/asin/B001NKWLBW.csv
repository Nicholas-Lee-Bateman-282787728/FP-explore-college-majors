People familiar with Ellison's work and those that are outright fans will enjoy this spotty but engaging review of his works, featuring his trademark rants and pet peeves.  For anyone else it may be hard going since we hear a lot about his undoubted talent as a writer,  but don't see much of it on display.  We do get a couple short dramatic &#34;readings&#34; from his works that showcase his abilities as performer.",3,Do You Know Harlan Ellison?

1220171,A1Q6PG0Y3XZL7M,B001NKWLBW,"Book & Music thief, from HI","[0, 0]","I bet many of you (especially those born after 1980), probably are not as familiar, as you should be, with the name Harlan Ellison - you might have heard that he had written the teleplay, for what many consider to be the single finest episode of Classic Star Trek, from the first season titled:  'City on the Edge of Forever' (voted as Best, in many ST fan polls), or you might have seen his name listed as a 'story consultant/ advisor' on the series 'Babylon Five' - but you probably don't know that he is certainly, one of the most brilliant & imaginative writers associated with the Science Fiction (preferred term 'Speculative Fiction') New wave, from about the mid-late sixties onward (also including Robert Silverberg, Michael Moorcock from England, Philip K. Dick, and others).  His inherent rebelliousness, and constant striving for 'integrity' with regards to preserving an artist/ author's original vision, put him at odds with Hollywood producers (even though he had great early success there with the aforementioned Star Trek, and many other highly acclaimed episodes of other futuristic/ speculative series, especially the exceptionally fine, and incredibly original (for their time) Outer Limits Episodes:  'Demon with a Glass Hand' and 'Soldier').  As I also mentioned in an earlier review of the Rod Serling 'Night Gallery' series, I was either too young, or not even born when these Classic series were first-run (but have seen them subsequently in re-runs, or on DVD - and am amazed at both the high quality of script writing, and even more so by the sheer imaginative power behind them)!  Ellison came back to Hollywood (briefly) in the mid-1980's to re-launch the 'Twilight Zone' (the show of course, originally created by Rod Serling - so their paths did eventually cross, so to speak).  Ellison created/ wrote the new 1980's version parameters/ guidelines, i.e. show 'bible' and was integral to its successful (at least initially) re-launch, and even wrote a number of the best first-season episodes (but alas, another controversy, over a writer's original story 'integrity' caused him to resign, mid-way = I think the show lost a lot of its momentum, and originality after that).  note:  the mid-1970s film, 'A Boy and His Dog' (about after-effects of devastating Nuclear War), was also based on an award winning Ellison story - I think a follow-up has also been done, in 'Graphic novel' form.But the bulk of Harlan Ellison's genius, has been exhibited thru his brilliant & masterful book writing (mostly his incredibly imaginative & insightful short stories, that have won numerous prestigious awards), and also by way of his ground-breaking work as an editor/ producer of the watershed speculative story anthologies (that broke much new ground, at the time): 'Dangerous Visions'  'Again,Dangerous Visions' and perpetually 'in the works' D-Visions 3??  He has also produced, very fine critique/commentary on popular culture, Movies, and television.  But, most unfortunately, for many years, much of his certified 'genius' was out-of-print.  But Thankfully, much of it is now available again (I ordered a bunch, from Amazon, in the last few years - the publisher is Ellison's own 'Edgeworks-Abbey' imprint).  But if you are currently unfamiliar, watch this DVD first = it will be a good initial guide, to Harlan Ellison's Best Works (did I mention his good friend, comic-genius Robin Williams is also heavily featured on this DVD?)

Love him or hate him you have to admit that Harlan Ellison is always entertaining, a heck of a good storyteller and an angry driver.  The only complaint I have is that the DVD is much to short.  Its all very well to hear about the author's childhood but I was much more interested in his career as an author.  That's not to say that what is here is not excellent far from it you get Ellison opinion on politics, copyright infringement, writers, television, the general dumbing down of entertainment and a host of other issues.  It was also hilarious that the only one that seemed to care about Ellison being Jewish was Robin Williams.The DVD extras are also not to missed especially the melodramatic way in which Ellison reads his stories.

1220177,A2T0V99GLGXWCM,B001NKWLBW,Ghost(Ghost(M)),"[4, 9]","I've always disdained the sci-fi genre as subliterary vvankery by and for dorks. However, this guy's name kept constantly popping up somehow, and so I decided to check out what it's all about by ordering a couple of books of his, and finding this documentary in the red-envelope company's catalogue.The flick's not that great: first, it's near completely substance free: too much time is given to numerous people of renown (like Robin Williams, for example) eulogising Mr Ellison. A bit or two, strategically placed, could serve a purpose, but presented in overwhelming quantities and w/o noticeable tie-in with something more substantial, it only takes time and annoys.There was actually very little about Ellison's life, other than some generalities. The guy himself is present but mostly bloviating; he makes a negative impression as a sort of over-confident and rebarbative, loud old Yid who is constantly angry about god only knows what. Looks like he's having some sort of ""childhood issues"" -- or simply is posturing for the sakes of ""trademark"" public persona (he's trademarked his own name, btw., so he's obviously not above self-promotion). He's very self-satisfied about his ""progressive"" credentials, ""marching"" with MLK in Montgomery, Alabama back in the day, etc. Wonder if he and his friends will march again, today, in places like Detroit, Chicago, North Philadelphia, Baltimore, DC, etc. (you get the point). The state of affairs that can be observed in these localities is the direct result of his and his ilk's ""marching"" around Montomery back then; you'd think at least something like a sense of ambiguity would at last be visited upon these do-gooders, but no (of course), safely ensconced in his exclusive compound high in the mountains (rather than Trenton, NJ), he's still unqualifiedly proud of his past and so on.He is, apparently, also proud of being a technological retard: he types his stuff on a typewriter (still, even now) and he types with two fingers. Then he has a long bitching session about his editors' pressing him a bit to meet their deadlines. Gee, well, no wonder he's a little slow, right? I mean, with two fingers on a mechanical machine; all edits done physically, with a pencil on paper; then full retype (with two fingers on a typewriter). He's very proud of it -- but WHY? Why would one be proud of being a cretin? Anyway... I'll try his books: maybe it'll be better, but based purely on this flick, I didn't like this guy. He acts all butthurt about how he was frequently roughed up as a child in school -- I'll tell you! If his personality back then was anything like it seems to be today (and he seems to suggest that indeed it was), I can understand why he got beat up all the time! I'd kick him today myself, to be honest.All in all, the film is fluffy, vapid, and hagiographical; despite trying, it does not present the guy in positive light... in fact, it does not present the guy much at all: it is simply uninformative. There are some extras, where Ellison reads some excerpts from his pieces (uh... OK), and a couple of vapid ""interviews"" (more like forced and flaccid bull sessions, while eating pizza with guys like Gaiman; these are vapid in the extreme, mumble-mumble, munch-munch, pauuuuuuse... all about nothing).The bottom line: mildly annoying tripe, full of unjustified encomia and largely devoid of solid info. Not well made. Three stars -- barely earned.----------------Note 1: Got the books, skimmed around: typical (for the genre) flatulent bilge, exactly as I remembered. So, no, the books didn't do anything for me either.

Some people hate him, some people love him. Regardless, you get to see what a prolific writer he is and some of the ""younger"" writers and people of Hollywood and publishing reflect on their time with the man. The question is whether his created persona (of a bigger than life obnoxious character) has confined him to a cell in which he can't change his personality. There are a number of old and new interviews showing Ellison's value system that life is a constant fight. In some ways you feel sorry for the guy but in other ways maybe you agree.

Harlan also reads several passages from his most famous stories.What can I say? If you're a fan, this is what you've been waiting for.

1220182,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001NKWLBW,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[16, 18]","Dreams with Sharp Teeth (Erik Nelson, 2007)One of the cardinal rules to making a successful documentary is to get yourself an interesting subject, and, at least to me, one of the most interesting subjects on the planet is the caustic, seemingly misanthropic, politically incorrect, and deeply, deeply funny writer Harlan Ellison, some of whose stories have become iconic in American letters (""I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream"", ""Shatterday"", and ""'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktock Man"", one of the most anthologized stories in American history, are all Ellison works). As well as one of America's foremost writers of science fiction, Ellison has written some classic television episodes, hundreds of political essays, and, well, lord knows what else. The man's pretty much done everything.This documentary ranges from footage of television interviews from the sixties, seventies, and eighties, footage of talks and book signings, a clip of Ellison accepting the Grandmaster title from the Fantasy and Science Fiction Writers' Association, interviews with friends and colleagues of Ellison's (including Neil Gaiman, Robin Williams, and many others), and interview footage with Ellison. All of it is fascinating, and a great deal of the reason is that Ellison is fascinating. It's not just that he's more than willing to air his cantankerousness to as wide an audience as possible, but also that Ellison is a born storyteller (since 1955, the man has published thousands of pieces). He knows how to make even the mundane interesting. Not that anything related to Harlan Ellison is mundane.While the documentary is of obvious interest to Ellison fans (and, really, we should all be Ellison fans), I think that even those people who have never read a word that man has written would get a great deal of enjoyment out of this just because of how much fun Harlan Ellison is. (And after you're done, go find a copy of ""I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream"", and read it.

The initial thrust of the DVD notes  is to give me the idear he was reading whole stories, not five or six lines/ paragraphs.Could have been longer.I have to cull the enthusiasm I felt because the notes and the information are slightly misleading. The Interview was Neil Gainman is fun and rambling.Ellison  attacking fans and fandom is funny. The stories which are too bizarre to place here were in a prolonged essay called ""Xenogeneses"", though Harlan the Ellison forgets (right, perfect memory) to mention his involvement at a con where he dropped bags of water onto people from his hotel windows and removed doors from select rooms. The crap needs to call the pot dark.But, folks interested in Ellison will find enough here to amuse, and maybehaps go off and locate some of his other recordings and tapes and CD's and his books to entertain themselves.

1220184,A1TR9417Z4U72F,B001NKWLBW,"S. M. Robare ""smurfwreck""","[7, 8]","I didn't discover Ellison's work until after high school.  I was working a dead-end job on the night shift at a grocery store and one of the other stockers, a slightly odd and intriguing woman, shoved a copy of Shatterday into my hands and told me to read it.  It was the start of two wonderful friendships, one which has lasted through the rest of my life to this point.  Even after tracking down and reading the bulk of Ellison's work, he still manages to amaze me with his wit, charm, cantankerousness, and his wildly amazing perspective on short form storytelling.  Ellison is a master at plucking those moments, those essential truths and shared yearnings that we all face, and putting them into a world of nightmares and dreamscapes that's both fantastic and brutally real.  I've been lucky enough to meet the man once and managed to mostly escape his razor sharp tongue, and even for all of his autobio writings, I still feel like I have a lot to learn about the man.Erik Nelson's portrait documentary, Dreams with Sharp Teeth, goes a long way to filling in some of the gaps.  Nelson does a pretty darn good job of weaving together Ellison's story through anecdotal interviews with his contemporaries and friends, archival interviews and other video footage (including some rare home movies from Ellison's personal collection), as well as some deftly chosen passages from various short stories performed by the man himself.My one complaint is that the documentary shies away from really covering Ellison's life as a whole, and instead focuses on his influence within his peer group and his overall ""angry old Jew"" personality.  It ends up feeling like a special feature of a great Ellison documentary, which has yet to be made, which is kind of a shame.  That isn't to say that it isn't worth the time, it very much is, it's just whetted my appetite for more.  Think I'm going to go back and crack open my copy ofShatterday.Also, a quick note on the Pizza with Harlan and Neil Gaiman featurette.  the sound quality on this segment is pretty awful, with Gaiman's half of the conversation at a mouse's whisper and Ellison's chomping on his slice like crackling thunder.",4,He has a mouth and boy does he scream...,1245888000,"06 25, 2009",2009,2174,"['did', ""n't"", 'discover', 'Ellison', 'work', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'working', 'dead-end', 'job', 'night', 'shift', 'grocery', 'store', 'one', 'other', 'stockers', 'slightly', 'odd', 'intriguing', 'woman', 'shoved', 'copy', 'Shatterday', 'hands', 'told', 'read', 'was', 'start', 'two', 'wonderful', 'friendships', 'one', 'lasted', 'rest', 'life', 'point', 'Even', 'tracking', 'down', 'reading', 'bulk', 'Ellison', 'work', 'still', 'amaze', 'wit', 'charm', 'cantankerousness', 'wildly', 'amazing', 'perspective', 'short', 'form', 'storytelling', 'Ellison', 'master', 'plucking', 'moments', 'essential', 'truths', 'shared', 'yearnings', 'face', 'putting', 'world', 'nightmares', 'fantastic', 'brutally', 'real', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lucky', 'enough', 'meet', 'man', 'once', 'managed', 'mostly', 'escape', 'razor', 'sharp', 'tongue', 'even', 'autobio', 'writings', 'still', 'feel', 'have', 'lot', 'learn', 'man.Erik', 'Nelson', 'portrait', 'documentary', 'Dreams', 'Sharp', 'Teeth', 'long', 'way', 'filling', 'gaps', 'Nelson', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'job', 'weaving', 'together', 'Ellison', 'story', 'anecdotal', 'interviews', 'contemporaries', 'friends', 'archival', 'interviews', 'other', 'video', 'footage', 'including', 'rare', 'home', 'movies', 'Ellison', 'personal', 'collection', 'as', 'well', 'deftly', 'chosen', 'passages', 'various', 'short', 'stories', 'performed', 'man', 'one', 'complaint', 'documentary', 'shies', 'away', 'really', 'covering', 'Ellison', 'life', 'whole', 'instead', 'focuses', 'influence', 'peer', 'group', 'overall', 'angry', 'old', 'Jew', 'personality', 'up', 'feeling', 'special', 'feature', 'great', 'Ellison', 'documentary', 'yet', 'be', 'made', 'kind', 'shame', ""n't"", 'say', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'very', 'much', 'just', 'whetted', 'appetite', 'more', 'Think', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'back', 'crack', 'open', 'copy', 'ofShatterday.Also', 'quick', 'note', 'Pizza', 'Harlan', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'featurette', 'sound', 'quality', 'segment', 'pretty', 'awful', 'Gaiman', 'half', 'conversation', 'mouse', 'whisper', 'Ellison', 'chomping', 'slice', 'crackling', 'thunder']",Harlan Ellison: Dreams with Sharp Teeth
1220185,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B001NKWLBW,stoic,"[3, 4]","Dreams with Sharp Teeth is a documentary about science fiction author Harlan Ellison.Ellison is a lightning rod - by turns he is brilliant, pompous, vulnerable, aggressive, eloquent, crass, etc. He is a prolific and influential writer and has won many awards. Ellison can also be engaging. Dreams shows Ellison lecturing at universities; he has complete mastery of the audience. On the other hand, Ellison has an abrasive personality that helps account for his five marriages and his involvement in many lawsuits. The end result is a larger-than-life persona.At times, Ellison lets the mask slip. When Ellison discusses his deceased parents and his upbringing in Ohio, the viewer senses that it is the ""real"" Harlan, not the alter ego. Harlan says that he was the one kid from his hometown who ""made it""; in the next breath, he admits that it has not made him happy.Ellison describes himself by quoting Hunter S. Thompson. (He knew  ""...the dead-end loneliness of a man who makes his own rules""). There are a lot of parallels between Ellison and Thompson. Each writer succeeded, in part, by creating a confrontational, larger-than-life persona. But each was later confined by that persona, unable to grow.There are a few dead spots in Dreams. Ellison's scenes with Robin Williams show two celebrities admiring each other while saying nothing of consequence.I saw Dreams several days ago and I'm still mulling over the film. Viewers emerge from Dreams with ambivalent feelings about Ellison, but the film is provocative.
