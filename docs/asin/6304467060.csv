Gridlock'd had a great anti-bureaucracy plot and was well acted by three wonderful actors, Thandie Newton, Tim Roth, and the late great Tupac Shakur.

424364,A1FS9R0JXHLHEG,6304467060,George Annessa,"[2, 2]","With a decent plot and very little in the way of action, it is amazing that this film works so effectively. Basically a day-in-the-life tale following the misfortunes of two drug addicts, Spoon (Tim Roth) and Stretch (Tupac Shakur) as they desperately try to kick heroin habits and avoid the unfortunate attention of a local gangster.The dialogue is quick and funny, and the two leads are very impressive. Shakur is a true revelation and Roth does his usual swaggy/cool style even with his character's boundaries. The film tries to be moral at times, but due to the comedy - just isn't. With a great soundtrack and a live performance at the end from the rapper himself, Gridlock'd succeeds magnificently.",4,Fun And Entertaining - Tupac &amp; Tim Roth Play It Well.,1090195200,"07 19, 2004",2004,704,"['decent', 'plot', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'action', 'amazing', 'film', 'so', 'effectively', 'Basically', 'day-in-the-life', 'tale', 'following', 'misfortunes', 'two', 'drug', 'addicts', 'Spoon', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Stretch', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'desperately', 'try', 'kick', 'heroin', 'habits', 'avoid', 'unfortunate', 'attention', 'local', 'gangster.The', 'dialogue', 'quick', 'funny', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'very', 'impressive', 'Shakur', 'true', 'revelation', 'Roth', 'usual', 'swaggy/cool', 'style', 'even', 'character', 'boundaries', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'moral', 'times', 'due', 'comedy', 'just', ""n't"", 'great', 'soundtrack', 'live', 'performance', 'end', 'rapper', 'Gridlock', ""'d"", 'magnificently']",Gridlock'd VHS

424368,A19BR7XJJ3NOLU,6304467060,Ryan Norton,"[4, 4]","This was a movie that I hadn't previously heard of but saw the cover on another website and thought I would check into it.  I came to Amazon and purchased GridLock'd on a whim and I have to say that this was an AMAZING movie for the price.  Tupac and Tim Roth both play Heroin Addicts living in Detroit Michigan during the mid 1990's.  They desperately want to get clean after their friend ""Cookie"" overdoses on her first shot of heroin.  However, they both soon discover just how hard it can be to work the system.  After running around town all day long trying to get ""Temporary Medicaid"" cards they finally discover that there isn't such a thing.  The comedic element in this movie is quite pleasing even though it is not the type of movie that will have you rolling on the floor laughing.  The movie is a perfect mix between seriousness and comedy.  If you are a true fan of Tupac and you want to own a classic than please do not hesitate to pick this one up.  Tupac Shakur's performance in this movie is absolutely stunning.  After watching this movie, you will begin to understand that Tupac was not only the greatest rapper to ever live, but was also becoming a very fine talent in Hollywood that most certainly would have flourished had he not been taken from us the way he was.  It is definitely worth the price and I can promise you that you will not find this one at your local Walmart.
