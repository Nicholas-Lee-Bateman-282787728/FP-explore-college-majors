1333168,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0038RSIQ0,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE DISAPPEARED (writ., prod., dir. Johnny Kevorkian, 2008, 97 minutes) is a silly horror story that somehow kept me watching to the end. It's really because I'm a sucker for cute English actors. Oh ... do not be confused by the dozen other films with this title ... why does that not surprise me?Poor young Matt Ryan (Harry Treadaway,City of Ember, see my review) and his father Jake (Greg Wise) are suffering badly from the disappearance of Matt's little brother Tom (Lewis Palmer). Matt's best friend Simon (Tom Felton) is something of a minor comfort but then his sister is abducted. It is feared Tom has also been abducted.Since doing too many drugs and losing his little brother landed Matt in the nut house, he is obligated to do follow-up visits at the hospital and is pestered by his care worker Adrian Ballan (Alex Jennings). However, it seems all this is a build-up to the obvious: Matt sees and hears dead people.There are too many pointless, frankly stupid horror films like this with the kidnapping-serial killer-psychic routine, and I do not think England is the place for them to be trying at this waste of a genre. Unlike the beautiful novelVintage: A Ghost Story(by my friend Steve Berman, see my review, and I think THE DISAPPEARED is a rip-off of that by the way) this story has nothing to offer, no lesson, not even decent entertainment. Oh, it made me jump once and I take my hat off to them for that.A few things to keep you on the alert, in case you STILL want to see this: the accents are thick, the sound is horrific and as with so many British productions there are lots of mumbled, swallowed lines. There's a huge debate as to whether the soundtrack contains a goof with Harry Treadaway calling Tom Felton ""Tom"" instead of ""Simon"" - but I found it is no goof, since the missing little brother's name is Tom and the dialogue is in reference to him.Still, I had to have subtitles on and I thought my good ears could cut through any English muck. Not this time!The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (English subtitled)(the original, see my review) has a lot more to offer in this area though none of it is for the faint of heart. Clint Eastwood's brilliantHereafter(see my review) is yet another excellent film roughly in this vein that I can recommend. DISAPPEARED is one I'll just skip recommending, if you please.In any case, I can't tell if this is another example of those working vacations the British love so much - work in a cheap cruddy movie when theater is thin, and vice-versa. However, there is a strange promise at the end of the film that this will be a continuing story. If Harry Treadaway stays as adorable as he still is now, he may yet become a major star. But first, he really needs to learn how to act! The one who shines in my opinion is Tom Felton, who has a subtle sweetness and natural air to his acting. He's great here, I just love him and hope to see his career take off rightly.The question is, what's the point and who cares?? - anyway, I calls 'em as I sees 'em. I just KNOW I'm going to get slammed for this review ....",2,"Birth pains of a psychic medium, or I sees dead people all over Britain",1340064000,"06 19, 2012",2012,3070,"['DISAPPEARED', 'writ.', 'prod.', 'dir', 'Johnny', 'Kevorkian', '2008', '97', 'minutes', 'silly', 'horror', 'story', 'somehow', 'kept', 'watching', 'end', 'really', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'cute', 'English', 'actors', 'Oh', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'dozen', 'other', 'films', 'title', 'why', 'not', 'surprise', 'Poor', 'young', 'Matt', 'Ryan', 'Harry', 'Treadaway', 'City', 'Ember', 'see', 'review', 'father', 'Jake', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'are', 'suffering', 'badly', 'disappearance', 'Matt', 'little', 'brother', 'Tom', 'Lewis', 'Palmer', 'Matt', 'best', 'friend', 'Simon', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'something', 'minor', 'comfort', 'then', 'sister', 'abducted', 'feared', 'Tom', 'also', 'been', 'abducted.Since', 'doing', 'too', 'many', 'drugs', 'losing', 'little', 'brother', 'landed', 'Matt', 'nut', 'house', 'obligated', 'do', 'follow-up', 'visits', 'hospital', 'pestered', 'care', 'worker', 'Adrian', 'Ballan', 'Alex', 'Jennings', 'However', 'build-up', 'obvious', 'Matt', 'sees', 'hears', 'dead', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'pointless', 'frankly', 'stupid', 'horror', 'films', 'kidnapping-serial', 'killer-psychic', 'routine', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'England', 'place', 'be', 'trying', 'waste', 'genre', 'beautiful', 'novelVintage', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'friend', 'Steve', 'Berman', 'see', 'review', 'think', 'DISAPPEARED', 'rip-off', 'way', 'story', 'nothing', 'offer', 'lesson', 'not', 'even', 'decent', 'entertainment', 'Oh', 'made', 'jump', 'once', 'take', 'hat', 'that.A', 'few', 'things', 'keep', 'alert', 'case', 'STILL', 'want', 'see', 'accents', 'are', 'thick', 'sound', 'horrific', 'so', 'many', 'British', 'productions', 'are', 'lots', 'mumbled', 'swallowed', 'lines', 'huge', 'debate', 'soundtrack', 'goof', 'Harry', 'Treadaway', 'calling', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'Tom', 'instead', 'Simon', 'found', 'goof', 'missing', 'little', 'brother', 'name', 'Tom', 'dialogue', 'reference', 'him.Still', 'had', 'have', 'subtitles', 'thought', 'good', 'ears', 'could', 'cut', 'English', 'muck', 'Not', 'time', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'English', 'subtitled', 'original', 'see', 'review', 'lot', 'more', 'offer', 'area', 'none', 'faint', 'heart', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'brilliantHereafter', 'see', 'review', 'yet', 'excellent', 'film', 'roughly', 'vein', 'can', 'recommend', 'DISAPPEARED', 'one', ""'ll"", 'just', 'skip', 'recommending', 'please.In', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'example', 'working', 'vacations', 'British', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'work', 'cheap', 'cruddy', 'movie', 'when', 'theater', 'thin', 'vice-versa', 'However', 'strange', 'promise', 'end', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'continuing', 'story', 'Harry', 'Treadaway', 'as', 'adorable', 'still', 'now', 'may', 'yet', 'become', 'major', 'star', 'first', 'really', 'learn', 'how', 'act', 'one', 'who', 'opinion', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'who', 'subtle', 'sweetness', 'natural', 'air', 'acting', 'great', 'here', 'just', 'love', 'hope', 'see', 'career', 'take', 'off', 'rightly.The', 'question', 'what', 'point', 'who', 'anyway', 'calls', 'sees', 'just', 'KNOW', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'slammed', 'review']",N/A
1333169,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0038RSIQ0,Eric Sanberg,"[2, 5]","This plot line in movies is not new so, if you're going to tackle it, you need to bring something new to the table and that isn't happening here.In a nutshell: A teenage boy spends some time in an asylum because of the angst he feels due to the fact that his neglect led to his younger brother's kidnapping and probable murder. Now he's back home and he starts hearing and seeing strange things which lead him to believe his dead brother is trying to tell him something.I'm not certain why they bothered with this. It's been done before and been done better. This is one of the slower 97 minutes you'll ever spend with a movie. The script needed some real tightening up. It meanders way too much. As it is essentially a murder mystery (even with its other-worldly underpinnings) it needed to stay on the mark. Here, you get the usual ""is he nuts or are these things really happening to him"" ploy yet he takes too long to get on the stick and start figuring things out. Other things (like his problems with the local toughs) add nothing to the offerings but time. They have no integral part to the story. And the story behind his friend Amy becomes apparent pretty early on so most viewers should get that right away.I simply cannot recommend bothering with this.

1333170,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B0038RSIQ0,Haunted Flower,"[5, 6]","""The Disappeared"" was written by Johnny Kevorkian and Neil Murphy and directed by Kevorkian. Matthew Ryan (Harry Treadaway) is returning home from being in a ""looney bin"" for some time after the disappearance of his younger brother which he feels responsible for. Matthew hasn't given up trying to find out what happened to his brother and has begun to see and hear the ghost of Tom trying to send him a message about the disappearances that have been going on.This was a very thrilling psychological horror story that unfolds very gradually and picks up momentum as it progresses. Some twists are decipherable from the beginning but one in particular is very surprising. What is fascinating is that the older brother keeps hearing and seeing things that the camera shows aren't there for others to see so throughout it begs the question whether the ghost is real or if it is all in Matthew's head.Harry Treadaway as Matthew has to bounce back and forth from being somewhat numb as an after effect of the drugs he has been on to a determination to solve this mystery once and for all. He doesn't know how to trust with what he has been hearing and seeing because everything still thinks he is crazy. Treadaway is deep in the throes of anguish over the loss of his sibling and captures the mental instability mixed with fear well while on this journey.Matthew befriends a girl next door, Amy (Ros Leeming) who has her own problems but believes his story and tries to help him out. This is Leeming's debut film performance which is a surprise because not only does she master the role well, but she is pretty in a captivating way with cascades of super long light blond hair. Amy brings a dash of hope and potential for romance.Matthew's best friend, Simon (Tom Felton) will appear familiar since we've been watching him grow up for years in the Harry Potter series as Draco Malfoy. Simon was with Matthew having a party for him when little brother, Tom went off to the playground and never came back. Simon is glad Matthew is back from treatment but can't help ribbing him for it and does not believe his stories...until Simon's own sister goes missing too. Tom Felton does an excellent job as Simon of trying to be the friend Matthew needs, but has to draw a line when he feels his friend is losing his marbles once more. Felton leaves most of Malfoy behind here but still does a bit of the sniveling panic when attacked.Matthew's father, Jake Ryan (Greg Wise) is having a hard time dealing with the loss of one son and the mental problems of the other. He tries to put on a brave face but since he secretly blames Matthew for everything, it is difficult to remain civil. It also doesn't help that Jake is an alcoholic prone to fits of rage that made him a suspect for the disappearance. Greg Wise's performance is subtle most of the time as the quiet drunk, but fully commits to pulling back his fist when his temper gets the best of him to unleash the inner turmoil beneath.The haunting score was a perfect fit to this film and the running themes are beautiful and cold. Again, the step-by-step accumulation of mystery ultimately came to a surprising conclusion. There are some questions remaining about the extent to the realism or supernatural qualities of the ""evil among us"" and how long it has been around, but for the most part this was a solid film and I would recommend checking it out!Bonus FeaturesThere is a making of the film featurette has a running time of about sixteen minutes and covers talking to each of the main actors about their experience working on the film, the psychology of their characters, and their positive opinions of the director and each other. The post-production featurette is of similar length and focuses on the crew's perspective in terms of editing and how they enjoyed the type of horror story this was being psychological instead of bloody. They talk about the added crows and the sound scoring which is a haunting benefit to the film.There is also the Anatomy of a Horror Film eight minute featurette where the cast and crew debate whether the ghost exists or is just in Matthew's imagination and how startling his appearances are in the film. It is revealed that the church set is the same as the 1970's Stephen King horror film ""Salem's Lot"". There is also a moment pointed out where they changed a character's eye color that was so quick, I didn't even notice it the first time. Also the actor who played Matthew insisted upon really getting buried alive for his nightmare sequences!",4,A very thrilling psychological horror story that even has Harry Potter's Malfoy in it,1274918400,"05 27, 2010",2010,4531,"['Disappeared', 'was', 'written', 'Johnny', 'Kevorkian', 'Neil', 'Murphy', 'directed', 'Kevorkian', 'Matthew', 'Ryan', 'Harry', 'Treadaway', 'returning', 'home', 'being', 'looney', 'bin', 'time', 'disappearance', 'younger', 'brother', 'responsible', 'Matthew', ""n't"", 'given', 'up', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'brother', 'begun', 'see', 'hear', 'ghost', 'Tom', 'trying', 'send', 'message', 'disappearances', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'on.This', 'was', 'very', 'thrilling', 'psychological', 'horror', 'story', 'very', 'gradually', 'up', 'momentum', 'twists', 'are', 'decipherable', 'beginning', 'one', 'particular', 'very', 'surprising', 'What', 'fascinating', 'older', 'brother', 'keeps', 'hearing', 'seeing', 'things', 'camera', 'shows', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'others', 'see', 'so', 'question', 'ghost', 'real', 'Matthew', 'head.Harry', 'Treadaway', 'Matthew', 'bounce', 'back', 'forth', 'being', 'somewhat', 'numb', 'effect', 'drugs', 'been', 'determination', 'solve', 'mystery', 'once', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'trust', 'what', 'been', 'hearing', 'seeing', 'everything', 'still', 'crazy', 'Treadaway', 'deep', 'throes', 'anguish', 'loss', 'sibling', 'mental', 'instability', 'mixed', 'fear', 'well', 'journey.Matthew', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'Amy', 'Ros', 'Leeming', 'who', 'own', 'problems', 'story', 'tries', 'help', 'out', 'Leeming', 'debut', 'film', 'performance', 'surprise', 'not', 'only', 'master', 'role', 'well', 'pretty', 'captivating', 'way', 'cascades', 'super', 'long', 'light', 'blond', 'hair', 'Amy', 'dash', 'hope', 'potential', 'romance.Matthew', 'best', 'friend', 'Simon', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'will', 'appear', 'familiar', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'grow', 'up', 'years', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'Draco', 'Malfoy', 'Simon', 'was', 'Matthew', 'having', 'party', 'when', 'little', 'brother', 'Tom', 'went', 'playground', 'never', 'came', 'back', 'Simon', 'glad', 'Matthew', 'back', 'treatment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'ribbing', 'not', 'believe', 'stories', 'Simon', 'own', 'sister', 'missing', 'too', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'excellent', 'job', 'Simon', 'trying', 'be', 'friend', 'Matthew', 'draw', 'line', 'when', 'friend', 'losing', 'marbles', 'once', 'more', 'Felton', 'most', 'Malfoy', 'here', 'still', 'bit', 'sniveling', 'panic', 'when', 'attacked.Matthew', 'father', 'Jake', 'Ryan', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'dealing', 'loss', 'one', 'son', 'mental', 'problems', 'other', 'put', 'brave', 'face', 'secretly', 'Matthew', 'everything', 'difficult', 'remain', 'civil', 'also', ""n't"", 'help', 'Jake', 'alcoholic', 'prone', 'fits', 'rage', 'made', 'suspect', 'disappearance', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'performance', 'subtle', 'most', 'time', 'quiet', 'drunk', 'fully', 'commits', 'pulling', 'back', 'fist', 'when', 'temper', 'best', 'unleash', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'beneath.The', 'haunting', 'score', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'film', 'running', 'themes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'cold', 'Again', 'step-by-step', 'accumulation', 'mystery', 'ultimately', 'came', 'surprising', 'conclusion', 'are', 'questions', 'remaining', 'extent', 'realism', 'supernatural', 'qualities', 'evil', 'how', 'long', 'been', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'solid', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', 'Bonus', 'FeaturesThere', 'making', 'film', 'featurette', 'running', 'time', 'sixteen', 'minutes', 'covers', 'talking', 'main', 'actors', 'experience', 'working', 'film', 'psychology', 'characters', 'positive', 'opinions', 'director', 'other', 'post-production', 'featurette', 'similar', 'length', 'crew', 'perspective', 'terms', 'editing', 'how', 'enjoyed', 'type', 'horror', 'story', 'was', 'being', 'psychological', 'instead', 'bloody', 'talk', 'added', 'crows', 'sound', 'scoring', 'haunting', 'benefit', 'film.There', 'also', 'Anatomy', 'Horror', 'Film', 'eight', 'minute', 'featurette', 'where', 'cast', 'crew', 'debate', 'ghost', 'just', 'Matthew', 'imagination', 'how', 'startling', 'appearances', 'are', 'film', 'revealed', 'church', 'set', 'same', '1970', 'Stephen', 'King', 'horror', 'film', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'also', 'moment', 'pointed', 'out', 'where', 'changed', 'character', 'eye', 'color', 'was', 'so', 'quick', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'first', 'time', 'Also', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Matthew', 'insisted', 'really', 'getting', 'buried', 'alive', 'nightmare', 'sequences']",N/A

1333175,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0038RSIQ0,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","The Disappeared quite ingeniously tries to blend the Sixth Sense with a murder mystery, but first time Writer/Director, Johnny Kavorkian, takes a big chance by adding a surprise ending, that just destroys anything the film had going for it. When Matt Ryan's (Harry Treadway) little brother disappears, he loses his mind. Upon returning to his home, he starts hearing and seeing his missing brother. Matt feels his brother his trying to tell him something and decides to follow the clues. The story here was actually pretty good, but the film moves at an absolute snails pace, felling well longer than 96 minutes. This is one of those films where they put everything on the surprise ending and save all the good stuff for the lead into it. The problem is that the surprise ending was lame and didn't make a whole lot of sense. There is a lot of symbolism in this film that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but the ending really just brings it all to a head. British actor, Harry Treadway is the lead and he was really amazing. Treadway manages to mix the depression associated with his brother's disappearance, the feeling that he's losing his mind, and the drive of a man on a mission, resulting in a great performance in an otherwise dull film. The Disappeared had a lot of potential and a unique story, but it moves so slowly that most people will lose interest well before it falls apart at the end.",2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,1404,"['Disappeared', 'quite', 'ingeniously', 'blend', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'murder', 'mystery', 'first', 'time', 'Writer/Director', 'Johnny', 'Kavorkian', 'big', 'chance', 'adding', 'surprise', 'ending', 'just', 'anything', 'film', 'had', 'going', 'When', 'Matt', 'Ryan', 'Harry', 'Treadway', 'brother', 'disappears', 'mind', 'returning', 'home', 'hearing', 'seeing', 'missing', 'brother', 'Matt', 'brother', 'trying', 'tell', 'something', 'decides', 'follow', 'clues', 'story', 'here', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'moves', 'absolute', 'snails', 'pace', 'felling', 'well', 'longer', '96', 'minutes', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'put', 'everything', 'surprise', 'ending', 'save', 'good', 'stuff', 'lead', 'problem', 'surprise', 'ending', 'was', 'lame', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'whole', 'lot', 'sense', 'lot', 'symbolism', 'film', ""n't"", 'make', 'whole', 'lot', 'sense', 'ending', 'really', 'just', 'brings', 'head', 'British', 'actor', 'Harry', 'Treadway', 'lead', 'was', 'really', 'amazing', 'Treadway', 'mix', 'depression', 'associated', 'brother', 'disappearance', 'feeling', 'losing', 'mind', 'drive', 'man', 'mission', 'resulting', 'great', 'performance', 'otherwise', 'dull', 'film', 'Disappeared', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'unique', 'story', 'so', 'slowly', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'lose', 'interest', 'well', 'apart', 'end']",N/A
