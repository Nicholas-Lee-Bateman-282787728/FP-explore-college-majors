6355,A2NGDGCB1EKZ6F,0767802616,"""2r45""","[1, 3]","This is not a particularly good film despite how awesome the plot sounds.  It involves a heartbroken Bridget Fonda befriending and becoming remates with Jennifer Jason Leigh, who becomes jealous when Bridget decides to get  married and move out.  Of course we can all relate to the jealous freind  part and have likely had simular experiences....but who wants to see a  movie about it.  However, I have to take my hat off to the makers of this  film because despite how boring the subject matter was becoming the film  managed to keep the audiences' attention through a multitude of racy  scenes.  In the beginning we see Bridget Fonda in the Buff walking around  pointlessly...later on Jennifer Jason Leigh joins in with some buff of her  own in about several different scene.  In addition there are many other  raunchy scenes that are designed to keep the audiences attention and they  work well.  So all in all I would recommend this film.",4,Keeps Your Attention,945129600,"12 14, 1999",1999,942,"['not', 'particularly', 'good', 'film', 'how', 'awesome', 'plot', 'heartbroken', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'befriending', 'becoming', 'remates', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'who', 'jealous', 'when', 'Bridget', 'get', 'married', 'move', 'out', 'course', 'can', 'relate', 'jealous', 'freind', 'part', 'have', 'likely', 'had', 'simular', 'experiences', '.but', 'who', 'see', 'movie', 'However', 'have', 'take', 'hat', 'makers', 'film', 'how', 'boring', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'becoming', 'film', 'managed', 'keep', 'audiences', 'attention', 'multitude', 'racy', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'see', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'Buff', 'walking', 'around', 'pointlessly', 'later', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'buff', 'own', 'several', 'different', 'scene', 'addition', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'raunchy', 'scenes', 'are', 'designed', 'keep', 'audiences', 'attention', 'work', 'well', 'So', 'all', 'would', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A

6358,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767802616,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I'm not going to sit here and lie and say that `Single White Female' is a good movie.  It is a complete and total hot mess of a film and all the naysayers are legitimately correct in calling this out for being a campy disaster of a film on most all accounts.  That being said, it is a lot of fun and works thoroughly in doing what it tries to do.  Like, I really liked this while I watched it, and then when it was over I realized how dumb the whole thing was.The film basically set a precedent for other cheap genre flicks that wanted to capitalize on the horrific idea that someone could become so obsessed with a person that they try and take over their lives; literally.  Allison Jones puts out an ad for a roommate after she breaks things off with her boyfriend only to find Hedra Carlson, a timid young woman who has nothing but room in her heart for all things Allison.  The two become friends, but it's obvious that Hedra takes their relationship far more seriously.  As they get to know each other more, Hedra becomes more and more controlling and desperate and soon the poo hits the fan and Hedra goes all sorts of bat-poop crazy.Jennifer Jason Leigh is an actress I don't get.  I mean, the world seems to adore her, but quite frankly I've never been really all that compelled by anything she's done.  I can always see her working the character in her head and ultimately pulling off the same performance; one that is dull and completely affected.  That wasn't the case here.  I absolutely LOVED everything about this performance.  She completely nailed the mental decline and layered her character's `crazy' with enough subtlety so as to make her creep up on us just as much as she crept up on Allison.  I also have to give credit to Barbet Schroeder for directing this film perfectly.  He received an Oscar nomination two years prior for deliver similarly tense scenes in a vastly different genre (I'm talking about `Reversal of Fortune') and he does just as well here, even when the film itself dives off the deep end in that final act.  He maintains the film's intensity and keeps the audience glued.Hate it all you want, but admire it for what it is.  This film is fun and it knows how to deliver some major goods.

I didn't really understand fully what that meant until I saw the movie. Now, yeah...it makes sense. I am sure almost everybody has a horror story or two about living with roommates. I had a couple in the past. One, during the first semester of my freshman year, who kept copying everything of me including clothes, the type of a girl I had, and how I did things, ended up tanking his last month of the semester by staying up until 6 A.M. constantly. Therefore, my grades went downhill because I couldn't sleep with the lights on. So, I lost over 15 pounds because of him. The other roommate many years later had a temper tantrum, but I left a lot early before it went full-blown which landed him in the slammer. So, yeah...having roommates sucks. Single White Female is the perfect quintessential picture about the dreadful feeling at the prospect of living with other people. I am so surprised that neither Jennifer Jason Leigh nor Bridget Fonda was nominated for their performances. Each of them is by far the best of their careers. Another surprise is that there are no sequels with possible names like Single Black Male, Single Asian Female, and, worst yet, Double Amputee Male.

She also shows a lot of skin in this movie, something else she likes to do in her films.Fonda's character, ""Allie Jones,"" is no Mary Poppins, either, or should I say Fonda isn't exactly Shirley Temple. The movie shows several scenes of her having sex with her boyfriend.The movie starts building its suspense about halfway through when Leigh - the roommate and admirer of Fonda - begins to lose her girlfriend to that guy....and decides to do something about it.There really isn't a lot of violence in this movie, mainly just at the end.

6367,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0767802616,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 10]","This horror thriller directed by Barbet Schroeder is fairly tightly wound with some interesting psychology around an apartment and a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is the mousy, dykey new roommate (and such a beauty she used to be! almost a clone of Elisabeth Shue) interested in Bridget Fonda and Steven Weber (Fonda's semi-cheating fianc&eacute;).  What we have is women's sex/fear fantasy and titillation with the obligatory ""all men are dogs"" theme thoroughly worked in.  Leigh actually says ""men are pigs,"" which amounts to the same thing, although I guess we could say women are pigs and men are dogs and call it even.There's some male titillation as well, of course, but Schroeder is primarily interested in spilling blood and out-dyking the dykes. Fonda is kind of cute and sexy, which is why I was able to watch the whole thing.  She is, by the way, another one of those children of a star, like Liza Minelli, who would never but never have made it except for the family's stardom, yet achieved a certain appeal through hard work, minimal talent, and a certain audaciousness. She can be striking in a stark, animalistic sort of way.  In some sense, her performance here anticipates her role as an America la femme Nikita in Point of No Return (1993) which came out the following year.Single White Female was considered a controversial sensation when it was released in the early nineties because of the gross sex and violence displayed, but I suspect future generations will see it as high camp and laugh out loud at how it panders to some of our baser instincts.  The knock-down, drag-out, blood-flying fight between Leigh and Fonda near the end can be seen as hilarious in its absurdity, and kind of campish as a burlesque of Hollywood's increasingly desperate appeal to blood lust in order to sell tickets.

Once I got over my expectations, and accepted that this was in fact a semi-horror film, I was okay, but it took some time to adjust my brain to that concept.That being said, Bridget Fonda does a good job as vulnerable little Allie, which makes the story believable. Of course she believes Hedy's story and finds it difficult to accept the lies once they become apparent. That's the kind of person she is and by the time she's wise to Hedy, it's almost too late.

It's Headra ""Hedy"" (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to the rescue!Allie thinks she found the best thing since sliced bread in Hedy.

And Allie soon finds out that Heady has some dark secrets.When Sam comes back from a business trip Hedy goes to his hotel posing as Allie (she cut and colored her hair the same color and style) to perform oral sex on him.

They are oposite as night and day. Alison is a successful business woman with great poise, a sophisticted wardrobe and haircut, and seemingly a well-rounded individual who is afraid of being by herself and is still hung up on her old love. Heddy is a mysterious stranger who rolls into her life, seemingly the helpful and compassionate friend. As it turns out she is anything but and little bits of information is thrown in through the POV of Alison. Slowly this is discovered, which leads ot a pretty interesting (and somewhat unsettling) revelation about the roomate in questions. We learn what she learns as she learns in for the most part. However, we did end up seeing some shots through Heddy's eyes alone, and are left knowing something Alison does not yet. This, of course, makes us more on the edge of our seat, wondering when, if, and how she will discover all of these secrets. And of course we wonder what the hell Heddy is really all about and how the movie will end.It begins well, pretty erotic and with a revelation that turns Alison's love life completely upside down and inside out. We then see a fleshing out of all characters involved, become intrigued by the two main leading ladies, and enjoy some nice drama and cruelty here and there. How would YOU react if the person you're rooming with suddenly starts taking over your life?Heddy is well-rounded out; we see her dark side, her sexual side, her sweet side. In some ways we feel bad for her and other ways we hate her. The deaths are made up to be that when they hit, they affect us. We learn to care about the characters or else how their deaths will impact other characters. Kudos to the director Barbet Schroeder for working this out and tugging on the heartstrings throughout.Some nice flashbacks on the side of Heddy that confused the audience would have been a nice addition I think. Unfortunitely those scenes are not in there and we go without.The dark moody colors and setting throughout the script lend to the role, adding more morbidity.This is more than just a drama - there is violence, death, sex, mystery, great setup, interesting extra tidbits on the side, and an awesome climax that leaves one biting their nail down to the thumb.All in all a nice recommendable flick - not unpredictable or very original but still interesting.",3,Dark and gritty,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,2640,"['Bridget', 'Fonda', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'star', 'serious', 'morbid', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'fears', 'being', 'alone.Recently', 'parting', 'fiance', 'Alison', 'Jones', 'advertises', 'roomate', 'Heddy', 'seemingly', 'ideal', 'partner', 'tainted', 'past', 'full', 'lies', 'madness', 'morbid', 'sexuality', 'only', 'hinted', 'are', 'oposite', 'night', 'day', 'Alison', 'successful', 'business', 'woman', 'great', 'poise', 'sophisticted', 'wardrobe', 'haircut', 'seemingly', 'well-rounded', 'individual', 'who', 'afraid', 'being', 'herself', 'still', 'hung', 'up', 'old', 'love', 'Heddy', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'who', 'life', 'seemingly', 'helpful', 'compassionate', 'friend', 'out', 'anything', 'little', 'bits', 'information', 'thrown', 'POV', 'Alison', 'Slowly', 'discovered', 'ot', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'unsettling', 'revelation', 'roomate', 'questions', 'learn', 'what', 'most', 'part', 'However', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'seeing', 'shots', 'Heddy', 'eyes', 'alone', 'are', 'left', 'knowing', 'something', 'Alison', 'not', 'yet', 'course', 'more', 'edge', 'seat', 'wondering', 'when', 'how', 'will', 'discover', 'secrets', 'course', 'wonder', 'what', 'hell', 'Heddy', 'really', 'how', 'movie', 'will', 'end.It', 'begins', 'well', 'pretty', 'erotic', 'revelation', 'Alison', 'love', 'life', 'completely', 'upside', 'down', 'inside', 'out', 'then', 'see', 'fleshing', 'characters', 'involved', 'become', 'intrigued', 'two', 'main', 'leading', 'ladies', 'enjoy', 'nice', 'drama', 'cruelty', 'here', 'there', 'How', 'would', 'YOU', 'react', 'person', ""'re"", 'rooming', 'suddenly', 'starts', 'taking', 'life', 'Heddy', 'well-rounded', 'see', 'dark', 'side', 'sexual', 'side', 'sweet', 'side', 'ways', 'feel', 'bad', 'other', 'ways', 'hate', 'deaths', 'are', 'made', 'up', 'be', 'when', 'hit', 'affect', 'learn', 'care', 'characters', 'else', 'how', 'deaths', 'will', 'impact', 'other', 'characters', 'Kudos', 'director', 'Barbet', 'Schroeder', 'working', 'out', 'tugging', 'heartstrings', 'throughout.Some', 'nice', 'flashbacks', 'side', 'Heddy', 'confused', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'addition', 'think', 'Unfortunitely', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'there', 'go', 'without.The', 'dark', 'moody', 'colors', 'setting', 'script', 'lend', 'role', 'adding', 'more', 'morbidity.This', 'more', 'just', 'drama', 'violence', 'death', 'sex', 'mystery', 'great', 'setup', 'interesting', 'extra', 'tidbits', 'side', 'awesome', 'climax', 'one', 'biting', 'nail', 'thumb.All', 'nice', 'recommendable', 'flick', 'not', 'unpredictable', 'very', 'original', 'still', 'interesting']",N/A

Her career as a fashion designer is  taking off and she shares a spacious, rent controlled apartment with her boyfriend Sam (Steven Weber). Allie tells him that he is the best thing that ever happened to her. Her perfect world is shattered one night by a wake up call from Sam's ex wife. It turns out that Sam is still sleeping with her and hiding it from Allie. Devastated she breaks up with him and kicks him out of their apartment. The next day she begins the search of finding a replacement roommate. She interviews a half dozen women but finds them all to be a little odd. None of the other candidates had anything on what comes walking through Allie's door next. Her name is Hedra (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and even though she is attractive she is painfully shy whereas Allie is more outgoing. Allie feeling a little bad for Hedra rips up all the other applications and offers this mystery woman the apartment on the spot. She tells her how she came to be looking for a new roommate and Hedra cautiously asks if there is a chance that Allie might patch things up with Sam causing her to be left all alone and in need of a new place to stay. Allie assures her that that isn't going to happen and the two women get settled in. Things start off innocently enough with the two women moving in furniture and admiring each other's jewels and antiques. Allie starts to notice little things about Hedra  that cause her to become concerned. Hedra is always nervous and on edge whenever Allie is in her room and she confides to Allie that her twin sister died during birth. Things start to get weirder when she notices that Hedra is copying her wardrobe and even gets a makeover complete with a hair cut that makes her look identical to Allie. Sam finally contacts Allie after several failed attempts and Allie is disturbed to hear that Sam has called numerous  times and even sent Allie letters which she never knew about. Suspecting Hedra of intercepting them she goes into her room and discovers why Hedra is so nervous whenever Allie is alone in her room. She finds tons of incriminating evidence that reveals that Hedra is definitely not who she says she is and  has been lying to Allie the whole time. The film is pretty suspenseful and darkly humorous. Both Fonda and Leigh give great performances with Leigh having more to work with.

First she picks up Fonda's mannerisms, then starts to borrow her wardrobe, cuts her hair to resemble Fonda's, and even &#34;borrows&#34; her roomie's boyfriend(Steven Weber) for a deceitful night of lovemaking.By that point Fonda's totally freaking out (wouldn't you?), and, well, that's when the whole thing gets a little too silly. Still, this is a nifty little shocker, and director Barbet Schroeder brings more intelligence and style to the material than it really deserves. Add that to the fine performances by the battling roommates and you've got a movie that will make you think twice before inviting total strangers to live with you.From there on, things simply continue to go from bad to worse when Allie's new roommate wants to borrow a few things-like her clothes, her boyfriend and her life.This suspense flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 19 going on 20 years old in my Sophomore year in college when it was theatrically released in the Summer of 1992 when George Bush, Sr. was president & we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1992-1993.",3,The Roommate From Hell,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,1638,"['SINGLE', 'WHITE', 'FEMALE', 'highly', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'unfortunate', 'young', 'woman', 'psychological', 'breakdown', 'glossy', 'slasher', 'movie', 'starring', 'two', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'young', 'actresses', 'maybe', 'same', 'time', 'perhaps', 'clever', 'well-acted', 'thriller', 'first', 'hour', 'resorting', 'routine', 'shocks', 'cheap', 'horror', 'flick.However', 'look', 'denying', 'dynamite', 'showcase', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'roommate', 'hell', 'who', 'bane', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'existence', 'First', 'up', 'Fonda', 'mannerisms', 'then', 'borrow', 'wardrobe', 'hair', 'resemble', 'Fonda', 'even', '34', 'borrows', '34', 'roomie', 'boyfriend', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'deceitful', 'night', 'lovemaking.By', 'point', 'Fonda', 'totally', 'freaking', 'out', 'would', ""n't"", 'well', 'when', 'whole', 'thing', 'little', 'too', 'silly', 'Still', 'nifty', 'little', 'shocker', 'director', 'Barbet', 'Schroeder', 'more', 'intelligence', 'style', 'material', 'really', 'Add', 'fine', 'performances', 'battling', 'roommates', ""'ve"", 'got', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'inviting', 'total', 'strangers', 'live', 'you.From', 'there', 'things', 'simply', 'continue', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'when', 'Allie', 'new', 'roommate', 'borrow', 'few', 'things-like', 'clothes', 'boyfriend', 'life.This', 'suspense', 'flick', 'back', 'memory', 'lane', 'when', 'was', '19', 'going', '20', 'years', 'old', 'Sophomore', 'year', 'college', 'when', 'was', 'theatrically', 'released', 'Summer', '1992', 'when', 'George', 'Bush', 'Sr.', 'was', 'president', 'had', 'budget', 'cuts', 'going', 'recession', 'had', 'back', '1992-1993']",N/A

Alley, the Leigh character, suffers from severe mental issues unbeknownst to the Bridget Fonda character. The problems Alley has becomes evident not only when she shows possession to her new roomate, but also at the point where Alley wants to take over her friend's life. A hugely suspenceful thriller that will leave you sitting on the edge of your seat. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays one of the best villins ever in the history of films in this piece and the writing and direction is impeccable.

Although most of the action and dialogue seems kind of cheesy now, I'm sure it was surprising and intriguing at the time.Jennifer Jason Leigh really creates a psychologically frightening character that definitely increases the scare factor of the situation overall. Her character is scary to think about and very well developed in her portrayal of psychoses.The amount of nudity and sexuality involved in this movie is kind of amazing. Every 10 minutes either Jennifer Jason Leigh or Bridget Fonda is getting out of the shower and walking naked across the apartment, or there's an extended sex scene between Bridget Fonda and her fiance. We can either say that the premise of stolen identity crosses into the most secure areas of our lives, like our sexuality, and that we are naked before these terrors... or we could just say that sex sells thrillers when plots are lacking.Either way, Single White Female is obviously from the 90s and the clothing is the most obvious reminder of that, although Fonda's haircut is a dead giveaway too.The DVD doesn't have any special features, except for a theatrical trailer, so that's kind of disappointing.
