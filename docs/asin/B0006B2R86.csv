Both protect a community of Mormons (who act like Amish) who do not believe in violence.Trinity is lot like Eastwood/Blondie inThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly, with a certain James Bond charm. He is not the usual brash gunman, but is twice and tough, and twice as sweet. A great character.In the spaghetti western tradition, mimicking ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" this film has all Italian cast. The dubbing didn't cut it, as it seemed imposed on the movie more than it was integrated.I'd like to see the series remade. It is that much fun.I recommend ""They Call Me Trinity.""

864852,A11L5M4MJP00UW,B0006B2R86,"David L Hutchins ""Music Lover""","[1, 5]","Several years before the classic Blazing Saddles, the Trinity movies were blazing their own trails into western comedy.  Shiftless, dirty and lazy Trinity rides into town on his back on a makeshift bed dragged by his horse.  He meets up with his outlaw brother who encourages him to do something with his life, such as become a horse thief like he is.  His reply is that he is just too busy doing nothing!  He and his brother are both the fastest guns in the west.  His brother shoots 3 men before they can even unholster their weapons.  Trinity too is very fast on the draw and shoots people coming up behind him or above him with lightening speed.  Sounds a bit violent, but their speed and ability to fight with superhuman strength is amusing and funny at times.  When I first saw this movie years ago I thought it was the funniest thing I had ever seen, but it doesn't quite stand up well over time.  Decent plot involving a bad guy trying to drive Mormon farmers out of a valley that he wants for his horses.  A couple of minor surprises here and there and some funny stuff.  Nice title song too. Well worth owning as a classic to watch now and then when you want something a bit light.  Easy to follow the plot without paying close attention.  Probably okay for the kids too, except for the shootings, although they see plenty of that on TV anyway, so nothing new here.

I don't consider it so much of a spoof , but rather just a zanier version of the genre.  It is a spaghetti western.  Sure, the violence it a bit more toned down(the final battle isn't a shootout, but a huge brawl), but Trinity isn't above blowing someone away if he has to.The Italian comic duo of Hill and Spencer is at a high point here.  While I didn't find the film to be sidesplitting hilarious, it was a good story, and Hill and Spencer have some good chemistry.  They ought to considering how many films they did together.  I always thought of Hill as a kind of slapstick Franco Nero.Many thought that this film brought on the death of the spaghetti western, much as in the way that people think that Abbott and Costello Meets Frankenstein was the death of the Universal horror films.  I suppose that once a genre goes on long enough and starts making them into comedies to breathe new life into it, it's a sign of the end.  The spaghetti western would get a mini revival a few years later, but whether or not Trinity was a last grasp at the genre, I think it ended up being very good.
