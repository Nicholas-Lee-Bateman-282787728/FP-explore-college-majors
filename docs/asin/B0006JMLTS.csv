I think most of the negative reviews of this movie come from those who like the usual junk that National Lampoon puts out, and since  this movie is well written, acted and directed it puts them off. If you're someone who enjoys a well written character study over bathroom humor, I think you'll enjoy this film.",5,I just watched this movie on Hulu.,1283904000,"09 8, 2010",2010,436,"['When', 'see', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'title', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'think', 'most', 'negative', 'reviews', 'movie', 'come', 'who', 'like', 'usual', 'junk', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'out', 'movie', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'directed', 'off', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'well', 'written', 'character', 'study', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film']",N/A

A nice change to see a film that doesn't feature a car chase or a bullet-proof leading man. Also worth mentioning is the soundtrack, with features a nice selection of classic rock tunes.
