1237408,A2K903EV5ONV6,B001TRDQIQ,BillJitsu,"[0, 1]","After seeing and mostly enjoying the original Crank, I decided to check out this sequel.  I was hoping for some more good-natured, mindless, violent entertainment to spice up an otherwise boring Tuesday night.Well, they certainly got the 'mindless' part right.Crank 2: High Voltage starts off reminding the viewer that Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) died at the end of the last movie.  Well, sorta.  See, it turns out that after falling out of a helicopter onto the roof of a car and landing on the concrete, he was immediately picked up by some goons and taken to some seedy underground hospital room where his heart was stolen and replaced with an artificial one.Apparently some bad guys wanted to put Chev's heart into the body of some old lecherous crime-lord named Poon Dong because Poon's was giving out from the rigors of old age and young prostitutes.  Chelios had the strongest heart of anyone they knew, so they decided to go after his.I guess Poon didn't have health insurance or couldn't get on a donor list or something because black market organ harvesting is messy business - especially when the donor wakes up and starts killing all your underlings.One might wonder why an evil old crime boss wouldn't just take Chelios' heart and let him die, rather than spend the money and resources replacing it with an expensive, high-tech, slightly finicky new one.  Or for that matter, why not just replace his with the artificial one to begin with?  It's not like they were trying to make Chelios a slave to Poon Dong, which could have been an interesting twist.  To the contrary, they just start trying to kill Chelios after he's received his heart transplant, which makes you wonder why they bothered keeping him alive in the first place.Of course this type of logic has no real place in a movie like this, so let's just get on with the review...Anyhow, Chelios predictably breaks free of his surgeon captors, and immediately goes on a rampage.  His mission: Get his heart back.Ahh, but there's a catch.  See, his new heart has an external battery that constantly needs to be recharged.  So Chelios has to find new and creative ways to do this in between shooting up bad guys, getting in fist fights, and running from the authorities.  So Chelios is constantly on the lookout for sources of electricity, be it a car battery, power line, or police Taser.Now if this was all there was to the movie, honestly, it wouldn't be too bad.  Silly, yes.  But not terribly more so than the first.Unfortunately, this movie makes some extremely questionable choices in bizarre cut-scenes that made me suspect that someone had slipped some magic mushrooms into my popcorn.These kind of scenes might work if the director was making a short film in the style of David Lynch.  But this isn't that type of movie.  This kind of movie owes its audience what it promises.  Gun fights.  Fist fight.  Sword fights.  Knife fights.  Blood.  Explosions.  A few scenes of gratuitous nudity.  And some more fighting, just for good measure.  Really, that's all the audience wants.Instead of enhancing the story or attempting to add depth to one-dimensional characters, the cut-scenes end up taking screen time away from the main character and making the audience sit through painful, boring, awkward parts when all they really want is some fighting and guns.In short, this film is a bit of a mess.  Worth a rental, maybe, but there are far better films out there in this style that deliver better on what they promise.",2,More than the original in all the wrong ways,1261353600,"12 21, 2009",2009,3496,"['seeing', 'mostly', 'enjoying', 'original', 'Crank', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'sequel', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'good-natured', 'mindless', 'violent', 'entertainment', 'spice', 'up', 'otherwise', 'boring', 'Tuesday', 'night.Well', 'certainly', 'got', ""'mindless"", 'part', 'right.Crank', '2', 'High', 'Voltage', 'reminding', 'viewer', 'Chev', 'Chelios', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'died', 'end', 'last', 'movie', 'Well', 'sorta', 'See', 'out', 'falling', 'helicopter', 'roof', 'car', 'landing', 'concrete', 'was', 'immediately', 'picked', 'up', 'goons', 'taken', 'seedy', 'underground', 'hospital', 'room', 'where', 'heart', 'was', 'stolen', 'replaced', 'artificial', 'one.Apparently', 'bad', 'guys', 'wanted', 'put', 'Chev', 'heart', 'body', 'old', 'lecherous', 'crime-lord', 'named', 'Poon', 'Dong', 'Poon', 'was', 'giving', 'out', 'rigors', 'old', 'age', 'young', 'prostitutes', 'Chelios', 'had', 'strongest', 'heart', 'anyone', 'knew', 'decided', 'go', 'his.I', 'guess', 'Poon', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'health', 'insurance', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'donor', 'list', 'something', 'black', 'market', 'organ', 'harvesting', 'messy', 'business', 'especially', 'when', 'donor', 'up', 'starts', 'killing', 'underlings.One', 'might', 'wonder', 'why', 'evil', 'old', 'crime', 'boss', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'take', 'Chelios', 'heart', 'let', 'die', 'rather', 'spend', 'money', 'resources', 'replacing', 'expensive', 'high-tech', 'slightly', 'finicky', 'new', 'one', 'matter', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'replace', 'artificial', 'one', 'begin', 'not', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'Chelios', 'slave', 'Poon', 'Dong', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'twist', 'contrary', 'just', 'start', 'trying', 'kill', 'Chelios', 'received', 'heart', 'transplant', 'wonder', 'why', 'bothered', 'keeping', 'alive', 'first', 'place.Of', 'course', 'type', 'logic', 'real', 'place', 'movie', 'let', 'just', 'get', 'review', 'Anyhow', 'Chelios', 'predictably', 'free', 'surgeon', 'captors', 'immediately', 'rampage', 'mission', 'Get', 'heart', 'back.Ahh', 'catch', 'See', 'new', 'heart', 'external', 'battery', 'constantly', 'be', 'recharged', 'So', 'Chelios', 'find', 'new', 'creative', 'ways', 'do', 'shooting', 'up', 'bad', 'guys', 'getting', 'fist', 'fights', 'running', 'authorities', 'So', 'Chelios', 'constantly', 'lookout', 'sources', 'electricity', 'be', 'car', 'battery', 'power', 'line', 'police', 'Taser.Now', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'movie', 'honestly', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'bad', 'Silly', 'yes', 'not', 'terribly', 'more', 'so', 'first.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'extremely', 'questionable', 'choices', 'bizarre', 'cut-scenes', 'made', 'suspect', 'someone', 'had', 'slipped', 'magic', 'mushrooms', 'popcorn.These', 'kind', 'scenes', 'might', 'work', 'director', 'was', 'making', 'short', 'film', 'style', 'David', 'Lynch', ""n't"", 'type', 'movie', 'kind', 'movie', 'audience', 'what', 'Gun', 'fights', 'Fist', 'fight', 'Sword', 'fights', 'Knife', 'fights', 'Blood', 'Explosions', 'A', 'few', 'scenes', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'more', 'fighting', 'just', 'good', 'measure', 'Really', 'audience', 'wants.Instead', 'enhancing', 'story', 'attempting', 'add', 'depth', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'cut-scenes', 'end', 'up', 'taking', 'screen', 'time', 'away', 'main', 'character', 'making', 'audience', 'sit', 'painful', 'boring', 'awkward', 'parts', 'when', 'really', 'want', 'fighting', 'guns.In', 'short', 'film', 'bit', 'mess', 'rental', 'maybe', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'style', 'deliver', 'better', 'what', 'promise']",Crank 2 [Theatical Release] [Theatrical Release]

I guess the women in glass bowls distracted me. Regardless, we have more of the same here, just no bowls this time. Mostly it's trying to figure out why suddenly there is no longer any poison in Chev's bloodstream slowing killing him after seeing him literally scrapped off the pavement with a shovel and dumped into the truck of a car. Then on an operating table with his various parts being cut out and sold. He seems to do well with having his heart removed but objects, as any manly man would, to having his ""goodies"" removed, leaps up, slams the doctors around and escapes. Most folks after heart surgery (much less having it completely removed) would have to have a lot of time to recover but not this guy. He's up and around like Superman. But wait, there's more!  We go from amusing, to silly amusing, to silly, to (MOVIE SPOILER) two main characters turned into CG Godzillas battling it out in a miniturized power plant - I kid you not.Appalled at the way Amy Smart was treated in the first I'd concluded there had been script changes because I couldn't understand why someone as talented as Smart would consent to the China Town public sex exhibition. Apparently, I was wrong again! We take public sex to a whole new level when Chev and Eve ""do it"" on a race track, complete with screaming crowds and at least one aroused horse bounding over them. (Oh good, we're back to YEECH!) Dwight Yoakam once again amazes with his performance as Chev's private physician.There is amusing and there is completely idiotic. We being with one, and about 2/3's of the way through this thing pretending to be entertainment find ourselves deeply intrenched in the other.  My advice is, if you must have Statham  -- and I'm one of those -- stick with CRANK and tell yourself over and over, ""There is no CRANK II.  There is no CRANK II.

1237416,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001TRDQIQ,Chris Pandolfi,"[16, 18]","How much abuse can one body take? When we last left Chev Chelios (Jason Statham), he had fallen from a helicopter, bounced off a car, and landed on a street in the middle of Los Angeles. And this was after being injected with a toxin that stopped the production of adrenaline. Now he finds himself in the middle of an operating room, his still-beating heart removed from his chest and replaced with an artificial version that's hooked up to a battery. When the battery gets destroyed, he's left with only an implanted backup generator, and in order for that to keep working, he must keep himself electrically charged. Sometimes, that involves sticking his finger into a car socket. At other times, that involves clamping jumper cables to his nipple and tongue, at which point the person behind the wheel hits the accelerator.The original ""Crank"" was shameless, high octane fun, and so is ""Crank: High Voltage,"" a film that doesn't know the meaning of the word ""excessive."" There's not a trace of humility to be found in any one of its ninety-six minutes. It's an unabashedly crude crime caper that uses four-letter dialogue as if being paid by the letter. It's an in-your-face assault on the senses, a hyperactive video game that never makes use of the pause button. Normally, these would be the hallmarks of a God-awful film, but in this case, they're the hallmarks of a stylish thrill ride that's just as funny as it is shocking. It's a movie so audacious in its insanity that I pretty much have to recommend it; it may not be the most edifying thing you'll ever see, but it certainly will be the most unforgettable hour-and-a-half you've had all spring.The story: An Asian gangster named Johnny Vang (Art Hsu) is somewhere in Los Angeles with Chelios' heart, which is said to be indestructible and therefore perfect for harvesting. Chelios, with only a weakly powered artificial heart to work with, goes on a frantic search, stopping every so often to recharge. Along the way, he meets a number of ... interesting people. There's his old flame, Eve (Amy Smart), who now works as a stripper. There's a Chinese prostitute named Ria (Ling Bai), who clings to Chelios like a dog in heat and uses language that would make a sailor blush. There's Venus (Efren Ramirez), who's on a mission to avenge the death of his twin brother, Kaylo. Chelios has an occasional phone conversation with Doc Miles (Dwight Yoakam), who was once a heart surgeon before losing his license.The movie is filled with unbelievable moments, but there are three in particular so priceless that I have to describe them. The first takes place at Hollywood Park, where a horse race is being held. Miles tells Chelios that, in a pinch, skin to skin friction will generate enough static electricity to keep his battery going. When Eve learns of this, she and Chelios begin creating their own ""friction""--in the middle of the racing track to a cheering crowd of thousands. The second takes place in a power grid. Chelios and Vang start fighting, at which point the scene turns into a cheesy Asian monster movie, complete with unconvincing miniatures and makeup effects. The third is a strange flashback sequence revealing Chelios as a child (Billy Unger). He and his mother are on a talk show discussing why he became such a juvenile delinquent.None of this has any real bearing on the story; they're nothing more than excuses for the movie to be ill-mannered and/or goofy. There are, of course, many other instances of these extremes, but they're all so over the top that I probably wouldn't be able to describe them anyway.I leave it to you to see what happens at the end. Let it suffice to say that the shot before the end credits perfectly sums up everything the filmmakers set out to do. It would not be enough to say that this movie is bizarre; it's so outlandish that it pretty much defies the conventions of genre. Comparisons can be made to ""Shoot `Em Up,"" Michael Davis' no-holds-barred, brilliantly original action film from 2007 that made use of stylized violence and a delightfully sick sense of humor. Both films also feature a British leading man. This leads me to why ""Shoot `Em Up"" is the more successful film: Clive Owen gave us a performance we hadn't seen him give before. Jason Statham, on the other hand, has starred almost exclusively in extreme action films, so there's very little he can do to surprise us.Nevertheless, I'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy this movie, and it has everything to do with how far it goes. There's a difference between a movie that goes too far and a movie like ""Crank: High Voltage""--the latter goes so far, it actually surpasses offensiveness and becomes entertaining. This is cinematic decadence at its most potent, an unbridled foray into the mind-numbing depths of action, comedy, and yes, even sex. One of the earliest cues is given by John de Lancie, who plays a TV anchorman; he describes the events of the first film as implausible. No, he doesn't just say the word. He pauses momentarily before accenting the word, as if to let the audience know that they're in store for yet another round of sheer lunacy. The writing/directing team of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor could have made a tamer film, I suppose, but like Chev Chelios, they're hearts just weren't in it.",4,I Left My Heart in Los

There are lots of sequences in the film that I've never seen done before, and for that it has to be admired. However, like a lot of sequels it suffers from the ""let's do it bigger and badder"" mentality. Some of the gory scenes were really unpleasant and fairly unneccessary. The first 45 minutes or so of the film are undoubtedly good fun though and there are lots of jaw dropping moments, where I thought ""I can't believe they just did that!"" Jason Statham delivers some hilarious lines too. The biggest problem is the lack of plot. I could tolerate that for a while but towards the end the film really starts to drag and becomes almost an art-house film with some of the crazy things they try.

But therein lies the problem - it feels so video game-ish that we lose all feeling for the character Chev.  Jason Statham is getting old in these kinds of films and has become a genre in himself.Here's why I didn't like it: way too frenetic, seizure inducing edits and too many over-the-top moments.  It feels like the filmmakers are taking your head and bashing it against the wall time after time.  There's no letting up and no respite.  The funny parts are good but the first Crank was way better.  Somehow, the filmmakers decided to up the ante this time round by throwing in everything including the kitchen sink and in doing so, created a really self-indulgent cult film.  Casting wise, Dwight Yoakam is great as Doc, and David Carradine appears in one of his last roles as a triad godfather.The original Crank was well done but this sequel overstays its welcome.  Some restraint might have worked in its favor.PS - the real achievement of the film is that it was shot on prosumer digital cameras.  Inspiring technical choice with great results, but this alone doesn't make the film.

1237441,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001TRDQIQ,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","I know it's farfetched but just in case my heart ever is ripped out of my chest and replaced with a battery-powered mechanical pump, I am furiously taking notes as I watch this sequel. I admit that whoever came up with this screenplay had to have been sipping from the goofy juice, the narrative is that loopy. I could've sworn there was no way to resurrect rugged paid assassin Chev Chelios after his mile-long plummet from helicopter to unforgiving terra firma, but survive he improbably did. CRANK 2: HIGH VOLTAGE demonstrates the how. Also, one peek at the film title should present a quick clue that this movie isn't about Jason Statham's character knitting in a rocking chair all the live-long day. Jason Statham is a trooper, to take on some of the insane stuff he's asked to do here.CRANK 2 picks up moments after the first film leaves off. We revisit Chev Chelios' seemingly fatal plunge from that helicopter in downtown Los Angeles, his harsh caroming off a car roof and face planting onto cement - that's how CRANK ended it. But, in the sequel, seconds later, Triad hoods pull up and spatula Chev Chelios off the pavement. Three months elapse during which Chelios undergoes massive surgery, and it's at this stage that his highly coveted heart is removed and the Avicor Artificial Heart System - basically a battery-powered artificial pump - is implanted into his chest cavity. Upon learning that there are plans to harvest even more organs from his body, a frantic Chelios escapes captivity and begins his odd quest to reclaim his heart. His target is Johnny Vang, him what carries around a suspicious ice cooler. But Chev has to go thru a gauntlet of Triad goons and Mexican mobsters, overzealous cops and incensed porn stars on strike (look for real-life porn stars Ron Jeremy and Jenna Haze in this throng screaming out slogans like ""No dough, no blow.""). Our heartless hitman also finds himself fending off the unwanted attentions of a wacked-out Asian prostitute (Bai Ling). For now, Chev Chelios has to make do with the artificial pump, and what sucks is that he has to keep electrically charging the pump's battery. At least long enough for him to retrieve his ""strawberry tart"" (which is cockney slang for ""heart"").And that's the film's primary hook, really, Chelios unearthing all manner of messed-up ways to keep the pump device topped up. It's crazy how he applies jumper cables and tasers on himself. In one instance, he even puts on an elecric dog collar and continually shocks himself. But maybe the funniest bit is when Chelios is at a horse-racing track and begins to rub himself against complete strangers, trying to muster static electricity. This sequence leads to a reprise of a famous crowd-pleasing scene from the first film.CRANK 2 is gleefully unapologetic about its political incorrectness. It flaunts it, actually. CRANK 2 churns out elements of satire, crassness, manic brutality, and even casual racism. It for sure is damn irreverent and over-the-top and so offbeat even beatniks are thrown off. It's shot frenetically, with a hyper-realistic sensibility in mind, and it may take a bit of time before you acclimate to the disorienting camera movements. Dwight Yoakam and Amy Smart reprise their roles, only it's disappointing that Amy Smart's character Eve has been dumbed down and trivialized even more. Efren Ramirez is also back but this time he plays the brother of his character from the first movie, and maybe it's wrong to laugh at the guy's disability but when the writers saddle a character with something called full body tourettes, hey, I'll play along and willingly laugh on cue. CRANK 2 ventures into What-the-F territory. You'll be up to your ears in sudden claymation figures, disembodied talking heads, and a jarringly inserted talk show segment. Again, roll with the punches. Tasteless and offensive and lewd, ridiculously violent and pretty much certifiable, this movie marches to the beat of its own drummer. It's even more absurd than the first CRANK. And, no, it's probably not for everyone. Me, though, I laughed like a mother.",4,"""Who's got my f---ing strawberry tart?""",1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,4090,"['know', 'farfetched', 'just', 'case', 'heart', 'ever', 'ripped', 'chest', 'replaced', 'battery-powered', 'mechanical', 'pump', 'am', 'furiously', 'taking', 'notes', 'watch', 'sequel', 'admit', 'came', 'up', 'screenplay', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'sipping', 'goofy', 'juice', 'narrative', 'loopy', 'could', ""'ve"", 'sworn', 'was', 'way', 'resurrect', 'rugged', 'paid', 'assassin', 'Chev', 'Chelios', 'mile-long', 'plummet', 'helicopter', 'unforgiving', 'terra', 'firma', 'survive', 'improbably', 'did', 'CRANK', '2', 'HIGH', 'VOLTAGE', 'how', 'Also', 'one', 'peek', 'film', 'title', 'should', 'present', 'quick', 'clue', 'movie', ""n't"", 'Jason', 'Statham', 'character', 'knitting', 'rocking', 'chair', 'live-long', 'day', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'trooper', 'take', 'insane', 'stuff', 'asked', 'do', 'here.CRANK', '2', 'picks', 'moments', 'first', 'film', 'off', 'revisit', 'Chev', 'Chelios', 'seemingly', 'fatal', 'plunge', 'helicopter', 'downtown', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'harsh', 'caroming', 'off', 'car', 'roof', 'face', 'planting', 'cement', 'how', 'CRANK', 'ended', 'sequel', 'later', 'Triad', 'hoods', 'pull', 'up', 'spatula', 'Chev', 'Chelios', 'pavement', 'Three', 'months', 'Chelios', 'undergoes', 'massive', 'surgery', 'stage', 'highly', 'coveted', 'heart', 'removed', 'Avicor', 'Artificial', 'Heart', 'System', 'basically', 'battery-powered', 'artificial', 'pump', 'implanted', 'chest', 'cavity', 'learning', 'are', 'plans', 'harvest', 'even', 'more', 'organs', 'body', 'frantic', 'Chelios', 'captivity', 'odd', 'quest', 'reclaim', 'heart', 'target', 'Johnny', 'Vang', 'what', 'around', 'suspicious', 'ice', 'cooler', 'Chev', 'go', 'thru', 'gauntlet', 'Triad', 'goons', 'Mexican', 'mobsters', 'overzealous', 'cops', 'incensed', 'porn', 'stars', 'strike', 'look', 'real-life', 'porn', 'stars', 'Ron', 'Jeremy', 'Jenna', 'Haze', 'throng', 'screaming', 'out', 'slogans', 'No', 'dough', 'blow.', 'heartless', 'hitman', 'also', 'fending', 'off', 'unwanted', 'attentions', 'wacked-out', 'Asian', 'prostitute', 'Bai', 'Ling', 'now', 'Chev', 'Chelios', 'make', 'do', 'artificial', 'pump', 'what', 'sucks', 'keep', 'electrically', 'charging', 'pump', 'battery', 'least', 'long', 'enough', 'retrieve', 'strawberry', 'tart', 'cockney', 'slang', 'heart', '.And', 'film', 'primary', 'hook', 'really', 'Chelios', 'unearthing', 'manner', 'messed-up', 'ways', 'keep', 'pump', 'device', 'topped', 'up', 'crazy', 'how', 'jumper', 'cables', 'tasers', 'one', 'instance', 'even', 'elecric', 'dog', 'collar', 'continually', 'shocks', 'maybe', 'funniest', 'bit', 'when', 'Chelios', 'horse-racing', 'track', 'rub', 'complete', 'strangers', 'trying', 'muster', 'static', 'electricity', 'sequence', 'reprise', 'famous', 'crowd-pleasing', 'scene', 'first', 'film.CRANK', '2', 'gleefully', 'unapologetic', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'actually', 'CRANK', '2', 'churns', 'elements', 'satire', 'crassness', 'manic', 'brutality', 'even', 'casual', 'racism', 'sure', 'damn', 'irreverent', 'over-the-top', 'so', 'offbeat', 'even', 'beatniks', 'are', 'thrown', 'off', 'shot', 'frenetically', 'hyper-realistic', 'sensibility', 'mind', 'may', 'take', 'bit', 'time', 'acclimate', 'disorienting', 'camera', 'movements', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'reprise', 'roles', 'only', 'disappointing', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'character', 'Eve', 'been', 'dumbed', 'down', 'trivialized', 'even', 'more', 'Efren', 'Ramirez', 'also', 'back', 'time', 'brother', 'character', 'first', 'movie', 'maybe', 'wrong', 'laugh', 'guy', 'disability', 'when', 'writers', 'saddle', 'character', 'something', 'called', 'full', 'body', 'tourettes', 'hey', ""'ll"", 'play', 'along', 'willingly', 'laugh', 'cue', 'CRANK', '2', 'ventures', 'What-the-F', 'territory', ""'ll"", 'be', 'up', 'ears', 'sudden', 'claymation', 'figures', 'disembodied', 'talking', 'heads', 'jarringly', 'inserted', 'talk', 'show', 'segment', 'Again', 'roll', 'punches', 'Tasteless', 'offensive', 'lewd', 'ridiculously', 'violent', 'pretty', 'much', 'certifiable', 'movie', 'beat', 'own', 'drummer', 'even', 'more', 'absurd', 'first', 'CRANK', 'probably', 'not', 'everyone', 'Me', 'laughed', 'mother']",Crank 2 [Theatical Release] [Theatrical Release]

I for one is pretty versatile when it comes to films and for those who know me can vouch for it. After I'd seen Crank 1 I couldn't wait to see Crank 2. It moves at such a frantic pace that you will probably miss a few things during the first viewing so I had to see it twice.For those of you who don't know story wise, don't sweat it. It's just as bad as the previous installment. Voltage beings where the original ended with the Stath falling a mile from a helicopter and bouncing off a parked car - dead presumably, but no because the Chinese warlord responsible for his original poisoned predicament has Staham's Chev Chelios scraped off the roadside and deposited in a makeshift surgical theatre where his heart, strong enough to survive the original film and so a desirable commodity for his wizened nemesis, is extracted and replaced with a battery powered stopgap designed to keep him alive and his organs fresh for transplantation. You'd be forgiven for losing the thread at this point but the movie is only 5 minutes old when Chelios thankfully regains consciousness and on Doctor's orders, begins a hunt for his real heart while subjecting himself to electric shocks to keep the temporary one functioning.That, if you can believe it, is the setup, and you won't be shocked to learn that it's a fairly sober foundation for what follows. Shot on prosumer camcorders, Crank 2 is saturated in the promise of bargain basement vulgarity and doesn't disappoint. Edited with an eye for the absurd, it feverishly presses on across ninety monged out minutes in which guns are inserted into rectums, nipples sliced from torsos, fights segue into Godzilla style monsters battling against miniatures (with actors in caricatured masks of Statham and his enemy battling it out) and in the funniest sequence, Geri Halliwell appears in flashback as Mother Chelios, taking the young Chev to task on a talk show in which a few British cars and a reject from a mad max movie dressed as a British punk are dropped onto a Californian back lot for the least convincing but most enjoyable English flashback you've ever seen. Chelios may be a hard-line misogynist and causal racist, but there's something about the former Sydenham market trader that would make him likable. Jason Statham preforms brilliantly once again as Chev Chilos. But if you look closer to the film you will see cameo performance of Cory Haims(The Lost Boys) and David Carradine(Kill Bill).Like I said if you can handle violence, blood, shootings, gratuitous nudity, foul and offensive language involving hilarious one liners from Jason Statham then give it a shot.

1237455,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001TRDQIQ,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","The firstCrank (Widescreen Edition)movie was one of the most unique movies I've ever seen. It was 80 minutes of non-stop action that went completely over-the-top...When I saw the trailer for the second movie, I instantly thought 'wtf? seriously?' The trailer showed a similar gimmick to the first movie (instead of keeping up his adrenaline, main character Chev Chelios needs to keep his heart electrically-charged), only one that not only defied all logic but threw all logic out the window. I did not have high hopes for this sequel, at all.What surprised me is that I liked this film better than it's predecessor. What Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor (the writers and directors) have done is taken all of the elements that made the first movie good and only added more action and more absurdity.Jason Statham retuns as Chev Chelios, who we last saw falling out of a helicopter and landing in a Los Angeles intersection. Well, as this film begins, he is scraped off of said intersection by the Chinese so they can remove his ""superman heart,"" which they replace with an artificial heart requiring an electrical charge. Chev is soon in pursuit of Johnny Vang (Art Hsu), whom Chev believes has his heart, and runs into Eve (Amy Smart) and just about every other character from the first movie along the way.When I said that Neveldine/Taylor took all the elements that made the first film successful, I wasn't kidding; actors appear here whether they died in the first film or not (Efren Ramirez returns playing Venus, the brother of Kaylo, who died in the first movie) and Statham and Smart have another public sex-scene together.Audiences need to keep in mind when watching this that it's basically a filmed video-game. Anything is possible, nothing is off-limits. This movie requires one to suspend all disbelief to truly enjoy it.Crank: High Voltage is one of the best action films of 2009 and is also hysterically funny. It's the ultimate guy movie, really. Is any scene from a 2009-movie more ridiculously random than the ""Godzilla"" power-plant scene? If you enjoyed the first movie, you should love this one as well.

But watching the two back to back yesterday made me realize that Crank:High Voltage was simply one-upping the first in anarchic fashion, and seen from that perspective, and with all expectations turned off, this is one weird, wild flick.Neveldine and Taylor shoot in HD and this blu-ray disc is amazing, state of the art like their other movies. And that crispness is well-used by the insane shots and colorful weirdness here, as well as some nicely washed out scenes with flat color palettes that contrast nicely. If you like eye candy, you'll love this. And if you like being surprised, step right up.The story makes zero effort at seriousness; the word ""implausible"" is mentioned early on and is a good watchword for C:HV. Nothing here is meant to be taken seriously, merely to be entertaining. Crank's silly Chinatown scene is echoed by a horse race version, a sign that N/T are here purely for the laughs and the action. And Amy Smart delevers a whole new side of raunchy goofiness to her character this time around.While not as non-stop as Crank, HV does have more than its share of action, and the whole recharge theme is played for laughs pretty well, especially as Statham gives his all to those shots. His face is very funny at times, and this must be his most humorous turn to date.Too wild and weird for some, no doubt, this movie will be perfect eye candy/brainfreeze for others. If you like Statham, Smart, the craziness and visual clarity of N/T, and/or general insanity, then you'll enjoy this silly ride.",4,"Not as good as Crank but still wild and entertaining, looks amazing on blu-ray",1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,1609,"['3.8', 'starsI', 'loved', 'first', 'Crank', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'sequel', 'was', 'disappointed', 'watching', 'two', 'back', 'back', 'yesterday', 'made', 'realize', 'Crank', 'High', 'Voltage', 'was', 'simply', 'one-upping', 'first', 'anarchic', 'fashion', 'seen', 'perspective', 'expectations', 'turned', 'off', 'one', 'weird', 'wild', 'flick.Neveldine', 'Taylor', 'shoot', 'HD', 'blu-ray', 'disc', 'amazing', 'state', 'art', 'other', 'movies', 'crispness', 'well-used', 'insane', 'shots', 'colorful', 'weirdness', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'nicely', 'washed', 'out', 'scenes', 'flat', 'color', 'contrast', 'nicely', 'like', 'eye', 'candy', ""'ll"", 'love', 'like', 'being', 'surprised', 'step', 'right', 'up.The', 'story', 'zero', 'effort', 'seriousness', 'word', 'implausible', 'mentioned', 'early', 'good', 'watchword', 'C', 'HV', 'Nothing', 'here', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'merely', 'be', 'entertaining', 'Crank', 'silly', 'Chinatown', 'scene', 'echoed', 'horse', 'race', 'version', 'sign', 'N/T', 'are', 'here', 'purely', 'laughs', 'action', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'whole', 'new', 'side', 'raunchy', 'goofiness', 'character', 'time', 'not', 'as', 'non-stop', 'Crank', 'HV', 'have', 'more', 'share', 'action', 'whole', 'recharge', 'theme', 'played', 'laughs', 'pretty', 'well', 'especially', 'Statham', 'shots', 'face', 'very', 'funny', 'times', 'must', 'be', 'most', 'humorous', 'turn', 'date.Too', 'wild', 'weird', 'doubt', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'perfect', 'eye', 'candy/brainfreeze', 'others', 'like', 'Statham', 'Smart', 'craziness', 'visual', 'clarity', 'N/T', 'general', 'insanity', 'then', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'silly', 'ride']",Crank 2 [Theatical Release] [Theatrical Release]

I really liked the first one, the story was good, characters were good, and violence...spot on!This movie wasn't the upgrade I was hoping for, its got a lot of scenes running at double speed (I guess to simulate the rush of having to find power for the heart) I think it was used way to much, it gets repetitive.  The whole movie plays out with Chev going from point A to point B and stopping somewhere in between for some ""juice"".I didn't expect an epic story line or anything, I just feel like the first one played out a lot better, the pace was good and the characters were easy to keep track of...which is a must in a movie like this.  All and all its worth a watch if your an action junkie but I can honestly say I would have been good watching the first one and just stopping there.On a side note, a good side note at that: The Blu-Ray version kinda, yes kinda redeems this film. The picture is a amazing, which surprised me really.  I think back to a scene with a bunch of cargo containers, the detail in the painted metal surfaces is jaw dropping.  Also for the scenes with a speed boost, the picture stays crisp and clean.  Blu-Ray also gives us a bonus with the sound here, just know the 7.1 DTS:MA sounds stunning!  The movie never lets up with crashes, gun shots, screams, stuff breaking, and the screaming of the F-word every 10-15 seconds comes over loud and clear!Rent this one, enjoy it with a beer and some hot wings...but don't expect to say WOW! in a good way, when the credits roll.",2,WOW...and not in a good way,1253059200,"09 16, 2009",2009,1556,"['Well', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'bit', 'unhappy', 'film', 'really', 'liked', 'first', 'one', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'characters', 'were', 'good', 'violence', 'spot', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'upgrade', 'was', 'hoping', 'got', 'lot', 'scenes', 'running', 'double', 'speed', 'guess', 'simulate', 'rush', 'having', 'find', 'power', 'heart', 'think', 'was', 'used', 'way', 'much', 'repetitive', 'whole', 'movie', 'out', 'Chev', 'going', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'stopping', 'somewhere', 'juice', '.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'epic', 'story', 'line', 'anything', 'just', 'feel', 'first', 'one', 'played', 'out', 'lot', 'better', 'pace', 'was', 'good', 'characters', 'were', 'easy', 'keep', 'track', 'must', 'movie', 'worth', 'watch', 'action', 'junkie', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'watching', 'first', 'one', 'just', 'stopping', 'there.On', 'side', 'note', 'good', 'side', 'note', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'kinda', 'yes', 'kinda', 'film', 'picture', 'amazing', 'surprised', 'really', 'think', 'back', 'scene', 'bunch', 'cargo', 'containers', 'detail', 'painted', 'metal', 'surfaces', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'Also', 'scenes', 'speed', 'boost', 'picture', 'crisp', 'clean', 'Blu-Ray', 'also', 'bonus', 'sound', 'here', 'just', 'know', '7.1', 'DTS', 'MA', 'stunning', 'movie', 'never', 'up', 'crashes', 'gun', 'shots', 'screams', 'stuff', 'breaking', 'screaming', 'F-word', '10-15', 'seconds', 'loud', 'clear', 'Rent', 'one', 'beer', 'hot', 'wings', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'say', 'WOW', 'good', 'way', 'when', 'credits', 'roll']",Crank 2 [Theatical Release] [Theatrical Release]

Crank was not made to have a deep plot it was made to be stait forward and fun.For fans of the first one, this one is almost identical. Amy Smart comes back as Eve, Chelios's girlfriend from the first movie. The chemistry between the two in this one is a lot hotter then before. and as you would suspect there is alot more gratuitous nudity, violence and gore.For parents, this earns a hardcore R rating. there is full frontal female nudity and you see Stathams butt a few times. there is also extremely simulated Sex, the F word is also used well over 100 times throught the movie. there is also alot of violence, shooting and killing of people. if you are not sure if your kid should see this, do not show it to them, this is every bad part of a R rated movie rolled into an Hr and a half.If you have not seen the first one i would recomend to rent it before you see two, though Crank 2 is very entertaining to watch on its own, if you have seen the first one you cna catch all the little inside joke and returning themes from the first one. Over all if you are over 17 and you want to watch something that is going to be very entertaining see this moive.

If that's what you want, this is the movie for you to get. If you're looking for a masterpiece movie with a serious story, step away now!(Possible spoilers for the first 5 minutes of the movie (including the end of Crank 1))The first movie ends with Statham falling out of a helicopter and smacking the concrete below, and that's just where this one begins (literally!) - being Crank, he lives and just gets up to walk away from it. He's quickly taken away to have his heart removed to be implanted into someone else (if he can live through everything in the first film, it's gotta be something amazing!). With his heart gone, he's living off a very-poor-quality artificial one.. with a low battery which he constantly needs to power (and as you can imagine, that includes all sorts of nonsense methods) - he goes on a search to get his heart back. While all this seems crazy, this is just the first 5 minutes - along the way he runs into every odd person you can imagine. If this seems like the stupidest movie you've ever heard, stop reading now! If you're interested in that much, I think you'll enjoy the movie. It's a crazy ride, but an entertaining one (definitely not for kids).The blu-ray is one of the best looking ones I've seen. I believe it was filmed with the RED cameras, and has a very sharp image throughout. This makes a wonderful demo piece for a nice HDTV!Audio is also top notch - DTSHD 7.1 Master Audio. Crank it up!

Crank: High Voltage is a roller coaster ride that last 85 minutes and features some really gross scenes. For example, a guy getting a shotgun rammed up his rear end isn't even in the top three weird moments in this flick. There was one scene where a guy had to punish himself for letting his boss down, which I had to turn my head and look away (I can't remember the last time I did that). There is almost zero realism here, much like the original, only multiplied by a hundred. Jason Statham is the main action star in the business right now and he is pretty good at what he does.

I honestly can't think of a better tagline to a recent movie than that, but Crank 2: High Voltage manages to take the levels of ridiculousness introduced in the first film to whole new levels.

As said before, Crank 2 takes implausibility to whole new levels, and writers/directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor know this and revel in it.  It's absurdly violent, incredibly offensive, and undoubtedly funny to boot, and the fact that returning stars Statham, Amy Smart, Dwight Yoakam, and Efren Ramirez manage to keep straight faces throughout the proceedings are giant accomplishments in themselves.  Also featuring hysterical turns from Bai Ling, Clifton Collins Jr, Corey Haim (yes, Corey Haim), and the late great David Carradine; Crank 2: High Voltage is guaranteed entertainment if you enjoyed the first film in the least, and is guaranteed as something to definitely avoid if none of the aforementioned sounds appealing to you in the least.",3,Takes ridiculousness to a whole new level,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,1281,"['was', 'dead', 'got', 'better', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'tagline', 'recent', 'movie', 'Crank', '2', 'High', 'Voltage', 'take', 'levels', 'ridiculousness', 'introduced', 'first', 'film', 'whole', 'new', 'levels', 'Hitman', 'Chev', 'Chelios', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'up', 'find', 'artificial', 'heart', 'constantly', 'charging', 'city', 'searching', 'stolen', 'indestructable', 'heart', 'wake', 'multitude', 'destruction', 'sex', 'ridiculous', 'levels', 'offensive', 'violence', 'said', 'Crank', '2', 'implausibility', 'whole', 'new', 'levels', 'writers/directors', 'Mark', 'Neveldine', 'Brian', 'Taylor', 'know', 'revel', 'absurdly', 'violent', 'incredibly', 'offensive', 'undoubtedly', 'funny', 'boot', 'fact', 'returning', 'stars', 'Statham', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'Efren', 'Ramirez', 'manage', 'keep', 'straight', 'proceedings', 'are', 'giant', 'accomplishments', 'Also', 'featuring', 'hysterical', 'turns', 'Bai', 'Ling', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'yes', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'late', 'great', 'David', 'Carradine', 'Crank', '2', 'High', 'Voltage', 'guaranteed', 'entertainment', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'film', 'least', 'guaranteed', 'something', 'definitely', 'avoid', 'none', 'aforementioned', 'sounds', 'appealing', 'least']",Crank 2 [Theatical Release] [Theatrical Release]

And not just rough and tumble bvrutal.  No. It's brutal beyond belief.  I had to rewind the ""sushi"" scene at least 4 or 5 times just to make sure I actually was seeing what was going on. Then, some guy cuts his own nipples off.  Ever wonder what happens if a stripper gets shot in her boob job?  Wonder no more.It's offensive.  Besides the racial and sexual stereotypes, it's as though everyone in LA is scum. The cops, the gangsters, the old ladies.  Everyone.  (I've heard that's the case, but I've never been there so I can't confirm.  but it seems like fun.)  And Bai ling is great as the kooky prostitue that murders the English language.  Yes, baby.  I will be your shiny lunchbox. It's about time a film lays it out and puts everyone on guard in this PC world that makes us scared to think freely.  Does it promote prejudice?  Hell no.  Does it make fun of stereotypes?  Hell yeah.It's got lots of sexual stuff in it.  Maybe it's the hormone charged 16-year-old that still controls my brain, but I loved that aspect of the film. Stripper lesbian making out in a cop car,.  Porn star protests.  A chinese crimelord witha  fetish for black chicks and a yen to steal our prtagonist's johnson.  BAM! Suddenly there's a horse dong thrown in for good measure.It's absurd.  The use of video game graphics, flashbacks, surreal asides, and the full-blown kaiju battle make this morsel of celluloid worthy of your time and appreciation. Plus, it's centered around a guy who needs to electrocute himself to stay alive.  throw in a gay biker gang, a floating head in fluid with a robot voice, and an one of the best endings EVER: FLAMES, BURNING FLESH AND THE MIDDLE FINGER.This film does not set out to change the world.

A hitman, Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is injected with a poison that leaves him no option but to keep his adrenaline pumping nonstop or die. Clearly, the makings of an intense action film, which is what we got. From start to finish it was violent fury, with much more than its fair share of macabre murder humor. The end finds him surviving against impossible odds, although how alive he is can't be told by the simple blink of his eye that we are given.Crank 2 picks up from that moment. Chelios's body is hustled off by some sinister Chinese men and he is operated on and kept in a medical room for a couple months. By the time he regains awareness (just in time to save his privates from being donated to a mob boss) his heart is missing, replaced by an electronic pumper which he must keep electrically charged.So we switch from Chelios doing every insane thing he can to keep his excitement up, to Chelios racing after a box with his heart in it, stopping every now and then to find some way to electrocute himself and (whoa! yeah!) kickstart his heart.Okay, this is madness enough as it is. It's amplified by extra amounts of gore, more grotesque brutality, more perversion, porn star and metalhead cameos, irreverant sidetracking, and a few complete losses of all reality that are far and away the funniest parts of the film.Oh, and they bought their cameras at Best Buy. It gave it a frantic, independent, in your face, bewildering feel. Between that and the brutal humor and carefree violence, I was surprised at the lack of a cameo from Troma's Lloyd Kaufman. The whole film's right up his alley (minus the $12.9 million price tag, I guess).It doesn't end there though. This gleefully sadistic film, shot on cheap cameras, was perfectly scored by Mike Patton. The movie is blessed throughout with an eerie, playful, rock soundtrack that suits it perfectly.Crank 2 is definitely not a movie suitable for a lot of people. Its unashamedly violent and crude to the point of absolutely sick pleasure. There is no redeeming moral code, no truly honorable character. They're all angry, dysfunctional and bent. But it is a masterpiece of divergence. There's really nothing like it. If the bloodier, the meaner, the more out of touch with believablity the film, the more you'll like it, this is for you.

Topping its predecessor in every manner of excessive vulgarities, Crank's acknowledgment and subsequent self-reflective mockery of its own escapist anti-realism produces a highly engaging exercise in both parody and hurdling over the boundaries of good taste. Wholesome entertainment this is not. But it's entertainment nonetheless.For relentlessly revenge-driven and eternally enraged hitman Chev Chelios (Jason Statham), not even death could slow him down. After being poisoned, beaten, shot, and falling several thousand feet onto unforgiving pavement, Chelios is alive and well, save for having his indestructible heart stolen by Chinese mobsters and replaced with a mechanical one. Now forced to re-energize his ticker with bursts of electricity at frequent intervals, the bitter killer must hunt down his assailants while simultaneously fending off nearly limitless enemies from his past. On his side is vitriolic girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart), maniacal ex-doctor Miles (Dwight Yoakum), spastic ally Venus (Efren Ramirez) and an unquenchable thirst for vengeance.Crank: High Voltage finally recognizes the shortcomings of the original and uses them to its advantage. Realizing that an attempt at serious hardcore action gave way to unrealistic, hyper-stylized, implausibly frenetic chaos and unintentional humor allows High Voltage to break free from its restraints and fully embrace the over-the-top humor that Crank reservedly craved. The utter nonsense that surrounds this fast-paced sequel that refuses to take itself seriously oozes with bloodthirsty violence, overdoses of risqu&eacute; sex in very public places and crazily callous cursing.""Fatal"" means nothing to the seemingly invincible Chelios or to the wide assortment of oddballs that frequent his odyssey. It's crude, cruel, coarse, and off-color and perhaps the best brainless escapism to bombard the action film scene in much too long.

1237496,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001TRDQIQ,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 15]","0 StarsEvery so often, I go to a movie that would probably seem like an odd choice for someone who loves films. When I tell others about the film I have recently subjected myself to, their immediate response is ""You saw that?"" I frequently go to silly action films because I enjoy watching the preposterous stunts and action scenes the filmmakers come up with. Usually. Most of the time, these films aren't any good. But I also feel like you need to see the bad in order to fully appreciate the good.And then there are films like ""Crank - High Voltage"". I remember actually enjoying ""Crank"" because is was an incredibly fast-paced film (most of the story is revealed in grunts as Jason Statham's Chev Chellos barrels through the story) and was strangely ""off"". All of the characters were more bad than good and everyone was looking out for himself.But now, after seeing ""High Voltage"", I am wondering if I am remembering the first film too fondly.Picking up where the last film ended, literally, we watch as Chev drops out of a plane and hits a car on a Los Angeles street. The guy he was fighting with lands on the pavement nearby, dead. Chev is still alive, but barely. Then a van pulls up and a bunch of Chinese gang members pull Chev inside. Later, he wakes up in a brothel with Chinese doctors standing around him, admiring their handiwork. They have removed his heart and replaced it with an artificial model that runs on a battery, which they have conveniently strapped, to his chest. He makes an escape and soon learns he needs to constantly re-charge the battery, so he applies jumper cables and the like to his tongue. But he also wants to find the Chinese gang leader who stole his heart and begins to battle his way through the streets, following leads and working towards his goal. A group of Latino gang members are also on the hunt. And Chev runs into (Amy Smart) who is working at a strip club. She rejoins him for part of the ride.""High Voltage"" is such a waste of time I find it difficult to adequately explain why.And I really am beginning to wonder what I found so 'fun' in the first film.In ""High Voltage"", the filmmakers take no time to explain who Chev is, so I guess they are assuming only people who have seen the first entry will spend any money to see this second installment in the saga of Chelios. Honestly, I forget what Chev is, so I didn't have a clue as I sat there watching Statham careen through one set of bad guys after another.Because Statham is always moving, it is all but impossible for him to do anything but grunt or shout. When his new artificial heart begins to slow down, he pauses, and looks groggy for a few seconds until he spots some new source of electrical current.Amy Smart appears for about twenty minutes, entering the story on the weakest of pretenses, hanging on Chev's arm as he tries to outrun the current crop of bad guys and then disappears, popping up again for no specific reason.Clifton Collins Jr. (""Capote"", ""Sunshine Cleaning"") pops up at the end of the film in a role that is such a ludicrous caricature I am surprised we haven't heard from any Latino Rights groups. But maybe they are doing the smart thing and standing by the sidelines, letting this film die a quick death. If they were to protest, they would only bring attention to this film and lengthen the life of this piece of trash.Dwight Yoakam returns as Chev's friend, a disgraced doctor who helps Chev navigate the treacherous waters of his newest ailment. His character is depraved and clearly enjoys his newfound status as an outcast of society. In ""High Voltage"", he spends much of his time licking, touching or caressing the near naked buttocks of an African American prostitute.David Carradine also makes an appearance as a Chinese gang boss. Honestly, his appearance is more laughable than anything else as he is made up to look like his character from ""Kung Fu"" but as a senior citizen.Just rehashing all of this has left a bad taste in my mouth.Consider yourself warned.",1,Crank has Zero Voltage,1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,4009,"['0', 'StarsEvery', 'so', 'often', 'go', 'movie', 'would', 'probably', 'seem', 'odd', 'choice', 'someone', 'who', 'films', 'When', 'tell', 'others', 'film', 'have', 'recently', 'subjected', 'immediate', 'response', 'saw', 'frequently', 'go', 'silly', 'action', 'films', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'preposterous', 'stunts', 'action', 'scenes', 'filmmakers', 'come', 'up', 'Usually', 'Most', 'time', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'also', 'feel', 'need', 'see', 'bad', 'order', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'good.And', 'then', 'are', 'films', 'Crank', 'High', 'Voltage', 'remember', 'actually', 'enjoying', 'Crank', 'was', 'incredibly', 'fast-paced', 'film', 'most', 'story', 'revealed', 'grunts', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Chev', 'Chellos', 'barrels', 'story', 'was', 'strangely', 'off', 'characters', 'were', 'more', 'bad', 'good', 'everyone', 'was', 'looking', 'out', 'himself.But', 'now', 'seeing', 'High', 'Voltage', 'am', 'wondering', 'am', 'remembering', 'first', 'film', 'too', 'fondly.Picking', 'up', 'where', 'last', 'film', 'ended', 'literally', 'watch', 'Chev', 'plane', 'car', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'street', 'guy', 'was', 'fighting', 'lands', 'pavement', 'nearby', 'dead', 'Chev', 'still', 'alive', 'barely', 'Then', 'van', 'up', 'bunch', 'Chinese', 'gang', 'members', 'pull', 'Chev', 'inside', 'Later', 'up', 'brothel', 'Chinese', 'doctors', 'standing', 'admiring', 'handiwork', 'have', 'removed', 'heart', 'replaced', 'artificial', 'model', 'battery', 'have', 'conveniently', 'strapped', 'chest', 'escape', 'soon', 'learns', 'constantly', 're-charge', 'battery', 'jumper', 'cables', 'like', 'tongue', 'also', 'find', 'Chinese', 'gang', 'leader', 'who', 'stole', 'heart', 'battle', 'way', 'streets', 'following', 'leads', 'working', 'towards', 'goal', 'group', 'Latino', 'gang', 'members', 'are', 'also', 'hunt', 'Chev', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'who', 'working', 'strip', 'club', 'part', 'ride', 'High', 'Voltage', 'waste', 'time', 'find', 'difficult', 'adequately', 'explain', 'why.And', 'really', 'am', 'beginning', 'wonder', 'what', 'found', 'so', ""'fun"", 'first', 'film.In', 'High', 'Voltage', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'time', 'explain', 'who', 'Chev', 'so', 'guess', 'are', 'assuming', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'entry', 'will', 'spend', 'money', 'see', 'second', 'installment', 'saga', 'Chelios', 'Honestly', 'forget', 'what', 'Chev', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'sat', 'there', 'watching', 'Statham', 'careen', 'one', 'set', 'bad', 'guys', 'another.Because', 'Statham', 'always', 'moving', 'impossible', 'do', 'anything', 'grunt', 'shout', 'When', 'new', 'artificial', 'heart', 'slow', 'down', 'groggy', 'few', 'seconds', 'new', 'source', 'electrical', 'current.Amy', 'Smart', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'entering', 'story', 'weakest', 'pretenses', 'hanging', 'Chev', 'arm', 'outrun', 'current', 'crop', 'bad', 'guys', 'then', 'disappears', 'popping', 'up', 'again', 'specific', 'reason.Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Capote', 'Sunshine', 'Cleaning', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'role', 'ludicrous', 'caricature', 'am', 'surprised', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Latino', 'Rights', 'groups', 'maybe', 'are', 'doing', 'smart', 'thing', 'standing', 'sidelines', 'letting', 'film', 'quick', 'death', 'were', 'protest', 'would', 'only', 'bring', 'attention', 'film', 'lengthen', 'life', 'piece', 'trash.Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'returns', 'Chev', 'friend', 'disgraced', 'doctor', 'who', 'Chev', 'navigate', 'treacherous', 'waters', 'newest', 'ailment', 'character', 'depraved', 'clearly', 'newfound', 'status', 'outcast', 'society', 'High', 'Voltage', 'much', 'time', 'licking', 'touching', 'caressing', 'near', 'naked', 'buttocks', 'African', 'American', 'prostitute.David', 'Carradine', 'also', 'appearance', 'Chinese', 'gang', 'boss', 'Honestly', 'appearance', 'more', 'laughable', 'anything', 'else', 'made', 'up', 'look', 'character', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'senior', 'citizen.Just', 'rehashing', 'left', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth.Consider', 'warned']",Crank 2 [Theatical Release] [Theatrical Release]

This is a one joke extended to a feature film, with Jason Statham as incredibly resilient hero who is desperately seeking his stolen heart.""Crank: High Voltage"" picks up where its predecessor left off. After making an aerial dive, our unstoppable hyper-masculine hero Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is abducted by Asian gangsters. Apparently they are working for someone who needs Chev's organs badly and they literally ""steal"" his heart, which is replaced by an artificial one.This means Chev has to move fast to retrieve his stolen heart before the battery runs out. In the first ""Crank"" Jason Statham's character had to stay alive by keeping his adrenaline level up. This time he must run and fight the gangsters while ""charging"" his body with electricity using whatever method and resources he can find.You can't really expect subtlety in films like ""Crank: High Voltage."" The over-the-top action comedy is unabashedly lewd, crude and violent. The jokes are often brutal, and cheerfully done, whether you like it or not. The supporting characters are vulgar including Dwight Yoakam as sleazy heart surgeon Doc Miles and Ling Bai playing a relentlessly noisy woman Ria who keeps chasing Chev. As to Jason Statham's hero, there is a ""skin-to-skin"" friction sequence in Hollywood Park, which results in the sex scene with Amy Smart's character, in the middle of the horse track (during the race).I don't mind silly, dirty jokes providing they are funny. The jokes in ""Crank: High Voltage"" are funny, I thought at first, but later they become tedious, as directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor tend to repeat the same material over and over again.

The movie just basically channels its strength from just how outrageous and over-the-top the scenes can get, it was basically a cartoonish display of violence and mayhem. I didn't exactly figure that writers/directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor would come up with a sequel considering the way ""Crank"" ended. Well, buckle up, fellas, Neveldine and Taylor have unleashed ""CRANK 2: High Voltage"" and it is definitely bigger, louder, sillier than the original film. This type of movie makes fun of itself and is NOT to be taken seriously. The film's ludicrous plot requires a VERY, VERY, VERY HUGE suspension of disbelief and requires a certain taste. I'd be lying if I didn't say that the film is loads of fun to watch and that it serves up a climax that is so outrageously unpredictable.The movie takes off after the events of ""Crank"" as we see killer-for-hire Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) splattered all over the sidewalk. He should have died right there, (the movie makes no attempts to explain why his body wasn't pulp) but his body was recovered by a Chinese triad so that they can transplant his ""strawberry tart"" (or heart) to their very elderly leader Poon Dong (seriously!). Chelios awakens to escape before the triad can harvest his other body parts and goes on a rampage to recover his natural life-giving pump; requiring a jolt of electricity for his artificial heart so that he can embark on his journey. Along the way, he runs into a spunky prostitute named Ria (Bai Ling), his ex-girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart) who is now a sexy stripper, dead friend Kaylo's brother Venus, all the while trying to avoid his former enemies...Complain all you want about the film's bad dialogue, abrasive hyper-kinetic cinematography, gratuitous nudity (even full frontal), racism and absurd plot devices, this film goes all out. It appears that the creators are all in to outdo the original and they succeed. Directors Neveldine and Taylor doesn't hold back and CRANK 2 does make the original appear like a Disney flick. Like the two filmmakers or not, Taylor and Neveldine does display some of the sensibilities that made Tarantino great; only instead of having a grand knowledge of cinema that references from other films of the past, the two is your kid-in-a-candy store whose passion for filmmaking stems from video games, Asian technological tricks, cartoonish caricatures that is not high art but more like a scribble on a sketch book. They don't have the Tarantino finesse or touch, but they make do with what they have and channels exactly what they want to express that is a movie built on lewd behavior, murder, violence, blood, gratuitous nudity and sex. The two ""Crank"" creators are nuts and their ideas are a hoot!The film is an on-screen video game complete with an 8-bit Nintendo score. ""Crank 2"" channels its energy from the absurd and the ridiculous. I don't have any idea as to what the crazy subtitles were all about. The writing of the film makes mayhem and debauchery its central focus and Statham and Amy Smart seemed to be very comfortable with their roles. I cannot really dissect the senseless, outrageous gimmicks the two filmmakers have cooked up because it is the film's main strengths; quite frankly the film makes the bare minimum of sense and it makes it its main draw. I wouldn't be surprised if they wrote up the story while they were drunk or they were severely over-caffeinated. (I mean this in a good way) I'll give you a few examples to whet your appetite, Statham and Smart has sex on a horse racing track while a horse leaps overhead showing his attributes, a stripper who gets shot in her implants, there are crazy scenes that channels ""Godzilla"" and ""They Saved Hitler`s Brain"". Whatever idea you can think of, ""Crank 2"" may just have it. Convoluted; yet so much fun.The film is a direct sequel and honestly, it seems like ""Crank 2"" is the same movie but with more guts to go to the limit. The majority of the characters in the film carry references to the first film and many of them return in the persons of Keone Young, Reno Wilson, Dwight Yoakam, Glenn Howerton, and in a way, Efren Ramirez who plays Kaylo's twin brother; they are easily recognizable as the viewer can easily connect the dots. Ramirez's character is definitely inspired that he has a crazy medical condition that I shouldn't reveal. Bai Ling plays a gutsy Chinese hooker and her character is no less outrageous as Ramirez's. She appears to be a sexy, creepy natural Bai Ling without her prozac. Cehv Chelios is the type of protagonist that I had no qualms in cheering on, because of his tough-fisted approach to any problem. It also helps when he has a girlfriend as sexy as Amy Smart. The film also remembers to pitch in a `mythic' mystery as to what is inside Johnny Vang's (played by Art Hsu) cooler. (ala-""Pulp Fiction"")""Crank 2: High Voltage"" isn't a great movie but it is definitely great for what it wants to be. One cannot help but give in to all the ridiculousness and silliness of the film's narrative (or close to a linear narrative as it can be). The film is all about revenge mixed in with chase elements, with the ""strawberry tart"" as the main objective. Like Neveldine or Taylor or not, you have to give the two guys their props and appreciate their talent for mayhem and visual manipulation. Despite the fact that they may not approach a true level of artistry and finesse, their rough, edgy and unique style has won me over. The film is a raw exercise of action, mayhem and sex that defies and denies all logic and laws of physics that can turn your brain into gooey matter. It is something that takes everything we've seen in the past and dresses it up as something very different. You will either love this film or hate it; there is just no halfway mark. If there's another sequel (there is a strong hint that there will be), I am pretty sure this time I would be all in.Recommended!
