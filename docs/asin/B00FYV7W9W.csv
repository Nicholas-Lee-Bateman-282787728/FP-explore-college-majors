1673727,AODG4NET5Q8QM,B00FYV7W9W,Adam J. Waters,"[0, 0]",From the director of Cube and Splice comes what is essentially a cool twist to the standard ghost haunting story. The twist this time is that it takes from the perspective of the ghost and her struggle to save the next girl and her family from dying in a similar fashion she did by someone who is already dead himself. Abigail Breslin gives a great performance and really carries this movie...with a lesser actress it would have been mediocre at best. A good pick up or rental for anyone looking for an interesting horror movie that is light on gore and has a few decent jump scares.,4,Interesting haunting story,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,583,"['director', 'Cube', 'Splice', 'what', 'essentially', 'cool', 'twist', 'standard', 'ghost', 'haunting', 'story', 'twist', 'time', 'perspective', 'ghost', 'struggle', 'save', 'next', 'girl', 'family', 'dying', 'similar', 'fashion', 'did', 'someone', 'who', 'already', 'dead', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'great', 'performance', 'really', 'movie', 'lesser', 'actress', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'mediocre', 'best', 'good', 'pick', 'up', 'rental', 'anyone', 'looking', 'interesting', 'horror', 'movie', 'light', 'gore', 'few', 'decent', 'jump', 'scares']",N/A

1673733,A1JZZLIVXGJSIB,B00FYV7W9W,CinemaMinor,"[0, 1]","I recently watched ""The Conjuring"" for the first time and was very disappointed.  Maybe it was because it was around Halloween and I'd just binged on horror movies, but I could not dismiss the movie's cliches the way other viewers/reviewers could. The bright spot about ""Haunter"" is that it actually tries to be original.  One, it relies on the story and not cheap thrills for its effectiveness; there are very few graphic images.  Two, it turns the table on traditional haunted house tales by making the ghosts the ones who are haunted.Abigail Breslin very nicely plays Lisa, a girl who must constantly relive the day before her 16th birthday in her family home with her parents and little brother.  Every day the four of them go through the same motions and engage in most of the same dialogue.  Only Lisa seems to be aware of this. Still, she doesn't know what happened to cause it, or how to change it. During Lisa's quest to unlock the mystery, she discovers that she and her family are not alone in the house.  Through her contact with ""the other side"" she manages to uncover the secrets the house holds and, despite dire warnings, sets out to free her family and break the cycle of haunting.Because the movie wins points for originality and storytelling, I'm not docking it for its flaws of which there are many, but none that aren't typical of the genre.  There are a lot of plot elements that don't make sense.  I can't delve deeply into them without giving too much away.  One issue is that the limits of what ghosts can and can't do and the plights that they're susceptible to are fluid throughout the movie.  Basically, because of the film's pretty original premise, it was able to make its own rules; unfortunately, they're more penciled in than in ink.There were also a few times when I wanted to fast forward.  The audience is clued in very early on -- in the first 10 minutes -- to the key plot point.  So then we, like Lisa and her family, are forced to go through the motions of reliving the same day over and over again.The ending is anticlimactic and because of the overall shortage of shocking images, it does seem a little simplistic -- like more of a made-for-TV movie than one that was made for the theatres. But I did watch it on my TV so that worked out okay.  I wasn't really ever ""scared"", although the movie is creepy at times.  To me, ""Haunter"" is at its core about the art of crafting a good ghost story, and in my opinion, the art of good storytelling is what's been missing from most horror movies lately that have scared me, but have relied on special effects and graphic images to do so.  It's a refreshing change of pace from the usual fare.",4,"Not all that scary, but a refreshing focus on storytelling",1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,2677,"['recently', 'watched', 'Conjuring', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Maybe', 'was', 'was', 'around', 'Halloween', ""'d"", 'just', 'binged', 'horror', 'movies', 'could', 'not', 'dismiss', 'movie', 'cliches', 'way', 'other', 'viewers/reviewers', 'could', 'bright', 'spot', 'Haunter', 'actually', 'be', 'original', 'One', 'story', 'not', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'effectiveness', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'graphic', 'images', 'Two', 'table', 'traditional', 'haunted', 'house', 'tales', 'making', 'ghosts', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'haunted.Abigail', 'Breslin', 'very', 'nicely', 'Lisa', 'girl', 'who', 'must', 'constantly', 'relive', 'day', '16th', 'birthday', 'family', 'home', 'parents', 'little', 'brother', 'day', 'four', 'go', 'same', 'motions', 'engage', 'most', 'same', 'dialogue', 'Only', 'Lisa', 'be', 'aware', 'Still', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'cause', 'how', 'change', 'Lisa', 'quest', 'unlock', 'mystery', 'family', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'house', 'contact', 'other', 'side', 'uncover', 'secrets', 'house', 'dire', 'warnings', 'out', 'free', 'family', 'break', 'cycle', 'haunting.Because', 'movie', 'points', 'originality', 'storytelling', ""'m"", 'not', 'docking', 'flaws', 'are', 'many', 'none', 'are', ""n't"", 'typical', 'genre', 'are', 'lot', 'plot', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'delve', 'deeply', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'One', 'issue', 'limits', 'what', 'ghosts', 'can', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'plights', ""'re"", 'susceptible', 'are', 'fluid', 'movie', 'Basically', 'film', 'pretty', 'original', 'premise', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'own', 'rules', 'unfortunately', ""'re"", 'more', 'penciled', 'ink.There', 'were', 'also', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'wanted', 'fast', 'forward', 'audience', 'clued', 'very', 'early', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'key', 'plot', 'point', 'So', 'then', 'Lisa', 'family', 'are', 'forced', 'go', 'motions', 'reliving', 'same', 'day', 'again.The', 'ending', 'anticlimactic', 'overall', 'shortage', 'shocking', 'images', 'seem', 'little', 'simplistic', 'more', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'one', 'was', 'made', 'theatres', 'did', 'watch', 'TV', 'so', 'worked', 'out', 'okay', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'ever', 'scared', 'movie', 'creepy', 'times', 'Haunter', 'core', 'art', 'crafting', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'opinion', 'art', 'good', 'storytelling', 'what', 'been', 'missing', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'lately', 'have', 'scared', 'have', 'relied', 'special', 'effects', 'graphic', 'images', 'do', 'so', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'usual', 'fare']",N/A

Abigail Breslin gives a nice performance as protagonist Lisa, as does Stephen McHattie as ""the Pale Man."" The remaining cast are also quite good. It's set in the mid 80s, which de-complicates things as there's no internet or text messages. The plot is simple but original, with some interesting twists and time paradoxes. I've noticed some comparisons of this film with ""The Others"" and certain others, but it's still quite different from many of the schlock-fests we're getting today. Still, it's low budget and a bit half-baked--to be fair, maybe 3/4-baked. I would have liked more specific revelations about the other families, victims, and the whole mythos behind the Pale Man, but oh well.HAUNTER is an interesting cross-blend of genres: It's something of a ""family horror film."" There is, however, some gore, death imagery, and generally disturbing, scary material, so it's not appropriate for really young children: Most preteens or older can probably handle it. Despite being pretty clean--nothing excessive in the areas mentioned, no nudity, some mild and realistic profanity--HAUNTER succeeds in being genuinely tense and frightening.

No. But it needs to be seen because it goes for creep and nuance as opposed to all out assault on the viewer's sensibilities.Here's the scoop. Lisa (Abigail Breslin) and her family are stuck in a loop but only she seems to know it. As far as her father, mother and brother are concerned, each day is a brand new day. So how is it she seems to be the only one who knows and can she do anything about it?This is a very watchable film. It has a creepy storyline and it's directed in such a way as to maintain the creep factor. The constant fog, the same people saying and doing the same things over and over, day after day is disconcerting. I liked that there were no jump scares used. This is more of a slow burn.  It does borrow a few things from other sources, but it's a smart dog who knows its owner so I can forgive it for that.But the clues build as to how all this came about and it has a satisfying ending.The acting is ranges from good to really good. Breslin is maturing as an actress and she's growing into her face. She doesn't look as gorpy as she did a few years ago.On the downside is the Stephen McHattie character. It's a bit overplayed. Too much the boogie man. Also, some of the framing techniques in a few shots, though good, were a bit overused. And some of the story aspects didn't fit for me.

In fact, I was confused because the writers keep saying the same thing over and over.  I asked myself, what am I missing?  Is there something going on here that I need to figure out before moving on?  Is there something ""otherworldly""? NO, NO & NO!  The writers simply needed to fill the allotted time frame.  Consequently, I feel like I watched this movie five times in a row instead of once all the way through! I held out hope for a surprise ending.  There wasn't one.To be crystal clear:  There are NO good parts. No twists or turns, no surprises, no jumps or screams, no cover your eyes, no blood, no gore, no, no, no....whatever you're looking for - you'll not find it here.  I'm not sure why this is classified as horror.Abigail Breslin's name caught my eye also and I don't mean to be cruel and won't harp on this.  I just wanted to tell her to go home, give it up...there is no saving this story - it's horrible.  I've seen Ms. Breslin in roles where she shines - this isn't one of those roles.I'm being extremely generous with my rating.FEB 2014 UPDATE:  Another reviewer referred to this movie as this genre's equivalent of GROUNDHOG DAY and I thought that was a perfect description....that is exactly how it seemed to me.",2,Honestly & Unfortunately ~ Haunter is Just OK,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,1427,"[""'m"", 'haunted', 'wish', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'watching', 'trailer', 'movie', 'looked', 'great', 'so', 'rented', 'whopping', '6.99', 'plot', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'smart', 'fact', 'was', 'confused', 'writers', 'keep', 'saying', 'same', 'thing', 'asked', 'what', 'am', 'missing', 'something', 'going', 'here', 'need', 'figure', 'out', 'moving', 'there', 'something', 'otherworldly', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'writers', 'simply', 'needed', 'fill', 'allotted', 'time', 'frame', 'Consequently', 'feel', 'watched', 'movie', 'five', 'times', 'row', 'instead', 'once', 'way', 'held', 'out', 'hope', 'surprise', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'one.To', 'be', 'crystal', 'clear', 'are', 'NO', 'good', 'parts', 'twists', 'turns', 'surprises', 'jumps', 'screams', 'cover', 'eyes', 'blood', 'gore', '.whatever', ""'re"", 'looking', ""'ll"", 'not', 'find', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'classified', 'horror.Abigail', 'Breslin', 'name', 'caught', 'eye', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'be', 'cruel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'harp', 'just', 'wanted', 'tell', 'go', 'home', 'give', 'up', 'saving', 'story', 'horrible', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ms.', 'Breslin', 'roles', 'where', ""n't"", 'one', 'roles.I', ""'m"", 'being', 'extremely', 'generous', 'rating.FEB', '2014', 'UPDATE', 'reviewer', 'referred', 'movie', 'genre', 'equivalent', 'GROUNDHOG', 'DAY', 'thought', 'was', 'perfect', 'description', '.that', 'exactly', 'how', 'seemed']",N/A

Entertaining supernatural thriller never quite lives up to the promise of its set-up--as the title suggests it's a ghost story, but one in which the heroine and her family are all ghosts, although she is the only one who realizes it.  Eventually she begins to unravel the mystery of how her family ended up like they are and begins communicating with a living girl who lives in the same house and whose family may meet the same fate that hers did unless she can stop a murderer who is no longer alive.  Abigail Breslin is an immensely likable actress which makes it easy to root for her even though the script is only so so--the movie is never really as suspenseful as it could have been and a stronger relationship between the ghost and the living girl she is trying to save also would have been nice.

On an inordinately foggy day we meet Lisa (Abigail Breslin).  In many ways Lisa is the prototypical American teen--moody, attitudinal, and her parents just don't get her.  But in one way she's not like the typical teen: she and her family are reliving the same day of their life over and over again and Lisa is the only one who sees what's happening or has any idea why.Creative shots illustrate the seclusion of their house in the fog and their boringly repetitive life/day.  The same mac and cheese for lunch--every day, the same conversation with her mother--every day, the same episode of Murder She Wrote every night--every day&#8230; this Groundhog Day  scenario has been wearing on Lisa's patience and sanity alike.  But one day strange things start happening around the house and Lisa's angsty teen life becomes a little more interesting.Slamming doors, strange sounds, voices, shadows and secret doors; it seems that Lisa's house is haunted and only Lisa knows it.  But there's something very different about this haunting&#8230;To say much more would ruin this movie and, honestly, most reviews and trailers risk giving away the well-crafted surprises that makes this story so original.The scares are hardly as &#34;scary&#34; as your typical jump scares--hardly startling to the seasoned horrorhound making it feel very much the humble PG-13 that it is.  I'd go so far as to call this movie family-friendly.  There is also no gore, nudity or profanity.  This film relies entirely on Lisa's perception and the surreal storytelling that ebbs and flows around her.Director Vincenzo Natali (Cube, Splice) does a fine job here making a more &#34;wholesome&#34; horror film, but I feel that this entry to the genre will be lost on most mature horror-goers unless they're looking for something non-Disney to watch with their kids.  Natali has had a lot of experience as a storyboard artist (Ginger Snaps, Johnny Mnemonic, Eek the Cat and the Beetlejuice cartoon, to name the freaky and oddball work) and his mind is designed to form twisted, weird, slapstick, moral-testing, brutal scenarios.  I applaud this work and respect it.  However, I look forward to his future endeavors aimed more for lovers of gore, tension and, well, &#34;horror.&#34;",4,"An original haunting mingling teen angst, family-friendly horror and surreal storytelling",1392595200,"02 17, 2014",2014,2530,"['adult', 'horrorhound', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'satisfying', 'teen', 'angst', 'meets', 'PG-13', 'family-friendly', 'horror', 'cleverly', 'surreal', 'storytelling', 'highly', 'original', 'film.This', 'film', 'too', 'familiar', 'idea', 'i.e.', 'haunted', 'house', 'story', 'new', 'perspective', 'inordinately', 'foggy', 'day', 'meet', 'Lisa', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'many', 'ways', 'Lisa', 'prototypical', 'American', 'teen', 'moody', 'attitudinal', 'parents', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'way', 'not', 'typical', 'teen', 'family', 'are', 'reliving', 'same', 'day', 'life', 'over', 'again', 'Lisa', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'what', 'happening', 'idea', 'why.Creative', 'shots', 'illustrate', 'seclusion', 'house', 'fog', 'boringly', 'repetitive', 'life/day', 'same', 'mac', 'cheese', 'lunch', 'day', 'same', 'conversation', 'mother', 'day', 'same', 'episode', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'night', 'day', '8230', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'scenario', 'been', 'wearing', 'Lisa', 'patience', 'sanity', 'alike', 'one', 'day', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'house', 'Lisa', 'angsty', 'teen', 'life', 'little', 'more', 'interesting.Slamming', 'doors', 'strange', 'sounds', 'voices', 'shadows', 'secret', 'doors', 'Lisa', 'house', 'haunted', 'only', 'Lisa', 'something', 'very', 'different', 'haunting', '8230', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'would', 'ruin', 'movie', 'honestly', 'most', 'reviews', 'trailers', 'risk', 'giving', 'away', 'well-crafted', 'surprises', 'story', 'so', 'original.The', 'scares', 'are', 'hardly', '34', 'scary', '34', 'typical', 'jump', 'scares', 'hardly', 'startling', 'seasoned', 'horrorhound', 'making', 'feel', 'very', 'much', 'humble', 'PG-13', ""'d"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'call', 'movie', 'family-friendly', 'also', 'gore', 'nudity', 'profanity', 'film', 'entirely', 'Lisa', 'perception', 'surreal', 'storytelling', 'ebbs', 'around', 'her.Director', 'Vincenzo', 'Natali', 'Cube', 'Splice', 'fine', 'job', 'here', 'making', 'more', '34', 'wholesome', '34', 'horror', 'film', 'feel', 'entry', 'genre', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'most', 'mature', 'horror-goers', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'non-Disney', 'watch', 'kids', 'Natali', 'had', 'lot', 'experience', 'storyboard', 'artist', 'Ginger', 'Snaps', 'Johnny', 'Mnemonic', 'Eek', 'Cat', 'Beetlejuice', 'cartoon', 'name', 'freaky', 'oddball', 'work', 'mind', 'designed', 'form', 'twisted', 'weird', 'slapstick', 'moral-testing', 'brutal', 'scenarios', 'applaud', 'work', 'respect', 'However', 'look', 'forward', 'future', 'endeavors', 'aimed', 'more', 'lovers', 'gore', 'tension', 'well', '34', 'horror.', '34']",N/A

She's finding herself waking up everyday to the same thing. The film centers around her and her parents, and her little brother who as she uncovers things, realizes a secret they have not figured out yet. Without trying to give too much away, she ends up finding a way to communicate with a girl from the past, and another from the future. However, don't think Back To The Future or anything, it's not about time traveling. That will make some sense if you have seen the film. In order for things to turn out for the best, she has to find out what is going on, and who is behind it?There are parts of this movie that are pretty confusing, but by the time it's finished, everything comes together and makes sense... sort of. There are plenty of questions left to ask, but I won't go into them by mentioning them here, as they would be spoilers.What isn't a spoiler is saying the way you expect the film to go in, doesn't quite go there, and perhaps thats why there is quite a lot of negative votes and reviews about this film. So much of it either doesn't make sense, or it's creating it's own film laws that people have seen so many times in other movies and feel this one's laws it's creating are going against previous ones that stood out well.It's an odd tale... but it's in no way a horror film. It's more just a bit of a thriller, but more along the lines of a spooky ... kids movie? It also reminded me a bit of a few PG rated ghost shows of the past. Horror and gore fans will have absolutely no interest in this, unless you kind of want to see a really out there re-telling of Freddy Kruger?In the end, I didn't hate it, but I did not like it either. It's somewhere in between. It's filmed well, the effects are ok, the acting is alright, there is nothing really say against the production of the film... it's just, not a strong enough story to make me want to ever see it again. It's not a keeper. It's a rental/dl, see it once, and so be it. There is little to nothing much memorable or would be considered something added to classic moments in cinema.

1673767,A277UC8WJVAIIE,B00FYV7W9W,The Wiz,"[3, 5]","This film from Copperheart Entertainment (""Giinger Snaps"", ""Splice"") represents a clever variation on the haunted house theme edging a bit closer to psychological thriller than paranormal horror. Directed by Vincenzo Natali (""Splice""), Haunter possesses both the creative advantage of indie horror but with the look and feel of a big studio and although definitely not a popcorn flick may just provoke a little refection.The story [marginal spoilers included]: Every day begins with the protagonist (Lisa) waking up in a sticky-sweet, middle-class, late-80's time loop until one afternoon, upon seeing a mysterious apparition, she decides to explore the spooky attic. There she discovers a Ouija board and begins a little paranormal investigation of her own, but increased snooping leads to the daily routine beginning to alter in disturbing ways eventually resulting in a visitation from a foreboding repairman. Undaunted by the visitor and his mysterious threats, Lisa decides to take the tiger by the tail and bust out of the rut causing an already strange situation to devolve into borderline madness.The central character played by Abigail Breslin (""Little Miss Sunshine"", ""Zombieland"", ""Ender's Game"") does an excellent job at convincing us she's a frustrated teen trying to cope with a nerve-wrackingly bizarre situation. This movie either succeeds or fails based on her performance as there are really no other remarkable characters (other than the creepy repairman/villain), however Stargate fans will enjoy the, albeit brief, appearance of David Hewlett.A foggy, house-bound setting filmed in warm colors adds to the moody atmosphere marked by a thematic crossing of sub-genres from quirky paranormal to more survival horror, dotted with light doses of humor and including occasional strokes of subtle brilliance such as a recurring selection from Prokofiev's ""Peter & the Wolf"". Although Haunter doesn't start terribly scary, the creepy factor ramps up about halfway through; it's very suspense-laden and absolutely not predictable and maybe even straddles the fence between an intellectually stimulating plot and slightly convoluted, but for me it has a relatively low rewatchability factor (except to try and understand what happened a little better) which definitely figures into my overall score.Be aware that there's absolutely nothing cheesy or low-budget about this surprisingly PG film, factors which distinguish it from about 50% of the genre, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend giving this one a rent; however for me this films' greatest weakness reflects a growing trend in horror for parting the veil of supernatural mystery just a bit too far and in so doing, ironically dialing back the potential for legitimate scares. There's something inherently terrifying about the unknown and when writers attempt to creatively offer explanations, the creepy becomes mundane and at an intuitive level we just don't buy it. :o)",3,Don't Fear the Repairman,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,2942,"['film', 'Copperheart', 'Entertainment', 'Giinger', 'Snaps', 'Splice', 'clever', 'variation', 'haunted', 'house', 'theme', 'edging', 'bit', 'closer', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'paranormal', 'horror', 'Directed', 'Vincenzo', 'Natali', 'Splice', 'Haunter', 'creative', 'advantage', 'indie', 'horror', 'look', 'feel', 'big', 'studio', 'definitely', 'not', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'may', 'just', 'provoke', 'little', 'refection.The', 'story', '[', 'marginal', 'spoilers', 'included', ']', 'day', 'protagonist', 'Lisa', 'waking', 'up', 'sticky-sweet', 'middle-class', 'late-80', 'time', 'loop', 'one', 'afternoon', 'seeing', 'mysterious', 'apparition', 'explore', 'spooky', 'attic', 'Ouija', 'board', 'little', 'paranormal', 'investigation', 'own', 'increased', 'snooping', 'leads', 'daily', 'routine', 'beginning', 'alter', 'disturbing', 'ways', 'eventually', 'resulting', 'visitation', 'foreboding', 'repairman', 'Undaunted', 'visitor', 'mysterious', 'threats', 'Lisa', 'take', 'tiger', 'tail', 'bust', 'rut', 'causing', 'already', 'strange', 'situation', 'devolve', 'borderline', 'madness.The', 'central', 'character', 'played', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Zombieland', 'Ender', 'Game', 'excellent', 'job', 'convincing', 'frustrated', 'teen', 'trying', 'cope', 'nerve-wrackingly', 'bizarre', 'situation', 'movie', 'fails', 'based', 'performance', 'are', 'really', 'other', 'remarkable', 'characters', 'other', 'creepy', 'repairman/villain', 'however', 'Stargate', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'albeit', 'brief', 'appearance', 'David', 'Hewlett.A', 'foggy', 'house-bound', 'setting', 'filmed', 'warm', 'colors', 'moody', 'atmosphere', 'marked', 'thematic', 'crossing', 'sub-genres', 'quirky', 'paranormal', 'more', 'survival', 'horror', 'dotted', 'light', 'doses', 'humor', 'including', 'occasional', 'strokes', 'subtle', 'brilliance', 'such', 'recurring', 'selection', 'Prokofiev', 'Peter', 'Wolf', 'Haunter', ""n't"", 'start', 'terribly', 'scary', 'creepy', 'factor', 'up', 'about', 'halfway', 'very', 'suspense-laden', 'absolutely', 'not', 'predictable', 'maybe', 'even', 'fence', 'intellectually', 'stimulating', 'plot', 'slightly', 'convoluted', 'relatively', 'low', 'rewatchability', 'factor', 'try', 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'little', 'better', 'definitely', 'overall', 'score.Be', 'aware', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'cheesy', 'low-budget', 'surprisingly', 'PG', 'film', 'factors', 'distinguish', '50', '%', 'genre', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'giving', 'one', 'rent', 'however', 'films', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'growing', 'trend', 'horror', 'parting', 'veil', 'supernatural', 'mystery', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'so', 'doing', 'ironically', 'dialing', 'back', 'potential', 'legitimate', 'scares', 'something', 'inherently', 'terrifying', 'unknown', 'when', 'writers', 'attempt', 'creatively', 'offer', 'explanations', 'creepy', 'mundane', 'intuitive', 'level', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'o']",N/A

These type movies are generally lacking in the areas that matter the most, acting and writing, even if the underlying premise is pretty good.&#34;The Conjuring&#34; relies upon a premise that has been done to death. A family moves into a home possessed by an evil spirit and they must rid the home of the entity. &#34;Haunter&#34; takes a new twist on this type story and does a fairly decent job. Although the movie has an overall surreal effect that leaves the viewer in a somewhat confused daze, it continues to remain interesting. After this surreal effects dissipates, the movie becomes more of a thriller.The acting, especially by the lead actress Abigail Breslin, is well done. Again, a rarity in these type movies.Trying to write a movie like this, bringing multiple stories/phases/realities/whatever is not easy. This movie does ok in that department. At times I think the writing slagged and suffered a bit but it did not drag out. Overall, everything came together well.No real special effects for this movie. This movie relies upon storytelling and acting. Audio and filming are excellent.Family friendly: No nudity, no foul language. Murder is observed but not gruesome. I think the most unfriendly family parts would be the anger scenes but they are not too bad. This movie is ok to watch with young kids in the room, in my opinion,This is not a scary movie but a nice Halloween selection for adults wanting a more quality type movie. &#34;The Conjuring&#34; is also a quality selection.Normally, I would rate this movie with 3 stars, but because it rises above its class in genre and the makers seemed to care about the movie in general, it gets 4 stars.",4,A new trend in scary movies?

She is a force to be reckoned with for her future in film. It wasn't too shabby a ghost story either. I think the editing alone makes this film unsettling and worth your time. Who is haunting who is the question?
