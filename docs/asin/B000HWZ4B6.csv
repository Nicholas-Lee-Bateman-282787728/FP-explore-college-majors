1016662,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B000HWZ4B6,A. Gammill,"[5, 7]","You know, I really had no problem with Lois and Clark getting together.  This started with the season 3 premiere, and, like the overall series itself, was handled with a light touch.  But after waiting for the wedding (and being led on by the regrettable ""on again/off again"" story arc in the previous season), the Big Moment was really a letdown.  I won't spoil the details for those who haven't seen it, but I think only the most undemanding of fans will be satisfied by the route the writers take.The rest of Season 4 is decidedly hit and miss.  Howie Mandel makes for a fun Myxzptlk, sending Metropolis into an eerie time loop at Christmastime.  And the resolution to last season's Kryptonian story arc is a treat, as super-powered villains lay waste to Smallville.  On the downside, other guest-stars like Grant Shaud and Harry Anderson are wasted in dumb roles.  Even return visits by Tempus only serve to remind one of how much fun the character was in the beginning.As usual, Cain and Hatcher do their best; indeed, it's their chemistry that makes even the lesser episodes (and there are many) bearable.  Still, I can't help but wonder: If the writers had been allowed to keep them apart (romantically speaking) awhile longer, would the show have been able to keep the magic the made the first 2 seasons so much fun?",3,The Moonlighting Curse...stronger than Kryptonite?,1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,1324,"['know', 'really', 'had', 'problem', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'getting', 'together', 'started', 'season', '3', 'premiere', 'overall', 'series', 'was', 'handled', 'light', 'touch', 'waiting', 'wedding', 'being', 'led', 'regrettable', 'again/off', 'again', 'story', 'arc', 'previous', 'season', 'Big', 'Moment', 'was', 'really', 'letdown', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'details', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'think', 'only', 'most', 'undemanding', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied', 'route', 'writers', 'take.The', 'rest', 'Season', '4', 'decidedly', 'hit', 'miss', 'Howie', 'Mandel', 'fun', 'Myxzptlk', 'sending', 'Metropolis', 'eerie', 'time', 'loop', 'Christmastime', 'resolution', 'last', 'season', 'Kryptonian', 'story', 'arc', 'treat', 'super-powered', 'villains', 'lay', 'waste', 'Smallville', 'downside', 'other', 'guest-stars', 'Grant', 'Shaud', 'Harry', 'Anderson', 'are', 'wasted', 'dumb', 'roles', 'Even', 'return', 'visits', 'Tempus', 'only', 'serve', 'remind', 'one', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'character', 'was', 'beginning.As', 'usual', 'Cain', 'Hatcher', 'do', 'best', 'indeed', 'chemistry', 'even', 'lesser', 'episodes', 'are', 'many', 'bearable', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'writers', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'keep', 'apart', 'romantically', 'speaking', 'awhile', 'longer', 'would', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'keep', 'magic', 'made', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'so', 'much', 'fun']",N/A

It was campy at times, and had some great sci fi moments as well.  To give an expample of how campy it was, Adam West and Frank Gorshin (Batman and the Riddler from the 60s Batman TV show) appeared in one episode, as did the Jeffersons, a.k.a. Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford (in different roles).  I liked multi part storyline where Clark is almost forced into a marriage with another Kryptonian, and the whole thing starts to play like Superman II where some bad kryptonians try to take over Earth.  The kryptonian he almost married was played by Justine Bateman, a.k.a. Mallory Keaton from Family Ties.  And who can forget when Scott Valentine, a.k.a. Nick (Mallory's boyfriend) on Family Ties, played Metallo.  Pure camp.  And speaking again of Smallville, Dean Cain did a guest appearance on that show (season 7) as Curtis Knox, an evil doctor who cures metor freaks by killing them.  Dean is a good actor.  It was a brilliant idea to give him the role of a villian on Smallville.  It plays against his Lois and Clark role.",5,A Super Show,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,1117,"['second', 'greatest', 'Superman', 'related', 'show', 'Smallville', 'being', 'first', 'was', 'campy', 'times', 'had', 'great', 'sci', 'fi', 'moments', 'well', 'give', 'expample', 'how', 'campy', 'was', 'Adam', 'West', 'Frank', 'Gorshin', 'Batman', 'Riddler', '60s', 'Batman', 'TV', 'show', 'appeared', 'one', 'episode', 'did', 'Jeffersons', 'a.k.a', 'Sherman', 'Hemsley', 'Isabel', 'Sanford', 'different', 'roles', 'liked', 'multi', 'part', 'storyline', 'where', 'Clark', 'almost', 'forced', 'marriage', 'Kryptonian', 'whole', 'thing', 'play', 'Superman', 'II', 'where', 'bad', 'kryptonians', 'try', 'take', 'over', 'Earth', 'kryptonian', 'almost', 'married', 'was', 'played', 'Justine', 'Bateman', 'a.k.a', 'Mallory', 'Keaton', 'Family', 'Ties', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'when', 'Scott', 'Valentine', 'a.k.a', 'Nick', 'Mallory', 'boyfriend', 'Family', 'Ties', 'played', 'Metallo', 'Pure', 'camp', 'speaking', 'again', 'Smallville', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'did', 'guest', 'appearance', 'show', 'season', '7', 'Curtis', 'Knox', 'evil', 'doctor', 'who', 'metor', 'freaks', 'killing', 'Dean', 'good', 'actor', 'was', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'give', 'role', 'villian', 'Smallville', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'role']",N/A

1016666,A1XACK4QK1K3P2,B000HWZ4B6,Amazon Customer,"[75, 82]","I agree with Robert Moore, but disagree at the same time. I was a viewer who wanted them married, and enjoyed them married. I loved the rapport between the characters, as well as the support, trust and respect that Lois and Clark shared. I loved all the touches, the looks, the kisses, and even those dull married couple moments.... why? Because Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain sold Lois & Clark as a couple very well. The chemistry was off the charts. You'd think the two were actually dating in real life, the chemistry was so good!And even though I only got 4 seasons, they made for better tv than a majority of the shows on tv now. Smallville doesn't even compare to Lois & Clark. I think Dean Cain made a wonderful Superman and an even better Clark Kent than Christoper Reeve (God rest his soul) and Teri Hatcher is byfar the best Lois Lane. The acting alone kept me tuning in.I agree that the writing wasn't as great as previous seasons, but like Robert Moore said, there are still episodes to enjoy. Some favorites of mine in season 4 are Stop The Presses, Sex, Lies, and Videotape, Lethal Weapon, The People vs. Lois Lane, and Dead Lois Walking.And what I love the most about season 4 is going back to seasons 1 and 2 and watching how the relationship evolved. Lois and Clark went from competitors, to partners, to friends, to finally lovers. It's beautiful to see how far they came.And in retrospect, it may have been rushed, but was wonderful to watch. I enjoyed the adventures, the villains, and the supporting cast of the show, and especially the beautiful Teri Hatcher and very handsome Dean Cain in their prime. I'll forever be grateful to Deborah Joy Levine for creating one of the best romantic comedy shows on television. I enjoyed seeing Clark Kent being the true personality and Superman being the secret identity.These were good times, man.

1016668,AB0GGIQBNB36Q,B000HWZ4B6,Ben Milton,"[3, 4]","I disagree with some people's assesment of season four, saying it was because they got married. That's not why it got cancelled, or why people quit watching. It was because the writers got sloppy, and didn't write the married couple as well as they wrote them as a dating couple, and the surrounding stories sucked. This season opens up with a two part episode, Lord Nor comes to earth to kill Kal-El. But he likes the fact that he has super powers here on earth, so he wants to take over the world. Meanwhile, Kal-El and His bride Zara are on their way to New Krypton, when they get the news that Lord Nor is on earth. Ooops, back to earth we go. AND THERE IS A BATTLE FOR SMALLVILLE, well a small skirmish really. But there is a duel between Superman and Lord Nor,  Superman wins. Now comes the wedding episode, which would have been okay. Had they left Delta Birk's Wedding Destroyer out of it, which unfortunately makes it a lame episode. And now season four settles in for  alot, and I mean aaaaaaaaaalot of moments of Clark really serious telling Lois that he's not going anywhere, or Lois doing the same thing. Now I do tell my wife that I love her, but I don't have to tell her every five minutes that we're in this together. She knows because we trust each other, and I'm always there. Season four just sinks and sinks, even when Lois is framed for murder. That's been done before, It's almost like the writers said, well there married now what. The two episodes with Tempus are weak, No. People didn't quit watching because they got married, they quit watching because the writers, producers, and actors quit caring. If you invest as much time into the characters as a married couple, that you did when they were single you could have more seasons.

The last two episodes ""Toy Story"" and ""The Family Hour"" were great. I am not saying I like all the episodes, but most of them were great. I think ""Soul Mates"" was my favorite.I didn't like ""Stop the Presses"" at all. Being an editor went to Lois' head. Superman almost died because of her swelled head and her inability to listen to anyone but herself. The only other episodes I didn't like were Faster than a Speeding Vixen, Shadow of Doubt, and Voice From the Past. I would have ended the series different. On the 3rd season I would have kept ""Double Jeopardy"" and ""Seconds"" done away with Forget Me Not"" and Oedipus"". I would have had ""Lord of the Flys"" and ""Battleground Earth"" the last two episodes of season 3. That would leave 2 extra episode at the end of Season 4. I would have had a whole episode of where the baby came from and with the last episdode as closure with everybody on Earth finding out Clark is Superman and the baby getting kidnapped. The whole episode could have revolved around finding the baby and dealing with Sam, Ellen, Lucy, Perry and Jimmy's anger. The end could have been Lois and Clark finding the baby and Sam, Ellen, Lucy, Perry, and Jimmy coming around and stop being mad at Lois and Clark. If there was a 5th season the first episode could be Lois, clark, and Dr. Klein finding a way to brainwash everyone into forgetting except Jonathan, Martha and Dr. Klein. If Tempus could brainwash everyone into electing him president and if Sam, Ellen, Sam's assistant and Fathead brainwashed into forgetting Dr. Klein should be able to find a way to make everyone forget Clark is Superman.

Those are, in my opinion, the stinker episodes. So much for that.Now, on to the good stuff, of which there is plenty. Season 4 continues where Season 3 left off, a cliff-hanger where Superman has to fly to New Krypton to avoid an interplanetary invasion and possible war by a band of rogues led by the heretofore mysterious (and faceless) Lord Nor. The fun continues in the thrilling II-part conclusion to the storyline. There's a nice connection to New World Zorro, which was unfortunately cancelled the previous year after a shocking episode that ended on a cliff-hanger when one of the main production companies pulled out with a lame excuse, thereby forcing production on the successful series to end (and leaving many of us ie-hard Zorro fans angry that the series would never show Zorro revealing his secret identity to his loved ones). But, as usual, I digress. The fun includes an exciting episode featuring The Wedding Destroyer, a dramatic II-part storyline where Lois is accused of murder, and an intriguing III-part episode where high-ranking businessmen vanish without a trace. There is also a science-fiction connection, where a future Terminator appears in a delicious episode. I shan't say more, lest I spoil the surprise(s), save for this: shame the future Terminator was not reactivated for future episodes.My one quibble, though, is: Why did they replace the actor playing Lieutenant Chang in the final 2 episodes of Season 3 (Jon Tenney) and go with another actor playing the same part who barely had any lines? Same thing with replacing David Warner as Jor-El from Season 1 and going with another actor playing Jor-El in Season 3. Why do that?Final analysis: It was a really crappy move by ABC to cancel this series after 22 episodes in the fourth season, leaving us on a (perpetual) cliff-hanger. I know, declining ratings. But I don't see why the ratings for the series began falling. Evidently, the show was still going strong (in my opinion), and was definitely setting up for another season, or two...or three. Clearly not a smart idea., ABC Either way, we still have the four seasons of this excellent series to enjoy.

Connor ""dragonsandsuch""","[3, 5]","I had to drop this season a star from what I'd give the others.I disagree with the posters who think their marriage (and the end of the ""will they won't they"" tension) was the downfall of the show. I personally think they spaced the development of the relationship perfectly (there is only so long that you can drag out the ""will they won't they"" before it just becomes tedious).That being said, I thought that this season had far too many overly serious ""I love you, Lois"" moments between Clark and Lois. The writers seemed to me to be trying far too hard to convey how much they love each other that their relationship lost the playful quality it had in previous seasons. When they were playful, it always seemed sexually related (which resulted in scenes that I'd rather not have my kids watching).Also (spoiler alert), I thought the first 4 episodes were some of the worst of the entire series.1&2: I did not like the Kryptonian episodes for a number of reasons. The first and foremost that Superman would be subjugating himself to Kryptonian law, both while on Earth and while Lord Nor is murdering people. Second, the duel in which the oversized Q-tips were used. Why would these things be delivering such a punch to Superman? They were designed to be used on new-Krypton, were the Kryptonians are no more powerful than your standard Earthling. Are they originally designed to turn the loser into a thin red mist? (If it turned out humans had super powers on another planet, would pistols at twenty paces be all that effective?) Their super powers should have been the deciding factor, in which Superman (being more accustomed to them and absorbing more energy) should have easily won. Lastly, the small follow-up that the Colonel who used the kryptonite rocket was arrested. For what? For killing invading aliens when the only other hope for his country, Superman, was already defeated at their feet?3: The wedding. I just could not stomach that generic god-like ""Mike"" (obviously an attempt to add some sort of religious element to the wedding without offending anyone).4. While I liked all the other Tempus episodes (Tempus is just a fun, over-the-top villain that makes - usually - a great episode, even if you have to take that annoying H.G. Wells character along in the mix), this particular one was painful to watch.I did enjoy the rest of the episodes (well, with the exception of the ghost one). The final was not great, but not as bad as it could have been, given that the promised 5th season was yanked out from under them. I personally would have preferred it end with Lois finding out she's pregnant, despite all the tests, instead of the appearance of the mystery baby.Lastly, on a shallow note, I hated the short hair look Lois is sporting this season (and half of last).",3,"Though still good, more ""bad"" elements than previous",1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,2792,"['had', 'drop', 'season', 'star', 'what', ""'d"", 'give', 'others.I', 'disagree', 'posters', 'who', 'think', 'marriage', 'end', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tension', 'was', 'downfall', 'show', 'personally', 'think', 'spaced', 'development', 'relationship', 'perfectly', 'only', 'so', 'long', 'can', 'drag', 'out', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'just', 'becomes', 'tedious', '.That', 'being', 'said', 'thought', 'season', 'had', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'overly', 'serious', 'love', 'Lois', 'moments', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'writers', 'seemed', 'be', 'trying', 'far', 'too', 'hard', 'convey', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'other', 'relationship', 'lost', 'playful', 'quality', 'had', 'previous', 'seasons', 'When', 'were', 'playful', 'always', 'seemed', 'sexually', 'related', 'resulted', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'have', 'kids', 'watching', '.Also', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'thought', 'first', '4', 'episodes', 'were', 'worst', 'entire', 'series.1', '2', 'did', 'not', 'Kryptonian', 'number', 'reasons', 'first', 'foremost', 'Superman', 'would', 'be', 'subjugating', 'Kryptonian', 'law', 'Earth', 'Lord', 'Nor', 'murdering', 'people', 'Second', 'duel', 'oversized', 'Q-tips', 'were', 'used', 'Why', 'would', 'things', 'be', 'delivering', 'such', 'punch', 'Superman', 'were', 'designed', 'be', 'used', 'new-Krypton', 'were', 'Kryptonians', 'are', 'more', 'powerful', 'standard', 'Earthling', 'Are', 'originally', 'designed', 'turn', 'loser', 'thin', 'red', 'mist', 'turned', 'out', 'humans', 'had', 'super', 'powers', 'planet', 'would', 'pistols', 'twenty', 'paces', 'be', 'effective', 'super', 'powers', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'deciding', 'factor', 'Superman', 'being', 'more', 'accustomed', 'absorbing', 'more', 'energy', 'should', 'have', 'easily', 'won', 'Lastly', 'small', 'follow-up', 'Colonel', 'who', 'used', 'kryptonite', 'rocket', 'was', 'arrested', 'what', 'killing', 'invading', 'aliens', 'when', 'only', 'other', 'hope', 'country', 'Superman', 'was', 'already', 'defeated', 'feet', '3', 'wedding', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'stomach', 'generic', 'god-like', 'Mike', 'obviously', 'attempt', 'add', 'sort', 'religious', 'element', 'wedding', 'offending', 'anyone', '.4', 'liked', 'other', 'Tempus', 'episodes', 'Tempus', 'just', 'fun', 'over-the-top', 'villain', 'usually', 'great', 'episode', 'even', 'have', 'take', 'annoying', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'character', 'along', 'mix', 'particular', 'one', 'was', 'painful', 'watch.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'rest', 'episodes', 'well', 'exception', 'ghost', 'one', 'final', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'promised', '5th', 'season', 'was', 'yanked', 'out', 'personally', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'end', 'Lois', 'finding', 'out', 'pregnant', 'tests', 'instead', 'appearance', 'mystery', 'baby.Lastly', 'shallow', 'note', 'hated', 'short', 'hair', 'look', 'Lois', 'sporting', 'season', 'half', 'last']",N/A

Now I understand some fans had a problem with the show after they got married saying that the drama was gone and bad plots etc. Well IMO those people couldn't be more wrong. I was a fan of the show from the very begining I was 11 when the show first premired and never missed an episode. I grew up on every little drama and peril they always seemed to find themselves in and really wanted to kill that DEA agent. When Clark proposed i found myselef counting the days till i could hear the answer, and loved the direction season 3 took with them desperatly trying to stay together and the conceren of Supermans enemies finding out the truth and even loved the whole Clone arc. I felt the same way for the season 3 finale as I did season 2 and couldn't wait for season 4. I wasn't disapointed. I loved every moment and was very excited to see them deal with the trials and tribulations of a married couple. I don't see that the show declined one bit after they got married. I among others were extremly ticked when abc yanked the show without even showing the final episodes till like six months later. I know alot of fans don't like the ending but I think it was the perfect way to end the show and I wouldn't have it any other way.

We traveled with them  back in time with H.G. Wells to fix a curse that would have affected their marriage but before there was a chance for them to begin adjusting to their new status as Mr. and Mrs., Lois was set up and framed for murder. And that was just for starters.The rest of the season followed the intrepid reporters and newlyweds through their first year of marriage and all the adjustments that it requires. It also gave us more insight into who Superman was and how much Clark still didn't know about his Kryptonian heritage.The feel of the fourth season was different from the previous three. Not because the writing wasn't as good (for the most part), but because Lois and Clark were different.

As it had from the 2nd season on it followed the villain of the week format, and as was the case some of the episodes worked and others fell flat.  This season ended the will they or wont they stories that dominated the second and third season.  It picks up after the cliffhanger that ended season 3 and resolved the kryptonian invasion storyline quickly.  They then get married (for real) and the rest of the show really revolves around their relationship as a married couple.The best episodes of the 4th season were the ones which brought back the wonderful Lane Davies as Tempus.  Since the decision was made to ultimately write Lex Luthor off the show, Tempus became the main recurring villain in the show.  Unfortunately some of the other episodes (like those involving Lex's kids) did not work anywhere near as well.  By the end of the 4th season they were really running out of stories to tell, especially involving the supporting characters and it was probably time to end the series.  The one unfortunate thing however is that the series never did get a proper finale because the network had not made a decision on the show's fate by the end of the season.

The show was on for four seasons from 1993-1997. What made this show so special was the great chemistry Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher (Susan on Desperate Houswives) had on screen along with a great supporting cast. I was a huge fan watching the first episode in the fall of 1993 (I was 16 years old) and never missed an episode. When the last episode aired in 1997 (I was 20 years old) I was sad because like so many other reviewers I grew up with this show and it was a huge part of my life. I remember every Sunday night I would look so forward to seeing Lois & Clark. Me and my best friend Maria would talk about the show the next day and say how we had so many similarities to these characters. I think it is great that after years of the fans asking Warner Brothers to release this great show that they have finally listened. The fans truly do deserve a DVD release of all four seasons of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. This show means so much to so many people because it was a good show that lasted longer than anyone ever imagined it would. The fourth season is another great season of Lois and Clark.Below is a complete list of all 22 episodes of the final fourth Season of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman which will be released on November 14, 20061.

The chemistry with Dean Cain and Terti Hatcher was amazing similar at the time with David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson and their chemistry showed greatly with the full run of the show.  The series villains for the show were pretty light-written as meaning that unlike the Lex Luthor of Smallville they made the Lois and Clark one more whimsical with the notion of his obsession with Lois Lane.  The series effects by today standards might not be the greatest to see but still there not all that bad for their time and if you've seen other shows playing at the same time you'll see that the effects could have been a lot worse off.

1016696,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000HWZ4B6,Robert Moore,"[47, 59]","Season Four of THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK is one of the most influential seasons in the history of television.  Why?  The answer lies in the romance.  Many television series feature romantic couples between whom there is considerable attraction, even if they are not actually together as a couple.  Sam and Diane on CHEERS; Buffy and Angel on BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER; Maggie and Joel on NORTHERN EXPOSURE; John and Aeryn on FARSCAPE; Veronica and Logan on VERONICA MARS; JD and Elliott on SCRUBS; Mal and Inara on FIREFLY; Kate and Jack on LOST (sorry fans of Sawyer--his only role is to provide a triangle to complicate things between Kate and Jack); Max and Logan on DARK ANGEL; Clark and Lana on SMALLVILLE; and so on through a host of shows.  But anyone who has watched these shows knows one thing:  the two characters, much like the lovers on the side of Keats's urn, forever pursue each other, never finding true love.  Why is this?  The answer comes from two shows that made the mistake of allowing the lovers to get together:  MOONLIGHTING (David and Maddie) and THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK.The first season of the show documented the slowly developing attraction between Lois and Clark, ending with their deciding to be friends.  Season Two saw them gradually rekindling their attraction, culminating with Clark proposing to Lois in the season finale.  In Season Three she turned over the proposal for a few episodes and said yes.  But after they married, an interesting thing happened:  the ratings plummetted.  Though many fans were as interested in the show as ever, for many viewers (and most critics) the central tension of the show was resolved, and the show almost overnight lost much of its viewership.  The same thing had happened on MOONLIGHTING.  David and Maddie flirted forever, but once they slept with one another, the ratings collapsed and many viewers lost interest in the show.  The challenge for contemporary writers is not how to get two lovers together, but how to keep two lovers obviously destined for one another apart.So if you wonder about the real reason that Buffy and Angel couldn't get together, blame MOONLIGHTING and LOIS AND CLARK.  If you listen to DVD commentaries for various shows, it is clear that people who run shows are acutely aware of the David/Maddie and Lois/Clark problem:  if you allow your lovers to find true love, viewers will lose interest in the show.  So, everyone in charge of a show may allow leading characters to flirt, may allow them to express desire, may put on prominent display how they feel for one another, maybe even allow them get together briefly, but they won't let them get together for good.  If they are lucky, they may get together in the final episode, but not until then.  Some shows are lame as they turn sommersaults to keep the lovers apart.  Some--like FARSCAPE, which turned the placing of barriers into a high art form--are masterful at keeping them apart in new and inventive ways.Indeed, Season Four is by far the least interesting of the show's four seasons.  Once they got Lois and Clark married, most of the dramatic tension of the show evaporated.  Yes, it was fun to see how they worked out as a couple, but that doesn't negate the fact that more than anything in the first three seasons we wanted to know whether they could be a couple.  Once that happened, the show was directionless.  Unfortunately, the culmination of Lois and Clark's relationship was coupled with a new emphasis on an episodic as opposed to serial format.  More and more in Seasons 2 and 3 the show emphasized serial elements, allowing storylines to spill over from week to week, allowing story arcs to extend over many episodes.  But in Season Four nearly every episode is stands alone.  Most hardcore fans of shows want shows to become more, not less, serial.  Most of the joy of shows like THE X-FILES, BUFFY, ANGEL, 24, THE SOPRANOS, VERONICA MARS, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, DARK ANGEL, and LOST is following an ever expanding and developing central story.  But just as LOIS AND CLARK seemed to be moving in this direction, they retreated from it entirely.  No doubt this was at the demand of the network.  Fans, critics, writers, and actors love long, involved, and ongoing story arcs; network execs and advertisers hate them.  Why?  Because involved stories require that one be aware of what has happened before.  If you watch the 11th episode of the 5th season of LAW AND ORDER without having seen the show before, you won't be lost at all; you'll instantly be able to follow every nuance of the show.  But if you try to watch the 8th episode of Season 2 of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, you'll be utterly lost.  Too much has happened, too much prior knowledge is required to appreciate what is happening.  The problem with Season 4 of LOIS AND CLARK is that while there is no question that it became friendlier to new viewers, it became less interesting to older viewers.  The stories in Season 4 simply feel flat and less interesting in comparison to the previous two.Nonetheless, although Season 4 is clearly the low point of the series, if you like the characters, the show remains fun despite the crippling changes.  Lois and Clark still have great interpersonal chemistry, and even if there is no longer any tension around whether they will get together, it is still fun to see them work out the kinks in a marriage pairing an ordinary human and a super hero.  Though the ongoing story arcs aren't nearly as interesting as in previous seasons, there are still a number of strong episodes.  I can't imagine any fan of the earlier seasons finding nothing to enjoy in this one.  And I would certainly have liked to see what would have happened in Season 5.  Obviously Season 5 would have in large part centered around the child who mysteriously appeared in their home at the end of Season 4.  The challenge would have been whether they could have introduced any story arcs that would have regenerated some of the romantic tension that made the first three seasons so much fun.  I'm rather sceptical that they could have, and although I remained a fan of the show until the end, I will be the first to admit that the writers made a serious mistake in allowing Lois and Clark to marry and perhaps even to get engaged.  Clark's proposal at the end of Season 2 and the tension for the first few episodes of Season 3 were unquestionably high points in the run of the series, but one has to wonder whether all this was justified given the tremendous loss of romantic tension on the show.To be honest, although I give Season 3 four stars, it probably deserves less.  But I enjoyed the show so much the first three seasons that I simply can't bring myself to give it less than four.  In retrospect it is easy to criticize the writers for taking the show in the direction it did.  They should have taken a cue from Keats and kept the lovers chasing one another.  Very possible the ratings would have stayed high rather than declining.  But one thing is certain:  given the ratings collapse of LOIS AND CLARK in Season 4, few if any series in the future will allow the central romantic couple to experience extended periods of bliss and happiness.  It is the lovers' chase that delights viewers, not their finally embracing one another.",4,"Still fun, but a steep decline from the previous three seasons",1156982400,"08 31,

I could have done without the Robin Hood-themed return of Tempus ('Soul Mates'), considering it ultimately added nothing to the plotline. We're supposed to believe that they have to go back in time to prevent today's Lois from dying from a curse. I'm almost certain that I saw Dean Cain himself wincing behind the mask--and it wasn't from anything physical which he incured during the filming of this episode!Their wedding backdrop is pretty, but the role of Mike (David Doyle) is never fully explained either. Is he supposed to be some kind of guardian angel? Also ignored is how other people somehow manage to all get to that tropical surrounding sans the Superman Express--it must have been one heck of a hike from Metropolis! Personally, I would be a little concerned if I somehow ended up at a remote location without any prior memory of the travel, even if for a good friend's wedding.I think the ongoing arc of 'New Krypton' actually had some promise. Clark DIDN'T know his real biological heritage and was sincerely curious about this part of himself. And with multiculturalism quickly having become such a trend in the 1990's, acknowlleging that Clark Kent also would want to participate in it was one of the more clever storylines.But after Nor was defeated, they suddenly dropped it until the end when a 'baby' showed up on Lois and Clark's doorstep (I'm willing to bet it came from somebody on New Krypton who couldn't parent--but knew of suitable and willing adoptive parents!. Having Zara and Ching--now as a couple return--to double date and assist with the crimefighting as needed would have been a novel plot twist!But I did like 'Brutal Youth' particularly because I am yes still trying to prove myself in an equally-competitive environment. So I can now really relate to Jimmy Olsen (Justin Whalin)'s desire to be recognized for doing good work in the newsroom. I got unexpectedly emotional when he was on the verge of death in Perry White's office. Cracking the story required a great risk to his life--certainly something which earned the respect of 'more seasoned journalists'.Another great one is 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' because one of the tabloid journalists which Perry White had ranted about catches Lois and 'Superman' in--well, you know! The ensuing stories create a problem. Superman, the paragon of justice and virtue, is suspected of having an affair with a married woman! How will they ever get out of this one?Initially psyched to realize he has Superman's body after a psychic-swap, a criminal subsequently realizes he is also obligated to do the right thing ('I've Got You Under My Skin'). The episode shows that Clark finds good in everybody--including those people who society would just cast off---and their relatives. He does not pass judgement on the person's daughter for her living and/or family sittuation, she is gennuinely compassionate towards him.This is also the season where Lois's father finds out Clark's secret. He handles it suprisingly well, considering that Lois doesn't seem to have the best relationship with either of her parents. Plus, it's probally not every day people learn their children are married to internationally reknowned and virtually indestructable superheroes. Sam Lane is a pretty cool guy!There is an interactive timeline with Dean Cain included on this disc. Unfortunately, there is also a retrospective character promo including the horrid 'Superman Returns' bomb. It only made me wish that Cain himself had starred in Superman movies.",4,Fly to this season,1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,3655,"['finally', 'long', 'last', 'got', 'hold', 'season', 'complete', 'collection', 'much-loved', 'series.But', 'clunker', 'season', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Robin', 'Hood-themed', 'return', 'Tempus', 'Mates', 'considering', 'ultimately', 'added', 'nothing', 'plotline', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'prevent', 'today', 'Lois', 'dying', 'curse', ""'m"", 'almost', 'certain', 'saw', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'wincing', 'mask', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'physical', 'incured', 'filming', 'episode', 'wedding', 'backdrop', 'pretty', 'role', 'Mike', 'David', 'Doyle', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'either', 'supposed', 'be', 'kind', 'guardian', 'angel', 'Also', 'ignored', 'how', 'other', 'people', 'somehow', 'manage', 'get', 'tropical', 'surrounding', 'Superman', 'Express', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'heck', 'hike', 'Metropolis', 'Personally', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'concerned', 'somehow', 'ended', 'up', 'remote', 'location', 'prior', 'memory', 'travel', 'even', 'good', 'friend', 'wedding.I', 'think', 'ongoing', 'arc', ""'New"", 'Krypton', 'actually', 'had', 'promise', 'Clark', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'know', 'real', 'biological', 'heritage', 'was', 'sincerely', 'curious', 'part', 'multiculturalism', 'quickly', 'having', 'become', 'such', 'trend', '1990', 'acknowlleging', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'also', 'would', 'want', 'participate', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'clever', 'storylines.But', 'Nor', 'was', 'defeated', 'suddenly', 'dropped', 'end', 'when', ""'baby"", 'showed', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'doorstep', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'came', 'somebody', 'New', 'Krypton', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'parent', 'knew', 'suitable', 'willing', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'Having', 'Zara', 'Ching', 'now', 'couple', 'return', 'double', 'date', 'assist', 'crimefighting', 'needed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'novel', 'plot', 'twist', 'did', ""'Brutal"", 'Youth', 'particularly', 'am', 'yes', 'still', 'trying', 'prove', 'equally-competitive', 'environment', 'can', 'now', 'really', 'relate', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'Justin', 'Whalin', 'desire', 'be', 'recognized', 'doing', 'good', 'work', 'newsroom', 'got', 'unexpectedly', 'emotional', 'when', 'was', 'verge', 'death', 'Perry', 'White', 'office', 'Cracking', 'story', 'required', 'great', 'risk', 'life', 'certainly', 'something', 'earned', 'respect', ""'more"", 'seasoned', ""journalists'.Another"", 'great', 'one', ""'Sex"", 'Lies', 'Videotape', 'one', 'tabloid', 'journalists', 'Perry', 'White', 'had', 'ranted', 'catches', 'Lois', ""'Superman"", 'well', 'know', 'ensuing', 'stories', 'create', 'problem', 'Superman', 'paragon', 'justice', 'virtue', 'suspected', 'having', 'affair', 'married', 'woman', 'How', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'one', 'Initially', 'psyched', 'realize', 'Superman', 'body', 'psychic-swap', 'criminal', 'subsequently', 'also', 'obligated', 'do', 'right', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'My', 'Skin', 'episode', 'Clark', 'good', 'everybody', 'including', 'people', 'who', 'society', 'would', 'just', 'cast', 'off', '-and', 'relatives', 'not', 'pass', 'judgement', 'person', 'daughter', 'living', 'and/or', 'family', 'sittuation', 'gennuinely', 'compassionate', 'towards', 'him.This', 'also', 'season', 'where', 'Lois', 'father', 'out', 'Clark', 'secret', 'suprisingly', 'well', 'considering', 'Lois', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'best', 'relationship', 'parents', 'probally', 'not', 'day', 'people', 'learn', 'children', 'are', 'married', 'internationally', 'reknowned', 'virtually', 'indestructable', 'superheroes', 'Sam', 'Lane', 'pretty', 'cool', 'guy', 'interactive', 'timeline', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'included', 'disc', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'retrospective', 'character', 'promo', 'including', 'horrid', ""'Superman"", 'Returns', 'bomb', 'only', 'made', 'wish', 'Cain', 'had', 'starred', 'Superman', 'movies']",N/A
1016698,A3RTUMXGXZ50TY,B000HWZ4B6,"Sally Seashells ""Loves Movies""","[1, 1]","I love most things Superman, so it would have to be really bad to get a bad review from me. Lois & Clark combined romance with the Superman character, so they had a viewer in me! Like so many shows, the last year had a much more dramatic feel to it than the more comic way in which they started. There were still idiotic, evil characters, but Dean Cain & Teri Hatcher played it straight, which is the only way some of the episodes didn't seem totally ridiculous. It didn't have any of the comic book feel.I missed Teri Hatcher playing it for laughs. Her character got very serious in the later shows. I missed ther ability to make you laugh one minute and capture a dramatic moment the next. Part of that was by getting them married, a lot of the competition and sexual tension was completely irradicated. I think if they made them still very competitive in the marriage, there might have been more to key off to make things interesting.What I liked about Lois & Clark was that the show was about ""Clark Kent"". I loved how they explored that side of him. He was, after all, posing as a human since we was found as an infant. Christopher Reeve's portrayal made Clark act geekish. No other Superman had ever been portrayed that way, so it wasn't out of character for Dean to play him as a Clark desireous of being human, but wanting to help mankind with his abilities.While I loved the romance, I think putting them together as a married couple lost a lot of the audience (i.e. teenage boys who probably didn't get off on all the smooching that went on after the 2nd season). I think at that point, it definitely became a woman's show!Smallville was different from this show in that they did put Clark together with his girlfriend Lana. I think if they let Clark fly, the show would have already ended.  Lois & Clark eliminated all the surprise, the competition between the two characters, and any sexual tension once they were married. I was sorry it ended without resolving their childless situation. Obviously the writers were setting it up for Season 5, which never happened. I guess no one was interested in the further adventures of Lois & Clark & Baby.",4,"Good, but not the best year",1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,2157,"['love', 'most', 'things', 'Superman', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'really', 'bad', 'get', 'bad', 'review', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'combined', 'romance', 'Superman', 'character', 'had', 'viewer', 'so', 'many', 'shows', 'last', 'year', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'dramatic', 'feel', 'more', 'comic', 'way', 'started', 'were', 'still', 'idiotic', 'evil', 'characters', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'played', 'straight', 'only', 'way', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'totally', 'ridiculous', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'comic', 'book', 'feel.I', 'missed', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'playing', 'laughs', 'character', 'got', 'very', 'serious', 'later', 'missed', 'ther', 'ability', 'make', 'one', 'minute', 'capture', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'next', 'Part', 'was', 'getting', 'married', 'lot', 'competition', 'sexual', 'tension', 'was', 'completely', 'irradicated', 'think', 'made', 'still', 'very', 'competitive', 'marriage', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'key', 'off', 'make', 'things', 'liked', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'loved', 'how', 'explored', 'side', 'was', 'posing', 'human', 'was', 'found', 'infant', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'portrayal', 'made', 'Clark', 'act', 'geekish', 'other', 'Superman', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'portrayed', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'character', 'Dean', 'play', 'Clark', 'desireous', 'being', 'human', 'wanting', 'help', 'mankind', 'abilities.While', 'loved', 'romance', 'think', 'putting', 'together', 'married', 'couple', 'lost', 'lot', 'audience', 'i.e', 'teenage', 'boys', 'who', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'off', 'smooching', 'went', '2nd', 'season', 'think', 'point', 'definitely', 'became', 'woman', 'show', 'Smallville', 'was', 'different', 'show', 'did', 'put', 'Clark', 'together', 'girlfriend', 'Lana', 'think', 'let', 'Clark', 'fly', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'already', 'ended', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'eliminated', 'surprise', 'competition', 'two', 'characters', 'sexual', 'tension', 'were', 'married', 'was', 'sorry', 'ended', 'resolving', 'childless', 'situation', 'Obviously', 'writers', 'were', 'setting', 'up', 'Season', '5', 'never', 'happened', 'guess', 'one', 'was', 'interested', 'further', 'adventures', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'Baby']",N/A
1016699,A2M6SAHM4XJTAC,B000HWZ4B6,S. E. Bradfield,"[0, 0]","I loved the Pilot for Lois & Clark so much that I usually say it's my favorite Superman movie. The first season was excellent. The second was still pretty good. The third was okay. The fourth was pretty bad. Now that I've rewatched the entire series I've been better able to pinpoint what I didn't like about the later seasons. It was too light. I think I may have said that before, but for me the problem became that they took a rich storyline (the comics from the '80s and '90s were quite good with their continuity) and turned it into a simplistic romance novel. It ended up being almost a parody of itself, not to mention the source material, and the ending was pure sap. The introduction of the god-like 'Mike' (who I suppose is meant to be then-editor Mike Carlin) to wrap things up and guarantee a happy ending was a disaster, and ended an otherwise good series on a very sour note.Dean Cain's performances improved steadily over the four seasons. Teri Hatcher is always excellent, but her Lois was written as way to whiny and self-absorbed. Everybody else was a sidekick, whereas in the comics of that time they all had their own strong storylines. This is why television is a good medium for bringing comics to the screen, because big budget movies don't have time for everything and have to go for the &#34;Wow Factor&#34;.After watching it again I have to admit I liked it better the second time around, or my rating would have been a lot worse.

That image alone captivated my curiosity and excitement, so I made it my goal to read those comics that came to be the story of ""The Death of Superman."" Since then, I wanted to read and see all things Superman at that time. Then, in late 1993, a television show called ""Lois and Clark"" came to my attention and I was quite excited to watch it as a teenager. At the time, it was kinda a big deal for me. Then, life happens and I moved on after four years of watching this show.After watching ""Smallville"" in the last decade, I remembered the 90s show and now wanting to watch it again. So, I purchased this fourth season with all previous seasons purchased elsewhere - I have now just finished watching all of them and was very glad to have watched this story once more.As one would know, when watching a television show as a kid, one's perception would be very different when watching the same show as an adult. As a kid, it was a first time and very confusing as I was very much starting out as a ""fan,"" so to speak, and still learning how to live life, and I was very interested about Superman's relationship with a famed reporter, Lois Lane. In this show, their relationship would be developed and they are now married and in the end, on the way to have a family. (But, it would seemed that my favorite episodes are the ones that has H.G. Wells and all that interesting time-travel fun).And, watching the fourth season takes me back to the first season and onward to see how Clark and Lois's relationship evolved and how they managed to overcome every obstacles that came their way. It's a story of a romantic couple.I didn't care if the writing wasn't all that great, or the acting was a sort of semi-bad, or even the subplots seemed chewy chewy - I really enjoyed all of the episodes now as I did then. They were really fun to watch and a wonderful romantic comedy story in its own stead.I'm very grateful to Deborah Joy LeVine for developing this story for the television, to bring Superman back to our screen after ""Superboy"" cancelled in 1992 (which I had never watched), and to Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain for their wonderful portrayals of Lois and Clark.",5,A Wonderful Show,1365811200,"04 13, 2013",2013,2359,"['first', 'heard', 'Superman', 'when', 'stumbled', 'comic', 'book', 'stand', 'grocery', 'store', 'seeing', 'image', 'torn', 'red', 'cape', 'letter', 'S', 'woodstick', 'stood', 'wedged', 'rocks', 'image', 'alone', 'captivated', 'curiosity', 'excitement', 'made', 'goal', 'read', 'comics', 'came', 'be', 'story', 'Death', 'Superman', 'then', 'wanted', 'read', 'see', 'things', 'Superman', 'time', 'Then', 'late', '1993', 'television', 'show', 'called', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'came', 'attention', 'was', 'quite', 'excited', 'watch', 'teenager', 'time', 'was', 'kinda', 'big', 'deal', 'Then', 'life', 'happens', 'moved', 'four', 'years', 'watching', 'show.After', 'watching', 'Smallville', 'last', 'decade', 'remembered', '90s', 'show', 'now', 'wanting', 'watch', 'again', 'So', 'purchased', 'fourth', 'season', 'previous', 'seasons', 'purchased', 'elsewhere', 'have', 'now', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'was', 'very', 'glad', 'have', 'watched', 'story', 'once', 'more.As', 'one', 'would', 'know', 'when', 'watching', 'television', 'show', 'kid', 'one', 'perception', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'different', 'when', 'watching', 'same', 'show', 'adult', 'kid', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'very', 'confusing', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'starting', 'out', 'fan', 'so', 'speak', 'still', 'learning', 'how', 'live', 'life', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'Superman', 'relationship', 'famed', 'reporter', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'show', 'relationship', 'would', 'be', 'developed', 'are', 'now', 'married', 'end', 'way', 'have', 'family', 'would', 'seemed', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'are', 'ones', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'interesting', 'time-travel', 'fun', '.And', 'watching', 'fourth', 'season', 'back', 'first', 'season', 'onward', 'see', 'how', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'relationship', 'evolved', 'how', 'managed', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'came', 'way', 'story', 'romantic', 'couple.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'writing', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'acting', 'was', 'sort', 'semi-bad', 'even', 'subplots', 'seemed', 'chewy', 'chewy', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'now', 'did', 'then', 'were', 'really', 'fun', 'watch', 'wonderful', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'story', 'own', 'stead.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'grateful', 'Deborah', 'Joy', 'LeVine', 'developing', 'story', 'television', 'bring', 'Superman', 'back', 'screen', 'Superboy', 'cancelled', '1992', 'had', 'never', 'watched', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'wonderful', 'portrayals', 'Lois', 'Clark']",N/A
