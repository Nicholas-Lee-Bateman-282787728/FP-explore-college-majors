Well,Dr. Frasier Crane(Kelsey Grammer) and Lilith Sternin(Bebe Neuwirth) are getting real hot and heavy with their romance. Sometime around now,Sam Malone(Ted Danson) finally regained ownership of his bar,which he sold previously. Rebecca Howe(Kirstie Alley) was demoted to barmaid,so she's working when Carla Tortelli(Rhea Perlman) isn't. However,they'd work at the bar together at times. Cheers never made it to #1 in the Nielsen ratings this season,for that position was occupied by another NBC sitcom,The Cosby Show. Alley,at this time was a movie star,she wrapped up filming LOOK WHO'S TALKING with John Travolta before this season began. She also filmed MADHOUSE with John Larroquette,the star of another NBC hit sitcom,Night Court.

It should be released quicker on dvd. This season has some of the greatest episodes of all time on it. From ""Improbable Dreams Parts 1+2"", to ""What is....Cliff Clavin"", when Cliff was on Jeopardy, which was named, by TV Guide as one of the funniest episodes of any show, of all time a couple of years ago, its all classic. I just wish we didn't have to wait 70 more days. Cheers: The Complete Eighth Season has long been awaited by us fans, and I'm going to reserve my copy weeks in advance. My only problem with these dvds, and I'm not gonna give less stars because of it, because the episodes are classic enough, is the lack of extras. I saw on this website some hilarious Cheers bloopers, and I would love to see them on dvd. But for whatever reason Paramount doesn't like to put extras on their dvds. But I would love some. But anyway, cheers to a classic tv show, that set the bar, no pun intended, so high, that every show after paled in comparison. Cheers is the best.

Cheers is a great show and I've watched the preceding 7 seasons before this one, but I would still have to say this is the weakest one I've seen yet.  In a nutshell, the first disc starts off reasonably but gets progressively weaker and  by the second disc you are in THE DOLDRUMS.  I gave up watching for a while I was so bored with it.  Later however I did push on as I'm not one to desert friends and by disc 3 it was picking up again and quite a bit so.  Disc 4 was quite good and the season ended with a bang, so that if season 9 ever comes down a bit in price, I will be picking it up.  However, I was almost ready to say I'd seen the best of it as I plodded through disc 2 and was about ready to hang the show up until things started getting much better in disc 3.  There were just no clever lines in disc 2.  Truly, it was no laughing matter.  I still think the Diane years, love her or hate her, were the best, but the Rebecca years have also had their very good moments.  If you've loved Cheers so far then you might as well continue with this season.
