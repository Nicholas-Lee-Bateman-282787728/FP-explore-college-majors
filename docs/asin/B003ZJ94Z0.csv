1377451,A1DURK17MGKBEB,B003ZJ94Z0,Ben Wasden,"[4, 6]","Blood Junkie is a new slasher movie that I liked despite not having any actual blood until the last twenty minutes or so. Up until that point, the quirky characters kept me entertained. The film is very retro, with the fashion, music, and dialogue being very authentic of the 80's. And the killer reminded me of the killer in My Bloody Valentine, with his gas mask. It's a cool killer, but unfortunately we see almost none of him until the third act.Blood Junkie is another throwback/homage to 80's slashers that began with Hatchet a few years ago. Unfortunately, most of these movies go straight to DVD with little fanfare. Blood Junkie is a movie that most people, including horror fans, probably won't see. After all, it was released by Troma. And as you may or may not know, any movie that is released by Troma but wasn't directed by Lloyd Kaufman (Poultrygeist, Toxic Avenger), usually fades into obscurity. I'm glad I saw it, though.",4,"Good Slasher, But Could've Used More 'Blood'",1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,939,"['Blood', 'Junkie', 'new', 'slasher', 'movie', 'liked', 'not', 'having', 'actual', 'blood', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'Up', 'point', 'quirky', 'characters', 'kept', 'entertained', 'film', 'very', 'retro', 'fashion', 'music', 'dialogue', 'being', 'very', 'authentic', '80', 'killer', 'reminded', 'killer', 'My', 'Bloody', 'Valentine', 'gas', 'mask', 'cool', 'killer', 'unfortunately', 'see', 'almost', 'none', 'third', 'act.Blood', 'Junkie', 'throwback/homage', '80', 'slashers', 'began', 'Hatchet', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'movies', 'go', 'straight', 'DVD', 'little', 'fanfare', 'Blood', 'Junkie', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'including', 'horror', 'fans', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'was', 'released', 'Troma', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'movie', 'released', 'Troma', 'was', ""n't"", 'directed', 'Lloyd', 'Kaufman', 'Poultrygeist', 'Toxic', 'Avenger', 'usually', 'obscurity', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'though']",N/A

I found out about this through a youtube channel of a guy reviewing it and decided to just buy it because it was only like $6 which is a steal for this movie because it's actually really good. The acting is great and has some very funny moments. Plot is your average slasher flick with teens and alcohol. The gore effects are also decent. But the main selling point of this movie is the atmosphere and setting because it feels just like an 80s slasher film. It's such a throwback and it's done really well so pick this one up and add it to your collection.,4,Very good and surprising low budget slasher,1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,598,"['was', 'very', 'nice', 'surprise', 'movie', 'found', 'out', 'youtube', 'channel', 'guy', 'reviewing', 'decided', 'just', 'buy', 'was', 'only', 'like', '6', 'steal', 'movie', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'great', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'Plot', 'average', 'slasher', 'flick', 'teens', 'alcohol', 'gore', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'decent', 'main', 'selling', 'point', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'setting', 'just', '80s', 'slasher', 'film', 'such', 'throwback', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'so', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'add', 'collection']",N/A
1377453,A3V7K5L1134ZO3,B003ZJ94Z0,Dr. Sparkles,"[4, 4]","This 2010 Troma release is one of the best modern horror releases that I've seen in a very long time.  Set in the 80's, two obnoxious d-bag friends seeking a couple of chics to take camping hang out in front of the mini-mart and succeed in their quest.  One of the girls has a prior commitment babysitting her creepo little brother, but she decides to bring him along on the trip rather than wasting all the rad booze she just purchased with $35.00.  The two gals and two guys head off to this campsite in a station wagon near an ex-chemical plant that suffered a terrible fate.  They smoke some bud, drink a bunch of booze and try to get past third base.  One of the guys, Teddy, relays a ""ghost story"" about the old chemical plant.  Unbeknownst to them, a deformed killer lurks in the woods - not sure how they didn't hear him with his gutteral grunts and overzealous ""is he having sex?"" type pervo noises.  There are so many positives to this movie I'm about ready to explode.  Let's see, Craig and Teddy are two of the most enjoyable characters to watch.  They epitomize the 80's d-bag.  The clothes, the housing decor, the mini-mart, the music and just about everything else is down to the minute details encompassing what we love about the 80's.  There are so many laughs that run on the dialogue between Craig and Teddy - inlcuding a montage of them rockin' out when they think they might actually ""get some"" and high-five slaps over just about everything.  The girls are no slouches either.  Check out Rachel doing aerobics in front of the television - totally hilarious.  Much of this movie has nothing to do with the killer, but it's just so gosh darn fun and funny and entertaining that you are getting a double treat.  The killing scenes do have the real 80's gore vibe with the bright bright red blood and don't occur really until the end.  This one has a slight twist that reminds me of ""High Tension"", maybe you'll understand what I mean.  The visual of the killer is pretty much like the guy from My Bloody Valentine, but it does much weirder things with its mask.  The story is just long enough to have you loving it and shows you what you need to know.  I love this so much, and it put me in a really good mood after watching it.  Of course you get some of the Troma banter at the beginning which is funny and the Troma extras you've come to expect.",5,BLOODY BRILLIANT,1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,2367,"['2010', 'Troma', 'release', 'one', 'best', 'modern', 'horror', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Set', '80', 'two', 'obnoxious', 'd-bag', 'friends', 'seeking', 'couple', 'chics', 'take', 'camping', 'hang', 'front', 'mini-mart', 'succeed', 'quest', 'One', 'girls', 'prior', 'commitment', 'babysitting', 'creepo', 'little', 'brother', 'bring', 'along', 'trip', 'rather', 'wasting', 'rad', 'booze', 'just', 'purchased', '35.00', 'two', 'gals', 'two', 'guys', 'head', 'campsite', 'station', 'wagon', 'ex-chemical', 'plant', 'suffered', 'terrible', 'fate', 'smoke', 'bud', 'drink', 'bunch', 'booze', 'try', 'get', 'past', 'third', 'base', 'One', 'guys', 'Teddy', 'ghost', 'story', 'old', 'chemical', 'plant', 'Unbeknownst', 'deformed', 'killer', 'lurks', 'woods', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'gutteral', 'grunts', 'overzealous', 'having', 'sex', 'type', 'pervo', 'noises', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'positives', 'movie', ""'m"", 'ready', 'explode', 'Let', 'see', 'Craig', 'Teddy', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'watch', 'epitomize', '80', 'd-bag', 'clothes', 'housing', 'decor', 'mini-mart', 'music', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'down', 'minute', 'details', 'encompassing', 'what', 'love', '80', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'laughs', 'run', 'dialogue', 'Craig', 'Teddy', 'inlcuding', 'montage', 'rockin', 'out', 'when', 'think', 'might', 'actually', 'get', 'high-five', 'slaps', 'just', 'everything', 'girls', 'are', 'slouches', 'either', 'Check', 'out', 'Rachel', 'doing', 'aerobics', 'front', 'television', 'totally', 'hilarious', 'Much', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'killer', 'just', 'so', 'gosh', 'darn', 'fun', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'are', 'getting', 'double', 'treat', 'killing', 'scenes', 'do', 'have', 'real', '80', 'gore', 'vibe', 'bright', 'bright', 'red', 'blood', 'do', ""n't"", 'occur', 'really', 'end', 'one', 'slight', 'twist', 'High', 'Tension', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'what', 'mean', 'visual', 'killer', 'pretty', 'much', 'guy', 'My', 'Bloody', 'Valentine', 'much', 'weirder', 'things', 'mask', 'story', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'have', 'loving', 'what', 'need', 'know', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'put', 'really', 'good', 'mood', 'watching', 'course', 'get', 'Troma', 'banter', 'beginning', 'funny', 'Troma', 'extras', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect']",N/A

It doesn't get much better than that. The great part about this film is the look and the wardrobe. I was AMAZED at the quality of production design that went into this film. For such a low budget movie there were no tell signs of a modern film. The biggest shock was that this film was actually shot on FILM! It had an incredible retro look. I could not get over how well done the cinematography and design was. It was also shot in a killer location. They scored a huge abandoned chemical factory. Great backdrop.Another aspect that made this film strong was the two lead male characters. Most of their lines were instant quotes that my friend and I were repeating all night after watching the film, hence the beginning quote, ""Junkies."" They were priceless.My only critique was the kill scenes were a little weak. It was completely forgivable because the rest of the movie was so entertaining.Definitely pick up this film if you are an 80's horror fan.
