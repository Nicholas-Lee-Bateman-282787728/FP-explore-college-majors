1164693,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0019SPX0E,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[42, 44]","In this inventive exercise DVD you get cardiovascular fitness, strengthening and energizing, and you'll burn lots of calories once you get the technique of Hooping down; this DVD is for beginners through advanced, with ""all ages, body types and ability levels"" benefiting from doing these movements. The hoops used are professional weighted hoops, wrapped in friction tape (helps to stick to your hips!).Christabel Zamor is attractive and dynamic, and she gives us an intro, a warm-up, ""How to Hoop,"" ""Marching in Place,"" ""Step-Touch,"" ""Grapevine,"" ""Dance Party"" 1, 2, and 3, and ""Combinations"" which are essentially the ""Dance Party"" moves extended. You'll also get a ""Cool Down"" and a fabulous performance where Christabel shows us the 101 things one can do dancing with a hoop.If you haven't done this before you'll start to feel the burn on ""the inch you can pinch"" around your waist in the ""How to Hoop"" section, and as the DVD progresses, you can almost feel your midriff toning as you dance. This is a superb exercise for your torso and especially your waist and hips, but you'll also get results for your shoulders, legs and arms.Don't worry if you feel a little clumsy at first while you try to rotate the hoop and move your feet at the same time; with very little practice, you'll get the hang of it. The ""Dance Party"" moves are terrific, and once learned, you can do them to your favorite up-tempo music, and you can do it anywhere, as not that much room is required for this. A very few square feet in your living room will suffice, and you'll have a blast while you burn up all those calories.",5,Firm Up Your Midriff and More!,1223164800,"10 5, 2008",2008,1606,"['inventive', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'get', 'cardiovascular', 'fitness', 'strengthening', 'energizing', ""'ll"", 'burn', 'lots', 'calories', 'once', 'get', 'technique', 'Hooping', 'down', 'DVD', 'beginners', 'advanced', 'ages', 'body', 'types', 'ability', 'levels', 'benefiting', 'doing', 'movements', 'hoops', 'used', 'are', 'professional', 'weighted', 'hoops', 'wrapped', 'friction', 'tape', 'stick', 'hips', '.Christabel', 'Zamor', 'attractive', 'dynamic', 'intro', 'warm-up', 'How', 'Hoop', 'Marching', 'Place', 'Step-Touch', 'Grapevine', 'Dance', 'Party', '1', '2', '3', 'Combinations', 'are', 'essentially', 'Dance', 'Party', 'extended', ""'ll"", 'also', 'get', 'Cool', 'Down', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'where', 'Christabel', '101', 'things', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'dancing', 'hoop.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', ""'ll"", 'start', 'feel', 'burn', 'inch', 'can', 'pinch', 'waist', 'How', 'Hoop', 'section', 'DVD', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'midriff', 'toning', 'dance', 'superb', 'exercise', 'torso', 'especially', 'waist', 'hips', ""'ll"", 'also', 'get', 'results', 'shoulders', 'legs', 'arms.Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'feel', 'little', 'clumsy', 'first', 'try', 'rotate', 'hoop', 'move', 'feet', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'little', 'practice', ""'ll"", 'get', 'hang', 'Dance', 'Party', 'moves', 'are', 'terrific', 'once', 'learned', 'can', 'do', 'favorite', 'up-tempo', 'music', 'can', 'do', 'anywhere', 'not', 'much', 'room', 'required', 'very', 'few', 'square', 'feet', 'living', 'room', 'will', 'suffice', ""'ll"", 'have', 'blast', 'burn', 'up', 'calories']","The Hoopdance Workout with the HoopGirl, Christabel Zamor: Hoop dance how-to, Hoop dancing fitness class"

Don't be fooled, this is a total body workout, cardio included. This program is user friendly from all ages, and sizes and there is no wrong way to hoop. It would probably be great for mother and daughter teams, or anyone else needing to get up and exercise.The instructor presents her program with familiarity and great energy. Her costumes and work out clothing are very striking, colorful. The backdrop is simple and unobtrusive, the lighting gentle enough to enhance the subject.Included in the program:Warm up- marching in place, lifting the hoop overhead, step touch, shoulder shimmies,Learn a grapevine stepBasics-foot work -marching in place adding a turn add head movement, arm placementRecovery technique-accelerating, spiraling, bend and blast.Drills- segments of three speed variations,while using motions: pulsating the torso, swimming, offering and flowing.Changing directions which are referred to as ""inflow and outflow""Footwork and arm combinationsCool down with neck and shoulder rolls, breathing, and torso drops and stretches, nice hip isolations and rotations.A  playful performance by Christabel to inspire you to create your own hoop dance.It is recommended that you purchase a professional hoop at [...]The program begins with a simple warm up, then the steps are added gradually, along with technique and hoop recovery methods. You may choose your speed in the Dance Party segments. These are accelerated to speed levels for gradual build up. A short cool down follows, then a performance that is fantastic and motivating!Long ago, hooping was a familiar trend for many of us and we could go on for hours. I am happy to see that it has returned. For this program, I recommend a professional hoop, since ordinary hoops are lightweight, and require much hip action for momentum.Overall, I felt this was a workout program with great benefits however:unclear is the comparison to yoga,the ""keep smiling,""  by the instructor  I felt was more of a filler, distracting, and out of place,the hip rotations are finally explained at the end in the cool down section. Nonetheless, that is little to complain about in comparison to all that is offered.",5,A blast from the past!,1222560000,"09 28, 2008",2008,2630,"['Hoop', 'dance', 'workoutPresented', 'Christabel', 'Zamor.World', 'Dance', 'New', 'York', 'back', 'great', 'body', 'politics', 'aimed', 'improving', 'female', 'mind', 'body.This', 'workout', 'program', 'benefits', 'working', 'body', 'circular', 'motion', 'internal', 'organs', 'spine', 'circular', 'fashion', 'improve', 'flexibility.This', 'program', 'approximately', '58', 'minutes', 'personal', 'enjoyment', 'physical', 'improvement', 'calories', 'promote', 'weight', 'loss.Hooping', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'total', 'body', 'workout', 'cardio', 'included', 'program', 'user', 'friendly', 'ages', 'sizes', 'wrong', 'way', 'hoop', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'great', 'mother', 'daughter', 'teams', 'anyone', 'else', 'needing', 'get', 'up', 'exercise.The', 'instructor', 'program', 'familiarity', 'great', 'energy', 'costumes', 'work', 'out', 'clothing', 'are', 'very', 'striking', 'colorful', 'backdrop', 'simple', 'unobtrusive', 'lighting', 'gentle', 'enough', 'enhance', 'subject.Included', 'program', 'Warm', 'up-', 'marching', 'place', 'lifting', 'hoop', 'overhead', 'step', 'touch', 'shoulder', 'shimmies', 'Learn', 'grapevine', 'stepBasics-foot', 'work', '-marching', 'place', 'adding', 'turn', 'add', 'head', 'movement', 'arm', 'placementRecovery', 'technique-accelerating', 'spiraling', 'bend', 'blast.Drills-', 'segments', 'three', 'speed', 'variations', 'using', 'motions', 'pulsating', 'torso', 'swimming', 'offering', 'flowing.Changing', 'directions', 'are', 'referred', 'inflow', 'outflow', 'Footwork', 'arm', 'combinationsCool', 'neck', 'shoulder', 'rolls', 'breathing', 'torso', 'drops', 'stretches', 'nice', 'hip', 'isolations', 'rotations.A', 'playful', 'performance', 'Christabel', 'inspire', 'create', 'own', 'hoop', 'dance.It', 'recommended', 'purchase', 'professional', 'hoop', '[', 'program', 'simple', 'warm', 'up', 'then', 'steps', 'are', 'added', 'gradually', 'technique', 'hoop', 'recovery', 'methods', 'may', 'choose', 'speed', 'Dance', 'Party', 'segments', 'are', 'accelerated', 'speed', 'levels', 'gradual', 'build', 'up', 'short', 'cool', 'down', 'then', 'performance', 'fantastic', 'motivating', 'Long', 'ago', 'hooping', 'was', 'familiar', 'trend', 'many', 'could', 'go', 'hours', 'am', 'happy', 'see', 'returned', 'program', 'recommend', 'professional', 'hoop', 'ordinary', 'hoops', 'are', 'lightweight', 'require', 'much', 'hip', 'action', 'momentum.Overall', 'felt', 'was', 'workout', 'program', 'great', 'benefits', 'however', 'unclear', 'comparison', 'yoga', 'keep', 'smiling', 'instructor', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'filler', 'distracting', 'place', 'hip', 'rotations', 'are', 'finally', 'explained', 'end', 'cool', 'down', 'section', 'Nonetheless', 'little', 'complain', 'comparison', 'offered']","The Hoopdance Workout with the HoopGirl, Christabel Zamor: Hoop dance how-to, Hoop dancing fitness class"
