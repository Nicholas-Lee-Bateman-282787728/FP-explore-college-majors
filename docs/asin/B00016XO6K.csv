794551,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00016XO6K,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[7, 8]","Have you ever heard of Caglar Juan Singletary (the man behind the song `Non-Violent Taekwondo Troopers')?  No?  How about Nilson V. Ortiz (The Thing), or Gary Forney (Chicken Insurrection)?  Probably not...should you know these individuals?  Not unless you're kin...so why am I bringing them up?  Well, I think many of us have seen the tiny, little ads in magazines (usually in the back), tabloids, or comic books that entice readers to send in poems and have them translated into songs, with the inference of possibly entering the music business and/or reaping the accompanying rewards (be they in the form of recognition or financial, or both) only to dismiss them as scams and wonder just what kind of people fall for such foolishness?  Well, the three I mentioned earlier are individuals who responded to such ads at one point or another, and have all had their words transmogrified into songs, for better or for worse...In the documentary Off the Charts: The Song-Poem Story (2003), Jamie Meltzer allows us a glimpse behind those ads I mentioned previously, detailing not only those with aspirations of having their words transformed into songs, but also those craftsmen who take on the responsibility turning someone's dreams into a vinyl reality, for a price, of course...as the film begins, Meltzer examines this rather extensive subculture, focusing on a relatively small, eclectic group within the whole, specifically the more inspired (or demented, depending on your view) elements.  How it actually works is you would send in your poem to the advertisement listed, and they would respond telling you they will take your poem and turn it into a professionally produced song, complete with singer and musical accompaniment.  All you have to do is send in some cash...and it's usually not a meager sum, but then what price can you put on stardom?  Once the cash was received, the work would begin, and a record produced, with a copy of going back to you.While watching this documentary, I think what surprised me most was seeing the level of professionalism and seriousness displayed by the individuals or companies who turn these submissions into music.  They weren't especially high tech, and usually worked alone out of their homes, but they didn't appear to be in the business of scamming or fleecing these people of their money (although I'm sure some are).  They truly seemed interested in providing what they advertised, despite the quality of the material they often received, and believe me, there is a level of awfulness that goes beyond comprehension (this seems sort of an absurd aspect, to have accomplished musicians work with generally such amateurish material).  There was a very creepy element about some of these individuals who submitted their works, but you won't be able to deny the sincerity in their desires.  They didn't appear to have delusions about stardom, but only wished to hear their words in a format that could be enjoyed by others...and as creepy as some of these people may seem, they really can't compare to those who actually collect this material, those who scrounge, scavenge, and pontificate the virtues of said music...these guys probably scared me the most (probably because I could identify with them more than anyone else in the film).  I think the part I liked the most was when we saw, in a split screen, the artist performing a song, and the person who wrote the poem hearing the song for the first time.  It's funny how these original writers react to hearing the songs created from their words, especially when they get something not quite what they expected.  The film closes with one individual, now that he has his words translated into to music, deciding it's time to take his music to the people, and he and his son go on tour (all of one stop...you gotta start somewhere).The actual documentary lasts about an hour, and the rest is made up of a plethora of special features including a director and producer commentary track, Sunburst Studio sessions (featuring the recording of six songs), deleted scenes (7 in all), a feature called the Iowa Mountain Tour, Live!, `Off the Charts' premiere party, Columbine Records Presents `America Sing!'(a variety TV show featuring a number of songs), and a song-poem advertisement gallery with commentary.  If you enjoy this, I would also recommend the book/CD combo Songs in the Key of Z: The Curious Universe of Outsider Music (I think someone already mentioned it), and another film titled Driver 23/Atlas Moth (2002), which doesn't so much pertain to `outsider' music, but is a great film about one mans dedication to his craft and the lengths to which he goes through in following his dreams.Cookieman108",5,"""Thank Jehovah for Kung Fu Bicycles and Priscilla Presley""",1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,4712,"['Have', 'ever', 'heard', 'Caglar', 'Juan', 'Singletary', 'man', 'song',

794552,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B00016XO6K,Dr. E,"[3, 3]","I watchedOff the Charts: The Song-Poem Storywith a large group of people. Around the film's mid-point, I felt emotionally conflicted. I searched the room for my cue. One man was folded-in on himself, looking wretchedly depressed. One was nonchalantly eating pistachios. Still, my own friend was laughing hysterically. What to think?Personally, I find this documentary bizarrely poignant. Voiceless members of society find a means of expressing themselves (but they have to pay someone to speak for them ... ergggg). See the problem? For instance: while everyone will find Caglar Juan Singletary fascinating, some will view him him pity ... others might find him an uninhibited genius (as Priscilla Presley may). His fascination will ""historical honeys"" and firearms clearly concerns his grandmother (oooOooOoo, just wait for it). And, yet, I desperately want to find this man and make him my best friend ... veryWesley Willis(R.I.P., my man).The construction of this documentary is rather brilliant. It moves from a playful surface read (looking at the stacks of submissions received from mental-hospital patients) to a more personal, deeper exploration. In one instance, the son of a song-poem recorder reveals the only way he knows his (now deceased) father is through his recordings. It is strangely touching.While this film certainly amuses its audience (between the impassioned performance of ""Ginseng Digger,"" Ramsey Kearney's Black-Forest name-plate, and the menagerie of exotic animals, this film never fails to elicit a laugh!!!!), it also has a tender side. Even as Gary Forney (Iowa Mountain Tour) mutters something about a ""Chicken Insurrection,"" my hearts breaks for him. His quiet vulnerability leaves the viewer stunned. There is an endearing quality ... something about chasing dreams even if your dreams include rebel chickens (no matter).You need not have any interest in the recording industry to enjoy this work ... this piece is much more about fringe-society and how ""vanity records"" may actually have a place in our world. And, I must admit ... I have LITERALLY found myself singing ""Jimmy Carter Says Yes!"" Once you hear it, you can't ""unhear"" it, my friend.Brilliant stuff.

Woodard ""The Concrete Donkey""","[1, 1]","The previous reviewers are right on many counts: this film is similar in tone to ""American Movie,"" in that we are moved to laugh at, not with, the subjects; the ""poets"" are uniformly eccentric; it is often very difficult to watch; it is often hilarious. However, I think some reviewers missed the genuine pathos this film provides. First of all, many of these people are very, very happy with the song they paid for. Second, though the musicians did often knock out songs in less than an hour, they took their work seriously, often comically so. So, in the end, we have poets paying money time after time to have their poems turned into songs they are happy with. Then, we have musicians getting paid to write music that they take fairly seriously. What's the harm in that? The true pathos in the film, though, comes when we find out one of the song-poem collecters, whom we assumed the whole time viewed the song-poem phenomenon ironically, had a genuine, sweet and ultimately sad connection with the business. In the end, this film is funny and sad, difficult to watch, due to the poets' lack of awareness of their complete self-delusion. But I think everyone in the film would feel, after watching it, that they were treated fairly; thus, I believe, unlike previous reviewers, that this film was not an exercise in exploitation. In fact, I felt sorrier for the musicians, who realize how they are prostituting their talents, than I did for the poets, who were still keeping the dream alive.",5,"Funny and sad, though not always on purpose",1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,1493,"['previous', 'reviewers', 'are', 'right', 'many', 'counts', 'film', 'similar', 'tone', 'American', 'Movie', 'are', 'moved', 'laugh', 'not', 'subjects', 'poets', 'are', 'uniformly', 'eccentric', 'often', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'often', 'hilarious', 'However', 'think', 'reviewers', 'missed', 'genuine', 'pathos', 'film', 'First', 'all', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'happy', 'song', 'paid', 'Second', 'musicians', 'did', 'often', 'knock', 'out', 'songs', 'less', 'hour', 'took', 'work', 'seriously', 'often', 'comically', 'so', 'So', 'end', 'have', 'poets', 'paying', 'money', 'time', 'time', 'have', 'poems', 'turned', 'songs', 'are', 'happy', 'Then', 'have', 'musicians', 'getting', 'paid', 'write', 'music', 'take', 'fairly', 'seriously', 'What', 'harm', 'true', 'pathos', 'film', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'one', 'song-poem', 'collecters', 'whom', 'assumed', 'whole', 'time', 'viewed', 'song-poem', 'phenomenon', 'ironically', 'had', 'genuine', 'sweet', 'ultimately', 'sad', 'connection', 'business', 'end', 'film', 'funny', 'sad', 'difficult', 'watch', 'due', 'poets', 'lack', 'awareness', 'complete', 'self-delusion', 'think', 'everyone', 'film', 'would', 'feel', 'watching', 'were', 'treated', 'fairly', 'thus', 'believe', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'exercise', 'exploitation', 'fact', 'felt', 'sorrier', 'musicians', 'who', 'realize', 'how', 'are', 'prostituting', 'talents', 'did', 'poets', 'who', 'were', 'still', 'keeping', 'dream', 'alive']",Off the Charts: The Song-Poem Story

But there is more to the song-poem story. Oh, there is a great deal more. And you can learn more about it than you ever wanted to in the essential documentary Off the Charts: The Song-Poem Story.The documentary alternately traces the history of song-poems (you know those ads in the backs of magazines telling you to send in your poem/lyrics and $250, and you'll get a professionally recorded song in return? Yeah, those), contains interviews with some of the genre's movers and shakers, both on the lyrical side and in the song mills that crank out song-poems, and show in-the-studio footage that is alternately hysterical and pathetic. Director Meltzer (Welcome to Nollywood) makes no pretensions towards objectivity here; he sees the basic absurdity of the whole industry, and his objective seems to be to show it, from the scary, dysfunctional people who send these poems to be recorded to the recording artists who see themselves as superior to the lyricists (but are just as nuts).I call this ""essential"" because I think it will appeal not only to those who enjoy outsider music, but to just about anyone. People who enjoy the dysfunctional idiots who people reality TV will find a great deal to enjoy here. Those who enjoy the countrywide mediocrity of American Idol will love it. Those who just like a well-turned documentary will get a kick out of it. John Trubee fans will love his jaded take on things. Those who always root for the underdog will find new artists to champion. Really, there's something for everyone here. Find a copy of this and watch it; there's so much to be enjoyed here that it will be well worth your time and effort.

794556,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00016XO6K,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 3]","This is one of my favorite documentaries of all time. I have been a fan of song-poems for years, and this movie is the best explanation and analysis of the phenomena that I have ever seen. This film chronicles the important characters in American song-poem history, such as Rodd Keith and Ramsey Kearney (singer of perhaps the most famous of all song-poems, which he graciously apologizes for...), and such technical details as the functioning of the Mellotron and overdubbing techniques.I have read the book ""Songs in the Key of Z"" (and highly recommend it), but this film best captures not only the humorous qualities of this musical genre, but also the human side of these aspiring songwriters. It's easy to laugh at a song like ""Non-Violent Taekwondo Troopers,"" ""I am a Ginseng Digger,"" or ""Chicken Insurrection,"" but when you see the people who labored over these misdirected masterpieces, it definitely makes you empathetic to their plight. Particularly brilliant in this film are the interview segments, which highlight these songwriters and the people who actually make the music. Be sure to watch the film with commentary off and then once again with it on to get some additional insight from the filmmakers, and whatever you do, make sure you watch the extras to see the entire live set by the Iowa Mountain Tour (as painful as this may to be), and the discussion of the song-poem classic ""The Moon Men,"" a song with perhaps the most complex yet unfathomable rhyme scheme and meter of any song ever recorded.This is a wonderful film, and I absolutely recommend it to any audience: it is captivating, humanizing, and uplifting to see the human spirit of these people struggle against obscurity.",5,Non-Violent Taekwondo Troopers And More!,1101686400,"11 29, 2004",2004,1703,"['one', 'favorite', 'documentaries', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'song-poems', 'years', 'movie', 'best', 'explanation', 'analysis', 'phenomena', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'important', 'characters', 'American', 'song-poem', 'history', 'such', 'Rodd', 'Keith', 'Ramsey', 'Kearney', 'singer', 'perhaps', 'most', 'famous', 'song-poems', 'graciously', 'such', 'technical', 'details', 'functioning', 'Mellotron', 'overdubbing', 'techniques.I', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'Songs', 'Key', 'Z', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'best', 'not', 'only', 'humorous', 'qualities', 'musical', 'genre', 'also', 'human', 'side', 'aspiring', 'songwriters', 'easy', 'laugh', 'song', 'Non-Violent', 'Taekwondo', 'Troopers', 'am', 'Ginseng', 'Digger', 'Chicken', 'Insurrection', 'when', 'see', 'people', 'who', 'labored', 'misdirected', 'masterpieces', 'definitely', 'empathetic', 'plight', 'Particularly', 'brilliant', 'film', 'are', 'interview', 'segments', 'highlight', 'songwriters', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'make', 'music', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'film', 'commentary', 'off', 'then', 'once', 'again', 'get', 'additional', 'insight', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'extras', 'see', 'entire', 'live', 'set', 'Iowa', 'Mountain', 'Tour', 'as', 'painful', 'may', 'be', 'discussion', 'song-poem', 'classic', 'Moon', 'Men', 'song', 'perhaps', 'most', 'complex', 'yet', 'unfathomable', 'rhyme', 'scheme', 'meter', 'song', 'ever', 'recorded.This', 'wonderful', 'film', 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'audience', 'captivating', 'humanizing', 'uplifting', 'see', 'human', 'spirit', 'people', 'struggle', 'obscurity']",Off the Charts: The Song-Poem Story
794557,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B00016XO6K,stoic,"[0, 0]","Off the Charts is an interesting documentary about people who dream of composing hit songs. For many years, companies have placed classified ads offering to create songs if people send in lyrics - and cash. Off the Charts focuses both on the would-be songwriters who send in lyrics and on the musicians who compose songs to go with the lyrics.Though thousands of songs have been created this way through the years, none has ever become a hit. But the world is not short on people who will pay to chase their dreams. Off the Charts, then, is a film about dreamers who refuse to give up. The would-be songwriters in this film are a varied bunch. Two of the most memorable are:- Gary Forney is an Iowa man whose songwriting dreamsinspire  him to call a disk jockey in Denmark from a payphone  and to undertake a ""tour"" that consists of one (shaky) concert. Gary's songs include ""Chicken Insurrection"" and ""Three-Eyed Boy.""- New York's Caglar Singletary is a unique man whose songs combine his love for kung fu, Annie Oakley, guns, and Christianity - among many other things. Caglar's songs include ""Non-Violent Taekwondo Troopers.""The other side of the story is provided by the musicians and businesspeople who make money by turn the dreamers' lyrics into songs. The most-vivid character among the musicians is Gene Merlino (aka Gene Marshall). Merlino started out in the music industry in the 1950s and won a 1966 Grammy (beating out the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, among others). However, his career quickly fizzled and he ended up as ""The King of the Demo Singers."" The viewer feels Merlino's frustration and cynicism while watching Merlino berate his fellow musicians during a ""song-poem"" session.In contrasting the dreaming songwriters and the cynical musicians, the filmmakers cause the viewer to reflect on the tensions between art and commerce. For those most part, however, the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions.
