It had some new information to me.Be be warned- this is not just a video about where Jesus walked.I really wanted to watch a video about the places Jesus went.... The Sea of Galilee etc. This video had some of that but it did not have a lot of that by the end. It started off with information about the places Jesus walked, but before too long it turned into a video about the story of Jesus.The other thing to be aware of is that this is a dated video. It is slightly older and as such does not use newer discoveries. Some of the video in this video also seems older than other parts. The colors look faded and seem dated in places.Overall the video isn't long and if you have Amazon Prime it is worth the time to watch it. I probably wouldn't spend much money to watch it though.Enjoy.",4,Interesting with some notes,1373328000,"07 9, 2013",2013,820,"['video', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'had', 'new', 'information', 'me.Be', 'be', 'warned-', 'not', 'just', 'video', 'where', 'Jesus', 'really', 'wanted', 'watch', 'video', 'places', 'Jesus', 'went', 'Sea', 'Galilee', 'etc', 'video', 'had', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'end', 'started', 'off', 'information', 'places', 'Jesus', 'walked', 'too', 'long', 'turned', 'video', 'story', 'Jesus.The', 'other', 'thing', 'be', 'aware', 'dated', 'video', 'slightly', 'older', 'such', 'not', 'use', 'newer', 'discoveries', 'video', 'video', 'also', 'older', 'other', 'parts', 'colors', 'look', 'faded', 'seem', 'dated', 'places.Overall', 'video', ""n't"", 'long', 'have', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'time', 'watch', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'spend', 'much', 'money', 'watch', 'though.Enjoy']",N/A

775177,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B0000CBXYH,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[4, 6]","Beautiful videography in a documentary format that follows the life of Jesus on a visual tour of the Holy Land. The film starts out promisingly, showing Christian pilgrimage sites and other things you cannot see unless you visit Israel. But the narrated recreations of Jesus's life, while charmingly quaint at first, grow increasingly distracting as they gradually come to dominant the film. By the end of this overlong (70 minutes) visual meditation on the life of Christ, we are watching a poorly dubbed and hammily recreated passion play. The interesting pilgrimage sites and descriptive narration of the holy land disappears by the end. Although the concept is good and the scenery is beautiful, the film increasingly put me to sleep as it descended into hokey narration. Worth a look for younger kids, but anyone older will probably find it a bit painful to watch. The visuals and music are still very well done.",4,Dull but beautiful visual tour of the Holy Land,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,917,"['Beautiful', 'videography', 'documentary', 'format', 'life', 'Jesus', 'visual', 'tour', 'Holy', 'Land', 'film', 'out', 'promisingly', 'showing', 'Christian', 'pilgrimage', 'sites', 'other', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'visit', 'Israel', 'narrated', 'recreations', 'Jesus', 'life', 'charmingly', 'quaint', 'first', 'grow', 'increasingly', 'distracting', 'gradually', 'come', 'dominant', 'film', 'end', 'overlong', '70', 'minutes', 'visual', 'meditation', 'life', 'Christ', 'are', 'watching', 'poorly', 'dubbed', 'hammily', 'recreated', 'passion', 'play', 'interesting', 'pilgrimage', 'sites', 'descriptive', 'narration', 'holy', 'land', 'disappears', 'end', 'concept', 'good', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'film', 'increasingly', 'put', 'sleep', 'descended', 'hokey', 'narration', 'look', 'younger', 'kids', 'anyone', 'older', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'bit', 'painful', 'watch', 'visuals', 'music', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'well', 'done']",N/A
