858127,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B00063MCI4,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[78, 78]","It's easy for Arthur Conan Doyle purists to find fault with the Australian-produced ""Lost World"" television series, but for sheer escapism, this enjoyable series had a lot to offer fans; better-than-average CGI dinosaur effects, a wonderful, attractive cast who could actually act, storylines that were always entertaining, if frequently derivative, and, best of all, the glorious, lush Australian landscape, substituting for an uncharted plateau in South America.The series was an extremely expensive one to produce, requiring a large group of investors (including New Line) to finance it, and by the third season, further difficulties arose, most notably the Australian work laws, which forced American actress Jennifer O'Dell (the gloriously sexy Veronica), and Canadian actor David Orth (American journalist Ned Malone) to severely limit their appearances. While losing two leads could have been disasterous, the series actually became more interesting, with the long-smouldering romance between daredevil Lord John Roxton (Will Snow) and gorgeous 'Woman with a Past' Marguerite Krux (Rachel Blakely) finally igniting, and the introduction of a young refugee from the future, Finn (Lara Cox), providing a sarcastic foil to team leader George Challenger (Peter McCauley). With the easy comraderie developed over the show's run, and the improved writing a frequently smaller cast provided, Season Three of ""The Lost World"" was a continuing pleasure.Sadly, after producing the ""Cliffhanger to end ALL Cliffhangers"" as the season finale, funding ran out, and ""The Lost World"" was not picked up for a fourth season. While the series has a large, very loyal fan base, and the entire cast have expressed a willingness to return to their roles, frequent attempts to revive it, at least as a 'Made-for-TV' movie, have failed, and it appears unlikely that the fate of Professor Challenger's band of adventurers will ever be resolved.If you are a fan (like me), Season 3 will complete a cherished collection; if you have never seen ""The Lost World"", buying this collection will provide you with some of the most exciting, romantic episodes of a truly remarkable fantasy series, and will certainly whet your appetite for the first two seasons, which are available on DVD, as well!What an adventure you have in store for you!",4,Last Season of Underrated Fantasy Series,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,2316,"['easy', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'find', 'fault', 'Australian-produced', 'Lost', 'World', 'television', 'series', 'sheer', 'escapism', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'had', 'lot', 'offer', 'fans', 'better-than-average', 'CGI', 'dinosaur', 'effects', 'wonderful', 'attractive', 'cast', 'who', 'could', 'actually', 'act', 'storylines', 'were', 'always', 'entertaining', 'frequently', 'derivative', 'best', 'glorious', 'lush', 'Australian', 'landscape', 'substituting', 'uncharted', 'plateau', 'South', 'America.The', 'series', 'was', 'extremely', 'expensive', 'one', 'produce', 'requiring', 'large', 'group', 'investors', 'including', 'New', 'Line', 'finance', 'third', 'season', 'further', 'difficulties', 'arose', 'most', 'notably', 'Australian', 'work', 'laws', 'forced', 'American', 'actress', 'Jennifer', ""O'Dell"", 'gloriously', 'sexy', 'Veronica', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'David', 'Orth', 'American', 'journalist', 'Ned', 'Malone', 'severely', 'limit', 'appearances', 'losing', 'two', 'leads', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'disasterous', 'series', 'actually', 'became', 'more', 'interesting', 'long-smouldering', 'romance', 'daredevil', 'Lord', 'John', 'Roxton', 'Will', 'Snow', 'gorgeous', ""'Woman"", 'Past', 'Marguerite', 'Krux', 'Rachel', 'Blakely', 'finally', 'igniting', 'introduction', 'young', 'refugee', 'future', 'Finn', 'Lara', 'Cox', 'providing', 'sarcastic', 'foil', 'team', 'leader', 'George', 'Challenger', 'Peter', 'McCauley', 'easy', 'comraderie', 'developed', 'show', 'run', 'improved', 'writing', 'frequently', 'smaller', 'cast', 'provided', 'Season', 'Three', 'Lost', 'World', 'was', 'continuing', 'pleasure.Sadly', 'producing', 'Cliffhanger', 'end', 'Cliffhangers', 'season', 'finale', 'funding', 'ran', 'out', 'Lost', 'World', 'was', 'not', 'picked', 'up', 'fourth', 'season', 'series', 'large', 'very', 'loyal', 'fan', 'base', 'entire', 'cast', 'have', 'expressed', 'willingness', 'return', 'roles', 'frequent', 'attempts', 'revive', 'least', ""'Made-for-TV"", 'movie', 'have', 'failed', 'unlikely', 'fate', 'Professor', 'Challenger', 'band', 'adventurers', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'resolved.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Season', '3', 'will', 'complete', 'cherished', 'collection', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Lost', 'World', 'buying', 'collection', 'will', 'provide', 'most', 'exciting', 'romantic', 'episodes', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'fantasy', 'series', 'will', 'certainly', 'whet', 'appetite', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'available', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'adventure', 'have', 'store']",Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World - Season Three

Somehow the show became a ritual viewing, so much so that when it jumped channels and moved to an even more inconvenient time (!), I made an effort to tune in. Season 2 was one of those ""this is so bad it's good"" guilty pleasures. The actors play their parts well and the stories became ever more ridiculous, and paradoxically all that much better. Season 3 though..... contract disputes limited David Orth and Jennifer O'Dell to a handful of episodes. O'Dell is definitely missed. Her replacement, Finn, from a post-apocalyptic future never really fits in with the cast. The unforgiveable flaw of Season 3 is its cliffhanger ending. While a good episode, the series' subsequent cancellation makes it very bittersweet. I hate only getting half the story.

It is a pity it did not continue since I believe they have more people watching it now than when it originally aired. The stories sometimes seem a little far fetched with aliens and a woman from the future, but it won't disappoint you. Fans of the first two seasons will definitely want to get this third season. Unfortunately two of the characters, Veronica and Ned, are not seen as much this season since the Australian government imposed higher taxes since they were not Australian actors. Lord John Roxton and Marguerite Krux mainly carry the show in this third season, but they are excellent and the rest of the support cast and guest stars are great. Once again the 22 episodes on 6 slender cased discs are well worth owning. Besides with the cliffhanger at the end of the second season who can wait. I pre-ordered mine here at Amazon again since they have it for the best price. I highly recommend the entire series for the whole family.

I belive that's how you spell here last name, and John Roxton.After his time in the supernatural world, Ned Malone left to seek self awareness, and Veronica went off on her own adventure.But fear not, more characters make their prescence, as a new woman by the name of Finn was accepted by the three after Challenger perfected a time travelling machine that transported the three into the world right after World War three. After some brief fights with bounty hunters, who have cool cars I must add, Finn comes to join them.The episodes are unique, besides the time travelling machine theres also: One where a demon is dug up inside a jar by another expedition and leads to a lot of confusion of who is possessed and how.There is also one where a meteorite falls and almost causes a new ice age, along with bringing an alien race that are frozen but are alive. I liked the idea of how the people lived, but it was a little too creepy, for me that is.More episodes show Margarites past and her real reason why she came to the Lost World, a WW1 pilot who has survived with a case full of metal that all the main explorers seem to have a unique bond to.And a showdown by a returning Veronica and a swordsman who claims to be the protector of the plateau. At least I think he said he was the protector. It was also great seeing Veronica and Finn meet for the first time. A harsh introduction, but they became friends.This season also has the perfect ending of the romance between Margarite and John Roxton while they were trapped inside a cave. It thought it was a really good ending to the suspense of whether or not they would hook up.With a great cast, some unique shows, most of  which I didn't name, and a big cliffhanger of an ending, you should definately add this to your Lost World Collection.",5,The Lost World Season Three has the ultimate cliffhanger!,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,2159,"['may', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'right', 'big', 'question', 'was', 'asked', 'what', 'was', 'Veronica', 'reason', 'coming', 'plateau', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'weould', 'leave', 'millions', 'fans', 'including', 'answer', 'been', 'three', 'years', 'most', 'season', 'only', 'three', 'main', 'explorers', 'left', 'are', 'George', 'Challenger', 'Margarite', 'Krux', 'belive', 'how', 'spell', 'here', 'last', 'name', 'John', 'Roxton.After', 'time', 'supernatural', 'world', 'Ned', 'Malone', 'left', 'seek', 'self', 'awareness', 'Veronica', 'went', 'off', 'own', 'adventure.But', 'fear', 'not', 'more', 'characters', 'make', 'prescence', 'new', 'woman', 'name', 'Finn', 'was', 'accepted', 'three', 'Challenger', 'perfected', 'time', 'travelling', 'machine', 'transported', 'three', 'world', 'right', 'World', 'War', 'three', 'brief', 'fights', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'who', 'have', 'cool', 'cars', 'must', 'add', 'Finn', 'join', 'them.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'unique', 'time', 'travelling', 'machine', 'theres', 'also', 'One', 'where', 'demon', 'dug', 'up', 'jar', 'expedition', 'lot', 'confusion', 'who', 'possessed', 'also', 'one', 'where', 'meteorite', 'almost', 'new', 'ice', 'age', 'bringing', 'alien', 'race', 'are', 'frozen', 'are', 'alive', 'liked', 'idea', 'how', 'people', 'lived', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'creepy', 'is.More', 'episodes', 'show', 'Margarites', 'past', 'real', 'reason', 'why', 'came', 'Lost', 'World', 'WW1', 'pilot', 'who', 'survived', 'case', 'full', 'metal', 'main', 'explorers', 'seem', 'have', 'unique', 'bond', 'to.And', 'showdown', 'returning', 'Veronica', 'swordsman', 'who', 'be', 'protector', 'plateau', 'least', 'think', 'said', 'was', 'protector', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'seeing', 'Veronica', 'Finn', 'meet', 'first', 'time', 'harsh', 'introduction', 'became', 'friends.This', 'season', 'also', 'perfect', 'ending', 'romance', 'Margarite', 'John', 'Roxton', 'were', 'trapped', 'cave', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'ending', 'suspense', 'not', 'would', 'hook', 'up.With', 'great', 'cast', 'unique', 'shows', 'most', 'did', ""n't"", 'name', 'big', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'should', 'definately', 'add', 'Lost', 'World', 'Collection']",Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World - Season Three

I barely ended it to satisfy myself that I whatched all the series without any skip!and in other episode, there was not really a logic story, I hoped that they used primitive visual effects instead of that freak stories. they ruined the series in season 3 and it was predictable that they couldnt go on any further!But worst or best, it was not decent they abandon the series without a certain end!my suggestion is, they could gather the stars one more time and produce 90 minues show as the series finale. they owe fans at least that favor!",3,season 3 ruind the entire series!,1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,1232,"['got', 'show', 'season', '1', 'liked', 'cover', 'bought', 'was', 'cheesy', 'time', 'got', 'better', 'end', 'one', 'season', 'decieded', 'buy', 'two', 'season', '2', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'visuals', 'wer', 'decent', 'enough', 'season', '3', 'really', 'dissapointed', 'episodes', 'had', 'worst', 'most', 'childis', 'stories', 'person', 'can', 'imagine', 'once', 'thought', 'what', 'are', 'producers', '8', 'had', ""n't"", 'enough', 'childhood', 'transefring', 'time', 'place', 'same', 'actors', 'actresses', 'different', 'phenomenas', 'was', 'acceptable', 'once', 'seemed', 'liked', 'continue', 'worst', 'episode', 'was', 'westen', 'episode', 'barely', 'ended', 'satisfy', 'whatched', 'series', 'skip', 'other', 'episode', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'logic', 'story', 'hoped', 'used', 'primitive', 'visual', 'effects', 'instead', 'freak', 'stories', 'ruined', 'series', 'season', '3', 'was', 'predictable', 'couldnt', 'go', 'further', 'worst', 'best', 'was', 'not', 'decent', 'abandon', 'series', 'certain', 'end', 'suggestion', 'could', 'gather', 'stars', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'produce', '90', 'minues', 'show', 'series', 'finale', 'owe', 'fans', 'least', 'favor']",Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World - Season Three
