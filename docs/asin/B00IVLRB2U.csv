Wirdel,"[2, 2]","I don't know what drug some of the hater reviewers on here are on...maybe their Beatles fans who can't stand any other British Invasion band get credit. The DC5 were a good band, Dave was a great drummer, producer and manager. It IS true that while they wrote some really GREAT songs in their day, they could not adjust to the more sophisticated lyrics of the psychedelic era. BUT, in their day...1964-1965...they were as good as anything the Beatles or Stones were doing. This rockumentary has been long overdue. Now it's time for someone to get on the ball and do a film about the Searchers.",5,"The DC5 were a good band, Dave was a great drummer",1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,593,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'drug', 'hater', 'reviewers', 'here', 'are', 'maybe', 'Beatles', 'fans', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'other', 'British', 'Invasion', 'band', 'get', 'credit', 'DC5', 'were', 'good', 'band', 'Dave', 'was', 'great', 'drummer', 'producer', 'manager', 'true', 'wrote', 'really', 'GREAT', 'songs', 'day', 'could', 'not', 'adjust', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'lyrics', 'psychedelic', 'era', 'BUT', 'day', '1964-1965', 'were', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'Beatles', 'Stones', 'were', 'doing', 'rockumentary', 'been', 'long', 'overdue', 'Now', 'time', 'someone', 'get', 'ball', 'do', 'film', 'Searchers']",N/A
1694942,A33Z8L75OXCP78,B00IVLRB2U,Eric Schenk,"[86, 104]","Dave Clark was certainly one of the most brilliant businessmen in the history of rock music.  But he has no interest in having the true story of the Dave Clark 5 told and so in the guise of such a story, he, instead simply demonstrates what an egomaniac he was.  The Dave Clark 5 was the first great ""boy band.""  It was not a real group.  Rather, Dave Clark hired four musicians, rehearsed them for several months and then had them record about 12 great pop singles between 1964 and 1967.  Dave Clark was a better than average drummer and a great record producer, but the only reason he made it as a pop star was that he lucked into Mike Smith, one of the great pop/rock vocalists of the mid-60s who also happened to have a real talent for writing catchy pop songs.  Dave Clark simply put his name on any song written by any other member of the band, and the bulk of the hits were by Mike Smith.This documentary pretends the DC5 was a real group, similar to the Beatles, the Stones, or the Who.  This is utter nonsense.  Dave paid the other members a salary keeping all meaningful earnings for himself. Indeed, despite the fact that the ""group"" sold millions of records, shortly after Dave ended the group, none of the other members made more than a small percentage of the millions the group's music generated.  (As a result, Mike Smith died with an estate worth perhaps $100,000.  Apparently, however Lenny Davidson and Rick Huxley had successful second careers -- which Dave neglects to mention.) And Dave's control of the masters and publishing rights prevented Mike Smith from making any money because Dave refused to allow any of the group's music to be released for twenty years.As you watch this movie, and hear the group spoken of as one of the three great British rock groups of the 1960s, consider the fact that the group was not admitted into the Rock n' Roll hall of fame for almost twenty years after they first became eligible.  The reason is two fold: (1) they were not anywhere near as good as the front line groups and (2)  those inside the rock music establishment, must have known that this was not a real group and Dave Clark was the sort of smarmy business man that Traffic was singing about in ""Low Spark of High Heel Boys.""I was a BIG fan of the DC5's singles in the mid 60s.  They were infectious, high energy pop music.  But to claim, the DC5 were in the same category as the Beatles or Stones is equivalent to claiming that Bon Jovi was in the same echelon as Led Zeppelin. The only thing that this movie gets right is that Mike Smith never got his due as a great rock vocalist. (It must be mentioned that when Mike Smith toured in the years before his tragic accident, Dave Clark threatened to sue if Mike Smith mentioned the DC5 in any advertisements for Mike's performances.)Perhaps someday, someone will be able to pull Mike Smith's legacy out from the clutches of Dave Clark.  It is worth noting one of the cruelest aspects of this saga is that the DC5 was actually to be admitted a year earlier, but the group's induction was posponed.  Mike Smith passed away just days before the ceremony and so did not live to see himself properly lionized.Dave Clark has much to be proud of, but the fact that he was not willing to have this film made independently demonstrates his fear of what the truth would reveal about him.  I wasn't surprised that one of the great schlockmeisters of all time, Gene Simmons in full Kiss make up, was one of the featured talking heads.  What confused me was the willingness of Bruce Springsteen and Steve Van Zandt to sing Dave Clark's praises.  It was troubling to hear one of the major rock figures known for his utter integrity celebrate one who was lacking in that quality. One hint was that it was evident that the Boss was unaware that Dave Clark had little, if anything, to do with the writing of the group's great songs.Perhaps one day, Dave Clark will allow a dvd of the DC5's live performances to be released.  That is what the other four deserve and what will allow the group's fans to enjoy the true legacy: an hour of amazing pop music.",1,An utterly disingenuous celebration of Dave Clark by Dave Clark,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,4108,"['Dave', 'Clark', 'was', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'businessmen', 'history', 'rock', 'music', 'interest', 'having', 'true', 'story', 'Dave', 'Clark', '5', 'told', 'so', 'guise', 'such', 'story', 'instead', 'simply', 'what', 'egomaniac', 'was', 'Dave', 'Clark', '5', 'was', 'first', 'great', 'boy', 'band', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'group', 'Rather', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'hired', 'four', 'musicians', 'rehearsed', 'several', 'months', 'then', 'had', 'record', '12', 'great', 'pop', 'singles', '1964', '1967', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'was', 'better', 'average', 'drummer', 'great', 'record', 'producer', 'only', 'reason', 'made', 'pop', 'star', 'was', 'lucked', 'Mike', 'Smith', 'one', 'great', 'pop/rock', 'vocalists', 'mid-60s', 'who', 'also', 'happened', 'have', 'real', 'talent', 'writing', 'catchy', 'pop', 'songs', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'simply', 'put', 'name', 'song', 'written', 'other', 'member', 'band', 'bulk', 'hits', 'were', 'Mike', 'Smith.This', 'documentary', 'DC5', 'was', 'real', 'group', 'similar', 'Beatles', 'Stones', 'Who', 'utter', 'nonsense', 'Dave', 'paid', 'other', 'members', 'salary', 'keeping', 'meaningful', 'earnings', 'Indeed', 'fact', 'group', 'sold', 'millions', 'records', 'shortly', 'Dave', 'ended', 'group', 'none', 'other', 'members', 'made', 'more', 'small', 'percentage', 'millions', 'group', 'music', 'generated', 'result', 'Mike', 'Smith', 'died', 'estate', 'worth', 'perhaps', '100,000', 'Apparently', 'however', 'Lenny', 'Davidson', 'Rick', 'Huxley', 'had', 'successful', 'second', 'careers', 'Dave', 'neglects', 'mention', 'Dave', 'control', 'masters', 'publishing', 'rights', 'prevented', 'Mike', 'Smith', 'making', 'money', 'Dave', 'refused', 'allow', 'group', 'music', 'be', 'released', 'twenty', 'years.As', 'watch', 'movie', 'hear', 'group', 'spoken', 'one', 'three', 'great', 'British', 'rock', 'groups', '1960s', 'consider', 'fact', 'group', 'was', 'not', 'admitted', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'hall', 'fame', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'first', 'became', 'eligible', 'reason', 'two', 'fold', '1', 'were', 'not', 'anywhere', 'as', 'good', 'front', 'line', 'groups', '2', 'rock', 'music', 'establishment', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'group', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'was', 'sort', 'smarmy', 'business', 'man', 'Traffic', 'was', 'singing', 'about', 'Low', 'Spark', 'High', 'Heel', 'Boys', 'was', 'BIG', 'fan', 'DC5', 'singles', 'mid', '60s', 'were', 'infectious', 'high', 'energy', 'pop', 'music', 'claim', 'DC5', 'were', 'same', 'category', 'Beatles', 'Stones', 'equivalent', 'claiming', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'was', 'same', 'echelon', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'right', 'Mike', 'Smith', 'never', 'got', 'due', 'great', 'rock', 'vocalist', 'must', 'be', 'mentioned', 'when', 'Mike', 'Smith', 'toured', 'years', 'tragic', 'accident', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'threatened', 'sue', 'Mike', 'Smith', 'mentioned', 'DC5', 'advertisements', 'Mike', 'performances', 'Perhaps', 'someday', 'someone', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'Mike', 'Smith', 'legacy', 'clutches', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'worth', 'noting', 'one', 'cruelest', 'aspects', 'saga', 'DC5', 'was', 'actually', 'be', 'admitted', 'year', 'earlier', 'group', 'induction', 'was', 'posponed', 'Mike', 'Smith', 'passed', 'away', 'just', 'days', 'ceremony', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'see', 'properly', 'lionized.Dave', 'Clark', 'much', 'be', 'proud', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'willing', 'have', 'film', 'made', 'independently', 'fear', 'what', 'truth', 'would', 'reveal', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'one', 'great', 'schlockmeisters', 'time', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'full', 'Kiss', 'make', 'up', 'was', 'one', 'featured', 'talking', 'heads', 'What', 'confused', 'was', 'willingness', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'Steve', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'sing', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'praises', 'was', 'troubling', 'hear', 'one', 'major', 'rock', 'figures', 'known', 'utter', 'integrity', 'celebrate', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'lacking', 'quality', 'One', 'hint', 'was', 'was', 'evident', 'Boss', 'was', 'unaware', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'had', 'little', 'anything', 'do', 'writing', 'group', 'great', 'songs.Perhaps', 'one', 'day', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'will', 'allow', 'dvd', 'DC5', 'live', 'performances', 'be', 'released', 'what', 'other', 'four', 'deserve', 'what', 'will', 'allow', 'group', 'fans', 'enjoy', 'true', 'legacy', 'hour', 'amazing', 'pop', 'music']",N/A

Unlike other '60s British rock ensembles, they have not been seen on Ed Sullivan Show retrospectives or other music retrospectives the past 3-4 decades and with extremely few and far between CD releases, awareness has shrunk over the years and the Dave Clark Five's music is rarely heard anymore.Unfortunately it is a fact that Dave Clark has sat on the group's albums and rare recordings for decades instead of putting them out on proper CDs and boxed sets. iTunes is fine for the masses but the compressed audio certainly not as good as WAV files on CD so hopefully this long-overdue documentary will signal a more open-minded attitude on Clark who has kept footage of the group from the airwaves for years as well, so much so that on top of virtually no CDs, many people have forgotten about the great group and younger folk have no idea.This documentary is stuffed with mostly older interviews but at least gives a gasp of the greatness this group offered alongside the Beatles before the DC5 disappeared from the public consciousness unnecessarily due to Mr. Clark's misguided business approach of near total withdrawal of their important and impressive body of work.",3,Long Overdue Documentary - Self Produced by Dave Clark,1397174400,"04 11, 2014",2014,1332,"['compelling', 'program', 'other', 'reason', 'sad', 'reality', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'Five', 'have', 'been', 'public', 'eyes', 'ears', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'other', ""'60s"", 'British', 'rock', 'ensembles', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Show', 'other', 'music', 'past', '3-4', 'decades', 'extremely', 'few', 'far', 'CD', 'releases', 'awareness', 'shrunk', 'years', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'Five', 'music', 'rarely', 'heard', 'anymore.Unfortunately', 'fact', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'sat', 'group', 'albums', 'rare', 'recordings', 'decades', 'instead', 'putting', 'out', 'proper', 'CDs', 'boxed', 'sets', 'iTunes', 'fine', 'masses', 'compressed', 'audio', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'WAV', 'files', 'CD', 'so', 'hopefully', 'long-overdue', 'documentary', 'will', 'signal', 'more', 'open-minded', 'attitude', 'Clark', 'who', 'kept', 'footage', 'group', 'airwaves', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'much', 'top', 'virtually', 'CDs', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'forgotten', 'great', 'group', 'younger', 'folk', 'have', 'idea.This', 'documentary', 'stuffed', 'mostly', 'older', 'interviews', 'least', 'gasp', 'greatness', 'group', 'offered', 'Beatles', 'DC5', 'disappeared', 'public', 'consciousness', 'unnecessarily', 'due', 'Mr.', 'Clark', 'misguided', 'business', 'approach', 'near', 'total', 'withdrawal', 'important', 'impressive', 'body', 'work']",N/A

1694946,A79U01AE98EV8,B00IVLRB2U,MACLEAR,"[21, 34]","It is indicative of the film that the cover boasts Clark's full face front and center with the other four half-faced on either side - side men indeed.  Clark was never a great drummer - he was serviceable.  On the other hand Mike Smith was a great singer who goes pretty much unsung here.This is a poorly directed film which mostly consists of the band lipsynching merrily away on this or that television show.  I don't think there is one song sung in front of a live audience in any type of concert hall, there are no extended interviews of any kind with any of the sidemen and there is much too much of that well-regarded cultural critic Whoppi Goldberg whose credentials as a music analyst must have passed me by.  She earned the moniker &#34;Whoppi&#34; because of her penchant for breaking wind in public.  Knowing this may be the reason she looks like she smells bad.But back to Clark, who this botched film is an ode to.  You would think the man would want a few minutes of the time alloted for us to learn what became of the other four after the break up (which somehow did not garner the same press as the Beatles').  He is content to keep them in the shadows wallowing in anonymity.  And the musical he boasts of - &#34;Time&#34; - from what we see of it, and mercifully is is relatively short - it is a howler with Olivier reduced to a sculpted head murmuring platitudes a four year old would find embarassing.  One needn't wonder why it never made it to the States - it would have drowned in the ocean by its own grandiosity and gaudiness.One of the many problems this dud boasts is its inclusion of clips of the Beatles which is analogous to watching a documentary of Milli Vanilli with clips of Michael jackson thrown in - one wants to hit the stop button and load in &#34;A Hard Day's Night&#34; - one wishes the four moptops could spend more time on the screen.

Hornick Jr.,"[8, 9]","Hello everyoneI thought the Dave Clark Five dvd was great and as a long time fan, I was grateful that Mr. Clark finally released something for us fans as we have been starving for something for too many years. The story was very interesting but I was hoping it would have been solely about the DC5. I also wish people like Lenny Davidson and Bruce Fleming (their photographer) had been a part of this. I was a little disappointed with the second disc as I had hoped a lot more DC5 performances had been included and less of the interviews from the Time era.Mr. Clark, I hope you are reading this and are sincere in your recent interviews about releasing your music as a possible box set so let me give you some suggestions as to what an average DC5 fan would love to see. If you are going to release a box set, please do it right and let me give you some suggestions. First, find copies of the box sets for Ricky Nelson called The American Dream, or For You which were released by Big Bear. This is the way a box set should be. Lots of cd's and a book that is worth the price of the box alone. The book had lots of pictures and recording dates of every song on the cd's.Next, The Moody Blues released in 2013, a box set called TImeless FLight. This was in 3 formats. A 2 cd set. A larger 4 cd set. Finally, a massive 17 disc set with a great book. Several of the discs in this were dvd's. I would love to see a massive DC5 set like this, no matter what the cost.For your music, go back to the beginning with I Knew It All The Time and the rest of the early songs with the list of personnel on the songs and recording dates. Then you can start with the classic DC5 lineup songs. Hopefully we could hear your band's version of Twist And Shout and perhaps other unreleased songs. Take us on an unforgettable journey all the way up to 1970 with this.Next, we need more dvd's. Do this up right and get Lenny Davidson, Bruce Fleming and possibly your recording engineers in front of the cameras for their memories and to introduce more dvd material. What would I personally love to see? Here goes:A rerelease of Glad All Over Again which came out in 1993 and was way too short at only 38 minutes. You must release the complete Hold On special and also Live At T.J.'s which had Phil Spector and Sal Mineo on it.A must have is the complete Ed Sullivan performances with Ed's introductions on them just so we can see that your group made 18 appearances on there.We would love to see your group on the NME Pollwinner's Concert from 1964. It would be also nice to see lots more of the band's home movies with you and Mr. Davidson narrating them.We would also love to see the Shindig, Hullabaloo, Dean Martin performances and more DC5 from Ready Steady Go. I dont care if I have to sit through Glad All Over 10 times, we want to see them.Your final years from 1968-70 need to be seen. I got the dvd sets of This Is Tom Jones. Imagine my disappointment Mr. Clark, when I watched these and one of Tom's shows had the DC5 listed as guests but your performance was cut out and the only thing I have seen from your 2 appearances on Tom's show was the &#34;time for a commercial break&#34; clip on your dvd. Mr. Clark, please put out on dvd, your 2 appearances on Tom's show along with Tom's introductions and the John Davidson 1969 show which your band was on. Plus the Beat Club appearances and your final performance on Top Of The Pops in 1970 with Jimmy Saville's introduction.Any chance of us fans seeing the full color clip of Wild Weekend on the dvd and a complete Try Too Hard film which is always cut in the middle as was shown on the bonus disc of this dvd set?Finally, what about the first book on the DC5? May I suggest a photo book of Bruce Fleming's photos with commentary by you, Mr. Davidson and Mr. Fleming elaborately done by a wonderful book publisher like Genesis Publications?This is what an average fan like myself would love to see released by you. Is this too much to ask?Joey",5,Great but could have been a whole lot better.,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,3982,"['Hello', 'thought', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'Five', 'dvd', 'was', 'great', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'was', 'grateful', 'Mr.', 'Clark', 'finally', 'released', 'something', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'starving', 'something', 'too', 'many', 'years', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'solely', 'DC5', 'also', 'wish', 'people', 'Lenny', 'Davidson', 'Bruce', 'Fleming', 'photographer', 'had', 'been', 'part', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'second', 'disc', 'had', 'hoped', 'lot', 'more', 'DC5', 'performances', 'had', 'been', 'included', 'less', 'interviews', 'Time', 'era.Mr', 'Clark', 'hope', 'are', 'reading', 'are', 'sincere', 'recent', 'interviews', 'releasing', 'music', 'possible', 'box', 'set', 'so', 'let', 'give', 'suggestions', 'what', 'average', 'DC5', 'fan', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'are', 'going', 'release', 'box', 'set', 'please', 'do', 'right', 'let', 'give', 'suggestions', 'First', 'find', 'copies', 'box', 'sets', 'Ricky', 'Nelson', 'called', 'American', 'Dream', 'were', 'released', 'Big', 'Bear', 'way', 'box', 'set', 'should', 'be', 'Lots', 'cd', 'book', 'price', 'box', 'alone', 'book', 'had', 'lots', 'pictures', 'recording', 'dates', 'song', ""cd's.Next"", 'Moody', 'Blues', 'released', '2013', 'box', 'set', 'called', 'TImeless', 'FLight', 'was', '3', 'formats', '2', 'cd', 'set', 'A', 'larger', '4', 'cd', 'set', 'Finally', 'massive', '17', 'disc', 'set', 'great', 'book', 'Several', 'discs', 'were', 'dvd', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'massive', 'DC5', 'set', 'matter', 'what', 'cost.For', 'music', 'go', 'back', 'beginning', 'Knew', 'Time', 'rest', 'early', 'songs', 'list', 'personnel', 'songs', 'recording', 'dates', 'Then', 'can', 'start', 'classic', 'DC5', 'lineup', 'songs', 'Hopefully', 'could', 'hear', 'band', 'version', 'Twist', 'Shout', 'perhaps', 'other', 'unreleased', 'songs', 'Take', 'unforgettable', 'journey', 'way', '1970', 'this.Next', 'need', 'more', 'dvd', 'Do', 'up', 'right', 'get', 'Lenny', 'Davidson', 'Bruce', 'Fleming', 'possibly', 'recording', 'engineers', 'front', 'cameras', 'memories', 'introduce', 'more', 'dvd', 'material', 'What', 'would', 'personally', 'love', 'see', 'Here', 'rerelease', 'Glad', 'All', 'Over', 'Again', 'came', 'out', '1993', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'only', '38', 'minutes', 'must', 'release', 'complete', 'Hold', 'special', 'also', 'Live', 'T.J.', 'had', 'Phil', 'Spector', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'it.A', 'must', 'have', 'complete', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Ed', 'introductions', 'just', 'can', 'see', 'group', 'made', '18', 'appearances', 'there.We', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'group', 'NME', 'Pollwinner', 'Concert', '1964', 'would', 'be', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'lots', 'more', 'band', 'home', 'movies', 'Mr.', 'Davidson', 'narrating', 'them.We', 'would', 'also', 'love', 'see', 'Shindig', 'Hullabaloo', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'performances', 'more', 'DC5', 'Ready', 'Steady', 'Go', 'dont', 'care', 'have', 'sit', 'Glad', 'All', 'Over', '10', 'times', 'want', 'see', 'them.Your', 'final', 'years', '1968-70', 'need', 'be', 'seen', 'got', 'dvd', 'sets', 'Is', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'Imagine', 'disappointment', 'Mr.', 'Clark', 'when', 'watched', 'one', 'Tom', 'shows', 'had', 'DC5', 'listed', 'guests', 'performance', 'was', 'cut', 'out', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'seen', '2', 'appearances', 'Tom', 'show', 'was', '34', 'time', 'commercial', 'break', '34', 'clip', 'dvd', 'Mr.', 'Clark', 'please', 'put', 'out', 'dvd', '2', 'appearances', 'Tom', 'show', 'Tom', 'introductions', 'John', 'Davidson', '1969', 'show', 'band', 'was', 'Beat', 'Club', 'appearances', 'final', 'performance', 'Top', 'Pops', '1970', 'Jimmy', 'Saville', 'introduction.Any', 'chance', 'fans', 'seeing', 'full', 'color', 'clip', 'Wild', 'Weekend', 'dvd', 'complete', 'Try', 'Too', 'Hard', 'film', 'always', 'cut', 'middle', 'was', 'shown', 'bonus', 'disc', 'dvd', 'set', 'Finally', 'what', 'first', 'book', 'DC5', 'May', 'suggest', 'photo', 'book', 'Bruce', 'Fleming', 'photos', 'commentary', 'Mr.', 'Davidson', 'Mr.', 'Fleming', 'elaborately', 'done', 'wonderful', 'book', 'publisher', 'Genesis', 'Publications', 'what', 'average', 'fan', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'released', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'Joey']",N/A

I'm ordering one on amazon.com for my gal.  between the two discs we have over 4 hours of content.  Some of this I have owned on bad bootleg compilations so seeing it in first rate state is a revelation.  After decades of languishing in vaults this is such a treat for any of us baby boomers who remember the DC5.  I don't want to get into political debates like some reviewing this as to Dave Clark's business practices... I'M REVIEWING this product.... and for me the only thing better would be if 4 hours of The Kinks was to be unearthed and put out on BR.... these guys were so essential to the British Invasion , yet as Bruce Springsteen so accurately notes... they were much bigger sounding that the Beatles and the Stones.  Mike Smith's vocals are unique and instantly identifiable yet, when I play DC5 for friends they have NO idea he's British.... you've heard many of their songs on commercials and the radio and likely not even known who you were listening to if you are not a fan.This is a TREASURE ..... if you are a fan you shall not be disappointed.  This was done right with loads of bonus content.... and deserving of a higher price.EXTRA NOTE:  I don't like offering up spoilers in my reviews , but in the nearly 2 hours of bonus footage there is a wonderful ""Out Take"" interview with Mike Smith , that is frankly worth the purchase for me alone!!",5,FIVE stars for the DC5 .. from an owner!,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,1488,"['Picked', 'up', 'early', 'local', 'record', 'store', 'thank', 'goodness', 'have', 'one', 'WOW', 'WOW', 'WOW', 'WOW', 'WOW', 'what', 'gift', ""'m"", 'ordering', 'one', 'amazon.com', 'gal', 'two', 'discs', 'have', 'over', '4', 'hours', 'content', 'have', 'owned', 'bad', 'bootleg', 'compilations', 'so', 'seeing', 'first', 'rate', 'state', 'revelation', 'decades', 'languishing', 'vaults', 'such', 'treat', 'baby', 'boomers', 'who', 'remember', 'DC5', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'political', 'debates', 'reviewing', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'business', 'practices', ""'M"", 'REVIEWING', 'product', 'only', 'thing', 'better', 'would', 'be', '4', 'hours', 'Kinks', 'was', 'be', 'unearthed', 'put', 'out', 'BR', 'guys', 'were', 'so', 'essential', 'British', 'Invasion', 'yet', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'so', 'accurately', 'notes', 'were', 'much', 'bigger', 'sounding', 'Beatles', 'Stones', 'Mike', 'Smith', 'vocals', 'are', 'unique', 'instantly', 'identifiable', 'yet', 'when', 'play', 'DC5', 'friends', 'have', 'idea', 'British', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'many', 'songs', 'commercials', 'radio', 'likely', 'not', 'even', 'known', 'who', 'were', 'listening', 'are', 'not', 'fan.This', 'TREASURE', '..', 'are', 'fan', 'shall', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'was', 'done', 'right', 'loads', 'bonus', 'content', 'deserving', 'higher', 'price.EXTRA', 'NOTE', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'offering', 'up', 'spoilers', 'reviews', 'nearly', '2', 'hours', 'bonus', 'footage', 'wonderful', 'Out', 'Take', 'interview', 'Mike', 'Smith', 'frankly', 'purchase', 'alone']",N/A
1694951,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00IVLRB2U,Robert Badgley,"[4, 4]","It has been long over due,but I am glad(all over) that this DVD has finally appeared.History and especially musical history, tends to morph,twist and get re-written in the most fascinating of ways.The British Invasion,and specifically The DC5's place in it,has been so marginalized, they have been almost(and in some quarters) completely forgotten.Mr.Clark has finally produced this wonderful two disc set and tries to set the record straight.On the first disc we have an approximately two hour documentary,originally shown on PBS in the States,laying out exactly what the group accomplished,highlighted with some wonderful footage from vintage TV shows of the 60s,showing what the group did best....playing.The screams of the fans and the sheer numbers show just what a drawing card this group was in their heyday.While taking us step by step from the beginning of their career through to their eventual break up(strictly voluntary),it is augmented with interviews by the likes of Paul McCartney,Elton John,Sharon Osbourne,Gene Simmons(in full Kiss makeup),Bruce Springsteen and many,many more.We learn,among other things, that Mr.Clark not only personally steered the group (he was very image conscious) but produced them,managed them and obtained a personal plane for them to travel the world in.He also owned their publishing rights and asked for four times the going rate for their music in the beginning,got it and in three years the song masters came back to him.It is amusing to hear folks like McCartney and John say they regret not having done what Dave did,because it would have saved them alot of money in lawsuits,which didn't always yield them satisfactory results.While some of the material covered might be old hat to the average fan,there are alot of new things that Mr.Clark sheds light on that I was not even aware of.And the videos that you see alone are worth watching it for.They sure brought alot of memories back to me.But as my title says I believe Mr.Clark is trying to cater not only to the old fans,but find a new audience who may not have heard of the group before,or know very little.What better way to get tremendous exposure and reach a new audience,than to have your documentary seen on PBS? Mr.Clark's business savvy comes to the fore once more folks!The second disc on this set contains many impressive extras,which includes,outtakes,alternate DC5 performances,interviews with participants of the Hold On special,footage from that,the Hits in Action short,their Royal Performance set(singing 19 Days and Georgia-they could REALLY play live and fantastically well!),and a special section on Mr Clarks smash London play success TIME,with interviews with many of the artists involved in the recording of its soundtrack such as Dionne Warwick,Cliff Richards,Stevie Wonder,Julian Lennon,Freddie Mercury,etc,its premier night and an interview with Sir Lawrence Olivier(it played to over a million folks and sold over 12 million records!).The set also includes snippets from the DC5's induction into the Rock n Roll Hall of fame in 2008.If you haven't seen the full speech Mr Clark gave go to You Tube and give it a look see.That was by far the classiest and well spoken speech I have ever heard at that institution.And it was beautifully pre-framed by Tom Hanks.I hope three things come out of this DVD release A)Musical history is rewritten to reflect the way it really was and the DC5s proper place restored B)We get a new CD release.Not a another greatest hits,but either a release of ALL the groups material,or at least a CD with songs that have not been released up until this point in time.As you listen to the documentary you hear some of the groups instrumental-only songs playing in the background.I thought gosh,I'd settle for just an instrumental album.And C)A book.This DVD proves that there is SO much unwritten and not said/known about the group.A well written book about the group is something that is long overdue and this DVD just screams that point.In conclusion,this two DVD set is as welcome as pay day.The DC5 have always represented the best of what 60s music had to offer.They were a clean cut,drug free, straight ahead group with a different sound than anyone else's.It is probably what got them sidelined in the history books(they didn't fit the sex,drugs,and rock and roll profile),but it is what got them into my heart(and countless others) where they have stayed ever since.Mr.Clark I salute you and the guys for the countless hours of pure joy and excitement you gave(and still give) this old fan of yours.You are gone but not forgotten by any stretch.Let's hope you can gain some NEW fans with this DVD set.",5,Mr.Clark shoots for a broader audience to set the record straight!,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,4666,"['been', 'long', 'due', 'am',

1694952,A1537KCD6LBWGI,B00IVLRB2U,steve_manassas,"[4, 4]","I originally saw this documentary on PBS' GREAT PERFORMANCES, and was so impressed with it that I immediately pre-ordered the DVD. The documentary is an excellent history of The Dave Clark Five, with plenty of archival footage, performance clips, and interviews with original DC5 fans, as well as celebrity admirers such as Sir Paul McCartney (I don't know if Dave's fellow drummer Ringo was asked, but he may have declined), Sir Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, Gene Simmons (who should have left the KISS makeup at home - we know who you are, Gene), Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, the late Sir Laurence Olivier, the late Mike Smith, and a few people that I could have done without - Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, and Caryn Johnson (a.k.a. Whoopi Goldberg).The documentary on Disc 1 runs a little over 2 hours, about 15 minutes longer than the PBS special. The bonus disc includes six DC5 sections: interview outtakes; unedited performance segments (which are, unfortunately, lip-synced); a segment called ""You Can't Win Them All"" (more interview outtakes); footage from Dave's promo film HOLD ON - IT'S THE DAVE CLARK FIVE; the complete 15-minute promo film HITS IN ACTION (including one segment, set to the song ""Come Home,"" that was rejected by the BBC's TOP OF THE POPS for being too pornographic; it's not even close, not even by '60s standards); and the DC5's unedited Royal Command Performance from 1966. Also included on Disc 2 are several additional segments about Dave Clark's post-Five West End musical, TIME, which is also covered extensively in the main documentary. In addition, the menus have an interesting mashup version of the DC5's first U.S. hit, ""Glad All Over.""I have an additional request for Dave Clark. Until now, DC5 fans have been short-changed, with only three official releases of the group's music on Compact Disc: 1993'sThe History of the Dave Clark FiveandDave Clark Five/Glad All Over Again, and 2008'sThe Dave Clark Five The Hits, all of which are out of print. I know most of the catalog is available on iTunes, but most of us older fans don't download. There are also ""gray market"" compilations of his hits with stereo mixes, one of which I purchased from an Amazon Merchant in 2006, but the page is no longer active on the site.  But none of the DC5's original albums have been officially issued on CD, though they have been bootlegged. This needs to be corrected. All 12 of the U.S. Epic albums, and all of the U.K. Columbia Graphophone albums, should be released on CD in their entirety, in both mono and stereo, plus a PAST MASTERS/MONO MASTERS-type compilation of non-LP singles. The Abbey Road remastering team, who has done such a superb job with the Beatles, Lennon, McCartney, and Apple Records remasters, would do equally as well with the DC5. Another good choice would be the Sony Legacy remastering team; perhaps it's time for Dave to forget old grudges and finish his career where it started - on Epic Records (the Columbia Graphophone trademark was transferred from EMI to Sony in 1992). A.J. Reid, Epic's head man, would be overjoyed.I'd also like to see a CD/DVD release of the Dave Clark musicalDave Clark's Time...the Album. Because the vinyl album was issued in the mid-'80s, when Compact Discs were in their infancy, I don't think that TIME was ever issued on CD; and if a filmed or taped performance of the show exists, a DVD would be great too. From what I saw in the documentary, TIME appears to be very interesting and entertaining.Five stars for this documentary.
