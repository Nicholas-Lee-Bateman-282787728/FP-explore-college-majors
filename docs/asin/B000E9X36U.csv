970996,A20KTEN5L0CPL7,B000E9X36U,Brian Barkley,"[60, 69]","This DVD is an hour-long presentation on the history of the English Bible. The viewer will meet most of the historical figures responsible for bringing us the Bible as we know and love it today: Wycliffe, Hus, Gutenberg, Colet, Erasmus, Tyndale, Luther and so on. He will see some of the locations important to the history of the Bible, such as the Wittenberg door and Martin Luther's study. He will learn about the earliest English translations, in the Old World and in the New.There are many amazing facts worked into the presentation. Dr. Lampe shows a scroll that is 1000 years old, and tells the viewer that it is word-for-word the same as the text of the Dead Sea Scrolls that were written a full millennium before.Being reminded of the blood that was shed to bring the Bible to common folk like myself, makes me consider just how flippantly I treat the Scriptures. Do I really have a sense of how privileged I am to have not just one Bible but an entire stack of them in many outstanding translations? And do I thank God for the faithful men and women who gave their lives that I can have unlimited access to His Word?At Greatsite.com the advertisement for this video says, ""Hundreds of Church Sunday School classes and Christian home-schoolers use it as part of their curriculum."" I would agree that this presentation would be useful for those purposes. It would make a valuable addition to a church, school or even public library. It would also make a great gift. And of course it is also a valuable addition to a personal library.I very much enjoyed this video and am sure to watch it again. I recommend it.",5,The best documentary ever produced on the history of the Bible,1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,1617,"['DVD', 'hour-long', 'presentation', 'history', 'English', 'Bible', 'viewer', 'will', 'meet', 'most', 'historical', 'figures', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'Bible', 'know', 'love', 'today', 'Wycliffe', 'Hus', 'Gutenberg', 'Colet', 'Erasmus', 'Tyndale', 'Luther', 'so', 'will', 'see', 'locations', 'important', 'history', 'Bible', 'such', 'Wittenberg', 'door', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'study', 'will', 'learn', 'earliest', 'English', 'translations', 'Old', 'World', 'New.There', 'are', 'many', 'amazing', 'facts', 'worked', 'presentation', 'Dr.', 'Lampe', 'scroll', '1000', 'years', 'old', 'viewer', 'word-for-word', 'same', 'text', 'Dead', 'Sea', 'Scrolls', 'were', 'written', 'full', 'millennium', 'before.Being', 'reminded', 'blood', 'was', 'shed', 'bring', 'Bible', 'common', 'folk', 'consider', 'just', 'how', 'flippantly', 'treat', 'Scriptures', 'Do', 'really', 'have', 'sense', 'how', 'privileged', 'am', 'have', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'Bible', 'entire', 'stack', 'many', 'outstanding', 'translations', 'do', 'thank', 'God', 'faithful', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'gave', 'lives', 'can', 'have', 'unlimited', 'access', 'Word', 'Greatsite.com', 'advertisement', 'video', 'Hundreds', 'Church', 'Sunday', 'School', 'classes', 'Christian', 'home-schoolers', 'use', 'part', 'curriculum', 'would', 'agree', 'presentation', 'would', 'be', 'useful', 'purposes', 'would', 'make', 'valuable', 'addition', 'church', 'school', 'even', 'public', 'library', 'would', 'also', 'make', 'great', 'gift', 'course', 'also', 'valuable', 'addition', 'personal', 'library.I', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'video', 'am', 'sure', 'watch', 'again', 'recommend']",N/A

The very best detail and historical background of The Bible presented here is very informative. However, I must confess that there are few errors here or may be less described statements that makes us confused. Some may think this is a Catholic presentation but not rather Craig Lampe has done best to bring the facts. Such as about the details of Apocrypha Bible: which says it was part of Septuagint and in all Bibles till in 1885 AD British and Foreign Bible Society in it's revised Version of KJV deleted the Apocrypha books till now! I was surprised to see that early printed Bibles also came with daily Bible reading schedule! Another surprising fact was : 90% of words from John Wycliffe's Bible was adapted in KJV Bible.Most interesting fact here is presented that John Wycliffe had a strong influence in reformation as it is considered very much related to Martin Luther. This documentary very clears explains how Bible loving Christians were persecuted and killed by those days 'real' church.This is one of the best resource if you want to know the true history of The Bible that we have today in our hands!",5,Very clear & Informative!,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",2014,1191,"['Today', 'watched', 'DVD', 'found', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'best', 'detail', 'historical', 'background', 'Bible', 'presented', 'here', 'very', 'informative', 'However', 'must', 'confess', 'are', 'few', 'errors', 'here', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'described', 'statements', 'confused', 'may', 'think', 'Catholic', 'presentation', 'not', 'rather', 'Craig', 'Lampe', 'done', 'best', 'bring', 'facts', 'Such', 'details', 'Apocrypha', 'Bible', 'was', 'part', 'Septuagint', 'Bibles', 'till', '1885', 'AD', 'British', 'Foreign', 'Bible', 'Society', 'revised', 'Version', 'KJV', 'deleted', 'Apocrypha', 'books', 'till', 'now', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'early', 'printed', 'Bibles', 'also', 'came', 'daily', 'Bible', 'reading', 'schedule', 'surprising', 'fact', 'was', '90', '%', 'words', 'John', 'Wycliffe', 'Bible', 'was', 'adapted', 'KJV', 'Bible.Most', 'interesting', 'fact', 'here', 'presented', 'John', 'Wycliffe', 'had', 'strong', 'influence', 'reformation', 'considered', 'very', 'much', 'related', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'documentary', 'very', 'how', 'Bible', 'loving', 'Christians', 'were', 'persecuted', 'killed', 'days', ""'real"", 'church.This', 'one', 'best', 'resource', 'want', 'know', 'true', 'history', 'Bible', 'have', 'today', 'hands']",N/A
