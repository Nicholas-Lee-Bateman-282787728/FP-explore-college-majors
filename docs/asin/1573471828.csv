They always seem to urke me and loose any kind of 'fun' or 'atmosphere' which was so present in their counterparts from the early 80's through early 90's. I'm sick of zombie movies with no gore and vampire movies being reduced to the same old S#$T about 'Daywalkers' and 'the hunter who passes the book down from generation to generation' and .....BlEH. But this movie is not one of 'those' films.The director actually has talent. He knows how to tell a story! The film doesn't get bogged down in tired genre tidings or wallow in it's under-develped characters, it gets straight down into the zombie fun in the way that good old Lucio would have done back in the day (which isn't surprising because this film basically pays as a giant homage to the great Mr Fulci). The gore is tops, the good old 'make-up' variety instead of this cg crap.If you would put of seeing this film because you don't like other full moon offerings, think again! I don't really like Charles Band's films in particular either, but hey, this film wasn't directed by him.For all of you aspiring film makers out there who are occassionally willing to turn a blind eye to some of the budgetary ristrictions (yes at one point there is some terrible looking superimposed fire), you will find an enjoyable film here. If you have ever made a low budget horror film you will enjoy how true some of the scenes play out, for example, a woman goes to a store to buy some materials for a 'gore' scene and is required to buy packets upon packets of condoms, KY jelly etc. lol- been in the same situations many a time and had many a strange look preping effects on my films!Anyway- good film.

They accidentally bring it back to life as well as open a portal to a dead world that releases dozens of other zombies, then struggle for their lives in a desperate attempt to flee from the creatures who apparently have them hopelessly trapped in the hospital. That's what The Dead Hate the Living is all about.The movie is low-budget zombie movie that was made by Dave Paker and was produced for Full Moon Entertainment. The Dead Hate the Living is one of Full Moon's better efforts, I'll admit, but it took a few viewings to get me to come around to liking it. With a title like The Dead Hate the Living you'd expect some 'serious' zombie mayhem, right? Well, even though they got plenty of zombie mayhem in it, it's anything but serious. I was expecting the movie to be really creepy or scary after watching the trailer for the movie. Turns out to be more of an entertainingly fun zombie movie. It was more in the vein of Evil Dead and Zombieland than Night of the Living Dead or TV's The Walking Dead. No big whoop. I enjoyed it. It's one of the few Full Moon joints I've seen, lately, that I've been satisfied with. Course, this was released way back in 1999/2000..when Full Moon still made good films instead of the cheap T&A-fests; they're putting out now(I'm sorry to feel that way, folks, but I'm really disappointed in how they've seem to not care so much about what they put out now on film).If I had any gripe about this film, it would be that Full Moon should've backed them with a little bigger budget. If they had've, this might've been one of those movies that would have had a cult following, much like Evil Dead or Zombieland. Sadly, they didn't....and we have what we have here.Again, I enjoyed the movie. It's one that I've added to my ever-growing collection of zombie movies.

I came away from this film with an empty, unfulfilled feeling.There are some really cool, great scenes in here.  One of them  is a classic that I think I will always remember.  But unfortunately the  zombies never get too deadly and their leader (Dr. Eibon) never seems to  get 'evil enough'.  What I am trying to say, is that you never are too  sickened, hate, or even get too disgusted with the zombies and Dr. Eibon  (aside from one, possibly 2 scenes) in the film.I really liked the  storyline in this film though.  The opening of a world of zombies is a  great idea!  The ending was so open ended, if reminds me of past Full Moon  favorites like the Puppet Master, and Subspecies series whose first films  weren't the greatest, but films following in the series get really great  and create an excellent storyline.The actors were not really too great,  but you do get an exceptional performance by Jamie Donahue.  Her acting was  believable, and thrilling to watch.  She was the best of the cast and I  hope to see her in more!I am looking forward to any sequels Full Moon  may make.

This one is an old fashioned zombie romp, starting off with the well worn premise of young filmmakers shooting their low budget horror movie in the wrong place at the wrong time. That's because the huge warehouse place they've picked was formerly the home of a long haired mad scientist type desperate to bring the dead back to life. As the movie savvy youngsters find out, he succeeded, as they find themselves up to their armpits in hungry walking corpses. The director of this flick, Dave Parker, was an editor on a lot of Full Moon's trailers, and his direction and editing are his strongest points. His script is not quite as well put together, and acknowledging its own lack of originality with references to other horror movies doesn't make up for it. There's an awful lot left unexplained, and his stylistic touches aren't enough to make the viewer overlook that. Still, the performances aren't bad for the most part, the effects are decent, and the money was probably better spent on this than it would have been another Puppet Master clipathon/sequel.

I'm very proud to welcome The Dead Hate The Living into the ranks of the ""good zombie movies"". It's not in the same batch with Romero or Fulci, but this one helps bridge the gap between the ""greats"" and the ""downright awful"". I think there has long been a big discrepancy between the two extremes with not a lot of movies falling in that mid-range.The movie revolves around a young director, named David Poe (Eric Clawson), making his first feature film, and it just happens to be about zombies. Oh, the irony of it all! Do you think he planned it that way? Of course he did, the character of David is really based on much of the life of director David Parker. David Poe's sisters and friends round up the cast and crew for the film. They've decided to break in to an abandoned hospital to make their film. And we all know what happens to people in horror films who do anything illegal or immoral...they die. Not to give anything away, but I'm sure we all know that by now. It wouldn't have been so bad had they left the corpse they found alone. And we all know what happens when you use a real corpse as an unpaid cast member in your new movie that you're making. Well, okay, so that one's not as obvious maybe, I've tried to tell you guys this, but I'll repeat it again for those who missed it. Don't mess with dead things! Just don't do it, it will save you all a lot of pain and grief.The Dead Hate the Living was a little slow to take off but once it did, it kept the tension till the end. Don't expect to jump out of your seats during the picture, but expect to get some creepy atmosphere. Parker brings us two of the more intimidating and scary zombies you'll ever see.There was copious amounts of gore, but none of it took away from the story, but rather served to compliment it. I think real horror fans will enjoy this movie because it was directed by a guy who really loves the genre and you can tell. Parker pays homage to many of the greats who have come before him, notably the likes of Carpenter, Fulci, Romero, and Raimi. He also pays homage to great make-up artist and actor Tom Savini and the best S-Mart employee of them all, Bruce Campbell. I challenge you to watch this movie, pay attention to the details, and see how many references to other movies you can find.If this movie had a higher budget they could have done a lot more with it and it could have been really amazing!

Well, looks like it worked cuz they got my money for this DVD release.I didn't hate everything about this movie.  The two main zombies are actually quite cool.  (You'll be amazed to learn in the bonus materials that one of the actors playing them actually LOOKS like his character almost!)

But unfortunately this film has absolutely nothing else going for it.  All the other actors in the film are really bad.  And the lines are bad.  And the characters are annoying.  And the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  And the technical aspects are not good enough.  Like many others have said, this film just didn't have enough budget.

They stretch is pretty far, but this just ain't enough for a film that needs built sets and lots of effects and detailed lighting.  The sad part is they probably didn't need all that much more.  The performances are kinda amateurish, but they're still sort of appealing, for the most part.  It's a bit on the talky and slow-moving side, as it's a lot cheaper and faster to shoot people just standing around, talking.  And, when they get around to the zombie carnage, they don't have the fx budget to pull it off very well, and these scenes aren't especially well staged.  This is another self-referential horror-comedy, and not an especially clever one.  Unlike some of these sorts of films, the makers (Dave Parker, in particular) are clearly big fans and know it well, but most of the references are way, way too obvious and on the nose. (Most of the time, they just say some horror icons name, for no particular reason)  There are a few clever moments, and it's sorta endearing overall, but it's still too obvious.I wouldn't necessarily suggest that a serious zombie film fan not see this, but don't be expecting too much.

I guess the premise of some film-makers making a zombie flick in an abandoned asylum/hospital/whatever it was only to find real zombies there seemed sort of neat. MAN was I wrong. I knew I had made a huge error in judgment by renting it when early on, there is a scene where a supposedly 'hot' blonde babe wearing all black or course, goes into a convenience store for supplies. The cashier leers at her while ringing it up, then says, ""that'll be $36.97"" and she simply takes the sack, glares at him, and walks off making some rude comment. He just stares at her. You know what they forgot to include in the scene? See, there's this tradition when you make a purchase where after you find out the total, you **actually give the salesperson currency in exchange for your items**. The guy doesn't remark in any way about her not paying (or make any remark at all), so you know it was just sheer sloppiness on the part of the film-makers. It just got worse from there. The worst make-up effects I've seen in quite some time, and that's saying a lot. There's the stupid ""skull"" makeup on some guy playing an actor portraying a zombie that actually gets less realistic when he turns into a zombie for real. I would like to give a little credit for using air bladders instead of CGI...,but they actually parts of a guy's skeleton stretching like it was made of rubber. Little hint when you use air bladders guys, try to restrict them to parts of the body that actually stretch. One particularly bad effect was fake teeth, supposed to be part of the skull showing through, that actually were visibly glued on top of his upper lip (there was a second set underneath). Please note that I am making the effect sound more realistic than it was. The acting was slightly above average, but with lines like, ""I think we've slipped into some kind of, like, netherworld, man"" what can ya do? The plot seemed like it was being made up as they went along. There were elements that just plain insulted the audience's intelligence, such as a zombie whose main feature was that he visibly lacked any semblance of a nose, sniffing someone to see if they were human. I could predict everything before it happened...

189176,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,1573471828,Martin Asiner,"[9, 13]","Ever since Bela Lugosi began the zombie genre back in the 30s, Hollywood thought of the idea that the dead might walk the earth solely in terms of gothic and serious horror.  The zombies of that era were usually centered in Haiti and were under the mind control of a demented shaman.  It did not occur to anyone that zombies might have a gentler, even humorous side.  Certainly, when George Romero brought out his LIVING DEAD trilogy, the notion that the walking dead must be the height of seriousness was etched in stone.  Yet, in the 80s with the EVIL DEAD series of director Sam Raimi, Hollywood saw an opportunity to inject some much needed life into a moribund genre.  Now, by 2000, director David Parker continues this tremendously amusing, albeit gory, trend with THE DEAD HATE THE LIVING.  The plot can be seen as a humorous version of the 'young kids get their comeuppance' so popular in slasher movies of the 80s.  Other,less understanding critics simply label this film and others of its ilk as unabashed ripoffs of earlier, better known walking dead movies.  The truth is that both approaches have merit.TDHTL is a funny satire on the making of walking dead movies, exactly like this one.  Director Parker uses unknown youthful actors who play actors in a zombie film.  Thus, as in HAMLET, you have a movie-within-a-movie.  But unlike HAMLET, the events of TDHTL present the inner movie as far more interesting than the outer.  A nearly financially broke and probably bereft of talent group of teens are shooting a walking dead movie in a spooky house that is actually a conduit to another dimension from which its walking dead now find ready passage to the world of our dimension.  One of the more subtle ironies is that it takes some real talent to portray actors of no talent.  Eric Clawson and Matt Stephens are convincingly and humorously horrified as the leads. What Director Parker presents is yet another variation on the consequences of attempting to Go Where Man Is Not Supposed to Go.  The results are gory, spectacular, and quite unnerving.  The difference between TDHTL and its more serious ancestors--say ZOMBIE--is that the viewer has nearly as much fun watching the ketchup fly as do the actors tossing that same ketchup around.  The fun is contagious, and this I suggest is what an entertaining movie is supposed to do.",4,"Actually, the Dead Love the Living",1041206400,"12 30, 2002",2002,2348,"['Ever', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'began', 'zombie', 'genre', 'back', '30s', 'Hollywood', 'thought', 'idea', 'dead', 'might', 'walk', 'earth', 'solely', 'terms', 'gothic', 'serious', 'horror', 'zombies', 'era', 'were', 'usually', 'centered', 'Haiti', 'were', 'mind', 'control', 'demented', 'shaman', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'anyone', 'zombies', 'might', 'have', 'gentler', 'even', 'humorous', 'side', 'Certainly', 'when', 'George', 'Romero', 'brought', 'out', 'LIVING', 'DEAD', 'trilogy', 'notion', 'walking', 'dead', 'must', 'be', 'height', 'seriousness', 'was', 'etched', 'stone', '80s', 'EVIL', 'DEAD', 'series', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Hollywood', 'saw', 'opportunity', 'inject', 'much', 'needed', 'life', 'moribund', 'genre', 'Now', '2000', 'director', 'David', 'Parker', 'tremendously', 'amusing', 'albeit', 'gory', 'trend', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'HATE', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'humorous', 'version', ""'young"", 'kids', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'so', 'popular', 'slasher', 'movies', '80s', 'Other', 'less', 'understanding', 'critics', 'simply', 'label', 'film', 'others', 'ilk', 'unabashed', 'ripoffs', 'earlier', 'better', 'known', 'walking', 'dead', 'movies', 'truth', 'approaches', 'have', 'merit.TDHTL', 'funny', 'satire', 'making', 'walking', 'dead', 'movies', 'exactly', 'one', 'Director', 'Parker', 'unknown', 'youthful', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'actors', 'zombie', 'film', 'Thus', 'HAMLET', 'have', 'movie-within-a-movie', 'HAMLET', 'events', 'TDHTL', 'present', 'inner', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'outer', 'nearly', 'financially', 'broke', 'probably', 'bereft', 'talent', 'group', 'teens', 'are', 'shooting', 'walking', 'dead', 'movie', 'spooky', 'house', 'actually', 'conduit', 'dimension', 'walking', 'dead', 'now', 'find', 'ready', 'passage', 'world', 'dimension', 'One', 'more', 'subtle', 'ironies', 'real', 'talent', 'portray', 'actors', 'talent', 'Eric', 'Clawson', 'Matt', 'Stephens', 'are', 'convincingly', 'humorously', 'horrified', 'leads', 'What', 'Director', 'Parker', 'yet', 'variation', 'consequences', 'attempting', 'Go', 'Where', 'Man', 'Not', 'Supposed', 'Go', 'results', 'are', 'gory', 'spectacular', 'quite', 'unnerving', 'difference', 'TDHTL', 'more', 'serious', 'ancestors', 'say', 'ZOMBIE', 'viewer', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'watching', 'ketchup', 'fly', 'do', 'actors', 'tossing', 'same', 'ketchup', 'fun', 'contagious', 'suggest', 'what', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'supposed', 'do']",N/A

We can remember placing this one in the ""guaranteed to be here or it's free"" section along with An Evening With Dice and Lock-Up causing much head turning laughter. We're talking 1999 here which was smack dab in the middle of all those golden years of youthful living. This was pretty much the tail end of when Full Moon was still attempting to make somewhat legitimate flicks...in fact this may have been the last one.The plot is simple and effective; A crew is filming a no budget horror is some run down warehouse they illegally broke into to shoot the movie. It actually has to be a true story from Full Moon's past. Anyway, they brake in and start filming a zombie movie when they summon the dead from deep within the basement causing actually zombies to come to life. Instead of shooting the B they just wind up acting in it. Most everyone gets taken out by the walking dead except for the main director and some blond chick. They wind up going through the door that the dead came in through transporting themselves into another dimension. If you were ripped it probably would have made a lot more sense.In typical B fashion they film has nothing to offer to the ordinary person. However for the B enthusiast this one was worth the one time watch and had to be done out of respect for the Full Moon franchise. After watching this it made Sid wonder why we never made any movies when clearly you don't need any money. We probably could have made a mint just filming ourselves messing with Santa while he snored away in his knock off lazy boy chair, while dumping massive amounts of sweat into his title towel.

189188,A22PVOH7W4QTYM,1573471828,V. Dawn,"[3, 3]","Being a Full Moon Movie, I was alittle skeptic about getting it as first. Although, I had seen Puppetmaster, and loved it, they don't exactly put out the best movies, in my opinion. But being a zombie movie fan, I knew I had to see it. I'm glad I did...Starting out alittle slow, the movie follows a group of friends filming a horror movie in an old hospital late at night, that they're not exactly supposed to be in. About 40 minutes into the movie, one of them ventures into the basement of the hospital, and finds an odd looking coffin. Upon opening the coffin they find a dead body (who by the way, resembles Rob Zombie abit), and decide to use it in their movie. During the filming, they unknowingly bring him back to life along with the rest of the dead. The hospital is soon overrun with zombies and one by one they become victims and come back as the walking dead themselves...there's a few fresh ideas in this film that sets it apart from other zombie movies.There's a pretty good amount of blood in the film, and for a low budget movie the acting isn't all that bad. Although it starts out slow, it's not boring, the atmosphere is relatively creepy and most of the characters are likable. The make up and effects are also very realistic looking, with the expection of the ""Zombie Barbeque"" scene with the fire. Overall, it's a creepy zombie flick worth checking out.",4,Pretty Good Zombie Horror,1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,1376,"['Being', 'Full', 'Moon', 'Movie', 'was', 'alittle', 'skeptic', 'getting', 'first', 'had', 'seen', 'Puppetmaster', 'loved', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'put', 'out', 'best', 'movies', 'opinion', 'being', 'zombie', 'movie', 'fan', 'knew', 'had', 'see', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Starting', 'out', 'alittle', 'slow', 'movie', 'group', 'friends', 'filming', 'horror', 'movie', 'old', 'hospital', 'late', 'night', ""'re"", 'not', 'exactly', 'supposed', 'be', '40', 'minutes', 'movie', 'one', 'ventures', 'basement', 'hospital', 'odd', 'looking', 'coffin', 'opening', 'coffin', 'find', 'dead', 'body', 'who', 'way', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'abit', 'decide', 'use', 'movie', 'filming', 'unknowingly', 'bring', 'back', 'life', 'rest', 'dead', 'hospital', 'soon', 'overrun', 'zombies', 'one', 'one', 'become', 'victims', 'come', 'back', 'walking', 'dead', 'few', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'film', 'apart', 'other', 'zombie', 'pretty', 'good', 'amount', 'blood', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'out', 'slow', 'not', 'boring', 'atmosphere', 'relatively', 'creepy', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'make', 'up', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'realistic', 'looking', 'expection', 'Zombie', 'Barbeque', 'scene', 'fire', 'Overall', 'creepy', 'zombie', 'flick', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A
189189,A3VROBXAJDF6MA,1573471828,"""vincentarlock""","[3, 3]","If you are a horror movie buff you'll enjoy this, as they're are clever references to Fulci and other classic gore films. The interviews at the end of the movie pretty much say it all...they(director, writer, etc.) are horror fans and wanted to do a movie that was reminiscent of the old Italian masterpieces. The plot is better than average (at least it tries to be creative) as it goes that a group of students are trying to film a horror movie in an abandoned hospital but end of opening a portal to an alternate world of the dead though, as they soon discover, they did more than just open the doorway.  As expected, the rest of the movie is the film students trying to escape a gory death. The actors themselves are amusing and give the film a corny, evil dead type feel. Had they tried to be serious... the film just wouldn't have worked. Storyline and characters have been covered and now for the all important factor: gore. The opening sequence is a mixture of gore and eroticism (little bit of undead love) that starts the flick off on the creative right foot.  I'd explain it but that would take away from your experience if you ever choose to watch this movie.  After that things build up for some time and then, once they open the doorway, there is some more zombie action. A good scene that comes to mind is when one of the students gets a zombie arm punched through his stomach and then his limp corpse is dragged down the hall by his intestines. Quite colorful! Overall the movie, though possessing some plot holes and the occassional bad effect, is one of the better zombie efforts to come out in recent years.  Definitely worth your time if you enjoy this genre.",3,Not Scary But a Fun Zombie Flick,999302400,"09 1, 2001",2001,1679,"['are', 'horror', 'movie', 'buff', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', ""'re"", 'are', 'clever', 'references', 'Fulci', 'other', 'classic', 'gore', 'films', 'interviews', 'end', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'say', 'director', 'writer', 'etc', 'are', 'horror', 'fans', 'wanted', 'do', 'movie', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'old', 'Italian', 'masterpieces', 'plot', 'better', 'average', 'least', 'be', 'creative', 'group', 'students', 'are', 'trying', 'film', 'horror', 'movie', 'abandoned', 'hospital', 'end', 'opening', 'portal', 'alternate', 'world', 'dead', 'though', 'soon', 'discover', 'did', 'more', 'just', 'open', 'doorway', 'expected', 'rest', 'movie', 'film', 'students', 'trying', 'escape', 'gory', 'death', 'actors', 'are', 'amusing', 'give', 'film', 'corny', 'evil', 'dead', 'type', 'feel', 'Had', 'tried', 'be', 'serious', 'film', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'Storyline', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'covered', 'now', 'important', 'factor', 'gore', 'opening', 'sequence', 'mixture', 'gore', 'eroticism', 'little', 'bit', 'undead', 'love', 'flick', 'off', 'creative', 'right', 'foot', ""'d"", 'explain', 'would', 'take', 'away', 'experience', 'ever', 'choose', 'watch', 'movie', 'things', 'build', 'up', 'time', 'then', 'once', 'open', 'doorway', 'more', 'zombie', 'action', 'good', 'scene', 'mind', 'when', 'one', 'students', 'zombie', 'arm', 'punched', 'stomach', 'then', 'limp', 'corpse', 'dragged', 'hall', 'intestines', 'Quite', 'colorful', 'movie', 'possessing', 'plot', 'holes', 'occassional', 'bad', 'effect', 'one', 'better', 'zombie', 'efforts', 'come', 'out', 'recent', 'years', 'Definitely', 'time', 'enjoy', 'genre']",N/A
