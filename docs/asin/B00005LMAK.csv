663631,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00005LMAK,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[1, 1]","Thsi movie is based on a comic book of the same name.  It's probably one of the most graphic comic books I have ever read, in that it has copious amounts of sex and violence inherent in its' storylines.  Having read the comic, I was suprised to find that someone had adapted it into a movie, or, atleast tried.  Seeing that it was directed by Brian Yuzna, who produced such movies as Re-Animator, From Beyond, and Return of the Living Dead 3, I thought it might be pretty good.  Now I knew they probably would be able to incorporate the amount of sex and violence into this movie to be true to the comic, so I tried to keep an open mind going into this movie.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  The story involves a man who sells his soul in order to gain demonic powers in order to dispatch the criminals that have taken his life away from him, namely by killing his wife.  The price he pays ends up being more than he thought, as the demon M, who gave him his powers in exchange for his soul, has other plans for him.  This does come off a little like Todd McFarlanes Spawn, but not as slick graphically but unlike Spawn it did have nudity and some sexual situations.  There were flaws in continuity and the acting was pretty bad at times, but I ended up just going with the flow.  I was a little disappointed with some of the scenes where Faust was dispatching bad guys using his razor claws as they didn't seem as graphic as they should have been.  When you slice someone throat or guts open with 12 inch razor claws, you expect a lot more blood than was shown.  Some of those effects looked really cheap and could have been done better.  Some of the effects were done pretty well.  There is some CGI involved, but I think there was more use of prosthetics which looked a little phoney at times but overall not bad.  Hardcore fans of the comic may be disappointed in the shortcomings of the film, but I did feel that they tried to do the best the could with what they had.  I felt the title role was miscast with Mark Frost, but that's my opinion.  I think a different lead actor and bigger production budget would have made a big difference.",3,Everything has a price...,1057622400,"07 8, 2003",2003,2156,"['Thsi', 'movie', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'graphic', 'comic', 'books', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'copious', 'amounts', 'sex', 'violence', 'inherent', 'storylines', 'Having', 'read', 'comic', 'was', 'suprised', 'find', 'someone', 'had', 'adapted', 'movie', 'atleast', 'tried', 'Seeing', 'was', 'directed', 'Brian', 'Yuzna', 'who', 'produced', 'such', 'movies', 'Re-Animator', 'From', 'Beyond', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', '3', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'Now', 'knew', 'probably', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'incorporate', 'amount', 'sex', 'violence', 'movie', 'be', 'true', 'comic', 'so', 'tried', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'going', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'either', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'soul', 'order', 'gain', 'demonic', 'powers', 'order', 'dispatch', 'criminals', 'have', 'taken', 'life', 'away', 'namely', 'killing', 'wife', 'price', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'thought', 'demon', 'M', 'who', 'gave', 'powers', 'exchange', 'soul', 'other', 'plans', 'come', 'off', 'little', 'Todd', 'McFarlanes', 'Spawn', 'not', 'slick', 'graphically', 'Spawn', 'did', 'have', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'situations', 'were', 'flaws', 'continuity', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'times', 'ended', 'up', 'just', 'going', 'flow', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'scenes', 'where', 'Faust', 'was', 'dispatching', 'bad', 'guys', 'using', 'razor', 'claws', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'graphic', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'When', 'slice', 'someone', 'throat', 'guts', 'open', '12', 'inch', 'razor', 'claws', 'expect', 'lot', 'more', 'blood', 'was', 'shown', 'effects', 'looked', 'really', 'cheap', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'pretty', 'well', 'CGI', 'involved', 'think', 'was', 'more', 'use', 'prosthetics', 'looked', 'little', 'phoney', 'times', 'overall', 'not', 'bad', 'Hardcore', 'fans', 'comic', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'did', 'feel', 'tried', 'do', 'best', 'could', 'what', 'had', 'felt', 'title', 'role', 'was', 'miscast', 'Mark', 'Frost', 'opinion', 'think', 'different', 'lead', 'actor', 'bigger', 'production', 'budget', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'big', 'difference']",Faust

I'm not familiar with the comic book this horror flick is based on and it may hold some appeal to fans of that series, but any normal horror film viewer will surely find this excruciating to sit through.I have read that the R-rated cut is the only version available on US video/DVD and surely this doesn't help matters.  I saw the film on premium cable TV (where it 'premiered at 3am - if that's any clue) and it was listed as ""UNRATED"", but from watching it, it was clearly the edited R print.  Every gore scene was edited so quickly that it was almost impossible to figure out what was going on half the time.  Not that you really care, anyway.  Scenes are cleary edited down eliminating obviously over-the-top gore that you can tell must have once been there.  And if a movie really stinks - and this one does - at least some wild unedited gore efx would make it easier to sit through.  But the R version is just lacking all the way around.The film looks cheap (you can just 'feel' the film crew working right out of camera range).  The actors all try to ham it up and fail miserably.  Jeffrey Combs is slumming it again playing the same crazed character he always does.  The ""Wishmaster"" guy is here sans makeup - he needs some, trust me.  The female lead is as dull as dirt with that stupid phony accent trying to make it seem like she's intelligent.  And then there's all those stupid monster-slime effects - man are they bad - they so much scream ***80's***!!!!  Yep, I believe they were done  by Screaming Mad George and they look just as rubbery and fake as they did 15 years ago.  And don't even get me started on the demon Faust character's superhero (???) suit.  Hahahaha!  Boy...it's hard to believe this got made in the 21st century.I usually find Yuzna's films to be quite entertaining and some of them actually quite excellent....but FAUST is disastrous.

663641,AXLW246TETRY1,B00005LMAK,Lunchbox,"[0, 2]","&quot;Faust: Love of the Damned&quot; was a total rip-off of &quot;Spawn&quot;. It has the exact same storyline...But it's still funny to see that this flick is gorier than the Mark Dipp&eacute;'s realistic version of &quot;Spawn&quot;, which used to be an ultra-violent comic book series. To me, &quot;Faust: Love of The Damned&quot; was a revenge. It was everything I wanted to see in &quot;Spawn&quot; a couple of years ago. I admit that I am not at all a fan of comic books,I'd even say I find most of them stupid, but I always had a better feeling about &quot;Spawn&quot;, because of its values, the hero, and especially the fact that the hero is a very violent character that has to learn how to control his hatred, the violence he keeps inside...Anyways, I always thought that Spawn didn't limit himself at kicking the bad guys' butts and knocking them to the floor, he got straight to the point; he kills them. And he doesn't say a bunch of cheesy lines after he has killed someone, and he doesn't beat up a bad guy and save him before he falls down a building, to show his good intentions, his lust for justice.Actually, you may believe that what I'm saying is besides the point. It is not. Because, like I said before, &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;Spawn&quot; are pretty much the same thing. It also has elements taken from &quot;The Crow&quot;, (Spoilers) like the hero's girlfriend that is raped and killed by a bunch of felons. First, there is absolutely no explanation of why they killed her. Anyways, it's not that important, even though that's the reason why John Jaspers (Faust) signs a pact with a mysterious man (played by Andrew Divoff). Anyways, I won't tell you the whole storyline because, first, it is bad (it has less elements and details that &quot;Spawn&quot;'s or &quot;The Crow&quot;'s, but I am NOT saying that the storylines of these movies are BAD), and second, see both of the movies I just mentionned, and you'll have exactly the same thing, with more richness and explanations.&quot;Faust&quot; may be an absolute copy of two better movies, but that's not where the main interest is, and I'm not saying this only from a personnal view. It's all about the gore. And Faust, in one scene, after having killed a dozen of bandits (and he kills them in very gruesome ways, with many graphic mutilations and lots of blood) simply looks at the camera, like he is talking to the viewer, and says: &quot;Too much blood, or not enough?&quot;...That's the moment where I caught the whole point. And that particular quote made me stop the movie, and think for a while...I looked at the box, and I saw &quot;Directed by Brian Yuzna&quot;...I had my explanation.Yuzna directed a handful of pretty bloody movies, and usually doesn't deliver a very impressive scenario, but focuses on the gore aspect. That's okay, but it seemed like he tried to make something with values, something with a certain philosophy. That's not a bad idea, but he took someone else's ideas. So, I guess he'll have to keep on making stupid gory movies. It's his style, and really, today, that's original, because REAL gore movies are rare these days. And believe me, &quot;Faust: Love of The Damned&quot; is filled with gore, from the beginning to the end. I could easily say it's one of the goriest films of the last five or six years. It really has scenes of dismemberment, mutilations, and more. And what about the shotgun hits...they were nice...It's in a scene where a woman armed with a shotgun stands in front of two men and shoots one in the torso. The guy flies away and there's lots of blood. but then comes another pretty violent act; the woman shoots a guy that is lying on the floor point blank with the shotgun. The head simply explodes. There's also a weird scene involving Andrew Divoff and the woman, where he seems to give her a huge orgasm by simply looking at her, but she then mutates into some kind of worm. I just didn't get the point of that scene.The special effects techniques are very nice, they don't use any computers and the gore is really effective. Faust's costume looks somehow goofy, with the very fake thorns, and the &quot;X-men&quot;'s Wolverine aspect. Plus, I'd say that the actor himself makes the hero look inoffensive. He's not a very good actor. And his voice, his face, and his text couldn't really make us believe that he's a powerful superhero. He proves it, though, in many violent sequences where he wastes dozens of people.The imagery is varied,and sometimes pretty nice, and there's a certain mood in the film, but the weakness of the character development ruins it all. Anyways, for fans of Yuzna, this should be your treat, but for fans of good movies, and for people who don't have the slightest interest in gore, this is pure trash. But, if you are interested in gore cinema, this film is, I think, one of the greater models of what gore should still be. In the gore aspect, this is very close to old school gore movies. It's a survivor, and a strong one, in the level of gore and in the quality of the effects. This really is a violent film, it's really as violent as Hong Kong's mangas or very bloody Comic Books.Finally, I can say that this is a joy to see that gore remains present in the world of films, that it's not completely dead, but so rare are the films of that genre these days, that we have to be happy with movies such as this one. Compare it that way: If you're in a desert, and you're really thirsty, and suddenly, you see an oasis where the water tastes real bad, you'll still drink, and try to forget the taste. It's exactly the same thing with us, the gore fans, that are suffering from the nostalgia of what we miss today. We are ready to swallow anything that has very nice gore, even if the scenario plain sucks. Sorry.But, overall...as a film....this is bad...really...",2,Another survivor,1065484800,"10 7, 2003",2003,5840,"['quot', 'Faust', 'Love', 'Damned', 'quot', 'was', 'total', 'rip-off', 'quot', 'Spawn',

663642,ACBA805501SEU,B00005LMAK,Matthew Skidmore,"[0, 0]","Let me begin by saying that I am a big Brian Yuzna fan. Since he (and Stuart Gordon) exploded onto the screens in the 80s with RE-ANIMATOR I have been hooked. It's also been great to see that they have both consistently worked in the horror and fantasy genre ever since, cranking out gems like SOCIETY, CASTLE FREAK and THE BEYOND. This now brings me to FAUST. I have been looking forward to this first release from Yuzna's new spanish film studio for a long time. Then I got to see it . . . the film is very weird. It has a strong spanish feel to it (obviously), but it also tries to pander to the US market (also quite obvious). But, this is where the movie ultimately fails. By trying too hard to be american, the entire movie comes across very fake and awkward.The problems come very early on. Lead actor Mark Frost is drastically underwritten and therefore displays the emotional range of a paper cup. His eternal grimacing face reminds me of Beaker from THE MUPPETS. The always excellent Jeffrey Combs seems uncomfortable in his miscast role of the tough inner-city cop. (See him shine in THE FRIGHTENERS and the pointless I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER). Andrew Divoff excels (as always) but his character too seems underwritten to the point that when he comes on screen I almost forgot why he was actually in the film. Oh yeah, he's the villain . . . The female members of the film are very good. Isabelle Brook is a strong performer and holds the emotional arm of the film really well. The deliciously villainous Monica Van Campen camps it up in a major way to steal all of her (very brief) scenes. Screaming Mad Georges' effects work is yet again imaginative and strange, and cinematographer Jacques Haitkin gives the movie a vibrant and exotic look. Comic-book writer Tim Vigils' script is littered with cliche and none of the dramatic horror that the comic book itself had. When Frost turns into the clawed creature of the title, he comes across as a second rate villain from the 60s BATMAN TV show, and not a hardcore horror icon that was present in the Rebel Studios original comic.The disc itself is good. There are two commentary tracks (one by Yuzna - informative and interesting) and one by Mad George, Divoff and Haitkin - okay, Divoff has a great voice). The picture quality is sharp and the soundtrack is good. All in all, the movie is okay - not one of Yuzna's best efforts, but whatever he makes it is certainly a lot more exciting than a lot of horror movies out there. One thing puzzles me about this LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT disc though, is that it doesn't seem to have an MPAA rating. Can anyone tell me if this is the unrated version? Or is it the R? It's just that I heard the unrated version was very extreme and had to be cut, and this doesn't seem all that gory a movie. Anyway, onto the next. Maybe Yuzna's next movie BEYOND RE-ANIMATOR will deliver the undead goods, and give Jeffrey Combs another chance to bring out his best role . .",3,Im damned if I know what to make of this . . .,1004313600,"10 29, 2001",2001,2976,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'am', 'big', 'Brian', 'Yuzna', 'fan', 'Stuart', 'Gordon', 'exploded', 'screens', '80s', 'RE-ANIMATOR', 'have', 'been', 'hooked', 'also', 'been', 'great', 'see', 'have', 'consistently', 'worked', 'horror', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'ever', 'cranking', 'out', 'gems', 'SOCIETY', 'CASTLE', 'FREAK', 'THE', 'BEYOND', 'now', 'FAUST', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'first', 'release', 'Yuzna', 'new', 'spanish', 'film', 'studio', 'long', 'time', 'Then', 'got', 'see', 'film', 'very', 'weird', 'strong', 'spanish', 'feel', 'obviously', 'also', 'pander', 'US', 'market', 'also', 'quite', 'obvious', 'where', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'american', 'entire', 'movie', 'very', 'fake', 'awkward.The', 'problems', 'come', 'very', 'early', 'Lead', 'actor', 'Mark', 'Frost', 'drastically', 'underwritten', 'therefore', 'emotional', 'range', 'paper', 'cup', 'eternal', 'grimacing', 'face', 'Beaker', 'THE', 'MUPPETS', 'always', 'excellent', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'uncomfortable', 'miscast', 'role', 'tough', 'inner-city', 'cop', 'See', 'shine', 'THE', 'FRIGHTENERS', 'pointless', 'STILL', 'KNOW', 'WHAT', 'YOU', 'DID', 'LAST', 'SUMMER', 'Andrew', 'Divoff', 'excels', 'always', 'character', 'too', 'underwritten', 'point', 'when', 'screen', 'almost', 'forgot', 'why', 'was', 'actually', 'film', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'villain', 'female', 'members', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Isabelle', 'Brook', 'strong', 'performer', 'emotional', 'arm', 'film', 'really', 'well', 'deliciously', 'villainous', 'Monica', 'Van', 'Campen', 'camps', 'up', 'major', 'way', 'steal', 'very', 'brief', 'scenes', 'Screaming', 'Mad', 'Georges', 'effects', 'work', 'yet', 'again', 'imaginative', 'strange', 'cinematographer', 'Jacques', 'Haitkin', 'movie', 'vibrant', 'exotic', 'look', 'Comic-book', 'writer', 'Tim', 'Vigils', 'script', 'littered', 'cliche', 'none', 'dramatic', 'horror', 'comic', 'book', 'had', 'When', 'Frost', 'clawed', 'creature', 'title', 'across', 'second', 'rate', 'villain', '60s', 'BATMAN', 'TV', 'show', 'not', 'hardcore', 'horror', 'icon', 'was', 'present', 'Rebel', 'Studios', 'original', 'comic.The', 'disc', 'good', 'are', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'one', 'Yuzna', 'informative', 'interesting', 'one', 'Mad', 'George', 'Divoff', 'Haitkin', 'okay', 'Divoff', 'great', 'voice', 'picture', 'quality', 'sharp', 'soundtrack', 'good', 'movie', 'okay', 'not', 'one', 'Yuzna', 'best', 'efforts', 'certainly', 'lot', 'more', 'exciting', 'lot', 'horror', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'One', 'thing', 'LIONS', 'GATE', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'disc', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'MPAA', 'rating', 'Can', 'anyone', 'tell', 'unrated', 'version', 'R', 'just', 'heard', 'unrated', 'version', 'was', 'very', 'extreme', 'had', 'be', 'cut', ""n't"", 'seem', 'gory', 'movie', 'Anyway', 'next', 'Maybe', 'Yuzna', 'next', 'movie', 'BEYOND', 'RE-ANIMATOR', 'will', 'deliver', 'undead', 'goods', 'give', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'chance', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'role']",Faust

Going to new extremes in terms of violence and sex, any new ground broken by Faust would be overshadowed by Todd MacFarlane's Spawn years later, which basically has the same premise.  In either event, frequent Stuart Gordon partner Brian Yuzna, who has directed Re-Animator sequels as well as the excellent Return of the Living Dead 3, helms this adaptation of Faust, and as you can guess by reading the various reviews, the results are disastrous.  I don't mind cheesy or low budget horror flicks one bit, but Faust stinks to high heaven with it's mostly lame effects and ridiculous costume.  Mark Frost stars as a revenge driven artist seeking vengeance for the death of his girlfriend.  This leads to a deal with a demon named M (the Wishmaster himself, Andrew Divoff), and soon enough he's transformed into a bloodthirsty creature with Wolverine-esque claws and an insane temperment.  The acting is beyond horrible, especially Frost as the whiny main character.  The only time we get a respite is from the brief appearances from Jeffrey ""Re-Animator"" Combs, but even his talents can't save this waste.

I've seen a number of bad Brian Yuzna flicks over the years; this one would vie with The Dentist as my favorite of his directorial efforts.Plot: John Jaspers (Mark Frost, recently of the TV series Hope Springs) gets picked up and thrown into the loony bin, raving about people out to get him, where he meets psychologist Jade de Camp (Alone's Isabel Brook) and tries to convince her of the danger he's in. No go, unfortunately, and John is summarily dispatched by those very folks who were, in fact, out to get him. M (The Dead Matter's Andrew Divoff) mentions, as they're offing him, that maybe they'll go find that cute doctor. As so often happens in movies like this, Jaspers then decides to deal with a higher authority in order to get revenge (viz. Spawn, The Dead One, The Crow, etc.). Once he's back on the street, well, he starts getting it, while trying to conceal his recently-deceased condition from Jade, who's starting to fall for him, as well.Yes, it's over the top, but Yuzna's over-the-top style does make for good comic-book mayhem, just as Burton's did in the original Batman film from the eighties. And yeah, Yuzna didn't grab A-listers for this one, but again, let me remind you what happened when Jim Carrey and Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared in Batman-franchise films. It's enough to make you flee screaming to the scale department. (Need I bring up the spectre of Catwoman?) And to be fair, no one here is really a bad actor; Frost comes off as a slightly upscale Thomas Jane, Divoff is his usual scenery-chewing self, and Brook is fine when she's not killing her career by appearing in dreck like About a Boy. Some decent special effects, a few cheesy action scenes, and of course that one scene that seems to be de rigeur in comic-book films where all the bad guys are sitting around a table discussing being bad. (The Crow, Blade, etc.) I think that, while it's not a world-beater or anything, it's taken way too much flack for simply being what it is: a dumb, fun movie where [censored for Amazon consumption] blows up a lot. **",3,Not nearly as bad as you've been led to believe.,1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,2684,"['Faust', 'Love', 'Damned', 'Brian', 'Yuzna', '2000', 'words', 'directed', 'Brian', 'Yuzna', 'film', 'are', 'even', 'scarier', 'words', 'produced', 'Brian', 'Yuzna', 'q.v', 'Nun', 'elsewhere', 'ish', 'Worse', 'had', 'idea', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'was', 'graphic', 'novel', 'adaptation', 'released', 'time', 'when', 'phrase', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'was', 'defined', 'unwatchable', 'Batman', 'sequels', 'featuring', 'such', 'master', 'thespians', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'then', 'thought', 'myself', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'worse', 'Batman', 'Forever', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'convey', 'idea', 'Sin', 'City', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'right', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'number', 'bad', 'Brian', 'Yuzna', 'years', 'one', 'would', 'vie', 'Dentist', 'favorite', 'directorial', 'efforts.Plot', 'John', 'Jaspers', 'Mark', 'Frost', 'recently', 'TV', 'series', 'Hope', 'Springs', 'picked', 'up', 'thrown', 'loony', 'bin', 'raving', 'people', 'out', 'get', 'where', 'psychologist', 'Jade', 'de', 'Camp', 'Alone', 'Isabel', 'Brook', 'convince', 'danger', 'go', 'unfortunately', 'John', 'summarily', 'dispatched', 'very', 'folks', 'who', 'were', 'fact', 'get', 'M', 'Dead', 'Matter', 'Andrew', 'Divoff', 'mentions', ""'re"", 'offing', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'go', 'find', 'cute', 'doctor', 'so', 'often', 'movies', 'Jaspers', 'then', 'deal', 'higher', 'authority', 'order', 'get', 'revenge', 'viz', 'Spawn', 'Dead', 'One', 'Crow', 'etc.', 'back', 'street', 'well', 'getting', 'trying', 'conceal', 'recently-deceased', 'condition', 'Jade', 'who', 'starting', 'fall', 'well.Yes', 'top', 'Yuzna', 'over-the-top', 'style', 'make', 'good', 'comic-book', 'mayhem', 'just', 'Burton', 'did', 'original', 'Batman', 'film', 'eighties', 'yeah', 'Yuzna', 'did', ""n't"", 'grab', 'A-listers', 'one', 'again', 'let', 'remind', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'appeared', 'Batman-franchise', 'films', 'enough', 'make', 'flee', 'screaming', 'scale', 'department', 'Need', 'bring', 'up', 'spectre', 'Catwoman', 'be', 'fair', 'one', 'here', 'really', 'bad', 'actor', 'Frost', 'off', 'slightly', 'upscale', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Divoff', 'usual', 'scenery-chewing', 'self', 'Brook', 'fine', 'when', 'not', 'killing', 'career', 'appearing', 'dreck', 'Boy', 'decent', 'special', 'effects', 'few', 'cheesy', 'action', 'scenes', 'course', 'one', 'scene', 'be', 'de', 'rigeur', 'comic-book', 'films', 'where', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'sitting', 'table', 'discussing', 'being', 'bad', 'Crow', 'Blade', 'etc', 'think', 'not', 'world-beater', 'anything', 'taken', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'flack', 'simply', 'being', 'what', 'dumb', 'fun', 'movie', 'where', '[', 'censored', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', 'up', 'lot', '**']",Faust
663649,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B00005LMAK,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[1, 1]","Brian Yuzna decided to take on the rather saucy Quinn/Vigil comic, and from what you'll read in many reviews(not just Amazon), he did not succeed.  Alot of people have said that this is the absolute worst film they've ever seen.  Well, that's pushing it a tad.  Obviously these folks haven't seen anything by Michael Bay.  Anyhow, this was kind of a damned(no pun intended) project from the getgo considering the source.  If you haven't read it, let me assure you that it's extreme.  In order to make it 100% accurate it would have to be a big budget porno flick, and since it has a story with depth, it would probably make a lousy porno flick.  Quinn is actually on board as the screenwriter, so it does try it's best to cram 15 or so comics into 100 minutes.  Basically what we got is an artist hell bent on revenge after the murder of his girlfriend.  He signs a contract with a demon(Andrew Divoff back in his Wishmaster personna) and gains super powers and some nifty bracelets which have Wolverine-like claws.  The downside is that he has an uncontrollable rage, a bad costume and unquenchable bloodlust.  He's also bound to serve Andrew Divoff.  Given hope(which he's not supposed to have) from a psychologist, he goes rogue and attempts to destroy Divoff.  Good points?  Divoff, though a bit typecast, does a very good job and is given quite a bit of screen time.  The movie's got enough cheesiness, sex and gore to satisfy any B-movie lover.  The always lovable Jeffery Combs is in it, though his role is kind of a throwaway.  Bad points?  Depends on who you ask.  The stuff people hate about this movie are what make it enjoyable for me, coz I happen to like this sort of thing.  I wasn't too crazy on this Mark Frost guy who played Faust.  When he's not in costume, he's usually just a whiney wuss.  And I don't quite see how the psychologist falls in love with the guy an hour after meeting him when all he's done in her presence is act crazy and slaughter police officers.  Alot of people call this a ripoff of Spawn, and I guess I can see where they get that considering this comic wasn't very big or as popular as Spawn.  If memory serves though, I believe Faust came out either before or right around the same time as Spawn.  Early nineties, I know for sure.  I'll tell you one thing, Daddy-O, this movie has the violence that the Spawn movie shoulda had.  Should you watch this movie?  If you like The Dentist, yes.

We were introduced to John Jasper, whose girlfriend had been murdered while he watched, as he contemplated his eventual demise above a rushing river. Enter ""the mysterious M,"" a demon of supposed caliber (that later proves he is, at least, funny in a molten flesh kinda way), who offers John a way to avenge his lover's death. Well, Jasper accepts, is given some wolverinesque claws that he carves some people up with, is arrested by the fan-beloved Jeffrey Combs, and is subsequently put in a wittle padded room with a doctor that wants to musically restore his sanity.Had the movie ended here, in the first few minutes, I would have been happy. It didn't, however, much to my dismay.Without giving away anything about the loosely conceived plotline, a defect I can deal with, or some really bad (with the exception of J. Combs) acting, another flaw I can stomach, I will comment on the one reason F.L.O.T.D. found itself in the cutting room dumpster with every other movie that forgot that one small monster/demon movie rule. Always, no matter how creepy your storyline, how hideous your monstrous finale, or how paltry your budget, remember to invest a something in your main demonically enhanced character that allows him to at least look presentable. A foam suit portrayal of muscles, some posable claws, and a few red eye shots really did make me laugh at first, but the laughter ended after a while and the need for fast-forwarding the action sequences began. When demons are beheading people, you really shouldn't even have that type of reaction.Were it not for Combs (an actor I regard and vote for with much bias), the sheer wickedness of our demonic bargain-giver, and the monstrous ending of the movie, I would have sold my soul for a narcoleptic relapse just to escape the torment.

In addition, Isabel Brook ( Jane) has great legs, and we get to see them a lot.Aside from these two points, I left the credits feeling very disappointed.
