At any rate, this movie reminds me a lot of those tacky scifi films from the fifties.

The reason it's worth three stars is the monster. Ignoring the recent craze of CGI, the crew created a full-body suit for the actor playing the creature -- and the hard work certainly payed off. The costume is very realistic and keeps the viewer interested. But, sadly, that's all there is to this movie. The only reason you should rent ""Creature Unknown"" is if you're a monster fan who enjoys the simple pleasure of seeing a murderous creature rip apart naive teenagers (including decapitations and gut-slashing).

820725,A2C5VCR3DYDPR2,B00020X8F2,Some Guy,"[1, 1]","I must come out and defend this movie for one simple reason - the monster.  In this age of CGI, it's quite refreshing to see a very high quality monster suit worn by an actor.  CGI has gotten so good in big budget movies that it's indistinguishable from reality, but lower budget movies that can't afford the real good stuff always have bad CGI.  You instantly know it isn't really there.  Bless Creature Unknown for making the effort to create an old-school rubber suit that looks absolutely great (no wrinkles, bending fingers, or blatant seams), and is really *there*.  For creature fans, you can't beat it, and you get to see a LOT of it.  Even quite a bit in broad daylight.  There's nothing to hide on this suit.  Bravo for the monster!The rest is, of course, completely forgettable.  There was a little more of an attempt at character building than you usually get with popcorn B movie horror, but the plot is nothing new in any way.  As other reviewers have said, there's also the ridiculous.  First is the biker chick genetic engineer with a lab out in woods.  What is the bunker-like underground building she's using?  How did she get it?  How does she afford supplies?There are also many moments of ""well...well...HELLO!"" such as when the main protagonist tells the biker chick scientist that she's holding his father's (or maybe grandfather's, I forget) shotgun.  And...that's it.  He doesn't insist on having it back, doesn't ask how she got it, doesn't make any accusation of her robbing from the cabin.  One character is attacked in what should clearly be a fatal scene, then later he turns up with just a bad stomach-scratching.  This was clearly a cut-away death scene, the creature had him on his back and was toothily moving in for the easy kill, then the scene cuts.  Later the guy's OK with no explanation (""Yeah, he had me, but then this mountain lion came outta nowhere and scared him off"").  It's those little things that stick out like a sore thumb constantly and guarantee B movie status.Oh well, there's always that creature and he looks excellent.  I could have been spared the drool in a couple of scenes (does every damn critter have to drool?), but if you love the creatures then this movie is very good for that.  Ignore the same-again plot, fast-forward through the petty, typical arguments, and check out that great monster.  I'd say fast forward through the entirely unnecessary and blatantly gratuitous shower scene, but you get a great look at the creature at the same time.  Besides, I'm sure most out there find the T & A less tiresome than I.So, don't expect a fresh plot, exciting new twists or stellar cinematography.

820726,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B00020X8F2,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[1, 2]","This is one of those cheapee direct to video schlockfests that you find yourself watching the whole thing and then saying, ""God, I can't believe I actually watched that whole movie"".  It's the classic setup of a groups of kids out in the woods who get slaughtered by a guy in a rubber suit.  Nothing wrong with that, I love that kinda thing, but it just looks and flows like any other B horror movie of recent years.  I can't put my finger on what it is, but all of these low budget movies have a look about them I don't like.  Whether it's Andre the Butcher, Arachnia or whatever, something is wrong.  At least in the good ol days even the microbudget movies were shot on film and looked like REAL movies, now everything looks like it was shot on someone's snazzy digital equipment and was probably shown on the sci-fi channel at some point.  So yeah, a lizardman is killing these kids off.  Sure, there's an attempt to add more depth and a twist in the plot, but essentially that's it.  The lizardman was created by a sexy, gun toting, biker chick scientist(only in the movies, my friends, only in the movies).  I don't know squat about genetics and such, but I'm pretty sure that injecting lizard DNA into a human won't turn them into a rampaging, rejuvinating lizardman.  Plus, the film's title is misleading because you find out what it is.  But in the end all is well and of course there's an explosion(courtesy of the handy dandy flammable gas tank that's just hanging around the creature's lair).  All in all, this was moderately entertaining schlock fare.  It's 100% heckle material all the way, so make sure you don't watch it alone.  The film doesn't go the crappy CGI route, instead leaving us with a good ol fashioned lizardman outfit.  Hey, if you're making a schlock film anyhow, might as well go with it, right?  I'd certainly rent before buying.

This is a single sided DVD (4GB) and has better video quality than most of the big-hollywood dual-layer DVDs that I have. Im watching on a 200&quot; screen with a Panasonic PT-AE500U projector, and very few DVDs I own look as good as this one. The sound is equally impressive. Whoever put this on DVD did a great job.The acting is decent too, for a B movie its far better than average.The bad stuff.The story tries to have a few twists, but if you think you know what will happen you'll probably be right. Thats the trouble with movies like this, they are one trick. If you figure it out ahead of time, its just boring to watch, especially considering all the possibilities that were ignored. This is a movie that opens alot of doors, but never even peeks into them... you have a hot mad scientist, a genetic mutant monster, 4 hot women (and a couple dorky guys) SOOO much potential there! And I dont just mean excuses to show some skin - but I digress. Instead of going somewhere the story just goes through the standard paces. If all they wanted to do was make a cutesy little pseudo murder mystery with a &quot;twist&quot; at the end, they could have just done so. Why even have a monster? Why even have a scientist? Why even have all those babes and a lab, and genetic mutation stuff.... and all this potential!?!? Argh... (yeah, im a sicko, but also the likely intended audience)Ultimately, this movie was disapointing (only a 3) because of missed great potential, with a little imagination alot more could have been done with this story and these characters. As it stands, I've seen this movie about 50 times already. Teens go to woods. Some teens die. Inconsequential plot twist. Survivors ride away. Small hint at sequel...
