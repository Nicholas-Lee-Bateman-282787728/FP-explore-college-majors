I am a HUGE fan of HP Lovecraft literature & a film buff.  So when I saw this at one of my favorite haunts (No pun intended), and saw that it was a favorite at a film festival, I felt it was worth the $20 plus purchase for it.I was wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  HP Lovecraft must be SPINNING in his grave with how bad this movie is!!!!!!!  I mean, while I can Understand it was low budget....I was not expecting something like this.  It was totally opposite of what the story was (A appalachian  man possesed by an alien entity from the Planet Pluto while he sleeps in a mental institution.).  This version makes the appalachian man look like an incestuous, multiple personality disordered, idiot.

981007,A3IBYRSA490ZOA,B000F0UUKK,C. Chow,"[2, 4]","This film is really a guilty pleasure. The words ""HP Lovecraft"" would draw any horror or scifi fan. But can a 4000 word story really be drawn out to 90 minutes?I've never read HP Lovecraft's `Beyond the Walls of Sleep' and although the plot is basic it is solid. ""Inbred"" redneck Joe (William Sanderson) is arrested for butchering his family and taken to Ulster Asylum where Dr. Edward subjects him and other patience to horrific inhumane experiments. Edward senses something more to Joe, another personality Amducious whom Edward believes is a key to unlocking an ancient evil and powerful force.If it's scary imagery you want this film has TONS of it. You will not be bored as the director relies on the proven techniques mad scientists, asylums, dark woods, and children playing. Think a 90 minute Marylyn Manson video. The photography is surprisingly good similar to Oliver Stone's style of constantly changing formats, black and white, negative, over saturation, under saturation, and fewer frames per second.The only laughably bad thing about a movie this B is the acting. It takes me back to Ed Wood's `Bride of the Monster' where evil scientists cackle. William Sanderson is the film's only REAL actor.

981008,A1L3RWD0VD0A1P,B000F0UUKK,"Cherie Priest ""Cherie Priest""","[3, 4]","In fifty words or less:  Geographically confused hillbillies inbreed for the glory of Cthulhu.  One such hillbilly has a fetal twin trying to claw its way out of his back.  This hillbilly kills his family, hears bad voices, and ends up institutionalized.  Wackiness ensues.  [Spoilers to follow.  Stop reading now if you'd prefer to avoid them.]At the institution, there's an assortment of mad doctors performing a variety of appalling experiments on patients - none more vigorously and with greater manic glee than the intern Edward Eischel.  Edward keeps a brain-dead sex slave down in the basement, her skull hinged like a Tic-Tac dispenser for the easy application of needley electrodes. Down in the lab, Edward collects brains in jars, cackles wickedly, plots the downfall of his bosses, and wears what can only be described as the worst wig in the history of movie-making.  This is a wig with such godawful presence that it permits Edward to use editorial ""we"" without sounding like a schizophrenic.  Clearly, when he says ""We'll show THEM who's in charge!"" - by ""we"" he means ""me and this-here wig.""At any rate, dear mad Edward decides that the fetal twin rearing up out of the hillbilly's back has a mind of its own, and he wants to use his wazzy electrical brain-probing equipment to make contact with it.  But as those of you who follow Lovecraft have probably guessed by now, the fetal twin is no mere biological anomaly - heavens, no.  Its name is Amducious, and it is the telepathically homicidal(?) physical representation of a hideous god-beast, who's just WAITING to burst out like a big tentacled pimple.For reasons best left unpondered, Amducious requires nine brains in order to manifest fully in this world.  Luckily for the imprisoned god-beast, Edward has already drilled a hole in his forehead for easy uplinking purposes - which yes, explains the wig, for it covers his shaved scalp with the makeshift USB port.  Edward and his vegetable-minded, pop-top honey (Ardelia) wreak havoc on the asylum, popping off heads and arranging them on pikes until they form the world's most unlikely LAN party.  Once all the brains are connected via wires, needles, and electrodes, to Edward - bad things happen. Amducious crawls up out of the hillbilly's backside and what had previously appeared to be ""havoc in the process of being wreaked"" now looks like a tea party because oh God, here comes the REALLY bad stuff ... except that the only sane and surviving doctor in the asylum has showed up with a hatchet.This doctor busts up the electrical equipment, which (a). floors Edward and Ardelia and (b). also topples Amducious, even though he's already out and walking around - which didn't make any sense to me, but whatever.  The next scene features poor Edward in a straitjacket and a padded room, while the hatchet-wielding doctor looks on and shakes his head.  Roll credits.Okay.  There were a few things to like about this movie - let there be no doubt.  First of all, some of the direction was very, very good.  The use of black and white and the camera angles occasionally teetered toward brilliance; and Tom Savini did the make-up work (and drops by for a bit part), so that much was also laudable.  There were several good actors - including William Sanderson (who deftly portrayed the afflicted hillbilly), and Rachel Mellendorf - who was um, really good at looking brain-dead.But by and large the actors you're forced to spend the most time with are flat to the point of being grating.  Edward was so bad as to be hilarious, and the foul-mouthed alienist had the worst dialogue I've ever heard.  Bully on him, for knowing the F word in 1911; but every forty-five-second, spittle-flecked spiel would have been more effective at half the length.  And let us touch upon the never-ending TOOL video, shall we?  Shocky, Silent Hill-esque pastiches of freaky footage are effective, like, once in awhile.  But ten minute stretches of them weary the eyeballs and strain the attention span, I'm just saying.  We get it - children are creepy.  Hillbillies are creepy.  Ring-around-the-rosie is creepy.Actually, ""Ring Around the Rosie"" is about to achieve the same status as cornfields in horror movies.  We all know about corn, right?  Crop of the damned.  Ask Alfred Hitchcock, M. Night Shyamalan, or Stephen King - don't plant corn.  Nothing good will come of it.  If it's tall enough to hide YOU, it's tall enough to hide homicidal maniacs/aliens/demon children/etc.  Plant strawberries instead; or plant something knee-high, at any rate.  Remember, kids:  no one ever gets mauled by fanged, skinless dog-monsters in a peanut field.But I digress.  ""Ring Around the Rosey"" is fast becoming the de facto signifier of wicked little children what ain't like they seem.  Perhaps it's because of the plague myth of the song's inception; or perhaps it's just because it's easily recognizable and easy to remember.  I don't know.  But regardless, I am instantly suspicious of any story that uses ""Ring Around the Rosey"" as an atmospheric shortcut.  It smacks of laziness.So I say all that to say this:  Beyond the Wall of Sleep was not by any means the worst low-budget horror film I've ever subjected myself to - far from it.  But there was a lot wrong that would've been easy to fix (different actors, less epilepsy-inducing cut-scene tedium), and therefore, it disappoints me.  It's worth renting with a bottle of booze and a few good friends with a penchant for MST3K, but otherwise, leave it wherever you find it - and don't let it follow you home.",2,oy. my

Descent storyline (based on H.P. Lovecraft) that just streached out to long. An intern in an asylum discovers a new way to harness human thought in those who cannot speak for themselves, sounds good, done poorly.The Gore factor got old within the first 20 minutes.  The acting was, well not there, some folks just reading there lines, some in bad inbred accents, others in bad German accents.  I feel it did no justice to the Psychiatric field, just riddled with horrible inaccuracies.  Tom Cruise would love this film, because he's use it as propaganda against Psychiatry.  Finally, just plain predictable, didn't hold my attention.Pluses: Neat camera work, intresting splicing of film and scenes.Minuses: as noted above.Again, if you like B horror films, this would be up your alley, but don't be mislead that this may be a descent horror film because it has H.P.

Most of the reviewers on this page are either 1st time reviewers who may very well have something to do with the movie or are bias H.P.Lovecraft fans who would rather the story be told the right way even if the acting is at an atrocious highschool level. With that said in my opinion beyond the wall of truly bad acting & direction there is a great Lovecraft story here & this comes from a huge fan of the art of low-budget film making. You see you can have bad actors with a decent story as long as you have a good freshly creative Director/moveing picture story teller that will give the audience a labor of love outcome but when you take a great H.P.Lovecraft story a very bad Director & horrid acting along with ridiculously bad editing your outcome is a chicken with a good idea running around with it's head cutt off,so be very careful horror film fans & don't be fooled by all these phony good reviews like I was because this one is definetly not good & it is also not one of those it's so bad it's good kinda flicks it is simply all around horrible!

981011,A2BVNMTD504LHC,B000F0UUKK,Edward E. Rom,"[1, 3]","Some of the other reviewers give synopses of the plot, so I'll skip that, and just make a few observations.First, I have to point out that I'm a fairly big fan of H. P. Lovecraft's work, but -- and this is an IMPORTANT but -- I understand that it's fairly difficult to translate the written word into cinema, so, unlike some of the extreme purists out there, I don't expect a movie to be much like the story it's adapted from. If I expected that, I would hate most of the films I watch.I liked the technique used in making this film, that is, the black and white alternated with color etc.  This might be old hat to some people, but I haven't seen much of it, and I at least like this sample of it.What I really like about this movie is its relentlessly over-the-top quality.

Even the difference between the home of the inbreds and the asylum is blurred to nonexistense - it is the same filth, the same loonies walking around unattended, and in the cellars unspeakable cruelties take place. In this the filmmmakers expertly captures what Lovecraft really writes about.Of course, the framework, the police interview, hints that something is going to go horribly wrong sometime after the film ends, but that again is true to the spirit of Lovecraft.

But, like almost every other newer horror film, it was a complete dissapointment.First of all, the cover is misleading. That thing on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie; Second thing is that the synopsis on the back of the DVD is more entertaining then the movie itself. The movie stars William Sanderson (HBO's ""Deadwood"") as Joe Slaader, a clearly inbred man who is placed in the Ulster County Asylum for killing his family. Problem is, we never truly see him do this. As the doctors begin studying Joe, they notice an odd and unique deformity on his back. One of the doctors who takes particular notice to Joe is Ed Eischel (Fountain Yount), who seems sane but turns out be almost worse than Joe. Ed does experiments involving brain waves, one of his experiments is a young girl who is strapped to a chair below the asylum...Did I mention the top of her head was cut off exposing her brain? Anyway, Ed discovers that the deformity on Joe's back is actually another being...One who happenst to be a lot smarter than Joe, so Eischel begins doing experiments to bring the being out of Joe and into the real world. Now, not only is the story really stupid and really boring...But the film looks horrible. The cinematography is just bad. The movie is in black and white, for the most part, but will change to color for random moments (kind of like ""Natural Born Killers"" except that movie was good). The plot almost isn't there, because the director attempts to use visuals at times to get his point across. I mean, there's things going on in the movie that I didn't even know about. Oh and then there's the monster that pops out of Joe's back (I forget it's name), but it looks like a cheap video game monster. It's excrutiatingly horrible. The movie isn't disturbing, horrifying, scary, or even funny. It's one of the worst horror films I've seen this year and one of the worst I've seen ever.

The main lead was very weak. If this film had better actors it would have worked better. A Jeffery Combs [or an actor with his talent], from Re Animator could have carried the material better. Only a few actors were professional in their delivery. However when you buy a low budget film you must expect this, but that was the least of the problems.

981028,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000F0UUKK,Tim Janson,"[11, 19]","Despite what others have said Beyond the Wall of Sleep is a pretty faithful adaptation of the Lovecraft story.  People seem to forget that this is a short story.  Just over 4000 words or so.  Obviously if you are going to turn it into a film it's going to require a lot of padding to fill out 90 or so minutes.  Sometimes Lovecraft purists can be a bit insufferable in their whining about films remaining faithful to Lovecraft's original stories.  By nature they are not well-suited for the big screen and HPL would probably be the first to admit it as he relied so much on atmosphere as opposed to action and dialog.  That said most Lovecraft fans have tended to have low expectations of any films based on his works so that's why this one comes as a bit of a refreshing surprise.Is it a masterpiece?  Heck no...but it is heavy on atmosphere and downright creepy in many spots.  It's low-budget does show up in spots but for what they worked with, they did a good job, especially in some of the gore-filled scenes which are quite twisted.  William Sanderson, best known as one of the trio of country bumpkin brothers from Newhart plays the crazed mountain man Joe Slaader who is locked away in an asylum.  Sanderson is pretty unrecognizable and one of the strongest points of the film.  Fountain Yount as the intern doesn't fare quite as well in his very first screen credit but he's not horrible.There are editing glitches and a bit too much reliance on overused horror clich&eacute;s but all in all Beyond the Wall of Sleep was satisfying.Reviewed by Tim Janson",4,A SOLID LOVECRAFT ADAPTATION,1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,1564,"['what', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'Beyond', 'Wall', 'Sleep', 'pretty', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Lovecraft', 'story', 'People', 'seem', 'forget', 'short', 'story', 'Just', '4000', 'words', 'so', 'Obviously', 'are', 'going', 'turn', 'film', 'going', 'require', 'lot', 'padding', 'fill', 'out', '90', 'so', 'minutes', 'Sometimes', 'Lovecraft', 'purists', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'insufferable', 'whining', 'films', 'remaining', 'faithful', 'Lovecraft', 'original', 'stories', 'nature', 'are', 'not', 'well-suited', 'big', 'screen', 'HPL', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'relied', 'so', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'opposed', 'action', 'dialog', 'said', 'most', 'Lovecraft', 'fans', 'have', 'tended', 'have', 'low', 'expectations', 'films', 'based', 'works', 'why', 'one', 'bit', 'refreshing', 'surprise.Is', 'masterpiece', 'Heck', 'heavy', 'atmosphere', 'downright', 'creepy', 'many', 'spots', 'low-budget', 'show', 'up', 'spots', 'what', 'worked', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'especially', 'gore-filled', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'twisted', 'William', 'Sanderson', 'best', 'known', 'one', 'trio', 'country', 'bumpkin', 'brothers', 'Newhart', 'crazed', 'mountain', 'man', 'Joe', 'Slaader', 'who', 'locked', 'away', 'asylum', 'Sanderson', 'pretty', 'unrecognizable', 'one', 'strongest', 'points', 'film', 'Fountain', 'Yount', 'intern', ""n't"", 'fare', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'first', 'screen', 'credit', 'not', 'are', 'editing', 'glitches', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'reliance', 'overused', 'horror', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Beyond', 'Wall', 'Sleep', 'was', 'satisfying.Reviewed', 'Tim', 'Janson']",Beyond The Wall Of Sleep
