All African Americans who see this film should see the importance of working hard and getting an education. We have to strive for excellence in life. Levar and Lou were great as usual but Avery's performance really touched me. A welcome addition to the Roots saga. A must see for fans of Roots.,5,I cried!,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,394,"['film', 'very', 'powerful', 'made', 'very', 'angry', 'Slavery', 'was', 'evil', 'thing', 'hurt', 'people', 'African', 'Americans', 'who', 'see', 'film', 'should', 'see', 'importance', 'working', 'hard', 'getting', 'education', 'have', 'strive', 'excellence', 'life', 'Levar', 'Lou', 'were', 'great', 'usual', 'Avery', 'performance', 'really', 'touched', 'welcome', 'addition', 'Roots', 'saga', 'must', 'see', 'fans', 'Roots']",Roots: The Gift VHS

Supringly it was not until Christmas 2002 that I discovered RTG.  The story of RTG takes places sometime in between Vol II and III.  Levar Burton returns as Kunta, and Louis Gossett Jr. returns as the Fidler.  I do not wish to give the entire plot away, but will say that Kunta gets another shot as escape (as well as Fidler) but turns down the opportunity.  The plot and story on this one was not quite as good as the others, but the director seems to be of the same quality, and the music score is also the same.  The feel of the film is like the others.  However outside of Levar and Louis all the actors are different.  One of the actors laters goes on to play in the X-files.However I will say that this movie tires allot faster than the other Roots.  My other gripe is the lack of this movie on DVD.  It should have beeen released on DVD by this time.",4,Excellent film!,1122681600,"07 30, 2005",2005,960,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Roots', 'Vol', '1-6', 'was', 'introduced', 'High', 'School', 'history', 'class', '1995', 'Supringly', 'was', 'not', 'Christmas', '2002', 'discovered', 'RTG', 'story', 'RTG', 'places', 'sometime', 'Vol', 'II', 'III', 'Levar', 'Burton', 'Kunta', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'Fidler', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'give', 'entire', 'plot', 'away', 'will', 'say', 'Kunta', 'shot', 'escape', 'as', 'well', 'Fidler', 'down', 'opportunity', 'plot', 'story', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'others', 'director', 'be', 'same', 'quality', 'music', 'score', 'also', 'same', 'feel', 'film', 'others', 'However', 'Levar', 'Louis', 'actors', 'are', 'different', 'One', 'actors', 'laters', 'play', 'X-files.However', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'allot', 'faster', 'other', 'Roots', 'other', 'gripe', 'lack', 'movie', 'DVD', 'should', 'have', 'beeen', 'released', 'DVD', 'time']",Roots: The Gift VHS

That is not what attracted me to this movie.  Self-sacrifice and the true meaning of Christmas did.There are several gifts that I saw in this movie.  The next generation of children that realize slavery is wrong.  The older brother explaining how he feels about slavery to the younger sister and she said to Fiddler that Toby doesn't have to be her camel in the Christmas Pagent. The mother's gift to wait until after the holidays to tell the father about her son being an abolitionist.The sacrifice Avery Brooks' character makes when, as a freed slave, he puts his life on the line to help lead others to freedom through the underground railroad.  He actually gets caught and has to wear a collar of bells.  They end up hanging him because he is an abolitionist and educated to boot.  I like it when he shouts out the word freedom.Fiddler puts his own hide on the line trying to keep Kunta Kinte out of trouble when he covers for Toby when he isn't on the plantation and when he tries to stop the slave catchers from brutalizing Avery Brooks' character.The promise of a free black child and the ultimate sacrifice both Fiddler and Toby make by deciding not to get on the boat.  Actually Fiddler confesses to the abolitionist that he knows nothing about being free.  Kunta Kinte remembers his life in Africa before the slave traders caught him.  Fiddler also realizes that he may not survive another winter on the plantation, but Toby will not leave without him.This was an excellent movie.  I plan to watch it again when it comes on cable.",5,I'm glad I saw this movie.,1007856000,"12 9, 2001",2001,1735,"['was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'did', 'Roots', 'Christmas', 'story', 'read', 'description', 'cable', 'guide.I', 'am', 'willing', 'look', 'slavery', 'issue', 'movie', 'fake', 'southern', 'accents', 'too', 'not', 'what', 'attracted', 'movie', 'Self-sacrifice', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'are', 'several', 'gifts', 'saw', 'movie', 'next', 'generation', 'children', 'realize', 'slavery', 'wrong', 'older', 'brother', 'explaining', 'how', 'about', 'slavery', 'younger', 'sister', 'said', 'Fiddler', 'Toby', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'camel', 'Christmas', 'Pagent', 'mother', 'gift', 'wait', 'holidays', 'tell', 'father', 'son', 'being', 'abolitionist.The', 'sacrifice', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'character', 'when', 'freed', 'slave', 'life', 'line', 'help', 'lead', 'others', 'freedom', 'underground', 'railroad', 'actually', 'caught', 'wear', 'collar', 'bells', 'end', 'up', 'hanging', 'abolitionist', 'educated', 'boot', 'like', 'when', 'out', 'word', 'freedom.Fiddler', 'own', 'hide', 'line', 'trying', 'keep', 'Kunta', 'Kinte', 'trouble', 'when', 'Toby', 'when', ""n't"", 'plantation', 'when', 'stop', 'slave', 'catchers', 'brutalizing', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'character.The', 'promise', 'free', 'black', 'child', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'Fiddler', 'Toby', 'make', 'deciding', 'not', 'get', 'boat', 'Actually', 'Fiddler', 'abolitionist', 'nothing', 'being', 'free', 'Kunta', 'Kinte', 'life', 'Africa', 'slave', 'traders', 'caught', 'Fiddler', 'also', 'may', 'not', 'survive', 'winter', 'plantation', 'Toby', 'will', 'not', 'leave', 'him.This', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'plan', 'watch', 'again', 'when', 'cable']",Roots: The Gift VHS

Louis Gossett,Jr., and Levar Burton were terrific just as they were in the original ROOTS. We only see about five minutes of Michael Learned, which is a shame because she is such a good actress, I think they could have expanded her role.

The cast of characters provides a window into these different aspects of society from the rich overbearing masters to the lowly slaves. (With actors such as Avery Brooks, LeVar Burton, Kate Mulgrew, and Tim Russ, it is a must see for all Star Trek fans.)  I found the story moving, especially the climax, which is a endearing scene of self-sacrifice.
