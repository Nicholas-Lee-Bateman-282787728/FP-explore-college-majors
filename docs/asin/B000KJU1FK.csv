1034776,A10XJR7CWHNKWU,B000KJU1FK,Alan Caylow,"[3, 3]","The American version of ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" is fine, but it just doesn't compare with the original British version. I used to watch this show religiously on Comedy Central, and there were times when I'd laugh so hard I'd cry. That's how funny the British version of ""Whose Line"" can be when all four players are operating on the same comic wavelength, with the marvelous ringmaster Clive Anderson overlooking the proceedings. Sure, there are gags that misfire, but so what? That's the risk of improv comedy! I have the deepest respect & admiration for the regulars on the UK ""Whose Line,"" such as John Sessions, Josie Lawrence, Tony Slattery, Paul Merton, Sandi Toksvig, and regular American performers like Michael McShane, Greg Proops, Archie Hahn, and Ryan Stiles (though he's Canadian), to name a few. There are other performers who appeared less often (or only once!), like Peter Cook, Jonathan Pryce, Griff Rhys-Jones, Arthur Smith & Jimmy Mulville, but they all still left their mark on this hilarious show, too. I don't know how they manage to come up with this stuff right on the spot, but it really is amazing to watch. For me, watching the British ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" is like spending time with very good, very funny & talented friends who just want to entertain you and who don't mind looking the fool if it makes you laugh. While there's no question that some episodes are funnier than others, the genuinely funny episodes are glorious comic gems that you can enjoy again and again. You'll know which episodes they are when you see them (I'll give you a hint, though: the early episodes are funny enough, but things *really* kick into high gear when Michael McShane joins the contestants in episode 10). I'm thrilled that seasons 1 & 2 of the original ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" are now on DVD in this excellent, affordable box set package. However, keep in mind that these are only the first two seasons! There are many more improv comedy treats to enjoy in the seasons to come (there are ten in all), so don't let us down, A&E.

1034777,A3GKMK6KQH3Y1H,B000KJU1FK,B. Niedt,"[4, 5]","If you've only seen and enjoyed the American version of this show hosted by Drew Carey, you're in for a treat.  This is the original, which debuted on Britain's Channel Four in 1988 and ran for ten seasons, later becoming a staple here in the States on Comedy Central. It started off with an all-British cast and weekly regular John Sessions, as well as occasional guests you might recognize like Stephen Fry, Peter Cook and Jonathan Pryce. Soon regulars like Tony Slattery, Paul Merton, Sandy Toksvig, and the wonderful Josie Lawrence joined the cast, and occasionally a North American might be thrown into the mix - Mike McShane was probably the most frequently-appearing and funniest of the Americans in the first two seasons, but other future U.S.-version regulars like Ryan Stiles and Greg Proops appeared as well. The show started off rather dry and cerebral but often quite funny, and as some of the more animated cast members joined, it got more raucous and even a bit bawdy. U.S. viewers may not get some of the distinctly British references, but they'll recognize some of the ""games"" adopted for the U.S. version, like ""Party Quirks"", ""Props"", and ""Song Stylings"", the last of which really gave Lawrence and McShane a chance to shine. And though host Clive Anderson might seem like a ""stiff"" compared to Drew Carey, he has his own distinct brand of dry wit.  This set is ""uncensored"" so it contains some lines and scenes that have never appeared on American TV.  There aren't many ""extras"", but the interview with producers Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson is interesting. (Did you know that they turned down Mike Myers and Steve Carell in American auditions for the show?)  The price is right, too, for a couple dozen episodes of one of the funniest shows on TV.

1034778,ACJVGDN8G386P,B000KJU1FK,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[1, 1]","High quality sketch comedy was dormant for about 15 years after the last episodes of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" aired before another rivaled it. By the 1990's, the UK improv television show, ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"", was the first sketch comedy show to equal the originality of Monty Python, even when you take into consideration Saturday Night Live which has always been rather mixed in the effectiveness and funny department. The later US version of ""Whose Line"" was decent but was never quite as entertaining as the original British offering which had a subtle spontaneity lacking from most other comedy shows on both sides of the pond.Unlike ""Flying Circus"" and ""Saturday Night Live"" which were scripted, ""Whose Line Is It Anyway"" was entirely improvised. The host, Clive Anderson, would moderate four comedian/contestants and contrive interesting and often wacky scenarios upon which the contestants would then improvise. These could be scenes, songs, or just dialog. Aside from Anderson's often quirky settings, inspiration could come from the audience members whom Anderson would ask to come up with characters and/or places which the contestants would then act on. At the end of each show, Anderson would decide the winner who would read the credits in a style of Anderson's choosing.One of the reasons the show worked so well was the endless plethora of material since the performers could act out any situation, which could be a bank, a prison, a hardware store, or any number of settings, either mundane or sophisticated. They enacted scenes in the style of genre movies, like westerns and horror movies, film noir and romance. They could act out historical figures, movie/television actors, or characters completely made up. One favorite was having three of the performers each play a character with some strange quirk (like one person believing he's Superman) and arrive at a party in which the host has to figure out who they are. Another was a scene in which two performers have a dialog in which they can only ask questions. They even improvised the lyrics of songs which always stunned me.Many great stand-up and comedic talent were put through Anderson's ringers, and I don't believe there was ever a weak link. However, two talents stood out beyond most of the rest (in more ways than one), which were the American Ryan Stiles and the Scotsman Colin Mochrie. Whenever either of them were among the performers, and particularly if both were at Anderson's disposal, you were guaranteed an half hour of incredible comedic entertainment. I honestly don't know how these guys did what they did. Their improvised lines were as good and often better than scripted TV shows being shown on other stations. In one scene, Mochire and Stiles are at a bank vault. Whiles Stiles is pretending to be sealing the vault, Mochrie says ""Why are you putting my wife in there?"" Without a moment's hesitation, Stiles replies, ""Collateral.""Despite much of the mediocre shows offered by the networks in the 1990's, particularly in the United States (barring Seinfeld) ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" demonstrated how much mileage could be gotten without a huge budget or elaborate productions. There were no sets, no costumes, no writers, and no scripts. Only four performers, a stage, an occasional chair or two, and a moderator. And ten years of some of the funniest television I have ever seen.

My advice: flounder through these first 2-3 episodes. There are gems of genius strewn even in those episodes, especially with Jacie and Tony Slattery. Very soon it becomes evident that the actors are warming up to the innovative format. Season 2 is fabulous and you can see that unlike Drew Carry, Clive Anderson does not get involved with his participants, which actually lends more credibility to the whole affair.Oh, and the starting credits for each episode are fun, a caper that was dropped in the US version. This is a prized possession.

Compared to the American show, it moves pretty slowly, and offers little variety.  They just do the same ""games"" every week, and some of them aren't that great.  They did have some wonderful guest stars, but some were equally bad.  Definitely worth watching if you're a BritCom fan or a Whose Line fan, but it won't exactly change your life.",3,"Good, but not great",1267056000,"02 25, 2010",2010,461,"['loved', 'American', 'Whose', 'Line', 'even', 'also', 'love', 'British', 'comedy', 'show', 'often', 'short', 'greatness', 'Compared', 'American', 'show', 'pretty', 'slowly', 'little', 'variety', 'just', 'do', 'same', 'games', 'week', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'did', 'have', 'wonderful', 'guest', 'stars', 'were', 'equally', 'bad', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'watching', ""'re"", 'BritCom', 'fan', 'Whose', 'Line', 'fan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'change', 'life']",Whose Line Is It Anyway: Season 1 & 2
