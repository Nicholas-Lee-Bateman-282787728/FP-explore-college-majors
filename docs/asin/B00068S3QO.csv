863576,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,B00068S3QO,A. Schneider,"[3, 4]","I had the absolute pleasure of attending a local French Film Festival and seeing ""Confidences trop intimes"" by Parisian filmmaker Patrice Leconte. I wasn't quite sure what to expect after reading the film's description and figured it would end up being a somewhat interesting short film.I was pleasantly surprised to find myself eagerly awaiting each and every scene as though I was watching a suspense movie or a thriller! From the moment the mysterious and emotionally distraught Anna (played by the adorable Sandrine Bonnaire) walked into the quirky tax accountant's office thinking he was a psychologist (played by the amazing Fabrice Luchini), I was eagerly awaiting scene after scene.One of the most beautiful things about this movie is that it is, in a very classic way, a love story! The unspoken tension builds between Anna and William (the tax accountant) as the film unfolds as Anna's counter transference of emotional burdens shifts to her ""therapist."" Deep character emotions unlock, personalities bloom and deep seeded character development is ever present throughout the film.One of the most enjoyable aspects of this movie is the above-par acting! Fabrice Luchini has such a face that he seems to capture a thousand emotions simply by staring off into the camera with his bright blue eyes, and Ms. Bonnaire's performance is outstanding as well - her soft, gentle features captivates the audience at once entangling them in her character's life story.Truly an excellent film well worth seeing for anyone with a heart, treat yourself to ""Confidences trop intimes"" today!",5,Truly beautiful!,1148515200,"05 25, 2006",2006,1584,"['had', 'absolute', 'pleasure', 'attending', 'local', 'French', 'Film', 'Festival', 'seeing', 'Confidences', 'trop', 'intimes', 'Parisian', 'filmmaker', 'Patrice', 'Leconte', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'reading', 'film', 'description', 'figured', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'short', 'film.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'scene', 'was', 'watching', 'suspense', 'movie', 'thriller', 'moment', 'mysterious', 'emotionally', 'distraught', 'Anna', 'played', 'adorable', 'Sandrine', 'Bonnaire', 'walked', 'quirky', 'tax', 'accountant', 'office', 'thinking', 'was', 'psychologist', 'played', 'amazing', 'Fabrice', 'Luchini', 'was', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'scene', 'scene.One', 'most', 'beautiful', 'things', 'movie', 'very', 'classic', 'way', 'love', 'story', 'unspoken', 'tension', 'builds', 'Anna', 'William', 'tax', 'accountant', 'film', 'unfolds', 'Anna', 'counter', 'transference', 'emotional', 'burdens', 'shifts', 'therapist', 'Deep', 'character', 'emotions', 'unlock', 'personalities', 'bloom', 'deep', 'seeded', 'character', 'development', 'ever', 'present', 'film.One', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'aspects', 'movie', 'above-par', 'acting', 'Fabrice', 'Luchini', 'face', 'capture', 'thousand', 'emotions', 'simply', 'staring', 'off', 'camera', 'bright', 'blue', 'eyes', 'Ms.', 'Bonnaire', 'performance', 'outstanding', 'as', 'well', 'soft', 'gentle', 'features', 'audience', 'once', 'entangling', 'character', 'life', 'story.Truly', 'excellent', 'film', 'well', 'seeing', 'anyone', 'heart', 'treat', 'Confidences', 'trop', 'intimes', 'today']",N/A

There's a dark undercurrent of violence that never explodes and leaves you awaiting something much darker that seems about to happen, but never does.

863580,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00068S3QO,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 4]","This is the most nuanced of Patrice Leconte's films that I have seen.  Everything is carefully constructed at a measured pace with just enough revelation as we go along, but no more, so that we can follow the plot's development easily.  The film is cut as close as a barber's shave and is as neat as a pin.Anna (Sandrine Bonnaire), who is a bit of a tease, finds herself in what she thinks is a shrink's office.  (There's a magazine on the desk whose title is partially obscured so that only the word ""analyst"" appears to her eyes, thereby confirming her expectations.)  Behind the desk however is William Faber (Fabrice Luchini) who is a tax accountant and perhaps the last man in the building who could conceivable help Anna with her marital problem.  He is after all something of recluse.  He doesn't drive.  He usually eats alone in his apartment, which apparently is the same place as his office, watching TV (in one scene it's Humphrey Bogart as Phillip Marlowe with French subtitles).  He is only marginally experienced in the ways of human relationships and knows little about psychoanalysis.  (The ""analyst"" magazine on his desk was on economic analysis.)She flips a zippo cigarette lighter, lights a cigarette like someone new to smoking, and begins to tell a somewhat astonished Faber about the intimate details of her married life, mainly that her husband won't touch her anymore.I previously saw Bonnaire in La Ceremonie (1995), directed by Claude Chabrol, in which she played a mean, hateful housemaid, and she was very good there.  Here she is playful, almost childish at times, as she reveals her life to this stranger.This is the first time I have seen Luchini who is very properly Parisian in his carefully knotted tie (worn even while preparing his solitary meal).  His acting style is markedly laid back.  He carries an almost continual look of surprise on his face--astonishment almost--with his eyes made big and round and his demeanor controlled and taciturn.Because Anna is so direct and begins talking about herself almost immediately and because Faber is a most polite man who will not interrupt her, it is several minutes before he has the opportunity to advise her that she really wants the office down the hall where the psychoanalyst Dr. Monnier holds forth.  By then he is intrigued with her and smitten, and is slow, very slow, to advise her of her error.Also because Anna likes to talk about herself like a teenager and because William Faber is a practiced listener, there is a certain simpatico that automatically develops.One can see where this is heading.  She talks, he listens.  She performs, so to speak; he appreciates.  Faber is the kind of man, as his ""ex"" points out, who never makes the first move.  This is good for Anna because it allows her to become comfortable with him before she has to respond.The complications begin with the appearance of Anna's husband who first makes an unusual sexual demand of the very proper tax accountant, and then when that is refused, treats Faber to a most upsetting motel scene through a window across the way.  Yes, it's a little contrived (as is the movie's premise).  But I like the way Leconte didn't let us see the scene and only revealed later what Faber had seen.Near the end of the film we see Faber for the first time sans necktie, which we can guess signals a change in the man.  The film ends in a most artistic way with a shot from above as Anna lies stretched out on a classic analyst's couch in a cute frock with her ankles crossed and Faber...  Well, we see the credits roll down the screen and we can imagine what will eventually happen.My favorite Leconte film is Ridicule (1996).  I also liked his La Fille sur la pont (1999).  If you haven't seen his work you are in for a treat.  He is witty in a sly way (especially here in Confidence trop intimes) and can be strikingly original.  Like all good directors, he never loses track of the audience and the needs of the audience.  His films are carefully cut so that we always know what is going on, but without any heavy-handedness.See this for Patrice Leconte, one of France's most talented film makers.",4,"An unusual love story, nicely realized",1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,4152,"['most', 'nuanced', 'Patrice', 'Leconte', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'Everything', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'measured', 'pace', 'just', 'enough', 'revelation', 'go', 'along', 'more', 'can', 'follow', 'plot', 'development', 'easily', 'film', 'cut', 'as', 'close', 'barber', 'shave', 'as', 'neat', 'pin.Anna', 'Sandrine', 'Bonnaire', 'who', 'bit', 'tease', 'what', 'shrink', 'office', 'magazine', 'desk', 'title', 'partially', 'obscured', 'so', 'only', 'word', 'analyst', 'eyes', 'thereby', 'confirming', 'expectations', 'desk', 'however', 'William', 'Faber', 'Fabrice', 'Luchini', 'who', 'tax', 'accountant', 'perhaps', 'last', 'man', 'building', 'who', 'could', 'conceivable', 'help', 'Anna', 'marital', 'problem', 'something', 'recluse', ""n't"", 'drive', 'usually', 'alone', 'apartment', 'apparently', 'same', 'place', 'office', 'watching', 'TV', 'one', 'scene', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Phillip', 'Marlowe', 'French', 'subtitles', 'only', 'marginally', 'experienced', 'ways', 'human', 'relationships', 'little', 'psychoanalysis', 'analyst', 'magazine', 'desk', 'was', 'economic', 'analysis', 'zippo', 'cigarette', 'lighter', 'cigarette', 'someone', 'new', 'smoking', 'tell', 'somewhat', 'astonished', 'Faber', 'intimate', 'details', 'married', 'life', 'mainly', 'husband', 'wo', ""n't"", 'touch', 'anymore.I', 'previously', 'saw', 'Bonnaire', 'La', 'Ceremonie', '1995', 'directed', 'Claude', 'Chabrol', 'played', 'mean', 'hateful', 'housemaid', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'there', 'Here', 'playful', 'almost', 'childish', 'times', 'life', 'stranger.This', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'Luchini', 'who', 'very', 'properly', 'Parisian', 'carefully', 'knotted', 'tie', 'worn', 'even', 'preparing', 'solitary', 'meal', 'acting', 'style', 'markedly', 'laid', 'back', 'almost', 'continual', 'look', 'surprise', 'face', 'astonishment', 'almost', 'eyes', 'made', 'big', 'round', 'demeanor', 'controlled', 'taciturn.Because', 'Anna', 'so', 'direct', 'talking', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Faber', 'most', 'polite', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'interrupt', 'several', 'minutes', 'opportunity', 'advise', 'really', 'office', 'down', 'hall', 'where', 'psychoanalyst', 'Dr.', 'Monnier', 'forth', 'then', 'intrigued', 'smitten', 'slow', 'very', 'slow', 'advise', 'her', 'error.Also', 'Anna', 'talk', 'teenager', 'William', 'Faber', 'practiced', 'listener', 'certain', 'simpatico', 'automatically', 'develops.One', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'heading', 'so', 'speak', 'Faber', 'kind', 'man', 'ex', 'points', 'out', 'who', 'never', 'first', 'move', 'good', 'Anna', 'become', 'comfortable', 'respond.The', 'complications', 'begin', 'appearance', 'Anna', 'husband', 'who', 'first', 'unusual', 'sexual', 'demand', 'very', 'proper', 'tax', 'accountant', 'then', 'when', 'refused', 'Faber', 'most', 'upsetting', 'motel', 'scene', 'window', 'way', 'Yes', 'little', 'contrived', 'movie', 'premise', 'like', 'way', 'Leconte', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'see', 'scene', 'only', 'revealed', 'later', 'what', 'Faber', 'had', 'seen.Near', 'end', 'film', 'see', 'Faber', 'first', 'time', 'sans', 'necktie', 'can', 'guess', 'signals', 'change', 'man', 'film', 'most', 'artistic', 'way', 'shot', 'Anna', 'stretched', 'out', 'classic', 'analyst', 'couch', 'cute', 'frock', 'ankles', 'crossed', 'Faber', 'Well', 'see', 'credits', 'roll', 'down', 'screen', 'can', 'imagine', 'what', 'will', 'eventually', 'happen.My', 'favorite', 'Leconte', 'film', 'Ridicule', '1996', 'also', 'liked', 'La', 'Fille', 'sur', 'la', 'pont', '1999', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'work', 'are', 'treat', 'witty', 'sly', 'way', 'especially', 'here', 'Confidence', 'trop', 'intimes', 'can', 'be', 'strikingly', 'original', 'good', 'directors', 'never', 'track', 'audience', 'needs', 'audience', 'films', 'are', 'carefully', 'cut', 'so', 'always', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'heavy-handedness.See', 'Patrice', 'Leconte', 'one', 'France', 'most', 'talented', 'film', 'makers']",N/A
863581,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00068S3QO,Doug Anderson,"[4, 6]","This film has a premise that sounds like the beginning of a joke: a girl walks into a tax attorneys office thinking she has entered her psychoanalysts office. The problem is that the joke never really takes off, and it takes a long time to tell. As a result I found myself waiting in vain for something momentous to happen, or some momentous twist to occur, or something that resembles a punchline, but ultimately all of the mysterious Hitchcockian atmospherics (eerie mystery music, strangers appearing and disappearing, misunderstandings & miscommunications, lots of shots down hallways, odd characters with odd obsessions/compulsions)are for nought. That's not to say this film does not have some things going for it. For me the best character was the real psychoanalyst down the hall (the one the girl was trying to see when she entered the tax attorneys office) who advises the tax-attorney-pretend-psychoanalyst to give up on the idea of mastering situations.  This is actually probably good advice and probably the kind of advice you would expect to get from a man who has long accepted the idea that psychoanalysts are just there to listen and that the psychoanalytic situation itself is therapeutic. But its also funny because the real psychonalyst is a jaded pro who's heard it all. His odd attempt at Freudian humor (part Freudian slip, part juvenalia) is the funniest bit in the film, and his lines about ""payment being part of the therapy"" and ""female pleasure being frightening to men"" are delivered with ice cold seriousness.  Its obvious to this ""real"" psychoanalyst that the tax attorney has his own problems to work through and that he is growing to depend on his visitor-patient as much as she depends on him. If you're ok with just watching two people attempt to sort out their lives for 1 hr. and 44 min. then you may find this film interesting. If you're looking for something with more thrills then this will probably disappoint.The tax attorney William (Fabrice Luchini) is, in moments anyway, vividly imagined by director Patrice Leconte and even though the interloper Anna (Sandrine Bonnaire) has an endless collection of now steamy, now tragic anecdotes to tell about herself its really not Anna that we are interested in but the effects Anna's tales have on William. Both William and Anna are in or have just been in unsatisfying relationships and both seem to feel empowered by the other to pursue something better. Anna is still young enough to make life changes and pursue a dream she has had since childhood; the question for William (who has never really left his childhood home nor his childhood) is whether he is capable of imagining a life outside of his tax office routines.  Its ultimately a film that some may view as sad and others may view as touching and very human and maybe even sweet. For me the peripheral characters really provide a much needed break form William and Anna (Williams verbal jabs at his ex's new boyfriend are very funny-- rare bits of comic agression for William). Patrice Leconte seems to enjoy teasing viewers into believing that they are going to get a Hitchcockian mystery and then giving them something a little more substantial, if also a little less thrilling, than that.This film has a few quirky moments that I really enjoyed and that made me think of my favorite Leconte films, Monsieur Hire & Hairdressers Husband. Unfortunatley the film has far too few of these and it moves much too lethargically to really elicit more than a moderate approval rating. Competent if not very inspired film making.Patrice Leconte:1989 Monsieur Hire *1990 Hairdresser's Husband *1996 Ridicule1999 Girl on the Bridge2000 Widow of Saint-Pierre *2002 Man on a Train*My favorites.

863582,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00068S3QO,Grady Harp,"[2, 4]","INTIMATE STRANGERS is another triumph for Director Patrice Leconte whose dazzling output includes 'Monsieur Hire', 'The Widow of Saint-Pierre', 'The Man on the Train', 'Tango', 'Ridicule', and 'The Girl on the Bridge'.  Taking a simple scheme for a story - a desperate woman rings the wrong doorbell for a psychologist's appointment and mistakenly opens her intimate life to a tax attorney - and weaves this quiet encounter into an exploration of relationships, alienation, intimacy, and existentialism.Sandrine Bonnaire as Anna delivers on of the most complex characters created for the screen. An actress of great beauty and talent, Bonnaire makes the disturbed Anna an intense but flighty, fragile female who is struggling to keep her husband Marc (Gilbert Mekli) from leaving her despite Marc's seemingly wasted existence.  Fabrice Luchini is William Faber, the sad-eyed boring tax lawyer to whom Anna 'assigns' the role of therapist.  William is in the throes of a wasted affair with Jeanne (Anne Brochet)  who has taken up with a weight lifter in an arrangement that is not altogether monogamous (she still drops in to see William for talk and off the cuff sex).  William remains a loner.William feels guilty about Anna's mistaking him for a therapist and almost immediately seeks advice from the intended therapist, Dr. Monnier (Michel Duchaussoy), who seems less concerned with William's situation than he is with charging for advice!  As Anna discovers William's true identity and delays her visits for a while, she eventually returns to William's kind listening and begins to unravel a sick relationship with her husband Marc. Marc eventually visits William and ultimately plays out his neuroses of the marriage with Anna in plain view of William.Anna eventually leaves Marc to follow her early dream of being involved with ballet ad almost simultaneously William makes changes in his life that lead to a surprise ending.The acting is absolutely first rate - subtle, in-depth portrayals, with everyone involved (including Helene Surgere as William's warmly curious secretary) giving us characters about whom we care and with whom we become involved. Even the cinematography by Eduardo Serra is pitch perfect for creating the ambience for this claustrophobic series of encounters.  This is a strange story but one filled with questions about how we relate to strangers, to lovers, to co-workers, to people at large.

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[34, 36]","Anna, (Sandrine Bonnaire), opens the wrong door and ends up in the office of tax attorney William Faber, (Fabrice Luchini), instead of next door for her first appointment with Dr. Monnier, a psychiatrist. Before the bemused Farber can straighten things out, Anna begins to unburden herself candidly, as if she's been on the couch for years. ""I have an urgent problem,"" says she. Then, confessing that her marriage is on the rocks, her husband unemployed and impotent - he hasn't touched her in six months - she begins to cry. William is stunned, moved by her tears, but before he can respond she is out the door. Fast exit, no payment. Everyone knows that the fee is part of therapy.Faber's life is bland. He lives in the flat where he was born, never having moved or really traveled. He inherited his father's business and many of the old clients. Used to an orderly existence, he lives alone and usually takes dinner by himself, with a glass of wine, while listening to music. Occasionally, through the window, he catches glimpses of couples, other lives. Jeanne, his last and perhaps only love, (Anne Brochet of the wonderful smile), left him for another man but they get together occasionally and maintain a close friendship. He is decidedly intrigued by Anna's visit but does not expect a repeat performance.He is fascinated after visit number 2, when he finally manages to blurt out, ""I'm not a doctor."" Anna responds quickly, that she knows many therapists are not doctors and that's fine by her. Again, she leaves quickly. William is the one to visit Dr. Monnier, the shrink, (Michel Duchaussoy), who tells him that this situation is about his own problems and not Anna's. He also explains that accounting and psychiatry are not that different because, ""they both decide what to hide and what to reveal.""As Anna and William's sessions continue and become more intimate and graphic, William is clearly aroused, almost titillated at times. He obviously begins to develop feelings for this confused, attractive woman, who says she wants nothing more than to regain her husband's affections. Yet, the two are deeply drawn to each other, their role playing is a way to form a bond without emotional risk. They are both odd, but sympathetic characters. William had dreams of adventure once, when younger, however he has become entrenched, staid, with middle age. A sensitive but repressed man, he has not lived life to the fullest. He is captivated by the graceful, unpredictable Anna. And she is intense, mysterious, vulnerable, and one gets a sense that no one has ever bothered to listen to her before. But can she be trusted?Anna eventually learns Farber's true identity as a financial planner - just when he was making such progress as a therapist too. The plot takes a further twist when Marc, Anna's creepy husband, enters the picture which adds another touch of Hitchcock to the mix. The movie does succeed in becoming a low-keyed, but taut thriller. William's secretary, Madame Mulon, (Helene Surgere), adds a light touch as she tries to discover what on earth is going on behind the closed doors of her employer's office.Patrice Leconte is an excellent director. He has a knack for developing characters, and here he has two superb actors to work with. The brooding musical score is atmospheric and serves to add tension. One of the film's major themes is expressed clearly by Dr. Monnier who says, ""Listening is a lost art in our times: not even barbers, beauticians, or bartenders seem to have the knack or the patience anymore to attend to others in this way.""  I was deeply touched by ""Intimate Strangers."" It is an elusive piece, romantic, Freudian in a good sense, with a wonderful conclusion.

She divulges intimate details of her falling apart marriage in a few minutes and leaves.  Very noir!  This continues for weeks.  Does the accountant reveal he is not a therapist?  Is he going too far?  Is she going too far?When all is said and done, this terribly laborious Patrice Leconte film has little payoff.

863586,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B00068S3QO,M. Burns,"[0, 0]","Much like Kurosawa for Japanese cinema and Ingmar Bergman for Swedish films, the entire onslaught of the 1960's New Wave has set a stereotype for our perception (and expectations) of French movies. We hear ""Japanese movie"" and Toshiro Mifune comes charging forth - sword in hand - in a mental image; someone says ""Swedish film"" and there's Gunnar Bjorstrand staring out at a wintery landscape mourning the absence of God; the words ""French movie"" arise and thoughts of lengthy dialogue and mildly pretentious camerawork form in our heads. I'd like to say that Patrice Leconte's astutely written Intimate Strangers breaks free from what the average filmgoer thinks of les films francaises, but that would be somewhat of a fib. Then again, Leconte (who made last year's fantastic Man on the Train) is good at what he does, no matter how stereotypically ""French"" it may outwardly seem.The plot of Strangers is a sociologist's wet dream: a beautiful (but deeply disturbed) woman mistakenly walks into a tax attorney's office thinking he's a therapist, she starts telling him all her deep secrets, he's too enthralled to tell her the truth. Leconte and master cinematographer Eduardo Serra (Girl with a Pearl Earring) keep things low-key but mysterious for a while, everything heightened by Sandrine Bonnaire's delicate performance as Anna and Serra's narrow-focused hand-held camera. The atmosphere of the movie almost feels like that tax attorney's office: claustrophobic and secretive. Suddenly, though, we learn something that changes the entire dynamic of the relationship of Anna and tax attorney William (Fabrice Luchini), and the movie begins to branch out a bit. In come wry comic moments, new characters that may or may not be crucial, and - yes - more and more secrets about the sexy Anna. Ever so slowly, Intimate Strangers becomes less and less a social/moral dilemma and more an intricate little character study.Which is both a strength and a weakness. Thing is, as interesting as the developments of the film may be, Strangers remains a little too tidy and a little too reigned-in for its own good. Leconte, who enriched Man on the Train with playful humor and a wonderful tear-jerker of a finale, seems content to just play it safe all the time here. Luckily, though, leads Bonnaire and Luchini don't suffer the movie's technical shortcomings at all. Luchini has a wan, faintly comical face that lends William some great little farcical moments that wouldn't work on anyone else. Bonnaire is a marvel of understatement, rendering a complicated woman accessible and intriguing without hysterics or melodrama. In short, this very odd couple makes Strangers worth it. In a general sense, this is a well-crafted-but-haughty French drama that satisfies without being moving or affecting. Pared down to Anna and William spilling secrets in a shadowy office, it's an actor's showcase. And that's never a bad thing.

Anna talks pretty much non-stop about her marriage, her brutish husband, and her lack of sex life. Then stops, gets up and leaves: having embarrassed herself by her ramblings. There is a problem though: Anna thinks that William is her new therapist and William, seemingly so fascinated with Anna that he says nothing to the contrary even going so far as to schedule another appointment for the following week.Director Patrice Leconte has plowed this territory before especially in his ""Man on the Train"" and the ruse succeeds for as long as it needs to as William comes clean to Anna early on in the film.

But as she blossoms from the benefits of her ""analysis,"" her makeup, hair, clothing becomes lighter and more revealing: obvious but effective. William also changes and there is one odd though funny scene of him dancing solo a la Tom Cruise in ""Risky Business"" to Otis Redding's ""Try a Little Tenderness"" that has to be seen to be believed.""Intimate Strangers"" is a strange little movie that expects a lot from its viewers but just manages to stay on our good side by treating us like we have some intelligence and taste.

Anna (Sandrine Bonnaire) seeks the help of a psychiatrist in dealing with her marital problems, but mistakenly arrives at the office of a tax attorney down the hall instead. The attorney, William (Fabrice Luchini), at first thinks she is a new client seeking financial advice concerning a divorce. When he realizes that Anna wanted the office of M. Monnier, the psychiatrist, he is too intrigued to correct her. She eventually discovers her error, but continues to tell her troubles to William. The more she explains, the less he understands, and so he ends up consulting the psychiatrist Monnier (Michel Duchaussoy).""Intimate Strangers"" succeeds in making the audience curious to understand Anna's situation and motives. We're intrigued, as William is, and this holds our attention for most of the film. But ""Intimate Strangers"" suffers from an utter lack of credibility and pervasive Freudian clich&eacute;s. Anna is a fantasy. She does what a lonely, aging, cloistered man might fantasize that a younger woman who confides in him would do. She doesn't act realistically. People are given to act oddly and unpredictably, of course, but not in accordance with others' desires. The ending of the film is especially unbelievable. Director Patrice Leconte draws attention to the camera by shaking it at the worst moments, which only diminishes his characters.

I was slightly disappointed by the movie, but Brochet did a very fine job(I only wish that she had a bigger part here). I think the biggest drawback of the movie is that the conversations (or the lack of it) between the two main characters did not live up to its astoundingly clever opening plot. I can accept their first two meetings being cut short because of the circumstances of their meeting, but the subsequent ones continued to be terse and abrupt. There's just not enough material to support the improbable premise. The director scramble to prop up the main storyline with subplots and characters (William's secretary, his last girlfriend, the real shrink). While they're all quite interesting and fit well into the plot, but I thought it was really the last straw when Ana's husband showed up at William's office.

863595,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00068S3QO,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","Patrice Leconte is one of my favorite directors, but first time round I found Confidences Trop Intimes little more than a pleasant but disposable diversion despite the promise held by his reunion with his Monsieur Hire star Sandrine Bonnaire. Surprisingly, although slightly disappointing on a first viewing, I found it held up remarkably well on a second viewing.In some ways a sly reversal of Last Tango, in which two characters meet to talk rather than to screw, the limitations I noticed first time round still hold true: it's more a conceit than a movie, a character piece that never goes anywhere much but holds the interest. Bonnaire, previously not a favorite actress of mine, is increasingly impressive in a superb performance that really does evolve throughout the course of the film, easily outclassing Fabrice Lucini. Always a rather one-note actor, Lucini is at his best here, but the fact that his character is incapable of growth - even the final move is more a change of surroundings than of character and can actually be viewed as a retrograde step - makes him more of a sounding board for Bonnaire than a real focus for the film. Coming across as a somber Eric Idle cross-pollinated with a hesitant Jean-Louis Trintignant, we know everything about him very early in the film, and he is never quite drawn out of his shell enough to ever become genuinely interesting in his own right.Despite the claustrophobic settings, Leconte never fails to make the film cinematic, his mastery of the Scope frame making what could have just been a chamber piece into a surprisingly rich experience. In many ways he's like Sidney Lumet in his prime in his ability to find a way of making two characters sitting down and talking to each other more cinematic than most directors can make a street scene. Unfortunately, it doesn't amount to much by the time the end credits are rolling.

It is about the nature of loving and being loved, seen through an ordinary financial advisor William (Fabrice Luchini).When Anna (Sandrine Bonnaire) enters the office of a tax layer William by mistake, thinking that he is the therapist she was supposed to meet that day, William, utterly bemused at first, fails to reveal who he really is. Uptight William knows he should have told the truth, but Anna and her confessional story are too seductive for him to stop, or perhaps for any males.It doesn't take much time for Anna to discover her mistake, but even so, she regularly comes to the office of William, who is intrigued by her. But why does she keep coming and talking about her life before a stranger? And what is the real story behind the sexually charged words of Anna, whose real life and personality are going to be tantalizingly suggested through the eye of William.[HIGHLY NUANCED] It is certain that `Intimate Stranger' contains such elements as following and love affair; one of the characters may use threatening words, or you may be surprised at several twists of the story, but the film best works as romance, or a bit unusual kind of love story about a man and a woman. It is also impressive as off-beat comedy especially when we notice the rich details of the characters including the real psychiatrist Dr. Monnier (expertly done by Michel Duchaussoy), who gives precious tips to William, but not without some prices.`Intimate Stranger' also offers insightful views on the role of psychiatrist with the portraits of William and Anna - for example, ""What does it mean to listen to a stranger's confession by profession?"" -- but `Intimate Stranger' is most impressive when it shows the power game between William and Anna. You don't see passionate love scenes, not even hugging or kissing, but you can see the passion in the words and faces of Anna and William. It is downplayed, but it is there.This is not the best of Patrice Leconte, who did a similar thing in a less talky and more effective way in more sensual `The Girl on the Bridge,' but `Intimate Stranger' is still a very good showcase for the director's ability to present the intricate and intriguing relations between the characters.",4,Someone Knocking on the Wrong Door; Unique Love Story Highly Nuanced,1159315200,"09 27, 2006",2006,2387,"['Patrice', 'Leconte', 'Intimate', 'Stranger', 'starts', 'Hitchcock-like', 'mystery', 'soon', 'will', 'realize', 'film', 'real', 'mystery', 'not', 'diamond', 'theft', 'murder', 'plot', 'nature', 'loving', 'being', 'loved', 'seen', 'ordinary', 'financial', 'advisor', 'William', 'Fabrice', 'Luchini', '.When', 'Anna', 'Sandrine', 'Bonnaire', 'office', 'tax', 'layer', 'William', 'mistake', 'thinking', 'therapist', 'was', 'supposed', 'meet', 'day', 'William', 'utterly', 'bemused', 'first', 'reveal', 'who', 'really', 'Uptight', 'William', 'should', 'have', 'told', 'truth', 'Anna', 'confessional', 'story', 'are', 'too', 'seductive', 'stop', 'perhaps', 'males.It', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'time', 'Anna', 'discover', 'mistake', 'even', 'so', 'regularly', 'office', 'William', 'who', 'intrigued', 'why', 'keep', 'coming', 'talking', 'life', 'stranger', 'what', 'real', 'story', 'sexually', 'charged', 'words', 'Anna', 'real', 'life', 'personality', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'tantalizingly', 'suggested', 'eye', 'William', '[', 'HIGHLY', 'NUANCED', 'certain', 'Intimate', 'Stranger', 'contains', 'such', 'elements', 'following', 'love', 'affair', 'one', 'characters', 'may', 'use', 'threatening', 'words', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'several', 'twists', 'story', 'film', 'best', 'works', 'romance', 'bit', 'unusual', 'kind', 'love', 'story', 'man', 'woman', 'also', 'impressive', 'off-beat', 'comedy', 'especially', 'when', 'notice', 'rich', 'details', 'characters', 'including', 'real', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Monnier', 'expertly', 'done', 'Michel', 'Duchaussoy', 'who', 'precious', 'tips', 'William', 'not', 'prices.', 'Intimate', 'Stranger', 'also', 'insightful', 'views', 'role', 'psychiatrist', 'portraits', 'William', 'Anna', 'example', 'What', 'mean', 'listen', 'stranger', 'confession', 'profession', 'Intimate', 'Stranger', 'most', 'impressive', 'when', 'power', 'game', 'William', 'Anna', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'passionate', 'love', 'scenes', 'not', 'even', 'hugging', 'kissing', 'can', 'see', 'passion', 'words', 'Anna', 'William', 'downplayed', 'there.This', 'not', 'best', 'Patrice', 'Leconte', 'who', 'did', 'similar', 'thing', 'less', 'talky', 'more', 'effective', 'way', 'more', 'sensual', 'Girl', 'Bridge', 'Intimate', 'Stranger', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'showcase', 'director', 'ability', 'present', 'intricate', 'intriguing', 'relations', 'characters']",N/A
