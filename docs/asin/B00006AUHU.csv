710273,A11YV6VC51HJTV,B00006AUHU,"Blake Petit ""Novelist, columnist & reviewer""","[25, 26]","If there's any complaint to be made about the Best of the Muppet Show DVDs, it's that they really could give you more than three episodes per disc. You feel a little like you're getting gouged. However, the stuff you get is great.Specific to this disc, you've got three of the best episodes of the Muppet Show. The Mark Hamill episode looks like everybody on that set was having a sheer blast. Hamill plays himself AND Luke Skywalker, and C-3PO, RD-2D and Chewbacca all join him. Paul Simon is as good as always (and he hold the distinction of being the only Muppet guest to ever compose all of the music for his episode) and Raquel Welch's duet with Miss Piggy is a classic.As for the series as a whole, you get some great extras. Brian Henson provides an introduction to each episode, spilling a little info (hence the Paul Simon tidbit above). You also get production sketches and new Muppet shorts (at least, I've never seen `em before) at about two per disc. Each disc has one ""Muppet Screen Test,"" in which the Muppets do TV and movie parodies, and one ""Muppetism,"" which is the TV equivalent of those posters with a kitten dangling from a clothesline that read ""Hang in there!"" Silly, upbeat messages presented in a cute manner.Like I said, the discs are a little pricey for what you get, but it's worth it for the hardcore Muppet fan.

It is no exaggeration to say that this was the best TV ever produced, chock-full of humor and inspiration.Each episode consists of a series of muppet skits, tied together with a weekly celebrity guest-host. In addition to Mark Hamill (mentioned in the title), this DVD contains episodes hosted by Paul Simon and Raquel Welch.Before the release of this DVD series, the shows were available only from Time/Life, under a monthly-subscription-type arrangement or as boxed sets (at premium prices).

I was mostly looking forward to the one with Mark Hamill and found it was really stupid. Now I know why he never went beyond Star Wars (and as a fan of that trilogy that's saying something). However, the episode with Paul Simon was wonderful! Their rendition of Scarborough Fair was hilarious!

When I put this DVD in my player, I become 6 years old again.I can see my parents next to me on our old couch, telling me I can stay up to watch the Muppets, and then it'll be time for bed. (Mommy's grown-up Muppets, my mother used to say, as opposed to the ones on Sesame Street.)  And I watched, with joy but also a slight sense of dread, as each skit would bring me that much closer to the end of the show, and to bedtime.I settled into the couch, and then, suddenly -- CRASH!  What was that?  Luke Skywalker!  C-3PO! R2-D2!  The Star Wars guys were on the Muppet Show!  I could barely handle the sheer coolness of it all.Watching the same episode on DVD now, of course, different things stand out.  How lousy Mark Hamill is as an actor.  His 70's argyle-sweater-vest style.  The pathetic sight of Chewbacca and R2-D2 being made to dance, once a cause for childish glee, now seems a spectre of the slow decline of the Star Wars franchise.On another level, it occurred to me that the Muppet Show, taking place in the pre-MTV era, was really the forerunner of the music video.  Each episode presents at least 3 or 4 songs with some sort of visual interpretation of the music.  If there's a difference, it's that the Muppet Show lacks the hyperactive editing style of today's videos, so you can actually focus on what's going on -- you're not barraged by disjointed stimuli.  It's almost quaint.  The gentleness of the songs also struck me as a sign of an era that has passed us by.  Would there be a place for the Muppets on television today?  Who would the guest stars be?  Eminem? 50 Cent?  Lil' Kim?But enough of such worries.  I'm watching Luke Skywalker and the Muppets, and it's just too amazing for my six-year-old brain to process.  I wriggle my toes inside my Cookie Monster pajamas with the feet on them, and as Zoot blows that last, sorrowful note into his saxaphone, the credits roll up the screen, and I know it's time for bed.  But I'm not even tired!

710277,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00006AUHU,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[5, 6]","Like many in my generation, I grew up with the Muppets. Not only were they on Sesame Street when I was a wee lad, but they also had there own show, THE MUPPET SHOW. This hilarious comedy variety show was set in a theatre that the Muppets performed a &quot;live&quot; show upon each week. It was something so new and unique that it took Jim Henson several years before his idea finally made it to the airwaves. And when it finally did, the Muppets became a huge hit. America hadn't seen anything like it. Each episode featured a guest star or stars who interacted with the Muppets in various songs, sketches, and musical numbers. Intertwined were backstage antics and two old guys in the balcony commenting on the comedy below. It was a show that had something for the entire family and had humor on several different levels. In THE MUPPET SHOW, America rediscovered wit.Now, for the first time some of the best episodes of THE MUPPET SHOW are available on DVD. This DVD includes episodes with Mark Hamill and the Stars of STAR WARS, Paul Simon, and Raquel Welch. The Mark Hamill episode also has C-3P0, R2-D2, and Chewbacca and ends with a song and dance routine that parodies the Walt Disney Company. All of the music on the Paul Simon episode are songs written by Simon, and the episode with Raquel Welch, Welch begins the show dancing with a giant spider and ends it singing a duet with Miss Piggy.There really aren't any extras here. Just a few Muppet educational type promos and a fact about the Muppet whom Mark Hamill replaced. This is a great DVD to watch over and over and I can honestly say, you won't grow tired of watching it.",5,Return of the Muppets.,1032652800,"09 22, 2002",2002,1638,"['many', 'generation', 'grew', 'up', 'Muppets', 'Not', 'only', 'were', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'when', 'was', 'wee', 'lad', 'also', 'had', 'own', 'show', 'MUPPET', 'SHOW', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'variety', 'show', 'was', 'set', 'theatre', 'Muppets', 'performed', 'quot', 'quot', 'week', 'was', 'something', 'so', 'new', 'unique', 'took', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'several', 'years', 'idea', 'finally', 'made', 'airwaves', 'when', 'finally', 'did', 'Muppets', 'became', 'huge', 'hit', 'America', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'episode', 'featured', 'guest', 'star', 'stars', 'who', 'interacted', 'Muppets', 'various', 'songs', 'sketches', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Intertwined', 'were', 'backstage', 'antics', 'two', 'old', 'guys', 'balcony', 'commenting', 'comedy', 'was', 'show', 'had', 'something', 'entire', 'family', 'had', 'humor', 'several', 'different', 'levels', 'MUPPET', 'SHOW', 'America', 'rediscovered', 'wit.Now', 'first', 'time', 'best', 'episodes', 'THE', 'MUPPET', 'SHOW', 'are', 'available', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'Stars', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'episode', 'also', 'C-3P0', 'R2-D2', 'Chewbacca', 'song', 'dance', 'routine', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Company', 'music', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'episode', 'are', 'songs', 'written', 'Simon', 'episode', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'Welch', 'show', 'dancing', 'giant', 'spider', 'singing', 'duet', 'Miss', 'Piggy.There', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'extras', 'here', 'Just', 'few', 'Muppet', 'educational', 'type', 'promos', 'fact', 'Muppet', 'whom', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'replaced', 'great', 'DVD', 'watch', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'grow', 'tired', 'watching']",Best of the Muppet Show: Volume 2
