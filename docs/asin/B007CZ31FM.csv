Ok, so the movie had zombies but this story wasn't quite suited for zombies.

1529959,A3Q86A7D87AL6L,B007CZ31FM,Douglas Lewis,"[0, 0]","Well. How can you describe this one? That's kind of hard. The first thing that comes to mind is ""Hey, what kind of zombie movie do you think Andy Warhol would have made if Troma had hired him to make one?"" If you even understand that at all, then you've kind of got an idea of what to expect. This is pretty much an arthouse style flick. It follows the journey of a lone little girl in a post-apocalyptic wasteland while paralleling this story to the story of how the little girl ended up away from her mother. In this future, the air is not breathable except by a certain few children who have been born with strange cuts on their neck that will not heal. All adults and otherwise turn into zombies when they breath the air. Oh yeah - the zombies don't bother the little kids so that is kind of a main thing. At first the pseudo-military adult element is trying to do experiments on the kids, then it seems like they are more bent on just hunting them down and killing them (?) The music is mostly piano or post-rock build up, so it is fairly effective when not a bit overblown and nagging. Fairly effective use of color and filter-style to convey when we are in flashbacks, current time, and just making some neat transitions. Though the washed-out bleach bypass image style used throughout most of the movie does get a bit tedious to look at after awhile. The cinematography is strongly above average for the budget and I found myself more entertained by this than the actual story, which is somewhat thinly spread. To be honest, this might have been more effective as a short film, though it still only comes in at around an hour long. The ending, and i mean literally the last 30 seconds to a minute of the movie, are totally confusing. It just turns out the movie isn't about what you thought it was about the whole time, but not in a ""oh what a twist! Niiiiice!"" kind of way ... more of a ""WTF was that?!?!"" kind of way. I'll admit, I had a funny look at my face and literally scratched my head at the ending. I promise you'll do the same. So, considering the budget and artistic goals of the film, I'll give it an above average rating on my zombie scale. Its worth watching if you're into this kind of thing - if you're not, then you'll most certainly hate it.",3,Hmmm... its kind of interesting,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,2268,"['Well', 'How', 'can', 'describe', 'one', 'kind', 'hard', 'first', 'thing', 'mind', 'Hey', 'what', 'kind', 'zombie', 'movie', 'do', 'think', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Troma', 'had', 'hired', 'make', 'one', 'even', 'understand', 'then', ""'ve"", 'kind', 'got', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'pretty', 'much', 'arthouse', 'style', 'flick', 'journey', 'lone', 'little', 'girl', 'post-apocalyptic', 'wasteland', 'paralleling', 'story', 'story', 'how', 'little', 'girl', 'ended', 'up', 'away', 'mother', 'future', 'air', 'not', 'breathable', 'certain', 'few', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'strange', 'cuts', 'neck', 'will', 'not', 'heal', 'adults', 'otherwise', 'turn', 'zombies', 'when', 'breath', 'air', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'little', 'kids', 'kind', 'main', 'thing', 'first', 'pseudo-military', 'adult', 'element', 'trying', 'do', 'experiments', 'kids', 'then', 'are', 'more', 'bent', 'just', 'hunting', 'down', 'killing', 'music', 'mostly', 'piano', 'post-rock', 'build', 'up', 'fairly', 'effective', 'when', 'not', 'bit', 'overblown', 'nagging', 'Fairly', 'effective', 'use', 'color', 'filter-style', 'convey', 'when', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'current', 'time', 'just', 'making', 'neat', 'transitions', 'washed-out', 'bleach', 'bypass', 'image', 'style', 'used', 'most', 'movie', 'get', 'bit', 'tedious', 'look', 'awhile', 'cinematography', 'strongly', 'above', 'average', 'budget', 'found', 'more', 'entertained', 'actual', 'story', 'somewhat', 'thinly', 'spread', 'be', 'honest', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'short', 'film', 'still', 'only', 'hour', 'long', 'ending', 'i', 'mean', 'literally', 'last', '30', 'seconds', 'minute', 'movie', 'are', 'totally', 'confusing', 'just', 'out', 'movie', ""n't"", 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'whole', 'time', 'not', 'oh', 'what', 'twist', 'Niiiiice', 'kind', 'way', 'more', 'WTF', 'was', 'kind', 'way', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'had', 'funny', 'look', 'face', 'literally', 'scratched', 'head', 'ending', 'promise', ""'ll"", 'do', 'same', 'So', 'considering', 'budget', 'artistic', 'goals', 'film', ""'ll"", 'give', 'above', 'average', 'rating', 'zombie', 'scale', 'worth', 'watching', ""'re"", 'kind', 'thing', ""'re"", 'not', 'then', ""'ll"", 'most', 'certainly', 'hate']",Descendents
1529960,AMY5FH3WYKZQT,B007CZ31FM,"Lika Laruku ""likalaruku""","[0, 0]","Going into this movie, you have to ask yourself if you can look past the the horrible camera filters, shaky cam, bad CG effects, half-assed acting, slow pace, filler in the form of continuous flashbacks of the same scenes over & over again, & a WTF ending to enjoy a unique zombie apocalypse told from a child's perspective, where zombies are passive, & living soldiers are the bad guys. Having already sat through Birdemic, Pot Zombies, The Amazing Bulk, & Pulse 2, I was prepared & hoped for so-bad-it's-good.The world has gone to hell & no one can expect any kind of basic human rights from those in power. The living scientists & soldiers seem to be a bigger threat to the living than the zombies, tearing apart families & killing indiscriminately. The children are immune, so scientists forcibly separate them from their parents & strap them to chairs, hoping to find a cure, but for unexplained reasons, soldiers are very eager to kill these children without hesitation.An annoying oddity is that even though the infected mother tells the girl that zombies won't harm the immune, she insists that the girl run away from her & not come near. This scene is the most overplayed flashback, so the mother's break in logic here is really hammered into your head.In the opening narration, the girl basically tells you how the movie is going to end; it's so absurd that you immediately put it out of your mind until it actually happens, & there is no explanation for for it at all.In the end, it was terrible, but you should still see it once if you enjoy a good train wreck. I think with a higher budget, more experienced cast, some rewriting, & a different ending, this could be remade into a decent movie.",3,"So bad, yet I can't bring myself to hate it.",1383609600,"11 5, 2013",2013,1706,"['Going', 'movie', 'have', 'ask', 'can', 'look', 'horrible', 'camera', 'filters', 'shaky', 'cam', 'bad', 'CG', 'effects', 'half-assed', 'acting', 'slow', 'pace', 'filler', 'form', 'continuous', 'flashbacks', 'same', 'scenes', 'over', 'again', 'WTF', 'ending', 'enjoy', 'unique', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'told', 'child', 'perspective', 'where', 'zombies', 'are', 'passive', 'living', 'soldiers', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'Having', 'already', 'sat', 'Birdemic', 'Pot', 'Zombies', 'Amazing', 'Bulk', 'Pulse', '2', 'was', 'prepared', 'hoped', ""so-bad-it's-good.The"", 'world', 'gone', 'hell', 'one', 'can', 'expect', 'kind', 'basic', 'human', 'rights', 'power', 'living', 'scientists', 'soldiers', 'seem', 'be', 'bigger', 'threat', 'living', 'zombies', 'tearing', 'apart', 'families', 'killing', 'indiscriminately', 'children', 'are', 'immune', 'so', 'scientists', 'forcibly', 'separate', 'parents', 'strap', 'chairs', 'hoping', 'find', 'cure', 'unexplained', 'reasons', 'soldiers', 'are', 'very', 'eager', 'kill', 'children', 'hesitation.An', 'annoying', 'oddity', 'even', 'infected', 'mother', 'girl', 'zombies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'harm', 'immune', 'girl', 'run', 'away', 'not', 'come', 'near', 'scene', 'most', 'overplayed', 'flashback', 'mother', 'break', 'logic', 'here', 'really', 'hammered', 'opening', 'narration', 'girl', 'basically', 'how', 'movie', 'going', 'end', 'so', 'absurd', 'immediately', 'put', 'mind', 'actually', 'explanation', 'end', 'was', 'terrible', 'should', 'still', 'see', 'once', 'enjoy', 'good', 'train', 'wreck', 'think', 'higher', 'budget', 'more', 'experienced', 'cast', 'rewriting', 'different', 'ending', 'could', 'be', 'remade', 'decent', 'movie']",Descendents
1529961,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B007CZ31FM,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","I love horror movies. I love bad horror movies and I love good horror movies. Being a George Romero fan I love zombie movies too. But when a zombie movie goes bad it goes really bad. That happens with this film.In the future a virus has killed most everyone turning them into blood seeking zombies. But a few survivors have had children that have a natural immunity to the disease. Not only that, the zombies don't attack or attempt to eat these children. With three bloody lines across their necks, you know exactly what is coming. Hello? Gills anyone?The story is told by a young girl as she treks her way to the sea where her dreams have told her to go in search of a giant octopus and a ship that will take these children away. Spoiler alert if you care: yes, they reach their destination and they then change.It doesn't make a difference if I told you the outcome of this movie or not. Having to sit through it was torture that even being eaten alive would have possibly been better experiencing. The film takes the zombie motif and tries to turn it into an art film. Ho hum. The worst sin a horror movie can make is to be boring. This film does that in spades.  Let me just say that a second viewing of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE would be more entertaining than this film.

1529962,A16XRPF40679KG,B007CZ31FM,Michael Dobey,"[0, 0]","It's easy to rate this a two or one star affair. Lets be honest most very low budget  horror movies are one or two star at most compared to most other flicks. But if you love horror movies and low budget ones shouldn't they have their own rating system? It's only fair. So on a VERY low budget this one does some impressive work. The lead actress is a little girl and she's quite good and should have a future in film. Hopefully without getting involved in dope etc later on. She carries the flick as she wanders around , the cgi is very impressive in this flick. It's amazing what can be done these days even with a very small budget. The cities look very realistic and ruined. The helicopters look real too at least until the end shot. The film however did grate on me with it's constant flash back to the little girl and her mother escaping a research station. Frankly it's better just to do ONE flashback. Few films can get away with one than one flashback of the same  past event. It's distracting and it doesn't work. the story is limited but engaging as the little girl and other kids try to stay alive. In this one , the infected don't hunt them it's soldiers who do. The ending is well strange and surreal and sorta blows the whole movie but until then it was ok. This is really a two star flick on a normal scale but this tried to be different and it's ok. The infected utilize very limited makeup because they aren't zombies really because they are still alive.  SO if you enjoy a VERY low budget horror film that is a little different then you might enjoy this. Or you may not, if you are not a fan of low budget horror then this aint for you. This was shot in chile and they speak english in this movie because english is the worlds language, the film though doesn't take place in chile , it's taking place in a unnamed place. There is a documentary extra which shows how even with little money you can make digital images appear filmlike in postproduction.  when even this low of budget can do that , then you can see why film will start vanishing probably.",3,impressive cgi strange movie. 3 stars on a low budget scale.,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,2071,"['easy', 'rate', 'two', 'one', 'star', 'affair', 'be', 'honest', 'most', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'star', 'most', 'compared', 'most', 'other', 'flicks', 'love', 'horror', 'movies', 'low', 'budget', 'ones', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'own', 'rating', 'system', 'only', 'fair', 'So', 'VERY', 'low', 'budget', 'one', 'impressive', 'work', 'lead', 'actress', 'little', 'girl', 'quite', 'good', 'should', 'have', 'future', 'film', 'Hopefully', 'getting', 'involved', 'dope', 'etc', 'later', 'flick', 'around', 'cgi', 'very', 'impressive', 'flick', 'amazing', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'days', 'even', 'very', 'small', 'budget', 'cities', 'look', 'very', 'realistic', 'ruined', 'helicopters', 'look', 'real', 'too', 'least', 'end', 'shot', 'film', 'however', 'did', 'grate', 'constant', 'flash', 'back', 'little', 'girl', 'mother', 'escaping', 'research', 'station', 'Frankly', 'better', 'just', 'do', 'ONE', 'flashback', 'Few', 'films', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'one', 'one', 'flashback', 'same', 'past', 'event', 'distracting', ""n't"", 'work', 'story', 'limited', 'engaging', 'little', 'girl', 'other', 'kids', 'try', 'stay', 'alive', 'one', 'infected', 'do', ""n't"", 'hunt', 'soldiers', 'who', 'do', 'ending', 'well', 'strange', 'surreal', 'sorta', 'whole', 'movie', 'then', 'was', 'ok', 'really', 'two', 'star', 'flick', 'normal', 'scale', 'tried', 'be', 'different', 'ok', 'infected', 'utilize', 'very', 'limited', 'makeup', 'are', ""n't"", 'zombies', 'really', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'SO', 'enjoy', 'VERY', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'film', 'little', 'different', 'then', 'might', 'enjoy', 'may', 'not', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'then', 'aint', 'was', 'shot', 'chile', 'speak', 'english', 'movie', 'english', 'worlds', 'language', 'film', 'though', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'chile', 'taking', 'place', 'unnamed', 'place', 'documentary', 'extra', 'how', 'even', 'little', 'money', 'can', 'make', 'digital', 'images', 'appear', 'postproduction', 'when', 'even', 'low', 'budget', 'can', 'do', 'then', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'will', 'start', 'vanishing', 'probably']",Descendents

I do however think the pitch meeting went like this : So you want to make a zombie movie with very little talking, or plot. Just a little girl walking and watching people get eaten until she finds water. Is that right? Yes that is correct. OK, here is 5 million dollars...have fun.
