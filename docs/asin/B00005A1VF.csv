This movie is unusual in two aspects.First, the theme may not be politically correct then - the reflection of a soldier amid battles of combat. Yet it echoes well with the present sentiments about a war - whether or not it is worth fighting in the first place. Thus, this movie was different from the war movies made back in the 40s and 50s where courage and good cause come naturally. The movie would have been much better received if it was to be released now.Second, the cinematography is excellent and the combat scenes of the civil war in the open land are well captured. Apart from a brief appearance of a young woman as the Army marched past the civilians' residence, the movie showed only the soldiers and the not so advanced machinery. John Huston's fingerprints were all over the film with his signature portrayal of someone ordinary caught in the middle of something big (like Humphery Bogart in African Queen) The movie reveals the vulnerability of human beings and that courage develops over time.

Russell ""syzygy121""","[6, 12]","Is this a post-WWII patriotic vehicle or is it a true adaptation of Crane's powerful and ground-breaking story?The story is NOT about heroism.  Frankly, I was surprised to see this film was made so soon after WWII and right at the beginning of the Korean War.  Crane's novel is one of the great anti-war pieces ever written, ranking with ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""  So is this film to be likened to ""Apocalypse Now"" or more like ""The Green Berets""?  Sadly, I fear the latter, if the spin on the trailer is accurate.  Comparing it to ""Birth of a Nation"" would suggest that it is thought of as a patriotic vehicle rather than a message film.  I thought maybe John Huston himself had the courage to film this story the way Crane intended it, but of course it is up to the viewer to ""get it"" or not.Crane's work is a naturalistic rendering of the inhumanity of war.  It is not about becoming a hero -- it is about a soldier who begins as an isolated and fear-filled boy but through the horrors of war becomes part of the ""war machine.""  It is not about the glory of war; it is about the loss of humanity that war demands of its participants.  In the end, even after acts of ""bravery"" the soldier wants to go home and flee warfare altogether.It is ironic that Audie Murphy, one of the highest decorated soliders of WWII, is playing the young soldier.  I wonder how many WWII veterans watching this film related to the fear and the sense of inhumanity presented at the core of the story.But of course, the Civl War is held in a different context than WWII, perhaps rightly so.  The enemy here is quite different than Nazi troops, or is it?  Read or watch ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" if you want to explore that question further.The film itself is well-made.  Huston's direction is quite good, with some interesting camera angles and great cinematography.  The censored language is quaint now, but the overall feel is still one of comeraderie and some realism.  Newcomers Murphy and Mauldin both hold their own quite well.  It is great to see Andy Devine and even William Schallert in supporting roles.  As for the DVD, I would like to have seen more extras and more notes on the production itself -- were the actors just that or were they early re-enactors?Overall it works as a war movie, I just wonder which side of war this movie really is supporting.",4,Did they get it?,1066780800,"10 22, 2003",2003,2360,"['post-WWII', 'patriotic', 'vehicle', 'true', 'adaptation', 'Crane', 'powerful', 'ground-breaking', 'story', 'story', 'NOT', 'heroism', 'Frankly', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'so', 'soon', 'WWII', 'right', 'beginning', 'Korean', 'War', 'Crane', 'novel', 'one', 'great', 'anti-war', 'pieces', 'ever', 'written', 'ranking', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'So', 'film', 'be', 'likened', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'more', 'Green', 'Berets', 'Sadly', 'fear', 'latter', 'spin', 'trailer', 'accurate', 'Comparing', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'would', 'suggest', 'thought', 'patriotic', 'vehicle', 'rather', 'message', 'film', 'thought', 'maybe', 'John', 'Huston', 'had', 'courage', 'film', 'story', 'way', 'Crane', 'intended', 'course', 'viewer', 'get', 'not.Crane', 'work', 'naturalistic', 'rendering', 'inhumanity', 'war', 'not', 'becoming', 'hero', 'soldier', 'who', 'isolated', 'fear-filled', 'boy', 'horrors', 'war', 'becomes', 'part', 'war', 'machine', 'not', 'glory', 'war', 'loss', 'humanity', 'war', 'demands', 'participants', 'end', 'even', 'acts', 'bravery', 'soldier', 'go', 'home', 'flee', 'warfare', 'altogether.It', 'ironic', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'one', 'highest', 'decorated', 'soliders', 'WWII', 'playing', 'young', 'soldier', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'WWII', 'veterans', 'watching', 'film', 'related', 'fear', 'sense', 'inhumanity', 'presented', 'core', 'story.But', 'course', 'Civl', 'War', 'held', 'different', 'context', 'WWII', 'perhaps', 'rightly', 'so', 'enemy', 'here', 'quite', 'different', 'Nazi', 'troops', 'watch', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'want', 'explore', 'question', 'further.The', 'film', 'well-made', 'Huston', 'direction', 'quite', 'good', 'interesting', 'camera', 'angles', 'great', 'cinematography', 'censored', 'language', 'quaint', 'now', 'overall', 'feel', 'still', 'one', 'comeraderie', 'realism', 'Newcomers', 'Murphy', 'Mauldin', 'hold', 'own', 'quite', 'well', 'great', 'see', 'Andy', 'Devine', 'even', 'William', 'Schallert', 'supporting', 'roles', 'DVD', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'extras', 'more', 'notes', 'production', 'were', 'actors', 'just', 'were', 'early', 're-enactors', 'war', 'movie', 'just', 'wonder', 'side', 'war', 'movie', 'really', 'supporting']",The Red Badge of Courage VHS

The title Red Badge of Courage refers to the badge given soldiers who are wounded, what is called today, a purple heart. Henry Fleming is the youth who is deadly afraid, especially frightened of becoming a coward and running away during the battle. Ironically, he is played by Audie Murphy the most decorated hero of World War Two. The narration in the film is quotes from Crane's masterpiece, a book written when Crane was only twenty-two years old. His language is superb. Murphy plays his part superbly. Viewers can see the fear in his face and gestures. The direction of the film is excellent, as is the scenery, and the acting by the supporting cast.During the first attack by the confederate soldiers, the youth was firm. But then, during the second attack, when many of his fellow union soldiers turned and ran, he ran too. He ran around the periphery of the battle field and was hit on the head by another union soldier who was running away. He went back to his unit somewhat dazed, not knowing where else to go, and claimed that he had been fighting on the right flank, and that he was shot in the head. No one had seen him running, so no one knew that he had acted cowardly.The unit is ordered to attack, and the youth, without thinking, rushes to the front to fire at the enemy soldiers. Then when the flag bearer falls dead, the youth lays down his rifle, takes up the flag, rushes to the front, and leads the unit with shouts of encouragement. His unit wins the battle, people talk of the youth's heroism, he turns from a youth into a man; but, as it is in life, a general who was not anywhere near the youth during the battle, got all the credit.",5,A great movie of an outstanding book,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,1831,"['short', '69', 'minute', 'black', 'white', '1951', 'film', 'stars', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'John', 'Huston', 'film', 'youth', 'evolving', 'man', 'Spring', '1862', 'battles', 'Civil', 'War', 'title', 'Red', 'Badge', 'Courage', 'refers', 'badge', 'given', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'wounded', 'what', 'called', 'today', 'purple', 'heart', 'Henry', 'Fleming', 'youth', 'who', 'deadly', 'afraid', 'especially', 'frightened', 'becoming', 'coward', 'running', 'away', 'battle', 'Ironically', 'played', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'most', 'decorated', 'hero', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'narration', 'film', 'quotes', 'Crane', 'masterpiece', 'book', 'written', 'when', 'Crane', 'was', 'only', 'twenty-two', 'years', 'old', 'language', 'superb', 'Murphy', 'part', 'superbly', 'Viewers', 'can', 'see', 'fear', 'face', 'gestures', 'direction', 'film', 'excellent', 'scenery', 'acting', 'supporting', 'cast.During', 'first', 'attack', 'confederate', 'soldiers', 'youth', 'was', 'firm', 'then', 'second', 'attack', 'when', 'many', 'fellow', 'union', 'soldiers', 'turned', 'ran', 'ran', 'too', 'ran', 'periphery', 'battle', 'field', 'was', 'hit', 'head', 'union', 'soldier', 'who', 'was', 'running', 'away', 'went', 'back', 'unit', 'somewhat', 'dazed', 'not', 'knowing', 'where', 'else', 'go', 'claimed', 'had', 'been', 'fighting', 'right', 'flank', 'was', 'shot', 'head', 'one', 'had', 'seen', 'running', 'one', 'knew', 'had', 'acted', 'cowardly.The', 'unit', 'ordered', 'attack', 'youth', 'thinking', 'rushes', 'front', 'fire', 'enemy', 'soldiers', 'Then', 'when', 'flag', 'bearer', 'dead', 'youth', 'down', 'rifle', 'up', 'flag', 'rushes', 'front', 'unit', 'shouts', 'encouragement', 'unit', 'battle', 'people', 'talk', 'youth', 'heroism', 'youth', 'man', 'life', 'general', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'anywhere', 'youth', 'battle', 'got', 'credit']",The Red Badge of Courage VHS
576131,A140XH16IKR4B0,B00005A1VF,Jean E. Pouliot,"[1, 5]","Stephen Crane's ""Red Badge of Courage "" is a sublime psychological study of fear in the face of war, and the way one young man deals with fear -- through flight, bravado, exaggeration and finally, self-confrontation and calm determination. Though the action takes place in one of the most extroverted of possible historical settings -- the American Civil War -- the real warfare takes place in Fleming's psyche. Unfortunately, John Huston was not equal to the task of applying a visual narrative that could convincingly depict the roiling chaos going on in protagonist Henry Fleming's soul. About all he could manage was to put Henry in a few conventional situations and have him knit his brow and bite his lips to communicate his inner turmoil. Audie Murphy, the decorated WWII vet, and Bill Mauldin, the respected war cartoonist and creator of Willie and Joe, were cast in the lead roles. They are likeable and sometimes rise to the level of having a real relationship. But ultimately, their real-world experience doesn't do much to prop up the threadbare narrative. The stilted delivery and wooden acting of much of the cast is a real impediment to enjoying this film. On the plus side, it's daring to portray the baseless bravado and fear experienced by the ordinary soldier. But the profusion of standard Hollywood types, the overwrought and self-important narration, and the unnecessary re-arrangement of Crane's plot combine to muddle the story arc and render the film ineffective.Although it too suffers from the set piece mentality -- in which characters are pitted mechanically against one crisis after another -- Huston's next film, African Queen, stands out as such a classic. Reason: the sterling acting abilities of Bogart and Hepburn pulled the film through in a way that (sadly) Murphy, Mauldin and others cannot.The DVD extras are skimpy -- comprising the theatrical trailer and a static listing of the cast. But one extra is fascinating. After comparing RBOC to ""Gone with the Wind,"" (not!) the trailer makes the most lunkheaded claim I have ever seen in film. To paraphrase: ""In years to come, The Red Badge of Courage will be as memorable as The Birth of a Nation!"" Comparing one's work to a film that glorified the KKK is a feat so bizarre that it stands as a monument to the social blindness of the film's marketers and their era.Huston's ""Red Badge of Courage"" is disappointing, plodding and barely worthwhile as a way to visualize the events of the book. The best one can say about it is that it could have been worse. Until a better adaptation is produced, RBOC is a work that should be experienced in one form only: the printed page.",2,Demerits for the entire company,1183334400,"07 2, 2007",2007,2659,"['Stephen', 'Crane', 'Red', 'Badge', 'Courage', 'sublime', 'psychological', 'study', 'fear', 'face', 'war', 'way', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'deals', 'fear', 'flight', 'bravado', 'exaggeration', 'finally', 'self-confrontation', 'calm', 'determination', 'action', 'place', 'one', 'most', 'extroverted', 'possible', 'historical', 'settings', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'real', 'warfare', 'place', 'Fleming', 'psyche', 'Unfortunately', 'John', 'Huston', 'was', 'not', 'equal', 'task', 'applying', 'visual', 'narrative', 'could', 'convincingly', 'depict', 'roiling', 'chaos', 'going', 'protagonist', 'Henry', 'Fleming', 'soul', 'could', 'manage', 'was', 'put', 'Henry', 'few', 'conventional', 'situations', 'have', 'knit', 'brow', 'bite', 'lips', 'communicate', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'decorated', 'WWII', 'vet', 'Bill', 'Mauldin', 'respected', 'war', 'cartoonist', 'creator', 'Willie', 'Joe', 'were', 'cast', 'lead', 'roles', 'are', 'likeable', 'sometimes', 'rise', 'level', 'having', 'real', 'relationship', 'ultimately', 'real-world', 'experience', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'prop', 'up', 'threadbare', 'narrative', 'stilted', 'delivery', 'wooden', 'acting', 'much', 'cast', 'real', 'impediment', 'enjoying', 'film', 'plus', 'side', 'daring', 'portray', 'baseless', 'bravado', 'fear', 'experienced', 'ordinary', 'soldier', 'profusion', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'types', 'overwrought', 'self-important', 'narration', 'unnecessary', 're-arrangement', 'Crane', 'plot', 'combine', 'muddle', 'story', 'arc', 'render', 'film', 'too', 'set', 'piece', 'mentality', 'characters', 'are', 'pitted', 'mechanically', 'one', 'crisis', 'Huston', 'next', 'film', 'African', 'Queen', 'out', 'such', 'classic', 'Reason', 'sterling', 'acting', 'abilities', 'Bogart', 'Hepburn', 'pulled', 'film', 'way', 'sadly', 'Murphy', 'Mauldin', 'others', 'can', 'not', '.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'skimpy', 'comprising', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'static', 'listing', 'cast', 'one', 'extra', 'fascinating', 'comparing', 'RBOC', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'not', 'trailer', 'most', 'lunkheaded', 'claim', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'paraphrase', 'years', 'come', 'Red', 'Badge', 'Courage', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'memorable', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'Comparing', 'one', 'work', 'film', 'glorified', 'KKK', 'feat', 'so', 'bizarre', 'monument', 'social', 'blindness', 'film', 'marketers', 'era.Huston', 'Red', 'Badge', 'Courage', 'disappointing', 'plodding', 'barely', 'worthwhile', 'way', 'visualize', 'events', 'book', 'best', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'worse', 'better', 'adaptation', 'produced', 'RBOC', 'work', 'should', 'be', 'experienced', 'one', 'form', 'only', 'printed', 'page']",The Red Badge of Courage VHS

You see the fear of battle in him and you can feel it through the screen also. His reaction to cannon and rifle fire remind me of my uncle who served in Nam and how he reacted to the sounds of battle after that.In this day and age of DVD's someone should try to find the lost footage to this and re cut it like Mr. Huston wanted it done so we can all see that Mr. Murphy was more than just a hero, he was a very talented actor who wasn't given the due he should have gotten while he was with us.",5,"If this Great film is what we get with people messing with it, what a masterpiece it would be if restored",1174867200,"03 26, 2007",2007,860,"['One', 'John', 'Huston', 'better', 'films', 'saying', 'lot', 'studio', 're', 'cut', 'what', 'called', 'A', 'damn', 'mess', 'Well', 'even', 'mess', 'great', 'masterpiece', 'been', 'formed', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'most', 'decorated', 'hero', 'only', 'teen', 'believe', 'youth', 'story', 'more', 'talent', 'anyone', 'ever', 'gave', 'credit', 'role', 'see', 'fear', 'battle', 'can', 'feel', 'screen', 'also', 'reaction', 'cannon', 'rifle', 'fire', 'uncle', 'who', 'served', 'Nam', 'how', 'reacted', 'sounds', 'battle', 'that.In', 'day', 'age', 'DVD', 'someone', 'should', 'try', 'find', 'lost', 'footage', 're', 'cut', 'Mr.', 'Huston', 'wanted', 'done', 'can', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Murphy', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'hero', 'was', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'due', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'was']",The Red Badge of Courage VHS

As soon as it was finished, he left to work on The AfricanQueen, leaving the editing in the hands of the studio. But it was1951, the height of the McCarthy era. There was a movement in thiscountry against anti-war films. And so the film was cut to a mere 69minutes, which put it into the category of a &quot;B&quot; movie to beshown only as a second feature. That was a full fifty years ago, andin spite of the supposed butchering job on the cutting room floor, thefilm definitely has stood the test of time. Of course I will neverknow what the original was supposed to be. And I haven't even read thenovel. But I sure am glad I saw this video.I understand that StevenCrane wrote the book in 1894, which was a full thirty years after theCivil War. He was 22 years old at the time and had never actually beenin a battle himself. He was trying to say something about war andcourage and human nature rather than about the specific war. And sohis work is unique among the vast body of writings about that awfulperiod of history that tore at the heart and soul of ourcountry.Audie Murphy stars as The Youth and, with the exception ofAndy Devine who has a small role lasting no more than a minute, therest of the cast are unknowns. They all portray Union soldiers and wefirst see them bored and anxious to fight a battle. They brag abouttheir courage and how they all intend to stand firm in the heat ofbattle. The Youth has his doubts and the tension mounts as theinevitable battle tests them all. Frightened, The Youth flees. Laterthough, he returns and proves his manhood. The story is as simple asthat.There is also a narrator in the story, reading excerpts from thepen of Steven Crane. The language is beautiful and adds depth to thesimple conversations of the soldiers. The black and white photographyis grainy and much of it is shot in shadow, adding to the intimacy andthe authenticity of the film. There was a literary rhythm to it alland it added intensity.The role called for excellent acting and AudieMurphy was perfect. I understand that in real life he won nationalfame as the most decorated GI in WW2, winning 45 medals. He led aturbulent life, plagued by what is now known as post traumatic stresssyndrome. A compulsive gambler, he won and lost fortunes, was addictedto prescription sleeping pills and was once acquitted of attemptedmurder charges stemming from a fistfight. But all that came later. In1951, he was perfect for the role of The Youth.

Mayer never wanted the picture to be made and did what he could to discourage the process. He felt it could never be a commercial success without female characters or established stars. Mayer expressed his views directly to John Huston, he said, ""It has no story and won't make a cent!""When the film was finally completed, the test screenings were a failure. Houston remarked: ""With the Red Badge of Courage, I quite understood at the time why they took the steps they did. I was present at a preview when damn near a third of the audience got up and walked out of the theatre.""Various edits were tried without the participation of Huston, who was working on the ""African Queen"" with Bogart and Hepburn, and seemed to not give a damn. All that resulted was a picture that got shorter and shorter. The final release version is 69 minutes. The original cut was of 95 minutes, not two hours as has been suggested.""...they cut out one scene that was probably the best in the picture, in a way of anticlimax. The monumental death of the tall soldier. The boy and the tattered soldier walk away down the hill, and the tattered fellow says, ""I've never seen a feller die like that."" He begins to ramble and begins to walk around in circles then dies himself. This was the most extraordinary moment in the picture as far as I was concerned. It wouldn't have made any difference so far as the audience was concerned. They still walked out in the middle of the picture.""The footage that was extracted was from the master negative. It was discarded to the floor of the editing suite and thrown away as useless. There are no records of any of the cut scenes or extra footage surviving.Louis B. Mayer dispatched a second unit to Huston's ranch. The second unit was to film the battle scenes in Technicolor using the Cinematographic process: MGM Camera 65. Louis B. Mayer, at his most vindictive, shot footage that would eventually be used in future productions with the full knowledge of Huston.As the problems mounted, Huston's enthusiasm for the project waned and he started to gravitate towards his next project.

Based on Stephen Crane's novel set in the Civil War, this tale of a Union Army youth who's fear makes him flee from the battleline, actually gets a patriotic rejuvination when the youth overcomes his understandable state of being a &quot;mental outcast&quot; and rejoins his unit. Some may see his subsequent bravery as overcompensation, since one wonders just how important it is to have the flag ahead of the troops in an advance. The youth's genuine sensitivity is juxtaposed with the phony crowing of the other soldiers, some naive, most expressed to conceal their own fear. It's remarkable that as the youth, Audie Murphy conveys an emotionalism that is lacking in his later Western career. One senses that the music by Bronislau Kaper is studio imposed, but the narration with excerpts from the book may well be Huston's contribution, considering he did the same thing with The Bible. Whoever decided on the readings, they are a mistake since Crane's writing is embarassingly awful. Huston stages the battle scenes with a formal elegance that also captures the general stupidity of the activity.

John Huston had expectations this would be his masterpiece; and even with the editing and other flaws caused by studio in-fighting, it is still a close run thing. I would love to see the &#34;director's cut&#34; but alas the edited-out potions have apparently been lost over time. In addition to the story from Crane's novel - which is still a fairly faithful adaption even with the editing - and Huston's masterful direction, the film showcases a very young Audie Murphy, one of the most decorated soldiers of WW II; and Bill Mauldin, the WW II cartoonist of &#34;Willie and Joe&#34; fame. They both account for themselves quite well. The support casting is also spot on; and Huston's use of B&W film noir cinematography to simulate the horrors of battle is innovative.

Crane's novel of youth, written when Crane was in his early twenties, is an exploration of the nature of courage as measured in the crucible of battle.  Civil War battle, to be exact.  The Youth - that's how he's listed in the credits - along with the Loud Soldier (Bill Mauldin,) the Tall Soldier (John Dierkes,) and the rest of his regiment are marching to the battlefield shortly after the movie opens.The `red badge' in the title is a battle scar, proof to the world - and yourself - that you have sufficient courage to belong.  Whether that type of physical courage is today so highly and universally esteemed is debatable.  Certainly Mauldin and especially Murphy, two still-youth heroes of the Second World War, won't resonate with later audiences.  Mauldin enlisted in the army in 1940, and while in the service created the cartoon characters Willie and Joe, two average GIs fighting in Europe.  Willie and Joe appeared in Stars and Stripes and won for Mauldin the Pulitzer Prize in 1945.  Murphy was the most decorated combat American combat soldier of the war. Mauldin and Murphy's real-life courage was unquestioned, and Huston's use of the two in lead roles in canny.  It adds a unique layer of immediacy and realism to the story.There's a loose-limbed, deep focus, tight close-up look to the film that puts us under the skin of our universal Everyman soldiers.  Murphy always seemed somewhat stiff as an actor, but here Huston keeps the dialogue short and concentrates on the darting eyes and pursed lips of the unproven youth.  It works surprisingly well.  THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE is famous as a butchered film, one the studios took from the director and cut by some twenty minutes.  In fact, the running time for this one is a little over an hour, more suitable for a Boston Blackie episode than a major feature release.  Huston, the story goes, was outraged but diverted by preliminary work on his next project, The African Queen.  This is probably all so, but whoever did the re-cut knew what they were doing.  The finished product is a trim, muscular story that benefits from its brevity.",5,Audie Murphy's best film,1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,2330,"['Youth', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'first', 'taste', 'battle', 'be', 'more', ""'d"", 'bargained', 'fifty-years-old', 'John', 'Huston', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'Crane', 'THE', 'RED', 'BADGE', 'OF', 'COURAGE', 'up', 'remarkably', 'well', 'Crane', 'novel', 'youth', 'written', 'when', 'Crane', 'was', 'early', 'twenties', 'exploration', 'nature', 'courage', 'measured', 'crucible', 'battle', 'Civil', 'War', 'battle', 'be', 'exact', 'Youth', 'how', 'listed', 'credits', 'Loud', 'Soldier', 'Bill', 'Mauldin', 'Tall', 'Soldier', 'John', 'Dierkes', 'rest', 'regiment', 'are', 'marching', 'battlefield', 'shortly', 'movie', 'opens.The', 'red', 'badge', 'title', 'battle', 'scar', 'proof', 'world', 'have', 'sufficient', 'courage', 'belong', 'type', 'physical', 'courage', 'today', 'so', 'highly', 'universally', 'esteemed', 'debatable', 'Certainly', 'Mauldin', 'especially', 'Murphy', 'two', 'still-youth', 'heroes', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'wo', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'later', 'audiences', 'Mauldin', 'enlisted', 'army', '1940', 'service', 'created', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'Willie', 'Joe', 'two', 'average', 'GIs', 'fighting', 'Europe', 'Willie', 'Joe', 'appeared', 'Stars', 'Stripes', 'won', 'Mauldin', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', '1945', 'Murphy', 'was', 'most', 'decorated', 'combat', 'American', 'combat', 'soldier', 'war', 'Mauldin', 'Murphy', 'real-life', 'courage', 'was', 'unquestioned', 'Huston', 'use', 'two', 'lead', 'roles', 'canny', 'unique', 'layer', 'immediacy', 'realism', 'story.There', 'loose-limbed', 'deep', 'focus', 'tight', 'close-up', 'look', 'film', 'skin', 'universal', 'Everyman', 'soldiers', 'Murphy', 'always', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'stiff', 'actor', 'here', 'Huston', 'dialogue', 'short', 'concentrates', 'darting', 'eyes', 'pursed', 'lips', 'unproven', 'youth', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'THE', 'RED', 'BADGE', 'OF', 'COURAGE', 'famous', 'butchered', 'film', 'one', 'studios', 'took', 'director', 'cut', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'fact', 'running', 'time', 'one', 'little', 'hour', 'more', 'suitable', 'Boston', 'Blackie', 'episode', 'major', 'feature', 'release', 'Huston', 'story', 'was', 'outraged', 'diverted', 'preliminary', 'work', 'next', 'project', 'African', 'Queen', 'probably', 'so', 'whoever', 'did', 're-cut', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'finished', 'product', 'trim', 'muscular', 'story', 'benefits', 'brevity']",The Red Badge of Courage VHS
