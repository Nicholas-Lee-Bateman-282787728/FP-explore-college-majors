It looks like something you'll find on A&E; channel.The movie is about this woman who had a cornea transplant from a dead donor and she ended up seeing how this donor was killed. From then on you can pretty much guess the rest of the story.So the plot is average. Acting has its good moments for a B movie but it got worse towards the end. Editing, script, sound, camera, special effects are nothing to speak about.AND IT'S NOT A CREEPY movie as the name suggested.. just so you know.As I said, rent it only if you have nothing good to watch.",3,Not too bad,1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,646,"['think', 'movie', 'okay', 'choice', 'run', 'out', 'mega', 'movies', 'watch', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'something', ""'ll"", 'find', 'A', 'E', 'channel.The', 'movie', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'cornea', 'transplant', 'dead', 'donor', 'ended', 'up', 'seeing', 'how', 'donor', 'was', 'killed', 'then', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guess', 'rest', 'story.So', 'plot', 'average', 'Acting', 'good', 'moments', 'B', 'movie', 'got', 'worse', 'end', 'Editing', 'script', 'sound', 'camera', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'nothing', 'speak', 'IT', 'NOT', 'A', 'CREEPY', 'movie', 'name', 'suggested..', 'just', 'so', 'know.As', 'said', 'rent', 'only', 'have', 'nothing', 'good', 'watch']",The Possessed

870181,AJK1CQJ7OBG1A,B0006J27YM,"lecudedag ""lecudedag""","[3, 3]","This DVD has three short films about demonic posession; The Devil's Spell, Witches' Dolls, and Resurrection of the Damned.The Devil's Spell: A blatant rip-off of the first Night of the Demons film about a group of college kids meeting in a house and one by one being turned into demons as they are slain in silly ways. There's not even a hint of skin in the one sex scene - in which continuity goes out the window. Even the boom mike comes into view at the beginning of the filmWitches' Dolls: Is an interesting (at times) story of an elderly woman who arrives in a guest house and who then proceeds to trick the guests into giving her their souls.Resurrection of the Damned: this is, in a sense the biggest rip-off of the bunch. It is a edited down version of the 1992 film ""Netherworld"" - it's exactly that same film, only with large pieces removed to make for a version that fits in with the format of this DVD.Netherworld/Resurrection of the Damned is an odd story of a guy visiting the deep south looking for his dead father.

Having said that, I picked up ""The Possesed"" based on his name alone. Anyone who has seen any of the Full Moon movies knows that you are not getting A+ stuff here. They are campy, fairly low budget flicks shot for straight-to-video. Nevertheless, I enjoyed them quite a bit.This piece of film sludge has NOTHING in common (except the budget, perhaps) with Charles Band's earlier works. There is absolutely no redeeming qualities to this poorly worked trilogy. The acting can only aspire to be pure dreck. There aren't even any good sex scenes to make up for the rest.
