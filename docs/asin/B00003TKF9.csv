This movie is near the very top of my 100 Greatest Sleepers(a very cherished list)and near the very top of my Movie Charm list. It is the top, though, of my Greatest Movie endings list, contrary to a lot of Amazon reviewers. That means I think it has a better ending than 2001 or Some Like It Hot or A Clockwork Orange or Ball of Fire or All Quiet on the Western Front or Blow-Up. It breaks me every time.It's one of the sweetest movies ever made and I'm going to purchase the DVD this weekend. I found it on VHS some time ago and was dismayed to find that it had the late night supermarket scene removed and I'm dying to have a copy with it restored. After many repeated viewings I went from finding the supermarket sequence, originally, a silly outta place slapstick moment to later it being an integral part of the resolution and essential to the impact of the ending.I'm not the biggest fan of George C Scott. I often find he's chewing the scenery. That's not to say that I don't think he's a great actor and that I don't like many of his films. This is my favorite of his performances and I think the role is perfectly suited for his style. He also seems to be enjoying himself tremendously. He was so rarely given a chance to play lighter or comic roles. An unfortunate fact considering how well he did with this role and with General Buck in Dr Strangelove.Joanne Woodard is the perfect counterpoint and has all the needed skill to be able to play off such a powerhouse as Scott,  keeping everything in balance.Both play their part with great vunerablity while hiding behind their facades. There some great acting going on here.Add an seemingly endless ensemble supporting cast of great character actors like Jack Gilford and Al Lewis and Oliver Clark and many others. Plus a teriffic script, full of wit and heart and room to let everybody to spread their wings and you have one of the most charming undiscovered gems in the world.Mind you, this isn't for everyone. It has to be watched with a little sensitivity and patience and it's quirky to say the least. When they go to the phone company, well, there aren't too many scenes like that anywhere else(Most directors are too afraid something like that just won't work). Films of the late sixties and seventies were just a little more courageous and less worried with the bottom line. So, during that time we get some of the greatest flops and some of the sweetest sucesses.If you liked comedies with that NYC flavor like The Owl and the Pussycat or Little Fugitive or Little Murders, you'll like this movie.

546648,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00003TKF9,C. O. DeRiemer,"[8, 9]","How likely is a whimsical romance between a classic, delusional paranoid and his doctor? Perhaps not likely, unless the paranoid is Justin Playfair, who since his wife died two years previously believes he is Sherlock Holmes (George C. Scott), and the psychiatrist hired to commit him for life to an insane asylum, who is named Dr. Mildred Watson (Joanne Woodward). The movie sounds too cute for words, but is in fact a witty, clever look at how solitary people can find all kinds of strength and affection when they come together. Well, that's true for most of the movie. There are two weaknesses, one minor and one major, to deal with before Holmes and Dr. Watson prepare themselves for their meeting with Moriarty.Playfair was an astute and wealthy New York judge, noted for his analytical mind and dedication to justice. When his wife died he descended into paranoia. Now he is Sherlock Holmes, obsessed with finding the evil genius Moriarty. He dresses like Holmes, sounds faintly British and possesses an acute eye for analysis. ""Half the trick in finding clues is knowing that they're there,"" he says. He is superb at finding clues everyone else misses. His younger brother, Blevins Playfair, is determined to have him committed to an insane asylum. Not because Holmes is a danger to anyone, but because Blevins is in debt to criminals. With Holmes institutionalized, Blevins will control the family fortune. The criminals believe that simply shooting Holmes would be a far quicker way to insure that Blevins gets the money to pay them back.Dr. Watson is the one person who must sign the documents to put Holmes away. She's not going to do this until she can examine him. The last thing Blevins wants is for Watson to think Holmes can be cured. ""You don't think he can be, do you?"" Blevins asks Watson. ""Cure a classic? Once in a generation. It's a marvelous disease, you know. The victim's faculties grow keener and ultra-sensitive...and he's capable of things that seem like genius."" Before long, however, Holmes is on the trail of Moriarty and Watson must follow along if she's going to fully diagnosis her patient. In the process, Holmes finds a grudging respect for Watson. He's been waiting for his Watson for a long time and is prepared to accept the fact that this Dr. Watson is a woman. ""If I'm such a liability,"" she tells him with acerbity, ""what do you want me for?"" Holmes looks at her in a mildly friendly way. ""Oh, you mustn't feel inferior. Try saying to yourself, 'I'm adequate.'"" Mildred Watson, a slightly dowdy woman with a messy apartment who can't cook, is finally drawn to Holmes' integrity and passion. Will this be love? In an odd sort of way, yes, it will be.As Holmes pursues Moriarty's clues throughout New York City, he and Watson encounter a number of engaging misfits, lonely people and eccentrics. It all works until we get to the first bump in the road...that minor weakness. Taken one at a time, the eccentrics make for engaging and touching vignettes. Put all the eccentrics together, marching purposefully behind Watson and Holmes down a dark street and then rescuing the two from the police in a huge, empty supermarket, and we come dangerously close to the whimsical cutes.Then we must deal with a major question, and we encounter the major weakness. How will the movie end? Each one who sees the movie will most likely find their own answer. Perhaps that was the author's and director's intention. For me, I can't help but think that they simply couldn't come up with an effective conclusion based on the plot they had developed. Since I had come to like Holmes and Watson so much, I was left with wanting a conclusion I could smile at. What I was left with was a head scratch.Scott and Woodward do marvelous jobs in creating two lonely characters we begin to root for. As actors, they were worth every penny they were paid. For lessons in star quality and acting skill, pay close attention to Scott as he teases out of a mute patient why the man doesn't speak, and later to Woodward as she prepares a dinner for Holmes in her apartment. For a lesson in team acting by two equally matched pros, watch Holmes and Watson realize how they feel about each other at Watson's apartment. Scattered throughout the movie are some fine actors playing the eccentrics and assorted other characters, a few so quickly seen they're easily lost. Some to look for include Jack Gilford, Eugene Roche, Al Lewis, James Tolkan, F. Murray Abraham, M. Emmet Walsh, Rue McLanahan, Staats Cotsworth (of Casey, Crime Photographer fame on radio), Kitty Winn and Worthington Minor. He was the producer a long time ago behind Studio One when television every week presented live drama.The DVD picture looks fine. There are a handful of extras, including a commentary by the director and a valentine to the joys of New York City. They Might Be Giants is a fine movie. It's well worth watching for the skilled characterizations by two star actors and for an excellent script. While I might find the last ten minutes a bit unsatisfying, Sherlock Holmes and Mildred Watson are still worth believing in. As Holmes says as he and Watson stand together looking into the dark, ""We're coming for you, Moriarty. We may not look like much. We may not have your weapons. We may lack your dark allies. Why, we may even lose...I'm not invincible. But together, sir, we may surprise you!""",4,"Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Mildred Watson, George C.

546652,A59EAODMJ673M,B00003TKF9,John Gentile,"[7, 8]","This is a GREAT film that was unnoticed upon it's original release because of its quirkiness.It concerns a judge (played by Scott) who believes he is Sherlock Holmes. He lives in a complete fantasy world, which he created right after his beloved wife died, to provided shelter from a cold world.  However, he finds the fantasy world a bit lonely, for no one believes he is Holmes.

546654,A1QFM9CFEUXZK5,B00003TKF9,Kendra,"[6, 7]","I was lucky enough to find a dvd of this film just the other day. Although it's not worth the inflated $200 it's selling for here (and higher), it is an excellent film. And, if you can find a copy at a reasonable price, it's worth having.  The acting is wonderful, the scenes of 70s New York are so authentically gritty, and the movie is a whole lot of fun.  Interestingly enough, my husband mentioned to me that he had never really wanted to see this movie before since he didn't think Scott would make a believable Holmes. Almost immediately into the movie, he admitted how wrong he was.George C. Scott plays a delusional former judge.  He believes he is Sherlock Holmes and it is likely that he became delusional after the death of his wife a year or so before.  While a jurist, he always attempted to do good-- always attempted to make the world a better and safer place.  Now, as Holmes, he attributes all the evil in the world to his nemesis, Moriarty.Joanne Woodward is Dr. Watson-- a psychiatrist at the mental health clinic.  She does good works, but her personal life is pretty much in shambles.  She's lonely, drinks herself to sleep, and doesn't have too high of a self-image.  Her signature is required on the papers needed to commit the judge to the institution so that Holmes' brother, one of the board members of the asylum, will gain legal control over Holmes' money which will enable him to pay off his blackmailers.Holmes knows that there are people after him, and believes they are led by Moriarty.  He spends his days searching for clues to Moriarty's whereabouts so that he and Moriarty can have their final showdown.  Because Dr. Watson is eager to learn more about her new patient before signing commitment papers, she is drawn into his clue-finding endeavors.With Dr. Watson tagging along, both she and Holmes scour the city for clues-- making friends with a variety of folks along the way.  And, along the way, Watson and Holmes fall in love.This is really a wonderful story about two lonely people who find each other within the loneliness and anonymity of the big city.  Although Watson knows Holmes isn't ""really"" Holmes, she chooses to believe what he believes since he brings more joy and interest to her life in one day than she's had throughout her entire life.As for the ending (no spoilers):  Yes, the grocery store scene is here. I'm trying to picture to imagine the whole film without it, and it wouldn't have worked. So, it needed to be here, but it's too bad that the directors chose a scene like this in the first place and had no alternate to replace it with.  However, it is what it is, and some others may appreciate it.  Although I think this scene (and the marching scene) detracts a bit from the quality and feel of the entire movie, I don't think it ruins it.If the ending does leave one scratching his head, as one reviewer wrote, just wait a second after the screen fades to black.  Scrolling text will tie up the loose ends and confirm your suspicions about Holmes, Watson, and Moriarty on his horse.And, then, after that. . . well, it's likely Holmes will be Holmes.",4,Lots of bittersweet fun,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,3117,"['was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'find', 'dvd', 'film', 'just', 'other', 'day', 'not', 'worth', 'inflated', '200', 'selling', 'here', 'higher', 'excellent', 'film', 'can', 'find', 'copy', 'reasonable', 'price', 'worth', 'having', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'scenes', '70s', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'so', 'authentically', 'gritty', 'movie', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'husband', 'mentioned', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Scott', 'would', 'make', 'believable', 'Holmes', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'movie', 'admitted', 'how', 'wrong', 'was.George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'delusional', 'former', 'judge', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'likely', 'became', 'delusional', 'death', 'wife', 'year', 'so', 'before', 'jurist', 'always', 'attempted', 'do', 'good', 'always', 'attempted', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'safer', 'place', 'Now', 'Holmes', 'evil', 'world', 'nemesis', 'Moriarty.Joanne', 'Woodward', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'psychiatrist', 'mental', 'health', 'clinic', 'good', 'works', 'personal', 'life', 'pretty', 'much', 'shambles', 'lonely', 'drinks', 'sleep', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'high', 'self-image', 'signature', 'required', 'papers', 'needed', 'commit', 'judge', 'institution', 'Holmes', 'brother', 'one', 'board', 'members', 'asylum', 'will', 'gain', 'legal', 'control', 'Holmes', 'money', 'will', 'enable', 'pay', 'off', 'blackmailers.Holmes', 'are', 'people', 'are', 'led', 'Moriarty', 'days', 'searching', 'clues', 'Moriarty', 'whereabouts', 'so', 'Moriarty', 'can', 'have', 'final', 'showdown', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'eager', 'learn', 'more', 'new', 'patient', 'signing', 'commitment', 'papers', 'drawn', 'clue-finding', 'endeavors.With', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'tagging', 'along', 'Holmes', 'scour', 'city', 'clues', 'making', 'friends', 'variety', 'folks', 'way', 'way', 'Watson', 'Holmes', 'fall', 'love.This', 'really', 'wonderful', 'story', 'two', 'lonely', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'other', 'loneliness', 'anonymity', 'big', 'city', 'Watson', 'Holmes', ""n't"", 'really', 'Holmes', 'believe', 'what', 'more', 'joy', 'interest', 'life', 'one', 'day', 'had', 'entire', 'life.As', 'ending', 'spoilers', 'Yes', 'grocery', 'store', 'scene', 'here', ""'m"", 'trying', 'picture', 'imagine', 'whole', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'So', 'needed', 'be', 'here', 'too', 'bad', 'directors', 'chose', 'scene', 'first', 'place', 'had', 'alternate', 'replace', 'However', 'what', 'others', 'may', 'appreciate', 'think', 'scene', 'marching', 'scene', 'bit', 'quality', 'feel', 'entire', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'it.If', 'ending', 'leave', 'one', 'scratching', 'head', 'one', 'reviewer', 'wrote', 'just', 'wait', 'second', 'screen', 'black', 'Scrolling', 'text', 'will', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'confirm', 'suspicions', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'Moriarty', 'horse.And', 'then', 'well', 'likely', 'Holmes', 'will', 'be', 'Holmes']",N/A

I went to a friend's house, and told her & her mom about this odd take on Sherlock Holmes, and my friend's mom went off about how bad it was, how all the critics ripped it, but it's stuck with me over the years, much better than many of 1971's movies. While researching this review, I looked at some of the movies released that year:The Last Picture Show: The Definitive Director's Cut (Special Edition),Harold and Maude,The French Connection(I'm sorry, best picture??),Klute,Vanishing Point,Duel (Collector's Edition)(only the greatest TV movie ever),Walkabout - Criterion Collection,THX 1138 - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition),The Hired Hand, and another great George C.

546658,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00003TKF9,Robert Moore,"[50, 52]","What does it mean to be insane in a world that doesn't make sense?  Movies have revisited that question in a host of films over the years, from MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN to HARVEY to A THOUSAND CLOWNS to THE RULING CLASS to HAROLD AND MAUDE to CATCH-22 to OFFICE SPACE.  THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS is one of the more compelling films in this genre.  The film concerns the former Justice Playfair, who upon the death of his wife, loses his mind and believes that he is Sherlock Holmes.  His brother becomes enmeshed in a blackmail scheme, and to gain control over his brother's estate to pay off the blackmailers, attempt to have him committed.  To that end, he approaches the Strauss Clinic, whose head is anxious to commit because of the sizable amount of cash that Playfair's joining them will bring.  But they need to have their resident psychologist, Dr. Mildred Watson, sign the commitment papers, and before she is willing to do this, she insists on interviewing Playfair.  Our hero is resistant to her investigating him until it strikes him that she is truly Dr. Watson.  Perhaps not the male he was anticipating, but a Dr. Watson nonetheless.  So, the game is afoot, with the initially sceptical and resistant Watson following Playfair/Holmes in his investigation of a series of clues left by his great nemesis Moriarty.  What makes it easy for her to believe in Holmes is the fact that he is such a remarkably compelling Holmes.  His deductive powers are extraordinary, even Holmes-like.  Like Holmes in the novels, he can look at a person an deduce an extraordinary number of details about them.The title is taken from the greatest story of an insane individual in an insane world ever created, Cervantes's DON QUIXOTE.  Holmes explains to Watson that Quixote took it too far:  ""He thought that every windmill was a giant. That's insane. But, thinking that they might be, well . . . ""  As he explains later, one thing that shows how extraordinary human beings are the enemies arrayed against them, which is what Moriarty comes to represent.  Holmes comes to represent the quixotic aspects of human nature, which nutty everyday life violently opposes.  The film's title, by the way, inspired the founders of the group They Might Be Giants.This is one of George C. Scott's finest roles.  He was such a powerful, unique actor, that it is natural to think that he had a greater career than he did in fact.  The truth is that he made perhaps a half dozen truly great films, and many of those in supporting roles, such as ANATOMY OF A MURDER, THE HUSTLER, and DR. STRANGELOVE.  It is bizarre, in looking at his career, to realize that he managed far fewer great roles than his talent should have merited.  THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS came out a year after Scott's greatest screen role in PATTON.  This role as Playfair/Holmes was perfectly suited to his talents, and in many ways parallels his performance in Patton.  Both Patton and Holmes did not quite fit in the world in which they lived.  Both were idealists.  Both were in fundamental conflict with the society as a whole.  Part of what makes THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS work is the passion with which Scott sells the central role.  Joanne Woodward is marvelous as Dr. Watson.  Like Scott, she is someone who has been underutilized in her career.  Scott is a powerful presence, but Woodward manages not to be overwhelmed by his strong acting style.  The rest of the cast is a good deal less talented than the two principals.  You can, if you pay careful attention, recognize a very young F. Murray Abraham as the usher in the movie theater.  And I'm not certain of her name, but I've always felt grateful to the character actress who delivers one of my all time favorite surreal movie lines.  In their search for Moriarty, Holmes and Watson end up in the balcony of a theater, where a Western is showing.  We are not really shown what is happening on the screen, but at one point the woman who is the object of my gratitude leans forward in her chair, and reacting to what she sees in the film, utters passionately, ""God bless you, Barbara Stanwyck.""",5,"A film that ponders, ""What is insanity?""",1115596800,"05 9, 2005",2005,4087,"['What', 'mean', 'be', 'insane', 'world', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Movies', 'have', 'revisited', 'question', 'host', 'films', 'years', 'MR', 'DEEDS', 'GOES', 'TO', 'TOWN', 'HARVEY', 'A', 'THOUSAND', 'CLOWNS', 'THE', 'RULING', 'CLASS', 'HAROLD', 'AND', 'MAUDE', 'CATCH-22', 'OFFICE', 'SPACE', 'THEY', 'MIGHT', 'BE', 'GIANTS', 'one', 'more', 'compelling', 'films', 'genre', 'film', 'former', 'Justice', 'Playfair', 'who', 'death', 'wife', 'mind', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'brother', 'enmeshed', 'blackmail', 'scheme', 'gain', 'control', 'brother', 'estate', 'pay', 'off', 'blackmailers', 'attempt', 'have', 'committed', 'end', 'Strauss', 'Clinic', 'head', 'anxious', 'commit', 'sizable', 'amount', 'cash', 'Playfair', 'joining', 'will', 'bring', 'need', 'have', 'resident', 'psychologist', 'Dr.', 'Mildred', 'Watson', 'sign', 'commitment', 'papers', 'willing', 'do', 'interviewing', 'Playfair', 'hero', 'resistant', 'investigating', 'truly', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'male', 'was', 'anticipating', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'nonetheless', 'So', 'game', 'afoot', 'initially', 'sceptical', 'resistant', 'Watson', 'following', 'Playfair/Holmes', 'investigation', 'series', 'clues', 'left', 'great', 'nemesis', 'Moriarty', 'What', 'easy', 'believe', 'Holmes', 'fact', 'such', 'remarkably', 'compelling', 'Holmes', 'deductive', 'powers', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'even', 'Holmes-like', 'Holmes', 'novels', 'can', 'look', 'person', 'deduce', 'extraordinary', 'number', 'details', 'them.The', 'title', 'taken', 'greatest', 'story', 'insane', 'individual', 'insane', 'world', 'ever', 'created', 'Cervantes', 'DON', 'QUIXOTE', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'Quixote', 'took', 'too', 'far', 'thought', 'windmill', 'was', 'giant', 'insane', 'thinking', 'might', 'be', 'well', 'later', 'one', 'thing', 'how', 'extraordinary', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'enemies', 'arrayed', 'what', 'Moriarty', 'represent', 'Holmes', 'represent', 'quixotic', 'aspects', 'human', 'nature', 'nutty', 'everyday', 'life', 'violently', 'film', 'title', 'way', 'inspired', 'founders', 'group', 'Might', 'Be', 'Giants.This', 'one', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'finest', 'roles', 'was', 'such', 'powerful', 'unique', 'actor', 'natural', 'think', 'had', 'greater', 'career', 'did', 'fact', 'truth', 'made', 'perhaps', 'half', 'dozen', 'truly', 'great', 'films', 'many', 'supporting', 'roles', 'such', 'ANATOMY', 'A', 'MURDER', 'THE', 'HUSTLER', 'DR.', 'STRANGELOVE', 'bizarre', 'looking', 'career', 'realize', 'managed', 'far', 'fewer', 'great', 'roles', 'talent', 'should', 'have', 'merited', 'THEY', 'MIGHT', 'BE', 'GIANTS', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'Scott', 'greatest', 'screen', 'role', 'PATTON', 'role', 'Playfair/Holmes', 'was', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'talents', 'many', 'ways', 'parallels', 'performance', 'Patton', 'Both', 'Patton', 'Holmes', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'fit', 'world', 'lived', 'were', 'idealists', 'were', 'fundamental', 'conflict', 'society', 'whole', 'Part', 'what', 'THEY', 'MIGHT', 'BE', 'GIANTS', 'work', 'passion', 'Scott', 'central', 'role', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'marvelous', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'Scott', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'underutilized', 'career', 'Scott', 'powerful', 'presence', 'Woodward', 'not', 'be', 'overwhelmed', 'strong', 'acting', 'style', 'rest', 'cast', 'good', 'deal', 'less', 'talented', 'two', 'principals', 'can', 'pay', 'careful', 'attention', 'recognize', 'very', 'young', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'usher', 'movie', 'theater', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'name', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'grateful', 'character', 'actress', 'who', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'surreal', 'movie', 'lines', 'search', 'Moriarty', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'end', 'up', 'balcony', 'theater', 'where', 'Western', 'showing', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'shown', 'what', 'happening', 'screen', 'one', 'point', 'woman', 'who', 'object', 'gratitude', 'forward', 'chair', 'reacting', 'what', 'film', 'utters', 'passionately', 'God', 'bless', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck']",N/A

546661,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B00003TKF9,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[14, 14]","The late, great George C. Scott does a fine turn as a widower judge who thinks he's Sherlock Holmes in &quot;They Might Be Giants,&quot; a film that proves Scott easily could have played the fictional detective in a straight adaptation of Conan Doyle's mysteries, too.  The film takes great delight in lampooning the establishment of the day--no surprise, as it debuted in 1971--with particular attention on cutting down to size the burgeoning mental health industry.  Joanne Woodward is charming as a psychiatrist and social misfit, appropriately named Dr. Watson, who teams up with Scott to track the nefarious Moriarity, only to discover love and destiny instead.  Along the way, they are joined by a battalion of New York City's cataways, including laconic Jack Gilford, a young M. Emmet Walsh, F. Murray Abraham with an afro, and even Paul Benedict, the fellow who would go on to fame as &quot;Mr. Bentley&quot; of television's &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; fame.  Though it has an atypical but beguiling score by John Barry and some very tender moments courtesy of screenwriter James Goldman (Gilford's affinity for swashbuckling and Watson's doomed attempt at a romantic dinner among them), &quot;They Might Be Giants&quot; sometimes suffers from a lack of thematic focus that rivals the mania of its main characters.  A slapstick scene in a grocery store seems tonally wrong in a film that otherwise takes the high road of satire rather than the low road of farce.  (Apparently, it was originally excised from the film, only to return in a later version, though I recall seeing the film on TV as a child in the 70s, and the grocery store scene was intact.)  Commentary by the film's director, Anthony Harvey, is worth noting, though the man interviewing him dodges the most obvious question burning in the mind's of viewers--exactly what is one to make of the film's ending?",4,Sherlock Holmes as You've Never Seen Him Before,1074988800,"01 25, 2004",2004,1879,"['late', 'great', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'fine', 'turn', 'widower', 'judge', 'who', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'quot', 'Might', 'Be', 'Giants', 'quot', 'film', 'Scott', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'fictional', 'detective', 'straight', 'adaptation', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'mysteries', 'too', 'film', 'great', 'delight', 'lampooning', 'establishment', 'day', 'surprise', 'debuted', '1971', 'particular', 'attention', 'cutting', 'down', 'size', 'burgeoning', 'mental', 'health', 'industry', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'charming', 'psychiatrist', 'social', 'misfit', 'appropriately', 'named', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'who', 'up', 'Scott', 'track', 'nefarious', 'Moriarity', 'only', 'discover', 'love', 'destiny', 'instead', 'way', 'are', 'joined', 'battalion', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'cataways', 'including', 'laconic', 'Jack', 'Gilford', 'young', 'M.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'afro', 'even', 'Paul', 'Benedict', 'fellow', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'fame', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Bentley', 'quot', 'television', 'quot', 'Jeffersons', 'quot', 'fame', 'atypical', 'beguiling', 'score', 'John', 'Barry', 'very', 'tender', 'moments', 'courtesy', 'screenwriter', 'James', 'Goldman', 'Gilford', 'affinity', 'swashbuckling', 'Watson', 'doomed', 'attempt', 'romantic', 'dinner', 'quot', 'Might', 'Be', 'Giants', 'quot', 'suffers', 'lack', 'thematic', 'focus', 'mania', 'main', 'characters', 'slapstick', 'scene', 'grocery', 'store', 'tonally', 'wrong', 'film', 'otherwise', 'high', 'road', 'satire', 'rather', 'low', 'road', 'farce', 'Apparently', 'was', 'originally', 'excised', 'film', 'only', 'return', 'later', 'version', 'recall', 'seeing', 'film', 'TV', 'child', '70s', 'grocery', 'store', 'scene', 'was', 'intact', 'Commentary', 'film', 'director', 'Anthony', 'Harvey', 'worth', 'noting', 'man', 'interviewing', 'most', 'obvious', 'question', 'burning', 'mind', 'viewers', 'exactly', 'what', 'one', 'make', 'film', 'ending']",N/A

Scott, the man who made famous the line/promise in Dr. Strangelove ""no more than 20 to 30 million killed - tops!""The main critical blurb on the cover is Leonard Maltin's not-so-promising three star rating.  The premise is that George C. Scott's character is a brilliant former judge who now thinks he's Sherlock Holmes, Joanne Woodward is his shrink.  Together they set out to find Moriarty.

546664,A3CW4EZUTEV0VC,B00003TKF9,The Rocketman,"[3, 5]","They don't make movies like this anymore.In fact, judging by the treatment this movie got on release by Universal, they didn't make movies like this in the 70's.For those that associate George C. Scott with a bombastic type (a la PATTON and DR. STRANGELOVE) this movie will come as a shock.  Of course, if you know Scott's work in THE HUSTLER, you won't be surprised in the least.Scott plays a Quixotic figure, a man who believes he is Sherlock Holmes.  A psychiatrist played by Joanne Woodward and named - appropriately - Dr. Watson, is supposed to diagnose the man so he can be committed, but instead becomes enraptured with his good natured charm.The problem that people have in coming to this film is that, because it is about a character that thinks he is Sherlock Holmes, they believe they are in for a mystery movie.  In fact, this film is a romantic comedy, and when viewed in this light, the plot threads that don't tie up neatly make a lot more sense:  they are there merely to serve the love story between Scott and Woodward.  In fact, although the title THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS is stated in the movie as referring to the windmills that Don Quixote tilts at, it may also be referring to the two leading characters... and, in fact, all of us.The print of the film is very good as can be seen by comparing the film to the featurette included on the disc.  In addition, the film is a sort of ""director's cut"" as a scene deleted by the studio on initial release (in the grocery store) has been re-included.The slapstick of the grocery store scene gives the movie a slightly dated feel.  Scenes like this, where authority figures were ridiculed in such a farcical way were common in the 60s-70s (i.e. THE PARTY) but don't play as well today.  Interestingly, the music under the scene was added by the studio (not the movie's creative team) and it only hurts the scene more.  Another example of why the suits need to stick to their ledgers.Nevertheless, this is a movie to be watched, both for it's thematic elements as well as the real chemistry between Scott and Woodward.  The supporting performances (including many characters that became recognizable from TV land in the 70s) are excellent as well.The commentary on the disc is, unfortunately, not that great.  Harris' interview with director Tony Harvey seems to include nearly every film Harvey was involved in *except* THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS, and this is a fault of the interviewer who can't seem to stay on topic or ask follow up questions.  One would like more insight into why Harvey was attracted to the script, for example, or what were the issues of turning the play into the movie.  There are also large gaps in the commentary track, surprising since the movie is well under 2 hours.  My advise is to listen to the commentary under the entire grocery store scene for some real insight, after that you aren't missing much.After watching this film, you may want to go to have a look at other subtle George C. Scott performances, including another film he made around the same time, THE HOSPITAL (1971), as well as the overlooked performance in HARDCORE (1979), both available on DVD.",4,A Gentle George + A peculiar commentary track,1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,3146,"['do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'anymore.In', 'fact', 'judging', 'treatment', 'movie', 'got', 'release', 'Universal', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', ""70's.For"", 'associate', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'bombastic', 'type', 'la', 'PATTON', 'DR.', 'STRANGELOVE', 'movie', 'will', 'come', 'shock', 'course', 'know', 'Scott', 'work', 'THE', 'HUSTLER', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'least.Scott', 'Quixotic', 'figure', 'man', 'who', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'A', 'psychiatrist', 'played', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'named', 'appropriately', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'supposed', 'diagnose', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'committed', 'instead', 'becomes', 'enraptured', 'good', 'natured', 'charm.The', 'problem', 'people', 'have', 'coming', 'film', 'character', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'believe', 'are', 'mystery', 'movie', 'fact', 'film', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'when', 'viewed', 'light', 'plot', 'threads', 'do', ""n't"", 'tie', 'up', 'neatly', 'make', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'are', 'there', 'merely', 'serve', 'love', 'story', 'Scott', 'Woodward', 'fact', 'title', 'THEY', 'MIGHT', 'BE', 'GIANTS', 'stated', 'movie', 'referring', 'windmills', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'tilts', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'referring', 'two', 'leading', 'characters', 'fact', 'us.The', 'print', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'comparing', 'film', 'featurette', 'included', 'disc', 'addition', 'film', 'sort', 'director', 'cut', 'scene', 'deleted', 'studio', 'initial', 'release', 'grocery', 'store', 'been', 're-included.The', 'slapstick', 'grocery', 'store', 'scene', 'movie', 'slightly', 'dated', 'feel', 'Scenes', 'where', 'authority', 'figures', 'were', 'ridiculed', 'such', 'farcical', 'way', 'were', 'common', '60s-70s', 'i.e', 'THE', 'PARTY', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'as', 'well', 'today', 'Interestingly', 'music', 'scene', 'was', 'added', 'studio', 'not', 'movie', 'creative', 'team', 'only', 'scene', 'more', 'example', 'why', 'suits', 'need', 'stick', 'ledgers.Nevertheless', 'movie', 'be', 'watched', 'thematic', 'elements', 'as', 'well', 'real', 'chemistry', 'Scott', 'Woodward', 'supporting', 'performances', 'including', 'many', 'characters', 'became', 'recognizable', 'TV', 'land', '70s', 'are', 'excellent', 'well.The', 'commentary', 'disc', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'great', 'Harris', 'interview', 'director', 'Tony', 'Harvey', 'include', 'nearly', 'film', 'Harvey', 'was', 'involved', '*except*', 'THEY', 'MIGHT', 'BE', 'GIANTS', 'fault', 'interviewer', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stay', 'topic', 'ask', 'follow', 'up', 'questions', 'One', 'would', 'like', 'more', 'insight', 'why', 'Harvey', 'was', 'attracted', 'script', 'example', 'were', 'issues', 'turning', 'play', 'movie', 'are', 'also', 'large', 'gaps', 'commentary', 'track', 'surprising', 'movie', 'well', '2', 'hours', 'advise', 'listen', 'commentary', 'entire', 'grocery', 'store', 'scene', 'real', 'insight', 'are', ""n't"", 'missing', 'much.After', 'watching', 'film', 'may', 'want', 'go', 'have', 'look', 'other', 'subtle', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'performances', 'including', 'film', 'made', 'same', 'time', 'THE', 'HOSPITAL', '1971', 'as', 'well', 'overlooked', 'performance', 'HARDCORE', '1979', 'available', 'DVD']",N/A
