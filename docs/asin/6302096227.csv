Many people I have spoken with think this is a very good movie.  I think they like it more for the syspense factor from what I can tell. Perhaps someone can gain some compassion from this movie because it feels this way to be in an abusive relationship. They really did their research or someone knew something when directing and writing the screenplay.  I know nothing about the book and am not focusing about the socioeconic status of the woman of the book vs the movie like the previous reviewer.  Unless you are comparing and constrasing the 2 for a term paper forget about that.  I do not think that is really important to the story as domestic violence can occur in all economic levels. When you see stress of the wife trying not to upset her husband with stupid little things like arranging the cans of food in a cabnet.  This is what some abusers are really like.  Anything and Nothing will set off an abuser like that.  The Victim gets punished for these things as an excuse for him to get out his anger or control just like the movie.  This really lets you know what it is like to be in an abusive relationship from the inside.  If you let yourself you can get into the character just as a movie like (A Beautiful Mind) you can get inside a character.  They are totally different movies, but they have a similar delivery style.  This is a very disturbing movie and I would not recomend it for young people unless it is in the context of teaching about domestic violence or perhaps preventing it.  Next to being in an abusive relationship this is the closest you can get unless they make another movie.  This would be a good movie for someone counselling domestic violence victums or anyone going into the psychology field.  If you are a student of one of those diciplines you might want to watch this to desinsitize yourself to what people may tell you and to familiarize yourself with abuse.If not this is another syspense movie that is really well done and some people find it entertaining.  I think it is more educational, but the delivery is entertaining to some people.  I think it is just that some people seem to crave violent movies of all types and do not think about the message even when someone goes to the trouble to have a real plot and storyline.I hope that helps.",5,Very disturbing because it is realistic.

295251,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302096227,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Films of this nature run a real risk of becoming almost soap operish if they aren't careful.  Maybe that's a bad comparison.  They can easily slip into the realm of the `Lifetime Movie of the Week', where they wash away the reality of it all and become slightly campy.  Not so campy that they are unintentionally funny and thus worthy of eventual cult worship, but just campy enough to feel awkward and unrealistic and just un-good.`Sleeping With the Enemy' has that problem.The film centers around a young woman, Laura Burney, who lives what seems to be a perfect life but is truly anything but.  Her controlling and manipulative husband Martin is a cold hearted man who lays his hands on her and simply terrorizes her emotionally, to the point where she feels the only escape is to die.  So, she fakes her own death and flees to start her life anew, in another town under another name.  Things are going better for Laura.  She even has a new boyfriend, Ben.  But the past has a way of catching up with you, and soon Martin is back in her life making his best effort at destroying hers.The first half of the film is very well done.  It is moody and intense and Julia Roberts stretches her acting chops to prove that she is more than a pretty face.  She attacks her scenes with a raw intensity that adds a certain layer of reality to the proceedings.  But, soon after Laura makes that transition from abused spouse to fugitive the film's tone changes in a way that breaks nearly everything that had initially been set up for us.  It becomes a Lifetime movie.  It's the little things (the reviewer here already called out the `hat' sequence, and that is a perfect example of the tonal shift that destroyed what Joseph Ruben tried so hard to establish in the film's outset) that really derail the film to the point where when the supposed `terror' is reinserted into the film's fabric it is too little too late and ultimately backfires.  It starts to feel campy and unrealistic in the same way that films like `Fear' and the more recent `Enough' trailed that line that simply shouldn't be trailed.  You need to either stand on one side or the other.  Like I said, this is a tricky genre because it lends itself so easily to melodrama that feels forced and manipulative, and not in a good way.But for as much `bad' as there is in the films overall construction, Roberts is very good here.  I really love what she is able to pull off, even when the script reduces her to a stereotype or, worse yet, a conundrum.  Her fearful decline is enormously effective in setting a perfect mood for the film; it's just a shame that the film itself couldn't live up to her presence.",3,A few false moves derail a nicely manicured premise...,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,2665,"['Films', 'nature', 'run', 'real', 'risk', 'becoming', 'almost', 'soap', 'operish', 'are', ""n't"", 'careful', 'Maybe', 'bad', 'comparison', 'can', 'easily', 'slip', 'realm', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Week', 'where', 'wash', 'away', 'reality', 'become', 'slightly', 'campy', 'Not', 'so', 'campy', 'are', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'thus', 'worthy', 'eventual', 'cult', 'worship', 'just', 'campy', 'enough', 'feel', 'awkward', 'unrealistic', 'just', 'un-good.', 'Sleeping', 'Enemy', 'problem.The', 'film', 'centers', 'young', 'woman', 'Laura', 'Burney', 'who', 'what', 'be', 'perfect', 'life', 'truly', 'anything', 'controlling', 'manipulative', 'husband', 'Martin', 'cold', 'hearted', 'man', 'who', 'hands', 'simply', 'terrorizes', 'emotionally', 'point', 'where', 'only', 'escape', 'die', 'So', 'own', 'death', 'flees', 'start', 'life', 'anew', 'town', 'name', 'Things', 'are', 'going', 'better', 'Laura', 'even', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Ben', 'past', 'way', 'catching', 'up', 'soon', 'Martin', 'back', 'life', 'making', 'best', 'effort', 'destroying', 'hers.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'moody', 'intense', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'acting', 'chops', 'prove', 'more', 'pretty', 'face', 'scenes', 'raw', 'intensity', 'certain', 'layer', 'reality', 'proceedings', 'soon', 'Laura', 'transition', 'abused', 'spouse', 'fugitive', 'film', 'tone', 'changes', 'way', 'nearly', 'everything', 'had', 'initially', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'little', 'things', 'reviewer', 'here', 'already', 'called', 'out', 'hat', 'sequence', 'perfect', 'example', 'tonal', 'shift', 'destroyed', 'what', 'Joseph', 'Ruben', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'establish', 'film', 'outset', 'really', 'film', 'point', 'where', 'when', 'supposed', 'terror', 'reinserted', 'film', 'fabric', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'ultimately', 'backfires', 'feel', 'campy', 'unrealistic', 'same', 'way', 'films', 'Fear', 'more', 'recent', 'Enough', 'trailed', 'line', 'simply', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'trailed', 'need', 'stand', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'said', 'tricky', 'genre', 'so', 'easily', 'melodrama', 'feels', 'forced', 'manipulative', 'not', 'good', 'way.But', 'as', 'much', 'bad', 'films', 'overall', 'construction', 'Roberts', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'really', 'love', 'what', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'even', 'when', 'script', 'stereotype', 'worse', 'yet', 'conundrum', 'fearful', 'decline', 'enormously', 'effective', 'setting', 'perfect', 'mood', 'film', 'just', 'shame', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'presence']",N/A

Dare I say, it actually looks better now compared to when the film was first released?Julia Roberts isn't one of my favorite actresses, I admit, but she delivers a splendid performance here.  Throughout the movie, you see Julia's character trying to start over her life by moving to a small town in Iowa because her previous husband abused her pretty hard.In Iowa, she meets a man, falls in love, and believes her horrible, haunting memories of the past are completely behind her... but little does she know what's about to happen.  Little does she know her ex-husband is still out there, and searching for her once he finds out she's still alive.Sometimes the story goes through some slowdown time where no suspense or action takes place and instead focuses on Julia's love for her new boyfriend (with a few lengthy romantic bits included as well) but this is actually quite fine by me because it shows the viewer how willing Julia's character was to move on and leave the past behind her.  It looks believable too.  It makes you appreciate the suspense when it eventually does happen.  The lengthy time at the end of the movie was a perfect example how to make a suspenseful storyline.  Don't give too much away too early.The acting is phenomenal all around, and the storytelling is quite good too.  It's just really amazing how GOOD the movie looks after all these years.

Ulike the &quot;women's pictures&quot; of the 30's and 40's,starring the likes of Katherine Hepburn, Bette Davis and JoanCrawford, which featured strong women confronting and overcoming a lot of conflict, &quot;Julia Roberts vehicles&quot; fall generally into two groups: There's the romantic comedy, which is usually a shameless retelling of the Cinderella myth, like &quot;Pretty Woman,&quot;or there's the shameless feminist propaganda vehicle, like this one.  In the latter vehicle, all men are beasts, and even the good ones are not redeemed until they finally learn to submit to Julia's will.In this movie, Julia plays the spunky beleagured wife of the husband-from-hell, played by Patrick Bergin.  Bergin's character is such a control-freak, he's almost as manipulative as this movie is.  One day, Julia fakes her own death in a swimming accident, and runs away, back to her childhood home in the Midwestto start a new life.  It's a bit amazing in the way the filmmakersexpect you to believe that husband-from-hell is bright enough to figure out there's something wrong with his wife's &quot;death,&quot; but takes 2/3 of the movie to figure out where she's gone.  No matter, that gives our heroine time to start a relationship with a somewhat nerdy, non-threatening, &quot;liberated&quot; male played by Kevin Anderson.The real surprise of this movie (and perhaps the only one) is the way it engages your interest in spite of how obviously manipulative it is.  Julia has a lot to do with this, always conveying just the right combination of spirited spunk with disarming vulnerablity.  Best part of the picture?  The use ofthe &quot;Witches' Sabbath&quot; movement from Berlioz' &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot; to set up the final confrontation between the forcesof good and evil.

It just popped up on my radar so I thought I'd revisit it. The good parts were better than I'd remembered, but the bad stuff was still bad.Here's the scoop. Julia Roberts is married to a very wealthy Patrick Bergin. They have a beautiful house on the cape. He's a real anal retentive control freak. She is one of the things he likes to control. He's overly suspicious and beats her when he doesn't like something she's done. She fakes her own death through drowning, slips away to Iowa, meets a cool and nice guy and thinks she might have pulled it off. Wouldn't be much of a movie were that true.Up until the time she makes her getaway this is done really well. There are a lot of nice touches showing how a marriage like this should be idyllic but is not. Bergin is a truly scary dude. Her ruse is clever and you root for her. When she hits Iowa, some things are good. She's still jumpy and has a hard time with trust. Then when things start to heat up between her and her new beau it gets a bit too cute. Then when hubby tracks her down it gets a bit stupid. He might be a monster but he's not a moron and he does some really stupid things here. This was dumb at the script level.Joe Ruben will never be considered a great director. He shows a certain efficiency here. Nice camera work and lighting. I think he needed to lean on the writer a bit more to clean up the script. All the other production values are pro level. The music score is fitting. The performances are generally good though Bergin is a bit over the top. He's too much the monster. This is a good, decent watch. It's fun seeing a young, fresh Julia Roberts early in her career.

295278,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,6302096227,Jason,"[3, 3]","After realizing her wealthy husband isn't quite the perfect man, Laura (Julia Roberts) is driven to desperation.  Her husband Martin (Patrick Bergin) is a collector.  He has a great car, an awesome job, a massively luxurious house on the beach, and Laura serves as a trophy wife.  Unfortunately for Laura, however, Martin also happens to be psychotic, and he has one of the worst cases of OCD on the planet.  He wants Laura to look a certain way, act a certain way, and most importantly, clean/organize the house to his liking.  The canned food should have all labels facing outward, the bed must bounce a quarter, and the towels have to be even on the rack down to the thread; she's in a wife's version of Basic Training.What to do?  Laura plans her incognito aquatic escape aided by an altered appearance.  Thanks to the YMCA, she disappears from Martin and reinvents herself Sara.  Making her way to Iowa, she's scared on a daily basis by things like trains, whistles, aligned medicine cabinets, baseball diamonds in corn fields, and freshly creased sheets.  When she meets a limp noodle drama professor named Ben Woodward (Kevin Anderson) - the anti-Martin - the demented love triangle is set for the ""surprise"" showdown.The pacing is done fairly well, and the scares are believable.  The character development is minimal, but it's just enough to build trust and support for Laura, pitting absolutely everyone against Martin (mostly because of his abuse, but partially because of his molestache).  The concept reversal is tenuous at best, but it serves as a setup for Laura's freedom attained through her triumph over vulnerability - her new lease on life.Director Joseph Ruben weaves a well-structured and paced film.  At no point is there a lull without intensity, and conversely it is never overly ridiculous (despite moments of implausibility).  I think that the messages within are as much about audience manipulation as they are abuse (considering that nobody feels bad about a blatant murder being crucial to the climax), but it's a solid suspense thriller sure to keep viewers on the edge of the seat...or at least until Julia calls the cops, ""Hello, 911?""",4,FIX THE STINKING TOWELS!,1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,2168,"['realizing', 'wealthy', 'husband', ""n't"", 'quite', 'perfect', 'man', 'Laura', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'driven', 'desperation', 'husband', 'Martin', 'Patrick', 'Bergin', 'collector', 'great', 'car', 'awesome', 'job', 'massively', 'luxurious', 'house', 'beach', 'Laura', 'trophy', 'wife', 'Unfortunately', 'Laura', 'however', 'Martin', 'also', 'be', 'psychotic', 'one', 'worst', 'cases', 'OCD', 'planet', 'Laura', 'look', 'certain', 'way', 'act', 'certain', 'way', 'most', 'importantly', 'clean/organize', 'house', 'liking', 'canned', 'food', 'should', 'have', 'labels', 'facing', 'outward', 'bed', 'must', 'bounce', 'quarter', 'towels', 'have', 'be', 'even', 'rack', 'down', 'thread', 'wife', 'version', 'Basic', 'Training.What', 'do', 'Laura', 'incognito', 'aquatic', 'escape', 'aided', 'altered', 'appearance', 'Thanks', 'YMCA', 'Martin', 'reinvents', 'Sara', 'Making', 'way', 'Iowa', 'scared', 'daily', 'basis', 'things', 'trains', 'whistles', 'aligned', 'medicine', 'cabinets', 'baseball', 'diamonds', 'corn', 'fields', 'freshly', 'creased', 'sheets', 'When', 'limp', 'noodle', 'drama', 'professor', 'named', 'Ben', 'Woodward', 'Kevin', 'Anderson', 'anti-Martin', 'demented', 'love', 'triangle', 'set', 'surprise', 'showdown.The', 'pacing', 'done', 'fairly', 'well', 'scares', 'are', 'believable', 'character', 'development', 'minimal', 'just', 'enough', 'build', 'trust', 'support', 'Laura', 'pitting', 'absolutely', 'everyone', 'Martin', 'mostly', 'abuse', 'partially', 'molestache', 'concept', 'reversal', 'tenuous', 'best', 'setup', 'Laura', 'freedom', 'attained', 'triumph', 'vulnerability', 'new', 'lease', 'life.Director', 'Joseph', 'Ruben', 'well-structured', 'paced', 'film', 'point', 'lull', 'intensity', 'conversely', 'never', 'overly', 'ridiculous', 'moments', 'implausibility', 'think', 'messages', 'are', 'much', 'audience', 'manipulation', 'are', 'abuse', 'considering', 'nobody', 'feels', 'bad', 'blatant', 'murder', 'being', 'crucial', 'climax', 'solid', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'sure', 'keep', 'viewers', 'edge', 'seat', 'least', 'Julia', 'cops', 'Hello', '911']",N/A

Michael Click,"[0, 0]","It's bad enough that &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34; is totally predictable, with holes in the plot that are insultingly big and obvious.  What is truly terrible is that it wastes the talents of some incredibly gifted actors and filmmakers.Julia Roberts plays Laura, a woman who fakes her own death to escape the clutches of her monstrously abusive husband (Patrick Bergin).  She flees to a small town in the heartland, where she assumes a new identity and eventually falls in love with a gentle neighbor (Kevin Anderson).  Now, you'll never guess what happens next!  (Or maybe you will.)  Could it be that her husband picks up her trail and comes after her?  Naw ... that would be too cliche, wouldn't it?  And how does he figure out she's alive?  Oh, surely not because she actually left clues behind that are the equivalent of giant neon signs saying &#34;Hey!  I'm still alive and I ran away from you!&#34;  So guess how the story ends ...?  Oh, never mind, you won't catch me ruining any &#34;surprises.&#34;This movie might never have been released if it didn't star the luminous Miss Roberts, who manages to hold the audience's attention through the force of her legendary on-screen charisma.  She's helped immensely by the intensely likeable performance of Kevin Anderson, a dazzling actor whose failure to achieve major stardom is both inexplicable and lamentable.  Patrick Bergin is unable to do much with the hateful husband, but his failure has less to do with his natural talent than it does with the role, which is both one-dimensional and underwritten.  John W. Lindley's beautiful and moody cinematography is a huge plus.Despite is amateurish failings, &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34; was a huge hit at the box office.  20th Century-Fox was astute enough to release it in February of 1991, just after Miss Roberts had received a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her work in the smash hit, &#34;Pretty Woman.&#34;  The blu-ray release offers a solid transfer of the film, but precious little in terms of bonus features ... only a short featurette from the time of the film's original release and the original theatrical trailer.  It's interesting, and instructive, to note how the film was marketed: as a Julia Roberts vehicle that in addition to displaying her megawatt smile, also happened to be a thriller.  Recommended, with reservations, to fans of Roberts and Anderson.

A riveting psychological horror suspense thriller that stars Julia Roberts, Patrick Bergin, Kevin Anderson, and Elizabeth Lawrence.  This movie has its flaws, such as plot holes and things that don't make sense (I'll spare you the details, just discover them on your own), but overall it's an entertaining ""horror"" movie.  The standout performance in this movie is by Patrick Bergin, who plays Martin Burney, the super-tidy husband of Laura, played by Julia Roberts.  He's one creepy villain.  In my opinion, he's one of the great villains in movie history.  This movie is very suspenseful and scary at times.  It has a dose of irony as well, such as when the super-tidy Martin ends up making a mess of his own house after he discovers that his wife has faked her death.  The house the couple has on Cape Cod is cool.The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is good.  I don't like the inclusion of the Van Morrison song Brown Eyed Girl.  To me, it disrupts and changes the mood of the movie, even if it's just for a few minutes.

Laura has painstakingly planned her escape, knowing that if he finds her she's dead. She rebuilds her life in Iowa, where she's secreted away her mother and she begins to live an almost haphazard life, reveling in the fact that no one can tell her what to do. What she didn't plan for was her future, having no forged paperwork to get a new job and not even having established a new name. But this being a movie, everything works out for the best, and Laura (now Sarah) even begins seeing one of her neighbors. Only of course her husband finds her and she's forced to fight him one last time--this time for her life.Sleeping with the Enemy is from the early 90s when Julia Roberts had established herself as America's sweetheart.

295295,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,6302096227,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[6, 10]","'Sleeping With The Enemy' was the movie meant to change Julia Roberts from cute into serious actress.  Little did she know it but that wasn't to come for another ten years with 'Erin Brockavich' (where both she and the film are excellent).  But the problem with this movie isn't the acting, far from it both Roberts and Bergin are both fine, but the way it takes a familiar subject and treats it in such a boring and disrespectful fashion.It starts off well, with a seemingly idyllic marriage: Laura (Roberts) is fishing for clams on the beach, they've got a gorgeous house by the sea and Roberts basically looks the part of the beautiful wife.  However, things start going downhill as soon as hubby starts beating up his wife and Laura hops a bus out of town with a new identity.  Right from the very start you can see what's going to happen.  Anyone who's watched a few of these movie's knows that when we're told Laura can't swim that it's going to pop up as a plot later on, or that when she flushes her ring down the toilet her husband is going to find it later and realise that she's not really dead.As soon as Laura leaves to start her new life things take an inexplicable change of pace as she romances sickly drama teacher Ben.  She bakes apple pie for him and there's a montage where she tries on hats.  Wasn't this Roberts trying to prove herself?  The audience is certainly likely to forget that here, with Laura putting up only minimal resistance to Ben's advances.  Worse still we're not given a glimpse of why Laura stayed with him for all these years other than being told that he didn't used to be like this.After the interlude however we're back into revenge drama as Laura's psychotic husband tracks her down to a market town in Iowa.  Unfortunately his revenge seems to mostly consist of straigtening towels in her bathroom and rearranging cans in the cupboard.  Any hint of psychological drama is almost entirely down to the actors themselves, who are left pretty much to defend for themselves with an unoriginal script that both looks and feels like a TV drama.",2,Without Julia Roberts this wouldn't even register,1024099200,"06 15, 2002",2002,2083,"[""'Sleeping"", 'Enemy', 'was', 'movie', 'meant', 'change', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'cute', 'serious', 'actress', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'come', 'ten', 'years', ""'Erin"", 'Brockavich', 'where', 'film', 'are', 'excellent', 'problem', 'movie', ""n't"", 'acting', 'far', 'Roberts', 'Bergin', 'are', 'fine', 'way', 'familiar', 'subject', 'boring', 'disrespectful', 'fashion.It', 'off', 'well', 'seemingly', 'idyllic', 'marriage', 'Laura', 'Roberts', 'fishing', 'clams', 'beach', ""'ve"", 'got', 'gorgeous', 'house', 'sea', 'Roberts', 'basically', 'part', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'However', 'things', 'start', 'going', 'downhill', 'as', 'soon', 'hubby', 'beating', 'up', 'wife', 'Laura', 'bus', 'town', 'new', 'identity', 'Right', 'very', 'start', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'few', 'movie', 'knows', 'when', ""'re"", 'told', 'Laura', 'ca', ""n't"", 'swim', 'going', 'pop', 'up', 'plot', 'later', 'when', 'ring', 'down', 'toilet', 'husband', 'going', 'find', 'later', 'realise', 'not', 'really', 'dead.As', 'soon', 'Laura', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'things', 'take', 'inexplicable', 'change', 'pace', 'sickly', 'drama', 'teacher', 'Ben', 'apple', 'pie', 'montage', 'where', 'hats', 'Was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'prove', 'audience', 'certainly', 'likely', 'forget', 'here', 'Laura', 'putting', 'up', 'only', 'minimal', 'resistance', 'Ben', 'advances', 'Worse', 'still', ""'re"", 'not', 'given', 'glimpse', 'why', 'Laura', 'stayed', 'years', 'other', 'being', 'told', 'did', ""n't"", 'used', 'be', 'this.After', 'interlude', 'however', ""'re"", 'back', 'revenge', 'drama', 'Laura', 'psychotic', 'husband', 'down', 'market', 'town', 'Iowa', 'Unfortunately', 'revenge', 'mostly', 'consist', 'straigtening', 'towels', 'bathroom', 'rearranging', 'cans', 'cupboard', 'hint', 'psychological', 'drama', 'almost', 'entirely', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'left', 'pretty', 'much', 'defend', 'unoriginal', 'script', 'looks', 'feels', 'TV', 'drama']",N/A

295298,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,6302096227,Noirdame,"[10, 13]","Although primarily a showcase for Julia Roberts, who had become Hollywood's latest ""IT"" girl after ""Pretty Woman"", this romantic thriller, based on Nancy Price's novel, is watchable and quite suspenseful. It cannot be denied that the book is far superior, as is the case with most film adaptations based on a best-selling novel. The film is obviously aimed at women and the ""yuppie"" attitude that was still prevalent in the early 1990s. In the book, the abusive husband and wife were middle-class, while in the film Martin Burney (Patrick Bergin) is a wealthy businessman, who places his beautiful wife on a shelf like a trophy, expecting perfection and exploding when she doesn't meet his qualifications. While many may argue the change in their financial status in the movie, it does show that domestic violence can happen at every economic level, in all different walks of life and societies. We are only subjected to one instance where Laura (Roberts) is beaten by her spouse, although his control over her, demands and insensitivity to her feelings has been hinted at, and she does indicate that it was definitely not the first time. The novel goes into far more graphic detail of his offenses. Sara (the names that Roberts assumes are reversed in the book) wears a wig constantly after she escapes to Iowa, while the movie only has Laura wearing a wig as she escapes, and then she has her hair trimmed a little shorter and gets a perm. Not a very effective disguise if you're trying to alter your physical appearance so the bad guy won't recognize you! When she tosses her wedding ring in the toilet and tries unsuccessfully to flush it down the drain, Martin finds it after he tears through Laura's personal belongings and cuts himself, he discovers it with no problem - did he not use the toilet in the weeks since Laura's ""death""? Faking her demise, since her husband believes that she could not swim (she secretly took lessons at the YWCA, who inadvertently tips psycho hubby off - how did they find him?), she finds an ideal guy, Ben Woodward (Kevin Anderson), the local college drama professor, who embodies the sensitive, artistic dreamboat with such naturalness that you cannot help but like him. He gets her to open up (at least as far as she is capable of doing) and he senses that she is very traumatized, and is there for her when she most needs him. Anderson has rarely been seen since and I wonder what became of him - he certainly had the talent (anyone who can even partially pull off the opening number from ""West Side Story"" with a garden hose in tow and make it look easy must have something special), and the sequences featuring Van Morrison's Brown-Eyed Girl, and the vintage 60s tune Runaround Sue is actually quite engaging, a break from the intensity of the plot and showing some light-hearted, romantic fun.Bergin is effective if somewhat hammy in some parts - his character, no doubt, had some kind of undiagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder, but at times he's a little too wild-eyed, but he does have the charm masking brutality bit down quite good, as many violent offenders are skilled at presenting as a front (how can such a charming, wealthy man be such a monster in private?). Bergin, a latecomer to acting (he was a teacher for children with learning disabilities in his native Ireland), has played many villainous roles, although here it was obvious that the filmmakers were trying to get him to resemble a certain dictator (guess who!). And the fact that he seems to be able to slip in and out of her home (and rearrange her towels and condiments) without her knowing is definitely stretching it, something that Robert De Niro's character in the 1991 remake of ""Cape Fear"" also seemed to excel at, and Martin seems to have it too easy when tracking down his frail mother-in-law in the nursing home that Laura secretly placed her in after lying to Martin about her mother's fictional passing.Laura is a terrified woman driven to desperation, who wants to start a new life but she is still living in fear of the man she married, who she fears (and rightly so) will stop at nothing to find her if he discovers that she has escaped him. It's nauseating when he calls her his ""princess"", which again, seems to indicate that she is more of a possession to him, and I wasn't particularly interested in seeing Martin's backside after he ravishes her to Berlioz's ""Symphonie Le Fantasique"". The cinematography is breathtaking.The final showdown, terrifying and voyeuristic (the viewer, of course, is aware of the danger lurking in the shadows far before Laura and Ben are), and it's last resort for this young woman who found that the law could not protect her. Of course, the brief, the bad guy comes back from death momentarily part is ridiculous and clich&eacute;d, but when Laura embraces the injured Ben and the camera pulls back, showing the dead Martin, eyes open, his blood streaked hand, with Laura's gold wedding band just a few inches way, sparkling, is very compelling. The music, by Jerry Goldsmith is great, conveying sadness, terror and romance in equal amounts.Read the book, watch the film, and draw your own conclusions.",3,"Flawed, But Engrossing",1157846400,"09

Leaves the viewer with an unsatisfied feeling, as if you could have just read the screenplay instead of watching the movie and you would come away the same for it. This is one of those obligatory heroin-escapes-abuser (and kicks his butt) flicks that it seems every great actress has made. Not that I am not all for any woman in real life who does so, mind you, but I think there has to be a more to the story in terms of the plot in order to make it worthwhile, and this one falls short.

Beautiful woman manages to get gun away from ex-husband, shoots him dead and calls 911. Or maybe she calls 911 and then shoots him dead? (can't remember, doesn't matter). Beautiful woman and new beau live happily ever after.The end.Oh, the only thing not mentioned above that you might miss is the food (I'm a movie-foodie) that the characters dined on.

But I cannot recall a film around the time of this picture's premier where the subject played such a central role in the plot.  Unfortunately, the film doesn't offer many more unique aspects as it regresses into the standard thriller and stands just a step away from becoming just another slasher film.  Nevertheless, Julia Roberts played the abused spouse who's seeking to escape quite well and Patrick Bergin is her equal as the abusive, cruel, OCD-afflicted husband.  However, the film has little beyond that in originality.  Just move some of the characters around and you'd have ""Witness"".  Move them around again and you'd have ""The Fugitive"".  It's sad that such a difficult and serious subject that affects so many people isn't given more effort in Hollywood.  The leads were great and Kevin Anderson was descent as Roberts' character's new boyfriend.  Some of the plot points were interesting, but the plot as a whole was pretty bland.

Julia is great, as always, and the transition of her character is totally believable. Joseph Ruben has crafted a very fine suspense film, that I find myself watching over and over. I take issue with others who said the Van Morrison &quot;interlude&quot; was wrong. I thought it was a tension-reliever, as well as a chance to see the budding relationship between Julia and Kevin Anderson. Julia is confident and sure, and is everything we expect. The real moving factor here is the (almost) over-acting of Patrick Bergin, a real mean individual. He counters everything that might be nice. I still think the most overlooked facet of this film is the wonderful score by Jerry Goldsmith, a giant among film composers. Whatever you think, it all works for me. I like this film a lot.

(Any abused man or woman will probably be mesmerized by some of the scenes and the feelings evoked in this intense movie.)The new lifestyle she slowly, but surely creates for herself, against the backdrop of her husband piecing together her escape and his savage determination to find her creates a savvy suspense thriller that could be a classic in anyone's home movie library.",5,Scissor-Cut Look at Abuse,987811200,"04 21, 2001",2001,864,"['beginning', 'scene', 'quot', 'Sleeping', 'Enemy', 'quot', 'nice', 'handsome', 'husband', 'beautiful', 'smiling', 'wife', 'living', 'lovely', 'rich', 'house', 'movie', 'soon', 'stereotype', 'perception', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'showing', 'everything', 'glitters', 'not', 'necessarily', 'gold.Julia', 'Roberts', 'combination', 'sense', 'planning', 'cleverness', 'fear', 'hope', 'desperate', 'will', 'survive', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'faking', 'own', 'death', 'abused', 'man', 'woman', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'mesmerized', 'scenes', 'feelings', 'evoked', 'intense', 'movie', 'new', 'lifestyle', 'slowly', 'surely', 'backdrop', 'husband', 'piecing', 'together', 'escape', 'savage', 'determination', 'find', 'savvy', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'could', 'be', 'classic', 'anyone', 'home', 'movie', 'library']",N/A
