However, to my surprise, the movie is not about vampires, but instead about the eternal struggle that men are confronted with--temptation.  Bond portrays a minister &quot;to-be&quot; who comes from a long line of ministers.  Struggling with the question as to whether there is more to life than the ministry, he visits his childhood friend, Hardison, who is a struggling &quot;B&quot; movie actor in New York.  Little did he know that he would encounter a demon temptress named, you guessed it, Temptation, who, like the reviewer stated, is single-handedly destroying the men from a local &quot;pick-up&quot; joint.What makes this movie interesting is also what makes it a little campy. The seductress plays on the main sexual deviations of men: each concluding with real, and relevant, endings to the perpetrators.  The real storyline poses the question, &quot;Can you resist Temptation in this life to do what God requires of you?&quot; This is a question which is posed bluntly, and those who answer no, meet gruesome ends.Overall, the storyline is good, the acting decent, and Cynthia Bond as the temptress is hot.  This is overall a good movie and well worth viewing.",4,"Decent Movie, Deals with Real Struggles",955238400,"04 9, 2000",2000,1317,"['avid', 'fan', 'movies', 'vampire', 'genre', 'wasimmediately', 'drawn', 'one', 'based', 'detailed', 'review', 'AndrewWright', 'Amazon.com', 'However', 'surprise', 'movie', 'not', 'vampires', 'instead', 'eternal', 'struggle', 'men', 'are', 'confronted', 'temptation', 'Bond', 'minister', 'quot', 'to-be', 'quot', 'who', 'long', 'line', 'ministers', 'Struggling', 'question', 'more', 'life', 'ministry', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Hardison', 'who', 'struggling', 'quot', 'B', 'quot', 'movie', 'actor', 'New', 'York', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'would', 'encounter', 'demon', 'temptress', 'named', 'guessed', 'Temptation', 'who', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'single-handedly', 'destroying', 'men', 'local', 'quot', 'pick-up', 'quot', 'movie', 'interesting', 'also', 'what', 'little', 'campy', 'seductress', 'main', 'sexual', 'deviations', 'men', 'concluding', 'real', 'relevant', 'endings', 'perpetrators', 'real', 'storyline', 'question', 'quot', 'Can', 'resist', 'Temptation', 'life', 'do', 'what', 'God', 'quot', 'question', 'posed', 'bluntly', 'who', 'answer', 'meet', 'gruesome', 'ends.Overall', 'storyline', 'good', 'acting', 'decent', 'Cynthia', 'Bond', 'temptress', 'hot', 'overall', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing']",N/A

An out-of-town college student named Joel (James Bond III) as he meets an actor friend of his named K (Kadeem Harisdan) for advice including having a good time in the big city, a detective is searching for the murderer who's commited the bizarre crimes and K is falling for the seductive tempress but how old before he finds out her real self.An outstanding and original urban vampire tale that has became a cult favorite and is one of Troma's theatrically released critically acclaimed movies. Writer/rapper/director/producer/star James Bond III and company have created a modern urban flavored supernatural tale that has became one of the most underrated vampire movies ever and one of my faves since high school. Samuel L Jackson does one of his earliest film appearences before being big as he plays the vampire killing preacher who is one of the film's highlights. There is sex and gore in this movie with great atmosphere, a cool old school R&B; and hip-hop soundtrack, and a throw back to 70's blaxploitation horror movies all successfuly done.This re-issue DVD has great picture and sound with trailer, interviews, introduction and that's all.Also recommended: ""The Hunger"", ""Vamp"", ""Fright Night 1 & 2"", ""Let The Right One In"", ""Lifeforce"", ""Dracula (1931 and sequels)"", ""Underworld Trilogy"", ""The Lost Boys"", ""Blacula"", ""Martin"", ""Daybreakers"", ""Demons"", ""Suspiria"", ""Vampire Lovers"", ""Countess Dracula"", ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer (Movie and show)"", ""Near Dark"", ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", ""Subspecies"", ""Cat People (1982)"", ""Vampire Hunter D 1 & 2"", ""Blood The Last Vampire (Live-action and anime)"", ""Horror of Dracula (Plus sequels)"", ""Sleepwalkers"", ""30 Days of Night"", ""John Carpenter's Vampires"", ""Immortality (Wisdom of Crocodiles)"", ""Interview with the Vampire"", ""Queen of the Damned"", ""Perfect Creature"", ""Modern Vampires"", ""Perfect Creature"", ""Twilight 1 & 2"", ""An American Werewolf in London"", ""The Monster Squad"", ""Tales from The Hood"", ""The Keep"", ""Lair of the White Worm"", ""Thirst"", ""Once Bitten"", ""Innocent Blood"", ""Blade Trilogy"", ""Daughters of Darkness"", and ""The Forsaken"".",5,Excellent vampire thriller from Troma!,1195430400,"11 19, 2007",2007,2316,"['New', 'York', 'City', 'sexy', 'temptress', 'Cynthia', 'Bond', 'men', 'bars', 'sex', 'dapartment', 'then', 'be', 'vampiress/succubus', 'creature', 'who', 'drain', 'blood', 'energy', 'men', 'out-of-town', 'college', 'student', 'named', 'Joel', 'James', 'Bond', 'III', 'actor', 'friend', 'named', 'K', 'Kadeem', 'Harisdan', 'advice', 'including', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'big', 'city', 'detective', 'searching', 'murderer', 'who', 'commited', 'bizarre', 'crimes', 'K', 'falling', 'seductive', 'tempress', 'how', 'old', 'out', 'real', 'self.An', 'outstanding', 'original', 'urban', 'vampire', 'tale', 'became', 'cult', 'favorite', 'one', 'Troma', 'theatrically', 'released', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'movies', 'Writer/rapper/director/producer/star', 'James', 'Bond', 'III', 'company', 'have', 'created', 'modern', 'urban', 'flavored', 'supernatural', 'tale', 'became', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'vampire', 'movies', 'ever', 'one', 'faves', 'high', 'school', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'one', 'earliest', 'film', 'appearences', 'being', 'big', 'vampire', 'killing', 'preacher', 'who', 'one', 'film', 'highlights', 'sex', 'gore', 'movie', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'cool', 'old', 'school', 'R', 'B', 'hip-hop', 'soundtrack', 'throw', 'back', '70', 'blaxploitation', 'horror', 'movies', 'successfuly', 'done.This', 're-issue', 'DVD', 'great', 'picture', 'sound', 'trailer', 'interviews', 'introduction', 'all.Also', 'recommended', 'Hunger', 'Vamp', 'Fright', 'Night', '1', '2', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'Lifeforce', 'Dracula', '1931', 'sequels', 'Underworld', 'Trilogy', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Blacula', 'Martin', 'Daybreakers', 'Demons', 'Suspiria', 'Vampire', 'Lovers', 'Countess', 'Dracula', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Movie', 'show', 'Dark', 'Dusk', 'Till', 'Dawn', 'Subspecies', 'Cat', 'People', '1982', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'D', '1', '2', 'Blood', 'Last', 'Vampire', 'Live-action', 'anime', 'Horror', 'Dracula', 'Plus', 'sequels', 'Sleepwalkers', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Vampires', 'Immortality', 'Wisdom', 'Crocodiles', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'Perfect', 'Creature', 'Modern', 'Vampires', 'Perfect', 'Creature', 'Twilight', '1', '2', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'Monster', 'Squad', 'Tales', 'Hood', 'Keep', 'Lair', 'White', 'Worm', 'Thirst', 'Once', 'Bitten', 'Innocent', 'Blood', 'Blade', 'Trilogy', 'Daughters', 'Darkness', 'Forsaken']",N/A

With the help of an undercover agent, they must work together to defeat the creature before it destroys them as well. From the notorious Troma studios and released in 1990, ""Def By Temptation"" is probably one of their better films, but it still is overall a clearly amateur effort. Not bad, but not great, and I felt it dragged a lot here and there. It's considered noteworthy as the first all black horror film since the ""blaxploitation"" era, and it's not as campy as that stuff was, but a little more humor or other form of excitement might have been helpful I think, because at times it seems too slow and tedious to me. As something touted as a Samuel L. Jackson vehicle, that may seem hard to believe, but the truth is, he is hardly in the film at all. Even Kadeem Hardison isn't the main character, as that role goes to the film's creator/director, James Bond III. Also starring in this one are Bill Nunn and, as the evil temptress, Cynthia Bond. And, as for the man-eating demon creature she portrays, when the film is talked about, she is sometimes described as a succubus and often as a vampire. Personally, I have never understood a succubus and a vampire to be the same creature. Even in this film, this creature didn't really come off as a vampire to me. The film is all about temptation and having the strength to resist it. That is definitely what I understand succubi to be all about, and I really have to disagree with the idea that this film is a vampire film. Like ""The Devil's Nightmare"", I believe the creature in this film is a succubus demon and NOT a vampire. Anyway, overall, this film is okay if you don't mind super-low budget stuff. At its core, it's a decent story. Seems like most of the scenes take place in three locales though, so it feels a bit claustrophobic. There's the bar, there's the succubus's apartment, and there's the apartment of Kadeem's character. This kind of adds to the feeling that the movie is a little tedious.The DVD from Troma has some decent extras, if nothing very meaty. You do get the theatrical trailer, along with other trailers, and there's an intro by Troma President Lloyd Kaufman. The commentaries mentioned on the case by Mike Mayo and Michael Gingold aren't feature commentaries, just brief footage of the people in question commenting about the film. There's a Troma trivia game as well, and stills, and some advertisement type stuff. One of the most interesting extras is ""Scenes from the Tromaville Cafe TV Show"", hosted by a pretty cute character named Melvina. For such a low budget feature, this is a pretty decent release, though it is also a fullscreen release and not super great quality or anything, but I have no clue how this film actually is supposed to look at its best, so... maybe this is as good as it gets.",3,"Okay LOW budget horror, but there was just something I didn't like about the pacing...",1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,2967,"['When', 'pure', 'innocent', 'young', 'man', 'road', 'becoming', 'preacher', 'actor', 'friend', 'city', 'two', 'discover', 'evil', 'succubus', 'preying', 'men', 'local', 'bar', 'help', 'undercover', 'agent', 'must', 'work', 'together', 'defeat', 'creature', 'as', 'well', 'notorious', 'Troma', 'studios', 'released', '1990', 'Def', 'Temptation', 'probably', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'still', 'overall', 'clearly', 'amateur', 'effort', 'Not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'felt', 'dragged', 'lot', 'here', 'there', 'considered', 'noteworthy', 'first', 'black', 'horror', 'film', 'blaxploitation', 'era', 'not', 'as', 'campy', 'stuff', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'humor', 'other', 'form', 'excitement', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'think', 'because', 'times', 'too', 'slow', 'tedious', 'something', 'touted', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'vehicle', 'may', 'seem', 'hard', 'believe', 'truth', 'hardly', 'film', 'Even', 'Kadeem', 'Hardison', ""n't"", 'main', 'character', 'role', 'film', 'creator/director', 'James', 'Bond', 'III', 'Also', 'starring', 'one', 'are', 'Bill', 'Nunn', 'evil', 'temptress', 'Cynthia', 'Bond', 'man-eating', 'demon', 'creature', 'when', 'film', 'talked', 'sometimes', 'described', 'succubus', 'often', 'vampire', 'Personally', 'have', 'never', 'understood', 'succubus', 'vampire', 'be', 'same', 'creature', 'Even', 'film', 'creature', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'off', 'vampire', 'film', 'temptation', 'having', 'strength', 'resist', 'definitely', 'what', 'understand', 'succubi', 'be', 'really', 'have', 'disagree', 'idea', 'film', 'vampire', 'film', 'Devil', 'Nightmare', 'believe', 'creature', 'film', 'succubus', 'demon', 'NOT', 'vampire', 'Anyway', 'overall', 'film', 'okay', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'super-low', 'budget', 'stuff', 'core', 'decent', 'story', 'most', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'three', 'locales', 'bit', 'claustrophobic', 'bar', 'succubus', 'apartment', 'apartment', 'Kadeem', 'character', 'kind', 'feeling', 'movie', 'little', 'tedious.The', 'DVD', 'Troma', 'decent', 'extras', 'nothing', 'very', 'meaty', 'do', 'get', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'other', 'trailers', 'intro', 'Troma', 'President', 'Lloyd', 'Kaufman', 'commentaries', 'mentioned', 'case', 'Mike', 'Mayo', 'Michael', 'Gingold', 'are', ""n't"", 'feature', 'commentaries', 'just', 'brief', 'footage', 'people', 'question', 'commenting', 'film', 'Troma', 'trivia', 'game', 'as', 'well', 'stills', 'advertisement', 'type', 'stuff', 'One', 'most', 'interesting', 'extras', 'Scenes', 'Tromaville', 'Cafe', 'TV', 'Show', 'hosted', 'pretty', 'cute', 'character', 'named', 'Melvina', 'such', 'low', 'budget', 'feature', 'pretty', 'decent', 'release', 'also', 'fullscreen', 'release', 'not', 'super', 'great', 'quality', 'anything', 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'film', 'actually', 'supposed', 'look', 'best', 'so', 'maybe', 'as', 'good']",N/A

437772,ABYNIQUEMDKY6,630485241X,Steve Miller,"[4, 6]","'Def by Temptation' is the tale of a young preacher-in-training (James Bond III, who also wrote and directed the flick) who takes a break from his studies to spend time with his childhood friend (Kadeem Hardison) in NYC,  obstensibly to get to know a little about the world. He gets a little more  than he bargains for, as he gets caught in the web of a demoness who is  single-handedly depopulating a pick-up joint. (The demon preys on human  weaknesses, such as lust and greed.) The big question: Will the young  preacher remain pure and alive, or will he join the demon's list of  victims?Pacing- and story-wise, this is a standard B-Movie. It's a touch  more upscale/serious than a typical Troma release, but it still has its  share of humorous moments. The cinematography and lighting is above  average... and there's actually a bit of acting going on in a number of  scenes! (James Bond III is not one of the highlights, unfortunately.) There  are a number of confused moments in the storyline, but none are fatally  distracting, so, all in all, this is a fun romp.Note for Samuel L.  Jackson fans: Jackson's character is actually rather important to a number  of the elements of the plot, but its hardly 'truth in advertising' to list  him among the film's stars.

She wasn't overacting or cheesy like some blacksploitation moves were.  She was smooth and it was the first and last film that I have seen her in.  You can tell it was a fledglings first film, but he had a lot of rising new stars in it.  It was well written, comical on some levels, and definitely not for young children. It taught a good lesson in my eyes.  The lesson was , ""All the glitters is not gold.""  I just love vampire movies. I always have, well before Twilight.
