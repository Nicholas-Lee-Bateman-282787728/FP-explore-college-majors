517099,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B0000399WJ,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 3]","From screenplay, to cinematography, and most certainly through the exceptional performances, this superb film is a tearjerker you can feel good about - on many levels.The movie's most compelling quality is its clear-eyed view of racism in America's deep south.  The black people we meet all have distinct personalities complete with problems, strengths, fears, disappointments, and ambitions - just like anybody else.  They are people first, black people second.  Racism, in all of its cruel and unjust stupidity, does not define them; it is simply the water they swim in, the air they breathe.  This unbiased neutrality imbues A Lesson Before Dying with real force.Every life is seen through the lens of racism.  Jefferson (Mekhi Phifer) is the purest of victims, Grant (Don Cheadle) is the intellectual wrestling with fight or flight, Tante Lou (Cicely Tyson) is fierce in her belief that self-discipline holds the answer, while the unforgettable Miss Emma (Irma Hall) embodies all we've ever learned about the abiding courage and astounding endurance of black women, still strong enough to love, give, and do what it takes to defend their own.This is a tough-minded picture that asks a very hard question.  Everyone knows Jefferson is innocent, they also know he will be executed.  But how can Grant help him die with dignity?  Why is that such an important goal - a gift to himself, to Miss Emma, and to the children of the town?  This quest touches everyone.Don Cheadle is always worth watching, he was haunting in Hotel Rwanda.  The good news is that his exceptional performance here is one of many that are woven together into a powerful, and very American story.  Highly recommended.",5,"""I'm happy, tonight.

517105,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000399WJ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[33, 36]","In Louisiana in 1948 a young black man named Jefferson (Mekhi Phifer) makes the fatal mistake of accepting a ride from another pair of young men.  When they stop at a local store to get some beer the other men do not have enough money and the white storeowner will not give them credit.  Guns are drawn and everybody ends up dead but Jefferson, who is arrested for the crime.  Since this is a question of black and white justice in the South before the Civil Rights Movement, Jefferson is condemned to be executed.  The fact that he is innocent of the actual killings is not important to this 1999 HBO movie adapted from the novel by Ernest J. Gaines (""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"").  Nobody is going to save Jefferson from his fate.  The focus here is not on justice, but rather on death with dignity.The key moment is not what happened in the store but rather what is said during the trial, when Jefferson's defense attorney, a white lawyer, seeks to save his client's life by saying that Jefferson is like a hog.  That is to say, as a Negro Jefferson is no more intelligent than a hog and not capable of understanding what he is doing, therefore he should not be convicted.  The jury, no doubt well acquainted with the practice of barbeque, has no more qualms about having Jefferson executed than they would of slaughtering a hog for a feast.  But Jefferson's mother, Miss Emma (Irma P. Hall), and his aunt Tante Lou (Cicely Tyson), are outraged that the boy has been called a hog.  So they badger local schoolteacher Grant Wiggins (Don Cheadle), the only educated black man in town, to visit Jefferson in jail and convince him that he is a man and not a hog.Now, this is certainly an interesting idea.  After all, the premise of white supremacy is that Negroes are not human, with the idea that they were property rather than people codified in the U.S. Constitution as well as implicit in the practice of slavery.  If Jefferson accepts this characterization, advanced by his own attorney and inherent in the social system in which he lives, then convincing him otherwise is a noble effort.  The flaw here is that I was not convinced that Jefferson thought he was a hog rather than a man.  Maybe my problem is that Jefferson is played by an actor who is playing a doctor on ""ER,"" not to mention the fact that I reject the idea of racial superiority or inferiority.  But since his family accepts the fact that the white justice system is going to kill Jefferson I would be inclined to think he would be of a similar mind and that he would not take his lawyer's simile to heart.  However, you really have to accept the premise or else the movie cannot have the requisite transformations at the end.""A Lesson Before Dying"" which won the 1999 Emmy for Outstanding Made for Television Movie, is one of those movies adapted from a novel where I have not read the book but I end up thinking the depth it provides probably fixes a lot of the film's shortcomings.  Obviously I think the fault is to be found in Ann Peacock's Emmy winning screenplay, because the performances by the cast and as good as you would expect them to be, but if you buy the story's premise from the beginning then you will not be having a major problem with director Joseph Sargent's film.  Given the Civil Rights Movement to come what becomes interesting is not so much the battle by Wiggins to communicate with Jefferson, but the conflict between the teacher and Reverend Ambrose (Brent Jennings) over what is best for the condemned young man.  Does death with dignity preclude salvation or does the quest for salvation require acceptance of your fate?Ultimately, the character who learns the most is Wiggins, as the teacher becomes the student.  Wiggins is a college educated black man in a place where few of either color get such formal education.  He resists being asked to do this task because it means going backwards, giving up some of his own dignity to go with hat in hand to ask the white men to be allowed to meet with Jefferson.  The fact that Wiggins wants to marry a light-skinned Negro woman becomes part of this equation as well, because ""A Lesson Before Dying"" indicts the schoolteacher for turning his back on his race (indeed, there is a scene where his remarks to his students are as demeaning as those of any of the white characters).  By the end of the film life with dignity is the goal.",4,There are more important lessons to be learned than death with dignity,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,4394,"['Louisiana', '1948', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'named', 'Jefferson', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'fatal', 'mistake', 'accepting', 'ride', 'pair', 'young', 'men', 'When', 'stop', 'local', 'store', 'get', 'beer', 'other', 'men', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'white', 'storeowner', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'credit', 'Guns', 'are', 'drawn', 'everybody', 'up', 'dead', 'Jefferson', 'who', 'arrested', 'crime', 'question', 'black', 'white', 'justice', 'South', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'Jefferson', 'condemned', 'be', 'executed', 'fact', 'innocent', 'actual', 'killings', 'not', 'important', '1999', 'HBO', 'movie', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Ernest', 'J.', 'Gaines', 'Autobiography', 'Miss', 'Jane', 'Pittman', 'Nobody', 'going', 'save', 'Jefferson', 'fate', 'focus', 'here', 'not', 'justice', 'rather', 'death', 'dignity.The', 'key', 'moment', 'not', 'what', 'happened', 'store', 'rather', 'what', 'said', 'trial', 'when', 'Jefferson', 'defense', 'attorney', 'white', 'lawyer', 'save', 'client', 'life', 'saying', 'Jefferson', 'hog', 'say', 'Negro', 'Jefferson', 'more', 'intelligent', 'hog', 'not', 'capable', 'understanding', 'what', 'doing', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'convicted', 'jury', 'doubt', 'well', 'acquainted', 'practice', 'barbeque', 'more', 'qualms', 'having', 'Jefferson', 'executed', 'would', 'slaughtering', 'hog', 'feast', 'Jefferson', 'mother', 'Miss', 'Emma', 'Irma', 'P.', 'Hall', 'aunt', 'Tante', 'Lou', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'are', 'outraged', 'boy', 'been', 'called', 'hog', 'badger', 'local', 'schoolteacher', 'Grant', 'Wiggins', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'only', 'educated', 'black', 'man', 'town', 'visit', 'Jefferson', 'jail', 'convince', 'man', 'not', 'hog.Now', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'idea', 'premise', 'white', 'supremacy', 'Negroes', 'are', 'not', 'human', 'idea', 'were', 'property', 'rather', 'people', 'codified', 'U.S.', 'Constitution', 'as', 'well', 'implicit', 'practice', 'slavery', 'Jefferson', 'characterization', 'advanced', 'own', 'attorney', 'inherent', 'social', 'system', 'then', 'convincing', 'otherwise', 'noble', 'effort', 'flaw', 'here', 'was', 'not', 'convinced', 'Jefferson', 'thought', 'was', 'hog', 'rather', 'man', 'Maybe', 'problem', 'Jefferson', 'played', 'actor', 'who', 'playing', 'doctor', 'ER', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'reject', 'idea', 'racial', 'superiority', 'inferiority', 'family', 'fact', 'white', 'justice', 'system', 'going', 'kill', 'Jefferson', 'would', 'be', 'inclined', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'similar', 'mind', 'would', 'not', 'take', 'lawyer', 'simile', 'heart', 'However', 'really', 'have', 'accept', 'premise', 'else', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'requisite', 'transformations', 'end', 'A', 'Lesson', 'Dying', 'won', '1999', 'Emmy', 'Outstanding', 'Made', 'Television', 'Movie', 'one', 'movies', 'adapted', 'novel', 'where', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'end', 'up', 'thinking', 'depth', 'probably', 'fixes', 'lot', 'film', 'shortcomings', 'Obviously', 'think', 'fault', 'be', 'found', 'Ann', 'Peacock', 'Emmy', 'winning', 'screenplay', 'performances', 'cast', 'as', 'good', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'buy', 'story', 'premise', 'beginning', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'having', 'major', 'problem', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Sargent', 'film', 'Given', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'come', 'what', 'interesting', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'battle', 'Wiggins', 'communicate', 'Jefferson', 'conflict', 'teacher', 'Reverend', 'Ambrose', 'Brent', 'Jennings', 'what', 'best', 'condemned', 'young', 'man', 'death', 'dignity', 'preclude', 'salvation', 'quest', 'salvation', 'require', 'acceptance', 'fate', 'Ultimately', 'character', 'who', 'most', 'Wiggins', 'teacher', 'student', 'Wiggins', 'college', 'educated', 'black', 'man', 'place', 'where', 'few', 'color', 'get', 'such', 'formal', 'education', 'being', 'asked', 'do', 'task', 'going', 'backwards', 'giving', 'up', 'own', 'dignity', 'go', 'hat', 'hand', 'ask', 'white', 'men', 'be', 'allowed', 'meet', 'Jefferson', 'fact', 'marry', 'light-skinned', 'Negro', 'woman', 'part', 'equation', 'as', 'well', 'A', 'Lesson', 'Dying', 'schoolteacher', 'turning', 'back', 'race', 'indeed', 'scene', 'where', 'remarks', 'students', 'are', 'as', 'demeaning', 'white', 'characters', 'end', 'film', 'life', 'dignity', 'goal']",N/A

You have to really be in the mood to see (or read) something that you know is going to irritate you to no end, and this was that type of film. While I wouldn't be able to stomach seeing it twice, it was an excellent film. I've read countless books in school about innocent men unjustly sent to Death Row or prison because of a racist jury, neglectful lawyers or without even being able to tell his story at all. In this film, Mekhi Phifer's character Jefferson was in an extremely awkward position. What the movie did was show the wrongs of the legal system as well as the wrongs of his so-called friends who pretty much set him up. The two black guys in this film with Jefferson were as wrong as the sheriff, the lawyer and the judge. But what's more important to the film is how the family deals with knowing that Jefferson is just not going to survive. It's bad enough to find out a family member will be doing prison time but to know he's definitely going to die is torture in itself, especially if you know he's innocent. In comes Grant Wiggins (played by Don Cheadle) who is forced into teaching him some educational tools. This part seemed pretty useless to both me and Grant, but I saw the reason for it by the end of the film.At some points the movie was just hard to watch. The chains he was put in reminded me (as it should) of slavery. The children coming in made him seem like a museum exhibit up until one particular girl did exactly what I (think I) would've done in that situation. Mekhi Phifer and Don Cheadle were great in this film, and I appreciated Mr. Wiggins being on the other side of religion to show that not all black people agree on faith. It was an interesting take on both sides of the coin. As expected, Irma P. Hall (who plays Miss Emma) and Cicely Tyson (who plays Tante Lou) were superb at their roles. Actually the entire cast held their own.

Nevertheless convicted, he is sentenced to die, but his godmother and the aunt of the local schoolteacher convince school teacher go to the convicted man's cell each day to try to reaffirm to him that he is not an animal but a man with dignity. This movie is very well done, superbly crafted, and the storytelling is excellent. But what keeps me watching is the performances, specifically Don Cheadles. This man is quite simply a great actor. Cicely Tyson remains one of our greatest assets, and the whole cast brings a sensitivity and authenticity to it that makes it a good movie.

The story of a tragic incident that forces an innocent young country boy to become a man before his time, is fascinating.  The actors give a performance that makes you believe you are there, trying to understand, empathize and grow with the community suffering with one of their own.The lesson is very simple; to learn and understand who you are and the proud, strong and loving peoples you come from. This, no person or court of persons can ever take away from you, even in death. Learn to be a man who knows thyself and thy God. Then teach others.
