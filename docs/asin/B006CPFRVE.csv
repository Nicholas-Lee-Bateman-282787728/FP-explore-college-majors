Those that are complaining about it... find something more constructive to do, such as writing Cartoon Network and expressing your unhappiness over the lack of season sets.  Cartoons generally don't sell well as season sets.  Have you seen how most cartoons are actually released?  You usually get around 45 minutes worth of episodes for this price.  This isn't a season set, but it is a very generous set, that has a wide range of episodes.They slapped this together and released it, sure.  But it's better to have something in hand than nothing at all.  And it's a good value to boot, they aren't charging a king's ransom for it.

Goddess would tell me to leave it on whenever it was on. She liked it. Eventually when she didn't need help searching through the channels she would select it herself. One day while dusting her room with her a few months ago, I watched with her. It is a funny show. The characters are hysterical and the jokes are so smart that they are shared on two levels. Kids find it funny and adults can laugh too on the jokes that are wittingly over the kids heads.Kids like it because there are tons of ""fart"" jokes and is really bizarre.

But when Jake goes too far, his imagination literally runs wild.""The Enchiridion"" - Princess Bubblegum sends the two out on a quest to find an ancient book, but must face a few trials each one worse than the last.""Slumber Party Panic"" - An experiment to revive dead candy people goes horribly wrong and now candy zombies are on the loose !  And you don't wanna know what happens when normal candy people freak out.""Prisoners of Love"" - The insidious Ice King has imprisoned a bunch of princesses because he wants to marry one.  Enter Finn and Jake who must come up with a plan to save the day.""Business Time"" - Some businessmen wash up on a shore and our adventuring companions put them to use.
