Susan Jordan (Shannen Doherty) leads a team to find her father and his colleagues, who are trapped in the city by Aztec warriors and their serpent god. Michael Shanks from Stargate SG-1 is a member of the search team.  Co-starring in the movie are J R Bourne, Toby Berner, Heather Doerksen, Duncan Fraser and Peter New. The movie was filmed in Kamloops, British Columbia.  (I wonder why they didn't film it in the Grand Canyon?)  The scenery is beautiful.

The film was listed as 'unrated' and seemed to me to have potential for some bawdy antics from Heather Doerksen. Out in the middle of the Grand Canyon landscape anything can happen. Maybe even the feared monster could manage something like ripping a blouse or something. But none of that takes place, and the movie disappointed me because Shannen Doherty is so tame and conservative. Her 90210 acting gave me some hope she wouldn't be so victorian in her attire, and Shannen played in Hell on Heels as well as in Charmed with a lot more sexual energy. Michael Shanks was throttled back in potential too, and I think the emphasis was meant to fall more upon the savage tribe of lost Inca/Aztec type people, and if Michael Shanks wasn't in it, I'd have tossed this one into the garbage bin - too ashamed to give it away.

1221243,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B001NY4WNS,Julian Kennedy,"[1, 2]","The Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon: 1 out of 10: Well, I was two minutes into the film and my girlfriend jinxed us. 'Hey you know this movie isn't that bad'. I turned pale' real pale. You don't tempt the Gods like that. Not with a made for Sci-fi Channel movie. Not one where the lead is Shannen Doherty. The words barely left my girlfriend's mouth, and a CGI puppet began sliming a Frat Boy in a diaper. The Horror'. The Horror.If I am going to start somewhere, I have to start with the Frat Boys in diapers. The movie claims these are Aztecs still hidden in the Grand Canyon at the end of the 19th century. (I know I know) Apparently, they have been hiding from the white man for many years. Not to mention the Havasupai and the Painte and the Pai and the tourists at the Upper Canyon Ranch and perhaps the boys in blue down at Ft. Mohave.Anyway, this lost tribe of Aztecs, like some Japanese WW2 sniper still hiding in a palm tree in 1971, is hidden in the Grand Canyon. What seems stranger is that they consist almost entirely of a hereto thou undiscovered group of Aztecs who look like white college football players wearing diapers (well more of a mawashi) and war paint. I am all in favor of multicultural casting, but I can't believe that it isn't a little insensitive to portray Native Americans as, well, extras in a Fire Island movie.Hold on a second, Fire Island Movie????' The men are all buff and practically naked. The two women are wearing pants and done up to look twice their age. The monster spews slime on the buff boys for no good reason. Oh God, no, it's Jeepers Creepers 2 all over again. The homoerotic horror film strikes again.Now, I'm not sure that the over the top homoeroticism is director Farhad Mann's doing (or even intentional), but Mann is responsible for both Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace as well as Return to Two Moon Junction, so with a track record like that I am prepared to blame him for a Swine Flu outbreak, let alone this film.So what else went wrong? Well, the Quetzalcoatl design is all wrong (he looks like a puppet) and his CGI is bad by even the very low Sci-fi Channel standards. The sets look like Kirk and Spock are going to beam down at any moment. Half the explorers are grossly overweight; an unlikely condition in the far west wilderness that distance from a Wal-Mart. As noted above Shannen Doherty, who isn't even forty, looks forty-five; and Heather Doerksen, who isn't even thirty, looks fifty. Finally, they have a five minute flashback at the end that repeats the entire film.But let's face it, buff white frat boys in diapers getting slimed from off camera and pretending to be Indians? Yeah, that is just all sorts of wrong.",1,The Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon...

1221247,A25BGV46BKHIX8,B001NY4WNS,"Pamela R. Heath ""writer""","[19, 21]","I really felt sorry for Michael Shanks as Dr. Thane in this movie. Not because of what he goes through, but because his dialogue is about as stiff and unoriginal as I've heard in a very long time. I rather liked the monster, but the script, directing, editing, and bulk of the acting were terrible.  Most of the Aztec warriors looked like pale Canadian extras with bad fake tans. Except for Shanks, all of the actors regularly seemed to miss their beats. There would be just a pause too long or a pedestrian delivery. Even Michael Shanks seemed to struggle at times with his delivery. However, to give him credit, Shanks was able to pull it off better than the others. Any fans who force themselves to sit through this film will be rewarded by a number of small moments in the movie, when Shanks somehow manages to rise above the terrible writing and draw us in with a look or a smile. However, for the most part, I was cheering when every character died because it meant one less actor trashing his or her lines.That said, there are a couple scenes that I enjoyed. One is watching Michael Shank's archeologist character ride up to the rescue on a mule carrying an umbrella like a parasol. I couldn't help wondering if it was a nod to Elizabeth Peter's intrepid character of Amelia Peabody, Egyptian archeologist. I also give the writers credit for surprising me at the end with a moment I didn't see coming, which made me laugh in delight.It's a shame the dialogue was so bad. This really could have been an interesting story if handled better. Dr. Thane (played by Shanks) is not your usual hero and has the makings of a really fun and intriguing character. Unfortunately, one actor, no matter how good, cannot rescue a truly bad movie.In some ways, the movie could have been summed up in one line of the dialogue, where Shank's character is asked, ""What are you doing?"" and he simply says ""I don't know."" Poor guy. I hope he was well paid.I debated giving the movie one star, but because of Michael Shank's character, and a few choice moments, am giving it two stars.",2,When bad dialogue happens to good actors,1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,2070,"['really', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'Dr.', 'Thane', 'movie', 'Not', 'what', 'dialogue', 'stiff', 'unoriginal', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'rather', 'liked', 'monster', 'script', 'directing', 'editing', 'bulk', 'acting', 'were', 'terrible', 'Most', 'Aztec', 'warriors', 'looked', 'pale', 'Canadian', 'extras', 'bad', 'fake', 'tans', 'Shanks', 'actors', 'regularly', 'seemed', 'miss', 'beats', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'pause', 'too', 'long', 'pedestrian', 'delivery', 'Even', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'seemed', 'struggle', 'times', 'delivery', 'However', 'give', 'credit', 'Shanks', 'was', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'better', 'others', 'Any', 'fans', 'who', 'force', 'sit', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'number', 'small', 'moments', 'movie', 'when', 'Shanks', 'somehow', 'rise', 'terrible', 'writing', 'draw', 'look', 'smile', 'However', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'cheering', 'when', 'character', 'died', 'meant', 'one', 'less', 'actor', 'trashing', 'lines.That', 'said', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'enjoyed', 'One', 'watching', 'Michael', 'Shank', 'archeologist', 'character', 'ride', 'rescue', 'mule', 'carrying', 'umbrella', 'parasol', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'was', 'nod', 'Elizabeth', 'Peter', 'intrepid', 'character', 'Amelia', 'Peabody', 'Egyptian', 'archeologist', 'also', 'give', 'writers', 'credit', 'surprising', 'end', 'moment', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'made', 'delight.It', 'shame', 'dialogue', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'story', 'handled', 'better', 'Dr.', 'Thane', 'played', 'Shanks', 'not', 'usual', 'hero', 'makings', 'really', 'fun', 'intriguing', 'character', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'actor', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'can', 'not', 'rescue', 'truly', 'bad', 'ways', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'summed', 'up', 'one', 'line', 'dialogue', 'where', 'Shank', 'character', 'asked', 'What', 'are', 'doing', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Poor', 'guy', 'hope', 'was', 'well', 'paid.I', 'debated', 'giving', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'Michael', 'Shank', 'character', 'few', 'choice', 'moments', 'am', 'giving', 'two', 'stars']",Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon

1221250,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001NY4WNS,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","The Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon (Farhad Mann, 2008)Shannen Doherty's most recent attempt to resuscitate her television career is bound to do about as well as the last dozen did. The Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon is the kind of movie that makes me wonder whether the powers that be in the acquisitions department at the Sci-Fi Channel really will buy anything you throw at them. I've seen movies filmed on four-figure budgets this month with better plots, more solid acting, and more inspired direction. This isn't even phoned in; someone dashed off an email instead.Doherty stars as the spunky (of course) daughter of a missing archaeologist (The Exorcism of Emily Rose's Duncan Fraser) in turn-of-the-century Arizona. The dig he's supposed to be working on, before he went off on his jaunt in the mountains, is currently being headed up by his assistant (Heather Doerksen, recently of the remake of The Eye) and supervised by a member of the Smithsonian (Michael Shanks). There's another chap around who seems to be in some sort of supervisory position (J. R. Bourne), but I never quite caught why he was such a bigwig. Anyway, a journalist friend of said missing archaeologist shows up in camp one day with a lead, and the troupe head off to the grand canyon to find out if he's still alive. This involves discovering whether his long-held belief that ancient Egyptians settled in Arizona is valid or not. (This is not nearly as ludicrous when you remember a similar Sci-FI Channel Original Dog called Legion of the Dead, where ancient Egyptians had settled in southern California, or at least that's what the palm trees and license plates taught us.)  Unfortunately for the team, the reality turns out to be a good deal more plausible, if also more deadly.It will eventually occur to low-budget movie directors and bad TV writers everywhere that people watched Beverly Hills 90210 in spite of Doherty's presence, not because of it (and she was certainly not the only actor in that cast who was subpar in that arena), and that she's relatively useless as a draw. Mann (The Lawnmower Man 2) did, however, manage a pretty impressive feat here in making sure that Doherty was actually the best actor of the bunch. There's not a single good performance to be found in this movie. Not even a decent one. The badly-CGIed creature conveys more emotion than these characters do. It doesn't help that Mann does absolutely nothing to help the process along; he's shooting (supposedly, anyway) in one of the most photogenic places on the planet, and does he take advantage of this at all?

1221251,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001NY4WNS,trebe,"[3, 4]","Having nothing to do with the state of Arizona, this daughter searching for her lost archeologist father tale, is characterized by mediocre acting, bad dialog, weak special effects, fake looking sets, badly cast natives, and a story that offers little that is credible or original.Dr. Samuel Jordan (Duncan Fraser), is missing, and his daughter Susan (Shannen Dohrety) organizes a search party and heads off into the desert to find him.  After gaining a few members, the group finds a sliding rock door in the face of a mountain, and enters a cave.  This eventually leads to a secret canyon, home to a lost Aztec civilization, who cut out the hearts of human sacrifices to appease the bloodthirsty flying deity apparently identified as Quetzalcoatl.There is little that is likeable or redeeming about most of the characters, though that is probably more a result of the terrible screenplay, than a lack of acting talent.  Jacob Thain (Michael Shanks), a supposed expert on the Aztecs, emerges as the group's leader, and spouting a stream of pompous know-it-all dialog, soon becomes a constant source of annoyance.This a cartoonish effort, where the special effects are weak and unimpressive, the sets look crappy, and despite the deadly serious tone, almost everything that happens is unrealistic and seems totally phony.  It's typical Sy Fy material, but of a very low grade variety.  Notice to parents, there are several scenes depicting a heart being ripped from someone's chest, which may be upsetting to children.  Save your hard earned money and catch it on Sy Fy if you're curious about what Shannen Dohrety is up to lately.",1,heart wrenchingly awful . . .,1281744000,"08 14, 2010",2010,1631,"['Having', 'nothing', 'do', 'state', 'Arizona', 'daughter', 'searching', 'lost', 'archeologist', 'father', 'tale', 'characterized', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'bad', 'dialog', 'weak', 'special', 'effects', 'fake', 'looking', 'sets', 'badly', 'cast', 'natives', 'story', 'little', 'credible', 'original.Dr', 'Samuel', 'Jordan', 'Duncan', 'Fraser', 'missing', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'Shannen', 'Dohrety', 'search', 'party', 'heads', 'off', 'desert', 'find', 'gaining', 'few', 'members', 'group', 'sliding', 'rock', 'door', 'face', 'mountain', 'cave', 'eventually', 'secret', 'canyon', 'home', 'lost', 'Aztec', 'civilization', 'who', 'cut', 'out', 'hearts', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'appease', 'bloodthirsty', 'flying', 'deity', 'apparently', 'identified', 'Quetzalcoatl.There', 'little', 'likeable', 'redeeming', 'most', 'characters', 'probably', 'more', 'result', 'terrible', 'screenplay', 'lack', 'acting', 'talent', 'Jacob', 'Thain', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'supposed', 'expert', 'Aztecs', 'group', 'leader', 'spouting', 'stream', 'pompous', 'know-it-all', 'dialog', 'soon', 'constant', 'source', 'annoyance.This', 'cartoonish', 'effort', 'where', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'weak', 'unimpressive', 'sets', 'look', 'crappy', 'deadly', 'serious', 'tone', 'almost', 'everything', 'unrealistic', 'totally', 'phony', 'typical', 'Sy', 'Fy', 'material', 'very', 'low', 'grade', 'variety', 'Notice', 'parents', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'heart', 'being', 'ripped', 'someone', 'chest', 'may', 'be', 'upsetting', 'children', 'Save', 'hard', 'earned', 'money', 'catch', 'Sy', 'Fy', ""'re"", 'curious', 'what', 'Shannen', 'Dohrety', 'up', 'lately']",Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon
1221252,A1S13O7V60UM9O,B001NY4WNS,"Valerie ""ValsVicinity""","[1, 1]","""Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon"" is pretty much a standard SyFy channel offering, with the exception that it's set in the early 1900's. This was definitely not the best movie I've ever seen, but I can't say it was the very worst I've ever seen, either. Mildy entertaining, but at times I found my mind wandering. I give it 2.5 stars, so I rounded up to 3.Fans of Stargate SG-1 will appreciate seeing Michael Shanks (SG-1's Daniel) and J.R. Bourne (SG-1's Martouf). Oddly enough Michael Shanks is an archeologist here, too. I won't detail the storyline as others have already done so.I realize this is from SyFy, and that life isn't all roses, but I was kind of surprised at the amount of gore, some of it was quite gross. I haven't seen it quite this bad with SyFy's other movies. Since this is a TV movie and it's ""not rated"", I wanted to point this out. (I would rate it at least pg-13 due to the gore.)A few examples: a man gets shot in the forehead with an arrow, someone commits suicide and chunky-looking blood is shown hitting the wall, a couple of people are cut open on an alter (while conscious) and their hearts are taken out while blood runs down their sides, and the worst was when a man had half his head cut off at a steep angle in a booby-trap. While we're talking about content, there are no bedroom scenes, however a man makes an inappropriate comment when he finds a woman looking for something in his tent. Hopefully this partial content review will help someone make a more informed decision! :)I really can't see watching this more than once...while I did watch the whole thing, I have no desire to ever see it again. At times it wasn't too bad, but other (most) times I was anxious for it to be over. If you're curious, rent it or try to catch it on Syfy, but I wouldn't recommend making a decision to buy it until after you've seen it.",3,Mildy entertaining at times...mostly forgettable,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,1862,"['Lost', 'Treasure', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'SyFy', 'channel', 'offering', 'exception', 'set', 'early', '1900', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'very', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Mildy', 'entertaining', 'times', 'found', 'mind', 'wandering', 'give', '2.5', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', '3.Fans', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'will', 'appreciate', 'seeing', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'SG-1', 'Daniel', 'J.R.', 'Bourne', 'SG-1', 'Martouf', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'archeologist', 'here', 'too', 'wo', ""n't"", 'detail', 'storyline', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'so.I', 'realize', 'SyFy', 'life', ""n't"", 'roses', 'was', 'kind', 'surprised', 'amount', 'gore', 'was', 'quite', 'gross', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'quite', 'bad', 'SyFy', 'other', 'movies', 'TV', 'movie', 'not', 'rated', 'wanted', 'point', 'out', 'would', 'rate', 'least', 'pg-13', 'due', 'gore', 'few', 'examples', 'man', 'shot', 'forehead', 'arrow', 'someone', 'commits', 'suicide', 'chunky-looking', 'blood', 'shown', 'hitting', 'wall', 'couple', 'people', 'are', 'cut', 'open', 'alter', 'conscious', 'hearts', 'are', 'taken', 'out', 'blood', 'runs', 'down', 'sides', 'worst', 'was', 'when', 'man', 'had', 'head', 'cut', 'off', 'steep', 'angle', 'booby-trap', ""'re"", 'talking', 'content', 'are', 'bedroom', 'scenes', 'however', 'man', 'inappropriate', 'comment', 'when', 'woman', 'looking', 'something', 'tent', 'Hopefully', 'partial', 'content', 'review', 'will', 'help', 'someone', 'make', 'more', 'informed', 'decision', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'did', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'have', 'desire', 'ever', 'see', 'again', 'times', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'other', 'most', 'times', 'was', 'anxious', 'be', ""'re"", 'curious', 'rent', 'try', 'catch', 'Syfy', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'making', 'decision', 'buy', ""'ve"", 'seen']",Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon
