1101078,A1DQHS7MOVYYYA,B000VE4UHO,A. Boston,"[16, 34]","I'm starting to wonder if I saw the same movie as other reviewers, because I can usually totally get into a 'chick flick'...but this wasn't one for me. I had tried to get my boyfriend and a friend or two to see this in the theatre with me, thank god no one agreed and I didn't waste the money.  I usually love drama with some romance mixed in and character driven plots. I was excited to see this movie and popped it in the DVD player immediately. I'm not going to go through the 'synopsis' because you can usually find that in the description and I don't want to tell anyone too much or too little.What I will say -- I found this movie to be boring and pointless with no direction or real plot. It was just a bunch of random conversations between Meg Ryan's Character and either her kids and husband, or the kid across the street(Adam Brody). Almost everyone is acting irrationally and/or wacky. The only entertaining character was Adam Brody's grandmother.Something that made no sense, was that Meg Ryan's character and her daughter will without warning drop huge bombs about what's going on in their lives to a stranger! Meg Ryan's husband's character was very confusing. You start out thinking ""oh, he's a good guy"" but then they tell you things about him and you think ""why is she with him?"" but his actions do not back up the information about him. He's definitely not a multi-faceted character.Brody's character is driveling and annoying. I usually really love character driven movies but this was just too much. Hopefully the writer of the script will improve or find another career. I would recommend 'upside of anger' over this.",1,boring.,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,1638,"[""'m"", 'starting', 'wonder', 'saw', 'same', 'movie', 'other', 'reviewers', 'can', 'usually', 'totally', 'get', ""'chick"", 'flick', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'had', 'tried', 'get', 'boyfriend', 'friend', 'two', 'see', 'theatre', 'god', 'one', 'agreed', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'usually', 'love', 'drama', 'romance', 'mixed', 'character', 'driven', 'plots', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'movie', 'popped', 'DVD', 'player', 'immediately', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', ""'synopsis"", 'can', 'usually', 'find', 'description', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'tell', 'anyone', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'little.What', 'will', 'say', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'boring', 'pointless', 'direction', 'real', 'plot', 'was', 'just', 'bunch', 'random', 'conversations', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Character', 'either', 'kids', 'husband', 'kid', 'street', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'acting', 'irrationally', 'and/or', 'wacky', 'only', 'entertaining', 'character', 'was', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'grandmother.Something', 'made', 'sense', 'was', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'character', 'daughter', 'will', 'warning', 'drop', 'huge', 'bombs', 'what', 'going', 'lives', 'stranger', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'husband', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'confusing', 'start', 'out', 'thinking', 'oh', 'good', 'guy', 'then', 'tell', 'things', 'think', 'why', 'actions', 'do', 'not', 'back', 'up', 'information', 'definitely', 'not', 'multi-faceted', 'character.Brody', 'character', 'driveling', 'annoying', 'usually', 'really', 'love', 'character', 'driven', 'movies', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'Hopefully', 'writer', 'script', 'will', 'improve', 'find', 'career', 'would', 'recommend', ""'upside"", 'anger']",N/A

1101081,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000VE4UHO,Andrew Ellington,"[11, 11]","`In the Land of Women' had great potential to be a dramatic and moving character study.  Sadly it focuses too much on being appealing to the teenage crowd and so it loses a sense a maturity in parts.  It is still a good movie; in fact my wife and I enjoyed it very much, I just feel that it could have, and should have been better.  There are things placed within this film that you can tell are there to draw a particular crowd, but then there are moments that scream out with a subtle maturity that I only wish had been consistent throughout.The film revolves around Carter Webb, a screenwriter for the adult entertainment industry.  After his celebrity girlfriend Sophia breaks his heart he decides it would be a good idea for him to leave the L.A. life behind and find himself.  So, when his mother informs him that his grandmother is paranoid she may die soon he takes that as his opportunity of escape and makes the trip out to Michigan to visit her.  His grandmother Phyllis is apparently delusional, but she a riot and so it's a welcomed delusion.  Carter soon meets the Hardwicke's who live across the street from Phyllis.  He soon forms an attachment with the mother Sarah and the teenage daughter Lucy and throughout their time together they change each others lives drastically.The Hardwicke family has a lot of demons trapped in the closet, especially Sarah and Lucy, and for some reason they feel a comfortableness with Carter that allows them to get things off their chest.  There is truth in the idea that there lies a certain comfort with strangers and I think that plays a large role in understanding this film.  Some have balked at the fact that Sarah and Lucy would not divulge huge family secrets to a complete stranger but I beg to differ.  Sometimes we need sounding boards and it's much easier to sound off on someone not emotionally invested in your or your problems, someone that can't judge you because they don't know you.  Sarah and Lucy have a lot they keep bottled up because there is no one for them to talk to about, but now they have Carter.Adam Brody has been breaking out in a large way the past few years due to his stint on `The O.C.' and this is really his first leading role.  He handles it well enough.  There are certain aspects of his character I felt were forced in order to make him `cool' in the eyes of teenagers and I didn't particularly like that.  Kristen Stewart's (can you believe this is the same little girl from `Panic Room'?) character Lucy is another one of those overly clich&eacute;d characters.  Every stereotype in the book is thrown at her as far as how a rebellious teenage daughter would act.  She handles the role decently enough; I just wish they would have given her more.  Olympia Dukakis is hilarious as Phyllis and she has some of the most memorable lines.  The real standout here though is Meg Ryan who tackles her `sick mom' character with real warmth and conviction.  As Sarah you feel really connected to her.  I have always love Meg Ryan and really wish she would be given more attention.  She is a very capable actress who deserves more accolades for her impressive body of work.In the end `In the Land of Women' works well.  It fleshes out some nice character traits, especially when in regards Carter and Sarah whose relationship is the most interesting of all.  I wish they had dropped the stereotypes though; left out the token party scene or the `teenage smoking' bit but it's not really enough to complain too much.  There are such sweet moments (one I particularly enjoyed was when Carter sits down to write the children's book he told his grandmother he wrote for a living) that I began to really wish the script had been tweaked to reach an older audience.  I guess that is my only complaint.  This is a film targeted towards the young when if it had been adjusted to target the middle-aged crowd could have turned into a genuinely moving adult drama.  Instead it remains a very well constructed teenage drama.  Three and a half stars for a film that with a little more maturity could have easily been four and a half or even five.",4,A very sound teenage drama that I only wish had been more adult oriented...,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,4116,"['Land', 'Women', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'be', 'dramatic', 'moving', 'character', 'study', 'Sadly', 'too', 'much', 'being', 'appealing', 'teenage', 'crowd', 'sense', 'maturity', 'parts', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'fact', 'wife', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'just', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'are', 'things', 'placed', 'film', 'can', 'tell', 'are', 'there', 'draw', 'particular', 'crowd', 'then', 'are', 'moments', 'scream', 'out', 'subtle', 'maturity', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'consistent', 'throughout.The', 'film', 'around', 'Carter', 'Webb', 'screenwriter', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'celebrity', 'girlfriend', 'Sophia', 'heart', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'leave', 'L.A.', 'life', 'find', 'So', 'when', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'paranoid', 'may', 'die', 'soon', 'opportunity', 'escape', 'trip', 'Michigan', 'visit', 'grandmother', 'Phyllis', 'apparently', 'delusional', 'riot', 'welcomed', 'delusion', 'Carter', 'soon', 'Hardwicke', 'who', 'live', 'street', 'Phyllis', 'soon', 'attachment', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'time', 'change', 'others', 'drastically.The', 'Hardwicke', 'family', 'lot', 'demons', 'trapped', 'closet', 'especially', 'Sarah', 'Lucy', 'reason', 'feel', 'comfortableness', 'Carter', 'get', 'things', 'off', 'chest', 'truth', 'idea', 'certain', 'comfort', 'strangers', 'think', 'large', 'role', 'understanding', 'film', 'have', 'balked', 'fact', 'Sarah', 'Lucy', 'would', 'not', 'divulge', 'huge', 'family', 'secrets', 'complete', 'stranger', 'beg', 'differ', 'Sometimes', 'need', 'sounding', 'boards', 'much', 'easier', 'sound', 'off', 'someone', 'not', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'problems', 'someone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Sarah', 'Lucy', 'have', 'lot', 'keep', 'bottled', 'up', 'one', 'talk', 'about', 'now', 'have', 'Carter.Adam', 'Brody', 'been', 'breaking', 'out', 'large', 'way', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'due', 'stint', 'O.C', 'really', 'first', 'leading', 'role', 'well', 'enough', 'are', 'certain', 'aspects', 'character', 'felt', 'were', 'forced', 'order', 'make', 'cool', 'eyes', 'teenagers', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'can', 'believe', 'same', 'little', 'girl', 'Panic', 'Room', 'character', 'Lucy', 'one', 'overly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'characters', 'stereotype', 'book', 'thrown', 'as', 'far', 'how', 'rebellious', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'would', 'act', 'role', 'decently', 'enough', 'just', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'hilarious', 'Phyllis', 'most', 'memorable', 'lines', 'real', 'standout', 'here', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'who', 'sick', 'mom', 'character', 'real', 'warmth', 'conviction', 'Sarah', 'feel', 'really', 'connected', 'have', 'always', 'love', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'be', 'given', 'more', 'attention', 'very', 'capable', 'actress', 'who', 'more', 'accolades', 'impressive', 'body', 'work.In', 'end', 'Land', 'Women', 'works', 'well', 'out', 'nice', 'character', 'traits', 'especially', 'when', 'regards', 'Carter', 'Sarah', 'relationship', 'most', 'interesting', 'wish', 'had', 'dropped', 'stereotypes', 'left', 'out', 'token', 'party', 'scene', 'teenage', 'smoking', 'bit', 'not', 'really', 'enough', 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'such', 'sweet', 'moments', 'one', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'when', 'Carter', 'down', 'write', 'children', 'book', 'told', 'grandmother', 'wrote', 'living', 'began', 'really', 'wish', 'script', 'had', 'been', 'tweaked', 'reach', 'older', 'audience', 'guess', 'only', 'complaint', 'film', 'targeted', 'young', 'when', 'had', 'been', 'adjusted', 'target', 'middle-aged', 'crowd', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'adult', 'drama', 'Instead', 'very', 'well', 'constructed', 'teenage', 'drama', 'Three', 'half', 'stars', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'maturity', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'four', 'half', 'even', 'five']",N/A

With ""In the Land of Women"", she reveals a depth, an assurance, that is a joy to watch. Dealing with her older daughter's rebelliousness, and husband's infidelity, the discovery of a lump on her breast could easily been an excuse for 'over-the-top' histrionics, but she never loses her character's distinctiveness. In her awkward bonding with the younger Brody, yet motherly reaction to her daughter's attraction to him, while cancer treatment robs her hair and health, Ryan never hits a wrong note.

Twenty minutes in my friend commented on how slow it was and she left after 45. The wife and I wanted to turn this movie off, but we needed to see if something redeemed it by the end. It didn't. It was like not being able to pull yourself away from a trainwreck. We just couldn't do it.The movie was completely predictable. Everything I expected to happen then proceeded to happen. All of it. Films of this sort can be done well (for example LITTLE CHILDREN) but this was not done well. The younger daughter was probably the most interesting character for me, but she was completely off set by the obscenely flat character of her father. And speaking of which, the acting wasn't great.

(""Cute"" usually means: okay, wouldn't really watch it again, but there may be a couple of good parts.)Carter was dumped by his model/actress girlfriend and decided to go take care of his grandmother and gather his thoughts far from L.A. He writes soft core porn, but he wants to move on to something more meaningful, like writing about his high school days.He meets a mother and daughter who live across the street from his outspoken, strange grandmother (played by Olympia Dukakis) and finds that he is there to help the mother and daughter connect and reestablish their broken relationship. Something tragic is happening within their family and both the women get close very quickly to their new neighbor.There are a few reasons that I didn't really connect to this movie. It's another mediocre film that seems to take a theme from another. (had a Graduate-like feel) Also, I just don't enjoy movies that have lots of deep talks, but don't really say much. Last, it bothers me when it's dramatic, but in the wrong way. Carter says in passing that his school didn't have a football team, so one night, Lucy (the teenage girl) knocks on his window and randomly takes him to her high school football field. Also: Sarah (the mom) said, when Carter was talking about all of the love letters he had written to his ex-girlfriend, that she had NEVER received a letter like that.

1101093,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000VE4UHO,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 4]","This 2007 movie reeks of the puppy-warm hypersensitivity of CW/WB teen-angst dramas likeDawson's CreekandFelicityand even has Adam Brody, recently of Fox'sThe O.C., as its star. That's not to say that the story, written by filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan's youngest son Jon, doesn't have certain moments of resonance, but it remains stubbornly shallow in execution perhaps because this represents Jon Kasdan's directorial debut. Actual nuance is often replaced by moments of forced comedy and drama. Brody is an appealing actor and can be razor-sharp when given an appropriately sized role like his smarmy turn as a Hollywood studio assistant in 2006'sThank You for Smoking, but Kasdan makes him a mopey presence here with little latitude for revealing any emotional complexity.He plays Carter Webb, a 26-year old LA-based writer who specializes in soft porn (a plot point that isn't explored too much). His heart is broken when his pretty Spanish actress-model girlfriend Sofia, accelerating quickly on the Hollywood fast lane, summarily dumps him in a coffee shop. In order to decompress and heal, Carter decides to stay with his ailing, comically senile grandmother Phyllis in Michigan for a while. She lives across the street from the Hardwickes, and he gets to know mother Sarah and her two daughters Lucy and Paige. Before you shoutThe Graduate, the film does not go this exploitative route but instead looks at how Sarah and Lucy are drawn to Carter because of their own dilemmas. Sarah is an idle housewife who finds out she has breast cancer and a cheating husband, while Lucy is a typical angst-driven teen who has trouble dealing with boys and her parents. Nothing too surprising happens, mainly long dialogue scenes between the principals, while minor characters fade away entirely.As Lucy, Kristen Stewart looks like she may have the chops to become Scarlett Johansson's successor in alienated youth roles, though her constantly slouched posture and downward gaze gets wearing. Absent from the screen for at least three years, Meg Ryan is a welcome presence as Sarah, and it's nice to see she still has a career after her lengthy string of 1990's romantic comedies. Minus her trademark twinkle, she manages to bring depth to a tightly wound character defined by her sorrow, and yet Kasdan shifts away from her character's relationship with Carter just when it gets interesting. The main challenge in watching her as a forty-something suburban matron is how much she simply doesn't look like one. Makenzie Vega plays Paige with predictable precociousness, while others barely register, including Olympia Dukakis on automatic pilot as Phyllis, JoBeth Williams as Carter's useless mother Agnes and Elena Anaya looking very much like Audrey Tautou's baby sister as Sofia. Perhaps reflective of the film's poor box office reception, the DVD contains no extras.",3,Mopey Look at a Young Writer's Emotional Catharsis Aided by Ryan's Solid Work,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,2862,"['2007', 'movie', 'reeks', 'puppy-warm', 'hypersensitivity', 'CW/WB', 'teen-angst', 'dramas', 'likeDawson', 'CreekandFelicityand', 'even', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'recently', ""Fox'sThe"", 'O.C.', 'star', 'not', 'say', 'story', 'written', 'filmmaker', 'Lawrence', 'Kasdan', 'youngest', 'son', 'Jon', ""n't"", 'have', 'certain', 'moments', 'resonance', 'stubbornly', 'shallow', 'execution', 'perhaps', 'Jon', 'Kasdan', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Actual', 'nuance', 'often', 'replaced', 'moments', 'forced', 'comedy', 'drama', 'Brody', 'appealing', 'actor', 'can', 'be', 'razor-sharp', 'when', 'given', 'appropriately', 'sized', 'role', 'smarmy', 'turn', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'assistant', ""2006'sThank"", 'Smoking', 'Kasdan', 'mopey', 'presence', 'here', 'little', 'latitude', 'revealing', 'emotional', 'complexity.He', 'plays', 'Carter', 'Webb', '26-year', 'old', 'LA-based', 'writer', 'who', 'soft', 'porn', 'plot', 'point', ""n't"", 'explored', 'too', 'much', 'heart', 'broken', 'when', 'pretty', 'Spanish', 'actress-model', 'girlfriend', 'Sofia', 'accelerating', 'quickly', 'Hollywood', 'fast', 'lane', 'summarily', 'coffee', 'shop', 'order', 'decompress', 'heal', 'Carter', 'stay', 'ailing', 'comically', 'senile', 'grandmother', 'Phyllis', 'Michigan', 'while', 'street', 'Hardwickes', 'know', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'two', 'daughters', 'Lucy', 'Paige', 'shoutThe', 'Graduate', 'film', 'not', 'go', 'exploitative', 'route', 'instead', 'how', 'Sarah', 'Lucy', 'are', 'drawn', 'Carter', 'own', 'dilemmas', 'Sarah', 'idle', 'housewife', 'who', 'out', 'breast', 'cancer', 'cheating', 'husband', 'Lucy', 'typical', 'angst-driven', 'teen', 'who', 'trouble', 'dealing', 'boys', 'parents', 'Nothing', 'too', 'surprising', 'happens', 'mainly', 'long', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'principals', 'minor', 'characters', 'fade', 'away', 'entirely.As', 'Lucy', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'may', 'have', 'chops', 'become', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'successor', 'alienated', 'youth', 'roles', 'constantly', 'slouched', 'posture', 'downward', 'gaze', 'wearing', 'Absent', 'screen', 'least', 'three', 'years', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'welcome', 'presence', 'Sarah', 'nice', 'see', 'still', 'career', 'lengthy', 'string', '1990', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Minus', 'trademark', 'twinkle', 'bring', 'depth', 'tightly', 'wound', 'character', 'defined', 'sorrow', 'yet', 'Kasdan', 'shifts', 'away', 'character', 'relationship', 'Carter', 'just', 'when', 'interesting', 'main', 'challenge', 'watching', 'forty-something', 'suburban', 'matron', 'how', 'much', 'simply', ""n't"", 'look', 'one', 'Makenzie', 'Vega', 'Paige', 'predictable', 'precociousness', 'others', 'barely', 'register', 'including', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'automatic', 'pilot', 'Phyllis', 'JoBeth', 'Williams', 'Carter', 'useless', 'mother', 'Agnes', 'Elena', 'Anaya', 'looking', 'very', 'much', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'baby', 'sister', 'Sofia', 'Perhaps', 'reflective', 'film', 'poor', 'box', 'office', 'reception', 'DVD', 'extras']",N/A

So much for self-knowledge.I think what most attracted me here is attitude, which was achieved through a combination of the script and the great performances (although everything else--from the locations to the music, matched nicely).  I've long been a ""fan"" of Zen and Taoism, although a fairly casual fan (which I think is appropriate).  This tale of an understated softcore ""erotica"" scriptwriter from Hollywood who makes a sojourn to Michigan to live with his elderly, hypochondriacal grandmother and becomes wrapped up in the lives of the females in the family across the street is a good exemplar of a realistic Zen/Taoist approach to life.  It's not that every character exemplifies this, or that any of them do at all times, but that's what's realistic about it--not everything will be even-keel.  Living mindfully in the moment involves doing so when we get upset or worried, too; it's part of the Zen ""return to the market"".All of the main characters and most of the auxiliary characters are likable.  Director Jon Kasdan infuses the film with a fair amount of very funny humor--this could have been hilarious if the aim were to just make a comedy.  Everyone is going through major life trials and occasionally traumatic events.  But everyone remains relatively cool, and Kasdan makes the smart move of not overplaying anything, not following melodramatic openings, and leaving threads that aren't unresolved but that resolve in very subtle and unexpected ways--and that's just like life is most of the time.",5,I guess this genre is growing on me,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,1712,"['Well', 'just', 'got', 'done', 'saying', 'slice', 'life', 'realist', 'drama-comedies', 'are', 'hardly', 'favorite', 'genre', 'review', 'Standing', 'Still', '2005', 'here', 'am', 'giving', 'second', 'one', '10', '10', 'So', 'much', 'self-knowledge.I', 'think', 'what', 'most', 'attracted', 'here', 'attitude', 'was', 'achieved', 'combination', 'script', 'great', 'performances', 'everything', 'else', 'locations', 'music', 'matched', 'nicely', ""'ve"", 'long', 'been', 'fan', 'Zen', 'Taoism', 'fairly', 'casual', 'fan', 'think', 'appropriate', 'tale', 'understated', 'softcore', 'erotica', 'scriptwriter', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'sojourn', 'Michigan', 'live', 'elderly', 'hypochondriacal', 'grandmother', 'becomes', 'wrapped', 'up', 'lives', 'females', 'family', 'street', 'good', 'exemplar', 'realistic', 'Zen/Taoist', 'approach', 'life', 'not', 'character', 'do', 'times', 'what', 'realistic', 'not', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'even-keel', 'Living', 'mindfully', 'moment', 'doing', 'so', 'when', 'get', 'upset', 'worried', 'too', 'part', 'Zen', 'return', 'market', '.All', 'main', 'characters', 'most', 'auxiliary', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'Director', 'Jon', 'Kasdan', 'film', 'fair', 'amount', 'very', 'funny', 'humor', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hilarious', 'aim', 'were', 'just', 'make', 'comedy', 'Everyone', 'going', 'major', 'life', 'trials', 'occasionally', 'traumatic', 'events', 'everyone', 'relatively', 'cool', 'Kasdan', 'smart', 'move', 'not', 'overplaying', 'anything', 'not', 'following', 'melodramatic', 'openings', 'leaving', 'threads', 'are', ""n't"", 'unresolved', 'resolve', 'very', 'subtle', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'just', 'like', 'life', 'most', 'time']",N/A

It is my hope that over time, this film will launch bigger careers for its cast as well as for its new screenwriter, Jon Kasdan, in this off-beat comedy/drama. Like others, I avoided this film because it was marketed horribly as a Meg Ryan/chick flick. For once, this screenwriter (Kasdan) avoids most, but not all, the marks of pandering to the lowest denominator where he meanders a bit before it aims for the profound. The plot you may read elsewhere. I will concentrate on what it has going for it First, its lead character, Adam Brody, plays the aspiring writer part perfectly and, astonishingly gains admiration at the finish by remaining true to his smarts. This is the first surprise, a male lead in a chick/flick who does not squander his ethics for commercial reasons, although with a little tweaking Kasdan could have given some saving respect for Meg Ryan's cad husband if he wanted to deliver a more polished script a la Garson Kanin. The story picks up considerably by the second half and rises higher to its finish. The &#34;Camille&#34;-like sub-plot goes away replaced by a sobering realism at the end. By then, you realize that Kasdan blazes a new trail here in his story that is secondary to the characters and what he wants to convey. And this is why this film will gain regard as the years go on. The story is about the healing power of conversation. The novice writer, Carter Webb (Adam Brody) is staying with his confused grandmother(Olympia Dukakis) whose dementia forces him to listen. That is just one reason why this film anticipates and addresses the technical disconnected generation to follow. The female supporting characters: Lucy (Kirsten Stewart) and her sister Paige (Mackenzie Vega) are marvelous future break-away stars capturing all the dangerous adolescent longings that become less so when you communicate with your parents. The parting scene, the leave-taking scenes between these characters was most remarkable by its EMPATHY. The bonus scene at the end seems like a toss-away, but isn't. You are sad knowing all the characters learned something, they were in the company of a special person and you see that he is happy. Which is reminiscent of &#34;Then Came Bronson,&#34; (Michael Parks) who moved on after each episode with his integrity and regard rising. What Kasdan created is a young man you would want to meet, be around, and miss when he's gone.

Having appeared as an actor in some films of his father Lawrence Kasdan (Grand Canyon, The Big Chill, Body Heat, Mumford, Dreamcatcher, The Bodyguard, etc), he has not only inherited his father's credo of making meaningful statements about life as we are currently living it, he has absorbed the fluid character development of those films and added his own sensitive touch with graceful dialog. He is a talent to watch.Soft porn writer Carter Webb (Adam Brody in a very fine performance) lives in Los Angeles near his depressed mother (JoBeth Williams) and has just been dumped by his actress girlfriend Sofia Bu&ntilde;uel (Elena Anaya). When his mother learns of her mother's failing state, the distraught Carter offers to travel to suburban Michigan to stay with his grandma Phyllis (Olympia Dukakis).  Once in picturesque Michigan Carter deals with his lovable but eccentric grandma and meets the across the street neighbors - mother Sarah (Meg Ryan in fine form), daughters Lucy (Kristin Stewart) and the younger Paige (Makenzie Vega), and errant husband Nelson (Clark Gregg).  In this setting of a 'woman world' Carter is key to aiding the various maladies of each of the women while addressing his own disappointing failed relationship.  The manner in which he intervenes by simply being present and tender and caring makes a positive impact on not only those around him but also on his own life and talent as a meaningful writer.In what could have been a soupy chick flick Jon Kasdan has instead provided a script that has a healthy dose of homespun philosophy and has guided his multi-talented cast to offer some of their finest moments on film.  This is an entertaining movie, but it is also a balm for viewers who have experienced life-threatening illness, broken homes, coping with the elderly, and ultimately coping with death.

If she is going to be tne one playing Bella in the movie of TWILIGHT, then it is bound to be a winner.  Here she plays the sullen, rebellious, teenage daughter of Meg Ryan in a midwestern suburb that's been manicured to within an inch of its life.  Her boyfriend is the chief jock in the high school and she hangs out with a trendy, Vogue-reading pack of gossip girls.  And yet for some reason she's not happy--well, if she was, there wouldn't be a movie.  To Lucy, Carter Webb the visitor from far off Los Angeles, is her entree into a more intriguing world of exile and possibility.  He's creative--a writer--and he still acts like he's in high school, which is reassuring.He has a comically sad relationship to his aging grandmother (Olympia Dukakis, flaming the screen with shreds of ham), which is just as winsome as Lucy's own relationship with her mother, the aforementioned Meg Ryan, going out of her way to act as if she really had cancer.The two houses across the street from each other form a dichotomy which the younger characters resent, always spilling out of domestic life and meeting in the middle of the street--I kept waiting for one of them to get run over by Kristen Stewart's car-crazy pack of jock friends.Adam Brody just wasn't right for this movie, and if it fails, it's because of two things, he's the same as Seth Cohen only without any snappy dialogue, and b, the whole script is written in a way that makes you think the producers are purposely avoiding letting Carter have sex with either mother or daughter.He's supposed to write soft core porn for HBO or whatever, but as the film makes it clear, he is as ignorant about sex as he is about everything else.  I guess he's okay, though how convenient that he gets to meet Ms. Right in the last sixty seconds of the movie.

1101114,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B000VE4UHO,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[4, 5]","In regards to In The Land Of Women I have found alot of people giving negative or so-so reviews. I mean no disrespect whatsoever but in my opinion the problem is they just didn't understand what the movie was when they went into it. It would be like me wanting to see a comedy but going to a horror movie and being upset that it wasn't funny. This film is very misunderstood, possibly in part by misadvertisement.The script is not written to be a melodramatic piece or to tug at your heart strings as to bring tears to your eyes. It is not meant to be entirely laugh out loud funny or completely realistic. (People that comment on characters not acting in realistic ways always confuse me, just because you don't know people in real life that act a certain way doesn't mean there is no one who does). Though in this film I admit it is slightly hightened character interaction, I have yet to see a film that does not have at least one aspect of hightened reality, the interactions being what they are is what allows the film to be what writer John Kasdan had intended it to be.In The Land Of Women is completely successful in acheiving it's purpose, exploring and commenting on human nature and characteristics. It was written as Kasdan's point of view on certain aspects of life that he wanted to explore and i think the combination of topics goes well enough together to represent things people similar to Kasdan will relate to and things we may not relate to but have thought about such as cancer. The film is a commentary on the writers perspective of different aspects of life and human nature. If people stopped looking at it as what they expected it to be and started looking at it as that I think they may come to appreciate it more. Though alot of people may not like this genre i wish i could watch more like it, it is so hard to find a movie that cohesively represents the writers intent. I spend alot of time analyzing my life and the world around me and appreciate being able to view a medium that represents someone elses point of view in that regard.Sure the little girl was pretentious but the script points that out, sure it was hightened reality but when has a film not been hightened in some aspect. Sure the characters may not act in ways the majority of people will find logical but the script even points out that logical is only what we are used to and the characters themselves comment on feeling illogical in some of their actions and not understanding their feelings. Something i personally can relate to, who knows why we do and say certain things and when it is contrary to what is accepted as the norm why do we feel we are doing something wrong if it's what works for us. Also the term logically is all a matter of opinion since in my opinion most people don't act logically, and the characters actions are at least always a reaction or result of their emotions (emotions aren't always logical).I appreciate this film for what it is and hope others do, it is aimed at an audience that thinks about life and the various aspects of it. It is a commentary on human nature that is at times funny and filled with moments derived from most peoples real lives. Similarly toned films include The Lookout and parts of Disturbia (though Disturbia feels more aimed at my adolescence days). Other good movies I have seen lately are Blood Diamond, American Gangster and No Country For Old Men (which was a good mixture of the better aspects of all four).

1101117,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000VE4UHO,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","Jon Kasdan (son of filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan) makes a most auspicious directorial debut with ""In the Land of Women,"" an utterly charming and winning indie comedy/drama marked by interesting characters, complex relationships and delightful performances by a first-rate cast.When his fashion-model/actress girlfriend dumps him without warning, a ""soft-erotica"" writer by the name of Carter Webb leaves his home in L.A. to spend time with his eccentric grandmother in suburban Michigan.  A 26-year old who hasn`t been able to grab a hold of anything meaningful in his life thus far, Carter finds his world becoming even more complicated when he makes the acquaintance of a mother and daughter who live across the street from where he`s staying.The beauty of Kasdan's screenplay is that we never know where the story is going to take us at any given moment.  Moreover, the characters interact with one another in ways that are both believable and surprising, and no one is made out to be either a hero or a villain, a sinner or a saint.  Carter is coping with the pain of a failed romantic relationship, while the two women contend with marital difficulties, suburban angst, adolescent rebellion and a life-threatening illness.  Yet, for all the potential sturm und drang of the material, ""In the Land of Women"" maintains a light-hearted, lyrical tone throughout, thanks to witty dialogue and a full-hearted appreciation for the subtle little ironies and eccentricities of life.The performances could not be improved upon.  Adam Brody makes Carter into a sympathetically vulnerable figure who, at the same time, can display a surprising amount of strength and intestinal fortitude when the situation calls for it.  Makenzie Vega is sweet and charming as the literal girl-next-door who is quick to criticize her mother even though she doesn't know the woman quite as well as she thinks she does.  But it is Meg Ryan as Sarah Hardwicke, the full-time housewife and mother, who truly excels in her role, turning a potentially two-dimensional character into a multi-faceted woman of surprising depth and emotion.  With admirable restraint and understatement, Ryan conveys all the unspoken thoughts and feelings of a woman who is aware of the compromises she has made in life but who is far more wise and complex about the ways of the world than either her daughter or her philandering husband are willing to give her credit for.  Finally, Olympia Dukakis seems to be having the time of her life playing an attention-seeking, doddering old woman who may not be quite as out of it as she wants others to believe she is.As director, Kasdan takes full advantage of the bucolic Michigan setting (though it is remarkably lush and green for October), as Carter and Sarah take long, leisurely strolls around the neighborhood, getting to know one another and establishing a lasting relationship.Like them, the movie is not afraid to take its time laying out its storyline and revealing the hearts of its characters.  The result is an offbeat and deeply satisfying film that bodes well for the future career of its neophyte director.",4,offbeat romantic comedy/drama,1228003200,"11 30, 2008",2008,3115,"['Jon', 'Kasdan', 'son', 'filmmaker', 'Lawrence', 'Kasdan', 'most', 'auspicious', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Land', 'Women', 'utterly', 'charming', 'winning', 'indie', 'comedy/drama', 'marked', 'interesting', 'characters', 'complex', 'relationships', 'delightful', 'performances', 'first-rate', 'cast.When', 'fashion-model/actress', 'girlfriend', 'warning', 'soft-erotica', 'writer', 'name', 'Carter', 'Webb', 'home', 'L.A.', 'spend', 'time', 'eccentric', 'grandmother', 'suburban', 'Michigan', '26-year', 'old', 'who', 'hasn', 't', 'been', 'able', 'grab', 'hold', 'anything', 'meaningful', 'life', 'thus', 'far', 'Carter', 'world', 'becoming', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'acquaintance', 'mother', 'daughter', 'who', 'live', 'street', 'where', 's', 'staying.The', 'beauty', 'Kasdan', 'screenplay', 'never', 'know', 'where', 'story', 'going', 'take', 'given', 'moment', 'Moreover', 'characters', 'interact', 'one', 'ways', 'are', 'believable', 'surprising', 'one', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'either', 'hero', 'villain', 'sinner', 'saint', 'Carter', 'coping', 'pain', 'failed', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'two', 'women', 'contend', 'marital', 'difficulties', 'suburban', 'angst', 'adolescent', 'rebellion', 'life-threatening', 'illness', 'potential', 'sturm', 'drang', 'material', 'Land', 'Women', 'light-hearted', 'lyrical', 'tone', 'thanks', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'full-hearted', 'appreciation', 'subtle', 'little', 'ironies', 'eccentricities', 'life.The', 'performances', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'improved', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'Carter', 'sympathetically', 'vulnerable', 'figure', 'who', 'same', 'time', 'can', 'display', 'surprising', 'amount', 'strength', 'intestinal', 'fortitude', 'when', 'situation', 'Makenzie', 'Vega', 'sweet', 'charming', 'literal', 'girl-next-door', 'who', 'quick', 'criticize', 'mother', 'even', ""n't"", 'know', 'woman', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Sarah', 'Hardwicke', 'full-time', 'housewife', 'mother', 'who', 'truly', 'excels', 'role', 'turning', 'potentially', 'two-dimensional', 'character', 'multi-faceted', 'woman', 'surprising', 'depth', 'emotion', 'admirable', 'restraint', 'understatement', 'Ryan', 'unspoken', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'woman', 'who', 'aware', 'compromises', 'made', 'life', 'who', 'far', 'more', 'wise', 'complex', 'ways', 'world', 'daughter', 'philandering', 'husband', 'are', 'willing', 'give', 'credit', 'Finally', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'be', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'playing', 'attention-seeking', 'doddering', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'others', 'believe', 'is.As', 'director', 'Kasdan', 'full', 'advantage', 'bucolic', 'Michigan', 'setting', 'remarkably', 'lush', 'green', 'October', 'Carter', 'Sarah', 'take', 'long', 'leisurely', 'neighborhood', 'getting', 'know', 'one', 'establishing', 'lasting', 'relationship.Like', 'movie', 'not', 'afraid', 'take', 'time', 'laying', 'out', 'storyline', 'revealing', 'hearts', 'characters', 'result', 'offbeat', 'deeply', 'satisfying', 'film', 'well', 'future', 'career', 'neophyte', 'director']",N/A

Either way, the image looked acceptable during the day and night scenes, but in scenes with lots of background detail (like during their walks, as shown to the right) you can see the limitations of standard definition DVD. I'm chalking this up to being spoiled by high definition images on HD DVD, so take my criticism as a wish for what could be, but not unhappiness for what this DVD actually delivers.How Does it Sound?Being a movie that is primarily dialogue-driven, the sound doesn't play a large part. There are times when the soundtrack tries to become yet another cast member, but the effect was never jarring or unwelcome. Very seldom do the surrounds activate past very quiet levels.ExtrasThis DVD has no extras. I like to see the theatrical trailer included with movies, but this disc doesn't even include something as basic as that. Buried on the Languages menu there is a page containing links to the Warner Bros. Pictures web site, but that's it. I even looked on the pan and scan side in the hopes that they might have put something there, but to no avail.ConclusionI enjoyed this movie much more than I was expecting to. I watched about half of the movie one evening, thinking that I would return the following evening to finish it. If you've ever read a book and gotten about half way through, only to find that you can't put it down, you'll be familiar with my inability to walk away from this movie with only half the story told.

1101122,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000VE4UHO,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[3, 3]","With a title like ""In the Land of Women,"" one might expect a grueling exercise in overdone immature comedy. Instead, Jonathan Kasdan delivers a heartfelt, poignant drama dissecting the values of life, love, and friendship, and the experiences that change the views held by its brilliant cast of interconnected characters.After a disheartening breakup with his girlfriend, Carter (Adam Brody) attempts to distance himself from his troubles by traveling to suburban Michigan to visit his dying grandmother, Phyllis (Olympia Dukakis). Shortly after his arrival Carter meets Sarah Hardwicke (Meg Ryan), the neighborly mother who lives across the street, and he quickly becomes intrigued by her charming nature and unique outlook on life. When he meets Sarah's two daughters, Lucy (Kristen Stewart) and Paige (Makenzie Vega), and becomes a sort of confidant to all three girls, his own views on life and love begin to change as his relationship with each helps to mend the emotional tears in their family.The characters are the true foundation of In the Land of Women, and finer performances are rarely seen. Carter is an instantly likeable persona thanks to Adam Brody and his polished portrayal of a character with realistic flaws and believable aspirations. He is a writer who dreams of utilizing his talent for a more worthwhile venture and finds love in the unlikeliest of situations. Meg Ryan embodies a far more complex character than we're used to seeing, and evokes everything from affection to pathos from her audience. Both Kristen Stewart and Makenzie Vega are talented beyond their years and offer astonishingly intense and mature performances. The likeably morose Phyllis provides much of the comedy relief and also forces Carter to rethink his notions of death and view life in a new light. The compellingly poignant interactions between each character infuse a level of believability into their unusual predicaments to create a connection with the audience almost as strong as the ones they have with each other.Perhaps Land's only flaw is also one of its finest points of originality and creativity. The intelligent dialogue that permeates the script both draws its audience into its world of intriguing characters while simultaneously keeping the viewer slightly distanced from the realism displayed. Do people truly have such emotionally charged and heart-wrenchingly challenging conversations? Perhaps not, but one can always hope, and the complex characters created here masterfully reveal an idyllic example of such individuals. While the situations portrayed may seem overly complicated, every character involved handles themselves exactly as one would want to see and every increasingly difficult predicament and strained relationship is made believable through exceptional acting and inspired dialogue. No real stumbles or faltering exists in their interactions, but a very real hesitation and a touch of uncertainty in certain conversations adds to the overall attractiveness of each character as they cope with their trying relationships. Only once was an intensely interesting moment cut short (an emotional sequence in a diner when Paige demands the truth from her mother, and consequently the respect involved with comprehending its weight), forcing me to ponder why one such memorable scene wasn't concluded more satisfactorily when all others were.Subtle humor permeates much of the film, persuading the tone to remain light. Idyllic conclusions find their way into somber and delicate situations resulting in a moving, feel-good movie where tears of joy will likely replace those of sorrow. Though over-sentimentality may intrude upon satisfying drama from time to time, excellent pacing, endearing characters superbly acted, and thought-provoking, poignant dialogue make this Land one worth visiting.- Joel Massie",4,In the Land of Women Movie Review,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,3842,"['title', 'Land', 'Women', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'grueling', 'exercise', 'overdone', 'immature', 'comedy', 'Instead', 'Jonathan', 'Kasdan', 'heartfelt', 'poignant', 'drama', 'dissecting', 'values', 'life', 'love', 'friendship', 'experiences', 'change', 'views', 'held', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'interconnected', 'characters.After', 'disheartening', 'breakup', 'girlfriend', 'Carter', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'distance', 'troubles', 'traveling', 'suburban', 'Michigan', 'visit', 'dying', 'grandmother', 'Phyllis', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'Shortly', 'arrival', 'Carter', 'Sarah', 'Hardwicke', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'neighborly', 'mother', 'who', 'street', 'quickly', 'intrigued', 'charming', 'nature', 'unique', 'outlook', 'life', 'When', 'Sarah', 'two', 'daughters', 'Lucy', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Paige', 'Makenzie', 'Vega', 'sort', 'confidant', 'three', 'girls', 'own', 'views', 'life', 'love', 'begin', 'change', 'relationship', 'helps', 'mend', 'emotional', 'tears', 'family.The', 'characters', 'are', 'true', 'foundation', 'Land', 'Women', 'finer', 'performances', 'are', 'rarely', 'seen', 'Carter', 'instantly', 'likeable', 'persona', 'thanks', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'polished', 'portrayal', 'character', 'realistic', 'flaws', 'believable', 'aspirations', 'writer', 'who', 'utilizing', 'talent', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'venture', 'love', 'unlikeliest', 'situations', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'character', ""'re"", 'used', 'seeing', 'evokes', 'everything', 'affection', 'pathos', 'audience', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Makenzie', 'Vega', 'are', 'talented', 'years', 'offer', 'astonishingly', 'intense', 'mature', 'performances', 'likeably', 'morose', 'Phyllis', 'much', 'comedy', 'relief', 'also', 'forces', 'Carter', 'rethink', 'notions', 'death', 'view', 'life', 'new', 'light', 'compellingly', 'poignant', 'interactions', 'character', 'infuse', 'level', 'believability', 'unusual', 'predicaments', 'create', 'connection', 'audience', 'almost', 'as', 'strong', 'ones', 'have', 'other.Perhaps', 'Land', 'only', 'flaw', 'also', 'one', 'finest', 'points', 'originality', 'creativity', 'intelligent', 'dialogue', 'script', 'audience', 'world', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'simultaneously', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'slightly', 'distanced', 'realism', 'displayed', 'Do', 'people', 'truly', 'have', 'such', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'heart-wrenchingly', 'challenging', 'conversations', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'one', 'can', 'always', 'hope', 'complex', 'characters', 'created', 'here', 'masterfully', 'reveal', 'idyllic', 'example', 'such', 'individuals', 'situations', 'portrayed', 'may', 'seem', 'overly', 'complicated', 'character', 'involved', 'exactly', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'predicament', 'strained', 'relationship', 'made', 'believable', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'inspired', 'dialogue', 'real', 'stumbles', 'faltering', 'exists', 'interactions', 'very', 'real', 'hesitation', 'touch', 'uncertainty', 'certain', 'conversations', 'overall', 'attractiveness', 'character', 'cope', 'trying', 'relationships', 'Only', 'once', 'was', 'intensely', 'interesting', 'moment', 'cut', 'short', 'emotional', 'sequence', 'diner', 'when', 'Paige', 'truth', 'mother', 'consequently', 'respect', 'involved', 'comprehending', 'weight', 'forcing', 'ponder', 'why', 'one', 'such', 'memorable', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'concluded', 'more', 'satisfactorily', 'when', 'others', 'were.Subtle', 'humor', 'permeates', 'much', 'film', 'persuading', 'tone', 'remain', 'light', 'Idyllic', 'conclusions', 'find', 'way', 'somber', 'delicate', 'situations', 'resulting', 'moving', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'where', 'tears', 'joy', 'will', 'likely', 'replace', 'sorrow', 'over-sentimentality', 'may', 'intrude', 'satisfying', 'drama', 'time', 'time', 'excellent', 'pacing', 'endearing', 'characters', 'superbly', 'acted', 'thought-provoking', 'poignant', 'dialogue', 'make', 'Land', 'one', 'worth', 'visiting.-', 'Joel', 'Massie']",N/A

In the Land of Women is like Grape Nuts, it is a movie trying to be a drama and a romantic comedy, but it is neither.

Still sore from the break-up he decides to move to Michigan to take care of his ailing grandmother, and to get away from LA. Once he moves to Michigan he starts to befriend the mother (Meg Ryan), and daughter Lucy (Kristen Stewart) of the family who lives across the street. What continues from there is a brief melodrama of Adam Brody struggling with feelings for Meg Ryan, Lucy, and his ex-girlfriend.The script had two major problems, the first being there was almost zero character development. The film opens when AB is being dumped by Actress and by the third scene he is already leaving for Michigan. Once there he starts to get to know the other family so fast their characters come across as empty. The exception was Meg Ryan because of Meg Ryan being able to add so much in so little time. The second problem was that it seemed like it was half way finished. As if the screenwriter was still revising it and getting ready to write the climax. When the credits rolled it felt like it was still in the middle and suddenly the filmmakers got tired and decided to just end it. The director definitely did not help, or make use of the wonderful cast he had.The acting was good, but because of the poor character development and script; it hurt the performance put out by Adam Brody and Kristen Stewart. Meg Ryan was able to salvage her role just enough to make her character the only one worth watching, but even her performance was unable to make the whole movie worth watching.",2,In the Land of Nothingness...,1202428800,"02 8, 2008",2008,1937,"['cereal', 'Grape', 'Nuts', 'very', 'deceiving', 'name', 'grapes', 'nuts', 'Land', 'Women', 'Grape', 'Nuts', 'movie', 'trying', 'be', 'drama', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'neither', 'ultimately', 'so', 'horribly', 'short', 'wondering', 'what', 'genre', 'supposed', 'fit', 'in.In', 'Land', 'Women', 'story', 'young', 'porn', 'screenwriter', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'LA', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'dumped', 'actress/model', 'girlfriend', 'Still', 'sore', 'break-up', 'move', 'Michigan', 'take', 'care', 'ailing', 'grandmother', 'get', 'away', 'LA', 'Once', 'Michigan', 'befriend', 'mother', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'family', 'who', 'street', 'What', 'brief', 'melodrama', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'struggling', 'feelings', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Lucy', 'ex-girlfriend.The', 'script', 'had', 'two', 'major', 'problems', 'first', 'being', 'was', 'almost', 'zero', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'when', 'AB', 'being', 'dumped', 'Actress', 'third', 'scene', 'already', 'leaving', 'Michigan', 'Once', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'family', 'fast', 'characters', 'come', 'empty', 'exception', 'was', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'being', 'able', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'second', 'problem', 'was', 'seemed', 'was', 'half', 'way', 'finished', 'screenwriter', 'was', 'still', 'revising', 'getting', 'ready', 'write', 'climax', 'When', 'credits', 'rolled', 'felt', 'was', 'still', 'middle', 'suddenly', 'filmmakers', 'got', 'tired', 'decided', 'just', 'end', 'director', 'definitely', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'make', 'use', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'had.The', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'script', 'hurt', 'performance', 'put', 'out', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'was', 'able', 'salvage', 'role', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'character', 'only', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'performance', 'was', 'unable', 'make', 'whole', 'movie', 'watching']",N/A
