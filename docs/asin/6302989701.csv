349354,A91BK8S5QH98K,6302989701,CelticWomanFanPiano,"[3, 3]","This is a charming film based on a story written by academy award nominee, Karl Tunberg.  It features Sonja Heine as the charming young girl who gets mistaken for a wealthy playboy's mistress.  In order to dissuade the tongues that wag, the playboy's company sends her to University to model their clothes for the young college girls.  While there she meets a very handsome co-ed portrayed by Richard Greene.  Both lead actors have been forgotten somewhat, but their charm lives on in this film.  It also features Ceasar Romero in a very young role and the comic relief of Arthur Treacher.  It makes for a likeable film.  There is only one scene that is somewhat disturbing and that is two men who mistakenly end up kissing under the mistletoe.  But other than that, it makes for a nice film to watch at home.",5,Quite likeable!,1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,809,"['charming', 'film', 'based', 'story', 'written', 'academy', 'award', 'nominee', 'Karl', 'Tunberg', 'Sonja', 'Heine', 'charming', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'mistaken', 'wealthy', 'playboy', 'mistress', 'order', 'dissuade', 'tongues', 'wag', 'playboy', 'company', 'University', 'model', 'clothes', 'young', 'college', 'girls', 'very', 'handsome', 'co-ed', 'portrayed', 'Richard', 'Greene', 'lead', 'actors', 'have', 'been', 'forgotten', 'somewhat', 'charm', 'lives', 'film', 'also', 'Ceasar', 'Romero', 'very', 'young', 'role', 'comic', 'relief', 'Arthur', 'Treacher', 'likeable', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'mistakenly', 'end', 'up', 'kissing', 'mistletoe', 'other', 'nice', 'film', 'watch', 'home']",N/A

Wymore ""Golden Age of Hollywood fan""","[2, 2]","It isn't Sonja Henie I like so much - it's the men that she is paired with in her movies that make them enjoyable today. By today's standards, her skating is rather pedestrian and certainly not up to the calibre of today's skaters. Her acting isn't much to write home about, either. Oh - but the good looking men! My Lucky Star is probably her least-known film because it didn't pair her with one of Fox's more well know leading men (Richard Greene, best know for a Robin Hood TV series from the 1950s and a few Shirley Temple movies). Well unknown or not, he sure was a handsome guy. And so were her other leading men, especially John Payne. Perhaps Fox is dragging it's feet when it comes to putting her films on DVD because they think  - 1. there's no market and 2. they are in black and white and no one wants a movie in black and white (oh, but we do!). Hopefully Fox will see their way into releasing these films as ""video on demand"", the way that Warner Brothers markets their older, and maybe less popular films.",4,How about Sonja Henie on DVD?,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,1020,"[""n't"", 'Sonja', 'Henie', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'men', 'paired', 'movies', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'today', 'today', 'standards', 'skating', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'certainly', 'not', 'calibre', 'today', 'skaters', 'acting', ""n't"", 'much', 'write', 'home', 'Oh', 'good', 'looking', 'men', 'Lucky', 'Star', 'probably', 'least-known', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'pair', 'one', 'Fox', 'more', 'well', 'know', 'leading', 'men', 'Richard', 'Greene', 'best', 'know', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'TV', 'series', '1950s', 'few', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'movies', 'Well', 'unknown', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'handsome', 'guy', 'so', 'were', 'other', 'leading', 'men', 'especially', 'John', 'Payne', 'Perhaps', 'Fox', 'dragging', 'feet', 'when', 'putting', 'films', 'DVD', 'think', '1.', 'market', '2.', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'one', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'oh', 'do', 'Hopefully', 'Fox', 'will', 'see', 'way', 'releasing', 'films', 'video', 'demand', 'way', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'markets', 'older', 'maybe', 'less', 'popular', 'films']",N/A
