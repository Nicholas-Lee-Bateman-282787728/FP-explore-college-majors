124012,A2LHJTT1FT7XRD,0792109309,,"[4, 4]","My thoughts on this film are taken from watching it in it's original Vista Vision widescreen presentation of 1.75 on a laserdisc version released in 1998. Paramount decided not to push the limits of the 35mm format and I will mention that although you still have more image than the more readily availible full frame version - 1.33 - much more of the huge b36 bomber in close up shots would have been seen in the more common 2.35 widescreen ratio that the majority of studios used at that time. None the less the film is still spectacular to watch with color that is so beautiful it looks as good if not better than alot of fims made even today. I believe they used the Technicolor process which is the main reason that the print looks so good and has held up so well over time. One of my favorite moments- besides the wonderful aerial photography -is near the beginning when James Stewart is practising with his baseball team in Florida and you hear the sound of an aircraft approaching, as he looks up a B36 flies right over the field and you can see Stewart's attachment to flying in his facial expression- and the wonderful sound of that b36! So much in that one brief scene. One can only wish that they had devouted more time to filming those long gone aircraft but it is still an aviation enthusiast's delight to watch. This particular laserdisc version is very rare so it would be nice if Paramount would release it on dvd as that format would do the film a great justice. Not everyone will agree but films deserve to be seen in their original aspect ratio and in alot of examples one misses half of the intended image, and that is not good!",5,Great piece of '50s miltary aviation,1027728000,"07 27, 2002",2002,1648,"['thoughts', 'film', 'are', 'taken', 'watching', 'original', 'Vista', 'Vision', 'presentation', '1.75', 'laserdisc', 'version', 'released', '1998', 'Paramount', 'decided', 'not', 'push', 'limits', '35mm', 'format', 'will', 'mention', 'still', 'have', 'more', 'image', 'more', 'readily', 'availible', 'full', 'frame', 'version', '1.33', 'much', 'more', 'huge', 'b36', 'bomber', 'close', 'shots', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'more', 'common', '2.35', 'widescreen', 'ratio', 'majority', 'studios', 'used', 'time', 'None', 'less', 'film', 'still', 'spectacular', 'watch', 'color', 'so', 'beautiful', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'alot', 'fims', 'made', 'even', 'today', 'believe', 'used', 'Technicolor', 'process', 'main', 'reason', 'print', 'so', 'good', 'held', 'up', 'so', 'well', 'time', 'One', 'favorite', 'moments-', 'wonderful', 'aerial', 'photography', '-is', 'beginning', 'when', 'James', 'Stewart', 'practising', 'baseball', 'team', 'Florida', 'hear', 'sound', 'aircraft', 'approaching', 'up', 'B36', 'flies', 'right', 'field', 'can', 'see', 'Stewart', 'attachment', 'flying', 'facial', 'expression-', 'wonderful', 'sound', 'b36', 'So', 'much', 'one', 'brief', 'scene', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'devouted', 'more', 'time', 'filming', 'long', 'gone', 'aircraft', 'still', 'aviation', 'enthusiast', 'delight', 'watch', 'particular', 'laserdisc', 'version', 'very', 'rare', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'Paramount', 'would', 'release', 'dvd', 'format', 'would', 'do', 'film', 'great', 'justice', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'agree', 'films', 'deserve', 'be', 'seen', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'alot', 'examples', 'one', 'half', 'intended', 'image', 'not', 'good']",N/A
124013,A1166FE81ADOUR,0792109309,50s sci-fi Fan,"[2, 2]","I like ""The Strategic Air Command"" from a few angles. The plot was simple enough, a $70,000 per year baseball player (James Stewart) with ""a few good years of playing left"" goes resentfully back into the air force through a general call up of men in his age group. The Strategic Air Command has a desperate need for ""experienced hands"". The film leans heavily on Stewart's good guy charm and Allyson's typical 1950s homemaker sweetness to carry a plot that has some serious undertones.His wife (June Allyson), representative of SAC wives, at first is happy to go along with this ""as long as we are together"" but eventually becomes so stressed by Stewart's heavy workload and absences she accuses Gen. Hawkes (Frank Lovejoy) of flattery and promotions in rank to get more work out of ""Dutch"". Hawkes replies that he has no choice but to make full use of exceptional men.Some people commented that Allyson's character was a bit insipid, but I think you need to remember that this was the 1950s and the Production Code was still in full swing. Classical Hollywood female movie types were stereotyped; you either had the Marilyn Monroe, ""blonde bombshell"" or the June Allyson ""sugar and spice"" home-maker without much daylight between. The 1950s filmmakers, mindful of Legion of Decency sanctions and Breen Office imprimatur, would never depict Sally leaving Dutch, consoling herself with another man, or ""hitting the bottle.""The Air Force too, is unlikely to have wanted the Sally personification of S.A.C. family-life to be anything but squeaky-clean. The Pentagon had its own inducements to tow the line:hardware! ""The Strategic Air Command,"" is replete with aeroplane types and establishments way beyond a 1950s film budget, a sure sign of Pentagon script approval. Kubrick's Dr.Stangelove by contrast, had to base its B52 interiors on a single photograph and hearsay, a reasonable indication I'd say, that the brass did not see the joke in the crazy Jack D. Ripper sending his bombers to attack Russia in retribution them ""sapping his precious bodily fluids,"" in a communist conspiracy!Anyway, as a boy at the Saturday matinee, such dazzling displays of air force hardware would destracted me such ""adult considerations."" I loved the virtual reality flying in the B36 with Stewart and Harry Morgan(M.A.S.H.); from the spectacular firing up of the huge props, to the final return to base. The camera had free range aboard the B36 from its ""greenhouse"" cockpit, along its 80'long communication tunnel to the out-the-window shots of those huge three engines in the rear compartment.Then there were the spectacular stratospheric shots of the B36 with con-trails against red sunsets and flying through clouds. Here was a vignette that concealed an aspect of the cold war that I didn't grasp as a boy.In 1955 it was not easy to get people to accept the need for disruption to their lives through military service. A common complaint in the film from the officers was, ""anyway, we're not in a war"" and ""I've already done my share""  and the film also illustrates  the difficulty in retaining enlisted men pressured by too long hours of duty away from home and family.This action all takes place against what have become historic shots of vanished B36, B47 and Globemaster II aeroplanes. Yet the very depictions of such air power involved walking a tight-rope between reassuring Americans and alarming the Russians. Any fool would have anticipated that The Strategic Air Command, as a display of American air power, would have been screened in the Kremlin; so notice that Stewart's detailed B36 inspection never included shots of its  4 pop-up twin cannons. The narrative emphasis was on ""we have to be combat ready 24 hours a day in case the 'other fellow' (?) starts something""... Strategic Air Command rhetoric for 'our preparations are purely defensive against a threat from the sky by a gereralised enemy'. The Russians are NEVER mentioned by name.The film ends with Stewart leaving S.A.C. through injury, but having fufilled a role of boosting moral and encouraging re-enlistment. ""Dutch"", with Allyson resting his head on his chest, looks longing up at soaring B47's - the same ending as ""The Hunters"", but with Mae Britt hugging Robert Mitcham and a filght of F86's. I also had a problem with tough guy Robert Mitchum slapping a man's face for make an ""improper suggestion"" - the scoundrel offered his wife in exchange for a shot at the top North Korean MIG-15 pilot. The Prodution Code strikes again!Where does Scotty come into this? Not Scotty from Star Trek, but Scotty from ""The Thing"" (1951) Scotty's has the last words in the film, ""keep watching the skies"". The first line in the crawl in Strategic Air Command are ""today America is watching her skies"" The threat in both films comes from the skies.Let us see ""The Strategic Air Command"" film out on DVD soon, hope fully with the episode of ""My Three Sons"" where Stewart, in Brigadier-General uniform, appears in the last scene to give a speech you can decide on for yourselves.",3,Scotty watches the

To avoid Thermonuclear War-the United States needed to be fully prepared to wage such a contest in an instant.  Thus the movie, Strategic Air Command (SAC), is deliberately written Cold War Propaganda film that showcases the American ability to carry out such an action.Enter Dutch (Jimmy Stewart).  Dutch is a baseball professional who is called back to active duty as a bomber pilot.  His new job-flying a B-36.  During this time, the lesson raises the following points:1.  The women of SAC are taken care of.  Dutch's wife, Sally (June Allyson) has a baby while he is in the service.2.  SAC has the ability to call pilots and crew from the well trained civilian reserves.3.  The B-36 has a long range-Dutch flies to Alaska and Greenland.4.  SAC's security forces are a second-to-none, by the book force.Dutch is injured in a crash in Greenland but hides his injury so he can continue to fly. He is promoted and learns to fly the new B-47.  During this leg of the movie the following capabilities are featured:1.  All weather bombing by radar, continuously practiced by the men of SAC.2.  Deployment of bombers and equipment to forward locations, quickly and by air.3.  Mid-Air refueling.During a long flight to Japan, Dutch's injury returns.  He lands his aircraft safely but he feels he can no-longer fly.  He is released from Active Duty and returns to manage baseball.On the whole the movie's script seems to have been carefully screened by General Curtis LeMay-the fiery commander of SAC.  As propaganda, this movie is first rate, but as a story, it is a collection of dry statistics, overused clich&eacute;s, and worn out punch lines.  It is warfare-albeit cold warfare-suburbanized and grey.

124020,A1ZQOCT4USN8SU,0792109309,C. Balducci,"[6, 7]","Ostensibly a movie starring James Stewart and June Allyson, the actors and plot of &quot;Strategic Air Command&quot; are, in my opinion, secondary to the real star - the United States Air Force in all of its bright-trimmed, bare-metal-finished mid-1950s glory (not a hint of camoflague or stealth technology in sight)!  This was filmed in the twilight of the propeller-driven era, at the beginning of the Jet Age, and the attempt to combine the two technologies is best represented in the Convair B-36 Peacemaker, which would soon give way to the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress (The smaller Boeing B-47 Stratojet represents the B-36s replacement in this movie).

The cold war is heating up and Dutch uproots his newlywed wife Sally (June Allyson) from their glamorous lifestyle to one of long hours and dangerous training missions.  After over 20 months on active duty, SAC and Dutch's loyalty begin to severely strain their marriage.The movie is mostly a SAC promotional feature for the American public in 1955, and an honest tribute to the people who served in such assignments to deter nuclear war.  It's an interesting period piece, but the story is melodramatic when compared to contemporary genre.  Jimmy Stewart is very likeable, as always, and plays his part convincingly as a reluctant veteran who gives up a successful civilian career for a demanding Air Force job.  Also notable are some very nice flight scenes of the famous B-36 Peacemaker, a monstrous ten-engine bomber that served as America's front-line deterrent before the advent of B-52s and intercontinental ballistic missiles.  The B-47 Stratojet is also featured in the latter part of the movie when Dutch's squadron transitions to the newer aircraft.A unique attraction with this feature is that Stewart actually served as a bomber pilot and operations officer in World War II, with twenty combat missions to his credit (The Jimmy Stewart Museum website).

The B-47, which is more the star of this film than Jimmy Stewart, was America's first true jet bomber in the Cold War and the most beautiful jet ever made. It was a short-lived stopgap between the postwar B-36 and the still in service B-52, the most enduring weapon of the Cold War or just about any other period in history.In the film, Jimmy Stewart gets recalled from pro baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals to air duty and has some angst with his wife over it. She wants him home, not out fighting communisits. He did enough of that during the war, she says. By contrast, the Air Force loves him and thinks he's great, especially his boss, Frank Lovejoy. They say he's a fine pilot with magnificent leadership qualities. Stewart has some internal dissension over this and determines which way he'll go with it -- to his wife's chagrin. Later action in the film makes that decision for him, however.There, I talked about the movie. Now back to the B-47. It's smoky and steamy takeoffs are a thing of real beauty and are exploited to the maximum in Strategic Air Command. Those takeoffs always reminds me of life in the 1950s living next to the railroad tracks when the steam engines would roar through our little town 100 MPH carrying 60 boxcars. They'd spew so much steam and soot in the air the clothes hanging on my mom's outdoor clothesline would have to washed again!For those on you that have never seen this movie or the B-47, it was a lovely, silver, swept-wing combat bomber that used outriggers under the engines to steady it -- since it only had two large sets of wheels under the front and back. This added much to the beauty and line of the aircraft.Back to the movie -- this is hardly Jimmy Stewart's greatest film; it probably isn't among his 25 greatest films. I thought the action and plot somewhat stilted and deliberate, actually. Not much ever happens until the final scene when there's action on a plane and Stewart does his best to make you act as worried as he seems to be. But it's faux danger, we all know that. Otherwise, there is nothing to distinguish this from any other mediocre peacetime Cold War-era film made that decade.It is, however, the best way ever to see lots of B-47s and see them in action. To me, that is the enduring feature of Strategic Air Command.

It was hard work to make things happen and this picture is dedicated to the character and dedication of those individuals who protected this country during the Cold War.

124038,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,0792109309,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[64, 64]","For many of us, the cold war now seems impossibly far away. However, for those of us whose fathers were in the military during the peak of the cold war, the concern was always that we could be attacked at any moment by the Soviet Union.Our first line of defense, before our missiles became more accurate, was huge bombers. When these aircraft flew, their power and size seemed awe-inspiring. Looking back at this movie, the B-36 now seems ungainly and incredibly complex. The B-47 seems less ungainly, but technology has clearly superceded both these aircraft.This movie comes across as a recruiting film for the Air Force, and to a certain extent a patriotic film justifying our strategic air forces. The plot is relatively simple, and trying to spice it up with a sub-story regarding Jimmy Stewart's career as a baseball player and his relationship with his wife becomes a distraction. The focus of this movie is flying big bombers.What gloriously complex aircraft these were. The scenes showing the takeoff of the B-36 are incredible. For airplane enthusiasts, the portion of the film focusing on the reading of the checklist is unusual (because for most people it would seem boring) and unique. Watching how the plane is powered up is nearly worth the exercise of watching the film.Later we get to watch as the B-47 is transitioned into the active military. We watch as the B-47 is flown in poor weather conditions, and watch fatigue and boredom set in as crews flew incredibly lengthy missions.Some of the most interesting and now somewhat anachronistic parts of the movie are those portions dealing with the functioning of Strategic Air Command (SAC) bases. These bases were very highly protected, and exercises were continuously run to assure that saboteurs or an enemy invading force would be repelled by base security forces. During their period of duty, crews were either in the air or standing by on alert, ready to jump in their plane and be airborne in less than 15 minutes. I remember well an exercise called a ""total recall"" where every member of the base is called to duty to be prepared for a possible enemy attack.While the parts of the movie dealing with Jimmy Stewart the baseball player and husband are relative distractions, they do point out the sacrifice that many people made to be in the military at that time. Military aircraft were huge and complex, and tended to break down a lot. The missions were incredibly long, and the flight systems were relatively crude, requiring fatiguing concentration. For all the hardship of flying, the pay was low and often the working conditions, including the noise and cold (military aircraft are generally not well-insulated - note how the flight crew is dressed; it was cold up there) were uncomfortable to say the least.This movie is a rarity that is close to being a historical artifact. While some of the operational details are simplified, in general the scenes depicted are relatively accurate. Further, the scenes with the aircraft are rare and detailed. Forget the plot of this movie; it's about the airplanes, Jimmy Stewart's love of flying, and a time that was not so far away.",4,Historically Accurate; watch it for the aircraft,1053475200,"05 21, 2003",2003,3151,"['many', 'cold', 'war', 'now', 'impossibly', 'far', 'away', 'However', 'fathers', 'were', 'military', 'peak', 'cold', 'war', 'concern', 'was', 'always', 'could', 'be', 'attacked', 'moment', 'Soviet', 'Union.Our', 'first', 'line', 'defense', 'missiles', 'became', 'more', 'accurate', 'was', 'huge', 'bombers', 'When', 'aircraft', 'flew', 'power', 'size', 'seemed', 'awe-inspiring', 'Looking', 'back', 'movie', 'B-36', 'now', 'ungainly', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'B-47', 'less', 'ungainly', 'technology', 'clearly', 'superceded', 'aircraft.This', 'movie', 'across', 'recruiting', 'film', 'Air', 'Force', 'certain', 'extent', 'patriotic', 'film', 'justifying', 'strategic', 'air', 'forces', 'plot', 'relatively', 'simple', 'trying', 'spice', 'up', 'sub-story', 'regarding', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'career', 'baseball', 'player', 'relationship', 'wife', 'distraction', 'focus', 'movie', 'flying', 'big', 'bombers.What', 'gloriously', 'complex', 'aircraft', 'were', 'scenes', 'showing', 'takeoff', 'B-36', 'are', 'incredible', 'airplane', 'enthusiasts', 'portion', 'film', 'focusing', 'reading', 'checklist', 'unusual', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'seem', 'boring', 'unique', 'Watching', 'how', 'plane', 'powered', 'up', 'nearly', 'worth', 'exercise', 'watching', 'film.Later', 'get', 'watch', 'B-47', 'transitioned', 'active', 'military', 'watch', 'B-47', 'flown', 'poor', 'weather', 'conditions', 'watch', 'fatigue', 'boredom', 'set', 'crews', 'flew', 'incredibly', 'lengthy', 'missions.Some', 'most', 'interesting', 'now', 'somewhat', 'anachronistic', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'portions', 'dealing', 'functioning', 'Strategic', 'Air', 'Command', 'SAC', 'bases', 'were', 'very', 'highly', 'protected', 'exercises', 'were', 'continuously', 'run', 'assure', 'saboteurs', 'enemy', 'invading', 'force', 'would', 'be', 'repelled', 'base', 'security', 'forces', 'period', 'duty', 'crews', 'were', 'either', 'air', 'standing', 'alert', 'ready', 'jump', 'plane', 'be', 'airborne', 'less', '15', 'minutes', 'remember', 'well', 'exercise', 'called', 'total', 'recall', 'where', 'member', 'base', 'called', 'duty', 'be', 'prepared', 'possible', 'enemy', 'parts', 'movie', 'dealing', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'baseball', 'player', 'husband', 'are', 'relative', 'distractions', 'do', 'point', 'out', 'sacrifice', 'many', 'people', 'made', 'be', 'military', 'time', 'Military', 'aircraft', 'were', 'huge', 'complex', 'tended', 'break', 'down', 'lot', 'missions', 'were', 'incredibly', 'long', 'flight', 'systems', 'were', 'relatively', 'crude', 'requiring', 'fatiguing', 'concentration', 'hardship', 'flying', 'pay', 'was', 'low', 'often', 'working', 'conditions', 'including', 'noise', 'cold', 'military', 'aircraft', 'are', 'generally', 'not', 'well-insulated', 'note', 'how', 'flight', 'crew', 'dressed', 'was', 'cold', 'up', 'there', 'were', 'uncomfortable', 'say', 'least.This', 'movie', 'rarity', 'close', 'being', 'historical', 'artifact', 'operational', 'details', 'are', 'simplified', 'general', 'scenes', 'depicted', 'are', 'relatively', 'accurate', 'Further', 'scenes', 'aircraft', 'are', 'rare', 'detailed', 'Forget', 'plot', 'movie', 'airplanes', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'love', 'flying', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'far', 'away']",N/A

124040,ATSWIYN2BJDVP,0792109309,Movie and Music lover!,"[10, 11]","I agree with some of the previous reviewers who criticized June Allyson's character. I have always been a fan of June, but this part was rather immature. However, to be fair to the character, when she married ""Dutch,"" he was a baseball player, not an Air Force pilot. It could be conceivable for anyone to be frustrated under the same conditions. I did find her character to be a bit boring though, and I grew very tired of all the self-pity.Jimmy Stewart's character on the other hand was brave and patriotic. It somewhat mirrors what the real-life Jimmy Stewart did, when in the 1940's during the height of his Hollywood career, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. He was (and still is to this day) the highest ranking officer-actor ever to serve in the military (he became a Colonel on active duty in the Air Force, then joined the Air Force Reserves and retired from the military as a Brigadier General). Nowadays, since Hollywood leans so far to the left, it is unlikely that anyone will ever break that record. I cannot imagine a top star in the year 2005 (let's say Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt) to leave Hollywood for Iraq.The aeriel footage was breathtakingly beautiful.

124041,A1UGBAB06ML2E6,0792109309,"MUSICPOET ""AURORAS4444""","[6, 6]","STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND is the greatest air thriller of alltime! A PICTURE WITH A FORCE SECOND TO NONE!!!! A powerful, stirring music score by VICTOR YOUNG accompaines this classic! The story of air superiority in the western world, and the prepardness of the Strategic Air Command, gives new meaning to the majestic skies above!  Starring with my favorite plane of alltime, the grand Convair B-36 Peacemakers, and the graceful Boeing B-47 Stratojets that take to the skies in an effort to keep peace in the world! This was the only motion picture ever filmed with grand B-36s!!!! Especially exciting was the low executed flyover of a B-36, at Al Lang Field, Tampa, Florida at the opening scenes of STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND! Then came the spectacular majestic aerial scenery of the B-36 (#5734), as it flew from Carswell AFB, Fort Worth, Texas (the home of the B-36s) to Alaska and back. The aerial scenes took my breath away! The music played for this sequence was SKY SYMPHONY, which really opened your eyes, not only to this powerful Convair B-36 Peacemaker in flight, but the role that Strategic Air Command played in global security 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! The story was inspired by the Ted Williams recall to the marines!JAMES STEWART plays former Col. Roert Dutch Holland, a third baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals who at the height of his career (signing a $70,000 a year contract), is suddenly recalled back to active duty with the U.S. Air Force and assigned to the Strategic Air Command for 21 months of active duty. His job is to help SAC to be combat ready, in peacetime activity, before war comes again! His wife JUNE ALLYSON (Sally Holland) doesn't fare much as a air force wife, but she yet to find out that she also pregnant. Under the command of FRANK LOVEJOY (General Ennis H. Hawkes), Dutch tries to get the feel of SAC, meeting a former B-29 crew member HARRY MORGAN (Sgt. Bible), a former friend for WWII BRUCE BENNETT (General Rusty Castle) and other officers JAMES MILLIGAN Gen. Espy), and BARRY SULLIVAN (as copilot Rocky Sanford). He even teams up with an disguntled navigator ALEX NICOL (Ike Nolan), as part of a B-36 pickup training crew. Fate deals a bad hand when the B-36 they're flying to Greenland for cold weather tests, crashlands on the frozen tundra completely breaking apart. (The B-36 had a very damaging engine fire!) The special-effects of the B-36 crashlanding were memorable, much like the crashlandings of the spaceship JUPITER 2 in the TV series LOST IN SPACE! The crashlanding results in Dutch experiencing a serious shoulder injury, which unfortunately he neglects through the rest of the film! An injury that will be his undoing! Rescued along with Ike, Dutch not only has to face his commanding general Hawkes, but also returns home to Carswell AFB, to see that his wife Sally has given birth to a baby girl. He now recieves a new assignment to fly B-47 Stratojets at Mc Dill AFB, Tampa, Florida. The sequence of the B-47 using RATO is aweinspiring!When the call comes to fly an oversea flight to Japan, Dutch  recieves word that a player named Brewster, broke his leg, and an opening is needed to be filled. Dutch reluctant of being part of SAC at the start, now believes that being there is more important than finishing his baseball career, and immediately signs up with the USAF and the Strategic Air Command permanently! When he breaks the news to Sally she becomes very tearful and upset, and races over to catch Dutch before he takes with 45 other B-47s. She angrily berates Gen. Hawkes, while Gen Castle is there. She soon regrets her behavior! Dutch continues to fly, but has to land his B-47 at Kadena AFB, in Okinawa, due to inclement weather. Ther is a breataking sequence of the midair refueling of the B-47 from Boeing KC-97 tanker!!!! While attempting to land at Kadena AFB, his neglected shoulder injury acts up paralizing his right side, and forcing an emergency landing in pouring rain. This was the 2nd special effects of STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND, and it too was great to watch! Dutch is fnally discharged at Offutt AFB (the headquarters of SAC), in Omaha, Nebraska by Gen Hawkes, and enters the waiting arms of his wife Sally who has come to see him. They makes their apoplgies, and embrace as a flight of B-47s fly overhead, thus ending the film. Two other music selections are noted: the majestic THE AIR FORCE TAKES COMMAND, played durung the opening credits; and the tender memorable love song THE WORLD IS MINE played with great feeling during the bedroom sequence as Dutch leaves Sally to fly to Greenland! All the music I love and especially love to hear THE WORLD IS MINE. STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND takes off to a new realm of high flying adventure and drama. There will never be a film like it ever! It's one will treasure always! A piece of americana and heritage to cherish forever!!!!",5,SPECTACULAR!

Nethken,"[1, 1]","Being an ex-MAC ""grunt"", flight engineer on the C-5A and C-141A/B located at Travis AFB, CA, I was in my early years, a SAC tailgunner on the B-52/D located at Sheppard AFB, Texas. It was then the 459th Strategic Bomb Wing. The displays in the ""Command Post"" coincided with our command post at Travis.  The ""no-notice"" Operational Rediness Inspection (ORI) was very accurate.  Yes, the inspection team would sneak in at the ungodly hour of 0300; (3:00AM for you non military); walk up to the locked door at the CP and say exactly what Gen Kirby said in the movie. These ORI's, even a no notice was very intense.  The preplanned ORI was a different ballgame.  We had time to prepare for the ORI while the no notice is exactly what it means; ""no-notice""!!  The preparation was very well enhanced with the stark reality of what it would be like in a national emergency.  Even the alert ""barns"" used by the aircrews, which were common on most SAC and MAC bases was very well portrayed in AGOE!  Time was critical from the moment the klaxon horn sounded the alert to the very moment the BUFF(B52 nickname) broke ground; usually ten minutes, but the Wing Commander demanded far less time to exercise the launch sequence; seven minutes or in many cases much less!  The movie was very accurate and denoted the real intense routine that was common in these types of military exercises. Being retired Air Force for almost 20 years, it still evokes the kinship with the crews, maintenance personnel and the ""brass"" who ensured ontime procedures for these dramatic exercises. Oh to be on the flight deck of my Starlifter going somewhere I never been before. Fond memories I will never forget!!! Outstanding movie to say the least!!! To bad it is not on DVD for the US yet but I am sure one day it will be!!!!  This is a short note to notice that this review was really for A Gathering of Eagles with Rock Hudson. I am sure someone will notice my error but if you do and were in the Air Force, you will allow me my error.

He even got married to a beautiful and loving woman named Sally (June Allyson). One day, just when things are looking good for the family, he's asked to leave his job and join the Air Force again. Sally doesn't think he will, but he agrees quickly and loves his job. Despite the danger involved with flying, Dutch takes to it like a duck in water. He soon becomes in charge of his own crew, much to the chagrin of his wife.This movie boasts its airplanes quite a lot and its popular cast not as much. In fact, Stewart requested to make this movie because of his own time in the Air Force during the war. He is excellent in the film, and doesn't seem to mind taking second billing to all of the aircraft. It is Allyson who suffers in a small role with little to do.

It stars James Stewart, June Allyson, Frank Lovejoy, Bruce Bennett and Barry Sullivan. Music is by Victor Young and cinematography by William H. Daniels.Film is inspired in part by the true story of baseball great Ted Williams, who after serving in World War II was drafted to serve in the Korean War just as his baseball career was taking off.There's sometimes a film you watch that you desperately want to be good because you can't imagine having to pan it. This becomes even more irksome when it's directed by and stars personal favourites. Sadly I find myself in that irksome frame of mind where  Strategic Air Command is concerned, for in spite of the quality of Mann and Stewart, and some truly special ""up in the air"" sequences, picture is a bore.The flag waving and thematics involved are fine, these people deserve recognition, and it's great to have someone like Stewart, drawing from real life inspiration, leading out the story, but when on the ground the film comes off as an advertising reel for the Air Force that's punctured by military musings. None of which is very interesting.On the major side of plus points is the planes themselves, those B36/47 Bombers are a sight to behold, graceful yet menacing, and beautifully brought to life in Vista Vision and Technicolor. The ""loyal wife of an airman"" thread is neatly welded  into the human story, with Allyson's chemistry with Stewart set in stone after their work together in The Stratton Story (1949) & TheGlen Miller Story (1954).Hardly a stinker, then, and Lay's story was Oscar Nominated, but it is a chore to get through,  and one has to be suspicious of a film where the best thing about it is an airplane. 4/10",3,Chocs Away-In With The B Bombers.,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,1783,"['Strategic', 'Air', 'Command', 'directed', 'Anthony', 'Mann', 'written', 'Valentine', 'Davies', 'Beirne', 'Lay', 'James', 'Stewart', 'June', 'Allyson', 'Frank', 'Lovejoy', 'Bruce', 'Bennett', 'Barry', 'Sullivan', 'Music', 'Victor', 'Young', 'cinematography', 'William', 'H.', 'Daniels.Film', 'inspired', 'part', 'true', 'story', 'baseball', 'great', 'Ted', 'Williams', 'who', 'serving', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'drafted', 'serve', 'Korean', 'War', 'just', 'baseball', 'career', 'was', 'taking', 'sometimes', 'film', 'watch', 'desperately', 'want', 'be', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'having', 'pan', 'even', 'more', 'irksome', 'when', 'directed', 'stars', 'personal', 'favourites', 'Sadly', 'find', 'irksome', 'frame', 'mind', 'where', 'Strategic', 'Air', 'Command', 'concerned', 'spite', 'quality', 'Mann', 'Stewart', 'truly', 'special', 'up', 'air', 'sequences', 'picture', 'bore.The', 'flag', 'waving', 'thematics', 'involved', 'are', 'fine', 'people', 'deserve', 'recognition', 'great', 'have', 'someone', 'Stewart', 'drawing', 'real', 'life', 'inspiration', 'leading', 'out', 'story', 'when', 'ground', 'film', 'off', 'advertising', 'reel', 'Air', 'Force', 'punctured', 'military', 'musings', 'None', 'very', 'interesting.On', 'major', 'side', 'plus', 'points', 'planes', 'B36/47', 'Bombers', 'are', 'sight', 'behold', 'graceful', 'yet', 'menacing', 'beautifully', 'brought', 'life', 'Vista', 'Vision', 'Technicolor', 'loyal', 'wife', 'airman', 'thread', 'neatly', 'welded', 'human', 'story', 'Allyson', 'chemistry', 'Stewart', 'set', 'stone', 'work', 'together', 'Stratton', 'Story', '1949', 'TheGlen', 'Miller', 'Story', '1954', '.Hardly', 'stinker', 'then', 'Lay', 'story', 'was', 'Oscar', 'Nominated', 'chore', 'get', 'one', 'be', 'suspicious', 'film', 'where', 'best', 'thing', 'airplane', '4/10']",N/A

124052,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,0792109309,trebe,"[2, 6]","Directed by Anthony Mann, Strategic Air Command (1955) is a meandering drama centered on Robert `Dutch' Holland (James Stewart), a pro baseball player whose career is put on hold, when he is recalled into the Air Force, to serve as a bomber pilot.  Initially upset at the unexpected change in his life, Dutch and wife Sally (June Allyson) adjust to military life.  Dutch gets familiar with new types of long range bomber aircraft, and Strategic Air Command's (SAC) global responsibilities.Although it is a time of peace, the film emphasizes the importance of remaining ever vigilant, along worldwide front, and also covers the personal and financial sacrifices, made by those who choose to serve the country in this mission.  With no war to fight, the most exciting incident involves a wing catching on fire, and Dutch crash landing in Greenland, injuring his shoulder.  The injury later becomes a problem, on an extremely long haul flight to Japan, leading to a dramatic landing in poor weather.The film balances the military missions, with some peeks at home life.  Allyson portrays the typical supportive wife, separated from her husband, giving birth to a daughter, while Dutch is on the Greenland mission.  The marriage understandably experiences a crisis, when Dutch reenlists without checking with her.A slow developing film, without much excitement, Strategic Air Command plays like a light promotional for the Air Force, making a case for the necessity to be ever alert to danger, and never letting your guard down.  Stewart as usual is believable and likeable, though perhaps a bit on the older side to be a major league pitcher.
