1336736,A2AT08TWXCEUDR,B003CP62BQ,djfullshred,"[5, 8]","For those who have never seen this, not a review for diehard fans -I liked the first season. It introduced the characters, set up the plot involving a relationship between our male protagonist & beautiful Goddess. It was a cute story that implied a real relationship was heading somewhere romantic. In the first season, our man Keiichi was kind of passive & wimpy towards life, but would rise to be heroic when the time calls. It looked like he would stand up & become a man at some point.If you want to see that relationship progress, forget about it in the follow up season. This season is more episodic with various goofy challenges for Keiichi & the Godess siblings living with him. There is very little relationship progression, and if anything more regression to an unrealistic relationship. After 24 more episodes, Keiichi still doesn't have the sack to even hold hands with or admit any feelings at all to the girlfriend he's lived with for two years. I can go with a lot of silly things in anime, but one thing that really gets under my skin is the repeated use of a loaf of a guy character who is totally passive about everything happening around him constantly causing misunderstanding comedy/drama. They have to make the male protaganist incredibely stupid & wimpy for this plot device to work, turning Keiichi into nothing more than a foil for the plot instead of a realistic person.",3,More of same,1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,1396,"['who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'not', 'review', 'diehard', 'fans', '-I', 'liked', 'first', 'season', 'introduced', 'characters', 'set', 'up', 'plot', 'involving', 'relationship', 'male', 'protagonist', 'beautiful', 'Goddess', 'was', 'cute', 'story', 'implied', 'real', 'relationship', 'was', 'heading', 'somewhere', 'romantic', 'first', 'season', 'man', 'Keiichi', 'was', 'kind', 'passive', 'wimpy', 'towards', 'life', 'would', 'rise', 'be', 'heroic', 'when', 'time', 'looked', 'would', 'stand', 'up', 'become', 'man', 'point.If', 'want', 'see', 'relationship', 'progress', 'forget', 'follow', 'up', 'season', 'season', 'more', 'episodic', 'various', 'goofy', 'challenges', 'Keiichi', 'Godess', 'siblings', 'living', 'very', 'little', 'relationship', 'progression', 'anything', 'more', 'regression', 'unrealistic', 'relationship', '24', 'more', 'episodes', 'Keiichi', 'still', ""n't"", 'have', 'sack', 'even', 'hold', 'hands', 'admit', 'feelings', 'girlfriend', 'lived', 'two', 'years', 'can', 'go', 'lot', 'silly', 'things', 'anime', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'skin', 'repeated', 'use', 'loaf', 'guy', 'character', 'who', 'totally', 'passive', 'everything', 'happening', 'constantly', 'causing', 'misunderstanding', 'comedy/drama', 'have', 'make', 'male', 'protaganist', 'incredibely', 'stupid', 'wimpy', 'plot', 'device', 'work', 'turning', 'Keiichi', 'nothing', 'more', 'foil', 'plot', 'instead', 'realistic', 'person']",N/A

He becomes an even luckier young man in season 2. The sexiest Goddess yet has come to grant him a wish. Somehow he reaches the Goddess help line again, and the Goddess Peorth comes to grant him his wish. Belldandy is upset with this. She feels that since Peorth has come, she may not have granted Keiichi's true wish. Peorth has certainly thrown a wrench in the works. This season has everything season 1 had and more.I have loved the Ah! My Goddess series since it first came out with the short OVA. The second season is great. The animation, and soundtrack are both very good. I think the weakest part of this show is the English Dub. There are definitely better voice actors out there. I prefer to watch things in English. I don't like reading subtitles when I'm trying to watch something at the same time. A lot of people prefer the original language with subs. If you're one of them then this series should give you noting to dislike. Even though I said the English Dub is weak; it doesn't hurt the show either. Overall Ah!

I was introduced to Ah my goddess by watching the Movie before any of the TV Series. The animation was beautiful and I got hooked right away. I have seen the entire series, and I own the Movie, and I gotta tell ya, the 2nd season isn't all that great. The 1st season was wonderful, it had  a good solid story line, you got to learn and love the characters, and it had a good plot to the series. But season 2 is all fluff people. ***SPOILERS*** So Keichi made his wish and he has Belldandy by his side forever, and he is stuck with her two sisters, Urd and Skuld (Urd being older, Skuld being younger than Belldandy) So anyway, all is well and pretty much the entire second season is about Keichi telling Belldandy how much he loves her, which we all already know because he has told her, and we fans are pretty observant and know they love each other.So the second season is just 25 episodes of showing everyday life with Keichi and Belldandy, and a little bit of drama every other episode or so.So, after that exhaustive review, my advice would be to go and buy/ watch season 1, buy/ watch the AH My Goddess Movie, and be content because season 2 is nothing more than fluff with more fluff.This anime does have great animation, and the movie is done very well. The music and voice actors are well cast, so I do enjoy this anime.
