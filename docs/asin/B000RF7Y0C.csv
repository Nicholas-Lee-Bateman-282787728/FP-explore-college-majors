""Snowcone! Whole snowcone for half game!"" He's a great guy, and his humor is something you can enjoy with everyone.If you own his live CD or earlier DVD, you'll find this contains almost all new material. One of the bonus features is his encore in which he does requests from the audience from his material. It's stuff you've heard before, but the funny way he points that out is hilarious (""You're out there going, 'Yep, that's the way I memorized it.'"") His first Comedy Central Presents appearance is included and there's no repeats from the ""Standing Up"" special in it. If this is your first introduction to Brian's comedy, it's a great place to start. Grab his live CD next. The CC Presents half-hour show has some of that material on it, but it's still funny.I wish there were more comedians out there like Brian. He manages to be funny without ever being vulgar. I don't know why he isn't more popular, but with his CC sponsored national tour maybe he'll finally get the exposure he deserves.Keep up the great work, Brian!",5,Funny and clean,1188000000,"08 25, 2007",2007,1166,"['Brian', 'Regan', 'great', 'comedian', 'whole', 'family', 'wife', 'kids', 'love', 'walking', 'house', 'yelling', 'What', 'score', 'Brian', 'Snowcone', 'Whole', 'snowcone', 'half', 'game', 'great', 'guy', 'humor', 'something', 'can', 'enjoy', 'everyone.If', 'own', 'live', 'CD', 'earlier', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'find', 'almost', 'new', 'material', 'One', 'bonus', 'encore', 'requests', 'audience', 'material', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'funny', 'way', 'out', 'hilarious', ""'re"", 'out', 'there', 'going', ""'Yep"", 'way', 'memorized', 'first', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Presents', 'appearance', 'included', 'repeats', 'Standing', 'Up', 'special', 'first', 'introduction', 'Brian', 'comedy', 'great', 'place', 'start', 'Grab', 'live', 'CD', 'next', 'CC', 'Presents', 'half-hour', 'show', 'material', 'still', 'funny.I', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'comedians', 'there', 'Brian', 'be', 'funny', 'ever', 'being', 'vulgar', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', ""n't"", 'more', 'popular', 'CC', 'sponsored', 'national', 'tour', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'finally', 'get', 'exposure', 'up', 'great', 'work', 'Brian']",Brian Regan: Standing Up

I was delighted to find a comic who was not only hilarious but clean. Brian is able to take everyday incidents and relate them in a manner so funny that it really must be seen to be appreciated. As an airline pilot, I was especially amused by his observations on the world of commercial aviation: a typical announcement from the Captain explaining a delay turns into ""...Somebody put our engine in upside down, and there's only one tool in our galaxy that can fix this, and it's in Madagascar."" (The discussion of the ""essentials kit"" is also not to be missed.)Brian talks about his kids and children's entertainment quite a bit. I was very fond of the routines involving a pitch meeting for the song ""I'm the Map"" on ""Dora the Explorer,"" as well as family outings to kid-friendly places (""Could there be a less stressful job than working in a butterfly pavilion?"") Popular culture is rightly skewered from political advertisements, to brainless members of the press corps, and even highbrow PBS favorite ""Nova,"" all to great effect.The special is only about 40 minutes long, but fear not, there are good DVD extras, including the encore from the live show and a 30 minute Comedy Central special with great and totally different material.
