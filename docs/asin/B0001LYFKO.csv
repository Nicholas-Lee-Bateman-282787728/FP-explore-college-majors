810293,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0001LYFKO,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 5]","In a time when I, among others, are questioning where the extra-parliamentary opposition to the Iraq War is going and why it has not made more of an impact on American society it was rather refreshing to view this documentary about the seemingly forgotten Weather Underground that as things got grimmer dramatically epitomized one aspect of opposition to the Vietnam War. If opposition to the Iraq war is the political fight of my old age Vietnam was the fight of my youth and in this film brought back very strong memories of why I fought tooth and nail against it. And the people portrayed in this film, the core of the Weather Underground, while not politically kindred spirits then or now, were certainly on the same page as I was- a no holds- barred fight against the American Empire. We lost that round, and there were reasons for that, but that kind of attitude is what it takes to bring down the monster. But a revolutionary strategy is needed. That is where we parted company.One of the political highlights of the film is centered on the 1969 Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) Convention that was a watershed in the student anti-war protest movement. That was the genesis of the Weathermen but it was also the genesis of the Progressive Labor Party-led faction that wanted to bring the anti-war message to the working class by linking up the student movement with the fight against capitalism. In short, to get to those who were, or were to be, the rank and file soldiers in Vietnam or who worked in the factories. In either case the point that was missed , as the Old Left had argued all along and which we had previously dismissed out of hand,  was that it was the masses of working people who were central to `bringing the war home'  and the fight against capitalism. That task still confronts us today.One of the paradoxical things about this film is that the Weather Underground survivors interviewed had only a vague notion about what went wrong. This was clearly detailed in the remarks of Mark Rudd, a central leader, when he stated that the Weathermen were trying to create a communist cadre. He also stated, however, that after going underground he realized that he was out of the loop as far as being politically effective. And that is the point. There is no virtue in underground activity if it is not necessary, romantic as that may be. To the extent that any of us read history in those days it was certainly not about the origins of the Russian revolutionary movement in the 19th century. If we had we would have found that the above-mentioned fight in 1969 was also fought out by that movement. Mass action vs. individual acts, heroic or otherwise, of terror. The Weather strategy of acting as the American component of the world-wide revolutionary movement to bring the Empire to its knees certainly had (and still does) have a very appealing quality. However, a moral gesture did not (and will not) bring this beast down. While the Weather Underground was made up a small group of very appealing subjective revolutionaries its political/moral strategy led to a dead end. The lesson to be learned; you most definitely do need weather people to know which way the winds blow.

The Weather Underground is largely forgotten,compared to the Summer of Love in '68,or the Black Panthers. They started out as starry-eyed idealists in Chicago who wanted peace,racial equality,and the end of the Vietnam War. The Weather Underground was mainly composed of privileged white students who championed the causes of the poor and minorities. They decided to be ""revolutionary."" This documentary walks the fine line when it comes to their seemingly admirable causes and their terrible actions.""The Weather Underground"" starts with starry-eyed idealism,but the ""revolution"" becomes ugly. As Todd Gitlin,a former member of SDS (Students for a Democratic Society) says,they came to the point where mass murder was considered a viable option. Former Weathermen David Rudd and Brian Flanagan (the former won on Jeopardy! recently,the latter is a barkeeper) have repented of their actions. For the Weathermen,""revolution"" came to mean destroying property,and perhaps lives,in the process. They went from ""make love,not war"" to making war on civilians. They blew up the Haymarket statue several times. While they claim they only destroyed property and spared people,they injured their victims;as a result,a judge was paralyzed from the neck down and a policeman was killed. The Weathermen thought their actions were justifiable because of the Vietnam War. The Weather Underground seriously thought bombing the Pentagon would somehow lead to peace.The Weather Underground wanted a Communist revolution in the US. They found inspiration in Cuba. They wanted to redefine society,with slogans such as ""Smash Monogamy!"" (it's ironic to see Weatherman William Ayers&Bernadine; Dohrn living a bourgeois family life,instead of being in a commune)""Weather Underground"" is still a relevant documentary today. Former Weathermen like Mark Rudd and Brian Flanagan have matured,soberly seeing their idealism gone profoundly wrong. Others,like William Ayers (now a professor) and Bernadine Dohrn (now leading a child&family; services project),justify their actions. They reminisce glowingly about the ""Days of Rage.""

Still this film is very good and I highly recommend.They interview many members including David Gilbert, who is currently incarcerated for activities after the Weather days.

The Vietnam War and the state repression of the Black Panthers were some of the issues against which the Weathermen protested in this ultimately unproductive manner. (The Timothy Leary incident is apparently exaggerated.)

A few made the mistake of joining other illegal armed groups, eventually ending up in prison.The program is a good overview, regardless of how you might feel about the people involved and their political tactics.

810304,AS558SNWF1DXG,B0001LYFKO,Clare Quilty,"[8, 10]","Shocking, engrossing, enlightening and ultimately heartbreaking, &quot;The Weather* Underground&quot; is a new documentary that should probably be seen by just about anybody who doesn't know its story and is at all interested in America and its past, present and future.The movie is a brief history of the Weathermen, a radical group of anti-war, anti-racism protesters who, in the 1960s, splintered off from the Students for a Democratic Society and, as the Vietnam War grew and grew, became more and more aggressive in its tactics.I knew a little about the group beforehand but had no idea that, for example, its members once bombed the U.S. Capitol. They also set off explosives at a New York City police headquarters, the Presidio in San Francisco, a Queens courthouse, a National Guard headquarters and at an office of the New York Department of Corrections, among other targets.These actions are shocking and wrong in and of themselves, but in a post-9/11 environment, they take on an even larger sense of menace. But it's to the movie's credit that it's able to present these situations in a historical context without supporting or completely condemning the young people involved. Sam Green, with co-director Bill Siegel, strongly object to the methods of the Weathermen but are obviously and understandably sympathetic to the opinions and despair that motivated them.&quot;Every second, from 1965 to 1975, I was always aware that our country was attacking Vietnam,&quot; says former Weatherman Mark Rudd. &quot;Our country was killing millions of people in Vietnam . . . This revelation was more than we could handle. We didn't know what to do about it.&quot;Later, he adds, &quot;I helped found an organization whose goal was the violent overthrow of the government of the United States.&quot;Says Brian Flanagan, another ex-Weatherman (who, incidentally, once won $23,000 on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;), &quot;When you feel you have right on your side, you can do some horrific things.&quot;Somehow, Green and Siegel managed to find and interview many of the other key participants, and the stark contrast between the Weathermen today and their old mug shots is striking -- some have rethought their actions while some seem just as committed now as then. But the tragic figures of the movie aren't just a group of young people whose enthusiasm and outrage led them astray, nor are they those that the group lashed out against, but everybody involved. &quot;The Weather Underground&quot; is a sad snapshot of a time that still resonates today.The commentary by director Green is an extremely well-done track. Green is very adept at opening up the movie and explaining things that the film itself doesn't have time to go into detail about.",5,A sad snapshot that still resonates today,1086912000,"06 11, 2004",2004,2743,"['Shocking', 'engrossing', 'enlightening', 'ultimately', 'heartbreaking', 'quot', 'Weather*', 'Underground', 'quot', 'new', 'documentary', 'should', 'probably', 'be', 'seen', 'just', 'anybody', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'interested', 'America', 'past', 'present', 'future.The', 'movie', 'brief', 'history', 'Weathermen', 'radical', 'group', 'anti-war', 'anti-racism', 'protesters', 'who', '1960s', 'splintered', 'off', 'Students', 'Democratic', 'Society', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'grew', 'grew', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'aggressive', 'tactics.I', 'knew', 'little', 'group', 'beforehand', 'had', 'idea', 'example', 'members', 'once', 'bombed', 'U.S.', 'Capitol', 'also', 'set', 'off', 'explosives', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'police', 'headquarters', 'Presidio', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Queens', 'courthouse', 'National', 'Guard', 'headquarters', 'office', 'New', 'York', 'Department', 'Corrections', 'other', 'targets.These', 'actions', 'are', 'shocking', 'wrong', 'post-9/11', 'environment', 'take', 'even', 'larger', 'sense', 'menace', 'movie', 'credit', 'able', 'present', 'situations', 'historical', 'context', 'supporting', 'completely', 'condemning', 'young', 'people', 'involved', 'Sam', 'Green', 'co-director', 'Bill', 'Siegel', 'strongly', 'object', 'methods', 'Weathermen', 'are', 'obviously', 'understandably', 'sympathetic', 'opinions', 'despair', 'motivated', 'them.', 'quot', 'Every', 'second', '1965', '1975', 'was', 'always', 'aware', 'country', 'was', 'attacking', 'Vietnam', 'quot', 'former', 'Weatherman', 'Mark', 'Rudd', 'quot', 'country', 'was', 'killing', 'millions', 'people', 'Vietnam', 'revelation', 'was', 'more', 'could', 'handle', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'it.', 'quot', 'Later', 'quot', 'helped', 'found', 'organization', 'goal', 'was', 'violent', 'overthrow', 'government', 'United', 'States.', 'quot', 'Brian', 'Flanagan', 'ex-Weatherman', 'who', 'incidentally', 'once', 'won', '23,000', 'quot', 'Jeopardy', 'quot', 'quot', 'When', 'feel', 'have', 'right', 'side', 'can', 'do', 'horrific', 'things.', 'quot', 'Somehow', 'Green', 'Siegel', 'managed', 'find', 'interview', 'many', 'other', 'key', 'participants', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Weathermen', 'today', 'old', 'mug', 'shots', 'striking', 'have', 'rethought', 'actions', 'seem', 'just', 'committed', 'now', 'then', 'tragic', 'figures', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'enthusiasm', 'outrage', 'led', 'astray', 'are', 'group', 'lashed', 'out', 'everybody', 'involved', 'quot', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'quot', 'sad', 'snapshot', 'time', 'still', 'today.The', 'commentary', 'director', 'Green', 'extremely', 'well-done', 'track', 'Green', 'very', 'adept', 'opening', 'up', 'movie', 'explaining', 'things', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'go', 'detail']",The Weather Underground

It gives little context to why these people would give up the privileges most poor people, black or white, strive for. Could it be, like many bad artists, they believe nobility is to be found in struggle? Ask anyone who's really struggled and they'll consider that view nave, at best, and pornographic, at worst. The Weather Underground started out in 1969 as a splinter group from the Students for  Democratic Society (SDS) called the Weathermen (taken from the lyrics of a Bob Dylan song: `you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows'. They started bombing buildings as `acts of protest', yet were ridiculed by the Black Panthers as a bunch of spoiled white kids who made things tougher for them because they were unskilled. The Weathermen were also reviled by mainstream liberal and anti-war groups as making their points of view seem unpalatable to the moderates in the nation. Ironically, they were seen basically as useful idiots by President Nixon and the Right Wing.Unlike, say ex-Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, in The Fog Of War, only a few of the group seem to have gained any wisdom. Rudd states, `I cherished my hate as a badge of moral superiority', and Flanagan seems to rightly see how close he came to being bin Laden, when he states, `If you think that you have the moral high ground, that's a very dangerous position and you can do some really dreadful things.' A still bitter ex-SDS leader named Todd Gitlin also perfectly nails the ethical morass of the Weathermen, and much of the most radicalized Left, when he states, `They were ready to be mass murderers, the same as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, and their grand projects for the reform of all humanity. In the face of that, ordinary life was dispensable.'As a film, there are several clever sequences of recreations, that Green recounts well in the DVD commentary, and the lack of funding for the film worked in its favor in at least one aspect. Failing to have the money for classic 1960s rock songs, the film used eerie avant-garde music, which adds to the delusion of the ideas many of the talking heads provide. Overall, the film is a so-so concoction, and the comments add little. A half hour interview with murderer David Gilbert adds little insight, save that the man still has not gotten his act together, and an art film on the terrorists adds even less insight. Overall, the bonus features are rather meager. This film breaks no new ground on the times, nor artistically, and just underscores that the folks involved in any terror movement are not good people, despite their protestations to the contrary. If only Mystery Science Theater 3000 were still around to lampoon this film there might be a good commentary available.

The peaceful protests and activism that was the hallmark of the 60's, in the views of the members of the Weather Underground were ""ineffective"" so they turned to violence and terrorism as a means to combat it and only ended up alienating people and causing destruction. That said, their history is a worthy topic, though it is more than a little unnerving to see them reminesce about the past without realizing the severity of their actions. The true voice of reason is this film, is Todd Gitlin who although still a strong liberal activist continues to condemn the Weather Underground for what they did. I can't say this film supports what they did but it tends to cast them in a more favorable light than they deserve and to see that some of them are now college professors didn't exactly thrill me. However, as a primer in how the campaign for social justice and equality in the 60's fell apart and divided into factions, this is an excellent film. There is archival footage, the most fascinating of which is a clip from Emile D'Antonio's ""Underground"" which captured the Weather Underground while they were still ""active"" and in hiding in the early 70's and brought the unwelcome attention of the FBI.

810309,A1LF84ED2L4MXB,B0001LYFKO,Doreen Appleton,"[1, 2]","A fine documentary about an extraordinary group of people.The Weather Underground grew out of SDS, and in its early days reflected the inchoate yearning for authenticity, combined with sex and drugs, characteristic of its generation.Then the group became more radical. BRING THE WAR HOME was their slogan. They planned to blow up a military dress ball, killing as many people as possible.But when three of their members were killed in an accidental detonation in New York, they called a time out and reviewed their whole philosophy. They decided that they would never hurt anyone in any of their bombings. And in this they were successful.They bombed public buildings, corporate headquarters, even the Capitol Building in Washington, without hurting anyone. They protested our coup in Chile, the Vietnam War, the murder of George Jackson -- things that were more than deserving of protest.After the Vietnam War ended they splintered, discouraged by their lack of purpose and by inner disunity. In middle age they express regret over their conviction that they had ""the moral high ground,"" they compare themselves to fanatics like Timothy McVeigh and the perpetrators of 9/11. But this regret should concern only their youthful impulse, not their acts. They hurt no one, and they destroyed property in a good cause, the cause of justice.I think the Weather Underground, like the New York Philharmonic, the U.S. Senate, the Supreme Court, should have been an ongoing organization whose members changed over time. By bombing public buildings associated with official cruelty and barbarism, they could have been a constant reminder to our government that its crimes do not go unpunished, and a reminder to Americans that there is still resistance and will always be resistance. We certainly could have used them during George Bush's presidency, when the only sign that Americans saw anything at all wrong with the war in Iraq was Bush's lowered approval rating.In her commentary with husband Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn laments that the U.S. government is still systematically murdering Black resistance leaders, and says in a somewhat throwaway tone, ""We did topple two Presidents."" This is a stark reminder that activism can accomplish great things.One of the group's members, Naomi Jaffe, says eloquently, ""If your government is murdering people and you stay at home and do nothing about it, your very inaction is a kind of violence.""That kind of insight is rare and valuable.",5,A kind of violence,1234137600,"02 9, 2009",2009,2476,"['fine', 'documentary', 'extraordinary', 'group', 'people.The', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'grew', 'SDS', 'early', 'days', 'reflected', 'inchoate', 'yearning', 'authenticity', 'combined', 'sex', 'drugs', 'characteristic', 'generation.Then', 'group', 'became', 'more', 'radical', 'BRING', 'THE', 'WAR', 'HOME', 'was', 'slogan', 'planned', 'blow', 'up', 'military', 'dress', 'ball', 'killing', 'many', 'people', 'possible.But', 'when', 'three', 'members', 'were', 'killed', 'accidental', 'detonation', 'New', 'York', 'called', 'time', 'out', 'reviewed', 'whole', 'philosophy', 'decided', 'would', 'never', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'bombings', 'were', 'successful.They', 'bombed', 'public', 'buildings', 'corporate', 'headquarters', 'even', 'Capitol', 'Building', 'Washington', 'hurting', 'anyone', 'protested', 'coup', 'Chile', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'murder', 'George', 'Jackson', 'things', 'were', 'more', 'deserving', 'protest.After', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'ended', 'splintered', 'discouraged', 'lack', 'purpose', 'inner', 'disunity', 'middle', 'age', 'express', 'regret', 'conviction', 'had', 'moral', 'high', 'ground', 'compare', 'fanatics', 'Timothy', 'McVeigh', 'perpetrators', '9/11', 'regret', 'should', 'concern', 'only', 'youthful', 'impulse', 'not', 'acts', 'hurt', 'one', 'destroyed', 'property', 'good', 'cause', 'cause', 'justice.I', 'think', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'New', 'York', 'Philharmonic', 'U.S.', 'Senate', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'ongoing', 'organization', 'members', 'changed', 'time', 'bombing', 'public', 'buildings', 'associated', 'official', 'cruelty', 'barbarism', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'constant', 'reminder', 'government', 'crimes', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'unpunished', 'reminder', 'Americans', 'still', 'resistance', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'resistance', 'certainly', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'George', 'Bush', 'presidency', 'when', 'only', 'sign', 'Americans', 'saw', 'anything', 'wrong', 'war', 'Iraq', 'was', 'Bush', 'lowered', 'approval', 'rating.In', 'commentary', 'husband', 'Bill', 'Ayers', 'Bernardine', 'Dohrn', 'U.S.', 'government', 'still', 'systematically', 'murdering', 'Black', 'resistance', 'leaders', 'somewhat', 'throwaway', 'tone', 'did', 'topple', 'two', 'Presidents', 'stark', 'reminder', 'activism', 'can', 'accomplish', 'great', 'things.One', 'group', 'members', 'Naomi', 'Jaffe', 'eloquently', 'government', 'murdering', 'people', 'stay', 'home', 'do', 'nothing', 'very', 'inaction', 'kind', 'violence', 'kind', 'insight', 'rare', 'valuable']",The Weather Underground

Did they really think that they were going to be the cadre of a nationwide movement to destroy the capitalist system in the United States? It seems so.One of the biggest flaws, besides their near-total reliance upon violence and the destruction of property, is the simple fact that their whole reason for existing was the Vietnam War. As soon as that war was over, they had no reason to continue.From the beginning, they lacked any real support from outside their group and that should have made them stop and think. The ""Days of Rage"" was just an incident where windows got smashed and little more than that. They weren't revolutionaries. They were vandals. For all the time spent in hiding and for all the sacrifices they made, what did they accomplish?Aside from this documentary and a few other works, there is no lasting legacy of the Weather Underground. One of their members is serving a life sentence, others had served time in prison and been released and some of their members even died in the early years of the group. For what? The United States didn't withdraw from Vietnam because of them specifically, so they couldn't claim the victory that they had suffered for and deprived themselves of creature comforts in its pursuit.I am glad that most of them have gone on with their lives and have even coninued in progressive causes. However, I see nothing that justifies what they did and I feel sad for their lost and wasted youth.This is a good film to see for part of the history of the domestic U.S. opposition to the war in Southeast Asia.

Go post your opinions about 60's/70's radicals, the Vietnam War, Nixon, etc. some place else!Alright.  This is a very focused film on the 60's/70's group The Weather Underground.  It has contemporary interviews w/its members, a few people from The Black Panthers, a former FBI agent, loads of archival footage and some helpful narratives that guide you through events of the period.

The film does not at all glorify them, the directors simply told a story of why these American college students simply wanted to stop the senseless armed conflict in Vietnam and their stance against oppression and racism in America. While I don't agree with their politics i.e., communism, and their unrealistic premise of the majority of Americans would violently revolt against the American government, their commitment ( by death if necessary) to the cause for social change, as told by the director, is very engaging!! I absolutely can't get enough of Weatherman Niomi Jaffee's quote early in the film: "" if you sit in your little white house and go to your little  white job and allow the country you live in to murder people, and you sit there and don't do anything about it that's violence""...if one is not part of the solution they're part of the problem. In the director's commentary, the director said when he interviewed the group said that they didn't want to be ""good Germans"" (in relation to Jaffe's quote)---wow!!I was only five years old when the group went underground, officially,in 1970 after the townhouse explosion (I had my own problems with racism) but I had heard of the name around 1975 and in 1980 when most of charges (the many bombings the group committed)were dropped because of arrogant, stupid, and corrupt tactics of the FBI.Too bad these directors, although nominated, didn't win the academy award for best documentary film---and these directors were not born during that time!!

The documentary is told in retrospect, with former Weathermen looking back at their radical student years, when they felt it was necessary to ""bring the war home,"" which became the anthem of the student movements.  Siegel and Green also show the reaction to the Weathermen at the time.  How they hijacked the SDS and were largely responsible for its demise before taking the movement underground.  They attempted to ally themselves with other radical political groups like the Black Panthers, but the Panthers wanted nothing to do with the Weathermen who they regarded as misguided fools.

810316,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B0001LYFKO,Jeffrey Leach,"[52, 64]","At the end of the 1960's, the various student youth movements took a sharp turn toward the far left. Frustrated by their failures to halt America's involvement in the Vietnam War, a growing minority of student activist leaders whole-heartedly embraced Marxist dogma and began agitating for the overthrow of the United States government. There were a few niggling problems to attend to first, such as taking over the leadership of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), which they accomplished at the 1968 SDS national convention. An interesting thing to remember about extremists regardless of their political leanings is worth mentioning at this point: radicals can't get along with one another. Views and positions take on the rigidity of absolute, immutable truth, and anyone who opposes those views is the enemy--even if they're on your side to begin with. Thus SDS almost immediately disintegrated into squabbling factions of increasing irrelevancy. The most notable group to arise from the ashes of SDS were the Weathermen, an extreme far left organization devoted to bringing about a Marxist revolution in the United States. The name of the group, as you probably know if you're reading this, came from a Bob Dylan song.The Weathermen, later known as the Weather Underground after the members went into hiding, utterly failed to achieve any of their objectives. Their first big action occurred in Chicago when the group launched their own version of Kristalnacht, called ""The Days of Rage."" The Weathermen and their associates roamed through the streets of Chicago, breaking windows, fighting with cops, and generally making a huge nuisance of themselves. Surprisingly, this little action failed to rouse the citizenry from their capitalist coma, a realization that seemed to shock this merry bunch of pranksters. Angered by this failure, the Weathermen decided to take up bomb making as a hobby. What followed were years of targeted bombings against such diverse targets as corporations, government institutions, universities, and other structures serving the ""enemies of the people."" The Weather Underground suffered setbacks, too, like the accidental detonation of a bomb that killed radicals Ted Gold, Diana Oughton, and Terry Robbins in a New York City townhouse on March 6, 1970. Still, the revolution must go on, so over the next several years the bombs continued to explode across the country as the Weather Underground continued to release written or tape recorded ""communiqu&eacute;s"" justifying their violent actions. By the early 1980s most of the members turned themselves into the authorities, exhausted from their years of living in hiding.Why two paragraphs of tedious summary about an irrelevant political group long gone from the American landscape? Because this fascinating documentary, ""The Weather Underground,"" covers most of this material in minute detail through a collection of vintage news reports, documents, film footage, recreations, and interviews. Made a couple of years ago and aired widely on PBS, which is where I saw part of it and wanted more, the documentary revisits many of the principal players more than two decades after the group dissolved. We get to see and hear Billy Ayers, Bernadine Dohrn, Mark Rudd, Naomi Jaffe, David Gilbert, Brian Flanagan, and Laura Whitehorn reminisce about their days as revolutionary fighters battling for the soul of America. Moreover, interviews with former SDS leader Todd Gitlin, former Black Panther Kathleen Cleaver, and FBI agent Don Strickland provide a different point of view on the activities of the Weather Underground. By listening to these people recount their experiences, we learn more about how angry radicals became over the murder of Black Panther leader Fred Hampton, about how the group helped Timothy Leary escape from prison, and learn to marvel in awe at the massive comb over Mark Rudd sported as a young communist revolutionary.It's not too difficult to see where the filmmakers' loyalties lie regarding the activities of the Weather Underground. Although careful not to make them look too cool, it's fairly obvious the presentation aims to present these characters as admirable figures. They placed a baseball bat in Billy Ayers's hands as he strolled down memory lane remembering the ""Days of Rage"" fiasco. While we could write off this stunt as sensationalism, it's more problematic to examine the questions put to the various members. Why did Kathy Boudin's name never come up in the film? Probably because Boudin, unlike many members we see here, did kill people in the name of a revolutionary cause. In the early 1980s, she joined the Black Liberation Army and took part in an armored car robbery that resulted in the deaths of two police officers and a security guard. The ghost of Boudin is apparently a problem the filmmakers wished to avoid, although I should credit them for interviewing David Gilbert, a man currently serving a life sentence for his involvement in the same crime. It just seems most of the questions don't dig too deeply into the questionable practices of the Weather revolution. Then again, maybe they don't need to; several of the former members appear as though they're having problems coming to terms with their past behavior. That's a hopeful sign.Although I've had rough words in the past about these people and their despicable actions, I had a tough time disliking them in the film. A few of them, primarily Mark Rudd and Brian Flanagan, seem like people you could sit down with for a few hours and have an interesting conversation about any topic. The commentary track with Ayers and Dohrn is well worth a listen primarily for the realization that even stolid commies have a self-deprecating sense of humor. But you also discover that several of these people aren't quite ready to repudiate their former positions. I think it was Laura Whitehorn who said she would do it all over again if given the chance, a view that is hardly encouraging. Give this one a watch, though. It's mesmerizing.",5,Mesmerizing,1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,6035,"['end', '1960', 'various', 'student', 'youth', 'movements', 'took', 'sharp', 'turn', 'far', 'left', 'Frustrated', 'failures',

810317,A8T21IR0E5JJI,B0001LYFKO,"Jery Tillotson ""author""","[8, 15]","Little wonder that this otherwise fascinating study of that long-ago radical group called the Weather Underground completely ignores the most notorious member of this white, rich clique: Kathy Boudin. During the filming of this project, Boudin was awaiting a parole hearing for her part in the murders of two beloved cops. The sympathetic film makers didn't want to jeopardize this psychopathic killer's chances of having her parole rejected. It wasn't. She served 22 years and owes her release to a claque of wealthy, white leftist attorneys and old activists. These were the same idiots who protected, sheltered and funded our fun-loving gang of bombers and psychos for more than decade. Other than that, you're treated to the underground as they were back in the 60s/70s and the way they are today. Nothing can hide the bald fact that this small group were composed of white, rich kids who took play acting to an extreme. They were greatly inspired by the youth riots in Europe at the time. The Vietnam War and the black activist movements also fed into the goals of such charismatic young college students as Mark Rudd, Bernardine Dorhn, Bill Ayers, Kathy Boudin and a few others. Bernardine looks good today although she hasn't changed her views very much. What's chilling is that several of these old radicals said they would do the same thing today if they had a chance and the events were propitious. Bill Ayers and Bernardine married and he's now a Distinguished Professor of English at a university. Yet, he suggests he hasn't changed all that much either from his glory days as a bomb thrower. He's shown now with a baseball bat, meandering along those streets where riots once reigned. In his memoirs, ""Fugitive Days,"" he comes across as basically an unsufferable airhead who misses the spotlight and whines about the sad plight of America and the poor blacks. The eeriest part of this movie is the long interview with one of the radicals who was arrested along with Kathy Boudin in the double-murder of the cops. David (?) is in prison for life for his part in this Black Panther planned robbery of a Brinks van. David acts as if he can barely suppress hysterical giggles. HIs mouth struggles to stay serious but occaionally, a looney grin takes over and he remembers intensely all the reasons why he became a ""revolutionary."" That's his name for all the misery he and his fellow terrorists called themselves for a short period in time. My college roommate back in the 60s had an apt name for the Weather Underground: The Marx Brothers of Terrorism. No one knew what they wanted, what their agenda was or why they were blowing up buildings and ""symbols"" across America.

He forgets to add that several of the Weathermen  were blown up while making a bomb in a Greenwich Village townhouse that was to be exploded in a crowded area.

This history is too recent to have been covered in my history classes and too far back for me to have had any personal experience. To fill the hole, I've been watching films.I had not heard of 'The Weathermen' before I came across this film. (I had heard of Bill Ayers, of course, but knew very little about him). I knew that groups like this existed into the seventies from references made to them in other movies ie, the SLA (being the most often referenced and parodied).For me this film was quite informative. Being a Chicago native, I learned about a number of big things that happened right here in my own back yard. However, I couldn't shake the sense that something was missing. The film presented this group as sort of soft core. A lot a harsh talk, but only ""non-violent"" action (non-violent in that they only hurt property, never people). ::I don't think that is what Dr. King had in mind.:: Anyway, for a group that never hurt anyone, they sure had a lot of enemies. The original SDS founder seems super-fumed & hyper-concerned about their association with his group. There is video of a member of the Black Panthers saying effectively - 'These stupid, priveliged, kids are WAY out of control. We don't want anything to do with them.' - Wow!In the movie they do come off as a group of idealistic, over-priveliged white-kids, playing with bombs, but it is repeated ad-nauseum that they didn't hurt people. It sounded untrue based on the things others in the film had to say about them and I have since found some pretty disturbing information about this group, most especially the Bernadette Dohrn comments about the Manson murders.This movie gains three stars for pointing me off into a direction of interesting research, but loses two for obvious bias.",3,I Was Going To Rate This Higher....,1252454400,"09 9, 2009",2009,1856,"['Having', 'been', 'born', 'late', 'seventies', 'missed', 'two', 'whole', 'decades', 'influential', 'history', 'history', 'too', 'recent', 'have', 'been', 'covered', 'history', 'classes', 'too', 'far', 'back', 'have', 'had', 'personal', 'experience', 'fill', 'hole', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'films.I', 'had', 'not', 'heard', ""'The"", 'Weathermen', 'came', 'film', 'had', 'heard', 'Bill', 'Ayers', 'course', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'knew', 'groups', 'existed', 'seventies', 'references', 'made', 'other', 'movies', 'ie', 'SLA', 'being', 'most', 'often', 'referenced', 'parodied', '.For', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'informative', 'Being', 'Chicago', 'native', 'learned', 'number', 'big', 'things', 'happened', 'right', 'here', 'own', 'back', 'yard', 'However', 'could', ""n't"", 'shake', 'sense', 'something', 'was', 'missing', 'film', 'presented', 'group', 'sort', 'soft', 'core', 'lot', 'harsh', 'talk', 'only', 'non-violent', 'action', 'non-violent', 'only', 'hurt', 'property', 'never', 'people', ':I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'what', 'Dr.', 'King', 'had', 'mind', 'Anyway', 'group', 'never', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'sure', 'had', 'lot', 'enemies', 'original', 'SDS', 'founder', 'super-fumed', 'hyper-concerned', 'association', 'group', 'video', 'member', 'Black', 'Panthers', 'saying', 'effectively', ""'These"", 'stupid', 'priveliged', 'kids', 'are', 'WAY', 'control', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'Wow', 'movie', 'do', 'come', 'off', 'group', 'idealistic', 'over-priveliged', 'white-kids', 'playing', 'bombs', 'repeated', 'ad-nauseum', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'people', 'sounded', 'untrue', 'based', 'things', 'others', 'film', 'had', 'say', 'have', 'found', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'information', 'group', 'most', 'especially', 'Bernadette', 'Dohrn', 'comments', 'Manson', 'murders.This', 'movie', 'gains', 'three', 'stars', 'pointing', 'off', 'direction', 'interesting', 'research', 'two', 'obvious', 'bias']",The Weather Underground

810323,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0001LYFKO,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[0, 3]","In the 1960s the Vietnam War began for the Americans to which Daniel Ellsworth once quote in the documentary Hearts and Minds (1974), ""We weren't on the wrong side -- we were the wrong side.""  Simultaneously with the Vietnam War civil injustice was common in the United States where people were struggling for equal rights for African-Americans in the United States.  This in the backdrop nuclear war threat instigated by a government that was dealing with real threats such as the Cuba Crisis.  The assassinations of Martin Luther King, the Kennedy's, Malcom X, Fred Hampton, and others seemed to have left a deep psychological scar in many young Americans as they decided to stand up and voice their opinion against the violence and exploitation in the world.  One of these organizations were Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), which organized rallies against the war in Vietnam and social injustice in the society, as they promoted peace and democracy.SDS was run by college students that wanted to make a change in the society for the better, and within the the organization a number of members had more radical ideas of how this would be accomplished.  These members where a part of the internal group, Weather Underground, a name they acquired  from Bob Dylan's song Subterranean Homesick Blues where on line goes as this -- ""You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows.""  The Weather Underground seized the power of the SDS in 1969 at the national convention in Chicago.  The founder of SDS, Todd Gitlin, described it as, ""Institutional piracy.""The radical notions that were brought to the table by the Weather Underground was based on the little progress they have observed.  Thus, the Weather Underground decided to take actions into their own hands as they began to organize for a revolution, which they believed was needed to bring about a change.  Much of the Weather Underground's activities were considered terrorism, as they promoted active violence against the government.  However, after an incident where an innocent person was killed the group sat down and discussed the philosophy of the Weather Underground.  The conclusion was that no more lives was to be taken, and that extra precautions was to be taken in order the death of people.Throughout the 1970s the Weather Underground committed several bombings in regards to acts they considered criminal and unjust.  They had to cut their ties with their families in order to avoid arrest by the FBI.  The FBI did everything possible in order to seek and destroy this organization, but without any luck.  When the Vietnam War ended in 1975 the Weather Underground fell into the shadows of history, and as the members grew older and began to build families a life on the run became difficult.  This led to most of the members turning themselves into the authorities, and what is interesting is that most members of the Weather Underground were released as the FBI had broken several laws in their attempts to arrest them.Through the many interviews in the film the audience can learn that the former members of the Weather Underground are still passionate about their political views.  They believed what they did was for a just cause in a time of great difficulty and they do not regret their accomplishments.  However, in retrospect they wish they could have made some things a differently as wisdom have caught up with them.",4,Violent Approach to Social Change by Radical Political Youth,1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,3419,"['1960s', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'began', 'Americans', 'Daniel', 'Ellsworth', 'once', 'quote', 'documentary', 'Hearts', 'Minds', '1974', 'were', ""n't"", 'wrong', 'side', 'were', 'wrong', 'side', 'Simultaneously', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'civil', 'injustice', 'was', 'common', 'United', 'States', 'where', 'people', 'were', 'struggling', 'equal', 'rights', 'African-Americans', 'United', 'States', 'backdrop', 'nuclear', 'war', 'threat', 'instigated', 'government', 'was', 'dealing', 'real', 'threats', 'such', 'Cuba', 'Crisis', 'assassinations', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Kennedy', 'Malcom', 'X', 'Fred', 'Hampton', 'others', 'seemed', 'have', 'left', 'deep', 'psychological', 'scar', 'many', 'young', 'Americans', 'decided', 'stand', 'up', 'voice', 'opinion', 'violence', 'exploitation', 'world', 'One', 'organizations', 'were', 'Students', 'Democratic', 'Society', 'SDS', 'organized', 'rallies', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'social', 'injustice', 'society', 'promoted', 'peace', 'democracy.SDS', 'was', 'run', 'college', 'students', 'wanted', 'make', 'change', 'society', 'better', 'organization', 'number', 'members', 'had', 'more', 'radical', 'ideas', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'accomplished', 'members', 'where', 'part', 'internal', 'group', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'name', 'acquired', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'song', 'Subterranean', 'Homesick', 'Blues', 'where', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'weather', 'man', 'know', 'way', 'wind', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'seized', 'power', 'SDS', '1969', 'national', 'convention', 'Chicago', 'founder', 'SDS', 'Todd', 'Gitlin', 'described', 'Institutional', 'piracy', 'radical', 'notions', 'were', 'brought', 'table', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'was', 'based', 'little', 'progress', 'have', 'observed', 'Thus', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'decided', 'take', 'actions', 'own', 'hands', 'began', 'organize', 'revolution', 'believed', 'was', 'needed', 'bring', 'about', 'change', 'Much', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'activities', 'were', 'considered', 'terrorism', 'promoted', 'active', 'violence', 'government', 'However', 'incident', 'where', 'innocent', 'person', 'was', 'killed', 'group', 'sat', 'down', 'discussed', 'philosophy', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'conclusion', 'was', 'more', 'lives', 'was', 'be', 'taken', 'extra', 'precautions', 'was', 'be', 'taken', 'order', 'death', '1970s', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'committed', 'several', 'bombings', 'regards', 'acts', 'considered', 'criminal', 'unjust', 'had', 'cut', 'ties', 'families', 'order', 'avoid', 'arrest', 'FBI', 'FBI', 'did', 'everything', 'possible', 'order', 'seek', 'destroy', 'organization', 'luck', 'When', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'ended', '1975', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'fell', 'shadows', 'history', 'members', 'grew', 'older', 'began', 'build', 'families', 'life', 'run', 'became', 'difficult', 'led', 'most', 'members', 'turning', 'authorities', 'what', 'interesting', 'most', 'members', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'were', 'released', 'FBI', 'had', 'broken', 'several', 'laws', 'attempts', 'arrest', 'many', 'interviews', 'film', 'audience', 'can', 'learn', 'former', 'members', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'are', 'still', 'passionate', 'political', 'views', 'believed', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'just', 'cause', 'time', 'great', 'difficulty', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'accomplishments', 'However', 'retrospect', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'things', 'differently', 'wisdom', 'have', 'caught', 'up']",The Weather Underground

810325,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B0001LYFKO,Lleu Christopher,"[47, 52]","In some ways, the group known as the Weather Underground (originally the Weathermen, an offshoot of Students for a Democratic Society) were more a symbol of 1960s radical idealism than a real revolutionary movement. Although they planted many bombs during a decade-long period, they never did anything that seriously threatened the government or power structure. Their goal, of course, was to spark a mass movement and inspire others to follow their example, but they remained essentially marginalized. The film, The Weather Underground does a good job at letting members of this group explain their motives and, in some cases, misgivings about their foray into revolution. Directors Bill Siegel and Sam Green seem to be sympathetic with the movement, and most of the material is told from the point of view of members. Leaders of the group Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers have retained their radical views and are anything but apologetic about their past actions.Most members of the group, despite the bombings, were committed to not harming people. This brings up a rather blatant omission in the film -Kathy Boudin, perhaps the group's most notorious member (for her participation in a robbery where a man was killed) is not mentioned at all. This was an unfortunate decision, apparently done to portray the Weathermen as essentially nonviolent. To leave out such a well known chapter in the group's history leaves a gaping hole. Still, the parts that are included are fascinating and give a glimpse into the idealism and naivete of these leftist radicals.In retrospect, it is (at least from one perspective) a little sad to see how little long term effect the 1960s counterculture had on society. It seems that they were no match for the propaganda machine of the government and mass media. This film, of course, employs propaganda methods of its own, as when brutal footage from the Vietnam war is shown. Propaganda it may be, but it does serve to almost trivialize the violence committed by the Weathermen compared with that perpetrated by the government it was opposing. The other side to this argument is that the fact that these radicals are still alive and that a film like this has been allowed to be made is proof that America is not as oppressive as some would have us believe.

After decades of protest, the student left came to realize that their words were less than meaningless: the Nixon-led government did whatever it wished, from the My Lai massacre to Kent State to Watergate, and the people were powerless.  Faced with this dilemma, the left had a choice: continue the useless verbiage, or &quot;bring the war home?&quot;The answer to this question is not an easy one.  This film doesn't take sides, and shows the conflicting feelings of the Weathermen today.  Of course, most people are fully indoctrinated into the U.S. ideological state apparatus and would be outraged by the suggestion that the people should exercise violent power.  They would justify the outrageous tactics of Cointelpro in the name of Order, much like the fat, repulsive FBI narc does in this film.Undoubtedly, when your government commits atrocities across the globe, the safest course of action is to be a timid, bleating sheep.  The Weathermen sought to awaken the sheep, but underestimated the apathy and docility of the American public.  At any rate, acts of terrorism only drive the sheep away in a stampede, not towards you.  The Weathermen probably helped the troglodytic Nixon, much like al-Qaeda has greatly helped Dubya.I, for one, wish I lived in a generation that had its own revolution.&quot;Our leaders are low-rent Fascists and our laws are a tangle of mockeries.

Tony Alamo never went back to jewish,and went on to become an evangelical minister.I always thought the 'Weathermen' and the 'Weather Underground' got their name from Uncle Joe Stalin.During Stalin's early days,he worked with a group of scientific meteorologists,at a weather observatory.And they surely talked about political beliefs and their disdane of the oppressive Tsar.This documentary ended on a sour note for communists and leftists alike.I wonder if communism is realy dead.China now has the largest economy in the world.South America is moving forward with refined socialism.Once the right-wing dictators were moved along,their Latin American economies began to improve,under left-wing socialist policies.North Korea and Cuba ,controlled by internal blood kinship,has remained stagnet and fruitless.It appears the red radikals of the '60s went on to become 'Christian Socialists'.Many Jewish yippies appear to have suffered by leaving their rabbinical family values.Abbie Hoffmann overdosed and Jerry Rubin sold out to commerce.Ira Einhorn did not become a 'Soldier of Christ' and was later charged in the senseless death of his girl-friend ,Holly Maddox.Holly was a young Southern girl,from a conservative family.She was like a lost sheep,in search of a meaningful bell-wether.The zeitgeist of the times,mislead her towards the hippie pied-piper,Ira Einhorn.As Leftism began to ebb out,and the ethos began to change,the couple differed and splittered.This documentary shows that not all the sixties marriages ended in complete failure.Bill Ayers is still married to Bernadine Dohrn.The photos ,throughout the documentary,are amazing.The graffic photos of Jay Sebring and Sharon Tate are shocking.Several interesting footage shots of the various demostrations and police-battles,yesterday and today.A segment of film has even the defrocked academic and the High Pope of Dope,Timothy Leary.Which shows that there were so many varied causes and very different people ,working together,to promote change.To show that the 'norm' was abnormal and make the staus-quo into the 'status of what should be' for all.",5,The Stormy Times of the Weathermen( and

I don't have a problem with such a documentary featuring many interviews with former members of the group.  What I do mind is that the documentary pretty much consists of these individuals making statements that the documentary makers don't bother to challenge.  Also, the documentary makers don't give any biographical information about these former ""urban guerrillas"" lives which might give some context and understanding about why they embraced violence.I also didn't see any dialogue between the documentary makers and their subjects where they got asked hard questions.  I would have liked to have seen them put on the spot about all the murderous communist regimes they idolized (like Mao's China ... then in the grip of the Cultural Revolution or the North Vietnamese, or the Soviets).I guess I just question the overall way this project took place.  Like I said above, the Weather Underground was certainly a worthwhile subject for a documentary.  But I can't help but think that the film that resulted from this effort reveals a bit of bias to the violent left that some of our nation's elites have.  After all, it's not like this is a companion piece to a similar project about the Ku Klux Klan (which would feature members talking with nostalgia about the days where they ""fought for the South"").",2,Gives the Microphone to Mostly Unrepentant Former Terrorists,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,1387,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'doing', 'documentary', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'many', 'interviews', 'former', 'members', 'group', 'What', 'do', 'mind', 'documentary', 'pretty', 'much', 'consists', 'individuals', 'making', 'statements', 'documentary', 'makers', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'challenge', 'Also', 'documentary', 'makers', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'biographical', 'information', 'former', 'urban', 'guerrillas', 'lives', 'might', 'give', 'context', 'understanding', 'about', 'why', 'embraced', 'violence.I', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'dialogue', 'documentary', 'makers', 'subjects', 'where', 'got', 'asked', 'hard', 'questions', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'put', 'spot', 'murderous', 'communist', 'regimes', 'idolized', 'Mao', 'China', 'then', 'grip', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'Soviets', '.I', 'guess', 'just', 'question', 'overall', 'way', 'project', 'took', 'place', 'said', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'was', 'certainly', 'worthwhile', 'subject', 'documentary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'film', 'resulted', 'effort', 'bit', 'bias', 'violent', 'left', 'nation', 'elites', 'have', 'not', 'companion', 'piece', 'similar', 'project', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'would', 'feature', 'members', 'talking', 'nostalgia', 'days', 'where', 'fought', 'South']",The Weather Underground

I completely agree, but I think that the strongest point of this documentary is the way in which it highlights the reasons why an student living in that period might have felt attracted to the kind of distorted political activism that ""The Weather Underground"" proposed.In that sense, this film includes not only footage from that epoch, providing a good historical context, but also more recent  interviews with former members of this movement, that give their retrospective opinions on what happened. A few would do exactly the same thing again, while others regret their deeds, saying that their intentions were good but their means weren t.

It is a common human weakness to wish to make more of our contribution to the world than the world is prepared to acknowledge, and it is our fantasy world that allows us to fill this gap.

Indeed, a common criterion of our mental health is the extent to which we are able to keep our fantasies firmly under our watchful control . . .

810336,AK61LQI92GTCH,B0001LYFKO,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[8, 9]","Something of a `Where are they now?' documentary profiling members of the radical group the Weather Underground three decades on.  A splinter group of the SDS (Students for a Democratic Society,) the Weatherman, as one interviewee notes, `stole' the student left from SDS at an acrimonious convention held in the late 1960s. Affirming an affinity with liberation movements across the globe - revolution was `in' back then, - identifying strongly with the Black Panthers, and in violent opposition to the Vietnam War, the Weathermen preached active resistance against America's `white imperialist' actions at home and abroad.Although director Bill Siegel must have sympathized with the subject, the graying radicals, neither the film nor his commentary track betrays an overbearing bias.  The film moves, sometimes confusingly, from the SDS convention to the Days of Rage in Chicago in 1969, the Weathermen's first public protest that degenerated into a bat-wielding riot.  Then it's on to a townhouse bombing where three Weathermen were killed when a bomb they were building to use at a military dance exploded prematurely.  More bombing followed the townhouse bombing, although the ex-members, who went underground at that point, stress often that the bombings were symbolic actions only.  No one was killed, they claim, and targets were carefully chosen.  Police stations when a Black Panther was killed, State Department buildings in response to atrocities in Vietnam. Siegel strings together archive film, old newscasts, and the like to tell the story.  Interspersed are talking-head interviews with surviving Weather Underground members.  Visually it's all a little static.  I've watched this film three times in the last week or so.  There are two commentary tracks, one with director Siegel, the other with original Weather Underground members Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers. I don't think it could have been cut much better, but with so many talking heads and footage shot from the inside of a moving car at an anonymous landscape, well, the eye starts to starve a bit.THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND confronts us with an issue that is still with us and probably always will be.  What are your responsibilities when confronted with what you believe is injustice? Is, as one ex-member asks at one point in the movie, doing nothing in the face of violence an act of violence itself? The brilliant thing about this movie is that it is open to many valid responses - you can view the Weathermen as committed idealists willing to risk their lives for social justice, or young, white children of privilege intoxicated with their own sense of moral righteousness and willing to bomb themselves, along with the whole anti-war movement, to the margins with their outrageous behavior. Some documentaries invite you to stroll down Memory Lane.  THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND marches you through a nightmare battleground.

810337,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B0001LYFKO,stoic,"[6, 6]","The documentary Weather Underground is a fascinating look at the 1960s group that attempted to ""bring the [Vietnam] War home"" by committing bombings and other violent acts in the U.S. It is difficult to fathom why the WU genuinely believed it could overthrow the U.S. Government and replace it with a communist utopia. The film is thought provoking, but the filmmakers, unfortunately, chose not to discuss some of the worst behaviors of the WU's members.The best part of WU, for me, was not the film's account of the WU's history; I've read several books on the group, so the history was already familiar.What I found fascinating were the contemporary views of the former WU members. The former members have widely-differing views on whether the WU actions were justified. Some members defend the group's idealism, others concede that the WU violence was wrong. I think that it is fair to say that each former WU member still has some degree of angst about the group; none of the interviewees seems to be completely ""at peace"" with his or her participation in the group.My main criticism of the film is that, while encouraging the viewer to think about SDS' actions, it does not mention many of the WU's most-shameful moments. For instance, the filmmakers fail to mention that:a) Bernardine Dohrn lavishly praised Charles Manson and his followers for murdering ""pigs"" such as Sharon Tate. (Specifically, she said ""Dig it. First they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room with them, they even shoved a fork into a victim's stomach! Wild!"").b) Richard Elrod, an aide to Chicago's Mayor Richard J. Daley, was paralyzed by the injuries the WU's members inflicted on him during the WU's Days of Rage in Chicago in 1969. After Elrod's injury, the WU publication New Left Notes stated ""Elrod is now paralyzed--hopefully for life. He won't be so quick to play pig next time.""c) Several WU ""alumni"" committed two murders during a 1981 armored-car robbery in New York. It is particularly bizarre that the filmmakers do not mention the case because they interviewed ex- WU member David Gilbert in prison for their film; the film tells the viewer that Gilbert is in prison, but never says why.To be fair, the film does include several comments from Todd Gitlin (a former President of SDS, the group that spawned the WU) on the arrogance and ignorance of many WU members.I still think that this film is well worth watching, providing viewers keep in mind that (as always) they are hearing and seeing only certain facets of the story. My wife and I watched the film together and we both found that the film caused us to think about the issues it raised long after we finished watching it.

810338,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B0001LYFKO,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[4, 6]","I was a relatively young part of the era to which this excellent documentary refers. I never got into the violent dimension of it--but nor do I claim to be a ""pacifist."" So there's lots to reflect on...The Students for a Democratic Society was, as people from that era remember, a ""radical"" group during an era in which the United States was exterminating Vietnamese peasants while subjugating black activists at home. A faction of the SDS, the Weather Underground, unhappy with the glacial rate of change, in essence took over the organization and fostered violence.The FBI kept tabs on them--for reasons not without some justification. Some of their leaders were constructing a bomb to be used at an officers club when a short circuit detonated the bomb. Those working on it were killed. Then the FBI knew they had a target.Todd Gitlin, who'd been the president of the more ""moderate"" SDS, comments repeatedly throughout the film. Needless to say, he disapproved of the direction the Weather Underground was taking them. He argues that when they plot to bomb essentially innocent people, they become like, say, Hitler or Stalin. It becomes a ""religious"" cause that needs little more justification. (Yeah, there was the youth-culture dimension of it too, the rejection of monogamy, the ""free sex,"" much of which was pretty naive.)After the self-destruction of some of the Weathermen, the remaining faction decided that the bombing wasn't inappropriate, just the killing of the innocent was. So they bombed various institutions over the next few years to make their point--while making sure no one would be needlessly hurt. In the meantime, eloquent Black Panther leader Fred Hampton was murdered by the authorities, and the Weather Underground endeared that cause.I should add what the film does: that later in ""the era,"" there were activities that made the movement look bad, e.g., that Manson family and Altamont. I'm glad the producers didn't lose track of those tidbits on many of which we (mistakenly) reflect more than we do on the positive results of the era.The Weather Underground members went truly underground to come out many years later.All in all, this was a superb documentary. As one can imagine, those who were active in the movement then have ""mixed feelings"" about them now described best, perhaps, by Mark Rudd. Did they make mistakes? Of course they did. Do they proclaim that ""all we did was wrong""? No! That's among the dimensions of their movement that I appreciate.It's important to recognize how wrong the US foreign policy was in that era (something for which we'll be paying for decades if not centuries.) So something doubtless needed to be done.I note too that, aside from one character, still in prison in NY for an event in which some were killed after his Weather affiliation, they are all employed in causes of many kinds, i.e., they didn't all become insurance company executives, which is the stereotype on which those who decry the 60s movements rely. And another very important dimension the film covers is that most of the Weather Underground were NOT prosecuted and jailed despite some of their activities. It seems the FBI had broken so many laws in tailing the activists that the bureau couldn't pursue a case against them! (There was coverage too of the group in Media, PA who broke into the FBI office there and exposed to the media the questionable and clearly illegal activities of the FBI. It should make one reflect on the surveillance that is being rationalized today ostensibly based on ""terror"" threats!)I recommend this for students today--many of whom are more sold on the Super Bowl than on Iraq--for people who want to recollect an era and its causes without all the fluff the pop media attach to it. There's always something to learn and this film offers a few dimensions of that learning and, again, much on which to reflect.",5,Important that we remember,1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,3883,"['was', 'relatively', 'young', 'part', 'era', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'refers', 'never', 'got', 'violent', 'dimension', 'do', 'claim', 'be', 'pacifist', 'lots', 'reflect', 'Students', 'Democratic', 'Society', 'was', 'people', 'era', 'remember', 'radical', 'group', 'era', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'exterminating', 'Vietnamese', 'peasants', 'subjugating', 'black', 'activists', 'home', 'faction', 'SDS', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'unhappy', 'glacial', 'rate', 'change', 'essence', 'took', 'over', 'organization', 'fostered', 'violence.The', 'FBI', 'kept', 'tabs', 'reasons', 'not', 'justification', 'leaders', 'were', 'constructing', 'bomb', 'be', 'used', 'officers', 'club', 'when', 'short', 'circuit', 'detonated', 'bomb', 'working', 'were', 'killed', 'Then', 'FBI', 'knew', 'had', 'target.Todd', 'Gitlin', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'president', 'more', 'moderate', 'SDS', 'comments', 'repeatedly', 'film', 'Needless', 'say', 'disapproved', 'direction', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'was', 'taking', 'when', 'plot', 'bomb', 'essentially', 'innocent', 'people', 'become', 'say', 'Hitler', 'Stalin', 'religious', 'cause', 'little', 'more', 'justification', 'Yeah', 'was', 'youth-culture', 'dimension', 'too', 'rejection', 'monogamy', 'free', 'sex', 'much', 'was', 'pretty', 'naive', 'self-destruction', 'Weathermen', 'remaining', 'faction', 'decided', 'bombing', 'was', ""n't"", 'inappropriate', 'just', 'killing', 'innocent', 'was', 'bombed', 'various', 'institutions', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'make', 'point', 'making', 'sure', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'needlessly', 'hurt', 'meantime', 'eloquent', 'Black', 'Panther', 'leader', 'Fred', 'Hampton', 'was', 'murdered', 'authorities', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'endeared', 'cause.I', 'should', 'add', 'what', 'film', 'later', 'era', 'were', 'activities', 'made', 'movement', 'look', 'bad', 'e.g.', 'Manson', 'family', 'Altamont', ""'m"", 'glad', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'lose', 'track', 'tidbits', 'many', 'mistakenly', 'reflect', 'more', 'do', 'positive', 'results', 'era.The', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'members', 'went', 'truly', 'underground', 'come', 'out', 'many', 'years', 'later.All', 'was', 'superb', 'documentary', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'who', 'were', 'active', 'movement', 'then', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'now', 'best', 'perhaps', 'Mark', 'Rudd', 'Did', 'make', 'mistakes', 'course', 'did', 'Do', 'proclaim', 'did', 'was', 'wrong', 'No', 'dimensions', 'movement', 'appreciate.It', 'important', 'recognize', 'how', 'wrong', 'US', 'foreign', 'policy', 'was', 'era', 'something', ""'ll"", 'be', 'paying', 'decades', 'not', 'centuries', 'something', 'doubtless', 'needed', 'be', 'done.I', 'note', 'too', 'that', 'aside', 'one', 'character', 'still', 'prison', 'NY', 'event', 'were', 'killed', 'Weather', 'affiliation', 'are', 'employed', 'causes', 'many', 'kinds', 'i.e.', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'insurance', 'company', 'executives', 'stereotype', 'who', 'decry', '60s', 'movements', 'rely', 'very', 'important', 'dimension', 'film', 'most', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'were', 'NOT', 'prosecuted', 'jailed', 'activities', 'FBI', 'had', 'broken', 'so', 'many', 'laws', 'tailing', 'activists', 'bureau', 'could', ""n't"", 'pursue', 'case', 'was', 'coverage', 'too', 'group', 'Media', 'PA', 'who', 'broke', 'FBI', 'office', 'there', 'exposed', 'media', 'questionable', 'clearly', 'illegal', 'activities', 'FBI', 'should', 'make', 'one', 'reflect', 'surveillance', 'being', 'rationalized', 'today', 'ostensibly', 'based', 'terror', 'threats', 'recommend', 'students', 'today', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'more', 'sold', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'Iraq', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'recollect', 'era', 'causes', 'fluff', 'pop', 'media', 'attach', 'always', 'something', 'learn', 'film', 'few', 'dimensions', 'learning', 'again', 'much', 'reflect']",The Weather Underground
