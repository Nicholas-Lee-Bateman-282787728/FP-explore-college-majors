Because the movie serves as a list of actual information to men about what to do, or not to do if they want to have a good chance with women, or increase their percentage of success at least.  As always, Will Smith is charming to no end and only helps men who really like women.  This film has gotten some great reviews from friends of mine who think it's a very good film and while I understand why they feel that way (it's one of the best that have come out in awhile and it doesn't feel tired, or like a retread) but I still find the conventions of this genre annoying.  As much as I enjoyed the relationship between Alex Hitchens and whatever her name was, I couldn't help but know that the writers had to throw a contrived obstacle in the way when it isn't really necessary.  For instance, Will Smith's character, Hitch, helps men who trip over themselves get their foot in the door with women and that's all, he's not a relationship counselor, he's a date doctor and I think the movie unfairly tags al",3,It's a good romantic comedy and not a chick flick,1124150400,"08 16, 2005",2005,1022,"['Why', 'say', 'movie', 'list', 'actual', 'information', 'men', 'what', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'want', 'have', 'good', 'chance', 'women', 'increase', 'percentage', 'success', 'least', 'always', 'Will', 'Smith', 'charming', 'end', 'only', 'men', 'who', 'really', 'like', 'women', 'film', 'gotten', 'great', 'reviews', 'friends', 'mine', 'who', 'think', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'understand', 'why', 'feel', 'way', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'awhile', ""n't"", 'feel', 'tired', 'retread', 'still', 'find', 'conventions', 'genre', 'annoying', 'As', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'relationship', 'Alex', 'Hitchens', 'name', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'know', 'writers', 'had', 'throw', 'contrived', 'obstacle', 'way', 'when', ""n't"", 'really', 'necessary', 'instance', 'Will', 'Smith', 'character', 'Hitch', 'men', 'who', 'trip', 'get', 'foot', 'door', 'women', 'not', 'relationship', 'counselor', 'date', 'doctor', 'think', 'movie', 'unfairly', 'al']",N/A

This review is about the transfer to HD.Sometimes the picture looks great and are obviously HD, but other times it's just plain ugly and DVD quality or less.This is very obvious (i'm not a videophile, just an ordinary guy with money to blow on blu-ray) because the quality changes many times during a single scene, changing based on the camera angle.So you end up with a shot of will smith that looks awesome, and then suddenly there's a shot of someone else that looks terrible, then it's back to will smith and looking good, then the camera changes back to the horrible looking image.It's still better than the DVD, but it's not what it could or should be.It's a shame that the movie is not up to par because the early adopters of this technology are the least price sensitive, but the most likely to notice poor quality.Go ahead and charge a fortune for the movies, but at least make them the best possible. Sadly, the high price combined with the poor HD transfer make the offerings unattractive to both the early adopters as well as more general consumers.There's a decent chance a Sony exec of some kind will read this, and if so, I hope you have the cajones to do what it takes to make your media platform a success.

901725,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000957O7S,Alex Udvary,"[1, 3]","On the surface the message of ""Hitch"" is you can't predict love. There are no rules, you just have to go out there and be yourself and if you do that you will find everyone has a special someone out there waiting to be found.But I've seen this movie before and the most memorable example is the 1972 Herbert Ross film based on Woody Allen's stage play ""Play It Again, Sam"". In that movie Allen wants to be Humphrey Bogart, who is suppose to be the epitome of cool. Allen thinks if he can act more like somone else, and less like himself he will get the girl.Fastforward, it's now 2005 and most people don't know who Humphrey Bogart is so they now look to Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens (Will Smith) who is a ""date doctor"". He coaches men on how to be cool. He tells them all the rules of dating.I wonder though if underneath the surface there is another message being sent out. Will Smith is an African-American actor who has a great amount of box-office success. Maybe he wasn't chosen for the part merely because of his appeal. In our society we tend to think the black culture is also the epitome of cool. Only black men can act suave and sweep the ladies off their feet. Only they know how to dress or dance whereas white men are seen as nerds. Notice how nearly all of Hitch's clients are white males. I realize I'm thinking outside the box here, but don't be so quick to dismiss the casting decisions made in this movie. I realize Hollywood at times seems as if it doesn't have a brain but just think about it the images you are seeing and what exactly they mean in relation to society.But most people who watch this movie may not even think about it terms of its social ramification so lets talk about it as if it had no hidden agenda.Alex Hitchens was not always the ""date doctor"" as a flashback shows us. In college he was quite unpopular until one day he fell in love with Cressida (Robinne Lee). He thought she was the love of his life and he made sure to repeatedly tell her he loves her to which she would appear uncomfortable. Alex then catches Cressida cheating on him, breaking his heart. He now vows he will never have another man go through what he did again. So he decides he will help men get the women of their dreams.Albert (Kevin James) is an accountant who is in love with Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), one of the clients his firm handles. She doesn't even know he exist and so he seeks out Hitch.Hitch thinks Albert his hopeless but sticking true to his vow agrees to help him out anyway. Albert though does nothing but stumble over things and knock things over. But I just found it annoying. Sure Woody Allen has made a career out of it, but I've never heard, even from Allen's critics, somone describe what he does as predictable and juvenile. I can not say the same thing for Kevin James.Now while Hitch is helping Albert get the girl of his dreams, Hitch meets a gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes). Sara is shown as a cold bitter person who has some issues, that sadly are never fully explored in this movie, and seems to have sworn off men. She claims they always disappoint her. We soon realize she was just waiting for Hitch to come along. But when Hitch is with her he doesn't seem to be playing his game right. He stumbles, says the wrong thing, and even gets food poisoning.The movie then becomes a guessing game of whether or not Albert will get Allegra in the end? Will Allegra find out about Hitch? Will Hitch get Sara and will she ever find out about who he really is?If you're over five who should be able to guess the answers to these questions and that's pretty much the problem with this movie. Everythng happens exactly the way it is suppose to happens. Nothing new or different is done here. It strickly follows the formula of movies before it. And I thought it was all done without any big laughs.Now a movie like ""Hitch"" I guess is pretty hard to actually hate it. I didn't have a bad physical reaction to it but I don't think I would want to watch it again. It is not a great movie and quite frankly I'm surprised at the reaction this movie is getting on Amazon. But this movie is not worth your time.Okay, so if by some small miricle I've convinced you not to see this movie you're asking yourself then what should I go out and see. Well in theaters there is Paul Haggis' ""Crash"", and if you like animation, and even if you don't, please, please, please go see ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and I also recommend ""Cinderella Man"" and the new ""Star Wars"" movie. On DVD you have Sean Penn giving one of his best performances in ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" and Kevin Bacon in ""The Woodsman"" and on a lighter note the Alain Renais French musical\comedy ""Not on the Lips"".Bottom-line: Disappointing formula driven romantic\comedy that just isn't all that funny. Kevin James starts to get a bit annoying and the movie just bails on Eva Mendes as it leads us to think there is some secret about her past and a particular man that may have hurt her.",2,"Don't Run

901726,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000957O7S,Alistair McHarg,"[5, 20]","Get out! Stop! I mean it! This is so funny! His name is Alex Hitchens, they call him Hitch, and he helps people get hitched. Stop it! That is too clever! (Yikes).The best thing you can say about this formulaic twaddle is that it's inoffensive, which is precisely what makes it so awful. Hitch has UCLA film school screenplay written all over it, especially the knucklehead antics ensuing as doctor and client wrestle in parallel. Then comes the wildly unsurprising payout - Albert is really much more wise in the ways of love than Alex. Who saw that bombshell coming?What little joy there is to be milked from this ancient cow comes through the grace of lovely Allegra, Amber Valletta, and Albert, Kevin James. The character of Allegra is a preposterous concoction, but Ms. Valletta gives it authenticity, quite an achievement. As to Kevin James, this is one fine comic actor who seems completely natural and comfortable on camera. He is both gifted and skilled with a marvelous way of achieving the virtually impossible task of making comedy look easy. As far as Will Smith goes, well, it's not far enough.I wouldn't say Smith is incapable of acting, because I have seen him turn in credible performances. But, I would say that no one has cruised quite so effortlessly down the freeway for so long with so little gas in the tank. Frankly, Smith is likeable and non-threatening, his appeal rests in his good looks and the absolute certainty that he will never do or say anything remotely interesting or controversial.Let's not downplay the value provided here. In a tormented world, some folks want to take a date to the movies secure in the knowledge that every emotion they're about to experience has been reviewed and approved by the FDA.

This all boils down to one huge disaster stew and it's absolutely hilarious.Will Smith is always a joy to watch, but it's really Kevin James that makes this movie.

901735,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000957O7S,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","While `Hitch' may not be the most original romantic comedy to hit the big screen it's one of the most enjoyable.  Will Smith is always entertaining and effortlessly captivating, but this time, with the pairing of the breathtaking beauty known as Eva Mendes and the hilarious Kevin James, Smith is brought to the top of his game.  The script is sweet and refreshing, the dialog is smart and funny and the acting is top notch.  Eva Mendes is not only beautiful but charming and funny.  She keeps proving with each role no matter how thankless that she is more than a pretty face.  This role is not thankless, thankfully, but just the same she's a star.  The real standout though is Kevin James who outdoes himself.  I've always loved James' standup and his show `The King of Queens' but here he really blows me away with his natural charm and humor.Smith plays Alex `Hitch' Hitchens, a date doctor as it were, who helps coach men into successful relationships.  His latest project is Albert, an overweight accountant who has fallen for the rich and beautiful Allegra Cole, a woman many may consider out of his league.  With Hitch's help Albert begins to woo Allegra and a mutual attraction between the two is formed.  In the meantime Hitch himself finds he's been struck by cupids arrow, falling for columnist Sara Meles, and soon we discover that Hitch is about as helpless as the men he coaches.  Between the two couples hilarity ensues and the audience is never left bored or wanting.As may well be expected events line themselves up to expose Hitch and his clientele and threaten to end both sets of blossoming relationships.  All is good though and the ride is a fun and entertaining one.  The chemistry between the entire cast is fantastic.  James feeds Albert enough charm and tenderheartedness that the audience falls in love with him alongside Allegra and Mendes plays Sara with enough sass and smarts that we can easily understand why Hitch is so absorbed in her.  Smith may be the star but with a cast this impressive he gladly shares the spotlight and the praise with his co-stars.  It's fun and breezy entertainment suitable for the entire family and will go down as one of my favorite romantic comedies of late.",5,"Funny, refreshing and oh so much fun, exactly what I've been waiting for...",1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,2223,"['Hitch', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'original', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'Will', 'Smith', 'always', 'entertaining', 'effortlessly', 'captivating', 'time', 'pairing', 'breathtaking', 'beauty', 'known', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'hilarious', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Smith', 'brought', 'top', 'game', 'script', 'sweet', 'refreshing', 'dialog', 'smart', 'funny', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'not', 'only', 'beautiful', 'charming', 'funny', 'proving', 'role', 'no', 'matter', 'how', 'thankless', 'more', 'pretty', 'face', 'role', 'not', 'thankless', 'thankfully', 'just', 'same', 'star', 'real', 'standout', 'though', 'Kevin', 'James', 'who', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'James', 'standup', 'show', 'King', 'Queens', 'here', 'really', 'away', 'natural', 'charm', 'humor.Smith', 'plays', 'Alex', 'Hitch', 'Hitchens', 'date', 'doctor', 'were', 'who', 'coach', 'men', 'successful', 'relationships', 'latest', 'project', 'Albert', 'overweight', 'accountant', 'who', 'fallen', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'woman', 'many', 'may', 'consider', 'league', 'Hitch', 'help', 'Albert', 'woo', 'Allegra', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'two', 'formed', 'meantime', 'Hitch', 'been', 'struck', 'cupids', 'arrow', 'falling', 'columnist', 'Sara', 'Meles', 'soon', 'discover', 'Hitch', 'as', 'helpless', 'men', 'two', 'couples', 'hilarity', 'ensues', 'audience', 'never', 'left', 'bored', 'wanting.As', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'expected', 'events', 'line', 'expose', 'Hitch', 'clientele', 'threaten', 'end', 'sets', 'blossoming', 'relationships', 'good', 'ride', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'one', 'chemistry', 'entire', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'James', 'Albert', 'enough', 'charm', 'tenderheartedness', 'audience', 'love', 'alongside', 'Allegra', 'Mendes', 'plays', 'Sara', 'enough', 'sass', 'smarts', 'can', 'easily', 'understand', 'why', 'Hitch', 'so', 'absorbed', 'Smith', 'may', 'be', 'star', 'cast', 'impressive', 'gladly', 'shares', 'spotlight', 'praise', 'co-stars', 'fun', 'breezy', 'entertainment', 'suitable', 'entire', 'family', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'favorite', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'late']",N/A

It has been a hard week and my wife and I needed something light.Wow!  We just got done watching this movie and I laughed more than I have laughed at a movie in a while!  It was funny.  It was romantic!Does it get predictable at parts?  Yes.  Does it cross into the ""cute"" realm a couple of times?  Yes.  It is not perfect, but it is a very good movie.Will Smith does an awesome job in the character.  Not many people can play the nerd-gone-player, but he pulls it off perfectly.  Eva Mendes does an awesome job as the love interest playing a character with just enough complication to make you buy in.  Kevin James is priceless and almost steals the show from Will Smith!  He is the ultimate underdog that you can't help but to cheer for!  Amber Valleta did a good job but she looks just enough like Cameron Diaz that you almost have Something About Mary flashbacks at some of the funny parts, but I mean that as a compliment.  Julie Ann Emery played the female underdog that reminded me of ""that single friend"" that most young wives seem to have when they get married.  We all knew someone like her character who just needed a chance with that one someone who was out there somewhere.All in all, this movie is not meant to be anything other than a good laugh with just enough romantic twist to make you want to snuggle a little tighter between the laughs.

Smith stars as Alex Hitchens, aka Hitch, the date doctor. He helps otherwise helpless guys find true love in only three dates. Hitch won't help just anybody. He's strictly off the radar and can only be found through referral. Hitch's clientel are men who want the real deal, not just a one night stand.The movie centers around Hitch and one of his clients named Albert (played by the hilarious Kevin James). Albert wants to date supermodel Allegra Cole. Hitch thinks this is crazy, but agrees to help, knowing how passionate Albert is about her. Meanwhile, Hitch meets a woman named Sara, who is a gossip columnist. This spells disaster already. Sara doesn't understand what Allegra Cole could possibly see in a dowdy, clutzy guy like Albert. Little does she know that the guy she's been seeing is the famed date doctor.It's a romantic comedy, so it's fairly predictable. But that doesn't make it any less fun. Will Smith is wonderful, come on, you knew he would be. Can't really expect less from Will Smith... we'll just forget about Wild Wild West...

Hitch does this by training men to behave on dates and how to handle women in the early stages of a relationship.

I can safely say it was worth seeing, through the entire film there was consistent laughter despite the cliche pattern it followed (boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back). Eva Mendes was excellent in her role injecting the appropriate amount of humor and snootiness. But the two people who stole the movie completely were Will Smith and Kevin James. Kevin James is always hilarious but when paired up with the equally hilarious Will Smith, well that's just cinematic magic.The basic plot follows Alex Hitchens, the 'date doctor', as he deals with his personal life and helps Albert win over his dream girl. However bland that may sound, the jokes along the way help the pace of the film greatly.You can say what you will about this type of movie but it's no doubt that Will Smith can make anything watchable. He exudes such personality that its hard to not like him. As for Kevin James, he's just funny as heck, he reminds me of a little tamer version of Chris Farley. The women in this film hold their ground surprisingly well, Eva Mendes is pretty funny and Amber Valetta shows real potential. This movie does have it's slow parts though. When Will is hung over from the allergy medication and Eva is talking to him, I thought that scene kind of drug on a little long. Then after Eva prints the article about Will, that was a bit slow as well, but each scene bounced back nicely.

The premise, itself, is a good premise, being more uplifting, and leads to a feel good sense at the end of the movie.

901752,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000957O7S,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[2, 3]","Will Smith stars in this movie as Alex Hitchens, a suave, smooth- talking fellow who knows his business and performs it well. The thing that makes the situation a little different is that Alex isn't in a traditional business. No, ""Hitch"" (as people call him) is in the business of love. He helps shy, awkward men find dates by coaching them on the right things to say and the right gestures to make. He is convinced that a man can get any woman if he follows the rules.Smith is the star of this movie, and he fits the part very well. It doesn't hurt that he has a fine supporting cast to back him up, including the likes of Kevin James, Eva Mendes, and Amber Valletta. I felt they all played their respective roles quite nicely, although I did find Eva Mendes character a little annoying after a while. On the other hand, Mendes is the one person who provides some suspense. She is a gossip columnist and the love interest of Will Smith. She isn't completely stable and she has erected an emotional fence when it comes to men. You don't really know what she is going to do from one scene to the next, and this makes her character a little more entertaining.What I like best about Hitch is that it gets you thinking about certain issues about dating, attraction, and ethics. Smith's character is convinced that a man can get the woman of his dreams, even if he isn't very good looking in comparison. There is some truth to this. I don't think any man can get any woman, but it is generally easier for a man with average or below average looks to get a girl who looks better than the other way around. Also, as Smith's character points out near the end, he only provides a catalyst for his clients to get the woman they want. What he is doing is ethical because it is the client himself that is really doing the work. If a relationship isn't meant to be, then no amount of coaching will help.One thing that I didn't like about this movie occurred near the beginning when Smith talked directly to the camera. Unless a film is a documentary, I don't think it's a good idea to have the actors and actresses talk to the camera, like they know a film is being made. Besides that, I think the pacing could have been picked up a little bit in places, too. But overall, ""Hitch"" still ranks as a good, entertaining motion picture.

But as it turns out, his first one ""Hitch"" is not bad and Will gets a little help from his co-star Kevin James.""Hitch"" is a man named Alex Hitchins (Will Smith).  He is a ""date doctor,"" meaning he helps pathetic guys to get really hot chicks that they would normally would not be able to get.  He has helped many men, and then comes Albert (Kevin James).  Albert is basically the type of guy that spills everything, says the wrong thing every time or does not have the nerve to say anything at all.  Albert wants to be able to get the movie star Allegra Coles.  So Hitch helps him and along the way he meets Sara Meles (Eva Mendes).  He falls for this girl and forgets everything that he teaches all of his clients by making a complete fool of himself.  Obviously thats where the humor comes in and then the dramtic climax of whether Hitch gets the girl or not.Will Smith does a great job as this character.  As mentioned earlier, his on-screen charisma makes him the perfect choice for this character.  The person that steals this movie from him is Kevin James.  Being a big ""King of Queens"" fan, he is the reason that I saw this movie and he did not disappoint.  Most of the movie's big laughs came from his antics.

He's the reason 'King of Queens' is one of my favorite shows (next to 'Yes, Dear')  Anyways, 'Hitch' revolves around Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens (Smith) who is a dating consultant for men who want to sweep the woman of their dreams off their feet.  His next job is poor Albert (James) who is in love with Alegra Cole, some rich high society sociallite, kinda like a soffisticated Paris Hilton.  So he enlists Hitch to help him get the girl.  And it works.  Now the real story here lies with Hitch falling in love with Sarah (Mendez) who is a gossip collumist who believes that the 'Date Doctor' is just an urban myth.  The problem with Hitch is that his own medicine doesn't seem to work on him and he just seems to screw everything up with the girl.  The great thing about this movie is that no matter who your watching your going to be laughing.  The movie as a whole is just really entertaining and very well put together.  Will Smith is always a good actor, very funny and he has that charm that makes you watch him.  But, as good as Smith is here he lacks that 'everyman' quality that makes Kevin the highlight of the film.  Watch this movie with that special someone, it's the perfect date movie and is a movie you can recommend to pretty much EVERYONE.",5,Kevin James is the 'King of Hitch',1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,1629,"['First', 'off', 'movie', 'just', 'great', 'wife', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'first', 'was', 'theater', 'had', 'forgotten', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'really', 'was', 'chemestry', 'charactors', 'perfect', 'Will', 'Kevin', 'have', 'real', 'presence', 'together', 'scene', 'stealer', 'always', 'Kevin', 'James', 'just', 'way', 'making', 'laugh', 'EVERYTHING', 'reason', ""'King"", 'Queens', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'next', ""'Yes"", 'Dear', 'Anyways', 'revolves', 'Alex', ""'Hitch"", 'Hitchens', 'Smith', 'who', 'dating', 'consultant', 'men', 'who', 'want', 'sweep', 'woman', 'dreams', 'feet', 'next', 'job', 'poor', 'Albert', 'James', 'who', 'love', 'Alegra', 'Cole', 'rich', 'high', 'society', 'sociallite', 'kinda', 'soffisticated', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'So', 'Hitch', 'help', 'get', 'girl', 'Now', 'real', 'story', 'here', 'Hitch', 'falling', 'love', 'Sarah', 'Mendez', 'who', 'gossip', 'collumist', 'who', ""'Date"", 'Doctor', 'just', 'urban', 'myth', 'problem', 'Hitch', 'own', 'medicine', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'just', 'screw', 'everything', 'up', 'girl', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', 'matter', 'who', 'watching', 'going', 'be', 'laughing', 'movie', 'whole', 'just', 'really', 'entertaining', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'Will', 'Smith', 'always', 'good', 'actor', 'very', 'funny', 'charm', 'watch', 'as', 'good', 'Smith', 'here', ""'everyman"", 'quality', 'Kevin', 'highlight', 'film', 'Watch', 'movie', 'special', 'someone', 'perfect', 'date', 'movie', 'movie', 'can', 'recommend', 'pretty', 'much', 'EVERYONE']",N/A
901774,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B000957O7S,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[2, 3]","Hitch is a movie that hooks the viewer right from the start.  The plot is original and fun.  Will Smith plays his character, Alex Hitchens, brilliantly!  I found myself actually rotting for ""Hitch"", otherwise known as ""The Date Doctor"", to help his clients attract the attention, and hopefully love, from their favorite members of the opposite sex.Smith has once again proven his ability as a star on the big screen.  He and his costars, Eva Mendez (Sara), Kevin James (Albert), Amber Valletta (Allegra Cole), and Julie Ann Emery (Casey), worked magic on the screen.  I judge all movies by how well the film grabs me, taking me on a ride that I forget it isn't real life I'm seeing.  Hitch has such great chemistry between the actors and actresses that I actually forgot I was watching a movie and just sat back and enjoyed the interaction between characters.  The director did a good job cutting out some of the scenes originally included in the filming.  Those were the only scenes that didn't quite work.When Will Smith and Kevin James are on screen together, they are hilarious.  The two reminded me of the same on screen chemistry Chris Farley and David Spade used to have on screen.  Now throw in the amazing Eva Mendez and this turns into a film that just can't miss.Hitch tries to help Albert get the woman of his dreams to notice he is even alive.  But Hitch doesn't stop there.  He teaches Albert how to make Allegra Cole not only notice him; he teaches him how to make her fall in love with him.  I won't give away the entire plot.  I'll just say this: If you are looking for a movie that has a little bit of everything in it, especially a script that should bring a smile to your face, you needn't look any further.

Just look at the cheesy Hollywood styling of the poster: Smith leaning on the word ""Hitch"" with an I'm-so-smooth grin, daring your expectations to be anything above waist-level.  Will Smith as the Date Doctor, selling his charm to nobodies-makes you want to rent Meet the Fockers again, doesn't it?  Fact is, ""Hitch"" does exactly what 90 percent of romantic comedies fail to do: sell you on its charm.  The writing abounds with cleverness and laugh-out-loud moments.  Urbane matchmaker Hitch has truer things to say about women and dating than Mel Gibson could learn through telepathy in ""What Women Want.""  Finally, Smith gets a role where his mastery of gesture matches smart dialog line for line.  And true to Hitch's belief in non-verbal communication, the movie boasts some great physical comedy.

Will Smith is perfect for the role of Alex Hitchens, a ""date doctor"" who can help men have a successful date. The most clueless men come to him for help- including Albert, a clumsy, overweight Average Joe, who desperately needs help getting a date with the love of his life, a society heiress. It is a lot of fun to witness their love story develop, as is the love story between Sara (played by Eve Mendes) and Alex.There was one part of the movie that I was confused about, however. I couldn't understand why Sara was so upset when she found out what Alex's real profession was. I don't believe he ""lied"" to her, persay; he just left things ambivalent. And why Sara, or any of the other women in this movie, should be so repelled by a guy who tries to give other men a hand with the opposite sex. Invasion of privacy, perhaps? Or manipulation?Hitch is a movie partly about how ""those who teach can't practice""- ie, Hitch can tell his men all they need to know about the opposite sex, but he has a hard time getting a date himself. The movie is also about how a pretty average guy and a society glamor girl can live happily ever after together.

901796,A1AVSW1LXGBO4Y,B000957O7S,"Evan Hinton ""Critic for Hire""","[4, 4]","While February is often not a great month for blockbusters, it is the season for the romantic comedy, what with Valentine's Day and all.  And every once in a while, the ever elusive GOOD romantic comedy shows up, with the right level of sweetness, humor, and drama to make good movie entertainment.  I am notorious for being hard on these sorts of films, but I do try to remain as objective as possible.  Will Smith's latest comedy, ""Hitch"" comes pretty close to being an excellent picture, romantic or otherwise, but just misses the mark.Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens (Smith) or, as he is colloquially known, the Date Doctor, is a professional love consultant, if there is such a thing.  He teaches the Regular Joe how to be suave, cool, and get the attention of a desired female.  His latest client, a klutzy accountant named Albert (Kevin James), has fallen head-over-heels for the beautiful celebrity Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta).  Personally, I would be wary of somebody with the same name as an allergy medication, but to each his own.  In any case, Hitch coaches Albert on the ways of dating and making first impressions, and Albert and Allegra seem to really hit it off.But Hitch has his own love problems.  He's trying to catch the eye of a lovely (though highly cynical) gossip columnist named Sara (Eva Mendes), but through bad luck and some rather humorous accidents, he comes across as a total dipstick.  Or at least he SHOULD, but Sara finds him endearing anyway.Hitch also hands out some free advice, apparently to the viewing audience, such as ""ninety percent of what you're saying isn't coming out of your mouth.""  Your actions and body language can say more about you than anything you can.  So guys, take some notes at this one.The thing I really appreciated about this movie was that even though he was basically setting up guys to score, Hitch had strong feelings about making good, solid relationships, rather than just one-night stands.  It's a good moral standard that is severely lacking in America in general and the entertainment industry in particular.  Hitch doesn't just teach guys how to impress the girls, he teaches them how to be nicer people in general.Most comedies run at about an hour and a half, mainly because they run out of funny things to do after that.  But ""Hitch"" works at two hours because its story is complex enough, and the characters are endearing enough, to last that long on screen without seeming like a drag.The only real flaw I could see was that the movie was perhaps a bit too sweet.  It's nice to see a so-called romantic comedy devoid of bathroom humor for once, but the whole warm-fuzzy thing got a little tiresome in places.So, as a Valentine's Month (because that's really what February is) film, ""Hitch"" is all right.  It's got some nice platitudes, and an overall sweet theme, but all that sugar might be a little unhealthy.",4,"""Hitch"" is like most candy: good, but too sweet",1108166400,"02 12, 2005",2005,2882,"['February', 'often', 'not', 'great', 'month', 'blockbusters', 'season', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'what', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'once', 'while', 'ever', 'elusive', 'GOOD', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'up', 'right', 'level', 'sweetness', 'humor', 'drama', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'am', 'notorious', 'being', 'hard', 'sorts', 'films', 'do', 'try', 'remain', 'as', 'objective', 'possible', 'Will', 'Smith', 'latest', 'comedy', 'Hitch', 'pretty', 'close', 'being', 'excellent', 'picture', 'romantic', 'otherwise', 'just', 'mark.Alex', 'Hitch', 'Hitchens', 'Smith', 'colloquially', 'known', 'Date', 'Doctor', 'professional', 'love', 'consultant', 'such', 'thing', 'Regular', 'Joe', 'how', 'be', 'suave', 'cool', 'get', 'attention', 'desired', 'female', 'latest', 'client', 'klutzy', 'accountant', 'named', 'Albert', 'Kevin', 'James', 'fallen', 'head-over-heels', 'beautiful', 'celebrity', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'Amber', 'Valletta', 'Personally', 'would', 'be', 'wary', 'somebody', 'same', 'name', 'allergy', 'medication', 'own', 'case', 'Hitch', 'Albert', 'ways', 'dating', 'making', 'first', 'impressions', 'Albert', 'Allegra', 'seem', 'really', 'hit', 'off.But', 'Hitch', 'own', 'love', 'problems', 'trying', 'catch', 'eye', 'lovely', 'highly', 'cynical', 'gossip', 'columnist', 'named', 'Sara', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'bad', 'luck', 'rather', 'humorous', 'accidents', 'across', 'total', 'dipstick', 'least', 'SHOULD', 'Sara', 'endearing', 'anyway.Hitch', 'also', 'out', 'free', 'advice', 'apparently', 'viewing', 'audience', 'such', 'ninety', 'percent', 'what', ""'re"", 'saying', ""n't"", 'coming', 'mouth', 'actions', 'body', 'language', 'can', 'say', 'more', 'anything', 'can', 'So', 'guys', 'take', 'notes', 'one.The', 'thing', 'really', 'appreciated', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'was', 'basically', 'setting', 'up', 'guys', 'score', 'Hitch', 'had', 'strong', 'feelings', 'making', 'good', 'solid', 'relationships', 'rather', 'just', 'one-night', 'stands', 'good', 'moral', 'standard', 'severely', 'lacking', 'America', 'general', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'particular', 'Hitch', ""n't"", 'just', 'teach', 'guys', 'how', 'impress', 'girls', 'how', 'be', 'nicer', 'people', 'general.Most', 'comedies', 'run', 'hour', 'half', 'mainly', 'run', 'funny', 'things', 'do', 'Hitch', 'two', 'hours', 'story', 'complex', 'enough', 'characters', 'are', 'endearing', 'enough', 'last', 'long', 'screen', 'seeming', 'drag.The', 'only', 'real', 'flaw', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'sweet', 'nice', 'see', 'so-called', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'devoid', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'once', 'whole', 'warm-fuzzy', 'thing', 'got', 'little', 'tiresome', 'places.So', 'Valentine', 'Month', 'really', 'what', 'February', 'film', 'Hitch', 'right', 'got', 'nice', 'platitudes', 'overall', 'sweet', 'theme', 'sugar', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'unhealthy']",N/A

Director Andy Tennant did an excellent job with this film. Various types of humor are incorperated into the film as well as the romantic factor for all you date movie people. This would best be described as a Comedy with romantic elements, not a romantic comedy.We will start with the star Will Smith, I for one think it is great to see him in something else other then a big budget sci-fi flick again. And he did a excellent job in his first role in this type of film, his preformance is amazing. His charisma and screen precence make his character very belivable. Of course that changes after meeting his love, and he becomes a clumsy idiot, and he plays it greatly.That brings some one that was miscast, EVA MENDAS. I like her, infact I love her but she just didn't work in this role. She gave what she could, but the preformance wasn't belivable. That's all I can say about that, nothing more nothing less.Now comes the highlight of the film, the one and only KEVIN JAMES. What can one say about this brilliant preformance. Why dosn't this man make some more movies in his off time from his excellent show ""KING OF QUEENS"". Kevin's preformance is so good, so brilliant, so belivable it is nothing short of a classic preformance. His nice guy shy role fits him perfectlly, so much so that when he isn't on screen you are left waiting and wanting more of Mr James. Most of the films best moments happen because of him, the ending is a perfect example, or his early dance scene with Will.Which brings me to the on screen chemestry of these two brilliant preformers. When both are on screen you will laugh with out a doubt. After the film is over you might be left wanting to see more of them together again on the big screen. The chemestry between the two is amazing, no team I can remember has done so well together since Samual & John on ""PULP FICTION"". I'am sure there have been other great teams like Farley & spade in ""TOMMEY BOY"", but none have done so in the recent onslaught of terrible movies to come out lately.Thankfully this film is a gem in the film industry, and I can't wait to own it on dvd when it is released.",5,KEVIN JAMES & WILL SMITH MAKE THE PERFECT ON SCREEN TEAM.,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,2311,"['First', 'off', 'have', 'admit', 'big', 'reason', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'KING', 'OF', 'QUEENS', 'Kevin', 'James', 'also', 'helped', 'very', 'talented', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Director', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'film', 'Various', 'types', 'humor', 'are', 'incorperated', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'romantic', 'factor', 'date', 'movie', 'people', 'would', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'Comedy', 'romantic', 'elements', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy.We', 'will', 'start', 'star', 'Will', 'Smith', 'one', 'think', 'great', 'see', 'something', 'else', 'other', 'then', 'big', 'budget', 'sci-fi', 'flick', 'again', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'first', 'role', 'type', 'film', 'preformance', 'amazing', 'charisma', 'screen', 'precence', 'make', 'character', 'very', 'belivable', 'course', 'changes', 'meeting', 'love', 'clumsy', 'idiot', 'one', 'was', 'miscast', 'EVA', 'MENDAS', 'infact', 'love', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'role', 'gave', 'what', 'could', 'preformance', 'was', ""n't"", 'belivable', 'can', 'say', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less.Now', 'highlight', 'film', 'one', 'only', 'KEVIN', 'JAMES', 'What', 'can', 'one', 'say', 'brilliant', 'preformance', 'Why', 'dos', ""n't"", 'man', 'make', 'more', 'movies', 'off', 'time', 'excellent', 'show', 'KING', 'OF', 'QUEENS', 'Kevin', 'preformance', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'brilliant', 'so', 'belivable', 'nothing', 'short', 'classic', 'preformance', 'nice', 'guy', 'shy', 'role', 'perfectlly', 'so', 'much', 'when', ""n't"", 'screen', 'are', 'left', 'waiting', 'wanting', 'more', 'Mr', 'James', 'Most', 'films', 'best', 'moments', 'happen', 'ending', 'perfect', 'example', 'early', 'dance', 'scene', 'Will.Which', 'screen', 'chemestry', 'two', 'brilliant', 'preformers', 'When', 'are', 'screen', 'will', 'laugh', 'out', 'doubt', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'left', 'wanting', 'see', 'more', 'together', 'again', 'big', 'screen', 'chemestry', 'two', 'amazing', 'team', 'can', 'remember', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'Samual', 'John', 'PULP', 'FICTION', ""I'am"", 'sure', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'great', 'teams', 'Farley', 'spade', 'TOMMEY', 'BOY', 'none', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'recent', 'onslaught', 'terrible', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'lately.Thankfully', 'film', 'gem', 'film', 'industry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'own', 'dvd', 'when', 'released']",N/A

He steals this film in every scene he's in.Will Smith, Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens, plays straight-man to Kevin James' Albert, and the chemistry works.Alex is the ""Date Doctor"". With his coaching he believes he can help any man land his perfect soul mate. Albert is a rotund accountant on a team of accountants for the millionaire heiress Allegra Cole, whom Albert is in love. With Alex's help Albert is able to get up the nerve to ask Allegra Cole out, and the rest is comical genius. The Will Smith - Kevin James dance instruction sequence alone is more than worth the price of admission.[...]",5,Worth the Full Price of Admission,1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,1180,"['nothing', 'like', 'more', 'world', 'be', 'wrong', 'movie', 'believed', 'be', 'bad', 'go', 'see', 'then', 'be', 'wrong', '..', 'course', 'opposite', 'true', 'believed', 'movie', 'be', 'good', 'not', 'way', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'later', '..Sorry', 'have', 'started', 'ramble', '..', 'again', 'Back', 'review.Before', 'seeing', 'film', 'had', 'preconceived', 'notion', 'being', 'Will', 'Smith', 'girl', 'girl', 'only', 'find', 'girl', 'again', 'end', 'movie', 'part', 'was', 'correct', 'one', 'small', 'exception', 'Kevin', 'James', 'film', 'scene', 'in.Will', 'Smith', 'Alex', ""'Hitch"", 'Hitchens', 'straight-man', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Albert', 'chemistry', 'works.Alex', 'Date', 'Doctor', 'coaching', 'can', 'help', 'man', 'perfect', 'soul', 'mate', 'Albert', 'rotund', 'accountant', 'team', 'accountants', 'millionaire', 'heiress', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'whom', 'Albert', 'love', 'Alex', 'help', 'Albert', 'able', 'get', 'up', 'nerve', 'ask', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'rest', 'comical', 'genius', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Kevin', 'James', 'dance', 'instruction', 'sequence', 'alone', 'more', 'price', 'admission.', '[', ']']",N/A

901800,A5DXP7QPGR5A0,B000957O7S,Gianmarco Manzione,"[17, 20]","Anyone who knows anything about me understands that I am the last person on earth to volunteer my money for a film under the dreaded category of ""romantic comedy."" Just go see the maudlin, juvenile ""Wedding Date"" to see why. Admittedly, I am a bitter, misanthropic bookworm who spends more time alone than a mole in the ground. But that doesn't mean that I can't see where the good laughs are to be had, and ""Hitch,"" judging from the previews, was certainly one of those places. Thankfully, the promise of the previews was fulfilled. It is only February, but ""Hitch"" will probably go down as one of 2005's guilty pleasures.Like the recent summer flick ""Harold and Kumar go to Whitecastle,"" this is one of those few gems capable of helping us take ourselves a little less seriously, laugh at how silly we are and lighten up about the big things: life, love, desire. As with most any comedy -- romantic or otherwise -- ""Hitch"" boats its share of condescendingly predictable twists and turns, and nearly derails toward the end in a desperate attempt at tying all loose knots with flowery ribbons. The final sequence in which Hitch (Will Smith) pulls out all the stops to land his heartthrob is just preposterous and almost as disastrous as the final, unendurably mawkish scenes of ""The Terminal"" last year.But I think that a romantic comedy is the kind of movie you can decide to like or dislike before you ever set foot inside the theater. You have to be reasonable -- a romantic comedy is the last sort of movie you want to burden with ambitious expectations. But, even for a cynic like me who has a lot of trouble following that advice, I have to say that ""Hitch"" works surprisingly well, despite its typical flaws. Will Smith's alluring confidence is on display here, trading in the malodramatic and brooding pomposity of ""I, Robot"" for a far friendlier and memorable role as a ""love Doctor"" capable of turning any man's wildest dreams into reality.When his services are demanded by Albert (Kevin James), a withdrawn, hopeless and overweight accountant, an unlikely magic ignites on screen between two phenomenally talented actors who both stumbled onto the right script. The scenes in which Hitch shows Albert the moves and the ropes are just hysterical, as when Albert shows off his geeky dance moves or fumbles through a phone call to Allegra Cole, his crush, eventually succumbing to his hilarious clumsiness with a crash. James is the big surprise of the film, but Smith carries himself just as well. His battle against a terrible food allergy is just hysterical, and his disastrous first date with Sara Melas (Eva Mendez) is very funny.I was surprised at just how consistently entertaining this film was without giving in to the temptations that most films like this can't resist. For the first 80% of the film, we are not always told how to think about what we're seeing or how to feel about the characters and their decisions. Not all the work is done for us. We are allowed to laugh without being told why we're laughing, and that's an achievement most romantic comedies just can't claim. ""Hitch"" makes for a fantastic date movie and might even give some cynics like myself a glimpse of the bright side. I recommend it.",4,A Cut Above the Usual Tedium of Romantic Comedy,1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,3229,"['Anyone', 'who', 'anything', 'am', 'last', 'person', 'earth', 'volunteer', 'money', 'film', 'dreaded', 'category', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Just', 'go', 'see', 'maudlin', 'juvenile', 'Wedding', 'Date', 'see', 'why', 'Admittedly', 'am', 'bitter', 'misanthropic', 'bookworm', 'who', 'more', 'time', 'alone', 'mole', 'ground', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'where', 'good', 'laughs', 'are', 'be', 'had', 'Hitch', 'judging', 'previews', 'was', 'certainly', 'one', 'places', 'Thankfully', 'promise', 'previews', 'was', 'fulfilled', 'only', 'February', 'Hitch', 'will', 'probably', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', '2005', 'guilty', 'recent', 'summer', 'flick', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'go', 'Whitecastle', 'one', 'few', 'gems', 'capable', 'helping', 'take', 'little', 'less', 'seriously', 'laugh', 'how', 'silly', 'are', 'lighten', 'up', 'big', 'things', 'life', 'love', 'desire', 'most', 'comedy', 'romantic', 'otherwise', 'Hitch', 'share', 'condescendingly', 'predictable', 'twists', 'turns', 'nearly', 'derails', 'end', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'tying', 'loose', 'knots', 'flowery', 'ribbons', 'final', 'sequence', 'Hitch', 'Will', 'Smith', 'out', 'stops', 'land', 'heartthrob', 'just', 'preposterous', 'almost', 'as', 'disastrous', 'final', 'unendurably', 'mawkish', 'scenes', 'Terminal', 'last', 'year.But', 'think', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'kind', 'movie', 'can', 'decide', 'like', 'dislike', 'ever', 'set', 'foot', 'theater', 'have', 'be', 'reasonable', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'last', 'sort', 'movie', 'want', 'burden', 'ambitious', 'expectations', 'even', 'cynic', 'who', 'lot', 'trouble', 'following', 'advice', 'have', 'say', 'Hitch', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'typical', 'flaws', 'Will', 'Smith', 'alluring', 'confidence', 'display', 'here', 'trading', 'malodramatic', 'brooding', 'pomposity', 'Robot', 'far', 'friendlier', 'memorable', 'role', 'love', 'Doctor', 'capable', 'turning', 'man', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'reality.When', 'services', 'are', 'demanded', 'Albert', 'Kevin', 'James', 'withdrawn', 'hopeless', 'overweight', 'accountant', 'unlikely', 'magic', 'ignites', 'screen', 'two', 'phenomenally', 'talented', 'actors', 'who', 'stumbled', 'right', 'script', 'scenes', 'Hitch', 'Albert', 'moves', 'ropes', 'are', 'just', 'hysterical', 'when', 'Albert', 'geeky', 'dance', 'moves', 'fumbles', 'phone', 'call', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'crush', 'eventually', 'succumbing', 'hilarious', 'clumsiness', 'crash', 'James', 'big', 'surprise', 'film', 'Smith', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'battle', 'terrible', 'food', 'allergy', 'just', 'hysterical', 'disastrous', 'first', 'date', 'Sara', 'Melas', 'Eva', 'Mendez', 'very', 'funny.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'film', 'was', 'giving', 'temptations', 'most', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'first', '80', '%', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'told', 'how', 'think', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'how', 'feel', 'characters', 'decisions', 'Not', 'work', 'done', 'are', 'allowed', 'laugh', 'being', 'told', 'why', ""'re"", 'laughing', 'achievement', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'claim', 'Hitch', 'fantastic', 'date', 'movie', 'might', 'even', 'give', 'cynics', 'glimpse', 'bright', 'side', 'recommend']",N/A

Using a script that uses every clich&eacute; from the myriad other films that tell this same story gimmick using females in the Smith role of date doctor, this movie limps along with silly dialogue and pratfall type of comedy, all of which could be forgiven if there was a magical chemistry between the two top stars to make it click.For all the talent Will Smith has demonstrated in the past (despite his recent over the top laffapaloozas like 'I, Robot', 'Men in Black I & II', 'Bad Boys I & II') such as 'Ali', 'Six Degrees of Separation', 'The Legend of Bagger Vance', he seems bent on accepting roles that are beneath him. In this bit of fluff he wastes time talking directly to the audience about the fine art of capturing a girl and then demonstrates his techniques ad infinitum on some blundering characters, ultimately  trying to apply his own wisdom in courting Eva Mendes. At this point there should be romantic magic to make this dud work, but the chemistry between the two is so polar that we are forced to wait out a dating game that is less interesting than a Home Depot commercial.The direction is sluggish when it begs to be slick and the acting is rudimentary at best.

901813,ANYDF6GKK7PA4,B000957O7S,"Jackson Zhou ""The Craftsman""","[0, 1]","Out of the clutter of other less-memorable romantic comedies in the recent past, I find ""Hitch"" to be somewhat refreshing.  Although the most of the story is nothing too original, the idea of a ""date doctor"" brings a nice little twist, and the cast delivers a decent performance.  Will Smith, memorable for his suave and arrogant characters in ""Fresh Prince of BelAir"" and ""Bad Boys"", had seemingly grown up in this movie.  He handles his ""date doctor"" character with not just easy-going humor but also maturity, something that isn't seen too often in his other works.  Surprisingly, the person that delivered the most amount of comic relief in this film is Kevin James' Albert Brenneman, a clumsy businessman who is desperate to win the affection of his beautiful and high-society client Allegra Cole, played by Amber Valleta.  James' performance is entertaining in his unabashed goofiness.  Without him the movie wouldn't have been as enjoyable.I do have to agree with most people the ending and the way that it was set up was pretty weak.  When Eva Mendes' character dumps Will Smith based on a gross misunderstanding, it was somehow Smith's character who had to come begging in the end to win Mendes back.  It was unfair and unconvincing.  But otherwise, this is good bang for your buck if you want something light-hearted and romantic.",3,Clever and Enjoyable,1119657600,"06 25, 2005",2005,1340,"['clutter', 'other', 'less-memorable', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'recent', 'past', 'find', 'Hitch', 'be', 'somewhat', 'refreshing', 'most', 'story', 'nothing', 'too', 'original', 'idea', 'date', 'doctor', 'nice', 'little', 'twist', 'cast', 'decent', 'performance', 'Will', 'Smith', 'memorable', 'suave', 'arrogant', 'characters', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'BelAir', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'had', 'seemingly', 'grown', 'up', 'movie', 'date', 'doctor', 'character', 'not', 'just', 'easy-going', 'humor', 'also', 'maturity', 'something', ""n't"", 'seen', 'too', 'often', 'other', 'works', 'Surprisingly', 'person', 'delivered', 'most', 'amount', 'comic', 'relief', 'film', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Albert', 'Brenneman', 'clumsy', 'businessman', 'who', 'desperate', 'win', 'affection', 'beautiful', 'high-society', 'client', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'played', 'Amber', 'Valleta', 'James', 'performance', 'entertaining', 'unabashed', 'goofiness', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'enjoyable.I', 'do', 'have', 'agree', 'most', 'people', 'ending', 'way', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'was', 'pretty', 'weak', 'When', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'character', 'dumps', 'Will', 'Smith', 'based', 'gross', 'misunderstanding', 'was', 'somehow', 'Smith', 'character', 'who', 'had', 'come', 'begging', 'end', 'win', 'Mendes', 'back', 'was', 'unfair', 'unconvincing', 'otherwise', 'good', 'bang', 'buck', 'want', 'something', 'light-hearted', 'romantic']",N/A
901814,A3F3B6HY9RJI04,B000957O7S,James Duckett,"[0, 0]","What you are about to see in no way resembles real life.  There is no date doctor that will cut down the boundaries between two people to get them to meet up.  There is no way a beautiful and famous movie star would hook up with an unemployed accountant the way they did in the movie.  And when it comes to dialogue, people just don't talk the way they did in this movie.  So, if you are going to see this movie, please understand that reality is not reflected at all in this movie.But if you would like a silly and cute romantic comedy, then you might want to check this out.... at a video store.  I wouldn't recommend buying it because I think watching it once will be enough.But I do have a bone to pick with the humor of this movie.  Every single funny part of this movie was shown in the previews.  There was nothing really funny that I hadn't seen before watching the movie.  All that was left was the kind of funny parts.And, let's be honest, if this movie did not have Will Smith and Kevin James then it would have been a complete dud.  Why?  Because they are fantastic.First, Will Smith.  I've always loved Will Smith.  He has a charisma that carries naturally on the screen and I look forward to every movie he is in (okay, I haven't caught ""Ali"" yet).  Though he plays the same character in every movie (goofy, funny, full of energy, and loveable) he is still a character that I can't get enough of.  And he doesn't disappoint in this movie.  For a first venture into a romantic comedy I think he did well with the script provided him.And then Kevin James.  I haven't watched his show ""King of Queens"" and I don't know of any movie he has done, but I really hope to see more of Kevin James.  He did his role well and I couldn't think of anybody else that could have played that part better.  Kevin James nailed his character perfectly.  I see a great star rising.So, who should see this?  Well, anybody who likes a decent romantic comedy or even a regular comedy should watch it once.  Rent it, don't buy.

He doesn't just advise them--he hangs around and monitors their performance. He begins by saying that women don't really mean it when they say that they are just into their careers, etc. He coaches men according to the principle that most communication is through body language. For instance, he tells men that, when a woman wants no kiss at the end of the date, she just takes out her keys and opens the door. But when she does want a goodnight kiss, she fiddles around with her keys. That is the signal for men to watch for.The ""date doctor' succeeds with even seemingly-impossible cases. Albert, a taciturn, nerdy, heavyset, completely-bumbling fellow, gets dates with no less than Allegra, a popular beauty queen. Spectators can't believe it. In time, this makes it into the tabloids, provoking such a furious response in Albert that he trashes the store carrying the tabloids and gets himself arrested.Hitch's own girlfriend is Sara, who is highly cynical of men in general. She reacts with contempt when she learns of the very existence of a ""date doctor"", and then is furious with Hitch when she learns that he is in fact the one. She even throws things at him. Sara and the other women feel manipulated at the thought of their men's actions having been coached come-ons, not genuine romantic expressions.So Hitch's world seems to fall apart. The heartaches are unbearable. Can Hitch win back Sara? Will Albert get Allegra back?

Hitch may have finally met his greatest challenge in Albert Brennaman (Kevin James).  Albert is a junior financial offecer who handles the account of heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta).  Albert is desperate to have a relationship with Allegra, so he goes to Hitch for help.Hitch is skeptical at first, but he decides to try to help him.  This is the beginning of a friendship between Hitch and Albert.  Soon, Albert is going to fancy art galleries and New York Knicks games with Allegra.  Meanwhile, Hitch has found a woman that he likes.  Her name is Sara Melas (Eva Mendes).  She works as a newspaper gossip columnist. Hitch is immediately attracted to her, and the two begin dating.  In the meantime, Sara has seen the photos of Allegra and Albert that have been appearing in the papers.

Kevin James makes an impressive first outing with movies, he is hilarious in the movie, and actually takes the joke and makes it funnier than it is. somehow, I felt the script was weak, I felt that some moments were forced, and some of the Humor was so fast that you didn't have time to think about the joke. Will Smith at times was a little too confident in his role, I think he felt that he WAS the character, when I think that he could've taken situations and used his humor to make it funnier.The movie wasn't a masterpiece but it is WAY better than some movies that have been released that call themselves ""Romantic Comedies"". Andy Tennant, Director, did a good job but.... could've gotten better performances by cast. The writers in the other hand needed to write something original, and instead of the clich&eacute;s'. There are definitely some silly scenes, which some aren't quite realistic, but the other are so true to life that it hits you square in the eyes. the things I appreciated the most about Hitch is that it is free of the overt sexual innuendos that are so common and accepted in most romantic comedies... it could almost be rated PG.To sum it up it's a movie about a guy who helps guys get the girl of their dreams to fall in love.

With that said, this movie was not without its extremely boring and over dramitic moments. The film is broke into three parts, when will smiths character is on the screen with his love interest, when kevin james character is on the screen with his love interest, and when kevin james and will smith are together (will smith teaching kevin james how to get and keep his love interest). The differnce between these three parts is whenever kevin james is involved in the plot or movie you are going to laugh. Whenever will smith is alone with his love interest you are going to bored out of your mind. I found my only problem with this film was not enough kevin james. Now granted he shares alot of the movie with will smith, but will smith made me laugh maybe once or twice. Whereas kevin james made me laugh almost ever time he was on the screen. As far as the plot goes it is your typical chick flick cliche, the stars (smith and james) fall in love with two women, then something happens of course where smith and james love interests become broken hearted when certain secreats are found out, then the movie turns into whether or not smith and james will reunite and find love.

However him working as a love doctor only gets interesting when Kevin James' (The King of Queens) character is introduced. That's when you get all the laughs and when the movie comes to life. He plays a nice heavy guy who's desperatly in love with a rich popular women. So Smith does everything in his power to make him cool. Their scenes together are great and when the movie works the most. The Smith story just isn't as good alone  without James so thank god for him. Don't get me wrong the Smith scenes where he's trying to get a girl but keeps messing up are pretty funny. James though with his goofy dancing and charm steals the movie everytime he's on screen.

901834,ACTG0NWGJMNSM,B000957O7S,"John Larsen ""Johncritic""","[1, 2]","Date doctor Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens (Will Smith) is the personification of the old adage: Those who can't, teach; and those who can't teach, teach gym. Hitch doesn't teach gym, but he gets quite a workout paving the road to romance for his clients. When it comes to his own happiness, Hitch takes the road less traveled, one filled with hilarious potholes and the occasional speed bump.Speed bumps aren't enough to stop Hitch, a cheerfully zany film that shoves star Will Smith into the romantic comedy spotlight, where the former Fresh Prince seems very comfortable. Even when dark clouds of contrived plot complications arrive in the third act, Smith still shines. He's winning as a man who can seemingly fix any relationship but lacks the discipline to help himself.Hitch exudes confidence as he guides New York's lonely hearts into each other's arms, taking on his biggest challenge in good natured slob Albert Brennaman (Kevin James). Overweight, shy, and lacking self-esteem, Albert not only has a big heart, but big aspirations. He is smitten with beautiful socialite Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), who only sees Albert as one of her corporate accountants.Just as Hitch embarks on his latest mission, he encounters gossip columnist Sara Melas (Eva Mendes), who totally rearranges his mental Feng Shui. It's at this juncture that Hitch reaches its potential, drawing laughs from not one but three different sets of unions: Albert and Allegra, Hitch and Sara, and funniest of all, Hitch and Albert. Watching Smith and James (The King of Queens) go through the motions is a hoot, especially when it comes to the more delicate matters of the heart.Writer Kevin Bisch finds plenty of humor in the premise, and even though he uses shorthand to get the ball rolling, never shortchanges the characters or their motives. Even when the script veers towards slapstick comedy, it never feels like a cheat. Instead, the actors make these moments their own, allowing us to embrace rather than reject the silliness.When Hitch isn't being silly it's actually quite smart. The film has a lot to say about the condition of the human heart, and why someone like Hitch exists. He's slick and effective, something Hitch lacks when the tables are turned. Eva Mendes (Stuck On You) is a real sport as Sara, who literally turns the doctor into a babbling patient. Smith rarely portrays characters that lack confidence, and watching him trying to hinder Hitch's slide is quite engaging.James is equally effective and sincere, making us believe not only can someone like Albert win the heart of someone like Allegra, he deserves to. Likewise, Amber Valletta equalizes the rich bitch socialite role with a sympathetic nod, turning a caricature into flesh and blood person. A lot of romantic comedies are played so broad it becomes impossible to identify with or invest in the characters. We not only like these characters, we want to see them succeed.

He isn't a sleaze who teaches them to lie and con their way forward, he helps build their confidence and form a plan so they don't look like fools. His latest challenge is Albert (Kevin James), a portly tax accountant who lusts after a glamorous heiress. While Hitch is coaching Albert in the toughest assignment of his career, he also pursues a reporter for a New York tabloid. As one might expect in a romantic comedy, misunderstandings ensue and both Hitch and Albert will have to struggle if they want to capture true love.Will Smith is one of the most likeable personas around and he exudes his usual easy charm here. The ethics of his profession had the potential to get dicey, but it's made very clear that he doesn't help guys score, he helps men looking for love. Just as most shrinks seem to be emotionally damaged, so too the love doctor is suffering the long-term effects of a broken heart. Hitch is charming and witty with a woman but letting her inside is a bit too scary. Albert is the opposite, of course. A big teddy bear who would declare his love for the heiress before she knew his name (with disastrous results) if he didn't have Hitch to advise him. The training sessions with the two of them are probably the most enjoyable of the whole movie and certainly enjoyable.If there was a downside to the movie, it was the character of Sara, Hitch's love interest. She is so judgmental and shrill that I found myself wishing that Hitch would find someone a lot more pleasant to pursue.

901840,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000957O7S,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 3]","Typically when I'm choosing a movie to watch in my spare time, I will choose from action, drama, comedy, sci-fi, thrillers, etc. (what you would basically expect from any guy), I can honestly say that I very rarely choose a romantic comedy, and never a musical. However, sometimes a romantic comedy comes along that looks interesting and funny to me, generally because the premise is different from most or because I like the stars in it, or simply because my wife chooses the movie for our movie night. In the case of ""Hitch"" it was a combination of the first 2 factors, but for some reason my wife and I never got around to watching this movie in theaters, and for the longest time on DVD. But recently, we sat down and watched it, and I must say that even though many critics and some moviegoers weren't entertained that much by the movie, I found it to be highly enjoyable and one of the better romantic comedies I had seen.""Hitch"" is the story of Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens (Will Smith), a man whose job is to find ways for a man to successfully woo the woman of his choice into a successful dating relationship. Hitch is a man that is good at his job, but never really finds the time for his own dating life. When Hitch begins coaching a pudgy accountant (Kevin James) on how to get noticed by an attractive, wealthy heiress, his own love life begins to blossom, but through a series of mishaps starts to go horribly awry. Inevitably leaving Hitch wondering why he can make love happen for complete strangers but never for himself. But before he can figure out what's going on in his life, a newsreporter (Eva Mendes) is trying to uncover the true identity of this so-called 'Date Doctor', and after protecting his identity for so long Hitch finds himself in the media crosshairs, and the real kicker is, it's his new girlfriend that put him there.As far as romantic comedies go, most of them are generally predictable to some extent, sometimes the predictability of these types of films lends to boredom for me. However, there are a few romantic comedies that manage to be predictable, yet still entertain, and then there are the few (very few) that just surprise you by not being all that predictable. ""Hitch"" falls somewhere between somewhat predictable and not all that much, there are the typical romantic comedy elements that are crucial for this type of film. For example, guy finds girl, impresses girl, things get serious, some secret about guy is discovered by girl, girl breaks up with guy, guy proclaims love for girl, and all is well with the world - those are your basic elements (give or take one or two) to almost every romantic comedy these days, and ""Hitch"" contains several of them. The difference for me was that unlike a lot of other romantic comedies where the story is so thin and the humor is virtually non-existent that you find yourself already knowing how the movie will end and checking your eyelids for holes within the first 30 minutes due to boredom, ""Hitch"" keeps things going at a very steady pace with plenty of laughs and clever dialogue that I never got distracted by getting ahead of the story, and remained entertained throughout. Probably the element I enjoyed the most of the movie was the way the character of Hitch had taken a by-the-book approach to dating, as far as his tips go, that worked like a charm for every guy that he tutored, yet could never get the same approach to work for him, and in the end he discovers that love, much like life, isn't always so simply figured out.The performances by the cast were uniformly strong, Will Smith and Kevin James out-shined everyone, which wasn't really all that surprising given their comedic and acting talents. Eva Mendes was very endearing as the woman that Hitch is trying to start a relationship with, and she shows a great on-screen chemistry with Will Smith that made their couple very believable. The story as I said earlier contained many of the familiar elements of most romantic comedies, yet still entertained me, and I never felt like I'd seen it all before. The ending is what you expect, and of course hope for in this type of movie, but the execution of the ending was done in a very interesting and unique way that I didn't expect, probably making it a much more enjoyable ending than most.With all of that being said, ""Hitch"" isn't the most original romantic comedy, but there are numerous elements that are unique, and allowed me to overlook the same old elements that are so tried and true to this genre. It was a very entertaining movie, that provides you plenty of laughter and leaves you feeling good, which is what these movies should do.""Hitch"" is rated PG-13 for language and sensuality.",4,The Cure for the Common Man...,1182988800,"06 28, 2007",2007,4706,"['Typically', 'when', ""'m"", 'choosing', 'movie', 'watch', 'spare', 'time', 'will', 'choose', 'action', 'drama', 'comedy', 'sci-fi', 'thrillers', 'etc', 'what', 'would', 'basically', 'expect', 'guy', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'very', 'rarely', 'choose', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'never', 'musical', 'However', 'sometimes', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'interesting', 'funny', 'generally', 'premise', 'different', 'most', 'like', 'stars', 'simply', 'wife', 'movie', 'movie', 'night', 'case', 'Hitch', 'was', 'combination', 'first', '2', 'factors', 'reason', 'wife', 'never', 'got', 'watching', 'movie', 'theaters', 'longest', 'time', 'DVD', 'recently', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'must', 'say', 'even', 'many', 'critics', 'moviegoers', 'were', ""n't"", 'entertained', 'much', 'movie', 'found', 'be', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'better', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'had', 'seen', 'Hitch', 'story', 'Alex', ""'Hitch"", 'Hitchens', 'Will', 'Smith', 'man', 'job', 'find', 'ways', 'man', 'successfully', 'woo', 'woman', 'choice', 'successful', 'dating', 'relationship', 'Hitch', 'man', 'good', 'job', 'never', 'really', 'time', 'own', 'dating', 'life', 'When', 'Hitch', 'coaching', 'pudgy', 'accountant', 'Kevin', 'James', 'how', 'get', 'noticed', 'attractive', 'wealthy', 'heiress', 'own', 'love', 'life', 'blossom', 'series', 'mishaps', 'starts', 'go', 'horribly', 'awry', 'Inevitably', 'leaving', 'Hitch', 'wondering', 'why', 'can', 'make', 'love', 'happen', 'complete', 'strangers', 'never', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'life', 'newsreporter', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'trying', 'uncover', 'true', 'identity', 'so-called', ""'Date"", 'Doctor', 'protecting', 'identity', 'so', 'long', 'Hitch', 'media', 'crosshairs', 'real', 'kicker', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'put', 'there.As', 'far', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'go', 'most', 'are', 'generally', 'predictable', 'extent', 'sometimes', 'predictability', 'types', 'films', 'lends', 'boredom', 'However', 'are', 'few', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'manage', 'be', 'predictable', 'yet', 'still', 'entertain', 'then', 'are', 'few', 'very', 'few', 'just', 'surprise', 'not', 'being', 'predictable', 'Hitch', 'somewhere', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'are', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'elements', 'are', 'crucial', 'type', 'film', 'example', 'guy', 'finds', 'girl', 'girl', 'things', 'get', 'serious', 'secret', 'guy', 'discovered', 'girl', 'girl', 'breaks', 'up', 'guy', 'guy', 'proclaims', 'love', 'girl', 'well', 'world', 'are', 'basic', 'elements', 'give', 'take', 'one', 'two', 'almost', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'days', 'Hitch', 'several', 'difference', 'was', 'lot', 'other', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'where', 'story', 'so', 'thin', 'humor', 'virtually', 'non-existent', 'find', 'already', 'knowing', 'how', 'movie', 'will', 'end', 'checking', 'eyelids', 'holes', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'due', 'boredom', 'Hitch', 'things', 'going', 'very', 'steady', 'pace', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'never', 'got', 'distracted', 'getting', 'ahead', 'story', 'remained', 'entertained', 'Probably', 'element', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'character', 'Hitch', 'had', 'taken', 'by-the-book', 'approach', 'dating', 'as', 'far', 'tips', 'go', 'worked', 'charm', 'guy', 'tutored', 'yet', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'same', 'approach', 'work', 'end', 'love', 'much', 'life', ""n't"", 'always', 'so', 'simply', 'figured', 'out.The', 'performances', 'cast', 'were', 'uniformly', 'strong', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Kevin', 'James', 'out-shined', 'everyone', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'surprising', 'given', 'comedic', 'acting', 'talents', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'was', 'very', 'endearing', 'woman', 'Hitch', 'trying', 'start', 'relationship', 'great', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'Will', 'Smith', 'made', 'couple', 'very', 'believable', 'story', 'said', 'earlier', 'contained', 'many', 'familiar', 'elements', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'yet', 'still', 'entertained', 'never', 'felt', ""'d"", 'seen', 'ending', 'what', 'expect', 'course', 'hope', 'type', 'movie', 'execution', 'ending', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'interesting', 'unique', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'probably', 'making', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'ending', 'most.With', 'being', 'said', 'Hitch', ""n't"", 'most', 'original', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'are', 'numerous', 'elements', 'are', 'unique', 'allowed', 'overlook', 'same', 'old', 'elements', 'are', 'so', 'tried', 'true', 'genre', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'plenty', 'laughter', 'feeling', 'good', 'what', 'movies', 'should', 'do', 'Hitch', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'language', 'sensuality']",N/A

Everything is thoroughly planned, as it all comes down to one moment - the first kiss.When Hitch meets his freshest client Albert (Kevin James) he senses a disaster.  The problems increase when he finds out that Albert loves Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), a famous and incredibly rich woman.  Nonetheless, Hitch believes that he can pull it off by creating a masterpiece.  Simultaneously, he meets Sara (Eva Mendes), a relentless gossip columnist, with whom he falls in love.

The biggest downfall for me in Hitch was that most of the movie's funnier moments were completely squandered by the previews (which is nothing to new in movies these days). This includes the food allergy scene, the scene were Al and Hitch kiss, and the scene where Al shows off his less than decent hip-hop dance moves to Hitch. I'm pretty sure I would have found these parts a little more amusing if I hadn't seen them in the previews on television a hundred times. But then again, movie studios aren't too worried about giving away too much in a trailer, they just need to get you into the theater and that's all they are really worried about.Also, it seemed to me in the last half hour or so, the film really lost where it was trying to go. There were a lot of other things going on plot-wise with a few different characters that made the film seem like it was trying to juggle too many things at once and having a hard time keeping pace with all of them.Other than that, the movie was just okay. There were some other scenes that were worth a chuckle or two. Probably would make a good date movie for most couples.

He stars opposite Eva Mendes who plays a jaded reporter and the two meet and become infatuated with each other at the same time as Eva is chasing down Will's client Albert who is romancing (former top model) the heiress playing the poor little rich girl.In fact this romance between Albert & his heiresss although far-fetched, is a great deal more tender and humorous than the budding relationship between Smith & Mendes.There are some classic scenes and it is all amusing, although there is not a great deal of chemistry between Smith & Mendes, nothing like the sizzling air in How to Lose a guy in 10 days with Kate Hudson & Matthew McConnaghy.If I could rate a little under 4 I would, but I can't, and it's better than 3, so girls, it's worth a look.

The only thing that makes it tolerable is that it is somewhat central to the storyline.2.  Once we get past the rather clever Cyrano De Bergerac and Pygmalion references, it goes into the realm of Prometheus in its creation of romantic relationships.

901855,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000957O7S,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 3]","The grand irony of ""Hitch"" is that it talks the talk but in the end does not walk the walk.  The best part of this 2005 romantic comedy happen when the title character, Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), a.k.a. the ""Date Doctor,"" and his newest pupil, Albert Brennaman (Kevin James) are making an effort to impress the women with whom they are smitten.  Respectively, these ladies are Sara Melas (Eva Mendes), a smart but cynical gossip columnist for a New York City tabloid, and Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), a glamorous celebrity socialite.  Nobody can get past the cold exterior that Sara has built around herself and everybody, especially the rest of the NYC celebrity set wants a piece of Allegra.Hitch decides he is interested in Sara and his opening gambits in getting her to respond are brilliant.  The script by Kevin Bisch provides a hook (at the bar) and a line (at her office) that set up a literal sinker (on the water).  More importantly, Will Smith could not be more comfortable playing a character.  Hitch is charming and he is smart, and despite a couple of problems with this first ""date,"" you have no trouble believing he is the ""Date Doctor.""  Albert is an accountant and in great need of Hitch's coaching, even to the point of needing advice whispered in his ear while having a face to face conversation with the woman he adores (try doing THAT Cyrano de Bergerac).  But when Albert first manages to get Allegra's attention, and when he manages to get her to attend a function and has to run the gauntlet of her friends, he proves himself up to the task, and the important thing is that although Hitch has set up objectives (e.g., ""shock and awe""), it is Albert who comes up with the specifics.  James's performance is almost as good as Smith's, but take into consideration that his role is harder, because he has to be both the timid accountant who needs all the help in the world and the guy who has his own charming side when he has the confidence to make it work for him.The problem with ""Hitch"" is that once director Andy Tennant has shown us that the Date Doctor is effective, both for his clients as well as in his own behalf, he decides that that he has come not to praise Hitch but to bury him.  I disagree with this diagnosis.  Hitch is not a smooth operator, which is a bad thing (a.k.a. being a pig), Hitch is just flat out smooth (I never thought I would say this, but Will Smith could be the closest thing we have to a new Cary Grant).  He is not scheming to seduce Sara, he is interested in her and capable of playing the high stakes came it takes to get her to actually take a guy seriously.  Likewise, Albert is not faking.  He has a better understanding of what it is he needs to do and why, and he makes an earnest attempt to do what needs to be done.  Neither one of them is lying when they say what they say and there is certainly nothing wrong with trying to put your best foot forward.  For that matter, knowing what that means in all of its myriad forms is not a bad thing either when you are trying to impress the woman you love.But when Hitch has his big moment of revelation and says what the script thinks is his big line, THAT is when the character tells his first lie.  Because what he says is simply not true and the proof for it is so simple: If Hitch had never talked to Albert how far would our accounting nebbish have gotten with Allegra?  For that matter, what in all honesty could Hitch have done to impress Sara given the dazzling display that we say it took from him to get her to agree to go out in the first place?  However, before the big dramatic ending ruins ""Hitch"" this is a pretty good romantic comedy with lots of smart and funny scenes, so there will be a lot of people willing to enjoy it and gloss over the hypocrisy of the final act, especially with all that cool dancing during the end credits.  But I have rarely seen a film whose self-proclaimed moral so badly missed the lesson it spent one hour and forty-five minutes developing.",4,"Ironically, the big truth of ""Hitch"" is its biggest lie",1118966400,"06 17, 2005",2005,4001,"['grand', 'irony', 'Hitch', 'talk', 'end', 'not', 'walk', 'walk', 'best', 'part', '2005', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'happen', 'when', 'title', 'character', 'Alex', 'Hitchens', 'Will', 'Smith', 'a.k.a', 'Date', 'Doctor', 'newest', 'pupil', 'Albert', 'Brennaman', 'Kevin', 'James', 'are', 'making', 'effort', 'impress', 'women', 'whom', 'are', 'smitten', 'Respectively', 'ladies', 'are', 'Sara', 'Melas', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'smart', 'cynical', 'gossip', 'columnist', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'tabloid', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'Amber', 'Valletta', 'glamorous', 'celebrity', 'socialite', 'Nobody', 'can', 'get', 'cold', 'exterior', 'Sara', 'built', 'everybody', 'especially', 'rest', 'NYC', 'celebrity', 'set', 'piece', 'Allegra.Hitch', 'interested', 'Sara', 'opening', 'gambits', 'getting', 'respond', 'are', 'brilliant', 'script', 'Kevin', 'Bisch', 'hook', 'bar', 'line', 'office', 'set', 'up', 'literal', 'sinker', 'water', 'More', 'importantly', 'Will', 'Smith', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'comfortable', 'playing', 'character', 'Hitch', 'charming', 'smart', 'couple', 'problems', 'first', 'date', 'have', 'trouble', 'believing', 'Date', 'Doctor', 'Albert', 'accountant', 'great', 'need', 'Hitch', 'coaching', 'even', 'point', 'needing', 'advice', 'whispered', 'ear', 'having', 'face', 'face', 'conversation', 'woman', 'try', 'doing', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'when', 'Albert', 'first', 'get', 'Allegra', 'attention', 'when', 'get', 'attend', 'function', 'run', 'gauntlet', 'friends', 'task', 'important', 'thing', 'Hitch', 'set', 'up', 'objectives', 'e.g.', 'shock', 'awe', 'Albert', 'who', 'up', 'specifics', 'James', 'performance', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Smith', 'take', 'consideration', 'role', 'harder', 'be', 'timid', 'accountant', 'who', 'help', 'world', 'guy', 'who', 'own', 'charming', 'side', 'when', 'confidence', 'make', 'work', 'him.The', 'problem', 'Hitch', 'once', 'director', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'shown', 'Date', 'Doctor', 'effective', 'clients', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'behalf', 'come', 'not', 'praise', 'Hitch', 'bury', 'disagree', 'diagnosis', 'Hitch', 'not', 'smooth', 'operator', 'bad', 'thing', 'a.k.a', 'being', 'pig', 'Hitch', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'smooth', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'say', 'Will', 'Smith', 'could', 'be', 'closest', 'thing', 'have', 'new', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'not', 'scheming', 'seduce', 'Sara', 'interested', 'capable', 'playing', 'high', 'stakes', 'came', 'get', 'actually', 'take', 'guy', 'seriously', 'Likewise', 'Albert', 'not', 'faking', 'better', 'understanding', 'what', 'do', 'why', 'earnest', 'attempt', 'do', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'one', 'lying', 'when', 'say', 'what', 'say', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'trying', 'put', 'best', 'foot', 'forward', 'matter', 'knowing', 'what', 'myriad', 'forms', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'when', 'are', 'trying', 'impress', 'woman', 'love.But', 'when', 'Hitch', 'big', 'moment', 'revelation', 'what', 'script', 'big', 'line', 'THAT', 'when', 'character', 'first', 'lie', 'what', 'simply', 'not', 'true', 'proof', 'so', 'simple', 'Hitch', 'had', 'never', 'talked', 'Albert', 'how', 'far', 'would', 'accounting', 'nebbish', 'have', 'gotten', 'Allegra', 'matter', 'what', 'honesty', 'could', 'Hitch', 'have', 'done', 'impress', 'Sara', 'given', 'dazzling', 'display', 'say', 'took', 'get', 'agree', 'go', 'out', 'first', 'place', 'However', 'big', 'dramatic', 'ending', 'ruins', 'Hitch', 'pretty', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'lots', 'smart', 'funny', 'scenes', 'will', 'be', 'lot', 'people', 'willing', 'enjoy', 'gloss', 'hypocrisy', 'final', 'act', 'especially', 'cool', 'dancing', 'end', 'credits', 'have', 'rarely', 'seen', 'film', 'self-proclaimed', 'moral', 'so', 'badly', 'missed', 'lesson', 'spent', 'one', 'hour', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'developing']",N/A
901856,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B000957O7S,Lawyeraau,"[24, 29]","Will Smith is a cute, funny, and charismatic actor who has charm to spare. It is, therefore, surprising that Hollywood has never before cast him as the lead in a  romantic comedy. I doubt that this oversight will occur again, as Mr. Smith takes to the genre like a duck takes to water and makes it his own. His seemingly effortless, laidback style of acting strikes pay dirt as the romantic lead in this film. I am sure that Hollywood has now taken notice that Will Smith has what it takes to be the lead in a romantic comedy.Will Smith is cast in the role of Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens, a young, suave, successful, sophisticated, smooth talker who has devised a career out of his ability to show even the most clumsy and shy, geeky guy how to get hitched to the woman of his dreams. He takes on clients whom he then  coaches in the mysteries of finding one's way into the heart of a beloved, but seemingly unattainable, woman.Our erstwhile dating consultant is hired by Albert (Kevin James),  a chubby, earnest, tongue-tied accountant, who has fallen for one of his firm's own clients, socialite-heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valleta). She is a trophy type of woman who, one would think, would not even given Albert a second look. Under Hitch's careful coaching, however, even our unlikely, lovesick accountant seems to be on the road to  true love.Of course, them that can, do, while them that can't, coach, and Hitch is no exception. While he can successfully coach his clients to attain the love of their lives, Hitch runs into a whole host of problems in his life when dealing with his own romance. It appears that he has fallen for the gorgeous Sara (Eva Mendes), a local gossip columnist. Despite his ability to ensure that the path of true love runs smoothly for others, he himself runs into many roadblocks and bumps in the road.Will Smith is simply terrific in the role of ""Hitch"", playing the role with insouciant charm. His likeability quotient can't get much higher, and he certainly infuses the role with his effortless charm and humor. Hollywood would be remiss in not casting Will Smith in other romantic comedies, as he is such an ingratiating performer that the viewer cannot help but fall in love with him.  As his love interest, Eva Mendes is certainly a gorgeous leading lady, although her character is not always likable. Still, she makes the most of her role as the feisty Sara, and I look forward to seeing her in more films.I totally enjoyed seeing Kevin James in the film. He is the star of the long-running, hit television series, ""The King of Queens"", a show that I love and wish would run forever.  I was not disappointed by his transition to the big screen, as I really enjoyed his performance. He is simply a big, cuddly, teddy bear sort of guy that you can't help but love, which helps make his on-screen pairing with Amber Valleta believable. They are simply adorable together. Amber Valleta  successfully infuses her character, Allegra Cole,  with a certain vulnerability that makes her very likable.Kudos also go to director, Andy Tennant, whose deft direction contributes to the success of this film.

I love to share a good romantic comedy with the Mrs. but unfortunately WAY too many romantic comedies are not good.  I saw the ads for ""Hitch"" back when it came into the theatres and what I saw didn't make me want to see it.The Mrs. rented it last night, and we're both glad!  Will Smith plays the title character, a high-priced consultant who turns romantic, but unskilled men into objects of desire.  An opening montage shows hapless klutzes scoring with babes and we buy that ""Hitch"" must be good at his job.  Eva Mendez is the saucy Sara, a gossip columnist who is so busy and successful at her job that she hasn't thought about romance for years.  Kevin James meets Smith's comic chops every step along the way as the chubby bumbling accountant Albert who secretly pines for his high-profile client, zillionaire heiress Allegra Cole.For a movie like this to work, there has to be a generous and believable dose of ""heart"" and ""Hitch"" has it.  The central conflict in the movie comes from the perception about the mysterious ""Date Doctor"" Hitch.  The actual character has professional morals and ethics.  He doesn't train his clients to deceive their objets d'amour, he just ""gives them opportunity"".  We meet a jerk early in the film who hires Hitch to get tricks to bed women.  How Hitch sidesteps the guy is the right mixture of heart and machismo.  Wouldn't you know that ""Mr. Wrong"" later goes out with the best friend of Hitch's romance Sara?  Certainly it makes sense that Sara the gossip columnist would be tracking every move made by Paris Hilton surrogate Allegra.  It even makes sense to question why beautiful Allegra is being seen about town with dumpy Albert.The movie is not perfect.

After bursting out of the gate big time in September 2002 with Sweet Home Alabama, the Reese Witherspoon romantic comedy which went on to gross close to one-hundred and thirty million dollars domestically, Andy Tennant, whose directorial credentials have been severely limited to a small number of lackluster features such as Ever After and Anna & the King, now helms marquee name Will Smith in a more ambitious, and therefore more highly-anticipated, film but the question still remains as to whether he truly has what it takes inside to deliver the hit film the studio needs whenever they demand it of him.The story centers on the man who thought he knew everything there is to know about getting a man to sweep the love of his life off her feet and how it had it all wrong when a cynical woman walks into his life. Alex Hitchens, also known as Hitch, has been declared the date doctor amongst his clientele within New York City by helping the desperate men who contact him to land the love of their lives. His philosophy of relationships is actually quite simple - any man can sweep any woman off her feet; he just needs the right broom. His next client is a bank accountant named Albert, who is about as clumsy and downright pathetic as a person of his age can get but still maintains a quality that makes him admirable. While he helps Albert attempt to pull off what seems like the impossible, Alex falls head over heels for a beautiful woman named Sara, a gossip columnist with a cynical view on both men, which is that they are only out for the next woman to land in bed with, and life in general. Sadly, in spite of his extensive list of past cliental success thanks to his techniques, this time around he can not seem to get his practices right around her and yet she still remains attracted to him despite this. The story for Hitch follows in the hollow footsteps of every other romantic-comedy feature that has come before its time, adhering to the same basic blueprint storyline and committing the exact sins and vices as has been accustomed for audiences, boyfriends at least, but in turn does so with such convincing style and flare that it does not become a hindrance at all. Andy Tennant, the director who also helmed the Reese Witherspoon surprise-hit, Sweet Home Alabama, has clearly acquired a knack of sorts for this particular genre, or maybe it actually is more along the lines of hand-picking the right actors, or actresses, in the lead roles that allows these films to connect with audiences so readily. In any event, Hitch's meritable message that in spite of our best intentions there are no magic formulas, potions, or specific game plans to tie down the love of our lives, if we are even aware of it at the time we meet them, and we have only to be ourselves to find acceptance makes the whole two-hours effort worth the price of admission, especially on a Valentine's Day weekend.Will Smith is positively charming, witty, and, must it be said, stylish in the role of Alex Hitchens, also known as the date doctor. The romantic-comedy genre, or comedies in general, is the precise arena in which Smith should use to his benefit his charming comedic stick as opposed to dramas of a semi-seriousness nature, I Robot being a prominent example, where it tends to throw off the flow of the storyline for its audience. Sure, there are some questions left unanswered as to how Hitch went from being a geeky lovelorn loser as he was back in college to the classy professional he is today, but its audience automatically accepts the notion that it just happened. It is after all a romantic comedy, is it not? Would you truly come to expect clear and precise logic or reason from this genre? On the other hand though, unlike films of this specific genre, there appears quite an equal balance in the amount of screen time, if not the quality of their particular scenes together or separate, between Will Smith's Alex Hitchens and Eva Mendes' Sara, of which she performs adequately well. There may be a time in the not too distant future that she could stray away from the usual eye-candy or limited comedic roles she has been reduced to over the last few years but as it works for her at the moment there are truly no complaints with her performance. As had been abundantly clear in the film's trailer leading up to its release, Kevin James, star of the CBS prime-time television series King of Queens, undoubtedly steals the spotlight, if only for a short period of time, from his fellow co-stars in Hitch, which for once is actually a fantastic quality to have seeing as how this is first major film role. Every single scene he makes an appearance in goes practically without a single misstep, or at least nothing that was noteworthy that is. Now if only lead roles, of which he will receive in the not too distant future, will be as easily accomplished as this.Overall, Hitch more then states the obvious in its observations about relationships, which is bluntly that men are bumbling idiots when it comes to love and women are nearly as clueless as they are (though certainly less commonly or explicitly), which certainly not advance within the field of love if that is what you were hoping for. But, on the more optimistic side of things, this film does conveniently provide with an opportunity to take that special someone out to catch a charming, if not often clich&eacute; filled, romantic comedy. Here is yet another example of a high-profile feature in which a fair majority of the gags found within this two-hour film are visibly present, either entirely or partially, in its trailer. The surprising quality of Hitch, as opposed to so many other projects that have fallen flat on their face in part to this horrendous marketing move, is that when these elements are placed within the proper contexts of the script they become more humorous then they had been beforehand. This helps separate this picture from the rest of the drawn-out romantic comedy pack that has plagued movie theaters the past few years. A small problem the film tends to run into occasionally, only when either the direction or the script calls for it to be this way, is that the dialogue and the actions of the characters onscreen become overtly, border-line excruciatingly, clich&eacute;d. But, when you think about seriously, is this not the curse of every romantic comedy churned out by Hollywood within the past decade, if not longer? Another fate of chick-flicks' past that this film has managed successfully to avoid is the bubble-gum pop laden soundtrack, which, though rarely addictive, happens to have worn out its inventiveness. Bottom-line, Hitch gets its point across though in the fact that through our lives we will have the fortunate opportunity to meet a wide-range of astonishing individuals who click instantly with us, many of whom we will be forced to lose at some point or another. But unless we are willing to take the risk involved and face rejection and heartache on occasion, we will never know for sure and that will be a fate worse then anything else life can throw at you. As the date-doctor himself so eloquently put it, any man can truly sweep any woman off her feet; he just needs the right broom to do it, which is whatever you want to make of it in your life.",4,The

It was funny in a lot of parts, and the actors had very good chemistry.  Then for some reason it felt the need to become a ""typical"" romantic comedy and do almost the exact opposite of what it did for the first 3/4 of the movie.  If they had stuck to that formula, I think it would have been perfect.Kevin James was the total scene stealer in the movie.  He was never afraid of making a fool of himself, and you could tell that he and Will Smith were having a lot of fun working off each other.  Eva Mendes played bitter very well.  She also showed she has very good comedic chops and was not just eye candy. It is a good date night movie.

The more I thought about the stupid, by-the-numbers script, the more I loathed it. But the extraordinary charm of the three lead actors make up for a great deal, if not for everything. Will Smith is the obvious reason why people are flocking to this film, and he's a better reason than usual for a movie like this. If there's ever been a black Cary Grant, then certainly it's Smith, with his smooth, airy yet masculine charm and seemingly effortless gift for comedy. He and his leading lady, Eva Mendes, have loads of sexy chemistry together, while as one of Smith's ""Date Doctor"" clients, Kevin James is the most lovable cinematic overweight slob since the late John Candy. (As a real-life overweight slob, I salute him.) But the script--OUCH! I cite only the most egregious example of its lameness and imbecility: toward the end of the movie, Mendes--jumping to conclusions on the flimsiest of evidence--takes actions that cause nearly irreparable harm not only to Smith, but also to James, whom she's never even met. Later on, she tells Smith, ""I never meant to hurt you."" Bullhockey! She obviously meant not only to hurt him, but to destroy both him and James utterly. Yet the mechanics of the script demand that we take her apology at face value and regard Smith as a big old meanie because he doesn't. In the absence of evidence that the scriptwriters actually thought Mendes' behavior was justifiable, I can only assume they wanted to create the obligatory complications toward Smith and Mendes getting together, and were either too lazy or too dumb to create good ones. So this movie gets three stars--one each for Smith, Mendes, and James--and absolutely none for the script.",3,"Great stars, lousy script.",1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,1817,"[""n't"", 'quite', 'accurate', 'dismiss', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'Hitch', 'just', 'silly', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'less', 'more', 'more', 'thought', 'stupid', 'by-the-numbers', 'script', 'more', 'loathed', 'extraordinary', 'charm', 'three', 'lead', 'actors', 'make', 'up', 'great', 'deal', 'not', 'everything', 'Will', 'Smith', 'obvious', 'reason', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'flocking', 'film', 'better', 'reason', 'usual', 'movie', 'ever', 'been', 'black', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'then', 'certainly', 'Smith', 'smooth', 'airy', 'yet', 'masculine', 'charm', 'seemingly', 'effortless', 'gift', 'comedy', 'leading', 'lady', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'have', 'loads', 'sexy', 'chemistry', 'together', 'one', 'Smith', 'Date', 'Doctor', 'clients', 'Kevin', 'James', 'most', 'lovable', 'cinematic', 'overweight', 'slob', 'late', 'John', 'Candy', 'real-life', 'overweight', 'slob', 'salute', 'script', 'cite', 'only', 'most', 'egregious', 'example', 'lameness', 'imbecility', 'end', 'movie', 'Mendes', 'jumping', 'conclusions', 'flimsiest', 'evidence', 'actions', 'cause', 'nearly', 'irreparable', 'harm', 'not', 'only', 'Smith', 'also', 'James', 'whom', 'never', 'even', 'met', 'Later', 'Smith', 'never', 'meant', 'hurt', 'Bullhockey', 'obviously', 'meant', 'not', 'only', 'hurt', 'destroy', 'James', 'utterly', 'mechanics', 'script', 'demand', 'take', 'apology', 'face', 'value', 'regard', 'Smith', 'big', 'old', 'meanie', ""n't"", 'absence', 'evidence', 'scriptwriters', 'actually', 'thought', 'Mendes', 'behavior', 'was', 'justifiable', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'wanted', 'create', 'obligatory', 'complications', 'Smith', 'Mendes', 'getting', 'together', 'were', 'either', 'too', 'lazy', 'too', 'dumb', 'create', 'good', 'ones', 'So', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'one', 'Smith', 'Mendes', 'James', 'absolutely', 'none', 'script']",N/A

There are definitely some quotable quotes in this movie! Will Smith is charming as Alex Hitchens who helps relationship-challenged men find happiness by showing them what to do and what not to do to sweep women off their feet. He may be a candidate for weirdest last name on film, made to fit the movie but it doesn't matter and if you think having a name like Hitchens is weird, think about the girl named Cressida! The idea of Will Smith failing to impress a woman seemed almost alien, but Will made me a believer with his portrayal of young Hitch getting dumped on by his first love.This movie makes you think the idea of a person like Hitch might be a good thing! He may be a little extreme sometimes, and maybe even irrelevant at other times, but men do need someone like him to help them, and though the movie did not acknowledge this directly, Hitch was helpful in the most important way and that was in inspiring men with the confidence they needed to go after the women they wanted! You will enjoy Hitch's charm as much as his crazy exploits in trying to capture a woman of his own. This film is original, and that alone recommends it, but if that's not enough, you have an entertaining storyline and stellar performances by the entire cast. It is pure entertainment at its best and relatively cleanest! I think there was 1 ""green verb,"" which is why I say ""relatively cleanest""!I also enjoyed the music on this film, but I think it could have been made unforgettable with a special theme song. Titanic had Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On,' Pretty Woman had Roxette's 'Must Have Been Love' and also the Roy Orbison title song, Nottinghill had Al Green's 'How Can You Mend A Broken Heart', Shrek had 'All Star,' The Sound of Music had the title song by Julie Andrews and Mary Poppins had Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! I could go on but you get the point, it just seemed like Hitch needed that one signature song to accentuate an important moment in the movement of the plot. I did enjoy the opening song and the other tracks however and the movie is fantastic so I will be ordering it on DVD.",5,Highly entertaining!

In this movie, Alex Hitchens (Smith) serves as a ""date doctor"" for men looking to impress the women they love. Alex helps men show themselves off to their best advantage during their first three dates, because he believes that the first three dates, and particularly the first kiss, become a yardstick by which women measure where a relationship is going. ""Hitch,"" as he is called, primarily tries to help (mostly bumbling) men put their best foot forward with his advice, although his specialty seems to be getting women to notice their admirers for the first time. He even helps shy accountant Albert Brennaman (James) catch the attention of famous actress Allegra Cole (Valetta).All of Hitch's advice seems to fall flat when he meets Sara Melas (Mendes), a gossip columnist for a local newspaper. After two disastrously bad dates, however, the two seem to develop a mutual liking for one another. Once Sara begins to suspect Hitch's profession, though, the relationship goes steeply downhill. It will take all of Hitch's charms, as well as a (literal) leap of faith, to find out what love really is all about.I thought this was a light, fun, predictable movie. All of the characters are likable and entertaining, particularly Kevin James as Albert Brennaman. (James does alot of cute physical comedy, and he's a very relatable character.) It would be a great date flick, and there are happy endings all around. Not much harsh language, and no sex scenes to speak of.

It is rooted in the Capitalistic-American culture, at least in my opinion.You see, it seems to me that the basic consept of this film is that anyone, anyone, can get to the top. Even if you are a fat nerd, you can go for the hottest star in Hollywood, and you have the same chance as anybody to get her.It reminds me of the Capitalistic idea that anyone can get to the top. Since I disagree with this ideal, I disagree with the basic principal of the movie.You see, although you can find some poor people that have become reach, most of the poor stay poor. It's not their fault, there is a varaity of reasons. Just the same, most nerds don't get the cutest girl around, because that's the way the world works. Only if you are on the right side of life, you have the privilige to get to the top, or to get that girl, and to think that anyone can do it, because you did.Not to mention the fact that there wasn't an avrage looking girl in the entire movie. Hollywood doesn't want you to desire the avrage. You'll go for the top, or for nothing. This I call the creation of a beuty ideal: causing both men and women to look for a certain beuty ideal, created by the media, and so, eventually, every person they choose to spend their lives with, would be a compromise.And here is the double message of this movie: on the one hand it claims anyone can get any girl. On the other hand it serves that very ideal that prevents any guy to get any girl, and vice versa.As a movie it was nice.

The film is directed by Andy Tennant and written by Kevin Bisch. Smith plays a professional matchmaker, who makes a living teaching men how to woo women. The film was released on February 11, 2005 by Columbia Pictures.Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens (Will Smith) is a professional ""date doctor"", or consultant as Hitch terms himself, who coaches other men in the art of having the perfect date with the woman of their dreams.While coaching one of his clients, Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), who is smitten with celebrity Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), Hitch finds himself falling for Sara Melas (Eva Mendes), a gossip columnist who is determined to unmask and ruin the so-called date doctor after one of his ""clients"" (with whom Hitch refused to work) had a one-night stand with her best friend. However, where Albert and Allegra's relationship continues to progress, Hitch finds that none of his tried and tested methods are working on himself, despite being a master of the art. After Hitch is unmasked, he and Sara break up, and Allegra and Albert follow suit. Finally, Hitch confronts Allegra and convinces her to reunite with Albert, before reconciling with Sara. In the process, he makes the startling discovery that he doesn't really do anything significant, and that most of his customers (particularly Albert) really were successful by just being themselves. In the end, Albert and Allegra get married and celebrate their marriage with Hitch and Sara,who are also back together again. Hitch, reflecting on love's unpredictability, addresses the audience in the last line, ""Basic principles... There are none.""The production budget was $70,000,000. Smith alleged that actress Eva Mendes, of Cuban descent, was offered the female lead because the producers were worried about the public's reaction if the part was played by a White actress (creating a potential interracial taboo) or a Black actress (creating a studio fear that two black leads would alienate the white audiences). It was believed that a Latina and a Black lead would sidestep the issue.[2] Robinne Lee's character (Cressida) was originally offered to Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai, but she could not take the role due to scheduling problems.[3] The working title of the movie was The Last First Kiss, referring to a line that Hitch delivers to Albert: ""This could be her last first kiss."" Parts of the movie were filmed in Morningside Heights, Manhattan, at Columbia University.Will Smith as Alex ""Hitch"" HitchensEva Mendes as Sara MelasKevin James as Albert BrennamanAmber Valletta as Allegra ColeJulie Ann Emery as Casey SedgewickAdam Arkin as MaxRobinne Lee as Cressida BaylorNathan Lee Graham as GeoffMichael Rapaport as BenJeffrey Donovan as Vance MunsonPaula Patton as MandyThe film received mixed to generally positive reviews, garnering a 68% ""fresh"" approval rating from notable critics, a 61% approval rating from top critics, and a 73% approval rating from users on the Rotten Tomatoes website.

Hitch tries to convince her otherwise while convincing himself that not all women are eventually evil either.The movie's greatest feature is being able to show just about every aspect or viewpoint one would have about starting a relationship, from the lovesick to the downright sick of love individuals.The writing and acting are very well done, mostly because they keep Amber's lines to a minimum.The reason for my ALMOST perfect title to this is because, toward the end, the movie gets WAY too Hallmark card-ish.

I admit, this movie started of strong, but after the 1st hour or so...it just spiralled downhill.It is about Alex Hitchens, this date doctor who basically helps big-hearted losers to get noticed by their dream girls. In his words, he creates the opportunity for them. One of these guys happens to be Albert who has a thing for Allegra, the rich and beautiful multi-millionaire. Meanwhile, Alex meets Sara who's a gossip columnist and sparks fly. What happens next? I'm sure anyone with a brain would know.I have nothing against romantic comedies. The thing with this kind of movies is the story. We all know how it's gonna end, so the writers should thrill us with the ride there. A good romantic comedy should evoke some kind of emotions. Unfortunately, even with the talented cast they have here, it's all gone to waste with a lousy and utterly predictable script. The starting 10-15 minutes was great, and I was actually looking forward to the movie. Then Will Smith gave me laughs when trying to woo Sara, played by sexy Eva Mendes. But other than this, there's nothing else that entertained me. And most of the funny scenes are actually in the movie trailer.Kevin James, who I really like in King Of Queens is underused here. And his chemistry with Allegra (played by Amber Valleta) seems kinda dead. He doesn't really seem that infatuated with her. Will Smith tries to salvage this movie for all he can, but there's just so much a guy can do. The second half of the movie really was pretty boring because of it's predictability and it seemed like I was watching a mixture of other romantic comedies (How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days and Notting Hill comes to mind).This movie might be good to watch with your partner, but even then...just rent it, it's not worth buying. This movie fails because of the script, the actors bring all they can to their roles but it just isn't enough.

Too often, Hollywood delivers a beautiful love story that can leave an audience yearning for such feelings in our own lives.  But let's face it...how many of us will find ourselves on a giant sinking ship, members of warring families, or intellectually-challenged and living in Alabama?  Hitch shows another side of romance movies...a side that's quite possibly atainible.  Think about it, how many of us meet ""the one"" at work or on the street or at one of our usual routine stops?  That's just one factor that makes this movie worth watching.  Second is it's stars.  I'll readily admit that I would have never imagined Will Smith and Kevin James teaming up (they're both actors, but their resumes suggest very different types of work.)  After seeing this film, I'll readily admit I would have never imagined the paring working out so well.  These gentlemen seemed to be acting the most natural when they were interacting with each other that I almost forgot it was a movie...in fact, could someone show me a script for those scenes so I can just make sure?  Talk about chemistry.  Will Smith plays a ""date doctor"" whose advice I could certainly use and want and Kevin James plays a love-struck and rather nerdy pencil-pusher who anyone could relate to.  Playing off these gentlemen are Eva Mendes as a gossip columnist who brings respectibility to the profession and Amber Valletta as the socialite millionaire (or billionaire...I'm not quite sure...apparently her last boyfriend owned Sweden or something like that) who has her own insecurities.  This cast tells their story against one of the finest backdrops in the world, New York City.  Really, what other city would this really work in?  The location and the cast's talents make this a truely romantic story worth watching over and over again...this time, the feelings you're left with afterwards may very well be within your grasp.  Perhaps you should listen to Mr. Smith there.  Most of advice seems to be very sound...especially the advice he gives to one sleezy gentlemen played by Jeffrey Donovan (could he show me that move?).  There's just one thing that I'm not entirely thrilled about...it doesn't lose this film a star, but it does keep me up at night.  At one point, Will Smith's character believes that his real talent is simply giving guys like Kevin James's character the confidence to get the woman of their dreams and suggests that this is no big deal in the big picture that is a subsequent relationship.  I disagree...confidence is a huge part of it and I'd certainly like a ""date doctor"" to help me out in that department...and like I said, show me that move.",4,City of Love,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,2786,"['know', 'was', 'always', 'Paris', 'held', 'title', 'City', 'Love', 'charming', 'film', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'could', 'be', 'contender', 'honor', 'Too', 'often', 'Hollywood', 'beautiful', 'love', 'story', 'can', 'leave', 'audience', 'yearning', 'such', 'feelings', 'own', 'lives', 'let', 'face', 'how', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'giant', 'sinking', 'ship', 'members', 'warring', 'families', 'intellectually-challenged', 'living', 'Alabama', 'Hitch', 'side', 'romance', 'movies', 'side', 'quite', 'possibly', 'atainible', 'Think', 'how', 'many', 'meet', 'one', 'work', 'street', 'one', 'usual', 'routine', 'stops', 'just', 'one', 'factor', 'movie', 'watching', 'Second', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'readily', 'admit', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'imagined', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Kevin', 'James', 'teaming', 'up', ""'re"", 'actors', 'resumes', 'suggest', 'very', 'different', 'types', 'work', 'seeing', 'film', ""'ll"", 'readily', 'admit', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'imagined', 'paring', 'working', 'out', 'so', 'well', 'gentlemen', 'seemed', 'be', 'acting', 'most', 'natural', 'when', 'were', 'interacting', 'other', 'almost', 'forgot', 'was', 'movie', 'fact', 'could', 'someone', 'show', 'script', 'scenes', 'so', 'can', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'Talk', 'chemistry', 'Will', 'Smith', 'plays', 'date', 'doctor', 'advice', 'could', 'certainly', 'use', 'want', 'Kevin', 'James', 'love-struck', 'rather', 'nerdy', 'pencil-pusher', 'who', 'anyone', 'could', 'relate', 'Playing', 'gentlemen', 'are', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'gossip', 'columnist', 'who', 'respectibility', 'profession', 'Amber', 'Valletta', 'socialite', 'millionaire', 'billionaire', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'apparently', 'last', 'boyfriend', 'owned', 'Sweden', 'something', 'who', 'own', 'insecurities', 'cast', 'story', 'one', 'finest', 'backdrops', 'world', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Really', 'what', 'other', 'city', 'would', 'really', 'work', 'location', 'cast', 'talents', 'make', 'truely', 'romantic', 'story', 'worth', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'time', 'feelings', ""'re"", 'left', 'afterwards', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'grasp', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'listen', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'there', 'Most', 'advice', 'be', 'very', 'sound', 'especially', 'advice', 'one', 'sleezy', 'gentlemen', 'played', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'could', 'show', 'move', 'just', 'one', 'thing', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'thrilled', ""n't"", 'lose', 'film', 'star', 'keep', 'up', 'night', 'one', 'point', 'Will', 'Smith', 'character', 'real', 'talent', 'simply', 'giving', 'guys', 'Kevin', 'James', 'character', 'confidence', 'get', 'woman', 'dreams', 'big', 'deal', 'big', 'picture', 'subsequent', 'relationship', 'disagree', 'confidence', 'huge', 'part', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'like', 'date', 'doctor', 'help', 'out', 'department', 'said', 'show', 'move']",N/A

I'm usually more into the action shoot em up types of movies not what i considered chick flicks. But to make her happy i agreed to watch it and i have got to say i was shocked because i liked it. Man watching that film made me wish i knew someone like Alex Hitchins (Smiths character) when i was trying to get my girlfriend who happened to be my dream girl. It would've helped so much.The plot of this film follows Alex Hitchins a man who was a late bloomer when it came to dating. He quickly learned social skills that helped him get any girl he wanted. He made a life choice to do it for a living helping out guys who without his extensive knowledge of women wouldn't stand much of a chance. Enter Kevin James who plays an accountant who is absolutely in love with a rich and famous girl. He went to hitch for his help. Hitch reluctantly agrees to help him thinking it was a long shot at best. In the mean time Hitch is pursuing Eva's character who is a workaholic reporter/columnist for a paper. That is a summary of the first few minutes of the film without giving up anything important or spoilers.This film is surprisingly good. It really makes you think and im sure it is a great confidence boost for guys who have issues talking to girls. I firmly believe what Will's character said ""Any guy has a chance to sweep any girl off her feet... he just needs the right broom"" I firmly believe that and this film does in subtle ways tries knock down thoughts that may be in some guys heads that a girl is too good for him. This film will have you laughing one minute and the next hoping the relationship works out.The acting is all great, Will Smith did a great job playing a guy who knows a lot about women and getting people into relationships but is afraid of relationships of his own. Eva did a great job of playing the sexy but emotionally unavailable workaholic who is falling in love with Smith. Finally Kevin did very good at being a clumsy accountant starry eyed in love.This movie wont disappoint you it is outstanding 4/5 stars.

The film does however have a marginal understanding of relationships coupled with some pretty good acting.I was surprized just how much of the movie didn't make it into the trailers. This was a completely different film than advertised. The commercials make it seem like Will Smith completely loses all face after meeting Eva Mendez, that he's reduced to a blithering idiot for the sake of comic relief. In actuality, he maintains his composure only occasionally screwing up, but he always seems to screw up in good will, making understandable mistakes.The film pays special attention to the characters' self-consciousness. It understands how hard it is for a man to start a meaningful relationship with a perfect stranger, but it also shows that women go though the same feelings. There's a great scene where Eva Mendez wakes up, expecting to find Will Smith on her couch after being treated for food allergies. Realizing he's gone, she breaks down, crying into her pillow. Of course when Hitch bursts through the door with the coffee he went out to buy, she immediately picks herself up and frantically tries to do her hair before he sees her.When watching Hitch, I couldn't help but be reminded of another film that could've gone horribly wrong, The 40-Year-Old Virgin. It's amazig just how many of the same sight gags are used in both films, in most cases, at the same point in the film. The body wax, the speed dating, the guy being involved in a potentially fatal, yet funny, car accident, the wedding/dance number. Between the two, Virgin is the superior film, but Hitch still works.The only drawbacks come from the dialog, which always sounds a little too clever to be spur of the moment, but it still conveys the brutal honesties about love.

901921,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000957O7S,Robert Moore,"[36, 41]","Until the final ten minutes of HITCH, this was one of the best romantic comedies I had seen in a long time.  The premise was fairly original, though in a way an inversion of the Cyrano de Bergerac theme.  The difference here is that instead of an ugly man capable of great love who gives voice to a less deserving, but handsome surrogate, Will Smith's Hitch is a man who is afraid of love enabling somewhat unattractive men who are capable of a great love, an opportunity to express it.  Hitch is a date doctor, someone who corrects the errors in a person's dating style that prevents his meeting the woman of his dreams.  The film revolves around two poles:  Hitch's efforts to help the hapless Albert--an overweight, clumsy accountant with bad taste and music and a hopeless dance style--woo the woman of his dreams, the socialite and heiress Allegra Cole on the one hand, and Hitch's own attempts to get to know (but not to love) Sara, a gossip columnist.  I like the way the two story lines intersect and complicate one another, so that at the end of the film Hitch ends up with not one but two disasters to correct.  Like in so many romantic comedies, the way to true happiness is paved with misunderstandings, and this is no exception.  My only problem with the movie is the way Hitch takes care of his own problems at the end of the film.  The person I saw this with hated the ending even more than I did, and she was quite upset that Sara had not taken what she considered to be the minimal steps that should have been expected for Hitch to be able to forgive her before trying to win her back.  I didn't hate the ending as much as she did, but I do agree that the final ten minutes of the film are much, much weaker than the rest of it.  On an intellectual level I understand why the decided to portray Hitch as temporarily bumbling and inarticulate, but I just couldn't buy the particular way that they pulled it off.How nice to see Will Smith in a romantic role!  And how refreshing to see Hollywood present an interracial relationship!  Granted, Eva Mendes is a dark complexioned Hispanic of Cuban descent, but it is one of the very few times we've ever seen a romance between an African American and a person of European descent.  Interracial relationships are common today, so it is nice to see Hollywood stop pretending that they don't occur.  Smith has never been funnier than in this one, and the scene in which he suffers an allergic reaction to shellfish is about as funny as I have seen in a while (the make up is exceptional in that scene).  Eva Mendes I had only scene previously in a film I absolutely detest, TRAINING DAY (as Denzel Washington's wife) and in the mess that was ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO.  She is much better served in this film, and she acquits herself admirably.  She has a feistiness and projects a confidence that I really like.  Kevin James is a stitch as Albert, and reveals himself to be one of the more physically graceful large actors to appear in some time.  Model Amber Valletta is fine as Allegra, the object of Albert's affections, but since she is quite attractive in an arm-trophy sort of way, she was perfect for the role.  Special mention must be made of Jerry Donovan, who is excellent as the reptilian Vance, who wants to hire Hitch to help him ""bang"" a girl he had met (Sara's best friend) so that he could forget about her and move on.I will confess that my own personal favorite type of film from the birth of the sound film to the present is the romantic comedy.  I wish as much effort was expended in the making of romantic comedies as in the production of movies based on comic book heroes or remakes of classics or TV shows.  That day may never come, but in the meantime I will be happy to see the occasional excellent representative of the genre such as HITCH.",5,Great romantic comedy marred by weak ending,1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,3827,"['final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'HITCH', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'had', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'premise', 'was', 'fairly', 'original', 'though', 'way', 'inversion', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'theme', 'difference', 'here', 'instead', 'ugly', 'man', 'capable', 'great', 'love', 'who', 'voice', 'less', 'deserving', 'handsome', 'surrogate', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Hitch', 'man', 'who', 'afraid', 'love', 'enabling', 'somewhat', 'unattractive', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'capable', 'great', 'love', 'opportunity', 'express', 'Hitch', 'date', 'doctor', 'someone', 'who', 'errors', 'person', 'dating', 'style', 'meeting', 'woman', 'dreams', 'film', 'around', 'two', 'poles', 'Hitch', 'efforts', 'help', 'hapless', 'Albert', 'overweight', 'clumsy', 'accountant', 'bad', 'taste', 'music', 'hopeless', 'dance', 'style', 'woo', 'woman', 'dreams', 'socialite', 'heiress', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'one', 'hand', 'Hitch', 'own', 'attempts', 'get', 'know', 'not', 'love', 'Sara', 'gossip', 'columnist', 'way', 'two', 'story', 'lines', 'intersect', 'complicate', 'one', 'end', 'film', 'Hitch', 'up', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'disasters', 'correct', 'so', 'many', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'way', 'true', 'happiness', 'paved', 'misunderstandings', 'exception', 'only', 'problem', 'movie', 'way', 'Hitch', 'care', 'own', 'problems', 'end', 'film', 'person', 'saw', 'hated', 'ending', 'even', 'more', 'did', 'was', 'quite', 'upset', 'Sara', 'had', 'not', 'taken', 'what', 'considered', 'be', 'minimal', 'steps', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'expected', 'Hitch', 'be', 'able', 'forgive', 'trying', 'win', 'back', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'ending', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'do', 'agree', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'much', 'much', 'weaker', 'rest', 'intellectual', 'level', 'understand', 'why', 'decided', 'portray', 'Hitch', 'temporarily', 'bumbling', 'inarticulate', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'particular', 'way', 'pulled', 'nice', 'see', 'Will', 'Smith', 'romantic', 'role', 'how', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'present', 'interracial', 'relationship', 'Granted', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'dark', 'complexioned', 'Hispanic', 'Cuban', 'descent', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'times', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'romance', 'African', 'American', 'person', 'European', 'descent', 'Interracial', 'relationships', 'are', 'common', 'today', 'nice', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'stop', 'pretending', 'do', ""n't"", 'occur', 'Smith', 'never', 'been', 'funnier', 'one', 'scene', 'allergic', 'reaction', 'shellfish', 'as', 'funny', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'make', 'up', 'exceptional', 'scene', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'had', 'only', 'scene', 'previously', 'film', 'absolutely', 'detest', 'TRAINING', 'DAY', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'wife', 'mess', 'was', 'ONCE', 'A', 'TIME', 'IN', 'MEXICO', 'much', 'better', 'served', 'film', 'admirably', 'feistiness', 'projects', 'confidence', 'really', 'Kevin', 'James', 'stitch', 'Albert', 'reveals', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'physically', 'graceful', 'large', 'actors', 'appear', 'time', 'Model', 'Amber', 'Valletta', 'fine', 'Allegra', 'object', 'Albert', 'affections', 'quite', 'attractive', 'arm-trophy', 'sort', 'way', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'Special', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'Jerry', 'Donovan', 'who', 'excellent', 'reptilian', 'Vance', 'who', 'hire', 'Hitch', 'help', 'bang', 'girl', 'had', 'met', 'Sara', 'best', 'friend', 'so', 'could', 'forget', 'move', 'on.I', 'will', 'confess', 'own', 'personal', 'favorite', 'type', 'film', 'birth', 'sound', 'film', 'present', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'wish', 'as', 'much', 'effort', 'was', 'expended', 'making', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'production', 'movies', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'remakes', 'classics', 'TV', 'shows', 'day', 'may', 'never', 'come', 'meantime', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'see', 'occasional', 'excellent', 'representative', 'genre', 'such', 'HITCH']",N/A

Zwick,"[1, 2]","**1/2In ""Hitch,"" Will Smith plays a modern-day Henry Higgins, who, for a tidy fee, will teach lessons of love to a bunch of lovelorn Eliza Doolittles - only, in this case, the Elizas are grown men who desperately need instruction on how to win the hearts and affections of the women of their dreams. Of course, the irony is that Hitch doesn't adhere to his own formula, being a confirmed bachelor with no interest in entering into a serious relationship with anyone himself. Until, that is, he meets the woman of his own dreams, Sara, a New York City gossip columnist who has no idea what it is Hitch does for a living.It occurs to me that, when it comes to certain movie genres - action movies and romantic comedies in particular - it would be helpful if we could inflict some kind of temporary amnesia on ourselves so that we could at least think we were watching something new and fresh and not something we've already seen a hundred times before. Even the best romantic comedies can't entirely avoid paying homage to ""the formula,"" and ""Hitch"" is clearly no exception. As such, the film has some mildly amusing moments, some endearingly sweet scenes, and some cute little plot complications amidst all the sentimental clich&eacute;s, lowbrow slapstick and tired stereotypes we generally find in these films. (I mean, do we really need yet another romantic comedy in which one of the heroine's co-worker sidekicks is a light-in-the-loafers, preposterously effeminate gay man?). It seems like every time ""Hitch"" is about to win us over, it short circuits itself and loses us by going for the obvious.Smith makes for a smooth romantic lead, but Eva Mendes doesn't always seem up to the challenge of her role, particularly when she is called upon to convey dramatic intensity. Actually, of the performers, it is Kevin James (""King of Queens""), as an overweight klutz who has hired Hitch's services to help him woo a beautiful blond heiress, who walks off with the film. Even though he's only a supporting player, it doesn't take him long to assume center stage in the film, essentially relegating the leads to second banana status.",2,so-so comedy,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,2131,"['**1/2In', 'Hitch', 'Will', 'Smith', 'modern-day', 'Henry', 'Higgins', 'who', 'tidy', 'fee', 'will', 'teach', 'lessons', 'love', 'bunch', 'lovelorn', 'Eliza', 'Doolittles', 'only', 'case', 'Elizas', 'are', 'grown', 'men', 'who', 'desperately', 'need', 'instruction', 'how', 'win', 'hearts', 'affections', 'women', 'dreams', 'course', 'irony', 'Hitch', ""n't"", 'adhere', 'own', 'formula', 'being', 'confirmed', 'bachelor', 'interest', 'entering', 'serious', 'relationship', 'anyone', 'woman', 'own', 'dreams', 'Sara', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'gossip', 'columnist', 'who', 'idea', 'what', 'Hitch', 'living.It', 'when', 'certain', 'movie', 'genres', 'action', 'movies', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'particular', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'could', 'inflict', 'kind', 'temporary', 'amnesia', 'ourselves', 'so', 'could', 'least', 'think', 'were', 'watching', 'something', 'new', 'fresh', 'not', 'something', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'hundred', 'times', 'Even', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'avoid', 'paying', 'homage', 'formula', 'Hitch', 'clearly', 'exception', 'such', 'film', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'moments', 'endearingly', 'sweet', 'scenes', 'cute', 'little', 'plot', 'complications', 'amidst', 'sentimental', 'clich', 'eacute', 'lowbrow', 'slapstick', 'tired', 'stereotypes', 'generally', 'find', 'films', 'mean', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'yet', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'one', 'heroine', 'co-worker', 'sidekicks', 'light-in-the-loafers', 'preposterously', 'effeminate', 'gay', 'man', 'time', 'Hitch', 'win', 'over', 'short', 'circuits', 'going', 'obvious.Smith', 'smooth', 'romantic', 'lead', 'Eva', 'Mendes', ""n't"", 'always', 'seem', 'up', 'challenge', 'role', 'particularly', 'when', 'called', 'convey', 'dramatic', 'intensity', 'Actually', 'performers', 'Kevin', 'James', 'King', 'Queens', 'overweight', 'klutz', 'who', 'hired', 'Hitch', 'services', 'help', 'woo', 'beautiful', 'blond', 'heiress', 'who', 'walks', 'off', 'film', 'Even', 'only', 'supporting', 'player', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'assume', 'center', 'stage', 'film', 'essentially', 'relegating', 'leads', 'second', 'banana', 'status']",N/A

Laugh out loud funny.Groundhog Day (Special 15th Anniversary Edition)has the second lesson: at least 10 years of daily practice, repetition, ritual is needed to become aware that something isn't as comfortable as it could be, experiment with different behaviors, imbed change as an adult.Third, anyone loved by family and friends recognizes how it feels to be loved without sex, so love with or without sex will find them again.In the movie, Hitch loved and was deeply hurt early in life, so he decides never to love again, but to help other dorks avoid his prior mistakes and find true love. Hitch is a paid consultant in love: new teeth, work outs (or liposuction), new hair, new clothes, new glasses, new dance steps, confidence, power tie, power suit, power car, power hand shake. The insecure like Albert (Kevin James) pay handsomely for his assistance in realizing romance.Beneath all his self assurance, Hitch believes in love and refuses to work with verbally physically emotionally spiritually abusive men. Charmingly, Hitch alludes to the tendency of men's eyes to wander even when in deeply committed relationships, as when Hitch's former roommate now brother-in-law tries to advise Hitch on love; appearance may initially attract attention but durable caring depends on authentic character and effort.Hitch advises men in their approach to the women of their dreams.Hitch falls for and is outed by gossip columnist who feels manipulated by his well practiced techniques when she discovers his profession. Hitch's prior successes dissolve. The resolution of this hilarious movie is heart warming psychobabble: anyone who can appreciate you as yourself probably loves the genuine you; if they walk away, they will always regret having lost you.The movie84 Charing Cross Road(Anthony Hopkins, Anne Bancroft) illustrates the possibility of love entirely through letters; one may nurture relationship having NEVER seen one another which explains centuries of human reproduction via arranged marriage.Hitch sees externals as first attractants only: meeting is a matter of luck (orchestrated by Hitch or your local plastic surgeon), keeping a relationship happily intact relies on the old standards: mental health, duty, responsibility, honor, fidelity, probity, commitment to doing what is right and true to the best of one's ability, being yourself. The happiest do not rely on the biggest toys, teeth, body parts; the happiest couples are conflicting mixes of extraordinary kindness, generosity, mutual caring, sacrifice devotion, shared fiscal, parenting and sexual values and effortful trying.Hitch is cinema psychotherapy ASIN:0944435556 E-Motion Picture Magic: A Movie Lover's Guide to Healing and Transformation.

Jazzy Jeff is nowhere to be found) around as the mystical Date Doctor as he helps the hapless men of New York land the girl of their dreams because as Hitch says, ""Any guy can sweep any girl off her feet, he just needs the right broom.""His latest client also stands to be his biggest triumph as a goofy account Albert, played by Kevin James hires Hitch to help catch the eye of the socialite, Allegra Cole, who is a client at his firm. But with about ten other accountants on her case, it's hard for Albert to stick out. Granted whenever Allegra's name was brought up I couldn't help wondering how much the filmmakers were getting paid from pharmaceutical industry.But Hitch's greatest success could be in trouble when he meets a jaded woman that he tries to woo who just so happens to have a gossip column that regularly focuses on Allegra's dating life. But since this is a romantic comedy, hilarity ensues instead, or at least tries too. The movie tries a little too hard at the physical which is fine when James is on screen, but when it's left up to the Fresh Prince and Eva Mendez as the gossip maven, it sometimes fall flat.Overall it was a decent movie with a couple good laughs even though most of the movie, much like every romantic comedy, was extremely predictable. There were also a few scenes that didn't really need to be in the movie like Hitch's flashback to his dorkier college days or the scene with movie killer Michael Rapaport. As for the extras on the DVD, there were a couple of run of the mil featurettes and boring deleted scenes that were rightfully left on the cutting room floor along with your typical gag reel.

This isn't an amazing Hollywood blockbuster, or trying to be some deep meaningful art piece, it is a simple fun romantic comedy and as that is all it's trying to achieve, it carries it off well.

901941,A3DY46ZABF4CMQ,B000957O7S,"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[1, 1]","From the opening scene in Hitch of Overbrook Entertainment's logo of a record playing with the song Wonderful World (Don't Know Much) by Sam Cooke in the background, and Will Smith narrating what women think of when they wake up in the morning in the opening credits, you know you're in for a really good movie.Hitch is a romantic comedy directed by Andy Tennant (Sweet Home Alabama) and starring Will Smith (Bad Boys), Eva Mendes (Out Of Time), and comedian Kevin James.Smith plays Alex Hitchens (a.k.a. Hitch), a love doctor, who helps desperate single men make the right moves and get the women of their dreams. Things start to change for Hitch when he hooks up Albert, played hilariously by Kevin James in his first major motion picture starring role, with the most famous gorgeous woman in New York, Allegra Cole, played by the pretty Amber Valletta, whom he happens to be one of the accountants for. On the other hand, Hitch begins falling for Sara, a columnist for a major New York newspaper, who is following up on a story on Allegra Cole and her unknown hubby, Albert, and one woman who thinks the love doctor is nothing but a manipulative man who tricks women but doesn't know who he is in person. I think you get the picture as to where the movie goes next.Will Smith is perfect for the role of Hitch, he's charming and has one heck of a sense of humor. Kevin James steals the show with his outwardly funny antics. Those are only two of the reasons why Hitch works.The movie is simply the best romantic comedy of the year!RecommendedA-",5,...the best romantic comedy of the year!,1136592000,"01 7, 2006",2006,1546,"['opening', 'scene', 'Hitch', 'Overbrook', 'Entertainment', 'logo', 'record', 'playing', 'song', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'Much', 'Sam', 'Cooke', 'background', 'Will', 'Smith', 'narrating', 'what', 'women', 'think', 'when', 'wake', 'up', 'morning', 'opening', 'credits', 'know', ""'re"", 'really', 'good', 'movie.Hitch', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'directed', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'starring', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'Time', 'comedian', 'Kevin', 'James.Smith', 'Alex', 'Hitchens', 'a.k.a', 'Hitch', 'love', 'doctor', 'who', 'desperate', 'single', 'men', 'make', 'right', 'moves', 'get', 'women', 'dreams', 'Things', 'start', 'change', 'Hitch', 'when', 'up', 'Albert', 'played', 'hilariously', 'Kevin', 'James', 'first', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'starring', 'role', 'most', 'famous', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'New', 'York', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'played', 'pretty', 'Amber', 'Valletta', 'whom', 'be', 'one', 'accountants', 'other', 'hand', 'Hitch', 'falling', 'Sara', 'columnist', 'major', 'New', 'York', 'newspaper', 'who', 'following', 'up', 'story', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'unknown', 'hubby', 'Albert', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'doctor', 'nothing', 'manipulative', 'man', 'who', 'women', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'person', 'think', 'get', 'picture', 'where', 'movie', 'next.Will', 'Smith', 'perfect', 'role', 'Hitch', 'charming', 'one', 'heck', 'sense', 'humor', 'Kevin', 'James', 'show', 'outwardly', 'funny', 'antics', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'reasons', 'why', 'Hitch', 'works.The', 'movie', 'simply', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'year', 'RecommendedA-']",N/A

901946,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,B000957O7S,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[8, 8]","When I first saw the trailer for ""Hitch"" back in 2004, I couldn't wait to see this movie, because this role seemed tailor made for Will Smith, and it definitely was. Smith as New York City dating consultant Alex Hitchens (aka ""Hitch"") is very much like the real Will Smith - tall, dark, handsome, suave, outgoing and humorous. This is quite a change of pace for him since Will is such a huge star of some of Hollywood's biggest action blockbusters (""Men In Black"", ""Independence Day"", ""Bad Boys"", ""I, Robot"", ""Enemy of the State""); romantic comedy isn't something he's done but he is a natural in this role. He's a coach for men looking for serious relationships, not casual flings or one night stands, but have no clue as to how to win over the women of their dreams. He's good at what he does, but only because he was once very much like his clients - ""romantically challenged"". He is able to parlay his skills into a very lucrative yet inconspicuous career for himself and he wants to keep it that way.Enter Kevin James (TV's ""King of Queens"") as Albert Brennaman - a bumbling, asthmatic accountant who is everything that Hitch is not. He is secretly in love with a rich heiress/socialite, Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta, ""What Lies Beneath"", ""Premonition""). Albert's company oversees her financial and business interests. But because Albert lacks confidence in himself, and is clumsy, overweight and shy, he thinks he has absolutely no chance in hell of getting with this woman. However, there is a quiet charm and sensitivity about Albert that you can't help but find to be appealing - like a big teddy bear that you just want to hug! He enlists the services of Hitch, who is called ""The Date Doctor"", and that's when the fun begins. Hitch teaches him the right things to say, the right things to do, and little by little, the formally inattainable Ms. Cole becomes closer to being attainable to Albert. I thought the scenes between Will and Kevin were hilarious, and they have great on-screen chemistry. Hope to see them paired up in something again in the future.However, Hitch's romantic life doesn't quite flow with the same ease that his clients have. Having his heart broken years earlier has left a lasting impression on Hitch, so he doesn't allow himself to get too close to people he's attracted to - he prefers to keep them at a safe distance. Eva Mendes (""Training Day"", ""Out Of Time"", ""Ghost Rider"") plays Sara Melas, a gossip columnist who takes her job a bit too seriously and the object of Hitch's affection, but nearly everytime they go out he does something wrong, or something embarrassing happens. I like Eva Mendes as an actress, but I found her character of Sara to be rather obnoxious at times and other than her being attractive, I couldn't understand what Hitch saw in her. I enjoyed her scenes with Hitch when she let her guard down, but for most of the film, she is difficult to like.I really enjoyed this movie up until three-quarters of the way - then the behavior of certain people started to annoy me with an incident that really wasn't that big a deal. Without revealing too much, I will just say that it was stupid for one person to place blame on someone else for a decision THEY made willingly. This incident was blown so far out of proportion that all of the main characters ended up unhappy. For that reason, I had to dock it one star. However, ""Hitch"" DOES conclude with a happy ending so it wasn't all that unpredictable. It has its flaws, but it is definitely worth watching, and one of the better romantic comedies that have been released in the past few years. This is a movie that both men and women can watch and really enjoy - it ain't just another chick flick, guys! :-) I also loved the music and being a lifelong native New Yorker, it was fun recognizing the locations where almost every scene was shot.Sidenote: There are some interesting extras on the DVD, such as deleted scenes that included Hitch's ex from college, Cressida. This explains why the actress who played her, Robinne Lee, is listed as a major member of the cast in the opening credits - however, in the final edit, her role is reduced to just appearing in Hitch's flashbacks. I'm glad they chose not to put those scenes in the theaterical release, because it would have made the film too long (like what was done with the unrated version of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" DVD). In this case, less was definitely more. :-)",4,Almost perfect,1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,4433,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Hitch', 'back', '2004', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'movie', 'role', 'seemed', 'tailor', 'made', 'Will', 'Smith', 'definitely', 'was', 'Smith', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'dating', 'consultant', 'Alex', 'Hitchens', 'Hitch', 'very', 'much', 'real', 'Will', 'Smith', 'tall', 'dark', 'handsome', 'suave', 'outgoing', 'humorous', 'quite', 'change', 'pace', 'Will', 'such', 'huge', 'star', 'Hollywood', 'biggest', 'action', 'blockbusters', 'Men', 'Black', 'Independence', 'Day', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'Robot', 'Enemy', 'State', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'something', 'done', 'natural', 'role', 'coach', 'men', 'looking', 'serious', 'relationships', 'not', 'casual', 'flings', 'one', 'night', 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'win', 'women', 'dreams', 'good', 'what', 'only', 'was', 'once', 'very', 'much', 'clients', 'romantically', 'challenged', 'able', 'parlay', 'skills', 'very', 'lucrative', 'yet', 'inconspicuous', 'career', 'keep', 'way.Enter', 'Kevin', 'James', 'TV', 'King', 'Queens', 'Albert', 'Brennaman', 'bumbling', 'asthmatic', 'accountant', 'who', 'everything', 'Hitch', 'not', 'secretly', 'love', 'rich', 'heiress/socialite', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'Amber', 'Valletta', 'What', 'Beneath', 'Premonition', 'Albert', 'company', 'financial', 'business', 'interests', 'Albert', 'confidence', 'clumsy', 'overweight', 'shy', 'absolutely', 'chance', 'hell', 'getting', 'woman', 'However', 'quiet', 'charm', 'sensitivity', 'Albert', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'find', 'be', 'appealing', 'big', 'teddy', 'bear', 'just', 'want', 'hug', 'services', 'Hitch', 'who', 'called', 'Date', 'Doctor', 'when', 'fun', 'Hitch', 'right', 'things', 'say', 'right', 'things', 'do', 'little', 'little', 'formally', 'inattainable', 'Ms.', 'Cole', 'closer', 'being', 'attainable', 'Albert', 'thought', 'scenes', 'Will', 'Kevin', 'were', 'hilarious', 'have', 'great', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'Hope', 'see', 'paired', 'up', 'something', 'again', 'future.However', 'Hitch', 'romantic', 'life', ""n't"", 'quite', 'flow', 'same', 'ease', 'clients', 'have', 'Having', 'heart', 'years', 'earlier', 'left', 'lasting', 'impression', 'Hitch', ""n't"", 'allow', 'get', 'too', 'close', 'people', 'attracted', 'keep', 'safe', 'distance', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'Training', 'Day', 'Time', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Sara', 'Melas', 'gossip', 'columnist', 'who', 'job', 'bit', 'too', 'seriously', 'object', 'Hitch', 'affection', 'nearly', 'everytime', 'go', 'out', 'something', 'wrong', 'something', 'embarrassing', 'happens', 'like', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'actress', 'found', 'character', 'Sara', 'be', 'rather', 'obnoxious', 'times', 'other', 'being', 'attractive', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'Hitch', 'saw', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'Hitch', 'when', 'let', 'guard', 'down', 'most', 'film', 'difficult', 'like.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'up', 'three-quarters', 'way', 'then', 'behavior', 'certain', 'people', 'started', 'annoy', 'incident', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'big', 'deal', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'was', 'stupid', 'one', 'person', 'place', 'blame', 'someone', 'else', 'decision', 'THEY', 'made', 'willingly', 'incident', 'was', 'blown', 'so', 'far', 'proportion', 'main', 'characters', 'ended', 'up', 'unhappy', 'reason', 'had', 'dock', 'one', 'star', 'However', 'Hitch', 'DOES', 'conclude', 'happy', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'unpredictable', 'flaws', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'better', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'movie', 'men', 'women', 'can', 'watch', 'really', 'enjoy', 'ai', ""n't"", 'just', 'chick', 'flick', 'guys', 'also', 'loved', 'music', 'being', 'lifelong', 'native', 'New', 'Yorker', 'was', 'fun', 'recognizing', 'locations', 'where', 'almost', 'scene', 'was', 'shot.Sidenote', 'are', 'interesting', 'extras', 'DVD', 'such', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'included', 'Hitch', 'ex', 'college', 'Cressida', 'why', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Robinne', 'Lee', 'listed', 'major', 'member', 'cast', 'opening', 'credits', 'however', 'final', 'edit', 'role', 'reduced', 'just', 'appearing', 'Hitch', 'flashbacks', ""'m"", 'glad', 'chose', 'not', 'put', 'scenes', 'theaterical', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'unrated', 'version', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'DVD', 'case', 'was', 'definitely', 'more']",N/A

There are many moments where you'll be shaking your head and saying ""O gosh, I've done that!"" or ""Man, guys have done that to me before!"" Will Smith and Kevin James are immediately likable as contrasted characters who become buddies. Will wins us with his too-cool act and perfectly delivered one-liners. Kevin is so endearing with his sincere adoration and brilliant comedic facial expressions and line delivery.

901951,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000957O7S,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 6]","""Hitch"" (Will Smith) is a professional date doctor. He helps men get through the nervousness they experience when they are pursuing the woman of their dreams. His latest client, Albert (Kevin James, TV's ""The King of Queens""), a portly CPA, is smitten with Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), an heiress whose every romance is plastered across the tabloids. Hitch agrees to take Albert on as a client, because he likes the challenge. Also pursuing Allegra Cole is Sara (Eva Mendes), the star reporter for one of those tabloids. Hitch spots her in a crowded bar one night and strikes up a conversation. Hitch and Sara's dates are disasters, but they agree to keep trying. As Albert becomes closer to Allegra, Hitch is still trying to pursue Sara, as she tries to pursue the elusive Albert.""Hitch"", released rather fortuitously the Friday before Valentine's Day, broke a number of box office records it's opening weekend. This shouldn't be a surprise. Everything about the film is designed to make women go `aaaah, Will Smith is so cute.'The film is a pleasant diversion, but it only works sporadically. The film is at it's best when the story centers on Albert, the Kevin James character. He has a couple of scenes of inspired comedy, which surely must have been adlibbed. One scene, in which he demonstrates to Hitch how he would dance is the funniest thing I have seen in some time. Another nice touch to Albert's character is that although he is portly, this isn't necessarily the cause of his nervousness. He's just nervous around women. It doesn't help that he is pursuing one of the most beautiful socialites in New York, but it's nice to see a big guy portrayed in a film that isn't a slob or completely useless.Unfortunately, there is also the part of the film that concentrates on Hitch's relationship with Sara. I guess the filmmakers felt that they needed something a little more grounded to balance out the film. Smith and Mendes are certainly likable enough as actors, and their first date is slightly amusing. But this is the relationship in the film where nothing works. They get in fights, have miscommunication, have bad feelings, in others words, like a real life courtship. I'm sorry, but I don't want to see Will Smith, in a comedy, in a relationship attempting to be real life. It brings the entire film down. This story line might have been more successful but there is also a lack of chemistry between them. They don't kiss until the end, and by that point, we have sat through about 60 minutes of this. It's too little, too late.The funniest bit with Smith is the very beginning of the film as we eavesdrop on him working with three clients. Its fun to watch how he helps them win the ladies of their dreams.The technical aspect of the film is okay. The fairly straight forward approach works for the story. Everyone lives in a great apartment in New York City, enjoys going out all the time and are basically burning up the town. They must all make a lot of money. What ""Hitch"" does well is provide a very nice portrait of New York City. It looks like a fun place to live.Too bad the film doesn't provide as much enjoyment as living in New York seems to for these characters.",3,A Little Hitch In His Get Along,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,3194,"['Hitch', 'Will', 'Smith', 'professional', 'date', 'doctor', 'men', 'get', 'nervousness', 'experience', 'when', 'are', 'pursuing', 'woman', 'dreams', 'latest', 'client', 'Albert', 'Kevin', 'James', 'TV', 'King', 'Queens', 'portly', 'CPA', 'smitten', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'Amber', 'Valletta', 'heiress', 'romance', 'plastered', 'tabloids', 'Hitch', 'take', 'Albert', 'client', 'challenge', 'Also', 'pursuing', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'Sara', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'star', 'reporter', 'one', 'tabloids', 'Hitch', 'spots', 'crowded', 'bar', 'one', 'night', 'up', 'conversation', 'Hitch', 'Sara', 'dates', 'are', 'disasters', 'agree', 'keep', 'trying', 'Albert', 'closer', 'Allegra', 'Hitch', 'still', 'trying', 'pursue', 'Sara', 'pursue', 'elusive', 'Albert', 'Hitch', 'released', 'rather', 'fortuitously', 'Friday', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'broke', 'number', 'box', 'office', 'records', 'opening', 'weekend', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprise', 'Everything', 'film', 'designed', 'make', 'women', 'go', 'aaaah', 'Will', 'Smith', 'so', 'cute', 'film', 'pleasant', 'diversion', 'only', 'sporadically', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'story', 'centers', 'Albert', 'Kevin', 'James', 'character', 'couple', 'scenes', 'inspired', 'comedy', 'surely', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'adlibbed', 'One', 'scene', 'Hitch', 'how', 'would', 'dance', 'funniest', 'thing', 'have', 'seen', 'time', 'nice', 'touch', 'Albert', 'character', 'portly', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'cause', 'nervousness', 'just', 'nervous', 'women', ""n't"", 'help', 'pursuing', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'socialites', 'New', 'York', 'nice', 'see', 'big', 'guy', 'portrayed', 'film', ""n't"", 'slob', 'completely', 'useless.Unfortunately', 'also', 'part', 'film', 'Hitch', 'relationship', 'Sara', 'guess', 'filmmakers', 'felt', 'needed', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'grounded', 'balance', 'out', 'film', 'Smith', 'Mendes', 'are', 'certainly', 'likable', 'enough', 'actors', 'first', 'date', 'slightly', 'amusing', 'relationship', 'film', 'where', 'nothing', 'get', 'fights', 'have', 'miscommunication', 'have', 'bad', 'feelings', 'others', 'words', 'real', 'life', 'courtship', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Will', 'Smith', 'comedy', 'relationship', 'attempting', 'be', 'real', 'life', 'entire', 'film', 'down', 'story', 'line', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'successful', 'also', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'do', ""n't"", 'kiss', 'end', 'point', 'have', 'sat', '60', 'minutes', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late.The', 'funniest', 'bit', 'Smith', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'eavesdrop', 'working', 'three', 'clients', 'fun', 'watch', 'how', 'win', 'ladies', 'dreams.The', 'technical', 'aspect', 'film', 'okay', 'fairly', 'straight', 'forward', 'approach', 'story', 'Everyone', 'great', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'going', 'time', 'are', 'basically', 'burning', 'up', 'town', 'must', 'make', 'lot', 'money', 'What', 'Hitch', 'well', 'provide', 'very', 'nice', 'portrait', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'fun', 'place', 'live.Too', 'bad', 'film', ""n't"", 'provide', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'characters']",N/A

He gets his most difficult job ever when Albert (Kevin James) wants a supermodel!

Will Smith is Alex Hitchens, ""date doctor"" who gives tips for males to arrange the dates with the opposite sex.  And believe it or not, every ""client"" is satisfied with his job.The film has two stories, both of which are not particularly original, but told with a delightful touch and considerable energy.  In one, Alex himself falls in love with a gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes), who strictly guards herself against unwelcome males coming to her.  But of course, Alex is an exception -- his persistent wooing (even using walkie-talkie)is so irreisitible.In the other, we find more unique story and talents -- Alex is given a hard task, as hard as Mission Impossible.  That is, to guide one accountant Albert (Kevin James) successfully to his goal -- a date with a celebrity, beautiful and (very) rich female Allegra (Amber Valletta).  The big problem is, Albert, so smitten, so good-natured, so timid, cannot do one single right thing even while having a lunch, kind of a guy who drops fried potatoes onto the floor, and kicks a can of coke while picking up them.  It seems Albert (and a terrible dancer too) is totally a hopeless case, but Alex Hitchens knows what to do.The direction of Andy Tennant ('Ever After') is a strange mixture of slapsticks, witty dialogues, and romantic mood.  The tone is inconsistent, but that doesn't bother us.  The story is predictable, and the ending is very weak, but still the characters, or the actors, are all charming.  And very funny and likable Kevin James as Albert steals almost every scene in the film.Probably, however, the best part of the film is the location itself, well-chosen spots in New York City.  A bit familiar as romantic comedy perhaps, but very cute 'Hitch' with equally cute characters reminds us that this city is and will be a beloved place for every film lover.",4,"Familiar, But Cute and Delightful Romantic Comedy in NYC",1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,1959,"['Scene', 'One', 'Will', 'Smith', 'easygoing', 'charms', 'directly', 'talks', 'viewers', 'know', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Alex', 'Hitchens', 'date', 'doctor', 'who', 'tips', 'males', 'arrange', 'dates', 'opposite', 'sex', 'believe', 'not', 'client', 'satisfied', 'job.The', 'film', 'two', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'original', 'told', 'delightful', 'touch', 'considerable', 'energy', 'one', 'Alex', 'love', 'gossip', 'columnist', 'Sara', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'who', 'strictly', 'unwelcome', 'males', 'coming', 'course', 'Alex', 'exception', 'persistent', 'wooing', 'even', 'using', 'walkie-talkie', 'so', 'irreisitible.In', 'other', 'find', 'more', 'unique', 'story', 'talents', 'Alex', 'given', 'hard', 'task', 'as', 'hard', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'guide', 'one', 'accountant', 'Albert', 'Kevin', 'James', 'successfully', 'goal', 'date', 'celebrity', 'beautiful', 'very', 'rich', 'female', 'Allegra', 'Amber', 'Valletta', 'big', 'problem', 'Albert', 'so', 'smitten', 'so', 'good-natured', 'so', 'timid', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'one', 'single', 'right', 'thing', 'even', 'having', 'lunch', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'fried', 'potatoes', 'floor', 'can', 'coke', 'picking', 'up', 'Albert', 'terrible', 'dancer', 'too', 'totally', 'hopeless', 'case', 'Alex', 'Hitchens', 'what', 'do.The', 'direction', 'Andy', 'Tennant', ""'Ever"", 'strange', 'mixture', 'slapsticks', 'witty', 'dialogues', 'romantic', 'mood', 'tone', 'inconsistent', ""n't"", 'bother', 'story', 'predictable', 'ending', 'very', 'weak', 'still', 'characters', 'actors', 'are', 'charming', 'very', 'funny', 'likable', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Albert', 'steals', 'almost', 'scene', 'film.Probably', 'however', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'location', 'well-chosen', 'spots', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'A', 'bit', 'familiar', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'perhaps', 'very', 'cute', ""'Hitch"", 'equally', 'cute', 'characters', 'city', 'will', 'be', 'beloved', 'place', 'film', 'lover']",N/A

Hitch helps average guys gain the attention and win the hearts of the women of their dreams.  He has a strict code that he follows and his identity has remained a secret.Hitch is hired by a tax accountant named Albert (Kevin James).  Albert is an overweight, average-Joe who happens to work at a firm that handles starlet Allegra Cole's (Amber Valleta) accounts.  Allegra Cole is a celebrity and has all the money, fame, power, and beauty that comes with her station.  Albert falls deeply in love with Ms. Cole and needs help getting her attention.  This is a romantic comedy, so even the most improbable scenarios become likely and soon Albert finds himself dating the famous Allegra Cole.Meanwhile, Hitch has some problems of his own.  He's fallen for a national gossip columnist, Sara (Eva Mendes) who is trying to figure out who the unknown man Allegra Cole has been seen with really is.  Hitch is a true genius at setting up scenarios for his clients, but all of the tricks he uses to help his clients have the opposite effect when he uses them with Sara.  For example, A romantic trip to Ellis Island turns Sara into a raging and crying fury of hatred and a night at a make-your-own seafood place has Hitch breaking out in a serious facial reaction.  As Hitch and Sara bond with each other, their relationship becomes increasingly rocky when a spurned client turns on Hitch and Sara learns what he really does for a living.The poster and DVD cover for HITCH say that ""Will Smith is `Hitch'"".  There's no better way to explain it because Smith is Hitch.  Every gesture, move, and spoken phrase seems perfect.  Hitch is a role that Smith was born to play.  But Smith doesn't shine alone in the film.  Eva Mendes is a beautiful woman, but she's also incredibly talented.  She holds her own against one of Hollywood's most powerful actors.  From various interviews she has given, Mendes seems like a down-to-Earth person.  That reality grounds Sara and radiates through her and makes her someone that the audience cares for.  Kevin James does an excellent job as the film's pivotal-plot character Albert and in many scenes upstages Smith.I tend to like most genres of movies as long as there is a good story involved.  However, romantic comedies are my least favorite film genre.  Many romantic comedies made are trite and have no originality to them.  HITCH really isn't like that.  The movie has a good story, great actors, and solid direction.  It's both funny and tender.  Unlike many movies in he genre, HITCH is a movie that a person can enjoy watching by themselves just as much as watching it with a loved one.Recommended for fans of romantic comedies, fans of Will Smith, fans of Eva Mendes, and fans of Kevin James.  For movie trivia fans, the fire station shown at the beginning of the movie as Hitch is helping a client is the same firehouse used in GHOSTBUSTERS.",4,Will Smith Shines,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,3075,"['Displaying', 'can', 'handle', 'lead', 'role', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'just', 'as', 'easily', 'can', 'handle', 'other', 'genre', 'field', 'Will', 'Smith', 'shines', 'HITCH', 'Alex', 'Hitchens', 'Date', 'Doctor', 'Hitch', 'average', 'guys', 'gain', 'attention', 'win', 'hearts', 'women', 'dreams', 'strict', 'code', 'identity', 'remained', 'secret.Hitch', 'hired', 'tax', 'accountant', 'named', 'Albert', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Albert', 'overweight', 'average-Joe', 'who', 'work', 'firm', 'starlet', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'Amber', 'Valleta', 'accounts', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'celebrity', 'money', 'fame', 'power', 'beauty', 'station', 'Albert', 'deeply', 'love', 'Ms.', 'Cole', 'needs', 'help', 'getting', 'attention', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'so', 'even', 'most', 'improbable', 'scenarios', 'become', 'likely', 'soon', 'Albert', 'dating', 'famous', 'Allegra', 'Cole.Meanwhile', 'Hitch', 'problems', 'own', 'fallen', 'national', 'gossip', 'columnist', 'Sara', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'who', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'unknown', 'man', 'Allegra', 'Cole', 'been', 'seen', 'really', 'Hitch', 'true', 'genius', 'setting', 'up', 'scenarios', 'clients', 'tricks', 'help', 'clients', 'have', 'opposite', 'effect', 'when', 'Sara', 'example', 'A', 'romantic', 'trip', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'Sara', 'raging', 'crying', 'fury', 'hatred', 'night', 'make-your-own', 'seafood', 'place', 'Hitch', 'breaking', 'out', 'serious', 'facial', 'reaction', 'Hitch', 'Sara', 'bond', 'other', 'relationship', 'increasingly', 'rocky', 'when', 'spurned', 'client', 'Hitch', 'Sara', 'what', 'really', 'living.The', 'poster', 'DVD', 'cover', 'HITCH', 'say', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Hitch', 'better', 'way', 'explain', 'Smith', 'Hitch', 'Every', 'gesture', 'move', 'spoken', 'phrase', 'perfect', 'Hitch', 'role', 'Smith', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'Smith', ""n't"", 'shine', 'alone', 'film', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'also', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'own', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'powerful', 'actors', 'various', 'interviews', 'given', 'Mendes', 'down-to-Earth', 'person', 'reality', 'Sara', 'someone', 'audience', 'cares', 'Kevin', 'James', 'excellent', 'job', 'film', 'pivotal-plot', 'character', 'Albert', 'many', 'scenes', 'upstages', 'Smith.I', 'tend', 'like', 'most', 'genres', 'movies', 'as', 'long', 'good', 'story', 'involved', 'However', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'least', 'favorite', 'film', 'genre', 'Many', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'made', 'are', 'trite', 'have', 'originality', 'HITCH', 'really', ""n't"", 'movie', 'good', 'story', 'great', 'actors', 'solid', 'direction', 'funny', 'tender', 'many', 'movies', 'genre', 'HITCH', 'movie', 'person', 'can', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'watching', 'loved', 'one.Recommended', 'fans', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'fans', 'Will', 'Smith', 'fans', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'fans', 'Kevin', 'James', 'movie', 'trivia', 'fans', 'fire', 'station', 'shown', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Hitch', 'helping', 'client', 'same', 'firehouse', 'used', 'GHOSTBUSTERS']",N/A

There were some very funny moments in the movie, some very touching moments, and some scenes very unpredictable.  I liked that this movie didn't have a lot of crude humor/nudity and was a cleaner cut movie.Kevin James did a great job as his role in this movie as an accountant in love with a celebrity and their courtship.

901961,A3Q7DPS8UFNTRG,B000957O7S,Venus A. Rachal,"[1, 3]","This movie has style and though the plot is predictable, the characters are engaging and believable. Will Smith is ultra-smooth as Alex Hitchens, a ""date doctor"" who mentors nerdy-type men into mastering their first 3 dates with the women of their dreams. He is coaching Al Breneman, a clumsy, kind, and completely desperate accountant who has fallen in love with New York's number one socialite, Allegra Cole.Honestly, Kevin James is fabulous in this movie as Al. His relationship with Allegra is occassionally more engaging than even the feature romance between Hitch and Sara. Most of the funny parts in the movie belong to Al as whenever Hitch and Al are together, Hitch has to play the ""straight-man"". It's only when Hitch is around Sara (played by Eva Mendez) that he looses his cool.The dialogue is well executed. There is a great scene when Hitch first meets Sara in a bar after Sara has dismissed a guy who tries to pick her up. Instantly, Hitch realizes that he must step up his game and approach Sara from an entirely different angle. Because the dialogue is so witty and fresh, the movie comes off easily.This is not a hard movie to watch by any means. Instead of watching cookie cutter characters which are sometimes common in romantic comedies, we get real people who have different perspectives on love and relationships. While they ultimately must serve the overlying function of the romance, we never get the impression that Hitch, Sara, Al, and Allegra are acting the way that they are in order to get to the end of the movie.All in all, this was funny, original, and great to watch. It's a good movie to add to your collection because you won't get bored watching it a second time.",5,Refreshing and funny!,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,1700,"['movie', 'style', 'plot', 'predictable', 'characters', 'are', 'engaging', 'believable', 'Will', 'Smith', 'ultra-smooth', 'Alex', 'Hitchens', 'date', 'doctor', 'who', 'mentors', 'nerdy-type', 'men', 'mastering', 'first', '3', 'dates', 'women', 'dreams', 'coaching', 'Al', 'Breneman', 'clumsy', 'kind', 'completely', 'desperate', 'accountant', 'who', 'fallen', 'love', 'New', 'York', 'number', 'one', 'socialite', 'Allegra', 'Cole.Honestly', 'Kevin', 'James', 'fabulous', 'movie', 'Al', 'relationship', 'Allegra', 'occassionally', 'more', 'engaging', 'even', 'feature', 'romance', 'Hitch', 'Sara', 'Most', 'funny', 'parts', 'movie', 'belong', 'Al', 'whenever', 'Hitch', 'Al', 'are', 'together', 'Hitch', 'play', 'straight-man', 'only', 'when', 'Hitch', 'Sara', 'played', 'Eva', 'Mendez', 'cool.The', 'dialogue', 'well', 'executed', 'great', 'scene', 'when', 'Hitch', 'first', 'Sara', 'bar', 'Sara', 'dismissed', 'guy', 'who', 'pick', 'up', 'Instantly', 'Hitch', 'must', 'step', 'up', 'game', 'approach', 'Sara', 'entirely', 'different', 'angle', 'dialogue', 'so', 'witty', 'fresh', 'movie', 'easily.This', 'not', 'hard', 'movie', 'watch', 'means', 'Instead', 'watching', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'characters', 'are', 'sometimes', 'common', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'get', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'different', 'perspectives', 'love', 'relationships', 'ultimately', 'must', 'serve', 'overlying', 'function', 'romance', 'never', 'get', 'impression', 'Hitch', 'Sara', 'Al', 'Allegra', 'are', 'acting', 'way', 'are', 'order', 'get', 'end', 'movie.All', 'was', 'funny', 'original', 'great', 'watch', 'good', 'movie', 'add', 'collection', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'watching', 'second', 'time']",N/A

Writing a nasty review of it would be like finding a piece of cardboard on the street and writing your congressman about it. There is nothing relevant to say, as far as I can find. It wasn't interesting enough to be bad - it had all the daring dialogue of a yoplait commercial, without the interactivity (SHOULD I buy the yogurt? Should I not?). Will Smith smirked, some fat white guy couldn't dance, and some chick was hard to get. What a waste of film - what a waste of people - what a waste of life! Don't people have better things to do with their time than slurp garbage like this down their gullets? If you're going to go to all the trouble of setting up a film crew and hiring actors, if you're going to haul all these slobs into the movie theatre to sit in the dark, letting your pictures flicker across their slackened faces, why don't you at least try to say SOMETHING? ANYTHING - c'mon. Give me charging buffaloes, or an impassioned speech about the misery of lower back pain. SOMETHING. Not this - this is nothing. This is the kind of movie that no one will remember seeing in 6 months. Sure, sure, it's full of all kinds of awful presuppositions, but I don't even think the director is aware of those, so there's no sense in smacking him for it.

He's found out by a member of the target sex (hetero, so that means ladies here), and bad things and happy endings follow. OK, I'm hapy ignoring that 70%.The 30% that includes raw physical humor hurt me laughing. Will Smith is as usual, suave, in control, and as silly as he needs to be. Eva Mendez ('Sara') is pretty and earnest.Kevin James - Albert - walks away with the show in his pocket. He's a bit tubby (and knows it), and an utterly inept geek. He does a lot in this movie, all good, but it's his physical humor that grabs the show and drags it home behind him. He has mastered the prat-fall, the no-pants scene, the embarassing dance, and the million other daily experiences of the human male. What's worse is that he shows them, and worse yet is that every guy in the room crosses his legs and thinks ""my god I hoped no one saw when I did that.""But it works. It features Smith in some self-important mugging (c'mon guys, did your date ever get you onto the front page? or even the police blotter?)
