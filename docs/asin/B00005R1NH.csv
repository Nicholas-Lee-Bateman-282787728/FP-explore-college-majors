One such connection is that Mary Lincoln set out to create a higher standard of elegance for the rather shabby White House at that time. Although she characteristically went way over budget, most commentators praised her good taste. Apparently prior wives were more inhibited by the mores of the time to effect any domestic changes in the Presidencial abode. As an aside note, Mary Todd Lincoln was the first wife to be called ""First Lady."" Jackie Kennedy's elegance & style not only won over masses of Americans, she impressed & wowed much of the world. I remember that when the Kennedy's went on a State tour of South America, many people on the street held up placards with the slogan ""JACKIE SI, JACK NO!""Unfortunately Mary Todd Lincoln was much less fortunate. The documentary clearly indicates that she probably suffered from a dysfunctional combo of Manic-Depression & Obsesskive Compulsive disorder. When her favorite son Willie died, she brought mediums into the White house in a sad attempt to reestablish some sort of communication with him (so-called ""psychics"" have much to answer for then--and now.) Where Jackie O. was adulated, Mary Todd was almost universally vivilified. The Press saw a vulnerable target & went for it.However, in one segment of the documentary we discover that Mary Lincoln formed a close relationship with a ""freed slave"" woman--who just happened to have worked for Confederate First Lady Mrs. Jefferson Davis. This woman had also lost a son & Mary Lincoln identified with & trusted her. In was through this relationship of kindred souls that Mary became involved with the abolitionist movement much more intimately than her husband ever did. African-American commentators in the film elaborate on this & many other pivotal points.In regards to Lincoln himself, A HOUSE DIVIDED masterfully presents the figure of a man with enormous depth of character & concern. Although a principled abolitionist, Lincoln may not may not have been the total intergrationist one would hope, but his moral stand was sincere & the best that could be hoped for in the milieu in which he lived. He was a man of integrity, forced by fate to participate in a horrendous war that was pulling a new nation apart. The cause of the North was just, but that didn't erase the bloody consequences of the cause. A soulful man, the conequences of the war were devastating on Lincoiln. Some said that he almost resembled a corpse. Nonetheless, his ungainly appearance was trumped by a principled moral conviction far above his race or time.

We get side by side biographies of both Lincoln and Mary.  Both of these biographies are then put into context of their socieites and the politics and ultimately the war that had an impact on everyone's life and broken families... Just when things seem to be settling down, there is a visit from Mary's confederate half sister.The pace is methodical, which some might find slow, but it has a real payoff in the moments when we can really savor the richness of Lincoln's words and the choices he makes in the moment.  Holly Hunter was a really poor choice for Mary's voice, her lateral lisp is too distracting for voiceover work, and her choice of breathy delivery was off putting.  She's a good actress, just a poor choice for voiceover work, and especially for this role.  A ""name"" is not always a good solution for a difficult voice casting choice.  David McCullough's narration is seamless, as usual, Mr. Morse as the voice of Lincoln really fit perfectly - his voice seemed to be Lincoln and it was ""unnoticable"" and that is great vocal casting.The variety of historians is a great window - from the Mary Lincoln historian who breathlessly relates Mary's side of things, to the writer who talks about Lincoln's choices as a writer, to the African American historians, one who thinks Lincoln didn't do enough, the other who appreciates that Lincoln evolved and had a good sense of how much and where he could push.An excellent series, it would make an excellent gift for repeated viewings.",5,Marital Biography,1250035200,"08 12, 2009",2009,1550,"['excellent', 'program', 'really', 'two', 'biographies', 'one', 'get', 'side', 'side', 'biographies', 'Lincoln', 'Mary', 'biographies', 'are', 'then', 'put', 'context', 'socieites', 'politics', 'ultimately', 'war', 'had', 'impact', 'everyone', 'life', 'broken', 'families', 'Just', 'when', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'settling', 'down', 'visit', 'Mary', 'confederate', 'half', 'sister.The', 'pace', 'methodical', 'might', 'find', 'slow', 'real', 'payoff', 'moments', 'when', 'can', 'really', 'savor', 'richness', 'Lincoln', 'words', 'choices', 'moment', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'was', 'really', 'poor', 'choice', 'Mary', 'voice', 'lateral', 'lisp', 'too', 'distracting', 'voiceover', 'work', 'choice', 'breathy', 'delivery', 'was', 'off', 'putting', 'good', 'actress', 'just', 'poor', 'choice', 'voiceover', 'work', 'especially', 'role', 'name', 'not', 'always', 'good', 'solution', 'difficult', 'voice', 'casting', 'choice', 'David', 'McCullough', 'narration', 'seamless', 'usual', 'Mr.', 'Morse', 'voice', 'Lincoln', 'really', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'voice', 'seemed', 'be', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'unnoticable', 'great', 'vocal', 'casting.The', 'variety', 'historians', 'great', 'window', 'Mary', 'Lincoln', 'historian', 'who', 'breathlessly', 'Mary', 'side', 'things', 'writer', 'who', 'Lincoln', 'choices', 'writer', 'African', 'American', 'historians', 'one', 'who', 'Lincoln', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'enough', 'other', 'who', 'Lincoln', 'evolved', 'had', 'good', 'sense', 'how', 'much', 'where', 'could', 'push.An', 'excellent', 'series', 'would', 'make', 'excellent', 'gift', 'repeated', 'viewings']",N/A

Bernabo,"[16, 18]","During the pivotal Presidential election of 1860, three of the four major candidates running for the White House had once courted Mary Todd.  The story of how this young woman spurned Stephen Douglass and John Breckenridge in favor of Abraham Lincoln has always been a fascinating tale.  The fact that this same woman ended up committed for insanity after her fragile emotions failed to survive the deaths of her husband and three of her four sons.  The title of David Grubin's film, as well as the first episode, traces the parallel courses of the future couple.  Both lost their mothers when young and had completely opposite reactions to their stepmothers.  More importantly, when they found each other they were able to recognition they shared the same ambition and this most improbably couple made their way to the White House at the most pivotal moment in the nation's history.Of course it is history that overwhelms the story Grubin sets off to tell.  For the last two thirds of &quot;A House Divided,&quot; basically from the start of the Civil War until the assassination of Lincoln, Mary becomes a minor character.  However, given the essentially balanced nature of the first couple of episodes, this shift becomes somewhat disconcerting.  Eventually I adjusted to this shift, having recognized that the Civil War certainly put Lincoln's marriage on the back burner, but I think Grubin could have cut two hours from this series, whittling down the recapitulation of basic Civil War history to keep the focus on the increasingly unhappy couple.  After all, that is the hook that is used to reel us into watching this documentary, which originally aired on PBS's &quot;American Experience.&quot;Each of the three-videotapes in this series contains two episodes.  Comparisons with Ken Burns's landmark &quot;Civil War&quot; series are inevitable not only because of the subject matter but because David McCullough again does the narration as the unofficial voice of the Civil War.  There are certainly some stylistic differences, which result in some melodramatic moments in this series, which begins with a storm night and children whispering about the crazy lady living in the room over the parlor of that Springfield house.  Civil War battles are a conglomerate of black &amp; white period photos and firework explosions.  You will recognize Holly Hunter as the voice of Mary Lincoln right away, but might be surprised to learn that David Morse is doing Abraham Lincoln (I know I was).

And what's more...I have never fallen out"".//quote Abraham LincolnThere are generally two schools of thought on the Lincoln marriage. The first are historians, scholars and regular Lincolnites who insist that the marriage was a living hell for Abe Lincoln, one that pretty much destroyed his emotional life. I call this The Herndon School.Then there is a more recent approach. It was a difficult, stormy, even dysfunctional relationship, but these two people did indeed love one another. And if Mary was not the depraved witch who Lincoln married under duress, neither was Abe always some long suffering saint who bore his cross with patience.What is baffling is that people who insist the marriage was loveless are ignoring the words straight from the horse's mouth. Abraham Lincoln himself. He fell in love, he remained in love.This informative, heartbreaking series explains the ""hows"" and ""whys"" of how these two vastly different people came together, made a family, and achieved a goal together...only to see their great triumph ultimately destroy their family and ruin their lives. Because that is exactly what the Presidency did. Starting with the death of the much loved Willie, and Mary's subsequent emotional breakdown(the death of this favorite child of both herself and Abraham was the beginning of the end for her),the nightmarish toll the Civil War took on their marriage in general and on Lincoln in particular..until April 14th, Ford's Theatre, and John Wilkes Booth put the final, traumatic end to the journey.Mary would essentially never know another happy day in what was left of her life, which descended into a nightmare worthy of Kafka.This is an indispensable DVD for anyone who might believe they know all there is to know about America's most tragic First Couple.Purchase it, by all means!",5,This man and this woman did indeed love one another.,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,1908,"['wife', 'as', 'handsome', 'when', 'was', 'girl', 'poor', 'nobody', 'fell', 'love', 'then', 'what', 'more', 'have', 'never', 'fallen', 'out', './/quote', 'Abraham', 'LincolnThere', 'are', 'generally', 'two', 'schools', 'thought', 'Lincoln', 'marriage', 'first', 'are', 'historians', 'scholars', 'regular', 'Lincolnites', 'who', 'insist', 'marriage', 'was', 'living', 'hell', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'one', 'pretty', 'much', 'destroyed', 'emotional', 'life', 'call', 'Herndon', 'School.Then', 'more', 'recent', 'approach', 'was', 'difficult', 'stormy', 'even', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship', 'two', 'people', 'did', 'indeed', 'love', 'one', 'Mary', 'was', 'not', 'depraved', 'witch', 'who', 'Lincoln', 'married', 'duress', 'was', 'Abe', 'always', 'long', 'suffering', 'saint', 'who', 'bore', 'cross', 'patience.What', 'baffling', 'people', 'who', 'insist', 'marriage', 'was', 'loveless', 'are', 'ignoring', 'words', 'straight', 'horse', 'mouth', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'fell', 'love', 'remained', 'love.This', 'informative', 'heartbreaking', 'series', 'hows', 'whys', 'how', 'two', 'vastly', 'different', 'people', 'came', 'together', 'made', 'family', 'achieved', 'goal', 'together', 'only', 'see', 'great', 'triumph', 'ultimately', 'destroy', 'family', 'ruin', 'lives', 'exactly', 'what', 'Presidency', 'did', 'Starting', 'death', 'much', 'loved', 'Willie', 'Mary', 'subsequent', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'death', 'favorite', 'child', 'Abraham', 'was', 'beginning', 'end', 'nightmarish', 'toll', 'Civil', 'War', 'took', 'marriage', 'general', 'Lincoln', 'particular..until', 'April', '14th', 'Ford', 'Theatre', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'put', 'final', 'traumatic', 'end', 'journey.Mary', 'would', 'essentially', 'never', 'know', 'happy', 'day', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'life', 'descended', 'nightmare', 'worthy', 'Kafka.This', 'indispensable', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'believe', 'know', 'know', 'America', 'most', 'tragic', 'First', 'Couple.Purchase', 'means']",N/A
677346,AOVU5A9GVXHFT,B00005R1NH,Margaret Opine,"[4, 4]","MARY TODD LINCOLN is revived by mothers who live troubles...Mrs. Lincoln came from a wealthy family and maybe ""caviar dreams"" but her life takes on a storyline like the wretched and powerless yet she sits in the First Lady Seat Of American Power.  She lost one son in his childhood, then another and another; she had one left but she was exhausted because in the meantime the American Civil War occurs and Mary had relatives on both side though she felt totally loyal to Abe Lincoln and the northern side of America.  (There was death and hell all around her.) She said that she wished her southern relatives' peril because if they were able to they would kill her husband and bring down the government he headed.  IN JUST THE AMERICAN WAY that it should be, two women came together to talk about their losses and to help each other cope with their healing by helping others who had escaped from American slavery: one the daughter of a wealthy southerner who bought and sold people for slavery and a woman, a highly skilled dressmaker, who had once made dresses for the southerners' First Lady,and who herself was once held in bondage and forced to be a slave. She became Mary's friend and confidante.  Life was going on for Mary and she was coping one step at a time and going forward when suddenly during an evening out at a theater her husband was shot in the head and his blood splattered over her. Mary's mind made its decision: It is time to check out, kaput, go mad, shut down from shock after shock after shock!!!!Abe had warned Mary that if she was not able to absorbed life's bad tidings and recover and go on and not shut down she would end up in an assylum.  That's where she landed; yet, another tradgedy but Mary dispatched her powerful friends (under-cover) and they came to rescue her; she lived in France for a while then returned to America.The Lincoln's were quiet people who wanted to do their jobs and live their lives with love and happiness.  Mary did not mind being left by ABE while he was away on America's business.  She stood by her husband as an American First Lady.(*There are stories that her husband had ""intimate male friends"" but these stories are. not mentioned in this documentary.)I have great sympathy and empathy for this First Lady's Life.  I feel Mary suffered a lot and though she did not stand up with (ideal) courage so we could praise her and honor her for that sort of strength; I feel strongly that Mary Todd Lincoln is the patron for American mothers who live troubles (no matter what their skin color is and no matter their body size and income and all that) but mothers who seem to live all the really hard and troubling knocks from life.  Mary's life also teaches that it is best to learn how to ""forgive"" and ""let go"" and go on and gain strength from your personal ability to NOT linger in mourning or wallow in pity, (something like that).But that's a really hard thing to do if you lose three children, some siblings and your husband is shot sitting next to you and his blood splatters all over you...so have no shame in your game if you can't get up right away...but definitely intend-to before somebody locks you away and you can't get out.--MO",5,MARY TODD LINCOLN IS REVIVED by mothers who live troubles...,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,3200,"['MARY', 'TODD', 'LINCOLN', 'revived', 'mothers', 'who', 'live', 'troubles', 'Mrs.', 'Lincoln', 'came', 'wealthy', 'family', 'maybe', 'caviar', 'dreams', 'life', 'storyline', 'wretched', 'powerless', 'yet', 'First', 'Lady', 'Seat', 'American', 'Power', 'lost', 'one', 'son', 'childhood', 'then', 'had', 'one', 'left', 'was', 'exhausted', 'because', 'meantime', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'occurs', 'Mary', 'had', 'relatives', 'side', 'felt', 'totally', 'loyal', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'northern', 'side', 'America', 'was', 'death', 'hell', 'said', 'wished', 'southern', 'relatives', 'peril', 'were', 'able', 'would', 'kill', 'husband', 'bring', 'down', 'government', 'headed', 'IN', 'JUST', 'THE', 'AMERICAN', 'WAY', 'should', 'be', 'two', 'women', 'came', 'together', 'talk', 'losses', 'help', 'other', 'cope', 'healing', 'helping', 'others', 'who', 'had', 'escaped', 'American', 'slavery', 'one', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'southerner', 'who', 'bought', 'sold', 'people', 'slavery', 'woman', 'highly', 'skilled', 'dressmaker', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'made', 'dresses', 'southerners', 'First', 'Lady', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'held', 'bondage', 'forced', 'be', 'slave', 'became', 'Mary', 'friend', 'confidante', 'Life', 'was', 'going', 'Mary', 'was', 'coping', 'one', 'step', 'time', 'going', 'forward', 'when', 'suddenly', 'evening', 'out', 'theater', 'husband', 'was', 'shot', 'head', 'blood', 'splattered', 'Mary', 'mind', 'made', 'decision', 'time', 'check', 'out', 'kaput', 'go', 'mad', 'shut', 'down', 'shock', 'shock', 'shock', 'Abe', 'had', 'warned', 'Mary', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'absorbed', 'life', 'bad', 'tidings', 'recover', 'go', 'not', 'shut', 'down', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'assylum', 'where', 'landed', 'yet', 'tradgedy', 'Mary', 'dispatched', 'powerful', 'friends', 'under-cover', 'came', 'rescue', 'lived', 'France', 'while', 'then', 'returned', 'America.The', 'Lincoln', 'were', 'quiet', 'people', 'who', 'wanted', 'do', 'jobs', 'live', 'lives', 'love', 'happiness', 'Mary', 'did', 'not', 'mind', 'being', 'left', 'ABE', 'was', 'away', 'America', 'business', 'stood', 'husband', 'American', 'First', 'Lady', 'are', 'stories', 'husband', 'had', 'intimate', 'male', 'friends', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'mentioned', 'documentary', 'have', 'great', 'sympathy', 'empathy', 'First', 'Lady', 'Life', 'feel', 'Mary', 'suffered', 'lot', 'did', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'ideal', 'courage', 'could', 'praise', 'honor', 'sort', 'strength', 'feel', 'strongly', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Lincoln', 'patron', 'American', 'mothers', 'who', 'live', 'troubles', 'matter', 'what', 'skin', 'color', 'matter', 'body', 'size', 'income', 'mothers', 'who', 'seem', 'live', 'really', 'hard', 'troubling', 'knocks', 'life', 'Mary', 'life', 'also', 'best', 'learn', 'how', 'forgive', 'let', 'go', 'go', 'gain', 'strength', 'personal', 'ability', 'NOT', 'linger', 'mourning', 'wallow', 'pity', 'something', '.But', 'really', 'hard', 'thing', 'do', 'lose', 'three', 'children', 'siblings', 'husband', 'shot', 'sitting', 'next', 'blood', 'splatters', 'so', 'have', 'shame', 'game', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'up', 'right', 'away', 'definitely', 'intend-to', 'somebody', 'locks', 'away', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'out.', 'MO']",N/A

677349,AT0E6UBVJMJ6W,B00005R1NH,Ms Winston,"[72, 73]","This documentary on the life of Abraham Lincoln is an excellent exploration of the character and inner life of our 16th president. At the same time it provides the viewer with much valuable information about the character of his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, their marriage, the tragic deaths of two of their children, and how Lincoln continued to love his wife until his death, even though she was in many ways a liability for him. While the Lincolns as individuals are the focus of the series, the viewer is not shortchanged in regard to the presidency or the Civil War. Lincoln's growth during his four years in office is examined critically and fairly by various historians.The story of the Lincolns was originally shown on PBS's program &quot;American Experience,&quot; and follows the format that has made that series so respected by viewers. Photographs, drawings, paintings, maps, and other artifacts contemporary to the times alternate with new film footage that enhances the story line. Well known performers do the voiceovers -- in this case David Morse is Lincoln, and Holly Hunter is the voice of Mary Todd Lincoln. There are no stagey recreations of events with unknown performers taking the parts of historical characters, which one often sees in series made for The History Channel or Arts and Entertainment Network. The three volume set runs about six hours and contains bonus materials that appear on each individual disc. The quality of the picture and sound is outstanding. The music is excellent and of the time period, and is never distacting.While people of all ages and backgrounds in American history could enjoy this series, I especially recommend it to families with high school or college age students, along with Ken Burns &quot;The Civil War&quot; and the PBS video biography of General Grant.
