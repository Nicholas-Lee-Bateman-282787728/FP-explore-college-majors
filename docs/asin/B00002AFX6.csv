514108,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B00002AFX6,James Morris,"[19, 19]","Of all the dozens of excellent films I have in my collection on VHS, this remains the film I would most like to see transferred to DVD. What a gem!When I originally purchased it without knowing a thing about it, I was slightly intrigued by the fact that the synopsis on the video box makes the film sound like a gritty suspense thriller, one of my favorite genres. The plot sounded interesting - a young black student is accused of murdering a white teen in NYC during the 1950's. OK, sounds like an intriguing piece of drama, I'll take it. So I took it home and was utterly blown away. One plot twist after another, fantastic acting, and a surprise theme, which turns out to be the main point of the film, kept me riveted to my seat for the entire film.The story was believable, the drama intense, and the ending heartbreaking. I kept thinking about this film for days after I'd seen it, and since then I have lent my VHS to a half dozen friends, all of who were as emotionally effected by its sincerity as I was. This minor masterpiece, which sadly seems to be quite obscure, is a piece of drama that I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone. If you can manage to find it anywhere, rent it, purchase it, copy it, or steal it. You won't be sorry.",5,Prepare To Be Blown Away,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,1250,"['dozens', 'excellent', 'films', 'have', 'collection', 'VHS', 'film', 'would', 'most', 'like', 'see', 'transferred', 'DVD', 'What', 'gem', 'When', 'originally', 'purchased', 'knowing', 'thing', 'was', 'slightly', 'intrigued', 'fact', 'synopsis', 'video', 'box', 'film', 'sound', 'gritty', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'one', 'favorite', 'genres', 'plot', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'young', 'black', 'student', 'accused', 'murdering', 'white', 'teen', 'NYC', '1950', 'OK', 'intriguing', 'piece', 'drama', ""'ll"", 'take', 'took', 'home', 'was', 'utterly', 'blown', 'away', 'One', 'plot', 'twist', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'surprise', 'theme', 'out', 'be', 'main', 'point', 'film', 'kept', 'riveted', 'seat', 'entire', 'film.The', 'story', 'was', 'believable', 'drama', 'intense', 'ending', 'heartbreaking', 'kept', 'thinking', 'film', 'days', ""'d"", 'seen', 'then', 'have', 'lent', 'VHS', 'half', 'dozen', 'friends', 'who', 'were', 'emotionally', 'effected', 'sincerity', 'was', 'minor', 'masterpiece', 'sadly', 'be', 'quite', 'obscure', 'piece', 'drama', 'would', 'not', 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'can', 'manage', 'find', 'anywhere', 'rent', 'purchase', 'steal', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry']",Blind Faith VHS

The story keeps you guessing, taking you from one preconceived notion to another.  Every single actor and each of their relationships comes fully alive under the stellar cast. Because the story and its characters ring so true, the challenging issues being confronted are easy to empathize with.  You can feel the tension and suspense in your bones, along with the fears being faced.  Actors Charles Dutton and Courtney Vance own their roles. Dutton actually came to life and rattled me for a second with his raw anger that seemed to erupt from deep down in his soul.  So why watch Blind Faith with all its intensity?  Maybe just to live in another man's shoes for a spell.
