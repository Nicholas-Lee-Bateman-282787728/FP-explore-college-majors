Of course, if you are expecting a horror movie where some masked killer with no motive runs around killing people over and over then this isn't for you. Yes, there is a ""wolf"" named George who is in a black cape and white wolf-looking mask, but if you watch the movie you realize that George isn't real, and that he is either a figment of the girls imagination or, that George is really the entity that takes over the girl (jenny) when she murders her victims. Jenny is a 12 year old girl living in Rome in an apartment all by herself, because her mother has once again left her and run off with a man. Her grandmother was left in custody of her and comes to Rome to ""stay"" with Jenny for a while, then take her back to New York with her. Jenny doesn't want to go anywhere, she is staying where she is and so is her Grandmother. She's intelligent for her age, structured, disciplined, organized, and some may percieve her as very controlling/bossy. They show when she was young that she had a little black lab named George, and George is her best friend and confidant and the only one she can trust. Now, that she's 12 George and her are inseperable. Except George is a very tall thing, with a black cape and hood, and a white make/face that looks like an abstract version of a wolf. Only she can see George of course, but she thinks he is real. They find their victims during the day, and punish them (by killing them) at night. They aren't just random people, they're people that Jenny sees committing crimes. For instance, one woman steals a bottle of wine. So she punishes all the offenders. I thought the movie was great.

875474,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0006Z2LFG,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Red Riding Hood (Giacomo Cimini, 2003)Red Riding Hood is another of those films I seem to be drawn to that was made in another country, horribly mismarketed in America, and suffered greatly for it in initial release. Usually it happens to southeast Asian supernatural dramas that get brought over as Yet Another Asian Horror Film, but in this case we have an Italian black comedy/thriller/musical/character study that was incorrectly called a horror flick. And if you go into it expecting a horror film (or, worse, a horror ""retelling"" of the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale), well, you're probably going to end up being one of the people who've given the movie, as of this writing, a 38% at Rotten Tomatoes and a 4.5 at IMDB. (Not that the recent horror retelling of said fairy tale, released in 2011 and starring Amanda Seyfried, did much better; 11% critical and 39% popular on RT, 5.2 on IMDB.) But if you go into it with no expectations and an open mind, you may find it more enjoyable than you expect. It's not great, but it's certainly not as bad as the ratings at the big websites would have you believe.Plot: a young girl named Jennifer McKenzie (Susanna Satta in her only screen appearance to date) has been left alone in her mother's palatial apartment in Rome...and she prefers it that way, with only her tutor, Tom (Exorcist: The Beginning's Rob David), on whom she has a major-league crush, and her imaginary...or is he?...friend George (Simone Dipascasio in his only screen appearance) to keep her company. While Tom teaches her about art and literature, she learns very different lessons from George, whom she takes out cruising the streets at night, looking for sinners upon whom she can visit vigilante justice. Life is going well for Jennifer, if not for her victims, until her Aunt Rose  (Kathleen Archebald, another newbie) comes to put her back under adult supervision, a move she does not take to kindly at all. Never fear, George is on the case...To be fair to the critics, there are a number of shortcomings in this movie, and the vituperation directed against the film from almost every direction has managed to hit on a few of them (in that stopped-clock kind of way). Most of the actors here are, in fact, amateurs, though I don't think that detracts from the film nearly as much as many others seem to; Susanna Satta's overacting, especially, gives the film an otherworldly, cartoonish quality that fits in quite well with the fantasy content here. Then there's the whole musical aspect. Which I don't know what to say about--you're either going to love it or hate it. I came in on the latter side, though that's probably my general dislike of musicals showing through rather than any dislike of this material in particular. And I'm not entirely sure where Cimini was attempting to go with the film's violence; he didn't succeed if he was going for the over-the-top cartoony violence of a film like (the original) Dawn of the Dead, and the more realistic feel he seems to have been aiming for is out-of-place in the film we ended up with. That's going to turn a lot of people off.Still, if you're looking for a slasher film that attempts to do something altogether different with the genre, Red Riding Hood is one to look up. ** ",3,"Kind of interesting, though very very mismarketed.",1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,3260,"['Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'Giacomo', 'Cimini', '2003', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'films', 'seem', 'be', 'drawn', 'was', 'made', 'country', 'horribly', 'mismarketed', 'America', 'suffered', 'greatly', 'initial', 'release', 'southeast', 'Asian', 'supernatural', 'dramas', 'get', 'brought', 'over', 'Yet', 'Asian', 'Horror', 'Film', 'case', 'have', 'Italian', 'black', 'comedy/thriller/musical/character', 'study', 'was', 'incorrectly', 'called', 'horror', 'flick', 'go', 'expecting', 'horror', 'film', 'worse', 'horror', 'retelling', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'fairy', 'tale', 'well', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'given', 'movie', 'writing', '38', '%', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', '4.5', 'IMDB', 'Not', 'recent', 'horror', 'retelling', 'said', 'fairy', 'tale', 'released', '2011', 'starring', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'did', 'much', 'better', '11', '%', 'critical', '39', '%', 'popular', 'RT', '5.2', 'IMDB', 'go', 'expectations', 'open', 'mind', 'may', 'find', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'expect', 'not', 'great', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'ratings', 'big', 'websites', 'would', 'have', 'believe.Plot', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Jennifer', 'McKenzie', 'Susanna', 'Satta', 'only', 'screen', 'appearance', 'date', 'been', 'left', 'alone', 'mother', 'palatial', 'apartment', 'Rome', 'way', 'only', 'tutor', 'Tom', 'Exorcist', 'Beginning', 'Rob', 'David', 'whom', 'major-league', 'crush', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'George', 'Simone', 'Dipascasio', 'only', 'screen', 'appearance', 'keep', 'company', 'Tom', 'art', 'literature', 'very', 'different', 'lessons', 'George', 'whom', 'out', 'cruising', 'streets', 'night', 'looking', 'sinners', 'whom', 'can', 'visit', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'Life', 'going', 'well', 'Jennifer', 'not', 'victims', 'Aunt', 'Rose', 'Kathleen', 'Archebald', 'newbie', 'put', 'back', 'adult', 'supervision', 'move', 'not', 'take', 'kindly', 'Never', 'fear', 'George', 'case', 'be', 'fair', 'critics', 'are', 'number', 'shortcomings', 'movie', 'vituperation', 'directed', 'film', 'almost', 'direction', 'managed', 'hit', 'few', 'stopped-clock', 'kind', 'way', 'Most', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'fact', 'amateurs', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'many', 'others', 'seem', 'Susanna', 'Satta', 'overacting', 'especially', 'film', 'otherworldly', 'cartoonish', 'quality', 'quite', 'well', 'fantasy', 'content', 'here', 'Then', 'whole', 'musical', 'aspect', 'Which', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'about', ""'re"", 'going', 'love', 'hate', 'came', 'latter', 'side', 'probably', 'general', 'dislike', 'musicals', 'showing', 'rather', 'dislike', 'material', 'particular', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'where', 'Cimini', 'was', 'attempting', 'go', 'film', 'violence', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'was', 'going', 'over-the-top', 'cartoony', 'violence', 'film', 'original', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'more', 'realistic', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'aiming', 'out-of-place', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'going', 'turn', 'lot', 'people', 'off.Still', ""'re"", 'looking', 'slasher', 'film', 'do', 'something', 'altogether', 'different', 'genre', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'one', 'look', 'up', '**']",Red Riding Hood

I can see why someone would give this a good review, and I can also see why someone would give it a terrible review. Yes it had bad acting in it. As a matter of fact, the lead girl was about the worst child actress I have ever seen. She was terrible. Yes it was a B horror movie, at time very generic, IT HAD TERRIBLE MUFFLED SOUND and it was very predictable (I knew who ""George"" really was in the first 15 minutes of the movie). The movie also stole ideas from every other movie, BUT for some reason I really liked this movie. Maybe I'm just a sucker for revenge plots, and vigilante plots. Or maybe I just bought into the gore, but I thought it was a twisted spin on an over told story. I think they successfully beat a dead horse. The gore in this is very outdated. By that I mean, you just don't see horror movies these days putting that much gore into a movie anymore. For that, I was generous with my stars. Next, some of the things this girl does to her granny are just plain twisted. Yes, stolen ideas from the movies like ""Misery,"" but we are talking her own granny! Anyway, my gore meter was pretty full after this one, It made me laugh. I was laughing at the dumb acting, the bad lines, and the way that some of the victims died.  I think the movie is a 4 star movie and probably need to see a shrink. If I had to compare it to something, it would be a generic ""Donnie Darko"", meets ""Misery"", meets ""Omen"", meets ""Death Wish"" (maybe?) For the record though, I should mention that my wife thought it was stupid and would probably give it 1 or 2 stars.",4,"Generic, but there is something real evil about this",1112918400,"04 8, 2005",2005,1595,"['Let', 'explain', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'give', 'good', 'review', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'give', 'terrible', 'review', 'Yes', 'had', 'bad', 'acting', 'matter', 'fact', 'lead', 'girl', 'was', 'worst', 'child', 'actress', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'terrible', 'Yes', 'was', 'B', 'horror', 'movie', 'time', 'very', 'generic', 'IT', 'HAD', 'TERRIBLE', 'MUFFLED', 'SOUND', 'was', 'very', 'predictable', 'knew', 'who', 'George', 'really', 'was', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'movie', 'also', 'stole', 'ideas', 'other', 'movie', 'BUT', 'reason', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'sucker', 'revenge', 'plots', 'vigilante', 'plots', 'maybe', 'just', 'bought', 'gore', 'thought', 'was', 'twisted', 'spin', 'told', 'story', 'think', 'successfully', 'beat', 'dead', 'horse', 'gore', 'very', 'outdated', 'mean', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'horror', 'movies', 'days', 'putting', 'much', 'gore', 'movie', 'anymore', 'was', 'generous', 'stars', 'Next', 'things', 'girl', 'her', 'granny', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'twisted', 'Yes', 'stolen', 'ideas', 'movies', 'Misery', 'are', 'talking', 'own', 'granny', 'Anyway', 'gore', 'meter', 'was', 'pretty', 'full', 'one', 'made', 'was', 'laughing', 'dumb', 'acting', 'bad', 'lines', 'way', 'victims', 'died', 'think', 'movie', '4', 'star', 'movie', 'probably', 'need', 'see', 'shrink', 'had', 'compare', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'generic', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Misery', 'Omen', 'Death', 'Wish', 'maybe', 'record', 'should', 'mention', 'wife', 'thought', 'was', 'stupid', 'would', 'probably', 'give', '1', '2', 'stars']",Red Riding Hood
