803193,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0001FR3HM,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","You now the scenario; boy meets girl, girl is out of boys league BUT boy has something that girl wants so she takes what she wants and gives him what he wants only to find out that he USED to be everything she ever wanted.  This same concept has been used and abused for years.  In fact, this very film is a remake.  That said; this movie has some serious charm, which really works to its benefit.  Not that I'm a huge fan of Mr. Mariah Carey, but he has some nice comedic timing, and his faux swag (I say faux only because he is far more believable as a nerd) is entertaining.  Christina Milian is a cutey, and she really comes through as the popular girl lost in a sea of popularity she kind of resents.  The message presented, about being yourself and not formulating to the molds of teenage society, is a nice one (albeit an overused and underdeveloped one), and the bouncy infectious teenage quality to the film is nothing short of enjoyable.  I kind of loathe Steve Harvey, so his mug gracing the screen was a turn-off, and his ridiculous attempt at emulating Eugene Levy's iconic `American Pie' father role was a total misfire; but you have to expect a film like this to have its downs to balance out the ups.

I found out this movie was on Cinemax OnDemand so I watched it. As I'm watching it, I'm thinking this movie isn't too bad. Then the following day, my opinion changed on this movie. The movie went from a not too bad movie to watch occasionally to a must have movie. The movie is great because of the chemistry between Nick Cannon and Christina Milian. Cannon plays Alvin, a really smart guy with two part-time jobs but is a social outcast. Milian plays Paris, the most popular girl in school and the girl that every guy in high school dreams of dating. Alvin is one of those guys and when Paris takes her mother's Escalade in for repair, Alvin buys the parts to fix it and they make a deal that they have to pretend to be boyfriend and girlfriend. She turns him into a cool person and everybody likes him. But his ego gets in the way of his future and his original friends lose respect for him, his family is concerned about him, and Paris comes to like the old Alvin instead of the new Alvin. I really like this movie. Alvin is awesome because he's someone we can relate to and Paris is sweet and hot. This movie is a combination of two movies I hate. Those movies are Class Act and Can't Hardly Wait. I hate each movie for a different reason. I hate Class Act because it's off-key and I hate Can't Hardly Wait because JLH is in it. But this movie has a better script and everybody plays their part well here. Kenan Thompson does a great job as one of Alvin's friends and Steve Harvey is hilarious as Alvin's dad. This movie further exposes how biast movie critics are and how political The Oscars are.

803199,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B0001FR3HM,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[0, 0]","I was set against watching this movie for it looked generic and stupid, but it was a lazy day Saturday and it was on TV so I gave it a shot and much to my enjoyment it wasn't half bad.  I've always felt Nick Cannon was funny, but it was Christina Milian who really impressed me.  She's a very talented young girl, with her acting as well as her singing, and she brings the best of both here in this film.  I will say though that I am not a fan of Steve Harvey and I don't really think he'll ever do something I enjoy...his character to me was nothing special and would have preferred he be played by anyone else, but alas, he didn't take away anything from the film so he was tolerable.The film itself is a remake of the '87 comedy `Can't Buy Me Love', which I've never seen but probably will rent just for kicks.  It's a story about Alvin (Cannon) who's the super smart nerd in school who wishes that just once he could experience popularity.  When Paris (Milian), one of the most popular girls in school, damages her mother's car and needs help in a hurry Alvin is there is offer his assistance in exchange for a chance to be cool.  Paris agrees to fake a two-week relationship with Alvin in order to get him in with her crowd and then they'll split up publicly and continue with their newfound lives.Over the course of the film the predictable plot thickens, for we all know that Alvin and Paris will fall in love and end up together, but how this happens of course will have it's twists and turns and they will try and make us believe they won't get together but we all know how it will end.  That said, it's still a fun ride, with great chemistry between the two leads, Cannon showing great comedic range and Milian giving us warmth in what could have been a very generic role.  Bottom line is, while it's nothing new, it's still a fun way to spend an afternoon.",4,A Nice Surprise,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,1867,"['was', 'set', 'watching', 'movie', 'looked', 'generic', 'stupid', 'was', 'lazy', 'day', 'Saturday', 'was', 'TV', 'gave', 'shot', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'was', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'Christina', 'Milian', 'who', 'really', 'impressed', 'very', 'talented', 'young', 'girl', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'singing', 'best', 'here', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'do', 'something', 'enjoy', 'character', 'was', 'nothing', 'special', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'be', 'played', 'anyone', 'else', 'alas', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'anything', 'film', 'was', 'tolerable.The', 'film', 'remake', ""'87"", 'comedy', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'probably', 'will', 'rent', 'just', 'kicks', 'story', 'Alvin', 'Cannon', 'who', 'super', 'smart', 'nerd', 'school', 'who', 'just', 'once', 'could', 'experience', 'popularity', 'When', 'Paris', 'Milian', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'girls', 'school', 'damages', 'mother', 'car', 'help', 'hurry', 'Alvin', 'offer', 'assistance', 'exchange', 'chance', 'be', 'cool', 'Paris', 'fake', 'two-week', 'relationship', 'Alvin', 'order', 'get', 'crowd', 'then', ""'ll"", 'split', 'up', 'publicly', 'continue', 'newfound', 'course', 'film', 'predictable', 'plot', 'thickens', 'know', 'Alvin', 'Paris', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'how', 'course', 'will', 'have', 'twists', 'turns', 'will', 'try', 'make', 'believe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'together', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'said', 'still', 'fun', 'ride', 'great', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'Cannon', 'showing', 'great', 'comedic', 'range', 'Milian', 'giving', 'warmth', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'generic', 'role', 'Bottom', 'line', 'nothing', 'new', 'still', 'fun', 'way', 'spend', 'afternoon']",Love Don't Cost a Thing
803200,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B0001FR3HM,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[0, 1]","This movie started out slow, but it managed to pull it all together in the end.This is another high school flick making an attempt at uncovering the uselessness of trying to be someone you're not.  Alvin Johnson has never quite fit in; he has a nerd-crew he hangs with, but it is his dream to get close the elitist of the elite, Paris Morgan (played by Christina Milian).  When Paris wrecks her Mom's car, the mechanically inclined Alvin takes advantage of the situation, offering to fix Paris's car and pay for the parts.  The only catch, Paris has to hang with Alvin for two weeks.  Well, he wanted a month, but they settled for the two weeks.  After all, he is kind of a geek!Alvin and Paris end up becoming friends and she tries to change his image, and this is where the movie gets really good.  Christina Milian is an excellent actress; she manages to make the scenes in this predictable sequence (her finding him clothes and a new hairstyle) work really well.  She doesn't over act at all, and this makes the movie a breath of fresh air.There is a great scene in this film, one that should become a classic:  Alvin and Paris are talking to each other (really listening too) and Alvin mentions that he almost had a college scholarship because of his mechanical abilities, but he wasn't able to get the final part for their automobile engine.  When Paris presses him for more information, she learns that he used all of his money (that  was supposed to be for the part) to fix her car, she truly begins to care for him, seeing the side of him she has ignored.As I have said, this movie starts out slow but finishes strong.  I liked it a lot.  Christina Milian is one of the most beautiful girls on the screen right now.  She is also a great actress (LOL, you're not going to believe this - I had never even heard of her before this movie!...told ya you wouldn't believe it).Now, is this movie for younger kids?  Nope, not unless you want your kids to see a Dad explaining to his teenage son how to put a condom on and score with the ladies.

803201,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B0001FR3HM,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[1, 2]","""Love Don't Cost a Thing"" is a remake of an 80's movie ""Can't Buy Me Love."" The thing that saved this movie was Steve Harvey. He was probally in this movie for about twenty, twenty five minutes, and he stole every scene that he was in. It was also kind of sweet and you feel bad for the main character Alvin, played by Nick Cannon. Cannon was in the hit ""Drumline"" last year, which I missed, but I'm sure he did fine in that movie, because he did well in this. The story of this movie is the same as ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" and unlike that movie, this one works. Cannon is joined by Christina Millian, who probally could have been replaced by somebody a little less cute, because she wasn't that right for the role.""Love Don't Cost a Thing"" is about Alvin Johnson, a nerdy kid that is usually invisable to the other students at his high school. He works in a local auto shop, where he is quite good at what he does. When he's not hanging out with his friends Walter, Chuck, and Ken, he is working on making a car for a science competition. He also gets embarrassing sexual advice from his father Clarence, played by Steve Harvey. Steve Harvey has a comedic talents where you can't help grinning because he is grinning, and you know that something funny is going to come out of his mouth. He has a crush on a girl, Paris, but so does everybody else in the school. His luck changes when Paris wrecks her mother's car. Her mother is away for the weekend, but Paris needs it fixed before she gets home. Alvin makes a deal with her. He could fix the car before her mother comes home, and she will pretend to be dating him so that he could become popular. She agrees. The next Monday at school they pretend to be dating, to the shock of the school, including her crowd of friends. With advice from her, he begins to change his image. From nerdy Alvin, to cool Alvin, much to the dismay of his friends who begin to not like him because she is not being himself. Alvin and Paris begin to fall for each other, and that makes Alvin question weather he should go back to his normal self, or continue with the image that everybody else thinks is cool.The chemistry between Alvin and Paris is well done. You could feel for these characters and throughout the movie you are always hoping for them to get together with each other, even though they might not, because she already has a boyfriend. It was a good movie, but its problem is that it has scenes that are useless. Useless scenes ruin many movies, and ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"" is one of them. Worth an afternoon theatre ticket, but for an evening show you should see something else.ENJOY!Rated PG-13 for sexual content/humor.",4,Steve Harvey: The Scene Stealer!,1075507200,"01 31, 2004",2004,2666,"['Love', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cost', 'Thing', 'remake', '80', 'movie', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'thing', 'saved', 'movie', 'was', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'was', 'probally', 'movie', 'twenty', 'twenty', 'five', 'minutes', 'stole', 'scene', 'was', 'was', 'also', 'kind', 'sweet', 'feel', 'bad', 'main', 'character', 'Alvin', 'played', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'Cannon', 'was', 'hit', 'Drumline', 'last', 'year', 'missed', ""'m"", 'sure', 'did', 'fine', 'movie', 'did', 'well', 'story', 'movie', 'same', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'movie', 'one', 'works', 'Cannon', 'joined', 'Christina', 'Millian', 'who', 'probally', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'somebody', 'little', 'less', 'cute', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'right', 'role', 'Love', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cost', 'Thing', 'Alvin', 'Johnson', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'usually', 'invisable', 'other', 'students', 'high', 'school', 'local', 'auto', 'shop', 'where', 'quite', 'good', 'what', 'When', 'not', 'hanging', 'out', 'friends', 'Walter', 'Chuck', 'Ken', 'working', 'making', 'car', 'science', 'competition', 'also', 'embarrassing', 'sexual', 'advice', 'father', 'Clarence', 'played', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'comedic', 'talents', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'grinning', 'grinning', 'know', 'something', 'funny', 'going', 'come', 'mouth', 'crush', 'girl', 'Paris', 'so', 'everybody', 'else', 'school', 'luck', 'changes', 'when', 'Paris', 'mother', 'car', 'mother', 'away', 'weekend', 'Paris', 'fixed', 'home', 'Alvin', 'deal', 'could', 'fix', 'car', 'mother', 'home', 'will', 'pretend', 'be', 'dating', 'so', 'could', 'become', 'popular', 'next', 'Monday', 'school', 'pretend', 'be', 'dating', 'shock', 'school', 'including', 'crowd', 'friends', 'advice', 'change', 'image', 'nerdy', 'Alvin', 'cool', 'Alvin', 'much', 'dismay', 'friends', 'who', 'begin', 'not', 'like', 'not', 'being', 'Alvin', 'Paris', 'begin', 'fall', 'other', 'Alvin', 'question', 'weather', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'normal', 'self', 'continue', 'image', 'everybody', 'else', 'cool.The', 'chemistry', 'Alvin', 'Paris', 'well', 'done', 'could', 'feel', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'always', 'hoping', 'get', 'together', 'other', 'even', 'might', 'not', 'already', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'problem', 'scenes', 'are', 'useless', 'Useless', 'scenes', 'ruin', 'many', 'movies', 'Love', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cost', 'Thing', 'one', 'afternoon', 'theatre', 'ticket', 'evening', 'show', 'should', 'see', 'something', 'else.ENJOY', 'Rated', 'PG-13', 'sexual', 'content/humor']",Love Don't Cost a Thing
803202,A2RZUFRYRHTRS8,B0001FR3HM,jasoneducator,"[1, 1]","This film gets a mixed review at best from me. I check out films like this with my goddaughter who is 11. I loved Drumline and thought Cannon was pretty good in it. I believe he does some cable stuff on TV and I thought that I would be okay taking an 11 year old to this movie.The film has a good message and predictably marches along its path. Nick Cannon's transformation is kind of abrupt. From Poolboy to trendsetter the events that transformed him seemed kind of abrupt. The big deal for me was there was an ongoing condom theme in the flick that caught me off guard. I don't think it was in the promos and I felt somewhat misled. I would not advise any parents to let their young kids watch this movie unless kids understand what condoms are and I wouldn't watch this with your kids unless you are prepared to have that discussion.I have mixed feelings about that being a major joke in a PG-13 movie. On the one hand, I think adult themes should go under the radar and not be easily understood by kids or have questionable language. On the other hand there are far too many PG-13 movies that have borderline explicit sexuality without addressing safe sex.

At first, the idea of a remake bothered me. Then, I saw the trailer and thought it could be a good urban twist on the familiar story, and I decided to give it a chance. Good casting saves the lackluster script, which really brings nothing new to the story, journeying into familiar territory where we have gotten lost countless times before. Christina Millian, Nick Cannon, and Steve Harvey are all terrific, but the film is slow moving and often boring. A rushed ending does nothing to help it and tops the pizza with an unneeded extra slice of cheese.

His hope is that, through his association with her, he will gain entree into the ?cool? crowd at school.The stereotypes of adolescents that the film presents weren?t fresh twenty years ago and they?re even less so today.

True to the formula, Alvin eventually learns a lesson or two about what being true to oneself really means.There are virtually no funny moments in the film and the scenes between Alvin and his sex-obsessed dad begin to border on the creepy.  ?Love Don?t Cost a Thing? may seem clever and fresh to audiences not old enough to have seen many movies, let alone the original on which this film is based.

Not to mention Paris is dating NBA player Drew, despite the fact that he is playing her by cheating on her and claiming he is single on national TV.  Alvin is working on a project that can help him get a scholarship.  Paris crashes her Moms Escalade.  To fix the damage will cost $1,500.  Alvin has the money and he offers to pay for the parts needed if she will be his girlfriend to help him get popular.Alvin's father (Steve Harvey) is stuck in the 70's.  He loved himself some Al Green, and the plastic covered furniture brought back some memories!!!  I never heard of a school having a popular hallway before.  That was very unusual to me.Paris helps Alvin change his image buy changing his hair and helping him pick out new clothing.  ""Urkel has gone gangster"", when his younger sister seems him walk into the house all transformed.Alvin is so into his new popular friends his old buddies feel left out and turn away from him.  Alvin enjoys being popular but to Paris being popular is nothing but work.  Paris finds herself liking Alving to her surprise.  She can talk to him, and he understands her wanting to have a ""normal life"" and he finds the fact that she can write poetry and play guitar interesting while her friends feel she should focus on eventually marrying her rich NBA playa boyfriend.Turns out popularity comes with a price.  As different as Paris and Alvin were, turned out they were the same.  Trying to be something they were not.  You get that much from watching the film.My one problem with the movie was the scene where father does the right of passage with the condoms.  Telling Alvin his main goal should be scratching the kitty kat really annoyed me.  On one hand I was glad he had the safe sex talk, but we all know if the tables had been turned and his daughter was about to go on a date he would have been installing ""kitty kat"" devices to keep the boys away!!!!

The male character goes from erkel to puff doody overnight and is never likeable.  Why the hot chick goes for him after all the stupid stuff he pulls is beyond comprehension.  Stereotypes abound in this movie and none of them add anything to the humorless wreck.  At the end I felt sorry for the nice selfless cheerleader (one non-stereotype anyway) who ends up with the goofy jerk in the end.",2,Don't waste your time,1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,463,"['Love', 'may', 'not', 'cost', 'thing', 'movie', 'not', 'male', 'character', 'erkel', 'puff', 'doody', 'overnight', 'never', 'likeable', 'Why', 'hot', 'chick', 'stupid', 'stuff', 'comprehension', 'Stereotypes', 'abound', 'movie', 'none', 'add', 'anything', 'humorless', 'wreck', 'end', 'felt', 'sorry', 'nice', 'selfless', 'cheerleader', 'one', 'non-stereotype', 'anyway', 'who', 'up', 'goofy', 'jerk', 'end']",Love Don't Cost a Thing
