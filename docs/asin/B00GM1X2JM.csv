1678734,A2ZELOPYDRS6VU,B00GM1X2JM,Love Our Military Men,"[10, 10]","I am so happy to see more releases of the this wonderful television series IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT coming to DVD, despite the very unusual sequence/release schedule...first the marathon release with selected episodes from each season, then season one followed by season eight - and now seasons four and five. Season three (not yet released), four and five really saw the series hit its stride.Airing for 142 episodes (plus 4 TV movies) from '88-'95, IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is one of my favorite crime drama series that starred Carroll O'Conner in the lead role as &#34;Chief 'Bill' Gillepsie&#34; of the Sparta Police Department in Mississippi and centered on a lot of small town politics as well catching the criminals. It was a role that was really suited for Carrol O'Conner and I was really glad when his real life 'adopted' son Hugh O'Conner's character was given a front and centered role in the series (before his very untimely and tragic death). An of course, Alan Autry as &#34;Lt. 'Bubba' Skinner&#34; sure filled out his uniform v-e-r-y nicely! :o)Please be aware (as stated in the product description) that there are 3 episodes that are not included in this release due to licensing issues: &#34;SWEET, SWEET BLUES&#34;, &#34;SANCTUARY&#34;, and &#34;LAW ON TRIAL&#34;.The picture quality to date on these releases has been very good.Can't wait for seasons 3, 6 and 7 (whichever order they end of coming out - LOL!)",4,IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT SEASON FIVE - SURE GLAD TO SEE MORE RELEASES BECOMING AVAILABLE,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,1430,"['am', 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'more', 'releases', 'wonderful', 'television', 'series', 'IN', 'THE', 'HEAT', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'coming', 'DVD', 'very', 'unusual', 'sequence/release', 'schedule', 'first', 'marathon', 'release', 'selected', 'episodes', 'season', 'then', 'season', 'one', 'followed', 'season', 'eight', 'now', 'seasons', 'four', 'five', 'Season', 'three', 'not', 'yet', 'released', 'four', 'five', 'really', 'saw', 'series', 'hit', 'stride.Airing', '142', 'episodes', '4', 'TV', 'movies', ""'88-'95"", 'IN', 'THE', 'HEAT', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'one', 'favorite', 'crime', 'drama', 'series', 'starred', 'Carroll', ""O'Conner"", 'lead', 'role', '34', 'Chief', ""'Bill"", 'Gillepsie', '34', 'Sparta', 'Police', 'Department', 'Mississippi', 'centered', 'lot', 'small', 'town', 'politics', 'well', 'catching', 'criminals', 'was', 'role', 'was', 'really', 'suited', 'Carrol', ""O'Conner"", 'was', 'really', 'glad', 'when', 'real', 'life', ""'adopted"", 'son', 'Hugh', ""O'Conner"", 'character', 'was', 'given', 'front', 'centered', 'role', 'series', 'very', 'untimely', 'tragic', 'death', 'course', 'Alan', 'Autry', '34', 'Lt.', ""'Bubba"", 'Skinner', '34', 'sure', 'filled', 'out', 'uniform', 'v-e-r-y', 'nicely', 'o', 'Please', 'be', 'aware', 'stated', 'product', 'description', 'are', '3', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'release', 'due', 'licensing', 'issues', '34', 'SWEET', 'SWEET', 'BLUES', '34', '34', 'SANCTUARY', '34', '34', 'LAW', 'ON', 'TRIAL', '34', '.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'date', 'releases', 'been', 'very', 'good.Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'seasons', '3', '6', '7', 'order', 'end', 'coming', 'out', 'LOL']",In The Heat of The Night Season 5
