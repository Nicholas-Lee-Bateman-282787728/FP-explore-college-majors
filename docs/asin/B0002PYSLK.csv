Unable to give the baby to an orphanage, Major Burdle raises renamed Dan 'Burdle' (played by 17-year old Jimmy Lydon) to be an assistant, huckstering a quack drunkeness cure.  The authorities want the child in a school; so Major Burdle sends Dan to the Plumfield School, a progressive, private farm school.  The Major himself impresses the school owners so much they give him the endowment fund to manage.  Dan starts out resistant and hostile.  The Major and Denning go off to swindle some more.  Then bad things happen, and the movie comes to a suitiable mixed- happy conclusion, with the swindlers showing some character.The film is in black and white from 1940.  Alpha Vidio's picture and sound are clean enough.  The best part of the film come from the comic touches of Jack Oakie, with George Bancroft also being amusing.  The other characters are not memorable.There are a couple of schoolyard fight scenes and no sex scenes.  Other than Dan in a bathtub, suds to the waist, begging not to be sent away to school, there are no skin shots.The only extra is the Alpha Video catalogue.",3,Big Men More Interesting Than The Little Ones,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,1317,"['Major', 'Burdle', 'played', 'George', 'Bancroft', 'was', 'making', 'comfortable', 'living', 'off', 'cute', 'swindle', 'when', 'bank', 'robber', 'pal', 'William', 'Denning', 'played', 'famous', 'comedian', 'Jack', 'Oakie', 'up', 'passes', 'infant', 'son', 'crook', 'Unable', 'give', 'baby', 'orphanage', 'Major', 'Burdle', 'renamed', 'Dan', ""'Burdle"", 'played', '17-year', 'old', 'Jimmy', 'Lydon', 'be', 'assistant', 'huckstering', 'quack', 'drunkeness', 'cure', 'authorities', 'want', 'child', 'school', 'Major', 'Burdle', 'Dan', 'Plumfield', 'School', 'progressive', 'private', 'farm', 'school', 'Major', 'school', 'owners', 'so', 'much', 'give', 'endowment', 'fund', 'manage', 'Dan', 'out', 'resistant', 'hostile', 'Major', 'Denning', 'go', 'off', 'swindle', 'more', 'Then', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'movie', 'suitiable', 'mixed-', 'happy', 'conclusion', 'swindlers', 'showing', 'character.The', 'film', 'black', 'white', '1940', 'Alpha', 'Vidio', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'clean', 'enough', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'come', 'comic', 'touches', 'Jack', 'Oakie', 'George', 'Bancroft', 'also', 'being', 'amusing', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'memorable.There', 'are', 'couple', 'schoolyard', 'fight', 'scenes', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Other', 'Dan', 'bathtub', 'suds', 'waist', 'begging', 'not', 'be', 'sent', 'away', 'school', 'are', 'skin', 'only', 'extra', 'Alpha', 'Video', 'catalogue']",N/A

Yet, if you know that, and thus, are not feeling misled and deceived; it is a good movie. Ironically, it is about a swindler.The school is quaint, on a farm. The story revolves around the boy's father, who is a struggling, charming, swindler; searching for new schemes with his partner. His son (Jimmy Lydon) is sent to boarding-school, and becomes embarrassed by his father's career. The school is struggling financially; the boy is struggling to fit in; the father is struggling.It is not a great movie, but I enjoyed it. There is some humor and charm. It keeps your interest.(Amazon's ""Instant-Video"" link takes you to a different movie by the same name with a different story, and different actors.)A good deal, at the cost of a movie-rental.The father advertises in the newspaper: ""Send $3 and receive a fine quality portrait of President Washington, by a professional artist with exquisite detail"".See the ""comment"" button below for my review of the other movie by the same title starring Ralph Morgan and Frankie Darro.",4,Pleasant.,1180224000,"05 27, 2007",2007,1468,"['are', 'three', 'entirely', 'different', 'movies', 'same', 'title', 'Little', 'Men', 'TV-series.Amazon', 'commingled', 'reviews', 'two', 'entirely', 'different', 'older', 'black', 'white', 'movies.One', 'movie', 'stars', 'Ralph', 'Morgan', 'Frankie', 'Darro.The', 'different', 'movie', 'story', 'review', 'stars', 'Jimmy', 'Lydon', 'Jack', 'Oakie.The', 'negative', 'reviews', 'are', 'only', 'movie', 'starring', 'Jimmy', 'Lydon', 'completely', 'different', 'story', 'book', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'know', 'thus', 'are', 'not', 'feeling', 'misled', 'deceived', 'good', 'movie', 'Ironically', 'swindler.The', 'school', 'quaint', 'farm', 'story', 'boy', 'father', 'who', 'struggling', 'charming', 'swindler', 'searching', 'new', 'schemes', 'partner', 'son', 'Jimmy', 'Lydon', 'sent', 'boarding-school', 'becomes', 'embarrassed', 'father', 'career', 'school', 'struggling', 'financially', 'boy', 'struggling', 'fit', 'father', 'struggling.It', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'humor', 'charm', 'interest', 'Amazon', 'Instant-Video', 'link', 'different', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'different', 'story', 'different', 'actors', 'good', 'deal', 'cost', 'movie-rental.The', 'father', 'advertises', 'newspaper', 'Send', '3', 'receive', 'fine', 'quality', 'portrait', 'President', 'Washington', 'professional', 'artist', 'exquisite', 'detail', '.See', 'comment', 'button', 'review', 'other', 'movie', 'same', 'title', 'starring', 'Ralph', 'Morgan', 'Frankie', 'Darro']",N/A

We were barely 30 seconds into this when she became angry at how far the film is from the book, making it into a kind of idiotic comedy rather than the subtle social commentary from the original, adding characters not in the book, etc.  Moreover, many of the aspects of Jo's situations are changed in ridiculous ways, such as putting their occupancy of the school at risk as a plot device.  Also, this film makes a horrible mash of the characters, such as Jo's husband, who comes off as a naive buffoon.This is a perfectly awful version that betrays the book's depth for comedy effects.
