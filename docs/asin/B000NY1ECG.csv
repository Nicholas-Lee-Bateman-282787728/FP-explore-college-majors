During his life as a musician, he abused his body and ticked off a lot of people but has a voice like no other and wrote song lyrics that kicked butt.

As Emmylou Harris stated in an interview on the DVD, he needs no introduction.  He needs no dancers, or smoke screens or anything else like that.  He is a living legend and is quite simply one of the greatest singers of any genre of music to ever walk the face of the Earth.  In a concert format, several country stars, old and new, pay tribute to Jones by singing some of his most classic, greatest hits.  Most of the instantly recognizable ones are here, such as ""A Picture of Me Without You"", ""The Grand Tour"", ""The Race is On"", and ""She Thinks I Still Care"", and many more.  There are also a few less known ones, such as ""One of These Days"".  George Jones wraps it all up with his biggest hit, and the greatest country song ever recorded, ""He Stopped Loving Her Today"".  I personally would have liked to see a few more well known ones but this is still a superb DVD in honor of Jones, with great sound and picture quality.",5,A Celebration of the Greatest Living Country Singer,1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,1004,"['course', 'greatest', 'living', 'country', 'singer', 'would', 'be', 'George', 'Possum', 'Jones', 'Emmylou', 'Harris', 'stated', 'interview', 'DVD', 'introduction', 'dancers', 'smoke', 'screens', 'anything', 'else', 'living', 'legend', 'quite', 'simply', 'one', 'greatest', 'singers', 'genre', 'music', 'ever', 'walk', 'face', 'Earth', 'concert', 'format', 'several', 'country', 'stars', 'old', 'new', 'pay', 'tribute', 'Jones', 'singing', 'most', 'classic', 'greatest', 'hits', 'Most', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'ones', 'are', 'here', 'such', 'A', 'Picture', 'Me', 'Grand', 'Tour', 'Race', 'Still', 'Care', 'many', 'more', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'less', 'known', 'ones', 'such', 'One', 'Days', 'George', 'Jones', 'up', 'biggest', 'hit', 'greatest', 'country', 'song', 'ever', 'recorded', 'Stopped', 'Loving', 'Today', 'personally', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'few', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'ones', 'still', 'superb', 'DVD', 'honor', 'Jones', 'great', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality']",N/A
