1263754,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B002DLB1I4,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[1, 2]","Live from Wembley is a pinnacle performance by the British ""Executive Transvestite"" comedian Eddie Izzard from his Sexie tour. Unlike the eponymous release, Live from Wembley features Eddie on form and the audience in the palm of his hand.Eddie's performance is wonderfully energetic and imaginative. Unlike the performance of Circle - which had brilliant material but Eddie was a bit too self-conscious that night - Live from Wembley features Eddie with a great stage presence and swagger. The material is wonderfully diverse, and Eddie's pantomime and train of thought is hilarious and a riot to follow. Eddie covers everything from Neanderthals to Medusa's hairdresser, from sharks to disco flies, and back again.This is Eddie at his best. Stripped is a more average show with lesser delivery (although Live from Madison Square Garden is to that tour what Live from Wembley is to Sexie). While not on par with Definite Article, Glorious or Dress to Kill, Live from Wembley is a riot of a time that had me in fits of (almost quite literally) non-stop laughter. The hour-and-a-half you invest in it flies by, and you better try your best to keep up with Eddie.",5,"The Better Version of Sexie, By a Mile!",1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,1161,"['Live', 'Wembley', 'pinnacle', 'performance', 'British', 'Executive', 'Transvestite', 'comedian', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'Sexie', 'tour', 'eponymous', 'release', 'Live', 'Wembley', 'features', 'Eddie', 'form', 'audience', 'palm', 'hand.Eddie', 'performance', 'wonderfully', 'energetic', 'imaginative', 'performance', 'Circle', 'had', 'brilliant', 'material', 'Eddie', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'self-conscious', 'night', 'Live', 'Wembley', 'features', 'Eddie', 'great', 'stage', 'presence', 'swagger', 'material', 'wonderfully', 'diverse', 'Eddie', 'pantomime', 'train', 'thought', 'hilarious', 'riot', 'follow', 'Eddie', 'everything', 'Neanderthals', 'Medusa', 'hairdresser', 'sharks', 'disco', 'flies', 'back', 'again.This', 'Eddie', 'best', 'Stripped', 'more', 'average', 'show', 'lesser', 'delivery', 'Live', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'tour', 'what', 'Live', 'Wembley', 'Sexie', 'not', 'par', 'Definite', 'Article', 'Glorious', 'Dress', 'Kill', 'Live', 'Wembley', 'riot', 'time', 'had', 'fits', 'almost', 'quite', 'literally', 'non-stop', 'laughter', 'hour-and-a-half', 'invest', 'better', 'try', 'best', 'keep', 'up', 'Eddie']",Eddie Izzard: Live from Wembley

What I think most people miss is that he was very nervous.  He was very hyper at the start. He didn't settle down for 20 minutes or more. One of Eddie's true gifts is his ability to take his time to tell a joke and during that time the audience becomes completely invested in everything he has to say. He owns us. He was possibly nervous because most of his audience had never seen him with his breasts. Maybe he wasn't sure how he would be accepted. The spiked heels seemed to be a problem for him. He seemed to have a great deal of difficulty standing up or standing still in them or maybe that was also just part of being nervous. The film quality was not as good as his other DVDs. All in all my husband and I always LOVE Eddie. We would like to see him get some leading rolls in film.

Kopian,"[85, 104]","I'm writing this two months before the release of the DVD and I'm posting this so people will have an idea as to what this is since its not clear.This appears to be a version of Eddie Izzard's show Sexie from 2003 which was never released on DVD here in the US (This was taken at different performances of the show). This is probably a good thing since the region 2 DVD of Sexie seems to be Eddie on an off nightI saw the Sexie show a couple of times when it played live in the US and it really was a mixed bag. the first night I saw it I found it absolutely hysterically funny. The second night was less as good. The import DVD wasn't all that good. Much of the material performed has to do with Eddie's film career and when it works its very funny. I'm guessing that this is going to be worth picking up for any one who is a fan of Eddie's stand up because many of the bits are choice even if the show over all isn't great. Besides even allowing that this was recorded at a different series of shows than the original DVD, Eddie's shows are never the same, he's always changing bits, indeed even his recorded shows are never the same with the audio tape, CDs and video recordings of his early shows all being different.(Thank you to Auntie Momo at Cake or Death for seconding my suspicions)",3,Another version of Sexie,1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,1292,"[""'m"", 'writing', 'two', 'months', 'release', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'posting', 'so', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'not', 'clear.This', 'be', 'version', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'show', 'Sexie', '2003', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'DVD', 'here', 'US', 'was', 'taken', 'different', 'performances', 'show', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'region', '2', 'DVD', 'Sexie', 'be', 'Eddie', 'off', 'nightI', 'saw', 'Sexie', 'show', 'couple', 'times', 'when', 'played', 'live', 'US', 'really', 'was', 'mixed', 'bag', 'first', 'night', 'saw', 'found', 'absolutely', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'second', 'night', 'was', 'less', 'good', 'import', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'Much', 'material', 'performed', 'do', 'Eddie', 'film', 'career', 'when', 'very', 'funny', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'going', 'be', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'one', 'who', 'fan', 'Eddie', 'stand', 'up', 'because', 'many', 'bits', 'are', 'choice', 'even', 'show', ""n't"", 'great', 'even', 'allowing', 'was', 'recorded', 'different', 'series', 'shows', 'original', 'DVD', 'Eddie', 'shows', 'are', 'never', 'same', 'always', 'changing', 'bits', 'indeed', 'even', 'recorded', 'shows', 'are', 'never', 'same', 'audio', 'tape', 'CDs', 'video', 'recordings', 'early', 'shows', 'being', 'different', 'Thank', 'Auntie', 'Momo', 'Cake', 'Death', 'seconding', 'suspicions']",Eddie Izzard: Live from Wembley
