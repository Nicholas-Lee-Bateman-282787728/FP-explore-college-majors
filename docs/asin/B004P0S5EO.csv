A current boyfriend (Jang Hyuk) tries to explain why she can't sustain a relationship as he walks away.  Rather than own up to her weaknesses, she wreaks havoc on the three past boyfriends.

However, the remainder of the story of her efforts to get even with the men fell flat.Actress Kim Sun Ah makes even the ineffective scenes tolerable (that's her as the 3 women on the DVD cover -- assuming the DVD pic is of 3 women in bed). She falls in love better than most actresses, suffers better than most, and has an appealing comic touch (even when mugging).The films a visual treat, too. Surprisingly, it's the first film for the director and the cinematographer.",3,Kim Sun Ah and visuals,1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,566,"['So-so', 'romantic', 'comedy/drama', 'liked', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'depicting', 'woman', '3', 'relationships', 'However', 'remainder', 'story', 'efforts', 'get', 'even', 'men', 'fell', 'flat.Actress', 'Kim', 'Sun', 'Ah', 'even', 'ineffective', 'scenes', 'tolerable', '3', 'women', 'DVD', 'cover', 'assuming', 'DVD', 'pic', '3', 'women', 'bed', 'love', 'better', 'most', 'actresses', 'suffers', 'better', 'most', 'appealing', 'comic', 'touch', 'even', 'when', 'mugging', '.The', 'films', 'visual', 'treat', 'too', 'Surprisingly', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'cinematographer']",N/A
