876755,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,B00074DY6G,a voice of reason,"[5, 7]","Whether or not you enjoy this movie will likely depend on the following two things: 1)Do you require a lot of action in your movies? If so, this one is not for you. 2) Do you enjoy movies about people and relationships (a 'chick flick' to give it a name, although I think this tag too often turns off people who might still like a movie)? If so, you may enjoy this one. The reason I only say ""may"" is because this is a movie with a cause - to stop the needless development of farmland - and the cause at times takes over the whole movie (and I say that in spite of the fact that this is a cause I can certainly get behind).Beyond this one flaw, however, I enjoyed the scenery and the character development. I did think that it was unnecessary - maudlin, actually - to have the possibly HIV-positive storyline with Kimberly Norris Guerrero's character come up halfway through the movie. Her visiting out of pure nostalgia would have suited me just fine and would still have been quite believable.I recommend this one if you want to feel like you've spent a couple of hours in a beautiful and quiet area of the country with some good friends.",4,"The cause almost takes over, but the movie still succeeds",1157068800,"09 1, 2006",2006,1140,"['Whether', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'will', 'likely', 'depend', 'following', 'two', 'things', '1', 'Do', 'require', 'lot', 'action', 'movies', 'so', 'one', 'not', '2', 'Do', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'people', 'relationships', ""'chick"", 'flick', 'give', 'name', 'think', 'tag', 'too', 'often', 'off', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'still', 'like', 'movie', 'so', 'may', 'enjoy', 'one', 'reason', 'only', 'say', 'may', 'movie', 'cause', 'stop', 'needless', 'development', 'farmland', 'cause', 'times', 'whole', 'movie', 'say', 'spite', 'fact', 'cause', 'can', 'certainly', 'get', '.Beyond', 'one', 'flaw', 'however', 'enjoyed', 'scenery', 'character', 'development', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'maudlin', 'actually', 'have', 'possibly', 'HIV-positive', 'storyline', 'Kimberly', 'Norris', 'Guerrero', 'character', 'come', 'up', 'halfway', 'movie', 'visiting', 'pure', 'nostalgia', 'would', 'have', 'suited', 'just', 'fine', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'believable.I', 'recommend', 'one', 'want', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'couple', 'hours', 'beautiful', 'quiet', 'area', 'country', 'good', 'friends']",Barn Red

He exudes the type of all-American nobility that is more myth than reality, but the movie never depicts him as a caricature. Scenes of him cooking and baking, for instance, show that he's not your stereotypical 'farm boy.'Guerrero is equally convincing and ""real."" Although attractive, her beauty never draws primary attention or makes her simply another pretty face. She's smart, compassionate, and comes with a complete set of personal issues that give her character dimension.The villain is the only weak character, comical to the point of absurdity. Sadly, in real life, developers are usually far more clever and effective in manipulating zoning laws and come with an army of lawyers in tow. But that's a minor flaw in the film.As a resident of Oregon, which is in the midst of a land use crisis, the issues explored in this film are close to my heart. Yes, I recognized that the real purpose of the movie was to promote proper land use policies, and I think it worked on that level. But it also worked on the level of good entertainment with people we care about and can root for.I applaud all those involved in making this movie and recommend it.",4,A somewhat unpolished gem,1194652800,"11 10, 2007",2007,1807,"['denying', 'film', 'polish', 'major', 'studio', 'release', 'heartfelt', 'charm', 'sincerity', 'absense', 'theatrical', 'slickness', 'true', 'benefit.The', 'acting', 'may', 'be', 'uneven', 'rough', 'times', 'giving', 'look', 'dramatization', 'end', 'result', 'remarkably', 'realism', 'other', 'films', 'seem', 'artificial', 'contrived.I', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'film', 'appeared', 'be', 'made', 'amateurs', 'only', 'true', 'sense', 'word', 'one', 'who', 'something', 'love', 'rather', 'money.Borgnine', 'who', 'talent', 'always', 'been', 'greatly', 'undervalued', 'perfect', 'aging', 'farmer', 'facing', 'world', 'pushing', 'sell', 'farm', 'type', 'all-American', 'nobility', 'more', 'myth', 'reality', 'movie', 'never', 'caricature', 'Scenes', 'cooking', 'baking', 'instance', 'show', 'not', 'stereotypical', ""'farm"", 'boy', ""'Guerrero"", 'equally', 'convincing', 'real', 'attractive', 'beauty', 'never', 'primary', 'attention', 'simply', 'pretty', 'face', 'smart', 'compassionate', 'complete', 'set', 'personal', 'issues', 'give', 'character', 'dimension.The', 'villain', 'only', 'weak', 'character', 'comical', 'point', 'absurdity', 'Sadly', 'real', 'life', 'developers', 'are', 'usually', 'far', 'more', 'clever', 'effective', 'manipulating', 'zoning', 'laws', 'come', 'army', 'lawyers', 'tow', 'minor', 'flaw', 'film.As', 'resident', 'Oregon', 'midst', 'land', 'use', 'crisis', 'issues', 'explored', 'film', 'are', 'close', 'heart', 'Yes', 'recognized', 'real', 'purpose', 'movie', 'was', 'promote', 'proper', 'land', 'use', 'policies', 'think', 'worked', 'level', 'also', 'worked', 'level', 'good', 'entertainment', 'people', 'care', 'can', 'root', 'for.I', 'applaud', 'involved', 'making', 'movie', 'recommend']",Barn Red

I read his book and he has no intentions of quitting. Kimberly Guearro was great. I am now a huge fan of hers. The story line was very real and true. It is sad to think that maybe someday farms as we know them now will no longer exist.
