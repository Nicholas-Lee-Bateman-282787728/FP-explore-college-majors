On that point of view, the movie is remarkable.The main characters are one young man, Doug, and his sister who live together in Portland. Doug has started studying forensics but works for now in an ice factory. We meet one of his co-workers who is a part-time DJ and Rachel, an old girlfriend of Doug.The girlfriend gets into some trouble we know nothing about and disappears. It is a misdirection. One expect that she will be murdered and that Doug will use his freshly acquired forensic talents to discover the murderer, all this under the dark grey skies of Portland. But it is not the story at all. Doug has very little talent of observation and no forensic talent at all. It makes sense as he probably has learned from textbooks and has no practical experience, so he would not consider calling the police or wear gloves to protect the evidence.The first thing he does is to buy a pipe to be like Sherlock Holmes ""because it is going to help him think"". That scene won me over. So 20 minutes into the film, I finally got what it was about: it is about this uncertain age...So the mystery takes an unexpected direction; it is solved just like young people would solve it.The movie has charm and is hard to forget. It suffers from very poor editing. I do not mind a slow movie at all, if the characters are interesting, but here the rhythms are all wrong: it starts too slow and ends too fast. I feel that the photography is not quite in tune with the intention and should be more intimate.Maybe the next movie by the same people will be a great classic.

Or, the near ending scene where the soon to be victim is in a restaurant with an important briefcase inches from him and some girl walks up to the briefcase, grabs it and runs out the door, tosses it to another person, then runs around the car, gets in and drives a half block before said victim makes it out the door is like - sure, whatever!Third, an obvious give-away to poor directing/writing is when the victim's car is being followed about a block or two behind (mostly no other cars around) and for multiple turns over miles and that person is clueless about being followed?? Even more surprising is when it happens more than once.Fourth, the ending was like having bought one big firework for The Fourth and it doesn't go off.

1436494,AWN6ZMWWMUWLX,B0051CSIK6,J. Friday,"[0, 4]","Watching this movie felt as if I was watching a 3-legged tortoise trying to win a 100-meter dash. It's a slow, boring experience. But I kept watching this flick because I felt sorry for this turtle of a movie. I wanted to like it. It seemed like an honest effort straight from the heart. But it was just too slow.Acting: dull and lifeless. When the characters have their plodding dialogue, it's believable. When the characters are trying to show anger or fear, it is amateurish.Camera-work: shaky-cam. When the characters are running, the cameraman is running behind them. As a result, the shaky-cam gets really bad. There's even shaky-cam when the characters are sitting down on a bed. Why?Music: reminded me of Mark Mothersbaugh's music in Wes Anderson's Rushmore. In fact, I'm sure this movie was really influenced by Rushmore. Except this movie wasn't trying to be humorous. If it had been a comedy, I might have been able to forgive all the weak dialogue.Pacing: This movie was extremely slow. Why do we need boring shots of library shelves? Why do I need two minute shots of characters eating on a bench 50 yards away? Why do I need shots of lamp posts? How many scenes do we need where the character does nothing but sleep? How many shots of Portland, Oregon though a soggy windshield do we need to see?Although this movie isn't as aggravatingly tedious as Vincent Gallo's the Brown Bunny, the pace of this movie was idiotically slow. I am dead serious when I say this: you could actually skip the first 35 minutes of this movie and miss nothing. Seriously. If you watch this movie, skip to the 35 minute mark. In fact, this movie should have been a 30-40 minute short. It would have been much better that way. Nothing happens before 35 minutes. There isn't any character establishment whatsoever. The characters in this movie were lifeless. They had no motivation, no ambition, no drive, and no direction. As a result, the audience didn't have any reason to care about them. What a waste.P.S. I don't give a crap whether you like this movie or not, you have to admit the ending was a big letdown. Even though I was happy this slow movie finally ended, I had to say, ""That's all? You're gonna end it like that? Really?"" It seems like the director got bored with the movie in the end and just turned off the camera. Either that or he ran out of batteries, couldn't get enough money to buy new batteries, and said, ""Screw it. I'm just gonna show it off with that pointless ending. I'm sure by that time most people will be too bored to care.""",1,Cold Weather Leaves You Cold,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,2547,"['Watching', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', '3-legged', 'tortoise', 'trying', 'win', '100-meter', 'dash', 'slow', 'boring', 'experience', 'kept', 'watching', 'flick', 'felt', 'sorry', 'turtle', 'movie', 'wanted', 'seemed', 'honest', 'effort', 'straight', 'heart', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'slow.Acting', 'dull', 'lifeless', 'When', 'characters', 'have', 'plodding', 'dialogue', 'believable', 'When', 'characters', 'are', 'trying', 'show', 'anger', 'fear', 'amateurish.Camera-work', 'shaky-cam', 'When', 'characters', 'are', 'running', 'cameraman', 'running', 'result', 'shaky-cam', 'really', 'bad', 'even', 'shaky-cam', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'sitting', 'down', 'bed', 'Why', 'Music', 'reminded', 'Mark', 'Mothersbaugh', 'music', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Rushmore', 'fact', ""'m"", 'sure', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'influenced', 'Rushmore', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'humorous', 'had', 'been', 'comedy', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'forgive', 'weak', 'dialogue.Pacing', 'movie', 'was', 'extremely', 'slow', 'Why', 'do', 'need', 'boring', 'shots', 'library', 'shelves', 'Why', 'do', 'need', 'two', 'minute', 'shots', 'characters', 'eating', 'bench', '50', 'yards', 'away', 'Why', 'do', 'need', 'shots', 'lamp', 'posts', 'How', 'many', 'scenes', 'do', 'need', 'where', 'character', 'nothing', 'sleep', 'How', 'many', 'shots', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'soggy', 'windshield', 'do', 'need', 'see', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'aggravatingly', 'tedious', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'pace', 'movie', 'was', 'idiotically', 'slow', 'am', 'dead', 'serious', 'when', 'say', 'could', 'actually', 'skip', 'first', '35', 'minutes', 'movie', 'miss', 'nothing', 'Seriously', 'watch', 'movie', 'skip', '35', 'minute', 'mark', 'fact', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', '30-40', 'minute', 'short', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'way', 'Nothing', '35', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'character', 'establishment', 'whatsoever', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'lifeless', 'had', 'motivation', 'ambition', 'drive', 'direction', 'result', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'reason', 'care', 'What', 'waste.P.S', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'crap', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'admit', 'ending', 'was', 'big', 'letdown', 'Even', 'was', 'happy', 'slow', 'movie', 'finally', 'ended', 'had', 'say', ""'re"", 'gon', 'end', 'Really', 'director', 'got', 'bored', 'movie', 'end', 'just', 'turned', 'off', 'camera', 'ran', 'batteries', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'money', 'buy', 'new', 'batteries', 'said', 'Screw', ""'m"", 'just', 'gon', 'show', 'off', 'pointless', 'ending', ""'m"", 'sure', 'time', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'bored', 'care']",Cold Weather
1436495,A35I428M5WAT5Q,B0051CSIK6,"Joseph Kohout Jr. ""The Art of War""","[0, 1]","SPOILERS:I can appreciate art house (low budget movies).  Special effects traded for character development, multiple locations traded for quirkiness, dialog and wit, etc.  I had high hopes for Cold Weather after seeing the Rotten Tomatoes review and reading the synopsis on Wiki.  Unfortunately, it fell flat on many levelsBrother comes home to Portland from Chicago taking a hiatus from school and moving in with his sister.  Brother takes a job working the night shift at an Ice House.  Brother meets Carlos at the Ice House who is also a part time DJ.  Brother's ex-girlfriend from Chicago comes to Portland seemingly for job training since taking a job as a Paralegal in Chicago with a law firm headquartered in Portland.In concert with the synopsis above:Brother and sister are both seemingly without many friends and seem to be almost morose.  Without giving away too much of the plot, the ex-girlfriend disappears and is apparently not a Paralegal.What I didn't like:1.) The humor is all deadpan and while this would not normally be a problem for me, I just didn't find it all that amusing2.) There is no back-story re: why the ex is in fact an ex?3.) While I found the brother's connection to Sherlock Holmes interesting, it was not developed enough4.) There are long pauses which didn't seem to go anywhereIn summary, I thought that the outline was great, though there was simply not enough done with it.  I didn't find the mystery aspect all that interesting, the dialogue was not overly witty or profound and the character relationships were not explored with enough depth.  I got the sense that the brother/sister relationship was near oedipal in nature (I.E. he made her mixed tapes in HS and she was uncomfortable talking about dating) and this could have been explored further.To reiterate, I can appreciate a character or dialogue driven Indy/Art House movie (I.E. Swingers, Clerks, Open Water, Supersize Me, etc.).  However, this just didn't work for me, so perhaps I would file it under YMMV.",3,Had High Hopes.

Given the `polar vortex' that we have gone through recently, how appropriate it would be to watch a movie called ""Cold Weather""!""Cold Weather"" (2010 release; 96 min.) brings the story of Doug (played by Cris Lankenau) and Gail (played by Trieste Kelly Dunn). As the movie opens, we see them having dinner with what turns out to be their parents. Indeed Doug and Gail are brother and sister, with Doug having moved in recently with her in Portland, OR. He has stopped his CSI-like forensic studies, and eventually takes a job at an ice factory. There, Doug becomes friends with a co-worker named Carlos. And Doug also runs into Rachel, an ex-girlfriend who has come for Chicago for work purposes. The four of them all get along great, and Carlos even develops a crush on Rachel. Then late one evening, a distraught Carlos comes to Doug's apartment, telling him Rachel didn't show up for a date. Doug now can use his limited experience in forensics to help his friend, and believes himself to be the next Sherlock Holmes. What has happened to Rachel? At this point we a good 30-35 min. into the movie, and to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience.Couple of comments: first, this movie must be a labor of love from writer-director-editor and co-producer Aaron Katz. The movie is made on a shoestring basis, if that much. But it doesn't stop Katz from setting us up with a decent mystery-thriller. Second, the movie is set in Portland, and the Portland scenery plays as much a character in the movie as any of the lead stars. Third, the movie plays out nicely, that is until the very end, which came abrupt and left me scratching my head, to be honest. Fourth, there are some interesting DVD bonus materials. I immediately checked out the ""Alternative Ending"", but that didn't do much more for me either. Far better is the live performance (taped in Nashville) of the movie soundtrack's End Titles by the composer and an ensemble of about 10 live performers.Bottom line: this is a bare-bones, indie mystery-thriller that plays out well for the most part, even if the ending doesn't really deliver.

(Well, unless you consider stacking bags of ice ""something"")Then one of them gets in some trouble and (although WE never get to see it) leaves some kind of cryptic clue about it that the others soon figure out, even though there is no good reason why the person in trouble couldn't, simply, have TOLD the others!Anyway.The other three solve the problem by, basically, doing nothing more than (SPOILER ALERT) running into a restaurant, stealing a ""package"" and running away.They ARE NOT CHASED! They are NOT CAUGHT! They are in ABSOLUTELY NO DANGER WHATSOEVER!And so, the film stops.It doesn't END (How could it? It never began!)

It also looked like a promising detective film filled with mystery and intrigue. ""Cold Weather"" just failed to deliver the goods. The story follows Doug, a directionless 20 something who moves in with his sister. Doug has chosen to abandon his dreams of being a detective and elects to work in an ice packing factory until he ""figures things out"".Later on, his ex girlfriend comes to visit him and they have a pleasant time catching up. Things soon take a troubling turn when she fails to turn up for friend's Dj gig. Doug springs into action and uses her disappearance as a chance to use what he learned in forensic science class to find her. ""Cold Weather"" had a great opportunity to be a solid mystery movie but quickly became unfocused. Doug's forensic skills are barely displayed and the characters spend most of their time sitting in cars eating Swedish Fish. These long and pointless scenes could of been better utilized to create more depth to the plot but where instead wasted.I won't give anything away but the reason behind the disappearance was pretty lame and a tinny bit confusing. I spend most of my time being impatient and when all was said and done I asked myself ""..is that it?"" ""Cold Weather"" isn't a horrible movie by any means, and it worked for me on some level, but it seemed ultimately pointless. Watch it for some beautiful scenes of Portland and some mildly amusing banter, otherwise give ""Cold Weather"" the cold shoulder.",3,Falls flat.,1323043200,"12 5, 2011",2011,1591,"['wanted', 'so', 'much', 'like', 'film', 'Mostly', 'place', 'Portland', 'city', 'have', 'great', 'affection', 'affinity', 'towards', 'also', 'looked', 'promising', 'detective', 'film', 'filled', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'Cold', 'Weather', 'just', 'failed', 'deliver', 'goods', 'story', 'Doug', 'directionless', '20', 'something', 'who', 'sister', 'Doug', 'chosen', 'abandon', 'dreams', 'being', 'detective', 'elects', 'work', 'ice', 'packing', 'factory', 'figures', 'things', 'out', '.Later', 'ex', 'girlfriend', 'visit', 'have', 'pleasant', 'time', 'catching', 'up', 'Things', 'soon', 'take', 'troubling', 'turn', 'when', 'turn', 'up', 'friend', 'Dj', 'gig', 'Doug', 'springs', 'action', 'disappearance', 'chance', 'use', 'what', 'learned', 'forensic', 'science', 'class', 'find', 'Cold', 'Weather', 'had', 'great', 'opportunity', 'be', 'solid', 'mystery', 'movie', 'quickly', 'became', 'unfocused', 'Doug', 'forensic', 'skills', 'are', 'barely', 'displayed', 'characters', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'sitting', 'cars', 'eating', 'Swedish', 'Fish', 'long', 'pointless', 'scenes', 'could', 'been', 'better', 'utilized', 'create', 'more', 'depth', 'plot', 'where', 'instead', 'wasted.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'reason', 'disappearance', 'was', 'pretty', 'lame', 'tinny', 'bit', 'confusing', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'being', 'impatient', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'asked', 'Cold', 'Weather', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'movie', 'means', 'worked', 'level', 'seemed', 'ultimately', 'pointless', 'Watch', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'Portland', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'banter', 'otherwise', 'give', 'Cold', 'Weather', 'cold', 'shoulder']",Cold Weather

He takes a job at a ice factory, makes a friend, but mostly hangs out with his sister. The ""mystery"" starts once we get the gist of how small and insignificant the lives of all the characters are. I've been to Portland, Oregon a few times and I always leave in a somber mood, like I just heard that a friend from my childhood died suddenly but I haven't seen him in 20 years. It's always chilly, rainy, and, while the citizens seem eclectic enough, they are just wandering around in a purgatory of unemployment with neo-folk music as the soundtrack. The scenery is beautiful but it's always damp and always cloudy. You wait for that sunny day that will dry out the clouds and lighten the shadows but, like this movie, it never comes. Before you know it, your 50, the movie has ended, and so has your worthless life.",2,Ahh Portland,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,948,"['Skip', 'first', '35', 'minutes', 'just', 'empty', 'protagonist', 'criminal', 'justice', 'degree', 'interest', 'criminal', 'justice', 'job', 'ice', 'factory', 'friend', 'mostly', 'out', 'sister', 'mystery', 'once', 'get', 'gist', 'how', 'small', 'insignificant', 'lives', 'characters', 'are', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'few', 'times', 'always', 'leave', 'somber', 'mood', 'just', 'heard', 'friend', 'childhood', 'died', 'suddenly', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', '20', 'years', 'always', 'chilly', 'rainy', 'citizens', 'seem', 'eclectic', 'enough', 'are', 'just', 'wandering', 'around', 'purgatory', 'unemployment', 'neo-folk', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'always', 'damp', 'always', 'cloudy', 'wait', 'sunny', 'day', 'will', 'dry', 'out', 'clouds', 'lighten', 'shadows', 'movie', 'never', 'know', '50', 'movie', 'ended', 'so', 'worthless', 'life']",Cold Weather
