308205,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302338425,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I love James Caan, and I have this thing for Bette Midler (the same thing I have for Barbara Streisand apparently) so I was kind of excited to watch `For the Boys'.  My cinephille friends who had seen the film were pessimistic and basically told me that I only needed to see it for the mere fact that Midler received an undeserved Oscar nomination and that I was most likely going to hate the film.I didn't.That isn't to say that I loved it or even really liked it, for there is a lot about this film that doesn't work, but it isn't loathsome and Midler's Oscar nomination is far from undeserved.  In fact, I actually found her more engaging, entertaining and deserving than the actual Oscar winner that year (but my relationship with Jodie Foster is not a good one).  Still, as much as I didn't hate this, and as much as I found both Midler and Caan good in their respective roles, there is just too much about `For the Boys' that misses the mark.Midler plays a singer named Dixie Leonard who gets picked up by Eddie Sparks, a showman who wants her for a USO tour during World War II.  Together, they make an odd pair.  Dixie is fearless and sassy and sexy and literally throws caution to the wind while giving the `boys' exactly what they want, while Eddie is initially turned off by her crude humor and undeniable appeal.  The two barrel through their differences and create a force that spans fifty years and remains tumultuous throughout.Here is where the film gets sticky.  I mean, you are covering a lot of ground and basically focusing on two people solely.  The script doesn't truly flesh out these characters as a `couple' and so the audience isn't necessarily drawn to them in that light.  The whole thing feels rather anti-climactic, even though it is certainly going to the climactic.  It wants you to be moved to tears when these two are finally reunited, but by the time Dixie is done telling her story you are pretty much removed from her plight and could care less if she and Eddie ever see one another again.  The pretty simple resolve of all things negative is also a tad unrealistic and gives the film a sense of pointlessness, like the feud and obvious reservations, especially on Dixie's end, were unnecessary.  Also, the span of time gets in the way because it tries to tell is so much but the reflective nature of the film (focusing on that relationship) almost gives it a redundancy, which hurts the film considering that it feels like a hodgepodge of scenes which serve no purpose but to remind us that Dixie and Eddie don't get along but can't live without each other.And still, Midler is explosive and engaging and just so much fun to watch.  Her voice, her sass, her complete control of her environment is stunning to witness and I would recommend watching it for her and her alone.  Caan is very good and holds his own, but his character is certainly not as entertaining as that of Dixie.Still, the mediocre direction and the poor scripting (and that god-awful makeup) make this film less that it could have been.",3,See it for Midler...,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,3043,"['love', 'James', 'Caan', 'have', 'thing', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'same', 'thing', 'have', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'apparently', 'so', 'was', 'kind', 'excited', 'watch', 'Boys', 'cinephille', 'friends', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'were', 'pessimistic', 'basically', 'told', 'only', 'needed', 'see', 'mere', 'fact', 'Midler', 'received', 'undeserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'going', 'hate', 'film.I', ""didn't.That"", ""n't"", 'say', 'loved', 'even', 'really', 'liked', 'lot', 'film', ""n't"", 'work', ""n't"", 'loathsome', 'Midler', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'far', 'undeserved', 'fact', 'actually', 'found', 'more', 'engaging', 'entertaining', 'deserving', 'actual', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'year', 'relationship', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'not', 'good', 'one', 'Still', 'as', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'as', 'much', 'found', 'Midler', 'Caan', 'good', 'respective', 'roles', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'Boys', 'mark.Midler', 'singer', 'named', 'Dixie', 'Leonard', 'who', 'picked', 'up', 'Eddie', 'Sparks', 'showman', 'who', 'USO', 'tour', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Together', 'make', 'odd', 'pair', 'Dixie', 'fearless', 'sassy', 'sexy', 'literally', 'caution', 'wind', 'giving', 'boys', 'exactly', 'what', 'want', 'Eddie', 'initially', 'turned', 'off', 'crude', 'humor', 'undeniable', 'appeal', 'two', 'barrel', 'differences', 'create', 'force', 'fifty', 'years', 'tumultuous', 'where', 'film', 'sticky', 'mean', 'are', 'covering', 'lot', 'ground', 'basically', 'focusing', 'two', 'people', 'solely', 'script', ""n't"", 'truly', 'flesh', 'characters', 'couple', 'audience', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'drawn', 'light', 'whole', 'thing', 'feels', 'rather', 'anti-climactic', 'even', 'certainly', 'going', 'climactic', 'be', 'moved', 'tears', 'when', 'two', 'are', 'finally', 'reunited', 'time', 'Dixie', 'done', 'telling', 'story', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'removed', 'plight', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'Eddie', 'ever', 'see', 'one', 'again', 'pretty', 'simple', 'resolve', 'things', 'negative', 'also', 'tad', 'unrealistic', 'film', 'sense', 'pointlessness', 'feud', 'obvious', 'reservations', 'especially', 'Dixie', 'end', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'Also', 'span', 'time', 'way', 'tell', 'so', 'much', 'reflective', 'nature', 'film', 'focusing', 'relationship', 'almost', 'redundancy', 'film', 'considering', 'hodgepodge', 'scenes', 'serve', 'purpose', 'remind', 'Dixie', 'Eddie', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'other.And', 'still', 'Midler', 'explosive', 'engaging', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'Her', 'voice', 'sass', 'complete', 'control', 'environment', 'stunning', 'witness', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'alone', 'Caan', 'very', 'good', 'own', 'character', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'entertaining', 'Dixie.Still', 'mediocre', 'direction', 'poor', 'scripting', 'god-awful', 'makeup', 'make', 'film', 'less', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A

Who is Tom Keogh; a clown from the circus ???This movie deserved many awards, but as POLITICS goes in Hollywood, anything that has to do with (or even mentions) the Jewish faith, African-American heritage or The Gay Community takes a BACK SEAT on the Hollywood awards band wagon (Examples: FOR THE BOYS, JULIA, TORCHSONG TRILOGY, BENT, THE COLOR PURPLE and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN) !!!This production was well done and the story has VERY DEEP MEANING.  The characters of Dixie and Eddie are fighting battles throughout, but any FOOL can see that Dixie and Eddie really loved each other, deep down inside.  They are blaming each other for the bad times and not thinking about the good times. Their chemistry problems actually made them MORE POPULAR !!!This movie also shows a lot about entertaining the troops and the conflicts involved with the dangers of war being all around them.  What a sacrifice these entertainers make to cheer up the troops as they endanger their own lives.  This movie is a good tribute to those who have traveled with the USO tours, like Bob Hope and many others.I do not know who Tom Keogh is and have never heard any RAVES about his experience with the motion picture industry, but from his review, I would say he is a prejudice beginner with a POOR ATTITUDE and NO INTELLIGENCE !!!  I am a avid movie watcher, fairly intelligent and have no college degree in the motion picture sciences, but I do recognize a good production when I see it.I say ""FOR THE BOYS"" is a GREAT MOVIE EXPERIENCE and I give it a star rating of FIVE (5) !!!!  I recommend this movie as a GREAT MOTION PICTURE; that deserves to be seen by all. I suggest that Tom Keogh look at his life and stop trying to be something he is NOT !!!

Well, I believe I have at least, but, people are strange critters so who knows.  Was this written from a script of Martha Raye's life story and reworked or based on anyone's?  Is some of the music from the wrong time period?  Other goofs?  It's wrong to analyze anything to death and that's what happened with this film when it was released.  I ADORE Martha Raye and for one hope there is no truth in that gossip.  I LOVE this film and am pleased it was made regardless of whether it was even remotely true or not.  Was the music from the wrong time period?  I think someone is entirely TOO critical if they worry about that minute detail.  Even if the song was played in its entirety in the film, it's not THE WHOLE film just a few minutes of it and all the songs worked!  I LOVED it!  If it had anything to do with anyone's life, living or dead, this is a dramatization of an era.  It should feel real, but, needn't be 100% so.  This is the story of two entertainers, how they met, formed a team, their ups and downs and the tragedies they shared through three wars.  It touches my heart to watch this woman's story.

The premise of two show-biz veterans, who have a love/hate (mostly hate) relationship, through 50 years of entertaining together in the  U.S.O., television, amid changing public tastes, tragedies, ups, downs, wars, etc...should have made for a very entertaining saga. And, with Bette Midler as the musical female lead, how could it miss? Well, it did. Though it gets off to a promising start, and her number ""Stuff Like That There"" early in the film brings down the house in true Bette style, it went downhill from there. James Caan is opposite her as her sexist partner/nemesis, whose  pairing with her, though a big success career wise, is rife with rivalry and contempt for the very success that the fluke of their pairing produces. They chew the scenery often, and certain scenes,  such as when Bette's characters son is killed in front of her in VietNam, where she is entertaining,  that are so stupidly overwrought that they are rendered emotionless. I actually went to a theater to see this movie, something I don't often do. What I still remember most about that experience is the collective audience reaction, of incredulous hilarity, when the ""aged"" Midler and Caan's characters meet after many years of non-communication for a begrudged public reunion. This is by far the worst ""aging"" make-up job that I have ever seen in a big budget motion picture... all the improbability of this movie came to a ridiculous head at the viewing of these supposed very elderly stars, who look more like burn victims, in mid-meltdown, than any elderly person I've ever known.

Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 5]","Seemingly suggested by a combination of Bob Hope's legendary USO tours and the toxic relationship that sometimes develops between comedy team partners (with the likes of Martin and Lewis a case in point), FOR THE BOYS gives us the story of Dixie Leonard (Midler), a rough and tough singer with a naughty sense of humor, and Eddie Sparks (James Caan), a secretly sexist comic.  When the two meet on a World War II USO tour, it's loathing at first sight--but their audiences adore the combination.Trouble is, you can't imagine why.  Both Midler and Caan are expert performers, but they have remarkably little on-screen chemistry, and although they score points individually they never quite seem to be working in tandem.  To make matters worse, while the dialogue is often witty, the plot is leaden, and it promptly goes off into a host of predictable directions as it drags its characters from World War II to Vietnam in order to make a series of well-intended but extremely obvious and over-worked comments about changing times and the wastefulness of war.The supporting cast is strong, but like the leads they seem to be pulling in different directions throughout the film, and when all is said and done this rather lengthy film feels quite a bit longer than it actually is.  Midler's songs are the only real highlight, and the thing is indeed watchable... but only just.  The DVD package isn't anything to write home about either, consisting of a handful of trailers and television spots.

308224,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,6302338425,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[6, 6]","For the Boys is truly an underrated gem. Spanning a period of 50 years and three different wars, the film tells the story of Dixie Leonard (the Divine Mrs. M), a singer who is plucked from semi-obscurity at the outset of World War II and given her big break: A USO tour of Europe with Eddie Sparks (James Caan), a song-and-dance man who's a famous star. Their first time on the stage together, Dixie steals the show, Eddie tries to fire her, and they're off and running. Through thick and thin - North Africa, the Korean war, television, McCarthyism, Vietnam - they fight and make up while the world applauds, and finally there's a climax on a live TV awards show, where Dixie and Eddie are seeing each other for the first time in years.Bette Midler is truly fantastic in her role as Dixie. The first USO musical number is a great success, with Bette trading risque repartee with Caan and then belting out a loud number and a ballad.  She has a beautiful voice, powerful and bursting with emotion. This part was written for Bette, no one else could have played Dixie quite like her. She was once again robbed at the Oscars that year, losing to non other than Jodie Foster for the terribly overrated Silence of the Lambs. Midler's performance was much more dramatic and real, and she deserved that statuette.I am not a big fan of James Caan, but he was good in the film. He had a certain chemistry with Midler that made his character believable. Sparks isn't a particularly likeable soul, but Caan brings a certain charm to a role that's tailor-made for his talents. He's right at home with Eddie's emotional isolation and single-minded ambition, bringing to mind a used-car salesman who discovers that the marks are actually buying his manufactured sincerity. The script has no intention of guiding him down the road to redemption, but the occasional showdowns with his conscience add a human touch that allows us to tolerate (if not entirely enjoy) his company for the duration.The film is full of cliches, yes, but seriously, what movie isn't. And are we really expected to believe these guys are so famous that 50 million people are going to tune in to their awards ceremony? Probably not,  and yet, despite it all, there are moments when you might find yourself moved beyond reasonable expectation. The first 40 minutes are terrific, and while the rest of the film never quite manages to hold onto that unbdeniable magic, it remains an entertaining and touching experience.Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the singing and dancing occupy a surprisingly brief portion of the 140 minute running time. There is a lot of story to tell and not much time to tell it. Encapsulating an entire life in a couple of hours is always a dicey proposition, but our innate awareness that the years are slipping by makes us naturally receptive to a film that follows its characters from the comparative optimism of early middle age to the long nights at the end of the line. The transitions are sweeping (fifteen years here, twenty-five there), sacrificing a coherent whole for a series of snapshots, but there's enough here to provide us with an investment in the outcome. Every misstep is matched by a finely tuned observation on the human condition and it works its way to a manipulative but undeniably emotional climax that could conceivably end in tears.",5,"Not for everybody, but truly fantastic!!!!",1092873600,"08 19, 2004",2004,3349,"['Boys', 'truly', 'underrated', 'gem', 'Spanning', 'period', '50', 'years', 'three', 'different', 'wars', 'film', 'story', 'Dixie', 'Leonard', 'Divine', 'Mrs.', 'M', 'singer', 'who', 'plucked', 'semi-obscurity', 'outset', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'given', 'big', 'break', 'USO', 'tour', 'Europe', 'Eddie', 'Sparks', 'James', 'Caan', 'song-and-dance', 'man', 'who', 'famous', 'star', 'first', 'time', 'stage', 'together', 'Dixie', 'show', 'Eddie', 'fire', ""'re"", 'running', 'thick', 'thin', 'North', 'Africa', 'Korean', 'war', 'television', 'McCarthyism', 'Vietnam', 'fight', 'make', 'up', 'world', 'applauds', 'finally', 'climax', 'live', 'TV', 'awards', 'show', 'where', 'Dixie', 'Eddie', 'are', 'seeing', 'other', 'first', 'time', 'years.Bette', 'Midler', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'role', 'Dixie', 'first', 'USO', 'musical', 'number', 'great', 'success', 'Bette', 'trading', 'risque', 'repartee', 'Caan', 'then', 'belting', 'out', 'loud', 'number', 'ballad', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'powerful', 'bursting', 'emotion', 'part', 'was', 'written', 'Bette', 'one', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Dixie', 'quite', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'robbed', 'Oscars', 'year', 'losing', 'non', 'other', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'terribly', 'overrated', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Midler', 'performance', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'dramatic', 'real', 'deserved', 'statuette.I', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'James', 'Caan', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'had', 'certain', 'chemistry', 'Midler', 'made', 'character', 'believable', 'Sparks', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'likeable', 'soul', 'Caan', 'certain', 'charm', 'role', 'tailor-made', 'talents', 'right', 'home', 'Eddie', 'emotional', 'isolation', 'single-minded', 'ambition', 'bringing', 'mind', 'used-car', 'salesman', 'who', 'marks', 'are', 'actually', 'buying', 'manufactured', 'sincerity', 'script', 'intention', 'guiding', 'down', 'road', 'redemption', 'occasional', 'showdowns', 'conscience', 'add', 'human', 'touch', 'tolerate', 'not', 'entirely', 'enjoy', 'company', 'duration.The', 'film', 'full', 'cliches', 'yes', 'seriously', 'what', 'movie', ""n't"", 'are', 'really', 'expected', 'believe', 'guys', 'are', 'so', 'famous', '50', 'million', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'tune', 'awards', 'ceremony', 'Probably', 'not', 'yet', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'might', 'find', 'moved', 'reasonable', 'expectation', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'are', 'terrific', 'rest', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'hold', 'unbdeniable', 'magic', 'entertaining', 'touching', 'experience.Unfortunately', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'singing', 'dancing', 'occupy', 'surprisingly', 'brief', 'portion', '140', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'lot', 'story', 'tell', 'not', 'much', 'time', 'tell', 'Encapsulating', 'entire', 'life', 'couple', 'hours', 'always', 'dicey', 'proposition', 'innate', 'awareness', 'years', 'are', 'slipping', 'naturally', 'receptive', 'film', 'characters', 'comparative', 'optimism', 'early', 'middle', 'age', 'long', 'nights', 'end', 'line', 'transitions', 'are', 'sweeping', 'fifteen', 'years', 'here', 'twenty-five', 'there', 'sacrificing', 'coherent', 'whole', 'series', 'snapshots', 'enough', 'here', 'provide', 'investment', 'outcome', 'misstep', 'matched', 'finely', 'tuned', 'observation', 'human', 'condition', 'way', 'manipulative', 'undeniably', 'emotional', 'climax', 'could', 'conceivably', 'end', 'tears']",N/A

When I got done watching it, it became an instant favorite of mine. I had learned that this movie didn't get much recognition when it first came out, and that Bette was nominated for an Oscar (this was her second nomination). I feel that she should have won the award for her performance; why she didn't is anyone's guess. Again, this was the second time she was nominated for the award, and it was the second time she lost (her first nomination, in 1980, was for her role in The Rose). The story deals with Eddie Sparks (Caan) and Dixie Leonard (Midler), who do singing and comedy routines for the troops covering WWII, Korea, Vietnam, etc. They don't like each other a whole lot, but they manage to put aside their differences for the sake of their acts. I read where the critics complained about the aging makeup that Midler and Caan wore when playing their characters in old age. I thought the makeup was not bad. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Bette Midler's acting, and the soundtrack album is also highly recommended.

Along the way is the drama that they both experience as they try to court one another while James is still married. For Bette, this should have been another hit as it had a great song off the soundtrack which could have worked as a hit single EVERY ROAD LEADS BACK To YOU as well as a great performance.

I am as baffled today as I was upon its initial release that it did not do well. Bette (who has had an uneven movie career) is simply great here; brilliant. She SHOULD have won an Oscar. She is electric in her almost every scene. The early big number where she first sings for Eddie is magic, exhilarating, joyous, and a delight. Bette is at her very best in this long number. Even her hands and arms; watch what she does with them.The supporting players are also wonderful. I particularly enjoyed the subtly, grace, and charm displayed by Arye Gross (impossibly young!). The scenes in Vietnam with Christopher Rydell (as Bette's beloved movie son Danny) are also superbly played by the actor. You really feel the stunning transition from his pro-war beliefs to his shocking disillusionment.The brief Vietnam scenes also portray the hubris of Vietnam better than most feature-length films on the subject. No small achievement.What I also liked about the film was the utter disparity between the public's viewpoint of the two Beloved Stars and their own truth. I also enjoyed the many issues touched upon - no easy task to do in 138 minutes.Yes, there are problems.

Unlike her first Oscar nominated The Rose's depressing A La Janis Joplin spin off story that was too heavy to digest, For The Boys has the ability to be a comedy, musical, and tearjearker at the same time. Bette got another Oscar nomination for the role of Dixie Leonard.For The Boys takes you to journey in Dixie Leonard's memory lane across some 40 year span when she was being persuaded by a man from the awards organization to attend the gala event. At first, she refused to go knowing that Eddie Sparks(James Caan), her long time showbiz partner/lover would be there. Before she made up her mind wether to go or not, she started to tell the man about her career and life experiences.....A lot of happy, funny, and even tragic events happen in her flashbacks. In the beginning, Eddie Sparks didn't like her, but Dixie stole the show when they were entertaining the troops, and they became partners to go overseas to do shows for the boys fighting in the Vietnam and Korean wars. Dixie's husband died in the war, and she was devastated. Graudually, she and Eddie got intimate with each other, despite the fact that he was married with kids. More than ten years later, Dixie witnessed her only son died in the Vietnam War. She blamed it on Eddie, and never spoke to him again.The singing and dancing were dazzling, and there were many funny moments as well as moving moments, especially the scene when Dixie's son got killed by a bomb, and the scene when the aged Eddie gave his speech at the gala presentation. He was speechless when he talked about losing his boy(Dixie's son). That was a very moving point in this film, but it's not the actual ending. The reunion of Dixie and Eddie was the joyful and uplifting moment, because they forgave each other.James Caan was very good, he exudes the sophistication of old Hollywood entertainers, and he's a great pairing with Bette.This is my favorite Bette Midler movie of all time along with The Rose, and Beaches.",5,Bette's most entertaining movie!,1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,2072,"['like', 'see', 'Bette', 'sing', 'act', 'dance', 'cry', 'joke', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'fulfill', 'first', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Rose', 'depressing', 'A', 'La', 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'spin', 'off', 'story', 'was', 'too', 'heavy', 'digest', 'Boys', 'ability', 'be', 'comedy', 'musical', 'tearjearker', 'same', 'time', 'Bette', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'role', 'Dixie', 'Leonard.For', 'Boys', 'journey', 'Dixie', 'Leonard', 'memory', 'lane', '40', 'year', 'span', 'when', 'was', 'being', 'persuaded', 'man', 'awards', 'organization', 'attend', 'gala', 'event', 'first', 'refused', 'go', 'knowing', 'Eddie', 'Sparks', 'James', 'Caan', 'long', 'time', 'showbiz', 'partner/lover', 'would', 'be', 'there', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'wether', 'go', 'not', 'started', 'tell', 'man', 'career', 'life', 'experiences', '..A', 'lot', 'happy', 'funny', 'even', 'tragic', 'events', 'happen', 'flashbacks', 'beginning', 'Eddie', 'Sparks', 'did', ""n't"", 'Dixie', 'stole', 'show', 'when', 'were', 'entertaining', 'troops', 'became', 'partners', 'go', 'overseas', 'do', 'shows', 'boys', 'fighting', 'Vietnam', 'Korean', 'wars', 'Dixie', 'husband', 'died', 'war', 'was', 'devastated', 'Graudually', 'Eddie', 'got', 'intimate', 'other', 'fact', 'was', 'married', 'kids', 'More', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'Dixie', 'witnessed', 'only', 'son', 'died', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'blamed', 'Eddie', 'never', 'spoke', 'again.The', 'singing', 'dancing', 'were', 'dazzling', 'were', 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'moving', 'moments', 'especially', 'scene', 'when', 'Dixie', 'son', 'got', 'killed', 'bomb', 'scene', 'when', 'aged', 'Eddie', 'gave', 'speech', 'gala', 'presentation', 'was', 'speechless', 'when', 'talked', 'losing', 'boy', 'Dixie', 'son', 'was', 'very', 'moving', 'point', 'film', 'not', 'actual', 'ending', 'reunion', 'Dixie', 'Eddie', 'was', 'joyful', 'uplifting', 'moment', 'forgave', 'other.James', 'Caan', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'sophistication', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'entertainers', 'great', 'pairing', 'Bette.This', 'favorite', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'movie', 'time', 'Rose', 'Beaches']",N/A

The trailer featured Bette's character singing ""In My Life"" during the Vietnam War, while flashes of history are played on the screen.  Perhaps needless to say, I CRIED my eyes out while watching this!  It made me believe that the movie would be outstanding, or, at least, as emotional as that song.  Anyway, I was looking forward to seeing it, and bought it for cheap somewhere.AS USUAL I had to watch the movie a few times before I really started appreciating it, and now I can say that I love it, DESPITE the scathing reviews it received.  But I do agree on a few points:Unfortunately, the best part of the entire movie is the first forty minutes or so, and considering the movie is two-and-one-half hours long, that perhaps isn't saying much.  But watching Bette perform in these scenes is enough to sustain you throughout the rest.  Basically, you just wind up wishing the movie would ""pick up,"" but you're stuck waiting for the other half of a one-two punch; it never REALLY comes.The entire movie in itself IS emotional, cute, funny, tragic ... all the adjectives you'd expect.  But all of these things working together don't add up to a perfect whole.  And the ending is somewhat unsatisfying.  It's the ending we were expecting, but ... it could have been executed a bit better.  At times it seems as though it were a TV-movie.  And everyone complains about the age makeup, but ... this was 1990; this was ""For the Boys,"" not ""Lord of the Rings.""All-in-all it's the songs and one-liners that are going to stay with you, and, again, Bette's performance in those first forty minutes.  I guess I'm just biased, but ... I believe this movie DOES have an audience if you're open-minded, and can view this as a flawed masterpiece.  If you've read any entertainment ""news"" from 1991, then you'd know that Bette's own production company brought ""For the Boys"" to fruition, and it was truly a love-letter to all her fans.Maybe sometime before the 2000s are over she'll have one more big hit, and maybe she'll finally get an Oscar.  I hope.  :)",5,For this boy ...,1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,2171,"['Many', 'moons', 'received', 'DVD', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'was', 'trailer', 'included', 'special', 'features', 'Boys', 'trailer', 'featured', 'Bette', 'character', 'singing', 'My', 'Life', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'flashes', 'history', 'are', 'played', 'screen', 'Perhaps', 'needless', 'say', 'CRIED', 'eyes', 'out', 'watching', 'made', 'believe', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'outstanding', 'least', 'as', 'emotional', 'song', 'Anyway', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'bought', 'cheap', 'somewhere.AS', 'USUAL', 'had', 'watch', 'movie', 'few', 'times', 'really', 'started', 'appreciating', 'now', 'can', 'say', 'love', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'received', 'do', 'agree', 'few', 'points', 'Unfortunately', 'best', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'first', 'forty', 'minutes', 'so', 'considering', 'movie', 'two-and-one-half', 'hours', 'long', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'watching', 'Bette', 'perform', 'scenes', 'enough', 'sustain', 'rest', 'Basically', 'just', 'wind', 'up', 'wishing', 'movie', 'would', 'pick', 'up', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'waiting', 'other', 'half', 'one-two', 'punch', 'never', 'REALLY', 'comes.The', 'entire', 'movie', 'IS', 'emotional', 'cute', 'funny', 'tragic', 'adjectives', ""'d"", 'expect', 'things', 'working', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'perfect', 'whole', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'were', 'expecting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'executed', 'bit', 'better', 'times', 'were', 'TV-movie', 'everyone', 'complains', 'age', 'makeup', 'was', '1990', 'was', 'Boys', 'not', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'All-in-all', 'songs', 'one-liners', 'are', 'going', 'stay', 'again', 'Bette', 'performance', 'first', 'forty', 'minutes', 'guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'biased', 'believe', 'movie', 'DOES', 'have', 'audience', ""'re"", 'open-minded', 'can', 'view', 'flawed', 'masterpiece', ""'ve"", 'read', 'entertainment', 'news', '1991', 'then', ""'d"", 'know', 'Bette', 'own', 'production', 'company', 'brought', 'Boys', 'fruition', 'was', 'truly', 'love-letter', 'fans.Maybe', 'sometime', '2000s', 'are', ""'ll"", 'have', 'one', 'more', 'big', 'hit', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'finally', 'get', 'Oscar', 'hope']",N/A
