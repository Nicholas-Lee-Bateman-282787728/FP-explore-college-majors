1307511,A9VSDB7HJFMAO,B002ZG98J6,AJ Hayden,"[0, 1]","Personally, I thought Chris Columbus did a pretty good job with the first two Harry Potter movies. But this movie was terrible. It was absolutely NOTHING like the book.First, the appearance of the actors. They were way, way too old to be playing twelve-year-olds (the actress playing Annabeth was in her early twenties when they filmed this) and Percy was the only one who looked as his character was described in the book. Annabeth had brown hair and brown eyes and her personality was nothing like Annabeth's in the book. Annabeth could be a sometimes sarcastic know-it-all, but sweet. In this, she was a fierce warrior maiden and for most of the movie, pretty mean to Percy. Grover is supposed to be a redhead, awkward, gangly, but a good friend. In this movie, he had most of the attributes of a gangster. The only person who really was anything as they were in the book was Luke, but of course, being a good actor, he wasn't in it for very long.My main problem though is that so much changed form the book. I'm okay with a few changes, with some books they are necessary. But this movie was pretty much nothing like the book. The only thing they had similar was the title. If they are to continue with the rest of the series, they are going to have a hard time explaining what everything is because they skipped out on a lot(Spoilers ahead, if you don't want the movie ruined, don't read!)--Kronos was not so much as mentioned in this book, which I think is pretty important. He's the main bad guy and it's going to be hard to make the movie if they don't have the main antagonist.--Maybe this isn't really important, but they never mentioned Luke's scar, and it sort of stemmed his turning evil because he was mad at his father for giving him such a lousy quest.--Grover's search for Pan isn't mentioned. It's not necessarily important to this film, but it is to the next one because it's why he gets captured.--Hades never shows up as some sort of flame demon at camp in the book.--It's never mentioned that Percy is a child of the Big Three and that's pretty important.--A naiad gives Percy the pearls, they don't go search for them.--Most of the monsters were missing from the film, such as the echidna, the Furies (the bus scene), and they added in the hydra--The prophecy of Percy's sixteenth birthday. It's not mentioned and Percy is all ready sixteen in the movie. They need to do something about the prophecy in the movies since it plays a big role in the books.If they do the second movie, I think they should get a new director because Columbus got this movie completely wrong.",2,Umm....,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,2593,"['Personally', 'thought', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'first', 'two', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'movie', 'was', 'terrible', 'was', 'absolutely', 'NOTHING', 'book.First', 'appearance', 'actors', 'were', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'twelve-year-olds', 'actress', 'playing', 'Annabeth', 'was', 'early', 'twenties', 'when', 'filmed', 'Percy', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'looked', 'character', 'was', 'described', 'book', 'Annabeth', 'had', 'brown', 'hair', 'brown', 'eyes', 'personality', 'was', 'nothing', 'Annabeth', 'book', 'Annabeth', 'could', 'be', 'sometimes', 'sarcastic', 'know-it-all', 'sweet', 'was', 'fierce', 'warrior', 'maiden', 'most', 'movie', 'pretty', 'mean', 'Percy', 'Grover', 'supposed', 'be', 'redhead', 'awkward', 'gangly', 'good', 'friend', 'movie', 'had', 'most', 'attributes', 'gangster', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'really', 'was', 'anything', 'were', 'book', 'was', 'Luke', 'course', 'being', 'good', 'actor', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'long.My', 'main', 'problem', 'though', 'so', 'much', 'changed', 'form', 'book', ""'m"", 'okay', 'few', 'changes', 'books', 'are', 'necessary', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'book', 'only', 'thing', 'had', 'similar', 'was', 'title', 'are', 'continue', 'rest', 'series', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'explaining', 'what', 'everything', 'skipped', 'out', 'lot', 'Spoilers', 'ahead', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'movie', 'ruined', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'Kronos', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'mentioned', 'book', 'think', 'pretty', 'important', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'make', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'main', 'antagonist.', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'really', 'important', 'never', 'mentioned', 'Luke', 'scar', 'sort', 'stemmed', 'turning', 'evil', 'was', 'mad', 'father', 'giving', 'such', 'lousy', 'quest.', 'Grover', 'search', 'Pan', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'not', 'necessarily', 'important', 'film', 'next', 'one', 'why', 'captured.', 'Hades', 'never', 'up', 'sort', 'flame', 'demon', 'camp', 'book.', 'never', 'mentioned', 'Percy', 'child', 'Big', 'Three', 'pretty', 'important.', 'naiad', 'Percy', 'pearls', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'search', 'them.', 'Most', 'monsters', 'were', 'missing', 'film', 'such', 'echidna', 'Furies', 'bus', 'scene', 'added', 'hydra', 'prophecy', 'Percy', 'sixteenth', 'birthday', 'not', 'mentioned', 'Percy', 'ready', 'sixteen', 'movie', 'need', 'do', 'something', 'prophecy', 'movies', 'big', 'role', 'books.If', 'do', 'second', 'movie', 'think', 'should', 'get', 'new', 'director', 'Columbus', 'got', 'movie', 'completely', 'wrong']",N/A
1307512,A85GHQYRQMC4T,B002ZG98J6,"Amazon Customer ""book junkie""","[1, 3]","I really enjoyed this movie, even though there are slight changes to the story compared to the book.  First of all the plot line of the story... Percy is an ADHD and dislexic child attending Yancy Academy.  One day on a field trip, a substitute teacher pulls him aside but turns into a winged creature and attacks him. Mr Brunner, another teacher, and Grover, a friend of Percy's, come to his rescue and subsequently explain that the winged creature was a furie.  Percy is given a ""pen"" that turns into a sword from Mr. Brunner, and sent off to Camp Half-Blood.  On the way to camp, Percy, his mother, and Grover are attacked by a Minotaur.  Percy defeats the beast but not before he believes it has killed his mother.  Percy and Grover arrive in Camp where he meets Chiron, the centaur.  Chiron shows Percy the cabin that ""his father built for him.""  The audience finds out Percy's dad is Poseidon.  The campers then participate in a pretty full contact game of capture the flag, where Percy beats Annabeth.  At the celebration that night Hades appears in the fire to force Percy to give Zeus' lightening bolt to him.  Percy, Grover, and Annabeth then set off on a quest to get Percy's mom back from Hades even though Percy didn't take the lightening bolt that Hades wants.  Luke, another camper, gives them a few items to help along the way, such as a shield and some winged shoes.  In order to exit Hades they must find three of Persephone's pearls that are hidden around the USA.  And off they go!  They rest would just spoil it for you : )I know that it was different in ways from the book but I, overall like the flow of the movie a little better.  I do wish they would have kept all the detail regarding info on the Greek gods and myths in the movie.  I also feel that the movie version of Camp Half-Blood did not live up to the image the book portrays and therefore could have been done better.  I was really looking forward to seeing all the cool cabins, especially Poseidon's, but they were just kind of generic camp tents in the movie.  Also, they took out a lot of what went on at camp before the quest and people Percy meets.  In the movie there is no Dionysus, no oracle, no prophecy, and no Thalia's tree.  Oh, and Clarissa.  If you have never read the book you wouldn't feel like something is missing but it would have been cool to see the oracle and in my opinion the prophecy is important for the sequels.  All this said, after Percy and company leave on their quest, I like the movie better.  I probably can't give you as much detail on this but....I felt the changes they made to the book to make the movie after they left camp made the story flow much more smoothly.  I liked that they left out Ares and Aphrodite, which in my opinion seemed a little disjointed from the rest of the plot of the book.  Instead the blame goes right to Luke, which makes sense.  And when they are traveling the country in search of the pearls....makes way more sense when thinking about why they traveled all over and then Poseidon's messenger just happens to give them the pearls.  Also Percy's defeat of Luke at the end is way more believeable than Percy defeating Ares, god of war!!  Anyhow, I hope you enjoy the book and the movie!  I would recommend both!",4,Good movie even though there were changes made from the book,1277856000,"06 30, 2010",2010,3262,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'even', 'are', 'slight', 'changes', 'story', 'compared', 'book', 'First', 'plot', 'line', 'story', 'Percy', 'ADHD', 'dislexic', 'child', 'attending', 'Yancy', 'Academy', 'One', 'day', 'field', 'trip', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'aside', 'winged', 'creature', 'Mr', 'Brunner', 'teacher', 'Grover', 'friend', 'Percy', 'come', 'rescue', 'subsequently', 'explain', 'winged', 'creature', 'was', 'furie', 'Percy', 'given', 'pen', 'sword', 'Mr.', 'Brunner', 'sent', 'off', 'Camp', 'Half-Blood', 'way', 'camp', 'Percy', 'mother', 'Grover', 'are', 'attacked', 'Minotaur', 'Percy', 'beast', 'not', 'killed', 'mother', 'Percy', 'Grover', 'arrive', 'Camp', 'where', 'Chiron', 'centaur', 'Chiron', 'Percy', 'cabin', 'father', 'built', 'audience', 'out', 'Percy', 'dad', 'Poseidon', 'campers', 'then', 'participate', 'pretty', 'full', 'contact', 'game', 'capture', 'flag', 'where', 'Percy', 'Annabeth', 'celebration', 'night', 'Hades', 'fire', 'force', 'Percy', 'give', 'Zeus', 'lightening', 'bolt', 'Percy', 'Grover', 'Annabeth', 'then', 'set', 'off', 'quest', 'get', 'Percy', 'mom', 'back', 'Hades', 'even', 'Percy', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'lightening', 'bolt', 'Luke', 'camper', 'few', 'items', 'help', 'way', 'such', 'shield', 'winged', 'shoes', 'order', 'exit', 'Hades', 'must', 'find', 'three', 'Persephone', 'pearls', 'are', 'hidden', 'USA', 'go', 'rest', 'would', 'just', 'spoil', 'know', 'was', 'different', 'ways', 'book', 'overall', 'flow', 'movie', 'little', 'better', 'do', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'detail', 'regarding', 'info', 'Greek', 'gods', 'myths', 'movie', 'also', 'feel', 'movie', 'version', 'Camp', 'Half-Blood', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'image', 'book', 'portrays', 'therefore', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'cool', 'cabins', 'especially', 'Poseidon', 'were', 'just', 'kind', 'generic', 'camp', 'tents', 'movie', 'Also', 'took', 'out', 'lot', 'what', 'went', 'camp', 'quest', 'people', 'Percy', 'meets', 'movie', 'Dionysus', 'oracle', 'prophecy', 'Thalia', 'tree', 'Oh', 'Clarissa', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'would', ""n't"", 'feel', 'something', 'missing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'see', 'oracle', 'opinion', 'prophecy', 'important', 'sequels', 'said', 'Percy', 'company', 'leave', 'quest', 'like', 'movie', 'better', 'probably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'detail', '.I', 'felt', 'changes', 'made', 'book', 'make', 'movie', 'left', 'camp', 'made', 'story', 'flow', 'much', 'more', 'smoothly', 'liked', 'left', 'out', 'Ares', 'Aphrodite', 'opinion', 'seemed', 'little', 'disjointed', 'rest', 'plot', 'book', 'Instead', 'blame', 'right', 'Luke', 'sense', 'when', 'are', 'traveling', 'country', 'search', 'pearls', 'way', 'more', 'sense', 'when', 'thinking', 'about', 'why', 'traveled', 'then', 'Poseidon', 'messenger', 'just', 'give', 'pearls', 'Also', 'Percy', 'defeat', 'Luke', 'end', 'way', 'more', 'believeable', 'Percy', 'defeating', 'Ares', 'god', 'war', 'Anyhow', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'book', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend']",N/A

Very little explanation or none is given as to why Percy is considered the thief or how he learns to fight and use his powers so well. These are things that hurt the overall story and give it a 3 star mark. Please, don't get me wrong. This is still a very enjoyable movie, just lower your expectations.BLU RAY THOUGHTS: This is a gorgeous disc. The picture is very strong with a wonderful audio mix.

A lot of the film seems underbudgeted - the acting in scene after scene falls flat, as if the director kept saying, ""Eh. That's good enough. They'll still buy tickets.""The same was true with the special effects and set design: eh, good enough, I guess. While some attention was lavished on Medusa's snake-y tresses, and Hades' demonic fire was cool, many monster sequences had a Harryhausen-esque clumsiness that's surprising to see in this day and age. Finally, the script was atrocious -- dull, flat, overly full of exposition, short on emotional resonance. A lot of this had to do with direction and pacing: Chris Columbus simply doesn't let scenes breathe, he's in too much of a rush to meet his deadlines and get his product out to market. For example, when Percy and his gang realize they've been tricked and that one of them has to stay in the Underworld, hardly anyone bats an eyelash when Percy's sidekick Grover volunteers to become eternally damned. Oh, okay man. Bummer, but I'll come back and get you out. Later, dude, gotta roll. Fight sequences have a similarly lax feel: Minotaur? Dead in sixty seconds. Fire demon? Don't worry; it'll go away soon.  Zeus hassling you?  Tell him to chill, dude.I dunno. I guess this film was ""okay,"" but if you're going to make a fantasy epic, why not make it, you know... epic?

1307545,A24PEJTGCOP13Z,B002ZG98J6,Bookreader,"[168, 217]","First off let me just say that I have read all 5 books at least twice through. I am an avid fan of this series. I was looking forward to this movie for quite a while. Of course this takes the course that many book adaptions take. That is, it differs from the book in many ways. Personally, I went to the midnight showing of this film expecting the differences, and went with an open mind to the idea of differences. And you know what? I immensely enjoyed this film! First, let me run down some differences between the book and film.Unless you've read the book and don't mind finding out what was cut and changed, consider this your SPOILER ALERT!First and most obviously, the ages of the actors. They are all in their late teens, whereas the kids in the book are 12.Second, no Ares, Clarisse, or Dionysus. The fight for the Lightning Bolt is with Luke instead of Ares. And Annabeth takes on the role of the warrior girl in the movie.Third, instead of a quest, Percy Grover and Annabeth just ditch camp to get the lightning bolt and save Percy's mother.Fourth, NO PROPHECY. No mention of Thalia or the Big Three pact. I hope they mention it in The Sea of Monsters if they make it.Those are the 4 biggest changes I remember from the movie and biggest complaints from avid fans. Logan Lerman (Percy), Alexandra Daddario (Annabeth), Brandon T Jackson (Grover), and Jake Abel (Luke) are all great actors. I hadn't really heard of them until The Lightning Thief. But they are terrific actors! Brandon is hilarious as Grover, and makes tons of jokes as the comic relief. Some may find his constant cracking of joke irritating, but in the right mood he's hilarious.Sean Bean, and Kevin Mckidd are great as Zeus and Poseidon respectively. They're not in it very much, but Mr. Mckidd's entrance in the beginning of the film is awesome. I won't reveal more, but he's the first we see in the film.And lets not forget Uma Thurman as Medusa! She was brilliantly done, and was very spooky and awesome. If you've read the book you know she dies, but I wish they would find a way to bring back Medusa because Uma Thurman was brilliant!All in all, this was an amazing film, and I look forward to the deleted scenes included with the Blu-Ray release, because only 5 out of 10 scenes are on the DVD release. Plus, the Blu-Ray comes with a DVD and a code for a free copy on iTunes, which is brilliant. So this is a great film for the whole family, and I know I will be headed to the store to get it after it's release.

Erland,"[0, 0]","'Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief' is the kind of film young boys between the ages of 8 and 12 will go absolutely crazy for. I know I would have if I were still somewhere within those age parameters (some would say I still am but that's another matter). Yes I suppose some girls will enjoy the movie as well however it's generally boys that become absorbed in ancient myths and legends. Just think of it, Olympus and the Gods along with minotaurs, satyrs, centaurs Medusa, furies and many other divine and semi-divine beings exploding to life on the television screen. Great stuff if you're willing to accept good special effects and ignore the rather tepid story-line and particularly horrendous dialogue.Another negative was the rather uninspiring acting abounding in this film. Yes the cast was attractive and did include a number of well known actors and actresses but there rolls where small and little more than cameo appearances. The lead roles were held by the younger members of the cast in the roles of sons and daughters of the Elder Olympian deities.

Luster ""The Rook""","[1, 3]","Although my wife and I enjoyed the movie I may have given it a star less except I'm adding another because of the negative book reviewers writing movie reviews. I appreciate the fact they want the movies to be the books, I really do. This is not going to happen. I must admit it took me awhile to move beyond that same desire which blinded me to the good points. It was made into a movie and some of the material is there to expose the public to an interest which will hopefully get them to read the books.We had no preconceptions going into this movie as neither of us had read this set of books. We will now that we have seen the movie. We find it better that way so we don't cast dispersions because of disappointment. We both found the casting, directing, sets, cinamatography, costumes, F/X, music, sound and the rest quite good. This is basicly a modern version ofClash of the Titans (Keepcase). The story takes place now with a young man in High School living with his mom and stepfather. When Zeus's lightning bolt is stolen he believes Percy, son of Poseidon, stole it.Percy isn't even aware he is a demigod and when he is told it is overwhelming at first as he also has to go on the run to avoid mythical creatures trying to kill him and get the lightning bolt for themselves or their god. Percy (Perseus) goes on an adventure with a satyr and the daughter of Athena. While trying to collect three pearls they encounter the likes of Medussa and a hydra along the way. They try to get Percy's mother out of Hades and return the bolt to Zeus. Overall it smacks of an updated version of the original mythological story of Perseus. If you enjoy mythological movies you will probably enjoy it. Good quality DVD picture and sound with extras listed in the features.

Despite targeting a younger audience, Lightning Thief is actually a fun movie that grown-ups can also enjoy.The Lightning Thief is based on the first novel in a five-book series by Rick Roardan.  Readers may be a bit confused by the film, as Percy is only 12 in the book, but 17 in the movie.  My guess is that Chris Columbus, who also directed Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, made the age change just to appeal to Harry Potter fans now in their late teens.Logan Lerman (3:10 to Yuma) does a good job playing anxious teen Percy Jackson.  Uma Thurman is a terrific addition as Medusa, though she could have gotten more screen time.  While the concept of Greek Mythology in the future sets the film apart from Harry Potter, the chemistry between Percy and his two companions seems a little familiar.  What's great about Lightning Thief are the frequent comic interjections by Brandon T. Jackson (Alpa Chino in Tropic Thunder), playing Percy's wisecracking best friend.Parents, here's the rundown: Teens and tweens will enjoy the movie's visuals, but a few fight scenes (Furies & Hydra) might frighten your little ones.  Rosario Dawson is gorgeous as  Persephone, the seductive wife of Hades; though her suggestive lines will go over most kid's heads.  For adults who aren't into Harry Potter movies, you'll still find the visuals fun, and the movie entertaining.Take my advice about one thing: Don't finish watching the movie when the credits start rolling.  You'll be in for a fun surprise if you hang in there for just a minute ;)",4,Fun Movie With a Surprise During the Credits,1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,1617,"['Here', 'review', 'fans', 'book', 'parents', 'alike', 'should', 'find', 'helpful', 'targeting', 'younger', 'audience', 'Lightning', 'Thief', 'actually', 'fun', 'movie', 'grown-ups', 'can', 'also', 'enjoy.The', 'Lightning', 'Thief', 'based', 'first', 'novel', 'five-book', 'series', 'Rick', 'Roardan', 'Readers', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'confused', 'film', 'Percy', 'only', '12', 'book', '17', 'movie', 'guess', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'Chamber', 'Secrets', 'made', 'age', 'change', 'just', 'appeal', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fans', 'now', 'late', 'teens.Logan', 'Lerman', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'anxious', 'teen', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'terrific', 'addition', 'Medusa', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'concept', 'Greek', 'Mythology', 'future', 'film', 'apart', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'chemistry', 'Percy', 'two', 'companions', 'little', 'familiar', 'What', 'great', 'Lightning', 'Thief', 'are', 'frequent', 'comic', 'interjections', 'Brandon', 'T.', 'Jackson', 'Alpa', 'Chino', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', 'playing', 'Percy', 'wisecracking', 'best', 'friend.Parents', 'here', 'rundown', 'Teens', 'tweens', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'visuals', 'few', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Furies', 'Hydra', 'might', 'frighten', 'little', 'ones', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'gorgeous', 'Persephone', 'seductive', 'wife', 'Hades', 'suggestive', 'lines', 'will', 'go', 'most', 'kid', 'heads', 'adults', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'still', 'find', 'visuals', 'fun', 'movie', 'entertaining.Take', 'advice', 'one', 'thing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'finish', 'watching', 'movie', 'when', 'credits', 'start', 'rolling', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fun', 'surprise', 'hang', 'just', 'minute']",N/A

1307576,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B002ZG98J6,Craig Whittle,"[0, 1]","PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS: THE LIGHTENING THIEFSTARRING: Logan Lerman, Brandon T. Jackson, Pierce Brosnan, Alexandra Daddario, Katherine Keener, Jake Abel, Sean Bean, Uma Thurman, Kevin McKidd, Joe Pantoliano, Steve Coogan and Rosario DawsonWRITTEN BY: Craig Titley; based on the novel by Rick RiordanDIRECTED BY: Chris ColumbusRated: PGGenre: Science Fiction / FantasyRelease Date: 12 February 2010Review Date: 26 March 2010I never went to see Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone at the theater, because I didn't think it would live up to its hype. Having seen it recently for the first time, although it was good, I was right. I had the same thoughts based on the trailer to Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightening Thief. But man, am I glad I didn't listen to them!Although Greek mythology was hands down the most pointless thing we ever studied in high school; it was still one of the most interesting and the film displays it wonderfully. It was a ton of fun and was oozing with the perfect blend of humor and beautifully constructed fantasy / action driven sequences.Logan Lerman practically screams to us, ""Hey, I'm ready to be famous now, because I'm clearly talented!"" and he's right. The kid has got something and we have only seen the beginning of him, trust me. He stars as Percy Jackson; a kid who has a terrific mom played by Katherine Keener, and a dead-beat dad in Poseidon (Kevin McKidd), the god of the sea.Don't worry, the film doesn't ask us to believe that a god who stands several feet taller than any human being, actually impregnated Percy's mother while in his physical god form. Gods are able to shrink down to the size of all of us, as is shown to us in the opening scene, which looked amazing. Poseidon emerges in all of his god-like glory from the ocean, arousing some unwanted suspicion, by some nearby humans.Poseidon transforms himself down to an un-noticeable size and continues on his way as if nothing has happened. He has a very important meeting to attend to, with Zeus (Sean Bean), the god of gods. At this meeting between Zeus and Poseidon, we learn that Zeus's notorious lightening bolt has been stolen, and that Poseidon's' son Percy is believed to be the culprit.Zeus awards Poseidon with a limited amount of time to retrieve it before he will unleash all of his fury. Why the two gods had to have this meeting on earth rather than back at home, where they live together is beyond me. Oh, I guess they wouldn't have been able to open the film with that shot of a giant Poseidon emerging from the ocean... yeah that's probably why. What was I thinking?Not being able to intervene in person, Poseidon sends a comedic sidekick to protect his son. Percy befriends Grover (Brandon T. Jackson), who is half goat / half teenage boy. I suppose if you already have daddy issues brought on by a severe case of abandonment - it will only add fuel to the fire to discover that your father made your best friend be your best friend. Just a thought.Grover and Percy team up together with the help of another teen, who doubles as a secondary sidekick and a potential love interest to Percy. Along their journey to recover the stolen trident, they are met by the following interesting characters: Pierce Brosnan toting a horse's body; Uma Thurman in a dazzling performance as the sinister Medusa; a cunning portrayal of Hades (the god of the underworld) by Steve Coogan; and of course, the most dashing lady in Hollywood ever, Rosario Dawson, as the imprisoned love stricken princess to Hades, Persephone.In addition to these characters played by real life actors, we have daring run-ins with some spectacular computer generated monsters, one of which includes a muliti-headed, fire spewing dragon. Don't take the film's PG rating lightheartedly if you plan on bringing little ones; the special effects are terrifyingly convincing.I'm pleased to see that 2010 is as of yet not the CGI nightmare of a fiasco that 2009 was. With the release of The Wolfman, The Book of Eli and now this, we're off to a pretty good start as far as computer animation is concerned. The effects in this film were the best yet for this year. Look for the water effect that takes place on a rooftop; sensational. And how about Medusa's heedful of sadistic snakes?Attention currently unknown future director of the second Wolverine film; if you are reading this - please hire the special effects crew of this film to do Wolverine's claws for us will you?

Decent special effects, lots of action. . .so what's the problem here?  Goofiness.  Plain, old-fashioned, I-can't-believe-I-just-watched-this goofiness.

After watching this predictable mess I felt embarrassed--for the children who have sat through it.I give the filmmakers some credit for at least exposing young audiences to Greek mythology; but the modern vs. ancient Greek worlds never really mesh, and this incoherence is augmented by, again, the relentless goofiness.  Logan Lerman is an unlikable protagonist as Percy, the loser teen who learns he's actually a demigod; and Brandon T. Jackson is merely annoying playing his sidekick Grover, a satyr who is supposed to protect him.  Everything is contrived, much of the acting feels forced, and the quest to obtain Zeus's lightning bolt to prevent the end of the world is pure nonsensical zaniness.

After doing the 1st two HARRY POTTER films to great success (a few critics roasted him for these), he produced I think a  couple more of them, walked away during the writers' strike as all the Americans did and never returned. While I was not impressed with his original piece A LITTLE PRINCESS, his HARRY POTTER films were responsible for addicting me to HARRY POTTER for life.Now comes the ridiculously titled PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS: THE LIGHTNING THIEF. Not really so hard to type as it is to remember, and a real mouthful, but something one hopes will be reduced to ""the Percy movies"" in the future. Though personally, I hope they have no future.The beautiful Logan Lerman plays Percy the title character, a demigod who is the son of Poseidon. Naturally he does not know this (oh Harry!! Harry Potter!) until the truth is forced upon him (2nd page for Harry Potter!). Percy is the prime suspect in the theft of Zeus' lightining bolt--which looks suspiciously like a light saber--so he must be hidden and trained, because there are hundreds of demigods out there and he needs to be among them (oh, Harry Potter, just forget it).Naturally, the story is predictable to the point of making you feel really psychic and smart for knowing it all from the start. Someone else stole the lightining bolt, and we know who it is the minute he appears onscreen (calling Draco Malfoy). Percy has to fight for his innocence so we see the gods themselves are dumber than dirt, because it is obvious Percy didn't steal anything.Horrendous Greek mythology aside, aren't these the gods?? Don't they know stuff? Apparently not, but there is a cute teenaged boy to teach them all there is to know. This film had some humor, some fun moments and the effects are not bad. With such heavy reliance on picture crispness and CGI, that is some accomplishment. The acting is so-so; Uma Thurman (as Medusa) gives one the creeps if one was raised actually reading this stuff. At least she isn't as terrible as she usually is. And Pierce Brosnan as a centaur made me laugh because...well, I've seen cool centaurs in another film, gee, what film was that anyway?Get it for the kids, and be careful grandma doesn't catch a whiff of this PAGAN film!!

Particularly when you're dealing with the same director who did the first two Potter movies.Unfortunately for most of those elements it's weaker than the movies it gets compared against. Yes it's an American setting and it attempts a slightly edgier tone, but that falls flat given the for kids nature of the movie.The plot itself is blandly inoffensive, the characters and actors are fine.

Johnson ""'ntohign slhe thaersam'""","[0, 1]",">>> This is a review of the BD+DVD+Digital Copy >>>Just so we know up front, I had no knowledge of the books until long after I first saw the movie. And I must say, despite a few off-beats from acting, it can fall into the epic. The plot is hashed down as it has been since times immemorial - middle-class nobody discovers powers beyond their reason. Then he gets a magic sword. Sound like Star Wars, Episode IV? That's where the similarities end. Period.Percy Jackson is a demigod, the only son of Poseidon.  This is the brilliance of the movie before it even gets to the good stuff - we aren't treated to yet another in the long lines of Zeus's bastard sons. Here's a great look at what can happen when folk start to think for themselves. My understanding is that in the books, he is younger enough to make inferences to Harry Potter. And thank the cast and crew for not letting the film fall that way.The MacGuffin is nothing less then the Thunderbolt of Zeus. A short but brilliant scene between Poseidon and Zeus (portrayed by Sean Bean, and with an intensity that makes short work of Liam Neesen's own portrayal of the Greek God Zeus. Sorry, Liam). that show there is no doubt that Sean Bean's Zeus WILL kick your butt backwards if you so much as look at him wrong. The other performances range from awesome (Poseidon - epic Kevin McKidd from Grey's Anatomy, the satyr, Medusa, and best of all Persephone - a delicious and enchanting Rosario Dawson) to slightly forced (Chiron the centaur, Annabelle Chase, Percy's mom). Not that they perform poorly at all; they just fall slightly behind the power-houses previously mentioned (i.e Rosario Dawson).And the highest praise to be Logan Lerman. This is a role that could easily become a poor Harry Potter or Sorcerer's Apprentice, but he steps up to plate for an incredible performance. When he comes into his deific powers, you can see the change in his demeanor, slowly at first. By the end, we believe he can kick butt without Olympian intervention.The special features of this film includes standards like featurettes and deleted scenes. Also included is little interactive ""What Are Your Powers"" quiz, a bit forced itself, but the kiddos' love it.Thankfully, Olympus deems this film worthy of a sequel.

I came to ""Percy Jackson' ""having not read the books and I think my view of the film is better for it. Standing on its own, the film while nothing life changing, is a fun family adventure.Seen by many as grabbing a ride on the coat tails of Harry Potter, the film did not do too well in theatres and to be fair, I think the claim is valid. Percy is a typical teen who doesn't really fit in and hates the odious man his mother has taken up with. But after things go badly wrong on a school trip to a museum Percy is told he is the half human half god son of Poseidon, the ancient Greek god of the seas. He has been accused of stealing the lightning bolt of Zeus and if he doesn't return it the gods will go to war.At first he is hidden in a camp for other half human godlings where they train to be heroes but as word comes Hades has taken Percy's mother to be traded for the lighting bolt, Percy, given guidance by Luke, the son of Hermes, sets out with two friends, Annabeth, daughter of Athena and Grover a satyr looking to earn his horns, to save his mother and find the lightning bolt.The quest is fun and silly, with some danger but nothing too scary for children. A sense of risk does pervade the scenes on the quest so it is appropriately tense. The hazards along the way do take on themes from the Greek myths while the music selection, things like Lady Gaga and AC/DC, keep it modern too.The numerous cameos by big stars as Greek gods is fun and you get the sense they had fun while still playing it up. Most notable is Sean Bean as Zeus, Rosario Dawson as Persephone and Uma Thurmon as some who truly po'ed Annabeth's mother a few years back. Easily stealing any scene he's in is Pierce Brosnan as Percy's teacher.There are a few plot holes in the movie such as; how did anyone steal Zeus' bolt, much less someone, Percy, who doesn't even know of his heritage?  Why do they think it was Percy and with whom are the gods going to war if they are all looking for the bolt? Luckily these are minor issues that don't distract from the film.From what others wrote this is weaker than the book on which it is based but it does stand alone just fine as a family film. Is it up to the par of films about ""the boy who lived?"" To be honest, no, but it is a fun adventure film that does not have gratuitous amounts of gore and foul language.PS Sit through the credits.

Downside - graphics, although good, were largely stolen from 5th grade Greek mythology story books.Negatives:(1.) Whenever a film relies upon darkness to convey darkness I know immediately - cheap film. This one is so dark that when I turn the brightness to the highest level - it's still black. In effect you see nothing! So what's the point of creating a monster if you can't see it?(2.) It takes a creative mind to write/direct creative & plausible fantasy. It takes a ""short-cuts"" mind to write/direct ridiculous fantasy. This movie would have fit perfectly into a Disney, Hannah Montana dream episode.(3.) It takes no mind to utilize the following formulae to sell to the 9-16 year old demographic: Scenes with a dysfunctional family; defiant teen; a black, an attractive female, good looking male (the typical triumvirate with minimal acting skills) and a fourth nerdy-techy providing backup. Lots of close ups of aforementioned male & female teens checking each other out to provide filler and sell the sex-appeal.(4.) Dialogue utilized the minimalist quickie dictionary of the 100 most frequent words in a 9 year old's vocablulary. Further degraded into contrived and artificial cliches such as Percy's first & primary question to Hades on learning his mom might be dead in his domain, ""What have you done with my mother?"" - Ughhh(5.) The camp for demigods looked more like a Boy Scout's summer camp with playground equipment added in. The fight scenes, with obviously plastic swords, looked so staged I was waiting for the director to yell ""action"" or whatever and suddenly every evenly spaced/paired group starts swinging their swords about. And why swords? Hello, 21st century teens that are half gods and do have some god-powers and besides there is technology such as what's found in any gun shop.(6.)

1307636,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B002ZG98J6,Haunted Flower,"[0, 2]","1 Disc Widescreen DVD, being released June 29, 2010""Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief"" besides being a mouthful was directed by Chris Columbus with a screenplay by Craig Titley based on the novel by Rick Riordan. Riordan's books much like the Harry Potter series, have really taken off particularly with the middle school age crowd. His stories follow Percy Jackson named after Perseus who discovers he is a demi-god, son of Poseidon and that there are other demi-gods living among them. Once thrown into this new world, he is wrongfully accused of stealing Zeus' lightning bolt and has to find a way to rectify the situation to save his mother being held hostage.The story itself is charming and empowering much in the same style as Harry Potter. Just like Harry, Percy discovers he has powers, that there is a place he can go to train and learn more about his past and his abilities with other children like him and also like Harry, someone out there resents him and is setting him up to take a fall. For heaven's sake, Harry even has a lightning bolt scar on his face! Despite all these similar factors, the story works and is appealing, particularly to children with dyslexia like Percy has. Of course, his turns out to be a special ability to read ancient Greek so good for him.Percy is played by Logan Lerman whom you might remember from ""3:10 to Yuma"" looks like an up and coming Zac Efron with almost Elijah Wood caliber blue eyes so holds his own pretty good appearance-wise and emotionally as a lead in this series. Catherine Keener lends extra star power by playing his mother, Sally.His sidekick or ""protector"" has he prefers to be called is Grover played by Brandon T. Jackson. Grover is a Satyre whose first priority is to look out for Percy (second priority to find hot chicks). Percy's love interest is Annabeth, daughter of Athena, played by Alexandra Daddario who is very intense with a sword and even more so with her piercing blue eyes.More stars clocking in here are Pierce Brosnan in a too-short stay as a Centaur professor, Uma Therman as a wonderfully hypnotic Medusa, Sean Bean as Zeus, and Rosario Dawson as the very seductive Persephone, wife and hostage of Hades.The story is fun and exciting, not as much as the more popular Harry Potter series, but a good one for kids to jump into since Harry Potter's movie run will be ending soon and this Olympians series is just getting started. Hopefully as the characters age, the intensity will as well following the pattern set before it. I highly recommend checking it out. It's young, cute, adventure-y, and brings in all that fun Greek God mythology. Heck, I liked the Medusa in this film better than the one they came up with for the ""Clash of the Titans"" remake which is saying a lot since they went a different route and made her all modern here. Gotta love exciting times and mutant-like abilities!Bonus Features:In the deleted scenes, Grover takes pictures on his cell phone of one of the naked Greek statues, gives some back story on a failure in his past being a protector, dances and fights more at the Lotus casino, and Hades laments how miserable his life in hell is making a good argument for letting him have the power to overthrow his brothers which is probably why it was cut.There is a Powers Quiz that poses a series of statements asking you to choose how you feel about it with happy/sad/mad/indifferent faces and apparently matches you to the most likely God who would be your parent.""The Book Comes to Life"" is a featurette where the author Rick Riordan talks about having his kids and his students read this book before he sent it off to a publisher and how the grassroots phenonmenon of popularity started for the series. Chris Columbus was attracted to the project because his daughter was listening to the book on tape and she is dyslexic just like the main character so he loved how empowering this was for kids with dyslexia to dream of being a demi-god. Of course there is a trailer in the extras too but that goes without saying.I did not get to review the Blu-Ray edition, but it apparently has twice as many deleted scenes and four more featurettes about Greek Gods and being on the set with Brandon T.

It's not terrible, but so much has been changed, it's virtually unrecognizable. It's one thing to drop secondary characters and scenes that don't affect the outcome of the story; that happens in almost all adaptations. It's quite another to change main characters' personalities (in some cases, drastically), eliminate secondary characters that play a major part in this AND subsequent books, add characters that had no part in the story to begin with, and alter plot, motivation, and oh yeah, THE MAIN VILLAIN. You know you're off to a bad start when the title character's age has been upped almost five years, which flies in the face of the narrative thread that runs through the entire series! (Namely, the Prophecy involving Percy when he reaches 16). One can only deduce that this was made with little regard for fans of the book, which makes little sense, since those are the ones who were looking forward to it the most and most likely to see it in theatres.The actors try, and Logan Lerman is an appealing Percy, but all are let down by a truly lame script that casts them adrift in cliche and tedium.

With this company, everything felt hamstrung from how good it potentially could have been, to the point of being predictable for quite a bit of it. I can see why it was only nominated for a few awards and didn't win any.

1307654,A28HO8AE8GPUIY,B002ZG98J6,J. B. Pritchard,"[98, 131]","Pros:  One or two redeeming acting performances, decent special effects.Cons:  Bad casting, failure to bring the world to life, lack of creativity, complete failure to capture either the tone or the characters from the book.Percy Jackson and his friends are racing to the underworld, desperate to get the lightning bolt in time.  As they reach Hades' residence, they are greeted by Persephone, wearing a ripped black lace, cleavage baring dress.  They ask to see Hades, but Persephone makes a few suggestive remarks and then thrusts her breasts into Grover's face.""I've never had a satyr ...(long pause) ... visit before,"" she purrs in a Spanish accent.Grover (who has already been established as sex obsessed) is appreciative.If this sounds like a scene that would remotely fit in with your concept of the first Percy Jackson book, then you might enjoy this movie.  If not, then stay away, because it's pretty well a snapshot of the movie as a whole.They went for a more mature feel for the movie - not just the characters' ages, but the content reflects this.  The casting for this movie was completely wrong.  It wasn't that the acting was bad, exactly, it was just that some of the actors were completely inappropriate for the parts they were playing.  Grover is not a smooth talking, wise cracking, confident character.  Sure, the guy playing him was funny, but he wasn't Grover.  Annabeth was an even worse failure.  They kept telling us that she was smart, the daughter of Athena, etc., but we don't actually get many instances of her acting smart.  Instead, she seems like a generic tough, sexy action girl.  In fact, every female character in this movie (with the exception of the mothers) is sexualized - Annabeth, the women at the Lotus Casino, the Aphrodite girls, Medusa (who is supposed to be ugly), Persephone.  Female characters that could not be turned into sexy girls (like Clarisse) are cut from the movie altogether.  It isn't that I have a problem with action movies that are about smashing heads and meeting beautiful women, it's just that this is so not what the Percy Jackson series is about.By making this movie about the action, the creators have really undersold the wonder and magic of this series.  I'm not a person who believes that a movie must mimic a book exactly, but there are so many missed opportunities here dealing with setting alone.  For example, in the books each of the Olympian gods has a unique throne - Poseidon's is a fishing chair.  This is something that could have been a great visual for the movie and could have been played up even more - instead the movie opts for identical marble thrones.  In Camp Halfblood, we get generic military setting instead of the unique cabins and campers.  In the Underworld, we get a generic hell instead of great details like the EZ Death line and the burnt out fields of Asphodel.  Generic is the best word to describe this movie.There were a few good points.  The kid who played Percy Jackson really captured that character's impulsiveness and good heart despite being way too old for the role.  The special effects were okay.  Not great, but okay.You might be wondering if this movie would be good to someone who has never read the books.  The answer is no.  It might not be such a huge disappointment, but it is still nothing more than a below average action flick.I tried to decide if the few points of light were enough to give this movie two stars.  I concluded that they weren't, because not only does this movie suck, but it completely ruins any chance for a decent series.  If they make another Percy Jackson movie, then it will have to move away from this one completely to be any good.  1+ stars.",1,Generic,1267660800,"03 4, 2010",2010,3692,"['Pros', 'One', 'two', 'redeeming', 'acting', 'performances', 'decent', 'special', 'effects.Cons', 'Bad', 'casting', 'failure', 'bring', 'world', 'life', 'lack', 'creativity', 'complete', 'failure', 'capture', 'tone', 'characters', 'book.Percy', 'Jackson', 'friends', 'are', 'racing', 'underworld', 'desperate', 'get', 'lightning', 'bolt', 'time', 'reach', 'Hades', 'residence', 'are', 'greeted', 'Persephone', 'wearing', 'ripped', 'black', 'lace', 'cleavage', 'baring', 'dress', 'ask', 'see', 'Hades', 'Persephone', 'few', 'suggestive', 'remarks', 'then', 'breasts', 'Grover', 'face', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'satyr', 'long', 'pause', 'visit', 'Spanish', 'accent.Grover', 'who', 'already', 'been', 'established', 'sex', 'obsessed', 'appreciative.If', 'scene', 'would', 'remotely', 'fit', 'concept', 'first', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'book', 'then', 'might', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'not', 'then', 'stay', 'away', 'pretty', 'well', 'snapshot', 'movie', 'whole.They', 'went', 'more', 'mature', 'feel', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'characters', 'ages', 'content', 'casting', 'movie', 'was', 'completely', 'wrong', 'was', ""n't"", 'acting', 'was', 'bad', 'exactly', 'was', 'just', 'actors', 'were', 'completely', 'inappropriate', 'parts', 'were', 'playing', 'Grover', 'not', 'smooth', 'talking', 'wise', 'cracking', 'confident', 'character', 'Sure', 'guy', 'playing', 'was', 'funny', 'was', ""n't"", 'Grover', 'Annabeth', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'failure', 'kept', 'telling', 'was', 'smart', 'daughter', 'Athena', 'etc.', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'get', 'many', 'instances', 'acting', 'smart', 'Instead', 'generic', 'tough', 'sexy', 'action', 'girl', 'fact', 'female', 'character', 'movie', 'exception', 'mothers', 'sexualized', 'Annabeth', 'women', 'Lotus', 'Casino', 'Aphrodite', 'girls', 'Medusa', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'ugly', 'Persephone', 'Female', 'characters', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'turned', 'sexy', 'girls', 'Clarisse', 'are', 'cut', 'movie', 'altogether', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'smashing', 'heads', 'meeting', 'beautiful', 'women', 'just', 'so', 'not', 'what', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'series', 'about.By', 'making', 'movie', 'action', 'creators', 'have', 'really', 'undersold', 'wonder', 'magic', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'person', 'who', 'movie', 'must', 'mimic', 'book', 'exactly', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'here', 'dealing', 'setting', 'alone', 'example', 'books', 'Olympian', 'gods', 'unique', 'throne', 'Poseidon', 'fishing', 'chair', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'visual', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'instead', 'movie', 'opts', 'identical', 'marble', 'thrones', 'Camp', 'Halfblood', 'get', 'generic', 'military', 'setting', 'instead', 'unique', 'cabins', 'campers', 'Underworld', 'get', 'generic', 'hell', 'instead', 'great', 'details', 'EZ', 'Death', 'line', 'burnt', 'fields', 'Asphodel', 'Generic', 'best', 'word', 'describe', 'movie.There', 'were', 'few', 'good', 'points', 'kid', 'who', 'played', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'really', 'captured', 'character', 'impulsiveness', 'good', 'heart', 'being', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'role', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'okay', 'Not', 'great', 'might', 'be', 'wondering', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'answer', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'such', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'still', 'nothing', 'more', 'below', 'average', 'action', 'flick.I', 'tried', 'decide', 'few', 'points', 'light', 'were', 'enough', 'give', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'concluded', 'were', ""n't"", 'not', 'only', 'movie', 'suck', 'completely', 'chance', 'decent', 'series', 'make', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'movie', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'move', 'away', 'one', 'completely', 'be', 'good', '1+', 'stars']",N/A

I highly recommend them.Now that that is out of the way &#8230; the movies (this one and the second) are just okay. If you don't expect them to resemble the book, your experience of them will be more enjoyable. When he saw both of them, my son commented how they are nothing like the books but that was okay. He had an easier time letting go of that fact than I did. Don't get me wrong, I do like movies that are different than their book counterparts. Both of the Hobbit movies are vastly different than the book, but I enjoyed those movies more than these adaptations. The young actors do their best and the support cast also does a fine job. The first movie, The Lightning Thief, is more enjoyable to me than The Sea of Monsters. I found the first movie introduced the characters and seemed more cohesive. The second movie, The Sea of Monsters, was very choppy. It abbreviated too much of the story. So much so, that you lost the edginess that is so well conveyed throughout the book.If I had to sum my estimation of both of the movies, it would center of that fact for me: the movies lose the tension to experience in the books.

That said here are my impression.No movie could have possibly duplicated the tone of the book. The book is written in first person by protagonist Percy Jackson. Much of the humor and tone of the book comes from Percy's hilarious commentary on his situation and various predicaments. Baring a narration device which is very difficult to pull off without slowing down the pace of the movie to a crawl, any movie made from the book had to take a different approach. The movie has to be judged on its own merits.The movie pretty much succeeds in my opinion. I almost gave it four instead of five stars because I thought the Percy and Annabeth characters were undeveloped. Brandon T. Jackson's Grover stole every scene. The action sequences were well rendered and generally great, in many cases improvements over those in the book.In short, the movie was about as faithful as it was possible to be to the book without being overly long.

He's actually a demigod, the half-blood offspring of the Greek god Poseidon and a human woman. Oh and his best friend isn't really handicapped, but walks with crutches because he's really a half man/half goat satyr who pretends to be handicapped because  he doesn't want to scare everybody with his cloven hooves.Welcome to the wonderful world of Percy Jackson, star of a series of extremely popular books written by Rick Riordan and now his own big budget adventure movie directed by Chris Columbus. Like that other franchise Columbus helped bring to theaters -- you know, the one about a young wizard fighting a guy whose name you aren't supposed to say - Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief is an uneven blend of broad mainstream entertainment and very specific details designed to make the rabid fans of the books happy with the adaptation. As a result, the film gets a little bogged down in details along the way, and way too much of the dialogue plays like a Cliff Notes version of a high school history book, but the special effects are cool and the adventure is fun to watch.The film stars Logan LermThe adults in the movie are a mixed bag, too. Steve Coogan is fantastic as Hades, God of the underworld, and it is fun to watch him go toe-to-toe with his wife Persephone as played by the always entertaining Rosario Dawson. Uma Thurman will simply haunt you as Medusa.That's the good news.On the other end of the spectrum, Sean Bean and Kevin McKidd are little more than cardboard cutouts as Zeus and Poseidon, immortal siblings looking to start a war, and Pierce Brosnan is downright awful as the centaur Chiron. It may be the gear he has to wear to make his horse body special effect work, but Brosnan goes through the movie looking like he's in severe pain whether the scene calls for it or not.an as Percy and the mix of anger and acceptance he brings to the role is really interesting to watch unfold as the story goes along. As his hairy-legged sidekick, Grover the satyr, Brandon T. Jackson is a good match for Percy, combining street sense with the inside knowledge of the gods that will keep his friend alive, delivered in a sly and comical way. Unfortunately, the third member of the heroic trio, Alexandra Daddario isn't given much to do beyond stare at the camera and pose in some overly choreographed fight scenes.[...]",3,A new teen movie franchise is born,1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,2479,"['troubled', 'young', 'teen', 'out', 'mood', 'swings', 'trouble', 'school', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'result', 'dyslexia', 'ADD', 'actually', 'demigod', 'half-blood', 'offspring', 'Greek', 'god', 'Poseidon', 'human', 'woman', 'Oh', 'best', 'friend', ""n't"", 'really', 'handicapped', 'walks', 'crutches', 'really', 'half', 'man/half', 'goat', 'satyr', 'who', 'be', 'handicapped', ""n't"", 'want', 'scare', 'everybody', 'cloven', 'hooves.Welcome', 'wonderful', 'world', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'star', 'series', 'extremely', 'popular', 'books', 'written', 'Rick', 'Riordan', 'now', 'own', 'big', 'budget', 'adventure', 'movie', 'directed', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'other', 'franchise', 'Columbus', 'helped', 'bring', 'theaters', 'know', 'one', 'young', 'wizard', 'fighting', 'guy', 'name', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'say', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'Olympians', 'Lightning', 'Thief', 'uneven', 'blend', 'broad', 'mainstream', 'entertainment', 'very', 'specific', 'details', 'designed', 'make', 'rabid', 'fans', 'books', 'happy', 'adaptation', 'result', 'film', 'little', 'bogged', 'down', 'details', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'version', 'high', 'school', 'history', 'book', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'cool', 'adventure', 'fun', 'watch.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Logan', 'LermThe', 'adults', 'movie', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'too', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'fantastic', 'Hades', 'God', 'underworld', 'fun', 'watch', 'go', 'toe-to-toe', 'wife', 'Persephone', 'played', 'always', 'entertaining', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'will', 'simply', 'haunt', 'Medusa.That', 'good', 'news.On', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'Zeus', 'Poseidon', 'immortal', 'siblings', 'looking', 'start', 'war', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'downright', 'awful', 'centaur', 'Chiron', 'may', 'be', 'gear', 'wear', 'make', 'horse', 'body', 'special', 'effect', 'work', 'Brosnan', 'movie', 'looking', 'severe', 'pain', 'scene', 'Percy', 'mix', 'anger', 'acceptance', 'role', 'really', 'interesting', 'watch', 'unfold', 'story', 'along', 'hairy-legged', 'sidekick', 'Grover', 'satyr', 'Brandon', 'T.', 'Jackson', 'good', 'match', 'Percy', 'combining', 'street', 'sense', 'inside', 'knowledge', 'gods', 'will', 'keep', 'friend', 'alive', 'delivered', 'sly', 'comical', 'way', 'Unfortunately', 'third', 'member', 'heroic', 'trio', 'Alexandra', 'Daddario', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'do', 'stare', 'camera', 'pose', 'overly', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'scenes.', '[', ']']",N/A
1307668,A168VXSISJWQN9,B002ZG98J6,"John D. Muir ""oldies and pies lover""","[0, 0]","This movie has the most mixed set of reviews of any that I can recall seeing. At one end of the spectrum are those who think this is a great movie and are impressed by the fact that it's about Greek mythology. At the other end are those who loved the book and can't get over the differences in the film version. Somewhere in between are the rest of us.Dealing with the five-star reviews first- have you people seriously not seen any movies better than this one? It's an exciting enough adolescent caper, with state-of-the-art special effects (already, of course, outdated). The principal character is likeable, his sidekick is funny and the girl, who remains just a friend, is attractive. The three of them set out on a quest to save the world from evil. Now, let me think, has that idea ever been used before? I'll just repeat the name in case you missed it: Per-cy Jack-son. Does that happen to remind you of Har-ry Pot-ter, by any amazing coincidence? As for Greek mythology- this story tells you nothing about it except the names. The author, instead of calling the three brothers Zeus, Poseidon and Hades, could have called them Larry, Moe and Curly and it wouldn't have made the story one jot less authentic. Indeed, he DOES call Medusa 'Auntie Em'; so much for Greek classicism. Take the movie for what it is, a rather derivative romp with no real substance, and enjoy it- but don't award it five stars.As for the one-star crowd, why is it impossible for you to accept that a movie is not the same vehicle for a story as a book? If the director had tried to create a movie as faithful to the book as you would like (several people mentioned as one of their complaints that the character Annabeth has dark hair instead of blonde- is there no nit too small to pick?) the film would have been so long that everyone would have gone to sleep long before the intrepid trio got anywhere near the underworld. The test is not whether the movie is faithful to the book, but whether it works as a movie. Try to separate the two in your mind and you'll find you enjoy your evening a whole lot more than if you sit there muttering ""That wasn't in the book."" By the way, I read the book before I saw the movie, so don't accuse me of not knowing how wonderful the book is (it isn't, but that's another story).In short, those who opted for a star choice somewhere in the middle have got it right. The average review rating is three stars and that's exactly what this movie deserves. It's an enjoyable, light-hearted couple of hours, with a good director and a decent cast. It's not a classic and it's not a dud. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must get to Auntie Em's before they close. I need a few more statues for the garden.",3,Hit or myth?,1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,2715,"['movie', 'most', 'mixed', 'set', 'reviews', 'can', 'recall', 'seeing', 'one', 'end', 'spectrum', 'are', 'who', 'think', 'great', 'movie', 'are', 'impressed', 'fact', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'other', 'end', 'are', 'who', 'loved', 'book', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'differences', 'film', 'version', 'Somewhere', 'are', 'rest', 'us.Dealing', 'five-star', 'reviews', 'first-', 'have', 'people', 'seriously', 'not', 'seen', 'movies', 'better', 'one', 'exciting', 'enough', 'adolescent', 'caper', 'state-of-the-art', 'special', 'effects', 'already', 'course', 'outdated', 'principal', 'character', 'likeable', 'sidekick', 'funny', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'friend', 'attractive', 'three', 'set', 'out', 'quest', 'save', 'world', 'evil', 'Now', 'let', 'think', 'idea', 'ever', 'been', 'used', ""'ll"", 'just', 'repeat', 'name', 'case', 'missed', 'Per-cy', 'Jack-son', 'happen', 'remind', 'Har-ry', 'Pot-ter', 'amazing', 'coincidence', 'Greek', 'mythology-', 'story', 'nothing', 'names', 'author', 'instead', 'calling', 'three', 'brothers', 'Zeus', 'Poseidon', 'Hades', 'could', 'have', 'called', 'Larry', 'Moe', 'Curly', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'story', 'one', 'jot', 'less', 'authentic', 'Indeed', 'call', 'Medusa', ""'Auntie"", 'Em', 'so', 'much', 'Greek', 'classicism', 'Take', 'movie', 'what', 'rather', 'derivative', 'romp', 'real', 'substance', 'enjoy', 'it-', 'do', ""n't"", 'award', 'five', 'stars.As', 'one-star', 'crowd', 'why', 'impossible', 'accept', 'movie', 'not', 'same', 'vehicle', 'story', 'book', 'director', 'had', 'tried', 'create', 'movie', 'faithful', 'book', 'would', 'like', 'several', 'people', 'mentioned', 'one', 'complaints', 'character', 'Annabeth', 'dark', 'hair', 'instead', 'blonde-', 'nit', 'too', 'small', 'pick', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'everyone', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'sleep', 'long', 'intrepid', 'trio', 'got', 'anywhere', 'underworld', 'test', 'not', 'movie', 'faithful', 'book', 'movie', 'Try', 'separate', 'two', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'find', 'enjoy', 'evening', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'sit', 'muttering', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'way', 'read', 'book', 'saw', 'movie', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'accuse', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'wonderful', 'book', ""n't"", 'story', 'short', 'who', 'opted', 'star', 'choice', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'have', 'got', 'right', 'average', 'review', 'rating', 'three', 'stars', 'exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'light-hearted', 'couple', 'hours', 'good', 'director', 'decent', 'cast', 'not', 'classic', 'not', 'dud', 'Now', ""'ll"", 'excuse', 'must', 'get', 'Auntie', 'Em', 'close', 'need', 'few', 'more', 'statues', 'garden']",N/A

We were planning on taking my class to see this piece of junk, not having any idea that something this wretched could come out of such wonderful books. Luckily, my girlfriend and I saw it on opening night - we were very excited about the release. WOW! Throughout this endless pile of dreck that was supposed to have something to do with Percy Jackson, we kept looking at each other in bewilderment. Was it the jive-talking black stereotype that was offensively portraying Grover, the lack of story or characters, Chris Columbus' typically horrid directing (PLEASE do not let this talentless hack direct The Man of Steel!)? All of the above and more, I'm afraid. One of my students who saw it ( we read the book as a class) said it was like some moron just tore out the action scenes from the book, filmed them badly and tossed them onto a movie screen without ever having read the story. This is an unmitigated disaster, especially since it had the potential to become a series of films. You can forget that now! Realizing how horrible this turkey was, the studio started covering it up like it was in a kitty litter box, which is where it deserves to be.

I think the second disclosure I should make, for the record, is to seeing this movie on the plane.  Granted I was lucky enough to see it in first class, but still, the screen is tiny and the sound just doesn't bode well for a good movie experience.  I am sure these factors degraded my appreciation, but I have to admit there just wasn't much there to pull me in.  It seemed cumbersome, choppy, forced.  Almost as if it were tripping over itself as the movie progressed.The movie begins with Percy living the life of an ordinary high school student.  He has no idea he is a demigod and the son of Poseidon.  During a trip to the museum he gets attacked by a creature from beyond and finds out the world as he knows it is not quite as it was.  His mother along with his protector (Brandon T. Jackson) attempt to take him to the safety of the school for the God's offspring.  Mom then quickly gets abducted and shipped off to the God Hades.  Seems that before Percy even has a chance to digest his newfound status he immediately sets off on a quest.His goal is to grab a few keys for the return trip home, but these are guarded by a few ugly looking creatures.  Medusa is played by Uma Thurman and all I can say is in context of the movie, oh how the mighty have fallen.  Uma attempted to reincarnate her ""Kill Bill"" persona, with a hair full of snakes, but sadly there was just something missing.  That seemed to ring true with most of the story.  Luckily Uma only graced the screen for a few minutes which led us to the overriding plot.  Poor Percy was accused of stealing Zeus' lightning, and at some point he really needed to clear his name to avoid an all out war of the Gods.In the end of course Percy saves the day and hands over the lightning, back to Zeus the rightful owner.  He rescues his mom and luckily she finally evicts the foul smelling step father.  Apparently he was only around to mask Percy's aura anyway.  Damn, now what a mom will put up with for the sake of her god like son.  We never did get to see if Percy hooked up with Alexandra Daddario, but she was one of the truly refreshing aspects of the movie.  She played a hard core fighter with just enough of the soft side to keep all the young boys on their toes.Keeping in mind this was a movie geared toward the younger generation, it was ok.  It seemed like it could have been so much better but just never quite figured out whether it was an adventure film or a comedic spoof.  The lame jokes were buttered a little too heavily for me to tolerate in an all out epic quest flick.

My 12  year old has read them all and loved them, but I did not read any of them before seeing PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS: THE LIGHTNING THIEF tonight.  And while I see many, many similarities to the Harry Potter series, I really enjoyed THE LIGHTNING THIEF.  Although it feels a bit familiar, it is still a fun and exciting adventure.  And a very delightful family film.Percy Jackson is a misfit, always in trouble and having difficulty in school.  He has a lot of trouble reading; the letters dance around the page.  The one place he feels at home is in the water.  Turns out, there is a good reason for that.  It seems that Percy is the son of the god Poseidon and a human mother.  And there are others like him, ""half-blood"" kids (demi-gods) who all attend a special camp to learn to use their powers and to protect themselves.  But now, the Earth is in danger.  Someone has stolen Zeus's lightning bolt.  If it is not returned by the solstice, then the gods will go to war.  And humanity will suffer the consequences.  Did Percy steal Zeus's bolt?  If not, then who did?  Can Percy and his companions Annabeth and Grover find the lightning bolt and return it to Olympus before the deadline?As you can see from the above synopsis, there are huge parallels between Percy Jackson and Harry Potter - secret powers, a trio of friends, a special school, a dangerous quest, and the world in peril.  Add to that director Chris Columbus, who also happened to direct the first two Potter films, and you get a movie with a very similar look and feel.  But in this case, the copy holds up well to the original.  THE LIGHTNING THIEF is a an enjoyable romp through Greek mythology with really great special effects, an engaging story, good acting, and an amusing touch of humor.  All-in-all, it made for a terrific evening out with my family.

There's suspension of belief for a film's sake. And then there's just plain ol' mind boggling moronic.Guess which of two options this production falls into?Tells the tale of Percy Jackson, the hidden son of the Poseidon - Greek God and Lord Of The Seas. Growing up in New York with adoptive parents, he has no idea of his true heritage, although there are hints that something is different about him. Now, having reached young adulthood, Percy is finally told who his real parents are and is given a chance to join his fellow demigods in a special school where he can train to become a great warrior.Got that? The Greek Gods - Zeus, Apollo, Athena, etc., and Greek mythological creatures like Medusa and Pan - and they're all living in the United States. Not Greece, or even Europe, they've moved to the East Coast.Why? Who knows. &lt;smdh>I will say that I suspect this film does not play well in Greece.And before any fanboy or fangirl jumps in to say, ""This, this is the reason!"" (emphasis on the exclamation point)Here's my point - and one that I seem to be repeating more and more nowadays:IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE FILMMAKERS TO DELIVER A STANDALONE PRODUCT. IT IS NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AUDIENCE TO DO FURTHER RESEARCH IN ORDER TO MAKE SENSE OF THE MOVIE.I could do a point-by-point deconstruction, but what would that accomplish? It's like discussing the Middle East Peace Process with the self-same ten year old, whose glassy eyed stare of boredom would be your only reward.Additionally, it's usually a bad sign for any film if the best elements anyone can talk about are the special effects - which by the way are decent-to-pretty good.If you have young children - this is a 'must see'. If you're a teenager this is a 'might rent'. And if you're an adult this is a 'must pass'.Personal Notes:- I'm actually a fan of YA movies. Done right, they can be very enjoyable. The 'Hunger Games' franchise and newly minted 'Divergent' films are proof that these productions can be appreciated by a wide audience.- Feel bad for Pierce Brosnan. I know he quietly campaigned to be in the Harry Potter franchise, and this movie must've seemed like his chance.

Now, I realize that there do have to be changes between a book and its movie.  That's fine, but the changes to this completely changed the story, making any sequels virtually impossible.  The biggest problem I could see was changing the bad guy.  What is with Hollywood making Hades out to be the bad guy?  First, it was done by Disney's Hercules many years ago.  Now, it's this one, and they even did the same thing in the remake of Clash of the Titans.  What are they going to do with the final battle at the end of the series?  Will it be Hades, along with the Furies, against Olympus?  That wouldn't stand a chance.  Also, they messed up everything from the very beginning of the movie.  Having Zeus and Poseidon meet on the roof, and say they hadn't seen each other for a few years?  In Mythology, they met multiple times a year for the equinoxes and solstices, unless they were being petty about something, of course.So, they combined Annabeth and Clarice, Hades and Cronus, and I thought there was another, but I've tried to blank as much of this horrid film from my mind as possible.  If the director/screenplay author had at least looked at the mythology that these books were based on, it might have been better, even with combining some characters, but the main enemy still should not have been changed.I've seen some people compare this to the Harry Potter books, and that's fine.

1307711,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG98J6,Mark Turner,"[1, 3]","New on DVD this week is PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS: THE LIGHTNING THIEF. Long title but what would you expect since the books it's based on has the same? Having never read the book written for the teen crowd and having no expectations for the movie, I went it not knowing for sure what to expect. For me that turned out great as I came across a highly enjoyable movie.The movie opens with a meeting between Zeus (Sean Bean) and Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) atop the Empire State building. It seems someone has stolen Zeus' lightning bolt and he believes it was Poseidon's son. He now gives Poseidon 10 days for the bolt to be returned or war will break out between the gods.Off we move to Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman). Percy is your typical high school nobody. With best friend Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) he wanders aimlessly through school dealing with bullies and dyslexia. But on a trip to a local museum's display of Greek mythology the Greek words read clearly to Percy. When a substitute teacher takes Percy off for a discussion, she turns into a scaly winged Fury and attacks him, asking where the bolt is. To his rescue come Grover and teacher Mr. Brunner (Pierce Brosnan). Once the Fury is gone, they tell Percy he needs to learn the truth and head to a place of safety.With his mother and Grover along, Percy discovers who he truly is. It seems that Percy's father was Poseidon, making Percy a demi-god or half human/half god. The place of safety is a camp for those like him in training but before he gets into the camp, his mother is captured by Hades and taken to the depths of hell.Once inside the camp Grover reveals his true form, a satyr or half man half goat. Mr. Brunner also reveals himself as Chiron, a centaur who trains those in the camp. Discussing the problems at hand, Chiron begins training Percy. During the training, Percy takes an interest in Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), the daughter of Athene and makes friends with Luke (Jake Abel) the son of Hermes.Tested in battle, Percy learns of powers he has that derive from water. Knowing that he must go to Olympus to tell Zeus of his innocence, he first decides to rescue his mother from Hades. Joining him in his quest are both Grover and Annabeth. To find the gate to hell, they ask Luke whose father was the only person to ever enter and escape unharmed. Luke provides them with a few items including a map that will reveal the entrance. All they need is to retrieve 3 pearls that will not only provide them the means of escape but illuminate the hidden locations on a map he provides.The majority of the movie involves the journey these three take across the U.S. to find the clues to the gate as well as retrieve the pearls. These journeys bring them into contact with everything from a fire breathing Hydra to Medusa (Uma Thurman). Each of them develops not only individuals learning about themselves as they move forward, but as characters in the story as well.Of course the journey doesn't always take them where they want nor are the results of the journey as they expect. But they do move forward, become heroes in their own right and finally have their confrontation with both the real lightning thief as well as the court of gods on Mount Olympus.The most obvious attraction to this movie is the special effects and those in charge here have done a tremendous job. But one would expect no less from director Chris Columbus who brought us HOME ALONE and two of the Harry Potter films. Under his direction the film flows smoothly and you never once feel the need to check the clock to see how much more there is. You're left, instead, wanting more.The young casts does a great job in each of their roles and the old pros do a fine job as well never hogging the stage from these upstarts. It would have been easy to do too, but instead they remain pros and allow the story to take center stage as well as these youngsters.When released in theaters this film didn't do nearly as expected which is sad. One can only hope that they continue to film the other books in the series. Not only did it provide a nice family film that could be enjoyed, it also might serve to interests young people into looking deeper into the myths of ancient Greece which would possibly lead to more interest in learning. One can only hope.While critics have felt the need to slam this film and call out what they think are shortcomings, I'd advise to give this one a look.

1307730,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B002ZG98J6,mitchell5954,"[1, 1]","Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief is mediocre at best as both a film in general and also a fantasy film.  I have seen many fantasy movies at this point like The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Narnia films, the Harry Potter films, etc.  Compared to all of those films this does not stack up well.  It is definitely not the worst fantasy movie out there.  It is not as bad as the Twilight Saga or the Golden Compass, but it is not anything special either.First of all I did not find the characters interesting at all.  They are the stereotypical characters that you tend to find in a story like this.  Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) himself is the typical hero and fish-out-of-water characters.  There is nothing to his character that I have not seen before and done better.  Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) is the typical black comic relief who I did not think was that funny.  The best character in the movie is definitely Annabeth (Alexandra Deddario).  She is the love interest I guess, but she is tough and can take care of herself.  She is the best of the main cast, but even her I did not find all that interesting either.  There are other decent character like Zeus (Sean Bean) Mr. Brunner (Pierce Brosnan), but they are not in the film that much.The story is very simple and not interesting.  Someone stole Zeus's lightning bolt and they half to go find it.  Sometimes simple stories can work if the movie is entertaining, but in this case it wasn't.Another thing that did not work for me was that they take a lot of Greek Mythology and modernize it for comedy which does not work at all, at least for me.  The comedy is not funny at all either.  There were a couple scenes that got a laugh but mostly the humor was dry.  The effects were not that good either.

It wasn't horrible, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed. Here is a list of some of the things I didn't care for:- Percy was older than he was in the book, so where does that leave him to go as the series continues?- Barely any mention of Kronos, who is the actual antagonist of the series- The whole St. Louis scene was left out, moved to Nashville.  Having Percy control the Mississippi River rather than water out of drinking fountains would have been so much better.- Medusa was so UGLY she turned people to stone when they looked at her.  In the movie she was awfully pretty with the exception of her hair.- The movie lacked the banter, insults and sarcasm that made the book so much fun. The movie was almost too serious.- Aries, Aphrodite and Hermes were left out altogether.  \- Percy's sword was just a sword where as in the book it was almost a living entity with a name.  It was explained that no matter what happened to it, the sword would reappear in his pocket when he needed it.- There was no connection between Annabeth and Luke as there was in the book.  This connection also plays an important part in the rest of the series.But I said the movie wasn't horrible and here is what I liked:- The guy playing Percy, although too old, did a good job.- Grover was great.- Most of the mythical creatures were very well done and the explanations for them were also good.- Most of the fight scenes were very exciting- The gods were portrayed well and of course they have the obligatory British accents.My son, who has not read the books, enjoyed it and had no trouble following the story line.

You either couldn't hear a word anyone was saying or you had to rush to turn it down before you lost your ear drums. There was no in-between. As for the effects, I spent half the movie looking away from the annoying strobe effects that gave me a headache. If I could have heard what people were saying without having my hearing destroyed a moment later or actually managed to look at all those special effects they spent their film budget on, I might have enjoyed it.

Why does Hollywood constantly feel the need to take an existing property that's loved by millions and turn it into something that bears almost zero resemblance to the source material?  I just don't get it.  Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The lightening thief is yet another sad example of this far too often occurring phenomenon.Don't get me wrong, I am not a super fan of the book.  I thought the book was entertaining, but pretty mediocre.  That being said though-I still expected a decent movie.  My first reaction after seeing it though was...""huh?""  and ""Did I miss something?""  First off, it was completely wrong in tone.  Granted, the book is very contemporary as are the characters, but at its heart it's still a fantasy.  The movie by comparison tried to be some uber-cool teeney bopper road trip flick that just didn't fit the context of the story.  Second, there are missing characters (Ares anyone?), tons of missing scenes and even a major plot point that's completely absent.  Also-the kids seem way too old.  And what was up with Grover?  The Grover from the book is completely gone-replaced by a completely different character that totally misses the point of who Grover really is.Even if you ignore the book, I still don't think this is a very good movie.  Besides a couple of really cool scenes and really cool creatures-this movie came off as kind of obnoxious.  Good casting on the adults though (Ares, Poseidon, Athena, Chiron) as well as Percy & Luke, but I can't say much for the rest of the cast.  The actor who played Grover was pretty good, but like I mentioned-completely wrong for the character.  Just like Eragon & The Golden Compass  I doubt there will be anymore books in this series developed into films.  And rightfully so.

1307764,AZL8ZFJMYLSV3,B002ZG98J6,P. Walker,"[2, 8]","Created for a younger audience you can understand the sophomoric atmosphere that permeates this film. But the film also has a ""dumbed down"" feel that actually becomes irritating. Some have compared this, and even suggested that it competes, with Harry Potter films, I disagree. Harry Potter is: Respectful - even to his enemies. Academic - having a hunger to learn. Humble - confiding with and yielding to his elders and even his peers. Cooperative - working with others to achieve what's best for everyone. Considerate - considers the thoughts and feelings of those around him, even when they are wrong or confused. Although Harry faces tremendous obstacles, including dealing with the loss of his parents, he always displays an air of integrity and honesty that gains him the respect of his elders, peers, and even his enemies.Percy Jackson is: Disrespectful - to his father and teachers, it's all about Percy, after all he's a child of a god. Inconsiderate - doesn't even consider that his father CANNOT associate with him. Anti-academic - doesn't listen to learned or intelligent people, is torpid in class listening to his music player with a vacuous stare in his eyes (blames dyslexia & ADHD - more pills please). Thief - steals the gold coins from the fountain before knowing they could have belonged to Medusa or not, although that's not a justification. Uses people - Percy and his mother use her ""boyfriend"" (his stink) to hide Percy from the gods (what did Percy do when he was away from him). Vengeful and possibly murderous - in an epilogue scene, between the credits, the mother's ""boyfriend"" is murdered using the Medusa, knowing full well of his obtrusive nature that he would spring the trap they set for him. These flaws are not only supported and approved of, they are praised (the centaur, played by Pierce Brosnan, shows approval and admiration for Percy's disobedience). Also the basic premise of the film depends on him not obeying and suggests that the only reason to have authority and rules are to disregard them. Although Percy faces tremendous obstacles, he does so in a bumbling, foolhardy, ignorance is bliss kind of way that risks the lives of himself and those around him. Evidently because someone in the heavens is watching over him.Although gods are ultimately created as a means of control, the Greek gods were also born from a desire to understand and explain nature and man's place in the universe. The gods of today are created to control and dominate nature and man. That is why both suffer so much in our time. The ancient people had already faced the contradictions of most of their beliefs and tried to deal with them. Notice in this film that the gods are very emotional and have many human characteristics like anger, sadness, and petty rivalry. However they are not omniscient, they do not know everything. Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, as well as the other gods have no clue as to where Zeus's Bolt is located.An omniscient god cannot have emotions. For example, if you came home to find that your spouse has been having an affair. You would become angry or sad because it is new information, something you've now learned. If you had all knowledge there would be nothing for you to learn, you would have known it for as long as you existed. An emotional omniscient god nullifies itself. So an omniscient god repentant of previous actions that eventually destroys everything in a flood because of anger is illogical. Another example is an infinite, perfect, loving god who has no need of anything and therefore could not experience loneliness or lack creating a people knowing that ninety percent will suffer an excruciating torture for an eternity. If you were all-knowing and knew you were going to have ten children but eight or nine of those children would suffer not only in this world but for an eternity in a hell, I doubt you would ever have children. I wouldn't do it if only one of my ten children were to suffer. To experience loneliness and satisfy it knowing that it would cause unimaginable suffering would be the ultimate in selfishness. To be all-loving and do it would be the ultimate in cruelty.For ages gods have been a perfect way to control people. Simply create a god, then define what [you] the god likes and dislikes and which people to hate or love. Then exploit peoples fears and prejudices, using laws or violence if necessary. And presto! You have control. This is why gods tend to look like or have the characteristics of the people, culture or environment, of those who worship them. Contrary to some popular belief god is actually made in our image.If all the world decided that we would not acknowledge any god, we would not go to a church, temple, synagogue, etc., there would be little change. If we decided to do the same with money, that we would not buy or sell, the world system would come to a halt. The true god of this world is money. There's a correlation between the fact that the majority of people that believe in a god have less money, are more illiterate, and are therefore more controllable. A very small percentage of people control the wealth of the world and a large portion believe in a god. If I were to ask you to find the closest source of the words ""In God We Trust"" where would you suggest? Religion doesn't teach you HOW to think, it teaches you WHAT to think.",1,"I can do anything I want, I'm a child of a god!",1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,5357,"['Created', 'younger', 'audience',

1307772,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B002ZG98J6,RJ Smoove,"[1, 1]","What a surprise. Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief was not as bad as I thought it would be. Of course the big comparison has been made a thousand times, and while it's certainly no Harry Potter, I don't think it doesn't matters in the slightest. The first two harry Potter films happen to share the same director, Chris Columbus. I have to admit that this movie was surprisingly entertaining. The effects were top notch, and the actors weren't so bad either. Sure, there were a few spots where dialogue was a little shoddy, which would make any actor look bad delivering it, but overall, I thought they were good. As Brandon T. Jackson's performance was probably my favorite, because he was so tongue-in-cheek that it's impossible to take his character seriously. That sounds bad, but I mean it in a good way. It's nice to see him in another worthwhile role (in my opinion anyway), after his last substantial role being in one of my all-time favorite comedies, Tropic Thunder. He made me laugh a couple times, like near the beginning when Percy (played by Logan Lerman) frantically asked him if he was half donkey, then he replied, ""I'm half goat."" It's hard to explain, but his expression just worked perfectly for me. Speaking of our lead, Logan Lerman, he was actually pretty good as well. He's probably best known for his role in 3:10 To Yuma, and that's still his best. Not to take anything away from his performance here.I hate to say this, but I'm surprised to see Uma Thurman as Medusa in this movie. Not because I think that she's too good for the part, but because her screentime was very short. It was just long enough to not be a cameo, but too short to say she's a star. Even so, she played a pretty essential part throughout the rest of the story, including a mid-credits stinger. I was also surprised to see Pierce Brosnan, Rosario Dawson and Steve Coogan, all of which are actors that I enjoy watching. They all seemed to have fun with their roles, and in a film like this, that helps a lot. If the actors take their roles too seriously, it'll come off as hokey, or corny. When you can tell that the cast obviously had fun making the film, then it allows you to lighten up and have fun watching them ""work"". Not sure if the following is really a spoiler, but in case it is, you've been warned. Pierce Brosnan plays a minotaur who is seemingly the only instructor in a camp for the young demigods. I thought that was kind of odd, considering there was a lot of students in that camp, but it wasn't too distracting. Steve Coogan played Hades, and he played him with a rockeresque persona. In his actual ""Hades form"", he's quite menacing, but as himself, not so much. I should say though, it did fit, oddly enough. Rosario Dawson played Persephone, the daughter of Zeus (Sean Bean), who was abducted by Hades, and is now the queen of the Underworld. I rather enjoyed their love-hate relationship (mostly hate).Overall, I thought the action was well choreographed, and accompanied by some gorgeous CGI, and some questionable CGI. Of course it's not perfect, or completely convincing, but it's still looks pretty good nonetheless. But in all honesty, how likely is it that even the best looking centaur or dragon would convince the audience? We know these are mythical creatures, so their believability is shot from the start. As for the action itself, the best in the film came when the three main characters, Percy, Grover and Annabeth, were fighting hand-to-hand. Yeah, the budget-focused CGI battles were good, but I'm a stickler for hand-to-hand combat. I thought it was a little brutal for a PG film, and I liked that. The transfer was truly amazing as well. I honestly cannot complain too much about it. There were a number of nighttime scenes, and usually those scenes lose detail and become a bit murky, but that wasn't the case here. I was always able to clearly decipher everything in dark shots. The audio was damn good too. It's still pretty much reference quality. I would definitely recommend this movie to kids (all ages) who aren't too ""cool"", in the South Park and FPS age, to enjoy cheesy fantasy films. For older adults, maybe not so much. I am actually looking to a sequel. There are lots movies that don't deserve them, but sequels get made anyway. Percy Jackson and the Olympians is one that does deserve it.6.5/10",3,"Not For Everyone, but Worth a Look",1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,4367,"['What', 'surprise', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'Olympians', 'Lightning', 'Thief', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'course', 'big', 'comparison', 'been', 'made', 'thousand', 'times', 'certainly', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""n't"", 'matters', 'slightest', 'first', 'two', 'harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'happen', 'share', 'same', 'director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'have', 'admit', 'movie', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'effects', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'Sure', 'were', 'few', 'spots', 'where', 'dialogue', 'was', 'little', 'shoddy', 'would', 'make', 'actor', 'look', 'bad', 'delivering', 'overall', 'thought', 'were', 'good', 'Brandon', 'T.', 'Jackson', 'performance', 'was', 'probably', 'favorite', 'was', 'so', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'impossible', 'take', 'character', 'seriously', 'bad', 'mean', 'good', 'way', 'nice', 'see', 'worthwhile', 'role', 'opinion', 'anyway', 'last', 'substantial', 'role', 'being', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'comedies', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', 'made', 'couple', 'times', 'beginning', 'when', 'Percy', 'played', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'frantically', 'asked', 'was', 'half', 'donkey', 'then', 'replied', ""'m"", 'half', 'goat', 'hard', 'explain', 'expression', 'just', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'Speaking', 'lead', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'role', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'still', 'best', 'Not', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'performance', 'here.I', 'hate', 'say', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'see', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Medusa', 'movie', 'Not', 'think', 'too', 'good', 'part', 'screentime', 'was', 'very', 'short', 'was', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'not', 'be', 'cameo', 'too', 'short', 'say', 'star', 'Even', 'so', 'played', 'pretty', 'essential', 'part', 'rest', 'story', 'including', 'mid-credits', 'stinger', 'was', 'also', 'surprised', 'see', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'are', 'actors', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'seemed', 'have', 'fun', 'roles', 'film', 'lot', 'actors', 'take', 'roles', 'too', 'seriously', ""'ll"", 'come', 'off', 'hokey', 'corny', 'When', 'can', 'tell', 'cast', 'obviously', 'had', 'fun', 'making', 'film', 'then', 'lighten', 'up', 'have', 'fun', 'watching', 'work', 'Not', 'sure', 'following', 'really', 'spoiler', 'case', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'minotaur', 'who', 'seemingly', 'only', 'instructor', 'camp', 'young', 'demigods', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'odd', 'considering', 'was', 'lot', 'students', 'camp', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'distracting', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'played', 'Hades', 'played', 'rockeresque', 'persona', 'actual', 'Hades', 'form', 'quite', 'menacing', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'should', 'say', 'did', 'fit', 'oddly', 'enough', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'played', 'Persephone', 'daughter', 'Zeus', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'who', 'was', 'abducted', 'Hades', 'now', 'queen', 'Underworld', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'mostly', 'hate', '.Overall', 'thought', 'action', 'was', 'well', 'choreographed', 'accompanied', 'gorgeous', 'CGI', 'questionable', 'CGI', 'course', 'not', 'perfect', 'completely', 'convincing', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'nonetheless', 'honesty', 'how', 'likely', 'even', 'best', 'looking', 'centaur', 'dragon', 'would', 'convince', 'audience', 'know', 'are', 'mythical', 'creatures', 'believability', 'shot', 'start', 'action', 'best', 'film', 'came', 'when', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Percy', 'Grover', 'Annabeth', 'were', 'fighting', 'hand-to-hand', 'Yeah', 'budget-focused', 'CGI', 'battles', 'were', 'good', ""'m"", 'stickler', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'brutal', 'PG', 'film', 'liked', 'transfer', 'was', 'truly', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'honestly', 'can', 'not', 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'were', 'number', 'nighttime', 'scenes', 'usually', 'scenes', 'lose', 'detail', 'become', 'bit', 'murky', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'here', 'was', 'always', 'able', 'clearly', 'decipher', 'everything', 'dark', 'shots', 'audio', 'was', 'damn', 'good', 'too', 'still', 'pretty', 'much', 'reference', 'quality', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'kids', 'ages', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'cool', 'South', 'Park', 'FPS', 'age', 'enjoy', 'cheesy', 'fantasy', 'films', 'older', 'adults', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'am', 'actually', 'looking', 'sequel', 'are', 'lots', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'sequels', 'get', 'made', 'anyway', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'Olympians', 'one', 'deserve', 'it.6.5/10']",N/A

of how much I miss the magic of Ray Harryhausens work.Ray's movies included many of the monsters/characters seen here like the Medusa,The Hydra,Poseidan and many others.However here in 2010 its all CGI and I must say I was impressed with the work done.However the weak plot is what brings this film down and no matter the amount of S/FX,they can't make it rise above itself.The plot finds The Greek God Zeus meeting with the God Poseidan atop the Empire State Building.Old Zeus is in an uproar because his infamous lightning bolt has gone missing and he is accusing Poseidans son Percy Jackson of stealing it.Zeus gives Poseidan a short time to retrieve it or there will be war.Percy is just your average high school student,kind of shy and withdrawn.His main friend is on crutches and he has no idea who or what he really is.On a class excursion to a museum his teacher gets him alone,turns into a harpe like creature and wants the lightning.He is scared stiff and has no idea what it wants or why and it flees after his friend reveals himself to be his protector.He runs home to Mom and together all three head for a camp for half bloods(half humans ,half Gods that no mortals can enter).On the way his mother is seemingly killed by a rather large Centaur,who in turn is killed by Percy.In the camp the truth comes out and Percy now knows that he is the half son of the God Poseidan,with all the powers that come with a demi God.His friend is actually a Satyr,half man and half goat.He also becomes friends with the daughter of the Goddess Athena and the son of Hermes.During training at the camp Hades appears and demands the lightning from Percy and in return promises to give him his mother back.Percy goes into action and on a quest to retrieve his mother,with his friends in tow.The son of Mercury gives Percy a map which reveals the location of three pearls which must be obtained in order to reach the underworld.Along the way they meet up with Medussa,a hydra and the lotus eaters who drug Percy and his friends into staying five days at one location,thereby losing precious time.In the underworld,after a ride over the river Styx with Charon,it is found Percy has had the lightning tucked away neatly in a shield he was given by Hermes son.It was a setup.Hades takes the lightning and is about to do Percy and the gang in when Persephone,his wife,takes it from him and knocks Hades out.With Percy's mother now back with him only three can return and his Satyr friend volunteers to stay behind.Back on top of the Empire State Building Percy is ambushed by Hermes son whom he defeats.Down to the last few seconds Percy arrives in the nick of time with the lightning on Mount Olympus and with the details of who took the lightning.Athena's daughter meets her mother for the first time and Zeus grants Poseidon some time with Percy.The film ends with Percy happily back in half blood camp.I found the story just does not pack the punch it should and while the action moves from one thing to the next to be sure,it has with no real twists or turns to keep one guessing.I also found Percy's disturbingly tepid reaction to his mothers death to be rather strange considering how close they were.The S/Fx as I have said are impressive throughout.I found Uma Thurman as Medusa to be a real stand out with her delicious modern take on that creature.The movie is quite clear and crisp and it is transferred into its original a/r of 2:35:1.Extras include deleted scenes,the trailer and a featurette on the movie.All in all an average movie that should have been better than it was but is still an enjoyable romp through Mount Olympus and back.Recommended.",3,An average romp with the Greek Gods,1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,3793,"['Percy', 'Jackson', 'Olympians', 'released',

Too many things were changed or omitted which totally changed the ""feel"" of the book.  The movie seemed rushed to cram a lot in, yet too many key topics were left out. First, the Luke-Kronos relationship was left out, which is the main plot of the 5 book series.

Example:  He walks down the hall of his school with a fight or two happening in the background, and his crutched friend and himself are casually going down the hall chatting.His mother and he live in a run-down apartment where she brings beer on command when her husband asks for it.  Wow, I'm marrying this gal!  The bum husband is not developed very well in the story and is in purely as a plot device.  Later in the film the relationship is further developed but predictable and silly.  Holy Mount Olympus!Meantime, back at the skyscraper (long story) Zeus and Poseidon (the king of the gods and the king of the sea, respectively) get angry with each other when Zeus accuses Poseidon's son (hey, Percy!) with stealing Zeus's source of power: a lightning bolt.  Pose has until the summer solstice to find out what's happening or else get the consequences.I mean, really now!  What proof?  Never explained.  Why does Poseidon walk in plain sight of everyone when he changes to human form?  Not explained.  So far so hole-ish....  :PAfter a particularly silly scene where Percy is learning about the Greeks in a museum but not paying attention with the ear buds from his iPod.  Gee, the irony.Then the magic happens.  His English teacher with the pinched face turns into a Harpy and demands the bolt.  I mean, you always knew your teachers were harpies, right?Pierce Brosnon is a guy in a wheelchair doing the Greek lecturing.  (Spoiler) we learn later that Pearce's character is really a centaur (half man, half horse) with the usual jokes of being a horse's ass.  (No, I'm not making this up).  (End spoiler)The inevitable mom gets kidnapped to Hell and Percy's quest, with the help of the daughter of Athena (who he sort of loves) and his crutched friend who turns out to be a satyr (mild sex jokes here) and they're off.If you know your Greek mythology you will be mildly insulted.  If you just want to watch a show of teenagers on a quest to deal with the devil, then you might enjoy a Friday night rental.The Medusa effects are interesting, turning people into stone.  But why did that woman grab Athena's daughter and bring her before Medusa only to herself turn into stone??  Sorry, thinking too much.  :PThe original Perseus vanquished Medusa and was the son of Zeus, but the film did not pretend to be faithful to the Greek myths.  There are some scenes where the sons and daughters of these mortal/immortal unions were at Camp Half-blood (very ""potter"" like) where they train all day and fight all day.  No explanation as to why or for what purpose they train.  They just like to have a boot camp for these kids I guess.The whole film plods on and on like this.  From what I understand the film is based on a series of four books by Rick Riordan.  I may pick up these young adult novels to see what the fuss is all about.Director Chris Columbus did a lot better with Harry Potter.  ""Percy Jackson"" has a lot of plot holes, very derivative and predictable storylines, subplots that make no sense, and leaves many unanswered questions.I'm hoping the books make more sense, but in my book, ""Percy Jackson"" is a failed attempt at not only a decent book to film adaptation, but leaves little to the imagination, more special effects than a Michael Bay movie and not much else.Better:Shall I say it?

1307805,A1GZ34D8AEE0SW,B002ZG98J6,"S. Stevenson ""FictionAddict""","[3, 8]","**If you have not read the books, this review DOES contain possible spoilers. If you have read them, then nothing here will be a surprise... hopefully.**As an avid Percy Jackson fan, I knew that I had to go and see any movie based off Rick Riordan's tremendous book series. And when I heard wind that THE LIGHTNING THIEF was indeed coming out to theaters on January 12th, I made sure to take work off and be ready to see the midnight showing. Now that I'm fresh off the movie, I thought I would sit down and share my thoughts on the movie directed by Harry Potter's own Chris Columbus.First off -- this is one of your basic book-to-movie adaptations. That said, some things HAVE to be cut for sake of time. I wouldn't mind watching five hours of one of my favorite books being turned into a movie, but I realize that most people can't sit still that long -- let alone the whole bathroom // eating situation. Unfortunately, a LOT of plot is cut from Riordan's first book in the series, leaving something that is still rich in and of itself, but is not quite as complex as the book. There are also a lot of subtle changes that will probably irk book purists: such as Annabeth's hair being brown instead of blonde, Annabeth's blue eyes vs. gray eyes, and Grover being African-American (which I LOVED). Set that aside, there are also a couple of major plot points that are skewed in order to fit the two hour time slot.One thing I will note is the fact that a couple of the early action scenes didn't seem as ""dangerous"" to me. I didn't feel like the characters were in as much danger as they were supposed to be. It seemed like pretty quick fixes altogether at the beginning, and I would have loved to see those battles drawn out just a bit.**MOVIE SPOILER**As a double warning, this section contains spoilers on the major plot of the movie. The main thing I missed from the book plot was the over-arching plot introduced in the series about the big prophecy and the children of the big three gods: Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. This plot was completely thrown out the window (for now anyway), and also Kronos is not barely even mentioned. The actual thief of the master bolt is changed, which didn't bother me as much, but definitely changed the dynamic of the storyline. To be honest, I wouldn't have minded if Columbus had just added on another 30 minutes to the movie and given us this storyline. I would have loved to watch more.**END MOVIE SPOILER**Okay -- my nit-picking aside, there were quite a few GOOD things to love about this movie. For instance, Uma Thurman's appearance as Medusa was inspired and insanely creepy, and definitely it goes down as one of my favorite sequences. The whole set-up of her Garden Emporium was downright freaky and definitely made me jump. The other great thing was actually the look of Camp Half-Blood. It is changed a bit from the books, but the realistic direction they tilted was perfect. Capture the flag was great, as well as a scene in the Nashville parthenon (which is quite changed from the book). Also, the manner in which they have to travel across the USA was a perfect plot improvement that changed encounters with monsters from random chance occurences and giving them a reason to have to face such horrible things.Acting-wise, there were only a couple clunker lines that kind of fell flat, but overall the cast did a fairly manageable job of their roles, with a few shining moments (such as Uma Thurman) thrown into the mix. Logan Lerman does a decent job portraying Percy, albeit a bit older than he is in the books, but that didn't bother me too much. To be perfectly honest, I don't quite know why they chose to change Annabeth so much at least in looks, but it ended up working out okay.THE LIGHTNING THIEF is definitely a good movie for families to enjoy, but do be aware for really little kids there are a couple pretty frightening scenes. My main advice is this: Forget the story you love in the book and go see the movie as a separate story altogether that uses characters and events from the books. Overall, with the time constraints that they had, the movie crew did a fairly good job of boiling down Riordan's book as best they could.Here's crossing my fingers for THE SEA OF MONSTERS...",4,Converse ALL-Star,1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,4247,"['**If', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'review', 'DOES', 'contain', 'possible', 'spoilers', 'have', 'read', 'then', 'nothing', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'surprise', 'hopefully', '**As', 'avid', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'fan', 'knew', 'had', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'based', 'off', 'Rick', 'Riordan', 'tremendous', 'book', 'series', 'when', 'heard', 'wind', 'THE', 'LIGHTNING', 'THIEF', 'was', 'indeed', 'coming', 'out', 'theaters', 'January', '12th', 'made', 'sure', 'take', 'work', 'off', 'be', 'ready', 'see', 'midnight', 'showing', 'Now', ""'m"", 'fresh', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'sit', 'down', 'share', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'directed', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'own', 'Chris', 'Columbus.First', 'off', 'one', 'basic', 'book-to-movie', 'adaptations', 'said', 'things', 'HAVE', 'be', 'cut', 'sake', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'five', 'hours', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'being', 'turned', 'movie', 'realize', 'most', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'still', 'long', 'let', 'alone', 'whole', 'bathroom', '//', 'eating', 'situation', 'Unfortunately', 'LOT', 'plot', 'cut', 'Riordan', 'first', 'book', 'series', 'leaving', 'something', 'still', 'rich', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'complex', 'book', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'subtle', 'changes', 'will', 'probably', 'irk', 'book', 'purists', 'such', 'Annabeth', 'hair', 'being', 'brown', 'instead', 'blonde', 'Annabeth', 'blue', 'eyes', 'vs.', 'gray', 'eyes', 'Grover', 'being', 'African-American', 'LOVED', 'aside', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'skewed', 'order', 'fit', 'two', 'hour', 'time', 'slot.One', 'thing', 'will', 'note', 'fact', 'couple', 'early', 'action', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'dangerous', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'characters', 'were', 'as', 'much', 'danger', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'quick', 'fixes', 'altogether', 'beginning', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'battles', 'drawn', 'out', 'just', 'bit', '**MOVIE', 'SPOILER**As', 'double', 'warning', 'section', 'spoilers', 'major', 'plot', 'movie', 'main', 'thing', 'missed', 'book', 'plot', 'was', 'over-arching', 'plot', 'introduced', 'series', 'big', 'prophecy', 'children', 'big', 'three', 'gods', 'Zeus', 'Poseidon', 'Hades', 'plot', 'was', 'completely', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'now', 'anyway', 'also', 'Kronos', 'not', 'barely', 'even', 'mentioned', 'actual', 'thief', 'master', 'bolt', 'changed', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'much', 'definitely', 'changed', 'dynamic', 'storyline', 'be', 'honest', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'minded', 'Columbus', 'had', 'just', 'added', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'given', 'storyline', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'watch', 'more', '**END', 'MOVIE', 'SPOILER**Okay', 'nit-picking', 'aside', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'GOOD', 'things', 'love', 'movie', 'instance', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'appearance', 'Medusa', 'was', 'inspired', 'insanely', 'creepy', 'definitely', 'down', 'one', 'favorite', 'sequences', 'whole', 'set-up', 'Garden', 'Emporium', 'was', 'downright', 'freaky', 'definitely', 'made', 'jump', 'other', 'great', 'thing', 'was', 'actually', 'look', 'Camp', 'Half-Blood', 'changed', 'bit', 'books', 'realistic', 'direction', 'tilted', 'was', 'perfect', 'Capture', 'flag', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'scene', 'Nashville', 'parthenon', 'quite', 'changed', 'book', 'Also', 'manner', 'have', 'travel', 'USA', 'was', 'perfect', 'plot', 'improvement', 'changed', 'encounters', 'monsters', 'random', 'chance', 'occurences', 'giving', 'reason', 'have', 'face', 'such', 'horrible', 'things.Acting-wise', 'were', 'only', 'couple', 'clunker', 'lines', 'kind', 'fell', 'flat', 'cast', 'did', 'fairly', 'manageable', 'job', 'roles', 'few', 'shining', 'moments', 'such', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'thrown', 'mix', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'decent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Percy', 'bit', 'older', 'books', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'why', 'chose', 'change', 'Annabeth', 'so', 'much', 'least', 'looks', 'ended', 'up', 'working', 'out', 'LIGHTNING', 'THIEF', 'definitely', 'good', 'movie', 'families', 'enjoy', 'do', 'be', 'aware', 'really', 'little', 'kids', 'are', 'couple', 'pretty', 'frightening', 'scenes', 'main', 'advice', 'Forget', 'story', 'love', 'book', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'separate', 'story', 'altogether', 'characters', 'events', 'books', 'Overall', 'time', 'constraints', 'had', 'movie', 'crew', 'did', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'boiling', 'down', 'Riordan', 'book', 'best', 'could.Here', 'crossing', 'fingers', 'THE', 'SEA', 'OF', 'MONSTERS']",N/A

However, the movie still was made as though for younger teens and kids.The relationship between Percy and Annabeth was ruined. Yeah it was turned into a sorta romance, with Annabeth being a ridiculously stereotypical 'tough' female who's always second best to the male characters and has a crush on Percy even though she pretends to hate him.The water park scene was left out. So was the scene where they're attacked by monsters on the bus. So was the fight with the monsters on the bridge!Instead of the plot being the kids trying to get safely to LA, it was them trying to get safely to LA and find the pearls in different places. In the book the pearls aren't made a big deal of.The Medusa head; oh, oh. This is a PG movie. I don't see why a severed head, sometimes with it's eyes open, had to be flaunted for the camera every five seconds. In a scene never in the book, they fight a hydra, and win by turning it to stone. They also have to flee a hotel because someone sees it. Grover kisses the thing after it kills the hydra. And it isn't ever sent to Mt. Olympus. Nor does it quite play the same part at the end; instead Gabe opens the fridge and finds it (which is during the credits). Medusa's character is also nothing like in the book.Instead of the villain being who it is in the book, it's Hades. How stereotypical and expected is that? The underworld in the book follows mythology well; in the movie it's just shown as being hell. Uncreative! In the movie we meet Persephone, who we are given to understand hates Hades, hates the underworld, and is desperate for sex with people other than her husband. Chiron wasn't funny like in the book; obviously Hades wasn't anything like in the book. The dog didn't have a part at all - no, we didn't get to see a three headed dog play fetch! The way Riordan wrote about the underworld was so original and entertaining; the movie just presented an un-educated stereotype.Percy doesn't encounter the bullies at the camp, nor is there the awesome exploding toilet scene.We never meet the guy who is responsible, in the book, for having the lightening stolen.We are given to understand that the kid who stole the lightening for Hades did so because his father, a god, never paid attention to him. In the movie, the gods are forbidden to have anything to do with their offspring, unlike the book. The whole `big three' and the results of them having children is never mentioned.The showdown at the end is between Percy and Luke. The titan is never mentioned.Instead of Percy's mom staying behind, and being freed because of Percy recovering the helmet, Grover stays behind, and is magically released by Zeus.The reason this is getting a 3 star rating is because the casting was mostly good, the acting also mostly good, and the action was very exciting. I wouldn't bring a young child to see this - It wasn't the scary images that surprised me as the fact that there were so MANY scary scenes. For teens and adults, I think these just add to the excitement of the movie, but if you don't like intense scenes, be warned. And again I think some of these scenes, especially the severed head, would be very, very frightening to some children. Despite this, the script was written as though aimed at pre-teens.Well the special effects were awesome if very overdone at times, but you will cringe if you read the book.",3,Fans of the Book BEWARE,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,3961,"['Lightening', 'Thief', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'butchered', 'NOTE', 'have', 'seen', 'worse', 'jobs', 'done', 'including', 'movie', 'where', 'heroine', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'turned', 'villian', 'killed', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'GREAT', 'movie', ""'d"", 'followed', 'book', 'more.Now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'really', 'good', 'informative', 'review', 'spoilers', '.DIFFERENCES', 'THE', 'BOOK', 'may', 'be', 'pretty', 'cryptic', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'preview', 'noticed', 'kids', 'are', 'late', 'teens', 'instead', 'pre-teens', 'However', 'movie', 'still', 'was', 'made', 'younger', 'teens', 'kids.The', 'relationship', 'Percy', 'Annabeth', 'was', 'ruined', 'Yeah', 'was', 'turned', 'sorta', 'romance', 'Annabeth', 'being', 'ridiculously', 'stereotypical', 'female', 'who', 'always', 'second', 'best', 'male', 'characters', 'crush', 'Percy', 'even', 'hate', 'him.The', 'water', 'park', 'scene', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'So', 'was', 'scene', 'where', ""'re"", 'attacked', 'monsters', 'bus', 'was', 'fight', 'monsters', 'bridge', 'Instead', 'plot', 'being', 'kids', 'trying', 'get', 'safely', 'LA', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'safely', 'LA', 'find', 'pearls', 'different', 'places', 'book', 'pearls', 'are', ""n't"", 'made', 'big', 'deal', 'of.The', 'Medusa', 'head', 'oh', 'oh', 'PG', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'severed', 'head', 'sometimes', 'eyes', 'open', 'had', 'be', 'flaunted', 'camera', 'five', 'seconds', 'scene', 'never', 'book', 'fight', 'hydra', 'win', 'turning', 'stone', 'also', 'have', 'flee', 'hotel', 'someone', 'Grover', 'thing', 'hydra', ""n't"", 'ever', 'sent', 'Mt', 'Olympus', 'quite', 'play', 'same', 'part', 'end', 'instead', 'Gabe', 'fridge', 'credits', 'Medusa', 'character', 'also', 'nothing', 'book.Instead', 'villain', 'being', 'who', 'book', 'Hades', 'How', 'stereotypical', 'expected', 'underworld', 'book', 'mythology', 'well', 'movie', 'just', 'shown', 'being', 'hell', 'Uncreative', 'movie', 'meet', 'Persephone', 'who', 'are', 'given', 'understand', 'hates', 'Hades', 'underworld', 'desperate', 'sex', 'people', 'other', 'husband', 'Chiron', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'book', 'obviously', 'Hades', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'book', 'dog', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'three', 'headed', 'dog', 'play', 'fetch', 'way', 'Riordan', 'wrote', 'underworld', 'was', 'so', 'original', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'just', 'presented', 'un-educated', 'stereotype.Percy', ""n't"", 'encounter', 'bullies', 'camp', 'awesome', 'exploding', 'toilet', 'scene.We', 'never', 'meet', 'guy', 'who', 'responsible', 'book', 'having', 'lightening', 'stolen.We', 'are', 'given', 'understand', 'kid', 'who', 'stole', 'lightening', 'Hades', 'did', 'so', 'father', 'god', 'never', 'paid', 'attention', 'movie', 'gods', 'are', 'forbidden', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'offspring', 'book', 'whole', 'big', 'three', 'results', 'having', 'children', 'never', 'mentioned.The', 'showdown', 'end', 'Percy', 'Luke', 'titan', 'never', 'mentioned.Instead', 'Percy', 'mom', 'staying', 'being', 'freed', 'Percy', 'recovering', 'helmet', 'Grover', 'magically', 'released', 'Zeus.The', 'reason', 'getting', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'casting', 'was', 'mostly', 'good', 'acting', 'also', 'mostly', 'good', 'action', 'was', 'very', 'exciting', 'would', ""n't"", 'bring', 'young', 'child', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'images', 'surprised', 'fact', 'were', 'so', 'MANY', 'scary', 'scenes', 'teens', 'adults', 'think', 'just', 'add', 'excitement', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'intense', 'scenes', 'be', 'warned', 'again', 'think', 'scenes', 'especially', 'severed', 'head', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'frightening', 'children', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'aimed', 'pre-teens.Well', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'awesome', 'very', 'overdone', 'times', 'will', 'cringe', 'read', 'book']",N/A

1307825,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B002ZG98J6,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[1, 3]","Movie - 3.5I've never read the books, I haven't read or seen any Harry Potter, and I still haven't seen Lord of the Rings at this point, so I'm not ""over-sensitized"" by the fantasy genre like some people may be. But I did recently see The Last Airbender, which is a total desecration to its source material. And I have to say, with that heap of garbage in mind, The Lightning Thief blows it out of the water in comparison. Lightning Thief is a PG movie, which doesn't bother me at all, as I personally think the rating has come to allow a lot more these days in terms of content. Any fan of the original or remake of Clash of the Titans should be able to pick up on a lot of the similarities in terms of screenplay and parts of the plot. And, it just so happens I've coincidentally had quite a bit of exposure to both versions of Clash, as well as Jason and the Argonauts within the last few days of this review, making this transition relatively smooth. When I first saw the trailer, the concept struck me as a modernized version of old Greek tales, though much more geared towards the young teen demographic. After eventually having my fair share of the Harryhausen classics and Leterrier's action-ized revision, I have to say Lightning Thief actually makes for a good dose of family entertainment. It never takes itself too seriously, has a fairly light atmosphere between all the protagonists, and manages to tell a decently-paced adventure story. The script runs a bit on the generic side and the child actors don't get much room to show any real potential, but I like the casting of the adults. Sean Bean, Pierce Brosnan, Steve Coogan, and Kevin McKidd add a good deal of maturity, and even a little poetic savvy with what little screen time they actually get. The film probably won't garner too much praise for originality, but if the mood ever strikes you for an effects-laden fantasy film, Lightning Thief wouldn't make for a bad choice.Video - 4.5Lightning Thief presents itself on BD with excellent quality. The cinematography has a peculiar ""darkness"" to it that makes for some very bold colors. Greens and blues stick out the most and look very lush early on in the film with a chromatic progression towards more reds, grays, and blacks around the end. Black levels are deep and don't suffer any instances of crush, despite the photography, and contrast is very good at accentuating the actors' faces, as well as the fine prop and set designs. The special effects look especially pleasing with some pretty seamless integration of CG and visual staging. Two parts that I really like are the trip into Hades for its eerie and fearsome depiction, which I think was rather scary for a PG film, and the scene where Percy starts to realize the greatness of his power by summoning up a couple of pretty big tidal waves. And while the image is relatively sharp, the dark photography does manage to lose a little bit of detail in some of the low-lit scenes. Otherwise, the picture is nearly flawless.Audio - 5.0While the video may be just a tad off, the audio quality for Lightning Thief is flawless. Dialogue is crisp through the center, while high and low ends give off great fidelity. Being a fairly robust action film with a good deal of sound effects, directionality and separation are spot on. Mythical creatures, clashing weapons, and magical energies pop all across the sound stage with proper panning from left to right, right left, front to back, etc. when the action calls for it. Little things like shuffling feet on terrain, snake hair, flames, and water ripples help in showcasing the subtleties of the track. The score by Christophe Beck immerses with a very balanced plethora of orchestral pieces and adds that extra sense of depth to the adventure and action. But the real beast of the audio is bass. LFEs range from low and constant to absolutely booming. A good indicator of what to expect for a majority of the film should be from the get-go where we see Zeus introduced as his thunder rumbles in the night New York skies. From there on out, it's reference audio.Extras - 2.0Not a whole lot, here. No commentary track, 14 minutes of deleted scenes, a couple of interactive games that are nothing more than window dressing, and only about 20 minutes of making-of or behind-the-scenes featurettes. We get very brief interviews with various important persons like the director, the creator of the novels, the composer, and the three main child actors, but that's it.Overall - 4.0Lightning Thief is innocent and harmless fun that's definitely geared for PG audiences and family atmospheres alike. It's not the most original of fantasy tales, but what do you expect from a guy that was just trying to make up a bedtime story for his kid? I'm sure there's a lot of depth missing from the books that would certainly add to the plot, characters, and everything else, but I personally find this to be a better film than another piece of crap that came out the same year. With excellent video, reference audio, though a meager set of extras, Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief comes recommended.",4,Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief

1307828,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002ZG98J6,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 2]","Yet another adaptation of fantasy novel, ""Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief"" is pretty decent as mindless entertainment, but still a slight disappointment, considering the film is helmed by Chris Columbus, director of the first two installments of ""Harry Potter"" franchise. ""Percy Jackson"" is nice to look at (with Uma Thurman as campy snake-headed Medusa), but it lacks something that makes a truly thrilling adventure tale.Gods and goddesses of Greek mythology really live. The film's story is set in today's America, where an ordinary high school boy Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman), who is actually son of Poseidon, is accused of stealing the lightning bolt of Zeus (Sean Bean). Percy doesn't know anything about the theft. In fact, he didn't know anything about his lineage until he is attacked by a winged creature and is saved by his best friend Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) and mysterious teacher Mr. Brunner (Pierce Brosnan).The setting is unique (I like Mick Jagger-ish Hades played by Steve Coogan), and the special effects are reasonable, but you may not find wisecracking Grover very funny. I haven't read the original books by Rick Riordan, but even so, I can see considerable changes have been done to the source material. The story and the character development both are weak and underwritten. So what does Percy really want to do, save the world or his mother? What is the point of stealing Zeus's lightning in the first place?The two-hour film, of which script is unfocused at best, fails to build up the necessary tension that is essential to the storyline. The film has interesting fantasy elements - Zeus' warning on global-scale war, romance of Percy's mother, Percy's potential as a demigod - but none of them really rings true.

Few movies from any era can hold their own against some of those modern classics. So, in fairness to this movie, I address it in its own terms only.On the whole, those are pretty good terms. It delivers a wicked stepfather we love to hate, a chaste bit of teen romance with a decidedly un-wimpy female character, good effects (esp. faun and centaur), and exciting adventure. Things have been toned down a bit, for example around the bloodlessness of the fight scenes. I read that as an appeal to a younger, more skittish viewing audience than as real weakness, however. And, although I'm not up on the Greek myths to which it refers, I'm told that it stays close to the classics even when they aren't referenced explicitly. My brother, who had the old stories more freshly in mind, said that the movie's faithfulness to the classics actually made it predictable in a few places. My own objections tend to the more mundane, like wouldn't it raise a few eyebrows to see vast stone sculptures appear overnight in public places? Well, part of the appeal of teen movies lies in the stupidity of the adults involved.Hardly the epic that some viewers seem to expect, this is still a fine bit of popcorn entertainment. It treats the old stories with reasonable respect while rising to high standards of modern moviemaking. Even if it's not one to remember ten years from now (or even one, maybe), it's easy to enjoy in itself.- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release",4,Enjoyable fantasy/adventure,1267142400,"02 26, 2010",2010,1673,"[""'Thief"", 'enters', 'tough', 'market', 'expectations', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'series', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'including', 'others', 'focus', 'education', 'teenaged', 'protagonist', 'Few', 'movies', 'era', 'can', 'hold', 'own', 'modern', 'classics', 'So', 'fairness', 'movie', 'address', 'own', 'terms', 'only.On', 'whole', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'terms', 'wicked', 'stepfather', 'love', 'hate', 'chaste', 'bit', 'teen', 'romance', 'decidedly', 'un-wimpy', 'female', 'character', 'good', 'effects', 'esp', 'faun', 'centaur', 'exciting', 'adventure', 'Things', 'have', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'bit', 'example', 'bloodlessness', 'fight', 'scenes', 'read', 'appeal', 'younger', 'more', 'skittish', 'viewing', 'audience', 'real', 'weakness', 'however', ""'m"", 'not', 'up', 'Greek', 'myths', ""'m"", 'told', 'close', 'classics', 'even', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'referenced', 'explicitly', 'brother', 'who', 'had', 'old', 'stories', 'more', 'freshly', 'mind', 'said', 'movie', 'faithfulness', 'classics', 'actually', 'made', 'predictable', 'few', 'places', 'own', 'objections', 'tend', 'more', 'mundane', 'like', 'would', ""n't"", 'raise', 'few', 'eyebrows', 'see', 'vast', 'stone', 'sculptures', 'appear', 'overnight', 'public', 'places', 'Well', 'part', 'appeal', 'teen', 'movies', 'stupidity', 'adults', 'involved.Hardly', 'epic', 'viewers', 'seem', 'expect', 'still', 'fine', 'bit', 'popcorn', 'entertainment', 'old', 'stories', 'reasonable', 'respect', 'rising', 'high', 'standards', 'modern', 'moviemaking', 'Even', 'not', 'one', 'remember', 'ten', 'years', 'now', 'even', 'one', 'maybe', 'easy', 'enjoy', 'itself.-', 'wiredweird', 'reviewing', 'theatrical', 'release']",N/A
