The film boasts all around fine acting, but it is Ambrose who truly shines.She dives into her character of a recently widowed, orthodox Jewish woman and, like Streep, becomes her- body and soul. Leah is looking for love and personal fulfillment, but she is out of her element, away from her family and community and far from the familiar. Via Ambrose's subtle yet effective movements, expressions, and body language, she creates a multi-layered, complex character that could have been a cardboard cliche. Instead, we feel her loneliness, her awkwardness, her pain and finally, her joy.Ambrose is given strong support by Susie Essman, playing her overbearing, yet sympathetic mother and Mercedes Ruehl, who makes a large impression even in a small role. Adam Kaufman is also fine as her reluctant ""husband"" and he and Ambrose have wonderful on screen chemistry.""Loving Leah"", although steeped in a particular culture and milieu, has enormous universal appeal.

1252028,AEJ51LB0XGGY,B0026RX2VE,"Jaroslav Melgr ""jaroski""","[2, 3]","This is a contemporary movie about a Jewish cardiologist from D.C. Jake whose brother Benjamin, an orthodox rabbi from New York dies leaving behind a childless widow.  According to Deuteronomy 25:5-10 the deceased's nearest relative is to take the widow and raise a seed to him.  This law, which is called the levirate law of marriage is also a foundation for the biblical story of Ruth.Jake is not a religious Jew and does not really have a clue about Jewish law, ceremonies or traditions.  So when he's approached by the rabbis about either marrying his sister-in-law Leah or denouncing his brother's existence, he's rather caught off guard.  But in any case he's not ready to denounce the existence of his older brother who was his childhood hero growing up and to whom Jake looked up to so much until Benjamin moved out.  He just can't do it.  So despite the fact that he's about to get engaged to someone else, he agrees to ""marry"" his brother's widow Leah.  The agreement Jake and Leah strike is to have her live with him in D.C. as if they were married.  He figures once they're away they'll figure it out and she can then live on her own and do whatever she'd like.  So to the surprise of everyone, they ask the rabbis to marry them and get on their way.Back in D.C. Jake sets up room for Leah in his apartment and then tries to explain it to his girlfriend, who's obviously not very understanding.  However, Jake goes on living his busy life of a single cardiologist, being hardly home at all.  Leah in the mean time, as a good orthodox Jewish wife tries to make the apartment a good and welcoming home -- even though she understands that Jake has a life of his own and a girlfriend, she tries to cook and clean up, looking forward to have Jake come home for dinner and a chat and enjoy her cooking.  But he never shows up.  So she starts exploring the neighborhood to kill some time during the day and finds a Reformed synagogue with a female rabbi where she finds friendship and comfort despite the fact that the reformed Jews are the polar opposite of orthodox Jews.Leah's discussions with the female rabbi bring up an interesting and humorous flop that the movie producers obviously did not catch.  After hearing Leah's story the lady rabbi (played by a Christian actress) tries to relate to Leah and tells her that when she was young she frequently broke the Sabbath by ""going to the movies on Sundays."" Oops.Anyway, by and by Leah and Jake starting to like each other and after a visit by Leah mother and several confrontations between Jake and his girlfriend, Leah and Jake fall in love.It's a nice and touching story and a rare find these days.  Lauren Ambrose, actress playing Leah does a fantastic job!  Her performance is one of those terrific ones deserving serious credit.  Besides her performance, I like the fact that the story focuses on keeping one's faith despite adverse circumstances.  Even when away from her orthodox community, Leah continues to hold on to her faith and traditions and tries to awaken it in Jake.  In many movies today, the believer often abandons his or her faith to be ""happy"" with someone else on the outside, which is a wrong message in my opinion.  So I applaud the fact that this movie sends the right message.The thing that I think is weak about the movie is Jake's character.  He seems to be so ambivalent and shallow about his emotions.  Instead of being torn he simply likes Leah when he's with her and then likes his girlfriend when she's around....  There does not seem to be any internal tension one would expect.  Anyway, I think that this is where the story could have been developed better and would have added to the overall quality.  But I would still highly recommend the movie to anyone as it is a very nice, touching and enjoyable story.",5,Great story of levirate marriage blosoming into love,1313020800,"08 11, 2011",2011,3806,"['contemporary', 'movie', 'Jewish', 'cardiologist', 'D.C.', 'Jake', 'brother', 'Benjamin', 'orthodox', 'rabbi', 'New', 'York', 'leaving', 'childless', 'widow', 'According', 'Deuteronomy', '25:5-10', 'deceased', 'nearest', 'relative', 'take', 'widow', 'raise', 'seed', 'law', 'called', 'levirate', 'law', 'marriage', 'also', 'foundation', 'biblical', 'story', 'Ruth.Jake', 'not', 'religious', 'Jew', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'clue', 'Jewish', 'law', 'ceremonies', 'traditions', 'So', 'when', 'approached', 'rabbis', 'marrying', 'sister-in-law', 'Leah', 'denouncing', 'brother', 'existence', 'rather', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'case', 'not', 'ready', 'denounce', 'existence', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'was', 'childhood', 'hero', 'growing', 'up', 'whom', 'Jake', 'looked', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'Benjamin', 'moved', 'out', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'So', 'fact', 'get', 'engaged', 'someone', 'else', 'marry', 'brother', 'widow', 'Leah', 'agreement', 'Jake', 'Leah', 'strike', 'have', 'live', 'D.C.', 'were', 'married', 'once', ""'re"", 'away', ""'ll"", 'figure', 'out', 'can', 'then', 'live', 'own', 'do', ""'d"", 'like', 'So', 'surprise', 'everyone', 'ask', 'rabbis', 'marry', 'get', 'way.Back', 'D.C.', 'Jake', 'up', 'room', 'Leah', 'apartment', 'then', 'explain', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'obviously', 'not', 'very', 'understanding', 'However', 'Jake', 'living', 'busy', 'life', 'single', 'cardiologist', 'being', 'hardly', 'home', 'Leah', 'mean', 'time', 'good', 'orthodox', 'Jewish', 'wife', 'tries', 'make', 'apartment', 'good', 'welcoming', 'home', 'even', 'Jake', 'life', 'own', 'girlfriend', 'cook', 'clean', 'up', 'looking', 'forward', 'have', 'Jake', 'come', 'home', 'dinner', 'chat', 'enjoy', 'cooking', 'never', 'up', 'exploring', 'neighborhood', 'kill', 'time', 'day', 'Reformed', 'synagogue', 'female', 'rabbi', 'where', 'friendship', 'comfort', 'fact', 'reformed', 'Jews', 'are', 'polar', 'opposite', 'orthodox', 'Jews.Leah', 'discussions', 'female', 'rabbi', 'bring', 'up', 'interesting', 'humorous', 'flop', 'movie', 'producers', 'obviously', 'did', 'not', 'catch', 'hearing', 'Leah', 'story', 'lady', 'rabbi', 'played', 'Christian', 'actress', 'relate', 'Leah', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'frequently', 'broke', 'Sabbath', 'going', 'movies', 'Sundays', 'Oops.Anyway', 'Leah', 'Jake', 'starting', 'like', 'other', 'visit', 'Leah', 'mother', 'several', 'confrontations', 'Jake', 'girlfriend', 'Leah', 'Jake', 'fall', 'love.It', 'nice', 'touching', 'story', 'rare', 'days', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'actress', 'playing', 'Leah', 'fantastic', 'job', 'performance', 'one', 'terrific', 'ones', 'deserving', 'serious', 'credit', 'performance', 'like', 'fact', 'story', 'keeping', 'one', 'faith', 'adverse', 'circumstances', 'Even', 'when', 'away', 'orthodox', 'community', 'Leah', 'hold', 'faith', 'traditions', 'tries', 'awaken', 'Jake', 'many', 'movies', 'today', 'believer', 'often', 'faith', 'be', 'happy', 'someone', 'else', 'outside', 'wrong', 'message', 'opinion', 'applaud', 'fact', 'movie', 'right', 'message.The', 'thing', 'think', 'weak', 'movie', 'Jake', 'character', 'be', 'so', 'ambivalent', 'shallow', 'emotions', 'Instead', 'being', 'torn', 'simply', 'Leah', 'when', 'then', 'likes', 'girlfriend', 'when', 'around', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'internal', 'tension', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Anyway', 'think', 'where', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'overall', 'quality', 'would', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'very', 'nice', 'touching', 'enjoyable', 'story']",Loving Leah: Hallmark Hall of Fame Gold Crown Collector's Edition

1252035,A2GZVA22WYG95I,B0026RX2VE,J. Olsen,"[35, 35]","Here we have the age-old theme of a marriage of convenience, and we all know what happens to those in most fictional settings. But the twists and turns this story takes along the way make it an entertaining journey. The characters are colorful and interesting, from the stereotypical Jewish mother, to the outspoken housekeeper that befriends Leah. It is fun to see Leah find herself as she moves away from the Orthodox community, but that in and of itself may present a problem for some viewers. The idea that she has to compromise the teachings of her faith to find happiness may not set well with everyone, though her own mother does appear to eventually come to terms with it.But the story isn't all smooth sailing. The handsome young doctor marries his sister-in-law because otherwise he would have had to participate in a ceremony that would have denied the existence of his brother, whom he had loved deeply as a child, but hadn't found common ground with as an adult before he died. His fiancee is not too happy with the new arrangement and issues an ultimatum. He promises to tell Leah that she needs to move out, but can't seem to find the right moment. When he finally realizes he loves Leah he struggles with feelings that he is somehow betraying his brother by doing so. That is when Leah decides to leave him.*Spoiler Alert*When you see the picture on the cover it seems that is spoiler enough, but in case that didn't give it away for you, they do eventually work out their issues and get back together for real. So if you would enjoy a story where a sweet, unassuming, but sometimes feisty young woman wins the affection of a successful and attractive young doctor, then this may be right up your alley.Pretty much family friendly--there are a couple of kissing scenes that lean toward the passionate side. They do share a bed in one scene when they are trying to convince Leah's mother that they are ""really married"", but they are fully pajama-clad, have pillows as a barrier between them--and, after all, they are married. When they do finally realize they love each other you see them in the kitchen doorway in a passionate embrace one minute and the next thing you see is Leah coming out of his bedroom in her nightie the next morning as he is fixing her breakfast. The implication is clear that now they are ""really married.""An earlier reviewer quoted some favorite lines--I'll add another one.""Dude, it was so much easier when you dated non-relatives.""",5,"Sure, the ending is predictable, but it is fun getting there",1251417600,"08 28, 2009",2009,2474,"['Here', 'have', 'age-old', 'theme', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'know', 'what', 'most', 'fictional', 'settings', 'twists', 'story', 'way', 'make', 'entertaining', 'journey', 'characters', 'are', 'colorful', 'interesting', 'stereotypical', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'outspoken', 'housekeeper', 'Leah', 'fun', 'see', 'Leah', 'find', 'away', 'Orthodox', 'community', 'may', 'present', 'problem', 'viewers', 'idea', 'compromise', 'teachings', 'faith', 'find', 'happiness', 'may', 'not', 'set', 'well', 'everyone', 'own', 'mother', 'appear', 'eventually', 'come', 'terms', 'it.But', 'story', ""n't"", 'smooth', 'sailing', 'handsome', 'young', 'doctor', 'sister-in-law', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'participate', 'ceremony', 'would', 'have', 'denied', 'existence', 'brother', 'whom', 'had', 'loved', 'deeply', 'child', 'had', ""n't"", 'found', 'common', 'ground', 'adult', 'died', 'fiancee', 'not', 'too', 'happy', 'new', 'arrangement', 'issues', 'ultimatum', 'tell', 'Leah', 'move', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'right', 'moment', 'When', 'finally', 'feelings', 'somehow', 'betraying', 'brother', 'doing', 'so', 'when', 'Leah', 'leave', '*Spoiler', 'Alert*When', 'see', 'picture', 'cover', 'spoiler', 'enough', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'do', 'eventually', 'work', 'out', 'issues', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'real', 'So', 'would', 'enjoy', 'story', 'where', 'sweet', 'unassuming', 'sometimes', 'feisty', 'young', 'woman', 'affection', 'successful', 'attractive', 'young', 'doctor', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'alley.Pretty', 'much', 'family', 'friendly', 'are', 'couple', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'lean', 'passionate', 'side', 'do', 'share', 'bed', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'are', 'trying', 'convince', 'Leah', 'mother', 'are', 'really', 'married', 'are', 'fully', 'pajama-clad', 'have', 'pillows', 'barrier', 'are', 'married', 'When', 'do', 'finally', 'realize', 'love', 'other', 'see', 'kitchen', 'doorway', 'passionate', 'embrace', 'one', 'minute', 'next', 'thing', 'see', 'Leah', 'coming', 'bedroom', 'nightie', 'next', 'morning', 'fixing', 'breakfast', 'implication', 'clear', 'now', 'are', 'really', 'married', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'quoted', 'favorite', 'lines', ""'ll"", 'add', 'one', 'Dude', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'when', 'dated', 'non-relatives']",Loving Leah: Hallmark Hall of Fame Gold Crown Collector's Edition

Lauren Ambrose was very sweet and touching as Leah, and her character development was quite entertaining. It was very pleasant watching Leah adapt to her 'new' surroundings and situation, and gradually fall in love with Jake, her nominal husband, in spite of their differences.There were some things that I find unbelievable however. The levirate marriage tradition (yibbum) is now largely obsolete even among the Orthodox community. The purpose of the levirate marriage was to produce an heir for the deceased brother, so for the surviving brother to propose a 'show marriage' in name only, while he continued a relationship with his girlfriend, would not fulfill the biblical mandate, and would not be likely to be accepted by an observant Orthodox widow. And the widow has the right to reject the proposed marriage. I also question whether the Beit Din of Orthodox Rabbis would not have delved into Jake's motives for marrying the widow, since levirate marriage is now virtually unheard of. European Jewish Rabbis essentially banned yibbum, since the few men who went forward with it did so only either if the widow was particularly beautiful, or the brother left a large estate - both unacceptable. And Jake would only have to renounce his obligation to provide an heir for his brother - not renounce the brother himself.I seriously doubt whether Leah would have doffed her wig for the formal party Jake invited her to, after Jake and his girlfriend broke up. Orthodox women only show their hair to their spouse and immediate family. While she might have let Jake see her hair at that point, I really doubt she'd have gone out in public that way. In one sense, letting Jake see her natural hair would be a way of saying Leah recognized him as a true husband, not a 'show' husband - which was sweet and touching - though Jake's character might not have realized the implications. And don't get me started on Jake and Leah sharing a bed, at the point they did - even with pillows between them.Still the movie and emotions were very touching, sweet, and pleasant, and it was fun watching Leah and Jake slowly realize they were falling in love with each other.",5,Very sweet movie,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,2272,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'escapist', 'romance', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'overall', 'plot', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'was', 'very', 'sweet', 'touching', 'Leah', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'was', 'very', 'pleasant', 'watching', 'Leah', 'adapt', ""'new"", 'surroundings', 'situation', 'gradually', 'fall', 'love', 'Jake', 'nominal', 'husband', 'spite', 'differences.There', 'were', 'things', 'find', 'unbelievable', 'however', 'levirate', 'marriage', 'tradition', 'yibbum', 'now', 'largely', 'obsolete', 'even', 'Orthodox', 'community', 'purpose', 'levirate', 'marriage', 'was', 'produce', 'heir', 'deceased', 'brother', 'so', 'surviving', 'brother', 'propose', ""'show"", 'marriage', 'name', 'only', 'continued', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'would', 'not', 'fulfill', 'biblical', 'mandate', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'likely', 'be', 'accepted', 'observant', 'Orthodox', 'widow', 'widow', 'right', 'reject', 'proposed', 'marriage', 'also', 'question', 'Beit', 'Din', 'Orthodox', 'Rabbis', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'delved', 'Jake', 'motives', 'marrying', 'widow', 'levirate', 'marriage', 'now', 'virtually', 'unheard', 'European', 'Jewish', 'Rabbis', 'essentially', 'banned', 'yibbum', 'few', 'men', 'who', 'went', 'forward', 'did', 'so', 'only', 'widow', 'was', 'particularly', 'beautiful', 'brother', 'left', 'large', 'estate', 'unacceptable', 'Jake', 'would', 'only', 'have', 'renounce', 'obligation', 'provide', 'heir', 'brother', 'not', 'renounce', 'brother', 'himself.I', 'seriously', 'Leah', 'would', 'have', 'doffed', 'wig', 'formal', 'party', 'Jake', 'invited', 'Jake', 'girlfriend', 'broke', 'up', 'Orthodox', 'women', 'only', 'show', 'hair', 'spouse', 'immediate', 'family', 'might', 'have', 'let', 'Jake', 'see', 'hair', 'point', 'really', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'have', 'gone', 'out', 'public', 'way', 'one', 'sense', 'letting', 'Jake', 'see', 'natural', 'hair', 'would', 'be', 'way', 'saying', 'Leah', 'recognized', 'true', 'husband', 'not', ""'show"", 'husband', 'was', 'sweet', 'touching', 'Jake', 'character', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'realized', 'implications', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'Jake', 'Leah', 'sharing', 'bed', 'point', 'did', 'even', 'pillows', 'movie', 'emotions', 'were', 'very', 'touching', 'sweet', 'pleasant', 'was', 'fun', 'watching', 'Leah', 'Jake', 'slowly', 'realize', 'were', 'falling', 'love', 'other']",Loving Leah: Hallmark Hall of Fame Gold Crown Collector's Edition
