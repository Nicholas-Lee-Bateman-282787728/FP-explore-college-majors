1404781,A1K69BBLY0NVOW,B004F88HZI,nowyat,"[28, 30]","Junjou Romantica is the most popular yaoi/shounen-ai anime of all time.  Eighteen year-old Misaki is first tutored by, then goes to live with the 28 year-old Usami. Usami had hopelessly been fond of Misaki's older brother for many years, but when he meets Misaki he finds true love at last.  The super-wealthy, highly intellectual background of Usami clashes with the working class background of the young student.  Misaki, who, blaming himself for the loss of his parents as a child, is obsessed with not causing trouble for others, while Usami comes from an arrogant and dysfunctional socially elite family, but the two blend together to make a couple and overcome the obstacles their families put in their way. Full of humour and drama, plus some side-stories, this anime is worth watching.",5,Pure Romance...,1298764800,"02 27, 2011",2011,793,"['Junjou', 'Romantica', 'most', 'popular', 'yaoi/shounen-ai', 'anime', 'time', 'Eighteen', 'year-old', 'Misaki', 'first', 'tutored', 'then', 'live', '28', 'year-old', 'Usami', 'Usami', 'had', 'hopelessly', 'been', 'fond', 'Misaki', 'older', 'brother', 'many', 'years', 'when', 'Misaki', 'true', 'love', 'last', 'super-wealthy', 'highly', 'intellectual', 'background', 'Usami', 'clashes', 'working', 'class', 'background', 'young', 'student', 'Misaki', 'who', 'blaming', 'loss', 'parents', 'child', 'obsessed', 'not', 'causing', 'trouble', 'others', 'Usami', 'arrogant', 'dysfunctional', 'socially', 'elite', 'family', 'two', 'blend', 'together', 'make', 'couple', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'families', 'put', 'way', 'Full', 'humour', 'drama', 'side-stories', 'anime', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

1404785,A2H7SQIYMJ7RKM,B004F88HZI,"Yamila ""Keyblademaster22""","[4, 5]","All I have to write is that I loved the first season to Junjou Romantica and it's very steamy, touching, a lot of dramatic scenes but nonetheless, it still has a storyline attached to it.  Misaki, who is a struggling college student rooms in with Usagi-san in the first season because Misaki didn't want to cause trouble for his older brother; Takahiro.  Then not to long afterwards in the first season, has Usagi-san literally spill his love for Misaki.  In the second season, Misaki and Usagi-san's relationship gets put to the test again when Usagi-san's older brother Harihiko bumps into Misaki at the train station and from there on, it just gets haywire.  I'm not a squealing fangirl or whatever but this by far is the best yaoi I've watched/read.  Junjou Romantica isn't just famous for hot and steamy scenes, it also is famous for laugh out loud epidsodes between Hiroki/Nawaki; which is in Egoist and Misaki and Usagi-san wich is the first; Romantica.  I'd highly recommend anyone who likes yaoi or your craze-up fangirl to get the series and manga.  It's really good and emotional.",5,Junjou Romantica Season II,1304294400,"05 2, 2011",2011,1091,"['have', 'write', 'loved', 'first', 'season', 'Junjou', 'Romantica', 'very', 'steamy', 'touching', 'lot', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'nonetheless', 'still', 'storyline', 'attached', 'Misaki', 'who', 'struggling', 'college', 'student', 'rooms', 'Usagi-san', 'first', 'season', 'Misaki', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'cause', 'trouble', 'older', 'brother', 'Takahiro', 'Then', 'not', 'long', 'afterwards', 'first', 'season', 'Usagi-san', 'literally', 'love', 'Misaki', 'second', 'season', 'Misaki', 'Usagi-san', 'relationship', 'put', 'test', 'again', 'when', 'Usagi-san', 'older', 'brother', 'Harihiko', 'Misaki', 'train', 'station', 'there', 'just', 'haywire', ""'m"", 'not', 'squealing', 'fangirl', 'far', 'best', 'yaoi', ""'ve"", 'watched/read', 'Junjou', 'Romantica', ""n't"", 'just', 'famous', 'hot', 'steamy', 'scenes', 'also', 'famous', 'laugh', 'loud', 'epidsodes', 'Hiroki/Nawaki', 'Egoist', 'Misaki', 'Usagi-san', 'wich', 'first', 'Romantica', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'yaoi', 'craze-up', 'fangirl', 'get', 'series', 'manga', 'really', 'good', 'emotional']",N/A
