For those of you unfamiliar with the first in this two part film series, I really reccomend that you watch LA GLOIRE DE MON PERE (MY FATHER'S GLORY) before seeing LE CHATEAU DE MA MERE (MY MOTHER'S CASTLE).  This second part is based on the teen years of writer Marcel Pagnol and some of the most profound memories he had from that time of his life.  It follows him, his family and the people who cross his path along the way.  We see the triumphs and the tragedies and all incidents are depicted with grace and beauty (even when they are the most painful to watch).  Everything from the separation that occurs between parent and child to childhood crushes are shown in a very natural and believable way.  What's more, the cinematography just makes the scenes soar.

However, every time they leave Marcel wishes to go back to the hills and he is always daydreaming of the hills.  As he daydreams he is picked to take the scholarship application test offered once a year by his school and this conflicts with his desires.  The teachers in his school, including his father, keep their eyes on Marcel and quiz him constantly.  However, due to the deteriorating health of his mother, his family must return to the hills frequently.  This means that they will have to walk six miles every time they want to go to their cottage.  One day on their way to the cottage, they meet an old student of Marcel's father.  The ex-student offers to take them on a shortcut and later offers them a key that takes them through the shortcut, but this is somewhat illegal and it is against his fathers principles.  After some consideration the father accepts and the dream of coming to the hills more often seems to be more solid.

Muller ""Louis Muller""","[3, 3]","Amongst all the ""bleak"","" hard-hitting"", ""unflinchingly honest""  ""unrelenting realism"" with which we are confronted in the name of so much art-house cinema, this film (together with its predecessor My Father's Glory) offers something precious, something we lose in transit to adulthood. For in each one of us the secret garden, the summer holiday, the opening of presents, the kitchen of warm community  longs to be found again. Its there, but we in jaded sophistication and disillusion have lost the key.Having a key to a door along the canal which would afford their luggage-laden family an illicit short-cut en-route to their holiday house, and all the attendant moral dilemmas for a strict middle-class family is the ostensible subject-matter of the film. Not much, a trivial bourgeois episode, rendered for maximum sentimental effect says the cynic inside. Yes. Until your eyes involuntary begin to follow the limpid flow of water in the canal, until the landscape of Provence takes you in, and you find yourself a guest at their table in a lavender dusk. With the whole expanse of childhood waiting to be explored in the morning.At the end of the film the cold, real world is acknowledged, but reluctantly, hurriedly like an unpleasant aftertaste. Time passes and death closes in on us all, encloses us from all. But in an act of defiance the adult Marcel literally breaks down the door central to the film, the source of anguish. Love, it is hinted, will prevail, and restore.See this film to be made young again.

716567,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B00006I04K,The Guardian,"[4, 4]","""Le Chateau de ma Mere"" (My Mother's Castle) continues the autobiographical story of Marcel Pagnol's near-idyllic childhood in Provence in the optimistic years immediately before the First World War. It's a chronological sequel to the first instalment ""La Gloire de mon Pere"" (The Glory of my Father), and although ""Chateau"" stands as a fine piece of cinema in its own right, it's best seen after you have viewed the first film. Both films are superbly directed by Yves Robert.In this second film, the family arrange to spend every weekend in their idyllic holiday home, returning to Marseilles every Monday evening as Augustine (Marcel's clever and enigmatic mother) manages to fix it through an influential contact for her husband to start his teaching work on Tuesdays instead of Mondays.At the insistence of an appreciative former student of Marcel's Papa who now has a job as a minor official on the canal, the family are given a key to all the doors along the canal path and so shorten their four-hour walk from the end of the tram line to the country home by half. This is borderline illegal, as the path technically leads through the grounds of various chateaux and so trespasses on private property- a major sub-plot leading to new friendships, much principled and moralistic soul-searching and one bitter encounter which serves to illustrate differing attitudes of generosity and malevolence found in human nature (needless to say, the author of their misfortune eventually gets his come-uppance in a humorous and satisfying denouement).The rites-of-passage element of the story includes Marcel's obsession with a pretentious and eccentric girl (and her even more pretentious and eccentric parents), which for a time estranges him from his younger brother and his friend-from-the-wilds Lilli - until he sees the error of his ways and returns to the more wholesome values of his own family.These films are beautiful, rich and life-affirming, spiced with humour. The stunningly beautiful landscape, the intelligent script, the meandering plot-line, the finely observed period details recalling that long-lost age of innocence, the quirks and eccentricities of the main characters (particularly the male adult leads) make for a first-class cinematic experience which lingers long in the memory. Beware you will need a strong emotional constitution watching the final scene. Voiced-over by the now-adult Marcel, it is so heartbreakingly poignant as it reflects on the fleeting nature of human life and the passage of time that it brought tears to the eyes of some in my family - no mean achievement, I can tell you.

Like its predecessor, it is a movie that really does not have a plot, but it has well developed characters, a beautiful setting, and wonderful music. In this film, the family visits a beloved vacation home in the South of France as often as possible. The mother Augustine is more the focus of this film, but Marcel's father also plays a significant role. We get a sense of how powerful his father's teaching impacted students when we meet one of his former students who is now an adult. In this film we see Marcel grow up a bit more. He still has a great friend in the country boy Lilli, a friendship which began in the first film. He also has his first crush on a rather eccentric girl. Perhaps the greatest moment in the film is when the family learns that Marcel will be able to attend a prestigious exam school. Marcel realizes that this will give him greater educational opportunities than his father ever had, but he also realizes that he may never be the wonderful person that his father happened to be.I viewed this film prior to viewing My Father's Glory. This is not to say that My Mother's Castle is not a good enough film to stand on its own. The two films are nearly equal in all aspects.
