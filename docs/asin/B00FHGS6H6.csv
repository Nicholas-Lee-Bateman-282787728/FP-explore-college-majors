Pavlick,"[0, 0]","This Christmas performance is a sensory explosion of wonderful sights and sounds that will take you to another time and place.The quality of the performance is right up there with other greats like Kings College Choir. The chorister's voices are angelic, to say the least. But what is more, the close-ups of the choristers show a child-like innocence and purity that I haven't seen anywhere in years and years. You see beautiful young people who actually open their mouths and enunciate and smile and look like they mean what they are singing; it's remarkable !The children their age that I see in my neighborhood are just all small adults full of anger and cynicism and incapable of joy or happiness. But these young choristers simply radiated joy and peace; happiness and innocence. As I watched them and listened to them, I somehow felt that maybe there is hope for the world after all.",5,Angels I Have Heard On High,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,889,"['Christmas', 'performance', 'sensory', 'explosion', 'wonderful', 'sights', 'will', 'take', 'time', 'place.The', 'quality', 'performance', 'right', 'there', 'other', 'greats', 'Kings', 'College', 'Choir', 'chorister', 'voices', 'are', 'angelic', 'say', 'least', 'what', 'more', 'close-ups', 'choristers', 'show', 'child-like', 'innocence', 'purity', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anywhere', 'years', 'years', 'see', 'beautiful', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'open', 'mouths', 'enunciate', 'smile', 'look', 'mean', 'what', 'are', 'singing', 'remarkable', 'children', 'age', 'see', 'neighborhood', 'are', 'just', 'small', 'adults', 'full', 'anger', 'cynicism', 'incapable', 'joy', 'happiness', 'young', 'choristers', 'simply', 'radiated', 'joy', 'peace', 'happiness', 'innocence', 'watched', 'listened', 'somehow', 'felt', 'maybe', 'hope', 'world']",Angels Sing: Christmas in Ireland
