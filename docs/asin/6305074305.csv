The definition of a great bad movie is that it not only has to be horribly acted with terrible effects, it actually has to be enjoyable, otherwise it's just garbage. This film is thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. Yes, you'll laugh your head off the entire time but that's not to say the premise isn't downright creepy, and I think that's why I like it so much.I did wish the DVD had more since it's a 20th anniversary edition.

The loving, caring, insufferably annoying Waites family packs up the Winnebago and heads for the town of Nilbog (get it?). Joshua, the son that begs to be strangled in every scene he's in, is obsessed w/ his dead grandpa. The Waites' have switched lives (?!) w/ a family of rural folk, only to find terror and disaster in their new farming existence! Now, to call T2 a ""bad"" film is like calling Ebola a ""nasty"" virus. First, the ""plot"" and dialogue are almost completely nonsensical, rarely coming up for a breath of logic or sanity. The human characters are abhorrent, making us pray for the hideous deaths of all concerned, while the ""trolls"" are a true work of idiot magnificence! Every scene is packed w/ an astonishing amount of pure, dripping Limburger, and enough lines of imbecilic dialogue for a thousand lesser films! Behold, the gigantic floating head of Grandpa Seth! Wonder, at the four teen-dorks and their pointless, albeit hilarious inclusion in the story! Nothing can possibly prepare you for Sheriff Freek, or any of the other denizens of Nilbog!

446154,ABARNA66MT43U,6305074305,Bonemonkey,"[0, 0]","Entertainment wise Troll 2 is the best film ever made and it will have you laughing your socks off. It has a plot that doesn't make sense and the worst display of acting ever and I do mean EVER!!! It has nothing whatsoever to do with &#34;Trolls&#34;. It is infact about Goblins. The write up on the back of the dvd was clearly written by someone very drunk who has never seen the film. It goes -&#34;Joshua's fears are well founded for the Trolls, which are a particularly dangerous breed live in the woods around the village. The Trolls in the form of peasents offer the Waits family food, but Joshua is suspicious of their gifts and tries to persuade his family to refuse the food, which is a special concoction which will render them edible for the Trolls.... for the Trolls are vegetarians...And the food would turn the Waits into vegetables!!&#34;The film kicks off with a &#34;boy&#34; (who is actually about 30) in the woods running away from the Trolls (Goblins) who are only 4 feet tall and not very fast runners. But he pretends to fall over and then eats green porridge while gazing into the eyes of a girl with chicken pox, then she turns into a Troll (Goblin) and he turns into green porridge then the Trolls (Goblins) pretend to eat him!Each and every member of the cast gives what can only be generously described as &#34;the worst performance imaginable&#34;.The son spends most of his time hallucinating and talking to his dead grandad. He urinates on his families lunch, then his dad challenges him to a starvation contest. Acting level: extremely bad, annoying (in any other film it would be the worst)The daughter is unbalanced to say the least. When shes not pumping iron or practicing horrible 80s dancing she is randomly beating up her boyfriend because he has friends. In an early scene with the boyfriend (you will know the one, in the bedroom) her performance is so utterly awful she should win some kind of award. Acting level: atrocious, wooden, ropey (one of the worst)The boyfriend doesnt do much better. After being kneed in the nuts by the daughter for no reason other than having friends he is then quite happy to bring the friends along even though this will mean another beating. Acting level: crap, shoddy, cringeworthy (right up there with the worst -this also applies to his friends)The mothers favorite activity is forcing her son to sing &#34;row your boat&#34; so that she can join in at the wrong moment messing up a song that most 3 year olds have perfected. In some scenes she pretends to actually be 3 years old like when she asks her husband &#34;who are the goblins?&#34; (while trying (and failing) to look scared) and he just lazily repeats &#34;the goblins?&#34; then the scene just ends with it hanging in the air. Acting level: terrible in the extreme, nightmarish (easily one of the very worst)The father doesnt seem to know or care about anything going on in the film. He really couldn't have put in less effort if he tried. He enjoys lazing around in his pyjamas and his favorite hobby is naming the various appliances in his house like fridge, toaster, George Foreman health grill etc.. Acting level: abysmal, cheesy, pitiful (quite at home with the very worst)The grandad is the creepiest man alive. He must have abused the mother when she was 3 years old because she seems quite happy that hes dead. He also seems to be a part time Wizard as he is able to freeze time (only for 30 seconds) and magic up riot weapons (like petrol bombs). His favorite exercise is opening his eyes very wide when looking at someone. Acting level: horrific, weird, corny (happy to hang out with the very worstThe witch gives a mindblowing performance (not in a good way). Her bizarre display of over acting is worse than the worst nightmare imaginable. She has the power to replace her hacked off hand just by screaming over-dramatically, and appear on her own tv show where her acting is even worse (if thats possible). Her favorite trick is to turn a corn on the cob into a mountain of pop corn just by putting it in a nerds mouth and kissing it. She can also turn someone into a plant by getting him to stand in a flower pot and hold 2 pot plants with a piece of wood stuck to his face. Acting level: diabolical, demented, strange on a terrifying level (the very worst imaginable)The Trolls (Goblins) are living the American dream. When they arent busy holding meetings (where their leader lists various meat based food like sausages & pork pies and the rest of the Trolls (Goblins) get to murmur &#34;urgh&#34; or &#34;yuk&#34;) they are thinking up ways to trick the family into eating some green food. Generally the end result is a bowl of green jelly, or a green cake with &#34;eat up&#34; or &#34;tuck in&#34; written on it. The Troll (Goblin) extras were probably the first people that agreed to do it (and not ask too many questions) because mostly they just stand around looking confused. Combined acting level: disasterous, shockingly poor, the opposite of what was required (fits in perfectly with the rest)To sum up. Troll2 must be the best/worst horror film ever made. I cannot believe that theres a more extreme one out there. You can endlessly laugh at the plot, the effects, the characters, the script, the acting etc.. you can watch it from any point and turn it off at any point and still enjoy it. Its a true classic. Anyone into Horror/ comedy/ Trolls (Goblins) should have this in their collection!",5,Worst acting ever...,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,5460,"['Entertainment', 'wise', 'Troll', '2', 'best', 'film',

This film is all B-movie all the way, and it's cheesy and fun enough to keep you entertained.  I ordered this after watching the documentary BEST WORST MOVIE about the making of this film and the cult status it has achieved (someone in the film referred to it as &#34;the Facebook generation's ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW&#34;), and the lives of the people who starred in it.  This documentary was quite good and is worth a watch!The movie features cardboard performances that are pretty funny to watch, some little people in ill-fitting rubber and burlap costumes (who are referred to as goblins, not trolls - in fact, TROLL 2 doesn't feature any trolls and has nothing to do with the original TROLL film), and a premise that is ridiculous and not entirely coherent.  That having been said, it also has a certain 80s horror movie sensibility to it that will make you giggle and remember your childhood days looking for scary treats in your local video stores (which are now all but extinct); this film has a cheese factor that I would compare to CHEERLEADER CAMP.I recommend watching the documentary first, and then giving this movie a try.

446156,A16C9QBZHS9UDO,6305074305,Curst Saden,"[1, 1]","Disclaimer: This movie is regarded as one of the worst movies ever created.So why a five star rating?  The thing is, the creators of this movie set out to make a legitimate horror film.  They failed.  Miserably.  Words cannot describe just how far away from true horror this movie is.  They indadvertedly made a hilarious comedy.If you take this move seriously you'll hate it.  If you just poke fun at the logic of it, you'll die of laughter.  Understand, this is an extremely low-budget film.  Most of the film's budget appears to have been spent on green food coloring.  The goblin masks (no there are no trolls in this film) are so low grade that you could get a scarier mask at a Spirit Halloween Store.  The acting...don't get me started on the acting.  I've acted with people in high school in theater productions who are better than the actors in this film!  And the plot makes no sense...whatsoever...To be fair, I think that the film does have some elements that if developed properly (which of course they aren't) could make a good horror or fantasy film.  This is after all supposed to be a battle of good and evil, humans against ravenous goblins, with magic and ghosts and a young boy struggling to accept the death of his grandfather.  The problem is, these goblins eat human/plant flesh and are scared of straight-up meat and the daughter has a VERY fickle relationship with her boyfriend, who's off galavanting in the woods with his friends as they get picked off one by one by goblins, while the ghost of the deceased grandfather returns to help young Joshua fight off the goblins with a molotof cocktail and a bologna sandwich!Confused?  Just watch the film and it'll make even less sense but you won't care because you'll be gasping for air out of laughter.Criticisms aside, this makes for a very entertaining film.

446160,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,6305074305,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[2, 2]","""Troll 2"" should have been doomed to obscurity, much like the first unrelated-but-actually-fits-the-title movie.  But because of that one short scene with the nerd, his three lines of corny dialogue and a fly on his head, the movie had its internet 15 minutes of fame.  There waseven a documentaryabout its cult acclimation, and I would certain give my time and day to view that film.  The most interesting aspect the whole nerd character, who's name is Arnold BTW, is the fact he's only a bit character (but don't worry, he has plenty of corny moments besides that iconic scene).The real stars of the film are Joshua and his family. To be frank, I hated that little brat, Joshua. He whines all the time, and always has that whiny expression, even when nothing horrible was going on; imagine all of his lines being read in Eric Cartman's ""But Mmmmaaah!"" vernacular and you'll understand how annoying he is. Conversely, his bodybuilding sister always smiles even when she's suppose to be angry, which is weirdly amusing when she's fights against her boyfriend.  Her boyfriend, by the way, was just there; doesn't play the hero when trouble's afoot, he's just excess baggage. The mother has the creepiest dead eyes since Mia Kirshner, and her line delivery's just as dead. The father...well, he's a pansy.  Finally, there's Grandpa, who was dead but became a spirit who can only talk with Joshua about great danger as his family goes on a vacation to Nilbog (clever).Grandpa's entire existence pretty much destroys the whole plot. Initially, it's established he could only communicate to Joshua to warn him about danger, and what the kid should do to prevent it.  But at one point, Ghost Grandpa accidentally communicated with Joshua's sister, which showed that he can speak to just about anyone. So why couldn't he just pop up and warn his entire family not to go to Nilbog?  His shocking appearance would have even the most scornful of his kins to believe him.  He could show proof of his trust by showing his ability to FREEZE TIME as a convenience.  Why bother having the kid take on such a heavy duty?  Josh's actions are usually done in stupid ways: for example, when Grandpa froze his family from eating the tainted foods so Joshy can have the time to find a solution, instead of taking the food from them and throwing them in the trash, he urinates the food.  Not a bright move, kid.  If Grandpa would had warned his family directly in the first place, they wouldn't go on that trip and one of them wouldn't turn into vegetable munchies in the end.And now for the bad guys.  The family is dealing with little people wearing rubbing masks and potato sacks (pretending to be goblins), and the main villain is a plant witch named Creedence, who's even hammier than Poison Ivy from ""Batman & Robin"".  And let's not forget the fact that they can be defeated by eating a ham sandwich.  Gee, aren't they a scary bunch.The story really got stupider and sloppier as it went on, right when the family went into Nilbog and met the civvies of the town who plan to eat them in veggie form.  When Joshua went in a hidden meeting (out of the blue) and spotted the human-disguised goblins, he left his skateboard JUST near an open ramp in the attic so it can slide down and the noise would discover him. It had an arbitrary scene when Creedence donned a cheap Elvira outfit and seduced one of the boyfriend's best friends (they were also in Nilbog) with an ear of corn. She didn't really kill him, just covered him in popcorn, and she just left him to be written out of the film; not even the family acknowledged him when they escaped.  That poor excuse for softcore porn was a completely pointless moment, even with Creedence's nice figure.  Goblins surrounding the family but just stood there as they walk away, the family running into the house but not into the car to drive away from the monsters, there's more of those dumb moments to throw around.No doubt ""Troll 2"" is a terrible movie, but I thought it's terrible in a gleeful way.  Not terriblein a boring way, or terriblein an agonizing way, but it's the kind of terrible that caters to those who like to see the foundations of filmmaking destroyed like watching a condemned building explode.  Terrible acting, lazy writing, cheap special effects, lousy music straight out of an SEGA CD game, amateur cinematography, all disastrous accounts equal into one somewhat enjoyable package.  Whether you like to pay for the film or see it legally for free with multiple ads, it deserves to be seen at least once.",3,Welcome to Nilbog (where vegans strike fear in all),1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,4554,"['Troll', '2', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'doomed', 'obscurity', 'much', 'first', 'unrelated-but-actually-fits-the-title', 'movie', 'one', 'short', 'scene', 'nerd', 'three', 'lines', 'corny', 'dialogue', 'fly', 'head', 'movie', 'had', 'internet', '15', 'minutes', 'fame', 'documentaryabout', 'cult', 'acclimation', 'would', 'certain', 'give', 'time', 'day', 'view', 'film', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'whole', 'nerd', 'character', 'who', 'name', 'Arnold', 'BTW', 'fact', 'only', 'bit', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'plenty', 'corny', 'moments', 'iconic', 'scene', '.The', 'real', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'Joshua', 'family', 'be', 'frank', 'hated', 'little', 'brat', 'Joshua', 'time', 'always', 'whiny', 'expression', 'even', 'when', 'nothing', 'horrible', 'was', 'going', 'imagine', 'lines', 'being', 'read', 'Eric', 'Cartman', 'Mmmmaaah', 'vernacular', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'how', 'annoying', 'Conversely', 'bodybuilding', 'sister', 'always', 'even', 'when', 'suppose', 'be', 'angry', 'weirdly', 'amusing', 'when', 'fights', 'boyfriend', 'boyfriend', 'way', 'was', 'just', 'there', ""n't"", 'play', 'hero', 'when', 'trouble', 'afoot', 'just', 'excess', 'baggage', 'mother', 'creepiest', 'dead', 'eyes', 'Mia', 'Kirshner', 'line', 'delivery', 'just', 'dead', 'father', 'well', 'pansy', 'Finally', 'Grandpa', 'who', 'was', 'dead', 'became', 'spirit', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'talk', 'Joshua', 'great', 'danger', 'family', 'vacation', 'Nilbog', 'clever', '.Grandpa', 'entire', 'existence', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'plot', 'Initially', 'established', 'could', 'only', 'communicate', 'Joshua', 'warn', 'about', 'danger', 'what', 'kid', 'should', 'do', 'prevent', 'one', 'point', 'Ghost', 'Grandpa', 'accidentally', 'communicated', 'Joshua', 'sister', 'showed', 'can', 'speak', 'just', 'anyone', 'So', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'pop', 'up', 'warn', 'entire', 'family', 'not', 'go', 'Nilbog', 'shocking', 'appearance', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'most', 'scornful', 'kins', 'believe', 'could', 'show', 'proof', 'trust', 'showing', 'ability', 'FREEZE', 'TIME', 'convenience', 'Why', 'bother', 'having', 'kid', 'take', 'heavy', 'duty', 'Josh', 'actions', 'are', 'usually', 'done', 'stupid', 'ways', 'example', 'when', 'Grandpa', 'froze', 'family', 'eating', 'tainted', 'foods', 'so', 'Joshy', 'can', 'have', 'time', 'find', 'solution', 'instead', 'taking', 'food', 'throwing', 'trash', 'food', 'Not', 'bright', 'move', 'kid', 'Grandpa', 'would', 'had', 'warned', 'family', 'directly', 'first', 'place', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'trip', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'turn', 'vegetable', 'munchies', 'end.And', 'now', 'bad', 'guys', 'family', 'dealing', 'little', 'people', 'wearing', 'rubbing', 'masks', 'potato', 'sacks', 'pretending', 'be', 'goblins', 'main', 'villain', 'plant', 'witch', 'named', 'Creedence', 'who', 'even', 'hammier', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'fact', 'can', 'be', 'defeated', 'eating', 'ham', 'sandwich', 'Gee', 'are', ""n't"", 'scary', 'bunch.The', 'story', 'really', 'got', 'stupider', 'sloppier', 'went', 'right', 'when', 'family', 'went', 'Nilbog', 'met', 'civvies', 'town', 'who', 'plan', 'eat', 'veggie', 'form', 'When', 'Joshua', 'went', 'hidden', 'meeting', 'blue', 'spotted', 'human-disguised', 'goblins', 'left', 'skateboard', 'JUST', 'open', 'ramp', 'attic', 'can', 'slide', 'down', 'noise', 'would', 'discover', 'had', 'arbitrary', 'scene', 'when', 'Creedence', 'donned', 'cheap', 'Elvira', 'outfit', 'seduced', 'one', 'boyfriend', 'best', 'friends', 'were', 'also', 'Nilbog', 'ear', 'corn', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'kill', 'just', 'covered', 'popcorn', 'just', 'left', 'be', 'written', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'family', 'acknowledged', 'when', 'escaped', 'poor', 'excuse', 'softcore', 'porn', 'was', 'completely', 'pointless', 'moment', 'even', 'Creedence', 'nice', 'figure', 'surrounding', 'family', 'just', 'stood', 'there', 'walk', 'away', 'family', 'running', 'house', 'not', 'car', 'drive', 'away', 'monsters', 'more', 'dumb', 'moments', 'throw', 'around.No', 'doubt', 'Troll', '2', 'terrible', 'movie', 'thought', 'terrible', 'gleeful', 'way', 'Not', 'terriblein', 'boring', 'way', 'terriblein', 'agonizing', 'way', 'kind', 'terrible', 'caters', 'who', 'like', 'see', 'foundations', 'filmmaking', 'destroyed', 'watching', 'condemned', 'building', 'explode', 'Terrible', 'acting', 'lazy', 'writing', 'cheap', 'special', 'effects', 'lousy', 'music', 'straight', 'SEGA', 'CD', 'game', 'amateur', 'cinematography', 'disastrous', 'accounts', 'equal', 'one', 'enjoyable', 'package', 'like', 'pay', 'film', 'see', 'legally', 'free', 'multiple', 'ads', 'be', 'seen', 'least', 'once']",Troll 2 VHS

The family head out to a town called Nilbog where the folks are very weird and all that but something doesn't seem quite right for the town is ran by an evil witch and the folks are goblins in disguise as they trap tourists to turn them into dinner but can Joshua and his grandpa's spirit fight the menace?One of those guilty pleasures you can't help but liked! in 1990 three Italian movie makers were making a low budget horror movie called ""Goblin"" then re-titled to ""Troll 2"" to think it would be a sequel to 1986's Empire Pictures production was filmed in Utah and released on video in late 1991 to major negativity from everyone and the cast members were ashamed they made this movie.

I just can't understand the recent elevation of ""The Room"" to a bad-movie status virtually equal to Troll 2.Troll 2 is the funniest and greatest bad movie ever made. The costumes, performances, script and special effects are consistently hilarious. The Room, on the other hand, has a few things that induce a smile but it is only marginally worse or funnier than a hundred other small budget vanity projects just like it. There are no cheesy costumes or special effects or musical numbers to laugh at. It is really just an empty display of amateurism, more a sad waste of time and money than it is funny.To me, a movie has to have some sort of budget and an attempt at professionalism to be truly, transcendently bad. It has to try and gloriously fail at everything. Vanity projects like The Room fail in a way that is boring because they are too self absorbed; professional or semi-professional projects like Troll 2 or Battlefield Earth or Can't Stop the Music or even Gigli fail in a funny way because they are trying hard to entertain us, they are just too incompetent to do so.Give me the crazy costumes, the outrageous special effects, the nonsensical plots, the big stars making fools of themselves, the mad scientist directors and the failed attempts at humor over the self-glorifying soft-porn antics of the clueless rich-guy Tommy Wiseau types of the world any day.

The models and dolls were interesting and clearly showed some skill.Troll 2 didn't have any of that!The film started out fairly well, but went downhill from the first 10 minutes.A family moves into a farm house, switching with another family from that farm house to live in the city.  The name of the farm town is Nilgob.  ""Nilgob"" is Goblin spelled backwards.  No one in the film figures that one out until well into the film!The acting is very wooden.  The mom and her bug-eyed stare and weird lines is just ridiculous.The guy who plays the grandfather ghost is pretty interesting.  They did not play up much on what he could do with his powers against the forces of evil.The costumes and masks were so fake!  I thought I was looking at a high school Halloween drama rather than a major motion picture.There was the subplot of this guy who preferred to bring his guy friends along rather than love his girlfriend.  He preferred his boys hanging around.  This was pretty crazy.  Why would someone do that?  And then when the boys are being taken over or killed one by one, their friends in the mobile truck are kicking back and watching TV.

Anytime we have the chance to see a new piece of 90's B cinema we jump all over it like an elf fresh out of a life size stocking. Being released in 1990, Troll 2 kicked of the decade in absolute perfect fashion being easily one of the top ten worst films we have ever seen. Now when we say ""worst"" let it be understood that it really means fantastic as far as B horror goes. For any conventional movie watcher this one will fly right over their heads.Troll 2 wastes no time in sucking you in with it's horrid acting and weirdo family as they get ready to take a family vacation. However this families vacation consists of switching homes with people they've never met leaving them stranded in a cult like town. The main actor is a young kid named Joshua that has chats with his dead grandpa who warns him of the trolls that inhabit this place they're going to. Once there everything unravels and the townspeople are exposed as plant eating Trolls that disguise themselves as humans. Yeah it's even worse then it sounds!This movie is hands down one of the greatest B horror you will find out there. It has every single B factor from laughable acting, horrible effects, awful plot, with so much more leaving your jaw lying on the floor in amazement. If you were on something watching this you'd transport yourself to another dimension of B that you may never recover from. It was also nice to show some support to other midget actors out there...which was plentiful here. Just a bunch of little people in potato sacks running around the forest with masks that a 6th grader could have whipped up in between 7-11 trips.

There is only one woman in Nilbog and she undoubtably steals the show. This goblin witch-mother, Credence Lenoir, is so hysterical with all her exaggerated overly OVERLY dramatic headspins and wide-eyes that you'll want to watch the film over and over again just to laugh at her, yet you'll love her at the same time.

446195,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,6305074305,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[2, 2]","Recently, Troll 2 has gained a high level of cult status amongst movie buffs, making it a kind of modern Plan 9 From Outer Space.  Whether it's from the clip on Youtube or not I'm not sure(but I'm sure it's documented now).  It even got mention in a recent issue of Entertainment Weekly!  Hell, it's even now got an ""Anniversary Edition"" DVD!!  The original Sonny Bono classic, Troll, didn't even get this kind of recognition.I saw this movie when I was about 13 or so, and thought it was goofy fun, but pretty much shelved it back in my memory since then.  With the recent interest I watched it again, and it's easy to see why it has the reputation it has.  It's a movie that benefits from all of it's shortcomings, cheapness, and downright silliness.  If this movie had been done ""better"", as in better directing, acting, etc., it wouldn't have the entertainment value it has.  Sometimes doing the a film ""wrong"", so to speak, actually is the right way to go.As you may already know, Troll 2 is about a family that takes a vacation to a small town called Nilbog, and ends up fighting for their lives against the town of goblins who want to turn them into plants and eat them.  You see, goblins are hardcore vegetarians, so hardcore in fact that red meat plays a large part in their downfall.  I won't go into much plot other than that coz many folks have already summed that up rather well(and humorously).But everything you've heard is true.  It's so schlocky and off the wall that it almost defies description.  I'm not even sure that you could say that the acting is bad because it's so over the top, obviously on purpose, that in a way the acting is probably right on the money, if you catch my drift.  Then there's the obvious mystery with the film's title.  Not a sequel and no trolls.  But this is an Italian production, and fans of Italian films know that they are notorious for making ""sequels"" to successful(and even not so successful) films.  Fulci's Zombie was slapped with a ""2"" to pass it off as a sequel to Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and look at how many ""Django"" movies there are, even though there were only officially two of them.  I'm sure in other countries Troll 2 is probably called ""Goblin Town"" or ""Nilbog"" or something to that degree, but in America it's Troll 2, which in itself is odd coz Troll wasn't a supersmash or anything(I like it though).Troll 2 was directed by twelve time oscar winner Claudio Fragasso, who's blessed us with smash hits like Zombie 4(not it's real title either), and the Alice Cooper extravaganza, Monster Dog.  It was produced by Joe D'Amato, a name any fan of Italian horror will be very familiar with.For it's PG-13 rating, this movie has a decent amount of gooeyness.  No real blood or gore, but a lot of oozing green vegetable blood and human/plant hybrids that are kinda disturbing in a way.So for all of it's oddities, Troll 2 certainly does deserve a kind of cult status(though I'm not sure why it took so long), but if you dig deeper into the Italian film archives(or even American for that matter), you'll find that many such oddball gems exist and await to be discovered.",4,The Truth Behind Vegetarianism,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,3136,"['Recently', 'Troll', '2', 'gained', 'high', 'level', 'cult', 'status', 'amongst', 'movie', 'buffs', 'making', 'kind', 'modern', 'Plan', '9', 'From', 'Outer', 'Space', 'clip', 'Youtube', 'not', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'m"", 'sure', 'documented', 'now', 'even', 'got', 'mention', 'recent', 'issue', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'Hell', 'even', 'now', 'got', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'original', 'Sonny', 'Bono', 'classic', 'Troll', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'kind', 'recognition.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'about', '13', 'so', 'thought', 'was', 'goofy', 'fun', 'pretty', 'much', 'shelved', 'back', 'memory', 'then', 'recent', 'interest', 'watched', 'again', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'reputation', 'movie', 'benefits', 'shortcomings', 'cheapness', 'downright', 'silliness', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'better', 'directing', 'acting', 'etc.', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Sometimes', 'doing', 'film', 'wrong', 'so', 'speak', 'actually', 'right', 'way', 'go.As', 'may', 'already', 'know', 'Troll', '2', 'family', 'vacation', 'small', 'town', 'called', 'Nilbog', 'up', 'fighting', 'lives', 'town', 'goblins', 'who', 'want', 'turn', 'plants', 'eat', 'see', 'goblins', 'are', 'hardcore', 'vegetarians', 'so', 'hardcore', 'fact', 'red', 'meat', 'large', 'part', 'downfall', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'much', 'plot', 'other', 'coz', 'many', 'folks', 'have', 'already', 'summed', 'rather', 'well', 'humorously', '.But', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'true', 'so', 'schlocky', 'wall', 'almost', 'description', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'could', 'say', 'acting', 'bad', 'so', 'top', 'obviously', 'purpose', 'way', 'acting', 'probably', 'right', 'money', 'catch', 'drift', 'Then', 'obvious', 'mystery', 'film', 'title', 'Not', 'sequel', 'trolls', 'Italian', 'production', 'fans', 'Italian', 'films', 'know', 'are', 'notorious', 'making', 'sequels', 'successful', 'even', 'not', 'so', 'successful', 'films', 'Fulci', 'Zombie', 'was', 'slapped', '2', 'pass', 'off', 'sequel', 'Romero', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'look', 'how', 'many', 'Django', 'movies', 'are', 'even', 'were', 'only', 'officially', 'two', ""'m"", 'sure', 'other', 'countries', 'Troll', '2', 'probably', 'called', 'Goblin', 'Town', 'Nilbog', 'something', 'degree', 'America', 'Troll', '2', 'odd', 'coz', 'Troll', 'was', ""n't"", 'supersmash', 'anything', 'like', '.Troll', '2', 'was', 'directed', 'twelve', 'time', 'oscar', 'winner', 'Claudio', 'Fragasso', 'who', 'blessed', 'smash', 'hits', 'Zombie', '4', 'not', 'real', 'title', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'extravaganza', 'Monster', 'Dog', 'was', 'produced', 'Joe', ""D'Amato"", 'name', 'fan', 'Italian', 'horror', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'familiar', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'movie', 'decent', 'amount', 'gooeyness', 'real', 'blood', 'gore', 'lot', 'oozing', 'green', 'vegetable', 'blood', 'human/plant', 'hybrids', 'are', 'kinda', 'disturbing', 'way.So', 'oddities', 'Troll', '2', 'certainly', 'deserve', 'kind', 'cult', 'status', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'dig', 'deeper', 'Italian', 'film', 'archives', 'even', 'American', 'matter', ""'ll"", 'find', 'many', 'such', 'oddball', 'gems', 'exist', 'await', 'be', 'discovered']",Troll 2 VHS

However, if you loved Troll, you may be slightly dissapointed with the  change of styles.  It is still good fun, but there is just a bit more  malice and intent in this sequel.  Whereas, the previous was suitable for a  slightly younger audience this one isn't.  It could almost be a Troma movie  with the excessive usage of green gunk.  It is also a bit reminiscent of  Swamp Thing style movies, people turning into plants.

Hemphill,"[3, 3]","For those of you who are new to the Troll 2 experience I highly recommend that you start by watching Best Worst Movie, the documentary made by the now grown up child star of Troll 2. (Available on Netflix) To really appreciate Troll 2 you have to understand that the Italian boneheads who made it thought they were making a decent film when they shot it and, astoundingly, STILL think its a good film! The screen writer was serious, the director was serious, the cinematographer was serious, and the editor was serious. The editor is even laboring under the delusion that the Harry Potter franchise traces its origins back to Troll 2! Even one of the lead actors, the woman who portrays the Mom, thinks that its a fine film and compares it to Casablanca!It is only after you understand that the people who made this train wreck of a film did so as part of an earnest effort to make a good movie that you can really enjoy it in all of its splendid awfulness. And, when you do watch it, do stick with it until the final 20 minutes or so. As bad as the first hour+ is, it isn't until the final reel that this thing really soars into a new realm of almost surreal poopitude. There's a prolonged scene involving an ear of corn that has to be the most delightfully bizarre thing ever captured on film.

From the atrocious script to the awful acting to the random directorial close-ups, Troll 2 fails in every artistic manner possible.  It is not just kinda bad, or bad in parts, or misunderstood; it is literally a 90 minute train wreck that only gets worse and worse as it goes along.  Luckily, that is exactly what makes it a cult classic.  Cram packed with memorably dreadful dialogue and laugh out loud characters, you can't help but enjoy yourself through the whole thing.  Alone or especially with a group of friends, Troll 2 is a hold-your-sides, pee your pants, tears streaming down your face, relentless laugh riot that takes itself just seriously enough that you know it wasn't bad on purpose.  I can honestly say, this is the best worst movie ever.**ABOUT THE BLU RAY**  It annoys me when people say, ""If it's so bad why would you want to see it in 1080p?""  Well, why Wouldn't you?  Poor picture quality does not make a movie bad, it just makes it have poor picture quality.  Fortunately for high def lovers like myself, the blu ray transfer is AWESOME!!  Remarkably vivid and even gorgeous at times during nature scenes, this was an HD release that must have been taken at least somewhat seriously.  Compared to the DVD, it blows it out of the water.  Absolutely stunning.As far as EXTRAS though, there aren't any. The only extra included is the Theatrical Trailer in HD, and it's hardly anything special.  If you are interested in more info about the movie however, there is the great documentaryBest Worst Moviecoming out to DVD in November that focuses on Troll 2's cult following and interviews some of the cast.Overall, I think Troll 2 is a rare gem that shouldn't be missed.  Here's a brief summary:- Yes, it's really that bad - but hilarious because of it- Perfect to watch in groups- No, you don't have to see Troll 1 first.  They just used the Troll name to capitalize on the first film's minor success- Blu Ray transfer is excellent- Includes DVD copy of the film- The only extra is the theatrical trailer- For more info watch the documentaryBest Worst Movie",5,Excellent HD Transfer!

446203,A357H3W52835OK,6305074305,Vampyre Mike,"[2, 2]","I was trying to think of a way to start or even write a mini-review for this film, I'm not quite sure if I can pull it off but here it goes.I had a memory of seeing this movie as a child but had never remembered the name or thought much of it then, but now it has amassed a legion of fans who get together just to have Troll 2 parties, or make costumes replicating the ones from the film. That statement alone should tell you how excellent of a film this is. Excellent meaning so bad that it's good.The director of the film doesn't speak anything but a broken English, his name is Claudio Fragasso. He said (in the best worst movie documentary) that he was able to lead his cast through emotions and hand gestures primarily, and it shows. The acting is wooden and sometimes has dialogue that doesn't make much sense, so much so that it becomes hysterical to watch, and is an adventure and experience most people should have at least once.The story primarily involves the main child (Joshua) speaking to his dead grandfather about goblins who trick people into eating various green foods, which then transform the people into a bunch of green vegetable mush that the goblins then devour. Keep in mind the movie is called Troll 2 but the word troll is never uttered even once during the film, and there are no trolls in the film, just goblins. Also, it's a sequel that has nothing to do with the original Troll film, nor does it have anything at all to do with the third film which is called Troll 3 (also known as Creepers, Contamination .7, Troll III: Contamination Point 7, or The Crawlers)The family in the story ends up house swapping with a country bumpkin-esqe  family from a near by town known as Nilbog. You will experience green food, small people in goblin outfits/masks, horrible lines of dialogue with atrocious delivery, peeing on said green food, corn popping in thin air during a not so steamy make-out scene, and even a man who during a mental institution stay, actually landed a role in this film as the shop keep.This movie has gotten a very big resurgence as of late, my friend even made me a Troll 2 cake for my birthday along with green milk, green plates, and green donuts. It is highly recommended that after seeing this movie you watch The Best Worst Movie Ever Documentary, which explains all the ins and outs of the Troll 2 universe, and where the actors are now. Most of them get a kick out of being in such a horrible movie and don't take themselves too seriously. All the while the director tends to lash out at people making fun of his film, or him believing the actors were making up stories to demean his directing abilities.To explain this movie doesn't do much justice, it just sounds like a terrible film, which it is. But if you can laugh at things and not take it too seriously, it becomes an excellent film for a movie night with friends. Horror movie fans, comedy movie fans, and niche movie fans will all enjoy this gem for what it is. A diamond in the rough.
