It provoked many different emotions in me that few movies have done.  I can't help but feel a strong sense of pride in today's American warriors after watching it.

As with Peter Berg's other films (e.g. The Kingdom) it's easy to lose yourself in the intrigue and action. The fact that it's based on a true story, written by the man who lived it, and (along with some of his Navy SEAL brothers) worked as advisors on set (and even played small bit parts, look closely at the unnamed SEALs in early scenes to see Marcus Luttrell).As with most films, much is omitted from the book. Not a criticism, just a recognition of film's time constraints, but the extra features include some of his early days growing up and SEAL training discussed in the book. Watch the movie first, then the features and the book. The movie feels very fast-paced (gives the appearance that he was rescued much sooner than actually happened) but if you go from from film to book, you'll get more as you go along, and won't notice what's missing.

I am sure they would want the events and their fallen friends to be portrayed as accurate as possible.  The movie is not for the squeamish as it portrays graphic wartime violence.  I think the movie gives the viewer a good idea of what these soldiers endured while being assaulted by a great number of Taliban fighters.  While somewhat aware of the pain and agony they suffered from reading in the news accounts (have not read the book yet), you cannot fully appreciate their sacrifice until you either watch the movie or read the book (I assume).  Not being totally aware of how Marcus Luttrell was ultimately rescued, it provided me an unexpected change of emotion toward the end of the movie which I won't delve into without giving it away.

Lubin ""Andrew""","[9, 13]","The movie &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; is Peter Berg's superbly directed story of 'Operation Redwing,' a Navy Seal mission in Afghanistan gone awry. On 28 June 2005 four members of Seal Team 10 were tasked to kill or capture notorious warlord and Hekmayter associate Ahmad Shah in mountainous Kunar Province. Based on HM-1 Marcus Lutrell's (the mission's lone survivor) New York Times 2007 bestseller, &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; tells the incredible true story of four Navy SEALs on a covert mission that is compromised by their discovery by four Afghan civilians.Faced with a difficult moral decision whether or not to kill the four locals who were sure to reveal their presence to the Taliban, the Seals are cut off from rescue as they are surrounded by a much larger force of combat-experienced Taliban. As together they attempt to fight their way to safety, each Seal is forced to tap unknown reserves of strength and resilience as they fight until the end. Combat is loud, messy, and confusing, so Berg has chosen to focus on the four Americans, and presents their story as straightforwardly as possible.The movie is accurate; the lone survivor, former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell, served as an advisor to Berg and the cast. Technically it's first rate; 'Lone Survivor' has already been nominated for best movie, best action movie, and best actor (Wahlberg).The point of producing 'Lone Survivor' is to give the American public a window to understand the warrior ethos and shared sacrifice. Coming face-to-face with some Afghan goat herders, the Seals made the hard choice to release them unharmed, despite knowing the locals would quickly inform the Taliban of their presence. Having made the difficult but ethical choice not to kill unarmed civilians, the Seals are soon attacked by an overwhelming Taliban force. Facing fearsome odds made worse by the Taliban having the high ground, the surviving Seals were forced to strip the body of each Seal killed for ammunition and weapons.

First of all, the movie deviates from the book--which has its own share of issues as discussed by veterans with more credibility on the event than myself--and tries to make the story into the traditional ""at the last minute the cavalry shows up and saves Luttrell"" which is not what happened. This type of rewriting of the story just makes it a weaker story.It looks like it was made fast and cheap. For example, the director just pulled excerpts of the Discovery channel's 15 year old documentary on SEALs to show BUDs training . You can watch those scenes on YouTube for crying out loud ..On top of that Wahlberg is good at comedic roles but is horribly miscast here. He can't even fake a Texan accent and in the scene where he discusses texas with the Afghani kid he talks about Texas with his ""baw-stone"" accent. Plus he's almost 15 years older now than Luttrell was at the time of the story and is too old to play this character.And why do they have the real Luttrell appearing in shots as a SEAL background extra?And the worse thing is that the endless camera time spent on watching the four SEALs get shot and shot again and break their backs against rocks -- well, it veers into violence porn to say the least. Why not spend more time exploring why these guys made the (unfortunate) decisions that they made? Why not explore why an Afghani man would risk his life to save an American he didn't know? Why not follow Luttrells own struggles with PTSD when he returned home (struggles that have been quite public )?Instead this movie just comes across as a product cranked out as fast as possible by a studio.

1688817,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00HEPE6MM,Chris Kennison,"[8, 14]","I have always been a fan of director Peter Berg. His movies haven&#8217;t always been well reviewed or even movies that I liked, but one thing that Berg always puts first, places him as a rare breed in Hollywood these days; he digs deep into the characters personalities and he lets them tell the story instead of the visuals. &#8220;Lone Survivor&#8221; may just be his shining achievement to date for that very reason.The movie is based on a real Seal Team 10 failed mission called Operation Red Wings in Afghanistan, 2005. In order to tell the story accurately, Berg had the lone survivor, SO1 Marcus Luttrell move into his home for a month, as well as visiting the deceased families in order to truly understand them. It is that devotion to accuracy and responsibility that earns, to me, a massive level of respect for Peter Berg as a director and earns what may be his best movie to date.&#8220;Lone Survivor&#8221; is not only a testament to Berg, it is a testament to the Navy Seal heroes that push their bodies to excruciating places in order to rise above their enemies and their conditions. It is the kind of movie that I have only experience once before with &#8220;Saving Private Ryan&#8221;. When it&#8217;s over you could hear a pin drop in the mostly packed theater. You stick around during the credits out of respect for the men and boys that lost their lives during the operation.The book &#8220;Lone Survivor&#8221; depicts the enlistment and training of Luttrell. That portion of the book is adequately portrayed with real archive training footage, showing how they are pushed to the inch of death to prepare themselves for the worst. This footage is a perfect precursor to what is to come as the four men endure a grueling 4-hour dogfight with an overwhelming number of Taliban fighters in a rugged and mountainous area. The events are captured with stunning realism. Some of which, I&#8217;m not even sure how they pulled off so convincingly.&#8220;Lone Survivor&#8221; is an important movie in all aspects. It isn&#8217;t an anti-war movie or a pro-war movie. It is what it is; reality. It is filmed and told with great accuracy and in doing so, it is treated with the ultimate fairness. Understand why soldiers do what they do, understand the enemy we fight and understand that all Muslims aren't the problem. When it is all said and done, the movie is impossible to take your eyes off. As relentless as the movie is, it is only a movie compared to what the real Seals went through on that mountain.",5,BERG the perfect Director for this type film,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,2522,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'director', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'movies', 'haven', '8217', 'always', 'been', 'well', 'reviewed', 'even', 'movies', 'liked', 'one', 'thing', 'Berg', 'always', 'first', 'rare', 'breed', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'deep', 'characters', 'personalities', 'tell', 'story', 'instead', 'visuals', '8220', 'Lone', 'Survivor', '8221', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'shining', 'achievement', 'date', 'very', 'reason.The', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'Seal', 'Team', '10', 'failed', 'mission', 'called', 'Operation', 'Red', 'Wings', 'Afghanistan', '2005', 'order', 'tell', 'story', 'accurately', 'Berg', 'had', 'lone', 'survivor', 'SO1', 'Marcus', 'Luttrell', 'move', 'home', 'month', 'as', 'well', 'visiting', 'deceased', 'families', 'order', 'truly', 'understand', 'devotion', 'accuracy', 'responsibility', 'massive', 'level', 'respect', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'director', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'date.', '8220', 'Lone', 'Survivor', '8221', 'not', 'only', 'testament', 'Berg', 'testament', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'heroes', 'push', 'bodies', 'excruciating', 'places', 'order', 'rise', 'enemies', 'conditions', 'kind', 'movie', 'have', 'only', 'experience', 'once', '8220', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', '8221', 'When', '8217', 's', 'could', 'hear', 'pin', 'drop', 'mostly', 'packed', 'theater', 'stick', 'around', 'credits', 'respect', 'men', 'boys', 'lost', 'lives', 'operation.The', 'book', '8220', 'Lone', 'Survivor', '8221', 'enlistment', 'training', 'Luttrell', 'portion', 'book', 'adequately', 'portrayed', 'real', 'archive', 'training', 'footage', 'showing', 'how', 'are', 'pushed', 'inch', 'death', 'prepare', 'worst', 'footage', 'perfect', 'precursor', 'what', 'come', 'four', 'men', 'endure', 'grueling', '4-hour', 'dogfight', 'overwhelming', 'number', 'Taliban', 'fighters', 'rugged', 'mountainous', 'area', 'events', 'are', 'captured', 'stunning', 'realism', '8217', 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'how', 'pulled', 'off', 'so', 'convincingly.', '8220', 'Lone', 'Survivor', '8221', 'important', 'movie', 'aspects', '8217', 't', 'anti-war', 'movie', 'pro-war', 'movie', 'what', 'reality', 'filmed', 'told', 'great', 'accuracy', 'doing', 'so', 'treated', 'ultimate', 'fairness', 'Understand', 'why', 'soldiers', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'understand', 'enemy', 'fight', 'understand', 'Muslims', 'are', ""n't"", 'problem', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'movie', 'impossible', 'take', 'eyes', 'off', 'As', 'relentless', 'movie', 'only', 'movie', 'compared', 'what', 'real', 'Seals', 'went', 'mountain']",N/A

1688821,A3PO3YRFX4BI2J,B00HEPE6MM,CMCM,"[9, 13]","This is hands down the most intense, graphic, gripping and riveting war film I have ever seen, bar none.  Start to finish it does not let up, and as a viewer you are carried along on this wild roller coaster ride as you immerse yourself into the real life series of events that this film depicts.  The theater was packed with both men and women, which was interesting to note.What these soldiers went through to succeed in Seal training was astounding (almost beyond what most of us could ever imagine being able to do) and their bond to each other was simply amazing but also the necessity that kept them going.  What happened to these guys physically was beyond incredible (for me the most intense was several instances of having to escape by jumping off literal cliffs and bouncing down long rocky slopes, truly painfully hard to watch, and how on earth did they not end up with their bodies entirely broken in a million pieces?) , yet they kept going despite what seemed like impossible odds for a very long time.  Knowing from the outset that only Luttrell would survive did not detract from the story, but it made things so much more poignant as you watch events unfold as people were lost.I was very glad to see that the evil viciousness and utter cruelty of the Taliban was clearly depticted through not only their treatment of Americans they captured but also their eagerness to mow down their own fellow Afghans who do not agree with them.  I was also glad to see a clear portrayal of good and compassionate Afghan people who made it clear they did not support the Taliban (one man emphatically stating ""Taliban nistam, I am not a Taliban), and who risked their own lives to save Luttrell.  Overall, I did not see this film as a political commentary on the war either pro or con (although there were a few small things that clearly revealed the political frustrations our military has to operate under in trying to do their jobs), but before long I felt this film had boiled down to the Seal team's most basic will to survive under the most seemingly impossible odds in this war, this battle.As a woman, I have to say I strongly responded to this film despite how hard it was to watch and experience, but I'm not sure I could watch it a second time due to its emotional intensity.  It left me with such profound respect and increased admiration for our soliders and for these Seals in particular.  I would put this film into a category of ""everyone needs to see this.""  Most people have no idea what war can really be like at its worst, and why any war entered into must be done with clear purpose and resolve to finish and achieve our goals going into it.  No namby pamby politicians doing the back seat directing of war, please.  All this said, I did leave the film wondering why we keep going into wars (Vietnam going forward) but don't allow ourselves to fully do what it takes to achieve our goals.  Politics always meddles too much, and I feel angry about that.  Do the job right and then go home.Deeply gratifying was a long segment at the end of the film which showed multiple photos and some video clips of all the real Seals who died in this incident, giving them a much needed and well deserved face and honor that should never be forgotten by any of us.  It was important to be able to put a real face to the names in the film.  Real people who led real lives and who died terrible deaths, and who should be honored and remembered.  The emotion of this film will make you cry (or want to), and this was a film in which the appreciative audience clapped somberly but with respect at the end.Finally, kudos are due to Mark Wahlberg, who did such an incredible job both in his portrayal of Luttrell and in his role as producer.  He did great honor to the Seals in his telling of this important story.  I hope he gets the recognition he deserves for this film. All of the actors were absolutely superb.",5,"Intense and Riveting, a Must See for Everyone",1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,3920,"['down', 'most', 'intense', 'graphic', 'gripping', 'riveting', 'war', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'bar', 'none', 'Start', 'finish', 'not', 'let', 'up', 'viewer', 'are', 'carried', 'wild', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'immerse', 'real', 'life', 'series', 'events', 'film', 'theater', 'was', 'packed', 'men', 'women', 'was', 'interesting', 'soldiers', 'went', 'succeed', 'Seal', 'training', 'was', 'astounding', 'almost', 'what', 'most', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'bond', 'other', 'was', 'simply', 'amazing', 'also', 'necessity', 'kept', 'going', 'What', 'happened', 'guys', 'physically', 'was', 'incredible', 'most', 'intense', 'was', 'several', 'instances', 'having', 'escape', 'jumping', 'off', 'literal', 'cliffs', 'bouncing', 'down', 'long', 'rocky', 'slopes', 'truly', 'painfully', 'hard', 'watch', 'how', 'earth', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'bodies', 'entirely', 'broken', 'million', 'pieces', 'yet', 'kept', 'going', 'what', 'seemed', 'like', 'impossible', 'odds', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Knowing', 'outset', 'only', 'Luttrell', 'would', 'survive', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'story', 'made', 'things', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'poignant', 'watch', 'events', 'unfold', 'people', 'were', 'lost.I', 'was', 'very', 'glad', 'see', 'evil', 'viciousness', 'utter', 'cruelty', 'Taliban', 'was', 'clearly', 'depticted', 'not', 'only', 'treatment', 'Americans', 'captured', 'also', 'eagerness', 'mow', 'down', 'own', 'fellow', 'Afghans', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'was', 'also', 'glad', 'see', 'clear', 'portrayal', 'good', 'compassionate', 'Afghan', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'clear', 'did', 'not', 'support', 'Taliban', 'one', 'man', 'emphatically', 'stating', 'Taliban', 'nistam', 'am', 'not', 'Taliban', 'who', 'risked', 'own', 'lives', 'save', 'Luttrell', 'Overall', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'film', 'political', 'commentary', 'war', 'pro', 'con', 'were', 'few', 'small', 'things', 'clearly', 'revealed', 'political', 'frustrations', 'military', 'operate', 'trying', 'do', 'jobs', 'long', 'felt', 'film', 'had', 'boiled', 'down', 'Seal', 'team', 'most', 'basic', 'will', 'survive', 'most', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'odds', 'war', 'woman', 'have', 'say', 'strongly', 'responded', 'film', 'how', 'hard', 'was', 'watch', 'experience', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'could', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'due', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'left', 'such', 'profound', 'respect', 'increased', 'admiration', 'soliders', 'Seals', 'particular', 'would', 'put', 'film', 'category', 'everyone', 'see', 'Most', 'people', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'war', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'worst', 'why', 'war', 'entered', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'clear', 'purpose', 'resolve', 'finish', 'achieve', 'goals', 'going', 'namby', 'pamby', 'politicians', 'doing', 'back', 'seat', 'directing', 'war', 'please', 'said', 'did', 'leave', 'film', 'wondering', 'why', 'keep', 'going', 'wars', 'Vietnam', 'going', 'forward', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'ourselves', 'fully', 'do', 'what', 'achieve', 'goals', 'Politics', 'always', 'meddles', 'too', 'much', 'feel', 'angry', 'Do', 'job', 'right', 'then', 'go', 'home.Deeply', 'gratifying', 'was', 'long', 'segment', 'end', 'film', 'showed', 'multiple', 'photos', 'video', 'clips', 'real', 'Seals', 'who', 'died', 'incident', 'giving', 'much', 'needed', 'well', 'deserved', 'face', 'honor', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'was', 'important', 'be', 'able', 'put', 'real', 'face', 'names', 'film', 'Real', 'people', 'who', 'led', 'real', 'lives', 'who', 'died', 'terrible', 'deaths', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'honored', 'remembered', 'emotion', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'want', 'was', 'film', 'appreciative', 'audience', 'clapped', 'somberly', 'respect', 'end.Finally', 'kudos', 'are', 'due', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'did', 'incredible', 'job', 'portrayal', 'Luttrell', 'role', 'producer', 'did', 'great', 'honor', 'Seals', 'telling', 'important', 'story', 'hope', 'recognition', 'film', 'actors', 'were', 'absolutely', 'superb']",N/A

It depicts US Navy SEALs fighting against Taliban in Afghanistan in 2007. It is based on Marcus Luttrell's book of the same title. There is very little plot. The movie opens with scenes of Navy SEALs undergoing rigorous training. Trainees are shown lying down under oncoming ocean waves, being dunked in water so that they cannot breathe, doing pushups, etc.After this brief segment, the film sets up each SEAL team member. They are shown to be lovable guys who have families back home whom they cherish and who cherish them. One SEAL wants to buy his fianc&eacute;e an Arabian horse. Another is concerned about his wife's redecorating in a color called &#34;honeydew.&#34; Given Marcus Luttrell's fame and the title of the movie, most people will know how this movie ends. That knowledge gives these scenes that much more poignancy, but also a sense of the director manipulating the audience. We know what's coming, and we know why the director included these scenes.The SEALs are assigned to assassinate Taliban commander Ahmad Shah. They are shown with all their gear, penetrating a steep mountain covered with pines and strewn with boulders. They see their target, and are ready to carry out their mission. They are discovered by three Afghan goat herders. They consider killing the goat herders, but Luttrell advises against it. If they kill the goat herders, they will be condemned on CNN as bestial Americans who assassinate Afghan civilians. Immediately after the soldiers release the goat herders, the goat herders inform the Taliban of their location. They Taliban quickly surround, outnumber, and begin firing on the four SEALs.The firefight is depicted in graphic, brutal, realistic images. A SEAL is shown aiming his weapon, firing, and a Taliban's turbaned head explodes into a squirting fountain of red liquid. Bullets penetrate flesh and blood and gore ooze out. This gunfight is lengthy and tense. I have to ask how it will affect viewers. Will viewers want to get a gun and make someone's head explode? Yes, our media is saturated with violence. Is that a good thing? Have we given up even asking this question?The film never addresses the larger questions at play, and by not addressing them, they become all the louder. What are we doing in Afghanistan? How do we win in Afghanistan? Are we wasting the lives of fine, patriotic Americans and other allied men and women in uniform? Not to mention the polio workers, doctors and other aid workers the Taliban murders in Afghanistan?How about the rules of engagement? If we are at war in Afghanistan, then why aren't we acting as if we are at war? Should the goat herders not have been immediately killed, thus possibly saving many soldiers' lives and leading to a successful mission &#8211; the death or capture of Ahmad Shah? If soldiers are forced to conduct a war while wearing kid gloves, how can they be expected to win? What if we had imposed these rules of engagement on our soldiers during WW II? Would they have been able to win that war? Would the swastika not still be flying in Europe as we engaged in endless talks with our &#34;partners for peace&#34;?Again, none of this is discussed in the film, making the discussion all the louder inside the viewer's head. In fact there was some controversy when CNN's Jake Tapper asked Marcus Luttrell about the &#34;Senseless&#34; deaths depicted in the film. Marcus Luttrell asserted that no, the deaths depicted in the film were not senseless. Americans are asking this, though.

1688836,A3V1WX74KDD12I,B00HEPE6MM,Darin H,"[3, 5]","While I get that everyone wants to hail our soldiers, make them look like epic punching bags capable of taking any abuse and smile, and glorify sacrificing your life for any police action the politicians want to do. But this movie really makes our military look like keystone cops. When you push the mute button on the ""Ra Ra, go America!!"" and watch the movie, this is what you see:1) Recon team sent in to gather Intel for pending operation loses all communication. Ok, why isn't that 'mission over, and return to base'? What good is gathering intel if you can't get the intel to anyone. As soon as the communication went down, the mission failed. Time to get out.2) You are a soldier sent to fight an enemy (Taliban) and when you encounter an enemy scout team, you down kill or even capture them. No, no, you release them to run down to a superior enemy force and let them know your position, numbers, etc. Sure, that sounds like a good scout team...give the enemy intel instead of getting some (not to mention putting your team's lives in great danger).3) So, now without communications, with a superior enemy force about to be told your position and numbers, you decide to move to a new location and wait?! What are you waiting for...for them to come attack you? Get the F out of their, the mission is over for crying out loud!4) So, they are found by the enemy force (as if they didn't do everything in their power to make that happen), and they have to move down steep cliffs to retreat. So the movie shows them jumping off cliffs (sometimes head first) like they are jumping into a swimming pool or something. I can't imagine they are that suicidal, but that is what the movie shows. Now I have hunted very steep terrain (with loose rocky ground) and I have slide halfway down the mountain before, hitting big rocks and suck on the way down. At no point did I have to go into a head first tumble down the rock. But not one, but all four ""trained"" soldiers goes tumbling head first down the cliff. And, of course, the Taliban move down the rocks with no  problems right behind them (no jumping, tumbling, or going head first down the cliff).5) When they finally lose their first man, they start talking non-sense about climbing back up the cliff they took a header off of and rescuing him.....as if they didn't just leap off a cliff and tumble down almost killing everyone in desperation. Yea, ok, your now going to climb back up with 200 Taliban shooting at you. This is the best clear thinking under fire our training methods can produce?6) During this whole event, the Apache Helicopters were sent off. Since no other helicopter is allowed to fly, it effectively grounds all reinforcements or any help (if needed) during an activity operation (and pending attack).The soldiers actions, words, decisions, etc in this movie make our military look like complete morons. I may not be a soldier, but I don't think you have to be to see that this movie is a brainless glorification of 'dying like a man'.

1688857,A3NNQL8PGWP33S,B00HEPE6MM,DinaC,"[184, 221]","I was one of the lucky ones that got to see an early preview of this movie.  Thank you Seal of Honor FB page for the link for the tickets.Let me start off by saying I was very familiar with this story before I saw the movie having read Lone Survivor book as well as the book by Sofrep on the rescue of Marcus Luttrell.  I have read all of the books on Murph.  I am so glad this movie was made, so more people can know the sacrifice made by our military and their families.Let me give you a little background on the premiere I was at - it was packed, people were trying to sneak sit in aisles because every seat in the theater was taken.  I was lucky enough to have a group of 7 jack wagons behind me that were very vocal - always a bonus right?  They had a comment about most of the people in the theater and especially the girls.  Trust me by the time the movie started I knew which cup size they preferred as well as brunettes vs blonde.  I was really worried that I was going to end up getting into with them if they were disrespectful in the movie.  Guess what, never an issue.  This movie was so emotionally wrenching that all I heard from them or really anyone in the audience was an occational, oh F*, or sniffling, yes sniffling.  I don't think there was a dry eye in the place. Didn't matter if they were guy's or girls.You read the book, you visualize it, but you don't visualize how steep that freaking hill was, or how bad it was falling down it.  You picture the fire fight, but just can't quite get the overwhelming number they were against.  This movie does a great job bringing it to life.  You can't really picture how bad the wounds were.  I knew it in my head, but seeing it and the fact they keep going is just heart stopping and painful.Accuracy based on book - Mostly.  Rescue of Marcus - a little more Hollywood.  So not perfect, but I think what the movie was going for was getting the emotions right.  The way I feel if is the families left behind are okay with this movie, I am not going to pick at it.  Those are really the only people that have a right to say anything about details.I loved seeing how the guys interacted before they left, they did a good job of showing how tight knit the team was.  It also brought out Matt Axelson and Danny Dietz and showcased them and their bravery.  I think more people know about Murph or Marcus, and now they will know about Axe and Danny too.  Also everyone on the chopper.  The Seals and Night Stalkers.The worst part of this movie is knowing you are not getting the ending you want.  You start hoping for it, you watch the fire fight, you know what is going to happen, and you are still devastated when it does.When we finally left the movie, there were still people just sitting with tears streaming down their face.  So bring Kleenex.  Don't let that deter you from seeing it.  I think this is the best war film ever made, I especially loved the tribute to all that gave their life at the end.  Operation Red Wings is so heartbreaking, I have always said my hero's wear dog tags not jerseys, and I hope more people feel that way after seeing this.Sorry if this is disjointed, it has been a couple weeks and I am still emotional about it.  Maybe dumb, but I get super emotional over our military.  I will be going to see this again when it is released and taking my Godsons to it.  They need to know what sacrifices are made for our freedoms.***Strong Language***Blood Spurts (not worse than a video game)***",5,"Gripping, Heart Wrenching, an Emotional Rollercoaster",1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,3481,"['was', 'one', 'lucky', 'ones', 'got', 'see', 'early', 'preview', 'movie', 'Thank', 'Seal', 'Honor', 'FB', 'page', 'link', 'tickets.Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'was', 'very', 'familiar', 'story', 'saw', 'movie', 'having', 'read', 'Lone', 'Survivor', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'book', 'Sofrep', 'rescue', 'Marcus', 'Luttrell', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'Murph', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'so', 'more', 'people', 'can', 'know', 'sacrifice', 'made', 'military', 'families.Let', 'give', 'little', 'background', 'premiere', 'was', 'was', 'packed', 'people', 'were', 'trying', 'sneak', 'sit', 'aisles', 'seat', 'theater', 'was', 'taken', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'group', '7', 'jack', 'wagons', 'were', 'very', 'vocal', 'always', 'bonus', 'right', 'had', 'comment', 'most', 'people', 'theater', 'especially', 'girls', 'Trust', 'time', 'movie', 'started', 'knew', 'cup', 'size', 'preferred', 'as', 'well', 'brunettes', 'blonde', 'was', 'really', 'worried', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'were', 'disrespectful', 'movie', 'Guess', 'what', 'never', 'issue', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'heard', 'really', 'anyone', 'audience', 'was', 'occational', 'oh', 'F*', 'sniffling', 'yes', 'sniffling', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'dry', 'eye', 'place', 'Did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'were', 'guy', 'girls.You', 'read', 'book', 'visualize', 'do', ""n't"", 'visualize', 'how', 'steep', 'freaking', 'hill', 'was', 'how', 'bad', 'was', 'falling', 'down', 'picture', 'fire', 'fight', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'overwhelming', 'number', 'were', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'picture', 'how', 'bad', 'wounds', 'were', 'knew', 'head', 'seeing', 'fact', 'keep', 'going', 'just', 'heart', 'stopping', 'painful.Accuracy', 'based', 'book', 'Mostly', 'Rescue', 'Marcus', 'little', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'So', 'not', 'perfect', 'think', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'getting', 'emotions', 'right', 'way', 'feel', 'families', 'left', 'behind', 'are', 'okay', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'pick', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'people', 'have', 'right', 'say', 'anything', 'details.I', 'loved', 'seeing', 'how', 'guys', 'interacted', 'left', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'tight', 'knit', 'team', 'was', 'also', 'brought', 'out', 'Matt', 'Axelson', 'Danny', 'Dietz', 'showcased', 'bravery', 'think', 'more', 'people', 'know', 'Murph', 'Marcus', 'now', 'will', 'know', 'Axe', 'Danny', 'too', 'Also', 'everyone', 'chopper', 'Seals', 'Night', 'Stalkers.The', 'worst', 'part', 'movie', 'knowing', 'are', 'not', 'getting', 'ending', 'want', 'start', 'hoping', 'watch', 'fire', 'fight', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'are', 'still', 'devastated', 'when', 'finally', 'left', 'movie', 'were', 'still', 'people', 'just', 'sitting', 'tears', 'streaming', 'down', 'face', 'So', 'bring', 'Kleenex', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'deter', 'seeing', 'think', 'best', 'war', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'especially', 'loved', 'tribute', 'gave', 'life', 'end', 'Operation', 'Red', 'Wings', 'so', 'heartbreaking', 'have', 'always', 'said', 'hero', 'wear', 'dog', 'tags', 'not', 'jerseys', 'hope', 'more', 'people', 'feel', 'way', 'seeing', 'this.Sorry', 'disjointed', 'been', 'couple', 'weeks', 'am', 'still', 'emotional', 'Maybe', 'dumb', 'get', 'super', 'emotional', 'military', 'will', 'be', 'going', 'see', 'again', 'when', 'released', 'taking', 'Godsons', 'need', 'know', 'what', 'sacrifices', 'are', 'made', 'freedoms', '***Strong', 'Language***Blood', 'Spurts', 'not', 'worse', 'video', 'game', '***']",N/A

It shows in no uncertain terms what it's like to train and fight in an outfit like the Navy Seals. Lots of death and violence, but no really blatant gore.LONE SURVIVOR is too grimly realistic to function simply as a cheesy war thriller, which is good. Still, shoot-'em-up scenes in the mountains of Afghanistan very much predominate here. That, of course, was mostly what ORW consisted of, and some will like this quality of the film while others won't. Regardless, LONE SURVIVOR would have been better if there had been more in the way of back-story/flashbacks on local Taliban leader Ahmad Shah's activities, as well as more on the specific politics of the region and the operation.

Peter Berg's direction is both terse and non-partisan, portraying the sheer hell of Americans trying to fight in an alien territory against an elusive opponent.  Led by Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), a small group of troops are left alone to fight for their lives in an atmosphere fraught with danger; this is memorably evoked through fast cuts and the use handheld cameras emphasizing the peril that they are faced with.  The actors are excellent, especially Wahlberg and Taylor Kitsch as his fellow-soldier.  On the other hand LONE SURVIVOR is inscribed within wearyingly familiar binarist terms; the Taleban are represented as both savage and ruthless, as opposed to the more humanist American forces.  The fact that the Americans are invading another territory is conveniently overlooked.  The motive for the mission - to kill a notorious Taleban leader Ahmad Shah - is justifiable, but time and again recent history has demonstrated that the notions of ""terror"" and ""terrorism,"" as interpreted from an American perspective might represent something very different in other contexts.  Nor does the film actively question why the American forces are occupying Afghanistan; what their motives are; and what the final outcome of their campaign might be.  The focus instead is on the bravery of a few individuals rather than looking at the wider political implications of their actions.  Within these limited parameters, director Berg opts for a thick-ear approach, with the script regularly peppered with curses and/or gunshots in familiar war-film mode.",2,Run-of'-the-Mill Depiction of American Combat in Afghanistan,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,1611,"['wish', 'could', 'get', 'enthusiastic', 'LONE', 'SURVIVOR', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'direction', 'terse', 'non-partisan', 'portraying', 'sheer', 'hell', 'Americans', 'trying', 'fight', 'alien', 'territory', 'elusive', 'opponent', 'Led', 'Marcus', 'Luttrell', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'small', 'group', 'troops', 'are', 'left', 'alone', 'fight', 'lives', 'atmosphere', 'fraught', 'danger', 'memorably', 'evoked', 'fast', 'cuts', 'use', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'emphasizing', 'peril', 'are', 'faced', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Wahlberg', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'fellow-soldier', 'other', 'hand', 'LONE', 'SURVIVOR', 'inscribed', 'wearyingly', 'familiar', 'binarist', 'terms', 'Taleban', 'are', 'represented', 'savage', 'ruthless', 'opposed', 'more', 'humanist', 'American', 'forces', 'fact', 'Americans', 'are', 'invading', 'territory', 'conveniently', 'overlooked', 'motive', 'mission', 'kill', 'notorious', 'Taleban', 'leader', 'Ahmad', 'Shah', 'justifiable', 'time', 'again', 'recent', 'history', 'demonstrated', 'notions', 'terror', 'terrorism', 'interpreted', 'American', 'perspective', 'might', 'represent', 'something', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'contexts', 'film', 'actively', 'question', 'why', 'American', 'forces', 'are', 'occupying', 'Afghanistan', 'what', 'motives', 'are', 'what', 'final', 'outcome', 'campaign', 'might', 'be', 'focus', 'instead', 'bravery', 'few', 'individuals', 'rather', 'looking', 'wider', 'political', 'implications', 'actions', 'limited', 'parameters', 'director', 'Berg', 'thick-ear', 'approach', 'script', 'regularly', 'peppered', 'curses', 'and/or', 'gunshots', 'familiar', 'war-film', 'mode']",N/A
1688867,A17D77DFID0GZG,B00HEPE6MM,"dsrussell ""greyhater""","[0, 0]","Wow, a lot of passionate criticism.  There will be negative criticism to any movie, no matter the subject matter.  Yes, this movie is &#34;based&#34; upon real events.  But movies are mainly an entertainment vehicle and not necessarily a documentary.  I can and do watch the Military Channel (now AHCH), History Channel, etc.  That being said, my review is based upon how I liked the movie as a movie and not about some political right or left wing agenda that many seem to want to expound.This movie engrossed me from the beginning, even though the first shot didn't take place until the 55 minute mark.  It is one of the most brutal and visceral films that I've seen in a long while.  Yes, I really liked &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; and loved &#34;Band of Brothers&#34;.  This film concerns itself with one &#34;minor&#34; incident in a vicious war against the Taliban.  A failed mission concerning 4 Navy Seals pitted against the odds due to a controversial decision in a mountainous and unforgiving region of Afghanistan.  It's a movie that is hard to take at times because of the absolute viscous violence depicted visually and with incredible sound.  Pure and utter mayhem, which is what war is.  Those who have been in battle (my brother in Viet Nam, while I had a cushy assignment on an air force base), have experienced what very few us ever will or want.This movie runs just under 2 hours, yet it felt much shorter.  I liked the idea showing real Navy Seals going through some of their rigorous training and personal sacrifice at the beginning of the film.  I also felt very somber emotions rising when seeing the pictures of those brave and dedicated soldiers that had died.  It's not a happy film.  It is what it is.  While not a film for everyone (what movie is?), I rate it a marginal 9 out of 10, or a 5-star rating.

The difference in size matters a great deal when you realize how much harder it is to hide a 6'4&#34; person than someone 10&#34; shorter. It also makes a great deal of difference when someone Luttrell's size has to move, has to fall down, has to shelter behind bushes, trees, etc. The same reason that you don't see 6'4&#34; gymnasts competing in Olympic games........Size and general appearance aside, the film was very well made, stunts were unbelievably tough, for the stunt people as well as the actors themselves, and each actor turned in very credible, respectful performances.

I like the way he handles his subject matters and, though maybe he doesn't dig too deep, he does what he does with a deft hand.Here's the scoop. A four man Navy Seal team is sent to a village in the mountains of Afghanistan to kill or capture heavyweight al Qeada leader Ahmad Shahd. One tiny, unforeseen thing happens that sends the entire operation hurtling into hell.I didn't read the book, which is considered by some to be more than a bit improbable, so I can't answer to the accuracy of it all. But say it was all made up out of whole cloth. It's still a heck of a military action film. You meet the primary players and get their sense of comradery. These are cool guys. They are the elite so they they don't have the strict military appearance. Their hair is long.Many sport beards and they do a lot of hanging out. But the call comes in and they're ready. When the doo-doo hits the fan things get real intense and some of the problems arise by the terrain wrecking havoc with their communications. But they work with what they have and kill a lot of the enemy. The kill ratio is way uneven but here you have some highly trained guys with state of the art bang bang going up against lesser trained guys with lesser quality bang bang so it's not too tough to believe. The final 15 or 20 minutes got too Hollywood for my sensibilities. I mean, the cavalry doesn't always show up in the nick of time. I could have done without that but this is still one wild ride up to that point.I liked Berg's &#34;The Kingdom.&#34; Some complained that this great cultural clash degenerated into an out and out action flick. They wold be right,but that seems to be where Berg is at his best. I'm guessing we'll see a lot more of him in the future.

They set up their OP and verify the presence of the target, but then they are discovered by three goat herders. What happens next is a cascading series of questionable decisions on the part of the military that lead to first a tragic running gun battle between the four SEALS and a band of Taliban, and then to the deaths of the team sent to rescue them. It is after this gun battle that the movie really lost me. Instead of following the true and inspiring story of how the lone survivor, Marcus Luttrell, was rescued and protected by some Pashtun villagers, a quiet, life-affirming, true to life ending, the movie embellishes this part of the story with a rah-rah action movie Hollywood climax, where the outnumbered villagers battle the attaching Taliban, while the grievously injured Luttrell somehow manages to engage in an extended fist fight with a would be assassin.

Mark Wahlberg stars as SO2 (Special Warfare Officer, Second Class) Marcus Luttrell, Taylor Kitsch as Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy, Emile Hirsch as SO2 Danny Dietz, and Ben Foster as SO2 Matthew Axelson.The opening scene of the film gives away quite a bit about who lives and who dies during the mission of SEAL Team 10 in Afghanistan (assuming you don&#8217;t already know from all the news reports).  After brief dialogue from Mark Wahlberg, one by one these characters are introduced, focusing more so on Kitsch&#8217;s Lt. Murphy, who is discussing a wedding present for his wife once he returns home.  He then faces off against his fellow seal in a running contest around the base &#8211; quickly established the &#8220;band of brothers&#8221; mentality on their base.It doesn&#8217;t take long for Eric Bana&#8217;s character, LCDR (Lieutenant commander) Erik S. Kristensen to approach the team about a mission.  The mission is to stakeout a village with the intent to either kill or capture an ally to the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.  The four SEALS safely arrive to their destination and begin their stakeout, but are quickly thrown for a loop when they are discovered by a group of civilian shepherds.  Unwilling to detain them or kill them, the SEALS left them go &#8211; knowing full well they would instantly alert the army in the village.The SEALS move into retreat mode and attempt to get to higher ground in order to call for extract.  However, their communications devices do not cooperate and they are quickly surrounded and pinned down by several armed members of the Taliban.  Without any help in sight and unable to call for help, it&#8217;s up to four SEALS to fight off showers of gunfire and survive their dire conflict.Please keep in mind that because the events of Operation Red Wings were all over the news just a few years ago, it&#8217;s hard to consider anything that happens in this film to be a spoiler.  For those that are unaware, it was a battle that caused the most U.S. casualties since World War II, so anyone thinking this movie is bound for a happy ending is sadly mistaken.  Like the events of September 11, 2001, or the battle of Pearl Harbor, this historical event is difficult to watch at times, knowing full well the tragedy that lies in waiting before all is said and done.  In the event you don&#8217;t recall anything about this mission, feel free to keep it that way until you&#8217;ve seen the movie &#8211; then do your own research if you so desire.On the entertainment side of things, Lone Survivor will keep your heart racing to the part that you might just feel far too uncomfortable to sit still.  Even though the character development is a bit vague and rushed, it&#8217;s not hard to become emotionally attached to these onscreen personalities.  Mark Wahlberg, love him or hate, is the main character &#8211; even though he&#8217;s not the leader.  Still, Wahlberg is at the heart of this team and his character&#8217;s bond with fellow SEAL Murphy &#8211; portrayed by Peter Berg&#8217;s fellow Friday Night Lights alumni, Taylor Kitsch, is a treat to watch.  It&#8217;s a shame there was so much going on that these two didn&#8217;t have more time to fully delve into their characters.  And, after Kitsch has really failed to establish himself as a leading man (see Battleship and John Carter), he really thrives in the supporting role &#8211; not to mention as the ranking officer calling the shots for this squad.Outcome aside, the visuals really sell this film as a borderline jungle warfare type of engagement.  The forested area, along with the rocks and cliffs play a significant role in the film&#8217;s endgame &#8211; in which the Taliban clearly had the advantage, plus the numbers.  In any event, there is plenty of action and suspense to keep this film chugging along for its duration.  At times, the shootout scenes are nearly reminiscent to a video game sequence since the SEALS are easily able to pick-off quite a few bad guys before literally finding themselves between a rock and a hard place.Obviously, in a film like this, there are plenty of spots that needed to be filled with dialogue, and naturally, Peter Berg (who also wrote the screenplay) does an amicable job of adding a few light-hearted moments incorporate some unexpected irony to their predicament.  He chooses to show these men putting up the fight of a lifetime (even sarcastically at times), refusing to submit no matter how dire their situation appears to be, and above all else, properly depicting how they stick together.  It&#8217;s clear these soldiers didn&#8217;t know the meaning of the word quit and that&#8217;s the most admirable aspect of being a hero.  To that end, this film is a sensational success and worthy of praise.Overall, Lone Survivor is a wonderful, realistic tribute to the courageous men that were lost in Operation Red Wings.  While I can appreciate a film of this nature, it doesn&#8217;t make it any easier to watch, especially if you know the outcome.  Like other war films, including Black Hawk Down or Saving Private Ryan, Lone Survivor does an excellent job of staying on point and not losing itself as poor films, like Pearl Harbor, have in the past.  Also, like historical films have the tendency to do, time constrains force the story to wrap-up in a timely manner.  For instance, the shootout in this film reportedly lasted roughly 4 hours, but is quickly accelerated to save time.  Regardless, by the time you reach the climax in this film, your heart will be heavy, you head will be hung, and you&#8217;ll almost wish you didn&#8217;t have to witness what you just saw.  With that being said, this is a hard movie to recommend, not because it&#8217;s not well done, but because it&#8217;s simply difficult to witness.GRADE:  BFNDNreview.com",4,"'Lone Survivor'

Michael P. Murphy, USN SEAL, who gave the last full measure of devotion for his country in Afghanistan in 2005.  The Pond Laboratory at Penn State now has The Navy SEAL Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy Memorial Conference Room.  Lt. Murphy graduated with honors at Penn State with degrees in political science and psychology.The incredible account of Lt. Murphy's heroism along with his fellow SEALS is portrayed magnificently in Lone Survivor per the reports of that battle that I've seen.  The highlight of the day for me at Penn State was being able to talk with Lt.

The casting is excellent, the degree of uncomfortable banter is balanced well with the sheer terror of a covert op in a way that few directors and actors have been able to accomplish. This is a bloody, crude, harsh film to watch but the audience must be ready to accept that this is the way things were and remain in the multiple wars in the Middle East. And for what? The film begs the question. It is a story of survival and profound comradeship and it jolts us in just the right way.The film opens with a training camp for Navy SEALS, a fine way to set the tone for the story. The time is 2005, the place Afghanistan. Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg and his team - Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matt `Axe' Axelson (Ben Foster) set out on a mission to capture or kill notorious Taliban leader Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami After running into mountain herders and capturing them, they were left with no choice but to follow their rules of engagement or be imprisoned. Now Marcus and his team are left to fight for their lives in one of the most valiant efforts of modern warfare. Cut off from back support team (Eric Bana, Alexander Ludwig, Rich Ting, Jerry Ferrara, Scott Elrod, etc) the four struggle to survive against insurmountable odds. But is many ways the acidic cruelty of war is somewhat offset by the compassionate benevolence (Pashtunwali) by a group of Afghans who offer the lone survivor Luttrell succor and safety.

This movie has been criticized for its lack of character development but I disagree with those opinions. This is not a touchy-feely flick in which the director holds your hand while you get to know the players. You know the main characters 10 minutes into the movie and you don&#8217;t need to be told these were good men. It is painful to watch it play out. The entire film focuses on operation Red Wing and the tragic losses suffered as a result of that operation.The movie was filmed in a mountainous portion of New Mexico and the director did an excellent job of making the terrain almost a character itself. The story line is very linear and covers a fairly compact timeline. This movie is a cross between a drama and a documentary. Although the director clearly exercises some license to add a bit of Hollywood to a mostly historical event, the transgressions are minor. Visual clues like the bad guys wearing dark colors and the good guys wearing white are obvious but maybe necessary in a film that moves as quickly as this one.  I don&#8217;t know if the director wanted to show the consequences of bad war time policy but there is one scene that becomes the focal point of the entire movie.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[94, 118]","This grueling R-rated thriller is based on a failed 2005 mission when four SEAL team members were sent to kill or capture a Taliban leader. Director Peter Berg (&#34;Battleship&#34;) takes us into the heart of a pretend Afghanistan (actually a stunningly rugged New Mexico) for a white-knuckle experience with all the adrenalin and gunfire that you could possibly expect in a situation like this. We were physically and mentally exhausted before the final credits began to scroll.If I were to look for a villain, I would point to the communications failures that leaves our quartet stranded in harm's way with no hope of rescue. This movie makes sure we understand what skilled and determined fighters the Taliban has become with their ever more sophisticated weaponry. Our team is painfully aware of the Rules of Engagement, even to their own detriment. This film does NOT trash our military; on the contrary, it shows the superb dedication of our warriors.We see:* Mark Wahlberg (&#34;2 Guns&#34;) is our lone survivor; brace yourself for some bloody self-surgery before any medic is on the scene. (And remember, this is based on a true story!)* Taylor Kitsch (&#34;Friday Night Lights&#34;) makes the tough call that colors the rest of their raid.* Emile Hirsch (&#34;Prince Avalanche&#34;) has a girlfriend who wants an &#34;Arabic&#34; horse. He is told the breed is &#34;Arabian,&#34; but he's not sure.* Ben Foster (&#34;Ain't Them Bodies Saints&#34;) votes to &#34;eliminate&#34; those accidental hostages because the team's goal is to prevent more US fatalities.* Eric Bana (&#34;Closed Circuit&#34;) is the capable and dedicated officer in charge of the attempt. It's clear how wisely he plans the strike and how loyal he is to his troops.* Yousuf Azami (&#34;The Unit&#34;) is Ahmad Shahd, the notorious Taliban leader: Brace yourself for at least one beheading.*  I wish I had the name of that big-eyed little boy in the village: He brings the whole sortie down to a personal level.Expect a lot of profanity (this is a military assault with young men fighting for their lives), confusing action (just like it would be in real life), more blood than I care for (remember the real fellows actually bled real blood!), and the shock when our hero sees Afghani villagers in the fight.Mark Wahlberg went up a couple of notches in my estimation when he did a well-publicized rant about actors who complain of the hardships they suffer when filming a movie like this. He said (and I'm paraphrasing), &#34;They should try it in REAL life with REAL bullets and NO catered lunch!&#34;Stay through those final credits as they pay homage to the actual members of SEAL Team 10, complete with names, ranks, family photos, etc. By then, we know which ones are dead.

Truncale ""warriorwriter""","[7, 11]","I read the book, Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell not once but twice before seeing the movie which just came out today in my area. This incredible film stays pretty much true to what was written in the book about a military mission which involved U.S. Navy SEALs and other members of the service in Afghanistan.  Marcus Luttrell and three other Navy SEALs were on a mission to hunt a Talban leader when things went terribly wrong after releasing three goat herders who walked into their location.In a short while the four SEALs were being hunted by an army of Taliban fighters.  The courage, bravery and loyalty displayed by these four men really tugs at the heart.  In this mission there were many other soldiers and SEALs killed when their helicopter was hit by a missile.  If you have not read the book you might be surprised at the brutality and violence of the scenes.  In this respect it was a very realistic war film.Marcus Luttrell was the only survivor of the four man Navy SEAL team and he dedicates his book and the movie to honor his fellow  brother SEALs who died on that mission.  This is a movie about the brotherhood of warriors who always look out for each other in battle.  Mark Wahlberg does a great job of playing Marcus Luttrell in this movie and the other actors are also wonderful.  Marcus is seen in a short cameo shot scene in the beginning of the film when a group of SEALs are sitting around a table.  If you want to see what true honor and courage looks like in battle, this is a movie you will want to see.Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J.

I did not expect to like this movie at all, particularly because I have been overly critical of Mark Wahlberg's acting, but I have definitely been proven wrong. My thoughts on the movie: Lone Survivor.Lone Survivor starts out by introducing us to US soldiers Marcus, Michael (often referenced as ""Mikey""), Danny, ""Axe"", Shane, and Erik. Erik is the primary leader or rather, facilitator of the operation (based on real life Operation Red Wings), and he instructs the soldiers to go on a mission to track Ahmad Shah who is our main antagonist. And so begins our adventure.There are so many good things to say about Lone Survivor. And you who have read my reviews know I like to start with the acting; so I will say, the acting is great, like SERIOUSLY great. Pain and Gain was definitely not one of Mark Wahlberg's highlight movies, but was highly notable as Marcus in the movie. Ben Foster was on point in his role as Axe, Alexander Ludwig was actually quite the talent for his role as Shane, Emile Hirsch's character Danny was one to remember, and Taylor Kitsch courageously holds his ground extremely well as Michael. Great acting.To close, even though Lone Survivor has 2 nominations, I am not only surprised that this movie(along with the likes of The Butler, The Spectacular Now, Fruitvale Station, etc. etc) were overlooked much to my dismay with the award shows as of recent, I am also pleasantly surprised at how great this movie is. I enjoyed it, the people in the theater(as evidenced by the multiple applauds at the end) enjoyed it and I have a feeling anyone will enjoy this movie.

You really feel for the characters.  The fact that this is based on real events only makes it more powerful.  A team is given a secrete mission in Afghanistan.  One there, things go wrong.  The men are caught all of a sudden and were not expecting such a fight.  The movie is about them trying to survive.There is a lot of action and drama in this movie.  You will more than likely find yourself rooting out loud for the guys the entire time.  They do a good job of not really making any one man stand out.  You see them as a team.  One of the best movies I have seen.  I would recommend it to anyone.Now, if I liked it so much, than why the 3 out of 5?  Well, it is for the fact that it is based on real events.  I mean, this was a great action movie and as a movie I would give it a four out of five.  But, as a sort of documentary, I give it a 2 out of 5.  Thus, I chose a 3 for the entire thing.  The reason is this.  I would much rather have seen something on say, the History channel, about this team than watch a movie that added so much stuff in order for it to be a movie.  I did not feel that way at first.  But, at one point, when one of the men is sitting there, taking his last breaths, I realized something.  How in the hell could they know what happened if this man was alone.  Then, it hit me.  This is a lot of drama added to something that to me, really does not seem to need anything extra.  To hear the 100% true story of these men would be one of the most amazing things I&#8217;ve ever seen.  I don&#8217;t feel it really does them justice to add filler.  Some will think I am crazy for thinking that way.  But, it all comes down to personality I guess.  I am going to get something from, I think 60 Minutes about this.  I am almost sure that will be much more informative.So, in closing, if this were just a movie, I would give it a four.  The fact that this is based on something that actually happened, makes me want to see only what actually happened.

The action is realistic and the plot tells the story well without taking too many liberties just for the sake of the movie.  Like most true story movies there are some inaccuracies but from what I read, the basic premise of the movie is fairly accurate.Although it does take a few minutes to get things going, this movie build intensity throughout and is well done, thoughtful, and a great tribute to the men who lived and died while fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.  Even though you know the true story and how it ends, I was sitting on the edge of my seat wanting to get in the fight myself.  The movie is unabashedly patriotic and deservingly so as these men deserve every honor that we could give them.

Having served as a BUMED officer with  SEALs/NSF, it is hard not to look at this film from a personal perspective. These warriors are truly special people. I found the movie hard to watch without thinking of the young faces of these men, that I have only seen in peaceful situations. My admiration for them, and their passion is boundless.The movie itself may be criticized for diverting from the actual mission, but then again, it is a dramatic portrayal, not a documentary. It is extremely powerful in that regard. The major fault that I found in the movie was the ending, which did not touch on the role of the villagers in saving Marcus. I understand that it would have made the movie another hour longer, so it is forgiven! Other than that, it was a fine and gripping piece. Not a sensational &#34;shoot-em-up&#34; by any means.Of great importance as well is that in the last few generations, hollywood has been filed with trash actors who would never even conceive of serving in uniform. I give great credit to Wahlberg for breaking that mold. Our forces CAN feel good about what they do, and should have the same respect from the industry that we saw in the period from 1940-1970. We don't have anymore John Waynes, or Jimmy Stewarts left in Hollywood. Now we get bedwetters like Matt Damon. Does he really think our troops want to hear him whine?

What makes this movie even more powerful is that it is based upon events that actually happened.This is not a movie for anyone under the age of 17 and may be difficult even for adults to watch, but if you can stomach the violent brutal nature of combat, you will be surprised at the compassion still remaining in people fighting and living in countries in war.And if you get upset about the lack of support provided this SEAL team, don't internalize it or just talk about it, do something.  Write your Senator, Congressman, and President and tell them to either send more troops to Afghanistan, per the original request by the Joint Chiefs, or else get our boys the H*ll out of there.  Their lives are far too valuable to risk by under supporting.I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 only because I find it hard to love a realistic war movie, I can like it, but I'm not sure that I will ever love it.I recommend this movie to anyone above the age of 16 who wants to get a glimpse of what war (combat) is really like and just how great the American soldier is that is fighting it.",4,A Powerful Modern War Movie,1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,1835,"['have', 'served', 'brutal', 'deadly', 'reality', 'combat', 'not', 'typically', 'shown', 'war', 'movies', 'movie', 'pretty', 'close', 'reality', 'mostly', 'accurate', 'lingo', 'equipment', 'operational', 'techniques', 'movie', 'routine', 'mission', 'SEAL', 'team', 'Afghanistan', 'situation', 'far', 'routine', 'great', 'part', 'due', '50', '%', 'reduction', 'force', 'numbers', 'President', 'Obama', 'what', 'was', 'originally', 'requested', 'Joint', 'Chiefs', 'carry', 'out', 'continued', 'operations', 'Afghanistan.As', 'most', 'wars', 'very', 'tough', 'decisions', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'will', 'surprise', 'not', 'only', 'US', 'Military', 'personnel', 'also', 'indigenous', 'people', 'actions', 'provide', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'survival', 'man', 'humanity', 'What', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'based', 'events', 'actually', 'not', 'movie', 'anyone', 'age', '17', 'may', 'be', 'difficult', 'even', 'adults', 'watch', 'can', 'stomach', 'violent', 'brutal', 'nature', 'combat', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'compassion', 'still', 'remaining', 'people', 'fighting', 'living', 'countries', 'war.And', 'get', 'upset', 'lack', 'support', 'provided', 'SEAL', 'team', 'do', ""n't"", 'internalize', 'just', 'talk', 'do', 'something', 'Write', 'Senator', 'Congressman', 'President', 'tell', 'either', 'send', 'more', 'troops', 'Afghanistan', 'original', 'request', 'Joint', 'Chiefs', 'else', 'get', 'boys', 'H*ll', 'there', 'lives', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'valuable', 'risk', 'supporting.I', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'only', 'find', 'hard', 'love', 'realistic', 'war', 'movie', 'can', 'like', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'ever', 'love', 'it.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'age', '16', 'who', 'get', 'glimpse', 'what', 'war', 'combat', 'really', 'like', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'American', 'soldier', 'fighting']",N/A

I really think this movie, as other classics like Saving Private Ryan, should be required viewing for the American public as the viewer can truly get a feel for the cost of freedom.  It is gritty and powerful stuff.Director Peter Berg took great pains to make this film realistic to what the SEALS and special ops forces faced in Afghanistan.  He actually went downrange with a SEAL team to get a better feel for the job that they do, and how they do it.  Further, he took great care to accurately convey the character and personalities of the three SEAL team members that were killed in action on that mountain in Afghanistan.  Marcus Lutrell, the true lone survivor was actively involved in the filming of the movie and actually has a cameo role.Did Berg take liberties with the story?  Yes, he did.  I've read the book and there are some differences between the two.  However, all the essential facts are there and the liberties that Berg took do not, in my view, detract in anyway from the power of the story.

1689051,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00HEPE6MM,M. Oleson,"[12, 18]","Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.Director and co-writer Peter Berg has brought to life the story of a failed Afghanistan mission known as Operation Red Wings conducted by SEAL Team 10.  It was the subject based on a book written by the lone survivor, Marcus Luttrell.  (Note, the title gives away any spoiler conclusions.)  While many threads about the men are touched upon throughout the film, it is mostly an action thriller and it works agonizingly well in that regard.The mission was to drop a squad of 4 men into the rugged mountains of the country in order to locate a notorious Taliban leader.  A helicopter assault would follow.  The squad was led by Lt. Michael Murphy (Berg regular Taylor Kitsch) along with Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matt `Axe' Axelson (Ben Foster), all of whom are nearly unrecognizable behind the dirt, grime and facial hair.While they spotted the location of Shahd (Yousuf Azami), they were also discovered by a herd of goats, tended by an old man, a teenage boy and a kid of about 10.  This key development in the story involves what to do with the 3 locals which if freed would likely jeopardize the mission and perhaps their own lives.  Two of the men wanted to kill them and proceed, one was concerned about military rules and regulations and potential prosecution if they killed the civilians.  Unable to reach headquarters, the decision is made by Murphy to free them, head for higher ground, abort the mission and call for extraction.  Unfortunately, the mountain had other ideas and sure enough the teen headed straight for the Taliban who then went after the Americans.  What follows is a harrowing battle.Well outnumbered, the men are eventually thrown off a cliff by mortar explosion.  In a remarkable scene they fall down the steep mountainside which is filled with small trees and large rocks and boulders.  It would be interesting to see the medical report for the actors and stunt men who executed these falls.  It is gut wrenching to watch.While this is a first rate action film coming in at 2 hours, there is little depth given to the character's themselves other than their skill, toughness and tactical abilities.  The training component of the SEALs in general is provided under the opening credits with actual footage of some of the endurance and psychological methods used by the Navy.  The events surrounding Luttrell's eventual rescue are well done but not much is revealed about his surprising relationship with a new friend.  The film is beautifully shot, with New Mexico standing in for Afghanistan.  I will also commend Berg for bringing in another regular from the ""Friday Night Lights"" TV series.  ""Explosions in the Sky"" provide the haunting guitar based soundtrack.  Keep hankies ready as the film concludes with a photo array of those that died in the mission including those on a transport helicopter attempting a rescue.

Can they make it out alive?I thought this was a solid war/survival movie. It's very realistic, except maybe for the scenes of the SEALs falling down the rocky slopes of the mountain a couple times (how could they even walk after such falls?). The first 45 minutes presents a nice build-up to the action and then it's intense throughout the most of the rest of the movie.The final act shares something that I didn't know about this operation, which involves an Afghan village. I don't want to say anymore because I don't want to spoil it.This is just a straight war flick based on a true story and on that level it works well.

I had to look away on a number of occasions simply because I couldn't bear it at that particular moment. Second, the movie as depicted here takes an artistic license and differs on a number of points from what REALLY took place (for example: Luttrell never went into cardiac arrest; the Taliban never attacked the local village in retribution for helping Luttrell, etc.). Third, I realize that the movie is based on Luttrell's memoir which is titled &#34;Lone Survivor: but why oh why would you title the movie by giving away the final outcome? Fourth, there is an outstanding soundtrack featured in the movie, from the indie-band Explosions In the Sky. I've had the good fortune of seeing these guys on a number of occasions, including at Coachella and Lollapalooza. Check them out live if you get the chance, you will be amazed. Last but certainly not least, in 2013 a documentary called &#34;Murph the Protector&#34; was released (now available here on Amazon), detailing the life of Michael Murphy, one of the 4 Navy SEALS who are the subject of &#34;Lone Survivor&#34;. I happen to think that &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; is a much better tribute to Murph (and all of the other servicemen taking part in Operation Red Wings), but you may want to see for yourself and draw your own conclusion.This movie has now been playing in theaters for a month now, yet when I went to see it last night (a Friday evening), the theater was absolutely PACKED. This movie truly has resonated with audiences in a major way. Not only is the movie itself outstanding, but you add to that the apparent still unmet desire of large segments of the American public to better understand what all took place during the war in Afghanistan (and Iraq) and the true heroism from service men like Luttrell, Murphy and others, and you have a major box office success on your hands, and rightly so.

It also made us realize how fortunate we are to have such a fine military, especially the elite units, such as the Seals. Peter Berg the writer/director was determined to do justice to them, and he has succeeded...this was the finest military film - my opinion - since &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34;, just a couple of clicks better than &#34;Black Hawk Down&#34;. It is based on a failed mission, Operation Red Wings in Afghanistan in 2006, as documented in a book written by the &#34;Lone Survivor&#34;, Marcus Luttrell. Having read the book I can say the plot follows Luttrell's story closely...there are only a couple of significant differences taken for dramatic effect and not worth mentioning. The mission was compromised - and ultimately failed - because the four-man Seal team was discovered by a goatherder and his two sons; and because of the decision - the right decision regardless of consequences - to let them go. Mark Wahlberg, in his best role to date (again my opinion) stars as Marcus Luttrell; and he receives outstanding support from Ben Foster, Taylor Kitsch, and Emile Hirsch, who play the other three Seal team members; and Eric Bana who plays the mission commander.

The story is about Operation Red Wings and takes place during the (still-ongoing) Afghanistan War. Mark Wahlberg plays Marcus Luttrell, a Navy Seal Petty Officer who was the lone survivor of the mission. Early on, the movie establishes the characters and gives the audience a sense of who they are, although it doesn't really delve too much. However, it gives enough of a baseline so that when the fighting ensues you care when they're injured and killed. If there was one area where the movie doesn't quite stand up to scrutiny, it's that they could have had some more character development. Still, that's not quite the reason for this movie. It's mostly about the intense firefight that Luttrell and his three other team members enter into when their op is compromised. And it sure was intense and brutal. It was filmed in a way to maximize the visceral nature of the experience and, while occasionally chaotic, was still comprehensible. There was also a lot of well-done special effects with injuries, kill-shots, etc. Here, the filmmakers did a great job putting you in the moment and making you feel the pain these soldiers went through. Overall, I liked the movie which, while never questioning American involvement in the region, does differentiate between friendly Afghanis and the Taliban. There was a touching moment towards the end between Luttrell and a young Afghani boy that was quite moving. Also, before the end credits they have a slide show of the actual people involved in the operation, which I thought was a fitting tribute to their sacrifice. Is it the greatest war movie ever? No, but it is very effective at what it sets out to do, and I applaud it for that.",4,"My review of ""Lone Survivor""",1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,1829,"['LONE', 'SURVIVOR', 'incredible', 'experience', 'tale', 'bravery', 'camaraderie', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'depictions', 'war', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'story', 'Operation', 'Red', 'Wings', 'place', 'still-ongoing', 'Afghanistan', 'War', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Marcus', 'Luttrell', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'Petty', 'Officer', 'who', 'was', 'lone', 'survivor', 'mission', 'Early', 'movie', 'characters', 'audience', 'sense', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'delve', 'too', 'much', 'However', 'enough', 'baseline', 'so', 'when', 'fighting', 'care', 'when', ""'re"", 'injured', 'killed', 'was', 'one', 'area', 'where', 'movie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'stand', 'up', 'scrutiny', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'Still', 'not', 'quite', 'reason', 'movie', 'mostly', 'intense', 'firefight', 'Luttrell', 'three', 'other', 'team', 'members', 'enter', 'when', 'op', 'compromised', 'sure', 'was', 'intense', 'brutal', 'was', 'filmed', 'way', 'maximize', 'visceral', 'nature', 'experience', 'occasionally', 'chaotic', 'was', 'still', 'comprehensible', 'was', 'also', 'lot', 'well-done', 'special', 'effects', 'injuries', 'kill-shots', 'etc', 'Here', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'putting', 'moment', 'making', 'feel', 'pain', 'soldiers', 'went', 'Overall', 'liked', 'movie', 'never', 'questioning', 'American', 'involvement', 'region', 'differentiate', 'friendly', 'Afghanis', 'Taliban', 'was', 'touching', 'moment', 'end', 'Luttrell', 'young', 'Afghani', 'boy', 'was', 'quite', 'moving', 'Also', 'end', 'have', 'slide', 'show', 'actual', 'people', 'involved', 'operation', 'thought', 'was', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'sacrifice', 'greatest', 'war', 'movie', 'ever', 'No', 'very', 'effective', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'applaud']",N/A

The SEALS difficult decision to release and not kill them.  That act of mercy is rewarded by a relentless firestorm from at least forty Taliban fighters who quickly surround the four.Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) are the brave SEALS.  Ben Foster and Eric Bana also star.  And they do justice to the real men they play - and honor.  Berg's smooth direction captures every horrific moment whether it's a bullet's impact or a treacherous fall.  We always have a sense of where we are and the camera movement is not frantic but wide-eyed - it's shot in the same way we remember frightening real-life moments.  The editing is tight and the performances never seem anything but real.  But in the end, it's the big questions that linger.  This ambiguity gives heft to this fine film and raises it to a level of meaningful contemporary art, especially with the ironic and satisfying ending that bookends the act of mercy the men showed to the goat herders.LONE SURVIVOR ranks with and is superior to ""Platoon,"" ""Battle of Algiers,"" ""Paths of Glory"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" in its visceral and moral intensity.

This one had all the makings for a great contribution to the pantheon of war films, but unfortunately there are some major flaws in this one. First, I thought the casting was excellent, and I found these guys really believable as Frogmen (aka Navy Seals). Obviously it was a bonus watching them work out with their shirts off!  But, the audio on this film is terrible, with half the dialogue (and there is little to begin with) being swallowed by the actors. Turns out it probably didn't matter too much because this film is about one thing: combat. In fact, straightforward fighting (between 4 Seals and dozens of Taliban, then between Afghani villagers and dozens of Taliban) makes up a good 3/4 of the movie. One film critic described this movie as &#34;war porn&#34; and I would say my opinion is not that far off. There is very little character development and the plot is simple (based, as it is, on a true story). If you're looking for more than that, look elsewhere. In some ways I'm not bothered that it is mostly just a very protracted battle scene... the effect is that you really get a visceral sense of the hell these soldiers went through. No doubt Navy Seals are badass! And I am very grateful for them, and for their mental and physical toughness, and for their willingness to go where few others would. Unfortunately, however, the Seals don't come across as very smart in this film (they make a critical tactical error which leads to their ultimate demise). And in fact, the &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; only survives because he is &#34;rescued&#34; by an Afghani villager (what does THAT say about our Navy Seals)? I have not read the book, and probably will now, but I am glad I saw the film.

I had hopes of a military type movie that would deliver the action where it is needed with gun fights, strategy, and awesome machinery (AC-130 and other aerial vehicle use). Then I realized this was based on a true story, so Hollywood effects would be and should be sugar-coated a bit. And what did I get? Above and Beyond expectation.Brief synopsis: A Team of 4 Seal members are sent on a special covert mission to capture or kill an enemy Taliban leader when the operation is compromised. What happens next is a battle for their lives and survival for each brother.First off I want to say ALL the actors delivered! I was lucky enough to catch the movie with pretty good DVD quality (I'm a Blu-Ray man). Wahlberg nailed his role as well as the other actors portraying their characters. Second this movie is gory, dramatic, and you will clench your chest in surprise and amazement at some of the action sequences. The director got it spot on and made sure the viewer would see and understand what these soldiers go through. I always had the respect for SEALS but after watching this movie, I have a deeper bond with that respect. And third, this is NOT a military campaign ad! This kind of job is not cut out for everybody. Instead it made you comprehend the bond these men share and what it means to be a part of an elite team.I gave it a 4.8 because this film touched me on so many emotional levels and when it was over I had a tear in my eye. That other .2 was due to the fact that FINAL gun fight I expected a little more but like I said it was and correctly sugar coated to emphasize the fact that it was Based on True Events.",5,"Gut Wrenching, Heart Stopping, and Emotional on ALL Levels",1388707200,"01 3, 2014",2014,1693,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailers', 'film', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'had', 'hopes', 'military', 'type', 'movie', 'would', 'deliver', 'action', 'where', 'needed', 'gun', 'fights', 'strategy', 'awesome', 'machinery', 'AC-130', 'other', 'aerial', 'vehicle', 'use', 'Then', 'realized', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'so', 'Hollywood', 'effects', 'would', 'be', 'should', 'be', 'sugar-coated', 'bit', 'what', 'did', 'get', 'Above', 'Beyond', 'expectation.Brief', 'synopsis', 'Team', '4', 'Seal', 'members', 'are', 'sent', 'special', 'covert', 'mission', 'capture', 'kill', 'enemy', 'Taliban', 'leader', 'when', 'operation', 'compromised', 'What', 'next', 'battle', 'lives', 'survival', 'brother.First', 'want', 'say', 'actors', 'delivered', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'catch', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'DVD', 'quality', ""'m"", 'Blu-Ray', 'man', 'Wahlberg', 'nailed', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'actors', 'portraying', 'characters', 'Second', 'movie', 'gory', 'dramatic', 'will', 'clench', 'chest', 'surprise', 'amazement', 'action', 'sequences', 'director', 'got', 'spot', 'made', 'sure', 'viewer', 'would', 'see', 'understand', 'what', 'soldiers', 'go', 'always', 'had', 'respect', 'SEALS', 'watching', 'movie', 'have', 'deeper', 'bond', 'respect', 'third', 'NOT', 'military', 'campaign', 'ad', 'kind', 'job', 'not', 'cut', 'out', 'everybody', 'Instead', 'made', 'comprehend', 'bond', 'men', 'share', 'what', 'be', 'part', 'elite', 'team.I', 'gave', '4.8', 'film', 'touched', 'so', 'many', 'emotional', 'levels', 'when', 'was', 'had', 'tear', 'eye', 'other', '.2', 'was', 'due', 'fact', 'FINAL', 'gun', 'fight', 'expected', 'little', 'more', 'said', 'was', 'correctly', 'sugar', 'coated', 'emphasize', 'fact', 'was', 'Based', 'True', 'Events']",N/A

It was made with one idea in mind, showing just how tough Seals are and how brutal combat in Afganistan is.They do not pull punches. This is not your typical movie about American military might where the good guys overcome all odds and send the bad guys running. Make no mistakes, the Seals lose in this story. Many are killed, and worse than that (from the perspective of the Seals) is that the mission didn't get accomplished. This battle was an all out loss by the US. You don't see that in major film much.But that's the reality. In real life even the mighty United States Military and it's Spec Ops don't win every time. Most times, but not all. And when we lose it's brutal. This movie does a great job of showing how dangerous fighting the Taliban is. But it also shows how important it is and why men risk their lives to do it. And finally, it shows just how tough Navy Seals are. A normal person would have died 6 seconds into the initial attack from the wounds these guys suffered. Most of us would have been so crippled by the pain that we would have gone into shock and died almost immediately. But Seals don't feel pain or give up. They just keep pressing on until their bodies physically won't work anymore.It also shows that Seals aren't just dumb thugs with superior fire power and extra guts. They are not battlefield thugs. They are highly dedicated, smart, thinking, planning weapons. They know their enemy because they study their enemy until they know everything about them. They understand the place their emeny has in the larger scheme of the war. They are educated and precise. Not dumb and trigger happy.I spent 6 years in the Marines. I've worked with Seals. This is how these guys really are. They party hard when there's not work to be done.

What this DVD offers is much, much more.  The actors were very impressive and their physical actions really quite remarkable.  There is one scene (long one) in which the four Navy SEALs are running and jumping down the side of a rocky mountain terrain.  They hit, bounced, tumbled and I don't see how they didn't end up in the hospital.

1689169,A2LHMP07OFU6JW,B00HEPE6MM,Texas Reader,"[11, 51]","Lone Survivor is about Operation Red wings.  It was a Navy Seal operation conducted to take out a Taliban commander named Ahmad Shah.  The operation was a complete failure.  It wound of costing the lives of every person involved aside from one person.  His name is Marcus Luttrell.  I guess that makes the title a spoiler.There are spoilers ahead in my review, so don't read further if that bothers you.  I will say that it will probably not affect your viewing experience.From an entertainment standpoint, I think this film delivers.  Unfortunately, if you want something deeper than the average run of the mill military experience, this film falls flat.  Peter Berg could have made this film into something greater, but he made a product which is more about telling a story rather than taking on serious issues and creating debate.The big issue I had is that the film does not take on the fact that America has not learned its lessons when it comes to the country of Afghanistan.  There was an Afghani man, Mohammad Gulab, who put his family's life on the line by saving Marcus from the Taliban.  What thanks does he get from the Americans at the end of the film?  They take Marcus away to their base and abandon the man and his family at the battle zone to defend himself against the Taliban.  The Taliban knew he harbored and aided an American, so his and his loved one's lives were in danger.  The military did not care.I guess history repeats itself.  After the Soviet Union retreated many years earlier, America abandoned its ally and moved on.  A vast uneducated and young population was left alone.  They struggled and fought with each other as the country fell into chaos.Fast forward to Operation Red Wings and the same thing happens again.  A guy who put his life on the line for you is left to fend for himself.  What if the Aghanis heard that story?  I would think it would not win their hearts and minds, but it would lead them to believe that they should support the Taliban.  The US may leave one day, but they will be stuck having to deal with their own people after they depart.  I think that is why it is very hard for the American military to win their trust now.This brings me to my next point.  Mohammad Gulab, follows a tribal code known as pushtunwali.  When he brings Marcus to his village, it is his duty to protect him from his enemies and not let him die at their hands.  I know in the American media it is always shown that Afghan tribalism is a backward way of life, but, maybe, this movie could have changed that one-sided view.For me it shows that tribalism is not all about oppressing women, but it has some positive aspects to it as well.  The fact that someone was willing to put their life on the line for a foreigner serving in an opposing military proves that this code is very strictly followed.  Is honor that strong of a trait in the American way of life?  I think that is a very interesting subject to debate.  At the very least, it proves that life is not as simplistic in Afghanistan as it is made out to be by the media.Finally, Ahmed Shah is called ""a real bad guy"" in the film when he is first introduced in the film.  Is he?  Keep in mind, he is not a member of Al Quaida, the group run by Osama Bin Laden, who attacked us during 9/11.  He is a member of the Taliban, who are mainly members of the Pushtun tribe.  They are the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan.In the film, he is portrayed as a target.  He does not have any pertinent dialogue to the film.  What if, instead of the usual portrayal of a bad guy, they make him more complex?  He could have been portrayed as a guy who is trying to get an occupying army out of his country.  Well, of course no one will ever do that.  That just too hard to accomplish.  Hollywood is about having clear cut good and bad guys.I guess the good thing for me is that the movie has propelled me to order the book authored by Marcus Luttrell.  If it's one thing I've learned about Hollywood, it is the fact that the book is, usually, better and more detailed and complex than the film.",3,Another Simplistic Military FIlm,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,4076,"['Lone', 'Survivor', 'Operation', 'Red', 'wings', 'was', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'operation', 'conducted', 'take', 'out', 'Taliban', 'commander', 'named', 'Ahmad', 'Shah', 'operation', 'was', 'complete', 'failure', 'costing', 'lives', 'person', 'involved', 'aside', 'one', 'person', 'name', 'Marcus', 'Luttrell', 'guess', 'title', 'spoiler.There', 'are', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'review', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'further', 'will', 'say', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'affect', 'viewing', 'entertainment', 'standpoint', 'think', 'film', 'delivers', 'Unfortunately', 'want', 'something', 'deeper', 'average', 'run', 'mill', 'military', 'experience', 'film', 'flat', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'something', 'greater', 'made', 'product', 'more', 'telling', 'story', 'rather', 'taking', 'serious', 'issues', 'creating', 'debate.The', 'big', 'issue', 'had', 'film', 'not', 'take', 'fact', 'America', 'not', 'learned', 'lessons', 'when', 'country', 'Afghanistan', 'was', 'Afghani', 'man', 'Mohammad', 'Gulab', 'who', 'put', 'family', 'life', 'line', 'saving', 'Marcus', 'Taliban', 'What', 'thanks', 'get', 'Americans', 'end', 'film', 'take', 'Marcus', 'away', 'base', 'abandon', 'man', 'family', 'battle', 'zone', 'defend', 'Taliban', 'Taliban', 'knew', 'harbored', 'aided', 'American', 'loved', 'one', 'lives', 'were', 'danger', 'military', 'did', 'not', 'care.I', 'guess', 'history', 'repeats', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'retreated', 'many', 'years', 'earlier', 'America', 'abandoned', 'ally', 'moved', 'vast', 'uneducated', 'young', 'population', 'was', 'left', 'alone', 'struggled', 'fought', 'other', 'country', 'fell', 'chaos.Fast', 'forward', 'Operation', 'Red', 'Wings', 'same', 'thing', 'again', 'A', 'guy', 'who', 'put', 'life', 'line', 'left', 'fend', 'What', 'Aghanis', 'heard', 'story', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'not', 'win', 'hearts', 'minds', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'should', 'support', 'Taliban', 'US', 'may', 'leave', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'be', 'stuck', 'having', 'deal', 'own', 'people', 'depart', 'think', 'why', 'very', 'hard', 'American', 'military', 'win', 'trust', 'now.This', 'next', 'point', 'Mohammad', 'Gulab', 'tribal', 'code', 'known', 'pushtunwali', 'When', 'Marcus', 'village', 'duty', 'protect', 'enemies', 'not', 'let', 'die', 'hands', 'know', 'American', 'media', 'always', 'shown', 'Afghan', 'tribalism', 'backward', 'way', 'life', 'maybe', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'changed', 'one-sided', 'tribalism', 'not', 'oppressing', 'women', 'positive', 'aspects', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'someone', 'was', 'willing', 'put', 'life', 'line', 'foreigner', 'serving', 'opposing', 'military', 'proves', 'code', 'very', 'strictly', 'followed', 'honor', 'strong', 'trait', 'American', 'way', 'life', 'think', 'very', 'interesting', 'subject', 'debate', 'very', 'least', 'life', 'not', 'simplistic', 'Afghanistan', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'media.Finally', 'Ahmed', 'Shah', 'called', 'real', 'bad', 'guy', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'introduced', 'film', 'Keep', 'mind', 'not', 'member', 'Al', 'Quaida', 'group', 'run', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'who', 'attacked', '9/11', 'member', 'Taliban', 'who', 'are', 'mainly', 'members', 'Pushtun', 'tribe', 'are', 'largest', 'ethnic', 'group', 'Afghanistan.In', 'film', 'portrayed', 'target', 'not', 'have', 'pertinent', 'dialogue', 'film', 'What', 'instead', 'usual', 'portrayal', 'bad', 'guy', 'make', 'more', 'complex', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'portrayed', 'guy', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'occupying', 'army', 'country', 'Well', 'course', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'do', 'just', 'too', 'hard', 'accomplish', 'Hollywood', 'having', 'clear', 'cut', 'good', 'bad', 'guys.I', 'guess', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'propelled', 'order', 'book', 'authored', 'Marcus', 'Luttrell', 'one', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'Hollywood', 'fact', 'book', 'usually', 'better', 'more', 'detailed', 'complex', 'film']",N/A

The film opens with a montage of Navy Seal training to demonstrate that this is an elite group. It moves quickly to a base in Afghanistan where they demonstrate the adolescent machismo and crudeness that exists within the U.S. military service, highlighted by the &#34;poem&#34; recited by the new guy. We also get to see other aspects of their character, their plans for the future.It isn't long before they go on a recon mission that doesn't go well, and plot spoiler, there is just a Lone Survivor (the guy they paid the most to be in the film). The film highlights the dilemma faced in the field by military personnel in modern times, that is how to deal with civilians of unknown allegiance. If you kill them you wind up on CNN and do 20 years (message: an open liberal media kills soldiers and saves the evil doers) or if you don't kill them, they will eventually kill you. Sometimes there are no right answers except when &#34;The use of deadly force is authorized&#34; as it was in this case. Perhaps they just said that line for effect, I don't know, but to me that would make decision making easy, especially with 20-20 hindsight.The film has plenty of blood squirts. The injured soldiers had cuts and bruises on them which seemed to appear by magic for effect, especially cuts on the top of the face. The end credits show still photos of the actual men involved in this incident with an appropriate soundtrack to make for a teary eyed moment. I think absolute silence at the end while showing the pictures may have been more effective, if not appropriate.I liked the realism of the film, showing the horrors of war and the impossible situations in which we place our troops. Clearly a training course in Farsi (or Dari) would have helped. I will mention the use of predator drones takes those difficult life and death decisions out of the field and places it on &#34;the deciders&#34; who can currently kill innocent people without consequence. This is a good thing for the foot soldiers (or Seals in this case) but speaks volumes of debate about the state of humanity, international law, etc. etc.A war film worthy for patriots.Parental Guide: No sex or nudity.

I was shocked to know that the whole thing happened because of crappy gear. I kept thinking how the team was equipped almost as badly as troops were in the Vietnam War.  Ironically the team was taken down by people with weapons from the 70s and 80s.  It was so upsetting.

1689176,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00HEPE6MM,The People's Critic,"[10, 12]","Capturing the essence of war has been a theatrical tradition ever since the Greeks invented drama.  In the cinematic practice, war films range from fully inspiring to gruesomely tragic.  Lone Survivor is an example of the latter.The film tells the story of an ill-fated Navy SEAL operation named RED WINGS.  During their mission to kill Taliban officer, Ahmad Shah, a SEAL team is stranded in a hostile region of Afghanistan.  What follows is a horrific series of events as the four SEALs attempt to escape a barrage of enemy forces after they are ambushed.The film opens with a montage of intense Navy SEAL training exercise as preparation for what&#8217;s to follow.  Shots of submersion drills, endurance tests, and tactical maneuvers serve two purposes: 1) they make the audience have an initial feeling that nothing can be harder than this, and 2) they serve as a reflective point for when things become exponentially harder than this.  Writer/Director Peter Berg spent four years and a modest $40 million budget to get Marcus Luttrell&#8217;s memoir to the big screen.  The result is operatic realism.  Berg scales down the &#8220;war film&#8221; to create a film that while inherently anti-war is also a celebration of the men who possess an uncommon type of courage.Berg is a filmmaker who has dabbled in this subject matter before with 2007&#8217;s The Kingdom.  In that film, Berg showed war as a fast, swift, pulse pounding, adrenaline pumping game, almost like the football depicted in the television series Friday Night Lights, also created by Berg.  Lone Survivor is an entirely different animal.  Here Berg narrows his scope and slows things down.  This brutal battle along the Afgahni hillside is as harrowing, frightening, and vital as perhaps any of its kind.  Mark Wahlberg, Ben Foster, Emile Hersh, and Taylor Kitsch play the band of stranded soldiers who intermittently attempt to communicate with their commanding officer, played by Eric Bana.  Berg&#8217;s deliberate pace is on full display packed with slow motion evidence of the blood, guts, and horrors of war.What the film has working against it is its outcome, which with the title Lone Survivor, should not surprise anyone.  Thus, it is clear that Berg has more on his agenda than to tell a story.  That agenda is to give tribute to those who fight to keep this country safe while also suggesting what could have been if they didn&#8217;t have to.  This agenda is met, but with a melancholy spirit.  The leanness of the film and the bleak tone make it difficult to watch, yet the film is strong, well acted, and evocative.  The final scenes suggest some of the ironic complexities of modern even with the film&#8217;s simplistic nature.

Some events that happened in the movie did not occur exactly how it did according to the original story.However if you do read the book first, you will get more out of the movie, recognizing characters that are talked about a great deal in the book (ie: Shane Patton). Another great thing from the movie is you do see (and hear, because has has a couple lines) the actual Marcus Luttrell (he's the one that spills coffee and tells Shane to clean it up as his 'first op') plus you will catch glimpses of him later on in the movie as well. At the end of the movie you will see actual photos of the men (and their families) who died during this event.All in all i would recommend this movie, but seriously, read the book first.

Their mission is compromised in an unexpected way, and with radio communication lost, they are under attack by Taliban forces.&#8220;Lone Survivor&#8221; contains visceral and gruesome combat scenes.

1689187,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00HEPE6MM,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0'Long Survivor' is based on the book of the same name, which recounts a small Navy SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance mission to track (and eventually eliminate) Ahmad Shah, a dangerous Taliban commander already responsible for the deaths of a coterie of American soldiers along with Afghan allies. Mark Wahlberg plays Marcus Luttrell, the only survivor of his fellow four man SEAL team who make their way into the mountains of the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan.The film is divided into three main sections. The opening expository section introduces us to the Navy SEALS as they participate in grueling training to go out on these extremely difficult missions (the opening footage appears to be taken during real basic training). It's a little difficult figuring out who's who but the dialogue between the soldiers feels like it's real.We break into Act II, when Luttrell and three compatriots locate Shah while they're hidden in the bush on the side of a mountain. A sheep herder along with two boys run into the soldiers who now have to decide whether to kill, tie them up or let them go. Ultimately, it's Lutrell who argues they'll be charged with war crimes if they kill the Afghans, so they take their chances by letting them return to the village and then retreat up the mountain.The bulk of the movie involves the four Americans attempting to fend off a big number of Taliban soldiers who are heavily armed with machine guns and rocket launchers (one of young sheep herders is seen scurrying down the mountain earlier, with the intent of alerting the Taliban).Throughout Act II, 'Lone Survivor' proves to be wholly an 'action' film. It's extremely well filmed and choreographed, as the Americans heroically resist against overwhelming odds. At times, they're forced to dive off cliffs and end up rolling down the side of the mountains, injuring themselves severely, but still managing to return fire. Meanwhile, they're unable to phone in their position to headquarters until one of the soldiers manages to get to the top of the mountain, where finally there is radio reception. Unfortunately he's immediately taken down by the Taliban, once exposed with no cover.In some ways, the folly of the initial surveillance mission is exposed. Once their cover is blown, the small surveillance team has no chance of winning against such superior numbers. Certainly, a larger force was needed in the area, to back up the team. Reinforcements do arrive in the form of two manned helicopters, but one is shot down almost immediately by the Taliban and the other is forced to retreat.Once all of his buddies are killed, Luttrell must make his way out of the area after dark. He's saved by a sympathetic Afghan villager who rallies members of his tribe who resist the Taliban who come looking for Luttrell. The Americans are alerted by a mountain man who brings a map of Luttrell's position at the behest of Luttrell's Afghan protector. In reality, the Taliban did not have a face off with the villagers, as the villagers outnumbered them significantly.'Lone Survivor' highlights the heroic actions of the Navy SEALS as well as the Afghan villagers who came to Luttrell's defense. Some critics found the film to be light on characterization but in truth, it's mainly an 'action ' film. Mark Wahlberg proves to be talented as a do or die military man along with his assorted comrades in arms. In the end, nothing is sugar coated here. In a sense, the film is symptomatic of our effort in Afghanistan where noble efforts end in failure, in an unwinnable Afghan imbroglio.",3,Navy SEAL heroics ably highlighted in unwinnable Afghan imbroglio,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,3630,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '3.5', ""5.0'Long"", 'Survivor', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'small', 'Navy', 'SEAL', 'reconnaissance', 'surveillance', 'mission', 'track', 'eventually', 'eliminate', 'Ahmad', 'Shah', 'dangerous', 'Taliban', 'commander', 'already', 'responsible', 'deaths', 'coterie', 'American', 'soldiers', 'Afghan', 'allies', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Marcus', 'Luttrell', 'only', 'survivor', 'fellow', 'four', 'man', 'SEAL', 'team', 'who', 'make', 'way', 'mountains', 'Hindu', 'Kush', 'region', 'Afghanistan.The', 'film', 'divided', 'three', 'main', 'sections', 'opening', 'expository', 'section', 'introduces', 'Navy', 'SEALS', 'participate', 'grueling', 'training', 'go', 'out', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'missions', 'opening', 'footage', 'be', 'taken', 'real', 'basic', 'training', 'little', 'difficult', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'who', 'dialogue', 'soldiers', 'feels', 'real.We', 'break', 'Act', 'II', 'when', 'Luttrell', 'three', 'compatriots', 'locate', 'Shah', ""'re"", 'hidden', 'bush', 'side', 'mountain', 'sheep', 'herder', 'two', 'boys', 'run', 'soldiers', 'who', 'now', 'have', 'decide', 'kill', 'tie', 'up', 'let', 'go', 'Ultimately', 'Lutrell', 'who', ""'ll"", 'be', 'charged', 'war', 'crimes', 'kill', 'Afghans', 'take', 'chances', 'letting', 'return', 'village', 'then', 'retreat', 'up', 'mountain.The', 'bulk', 'movie', 'four', 'Americans', 'attempting', 'fend', 'off', 'big', 'number', 'Taliban', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'heavily', 'armed', 'machine', 'guns', 'rocket', 'launchers', 'one', 'young', 'sheep', 'herders', 'seen', 'scurrying', 'down', 'mountain', 'earlier', 'intent', 'alerting', 'Taliban', '.Throughout', 'Act', 'II', ""'Lone"", 'Survivor', 'proves', 'be', 'wholly', ""'action"", 'film', 'extremely', 'well', 'filmed', 'choreographed', 'Americans', 'heroically', 'resist', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'times', ""'re"", 'forced', 'dive', 'off', 'cliffs', 'end', 'up', 'rolling', 'down', 'side', 'mountains', 'injuring', 'severely', 'still', 'managing', 'return', 'fire', 'Meanwhile', ""'re"", 'unable', 'phone', 'position', 'headquarters', 'one', 'soldiers', 'get', 'top', 'mountain', 'where', 'finally', 'radio', 'reception', 'Unfortunately', 'immediately', 'taken', 'down', 'Taliban', 'once', 'exposed', 'cover.In', 'ways', 'folly', 'initial', 'surveillance', 'mission', 'exposed', 'Once', 'cover', 'blown', 'small', 'surveillance', 'team', 'chance', 'winning', 'such', 'superior', 'numbers', 'Certainly', 'larger', 'force', 'was', 'needed', 'area', 'back', 'up', 'team', 'Reinforcements', 'do', 'arrive', 'form', 'two', 'manned', 'helicopters', 'one', 'shot', 'down', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Taliban', 'other', 'forced', 'retreat.Once', 'buddies', 'are', 'killed', 'Luttrell', 'must', 'make', 'way', 'area', 'dark', 'saved', 'sympathetic', 'Afghan', 'villager', 'who', 'members', 'tribe', 'who', 'resist', 'Taliban', 'who', 'come', 'looking', 'Luttrell', 'Americans', 'are', 'alerted', 'mountain', 'man', 'who', 'map', 'Luttrell', 'position', 'behest', 'Luttrell', 'Afghan', 'protector', 'reality', 'Taliban', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'face', 'villagers', 'villagers', 'outnumbered', 'significantly', ""'Lone"", 'Survivor', 'highlights', 'heroic', 'actions', 'Navy', 'SEALS', 'as', 'well', 'Afghan', 'villagers', 'who', 'came', 'Luttrell', 'defense', 'critics', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'light', 'characterization', 'truth', 'mainly', ""'action"", 'film', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'be', 'talented', 'do', 'die', 'military', 'man', 'assorted', 'comrades', 'arms', 'end', 'nothing', 'sugar', 'coated', 'here', 'sense', 'film', 'symptomatic', 'effort', 'Afghanistan', 'where', 'noble', 'efforts', 'end', 'failure', 'unwinnable', 'Afghan', 'imbroglio']",N/A

I'm angry at the higher ups for not having a better response to rescue them, and I really hated seeing those Marines die. Maybe that's unfair to those higher ups; probably is. Still mad at them! The Marines who died in the helicopter trying to rescue them are just as important to me as the main characters.It was inspiring and gave me hope to see the Afghans who risked their lives to rescue Mark's character. But the movie is plotless. Don't watch it if all you want is entertainment; it's not about entertainment. The only development in it is when you realize what good buddies these guys were, and their integrity and honor, and their courage. It has Mark Wahlberg in it. Love his acting but his acting is not the point. If you are imagining a gripping story like ""Shooter,"" forget it. It's just about killing Americans, and it hurts.I loved the relationship between Mark Littrell and the little boy. I hope that really happened.Once in college years ago, I took out a sensitive art student and we went to see ""Bonnie and Clyde."" At the end, the terrible shooting that ended their lives was so bloody that she just said ""Take me home."" She never went out with me again. That is how I feel about this movie. The pain it produced in me was that bad.I just watched the movie ""Murph the Protector."" That's about the Seal Mike Murphy, same one who gave his life in ""Sole Survivor"" making the radio call for help. Again, it's not ""entertaining"" but it is supremely meaningful. Another movie in this genre is ""Taking Chance,"" about taking a Marine home from the war in a casket. Not entertaining; but meaningful and makes you cry.

Their mission was to capture or kill a notorious Taliban leader.After confirming his identity and setting up an OP they were disturbed by local shepherds who they had to set free. This led to the SEALs trying to out-run an enemy force of 150+ who were in close pursuit through the mountains of Afghanistan resulting in the deaths of three members of SEAL Team 10.Lone Survivor is a true story of how a Special Forces operator survives against outstanding odds even after suffering the deaths of his other team members, Axe (Foster), Dietz (Hirsch) and team leader and best friend Lt Mike Murphy (Kitsch).Although the film doesn't stand up to how PO 1st Class Luttrell survived behind enemy lines injured and dehydrated for four days and the action and realities of war portrayed in the book.

Every aspect of the film is done superbly well, from the acting to the effects, to the settings, to the camera angles, to the dialogue, to the characterization, to the pacing, and the plot.  Just perfect.  If I am not mistaken, some of the cast members were actual military!  They were fantastic.  I dare you to tell them apart from the actual career actors.Lone Survivor is a harrowing thrill ride that will surprise you, scare you, make you cringe, and keep you on the edge of your seat.  It will also tug at your heart-strings and leave you an emotional ball of patriotism, respect (for our military), and sadness (for the great losses we have incurred).Lone Survivor demonstrates why our troops are elite, why they are the modern day Spartans/Romans, why they are the nightmares these evil scumbags in the Middle East wake up crying about.  In this case, the scumbags are Taliban.  A LOT of Taliban.  Versus four soldiers.  Just four.For moviegoers who prefer action films like the Avengers, if you have ever wondered if real life superheroes exist, just watch this film.  These men are the closest human beings will ever get to the fictional Captain America, Punisher, Batman, Hawkeye, Black Panther, etc.Not only is this the most realistic and respectful presentation of our military heroes, but it also manages to humanize and honor the Middle Eastern tribes who have stood with us, helped, and shown compassion as fellow human beings.  It reminds us that there are others a world away who we should love and respect and protect.Now, I hear the movie does not do the book justice.  I had no idea there was a book till today.
