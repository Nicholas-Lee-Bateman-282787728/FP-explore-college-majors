743547,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,B00008K77S,a voice of reason,"[5, 6]","I almost didn't buy this DVD because of the negative reviews I read here and on another site; however, I'm thankful for the few positive reviews that made me decide to give it a chance. I agree that the acting isn't the greatest, but it's not as terrible as some reviewers make it out to be either, with two exceptions: 1) Eric Roberts' marriage proposal is as hokey as can be, and 2) the actor playing Abel Hart/(the original) Jack Cole seems to have studied Bruce Dern's character from the old John Wayne movie ""The Cowboys"" and then decided to take that character to the utmost degree (in other words, his acting gets to be a bit over the top).Beyond that, the story line is an interesting one, though I wish the background to Randy Travis' character and his relationship with his family had been developed a bit better (but I understand that this was a made-for-TV movie and they had time constraints).Primarily, I appreciate the fact that this story had a moral and lacked profanity. Ernest Borgnine's character calling Jack Cole ""a beast"" is far preferable to any of the profane names that he would be called in most Hollywood movies. Needless profanity and sex scenes spoil my enjoyment of many an (otherwise) good movie, so I can still enjoy films like this one in spite of its shortcomings.",3,"Average acting, yes, but a good, clean film",1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,1299,"['almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'negative', 'reviews', 'read', 'here', 'site', 'however', ""'m"", 'thankful', 'few', 'positive', 'reviews', 'made', 'decide', 'give', 'chance', 'agree', 'acting', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'not', 'as', 'terrible', 'reviewers', 'make', 'be', 'either', 'two', 'exceptions', '1', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'as', 'hokey', 'can', 'be', '2', 'actor', 'playing', 'Abel', 'Hart/', 'original', 'Jack', 'Cole', 'have', 'studied', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'character', 'old', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'Cowboys', 'then', 'decided', 'take', 'character', 'utmost', 'degree', 'other', 'words', 'acting', 'be', 'bit', 'top', '.Beyond', 'story', 'line', 'interesting', 'one', 'wish', 'background', 'Randy', 'Travis', 'character', 'relationship', 'family', 'had', 'been', 'developed', 'bit', 'better', 'understand', 'was', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'had', 'time', 'constraints', '.Primarily', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'story', 'had', 'moral', 'lacked', 'profanity', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'character', 'calling', 'Jack', 'Cole', 'beast', 'far', 'preferable', 'profane', 'names', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Needless', 'profanity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'spoil', 'enjoyment', 'many', 'otherwise', 'good', 'movie', 'can', 'still', 'enjoy', 'films', 'one', 'spite', 'shortcomings']",The Long Ride Home

When I saw Randy Travis had the main role, I was like ""really? another grade B, cheap western"" but it was a Saturday afternoon, I was alone in the house and saw it listed on netflix.  I have to be honost, that I actually liked it.  Randy Travis was not the greatest actor I have ever seen, but turned in a prety good performance.  The story was pretty good and was well filmed and pretty realistic.  I will buy this from Amazon.  They could have found a better kid for the part....his acting was not very good, but overall, this was a good western throughout and worth watching.  Randy surprised me.  He acts better than he sings. (my personal opinion).",4,"Surprisingly, I liked it",1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,825,"['agree', 'reviews', 'was', 'western', 'rotten', 'language', 'sex', 'etc.', 'still', 'had', 'true', 'western', 'violence', 'being', 'top', 'graphics', 'When', 'saw', 'Randy', 'Travis', 'had', 'main', 'role', 'was', 'really', 'grade', 'B', 'cheap', 'western', 'was', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'was', 'alone', 'house', 'saw', 'listed', 'netflix', 'have', 'be', 'honost', 'actually', 'liked', 'Randy', 'Travis', 'was', 'not', 'greatest', 'actor', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'turned', 'prety', 'good', 'performance', 'story', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', 'well', 'filmed', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'will', 'buy', 'Amazon', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'better', 'kid', 'part', '.his', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'was', 'good', 'western', 'worth', 'watching', 'Randy', 'surprised', 'better', 'personal', 'opinion']",The Long Ride Home

So I went into the old movie room and picked out one that I had not seen in a while. I was looking for something not as well known or mainstream so I decided upon this one. &#8220;The Long Ride Home&#8221; starring country singer Randy Travis, Eric Roberts, Vaughn Taylor and Ernest Borgnine is a great family friendly film. It is tough to come across a movie these days that does not have cussing or sex in it as a way to make up for other things.The story follows a man that has been out in the world a long time leaving his wife and son behind. They think he just left but there may have been a reason behind it. He returns home only to find his wife may be getting with another and a son who doesn&#8217;t know him. Add in that there is trouble coming and you have one good little western.I have to say that I really did enjoy this movie and also liked that it was a clean film. There was no cussing or sex in it and while I don&#8217;t mind those things especially when they add to the story I liked that it was not here. This film was written by Vaughn Taylor and Mike Dougherty and I think they did a good job. I wish they would have worked together more to create a few more films, maybe making this into a series of films or something. Taylor has done a few more films but this seems to be Mike&#8217;s only film he has written.The film was directed by Robert Marcarelli and I think he did a great job as well along with the writers. Now this is not the most action packed western ever or even the best but it is a good little flick. It stars country singer Randy Travis as the man who comes back and he fits the role well. Eric Roberts is great as always as the wife&#8217;s new love interest and Ernest Borgnine is always excellent. Now I mentioned writer Vaughn Taylor earlier, well she also stars in this as Travis&#8217;s wife. She does a great job as well proving to be a good actress as well as writer.Now like I said this isn&#8217;t the best flick ever but it is a good one. It is a good clean family film so all can watch it with no worries but it is still entertaining. I would recommend this movie to any western film fan out there. It may not be a classic but it is five star clean entertainment.",5,GOOD CLEAN FUN,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,2344,"['LONG', 'RIDE', 'HOMEI', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'westerns', 'lately', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'watching', 'as', 'much', 'used', 'So', 'went', 'old', 'movie', 'room', 'picked', 'out', 'one', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'while', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'mainstream', 'so', 'decided', 'one', '8220', 'Long', 'Ride', 'Home', '8221', 'starring', 'country', 'singer', 'Randy', 'Travis', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'Vaughn', 'Taylor', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'great', 'family', 'friendly', 'film', 'tough', 'come', 'movie', 'days', 'not', 'have', 'cussing', 'sex', 'way', 'make', 'up', 'other', 'things.The', 'story', 'man', 'been', 'out', 'world', 'long', 'time', 'leaving', 'wife', 'son', 'behind', 'think', 'just', 'left', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'reason', 'home', 'only', 'find', 'wife', 'may', 'be', 'getting', 'son', 'who', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'know', 'Add', 'trouble', 'coming', 'have', 'one', 'good', 'little', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'also', 'liked', 'was', 'clean', 'film', 'was', 'cussing', 'sex', 'don', '8217', 'mind', 'things', 'especially', 'when', 'add', 'story', 'liked', 'was', 'not', 'here', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'Vaughn', 'Taylor', 'Mike', 'Dougherty', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'together', 'more', 'create', 'few', 'more', 'films', 'maybe', 'making', 'series', 'films', 'something', 'Taylor', 'done', 'few', 'more', 'films', 'be', 'Mike', '8217', 'only', 'film', 'written.The', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Marcarelli', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'writers', 'Now', 'not', 'most', 'action', 'packed', 'western', 'ever', 'even', 'best', 'good', 'little', 'flick', 'country', 'singer', 'Randy', 'Travis', 'man', 'who', 'back', 'role', 'well', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'great', 'as', 'always', 'wife', '8217', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'always', 'excellent', 'Now', 'mentioned', 'writer', 'Vaughn', 'Taylor', 'earlier', 'well', 'also', 'Travis', '8217', 's', 'wife', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'proving', 'be', 'good', 'actress', 'as', 'well', 'writer.Now', 'said', 'isn', '8217', 'best', 'flick', 'ever', 'good', 'one', 'good', 'clean', 'family', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'worries', 'still', 'entertaining', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'western', 'film', 'fan', 'there', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'classic', 'five', 'star', 'clean', 'entertainment']",The Long Ride Home
