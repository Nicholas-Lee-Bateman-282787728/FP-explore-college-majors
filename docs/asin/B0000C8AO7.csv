Plus the choice of games on this DVD are more the ""significant"" nature rather than actual ""great"" games. The Oilers DVD is unlike that at all.

773931,A1FV5LUUWMMAN5,B0000C8AO7,M. Johnson,"[6, 6]","This is a nice DVD set and a very good review of 99's remarkable career.  John Davidson interviews Wayne and the conversation between the two is smooth and never seems forced.  Certain sections are introduced by Keifer Sutherland.  I can't say it's a complete look at his career (nothing on his brief stint with St. Louis) which is why I didn't give this set five stars.  With the exception of the game where Wayne scores his 802nd career goal (Vancouver's broadcast of the game is the one on here), all games are CBC telecasts.  The games are all restored and look and sound as good as they could possibly be.  You'll either like or be annoyed by the removal of a lot of the time between faceoffs of the games.
