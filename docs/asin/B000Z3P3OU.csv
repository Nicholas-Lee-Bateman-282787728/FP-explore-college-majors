1121209,A30OGYCJM4B10S,B000Z3P3OU,atisheh,"[0, 0]","The video consists of several sections:Calmness and SimplicityYou and Your MusicFocus and Energy ProjectionExercisesThe four ""theoretical"" sections feature one or more brief introductions by Michelle Joyce which are then followed by full-length dance clips of dancers: Adriana, Nanna Candelaria, Sandra, Shoshanna, Zari, Zaheea, and Michelle herself. As you watch each clip, the dancer ""narrates,"" reflecting on the dance you're watching or her dancing in general.There are some truly memorable moments. For example, in the ""Calmness and Simplicity"" section, Adriana describes performing a glass dance in which the glasses cracked when she stepped on them. In the video, you cannot see her bat an eyelid out of time, but to hear her tell it, the crack was so loud that the front rows of the audience heard it.In Adriana's clip, the narration tells you the backstory behind a dance. In other cases, the dancer speaking teaches you how to see what is in front of your eyes. Zari performs a haunting dance to ""Ana Bin Tezarek,"" and part of what makes it so haunting, you learn, is the way she changes focus between her body, the audience, and so on. I think I would have noticed that Zari dances with varied expression and that she uses her eyes wonderfully, but I wouldn't have known that it's not just about looking up or down, but about guiding the audience's interest in a certain conscious way. This doesn't just tell me how to learn from Zari, but is also a kind of training in how to watch other dancers, what to look for, how to learn the craft.One of the things I loved about this video was discovering a number of dancers I really, really enjoy watching. While all were lovely, I'm left wanting hours more of Zari, Sandra, and Nanna, all very different from each other, but all embodying qualities I adore about the dance. Another quality I loved was the focus on simplicity in the first section. There are a ton of bellydance instructionals out there that will teach you how to accomplish complicated drills and combinations, but how many, even five years later, reinforce the idea that simplicity in dance can also be beautiful and delicious to watch?Finally, the exercises. There is a guided relaxation, a chair exercise in which you only dance with your upper body, an improv exercise in which you dance to the same short clip of music four times without repeating your movements, and a brief focus exercise in which you place your focus with intention. I did all of these (minus the guided relaxation) on a different day, when I was warmed up from another workout. And frankly, I thought they were kind of genius.The chair exercise really forces you to exploit the movement potential of your upper body -- chest, hands and arms, head, facial expressions. The improv exercise features seven different musical clips, and not only did it prompt me to be creative and to move across the floor more than I usually would, but it also made me listen to how different the clips were from each other musically, how each one ""asked"" me to perform different kinds of movements. The focus exercise was brief -- I need to practice it with my own music -- but I found it took my attention from my own body and its movements to points outside my body. This changed the feeling of dancing completely, and really allowed my body to react to the music on its own, without as much interference from me -- if that makes any sense!Even though I watched Secrets of the Stage Volume One all the way through twice and did the exercises, I feel I've barely begun to scratch the surface. There is so much information in here, too much to absorb all at once, and the real test will be to practice the exercises with my own music. Still, I found the video marvelously liberating -- this is really a program about dancing rather than about performing a series of movements in a certain way, and as such, it is deeply pleasurable both to watch and to work with.",5,A wonderful reflection on the subtleties of dancing,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,3943,"['video', 'several', 'sections', 'Calmness', 'SimplicityYou', 'Your', 'MusicFocus', 'Energy', 'ProjectionExercisesThe', 'four', 'theoretical', 'sections', 'feature', 'one', 'more', 'brief', 'introductions', 'Michelle', 'Joyce', 'are', 'then', 'followed', 'full-length', 'dance', 'clips', 'dancers', 'Adriana', 'Nanna', 'Candelaria', 'Sandra', 'Shoshanna', 'Zari', 'Zaheea', 'Michelle', 'watch', 'clip', 'dancer', 'narrates', 'reflecting', 'dance', ""'re"", 'watching', 'dancing', 'general.There', 'are', 'truly', 'memorable', 'moments', 'example', 'Calmness', 'Simplicity', 'section', 'Adriana', 'performing', 'glass', 'dance', 'glasses', 'cracked', 'when', 'stepped', 'video', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'bat', 'eyelid', 'time', 'hear', 'tell', 'crack', 'was', 'so', 'loud', 'front', 'rows', 'audience', 'heard', 'Adriana', 'clip', 'narration', 'backstory', 'dance', 'other', 'cases', 'dancer', 'speaking', 'teaches', 'how', 'see', 'what', 'front', 'eyes', 'Zari', 'haunting', 'dance', 'Ana', 'Bin', 'Tezarek', 'part', 'what', 'so', 'haunting', 'learn', 'way', 'focus', 'body', 'audience', 'so', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'noticed', 'Zari', 'dances', 'varied', 'expression', 'eyes', 'wonderfully', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'known', 'not', 'just', 'looking', 'up', 'down', 'guiding', 'audience', 'interest', 'certain', 'conscious', 'way', ""n't"", 'just', 'tell', 'how', 'learn', 'Zari', 'also', 'kind', 'training', 'how', 'watch', 'other', 'dancers', 'what', 'look', 'how', 'learn', 'craft.One', 'things', 'loved', 'video', 'was', 'discovering', 'number', 'dancers', 'really', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'were', 'lovely', ""'m"", 'left', 'wanting', 'hours', 'more', 'Zari', 'Sandra', 'Nanna', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'embodying', 'qualities', 'adore', 'dance', 'quality', 'loved', 'was', 'focus', 'simplicity', 'first', 'section', 'are', 'ton', 'bellydance', 'instructionals', 'out', 'there', 'will', 'teach', 'how', 'accomplish', 'complicated', 'drills', 'combinations', 'how', 'many', 'even', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'reinforce', 'idea', 'simplicity', 'dance', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'beautiful', 'delicious', 'watch', 'Finally', 'exercises', 'guided', 'relaxation', 'chair', 'exercise', 'only', 'dance', 'upper', 'body', 'improv', 'exercise', 'dance', 'same', 'short', 'clip', 'music', 'four', 'times', 'repeating', 'movements', 'brief', 'focus', 'exercise', 'place', 'focus', 'intention', 'did', 'guided', 'relaxation', 'different', 'day', 'when', 'was', 'warmed', 'up', 'workout', 'frankly', 'thought', 'were', 'kind', 'genius.The', 'chair', 'exercise', 'really', 'exploit', 'movement', 'potential', 'upper', 'body', 'chest', 'hands', 'arms', 'head', 'facial', 'expressions', 'improv', 'exercise', 'features', 'seven', 'different', 'musical', 'clips', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'prompt', 'be', 'creative', 'move', 'floor', 'more', 'usually', 'would', 'also', 'made', 'listen', 'how', 'different', 'clips', 'were', 'other', 'musically', 'how', 'one', 'asked', 'perform', 'different', 'kinds', 'movements', 'focus', 'exercise', 'was', 'brief', 'need', 'practice', 'own', 'music', 'found', 'took', 'attention', 'own', 'body', 'movements', 'points', 'body', 'changed', 'feeling', 'dancing', 'completely', 'really', 'allowed', 'body', 'react', 'music', 'own', 'as', 'much', 'interference', 'sense', 'Even', 'watched', 'Secrets', 'Stage', 'Volume', 'One', 'way', 'twice', 'did', 'exercises', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'barely', 'begun', 'scratch', 'surface', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'here', 'too', 'much', 'absorb', 'once', 'real', 'test', 'will', 'be', 'practice', 'exercises', 'own', 'music', 'Still', 'found', 'video', 'marvelously', 'liberating', 'really', 'program', 'dancing', 'rather', 'performing', 'series', 'movements', 'certain', 'way', 'such', 'deeply', 'pleasurable', 'watch', 'work']",Secrets of the Stage Volume One: A Performance Course for Belly Dancers by Michelle Joyce

1121215,ASXXZIFEKXJK6,B000Z3P3OU,"Melissa A. Cain ""Misha""","[6, 8]","Someone once asked me ""If you could only have one DVD in your collection, what would it be?""I think I'm going to have to go with this one.""Secrets of the Stage"" is quite possibly the best works I've seen. From the amount of material presented, to the clear and concise descriptions, to the exercises and performances, to the price, this DVD is a must-have for any dancer interested in performing. It's pretty rare for me to define anything as a ""must have,"" but I can definitely say that this video can benefit *any* belly dancer, regardless of style, who wants to step out onto the stage. The tips offered by the dancers throughout this video are inspiring and encouraging, making you want to put into practice what they're advising.The DVD is divided into three sections: Calmness and Simplicity, You and Your Music, and Focus and Energy Protection. Designed to help you perfect your performance skills, several of these main categories are further divided into additional parts that complement each main topic. After these ""discussion topics,"" comes a section of exercises that help dancers not only learn from what is covered on the DVD but instantly put it into practice. My favorite feature, as others have mentioned, is that each concept is demonstrated by a clip of a professional dancer in a live, staged setting narrated by the dancer herself. This was absolutely invaluable! How often are you able to get inside the mind of another performer while she or he is dancing? This is such a wonderful addition to this and will definitely help viewers to find new ways to approach their own personal attitude towards performances.Calmness: Michelle first offers a brief explanation of the topic. Then she provides a valuable discussion of why this topic is important for performers. In the Calmness Section, Michelle gives detailed reasons as to why it would benefit you to be calm on stage. She offers numerous tips such as the fact that an audience can pick up on nervousness and that calmness will help you manage any crises that arise. These elaborations were great and went beyond the simple idea of ""be cool and collected"" that we all probably know. Michelle's clear descriptions and honest candidness are refreshing and I found myself really paying attention to what she was saying. The material is presented in such a friendly, open way. I confess that I watched this several times to review it - a few times first to take a ton of notes as I got because I wasn't able to write the review until I jotted down all the juicy bits first for myself!.My favorite part of this section involved the inclusion of clips of herself and another dancer during live staged performances. Through each clip, the performer discusses what was happening (and, yes, these are actual clips of ""could be disastrous"" performances) and what her mindset was while dancing. During each of these sections, the narrators give so many great tips. They move beyond simply explaining what was happening and really give the watcher some excellent pearls of wisdom.Fight or Flight: I'm notorious for having gripping stage fright before performing. I've never been sure where it comes from, but after watching this video I definitely know the basic mechanics of it! Michelle starts with a description of why the body is reacting the way it does when the nerves kick in. It's great that she included this, because *knowing* why your body is behaving in this manner can really help when trying to correct it. Along with additional exercises elsewhere in the DVD, Michelle next offers some excellent exercises to relive tension before performing.Simplicity: Here Michelle talks about the idea of ""over dancing."" I was so glad to see this included, because this is something that seems to be creeping into our dances more and more with the luxury of so many wonderful ideas via the intent and so many great dance DVDs. If you're a dancer that feels preoccupied with the idea of doing as much as you can at one time this section will help you to slow down and appreciate the idea of simplicity in dance. Over thinking your performances? This part will certainly help. The two dance performances included are beautiful and clearly illustrate this idea and once again the accompanying narration traces the dancers' thoughts on the subjects. It is helpful to get their impressions, too, in addition to Michelle's thoughts. Here the idea that ""less is more"" is beautifully illustrated.You and Your Music: This is a section that, once again, offers a number of valuable tips for those perfecting their performances and pros alike. ""Your job as a dancer is to interpret the music for the audience,"" begins Michelle and from there she offers a different sort of approach to using the music. She explains the way she personally approaches musical interpretation and the different things that a dancer can listen for in each song. Everything from more basic ideas of the beat vs. the melody to more advanced concepts such as specifically selecting certain sections of the music to highlight is included here for the aspiring performer. Michelle also talks here about choreography versus improvisation, and offers tips on how to begin improvising for those who are not quite sure how to dance fluidly without a plan. Three clips are offered here - one performance where the dancer discusses how she improves and two wherein the dancers discuss how they choreography and get ready to utilize movements.Focus and Energy Protection: Have you ever seen a dancer that has ""it?"" That sparkle onstage that compels you to watch, regardless of how complicated her movements or how pretty her costume? If you're wondering how it is those dancers *do* that, this is the section for you. Here Michelle talks about different ways to project emotion and intent onstage. She talks about how to make a connection with not just the audience as a whole but each individual, describing ways to focus and captivate your audience. Here the two dances selected to illustrate the topic are quite different, giving two dramatically distinct examples of focus and emotion.Exercises: Michelle includes resources to improve relaxing, improvisational skills, and one's focus. The relaxation exercises move beyond what was briefly covered in the Calmness section. Drawing from sports psychology, Michelle has created a very useful 11 minute long exercise for those dancers with pre-performance jitters. The next study focuses on improvisation. First comes a ""chair dance"" where dancers are encouraged to sit down, focus on the upper body, and get creative! Michelle demonstrates how the exercise should go and then reminds dancers to do it on their own in order to get the most benefit from it. This was a wonderful way to see how another dancer would approach this challenge, while providing dancers with a wonderful improvisational exercise. The second improv exercise is truly designed to help dancers improve their ability to dance to music on the fly. Michelle encourages dancers to be uninhibited and enjoy whatever comes out in order to grow as a performer. During the exercise, the viewer has an opportunity to listen and then perform to the clip. For each of the clips the dancer can do this 4 times and must do something differently each time. Afterwards, there is an example of how the different featured dancers on the DVD interpret the same music. There are a total of 7 different clips that vary in style, giving a wide range of music to practice improvisation. The focus exercise is shot but sweet and once again perfectly illustrates the previously discussed concepts.After watching this through once, I put it in again. And again. And again. This is definitely a DVD that will have you up and dancing and will inspire you to grow as a performer. Highly recommended!What Worked for Me:* Many of Michelle's points are concepts that are not often taught in dance classes; ideas that one often only learns through years of performance practice. These are absolutely invaluable and it is wonderful to have them all conveniently collected in one place.* Michelle is a great instructor. Once again, it is clear that she really knows what she is talking about and can put it into practice.* The inclusion of performances to illustrate each section definitely helped me to visualize the concepts Michelle explains. The fact that she included different dancers in addition to herself was also great - different styles are covered from several talented performers.* The price for the DVD in terms of what you are getting is absolutely affordable. Michelle delivers a wonderful piece for an incredibly reasonable price.What Might Not Work for You:* Honestly, there isn't much at all. This is one of the few DVDs I've seen that is a ""MUST"" have for anyone considering performing. The only reason this might not work for you is if you didn't want to perform!",5,A DVD Every Dancer Should Own,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,8896,"['Someone', 'once', 'asked', 'could', 'only', 'have',

The narrator has a friendly, down-to-earth style, and a clear speaking voice. I particularly enjoyed the segments where performers told us in their own words about their struggles with stage props, stage fright, and their solutions for various performance issues---these segments were voiced-over their actual performances. The segment with the performer dancing on goblets was particularly enlightening for me. The segment of relaxation exercises at the end would be useful to those who have issues with stage fright. This DVD has good photography and played fine on my DVD player, but I was not able to get it to play on my computer.

This is a super valuable DVD. It's unlike anything else on the market and I know of very few teachers who cover this material.There are three sections, whose names I can't exactly remember. The topics covered include Conquering Stage Fright, Slowing Down and Accepting Simplicity, Knowing Your Music, Focus and Energy, Choreography or Improvisation. Each section has a short lecture by Michelle Joyce, who is an engaging speaker. Then, there are 2-3 clips of dancers. Each clip shows the dancer performing, but has a voiceover by the dancer talking about the topic. This is a really great way to keep your interest on the screen! I really enjoyed hearing some of my favorite dancers talk about how they put together a choreography or improvisational dance, how they listen to music, how they fight stage fright, and handle issues on stage. There were certain issues that came up that really really resonated with me, like Nanna and Sandra both talking about how new dancers often feel they have to really impress the audience and be doing something complex and amazing all the time, but i'ts really okay to do a simple move and execute it really really well. I don't want to give away the ""secrets"" since the reason you watch the DVD is to hear this advice. But suffice to say that there was a lot in there that a beginning performer needs & wants to hear.Some of the sections also had exercises. The relaxation techniques could be really useful for me. I'm going to try them this Sunday at my next gig. I tried the improvisational exercise. It was really good music for such an exercise. However, you were supposed to try different moves to the same music 4 different times and there wasn't enough distinguishment between one time and the next. (it just restarts - there's no announcement that time #2 is about to happen.) So I wasn't sure when to start over and reinterpret. Without knowing the music really well, anyway. I'm a pretty confident improviser and I probably won't use this exercise anyway. But it's a really good exercise to teach improvisation as it's how we learned in other classes. It was a good idea to make the screen black so that you couldn't look at the screen to follow along.Anyway, I just loved it. I'm seeing it as something I will stick in and watch to psyche myself up before I go do a show. Sometimes I watch performance dvds before a show but those sometimes just make me feel less confident, because I start comparing myself to the dancers. But this DVD has a lot of tips that will remind me to stay calm and project energy.Great production quality. And I really like Michelle's personality. I will probably pick up some of her other DVDs now",5,a gem for the performing bellydancer,1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,2797,"['Just', 'quick', 'one.I', 'got', 'DVD', 'early', 'Christmas', 'present', 'okay', 'opened', 'early', 'watched', 'weekend', 'super', 'valuable', 'DVD', 'anything', 'else', 'market', 'know', 'very', 'few', 'teachers', 'who', 'cover', 'are', 'three', 'sections', 'names', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'remember', 'topics', 'covered', 'include', 'Conquering', 'Stage', 'Fright', 'Slowing', 'Down', 'Accepting', 'Simplicity', 'Knowing', 'Music', 'Focus', 'Energy', 'Choreography', 'Improvisation', 'section', 'short', 'lecture', 'Michelle', 'Joyce', 'who', 'engaging', 'speaker', 'Then', 'are', '2-3', 'clips', 'dancers', 'clip', 'dancer', 'performing', 'voiceover', 'dancer', 'talking', 'topic', 'really', 'great', 'way', 'keep', 'interest', 'screen', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'hearing', 'favorite', 'dancers', 'talk', 'how', 'put', 'together', 'choreography', 'improvisational', 'dance', 'how', 'listen', 'music', 'how', 'fight', 'stage', 'fright', 'handle', 'issues', 'stage', 'were', 'certain', 'issues', 'came', 'up', 'really', 'really', 'resonated', 'Nanna', 'Sandra', 'talking', 'how', 'new', 'dancers', 'often', 'feel', 'have', 'really', 'impress', 'audience', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'complex', 'amazing', 'time', ""i'ts"", 'really', 'okay', 'do', 'simple', 'move', 'execute', 'really', 'really', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'secrets', 'reason', 'watch', 'DVD', 'hear', 'advice', 'suffice', 'say', 'was', 'lot', 'beginning', 'performer', 'needs', 'hear.Some', 'sections', 'also', 'had', 'exercises', 'relaxation', 'techniques', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'useful', ""'m"", 'going', 'try', 'Sunday', 'next', 'gig', 'tried', 'improvisational', 'exercise', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'music', 'such', 'exercise', 'However', 'were', 'supposed', 'try', 'different', 'moves', 'same', 'music', '4', 'different', 'times', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'distinguishment', 'one', 'time', 'next', 'just', 'announcement', 'time', '2', 'happen', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'when', 'start', 'reinterpret', 'knowing', 'music', 'really', 'well', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'confident', 'improviser', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'use', 'exercise', 'anyway', 'really', 'good', 'exercise', 'teach', 'improvisation', 'how', 'learned', 'other', 'classes', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'make', 'screen', 'black', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'screen', 'follow', 'along.Anyway', 'just', 'loved', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'something', 'will', 'stick', 'watch', 'psyche', 'up', 'go', 'do', 'show', 'Sometimes', 'watch', 'performance', 'dvds', 'show', 'sometimes', 'just', 'make', 'feel', 'less', 'confident', 'start', 'comparing', 'dancers', 'DVD', 'lot', 'tips', 'will', 'remind', 'stay', 'calm', 'project', 'energy.Great', 'production', 'quality', 'really', 'Michelle', 'personality', 'will', 'probably', 'pick', 'up', 'other', 'DVDs', 'now']",Secrets of the Stage Volume One: A Performance Course for Belly Dancers by Michelle Joyce

As described, this dvd uses belly dance performance clips and interviews with the dancers to demonstrate different stage presentation techniques. It also includes a number of exercises for the viewer to use to explore the ideas and techniques. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it takes a little time to fully absorb the content and I am still working on it.This dvd is not for everyone. It may not interest dancers who:*Are new to bellydance / Oriental Dance and want to learn the techniques.*Want a dance workout--this dvd does not include a workout or any dance technique*Who want to learn choreographies or combinations as it does not teach any.This will interest dancers who:*Are interested in performing (even just for friends and family)! Any bellydancer interested in performing may find something of interest starting at an advanced-beginners level.*Performers who suffer get nervous when they perform! This dvd has great tips for staying calm and giving a great performance even when things don't go as planned. It also contains short exercises that can be done back stage to use a little nervous energy and a guided relaxation exercise.*Dancers looking to improve their performance improvisation ability. The dvd contains tips on improv. and also a great exercise that uses 7 different musical clips taken from performances on this dvd.*Performers who are always looking for ideas to improve their performances!The performance clips are well-filmed. The lighting and sets are clear and attractive so you can see the dancer. The dancers are all beautifully costumed and the narration feels very conversational. I believe all the clips come from volumes one and two of the ""By Dancers For Dancers"" performance dvd. I have not seen these dvds, but will certainly look forward to purchasing them in the future to see the complete performances!Overall, I am most impressed with the way this dvd combines ""airy"", abstract ideas like energy projection with visual examples and exploratory exercises to make the concepts more concrete.
