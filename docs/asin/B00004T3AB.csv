550059,A34HEERDCR5UTU,B00004T3AB,Allan Life,"[2, 2]","When it debuted on British television a generation ago, this five-part docudrama on the Bronts was acclaimed by viewers ranging from specialists in the writings of the family to people who had never read a line of their works. Today, the series looks as good as ever (if not better), an impressive fact given the sheer amount of Bront scholarship published in the last three decades. Even in 1973, however, Christopher Fry in his screenplay could draw on separate biographies of all four Bront siblings by Winifred G&eacute;rin, in addition to Mrs. Gaskell's 1857 life of Charlotte Bront, which is a touchstone of the series. It seems that Fry resolved to restrict himself to events in the family history that could be documented; this precludes high-flying recreations of Emily's mysticism, Branwell's supposed influence on his sisters' fiction, and Charlotte's alleged destruction of manuscripts bequeathed her by Emily and Ann. Consequently, mounting controversies on such topics have left the screenplay unscathed. Even when Fry improvises dialogue and violates strict chronology, he never strays from the plausible. Not that this concern with verification lacks its penalties. While Emily is often seen writing or reading, the subjects of these activities are scarcely ever divulged. A particular letdown is the failure to acknowledge Emily's six months at Law Hill near Halifax, where (as G&eacute;rin argues in an entire chapter of her biography), this great author may have conceived a narrative that evolved into ""Wuthering Heights."" By contrast, her dissipated brother Branwell gets a lion's share of screen time, recollected as he was by anybody who got drunk with him. More justice is done to Ann, the Cinderella of the family in 1973 but (thanks in part to Christopher Fry) acknowledged today as an important author. The recreation by Fry of Charlotte Bront should fascinate any reader of her works.The screenplay comes to life in the film. Haworth Parsonage, where most of these events occurred, is vividly evoked, heightening the immediacy (and poignancy) of what are already inspired performances. Alfred Burke, as the Rev. Patrick Bront, is so perfect that the good gentleman himself seems to have been resurrected to star in the series. His four children are marvelously impersonated, and Emily, who says relatively little, becomes a focal presence thanks to the speaking silences of Rosemary McHale. Unquestionably, this series will prove most enjoyable to people with some prior knowledge of the subject. But geniuses are human, and the humanity of these portrayals can be felt by any receptive viewer.",5,The Evolution of Genius,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,2622,"['When', 'debuted', 'British', 'television', 'generation', 'ago', 'five-part', 'docudrama', 'Bronts', 'was', 'acclaimed', 'viewers', 'ranging', 'specialists', 'writings', 'family', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'line', 'works', 'Today', 'series', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'not', 'better', 'impressive', 'fact', 'given', 'sheer', 'amount', 'Bront', 'scholarship', 'published', 'last', 'three', 'decades', 'Even', '1973', 'however', 'Christopher', 'Fry', 'screenplay', 'could', 'draw', 'separate', 'biographies', 'four', 'Bront', 'siblings', 'Winifred', 'G', 'eacute', 'rin', 'addition', 'Mrs.', 'Gaskell', '1857', 'life', 'Charlotte', 'Bront', 'touchstone', 'series', 'Fry', 'resolved', 'restrict', 'events', 'family', 'history', 'could', 'be', 'documented', 'high-flying', 'recreations', 'Emily', 'mysticism', 'Branwell', 'supposed', 'influence', 'sisters', 'fiction', 'Charlotte', 'alleged', 'destruction', 'manuscripts', 'bequeathed', 'Emily', 'Ann', 'Consequently', 'mounting', 'controversies', 'such', 'topics', 'have', 'left', 'screenplay', 'unscathed', 'Even', 'when', 'Fry', 'dialogue', 'strict', 'chronology', 'never', 'plausible', 'Not', 'concern', 'verification', 'penalties', 'Emily', 'often', 'seen', 'writing', 'reading', 'subjects', 'activities', 'are', 'scarcely', 'ever', 'divulged', 'particular', 'letdown', 'failure', 'acknowledge', 'Emily', 'six', 'months', 'Law', 'Hill', 'Halifax', 'where', 'G', 'eacute', 'rin', 'entire', 'chapter', 'biography', 'great', 'author', 'may', 'have', 'conceived', 'narrative', 'evolved', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'contrast', 'dissipated', 'brother', 'Branwell', 'lion', 'share', 'screen', 'time', 'recollected', 'was', 'anybody', 'who', 'got', 'drunk', 'More', 'justice', 'done', 'Ann', 'Cinderella', 'family', '1973', 'thanks', 'part', 'Christopher', 'Fry', 'acknowledged', 'today', 'important', 'author', 'recreation', 'Fry', 'Charlotte', 'Bront', 'should', 'fascinate', 'reader', 'works.The', 'screenplay', 'life', 'film', 'Haworth', 'Parsonage', 'where', 'most', 'events', 'occurred', 'vividly', 'evoked', 'heightening', 'immediacy', 'poignancy', 'what', 'are', 'already', 'inspired', 'performances', 'Alfred', 'Burke', 'Rev', 'Patrick', 'Bront', 'so', 'perfect', 'good', 'gentleman', 'have', 'been', 'resurrected', 'star', 'series', 'four', 'children', 'are', 'marvelously', 'impersonated', 'Emily', 'who', 'relatively', 'little', 'focal', 'presence', 'thanks', 'speaking', 'silences', 'Rosemary', 'McHale', 'Unquestionably', 'series', 'will', 'prove', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'people', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'subject', 'geniuses', 'are', 'human', 'humanity', 'portrayals', 'can', 'be', 'felt', 'receptive', 'viewer']",N/A

It was well acted and very believable.",5,Interesting story of the family Bronte at the parsonage at Haworth.,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,172,"['enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Vickery', 'Turner', 'who', 'played', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'also', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'who', 'was', 'troubled', 'brother', 'who', 'died', 'young', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'very', 'believable']",N/A
550062,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B00004T3AB,Jon Wynne,"[0, 0]","Watching this exceptional five-part series about the Bronte family of artists is a fascinating experience. Consider this: a widowed country clergyman has six children to raise (with help from his sister-in-law and a devoted housekeeper). The two eldest children have died before the story begins. This leaves son Branwell, who everyone describes as brilliant and destined for artistic greatness, and his three sisters, Charlotte, Emily and Anne. If you didn&#8217;t already know that the three sisters were to achieve literary greatness with their respective novels JANE EYRE, WUTHERING HEIGHTS and THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL among others, you would never in a million years expect the artistic muse to descend as it did on this humble household. Isolated in northern England, living most of their lives in the parsonage, surrounded by an enormous graveyard (with the resultant effects on sanitation), and with little artistic influence at hand apart from the books they read. It&#8217;s an artistic miracle.Yet that is precisely what happened. The real tragedy here is that son Branwell failed to live up to his prospects. There is an underlying theme of sexism at play here. Everyone expects the sole male child to succeed while the women are given nary a nod. And when they do begin to write and find success, they have to do so under male pen names. This sets up an amusing scene when two of the sisters travel to London to meet their publisher to prove to him that their books are written a) by different authors (he thought one person had written all their works) and b) that they were female. Of course this thinking was very much of the time and the injustice is not belaboured. It is just one aspect of an incredible true story that is unparalleled in the annals of literature.Christopher Fry&#8217;s brilliant script is at times poetical and subtle, in keeping with the best of this great poet/playwright&#8217;s work. It is fitting for an author of his calibre to have undertaken the story of this unique and tragic family.Brother Branwell is played by a very young Michael Kitchen, who will be particularly well-known in North America for his brilliant work on &#8220;Foyle&#8217;s War&#8221;. Kitchen&#8217;s career got off to a great start straight out of drama school when he was signed by a top agent who recognized his exceptional talent. He was 25 when this series was made and he gives a beautifully-nuanced performance.Alfred Burke, known for his long and varied career&#8211;he died only last February at the age of 92&#8211;gives weight as the Bronte patriarch, Reverend Patrick Bronte. Apparently he had a lifetime habit of announcing when he was going to bed, which always ended with the gentle admonishment to his daughters not to stay up too late. This is gently humourous, and also shows the father&#8217;s undemonstrative affection for his girls.Vickery Turner (once married to the great Warren Oates!) is particularly good as Charlotte Bronte, who outlived all her siblings. She seems the nearest to finding happiness in her short life. The Brontes were a tragic family, though it was not uncommon at this time for people to die young.This is low-key but compelling drama, produced and performed with a sure hand. Lovers of Brontean literature will revel in the details of the lives of this family of artists. The dampness of life next to a wind-swept moor is well-created and lovingly brought to the screen.Barbara Leigh-Hunt, a wonderful actor not nearly known well enough in North America (she&#8217;s a contemporary of, and every bit as good as, Judi Dench) holds the narrative together, playing the historically-true Bronte biographer Elizabeth Gaskell, narrating in the first four episodes and appearing in the last.It is a well-known historical fact that the Bronte children all died young. The last scene shows father Bronte, sitting alone before the fire, wearing as always his high, preferred &#8220;Wellington&#8221;-style collar. He gives a short soliloquy on why he thinks life has unfolded as it has, why he has lost all his children. It is deeply poetic, beautiful, tragic and as haunting as the great words woven together by this trio of tragic sisters. This is the genius of Christopher Fry, finding the right words to end this history which asks more questions than it can answer.THE BRONTES OF HAWORTH is fine, intelligent biographical drama.",5,Brilliant series,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,4391,"['Watching', 'exceptional', 'five-part', 'series', 'Bronte', 'family', 'artists', 'fascinating', 'experience', 'Consider', 'widowed', 'country', 'clergyman', 'six', 'children', 'raise', 'help', 'sister-in-law', 'devoted', 'housekeeper', 'two', 'eldest', 'children', 'have', 'died', 'story', 'son', 'Branwell', 'who', 'everyone', 'brilliant', 'destined', 'artistic', 'greatness', 'three', 'sisters', 'Charlotte', 'Emily', 'Anne', 'didn', '8217', 'already', 'know', 'three', 'sisters', 'were', 'achieve', 'literary', 'greatness', 'respective', 'novels', 'JANE', 'EYRE', 'WUTHERING', 'HEIGHTS', 'THE', 'TENANT', 'OF', 'WILDFELL', 'HALL', 'others', 'would', 'never', 'million', 'years', 'expect', 'artistic', 'muse', 'descend', 'did', 'humble', 'household', 'Isolated', 'northern', 'England', 'living', 'most', 'lives', 'parsonage', 'surrounded', 'enormous', 'graveyard', 'resultant', 'effects', 'sanitation', 'little', 'artistic', 'influence', 'hand', 'apart', 'books', 'read', '8217', 'artistic', 'miracle.Yet', 'precisely', 'what', 'happened', 'real', 'tragedy', 'here', 'son', 'Branwell', 'failed', 'live', 'up', 'prospects', 'underlying', 'theme', 'sexism', 'play', 'here', 'Everyone', 'sole', 'male', 'child', 'succeed', 'women', 'are', 'given', 'nary', 'nod', 'when', 'do', 'begin', 'write', 'find', 'success', 'have', 'do', 'so', 'male', 'pen', 'names', 'up', 'amusing', 'scene', 'when', 'two', 'sisters', 'travel', 'London', 'meet', 'publisher', 'prove', 'books', 'are', 'written', 'different', 'authors', 'thought', 'one', 'person', 'had', 'written', 'works', 'b', 'were', 'female', 'course', 'thinking', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'time', 'injustice', 'not', 'belaboured', 'just', 'one', 'aspect', 'incredible', 'true', 'story', 'unparalleled', 'annals', 'literature.Christopher', 'Fry', '8217', 'brilliant', 'script', 'times', 'poetical', 'subtle', 'keeping', 'best', 'great', 'poet/playwright', '8217', 's', 'work', 'fitting', 'author', 'calibre', 'have', 'undertaken', 'story', 'unique', 'tragic', 'family.Brother', 'Branwell', 'played', 'very', 'young', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'particularly', 'well-known', 'North', 'America', 'brilliant', 'work', '8220', 'Foyle', '8217', 'War', '8221', 'Kitchen', '8217', 'career', 'got', 'off', 'great', 'start', 'straight', 'drama', 'school', 'when', 'was', 'signed', 'top', 'agent', 'who', 'recognized', 'exceptional', 'talent', 'was', '25', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'beautifully-nuanced', 'performance.Alfred', 'Burke', 'known', 'long', 'varied', 'career', '8211', 'died', 'only', 'last', 'February', 'age', '92', '8211', 'weight', 'Bronte', 'patriarch', 'Reverend', 'Patrick', 'Bronte', 'Apparently', 'had', 'lifetime', 'habit', 'announcing', 'when', 'was', 'going', 'bed', 'always', 'ended', 'gentle', 'admonishment', 'daughters', 'not', 'stay', 'up', 'too', 'late', 'gently', 'humourous', 'also', 'father', '8217', 'undemonstrative', 'affection', 'girls.Vickery', 'Turner', 'once', 'married', 'great', 'Warren', 'Oates', 'particularly', 'good', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'who', 'outlived', 'siblings', 'nearest', 'finding', 'happiness', 'short', 'life', 'Brontes', 'were', 'tragic', 'family', 'was', 'not', 'uncommon', 'time', 'people', 'die', 'young.This', 'low-key', 'compelling', 'drama', 'produced', 'performed', 'sure', 'hand', 'Lovers', 'Brontean', 'literature', 'will', 'revel', 'details', 'lives', 'family', 'artists', 'dampness', 'life', 'next', 'wind-swept', 'moor', 'well-created', 'lovingly', 'brought', 'screen.Barbara', 'Leigh-Hunt', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'not', 'nearly', 'known', 'well', 'enough', 'North', 'America', '8217', 's', 'contemporary', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'narrative', 'together', 'playing', 'historically-true', 'Bronte', 'biographer', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'narrating', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'appearing', 'last.It', 'well-known', 'historical', 'fact', 'Bronte', 'children', 'died', 'young', 'last', 'scene', 'father', 'Bronte', 'sitting', 'alone', 'fire', 'wearing', 'always', 'high', 'preferred', '8220', 'Wellington', '8221', '-style', 'collar', 'short', 'soliloquy', 'why', 'life', 'unfolded', 'why', 'lost', 'children', 'deeply', 'poetic', 'beautiful', 'tragic', 'as', 'haunting', 'great', 'words', 'woven', 'together', 'trio', 'tragic', 'sisters', 'genius', 'Christopher', 'Fry', 'finding', 'right', 'words', 'end', 'history', 'more', 'questions', 'can', 'answer.THE', 'BRONTES', 'OF', 'HAWORTH', 'fine', 'intelligent', 'biographical', 'drama']",N/A

550064,A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,B00004T3AB,"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[14, 14]","I've loved the story of the Bronte family ever since I read Jane Eyre at age eleven and have since read everything I could about this unusual, talented family.  This production follows closely the facts of their lives as I have understood them though the first half especially focuses so much on Branwell that Charlotte, Emily and Anne fall in to the background. As another reviewer wrote Charlotte's time in Belgium could have been expanded especially since it so heavily influenced her writing in both Jane Eyre and Villette.  One of the high points of the film is the  actresses playing the girls are made up and portray themselves so they closely match the famous portrait Branwell painted of the trio.  I loved the little things that were brought out - fiercely intelligent Charlotte so nearsighted that without her spectacles she has to almost put her face to the print as she reads and writes, brilliant eccentric Emily who rises from her death bed to feed the dogs and sweet Anne perhaps the least gifted but the one most likely to have led  a conventional life if only circumstances had been different.  The actor playing Branwell does a good job as he falls from the bright shining hope of the family to crazed recluse destined to be the first Bronte to die young.  We are never sure if it was drink, drugs, depression or just failure to meet his dreams that turned him in to a decrepit heap rarely rising from his bed.  Rev. Bronte is portrayed as almost unbelievably passive as he takes the self destruction of his son and the later deaths of his daughters stoically.  The only thing that ever really upsets him is when Charlotte's future husband, Arthur, first begins to show a romantic interest in her.  Yet after Charlotte's death Arthur is the only one left to care for the old man so he deigns to considers him a ""son"".  But as Rev. Bronte says himself in the final scene he is ""eccentric"".  I do think that many viewers who do not know the story of the Brontes will find this production to be confusing, boring and ultimately depressing but this Bronte lover at least was thrilled to find the Brontes and their parsonage and Yorkshire moors acted out on the small screen.",5,Great for Bronte lovers but perhaps a bit of a bore for others,1157760000,"09 9, 2006",2006,2189,"[""'ve"", 'loved', 'story', 'Bronte', 'family', 'ever', 'read', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'age', 'eleven', 'have', 'read', 'everything', 'could', 'about', 'unusual', 'talented', 'family', 'production', 'closely', 'facts', 'lives', 'have', 'understood', 'first', 'half', 'especially', 'so', 'much', 'Branwell', 'Charlotte', 'Emily', 'Anne', 'fall', 'background', 'reviewer', 'wrote', 'Charlotte', 'time', 'Belgium', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'expanded', 'especially', 'so', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'writing', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Villette', 'One', 'high', 'points', 'film', 'actresses', 'playing', 'girls', 'are', 'made', 'up', 'portray', 'so', 'closely', 'match', 'famous', 'portrait', 'Branwell', 'painted', 'trio', 'loved', 'little', 'things', 'were', 'brought', 'out', 'fiercely', 'intelligent', 'Charlotte', 'so', 'nearsighted', 'spectacles', 'almost', 'put', 'face', 'print', 'brilliant', 'eccentric', 'Emily', 'who', 'death', 'bed', 'feed', 'dogs', 'sweet', 'Anne', 'perhaps', 'least', 'gifted', 'one', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'led', 'conventional', 'life', 'only', 'circumstances', 'had', 'been', 'different', 'actor', 'playing', 'Branwell', 'good', 'job', 'bright', 'shining', 'hope', 'family', 'crazed', 'recluse', 'destined', 'be', 'first', 'Bronte', 'die', 'young', 'are', 'never', 'sure', 'was', 'drink', 'drugs', 'depression', 'just', 'failure', 'meet', 'dreams', 'turned', 'decrepit', 'heap', 'rarely', 'rising', 'bed', 'Rev', 'Bronte', 'portrayed', 'almost', 'unbelievably', 'passive', 'self', 'destruction', 'son', 'later', 'deaths', 'daughters', 'stoically', 'only', 'thing', 'ever', 'really', 'upsets', 'when', 'Charlotte', 'future', 'husband', 'Arthur', 'first', 'show', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Charlotte', 'death', 'Arthur', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'care', 'old', 'man', 'considers', 'son', 'Rev', 'Bronte', 'final', 'scene', 'eccentric', 'do', 'think', 'many', 'viewers', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'story', 'Brontes', 'will', 'find', 'production', 'be', 'confusing', 'boring', 'ultimately', 'depressing', 'Bronte', 'lover', 'least', 'was', 'thrilled', 'find', 'Brontes', 'parsonage', 'Yorkshire', 'moors', 'acted', 'out', 'small', 'screen']",N/A

Personally I felt there was too much focus on Branwell initially and the production could also have delved deeper into Charlotte's experiences abroad.All the actors did a great job in their roles - the viewer gets the sense that these are the actual people, so credibly are they portrayed.
