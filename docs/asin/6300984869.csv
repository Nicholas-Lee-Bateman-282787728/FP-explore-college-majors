240982,A2T74RP19O2K4Q,6300984869,Ben,"[3, 3]","so says Lillian Gish to Bette Davis.  And, at this point, Davis is so exhausted and ravaged that she accepts the verdict.  This line, after her stroke, after her cancer, after her diabolical daughters' book, could not have been easy to hear.  Or act.But, stoically, she does.  It's a stunning moment and everyone who knew anything knew what Gish was saying and what Davis must have been feeling.Gish and Davis are sisters in a timeless cottage (I say ""timeless"" as we never really figure out when this movie is supposed to take place until a car shows up in the driveway; late 40's or so).  Davis is blind and cantankerous and Gish is all tea and honey.I, for one, would LOVE to live in this house.  It's beautiful.  Old.  New.  Fancy.  Plain.  Just some house where two old ladies live.  A beautiful house (small) on the coast of Maine.  The scenery is gorgeous.  Like really gorgeous.Not much happens in the film.  Which, depending on your take of things, is either good or awful.  Vincent Price plays some sort of homeless, devil-may-care Russian emigre and Ann Sothern, as a neighbor, are perfectly fine.  Though Sothern's attempt at a ""Maine/New England"" accent are too pronounced.  (She's the only one in the film who tries out an accent and has the audacity to stick with it).The handyman also has an accent and he's loud and obnoxious but he's putting in the picture window which, for some reason, is pivotal to the plot.  I say ""for some reason"" as Davis, like I've said, is blind and what the hell would she care about a picture window?  (But her scene where she reaches for the blueberries is wonderful).The cast is so chock full of old pros that there is no way that this can be a bad film.  You feel the frustration of both actresses as they play out their lives together.  Gish is understanding personified, if fretful and worried over her sister, and Davis is just as kind, if not misguided, in her sometimes harsh treatment of those around her.You want to hug both of them.  And you will want to spend an afternoon with them.",4,"""And you were never a very good mother....""",1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,2041,"['so', 'Lillian', 'Gish', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'point', 'Davis', 'so', 'exhausted', 'ravaged', 'verdict', 'line', 'stroke', 'cancer', 'diabolical', 'daughters', 'book', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'hear', 'act.But', 'stoically', 'stunning', 'moment', 'everyone', 'who', 'knew', 'anything', 'knew', 'what', 'Gish', 'was', 'saying', 'what', 'Davis', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'feeling.Gish', 'Davis', 'are', 'sisters', 'timeless', 'cottage', 'say', 'timeless', 'never', 'really', 'figure', 'out', 'when', 'movie', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'car', 'up', 'driveway', 'late', '40', 'so', 'Davis', 'blind', 'cantankerous', 'Gish', 'tea', 'honey.I', 'one', 'would', 'LOVE', 'live', 'house', 'beautiful', 'Old', 'New', 'Fancy', 'Plain', 'Just', 'house', 'where', 'two', 'old', 'ladies', 'live', 'beautiful', 'house', 'small', 'coast', 'Maine', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'really', 'gorgeous.Not', 'much', 'happens', 'film', 'Which', 'depending', 'take', 'things', 'either', 'good', 'awful', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'sort', 'homeless', 'devil-may-care', 'Russian', 'emigre', 'Ann', 'Sothern', 'neighbor', 'are', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'Sothern', 'attempt', 'Maine/New', 'England', 'accent', 'are', 'too', 'pronounced', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'who', 'out', 'accent', 'audacity', 'stick', 'handyman', 'also', 'accent', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'putting', 'picture', 'window', 'reason', 'pivotal', 'plot', 'say', 'reason', 'Davis', ""'ve"", 'said', 'blind', 'what', 'hell', 'would', 'care', 'picture', 'window', 'scene', 'where', 'blueberries', 'wonderful', '.The', 'cast', 'so', 'chock', 'full', 'old', 'pros', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'bad', 'film', 'feel', 'frustration', 'actresses', 'play', 'out', 'lives', 'together', 'Gish', 'understanding', 'personified', 'fretful', 'worried', 'sister', 'Davis', 'just', 'kind', 'not', 'misguided', 'sometimes', 'harsh', 'treatment', 'her.You', 'want', 'hug', 'will', 'want', 'spend', 'afternoon']",The Whales of August VHS

240984,A3FLDKR3BBTGB1,6300984869,Brock Stevens,"[3, 3]","WOW, is they only word that comes to mind when thinking of this powerful and elegant drama. The fact that this was Ms. Davis's last (completed) film would be reason enough to buy this movie, it's a story of life and growing older, and they just don't make them like this anymore. Ms. Davis plays ""Libby Strong"", an elderly blind woman, who lives and is cared for by her sister ""Sarah"", played by Ms. Lillian Gish. The film hits on many angles of life love, passion, friendship and the acknowledgement of the inevitable fate that Leers ahead of us all 'death'. Also starring in this magnificent song of truth is Mr. Vincent Price, Ms. Ann Sothern, and the allways witty Harey Carey Jr. I must warn you though, there are no whales in the picture. However, don't let the title, and the fact of there being no whales steer you away from this elegant film. If you're a fan of ""On Golden Pond"", ""Right of Way"", and ""Summer Solstice"", than this is your 'cup of tea'. I know it's a little pricey since it went out of print (I was very fortunate to get it while it was quite cheap), but treat yourself you deserve it, expeirnce the magic of ""The Whales of August"".(As for my statement early in the review of this being Ms. Davis's last competed film, let me elaborate. Ms. Davis did start work on a film titled ""Wicked Stepmother"" in 1989, but to cenima's great loss Ms. Davis passed away before completion of the film.

240991,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,6300984869,David Bower,"[2, 2]","This movie is a treasure chest of small silver coins being cast before the viewer's eyes by this tender and gracious film experience. Silver coins are discovered everywhere as the viewer follows the experiences of two very elderly sisters played by Bette Davis and Lillian Gish, who live in an old house scenically overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and wait each August for the return of the whales.Silver coins are found in the form of marvelous acting, sensitivity for the scenic coastline, the play of the wind on the water, the beauty of flowers, rock and sea, and the remarkable acting skills exhibited by this team of seasoned actors. This movie is a tour-de-force of acting and understated drama. The sisters are joined by two local friends played by Vincent Price and Ann Southern as well as by a local handyman played by Harry Carey Jr. This by any account would be reckoned as a stellar cast and they live up to all expectations as their little dramas of life unfold. The movie shows a wonderful sensitivity to the beauties of that rocky coastline and dedicates precious moments to rejoicing in the quite, still beauty of the scene.One of the touching scenes takes place in the evening when Mr. Maranov, played by Vincent Price, and Mrs. Webber, played by Lillian Gish are admiring the beauty of the moon over the water and Mr. Maranov comments on ""how the moon casts its silver coins along the shore; there is a treasure that can never be spent"" as they watch the reflection of the moon on the water below. This is a lovely and touching scene and captures the spirit of the entire movie; a spirit of tenderness and reflection on life.I found this movie to be a very special experience and highly recommend it for those who can enjoy beauty and subtlety. It is one of those movies that will withstand repeated viewings and is definitely suitable for the entire family.

Two giants: Lillian Gish (as Sarah Weber) and Bette Davis (as Libby Strong), together, for the first and only time! Throw in an excellent performance by Vincent Price (as Baron Nikolai Maranov, clearly a Romanov-based character) and ... WOW! It was every bit worth its wait, and I think this film holds a record for clips being aired on tv during the 'hype' phase.Gish and Davis play sisters from Maine, Gish very elderly and Davis blind. Both are widows, and live a relatively happy existence on the cape (or, rather, on a tiny island just off the cape which I think was filmed in Rhode Island). Gish is a gentle, wonderful presence the likes of which you never see; Davis is as sharp and tart as ever. Beautiful and brilliant!The story is a simple one, set sometime in the 1950s, about what ""the rest of your life"" means when you're so very aged, and what the future may hold. Indeed, at a crucial point Davis dreams of Death calling to her and her sister. She tells her sister, and Gish snaps back at her, ""You can choose death if you like!""The texture, the calm and the colors are incomparable. The locale is stunning - I often said how I would have loved to have a summer place there, wherever it is. The appearance of Vincent Price as an expatriate Russian baron is incredible - and quite realistic. The two scenes I cherish are the one in which he shows a photo of his mother at the Winter Palace; the other, when Baron Maranov shows the ladies a large emerald his mother gave him, the last of the family jewels which he will have to sell in order to live.I also liked the mystery about the era, which took until the end of the film to reveal (we thought they were contemporary). It means the sisters are products of the 19th century, like my sainted grandmother. Sarah especially reminded me very much of my grandmother.This film is an absolute classic, a must-have, and I'd almost be tempted to accuse anyone who hasn't heard of it of being a blockhead. If you thoughtOn Golden Pond (Special Edition)was so great, this film will knock your socks off in that stylish, quiet way that films just can't seem to manage anymore.Davis, Gish and Price!

Menta, Jr.","[1, 1]","During the last ten years or so of her career, the great Bette Davis was pretty much reduced to glorified cameo appearances: a production would hire her to play the family matron, a great aunt, or a similar role that would- by virtue of Ms. Davis' participation- add a certain pedigree to the film in question but in reality not give the actress very much to do (examples include ""The Watcher in the Woods"" and the TV film ""Murder With Mirrors"").  So, even though ""The Whales of August"" isn't a truly great film, it's certainly a good one, and it's certainly great to see Bette Davis go to work and carry a movie, just like in the old days.To be sure, there are other notable performances in ""The Whales of August"": we get to see Vincent Price during one of the rare times we was asked to perform in an understated fashion, and he does a nice job; and we're treated to a rare late-career performance by the great Lillian Gish, whose career stretched back to the films of D.W.

241000,A2XRZV63X79YSJ,6300984869,"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector""","[2, 3]","This film features four great actors who all were stars in the past but at the end of their careers and lives.Lilian Gish (1893-1993) was a pioneer of silent films (80 films in 20 years!) but virtually disappeared with the advent of sound.  She was selective of her films during the next 40 years (only 14).  But when she was in her late 80's there was a resergence in her career with choice featured roles but at 95 she tackled her last role (and a starring role) in The Whales of August.  She was Sarah Webber, one of two fierce sisters hanging on to her dignity and spending her final years in a summer cottage on the coast of Maine with her blind sister.Bette Davis (1908-1989) is considered on of the greatest movie stars of all time.  Bette was a true product of the old Hollywood system.  She worked her way from featured roles and the female interest roles to strong proud leading roles and became Warner Brothers biggest female star.  She, like Kate Hepburn, would be told that her career was over but she would find the role to relaunch it (All About Eve and Baby Jane.)  Not even a stroke kept her down.  The Whales of August was one of her post stroke films.  Some people might say that she looked terrible in the film but considering her stroke, she looked fantastic.  In the film she plays the Sarah's blind sister, Libby Strong.  Libby is estranged from her daughter and is dependant on her oldre sister - to the point she tries to drive away anyone who might come between them. (This was Bette's final completed film as she passed away while filming The Wicked Stepmother.)Vincent Price (1911-1993) was the quintessential featured actor.  He never made leading man status until he starred in a series of horror films in the late 50's to early 70's and was the orginal host of PBS' Mystery anthology series during the 1980's.  And of course was the Voice of the Rap on the Michael Jackson video Thriller.  Vincent would only make 4 films after this film (only Edward Scissorhands was noteable.)  In The Whales of August, Price played Mr. Maranov a Russian emigre that has befriended the sisters.  In a deeper look, Mr. Maranov represents death - as warm inviting friend rather than a figure of doom.Ann Southern (1909-2001) usually played supporting characters in large films and lead roles in second feature films.  She starred in a series of Maisey films from 1939 to 1947.  But she became one of televisions first big stars with her self titled show.  In The Whales of August, Ann played Trisha Dougherty, the sister's best friend (or at least best living friend.)  Ann received her only Oscar Nomination for this film (her final film). (By the way in the opening scene, young Trisha is played by Ann Southern's real daughter.)The film is based on a play by David Berry but was beautifully opened up by the great British director Lindsay Anderson (This Sporting Life).  This also would be one of his last films.This was a film that should have received better Oscar consideration as all four stars should have received nominations.

241003,A1MWZCZGTE79DT,6300984869,Rod Labbe,"[15, 16]","I originally saw ""The Whales of August"" in early 1988 and was struck by its quiet beauty and the very realstic relationship between the two sisters, Libby (Bette Davis) and Sarah (Lillian Gish). Now, almost 20 years later, ""Whales"" is all the more poignant since four of its leads--David, Gish, Vincent Price (charming and still so suave) and Ann Sothern (nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar)--have left us. The story is simple: it begins in the early 20th century (we're left to wonder exactly when) as young Libby, Tish (played first by Sothern's real life daughter, Tisha Sterling, and then by Sothern herself), and Sarah welcome the whales' annual August visit to the Maine coast. Then, what was once sepia becomes blazing color, and we're now in the ""present"" (again, we're unsure exactly when. Libby listens to a snippet of Arthur Godfrey on the radio, and there's mention of Eleanor Roosevelt. Could it be the late 40's/early 50's?). Libby and Sarah are living together, still in the rustic Maine cliff house, and their relationship is clearly established from the get-go. Sarah is ""busy, busy, busy,"" enjoying life for all it still offers. Libby, now blind, has obviously had a stroke and rails at the ""unfairness"" of life. Both are comforted by Memory, and in two separate scenes, Davis and Gish really show us what subtle screen acting is all about. Alone in her bedroom, Libby takes a keepsake lock of her late husband's hair and slowly caresses her face with it (I challenge you to keep a dry eye as you watch this). Later, Sarah celebrates her wedding anniversary with a photo of her soldier husband, Philip, and toasts his philsophy of ""passion and truth."" It's a touching moment and couldn't have been played more effectively.Vincent Price is completely charming as a Russian gentleman down on his luck, and Ann Sothern is a delightful revelation. But The Whales of August belongs to Bette and Lillian. I must admit, I was rather shocked to see how ""Miss D"" had aged (this was her first film after experiencing a real-life stroke), but there's a solid beauty to her ravaged features. This woman has LIVED, and what we're seeing is as strong and enduring as the Maine coastline.MGM has outdone itself with the lovely DVD transfer, but the lack of extras left me a bit flat. Nonetheless, I'm happy to add this to my growing collection.Sadly, we'll never see the likes of Davis, Gish, or Price again. I'm happy I had the opportunity to enjoy all three in their later prime (I'm 53). Gee, I was practically raised on Vincent Price horror films! And Bette scared the pants off me in ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" and ""The Nanny.""

241004,AAOF195P95ZVC,6300984869,Ross E. Nelson,"[25, 26]","Forget the Amazon editorial review of this movie.  ""Fatally soppy"" indeed.  There's nothing maudlin here at all.  This is a perfectly observed movie by several giants of the movie screen: Bette Davis, Lillian Gish, and Vincent Price at their finest, with outstanding back-up by Ann Sothern and Harry Carey, Jr.  It is a moving, melancholy, sometimes almost elegiac look at two elderly sisters in their picturesque Maine cottage, dealing with memories and mortality.  The movie takes place over the space of one day, in the 1950s.Bette Davis is Libby, the caustic blind sister who seems to thrive on bitterness and offending others.  But she is also quite astute and, in the end, is the one holding out hope to see the whales of August, to see that change can be good even near the end of a long life.Gish is the kind, long-suffering sister who owns the cottage, and is a widow like her sibling.  She dearly misses her husband, dead for many decades, and wonders what to do with her irritable sister.The sisters are visited by Tisha (Ann Sothern), the island gossiper and spark plug who is also beginning to really feel her age (she has just had her driver's license suspended).  Also visiting is the courtly Maranov (Vincent Price), a refugee from imperial Russia who has lived off his mother's jewels and with friends all his life.  A sport fisherman, he brings his catch to a dinner with the sisters, with Libby rebuffing him out loud for angling for more than just a meal.There are frequent, peaceful scenery shots of the house and property, and of the sere yet beautiful cove and shoreline nearby.  And always the gentle clanging of an old buoy in the cove, the same one that was there when the sisters were young and spry, and the whales came by every August.  Handyman Harry Carey, Jr. is the one fly in the ointment.  While injecting a perhaps useful counterpoint of noise and gruffness to this gentle movie, not to mention a bit of lament about how times are changing (tourists with their autos have discovered the island), he is quite profane.  The movie didn't need this jarring quality, but I suppose a reputation as a ""G""-type movie (my VHS is unrated) would be considered the kiss of death to adult viewers and yet this subtle a movie too boring for kids.Such an extraordinary and rich story this movie enfolds.  The contrast of youth and age; the way life ""fools"" us (a constant refrain with Libby); the sorrow of a long life and yet the promise of good things worth living for, and the perfect photography which precisely complements the movie's moods.  This is superb filmmaking and acting.  Understated but clear, this show will haunt your quiet moments.  The older you get, the more you'll understand it.Early in the movie Sarah asks Libby, who seems more irritable than usual, if something's wrong.  ""I'm all right,"" Libby replies in a way that the viewer finds out can be taken two ways, ""just a touch of November in my bones.""  But there's always hope that a memento of their youth, the passage of the whales every August, will be there in their dotage.This was the last or one of the last movies the principals in it made.

Sarah still celebrates her wedding anniversary to a man who died in the war over 40 years ago. Miss Gish's sincerity of the character comes through and warms us all. She had been in a total of 103 films in her career.Bette Davis, in her second from the last film role, makes a major hit as Libby, the cantankerous sister that rages at the world,  impending death, and her estrangement with her daughter. She also had 103 films to her credit.Vincent Price is marvelous as Mr. Maranov, an elderly man alone who was related to the Romanov's of Russia. How tender his portrayal is, so genuine! Mr. Price died in 1993, some say of a broken heart because of the passing of his wife, Coral Brown.And how cute was Ann Sothern in the role of Tisha, the two women's life-long friend!  This was also Miss Sothern's last role, though she didn't pass away until 2001.Harry Carey, who played Joshua Brackett, the handy man, is the only surviving major memeber of this cast. You might remember him from the John Wayne film ""Three Godfather's"". He is still active. On IMDb.com I noticed his most current film was this year.

241007,A1SJTURU8I5XYE,6300984869,shebuela,"[3, 15]","My favorite part of the movie was the scenery and the inside of the cottage. It was so quaint. I thought that Lillian Gish did an amazing acting performance. Bette Davis seemed too overly dramatic in her style. She just drew out her words in an odd way. There was one scene where she sat in a chair by the window and then looked out. A blind person would not look out the window. She came out of her room in a gorgeous dress that had small buttons all the way up the back, and I wondered how she could have ever buttoned them. (Maybe, I'm over-analytical) I loved Vincent Price. Wow, he is still appealing even in his later years! Great acting. I didn't care for Ann Sothern. Something about her seemed contrived...maybe it was the accent that just didn't seem natural to her.The movie is basically the relationship between two elderly sisters who live in a house by the sea. That came across pretty realistically, but there was no real plot. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did. Just people dropping in and drinking tea, people puttering around the yard, people going for short walks, ordinary things like that...not too exciting. The older sister started showing signs of senility, and I found that depressing. I also was angry at her for her manipulative behavior and her ingratitude for all that her sister was doing for her.They mentioned the whales throughout the film and it almost seemed like one of the focal points, but then we never saw them and it seemed disappointing to me.  The ending was not a climax; it was uneventful.

241008,A1HSB65494KVFU,6300984869,singapore51,"[6, 7]","Was not aware of this film (or the play) before stumbling across it at a rental shop. Both my girlfriend and I are residents of, and share passionate interests in, the New England coast. With her away in Europe on holiday, I rented this in hopes of coastal scenery that would allow me to dwell on our mutual interests. I received a stunning visual treat and so much more. A very delicate play, filmed against a very bold, delicious scenery, with sensational performances. Yes, it's tempo is slow, and as Bette Davis' character, Libby, states, ""I feel November in my bones"" although it is clearly August by the calendar's gauge, the story indicates the struggle of a half full, or half empty glass, as time draws life closer to it's end. The richness of now, and the treasures of yesterday are examined in such simple, yet handsomely illustrated parallels.If you are a fan of Bette Davis, you will be thrilled by a bravo performance of a bittered soul, envious of her sisters still thriving passion for life. I knew of, but had never seen Lillian Gish. I was mesmerized, enchanted and deeply touched by her stunning portrayal of Sarah, who states defiantly to her sister, ""I am nowhere near ready for my life to be over."" Sarah has the ability to remain reverent to the past, kissing her long deceased husbands picture every day while dusting, and thrive on the new days glory, and her hopes for future whale sightings and dreams of a picture window with which to enjoy dinner by moonlight. A difficulty in marking the time setting of the story was my only nagging question. At one point someone comments of the number of cars appearing lately on ""the island"" (off Maine's rocky coast) as being ""more than Eleanor Roosevelt has causes."" Which prompts the handyman to comment ""seems a bit follish since ya can't drive a mile in any direction before ya fall into the ocean!"" One assumes it is set in the early 50's. There are so many lines so worthy of note, so many poignant scenes, enriching character studies, and breathtaking visuals, that this tender little screen adaptation, is a rainy evening well spent.

It is one of those films were to ""get it"" you have to really listen to the actors and their body language. Lillian Gish is perfect as Sarah an elderly lady who isn't ready to give up on life and still has things to look forward to and that she wants- like a picture window to look out at the moonlight. Bette Davis is amazing as Libby Sarah's blind sister who is very bitter and just wants to get life over with. But at times she is also very shrewd and poignant- a complex woman. Ann Sothern and Vincent Price are good supporting parts as a busybody neighbor and an elderly would be suitor. Harry Carey Jr is great as a handyman who comes over and always makes a lot of noise. I think you have to be an adult to enjoy this movie and get what it is about- living life and not giving up that just because you are elderly doesn't mean your time is gone- that it is gone only when you die. The film belongs to Bette Davis. It is all the more poignant because she was most likely dying of cancer while making this movie and to see her do such excellent acting a year before she died shows what we have lost. The scene that to me stands out is when Ms. Davis says, "" We have such little time left."" It doesn't get more poignant then that. You see in Ms. Davis a woman who has really lived.

She is wise and graceful, firm yet fair in her dealings with those around her and, especially, her difficult sister (Bette Davis). The story is of two sisters who have lived long and full lives now dealing with the realities of their advanced years and the remembrances of their long ago childhood spent in the very house on Cape Cod where Ms. Gish now lives. The dynamics between Gish and Davis reflects very real people. It is at times very tender and at times very tense. Yes, sisters yet very different human beings.Vincent Price plays the older version of the part he played in 'Lauara.' He plays the sincere lady's man who has fallen on hard times, worn around the edges but one who can still charm the ladies.The scenery is stunning. In fact, you can watch it for only the visuals.
