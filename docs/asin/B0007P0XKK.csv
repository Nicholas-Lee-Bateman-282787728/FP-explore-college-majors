885656,A1ZYA1450LWBXF,B0007P0XKK,Amazon Customer,"[9, 11]","If I could sum up what I think is wrong with this DVD, I would say this: If you want substance-look elsewhere.If the pretty and saucy Jayna teaches you anything on this video, it's an attitude. If you want to add a bit of flirtation to your dancing, the mischievous glances, slow sensual movements and sinuous arm movements will work.In a sense, this DVD is for beginners because it takes up a handful of the basic isolations like hip circles, shoulder rolls, undulations, chest circle etc and sets them to a bit of arm styling. Nothing more complicated than that.On the other hand, it couldn't be for absolute beginners because the basic isolations aren't taught in enough detail. They could have been-a few minutes on each of the few taken up here could have done the job. But without going into further depth for these isolations, the movements will not be clean and precise.Perhaps it's okay as first slow gentle choreography after learning the basic isolations elsewhere.I agree with the other reviewers when they say it's a thoroughly enjoyable DVD-specially with Jayna being amusingly flirty through the whole thing. But hey, you've got to balance all that with some solid content. And that... is sadly missing.A particularly rotten trick the makers of this DVD play on you is that they fill the whole thing with repeated stuff. If it weren't enough that the handful of moves are repeated in the instruction itself, there's a whole repat with the narration switched off-lips moving, nothing hearing. Just the music's on for you to apparently dance. What do you do when she spends long moments moving her lips at you? It was most unnecessary to dump this repeat on the DVD to make it look nice and filled up. One can turn off the volume and put on some other music, after all, and get much the same effect.Then there's a ""bonus"" workout (the arrogance!) that repeats the same isolations in another sequence! It really doesn't give you anything additional. If the USP of this video is supposed to be the use of glances and arm styling, let me tell you there's about 3 glances and 5 or 6 arm positions. You could have seen them in photographs. Oh, there's another section of photographs which again, are taken out of the video footage. And finally, you're the lucky recipient of a whole stack of trailers of other DVDs for what's probably more of the same trick.I can't help comparing this video with Neon's Instant Belly Dancer series where she gives you at least 30 isolations on each video, with dozens and dozens of combinations, turning each of the isolations into some usable step. It's packed with content. If you were to stop and actually count the hand and arm positions, there'll be dozens of them.Jayna's DVD is a flirtation with belly dancing that isn't worth the money or the wait that some of us overseas have to go through. If it weren't so cumbersome, I'd return it in a flash.Watch out for DVDs from this manufacturer. I had the misfortune of buying another one-10-minute dance workouts-and surprise surprise, Jayna's ""bonus"" workout was there as well. Along with all the trailers AGAIN.What Jayna does teach you is how simple it is to make just an isolation look like a dance move, and how you could have a go at using glances in dances. Her two friends, I'm afraid, don't quite manage it and end up looking a bit tense throughout. Jayna's own technique seems kind of amateurish-that's to a beginner belly dancer!",2,Fluffy and flirtatious--but not much else,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,3435,"['could', 'sum', 'up', 'what', 'think', 'wrong', 'DVD', 'would', 'say', 'want', 'substance-look', 'pretty', 'saucy', 'Jayna', 'teaches', 'anything', 'video', 'attitude', 'want', 'add', 'bit', 'flirtation', 'dancing', 'mischievous', 'glances', 'slow', 'sensual', 'movements', 'sinuous', 'arm', 'movements', 'will', 'work.In', 'sense', 'DVD', 'beginners', 'up', 'handful', 'basic', 'isolations', 'hip', 'circles', 'shoulder', 'rolls', 'undulations', 'chest', 'circle', 'etc', 'bit', 'arm', 'styling', 'Nothing', 'more', 'complicated', 'that.On', 'other', 'hand', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'absolute', 'beginners', 'basic', 'isolations', 'are', ""n't"", 'taught', 'enough', 'detail', 'could', 'have', 'been-a', 'few', 'minutes', 'few', 'taken', 'up', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'job', 'going', 'further', 'depth', 'isolations', 'movements', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'clean', 'first', 'slow', 'gentle', 'choreography', 'learning', 'basic', 'isolations', 'elsewhere.I', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'when', 'say', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'DVD-specially', 'Jayna', 'being', 'amusingly', 'flirty', 'whole', 'thing', 'hey', ""'ve"", 'got', 'balance', 'solid', 'content', 'sadly', 'missing.A', 'particularly', 'rotten', 'trick', 'makers', 'DVD', 'play', 'fill', 'whole', 'thing', 'repeated', 'stuff', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'handful', 'moves', 'are', 'repeated', 'instruction', 'whole', 'repat', 'narration', 'switched', 'off-lips', 'moving', 'nothing', 'hearing', 'Just', 'music', 'apparently', 'dance', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'when', 'long', 'moments', 'moving', 'lips', 'was', 'most', 'unnecessary', 'dump', 'repeat', 'DVD', 'make', 'look', 'nice', 'filled', 'up', 'One', 'can', 'turn', 'off', 'volume', 'put', 'other', 'music', 'get', 'much', 'same', 'effect.Then', 'bonus', 'workout', 'arrogance', 'same', 'isolations', 'sequence', 'really', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'additional', 'USP', 'video', 'supposed', 'be', 'use', 'glances', 'arm', 'styling', 'let', 'tell', '3', 'glances', '5', '6', 'arm', 'positions', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'photographs', 'Oh', 'section', 'photographs', 'again', 'are', 'taken', 'video', 'footage', 'finally', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'recipient', 'whole', 'stack', 'trailers', 'other', 'DVDs', 'what', 'probably', 'more', 'same', 'trick.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'comparing', 'video', 'Neon', 'Instant', 'Belly', 'Dancer', 'series', 'where', 'least', '30', 'isolations', 'video', 'dozens', 'dozens', 'combinations', 'turning', 'isolations', 'usable', 'step', 'packed', 'content', 'were', 'stop', 'actually', 'count', 'hand', 'arm', 'positions', ""'ll"", 'be', 'dozens', 'them.Jayna', 'DVD', 'flirtation', 'belly', 'dancing', ""n't"", 'worth', 'money', 'wait', 'have', 'go', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'cumbersome', ""'d"", 'return', 'flash.Watch', 'out', 'DVDs', 'manufacturer', 'had', 'misfortune', 'buying', 'one-10-minute', 'dance', 'workouts-and', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'Jayna', 'bonus', 'workout', 'was', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'trailers', 'AGAIN.What', 'Jayna', 'teach', 'how', 'simple', 'make', 'just', 'isolation', 'look', 'dance', 'move', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'go', 'using', 'glances', 'dances', 'two', 'friends', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'manage', 'end', 'up', 'looking', 'bit', 'tense', 'Jayna', 'own', 'technique', 'kind', 'amateurish-that', 'beginner', 'belly']",N/A

I found myself enjoying the challenge of deciphering Jayna's magic by myself (I mean, I didn't really want more instructions, and for some reason didn't mind replaying short segments over and over, trying to figure out what's going on).The ladies in the background were somewhat clumsy... but it was actually helpful to watch what to avoid.Despite Jayna's happy-go-lucky style of teaching, her performance at the end is very professional and classy, and radiates irresistible personality.If you are looking for sweaty, draining exercises, this disk won't be a good choice for you...

885659,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0007P0XKK,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[27, 27]","This video is led by bellydancer Jayna.  The goal is to teach you more than just bellydance moves per se; the goal is for you to learn how to add sensuality to your bellydance practice.  The DVD is well-chaptered, and the main instructional segment is broken down into several shorter segments, including glances and arms (4.5 minutes), upper body (7.5 minutes), lower body (3 minutes), and travelling steps and turns (13 minutes).  Not surprisingly, the last section is the most complex, as you begin work on more complicated footwork and to combine this with the arms movements.  You then practice all the moves with three very brief (only about 30 seconds) combos with instructors Emily, Donna, and Jayna; each combo is performed once with Jayna giving voiceover direct and then secondly with little instruction.  Following the instructional portion, there is a short group combination dance (1.5 minutes) and a slightly longer solo dance by Jayna.I consider the main part of this video to be more instructional rather than a true workout, especially given that Jayna introduces each new move slowly and there are frequent pauses while she provides additional information.  However, the DVD does include a 10-minute bonus workout.  Here you do a series of basic bellydance moves--eg, chest and hip isolations, hip circles, figure 8s--in a nice flow.  This was at best a gentle workout; Jayna says at one point ""your hips should be burning!"" but mine really weren't, just nicely stretched and opened.  An additional bonus freature on the DVD was trailers from Natural Journey's ""For Wimps"" series as well as their other titles.  Overall, if you are are looking to fine-tune your bellydance practice and become a better dance, these video has plenty of great tips, but if you are hoping for a good bellydance workout, this probablly is not the video for you.",4,An instructional video for adding sensuality to your bellydance practice,1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,1859,"['video', 'led', 'bellydancer', 'Jayna', 'goal', 'teach', 'more', 'just', 'bellydance', 'moves', 'se', 'goal', 'learn', 'how', 'add', 'sensuality', 'bellydance', 'practice', 'DVD', 'well-chaptered', 'main', 'instructional', 'segment', 'broken', 'down', 'several', 'shorter', 'segments', 'including', 'glances', 'arms', '4.5', 'minutes', 'upper', 'body', '7.5', 'minutes', 'lower', 'body', '3', 'minutes', 'travelling', 'steps', 'turns', '13', 'minutes', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'last', 'section', 'most', 'complex', 'begin', 'work', 'more', 'complicated', 'footwork', 'combine', 'arms', 'movements', 'then', 'practice', 'moves', 'three', 'very', 'brief', 'only', 'about', '30', 'seconds', 'combos', 'instructors', 'Emily', 'Donna', 'Jayna', 'combo', 'performed', 'once', 'Jayna', 'giving', 'voiceover', 'direct', 'then', 'secondly', 'little', 'instruction', 'Following', 'instructional', 'portion', 'short', 'group', 'combination', 'dance', '1.5', 'minutes', 'slightly', 'longer', 'solo', 'dance', 'Jayna.I', 'consider', 'main', 'part', 'video', 'be', 'more', 'instructional', 'rather', 'true', 'workout', 'especially', 'given', 'Jayna', 'new', 'move', 'slowly', 'are', 'frequent', 'pauses', 'additional', 'information', 'However', 'DVD', 'include', '10-minute', 'bonus', 'workout', 'Here', 'do', 'series', 'basic', 'bellydance', 'moves', 'eg', 'chest', 'hip', 'isolations', 'hip', 'circles', 'figure', '8s', 'nice', 'flow', 'was', 'best', 'gentle', 'workout', 'Jayna', 'one', 'point', 'hips', 'should', 'be', 'burning', 'mine', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'just', 'nicely', 'stretched', 'opened', 'additional', 'bonus', 'freature', 'DVD', 'was', 'trailers', 'Natural', 'Journey', 'Wimps', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'titles', 'Overall', 'are', 'are', 'looking', 'fine-tune', 'bellydance', 'practice', 'become', 'better', 'dance', 'video', 'plenty', 'great', 'tips', 'are', 'hoping', 'good', 'bellydance', 'workout', 'probablly', 'not', 'video']",N/A

I think most beginning bd students are really looking for a way to look sexy and sensuous like more experienced dancers and this tape allows beginners to get some of it instantly!In terms of content, there is instruction on eye contact, head rolls, posing, hand and arm positioning which all give that sexy, playful look.  I found the instruction on the 3/4 shimmy to be most helpful as, for me, this movement always felt a little goofy on my body. I also adored the two background dancers and their combinations.

She really has great presence & really is great at reminding you to keep eye contact & remind you to stay confident. I immediatly felt a difference. She was great at saying ""Here's your chance to flirt with me.... Flip your hair like you're on fire.... this pose is the 'Aren't I adorable' pose... I'm back, did you miss me?....Don't forget to look at me, you know I hate when I'm ignored....""  She was perfect at being sensual but also sweet & reminding you how important it is to look at who you are dancing for to include them into your dancing & just ENJOY yourself to relieve daily stress instead of just worrying about accuracy.The DVD has nice menus, comes in 5.1 dolby sound & widescreen choice. There are a lot of trailers for the Wimp Series, Raina's bellydance series & Shuilula's BellyDance Fusion Series. The trailers were too short for me though. Except to know not to buy the Wimp series.She teaches with the blue shirt & black pants with a hip scarf you see on the DVD cover to show you don't need an elaborate costume to look great. She has 2 backup female dancers who are danced like office workers as well.She teaches slowly at first then speeds it up. She does everything on both sides. She doesn't give that much cues or help in explaining, though some like her vertical figure 8's I liked.There are basic shoulder roles & bending back with them, shoulder shimmies ""Why do they call it shoulder shimmies when you know no one is looking at your shoulders....?"" Horizontal chest circles, regular horizontal hip circles, & while steping as you do it, wide hip circles with ""shaking your tail"", verticle figure 8s, hip drops with extra bounces to the back, 3/4 shimmies, which Neena & Veena do in a better way without lifting your foot which they use an ""L"" visual how to teach, camels which she teaches well, hip drop walking, shaasze? step, Shinee? turn & another turn. Then she & the background dancers put 3 very, very short routines they do once normal speed, then again slow it down a little to follow along. The entire workout is 30 min including her introduction.The workout was slow, I didn't sweat or feel anything except for doing the camels. It was fun though, the music is at a soft level, sensual, moderate tempo with a good strong beat which felt right for the pace of the DVD & intensity. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone as a first or only bellydance, but as an addition to help you feel more confident & relax & not be afraid to look at your friends, spouse when dancing for them.The extra 10 min bonus routine is only with her with a half-sweat top & tight shirt & workout pants with hip scarf that is of more belydancing with what you were already taught with more chest slides, back/forth, lifts/drops, chest circles, hips circles, vertical & horizonal figure 8s & camels. Her pace is very relaxed & I felt a nice work on my abs with that.I took off a star wishing there was more content instead of more repeating of what you already learned & slow pace. Take off another star if you're looking for more then just learning to be relaxed while doing some slow paced bellydance drills.",4,Delivers what it promises,1116460800,"05 19, 2005",2005,3177,"['Jayna', 'actually', 'very', 'sweet', 'good', 'humor', 'really', 'great', 'presence', 'really', 'great', 'reminding', 'keep', 'eye', 'contact', 'remind', 'stay', 'confident', 'immediatly', 'felt', 'difference', 'was', 'great', 'saying', 'Here', 'chance', 'flirt', 'Flip', 'hair', ""'re"", 'fire', 'pose', ""'Are"", ""n't"", 'adorable', 'pose', ""'m"", 'back', 'did', 'miss', '.Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'look', 'know', 'hate', 'when', ""'m"", 'ignored', 'was', 'perfect', 'being', 'sensual', 'also', 'sweet', 'reminding', 'how', 'important', 'look', 'who', 'are', 'dancing', 'include', 'dancing', 'just', 'ENJOY', 'relieve', 'daily', 'stress', 'instead', 'just', 'worrying', 'accuracy.The', 'DVD', 'nice', 'menus', '5.1', 'dolby', 'sound', 'widescreen', 'choice', 'are', 'lot', 'trailers', 'Wimp', 'Series', 'Raina', 'bellydance', 'series', 'Shuilula', 'BellyDance', 'Fusion', 'Series', 'trailers', 'were', 'too', 'short', 'know', 'not', 'buy', 'Wimp', 'series.She', 'teaches', 'blue', 'shirt', 'black', 'pants', 'hip', 'scarf', 'see', 'DVD', 'cover', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'elaborate', 'costume', 'look', 'great', '2', 'backup', 'female', 'dancers', 'who', 'are', 'danced', 'office', 'workers', 'well.She', 'teaches', 'slowly', 'first', 'then', 'up', 'everything', 'sides', ""n't"", 'give', 'that', 'much', 'cues', 'help', 'explaining', 'vertical', 'figure', '8', 'are', 'basic', 'shoulder', 'roles', 'bending', 'back', 'shoulder', 'shimmies', 'Why', 'do', 'call', 'shoulder', 'shimmies', 'when', 'know', 'one', 'looking', 'shoulders', 'Horizontal', 'chest', 'circles', 'regular', 'horizontal', 'hip', 'circles', 'steping', 'do', 'wide', 'hip', 'circles', 'shaking', 'tail', 'verticle', 'figure', '8s', 'hip', 'drops', 'extra', 'bounces', 'back', '3/4', 'shimmies', 'Neena', 'Veena', 'do', 'better', 'way', 'lifting', 'foot', 'use', 'L', 'visual', 'how', 'teach', 'camels', 'well', 'drop', 'walking', 'shaasze', 'step', 'Shinee', 'turn', 'turn', 'Then', 'background', 'dancers', 'put', '3', 'very', 'very', 'short', 'routines', 'do', 'once', 'normal', 'speed', 'then', 'again', 'slow', 'down', 'little', 'follow', 'along', 'entire', 'workout', '30', 'min', 'including', 'introduction.The', 'workout', 'was', 'slow', 'did', ""n't"", 'sweat', 'feel', 'anything', 'doing', 'camels', 'was', 'fun', 'music', 'soft', 'level', 'sensual', 'moderate', 'tempo', 'good', 'strong', 'beat', 'felt', 'right', 'pace', 'DVD', 'intensity', 'would', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'anyone', 'first', 'only', 'bellydance', 'addition', 'help', 'feel', 'more', 'confident', 'relax', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'look', 'friends', 'spouse', 'when', 'dancing', 'them.The', 'extra', '10', 'min', 'bonus', 'routine', 'only', 'half-sweat', 'top', 'tight', 'shirt', 'workout', 'pants', 'hip', 'scarf', 'more', 'belydancing', 'what', 'were', 'already', 'taught', 'more', 'chest', 'slides', 'back/forth', 'lifts/drops', 'chest', 'circles', 'hips', 'circles', 'vertical', 'horizonal', 'figure', '8s', 'camels', 'pace', 'very', 'relaxed', 'felt', 'nice', 'work', 'abs', 'that.I', 'took', 'off', 'star', 'wishing', 'was', 'more', 'content', 'instead', 'more', 'repeating', 'what', 'already', 'learned', 'slow', 'pace', 'Take', 'off', 'star', ""'re"", 'looking', 'more', 'then', 'just', 'learning', 'be', 'relaxed', 'doing', 'slow', 'paced', 'bellydance', 'drills']",N/A
