Someone had gone to considerable trouble to make sure that the facts were properly checked.I also was quite surprised at the quality of much of the film. I did not realize that so much good film was available. It was well put together too.What I did think is that too much was said about the British experience. I would liked to have seen more on the French, Austro-Hungary and Eastern Fronts in particular Russian and the Austro-Hungary where some of the deadliest fighting of the war took place.  A better discussion of the weapon systems. A better analysis of the tactical problems faced by both sides.I would also have liked more about the killings of Armenians. The situation in Palestinian. Japanese part in the conflict. Not because these are so relevant to the war as such but because of its major impact these events had later.I suppose you could say that I wanted another 4 DVDs in say an expansion pack to this series.Overall you could say that I am recommending this documentary because its the best available not because of its own qualities.

It is very effective. This 2003 series is as if nothing has ever come before it. It takes an extremely fresh approach to tired subjects such as the domino effect of how WW1 started. We see the major characters afresh, and studio actors read their words aloud like a script in the appropriate accents. The segment called ""Jihad"" was obviously crafted to show today's audiences just how history repeats itself, and how today's troubled Middle East arose from the events of WW1.

There's no transition from story to story, it's just a succession of images non-stop. The voices distract from the images and viceversa.

911338,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B0009S2K9C,DarthRad,"[40, 47]","This DVD series has its moments.  There is an excellent beginning that describes the fragile state of the Austro-Hungarian empire and the alliances and ambitions of the European nations that would inexorably drive the world to war as the result of the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand.There are also other excellent pieces, among them: the adventures of Admiral Graf Spee and the several German surface ships that had avoided being bottled up in their home ports, the South African conflict, the Arabs and Lawrence of Arabia, and an explanation of the Armenian massacre.The intent of this series seems to be to focus on those events of WWI that have relevance to the conflicts and controversies of today.  So we see how the British cruelly preyed upon rising Arab nationalism to pry away most of the Middle East away from the Ottoman Empire.  We see how Japan was asked by Britain to attack German interests in China, thus giving it a foothold and a beginning to its later full-scale invasion of China (which would eventually engulf the U.S. at Pearl Harbor).  We see how the futile efforts of the British to track down a wily German adversary in southern Africa ended up devastating large swaths of African native villages.  We see how the modern day conflicts of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia had their starts in the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian empire.  We see how Lenin and the Bolsheviks got started with the Russian Revolution with help from the Germans.All of this is just grand.  But what get lost are the usual centerpiece stories of WWI -  there are only the briefest mentions of major battles such as the Somme, Ypres, Paschendale, barely any mention at all of the dawn of aviation warfare in WWI, only a passing reference to the presence of American soldiers in WWI (portrayed only as obstinately independent and  grossly over-eager to repeat all the same mistakes of the British and French forces).Many of the same shots of battle footage get repeated over and over again.  This obviously makes you wonder just exactly which battles these scenes really came from, and severely discredits the whole series.The old footage also gets interspersed with scenes from modern times.  Presumably these modern scenes are of the battlegrounds being described by the narrator, but frequently there is no commentary at all to explain the significance of these modern scenes.  A farm field!  Great!  Another farm field!  A forest!  Just what the heck are we looking at, I wanted to ask, many times?All in all, a mediocre series that could have been so much better.",3,"Wide breadth of coverage, but hardly comprehensive.",1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,2571,"['DVD', 'series', 'moments', 'excellent', 'beginning', 'fragile', 'state', 'Austro-Hungarian', 'empire', 'alliances', 'ambitions', 'European', 'nations', 'would', 'inexorably', 'drive', 'world', 'war', 'result', 'assassination', 'Archduke', 'Ferdinand.There', 'are', 'also', 'other', 'excellent', 'pieces', 'adventures', 'Admiral', 'Graf', 'Spee', 'several', 'German', 'surface', 'ships', 'had', 'avoided', 'being', 'bottled', 'up', 'home', 'ports', 'South', 'African', 'conflict', 'Arabs', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'explanation', 'Armenian', 'massacre.The', 'intent', 'series', 'be', 'focus', 'events', 'WWI', 'have', 'relevance', 'conflicts', 'controversies', 'today', 'see', 'how', 'British', 'cruelly', 'preyed', 'rising', 'Arab', 'nationalism', 'pry', 'away', 'most', 'Middle', 'East', 'away', 'Ottoman', 'Empire', 'see', 'how', 'Japan', 'was', 'asked', 'Britain', 'attack', 'German', 'interests', 'China', 'thus', 'giving', 'foothold', 'beginning', 'later', 'full-scale', 'invasion', 'China', 'would', 'eventually', 'engulf', 'U.S.', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'see', 'how', 'futile', 'efforts', 'British', 'track', 'down', 'wily', 'German', 'adversary', 'southern', 'Africa', 'ended', 'up', 'devastating', 'large', 'swaths', 'African', 'native', 'villages', 'see', 'how', 'modern', 'day', 'conflicts', 'Serbia', 'Croatia', 'Bosnia', 'had', 'starts', 'breakup', 'Austro-Hungarian', 'empire', 'see', 'how', 'Lenin', 'Bolsheviks', 'got', 'started', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'help', 'Germans.All', 'just', 'grand', 'what', 'get', 'lost', 'are', 'usual', 'centerpiece', 'stories', 'WWI', 'are', 'only', 'briefest', 'mentions', 'major', 'battles', 'such', 'Somme', 'Ypres', 'Paschendale', 'barely', 'mention', 'dawn', 'aviation', 'warfare', 'WWI', 'only', 'passing', 'reference', 'presence', 'American', 'soldiers', 'WWI', 'portrayed', 'only', 'obstinately', 'independent', 'grossly', 'over-eager', 'repeat', 'same', 'mistakes', 'British', 'French', 'forces', '.Many', 'same', 'shots', 'battle', 'footage', 'get', 'repeated', 'over', 'again', 'obviously', 'wonder', 'just', 'exactly', 'scenes', 'really', 'came', 'severely', 'whole', 'series.The', 'old', 'footage', 'also', 'interspersed', 'scenes', 'modern', 'times', 'Presumably', 'modern', 'scenes', 'are', 'battlegrounds', 'being', 'described', 'narrator', 'frequently', 'commentary', 'explain', 'significance', 'modern', 'scenes', 'farm', 'field', 'Great', 'farm', 'field', 'forest', 'Just', 'what', 'heck', 'are', 'looking', 'wanted', 'ask', 'many', 'times', 'mediocre', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better']",N/A

I had heard or read many knowledgeable people refer to the book ""The Guns Of August"" by Barbara Tuchman to be a masterful summary and analysis of the lead up to and the beginning month of the war.  That it contained and wove together information about the major countries, leaders, major players and major events leading up to the start of the war and a very detailed account of the actions contained in the first month (August, 1914) of the war up to the beginning of the Battle of the Marne.So my first step was to purchase and read this book which, upon reading, I thought was very well written, containing very detailed information with regard to the prewar battle plans developed over many years by both the Germans and French, the idea held by both sides that, once the war was inevitable, swift implementation and strict adherence to their respective plans would lead to a great series of battles lasting about a month inevitably leading to a quick submission by the enemy, meaning that the war would last no more than 3-4 months at most.  She also made the point over and over that none of the countries involved believed the war could last longer than a few months owing to the industrial and commercial basis of the economies of all the likely participants.  The book was very detailed concerning the initial invasion of Belgium by Germany and the clash between the French and Germans all along the French-German and German-Belgium & Luxembourg borders, the swing of the German divisions on the right side of their line through Belgium and down through the north of France and the major engagements in East Prussia between the German and Russian troops.After reading the book I then looked for documentaries that would enhance my knowledge learned in the book as well as to get an overview of the entire war, its ending and legacy.  My confusion stems from the fact that in the documentaries I've watched so far, very little corroborates the material in Ms. Tuchman's award winning book.  In the documentaries I've identified so far, they fall into one of two camps, those produced in the 1960s and those produced in the early 2000s.  My initial thought is to rely more heavily on the more recently produced information, thinking that more time has allowed a more accurate analysis due to greater objectivity.  But all of these documentaries seem to be at odds with most of Tuchman's major points, e.g. one documentary makes the point that Germany went to war reluctantly and kind of haphazardly, with no specific plan but with the idea they would have to be flexible based on conditions and the actions of the French army and believing that the war would last for years.  This is totally at odds with Tuchman's book.  Also, Tuchman makes a major point about the fact that in the German battle plan, the Schleifflen(sp) Plan, the critical operation was the placement of the majority of troops creating an overloaded German right side which would swing through Belgium, invade France from the north, come down behind and envelope and trap the French army engaged and held on the German border by the rest of the German army.  None of the documentaries I've watched have even mentioned this critical part of the early actions in August and I've heard no references at all to either the German or French prewar battle plans.I would welcome someone who is familiar with this war and the materials available to learn about it to recommend to me additional books and the best documentaries to get an accurate knowledge of the subject.",2,"The more I Delve Into It, The More Confused I Get",1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,3837,"['decided', 'recently', 'learn', 'more', 'World', 'War', 'Compared', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'Great', 'War', 'regarding', 'causes', 'lead', 'up', 'onset', 'war', 'current', 'states', 'major', 'countries', 'involved', 'how', 'started', 'chronology', 'war', 'how', 'why', 'ended', 'had', 'heard', 'read', 'many', 'knowledgeable', 'people', 'refer', 'book', 'Guns', 'August', 'Barbara', 'Tuchman', 'be', 'masterful', 'summary', 'analysis', 'lead', 'beginning', 'month', 'war', 'contained', 'wove', 'together', 'information', 'major', 'countries', 'leaders', 'major', 'players', 'major', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'start', 'war', 'very', 'detailed', 'account', 'actions', 'contained', 'first', 'month', 'August', '1914', 'war', 'up', 'beginning', 'Battle', 'Marne.So', 'first', 'step', 'was', 'purchase', 'read', 'book', 'reading', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'containing', 'very', 'detailed', 'information', 'regard', 'prewar', 'battle', 'plans', 'developed', 'many', 'years', 'Germans', 'French', 'idea', 'held', 'sides', 'once', 'war', 'was', 'inevitable', 'swift', 'implementation', 'strict', 'adherence', 'respective', 'plans', 'would', 'lead', 'great', 'series', 'battles', 'lasting', 'month', 'inevitably', 'leading', 'quick', 'submission', 'enemy', 'meaning', 'war', 'would', 'last', 'no', 'more', '3-4', 'months', 'most', 'also', 'made', 'point', 'none', 'countries', 'involved', 'believed', 'war', 'could', 'last', 'longer', 'few', 'months', 'owing', 'industrial', 'commercial', 'basis', 'economies', 'likely', 'participants', 'book', 'was', 'very', 'detailed', 'concerning', 'initial', 'invasion', 'Belgium', 'Germany', 'clash', 'French', 'Germans', 'French-German', 'German-Belgium', 'Luxembourg', 'borders', 'swing', 'German', 'divisions', 'right', 'side', 'line', 'Belgium', 'down', 'north', 'France', 'major', 'engagements', 'East', 'Prussia', 'German', 'Russian', 'troops.After', 'reading', 'book', 'then', 'looked', 'documentaries', 'would', 'enhance', 'knowledge', 'learned', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'overview', 'entire', 'war', 'ending', 'legacy', 'confusion', 'fact', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'so', 'far', 'very', 'little', 'material', 'Ms.', 'Tuchman', 'award', 'winning', 'book', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'identified', 'so', 'far', 'fall', 'one', 'two', 'camps', 'produced', '1960s', 'produced', 'early', '2000s', 'initial', 'thought', 'rely', 'more', 'heavily', 'more', 'recently', 'produced', 'information', 'thinking', 'more', 'time', 'allowed', 'more', 'accurate', 'analysis', 'due', 'greater', 'objectivity', 'documentaries', 'seem', 'be', 'odds', 'most', 'Tuchman', 'major', 'points', 'e.g', 'one', 'documentary', 'point', 'Germany', 'went', 'war', 'reluctantly', 'kind', 'haphazardly', 'specific', 'plan', 'idea', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'flexible', 'based', 'conditions', 'actions', 'French', 'army', 'believing', 'war', 'would', 'last', 'years', 'totally', 'odds', 'Tuchman', 'book', 'Also', 'Tuchman', 'major', 'point', 'fact', 'German', 'battle', 'plan', 'Schleifflen', 'sp', 'Plan', 'critical', 'operation', 'was', 'placement', 'majority', 'troops', 'creating', 'overloaded', 'German', 'right', 'side', 'would', 'swing', 'Belgium', 'invade', 'France', 'north', 'come', 'down', 'behind', 'envelope', 'trap', 'French', 'army', 'engaged', 'held', 'German', 'border', 'rest', 'German', 'army', 'None', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'have', 'even', 'mentioned', 'critical', 'part', 'early', 'actions', 'August', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'references', 'German', 'French', 'prewar', 'battle', 'plans.I', 'would', 'welcome', 'someone', 'who', 'familiar', 'war', 'materials', 'available', 'learn', 'recommend', 'additional', 'books', 'best', 'documentaries', 'get', 'accurate', 'knowledge', 'subject']",N/A

I concur with the high praise given by the other reviewers.  I'd like to highlight the exceptional attention to detail and finesse brought to bear in this series.  The narrative is extremely well-crafted, examining the many subplots in this complex war in way that is still easy to follow.  The use of personal letters of ordinary people throughout humanized these events.  The silent film footage is enlivened by exacting sound effects added to replicate the action being seen (e.g., you can actually hear the sound of snow crunching beneath the feet of Italian soldiers marching through the mountains in winter).  Splicing in footage of areas as they are today also lends perspective.  The narrator skillfully guides us through the storyline without dominating the action as occurs in some other documentaries.  In short, ""The First World War"" is documentary film-making at its best; it works at all levels.  It should be a model for future documentary film makers.For those interested in further information on World War I, a newly released college course available on DVD from The Teaching Company, ""World War I,"" taught by Prof. Vejas Gabriel Liulevicius, is an excellent complement to this documentary series.",5,Bravo!,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,1325,"['wish', 'could', 'give', 'series', 'more', 'five', 'stars', 'perhaps', 'best', 'documentary', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'concur', 'high', 'praise', 'given', 'other', 'reviewers', ""'d"", 'like', 'highlight', 'exceptional', 'attention', 'detail', 'finesse', 'brought', 'bear', 'series', 'narrative', 'extremely', 'well-crafted', 'examining', 'many', 'subplots', 'complex', 'war', 'way', 'still', 'easy', 'follow', 'use', 'personal', 'letters', 'ordinary', 'people', 'humanized', 'events', 'silent', 'film', 'footage', 'enlivened', 'exacting', 'sound', 'effects', 'added', 'replicate', 'action', 'being', 'seen', 'e.g.', 'can', 'actually', 'hear', 'sound', 'snow', 'crunching', 'feet', 'Italian', 'soldiers', 'marching', 'mountains', 'winter', 'Splicing', 'footage', 'areas', 'are', 'today', 'also', 'perspective', 'narrator', 'skillfully', 'storyline', 'dominating', 'action', 'occurs', 'other', 'documentaries', 'short', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'documentary', 'film-making', 'best', 'levels', 'should', 'be', 'model', 'future', 'documentary', 'film', 'makers.For', 'interested', 'further', 'information', 'World', 'War', 'newly', 'released', 'college', 'course', 'available', 'DVD', 'Teaching', 'Company', 'World', 'War', 'taught', 'Prof.', 'Vejas', 'Gabriel', 'Liulevicius', 'excellent', 'complement', 'documentary', 'series']",N/A

911349,A2MNB9PF4QMK9P,B0009S2K9C,"givbatam3 ""givbatam3""","[1, 1]","This series is a fine introduction to the First World War. It is important, however, to be aware that this series emphasizes certain aspects of the war but does not give a clear overview of the military course of the war on the ground. Here, there is a lot of time given over to how individuals, leaders and common people perceived the war but the actual conduct of operations is glossed over.The series is to be praised for bringing to light formerly obscure aspects of the war such as the Ottoman struggle against the Russians which is usually ignored because it was not really strategically significant as was the conflict between the Ottomans and the British in the south.  The Armenian tragedy is discussed at some length showing that Turkish atrocities against Armenian civilians was a consequence of military operations in the  war and not merely a mindless ethnic persecution.  The untenable situation of the Jews in Eastern Europe who were caught between the three different empires which led to expulsion, impoverishment and pogroms is discussed at length showing that these  roots in the First World War were merely  the prelude to even worse to come.The most significant novelty of this series is that they go to great lengths to show that the view that the war was not merely a ""senseless slaughter"" and that the Generals were NOT all a bunch of stupid, arrogant men indifferent to the welfare and fate of their men. The film points out that dozens of Generals on both sides were killed in the war sharing the fate of the men at the front line, so it is wrong to picture them all as aloof people who spent their time at a chateau behind the lines.  The series points out that the technology that existed at the beginning of the war led to the stalemate in the trenches and that the Allied military leaders worked assiduously to find ways to break the stalement and that they did learn from their failures, which is what led them ultimately to victory.It is also pointed out that many if not most soldiers and civilians behind the lines believed in their cause, were willing to fight for their country and the Allied soldiers believed that it was important for the future of liberal democracy that the militarist Germans be defeated.  It is true that the war did spawn a lot of nihilistic movements and the war brutalized society making the even greater horrors of the Second World War but the final episode ends on the note that the war did prove to a lot of people that military action can provide solutions to problems for good and for bad and this has been seen in places like the Middle East and the Balkans to this day.Thus, as I stated above this series is a good introduction to the war, but someone who is interested should pursue other series made in the past, e.g. the BBC's ""The Great War"" and CBS's ""World War I"" narrated by Robert Ryan, both of which were made for the 50th anniversary of the start of the war in 1964 and both of which give a clearer outline of the military operations of the war.As a final note, I like the fact that the film shows modern views of locations seen in the archive films.  For example we see  photo of the Kaiser, Hindenburg  and Ludendorff standing in a doorway at the hotel Britannique (ironical name, isn't it?) which was their Western Front Headquarters. The film then switches to a modern view of the same doorway in color....I found this an effective way to bring these events of the past into our modern conciousness.  They also have a rare recording of the Kaiser speaking and we also see him gardening as a elderly man in exile in Holland.

911350,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B0009S2K9C,Graves,"[10, 17]","A lot of people seem to really love this and while I support a good documentary on the First World War, I do have some serious reservation about this one. It provides a great deal of film footage of the war I'd never seen before and does address other oft overlooked fronts, like in Italy and Russia but I do have questions on its outlook, its coverage and in some cases its facts.The documentary does not provide a bottom to top history of the war and does not focus so much on the battles but rather the motivation and where armies met instead of how. It is also predominantly from the outlook of the Central Powers that is Germany, the Ottoman Turks and Austria. This is fine but if you are making a documentary about the Central Powers call it that.  It goes into great detail about how the Austro-Hungarian Empire was rotting on the inside but doesn't give any hint of the turmoil that had been chewing up French society for decades. They cover the workings of the Ottoman Empire but none of the states around it. When looking at the fighting in the far east it covers the German experience but not that of the Japanese who fought them. It talks about the German staff and generals and Keiser and how they related to their opposite numbers in Austria but no such treatment is given to the Anglo-French side. Examples of this German-centric view go on and on.The editing is curious. There is a long bit on the `live and let live' elements of life on the western front whereby troops tried to coexist with their enemies on the edge of a battlefield, there is lots of film footage of soldiers relaxing but it rarely matches the words being read. For example when we are read from a letter of a British soldier, we are shown images of French troops relaxing, A German's letter is showcased with images of British troops and so on. This does not come across so much artistic as just lazy editing.Lastly there are facts that are off, either through an act of omission or being down right incorrect. For example in the early episode about the Ottomans it mentions how the Germans courted the Turkish support but fails to mention how the British stupidly drove the Turks away. It mentions how the Turks used religion to inspire their men to fight against the Europeans but never mentions that Arabs in Mecca called for jihad *against* the Turks and accepted the support of Europeans against them. There are many more such examples of omissions. One wonders what the director's intentions are when they leave out these details.It tries to say it is correcting the view that Generals were not out of touch with their troops, hiding in chateaus by listing the number of General officers killed in the war. But the French Command in Chief was in a fortress that did not have radio or even telephone connections and at Gallipoli Hamilton, the British commander, was not only not on the beaches, his base was on a Greek island some distance away! Again one asks did the writer not know this or was he trying to shape the viewers' impressions for some other reason? The only senior general to accept responsibility for the suffering of his men was the Russian Samsomof who shot himself after Tannenberg.Far more severe are the things they got badly wrong. It reports that Verdun was an attempt by the Germans to break through the French lines and the successful defense of that sector restored French spirit that had been lost since 1870. This is a rather different view of the battle since France started 1914 full of `piss and vinegar.' The accepted view of the battle, supported by German plans is that at Verdun the plan was not to `break through' the lines but to draw the French into a battle of attrition in an attempt to destroy the French army in the field and although the French held the ground in the end, it is generally recognized that the fighting spirit of France NEVER recovered from the battle they called ""The Crucible.""The bottom line here is that it is a documentary on a war that far too many people know far too little about and it does try to remove the stereotypes of the war. It provides a great deal of film footage which helps make the war more a thing of flesh and blood and not just old still photos but the curious editing and one sided reporting cannot help but make the knowledgeable viewer wonder `why is he getting this wrong?

911351,A2HRNHLIQ1D0FA,B0009S2K9C,"G. Worthy ""PlayinZsince87""","[38, 89]","I agree with the views expressed by DarthRad's review.I own the World at War series, documenting WWII, and it is 20x better than this production turned out to be. Often times while watching these DVD's I felt more compelled to sleep than to continue watching. The narration is monotone and scripted, like a man reading a historical timeline, and every 5 seconds they interject an opinion from some individual that experienced the event the narrator is referring to. Modern images of places are often not described, and geographical maps to help illustrate described events by the narrator are few. I honestly feel I could make a more entertaining documentary with the same resources.If you are looking for a good dose of combat footage and insight regarding a foot soldier's trench warfare, pilot experiences, tanks, etc. you are not going to get it here.  LOOK ELSEWHERE NOW.  Yes, they are all given brief mention with some images, but for a combat junkie like me, not nearly enough. This series is more like a high school history class and less like an authoritative source on global warfare with an abundance of information to give. This series is more of an overview of events, timelines, and history as to why our current divides exist. Which are nice and the only saving grace of the whole series. Outside of this educational value there is nothing left. There were a few moving images of men falling in battle, but in a war that killed millions and millions you would expect to see a lot more.To sum up my review: worth watching for a historical insight, but worthless when it comes to combat footage or any true visceral play on the senses.I found it laughable that the narrator was unable to conclude that the ""liberal"" leaders and their approach to debt-repayment and punishment for Germany helped spark the world's thrust into WWII. It was laughable because during this ""documentary"" the scripted narrator took liberty to use the term liberal so as to describe the term as something other than clueless.Worth watching, but I hope your expectations aren't very high when you do, because you will be disappointed. ;)",2,Not as impressed as some reviewers were ...,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,2126,"['agree', 'views', 'expressed', 'DarthRad', 'review.I', 'World', 'War', 'series', 'documenting', 'WWII', '20x', 'better', 'production', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Often', 'times', 'watching', 'DVD', 'felt', 'more', 'compelled', 'sleep', 'continue', 'watching', 'narration', 'monotone', 'scripted', 'man', 'reading', 'historical', 'timeline', '5', 'seconds', 'interject', 'opinion', 'individual', 'experienced', 'event', 'narrator', 'referring', 'Modern', 'images', 'places', 'are', 'often', 'not', 'described', 'geographical', 'maps', 'help', 'illustrate', 'described', 'events', 'narrator', 'are', 'few', 'honestly', 'feel', 'could', 'make', 'more', 'entertaining', 'documentary', 'same', 'resources.If', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'dose', 'combat', 'footage', 'insight', 'regarding', 'foot', 'soldier', 'trench', 'warfare', 'pilot', 'experiences', 'tanks', 'etc', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'here', 'LOOK', 'ELSEWHERE', 'NOW', 'Yes', 'are', 'given', 'brief', 'mention', 'images', 'combat', 'junkie', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'series', 'more', 'high', 'school', 'history', 'class', 'less', 'authoritative', 'source', 'global', 'warfare', 'abundance', 'information', 'give', 'series', 'more', 'overview', 'events', 'timelines', 'history', 'why', 'current', 'divides', 'exist', 'are', 'nice', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'whole', 'series', 'educational', 'value', 'nothing', 'left', 'were', 'few', 'moving', 'images', 'men', 'falling', 'battle', 'war', 'killed', 'millions', 'millions', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'lot', 'more.To', 'sum', 'up', 'review', 'worth', 'watching', 'historical', 'insight', 'worthless', 'when', 'combat', 'footage', 'true', 'visceral', 'play', 'senses.I', 'found', 'laughable', 'narrator', 'was', 'unable', 'conclude', 'liberal', 'leaders', 'approach', 'debt-repayment', 'punishment', 'Germany', 'helped', 'spark', 'world', 'thrust', 'WWII', 'was', 'laughable', 'documentary', 'scripted', 'narrator', 'took', 'liberty', 'use', 'term', 'liberal', 'so', 'describe', 'term', 'something', 'other', 'clueless.Worth', 'watching', 'hope', 'expectations', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'high', 'when', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

911353,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B0009S2K9C,Howard M. Kindel,"[5, 5]","This show is, quite simply, the most extraordinary thing I've ever seen.  I've always believed the First World War to be the most significant event in human history; nothing in this show has led me to believe otherwise.  What it makes clear is how truly unnecessary the First World War was and how easily it could have been halted at almost any stage, if only the opposing sides had seen fit to communicate with one another - or simply to give one another the benefit of the doubt at crucial points.  This was especially true of Germany, which based so much of its strategy on what it anticipated would happen eventually; and, of course, in doing so it made these eventualities self-fulfilling prophecies.Besides being a masterful adaption of Professor Hew Strachan's three volume series, the show is superbly organized and presented, in ten parts, to give the viewer maximum exposure to the conditions, personages and events of ""The Great War"" without the necessity of watching the entire eight hour and twenty-three minute, four disc series in one sitting.  Each of the ten parts focuses on one aspect of the War, rather than each picking up where the previous left off; so, in addition to carrying major themes along in the background, each presents a sub-theme devoted primarily to a particular phase of the War.  So, even though this requires stepping out of the time line and then back into it, the process is achieved in such a way that the viewer is able to keep each separate aspect in perspective.  And while, needless to say, there is enough material related to the First World War to fill a hundred volumes or a hundred hours of video, it is nevertheless quite a feat of editing to have included so much material and to have used it with such great economy and to such good effect.  If what you get is primarily an overview, it is an unusually well fleshed-out overview.One other thing the show accomplishes - almost as extraordinary as its presentation of the subject matter - is to highlight the enormous value of historians in the process of understanding human events, great and small.  The archival material presented is astounding; but just as astounding is what it says about the great care with which historians preserved and collected as many details as they possibly could.  Throughout the series, there are excerpts from letters written by ordinary soldiers to their families and friends back home as well as the much more easily preserved and obtainable writings and speeches of those whose task it was to oversee the War.  As a result, the viewer gets a far more complete - and far more unbiased - picture of the actual conditions than he or she would if only the carefully chosen words and phrases of those intentionally writing for history had been presented.To its credit also, as befits the highest uses of history, the show offers neither platitudes nor opinions about the human condition.  It simply presents a wealth of accumulated information; and, in so doing, allows the events themselves to speak volumes about the arrogance, stupidity and cruelty of human interaction as well as the nobility and endurance of the human spirit.  Not everything shown is unremittingly negative; some things are even light-hearted, as when, on certain portions of the Western Front, the French and British soldiers developed a rapport with the German soldiers - one of the German soldiers even warning when a shell would be fired at their trench; while others are poignant, as when Italian soldiers, unable to withstand the cold of the Alps or the dearth of rations, simply surrendered en masse to the Germans, or when Russian soldiers simply walked away from the Eastern Front, unwilling to fight any longer under impossible conditions.  And while there were some overbearing officers, many of the officers, including generals, positioned themselves along the Front with their men - a large number of generals, on all sides, being killed during this ""war to end all wars.""Of course, it didn't ""end all wars""; if anything, it guaranteed a succession of great and small wars.  Marshal Foch, the supreme French commander, commented after the War that the terms of the Treaty would lead to yet another war in twenty years.  As Jonathan Lewis, the producer and narrator of the show, observed, Foch missed it by only sixty-five days.",5,The First World War,1284076800,"09 10, 2010",2010,4345,"['show', 'quite', 'simply', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'always', 'believed', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'be', 'most', 'significant', 'event', 'human', 'history', 'nothing', 'show', 'led', 'believe', 'otherwise', 'What', 'clear', 'how', 'truly', 'unnecessary', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'was', 'how', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'halted', 'almost', 'stage', 'only', 'opposing', 'sides', 'had', 'seen', 'fit', 'communicate', 'one', 'simply', 'give', 'one', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'crucial', 'points', 'was', 'especially', 'true', 'Germany', 'based', 'so', 'much', 'strategy', 'what', 'anticipated', 'would', 'happen', 'eventually', 'course', 'doing', 'made', 'eventualities', 'self-fulfilling', 'prophecies.Besides', 'being', 'masterful', 'adaption', 'Professor', 'Hew', 'Strachan', 'three', 'volume', 'series', 'show', 'superbly', 'organized', 'presented', 'ten', 'parts', 'give', 'viewer', 'maximum', 'exposure', 'conditions', 'personages', 'events', 'Great', 'War', 'necessity', 'watching', 'entire', 'eight', 'hour', 'twenty-three', 'minute', 'four', 'disc', 'series', 'one', 'sitting', 'ten', 'parts', 'one', 'aspect', 'War', 'rather', 'picking', 'up', 'where', 'previous', 'left', 'off', 'so', 'addition', 'carrying', 'major', 'themes', 'along', 'background', 'presents', 'sub-theme', 'devoted', 'primarily', 'particular', 'phase', 'War', 'So', 'even', 'stepping', 'time', 'line', 'then', 'back', 'process', 'achieved', 'such', 'way', 'viewer', 'able', 'keep', 'separate', 'aspect', 'perspective', 'needless', 'say', 'enough', 'material', 'related', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'fill', 'hundred', 'volumes', 'hundred', 'hours', 'video', 'nevertheless', 'quite', 'feat', 'editing', 'have', 'included', 'so', 'much', 'material', 'have', 'used', 'such', 'great', 'economy', 'such', 'good', 'effect', 'what', 'get', 'primarily', 'overview', 'unusually', 'well', 'fleshed-out', 'other', 'thing', 'show', 'almost', 'extraordinary', 'presentation', 'subject', 'matter', 'highlight', 'enormous', 'value', 'historians', 'process', 'understanding', 'human', 'events', 'great', 'small', 'archival', 'material', 'presented', 'astounding', 'just', 'astounding', 'what', 'great', 'care', 'historians', 'preserved', 'collected', 'many', 'details', 'possibly', 'could', 'Throughout', 'series', 'are', 'excerpts', 'letters', 'written', 'ordinary', 'soldiers', 'families', 'friends', 'back', 'home', 'as', 'well', 'much', 'more', 'easily', 'preserved', 'obtainable', 'writings', 'speeches', 'task', 'was', 'oversee', 'War', 'result', 'viewer', 'far', 'more', 'complete', 'far', 'more', 'unbiased', 'picture', 'actual', 'conditions', 'would', 'only', 'carefully', 'chosen', 'words', 'phrases', 'intentionally', 'writing', 'history', 'had', 'been', 'presented.To', 'credit', 'also', 'befits', 'highest', 'uses', 'history', 'show', 'platitudes', 'opinions', 'human', 'condition', 'simply', 'wealth', 'accumulated', 'information', 'so', 'doing', 'events', 'speak', 'volumes', 'arrogance', 'stupidity', 'cruelty', 'human', 'interaction', 'as', 'well', 'nobility', 'endurance', 'human', 'spirit', 'Not', 'everything', 'shown', 'unremittingly', 'negative', 'things', 'are', 'even', 'light-hearted', 'when', 'certain', 'portions', 'Western', 'Front', 'French', 'British', 'soldiers', 'developed', 'rapport', 'German', 'soldiers', 'one', 'German', 'soldiers', 'even', 'warning', 'when', 'shell', 'would', 'be', 'fired', 'trench', 'others', 'are', 'poignant', 'when', 'Italian', 'soldiers', 'unable', 'withstand', 'cold', 'Alps', 'dearth', 'rations', 'simply', 'surrendered', 'en', 'masse', 'Germans', 'when', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'simply', 'walked', 'away', 'Eastern', 'Front', 'unwilling', 'fight', 'longer', 'impossible', 'conditions', 'were', 'overbearing', 'officers', 'many', 'officers', 'including', 'generals', 'positioned', 'Front', 'men', 'large', 'number', 'generals', 'sides', 'being', 'killed', 'war', 'end', 'wars', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'wars', 'anything', 'guaranteed', 'succession', 'great', 'small', 'wars', 'Marshal', 'Foch', 'supreme', 'French', 'commander', 'commented', 'War', 'terms', 'Treaty', 'would', 'lead', 'yet', 'war', 'twenty', 'years', 'Jonathan', 'Lewis', 'producer', 'narrator', 'show', 'observed', 'Foch', 'missed', 'only', 'sixty-five', 'days']",N/A

Remarkably complete and ultimately absorbing, this series does for WWI what ""World At War"" (1973) did for WWII.  Every installment is a fascinating, up-close and comprehensive examination of the often complex elements and participants fighting in the world's first truly ""modern war.""Special attention is paid to specific details that most other series leave out; for example, the role of the Ottoman Turks, the significant naval battles between Germany and Great Britain, the battles in the Middle East, and the contributions of the British Commonwealth soldiers from across the Empire. It makes the old CBS series narrated by Robert Ryan a mere footnote and PBS's politically-correct ""The Great War"" resemble something of a mere amateur documentary filmmaker. Much of the unseen footage secured by Channel 4 in making the documentary was recently discovered from archives in Central and Eastern Europe.  The series also takes a close-up look of the weaponry and the letters/diary entries of soldiers from both sides.Can a excellent documentary compel you to read more on the subject?  Well, this one certainly can.  This series makes WWI a most fascinating subject worthy of further study and analysis. Too often, what has been mistakenly taught in school is that WWI was merely a ""dress rehersal"" for the rise of fascism and WWII.  This series proves otherwise and we need more first-class documentary series like this. Kudos to Johnathan Lewis and Channel 4 for putting together such a superb series.

It probably has more information about WW I than any other single cinematic representation. It was worth the cost, and it deserves five stars. Still I was left a bit wanting (explained below).Its four DVDs are neatly and securely placed in an artistic, colorful pack, including a well-done 32-page color booklet that summarizes each of the ten episodes.Of course no cinema is going to give you the full wealth of interesting WW I information provided by a textual history. On the other hand no textual history will give you this documentary's real look at the people, the places, and the artifacts (buildings, machines, and equipment). Thus the title for my review. As eye-candy, to supplement the black-and-white film, the series provides color film of contemporary sites to compare them with the sites of nearly a century ago. A good idea.How was I left wanting? The battles. Specifically, battle maps with play-by-play depictions. That is, colorful displays of plans and tactics, showing how units were deployed; how they moved, converged, and retreated; and the battle's turning points. For example, Germany receives fair attention for its victory at Tannenberg, but Tannenberg is one of the more interesting battles in history. The series says nothing about why and how this is so. Generally this series gives battles only light coverage, and some major battles are not even mentioned. Though Gallipoli and Amiens receive a good amount of attention, even they are not given detailed battle maps.Edit: After watching this series, I decided to read G. J. Meyer's ""A World Undone,"" a good popular history of the war. As I expected, it has tons of interesting information excluded from this video series. Particularly it has good accounts of at least some of the battles (not ALL of them, of course). To supplement my reading, I have been re-watching the series. Make no mistake!

911380,A6060VY7A6CF4,B0009S2K9C,Zev Toledano,"[15, 15]","This is a comparison for people that, like me, were wondering which documentary to purchase for WWI. I found this release, 'The First World War' (FWW) by BBC4, as well as 'The Great War' (GW) by the BBC to be the best of their kind, having watched them both in full, and also having sampled two other releases ('The Complete Story: World War I', and 'Century of Warfare') and found them both to be inferior.Both FWW and GW have pros and cons, and I found the choice between them to be a very close call.First of all, FWW is about 9 hours and GW is 18 hours long. But that doesn't automatically mean that GW is more comprehensive or better. Let me explain:In terms of coverage and comprehensiveness, both have some information and footage that the other lacks. In general, I felt that GW is superb with the small picture (details) and pretty good with the big picture, whereas FWW is superb with the big picture, and medium with the details. Some examples:FWW is more complete when it comes to analysis and politics. It provides plausible answers to questions such as why did the Ottoman Empire, Romania and Italy join the war, whereas GW did not. It also provides unique insights and research on a wide range of topics such as the German campaign to destabilize their enemies' home fronts, the African theatre, and interesting facts such as the Jews who fought with the Germans against the relatively worse Russian brutality. If you prioritize big-picture insights and unique points of interest, FWW is for you.On the other hand, FWW didn't cover important battles to complete satisfaction such as Verdun and Gallipoli, and others it didn't cover at all (Somme, Ypres). If you prioritize battle details, GW is for you.GW is comprehensive in its details to a fault. It provides a blow by blow narrative of the whole Western Front theatre from start to finish, including the logistics, the viewpoints of soldiers, every attack and counter-attack, the detailed horrors of trench warfare, etc. whereas FWW jumps and skips as necessary to provide a big-picture summary instead. GW may be too much for some, or it may be just what the doctor ordered for the more detail-oriented.In GW, trench warfare is explored in all its horror and the personal effects it had on soldiers, but then episode after episode covers yet another and another trench war, more guns blazing, more mass killings, more psychological breakdowns, and so on, which may be a bit tiring, unless you want to experience a bit of what it was like to go through this horrible war.Which brings me to another strong point of GW: Its approach of high drama, dramatic music, poetic readings, veteran interviews, detailed narrative, and deep explorations of the psyche of civilians and soldiers will make you feel the war emotionally as well as mentally. If you want to FEEL the war, then you definitely need GW.FWW chose its details carefully, presenting a sampling for each stage of the war, placing emphasis on points of interest or insight rather than on how they complete the narrative of the war. You will get most of the information you need from FWW, and it provides insights into the people's hearts and minds, but you will not feel the full weight of what it was like to live it, as with GW.As mentioned, GW provides interviews of veterans (FWW does not), but keep in mind that they are only from a soldier's point of view, and there are no interviews with decision-makers as with 'World at War'. Both GW and FWW provide a rich and insightful tapestry of letters and quotes, read by voice-actors. FWW also adds its own interesting touches such as children's diaries, and plays/movies relevant to the war, as well as some useless current-day footage of the countries and locations used as a backdrop for the narrative.GW is not balanced like FWW in terms of time used for each aspect of the war: It emphasizes anything British first, then French, and it provides a linear blow-by-blow timeline of the Western Front, and relatively less time for the rest. But, since GW is so long and comprehensive, you won't feel that other aspects were left out, only that they were less important.Finally, the loud music in GW often adds to the drama, but sometimes gets intrusive.In summary, both are recommended. If you can't get enough of WWI, then get both. If you have to choose one, then perhaps this review will help you decide.",4,Comparison to BBC's The Great War,1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,4385,"['comparison', 'people', 'were', 'wondering', 'documentary', 'purchase', 'WWI', 'found', 'release', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'FWW', 'BBC4', 'as', 'well', ""'The"", 'Great', 'War', 'GW', 'BBC', 'be', 'best', 'kind', 'having', 'watched', 'full', 'also', 'having', 'sampled', 'two', 'other', 'releases', ""'The"", 'Complete', 'Story', 'World', 'War', ""'Century"", 'Warfare', 'found', 'be', 'inferior.Both', 'FWW', 'GW', 'have', 'pros', 'cons', 'found', 'choice', 'be', 'very', 'close', 'call.First', 'FWW', '9', 'hours', 'GW', '18', 'hours', 'long', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'mean', 'GW', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'better', 'Let', 'explain', 'terms', 'coverage', 'comprehensiveness', 'have', 'information', 'footage', 'other', 'lacks', 'general', 'felt', 'GW', 'superb', 'small', 'picture', 'details', 'pretty', 'good', 'big', 'picture', 'whereas', 'FWW', 'superb', 'big', 'picture', 'medium', 'details', 'examples', 'FWW', 'more', 'complete', 'when', 'analysis', 'politics', 'plausible', 'answers', 'questions', 'such', 'why', 'did', 'Ottoman', 'Empire', 'Romania', 'Italy', 'join', 'war', 'whereas', 'GW', 'did', 'not', 'also', 'unique', 'insights', 'research', 'wide', 'range', 'topics', 'such', 'German', 'campaign', 'destabilize', 'enemies', 'home', 'fronts', 'African', 'theatre', 'interesting', 'facts', 'such', 'Jews', 'who', 'fought', 'Germans', 'relatively', 'worse', 'Russian', 'brutality', 'prioritize', 'big-picture', 'insights', 'unique', 'points', 'interest', 'FWW', 'you.On', 'other', 'hand', 'FWW', 'did', ""n't"", 'cover', 'important', 'battles', 'complete', 'satisfaction', 'such', 'Verdun', 'Gallipoli', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'cover', 'Somme', 'Ypres', 'prioritize', 'battle', 'details', 'GW', 'you.GW', 'comprehensive', 'details', 'fault', 'blow', 'blow', 'narrative', 'whole', 'Western', 'Front', 'theatre', 'start', 'finish', 'including', 'logistics', 'viewpoints', 'soldiers', 'attack', 'counter-attack', 'detailed', 'horrors', 'trench', 'warfare', 'etc', 'whereas', 'FWW', 'jumps', 'skips', 'necessary', 'provide', 'big-picture', 'summary', 'instead', 'GW', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'what', 'doctor', 'ordered', 'more', 'detail-oriented.In', 'GW', 'trench', 'warfare', 'explored', 'horror', 'personal', 'effects', 'had', 'soldiers', 'then', 'episode', 'episode', 'yet', 'trench', 'war', 'more', 'guns', 'blazing', 'more', 'mass', 'killings', 'more', 'psychological', 'breakdowns', 'so', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'tiring', 'want', 'experience', 'bit', 'what', 'was', 'go', 'horrible', 'war.Which', 'strong', 'point', 'GW', 'approach', 'high', 'drama', 'dramatic', 'music', 'poetic', 'readings', 'veteran', 'interviews', 'detailed', 'narrative', 'deep', 'explorations', 'psyche', 'civilians', 'soldiers', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'war', 'emotionally', 'as', 'well', 'mentally', 'want', 'FEEL', 'war', 'then', 'definitely', 'need', 'GW.FWW', 'chose', 'details', 'carefully', 'presenting', 'sampling', 'stage', 'war', 'placing', 'emphasis', 'points', 'interest', 'insight', 'rather', 'how', 'complete', 'narrative', 'war', 'will', 'get', 'most', 'information', 'need', 'FWW', 'insights', 'people', 'hearts', 'minds', 'will', 'not', 'feel', 'full', 'weight', 'what', 'was', 'live', 'GW.As', 'mentioned', 'GW', 'interviews', 'veterans', 'FWW', 'not', 'keep', 'mind', 'are', 'only', 'soldier', 'point', 'view', 'are', 'interviews', 'decision-makers', ""'World"", 'War', 'GW', 'FWW', 'provide', 'rich', 'insightful', 'tapestry', 'letters', 'quotes', 'read', 'voice-actors', 'FWW', 'also', 'own', 'interesting', 'touches', 'such', 'children', 'diaries', 'plays/movies', 'relevant', 'war', 'as', 'well', 'useless', 'current-day', 'footage', 'countries', 'locations', 'used', 'backdrop', 'narrative.GW', 'not', 'balanced', 'FWW', 'terms', 'time', 'used', 'aspect', 'war', 'anything', 'British', 'first', 'then', 'French', 'linear', 'blow-by-blow', 'timeline', 'Western', 'Front', 'relatively', 'less', 'time', 'rest', 'GW', 'so', 'long', 'comprehensive', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'other', 'aspects', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'only', 'were', 'less', 'important.Finally', 'loud', 'music', 'GW', 'often', 'drama', 'sometimes', 'intrusive.In', 'summary', 'are', 'recommended', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'WWI', 'then', 'get', 'have', 'choose', 'one', 'then', 'perhaps', 'review', 'will', 'help', 'decide']",N/A
