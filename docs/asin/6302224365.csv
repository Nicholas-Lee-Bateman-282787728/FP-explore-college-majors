302320,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6302224365,C. O. DeRiemer,"[4, 6]","We're going to have to keep some things straight, so please pay attention. ""A"" is loyal, sincere and society-style rich. Her mom's even richer. She's in love with ""B,"" a charming, compulsive philanderer and nicely turned-out cad. They're married. Every Thursday they go to Mom's mansion to have dinner for three. ""C"" is a luscious, high-gloss tramp who knows what she wants and when she wants it. Now that ""B"" is into the money, she might want to take up where things left off with him before he married ""A."" ""D"" is decent, honorable, and patriotic, with a past that's part detective, part U. S. spy. He loves ""A,"" who sees him as a wonderful friend. He detests ""B,"" and sees him for what he is, the rain on ""A""'s obliviously happy parade. ""E"" is a nice kid to come home to after a hard day's work. She'd have dinner ready and the pillows plumped. ""E"" may seem a little bland but she's got great legs. She loves ""D,"" but he's too decent to be anything but decent toward her.With Mom observing, with the drinks poured, with easy morals on the East Side, with loving commitment on the West Side and with everyone extremely well groomed, the anguish starts and the tears flow. If it weren't for murder and two other elements, East Side, West Side would probably only be worth remembering by the fans of women's weepies. The murder and the hunt for the murderer take up the last half of the movie. Death provides some great, gloomy photography and some needed energy. Stanwyck as the murder suspect provides...I guess she provides the plot.The best things about this movie, however, are those two other elements: Barbara Stanwyck and James Mason. Just for the record, Stanwyck is ""A,"" Mason is ""B,"" Ava Gardner is ""C,"" Van Heflin is ""D,"" and Cyd Charisse is ""E."" And we shouldn't forget Gale Sondergard, one of Hollywood's great character actors who plays Stanwyck's mother. Mason may pull the wool over Bab's eyes (and we kind of like him when he does), but Sondergard, as gracious and as smooth as old gold dollars, is a woman to be wary of when she smiles sympathetically.One can understand why Stanwyck agreed to the movie. She was still a major name-above-the-title star, but she was on the down slope of age. East Side, West Side gave her a chance to play believably younger than she was, to look stylishly dressed and coifed at all times, to move around in the kind of upper-crust apartments only Hollywood could decorate, to emote everything from love to regret, from anxiety to calm resolution. It's her movie, and she risked loosing it only when James Mason decided to take the intriguing part of the hopeless, hapless, assured and self-deceiving cad Stanwyck has married. Stanwyck remains Stanwyck, one of Hollywood's rare stand-alone actresses on whom any film she's in seems always to focus on her. Mason usually had that same affect. He could come off as cruel (The Seventh Veil), or a rogue (The Wicked Lady) or hopelessly sad (Odd Man Out), but it was hard not to concentrate on him. When cruel, he could be romantic. When a rogue, he could be dangerous and good company. When hopelessly sad, he could embody feelings close to tragedy. But, my goodness, just look at the roles he picked to play when he came over to Hollywood in the late Forties. Mason made his own choices. He was intelligent and a risk taker. He liked working for first-rate directors. He often made possible small films by agreeing to star in them. He was a superb film actor. And here he is in East Side, West Side as Barbara Stanwyck's husband, a man unable to keep his pants zipped.Stanwyck brings authenticity to the movie, even though it's all Hollywood. She has to contend with too many major characters and too many balls in the air. Mason, however, makes us like the situation. Two scenes toward the end of the movie, the first when he has a conversation with Gale Sondergard as Stanwyck's mother, and the second when he leaves a message over the phone to be delivered to Sondergard, are both high-class bits of immensely satisfying comeuppance acting.Mason had a long career and played in some real doozies, but I can't think of a performance of his I've seen that I didn't enjoy. Try him inThe Reckless Moment, (1946) a great film directed by Max Ophuls, or, at the end of his career, inThe Shooting Party(1985). As for Stanwyck, there are a lot of movies to like. For melodrama, death and under-appreciated Hollywood angst, tryThe Strange Love of Martha Ivers(1946).",3,"A loyal, rich wife, a prowling husband with a slippery zipper, a murder...Barbara Stanwyck, James Mason, lots of melodrama",1252627200,"09 11, 2009",2009,4459,"[""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'keep', 'things', 'straight', 'please', 'pay', 'attention', 'loyal', 'sincere', 'society-style', 'rich', 'mom', 'even', 'richer', 'love', 'B', 'charming', 'compulsive', 'philanderer', 'nicely', 'turned-out', 'cad', ""'re"", 'married', 'Thursday', 'go', 'Mom', 'mansion', 'have', 'dinner', 'three', 'C', 'luscious', 'high-gloss', 'tramp', 'who', 'what', 'when', 'Now', 'B', 'money', 'might', 'want', 'take', 'up', 'where', 'things', 'left', 'off', 'married', 'D', 'decent', 'honorable', 'patriotic', 'past', 'part', 'detective', 'part', 'U.', 'S.', 'spy', 'A', 'who', 'wonderful', 'friend', 'B', 'what', 'rain', 'A', 'obliviously', 'happy', 'parade', 'E', 'nice', 'kid', 'come', 'home', 'hard', 'day', 'work', ""'d"", 'have', 'dinner', 'ready', 'pillows', 'plumped', 'E', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'bland', 'got', 'great', 'legs', 'D', 'too', 'decent', 'be', 'anything', 'decent', 'her.With', 'Mom', 'observing', 'drinks', 'poured', 'easy', 'morals', 'East', 'Side', 'loving', 'commitment', 'West', 'Side', 'everyone', 'extremely', 'well', 'groomed', 'anguish', 'starts', 'tears', 'flow', 'were', ""n't"", 'murder', 'two', 'other', 'elements', 'East', 'Side', 'West', 'Side', 'would', 'probably', 'only', 'be', 'worth', 'remembering', 'fans', 'women', 'weepies', 'murder', 'hunt', 'murderer', 'take', 'up', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'Death', 'great', 'gloomy', 'photography', 'needed', 'energy', 'Stanwyck', 'murder', 'suspect', 'guess', 'plot.The', 'best', 'things', 'movie', 'however', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'elements', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'James', 'Mason', 'Just', 'record', 'Stanwyck', 'A', 'Mason', 'B', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'C', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'D', 'Cyd', 'Charisse', 'E.', 'should', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Gale', 'Sondergard', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'who', 'plays', 'Stanwyck', 'mother', 'Mason', 'may', 'pull', 'wool', 'Bab', 'eyes', 'kind', 'when', 'Sondergard', 'gracious', 'as', 'smooth', 'old', 'gold', 'dollars', 'woman', 'be', 'wary', 'when', 'sympathetically.One', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'Stanwyck', 'agreed', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'major', 'name-above-the-title', 'star', 'was', 'down', 'slope', 'age', 'East', 'Side', 'West', 'Side', 'gave', 'chance', 'play', 'believably', 'younger', 'was', 'look', 'stylishly', 'dressed', 'coifed', 'times', 'move', 'around', 'kind', 'upper-crust', 'apartments', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'decorate', 'emote', 'everything', 'love', 'regret', 'anxiety', 'calm', 'resolution', 'movie', 'risked', 'loosing', 'only', 'when', 'James', 'Mason', 'decided', 'take', 'intriguing', 'part', 'hopeless', 'hapless', 'assured', 'self-deceiving', 'cad', 'Stanwyck', 'married', 'Stanwyck', 'Stanwyck', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'rare', 'stand-alone', 'actresses', 'whom', 'film', 'always', 'focus', 'Mason', 'usually', 'had', 'same', 'affect', 'could', 'come', 'off', 'cruel', 'Seventh', 'Veil', 'rogue', 'Wicked', 'Lady', 'hopelessly', 'sad', 'Odd', 'Man', 'Out', 'was', 'hard', 'not', 'concentrate', 'When', 'cruel', 'could', 'be', 'romantic', 'When', 'rogue', 'could', 'be', 'dangerous', 'good', 'company', 'When', 'hopelessly', 'sad', 'could', 'embody', 'feelings', 'close', 'tragedy', 'goodness', 'just', 'look', 'roles', 'picked', 'play', 'when', 'came', 'over', 'Hollywood', 'late', 'Forties', 'Mason', 'made', 'own', 'choices', 'was', 'intelligent', 'risk', 'taker', 'liked', 'working', 'first-rate', 'directors', 'often', 'made', 'possible', 'small', 'films', 'agreeing', 'star', 'was', 'superb', 'film', 'actor', 'here', 'East', 'Side', 'West', 'Side', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'husband', 'man', 'unable', 'keep', 'pants', 'zipped.Stanwyck', 'authenticity', 'movie', 'even', 'Hollywood', 'contend', 'too', 'many', 'major', 'characters', 'too', 'many', 'balls', 'air', 'Mason', 'however', 'situation', 'Two', 'scenes', 'end', 'movie', 'first', 'when', 'conversation', 'Gale', 'Sondergard', 'Stanwyck', 'mother', 'second', 'when', 'message', 'phone', 'be', 'delivered', 'Sondergard', 'are', 'high-class', 'bits', 'immensely', 'satisfying', 'comeuppance', 'acting.Mason', 'had', 'long', 'career', 'played', 'real', 'doozies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'Try', 'inThe', 'Reckless', 'Moment', '1946', 'great', 'film', 'directed', 'Max', 'Ophuls', 'end', 'career', 'inThe', 'Shooting', 'Party', '1985', 'Stanwyck', 'are', 'lot', 'movies', 'like', 'melodrama', 'death', 'under-appreciated', 'Hollywood', 'angst', 'tryThe', 'Strange', 'Love', 'Martha', 'Ivers', '1946']",East Side West Side VHS
302321,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,6302224365,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[1, 1]","""East Side, West Side""(MGM, 1949)This hybrid film noir/romance melodrama is a fascinating entry from the post-WWII era that blends broken hearts with busted noses.  The central character is Barbara Stanwyck's tortured, conflicted Jessie, an uptown socialite whose philandering husband (played deliciously by James Mason) seems hell-bent on destroying their marriage. When his old flame (a very naughty, very nasty Ava Gardner) comes back to town, old wounds are reopened, and Stanwyck has to choose -- again -- how much mental abuse she can take from one thoughtless man.  Although this has the makings of a Douglas Sirk saga, the weepy melodrama is counterbalanced by a steady stream of hard-bitten, cynical noir tough talk and witty banter, culminating in a brutal murder and a brief whodunnit mystery.The female-produced script -- based on a book by Marcia Davenport and adapted for the screen by Isobel Lennart -- presents characters who are unusually nuanced. Mason is charming but a thorough cad; Stanwyck is likeable but self-consciously passive; the temptress Ava Gardner is just plain evil and the manly g-man Van Helflin is also civilized and reserved. Similarly, minor characters share these layers, and this film offers new shades to old Hollywood archetypes. (In one climactic scene, there is a brutish mutual fistfight between a man and a woman -- something we'd never seen like this, particularly in a film of this era -- an exchange that may still shock even today's jaded modern viewers...) A cool old film, and a treat for fans of both genres.

302322,A1W60EH12T0FQ7,6302224365,James W. Milburn,"[1, 2]","-----Ava Gardner is in this movie; I bought it for that reason. Her role is typical for her: a home-wrecker in a slinky black dress.  Her great beauty made that very understandable to an audience; she was very good at it.  This movie is high-quality soap opera.  The biggest defect of the movie is the actress who plays an ""Amazon Woman"" who can strangle Ava Gardner's character to death with little effort.  Apparently, no one noticed the actress was no amazon.  I read the actress was only 5'7"" tall.  The characters keep telling each other that she is an amazon; apparently trying to convince the audience that she is.  What is needed is a woman well over 6' tall to play the amazon role; a female Governor Arnold Swartznegger (6'4""+?) would be perfect.  I feel this one defect destroys credibility; it drags down the whole movie.  The ""Amazon Woman"" actress does a great job with the role, but she is just not an amazon. This movie has some great comic moments.  It is worth the price and the time.

Brandon had an affair with Isabel Lorrison (Ava Gardner) in the past, but she went to Europe and Jessie and Brandon reconciled. Jessie loves Brandon terribly, but when she hears that Isabel is back in town, she's afraid. Her fears are confirmed as Brandon and Isabel continue their relationship. Meanwhile, Mark Dwyer (Van Heflin), an agent for the government, falls in love with Jessie. Jessie likes Mark but only wants to be friends with him because she loves her husband, even though he cheats on her. One day, Isabel calls Jessie and tells her to come to her apartment. Jessie comes and they get into an argument. Jessie leaves with Mark and two hours later, Brandon goes to Isabel's apartment, finding her dead. Who killed her?This typical melodrama is saved by its all-star cast and good performances from all stars, but Stanwyck and Gardner give the best performances by far. Gardner is excellent as the self-proclaimed ""cheap"" harlot who knows how to make a man want her and keep on wanting her and Stanwyck shines in her wronged-wife character. Incidentally, Gardner and Robert Taylor, Stanwyck's husband at the time, had just had an affair during the filming of ""The Bribe"". I detect a hint of art imitates life here, especially in the scene where Isabel and Jessie have their little talk in Isabel's apartment, perhaps the most powerful scene in the film.Fans of Stanwyck or Gardner should like this movie, even though it's not the best of the former nor the latter.

302326,A2TU3RO6244TZ2,6302224365,Stargazer,"[0, 0]","East Side West Side, is a story about a woman who grew up on the poor side of town,but is now a wealthy socialite living with her husband who has promised to mend his ways and stay true to their marriage. He is Brandon Bourne (James Mason) a solicitor who had an affair with Isabel Lorrison (Ava Gardiner) which nearly caused the breakup of his marriage to the well liked and respected Jessie Bourne (Barbara Stanwyck).To the concern of her friends,Jessie forgives Brandon and believes him when he pledges his undying love for her. However Brandon is a louse, and when he meets up with a young model Rose Senta (Cyd Charise) in his favourite club, and discovers she knows who his wife is - it doesn't send out the red danger sign warning that it should. Along comes his former mistress Isabel Lorrison who has just arrived back in New York after some time away. The man that Isabel came in with sees her swept along by Brandon and follows them outside, where a fight ensures and photographers take Brandon's photo - spread eagled on the footpath.Rosa comes to his rescue and bundles Brandon into a taxi and takes him to her home to sober up.It is this incident that sends East Side,West Side spiraling into a series of confrontations and questions, that set up the rest of the movie.1.Brandon has to go home and tell his long suffering wife that he's likely to be on the front page of the newspapers in a few hours - he wasn't where he said he was and anyway it wasn't his fault, it was all a misunderstanding...2.The next day Jessie goes to her favourite fashion house to meet Rose for confirmation of Brandon's ""far fetched""story. Rose verifies her part in the incident and Jessie thanks her for getting Brandon away from the incident so quickly.The two become friends and Jessie offers to drive Rose to the airport to meet her ""fella"" Mark Dwyer (Van Heflin) home from reporting on the European situation. Mark and Jessie discover they are both going to be attending the same party that evening,and when Brandon fails to arrive home in time to take Jessie to the party,she goes on alone.3.Finally, Jess telephones Brandon's secretary at home and discovers that Isabel Lorrison turned up at the office without an appointment to see Brandon. Jessie is shattered by this latest betrayal and Mark, alarmed by the state she is in, takes her home.As time goes on we see Jessie and Mark discover they both come from the poor side of town,both have strong Italian ties, and they really get on.When Jessie and her errant husband face each other it is Brandon who asks his wife for understanding - as he tries to explain his inexcusable behaviour.Brandon ""Jess, can't you understand what this is for me ? I'm like a drunk who knows liquor will wreck him. He hates it. He hides from it. He tries...he tries.."" Jessie ""What are you asking for ? Permission ?""Ava Gardiner - who often played the temptress in her earlier career - is again the seductress. She goes after what she wants and her language to Brandon leaves the audience in no doubt as to the kind of physical relationship she wants again - with Brandon.Like most popular Hollywood movies of it's time, the roster of good actors in East Side,West Side runs deep. Nancy Davis plays Jessie's best friend who is concerned for her friend and disturbed by Brandon's behaviour. Gale Sondergaard is Nora Kernan, Jessie's mother. I have written about her before in The Letter as the Chinese mistress seeking revenge. Her career was ruined by the HUAC during the McCarthy era, but she was always a fine actress. Beverly Michaels - all 5feet 9inches of her - plays the dreaded Felice, whose man is being wooed away by Isabel. Felice is a nasty piece of work, who can take care of herself in a fight,as Mark Dwyer discovers. I don't know much about Ms Michael's career, but she was very effective and utterly convincing in East Side,West Side.This film is entertaining, a bit too ""folksy"" for 2012, but is blessed by the presence of the great Miss Stanwyck, who was far and away one of the best actors of her time, James Mason - whose English films often saw him play the cruel cad - was perfectly cast as Brandon Bourne. Van Heflin, who was a quiet achiever in Hollywood, beautifully underplays his perfomance as the decent Mark Dwyer,and they were well supported by the likes of Nancy Davis,Gale Sondergaard, and Beverly Michaels.

302327,A1B1F6YL4KP3S6,6302224365,Tonio Gas,"[9, 10]","""East Side, West Side"" is definitely not an intellectual picture, but it is so skillfully written and performed that it seems to be ""better than it is"" (Jerry Vermilye). The classical love triangle is worth watching, because it analyses an all-day marriage crisis with sometimes allegoric and witty dialogue which deals with the situation of a woman in her forties, married to an allegedly gentle, charming, but desperately weak husband who is attracted by a much younger - sorry - bitch (Ava Gardner). The movie shows the suffering beyond an all-day couples' life, and despite its banality, it is somehow feminist, because it demonstrates that a woman in her forties has much to lose and few to win. Having cared for his husband whom she desperately loves, she is neglected and betrayed for younger, exciting flesh. In a Hollywood picture of 1949, adultery has to be punished, but the ending of the film is nevertheless a consequent one, because this is a film about a weak, sexually and emotionally immature husband (James Mason) and a typical upper-class American housewife (Barbara Stanwyck) who is right in closing the door behind him. But there is no kind of triumph or women's lib in this attitude, for it is clear that Stanwyck's character has no alternative in life. She is an intelligent woman who gave up her ambitions long ago, and society will not allow her to come together with a sympathetic policeman (Van Heflin) who would be a perfect friend or husband for her. All this married life is full of constraint and hypocrisy. We see Mason and Stanwyck passing from ritual to ritual, from faade to faade, they have their weekly meetings with Stanwycks parents, their cocktail bars, etc., but apart from this, their life is empty. For a long time, Stanwyck is not complaining on it, but tries to save her marriage motivated by a deep love for her husband. She is not the tough lady we have seen in so many Stanwyck pictures, but she fights a nevertheless intense struggle with much - dignity. Yes, it is her dignity she tries to keep. This may not be the best movie ever, it is sometimes a bit soapy, but this is one of the best performances of Barbara Stanwyck. Her dignity and anxiousness are never hysterical, but emotionally touching and acted with a certain understatement which reveals her intense struggle to keep up the faade. The most remarkable scene she has is a conversation with her good friend (Nancy Davis, the later Mrs. Nancy Reagan). She predicts not to be afraid at all, but in some minutes, it is revealed that she is more afraid than ever. You don't remark any acting when her face, her voice and her self-consciousness change step by step, minute by minute, very slowly, but inevitably. And when you finally realize what happens with her, you will remark that Stanwyck herself has not realized it before and is mostly shocked about herself and the life she lives.Ava Gardner is good in the ""bitchy"" part, although her part lacks any ambiguity. But it is remarkable how openly she plays the vamp card. ""Cheap, that's what you like"", she says to Mason, knowing she's right. Therefore, this allegedly soapy tearjerker is also a deconstruction of masculinity. And it's the proof that Hollywood should not neglect actresses beyond the 40th birthday. In a film released in 1949, we have remarkable confrontations between Stanwyck (* 1907) and Gardner (* 1922) in which the former deliberately searches the direct duel, knowing that it will be very difficult for her to win. But there is no doubt that she's the lead in this picture, which unfortunately was difficult for women older than forty. They were offered minor parts, Bette Davis (whom I adore) made the campy ""Beyond the Forest"" in the same year, playing a too old vamp with a silly wig, but Stanwyck got that wonderful part and played it so skillfully and touching. This is why I love this movie, despite some obvious mistakes. For example, a murder and its solution in the last twenty minutes are rather abrupt, silly and nothing more than a plot device in order to reveal that Mason didn't keep his promise not to see Gardner again. But as I tried to explain, the essential is elsewhere.The picture has an outstanding cast (Stanwyck, Mason, Van Heflin, Cid Charisse, Nancy Davis, and Gale Sondergaard) and is directed by MGM veteran Melvyn LeRoy. The DVD quality is good, but there is some background noise during the dialogue. Unfortunately there is no audio commentary, but a funny Tex Avery Cartoon as additional material.",5,One of the best women's melodramas ever (spoiler),1260230400,"12 8, 2009",2009,4514,"['East', 'Side', 'West', 'Side', 'definitely', 'not', 'intellectual', 'picture', 'so', 'skillfully', 'written', 'performed', 'be', 'better', 'Jerry', 'Vermilye', 'classical', 'love', 'triangle', 'worth', 'watching', 'all-day', 'marriage', 'crisis', 'sometimes', 'allegoric', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'situation', 'woman', 'forties', 'married', 'allegedly', 'gentle', 'charming', 'desperately', 'weak', 'husband', 'who', 'attracted', 'much', 'younger', 'sorry', 'bitch', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'movie', 'suffering', 'all-day', 'couples', 'life', 'banality', 'somehow', 'feminist', 'woman', 'forties', 'much', 'lose', 'few', 'win', 'Having', 'cared', 'husband', 'whom', 'desperately', 'neglected', 'betrayed', 'younger', 'exciting', 'flesh', 'Hollywood', 'picture', '1949', 'adultery', 'be', 'punished', 'ending', 'film', 'nevertheless', 'consequent', 'one', 'film', 'weak', 'sexually', 'emotionally', 'immature', 'husband', 'James', 'Mason', 'typical', 'upper-class', 'American', 'housewife', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'who', 'right', 'closing', 'door', 'kind', 'triumph', 'women', 'lib', 'attitude', 'clear', 'Stanwyck', 'character', 'alternative', 'life', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'ambitions', 'long', 'ago', 'society', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'come', 'together', 'sympathetic', 'policeman', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'friend', 'husband', 'married', 'life', 'full', 'constraint', 'hypocrisy', 'see', 'Mason', 'Stanwyck', 'passing', 'ritual', 'ritual', 'faade', 'faade', 'have', 'weekly', 'meetings', 'Stanwycks', 'parents', 'cocktail', 'bars', 'etc.', 'apart', 'life', 'empty', 'long', 'time', 'Stanwyck', 'not', 'complaining', 'tries', 'save', 'marriage', 'motivated', 'deep', 'love', 'husband', 'not', 'tough', 'lady', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'Stanwyck', 'pictures', 'nevertheless', 'intense', 'struggle', 'much', 'dignity', 'Yes', 'dignity', 'keep', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'soapy', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'dignity', 'anxiousness', 'are', 'never', 'hysterical', 'emotionally', 'touching', 'acted', 'certain', 'understatement', 'intense', 'struggle', 'keep', 'up', 'faade', 'most', 'remarkable', 'scene', 'conversation', 'good', 'friend', 'Nancy', 'Davis', 'later', 'Mrs.', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'minutes', 'revealed', 'more', 'afraid', 'ever', 'do', ""n't"", 'remark', 'acting', 'when', 'face', 'voice', 'self-consciousness', 'change', 'step', 'step', 'minute', 'minute', 'very', 'slowly', 'inevitably', 'when', 'finally', 'realize', 'what', 'will', 'remark', 'Stanwyck', 'not', 'realized', 'mostly', 'shocked', 'life', 'lives.Ava', 'Gardner', 'good', 'bitchy', 'part', 'part', 'ambiguity', 'remarkable', 'how', 'openly', 'vamp', 'card', 'Cheap', 'what', 'like', 'Mason', 'knowing', 'right', 'Therefore', 'allegedly', 'soapy', 'tearjerker', 'also', 'deconstruction', 'masculinity', 'proof', 'Hollywood', 'should', 'not', 'neglect', 'actresses', '40th', 'birthday', 'film', 'released', '1949', 'have', 'remarkable', 'confrontations', 'Stanwyck', '*', '1907', 'Gardner', '*', '1922', 'former', 'deliberately', 'direct', 'duel', 'knowing', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'win', 'doubt', 'lead', 'picture', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'difficult', 'women', 'older', 'forty', 'were', 'offered', 'minor', 'parts', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'whom', 'adore', 'made', 'campy', 'Forest', 'same', 'year', 'playing', 'too', 'old', 'vamp', 'silly', 'wig', 'Stanwyck', 'got', 'wonderful', 'part', 'played', 'so', 'skillfully', 'touching', 'why', 'love', 'movie', 'obvious', 'mistakes', 'example', 'murder', 'solution', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'are', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'silly', 'nothing', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'order', 'reveal', 'Mason', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'promise', 'not', 'see', 'Gardner', 'again', 'tried', 'explain', 'essential', 'elsewhere.The', 'picture', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'Stanwyck', 'Mason', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'Cid', 'Charisse', 'Nancy', 'Davis', 'Gale', 'Sondergaard', 'directed', 'MGM', 'veteran', 'Melvyn', 'LeRoy', 'DVD', 'quality', 'good', 'background', 'noise', 'dialogue', 'Unfortunately', 'audio', 'commentary', 'funny', 'Tex', 'Avery', 'Cartoon', 'additional', 'material']",East Side West Side VHS
