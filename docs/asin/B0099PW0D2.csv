1589613,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0099PW0D2,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[15, 17]","An unidentified  young European man is found on a Chinese countryside riverbank, naked, and seemingly unable (or unwilling) to communicate.  He is taken to a hospital, where no physical reason for his silence is found, and it is decided to send him to a mental asylum.  Jiang, n orderly at the hospital, senses that the patient isn't crazy but just troubled, and takes off with the young man, hoping to get him to open up about his past.  One clue comes when Jiang spots him calling a young Chinese woman on his cell phone, just to hear her voice.  Looking into their relationship, Jiang eventually discovers the devastating event that apparently caused him to withdraw from life.This 2012 feature is an excellent  suspense-filled story, with capable acting and direction, definitely worth a look.  Has been featured at several international film festivals.  DVD dialogue is in Mandarin with English subtitles, with extras including an interview with director Simon Chung.  Not rated, but would be a solid R for nudity and simulated sexual activity.  Four stars out of five.",4,Excellent suspenseful film is worth a look.,1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,1074,"['unidentified', 'young', 'European', 'man', 'found', 'Chinese', 'countryside', 'riverbank', 'naked', 'seemingly', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'communicate', 'taken', 'hospital', 'where', 'physical', 'reason', 'silence', 'found', 'decided', 'send', 'mental', 'asylum', 'Jiang', 'n', 'orderly', 'hospital', 'patient', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'just', 'troubled', 'off', 'young', 'man', 'hoping', 'get', 'open', 'up', 'past', 'One', 'clue', 'when', 'Jiang', 'spots', 'calling', 'young', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'cell', 'phone', 'just', 'hear', 'voice', 'Looking', 'relationship', 'Jiang', 'eventually', 'devastating', 'event', 'apparently', 'caused', 'withdraw', 'life.This', '2012', 'feature', 'excellent', 'suspense-filled', 'story', 'capable', 'acting', 'direction', 'definitely', 'look', 'Has', 'been', 'featured', 'several', 'international', 'film', 'festivals', 'DVD', 'dialogue', 'Mandarin', 'English', 'subtitles', 'extras', 'including', 'interview', 'director', 'Simon', 'Chung', 'Not', 'rated', 'would', 'be', 'solid', 'R', 'nudity', 'simulated', 'sexual', 'activity', 'Four', 'five']",Speechless

1589615,A2SIBFTMWJY6ZS,B0099PW0D2,John C. Marshell Jr.,"[8, 9]","This film lacks a certain polish and luster.  While mildly entertaining and captivating, I never really got caught up in the narrative.  The pacing of the film is a little too slow and never seems to pick up steam when it should.  Usually a suspense film has a point when loose strands of the narrative are drawn together and the hidden elements of the plot revealed.  The film's pace picks up and so do the emotions of the viewer as the dialectic of mystery graduates to revelation and the story becomes complete. This emotional elevation never really happens in the film.  Though the story is believable and the ending logical, mediocre writing and gaps in the plot, which an alert viewer can bridge, slow down the action producing a lethargy in the viewing experience.  The intrigues in the characters' relations is what drive the suspense, but the director uses largely inexperienced actors who never seem to create the necessary tension between themselves, and his choice of an oddly saccharine tone for a tragedy does not lace the ending with a sense of justice.  Instead, he supplies a bittersweet ending that admonishes hope for the lovelorn.  ""Speechless"" seems to me caught between a film noir and a coming-of-age drama.In an online interview, the director states he did not have official permission from the Chinese authorities to make this film.  Some scenes where filmed ""underground"" and this no doubt contributed to diminishing what could have been a good movie.  However, it is well worth watching.  Another reviewer on this page recommends renting.  Good advice.",3,"Not a suspense thriller, but low key intrigue",1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,1579,"['film', 'certain', 'polish', 'luster', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'captivating', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'narrative', 'pacing', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'slow', 'never', 'pick', 'up', 'steam', 'when', 'should', 'Usually', 'suspense', 'film', 'point', 'when', 'loose', 'strands', 'narrative', 'are', 'drawn', 'together', 'hidden', 'elements', 'plot', 'revealed', 'film', 'pace', 'up', 'so', 'do', 'emotions', 'viewer', 'dialectic', 'mystery', 'graduates', 'revelation', 'story', 'complete', 'emotional', 'elevation', 'never', 'really', 'film', 'story', 'believable', 'ending', 'logical', 'mediocre', 'writing', 'gaps', 'plot', 'alert', 'viewer', 'can', 'bridge', 'slow', 'down', 'action', 'producing', 'lethargy', 'viewing', 'experience', 'intrigues', 'characters', 'relations', 'what', 'drive', 'suspense', 'director', 'largely', 'inexperienced', 'actors', 'who', 'never', 'seem', 'create', 'necessary', 'tension', 'choice', 'oddly', 'saccharine', 'tone', 'tragedy', 'not', 'lace', 'ending', 'sense', 'justice', 'Instead', 'bittersweet', 'ending', 'admonishes', 'hope', 'lovelorn', 'Speechless', 'caught', 'film', 'noir', 'coming-of-age', 'drama.In', 'online', 'interview', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'official', 'permission', 'Chinese', 'authorities', 'make', 'film', 'scenes', 'where', 'filmed', 'underground', 'doubt', 'contributed', 'diminishing', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'However', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'reviewer', 'page', 'renting', 'Good', 'advice']",Speechless

1589618,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B0099PW0D2,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","This is an independent gay film from Simon Chung, it tells the story of a man found swimming naked in a river by the police. He is either unable or unwilling to speak. So after some controversial `questioning', they decide to take him to the local hospital. There his nurse Jiang, takes more than a professional interest in him. So when it is decided to transfer him to a mental institution he helps him get away.Then they come across a woman who this man actually knows and the plot starts to develop. We then have the real story of Frenchman Luc, told in flash back. This was one of those films that took a while to get going; the pacing was almost lethargic at one point. The acting is just about credible and with a cast of unknowns and a shoe string budget there were always going to be issues, and they are all too apparent at times especially with some of the sets. I was on the verge of giving up about half way through, but then things did start to happen.The plot twists at the end are to be expected but they were not entirely foreseeable, which dragged this from being ok to nearly good. I would have given this 3.5 stars, but am rounding up to be generous. It is in Mandarin and a little English which was strange as he is supposed to be French and runs to ninety two minutes which could have been shorter, but all in all not a bad effort. This is one that trades on the plot surprises so not one to keep per se. Also there is next to no bedroom action either - so my advice would be go for a rental option as indeed did I.",4,Chinese Story of man with a past,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,1536,"['independent', 'gay', 'film', 'Simon', 'Chung', 'story', 'man', 'found', 'swimming', 'naked', 'river', 'police', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'speak', 'So', 'controversial', 'questioning', 'decide', 'take', 'local', 'hospital', 'nurse', 'Jiang', 'more', 'professional', 'interest', 'So', 'when', 'decided', 'transfer', 'mental', 'institution', 'get', 'come', 'woman', 'who', 'man', 'actually', 'plot', 'develop', 'then', 'have', 'real', 'story', 'Frenchman', 'Luc', 'told', 'flash', 'back', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'going', 'pacing', 'was', 'almost', 'lethargic', 'one', 'point', 'acting', 'just', 'credible', 'cast', 'unknowns', 'shoe', 'string', 'budget', 'were', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'issues', 'are', 'too', 'apparent', 'times', 'especially', 'sets', 'was', 'verge', 'giving', 'up', 'way', 'then', 'things', 'did', 'start', 'happen.The', 'plot', 'twists', 'end', 'are', 'be', 'expected', 'were', 'not', 'entirely', 'foreseeable', 'dragged', 'being', 'ok', 'nearly', 'good', 'would', 'have', 'given', '3.5', 'stars', 'am', 'rounding', 'up', 'be', 'generous', 'Mandarin', 'little', 'English', 'was', 'strange', 'supposed', 'be', 'French', 'ninety', 'two', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shorter', 'not', 'bad', 'effort', 'one', 'plot', 'surprises', 'so', 'not', 'one', 'keep', 'se', 'Also', 'next', 'bedroom', 'action', 'so', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'go', 'rental', 'option', 'indeed', 'did']",Speechless
