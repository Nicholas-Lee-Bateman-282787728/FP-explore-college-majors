When this popped up in my netflix recommendations, I jumped at the chance to watch it. After all, the first two seasons were so awesome.Unfortunately this just isn't up to the par of the first two seasons. The jokes aren't as fresh as they used to be & while Jenny McCarthy does her best to try to fill the shoes of her predecessors, she just isn't really all that great. She lacks the warmth or energy of the previous four actresses who have voiced her. If she had been the first to voice Six then perhaps it'd be different, but after hearing Terry Farrell & Gina Gershon's voices it's hard to hear McCarthy in this role. The animation is another thing that seems to lack, but I'm not sure if that's because of the 3 years that's passed since the third season aired or because the animation quality has decreased since season 2. (I just started re-watching the previous two seasons & there is a difference in animation quality.)The set is still enjoyable enough to watch & I recommend it to fans of the previous seasons, but if you've never seen the show before then I recommend you start with the first two seasons. This wasn't bad, but it's just weak in comparison to what has come before.Oh, and if you've seen the movie then you should be aware that the movie pretty much took several episodes from this season (some of the best ones), threw some new animation in, & slapped a movie label on it. To be fair, the movie version was brought over before there were even plans to release season 3 on DVD in the states, which might have been the reason for its creation. (The movie, not the season 3 DVDs.)",3,Didn't age well & isn't as good as the previous 2 seasons...,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,1695,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'show', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'When', 'popped', 'up', 'netflix', 'recommendations', 'jumped', 'chance', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'so', 'awesome.Unfortunately', 'just', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'fresh', 'used', 'be', 'Jenny', 'McCarthy', 'best', 'try', 'fill', 'shoes', 'predecessors', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'great', 'warmth', 'energy', 'previous', 'four', 'actresses', 'who', 'have', 'voiced', 'had', 'been', 'first', 'voice', 'Six', 'then', 'perhaps', ""'d"", 'be', 'different', 'hearing', 'Terry', 'Farrell', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'voices', 'hard', 'hear', 'McCarthy', 'role', 'animation', 'thing', 'lack', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', '3', 'years', 'passed', 'third', 'season', 'aired', 'animation', 'quality', 'decreased', 'season', '2', 'just', 'started', 're-watching', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'difference', 'animation', 'quality', 'set', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'watch', 'recommend', 'fans', 'previous', 'seasons', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'then', 'recommend', 'start', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'weak', 'comparison', 'what', 'come', 'before.Oh', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'took', 'several', 'episodes', 'season', 'best', 'ones', 'threw', 'new', 'animation', 'slapped', 'movie', 'label', 'be', 'fair', 'movie', 'version', 'was', 'brought', 'over', 'were', 'even', 'plans', 'release', 'season', '3', 'DVD', 'states', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'reason', 'creation', 'movie', 'not', 'season', '3', 'DVDs']",N/A
