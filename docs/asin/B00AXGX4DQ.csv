1618300,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B00AXGX4DQ,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[1, 2]","In 1979 West Hollywood, a newly divorced man, Paul (Garret Dillahunt), is reconciling his sexuality, and meets drag performer Rudy (Alan Cumming). Before their relationship can fully develop, a third party is added:  Marco, a 14 year old boy with Down Syndrome, who is abandoned when his single mother (Rudy's neighbor) is arrested for prostitution.  Marco's mother agrees to name Rudy and Paul as temporary guardians, and they become a happy family ... for a while.  A homophobic co-worker of Paul's challenges Marco's safety with the couple, and that sets off a dramatic court case, all too realistic for its time.  They argue that the primary consideration should be what is best for Marco, not whether Rudy sings in drag or Paul was not honest with his boss about his relationship.  .This is an extremely emotional, dramatic telling of a situation that, to some extent, would still occur today in many cities.  It also redefines what makes up a ""family,"" with Dillahunt's character showing the most personal growth as a self-assured, proud gay man.  There are also many scenes stolen by Isaac Leyva, who played Marco.  The film won several audience awards at film festivals, and was a finalist for a GLAAD Media Award. A little slow in places, and I thought the blues singing was overdone a bit, but the positives balance out all that, for a full five stars out of five.PS:  Most of the other reviews I have read mention the couple was trying to ""adopt"" the boy.  This is not the case.

In &#34;Any Day Now&#34;, Alan Cumming plays Rudy, an over-the-top character, a drag performer at a gay bar in 1979 Los Angeles. In true &#34;we-only-have-90-minutes-to-tell-this-story&#34; fashion, things happen a little too quickly as Rudy meets a just-peeking-out-of-the-closet lawyer; then takes in a boy from next door who has Downs Syndrome and whose addict/prostitute mother has just been put in jail; and then moves in with the lawyer so that they can apply for legal custody of the boy.  The remainder of the movie is an indictment of the injustice of the legal system in dealing with caregivers who happen to be gay, putting personal prejudices ahead of the needs of the child.  The entire cast is noteworthy.  Sure, it would have been better if there had been a bit more time for plot development before diving head first into this personal crisis, straining credibility a bit.

Alan Cumming is saddled with what appears to be a $12.99 mail-order job made of horse hair.  It's a shapeless shoulder-length monstrosity, with no pretence to layering or blow-waving, and, as such, not remotely believable on a character who is a prissy, drag artiste with legitimate showbiz ambitions.  It remains rigid and lifeless throughout, in stark contrast to Cumming's histrionic performance, which frequently brings to mind Bette Davis in Beyond The Forest (in which she sported a similarly tragic coiffure).  Even more inexplicable is Garret Dillahunt's deathly do, which has a parting that screams TOUPEE, even from a distance.  The director goes to conspicuous lengths to frame it out of shots and shoot it from forgiving angles, but nothing can hide its awfulness.  According to Google Images, Dillahunt has quite a nice head of hair, so why he's wearing a wig that doesn't even pretend evoke the 1970s remains a mystery.  Distressing as all of this is, by about the two-thirds mark I'd just about willed enough suspension of disbelief to concentrate on the story.

1618309,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B00AXGX4DQ,J. Martin,"[1, 5]","**** THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ****If I cared about my reviewer ranking (I don't), I'd never review a movie like Any Day Now. So many people love it so adamantly that they can't help attacking anybody who doesn't.Although he plays an interesting character, Alan Cumming's performance is so over-the-top that he is never believable; and since the whole movie hangs on his performance, the whole movie is a failure.I never for one second forgot that I was watching Alan Cumming act, never for one second related to Rudy Donatello as a real person or cared about what he cared about. In that regard, Garret Dillahunt's Paul was much better. I did believe in and care about him, but it wasn't enough.I never for one second even believed Rudy was gay (even though Cumming is) or that he cared a bean about Marco or Paul or anybody else but his own obnoxious drama-queen self. Marco was a prop to him, not a person; Marco was just a pawn in Rudy's egomaniacal drive to right society's injustice against himself.Willing suspension of disbelief is one thing, and I do it all the time when watching movies; but trying to FORCE myself to believe something when everything in me constantly screams ""Fake!"" is more than I demand of myself.The atrocious wigs that sat atop Cumming's and Dillahunt's heads throughout the movie, and Cumming's shrill and embarrassingly bad New York accent, were persistent and unnecessary distractions that did not help the movie's credibility. Movies are for entertainment; if they don't entertain, they fail. The failure is theirs, not mine.I agree completely with a review on another site that starts ""The message is admirable, but the vehicle is a clunker."" The legal rejection of gays as adoptive parents is an indefensible injustice that must and will be corrected. This movie not only completely fails to advance that cause, but it sets that cause back. That's inexcusable.Gay couples deserve better than this movie. It makes a strong case for NOT letting gays adopt, because the gay in this case is a narcissistic, hysterical, totally self-absorbed nut like Rudy Donatello, unfit to adopt ANY child, especially one like Marco who needs constant, self-sacrificing attention. Rudy's total unfitness to adopt a child has nothing to do with his being gay; it has to do with his unstable, totally self-centered personality.Near the movie's end - just in case we'd somehow missed the point that the tragedy was about HIM, not about Marco - Rudy grinds out a truly cringe-inducing rendition of Bob Dylan's hymn-like ""I Shall Be Released"", tears and sweat streaming down his face. His rampant, crippling narcissism is appalling.Saying that Any Day Now is based on ""a true story"" is no excuse. The writer-director Travis Fine chose what to include and leave out, what to emphasize and tone down. The movie is his responsibility; he was not forced by ""facts"" to make it as he did.If Fine's intention was to advance the cause of gay adoption, his hero should have been fit to parent a disabled child, so that the law's rejection of him could be seen as truly biased and unjust. Rudy - THIS Rudy - was NOT fit to parent such a child, or any child. I am proudly and militantly gay, but I kept hoping for Marco's sake that the courts would not give Rudy custody of him.I doubt that's the point Fine intended to make when he wrote and directed this movie, but it's the point he did make. Thank God the future of gay rights doesn't depend on this movie, or we'd all be back in the closet with the door locked and our guns loaded.",2,Great intentions; terrible execution,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,3546,"['****', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'MAY', 'CONTAIN', 'SPOILERS', '****If', 'cared', 'reviewer', 'ranking', 'do', ""n't"", ""'d"", 'never', 'review', 'movie', 'Day', 'Now', 'So', 'many', 'people', 'love', 'so', 'adamantly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'attacking', 'anybody', 'who', 'interesting', 'character', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'performance', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'never', 'believable', 'whole', 'movie', 'hangs', 'performance', 'whole', 'movie', 'failure.I', 'never', 'one', 'second', 'forgot', 'was', 'watching', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'act', 'never', 'one', 'second', 'related', 'Rudy', 'Donatello', 'real', 'person', 'cared', 'what', 'cared', 'about', 'regard', 'Garret', 'Dillahunt', 'Paul', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'did', 'believe', 'care', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough.I', 'never', 'one', 'second', 'even', 'believed', 'Rudy', 'was', 'gay', 'even', 'Cumming', 'cared', 'bean', 'Marco', 'Paul', 'anybody', 'else', 'own', 'obnoxious', 'drama-queen', 'self', 'Marco', 'was', 'prop', 'not', 'person', 'Marco', 'was', 'just', 'pawn', 'Rudy', 'egomaniacal', 'drive', 'right', 'society', 'injustice', 'himself.Willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'one', 'thing', 'do', 'time', 'when', 'watching', 'movies', 'trying', 'FORCE', 'believe', 'something', 'when', 'everything', 'constantly', 'Fake', 'more', 'demand', 'myself.The', 'atrocious', 'wigs', 'sat', 'Cumming', 'Dillahunt', 'heads', 'movie', 'Cumming', 'shrill', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'New', 'York', 'accent', 'were', 'persistent', 'unnecessary', 'distractions', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'movie', 'credibility', 'Movies', 'are', 'entertainment', 'do', ""n't"", 'entertain', 'fail', 'failure', 'theirs', 'not', 'mine.I', 'agree', 'completely', 'review', 'site', 'message', 'admirable', 'vehicle', 'clunker', 'legal', 'rejection', 'gays', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'indefensible', 'injustice', 'must', 'will', 'be', 'corrected', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'completely', 'advance', 'cause', 'cause', 'back', 'inexcusable.Gay', 'couples', 'deserve', 'better', 'movie', 'strong', 'case', 'NOT', 'letting', 'gays', 'adopt', 'gay', 'case', 'narcissistic', 'hysterical', 'totally', 'self-absorbed', 'nut', 'Rudy', 'Donatello', 'unfit', 'adopt', 'ANY', 'child', 'especially', 'one', 'Marco', 'who', 'constant', 'self-sacrificing', 'attention', 'Rudy', 'total', 'unfitness', 'adopt', 'child', 'nothing', 'do', 'being', 'gay', 'do', 'unstable', 'totally', 'self-centered', 'movie', 'end', 'just', 'case', ""'d"", 'somehow', 'missed', 'point', 'tragedy', 'was', 'HIM', 'not', 'Marco', 'Rudy', 'out', 'truly', 'cringe-inducing', 'rendition', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'hymn-like', 'Shall', 'Be', 'Released', 'tears', 'sweat', 'streaming', 'down', 'face', 'rampant', 'crippling', 'narcissism', 'appalling.Saying', 'Day', 'Now', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'excuse', 'writer-director', 'Travis', 'Fine', 'chose', 'what', 'include', 'leave', 'out', 'what', 'emphasize', 'tone', 'down', 'movie', 'responsibility', 'was', 'not', 'forced', 'facts', 'make', 'Fine', 'intention', 'was', 'advance', 'cause', 'gay', 'adoption', 'hero', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fit', 'parent', 'disabled', 'child', 'law', 'rejection', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'truly', 'biased', 'unjust', 'Rudy', 'THIS', 'Rudy', 'was', 'NOT', 'fit', 'parent', 'child', 'child', 'am', 'proudly', 'militantly', 'gay', 'kept', 'hoping', 'Marco', 'sake', 'courts', 'would', 'not', 'give', 'Rudy', 'custody', 'him.I', 'doubt', 'point', 'Fine', 'intended', 'make', 'when', 'wrote', 'directed', 'movie', 'point', 'did', 'make', 'Thank', 'God', 'future', 'gay', 'rights', ""n't"", 'depend', 'movie', ""'d"", 'be', 'back', 'closet', 'door', 'locked', 'guns', 'loaded']",N/A

Alan Cumming was crazy good in it, but all the acting was really good.  I like the way they told the story too, nothing gratuitous, just a glimpse into the life of this couple wanting to give a child with Down Syndrome a good life and the obstacles and discrimination they face in doing that.  This was set in 1979 and what it left me thinking about is 1) what else can I watch Alan Cumming in and 2) as a society we haven't come as far from this mind set as we like to think we have.",4,"Movie about finding love, fighting for what's right, facing discrimination",1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,606,"['really', 'liked', 'movie', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'stayed', 'where', ""'m"", 'still', 'thinking', 'today', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'was', 'crazy', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'way', 'told', 'story', 'too', 'nothing', 'gratuitous', 'just', 'glimpse', 'life', 'couple', 'wanting', 'give', 'child', 'Down', 'Syndrome', 'good', 'life', 'obstacles', 'discrimination', 'face', 'doing', 'was', 'set', '1979', 'what', 'left', 'thinking', 'about', '1', 'what', 'else', 'can', 'watch', 'Alan', 'Cumming', '2', 'society', 'have', ""n't"", 'come', 'far', 'mind', 'set', 'like', 'think', 'have']",N/A

Glad to see this now finally has a DVD release date.""Any Day Now"" (2012 release; 94 min.) brings the story of Rudy (played by Alan Cumming) and Paul (played by Garret Dillahunt), how they meet in California in 1979, and fall in love. Rudy comes to care for his neighbor's teengage boy with Down syndrome (Marco, played by Isaac Leyva), as Marco's mom is a drug addict and in any event doesn't care for Marco one bit. Eventually Rudy wants to adopt Marco and Paul (an attorney) tries to build a legal case for it. This of course creates all kinds of problems, as the justice system is not designed/prepared for a gay couple to adopt. To give away more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience so you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out, although I will just say that I did not see the end coming AT ALL.Several comments: first, while this movie is about a gay couple, please don't call it 'a movie about gays', as ""Any Day Now"" simply uses these circumstances to showcase the absurdities and shortcomings in the California legal system of 30 years ago. Second, Alan Cumming gives a brilliant performance as Rudy, and confirms yet again what an enormous talent he is (watch him sing ""I Shall Be Released""!). Third, the movie is a great time capsule of the late 70s/early 80s, with remarkable attention to the visual details of those times. Last but certainly not least, the 'disco' soundtrack to this movie is a lot of fun, I heard songs I had not listened to in many, many years and while there are a couple of disco staples (Marty Balin's ""Miracles"" and Thelma Houston's ""Don't Leave Me This Way""), there are a lot of other less obvious nuggets as well such as France Joli's ""Come To Me"" and Betty Padgett ""It Would Be a Shame"". The closing credits bring a brand new song from Rufus Wrainwright, a very nice ""Metaphorical Blanket"".  Bottom line, this is one of those ""little"" movies that could, and I far more enjoyed this movie than I thought I would. ""Any Day Now"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,Touching family drama,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,2099,"['saw', 'movie', 'month', 'ago', 'Landmark', 'E', 'Street', 'Cinema', 'Washington', 'DC', 'Glad', 'see', 'now', 'finally', 'DVD', 'release', 'date', 'Day', 'Now', '2012', 'release', '94', 'min', 'story', 'Rudy', 'played', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'Paul', 'played', 'Garret', 'Dillahunt', 'how', 'meet', 'California', '1979', 'fall', 'love', 'Rudy', 'care', 'neighbor', 'teengage', 'boy', 'Down', 'syndrome', 'Marco', 'played', 'Isaac', 'Leyva', 'Marco', 'mom', 'drug', 'addict', 'event', ""n't"", 'care', 'Marco', 'one', 'bit', 'Eventually', 'Rudy', 'adopt', 'Marco', 'Paul', 'attorney', 'build', 'legal', 'case', 'course', 'kinds', 'problems', 'justice', 'system', 'not', 'designed/prepared', 'gay', 'couple', 'adopt', 'give', 'away', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'end', 'coming', 'AT', 'ALL.Several', 'comments', 'first', 'movie', 'gay', 'couple', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'movie', 'gays', 'Day', 'Now', 'simply', 'circumstances', 'showcase', 'absurdities', 'shortcomings', 'California', 'legal', 'system', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'Second', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Rudy', 'yet', 'again', 'what', 'enormous', 'talent', 'watch', 'sing', 'Shall', 'Be', 'Released', 'Third', 'movie', 'great', 'time', 'capsule', 'late', '70s/early', '80s', 'remarkable', 'attention', 'visual', 'details', 'times', 'Last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', ""'disco"", 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'heard', 'songs', 'had', 'not', 'listened', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'are', 'couple', 'disco', 'staples', 'Marty', 'Balin', 'Miracles', 'Thelma', 'Houston', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Leave', 'Me', 'Way', 'are', 'lot', 'other', 'less', 'obvious', 'nuggets', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'France', 'Joli', 'Come', 'Me', 'Betty', 'Padgett', 'Would', 'Be', 'Shame', 'closing', 'credits', 'bring', 'brand', 'new', 'song', 'Rufus', 'Wrainwright', 'very', 'nice', 'Metaphorical', 'Blanket', 'Bottom', 'line', 'one', 'little', 'movies', 'could', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'Day', 'Now', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

While on the job at Fabio's he meets Paul (Garret Dillahunt) a man who looks like Jon Voight out of ""Midnight Cowboy."" They become an item. Rudy lives in a run down apartment next to a coke-prostitute named Marianna (Jamie Anne Allman). She has a son, Marco (Isaac Leyva). Marco has Down Syndrome and Marianna is a terrible mother.When Marianna gets busted for prostitution and drugs, Rudy cares for the child in order to keep him out of a foster home. Paul joins the family as they become the emergency legal guardians of Marco. When Paul's lifestyle becomes exposed, prejudices abound and lives change dramatically.The film is well acted. The action moves slow, but steady. The film contrasts the gay care free disco music of the era to the angst of our gay couple. Make no mistake about it, this is a pro gay adoption movie. I am sure this film will convince anyone that we need to allow gay couples to adopt kids with Down Syndrome nobody else wants...and as the title suggests, 14th amendment equality will come any day now.Parental Guidance: F-bomb. no nudity.
