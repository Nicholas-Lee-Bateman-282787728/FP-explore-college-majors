904671,A23L2BR07AOBG1,B0009F43DG,alex bushman,"[6, 15]","This show boasts a rawer approach to the the teen high school genre, it comes close to actually showing sex and has no problem going into the minds of the males that would fornicate with just about any pretty girl that would have them.Life as we know it does some things that are good, but ruins them somewhat by not truly committing to the serious, everyday concerns.  The things it presents that are commendable include: parental separation, divorce, starting over, monetary responsibility etc.  It's as immature as you would expect and in some ways the way it deals with these issues sometimes better than I expected. One of the best things about the show are the non-photogenic uncool people just coming up and talking to these guys and pretending like they're friends, it's priceless when it happens and it's almost a bad thing since it raises the question of do these guys only talk to people when the script requires them to be extroverted outside of their close knit of friends.  Furthermore, I feel the constant asides the three main characters make are unnecessary and ruin the raw sexual feel and immature character of the show by making these characters actions somehow seem more wholesome and likeable when they're not.  That is my opinion and I know that people disagree, but my vote is that the gimmmick is one of the things dragging the show into not being as good as it could be.The show doesn't truly take any of the romantic relationships seriously which is why show feels like it's going to fast and doesn't stop to really appreciate the nitty gritty details of what a raw depiction of teenage life should be.  Ben's relationship in the beginning happens way too fast to be believable (even if it does happen that way in real life) and Dino's troubles with Jackie are just too grievous for it to be possible for them to be any more than friends from that point on. More importantly (and confusingly) the show both does, and doesn't get how to portray the family unit.  While Sue's family works wonderfully, as portrayed, Jackie's, Jonathan's, and Ben's don't have enough time to build.  It's the worst off in Jackies situation especially with her father being a drunk, we can't truly feel sorry for her if we don't really see what her life could be if he wasn't a drunk.  Although that's bad, the tragic thing is about Ben's family because he has a wonderful cast to portray them and Ben himself is the best performance of the show. Dylan Baker and Betsy Ann Baker (from Freaks and Geeks) are always good, but just feel tacked on most of the time so that when the episode comes where they have a serious conflict with Ben you feel like you don't really know them and here's where it becomes obvious that when it comes to shows about the youth experience, there's the men and the boys.  Freaks and Geeks is the man because it never really had to justify why it would spend an episode with the parents as a strong storyline because the storyline was so well written and in this series you don't really feel (I didn't) that there was a storyline, just ideas that never really came together and the writers expected the audience not to recognize this because of the good looking actors and the constant asides to them.  This is discouraging since some of the same producers from Freaks and Geeks worked on this show and a number of the cast members who pop up on the show were from Freak and Geeks, as well as other quality entertainments.  It's strange when this happens because the show almost doesn't know what to do with them due to the fact the show isn't about them, but they're clearly better than the show they're on. Even the main characters seem lost when this happens, like when the three protagonists get the new job at the wilderness store.  The only time the character acting role integrates itself is when Peter Dinklage plays the counselor.  It feels just right and makes the characters truly work to become real.As a whole, I don't recommend it to people who are fans of Freaks and Geeks, a truly well-made series, but since this series is better than many series that remain on the air, I recommend it to people who believe that TV on DVD is stupid and unnecessary, I do believe this series deserves an audience on DVD, despite my objections, because Disney makes entertainment for mass audiences and families and I think there's something for the teenager, broken family, or even the cocky kid who looks like Tom Cruise who never got over himself in high school. Plus, there's tons of eye candy for the people who don't watch it for the story development (probably a lot more than I would care to guess).",2,"Not bad, but not exactly good either",1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,4639,"['show', 'rawer', 'approach', 'teen', 'high', 'school', 'genre', 'close', 'actually', 'showing', 'sex', 'problem', 'going', 'minds', 'males', 'would', 'fornicate', 'just', 'pretty', 'girl', 'would', 'have', 'them.Life', 'know', 'things', 'are', 'good', 'somewhat', 'not', 'truly', 'committing', 'serious', 'everyday', 'concerns', 'things', 'are', 'commendable', 'include', 'parental', 'separation', 'divorce', 'starting', 'over', 'monetary', 'responsibility', 'etc', 'as', 'immature', 'would', 'expect', 'ways', 'way', 'issues', 'sometimes', 'better', 'expected', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'show', 'are', 'non-photogenic', 'uncool', 'people', 'just', 'coming', 'up', 'talking', 'guys', 'pretending', ""'re"", 'friends', 'priceless', 'when', 'almost', 'bad', 'thing', 'question', 'do', 'guys', 'only', 'talk', 'people', 'when', 'script', 'be', 'extroverted', 'close', 'knit', 'friends', 'Furthermore', 'feel', 'constant', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'make', 'are', 'unnecessary', 'ruin', 'raw', 'sexual', 'feel', 'immature', 'character', 'show', 'making', 'characters', 'actions', 'somehow', 'seem', 'more', 'wholesome', 'likeable', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'opinion', 'know', 'people', 'disagree', 'vote', 'gimmmick', 'one', 'things', 'dragging', 'show', 'not', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be.The', 'show', ""n't"", 'truly', 'take', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'seriously', 'why', 'show', 'feels', 'going', 'fast', ""n't"", 'stop', 'really', 'appreciate', 'nitty', 'gritty', 'details', 'what', 'raw', 'depiction', 'teenage', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'Ben', 'relationship', 'beginning', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'be', 'believable', 'even', 'happen', 'way', 'real', 'life', 'Dino', 'troubles', 'Jackie', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'grievous', 'be', 'possible', 'be', 'more', 'friends', 'point', 'More', 'importantly', 'confusingly', 'show', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'portray', 'family', 'unit', 'Sue', 'family', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'Jackie', 'Jonathan', 'Ben', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'time', 'build', 'worst', 'off', 'Jackies', 'situation', 'especially', 'father', 'being', 'drunk', 'ca', ""n't"", 'truly', 'feel', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'what', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'was', ""n't"", 'drunk', 'bad', 'tragic', 'thing', 'Ben', 'family', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'portray', 'Ben', 'best', 'performance', 'show', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'Betsy', 'Ann', 'Baker', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'are', 'always', 'good', 'just', 'feel', 'tacked', 'most', 'time', 'so', 'when', 'episode', 'where', 'have', 'serious', 'conflict', 'Ben', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'here', 'where', 'obvious', 'when', 'shows', 'youth', 'experience', 'men', 'boys', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'man', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'justify', 'why', 'would', 'spend', 'episode', 'parents', 'strong', 'storyline', 'storyline', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'storyline', 'just', 'ideas', 'never', 'really', 'came', 'together', 'writers', 'expected', 'audience', 'not', 'recognize', 'good', 'looking', 'actors', 'constant', 'asides', 'discouraging', 'same', 'producers', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'worked', 'show', 'number', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'pop', 'up', 'show', 'were', 'Freak', 'Geeks', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'quality', 'entertainments', 'strange', 'when', 'show', 'almost', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'due', 'fact', 'show', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'clearly', 'better', 'show', ""'re"", 'Even', 'main', 'characters', 'seem', 'lost', 'when', 'when', 'three', 'protagonists', 'get', 'new', 'job', 'wilderness', 'store', 'only', 'time', 'character', 'acting', 'role', 'integrates', 'when', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'counselor', 'just', 'right', 'characters', 'truly', 'work', 'become', 'real.As', 'whole', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'truly', 'well-made', 'series', 'series', 'better', 'many', 'series', 'remain', 'air', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'TV', 'DVD', 'stupid', 'unnecessary', 'do', 'believe', 'series', 'audience', 'DVD', 'objections', 'Disney', 'entertainment', 'mass', 'audiences', 'families', 'think', 'something', 'teenager', 'broken', 'family', 'even', 'cocky', 'kid', 'who', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'high', 'school', 'tons', 'eye', 'candy', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'story', 'development', 'probably', 'lot', 'more', 'would', 'care', 'guess']",Life As We Know It - The Complete Series

904674,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B0009F43DG,Dorrie Wheeler,"[26, 28]","This is really, really the best teen coming of age series I have seen in ages.  ""Life As We Know It,"" is another series produced by the producers of ""Freaks and Geeks.""  They really got it right with this show but unfortunately like ""Freaks and Geeks,"" and ""Undeclared,"" ""Life As We Know It,"" only lasted one season and on top of that ABC didn't even air the final two episodes of the show.  ""Life As We Know It,"" is about three male high school best friends.  Dino is the very popular one, at least that is how it seems.  He is very handsome and looks like a young Tom Cruise. His life isn't perfect though.  He has a girlfriend who he wants to have sex with and he is taken aback when he finds out his mother is having an affair with his coach.  Ben, I'm guessing is the nerd.  He has a major crush on his young teacher.  She pushes things to the limit flirting back and taking chances with her career it seems. Jonathan is the third friend.  In the pilot episode his relationship with the character portrayed by Kelly Osbourne takes off.  Her weight is a written into the storyline as Jonathan has qualms about dating a ""big girl."" In another twist, the three girl characters in the show who are tied to the girls also happen to be friends and can be seen talking in various scenes.  I like the way the show is written as in certain cut screens the main characters talk to the audience.  It's a great show, it's hip, it's fly and manages to have the right blend of comedy and drama.  The kids seem more mature than the Canadian gang on ""Degrassi The Next Generation,"" and they seem more authentic and everyday like than the gang on ""90210"" or ""The OC."" It's a great show that didn't last.  The DVD box set is very slim and features 3 colorful DVDs.  The bonus features include two never before episodes (total episodes on the set is 13), audio commentaries, Life as We Blow It (outakes), deleted scenes and producers photo gallery. Dino's parents get a good amount of screen time but not enough to make younger viewers lose interest.  If you didn't catch this show during it's original run you might want to pick up the DVD box set. It's a really great show that hopefully will come back.",5,"Smart, Witty, an A++ New Millennium Teen Series",1125532800,"09 1, 2005",2005,2191,"['really', 'really', 'best', 'teen', 'coming', 'age', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'ages', 'Life', 'Know', 'series', 'produced', 'producers', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'really', 'got', 'right', 'show', 'unfortunately', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'Undeclared', 'Life', 'Know', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'top', 'ABC', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'air', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'show', 'Life', 'Know', 'three', 'male', 'high', 'school', 'best', 'friends', 'Dino', 'very', 'popular', 'one', 'least', 'how', 'very', 'handsome', 'young', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'life', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'have', 'sex', 'taken', 'aback', 'when', 'out', 'mother', 'having', 'affair', 'coach', 'Ben', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'nerd', 'major', 'crush', 'young', 'teacher', 'things', 'limit', 'flirting', 'back', 'taking', 'chances', 'career', 'Jonathan', 'third', 'friend', 'pilot', 'episode', 'relationship', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Kelly', 'Osbourne', 'off', 'weight', 'written', 'storyline', 'Jonathan', 'qualms', 'dating', 'big', 'girl', 'twist', 'three', 'girl', 'characters', 'show', 'who', 'are', 'tied', 'girls', 'also', 'happen', 'be', 'friends', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'talking', 'various', 'scenes', 'way', 'show', 'written', 'certain', 'cut', 'main', 'characters', 'talk', 'audience', 'great', 'show', 'hip', 'fly', 'manages', 'have', 'right', 'blend', 'comedy', 'drama', 'kids', 'seem', 'more', 'mature', 'Canadian', 'gang', 'Degrassi', 'Next', 'Generation', 'seem', 'more', 'authentic', 'gang', '90210', 'OC', 'great', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'very', 'slim', '3', 'colorful', 'DVDs', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'two', 'never', 'episodes', 'total', 'episodes', 'set', '13', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'Life', 'Blow', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'producers', 'photo', 'gallery', 'Dino', 'parents', 'get', 'good', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'younger', 'viewers', 'lose', 'interest', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'show', 'original', 'run', 'might', 'want', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'really', 'great', 'show', 'hopefully', 'will', 'come', 'back']",Life As We Know It - The Complete Series

With producers from ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""My So Called Life,"" LAWKI was a realistic look on what it is like to be a teenage boy in high school right now.  Guys watched it because the main male characters were always having a crisis that comes right out of any high school in america (thats probably why many guys at my school watched it, but never told anyone).  And Girls enjoyed it because although the main characters are the three guys, there are three extremly charming and intelligent girls that help make up the cast.Eventhough many critics enjoyed the show, the show still had many problems facing it.  The show was based on the English novel ""doing it"" and which you can guess from the title was very frank and had more sexual stuff in it than your normal teen fair.  The show (although toned down a little) still keeps that prospective of teenagers, and sicne was bashed by the FCC (in post-Janet Jackson days and several Parent groups).Since I had previously read the book I was extremly excited when I first heard about this show.  When the pilot aired surprisingly enough I was not dissapointed, the show took the essance of the book, added a few american twists and ran with it.  Although the ratings never went higher than 5 million viewers, the show quickly became my favorite show on the air.The show is about three teenage boys who happen to be best friends (one is a Jock, one is a Nerd, and the Other just exsist).  All three of these boys are in different areas of growing up (mentally speaking) and they are always having problems with their respected female counterparts (The Jock, the Freak, and the Brain).  But that just the outside.  On the outside the show was the most realistic look at what High School life is like in the post 2000 years, that rivals ""My So Called Life"" in the amount of depth is put onto screen.This is show is a must for anyone that enjoyed ""My so called life"" and ""Freaks and Geeks.""  But I must warn  you if your looking of ""The OC"" I suggest ""Beverly Hills 90210"" (which is a good show in its own right when there where in high school).",5,Life as we know it,1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,2245,"['One', 'outside', 'Life', 'Know', 'look', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210/One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'rip', 'off', 'reality', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'further', 'form', 'truth', 'producers', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'So', 'Called', 'Life', 'LAWKI', 'was', 'realistic', 'look', 'what', 'be', 'teenage', 'boy', 'high', 'school', 'right', 'now', 'Guys', 'watched', 'main', 'male', 'characters', 'were', 'always', 'having', 'crisis', 'right', 'high', 'school', 'america', 'probably', 'why', 'many', 'guys', 'school', 'watched', 'never', 'told', 'anyone', 'Girls', 'enjoyed', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'three', 'guys', 'are', 'three', 'charming', 'intelligent', 'girls', 'help', 'make', 'up', 'cast.Eventhough', 'many', 'critics', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'show', 'still', 'had', 'many', 'problems', 'facing', 'show', 'was', 'based', 'English', 'novel', 'doing', 'can', 'guess', 'title', 'was', 'very', 'frank', 'had', 'more', 'sexual', 'stuff', 'normal', 'teen', 'fair', 'show', 'toned', 'down', 'little', 'still', 'prospective', 'teenagers', 'sicne', 'was', 'bashed', 'FCC', 'post-Janet', 'Jackson', 'days', 'several', 'Parent', 'groups', '.Since', 'had', 'previously', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'extremly', 'excited', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'show', 'When', 'pilot', 'aired', 'surprisingly', 'enough', 'was', 'not', 'dissapointed', 'show', 'took', 'essance', 'book', 'added', 'few', 'american', 'twists', 'ran', 'ratings', 'never', 'went', 'higher', '5', 'million', 'viewers', 'show', 'quickly', 'became', 'favorite', 'show', 'air.The', 'show', 'three', 'teenage', 'boys', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'best', 'friends', 'one', 'Jock', 'one', 'Nerd', 'Other', 'just', 'exsist', 'three', 'boys', 'are', 'different', 'areas', 'growing', 'up', 'mentally', 'speaking', 'are', 'always', 'having', 'problems', 'respected', 'female', 'counterparts', 'Jock', 'Freak', 'Brain', 'just', 'outside', 'show', 'was', 'most', 'realistic', 'look', 'what', 'High', 'School', 'life', 'post', '2000', 'years', 'So', 'Called', 'Life', 'amount', 'depth', 'put', 'screen.This', 'show', 'must', 'anyone', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'called', 'life', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'must', 'warn', 'looking', 'OC', 'suggest', 'Beverly', '90210', 'good', 'show', 'own', 'right', 'when', 'where', 'high', 'school']",Life As We Know It - The Complete Series
