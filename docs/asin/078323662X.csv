Anyway...The packaging, remastering, and inclusions of the theatrical trailers were all great, granted, but this is not all of Hitchcock's best work. Alfred  Hitchcock is my favorite director, and I was shocked to see all the great  movies that were omitted (REAR WINDOW, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, THE 39 STEPS,  NOTORIOUS, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, REBECCA, and THE LADY VANISHES) that are  much better than many of these mostly mediocre movies (TORN CURTAIN, TOPAZ,  THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, and ROPE). However, this  collection does include 4 of my top 6 Hitchcock movies: PSYCHO, VERTIGO,  SHADOW OF A DOUBT, and THE BIRDS. I suggest you avoid this collection, and  get the quartet I just listed and the 7 other classics I previously  mentioned separately.

Others may not be your favorite (mine is 39 steps). However, you will have friends and relatives that will want to compare Alfred's various styles. Look for his cameos. A single case makes the movies easier to keep track of and look better on your video storage wall. Being DVDs this is a one-time investment. With the advent of multiple DVD changers, you will be able to keep Alfred ready at a moments notice.

Even the most dated show Hitchcock's brilliant irreverence, his ""what can go wrong goes wrong"", his Hollywood Stars entangled in a nest of the most talented supporting casts around. The 14th tape contains four episodes from the TV show ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", each of which includes a toungue-in-cheek introduction by Hitchcock himself. One of the episodes is the wry ""Lamb to the Slaughter"", screenplay by Roald Dahl.The quality of the tapes is quite good. I bought my set new and indeed the shrink wrap showed a sticker marked $179.99 although I paid much less.

66963,A7Y6AVS576M03,078323662X,gobirds2,"[9, 20]","This is a mixture of Sir Alfred Hitchcock's directorial productions from both the Silver and Television screens. Hitchcock directed several episodes from his half-hour TV series. ""Lamb to the Slaughter"" is one of the best. Barbara Bel Geddes was excellently cast. In ""PSYCHO"" and ""VERTIGO"" we see characters tormented by their own uncontrollable obsessions. In ""PSYCHO"" Hitchcock attempts to metaphorically unveil some hidden episode in his life that has driven him as a film director. In his masterpiece ""VERTIGO,"" Hitchcock unveils the character within the director to his public in attendance, embodying, in James Stewart's character his own obsessions and desire to physically reconstruct women in an unobtainable image created by his own psyche. This is also peripherally evident in ""MARNIE.""  Kim Novak's character in ""VERTIGO"" is an actress of disposition, a woman whose role-playing supports one man (Gavin Elster and Hitchcock) in captivating another (&quot;Scottie&quot; Ferguson and the viewer). In ""PSYCHO"" we see Norman Bates physically alter his own appearance driven by a distorted obsession to satisfy his mother against his own desires for the touch of women. By becoming his mother he frees himself of his own guilt and his failures as a man and simultaneously satisfies his mother's wishes for him by carrying those wishes to fruition. Scottie, the main character of ""VERTIGO,"" and Novak's in the role of a woman who feels compelled to deny her own identity and allow herself to be degraded in order to satisfy the men who ask her to act their schemes and fantasies, is equally intriguing. This is similar in ""MARNIE"" but with a twist. Marnie satisfies her own hidden passions as she degrades men, in her eyes, by stealing from them. What both Scottie and Hitchcock look for in their perfect woman is the erotic, carnal female disguised within the gray suit and pinned-back hair. Again, this was very evident with Sean Connery as Mark Rutland in ""MARNIE."" Strutt tells an interested Mark Rutland that ""she (Marnie) hides her legs like some national treasure."" Scottie (and Hitchcock) are unattracted to Barbara Bel Geddes' candid and thus uninteresting Midge, who clearly lacks feminine mystique. Madeleine, by contrast, is never as forthcoming remaining distant and enigmatic and is all the more alluring because of it. When she tries to reveal something of her true self, Judy Barton to Scottie, he resists her, becoming all the more determined in his obsessive confusion of illusion and reality. Equally, Mark Rutland wants to hear none of Marnie's pleas to release her when she attempts to tell him that she is not what he thinks. ""I've got hold of something really wild this time and I don't intend to let go."" In ""PSYCHO"" Norman Bates really has something wild, several things in fact. His stuffs birds in response to a repressed sexual state that his mother has subjugated him to. Bates does have something wild and he equally will never be able to consummate his desires just as Scottie ultimately never will. Hitchcock gives himself an escape route in the character of Mark Rutland, but that is left to the imagination of the audience. By revealing the murder plot midway through ""VERTIGO,"" Hitchcock deepens our psychological understanding of the characters and their romantic dynamics.  Freeing us from Scottie's point of view, Hitchcock allows us to study his romantically idealized fixation in an objective light that reveals its hopelessness, at the same time letting us sympathize with Judy, who becomes the victim of his quixotic fixation. As Hitchcock pointed out, Scottie's relentless pursuit of the image becomes a &quot;form of necrophilia.&quot; It also makes him a voyeur who observes and imagines rather than acts in the real world. In ""PSYCHO"" Norman Bates literally acts out his &quot;form of necrophilia.&quot; However, Bates does not have actual sexual consummation. His sexual release is symbolic in the form of slashing, cutting and bloodletting. Afterward he is at peace with his mother until the urges of his passions overcome in. His mother remains ever present. In ""VERTIGO,"" when Scottie really does lose his ideal image, Madeleine, to death, he can no longer function and must re-create her in the new Judy. The person under the disguise means nothing to him, however; all that matters is that she looks and act like the ideal woman. His love is in fact not love at all but a romanticized fetish, a yearning for an unobtainable image that is forever lost. A happy ending to his dilemma is not possible. Unlike Scottie, Mark Rutland is able unravel the enigma that is Marnie and in doing so he is released from his own fetish and is given the possibility to pursue real love with her. Norman Bates remains trapped by the fixation of his mother's hold on him. Norman Bates like Scottie is reaching out and trying to obtain the unobtainable. Scottie can not return the love lost. Bates can never satisfy the whims of his mother, which prevents him from love he was never even permitted to explore.",5,Can You Find the Short Knight?,972172800,"10 22, 2000",2000,5048,"['mixture', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'directorial', 'productions', 'Silver', 'Television', 'screens', 'Hitchcock', 'directed', 'several', 'episodes', 'half-hour', 'TV', 'series', 'Lamb', 'Slaughter', 'one', 'best', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'was', 'excellently', 'cast', 'PSYCHO', 'VERTIGO', 'see', 'characters', 'tormented', 'own', 'uncontrollable', 'obsessions', 'PSYCHO', 'Hitchcock', 'attempts', 'metaphorically', 'unveil', 'hidden', 'episode', 'life', 'driven', 'film', 'director', 'masterpiece', 'VERTIGO', 'Hitchcock', 'character', 'director', 'public', 'attendance', 'embodying', 'James', 'Stewart', 'character', 'own', 'obsessions', 'desire', 'physically', 'reconstruct', 'women', 'unobtainable', 'image', 'created', 'own', 'psyche', 'also', 'peripherally', 'evident', 'MARNIE', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'character', 'VERTIGO', 'actress', 'disposition', 'woman', 'role-playing', 'supports', 'one', 'man', 'Gavin', 'Elster', 'Hitchcock', 'captivating', 'quot', 'Scottie', 'quot', 'Ferguson', 'viewer', 'PSYCHO', 'see', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'physically', 'alter', 'own', 'appearance', 'driven', 'distorted', 'obsession', 'satisfy', 'mother', 'own', 'desires', 'touch', 'women', 'becoming', 'mother', 'own', 'guilt', 'failures', 'man', 'simultaneously', 'mother', 'wishes', 'carrying', 'wishes', 'fruition', 'Scottie', 'main', 'character', 'VERTIGO', 'Novak', 'role', 'woman', 'who', 'compelled', 'deny', 'own', 'identity', 'allow', 'be', 'degraded', 'order', 'satisfy', 'men', 'who', 'ask', 'act', 'schemes', 'fantasies', 'equally', 'intriguing', 'similar', 'MARNIE', 'twist', 'Marnie', 'own', 'hidden', 'passions', 'men', 'eyes', 'stealing', 'What', 'Scottie', 'Hitchcock', 'look', 'perfect', 'woman', 'erotic', 'carnal', 'female', 'disguised', 'gray', 'suit', 'pinned-back', 'hair', 'Again', 'was', 'very', 'evident', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Mark', 'Rutland', 'MARNIE', 'Strutt', 'interested', 'Mark', 'Rutland', 'Marnie', 'legs', 'national', 'treasure', 'Scottie', 'Hitchcock', 'are', 'unattracted', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'candid', 'thus', 'uninteresting', 'Midge', 'who', 'clearly', 'feminine', 'mystique', 'Madeleine', 'contrast', 'never', 'forthcoming', 'remaining', 'distant', 'enigmatic', 'more', 'alluring', 'When', 'reveal', 'something', 'true', 'self', 'Judy', 'Barton', 'Scottie', 'becoming', 'more', 'determined', 'obsessive', 'confusion', 'illusion', 'reality', 'Equally', 'Mark', 'Rutland', 'hear', 'none', 'Marnie', 'pleas', 'release', 'when', 'tell', 'not', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'hold', 'something', 'really', 'wild', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', 'let', 'go', 'PSYCHO', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'really', 'something', 'wild', 'several', 'things', 'fact', 'stuffs', 'birds', 'response', 'repressed', 'sexual', 'state', 'mother', 'subjugated', 'Bates', 'have', 'something', 'wild', 'equally', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'consummate', 'desires', 'just', 'Scottie', 'ultimately', 'never', 'will', 'Hitchcock', 'escape', 'route', 'character', 'Mark', 'Rutland', 'left', 'imagination', 'audience', 'revealing', 'murder', 'plot', 'midway', 'VERTIGO', 'Hitchcock', 'psychological', 'understanding', 'characters', 'romantic', 'dynamics', 'Freeing', 'Scottie', 'point', 'view', 'Hitchcock', 'study', 'romantically', 'idealized', 'fixation', 'objective', 'light', 'hopelessness', 'same', 'time', 'letting', 'sympathize', 'Judy', 'who', 'victim', 'quixotic', 'fixation', 'Hitchcock', 'pointed', 'out', 'Scottie', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'image', 'quot', 'form', 'necrophilia.', 'quot', 'also', 'voyeur', 'who', 'rather', 'acts', 'real', 'world', 'PSYCHO', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'literally', 'out', 'quot', 'form', 'necrophilia.', 'quot', 'However', 'Bates', 'not', 'have', 'actual', 'sexual', 'consummation', 'sexual', 'release', 'symbolic', 'form', 'slashing', 'cutting', 'bloodletting', 'Afterward', 'peace', 'mother', 'urges', 'passions', 'overcome', 'mother', 'ever', 'present', 'VERTIGO', 'when', 'Scottie', 'really', 'lose', 'ideal', 'image', 'Madeleine', 'death', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'function', 'must', 're-create', 'new', 'Judy', 'person', 'disguise', 'nothing', 'however', 'matters', 'act', 'ideal', 'woman', 'love', 'fact', 'not', 'love', 'romanticized', 'fetish', 'yearning', 'unobtainable', 'image', 'forever', 'lost', 'happy', 'ending', 'dilemma', 'not', 'possible', 'Scottie', 'Mark', 'Rutland', 'able', 'enigma', 'Marnie', 'doing', 'so', 'released', 'own', 'fetish', 'given', 'possibility', 'pursue', 'real', 'love', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'trapped', 'fixation', 'mother', 'hold', 'Norman', 'Scottie', 'reaching', 'out', 'trying', 'obtain', 'unobtainable', 'Scottie', 'can', 'not', 'return', 'love', 'lost', 'Bates', 'can', 'never', 'satisfy', 'whims', 'mother', 'love', 'was', 'never', 'even', 'permitted', 'explore']",N/A

Get it before it goes out of print!To echo another user's comment, some of the supplements on the Psycho DVD are hard to get to.
