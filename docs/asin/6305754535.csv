But this time I watched it on a 7ft projection screen and it works even better in that 'medium' than it does on a large flat screen television, even when the video source isn't HD (though of course, in the absence of true HD, the DVD up-scaling and projector do need to be of high quality).I've often felt in the past that real TV works best when seen on a real TV - for example the sort of dramas that are defined as soap opera, like Eastenders or Coronation St, or any other dramas shot in the same sort of way. But it is obvious from this 2000 production that high quality adaptations like this were already being conceived visually as cinema.Still, that is a minor point compared to the quality of this production judged by the usual standards of TV drama or great 19thc novels made into TV serials which we're so used to. Because it seems to me that I've never seen anything better than this, with one possible exception, which is the last BBC adaptation of The Mayor of Casterbidge which I haven't seen since it was broadcast, just as I hadn't seen Bovary again, until now that is.I've owned 'Casterbridge' on DVD for some years without summoning up the necessary will to go through that painful tragedy again but after seeing Bovary I now have the extra incentive of finding out which of them if any can be considered superior. I suspect however that it will be impossible to make a decision.I will concede though that in the case of Bovary it isn't reasonable to claim that it is 'better' than the book whereas when I saw Casterbridge I actually felt able to say that it was - for the reasons I gave in my later Amazon review written I think from memory some time afterwards.Madame Bovary is famous for being one of the most perfect novels ever written, not least because of its style, and I wouldn't disagree. It is obviously impossible for the TV adaptation to be better but at least I feel that it has done it full justice in every way possible for the time allowed. But you could still argue perhaps that like Casterbridge in the final scenes it can have a more powerful effect on the viewer than on reader.I notice that some of the comments by others claim that this is a too sympathetic interpretation of Emma Bovary. I really don't see how they can have got that impression at all. While watching this a friend of mine exclaimed at one point 'it's enough to put you off women!' Well personally I wouldn't go that far but you get the point. Are they confusing this version with one of the others perhaps? It wouldn't be the first time I have come across this sort of thing on Amazon.",5,"Possibly the finest TV adaptation of a great novel I have ever seen,",1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,2677,"[""'ve"", 'just', 'watched', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'broadcast', '2000', 'time', 'watched', '7ft', 'projection', 'screen', 'even', 'better', ""'medium"", 'large', 'flat', 'screen', 'television', 'even', 'when', 'video', 'source', ""n't"", 'HD', 'course', 'absence', 'true', 'HD', 'DVD', 'up-scaling', 'projector', 'do', 'need', 'be', 'high', 'quality', ""'ve"", 'often', 'felt', 'past', 'real', 'TV', 'works', 'best', 'when', 'seen', 'real', 'TV', 'example', 'sort', 'dramas', 'are', 'defined', 'soap', 'opera', 'Eastenders', 'Coronation', 'St', 'other', 'dramas', 'shot', 'same', 'sort', 'way', 'obvious', '2000', 'production', 'high', 'quality', 'adaptations', 'were', 'already', 'being', 'conceived', 'visually', 'cinema.Still', 'minor', 'point', 'compared', 'quality', 'production', 'judged', 'usual', 'standards', 'TV', 'drama', 'great', '19thc', 'novels', 'made', 'TV', 'serials', ""'re"", 'so', 'used', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'better', 'one', 'possible', 'exception', 'last', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'Mayor', 'Casterbidge', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'was', 'broadcast', 'just', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Bovary', 'again', 'now', 'is.I', ""'ve"", 'owned', ""'Casterbridge"", 'DVD', 'years', 'summoning', 'up', 'necessary', 'will', 'go', 'painful', 'tragedy', 'again', 'seeing', 'Bovary', 'now', 'have', 'extra', 'incentive', 'finding', 'out', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'superior', 'suspect', 'however', 'will', 'be', 'impossible', 'make', 'decision.I', 'will', 'concede', 'case', 'Bovary', ""n't"", 'reasonable', 'claim', ""'better"", 'book', 'when', 'saw', 'Casterbridge', 'actually', 'felt', 'able', 'say', 'was', 'reasons', 'gave', 'later', 'Amazon', 'review', 'written', 'think', 'memory', 'time', 'afterwards.Madame', 'Bovary', 'famous', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'perfect', 'novels', 'ever', 'written', 'not', 'least', 'style', 'would', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'obviously', 'impossible', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'be', 'better', 'least', 'feel', 'done', 'full', 'justice', 'way', 'possible', 'time', 'allowed', 'could', 'still', 'argue', 'perhaps', 'Casterbridge', 'final', 'scenes', 'can', 'have', 'more', 'powerful', 'effect', 'viewer', 'reader.I', 'notice', 'comments', 'others', 'claim', 'too', 'sympathetic', 'interpretation', 'Emma', 'Bovary', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'can', 'have', 'got', 'impression', 'watching', 'friend', 'mine', 'exclaimed', 'one', 'point', 'enough', 'put', 'off', 'women', 'Well', 'personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'get', 'point', 'Are', 'confusing', 'version', 'one', 'others', 'perhaps', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'come', 'sort', 'thing', 'Amazon']",Madame Bovary VHS

A country doctor that is laid back, satisfied with the life he has and want's to concentrate only on his profession, and is not into the world of aristocrat friends, parties, balls, dressing up for the evening opera's. This was a very touching film for me, to find out that people make the wrong choice's when it comes to reality of life and that life has been placed in such a bondage that they are suffocating themselves because they see of no way out. She does everything she could to get her husband to live, romance, and explore what the world has to offer.  It was another one of my great choices of films. The characters played there parts to the top. What is really sad that this film exposes to viewing audiences is that people in real life here and now are going through this very act, and who knows there has probably been and are many MaDame Bovary's out there where they no longer could or can not live in a life of bondage any more that they too took their lives in order to have peace.",5,Excellent film I do recommend,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,1258,"['MaDame', 'Bovary', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'beginning', 'was', 'somewhat', 'unsure', 'was', 'going', 'last', 'very', 'end', 'fortunately', 'did', 'girl', 'dreams', 'what', 'marriage', 'life', 'very', 'disappointed', 'entered', 'country', 'doctor', 'laid', 'back', 'satisfied', 'life', 'want', 'concentrate', 'only', 'profession', 'not', 'world', 'aristocrat', 'friends', 'parties', 'balls', 'dressing', 'up', 'evening', 'opera', 'was', 'very', 'touching', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'people', 'make', 'wrong', 'choice', 'when', 'reality', 'life', 'life', 'been', 'placed', 'such', 'bondage', 'are', 'suffocating', 'see', 'way', 'out', 'everything', 'could', 'get', 'husband', 'live', 'romance', 'explore', 'what', 'world', 'offer', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'choices', 'films', 'characters', 'played', 'parts', 'top', 'What', 'really', 'sad', 'film', 'viewing', 'audiences', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'here', 'now', 'are', 'going', 'very', 'act', 'who', 'probably', 'been', 'are', 'many', 'MaDame', 'Bovary', 'there', 'where', 'longer', 'could', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'life', 'bondage', 'more', 'too', 'took', 'lives', 'order', 'have', 'peace']",Madame Bovary VHS

Of course, the censorship of the 50's wouldn't allow nudity or the raw sensuality portrayed here more explicitly.Still, again as in Vincente Minnelli's/Jennifer Jones' version, the first wife doesn't make an appearance; pity, because even though she lasts only a few pages in the book, I always wanted to see her played on film.  Fortunately, Charles Bovary's mother rolls both characters into one - the mother, and the already-deceased first wife before Emma comes along.I read other reviews which said this wasn't up to the usual BBC production values, but I did not find it lacking.

Hugh Bonneville is hopelessly in love with his wife, blind to things he would never want to see.

476565,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,6305754535,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 5]","This BBC presentation from 2000 netted its star Frances O'Connor a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a miniseries or movie, and that certainly shouldn't come as a major surprise.  The character of Emma Bovary is easily one of literature's most fascinating and frustrating heroines.  Although largely unsympathetic (I suppose you might conveniently call her an antihero), it is an epic character arc ripe for dramatic interpretation.  With this literary pedigree, however, it probably isn't a simple task to encompass and channel the intricacies of Gustave Flaubert's classic novel.  And indeed, that is the case here.  Although this two-part adaptation is solidly constructed, well acted and handsomely produced, it still lacks some of the finer nuances of Flaubert's prose.  Again, though, I think that is to be expected.  So instead of comparing the two mediums, I'll just say that BBC's ""Madame Bovary"" certainly stands on its own as a worthy version of the story.As I mentioned, O'Connor does portray the titular Miss Bovary.  The story begins as a youthful Emma finds perceived love in the arms of a country doctor (Hugh Bonneville of Downton Abbey).  Coming from meager circumstances, Bonneville symbolizes success and possible escape from her provincial upbringing.  But as Emma grows weary of being a doctor's wife, she is constantly on the prowl for the next bit of excitement.  Self-obsessed, utterly selfish, and oftentimes cruel, Emma wants what is always just out of reach.  Over the course of her marriage, she finds solace in the arms of an innocent student (Hugh Dancy) and a rakish aristocrat (Greg Wise).  Although these relationships display ample heat and passion, Emma's attachments always feel opportunistic as opposed to completely heartfelt.  What seems like a perfect marriage will possibly be the undoing of the central characters as neither seems capable of making the other happy.  If you're not familiar with the story, it's not hard to see that we're on a road to tragedy throughout.Much of the success of this incarnation of ""Madame Bovary"" rests on the shoulders of its appealing cast.  I must admit that O'Connor isn't particularly the Emma of my imaginings, but I rather liked her play between softness and aggression.  Bonneville doesn't have a great deal to do as the put-upon husband, but when he breaks from his mild mannered nature--you will take notice.  Dancy and Wise are terrific, and very different, foils for our Emma.  In particular, I thought the relationship with Wise (one of the few times she isn't in total control) was dynamic and memorable.  Lastly, great character actress Eileen Atkins steals every scene she's in as Bonneville's disapproving mother.  Whether you love the book or have never read it, this is a worthy and entertaining adaptation.  The two parts are presented together on one DVD (With an interesting Bonus Feature of Flaubert).

476571,A5TZXWU8AALIC,6305754535,The JuRK,"[3, 3]","There's a challenge in portraying the characters of MADAME BOVARY for the filmmakers: how do you make such a reckless, passionate, adulterous ""hot mess"" of a woman like Emma Bovary ""accessible"" to the viewing public?  Does the good but bland doctor deserve to have his life ruined by her?  Do any of her lovers deserve to sail off into a happy romantic ending where she can find that elusive passion?Not if you're going to be true to this story.  And that's part of the reason why Flaubert's story has endured as one of the greatest novels of all time.  People are flawed and complex, desires can be unreasonable and destructive, consequences can be extreme and pitiless.  That Flaubert used his skills as an artist to avoid distracting us with any romantic fantasies is why his work is still read, studied and adapted in film.Frances O'Connor does an incredible job in bringing Emma Bovary to life.  The rest of the cast is wonderful as well but all eyes are on O'Connor.The writing is first rate and the direction is detailed and well-paced.This is definitely my favorite adaption of one of my favorite novels.",5,"""I Waltzed with a Viscount Once.""",1348704000,"09 27, 2012",2012,1112,"['challenge', 'portraying', 'characters', 'MADAME', 'BOVARY', 'filmmakers', 'how', 'do', 'make', 'such', 'reckless', 'passionate', 'adulterous', 'hot', 'mess', 'woman', 'Emma', 'Bovary', 'accessible', 'viewing', 'public', 'good', 'bland', 'doctor', 'deserve', 'have', 'life', 'ruined', 'Do', 'lovers', 'deserve', 'sail', 'off', 'happy', 'romantic', 'ending', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'elusive', 'passion', 'Not', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'true', 'story', 'part', 'reason', 'why', 'Flaubert', 'story', 'endured', 'one', 'greatest', 'novels', 'time', 'People', 'are', 'flawed', 'complex', 'desires', 'can', 'be', 'unreasonable', 'destructive', 'consequences', 'can', 'be', 'extreme', 'pitiless', 'Flaubert', 'used', 'skills', 'artist', 'avoid', 'distracting', 'romantic', 'fantasies', 'why', 'work', 'still', 'read', 'studied', 'adapted', 'film.Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'incredible', 'job', 'bringing', 'Emma', 'Bovary', 'life', 'rest', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'as', 'well', 'eyes', 'are', ""O'Connor.The"", 'writing', 'first', 'rate', 'direction', 'detailed', 'well-paced.This', 'definitely', 'favorite', 'adaption', 'one', 'favorite', 'novels']",Madame Bovary VHS

Emma is just SOOOO flawed in that she's constantly looking for romantic fullfillment outside of her marriage since her husband, although well meaning, is clueless about his wife's desires and needs (not to mention her extra curricular activities!). I only give this review 3 starts instead of 5 because I am utterly dissappointed that there is no US version DVD! HELLO???? What about those of us on the other side of the pond?

476573,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,6305754535,Z Hayes,"[5, 6]","I admit I've never quite managed to get through Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary, and have only watched one other screen adaptation in addition to this 2000 adaptation, which has been only recently released (2012) as a Region 1 DVD. 1976'sMadame Bovary - The Complete Miniseriesmay seem outdated in terms of production qualities, but I highly recommend it for the stellar casting, especially Francesca Annis' compelling portrayal of the wayward Emma Bovary. Then there's this 2000 adaptation starring Frances O'Connor as the ambitious, passionate Emma Bovary. Emma has humble beginnings, starting out as an indulged farmer's daughter who gets a quality education (in comparison to other girls of her station) at an Ursuline convent. She catches the eye of the local village doctor, Charles Bovary (Hugh Bonneville ofMasterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey (Original UK Edition), some may also remember him as the villain inDaniel Deronda) and after a brief courtship, the pair get married.Emma has romantic notions of what life should be like and has the airs and graces of someone above her station. Soon after their marriage, Emma begins to chafe at the provincial and dull life of a village doctor's wife. Though her husband absolutely dotes on her, he can't seem to satisfy her need for romantic passion or fulfill her ever increasing material desires. As Emma nears an emotional breakdown, it is decided that a change of scene might be best for the fragile Madame Bovary's constitution. The couple settle in a larger town where Emma meets a young law clerk Leon (a very young Hugh Dancy) and the pair form a close bond, appearing to be true kindred spirits. Leon shares Emma's passion for the arts, something Charles could never relate to. However this passion for each other remains platonic because of Emma's ambivalent nature, and Leon soon departs for the big city. Eventually Emma bears Charles a daughter. Even motherhood proves too overwhelming for Emma, and she performs her duties in a perfunctory manner, hardly ever taking notice of her beautiful little girl. Only her formidable mother-in-law, Marie Louise (a credible portrayal by Eileen Atkins who can be seen inEpisode 1 - Cranford [HD]) sees Emma for what she truly is - a spoiled, petulant, selfish woman concerned only with her own needs and desires.When a rich nobleman Rodolphe catches sight of Emma, the rake is bent on seducing her, and succeeds beyond his wildest expectations. In Rodolphe, Emma is able to unleash all her pent-up passions and the pair engage in a long-term, torrid affair. How Charles, the cuckolded husband is ignorant of his wife's shenanigans is beyond my understanding when everyone else in town seems to suspect what is going on! The story continues until Emma's inevitable and tragic downfall, though I must say I wasn't the least bit sorry to see it happen.Emma Bovary is one of the most unsympathetic characters I've come across on screen or in literature (at least in Anna Karenina, I felt much empathy for Anna). At certain points during the drama, Emma's inner monologue says, ""This is not my choice."" Yet, she doesn't try to find a way out of her dull, listless marriage or rejuvenate it as a sensible woman would. After all, unlike the female protagonist inThe Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Emma is not in an abusive relationship. Her husband loves her and cherishes her, and yet all she does is hurt him and bring about his ruin. How is one to sympathize with a woman like this, so bereft of love, care, and sensitivity? The callous manner in which she treats her own father, her husband and her daughter makes her a repulsive character to me. Frances O'Connor deserves credit for giving a compelling portrayal of Emma Bovary, with finely nuanced acting that eclipses her fine turn in the much maligned 1999 adaptation ofMansfield Park(which though far removed from Austen's novel, is worth a watch for O'Connor's performance as Fanny Price).In addition to the film, there's also a special feature documentary titled ""A Complex Heart: Gustave Flaubert"" which takes a look at the influences on the author and his works. The film runs 158 minutes approx. with the option of English subtitles. I'd recommend this to all fans of well-made period dramas.",5,Finely nuanced story of an adulterous wife,1347062400,"09 8, 2012",2012,4249,"['admit', ""'ve"", 'never', 'quite', 'managed', 'get', 'Gustave', 'Flaubert', 'Madame', 'Bovary', 'have', 'only', 'watched', 'one', 'other', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'addition', '2000', 'adaptation', 'been', 'only', 'recently', 'released', '2012', 'Region', '1', 'DVD', ""1976'sMadame"", 'Bovary', 'Complete', 'Miniseriesmay', 'seem', 'outdated', 'terms', 'production', 'qualities', 'highly', 'recommend', 'stellar', 'casting', 'especially', 'Francesca', 'Annis', 'compelling', 'portrayal', 'wayward', 'Emma', 'Bovary', 'Then', '2000', 'adaptation', 'starring', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'ambitious', 'passionate', 'Emma', 'Bovary', 'Emma', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'starting', 'out', 'indulged', 'farmer', 'daughter', 'who', 'quality', 'education', 'comparison', 'other', 'girls', 'station', 'Ursuline', 'convent', 'eye', 'local', 'village', 'doctor', 'Charles', 'Bovary', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'ofMasterpiece', 'Classic', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'Original', 'UK', 'Edition', 'may', 'also', 'remember', 'villain', 'inDaniel', 'Deronda', 'brief', 'courtship', 'pair', 'get', 'married.Emma', 'romantic', 'notions', 'what', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'airs', 'graces', 'someone', 'station', 'Soon', 'marriage', 'Emma', 'chafe', 'provincial', 'dull', 'life', 'village', 'doctor', 'wife', 'husband', 'absolutely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'satisfy', 'need', 'romantic', 'passion', 'fulfill', 'ever', 'increasing', 'material', 'desires', 'Emma', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'decided', 'change', 'scene', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'fragile', 'Madame', 'Bovary', 'constitution', 'couple', 'settle', 'larger', 'town', 'where', 'Emma', 'young', 'law', 'clerk', 'Leon', 'very', 'young', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'pair', 'form', 'close', 'bond', 'appearing', 'be', 'true', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'Leon', 'shares', 'Emma', 'passion', 'arts', 'something', 'Charles', 'could', 'never', 'relate', 'However', 'passion', 'other', 'platonic', 'Emma', 'ambivalent', 'nature', 'Leon', 'soon', 'big', 'city', 'Eventually', 'Emma', 'Charles', 'daughter', 'Even', 'motherhood', 'proves', 'too', 'overwhelming', 'Emma', 'duties', 'perfunctory', 'manner', 'hardly', 'ever', 'taking', 'notice', 'beautiful', 'little', 'girl', 'Only', 'formidable', 'mother-in-law', 'Marie', 'Louise', 'credible', 'portrayal', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'inEpisode', '1', 'Cranford', '[', 'HD', ']', 'Emma', 'what', 'truly', 'spoiled', 'petulant', 'selfish', 'woman', 'concerned', 'only', 'own', 'needs', 'desires.When', 'rich', 'nobleman', 'Rodolphe', 'catches', 'sight', 'Emma', 'rake', 'bent', 'seducing', 'wildest', 'expectations', 'Rodolphe', 'Emma', 'able', 'unleash', 'pent-up', 'passions', 'pair', 'engage', 'long-term', 'torrid', 'affair', 'How', 'Charles', 'cuckolded', 'husband', 'ignorant', 'wife', 'shenanigans', 'understanding', 'when', 'everyone', 'else', 'town', 'suspect', 'what', 'going', 'story', 'Emma', 'inevitable', 'tragic', 'downfall', 'must', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'least', 'bit', 'sorry', 'see', 'happen.Emma', 'Bovary', 'one', 'most', 'unsympathetic', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'come', 'screen', 'literature', 'least', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'felt', 'much', 'empathy', 'Anna', 'certain', 'points', 'drama', 'Emma', 'inner', 'monologue', 'not', 'choice', ""n't"", 'try', 'find', 'way', 'dull', 'listless', 'marriage', 'rejuvenate', 'sensible', 'woman', 'would', 'female', 'protagonist', 'inThe', 'Tenant', 'Wildfell', 'Hall', 'Emma', 'not', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'husband', 'yet', 'hurt', 'bring', 'ruin', 'How', 'one', 'sympathize', 'woman', 'so', 'bereft', 'love', 'care', 'sensitivity', 'callous', 'manner', 'own', 'father', 'husband', 'daughter', 'repulsive', 'character', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'credit', 'giving', 'compelling', 'portrayal', 'Emma', 'Bovary', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'acting', 'fine', 'turn', 'much', 'maligned', '1999', 'adaptation', 'ofMansfield', 'Park', 'far', 'removed', 'Austen', 'novel', 'watch', ""O'Connor"", 'performance', 'Fanny', 'Price', 'addition', 'film', 'also', 'special', 'feature', 'documentary', 'titled', 'A', 'Complex', 'Heart', 'Gustave', 'Flaubert', 'look', 'influences', 'author', 'works', 'film', '158', 'minutes', 'approx', 'option', 'English', 'subtitles', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'fans', 'well-made', 'period', 'dramas']",Madame Bovary VHS
