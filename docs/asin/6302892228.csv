The basic idea of the story is good; it just doesn't come across well in the film.  I would be interested in seeing how the relationship of the twins is handled in the book.In the film, there is a confusion about who is supposed to be the ""good one"" and who is the ""bad one.""  The ""pretty one"" is presented in a way to make us hate her--overly curly hair to the point of being ridiculous, and is shown to be vain and selfish.  The one we're supposed to like (played by Fonda) is plain, boyish and sullen.  Yet the supposed point of the film is that the jealousy of the sullen twin is corroding her own happiness and she has to learn to overcome this.  It seems to me that the director imposed her own values on that of the book and in doing so, confused the whole film.Frankly I'm tired of the stereotype of the pretty, blond, girl being mean and superficial while the plain one is really soulful and a much better person.  The truth is that some physically beautiful people are also kind, generous and loving and some homely people are mean and cruel.  There is a whole genre of literature (and films) written by the ""plain sisters"" who have perpetuated this myth.There is some nice scenery and the cast is good enough.  The film ended abruptly, after just an hour.  There was good material in the basic story to make a touching and meaningful film.

This movie (I believe it was made for television) rushes at break-neck speed through plots and relationships, leaving me completely confused as to what the point is, who all these people are,  and what the message is supposed to be. Evidently (if we believe the summary of the back of the DVD case) we are supposed to believe that Louise is somehow 'wrong' to be jealous of her sister, and that she learns to find her own gifts due to the helpful kindness of the sea captain she befriends.  But honestly, Louise would  have to have been a saint to have NOT been jealous of her sister -- a whining, spiteful, unpleasant young woman who receives the lion's share of her parents love and economic support. (SHE gets music lessons while Louise spends her spare time catching crabs to help pay the bills.) And Louise's gifts remain 100% unexplored.  The ending, which is apparently supposed to tie things up, appears to have been tacked on, as the writers realized ""Oops, we have 3 minutes left and we don't have an ending yet."" (Reading reviews of the book, it sppears that Louise becomes a doctor or nurse, but this is not at all clear in the film.)The DVD case is also puzzling. Laura Innes' name appears very prominently on the cover. Her role, in fact, is a VERY small one (far smaller than, say, the pretty sister whose picture graces the cover, or the sea captain or Louise's best friend). Evidently, Innes was at the height of her ""ER"" fame when the DVD came out -- and so she got top billing.On the positive side -- some pretty scenery and cinematography.",2,Confusing,1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,1681,"['will', 'have', 'trust', 'case', 'where', 'book', 'better', 'would', 'hope', 'award', 'winning', 'book', 'better', 'movie', 'believe', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'break-neck', 'speed', 'plots', 'relationships', 'leaving', 'completely', 'confused', 'what', 'point', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'what', 'message', 'supposed', 'be', 'Evidently', 'believe', 'summary', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'Louise', 'somehow', ""'wrong"", 'be', 'jealous', 'sister', 'find', 'own', 'gifts', 'due', 'helpful', 'kindness', 'sea', 'captain', 'honestly', 'Louise', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'been', 'saint', 'have', 'NOT', 'been', 'jealous', 'sister', 'whining', 'spiteful', 'unpleasant', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'lion', 'share', 'parents', 'love', 'economic', 'support', 'SHE', 'music', 'lessons', 'Louise', 'spare', 'time', 'catching', 'crabs', 'help', 'pay', 'bills', 'Louise', 'gifts', 'remain', '100', '%', 'unexplored', 'ending', 'apparently', 'supposed', 'tie', 'things', 'up', 'have', 'been', 'tacked', 'writers', 'realized', 'Oops', 'have', '3', 'minutes', 'left', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'ending', 'yet', 'Reading', 'reviews', 'book', 'Louise', 'doctor', 'nurse', 'not', 'clear', 'film', 'DVD', 'case', 'also', 'puzzling', 'Laura', 'Innes', 'name', 'very', 'prominently', 'cover', 'role', 'fact', 'VERY', 'small', 'one', 'far', 'smaller', 'say', 'pretty', 'sister', 'picture', 'cover', 'sea', 'captain', 'Louise', 'best', 'friend', 'Evidently', 'Innes', 'was', 'height', 'ER', 'fame', 'when', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'so', 'got', 'top', 'positive', 'side', 'pretty', 'scenery', 'cinematography']",N/A
