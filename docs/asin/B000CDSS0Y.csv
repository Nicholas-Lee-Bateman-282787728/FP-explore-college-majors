Why bother making this a sequel if you don't have the same people?  If they wanted to make this movie, it should have just been a stand alone instead of tying it to a previous movie.I didn't care for the change of actors.

Get real!  She found the loop hole after all that!  It wasn't until the last minute that he decided he loved her more than the throne but she had been working all that time to find the loophole.  Instead of just having someone tell the ""wicked"" girl that they weren't getting married, they tried to make something comical by locking her in a room and having her ride a horse, fall in the mud and run in the church.  I'm sure that was supposed to be funny but it was just stupid.  The change in actors, the bad acting and the attempts at humor in this movie actually made it just sad.

957368,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B000CDSS0Y,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","This sequel isn't as good asThe Prince and Me. Rather than keeping the winning acting of Julia Stiles, this movie replaces her with Kim Heskin, who has neither looks nor acting ability to recommend her. Where Julia Stiles played the character of Morgan Paige with grace and dignity, Heskin seems like a whinny teen. Even though Malby stayed in the sequel, he seems a much smaller man. InThe Prince and MeMalby's King Edvard acted like a true king and took command, holding a cabinet meeting. InThe Prince & Me 2 - The Royal Wedding, Malby's king is indistinguishable from any pathetic teen guy.The only thing that savesThe Prince & Me 2 - The Royal Weddingis the plot. It's entertaining enough to smooth over the deteriorating acting. It focuses on a plot by a corrupt uncle to sabotage Paige and Edvard's marriage by raising a legal prohibition against a non-Scandanavian queen. Princess Kirsten, Paige's competition for Edvard's heart, is a breath of fresh air, bringing grace and cunning to the film.

Unfortunately, the sequel falls far, far short of the the first movie.The first problem I noticed was that the entire film is just slightly out of focus. I didn't see a single crystal clear shot in the whole film. In addition the lighting was such that it seems as if no one gave lighting any consideration. All in all, very sub-par photography.The next problem was the script. The actors lines seemed very stilted almost as if the script writer was a beginner. It was almost as if the shooting script was first draft. There were a number of places in the movie where the writer could have inserted really good lines for the actors ... but didn't ... for whatever reason.There was also a problem with continuity; things would change from shot to shot and it seemed as if no one was paying any attention to detail. A lot of things changed from the first movie; Paige is now blonde, Edvard's father is healthy again, no mention is made of his sister Arabella, Paiges parents look as if someone grabbed them right off the street. The list goes on and on.The climax of the movie, the wedding scene, was truly disappointing. This was a ""royal"" wedding? Mt brothers wedding was better than this and it certainly wasn't royal!The DVD itself is also disappointing. Amazon lists the DVD as wide screen. The printed DVD front and back also indicate that it is wide screen. They are both mistaken. What the movie actually is is a wide screen movie letter boxed into full screen. It WILL NOT play in wide screen.In summation, this movie fits right in along with Plan 9 From Outer Space and The Robot Monster.

I didn't expect much from the movie after having read some of the reviews but ""Prince and Me 2"" really isn't as bad as it is made out to be.  You cannot compare it to the first film because the first film did have more going for it - a bigger budget, more experienced director and screenwriters, more talented cast (Julia, James Fox, Miranda Richardson and Ben Miles sadly do not return), better script and higher production values.""Prince and Me 2"", however, isn't totally devoid of charm. Luke Mably is back and still as handsome as ever. His character IS more serious and more grown up - after all, he is king now. Kam Heskin (who I did like in the modern day ""Pride & Prejudice"") replaces Julia as Paige Morgan and does what the script demands of her. The always likeable Jonathan Firth (Colin's brother) is a fair replacement for Ben Miles as Soren eventhough his role is fairly small. Clemency Burton-Hill is quite good as the conniving Princess Kirsten and the majority of locations from the first film are back in the sequel.Instead of the romantic drama that ""Prince & Me"" was, this version is more of a romantic comedy. In fact, I couldn't help comparing it to ""The Princess Diaries 2"" somehow.  After all, this film is about a nobleman relative who introduces a 'complication' to the royal succession and brings forward his younger relative (his daughter) as a more suitable wife to the prince.  ""TPD 2"" is very similar except that the nobleman puts forward his younger relative (his nephew) as a more suitable successor to the throne.This film has its faults, of course. There are a few scenes that are a tad silly or corny (several comedies are guilty of this, unfortunately). The actors in this film simply do not have the experience and talent that the first film had. The screenplay could use some work. I also agree that though Kam Heskin's Paige is not bad, this Paige is just not the same intelligent, ambitious, down-to-earth and no-nonsense Paige that we fell in love with in the first film. I really wish the filmmakers made more of an effort to follow the story thread and characterizations of the first film.All this aside, I still liked this sequel to ""Prince and Me."" It was nice to see Paige and Prince Edvard's relationship reach its conclusion and Luke Mably is always a pleasure to watch.  If you like romantic comedies with the sort of slapstick humor that ""Princess Diaries 2"" or ""Ella Enchanted"" have, for instance, then this movie is worth a watch.
