Miller,"[1, 1]","This review is more for the show itself than the DVD and its features, though I will say that it has all the standard DVD TV Show season features you expect.My personal least favorite season was season 4, almost to the point where I stopped watching Bones because I felt it was so bad.  However, season 5 is a marked improvement, and the show has managed to make each successive season (after 4) a bit better.  Still nowhere near the quality of Season 2, the show seems to be back on the right track starting with this season.  The mysteries are still lacking, and the main characters still have to deal with unbelievably awkward and terribly manufactured situations that are placed in most episodes solely to remind the viewer that Booth & Brennan &#34;like&#34; each other...

1272404,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B002JVWR4A,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[3, 5]","While Season Five of the fabulous Forensic Crime Comedy/Drama, ""Bones"" doesn't offer a unique 'forties'-style film noir finale (the Season Four final episode was in a brilliant class by itself), in many ways, Season Five has been the most enjoyable, entertaining season, yet, and I can offer five GREAT reasons why you need it in your DVD library!1. The Plotlines: Psychics, mysterious couriers, prodigies, neighborhood wars, chicken-men, dwarf wrestlers...victims, suspects, and witnesses seldom get more fascinating than on ""Bones"", and this only covers the first half-dozen episodes of the season! Motives are frequently unexpected, even weapons can be surprising! Superior writing has always set this show apart, and this season is no exception...from an Egyptian Pharaoh, to an alien (the flying saucer kind), to yet another dead Santa, to a JFK autopsy, there's never a dull corpse for the Bones team!2. The Chemistry: It's easy to take it for granted that a beautiful girl and hunky guy starring in a long-running series will be bedmates after a season or two (many shows even advertise the sex more than the storylines), but ""Bones"" creator, Hart Hanson, knows that the electricity between Brennan and Booth works best because their attraction is (as yet) unfulfilled. It gives their friendship a wry humor and wisdom much more mature than most TV couples share. But if you want more sexuality, ""Bones"" Season Five has it, too, with the frequently carniverous relationship between intern Daisy, and shrink, Sweets, and, my favorite couple, artist Angela, and bug-guy, Hodgins (which takes a FABULOUS turn in Season Five, that had me cheering!) And for balance, there is beautiful Cam, dealing with motherhood issues with a strong-willed teen, and sarcastic, wise Caroline, who sees and understands EVERYTHING, and impatiently waits for everybody else to catch up! Add Booth's matchmaking grandpa, an appearance by Brennan's ex-con dad, and the other terrific rotating interns to the mix (Wendall even has a fling with Angela!), and this is a recipe that can't be beat...3. The Humor: Every episode has at least one very funny subplot, as well as the constant stream of one-liners; among my Season Five favorites are Booth beating up the midget wrestler in the ring (while being booed!), Brennan's High School reunion (a near-parody of every high school slasher film), with guest star 'Freddy Kruger', himself, Robert Englund, a very amusing flashback of the very first case of Booth and the 'Squints' (with the welcome return of Eric Millegan as Zack Addy), and another episode with a very funny subplot of the guys waiting in line for tickets to ""Avatar"" (even funnier because Joel Moore, playing intern Colin Fisher, is actually in the film!)...4. Returning Villains: One of the BEST series' villains, the Gravedigger, returns (and in a logical context, at the trial), in one of the scariest episodes of the entire series...I was actually shook, watching it, expecting something horrible as a resolution! Bravo!5. The Season Finale: Beautiful and bittersweet, with so many loose ends tied up that many series' fans were actually afraid that the series itself was ending! Will Cam be left alone, as everyone ponders leaving the Jeffersonian to fulfill their own dreams? I loved it!Season Five is simply awesome! Don't wait five more minutes, buy it! :)",5,"Five Great Reasons To Buy 5-Star ""Bones Season 5""!",1286409600,"10 7, 2010",2010,3361,"['Season', 'Five', 'fabulous', 'Forensic', 'Crime', 'Comedy/Drama', 'Bones', ""n't"", 'offer', 'unique', ""'forties'-style"", 'film', 'noir', 'finale', 'Season', 'Four', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'brilliant', 'class', 'many', 'ways', 'Season', 'Five', 'been', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'season', 'yet', 'can', 'offer', 'five', 'GREAT', 'reasons', 'why', 'need', 'DVD', 'library', '1', 'Plotlines', 'Psychics', 'mysterious', 'couriers', 'prodigies', 'neighborhood', 'wars', 'chicken-men', 'dwarf', 'wrestlers', 'victims', 'suspects', 'witnesses', 'seldom', 'get', 'more', 'fascinating', 'Bones', 'only', 'first', 'half-dozen', 'episodes', 'season', 'Motives', 'are', 'frequently', 'unexpected', 'even', 'weapons', 'can', 'be', 'surprising', 'Superior', 'writing', 'always', 'set', 'show', 'apart', 'season', 'exception', 'Egyptian', 'Pharaoh', 'alien', 'flying', 'saucer', 'kind', 'yet', 'dead', 'Santa', 'JFK', 'autopsy', 'never', 'dull', 'corpse', 'Bones', 'team', '2', 'Chemistry', 'easy', 'take', 'granted', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'hunky', 'guy', 'starring', 'long-running', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'bedmates', 'season', 'two', 'many', 'shows', 'even', 'advertise', 'sex', 'more', 'storylines', 'Bones', 'creator', 'Hart', 'Hanson', 'electricity', 'Brennan', 'Booth', 'best', 'attraction', 'yet', 'unfulfilled', 'friendship', 'wry', 'humor', 'wisdom', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'most', 'TV', 'couples', 'share', 'want', 'more', 'sexuality', 'Bones', 'Season', 'Five', 'too', 'frequently', 'carniverous', 'relationship', 'intern', 'Daisy', 'shrink', 'Sweets', 'favorite', 'couple', 'artist', 'Angela', 'bug-guy', 'Hodgins', 'FABULOUS', 'turn', 'Season', 'Five', 'had', 'cheering', 'balance', 'beautiful', 'Cam', 'dealing', 'motherhood', 'issues', 'strong-willed', 'teen', 'sarcastic', 'wise', 'Caroline', 'who', 'EVERYTHING', 'impatiently', 'waits', 'everybody', 'else', 'catch', 'up', 'Add', 'Booth', 'matchmaking', 'grandpa', 'appearance', 'Brennan', 'ex-con', 'dad', 'other', 'terrific', 'rotating', 'interns', 'mix', 'Wendall', 'even', 'fling', 'Angela', 'recipe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat', '3', 'Humor', 'episode', 'least', 'one', 'very', 'funny', 'subplot', 'as', 'well', 'constant', 'stream', 'one-liners', 'Season', 'Five', 'favorites', 'are', 'Booth', 'beating', 'up', 'midget', 'wrestler', 'ring', 'being', 'booed', 'Brennan', 'High', 'School', 'reunion', 'near-parody', 'high', 'school', 'slasher', 'film', 'guest', 'star', ""'Freddy"", 'Kruger', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'very', 'amusing', 'flashback', 'very', 'first', 'case', 'Booth', ""'Squints"", 'welcome', 'return', 'Eric', 'Millegan', 'Zack', 'Addy', 'episode', 'very', 'funny', 'subplot', 'guys', 'waiting', 'line', 'tickets', 'Avatar', 'even', 'funnier', 'Joel', 'Moore', 'playing', 'intern', 'Colin', 'Fisher', 'actually', 'film', '4', 'Returning', 'Villains', 'One', 'BEST', 'series', 'villains', 'Gravedigger', 'returns', 'logical', 'context', 'trial', 'one', 'scariest', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'actually', 'shook', 'watching', 'expecting', 'something', 'horrible', 'resolution', 'Bravo', '5', 'Season', 'Finale', 'Beautiful', 'bittersweet', 'so', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'tied', 'up', 'many', 'series', 'fans', 'were', 'actually', 'afraid', 'series', 'was', 'ending', 'Will', 'Cam', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'everyone', 'ponders', 'leaving', 'Jeffersonian', 'fulfill', 'own', 'dreams', 'loved', 'Season', 'Five', 'simply', 'awesome', 'Do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'five', 'more', 'minutes', 'buy']",Bones: Season 5

It also includes all 22 episodes of season 5.SPOILER ALERTThe season opens with the wonderful Cindy Lauper guest starring as a psychic, which was a treat. Booth realizes his romantic feelings for Bones, though he is unable to tell her, and he battles the aftereffects of his brain surgery. Arastoo ""comes out"" about his fake accent, as well as describing the relationship he feels exists between Islam and science. Diedrich Bader is Andrew Hacker, Assistant Director to the FBI, who gives a wonderful performance, especially in his frequent attempts to impress Bones, who he has a hopeless crush on. We get to meet Booth's grandfather, who reveals a secret to Bones and encourages her to tell Booth ""when the time is right."" Zooey Deschanel (Emily Deschanel's real-life sister) guest stars as Bones' cousin in one episode. Angela and Wendell begin a relationship, though it ends pretty quickly, and a few episodes after that Angela and Hodgins finally get married (just like we knew they always would.) Cam finally begins dating, and the Grave Digger trial concludes with the Grave Digger being convicted and sent to jail.MORE SPOILER ALERTSThe 100th episode (or episode 16 of season 5), Booth finally professes his feelings to Bones. It's also the first Bones episode that is directed by David Boreanaz. It's mostly flashback, and we get to see the first time Bones and Booth work together, but the flashbacks don't feel like filler (as a lot of flashback episodes are.) Bones declines, and their relationship stays the same, though slightly more awkward in following episodes.

The first four seasons were highly comedic and capitalized on Bones's and Booth's relationship as a crime fighting duo who were also reluctantly attracted to one another.  However, this season, they are a mess over one another.  He is clearly and unequivocally in love.  She is also in love but is scared to death of ever acting on it.  This conflict occurs in every single episode.I frankly think to break this impasse it would be better to marry them off and then have the comedic friction come from their problems as a Nick and Nora Charles type couple (""The Thin Man"").  The unrequited love is sapping the considerable energy and magic of this show plus Bones and Booth as a comedic detective team.  Fortunately, the development of Hodkins and Angela is a lot more satisfying for the viewer.  We also have another wonderful guest appearance by Stephen Fry as Gordon Gordon, psychiatrist turned chef.The ""X Files"" developed the same unrequited problem as it continued and it took 9 seasons to bring Mulder and Scully together.  Yes, I kept watching and will keep watching this show for the very same reason, i.e. the episodes week to week make it worth it.  The forensic cases week after week, the interaction of the full cast, the comedy involving the full cast, all of this makes it worth while watching week after week. But the unrequited love over nine seasons made the final few seasons of the ""X files"" barely watchable and I hope that doesn't happen here.",4,Unrequited Love Episode After Episode Eroding Other Aspects,1280966400,"08 5, 2010",2010,1599,"['Five', 'years', 'episode', 'episode', 'inability', 'Booth', 'Bones', 'come', 'together', 'other', 'crime', 'partners', 'wearing', 'thin', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'were', 'highly', 'comedic', 'capitalized', 'Bones', 'Booth', 'relationship', 'crime', 'fighting', 'duo', 'who', 'were', 'also', 'reluctantly', 'attracted', 'one', 'However', 'season', 'are', 'mess', 'one', 'clearly', 'unequivocally', 'love', 'also', 'love', 'scared', 'death', 'ever', 'acting', 'conflict', 'single', 'episode.I', 'frankly', 'think', 'break', 'impasse', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'marry', 'off', 'then', 'have', 'comedic', 'friction', 'come', 'problems', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'Charles', 'type', 'couple', 'Thin', 'Man', 'unrequited', 'love', 'sapping', 'considerable', 'energy', 'magic', 'show', 'Bones', 'Booth', 'comedic', 'detective', 'team', 'Fortunately', 'development', 'Hodkins', 'Angela', 'lot', 'more', 'satisfying', 'viewer', 'also', 'have', 'wonderful', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'Gordon', 'Gordon', 'psychiatrist', 'turned', 'chef.The', 'X', 'Files', 'developed', 'same', 'unrequited', 'problem', 'continued', 'took', '9', 'seasons', 'bring', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'together', 'Yes', 'kept', 'watching', 'will', 'keep', 'watching', 'show', 'very', 'same', 'reason', 'i.e', 'episodes', 'week', 'week', 'make', 'forensic', 'cases', 'week', 'week', 'interaction', 'full', 'cast', 'comedy', 'involving', 'full', 'cast', 'worth', 'watching', 'week', 'week', 'unrequited', 'love', 'nine', 'seasons', 'made', 'final', 'few', 'seasons', 'X', 'files', 'barely', 'watchable', 'hope', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here']",Bones: Season 5

1272427,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002JVWR4A,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 1]","We eyeball BONES and we're maybe drawn to the quirky cases and perhaps even marvel at the disgusting corpses, the gristliest in this season, by the way, being that corpse which sloughs off its skin and organs onto the floor with juicy wet noises (in ""The Gamer in the Grease""). If you've been watching this series all along, then you've probably even become invested in the side characters. Me, I love Brennan's rotating crew of odd interns. But let us not talk falsely now, our eyes are glued because of the charming FBI Agent Seeley Booth and the icy and very literal Dr. Temperance Brennan. Nothing quite so frustrating as platonic romance in the workplace in a television show. But this fifth season does throw us a few, er, bones by sort of advancing that whole ""Will they, won't they, why the hell won't they?"" thing. Even if the season does end unsatisfyingly.To backtrack some: In the Season Four finale, Seeley Booth's brain tumor surgery had induced him into a coma. In this coma he dreamt that he and Bones inhabited an alternate reality in which they were happily married. As Season Five opens, Booth has been cleared and fully reinstated with the FBI, except that he still has concerns deriving from the tumor: memory lapses, his suddenly subpar marksmanship, and his lapsed sense of intuition. But the biggest fret is that Booth now harbors romantic feelings for Brennan, except that these feelings may only be temporary aftereffects of the tumor. But, as we learn later, this goes even further back.The winning formula has always been predicated on the characters, and you've probably heard ad nauseam about David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel and that space of intimacy they share; it's what floats the boat for BONES. Cast chemistry and character interaction trump the dry, hi-tech forensics and the murder mysteries, however gruesome and cleverly staged. Season Five produces some pretty head-turning episodes.My personal favorites: Brennan gets her anthropological geek on in ""A Night at the Bones Museum"" when an ancient mummy is found dangling from an electrified fence. Stephen Fry returns as psychiatrist-turned-chef Gordon Gordon in ""The Dwarf in the Dirt."" In ""The Goop on the Girl"" Emily Deschanel's real-life sister Zooey guest stars as Bones's second cousin who likes to quote Ben Franklin. In tongue-in-cheeky ""The X in the File"" Bones and Booth get all Scully & Muldery as they look into a murder in Roswell, New Mexico. Superstition and religious beliefs bump heads as the team investigates a burnt skeleton affixed with horns and a vestigial tail in ""The Devil in the Details."" There's also this hot but creepy angel.So, hey, we all know that Dr. Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan is not only a forensic anthropologist but that she also has a side job as a best-selling mystery novelist. ""The Bones on the Blue Line"" has a Japanese journalist writing a piece on Brennan and her latest mystery novel and the squints conjecture as to which characters in Bones' recent novel are patterned after themselves (and then there's the steamy page 187). Oh, and if you've ever wondered how an emotionally detached, socially inept, facts first person like Dr. Brennan is able to write such popular, character-rich mystery novels, this episode addresses the issue.""The Death of the Queen Bee"" ventures into the teen slasher genre, with Booth and Bones posing as a married couple to attend Bones' high school reunion and catch the urban legendary Butcher of Burtonsville High. I don't want to say this episode is awesome... but Robert Englund guest stars and has fun spoofing his horror film persona. Meanwhile, ""The Boy with the Answer"" puts paid to the Gravedigger case as the cunning serial killer goes to trial. And when I say ""puts paid"" I'm really meaning that the Gravedigger will probably be back. She's simply too wicked diabolical not to match wits with Bones again.And if you've ever been curious about how Booth and Bones first met, the flashback episode ""The Parts in the Sum of the Whole"" recounts that puppy (Eric Millegan as ""Zach Addy"" even pops in). I won't say anything more, other than this episode is kind of a game changer.BONES - THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON comes in six DVDs. Bonus stuff includes: audio commentaries for ""The Proof in the Pudding"" (with actors Tamara Taylor, John Francis Daley, & Michaela Conlin) and for ""The Beginning in the End"" (with series creator Hart Hanson and producers Stephen Nathan & Ian Toynton, all chortling and patting themselves on the back, maybe too much); a feature about the show's 100th episode ""The Parts in the Sum of the Whole,"" with David Boreanaz directing (00:07:05 minutes); a gag reel (00:04:26); three deleted scenes - one from ""The Dwarf in the Dirt,"" two from ""The Beginning in the End"" (totalling 00:03:39); ""The Bodies of BONES"" - focus on the special effects/make-up crew that creates the icky, icky corpses (00:10:50); and ""The Nunchuck Way"" has actors Pej Vahdat and T.J.

We know from the very first episode that it is going to be so, that we are going to move to a close.The main change is in tone. The various episodes are centered on the personal dimensions of the various characters. Personal remarks and personal details are more important than the crimes under scrutiny and the lab discussions are some kind of permanent interweaving of small talk about personal matters and the real business at hand that is in many ways kept at a respectable distance. It is not even rare that someone has to call the lab back to order, i.e. to work. And the cases are often slightly superficial and the conclusion hasty.Then all current business has to be dealt with. First Angela and Dr Hodgins will finally manage to get married but that will have to be under duress, and I must say that was a good punishment for them two. That poor Angela even created a panic with her pregnancy test. Pregnant? Yes, you'll have to find out and from whom.Then a touch of nostalgia with the first case on which Booth and Bones worked together, a long time ago. That brings Zack back into the picture for a short cameo. A sorry case and yet quite a case that made Dr Brennan punch a federal judge in the nose twice.Then we have to deal with the little personnel, those laboratory people who are only interns and live on precarious scholarships. By the way it reveals how these younger people have it a little difficult in life, getting from one job to another, being an intern for some pittance, etc. This should be a good lesson to those who believe a scientist is at the top two years after his or her PhD. That is absolutely false for one and for two it takes many years of precarious and low-paid jobs while doing their primary research for their PhDs.Then small little bits of business concerning Dr Saroyan who finds a good date in the gynecologist of her own daughter. Daisy Wick will go on a one year mission in Indonesia on Dr Brennan's reference. Dr Sweets will stay behind and will be slightly abandoned.The main changes are of course for Dr Brennan and Special Agent Booth. But that, you will have to find out all by yourselves. You must be big boys and bog girls after all.On the other hand the Gravedigger is finally brought to trial and convicted. The main witnesses and testifying experts are the very victims of that gravedigger, Booth, Hodgins, Montenegro and Brennan, which is a difficult situation in front of a jury: you have to convince the jury that your evidence comes from your expertise and not from your desire of vengeance.Then a little tidbit here and another little tidbit there and we are at the end of the season and the sad departure of everyone to the four corners of the globe, if the globe has four corners. The team is down. What will happen then? We of course know there is a sixth season going on right now, but that will change the general outlook. They may even bring in some fresh air, and the last case was a typical case of a completely locked up hoarder's den or lair with fans to move the air around. Five years is a long time for a series. It needs some renewing.

I wasn't even bothered when zach left, I really was never that big of a fan of the charactor. I always thought he was boring, and when he came back in three I thought the charactor didn't serve the purpose that he'd served in the first two seasons. but i think the show has actually gotten better without him. bringing cam on was a brilliant choice in two and I love Sweets. although even though I love every season I will say that so far the last three seasons have been dynamite..(I can't pick just one,Lol) but five was just amazing. the 100th episode proved to the best acted, best written episode of the series. and they remembered history. and although I'm a fan of booth and bones as a coupling. I'm not an obsessed fan that gets upset or threatens not to watch if they do something that I don't understand. Like everyone complained about the finale of four. but the finale of four had a really great outcome in five. just like people are complaining on other boards about the finale of five. I loved it. I loved everything about it. mostly, I loved it because it's so romantic. and you know their going to come back together, closer than ever. even if they come back with opposite others. it's going to bring them together. but anyway, I really enjoyed five. maybe in six everybody is going to see her fighting for him for a change. afterall, in season five he'd fought for her all season long. I think that would be an appropriate change of events. Booth, coming back with a new girl, bones, jealous. her fighting for him to see her and take her like he'd wanted all along. that's what real romance novels and movies are made of. whether it lasts a long time or not. and you know, if it was fast or predictable when things would happen, the show wouldn't be so addicting.",5,my favorite show ever,1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,1852,"['been', 'favorite', 'show', 'day', 'one', 'love', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'bothered', 'when', 'zach', 'left', 'really', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'fan', 'charactor', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'boring', 'when', 'came', 'back', 'three', 'thought', 'charactor', 'did', ""n't"", 'serve', 'purpose', ""'d"", 'served', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'i', 'think', 'show', 'actually', 'gotten', 'better', 'bringing', 'cam', 'was', 'brilliant', 'choice', 'two', 'love', 'Sweets', 'even', 'love', 'season', 'will', 'say', 'so', 'far', 'last', 'three', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'dynamite..', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pick', 'just', 'one', 'Lol', 'five', 'was', 'just', 'amazing', '100th', 'episode', 'proved', 'best', 'acted', 'best', 'written', 'episode', 'series', 'remembered', 'history', ""'m"", 'fan', 'booth', 'bones', 'coupling', ""'m"", 'not', 'obsessed', 'fan', 'upset', 'not', 'watch', 'do', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'everyone', 'complained', 'finale', 'four', 'finale', 'four', 'had', 'really', 'great', 'outcome', 'five', 'just', 'people', 'are', 'complaining', 'other', 'boards', 'finale', 'five', 'loved', 'loved', 'everything', 'mostly', 'loved', 'so', 'romantic', 'know', 'going', 'come', 'back', 'together', 'closer', 'ever', 'even', 'come', 'back', 'opposite', 'others', 'going', 'bring', 'together', 'anyway', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'five', 'maybe', 'six', 'everybody', 'going', 'see', 'fighting', 'change', 'afterall', 'season', 'five', ""'d"", 'fought', 'season', 'long', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'change', 'events', 'Booth', 'coming', 'back', 'new', 'girl', 'bones', 'jealous', 'fighting', 'see', 'take', ""'d"", 'wanted', 'along', 'what', 'real', 'romance', 'novels', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'fast', 'predictable', 'when', 'things', 'would', 'happen', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'addicting']",Bones: Season 5

1272451,A2UO0MN92AQ4L3,B002JVWR4A,Old Timer Too,"[3, 3]","My wife and I just realized we hadn't watched this season of Bones as we rewatch some of our favorite series. So even though the series is now into season 7 (on the air) and we have season six waiting to be watched, I've come to realize that the show has grown a bit ""long in the tooth"" and some of the plot contrivances are starting to wear thin enough to take this down into the mediocre. A lot of fans will disagree, but I've commented to my wife after watching more than one episode that the story was contrived. I've even noted a horrid plot ending where we were told the resolution to the case, rather than watching is play out. Brennan has suddenly lost her savvy in a number of areas and again repeats ""I don't know what that means"" far too many times, especially if previous seasons have already revealed her knowledge in a certain area. In addition, the series has dropped into the Star Trek: Next Generation syndrome of having meaningless (yes, nothing but empty words) techno-babble substitute for real forensics. It is as if we've spend almost five years and Brennan has no ability to learn new things. Her strident attitude toward the mundane has worn particularly thin and is now unconvincing, whereas in past seasons, the character demonstrated she could learn new things.

1272454,A1QYOWY8H6MT16,B002JVWR4A,Phoenix Child,"[188, 192]","At the beginning of the fifth season of the wildly popular forensic drama ""Bones,"" many viewers tuned in trepidatiously after the spectacularly strange fourth season finale. Thankfully, all fears were allayed and relieved when the fifth season kicked into high gear in the very first episode and maintained that pace throughout the season; ""Bones""' fifth season is perhaps its greatest yet.The one thing that has always set ""Bones"" apart from the countless other procedurals on the airwaves right now is the focus on the characters solving the crimes rather than the crimes themselves, and the strength of this approach shines through brilliantly in every episode of this season.David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel return to the roles of Booth and Bones and deliver their strongest performances yet as each character is shaken to their core. As Booth struggles to regain his sense of self, he has to confront the knowledge of his feelings for his partner, while Bones herself goes through a whirlwind of emotion as the emotional barriers she has erected around her heart begin to crumble down, leaving her questioning not only herself but her relationship with Booth as well as her work at the Jeffersonian itself. The tension between the two has never been more delicious or more addictive, and both lead actors knock their roles absolutely out of the park.But while the relationship between Booth and Brennan becomes increasingly more complex, the wonderful supporting cast of engaging characters at the Jeffersonian keep the show moving along briskly and lightly. Cam (Tamara Taylor) must run the lab while dealing with the challenge of being a good mother, guiding the team effectively toward each conclusion; Sweets (John Francis Daley) continues to provide invaluable insight into the minds of the team; Angela (Michaela Conlin) remains the emotional heart and soul of the team as she opens her heart to love's possibilities; and Hodgins (TJ Thyne) struggles with his feelings for Angela as he returns to his abrasive, loveable self.The cases themselves have regained a fascinating light as the mysteries the team confronts become more complex, and the special effects department has outdone themselves in the gore and goop department this year as Booth and Bones investigate some of the most gruesome crime scenes in history, all moved along by the brisk black humor the show excels at; the team investigates a possible secret agent locked in a truck for days, a would-be rocker torn to pieces by an industrial washer/dryer, a gamer literally melted in a vat of fast-food grease, and a dozen more cheerfully disgusting cases where the outcomes of the mysteries hold the power to shock and surprise the audience; the writers have once again caught the perfect balance between the whodunnit and the drama to craft a truly unique show.But it's not merely the cases that hold the viewers' attention this season; season five is full of true powerhouse episodes: heartbreaking cases like ""The Plain in the Prodigy""; darkly comical shows like ""The Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood""; truly shocking mysteries like ""The Proof in the Pudding,""; and even a historically fascinating case written by the author of the original Temperance Brennan novels Kathy Reichs herself (""The Witch in the Wardrobe"") -- however, all of these merely lead up to the three knockout moments of the season:In the fifth season, ""Bones"" reaches its 100th episode, ""The Parts in the Sum of the Whole."" Likely the most beloved and most contested episode in the show's history, the 100th episode completely redefined Booth and Brennan's relationship as it showed the viewers the pair's first meeting, something never before revealed, and circles around to one of the most hearbreaking and yet most powerfully hopeful moments of the series. ""Parts"" was also directed by David Boreanaz, one of the series' leads, and the sheer emotion wrung out of Boreanaz and Deschanel by the end speaks volumes to the talent of the show's leads.As the series continues, however, the characters were shocked to their cores as they were forced to come face-to-face with their most terrifying adversary yet: the cunningly frightening sociopath dubbed The Gravedigger, in ""The Boy with the Answer,"" a nail-bitingly tense hour of television that had viewers' hearts pounding as Heather Taffet, the Gravedigger, proved that her true arena was the courtroom, tearing apart her victims and throwing the entire future of Brennan's life into question.This only segues into the season's amazingly dramatic finale, ""The Beginning in the End."" As the team investigates the home of a hoarder, Bones questions what she truly wants to do with her life, Booth's past comes calling, and Angela's father blows back into town, all leading to a truly shocking season ender, a masterful finale that not only redefined the very foundations of the show and the characters but also contined to set the show on a rising point, ensuring that every faithful viewer of ""Bones"" will be frantically waiting for the sixth season to premiere in the fall.In the past five years, ""Bones"" has redefined the procedural while producing a truly unique show filled with drama, comedy and the most satisfying romantic tension between two characters in years. Featuring challenging cases, intriguing mysteries, gruesome discoveries, fascinating character interactions, and truly touching and shocking turns in the lives of a cast of characters an increasingly growing fanbase have come to know and genuinely care about, ""Bones"" has proven that it still has plenty of tricks to show, and this wonderfully strong drama will remain on television for seasons to come.Five out of five stars.NOTE: The fifth season also features the return of Max (Ryan O'Neil), Brennan's father, as well as a memorable cameo by Zooey Deschanel (Emily's real-life sister) as Brennan's zany cousin, as well as a truly touching show introducing Booth's grandfather, as well as the return of Jared Booth (Brendan Fehr), Seeley's younger brother, who has some news of his own.Also, it is important to note that in the fifth season, the writers managed to fix a truly annoying plot device: the revolving interns, who alternated between odd and downright annoying throughout the fourth season, have now managed to find a balance and a home on the show, with each character's unique traits adding to the episode they are featured in, providing some much-needed comic relief as well as some unexpected drama along the way.",5,"An Explosive, Emotive, and Heart-Pounding Thrill Ride",1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,6504,"['beginning', 'fifth', 'season', 'wildly', 'popular',

Without the character of Zac Addy, I find there is a big gap in the camadrie and humor that made this show. The revolving squiterns are interesting, but can be quite annoying.The episodes, as usual are interesting and at times, humorous. I particularly find the episods with Angela's father appearing to be very funny.
