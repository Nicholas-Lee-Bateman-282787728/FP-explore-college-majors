1438039,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0052T1EBS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","I understand that comedy is subjective. Along with music, it is one of the harder categories of entertainment to judge because, oftentimes, it just comes down to a matter of taste. But comedy DVDs have an additional stigma that other DVD choices don't face. They have less replay value. If you are a fan of a particular comedian and you follow them, you have to expect that you will hear some material that they've used successfully in the past. The most common complaint I see leveled at comedy DVDs are that the jokes aren't fresh. That's right, folks--every time a comedian steps up to the stage, his entire act isn't going to be newly devised and original. And if you were going to tape a show for the general public to buy, wouldn't you use jokes and material that have proven popular and successful? I would!That said, I'm a fan of Lavell Crawford. I knew what to expect going in--and while I think the man is generally hilarious, this concert was wildly uneven for my taste. I am undoubtedly in the minority--his St. Louis audience embraced the act wholeheartedly. Crawford is undeniably successful when spinning a yarn about his family or upbringing. When he talks about his mother and a simple trip to the grocery store, the routine soared with its simplicity and Crawford's spot-on impersonation. Other targets were a bit too expected. The mere mention of homosexuality is the ultimate punchline that recurs through the concert piece which seems somewhat unimaginative in this day and age. I don't ask for political correctness, I just look for something more creative from Crawford's humor. I had seem some of the routine in other incarnations--but it all fits together nicely here. A solid showcase for Crawford if not the best I've seen of him. About 3 1/2 stars.
