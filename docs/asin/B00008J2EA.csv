The pacing of the film is very slow, you could walk out of the room for 20 minutes and not miss much. I would put it on the same level as a D grade Lifetime Network made for TV job.

742999,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00008J2EA,Z Hayes,"[5, 5]","I watched this touching movie today and was absolutely riveted from start to finish. Glenn Close and James Woods play a successful couple who after 11 years of marriage still find themselves unable to have a child. They tire of medical attempts and finally decide to adopt a child. Mary Stuart Masterson and Kevin Dillon play teen parents-to-be who realise they can't raise a kid and decide to give their soon to be born baby up for adoption.This is an emotionally heart-wrenching movie about the joys and pitfalls of adopting, on both the biological and adoptive parents. All the lead actors have done an amazing job in portraying the emotional fragility that each character goes through in the process. Glenn Close is so subtle yet riveting in her performance as a woman desperately yearning to have a baby and experience motherhood. It is a performance I shall not forget anytime soon. Her husband as played by James Woods is tender and credible in his role. Mary Stuart Masterson conveys all the fears and hopes of an unwed teen mother with a high degree of realism.All in all, this is a wonderfully poignant family drama that will touch your heart.",5,A poignant family drama,1214179200,"06 23, 2008",2008,1153,"['watched', 'touching', 'movie', 'today', 'was', 'absolutely', 'riveted', 'start', 'finish', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'James', 'Woods', 'successful', 'couple', 'who', '11', 'years', 'marriage', 'still', 'find', 'unable', 'have', 'child', 'tire', 'medical', 'attempts', 'finally', 'decide', 'adopt', 'child', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'play', 'teen', 'parents-to-be', 'who', 'realise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'raise', 'kid', 'decide', 'give', 'soon', 'be', 'born', 'baby', 'up', 'adoption.This', 'emotionally', 'heart-wrenching', 'movie', 'joys', 'pitfalls', 'adopting', 'biological', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'lead', 'actors', 'have', 'done', 'amazing', 'job', 'portraying', 'emotional', 'fragility', 'character', 'process', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'so', 'subtle', 'yet', 'riveting', 'performance', 'woman', 'desperately', 'yearning', 'have', 'baby', 'experience', 'motherhood', 'performance', 'shall', 'not', 'forget', 'anytime', 'soon', 'husband', 'played', 'James', 'Woods', 'tender', 'credible', 'role', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'fears', 'hopes', 'unwed', 'teen', 'mother', 'high', 'degree', 'realism.All', 'wonderfully', 'poignant', 'family', 'drama', 'will', 'touch', 'heart']",Immediate Family
