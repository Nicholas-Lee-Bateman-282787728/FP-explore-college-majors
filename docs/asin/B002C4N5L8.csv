1261983,AWA88F5TOX8VL,B002C4N5L8,"4-Legged Defender ""Anthony C. Rubbo""","[4, 6]","[MY BLOOD RUNS COLD - (1965) - Widescreen presentation]  Fans of stars Joey Heatherton and Troy Donahue have reason to rejoice in the release of this minor film from the Warner Archive Collection, as it slipped under the radar for most upon initial release. This probably due to the fact that it was shot in B+W; after all, it was the mid 60's and everyone who went to the movies then went to see the glorious color films of the day - unless your folks had bucks, you probably only had a B+W TV at home. I was initially bummed to find it wasn't in color, but this flick benefits greatly from director William Conrad's choice to film it this way, as it's an American gothic pseudo-horror tale that takes place on the West Coast, and shooting it in color would have ruined it, reducing it to a lightweight beach blanket flick.Joey Heatherton proves she has solid acting chops (as well as mad dancing skills) here as Julie, the spoiled rich young heiress who's prematurely bored with her life, taking to crashing family cars and wrecking family boats. She nearly kills a motorcycle driver, her boyfriend and herself along the shore road one day and the cycle driver, Ben (Troy Donahue), swears he knows her. In fact, he proclaims they were lovers in a former life. (And this predated the widespread use of LSD). He's a bit bruised up, so Julie and her beau take him to her home for medical treatment by the family doctor. Barry Sullivan plays her father, an egocentric widowed tycoon, and Jeanette Nolan gives a standout performance as her aunt. (Her dialogue, fashions and hairstyles are terrific). Ben insists he knows Julie, and makes shocking statements about the family's past that no one should have access to. Julie initially finds him creepy, but her aunt is both fascinated and uneasy about his comments.Ben pursues Julie relentlessly, even giving her an antique locket with a picture of her in her former incarnation inside, and soon enough, her boredom with her conservative boyfriend sends her into Ben's arms. Her father protests in the typical Romeo and Juliet fashion, so they eventually plan on running away together. As soon as they do, skeletons from Ben's closet collide with the skeletons in Julie's family history, and toxic tensions mount on the stormy seas off the California Coast for all concerned. A somewhat predictable conclusion ensues but leaves one content, entertained and satisfied when end credits roll. Joey looks darling with longer hair and even manages to do a little wiggle and giggle dance maneuver at one point, reminding us who she was and what we remember her for. Troy looks dreamy (I guess) for his female fans, but I never thought much of his acting ability, and his studio dropped his contract shortly after this film. Is this a great film? Certainly not. But for fans of the stars, gothic elements or 60's cinema, it's quite engaging. Will your blood run cold? Probably not, unless anemia runs in your family, but anemia's preferred to what runs in this family's past.Flawless video and audio quality, chalk up another winner from Warner's Archive Collection.",4,Solid Gothic Escapist Entertainment...,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,3104,"['[', 'MY', 'BLOOD', 'RUNS', 'COLD', '1965', 'Widescreen', 'presentation', ']', 'Fans', 'stars', 'Joey', 'Heatherton', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'have', 'reason', 'rejoice', 'release', 'minor', 'film', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'Collection', 'slipped', 'radar', 'most', 'upon', 'initial', 'release', 'probably', 'due', 'fact', 'was', 'shot', 'B+W', 'was', 'mid', '60', 'everyone', 'who', 'went', 'movies', 'then', 'went', 'see', 'glorious', 'color', 'films', 'day', 'folks', 'had', 'bucks', 'probably', 'only', 'had', 'B+W', 'TV', 'home', 'was', 'initially', 'bummed', 'find', 'was', ""n't"", 'color', 'flick', 'benefits', 'greatly', 'director', 'William', 'Conrad', 'choice', 'film', 'way', 'American', 'gothic', 'pseudo-horror', 'tale', 'place', 'West', 'Coast', 'shooting', 'color', 'would', 'have', 'ruined', 'reducing', 'lightweight', 'beach', 'blanket', 'flick.Joey', 'Heatherton', 'solid', 'acting', 'chops', 'as', 'well', 'mad', 'dancing', 'skills', 'here', 'Julie', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'young', 'heiress', 'who', 'prematurely', 'bored', 'life', 'taking', 'crashing', 'family', 'cars', 'wrecking', 'family', 'boats', 'nearly', 'motorcycle', 'driver', 'boyfriend', 'shore', 'road', 'one', 'day', 'cycle', 'driver', 'Ben', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'fact', 'were', 'lovers', 'former', 'life', 'predated', 'widespread', 'use', 'LSD', 'bit', 'bruised', 'up', 'Julie', 'beau', 'take', 'home', 'medical', 'treatment', 'family', 'doctor', 'Barry', 'Sullivan', 'father', 'egocentric', 'widowed', 'tycoon', 'Jeanette', 'Nolan', 'standout', 'performance', 'aunt', 'Her', 'dialogue', 'fashions', 'hairstyles', 'are', 'terrific', 'Ben', 'Julie', 'shocking', 'statements', 'family', 'past', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'access', 'Julie', 'initially', 'creepy', 'aunt', 'fascinated', 'uneasy', 'comments.Ben', 'pursues', 'Julie', 'relentlessly', 'even', 'giving', 'antique', 'locket', 'picture', 'former', 'incarnation', 'inside', 'soon', 'enough', 'boredom', 'conservative', 'boyfriend', 'Ben', 'arms', 'father', 'protests', 'typical', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'fashion', 'eventually', 'plan', 'running', 'away', 'together', 'As', 'soon', 'do', 'skeletons', 'Ben', 'closet', 'collide', 'skeletons', 'Julie', 'family', 'history', 'toxic', 'tensions', 'mount', 'stormy', 'seas', 'California', 'Coast', 'concerned', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'conclusion', 'ensues', 'one', 'content', 'entertained', 'satisfied', 'when', 'end', 'roll', 'Joey', 'darling', 'longer', 'hair', 'even', 'manages', 'do', 'little', 'wiggle', 'giggle', 'dance', 'maneuver', 'one', 'point', 'reminding', 'who', 'was', 'what', 'remember', 'Troy', 'dreamy', 'guess', 'female', 'fans', 'never', 'thought', 'much', 'acting', 'ability', 'studio', 'dropped', 'contract', 'shortly', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'Certainly', 'not', 'fans', 'stars', 'gothic', 'elements', '60', 'cinema', 'quite', 'engaging', 'Will', 'blood', 'run', 'cold', 'Probably', 'not', 'anemia', 'runs', 'family', 'anemia', 'preferred', 'what', 'family', 'past.Flawless', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'chalk', 'up', 'winner', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'Collection']",My Blood Runs Cold
