Based on Dennis Lehane's book Shutter Island is the story of two U.S. Marshalls, who go to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patients Rachel Solando who has disappeared from a mental asylum on that island.  The duo set out to investigate the mysterious happenings and confront a shocking ending.I thought the movie was excellent in all respects and a great adaptation of a fine book. It is hard to adapt great books but the movie does just that. The direction was first rate which was expected of a director like Martin Scorcese. Leonardo Caprio delivers a fine performance and I think is on his way to become one of the finest actors of his generation. The end of the movie was haunting and the viewer has to watch the movie carefully or twice to understand the twister. If you cannot, I suggest watch the making of instead. I loved the film. 3 stars.",3,Fine adaptation of Lehanes book,1287878400,"10 24, 2010",2010,1022,"['Inception', 'was', 'mind', 'bender', 'movie', 'people', 'loved', 'fail', 'understand', 'same', 'people', 'have', 'ignored', 'similar', 'themed', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'Based', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'book', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'story', 'two', 'U.S.', 'Marshalls', 'who', 'go', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'investigate', 'disappearance', 'patients', 'Rachel', 'Solando', 'who', 'disappeared', 'mental', 'asylum', 'island', 'duo', 'set', 'out', 'investigate', 'mysterious', 'happenings', 'confront', 'shocking', 'ending.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'excellent', 'respects', 'great', 'adaptation', 'fine', 'book', 'hard', 'adapt', 'great', 'books', 'movie', 'just', 'direction', 'was', 'first', 'rate', 'was', 'expected', 'director', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'Leonardo', 'Caprio', 'fine', 'performance', 'think', 'way', 'become', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'generation', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'haunting', 'viewer', 'watch', 'movie', 'carefully', 'twice', 'understand', 'twister', 'can', 'not', 'suggest', 'making', 'instead', 'loved', 'film', '3', 'stars']",N/A

1196230,AOXL514GEE4AA,B001GCUO5W,"Anthony &#34;Is Blu for You&#34; Scultore ""Up...","[1, 2]","Scorcese excels in another wonderful character driven piece. Based on a novel, the story takes place in 1954. DiCaprio plays U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels, and he does so convincingly. Teddy is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Hospital for the criminally insane. As he starts to dig deeper and deeper into the case, he begins to wonder if somehow he is part of a much larger and twisted plot. Teddy quickly realizes that he must solve this case and get off the island before he loses his own ""sanity"".This movie really deserves 4.5 stars. Scorcese is such a master of building a ""real"" world in his fims. You feel like it's 1954 from wardrobe to attitude. The acting in this film is wonderful! DiCaprio's range is incredible, which makes him a great actor. We will be watching Leo for decades to come. I will not spoil the movie in my review (I never do), but like the box says ""it deserves multiple viewings"". That is because once the mystery is revealed, you will want to watch the movie from a different perspective. An excellent film!BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Paramount really does a nice job here. The colors are toned down to reflect not only the time, but the mood of the island and hospital. The pictures still remains crisp and every detail is captured to immerse you into the environment. The audio mix is good. SPECIAL FEATURES: Not much here, but the 2 featurettes included are great! After watching the movie, spend the extra 20 minutes to watch them.

So ex World War 11 soldier, now U.S. Martial is sent to investigate. What he finds or does not find on the island of secretive people will intrigues us as the story mores into much more than a simple investigation.If the Dr. Caligari story had not been done repeatedly so many times over the years, this film may have been surprising and more enjoyable. As with all hybrids, there were some tossed in dashes of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (1962), ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956) and maybe the kitchen sink for good measure and voila. Does Marin Scorsese think no one goes to the movies? He cannot be that naive. At least the actors (well known) were really acting and not walking through the script. Leonardo DiCaprio is believable as Teddy Daniels. The music is also a character and does not overwhelm the dialog.

A psychological thriller with touches of horror and jump scares? Boring. And it would be too in the hands of literally anybody else. Instead, we have Scorsese making moods like it's nobody's business & creating atmosphere while still balancing those pesky things called plots and characters. Leo makes good use of the accent and brings some humanity to an otherwise messed up man.Granted, one could only come to this conclusion after the end of the movie since the movie lives or dies by its 3rd act. Personally, I think they did a great job with it. It's unrealistic as all get out, but Scorsese sells you on it, and rest assured if you go back through the movie, it still mostly holds up with the twist. But here's the thing, without the twist, it would be a fairly generic and boring film, even if everything else was the same. The ending and the reveals/twists bring a quiet intensity to the proceedings which lead to some good emotional and dramatic moments, and somehow makes the rest of the film worth it.Overall, if you like a good Scorsese mood piece, then by all means watch this movie.

Directed by the legendary Martin Scorsese, it stars Leonardo DiCaprio, an actor who routinely turns in great performances, with no exception here.Afterwards, I read some of the online discussion. What I found was a disappointment. Not that I went looking for very long, but of the reviews I did come across none of them talked about the political dimension of this film. Why not? (spoiler alert!)For those who haven't seen this movie, here's one reviewer's quick take on how it begins: ""Two U.S. marshals, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, are summoned to a remote and barren island off the coast of Massachusetts to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a murderess from the island's fortress-like hospital for the criminally insane.""As the story unfolds, viewers encounter a common narrative device: the difference between perception and reality. Things aren't as they seem, which raises the challenge of distinguishing the two. But here's what I found really strange about most of the interpretations and reviews that I read about this movie. To a one, they all considered Shutter Island a psychological study of the main character. I saw it much more as a political allegory.Why? Well, for one thing, lest the viewer miss the point, at least three characters on Shutter Island make references to things like atomic weapons and the House Un-American Activities Committee. Not to mention that at an earlier time in his life, the main character had been one of the American soldiers who liberated the concentration camp at Dachau. Several other related parts of Shutter Island convinced me that this story isn't so much a ""psychological thriller"" about Teddy Daniels, the main character. Instead, it's more like a parable about the craze-inducing responsibility of being the United States of America, the world's superpower.For example, why is it significant that the main character was a U.S. soldier in WWII, one who liberated a death camp no less? Sounds like American guilt to me. . . . Sure we got involved in the War. But that was only after Pearl Harbor dragged us in kicking and screaming. By then it was way too late for millions of European Jews. And it wasn't like we hadn't heard news about their plight. We just didn't want to believe it.The good news, of course, is that we--the good guys with right on our side--successfully ended the war, . . . by dropping atomic bombs on two cities. But we would make up for any sins of omission or commission, we told ourselves. Or at least we could prevent those sorts of ugly things from happening again. How? By becoming vigilant. So vigilant, in fact, that at one point in the 1950s we were more than ready to see a Communist behind every tree. Of course, almost all of these people protested that they weren't Communists. But what would you expect them to say?At the end of the film, Teddy Daniels, the DiCaprio character with a history he barely knows, has a question: Which would be worse? To live as a monster, or die as a good man? That's the question that won't leave the U.S. alone. Even when America exercises its power with the best of intentions--and our intentions are never so pure as that--it's not uncommon for many thousands of people inside and outside this country to experience our actions as nothing short of monstrous. The movie insinuates that if your American patriotism reacts with thoughts like: ""But what about our commitment to international freedom and liberty?"" and ""What about all of the good that we do?"" then you're Teddy Daniels, the man who knows only one part of his story, only one side of his identity.But what other alternative is there, except for the monster to cease to exist? The ending of the movie insinuates that that is exactly what could happen in the future. The moral order, the law of sowing and reaping could eventually neutralize, lead to the undoing, of the United States.",5,A Political Allegory?,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,3973,"['went', 'see', 'movie', 'wife', 'back', 'early', '2010', 'not', 'long', 'was', 'released', 'Directed', 'legendary', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'actor', 'who', 'routinely', 'great', 'performances', 'exception', 'here.Afterwards', 'read', 'online', 'discussion', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Not', 'went', 'looking', 'very', 'long', 'reviews', 'did', 'come', 'none', 'talked', 'political', 'dimension', 'film', 'Why', 'not', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'here', 'one', 'reviewer', 'quick', 'take', 'how', 'Two', 'U.S.', 'marshals', 'Teddy', 'Daniels', 'Chuck', 'Aule', 'are', 'summoned', 'remote', 'barren', 'island', 'coast', 'Massachusetts', 'investigate', 'mysterious', 'disappearance', 'murderess', 'island', 'fortress-like', 'hospital', 'criminally', 'insane', 'story', 'unfolds', 'viewers', 'encounter', 'common', 'narrative', 'device', 'difference', 'perception', 'reality', 'Things', 'are', ""n't"", 'seem', 'challenge', 'distinguishing', 'two', 'here', 'what', 'found', 'really', 'strange', 'most', 'interpretations', 'read', 'movie', 'one', 'considered', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'psychological', 'study', 'main', 'character', 'saw', 'much', 'more', 'political', 'allegory.Why', 'Well', 'one', 'thing', 'lest', 'viewer', 'miss', 'point', 'least', 'three', 'characters', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'make', 'references', 'things', 'atomic', 'weapons', 'House', 'Un-American', 'Activities', 'Committee', 'Not', 'mention', 'earlier', 'time', 'life', 'main', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'American', 'soldiers', 'who', 'liberated', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Dachau', 'Several', 'other', 'related', 'parts', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'convinced', 'story', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Teddy', 'Daniels', 'main', 'character', 'Instead', 'more', 'parable', 'craze-inducing', 'responsibility', 'being', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'world', 'superpower.For', 'example', 'why', 'significant', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'U.S.', 'soldier', 'WWII', 'one', 'who', 'liberated', 'death', 'camp', 'less', 'Sounds', 'American', 'guilt', 'Sure', 'got', 'involved', 'War', 'was', 'only', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'dragged', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'then', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'late', 'millions', 'European', 'Jews', 'was', ""n't"", 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'news', 'plight', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'believe', 'it.The', 'good', 'news', 'course', 'good', 'guys', 'right', 'side', 'successfully', 'ended', 'war', 'dropping', 'atomic', 'bombs', 'two', 'cities', 'would', 'make', 'up', 'sins', 'omission', 'commission', 'told', 'least', 'could', 'prevent', 'sorts', 'ugly', 'things', 'happening', 'again', 'How', 'becoming', 'vigilant', 'So', 'vigilant', 'fact', 'one', 'point', '1950s', 'were', 'more', 'ready', 'see', 'Communist', 'tree', 'course', 'almost', 'people', 'protested', 'were', ""n't"", 'Communists', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'say', 'end', 'film', 'Teddy', 'Daniels', 'DiCaprio', 'character', 'history', 'barely', 'question', 'would', 'be', 'worse', 'live', 'monster', 'die', 'good', 'man', 'question', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'U.S.', 'alone', 'Even', 'when', 'America', 'power', 'best', 'intentions', 'intentions', 'are', 'never', 'so', 'pure', 'not', 'uncommon', 'many', 'thousands', 'people', 'country', 'experience', 'actions', 'nothing', 'short', 'monstrous', 'movie', 'American', 'patriotism', 'reacts', 'thoughts', 'what', 'commitment', 'international', 'freedom', 'liberty', 'What', 'good', 'do', 'then', ""'re"", 'Teddy', 'Daniels', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'part', 'story', 'only', 'one', 'side', 'identity.But', 'what', 'other', 'alternative', 'there', 'monster', 'cease', 'exist', 'ending', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'future', 'moral', 'order', 'law', 'sowing', 'reaping', 'could', 'eventually', 'neutralize', 'lead', 'undoing', 'United', 'States']",N/A

The combination of all these different elements makes these films memorable and sets them apart from the films you see and forget about almost immediately.  SHUTTER ISLAND, like THE SHINING, APOCALYPSE NOW, THE GHOST WRITER, THE GODFATHER, AMADEUS, THE EXORCIST, EYES WIDE SHUT, 2001, VERTIGO, to name only a few, keep haunting you afterward, and I think this is because they have, above all, atmosphere.  A strong premise, great acting, unique sets, compelling image and sound, but in particular an original approach by cleverly combining all the tools of the craft to create that strong atmosphere makes these films so much more.  Take, for instance, the use of music in SHUTTER ISLAND.  It's brilliant.  Every time I listen to the soundtrack now (just take the menacing Penderecki piece - Passacaglia) I want to see the film again.  This isn't always the case, and when it happens I know it's a film that may only get better with more viewings, even though you know how it ends.  Take, also, the sets:  the use of the madhouse, the island, the lighthouse.  Again, Scorsese has created something special by paying attention to every detail (weather - the storm!), and made the sort of film you escape into for a couple of hours and which afterwards feels like a memory of something you truly experienced, whether scary, blissful, exhilarating, disturbing.

1196263,A1OSURJOA9MHM2,B001GCUO5W,Jason from Georgia,"[0, 1]","Within the last few years I'm amazed at Leonardo DiCaprio's transformation. He's come a long way from playing the annoying little street rat pretty-boy in Titanic to playing leading roles that one could call... manly! I feel this transformation started in Gangs of New York (a film that I don't like) and culminated in Blood Diamond. Since that time he's gone on to do films like The Departed and most recently, the critically claimed Inception.Perhaps one could say that Shutter Island is more of a psychological thriller rather than a horror film. While I would argue that many of these things are one in the same; I will say that for those who are looking for horror there are plenty of those elements to be found. Leonardo DiCaprio plays U.S Marshal Edward Daniels. He's been sent to investigate the disappearance of a patient at Ashecliff Hospital, a mental facility for the most dangerous and psychotic of the criminally insane. The hospital itself is on a remote island located just outside of Boston. On the fairy ride over, Daniels meets his partner, Chuck Aule. It seems that the patient the Marshal's are looking for has simply vanished into thin air. What's more, things at Ashecliff seem strongly amiss. For example, the doctors and staff are less than willing to cooperate with the investigation. What's worst is that a hurricane is fast approaching, threatening to make Shutter Island even more chaotic.The description above is indeed bare bones but there are reasons for that. I'll simply say that there are plenty of psychological twists and turns that will keep you on your toes and have you wondering just what in the bloody hell is going on. Few films are able to keep me in the dark these days but Shutter Island truly managed to do just that.The atmosphere is captured perfectly. When we first arrive on the island, a storm is approaching yet Ashecliff Hospital (at least on the outside) is presented as a peaceful, well-kept facility with its perfect green lawn and tended flowers. Still, we as an audience know that something is awry from the sinister sounds of the musical scores haunting tone. Of course, much of Shutter Island's brilliance can be credited to Martin Scorsese, a man who has directed such classic gems as Goodfellas.While Shutter Island isn't a perfect film (there are a few scenes I felt dragged on a bit too long) it is in essence one of the most pure horror films you can watch. It plays on many of our fears including mental sanity, darkness and remoteness with the inability to escape. With it's cryptic story, great acting and unforgettable atmosphere, Shutter Island will indeed make you shutter at least once... if not more!

The story unfolds with two marshals searching for a patient missing from a secluded mental institution on Shutter Island that houses society's most dangerous, demented individuals. The edgy score tells us that something sinister is going on, that someone at the institution is hiding something, and that the marshals' lives may be in danger. It becomes clear that marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) has some hidden personal problems, some related to his g.i. days as flashbacks show him participating in the liberation of Nazi concentration camp victims and the execution of the camp guards. As Daniels and his partner probe deeper into the institution, and as Daniels suffers increasingly troubling hallucinations, you become anxious for resolution. This is answered in a gripping reality twist as Daniels' problems are painfully revealed by staff psychiatrist Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley).Acting is excellent. DeCaprio gets increasingly better with each role he takes on. I first saw Van Sydow in two 70's thrillers, The Exorcist and Three Days of the Condor, and even though he's near 80, he still adds a chilling, evil flavor to any film even with only a minor role.

Shimkus ""Movie Manji""","[1, 3]","(I am not a verified customer because I bought Shutter Island BD at Walmart) Shutter Island is set up by Martin Scorsese as a spooky detective story, but think Scorsese, and ponder the possibilities. Leonardo DiCaprio playing Teddy Daniels, is one of our most recognizable living actors at the moment. And perhaps you are accustomed to his characters with Boston accents, who are rough around the edges and know how to use a gun and carries a badge. But Teddy Daniels is hiding a lie from you, and not until the end will you discover the painful truth.Shutter Island isn't a film with WETA-like effects, instead, it's a film in the hands of a true cinema master relying on story telling. You travel through a physchotic setting into delirium. I was very confused through the movie and that is the point. I questioned everything and sought clairvoyance with insanity in my vision. Teddy Daniels will rock your sane world and perhaps you will have doubts about your own reality after watching this amazing film.(spoilers) As described by many of the reviewers of movies the true qualities of Shutter Island comes with repeated views. You see the effort in telling a story from the perspective of a damaged human mind. You realize that the true characters are representations and that key settings and events are tragedies of Teddy Daniels. The effort and attention to detail requires that you give special praise to Martin Scorsese, yes, but also the hard working film editor Thelma Schoonmaker. These peole never get enough credit in my opinion. Many directors owe their careers to Stuart Baird, who edited the wreck that was their films. Richard Donner gives unending praise to Stuart Baird for many of his movies.As far as the BD as a product, I can't say Shutter Island BD's quality stands out more than say the Avatar BD. Once you've seen and heard Blue-ray you really know what to expect. The special contents are bare on the single BD.

I just couldn't.  SHUTTER ISLAND is slow, pretentious, stilted, and clich&eacute;. The ending is worthy of M. Night Shamylan on a very bad day (which is saying a lot considering his many failures.) But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the beginning.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a US Marshall who is headed to SHUTTER ISLAND to find out what happened to an escaped mental patient. There he meets Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow who are the scientists in charge of the place. After several CGI flashbacks, we learn that DiCaprio's character was a witness to the infamous ""Dachau Massacre."" You'll realize, after the movie is over, that this has no bearing whatsoever on the movie, despite a good amount of time being spent on it. (The film's account of the incident also seems to be at odds with the contemporary history.) We also learn, through flashback and clumsy exposition, that he is on SHUTTER ISLAND for a very personal reason - to find the man that killed his wife, whom he still sees in visions. So we have maximum security mental hospital on a secluded island with only one way off. Did I mention they are in the middle of a hurricane? And all their electricity goes out? And the crazies escape? And there's a horde of rats? And... And none of that even matters to the movie, but it's all in there. There are secret messages, warnings, crazies who seem sane, the obligatory shock therapy and frontal lobotomies, and an ending that for the life of me I believe was tacked on at the last minute just because. It's as though they took elements from several movies and soldered them together. It just doesn't work.All-in-all, I cannot recommend SHUTTER ISLAND.  There are many better movies for each of the genres that this film tries to represent. Here's a sample:-  Mental Health: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest-  1950's Crime Drama: L.A. Confidential-  Stuck on an Island: And Then There Were None-  I See Dead People: Sixth Sense-  Escaping from a Prison on an Island: Escape From AlcatrazFor a much more entertaining evening, watch one of these instead.",2,Stutter Island,1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,2196,"['SHUTTER', 'ISLAND', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'film', 'starring', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'one', 'picture', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'SHUTTER', 'ISLAND', 'slow', 'pretentious', 'stilted', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ending', 'worthy', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shamylan', 'very', 'bad', 'day', 'saying', 'lot', 'considering', 'many', 'failures', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'Let', 'start', 'beginning.Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'US', 'Marshall', 'who', 'headed', 'SHUTTER', 'ISLAND', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'escaped', 'mental', 'patient', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'who', 'are', 'scientists', 'charge', 'place', 'several', 'CGI', 'flashbacks', 'learn', 'DiCaprio', 'character', 'was', 'witness', 'infamous', 'Dachau', 'Massacre', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'movie', 'bearing', 'whatsoever', 'movie', 'good', 'amount', 'time', 'being', 'spent', 'film', 'account', 'incident', 'also', 'be', 'odds', 'contemporary', 'history', 'also', 'learn', 'flashback', 'clumsy', 'exposition', 'SHUTTER', 'ISLAND', 'very', 'personal', 'reason', 'find', 'man', 'killed', 'wife', 'whom', 'still', 'visions', 'have', 'maximum', 'security', 'mental', 'hospital', 'secluded', 'island', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'Did', 'mention', 'are', 'middle', 'hurricane', 'electricity', 'out', 'crazies', 'escape', 'horde', 'rats', 'none', 'even', 'matters', 'movie', 'there', 'are', 'secret', 'messages', 'warnings', 'crazies', 'who', 'seem', 'sane', 'obligatory', 'shock', 'therapy', 'frontal', 'lobotomies', 'ending', 'life', 'believe', 'was', 'tacked', 'last', 'minute', 'just', 'took', 'elements', 'several', 'movies', 'soldered', 'together', 'just', ""n't"", 'work.All-in-all', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'SHUTTER', 'ISLAND', 'are', 'many', 'better', 'movies', 'genres', 'film', 'represent', 'Here', 'sample', 'Mental', 'Health', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest-', '1950', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'L.A.', 'Confidential-', 'Stuck', 'Island', 'Then', 'Were', 'None-', 'See', 'Dead', 'People', 'Sixth', 'Sense-', 'Escaping', 'Prison', 'Island', 'Escape', 'AlcatrazFor', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'evening', 'watch', 'one', 'instead']",N/A

Teddy is now a U.S. Marshal that investigates the disappearance of a patient from a strange prison-like mental hospital on the rocky formidable East Coast Shutter Island.  The hospital is for the criminally insane.  Teddy is shown traveling on a boat to Shutter Island with his Deputy (Mark Ruffallo).

Ben Kingsley plays the man in charge and explains the radical treatments they perform here.

Teddy quizzes the head of the institution along with most of the staff on the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a patient admitted after she murdered her three children.The movie is filled with flashbacks, as you wonder why a U.S. Marshall was sent to such a place.

The remote Ward C looms large in his mind, he thinks they are holding the arsonist who murdered his wife.Secrets are unraveled that Teddy fights hard not to believe.""Shutter Island"" is not that engaging and the abundance of eerie visions end up being more of a sideshow.

El-Hewie""","[3, 6]","The narration of ""Shutter Island"" avoided the pitfall of the style of News-telling, such as the movie ""Brothers"".  Both movies shared the same theme of post-traumatic stress syndrome overlapping psychosis. The affected person could not suppress his grossly traumatized mind. His reality is distorted with persisting illusion and delusions. In Brothers, the viewer was told the News simultaneously from both sides of two diverse worlds, with nothing left for the viewer to predict or ponder.  As such, Brothers portrayed unreal, sanitized, and shallow scenarios.In Shutter Island, the viewer lives with the mind of the inflicted person whose delusions led him to distort persons, time, and space, as his mind overwhelmed with unbearable trauma. The health-care taker is perceived by the traumatized patient as a fellow employee form the past work, as Federal Marshal. His incarceration in the mental asylum is perceived as mission to free the oppressed. His reality is a twilight saga occupied by his belated wife and children who were killed in mysterious circumstances. The traumatized patient is haunted by the people he killed or lost, both in his dreams and wakefulness. Once, he perceives those as being burnt in accidental fire, where his role was to pursue the culprit. Another, he sees his wife drowning his children and accidentally had to shot her out of his shock and loss. As his mind fragments, his health-care takers could not make as sense of any scenario he was telling.The greatest strength of the movie was conveying the real experience of dealing with psychotic patients.  The patient is sharp and defensive in some brief moments and quickly relapses into delusional thoughts as his fragmented mind is flooded with painful imagery and emotions. Due to the patient's dismal hopelessness, suspicion and mistrust dominate his relationships with others.Despite the fact that the movie was devoid from sex, violence, or comedy, the public showed great appreciation of the narration of the tragedy of post-traumatic syndrome.  Not only the Saturday's evening show was fully packed, but also did many people reserved the seats for their fellows long time before the movie started.The only disappointing side of the movie was its abrupt ending without any meaningful outcome.  After an hour and half, the viewer has already assimilated the delusional twilight reality of the traumatized patient into the reality of caring for a mentally ill patient.  With the 1950's mental care, one would think that electric shock therapy could have brought such condition into some sort of normalcy.  However, the narrative of the movie was conveyed mostly as the ill patient perceived his own reality.",5,"Without sex, violence, or comedy, a good story touches many souls.",1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,2699,"['narration', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'avoided', 'pitfall', 'style', 'News-telling', 'such', 'movie', 'Brothers', 'movies', 'shared', 'same', 'theme', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'syndrome', 'overlapping', 'psychosis', 'affected', 'person', 'could', 'not', 'suppress', 'grossly', 'traumatized', 'mind', 'reality', 'distorted', 'persisting', 'illusion', 'delusions', 'Brothers', 'viewer', 'was', 'told', 'News', 'simultaneously', 'sides', 'two', 'diverse', 'worlds', 'nothing', 'left', 'viewer', 'predict', 'ponder', 'such', 'Brothers', 'portrayed', 'unreal', 'sanitized', 'shallow', 'scenarios.In', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'viewer', 'mind', 'inflicted', 'person', 'delusions', 'led', 'distort', 'persons', 'time', 'space', 'mind', 'overwhelmed', 'unbearable', 'trauma', 'health-care', 'taker', 'perceived', 'traumatized', 'patient', 'fellow', 'employee', 'form', 'past', 'work', 'Federal', 'Marshal', 'incarceration', 'mental', 'asylum', 'perceived', 'mission', 'free', 'oppressed', 'reality', 'twilight', 'saga', 'occupied', 'belated', 'wife', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'killed', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'traumatized', 'patient', 'haunted', 'people', 'killed', 'lost', 'dreams', 'wakefulness', 'Once', 'being', 'burnt', 'accidental', 'fire', 'where', 'role', 'was', 'pursue', 'culprit', 'wife', 'drowning', 'children', 'accidentally', 'had', 'shot', 'shock', 'loss', 'mind', 'fragments', 'health-care', 'takers', 'could', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'scenario', 'was', 'telling.The', 'greatest', 'strength', 'movie', 'was', 'conveying', 'real', 'experience', 'dealing', 'psychotic', 'patients', 'patient', 'sharp', 'defensive', 'brief', 'moments', 'quickly', 'delusional', 'thoughts', 'fragmented', 'mind', 'flooded', 'painful', 'imagery', 'emotions', 'Due', 'patient', 'dismal', 'hopelessness', 'suspicion', 'mistrust', 'dominate', 'relationships', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'devoid', 'sex', 'violence', 'comedy', 'public', 'showed', 'great', 'appreciation', 'narration', 'tragedy', 'post-traumatic', 'syndrome', 'Not', 'only', 'Saturday', 'evening', 'show', 'was', 'fully', 'packed', 'also', 'did', 'many', 'people', 'reserved', 'seats', 'fellows', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'only', 'disappointing', 'side', 'movie', 'was', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'meaningful', 'outcome', 'hour', 'half', 'viewer', 'already', 'assimilated', 'delusional', 'twilight', 'reality', 'traumatized', 'patient', 'reality', 'caring', 'mentally', 'ill', 'patient', '1950', 'mental', 'care', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'electric', 'shock', 'therapy', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'such', 'condition', 'sort', 'normalcy', 'However', 'narrative', 'movie', 'was', 'conveyed', 'mostly', 'ill', 'patient', 'perceived', 'own', 'reality']",N/A
1196293,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B001GCUO5W,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[0, 0]","This really is a return to form in many ways, for Scorcese the film-maker.  We're in Cape Fear territory here, inasmuch as our Martin clearly wants to show off his directorial skills, and his movie knowledge.  This is not a case of the director being invisible to the process to serve the story - here he is key in using all sorts of tricks and magic to entertain and surprise, visually, aurally and narratively.  Movie referencing is rife (look for the scene running up the stairs in the lighthouse, then go watch Vertigo again), and the nature of the story itself lends itself to some startling imagery.So what's it about?  Well, the less said going in to the movie the better.. suffice to say, that DiCaprio (on blistering form) and his colleague (Mark Ruffalo - understated yet also excellent in the role) arrive in 1954 on the eponymous island as two Marshalls, sent to investigate reports of a missing person.  The island is a sanatorium for the criminally insane, lending a creepy and unsettling atmosphere from the first moment it appears through the mists.  They meet the doctors, Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow in their wonderfully Gothic setting, crackling fireplace and thundery soundtrack from the brewing storm.  However, as time goes by, DiCaprio feels his grip on reality loosening.  Is there a conspiracy on the island?  Is his past trauma in the war catching up with him?  Why do the facts signally fail to add up?  It's a great build - and even, if some have said, the plot is somewhat easy to guess at early on, the machinations to get there never fail to be interesting at the least, and mesmerising if like me you really get into the atmosphere of the movie.Much credit to maintaining the atmosphere goes to the cinematography which is simply magnificent, lending an eerie, sepia toned hue to the period setting, and yet some startling colour imagery in the dream scenes.  The soundtrack too should get an honourable mention, using  modern classical music to create the off kilter feel, rather than one sound from one composer to unite the tone.  You really get the feeling that Marty was enjoying himself to bits making this - if giving him an Oscar encourages him to have this much fun without the weight of expectation, for goodness sake give him another one.Bluray serves this movie very well - the clarity of those sounds, the storm, even the aforementioned crackle of the fireplace, all feel exactly where they should be, and the images are so vivid and startling in high definition it's worth going blu on this one.  If I didn't have a BR player already, this may well be the one that would tempt me to get one.In a nutshell, this is utterly brilliant - at the same time revelling in the love of cinema of old, while adding his own distinctive Scorcese touch, topped with a performance from DiCaprio which roots you in the drama, this is one for those who love pure cinema.  It's eminently watchable, and as the best movies are, eminently rewatchable too.

Furthermore, if you read the book you'd see my point.I read the book nearly a year before the film got released and I loved it. Quite possibly the most edge-of-your-seat book I read in a long time!!!! Furthermore when I saw the trailer and heard Scorsese would be doing the film adaptation I got ecstatic. Scorsese is one of the best filmmakers, and he directed my favorite film of 2006- The Departed. That movie was just spectacular, and it changed the way I saw movies forever. It blew my then-teenage mind, and I'll never forget the first time I saw it.So could tell, I was excited, and flocking to the theatre on opening day, I was ready to place this at the top of my list.The film is true to the book, yes. Is that a good thing? It depends. I was happy they stuck with the book, as basically it seemed like they used the book as the film's screenplay.However, I have the feeling that this would be a one star review if I hadn't read the book. For one, even my girlfriend, who hadn't read the book, knew the ending about 10 minutes in. The plot worked well in the book, but as a movie, just simply fails, again showing that not all books that are great make good movies. The movie is pretty alright, as it is lush and colorful in a few scenes and at times even seems like a gothic horror film.  Again, pretty pictures does not equal good movie.Another thing ruining the film is its ""punch in the face"" musical score. Come on, the score was ridiculous. Spooky tingling piano music!!! Nazi-marching-into-town-music!!! LOUD BRASS music!!! Whoever did the score needs a kick in the teeth. The murder scene near the end was hilarious due to the inappropriate spooky tingling piano music.In short, honestly this film is pointless.

The movie basically takes place at a mental institution where the main character (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner are told to investigate an escaped patient. She was said to have ""vanished through the walls"" so they are basically trying to figure out what could have possibly happened to her. She could not have gone very far, seeing as the mental institution is located on an island that is miles and miles away from any nearby land. As the story continues our main character begins to realize things are a little strange. Things are not as he originally thought they were.That is as far as I will go with that. I do not want to give out any more information, otherwise it'll ruin the movie for those reading my review. I will say this though. Throughout this movie you will continually question everything that is going on. Even by the end of the movie, when you figure out the conclusion to it all, you will still look back and wonder what certain things meant or why it happened the way it did or why certain characters behaved the way they did.All in all, if you are a person who loves to view a film multiple times in order to figure out what everything meant, then this movie is for you.

1196310,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B001GCUO5W,Sky,"[3, 5]","I actually watched Shutter Island twice this past weekend. Wait, that's not 100% accurate. The first time I watched it I kept falling asleep; at one point I think I was out for a good 20 minutes. So I watched it again in the daytime on Sunday, and it turns out the movie wasn't quite as bad as me falling asleep might have made it sound.After a clear-minded viewing (versus my original attempt after an exhaustingly long week and a couple of beers), I can say that Shutter Island had some decent moments. I don't know why but even in the first few moments of my initial viewing, something seemed very familiar about the movie. I already knew what the twist was going to be. I mean, I didn't predict all of the intricacies leading up to the twist, but I knew...I just knew!...where we'd end up when the final minute of the long 2 hours plus of a movie's credits rolled.I'm telling ya, I saw a Twilight Zone, Outer Limits or SOMETHING that had the exact same kind of twist...I just can't put my finger on it. There are great movies with great twists all the time (likeThe Sixth Sense) that catch me totally off guard at the end, but Shutter Island just didn't.Making matters worse was a storyline that you really have to take with a grain of salt and give the benefit of the doubt to. Not that the trauma of Shutter Island's 67th patient wasn't indeed traumatic. It's just I had a hard time swallowing the whole idea that such an elaborate scheme could be pulled off. I guess that in a perfect world (poor choice of words for a place like Shutter Island) it could happen, but boy did the stars have to line up perfectly.What the film lacked in believability and 'keeping it simple' (and short), it made up for in atmosphere. I don't know about everyone else, but Director Martin Scorsese made me feel like I was on Shutter Island and that was a creepy, helpless feeling; the movie gets an extra star for that. Scorsese created a living, breathingArkham Asylumwhere the only things missing were the most notorious villains and the Caped Crusader himself.

1196315,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B001GCUO5W,Tim Janson,"[1, 2]","In 1954, U.S. Marshal Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), go to the Ashecliff Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island. They are assigned there to investigate the disappearance of a female patient who apparently disappeared from a locked room. The chief psychiatrist Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), explains that she was committed after drowning her three children.The Marshals run up against one wall after another in their investigation including the refusal by Cawley to turn over patient files and a generally uncooperative staff that includes Max Von Sydow as Dr. Naehring, another psychiatrist.  Daniels and Naehring quickly form an intense dislike of one another as Naehring is German and Daniels was part of a U.S. Army battalion that liberated the infamous Dachau Death Camp during World War II.  As a storm prevents the Marshals from returning to the mainland, Teddy begins to lose a grip on his own reality, having flashbacks to the horrific images at the death camp and suffering debilitating headaches.  He is determined to get to the island's lighthouse, convinced that it may hold the key to the mystery despite having been told that the guards have already searched it.  The mystery only deepens when the escaped patient is miraculously found.Directed by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is based on Dennis Lehane's 2003 novel of the same name.  Lehane also wrote Mystic River and Gone, Baby Gone, which has some of the same elements as Shutter Island.  What strikes you first is the amazing visuals and the foreboding atmosphere of Ashecliff.  Built atop the rocky island off Boston, part of the facility had formerly been used as a fort during the Civil War.  It hints of the gothic castles and mansion from old Universal Studios horror films.  The island quakes with thunder and lightning, jolting you off the comfy confines of your sofa.Scorsese positions Cawley and Naehring as sinister forces, purposely keeping the Marshals at bay to deep their dark secrets hidden.  Daniels and Aule soon theorize that the facility might have a more ominous purpose.  The pair scurry about like rats in a maze, checking every corner but making little progress in their investigation.Scorsese indulges himself a little too much with the scenery, liberally borrowing bits from noir films and even cannibalizing some of his own films like Cape Fear.  The many flashbacks to Daniels' experiences during the war only serve to reveal Scorsese's hole card much too soon.  About halfway through the film you think there's no way that it can be going down THIS path with a twist that has been done all too frequently in other recent thriller/horror films.  Despite this near fatal flaw, Scorsese manages to pull it all together in the end.DiCaprio gives a solid performance, even if he does look silly in his fedora.  You can feel his growing unease every step of the way. The show stealer is Kingsley whose character combines equal parts creepy and campy.  The fine supporting cast includes Jackie Earle Haley, Patricia Clarkson, and Ted Levine.Despite some of its flaws, Shutter Island is a worthwhile view thanks to its nightmarish imagery and strong performances.",4,SCORSESE PULLS OFF PREDICTABLE TWIST,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,3227,"['1954', 'U.S', 'Marshal', 'Edward', 'Teddy', 'Daniels', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'partner', 'Chuck', 'Aule', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'go', 'Ashecliff', 'Hospital', 'criminally', 'insane', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'are', 'assigned', 'there', 'investigate', 'disappearance', 'female', 'patient', 'who', 'apparently', 'disappeared', 'locked', 'room', 'chief', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'John', 'Cawley', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'was', 'committed', 'drowning', 'three', 'children.The', 'Marshals', 'run', 'up', 'one', 'wall', 'investigation', 'including', 'refusal', 'Cawley', 'turn', 'over', 'patient', 'files', 'generally', 'uncooperative', 'staff', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'Dr.', 'Naehring', 'psychiatrist', 'Daniels', 'Naehring', 'quickly', 'form', 'intense', 'dislike', 'one', 'Naehring', 'German', 'Daniels', 'was', 'part', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'battalion', 'liberated', 'infamous', 'Dachau', 'Death', 'Camp', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'storm', 'Marshals', 'returning', 'mainland', 'Teddy', 'lose', 'grip', 'own', 'reality', 'having', 'flashbacks', 'horrific', 'death', 'camp', 'suffering', 'debilitating', 'headaches', 'determined', 'get', 'island', 'lighthouse', 'convinced', 'may', 'hold', 'key', 'mystery', 'having', 'been', 'told', 'guards', 'have', 'already', 'searched', 'mystery', 'only', 'when', 'escaped', 'patient', 'miraculously', 'found.Directed', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'based', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', '2003', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Lehane', 'also', 'wrote', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'same', 'elements', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'What', 'first', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'foreboding', 'atmosphere', 'Ashecliff', 'Built', 'rocky', 'island', 'Boston', 'part', 'facility', 'had', 'formerly', 'been', 'used', 'fort', 'Civil', 'War', 'gothic', 'castles', 'mansion', 'old', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'horror', 'films', 'island', 'quakes', 'thunder', 'lightning', 'jolting', 'comfy', 'confines', 'sofa.Scorsese', 'positions', 'Cawley', 'Naehring', 'sinister', 'forces', 'purposely', 'keeping', 'Marshals', 'bay', 'deep', 'dark', 'secrets', 'hidden', 'Daniels', 'Aule', 'soon', 'theorize', 'facility', 'might', 'have', 'more', 'ominous', 'purpose', 'pair', 'scurry', 'rats', 'maze', 'checking', 'corner', 'making', 'little', 'progress', 'investigation.Scorsese', 'indulges', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'scenery', 'liberally', 'borrowing', 'bits', 'noir', 'films', 'even', 'cannibalizing', 'own', 'films', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'Daniels', 'experiences', 'war', 'only', 'reveal', 'Scorsese', 'hole', 'card', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'halfway', 'film', 'think', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'going', 'THIS', 'path', 'twist', 'been', 'done', 'too', 'frequently', 'other', 'recent', 'thriller/horror', 'films', 'near', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'Scorsese', 'manages', 'pull', 'together', 'end.DiCaprio', 'solid', 'performance', 'even', 'look', 'silly', 'fedora', 'can', 'feel', 'growing', 'unease', 'step', 'way', 'show', 'stealer', 'Kingsley', 'character', 'combines', 'equal', 'parts', 'creepy', 'campy', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Ted', 'Levine.Despite', 'flaws', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'worthwhile', 'view', 'thanks', 'nightmarish', 'imagery', 'strong', 'performances']",N/A
1196316,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B001GCUO5W,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[0, 0]","Movie - 4.5Out of all the Scorsese films I've seen in the past decade or so (let's say, from Gangs of New York and up), I have to say Shutter Island is certainly the most surprising. Like a lot of people do, I'm sure the mere mention of the director's name is, more often than not, associated with gangster movies or gritty character dramas. But here, he delves into something new - a psychological thriller. Shutter Island follows U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) to the aforementioned facility for the criminally insane, in which he's been asked to help find an escaped patient. During his investigation, he stumbles upon revelations and discoveries that lead to even more mysteries as he starts to question the true intentions of Dr. Cawley (Sir Ben Kingsley), the rest of the staff, and even his own partner (Mark Ruffalo). But with dreams and broken pieces of his past beginning to haunt him, paranoia, distrust, and denial are bound to distract his attention and twist his beliefs. Without spoiling the plot, Shutter Island is an excellent film set in the 1950s with an old-school detective feel to it that manages, not only to intrigue, but also present a good deal of empathy for the characters (something Scorsese excels at). In addition, it also manages to put something into perspective that I've never quite appreciated, and that's the acting ability of one Leonardo DiCaprio. I didn't particularly care for any of his roles in the '90s outside of The Quick and the Dead, but ever since seeing him in this, I've been playing catchup from Gangs of New York till now, and I have to say he's certainly developed into a fine actor with a lot of screen presence and charisma. Equally supportive of his work in the film, though, are some stellar supporting performances by Sir Kingsley, Ruffalo, and what little parts there are for Max von Sydow and Jackie Earle Haley. Shutter Island is a great psychological mystery/thriller that managed to keep me suspended from beginning to end and also has a good deal of replay value as well. You'll know what I mean when you see it.Video - 5.0By far the best quality of this video presentation is the colors. I was amazed at how vibrant the different shades of primaries were from scene to scene and in-between reality and Teddy's memories/dreams. From the cold and murky flashbacks of his days during the war and the snow-covered fields that covered the dozens of corpses in his path to the bright yellows and oranges of his wife's dress and their apartment, Robert Richardson's eye-popping photography makes for an equally tripped-out vision of the many layers residing in the film's visual progression. Black levels and contrast are perfect, giving the movie that dark and gritty Scorsese feel, but also complimenting the atmospherics. The fine lines in clothing, the blades of grass and lush tree leaves in the courtyard, and all the little cracks and crevices within the island's surrounding rocks and cliffs look astonishing. This is by far the prettiest gritty picture I've seen from Scorsese yet and is something I'm very pleased with. One of my favorite shots is the scene where Teddy and Chuck (Ruffalo) are standing on the cliff with the deputy warden looking down at the water. I'm not sure whether or not the clouds and background behind them were green screened, but something about that shot just feels dark, spooky, and ominous and very befitting for the kind of movie this is. The picture is pristine and free of any artifacts or debris and shows no signs of any kind of manipulation whatsoever. Here's hoping to the same kind of quality for Scorsese's future projects.Audio - 5.0Complimenting the reference video is an equally reference audio track. While it's certainly lacking overall LFEs, I have to say I absolutely love what it does for general atmospherics and ambiance, regardless. Robbie Robertson's music supervision and use of pre-recorded compositions from various sources does a splendid job from the very beginning with the foghorn piece to string, brass, and other classical pieces played throughout. Dialogue is especially crisp with its varying amounts of indoor-voice, whisper, and scream volumes and never becomes muddled or lost in the music. Directionality of sound effects disperse themselves from the fronts and rears adding that extra sense of calm and craziness when need be in the form of screaming patients, storm noises outside the facility, metal doors slamming shut, waves washing ashore, birds chirping during the daytime, wind howling at night, the crackling of a fireplace in Dr. Cawley's study, and the dripping of water droplets within the silent tension of Ward C. Separation of said effects, music, and dialogue never bog one another down and really help to showcase the wonders of, yet, another commendable lossless track. While this probably won't hold up to the sound designs of modern day blockbusters, it was perfect enough for me and works very well with the subject matter of the plot.Extras - 3.0Shutter Island only comes with a mere 38 minutes of behind-the-scenes interviews from the cast, crew, author of the novel, and a mental health consultant. In the first vignette they explain bits and pieces of how the film came to fruition from book to movie, what Scorsese wanted to do with it, and a little bit of the actual filming process like set design and music. The second feature focuses more on the medical perspective and history of mental health from back in those days and talks about the transition that was occurring at the time, how the practice evolved between then and now, and the accuracy of how it's depicted within the film itself. While an audio commentary or a more in-depth look at how the movie was made would've been nice, the extras still provide a good deal of information about the story's themes and really helped me, personally, understand the kind of perseverance and dedication it takes to be a mental health professional. But given how fascinated I've recently become with Scorsese and his approach to film-making, I really wish Paramount had gone all out with a whole second disc of extras and one or two commentaries, at least. As much as I hate to double-dip, I actually wouldn't mind doing it for this, pending on what they might add.Overall - 4.5I took the film to be something more along the lines of a conspiracy thriller when I first saw the trailer, which it is in some fashion. But the big twist at the end really threw me in a loop and caught me by surprise. Some people may find this too ""different"" from the norm of Scorsese, but I found it quite refreshing and very entertaining at the same time. Shutter Island is certainly a mystery, but also a finely-crafted thriller that will more than likely have you duped the first time around. Thankfully, it has a lot of replay value and should make more sense a second or third time through. With reference A/V quality, though a much-to-be-desired set of extras, Shutter Island comes highly recommended.",5,Shutter Island (Blu-ray),1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,7015,"['Movie', '4.5Out',

1196317,AE9GUE3HHOX3U,B001GCUO5W,zooni,"[0, 1]","I didn't know what to expect on Shutter Island, the movie's title is sort of off-putting and I thought it was going to be a relitively cheesey pocorn movie.  Then I realize it's directed by Martin Scorsese at the last minute and I enjoy most of his films.  If Shutter Island were directed by anyone else, it potentially could have went into another realm and direction and collapse from within.  I loved Leo Di Caprio in The Aviator and Titanic so he's gained my approval as a decent actor who really commits himself into the roles he's playing.  I was a bit apprehensive when I first heard the east coast accent he devolped for this role and I thought to myself, ""am I going to have to listen to this crap all night?""  But then it seamlessly blends into his character and it just becomes him, which is quite impressive.  There is also something attractive about him that I can't quite put my finger on.  There's this subtle sexual undertone thing going on with him and I don't know if it's because I'm sexually atracted to him or if it's just because he's aging well and looks more handsome now.  This has nothing to do with the movie but it can influence your oppinions about his acting and the film itself.  Actually that's not true because I think Russel Crow is hot but I hate all of his movies, he's a crap actor. Never mind, I'm sorry.  I'm off on a strange tangent.  I enjoyed the intersting story in Shutter Island and it does throw you for a loop at the end when u find out that Leo is actually a patient at the facility.  It's sort of in the same vein as the ending in Nicole Kidman's ""The Others"" (another great movie).  It's very Twilight Zone-ish and creeps you out.  Shutter Island is the first movie I've seen this year that's actually entertained me.  Good movies are hard to find these days, just like men.  I wonder if Leo Di Caprio's single?
