If you enjoy ""Puddle,"" more power to you, bud.I found the jokes infrequent and flat, the pacing is leaden and the plot of this fledgling, early 90s effort is almost non-existent: A semi-likable college doofus tries to steal a brainy co-ed away from her knuckleheaded boyfriend.  The doofus is no great shakes but the boyfriend is such a goober it's impossible to believe she'd be with him so... where can you go from there?Every now and then, a funny idea or a successful gag floats by, but they're few and far between.  Sometimes the scenes go on way too long, sometimes they just end.I've liked the Lizard guys since ""Super Troopers"" and have waited a long time to see this.

937288,A3DHLTFOMOEZ0S,B000B7QCRM,EarlHepJames,"[2, 8]","This movie is a limp-wristed romantic comedy!  As a huge fan of broken lizard, I was looking forward to seeing this early work with fairly low expectations; Not expecting another super troopers but probably a low budget quirkily funny humor.  And yet I was still disappointed.  The amazing thing is there is no indiciation that the guys who made this movie would go onto do the hilarious off-beat comedies that they would subsequently create.One major problem is that this film stars Steve Lemme, and he is clearly the weakest link among the five club dread guys.  He may be the best-looking, but he's the least funny and probably the worst actor of the troupe.  And his character is fairly unlikeable, a sort of bland and uninteresting twit, the typical lead in girlish date movies (which is what this is), made all the worse by Lemme's ""serious"" acting.  In their other movies, the broken lizard guys did well to limit Lemme's weaknesses.  In this movie, they highlight them.Another problem is that the Freaky Reaky character, played by Eric Stolhnanske, is kind of lame and gets actively annoying at times.  This is probably the worst character the Broken Lizard guys have come up with yet.  It's this stock hippie stoner character who's supposed to be over the top, but actually just seriously grates.A third problem is that they spend too much of this movie not telling jokes, but making an annoying, tepid, typical and uninspired romantic comedy.  Chandrasekhar, Heffernan, and Soter are pretty good in their roles, but their screen time, especially that of the latter two, is way too small.There are some funny bits, but there's nothing here that is as ridiculously funny as their other movies.  One of the great things about Broken Lizard is that they've developed a fresh, distinctive, and original brand of comedy.  That is not in evidence here.  These jokes are stale and conventional.  The bonus featurette, rodeo clowns, showing their tour of colleges to promote this movie is often more entertaining, but is not enough to recommend this purchase.  Meanwhile the commentaries are frustrating, because these guys still seem to be suffering under the illusions that this is a good movie and that some of their crappy jokes are funny.  It would be more interesting if they talked about things they learned while making this and how they applied those lessons to making their subsequent movies comedic successes.",1,This Is A Chick Flick - And It's Not Funny,1166486400,"12 19, 2006",2006,2421,"['movie', 'limp-wristed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'huge', 'fan', 'broken', 'lizard', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'early', 'work', 'fairly', 'low', 'expectations', 'Not', 'expecting', 'super', 'troopers', 'probably', 'low', 'budget', 'quirkily', 'funny', 'humor', 'yet', 'was', 'still', 'disappointed', 'amazing', 'thing', 'indiciation', 'guys', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'would', 'go', 'do', 'hilarious', 'off-beat', 'comedies', 'would', 'subsequently', 'create.One', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'Steve', 'Lem', 'clearly', 'weakest', 'link', 'five', 'club', 'dread', 'guys', 'may', 'be', 'best-looking', 'least', 'funny', 'probably', 'worst', 'actor', 'troupe', 'character', 'fairly', 'unlikeable', 'sort', 'bland', 'uninteresting', 'twit', 'typical', 'lead', 'girlish', 'date', 'movies', 'what', 'made', 'worse', 'Lem', 'serious', 'acting', 'other', 'movies', 'broken', 'lizard', 'guys', 'did', 'well', 'limit', 'Lem', 'weaknesses', 'movie', 'highlight', 'them.Another', 'problem', 'Freaky', 'Reaky', 'character', 'played', 'Eric', 'Stolhnanske', 'kind', 'lame', 'actively', 'annoying', 'times', 'probably', 'worst', 'character', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'guys', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'yet', 'stock', 'hippie', 'stoner', 'character', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'top', 'actually', 'just', 'seriously', 'grates.A', 'third', 'problem', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'not', 'telling', 'jokes', 'making', 'annoying', 'tepid', 'typical', 'uninspired', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Chandrasekhar', 'Heffernan', 'Soter', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'roles', 'screen', 'time', 'especially', 'latter', 'two', 'way', 'too', 'are', 'funny', 'bits', 'nothing', 'here', 'as', 'ridiculously', 'funny', 'other', 'movies', 'One', 'great', 'things', 'Broken', 'Lizard', ""'ve"", 'developed', 'fresh', 'distinctive', 'original', 'brand', 'comedy', 'not', 'evidence', 'here', 'jokes', 'are', 'stale', 'conventional', 'bonus', 'featurette', 'rodeo', 'clowns', 'showing', 'tour', 'colleges', 'promote', 'movie', 'often', 'more', 'entertaining', 'not', 'enough', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'Meanwhile', 'commentaries', 'are', 'frustrating', 'guys', 'still', 'seem', 'be', 'suffering', 'illusions', 'good', 'movie', 'crappy', 'jokes', 'are', 'funny', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'talked', 'things', 'learned', 'making', 'how', 'applied', 'lessons', 'making', 'subsequent', 'movies', 'comedic', 'successes']",Puddle Cruiser

937291,A1I8F97AHES8YD,B000B7QCRM,George Graham,"[0, 0]","Every comedy group that gets into movies has to have their first one, and as much as I enjoy Broken Lizard's films, this isn't exactly MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL (AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT wasn't exactly a film, right?). It is, however, a pretty decent entry in the college movie genre, as it attempts to have realistic characters (along with the broad, off-the-wall characters the Lizards most often play) in semi-realistic situations (think of it as the SEINFELD of college movies, not in terms of quality but subject matter). Steve Lemme is designated the lead this time and the part of the straight man as Felix Bean, who falls for Suzanne McKenna (Kayren Butler), who might be student council president (we just don't know). Unfortunately, Suzanne is already dating burly, Crazy Joe Davola lookalike Traci Shannon (Jamison Selby), who a la the Boy Named Sue is a volcano waiting to erupt. Felix gets advice from his wiseass friend Zach (director Jay Chandrasekhar) and hippie mailroom guy Freaky Reaky (Erik Stolhanske), who are also having lady problems, Zach with a hot girl who constantly is running the track and who gave Zach 6 of the digits to her phone number and Freaky with Suzanne and Felix's mutual friend Emily (Alison Clapp). The remaining Lizards, Kevin Heffernan & Paul Soter, play troublemaking duo Grogan and Matt, respectively, who along with Felix tried to raid the cafeteria and got caught (Felix made a successful escape), and now pre-law student Suzanne is their lawyer (leading to a very funny courtroom scene where Matt & Grogan must represent themselves and rely on courtroom scenes in movies and the like). Felix and Suzanne have issues, dating drama, blah blah blah. The romantic subplot is convincing enough, as what Lemme and Butler lack in acting ability they make up for with characters we can relate to. The other four Lizards are playing the kinds of characters they will play in their later films (especially Heffernan, Chandrasekhar, and Soter; after this Stolhanske usually played the straight man... well, if you've seen CLUB DREAD that's not entirely true) and showcase the kind of humor that would be evident in those films.

Well you tell yourself that it's going to have some build up for like a half hour and then you realize that it still isn't as good as you thought it'd be.  So then your bummed out, but you think it'll have a really good finale and you'll laugh your ass off.  Well you just end up WAITING for the movie to end, just so you can see the fantastic send off that you've been waiting for, all the while still being just as bored (but hopefully) as you were from the first scene.  Then the ending comes and it's lame and you get all pissed off and you ummm smash the movie or something.  Well it was sorta like that for me, but I think the end was the only funny part, in fact the last half of the movie is the funniest.  So... still though how could you expect this to be a masterpiece?  Say YOU had a low budget and a few of your friends got together to make a film, would you make a better movie?  I doubt it and they went on to make some funny shtuff so...I do have to say that part where dude is like ""I'll hug any guy who comes out of that bathroom."" and then homegirl's boyfriend is the guy to actually come out and he hugs him and he's like ""what the f*ck!?""  That was pretty funny, I laughed.I'd skip it though if I were you and luckily (unless your hot or rich) I'm not...",3,...

It is also NOT a Super Troopers follow up or even in the same geneIt is a NICE ROMANTIC comedy. A good date flick. If they had marketed that way it would have done well. I went to Colgate 2 years ahead of these guys and loved this film. As it was my college life. So if you were a preppy or a New England college type in the 80's or 90's. This is your movie.
