Contrary to an earlier reviewer, the DVD is easily understandable and I am giving the DVD 5 stars and doing my part to raise the overall rating to 5 stars.The DVD lasts around 1 hour and 40 minutes and contains 3 main episodes:1.  Oracle at Delphi, Olympics, Alexander the Great.2.  Athens, Acropolis and Parthenon, Philosophers (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle), Mars Hill, Paul's Missionary Journeys.3.  Corinth, Corinth Canal, New Testament.As with other Drive Through series, Dave Stotts does an excellent job of describing the site being visited and its importance.  He mixes in good, clean humor, and reverence when appropriate.  I particularly enjoyed his humorous take on the Oracle at Delphi.Good for audiences of all ages.Watch, enjoy, and learn more about Ancient Greece.Recommended.",5,Drive Through History - Greece Is The Word,1306368000,"05 26, 2011",2011,930,"['name', 'Greece', 'Word', 'obviously', 'joke', 'directed', 'movie', 'Grease', 'history', 'ancient', 'Greece', 'Contrary', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'DVD', 'easily', 'understandable', 'am', 'giving', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'doing', 'part', 'raise', 'overall', 'rating', '5', 'stars.The', 'DVD', '1', 'hour', '40', 'minutes', '3', 'main', 'episodes:1', 'Oracle', 'Delphi', 'Olympics', 'Alexander', 'Great.2', 'Athens', 'Acropolis', 'Parthenon', 'Philosophers', 'Socrates', 'Plato', 'Aristotle', 'Mars', 'Hill', 'Paul', 'Missionary', 'Journeys.3', 'Corinth', 'Corinth', 'Canal', 'New', 'Testament.As', 'other', 'Drive', 'Through', 'series', 'Dave', 'Stotts', 'excellent', 'job', 'describing', 'site', 'being', 'visited', 'importance', 'good', 'clean', 'humor', 'reverence', 'when', 'appropriate', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'humorous', 'take', 'Oracle', 'Delphi.Good', 'audiences', 'ages.Watch', 'enjoy', 'learn', 'more', 'Ancient', 'Greece.Recommended']",Drive Thru History with Dave Stotts #2: Greece And The Word
978578,ABC8FXLD7W528,B000ET1JHK,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[1, 1]","Dave Stotts, along with Focus on the Family, Tyndale Publishers, and Coldwater Media, have produced yet another winner in the Drive Thru History Series. Greece is the Word is the second in the series and includes fascinating facts about Athens and Rome, among other places, divided into three segments of approximately a half hour each. Our family enjoyed seeing historical sites and learning, through well-done graphics, the history of several places that Paul traveled during his ministry. Dave does an excellent job of tying together pieces of the past with unearthed artifacts and preserved architecture and how it all combines with the historical accuracy of the Bible. One of our favorite things about the Drive Thru History series is the humor that Dave infuses into each segment, which makes learning fun! I would highly recommend this DVD for family movie night, homeschoolers, youth rallies, and anyone over 7 or 8 years old who loves history. I have added this DVD to my mom-approved movie list on my blog.",5,Another winner in the Drive Thru History Series,1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,1017,"['Dave', 'Stotts', 'Focus', 'Family', 'Tyndale', 'Publishers', 'Coldwater', 'Media', 'have', 'produced', 'yet', 'winner', 'Drive', 'Thru', 'History', 'Series', 'Greece', 'Word', 'second', 'series', 'fascinating', 'facts', 'Athens', 'Rome', 'other', 'places', 'divided', 'three', 'segments', 'approximately', 'half', 'hour', 'family', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'historical', 'sites', 'learning', 'well-done', 'graphics', 'history', 'several', 'places', 'Paul', 'traveled', 'ministry', 'Dave', 'excellent', 'job', 'tying', 'together', 'pieces', 'past', 'unearthed', 'artifacts', 'preserved', 'architecture', 'how', 'combines', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Bible', 'One', 'favorite', 'things', 'Drive', 'Thru', 'History', 'series', 'humor', 'Dave', 'segment', 'learning', 'fun', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'family', 'movie', 'night', 'homeschoolers', 'youth', 'rallies', 'anyone', '7', '8', 'years', 'old', 'who', 'history', 'have', 'added', 'DVD', 'mom-approved', 'movie', 'list', 'blog']",Drive Thru History with Dave Stotts #2: Greece And The Word
