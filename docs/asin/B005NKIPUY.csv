George Clooney slated to play Olen Steinhauer's semi-retired spy Milo Weaver of the thriller novelThe Tourist... and here comes 62-year-old Richard Gere as Paul Shepherdson, a retired CIA spy who's called in from the cold for a special assignment. Shepherdson is paired with a young Harvard-educated FBI agent to unravel the mystery of a senator's murder, with all signs pointing to a Soviet assassin named Cassius, long thought to be dead.Is this an espionage thriller...tinged with remnants of hunts for cold-war Soviet moles and assassins? Well, Yes and No.THE DOUBLE is an attempt by producer and co-writer Michael Brandt to update the spy thriller without trench coats and too many secret meetings. He throws in a great cast led by Gere: Topper Grace as the young FBI agent, Castle's Stana Katic as a Russian prostitute (don't blink - you will miss her performance) and Stephen Moyer of vampire fame as a scarred thug (and Cassius follower) who swallows batteries to get out of prison. He also throws in some propaganda about fake border police killing Mexicans.Filmed in Michigan, the setting often provides panoramic views of Washington, D.C. alaNo Way Out. Now that's a thought, Michael Brandt. Cut out the torrid love scenes of NO WAY OUT and hunt a mole named Yuri in a spy vs spy vs Soviet assassin. You managed the suspense and a nice twist at the end pretty well.Rent, don't buy.2.5 out of 5 stars",3,A Soviet assassin comes in from the cold with a CIA spy...,1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,1582,"['rash', 'spies', 'coming', 'cold', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'recently', 'nominated', '2012', 'Oscar', 'playing', 'John', 'LeCarre', 'older', 'spy', 'George', 'Smiley', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'George', 'Clooney', 'slated', 'play', 'Olen', 'Steinhauer', 'semi-retired', 'spy', 'Milo', 'Weaver', 'thriller', 'novelThe', 'Tourist', 'here', '62-year-old', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Paul', 'Shepherdson', 'retired', 'CIA', 'spy', 'who', 'called', 'cold', 'special', 'assignment', 'Shepherdson', 'paired', 'young', 'Harvard-educated', 'FBI', 'agent', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'senator', 'murder', 'signs', 'pointing', 'Soviet', 'assassin', 'named', 'Cassius', 'long', 'thought', 'be', 'dead.Is', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'tinged', 'remnants', 'hunts', 'cold-war', 'Soviet', 'moles', 'assassins', 'Well', 'Yes', 'No.THE', 'DOUBLE', 'attempt', 'producer', 'co-writer', 'Michael', 'Brandt', 'update', 'spy', 'thriller', 'trench', 'coats', 'too', 'many', 'secret', 'meetings', 'great', 'cast', 'led', 'Gere', 'Topper', 'Grace', 'young', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Castle', 'Stana', 'Katic', 'Russian', 'prostitute', 'do', ""n't"", 'blink', 'will', 'miss', 'performance', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'vampire', 'fame', 'scarred', 'thug', 'Cassius', 'follower', 'who', 'batteries', 'get', 'prison', 'also', 'propaganda', 'fake', 'border', 'police', 'killing', 'Mexicans.Filmed', 'Michigan', 'setting', 'often', 'panoramic', 'views', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Way', 'Out', 'Now', 'thought', 'Michael', 'Brandt', 'Cut', 'out', 'torrid', 'love', 'scenes', 'WAY', 'OUT', 'hunt', 'mole', 'named', 'Yuri', 'spy', 'vs', 'spy', 'Soviet', 'assassin', 'managed', 'suspense', 'nice', 'twist', 'end', 'pretty', 'well.Rent', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy.2.5', '5', 'stars']",N/A

1495710,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005NKIPUY,,"[0, 1]","There was a time when a movie with Richard Gere meant mega-box office success. It seems that Hollywood has taken to releasing his pictures much along the lines they do with aging actresses, delivering them straight to DVD rather than the big screen. That's a shame since Gere has rarely turned in a bad performance and the movies bypassing the big screen are often better than movies that make it there. THE DOUBLE is a good example.Gere portrays Paul Shepherdson, an ex-C.I.A. called out of retirement by his old boss, Tom Highland (Martin Sheen). It seems that years ago Paul was the lead agent in charge of tracking down a top Soviet assassin, a man known only as Cassius. When a U.S. Senator is killed using the same techniques as Cassius, it is believed that he has returned. Paul insists that he killed him years ago but no body was found.When Paul attends a joint meeting of the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., he asks why anyone would believe this is the work of Cassius. The man who brought this to the F.B.I.'s attention is their agent Ben Geary (Topher Grace). Geary has studied every piece of evidence concerning Cassius going to far as to write his thesis in college about the case. It is his belief that the recent murder shows signs that Cassius has returned.Paul and Geary are assigned to work together to find the evidence to prove or disprove that Cassius has returned and if he has to find him before he kills again. The pair follow up on clues and contacts in the hopes of finding anyone that can lead them to Cassius or at least information that would do so. And here's where a plot twist arrives early. I wouldn't actually call this a spoiler since it was revealed in the trailer, but the identity of Cassius is shown early on when he kills an ex-comrade that was in his group of assassins that Paul and Geary interview. Paul is Cassius.So now the whole mystery takes a different angle. Instead of two agents trying to find a killer the pair has one trying to find him and the other trying to remain hidden. And if Cassius wasn't the murderer of the Senator than who was? It is these questions that make this thriller more interesting than one would have expected.Shootouts, interviews and betrayals are found around every corner. Paul gets to meet Geary's family and warns his wife that the man her husband is trying to find is deadly and that it could put their family in danger. But Geary doggedly pursues each lead in the hopes of finding his man.So I said there was a spoiler right? Well perhaps not quite so. As I said, that was revealed in the trailer for the movie. There remains a twist in the story as it ends that will catch you completely off guard, not something easily done these days. And that's what makes this thriller one worth watching, along with the great performances.As I stated early on, there are so many films these days that make it to the theater and you wonder just who the folks behind it knew to get it released. At the same time a decent thriller like this one goes unnoticed. But that's the beauty of DVD. Movies that could have gone unnoticed have a chance to be seen and this is one of those movies that deserve it.",3,GERE AND GRACE AND A DECENT THRILLER,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,3163,"['was', 'time', 'when', 'movie', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'meant', 'mega-box', 'office', 'success', 'Hollywood', 'taken', 'releasing', 'pictures', 'much', 'lines', 'do', 'aging', 'actresses', 'delivering', 'straight', 'DVD', 'rather', 'big', 'screen', 'shame', 'Gere', 'rarely', 'turned', 'bad', 'performance', 'movies', 'bypassing', 'big', 'screen', 'are', 'often', 'better', 'movies', 'make', 'there', 'DOUBLE', 'good', 'example.Gere', 'portrays', 'Paul', 'Shepherdson', 'ex-C.I.A', 'called', 'retirement', 'old', 'boss', 'Tom', 'Highland', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'years', 'ago', 'Paul', 'was', 'lead', 'agent', 'charge', 'tracking', 'down', 'top', 'Soviet', 'assassin', 'man', 'known', 'only', 'Cassius', 'When', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'killed', 'using', 'same', 'techniques', 'Cassius', 'believed', 'returned', 'Paul', 'killed', 'years', 'ago', 'body', 'was', 'found.When', 'Paul', 'joint', 'meeting', 'C.I.A', 'F.B.I.', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'believe', 'work', 'Cassius', 'man', 'who', 'brought', 'F.B.I', 'attention', 'agent', 'Ben', 'Geary', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Geary', 'studied', 'piece', 'evidence', 'concerning', 'Cassius', 'going', 'far', 'write', 'thesis', 'college', 'case', 'belief', 'recent', 'murder', 'signs', 'Cassius', 'returned.Paul', 'Geary', 'are', 'assigned', 'work', 'together', 'find', 'evidence', 'prove', 'disprove', 'Cassius', 'returned', 'find', 'again', 'pair', 'follow', 'up', 'clues', 'contacts', 'hopes', 'finding', 'anyone', 'can', 'lead', 'Cassius', 'least', 'information', 'would', 'do', 'so', 'here', 'where', 'plot', 'twist', 'early', 'would', ""n't"", 'actually', 'call', 'spoiler', 'was', 'revealed', 'trailer', 'identity', 'Cassius', 'shown', 'early', 'when', 'ex-comrade', 'was', 'group', 'assassins', 'Paul', 'Geary', 'interview', 'Paul', 'Cassius.So', 'now', 'whole', 'mystery', 'different', 'angle', 'Instead', 'two', 'agents', 'trying', 'find', 'killer', 'pair', 'one', 'trying', 'find', 'other', 'trying', 'remain', 'hidden', 'Cassius', 'was', ""n't"", 'murderer', 'Senator', 'who', 'was', 'questions', 'make', 'thriller', 'more', 'interesting', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'expected.Shootouts', 'interviews', 'betrayals', 'are', 'found', 'corner', 'Paul', 'meet', 'Geary', 'family', 'wife', 'man', 'husband', 'trying', 'find', 'deadly', 'could', 'put', 'family', 'danger', 'Geary', 'doggedly', 'lead', 'hopes', 'finding', 'man.So', 'said', 'was', 'spoiler', 'right', 'Well', 'perhaps', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'said', 'was', 'revealed', 'trailer', 'movie', 'twist', 'story', 'will', 'catch', 'completely', 'guard', 'not', 'something', 'easily', 'done', 'days', 'what', 'thriller', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'great', 'performances.As', 'stated', 'early', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'days', 'make', 'theater', 'wonder', 'just', 'who', 'folks', 'knew', 'get', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'decent', 'thriller', 'one', 'unnoticed', 'beauty', 'DVD', 'Movies', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'unnoticed', 'have', 'chance', 'be', 'seen', 'one', 'movies', 'deserve']",N/A

His career has had ups and downs, and I don't know how he will be judged in cinema's history. But he has a charisma that is difficult to ignore, and you wish he could reach greater heights. This is what I felt when I watched ""The Double,"" an electrifying and intriguing film that will keep you glued to your seat until the very end.The film opens with the assassination of US Senator Dennis Darden (Ed Kelly), who we briefly see earlier on TV arguing with another senator about Russia's resurgence. We then meet Paul Shepherdson (Richard Gere), a retired CIA agent who is an expert on an extremely dangerous Russian spy by the codename of Cassius, who is suspected to be the senator's assassin. Shepherdson is informed by Tom Highland (Martin Sheen) that he will be partnered with Ben Geary (Topher Grace), who happens to be an FBI expert on Cassius, too. Shepherdson objects this decision, because Geary's experience on Cassius is only on paper, and he doesn't have the instinct to read or understand the soviet assassin. After a while, as you probably guessed, they get to work together. But that is when the story takes a quick turn, and we very early get to know who the real Cassius is, which entirely changes the dynamic of the film, making us guess until the film's final frame.I have always enjoyed great, non-formulaic, intelligent spy movies, and ""The Double"" is one of them.

It is difficult to figure out for a while if this is a good cop/bad cop set up or if this is a throwback to Cold War times. Written by Derek Haas and director Michael Brandt it is less a complex maze of twists and turns that the viewer feels it should be than a mixed salad of CIA, FBI, leftover characters from the Cold War trying to figure out where the film is going.The film opens with a view of a senator being murdered by a particular manner of cutting the throat that used to be the trademark of some Russian assassins, one in particular named Cassius.  But apparently retired CIA operative Paul Shepherdson (Richard Gere) killed that entire groups of assassins and it takes the intervention of a maverick Harvard grad turned FBI agent Ben Geary (Topher Grace) who did his thesis on Cassius to suggest that Cassius lives and is in Washington DC to kill CIA and FBI agents.  Fate pairs Shepherdson and Geary and the hunt begins with many men having their throats cut a la Cassius method until the evidence begins to fall together as to the truth behind it all. Telling more would destroy what little plot the film holds together.Gere and Grace are both fine if not memorable and they get some assistance form actors such as Martin Sheen, Steven Boyer, Tamer Hassan, and Odette Annable (a refreshing find!). The dialogue is pretty much drowned out by the noisy musical score and the ambient noise of the action.  Not a bad movie, just not a memorable one.

For the most part it's well acted and the pacing is what you would expect with car chases and fights dotted around every 15 minutes or so. Richard Gere is good as always even if the ""spy coming out of retirement"" routine is a little tired.I wonder if The Double was written 20-30 years ago - the style is more reminiscent of the spy genre from that era than the Jack Bauer heroes of today. There's no sex, swearing, running around on cell phones, demanding to be connected with the President, kidnapping the daughter, and so forth. Overall it feels very small scale given that a Senator has just been murdered and there's just a couple of guys in the government working it out (who both report to the of the whole thing). There are some fairly ludicrous plot holes along the way which you just have to ignore to keep the disbelief suspended.Still, it's a pretty enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours and doesn't deserve the horrible reviews it received.

If there were not enough crime elements to worry about for the average American (street gangs, Mexican drug cartels, inner-city crime wave, serial murderers, the Mafia, deranged mass killers), now we have to worry about Russian Assassins!The assassin in particular is a ghostly guy formerly working for the KGB, code-named Cassius.  Cassius put together a team of Russian assassins and controlled them from afar, back in the day (the Cold War).  Then he dissapeared for 20 years.  Richard Gere plays retired CIA operative Paul Shepherdson, who looked for Cassius and tried to kill his team of assassins in the '80s, and is now called out of retirement.  Topher Grace plays Ben Geary, a young nerdy FBI agaent with a wife and young family, who teams up with Gere to solve a Cassius-like murder of a US Senator.  Has the fiend Cassius resurfaced in the US? You see, Cassius has a nearly invincible knack to kill people with his ""wire around the neck"" technique:  very gruesome.  So when the Senator gets knocked off in similar manner, the CIA gives Topher and Gere the task of tracking Cassius down.  Then the dynamic duo get to bang heads with one Russian thug after another.The plot proceeds in a reasonable manner, until there are lots of twists, a sudden escalation of violence, and you don't know who is the good guy and who is the bad guy (hence the title).  There's a big twist at the movie's end (I won't tell it to you).Does this film, plot, premise and actors work for me?  Meh .... The premise of tons of scary Russian assassins infiltrating the US seems to me to be pushing credulity.  The premise of Cassius' invincibility and his method of killing also leaves me skeptical. But OK, even if I accept the premise, then I have some difficulty with fully accepting the turns & twists of the plot, especially Gere's character.  It's not that it's a bad plot, it just doesn't totally ring true for me.  Finally, I like Gere as an actor usually, but I just don't quite feel he measures up in action & dynamism for the role he's playing.  A credible job, yes, but another ""Meh"" feeling for the actors.  Which leads to a workmanlike ""3"" rating for this movie, worth the $2 to rent but that's about it.

Supporting roles are filled by Martin Sheen as the crusty CIA director; Stephen Moyer (TRUE BLOOD) as an imprisoned assassin who survived Gere's attack; Stana Katic (CASTLE) virtually wasted as a Russian hooker and Odette Yousman as Grace's librarian wife.Overall, THE DOUBLE is an entertaining espionage caper that will hold your interest.",4,GRACE GETS INTO GERE,1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,1086,"['Intricate', 'plotting', 'basis', 'engaging', 'political', 'thriller', 'Set', 'Washington', 'DC', 'filmed', 'Michigan', 'movie', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'retired', 'CIA', 'agent', 'called', 'back', 'duty', 'when', 'Russian', 'assassin', 'believed', 'be', 'killed', 'Gere', 'apparently', 'killed', 'US', 'senator', 'Gere', 'forced', 'work', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'track', 'down', 'notorious', 'assassin.A', 'key', 'plot', 'twist', 'surprisingly', 'revealed', 'early', 'indicating', 'even', 'bigger', 'twist', 'inevitable.Director', 'Michael', 'Brandt', 'things', 'moving', 'briskly', 'final', 'twist', 'little', 'far-fetched', 'satisfactory', 'conclusion.Gere', 'aged', 'well', 'solid', 'performance', 'Grace', 'most', 'noted', 'comic', 'actor', 'youthful', 'sincerity', 'role', 'Supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'filled', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'crusty', 'CIA', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'imprisoned', 'assassin', 'who', 'survived', 'Gere', 'attack', 'Stana', 'Katic', 'CASTLE', 'virtually', 'wasted', 'Russian', 'hooker', 'Odette', 'Yousman', 'Grace', 'librarian', 'wife.Overall', 'THE', 'DOUBLE', 'entertaining', 'espionage', 'caper', 'will', 'hold', 'interest']",N/A

Gere claims it is a copy cat killer and does not want to work with Topher.There is an early plot twist, something we get enough hints to clue us in. Even though Topher lacks field experience he is fairly savvy. As they seek out Cassius, bodies start to accumulate. Martin Sheen plays the head of the CIA. While an early mystery is solved for us, there are others that exist. There are action scenes, killings, and drama. I felt the acting brought the film down. Gere was wrong for that role. I really would have liked a hipper Travolta. I did enjoy the soundtrack, which was a mild Russian pagan metal with a good drum beat.  Makes for a decent spy drama rental. 3 1/2 stars.

When he is brought out of retirement and teamed with a young FBI agent Ben Geary (Grace) they must work together to solve the mystery and stop him before he kills again. I should start by saying that this is the type of movie I really like. Murder mysteries that involve the FBI, CIA and politics. I was looking forward to watching this for a while and I was not disappointed at all. There were enough twists in it to keep you guessing and by the end you aren't sure what to think anymore, just like a good movie should leave you. Besides the obvious all-star cast in this the movie is very well written and is very entertaining and fun to watch. Movies that keep you guessing are usually always that way though. I recommend this.

But I don't know if the story of ""The Double"" is really good from the beginning. Perhaps you may enjoy yourself watching it if you have nothing else to do, but I think when you finish watching this, you may find yourself scratching your head.Richard Gere is Paul Shepherdson, a retired agent. When a US senator is assassinated, Paul is called back into service by CIA director himself (Martin Sheen), who believes that a mysterious Soviet agent codenamed ""Cassius"" is back. Paul is ordered to track down the mysterious agent with a rookie FBI agent Geary (Topher Grace), who claims that he studied everything about Cassius. Even his master's thesis at Harvard was about him.Thrillers that start out like this usually require suspension of disbelief, but the story of ""The Double,"" which I admit has potential for a gripping spy thriller, needs better treatment. I'm not talking about who or where ""Cassius"" is; I'm talking about the incredible motives of characters (including the mysterious killer) involved in this convoluted story that goes on and on. Also, the film fails to give us details of the investigation of the two agents. What we get is instead the genre's conventions.""The Double"" is directed by Michael Brandt. Its screenplay is written by a writer team Derek Haas and Michael Brandt, both of whom are also co-writers of ""3:10 to Yuma"" (with Halsted Welles) and ""Wanted"" (with Chris Morgan). Sadly ""The Double"" has neither a character-driven drama of the former nor visuals of the latter.After all, ""The Double"" is mildly entertaining, but there is not much excitement.",2,Spy Thriller That Needs a More Coherent Story,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,1683,"['First', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'trailer', 'am', 'afraid', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'storyline', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'Double', 'really', 'good', 'beginning', 'Perhaps', 'may', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'think', 'when', 'finish', 'watching', 'may', 'find', 'scratching', 'head.Richard', 'Gere', 'Paul', 'Shepherdson', 'retired', 'agent', 'When', 'US', 'senator', 'assassinated', 'Paul', 'called', 'back', 'service', 'CIA', 'director', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'who', 'mysterious', 'Soviet', 'agent', 'codenamed', 'Cassius', 'back', 'Paul', 'ordered', 'track', 'down', 'mysterious', 'agent', 'rookie', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Geary', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'who', 'studied', 'everything', 'Cassius', 'Even', 'master', 'thesis', 'Harvard', 'was', 'him.Thrillers', 'start', 'usually', 'require', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'story', 'Double', 'admit', 'potential', 'gripping', 'spy', 'thriller', 'better', 'treatment', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'who', 'where', 'Cassius', ""'m"", 'talking', 'incredible', 'motives', 'characters', 'including', 'mysterious', 'killer', 'involved', 'convoluted', 'story', 'Also', 'film', 'give', 'details', 'investigation', 'two', 'agents', 'What', 'get', 'instead', 'genre', 'conventions', 'Double', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Brandt', 'screenplay', 'written', 'writer', 'team', 'Derek', 'Haas', 'Michael', 'Brandt', 'whom', 'are', 'also', 'co-writers', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'Halsted', 'Welles', 'Wanted', 'Chris', 'Morgan', 'Sadly', 'Double', 'character-driven', 'drama', 'former', 'visuals', 'latter.After', 'Double', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'not', 'much', 'excitement']",N/A

While it's not a great movie ""Double"" is a fairly clever spy thriller.Richard Gere plays Paul Shepherdson a CIA agent called out of retirement when the assassin code named Cassius that he killed appears to be killing political targets again taking out a U.S. Senator. Paired with Ben Geary a young FBI agent and analyst (Topher Grace)to track down Cassius and find out what exactly is going on and what his mission is. As Sheperdson and Geary dig a little deeper they become convinced that, perhaps, Cassius has branched out to become a serial killer.I've read many of the other reviews for this film and most of them complain about how preposterous the plot is and ho unrealistic the film is. Folks--it's a movie. It's no better or worse than a film like ""Salt"" (actually quite a good spy thriller with some interesting twists)and while it clearly didn't have quite the budget of that film the writer (with Derek Haas)-director Mark Brandt (""Wanted"", ""3:10 To Yuma"")does a fine job of staging the action and makes good use of a strong cast that includes Grace, Gere, Martin Sheen, Odette Annable and a solid string of supporting actors.The Blu-ray comes with a couple of featurettes, commentary track from the director and the theatrical trailer.Is it sometimes silly? Sure but then almost ALL spy thrillers can be pretty silly and preposterious at times which is WHY you have to suspend your disbelief.
