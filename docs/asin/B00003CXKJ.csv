527854,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXKJ,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I'm kind of glad that Brendan Fraser's career is over.  He was kind of bland and rather overrated and he just popped up everywhere for quite some time.  Okay, so his phenomenal performance in `Gods and Monsters' was kind of like ""OMG"" but he never once after that capitalized on his talent, so I have to conclude he didn't have much.  He wasn't really all that funny, and dramatically (outside of that fluke) he was rather painful.That is why I am glad that Elizabeth Hurley is so deliciously good in this movie.I have not seen the original, so I cannot compare and thus comment on their similarities or differences, but I can say that this film is a mixed bag.  When the jokes land, they land pretty well, but they fall flat a lot of the time as well, and the whole moral crux of the film isn't very well established or embellished.It's trashy fun, albeit hollow and pointless.Fraser plays Elliot, a dweeb trying to impress Alison, a co-worker who doesn't even notice him.  When he mutters something about selling his soul for a chance with her, he finds himself staring down the devil.  By devil, we mean a drool-worthy creation known as Elizabeth Hurley who offers Elliot seven wishes in exchange for his soul.  He's hesitant (who wouldn't be) but he eventually mans up and takes the deal.  The problem is, the Devil sure isn't going to play fair and so every wish comes at Elliot tainted with failure.Some of these scenarios are truly uproarious, but others tend to suffer from over thinking or no thinking at all.As far as the acting is concerned, Hurley is stunning and devilishly fun.  I loved her spin on the character, and while she at times was nothing more than a stereotypical caricature, she had a lot of fun with this and it showed in every scene.  Fraser is decent at best here, but he lacks any real range and comes off one-note at times.  He tries to expand himself within the realms of this comedic genre, but he's no Mike Myers and so his slapstick timing isn't as sharp and his ability to `transform' within this genre is stunted.  I love Frances O'Connor, and her performance is good here (she's not playing for laughs though), and I find Orlando Jones to be hilarious.Like I said, this is a mixed bag.In the end, I can recommend this for a first time viewing.  When it's funny, it's really funny and so that says something, and no one wants to miss Hurley, scantily clad and seductively bossy.  It doesn't really hold up and it doesn't go anywhere new (the base morale for this film really could make for a superb intellectual dramedy) but it embraces what it does best and sometimes that is all that matters.",3,Somewhere in the middle...,1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,2631,"[""'m"", 'kind', 'glad', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'career', 'over', 'was', 'kind', 'bland', 'rather', 'overrated', 'just', 'popped', 'up', 'everywhere', 'quite', 'time', 'Okay', 'phenomenal', 'performance', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'was', 'kind', 'OMG', 'never', 'once', 'capitalized', 'talent', 'have', 'conclude', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'funny', 'dramatically', 'fluke', 'was', 'rather', 'painful.That', 'why', 'am', 'glad', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'so', 'deliciously', 'good', 'movie.I', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'thus', 'comment', 'similarities', 'differences', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'mixed', 'bag', 'When', 'jokes', 'land', 'land', 'pretty', 'well', 'fall', 'flat', 'lot', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'whole', 'moral', 'crux', 'film', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'established', 'embellished.It', 'trashy', 'fun', 'hollow', 'pointless.Fraser', 'plays', 'Elliot', 'dweeb', 'trying', 'impress', 'Alison', 'co-worker', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'When', 'something', 'selling', 'soul', 'chance', 'staring', 'down', 'devil', 'devil', 'mean', 'drool-worthy', 'creation', 'known', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'who', 'Elliot', 'seven', 'wishes', 'exchange', 'soul', 'hesitant', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'eventually', 'up', 'deal', 'problem', 'Devil', 'sure', ""n't"", 'going', 'play', 'fair', 'so', 'wish', 'Elliot', 'tainted', 'failure.Some', 'scenarios', 'are', 'truly', 'uproarious', 'others', 'tend', 'suffer', 'thinking', 'thinking', 'all.As', 'far', 'acting', 'concerned', 'Hurley', 'stunning', 'devilishly', 'fun', 'loved', 'spin', 'character', 'times', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'stereotypical', 'caricature', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'showed', 'scene', 'Fraser', 'decent', 'best', 'here', 'real', 'range', 'off', 'one-note', 'times', 'expand', 'realms', 'comedic', 'genre', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'so', 'slapstick', 'timing', ""n't"", 'sharp', 'ability', 'transform', 'genre', 'stunted', 'love', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'performance', 'good', 'here', 'not', 'playing', 'laughs', 'find', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'be', 'hilarious.Like', 'said', 'mixed', 'bag.In', 'end', 'can', 'recommend', 'first', 'time', 'viewing', 'When', 'funny', 'really', 'funny', 'so', 'something', 'one', 'miss', 'Hurley', 'scantily', 'clad', 'seductively', 'bossy', ""n't"", 'really', 'hold', 'up', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'new', 'base', 'morale', 'film', 'really', 'could', 'make', 'superb', 'intellectual', 'dramedy', 'what', 'best', 'sometimes', 'matters']",Bedazzled
527855,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00003CXKJ,Andy Orrock,"[3, 3]","In my opinion, Brendan Fraser is one of this country's most underrated actors.Stop laughing.  Check out ""The Quiet American"" (where he's nothing short of incredible) and ""Gods and Monsters"" (going up and holding his own against Ian McKellen).  Then, he can go completely to other end of the range like the broad comedic skills he puts on display here in ""Bedazzled.""  Of course, it helps that he's directed by Harold Ramis, whose 80s trio of ""Caddyshack"" (sainthood alone for that), ""Stripes"" and ""Ghostbusters"" put him in some untouchable comedic pantheon.I'm not a bid E. Hurley fan, so - unlike some of the other reviewers here - I'll withhold commentary.  You could replace her with anyone, and the effect on the movie would be minor in my mind (well, I'd like to see Maxine Bahns in there, but that's a different thing altogether).But Fraser - this is a tour de force.  I'll point out one of the seven vignettes that make up this movie: his stint as a basketball player, in which his post-game courtside and locker room interviews savage every cliche and stereotype you've ever seen in those interactions.  When he's standing there with sweat flying off his body (giving new meaning to the term 'profusely') and spouting nothings (over and over) about ""giving 110%""...well, a thing of beauty really.

527861,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B00003CXKJ,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[0, 0]","In 2000, Harold Ramis (know by many as Egon Spengler in the Ghostbusters movies) released a funny and clever film called Bedazzled. Itself a remake of a 1968 Dudley Moore film of the same name, Ramis' Bedazzled stars Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley as dueling mortal and devil. The film shows that Ramis still had the skills to make very funny films, but it also helped showcase Fraser as a comedic leading man. But the film's scene-stealing performance has to be that of leading lady Elizabeth Hurley as a feminine-personafied Satan.The film has a simple enough premise. Fraser plays one Elliot Richards. He is a nebbish and socially-inept drone at a software company in San Francisco whose unrequited and secret crush for a beautiful co-worker leads him into the the ravishingly beautiful arms of the Prince of Darkness. Well, in this case it would be the Princess of Darkness. After a night where he's embarrassed and ridiculed by co-workers, Elliot makes an ill-fated wish to be able to love his secret love, Alison (played by Frances O'Connor) and willing to sell his soul to have it so. Thus enters Satan in all her sinfully glory.Playing Satan is British beauty Elizabeth Hurley who takes the role of Satan and runs with it. Her performance as the Devil is one that anyone, male or female, would easily sell and damn their souls for. It's a star-turning performance that really keeps the audience from starying from their seats. Ms. Hurley never looked more beautiful than she did in Bedazzled. Brendan Fraser more than holds his own against the tour-de-force that's Ms. Hurley's performance and there's definite chemistry between the two actors. In fact, their chemistry is so palpable that by film's end one would rather Elliot and the She-Devil end up together than with Alison. One funny thing I noticed was that in every scene Ms. Hurley was in she had a different outfit everytime. Each and every one more revealing and sexy than the next. Worth the price of admission, at the least.The film itself uses the seven wishes Satan grants to Elliot as a way to give Fraser many different personas to show his acting and comedic chops. One wish has him becoming a very powerful and rich man who happens to be a drug-lord. Another has him being a loving and sensitive man who happens to be so sensitive that he's become almost female. He even wishes to be a famous and talented athlete and thus becomes one but lacking ""size"" where it counts. All these wishes puts a new spin on the saying ""be careful what you wish for"" and each wish gets mined for comedy gold at every turn. One thing I'd like to point out would be the funny performance of Orlando Jones as one of Elliot's co-workers who also end up appearing as someone else in each of his wishes. If it wasn't for Elizabeth Hurley's performance, Orlando Jones would be the one stealing each and every scene he's in.All in all, Bedazzled was a very good film that was kept from becoming too campy and episodic with its set-pieces by the performances of Hurley, Fraser and Jones. Ramis may have slowed down abit in the last decade or so with his filmmaking but this film shows that he's lost none of his skills in crafting a funny, clever and, ultimately, entertaining film that aspires for nothing else but to be that.",4,"A clever, funny and entertaining remake",984614400,"03 15, 2001",2001,3282,"['2000', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'know', 'many', 'Egon', 'Spengler', 'Ghostbusters', 'movies', 'released', 'funny', 'clever', 'film', 'called', 'Bedazzled', 'remake', '1968', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'Ramis', 'Bedazzled', 'stars', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'dueling', 'mortal', 'devil', 'film', 'Ramis', 'still', 'had', 'skills', 'make', 'very', 'funny', 'films', 'also', 'helped', 'showcase', 'Fraser', 'comedic', 'leading', 'man', 'film', 'scene-stealing', 'performance', 'be', 'leading', 'lady', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'feminine-personafied', 'Satan.The', 'film', 'simple', 'enough', 'premise', 'Fraser', 'one', 'Elliot', 'Richards', 'nebbish', 'socially-inept', 'drone', 'software', 'company', 'San', 'Francisco', 'unrequited', 'secret', 'crush', 'beautiful', 'co-worker', 'ravishingly', 'beautiful', 'arms', 'Prince', 'Darkness', 'Well', 'case', 'would', 'be', 'Princess', 'Darkness', 'night', 'where', 'embarrassed', 'ridiculed', 'co-workers', 'Elliot', 'ill-fated', 'wish', 'be', 'able', 'love', 'secret', 'love', 'Alison', 'played', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'willing', 'sell', 'soul', 'have', 'so', 'Thus', 'enters', 'Satan', 'sinfully', 'glory.Playing', 'Satan', 'British', 'beauty', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'who', 'role', 'Satan', 'performance', 'Devil', 'one', 'anyone', 'male', 'female', 'would', 'easily', 'sell', 'damn', 'souls', 'star-turning', 'performance', 'really', 'audience', 'starying', 'seats', 'Ms.', 'Hurley', 'never', 'looked', 'more', 'beautiful', 'did', 'Bedazzled', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'more', 'own', 'tour-de-force', 'Ms.', 'Hurley', 'performance', 'definite', 'chemistry', 'two', 'actors', 'fact', 'chemistry', 'so', 'palpable', 'film', 'end', 'one', 'would', 'rather', 'Elliot', 'She-Devil', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'Alison', 'One', 'funny', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'scene', 'Ms.', 'Hurley', 'was', 'had', 'different', 'outfit', 'everytime', 'one', 'more', 'revealing', 'sexy', 'next', 'price', 'admission', 'least.The', 'film', 'seven', 'wishes', 'Satan', 'grants', 'Elliot', 'way', 'give', 'Fraser', 'many', 'different', 'personas', 'show', 'acting', 'comedic', 'chops', 'One', 'wish', 'becoming', 'very', 'powerful', 'rich', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'drug-lord', 'being', 'loving', 'sensitive', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'so', 'sensitive', 'become', 'almost', 'female', 'even', 'be', 'famous', 'talented', 'athlete', 'thus', 'one', 'lacking', 'size', 'where', 'wishes', 'new', 'spin', 'saying', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'wish', 'mined', 'comedy', 'gold', 'turn', 'One', 'thing', ""'d"", 'like', 'point', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'performance', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'one', 'Elliot', 'co-workers', 'who', 'also', 'end', 'up', 'appearing', 'someone', 'else', 'wishes', 'was', ""n't"", 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'performance', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'stealing', 'scene', 'in.All', 'Bedazzled', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'kept', 'becoming', 'too', 'campy', 'episodic', 'set-pieces', 'performances', 'Hurley', 'Fraser', 'Jones', 'Ramis', 'may', 'have', 'slowed', 'down', 'abit', 'last', 'decade', 'so', 'filmmaking', 'film', 'lost', 'none', 'skills', 'crafting', 'funny', 'clever', 'ultimately', 'entertaining', 'film', 'nothing', 'else', 'be']",Bedazzled

It's silly and just requires someone to take on a few different roles withing the same movie. Bedazzled has always been one of my favourite movies as I'm a fan of silly comedy that at least has a point. The point of this movie? Well, I'm not really sure but I know there's one in there somewhere. After all, if you have a movie where the devil is played by one of the sexiest women in the world, there has to be a message in that movie. I'm thinking the scene set in the classroom in which Satan is a sexy teacher with a fetching belt... Sorry skirt.Back to the movie. Fraser plays Elliot Richards, a lovable loser who really needs to catch a break. He's after the heart of one of his co-workers, Alison (Frances O'Connor) ((I know, she's terrible)) she doesn't notice him and probably doesn't even realise he exists. Elliot decides that the only way in which he can get Alison is to sell his soul to the devil. The only real problem is, that Satan is sexy, not just sexy but smoking hot. I guess that could be called ironic. The Devil's played by Liz Hurley by the way. Instead of just taking his soul for Alison, she instead offers him 7 wishes which place him in crazy situations that all give him the opportunity to win Alison over. He becomes a Basketball superstar, a drug lord and a gay academic.This is a really good movie with effects that are done very well indeed.

People used to laugh at me when I said this just a few years ago but they are saying it less these days. His biggest gift is one of range.  He can play an astonishing range of roles from comedic to dramatic to romantic and even on to disturbed.  He does them all well. The one thing he needs to get better at though is picking his film vehicles. He is wasting a lot of his talent on not well enough written screenplays and/or costars who don't have enough talent.  If you think I have lost my mind regarding my praise of this actor's potential, I typically silence all doubters by getting them to watch him in &quot;Gods &amp; Monsters,&quot; a superb film in every particular.  &quot;Bedazzled&quot; shows both Fraser's strengths and weaknesses.  He does a good job of playing Elliot Richards, a nerdish San Francisco computer employee, who tries to fit in with his co-workers and fails miserably. He then gets an opportunity by the devil, played by Elizabeth Hurley, to play out 7 life fantasies in exchange for his soul. It is in the playing out of these fantasies where you can see some of Fraser's terrific comedic ability.  These range from a Columbian drug lord to an athletic star to a rock star to a sensitive guy to a gay man.  These sequences were genuinely funny and even touching in places.  The weaknesses: his costars, as usual, are way too weak as foils for him.  Elizabeth Hurley as the devil really plays what she is, a beautiful model. (One really wonders where she is going to be in 5-10 years and I can't imagine it being any place good.)

As I watched those past comedic monsters, I felt a little sorry for Fraser.  It wasn't his fault those movies suffered, and yet he often got the bad rap for their failures.  Bedazzled gives Fraser good direction (courtesy of Ramis), a decent screenplay (by Ramis, Peter Tolan, and Larry Gelbhart), and talented co-stars (you won't see Alicia Silverstone on the cast list) to work off of, and Fraser is at the top of his game, proving to be a real comedic talent.Bedazzled follows the overused but always appealing movie premise of man who sells his soul to the devil.  In this film, the man is Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) an irritating, unpopular office worker who won't stop trying to make friends with his annoyed co-workers (Toby Huss, Miriam Shor, Paul Adelstein, and Orlando Jones) until they are forced to flat-out reject him.  To make Elliot's situation even more pathetic, the object of his nerdy passions, Alison (Frances O'Connor) isn't interested in him at all.  As Alison politely brushes him off in a bar, he mutters under his breath ""Man, I'd do anything to have that girl in my life.""  Poof The Devil (Elizabeth Hurley) appears and promises to grant Elliot seven wishes if he sells his soul.  He agrees and the fun begins as we watch each of Elliot's wishes, centered around his desire for Alison, become sabotaged by the Devil.  For instance, wishing to be rich, powerful, and married to Alison, Elliot is turned into a Colombian drug lord, and his wife, a Latin version of Alison, is cheating on him.  His second wish to be the world's most sensitive man turns out to be a disaster as a blonde Alison finds his undying devotion boring.I got a kick out of watching these very gifted comedic actors transform their personalities and their physical appearances as they go from wish to wish.  Fraser, O'Connor, and the co-workers each play six different characters, while Elizabeth Hurley has to endure countless costume and hair changes as many as five times during a single scene.Fraser, Adelstein, Jones, and especially Toby Huss are hilarious (his mumbling sportscaster and token gay guy are the highlights of the film) Ramis competently directs; Elizabeth Hurley shows off impressive range (if she chose more dramatic roles, I think she would surpise a lot of people) and O'Connor is an engaging love interest.

527890,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00003CXKJ,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[9, 11]","Bedazzled is a surprisingly smart, genuinely funny movie about the wishes we all make and the fallacy of our belief that wealth, fame, love, etc., will truly make us happy.  Taking the Dr. Faust theme to unheard of heights, the devil takes the form of Elizabeth Hurley who is indeed constantly bedazzling in a long list of outfits taken straight from the minds of adolescent teenaged boys (and a few of us who used to be adolescent teenaged boys).  Gorgeously naughty, she is the epitome of temptation.  Brendan Fraser gives a terrific performance as seven characters all wrapped up in one.  Elliot Richards is a socially inept computer nerd who is not even very good at being a loser.  He tries way too hard to make friends, and he even does the one thing that losers must never, ever do: admitting his crush on a woman who doesn't even know him.  This leads to public embarrassment, as I could easily have told the guy, and soon Elliot unwittingly dial's Satan's number by saying he would give anything to have Alison Gardner (Frances O'Connor) in his life.  Elizabeth Hurley looks nothing at all like the traditional devil, but she has comparatively little trouble convincing Elliot of her identity and getting him to sell his soul in exchange for seven wishes; I mean, what guy wouldn't give in to the seductive delights of Elizabeth Hurley?You really have to be specific when you are making wishes, as Elliot soon learns as a series of fantasies fulfilled quickly fall through: fame, power, and marriage to Allison is dangerous as well as unfulfilling, the life of an unbelievable star athlete comes with its own little problem (wink, wink), intelligence and savoir faire misses the mark, and becoming the most sensitive man on earth is quite simply a big mistake.  Elliot, his sweetie Allison, and his co-workers all appear in these separate wish-fulfilled lives, each actor adopting a number of very different roles over the course of the film.  The results can be hilarious, and there was at least one surprising wish fulfillment that never appeared in any trailer.  Fraser has always seemed to be something of a stiff actor to me, but he shows great versatility in his performance here, taking the challenge of his role and running with it.  Frances O'Connor is an increasingly sweet delight, as well, and Elizabeth Hurley is simply fantastic and utterly enchanting.There are lots of special features on the DVD.  Besides a theatrical trailer and several TV spots, you get two commentaries by the director and actors (including Hurley), a quite impressive featurette hosted by Hurley herself on the making of the film, a still gallery, and a look at the impressive costuming that went into the making of the film.  Best of all, though, you get an extended scene of six minutes featuring Orlando Jones and Toby Huss offering post-game commentary after Elliot's amazing NBA debut.  The scene is hilarious in the movie, but the extended scene takes the hilarity to absurdly funny levels.  Every so often, you can hear a direction pointing the guys toward a certain type of comment on the game, but Jones and Huss seem to be ad libbing the entire commentary, constantly outdoing one another with some truly inane babblings.  The only thing that disappointed me about this Special Edition DVD was a lack of deleted scenes.

527893,A36L1F0YECOAW8,B00003CXKJ,David Grant,"[9, 11]","'Bedazzled' is kind of a comedic 'Tales From The Crypt'. It's split into 4 small vignettes almost with one main story to hold it together. Each 'vignette' is hit-or-miss but each provides Brendan Fraser to step out from behind his goody-boy persona and try something completely different. This is his most assured work since 'The Mummy' and he makes the best of it, carrying the weight of this severly flawed film on his more-than-capable shoulders. The Devil (played by the impossibly beautiful but inept Elizabeth Hurley) offers Elliot (Fraser) seven wishes in exchange for his soul. All he wants is to be with the girl he's love for four years, Alison (Frances O'Connor) but has never spoken to. Each wish involves Fraser trying to pin down exactly what type of man she wants. Then reacting in horror as each wish goes terribly wrong. When he wishes to be rich and powerful and married to Alison, the Devil turns him into a Mexican drug lord whose wife cheats on him. When he wishs to be a handsome, smart young man, the Devil complies making him ravishing and witty and homosexual (I didn't know being smart and good-looking instantly made you gay but OK). This is the formula and it is repeated over and over until the completely unconvincing and utterly ridiculous ending. But still Fraser does his job wonderfully proving that he is a brilliant comedic actor. Director Harold Ramis has seen better days but does manage to give a good and informative commentary track for the DVD. So, if you like something light-weight and without a shred of conviction, you'll love this movie. All others will simply appreciate Brendan Fraser's great performance(s) and weep that he ends up in films like this instead of being what he should be.

527900,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXKJ,D. Litton,"[1, 2]","Elizabeth Hurley was an ideal choice for the role of Satan in &quot;Bedazzled,&quot; opposite Brendan Fraser, who is also well cast as a misfit who offers his soul in return for seven wishes. The movie is a remake of an original film, and while it may tend to drag down a bit in its final acts, the result is a comedy tour-de-force which had me laughing and feeling pleased throughout.What more pathetic character could we ask for in Elliott, the computer technician with no life? Elliott has no friends, but that doesn't stop him from conversing with his coworkers whom he thinks are actually listening. When his attention becomes snagged by fellow coworker Allison, her rejection brings him to the attention of a mysterious woman in red who reveals herself to be the Princess of Darkness. Her plan: to offer him seven wishes in return for his soul, and while he remains skeptical, the thought of being with Allison (with the help of Satan's television screens) drives him to accept the offer.This is where the movie gets good, as we follow him on his many adventures accompanying each of his wishes. His first wish, to be rich and have Allison for his wife, lands him as a Spanish cocaine dealer whose wife is cheating on him with her English teacher, followed by his second wish to be emotionally sensitive, which drives Allison into the arms of a shallow man (&quot;I just want someone who wants to get in my pants&quot;). Elliott soon catches on to Satan's tricks, yet still keeps taking his wishes, with hilarious results.First and foremost, the performances from Hurley and Fraser are what make the movie worthwhile. Brendan Fraser looks like he's having so much fun playing his role, segueing from a fast-talking Mexican who speaks multiple languages, to the overtly sensitive red-haired boy who bursts into tears at the glance of the sunset. Hurley gives a smashing performance as a female Satan, her accent adding wit and charisma to a role that is being dealt with in a new way. In watching &quot;Bedazzled,&quot; I could see how much fun the two actors were having in playing their roles, which made the movie more enjoyable and the comedy more comfortable.That comedy arises from many different things: first, there's the relationship between the two characters. Satan knows that she's not going to live up to her promises entirely without flaw, which leads to some very funny results as Elliott discovers each wish's put-off. I also found a great many laughs during the opening sequence, which singles people out in the frantic pace of life and labels them with a certain flaw. Add a bit of witty dialogue and a goofy character on his way to his dreams, and what you've got is a reasonably successful film which delivers what it was intended to: laughs.Which is why the ending, for me, doesn't quite live up to the rest of the material. The laughs seem to fizzle out a bit: they're still a couple of chuckle-worthy moments at hand, but not on par with the hysterics of the first two thirds of the movie. I originally intended to dispute the way in which the movie &quot;cops out&quot; by taking the approach it does in the end, but once I thought about it (and you'll understand me when you watch it yourself), there really was no other way for it to end and still retain a certain lightheartedness.On a slightly off-the-subject opinion, I also felt that the film had a good advertising plan going for it. The preview trailers don't give away all the laughs, and the movie takes certain turns that we don't get to see in the ads.All-in-all, &quot;Bedazzled&quot; is a regular comedy made just a touch better by the bright and vivacious performances of its leads. The fun they have in creating their characters' body and verbal language is laugh-out-loud funny, while the situations they find themselves in aren't original, but still have comedic charm.",4,A good ol' time at the movies.,989798400,"05 14, 2001",2001,3866,"['Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'was', 'ideal', 'choice', 'role', 'Satan', 'quot', 'Bedazzled', 'quot', 'opposite', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'who', 'also', 'well', 'cast', 'misfit', 'who', 'soul', 'return', 'seven', 'wishes', 'movie', 'remake', 'original', 'film', 'may', 'tend', 'drag', 'down', 'bit', 'final', 'acts', 'result', 'comedy', 'tour-de-force', 'had', 'laughing', 'feeling', 'pleased', 'throughout.What', 'more', 'pathetic', 'character', 'could', 'ask', 'Elliott', 'computer', 'technician', 'life', 'Elliott', 'friends', ""n't"", 'stop', 'conversing', 'coworkers', 'whom', 'are', 'actually', 'listening', 'When', 'attention', 'becomes', 'snagged', 'fellow', 'coworker', 'Allison', 'rejection', 'attention', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'red', 'who', 'be', 'Princess', 'Darkness', 'plan', 'offer', 'seven', 'wishes', 'return', 'soul', 'skeptical', 'thought', 'being', 'Allison', 'help', 'Satan', 'television', 'screens', 'accept', 'offer.This', 'where', 'movie', 'good', 'follow', 'many', 'adventures', 'accompanying', 'wishes', 'first', 'wish', 'be', 'rich', 'have', 'Allison', 'wife', 'Spanish', 'cocaine', 'dealer', 'wife', 'cheating', 'English', 'teacher', 'followed', 'second', 'wish', 'be', 'emotionally', 'sensitive', 'Allison', 'arms', 'shallow', 'man', 'quot', 'just', 'want', 'someone', 'who', 'get', 'pants', 'quot', 'Elliott', 'soon', 'catches', 'Satan', 'tricks', 'yet', 'still', 'taking', 'wishes', 'hilarious', 'results.First', 'foremost', 'performances', 'Hurley', 'Fraser', 'are', 'make', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'playing', 'role', 'segueing', 'fast-talking', 'Mexican', 'who', 'multiple', 'languages', 'overtly', 'sensitive', 'red-haired', 'boy', 'who', 'tears', 'glance', 'sunset', 'Hurley', 'smashing', 'performance', 'female', 'Satan', 'accent', 'adding', 'wit', 'charisma', 'role', 'being', 'dealt', 'new', 'way', 'watching', 'quot', 'Bedazzled', 'quot', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'two', 'actors', 'were', 'having', 'playing', 'roles', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'comedy', 'more', 'comfortable.That', 'comedy', 'arises', 'many', 'different', 'things', 'first', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters', 'Satan', 'not', 'going', 'live', 'up', 'promises', 'entirely', 'flaw', 'very', 'funny', 'results', 'Elliott', 'wish', 'put-off', 'also', 'found', 'great', 'many', 'laughs', 'opening', 'sequence', 'people', 'out', 'frantic', 'pace', 'life', 'labels', 'certain', 'flaw', 'Add', 'bit', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'goofy', 'character', 'way', 'dreams', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'reasonably', 'successful', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'laughs.Which', 'why', 'ending', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'rest', 'material', 'laughs', 'seem', 'fizzle', 'out', 'bit', ""'re"", 'still', 'couple', 'chuckle-worthy', 'moments', 'hand', 'not', 'par', 'hysterics', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'movie', 'originally', 'intended', 'dispute', 'way', 'movie', 'quot', 'out', 'quot', 'taking', 'approach', 'end', 'once', 'thought', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'when', 'watch', 'really', 'was', 'other', 'way', 'end', 'still', 'retain', 'certain', 'lightheartedness.On', 'slightly', 'off-the-subject', 'opinion', 'also', 'felt', 'film', 'had', 'good', 'advertising', 'plan', 'going', 'preview', 'trailers', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'laughs', 'movie', 'certain', 'turns', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'ads.All-in-all', 'quot', 'Bedazzled', 'quot', 'regular', 'comedy', 'made', 'just', 'touch', 'better', 'bright', 'vivacious', 'performances', 'leads', 'fun', 'have', 'creating', 'characters', 'body', 'verbal', 'language', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'situations', 'find', 'are', ""n't"", 'original', 'still', 'have', 'comedic', 'charm']",Bedazzled

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[58, 65]","Way, way too many comparisons to the original version of this film, which is a shame:  BEDAZZLED stands wonderfully and beautifully on its own merits.  Directed by comedic genius Harold Ramis, this is a fast-paced, well-crafted, highly imaginative, hilarious film.  Heck, even my accountant laughs at this one, which is saying something.Based on the tried and true Faustian theme of selling one's soul to the devil, BEDAZZLED introduces us to hapless Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser), whose mediocre existence revolves around getting Alison, an attractive coworker (played by Frances O'Connor) to notice him, let alone go out with him.  In desperation, Elliot offers to sell his soul to obtain Alison's affection, and the devil responds.But this isn't just any ol' devil.  This is a heart-palpitating, traffic stopping, bark at the moon Elizabeth Hurley, who makes a most lusty Lucifer, and who wears enough revealing outfits to pack a heart trauma center.  Hurley's devil is seductive, playful, and of course delightfully wicked.  She grants Elliot seven wishes to win over Alison, but she's ingenious enough to turn each optimistic wish into a disaster.  For example:  Elliot wishes to be a rich and powerful businessman, married to Alison; the devil grants his wish, only Elliot is a South American drug lord, hated by his wife and under siege from all sides.  Each wish--no matter how carefully Elliot thinks he has covered all the bases--blows up in his face, to the blissful delight of the viewer.What really impressed me was Fraser himself.  Before seeing this film, I had placed the actor into the Stallone category of mutton heads, but Fraser very pleasantly surprised.

527902,A3VQLTB724O77W,B00003CXKJ,Dr. Christopher Coleman,"[1, 2]","I've not seen the original, so I can't compare the two, but this update was a fairly clever light movie, played strictly for laughs.  Elizabeth Hurley must be the most benign devil ever imagined--although she does make Brendan Fraser's wishes go astray, she also gives him a pager (press 666) which allows him to return to his normal existance without harm.  It's quite a different take on ol' Satan, and although at one point she loses her temper, that's the only threatening moment.  Eternal damnation seems more like a party that's gone on a little too long than Dante's grim visions of torment.  Although making theological arguements surely wasn't its intent, Beelzebub's portrayal as a trickster rather than a torturer is intriguing.  Satan's origin as an angel created by God himself and therefore an aspect of God himself is appropriate for the complex world in which we live.  Hurley's devil is not Evil incarnate, and indeed, at one point she appears as an angel in white with wings and halo, although she says &quot;Don't get excited, it's just a Halloween costume.&quot;  And most theologically interesting is the statement by one particular character to the effect that it didn't matter if someone sells their soul, because a person's soul isn't theirs to sell.  The implication here, although it wasn't followed up because it would have made the ending moot, is that Satan is ultimately powerless--powerless to collect the debt, and powerless to prevail over God's love.  Indeed, ultimately Satan is just another of God's creatures, working to God's mysterious purpose.That said, convervative Christians are most likely to disagree with me and will probably despise every minute of this movie.  They are likely to take one of two interpretations: that this movie glorifies the devil, or conversely, that it falsely and dangerously obscures his evil powers.Myself, I mostly thought it was a pretty funny movie.",3,Enjoyable Frolic with the &quot;Devil&quot; (?),980208000,"01 23, 2001",2001,1923,"[""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'update', 'was', 'fairly', 'clever', 'light', 'movie', 'played', 'strictly', 'laughs', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'must', 'be', 'most', 'benign', 'devil', 'ever', 'imagined', 'make', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'wishes', 'go', 'astray', 'also', 'pager', 'press', '666', 'return', 'normal', 'existance', 'harm', 'quite', 'different', 'take', 'ol', 'Satan', 'one', 'point', 'temper', 'only', 'threatening', 'moment', 'Eternal', 'damnation', 'more', 'party', 'gone', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'Dante', 'grim', 'visions', 'torment', 'making', 'theological', 'arguements', 'surely', 'was', ""n't"", 'intent', 'Beelzebub', 'portrayal', 'trickster', 'rather', 'torturer', 'intriguing', 'Satan', 'origin', 'angel', 'created', 'God', 'therefore', 'aspect', 'God', 'appropriate', 'complex', 'world', 'live', 'Hurley', 'devil', 'not', 'Evil', 'incarnate', 'indeed', 'one', 'point', 'angel', 'white', 'wings', 'halo', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'excited', 'just', 'Halloween', 'costume.', 'quot', 'most', 'theologically', 'interesting', 'statement', 'one', 'particular', 'character', 'effect', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'someone', 'soul', 'person', 'soul', ""n't"", 'theirs', 'sell', 'implication', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'followed', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'ending', 'moot', 'Satan', 'ultimately', 'powerless', 'powerless', 'collect', 'debt', 'powerless', 'prevail', 'God', 'love', 'Indeed', 'ultimately', 'Satan', 'just', 'God', 'creatures', 'working', 'God', 'mysterious', 'purpose.That', 'said', 'convervative', 'Christians', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'disagree', 'will', 'probably', 'despise', 'minute', 'movie', 'are', 'likely', 'take', 'one', 'two', 'interpretations', 'movie', 'devil', 'conversely', 'falsely', 'dangerously', 'evil', 'powers.Myself', 'mostly', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'movie']",Bedazzled

She dons an assortment of sexy outfits from bikinis to cheerleader costumes and she looks TERRIFIC in all of them!  While I'm not sure how far her acting abilities will take her, that all seems a moot point in this flick.For those who are fishing for something beyond an eyeful of Hurley, the feature also offers some additional attributes.  For one, we have a comedic rendition of the Faustian myth.  This time around we have Hurley portraying the sexiest Mephistophles ever (OK, technically she plays the Devil herself).  Instead of Margareta we have Alison (played by Frances O'Connor).Surprisingly enough, the cast does a credible job of creating a pretty funny movie out of what once was a very dark story.  The religious imagery throughout the film is all tounge-in-cheek & is basically a parody of Catholicism.  Beware: this movie is sure to offend a great many right-wing believers.  If you happen to fall into this category then I would not recommend this movie.The story of Faust used to be a bit of an urban legend that was later penned by Christopher Marlowe.  Later on, in the 19th century a different (and far lengthier) version of the myth was written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.  In the 20th century the tale was told for the first time in prose form (instead of poetry), courtesy of one Thomas Mann.  Presently it appears that Mann has passed the torch on to Elizabeth Hurley, and this is sure to be the sexiest FAUST ever!",5,Careful what you wish for...,1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,1529,"['are', '3', 'main', 'reasons', 'watch', 'movie', 'are', 'Hurley', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'assortment', 'sexy', 'outfits', 'bikinis', 'cheerleader', 'costumes', 'TERRIFIC', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'far', 'acting', 'abilities', 'will', 'take', 'moot', 'point', 'flick.For', 'who', 'are', 'fishing', 'something', 'eyeful', 'Hurley', 'feature', 'also', 'additional', 'attributes', 'one', 'have', 'comedic', 'rendition', 'Faustian', 'myth', 'time', 'have', 'Hurley', 'portraying', 'sexiest', 'Mephistophles', 'ever', 'OK', 'technically', 'Devil', 'herself', 'Instead', 'Margareta', 'have', 'Alison', 'played', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", '.Surprisingly', 'enough', 'cast', 'credible', 'job', 'creating', 'pretty', 'funny', 'movie', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'very', 'dark', 'story', 'religious', 'imagery', 'film', 'tounge-in-cheek', 'basically', 'parody', 'Catholicism', 'Beware', 'movie', 'sure', 'offend', 'great', 'many', 'right-wing', 'believers', 'happen', 'fall', 'category', 'then', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie.The', 'story', 'Faust', 'used', 'be', 'bit', 'urban', 'legend', 'was', 'later', 'penned', 'Christopher', 'Marlowe', 'Later', '19th', 'century', 'different', 'far', 'lengthier', 'version', 'myth', 'was', 'written', 'Johann', 'Wolfgang', 'von', 'Goethe', '20th', 'century', 'tale', 'was', 'told', 'first', 'time', 'prose', 'form', 'instead', 'poetry', 'courtesy', 'one', 'Thomas', 'Mann', 'Presently', 'Mann', 'passed', 'torch', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'sure', 'be', 'sexiest', 'FAUST', 'ever']",Bedazzled

The story is a lighthearted Faustian parody where a geek named Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) sells his soul to the devil (Elizabeth Hurley) in exchange for seven wishes.  Consistent with the maxim, ""Be careful what you wish for"", Elliot's wishes bring him numerous unintended and droll consequences.Harold Ramis has written and directed some classic comedies (""Animal House"", ""Caddyshack"", ""Ghostbusters"", ""Groundhog Day""), but this material comes nowhere near the standard set by his earlier films.  The film is a showcase for Brendan Fraser, who is funny, but not hilarious.Fraser's performance is hit or miss.  Some of his portrayals are very humorous and some fall flat.  He is better when he is playing the sincere buffoon than when he is trying to render some bizarre caricature.  Not much is asked of Elizabeth Hurley (""Austin Powers"") by this screenplay.  She needed to be beautiful, sexy and naughty, which isn't much of a stretch for her.  Frances O'Connor (""Mansfield Park"") has an equally undemanding role as Elliot's love interest, being more of an object than an integral part of the film.

Besides, I'm a Brendan Fraser fan.The movie didn't disappoint.  As you probably already know, Fraser stars as an IT nerd who agrees to sell his soul to the Devil (Hurley) in return for seven wishes so he can get the girl of his dream (O'Connor).  Only five wishes are really played out (not counting the stupid &quot;I wish I had a Big Mac and Coke&quot; gimmick), and each one has a funny twist.  Fraser totally excels as his typical funny-as-monkey performance.  The first &quot;rich and powerful&quot; wish is by far the best of the five, with a nice make-up job, too.  The others have their funny moments, but all leave something more to be desired by the audience.Hurley is a bit disappointing.  She looks old and not really that hot.

What it is, however, is an ejoyable romp featuring top-notch performances in Brendan Fraser and Elisabeth Hurley. This flick features Fraser as a sweet,put-upon nerdy office worker, who has a serious crush on a girl at work and who is basically treated as an outcast to be avoided by his fellow employees. After another day of humiliation, he meets a sexy devil (Hurley) who offers him 7 wishes in exchange for his soul. What happens next are very funny takes on the old &quot; be careful what you wish for&quot; axiom. Fraser is very funny in his various roles and his performance provides a solid center to this film. Elisabeth Hurley is obviously having a blast in a role tailor-made for her, and her sex appeal is put to great use here. Of course, not all the comic bits work completely, but they still are amusing, while the more successful ones are gut-busting funny.

Second, shouldn't a person beware of what he wishes for? A very lonely nerdy man with terrible inter-personal skills, who repeatedly makes inappropriate comments in his clumsy attempts to ingratiate himself with people, is in love with a woman who works where he works, but who ignores him. He is approached by an extremely attractive woman in a tight red dress and an English accent who tells him she is the devil and will fulfill seven of his wishes if he signs a four inch thick contract which sells her his soul. As we can expect, although he gets exactly what he wishes, there are always things that he did not request that spoil his wish. An example is his first wish to be rich and married to the woman he loves. His wish is ruined because his wife despises and is committing adultery, and he is rich because he is a drug dealer whose business is threatened by other gangsters who want to take it over.

The film is like an adult version of 7 wishes from the soul catcher, a remake of the old 1967 favourite. As it may not be as plausible as the original, this is still darned good stuff, a highly recommendable piece of comedic viewing.Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser), a socially incompetent technical advisor working at a call-center, has had a crush on Alison Gardner (Frances O'Connor) for nearly four years. One evening, which already started particularly bad for Elliot, she ditches him. Elliot wishes for her to be in his life with all his heart - and is heard. An incredibly beautiful young lady addresses Elliot, and after introducing herself as the Devil, Lucifer, the Princess of Darkness (Elizabeth Hurley), she offers him a deal: Seven wishes for him, his Soul for her. Quickly, Elliot is convinced and accepts. But every wish he gets fulfilled has massive disadvantages as well, and soon Elliot wants to get out of the contract. The only thing that matters to him now is being able to take his chances by himself.Indeed, Bedazzled is not the perfect film. It drags on towards the end, the jokes are sometimes largely unfunny and some of the humour is just typical. But, you can't resist Elizabeth Hurley in some very revealing clothes. She is excellent as The Devil, it's official that she has never been this good since Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery in 1997. Brendan Fraser is almost as good as her, it's easy to say he has lots of comedic talent, he does a great job of playing six different characters, each get caught in horridly embarrassing situations. There are also some very clever scenes to boost the film, including one of the scenes where Elliot awakes from his wish, and Hurley's shaded character is `teaching' a class, and there is a greatly funny act in which Elliot wishes to be the most sensitive man in the world...Bedazzled is a surprisingly above-average picture, far from perfect, but way away from bad, and it is to be as genuinely enjoyed as the first film.",4,Surprisingly entertaining and genuinely funny,985651200,"03 27, 2001",2001,2122,"['BedazzledScore', '71/100Bedazzled', 'further', 'proof', 'fairly', 'tales', 'need', 'not', 'come', 'name', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'film', 'adult', 'version', '7', 'wishes', 'soul', 'catcher', 'remake', 'old', '1967', 'favourite', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'plausible', 'original', 'still', 'darned', 'good', 'stuff', 'highly', 'recommendable', 'piece', 'comedic', 'viewing.Elliot', 'Richards', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'socially', 'incompetent', 'technical', 'advisor', 'working', 'call-center', 'had', 'crush', 'Alison', 'Gardner', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'nearly', 'four', 'years', 'One', 'evening', 'already', 'started', 'particularly', 'bad', 'Elliot', 'Elliot', 'be', 'life', 'heart', 'heard', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'young', 'lady', 'Elliot', 'introducing', 'Devil', 'Lucifer', 'Princess', 'Darkness', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'deal', 'Seven', 'wishes', 'Soul', 'Quickly', 'Elliot', 'convinced', 'accepts', 'wish', 'fulfilled', 'massive', 'disadvantages', 'as', 'well', 'soon', 'Elliot', 'get', 'contract', 'only', 'thing', 'matters', 'now', 'being', 'able', 'take', 'chances', 'himself.Indeed', 'Bedazzled', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'end', 'jokes', 'are', 'sometimes', 'largely', 'unfunny', 'humour', 'just', 'typical', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'very', 'revealing', 'clothes', 'excellent', 'Devil', 'official', 'never', 'been', 'good', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'International', 'Man', 'Mystery', '1997', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'easy', 'say', 'lots', 'comedic', 'talent', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'six', 'different', 'characters', 'get', 'caught', 'horridly', 'embarrassing', 'situations', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'clever', 'scenes', 'boost', 'film', 'including', 'one', 'scenes', 'where', 'Elliot', 'wish', 'Hurley', 'shaded', 'character', 'teaching', 'class', 'greatly', 'funny', 'act', 'Elliot', 'be', 'most', 'sensitive', 'man', 'world', 'Bedazzled', 'surprisingly', 'above-average', 'picture', 'far', 'perfect', 'way', 'away', 'bad', 'be', 'genuinely', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'film']",Bedazzled

The remake of ""Bedazzled"" doesn't spend lots of time pondering theological questions about good vs. evil.  The film just gets right to the point:  Sell your soul to the devil, and bad things will happen.  Fortunately, those bad things are quite funny!Brendan Fraser plays a computer geek alternately mocked and avoided by his co-workers.  He's in love with Alison (Frances O'Connor), another employee at his company who doesn't really remember that he exists although he can name the date and minute of their only conversation.  When a romantically frustrated Elliott comments that he would sell his soul to the Devil to be with Alison, in pops Elizabeth Hurley to ink the phonebook-sized contract on that Faustian bargain.In exchange for his soul, Elliot receives seven wishes and a pager-like device (""just type in 666"") to get out of any bad situations that arise.  Elliot then sets about wishing to be the type of man that he thinks Alison will want.  Of course, do men EVER really understand what women want?As the Devil grants him his wishes, things go hilariously wrong.  After wishing to be rich and powerful and married to Alison, Elliot wakes up as a Colombian drug lord.  Later, he wishes to be sensitive and can't stop weeping over the sunset.  Even though you know before Elliot what's caused his wish to go wrong, watching him figure out is terribly funny.Fraser plays Elliot with delightful confusion.  He responds to one of his Spanish-speaking cohorts in the drug lord sequence by explaining that he can't speak Spanish--but realizes that he's explained his lack of Spanish-speaking ability IN SPANISH.  (We see the English subtitles.)  Fraser's physical transformations add to the comedy--he goes from being a sweating 7-foot tall dumb-as-a-rock basketball star in one segment to an American icon (saving the surprise) in another.Hurley makes a wonderfully naughty devil.  You can almost believe her when she explains that souls are overrated, useless things, rather like one's appendix--something Elliot won't miss at all.  Her numerous blink-of-an-eye costume changes--all variations on a sexy red and black motify--make her fun to watch.

527948,A2KTT44JND0AZI,B00003CXKJ,Laurie,"[2, 3]","Brendan Fraser has taken some nasty hits recently. There are hair rumors, weight dissings, the whole Golden Globes clap n' point thing, and now ""Furry Vengeance,"" which, God help, has his name on it as star and executive producer. By all public appearances though, he's taken it all with grace. Yeah, he says, I added some pounds. I was at the Golden Globes and spazzed. Sure, my crotch gets attacked over and over in ""Furry Vengeance"" but it makes my kids laugh. The man seems to be an affable, self-effacing goofball who knows exactly who and what he is. In this regard, as far as movie actors go, he seems to stand alone.Men want to despise men who women openly idolize. They get as snide as 14-year-old girls when they fall short in comparison. In their own testosterone pumped cattiness it seems they've been lying in wait for the nice-guy, lust-worthy ape-man to turn 40 and lose his ab definition so they can pounce.  What they underestimate is Brendan Fraser's fan base. His fans don't require a rippled stomach to continue their support. For most of them, it isn't about that.There are hordes of dedicated Fraser fans who bristle more at the current attacks than Fraser seems to himself. For some, it started with George from ""George of the Jungle,"" embraceable not just for the lithe muscles, but for the charming innocence. Others were wooed by the Mummy's Rick O'Connell, an action hero with brilliant blue eyes, even bluer against the desert, who lets a smart woman take the lead with the full understanding that his strength is protecting her, not competing with her.  Perhaps it was ""baby-man"" Adam Weber from ""Blast from the Past,"" at age 35 discovering the world for the first time in late-1990's LA, where his good manners and well-rounded education were perceived as freakish. There may be some late bloomers who waited until they saw Uncle Trevor in 3D before they fell in line. (note:  if you need to be convinced of Brendan Fraser as egoless kook, listen to his commentary on the ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" DVD.  He lovingly calls out the movie's cheesiest moments, and as executive producer, he's well within his rights to do so, channels Mike Meyers, taunts himself and his little paunch, and even points out his own man-boobs. Which in turn begs the question, what other actor would be comfortable enough with himself to direct attention to his man-boobs? In 3D, no less?)However, I may be the only fan newly recruited to the Brendan-cult by uber-nerd Elliot Richards. Everything I needed to gain respect for Brendan Fraser as an actor I found in ""Bedazzled.""At the core of me, I was sure I would never waste my time on this movie. The poster/DVD cover with its red background and the sleazy picture of Fraser with Elizabeth Hurley, snake and flames repulsed me.  How many soul bartering devil movies does the world really need? We get it already. Don't negotiate with the devil. Hell, just avoid any conversation with the devil period. More importantly, don't bother with any movie that makes you cringe even before you see it. Yes, ""Inkheart,"" books are judged by their covers. That's why millions are spent marketing movies. In the case of ""Bedazzled,"" that money was a poor investment.To summarize quickly--Elliot Richards is a socially inept dweeb who has a crush on an unattainable woman, making him the perfect patsy for a devil deal. He gets seven wishes before he hands his soul over, which means Elliot gets several makeovers as he wishes in multiple failed ways to be the man he is not.Released a decade ago, ""Bedazzled"" wasn't particularly loved by the critics but it wasn't wholly panned, either. Despite the current perception, the reviews still available on the internet range from lukewarm to great. The New York Times describes the movie's setup then offers this: ""What follows is outrageous fun. Elliot, wishing himself rich, powerful and married to Alison, is transformed into a Colombian drug lord. Mr. Fraser is a master of goofy befuddlement, and his face as he discovers himself speaking Spanish is almost worth the price of the ticket."" Good or bad review, Fraser's performance was roundly praised.  The Times goes on to say, ""The physical transformations that Mr. Fraser undergoes in each scenario are impressive, but the real artistry is in his quick-change performance. He looks perpetually surprised at himself as he utters dumb- jock clich&eacute;s, sings a song in praise of our friend the dolphin (complete with dolphin voices) and delivers nonsensical witticisms at a high-toned literary soir&eacute;e. With his slightly pudgy face and his loose, ungainly physical presence, he manages to be both likable and ridiculous."" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times didn't like the movie but still writes:  ""Fraser is a wonderful comic actor--better than he gets the credit for, because he creates funny characters instead of exploding in what is intended as funny behavior.""What finally convinced me to see ""Bedazzled"" was Harold Ramis. Director and co-writer Harold Ramis' involvement was unknown to me until a couple of months ago and for me gave the movie comic street-cred.  If you don't know him, but his name sounds familiar it's because Harold Ramis directed or co-wrote cult-followed classic comedies starting in the days of SCTV and early SNL that became their own subgenre--movies like ""Animal House,"" ""Caddyshack,"" ""National Lampoon's Vacation,"" ""Ghostbusters,"" and a personal favorite of mine, ""Groundhog Day."" For me that trumped Hurley, boa constrictor, and rewarmed concept. And I hate to say it, but Fraser.Here's what happened. I rented the movie and watched it through stunned.  When it was over, I immediately went back and watched the first 10 minutes three or four times in a row. I knew Elliot Richards! There was an Elliot Richards sitting a few cubicles over from me at my office. I had avoided and insulted multiple Elliots through the years. That was me at the bar table, wincing as an uninvited Elliot approaches, realizing the chair next me is the only one available and that I'm trapped. When I've made inappropriate jokes that have fallen with a thud to the floor I've worried that I was an Elliot Richards.  I did not expect Fraser to play such an unflattering character. I did not expect his performance, from the broad strokes to the nuances, to be perfect.As the devil twists his dreams into nightmares, Elliot is transformed physically to match each wishful scenario. For a good chunk of the movie, Fraser Is unrecognizable. He is prostheticed, wigged, freckled, and for one alter-Elliot, 3G enhanced.  The transformation I found most amazing was the most subtle. He wishes to be very handsome, sophisticated and intellectual. When he enters the scene, he looks different but I couldn't figure out how. His hair is parted on the side and coiffured back, but that wasn't it. This Elliot, as opposed to real Elliot, is dressed immaculately in an expensive suit, and has perfect posture, but that still didn't explain why Fraser didn't look like himself.  I inched through the frames, frustrated that I couldn't tell what was just off enough to not to be quite right. Then I realized it was his nose. They had altered his nose in the slightest way, making it more sloped and pointed.  Now it's one thing to say to a movie star, hey, for comedy's sake, we're gonna ginger you up with red hair, gooey freckled complexion and give you little teeth.  It's another thing entirely to say to a movie star, hey, to make you really handsome we have to change your face. The result is a hyper-handsomeness, bordering on caricature, which was exactly what was needed for comic effect.  But can you imagine broaching the subject with any leading man?  Wouldn't it result in a screaming diva debacle?What I realized is that when Brendan Fraser commits to a movie, he commits whole-heartedly and with enthusiasm for the process. He appears to be willing to let go and do his part, trusting that the director, producers and creative team will do theirs. As film actors become more celebrated they also seem to become more controlling, and there isn't the sense that Fraser needs to do that. Good movie, bad movie, there is no slacking. He's obviously willing to do anything on behalf of the project no matter how it makes him look. Some may see his resume and wonder if he shouldn't have pushed back more often. If you're a director, though, he should top the list of actors who would be dreamboats to work with, seeing that Fraser lets his image take backseat to the director's vision. When a movie doesn't work, it's hard to blame him. He's doing everything he can, and when the material and director are good, Fraser's talent is in full evidence. Now, if he could just be a bit more selective about scripts and directors, he would find the respect for his acting that he's only had sporadically through the years.I see all these qualities illustrated in ""Bedazzled."" He's fearless. When asked to sing like a dolphin, he does. It's ridiculous. It's also really funny. He doesn't hesitate to play Elliot full-dork, and, as mentioned earlier, he's perfect. The face, the posture, the voice, the laugh, the line delivery, the smile, he captures awkward and unattractive jerk with the same gusto that he did handsome matinee hero. The critics tend to like him in more serious roles, but he's a natural comedian and he's given the chance to prove it more so here than in his other comedies. He gets to be really good in what I find to be a surprisingly good movie and those things don't align for him as often as they should.Having pleaded my case, I ask you to go back and see ""Bedazzled"" again, or if you haven't seen it, find it. In my opinion, it's Brendan Fraser at his best. Maybe you'll take away from it what I did--that Brendan Fraser is a likable, under-appreciated, talented actor. Appreciate that he always gives it his all, even in something as unworthy as ""Furry Vengeance"" and is managing to keep his sense of humor and humility despite the recent public malice. Give him a break, send him some love, and wish for a good script to come his way.  He's paid his dues.",5,"In defense of Brendan Fraser:  A fresh look at ""Bedazzled""",1273622400,"05 12, 2010",2010,10155,"['Brendan', 'Fraser', 'taken', 'nasty', 'hits', 'recently', 'are', 'hair',

This modern tale of it isn't that bad and is actually pretty good thanks to smart writing, a great director, and good casting.Elliot Richards(Fraser) is the love desperate nerd that everybody hates. He is to nice and gets annoyinig from the simple fact that he trys to hard. He has the hots for a woman at work Allison(O'Connor) who barely even knows he's there. He wants her desperately so he says to God he'd do almost anything for her. The next thing you know The Devil(Hurley) is there offering Elliot a chance to get Allison.The deal is simple. Elliot will get the Devil his soul in exchange for seven wishes. Elliot is reluctant at first to the proposition but after some clever temptations by the devil he buckles in and says yes to her. The next thing you know he is making wishes and the devil is fulfilling them with some nasty and quite devilish tricks. Now Elliot must decide if this is really the path he wants to take and if these wishes are all that they are cracked up to be.Brendan Fraser is good in this movie. This guys movies are usually hit or miss and this one is a hit. I don't like it as much as say the Mummy series or Blast from the Past, but this is a good movie. Fraser is fantastic when he acts out the wishes. He's so funny when he's the Colombian drug lord speaking his Spanish. He's great in the movie and you can tell he really had some fun making this movie.Elizabeth Hurley is breath taking in the film. This is one of the most gorgeous and flawless woman in the world and in ways she carries this movie. She is very tempting and I like how they casted her as the devil instead of some sweet talking con artist man. She's so hot in the film and she's just awesome. If you like Elizabeth Hurley you have to go and watch this film.Harold Ramis has given himself another good film. This guy is a clever writer and it shows in the film. The movie was also clever in the way that he includes all of Elliots co-wokers from the beginning of the film in the wishes. He's a smart director and really is underrated in the business.

527957,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXKJ,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","It seems like there have been an exceptionally high number of remakes in the past two or three years. People who read this column know by now that I am no fan of this practice. I feel that there are a sufficient number of new tales to tell. The logic of going back and retelling one escapes me, especially in these days of video and DVD, in which virtual every movie that has been made is available somewhere in these formats. What isn't available to buy or rent inevitably comes up on cable television, from which you can videotape the film yourself. For a critic, remakes present a dilemma because one has an obligation to compare it to the original, despite the fact that many readers may have little use for such information. This new version of Bedazzled does have some things going for it that most remakes don't. The original, made in 1967, is a cult favorite that, for some odd reason, has been more forgotten by time than some other great movies. Instead of copying the older story, today's version is content to use merely the plot's framework. The result is a mixed blessing. It is not nearly as clever, funny or, for that matter, as naughty as its predecessor, but when compared to most recent comedies, it stands head and shoulders above them.Brendan Fraser plays Elliot Richards, one of those polite but nerdy types people go out of their way to avoid. While out drinking with some fellow workers, who wish he'd disappear, he talks to a girl named Alison [Francis O'Connor] and falls head over heads in love. It's hopeless, of course. Later he meets a ravishingly beautiful woman [Elizabeth Hurley] who casually announces that she is The Devil. And, indeed, she is. She urges poor Elliot to fix his miserable, lonely life by selling his soul in exchange for seven wishes. Elliot's a bright fellow, but, despairing of his situation, he reluctantly signs a contract. What follows is a series of vignettes based on the results of these wishes. The movie takes the phase 'be careful what you wish for' and makes the comic most of it.Harold Ramis was a good choice to direct Bedazzled. He has made some good screwball comedies, including Groundhog Day and Caddyshack. He also wrote the screenplay for Ghostbusters. His style is appropriate for this rendition, just as the sophisticated Stanley Donen was the perfect director for the more adult original.Fraser is an under appreciated actor. In each portion of Bedazzled, he transforms physically to become the person he has wished to be. He doesn't simply mug his way through. He obviously puts a lot of thought into how to play each character. Elizabeth Hurly plays The Devil as a witty, urbane woman who has an unabashed zeal for her work. This may not be the embodiment of Satan we are used to seeing, but at least in this case we can easily see how she got herself kicked out of Heaven. The original starred Dudley Moore as Elliot and Peter Cook as The Devil. As a comedy team, they were far superior, but their types are hard to find these days. While I am giving this new version a fairly good recommendation, if the original ever comes your way, be sure and check it out.",3,"Rather amusing, but no match for the 1967 original",1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,3137,"['have', 'been', 'exceptionally', 'high', 'number', 'remakes', 'past', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'People', 'who', 'read', 'column', 'know', 'now', 'am', 'fan', 'practice', 'feel', 'are', 'sufficient', 'number', 'new', 'tales', 'tell', 'logic', 'going', 'back', 'retelling', 'one', 'especially', 'days', 'video', 'DVD', 'virtual', 'movie', 'been', 'made', 'available', 'somewhere', 'formats', 'What', ""n't"", 'available', 'buy', 'rent', 'inevitably', 'up', 'cable', 'television', 'can', 'videotape', 'film', 'critic', 'remakes', 'present', 'dilemma', 'one', 'obligation', 'compare', 'original', 'fact', 'many', 'readers', 'may', 'have', 'little', 'use', 'such', 'information', 'new', 'version', 'Bedazzled', 'have', 'things', 'going', 'most', 'remakes', 'do', ""n't"", 'original', 'made', '1967', 'cult', 'favorite', 'odd', 'reason', 'been', 'more', 'forgotten', 'time', 'other', 'great', 'movies', 'Instead', 'copying', 'older', 'story', 'today', 'version', 'content', 'use', 'merely', 'plot', 'framework', 'result', 'mixed', 'blessing', 'not', 'nearly', 'clever', 'funny', 'matter', 'as', 'naughty', 'predecessor', 'when', 'compared', 'most', 'recent', 'comedies', 'head', 'shoulders', 'them.Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Elliot', 'Richards', 'one', 'polite', 'nerdy', 'types', 'people', 'go', 'way', 'avoid', 'out', 'drinking', 'fellow', 'workers', 'who', 'wish', ""'d"", 'disappear', 'girl', 'named', 'Alison', '[', 'Francis', ""O'Connor"", ']', 'head', 'heads', 'love', 'hopeless', 'course', 'Later', 'ravishingly', 'beautiful', 'woman', '[', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', ']', 'who', 'casually', 'Devil', 'indeed', 'poor', 'Elliot', 'fix', 'miserable', 'lonely', 'life', 'selling', 'soul', 'exchange', 'seven', 'wishes', 'Elliot', 'bright', 'fellow', 'despairing', 'situation', 'reluctantly', 'signs', 'contract', 'What', 'series', 'vignettes', 'based', 'results', 'wishes', 'movie', 'phase', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'comic', 'most', 'it.Harold', 'Ramis', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'direct', 'Bedazzled', 'made', 'good', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'including', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Caddyshack', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Ghostbusters', 'style', 'appropriate', 'rendition', 'just', 'sophisticated', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'was', 'perfect', 'director', 'more', 'adult', 'original.Fraser', 'appreciated', 'actor', 'portion', 'Bedazzled', 'physically', 'become', 'person', 'wished', 'be', ""n't"", 'simply', 'mug', 'way', 'obviously', 'lot', 'thought', 'how', 'play', 'character', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurly', 'Devil', 'witty', 'urbane', 'woman', 'who', 'unabashed', 'zeal', 'work', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'embodiment', 'Satan', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'least', 'case', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'how', 'got', 'kicked', 'Heaven', 'original', 'starred', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'Elliot', 'Peter', 'Cook', 'Devil', 'comedy', 'team', 'were', 'far', 'superior', 'types', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'days', 'am', 'giving', 'new', 'version', 'fairly', 'good', 'recommendation', 'original', 'ever', 'way', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'out']",Bedazzled

Dweebish Elliot, marvelously played by Brendan Fraser, trades his soul to the Devil for seven wishes.  The twist here is that each wish lands Elliot in a whole different world - Columian drug lord, NBA star, etc.  In each scenario Fraser basically creates a whole new character, and principal members of the supporting cast also appear in revamped personas.  Not only is it an impressive show of the actors' versitility, but it makes for a very funny movie.  As funny as all the different wish lives are, the best parts of the movie are the connecting scenes where Elliot and the Devil plan the next wish.  Elizabeth Hurley has a wonderful time as the Devil, and this is the perfect vehicle for her wicked sense of humor.

He Americanized the fantasy vignettes in the film, by making them more physical, cruder, and more obvious.  But, what he couldn't replicate was the chemistry of Moore and Cook, who worked together as beautifully as Laurel and Hardy.Brendan Fraser, often buried under a lot of make-up, helps to make this new version watchable.  He's very animated and funny.  The script is sometimes clever, but doesn't approach the razor shape wit displayed in the first film.  The musical score is unimaginative, contrasted with the delightful pop pastiches that Dudley Moore created the first time around.Elizabeth Hurley is here as eye candy, a commodity that Raquel Welch displayed to an even greater degree in the original.Watch this movie if you want a few laughs.

It is a work of comic and cinematic genius. I encourage shoppers to consider it carefully before committing to this dumbed down 2000 version.The DVD offered on this page contains a radical dumbing down of a great film. The great film is ""Bedazzled"" of 1967 by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.  It is a multi-layered delight as well as a deeply insightful variation on one of the most famous legends in Western Civilization:  the man who sells his soul to the devil for (choose any or all of the following) sex, pleasure, riches, power, or to know all things as God knows them.  Cook and Moore, by both word and action, refer back to Marlowe's ""Dr. Faustus,"" to Goethe's ""Faust,"" and even to Hannah Arendt's theory of the ""banality"" of evil with reference to the Holocaust, and they do it with the wacky finesse one associates with Monty Python.  Philosophy, theology, the slapstick of vaudeville, the Irish-accented intellectualism of James Joyce, upper-class Oxbridge-snobbery, the trench-coated detective of the English mystery novel, your grandmother being bilked by traveling salesmen, Raquel Welch playing the Deadly Sin of Lust as if she were Scarlet O'Hara from ""Gone with the Wind,"" puns high and low, and loud, wet ""thhhpts"" of raspberries thhhpt'd in hopeful despair - the 1967 film lacks nothing of humor and insight into the foolish and dangerous desires and yet loving and redeeming intentions of humankind.  Now, the 2000 version -  well, dudes, it's a masterpiece of simple-minded dialogue and cheap sexual imagery.Obviously, I recommend clicking back to the main page for ""Bedazzled"" and ordering the 2007 release of the 1967 original.

Schneider,"[5, 5]","BEDAZZLED is an enjoyable movie experience, thanks to the smart writing and the terrific performances of Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley. The story is not new but this film has smart, funny dialogue (even poignant near the end). Hurley clearly relishes in her black-comedic role as ""The Devil"", while Fraser plays 7 different characters, and is very funny in all of them.Brendan Fraser plays a nebbish named Elliot who annoys everyone he works with as he lacks any real social skill and always tries too hard to be everyone's friend (which makes me wonder how he ever got through both high school and college, but never mind such questions while you're watching this). He has a major crush on this girl Alison, who barely evens notices him.  When he proclaims ""I'd give my soul for her!"", of course good ol' Beelzebub appears to him in the form of--Elizabeth Hurley. At first Elliot doesn't believe that this gorgeous woman in the red dress is the devil (which leads to a funny scene where she hands him her card which just simply says ""The Devil""--which is an obvious tip of the hat to the 1977 George Burns-John Denver film ""Oh, God!"", where Burns hands Denver a card on which is simply printed ""God"").When Hurley finally does convince Elliot, and Elliot reluctantly agrees to the Faustian bargain (on the premise that Alison will be all his), that's when the fun really begins.

528006,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXKJ,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 21]","In the inaptly named ""Bedazzled"" - a virtually laughless remake of a 1967 Peter Cook/Dudley Moore comedy - the old Faust legend takes one of its severest beatings ever.  I've seen the original film only once before - at a revival theatre in the mid `70's - and remember finding it to be a fresh, original and occasionally laugh-out-loud hilarious British comedy.  Unfortunately, none of those adjectives can be applied to this newest version, which strands Brandan Fraser and the stunning Elizabeth Hurley in 90-minutes worth of repetitious humorless nonsense.Strike one against this film is that it is basically a one-joke concept stretched out to be a full length feature film - sort of like a 90-minute version of a mediocre ""Bewitched"" episode.  Hopelessly nerdy Elliot (Fraser) - who is such an overbearing geek that his coworkers are forced to run and hide when he comes in their vicinity - makes an idle wish one day to be with the beautiful young woman he loves and yearns for from afar.  Enter Hurley as the devil who takes Elliot in hand, promising him that he will be granted seven wishes on the understanding that his soul will be required as final payment.  What Elliot doesn't understand is that making a bargain with the ""Father of Lies"" - even if in the guise of a beautiful woman - virtually guarantees that each wish will, in some way, fall far short of securing him total happiness.Since the 1967 original managed to make a genuinely funny comedy out of the very same material, we must assume that the failure of this version lies not in the premise but in the execution.  So where did this particular group of filmmakers go wrong?  Part of the problem may lie in the fact that Brandan Fraser, though a likable enough actor on the surface, is hardly a gifted subtle comedian on the level of Dudley Moore.  Elizabeth Hurley, easily one of the most stunningly gorgeous actresses working in films today, looks sensational in the part of the temptress and she does convey a certain sly sexiness that might have worked if the jokes had simply been funnier.  Here too is part of the problem - the weakness of the script.  The scrapes Elliot inadvertently wishes himself into are simply not very imaginative or humorous.  One of the funniest sequences I have ever seen in a film actually occurs in the original ""Bedazzled,"" when Moore finds himself stranded in a convent filled with nuns bouncing on trampolines.  This film could have used a few bouncing nuns I think.  Instead, Elliot's adventures come across as hopelessly mundane in their nature and, even worse, the caricatures he is called upon to act out in many of the scenes border nearly on the grotesque.  Perhaps, Jim Carey might have been able to pull this part off.  Fraser just seems stranded way over his head during much of the film.You know you're in trouble when, as a viewer, you begin to count off how many wishes the main character has already used up.  If it weren't for the eye-candy provided by Ms. Hurley, ""Bedazzled"" would truly be hell on Earth.  As it is, it seems more like purgatory.  Now if only we could figure out which sins we are being forced to atone for.  If I knew, I promise I would stop committing them immediately.",2,Bedraggled,994550400,"07 8, 2001",2001,3217,"['inaptly', 'named', 'Bedazzled', 'virtually', 'laughless', 'remake', '1967', 'Peter', 'Cook/Dudley', 'Moore', 'comedy', 'old', 'Faust', 'legend', 'one', 'severest', 'beatings', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'film', 'only', 'once', 'revival', 'theatre', 'mid', '70', 'remember', 'finding', 'be', 'fresh', 'original', 'occasionally', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hilarious', 'British', 'comedy', 'Unfortunately', 'none', 'adjectives', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'newest', 'version', 'Brandan', 'Fraser', 'stunning', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', '90-minutes', 'worth', 'repetitious', 'humorless', 'one', 'film', 'basically', 'one-joke', 'concept', 'stretched', 'out', 'be', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'sort', '90-minute', 'version', 'mediocre', 'Bewitched', 'episode', 'Hopelessly', 'nerdy', 'Elliot', 'Fraser', 'who', 'overbearing', 'geek', 'coworkers', 'are', 'forced', 'run', 'hide', 'when', 'vicinity', 'idle', 'wish', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'yearns', 'afar', 'Enter', 'Hurley', 'devil', 'who', 'Elliot', 'hand', 'promising', 'will', 'be', 'granted', 'seven', 'wishes', 'understanding', 'soul', 'will', 'be', 'required', 'final', 'payment', 'What', 'Elliot', ""n't"", 'understand', 'making', 'bargain', 'Father', 'Lies', 'even', 'guise', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'virtually', 'wish', 'will', 'way', 'fall', 'far', 'short', 'securing', 'total', 'happiness.Since', '1967', 'original', 'managed', 'make', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'comedy', 'very', 'same', 'material', 'must', 'assume', 'failure', 'version', 'not', 'premise', 'execution', 'where', 'did', 'particular', 'group', 'filmmakers', 'go', 'wrong', 'Part', 'problem', 'may', 'lie', 'fact', 'Brandan', 'Fraser', 'likable', 'enough', 'actor', 'surface', 'hardly', 'gifted', 'subtle', 'comedian', 'level', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'stunningly', 'gorgeous', 'actresses', 'working', 'films', 'today', 'sensational', 'part', 'temptress', 'convey', 'certain', 'sly', 'sexiness', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'jokes', 'had', 'simply', 'been', 'funnier', 'Here', 'too', 'part', 'problem', 'weakness', 'script', 'scrapes', 'Elliot', 'inadvertently', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'very', 'imaginative', 'humorous', 'One', 'funniest', 'sequences', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'actually', 'original', 'Bedazzled', 'when', 'Moore', 'stranded', 'convent', 'filled', 'nuns', 'bouncing', 'trampolines', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'few', 'bouncing', 'nuns', 'think', 'Instead', 'Elliot', 'adventures', 'come', 'hopelessly', 'mundane', 'nature', 'even', 'worse', 'caricatures', 'called', 'act', 'out', 'many', 'scenes', 'border', 'nearly', 'grotesque', 'Perhaps', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'pull', 'part', 'off', 'Fraser', 'just', 'stranded', 'way', 'head', 'much', 'film.You', 'know', ""'re"", 'trouble', 'when', 'viewer', 'begin', 'count', 'off', 'how', 'many', 'main', 'character', 'already', 'used', 'up', 'were', ""n't"", 'eye-candy', 'provided', 'Ms.', 'Hurley', 'Bedazzled', 'would', 'truly', 'be', 'hell', 'Earth', 'more', 'purgatory', 'Now', 'only', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'are', 'being', 'forced', 'atone', 'knew', 'promise', 'would', 'stop', 'committing', 'immediately']",Bedazzled

One day as the female coworker of his dreams passes by, Elliot mutters those fateful words ""I'd give my soul..."" and up pops a gorgeous version of the devil with a contract for seven wishes. She talks Elliot into signing and that's when all the fun begins.My Opinion: I didn't know quite what to expect going into Bedazzled. I was pleasantly surprised once the seven wishes started. Each one puts Brendan in a completely different and twisted situation. He shines in each one. Hurley is devilishly hot as a not so evil devil. She lights up every scene she is in. Gabriel Casseus make a guest appearance and is excellent. The story was well done. Each of the wishes had a point and they were entertaining and fun. The tone of the movie is lighthearted. Elliot is taught a lesson and we get to learn along with him. The removed Rock Star scene, which is included on the DVD, shows a much darker turn that the movie could have taken. I was glad it was removed.  In the end I was entertained and enjoyed the movie. I liked the message that we all make our own choices. You are free to make yours, but I'd recommend you check out Bedazzled.DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen anamorphic - 2.35:1  Sound: DD5.1  Extras: Commentaries, Making of featurette, Deleted Rock Star Scene and others Menus: Cool Good Menus let you make your own wishesWhat You Should Do:  Check this movie out.

I can't call this a remake because Ramis' casual looking version looks and feels like a different movie than its formal English counterpart. Having seen both this film and the 1967 original, I like the American version a little better.Elliott is a nerdy guy in a dead-end job desperate to be liked by his co-workers. There's a girl at his office he's had his eye on but she doesn't notice him. Meeting the devil at a local bar, He makes a deal to sell his soul in exchange for seven wishes in the hopes of winning the girl of his dreams. Too bad he doesn't read the fine print on the contract he signs. There's ALWAYS a catch when dealing with the Devil. First he wishes he were rich and powerful- Only he's a Columbian druglord about to be betrayed by his woman and his cartel. Moments before his death He pages 666. He wishes he were sensitive, and when he cries at the sunset she dumps him. He wishes he were a basketball superstar Only to find out his ""package"" is small! He then wishes he were an intellectual writer with a big package-only to find out he's gay! He wishes he were president of the United States only to find he's Abe Lincoln on the night he's about to he shot by John Wilkes Booth! Six wishes later the Devil is tired of toying with him and insists he makes a final wish. He wishes for the girl of his dreams to be happy and the contract is voided. In the end he doesn't get the girl, but learns a lesson: Be yourself.What makes Ramis' version a superior film is the solid storytelling and excellent direction. The script in this version is a lot tighter than in the clunky 1967 original and the characters are better developed and have more complex personalities. Because the writing is more concise, it makes the story easier to follow. The Original Bedazzled was a slow, tedious movie that focused so much on minor technicalities it was hard to watch. This version grabs the viewer and keeps them watching until the end.The acting here is top notch. Brendan Fraser gives one of his best performances as the Nebbish nerdy Elliott. His comic timing and execution throughout the film remind me a lot of the late John Ritter, he really knows how to use his face and eyes to get a laugh. Elizabeth Hurley gives a great performance as the Devil; It's just a delight to watch her onscreen. She has excellent chemistry with Fraser and their comic timing is spot on. Hurley's charm and personality carries the movie through all three acts, even though she's the devil you just like her. Throughout the changes into all those stylish outfits you see her, not the clothes she wears. (J.Lo and Halle take note) That's the mark of a good actress. Frances O'Connor does gives a solid performance as the object of Elliott's desire. She holds her own in all the sketches and has great chemistry with Fraser. Comedy veterans Orlando Jones and Toby Huss add strong comedic support in all the comedy sketches.Director Harold Ramis creates a tightly focused comedy with excellent production values and great cinematography. I felt like I was right there on those California streets in every frame. The visual effects blend with the live action and all we see are the hilarious jokes.The Harold Ramis version of Bedazzled is definitely worth the purchase price.

528016,AGRR05FH945HR,B00003CXKJ,Steven Cain,"[2, 3]","If the makers of this movie seriously thought that Liz Hurley's off-the-scale sexuality could carry an entire movie, they were right.However, given the quality of the cast, led by the always superb Brendan Fraser, with the gorgeous, classy  Frances O'Connor as a perfectly cast love interest, and the masterful direction of Harold Ramis, the movie carries itself.This is an inspired re-make of the amazing original Pete and Dud movie, which featured sixties/seventies goddess (she still is) Racquel Welch. Having a divine creature like Elizabeth Hurley playing the Devil, especially utilizing a fantasy temptress wardrobe to die for, was a stroke of genius. Liz as a schoolmarm, a nurse, a cheerleader... I can't go on...The extra features are excellent from the Commentaries (including Liz H.) to the absolutely invaluable Making Of feature, hosted by La Hurley, which suggests that her considerable sex appeal - a huge part of which is her wicked sense of humor - is just a natural function of who she is, rather than something she has to work at projecting, like Britney Spears.A message to the movie? Yes, pretty much the same as in the original - that happiness cannot come from external trappings. That you have to find your Truth within you, and if you can learn to love yourself, you will automatically be more loveable and more interesting to others, without having to seduce them with money and power.

He is heavily attracted to a coworker, but does not offer her anything that she is looking for. In comes the Devil, played by the worst of the worst, Elizabeth Hurley. She offers Elliot 7 wishes.

Friends loathe interaction with him, women find him lacking, and life seems to frown on him whenever it decides to shine elsewhere, opting to instead rain on that poor tech's parade. Luckily for him, the stunningly clad devil decides that his soul has some worth and that he, for some reason, won't go to hell without her help. So, he is given seven wishes for that miserable burden he carries around somewhere inside of him, and then the nightmare proceeds.While I'd like to commit an armada of words to sinking this ship and making myself feel a little better after seeing what I saw, I find that I can't bear to entertain those thoughts. For some reason, the notion of wasting even more time with this movie, building a basis around it to explain all of its faults, seems like a nightmare. So, I'll instead pick at the scabs left from remembering just a little, showcasing my main problems within the image that it gave the viewer. Hopefully, that will caution you.First, Elliot has a little problem and, through experience, he somehow changes over the movie's vast 90 minutes, and that's supposedly buyable. He becomes confident in some rights, not as annoying toward the end of the movie, and that would have been something acceptable but, for some reason, the end of the movie reverts him yet again. It makes him the same him from the beginning, not allowing a mold to be struck. And that would have been great and all, but, in some scenes - you see the problem.Secondly, the devil is way too soft and gets played in the end. We all know its going to happen, that the end in a movie like this is going to be loathesomely happy, but the way that comes about is supposed to be interesting. In this movie, however, it doesn't find that place and instead relies on faults within the evil in evil - of all things, allowing Elliot pity in some rights. A little Catch 22 here, the escape for the soul there, and boom - its over. Yeah, whatever.Third, the wish sequences weren't all that funny. They were touted as being great, keeping one &quot;in stitches,&quot; but sitting there was more like bondage to me. I kept wondering how stupid someone could be, not learning by the second try that Evil might somehow play tricks with the wording, but apparently that doesn't dawn on the wisher. No, with your soul on the line, its trust for the devil that you decide to court. Nevermind the fact that he didn't trust the devil in the beginning. Lay a chip on the table and trust the house when it comes down to playing for stakes. Yeah.And, lastly, there was the ending's true ending. While I can understand many things that happen, the happiness in that garbage, giving him something he truly wanted, is sickening. While I can't say anything on it, really, I can say that I hoped for the process of breaking, of maiming something, and I seem to have gotten it. Unfortunately, the suffering was done by me and Elliot walked away unscathed.If you like movies of this sort, knowing the end at the beginning and think that situations like the ones described are funny, then play here. Be warned, however, that it might have an aftereffect and that you might be driven, in your madness, to try and sell your soul to make it all go away. Still, when dealing with devils like this one, there are worse things than losing your soul. Yes, try the retention of a memory.",2,Seven Wishes?

Haley,"[0, 2]","I may be a bit biased in this review, in that I absolutely love Brendan Fraser and, with the exception of ""George of the Jungle"" and ""Dudley Do-Right,"" have adored every movie he's been in. But even so, I'm writing this review.I'll admit I have not seen the original version of ""Bedazzled"" that this movie was based on, so I don't have anything to compare this to. ""Bedazzled"" is NOT the best film ever; it's not going to win any Oscars and there sure isn't a guy on a ship shouting ""I'm the King of the World!"" But it's a cute movie and it'll make you laugh at *least* once. I know I couldn't stop laughing through the whole thing.What impressed me most about ""Bedazzled"" was the make-up. Brendan Fraser gets to play 6 different characters and he looks like a different person when doing each one. He goes from looking remarkably like Oded Fehrer (his co-star in ""The Mummy) while playing a Colombian drug lord, to being a blonde, seven-foot-tall basketball player (who is a little short on brains and a little small in the ummm... private area).Besides the great make-up, it's also a cute little story with only a few cliches, and I enjoyed the ending just because the lead character did not end up with the woman he wanted - he ended up with someone better.The other actors in this movie did well also - Elizabeth Hurley made a pretty good devil (though I don't think I'll ever be very impressed with her acting abilities... luckily all she had to do was pout and act sexy in this movie) and I was dazzled (pun intended!) with the African American actor who played God. In fact, I'd recommend seeing the movie JUST for his part!The only complaint I have is that Brendan Fraser's character goes from being a ridiculed geek at the beginning and then suddenly, after going through all his wishes and ""defeating"" the devil, he becomes Mr. Cool. Granted, these experiences *might* change him a little, but it was treated with a sort of vagueness that bothered me. But that is easy to overlook and it's the only flaw.So if you're looking for a cute movie that'll make you smile, check out ""Bedazzled.""",4,"Dazzled by ""Bedazzled""",1027814400,"07 28, 2002",2002,2098,"['may', 'be', 'bit', 'biased', 'review', 'absolutely', 'love', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'exception', 'George', 'Jungle', 'Dudley', 'Do-Right', 'have', 'adored', 'movie', 'been', 'even', 'so', ""'m"", 'writing', 'review.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'version', 'Bedazzled', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'compare', 'Bedazzled', 'NOT', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'not', 'going', 'win', 'Oscars', 'sure', ""n't"", 'guy', 'ship', 'shouting', ""'m"", 'King', 'World', 'cute', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'make', 'laugh', '*least*', 'once', 'know', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'whole', 'thing.What', 'impressed', 'most', 'Bedazzled', 'was', 'make-up', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'play', '6', 'different', 'characters', 'different', 'person', 'when', 'doing', 'one', 'looking', 'remarkably', 'Oded', 'Fehrer', 'co-star', 'Mummy', 'playing', 'Colombian', 'drug', 'lord', 'being', 'blonde', 'seven-foot-tall', 'basketball', 'player', 'who', 'little', 'short', 'brains', 'little', 'small', 'ummm', 'private', 'area', 'great', 'make-up', 'also', 'cute', 'little', 'story', 'only', 'few', 'cliches', 'enjoyed', 'ending', 'just', 'lead', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'woman', 'wanted', 'ended', 'up', 'someone', 'better.The', 'other', 'actors', 'movie', 'did', 'well', 'also', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'made', 'pretty', 'good', 'devil', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'be', 'very', 'impressed', 'acting', 'abilities', 'luckily', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'pout', 'act', 'sexy', 'movie', 'was', 'dazzled', 'pun', 'intended', 'African', 'American', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'God', 'fact', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'seeing', 'movie', 'JUST', 'part', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'character', 'being', 'ridiculed', 'geek', 'beginning', 'then', 'suddenly', 'going', 'wishes', 'defeating', 'devil', 'Mr', 'Cool', 'Granted', 'experiences', '*might*', 'change', 'little', 'was', 'treated', 'sort', 'vagueness', 'bothered', 'easy', 'overlook', 'only', 'flaw.So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'cute', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'make', 'smile', 'check', 'Bedazzled']",Bedazzled

That's the premise, what happens now?Frasier's character is a nerdy, tech support guy who the devil picks out of the billions of souls on Earth to tempt into selling his soul. Fraser plays this character to a tee. Despite the fact that Fraser isn't really a nerdy type at all, he's gives just the right amount of hesitation and lack of self confidence to pull it off. I can't imagine anyone doing a better job.I can't say the same for Elizabeth Hurley. Her devil is second rate, even though some of her scenes are well written (whenever Frasier meets her, she's doing something evil, making parking meters run out early, putting m&amp;m's in for drugs at a hospital etc.), she just doesn't convince me.Fasier on the other hand is a genius. Despite the mediocrity of the rest of the film, this is a must for any Brendan Fraser fan.

528028,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,B00003CXKJ,Twiddles42,"[4, 7]","Warning, this contains spoilers:As a fan of the 1967 original from Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore (Moore's soundtrack for the movie is worth getting if available, it ROCKS), I didn't know what to expect from Harold Remis - though I was expecting it to be funny and somewhat intelligent.  I think the phrase ""Whoops"" is apropos here.So what do we get?  An utterly stereotypical computer support dweeb, stupid wiener jokes (and I don't mean Oscar Meyer, this is 2000 America we're speaking about), and more dreary physical comedy that makes me long for the original even more.The best thing going for this movie are the interim, between-vignettes where the Devil (Elizabeth Hurley) does something rotten.  Incidents include swapping patients' drugs with candy (which was actually quite funny), causing a multi-car pile-up (good), and writing tickets for cars after making the parking meters expire (direct rip-off from the original, but welcomed all the same).Brendan Frazer (who, unlike Hurley, gets top billing) is dreadfully miscast.  Almost fittingly, there's no soul in his performance.  Hurley did a much better job at acting the role of the Devil.  It also helps that she's British, but please don't come to any conclusions about that.  :-)  Also, the supporting actors (including Orlando Jones, who is a much better comic actor than to appear in this flick) are wasted.One thing that really dragged was that, in the original, when the hapless character wanted out, he'd have to blow a raspberry - often in the most difficult of situations.  This is funny.  What does the guy in the rewrite have to do?  Dial ""666"" on a pager, oh how inventive (not).  This effictively sums up the whole movie:  Mostly unimaginative, with a few surprises.  (since when does a pager have a numeric keypad?!)And the effects.  This movie was cheaply made while trying to look big.  If one of the all-time dark comedies ever made (1992's 'Death Becomes Her') can look convincing with a reasonable budget, why can't Bedazzled 2000?  (Look not-too-carefully and it's painfully obvious, quite often, that the background and the implanted foreground do not match or look convincing.)  Indeed, the original didn't need to resort to mindless eyecandy, so why does the remake have to?  I will give the vignette where the guy becomes a big (well, mostly, and this harks back to the Oscar Meyer gag) basketball player some credit as it does look mostly convincing, but overall...Still, I don't watch movies for effects.  I watch them for content.  B-2k is somewhat funny when I least expected it (again, the interim bits though I can say that the Presidential vignette was the funniest), and I did chuckle and have the occasional ROTFL moment, but mostly it is unintelligent and almost stereotypic of a British entity remade in the hands of Americans.  (or a stereotypic American comedy with all the lame male anatomy jokes, fratboy humor, with only a miniscule amount of wit, if any at all.)Despite it all, I would say this movie IS worth having for $5 or maybe $10, but not for much more.  I'd much rather see the original out, but this new remake does have some going for it - especially after the first 45 minutes.  The original is simply more creative, as a whole.  The 2000 update, while having some moments, just isn't as great, but has enough to make it worth renting or getting for a reasonable price.",3,"Can I have the original 1967 flick on DVD now, please?",1100390400,"11 14, 2004",2004,3383,"['Warning', 'spoilers', 'fan', '1967', 'original', 'Peter', 'Cooke', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'Moore', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'getting', 'available', 'ROCKS', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Harold', 'Remis', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'funny', 'somewhat', 'intelligent', 'think', 'phrase', 'Whoops', 'apropos', 'here.So', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'utterly', 'stereotypical', 'computer', 'support', 'dweeb', 'stupid', 'wiener', 'jokes', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Oscar', 'Meyer', '2000', 'America', ""'re"", 'speaking', 'more', 'dreary', 'physical', 'comedy', 'long', 'original', 'even', 'more.The', 'best', 'thing', 'going', 'movie', 'are', 'interim', 'between-vignettes', 'where', 'Devil', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'something', 'rotten', 'Incidents', 'include', 'swapping', 'patients', 'drugs', 'candy', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'funny', 'causing', 'multi-car', 'pile-up', 'good', 'writing', 'tickets', 'cars', 'making', 'parking', 'meters', 'expire', 'direct', 'rip-off', 'original', 'welcomed', 'same', '.Brendan', 'Frazer', 'who', 'Hurley', 'top', 'billing', 'dreadfully', 'miscast', 'Almost', 'fittingly', 'soul', 'performance', 'Hurley', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'acting', 'role', 'Devil', 'also', 'British', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'conclusions', 'Also', 'supporting', 'actors', 'including', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'who', 'much', 'better', 'comic', 'actor', 'appear', 'flick', 'are', 'wasted.One', 'thing', 'really', 'dragged', 'was', 'original', 'when', 'hapless', 'character', 'wanted', 'out', ""'d"", 'have', 'blow', 'raspberry', 'often', 'most', 'difficult', 'situations', 'funny', 'What', 'guy', 'rewrite', 'have', 'do', 'Dial', '666', 'pager', 'oh', 'how', 'inventive', 'not', 'effictively', 'up', 'whole', 'movie', 'Mostly', 'unimaginative', 'few', 'surprises', 'when', 'pager', 'have', 'numeric', 'keypad', 'effects', 'movie', 'was', 'cheaply', 'made', 'trying', 'look', 'big', 'one', 'all-time', 'dark', 'comedies', 'ever', 'made', '1992', ""'Death"", 'Becomes', 'Her', 'can', 'look', 'convincing', 'reasonable', 'budget', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Bedazzled', '2000', 'Look', 'not-too-carefully', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'quite', 'often', 'background', 'implanted', 'foreground', 'do', 'not', 'match', 'look', 'convincing', 'Indeed', 'original', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'resort', 'mindless', 'eyecandy', 'so', 'why', 'remake', 'have', 'will', 'give', 'vignette', 'where', 'guy', 'big', 'well', 'mostly', 'back', 'Oscar', 'Meyer', 'gag', 'basketball', 'player', 'credit', 'look', 'mostly', 'convincing', 'overall', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movies', 'effects', 'watch', 'content', 'B-2k', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'when', 'least', 'expected', 'again', 'interim', 'bits', 'can', 'say', 'Presidential', 'vignette', 'was', 'funniest', 'did', 'chuckle', 'have', 'occasional', 'ROTFL', 'moment', 'mostly', 'unintelligent', 'almost', 'stereotypic', 'British', 'entity', 'remade', 'hands', 'Americans', 'stereotypic', 'American', 'comedy', 'lame', 'male', 'anatomy', 'jokes', 'fratboy', 'humor', 'only', 'miniscule', 'amount', 'wit', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'worth', 'having', '5', 'maybe', '10', 'not', 'much', 'more', ""'d"", 'much', 'rather', 'see', 'original', 'out', 'new', 'remake', 'have', 'going', 'especially', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'original', 'simply', 'more', 'creative', 'whole', '2000', 'update', 'having', 'moments', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'enough', 'make', 'worth', 'renting', 'getting', 'reasonable', 'price']",Bedazzled
