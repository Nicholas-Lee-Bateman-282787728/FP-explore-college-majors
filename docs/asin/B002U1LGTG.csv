1289375,A1DQHS7MOVYYYA,B002U1LGTG,A. Boston,"[7, 10]","It's hard for me to give movies a bad rating -- as long as I'm entertained, I'm good. This movie actually kinda creeped me out. Being a fan of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, I thought it was a cute idea for Nia Vardalos and John Corbett to do another movie together. How could it be bad, right? It was. very. bad.The premise is that Nia's character, Genevieve is a florist. She loves romance, and she sticks to her belief that there should only be 5 dates with any guy. The best parts of being with someone occur during those 5 dates. Then, she just stops seeing them. So there's no pain,""only happiness"". and then she meets Greg(John Corbett) and they begin their 5 dates.She walks around with this weird perma-grin. While I usually find Nia Vardalos charming, she was just downright odd in this. Her character almost made me uncomfortable, being so happy and constantly smiling. Not only that, but with the smiling came a possessed look in her eye. I have nothing wrong with happiness, I love romantic comedies. But this was just uncalled for. It was almost like stage acting for film....and to me it actually ruined the whole movie. The idea is cute, but the execution was just lacking. It was so cookie cutter and predictable. I was actually looking forward to Genevieve's failure, to slap her back to reality. The ending didn't make me happy, it just made me excited the movie was over. None of the other characters developed, and Genevieve barely did either. Everything was so even across the board with no ebb and flow to the personality development.I think how this differs from My Big Fat Greek Wedding is this: that movie is relatable. Whether we're Greek or not, we all have those crazy family members. We love to see the nerdy girl blossom and meet that great guy. You can look forward to comedy and adorable characters. This movie: who wants to just waste time going on just 5 dates? Who wants to just feel constantly one feeling? You watch a character that's just been running away from a pretty normal problem that upset her and pretending it never happened. Ick.

We both loved My Big Fat Greek Wedding and we even liked the not-as-good My Life in Ruins, despite its fairly trite storyline. But this movies is really really bad, to the point that we gave up after about 30 minutes and decided to watch once again one of our favorites in this genre (Wimbledon).This movie is terrible, literally one of the worst I have seen in years. Immensely stupid characters (all of them, main and secondary ones), intolerable acting, trivial storyline, embarrassing screenplay. Vardalos (who is also guilty of directing the movie and writing the screenplay) is intolerable in her role as an obtuse nymphomaniac who refuses commitment and has pre-set, inflexible rules for how and how long dating should proceed. She keeps the same identical, immutable obtuse smile for the first 30 minutes of the movie (perhaps later she will turn somber for 5 seconds when 1. she falls in love with the male character and 2. when the ""problems"" stage of the romantic comedy will predictably arrive). Her friends just love her and even listen to her, when they should call in a psychiatrist. All characters are, to say the least, constructed of cliches. The gay co-workers are an insult to homosexuality and their behavior and dialogue just an agglomeration of stereotypes.My advice is, forget about this movie, don't even rent it and keep in mind that having liked Greek Wedding (as we did) is no guarantee that you will even want to finish watching this one. Vardalos really needs moving on, or at least she needs a decent screenwriter. This C-movie is a scam packaged for suckers such as myself who think (I should say thought) that Vardalos=nice romantic comedy.

I'll have a few criticisms in a minute, but honestly, compared to many recent romantic movies, I thought this one wasn't too bad. It certainly won't ever make the list of best chick flicks, but it's not a bad movie if you just want a feel-good movie. Nia Vardelos has an uneven performance, sometimes looking enticing and other times looking ridiculous. The chemistry between her and John Corbett isn't too bad. Corbett seems a little uneven himself as a restaurant owner, but in the end it kind of works out. The premise of only having 5 dates seems to start out better than it ends. It makes for some interesting encounters at first, but gets a bit old in the end. In any case, if you like chick flicks, I would recommend trying this one out.

An unfunny, insipid, character-less piece of affectionate schlock, aka ""I Hate Valentine's Day"".  I rather see that N'Sync fellow make another dirty Greek joke.Part of what makes this movie unfunny is the abundance of awkward silences.  An awkward silence joke usually works when a character is outrageously goofy to begin with and the line is so panned out that the crowd's silence is actually funny;even dry, uncomfortable silence can be funny.  However, when John Corbett's character, Greg, made a comment about 'Get On Tapas' and no one spoke, it's neither goofy nor dry-humor.  It's just awkward, and the same joke's been used at least three more times; it wasn't funny the first time around.  None of the cast tried to put in the effort to make the witty banter less bland than they already were, and how they deliever them were absolutely cringe-worthy, like how that girl was making a scrapbook for her stalkee of the day.  What's really insufferable is the main character, Genevieve (played by director/co-star Nia Vardalos).  It's irritating by the way she almost always smiled and has a cheerful outlook, even when she made a cynical comment; she's rather disturbing than wholesome, and come to think of, Nia's like that in all of her films.  As for her love interest/trophy guy, Greg, well if you've seen ""Greek"" and ""United States of Tara"", you know Corbett is playing the same darn character.I can enjoya good romancenow and then, but this film is a romcom to a soulless and manufactured degree.  The only good thing I can say about the movie is it's harmless.  In fact, it's so safe, I wonder why it's rated PG-13 in the first place?  Okay, Genevieve showed her panties in a 'cheeky comedic' scene and a couple of comments on pregnancy were mentioned, but otherwise, I doubt these are something mid-west suburban housewifes would get into a fit.  As I end this review, I have to ask, why is it called ""I Hate Valentine's Day""?  The whole hook of the title didn't happen until the last ten minutes, and even then, it's never really about the holiday.  It's about not committing to relationships, so why wasn't it called ""I Hate Relationships""?

Fortunately I was able to watch it in the privacy of my own home and was therefore able to end the pain after forty-five minutes.  If someone had forced me to sit through the entire thing, I would have dropped it down to only one star.Apparently Nia Vardalos wrote the screenplay, directed and starred in this film.  I would have to lay much of the blame upon the producer for allowing her to wear so many hats but she was probably the producer as well.  To know for sure would require me to actually sit through the opening credits again and I would rather undergo another root canal than have to spend any more time watching this film.Frankly I've seen examples of better directing on YouTube videos, and most of those films were shot using only one camera.  Anyone who attended more than the first week of a high-school film directing class knows that you can't simply alternate chest shots of two speaking actors for several minutes without putting your audience to sleep, and that changing to an occasional over-the-shoulder shot doesn't break the monotony.  Maybe Ms. Vardalos missed class the day that they taught something called the ""two shot,"" or maybe she also served as the editor on the film.  As I have already mentioned, I'm certainly not going to spend any more time watching the credits to find out.Of course the problem with directing your own performance is that there is no one who can tell you that your performance might be improved if you would simply vary your facial expression from time to time during the course of the movie.  Maybe Ms. Varalos did dig down into her bag of acting tricks to come up with something other than the same frozen smile during the second half of the film, but I doubt it.  From what I observed, her bag of tricks is about the size of a change purse.Sadly the fact that Valentine's Day is contained within the film's title almost guarantees a certain number of rentals or purchases in  every future February by unsuspecting persons.

1289385,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002U1LGTG,Ed Uyeshima,"[11, 16]","In a year crowded with bad romantic comedies (New In Town,Bride Wars,The Ugly Truth), this barely released 2009 film has to be the worst of a bad lot. Coming off another bad romantic comedy (My Life in Ruins) which was slightly redeemed by the use of actual Greek locations, the usually likable Nia Vardalos (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) made a serious mistake in playing triple duty here - writer, director and star - which basically means she was left on her own to determine the sensibility of her story, set the right tone, and emote in an empathetic fashion. She fails miserably on all three counts. Vardalos plays Genevieve, a Brooklyn florist who has invented the particular contrivance of a five-date maximum for any man with whom she gets involved. Due to a predictable plot device, she believes all relationships are fundamentally doomed and that it's best to get the most that you can from those five dates and then leave.Because this fabricated quirk motivates this sitcom-level character, she naturally meets her match in Greg, a handsome yet socially awkward restaurateur, who walks into her shop. Casting her former ""Wedding"" co-star John Corbett in this role may have seemed like a good idea on paper, but Vardalos the screenwriter leaves them mired in clich&eacute;s until the inevitable occurs. I believe the fortyish Vardalos is trying to come across as a lovable free spirit as Genevieve, but with her frozen smile, she merely looks mechanical when expressing her idiotic philosophy. By contrast, Corbett looks tentative and frankly embarrassed to be in this venture. A promising supporting cast which includes Zoe Kazan, Jay O. Sanders, and Judah Friedlander, has been assembled and then promptly shafted by the ill-conceived script and slow pacing.  The production details are amateurish, and Keith Power's original music is loud and irritating.

Nia Vardalos adds a lot of clean, relatable, everywoman charm to her characters and her movies.  This charm that was bursting from the seams of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is still evident through ""I Hate Valentines Day."" Nia has slicked up her image and wardrobe for this character, choosing her wardrobe colors from the palette of Valentine colors and spring blossoms. But Genevieve still has that practical Nia sense of humor which she shared with Toula, which shows in such lines as, ""One armed dresses are just wrong--one arm's warm...Oh! the other arm's cold!"" But the best part of all is that she is reunited with her ""MBFGW"" costar, John Corbett, with whom she still has the undeniable chemistry which made that film so believable. Fans of MBFGW will find something to like here.

1289397,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B002U1LGTG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[13, 14]","In ""I Hate Valentine's Day,"" Genevieve (Nia Vardalos) runs a flower show in Brooklyn, where she dispenses bouquets and advice to the love lorn with joyous abandon.  Having been disappointed by the men in her life, from her estranged father to her first boyfriends, Genevieve has developed a iron-clad policy of only going on five dates.  She tells all of her gal pals to do the same thing, and glares at them when they are tempted to deviate from her proscribed path, all the while smiling with an intensity that will make your teeth hurt.  Genevieve even has a general description for each of the five dates, just so the guy knows how things are supposed to go.  Then she meets Greg (John Corbett), who wants to open a tapas bar down the street.  Obviously, this is a guy worthy of way more than a mere five dates, but just as obviously it is going to take Genevieve almost the entire movie to reach that conclusion.  Part of the problem turns out to be that there is some confusion as to whether their last date was the fourth date or the fifth date.  He thinks that it was and dutifully disappears from her life, while she thinks it was not and wonders why he is not calling her for their final date.The fact of the matter is that she is right about it only being the fourth date, but, more importantly, she is wrong to have her five date plan, a conclusion that you pretty much reach as soon as Genevieve explains it for the first time. But what becomes so disconcerting is that the utter trivilaity of the former is such a stupid impediment to dealing with the stupid rules of the latter.  Besides, I did not really pick up on the descriptions of the five rules when I watched the film (the trailer makes them a lot clearer), so I was trying to remember what they were to figure out why Greg thinks the fourth date became the fifth and final date.  Meanwhile, we are only halfway through the film, so Genevieve and Greg are treading water in inane ways before we get to the requisite happy ending.  By that point I was becoming convinced that these two were better off without each other and starting to get creeped out by Genevieve having that omnipresent smile plastered on her face.  The plot was dictating these two should end up together, but the rightness of that was not resonating with me that much.  The unhappy couple are surrounded by a rather forgettable set of friends and co-workers, despite having the likes of Ian Gomez, Rachel Dratz, and Judah Friedlander, amongst other semi-recognizable faces.My favorite moment in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" comes when Ian and Toula are on their first date at a restaurant and Ian comes up with the idea of going out again to a Greek restaurant that he has been to, which happens to be the one owned by Toula's parents.  In your average romantic comedy there would be a funny scene where the couple goes to the restaurant and everybody tries to pretend they do not know each other and at some point the comic confusion results in the revelation of the truth, so on and so forth.  But instead writer and star Vardalos has Toula admit that it is her family's restaurant.  Ian looks at her and remembers Toula from before.  This was back when Toula was the frumpy ugly duckling, but this does not matter to Ian.  ""I remember you,"" he says, and it is clear that this does not change what he thinks about Toula one iota.  It is a lovely scene, and Vardalos and Corbett had wonderful chemistry in both that moment and the entire movie.  So when the two co-starred again in ""I Hate Valentine's Day,"" not only written this time but also directed by Vardalos (who came up with the script when the studio handed her the title), I was hoping that lightning would strike twice.  But there is nothing in this 2009 romantic comedy that holds a candle to the best moments in the film that still helds the record for grossing the most money ($241 million in North America) without ever hitting #1 at the box office.  Consequently, this is not just a bad romantic comedy, it is quite a disappointing one as well because of our fond memories of that earlier movie.",2,Lightning does not strike again for Nia Vardalos and John Corbett,1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,4104,"['Hate', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'Genevieve', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'flower', 'show', 'Brooklyn', 'where', 'bouquets', 'advice', 'love', 'lorn', 'joyous', 'abandon', 'Having', 'been', 'disappointed', 'men', 'life', 'estranged', 'father', 'first', 'boyfriends', 'Genevieve', 'developed', 'iron-clad', 'policy', 'only', 'going', 'five', 'dates', 'gal', 'pals', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'glares', 'when', 'are', 'tempted', 'deviate', 'proscribed', 'path', 'while', 'smiling', 'intensity', 'will', 'make', 'teeth', 'hurt', 'Genevieve', 'even', 'general', 'description', 'five', 'dates', 'just', 'guy', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'supposed', 'go', 'Then', 'Greg', 'John', 'Corbett', 'who', 'open', 'tapas', 'bar', 'street', 'Obviously', 'guy', 'worthy', 'way', 'more', 'mere', 'five', 'dates', 'just', 'obviously', 'going', 'take', 'Genevieve', 'almost', 'entire', 'movie', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'Part', 'problem', 'out', 'be', 'confusion', 'last', 'date', 'was', 'fourth', 'date', 'fifth', 'date', 'was', 'dutifully', 'disappears', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'wonders', 'why', 'not', 'calling', 'final', 'date.The', 'fact', 'matter', 'right', 'only', 'being', 'fourth', 'date', 'more', 'importantly', 'wrong', 'have', 'five', 'date', 'plan', 'conclusion', 'pretty', 'much', 'reach', 'as', 'soon', 'Genevieve', 'first', 'time', 'what', 'so', 'disconcerting', 'utter', 'trivilaity', 'former', 'such', 'stupid', 'impediment', 'dealing', 'stupid', 'rules', 'latter', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'pick', 'up', 'descriptions', 'five', 'rules', 'when', 'watched', 'film', 'trailer', 'lot', 'clearer', 'so', 'was', 'trying', 'remember', 'what', 'were', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Greg', 'fourth', 'date', 'became', 'fifth', 'final', 'date', 'Meanwhile', 'are', 'only', 'halfway', 'film', 'Genevieve', 'Greg', 'are', 'treading', 'water', 'inane', 'ways', 'get', 'requisite', 'happy', 'ending', 'point', 'was', 'becoming', 'convinced', 'two', 'were', 'better', 'other', 'starting', 'get', 'creeped', 'out', 'Genevieve', 'having', 'omnipresent', 'smile', 'plastered', 'face', 'plot', 'was', 'dictating', 'two', 'should', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'rightness', 'was', 'not', 'resonating', 'much', 'unhappy', 'couple', 'are', 'surrounded', 'rather', 'forgettable', 'set', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'having', 'likes', 'Ian', 'Gomez', 'Rachel', 'Dratz', 'Judah', 'Friedlander', 'other', 'semi-recognizable', 'faces.My', 'favorite', 'moment', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'when', 'Ian', 'Toula', 'are', 'first', 'date', 'restaurant', 'Ian', 'up', 'idea', 'going', 'out', 'again', 'Greek', 'restaurant', 'been', 'be', 'one', 'owned', 'Toula', 'parents', 'average', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'couple', 'restaurant', 'everybody', 'tries', 'pretend', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'other', 'point', 'comic', 'confusion', 'results', 'revelation', 'truth', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'instead', 'writer', 'star', 'Vardalos', 'Toula', 'admit', 'family', 'restaurant', 'Ian', 'remembers', 'Toula', 'before', 'was', 'back', 'when', 'Toula', 'was', 'frumpy', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'not', 'matter', 'Ian', 'remember', 'clear', 'not', 'change', 'what', 'Toula', 'one', 'iota', 'lovely', 'scene', 'Vardalos', 'Corbett', 'had', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'moment', 'entire', 'movie', 'So', 'when', 'two', 'co-starred', 'again', 'Hate', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'not', 'only', 'written', 'time', 'also', 'directed', 'Vardalos', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'script', 'when', 'studio', 'handed', 'title', 'was', 'hoping', 'lightning', 'would', 'strike', 'twice', 'nothing', '2009', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'candle', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'still', 'record', 'grossing', 'most', 'money', '241', 'million', 'North', 'America', 'ever', 'hitting', '1', 'box', 'office', 'Consequently', 'not', 'just', 'bad', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'fond', 'memories', 'earlier', 'movie']",N/A

I can relate to some of the points mentioned here but won't go into it because there is a lot worse out there in terms of romantic comedy and comedy in general.First the good: Nia Vardalos is just plain cute!!!!!  Sorry but that's how I feel.  It breaks my heart to know that she's married.......oh well.Her movies are formulaic and predictable but as a rule; romantic comedies usually are and that didn't go unnoticed by other reviewers here.BUT...I would rather watch her predictable and formulaic movies that watch the garbage that Tyler Perry puts out.  I'm sure I'll get some flack for that but his stuff affects me the same way several of the negative reviews of Nia Vardalos movies affect them.Then there is the master of the format.......Neil Simon.  If you've seen one of his movies; you've seen them all.

Corbett's character is the new business owner who opens a restaurant near her shop. Dating ensues, as does a plethora of cliches, bad writing, unlikeable characters and awkward moments. The Blu clarity is average to poor depending on the camera, with the colors showing a bit of oversaturation throughout. The only extra on the BD (a commentary) provided some insight as to how some of the footage resulted in such a poor transfer (they were unintentionally admitting why). The worst part about this commentary (Nia and some crew) was them stating how proud they were of so many things about this film, including how they managed to keep the crew out of the window reflections; when in fact there were entire sequences where the camera crew, script reader, boom guy, bystanders, etc. are all obvious. They also mentioned how they used stock footage fromGhost Town [Blu-ray] for some of the exteriors (can be a real distraction while watching a film when the clarity drastically changes from scene to scene), and various other exteriors look as if they were downscaled with there being so much grain and distortion. Corbett does fine but the supporting cast is painful and not fun to watch.The sound is a low grade 5.1, subtitled in English and Spanish, region coded A. Overall, not worth the time in Blu, and watching the film will most likely be mandatory for a few sufferers this Valentine's week, so the best recommendation I could come up with is maybe a rental.",2,"A below average love film, a disappointing Blu",1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,1822,"['was', 'initially', 'pleased', 'see', 'Nia', 'Vardalos', 'branch', 'out', 'writing', 'directing', 'hopefully', 'get', 'typecast', 'customers', 'see', 'now', 'film', 'was', 'setback', 'more', 'anything', 'else.This', 'New', 'York', 'story', 'floral', 'shop', 'owner', 'Vardalos', 'who', 'set', 'lame', 'rules', 'disallow', 'dating', 'life', 'go', 'few', 'outings', 'man', 'Corbett', 'character', 'new', 'business', 'owner', 'who', 'restaurant', 'shop', 'Dating', 'ensues', 'plethora', 'cliches', 'bad', 'writing', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'awkward', 'moments', 'Blu', 'clarity', 'average', 'poor', 'depending', 'camera', 'colors', 'showing', 'bit', 'oversaturation', 'only', 'extra', 'BD', 'commentary', 'provided', 'insight', 'how', 'footage', 'resulted', 'such', 'poor', 'transfer', 'were', 'unintentionally', 'admitting', 'why', 'worst', 'part', 'commentary', 'Nia', 'crew', 'was', 'stating', 'how', 'proud', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'film', 'including', 'how', 'managed', 'keep', 'crew', 'window', 'reflections', 'when', 'fact', 'were', 'entire', 'sequences', 'where', 'camera', 'crew', 'script', 'reader', 'boom', 'guy', 'bystanders', 'etc', 'are', 'obvious', 'also', 'mentioned', 'how', 'used', 'stock', 'footage', 'fromGhost', 'Town', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'exteriors', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'distraction', 'watching', 'film', 'when', 'clarity', 'drastically', 'changes', 'scene', 'scene', 'various', 'other', 'exteriors', 'look', 'were', 'downscaled', 'being', 'so', 'much', 'grain', 'distortion', 'Corbett', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'painful', 'not', 'fun', 'watch.The', 'sound', 'low', 'grade', '5.1', 'subtitled', 'English', 'Spanish', 'region', 'coded', 'A', 'Overall', 'not', 'time', 'Blu', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'mandatory', 'few', 'sufferers', 'Valentine', 'week', 'best', 'recommendation', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'maybe', 'rental']",N/A
