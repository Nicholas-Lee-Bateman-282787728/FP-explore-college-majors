1622586,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00B6OEDY8,Grady Harp,"[8, 8]","DOWN THE SHORE is one of those little sensitive films that seems like it is lightweight until the secrets of the story begin to leak. It is a film about thwarted human relations that have a core of ill-define tragic misconceptions. It is well written (by Sandra Jennings), well directed  (by Harold Guskin) and happens to provide a showcase for some inordinately gifted actors who usually are not given the attention they deserve.The film opens in Paris where a handsome Jacques (the very impressive Italian actor Edoardo Costa) is cranking a carousel for children in a little park. Observing him is a winsome Susan (Maria Dizzia) who speaks no French but in a rare moment of instant chemical gaze we can see that she and Jacques connect. Susan hires Jacques to be her guide while she is in Paris - and then we see them no more. The scene changes to 3 months later when Jacques comes to Susan's home in New Jersey, meets her brother Bailey (a brilliant role for James Gandolfini), informs Bailey that Susan is dead, and gives Bailey a letter and Susan's ashes and informs Bailey that he and Susan were married in France: the letter confirms that Jacques is to own half of Susan's house which she shared with Bailey and Jacques suggests he and Bailey be partners.  Bailey runs a small carnival park on the Jersey shore and Jacques is able to help him bring life back into the children's rides.The other part of the story concerns Mary (Famke Janssen in excellent form) who is Bailey's childhood sweetheart but now married to Bailey's best friend, the covertly abusive crack addict Wiley (Joe Pope) who happens to own the little carnival park where Bailey works. Some talk between the two men suggests that their fathers were bad men but Wiley inherited his father's wealth and park and married Mary with whom he had a mentally challenged son Martin (John Magaro) while Bailey has remained single living with his sister Susan. The secrets of why Wiley is addicted to crack and physically abuses Mary while Bailey seems to do nothing about the woman he still loves is brought into focus by the wise Jacques, the one person who seems to be adjusted and happy despite his wife's recent death from cancer. In talks with both Bailey and Wiley, Jacques uncovers the horrid secrets that have bruised everyone's lives and what those secrets mean, and how the story works out must be withheld until the viewer experiences this film.A stronger cast could not be imagined for this well written, well-directed film. The degree of identification with absolutely every character in the film is truly remarkable. This is a tale of the maladaptation to secrets of the past. And one of the many beauties of the film is the manner in which much is left unresolved or unsaid at the end.

1622588,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00B6OEDY8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","Maybe it's just me, but the Garden State always seems to be the setting for downbeat family dramas. ""Down The Shore"" is just one more example of desperate souls living in disappointment and regret as the world they knew crumbles around them. If you watch a lot of indie films, you will instantly recognize the template that characterizes many of these stories. Therefore, I was initially wary of ""Down The Shore."" I was afraid it wasn't going to be able to offer me anything new. And in many ways, it didn't. As the movie progresses, dark secrets are revealed, old passions are rekindled, and new betrayals are uncovered. Three childhood friends (James Gandolfini, Famke Janssen, and Joe Pope) are at the center of this tale. Their lives will come crashing down around them on deserted Jersey beaches and dilapidated boardwalk amusement parks. And yet, due to the grounded performances, I was won over by the film's intimacy and sadness.Gandolfini plays a down-on-his luck amusement vendor, held captive by the downturned economy. News of his sister's death strikes him very hard, but that isn't the biggest shock. She had gotten married in Paris and her new husband has arrived in New Jersey to claim his half of the house Galdolfini inhabits. No real explanation is given as to why this move would be appealing to him, you just have to go with it. But that's okay because Edoardo Costa brings a lively unpredictability to the proceedings as the new arrival. Next door, Pope and Janssen play a troubled couple who are both very close to Gandolfini. The three have a complicated past. As the present becomes more strained for this trio, however, perhaps having an outsider around (in the form of Costa) will help them sort out both their history and their future. Things get progressively darker as deep secrets bubble to the surface.""Down The Shore"" has a slow build tension that kind of sneaks up on you. Gandolfini is solid, oftentimes stoic in the face of emotional devastation. Janssen is also particularly good. I don't think she's given credit sometimes for being as effective as she is. These two are the sturdy center of the movie. Pope, however, has a showier role. Mixing charm with danger, he is an interesting actor to watch. And then there's Costa, who I thought was absolutely terrific. As the script veers toward melodrama, these fine actors keep you connected. And what might have been turned into an overwrought chamber piece still manages to feel believable and heartfelt. Despite my early misgivings, I was won over by ""Down The Shore."" Next time, though, can the Jersey Shore tourist board encourage something a bit more upbeat?

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[13, 15]","This small independent film puts Sopranos' star James Gandolfini back in northern New Jersey in a small seaside resort town (which is never identified by name.) This time he is not a gangster but a single guy, who once had a high school sweetheart (the girl who, literally, lived next door) but she married one of his ""best friends"". He now runs the train ride in the small amusement park owned by that ""friend"". When his sister goes off to Paris and doesn't come back he is forlorn until a man from France comes to visit him and ends up changing his life forever. To tell you any more would spoil the surprises and drama that seep out slowing in the 93 minute film. Gandolfini gets a lot of screen time and his range of emotions is well chosen. The rest of the cast is excellent two including actress Famke Janssen (X-men) as the former girlfriend, now the mother of a developmentally disabled teenager.I'm sure this film played very few theaters but it's the kind of film that's great to discover on home video. No  Oscars here but a story that will keep you interested.It's interesting that even the Bluray version - which really didn't appear to be very HD - has no extra features or bonuses - not even the trailer.
