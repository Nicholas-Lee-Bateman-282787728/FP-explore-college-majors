It is really the type that you can do at your own pace.  I have done Tae Bo before, and although it was a good workout, I found Billy Blanks EXTREMELY annoying.  I hated the way he &quot;preached&quot; throughout the entire workout.  This video is much more of what I am used to in an exercise video.  It is well worth the money, especially since the DVD version that I have comes with a 45 minute version and a 60 minute version (I don't know if the VHS tape comes with both versions). This is great to switch up your workouts.  This workout is very similar to TaeBo and I would recommed it highly to anyone who likes that type of workout.

1848,A2SAVTYOEBSNPF,0738920525,"Alyce In Wonderland ""The Looking Glass""","[3, 3]","Important Note for Beginners:If you have been working out regularly, and want to get into kickboxing aerobics, start here with Kathy Smith and Keith Cooke.  If you are totally out of shape, start with something easier that will help you build some strength and endurance before you get into this DVD.  I'd suggest starting withExtreme Makeover Fitness - Weight Loss Workout for Beginners.**This is a kickboxing AEROBICS video.  It is meant to give you a workout that is based upon kickboxing.  It's not intended to teach you how to do professional kickboxing.  If you want a fun and challenging workout, kickboxing aerobics is a great choice.**I'm in great shape because of kickboxing aerobics.  It's one of the few cardio exercises that really works the whole body at once.  It's also empowering and fun.Few kickboxing aerobic DVDs teach you proper form.  This one does.  Keith Cooke is a professional with multiple titles, who teaches real kickboxing classes.  He is given a side window on your screen throughout the workout.  He teaches you proper footing, form and how to execute the drills safely. Kathy Smith does the main aerobics instruction.  She offers a few alterations for beginners.  She also helps Cooke keep the instruction going at times when he gets too quiet.  As a team, these two give you all you need to get started and to practice drills that will help you keep proper form.WHO TO WATCH:BEGINNERS:Watch Kathy Smith.  (Watch Keith Cooke when he is given the side windows.  He is going to teach you how to execute the punches and kicks properly.)  Kathy Smith will show you easier alterations to some of the tougher moves.INTERMEDIATES:Watch Keith Cooke or the female behind him, to the left.  (She is introduced as Murmur, dressed in black and white.)  Keith and Murmur have almost identical form.  While the rest of the instructors tend to be a bit ""dancy"", these two are no- nonsense boxers.  They have a lot of energy and tons of power behind their kicks and punches.  Keeping up with Keith's speed will make you sweat, no matter how in shape you are.I don't suggest following the third main instructor (Kelly Roberts).  She tends to throw her body awkwardly off balance while kicking and punching.  She's very ""showy"" and doesn't really follow Keith's suggestions for form.HOW TO ADD MORE CHALLENGE:Use weighted gloves and ankle weights.  I useAltus Athletic AWK-PK Pink Walk Kit.  While I hate pink, this set of gloves and ankle weights is mostly black with pink trim.  However, the price ($19.99 for the set of gloves and ankles all together) is right and quality is good.Do Keith's ""Kickboxing Challenge"".  If you do the whole 55 minute ""kickboxing challenge workout"", you'll have Keith's 5 minutes of challenging combos at the end.  If you want to do just his 5 minute challenge, you'll find it under the main menu in ""choose your own workout"".Double- time the kicks and punches when Kathy slows down to teach beginners the moves.  By the time this video loses it's challenge for you, you'll know the moves well enough to get right into doing them at tempo.Once you have the moves down, you might want to try some more kickboxing DVDs.  Here are some suggestions:Quickfix - Total Cardio Kick(Beginners.  You can do this before Kathy Smith/Keith Cooke.  Just know that you won't be taught proper form.  Do it only for a fun workout.)Janis Saffell Kickbox Strike Zone(Easy to Intermediate levels.)Hard Core Kickbox Circuit(Easy to Harder Intermediate levels.)",5,"Perfect for teaching you the basics, and for helping you keep your form.

1854,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,0738920525,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[65, 66]","This was my first kickboxing video, and I really enjoyed it.  I was a bit hesitant to try it because I don't generally like aerobics videos--I find all that &quot;take it from the top&quot; really boring--but I'm glad I gave this workout a chance.  At the start of the video, Ketih Cooke, a well-known kickboxer, provides main instructor Kathy Smith with simple explanations of each of the punches and kicks that will be used in the workout.  This brief overview was helpful, but once you learn the moves, you can skip over this part.Following the instructive segment, Kathy Smith takes over.  The workout begins with a warmup which lasts about 10 minutes.  This provides the opportunity for you to get used to the movements, but don't be fooled by the &quot;warmup&quot; label--your heart rate will definitely be elevated during this section, and you will sweat!  Next comes the 25-minute kickboxing workout.  During this section, you will practice punches and kicks, starting slowly and then building up to a faster pace.  Kathy was easy to follow, and she gradually worked up to basic punch-kick combinations which were simple to learn yet to fun to do.  I did find myself getting pretty tired during this segment, but I was able to keep up by modifying the intensity slightly (eg, keeping my feet on the ground during the hops from side to side).  At the end of this section, two short combinations are presented by Keith Cooke and another well-known instructor, Keli Roberts.  I liked that these combinations were a bit different yet still easy to learn and that the repetitions of each were kept to a minimum.  Throughout the workout, there were times when I felt like I might not be doing the moves exactly right, but I still enjoyed myself--all that punching and kicking felt GOOD!After the kickboxing workout ends, there is a 5-minute section focusing on the legs and glutes.  In this segment, you practice the kicks more slowly, combining them with squats and holding on to a chair for balance.  This was a nice way to reinforce what you learned during the workout, and I think that continued practice of this section will help to improve my kickboxing skills.  Finally, the workout ends with a 5-minute cool down performed seated in a chair.  These moves provided nice stretches for the thighs and glutes (although at one point, Kathy forgets to perform a squat stretch on the opposite side), and when they were over, I felt thoroughly stretched.I can't compare this video to Tae Bo, as I've never tried those workouts.  However, I CAN say that this was a fun, high-energy video that left me feeling strong and powerful rather than exhausted.  It was perfect for a kickboxing beginner like me, but it was also challenging enough to provide even non-beginners with a great workout.  Kathy Smith has a nice, easygoing style and provides good overall instruction.  There were a few times when I thought she failed to adequately cue a change in movement, but the workout was so easy to follow along that it wasn't hard to replicate the movements after the first repetition or two.  I'm thrilled to have finally found a cardio video that is truly enjoyable, and I look forward to doing this video as part of my regular rotation.",5,So THIS is why people love kickboxing!,1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,3234,"['was', 'first', 'kickboxing', 'video', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'bit', 'hesitant', 'try', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'like', 'aerobics', 'videos', 'find', 'quot', 'take', 'top', 'quot', 'really', 'boring', ""'m"", 'glad', 'gave', 'workout', 'chance', 'start', 'video', 'Ketih', 'Cooke', 'well-known', 'kickboxer', 'main', 'instructor', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'simple', 'explanations', 'punches', 'kicks', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'workout', 'brief', 'overview', 'was', 'helpful', 'once', 'learn', 'moves', 'can', 'skip', 'part.Following', 'instructive', 'segment', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'workout', 'warmup', '10', 'minutes', 'opportunity', 'get', 'used', 'movements', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'quot', 'quot', 'heart', 'rate', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'elevated', 'section', 'will', 'sweat', 'Next', '25-minute', 'kickboxing', 'workout', 'section', 'will', 'practice', 'punches', 'kicks', 'starting', 'slowly', 'then', 'building', 'up', 'faster', 'pace', 'Kathy', 'was', 'easy', 'follow', 'gradually', 'worked', 'up', 'basic', 'punch-kick', 'combinations', 'were', 'simple', 'learn', 'yet', 'fun', 'do', 'did', 'find', 'getting', 'pretty', 'tired', 'segment', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'modifying', 'intensity', 'slightly', 'eg', 'keeping', 'feet', 'ground', 'hops', 'side', 'side', 'end', 'section', 'two', 'short', 'combinations', 'are', 'presented', 'Keith', 'Cooke', 'well-known', 'instructor', 'Keli', 'Roberts', 'liked', 'combinations', 'were', 'bit', 'different', 'yet', 'still', 'easy', 'learn', 'repetitions', 'were', 'kept', 'minimum', 'workout', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'felt', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'doing', 'moves', 'exactly', 'right', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'punching', 'kicking', 'felt', 'GOOD', 'kickboxing', 'workout', 'ends', '5-minute', 'section', 'focusing', 'legs', 'glutes', 'segment', 'practice', 'kicks', 'more', 'slowly', 'combining', 'squats', 'holding', 'chair', 'balance', 'was', 'nice', 'way', 'reinforce', 'what', 'learned', 'workout', 'think', 'continued', 'practice', 'section', 'will', 'help', 'improve', 'kickboxing', 'skills', 'Finally', 'workout', '5-minute', 'cool', 'down', 'performed', 'seated', 'chair', 'moves', 'provided', 'nice', 'stretches', 'thighs', 'glutes', 'one', 'point', 'Kathy', 'perform', 'squat', 'stretch', 'opposite', 'side', 'when', 'were', 'felt', 'thoroughly', 'stretched.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'video', 'Tae', 'Bo', ""'ve"", 'never', 'tried', 'workouts', 'However', 'CAN', 'say', 'was', 'fun', 'high-energy', 'video', 'left', 'feeling', 'strong', 'powerful', 'rather', 'exhausted', 'was', 'perfect', 'kickboxing', 'beginner', 'was', 'also', 'challenging', 'enough', 'provide', 'even', 'non-beginners', 'great', 'workout', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'nice', 'easygoing', 'style', 'good', 'overall', 'instruction', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'thought', 'failed', 'adequately', 'cue', 'change', 'movement', 'workout', 'was', 'so', 'easy', 'follow', 'along', 'was', ""n't"", 'hard', 'replicate', 'movements', 'first', 'repetition', 'two', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'have', 'finally', 'found', 'cardio', 'video', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'look', 'forward', 'doing', 'video', 'part', 'regular', 'rotation']",N/A

I wanted a video that would be most affective when it came to reshaping my body, so when I have read that this guy who's featured with Kathy in the video cover was a champion martial artist, I thought this might be a great video to buy.

Now, I know that this was Kathy's video, but I was hoping that the guy would talk more than Kathy did, and take over more of the workout routines.  I have nothing against Kathy, but she seemed like she looked little confushed at times (had blank look on her face), and she kind of moved slower then I liked.  I was hoping that this video would be more like Billy Banks Taebo video, but less repetitve and hoped that it would contain more variety of moves.  But, the moves that Kathy did in this video was more water downed version of Billy's video, and she moved lot slower and was more repeptive.  Also, the guy look like he was better at this then Kathy.  He just moved more naturally and more gracefully then Kathy did.  He also seemed more knowledgeable about this kind of exercises then Kathy.  He also made more proper body alignments when working out then Kathy.

1866,A2TMQJD6VMSFHM,0738920525,"Kat Ramone ""katramone""","[6, 9]","I used to box and do karate when I was younger; however, it has been a while!  I wanted to add variety to my aerobic workouts and decided to try this workout.  I keep up a reasonably strenuous workout routine, and I am always seeking new routines to ""mix it up.""  This is really my fave aerobic workout, and I would do it everyday, but obviously, it would become too easy, boring, and ineffective, so I work it in twice-a-week, which keeps up the challenge and is quite effective for cardio, muscle-tone and endurance.  I am really not into ""high impact"" aerobics, and when I do ""high impact,"" it is probably about twenty minute's worth.  When I first did this video, I could complete only half the routine!  As I continued, I have worked up to the ""Advanced"" workout, complete it, and feel like I really worked out well!  If done correctly, one can really tighten and tone one's hips and thighs, and really learn to effectively ""kick"" should one so desire. Now, I do not know if this tape would be appropriate for those who are beginners or advanced...it may be too difficult for beginners, yet something which to work towards, and ""kickboxers"" may find this routine rather mundane.  For the regular and advanced exerciser, however, I would certainly consider this routine challenging.  The setting is in a boxing ring.  To Kathy's left, is martial arts expert, Keith Cooke, and to her right, a somewhat well-known and well respected Australian fitness instructor/trainer, Keli Roberts (she appears in a Cher workout and has some videos of her own on the market).  I was a bit surprised by her rather boyish ""redhead helmet hair style,"" which is probably why I did not recognize her, but that is not an issue--I was just surprised at how different she looked.  There are others working out the routine behind them.  I have the DVD version, so one may accomodate the workout to one's level and so on, but basically, the routine and moves consist of typical ""boxing"" moves with the arms (punches, upper cuts, hooks, jabs...), ""boxer's shuffle,""  and kick boxing moves with the arms and legs (elbow strikes, knee blocks, side kicks, round kicks...).  Of course, this is put into a whole patterned routine, with Kathy (unfortunately) leading the group, but as said, it is still a very good workout.  Keith Cooke is an excellent martial arts champion, and I have seen him in ""action.""  While there is a ""learn the moves"" segment, and picture-in-picture of Keith explaining how to properly maneuver and excecute some particular moves (as well as Keith doing the longer Tai Chi and Challenge Routine segments), the focus is really on Kathy.  She executes the moves okay and has truly become more adept with her exercise variety since her ""Aerobox"" workout in which she is quite clumsy and sloppy, but Keith C. is excellent, and I would quite frankly rather have seen more of him doing the moves or at least leading the group!  Kathy Smith introduces Keli as a person who has been kickboxing ""for about five years or so,""  but Keli is much more, and while Keli can obviously execute the moves, she really does not quite perform as Keith suggests they are to be done.  If one notices, Keli often leans back when executing the kicks, and brings her arms out to and from the sides when performing the punches, which is basically how Keith suggests NOT to execute the moves!  Personally, however, I would never tell Keli this to her face, and she does manage to have her own style.  There also seems to be a bit of ""competition"" going on with Keli on Kathy's part.  Perhaps it is because Keli appears to be one of the few women who is actually as tall or taller than Kathy, since Kathy always seems to tower over all of her fellow exerciser's.  I have noticed in many of her routines, she will get ""close"" or ""next"" to her workout partners, but in one side kick routine, she goes right in front of Keli for most of the kicks to her right, which kind of conveys, ""Hey!  I can kick as high as you!""  At the end of the workout, Keli and Keith each perform a brief combo routine to follow, and when Keli does hers, Kathy makes some type of silly move with her wrist before ""following"" along, and when it's Keith's turn, Kathy says, ""Let's do something a bit more complicated...""  Personally, I did not find Keith's routine THAT much more complicated!  She also makes an apparent ""dig"" toward Keli during the ""Thighs and Buns Drills,"" which is done while supporting oneself using a chair (and to further Kathy's ""lala-ness"", she manages to interrupt Keith after ASKING him how to execute the proper kicking form) when performing the kicks and she's behind Keli, Kathy states, ""You can put your weight on the chair...BUT DON'T PUT TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON THE CHAIR!""  Keli makes a kind of ""Face"" after the comment, but these are the little intricacies/annoyances one notices after doing the routine several times!  So, while there is quite a bit of instruction, and yes, Keith Cooke is featured, it is Kathy's show.  There is a ""Behind the Scenes"" segment in which Kathy does spend almost fifteen minutes interviewing Keith Cooke, which is very good, because as stated, he really is an excellent martial artist and interesting individual; however, if one watches Kathy's facial expressions as she's asking him questions and ""listening"" to him, she seems to be a bit ""spaced out,"" or in ""la la land.""  All that aside, overall this is a very good workout routine.  If you are a beginner, do not expect to get through it the first time; if you are into kickboxing or strenuous aerobics this might be too simple; for the rest of us, intermediate in aerobics, who are up to the challenge of a more strenuous routine to add at least a few times a week, this workout is perfect.  It is an excellent accompaniment to one's aerobic library that provides variety and effectiveness in one's routine.",4,"Effective, Fun Workout, Great to Add to One's Routine, Kathy Not So

1867,AISSRJ7E2L375,0738920525,"Kelly Garbato ""Marchpane!""","[4, 4]","I picked up a copy of Kathy Smith's Kickboxing Workout on DVD a few months ago. Though I used to do Tae Bo religiously, my cardio routine fell by the wayside when we moved into a new house and [insert excuse after excuse here; reason #1 being that our new home has all-concrete floors and it took us a few months to outfit the gym with an appropriate mat]. Anyway, when I vowed to start back up again, I quickly decided against resuming Tae Bo. What with its quick switches between moves, sometimes confusing instructions, and uneven editing, I suspect that Tae Bo was a little too rough on my knees and ankles. Instead, I thought I might check out Kathy Smith's workout; I have some of her other videos, including a few light weight workouts, and enjoy them...well, as much as one can enjoy an exercise DVD.Kathy Smith's Kickboxing Workout is just what I needed - an excellent workout for beginners. If you're new to cardio and/or kickboxing, the 45-minute Basic workout is challenging but not impossibly so. Smith starts with a slow warm up, leads you into a moderately-paced workout (roughly 20 minutes in length), and then cools things down with a short ""buns and thighs kicking drills"" segment, followed by a ""cool down stretch"" and an ""abs and back strengthening"" workout. The run time is just over 45 minutes. I have a few minor quibbles - for example, switching or adding moves in the middle of a routine, which seems to me a no-no for beginners - but nothing out of the ordinary. Overall, it's great.If you're expecting a more difficult routine from the 55-minute Challenge workout, forget it. Instead of putting together an entirely new routine for more experienced students - which is what I expected - Smith just adds two extra segments to the Basic workout and calls it a ""Challenge."" Keith Cooke leads the added ten minutes of footage, which is divided into two segments: ""Kickboxing Stances"" (a review of the postures, which can hardly be called ""challenging"") and ""Challenge"" (a few new combinations, again not super-difficult or especially intense). As much as I love the Basic workout, I'm super-disappointed in the Challenge; whereas I thought this might be a new routine I could move onto once I'd mastered the Basic workout, it's really just more of the same. Increased difficulty isn't just about endurance, but intensity too.  4/5 stars, with a point lost for the ""Challenge"" half of this DVD.Also, can the class please stop wearing baggy pants?

A variety of different punches and kicks are incorporated into cardio routines that get the heart rate up and make you feel invincible!  I like how Kathy starts out by discussing safety with martial arts expert Keith Cooke.  One important she and Keith stress throughout the workout is go at your own pace and not worry about kicking high or punching super hard.After the 10 minute warm-up, Kathy goes into a high-energy 25-minute workout.  I like how she introduces the leg work (e.g. pivots) before she introduces the punches, focusing on good form. She also doesn't go straight into kicking (she does &quot;side folds&quot; to prepare you for the kicks).  Throughout the tape you see clips of Keith doing the kicks and punches from different angles to help have good form.  As a bonus, the tape includes thigh and buns kicking drills and back and abs stability exercises.When I first started doing the workout, I felt that she didn't cue on time and would announce a new adjustment after she started doing it.  However, after doing the workout a couple of times, I knew what to expect so it wasn't as much of an issue.  I find the workout highly addictive and the time flies by really quickly.

She is wonderful at cueing and starts each punch and kick series very slowly so you can learn the moves.  You will feel this workout, and best of all, you should see results.Following the basic cardio section is a special buns section.  You will need a chair (or something else to support yourself with) to do this and YOU WILL DEFINITELY feel it!! Basically you do some lunges and many kicks to improve form, strengthen and work those legs... this is a very effective section.  Next, you learn some kickboxing stances that are HARD!!! This really works your legs (strengthens and stretches). It is much harder than it looks!!Then, the instructor will walk you through a series of challenging kickboxing routines.

1880,A3NDEZDFXPSBKE,0738920525,"The Dog Ate My Homework ""the_dog_ate_my_homework""","[5, 5]","I sort of fell upon this video by Smith on accident while browsing the library shelves for a yoga fix.  I like Tae Bo, and so I thought I would check this one out for a change of pace.  (I like Billy Blanks a lot, but some days I just need to spend time with other people.  Hee hee.)  I enjoyed the video a lot, so I bought the DVD.I think the DVD is a lot better than the video.  You can correct me if I am wrong, but the DVD has a lot of extra goodies on it that I do not recall seeing on the video.  Some of the extra goodies include a 15-minute Tai Chi workout with Kelly (the red-haired woman) and a few basic martial arts lessons with Keith Cooke (also approximately 15 minutes).  I do not find it as challenging as the Tae Bo ""Get Ripped"" workouts, but it still does its job extremely well and I enjoy it very much.Just keep in mind that this workout is in no way any kind of lesson in self-defense.  This is a kickboxing workout.  It is not a tutorial in streetfighting any more than a boot-camp workout would be a tutorial in how to fight in a combat zone.=)",5,I like the DVD,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,1067,"['sort', 'fell', 'video', 'Smith', 'accident', 'browsing', 'library', 'shelves', 'yoga', 'fix', 'like', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'so', 'thought', 'would', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'change', 'pace', 'like', 'Billy', 'Blanks', 'lot', 'days', 'just', 'need', 'spend', 'time', 'other', 'people', 'Hee', 'hee', 'enjoyed', 'video', 'lot', 'bought', 'DVD.I', 'think', 'DVD', 'lot', 'better', 'video', 'can', 'correct', 'am', 'wrong', 'DVD', 'lot', 'extra', 'goodies', 'do', 'not', 'recall', 'seeing', 'video', 'extra', 'goodies', 'include', '15-minute', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'Kelly', 'red-haired', 'woman', 'few', 'basic', 'martial', 'arts', 'lessons', 'Keith', 'Cooke', 'also', 'approximately', '15', 'minutes', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'as', 'challenging', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'Get', 'Ripped', 'workouts', 'still', 'job', 'extremely', 'well', 'enjoy', 'very', 'much.Just', 'keep', 'mind', 'workout', 'way', 'kind', 'lesson', 'self-defense', 'kickboxing', 'workout', 'not', 'tutorial', 'streetfighting', 'more', 'boot-camp', 'workout', 'would', 'be', 'tutorial', 'how', 'fight', 'combat', 'zone.=']",N/A

One of the things I really like about this video is the length of each routine.  Kathy gives you enough time to learn the moves, then practice the move, which lessens the risk of injuring yourself.  Beginners might find this video hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's a lot of fun!  And it's great cardio exercise! This video is definitely heads above the Tae-Bo series which goes at a very fast pace and doesn't allow you time to learn what you are doing.  Kathy Smith always does a great job researching whatever exercise genre she is working in and her choreography is very good.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes cardio kickboxing and wants a good workout.",4,Great cardio workout!,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,769,"['thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'video', 'easy', 'follow', 'very', 'good', 'workout', 'One', 'things', 'really', 'like', 'video', 'length', 'routine', 'Kathy', 'enough', 'time', 'learn', 'moves', 'then', 'practice', 'move', 'risk', 'injuring', 'Beginners', 'might', 'find', 'video', 'hard', 'first', 'once', 'get', 'hang', 'lot', 'fun', 'great', 'cardio', 'exercise', 'video', 'definitely', 'heads', 'Tae-Bo', 'series', 'very', 'fast', 'pace', ""n't"", 'allow', 'time', 'learn', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'always', 'great', 'job', 'researching', 'exercise', 'genre', 'working', 'choreography', 'very', 'good', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'cardio', 'kickboxing', 'good', 'workout']",N/A
