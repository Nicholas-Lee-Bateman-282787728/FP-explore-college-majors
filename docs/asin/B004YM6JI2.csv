As such, I have seen the show's two main characters, Sam and Dean Winchester, face creatures ranging from demons to witches, from vampires to werewolves, from wraiths to tricksters, from roogaroos to angels, and SO much more. Needless to say, you would think with a show like this, especially one where the writers will only pull from legends that already exist, things would get old quickly. However, Supernatural has been running for seven seasons now, and each one has presented something new and exciting for viewers. This particular season presented a whole new breed of monster: the leviathon. And these monsters brought with them an entirely different set of rules.I must admit that while there were a lot of things to love about this season, including the new monsters, the classic monster-of-the-week episodes a la seasons 1 & 2, the brotherly bonding moments between Sam and Dean, and the classic Supernatural humor that fans have come to know and love, there were also a few things to dislike about this season. The main two things that I had issues with this season were the loss of beloved characters and the fact that the leviathons' constant hunt for the boys drive them to ditch the Impala for the vast majority of the season.Still, in spite of these two drawbacks, the show still managed to pull off another great season. And like they have always managed to do, they ended the season with a cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more.

1433547,A8E1J9IDU18V9,B004YM6JI2,Garth R. Mailman,"[2, 2]","Originally conceived to have a 5 year arc this series is still around in its eighth season. Although it began life as a buddy buddy brother roadtrip kind of show as the years have gone on it has become darker and more philosophical. Dean and Sam are beer swilling junk food gulping good old boys. Although they  rarely remove their shirts to show off, how they maintain those trim physiques given their diet and lifestyle is one of the show's mysteries along with the other imponderables: how they race around the countryside without getting any speeding tickets, fake all those FBI Passes and rarely get caught using them, keep hiding that arsenal of weapons, afford and maintain those immaculately pressed suits they wear when impersonating the FBI. Most at home in denim and plaid despite sleeping in those clothes in that speeding car they never seem to look rumpled or sweaty. At 6' 4' Sam does not buy those jeans off the rack. In one episode last Season Sam was shown shirtless performing a workout worthy of any bodybuilder.Given the sibling rivalry shown on screen one wonders what Jensen Ackles thinks of Jared Padalecki getting top billing in the show's credits. Although Dean is the older brother on screen and in real life having him call Sam who towers over him his little brother is amusing. Both grew up in Texas a state where guns are a way of life.

Gamble has been with 'Supernatural' from the beginning, and is responsible for writing some of the series' strongest episodes.  I agree that 'Supernatural' could have ended with the conclusion of its fifth season, but it didn't.  When shows age, they show signs of wear and tear.  As years go on, some seasons are weaker than others.  Look at 'Desperate Housewives,' 'Grey's Anatomy,' or any 'CSI' or 'Law and Order' show for the proof.  Blaming Sera Gamble is weak, and if Eric Kripke were still in charge people would be blaming him.  The show isn't as fresh because there's nothing fresh about it.  The actors and crew have been together for so long they're all family now.  Everyone is so overwhelmingly familiar with one another that the sense of newness and adventure seems to be gone.  I will say the show has lost the edge it once had but I still enjoy coming back week after week.I will say I was slightly disappointed with the season finale.  Am I the only one who thought it anti-climatic?  Also, I hope that Bobby is gone.  I love the character and the actor, but I hope the show does not fall prey to bringing him back just because he's a beloved recurring character.  Let him go.  His death and his ghost finally moving on should give the boys a renewed edge.

1433560,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B004YM6JI2,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","The first thing we have to say is that this season is slightly tricky. The previous ended on the take-over of the cosmos by a social-climbing angel, Castiel, who had eliminated all the archangels that could oppose him and had managed to fool Crowley and he had his last final words demanding everyone to get on their knees and obey their new God. That was drastic, that was horrible, that was un-human. And that couldn't last long.And it did not last long because Castiel, like all these angelic people do, always forgets that God always puts something evil in the middle of anything good. They forget about the apple. Everything was good in that Garden of Eden, except for a snake, an apple tree and an apple, though it probably was a fig tree and a fig. So why should Purgatory be different? And it was not. Actually Purgatory was invented to put away one complete failure of the creative power of God, that is to say his first living creature created for the vast water expanse that existed before he started creating his playthings. And that creature was Leviathan. Note God is never able to destroy his failures, to repair his mistakes. He can only hide them away, generally under the carpet. His husbandry is absolutely primitive.So Castiel opened the gates of Purgatory and swallowed all the millions of souls there, which made him super powerful, powerful enough to finish up the last archangel and to take over the whole universe, but he had forgotten he had also swallowed Leviathan who waited for its time and moment to come and then without any more ado decided to take over this strange angelic body-vessel in which it was trapped and then to manage that dumb ass of an angel into freeing him and for him to get the upper hand on the planet. Simple Dr Watson, simple, a real child's play. And that poor Castiel will have to repent for ever for his crimes and his dumbness.The dark black Leviathan was created in water before light even existed, by the way it is not in the first chapter of Genesis but later in the Old Testament coming up on the Biblical soup like the bad monster Anzu that had taken all waters prisoner in the Zoroastrian and Sumerian tradition some two or three thousand years before the Bible. So that monster is as black as night and it rots Castiel from the inside. Castiel turns black and starts feeling the call of the deep ocean and Castiel manages to obey, willy nilly, more nilly than willy, and he goes down into a lake and liberates Leviathan in the water that gets into all the pipes of the city and maybe beyond since that lake was a drinking water reserve. Dean and Sam can satisfy their sadness by picking Castiel trench-coat from the lake and keep it as a keepsake. But one thing is sure Death refuses to intervene. It is the responsibility of those who released that monstrosity to get rid of it, and hurry up that must be done by the end of this season.I am of course not going to follow the episodes. You have to work a little bit. Now the worst and most monstrous creature of God has been released onto the world we can go back to business as usual and run after various monsters of all types. For example an old  acquaintance of Sam's, when he was a young teenager and was more or less ten or something. He was starting to experiment with girls but he has never been very lucky with this female subspecies of the human species. He gets that from his mother I guess. This girl who is now a woman was already what she still is, a brain-sucker sucking brains directly from the live skulls of a living humans, at least if possible for the last part. But Sam is in love again and he remembers how he was nearly the victim of her mother and that it is this girl who killed the mother at the crucial moment of the brain ""surgery"". So when he discovers she has a son and it is for him that she killed he gets soft and accepts her promise never to kill again. He let her go. But Dean disagrees and what will happen? The punch line is fantastic and the punch hatred from Sam is enormous, though it will come later.You will like how Sam and Dean get in-between a married couple of ancient witches who have been living through centuries. But they love each pother so much that they are bored of love everyday and they set some mustard on their daily bread and start accusing each other of treachery and unfaithfulness, etc. And they start creating havoc in the place for fun and entertainment. But Dean is a genius and manages to bring them back together and Sam is a darling for all suffering sentimental creatures and he helps them by instinct. But if it were that simple it would not be funny. So in the end Sam and Dean are no longer the saviors but the potential victims of some curse that has to be smoothened up by their friends the witches, or is it only one? But which one is it?The dear Leviathan, the master of them all, is able to mutiply and the baby can enter any body they want, what's more the body becomes like a snake skin and they can change their looks on demand, back and forth. They are shape-shifters by profession, affiliation and confession. And what about if two of them were assuming the bodies, the looks and appearance, language and everything going along with these bodies of Dean and Sam? Embarrassing since these two clones could lead the police to them committing all kinds of crimes and that would be very embarrassing indeed. But luckily there is always a way out of a trap, provided you have the proper tools. And a little help from your friends. And it is Bobby, in his new lair, since his old Bobby's Salvage Yard has been torched down by the Leviathan or maybe some other demons, who finds how to destroy these Leviathan, at least the lower layers of them. Using a simple product anyone can find in a proper kitchen. And cut their heads off, but keep the head trapped away from the body otherwise it will go back onto its body.They will of course spend some time saving some mentalists from some vengeance coming from some lured customers. That will enable you to see under the table of the mentalist, and all her tools to make you believe your grandmother is taking a bath in the garden's bird-bathDean and Sam will also settle some accounts with the old Becky from the time of the pulp book serial and the first Prophet. She has always been a fan of Sam. Her Internet identity is Samlicker81, Sam is a licker, She wants to lick Sam, She wants to drink Sam's liquor and all that playing billiards with two holes and one cue, a real trouble shooter cue, and the number of balls can vary I guess from two to nine. And on the Internet she is responsible of a Wincest site meaning she believes Dean and Sam are ""morethantbrothers"" and yet she wants to marry Sam. So she has to drug him, with a devilish elixir she gets from a devil of her friends' and she will be surprised she has not been able to consummate anything, though she has to tie Sam up on the bed for him not to escape and she cannot even then manage to consummate. Funny, funny, funny, but tricky like hell to get Sam out of this rape story.But the best things cannot last for ever and in the fight against the main Leviathan, a certain Dick Roman, a multibillionaire who has been invaded by Leviathan who is trying to use the money of this personality to create a food empire that will transform humanity into game for hunting and various pleasures in the west part of the USA, cattle in the south and part of the Mississippi valley and laboratory testing animals to research and develop the perfect drugs to produce the three categories of human chattel they need. They find out that the master Leviathan and some around him are not really killed by the kitchen product we have already spoken of. Luckily for the suspense otherwise it would have been too simple. Unluckily Bobby gets shot by the master Leviathan and is at the door of death hesitating and trying to come back. In the end that battle cannot be won, except two minutes to give the ""boys"" a number code they will have to understand. And then he dies. At least that's what you are supposed to believe.They will then use a substitute, Frank or something like that, for Bobby whose number they find in Bobby's agenda or address book.By accident Dean attacks a certain God Chronos, the God of time who is some kind of vampire who kills to suck the red soul out of hid victims and thus be eternal. But he has the power to travel in time and Dean finds himself in 1944 with Elliot Ness mind you chasing after a monster that Dean has to bring back along with himself to the precise time and place where Sam is waiting. Complicated but funny and the trick is so simple after all. It is always very simple but they make it look as if you needed to have a 250 IQ to invent it. So all will be well and end well, as we knew it would, but after a lot of angst and suspense.The best encounter though is that with the tribe of the Amazons. Dean who is always easy on the female side of the world gets trapped by one. An Amazon gets pregnant instantly, delivers within 36 hours (in the film it is more like six hours) and the child at the end of the day will be a teenager and the following day a young woman. Of course these Amazons only deliver women, un-naturally. But the daughter has to do something before becoming a full-fledged member of the tribe: kill her father and cut his two hands and his two feet off while alive and then cut out the sign of the tribe in his chest while he is still conscious and losing his blood. That's what children are after all, nothing but giant bloodsuckers biting after the blood of their parents.We discover in the mean time Sam is afraid of clowns and yet a whole shebang of crimes happen in a daycare center for children entirely organized around and with clowns. Sam and these clowns are having a good time indeed. And yet the pervert who kills what and who the children draw is found out not to be a clown, far from it. Poor chap. How can one be that deranged! But luckily Dean and Sam are the guardian angels of the children.And the past is never very far away. A serial killer exorcised by Dean and Sam in the past is back to recapture his demon. How selfish and ungrateful some deranged people and perverts can be! You cannot trust anyone any more and the poor chap you help along the road turns into a biting venomous snake in no time when he feels comfy and warm on your chest.And you will find a small antique store full of mysteries and ancient objects that kill and make other people kill. That's a little bit a clich&eacute; from Dickens redressed in modern colors. I think too this one is quite close to Stephen King's ""Needful Things.""A new development appears at this moment that is going to make Sam completely crazy. Lucifer, who is locked up in his cage with Michael in the body-vessel of Adam, the half brother of Dean and Sam, has the power to get into Sam's mind and make him believe he is still down there, and then when this is solved he starts torturing him by preventing him from sleeping by all means. Guantanamo revisited, though he shouts ""Good Morning Vietnam"" all the time which seems to be coming from another film about the Vietnam War. I guess you all see which one. The one with a US military forces' radio anchorman to entertain the combat troops down there in Vietnam. This revisiting the past brings a new discovery. Castiel has lost his memory and is living like a nice husband with his girlfriend. Dean will have to drag him into curing Sam, which he can't do, but he can something else that liberates Sam of some kind of green demon. Dean and Sam are accused of having scratched the wall built a long time ago by Death and some angels between Sam's soul and his memory of Hell. That's why Lucifer can come up from the cesspool.Now and then they can use the help of a young hunter of Bobby's and Franck's stable, a certain Garth. But nothing very brilliant. Just entertainment. To exorcize a spirit you can only see when drunk is tricky. Frank's hideout has been attacked by the Leviathans and his hard drive has been stolen by Dick Roman. But there is a girl at his headquarters who can help break it and she can also help Dean and Sam. She cracks the hard drive but pretends to Dick Roman that there is nothing concerning Dean and Sam, the only thing Dick Roman is interested in. But on the side she manages to copy and export the whole hard drive of Dick Roman himself. Note he has memorized his pass code to enter his computer. Must some monsters be so proud and sure, vain and silly to believe their security is so good that they need not fear anyone?The last big development is the appearance of the ""word of God"", an engraved stone that Dick Roman wants, that Dean and Sam steal and have transcribed by the ""Prophet"" that comes all by himself on his own unconscious drive that he has to go and to go to the stone. That gives the recipe to get rid of master Leviathan which will get rid of all his clones. But Dick Roman manages to capture the Prophet and have the stone translated again under duress (the Prophet's mother is kidnapped and Dick Roman blackmails the Prophet, by the way a certain Tran, probably Vietnamese). Dean and Sam need several ingredients to make a powerful weapon against Leviathan. The blood of an Alpha, and there is only one left, an Alpha vampire, but also the blood of Crowley who is of course in-between Dean and Sam on one side and Dick Roman on the other. Dick Roman actually trust Crowley. At least Dean and Sam never do that mistake.The season ends up dramatically. The confrontation with Dick Roman will end up with the destruction of the master Leviathan, but his death sends Castiel and Dean back to where he Leviathan came from, Purgatory where all kinds of monsters are roaming. Good Morning Vietnam indeed. Sam is all alone at Dick Roman's headquarters that are under some menace to explode or self destroy. And just before this confrontation Dean and Sam has burned Bobby's silver flask to which he was attached and that Dean was using all the time. So Bobby is gone for good this time. And the Prophet Tran was taken away before the final destruction of the master Leviathan to a place no one knows.Suspense, suspense.This season though has left angels and archangels aside (easy for the latter since they are all dead except Michael who is in Hell with Lucifer). We are no longer dealing with a dominantly Biblical saga since Leviathan is not typically Biblical, far from it. The demons are plain demons, ghosts are plain ghosts, witches are plain witches. But at the same time we have lost a unifying thread that really keeps all episodes together. It has become looser in a way.On the other hand it has also become more socio-political. It denounces with maybe too much weight the danger of a consumer's society and the weapon that corn syrup represents against our health and well being. It also goes back to H.G. Wells' ""Time Machine"" saga in which the human race is transformed in pure chattel but with three main categories: game, cattle and lab-testing animals. The Morlocks are just as dark and horrible, but the Eloi are not all meek and passive and have been differentiated into three different types, slightly like in Brave New World where they are five from alpha to epsilon. That's a come-back which is maybe slightly schematic but that's the TV genre of the series that requires that schematic texture. No time to play too much on the psychology of the characters and of the masses.I will have to wait for the next season till October or so. Too bad. But Il will have plenty of time to suspend my pleasure.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Fascinatingly pleasurable tough slightly loose,1354579200,"12 4, 2012",2012,15661,"['first', 'thing', 'have', 'say',

1433572,AHR9GFUXXEHY0,B004YM6JI2,Jon Thompson,"[0, 0]","This is one of the best shows currently running for a couple of reasons:1. It is a well blended entertainment.(The characters are intelligent and have senses of humor, which allows them to lighten the tension, when needed, with a well placed quip, which also lets the audience know the characters are reacting to what's going on in pretty much the same way the viewer is. Great for pulling the audience even further into the story. But it is not, in any sense, self-parody. When the scary strikes, you take it seriously.)2. It never falls back on Scotty to save the day.(One thing that weakened the otherwise brilliant Star Trek series was that, after having gotten trapped in some dire situation and struggled through 80% of the episode trying to deal with it, in the last few minutes Scotty would always come up with some techno-babble based solution to the danger by routing the impulse engines through the tractor beam or whatever. Once, okay, I buy it. But do it every week and it merely becomes a plot resolution convenience that is expected, totally ruining any tension. Supernatural never depends on some convenient or coincidental solution to the problem. And the tension remains high due to the fact that they've already killed off major, continuing characters... Dad, Bobby, Rufus, Ellen, Jo, etc. etc. Every life is up for grabs each episode which makes it nail biting week after week.)If you've never watched this program, try the first few episodes of season one. If it doesn't grab your interest, then it isn't for you. But if it does, make room on your DVD shelf for the entire series, because this is a show you can watch over and over again and still enjoy.",5,Hang on and enjoy the wild ride,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,1675,"['one', 'best', 'shows', 'currently', 'running', 'couple', 'reasons:1', 'well', 'blended', 'entertainment', 'characters', 'are', 'intelligent', 'have', 'senses', 'humor', 'lighten', 'tension', 'when', 'needed', 'well', 'placed', 'quip', 'also', 'audience', 'know', 'characters', 'are', 'reacting', 'what', 'going', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'viewer', 'Great', 'pulling', 'audience', 'even', 'further', 'story', 'not', 'sense', 'self-parody', 'When', 'scary', 'strikes', 'take', '2', 'never', 'back', 'Scotty', 'save', 'day', 'One', 'thing', 'weakened', 'otherwise', 'brilliant', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'was', 'having', 'gotten', 'trapped', 'dire', 'situation', 'struggled', '80', '%', 'episode', 'trying', 'deal', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'Scotty', 'would', 'always', 'come', 'up', 'techno-babble', 'based', 'solution', 'danger', 'routing', 'impulse', 'engines', 'tractor', 'beam', 'Once', 'buy', 'do', 'week', 'merely', 'plot', 'resolution', 'convenience', 'expected', 'totally', 'ruining', 'tension', 'Supernatural', 'never', 'convenient', 'coincidental', 'solution', 'problem', 'tension', 'high', 'due', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'already', 'killed', 'off', 'major', 'continuing', 'characters', 'Dad', 'Bobby', 'Rufus', 'Ellen', 'Jo', 'etc', 'etc', 'life', 'up', 'grabs', 'episode', 'nail', 'biting', 'week', 'week', ""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'program', 'try', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', ""n't"", 'grab', 'interest', 'then', ""n't"", 'make', 'room', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'entire', 'series', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'still', 'enjoy']",N/A

And to be honest, alot of the really famous actors in Hollywood out there don't even hold a candle physically to many of the actors in this show.  Jensen and Jared are overwhelmingly talented as well as handsome in a good old fashioned 'manly' way.  They don't look effiminate, or metro, which seems to be haunting the beauty standards of the 'average' male actor these days.  Misha Collins is also very SEXY in that ""I actually look like a deep and complex guy"" way and Jim Beaver is the type of man who you wish your husband looked like when he's in his forties. Crowley's character is also very well acted, along with many of the other ensemble or guest starring actors/actresses.  This is a well done show!  And this is not coming from a overtly critical but hypocritical person. i tried acting and I couldn't do it good to save my life, just like many people who claim to be famous and talented in hollywood are: NOT TALENTED, and don't have the looks to make up for it!

However, for the record, I would just like potential viewers who have not been to Lilydale, to know that none of this was actually shot in Lilydale, nor was it an accurate portrayal of it.Yes, there were some similarities, so, I can see that whoever wrote this either did their homework or visited Lilydale at one time. Yes, there is a cafe, which is a bit smaller and not quite as upscale as the one presented here. And yes, there is a museum, which actually looks quite similar to the one in this episode.The biggest disappointment though, was the beginning scene, which showed Dean walking down a somewhat busy or populated street with signs hanging out in front of each shop. Lilydale is actually a small country type of town, with small country streets and houses the size of cottages, with only small wooden sign posts stuck in the ground in each front lawn with the person's name and talent written on them. No big signs or big streets here. Every porch has chairs, a table and notebook, for you to write your name down on it for an available reading time, unless you have an appointment, which can sometimes be made in advance online via email or phone.I don't know why I was excited to read about this episode, believing it would actually be shot in Lilydale because they never are really shoot in any of the places it says in the show. I learned that from the Dogs who turn into people episode, which was suppose to take place in Buffalo, NY, where I live, but it didn't. So, I should have known they wouldn't actually travel to Lilydale for this show, which would have been very cool. So, those interested in visiting Lilydale, please don't be let down by this episode.Also, this show portrayed Lilydale to be a community of fakes and dishonest people. While one person I have seen in Lilydale, left me somewhat skeptical, the rest were right on. The discussion of the Fox sisters was for the most part, the truth, but with different photos. But, even the psychics were aren't 100% accurate, aren't as obviously phony as this representation portrayed.This episode in itself was a great show like always. I just don't like the misrepresentation of Lilydale. I have been there many times and it looks and feels nothing like it was portrayed in this episode. Nor are most of the psychics and mediums fakes, like you are led to believe in this show. I once saw an amazing medium in lilydale, named Gretchen Clark. She has been in People magazine, interviewed on television and more. The information she gave me about my mom, was information no one could have known but my mother. Additionally, she mentioned about 10 dead relatives I've never met, which my father did verify as relatives. And no, I never ever gave her my last name or any other information.Honestly, for a show titled, ""Supernatural"" you would think they would be a bit more open-minded about Psychics. It's easier to believe in Vampire's, Satan,and little dead boys in lakes than a psychic, really? I can't tell anyone what to believe or not believe, but I can say that my experiences in visiting Lilydale have been honorable. I love Supernatural, but, this was a poor portrayal of what Lilydale is really like. The show in itself, was very entertaining though, as always. So, those of you interested in Lilydale, please do your own homework and formulate an opinion of it based on something other than this episode. Still my favorite show though.",4,Great Episode-Poor Representation of Lilydale (RE: Episode 7-The Mentalist),1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,3519,"['Supernatural', 'favorite', 'television', 'show', 'means', 'do', 'mean', 'put', 'down', 'way', 'However', 'record', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'potential', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'Lilydale', 'know', 'none', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', 'Lilydale', 'was', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'it.Yes', 'were', 'similarities', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'whoever', 'wrote', 'did', 'homework', 'visited', 'Lilydale', 'one', 'time', 'Yes', 'cafe', 'bit', 'smaller', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'upscale', 'one', 'presented', 'here', 'yes', 'museum', 'actually', 'quite', 'similar', 'one', 'episode.The', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'was', 'beginning', 'scene', 'showed', 'Dean', 'walking', 'down', 'somewhat', 'busy', 'populated', 'street', 'signs', 'hanging', 'out', 'front', 'shop', 'Lilydale', 'actually', 'small', 'country', 'type', 'town', 'small', 'country', 'streets', 'houses', 'size', 'cottages', 'only', 'small', 'wooden', 'sign', 'posts', 'stuck', 'ground', 'front', 'lawn', 'person', 'name', 'talent', 'written', 'big', 'signs', 'big', 'streets', 'here', 'Every', 'porch', 'chairs', 'table', 'notebook', 'write', 'name', 'down', 'available', 'reading', 'time', 'have', 'appointment', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'made', 'advance', 'online', 'email', 'phone.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'was', 'excited', 'read', 'episode', 'believing', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'shot', 'Lilydale', 'never', 'are', 'really', 'shoot', 'places', 'show', 'learned', 'Dogs', 'who', 'turn', 'people', 'episode', 'was', 'suppose', 'take', 'place', 'Buffalo', 'NY', 'where', 'live', 'did', ""n't"", 'So', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'would', ""n't"", 'actually', 'travel', 'Lilydale', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'cool', 'So', 'interested', 'visiting', 'Lilydale', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'let', 'down', 'episode.Also', 'show', 'portrayed', 'Lilydale', 'be', 'community', 'fakes', 'dishonest', 'people', 'one', 'person', 'have', 'seen', 'Lilydale', 'left', 'somewhat', 'skeptical', 'rest', 'were', 'right', 'discussion', 'Fox', 'sisters', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'truth', 'different', 'photos', 'even', 'psychics', 'were', 'are', ""n't"", '100', '%', 'accurate', 'are', ""n't"", 'obviously', 'phony', 'representation', 'portrayed.This', 'episode', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'always', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'misrepresentation', 'Lilydale', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'many', 'times', 'nothing', 'was', 'portrayed', 'episode', 'are', 'most', 'psychics', 'mediums', 'fakes', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'show', 'once', 'saw', 'amazing', 'medium', 'lilydale', 'named', 'Gretchen', 'Clark', 'been', 'People', 'magazine', 'interviewed', 'television', 'more', 'information', 'gave', 'mom', 'was', 'information', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'known', 'mother', 'Additionally', 'mentioned', 'about', '10', 'dead', 'relatives', ""'ve"", 'never', 'met', 'father', 'did', 'verify', 'relatives', 'never', 'ever', 'gave', 'last', 'name', 'other', 'information.Honestly', 'show', 'titled', 'Supernatural', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'open-minded', 'Psychics', 'easier', 'believe', 'Vampire', 'Satan', 'little', 'dead', 'boys', 'lakes', 'psychic', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anyone', 'what', 'believe', 'not', 'believe', 'can', 'say', 'experiences', 'visiting', 'Lilydale', 'have', 'been', 'honorable', 'love', 'Supernatural', 'was', 'poor', 'portrayal', 'what', 'Lilydale', 'really', 'like', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'though', 'always', 'So', 'interested', 'Lilydale', 'please', 'do', 'own', 'homework', 'formulate', 'opinion', 'based', 'something', 'other', 'episode', 'Still', 'favorite', 'show']",N/A

There is so much Castiel (Misha Collins) that one can stand and the seventh season's introduction of the Leviathan was a breath of fresh air, especially in the casting of James Patrick Stuart as ""Dick Roman,"" a force to be reckoned with.  This season also saw the departure of a cast member but it was well-handled, befitting the status of the character to the Supernatural mythology.As always, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padelecki are their usual superb selves, still needing to be recognized by the Emmy folks. Fans of the show will have to be content that they know real talent when they see it even when the nominating folks just don't get it.  Mark Shepard's frequent appearances as Crowley are also a pleasure to watch.  The season also boasts some great guest appearances by James Marsters and Charisma Carpenter (""Shut Up, Dr. Phil) and ""The X-Files"" Nicholas Lea (""Time after Time"").Speaking of the latter episode, one of the special features deals with the composing of the music for the landmark episode: an episode that has Dean working with Eliot Ness of ""The Untouchables"" fame.

After a rocky first season, Supernatural season 2 set the tone for the rest of the series: a powerful force with personal ties to the Winchesters that has to be dealt with is a formula that has spawned the series most successful seasons. Unfortunately, some fans feel that this blueprint should never change and because of that feel that this season was lacking. I am here to disagree.I have loved every season of Supernatural, but as the seasons passed I started to miss the lighter episodes that showcase why the boys are the best in the business; namely the monster of the week cases. The boys having to overcome personal struggles and stop the apocalypse is fantastic, but sometimes it gets too heavy. Season 7 did a nearly flawless job of combining the two.The constant threat of the Leviathan mencace was handled well without becoming over bearing. Sam and Dean still have to save the world, but also show their versatility as hunters. They take on everything from age old witches and ancient Egyptian dieties, to killer clowns and spirits that can only be seen while drunk. There are also plenty of heavier episodes with them dealing with the nearly unstoppable leviathans, creating a satifsfying balance.Season 2 still ranks as my favorite season, but this set is easily my second favorite. Season 7 is an entertaining, well balnaced season that has something for all fans. There doesn't have to be an apocalypse every season for it to be good, and season 7 proves that.",5,Bringing back the monster of the week,1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,1546,"['Supernatural', 'fans', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'most', 'quite', 'time', 'rocky', 'first', 'season', 'Supernatural', 'season', '2', 'set', 'tone', 'rest', 'series', 'powerful', 'force', 'personal', 'ties', 'Winchesters', 'be', 'dealt', 'formula', 'spawned', 'series', 'most', 'successful', 'seasons', 'Unfortunately', 'fans', 'feel', 'blueprint', 'should', 'never', 'change', 'feel', 'season', 'was', 'lacking', 'am', 'here', 'disagree.I', 'have', 'loved', 'season', 'Supernatural', 'seasons', 'passed', 'started', 'miss', 'lighter', 'episodes', 'showcase', 'why', 'boys', 'are', 'best', 'business', 'namely', 'monster', 'week', 'cases', 'boys', 'having', 'overcome', 'personal', 'struggles', 'stop', 'apocalypse', 'fantastic', 'too', 'heavy', 'Season', '7', 'did', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'job', 'combining', 'two.The', 'constant', 'threat', 'Leviathan', 'mencace', 'was', 'handled', 'well', 'becoming', 'over', 'bearing', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'still', 'have', 'save', 'world', 'also', 'show', 'versatility', 'hunters', 'take', 'everything', 'age', 'old', 'witches', 'ancient', 'Egyptian', 'dieties', 'killer', 'clowns', 'spirits', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'drunk', 'are', 'also', 'plenty', 'heavier', 'episodes', 'dealing', 'nearly', 'unstoppable', 'leviathans', 'creating', 'satifsfying', 'balance.Season', '2', 'still', 'favorite', 'season', 'set', 'easily', 'second', 'favorite', 'Season', '7', 'entertaining', 'well', 'balnaced', 'season', 'something', 'fans', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'apocalypse', 'season', 'be', 'good', 'season', '7', 'proves']",N/A

The first five seasons were terrific with a series of season long story arcs and a larger one that, had it ended with season five, would have made for a satisfying series (although some fans might not have been happy with Sam's fate originally).Season six which started with the return from Hell of Sam who was missing his soul  stumbled a bit as the series creator Eric Kripke left the show and the series searched for a new direction. The seventh season is more satisfying and more consistent than season six reaching close to the high points and their fight in the pit during seasons one through five.SPOILERS:Sam's looney tunes--he's lost his mind, or rather, his soul has been damaged from his possession by Satan in the pit. What's more Castiel in his battle with the other angels in Heaven for supremecy takes a dangerous path--making a deal with the Crowley. He's also absorbed the souls in Purgatory--the only problem is that he's also absorbed God's first creations--the Leviathans-- creatures that were so offensive to God that he banished them. At first Castiel BELIEVES he is now God but quickly discovers that he can't handle the souls of the Leviathans who escape and decide to make humanity into their version of Soylent Green. Dean, Sam and Bobby are the only ones who can stop them and, without Castiel, they quickly find themselves on the losing end of this battle.END OF SPOILERS:The Blu-ray for ""Supernatural"" looks marvelous. Blacks are as rich and gooey as the blood of the Leviathans. Colors looks quite nice and the show which always looked like grainy  film even though it is shot digitally and detail remains strong throughout. The AVC encode helps each episode look top notch.The lossless audio sounds marvelous with nice directional effects used throughout the series.The special features are quite good as well. We get three commentary tracks including ""Slash Fiction"" with our stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles who are their usual charming, chatty, funny selves.We also get the ""Supernatural Creature Fest Drive-In"" which has a number of terrific featurettes covering how the writers came up with the story arc for the seventh season, ""Highway to Death"" that compares what one of our characters sees when they die (as compared to what we've heard and read about in literature), ""Prosthetic Men"" focuses on the make up/creature effects and ""Trail of the Winchesters"" tells us everything we did (and didn't) want to know about Osiris.We also get ""Doppleganger's Ball"", ""Weekend at Lily Dale"" which focuses on the episode ""The Mentalists"" and what inspired the episode. ""Creatures from the Digital Realm"" shows us how the creatures were created for the season. We also get another episode of ""Jensen Sings"" as well as the season gag reel.There are a couple of Easter eggs in ""Supernaturla Creature Fest Drive-In"".
