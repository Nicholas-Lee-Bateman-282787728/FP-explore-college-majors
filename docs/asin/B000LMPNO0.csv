1039554,AJ83VFEY0MYLM,B000LMPNO0,"Ashley L. Oldaker ""SRK all the way""","[0, 0]","At the opening of this movie you hear 80's talk show music and see a group of clearly over-caffeinated friends gossiping about Raj and Priya's love story. The actors in this scene don't ring true to me, don't speak of their friends deep love or problems with sincerity or feeling. After this scene the movie is amazing. Shah Rukh's character (Raj) is extremely passionate with all the positive and negative aspects that come along with that quality. I do think his character is a little inconsistent. He goes so far out of his way for Priya when he wants to marry her, but after they get married he refuses to do even the simplest things that would mean a lot to her. Most men are like this in real life, but they don't set the bar as high in the beginning as Raj does. Rani is gorgeous and wonderful as always. She has such grace and a quiet dignity. She and Kajol are some of most beautiful actresses, up there with Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor. I love the songs but am very disappointed that there are no subtitles for the songs. I feel like I missed a lot because the movie shows their love story from the outside but the songs are about what's going on on the inside; their thoughts, feelings, and desires. The subtitles in general are horrible. Just about any word over four letters is misspelled and the grammar and wording is obviously from someone not comfortable with the English language. But the movie is enjoyable regardless. I absolutely love the scene with a pitiful Raj sobbing on his knees at the airport. The man just needs to be hugged! How can she possibly walk away from this sweet, beautiful man that is crying in public over her?! Shah Rukh Khan is a phenomenon.

It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage. One thing that stood out to me, which bothered me, was that the ""in-laws"" of Rani's character seemed prejudiced against Shah Rukh Khan's character. I believe that once a family member has married someone, the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new spouse. Most romantic films focus on the relationship up until marriage, with the idea that the couple will live ""Happily Ever After"". However, the reality is that relationships need to be cared for after marriage.

However, there was no other redeeming quality to ""Chalte Chalte"" than what I've mentioned above.The love story is unrealistic from the beginning. That's usually okay in a romantic comedy because the characters still somehow live happily ever after, but this movie showed me that these kinds of relationships don't really work out. Okay, so this movie is realistic...but that didn't make it entertaining. The couple only got together because the man kept pressuring the woman to accept his proposal, and after they married, they bickered most of the time, mainly because of the husband's insecurities.This might be the movie for you if you're trying to watch every Shah Rukh Khan movie out there.

Priya (played by Rani Mukerji) is upper-crust, Raj (Shahrukh Khan) is working class; she's polished, he's brash; and the two make an irresistible pair who can't resist each other, despite a mountain of obstacles. They find a way to be together, of course, and that's where most romantic movies end--but here, that's only the first half. After they wed, they come down from the high of their dramatic courtship and discover marriage isn't all wine and roses. In addition to major personality clashes--they can't stand the qualities they once loved in each other--their different social backgrounds become a growing problem, and when Raj's business runs into financial trouble and Priya tells a well-meaning lie to help him out, he stands to lose his wife and his livelihood. Mukerji and Khan--who are frequent co-stars--have never been more in sync as actors and never more convincing as lovers, whether they're making each other laugh, cry, yell, or swoon. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)",5,Must See,1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,1218,"['were', 'recipe', 'perfect', 'romantic', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'ingredients', 'are', 'mixed', 'just', 'so', 'result', 'feast', 'heady', 'imperfect', 'love', 'Priya', 'played', 'Rani', 'Mukerji', 'upper-crust', 'Raj', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'working', 'class', 'polished', 'brash', 'two', 'make', 'irresistible', 'pair', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'other', 'mountain', 'obstacles', 'find', 'way', 'be', 'together', 'course', 'where', 'most', 'romantic', 'movies', 'end', 'here', 'only', 'first', 'half', 'wed', 'come', 'down', 'high', 'dramatic', 'courtship', 'discover', 'marriage', ""n't"", 'wine', 'roses', 'addition', 'major', 'personality', 'clashes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'qualities', 'once', 'loved', 'other', 'different', 'social', 'become', 'growing', 'problem', 'when', 'Raj', 'business', 'financial', 'trouble', 'Priya', 'well-meaning', 'lie', 'help', 'out', 'lose', 'wife', 'livelihood', 'Mukerji', 'Khan', 'who', 'are', 'frequent', 'co-stars', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'sync', 'actors', 'never', 'more', 'convincing', 'lovers', ""'re"", 'making', 'other', 'laugh', 'cry', 'yell', 'swoon', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket', 'American', 'guide', 'Indian', 'movies', 'Subscribe', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket']",N/A

1039561,A9T0DBHRUV2N7,B000LMPNO0,Lee Jilek,"[6, 7]","Having reviewed a few movies for Amazon.com, I thought I knew something.  I DO NOT!  I started watching Chalte Chalte as a critic-wanna-be, not as a viewer.  Although there are some genuinely sweet and funny scenes in the first half of this film, I saw no reason to have two high-powered actors (Khan and Rani) in what initially looks like a well done but kinda milk-toast production. The first half of the film is the fantasy of falling in love and getting married. Then I got hooked. The second half is the reality of marriage and learning to live together.  Where there is love there is passion and sometimes fire!Khan turns in the acting performance of a life time in the second half of the film.  At one point I was so mad at his character that I wanted to slap the snot out of him. Priya (Rani) delivers the much needed slap at just the right moment.  Unlike some scenes in Hindi films where combatants miss by 5 inches it really looks like Rani lets him have one (in slow-mo, not really) keeping the scene real.Rani is her usual perfect self (Who wouldn't love her?) and the supporting actors are excellent throughout the story - acting 5.  Although the music and dance scenes are good and integrated well in to the film, they are not (in my opinion) big-time productions leaving the urge to watch over and over such as in movies like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Bunti Aur Babli and Dhoom 2 - so 4. The story doesn't seem that unique but it is told well so - a 3, maybe.  It pains me to give this movie an overall 4 given the excellent performances of Khan, Rani and others so I give it a 5 anyway.",5,Khaned again?,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,1597,"['Having', 'reviewed', 'few', 'movies', 'Amazon.com', 'thought', 'knew', 'something', 'DO', 'NOT', 'started', 'watching', 'Chalte', 'Chalte', 'critic-wanna-be', 'not', 'viewer', 'are', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'funny', 'scenes', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'saw', 'reason', 'have', 'two', 'high-powered', 'actors', 'Khan', 'Rani', 'what', 'initially', 'well', 'done', 'kinda', 'milk-toast', 'production', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'fantasy', 'falling', 'love', 'getting', 'married', 'Then', 'got', 'hooked', 'second', 'half', 'reality', 'marriage', 'learning', 'live', 'together', 'Where', 'love', 'passion', 'sometimes', 'fire', 'Khan', 'acting', 'performance', 'life', 'time', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'so', 'mad', 'character', 'wanted', 'slap', 'snot', 'Priya', 'Rani', 'much', 'needed', 'slap', 'just', 'right', 'moment', 'scenes', 'Hindi', 'films', 'where', 'combatants', 'miss', '5', 'inches', 'really', 'Rani', 'have', 'one', 'slow-mo', 'not', 'really', 'keeping', 'scene', 'real.Rani', 'usual', 'perfect', 'self', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'love', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'story', 'acting', '5', 'music', 'dance', 'scenes', 'are', 'good', 'integrated', 'well', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'opinion', 'big-time', 'productions', 'leaving', 'urge', 'watch', 'over', 'such', 'movies', 'Kuch', 'Kuch', 'Hota', 'Hai', 'Bunti', 'Aur', 'Babli', 'Dhoom', '2', 'so', '4', 'story', ""n't"", 'seem', 'unique', 'told', 'well', 'so', '3', 'maybe', 'give', 'movie', 'overall', '4', 'given', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Khan', 'Rani', 'others', 'so', 'give', '5', 'anyway']",N/A

1039566,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B000LMPNO0,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[1, 1]","Where has it ever been wrong when Shah Rukh Khan and Rani Mukerji star together as a couple trying to work things out?They meet by accident, argue with each other for a while, start to like each other, marry, then they continue their original natural behaviors, they get complacent with each other in their marriage, and then eventually grow apart from each other.  Rani Mukherji's role shows her as more serious about her career and her future, but Shah Rukh Khan's role shows him more nonchalant and maybe even a little bit lazy, and therefore, the relationship continues on a sour note.As far as the story goes, there is very little surprise here.  I only really appreciate it more than many Bollywood films because, for once, I think the songs videos are more enjoyable than the movie itself.But, I generally watch Bollywood films because I love to watch good looking people on film.  A good story is only secondary as my main intention is to be entertained.If you an English speaking American, and are new to Bollywood films, let me give you a breakdown of how I interpret and ingest the Bollywood experience:First of all, you will most always be reading English subtitles.The average Bollywood film is about 3 hours long.Bollywood films are very colorful.  All their beautiful fashion, and colorful dance floors. In High Definition, just the sceneries alone make you appreciate what High Definition is all about.About 30 percent of the film will be music videos (with Yash Raj films, it's more like about 45 percent). I personally wish there were less music videos if the movie is already over three hours long.About 30 percent of most Bollywood films have some rather silly, really unfunny, and downright annoying comedy scenes (which is usually in the first half of the film), then the film will start to become more serious, as it moves along.One of the main reasons why you will watch a Bollywood film, is because you already chose to fall in love with one of their many beautiful actresses, or handsome actors. (I personally try to see all Rani Mukherji films, and Shah Rukh Khan is the one actor known to be one of the biggest box office sellers of Bollywood.)So, I guess I can honestly say that I have about 10 Blu-Ray Bollywood films which about 7 of them are Yash Raj releases. Though I have about 100 Bollywood films on DVD, all I really care to get on Blu-Ray now is ""Lagaan"" which was the first Bollywood film that I saw about 10 years ago.  And perhaps ""Mann"" with Aamir Khan, and ""Rangeela"" which stars the enchanting Urmila Matondkar.  Oh, and I guess it would be truly appreciated if ""Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai"" starring Amisha Patel and Hrithik Roshan would ever be released in High Definition Blu-Ray.  The scenes in India and New Zealand were all just so beautiful on the screen.Another good movie that I would like to recommend, that is not a Yash Raj film, but is available on Blu-Ray is ""Ghulam"" starring Rani Mukherji and Aamir Khan.  Even all the song videos in this film are all truly appreciated, and the added humor isn't so annoying.

I think my least favorite so far is King Uncle or phir bhi bhi dil hai hindustani. But have enjoyed all the films I have seen so far by mr Khan. He is such an amazing, talented, charismatic actor.
