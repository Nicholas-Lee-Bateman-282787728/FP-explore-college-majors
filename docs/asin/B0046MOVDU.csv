1387851,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B0046MOVDU,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[24, 26]","A BBC story outrageously funny. Strong casting, plenty of Brit stars, with twists that keep you watching like a Midsomer Murder. But it is a Martin Clunes, before his superlative Doc Martin series, that pulls the dirty tricks. How can this DVD be compared to that super-level of comedy in Doc Martin? Close, but not quite.Clunes, as Edward, begins the tale explaining to viewers he is avoiding CID Moss (James Bolam-yes, `the' Beiderbecke) and heading out of the country to avoid arrest for a double murder. Moss investigates just like in the Beiderbecke series. Edward didn't do it, he says. It's technically true, and he begins the explanation from 2 years previous.A crazed adulteress, Karen (Julie Graham-`Bonekickers' see it), tags Edward as her unlikely victim and begins numerous assaults to his person using every room of her home, but only when her hubby, CPA Dennis (Neil Dudgeon), is nearby. Kinky? The tan-less skin, vocabulary, and graphic activity is overdone, but there was a warning on the box. Get by the overexposure and the plot gets comic.There are some unfortunate accidents, resulting in death, but also financial opportunity for others. Thus, the plot to twist the truth into a profitable outcome turns up the hilarity. Another female, twists the mix, using Lindsay Duncan (Under the Tuscan Sun; Rector's Wife) as Edwards new flame as he tries to put the loss of his first love onto innocent Clive, well not so innocent in all things.Strangely, found the musical score quite appropriate and nice. Some great visuals of England and Wales. The drama is based on a Michael Dibdin book. Writing caused it to get the Int. Emmy win. Martin Clunes has soared upward in comedy excellence since this 2000 role. Perhaps he's as good playing Edward, as he is playing Dr Martin. He did a very good job as Edward playing a bad actor trying to avoid a murder trial. Perhaps it's just the level he has obtained in current TV episodes that makes this DVD seem less. Bottom line, even with the overworked lust angle, the 2 episode show brings on laughs out loud.SUBTITLES included.
