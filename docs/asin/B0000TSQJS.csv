This movie was boring, depressing and straight up distasteful. I felt like all the characters were trashy with the exception of Mabius. In fact, Mabius was the only good part of the movie, purely because he is nice to look at! For an assassin, I thought Hannah's character was really fragile, submissive and timid, making it hard to believe her as a cold blooded assassin. Also, I can't really picture why a good looking x-priest would go for such a trashy looking drunk woman in a bar and then proceed to practically stalk her.

783567,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B0000TSQJS,Jonathan Appleseed,"[7, 10]","There are several positives about this film. There are also some negatives, and the two balance each other out to a reasonable three star review.One gets a sense that the producers were aiming for something along the lines of Requiem for a Dream - a movie that had me contemplating the merits of suicide when I finished watching it (not really). The aim was definitely for such intense depravity that the viewer would be sucked into horrid despair.Daryl Hannah (C.J.) put in a credible performance of a hit woman ""gone soft"". It's unlikely that she would have been in such a state if her mark weren't a husband and his pregnant wife while she was pregnant herself. There we have a positive and a negative combined. Terrific, persuasive performance, tainted by a ""just so happens"" type of circumstance. That's clumsy writing.I enjoyed the flashbacks to C.J.'s childhood. We often see hardened characters on the screen without any understanding as to what steeled them. Here we know - and this explanation is not tainted. It's rather sad and moving.Initially I thought that the introduction of a former priest (Eric Mabius as Rick) to the production was rather cheap and on the cheesy side. Why in the world would someone so wholesome and pure be so interested in such damaged goods? The answer is rather simple. He was a former priest. You can leave the frock behind, but you can't leave the desire to save people behind. He recognized someone in desperate need of salvation and refused to let go. One imagines, and must forgive, that there was an obvious physical attraction on his part; otherwise, he would not have been so interested. Still, it wasn't as unbelievable as I initially thought.Brad Renfro, who is unfortunately losing his hair and his boyish good looks, is still a good actor, and demonstrates believably that he is a man trying to do good by his wife, who, on top of being a reformed hooker, is also self-absorbed. For example, when he comes back to the motel with a gunshot wound, her first question is, ""Did you sell it?"" That was, of course, in reference to the drugs. She didn't care about his physical well-being.As with any movie fueled at least partly by action sequences, there were some rather unbelievable sequences. Could a woman who JUST gave birth to a baby really leave that baby lying on the table (is she truly that evil or selfish?) and run, full speed, trying to escape death? I'm not a doctor, and I don't play one on TV, but I would imagine that after giving birth - a difficult birth - that such physical activities would have been improbably, if not impossible.The ending is rather puzzling. There is a climax, and a d&eacute;nouement. I had questions regarding both. Mainly, people shot in the stomach usually aren't capable of hauling themselves halfway across town. Stomach wounds are supposed to be considerably painful. Concerning the d&eacute;nouement, I'll say two things: she was shot in the stomach (so how did she...??) and Rick was absent. Not only was there another physical improbability, the film didn't wrap things up as well as it could have. I suppose that if Rick were present, one could argue that the ending was cheesy, but he was a savior figure. Saviors usually see things all the way through.",3,Reasonable attempt at depicting depravity,1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,3254,"['are', 'several', 'positives', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'negatives', 'two', 'balance', 'other', 'reasonable', 'three', 'star', 'review.One', 'sense', 'producers', 'were', 'aiming', 'something', 'lines', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'movie', 'had', 'contemplating', 'merits', 'suicide', 'when', 'finished', 'watching', 'not', 'really', 'aim', 'was', 'definitely', 'such', 'intense', 'depravity', 'viewer', 'would', 'be', 'sucked', 'horrid', 'despair.Daryl', 'Hannah', 'C.J', 'put', 'credible', 'performance', 'hit', 'woman', 'gone', 'soft', 'unlikely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'such', 'state', 'mark', 'were', ""n't"", 'husband', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'was', 'pregnant', 'have', 'positive', 'negative', 'combined', 'Terrific', 'persuasive', 'performance', 'tainted', 'just', 'so', 'happens', 'type', 'circumstance', 'clumsy', 'writing.I', 'enjoyed', 'flashbacks', 'C.J', 'childhood', 'often', 'see', 'hardened', 'characters', 'screen', 'understanding', 'what', 'steeled', 'Here', 'know', 'explanation', 'not', 'tainted', 'rather', 'sad', 'moving.Initially', 'thought', 'introduction', 'former', 'priest', 'Eric', 'Mabius', 'Rick', 'production', 'was', 'rather', 'cheap', 'cheesy', 'side', 'Why', 'world', 'would', 'someone', 'so', 'wholesome', 'pure', 'be', 'so', 'interested', 'such', 'damaged', 'goods', 'answer', 'rather', 'simple', 'was', 'former', 'priest', 'can', 'leave', 'frock', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'desire', 'save', 'people', 'recognized', 'someone', 'desperate', 'need', 'salvation', 'refused', 'let', 'go', 'One', 'imagines', 'must', 'forgive', 'was', 'obvious', 'physical', 'attraction', 'part', 'otherwise', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'interested', 'Still', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'unbelievable', 'initially', 'thought.Brad', 'Renfro', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'losing', 'hair', 'boyish', 'good', 'looks', 'still', 'good', 'actor', 'believably', 'man', 'trying', 'do', 'good', 'wife', 'who', 'top', 'being', 'reformed', 'hooker', 'also', 'self-absorbed', 'example', 'when', 'back', 'motel', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'first', 'question', 'Did', 'sell', 'was', 'course', 'reference', 'drugs', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'physical', 'well-being.As', 'movie', 'fueled', 'least', 'partly', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'rather', 'unbelievable', 'sequences', 'Could', 'woman', 'who', 'JUST', 'gave', 'birth', 'baby', 'really', 'leave', 'baby', 'lying', 'table', 'truly', 'evil', 'selfish', 'run', 'full', 'speed', 'trying', 'escape', 'death', ""'m"", 'not', 'doctor', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'one', 'TV', 'would', 'imagine', 'giving', 'birth', 'difficult', 'birth', 'such', 'physical', 'activities', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'improbably', 'not', 'impossible.The', 'ending', 'rather', 'puzzling', 'climax', 'd', 'eacute', 'nouement', 'had', 'questions', 'regarding', 'Mainly', 'people', 'shot', 'stomach', 'usually', 'are', ""n't"", 'capable', 'hauling', 'halfway', 'town', 'Stomach', 'wounds', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'considerably', 'painful', 'Concerning', 'd', 'eacute', 'nouement', ""'ll"", 'say', 'two', 'things', 'was', 'shot', 'stomach', 'how', 'did', 'Rick', 'was', 'absent', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'there', 'physical', 'improbability', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'suppose', 'Rick', 'were', 'present', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'ending', 'was', 'cheesy', 'was', 'savior', 'figure', 'Saviors', 'usually', 'see', 'things', 'way']",The Job

Daryl Hannah (Splash, Kill Bill films), Brad Renfro (1982-2008), Dominique Swain (Face/Off,Dead Mary), Eric Mabius (Ugly Betty), and Alex Rocco, deliver some decent performances.  The problem lies mostly with writer/director Kenny Golde's screenplay, which attempts to be suspenseful and also sensitive, but instead mostly comes off as pretentiously cliched, and sloppy.Hired killer CJ March (Hannah) murders a man, but fails to recover a shipment of drugs for her employer Vernon Cray (Rocco).  March gets on the trail of a drug dealer she believes has the shipment, but looking for some quick cash, a small time crook named Troy (Renfro), and his pregnant girlfriend Emily (Swain), murder the dealer, and make off with a large stash of heroin.March's life is further complicated because she is pregnant, and is contemplating an abortion.  She also has just become romantically involved with Rick (Mabius), a former priest.  Troy and Emily are in hiding, but are having no luck in selling the drugs.  March easily tracks down the runaway couple, but resists killing them, until she has no options left.The Job aspires to be a fully fleshed out suspense thriller with some clever nuances, but fails pretty badly.  The burned out March displays little professional competence, and she pays with her blood more than once, for her poor judgment.  The attempts to explore some emotionally sensitive subjects is done rather clumsily, and an abortion attempt in a bathtub is quite pathetic.  The relationship between CJ and Rick seems forced, and Vernon Cray seems like a cartoon character.  In one of the few bright spots, Dominique Swain ""delivers"" an entertaining performance, as her character's survival instinct shifts into overdrive.It plays like a Lifetime movie, and the story is one huge clich&eacute;, but if you are a Prime member looking for a little low grade suspense, you might want to give The Job a chance.

Its not like he had been a ""prison priest"" with a working knowledge of how the psych worked, its like he was dropped onto the earth with no prior knowledge of life at all.  A clean cut little boy man who still believed in ""sins of the flesh"".  I found his character totally insipid.  The title of the movie bore true: it was just a job and the people with whom she dealt had the profound knowledge that their job was extremely dangerous and that they too may end up on the receiving end of the bullet. Easy as that. Its a violent movie, but more than just your typical crime drama. There was no good guys involved. There were no hero's. People's perception of the film is interesting too.  Maybe Hanna broke the stereotype of a weak woman.  The stereotype of a woman needing a man to save her: who is seeking some type of affirmation or moral redemption. It was a very unusual role she played. I'm glad about the ending, although I have a feeling the studio changed the ending to make it more palatable to the audience.This movie may not be for everyone, but I gave it a solid three stars.  If it wasn't for the Priest bit, I would have given it a four.  All the female actresses were fantastic.  Even the girlie-girl pregnant sociopath was good, I'll bet lots of viewers had sympathy for her!",3,The Job,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,1424,"['was', 'good', 'movie', 'plenty', 'action', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'Priest', 'bit', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'not', 'had', 'been', 'prison', 'priest', 'working', 'knowledge', 'how', 'psych', 'worked', 'was', 'dropped', 'earth', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'life', 'clean', 'cut', 'little', 'boy', 'man', 'who', 'still', 'believed', 'sins', 'flesh', 'found', 'character', 'totally', 'insipid', 'title', 'movie', 'bore', 'true', 'was', 'just', 'job', 'people', 'whom', 'dealt', 'had', 'profound', 'knowledge', 'job', 'was', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'too', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'receiving', 'end', 'bullet', 'Easy', 'violent', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'typical', 'crime', 'drama', 'was', 'good', 'guys', 'involved', 'were', 'hero', 'People', 'perception', 'film', 'interesting', 'too', 'Maybe', 'Hanna', 'broke', 'stereotype', 'weak', 'woman', 'stereotype', 'woman', 'needing', 'man', 'save', 'who', 'seeking', 'type', 'affirmation', 'moral', 'redemption', 'was', 'very', 'unusual', 'role', 'played', ""'m"", 'glad', 'ending', 'have', 'feeling', 'studio', 'changed', 'ending', 'make', 'more', 'palatable', 'audience.This', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'gave', 'solid', 'three', 'stars', 'was', ""n't"", 'Priest', 'bit', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'four', 'female', 'actresses', 'were', 'fantastic', 'Even', 'girlie-girl', 'pregnant', 'sociopath', 'was', 'good', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'lots', 'viewers', 'had', 'sympathy']",The Job
