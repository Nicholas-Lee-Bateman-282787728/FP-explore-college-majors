396299,A2J0MP2GPNHJHF,6304019610,"Claudio Di Gregorio ""ClauDG""","[0, 0]","Placed in Victorian India, this film is about the uncomfortable --often impossible-- coexistence of honour and hypocrisy, prudishness and debauchery.Endowed with a first rate international cast, acting is superb (though poor Suzanna York is forced to play a totally uncalled for and embarrassing scene of nervous breakdown, which looks as artificial as anything),The direction is ok, but not formidable. The realism of some --fortunately short-- outtakes is marred by blatant back projections (it is painfully obvious that actors never left the set).Dialogues are as fine as usual on well written plays, but in the end the explanation of the mystery seems strained and hardly believable to me. Characters act strangely: a guy acts brutally against adulterous women but keeps friendship with the lover of them. As the trial is supposed to be unauthorized --almost illegal-- the big brasses should never officially acknowledge its existence; yet, in the end, the head of the regiment requests a written report of the proceedings. An officer who was in the secret has been covering what was going on for several years and he describes to Michael York's character what the ""bad guy"" USUALLY does, but, frankly, during those years the bad guy did very little (a couple of attacks and little else; nothing we could call usual). From being an obnoxious cynical brat, an overbearing womanizer and a good for nothing drunkard who wants to get out of the military by any means, a character, in an inexplicable turnaround, ends up being a gentleman before the ladies and a naturally born soldier, willing to prove himself before his comrades. Also, it's unclear to me why in the end another character decides to leave the regiment when everything indicates that he should stay.In spite of these shortcomings, the film is extremely entertaining. Suspense and interest are very effective. Stacey Keach's character is impressive and very well done while Michael York carries his own subdued but intense role perfectly. All in all, very good.",4,"Gripping court mystery, great acting, heavy handed direction, strange behaviours, well written play",1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,2027,"['Placed', 'Victorian', 'India', 'film', 'uncomfortable', 'often', 'impossible', 'coexistence', 'honour', 'hypocrisy', 'prudishness', 'debauchery.Endowed', 'first', 'rate', 'international', 'cast', 'acting', 'superb', 'poor', 'Suzanna', 'York', 'forced', 'play', 'totally', 'uncalled', 'embarrassing', 'scene', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'as', 'artificial', 'anything', 'direction', 'ok', 'not', 'formidable', 'realism', 'fortunately', 'short', 'outtakes', 'marred', 'blatant', 'back', 'projections', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'actors', 'never', 'left', 'set', '.Dialogues', 'are', 'as', 'fine', 'usual', 'well', 'written', 'plays', 'end', 'explanation', 'mystery', 'strained', 'hardly', 'believable', 'Characters', 'act', 'strangely', 'guy', 'brutally', 'adulterous', 'women', 'friendship', 'lover', 'trial', 'supposed', 'be', 'unauthorized', 'almost', 'illegal', 'big', 'brasses', 'should', 'never', 'officially', 'acknowledge', 'existence', 'yet', 'end', 'head', 'regiment', 'written', 'report', 'proceedings', 'officer', 'who', 'was', 'secret', 'been', 'covering', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'several', 'years', 'Michael', 'York', 'character', 'what', 'bad', 'guy', 'USUALLY', 'frankly', 'years', 'bad', 'guy', 'did', 'very', 'little', 'couple', 'attacks', 'little', 'else', 'nothing', 'could', 'call', 'usual', 'being', 'obnoxious', 'cynical', 'brat', 'overbearing', 'womanizer', 'good', 'nothing', 'drunkard', 'who', 'get', 'military', 'means', 'character', 'inexplicable', 'turnaround', 'up', 'being', 'gentleman', 'ladies', 'naturally', 'born', 'soldier', 'willing', 'prove', 'comrades', 'Also', 'unclear', 'why', 'end', 'character', 'leave', 'regiment', 'when', 'everything', 'should', 'stay.In', 'spite', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'Suspense', 'interest', 'are', 'very', 'effective', 'Stacey', 'Keach', 'character', 'impressive', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Michael', 'York', 'own', 'subdued', 'intense', 'role', 'perfectly', 'very', 'good']",N/A

396301,A1I9B4PSCDDWOO,6304019610,"lordhoot ""lordhoot""","[3, 3]","Conduct Unbecoming proves to be a highly intriguing mystery movie that takes place in India during the latter part of the 19th Century during the height of the British Empire. In a world of high honor and integrity of Indian cavalry regiment, a dead officer's widow was attacked and her honor compromised. A new officer to the regiment falsely confessed to the crime in hopes to get out of the army but the regiment decided to conduct a secret court martial with dire consequences. Michael York played a fellow new officer assigned to defend the accused officer and he ends up investigating who was really responsible behind this attack. York proves to be superbly supported by Stacy Keach, Christopher Plummer, Richard Attenborough and Susannah York as the mystery slowly revealed itself to produced a shocking ending. The script reflects heavily on the hypocrisy of the regimental officers' honor codes, subliminal racism the white officers felt toward their native soldiers and enemies, stress of combat and friendships that lives on, even after death. But above all, Michael York's character provides the anchor from which all honor were judged by.The movie proves to be superbly acted, directed and the script sent a powerful message on the conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. The tragic look on Trevor Howard's face when he as the commanding officer, had to accept Michael York's resignation at the end of the movie because his regiment's standard of honor simply wasn't high enough for York, told volume of lies, deception and hypocrisy that were exposed under his command.The movie was based on the play and like written before, it does have a ""stage-like"" feel to the screen. But this sophisticated movie will definitely command your attention. If you have not seen it, then it should be a priority to do so.It never failed to amazed me why this movie is not on DVD yet. It definitely needs to be on that format as underrated as it was back in 1975, the movie have grown in reputation since then among those who have seen it. (Its hard enough to get it on VHS!)Update: This movie finally came out on DVD in November of 2005. It was nice to see it in widescreen format once more. However, the images are not as good as it can be and mono stereo sounds bit weak compared to whats out there. Although the package read ""Collector's Edition"", this is really a basic DVD package with no real special features. There a brief biographical sketch of the major players, a photo gallery and a trailer. There are two commentaries, one by Michael Anderson the director and other one by Michael York. Both are barely interesting. I thought they should have been combined to kill the dead space. Overall, a rather disappointing DVD whose standard does not match the high quality of the film itself.",5,Top notch mystery,1120953600,"07 10, 2005",2005,2803,"['Conduct', 'Unbecoming', 'be', 'highly', 'intriguing', 'mystery', 'movie', 'place', 'India', 'latter', 'part', '19th', 'Century', 'height', 'British', 'Empire', 'world', 'high', 'honor', 'integrity', 'Indian', 'cavalry', 'regiment', 'dead', 'officer', 'widow', 'was', 'attacked', 'honor', 'compromised', 'new', 'officer', 'regiment', 'falsely', 'confessed', 'crime', 'hopes', 'get', 'army', 'regiment', 'decided', 'conduct', 'secret', 'court', 'martial', 'dire', 'consequences', 'Michael', 'York', 'played', 'fellow', 'new', 'officer', 'assigned', 'defend', 'accused', 'officer', 'up', 'investigating', 'who', 'was', 'really', 'responsible', 'attack', 'York', 'be', 'superbly', 'supported', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'Susannah', 'York', 'mystery', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'produced', 'shocking', 'ending', 'script', 'heavily', 'hypocrisy', 'regimental', 'officers', 'honor', 'codes', 'subliminal', 'racism', 'white', 'officers', 'felt', 'native', 'soldiers', 'enemies', 'stress', 'combat', 'friendships', 'even', 'death', 'Michael', 'York', 'character', 'anchor', 'honor', 'were', 'judged', 'by.The', 'movie', 'be', 'superbly', 'acted', 'directed', 'script', 'sent', 'powerful', 'message', 'conduct', 'unbecoming', 'officer', 'gentleman', 'tragic', 'look', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'face', 'when', 'commanding', 'officer', 'had', 'accept', 'Michael', 'York', 'resignation', 'end', 'movie', 'regiment', 'standard', 'honor', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'high', 'enough', 'York', 'told', 'volume', 'lies', 'deception', 'hypocrisy', 'were', 'exposed', 'command.The', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'play', 'written', 'have', 'stage-like', 'feel', 'screen', 'sophisticated', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'command', 'attention', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'priority', 'do', 'so.It', 'never', 'failed', 'amazed', 'why', 'movie', 'not', 'DVD', 'yet', 'definitely', 'be', 'format', 'as', 'underrated', 'was', 'back', '1975', 'movie', 'have', 'grown', 'reputation', 'then', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'hard', 'enough', 'get', 'VHS', 'Update', 'movie', 'finally', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'November', '2005', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'widescreen', 'format', 'once', 'more', 'However', 'images', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'mono', 'stereo', 'sounds', 'bit', 'weak', 'compared', 'whats', 'out', 'there', 'package', 'read', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'really', 'basic', 'DVD', 'package', 'real', 'special', 'features', 'brief', 'biographical', 'sketch', 'major', 'players', 'photo', 'gallery', 'trailer', 'are', 'two', 'commentaries', 'one', 'Michael', 'Anderson', 'director', 'other', 'one', 'Michael', 'York', 'are', 'barely', 'interesting', 'thought', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'combined', 'kill', 'dead', 'space', 'Overall', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'DVD', 'standard', 'not', 'match', 'high', 'quality', 'film']",N/A

396305,A2BIAR1V0PWO27,6304019610,"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S...","[9, 9]","This is a wonderful period piece.  What makes this movie exceptional is the splendid depiction of regimental life in Old Raj India.  The 20th Indian Light Horse, a lance armed unit as shown in the film was typical of the old Indian army created by the British.  The unit is portrayed in the film by the Presidential Guard of Pakistan who seem to maintain the old traditions of the past.The beginning of the film shows a musical ride with the cavalry perfroming a unique dressage display highlighting formation movements that were typical of the day.  These were usually accompanied to regimental music as shown in the film.  This unique display is rarely seen nowadays, although the Household Cavalry in London have been known to perform similier displays.I have gone on about the period details of this film to indicate what a fine production it is over all.  As for the cast you can not find a more glittering example than here.  Some of the finest English actors of the 1960s and 70s are here.  As usual Richard Attenborough puts on a stellar performance as the deranged Major of the regiment. One is remided here of another great film he did like this in GUNS OF BATASI.  The remaining cast is equally superb.No doubt such regimental scandal was often covered up as shown in the film.  Such was not only common to the British, but to every army.  And remains so to this day for sure!  The officers shown here are all victims of a peacetime army one could say.  For so many years the Anglo-Indian army was mostly on peace time establishment that many often went mad with bordum.  Add also the oppressive heat and the unique circumstances of service in a strange and rich environment where Europeans reigned supreme; and its not surprsing that events as shown here may have taken place from time to time.This is not a war film per se, but more a study of regimental life.  The movie shows how traditions and honor can sometimes mean the opposite of what they appear, which none the less provide a code of conduct for the officer class.  It's important not to view this movie with a 21st century perspective.  Try to see it within the context of its time and place.Enjoy then what is a splendid period piece with great actors and fine sets, all lushly woven together into a tight storyline with a good deal of suspence.

396306,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6304019610,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 3]","Despite the boast of being 'filmed in location on the NorthWest Frontier and in Pakistan,' it's painfully obvious that none of the cast of Conduct Unbecoming ever got nearer to the NorthWest Frontier than the Shepperton Taste of Moghul Tandoori restaurant during their lunch break, with location filming clearly being limited to the director and a second unit shooting a few stock shots of cavalry and trains. With most of the money going on the impressive cast (Richard Attenborough, Christopher Plummer, Trevor Howard, James Donald and Stacey Keach in the days when he was still allowed into the UK without being detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure among them), the cutaways and resulting back-projection work are particularly poor, so it's a relief that this surprisingly gripping courtroom mystery spends most of its running time indoors as young officer Michael York reluctantly has to defend James Faulkner's black sheep of a distinguished family from a charge of assaulting Susannah York's widow of a regimental hero. As this is a matter of honour, to protect the good name of the regiment the case is heard by an unofficial 'Subaltern's Court Martial,' with the idealistic defender having it made clear that he's expected to just go through the motions by both the foreman and his own client: naturally, he does nothing of the sort, uncovering a nest of vipers and threatening to destroy his own career in the process. This adaptation of the kind of drama that used to be derisively called 'the well-made play' probably looked old-fashioned in 1976, but that tends to work in its favour today when being relevant isn't quite so important.
