It's like watching pretty girls and guys chatting stereotypically inside a teenager's dream with neither style nor substance.  I gave up with this film after this dialogue came out:  ""Fleas are people too."".",2,Plays like a pilot to a series,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,271,"['risque', 'language', 'body-talk', 'back', 'up', 'watching', 'pretty', 'girls', 'guys', 'chatting', 'stereotypically', 'teenager', 'dream', 'style', 'substance', 'gave', 'up', 'film', 'dialogue', 'came', 'out', 'Fleas', 'are', 'people', 'too']",N/A

Lacey Chabert hands in a terrific job of acting, where you might just believe she IS her character who can't find that right man.Although not a main character, SNL's Chris Kattan is always good for comic relief, too!Because of subject content and language, I would recommend SSILA for 18 and over.",5,Excellent date flick and/or chick flick!,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,437,"['lighthearted', 'comedy', 'almost', 'too', 'serious', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'ending', 'everything', 'worthwhile', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'terrific', 'job', 'acting', 'where', 'might', 'just', 'believe', 'character', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'right', 'man.Although', 'not', 'main', 'character', 'SNL', 'Chris', 'Kattan', 'always', 'good', 'comic', 'relief', 'too', 'subject', 'content', 'language', 'would', 'recommend', 'SSILA', '18', 'over']",N/A

Truthfully it was actually pretty good and it's about people looking for love and often overlooking what's right in front of them! I would describe it as a nice feel good romcom and yes, horror movies aside I;m a sucker for a good romantic comedy, it's a character flaw! This is without a doubt a chick flick but guys if you're looking to score points with your significant other than you could do worse!",4,Steve's Review,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,558,"['was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'be', 'honest', 'mainly', 'watched', 'Lacy', 'Chabert', 'was', 'so', 'figured', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'bad', 'Truthfully', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'people', 'looking', 'love', 'often', 'overlooking', 'what', 'right', 'front', 'would', 'describe', 'nice', 'feel', 'good', 'romcom', 'yes', 'horror', 'movies', 'aside', 'm', 'sucker', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'character', 'flaw', 'doubt', 'chick', 'flick', 'guys', ""'re"", 'looking', 'score', 'points', 'significant', 'other', 'could', 'do', 'worse']",N/A
