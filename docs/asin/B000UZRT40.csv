1098031,A1E9SNNS24DA02,B000UZRT40,"Amazon Customer ""chickenlittle25""","[11, 11]","This is a fabulous instructional video.  Please note that it is NOT an ""exercise for weightloss"" type of video, although it will work your arms.  But if you're looking for a strictly weight loss exercise/bellydance type of dvd this isn't it.I bought Sarah's other dvd when it first came out and loved it, at the end of it there is a performance section and has a veil section in it.  I remember thinking then that it would be great if she'd make a veil video....and here it is!  I hope she keeps coming out with more dvds in the future.  She has much to offer.If you want to learn about veilwork this is definitely worth the money.  It is well thought out and well done. The section on different types and qualities of fabrics is something I've not been able to find in another video.  It's nice to see the difference in the loft and qualities of the fabrics and to gain an understanding of how they're going to react, especially for someone like me who doesn't have access to bellydance shops and so I cannot try veils before I buy.  There are some great veil ideas and combos, everything from wraps and entrances to the finale is covered.  Finally there is a choreography using the combos you learned earlier.  The mishap recovery section has good ideas on how to turn a mistake into something that looks like it was done on purpose.My one and only complaint about this dvd is that Sarah is facing you when she instructs and she uses her left and right so you can either follow what she is doing or try and move to your left and right.  I prefer videos where the instructor either mirrors her moves to what I am doing or works in front of a mirror so that I can see the front and back and move the same direction that she is.  Still it's well worth 5 stars.",5,Excellent instruction!,1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,1759,"['fabulous', 'instructional', 'video', 'Please', 'note', 'NOT', 'exercise', 'weightloss', 'type', 'video', 'will', 'work', 'arms', ""'re"", 'looking', 'strictly', 'weight', 'loss', 'exercise/bellydance', 'type', 'dvd', ""n't"", 'it.I', 'bought', 'Sarah', 'other', 'dvd', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'loved', 'end', 'performance', 'section', 'veil', 'section', 'remember', 'thinking', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'great', ""'d"", 'make', 'veil', 'video', '.and', 'here', 'hope', 'coming', 'out', 'more', 'dvds', 'future', 'much', 'offer.If', 'want', 'learn', 'veilwork', 'definitely', 'worth', 'money', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'well', 'done', 'section', 'different', 'types', 'qualities', 'fabrics', 'something', ""'ve"", 'not', 'been', 'able', 'find', 'video', 'nice', 'see', 'difference', 'loft', 'qualities', 'fabrics', 'gain', 'understanding', 'how', ""'re"", 'going', 'react', 'especially', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'access', 'bellydance', 'shops', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'try', 'veils', 'buy', 'are', 'great', 'veil', 'ideas', 'combos', 'everything', 'wraps', 'entrances', 'finale', 'covered', 'Finally', 'choreography', 'using', 'combos', 'learned', 'earlier', 'mishap', 'recovery', 'section', 'good', 'ideas', 'how', 'turn', 'mistake', 'something', 'was', 'done', 'purpose.My', 'one', 'only', 'complaint', 'dvd', 'Sarah', 'facing', 'when', 'left', 'right', 'can', 'either', 'follow', 'what', 'doing', 'try', 'move', 'left', 'right', 'prefer', 'videos', 'where', 'instructor', 'mirrors', 'moves', 'what', 'am', 'doing', 'works', 'front', 'mirror', 'can', 'see', 'front', 'back', 'move', 'same', 'direction', 'Still', 'well', 'worth', '5', 'stars']","Belly Dance with Veil, taught by Sarah Skinner: Open level bellydance classes, Belly dance instruction, Veil belly dancing how-to."

Sarah is very thorough in explaining and breaking down the technique to work with your veil and to apply that into your performance. Every veil section has a short dance where you can see what it looks like to music. Some veil techniques are a little tricky so there is everything here for beginner to advanced dancer. You can really spice up your repertoire with the technique here because it covers more than the basics that you would learn in a regular belly dance class. There is also a handy section about what to do if you have a mishap during performance.

Ms Skinner begins on stage surrounded by her collection of multi-weighted, colored and varied cuts of cloth.

I was hungry to see and hear more regarding the properties resulting from different thread counts and strand thickness on a given fabric source such as 5mm silk, or the chiffons.
