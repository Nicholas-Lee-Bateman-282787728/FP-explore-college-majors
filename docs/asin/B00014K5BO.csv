792921,A33L7G4E8CID3,B00014K5BO,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[0, 0]","I have to admit that, aside from the original cast, my favorite SNL cast was the Phil Hartman-Jon Lovitz-Dana Carvey era. Such talent, and Phil Hartman was one of the best. Even though some of the targets of his impersonations have faded from memory (Donahue, Adm. Stockdale), his immense comic talent would make them hilarious to one who didn't know who these people were. Others, though, are truly marvelous--Frank Sinatra hosting The Sinatra Group was perhaps my favorite, Bill Clinton visiting a McDonalds was an excellent, if a bit obvious, choice. I smile when I think of his talentless propaganda-movie actor being told by Jon Lovitz that he's not needed anymore, or his Duke of Norfolk talking to Anne Boleyn (Candice Bergen) about possible execution methods. What can one say about his short film with Jan Hooks? It's not necessarily funny, but it is a striking moment, and an indellible image.Since I was still in grade school when Hartman was on the cast, my only knowledge of his talent before this was the occasional episode on Comedy Central. So, I can't say that I am the ultimate authority on what Hartman did on the show, but that made the DVD more worthwhile for me. I do wish that the Reagan Iran-Contra sketch had been fully included, instead of just a snippet, but I have that one on tape. Although I'm sure that everyone will have their opinion on what they consider to be Hartman's best work, but I think that this DVD represents a good portrait of the man's work, and why he is still regarded as one of the most talented cast members ever on SNL.",5,Great collection,1109462400,"02 27, 2005",2005,1570,"['have', 'admit', 'aside', 'original', 'cast', 'favorite', 'SNL', 'cast', 'was', 'Phil', 'Hartman-Jon', 'Lovitz-Dana', 'Carvey', 'era', 'Such', 'talent', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'Even', 'targets', 'impersonations', 'have', 'faded', 'memory', 'Donahue', 'Adm.', 'Stockdale', 'immense', 'comic', 'talent', 'would', 'make', 'hilarious', 'one', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'people', 'were', 'Others', 'are', 'truly', 'marvelous', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'hosting', 'Sinatra', 'Group', 'was', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'visiting', 'McDonalds', 'was', 'excellent', 'bit', 'obvious', 'choice', 'smile', 'when', 'think', 'talentless', 'propaganda-movie', 'actor', 'being', 'told', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'not', 'needed', 'anymore', 'Duke', 'Norfolk', 'talking', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'possible', 'execution', 'methods', 'What', 'can', 'one', 'say', 'short', 'film', 'Jan', 'Hooks', 'not', 'necessarily', 'funny', 'striking', 'moment', 'indellible', 'image.Since', 'was', 'still', 'grade', 'school', 'when', 'Hartman', 'was', 'cast', 'only', 'knowledge', 'talent', 'was', 'occasional', 'episode', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'am', 'ultimate', 'authority', 'what', 'Hartman', 'did', 'show', 'made', 'DVD', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'do', 'wish', 'Reagan', 'Iran-Contra', 'sketch', 'had', 'been', 'fully', 'included', 'instead', 'just', 'snippet', 'have', 'one', 'tape', ""'m"", 'sure', 'everyone', 'will', 'have', 'opinion', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'Hartman', 'best', 'work', 'think', 'DVD', 'good', 'portrait', 'man', 'work', 'why', 'still', 'regarded', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'cast', 'members', 'ever', 'SNL']",N/A

As possibly ""Saturday Night Live's"" most versatile star, he was a major influence on later, equally great castmembers Will Ferrell and Darrell Hammond (who is the only castmmebrs whose Bill Clinton impersonation matched up to Hartman). As always, when he died, Lorne and company decided it was time to put together a tribute show as they did for Chris Farley. The resulting ""The Best Of Phil Hartman"" was mixed at best.The first half is hilarious. Here, he gest to show up his versatillity in such roles as Frank Sinatra (""The Sinatra Group""), Bill Clinton (""Clinton At McDonald's""), Peter Graves (""Discover The World Of Science""), Phil Donahue (""Donahue""), and ""Barbara Bush (don't know name of sketch, but features Nancy Reagan (Jan Hooks) trying to take back the White House). Also, there's a great montage of his impressions. He became so well known for playing Bill Clinton, people forget that his repetoire included Ted Kennedy, Andy Griffith, Telly Savalas, Michael Caine and even Jesus. Also, there's his infamous ""Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer"" and one, the ""Weekend Update' ""All Drug Olympics"".But after this, the dvd falters. While ""Cooking With The Anal Retentive Chef"" ""Succinctly Speaking"", and the touching closer ""Love Is A Dream"" are worth viewing, the second montage (don't know what it's about), ""On Broadway"", ""Ann Boleyn"" and ""Robot Repair"" rank among the worst ""SNL"" skecthes ever.Is this dvd worth viewing? Yes. But is it perfect? By all means, no. How could it have been better? First, they could've taken out the entire second half (with the eexception of ""Anal Retentive Chef"", ""Succinctly Speaking"", and ""Love Is A Dream"") and replaced it with the ""Sinatra Duets"" sketch, another Clinton one, and a montage of his voiceovers.

792926,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B00014K5BO,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[11, 12]","Phil Hartman was a cast member on ""Saturday Night Live"" for eight years. During that time, he gave the show some its most memorable and hilarious moments. From zany recurring characters to dead - on impressions of people in the news, he always knew how the grab the audience. So after his untimely death in 1998, it was only fitting that the good peole at ""SNL"" would put together a collection of Phil's best moments on the show. The result, ""The Best Of Phil Hartman"", was a good collection but many people felt something was wrong.""The Best Of Phil Hartman"" starts off on a high note. Showcasing his memorable impressions such as Bill Clinton (I personally like his better than Darrell Hammond), Phil Donahue, Peter Graves, Ronald Reagan, Barbara Bush and Frank Sinatra (in the funniest sketch on the whole dvd) is a great way to kick things off. In fact, the first 45 minutes or so is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.However, there's a noticable drop in quality after the ""Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer"" sketch. Sketches like ""Anne Boleyn"" and ""Robot Repair"" are basically filler sketches added for time. Also, there are funnier Frankenstein, Tonto And Tarzan sketches than the one here, but they opt for their first appearance. I would havee loved for an ""As World Turn"" or ""Season's Greetings"" sketch. The only real keepers throughout this entire half are the end tribute and ""Cooking With The Anal Retentive Chef"".If they wanted to make a great tribute to Hartman, they should have devoted the first half to his impressions and the rest to his many recurring characters. Phil had a lot of memorable and funny characters - Mr. Claymore, gay talk show host Russell Clark, Mace the convict, Susan The Transsexual, Helen and even Jesus (which is actually more of an impression depending on your beliefs). All of them are either missing are butchered to mere snippets in montages.I was also very surprised that they didn't included ""The Environentally Conscious One"". This sketch was a parody of the movie ""The Wild One"" with Alec Baldwin in the Brando role, except he's a defender of the environment fighting pollutionist Phil Hartman. The best part of the sketch is at the end when Baldwin is about to ride off on his motorcycle while the town is being destroyed by pollution when Hartman jumps on and says, ""take me with you"". Hartman says it so funny and woman - like that Baldwin starts laughing. I truly expected it to be here (though I'm glad they kept the part in the ""Greenhilly"" sketch from the same episode where Baldwin and Hartman kiss each other).Overall, this dvd starts off great but really loses steam toward the end. Hopefully they will release of volume 2 of Hartman's best (like Phil's 1990s' successor Will Ferrell, although his second best - off was a lot less funnier than his first). Maybe then they can spare us a complete sketch of his Charlton Heston impression or maybe the ""Dating Game"" parody on ""Sprockets"" where he played Susan.

Judging by his long line of work, it would be hard to find just 20 sketches that would qualify as his best. In 1998, shortly after he was murdered by his wife Brynne, Lorne Michaels and Company came up with ""Saturday Night Live: The Best Of Phil Hartman"", which was soon released on dvd. The results were okay at best.The first half is hilarious. ""The Sinatra Group"" is my favorite, especiially the Sinead O'Connor (Jan Hooks) jokes. Also worth a view are ""Clinton At McDonald's"" and ""Discover The World Of Science With Peter Graves"", in which Hartman plays the screen veteran as a bumbling idiot (so gold is long and thin like, say, Kareem Abdul Jabaar?). Best of all, there's a montage of his impressions. So many people watch him for his Bill Clinton that they forget his repitoire ranged from Ted Kennedy to Burt Reynolds to Jesus. After the ""All Drug Olympics"" sketch, the dvd falters a bit, but enjoys a resurgance of hilarity with ""Cooking With The Anal Retentive Chef"". But skecthes like ""Robot Repair"" and ""On Broadway With Brenda Krouse"" just weren't as good as I expected. The final sketch is ""Love Is A Dream"", a short film with an ending that will leave you misty - eyed.Overall, not a bad set, but it could have been a better sketch.

792929,A28MAXJWDTNWQ0,B00014K5BO,C. Falconer,"[0, 0]","While this compilation is not as consistently funny as the Will Farrell ones, it definitely has its moments.  Thought he did a great imitation of Donahue (banging the mike on his head, while waiting for an answer was a good touch).  The funniest bit (I thought) was the 'Robot Presents' skit.  Every time it came back with another title for the show, and the robot explaining that the title doesn't reflect what the shows about, I laughed harder and harder.  When he came back with 'Let's Fix, Robots', I literally fell off the couch, because I was laughing so hard!  And the Anne Boleyn skit was very well written....especially when she keeps asking what will happen to her head after she is killed (Phil: your body will then be folded up and shot out of a canon....Candice: will my head then be shot at my body?).  I also throughly enjoyed the nice sendoff at the end, with him and Jan Hooks imitating an elderly couple, thinking back to their younger days.

For the life of me, I can't figure out why Phil's Susan The She-Male from Mike Meyers' Sprockets sketch isn't included (""Allo, my name is Susan, und I just got out of prison!""); I thought I was going to fall on the floor when ""she"" shared what a perfect date with Jason Priestlywould be. (Also, this for me was the funniest Sprockets skit ever--a parody of The Dating Game.) I also would have liked to have seen where he does his dead-on Frank Sinatra imitation and he's confronting Jan Hooks as Sinead O'Connor. It is a crime, also, that they left off 3 of his most unforgettable characters from Dana Carvey's Church Lady sketches: Donald Trump, Jimmy Swaggart, and the HYSTERICALLY funny bit with him as Jim Bakker and Jan Hooks as the hideously mascara-streaked tearful Tammy Faye Bakker. These 3 sketches had me LMAO.""Lastly, why the producers thought Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer belonged on here is a mystery to me. This was one of the VERY few examples of how not everything Phil did on SNL was solid gold--probably the most unfunny character in his entire repertoire. But considering the unbelievable talent this man had, it can easily be overlooked. The fact that he was taken from us in such a cruel & unnecessary way still hurts even today, and you can see from the final sketch on the DVD--a very touching musical number with Jan--that it absolutely devastated his fellow cast members...not to mention those of us who loved & respected him.

Sure, he lent his distinctive voice to ""The Simpsons"" cartoon show & worked on ""Newsradio"" (post-SNL). But there's no doubt he did his best work on SNL.The ""Bill Clinton jogging to McDonald's"" sketch eerily foreshadows the Lewinksy scandal yet to come (""Listen fellas, there's a LOT of things Mrs. Clinton doesn't know!""). His rare breakup on camera during a ""Tonto, Tarzan & Frankenstein"" sketch is memorable (he escaped by crashing through a wall). The Anal-Retentive Chef is one of my favorite Hartman bits. His sendup of a moronic Peter Graves hosting (and ruining) a science TV show is hilarious. And his early satire of a one-dimensional movie actor (circa 1947) talked into trying the new ""sci-fi monster"" genre (with fellow cast member Jon Lovitz) is classic stuff.Watching this collection, I can't help but respect & admire Hartman's wide range & professionalism as a comedy performer.Thank you, Phil, for all the laughs you've given us.
