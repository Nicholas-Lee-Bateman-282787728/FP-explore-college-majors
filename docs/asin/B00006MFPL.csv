You can feel the quality of her voice but the concert was so, so, incredibly boring, I mean, can you imagine being seated for 2 hours listening to a person just singing in sort of ""Capella style""?. If I would had been in that concert, I thought I would had stand up and leave the building.As I say, she's great and her latest album ""Skin"" is wonderful, actually it's my favorite, but don't waste your money buying this extra boring DVD.

To think all this time could have been rocking with Melissa!I was in the audience for the first night of this concert tour in Washington, D.C. To hear her talk about how she hoped her audience realized this wasn't a ""watch Melissa sit on a stool and strum her guitar"" concert  made me realize how important her audience and fans are to her.  She performs her heart out and gives everything she has to her audience.  Be sure to look for all the extras in this dvd.  I almost missed the behind the scenes at several of the concerts.  There is also a clip of her getting ready to go on the road and you get a glimpse of her home.  I can't wait to see her live again.  Thanks for the dvd Melissa!

Melissa was interviewed by an off-camera interviewer and the sound quality for both questions and (more importantly) Melissa's answers was horrible.  I had to turn the volume up -- way up -- and I could barely hear what was going on.  This was a major disappointment, especially since it could have been fixed during post-production.  This is only reason I give it 4 stars vs. 5 stars.

Eagerly awaiting the release and then having to wait for the shipment as well. But Halleluja! It was worth the wait. Melissa's voice is as strong as it's ever been and she is, I think, underrated as a guitarist... let's just say she can stand up to the best of the male guitarists. I've had the chance to show some of my friends the concert, and although they had no clue to who Melissa Etheridge were, they were totally amazed!

I thought I'd get bored with a solo acoustic tour but I was very wrong, this DVD is amazingly powerful and captivating.Her version of Joan Armatrading's song &quot;The weakness In me&quot; was just fabulous. She really connects to the audience and speaks from the heart.I think that Melissa, as a songwriter, is so warm and inviting because of that ability to connect with the audience on a very personal and heartfelt level.

Foster,"[6, 6]","Mammoth Melissa fan that I am, this first official Melissa DVD release has been an xciting event for this music fan - I received the DVD this morning and already have been engulfed by the electricity of this solo concert performance in LA, as part of Melissa's International live + Alone Tour.  Few artists, save Springsteen, with whom Melissa has been compared, have ever ventured a solo tour without band or backing support.  Melissa returns to her bar-performance roots and gives what I can only describe as a mesmerising rock performance of her anthology of hits & back-catalog.  Flawless vocals, energetic guitar playing and that engaging stage presence which Ms Etheridge commands, you cannot help but feel you are watching an artiste in her prime who does not reply on pyrotechnics, ... dancers or session musicians to convey her music- as these fans can testify at the show.  Standing throughout, they lap up Melissa's energy.  Top notch performances throughout, but kudos to the energy of Bring Me Some Water & The Different and the stunning delicacy of my personal fave The Weakness In Me (available on Nuthin But A She Thang cd).  Chills galore!!  The 2nd disc is brimming with additional features as described on this URL.  All I can say is that rock's formost female singer (along with La Benatar) is quite simply one of the most talented all round performers of our day.
