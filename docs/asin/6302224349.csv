302272,AGEIT17HENDIS,6302224349,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 2]","Most of the time film noir, especially crime noir out of the 1940s-1950s be-bop night, will get heavily involved in plot, and twists in plots and leave the question of motivation, deep motivation for the ""shrinks."" After all if the medium is the message as the communications guru of a long-gone era, Marshall McLuhan, used to argue then the message in these things is nothing but the old saw that crime does not pay, does not pay for anyone if you watch enough of these noirs. So it was kind of refreshing, if somewhat odd, to see a film like the film under review, Possessed, where a deep look at the motivation for a crime, the mental anguish over the act, and the clash over good and evil inside the individual get a work out.But wait a minute. Don't get too immersed in the prospects for a deep study of the human psyche under duress because the motivation for a crime here, murder, is nothing other than the reaction of a lovesick, thwarted woman, a woman scorned if you like. This is Hollywood after all.  So you can almost see, even before the act, the gun rising steadily in her hand. And that is what the plot-line here revolves around. How that gun got steadily into her hand to kill her blas&eacute; ex-lover.See Louise (played here in a half- glamorous, half-maniacal way via flash backs by Joan Crawford) was hopelessly in love with a returning upwardly-mobile ex- GI, David (played here by a caddish Van Heflin), who was driven more by the prospects of an engineering career than by romance. When he called the whole affair off Louise fell to pieces. Well kind of fell to pieces because in reaction she had only one thing on her mind-get her man back, come hell or high water.That hell or high water involved marrying the boss, the well-off boss (played by Raymond Massey), once his wife (who Louise had been acting as a nurse for) committed suicide although it was clear from the start that she still carried the torch for David. When David, who in the meantime had been working for her newly-minted husband, fell for his young daughter and planned to marry her Louise went over the edge. And over the edge, as I have already telegraphed, meant that sweet little equalizer, the revolver.The way that the story unfolds as flash-backs while Louise is in a state of mental deterioration in the psycho ward of a mental hospital is how we get that deep look, using the now crude but then  state-of-the-art 1940s psychiatric understanding of mental illness. That is what makes this one a cut above the- run-of-the-mill melodramatic 1940s noir (although there are more that enough melodramatic moments, especially between the relentlessly unhinged Louise and relentlessly heartless David). But when you think about it, even though Louise winds up in a psycho ward rather than the chair, crime still doesn't pay.

She won gold for ""Mildred Pierce"", a good role, but Crawford gets to pull out all the stops here ... it's intense to behold, and at the same time, a nuanced performance. The story is a mesmerizing tragedy that seduces the viewer with a stark opening sequence that leaves us so curious; and the movie engages us even moreso with eventual flashbacks that keep us wanting to learn more and more, and to see what may happen. We have the antihero/protagonist, Louise, who is obsessed and possessed by an 'homme fatale' (Van Heflin in a rather unlikeable role as a callous fellow who makes you wonder why anyone could go cuckoo over the likes of him).Some of this movie focuses on the mental issues that Louise Howell suffers and faces (there are doctors, medical terms thrown about, etc), but for me it was the plot and emotions that made this experience riveting: a romantic rejection leads to the main character's breakdown, and she seeps deeply into madness.If you enjoy film noir, or mystery/thriller movies, this will readily and satisfactorily fit the bill.

302277,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6302224349,Byron Kolln,"[0, 1]","Joan Crawford delivers one of her greatest performances in POSSESSED, which easily ranks up there with ""Mildred Pierce"" and ""Humoresque"" as her best movie vehicle.As the film opens, a mysterious woman wanders dazed through the streets of Los Angeles.  She is later admitted into a psychiatric hospital where, under the influence of drugs, she reveals her identity and the reasons why she has collapsed into a complete nervous breakdown.  Louise Howell (Crawford), a live-in nurse to the wealthy Graham family, harbours a not-very-subtle infatuation for neighbour David Sutton (Van Heflin).  Stifled by her devotion, David quickly makes his exit.  After the apparent suicide of Mrs Graham, Louise goes on to marry her employer (Raymond Massey), despite the hefty objections of his teenaged daughter Carol (Geraldine Brooks).  Already teetering on the edge of her sanity, Louise begins to become paranoid over Mrs Graham's death; and when David announces his plans to marry Carol, it may just be the final straw...Here in POSSESSED (directed by Curtis Bernhardt and based on a story by Rita Weiman), Joan Crawford delivers one of her most fascinating performances.  Louise is a woman walking the knife-edge of sanity and complete mental annihilation; she handles the job brilliantly.  Van Heflin, as the resident heel of the piece, does well too, but his character is so completely unsavoury that the audience doesn't really care too much about his fate.  Raymond Massey likewise plays down his role of Mr Graham.Most of the male roles in Joan Crawford movies are very forgettable; you are meant to focus your attention solely on Ms Crawford, but in POSSESSED, Joanie had some competion in Geraldine Brooks, who plays Graham's teenage daughter Carol.  It's almost a rehash of the Crawford/Ann Blyth dynamic in ""Mildred Pierce""; especially when Louise knocks Carol down the stairs in one of the movie's most memorable scenes...or does she?  Brooks adds some much-needed fireworks to the film.The DVD includes audio commentary with film historian Drew Casper, featurette ""The Quintessential Film Noir"", and the trailer.

She seems to be searching for a person named David.  Within short order she is whisked away to a hospital where she winds up in the psych ward.The film proceeds in flashback fashion to recount her story and her plummet into the abyss of schizophrenia.  Crawford is a nurse and caretaker of the ailing wife of wealthy oil industrialist Dean Graham, played by Raymond Massey.  She is carrying on an obsessive relationship with lakefront neighbor David Sutton, played by Van Heflin.  Her deep love and fixation for him is not a shared emotion.  She refuses accept his desire to extricate himself from the smothering relationship.Heflin, a construction engineer, coaxes Massey to hire him for a project that requires his presence in Canada, helping him escape from Crawford.  While he is gone Massey's wife Pauline commits suicide drowning herself in the lake.  Massey, a lonely man has become dependent on Crawford to care for his family and soon asks her to marry him.  While Crawford still pines for Heflin she accepts, much to the dismay of Massey's 20 year old daughter, who blames Crawford for her mother's death.Crawford's marriage settles into an accomodating one and she manages to smooth out her relationship with Massey's daughter.  When Heflin returns from Canada, Crawford still secretly obsessed with him, begins having delusions.  Her condition seriously worsens and she begins to have serious mental problems when she learns that Heflin and Massey's daughter Carol, played by Geraldine Brooks are in love and plan to marry.  Her jealousy compells her to quash this budding relationship by any means possible.Joan Crawford is absolutely at the top of her game in this riveting performance, depicting the horrors of mental illness.

302281,A8V74RZY8TIRJ,6302224349,"Forrest C. Hopson ""StarWatcher""","[3, 3]","""Possessed"" (1947) is filled with classic elements of the film noir movies of the 1940's.  Dark and compelling backgrounds, dramatic musical score, and the ever-present feeling of suspense.  ""Possessed"" is one of my favorite Joan Crawford melodramas, running a close second to her brilliant performance in ""Sudden Fear"" (1952).  Crawford plays a woman obsessed with a self-absorbed architect, David Sutton, (played cunningly by Van Heflin) who will stop at nothing to make him her own.  Joan does a fabulous job playing this part for she seems genuinely possessed with it.  Joan's character, Louise Howell, is the in-home nurse caring for the wife of an elderly and very wealthy Mr. Dean Graham, played by Raymond Massey.  As the story progresses Massey's wife dies in a drowning accident (we never actually see the wife, only hear her cool, commanding voice nagging at Louise), which leaves Massey free to marry Louise.  Massey's beautiful, young daughter, Carol Graham (played sweetly, yet with a bitter edge by Geraldine Brooks), does not like the idea of Louise taking the place of her deceased mother, however, in a Mildred Pierce like scene, Louise and Carol bury the hatchet.  All seems to be going well for poor, troubled Louise until David Sutton comes walking back into her life.  Throughout this picture, it seems Louise would be fine until David came back into her life.  It was as though he enjoyed torturing her with his presence.  David comes to Louise and Dean's wedding, he's always popping up at their house to talk business with Dean, he's at the same theater as Louise and Carol, and Carol invites him to come and sit with her and Louise, and he does.  If he didn't enjoy torturing or just simply trifling with Louise, he should have left her alone.

The first is when Louise returns home after the theater and is then followed by Carol and David, what she does to Carol is a real shocker here.  The second is the creepy return to the lake house and Joan goes up to Mrs. Graham's bedroom and begins to scream.

Only after she is admitted to a ""Psychopatic Unit"" do we begin to discover her story in a series of flashbacks. Her story with David is explained.Van Heflin is the brutally honest David. I hadn't seen a young ""Van Heflin"" before this film so it was a nice treat as was seeing Raymond Massey as Louise's employer--a man who is genuinely in love with Louise.As her world begins to crash down around her, Louise becomes more and more ""possessed"" with inner demons and hallucinations. Joan Crawford could not have found a better role for her talents. She has the right ""look"" and the right range of emotions.The brief but fascinating special feature ""POSSESSED: THE QUINTESSENTIAL FILM NOIR"" gives a interesting look into the film noir genre that was a staple for Warner Brothers through the 40's - a dark and somber story with mood-setting lighting and a talented cast make POSSESSED a perfect example of film noir.",4,Classic Joan Crawford at her Best,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,1316,"['easy', 'see', 'why', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'portrayal', 'scorned', 'forlorn', 'Louise', '1947', 'film.It', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'worthy', 'Academy', 'Award', 'POSSESSED', 'also', 'classic', 'film', 'noir', 'way', 'only', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'could', 'do', 'it.POSSESSED', 'starts', 'amazingly', 'quiet', 'streets', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'emotionally', 'broken', 'Louise', 'searching', 'DAVID', 'Only', 'admitted', 'Psychopatic', 'Unit', 'do', 'begin', 'discover', 'story', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'story', 'David', 'explained.Van', 'Heflin', 'brutally', 'honest', 'David', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'young', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'film', 'was', 'nice', 'treat', 'was', 'seeing', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'Louise', 'employer', 'man', 'who', 'genuinely', 'love', 'Louise.As', 'world', 'crash', 'down', 'Louise', 'more', 'more', 'possessed', 'inner', 'demons', 'hallucinations', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'found', 'better', 'role', 'talents', 'right', 'look', 'right', 'range', 'emotions.The', 'brief', 'fascinating', 'special', 'feature', 'POSSESSED', 'QUINTESSENTIAL', 'FILM', 'NOIR', 'interesting', 'look', 'film', 'noir', 'genre', 'was', 'staple', 'Warner', 'Brothers', '40', 'dark', 'somber', 'story', 'mood-setting', 'lighting', 'talented', 'cast', 'make', 'POSSESSED', 'perfect', 'example', 'film', 'noir']",N/A

I have to admit that I was surprised by how good the film and Crawford were.  It tells the story of how Crawford descends into madness when her lover, Van Heflin, spurns her and she cannot get past her love for him.  She becomes obsessed with him (or should I say ""possessed"" with her love for him), despite marriage to her employer, Raymond Massey, and the growing relationship between Massey's daughter, Geraldine Brooks, and Heflin.  Her increasing madness threatens to ruin the lives of everyone around her.  The story is framed well, with a terrific opening of Crawford wandering the streets on the verge of catatonia, eventually relaying the events that led her to this point while under observation in a psychiatric ward.  Crawford really delivers with this performance, apparently willing to forego some of the artificial glamour that I associate her with.  It's a very effective performance of a woman on the edge.  Heflin, Massey, and Brooks are also strong here.  Director Curtis Bernhardt really establishes a dark mood, with some excellent shots and moments that establish Crawford's growing insanity.

She beat her Oscar-winning performance.  Spiffy.  Most people think horror movies are scary.  This  move frightened me a little.  Joan plays a woman afflicted with  schizophrenia who loses her ability to tell what's real from what isn't.  She begins having visions, in her head, of doing things.  When she finds  out she didn't do them, she is surprised.  She becomes obssessed with her  lover, played by Van Heflin, but he has fallen out of love with her.  She's  too clingy.  She sets up elaborate schemes to get him back.  She marries a  wealthy man (she was a nurse for his wife, until his wife killed herself),  and tries to get his daughter to like her.  She does, but likes Van even  more.  Joan cooks up more things.  By this time, she is convinced that she  helped her husband's former wife kill herself.  Her husband has to  straighten her out.  How this all comes together to create a harrowing  movie is amazing.  There is even a murder.

Just some thoughts on this classic film noir from 1947...Possessed (1947) stars Joan Crawford, Van Heflin, Raymond Massey, and Geraldine Brooks.  Crawford also made a movie titled Possessed in 1931 while with MGM.  Basically the movie is about a mentally unstable woman who is obsessed with her ex-lover.  This 1947 Warner Bros. movie is very much on the dark side - film noir at its finest, something Warner Bros. excelled at in the 1940s.  The opening shot of Crawford walking down the streets of the city in a daze is classic.  This black and white movie has a lot of great camera angles to go along with shadowy and dim environments that make this a film noir classic.  The acting is superb, with Crawford giving a career performance and Heflin giving a great performance himself.  This is one of those movies that gets better and better as it goes along.  Franz Waxman's musical score is great as well - dark and haunting at times.Crawford was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in this film, but didn't win (should have).  This DVD has a great 10 minute feature about the movie and its status in the film noir category of movies.  I also enjoy Dr. Drew Casper's enthusiastic audio commentary (as a special feature option).If you want to see a quality movie that's on the dark side, see Possessed.

At the beginning, she is a nurse to a rich man's ailing wife, and also deeply in love with his engineer neighbor, David Sutton (played by Van Heflin).

302294,AAW58LG72PG7I,6302224349,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 1]","When we think of Joan Crawford at her best, two films come to mind, MILDRED PIERCE and POSSESSED.  Both films show Crawford as edgy and risk taking, but as Mildred Pierce she was driven in a positive way to achieve material success.  But as Louise in POSSESSED, Crawford assumed a persona that in the hands of a lesser might have come off as a woman so over the top that we soon lose interest.  But we do not because from the first moments of her walking the streets of Los Angeles in a mental haze until the final shocking moment when her innermost memories are dragged to the surface we see director Curtis Berhardt combine film noir moodiness with Grade B flasbacks to create an indelible portrait of a scorned woman instantly recognizable as an early ancestor of Glen Close from FATAL ATTRACTION.Crawford has plenty of talent around her.  Van Heflin as David is so perfectly cast as the ""normal"" or ""average"" lover that we want to eviscerate him for failing to see her lurking demons.  Raymond Massey as her older husband is a powerful rock of support for all those around him, but Crawford is beyond marital aid.  Geraldine Brooks as Carol, Massey's daughter and Heflin's burgeoning love interest, shows a convincing ability to extend her own range of emotion from an initial dislike of Crawford to a liking and eventually reverting to that same dislike.  But from start to finish, this is Crawford's movie.  She was a deserved nominee for Best Actress.  When she made POSSESSED she was forty-two years old and played a Louise of approximately the same age.  Geraldine Brooks tells us that Heflin is thirty-five, and the half dozen years gap between Heflin and Crawford adds a dark subtext that a scorned older woman feels for her jilting younger lover.  Much of the film occurs in flashback with Crawford committed to a psychiatric ward, but we have no problem keeping the divergent time lines straight.  A surprising amount of time is spent showing Crawford flat on her back staring unblinkingly at the ceiling and even in these crushing moments, she manages to emote a stifled inner self seeking release.  How we are supposed to react to the many faces of a clearly disturbed Crawford is a function of what she manages to elicit from each viewer.  Such a rare ability is probably why she managed to snag the Oscar nomination in the first place.",5,Crawford at her Best,1261267200,"12 20, 2009",2009,2352,"['When', 'think', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'best', 'two', 'films', 'come', 'mind', 'MILDRED', 'PIERCE', 'POSSESSED', 'films', 'show', 'Crawford', 'edgy', 'risk', 'taking', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'was', 'driven', 'positive', 'way', 'achieve', 'material', 'success', 'Louise', 'POSSESSED', 'Crawford', 'assumed', 'persona', 'hands', 'lesser', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'woman', 'so', 'top', 'soon', 'lose', 'interest', 'do', 'not', 'first', 'moments', 'walking', 'streets', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'mental', 'haze', 'final', 'shocking', 'moment', 'when', 'innermost', 'memories', 'are', 'dragged', 'surface', 'see', 'director', 'Curtis', 'Berhardt', 'combine', 'film', 'noir', 'moodiness', 'Grade', 'B', 'flasbacks', 'create', 'indelible', 'portrait', 'scorned', 'woman', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'early', 'ancestor', 'Glen', 'Close', 'FATAL', 'ATTRACTION.Crawford', 'plenty', 'talent', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'David', 'so', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'normal', 'average', 'lover', 'want', 'eviscerate', 'failing', 'see', 'lurking', 'demons', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'older', 'husband', 'powerful', 'rock', 'support', 'Crawford', 'marital', 'aid', 'Geraldine', 'Brooks', 'Carol', 'Massey', 'daughter', 'Heflin', 'burgeoning', 'love', 'interest', 'convincing', 'ability', 'extend', 'own', 'range', 'emotion', 'initial', 'dislike', 'Crawford', 'liking', 'eventually', 'reverting', 'same', 'dislike', 'start', 'finish', 'Crawford', 'movie', 'was', 'deserved', 'nominee', 'Best', 'Actress', 'When', 'made', 'POSSESSED', 'was', 'forty-two', 'years', 'old', 'played', 'Louise', 'approximately', 'same', 'age', 'Geraldine', 'Brooks', 'Heflin', 'thirty-five', 'half', 'dozen', 'years', 'gap', 'Heflin', 'Crawford', 'dark', 'subtext', 'scorned', 'older', 'woman', 'feels', 'jilting', 'younger', 'lover', 'Much', 'film', 'flashback', 'Crawford', 'committed', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'have', 'problem', 'keeping', 'divergent', 'time', 'lines', 'straight', 'surprising', 'amount', 'time', 'spent', 'showing', 'Crawford', 'flat', 'back', 'staring', 'unblinkingly', 'ceiling', 'even', 'crushing', 'moments', 'emote', 'stifled', 'inner', 'self', 'seeking', 'release', 'How', 'are', 'supposed', 'react', 'many', 'clearly', 'disturbed', 'Crawford', 'function', 'what', 'elicit', 'viewer', 'rare', 'ability', 'probably', 'why', 'managed', 'snag', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'first', 'place']",N/A
302295,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,6302224349,mirasreviews,"[3, 5]","""Possessed"" opens with a strikingly unglamorous view of Joan Crawford and goes on to present one of Crawford's greatest roles. Dazed and confused, Louise Howell (Joan Crawford) wanders the streets of Los Angeles looking for a man named ""David"". She is taken to a hospital and placed in the psychiatric ward in a catatonic stupor. Using drugs, her doctor (Stanley Ridges) induces Louise to tell him how she came to be in this state. The film flashes back to her romance with David Sutton (Van Heflin), a man whom she loved passionately, while she was employed as a nurse by Mr. Dean Graham (Raymond Massey) to care for his invalid wife. When David leaves her, Louise becomes hysterical, and she begins to lose control of her mind.The 1947 theatrical trailer for this film dramatically described Louise Howell as ""Possessed...by the Maddest Love a Woman Ever Knew!"" and ""Possessed...by the Strangest Fear a Heart Ever Held!"" Surprisingly, it wasn't hyperbole. Joan Crawford's performance is a two-pronged powerhouse. She expresses a love for David so deep that the pain of his loss produces psychosis. The audience can feel Louise's emotional fabric tear when David leaves. Louise is well aware that she is hallucinating and becoming irrational. We sense her terror as she tries desperately to cling to reality. Louise Howell is a femme fatale, but not of her own making. She can't control her behavior. Director Curtis Bernhardt creates empathy for her by frequently presenting a subjective point of view. We see what Louise sees and can no more tell if her hallucinations are real than she can. David Sutton is an unusual character for his time. He is a sort of homme fatal, an object of desire who is fully aware of his attractiveness to women. In a reversal of traditional gender roles, Louise is consumed by obsession for her lover. Although ""Possessed"" is more sympathetic to Louise, both characters are self-absorbed, and it is fascinating to watch them interact.""Possessed"" is a film noir of the female melodrama genre that is notable for its heavily Freudian themes and subjective style. It's one of those films that make me marvel at the amount of thought that went into characters and mise-en-scene, from writers Sylvia Richards and Ranald MacDougall -who based the screenplay on a story by Rita Weiman in ""Cosmopolitan"" magazine- to the director, actors, and creative crew. This is a psychological thriller that is heavy on the psychology. The doctors' Freudian analysis of Louise's troubles may seem less than compelling now, but the 1940s were the decade for Freud in the United States, which made for very entertaining movies. ""Possessed "" is a wonderful film noir with an outstanding performance by Joan Crawford.The DVD (Warner Brothers 2005): The print of the film has not been restored but is generally good except for one minute. Beginning 48 minutes into the film and ending at about 49 minutes, spots that resemble water marks dance across the screen. Bonus features include one featurette, a theatrical trailer (2 minutes), and an audio commentary. ""Possessed: Quintessential Film Noir"" (9 minutes) is interviews with film theorists and authors Glenn Erikson, James Ursini, Dr. Drew Casper, and Eddie Muller, in which they talk about the classic film noir movement and the noir characteristics of ""Possessed"". The audio commentary is by USC professor Dr. Drew Casper, who discusses film noir in general and gives an adoring dissertation about Joan Crawford. He explains the inversion of American film in the 1940s and the prevalence of Freudian themes, as well as other characteristics of classic film noir. Dr. Casper presents a lot of information that would be useful to those seeking a mini-course on Joan Crawford or film noir. He does do visual analysis of some scenes, but the commentary would have benefitted from more analysis of this film specifically.

I'm sure they will be pleasantly pleased by the wonderful range of ability displayed by Joan in what is without a doubt one of her finest performances during the 1940's.Often overshadowed by her wonderful performance in her first Warner film in 1945 ""Mildred Pierce"", for which she won an Oscar as Best Actress, ""Possessed"" involved a far more difficult acting task for Joan Crawford in a role that had numerous layers of complexity dealing as it did with the tragic issue of schizophrenia and its effects on the mind. Crawford rises admirably to the task and received a second Academy Award nomination for her work here. ""Possessed"" (not to be confused with an earlier film of the same name that Joan made costarring Clark Gable at MGM in the 1930's) tells the story of a personal nurse Louise Howell who suffers through a one sided love affair with  David Sutton (Van Heflin in a stand out performance) an eternal bachelor type who is not willing to commit to an ongoing relationship and treats Louise with a dimissive attitude that feeds her inner uncertainity. The tragic consequences of this lack of love in Louise's life eventually leds to murder and a total mental breakdown with her being taken to a psychiatric hospital. Despite eventually marrying the husband (Raymond Massey), of her sick charge after her death  as a form of compensation the obsession with David never leaves Louise and when he returns to her part of the world after working in Canada the old attraction that Louise thought she had buried forever  returns with tragic results. The lack of response in David to her advances unhinges Louise's mind and she eventually forsakes her new family and shoots David as a form of revenge for the hurt he has caused her. This action springing from her schizophrenia completely sends louise over the edge to the extent that she looses the knowledge of who she is and what she has done.Joan Crawford's handling of this complex role is light years away from much of her earlier work at MGM. Her depiction of the schizophrenic mind at work and how it distorts the personality is brilliantly displayed. Crawford made a famous quote about this film in that she stated that she worked harder on ""Possessed"" than on any other film in her career and it is easy to see that she was corrct in saying that. She is at times loving, desperate, frantic in her illusionary world and lack of control of it, and heart wrenching as her character progressively looses her grasp on reality. Besides her power house performance most of the other characters have a hard time competing. Van Heflin is fine as the object of her desire who moves from a playful dismissing of Louise's affections to an almost open hostility towards her to his own detriment and Raymond Massey in a surprise performance creates a sympathetic portrayal as Louise's devoted husband who marries her despite knowing her attention is elsewhere and who battles trying to fully understand Louise's condition and possible treatment. One standout in the cast is young Geraldine Brooks as Louise's step daughter Carol who begins a relationship with David under Louise's nose unwittingly triggering off Louise's psychotic tendencies. Done with all the customery gloss of the noir genre at its height the film benefits from beautiful photography and a distinctly shadowy black and white look. This shadowy effect really heightens the ""grey"" feel of the story and makes the progression of Louise's character so much more engrossing to witness. This is an instance where colour photography would have been a grave error. In ""Possessed"" Joan Crawford has rarely been photographed more stunningly and it's a shame that it almost marked the last time she was so flatteringly photographed just prior to the hardening that her screen image began to take on in the late 1940's.Depressing and heavy the theme of ""Possessed"" may appear to the reader however what unfolds is an fascinating story that is bold in the theme that it explored. Schizophrenia is not a topic often tackled by mainstream Hollywood but it is dealt with in an honest and straightforward manner. Joan Crawford's understanding of this role gives the film a strong conviction that rings true and it all adds up to an engrossing melodrama of the higest order with an interesting storyline, terrific performances and a bit of education of just how the mind can react under different circumstances. Enjoy Joan Crawford in her greatest acting role of her 1940's career.",5,Oscar nominated Joan Crawford in one of her best roles,1042675200,"01 16, 2003",2003,4637,"['numerous', 'detractors', 'who', 'complain', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'acting', 'ability', 'need', 'watch', 'screening', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'Noir', 'classic', 'Possessed', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'pleased', 'wonderful', 'range', 'ability', 'displayed', 'Joan', 'what', 'doubt', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', ""1940's.Often"", 'overshadowed', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'first', 'Warner', 'film', '1945', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Possessed', 'involved', 'far', 'more', 'difficult', 'acting', 'task', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'role', 'had', 'numerous', 'layers', 'complexity', 'dealing', 'did', 'tragic', 'issue', 'schizophrenia', 'effects', 'mind', 'Crawford', 'admirably', 'task', 'received', 'second', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'work', 'here', 'Possessed', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'earlier', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'Joan', 'made', 'costarring', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'MGM', '1930', 'story', 'personal', 'nurse', 'Louise', 'Howell', 'who', 'one', 'sided', 'affair', 'David', 'Sutton', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'stand', 'out', 'performance', 'eternal', 'bachelor', 'type', 'who', 'not', 'willing', 'commit', 'ongoing', 'relationship', 'treats', 'Louise', 'dimissive', 'attitude', 'inner', 'uncertainity', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'lack', 'love', 'Louise', 'life', 'eventually', 'murder', 'total', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'being', 'taken', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'eventually', 'marrying', 'husband', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'sick', 'charge', 'death', 'form', 'compensation', 'obsession', 'David', 'never', 'Louise', 'when', 'part', 'world', 'working', 'Canada', 'old', 'attraction', 'Louise', 'thought', 'had', 'buried', 'forever', 'returns', 'tragic', 'results', 'lack', 'response', 'David', 'advances', 'unhinges', 'Louise', 'mind', 'eventually', 'new', 'family', 'shoots', 'David', 'form', 'revenge', 'hurt', 'caused', 'action', 'springing', 'schizophrenia', 'completely', 'louise', 'edge', 'extent', 'knowledge', 'who', 'what', 'done.Joan', 'Crawford', 'handling', 'complex', 'role', 'light', 'years', 'away', 'much', 'earlier', 'work', 'MGM', 'depiction', 'schizophrenic', 'mind', 'work', 'how', 'personality', 'brilliantly', 'displayed', 'Crawford', 'made', 'famous', 'quote', 'film', 'stated', 'worked', 'harder', 'Possessed', 'other', 'film', 'career', 'easy', 'see', 'was', 'corrct', 'saying', 'times', 'loving', 'desperate', 'frantic', 'illusionary', 'world', 'lack', 'control', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'character', 'progressively', 'grasp', 'reality', 'power', 'house', 'performance', 'most', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'competing', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'fine', 'object', 'desire', 'who', 'playful', 'dismissing', 'Louise', 'affections', 'almost', 'open', 'hostility', 'own', 'detriment', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'surprise', 'performance', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'Louise', 'devoted', 'husband', 'who', 'knowing', 'attention', 'elsewhere', 'who', 'trying', 'fully', 'understand', 'Louise', 'condition', 'possible', 'treatment', 'One', 'standout', 'cast', 'young', 'Geraldine', 'Brooks', 'Louise', 'step', 'daughter', 'Carol', 'who', 'relationship', 'David', 'Louise', 'nose', 'unwittingly', 'triggering', 'off', 'Louise', 'psychotic', 'tendencies', 'Done', 'customery', 'gloss', 'noir', 'genre', 'height', 'film', 'benefits', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'distinctly', 'shadowy', 'black', 'white', 'look', 'shadowy', 'effect', 'really', 'grey', 'feel', 'story', 'progression', 'Louise', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'engrossing', 'witness', 'instance', 'where', 'colour', 'photography', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'grave', 'error', 'Possessed', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'rarely', 'been', 'photographed', 'more', 'stunningly', 'shame', 'almost', 'marked', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'flatteringly', 'photographed', 'just', 'prior', 'hardening', 'screen', 'image', 'began', 'take', 'late', ""1940's.Depressing"", 'heavy', 'theme', 'Possessed', 'may', 'appear', 'reader', 'however', 'what', 'fascinating', 'story', 'bold', 'theme', 'explored', 'Schizophrenia', 'not', 'topic', 'often', 'tackled', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'dealt', 'honest', 'straightforward', 'manner', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'understanding', 'role', 'film', 'strong', 'conviction', 'true', 'up', 'engrossing', 'melodrama', 'higest', 'order', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'terrific', 'performances', 'bit', 'education', 'just', 'how', 'mind', 'can', 'react', 'different', 'circumstances', 'Enjoy', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'greatest', 'acting', 'role', '1940', 'career']",N/A

In ""Possessed"" Joan plays a private nurse involved with a man played by Van Heflin who doesn't return Crawford's love. Once she realizes her lover will never love her back she shoots him in cold blood. In this piece Joan plays the crazed woman to the hilt, without the campyness that would follow some of her later performances in ""Straight Jacket"" and ""I Saw What You Did"", movies that showed Joan playing women that were wronged by her lovers. For ""Possessed"" Crawford actually pulled a few strings in Southern California to view and witness what went on in loony bins and psycho wards in order to bring reality to her role in this film. Joan would learn that playing psychos were one of the hardest roles to endure. As she said"" I always thought you pulled out all the stops and acted either manic or depressive and that was it"". She also stated that she worked harder on ""Possessed"" than in any of her 81 films. When Joan teamed up with Cliff Robertson in ""Autumn Leaves"" in 1956 she used her experience playing a psychotic in ""Possessed"" to help teach Robertson how playing this kind of character was.
