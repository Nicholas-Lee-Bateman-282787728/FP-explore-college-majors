Admire,"[10, 11]","Truthfully, the main reason I keep _The Amorous Mis-Adventures of Casanova_ in my DVD library (actually, I re-added it this spring after having sold it off last year) is because of all the Euro-beauties who doff their clothes in this film - Britt Ekland, Marisa Berenson, Sylva Koscina, et al. If it weren't for them, I'd frankly find this film rather dull.  As it is, it's more plodding than a movie about Casanova's life ought to be.  But just when I get bored, a new beauty falls into Casanova's life and bed and out of her clothes, so I keep watching.  And so it goes...",3,"Beautiful women, but to my way of thinking, somewhat plodding",1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,574,"['Truthfully', 'main', 'reason', 'keep', '_The', 'Amorous', 'Mis-Adventures', 'Casanova_', 'DVD', 'library', 'actually', 're-added', 'spring', 'having', 'sold', 'off', 'last', 'year', 'Euro-beauties', 'who', 'doff', 'clothes', 'film', 'Britt', 'Ekland', 'Marisa', 'Berenson', 'Sylva', 'Koscina', 'et', 'al', 'were', ""n't"", ""'d"", 'frankly', 'find', 'film', 'rather', 'dull', 'more', 'plodding', 'movie', 'Casanova', 'life', 'ought', 'be', 'just', 'when', 'get', 'bored', 'new', 'beauty', 'Casanova', 'life', 'bed', 'clothes', 'keep', 'watching']",The Amorous Mis-Adventures of Casanova
839063,A29SXQTFPRM62D,B0002KVUJS,"Ogleman ""jazzbuff""","[2, 3]","Well, if you like a flick that has lots of T and A with bawdy, and at times, sophmoric humor ala Benny Hill then this butt's for you. (And friends that poor pun is indeed an indication of the level of humor in this film.) However, I wasn't expecting anything more and so I was satisfied -- this being similar to some of  the Seduction Cinema fodder you might watch -- you don't watch it for cinematic excellence.Why Tony Curtis chose to play the lead in this is beyond me. Judging from the way he plays the character I assume he laughed all the way to the bank. He does seem to be having fun but then why wouldn't he, surrounded by more babes than you can shake a schtick at. The plot is a just an excuse for jokes and bare skin so if you expect to learn a single thing about the life of Casanova, forget it. Historical, it ain't.Still I gave it 4 stars because it was just what it proposed to be, a buxom, oversexed send up that was designed to appeal to prurient interests -- and it certainly appealed to mine. Then again, I like Benny Hill so what do I know.
