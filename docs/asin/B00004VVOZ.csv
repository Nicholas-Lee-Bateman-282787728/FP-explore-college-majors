553035,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00004VVOZ,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[8, 9]","This Ermanini Olmo film is filled with magical moments, taken at a leisurely pace; if your usual viewing fare is action packed and music video speed, you might want to pass this one by.The visual beauty of the panoramic Moroccan landscapes and its handsome people are wonderful to watch, but the main attraction here is the narration by the great Paul Scofield (""A Man for all Seasons"") in a poetic reading of this section of the Bible.The script fairly accurately follows the first nine chapters of Genesis, with a few added portions, like excerpts from the Song of Solomon, Leviticus Ch. 26, and Psalm 50.Omero Antonutti plays ""the grandfather"" and ""Noah"", and the rest of the cast are simply listed as ""people of Morocco"". The children are exquisite, and the costuming gives the feeling of ancient nomadic times.The score by Ennio Morricone includes tribal folk music and predominantly, the strange and glorious sound of ""Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares"".I find this film extraordinarily soothing, and the words are like music and calming to the mind and soul; I like to put this film on while I am working, or when I just want to turn the frantic tempo of today's world down a notch.",4,serene and satisfying,1070841600,"12 8, 2003",2003,1184,"['Ermanini', 'Olmo', 'film', 'filled', 'magical', 'moments', 'taken', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'usual', 'viewing', 'fare', 'action', 'packed', 'music', 'video', 'speed', 'might', 'want', 'pass', 'one', 'by.The', 'visual', 'beauty', 'panoramic', 'Moroccan', 'landscapes', 'handsome', 'people', 'are', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'main', 'attraction', 'here', 'narration', 'great', 'Paul', 'Scofield', 'Man', 'Seasons', 'poetic', 'reading', 'section', 'Bible.The', 'script', 'fairly', 'accurately', 'first', 'nine', 'chapters', 'Genesis', 'few', 'added', 'portions', 'excerpts', 'Song', 'Solomon', 'Leviticus', 'Ch', '26', 'Psalm', '50.Omero', 'Antonutti', 'grandfather', 'Noah', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'simply', 'listed', 'people', 'Morocco', 'children', 'are', 'exquisite', 'costuming', 'feeling', 'ancient', 'nomadic', 'times.The', 'score', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'tribal', 'folk', 'music', 'predominantly', 'strange', 'glorious', 'sound', 'Le', 'Mystere', 'Voix', 'Bulgares', '.I', 'find', 'film', 'extraordinarily', 'soothing', 'words', 'are', 'music', 'calming', 'mind', 'soul', 'like', 'put', 'film', 'am', 'working', 'when', 'just', 'want', 'turn', 'frantic', 'tempo', 'today', 'world', 'down', 'notch']",N/A

For dramatization, try 'The Bible ... in the beginning' by J. Huston or 'Noah', from the BBC's 'Bible in animation' series. It is incongruous to depict the Creation and paradise in an almost desert environment. The film 'drags' slowly through the stories we know so well from the Book of Genisis. There are some redeeming features however. Some of the filming is very artistic, with some stunning visuals. I believe that E. Morricone composed the score for the film.

Although the music is very period-like for the era, the program is confusing in its depiction of Adam and Eve and the serpent.  What was intriguing, however, was the concept of Eve not being Caucasian.  In that part of the world (Middle East), it would only stand to reason that Eve would be a woman of color.
