They are wonderful for babies/toddlers who are unable to speak but can learn to ask for things or say things by &#34;signing&#34;.

She didn't like videos at all.  Before calling it a lost cause I tried again when she was around 12 months.Now, she will not eat a meal without ""baby"".  As a matter-of-fact, this is how we get her to eat an entire meal.  I sit with her and we watch baby signs.  I bought the other two videos (sharing signs and exploring signs) and we rotate them.  She can do most of the signs and understands them and uses them properly.  She is 16 months.  I am happy to say at 42 I can understand and use the signs properly as well...I only gave the video 4 stars because I do think that some of word choices are weird.  Why do we need to know the sign for dinosaur?  I'm sure someone needs it...not us.  However ""hat"" is more useful than I would have thought.  And sharing signs is great with ""please"" and ""thank you"".BOTTOM LINE:  My daughter is engaged and entertained and it probably has helped with her verbal communication as well as her non-verbal communication skills.

838525,A1MFIVHYJS11WY,B0002KJJHI,"Kathy Carrington ""book fiend""","[2, 2]","My daughter (18 months now!) loves this series.  She laughs and claps whenever I put it on.We started showing her the series at about 7 months but she didn't get interested until about 13 months.  I was shocked at how quickly she began making signs at that point.Some reviewers are critical about all the animal signs on this DVD but if you think about it, animals are VERY fascinating to children.  When you show this series to a baby, you aren't just teaching them important words for them to know (eat, milk, more, etc.) but are teaching them the actually concept of words and communication.  Getting them to keep watching by showing the animals and animal signs is helpful.  One of my daughter's first signs was dog and she was thrilled when she realized she had been able to make me understand her.  She learned additional signs rapidly after that breakthrough.Her verbal skills are expanding rapidly at this point but her pronunciation is still horrible - like most toddlers, only mommy and daddy can understand what she says.

838528,A1GOJL8ZS95UKO,B0002KJJHI,Mom Of Many Munchkins,"[4, 4]","This dvd is done very well.  We enjoy it.  My little girl is 18 months old, at the time of writing this, and we have been using Signing Time since she was 9 months.  She already uses quite a bit of signs (about 50).  I knew when I bought this dvd that most of these same signs we learned in Siging Time (Signing Time, by the way, is AWESOME.  We have all 6 dvd's and two music cd's and they are so great!!).  But I wanted another video, in addition to Signing Time, that would be fun for my little girl to watch and practice her signs.  She enjoyed the My Baby Can Talk clip (demo) of ""cat"" at the website so much that I wanted to add this to our growing ASL collection.On the Main Menu there is a Tutorial which is quite informative (especially if you are a beginner).  The first time we watched it, my daughter loved the video.  If it was a sign she knew, she was signing right along.  The pictures and live action are very nice and colorful.  The music is very nice.  The little baby, Jessica, is so adorable.Here's basically how it works:  They show a puppy and then Melissa (the signer on the video) shows the sign.  The word ""puppy"" is also shown on the screen.  Then you have lots of different puppy scenes (real puppies, toy puppies), etc.  Melissa will show the sign three times in all and Jessica (the little girl) signs each word once.  Sometimes there is a child's voice that will add an explanation to the sign.  As an example, for puppy the voice says, ""like you are calling a dog"" while Melissa pats her leg and signs puppy.  Sometimes they explain a sign by showing two outstreached hands (like if it were your hands out in front of you) and they show you how to place your hands for the sign (like for ""drink"", etc).  This was a nice feature, I thought.Jessica is young so she doesn't sign accurately yet.  That's ok.  This helps you see that babies don't have to sign it prefectly.  My baby signs many words that are not accurate yet.  For ""daddy"" she points to her head.  For ""mommy"" she points to her chin.  For ""more"" she touches both pointer fingers together.  In the My Baby Can Talk tutorial they even say that babies can't always do the sign correctly and might point for some signs.  It's just important that you keep signing the correct way and as she grows she will learn it more accurately.  At least you will know what she is talking about until then.Here's a list of the words taught in My Baby Can Talk First Signs (not in this order):bear, bird, book, bunny, butterfly, car, cat, cow, dinosaur, dog, drink, duck, eat, fish, go, horse, milk, more, mouse, shoes.The next dvd in the My Baby Can Talk series, as well as board books and flashcards, will be released later this year.  I look forward to buying more.  This first dvd in the series is nice to add to your ASL signing videos or a great one to have as your first one.  I do like it much better then Baby See N' Sign.  Be sure to check out the My Baby Can Talk website for a really nice online ASL dictionary.  You can also sign up for their free newsletter so you can get a notice when the other products will be available.Just as an added point, we have all 6 Signing Time dvd's and My Baby Can Talk dvd together on a shelf.  Each day I let my daughter choose one of them to watch.  She can go for days and only want to watch baby Jessica of My Baby Can Talk.  She really loves Signing Time also but goes in spurts liking one over the other for awhile.  I have written many other reviews so please read them too.",5,Very nice dvd.

I have seen many signing videos over the last four years, both as a parent and as a professional in the baby signing industry. Upon viewing My Baby Can Talk&trade; - First Signs DVD for the first time, I was very impressed for a number of reasons.For starters, the movie itself is extremely engaging. I have my own little group of testers here in the house (three children) and I gauged their reactions carefully. My little girl, the youngest at 20 months, watched it the whole way through the first time with me by her side. She was able to connect the signs with the images on the screen quite easily with a little help from mom and genuinely enjoyed the footage of the animals the best (the panda having a snack is her favorite). I have not seen my daughter love a movie as much as she loves this one. She wants to watch it every day.I also thought that it is really great to show both an adult as well as a baby signing every sign. This is helpful in more than one way - children get to see another child in their age group signing and they also get to see the sign signed with more precision by an adult. The repetition in the movie is perfect as well as the variety of images shown.

Burman ""orion""","[5, 5]","A rave review!We started our daughter watching the video when she was a little over 5 or 6 months old while I would get ready for work. It kept her interested and occupied and I felt good about it because she was learning something. I then would start showing her signs like Go and Car and Milk and Sleep at that early age.By 9 months old our daughter, Campbell, was able to sign Butterfly and Fish (along with Go, Car and Milk)!  It was amazing. She caught on quite quickly to signing and we all enjoyed immensely!We had a lot of questions of why would teach our daughter to sign. Most people thought it was because she had a hearing problem!! She is now 16 months old and still signing and learning new ones I teach her. I don't think we encountered near the communication issues we would have if my daughter had not learned to sign at an early age. My job now is keep up with her signing!!!Your video is short, educational, easy to learn from and to the point!  I tell all parents about signing and we still get a lot of questions about it and more and more parents seem to be interested and I always steer them towards your videos and website. It has been a huge benefit to our family.
