1696588,A3OPWR72IQ2DN0,B00JEZWQ5O,jpop,"[0, 0]","Finally! I loved this show when it premiered back in 1968.  It was the first program to rotate its lead actors.  It all took place at Howard Publications, a magazine company run by Glenn Howard (Gene Barry).  Other actors included Robert Stack as Dan Farrell, editor of Crime Magazine, and Tony Franciosa as Jeff Dillon, editor of People Magazine (before there ever was a real-life People Magazine).  Susan St. James as Peggy Maxwell, an editorial assistant was a common thread in most all the episodes and sometimes Barry would make an appearance on the other actors&#8217; episodes to maintain continuity. Universal produced the high budget 90 minute series almost as if they were movies for television.  To recoup some of the high production costs each episode was actually released to theatres in Europe as a feature film.  The show was very topical as you would expect and that may be a drawback for some people who will find it outdated.  But the series was innovative in a lot of different ways which makes it worthwhile.  One of the episodes features a modern, greek chorus that would appear between scenes.  Another episode was directed by future superstar director Steven Spielberg and takes place (via dream sequence) in the future.  The stories were all well written and many behind the scenes people (Steven Bochco for example) went on to future success in other shows.  All the episodes featured familiar actors from Universal&#8217;s stable of contract players at the time.  I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing this show again and I hope seasons two and three are not far behind.",5,Underrated Classic,1405987200,"07 22, 2014",2014,1601,"['Finally', 'loved', 'show', 'when', 'premiered', 'back', '1968', 'was', 'first', 'program', 'rotate', 'lead', 'actors', 'took', 'place', 'Howard', 'Publications', 'magazine', 'company', 'run', 'Glenn', 'Howard', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'Other', 'actors', 'included', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'Dan', 'Farrell', 'editor', 'Crime', 'Magazine', 'Tony', 'Franciosa', 'Jeff', 'Dillon', 'editor', 'People', 'Magazine', 'ever', 'was', 'real-life', 'People', 'Magazine', 'Susan', 'St.', 'James', 'Peggy', 'Maxwell', 'editorial', 'assistant', 'was', 'common', 'thread', 'most', 'episodes', 'sometimes', 'Barry', 'would', 'make', 'appearance', 'other', 'actors', '8217', 'episodes', 'maintain', 'continuity', 'Universal', 'produced', 'high', 'budget', '90', 'minute', 'series', 'almost', 'were', 'movies', 'television', 'recoup', 'high', 'production', 'costs', 'episode', 'was', 'actually', 'released', 'theatres', 'Europe', 'feature', 'film', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'topical', 'would', 'expect', 'may', 'be', 'drawback', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'outdated', 'series', 'was', 'innovative', 'lot', 'different', 'ways', 'worthwhile', 'One', 'episodes', 'modern', 'greek', 'chorus', 'would', 'appear', 'scenes', 'episode', 'was', 'directed', 'future', 'superstar', 'director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'place', 'dream', 'sequence', 'future', 'stories', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'many', 'scenes', 'people', 'Steven', 'Bochco', 'example', 'went', 'future', 'success', 'other', 'shows', 'episodes', 'featured', 'familiar', 'actors', 'Universal', '8217', 'stable', 'contract', 'players', 'time', '8217', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'show', 'again', 'hope', 'seasons', 'two', 'three', 'are', 'not', 'far']",The Name Of The Game: Season 1

1696590,A26GVNHGNPV1VW,B00JEZWQ5O,Susan Peterson,"[2, 3]","Thank you Amazon!  I can't believe they did it!  I'm sure I'm not  alone, but I did write to them last month and told them that the baby boomer generation (the still largest consumer group) would love to see this come out on DVD.  I told them that many of us have fond memories of this TV show and would love to see it before we died : ) .  I am ECSTATIC that they finally came through!For those of you too young to have seen this, this was a weekly show featuring one of 3 stars, Gene Barry, Robert Stack, or Tony Franciosa who all worked in some capacity for Howard Publications which produced different magazines.  Franciosa worked for a fictional ""People"" magazine, six years before the real one came out in which he did quite a bit of investigative journalism not too much before Watergate.  The stories are a little dated, of course, and the sets are a little contrived, but, that's okay - it is still a great show!  Watch it for the acting and the ability to time travel back to your youth - the time before cell phones, microwaves, and fax machines. They did have car phones, tape recorders, and the telex machine was the hot form of instant printed communication.  Susan St. James, the assistant, was so great in this series - she was the perfect complement to the revolving stars - intelligent, sunny, and bright!I liked the show because even though it had a sexiness about it, it was still a clean show.  The first episode, ""Fear of High Places,"" is a hoot.  Now, this was before the Women's Liberation movement had a substantial impact on society, so the tone can have a little bit of male superiority.  I cracked up when one of the wives took the blame for her husband's adultery.
