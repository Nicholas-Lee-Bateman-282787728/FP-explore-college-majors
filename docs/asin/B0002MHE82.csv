840828,A4VH04TA14CPE,B0002MHE82,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[35, 60]","For a supposed romantic comedy, this show is tremendously mean-spirited. Its one joke, repeated constantly, is the mistreatment of its protagonist, Keitaro, played for laughs. For half the show, Keitaro is despised by every single inhabitant of the hotel he works in. He's constantly accused of misdeeds, talked down to, beaten up, threatened with death by the sword, and so on. One wonders why he doesn't just leave after two days.Chief among Keitaro's tormentors is Naru, inexplicably also his main romantic interest. She epitomizes what the proverb calls ""a dog that sits upon the hay,"" who neither puts the hay to use nor lets others use it. Whenever Keitaro is with her, she is spiteful toward him for no real reason, and usually beats him up. She appears to genuinely view him as a dangerous pervert, because when they have to sleep in the same room one time, she trembles with terror at the thought of Keitaro groping her in the night. So, it's strange indeed that she should fall in love with him; however, falling in love makes her act even more spitefully. For instance, when she thinks that he's not drooling with lust over her womanly figure enough, she strikes seductive poses and unbuttons her blouse, to make him ogle her, so she can beat him up for being perverted. What the hell? Completing my analogy, when other girls take interest in Keitaro, she tells them that he has no good qualities and isn't worth their time. If anyone goes out with him anyway, Naru attacks Keitaro.To such a woman, one should say, ""Listen, babe, if you want to be cruel, either take up kicking puppies or become a college admissions officer,"" and take one's leave. Instead of doing this, Keitaro grovels in the dirt. As the series progresses, he becomes so browbeaten that he reflexively screams ""I'm sorry!"" whenever he sees Naru. In one episode, when he has doubts about his ""love,"" one dude makes fun of him for ""giving up"" Naru because, he says, Keitaro must have realized that such an unattainable goal was far beyond his abilities. Instead of offering the eminently sensible retort, ""No, it's because she's an emotionally manipulative, shallow little girl,"" Keitaro crawls back to her. Oh, rapture.This setup is presented as a zany romantic comedy, but it's not romantic or funny. If Keitaro really were a scheming pervert, it might be funny, in a ""yee-haw, girl power teaches lustful male a lesson"" sort of way. But his fantasies are completely innocent: he goes through life in search of a girl he knew in his childhood, in order to marry her, so that they may go out on picnics and eat boxed lunches together. He's literally too well-brought-up to be perverted. There's no way a normal person can take pleasure in laughing at him. As for the romance, the show definitely tries to elicit genuine emotional involvement from the viewer at times, but Keitaro's cringing subservience eventually wears out one's sympathy. As for Naru, the show gives her a few flashbacks, to show that she has problems too and thus deserves some compassion, but this would work only if she herself had compassion for anyone.The show is very bad at characterization. At one point, Naru and Keitaro go out for dinner. They enter a restaurant, and immediately the camera cuts to them going outside later, so the plot can advance. If these characters (who are the focus of the entire show, mind you) were actually given an opportunity to unwind and talk to each other at length about whatever suits their fancy, they might have gained depth, and their attraction to each other might have made sense. But they never do this: in fact, it seems like they've nothing whatsoever to say to each other. They have no interests in life. They've no political beliefs or favourite books or bands or films or paintings. They ask no questions about the world; they never wonder what role their lives should play in it. They study now and then, but they don't have any enthusiasm at all for the subjects they study. They are total strangers to each other. Yet the show is four times longer than the typical movie.I admit, the show did improve in its second half, largely thanks to two supporting characters. The first is Mr. Seta, a patient father-figure type who is simultaneously a suave loverman, a master of karate, and a scientist, but who doesn't brag about his many talents or use them to threaten people. The latter quality especially is lacking in the show, so his laid-back attitude was most welcome. The second character is Mutsumi, who likes nature, admits to her numerous foibles, and appreciates the simple joys of life, unlike Naru and most other people in the show. She treats Keitaro like a human being, which in this company is already enough to make her seem like a shimmering saint. She even takes a liking to him, which leads to this encapsulation of the show's failings: At one point, Naru gets enraged over a triviality and punches Keitaro in the face, knocking him down. She storms out, but Mutsumi flies to Keitaro's side and tries to resuscitate him.Anyway, it's easy to root for a kind and affectionate person, however one-dimensional, so I rooted for Mutsumi. A good woman is hard to find, after all. Alas, Keitaro chose Naru, and Mutsumi followed his wishes and gave up her claim on him. Naru beat Keitaro up, they resumed their roles at the hotel as if nothing had taken place between them, and nothing was resolved, probably because the writers wanted to leave themselves an opportunity to write equally shallow sequels later. So, when all's said and done, this is a wearisome, unsympathetic show.",2,"And now, it is time for a dissenting opinion!",1098835200,"10 27, 2004",2004,5591,"['supposed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'show',

840830,AXRWJQX8BYK7C,B0002MHE82,"GrayD ""GrayD""","[1, 2]","after reading so many glowing reviews, i have to admit that i was very underwhelmed with the Love Hina anime (and manga).  i agree with some of Angrymofo's comments and review that is buried somewhere down the comments list.1.  at it's heart, it is a soap opera... who loves who and why.  that in itself is fine except that there is really only 1 main story - keitaro and naru.  and just when keitaro seems to have worked things out with his emotions... all of a sudden, Naru has issues.2.  jokes are constantly repeated.  how many times can we see keitaro getting punched into the air after an inappropriate accident?  first time it was funny but, after the 15th time, it loses some impact.3.  it is a story of insecurity.  every episode is basically someone being insecure.  (eg keitaro fails his test,  naru fails her test, motoko fails her test, shinobu is worried about failing her test...) again, i felt that this was a theme that was way too overdone (and frankly, my sympathy was wearing out b/c the insecurity was so stupid.  arguably, i guess they always are.)  and the plot devices are repetitive - just change the name of the person having the crisis.4.  the characters that i liked the most were the most underdeveloped.  (mutsumi and mitsune).  24 (25) episodes and 3 ovas should be plenty to do more.  the manga does a better job.what started out as an interesting and humorous series gradually turned into a tedious soap opera and one that i wished would just end.  i guess this type of anime is just not my cup of tea.to be fair, there are moments that are quite funny and i had no problems w/ some of the ridiculous events that occur (since i don't expect logic in anime).  the only other humorous anime that i really enjoyed would be... maybe, Azumanga Daioh (5 stars, imo).",3,another dissenting opinion,1189728000,"09 14, 2007",2007,1793,"['reading', 'so', 'many', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'i', 'have', 'admit', 'i', 'was', 'very', 'underwhelmed', 'Love', 'Hina', 'anime', 'manga', 'i', 'agree', 'Angrymofo', 'comments', 'review', 'buried', 'somewhere', 'comments', 'list.1', 'heart', 'soap', 'opera', 'who', 'who', 'why', 'fine', 'really', 'only', '1', 'main', 'story', 'keitaro', 'naru', 'just', 'when', 'keitaro', 'have', 'worked', 'things', 'out', 'emotions', 'sudden', 'Naru', 'issues.2', 'jokes', 'are', 'constantly', 'repeated', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'see', 'keitaro', 'getting', 'punched', 'air', 'inappropriate', 'accident', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'funny', '15th', 'time', 'impact.3', 'story', 'insecurity', 'episode', 'basically', 'someone', 'being', 'insecure', 'eg', 'keitaro', 'test', 'naru', 'test', 'motoko', 'test', 'shinobu', 'worried', 'failing', 'test', 'again', 'i', 'felt', 'was', 'theme', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'overdone', 'frankly', 'sympathy', 'was', 'wearing', 'out', 'insecurity', 'was', 'so', 'stupid', 'arguably', 'i', 'guess', 'always', 'are', 'plot', 'devices', 'are', 'repetitive', 'just', 'change', 'name', 'person', 'having', 'crisis.4', 'characters', 'i', 'liked', 'most', 'were', 'most', 'underdeveloped', 'mutsumi', 'mitsune', '24', '25', 'episodes', '3', 'ovas', 'should', 'be', 'plenty', 'do', 'more', 'manga', 'better', 'started', 'out', 'interesting', 'humorous', 'series', 'gradually', 'turned', 'tedious', 'soap', 'opera', 'one', 'i', 'wished', 'would', 'just', 'end', 'i', 'guess', 'type', 'anime', 'just', 'not', 'cup', 'tea.to', 'be', 'fair', 'are', 'moments', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'i', 'had', 'problems', 'w/', 'ridiculous', 'events', 'occur', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'logic', 'anime', 'only', 'other', 'humorous', 'i', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'would', 'be', 'maybe', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', '5', 'stars', 'imo']",Love Hina - Perfect Collection

840834,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B0002MHE82,trashcanman,"[78, 80]","I have to admit that I was skeptical about an animated romantic comedy series, seeing as how I seldom enjoy live-action romantic comedies.  Still, after having this series recommended to me over and over again I decided to check it out.  I was very pleasantly suprised.  This is simply animatd entertainment at it's finest; great characters, engrossing storyline, hilarious slapstick comedy, over-the-top satire, and some of the most beautiful character designs I've ever seen make this series a no-brainer for all anime fans, and a great introduction to the art form for anime newcomers.  Think of this series as Japan's answer to Friends.  The story revolves around a young man, Keitaro, who becomes the manager of an all-girl apartment complex, Hinata, while working to be accepted to Tokyo University.  You see, as a small child he made a promise to a girl he loved and was forced to move away from that when they were older, they would meet as students at Tokyo U and live happily ever after.  Sure, he doesn't even remember who the girl is, but Keitaro obviously believes fate will guide him.  Also living in Hinata is a wacky cast of female characters; Naru, the object of Keitaro's affection who sports a mean temper and is also working to get into Tokyo U (hmmm...), Su is the lunatic genius of the bunch who is very reminiscent of Ed from Cowboy Bebop, Kitsume is the drunken meddler who views the many conflicts and dramas of the series as her own entertainment, Shinobu is the painfully shy junior high student who comes to stay at the Hianta apartments when her parents get a divorce, and Motoka is a turtle-phobic feminist samurai girl who doesn't take kindly to a male managing an all-girl apartment complex.  Plenty more memorable and (dare I say it?) loveable characters make their mark as the series progresses and the interpersonal dynamics between them never fail to produce hilarious and often touching results.  Keitaro's endeering geekiness as he pursues Naru, Naru sending Keitaro flying with punch after punch, Motoko chasing him with a sword after she catches him apparently peeping, Shinobu's awkwardness with the whole situation,  Su bouncing off the walls and building engines of destruction, Kitsune laying back with a drink in her hand and a big smile on her face as she watches it all go down, great, great stuff. Love Hina has really turned the whole romance-as-comedy genre on it's ear like Ranma 1/2 did back in the day and just went one step further by making the show more believable and emotional, but at the same time amping up the comedy to the ridiculous levels usually associated with shows like Excel Saga.  How they managed to pull this off is beyond me.  They even threw in some genius homages/spoofs to such classic films as Lady Snowblood, Mothra, Godzilla, Ultraman, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, fantasy RPG's in general, and much more. There's even an episode featuring Naru spoofing the whole Japanese pop-star/singer/voice-actress phenomenon which I can't help but see as a jab at the ubiquitous Megumi Hayashibara who has a bit part in the series as Keitaro's aunt Haruka (she also sings the series' theme song).  True anime fans will love this stuff. All in all, you get the original 24 episodes of the television series, the bonus 25th episode (my favorite), the Christmas and Spring movies, and the series finale 3-episode OVA which brings the series to a very satifying close.

840835,A1N8CSUXX07V8,B0002MHE82,Ulysses K. Ang,"[1, 1]","Love Hina came as a surprise for me. As an avid Ranma 1/2 fan, I've always enjoyed an ecclectic mix of action and comedy.  Love Hina is perhaps the first time I've ventured into the realm of pure romantic-comedy.  And this one certainly delivers.  The story is pure silliness with a dash of wit and heart-warming character development.  Although the ""good-natured nerdy guy love/hates beautiful girl"" is certainly a cliche, Love Hina still provides some moments of good fun.  Repeat viewing is certainly possible, although some episodes may drag on more than others (particularly the ""Spring Movie""). This boxed set completes the entire Love Hina series and OAVs in one-shot, and thus, is excellent value.",4,A light-hearted comedy,1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,705,"['Love', 'Hina', 'came', 'surprise', 'avid', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'ecclectic', 'mix', 'action', 'comedy', 'Love', 'Hina', 'perhaps', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'ventured', 'realm', 'pure', 'romantic-comedy', 'one', 'certainly', 'story', 'pure', 'silliness', 'dash', 'wit', 'heart-warming', 'character', 'development', 'good-natured', 'nerdy', 'guy', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'certainly', 'cliche', 'Love', 'Hina', 'still', 'moments', 'good', 'fun', 'Repeat', 'viewing', 'certainly', 'possible', 'episodes', 'may', 'drag', 'more', 'others', 'particularly', 'Spring', 'Movie', 'boxed', 'set', 'entire', 'Love', 'Hina', 'series', 'OAVs', 'one-shot', 'thus', 'excellent', 'value']",Love Hina - Perfect Collection
