231370,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300267865,Acute Observer,"[4, 17]","The 'Overture' shows the sea coast for 3 minutes. This story takes place in 1917 California. A woman walks to deposit money in a bank in Monterey. The dirt road shows horses are in use. A young man follows this woman (he is bare-headed). Why does he follow Kate? [Perhaps you need to read the book first.] Cal returns to Salinas and meets his brother Aaron. [The hair style is from the 1950s, not 1917.] Their father Adam plans to buy an ice house to ship his vegetables under refrigeration to a distant markets. Is Cal thoughtless or scary? Can people relax in an ice house? Cal's troubled soul is shown by his dumping ice. Why is he bad, unlike his twin brother? Restless Cal returns to Monterey and visits that house. He gets into trouble and meets the sheriff. Is Kate the reason why Cal is ""bad""?Aaron's girlfriend Abra tells Cal about her past, and her stepmother. [This conversation seems pointless, except as a clue to confused thinking.] The shipment of lettuce is a big event in those days. But snow blockaded the pass, the lettuce shipment was ruined. Cal wants to raise beans; war is good for business. They will pay farmers to plant beans at 5 cents a pound and do all the work, then they will sell them for 10 cents a pound. Cal knows where he can get the money. Kate knows how to do business: other people do the work and she profits. The Great War has an affect on Salinas. Cal shows his skill at the shooting gallery. We see the carnival that entertained people in simpler times.Steinbeck's story tells how people's emotions are stirred to turn on a neighbor. The this leads to conflict between Cal and Aaron (a long simmering competition?). Cal has plans for a birthday party for his father. [Do you sense this will be a disaster?] Adam doesn't want the money raised by speculating in beans. Cal takes this hard. [Do his actions repeat in his other films?] This leads to a revelation about their long absent mother.The ending seems incredible to me, however necessary to this particular story. Its like a deck of cards being rigged to fix the result. This story warns against hiding family scandals from grown children. I wonder if this would be a better film if made in a different time? The novel must be much better than this film.",2,A Story of Family Conflicts,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,2252,"[""'Overture"", 'sea', 'coast', '3', 'minutes', 'story', 'place', '1917', 'California', 'woman', 'deposit', 'money', 'bank', 'Monterey', 'dirt', 'road', 'horses', 'are', 'use', 'young', 'man', 'woman', 'bare-headed', 'Why', 'follow', 'Kate', '[', 'Perhaps', 'need', 'read', 'book', 'first', ']', 'Cal', 'returns', 'Salinas', 'brother', 'Aaron', '[', 'hair', 'style', '1950s', 'not', '1917', ']', 'father', 'Adam', 'buy', 'ice', 'house', 'ship', 'vegetables', 'refrigeration', 'distant', 'markets', 'Cal', 'thoughtless', 'scary', 'Can', 'people', 'relax', 'ice', 'house', 'Cal', 'troubled', 'soul', 'shown', 'dumping', 'ice', 'Why', 'bad', 'twin', 'brother', 'Restless', 'Cal', 'returns', 'Monterey', 'visits', 'house', 'trouble', 'sheriff', 'Kate', 'reason', 'why', 'Cal', 'bad', 'Aaron', 'girlfriend', 'Abra', 'Cal', 'past', 'stepmother', '[', 'conversation', 'pointless', 'clue', 'confused', 'thinking', ']', 'shipment', 'lettuce', 'big', 'event', 'days', 'snow', 'blockaded', 'pass', 'lettuce', 'shipment', 'was', 'ruined', 'Cal', 'raise', 'beans', 'war', 'good', 'business', 'will', 'pay', 'farmers', 'plant', 'beans', '5', 'cents', 'pound', 'do', 'work', 'then', 'will', 'sell', '10', 'cents', 'pound', 'Cal', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'money', 'Kate', 'how', 'do', 'business', 'other', 'people', 'do', 'work', 'profits', 'Great', 'War', 'affect', 'Salinas', 'Cal', 'skill', 'shooting', 'gallery', 'see', 'carnival', 'entertained', 'people', 'simpler', 'times.Steinbeck', 'story', 'how', 'people', 'emotions', 'are', 'stirred', 'turn', 'neighbor', 'conflict', 'Cal', 'Aaron', 'long', 'simmering', 'competition', 'Cal', 'plans', 'birthday', 'party', 'father', '[', 'Do', 'sense', 'will', 'be', 'disaster', ']', 'Adam', ""n't"", 'want', 'money', 'raised', 'speculating', 'beans', 'Cal', 'hard', '[', 'Do', 'actions', 'repeat', 'other', 'films', ']', 'revelation', 'long', 'absent', 'mother.The', 'ending', 'incredible', 'however', 'necessary', 'particular', 'story', 'deck', 'cards', 'being', 'rigged', 'fix', 'result', 'story', 'hiding', 'family', 'scandals', 'grown', 'children', 'wonder', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'film', 'made', 'different', 'time', 'novel', 'must', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'film']",N/A

231374,AGEIT17HENDIS,6300267865,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 1]","This entry was originally posted as a review of the book by John Steinbeck but other than to note the outstanding performances by Dean, Harris and Massey (and small role by Burl Ives) the point made there apply here on the film adaptation.I usually do not read the comments of book reviewers on Amazon.com (or, in a few cases, at least not until after I have written my own). I was, however, interested in finding out whether Steinbeck and his tale still held interest for today's readers. The answer seems to be yes. Moreover, I was interested in what other people had to say about the symbolic nature of the clash between and among generations of brothers and its relationship to the old biblical struggles going back to the `first family'.Damn, life has definitely been tougher since the `fall'. The morale to be derived from Steinbeck's novel is, apparently, that while the `fall of man' under the spell of earthly temptations had its down side humankind is better for the struggle. A strong argument can moreover be made that without that struggle by fallen humankind no serious progress would have been made.  That struggle is epitomized by the characters, tensions and actions of the two brothers (in both generations ,Adam's the father's and Aaron's and the son's) which makes me think that Steinbeck may see this an eternal struggle and that we are endlessly doomed to roll that rock up the hill just to have it come crashing back down on us.Those who have only seen the 1950's movie version of this novel starring, among others, the ill-fated James Dean and a young Julie Harris, have missed some great writing about the effects of the destruction, struggle to rebuilt and attempts at redemption in the wake of the fall of Adam Trask and his struggle to change his ways. And through him, his sons. The movie (that I saw long before reading the book) skips over the compelling first section which deals with the seemingly pre-ordained destruction of Adam, by his `wife' among others. Moreover, in the movie the demonic role of the `wife' Kathy is glossed over (probably due to the less tolerate and more squeamish mores about `fallen women' in the 1950's). She is not a `nice' person.

Munnik ""firewatcher""","[3, 4]","I have enjoyed East of Eden several times over a time span of some forty years; first in black and white on a small TV and later in colour but still in small screen format. So I looked very much forward to the new DVD release in its original format.The DVD package is certainly handsome with many welcome bonuses.Of particular interest is a short screen test segment featuring the two brothers in an intense dramatic confrontation. This revived memories of my first viewing of this classic and made me realize that the nature of this film would have been more suited to the 4:3, black and white format of previous Kazan helmed masterpieces such as A Street Car Named Desire and On the Waterfront.Kazan was not the only great director to experience teething problems with the recently (1954) introduced gimmick of Cinemascope. But the Studios, convinced that this was the way to woo potential audiences away from their TV sets, cajoled their leading directors to turn out major productions in this format irregardless of aesthetic suitabilities.No director has ever surpassed Kazan in capturing intense emotional confrontations between individuals, and the focus this requires is diluted and diminished by the widescreen format. Kazan does throw in some fine panoramic vistas of the stunning filming locales, but these are only fleeting moments that are not really central to the unfolding drama. Kazan skews camera angles in an attempt to add tension, but just plain old black and white and a more confined screen space would have been more effective ways to concentrate the action.Some viewers will probably grouse at the somewhat muted colour transfer, but this film was shot in WarnerColor (synonymous with Ansco Color) which the studios used for several years in order to shave costs. Unlike Technicolor, this was a one step colour processing that was both inferior and highly unstable. Restoring films shot in this colour format is quite a herculean achievement and  they never equal the vibrancy of older films recorded in three step Technicolor.East of Eden is still a terrific cinematic achievement, but it would have been more powerful still if it had been shot in black and white small screen.",4,Kazan Struggles Mightily With Cinemascope,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,2203,"['have', 'enjoyed', 'East', 'Eden', 'several', 'times', 'time', 'span', 'forty', 'years', 'first', 'black', 'white', 'small', 'TV', 'later', 'colour', 'still', 'small', 'screen', 'format', 'looked', 'very', 'much', 'forward', 'new', 'DVD', 'release', 'original', 'format.The', 'DVD', 'package', 'certainly', 'handsome', 'many', 'welcome', 'bonuses.Of', 'particular', 'interest', 'short', 'screen', 'test', 'segment', 'featuring', 'two', 'brothers', 'intense', 'dramatic', 'confrontation', 'revived', 'memories', 'first', 'viewing', 'classic', 'made', 'realize', 'nature', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'suited', '4:3', 'black', 'white', 'format', 'previous', 'Kazan', 'helmed', 'masterpieces', 'such', 'A', 'Street', 'Car', 'Named', 'Desire', 'Waterfront.Kazan', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'director', 'experience', 'teething', 'problems', 'recently', '1954', 'introduced', 'gimmick', 'Cinemascope', 'Studios', 'convinced', 'was', 'way', 'woo', 'potential', 'audiences', 'away', 'TV', 'sets', 'cajoled', 'leading', 'directors', 'turn', 'out', 'major', 'productions', 'format', 'irregardless', 'aesthetic', 'suitabilities.No', 'director', 'ever', 'surpassed', 'Kazan', 'capturing', 'intense', 'emotional', 'confrontations', 'individuals', 'focus', 'diluted', 'diminished', 'widescreen', 'format', 'Kazan', 'throw', 'fine', 'panoramic', 'vistas', 'stunning', 'filming', 'locales', 'are', 'only', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'central', 'unfolding', 'drama', 'Kazan', 'camera', 'angles', 'attempt', 'add', 'tension', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'more', 'confined', 'screen', 'space', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'ways', 'concentrate', 'action.Some', 'viewers', 'will', 'probably', 'grouse', 'somewhat', 'muted', 'colour', 'transfer', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'WarnerColor', 'synonymous', 'Ansco', 'Color', 'studios', 'used', 'several', 'years', 'order', 'shave', 'costs', 'Technicolor', 'was', 'one', 'step', 'colour', 'processing', 'was', 'inferior', 'highly', 'unstable', 'Restoring', 'films', 'shot', 'colour', 'format', 'quite', 'herculean', 'achievement', 'never', 'equal', 'vibrancy', 'older', 'films', 'recorded', 'three', 'step', 'Technicolor.East', 'Eden', 'still', 'terrific', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'powerful', 'still', 'had', 'been', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'small', 'screen']",N/A

PicturesAndrew&#8217;s Blu-ray Review - East of Eden is based upon the acclaimed novel written by John Steinbeck. It was adapted for the screen by Paul Osborn. This production of the book was a gigantic undertaking for its makers, both in terms of what the director and studio brought to the production. Warner Bros helped make East of Eden one of the first films to be made in CinemaScope, a technology meant to pioneer widescreen filmmaking.Directed by acclaimed filmmaker Elia Kazan [On the Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire] and introducing the young James Dean to the film-going public this is one of the greatest of Kazan's accomplishments, who was at his absolute best with this masterpiece.  He helped to bring forth Dean's electrifying performance, which to this day still stand's as one of the best debut performances by an actor in a feature film.James Dean actually got his start in small bit-parts on television programs before landing the big role in East of Eden, which catapulted his career quickly and helped to make him a star. This role is the launching pad that led him to getting the roles in Rebel Without a Cause and Giant that would so closely follow. It was also the only film of the three he made that Dean was able to see complete prior to release.I've never actually read the John Steinbeck&#8217;s East of Eden novel, though the film version by Elia Kazan, as adapted by Paul Osborn, is supposedly only loosely based upon the second half of the book, so those who love the novel might find some issues with this film. Yet I find this story mesmerizing and profound.It is at least partially a narrative retelling of Cain and Abel. The storyline in East of Eden focuses primarily upon Cal [James Dean], who feels that his love for his father is being rejected and that his father, Adam [Raymond Massey] cares more for his other son Aron [Richard Davalos].  His father is a highly religious man and Cal feels that he cannot live up to his father's idealism. As the storyline progresses, Aron are in a relationship with Abra [Julie Harris] that Cal is jealous about as he has feelings for his brother's girlfriend. Abra, who at first seems to dislike Cal, eventually grows to feel attracted to him.Abra and Cal begin to spend some time together and they ultimately connect over the feelings they have felt under their upbringing. Abra sees the disappointment and pain Cal feels in not pleasing his father, and in feeling a lack of love. Abra tells Cal about how her own father had given her gifts of great monetary value, but was not there for her and that it made her feel she wasn't loved. This scene, set by the backdrop a beautiful field of golden flowers, is one of the most affecting and profound of the film.At the start of the story, Cal believed his mother to be dead. Later in the story he discovers she actually is still alive but that his father had been telling Cal and Aron otherwise for all of their years without her. He seeks finding his mother, and when he succeeds he meets Kate [Jo Van Fleet], who Cal discovers runs a brothel. Kate seems to connect to the fact Cal feels rejected from Adam. Cal, still desperate for his father's affection, asks to borrow money from Kate in hoping to sell beans during a war-time shortage so that he can repay his father for ice that he destroyed, belonging to his father. Reluctantly, Kate agrees to loan Cal the money to get this started. Jo Van Fleet won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her performance demonstrated the icily cold character of Kate, who Cal fails to realise never looked for him or Aron during all of their years apart.The conclusion of the film is one that unfolds with brilliant pacing and some of Elia Kazan's most impressive framing of the characters. One of the things I appreciate about East of Eden, after how wonderful the performances are, is the nightmarish fervour that Elia Kazan creates with tilted camera angles and bizarre framing that most directors would ignore. This makes the descent Cal's feeling emotional seems to be represented through the ebb and flow of the camera.East of Eden is a genuine American classic.  When you think of films with great performances this is a film that easily comes to mind. Dean is so fantastic and so unafraid to be emotionally resonant, that it's shocking to recognize it as a film debut. The supporting performance are so powerful as well, especially the supporting part by Julie Harris, which is so distinct when it's compared to her other performances. I love East of Eden - it's one of the first films that was influential on my growing love of cinema and the power of filmmaking. It is a fine work of accomplished art that is worth cherishing and remembering for all of its immense worth and contribution towards the craft of filmmaking. It is truly an amazing tour-de-force, with brilliant characters.Blu-ray Video Quality - The 1080p image transfer of East of Eden is a strong one indeed. The image retains adequate grain and there is a real sense of richness in the texture of the photography. I certainly find this to be a beautiful film, one with a complex visual quality that is astonishing, largely due to the stylistic choices of Kazan and cinematographer Ted McCord. The original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.55:1 has been preserved. The scope ratio effectively helps Kazan create a larger sense of the 'mood' in many of the scenes, especially when he makes things topsy-turvy during the story's darker moments.The CinemaScope format preserves the film as accurately as possible. This is one of the first films to use the widescreen technology of the time and in that regard it should be considered a pioneering effort. However, I find the use of CinemaScope in East of Eden to be disappointing in comparison to how Rebel Without a Cause implemented it and only shortly thereafter. The only real issue with the film is that the scene-change dissolves have some weak detail due to the source limitations. This is not a fault of Warner Bros or the restoration team at MPI, but it's nonetheless something that has an impact on the visual finesse of the presentation. This minor drawback aside, East of Eden looks stellar in an authentic and well-realised Blu-ray transfer which dramatically demonstrates the importance of film restoration and 4K scanning when preserving films.Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; East of Eden has received the least impressive sound presentation out of the three films. Unfortunately, the re-mixed 5.1 DTS-HD Master audio sounded a bit unnatural to me at times. Take, for instance, the sequence involving the falling blocks of ice as ruined by an outraged Cal. This scene was particularly troublesome to me as it sounded like an inauthentic expansion to 5.1 surround. The way the sound materials were utilized in this moment (and to a lesser degree some other parts of the film) made it a slightly less enveloping experience. I found it a bit distracting to my viewing. Dialogue clarity is good. The music score by Leonard Rosenman sounds beautiful and very haunting when it needs to be but also uplifting when the story and performances are in need of some emotional grace.Blu-ray Supplements and Extras:Commentary by film critic Richard Schickel: Film critic Schickel discusses the film as a fan who has seen it many times, but his commentary lacks the detailed presentation that one might expect from a scholar like Jeffrey Vance. Most of Schickel's historical points (e.g., the animosity between Dean and Massey) are covered in the &#34;Art in Search of Life&#34; feature. His primary contribution in the commentary is an evaluation of the performances and direction.Forever James Dean [1 Hour] This 1988 documentary narrated by Bob Gunton is valuable primarily for its compilation of archival photographs and interviews with childhood acquaintances and other interview subjects who are probably no longer alive. But one doesn't get a strong sense of who Dean was or what made him distinctive.East of Eden: Art in Search of Life [20 minutes] is a documentary with interviews with various individuals who were involved with the making of East of Eden. This documentary short was made in 2005 for Warner's two-disc special edition DVD. It includes informative interviews with Steinbeck's son, Thomas, and Susan Schillinglaw of the Center for Steinbeck Studies, as well as Schickel, Kazan, Harris and others (many via archive footage).Screen Tests [6:21 minute] In the former domain, we get screen tests between James Dean and Richard Davalos as they perform the discussion between Cal and Aron that we already saw as a deleted scene. It&#8217;s a decent titbit, though it&#8217;s too bad we don&#8217;t see some of the other existing screen tests as well.Wardrobe Tests: Richard Davalos [3:27 minutes]; James Dean and Richard Davalos [3:57 minutes]; James Dean, Julie Harris and Richard Davalos [2:21 minutes]; James Dean and Lois Smith [3:09 minutes]; Lois Smith [2:55 minutes]; James Dean and Jo Van Fleet [0:41 seconds]; Jo Van Fleet [4:21 minutes] and Costumes and Production Design [1:38 minutes].Deleted Scenes [19:15 minutes] It presents a conversation between Cal and Aron about their father&#8217;s feelings and more of the birthday party for Adam. We get multiple takes of the various shots, so don&#8217;t expect a full slate of new material. Nothing revealing appears in the party scenes, but the chat between Cal and Aron works well. It fleshes out Cal&#8217;s character change and might have been a useful addition to the film.3/9/55 NYC Premiere (Vintage Featurette) [14:42 miutes] This mostly focuses on the activities in front of the theatre. Host Martin Block chats with the following notables as they enter: Margaret Truman, Milton Berle, John Steinbeck, Elia Kazan, Raymond Massey, Eva Marie Saint, Red Buttons, Jack Warner, Denise Darcell, Imogene Coca, Carol Channing, and Joel Grey. Of course, virtually nothing of substance occurs, but it&#8217;s a fun piece to watch. I particularly like Steinbeck&#8217;s very uncomfortable conversation; the author doesn&#8217;t look happy to be there.Theatrical Trailer [2:54 minutes] What's notable about the trailer is how much effort has been made to sensationalize the story.Finally, it is so marvellous to finally have this classic Elia Kazan film in 1080p High Definition. Despite the technical limitations of early CinemaScope filming East of Eden is a marvellous film to experience. The cinematography and the colours look tremendous in the presentation MPI have created in restoring the film. James Dean is fantastic in this first big-screen performance. This essential film has never been presented better on Home Theatre media and this release is an essential purchase for fans of classic cinema at its finest and that is why I am so proud to add this brilliant Limited DigiBook, as not only is it beautiful produced, but it is also so brilliant to added another James Dean Classic Film to my Blu-ray Collection.

231379,A2O7MOWVMSKO5J,6300267865,Andy Gill,"[13, 14]","It seems odd to me that Nicholas Ray's `Rebel Without A Cause' is the movie that everyone thinks of in association with James Dean, when `East of Eden' is by far the better film in terms of acting, direction, cinematography and story line. What is also odd is how director Kazan created such a sensitive and compassionate movie with incredible depth of understanding when he regarded both James Dean and main character Cal as ""self-pitying, self-dramatizing good-for-nothings"". But then nothing about the phenomena surrounding James Dean makes sense, and so the underlying irony of this film, and the obvious tensions it brought to the production that enhanced the emotions onscreen, is perhaps to be merited.Dean's first, and greatest, big screen outing is a masterpiece of intrigue, emotion and style, in which our heart breaks as often as the chief protagaonist's, misunderstood, unloved Cal. The tension between father-figure Massey and black-sheep Dean, reportedly a dislike that existed off-set and was exploited by Kazan, is a fully-realised element that is as powerful as it is heart-rending. Dean plays the archetypal rebel with much more soul than he would later bring to the role of Jim Stark, and our empathy with the character as he tries to win his father's affections despite knowing he is bad is what makes this movie so remarkable. With Cal we feel the hope and expectation, the suspense and anxiety, and with him we feel the hurt and confusion as good-natured brother Aron steals his father's love time and time again. I would defy anyone who claims that they can watch the scene in which Cal gives his father his birthday present without riding a rollercoaster of emotions that begin with longing, move through dejection, sink to tragically futile hope, and then end in bitter despair. It is perhaps one of the most powerful scenes of any Classical Hollywood film, and most certainly Dean's finest moment in his unfortunately short career.Obviously, `East of Eden' has to trim back from Steinbeck's far-reaching novel, but it is a tight, concise and infinitely moving adaptation. Dean's portrayal aside, the acting all round is incredibly strong; even minor characters who have perhaps a minute of screen time leave a lasting impression on the viewer. Added to this, an emotive score, an involving story, high-quality camerawork and stunning scenery set in and around the Salinas Valley area of California make `East of Eden' something to be treasured, a work of immeasurable historical and emotional value, and a movie that truly lives up to the poignant and idealised James Dean legend.",5,Even after 50 years it has the power to hurt,975283200,"11 27, 2000",2000,2607,"['odd', 'Nicholas', 'Ray', 'Rebel', 'A', 'Cause', 'movie', 'everyone', 'thinks', 'association', 'James', 'Dean', 'when', 'East', 'Eden', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'terms', 'acting', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'story', 'line', 'What', 'also', 'odd', 'how', 'director', 'Kazan', 'created', 'sensitive', 'compassionate', 'movie', 'incredible', 'depth', 'understanding', 'when', 'regarded', 'James', 'Dean', 'main', 'character', 'Cal', 'self-pitying', 'self-dramatizing', 'good-for-nothings', 'then', 'nothing', 'phenomena', 'surrounding', 'James', 'Dean', 'sense', 'so', 'underlying', 'irony', 'film', 'obvious', 'tensions', 'brought', 'production', 'enhanced', 'emotions', 'onscreen', 'perhaps', 'be', 'first', 'greatest', 'big', 'screen', 'outing', 'masterpiece', 'intrigue', 'emotion', 'style', 'heart', 'as', 'often', 'chief', 'protagaonist', 'misunderstood', 'unloved', 'Cal', 'tension', 'father-figure', 'Massey', 'black-sheep', 'Dean', 'reportedly', 'dislike', 'existed', 'off-set', 'was', 'exploited', 'Kazan', 'fully-realised', 'element', 'as', 'powerful', 'heart-rending', 'Dean', 'archetypal', 'rebel', 'much', 'more', 'soul', 'would', 'later', 'bring', 'role', 'Jim', 'Stark', 'empathy', 'character', 'win', 'father', 'affections', 'knowing', 'bad', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'remarkable', 'Cal', 'feel', 'hope', 'expectation', 'suspense', 'anxiety', 'feel', 'hurt', 'confusion', 'good-natured', 'brother', 'Aron', 'father', 'love', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'would', 'defy', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'watch', 'scene', 'Cal', 'father', 'birthday', 'present', 'riding', 'rollercoaster', 'emotions', 'begin', 'longing', 'move', 'dejection', 'sink', 'tragically', 'futile', 'hope', 'then', 'end', 'bitter', 'despair', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'Classical', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'most', 'certainly', 'Dean', 'finest', 'moment', 'unfortunately', 'short', 'career.Obviously', 'East', 'Eden', 'trim', 'back', 'Steinbeck', 'far-reaching', 'novel', 'tight', 'concise', 'infinitely', 'moving', 'adaptation', 'Dean', 'portrayal', 'aside', 'acting', 'round', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'even', 'minor', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'perhaps', 'minute', 'screen', 'time', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'viewer', 'Added', 'emotive', 'score', 'involving', 'story', 'high-quality', 'camerawork', 'stunning', 'scenery', 'set', 'Salinas', 'Valley', 'area', 'California', 'make', 'East', 'Eden', 'something', 'be', 'treasured', 'work', 'immeasurable', 'historical', 'emotional', 'value', 'movie', 'truly', 'up', 'poignant', 'idealised', 'James', 'Dean', 'legend']",N/A
231380,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,6300267865,Anthony L.,"[0, 0]","James Dean acted in only 3 movies in his short career:Rebel Without A Cause, East of Eden, andGiant. He died at the age of 24 in a car crash, and, like most icons taken from us too early (See: Heath Ledger), passed into pop culture immortality. Effortlessly cool, the essence of counterculture, beautiful, attractive to both sexes, and a phenomenal actor, James Dean had a long and lustrous career ahead of him, but tragically left us only three films. But they are three brilliant films.Though East of Eden is less than the sum of it's parts, though it would lose half it's power if the brilliant Dean did not act in it, it is a classic among film because of the figure that strides it like a colossus: James Byron Dean. His stage presence, his emotion, his tough exterior but complex mind mark him as one of cinema's truly great actors. And East of Eden, directed by the incomparable Elia Kazan (On the Waterfront) is truly amazing classic of a film. 4.2 stars.",5,James Dean is brilliant in Kazan's East of Eden.,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,963,"['James', 'Dean', 'acted', 'only', '3', 'movies', 'short', 'career', 'Rebel', 'A', 'Cause', 'East', 'Eden', 'andGiant', 'died', 'age', '24', 'car', 'crash', 'most', 'icons', 'taken', 'too', 'early', 'See', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'passed', 'pop', 'culture', 'immortality', 'Effortlessly', 'cool', 'essence', 'counterculture', 'beautiful', 'attractive', 'sexes', 'phenomenal', 'actor', 'James', 'Dean', 'had', 'long', 'lustrous', 'career', 'ahead', 'tragically', 'left', 'only', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'three', 'brilliant', 'East', 'Eden', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'would', 'lose', 'half', 'power', 'brilliant', 'Dean', 'did', 'not', 'act', 'classic', 'film', 'figure', 'colossus', 'James', 'Byron', 'Dean', 'stage', 'presence', 'emotion', 'tough', 'exterior', 'complex', 'mind', 'mark', 'one', 'cinema', 'truly', 'great', 'actors', 'East', 'Eden', 'directed', 'incomparable', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'Waterfront', 'truly', 'amazing', 'classic', 'film', '4.2', 'stars']",N/A
231381,A3BIWTN2DA0YY2,6300267865,Antoinette Klein,"[35, 42]","I knew James Dean was a tremendous actor when I saw him in &quot;Rebel Without A Cause&quot; and &quot;Giant,&quot; but the depth of his abilities is most obviously showcased in the classic &quot;East of Eden.&quot;  This film is a modern retelling of the Biblical tale of Cain and Abel.  Two brothers, one good and one bad, vie for the love of their father.  Dean portrays Cal Trask, the rebellious loner sternly rejected by the father who adores Cal's twin, the clean-cut model son Aron.  The age-old story of sibling rivalry achieves new dimension through the brilliant direction of Elia Kazan who intended the &quot;evil&quot; brother to the more appealing one.  Dean's anithero is indeed appealing, in scene after scene of his amazing big screen debut.  Whether sabatoging his father's newly-purchased ice house or in his heart-wrenching pleas for love, his emotional performance as the black sheep of the family makes it clear why James Dean will forever be America's legendary rebellious teen.  The rest of the cast is exceptional:  Raymond Massey as the father, Julie Harris as the ideal girl who loves both brothers, Richard Davolos as the good brother, Burl Ives as the family friend, and Jo Van Fleet in her brief but Academy-award-winning performance as the mother.Based on the book by John Steinbeck, the title comes from the Book of Genesis where we are told that after killing his brother, Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.",5,James Dean in His Most Sensuous and Powerful Role,993254400,"06 23, 2001",2001,1494,"['knew', 'James', 'Dean', 'was', 'tremendous', 'actor', 'when', 'saw', 'quot', 'Rebel', 'A', 'Cause', 'quot', 'quot', 'Giant', 'quot', 'depth', 'abilities', 'most', 'obviously', 'showcased', 'classic', 'quot', 'East', 'Eden.', 'quot', 'film', 'modern', 'retelling', 'Biblical', 'tale', 'Cain', 'Abel', 'Two', 'brothers', 'one', 'good', 'one', 'bad', 'vie', 'love', 'father', 'Dean', 'Cal', 'Trask', 'rebellious', 'loner', 'sternly', 'rejected', 'father', 'who', 'Cal', 'twin', 'clean-cut', 'model', 'son', 'Aron', 'age-old', 'story', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'new', 'dimension', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'who', 'intended', 'quot', 'quot', 'brother', 'more', 'appealing', 'one', 'Dean', 'anithero', 'indeed', 'appealing', 'scene', 'scene', 'amazing', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'sabatoging', 'father', 'newly-purchased', 'ice', 'house', 'heart-wrenching', 'pleas', 'love', 'emotional', 'performance', 'black', 'sheep', 'family', 'clear', 'why', 'James', 'Dean', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'America', 'legendary', 'rebellious', 'teen', 'rest', 'cast', 'exceptional', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'father', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'ideal', 'girl', 'who', 'brothers', 'Richard', 'Davolos', 'good', 'brother', 'Burl', 'family', 'friend', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'brief', 'Academy-award-winning', 'performance', 'mother.Based', 'book', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'title', 'Book', 'Genesis', 'where', 'are', 'told', 'killing', 'brother', 'Cain', 'went', 'out', 'presence', 'Lord', 'settled', 'land', 'Nod', 'east', 'Eden']",N/A

It was also James Dean's (as Cal) debut on film, and as this misunderstood and tormented youth he captured a lot of attention, with much comparison being made to Marlon Brando - though Brando mined this field with much more bravura, mesmerism, and talent. (Where Brando would be on fire and seem truly dangerous, Dean was just moody.)Raymond Massey plays the Bible-spouting father, full of what's right but incapable of showing love or compassion, and Richard Davalos is Aaron, who takes after his father. Dean is desperate for his father's love, and when his father's attempt to ship refrigerated lettuce (a new concept - the year is 1917) fails and he loses a lot of money, Dean borrows money from his long-lost mother, now a prostitute, to plant beans. With WW I raging in Europe, beans go sky high, and Dean makes enough money to give his father what he lost - but his father rejects it for pious reasons (""dirty"" money earned off a killing enterprise: war). Dean takes his anger out on Aaron by revealing their mother to him (he believed his father's story that she was dead).The movie starts out slow, but soon the story and the conflicts develop and we become absorbed in the proceedings. Dean, of course, is the actor who made the biggest sensation here, but Davalos is also excellent and Jo Van Fleet took an Oscar in her role as the mother, Kate. An excellent production, and a great job by director Kazan. Definitely worth a watch.

Here he's in a dynamic face-off with his thespic opposite - the classically trained Raymond Massey, as the father. They play off one another brilliantly. Massey seems genuinely perplexed by the eccentric Dean whose off-screen antics matched those on film. Fortunately, this combination deepens the movie's core, resulting in an uncommon emotional powerhouse, driven by Dean's intense expressive yearning. Brilliant too, is Julie Harris, still looking like a teenager at thirty. Watch her scenes with Dean, especially in the farm field, where she too appears fascinated with Dean, the person. Again, the results are electric. (Whatever happened to Dean's movie brother, that credible performer, Richard Davalos, whose subsequent career appears blighted by the shadow of genius.) Often overlooked but contributing greatly - Leonard Rosenman's fine dramatic score, alternately lyrical then jarring in the manner of the movie itself, and Jo Van Fleet's commanding turn, her scenes the only ones Kazan's camera does not allow Dean to dominate. The film has many emotional highlights, not including an over-wrought closing. Despite the latter, it's an intensity that endures.

Nevertheless, some great reviews and a stellar cast gave me hope.The movie centers around Cal, played by James Dean, and his struggle to understand his ""bad"" nature compared to his brother Aron's good nature. The opening scenes show Cal tracking down a woman in a seedy location on the edge of Monterey, CA. Cal's frustrations fester in the atmosphere of his father's well-meaning self-righteousness, and he lets this bitterness harm his relationships with his brother and his brother's girlfriend. Family secrets begin to surface, and he is forced to face his and his parents' past.The acting is superb, although some of the music and drama feel a bit overdone by today's standards. It's no wonder James Dean is so iconic, considering his poise, brooding demeanor, and sharp looks. And the woman who plays Kate, Cal's mother, does well in her role. These performances make it an interesting film, but they cannot overcome the liberties it takes with its source material.As a movie, ""East of Eden"" is a carved-up offering of the book. The book, admittedly, would require a three-hour spectacle to capture even half of its depth and content, but it seems odd that some of the most effective elements Steinbeck delivered--Adam's early and latter confrontations with his wife; and the revealing dialogue with the Chinese servant--are cut completely. The film is a quarter-pound slice from a 16 oz. steak, only a portion of the literary ""East of Eden."" Many of the emotions and tensions I experienced while reading never even surfaced in the film.Despite good intentions and strong acting, this is one movie I wish had been given a sequel, or been renamed so as not to mislead the book's devotees.

231405,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,6300267865,Get What We Give,"[54, 59]","Elia Kazan's ""East of Eden"" is based on the John Steinbeck novel of the same name.  It is a modern tale of Kane and Abel.While the film is certainly fantastic, probably its greatest claim to fame is that it was James Dean's first film.  It is rare, today, that we see a novice young actor (remember Dean was only 22 when this movie was made) secure a leading role in a high profile drama - as this was - and then nail it so well that critics everywhere fell under his spell.  Prior to this film, Dean had only made a handful of commericials, television appearances, and one or two worthwhile theatrical roles.In an era when ""screenplay"" meant acting for the screen and playing it for the last row, Dean, Clift, and (personally, regrettably) Brando, were the only actors out there playing for reality.Dean's Cal is a tortured youth, who has never won his strict father's (the formidable Raymond Massey) acceptance and desperately seeks to do so.  His brother, Aaron (played by Dick Davalos), is obviously favored by the father and this further salts the wounds that Cal carries.  Julie Harris plays Aaron's fiance as a fawning and often obsequious girl, which can be a bit more than off putting at times.Joan Van Fleet portrays Cal and Aaron's ""dead"" mother.  Rather than suffer the embarrassment of admitting his failures as a husband, father, and man, the boys' father tells them and everyone else that their mother long ago died.  In truth she has been running a bordello in the next town.Through a series of machinations, Cal meets his mother, and asks for her assistance in winning over his father.  The plot fails miserably for Cal, setting off a chain of events from which no one can return.Dean's performance - the only one to be seen while he was alive - registered off the Richter scale with the youth of the 1950's.  Never before had they seen someone their age portray someone their age in such a believable manner.  He became an instant star.As is typical, Hollywood has attempted to remake this film several times, and did so failingly.  While the acting often can seem over the top, no one has ever been able to capture the lightning in a bottle that Kazan did with his amazing cast in this truly classic film.",4,Haunting view of a young man in pain,1047945600,"03 18, 2003",2003,2224,"['Elia', 'Kazan', 'East', 'Eden', 'based', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'modern', 'tale', 'Kane', 'Abel.While', 'film', 'certainly', 'fantastic', 'probably', 'greatest', 'claim', 'fame', 'was', 'James', 'Dean', 'first', 'film', 'rare', 'today', 'see', 'novice', 'young', 'actor', 'remember', 'Dean', 'was', 'only', '22', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'secure', 'leading', 'role', 'high', 'profile', 'drama', 'was', 'then', 'nail', 'so', 'well', 'critics', 'everywhere', 'fell', 'spell', 'Prior', 'film', 'Dean', 'had', 'only', 'made', 'handful', 'commericials', 'television', 'appearances', 'one', 'two', 'worthwhile', 'theatrical', 'roles.In', 'era', 'when', 'screenplay', 'meant', 'acting', 'screen', 'playing', 'last', 'row', 'Dean', 'Clift', 'personally', 'regrettably', 'Brando', 'were', 'only', 'actors', 'there', 'playing', 'reality.Dean', 'Cal', 'tortured', 'youth', 'who', 'never', 'won', 'strict', 'father', 'formidable', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'acceptance', 'desperately', 'do', 'so', 'brother', 'Aaron', 'played', 'Dick', 'Davalos', 'obviously', 'favored', 'father', 'further', 'wounds', 'Cal', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'Aaron', 'fiance', 'fawning', 'often', 'obsequious', 'girl', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'off', 'putting', 'times.Joan', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'Cal', 'Aaron', 'dead', 'mother', 'Rather', 'suffer', 'embarrassment', 'admitting', 'failures', 'husband', 'father', 'man', 'boys', 'father', 'everyone', 'else', 'mother', 'long', 'ago', 'died', 'truth', 'been', 'running', 'bordello', 'next', 'town.Through', 'series', 'machinations', 'Cal', 'mother', 'assistance', 'winning', 'father', 'plot', 'miserably', 'Cal', 'setting', 'off', 'chain', 'events', 'one', 'can', 'return.Dean', 'performance', 'only', 'one', 'be', 'seen', 'was', 'alive', 'registered', 'off', 'Richter', 'scale', 'youth', '1950', 'had', 'seen', 'someone', 'age', 'portray', 'someone', 'age', 'such', 'believable', 'manner', 'became', 'instant', 'star.As', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'attempted', 'remake', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'did', 'so', 'failingly', 'acting', 'often', 'can', 'seem', 'top', 'one', 'ever', 'been', 'able', 'capture', 'lightning', 'bottle', 'Kazan', 'did', 'amazing', 'cast', 'truly', 'classic', 'film']",N/A

231409,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6300267865,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[4, 7]","This film is a classic because of James Dean who is probably at his best here; It is a classic too because it usurps the title of a classic novel by John Steinbeck. It is unimaginable why Steinbeck accepted that film since it is a pure perversion of his novel. Steinbeck should have rejected his paternity and asked for important damages. Maybe that was to long before Stephen King's and the Lawnmower Man. Elia Kazan is here the main culprit and should be brought to court.The place is all wrong. It is exclusively Salinas and the bottom of the valley and not at all the ranch up the valley where nearly two thirds of the novel take place. Of course those two thirds are completely eradicated from the film. The brothels, or houses of ill fame are situated in a costal city, Monterey, beyond a ridge of mountains which prevents the boys from plainly walking to Kate's. Caleb has to take a train to go there, which makes the last twist in the story, Caleb walking his brother Aron to the brothel to meet his mother is impossible because it is unimaginable that Aron, in the state of rejection of his brother he is at that moment, would in any way have accepted to take a freight train to Monterey.That's not the only un-understandable change on places and locales. The book concentrates on only one very short period of time in the novel and is obliged to move everything around. The car for instance is delivered in the book in the ranch up the valley when the boys are very young teens and not in Salinas. That of course changes everything. But the greatest changes are with the characters.The characters have no past which means they have no density. They are caricatures and sketches but they are not human. For example Kate, or Cathy if you prefer: her criminal past is not mentioned, the firing of a gun at Adam is then purely circumstantial and not the continuation of a criminal nature. Her killing the Madame of the whore house some time after the moment when she arrives there and after that madame has signed the will that gives the whore house to Kate, is of course erased and you cannot understand how without one single cent or even dime under her name, when she runs away from her husband and her sons, she can become the sole owner of the whore house, and what's more accepted by the sheriff. In the same way her planning to blackmail all the important people of the community who have visited her house at some time or other is of course taken away. The film even gives her some positive side since she lends the five thousand dollars Caleb needs to start his bean business with Will Hamilton and we don't even know what's the connection between the Trasks and the Hamiltons since it goes back to the first two thirds of the novel.Her final suicide and her final will giving everything to her son Aron, and only that one, at the moment when he is dying in France is of course taken away.The second intolerable change is the erasing of Lee, the Chinese servant of the family who was there before the birth of the boys and who raised them in the total absence and inconsistency of the father. Lee does not exist in the film. Then who takes care of the house? Who cooks? Who prepares coffee? And who lends the five thousand dollars? Lee is the acme of good in this pile of manure and he is the only one who, with Chinese wisdom, can turn a shovelful of manure into a plateful of gold. He is the one who makes Adam forgive Caleb for his horrible act that sent Aron to his death. The end turns mushy and spineless and nerveless and innocuous, unimportant, banal.The third change is Adam. Adam is a careless totally non-invested person who was made that by the running away and shooting of Cathy/Kate. He is the one who never quotes the Bible in the book. The only reading in the Bible he does is the turning point and central nervous system of the whole novel, and this reading that took place on the ranch up in the valley, and not at Adam's initiative, is of course taken out: the 16 first verses of the fourth chapter of Genesis (Abel and Cain) with the particularly central verse 7 and the long research  and discussion of the meaning of that verse in the book. It is the conviction of Lee taken from Chinese wisdom that man is free to choose good or evil that brings Lee to go back to the Hebrew version of that verse 7 with four other learned Chinese in San Francisco and two rabbis and find out that all available translations quoted in the book are lies because they replace the freedom of choice of man given by God himself with a prediction from God or an order from God. Adam is not a Bible quoting bigot. Adam is not rejecting Caleb because he is doing bad things, but because he Adam has selected Aron as the only true one because he looks like the picture of Cathy he has kept in his mind. He loves Aron as if he were his runaway wife and he rejects Caleb because he does not look like her, in fact he looks like Charles, Adam's brother, another erasure in the film.The lettuce episode is reduced to nothing. The two boys are in high school and at the end Aron passes a year to get to college faster and become an Episcopalian minister faster and the drastic episode of the meeting of Aron and his mother is on the Friday of Thanksgiving 1917. That's when Abra, Aron's girl fiend, loses Aron because he dreams her as if she were a Holy Virgin, a new Mary, as if she were able to give birth to a new Jesus without him doing any kind of sexual dirty games. The rivalry between the two boys is not the result of some kind of rivalry concerning the girl. The final choice is the girl's after the departure, disappearance and death of Aron on the day following Thanksgiving 1817. And Lee plays a central role in that twist in the fabric of the novel.Then this 1955 production shows the direct effects of McCarthy and his campaign in Hollywood and at the same time the moralistic choking trap that was falling onto films at the time. Censorship, self-censorship which is just as bad and a lot more effective, took away from all plots elements that could in any way sound morally or sexually fishy and it added a lot of fake patriotic ardour and celebration which is in no way present in the novel.This film with a tremendous young actor who could have done a career if he had not been frustrated to the point of dying in a speeding car is unluckily a complete betrayal of the novel and the phenomenal message Steinbeck was levelling at our blind and vengeful society.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",3,This film is the acme of betrayal of the

Dean stars as the troubled son of Raymond Massey, always trying to please his father, but without much success.  Richard Davalos is Dean's brother, and he has his father's love and the love of a sensitive young girl played by Julie Harris.  The boys are named Cal and Aaron, which reminds us of Cain and Abel, and so does their relationship.  Dean gives one of those raw, emotional performances that is sometimes almost uncomfortable to watch it is so real.  The rest of the cast is also excellent, with Jo Van Fleet giving an edgy portrayal of the boys &quot;lost&quot; mother.  The struggle for approval and the feeling of not fitting in is one that we can all appreciate, and it is sensitively and dramatically presented.

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[6, 8]","Director Elia Kazan dramatized only a segment of John Steinbeck's brilliant and disturbing novel, ""East of Eden,"" in this 1955 production. Major portions of the multi-generational saga have been omitted here, but the film, which parallels the biblical rivalry between brothers Cain and Able, is quite powerful when judged on its own merits, and not in comparison with its literary counterpart. Paul Osborn wrote the intelligently adapted, but compressed screenplay.The movie is set in Salinas, California, during WWI. Adam Trask, (Raymond Massey), a lettuce farmer, is a devoutly religious, moralizing and forbidding man. His twin sons, Caleb, called ""Cal,"" (James Dean), a brooding, tormented loner, and Aaron, (Richard Davalos), the more conventional, dutiful son, constantly vie for their father's love and attention. Cal has a dark, edgy side to his personality and believes he is a ""bad seed."" The boys have been told that their mother died when they were born. However Cal discovers otherwise. There are shadowy secrets in the family's past which were never meant to be brought to light. Kathy Trask, (Jo Van Fleet), abandoned her boys at birth and now runs a local brothel. When Cal finds out, he is more convinced than ever that he is wicked like his mom, just as Aaron is good like their father.Adam obviously favors his son Aaron, and discredits Cal, who is extremely jealous and competitive. Everything Cal gives to his father is rejected, with devastating consequences, while Aaron's gifts are accepted and appreciated. The friction between the two is exacerbated by their rivalry for the affection of Aaron's girlfriend, Abra, (Julie Harris), whom Cal adores.James Dean, in his starring debut, gives a riveting performance as Caleb Trask. His desperate longing for his father's love is palpable, as is his terrible anguish. The scenes which feature Dean and Jo Van Fleet are electrifying in intensity.Kazan's ""East of Eden"" celebrates its 50th birthday this year. It deserves its title as a great American classic.

Since the majority of viewers meet these criteria it is easy to see why the film finds a new audience with each generation. And it is easy to understand the tears that are often shed by both first-time and repeat viewers.Although set at the start of World War I, the generational issues portrayed really had came to a head by the mid-1950's. Which is why the film was so timely and contemporary when it was released. It was Elia Kazan's troubled relationship with his own father that first attracted him to Steinbeck's novel and caused him to focus the film on the portion of the story that addressed this issue.Originally I ranked it a distant third in the James Dean film pecking order but over the years it has somehow passed ""Giant"" and ""Rebel Without a Cause"" IMHO, and I now find it to be clearly his best and more enduring work. It is a real actors/director's film, with just six significant characters and with especially good performances from Dean and from Julie Harris. Both were a bit old for their parts but Dean's boyish manner allowed him to sell the character and Harris (who had convincingly played a twelve year old just a few years earlier in ""Member of the Wedding"") looks the proper age in every scene except one (an outdoor scene shot in the bright sun). She struggles sometimes with reining in her sophistication but that could just be the subjective perception of this viewer.Here are some random points to appreciate in this great film:Don't misinterpret Cal's (Dean) motivation, he is not doing things to win his father's love but because he loves his father (communicated by the early scene where he watches his father working in the kitchen). The former motivation would be simplistic; the latter opens up a host of interesting and ironic interpretations as you realize the seemingly bad son Cal actually understands his father and admires his goodness more than ""good"" son Aron (Richard Davalos).Aron is not really the innocent figure he appears to be, he does not like Cal and throughout the film betrays him.Abra (Harris) is caught between the two brothers, moving steadily from Aron to Cal as the film progresses. Aron represents everything she understands that she should be and Cal represents everything she has been denying herself. The story is largely seen from her point of view, and her growth parallels her (and the audiences) slow realization that Cal is not bad but misunderstood. The two are slowly falling in love but do not kiss until she gets up in the ferris wheel, a place where (symbolically) she is no longer standing on solid practical ground.It is really a coming of age story for both of them, with Abra slowly embracing new areas of human experience and Cal moving from adolescence to manhood; thanks largely to her timely interventions. Watch for subtle details that Kazan has included, like Cal's inability to make extended eye contact with his father, brother, and mother; something that he has no problem doing with Abra. And Cal's unsteady progress as he moves forward momentarily and then retreats by looking away.Note Kazan's use of a raked camera angle for the scenes inside the Trask home, unfortunately this device is a little too extreme and calls attention to itself. Also used in ""The Third Man"", it was done to reinforce the off-kilter nature of this family's dynamic. It goes away after the scene in which Cal finally confronts his lifelong jealousy of his brother and accuses his father of rejecting him because he is much like his mother, telling Adam (Raymond Massey) that he cannot forgive himself for marrying Kate. This is point at which Cal moves forward into permanent manhood, prior to this he had stepped forward and then retreating back into childhood.Watch for the method-acting device of an actor playing with an object as a means to introduce naturalism into the scene (Abra first flirts with Cal with a flower, Jo Van Fleet makes a show of taking out and lighting a cigarette, Cal repeatedly dips his finger into a wine glass). ""East of Eden"" would be nothing but an overwrought melodrama without a host of little things like this that humanize the story.Watch for the awkward tension between Cal and Adam, Kazan cultivated the off-screen friction between Dean and Massey; reasoning that it would translate into more realistic on-screen sequences between the two actors.Watch for the stunning sequence late in the film when Cal slowly moves out from under the tree branches (his menace reinforced nicely by the score).Finally note the contrast between the restrained closing scene (which is also the climax) and the melodramatic style of the almost everything that has preceded it in the film.Then again, what do I know?

231436,A39IY0JU5JI69G,6300267865,"Promise ""promise""","[0, 0]","James Dean has become a legend, both because of his amazing talent and the fact that he died so young.  One has to wonder how he would have developed if he had lived longer. He, Montgomery Clift and Marlon Brando all appeared at the same time, with the same soul searing magic. Clift died young too.  Would Dean have self destructed like Marlon Brando or matured to handsome but sensible old-age like Paul Newman and Robert Redford?  Of course we don't know, but fortunately we have these records of the few films he made, to enjoy.Elia Kazan made this movie from a book by Steinbeck, who was inspired by the write of the book of Genesis.  Pretty good stuff!  Add the wonderful actors, (besides Dean,) Julie Harris, Raymond Massey and Jo Van Fleet...and how can you miss?The story is deep and universal with fundamental human problems.  Who can't relate to wanting to be loved? to be considered good? to having one's gifts honored?  We see the ""good"" man, Adam, who has ideals and standards, who wants to make a contribution for the next generation, who sincerely tries to do what he believes is right, but who has no idea that his very ""goodness"" is crushing the life of his son, Cal, just as he crushed the life of his former wife. We see the former wife, by all standards a ""bad"" woman, a madame, who is profiteering off of the weaknesses of others and yet we come to like her.  As the Julie Harris character says, she really doesn't know what's good and what's bad anymore.There's an interesting sub-plot in which a formerly considered ""good"" neighbor, a German shoemaker, is now considered to be ""bad"" because we're now at war with Germany.At the time this film appeared, our country was just about ready to wake up from the myth of ""we're good and everyone else is bad."" We had fought and defeated the bad guys in another world war and had grown fat and complacent in our new prosperity.  We were on the brink of the 60's in which all hell broke loose and a whole new generation of young people would rise up and re-write the rules of morality.  Dean, in this film, portends the new revolution in consciousness, which is why, in my opinion, he captured the hearts and souls of so many people.  He embodied the spirit that was ready to burst out...that of the guy who dared to break the rules, to discover for himself what was right..(.but boy, it sure wasn't easy.)  Dean's talent, good looks and charm dressed this new rebellious spirit in a very attractive package; we wouldn't have fallen so hard for a mere thug.

231437,A1QR6M5IKJ2HGN,6300267865,"R. Dalusung ""Consular""","[0, 0]","This film is absolutely amazing. All the performances were so incredibly well done. Elia Kazan directed this with a great sense of trust in his actors (especially Dean), allowing them to delve deeply into character. If you don't know anything about James Dean, this is the film that got him famous. Yes, &#34;Rebel Without A Cause&#34; is the most popular, though &#34;East of Eden&#34; was his breakthrough performance. Another fun fact for newbies: Dean purposely went out of his way to irritate and annoy Raymond Massey off and on set, performing scenes differently or not following the script fully, sparking a hatred between the two; it shows to an electrifying degree in the film. If I had to rate Dean's three major pictures: &#34;East of Eden&#34; would probably be the best in terms of directing and acting. &#34;Rebel Without a Cause&#34; would likely be his most popular and iconic, and &#34;Giant&#34; would be his greatest performance out of the three films.VIDEO QUALITY: Quite superb. Colors are vivid, there's a nice clean picture all around, and the overall remastering seems like it's been released with great care. If you're into the highest quality versions of films, get this blu-ray instead of the older DVD.AUDIO QUALITY: It's mostly front heavy, but the score bleeds into the surround speakers subtly enough to bring you in towards the picture, providing an engaging immersion into the film. The new DTS-HD MA lossless sound provides a very clear set up compared to the DVD: dynamic range is wider, dialogue was always clear, and everything sounded revitalized well enough (no tinny sounds).SPECIAL FEATURES: I think all the DVD features were brought over to this new blu-ray release, plus (correct me if I'm wrong) there were some new screen tests of the actors (black & white w/ sound and some w/o), which were very intriguing to watch. Dean's emotionally driven acting style (this was, of course, made during the height of the Method acting years) is truly refreshing to behold, even during screen tests of films made several decades ago. Many actors today still hold Dean as inspiration.So, if you're looking for the best possible version of this film, I'd recommend getting this blu-ray edition. Also, the box art/cover art is designed so beautifully for all three films. It's kind of pretty to just look at amongst your collection.",5,blu-ray review: quite possibly Dean's best,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,2361,"['film', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'performances', 'were', 'so', 'incredibly', 'well', 'done', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'directed', 'great', 'sense', 'trust', 'actors', 'especially', 'Dean', 'allowing', 'delve', 'deeply', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'James', 'Dean', 'film', 'got', 'famous', 'Yes', '34', 'Rebel', 'A', 'Cause', '34', 'most', 'popular', '34', 'East', 'Eden', '34', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'performance', 'fun', 'fact', 'newbies', 'Dean', 'purposely', 'went', 'way', 'irritate', 'annoy', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'off', 'set', 'performing', 'scenes', 'differently', 'not', 'following', 'script', 'fully', 'sparking', 'hatred', 'two', 'electrifying', 'degree', 'film', 'had', 'rate', 'Dean', 'three', 'major', 'pictures', '34', 'East', 'Eden', '34', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'best', 'terms', 'directing', 'acting', '34', 'Rebel', 'Cause', '34', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'most', 'popular', 'iconic', '34', 'Giant', '34', 'would', 'be', 'greatest', 'performance', 'three', 'films.VIDEO', 'QUALITY', 'Quite', 'superb', 'Colors', 'are', 'vivid', 'nice', 'clean', 'picture', 'overall', 'remastering', 'been', 'released', 'great', 'care', ""'re"", 'highest', 'quality', 'versions', 'films', 'get', 'blu-ray', 'instead', 'older', 'DVD.AUDIO', 'QUALITY', 'mostly', 'front', 'heavy', 'score', 'surround', 'subtly', 'enough', 'bring', 'towards', 'picture', 'providing', 'engaging', 'immersion', 'film', 'new', 'DTS-HD', 'MA', 'lossless', 'sound', 'very', 'clear', 'set', 'up', 'compared', 'DVD', 'dynamic', 'range', 'wider', 'dialogue', 'was', 'always', 'clear', 'everything', 'sounded', 'revitalized', 'well', 'enough', 'tinny', '.SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'think', 'DVD', 'features', 'were', 'brought', 'over', 'new', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'correct', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'were', 'new', 'screen', 'tests', 'actors', 'black', 'white', 'w/', 'sound', 'w/o', 'were', 'very', 'intriguing', 'watch', 'Dean', 'emotionally', 'driven', 'acting', 'style', 'was', 'course', 'made', 'height', 'Method', 'acting', 'years', 'truly', 'refreshing', 'behold', 'even', 'screen', 'tests', 'films', 'made', 'several', 'decades', 'ago', 'Many', 'actors', 'today', 'still', 'hold', 'Dean', 'inspiration.So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'best', 'possible', 'version', 'film', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'getting', 'blu-ray', 'edition', 'Also', 'box', 'art', 'designed', 'so', 'beautifully', 'three', 'films', 'kind', 'pretty', 'just', 'look', 'amongst', 'collection']",N/A

231439,A12X2J7AVZ04IQ,6300267865,"R. Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[4, 5]","Elia Kazan has presented many of America's finest films, from ""Streetcar"", ""On the Waterfront"", and the incredible ""East of Eden"", finally available on DVD in a wonderful 2-disc version in a wide letterbox. In this case, the 2nd disc actually has stuff that is interesting, regarding casting, background info and wonderful commentaries from some remaining cast members (mostly Julie Harris) and Kazan himself. The amazing debut of James Dean, of course, is the #1 reason to have this in your collection. His performance is often improvised, much to Kazan's surprise and delight. He brought out elements in the character that even Kazan hadn't considered. Indeed, Dean is certainly of the Brando school, but there is no mimicry. This is a true original. It's anybody's guess where his career would have gone had he lived. Tabloids painted Dean as some kind of maniac, so I was interested to learn that his fatal accident wasn't his fault. I don't want to give away too much about the extras, because they give so much insight regarding Mr. Dean that I'd rather you enjoy them yourself. I will say that you should watch Raymond Massey in every scene, because Dean improvised almost every scene, and Massey, the seasoned pro, wasn't sure where to go with any scene, a great display by both. As you already know, this film is based on the last third of Steinbeck's novel. At this point, the character of Kate (one of the most manipulative, mean characters in literature) is sitting alone, old and rich, running a successful brothel. Jo Van Fleet, in her first film role, plays Kate with fierce conviction, with generous hints of her meanness. She most deservedly won the Oscar. Her abandoned husband, Adam (Massey) and 2 sons Cal (Dean) and Aaron (Richard Davalos) are only 30 miles away. Cal learns that his birth mother may be around, maverick that he is, and he searches her out. The relationship that develops when Cal finally meets Kate is the catalyst of the first part of the film. His ongoing alienation with his father pretty much covers the second half, some great improvisation and a bewildered Massey. Priceless. Previous reviewers thought Julie Harris was too old to play Abra, but it worked for me (4 years earlier she was nominated for Best Actress for playing a 12 year old in ""Member of the Wedding""). I'm sure it's subjective; I've always loved Julie Harris. Massey was wonderful as the father who loved the one son and had no use for the other, which made Cal work harder for that affection. The father/son alienation is very well established. Richard Davalos was great as Aaron, and I'm not sure what happened to his career. Then there's Lois Smith...Kate's barmaid/servant; so wonderful as Nicholson's sister in ""5 Easy Pieces"", and later loads of fun as Aunt Meg in ""Twister"". Too much to say about this very complicated, compelling film adaptation, except that Kazan made this after his testimony to the House of Unamerican Activities, where he tattled on his colleagues. His integrity was challenged in Hollywood after that, but he stil received a nomination for this film. He would receive another in 1963 for his very personal ""America America""; later settled for an honorary Oscar a few years ago for lifetime achievement. His body of work is most certainly respectable and deserving of recognition, but many remembered and it was an embarrassing Academy moment. This creates a great argument about when art should be separated from politics. One interesting thing about James Dean, which was a ""Jeopardy!"" question a few years ago...he is the only person to be Oscar nominated twice, posthumously (it took a year after he finished ""Giant"" before it was released).Regarding ""Rebel Without a Cause""? It was an updated version of Dean's performance in ""East of Eden"", but the alienation was differently presented by Nicholas Ray, and Dean had 2 loving but bewildered parents. Any film aficianado or James Dean fan should have this DVD of ""East of Eden"".

231440,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,6300267865,Robert Badgley,"[1, 1]","East of Eden(released March/55)was a film by director Elia Kazan based on John Steinbecks /52 novel of the same name.Warners issued the film on this two disc edition in a mastered print from the original film elements with a plethora of extras.The only way to go.The story finds us in the west coast California communities of Salinas and Monterey in the U.S. pre-war period of 1917.Adam Trask(Raymond Massey)is a gentleman farmer who has two sons,Aron(Richard Davalos) and Cal(James Dean).Adam has showered most of his affections on Aron,which has left Cal very frustrated and bitter towards his dad;longing desperately for the love he has never had.As a result Cal has become shy,defensive and acts out without warning.His father has raised the two boys alone,as he and his wife split many years before,her whereabouts unknown.Adam grows lettuce and has come up with an idea for refrigerating the product during its long trek by train,so as to keep it fresher until it reaches the markets.He has thrown his entire life savings into the project.In the meantime Cal,who comes and goes at will,has been taking repeated long train rides to Monterey,15 miles away.While there he has been following a certain woman who runs the areas biggest brothel.After one attempt in particular gets  him tossed out bodily,he returns and is finally able to walk along the road with her side by side.All he has wanted is to talk with her and when he finally gets his chance he finds out what he has been looking for.The woman is the boys long lost mother.Back on the farm Adam is preparing his first major crop for shipment.Because of his new found satisfaction regarding his mothers discovery,Cal,who has been AWOL throughout most of the farming,now throws all his ingenuity into things and comes up with ideas to speed things up.This earns the approval of his father which he has longed for.The day arrives and the crop is packed with ice and shipped out on the train.However a snow landslide in the mountains about 100 miles out causes the train to eventually return to Salinas,its' precious cargo spoiling as the ice melts.Adam is financially broke.Cal is bound and determined to get his fathers money back for him and wants to raise a major bean crop,but he has no money for such a project.Bean prices are set to soar as the U.S. is on the verge of entering(and eventually will)W.W.1,so there is no better time to start.Cal returns to Monterrey and asks his mother for $5,000.With that money he enters into a partnership with the same man who helped his father with the lettuce crop.Together they plant,harvest and Cal is able to raise his fathers money back;all without his fathers knowledge.Meanwhile Aron's girlfriend Abra(Julie Harris),who was devoted to him at the start,has now by happenstance been spending more time with Cal.It turns out both she and Cal have more in common with each than was originally thought.Aron's domineering personality(like his father),has worn on Abra to the extent that she is no longer in love with him but has fallen for Cal.Cal and Abra on Adams birthday,decorate the house and surprise him.Cal wants the occasion just right and he presents his father with the grand surprise;the money his father lost with the lettuce scheme.Cal explains how he raised the money but his father,who works on the local draft board,feels it is making profit off the young men who are now going to war.He tells Cal to return the money from whence it came.This breaks Cal's heart who runs outside.Aron follows and berates Cal for his long standing behaviour.In a fit of revenge he takes Aron to Monterey and introduces a shocked Aron to his mother,who,as usual at night,is in her cups.Cal returns to Salinas,as does a very drunk Aron who joins up to serve overseas.His father runs to the train station to try and talk him out of it.Aron,on seeing his father,laughingly puts his head through the glass window,as the train pulls out.His father has a debilitating stroke right on the spot and is bedridden.With Aron gone there is no one left to look after his father but Cal.A nurse is called in by the doctor to care for Adam but she is cold and selfish.Abra has a heart to heart with Adam beseeching him to ask for Cals help,as it will show him Adam needs/loves him.Abra then asks Cal to reconcile with his father,whose prognosis,long term,is not good.Reluctantly Cal goes to his father,apologizing for his behaviour and asking him if there is anything he can do for him.His father,using all the strength he can muster,tells Cal to get rid of the nurse who he can't stand.Cal can't abide the nurse either,and the film ends as Cal pulls up a chair near his fathers bed,content that his father finally needs him and cares for him.This film sports a host of powerful performances.Jo Van fleet who played Cal's mother got the best supporting nod from the Academy for her performance.Raymond Massey is spot on as the stiff,feelings-close-to-the-chest father,Julie Harris is great as Arons girl,and eventually Cals, and of course Dean pulls in a solid performance as the second fiddle playing brother Cal,full of resentment and angst.Kudos also go to Burl Ives as the town sheriff in his small but good supporting role.If there is a weak spot in it,it is Davalos as Aron,who can't quite keep up with Dean in the acting department,in his role as the number one son.Technically,the film print has been struck using the original film and sound elements,som it looks and sounds great.Extras include:commentary by film historian Richard Schickel,a 50th anniversary documentary on Dean,the documentary Forever James Dean,Screen Tests,deleted scenes,wardrobe,costume and production design film tests,the trailer and footage from the March/55 premiere of the film.The premiere is hosted by NY DJ Martin Block whose bigband broadcasts of the 40s are now legendary.And watch for a very dour looking John Steinbeck,trying to act the ""I'm a great author and you aren't""thing.The film is in its original a/r in cinemascope.All in all this is a highly recommended film for not only Dean fans but for all students of the cinema.The drama may appear to some as kind of melodramatic in this day and age,but make no mistake,these are solid performance almost to a man here.Dean's acting style stands out as so different that he steals every scene he's in.A must have,and it's done up right!",5,East of Eden done up right!,1322524800,"11 29, 2011",2011,6368,"['East', 'Eden',

231441,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6300267865,Robert Morris,"[54, 63]","Note: The review that follows was written more than two years ago. Fortunately, this superb film is now available in a DVD format. Thank you to those resposible for an overdue but nonethrless most appreciated provision. That said, as for the review itsdelf, I still have the same opinions it expresses.It has been (hard to believe) 52 years since this film first appeared, in the same year during which Rebel Without a Cause was also released. Both feature James Dean. I have often wondered to what extent his unique and abundant talents as an actor would have developed, had he not perished in a car accident immediately after the filming of Giant had been completed. Of course, we will never know. His was a compelling presence in each of only three films and especially so in East of Eden in the role of Cal Trask.The basic story is derived from the Biblical account of Cain and Abel. Adam Trask (Raymond Massey) has two sons, both of whom he presumably loves. However, he favors Aron (Dick Davalos) because he (unlike Cal) never says or does anything to irritate him. Aron is ""the good son,"" complete with a girlfriend Abra (Julie Harris) whom his father obviously adores. Of course, Cal feels resentment toward both his father and brother. He desperately wants his father's love. (Later in the film, he even tries to buy it with profits he earns from investments enriched by World War One.) Under Elia Kazan's brilliant direction, tensions build relentlessly to what seems certain to be a tragic conclusion. Feeling rejected by his father, Cal seeks out his mother who left her husband and sons years ago. Kate Trask (Jo Van Fleet) now owns and manages a brothel in another town nearby and has become wealthy. Cal climbs aboard a freight train so that he can visit her frequently. Over time, they develop mutual respect and affection. Finally the climatic moment occurs and then....The acting throughout the cast (with one exception) is outstanding. Van Fleet received an Academy Award for best actress in a supporting role and Dean was also nominated for the award as best actor in a leading role. Burl Ives and Albert Dekker are noteworthy in their supporting roles. However, Julie Harris (age 30 at that time) seems to me miscast as the teenage Abra. As for Massey, he does the best he can with the role of Adam Trask, recycling elements of his earlier portrayal of John Brown in Sante Fe Trail. Most of Steinbeck's fiction is set in the Monterey area, as is East of Eden. Kazan and his cinematographer, Ted D. McCord, took full advantage of that uncommonly lovely area when shooting various exteriors.I welcome the DVD version of East of Eden.",5,Thank you,1075766400,"02 3, 2004",2004,2652,"['Note', 'review', 'was', 'written', 'more', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'Fortunately', 'superb', 'film', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'format', 'Thank', 'resposible', 'overdue', 'nonethrless', 'most', 'appreciated', 'provision', 'said', 'review', 'itsdelf', 'still', 'have', 'same', 'opinions', 'been', 'hard', 'believe', '52', 'years', 'film', 'first', 'appeared', 'same', 'year', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'was', 'also', 'released', 'feature', 'James', 'Dean', 'have', 'often', 'wondered', 'what', 'extent', 'unique', 'abundant', 'talents', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'developed', 'had', 'not', 'perished', 'car', 'accident', 'immediately', 'filming', 'Giant', 'had', 'been', 'completed', 'course', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'was', 'compelling', 'presence', 'only', 'three', 'films', 'especially', 'so', 'East', 'Eden', 'role', 'Cal', 'Trask.The', 'basic', 'story', 'derived', 'Biblical', 'account', 'Cain', 'Abel', 'Adam', 'Trask', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'two', 'sons', 'whom', 'presumably', 'However', 'Aron', 'Dick', 'Davalos', 'Cal', 'never', 'anything', 'irritate', 'Aron', 'good', 'son', 'complete', 'girlfriend', 'Abra', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'whom', 'father', 'obviously', 'course', 'Cal', 'feels', 'resentment', 'father', 'brother', 'desperately', 'father', 'love', 'Later', 'film', 'even', 'buy', 'profits', 'investments', 'enriched', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'tensions', 'build', 'relentlessly', 'what', 'certain', 'be', 'tragic', 'conclusion', 'Feeling', 'rejected', 'father', 'Cal', 'out', 'mother', 'who', 'left', 'husband', 'sons', 'years', 'ago', 'Kate', 'Trask', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'now', 'brothel', 'town', 'nearby', 'become', 'wealthy', 'Cal', 'freight', 'train', 'so', 'can', 'visit', 'frequently', 'time', 'develop', 'mutual', 'respect', 'affection', 'Finally', 'climatic', 'moment', 'occurs', 'then', '.The', 'acting', 'cast', 'one', 'exception', 'outstanding', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'actress', 'supporting', 'role', 'Dean', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'award', 'best', 'actor', 'leading', 'role', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'Albert', 'Dekker', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'supporting', 'roles', 'However', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'age', '30', 'time', 'miscast', 'teenage', 'Abra', 'Massey', 'best', 'can', 'role', 'Adam', 'Trask', 'recycling', 'elements', 'earlier', 'portrayal', 'John', 'Brown', 'Sante', 'Fe', 'Trail', 'Most', 'Steinbeck', 'fiction', 'set', 'Monterey', 'area', 'East', 'Eden', 'Kazan', 'cinematographer', 'Ted', 'D.', 'McCord', 'took', 'full', 'advantage', 'uncommonly', 'lovely', 'area', 'when', 'shooting', 'various', 'exteriors.I', 'welcome', 'DVD', 'version', 'East', 'Eden']",N/A

I liked the high standard biblical preaching father, the confused unloved competing youth in James Dean, the very confident rival brother, and his personality plus girlfriend, but to me Jo Van Fleet stole the show. I can't help it!Her exquisite dominance character portrayal, of the far distant and serious mother, gave me reason to relish. I happen to like strong women in movies, I don't know why. She begins as a total mystery, a dark woman walking alone by herself, making huge sums of money deposits in the town bank. She gets followed by a stranger who turns out to be her lost son of days gone by. They reunite, by his intrusion, and they get to know each other and she finds he has a dilemma. That get to know each other scene in her small ""office"" makes me a big believer in top notch acting that can leave one breathless, without technical effects. It is a well filmed scene that leaves two pros to do what they do best-act!Her trail of actions like lighting the cigarette, reaching for the ink pen, slightly fisting herself on the forehead, and dozing off alone late at night in her office chair, make her one of the most noteable cinematic female characters since Judith Anderson's Mrs. Danvers from Alfred Hitchcock's REBECCA. Timeless piece of work that will live on forever in movie history.By the way, I read one comment that Jo Van Fleet's appearance was actually minimal, but then Margaret Hamilton supposedly had only 12 full minutes of on screen time as the Wicked Witch Of The West.

James Dean's performance is fascinating, given the fact that he was only 22 at the time, in his first major role, which he nailed. Otherwise, this one falls short in almost all respects. The plot here is insipid, and so is all of the other acting except for Dean. Yes, the plot is there--two sons vying for the father's affection. Problem is, the father is a self-righteous, not-very-bright boob, who I found impossible to like. Julie Harris, as Cal's (Dean's) brother's fiance, is appealing, but we never really get to know her, and her character is underdeveloped in this disappointing film. Nor does this film really capture the magic of the Monterey-Salinas area, which is is a wonderful, atmospheric part of the country.

231445,AY3AVLL5IWW9,6300267865,Russell Fanelli,"[0, 0]","East of Eden is a great, sprawling American novel by nobel prize winning author John Steinbeck.  The film East of Eden, directed by Elia Kazan, dramatizes only a small part of the magnificent book.  However, what the film does, it does exceptionally well, thanks to the riveting performances of James Dean and academy award winner Jo Van Fleet.Much has been written about Dean as an actor and what is certainly true is that when he is on screen, you can't take your eyes off him.  As young Cal Trask, Dean vies for the attention and love of his father, Adam, Raymond Massesy, with his twin brother Aaron, Richard Davalos.  Cal is a loser, no matter what he does, and Dean portrays sensitively the conflict Cal feels as he grows to manhood unloved and uncared for.The rivalry between Cal and Aaron for their father's love as well as the affections of Abra, Aaron's girlfriend played by Julie Harris, generates much of the action and dramatic tension of the film. All Cal's gifts are rejected by his father, in contrast to Aaron, whose presents are appreciated and valued.Like Cain in the Bible, Cal has a dark side which he thinks comes from his mother Kate, who abandoned him at birth and whom he has discovered runs a brothel in Salinas, California, a short train ride from the Trask ranch.  Cal introduces himself to Kate, played to perfection by Jo Van Fleet, first to try to learn about himself, who he is and why he experiences his inner rage and frustration.  Later he will borrow money from her to invest in order to help his bankrupt father.  Cal's investment in bean futures, just prior to America's entry in World War I,  pays off, but his father rejects his money in a confrontation which moves us toward the dramatic conclusion of the film.The scenes with Dean and Van Fleet are the highlight of the film and a treasure of American movie making.  Both actors are electric with Dean drawing from his inner uncertainty and fire and Van Fleet, the consumate professional, using all her skills and intelligence.  They approach one another gingerly, each testing the response of the other, not trusting themselves and their own emotions, and finally becoming frustrated with their inablility to connect with one another.  These scenes are wonderful to watch.  We should not expect a happy ending and we don't get it.East of Eden, released in 1955, justly takes its place in a small list of fine American films, not just because of the great performances of James Dean and Jo Van Fleet, but also because it dramatizes timeless themes in a most convincing fashion.  Those viewers who love the film and like to read will almost certainly enjoy the novel on which the film is based.",5,Wonderful acting by James Dean and Jo Van Fleet.,1076112000,"02 7, 2004",2004,2685,"['East', 'Eden', 'great', 'sprawling', 'American', 'novel', 'nobel', 'prize', 'winning', 'author', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'film', 'East', 'Eden', 'directed', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'magnificent', 'book', 'However', 'what', 'film', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'thanks', 'riveting', 'performances', 'James', 'Dean', 'academy', 'award', 'winner', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet.Much', 'been', 'written', 'about', 'Dean', 'actor', 'what', 'certainly', 'true', 'when', 'screen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'young', 'Cal', 'Trask', 'Dean', 'vies', 'attention', 'love', 'father', 'Adam', 'Raymond', 'Massesy', 'twin', 'brother', 'Aaron', 'Richard', 'Davalos', 'Cal', 'loser', 'matter', 'what', 'Dean', 'sensitively', 'conflict', 'Cal', 'feels', 'manhood', 'unloved', 'uncared', 'for.The', 'rivalry', 'Cal', 'Aaron', 'father', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'affections', 'Abra', 'Aaron', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'much', 'action', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'film', 'Cal', 'gifts', 'are', 'rejected', 'father', 'contrast', 'Aaron', 'presents', 'are', 'appreciated', 'valued.Like', 'Cain', 'Bible', 'Cal', 'dark', 'side', 'mother', 'Kate', 'who', 'abandoned', 'birth', 'whom', 'discovered', 'brothel', 'Salinas', 'California', 'short', 'train', 'ride', 'Trask', 'ranch', 'Cal', 'Kate', 'played', 'perfection', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'first', 'try', 'learn', 'who', 'why', 'inner', 'rage', 'frustration', 'Later', 'will', 'borrow', 'money', 'invest', 'order', 'help', 'bankrupt', 'father', 'Cal', 'investment', 'bean', 'futures', 'just', 'prior', 'America', 'entry', 'World', 'War', 'father', 'money', 'confrontation', 'dramatic', 'conclusion', 'film.The', 'scenes', 'Dean', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'are', 'highlight', 'film', 'treasure', 'American', 'movie', 'making', 'actors', 'are', 'electric', 'Dean', 'drawing', 'inner', 'uncertainty', 'fire', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'consumate', 'professional', 'using', 'skills', 'intelligence', 'approach', 'one', 'gingerly', 'testing', 'response', 'other', 'not', 'trusting', 'own', 'emotions', 'finally', 'becoming', 'frustrated', 'inablility', 'connect', 'one', 'scenes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'should', 'not', 'expect', 'happy', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.East', 'Eden', 'released', '1955', 'justly', 'place', 'small', 'list', 'fine', 'American', 'films', 'not', 'just', 'great', 'performances', 'James', 'Dean', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'also', 'timeless', 'themes', 'most', 'convincing', 'fashion', 'viewers', 'who', 'love', 'film', 'read', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'novel', 'film', 'based']",N/A

In the book the idea doesn't really crop up till the end. And no viewer could have any feeling for goody-goody brother Aron nor the irritating Abra - Steinbeck gives a depth and understanding to his characters.The boys' mother Kate, who abandoned them to be a brothel mistress, is a hugely darker person than is shown here. I appreciate that 50s censorship meant mention couldn't be made of what went on in her house of ill repute; but neither do we hear anything of her past - she was 'just a drifter' whom Adam Trask fell for. What about her setting the parental home on fire; her poisoning the former madame ?Of course it's a long book and I understand it needed 'pruning'. Perhaps Lee, the faithful Chinese retainer, who features massively in the book, wouldn't translate to well to film.

Adam Trask is a religious man, a believer in all the good of the world as he sees it. He believes his son Aron is a good person; he relies on him for help and advice. His son Cal, however, is a completely different story. He sees Cal as reckless and bad, possibly because Cal reminds him too much of his wife's free spirit. He doesn't want to be reminded of his wife because although he told his sons that their mother is dead, she really left him when the boys were babies. Cal finds this out and learns that maybe he isn't born bad; maybe he makes the decisions that make him who he is.James Dean is amazing as Cal, by far the best part of the film. He is misunderstood, quiet at times but rambunctious at others, blunt, wild, tortured, and absolutely gorgeous. It is hard to take one's eyes off of him. He's such an intriguing character and such an intriguing actor, it is hard to take note of anything else going on. In fact, the character and the actor seem to become one person.

231449,A3BSS2M2DPPV4T,6300267865,"""scotsladdie""","[34, 36]","I first watched this movie on television when I was about 16, because I wondered what all the fuss was about James Dean. I soon found out: he was so unbelievably natural in his acting technique that the audience is captivated by his brilliance. This was Dean's film debut and he burst like a thunderclap in the public's ears, not to mention staid Hollywood, which came to both fear and admire the handsome, rebellious youth. In this haunting John Steinbeck tale, Dean is the neurotic half of twin sons belonging to Bible - reading lettuce farmer Raymond Massey, whose vast acreage stretches through the rich Salinas Valley in California. Aron (Davalos, in another powerful debut) is the well-adjusted upstanding son whose normal relationship with his girlfriend and his diligent pursuit of continuing his father's legacy is admired by the patriarch. Cal is very different from his brother and the troublesome youth mistakenly believes his father doesn't love him. A haunting scene has Dean introduce Davalos to their supposedly dead mother. The boys were brain-washed by their father into believing their mother Kate was some sort of angel: the truthful realisation that she's a financially successful Madam who operates a whorehouse in Monterey causes Davalos to become deeply traumatised. Many people will feel empathy for BOTH brothers during this powerful scene: it shows us that Cal is, if anything, REAL while his brother is somewhat sheltered and idealistic in comparison. The performances are all splendidly colourful and absorbing: Dean is unforgettable as Cal - for whom the audience feels empathy - Julie Harris is fine as Abra (she succumbs to Cal's raw sexuality) and Jo Van Fleet is excellent as the tough yet essentially tender-hearted tubercular Kate who likes her boy Cal because he ""has sense"" as she believes she does. Raymond Massey is fine as the puritanical father, Adam. Burl Ives is memorable as Sam: he quotes the Biblical passage which includes the picture's title. Some critical snobs say that the film was over-directed by Kazan but it made Dean an over-night sensation who acted with a unique naturalistic style and died a legend at the tender age of 24.",5,DEEP & HAUNTING.,1030320000,"08 26, 2002",2002,2183,"['first', 'watched', 'movie', 'television', 'when', 'was', 'about', '16', 'wondered', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'James', 'Dean', 'soon', 'found', 'was', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'natural', 'acting', 'technique', 'audience', 'captivated', 'brilliance', 'was', 'Dean', 'film', 'debut', 'thunderclap', 'public', 'ears', 'not', 'mention', 'staid', 'Hollywood', 'came', 'fear', 'admire', 'handsome', 'rebellious', 'youth', 'haunting', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'tale', 'Dean', 'neurotic', 'half', 'twin', 'sons', 'belonging', 'Bible', 'reading', 'lettuce', 'farmer', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'vast', 'acreage', 'stretches', 'rich', 'Salinas', 'Valley', 'California', 'Aron', 'Davalos', 'powerful', 'debut', 'well-adjusted', 'upstanding', 'son', 'normal', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'diligent', 'pursuit', 'continuing', 'father', 'legacy', 'admired', 'patriarch', 'Cal', 'very', 'different', 'brother', 'troublesome', 'youth', 'mistakenly', 'father', ""n't"", 'love', 'haunting', 'scene', 'Dean', 'introduce', 'Davalos', 'supposedly', 'dead', 'mother', 'boys', 'were', 'brain-washed', 'father', 'believing', 'mother', 'Kate', 'was', 'sort', 'angel', 'truthful', 'realisation', 'financially', 'successful', 'Madam', 'who', 'whorehouse', 'Monterey', 'Davalos', 'become', 'deeply', 'traumatised', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'feel', 'empathy', 'BOTH', 'brothers', 'powerful', 'scene', 'Cal', 'anything', 'REAL', 'brother', 'somewhat', 'sheltered', 'idealistic', 'comparison', 'performances', 'are', 'splendidly', 'colourful', 'absorbing', 'Dean', 'unforgettable', 'Cal', 'whom', 'audience', 'feels', 'empathy', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'fine', 'Abra', 'Cal', 'raw', 'sexuality', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'excellent', 'tough', 'yet', 'essentially', 'tender-hearted', 'tubercular', 'Kate', 'who', 'boy', 'Cal', 'sense', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'fine', 'puritanical', 'father', 'Adam', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'memorable', 'Sam', 'Biblical', 'passage', 'picture', 'title', 'critical', 'snobs', 'say', 'film', 'was', 'over-directed', 'Kazan', 'made', 'Dean', 'over-night', 'sensation', 'who', 'acted', 'unique', 'naturalistic', 'style', 'died', 'legend', 'tender', 'age', '24']",N/A
231450,ACM90BRKX73OG,6300267865,Tom,"[0, 0]","East of Eden (Warner Bros., 1955) was director Elia Kazan's eleventh film.In 1917 California, teenager Cal Trask (James Dean) journeys from Salinas to Monterey to confirm rumors that his thought-to-be-dead mother is alive and operating a brothel. The rumors prove to be true and he returns to Salinas with the secret. His brother, Aaron (Richard Davalos), has a highly idealized notion of his mother and imagines his girlfriend, Abra (Julie Harris), will measure up to this archetype. Cals' father, Adam (Raymond Massey), is a stern, religious man who clearly favors his dutiful son, Aaron over the more free-spirited Cal.When Adam devises a scheme of shipping lettuce packed in ice via rail to the East, Cal helps out in an effort to win his father's affection but the entire shipment is ruined when the train tracks are blocked by a snowslide. With America on the brink of entering World War I and the cost of agricultural products expected to soar, Cal asks his mother, Kate (Jo Van Fleet), for a loan to invest in a bean crop to recoup his father's financial loss. Kate reveals to Cal that she had left Adam because she could not tolerate his rigidness.As Cal and Abra become increasingly attracted to each other, Cal arranges a surprise birthday party for Adam and presents him with his speculation profits as a gift, which Adam rejects as war profiteering. Cal is crushed but is consoled by Abra. When Aaron warns Cal to stay away from her, a spiteful Cal takes him to Monterey to show him the truth about his mother. In reaction, Aaron gets drunk and enlists in the Army. Adam runs down to the train station just as Aaron departs and suffers a stroke. With Adam near death, Abra pleads with him to reach out to the son he never loved. Adam asks Cal to nurse him and an eleventh-hour bond is formed between the two men.East of Eden is based on the last third of John Steinbeck's popular novel by the same name. Kazan was attracted to the struggles between Adam and Cal which mirrored the strained relationship with his own father. The story, loosely based on the biblical story of Cain and Abel, also appealed to Kazan because it challenged the popular notions of good and evil.The film was James Dean's screen debut. Kazan revealed in later interviews and writings that Dean was mentally unstable, an emotional invalid always on the verge of crying, which meant he was perfect for the role of brooding, frustrated, insecure Cal. Dean's Oscar-nominated performance is both amazing and amateurish at the same time. Critics and fans promptly crowned Dean the new Brando but Kazan dismissed such comparisons as ridiculous. Julie Harris is absolutely wonderful. What a performance! Kazan credits her with getting Dean through the picture. However, asking the audience to suspend belief and accept 24-year-old Dean and 28-year-old Harris as teenagers is a bit of a stretch. At times, the cheesecloth over the lens on Harris's scenes becomes annoyingly thick. Van Fleet deservedly won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Massey is stiff as a board, just like his character. The stories of how Kazan stoked the personal antagonism between Dean and Massey to augment their performances are legendary. Burl Ives always plays a good part. Leonard Rosenman's score is catchy and then becomes like Chinese water torture. East of Eden was filmed in CinemaScope and Kazan created some remarkable wide-pan shots. He was nominated for Best Director and Paul Osborn's script was nominated for Best Screenplay.East of Eden was extremely successful especially among teens who related to Cal's fractured relationship with his father. It was the very first film to capture 1950's teen angst. East of Eden launched Dean to stardom but he died in a tragic automobile accident before his next two movies were released.This two-disc DVD has a fine commentary by film critic and Kazan expert, Richard Schickel. Bonus features include the documentaries, Forever James Dean (1988) and East of Eden: Art in Search of Life. Also included are additional scenes, screen tests, wardrobe tests, and footage from the New York premier. The DVD is nicely packaged with an outer sleeve.East of Eden is certainly one of Kazan's better films but it doesn't quite measure up to On the Waterfront or Streetcar Named Desire.",4,Elia Kazan tackles father & son,1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,4297,"['East', 'Eden', 'Warner', 'Bros.', '1955', 'was', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'eleventh', 'film.In', '1917', 'California', 'teenager', 'Cal', 'Trask', 'James', 'Dean', 'journeys', 'Salinas', 'Monterey', 'confirm', 'rumors', 'thought-to-be-dead', 'mother', 'alive', 'operating', 'brothel', 'rumors', 'prove', 'be', 'true', 'Salinas', 'secret', 'brother', 'Aaron', 'Richard', 'Davalos', 'highly', 'idealized', 'notion', 'mother', 'imagines', 'girlfriend', 'Abra', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'will', 'measure', 'up', 'archetype', 'Cals', 'father', 'Adam', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'stern', 'religious', 'man', 'who', 'clearly', 'dutiful', 'son', 'Aaron', 'more', 'free-spirited', 'Cal.When', 'Adam', 'scheme', 'shipping', 'lettuce', 'packed', 'ice', 'rail', 'East', 'Cal', 'out', 'effort', 'win', 'father', 'affection', 'entire', 'shipment', 'ruined', 'when', 'train', 'tracks', 'are', 'blocked', 'snowslide', 'America', 'brink', 'entering', 'World', 'War', 'cost', 'agricultural', 'products', 'expected', 'soar', 'Cal', 'mother', 'Kate', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'loan', 'invest', 'bean', 'crop', 'recoup', 'father', 'financial', 'loss', 'Kate', 'reveals', 'Cal', 'had', 'left', 'Adam', 'could', 'not', 'tolerate', 'rigidness.As', 'Cal', 'Abra', 'become', 'increasingly', 'attracted', 'other', 'Cal', 'surprise', 'birthday', 'party', 'Adam', 'speculation', 'profits', 'gift', 'Adam', 'war', 'profiteering', 'Cal', 'crushed', 'consoled', 'Abra', 'When', 'Aaron', 'Cal', 'stay', 'away', 'spiteful', 'Cal', 'Monterey', 'show', 'truth', 'mother', 'reaction', 'Aaron', 'drunk', 'enlists', 'Army', 'Adam', 'down', 'train', 'station', 'just', 'Aaron', 'departs', 'suffers', 'stroke', 'Adam', 'death', 'Abra', 'reach', 'out', 'son', 'never', 'loved', 'Adam', 'Cal', 'nurse', 'eleventh-hour', 'bond', 'formed', 'two', 'men.East', 'Eden', 'based', 'last', 'third', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'popular', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Kazan', 'was', 'attracted', 'struggles', 'Adam', 'Cal', 'mirrored', 'strained', 'relationship', 'own', 'father', 'story', 'loosely', 'based', 'biblical', 'story', 'Cain', 'Abel', 'also', 'appealed', 'Kazan', 'challenged', 'popular', 'notions', 'good', 'evil.The', 'film', 'was', 'James', 'Dean', 'screen', 'debut', 'Kazan', 'revealed', 'later', 'interviews', 'writings', 'Dean', 'was', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'emotional', 'invalid', 'always', 'verge', 'crying', 'meant', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'brooding', 'frustrated', 'insecure', 'Cal', 'Dean', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'amazing', 'amateurish', 'same', 'time', 'Critics', 'fans', 'promptly', 'crowned', 'Dean', 'new', 'Brando', 'Kazan', 'dismissed', 'such', 'comparisons', 'ridiculous', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'What', 'performance', 'Kazan', 'getting', 'Dean', 'picture', 'However', 'asking', 'audience', 'suspend', 'belief', 'accept', '24-year-old', 'Dean', '28-year-old', 'Harris', 'teenagers', 'bit', 'stretch', 'times', 'cheesecloth', 'lens', 'Harris', 'scenes', 'annoyingly', 'thick', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Massey', 'stiff', 'board', 'just', 'character', 'stories', 'how', 'Kazan', 'stoked', 'personal', 'antagonism', 'Dean', 'Massey', 'augment', 'performances', 'are', 'legendary', 'Burl', 'always', 'good', 'part', 'Leonard', 'Rosenman', 'score', 'catchy', 'then', 'Chinese', 'water', 'torture', 'East', 'Eden', 'was', 'filmed', 'CinemaScope', 'Kazan', 'created', 'remarkable', 'wide-pan', 'shots', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Osborn', 'script', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Screenplay.East', 'Eden', 'was', 'extremely', 'successful', 'especially', 'teens', 'who', 'related', 'Cal', 'fractured', 'relationship', 'father', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'film', 'capture', '1950', 'teen', 'angst', 'East', 'Eden', 'launched', 'Dean', 'stardom', 'died', 'tragic', 'automobile', 'accident', 'next', 'two', 'movies', 'were', 'released.This', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'fine', 'commentary', 'film', 'critic', 'Kazan', 'expert', 'Richard', 'Schickel', 'Bonus', 'include', 'documentaries', 'Forever', 'James', 'Dean', '1988', 'East', 'Eden', 'Art', 'Search', 'Life', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'additional', 'scenes', 'screen', 'tests', 'wardrobe', 'tests', 'footage', 'New', 'York', 'premier', 'DVD', 'nicely', 'packaged', 'outer', 'sleeve.East', 'Eden', 'certainly', 'one', 'Kazan', 'better', 'films', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'Waterfront', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire']",N/A

231452,A31D8QKJXU93BT,6300267865,"Vince Perrin ""Byline""","[5, 6]","Director Elia Kazan has filmed only the last fifty pages of John Steinbeck's hugely popular 800-page novel, has cast it with excellent stage actors then largely unknown to movie audiences, and has used the new (at the time) widescreen camera for the first time as a daring artistic tool. By no means are these the only reasons why ""East of Eden"" remains one of Kazan's greatest achievements and a classic of American cinema. But they do help to explain why the picture endures today.Truly great themes are rarely found in Hollywood films, but this one attempts nothing less than the ambiguity of good and evil, especially as it is displayed in the American character; the suffocating notion of sin and salvation; and the retelling of the Bible's Cain and Abel tale on the eve of America's entry into The Great War. The effect is like watching a game of three-dimensional chess played by Sigmund Freud and Lee Strasberg in a lettuce patch somewhere between Salinas and Monterey.This is the movie that famously introduced James Dean in the finest of his three film performances, one that defined a generation and how youth is now depicted on screen. His raw emotion and feral soul are unforgetable. So is the work of Julie Harris as his understanding girl friend, Raymond Massey as his unloving father, and the uncanny Jo Van Fleet in her Oscar-winning role as his madam mother (Kazan was later to cast her in ""Wild River""). In other roles, Burl Ives, Richard Davalos, Lois Smith, Albert Dekker and Barbara Baxley make vivid impressions.Certain scenes between Dean and Harris linger with you long afterwards: the pair picnicking in a mustard field, discovering their mutual affection atop a ferris wheel, hosting a disastrous birthday party (with its psychologically cruel aftermath), and coming to terms with his stroke-stricken father. Screen acting doesn't get any better than this. Steinbeck and Kazan were friends and collaborators; the author must have been enormously pleased.It is so good to have this DVD, and in a special two-disc edition, that it seems unkind to notice the sometimes fuzzy color transfer and sound recording, although Leonard Rosenman's score, with it's pre-credits overture and haunting love theme, is still lovely. And is it ungrateful to dislike the tentative and speculative commentary by critic Richard Schickel? He rates it very high but his remarks throughout often disparage the film.

Coming into the film I knew it would be nothing short of a masterpiece, given the director (Elia Kazan is a favorite of mine, with A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront being two of my favorite films of all time). Overall it achieves a blissful state of realism with its acting (Kazan's always had a way with actors) featuring multiple stand-out performances, including a haunting Julie Harris and an Oscar-winning Jo Van Fleet. The story about the complexities of what is ""good"" and what is ""evil,"" based on John Steinbeck's novel of the same name, is classic, ringing true and even alluding to the Bible. So the film was good, but how was James Dean?I've heard time and again that Dean was no more than an aspiring Brando. Now that I've seen his acting for myself I can now understand the claims, but I'm going to have to disagree. Dean brings something more unique, more youthful, and more innocent to his performance than Brando would have if he had been cast as planned till age became an issue. Image-wise Dean is liberating, allowing a cinematic ""tough male"" persona to exude femininity and sensitivity, maintaining the character's independence without acting brutish or rebellious in a stereotypical sense. Though his performance reminded me a bit of Brando's in On the Waterfront, one must take into consideration how young Dean was and that his three films (Eden, Rebel Without a Cause, and Giant) were just the beginning, and unfortunately the end, of his career: his work which can be seen will be a bit affected (not significantly) like all actors who are just beginning to gain recognition, and with that recognition more demanding roles. Ultimately, if I were AMPAS in the year of Eden I would nominate Dean for Best Actor. No matter any new comer flaws, it's a stellar performance and I'm glad to have finally been exposed to such an icon of teenage independence.
