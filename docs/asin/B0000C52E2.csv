When their dad goes home to check on them, they think a burglar is trying to break in!Between A Rock and A Bra Place- Lizzie's mom wants to help the girls shop for the first bras, which embarrasses LizzieRated Aarghh!- Lizzie and her friends want to sneak into an R-rated movie after their parents won't let them goParty Over Here- Lizzie and her friends sneak out to Kate Sander's birthday party after their parents say they can't goBonus features:&#34;I Can't Wait&#34; music video by Hilary Duff, featuring a montage of clips from episodes of Lizzie McGuire",5,Love Lizzie,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,923,"['disc', 'best', 'episodes', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'think', 'are', 'relatable', 'teens', 'as', 'well', 'episodes', 'disc', 'deal', 'real-life', 'issues', 'teens', 'experience', 'such', 'getting', 'first', 'bras', 'seeing', 'R-rated', 'movie', 'babysitting', 'going', 'grown-up', 'party.Episodes', 'Misadventures', 'Babysitting-', 'Miranda', 'Gordo', 'help', 'Lizzie', 'babysit', 'Matt', 'When', 'dad', 'home', 'check', 'think', 'burglar', 'trying', 'break', 'A', 'Rock', 'A', 'Bra', 'Place-', 'Lizzie', 'mom', 'help', 'girls', 'shop', 'first', 'bras', 'LizzieRated', 'Aarghh', 'Lizzie', 'friends', 'want', 'sneak', 'R-rated', 'movie', 'parents', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'goParty', 'Here-', 'Lizzie', 'friends', 'sneak', 'out', 'Kate', 'Sander', 'birthday', 'party', 'parents', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'goBonus', 'features', '34', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Wait', '34', 'music', 'video', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'featuring', 'montage', 'clips', 'episodes', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire']",N/A

It's one of the cutest episodes, in which Lizzie gets a job and learns that work is really hard, and also learns a lesson about the value of $. It starts when she asks for a raise in allowance, looking really cute and begging her mom and dad, smiling oh so sweetly, and then when her mom disagrees, resorting to the sad eyes. How can you say no to the sad eyes? But her mom did, and off storms Elizabeth Brooke who is determined to prove to her parents that she can be responsible and earn her own money.
