1534161,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007M8SAFK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 11]","I'm almost ashamed to admit how much I like Daniel Tosh and his brutally funny Comedy Central endeavor ""Tosh.0.""  A lot of TV programs have skewered web content and brought us the gnarliest, stupidest, and funniest clips that can be found on the Internet.  Usually, though, I'm not a big fan of this type of programming.  When anyone will act a moron for a moment of perceived fame, it becomes increasingly difficult to support idiots acting like idiots.  Of course, that's not all ""Tosh.0"" offers, but that's its primary focal point.  The difference in this show comes from the man himself.  Daniel Tosh just may be the blue-eyed, smirking devil in disguise. Tosh's particular brand of humor leans to wry and intelligent smut. He straddles the line of good taste and oftentimes falls on the wrong, but hilarious, side of polite humor.  He is relentless, merciless, but never alienating (ok, maybe sometimes).  He is a jerk, to be sure, but a charming host as well.  And as he rips into his weekly targets, conducts an interview, or performs a skit--I'm willing to follow him just about anywhere.I was, therefore, ecstatic when I heard they were releasing ""Tosh.0: Hoodies"" on DVD.  But it's been almost impossible to find out what would be included.  It seems that Comedy Central will be launching the whole series (currently in the fourth season) and each volume will be represented by a different item of clothing.  It seems only natural that we kick things off with the famed hoodie!  ""Hoodies"" will contain the first ten episodes of Season One from 2009.  The are:(1) Afro Ninja, (2) Miss Teen South Carolina, (3) News Puke Kid, (4) Scarlet Takes a Tumble, (5) Leave Britney Alone!, (6) Billoon45, (7) Worst Best Man Speech, (8) Reh Dogg, (9) Drunk Dunk, and (10) and Skateboard Girl.If you are familiar with ""Tosh.0,"" the episode title is generally related to who gets a web redemption courtesy of Tosh.  That means that someone who was embarrassed by a viral video has an opportunity to sit down with Tosh and have a bit of fun.  If you are not familiar with the program, though, I'd suggest you catch a few episodes before investing in a purchase.  The show may not be for everyone, so check out the Comedy Central reruns--they're on all the time!  And while you do that, I say bring on more Tosh!

One of his quips about the DVD was that it contains the first 10 episodes, not the entire first 16-episode season; hence the name ""Hoodies"" for the DVD to classify the release(s) ""by wardrobe"" instead of by season. His best jest on the DVD release was in typical, Daniel Tosh sarcastic form: He said, ""You can finally buy Tosh.0 on [DVD and] Blu Ray. It's about time, because Comedy Central refuses to ever rerun this show.""Funny he said that, because ""why would anyone need to buy this"" was the first thing that I thought when I found out about the DVD last week. Well, I suppose if you don't get Comedy Central there is something here for you. Or if you just want to collect these hilarious, fresh, Tosh.0 perspectives on Internet videos there is something here for you. And certainly if you want to see some of the funniest comedy you'll ever see there is something here for you too.So my guess: This DVD will sell some copies regardless of the fact that the shows are indeed repeated and repeated and repeated over and over again on Comedy Central.
