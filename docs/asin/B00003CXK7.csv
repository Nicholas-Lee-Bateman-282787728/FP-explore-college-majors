Something in the tradition of  &quot;American Pie&quot;. Instead we watched what might turn out to be the  worst movie of the year! This movie is just about as funny as &quot;Last  Tango In Paris&quot; is. Anyone expecting Jason Biggs to turn in another  extremely funny performances like he did in &quot;American Pie&quot; will  be disappointed. And in no way is Mena Suvari as sexy as she was in  &quot;American Beauty&quot;. The best character here is Greg Kinnear's. But  does anyone really care? To say he had the best role in the movie isn't  really saying much! Amy Heckerling has always managed to make funny movies.  I'm not saying all of them were great movies,but there was always something  to laugh at,right now I'm thinking about &quot;Clueless&quot; and  &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot;. I have no idea what she was thinking when  she made this,but I'm sorry she did.

527553,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXK7,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","After the success of `American Pie', Jason Biggs was everywhere, and one of the places he showed up was in this 2000 modern spin on the 1960 Oscar winning film `The Apartment'.  Yes, this is very much `The Apartment' set in school, and shockingly this is not as much of an insult to the '60 classic as I would have expected.Don't get me wrong; `The Apartment' is one of the best films of all time, and `Loser' isn't even one of the best films of 2000, but as far as quirky teenage romantic comedies go, this one actually gets a lot right.Paul is, well, a loser.  He is a social retard who happens to get a scholarship to a nice college in the city.  Everyone he knows takes total advantage of him, but he's such a nice guy that he constantly allows it.  When he meets, and falls in love with, Dora (a young student  having an affair with her lit professor) he seems to step out of his shell and become his own person, but his interest in Dora is tested with that creepy guy she's sleeping with starts stepping all over his toes.Biggs is pitch perfect for the role.  I mean, he makes for the perfect dorky romantic lead since he's kind of dorky, but in that Zach Braff `I'm not that attractive yet my geeky sense of humor makes girls love me' kind of way.  I love Mena Suvari and consider her to one of those underrated young actresses who has it all and doesn't get enough opportunities to showcase it (her stunningly astute turn in `American Beauty' should have gotten her Oscar attention) and here she shows why she is so lovable.  She just GETS it, and it shows in her eyes.  She isn't just simply playing a role the way that most actresses would have thrown this one away.  She lives it, and that dedication is admirable, especially when it's coming from a film like `Loser'.Oh yeah, and for me Greg Kinnear can do no wrong (or very little wrong) and I just gobble him up here.So, if you are looking for a funny, entertaining and sweetly charming teen comedy that actually knows its humor and its audience and serves up the goods then `Loser' has your DVD player written all over it.And for the record, he totally should have went with `The Piano'!",4,This one actually ISN'T a dud!,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,2152,"['success', 'American', 'Pie', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'was', 'everywhere', 'one', 'places', 'showed', 'up', 'was', '2000', 'modern', 'spin', '1960', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'film', 'Apartment', 'Yes', 'very', 'much', 'Apartment', 'set', 'school', 'shockingly', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'insult', ""'60"", 'classic', 'would', 'have', 'expected.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Apartment', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'Loser', ""n't"", 'even', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2000', 'as', 'far', 'quirky', 'teenage', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'go', 'one', 'actually', 'lot', 'right.Paul', 'well', 'loser', 'social', 'retard', 'who', 'get', 'scholarship', 'nice', 'college', 'city', 'Everyone', 'total', 'advantage', 'such', 'nice', 'guy', 'constantly', 'When', 'love', 'Dora', 'young', 'student', 'having', 'affair', 'lit', 'professor', 'step', 'out', 'shell', 'become', 'own', 'person', 'interest', 'Dora', 'tested', 'creepy', 'sleeping', 'starts', 'stepping', 'toes.Biggs', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'role', 'mean', 'perfect', 'dorky', 'romantic', 'lead', 'kind', 'dorky', 'Zach', 'Braff', ""'m"", 'not', 'attractive', 'yet', 'geeky', 'sense', 'humor', 'girls', 'love', 'kind', 'way', 'love', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'consider', 'one', 'underrated', 'young', 'actresses', 'who', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'opportunities', 'showcase', 'stunningly', 'astute', 'turn', 'American', 'Beauty', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'Oscar', 'attention', 'here', 'why', 'so', 'lovable', 'just', 'GETS', 'eyes', ""n't"", 'just', 'simply', 'playing', 'role', 'way', 'most', 'actresses', 'would', 'have', 'thrown', 'one', 'away', 'dedication', 'admirable', 'especially', 'when', 'coming', 'film', ""Loser'.Oh"", 'yeah', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'very', 'little', 'wrong', 'just', 'gobble', 'up', 'here.So', 'are', 'looking', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'sweetly', 'charming', 'teen', 'comedy', 'actually', 'humor', 'audience', 'up', 'goods', 'then', 'Loser', 'DVD', 'player', 'written', 'it.And', 'record', 'totally', 'should', 'have', 'went', 'Piano']",Loser

Although I like the movie, there were some weird things going on. For instance, why did Dora (Mena Suvari) agree to go on a date with Paul (Jason Biggs) when she already had a boyfriend? There were also a lot of loose ends, like when Dora was trying to get financial aid, she couldn't get it because she didn't have a residence. Didn't she miss her subway home earlier in the movie? If she didn't have a residence, then where was she going?Aside from all that, the movie is pretty watchable. A lot of things that happen to Paul probably wouldn't happen in real life'at least, I hope not. And this movie is more of a comedy-drama than a straight comedy, so keep that in mind before you see it.

527556,A24456FPYCCSMG,B00003CXK7,Ben hayden,"[1, 2]",When i think of smart teen comedies i automatically think of Director Amy  Heckerling and movies such as fast Times At Ridgemont High and Clueless.  Heckerling has the ability to weave the same old characters the cliches and  the story into cinematic gold. With Loser she dosn't lose much of that  ability although i found it to be a little less funny than i thought.Loser is about Paul played by Jason Biggs who goes to college in New  York City and he is worried that he won't fit in and he has right to worry  so his roommates say. While there he meets Dora played by Mena Suvari who  is a bar waitress who is the only person he is able to talk to who is also  having an affair with a pretentious Lit Professer played by Greg  Kinnear.Yes in the hands of an unknown director this would have been a  lame old romance with few laughs. Jason Biggs is perfect for the role as a  Loser with his reactions he is able to be very convincing. Mena Suvari is  very charming Greg Kinnear is perfectly smug and the three roommates are  very funny really the entire cast is very funny. Although not as funny as  Clueless.

527557,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B00003CXK7,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[10, 13]","Amy Heckerling's latest teen comedy, 'Loser', is an old-fashioned charmer where nice guys finish first, sweet girls end up making the right choices, and pushy 'users' get their just desserts! Perhaps nobility is passe in films today, but 'Loser' makes a great case for working class heroes who succeed by 'doing the right thing'.Paul Tannek (Jason Biggs) is a farm boy who wins a scholarship to a college in New York City. Bright, awkward, and shy, and possessing the worst haircut since Adam Sandler's in 'Little Nicky', he accepts his family's celebration of his success with embarrassment, and a fear of failure, but his father (Dan Aykroyd, who is wonderful in his brief scenes) offers simple advice: &quot;Listen to people, look them in the eye. Be a friend, and you'll succeed.&quot;Cut to New York City (which has never looked more beautiful), and Paul's worst fears are coming true. His dress is ridiculed, his roommates are 'too cool' jerks who take advantage of him while dissing him, and his instructors, particularly Professor Alcott (Greg Kinnear, at his smarmiest!) snub him imperiously. Paul is lonely and frustrated, which makes a simple act of kindness by fellow student Dora Diamond (Mena Suvari, in her best performance, to date) take on special significance to him. Diamond is a kindred spirit, although she has been manipulated into believing Professor Alcott loves her, and has become his clandestine lover.As both of their lives take downward turns (he gets thrown out of his dorm, she loses her waitress job), they develop a platonic friendship (he is far too much a gentleman to attempt to break up a relationship!). He becomes her 'guardian angel', protecting her, and the film becomes a guessing game of when she will finally realize they belong together!'Loser' features a lot of very funny cameos, by Andy Dick, David Spade, Andrea Martin, Colleen Camp, many others, and, to Heckerling's credit, these 'guests' never detract from the positive message of the film.This makes a great date movie (particularly if your date loves kittens!), and is a 'feel-good' flick you can enjoy again and again!

527562,A3OUNPPWYVAWIH,B00003CXK7,Chris Maverick,"[0, 0]","Perhaps the title I gave this review is a tad unfair. Loser is actually a very fun movie. I enjoyed it. It took me back to my freshmen year of college. It made me think fondly about crushes I had on girls, problems I had with teachers, not having enough financial aid and the idiot students that shouldn't even be able to pass a litmus test much less a college entrance exam. I identified with this movie. My inner college student identified with it the same way my inner high school student identified with &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High.&quot;However, &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; and &quot;Clueless&quot; (Amy Heckerling's other major blockbuster) have a special humor that &quot;Loser&quot; is lacking. In truth, I identified with &quot;Loser&quot; much more than I did with &quot;Clueless&quot;, however the script is much more subdued. In some ways, this is a good thing. After Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari both achieved critical acclaim with their breakout roles in &quot;American Pie&quot; and went on to star in the likes of  &quot;Boys and Girls&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot; respectively, its nice to see that they are dynamic enough in their ranges as actors to perform in a simple, more subdued film.This movie is just that. Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love with girl. Girl doesn't notice how sweet boy is. Boy attempts to sacrifice his own happiness for the girls sake. Girl and boy eventually end up together. I'm sorry if I have spoiled anything for you, but trust me, you've seen this film before. You've seen this film many times. You know the entire story the first time you see the sweet and lovable doofus look into the eyes of the cool and outrageous babe. You're supposed to know. It isn't the plot that's important here.

If Loser had maybe tried something different and not gone the same way as all the other teen movies in the past 3 years, I would of enjoyed it more. I still found Biggs and Suvari entertaining as a couple, but Suvari surprisingly over-does her character in many scenes, while Greg Kinnear gives a dumb performance as the bastard professor. The rest of the leading cast, Zak Orth, Thomas Sadoski and Jimmi Simpson aren't as funny or memorable as Jim Carrey's 3 sons in Me, Myself &amp; Irene. The film depicts college life unrealistically and much like Biggs' character, fall flats on its face.

527585,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B00003CXK7,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[2, 2]","A couple of years ago, Heckerling made critics stand up and take notice of teen movies once again with her fantastically witty, funny 'Clueless'.  Her next movie, 'Loser', seemed to go by pretty much unnoticed, surprising really given the director's and actors' credentials.  Basically this is a cute movie that is above average.  It's about a smalltown guy named Paul (Jason Biggs) who goes to university and finds out that everything he feared about university was true; he doesn't have any friends, finds it difficult to cope with the work etc.  Then he meets Dora (Mena Suvari), a grungy student that's carrying out an affair with one of her tutors (Greg Kinnear).  And so it goes as Paul tries to get the unattainable girl.First of all, there's much about this film to admire, and it's mostly clich&eacute;-free.  First of all there are the actors: Jason Biggs plays basically the same guy as he did in 'American Pie' so well, the goofy but loveable geek.  There's also Suvari, of 'American Beauty' fame, who is just fantastic in this role as an angst-ridden teen trying to make ends meet.  The supporting cast are also impressive.  It's also funny in several bits, and not in an obvious way - this is a movie whose characters almost seem to revel in their own oddities.  We've got Dora funding her course through harvesting her eggs and Paul teaching her the finer points of catching food in your mouth.However, the movie eventually goes for the easy option, straying into the territory of dreary teen movies like 'She's All That'.

527587,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00003CXK7,Only-A-Child,"[8, 8]","Although ""Loser"" is a solid effort and is generally enjoyable, it was certainly not what director Amy Heckerling needed at that point in her career. After the great success of ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and ""Clueless"" she pretty much went in the director dumper with this one. Ironically the problem was not her directing but her writing. Solid production could not entirely compensate for this flawed screenplay because the flaws are in the characters themselves, they are simply not believable.This is usually fatal because it is hard for viewers to care about characters with whom they cannot identify. Fortunately for writer Heckerling, director Heckerling cast the best two actors in ""American Pie"", Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari, as her leads. They have such unexpectedly good chemistry together that you will yourself to believe in them, even if Paul is moronically nice and Dora is moronically moronic (her failure to connect the bad relationship dots for almost the entire film is not consistent with a character who is portrayed as extremely perceptive and self-aware). Suvari looks and even sounds like Jennifer Jason Leigh which may have you flashing back to ""Fast Times"".Excellent performances by Biggs, Suvari, and Greg Kinnear (as Professor Alcott) save the day or at least salvage the film. They get little assistance from anyone else in Heckerling's cast (although Dan Ackroyd is decent in a small and very straight role) as the supporting players are either neutral or less than zero. Worst of all are they guys who play Paul's three roommates. They start out as typically ""Party Hard"" college students but overnight morph into date rape scum and academic blackmailers. Heckerling provides nothing to explain this transformation, which is especially strange because she includes early scenes intended to show that one of the roommates is sincerely trying to help Paul with his adjustment to college in the big city.Heckerling based her ""Clueless"" screenplay on Jane Austin's ""Emma"". Franz Kafka is her reference point for ""Loser""; a strange choice given Kafka famous line ""women are traps which lie in wait for men everywhere, in order to drag them down into the finite"". The choice of the Dora Diamond name is an obvious homage to Kafka's girlfriend Dora Dymant. The screenplay for ""Loser"" is not a total loss, it has good individual lines like: ""I love self-loathing complaint rock you can dance to"".Perhaps the best scene is Heckerling's homage to the Berkeley fountain scene in ""The Graduate"" as the dejected Paul wonders around the city while the soundtrack plays Simon and Garfunkel's ""Scarborough Fair"". The rest of the soundtrack is also good.Apparently Heckerling could not resist shooting herself in the foot at the very end as she included on-screen notes documenting the comeuppance received by each of the bad characters. Not only is this tired and unoriginal (""American Graffiti"" and ""Animal House"" made use of this along with a high school film I judged last spring) but the notes themselves are not even mildly amusing.Then again, what do I know?

Allen""","[0, 0]","I've actually had this movie for several years and rediscovered it a couple of days ago.This was a film that Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari did pretty early in their careers. I didn't think all that much of the film at first, but it really starts to grow on you. The story itself is a classic boy meets girl with some interesting twists and turns. The chemistry between Biggs and Suvari display a comfortability that looks as if their familiarity from American Pie carried over into this movie.The film has several scenes where Jason Biggs is acting just plain silly, but you are alright with that if you've seen many of his other films where he acts at least mildly goofy. He pulls it off well without looking like a total idiot. In a way, you find him adorable in that nerdy kind of way which in these days works really well. When I think of people who play nerdy and awkward well, I think of Michael Cera. However, it looks as if Cera took his cues from Jason as Biggs does it well here.Mena is cute and adorable as well in that sort of post punk, mildly sexy girl next door way. She comes off as a little too sweet at times, but it turned out alright. While some might look at this as a step down from her role in American Beauty, I don't see it as such a bad thing. It wasn't really her fault this film didn't do all too well at the box office. This movie was meant to be a ditzy and cute romcom and not a serious, Oscar worthy film. It looks as if it just came at a strange time as we the film industry was starting to move into a time when sci fi and raunchy comedies were a big thing.Greg Kinnear was passable as the obnoxious professor who tries too hard to be the cool guy. In some respects, it works for the film as his presence feels like it adds some additional star power to the film. Another good addition was Dan Aykroyd, playing the father of Biggs' character. As soon as I saw him on screen, it immediately lent even more credibility to the film.There are a few scenes that didn't play as well as had been intended. On series of events is when a cat gives birth to a litter of kittens. Continuity is skewered as that litter of kittens goes from being newborns to looking like 4 week olds in a matter of days. It was an obvious error, but then again it's not always easy to procure a fresh litter of kittens without risking the safety of them or their mother.While it's not an award winner, Loser is still a fun little play date in the sandbox.

A combination of horrible style choices and his unfamiliarity with different cultures doesn't earn him many friends. Sharing a dorm with three party animals (including Zak Orth and Jimmi Simspon), Paul is troubled by the late hours they keep and the language they speak. For example, this is how Orth informs Paul they're having pizza for dinner: ""We're ordering 'za, slap me a big head."" Obviously writer/director Amy Heckerling is trying to recapture the cutting edge teen slang she showcased in 'Clueless', but her efforts seem like a forced attempt to replicate that film's hipness. This isn't the only problem plaguing the film however. Paul meets a free spirited girl named Dora (Mena Suvari) in his English class. He's attracted to her but too shy to strike up a conversation. It is soon revealed that Dora is sleeping with their professor (Greg Kinnear). When Paul learns this he still tries to win her over in ways that are  ridiculous since a major part of the film is how broke him and Dora are. Paul blows his monthly savings on concert tickets to impress her and then buys her flowers but puts the professor's name on the card instead. It's typical romantic comedy crap that makes the film a chore to get through. You know Dora is going to come to her senses and realize what a great guy Paul is and how wrong the professor is for her. It's just that you have to wait for her to realize it which takes nearly the whole movie to get to that logical conclusion. When things do move in that direction so many coincidences occur one right after the other that the film is neither fun nor believable anymore. Biggs and Suvari are both talented actors and likable personalities so they work even when the material doesn't. Kinnear plays a jerk very well as his professor is such a self centered jerk you wonder why Dora is submissive towards him. The funnest performances come from Orth and Simpson as Paul's party monster roommates who do some shocking things to him and others.

Most of the other characters are intensely dislikable, and just about all the comedy is distinctly unfunny.Director Amy Heckerling previously directed two of the best teen films of the past two decades: FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH and CLUELESS. The latter was an inspired updating and adaptation of Jane Austen's EMMA. THE LOSER is also an adaptation, the plot of being borrowed fairly straightforward from Billy Wilder's THE APARTMENT. Bigges plays the Jack Lemmon role, Mena Suvari the Shirley MacLaine role, and Greg Kinnear the Fred MacMurray. The adaptation of Jane Austen worked in part because it was an inspired idea to reset EMMA in a Los Angeles high school in the 1990s, and in part because the script was so marvelous. The idea of resetting THE APARTMENT at NYU in the late 1990s fails in the first place because it is a really bad idea to remake one of cinema's greatest and funniest movies and in the second place because the script for the remake was so very, very unfunny. EMMA and CLUELESS were dissimilar as art forms (novel versus film) so that they didn't admit of very close comparison; THE APARTMENT and THE LOSER are both comic films set in NYC in the twentieth century, so they compare very easily. And, of course, THE APARTMENT makes THE LOSER look very, very bad indeed.But to be truthful, THE APARTMENT doesn't really make THE LOSER look much worse than it would have otherwise. It just isn't a very inspired film on any level. I liked the characters played by Bigges and Suvari, but after that, there wasn't really anything else recommending the film. In particular, Greg Kinnear's superficial, sadistic, and self-centered professor was especially damaging to the film.So, instead of watching this miserable remake of THE APARTMENT, just go watch THE APARTMENT again instead.",2,Likable leads can't overcome otherwise dreadful film,1027123200,"07 20, 2002",2002,1963,"['Jason', 'Bigges', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'likable', 'film', 'once', 'have', 'noted', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'else', 'good', 'say', 'film', 'Most', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'intensely', 'dislikable', 'just', 'comedy', 'distinctly', 'unfunny.Director', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'previously', 'directed', 'two', 'best', 'teen', 'films', 'past', 'two', 'decades', 'FAST', 'TIMES', 'AT', 'RIDGEMONT', 'HIGH', 'CLUELESS', 'latter', 'was', 'inspired', 'updating', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'EMMA', 'THE', 'LOSER', 'also', 'adaptation', 'plot', 'being', 'borrowed', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'THE', 'APARTMENT', 'Bigges', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'role', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'role', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'worked', 'part', 'was', 'inspired', 'idea', 'reset', 'EMMA', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'high', 'school', '1990s', 'part', 'script', 'was', 'so', 'marvelous', 'idea', 'resetting', 'APARTMENT', 'NYU', 'late', '1990s', 'fails', 'first', 'place', 'really', 'bad', 'idea', 'remake', 'one', 'cinema', 'greatest', 'funniest', 'movies', 'second', 'place', 'script', 'remake', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'unfunny', 'EMMA', 'CLUELESS', 'were', 'dissimilar', 'art', 'forms', 'novel', 'versus', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'admit', 'very', 'close', 'comparison', 'THE', 'APARTMENT', 'THE', 'LOSER', 'are', 'comic', 'films', 'set', 'NYC', 'twentieth', 'century', 'compare', 'very', 'easily', 'course', 'APARTMENT', 'THE', 'LOSER', 'look', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'indeed.But', 'be', 'truthful', 'APARTMENT', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'THE', 'LOSER', 'look', 'much', 'worse', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'inspired', 'film', 'level', 'liked', 'characters', 'played', 'Bigges', 'Suvari', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'else', 'recommending', 'film', 'particular', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'superficial', 'sadistic', 'self-centered', 'professor', 'was', 'especially', 'damaging', 'film.So', 'instead', 'watching', 'miserable', 'remake', 'THE', 'APARTMENT', 'just', 'go', 'watch', 'THE', 'APARTMENT', 'again', 'instead']",Loser

Loser rebuilds your  faith that there is actually life after high school comedies.  Obvisously  many people will have the expectations that the movie is asking the  audience to laugh at Jason Bigg's character Paul, and (duh) think that he  is a Loser, when really the movie is showing how shallow and what losers  are people who arn't themselves.",4,The next step up from Clueless,966643200,"08 19, 2000",2000,776,"['two', 'golden', 'gems', 'high', 'school', 'clueless', 'fast', 'times', 'ridgemont', 'high', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'had', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'characters', 'perspective', 'teenagers', 'post-modern', 'society', 'perfect', 'More', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Clueless', 'Loser', 'shines', 'heart', 'confidence', 'movie', ""n't"", 'promote', 'comedy', 'more', 'romantic', 'dramedy', 'losing', 'perceptive', 'Loser', 'faith', 'actually', 'life', 'high', 'school', 'comedies', 'Obvisously', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'expectations', 'movie', 'asking', 'audience', 'laugh', 'Jason', 'Bigg', 'character', 'Paul', 'duh', 'think', 'Loser', 'when', 'really', 'movie', 'showing', 'how', 'shallow', 'what', 'losers', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'ar', ""n't""]",Loser

It was also superbly directed by Amy Heckerling (Clueless, Look Who's Talking), and I watched it more than once.Jason Biggs gave one of his best performances. He basically plays an extremely naive guy who moves to NY to go to college, and he dosen't quite fit in. He meets a lovely young girl who is having an affair with one of her college professors.

527597,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00003CXK7,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","""Loser"" ....  What an unappealing title!  That's what I thought first, and still I believe that with another word(s), the film could have received better chance of being watched.  At least, it's Amy Heckerling's film, and she is the director of terrific ""Clueless.""  But THAT was a clueless title, too.""Loser"" is, of course, a blaff title, and Jason Biggs's character Paul, coming from country to New York City with a prop borrowed  from ""Fargo,"" finally wins.  Wins the heart of Dora (lovely, cute Mena Suvari), and supposed to win our heart, too.  But before that, he let himself suffer too much, and that's the point we find it hard to accept.  During the first several days of some college life in New York City, Paul, being too nice, finds his study interrupted by other noisy, party-loving roommates; finds his bed ruined by a broken waterbed; finds his textbook glued (by you know who); and, being fooled by them,  finds himself virtually evicted from the dorm to find his room among a hospital for cats and dogs.  Even Jason Biggs' good-natured personality cannot help there.But still, we know he is going to be a winner, and wait.  Here comes Dora, clad in a flashy costume but with a heart of diamond.  And waiting turns out worthwhile, for the chemisty between Mena Suvari and Jason Biggs is strong and hearty enough to carry the whole show.  Of course, they don't know each other well at first, but WE know they will be attracted to each other sooner or later.  Biggs & Suvari, both so good in ""American Pie"" (though they got different parters: Suvari with Chris Klein, and Biggs with ... pie), they deserve special mention here as one of the best couples that captured our heart on the big screen.Amy Heckerling, however, takes too much time before the final payoff.  Dora loves a pretentious college professor Greg Kinnear, who uses and wastes her love at every opportunity he can find.  The teacher-student relations have been explored in various forms in movie history (from Doris ""Teacher's Pet"" Day to Drew ""Never Been Kissed"" Barrymore), but Heckerling is brave in depicting this controversial relation straightforward.  But the film somehow ends up with unsatisfactory results, making selfish Prof. Kinnear just another foil he played several times since remake of ""Sabrina,"" and making Suvari look foolish to be deeply attracted to this unpleasant follow.  And worst of all is, hey, Paul, why do you help this guy out?With some moody photography of New York, ""Loser"" is a fairly enjoyable fare, but not without troubles.  But the two leads are so good and likable that if you like this kind of romatic film with slight comedy touch, you may love it.  I find it very hard to hate the film (though really wish I hadn't known Mena Suvari's marriage beforehand), and if not as good as ""Clueless,"" ""Loser"" is, in the long run, almost ""Winner.""  Almost.There's some cameo appearances including Dan Aykroyd and David Spade, but the original cast of Broadway musical ""Cavaret"" is a real treat.  Yes, it's the wrong act shown in the film, and Paul and Dora, who must have sneaked in the theater, are sitting at an expensive table!  Guys, you usually get caught before sitting there, I'm afraid, but, okay, I shut up, for we can briefly see Alan Cumming as Emcee.  And the inside of the subway is, according to my material at hand, shot in Toronto, because of Jason Biggs' tight schedule.",3,Almost Winner: Flawed But Hard to Dislike,1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,3399,"['Loser', 'What', 'unappealing', 'title', 'what', 'thought', 'first', 'still', 'believe', 'word', 's', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'received', 'better', 'chance', 'being', 'watched', 'least', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'film', 'director', 'terrific', 'Clueless', 'THAT', 'was', 'clueless', 'title', 'too', 'Loser', 'course', 'blaff', 'title', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'character', 'Paul', 'coming', 'country', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'prop', 'borrowed', 'Fargo', 'finally', 'heart', 'Dora', 'lovely', 'cute', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'supposed', 'win', 'heart', 'too', 'let', 'suffer', 'too', 'much', 'point', 'find', 'hard', 'accept', 'first', 'several', 'days', 'college', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Paul', 'being', 'too', 'nice', 'study', 'interrupted', 'other', 'noisy', 'party-loving', 'roommates', 'bed', 'ruined', 'broken', 'waterbed', 'textbook', 'glued', 'know', 'who', 'being', 'fooled', 'virtually', 'evicted', 'dorm', 'find', 'room', 'hospital', 'cats', 'dogs', 'Even', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'good-natured', 'personality', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'there.But', 'still', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'winner', 'wait', 'Here', 'Dora', 'clad', 'flashy', 'costume', 'heart', 'diamond', 'waiting', 'turns', 'out', 'worthwhile', 'chemisty', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'strong', 'hearty', 'enough', 'carry', 'whole', 'show', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'well', 'first', 'WE', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'attracted', 'other', 'sooner', 'later', 'Biggs', 'Suvari', 'so', 'good', 'American', 'Pie', 'got', 'different', 'parters', 'Suvari', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'Biggs', 'pie', 'deserve', 'special', 'mention', 'here', 'one', 'best', 'couples', 'captured', 'heart', 'big', 'screen.Amy', 'Heckerling', 'however', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'final', 'payoff', 'Dora', 'pretentious', 'college', 'professor', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'who', 'love', 'opportunity', 'can', 'find', 'teacher-student', 'relations', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'various', 'forms', 'movie', 'history', 'Doris', 'Teacher', 'Pet', 'Day', 'Drew', 'Never', 'Been', 'Kissed', 'Barrymore', 'Heckerling', 'brave', 'depicting', 'controversial', 'relation', 'straightforward', 'film', 'somehow', 'up', 'unsatisfactory', 'results', 'making', 'selfish', 'Prof.', 'Kinnear', 'just', 'foil', 'played', 'several', 'times', 'remake', 'Sabrina', 'making', 'Suvari', 'look', 'foolish', 'be', 'deeply', 'attracted', 'unpleasant', 'follow', 'worst', 'hey', 'Paul', 'why', 'do', 'help', 'guy', 'out', 'moody', 'photography', 'New', 'York', 'Loser', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'fare', 'not', 'troubles', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'likable', 'like', 'kind', 'romatic', 'film', 'slight', 'comedy', 'touch', 'may', 'love', 'find', 'very', 'hard', 'hate', 'film', 'really', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'known', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'marriage', 'beforehand', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Clueless', 'Loser', 'long', 'run', 'almost', 'Winner', 'Almost.There', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'including', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'David', 'Spade', 'original', 'cast', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'Cavaret', 'real', 'treat', 'Yes', 'wrong', 'act', 'shown', 'film', 'Paul', 'Dora', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'sneaked', 'theater', 'are', 'sitting', 'expensive', 'table', 'Guys', 'usually', 'get', 'caught', 'sitting', 'there', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'okay', 'shut', 'up', 'can', 'briefly', 'see', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'Emcee', 'inside', 'subway', 'according', 'material', 'hand', 'shot', 'Toronto', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'tight', 'schedule']",Loser
