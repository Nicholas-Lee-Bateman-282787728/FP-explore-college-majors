I say 'extra' because to my knowledge they never aired in the U.S.The sound and video quality are perfect and the story content was excellent.As for the extra feature... There are static text pages for each main character, no information that a fan like me didn't already know.What's missing?There are no subtitles in any language, there are no alternate audio tracks or commentaries, there are no featurettes.  I mean, come on! This show was groundbreaking in the field of computer animation.

Eliot, &quot;not with a bang but a whimper.&quot; The wonderful series that was ReBoot ends with both: the bang of the two full-length movies on this DVD, and the whimper from Frisket and ReBoot's gazillion fans. Why four stars? Five because it's ReBoot, and three because this DVD should be better than it is (averaging four stars). It looks like ReBoot has been listening to its critics, and that's a bad thing. After parodying every TV, movie and social situation, ReBoot is in danger of becoming a parody of itself.As we all know, season three was &quot;edgier&quot; than seasons one and two and formed a continuous story. But after reading my ReBoot Guide, a fan e-mailed me asking how to get the first two seasons. Why? He felt the third season was too &quot;edgy&quot; but wanted his kid to see how great ReBoot was (when it ran on ABC). V4.0 (this stands for &quot;version 4.0&quot; but Amazon calls it &quot;volume 4,&quot; confusing it with the fourth DVD of the third season) is &quot;edgier&quot; than the third season, as if someone has been reading bad graphic novels and got their puns from the ash can outside Comedy Central. Former ReBoot producer, Chris Brough, is not listed in the credits: perhaps his was the restraining hand that kept back such excesses. When it first appeared, ReBoot was widely hailed as fresh and new, and had nothing to prove. This ReBoot tries to prove it anyway, and it tries too hard. Oddly enough, ReBoot could still please everyone. Run these movies on Cartoon Network's Toonami or Adult Swim blocks, rerun the first two seasons on the teen or evening slots, and bring out the first two  seasons on DVD. Critics au contraire, ReBoot has always had something most other CGI series don't--soul. It's always been about Dot, Bob, Enzo, and (whimper)--oh yeah--Frisket.",4,A Bang and a Whimper,1084838400,"05 18, 2004",2004,1873,"['quot', 'way', 'world', 'quot', 'penned', 'T.S', 'Eliot', 'quot', 'not', 'bang', 'whimper.', 'quot', 'wonderful', 'series', 'was', 'ReBoot', 'bang', 'two', 'full-length', 'movies', 'DVD', 'whimper', 'Frisket', 'ReBoot', 'gazillion', 'fans', 'Why', 'four', 'stars', 'Five', 'ReBoot', 'three', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'better', 'averaging', 'four', 'stars', 'ReBoot', 'been', 'listening', 'critics', 'bad', 'thing', 'parodying', 'TV', 'movie', 'social', 'situation', 'ReBoot', 'danger', 'becoming', 'parody', 'itself.As', 'know', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'quot', 'quot', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'formed', 'continuous', 'story', 'reading', 'ReBoot', 'Guide', 'fan', 'e-mailed', 'asking', 'how', 'get', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Why', 'felt', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'too', 'quot', 'quot', 'wanted', 'kid', 'see', 'how', 'great', 'ReBoot', 'was', 'when', 'ran', 'ABC', 'V4.0', 'quot', 'version', '4.0', 'quot', 'Amazon', 'volume', '4', 'quot', 'confusing', 'fourth', 'DVD', 'third', 'season', 'quot', 'quot', 'third', 'season', 'someone', 'been', 'reading', 'bad', 'graphic', 'novels', 'got', 'puns', 'ash', 'can', 'outside', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Former', 'ReBoot', 'producer', 'Chris', 'Brough', 'not', 'listed', 'credits', 'perhaps', 'was', 'restraining', 'hand', 'kept', 'back', 'such', 'excesses', 'When', 'first', 'appeared', 'ReBoot', 'was', 'widely', 'hailed', 'fresh', 'new', 'had', 'nothing', 'prove', 'ReBoot', 'prove', 'anyway', 'too', 'hard', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'ReBoot', 'could', 'still', 'please', 'everyone', 'Run', 'movies', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Toonami', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'blocks', 'rerun', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'teen', 'evening', 'slots', 'bring', 'out', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'Critics', 'au', 'contraire', 'ReBoot', 'always', 'had', 'something', 'most', 'other', 'CGI', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'soul', 'always', 'been', 'Dot', 'Bob', 'Enzo', 'whimper', 'oh', 'yeah', 'Frisket']",N/A

Season four was very edgy with its content as was Season three, but pushing the envelope is what makes a show better.Four stars you wonder? I think the DVD could have been better.

They got me into the series and made me love the characters.  I hope they're released soon.  (I mean, wth? Where are the first two? Why start with 3?) Okay, now that I have that out of my system...This is an excellent collection.  You can't fault the DVD in any way.  They did a good job.  I have no problems with the way the DVD was put together.Now for the content.  This portion of the storyline is very cohesive.  It's edgy and fun.  Sometimes it seems like they try too hard, but other times, you see the early humor of the series come into play.  This portion ties up a lot of loose ends and questions that fans had, but it also creates new ones.
