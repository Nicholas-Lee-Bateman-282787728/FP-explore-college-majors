At first, I really did think there was a problem with my copy of the film...like a hole was being burned into it, a la the 8mm films of my youth. It's not so much the technique itself that's jarring...it's the fact that nothing else in the film suggests Mikhalkov is going to throw this metaphorical curveball at you.Also, I have to take seriously the criticism leveled against Mikhalkov here and other places on the web by residents of the ex-Soviet Union. It appears to be a mahority opinion among this community that:- The movie is Mikhalkov's blatant try at an Oscar nomination.- The dialogue is stilted and unreal.- The events themselves - as depicted - are a stretch of the imagination.Frankly, this criticism makes the movie all the more interesting.

The choice of content might actually have made a good film, in theory, but as it is, the only surefire way to improve Burnt By The Sun would have been not to make it. Upon dissection, every move Mikhalkov made here looks like nothing but a deliberate, calculated grab for the Academy Award. The emotional manipulativeness of the film is astoundingly shameless. First off, there are all the devices that are blatantly meant to draw nostalgic sighs and sentimental tears out of West-based emigres - the recurring Vertinsky waltz, the ornate dacha, the self-conscious quoting of Pushkin. Then there are the moves designed to win over the Western critics: for instance, that ridiculous, facile scene with the fireball moving through the house, which just _screams_ ""Look! Inscrutable brooding Russian symbolism, deep enough for an Academy Award!"" Then there's the cloyingly precious child; that always wins points with the audience. And of course, there's that disgustingly turgid ""symbol"" at the end - a balloon bearing a huge portrait of Stalin, rising out of nowhere and ""ominously looming over"" the setting. (Wait, Nikita? So you're saying that Stalin was ruthless? Good heavens, what a visionary! Oh, I never saw _that_ one coming!) It's as if Mikhalkov knew he had to remind the audience that the film actually had an Important Message, lest they had forgotten it in the preceding two hours. Crass beyond words.Am I being too cynical here? Hardly. Certainly no more than Mikhalkov; he wouldn't have made something this artless by accident. After all, if you remove from consideration the deliberate and unsubtle political message of the film, there is absolutely nothing left. The actor playing Mitya does exude a certain menace, but his efforts are wasted in his surroundings. Despite being the sole reason for all Mitya's deviousness, whoever plays Marusya gets no screen time at all aside from the obligatory sex scene and one brief scene with Mitya, in which she doesn't say more than five lines. Mikhalkov's character likewise never does anything of any importance - his most interesting appearance is when he starts tap dancing to impress his daughter, and that's mainly due to the incredulous laughter it causes. And, in fact, aside from Mitya and Mikhalkov's daughter, and Mikhalkov himself in the final scene, the characters in this film only put in short, obligatory appearances, apparently to break up the monotony. Unfortunately, they fail to do so, and the film, whose story could safely have been told in half an hour without leaving anything out, drags on and on for over two hours. The fact that Mikhalkov really did get the Academy Award (through yet another dishonest device - it was deliberately kept from theatrical release, and was privately screened only for the favourably inclined judges) is just depressing.",1,Thumbs down.,1034553600,"10 14, 2002",2002,2904,"['more', 'reflect', 'film', 'more', 'insincerity', 'bothers', 'choice', 'content', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'made', 'good', 'film', 'theory', 'only', 'surefire', 'way', 'improve', 'Burnt', 'Sun', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'make', 'dissection', 'move', 'Mikhalkov', 'made', 'here', 'nothing', 'deliberate', 'calculated', 'grab', 'Academy', 'Award', 'emotional', 'manipulativeness', 'film', 'astoundingly', 'shameless', 'First', 'off', 'are', 'devices', 'are', 'blatantly', 'meant', 'draw', 'nostalgic', 'sighs', 'sentimental', 'tears', 'West-based', 'emigres', 'recurring', 'Vertinsky', 'waltz', 'ornate', 'dacha', 'self-conscious', 'quoting', 'Pushkin', 'Then', 'are', 'moves', 'designed', 'win', 'Western', 'critics', 'instance', 'ridiculous', 'facile', 'scene', 'fireball', 'moving', 'house', 'just', '_screams_', 'Look', 'Inscrutable', 'brooding', 'Russian', 'symbolism', 'deep', 'enough', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Then', 'cloyingly', 'precious', 'child', 'always', 'points', 'audience', 'course', 'disgustingly', 'turgid', 'symbol', 'end', 'balloon', 'bearing', 'huge', 'portrait', 'Stalin', 'rising', 'nowhere', 'ominously', 'looming', 'over', 'setting', 'Wait', 'Nikita', 'So', ""'re"", 'saying', 'Stalin', 'was', 'ruthless', 'Good', 'heavens', 'what', 'visionary', 'Oh', 'never', 'saw', '_that_', 'one', 'coming', 'Mikhalkov', 'knew', 'had', 'remind', 'audience', 'film', 'actually', 'had', 'Important', 'Message', 'lest', 'had', 'forgotten', 'preceding', 'two', 'hours', 'Crass', 'words.Am', 'being', 'too', 'cynical', 'here', 'Hardly', 'Certainly', 'no', 'more', 'Mikhalkov', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'something', 'artless', 'accident', 'remove', 'consideration', 'deliberate', 'unsubtle', 'political', 'message', 'film', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'left', 'actor', 'playing', 'Mitya', 'exude', 'certain', 'menace', 'efforts', 'are', 'wasted', 'surroundings', 'being', 'sole', 'reason', 'Mitya', 'deviousness', 'whoever', 'Marusya', 'screen', 'time', 'aside', 'obligatory', 'sex', 'scene', 'one', 'brief', 'scene', 'Mitya', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'five', 'lines', 'Mikhalkov', 'character', 'likewise', 'never', 'anything', 'importance', 'most', 'interesting', 'appearance', 'when', 'tap', 'dancing', 'impress', 'daughter', 'mainly', 'due', 'incredulous', 'laughter', 'fact', 'aside', 'Mitya', 'Mikhalkov', 'daughter', 'Mikhalkov', 'final', 'scene', 'characters', 'film', 'only', 'put', 'short', 'obligatory', 'appearances', 'apparently', 'break', 'up', 'monotony', 'Unfortunately', 'fail', 'do', 'so', 'film', 'story', 'could', 'safely', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'hour', 'leaving', 'anything', 'out', 'drags', 'two', 'hours', 'fact', 'Mikhalkov', 'really', 'did', 'get', 'Academy', 'Award', 'yet', 'dishonest', 'device', 'was', 'deliberately', 'kept', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'privately', 'screened', 'only', 'favourably', 'inclined', 'judges', 'just', 'depressing']",Burnt By the Sun VHS

387107,A1E6JS6C205VZD,630386905X,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","This is an interestingly broken-backed film.  Set during the Stalinist era during one idyllic summer, it begins by contrasting the lives of Dmitriy (Oleg Menshikov) and Sergey (Nikita Mikhailkov) - the one a dilettante musician and pianist, the other a colonel in the Russian army and favorite of the premier.  They both have a claim on Marusya (Ingeborg Dapkunaite): Srgey is married to her, and Dmitriy was a former lover of hers.  It seems that the film's moral scheme is relatively straightorward: Dmitriy is talented but feckless, while Sergey seems virtualy untouchable - not only does he have a great career, but he is happily married as well.  However director Mikhailkov turns the tables on our expectations and thereby transforms BURNT BY THE SUN into a penetrating analysis of how dictatorships corrupt everyone around them.  Concepts of 'good' and 'evil# no longer prevail: everyone simply does what it takes in order to survive.  The ending is both shocking yet predictable.  Visually speaking, the film contrasts the idyllic surroundings of Dmitriy's dacha with the behavior of the protagonists - it seems that no one can actively enjoy the delights of glorious summer weather, for fear of being discovered.  Life at that time must have been precarious, with no one actually being sure as to what would happen to them next.  BURNT BY THE SUN is slow-moving, but Mikhailkov's camera has an eye for telling detail and significant gestures.

Directed and starring Nikita Mikhalkov who also co-wrote the screenplay with Rustam Ibragimbekov, this film allows us entry into the inside stories of Russia under Stalin.  It is an emotionally devastating tale.On the grounds of his dacha in 1936 revolutionary hero Colonel Kotov (Nikita Mikhalkov) cavorts in his sauna with his young daughter Nadya (Nadezhda Mikhalkova) and his elegantly beautiful young wife Marusia (Ingeborga Dapkunaite). Outside on the lawn is the rest of Kotov's family in a peaceful, sun-drenched summer garden, drinking, singing, and blissfully enjoying life in the country. On the vast horizon is a group of men assembling a balloon to honor Stalin, and a group of army tanks treads onto the wheat fields threatening to destroy the crops.  The townsfolk workers run for Kotov to rescue the situation, underlining the fact the Kotov is their hero from the revolution, much loved and respected.  Abruptly onto the scene comes the handsome young cousin Dimitri/Mitya (Oleg Menshikov), an ex-lover of Kotov's wife. He ingratiates himself with Nadia and the rest of the family as a pianist and singer, but there is a note of evil lurking.  Kotov understands the threat that Mitya's arrival indicates, that he has been betrayed and has become one of the many to be purged by Stalin.  But the life in the dacha remains leisurely and elegant until the fateful end when Mitya's mission is fulfilled.  The film ends with phrases telling us about the destinies of Kotov and his family up to the end of the purge after Stalin's death.The story is history: the telling is art.  Blest with a cast of extraordinary luminosity, Nikita Mikhalkov directs this tale of repression with style and leisurely pacing, such as allowing for moments at table when one of the grandmothers sings an aria from Puccini's 'Madama Butterfly', an aria whose text foreshadows the future of the story.  It is this contrast between the residual classy elegance of Russia before the revolution and the gritty reality of the cruelty of Stalinism that makes the film so resonant.  The cinematography by Vilen Kalyuta and the musical score by Eduard Artemyev  enhance the film immeasurably.  In Russian and French with English subtitles.  Highly Recommended.

I seriously doubt it. Here we have a truly great film masterpiece by Nikita Mikhalkov...that of General Serfei Kotov, a great hero of the revolution. He has always tried to live like and ideolize himself as a true upstanding communist and respected revolutionary war hero. He is with his family at his dacha, where other guests are present, vacationing, also. However, his bucholic lakeside ""visit"" moves from one of restful bliss to sheer and utter terror as he realizes he has become another victim of Stalin's supreme spying league. Interwoven are other details and bits of the lives of other characters. Absolutely one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever committed to film (think of the photography of ""Days of Heaven"")... just breathtaking to look at. The nature of the story makes it somewhat hard to discuss, in review here, without giving away more than one should, and I do not intend to make this review a ""Spoiler"".

What we get is a tumultuous day in the life of a theatre group in a tranquil rural community, lorded over by the proud Commander Kotov, as the small town prepares for the celebration of Stalin's first ride in an air balloon. Mikhalkov deftly mixes humor with pathos, the hallmark of all his movies, as the bucolic life is broken by the return of Mitya (impeccably played by Oleg Menshikov).  We slowly get to learn of Mitya's mission with a profound sense of foreboding.  The acting is purposely staged to give the scenes their rich theatrical air, yet there is a naturalism too, as Mikhalkov has such a fine eye for detail. To reveal too much of the movie is to give away its stunning climax.

It starts off and maintains the facade of being some light russian comedy that just happens to take place during the late thirties Communist mass murders and show trials when the  Party decided to destroy the Red Army and thus leave Russia helpless before  Hitler.  One thinks that-oh no another film that portrays life in a  Communist country as being just one great lark with the only dark spot  being the odd communist with no sense of humor.  That is not the case.  Mikhalkov is showing the wonderful life and people of precommunist  Russia-the eccentrics, the artists, the close family bonds, the common  people-in short, the ones that Communism was supposed to  &quot;liberate&quot;.  And after introducing the viewer to these people,  letting us get to know them in wonderfully acted vignettes, the Communists  come and we are forced to see it all destroyed.  The shift is slowly built  up to but is, none the less, intensley harrowing and ghastly when it  finally comes.  To the American viewer, it is analogus to suddenly seeing  the Brady Bunch brutally murdered.  Mikhalkov incisivley demonstrates,  not only the physical savagery of Marxism which was considerable, but he  also explores, it's intensivley antihuman methods that aimed not only to  destroy the mind but the soul as well.  The film is long.  The film is  subtle.  The film can try the patience with its disorienting pace.  It  helps greatly to know some Russian history. The script could have explained  more. But, ultimately, during the last half hour, the film is wrenching.  How could anyone support an idealogy that would casually ruin and corrupt  people such as these?  Murder, torture, suicide; the Marxist utopia.  Why  is it necessary for the Russians themselves to make films exposing the  Communist horror?  Why cannot Hollywood?  What is the flaw that allows  American film to excuse genocide?  Burnt By The Sun.  Powerful.  Disturbing. And depressing. It is an accusation. It should be seen.  The  viewer might also wish to try another harrowing film about Communist Russia  called THE CHEKIST.

The result would be something like &#8220;Burnt by the Sun&#8221; (&#8220;Utomlennye solntsem&#8221;) a poignant story of people living quietly in the peaceful countryside in the 1936 Soviet Union.The story of &#8220;Burnt by the Sun&#8221; unfolds like that of a stage play, taking place in one day. We are introduced to a Russian revolution hero Colonel Sergei Petrovich Kotov (Nikita Mikhalkov), his wife Maroussia (Ingeborga Dapk&#363;nait&#279;) and daughter Nadia (director&#8217;s daughter Nadezhda Mikhalkova). To Sergei&#8217;s happy family living in an idyllic countryside comes &#8220;Uncle Mitya&#8221; (Oleg Menshikov), who has suddenly disappeared more than ten years ago.Mikhalkov&#8217;s Oscar-winning drama slowly reveals why Mitya had to leave the village years ago, and why he has come back. Told in an understated way, &#8220;Burnt by the Sun&#8221; often looks more like a tragi-comedy. The beautifully-shot film has romances, mysteries to be solved and sly humor that is sprinkled throughout the story.The best thing of the film would be the little girl Nadir, who is always adorable, representing pure innocence. The film is overlong (Chekhov would have ended it fifteen minutes earlier), but it is still powerful and emotional.",4,"Burnt by the Sun: Romance, Intrigue and Innocence",1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,1349,"['What', 'great', 'Russian', 'writer', 'Chekhov', 'had', 'written', 'story', 'play', 'time', 'Stalin', 'result', 'would', 'be', 'something', '8220', 'Burnt', 'Sun', '8221', '8220', 'Utomlennye', 'solntsem', '8221', 'poignant', 'story', 'people', 'living', 'quietly', 'peaceful', 'countryside', '1936', 'Soviet', 'Union.The', 'story', '8220', 'Burnt', 'Sun', '8221', 'unfolds', 'stage', 'play', 'taking', 'place', 'one', 'day', 'are', 'introduced', 'Russian', 'revolution', 'hero', 'Colonel', 'Sergei', 'Petrovich', 'Kotov', 'Nikita', 'Mikhalkov', 'wife', 'Maroussia', 'Ingeborga', 'Dapk', '363', '279', 'daughter', 'Nadia', 'director', '8217', 'daughter', 'Nadezhda', 'Mikhalkova', 'Sergei', '8217', 'happy', 'family', 'living', 'idyllic', 'countryside', '8220', 'Uncle', 'Mitya', '8221', 'Oleg', 'Menshikov', 'who', 'suddenly', 'disappeared', 'more', 'ten', 'years', 'ago.Mikhalkov', '8217', 'Oscar-winning', 'drama', 'slowly', 'reveals', 'why', 'Mitya', 'had', 'leave', 'village', 'years', 'ago', 'why', 'come', 'back', 'Told', 'understated', 'way', '8220', 'Burnt', 'Sun', '8221', 'often', 'more', 'tragi-comedy', 'beautifully-shot', 'film', 'romances', 'mysteries', 'be', 'solved', 'sly', 'humor', 'sprinkled', 'story.The', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'girl', 'Nadir', 'who', 'always', 'adorable', 'representing', 'pure', 'innocence', 'film', 'overlong', 'Chekhov', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'earlier', 'still', 'powerful', 'emotional']",Burnt By the Sun VHS

A former Russian &quot;war hero&quot; on his &quot;dacha&quot; (country house) with his family and friends. Another friend shows up... to arrest him as the &quot;enemy of the Russian people&quot; (Vrag Naroda).  In one hand this film will show the brutality and crazyness of this time in USSR history. In another hand? Very good actors with a VERY bad and fake acting. Grotesque is way OVER done, what made this film looks like a mediocre student movie.This film was made at the time when movie studios in Russia had to produce money making films. This period in Russian cinema history should be called as &quot;The Russian Cinema Big Depression&quot;. And this film came as best example of it. It did win few awards and made good money, but Nikita Michalkov should be ashamed for making this one.
