1110930,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B000WOQKL2,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[1, 2]","This Bollywood epic weighs in at the length of ""Gone With the Wind"" but the story of the ""Mighty Ducks."" Years after facing humiliating defeat on the field, former hockey star Kabir Khan (Shahrukh Khan) returns to the game as coach of the Indian women's national hockey team, striving to shape a ragtag bunch of female athletes into a playing force to be reckoned with. His 16 recruits show up from every corner of India, a testiment to the ethnic diversity of that massive land. For the most part, they represent types rather than characters -- the spoiled rich girl, the tomboy, the shy one, the angry one etc etc. Khan's job is to meld them into a team, for as he observes, it's teamwork, not strength that wins world championships.What elevates this a little over the usual biopic is the Indian setting. Khan is a Muslim -- he's denounced as a traitor to India after missing a vital shot in a match against Pakistan. But his heart still beats true and strong for the beloved homeland. There is an interesting feminist twist -- the women have to take on the Indian male team to persuade the sexists who run the hockey association to spend the money on them to go to the world championship. In one amusing scene, the women beat up a bunch of boorish men who are harrassing them at a fast-food restaurant.Just about every scene of this movie is predictable as is the dialogue and the characters. But it still made for a fairly harmless and painless evening's entertainment.",3,"Cliched, overlong but still entertaining",1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,1474,"['Bollywood', 'epic', 'length', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'story', 'Mighty', 'Ducks', 'Years', 'facing', 'humiliating', 'defeat', 'field', 'former', 'hockey', 'star', 'Kabir', 'Khan', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'game', 'coach', 'Indian', 'women', 'national', 'hockey', 'team', 'striving', 'shape', 'ragtag', 'bunch', 'female', 'athletes', 'playing', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', '16', 'recruits', 'show', 'up', 'corner', 'India', 'testiment', 'ethnic', 'diversity', 'massive', 'land', 'most', 'part', 'represent', 'types', 'rather', 'characters', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'girl', 'tomboy', 'shy', 'one', 'angry', 'one', 'etc', 'etc', 'Khan', 'job', 'meld', 'team', 'teamwork', 'not', 'strength', 'world', 'championships.What', 'little', 'usual', 'biopic', 'Indian', 'setting', 'Khan', 'Muslim', 'denounced', 'traitor', 'India', 'missing', 'vital', 'shot', 'match', 'Pakistan', 'heart', 'still', 'true', 'strong', 'beloved', 'homeland', 'interesting', 'feminist', 'twist', 'women', 'have', 'take', 'Indian', 'male', 'team', 'persuade', 'sexists', 'who', 'run', 'hockey', 'association', 'spend', 'money', 'go', 'world', 'championship', 'one', 'amusing', 'scene', 'women', 'beat', 'up', 'bunch', 'boorish', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'harrassing', 'fast-food', 'restaurant.Just', 'scene', 'movie', 'predictable', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'still', 'made', 'fairly', 'harmless', 'painless', 'evening', 'entertainment']",Chakde!

Can they play together as a team for India or will they play with the attitude that each thinks themselves the best?  Through insults and disagreements from the girls, then his decision to resign, Kabir Khan uses situations and wisdom in making difficult decisions.  He is tough with the girls because he knows how it feels to lose a World Championship game having come so close to winning, and the degradation and burden of that loss.  No one lets you forget!  So he constantly advocates playing as a team because it is the only way to play for India and win the World Championship.  He succeeds in getting them to the World Championship games after the decision to play against a men's hockey team became the deciding factor.  The men, a professional team, were impressed with their determination to make it through and that helped turn the decision in the girls favour.  Having come this far, will Kabir Khan succeed in coaching his team to play for India and therefore win the World Championship games for their country, especially after the initial  game of 0 goals for India, and 7 goals for Australia?

1110939,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000WOQKL2,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[12, 12]","Did you know that, once upon a time, India was a perennial world power in the sport of field hockey? That, from 1928 to 1980, India garnered eight gold medals in the Olympics? So you'd think hockey would have a larger following. Instead, cricket reigns today as India's most popular national pastime, with field hockey skulking somewhere in the back. CHAK DE! INDIA, in its own little way, takes one tiny step to change that.CHAK DE! INDIA tells the inspiring fictional story of the India women's national hockey team, from the rocky formation of its newest crop of members to its triumphant quest for the World Cup. CHAK DE! INDIA also tells the story of one man's redemption. As the film opens, the Women's Hockey World Cup is three months away, and yet India's team still doesn't have a coach. Not too surprising, as it's a team disparaged by most, even by the Indian hockey's governing body, of which one member scornfully states that Indian women are born to cook and clean. Finally, in steps Kabir Khan, a disgraced former player of the India Men's National Hockey Team who, seven years ago, was accused of throwing a championship game to Pakistan. But now Kabir has come out of seclusion to become the India women's new coach. And he's got something to prove. Hell, the whole team has got something to prove. But, first, Kabir Khan has to turn this combative, mismatched, agenda-steeped bunch into a cohesive unit...In CHAK DE! INDIA (""Go, India!""or, maybe, ""C'mon, India!""), Indian cinema refreshingly does away with its habitually overwrought melodrama and giddy romances. What we get is a simple story, told with impact and with restraint. It's one of the most entertaining and highest grossing Bollywood films of 2007. And why not? CHAK DE! INDIA is a superb underdog sports movie that'll strike a chord. The training sequences and the hockey matches are played out convincingly enough (at least, I didn't feel that the girls were faking it). Although several of the cast are actual hockey players (the actresses who played Komal, Nethra, and Raynia), all the girls attended a few months of rigorous hockey bootcamp. Too, while there are songs here (usually played over a training or game time montage), there aren't any extravagant song and dance numbers. For this movie, that's a good thing.The cast of mostly unknowns makes it work. The story is peopled with the requisite bunch of misfits and outcasts, hailing from all parts of India (with some parts being decidedly provincial and backwatered). While it's noted that several of the girls are very easy on the eyes, the majority of the women's team aren't from the glam community. This, along with a certain rawness and a spirit in the performances, lends a more realistic feel to the film. Particular standouts are Chitrashi Rawat as the diminutive but oh-so-feisty Komal, Tanya Abrol as the hotheaded Balbir, Shilpa Shukla as the most experienced but very disruptive Bindia, Vidya Malvade as the quiet, newly married goalie and team captain Vidya, and Sagarika Ghage as the beautiful but selfish Preeti, determined to score the most goals (she has something to prove to her famous cricket-playing boyfriend, you see). Chitrashi and Sagarika have two of the strongest story arcs as they play two prolific scorers who refuse to pass to each other.Shahrukh Khan can really act! Here, he veers away from his patented romantic roles, and really shows what he can do without the crutch of having a Rani or a Preity or a Kajol as love interests. Here, as the tough-minded coach, Shahrukh is tremendous, his acting very much controlled (we all know sometimes he goes overboard with the histrionics). While the girls are very winning, it's Shahrukh who holds everything together. But Shahrukh is generous enough that, in his scenes with them, he allows the girls to shine. Oh, and he develops an interesting scruff on his face.The story isn't subtle or twisty. CHAK DE! INDIA, steeped in its underdog sports genre, unveils plot devices you see coming from a mile away. And yet it rises above its predictability by virtue of the cast's appeal and the film's understated tone and warmth. It also touches on issues topical to India: regionalism, sexism, religion (Hinduism vs. Islam), dirty sports politics, and hockey languishing in the shadow of cricket. Above all, it touches on the universal themes of patriotism and gender inequality. Yet the patriotism isn't overbearing, and you pull for these girls all the way as they make their mark on their sport.Here's a long paragraph about the film's Special Features. Disc One has the film and the song selections. Disc Two is jam-full of bonus stuff: ""The Making Of"" feature (22 minutes long, but not enough focus on the female cast); 2 rousing music videos: ""Ek Hockey Doongi Rakhke"" and ""Kuch Kariye""; the making of the ""Ek Hockey Doongi Rakhke"" music video; a whopping 34 minutes of deleted scenes (including the girls celebrating to ""Dhoom Machale"" after the Men's Match, the girls playing the musical game Antakshari, and the India vs. Germany semi-finals match) - these extra sequences actually do flesh out the characters even more; the cast is featured and the film's impact is discussed in a talk show; ""Cult of CHAK DE: NDTV"" - hang out with three of the actresses (Vidya Malvade, Chitrashi Rawat & Shilpa Shukla )and three members of the India women's hockey team who won the gold medal in the 2002 Commonwealth Games, as they all talk about the film; SRK shares his experience of screening the film with India's President Mrs. Pratibha Patil; the film's UK premiere at the Somerset House; a photo gallery and character bios; and the trailer & film promos. Overall, very worthwhile bonus stuff.Something now from the When Movies and Real Life Collide department: CHAK DE! INDIA is loosely based on the real life India Women's hockey team who won the gold medal in the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games. Also, Kabir Khan's story bears a striking similarity to Mir Ranjan Negi's real life experiences. Negi, the goalkeeper in the India national hockey team, gave up 7 goals to Pakistan in the 1982 Asian Games and was widely blamed for the loss, even being hailed as a traitor. Negi would partly redeem himself by coaching the Indian team that won the Gold Medal in the 1998 Asian Games and, later, by coaching the India women's national hockey team that struck gold in the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Negi was hired on to this film to train the cast in playing field hockey.One doesn't walk away from this film as suddenly intimate with the intricacies of field hockey, yet CHAK DE! INDIA breaks down the game enough that you do get the gist of the sport and appreciate what the girls are going thru. I thought this film was tremendous. CHAK DE! INDIA is right up there withLagaan - Once Upon a Time in IndiaandIqbal, in the realm of excellent sports films put out by Bollywood. Again, CHAK DE! INDIA is an example of what Bollywood is capable of when it eschews the dumbed-down humor, the exaggerated hanky-wringing, and the singing and dancing (although, don't get it twisted, I mostly dig the song and dance routines). Sometimes, a dose of grit and reality, of heart without sopping sentimentality, is what's called for. And CHAK DE! INDIA fits that bill. The commercial and critical success can't be a fluke, right? Just listen to that rallying cry: Chak de!",5,"""I am told that from the 250 million girls in this country you are the 16 best hockey players.""",1210377600,"05 10, 2008",2008,7376,"['Did', 'know',

He returns seven years later to coach the India women's field hockey team and take them to the World Cup.One of the interesting themes to me from the story was just how fractured India is.  The coach struggles with the team players seeing themselves as state champions. They value their state first and then India.  They don't work well together.

I just want to add that this is a more realistic and thoughtful movie that is more about uniting the regional differences of India into a cohesiveness as a national identity.I'm not a sports lover yet I found the hockey quite watchable. It isn't so much a sports movie but rather a story about personalities and nation.SRK is restrained but excellent. He is not really the main focus of the movie though as he steps back and allows the girls centre stage. Given that they are mostly unknowns and not even actors mostly the girls did a great job.A world match is played out in Melbourne (where I am from) and I must say they made the place look good - made me want to visit it!While there is background music, this isn't a song and dance Bollywood - no dances and one sporting song.I benefited in my understanding of India from watching it and it is a movie they can be justly proud of.",5,Interesting but not your song & dance type Bollywood,1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,939,"['other', 'reviews', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'cover', 'just', 'want', 'add', 'more', 'realistic', 'thoughtful', 'movie', 'more', 'uniting', 'regional', 'differences', 'India', 'cohesiveness', 'national', 'identity.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sports', 'lover', 'yet', 'found', 'hockey', 'quite', 'watchable', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'sports', 'movie', 'rather', 'story', 'personalities', 'nation.SRK', 'restrained', 'excellent', 'not', 'really', 'main', 'focus', 'movie', 'back', 'girls', 'centre', 'stage', 'Given', 'are', 'mostly', 'unknowns', 'not', 'even', 'actors', 'mostly', 'girls', 'did', 'great', 'job.A', 'world', 'match', 'played', 'out', 'Melbourne', 'where', 'am', 'must', 'say', 'made', 'place', 'look', 'good', 'made', 'want', 'visit', 'background', 'music', ""n't"", 'song', 'dance', 'Bollywood', 'dances', 'one', 'sporting', 'song.I', 'benefited', 'understanding', 'India', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'justly', 'proud']",Chakde!

This could be among the best SRK performances and lacks all of the usual overacting that is his trademark.  The movie proves that Bollywood can make highly entertaining movies and can do without the usual song and dance numbers while carrying a valuable social message. This movie rates 5 stars just for being more inventive than all the other dull-as-dishwater films that Bollywood churns out (mostly). The next movie should be about the abysmal Indian cricket team.,5,Unique movie and theme - great movie with an inspiring message,1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,574,"['unique', 'movie', 'poor', 'state', 'India', 'sports', 'apathy', 'experienced', 'sportswomen', 'could', 'be', 'best', 'SRK', 'performances', 'usual', 'overacting', 'trademark', 'movie', 'Bollywood', 'can', 'make', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'movies', 'can', 'do', 'usual', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'carrying', 'valuable', 'social', 'message', 'movie', 'rates', '5', 'stars', 'just', 'being', 'more', 'inventive', 'other', 'dull-as-dishwater', 'films', 'Bollywood', 'out', 'mostly', 'next', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'abysmal', 'Indian', 'cricket', 'team']",Chakde!
