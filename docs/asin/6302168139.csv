298948,AHISEES0UP0NG,6302168139,Atlanta Guy,"[5, 5]","This is a really good film for people who appreciate subtlety and somewhat offbeat character development.  This will not impress people who tend to gravitate more towards action or overt drama.  Malkovich and MacDowell turn in understated, nicely done performances as the films antiheroes, and they accomplish the somewhat difficult task of making us feel for these self-involved characters.  All the other characters are played well and the different plots mesh nicely.The only complaint I have is with the DVD itself.  The audio was abysmal on my system, and I am not really the pickiest of audiophiles.  In fact, this is the only time that I've been disappointed in or even noticed a DVD's lack of sound quality.  My player has a special feature that brings dialogue to the center speaker, and for some reason it would not work with this DVD.  The dialogue was difficult to understand throughout, and I often had to adjust the volume and replay bits of scenes to figure out what had been said.  Also, there are zero special features on this DVD... no trailers, no commentary, nada.I would wait for a better transfer rather than buying this DVD version of the film.  It's definitely worth a rent, however, for those who can appreciate what it has to offer.",3,"Good Movie, Bad DVD",1053820800,"05 25, 2003",2003,1258,"['really', 'good', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'subtlety', 'somewhat', 'offbeat', 'character', 'development', 'will', 'not', 'impress', 'people', 'who', 'tend', 'gravitate', 'more', 'towards', 'action', 'overt', 'drama', 'Malkovich', 'MacDowell', 'turn', 'understated', 'nicely', 'done', 'performances', 'films', 'antiheroes', 'accomplish', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'task', 'making', 'feel', 'self-involved', 'characters', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'well', 'different', 'plots', 'mesh', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'DVD', 'audio', 'was', 'abysmal', 'system', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'pickiest', 'audiophiles', 'fact', 'only', 'time', ""'ve"", 'been', 'disappointed', 'even', 'noticed', 'DVD', 'lack', 'sound', 'quality', 'My', 'player', 'special', 'feature', 'dialogue', 'center', 'speaker', 'reason', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'DVD', 'dialogue', 'was', 'difficult', 'understand', 'often', 'had', 'adjust', 'volume', 'replay', 'bits', 'scenes', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'said', 'Also', 'are', 'zero', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'trailers', 'commentary', 'nada.I', 'would', 'wait', 'better', 'transfer', 'rather', 'buying', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'rent', 'however', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'what', 'offer']",N/A

Malkovich and Andie MacDowell play used-to-being-rich grifters, coasting through life on charm and credit, who are forced to re-evaluate their relationship after their last liquid asset (a tiny sculpture by Henry Moore) is stolen. Not actually that romantic, not really a comedy, but an amazing showcase for two veteran character actors playing at full strength.",5,A Fascinating Portrait of Selfish Glamour,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,473,"['have', ""n't"", 'exposed', 'film', 'do', 'so', 'immediately', 'funny', 'wrenching', 'oddly', 'transcendent', 'Malkovich', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'play', 'used-to-being-rich', 'grifters', 'coasting', 'life', 'charm', 'credit', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 're-evaluate', 'relationship', 'last', 'liquid', 'asset', 'tiny', 'sculpture', 'Henry', 'Moore', 'stolen', 'Not', 'actually', 'romantic', 'not', 'really', 'comedy', 'amazing', 'showcase', 'two', 'veteran', 'character', 'actors', 'playing', 'full', 'strength']",N/A
298951,A2T049UQONS0OY,6302168139,Larry VanDeSande,"[3, 3]","Here's a real clever little comedy about vacuous people and a stolen piece of art that turns into a morality tale.John Malkovich and Andi McDowell -- who both bare their backsides as well as their souls in this flick -- are a couple escaping something and living in London far beyond their means. As a way to resolve this they hatch a plan to swindle an art dealer with an expensive trinket that looks like a Hurst shifter from the 1970s.The little mystery about deceit, swindling and lost souls becomes much more than this when an attendant at the hotel where the pair live decides she is in love with the piece of art -- and takes it home. What follows is conundrum after conundrum for a half-dozen people, including all the principals, told in a very witty and funny style.Lolita Davidovitch steals scene after scene as the deaf mute that makes up rooms in the hotel and makes off with the object of beauty, which she says speaks to her. Everyone gets theirs in the end, as the small diversion of a movie concludes with its characters exiting with less than they arrived.This movie is good fun that delivers rewards to attentive viewers far bigger than its ideas.",3,Clever and somewhat satisfying,1114300800,"04 24, 2005",2005,1166,"['Here', 'real', 'clever', 'little', 'comedy', 'vacuous', 'people', 'stolen', 'piece', 'art', 'morality', 'tale.John', 'Malkovich', 'Andi', 'McDowell', 'who', 'bare', 'backsides', 'as', 'well', 'souls', 'flick', 'are', 'couple', 'escaping', 'something', 'living', 'London', 'far', 'means', 'way', 'resolve', 'hatch', 'plan', 'swindle', 'art', 'dealer', 'expensive', 'trinket', 'Hurst', 'shifter', '1970s.The', 'little', 'mystery', 'deceit', 'swindling', 'lost', 'souls', 'becomes', 'much', 'more', 'when', 'attendant', 'hotel', 'where', 'pair', 'live', 'decides', 'love', 'piece', 'art', 'home', 'What', 'conundrum', 'conundrum', 'half-dozen', 'people', 'including', 'principals', 'told', 'very', 'witty', 'funny', 'style.Lolita', 'Davidovitch', 'steals', 'scene', 'scene', 'deaf', 'mute', 'up', 'rooms', 'hotel', 'off', 'object', 'beauty', 'speaks', 'Everyone', 'end', 'small', 'diversion', 'movie', 'characters', 'exiting', 'less', 'arrived.This', 'movie', 'good', 'fun', 'rewards', 'attentive', 'viewers', 'far', 'bigger', 'ideas']",N/A
