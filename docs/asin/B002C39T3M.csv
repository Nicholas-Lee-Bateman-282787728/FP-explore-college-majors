I don't agree with the other reviewers on here stating that the two leads have no chemisty, I think they do. Woody Harrelson is out of place in the film, I hated his character even though he tries to make the most of a so-so script. There's nothing really wrong with this movie, but it's pretty slow and the beginning is kinda far-fetched. Aniston and Zahn are two of my favorite actors but Management had me wanting to ""check-out"" early.

Jennifer Anniston is a corporate saleswoman who enters his life one night as a guest and gets him excited that he follows her all over the country to make her fall in love with him. Woody Harrelson plays Django her lover and the obstacle in their inevitable love. Steve Zahn is believable as the dim witted but lovable clerk but his character is hackneyed. Jennifer Anniston and Woody Harrelson are wasted in this enterprise because their characters are so predictable and badly written.A complete waste of film stock and talent and not to mention my wasted money and time watching and writing this review. The only solace I can find after watching this movie is in the fact at least a few dozen people were employed while making this movie but then a lot of productivity time was lost while watching this movie as well.

Instead, it was a romance with very honest characters and an unusually realistic feel to it. I think this is the best role I've ever seen Jennifer Aniston play. Steve Zahn is someone I've liked but never saw him as a leading man.The words 'leading man' hardly describe him in this movie. He is one of the two main characters (Aniston is the other) and he draws the viewer into his world. At first, you wonder if you really want to be in that world. Then, by the end of the movie, you feel like he could be your best friend.I can't help but think of another movie, 'Being John Malkovich', that tries to bring the viewer into a world. Sure, that world is topsy-turvy but the point is: that movie doesn't succeed in doing that half as much as this movie does. And that movie was critically acclaimed. This movie has not gathered much notice but I predict it will gain a reputation and stay around for a long time.

If you did, you were right. He is a puppy with a real bad case of puppy love for Jennifer Aniston's character, Sue.Zahn plays Mike who is kind of a slacker slash loaner slash something else. He never really did grow up but we love him nonetheless.He works as a night-time manager at his parent's hotel called The Kingman Inn, in Kingman Arizona. His life is real blah, to say the least.Then along comes Sue. She's an uptight art saleswoman from back east. She's in town for two nights selling some hotel paintings and happens to be staying at The Kingman Inn.Mike is instantly smitten for her and she is almost repulsed by his unique awkwardness. I won't spoil for you how they meet and how funny it is, because if you haven't seen the trailers (like I hadn't) then it will be a nice little treat for you.I don't know whether to credit the actors or the writer/director (Stephen Belber) for this brilliant scene; they probably all deserve the credit. It was shot so well and has so much to it for the small amount of dialogue that's used.Eventually, Mike grows on Sue just a tad and she leaves to head back east. Mike thinks there was a way bigger connection than there actually was and acts on it. He takes all his money and buys a one way ticket across the country to go and surprise her at work.Sue is not pleased but does mildly see this as a sweet gesture and agrees to spend a little time with him. Once she discovers he only had enough cash for a one way ticket, she buys him a ticket back home and tells him it's just not going to work out between the two of them.He learns that she has quit her job and moved to Washington to help her ex-boyfriend, who is now her new boyfriend again, who would still technically be considered an old boyfriend, right? Anyway, to help him with his yogurt business.Mike realizes that he may lose her forever and sells everything he has and moves to Washington. Once there, he has no idea how to contact her or find her and is homeless and jobless.He meets Al, (James Hiroyuki Liao), who next to Mike was the funniest character in the movie. Al works in a Chinese-American restaurant that his parents run and offers Mike a job and a place to stay. Mike agrees and moves into their basement.Together, they set out on a quest to get Sue back for Mike. Al is the ultimate wing man and is hilarious. I'm sure we can expect to see this young actor in a lot more films.They eventually track Sue and her boyfriend down and plenty of funny shenanigans are had. Woody Harrelson plays the boyfriend who is often referred to as, 'an ex punk'. Needless to say, as always Woody adds a nice mix into the comedic elements of this film.But the film isn't just a comedy. It's filled with several dramatic and touching moments that really hit you in the gut. This isn't your typical romantic comedy by any means. There are no clich&eacute;s here and the movie isn't predictable.In addition to a lot of laughs, there are great performances from every actor on screen. One thing that makes it so great is how much you get out of short scenes. Fred Ward and Margo Martindale aren't in the film for very long at all, but you feel like you really get to know them because their performances as Mike's parents are so believable and enjoyable.I especially loved the scene between Mike and his father involving a necklace. It's such a simple scene and with other actors would have been a lot less.Aniston may make a lot of the same kinds of movies but she never is the same character in her films. Here she is uptight but caring and has a soft side that only Mike can seem to bring out in her.Zahn definitely has a bigger part in the movie. We follow him through the entire film and I think this is probably his best performance. There is a scene towards the end of the film where he really breaks down and we see that he's a lot more than just the funny guy. Steve Zahn can play both sides of the coin, being dramatic and hilarious every bit as good as Robin Williams.If you want to watch a romantic comedy that most of us can relate to, will surely bring a smile to your face and a tear to your cheek, then Management is that film.Stephen Bebler did a knock out job for this being his first major film. It was beautifully written, hysterical at times and heart-warming at others. More films of this genre should take a few notes from what he's done here.",5,Management Review,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,4719,"['MANAGEMENTSTARRING', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Margo', 'Martindale', 'James', 'Hiroyuki', 'Liao', 'Fred', 'WardWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Stephen', 'BelberDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Stephen', 'BelberRated', 'RGenre', 'Romantic', 'ComedyRelease', 'Date', '15', 'May', '2009If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'cover', 'Management', 'may', 'have', 'thought', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'bit', 'puppy', 'dog', 'did', 'were', 'right', 'puppy', 'real', 'bad', 'case', 'puppy', 'love', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'character', 'Sue.Zahn', 'Mike', 'who', 'kind', 'slacker', 'slash', 'loaner', 'slash', 'something', 'else', 'never', 'really', 'did', 'grow', 'up', 'love', 'nonetheless.He', 'night-time', 'manager', 'parent', 'hotel', 'called', 'Kingman', 'Inn', 'Kingman', 'Arizona', 'life', 'real', 'blah', 'say', 'least.Then', 'Sue', 'uptight', 'art', 'saleswoman', 'back', 'east', 'town', 'two', 'nights', 'selling', 'hotel', 'paintings', 'be', 'staying', 'Kingman', 'Inn.Mike', 'instantly', 'smitten', 'almost', 'repulsed', 'unique', 'awkwardness', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'how', 'meet', 'how', 'funny', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'trailers', 'had', ""n't"", 'then', 'will', 'be', 'nice', 'little', 'treat', 'you.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'credit', 'actors', 'writer/director', 'Stephen', 'Belber', 'brilliant', 'scene', 'probably', 'deserve', 'credit', 'was', 'shot', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'much', 'small', 'amount', 'dialogue', 'used.Eventually', 'Mike', 'Sue', 'just', 'tad', 'head', 'back', 'east', 'Mike', 'thinks', 'was', 'way', 'bigger', 'connection', 'actually', 'was', 'acts', 'money', 'one', 'way', 'ticket', 'country', 'go', 'surprise', 'work.Sue', 'not', 'pleased', 'mildly', 'see', 'sweet', 'gesture', 'spend', 'little', 'time', 'only', 'had', 'enough', 'cash', 'one', 'way', 'ticket', 'ticket', 'back', 'home', 'just', 'not', 'going', 'work', 'out', 'two', 'them.He', 'learns', 'quit', 'job', 'moved', 'Washington', 'help', 'ex-boyfriend', 'who', 'now', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'again', 'who', 'would', 'still', 'technically', 'be', 'considered', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'right', 'Anyway', 'help', 'yogurt', 'business.Mike', 'may', 'lose', 'forever', 'everything', 'moves', 'Washington', 'Once', 'there', 'idea', 'how', 'contact', 'find', 'homeless', 'jobless.He', 'meets', 'Al', 'James', 'Hiroyuki', 'Liao', 'who', 'Mike', 'was', 'funniest', 'character', 'movie', 'Al', 'Chinese-American', 'restaurant', 'parents', 'run', 'Mike', 'job', 'place', 'stay', 'Mike', 'moves', 'basement.Together', 'set', 'out', 'quest', 'get', 'Sue', 'back', 'Mike', 'Al', 'ultimate', 'wing', 'man', 'hilarious', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'expect', 'see', 'young', 'actor', 'lot', 'more', 'films.They', 'eventually', 'track', 'Sue', 'boyfriend', 'down', 'plenty', 'funny', 'shenanigans', 'are', 'had', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'often', 'referred', 'ex', 'punk', 'Needless', 'say', 'always', 'Woody', 'nice', 'mix', 'comedic', 'elements', 'film', ""n't"", 'just', 'comedy', 'filled', 'several', 'dramatic', 'touching', 'moments', 'really', 'hit', 'gut', ""n't"", 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'means', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'here', 'movie', ""n't"", 'predictable.In', 'addition', 'lot', 'laughs', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'actor', 'screen', 'One', 'thing', 'so', 'great', 'how', 'much', 'get', 'short', 'scenes', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'Margo', 'Martindale', 'are', ""n't"", 'film', 'very', 'long', 'feel', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'performances', 'Mike', 'parents', 'are', 'so', 'believable', 'enjoyable.I', 'especially', 'loved', 'scene', 'Mike', 'father', 'involving', 'necklace', 'such', 'simple', 'scene', 'other', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'less.Aniston', 'may', 'make', 'lot', 'same', 'kinds', 'movies', 'never', 'same', 'character', 'films', 'Here', 'uptight', 'caring', 'soft', 'side', 'only', 'Mike', 'can', 'seem', 'bring', 'out', 'her.Zahn', 'definitely', 'bigger', 'part', 'movie', 'follow', 'entire', 'film', 'think', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'really', 'breaks', 'down', 'see', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'funny', 'guy', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'can', 'play', 'sides', 'coin', 'being', 'dramatic', 'hilarious', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'Robin', 'Williams.If', 'want', 'watch', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'most', 'can', 'relate', 'will', 'surely', 'bring', 'smile', 'face', 'tear', 'cheek', 'then', 'Management', 'film.Stephen', 'Bebler', 'did', 'knock', 'out', 'job', 'being', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'was', 'beautifully', 'written', 'hysterical', 'times', 'heart-warming', 'others', 'More', 'films', 'genre', 'should', 'take', 'few', 'notes', 'what', 'done', 'here']",N/A

1261889,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B002C39T3M,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Sometimes movies are all about expectations. I expected this movie to be a mindless, silly, way over produced, over acted, overly made up, big city, corporate drama / comedy, like many Jennifer Aniston films. Well 5 minutes into the film that expectation flew completely out of the window. This is a very romantic, quirky, low budget film; that I liked a lot.The film opens with Steve Zahn, Mike, being a huge creep. Jennifer Aniston, Sue, arrives at the Motel owned by Mike's family. He notices her at the front desk checking in (and oh yes Jennifer Aniston looks wonderful) and decides to stalk her in a very creepy way. At first, a bit of Bates Hotel went through my mind. Within the first 15 minutes the stalking kind of ends and this unusual attraction starts to develop between the two. Mike is kind of a kooky odd guy, seems not too bright; and Sue is an extremely attractive, intelligent, seems very confident. In the end it's clear that both characters have a facade that quickly pulls away.The overall story is fairly simple, it is about Mike falling in love with Sue, and the big question; will Sue fall in love with Mike?There's some decent comedy along the way. Nothing gut splitting, just nice gentle humor. The film really bogs down badly at about an hour. The director had a very difficult time heading into the third act. About 10 minutes of the story should have been cut from the hour and 33 minute film. Jennifer Aniston seems to have left behind the Friends look, and actually has this lovely woman next door look. Steve Zahn is eventually likeable as an odd, kind person. There is some wonderful romance in this film. The ending is absolutely perfect, I actually cheered when the director stopped exactly where the film circles back around to a wonderful ending.This is a fairly low budget film. The camera work wasn't always perfect. There were moments when shots were out of focus. Some needless handheld camera movement jumped in here and there. Framing wasn't necessarily used effectively. But none of that seemed to matter much, because I believed the story and was more interested in what would happen. The soundtrack is very nice, some beautiful acoustic guitar that nicely supported the film.The supporting cast is excellent. Both mothers are perfect. Dad is stoic and strange, and kept to his role all the way up to the end. Al, the Chinese restaurant guy, is outstanding. I did not care much for Woody Harrelson. His acting was cardboard, lines delivered almost like he was reading them, and the character was not believable.The movie is rated R. There's a bit of strong language. There is no nudity. There is one scene where a couple is shown making pretty passionate love, but no private parts are ever shown. There's no violence. This film is probably fine for younger viewers and it's kind of hard for me to completely understand this rating.The DVD includes 17 minutes of deleted scenes. There's a couple of story line threads that were completely removed from the film, a porn star thing, two guys skip on their hotel bill, Mike learns how to play the piano, and a post coital scene in a park; that were so bad, they needed to stay out of the film. In some ways, I'm sorry I watched these deleted scenes (in fact, it's kind of hard for me to place where they would have gone in the film). There is a fairly nice gag reel, around 12 minutes. There is one scene I found pretty funny with Jennifer Aniston that totally caught me by surprise. There's the original theatrical trailer and the perfunctory director / actor commentary track.I liked this movie. I think it is a good movie, not great. It's a sweet, simple, love story. Nothing pretentious, nothing difficult. This was a fine start for a first time director. That I liked it this much, maybe I was expecting a totally different film and was pleasantly surprised.",4,Surprise,1255046400,"10 9, 2009",2009,3856,"['Sometimes', 'movies', 'are', 'expectations', 'expected', 'movie', 'be', 'mindless', 'silly', 'way', 'produced', 'acted', 'overly', 'made', 'up', 'big', 'city', 'corporate', 'drama', '/', 'comedy', 'many', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'films', 'Well', '5', 'minutes', 'film', 'expectation', 'flew', 'completely', 'window', 'very', 'romantic', 'quirky', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'liked', 'lot.The', 'film', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Mike', 'being', 'huge', 'creep', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Sue', 'Motel', 'owned', 'Mike', 'family', 'front', 'desk', 'checking', 'oh', 'yes', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'wonderful', 'stalk', 'very', 'creepy', 'way', 'first', 'bit', 'Bates', 'Hotel', 'went', 'mind', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'stalking', 'kind', 'ends', 'unusual', 'attraction', 'develop', 'two', 'Mike', 'kind', 'kooky', 'odd', 'guy', 'not', 'too', 'bright', 'Sue', 'extremely', 'attractive', 'intelligent', 'very', 'confident', 'end', 'clear', 'characters', 'have', 'facade', 'quickly', 'away.The', 'overall', 'story', 'fairly', 'simple', 'Mike', 'falling', 'love', 'Sue', 'big', 'question', 'will', 'Sue', 'fall', 'love', 'Mike', 'decent', 'comedy', 'way', 'Nothing', 'gut', 'splitting', 'just', 'nice', 'gentle', 'humor', 'film', 'really', 'bogs', 'down', 'badly', 'hour', 'director', 'had', 'very', 'difficult', 'time', 'heading', 'third', 'act', '10', 'minutes', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'hour', '33', 'minute', 'film', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'have', 'left', 'Friends', 'look', 'actually', 'lovely', 'woman', 'next', 'door', 'look', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'eventually', 'likeable', 'odd', 'kind', 'person', 'wonderful', 'romance', 'film', 'ending', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'actually', 'cheered', 'when', 'director', 'stopped', 'exactly', 'where', 'film', 'back', 'wonderful', 'ending.This', 'fairly', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'camera', 'work', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'perfect', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'shots', 'were', 'focus', 'needless', 'handheld', 'camera', 'movement', 'jumped', 'here', 'there', 'Framing', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'used', 'effectively', 'none', 'seemed', 'matter', 'much', 'believed', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'nice', 'beautiful', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'nicely', 'supported', 'film.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'mothers', 'are', 'perfect', 'Dad', 'stoic', 'strange', 'kept', 'role', 'way', 'end', 'Al', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'guy', 'outstanding', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'much', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'acting', 'was', 'cardboard', 'lines', 'delivered', 'almost', 'was', 'reading', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'believable.The', 'movie', 'rated', 'R.', 'bit', 'strong', 'language', 'nudity', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'couple', 'shown', 'making', 'pretty', 'passionate', 'love', 'private', 'parts', 'are', 'ever', 'shown', 'violence', 'film', 'probably', 'fine', 'younger', 'viewers', 'kind', 'hard', 'completely', 'understand', 'rating.The', 'DVD', '17', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'couple', 'story', 'line', 'threads', 'were', 'completely', 'removed', 'film', 'porn', 'star', 'thing', 'two', 'guys', 'skip', 'hotel', 'bill', 'Mike', 'how', 'play', 'piano', 'post', 'coital', 'scene', 'park', 'were', 'so', 'bad', 'needed', 'stay', 'film', 'ways', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'watched', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'fact', 'kind', 'hard', 'place', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'film', 'fairly', 'nice', 'gag', 'reel', '12', 'minutes', 'one', 'scene', 'found', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'totally', 'caught', 'surprise', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'perfunctory', 'director', '/', 'actor', 'commentary', 'track.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'sweet', 'simple', 'love', 'story', 'Nothing', 'pretentious', 'nothing', 'difficult', 'was', 'fine', 'start', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'liked', 'much', 'maybe', 'was', 'expecting', 'totally', 'different', 'film', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised']",N/A

Admittedly, I was a little worried about Steve Zahn's ability to hold his own alongside her, but he turned in a terrific performance.  It's not easy to play a sort of dumb character in a serious, natural, and completely honest manner, but Zahn does it.  There are laughs aplenty to be found here, but this is no dumb comedy - not by a long shot.Poor Mike (Zahn) is about as smooth with the ladies as I am.  When Sue Claussen (Aniston) checks in at the family-owned hotel where he works as the night manager and janitor, he is immediately smitten and uses the old ""complimentary wine"" ruse to try and get to know her.  A couple of uncomfortable yet very funny scenes ensue, and we learn that this beautiful woman who is way out of Mike's league is something of a lonely soul herself.  That being said, Sue has no thought of ever seeing Mike again - until he shows up at her workplace on the other side of the country a few days later.  In a seemingly foolhardy and somewhat spontaneous move, Mike has spent all of his money and left his family behind just to come and see her.  Sue is less than happy about this unexpected turn of events, but a part of her can't help but be touched by the puppy-dog devotion she has inspired in this strange young man.  After returning home, an undeterred Mike sends her letters and poems before chasing after her once again when she moves to the state of Washington to reunite with her old boyfriend (Woody Harrelson).  Mike proves himself quite willing to do anything, no matter how crazy, to see her again.  Anybody else would come across as a stalker, but Mike is far too genuine and sincere in his unabashed love for this woman to be considered anything of the sort.  And no matter what happens, even when all hope is seemingly lost, he still loves Sue in a most beautiful way.The story is really all about learning to manage your own life.  Even when she seemingly has all she thinks she wants and needs, it is really Sue who is screwed up the most.  Mike is obviously a dreamer and an eternal optimist, while Sue tries to find happiness in going about her life in a totally pragmatic fashion.  Both ultimately learn that sometimes you have to let go of everything in order to find what you have been trying to attain all along.  I loved this sweet and quirky romantic comedy.  I feel sure that most people will be able to identify themselves with one of the two main characters and maybe even learn something about themselves by enjoying the comedy foibles that make up this most unconventional of romances.",5,A delightful and refreshingly earnest romantic comedy,1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,2716,"['character', 'Management', ""n't"", 'one', 'sweeter', 'more', 'personable', 'characters', 'played', 'really', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'movie', 'Admittedly', 'was', 'little', 'worried', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'ability', 'hold', 'own', 'alongside', 'turned', 'terrific', 'performance', 'not', 'easy', 'play', 'sort', 'dumb', 'character', 'serious', 'natural', 'completely', 'honest', 'manner', 'Zahn', 'are', 'laughs', 'aplenty', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'dumb', 'comedy', 'not', 'long', 'shot.Poor', 'Mike', 'Zahn', 'smooth', 'ladies', 'am', 'When', 'Sue', 'Claussen', 'Aniston', 'checks', 'family-owned', 'hotel', 'where', 'night', 'manager', 'janitor', 'immediately', 'smitten', 'old', 'complimentary', 'wine', 'ruse', 'try', 'get', 'know', 'couple', 'uncomfortable', 'yet', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'ensue', 'learn', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'way', 'Mike', 'league', 'something', 'lonely', 'soul', 'being', 'said', 'Sue', 'thought', 'ever', 'seeing', 'Mike', 'again', 'up', 'workplace', 'other', 'side', 'country', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'seemingly', 'foolhardy', 'somewhat', 'spontaneous', 'move', 'Mike', 'spent', 'money', 'left', 'family', 'behind', 'just', 'come', 'see', 'Sue', 'less', 'happy', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'events', 'part', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'touched', 'puppy-dog', 'devotion', 'inspired', 'strange', 'young', 'man', 'returning', 'home', 'undeterred', 'Mike', 'letters', 'poems', 'chasing', 'once', 'again', 'when', 'state', 'Washington', 'reunite', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Mike', 'quite', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'matter', 'how', 'crazy', 'see', 'again', 'Anybody', 'else', 'would', 'come', 'stalker', 'Mike', 'far', 'too', 'genuine', 'sincere', 'unabashed', 'love', 'woman', 'be', 'considered', 'anything', 'sort', 'matter', 'what', 'even', 'when', 'hope', 'seemingly', 'lost', 'still', 'Sue', 'most', 'beautiful', 'way.The', 'story', 'really', 'learning', 'manage', 'own', 'life', 'Even', 'when', 'seemingly', 'really', 'Sue', 'who', 'screwed', 'up', 'most', 'Mike', 'obviously', 'dreamer', 'eternal', 'optimist', 'Sue', 'find', 'happiness', 'going', 'life', 'totally', 'pragmatic', 'fashion', 'ultimately', 'learn', 'sometimes', 'have', 'let', 'go', 'everything', 'order', 'find', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'attain', 'loved', 'sweet', 'quirky', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'feel', 'sure', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'one', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'maybe', 'even', 'learn', 'something', 'enjoying', 'comedy', 'make', 'up', 'most', 'unconventional', 'romances']",N/A

I don't mind a serious romance film, but just felt like this movie didn't really hit the spot. Too many times, the plot became utterly unrealistic and farcical. First of all, a corporate saleswoman falls in love with a semi-retarded motel clerk? Would that ever happen in real life? Furthermore, would anybody as good looking as Jennifer Aniston fall for somebody who looks like Steve Zahn? Jennifer Aniston's real job is to run a soup kitchen? It just seems to cute and good to be true. I hate to be cynical, but in order for a love story to work the audience has to believe.The second half gets a bit better, with Woody Harrelson and James Liao. Liao in particular is hilarious, playing off stereotypes of Asians. Harrelson and Liao bring the humor and spunk missing in the first half. However, it still seems like there's too much missing, as if too many ideas and relationships were packed into 90 minutes - too many loose threads. Steve Zahn becoming a Buddhist monk? It could be funny, but it's never quite as funny as it should be. Even my wife, who normally likes these types of movies, got up and left.

One night a traveling saleswoman, Sue (Jennifer Aniston), stops by for a night's stay while she attends meetings in Arizona, and Mike is immediately smitten. Originally creeped out by Mike's advances, Sue decides to throw him a bone before she leaves to go back to Maryland. Mike can't get enough of Sue, and proceeds to buy a one way ticket to visit her in Maryland.In 2009 we saw the wrong way to make a romantic stalker comedy with All About Steve, but before that playwright and screenwriter Stephen Belber offered up Management. Having worked as a writer in residence at Juliard as well as having received commissions from Manhattan Theater Club, Playwrights Horizons, the Hungtington Theater, Arena Stage, and Philadelphia Theater Company he seemed like the perfect choice to write and helm this type of semi-romantic comedy. Add to that the charm of Steve Zahn and Jennifer Aniston and it would seem that you would have a sure-fire hit.Unfortunately, you'd be wrong. Not to say that the movie's bad, but it unfortunately bombed at the box office. To be honest, the quirkiness of this movie isn't for everyone, but the natural charm of Steve Zahn makes his slight bit of creepiness palpable. But Stephen Belber fleshes out his characters making their actions more understandable at times when you'd typically be asking, ""What's going on here?"" And while you might still find yourself saying that at times in the movie, but as you move further through the narrative you find more of the motivation for their actions.The acting is pretty good, which has a lot to do with the likability of the actors. Steve Zahn hits the right note between creepy and sincere/naivete. Jennifer Aniston is better than I typically think she is as Mike's love interest, a girl with a bit of a complex for always helping people. The movie is stolen by a cameo in the second act by Woody Harrelson as Sue's on again off again boyfriend and ex-punk Jango. As always I'm amazed at how well a hippy can play a badass!As always though, Management is an indie movie that falls into that trap of most indie movies: quirkiness for the sake of being quirky. While Steve Zahn plays his role very well and makes him believable, the writing doesn't do much for the character making him simply too nave and too much of a simpleton. Also, at first, you can't really read Aniston's character at the beginning of the movie, and her choice to sleep with Mike seems off-putting and can turn off viewers early on.I did enjoy this movie, but I do really think that it's not really for everyone.

Although he is far from smooth, she slowly becomes charmed by his innocence and falls for him.  The movie documents their inability to really be together since they are separated by geography, class, etc.  There are few, IF ANY, comedic moments in the entire film.  It drags slowly through the plot and really just depicts the quirky-ness of two individuals with different lives.This film tries to be artsy, but isn't.

The more ""regular girl"" she plays the more attractive and charming I find her.  The more glamourous she tries to be, the more it feels fake.  She should be doing the kind of roles that Sandra Bullock was doing 10 years ago, now that Sandra Bullock has proved that she can play a slickly beautiful woman in The Proposal.Steve Zahn plays an earnest but obviously immature character with subltly and surprising grace.  The movie is billed as a romantic comedy, and it does follow a lot of the familiar rom-com beats(complete with zany supporting characters), but it's really a story about growing up.  Zahn has to get out of the comfortable lifestyle, and he's rather forced out of it by circumstance, and Aniston's character pulls, or entices, him to move beyond his comfort zone.There's an undercurrent of dreams and happiness deferred here, that's never really mentioned, but is clear in several of Aniston's loveliest scenes.  In one beautiful scene she sits up at night and contemplates essentially settling for Steve Zahn.  The movie never says it, never even really gets close, but it has a lot of interesting themes of putting aside the grand romance, putting aside the things that you keep chasing after so futilely and taking what's there, taking the happiness that you have.",5,Jennifer Aniston's attractiveness is inversely proportional to the glamour factor of her roles,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,1389,"['3', 'best', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'are', 'Office', 'Space', 'Good', 'Girl', 'now', 'Management', 'more', 'regular', 'girl', 'more', 'attractive', 'charming', 'find', 'more', 'glamourous', 'be', 'more', 'fake', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'kind', 'roles', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'was', 'doing', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'proved', 'can', 'play', 'slickly', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Proposal.Steve', 'Zahn', 'earnest', 'obviously', 'immature', 'character', 'subltly', 'surprising', 'grace', 'movie', 'billed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'follow', 'lot', 'familiar', 'rom-com', 'beats', 'complete', 'zany', 'supporting', 'characters', 'really', 'story', 'growing', 'up', 'Zahn', 'get', 'comfortable', 'lifestyle', 'rather', 'forced', 'circumstance', 'Aniston', 'character', 'pulls', 'entices', 'move', 'comfort', 'undercurrent', 'dreams', 'happiness', 'deferred', 'here', 'never', 'really', 'mentioned', 'clear', 'several', 'Aniston', 'loveliest', 'scenes', 'one', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'up', 'night', 'essentially', 'settling', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'movie', 'never', 'never', 'even', 'really', 'close', 'lot', 'interesting', 'themes', 'putting', 'grand', 'romance', 'putting', 'aside', 'things', 'keep', 'chasing', 'so', 'futilely', 'taking', 'what', 'there', 'taking', 'happiness', 'have']",N/A

Yeah right!It's a hard sell at the best of times, but ""Management"" just about pulls it off - and it does so because of excellent writing and the stunning acting capabilities of its two principal leads.STEVE ZAHN plays the hapless, but sweetly nave Mike Cranshaw who is living and working with his parents in their small motel ""The Kingman Motor Inn"" in the town of Kingman in Arizona (off Route 66). Mike's Mum Trish is effectively running the solid but uninspiring joint (a beautifully understated performance by MARGO MARTINDALE), while her says-little and does-even-less husband Jerry (FRED WARD at his effective best) seems stuck in a rut he doesn't know how to get out of.Life at the Motel is routine and boring - especially for the friendless and womanless Mike. But just occasionally - he gets up enough courage to bring a bottle of plonk around to a lady guest in her chalet and try on his `complimentary' wine routine. It never works. But this time - Mike's heart gets more than it bargained for when it encounters the big-city, tight-suited Jennifer Aniston character Susan Claussen, who's in town from Baltimore to flog paintings to corporate clients. Planes to appointments, car rentals to accommodation and a laptop on the bedside, she is the very epitome of a young executive woman going places. Mike is the last person in the world Sue would consider dating, let alone spending a lifetime with...the idea is almost laughable to her. But of course she keeps coming back to his sweetness and he pursues her because he's besotted and simply doesn't understand 'no' - nor get the meaning of boundaries.Along the way Mike encounters Zen Buddhists, takes piano lessons, sleeps in a basement in a Chinese restaurant and jumps out of a plane. There's one particularly great scene where Sue figures if she lets Mike touch her perfectly formed posterior, he'll give up and she can get on with her presentation notes and get a night's sleep (title above). She leans over and presents the said rear for his delectation. With his hand placed on her right cheek, they talk about weather conditions in Maryland - it's both visually and lyrically - very, very funny.But what keeps you watching is the growing tenderness between the two. Mike may not be the smartest tool in the kit, but he is heartfelt and sincere - and in many ways despite her obvious intelligence and affluence, Sue isn't. She needs to learn that and he needs to grow up. Woody Harrelson also turns up in a great pantomime role as the ex-punk-rocker Jango who is now rich through dog handling. Later Mike's Mum Trish becomes gravely ill - thereby presenting the two men in her life with changes both may not want but need...and on it goes.Written and Directed by first-timer STEPHEN BELBER and produced by SIDNEY KEMMEL, the offbeat rom-com ""Management"" hit the US screens in May 2009 receiving excellent reviews. And on the strength of this September 2009 BLU RAY - it's easy to see why.I first spotted Steve Zahn in a wonderful film called ""Happy, Texas"" where he was paired up with Britain's Jeremy Northam as two escaped convicts trapped in a hick town which tames their thieving ways and changes both of them for the better. Zahn's been bubbling under for years, but in ""Management"" he really shines. A lesser actor might have overdone the inner nerd to go for hammy laughs - and in the real world his character's ludicrous naivety might even have been insufferable, but Zahn makes you ache for Mike's attempts at wooing Susan.Aniston is more capable now as an actress than she's ever been. Her character's disbelief and dismissive awkwardness at first is so believable - and as the movie progresses - her barriers very subtly start coming down - to a point where you really do believe she would look at Mike as a 'nice guy' - and as 'good for her' - and that's more important than all the material crap in-between. She is superb in the part.Although it feels like an Indie production, the BLU RAY image is beautiful throughout - really crisp - you are aware almost all of the time that this is high-def and not a soft DVD image.The extras are great fun too; a feature-length commentary by Stephen Belber and Steve Zahn, Gag Reels and Bloopers (very funny outtakes - mostly of the whole cast giggling and fluffing lines), several Deleted Scenes and a Trailer.""Management"" is not going to bolster up my gravity-bound man-titties or lessen the amount of hair growing out my nasal passages - but it has enriched my brain. At its core is a truly lovely premise - that love will out - and corny or not - that 'is' what many of us believe.""Management"" isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but you can't help but think that the world is a nicer place, because this sweet little ode to hope is in it.A nice little movie...",4,"""...You Can Touch My Butt...But Then You Gotta Go...""",1259193600,"11 26,

Behind his docile demeanor he's an earnest guy. He doesn't seem to question ""why"" about things so much as plunge heart-first into them. If that makes you think, ""oh no, one of those people"" -- remember this is Steve Zahn. He is likeable as the type of guy who wears his Buddhist robe with a zip-up hoodie. I don't know what it is that keeps him from being so sweet as to be saccharin...all I know is that he plays Mike perfectly.Mike meets Sue (Jennifer Aniston) a traveling saleswoman who sells art prints to motels. He brings wine to her(claiming it is a usual motel service) and awkwardly charms himself into her room. Sue is exasperated, but somehow intrigued. I think his vulnerability pulls her in.Mike has her number too. He notices that Sue takes care of everybody else, but never herself. He knows who she is beneath her cool exterior. Great combination and great chemisty between these two. They bring out the best in each other.

1261908,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B002C39T3M,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[0, 0]","This hit or miss tale follows Jennifer Aniston, a serious business woman staying at a motel, and Steven Zahn (who plays the son of the parental owners of said motel). Boy sees girl and falls madly in love with her, especially after they make an awkward connection with sex and the like which prompts boy to follow girl to her place of residence. Girl freaks but finds it somewhat sweet but then complications ensue and boy loses girl to girl's ex boyfriend. Girl says ex boyfriend can help her with her career and we also know that she's there for the money after we see the place.Throughout the whole tale it's made evident that boy needs to ""grow up"" in order to win the girl but the translation of him ""growing up"" seems to boil down to him acquiring assets. Or, you could read it as girl is only interested in a man with sizable assets. She ends up with her ex boyfriend (played by a punkish looking Woody Harreslon) and then things don't work out and boy eventually ""finds himself"" and goes out to see her with blind devotion becoming a charming stalker in the process (well, he was already like that actually). But girl doesn't seem to really think they have a chance until boy produces the deed to the motel that his parents gave him. Oh and she got to make all these mistakes at boy's expense and is even pregnant yet boy gives her this blind devotion even though it's going to be a ton of baggage that wasn't his fault. Niiiiice.I would have been more pleased if they just put two lovers together who had a connection on many different levels. Putting two people together and making it evident that the girl would not consider the boy unless he had assets made me feel I was watching something from the Middle Ages. Okay, maybe just the Renaissance. Heh.What's the point of showing two lovers who are supposed to have this awesome connection and then we conclude she will only consider him for his property? I could throw a rock and hit a bunch of people who fall into that category. How despairingly mundane.There are some good moments in the film but that overall message pretty much drops the overall quality of the picture.The budget for this picture is not listed (should I be worried?) but it earned only about 2.6M at the Box Office and a bit over $3.8M in DVD sales.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; LOVE TALE/FOCUSES: C minus; WHEN WATCHED: early September 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus.",2,MY GRADE: C plus to B minus,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,2448,"['hit', 'miss', 'tale', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'serious', 'business', 'woman', 'staying', 'motel', 'Steven', 'Zahn', 'who', 'son', 'parental', 'owners', 'said', 'motel', 'Boy', 'girl', 'madly', 'love', 'especially', 'make', 'awkward', 'connection', 'sex', 'like', 'prompts', 'boy', 'follow', 'girl', 'place', 'residence', 'Girl', 'freaks', 'somewhat', 'then', 'complications', 'ensue', 'boy', 'loses', 'girl', 'girl', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'Girl', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'can', 'help', 'career', 'also', 'know', 'there', 'money', 'see', 'place.Throughout', 'whole', 'tale', 'made', 'evident', 'boy', 'grow', 'up', 'order', 'win', 'girl', 'translation', 'growing', 'up', 'boil', 'down', 'acquiring', 'assets', 'could', 'read', 'girl', 'only', 'interested', 'man', 'sizable', 'assets', 'up', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'punkish', 'looking', 'Woody', 'Harreslon', 'then', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'boy', 'eventually', 'out', 'see', 'blind', 'devotion', 'becoming', 'charming', 'stalker', 'process', 'well', 'was', 'already', 'actually', 'girl', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'think', 'have', 'chance', 'boy', 'deed', 'motel', 'parents', 'gave', 'Oh', 'got', 'make', 'mistakes', 'boy', 'expense', 'even', 'pregnant', 'yet', 'boy', 'blind', 'devotion', 'even', 'going', 'be', 'ton', 'baggage', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'Niiiiice.I', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'pleased', 'just', 'put', 'two', 'lovers', 'together', 'who', 'had', 'connection', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'Putting', 'two', 'people', 'together', 'making', 'evident', 'girl', 'would', 'not', 'consider', 'boy', 'had', 'assets', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'watching', 'something', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'Okay', 'maybe', 'just', 'Renaissance', 'Heh.What', 'point', 'showing', 'two', 'lovers', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'have', 'awesome', 'connection', 'then', 'conclude', 'will', 'only', 'consider', 'property', 'could', 'throw', 'rock', 'hit', 'bunch', 'people', 'who', 'fall', 'category', 'How', 'despairingly', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'film', 'overall', 'message', 'pretty', 'much', 'overall', 'quality', 'picture.The', 'budget', 'picture', 'not', 'listed', 'should', 'be', 'worried', 'earned', 'only', 'about', '2.6M', 'Box', 'Office', 'bit', '3.8M', 'DVD', 'sales.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING', 'B', 'minus', 'CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE', 'B', 'minus', 'B', 'LOVE', 'TALE/FOCUSES', 'C', 'minus', 'WHEN', 'WATCHED', 'early', 'September', '2012', 'OVERALL', 'GRADE', 'C', 'B', 'minus']",N/A

Steve Zahn's character really is something like a stalker and it is kind of hard to imagine someone like him not scaring someone like Jennifer Aniston's character to death.

Whether you like or dislike this will depend on how easily you buy into the entire concept.Also, we live in a period in which romantic comedies -- which is actually my favorite genre -- are suffering from steep decline.  So, while this would not by any stretch of the imagination qualify as a great film, it is, compared to other options at the moment, not at all bad.Another way in which the film managed to rise above many others of the same time is the photography.  Almost every shot is more interesting than you would expect in a film like this.  There are a host of interesting shots and camera angles and it really does rise higher than the typical film.Also, got to love any movie that includes several New Pornographers songs.

Yarbrough""","[2, 4]","Steve Zahn and Jennifer Aniston are indeed an awkward couple, which is why I think they work so perfectly together in this awkward little romantic comedy.  Zahn plays Mike, the night manager at his parent's Arizona motel and Aniston is Sue, a traveling corporate art seller.  Mike is quirky and odd, he does yoga and brings Sue complimentary bottles of wine and champagne to try to hit on her when she stays in the motel on a business trip.  Sue is uptight and self absorbed; she's adamant about recycling and feeding the homeless. The two are complete opposites but when Sue gives in to Mike just a little, he refuses to give up till he gets the girl.This is not your typical cutesy romantic comedy.  There are odd silent moments between the two characters which definitely make it uncomfortable for the movie viewer, but it also makes the movie more real. There are so many people in the world who do get wrapped up in their boring lives and refuse to live a little, and this film might have them wishing that someone like Mike would come knocking on their motel room door and want to ""touch their butt"" and force them to bend and break and live a little.Mike takes chances to go after the girl even when Sue jumps on a plane to go home.  It's obvious when he buys a one way ticket to go see her, not just because he didn't have enough money to get back if things didn't work out. And even though she turns him away, he still refuses to give up no matter how odd or boring she turns out to be. It may seem he just isn't good enough for her, but when Mike returns to Arizona to say good-bye to his dying mom, he realizes he can't give up.  If you really want something, you've got to put down the cards that life deals you and go out there and get it. Even when Sue is ready to settle down and all her dreams come crashing down, Mike is still there for her. It's the classic tale of the boy waiting to get the girl, even after her Prince Charming is gone.Woody Harrelson and Margo Martindale make up an excellent supporting cast in this sweet little film.  See it for yourself and be the judge.  The humor is very real and doesn't seem forced at all which is why I think I appreciated it so much.

1261922,A3SRBACI3VJD9R,B002C39T3M,T. Johnson,"[4, 6]","Management is an odd flavor of romantic comedy mixed with a dash of something else. First you have Jennifer Aniston doing a nice job of quiet emoting - she has an inherent depth to her and a strong ability to appear somewhat lost and alone in a real and sympathetic way. Then you have Steve Zahn, who also has some depths to him, but he has a mixed role that's alternates between sweet love struck fool and someone stuck in a bad comedy, particularly the scenes without Jennifer Aniston around. She really anchors the movie, has funny chemistry with Zahn, and the plot wanders too far into dumb comedy at times when she's not on screen.Overall it's still a fairly enjoyable movie, but I think it would have been better if it stuck more with its two stars and their awkward/sweet/funny relationship instead of veering too far into the dumb comedy realm with Woody Harrelson and the other guy who played Steve's friend.Mildly recommended if you have nothing better to watch. It has some good moments, you just have to wade through some lesser comedy filler as well.

I'm not sure how anybody can watch this and decide it ranks as 5 stars.  If this doesn't strike you as over the top creepy when a guy working the night shift at a small hotel, then stalks and finds an attractive guest on the other side of the country, I'm not sure what to tell you... I do think you should probably talk to a counselor, or possibly the police.  It felt like Zahn's character should have had human body parts in his refrigerator or carving images of Charley Manson into his skin with a safety pin.  That Aniston's character allowed that creeper into her highly competitive and cold corporate life is COMPLETELY out of character.  I'm just amazed she read this script and decided it was a good call to be a part of this project.  I'm sure there were a lot of zeros behind whatever number was offered to her.  Or it was some sort of hostage negotiation deal worked out we will never know about.The script if terrible, the acting droll, the story horrendous, and the outcome shameful.  Don't see this movie.  Please don't see this movie.  As for buying it, I'm sure there are plenty of weirdos out there holding hope they can chase a 10 across the country, offer her nothing, and still come away with the girl in the end.
