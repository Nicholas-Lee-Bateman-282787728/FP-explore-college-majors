1279224,A3OAAHGGZIQKJ1,B002N5N4PS,Cookmeister,"[8, 12]","The continuing saga of Charlie, Alan, and Jake continues to generate a lot of laughs and funny situations.The season mostly revolves around Charlie's on again off again relationship with his fiancee Chelsea. First he is tempted by his previous fiancee Mia, and then Chelsea is tempted by a lawyer ""Who is everything that Charlie isn't"". There are also complications in the relationship when Charlie has an affair with Chelsea's best friend). Stacy Keach (who plays Chelsea's father) and John Amos are absolutely hilarious in the series, cast as gay lovers.Alan's adventures are also revolve around the women in his life. His old girlfriend Melissa comes back, and even moves into Charlie's beach pad for a short time. Then Alan has a series of dating disasters, the funniest occurs when he tries out a spray on hair product. He ends up with a new girlfried - a mother of Jakes first male friend in the series. The kid's a brat and the mother is no bargin, but I guess Alan figures beggars can't be choosers.Jake has a few episodes dedicated to him. One in which Charlie gives him really bad advice, that ends his relationship, and another where the Arguing between Charlie and Alan becomes intolerable and embarrasing for him, and he decides he doesn't want to come to Charlie house anymore.The most bizarre episode in this season involves a threesome, where Charlie and Alan get so hammered that they end up waking up in bed together with a girl the had met in the bar the previous night. The flashbacks are disturbingly funny. The same woman shows up later in the series in a different role, as Charlies new wife. Yes! Charlie finally get married, or does he?You don't have to wait for the DVD's, I already have downloaded the entire series (I couldn't wait) although diehard fans may want to wait for them to get some of the extras. The season this year is shorter than usual due to our favorite bad boy's exploits in Aspen. I believe there were two more episodes cancelled because the real life Charlie has some serious woman and alcohol issues. He is a great actor and comedian and I hope someday he can level his ego and get some real help.",5,The best situation comedy of the year...again!,1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,2146,"['continuing', 'saga', 'Charlie', 'Alan', 'Jake', 'generate', 'lot', 'laughs', 'funny', 'situations.The', 'season', 'mostly', 'Charlie', 'again', 'off', 'again', 'relationship', 'fiancee', 'Chelsea', 'First', 'tempted', 'previous', 'fiancee', 'Mia', 'then', 'Chelsea', 'tempted', 'lawyer', 'Who', 'everything', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'are', 'also', 'complications', 'relationship', 'when', 'Charlie', 'affair', 'Chelsea', 'best', 'friend', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'who', 'Chelsea', 'father', 'John', 'Amos', 'are', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'series', 'cast', 'gay', 'lovers.Alan', 'adventures', 'are', 'also', 'revolve', 'women', 'life', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'Melissa', 'back', 'even', 'moves', 'Charlie', 'beach', 'pad', 'short', 'time', 'Then', 'Alan', 'series', 'dating', 'disasters', 'funniest', 'occurs', 'when', 'out', 'spray', 'hair', 'product', 'up', 'new', 'girlfried', 'mother', 'Jakes', 'first', 'male', 'friend', 'series', 'kid', 'brat', 'mother', 'bargin', 'guess', 'Alan', 'beggars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'choosers.Jake', 'few', 'episodes', 'dedicated', 'One', 'Charlie', 'really', 'bad', 'advice', 'relationship', 'where', 'Arguing', 'Charlie', 'Alan', 'intolerable', 'embarrasing', ""n't"", 'want', 'come', 'Charlie', 'house', 'most', 'bizarre', 'episode', 'season', 'threesome', 'where', 'Charlie', 'Alan', 'get', 'so', 'hammered', 'end', 'up', 'waking', 'up', 'bed', 'together', 'girl', 'had', 'met', 'bar', 'previous', 'night', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'disturbingly', 'funny', 'same', 'woman', 'up', 'later', 'series', 'different', 'role', 'Charlies', 'new', 'wife', 'Yes', 'Charlie', 'finally', 'get', 'married', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'DVD', 'already', 'have', 'downloaded', 'entire', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'diehard', 'fans', 'may', 'want', 'wait', 'get', 'extras', 'season', 'year', 'shorter', 'usual', 'due', 'favorite', 'bad', 'boy', 'exploits', 'Aspen', 'believe', 'were', 'two', 'more', 'episodes', 'cancelled', 'real', 'life', 'Charlie', 'serious', 'woman', 'alcohol', 'issues', 'great', 'actor', 'comedian', 'hope', 'someday', 'can', 'level', 'ego', 'get', 'real', 'help']",N/A

Watching these hapless people ruining their lives is full of great jokes and the most terrible all-pervading sadness.  The saddest of course is Charlie (Harper and Sheen) -- watching him degenerate and lose everything is almost unwatcheable.  His brother is a castrate; his nephew is hopeless; his mother is a harpie; his girlfriend is eventually driven off.  It is all very funny and increasingly horrible.  No one has our sympathy any more, they are all increasingly repellent (Ben Jonson's plays are the nearest classical equivalent).  It is interesting that as the show becomes sadder and sadder, the humour is becoming more and more childish and flatulent:  the characters are turning ever more into types/caricatures and all flailing around in a sequence of futile catastrophes as they rapidly descend into a variety of self-made scatological hells.It is hard to think of a better snapshot of the barrenness of contemporary life than this series.

I explained the appeal of the show to me as that of a modern take on ""The Three Stooges"".  It's all about the ridiculous situations in which these three fellows find themselves!  I see Charlie as analogous to Moe--the smartest of the three and the leader of the group--but still a complete dunce with a completely absurd take on the world.  Alan is analogous to Larry--and, as a result, routinely berated and beat up on by Moe.  And then you have Jake who occupies Curly's position in the trio--as the dumbest and funniest--but with an uncanny ability to maneuver through the minefield of the Harper household, complete with his dad and uncle's sexual antics.  Jake's character is the expansion of a good concept--don't make the kid in the show a precocious jerk (I am so tired of that!)--instead make him an amusing dolt!The rest of cast is great too--from Melanie Lynskey as Charlie's kooky but good-hearted stalker--to various guest stars as Charlie and Allen's wide range of girl friends.  I love the episode where Kevin Sorbo (from Xena/Hercules) plays the dimwitted dad of Alan's second ex-wife (and Charlie's erstwhile hook-up) Candi (the hilariously mindless stoogette April Bowlby)!  And the one where Rose positions herself as Allen's blind double date with Charlie and Chelsea is fantastic!  (I am not sure that these two episodes were from the seventh season though)  Ryan Stiles is great as the freshly emasculated second husband of Allen's harpyish first wife Judith.I could go on and on about what a great job the writers and actors do on this show, but I'll stop here.",5,"A modern ""Three Stooges""",1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,1756,"['really', 'love', 'show', 'much', 'wife', 'disbelief', 'who', 'told', 'were', 'not', 'such', 'popular', 'show', 'would', 'think', 'something', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'explained', 'appeal', 'show', 'modern', 'take', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'ridiculous', 'situations', 'three', 'fellows', 'find', 'see', 'Charlie', 'as', 'analogous', 'Moe', 'smartest', 'three', 'leader', 'group', 'still', 'complete', 'dunce', 'completely', 'absurd', 'take', 'world', 'Alan', 'analogous', 'Larry', 'result', 'routinely', 'berated', 'beat', 'up', 'Moe', 'then', 'have', 'Jake', 'who', 'Curly', 'position', 'trio', 'dumbest', 'funniest', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'maneuver', 'minefield', 'Harper', 'household', 'complete', 'dad', 'uncle', 'sexual', 'antics', 'Jake', 'character', 'expansion', 'good', 'concept', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'kid', 'show', 'precocious', 'jerk', 'am', 'so', 'tired', 'instead', 'make', 'amusing', 'dolt', 'rest', 'cast', 'great', 'too', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'Charlie', 'kooky', 'good-hearted', 'stalker', 'various', 'guest', 'stars', 'Charlie', 'Allen', 'wide', 'range', 'girl', 'friends', 'love', 'episode', 'where', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'Xena/Hercules', 'dimwitted', 'dad', 'Alan', 'second', 'ex-wife', 'Charlie', 'erstwhile', 'hook-up', 'Candi', 'hilariously', 'mindless', 'stoogette', 'April', 'Bowlby', 'one', 'where', 'Rose', 'positions', 'Allen', 'blind', 'double', 'date', 'Charlie', 'Chelsea', 'fantastic', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'two', 'episodes', 'were', 'seventh', 'season', 'Ryan', 'Stiles', 'great', 'freshly', 'emasculated', 'second', 'husband', 'Allen', 'harpyish', 'first', 'wife', 'Judith.I', 'could', 'go', 'what', 'great', 'job', 'writers', 'actors', 'do', 'show', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'here']",N/A
