The character Doctor Martin Bahnford originally appeared in the film ""Saving Grace"" as the local doctor. This movie and the other(Doc Martin and the legend of the cloutie) takes place before this, and tells how he got to little town in Port Issac. Later the character was changed into Doctor Martin Ellingham in the TV series ""Doc Martin"".So, this is not the same character as in the show, though I think you will enjoy this if you like the TV show or the movie ""Saving Grace"" (I love both).Anyways, in this movie Doc Martin, a surgeon, runs away from his cheating wife to a small town in Port Issac. Here he ends up fishing and finds himself caught in the mystery of ""the jelly maker"". I don't want to spoil what the jelly maker does...but it is one of the most hilarious things that I have ever heard of or seen, and it is worth buying this just to see this hilarious plot. Many other things along the way are humorous, and there are scenes where the doc helps sick people.I find the character Doctor Martin Bahnford to be a very interesting because he can be very nice to people (unlike the one in the TV show), yet still yell at things in humourous ways. Also, a few characters from ""Saving Grace"" are carried over and all of the locals, though they are crazy, are very likable. All great acting.Anyways, I highly reccomend this to anyone especially if you enjoy the movie ""Saving Grace"", the show ""Doc Martin"", British TV, or just a very good and funny movie.",5,The jelly maker is coming for you...,1344038400,"08 4, 2012",2012,1548,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'TV', 'series', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'thought', 'would', 'like', 'movies', 'character', 'Doctor', 'Martin', 'Bahnford', 'originally', 'appeared', 'film', 'Saving', 'Grace', 'local', 'doctor', 'movie', 'other', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'legend', 'cloutie', 'place', 'how', 'got', 'little', 'town', 'Port', 'Issac', 'Later', 'character', 'was', 'changed', 'Doctor', 'Martin', 'Ellingham', 'TV', 'series', 'Doc', 'Martin', '.So', 'not', 'same', 'character', 'show', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'like', 'TV', 'show', 'movie', 'Saving', 'Grace', 'love', '.Anyways', 'movie', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'surgeon', 'away', 'cheating', 'wife', 'small', 'town', 'Port', 'Issac', 'Here', 'up', 'fishing', 'caught', 'mystery', 'jelly', 'maker', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'what', 'jelly', 'maker', 'one', 'most', 'hilarious', 'things', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'seen', 'worth', 'buying', 'just', 'see', 'hilarious', 'plot', 'Many', 'other', 'things', 'way', 'are', 'humorous', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'doc', 'sick', 'people.I', 'find', 'character', 'Doctor', 'Martin', 'Bahnford', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'nice', 'people', 'one', 'TV', 'show', 'yet', 'still', 'yell', 'things', 'humourous', 'ways', 'Also', 'few', 'characters', 'Saving', 'Grace', 'are', 'carried', 'locals', 'are', 'crazy', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'great', 'acting.Anyways', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'anyone', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Saving', 'Grace', 'show', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'British', 'TV', 'just', 'very', 'good', 'funny', 'movie']",DOC MARTIN: THE MOVIES

Although not the same character, Doc Martin Bamford is an entertaining enough character and keeps things sufficiently stirred up in his small village in Cornwall. We can be grateful to the three prequel films that were instrumental in the development of the Doc Martin character, especially as it finally evolved in the TV series.It is interesting to catch scenic glimpses of sites that were to be made famous in the TV series such as Doc Martin's office and the church/school on the cliff. In the prequel films the location is called Port Isaac, the real name of the village, whereas in the TV series the name is changed to Port Wenn. There seems to be some division as to the proper spelling of Port Wenn, some spelling it Portwenn; as the village only exists in the imagination I suppose that doesn't really matter. Most of the spellings generated by Port Isaac publicity seem to favor the Port Wenn version.The main reason we watched this film was our enjoyment of the TV series and the charming scenery to be found in Port Isaac.

1435425,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B0050N0UR0,Doug Erlandson,"[0, 0]","These two Doc Martin movies came out prior to the TV series. Those who have already seen the series (as I had before I watched the movies) will immediately recognize that, although Martin Clunes plays the Doc in both the movies and the series, his personality is amazingly different. The Doc of the movies eats junk food, drinks beer, smokes cigarettes (and pot), sometimes dresses casually (not always in a suit and tie), and actually smiles and is reasonably friendly to the rest of humanity, including his patients. Moreover, he hasn't developed his hemophobia yet, and he is an obstetrician by trade (rather than a surgeon), who has escaped to Port Isaac (still called by its real name rather than Portwenn) after finding out that his wife was cheating on him. The townsfolk are almost totally different from those in the TV series.

1435432,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B0050N0UR0,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[176, 177]","Two feature length stories take the character of Doc Martin Bamford (Martin Clunes) and remove him from a London obstetric practice and places him in Port Isaac, Cornwall. You'll love this scenery as much as in ""Doc Martin: collection - Series 1-4"", for those who, like me, watched the TV series first and now catch-up with the movies. They are great in their own right. It's true, SOME of the characters in this double-feature were first created by Craig Ferguson & Mark Crowdy in ""Saving Grace"", but I did not care for that first introduction of Martin nearly as well as these two stories. To be fair, most Amazon reviewers disagree with me on S.Grace.Besides Clunes, carryover characters for both films include lobsterman Harvey (Tristan Sturrock who also played Harvey in S.Grace & Danny Steel in the TV series); Justine (Barbara Lott-`Ballet Shoes') a nosy shopkeeper; lovely Rita (Neve McIntosh-`Lady Audley's Secret') almost a lover; Petronella (Lynsey Baxter) the wife/cheater who caused Martin to leave; Cabbie Mitch (Mark Heap-a superstar postman in ""Lark Rise to Candleford""); Pub owner Charley (Paul Brooke-""Bridget Jones Diary' and also Charlie in S.Grace); & Vicar (Stephen Moore). It's a stellar cast, good writing, and fantastic setting. You will notice similarities from scenes in these films, the TV series, & Saving Grace. All were filmed in Port Isaac, but in the TV series the name changed to Portwenn. The locals of this double feature as every bit as eccentric and delightfully common as those in the TV series. Awesome pub-style music by Mark Thomas.Doc Martin- 87 minutes with SUBTITLESDoc Bamford discovers his 3 doctor friends have been bedding his wife Petronella. Thus the trip to seclusion, which ends in Port Isaac mud and a lobster boat gig. From there the relationships develop as well as difficulty when the town's newcomer is accused of being the evil fiend secretly passing jellies (molded gelatin) with an embedded photo. You'll also get an adult view (not for kids) of a couple (combined weight well over a quarter ton) making love, drug use, nudity, sexual situations, and medical scenes, most of that warned about on the box. With that comes belly laughs, characters you'll never forget (even if you want to), and some top acting. It's not exactly the same as ""Doc Martin: 1-4 TV Series"" but just as good. Clunes is the only actor that carried to the TV series as the same character. In the later, Clunes picks up some of the curmudgeon traits that was seen in Dr. Cadbury (Jeremy Child-see ""First Among Equals"") in this film.Doc Martin and the Legend of the Cloutie- 75 minutes with SUBTITLESA cloutie is a cloth piece tied to a branch and a wish comes true as it rots. Doc Martin Bamford (Doc Martin was an Ellingham in the series) stoops to cloutie-ing to get an out-of-the-way home he fights over with the London Bowden development family. Family boss, Mrs Bowden is Anna chancellor (Four Weddings and a Funeral). Doc gets a bra strap cloutie from Lolita (Pam Ferris-`Jane Eyre' `Little Doritt' `Darling Buds of May' +). He even terrorizes kids. This film has duo-plots. There is also smuggling taking place, and of course the Doc gets caught in all sorts of illegal dealings. Enter the custom agents. Hilarious. The fat second in command, Lester (Steven O'Donnell) has few lines but makes up for it in action and expression. He is a gut busting comic, stealing scene after scene. It's easy to see why the response was so great after this film that the series was started. Watch closely in this film, the house front of Rita's place becomes Doc Martin Ellingham's Portween office a few years later.Not enough of Martin Clunes yet?Take a look at the NEW series ""Reggie Perrin"" & an older series ""Demob"" & ""Lorna Doone"" 2000.",5,Martin Clunes polishes Doc Martin prior to the TV series,1310601600,"07 14, 2011",2011,3767,"['Two', 'feature', 'length', 'stories', 'take', 'character', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Bamford', 'Martin', 'Clunes', 'remove', 'London', 'obstetric', 'practice', 'places', 'Port', 'Isaac', 'Cornwall', ""'ll"", 'love', 'scenery', 'as', 'much', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'collection', '1-4', 'who', 'watched', 'TV', 'series', 'first', 'now', 'catch-up', 'movies', 'are', 'great', 'own', 'right', 'true', 'SOME', 'characters', 'double-feature', 'were', 'first', 'created', 'Craig', 'Ferguson', 'Mark', 'Crowdy', 'Saving', 'Grace', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'first', 'introduction', 'Martin', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'stories', 'be', 'fair', 'most', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'disagree', 'S.Grace.Besides', 'Clunes', 'carryover', 'characters', 'films', 'include', 'lobsterman', 'Harvey', 'Tristan', 'Sturrock', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'Harvey', 'S.Grace', 'Danny', 'Steel', 'TV', 'series', 'Justine', 'Barbara', 'Lott-', 'Ballet', 'Shoes', 'nosy', 'shopkeeper', 'lovely', 'Rita', 'Neve', 'McIntosh-', 'Lady', 'Audley', 'Secret', 'almost', 'lover', 'Petronella', 'Lynsey', 'Baxter', 'wife/cheater', 'who', 'caused', 'Martin', 'leave', 'Cabbie', 'Mitch', 'Mark', 'Heap-a', 'superstar', 'postman', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', 'Pub', 'owner', 'Charley', 'Paul', 'Brooke-', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'also', 'Charlie', 'S.Grace', 'Vicar', 'Stephen', 'Moore', 'stellar', 'cast', 'good', 'writing', 'fantastic', 'setting', 'will', 'notice', 'similarities', 'scenes', 'films', 'TV', 'series', 'Saving', 'Grace', 'were', 'filmed', 'Port', 'Isaac', 'TV', 'series', 'name', 'changed', 'Portwenn', 'locals', 'double', 'feature', 'bit', 'eccentric', 'delightfully', 'common', 'TV', 'series', 'Awesome', 'pub-style', 'music', 'Mark', 'Thomas.Doc', 'Martin-', '87', 'minutes', 'SUBTITLESDoc', 'Bamford', '3', 'doctor', 'friends', 'have', 'been', 'bedding', 'wife', 'Petronella', 'Thus', 'trip', 'seclusion', 'Port', 'Isaac', 'mud', 'lobster', 'boat', 'gig', 'relationships', 'develop', 'as', 'well', 'difficulty', 'when', 'town', 'newcomer', 'accused', 'being', 'evil', 'fiend', 'secretly', 'passing', 'jellies', 'molded', 'gelatin', 'embedded', 'photo', ""'ll"", 'also', 'get', 'adult', 'view', 'not', 'kids', 'couple', 'combined', 'weight', 'well', 'quarter', 'ton', 'making', 'love', 'drug', 'use', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'situations', 'medical', 'scenes', 'most', 'warned', 'box', 'belly', 'laughs', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'even', 'want', 'top', 'acting', 'not', 'exactly', 'same', 'Doc', 'Martin', '1-4', 'TV', 'Series', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Clunes', 'only', 'actor', 'carried', 'TV', 'series', 'same', 'character', 'later', 'Clunes', 'up', 'curmudgeon', 'traits', 'was', 'seen', 'Dr.', 'Cadbury', 'Jeremy', 'Child-see', 'First', 'Equals', 'film.Doc', 'Martin', 'Legend', 'Cloutie-', '75', 'minutes', 'SUBTITLESA', 'cloutie', 'cloth', 'piece', 'tied', 'branch', 'wish', 'true', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Bamford', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'was', 'Ellingham', 'series', 'cloutie-ing', 'get', 'out-of-the-way', 'home', 'London', 'Bowden', 'development', 'family', 'Family', 'boss', 'Mrs', 'Bowden', 'Anna', 'chancellor', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Doc', 'bra', 'strap', 'cloutie', 'Lolita', 'Pam', 'Ferris-', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Little', 'Doritt', 'Darling', 'Buds', 'May', '+', 'even', 'kids', 'film', 'duo-plots', 'also', 'smuggling', 'taking', 'place', 'course', 'Doc', 'caught', 'sorts', 'illegal', 'dealings', 'Enter', 'custom', 'agents', 'Hilarious', 'fat', 'second', 'command', 'Lester', 'Steven', ""O'Donnell"", 'few', 'lines', 'up', 'action', 'expression', 'gut', 'busting', 'comic', 'stealing', 'scene', 'scene', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'response', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'film', 'series', 'was', 'started', 'Watch', 'closely', 'film', 'house', 'front', 'Rita', 'place', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Ellingham', 'Portween', 'office', 'few', 'years', 'later.Not', 'enough', 'Martin', 'Clunes', 'yet', 'Take', 'look', 'NEW', 'series', 'Reggie', 'Perrin', 'older', 'series', 'Demob', 'Lorna', 'Doone', '2000']",DOC MARTIN: THE MOVIES

That said, I still found the movies charming in their own right and Martin Clunes' acting talent really shines through.  Clunes plays a cigarette-smoking, whiskey-drinking party man with a lot of problems who runs off to Port Isaac as an escape (that's all I will say so as to not give away too much plot).  It's a great character who I find sad, endearing, and revolting at the same time - a huge range that really shows off Clunes' acting.  The characters who live in the village are quirky and not sure what to do with Dr Martin - and thus funny situations emerge.I recommend this film, but don't get it if you are looking for it to be like the tv show.

Those of us who enjoy our Martin Clunes as Doc Martin fix have been waiting with baited breath.The good news is that they give us more of what we love. The not as good news is that the two films, made prior to the commissioning of the actual series, feature characters and characteristics that are simply not as fun as those which were developed for the show.Perhaps it is the irritating but endearing character of the doctor himself, with his blood phobia (a brilliant character touch). How much more interesting and original is that compared to a wife&#8217;s infidelity? Another characteristic of the doctor featured in these films, is that he regularly smokes marijuana. This appears to be a nod to the original feature film &#8220;Saving Grace&#8221;, in which Doc Martin was first introduced.I&#8217;d rather see an uptight doctor than one given to what many still consider (as I do) a vice. Drug use, in my view, is not funny. If these films are to be believed, half the population of the idyllic little Cornish village where the stories are set, are tokers. Nothing charming or quaint about that.But these are minor quirks in light of the bigger picture, which is the origin of Doc Martin. It is admittedly fun to compare how these foundational films were changed, developed and honed into the beloved series that is still being produced in 2011.This is one reviewer who doesn&#8217;t like to summarize plots in reviews, but rather chooses to talk about production values, actors and various related subjects which may or may not guide a potential viewer to a particular film or program. DOC MARTIN: THE MOVIES is as picturesque as the series, and is certainly entertaining, but the spark that makes the series so utterly addictive is missing. The characters and the writing simply had a ways to go from these early efforts.Thankfully, for the sheer joy of the viewer, they succeeded.DOC MARTIN: THE MOVIES is a necessary set for the DOC MARTIN completionist, but be suitably warned: the best was yet to come.",3,The series is better.,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,2149,"['was', 'inevitable', 'two', 'made-for-TV', 'DOC', 'MARTIN', 'films', 'would', 'make', 'DVD', 'given', 'enormous', 'success', 'current', 'series', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Martin', 'Clunes', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'fix', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'baited', 'breath.The', 'good', 'news', 'give', 'more', 'what', 'love', 'not', 'good', 'news', 'two', 'films', 'made', 'prior', 'commissioning', 'actual', 'series', 'feature', 'characters', 'characteristics', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'as', 'fun', 'were', 'developed', 'show.Perhaps', 'irritating', 'endearing', 'character', 'doctor', 'blood', 'phobia', 'brilliant', 'character', 'touch', 'How', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'original', 'compared', 'wife', '8217', 'infidelity', 'characteristic', 'doctor', 'featured', 'films', 'regularly', 'marijuana', 'be', 'nod', 'original', 'feature', 'film', '8220', 'Saving', 'Grace', '8221', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'was', 'first', 'introduced.I', '8217', 'rather', 'see', 'uptight', 'doctor', 'one', 'given', 'what', 'many', 'still', 'consider', 'do', 'vice', 'Drug', 'use', 'view', 'not', 'funny', 'films', 'are', 'be', 'believed', 'population', 'idyllic', 'little', 'Cornish', 'village', 'where', 'stories', 'are', 'set', 'are', 'tokers', 'Nothing', 'charming', 'quaint', 'that.But', 'are', 'minor', 'quirks', 'light', 'bigger', 'picture', 'origin', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'admittedly', 'fun', 'compare', 'how', 'foundational', 'films', 'were', 'changed', 'developed', 'honed', 'beloved', 'series', 'still', 'being', 'produced', '2011.This', 'one', 'reviewer', 'who', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'summarize', 'plots', 'reviews', 'rather', 'talk', 'production', 'values', 'actors', 'various', 'related', 'subjects', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'guide', 'potential', 'viewer', 'particular', 'film', 'program', 'DOC', 'MARTIN', 'MOVIES', 'as', 'picturesque', 'series', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'spark', 'series', 'so', 'utterly', 'addictive', 'missing', 'characters', 'writing', 'simply', 'had', 'ways', 'go', 'early', 'efforts.Thankfully', 'sheer', 'joy', 'viewer', 'succeeded.DOC', 'MARTIN', 'MOVIES', 'necessary', 'set', 'DOC', 'MARTIN', 'completionist', 'be', 'suitably', 'warned', 'best', 'was', 'yet', 'come']",DOC MARTIN: THE MOVIES

I don't think most people would be disappointed, HOWEVER, to fans of the TV series, I must warn you that this Doc is NOT the same surly Doc from the ITV television show.If you've ever noticed the end credits to an episode of DOC MARTIN, you might have noticed the credit ""arising from the film SAVING GRACE."" That is because the character of Doc Martin is based on the character Dr. Martin Bamford from that movie, who was also played by Clunes, and which was also set in the same fishing village (except under its real name of Port Isaac rather than the made-up name of Port Wenn).After the film SAVING GRACE came out, Clunes' production company decided they'd like to do some more with the character and signed a deal with Sky television to produce a series of made-for-TV movies: two a year for what was to have been a three-year deal. The two movies in this collection, ""Doc Martin"" and ""Doc Martin and the Legend of the Cloutie"" were the only two that were made (as Sky Pictures went under before any others could be produced).Both telefilms are ""prequels"" to SAVING GRACE and take place in the same ""universe"". In other words, the locations are the same and some of the supporting cast are the same. The first telefilm tells the story of how the Doc leaves behind city life to be in the country. The second film shows him as more-or-less established in the village.To use a comic-book/sci-fi analogy, these movies (including SAVING GRACE) are set in a parallel universe to the ITV show.",5,"These are GREAT, but fans be warned: this Doc is a totally different character!",1308009600,"06 14, 2011",2011,1669,"['have', 'Australian/Region', '4', 'discs', 'two', 'DOC', 'MARTIN', 'movies', 'were', 'released', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'have', 'gone', 'out-of-print', '.Firstly', 'movies', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'HOWEVER', 'fans', 'TV', 'series', 'must', 'warn', 'Doc', 'NOT', 'same', 'surly', 'Doc', 'ITV', 'television', 'show.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'noticed', 'end', 'episode', 'DOC', 'MARTIN', 'might', 'have', 'noticed', 'credit', 'arising', 'film', 'SAVING', 'GRACE', 'character', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'based', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Bamford', 'movie', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'played', 'Clunes', 'was', 'also', 'set', 'same', 'fishing', 'village', 'real', 'name', 'Port', 'Isaac', 'rather', 'made-up', 'name', 'Port', 'Wenn', '.After', 'film', 'SAVING', 'GRACE', 'came', 'out', 'Clunes', 'production', 'company', 'decided', ""'d"", 'like', 'do', 'more', 'character', 'signed', 'deal', 'Sky', 'television', 'produce', 'series', 'made-for-TV', 'movies', 'two', 'year', 'what', 'was', 'have', 'been', 'three-year', 'deal', 'two', 'movies', 'collection', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Legend', 'Cloutie', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'were', 'made', 'Sky', 'Pictures', 'went', 'others', 'could', 'be', 'produced', 'telefilms', 'are', 'prequels', 'SAVING', 'GRACE', 'take', 'place', 'same', 'universe', 'other', 'words', 'locations', 'are', 'same', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'same', 'first', 'telefilm', 'story', 'how', 'Doc', 'city', 'life', 'be', 'country', 'second', 'film', 'more-or-less', 'established', 'village.To', 'use', 'comic-book/sci-fi', 'analogy', 'movies', 'including', 'SAVING', 'GRACE', 'are', 'set', 'parallel', 'universe', 'ITV', 'show']",DOC MARTIN: THE MOVIES

We do not get it on our system in Midland, and never heard of the character, these two films, or the subsequent series. The first movie started a bit slow for me, and was nearly half over before I made a committment to stick with it. There was a broken marriage plot in it that was not very humorous, and it took me awhile to understand some accents. The second half of that movie was much better. The second film is played more for laughs, and it delivers, and benefits from the viewer now knowing how the doctor got to Cornwall and why. Having now seen these two productions, I would like to rent a season's worth of the later series, although I am aware there have been some major changes in supporting characters.",4,Quirky British made for TV films that lead to a series...,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,933,"['mother-in-law', 'gave', 'set', 'daughter', 'Christmas', '83', 'dummy', 'told', 'husband', 'love', 'television', 'series', 'can', 'get', 'cable', 'system', 'San', 'Angelo', 'Texas', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'system', 'Midland', 'never', 'heard', 'character', 'two', 'films', 'subsequent', 'series', 'first', 'movie', 'started', 'bit', 'slow', 'was', 'nearly', 'half', 'made', 'committment', 'stick', 'was', 'broken', 'marriage', 'plot', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'humorous', 'took', 'awhile', 'understand', 'accents', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'second', 'film', 'played', 'more', 'laughs', 'benefits', 'viewer', 'now', 'knowing', 'how', 'doctor', 'got', 'Cornwall', 'why', 'Having', 'now', 'seen', 'two', 'productions', 'would', 'like', 'rent', 'season', 'worth', 'later', 'series', 'am', 'aware', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'changes', 'supporting', 'characters']",DOC MARTIN: THE MOVIES

This doctor is friendlier and more in tune with his emotions and those of the people he encounters. The writing, the scenery and the acting are just as good as those in the series, and despite being far more &#34;normal&#34; than the Doc in the series, I loved these movies just as much! I have read how Martin Clunes himself felt that the character needed to change when asked to do the series, and I believe he was the one who recommended the quirky, socially-awkward character we know in the TV show. I think it is a nice peek into the minds of the TV shows creators how this beloved character evolved even during the production phases!",5,I love Doc Martin and these earlier movies show how the character evolved in the minds of the TV Show's creators!,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,800,"['know', 'character', 'TV', 'series', 'then', 'prepare', 'alternate-reality', 'version', 'beloved', 'socially-awkward', 'doctor', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'doctor', 'friendlier', 'more', 'tune', 'emotions', 'people', 'writing', 'scenery', 'acting', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'series', 'being', 'far', 'more', '34', 'normal', '34', 'Doc', 'series', 'loved', 'movies', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'have', 'read', 'how', 'Martin', 'felt', 'character', 'needed', 'change', 'when', 'asked', 'do', 'series', 'believe', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'recommended', 'quirky', 'socially-awkward', 'character', 'know', 'TV', 'show', 'think', 'nice', 'peek', 'minds', 'TV', 'creators', 'how', 'beloved', 'character', 'evolved', 'even', 'production']",DOC MARTIN: THE MOVIES
