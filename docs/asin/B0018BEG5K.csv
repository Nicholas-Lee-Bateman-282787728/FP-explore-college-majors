1159523,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B0018BEG5K,Addicted2Amazon!,"[9, 11]","Let me begin by stating that I am a HUGE fan of The Firm's new line of workout DVDs.  I find them addictively fun, energizing, challenging and they have left me with the sexiest body I've ever had and will ever have.  That being said, I found this particular title a little...lacking.My 1st problem:  The production quality of this program is dismal!  I absolutely loved the original bright window set (seen in pretty much every early ""pink box"" DVD such as ""Ultimate Fat Burning Workout,"" """"Slim & Sculpt Stability Ball Workout,""""Bootcamp: Max Calorie Burn,"" etc.). Very cheery and just pleasant.  It put me in a good mood!  The 2nd set (used in ""Cardio Core Fusion,"" Cardio Dance Fusion,"" ""Power Half Hour,"" etc.) is also nice with the ""Mediterranean-style"" view in the background.  Also gives me a little bit of escapism.  And then, for some reason, they changed to this set.Ugh! It reminds me of a basement! Dark and depressing.  No light at all. The workout actors all seem to have dark circles and hollow cheeks just because of the horrible lighting.  Furthermore, the music is barely audible, but the sound of feet hitting the floor is VERY audible. For me, one of the components that make a great workout is good, energizing music, and the fact that it is so low here is a shame, b/c if I turn my TV up VERY loud, I can  (barely) hear that it is a decent soundtrack.Now on to the workout itself.  Like most Firm workouts, it alternates cardio with sculpting in a cycle. This particular workout is about an hour, and has 3 cardio segments interspersed with 3 sculpting segments. However, the sculpting segments are not the traditional 4-limb variety that has made The Firm so effective.  There is lower body toning (using a resistance loop that comes with the DVD), then upper body toning (using one pair of dumbbells), then abs sculpting (again using the resistance loop).  Now, I LOVED using the loop.  One (slight, for me) problem: The loop that is used in the DVD is NOT the same as the one you are given. The loop Alison and crew utilize obviously has more give and is able to be stretched further. Yours will (at least initially) hardly stretch at all. As a result, you may become frustrated when you cannot do a move as large/wide as you are supposed to (i.e. they will lift their leg knee level and you won't be able to get yours 2 inches off the ground!). However, I really enjoy fitness tools and was happy to find a different way to tone my body other than the usual (though very effective) methods. So what if I can't stretch it that far?  I still enjoy using it! However, because you are only sculpting one part of your body at a time, it is not nearly as intense. I found my heart rate lowered considerably during these sculpting sections.The cardio is very high impact with lots of hopping and a little bit of plyo jumping. As far as intensity goes, however, the only truly intense segment (in my opinion) is the 2nd one.  It goes from hamstring curls with a hop, to a Nordi-Track-like ski move that kicks my rear!  Then there's that side-to-side ski move...I get pretty winded!  And then my heart comes back down again with the last cardio, which is fun but not terribly challenging.When all is said and done, I actually get the most use out of this title by using one of the express workout options in combination with another half hour workout DVD. For example, I do the Dangerous Curves Ahead Express Sculpt right after The Firm's Power Half Hour and I sweat and burn a TON! Or I do DCA Express Cardio right before another half hour toning DVD and again, I sweat a TON! But if I do this full workout as is, it's just not challenging enough. No real burn there!So in the end, DCA is not perfect, far from it, but the loop, for me, makes it worth it.  Something a little different!

It may look ""like nothing"" but you know, after using it-I felt my legs and abs like never before! I am now a SOLID BAND excersier! I hope the Firm makes more workouts using this band! GREAT DEAL! You can do a full 55 min workout-or do just cardio-or just the toning segments! FUN! I even use the band to tone my inner thighs, and legs even when I'm not using this dvd!! You can even fit the band in your purse and take it to work!!!! My only complaint on this workout is that I wish the toning parts (using the green band) were a little longer, and I hope and pray they make tons of more Firm workouts using the little ""green guy"". Alison is PERFECT when it comes to cueing. Her soft tone voice always puts you at ease-and she is motivating! If you do want a longer leg workout-I do the toning part of the lower body-then rewind and do it 2 or 3 times for extra toning too! Absolutly genious what they've done with this workout!

1159525,A37RIRXE3WECZ,B0018BEG5K,April Blake,"[5, 5]","I buy everything The Firm puts out, and for the longest time, I couldn't imagine a Firm workout without thinking of ""three sets of dumbbells, light, medium, and heavy"" and some kind of step.  Dangerous Curves Ahead is a departure from this formula.  The aerobic work is all done on the floor, and you use just one pair of light-ish dumbbells, plus the ""resistance loop.""  (The exercisers in this workout use The Firm's Cardio Weights, so if you already have these, you can choose how heavy you make your weights.  If not, you can use dumbbells you already own.  I use 5 pounds for this workout.)I was surprised at how effective this workout is.  I exercise 5-7 days a week, an hour at a time.  The footwork is fairly easy to pick up, especially if you're kind of used to Alison Davis' choreography.  There are a couple spots during the full workout where the cueing is a little off, but once you do the workout a few times, you'll know it well enough to know what's coming up.  The work you'll do with your dumbbells is fairly predictable and mostly 4-limb.  There's some good focus on triceps in this one.  The Resistance Loop must be a little more intense than the one Alison and Company use, because I've been at exercising for a while, and I found myself following Emily's ""beginner"" modification during the side-plank series.  But if the Resistance Loop is a little too tight for you to begin with, you could probably make your own by looping a Dyna Band so you'd have more stretch, then work your way up to the Resistance Loop that comes with this workout.What I particularly like about Dangerous Curves Ahead is that you're able to tailor this workout to the length of workout you have time for and to the kind of workout you want to do on a given day: cardio, sculpt/tone, or the whole 55-minute workout.  It isn't really geared for beginners, but it's definitely something you can modify (don't use the band or dumbbells, make the cardio moves less intense), and grow into.",5,Great Calorie Burn!,1225238400,"10 29, 2008",2008,1982,"['buy', 'everything', 'Firm', 'out', 'longest', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Firm', 'workout', 'thinking', 'three', 'sets', 'dumbbells', 'light', 'medium', 'heavy', 'kind', 'step', 'Dangerous', 'Curves', 'Ahead', 'departure', 'formula', 'aerobic', 'work', 'done', 'floor', 'use', 'just', 'one', 'pair', 'light-ish', 'dumbbells', 'resistance', 'loop', 'exercisers', 'workout', 'Firm', 'Cardio', 'Weights', 'so', 'already', 'have', 'can', 'choose', 'how', 'heavy', 'make', 'weights', 'not', 'can', 'use', 'dumbbells', 'already', 'own', 'use', '5', 'pounds', 'workout', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'effective', 'workout', 'exercise', '5-7', 'days', 'week', 'hour', 'time', 'footwork', 'fairly', 'easy', 'pick', 'up', 'especially', ""'re"", 'kind', 'used', 'Alison', 'Davis', 'choreography', 'are', 'couple', 'spots', 'full', 'workout', 'where', 'cueing', 'little', 'off', 'once', 'do', 'workout', 'few', 'times', ""'ll"", 'know', 'well', 'enough', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'up', 'work', ""'ll"", 'do', 'dumbbells', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'mostly', '4-limb', 'good', 'focus', 'triceps', 'one', 'Resistance', 'Loop', 'must', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'intense', 'one', 'Alison', 'Company', 'use', ""'ve"", 'been', 'exercising', 'while', 'found', 'following', 'Emily', 'beginner', 'modification', 'side-plank', 'series', 'Resistance', 'Loop', 'little', 'too', 'tight', 'begin', 'could', 'probably', 'make', 'own', 'looping', 'Dyna', 'Band', ""'d"", 'have', 'more', 'stretch', 'then', 'work', 'way', 'Resistance', 'Loop', 'particularly', 'about', 'Dangerous', 'Curves', 'Ahead', ""'re"", 'able', 'tailor', 'workout', 'length', 'workout', 'have', 'time', 'kind', 'workout', 'want', 'do', 'given', 'day', 'cardio', 'sculpt/tone', 'whole', '55-minute', 'workout', ""n't"", 'really', 'geared', 'beginners', 'definitely', 'something', 'can', 'modify', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'band', 'dumbbells', 'make', 'cardio', 'less', 'intense', 'grow']",The Firm: Dangerous Curves Ahead

This one falls somewhere towards the top of my ratings.What I liked:This is another video with Allison Davis-McLain as the lead. She is very motivating. I thought that Emily did a great job as the ""modifier."" There were a couple of new faces too that were energetic. Time did seem to cruise on by, I sweated, and my ab muscles ached the next day, which is always a good sign to me.What I didn't like:This video contained a lot of calf-pump type jumping exercises, which for me, is a killer on my knees and my calfs (Duh, right?).

I wasn't always a fan of theirs but their latest releases have been so good I am going back to them now and really enjoying them.  Alison is back and doing another terrific job with cuing and motivating you.  She's encouraging without being over the top and she lets you know what's up next in time to get it down.This workout uses a mix of aerobics with toning and comes with a cool looped band.  The intervals are about 8 minutes each and keep your heart rate up and tone your muscles at the same time which to me, seems to be the best way to shape up quick.  There is also ab work done on the floor so it really does get to your entire body.  It is probably best suited for intermediate to advanced exercisers and even for me (intermediate-ish), it's challenging enough.  My legs were burning while doing the lower-body portion and that gives me encouragement to keep going because I know I'm doing some good.I really enjoy this.

That is definitely NOT the case with this workout.  For a start, it is extremely repetitive, which is really really boring.  The workout just drags on and on it seems.  The aerobic moves are really wierd which is very hard on your knees and joints and ACL ligaments and achilles heel/calf muscles.  Trust me, if you've ever had one of these types of injuries, you don't want one again -- they are painful and take ages to heal.  Alison is an ok instructor and her cueing is ok but whoever choreographed this workout apparantly doesn't know anything about decent warm-ups, good variety (which is part of what keeps you motivated to do the workout again and again), and doesn't care about stupid moves that might create a painful injury).  I have another Firm workout where Alison is the instructor and it is also very repetitive -- maybe this instructor just prefers that type of workout but to me it's just plain boring.  Anyway, I'm in great shape -- I run, I bike, I swim and have a very active lifestyle.  I have been working out and competing for years and know which workouts are good and which ones aren't.  This one belongs in the latter category.  To recap: The aerobic moves are bizarre, the tempo is way too fast, it's highly repetitive and boring, and the moves will definitely get you an injury.  I think this workout should be called ""Dangerous Injuries Ahead""  because if you keep doing this workout, that's exactly what you will have.",1,TERRIBLE WORKOUT,1280448000,"07 30, 2010",2010,1660,"['like', 'Firm', 'have', 'several', 'fitness', 'videos', '10', '15', 'be', 'exact', 'videos', 'helped', 'get', 'great', 'shape', 'Firm', 'do', 'work', 'will', 'get', 'results', 'want', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'case', 'workout', 'start', 'extremely', 'repetitive', 'really', 'really', 'boring', 'workout', 'just', 'drags', 'aerobic', 'moves', 'are', 'really', 'wierd', 'very', 'hard', 'knees', 'joints', 'ACL', 'ligaments', 'achilles', 'heel/calf', 'muscles', 'Trust', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'one', 'types', 'injuries', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'one', 'again', 'are', 'painful', 'take', 'ages', 'heal', 'Alison', 'ok', 'instructor', 'cueing', 'ok', 'whoever', 'choreographed', 'workout', 'apparantly', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'decent', 'warm-ups', 'good', 'variety', 'part', 'what', 'motivated', 'do', 'workout', 'again', 'again', ""n't"", 'care', 'stupid', 'moves', 'might', 'create', 'painful', 'injury', 'have', 'Firm', 'workout', 'where', 'Alison', 'instructor', 'also', 'very', 'repetitive', 'maybe', 'instructor', 'just', 'prefers', 'type', 'workout', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'great', 'shape', 'run', 'bike', 'swim', 'have', 'very', 'active', 'lifestyle', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'competing', 'years', 'know', 'workouts', 'are', 'good', 'ones', 'are', ""n't"", 'one', 'belongs', 'latter', 'category', 'recap', 'aerobic', 'moves', 'are', 'bizarre', 'tempo', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'highly', 'repetitive', 'boring', 'moves', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'injury', 'think', 'workout', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'Dangerous', 'Injuries', 'Ahead', 'keep', 'doing', 'workout', 'exactly', 'what', 'will', 'have']",The Firm: Dangerous Curves Ahead
1159539,A3MFB2Z14O2ORN,B0018BEG5K,"Space Monkey ""exercise junkie""","[0, 0]","I am not a huge fan of Alison Davis' workouts by The Firm.  However, I decided to give this workout a chance after watching a preview of it on another Firm DVD I owned, and based on the positive reviews it got here on Amazon.  I'm glad I did; overall, I enjoyed this workout because it provides some very good cardio conditioning, and uses the loop in an effective way, not in a ""we're trying to sell more DVDs so we decided to use this little gadget to suck in more money"" kind of way.  Here's the breakdown:THE GOOD:1) Like I said, the cardio intervals are VERY GOOD.  They feature some higher-impact cardio moves, but I love to jump around while working out, so I found the combinations fun and easier to do than most of Alison's workouts.  They really got my heart rate up, and were long enough to get the job done.  All moves are done in the ""add on"" style, and are repeated enough times so you can actually master them.  Others might find this repetition boring, but I find it refreshing.2) There are two sculpting intervals--one for the lower body (1st) and one for the upper body (2nd).  The lower body sculpting interval uses the loop, and the exercises done with the loop were effective and easy to do.  For the upper body, you use light weights (I used 5 pounds), and, again, the exercises were simple and effective.3) The ab section at the end using the loop was good; at first, you might think the loop isn't going to do much, but she adds on newer moves, and then you really feel how the loop adds a new dimension to your workout.  For example, she does side plank raises first, and then has you lift the top leg with the loop around your ankles. . tough!3) Alison's cueing in this video, in my opinion, was MUCH better than in her other videos.  Not only did she tell you what move was coming, or whether or not she was starting a combo over from the top, but she also stated which leg you were starting on.  This last little cute helped me out immensely; I am not coordinated, and I need to be reminded what foot/leg to start on!  It made it much easier for me to master the moves.4) Emily does modify the moves in this video, and it's always nice to have a modifier there in case my feet get all tripped up learning the moves.  However, I wouldn't say she was modifying for beginners. . .this video, it seems, is geared more towards the intermediate/advanced exerciser.5) The workout is 55 minutes long, and I like that--it doesn't end too soon, so you feel like you got a great workout in.  I also love the fact that they broke up this workout into three smaller workouts--one that's just cardio, one that just includes the sculpting segments, and one for the ab/core.  This will be fabulous for days where you just want cardio and no sculpting, or vice-versa.NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:1) The loop that comes with the workout is VERY inflexible; I started the workout with that loop (it's green), but found I just couldn't do some of the exercises with a good range of motion.  I'm sure it just needs to be stretched out, but, on the first try of this workout, I didn't want to be ""hampered"" by the very thing that's supposed to work me.  Since I also ownThe FIRM Cardio-To-Go Kit, I used the pink loop that came with that kit--it was MUCH more flexible (I had never used it before this workout, so it hadn't been stretched out).  I will eventually use the green one, but didn't want to start using this workout frustrated.2) Someone new to The Firm and their ""add on"" style could be tripped up (literally!) with the fast pace of some of the combos. In the very last cardio section, it seemed like Alison was adding on moves at a much more rapid pace than in the previous sections, and some of the moves were a bit more dancey; I had the most trouble keeping up during this segment.I was actually surprised at how much I liked this workout.  I wouldn't say it's for someone looking for serious weight training; the sculpting segments weren't that intense.  I would say the ""dangerous curves"" are going to come by burning off fat during the intense cardio segments!  If you want some good cardio and strength training together, tryThe Firm: Get Chisel'd,Firm: 500 Calorie Workout, orMichelle Dozois: Your Body Breakthru - Your Best Body Circuit, Includes Free Resistance Band!.  However, if you're like me, and alternate strength and cardio days, this workout is perfect for your cardio days (just use light weights for the upper body segment).Edited to add:  The next day after doing this workout, my outer thighs were sore.  I didn't think using the band would be that intense, but apparently so--and I used the more flexible loop.  So, it's not just another fitness gadget--it was working some of my ""problem areas"" pretty good!",4,"Excellent cardio, and good use of the resistance loop.",1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,4740,"['am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Alison', 'Davis', 'workouts', 'Firm', 'However', 'decided', 'give', 'workout', 'chance', 'watching', 'preview', 'Firm', 'DVD', 'owned', 'based', 'positive', 'reviews', 'got', 'here', 'Amazon', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'overall', 'enjoyed', 'workout', 'very', 'good', 'cardio', 'conditioning', 'loop', 'effective', 'way', 'not', ""'re"", 'trying', 'sell', 'more', 'DVDs', 'decided', 'use', 'little', 'gadget', 'suck', 'more', 'money', 'kind', 'way', 'Here', 'breakdown', 'GOOD:1', 'said', 'cardio', 'intervals', 'are', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'feature', 'higher-impact', 'cardio', 'moves', 'love', 'jump', 'around', 'working', 'out', 'found', 'combinations', 'fun', 'easier', 'do', 'most', 'Alison', 'workouts', 'really', 'got', 'heart', 'rate', 'were', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'moves', 'are', 'done', 'add', 'style', 'are', 'repeated', 'enough', 'times', 'can', 'actually', 'master', 'Others', 'might', 'find', 'repetition', 'boring', 'find', 'are', 'two', 'sculpting', 'intervals', 'one', 'lower', 'body', '1st', 'one', 'upper', 'body', '2nd', 'lower', 'body', 'sculpting', 'interval', 'loop', 'exercises', 'done', 'loop', 'were', 'effective', 'easy', 'do', 'upper', 'body', 'use', 'light', 'weights', 'used', '5', 'pounds', 'again', 'exercises', 'were', 'simple', 'effective.3', 'ab', 'section', 'end', 'using', 'loop', 'was', 'good', 'first', 'might', 'think', 'loop', ""n't"", 'going', 'do', 'much', 'newer', 'moves', 'then', 'really', 'feel', 'how', 'loop', 'new', 'dimension', 'workout', 'example', 'side', 'plank', 'first', 'then', 'lift', 'top', 'leg', 'loop', 'ankles', 'tough', '3', 'Alison', 'cueing', 'video', 'opinion', 'was', 'MUCH', 'better', 'other', 'videos', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'tell', 'what', 'move', 'was', 'coming', 'not', 'was', 'starting', 'combo', 'top', 'also', 'stated', 'leg', 'were', 'starting', 'last', 'little', 'cute', 'helped', 'out', 'immensely', 'am', 'not', 'coordinated', 'need', 'be', 'reminded', 'what', 'foot/leg', 'start', 'made', 'much', 'easier', 'master', 'moves.4', 'Emily', 'modify', 'moves', 'video', 'always', 'nice', 'have', 'modifier', 'case', 'feet', 'get', 'tripped', 'up', 'learning', 'moves', 'However', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'modifying', 'beginners', '.this', 'video', 'geared', 'more', 'intermediate/advanced', 'exerciser.5', 'workout', '55', 'minutes', 'long', 'like', ""n't"", 'end', 'too', 'soon', 'feel', 'got', 'great', 'workout', 'also', 'love', 'fact', 'broke', 'up', 'workout', 'three', 'smaller', 'workouts', 'one', 'just', 'cardio', 'one', 'just', 'sculpting', 'segments', 'one', 'ab/core', 'will', 'be', 'fabulous', 'days', 'where', 'just', 'want', 'cardio', 'sculpting', 'vice-versa.NEEDS', 'IMPROVEMENT:1', 'loop', 'workout', 'VERY', 'inflexible', 'started', 'workout', 'loop', 'green', 'found', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'exercises', 'good', 'range', 'motion', ""'m"", 'sure', 'just', 'be', 'stretched', 'out', 'first', 'try', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'hampered', 'very', 'thing', 'supposed', 'work', 'also', 'ownThe', 'FIRM', 'Cardio-To-Go', 'Kit', 'used', 'pink', 'loop', 'came', 'kit', 'was', 'MUCH', 'more', 'flexible', 'had', 'never', 'used', 'workout', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'stretched', 'out', 'will', 'eventually', 'use', 'green', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'start', 'using', 'workout', 'frustrated.2', 'Someone', 'new', 'Firm', 'add', 'style', 'could', 'be', 'tripped', 'up', 'literally', 'fast', 'pace', 'combos', 'very', 'last', 'cardio', 'section', 'seemed', 'Alison', 'was', 'adding', 'moves', 'much', 'more', 'rapid', 'pace', 'previous', 'sections', 'moves', 'were', 'bit', 'more', 'dancey', 'had', 'most', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'up', 'segment.I', 'was', 'actually', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'workout', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'someone', 'looking', 'serious', 'weight', 'training', 'sculpting', 'segments', 'were', ""n't"", 'intense', 'would', 'say', 'dangerous', 'curves', 'are', 'going', 'come', 'burning', 'off', 'fat', 'intense', 'cardio', 'segments', 'want', 'good', 'cardio', 'strength', 'training', 'together', 'tryThe', 'Firm', 'Get', 'Chisel', ""'d"", 'Firm', '500', 'Calorie', 'Workout', 'orMichelle', 'Dozois', 'Body', 'Breakthru', 'Best', 'Body', 'Circuit', 'Includes', 'Free', 'Resistance', 'Band', 'However', ""'re"", 'alternate', 'strength', 'cardio', 'days', 'workout', 'perfect', 'cardio', 'days', 'just', 'use', 'light', 'weights', 'upper', 'body', 'segment', '.Edited', 'add', 'next', 'day', 'doing', 'workout', 'outer', 'thighs', 'were', 'sore', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'using', 'band', 'would', 'be', 'intense', 'apparently', 'so', 'used', 'more', 'flexible', 'loop', 'So', 'not', 'just', 'fitness', 'gadget', 'was', 'working', 'problem', 'areas', 'pretty', 'good']",The Firm: Dangerous Curves Ahead
