Street Hawk even though it was short lived it has become a classic like Knight Rider or even Airwolf and really the list could go on and on.The series starred Rex Smith as Jesse Mach an ex motorcycle cop turned police trouble-shooter.  For 13 episodes he wrode for justice and now this 1985 gem is coming to DVD a little later then what I had originally heard but atleast it will be soon.Now that Street Hawk and all of the other greats have been released we need to get Viper on DVD all 4 seasons.,5,"The Man, The Machine, Street Hawk",1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,576,"['80', 'was', 'not', 'shortage', 'good', 'television', 'thier', 'today', 'Street', 'Hawk', 'even', 'was', 'short', 'lived', 'become', 'classic', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'even', 'Airwolf', 'really', 'list', 'could', 'go', 'on.The', 'series', 'starred', 'Rex', 'Smith', 'Jesse', 'Mach', 'ex', 'motorcycle', 'cop', 'turned', 'police', 'trouble-shooter', '13', 'episodes', 'wrode', 'justice', 'now', '1985', 'gem', 'coming', 'DVD', 'little', 'later', 'then', 'what', 'had', 'originally', 'heard', 'will', 'be', 'soon.Now', 'Street', 'Hawk', 'other', 'greats', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'need', 'get', 'Viper', 'DVD', '4', 'seasons']",N/A

1336613,A6JWJ04824526,B003CNQPNS,Eric H.,"[1, 1]","I am giving this series a 3-star rating because when I put in the DVD and watched the pilot episode, then the next 2 episodes, it was obvious this not what I expected.  It was like they made the DVD from the series that ran 1984 to 1985 without cleaning it up.  It looks and sounds like the original series I watched some 30 yrs ago on a TV then.  I am frankly surprised they didn't clean up the DVD series of the show and cleaned up the subpar picture quality and sound, much like they do with most TV box sets.  And only 13 episodes?  I had thought it had more episodes than that back in the mid 80's when I watched it with my dad when it was on primetime TV.  I have a feeling they cancelled the show in 1985 mainly because it had so much competition with other action series like Airwolf, Knight Rider, Miami Vice, CHiPs (even thought they cancelled the show in 1983) and TJ Hooker.  All were superior in contending with this show, and I own all the box sets of those shows.  Surprised they have only released TJ Hooker Season 1 and 2, and that was in 2005.  So far they haven't released more episodes and CHiPs is another letdown, 2 seasons so far and that's it.  Don't get me wrong I always loved Street Hawk, just disappointed I paid $27 for what looks like it was a direct port of the show instead of remastering it.  Really, the other shows were cleaned up and sound was excellent in terms of picture and sound quality.",3,"A good series, bad sound and picture quality",1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,1428,"['am', 'giving', 'series', '3-star', 'rating', 'when', 'put', 'DVD', 'watched', 'pilot', 'episode', 'then', 'next', '2', 'episodes', 'was', 'obvious', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'was', 'made', 'DVD', 'series', 'ran', '1984', '1985', 'cleaning', 'up', 'original', 'series', 'watched', '30', 'yrs', 'ago', 'TV', 'then', 'am', 'frankly', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'clean', 'up', 'DVD', 'series', 'show', 'cleaned', 'up', 'subpar', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'much', 'do', 'most', 'TV', 'box', 'sets', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'had', 'thought', 'had', 'more', 'episodes', 'back', 'mid', '80', 'when', 'watched', 'dad', 'when', 'was', 'primetime', 'TV', 'have', 'feeling', 'cancelled', 'show', '1985', 'mainly', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'competition', 'other', 'action', 'series', 'Airwolf', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'CHiPs', 'even', 'thought', 'cancelled', 'show', '1983', 'TJ', 'Hooker', 'were', 'superior', 'contending', 'show', 'own', 'box', 'sets', 'shows', 'Surprised', 'have', 'only', 'released', 'TJ', 'Hooker', 'Season', '1', '2', 'was', '2005', 'So', 'far', 'have', ""n't"", 'released', 'more', 'episodes', 'CHiPs', 'letdown', '2', 'seasons', 'so', 'far', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'always', 'loved', 'Street', 'Hawk', 'just', 'disappointed', 'paid', '27', 'what', 'was', 'direct', 'port', 'show', 'instead', 'remastering', 'Really', 'other', 'shows', 'were', 'cleaned', 'up', 'sound', 'was', 'excellent', 'terms', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality']",N/A

Anyhow, this show has a lot going for it and I can only guess that it got canceled because it arrived after the other ""vehicle"" concept series had pretty much burned up all their fuel. Streek Hawk was about as silly and fun as AirWolf or Knight Rider. Rex Smith had good looks and plenty of smooth charm, but the show just didn't make the cut. Too bad. The bike looked badass, and the synth soundtrack from Europe's techo-New Age boys, Tangerine Dream, fit the futuristic proceedings to a Tee. I loved this short-lived series. It was one of the primary influences that got me into motorcycling.The series arrives on DVD in pretty good shape. The picture is decent for an 80's TV show; bright, strong colors and fairly sharp. Audio portion is equally good with no hissing, muffling or dropouts. Some nice extras add to the fun and value.Trivia tidbit: Artist Andrew Probert, was responsible for some of the coolest craft of the 1980's. He not only did the concept draft work on the Street Hawk bike, but also the Airwolf helicopter, insignia and flight suits, and he designed the Enterprise ""D"" from Star Trek: The Next Generation!",5,Too bad he never teamed up with Airwolf & Knight Rider,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,1187,"['would', 'have', 'been', '80', 'kid', 'nerd', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Anyhow', 'show', 'lot', 'going', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'got', 'canceled', 'arrived', 'other', 'vehicle', 'concept', 'series', 'had', 'pretty', 'much', 'burned', 'up', 'fuel', 'Streek', 'Hawk', 'was', 'about', 'silly', 'fun', 'AirWolf', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'Rex', 'Smith', 'had', 'good', 'looks', 'plenty', 'smooth', 'charm', 'show', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'cut', 'Too', 'bad', 'bike', 'looked', 'badass', 'synth', 'soundtrack', 'Europe', 'techo-New', 'Age', 'boys', 'Tangerine', 'Dream', 'fit', 'futuristic', 'proceedings', 'Tee', 'loved', 'short-lived', 'series', 'was', 'one', 'primary', 'influences', 'got', 'motorcycling.The', 'series', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'shape', 'picture', 'decent', '80', 'TV', 'show', 'bright', 'strong', 'colors', 'fairly', 'sharp', 'Audio', 'portion', 'equally', 'good', 'hissing', 'muffling', 'dropouts', 'nice', 'extras', 'add', 'fun', 'value.Trivia', 'tidbit', 'Artist', 'Andrew', 'Probert', 'was', 'responsible', 'coolest', 'craft', '1980', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'concept', 'draft', 'work', 'Street', 'Hawk', 'bike', 'also', 'Airwolf', 'helicopter', 'insignia', 'flight', 'suits', 'designed', 'Enterprise', 'D', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation']",N/A
1336615,A1Q5XGU35UY2YJ,B003CNQPNS,"J. Elliott ""book raven""","[1, 1]","I loved watching this in the 80's and I am glad it has finally come to DVD. Long overdue! Street Hawk was a show in and of itself and less campy than Knight Rider. It is a classic example of the more imaginative shows of that era.As the packaging indicates the DVD includes the entire series, which was way too short in my opinion. There are a fair amount of extras on the second DVD which includes an interview about the making of Street Hawk with the two main stars: heart throb Rex Smith and Joe Regalbuto which is very good, there are also production pictures and diagrams of the bike, and cast bios.The packaging is nice as the bike and its rider are nicely represented, and the DVDs are  protected in a flip out case. I really didn't have issues with the sound or video like some reviewers did. There was no jumping or skipping and the clarity is just typical of 80's era TV. Could they have remixed the sound and done a better job yes but there are no glaring errors or huge issues.Joe and Rex talk in the interview about creating a ""new"" Street Hawk with updated technology. That is exciting but still nothing can replace the original series which was sadly only cancelled due to network time slot issues not popularity. (And the writers might have to deal with post 90's breakdown of social culture with more flawed characters which might not be so cool.)Five stars for an 80's classic. If you are a fan of Street Hawk, or just love the classic shows from the 80's this is a definite purchase. For newcomers this is definitely worth a look, and the bike still rocks for 27 year old technology.",5,Finally on DVD,1335312000,"04 25, 2012",2012,1602,"['loved', 'watching', '80', 'am', 'glad', 'finally', 'come', 'DVD', 'Long', 'overdue', 'Street', 'Hawk', 'was', 'show', 'less', 'campy', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'classic', 'example', 'more', 'imaginative', 'shows', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'opinion', 'are', 'fair', 'amount', 'extras', 'second', 'DVD', 'interview', 'making', 'Street', 'Hawk', 'two', 'main', 'stars', 'heart', 'throb', 'Rex', 'Smith', 'Joe', 'Regalbuto', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'also', 'production', 'pictures', 'diagrams', 'bike', 'cast', 'bios.The', 'packaging', 'nice', 'bike', 'rider', 'are', 'nicely', 'represented', 'DVDs', 'are', 'protected', 'flip', 'out', 'case', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'issues', 'sound', 'video', 'reviewers', 'did', 'was', 'jumping', 'skipping', 'clarity', 'just', 'typical', '80', 'era', 'TV', 'Could', 'have', 'remixed', 'sound', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'yes', 'are', 'glaring', 'errors', 'huge', 'issues.Joe', 'Rex', 'talk', 'interview', 'creating', 'new', 'Street', 'Hawk', 'updated', 'technology', 'exciting', 'still', 'nothing', 'can', 'replace', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'sadly', 'only', 'cancelled', 'due', 'network', 'time', 'slot', 'issues', 'not', 'popularity', 'writers', 'might', 'have', 'deal', 'post', '90', 'breakdown', 'social', 'culture', 'more', 'flawed', 'characters', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'cool', 'Five', 'stars', '80', 'classic', 'are', 'fan', 'Street', 'Hawk', 'just', 'love', 'classic', 'shows', '80', 'definite', 'purchase', 'newcomers', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'bike', 'still', '27', 'year', 'old', 'technology']",N/A

1336620,AS4XO1MRAEKTQ,B003CNQPNS,Stevie-D,"[1, 2]","Another show from the 80's that was really cool to watch was StreetHawk. This was the only show to really challange Knight Rider. Let's look at the similarities- Jesse Mach was a beat motorcycle cop until a tragic injury got him to work for the government to ride a super-powered motorcyle named ""StreetHawk"" where he and a government desk agent, Norman Tuttle work together. Micheal Long had a tragic near death experience which caused him to change his name (and his face) to Micheal Knight. Micheal is drafted in to work with a agency-like government organization known as FLAG (Foundation for Law And Government)to drive a super-powered sportscar named The Knight Industries Two Thousand (K.I.T.T.)Both solve cases and help people, the only difference is that StreetHawk doesn't talk like KITT and Jesse Mach is the secret identity of StreetHawk. I personally think if StreetHawk stayed on long enough, it would have been a better show than Knight Rider. After a while people would have got tired of watching a talking car. This maybe why the new Knight Rider show of 2008 didn't last long. The T.V. movie was great but the show wasn't as good. On StreetHawk, Norman would use a super-computer to help Jesse ride through traffic and tell him where to go when riding the bike. Just image if that show was on today with the internet and all. The writers of the show may want to think about an updated movie version of StreetHawk. It would be really cool by now with the internet. But due to T.V. politics and Monday Night Football at the time the show only lasted one season. Maybe the real reason StreetHawk got canceled because deep down inside the writers of Knight Rider knew StreetHawk was the only show to challange the popular show back then.",4,Street Hawk; the only show to challange Knight Rider,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,1751,"['show', '80', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'watch', 'was', 'StreetHawk', 'was', 'only', 'show', 'really', 'challange', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'Let', 'look', 'similarities-', 'Jesse', 'Mach', 'was', 'beat', 'motorcycle', 'cop', 'tragic', 'injury', 'got', 'work', 'government', 'ride', 'super-powered', 'motorcyle', 'named', 'StreetHawk', 'where', 'government', 'desk', 'agent', 'Norman', 'Tuttle', 'work', 'together', 'Micheal', 'Long', 'had', 'tragic', 'death', 'experience', 'caused', 'change', 'name', 'face', 'Micheal', 'Knight', 'Micheal', 'drafted', 'work', 'agency-like', 'government', 'organization', 'known', 'FLAG', 'Foundation', 'Law', 'Government', 'drive', 'super-powered', 'sportscar', 'named', 'Knight', 'Industries', 'Two', 'Thousand', 'K.I.T.T', 'solve', 'cases', 'help', 'people', 'only', 'difference', 'StreetHawk', ""n't"", 'talk', 'KITT', 'Jesse', 'Mach', 'secret', 'identity', 'StreetHawk', 'personally', 'think', 'StreetHawk', 'stayed', 'long', 'enough', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'show', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'while', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'got', 'tired', 'watching', 'talking', 'car', 'maybe', 'why', 'new', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'show', '2008', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'T.V', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'StreetHawk', 'Norman', 'would', 'use', 'super-computer', 'help', 'Jesse', 'ride', 'traffic', 'tell', 'where', 'go', 'when', 'riding', 'bike', 'Just', 'image', 'show', 'was', 'today', 'internet', 'writers', 'show', 'may', 'want', 'think', 'updated', 'movie', 'version', 'StreetHawk', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'cool', 'now', 'internet', 'due', 'T.V', 'politics', 'Monday', 'Night', 'Football', 'time', 'show', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'Maybe', 'real', 'reason', 'StreetHawk', 'got', 'canceled', 'because', 'deep', 'down', 'writers', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'knew', 'StreetHawk', 'was', 'only', 'show', 'challange', 'popular', 'show', 'back', 'then']",N/A
1336621,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B003CNQPNS,Taheen Lopez,"[17, 23]","It's about time they finally released this short-lived 13-episode high-tech drama out on DVD about a former motorcycle cop & former amateur dirt-bike racer named Jesse Mach(Rex Smith)who was secretly chosen to test a top-secret project-all terrain attack supercycle capable of speeds up to 300 MPH that even outclassed the Knight 2000 on KNIGHT RIDER after Jesse got injured in the line-of-duty & lost his police partner(Marty)in the process just like Michael Knight(David Hasselhoff)lost his police partner Muncie(Herbert Jefferson, Jr.)in-the-line-of-duty on his last police investigation.Backing the supercycle was a computerized command system that allowed its operator to provide the supercycle's rider with real-time information from various sources & to autopilot the Street Hawk motorcycle during its high-speed runs after clearing traffic along the intended route and had weaponry like AIRWOLF had that KNIGHT RIDER didn't even have either which even made KITT look pale by comparison, especially since KNIGHT RIDER started getting overshadowed by STREET HAWK during its short-run on ABC since KNIGHT RIDER lost a lot of viewers thru STREET HAWK since STREET HAWK stole KNIGHT RIDER's thunder & Jesse stole ""The Man The Machine"" motto away from Michael Knight(David Hasselhoff)among many other things, despite the rumor that STREET HAWK was a rip-off of KNIGHT RIDER.Norman Tuttle(Joe Regalbuto)who was an engineer employed by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration of the Department of Justice, was the designer of the Street Hawk supercycle & reluctantly chose Jesse to test it out which contributed to Jesse living a double-life as a public relations officer from the fictional Metropolitan Police Dept. in L.A. in the daytime & anonymous crime-fighter at night-time kind of like the ornery deputy director Michael Archangel(Alex Cord)provided the reclusive Vietnam veteran Stringfellow Hawke(Jan-Michael Vincent)and his faithful one and only pal since Nam Dominic Santini(Ernest Borgnine)protection in exchange for flying missions of national importance for the FIRM.Additionally, STREET HAWK was originally scheduled to premiere in the Fall of 1984 on Mondays at 8PM, but then ABC had changed their minds when the short-lived Summer series from 1984 CALL TO GLORY did well & STREET HAWK was delayed to mid-season which resulted in STREET HAWK making its debut in the Winter of 1985 at 9PM on Friday nights instead, but then STREET HAWK flopped after only 2 months since it was already apparent that they weren't going to have a 2nd Season underway for the Fall of 1985 since this show wasn't getting the ratings that ABC wanted, despite the fact that STREET HAWK had developed a cult fan base like KNIGHT RIDER and AIRWOLF did since STREET HAWK was an instant smash when it premiered on ABC for the very first time on Friday January 4, 1985 and seemed to be more popular than AIRWOLF and KNIGHT RIDER were, despite the fact that STREET HAWK didn't even last since STREET HAWK hit a speed-bump all of the sudden by the Spring of 1985 since people were perhaps getting bored with watching too much of the same thing every weekend like another reviewer stated about this supercycle series since STREET HAWK was too similar to KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF along with the fact that ABC had STREET HAWK on every Friday night, CBS already had AIRWOLF every Saturday night, and NBC already had KNIGHT RIDER every Sunday night giving people too much competition & redundancy, despite the fact that STREET HAWK had stole KNIGHT RIDER's thunder during this shows brief run along with the fact that the creation of STREET HAWK was inspired by the creation and premiere of both KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF, especially KNIGHT RIDER which also inspired the creation of AIRWOLF.In addition to what helped lead to this shows abrupt cancellation; STREET HAWK's 9PM time-slot on ABC conflicted with DALLAS's 9PM time-slot on CBS every Friday night along with the fact that STREET HAWK premiered too soon after AIRWOLF and KNIGHT RIDER both did too since this show debuted only a year later after AIRWOLF did and 2 1/2 years later after KNIGHT RIDER did since STREET HAWK made its debut on ABC in the Winter of 1985, AIRWOLF made its debut on CBS in the Winter of 1984, and KNIGHT RIDER made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982.Therefore STREET HAWK was outlasted by both AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER and perhaps started overshadowing STREET HAWK and after the ""Murder Is A Novel Idea"" episode of this show was shown on ABC on Thursday March 7, 1985 was a good sign that this show wasn't going in the right direction & that the next episode wasn't going to be shown until 2 months later since STREET HAWK was already cancelled in mid-March of 1985 after only 10 weeks of being on ABC, but then ABC had brought STREET HAWK back on the air temporarily in May of 1985 to finish off STREET HAWKs remaining last 3 episodes of this short-lived series before ABC had cancelled STREET HAWK permanently in the Summer of 1985 when KNIGHT RIDERs 4th Season was underway for the Autumn of 1985 on NBC & while AIRWOLFs 3rd Season was in the works for September of 1985 on CBS which was very similar to what CBS did with THE INCREDIBLE HULK in it's last season after it's 4-year run on CBS since THE INCREDIBLE HULK was cancelled all of the sudden in the middle of the Hulks 5th Season on such short-notice in mid November of 1981 despite its strong ratings, due to budget cuts and a change in management at CBS which contributed to the Hulk's 1981-82 Season being only half a season with only 7 episodes in the can, but CBS had cancelled THE INCREDIBLE HULK after its 5th 1981-1982 Season episode which was the ""Triangle"" episode which original air-date was Friday November 13th, 1982; but then CBS brought the Hulk back on the air temporarily in the Spring of 1982 to finish off its remaining last 2 episodes in May of 1982 which were ""Slaves"" and then ""A Minor Problem"" and then CBS axed THE INCREDIBLE HULK permanently in June of 1982.STREET HAWK was also the bomb on Friday nights in the Winter of 1985 just like KNIGHT RIDER was the bomb on Friday nights from the Fall of 1982 thru the Summer of 1983, especially since STREET HAWK had K.O'd KNIGHT RIDER in the ratings, but on the other hand this show had its share of problems, flaws, & disadvantages too like KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF did since STREET HAWK's rider didn't have total control of the STREET HAWK supercycle as opposed to the Knight 2000 & the Airwolf superchopper since Mach always needed Norman's help in controlling it while on a mission which also makes you wonder how was STREET HAWK able to never accidently hit anything in its way while hitting hyperthrust mode, but unlike Mach, Michael mostly had control of KITT & Hawke mostly had control of AIRWOLF aka ""The Lady"" along with the fact that STREET HAWKs disadvantages were often overlooked & overshadowed by the disadvantages that Airwolf & the Knight 2000 had on top of that, especially since STREET HAWK practically beat KNIGHT RIDER to a pulp.In addition to what made this show an over-the-top smash, STREET HAWK was the hybrid of KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF since STREET HAWK was like a cross between AIRWOLF and KNIGHT RIDER with its supercycle spectacular capabilities that KNIGHT RIDER and AIRWOLF both had & didn't even have, despite the fact that STREET HAWK wasn't as successful or as everlasting as AIRWOLF or KNIGHT RIDER were since STREET HAWK didn't even last since it bit the dust after only 2 months.Overall, I still like KNIGHT RIDER the best out of AIRWOLF, STREET HAWK, and KNIGHT RIDER and I like AIRWOLF the 2nd best out of the following 3 too along with the fact that KNIGHT RIDER was the most successful and longest lasting of those 3 Universal Television high-tech futuristic dramas.STREET HAWK also had some interesting guest stars like*George Clooney in the ""A Second Self"" episode before he was even a star, especially before his co-starring days on E.R.*Bernard White in ""The Adjustor"" episode before his co-starring days as homicide detective(Sgt. Carl Molina) on the short-lived police drama THE NEW DRAGNET*James Whitmore, Jr. in the ""Dog Eat Dog"" episode during his co-starring days as Hunter & McCall's incompetent fellow officer(Det. Bernie Terwilliger)on the police drama HUNTER*Keye Luke in the ""Chinatown Memories"" episode after his co-starring days on KUNG-FU*Joanna Kerns in the ""Hot Target"" episode before her co-starring days as Maggie Seaver on GROWING PAINS*Dennis Franz in the ""Female Of The Species"" episode before his co-starring days as the ornery Det. Andrew Sipowitz on NYPD BLUE & before his co-starring days as Det. Norman Buntz on the police drama HILL STREET BLUES*John Aprea in the ""Follow The Yellow Gold Road"" episode after his co-starring days as Houston's faithful police investigator buddy(Lt. Vince Novelli) on MATT HOUSTON*Belinda Montgomery in the ""Murder Is A Novel Idea"" episode during her co-starring days as Crockett's ex-wife(Caroline)on MIAMI VICEThe bonus feature also tells us about the experience & joys Rex Smith, Jeannie Wilson, & Joe Regalbuto of doing STREET HAWK & how they ran this show by using at least 5 different motorcycles and quite a few stuntmen in Jesse Mach's black STREET HAWK outfit to do the stunts just like they used at least 4 Trans Ams to do the series KNIGHT RIDER since they had to use a stripped down version & model of the STREET HAWK motorcycle for a stuntbike to do the jumps and leaps just like they had to use a stripped down version of the Knight 2000 Trans Am for the stunt cars to do all the impressive stunts on KNIGHT RIDER by using a stripped down version of the '82 Pontiac Trans Am.Additionally, the bonus feature explains how this show ended up being axed even though its ratings seemed high enough to kick off a 2nd Season in the Fall of 1985, but somehow I think STREET HAWK would've ended up lasting longer for at least a 2nd Season if STREET HAWK made its debut in September of 1984 instead of January of 1985 since STREET HAWK was the biggest smash on prime-time since KNIGHT RIDER back then & was an even bigger smash than AIRWOLF was too which reminds me that I think the producers of this show had to give Rex Smith's characters last name as Mach instead of Hawk even though this shows title was STREET HAWK due to the fact that Jan-Michael Vincent already had the last name Hawke for his character on AIRWOLF which debuted the year before STREET HAWK did.Therefore you could say that STREET HAWK was one of the most popular short-lived classic TV shows of all times, at least from the 1980's along with the fact that STREET HAWK was the biggest high-tech phenomenom on TV since KNIGHT RIDER back then.Something else that I noticed about STREET HAWK is even though there was an episode when a deadly laser rifle was used and stolen in which was the ""Hot Target"" episode, this show never had an episode with STREET HAWK being shot at and disarmed by a laser as opposed to the episodes on KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF where Michael(David Hasselhoff)and Hawke(Jan-Michael Vincent)were sent on a mission involving stolen lethal laser rifles like the ""Knight Strike"" & ""Knight & Knerd"" episodes of KNIGHT RIDER and like the ""Annie Oakley"" episode of AIRWOLF which resulted in Airwolf & KITT being temporarily damaged, disabled, short-circuited, and/or weakened leaving the Knight 2000 and Airwolf barely being able to function and solve their missions at the end, but I guess the producers felt that STREET HAWK was worthless battling a laser & would've made Mach(Rex Smith) a lot less protected & a lot more prone to being hit by the laser rifle than Hawke & Michael were which would've resulted in STREET HAWK getting burned or short-circuited & even more damaged than KNIGHT RIDER or AIRWOLF did when they got hit by a laser and/or the producers of STREET HAWK just simply didn't make enough episodes to show an episode like that since this show didn't even last as opposed to KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF.The thing that sucks about this STREET HAWK DVD box set is it doesn't provide any Closed Captioning mode on it to display the subtitles on the screen in case you have difficulty understanding what they say plus this DVD box set doesn't even posts the original air-dates to any of the episodes either, unlike Universal did with KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF & all the other DVD's made by Universal, which I suspect is perhaps due to todays sluggish economy, but I hope somehow that Universal re-releases STREET HAWK on DVD in order to provide the Closed Captioning & subtitles that KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF have on theirs, especially in DVD mode which would be awesome.For instance, the original air-dates & titles to each STREET HAWK episode on ABC were1/4/85-THE PILOT EPISODE1/11/85-A SECOND SELF1/18/85-THE ADJUSTOR1/25/85-VEGAS RUN2/1/85-DOG EAT DOG2/8/85-FIRE ON THE WING2/15/85-CHINATOWN MEMORIES2/22/85-THE UNSINKABLE 4533/1/85-HOT TARGET3/8/85-MURDER IS A NOVEL IDEA5/2/85-THE ARABIAN5/9/85-FEMALE OF THE SPECIES5/16/85-FOLLOW THE YELLOW GOLD ROAD(aka Final Episode)So now that Shout has STREET HAWK in the works to be released on DVD this Summer, I'm hoping to see other classic favorites released on DVD soon like CHiPs-Season 3 and MATT HOUSTON-Season 2.In the meantime, I'm really looking forward to STREET HAWK being released out on DVD on Tuesday July 13th, 2010.",4,Street Hawk Rocks!,1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,13372,"['time', 'finally', 'released', 'short-lived', '13-episode', 'high-tech', 'drama', 'DVD', 'former', 'motorcycle', 'cop', 'former',

1336622,AG4OWT0G254FH,B003CNQPNS,Tom Potter,"[33, 35]","Street Hawk was a show that ran briefly back in 1985 on ABC.  It starred Rex Smith as Jesse Mach, a motorcycle cop who was injured and relegated to a desk job. Joe Regalbuto starred as Norman Tuttle, a government engineer who builds a super-powered motorcycle named ""Street Hawk"".  Each week, Jesse and Norman would take on the evil-doers of the world and make the streets safe for law-abiding citizens.The show's premise comes across to me as a bit of The Lone Ranger being crossed with another popular '80's TV show, Knight Rider. No one knows who the hero is under the mask (or in Street Hawk's case, the helmet) but he rides a computer-enhanced motorcycle replete with futuristic functionality and weaponry.On to my review of the product itself.  Equipment used to view the series was a Sony HDTV, upconverting Toshiba DVD recorder, and 6.1 Sony Home Theater surround sound.I enjoyed re-watching these shows as I hadn't seen them since they last went off the air in 1985 on ABC.  The suspension of dis-belief was still needed, of course, as the show was geared toward a younger audience but still it was fun seeing them again for the first time in 25 years.However, I am docking this DVD release two stars for two big reasons:1) The video presentation was faded and looked awfully washed out.  Yes, I know the show is 25 years old.  By contrast, the commercial DVD releases of TJ Hooker as well as Starsky and Hutch look better on my HDTV than this release did and those shows are older than this one.2) The sound was awfully weak in some of the episodes while decent in others.  I really found myself wishing that Shout! would have taken the time to re-mix the sound into 5.1, as Universal did with their release of Miami Vice.I think cleaning up the video and re-mixing the sound would have added a lot more bite to the release. Considering the amount of dubbed in sounds such as the motorcycle itself, laser & gunfire sounds, etc. it would have enhanced the viewing experience significantly.On the plus side, the new interviews with Rex Smith, Joe Regalbuto and Jeannie Wilson were interesting.  If Mr. Smith happens to read this, I wish him the best of luck in finding one of the bikes from the series to show to his kids.  I've heard there's one overseas in a museum display and there is one that one of the stuntmen from the show restored and is shown riding it on a Youtube video.The DVD case itself is good and sturdy.  Good thinking on Shout!'s part to put in the episode guide so that a viewer can find his or her favorite episodes quickly.  Putting some of the bike's blueprints in the guide was a nice touch.All in all, this was an ok release that I feel could have been done better; however, I am surprised it was released at all considering how short the series run was.  It's too bad that the show didn't last longer as it was a fun ride and an excellent example of '80's escapism at its finest.",3,Fun Show From The '80's,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,2914,"['Street', 'Hawk', 'was', 'show', 'ran', 'back', '1985', 'ABC', 'starred', 'Rex', 'Smith', 'Jesse', 'Mach', 'motorcycle', 'cop', 'who', 'was', 'injured', 'relegated', 'desk', 'job', 'Joe', 'Regalbuto', 'starred', 'Norman', 'Tuttle', 'government', 'engineer', 'who', 'super-powered', 'motorcycle', 'named', 'Street', 'Hawk', 'week', 'Jesse', 'Norman', 'would', 'take', 'evil-doers', 'world', 'make', 'streets', 'safe', 'law-abiding', 'citizens.The', 'show', 'premise', 'bit', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'being', 'crossed', 'popular', ""'80"", 'TV', 'show', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'one', 'who', 'hero', 'mask', 'Street', 'Hawk', 'case', 'helmet', 'computer-enhanced', 'motorcycle', 'replete', 'futuristic', 'functionality', 'weaponry.On', 'review', 'product', 'Equipment', 'used', 'view', 'series', 'was', 'Sony', 'HDTV', 'upconverting', 'Toshiba', 'DVD', 'recorder', '6.1', 'Sony', 'Home', 'Theater', 'surround', 'sound.I', 'enjoyed', 're-watching', 'shows', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'last', 'went', 'air', '1985', 'ABC', 'suspension', 'dis-belief', 'was', 'still', 'needed', 'course', 'show', 'was', 'geared', 'younger', 'audience', 'still', 'was', 'fun', 'seeing', 'again', 'first', 'time', '25', 'years.However', 'am', 'docking', 'DVD', 'release', 'two', 'stars', 'two', 'big', 'reasons:1', 'video', 'presentation', 'was', 'faded', 'looked', 'awfully', 'washed', 'out', 'Yes', 'know', 'show', '25', 'years', 'old', 'contrast', 'commercial', 'DVD', 'releases', 'TJ', 'Hooker', 'as', 'well', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'look', 'better', 'HDTV', 'release', 'did', 'shows', 'are', 'older', 'one.2', 'sound', 'was', 'awfully', 'weak', 'episodes', 'decent', 'others', 'really', 'found', 'wishing', 'Shout', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'time', 're-mix', 'sound', '5.1', 'Universal', 'did', 'release', 'Miami', 'Vice.I', 'think', 'cleaning', 'up', 'video', 're-mixing', 'sound', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'lot', 'more', 'bite', 'release', 'Considering', 'amount', 'dubbed', 'sounds', 'such', 'motorcycle', 'laser', 'gunfire', 'sounds', 'etc', 'would', 'have', 'enhanced', 'viewing', 'experience', 'significantly.On', 'plus', 'side', 'new', 'interviews', 'Rex', 'Smith', 'Joe', 'Regalbuto', 'Jeannie', 'Wilson', 'were', 'interesting', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'read', 'wish', 'best', 'luck', 'finding', 'one', 'bikes', 'series', 'show', 'kids', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'one', 'overseas', 'museum', 'display', 'one', 'one', 'stuntmen', 'show', 'restored', 'shown', 'riding', 'Youtube', 'video.The', 'DVD', 'case', 'good', 'sturdy', 'Good', 'thinking', 'Shout', 'part', 'put', 'episode', 'guide', 'viewer', 'can', 'find', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'quickly', 'Putting', 'bike', 'blueprints', 'guide', 'was', 'nice', 'touch.All', 'was', 'ok', 'release', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'however', 'am', 'surprised', 'was', 'released', 'considering', 'how', 'short', 'series', 'run', 'was', 'too', 'bad', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'longer', 'was', 'fun', 'ride', 'excellent', 'example', ""'80"", 'escapism', 'finest']",N/A
