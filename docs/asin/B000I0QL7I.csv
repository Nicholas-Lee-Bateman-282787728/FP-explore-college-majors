1017761,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000I0QL7I,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","There are some performances that stay with you for years after your initial viewing.  They are so powerful, so lived in and impeccably crafted that they transcend mere acting and being landmarks for the viewer; performances to set all standards to.  I say this in preface of this review because what Vera Farmiga does in `Down to the Bone' is just that; she sets a bar.You can place Farmiga alongside Ashley Judd (for `Bug'), Naomi Watts (for `Mulholland Drive') and Bjork (for `Dancer in the Dark') as one of those Oscar ignored phenomenons.  Her work here topples any and all performances nominated for Oscar in 2005, and her absence from Oscar's shortlist (especially considering the `weak field' perceived by so many prognosticators) is an atrocity.`Down to the Bone', written and directed by `Winter's Bone' director Debra Granik, tells the story of Irene.  Irene is a mother and wife and, above all else, a drug addict.  Struggling to keep her marriage from the rocks while taking care of her two sons, Irene opts for rehab, which is the one place she feels her life may have a shot at finally working.  Once in rehab though, Irene finds that old habits die hard, and new friendships are not always has helpful and advantageous as they initially seem.  Bored within her struggling marriage, Irene begins an affair with fellow `reformed junkie' Bob that only further complicates things for her.  On top of that, Irene still has to contend with her homelife, which offers no support whatsoever.  She is married to a careless man who has no regard for her recovery.  He uses right in front of her, feeding her desire to use and causing rifts in her struggle to stay clean.`Down to the Bone' is just that, a film stripped bare by the haunting realities of addiction.  Long before Farmiga was racking up nominations for her stellar work in 2009's `Up in the Air', she was stealing my attention in this raw and gritty indie.  She pours so much realism into every scene.  The scenes where she is strung out and or completely hung over from a night wasted on binging are so real, so organically lived in, that you feel as if Vera IS Irene.That snake scene alone is flawlessly handled.The sharpness of the script is felt in every scene, and Granik (who perfected her stylistic grit with `Winter's Bone') shades every moment of this film with a raw intensity that is highly commendable.  The film is well-rounded and highlights a earth-wide problem without stumbling into clich&eacute;s and generalizations.  This is one of the most sincere depictions of addiction put to screen in a very long time.",5,Chips away at the bone...,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,2595,"['are', 'performances', 'stay', 'years', 'initial', 'viewing', 'are', 'so', 'powerful', 'so', 'lived', 'impeccably', 'crafted', 'transcend', 'mere', 'acting', 'being', 'landmarks', 'viewer', 'performances', 'set', 'standards', 'say', 'preface', 'review', 'what', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Down', 'Bone', 'just', 'bar.You', 'can', 'place', 'Farmiga', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Bug', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'Bjork', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'one', 'Oscar', 'ignored', 'phenomenons', 'work', 'here', 'performances', 'nominated', 'Oscar', '2005', 'absence', 'Oscar', 'shortlist', 'especially', 'considering', 'weak', 'field', 'perceived', 'so', 'many', 'prognosticators', 'atrocity.', 'Down', 'Bone', 'written', 'directed', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'director', 'Debra', 'Granik', 'story', 'Irene', 'Irene', 'mother', 'wife', 'else', 'drug', 'addict', 'Struggling', 'keep', 'marriage', 'rocks', 'taking', 'care', 'two', 'sons', 'Irene', 'rehab', 'one', 'place', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'shot', 'finally', 'working', 'Once', 'rehab', 'Irene', 'old', 'habits', 'die', 'hard', 'new', 'friendships', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'helpful', 'advantageous', 'initially', 'seem', 'Bored', 'struggling', 'marriage', 'Irene', 'affair', 'fellow', 'reformed', 'junkie', 'Bob', 'only', 'further', 'complicates', 'things', 'top', 'Irene', 'still', 'contend', 'homelife', 'support', 'whatsoever', 'married', 'careless', 'man', 'who', 'regard', 'recovery', 'right', 'front', 'feeding', 'desire', 'use', 'causing', 'rifts', 'struggle', 'stay', 'clean.', 'Down', 'Bone', 'just', 'that', 'film', 'stripped', 'bare', 'haunting', 'realities', 'addiction', 'Long', 'Farmiga', 'was', 'racking', 'up', 'nominations', 'stellar', 'work', '2009', 'Up', 'Air', 'was', 'stealing', 'attention', 'raw', 'gritty', 'indie', 'so', 'much', 'realism', 'scene', 'scenes', 'where', 'strung', 'out', 'completely', 'hung', 'night', 'wasted', 'binging', 'are', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'organically', 'lived', 'feel', 'Vera', 'IS', 'Irene.That', 'snake', 'scene', 'alone', 'flawlessly', 'handled.The', 'sharpness', 'script', 'felt', 'scene', 'Granik', 'who', 'perfected', 'stylistic', 'grit', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'shades', 'moment', 'film', 'raw', 'intensity', 'highly', 'commendable', 'film', 'well-rounded', 'highlights', 'earth-wide', 'problem', 'stumbling', 'clich', 'eacute', 'generalizations', 'one', 'most', 'sincere', 'depictions', 'addiction', 'put', 'screen', 'very', 'long', 'time']",Down to the Bone

1017763,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000I0QL7I,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[23, 24]","Clearly snubbed by Oscar last year, Vera Farmiga delivers a brilliantly controlled performance that warranted an absent Best Actress nomination in this low-budget independent film about a young mother named Irene (Farmiga) who just can't seem to break her bad habits.  Irene is struggling to keep her marriage to fellow junkie Steve (Clint Jordan) afloat while she battles to raise her two sons.  Her drug habit of course makes all of this difficult and so she decides that checking herself into rehab may finally help her to quit for good.Once administered she meets fellow junkies trying to break free, including Lucy (Caridad De La Luz) and Bob (Hugh Dillon), a supposed reformed junkie who takes a liking to Irene from day one.  The two of them start a heated affair that ends badly when they both fall back into using and are eventually arrested for possession, an act that costs Irene her marriage.What makes this film stand out from the rest of the drug and rehabilitation films we see year after year is the authenticity in the performance given by Vera, her complete understanding of what her character is facing at any given moment.  From her remorse filled eyes as she sits across from her counselor to her complete uncertainty as she stares at her husband and her friends using right before her eyes, offering no support to someone they supposedly love.  The environment she's living amidst is part of what breaks her down, herself being the only one determined to change, and it's all but impossible to make those changes on your own.~I just want to mention that one reviewer stated her husband Steve was 'a nice guy' and that's a statement I wholeheartedly disagree with.  The scene I mentioned above alone made me hate him.  As he knows she's trying to clean up he blatantly does drugs in front of her and then offers her them.  He does this on more than one occasion and that alone shows his lack of support for her, an act that is far from a 'nice' thing to do.~The scenes where Irene is drugged and or recovering from the last nights drug binge are so painstakingly real that her acting becomes living.  The scene where her son puts the snake around her neck is so surreal, so much more than acting.  Another actor who must be mentioned and praised is Hugh Dillon who delivers a brilliant performance as Irene's bad influence, a man who at one time helped her change and then within the same breath took it all away.  His own battles with himself are so accurately depicted that you forget to hate him for what he's doing to Irene.There is so much baggage attached with this film, and it handles it so effortlessly that it quickly becomes one of the best films to tackle the subject of addiction and redemption I've ever seen.  With a brilliant script and excellent acting (of course) this film is easily one of my favorite films of 2005.  It slipped under the radar, but I promise you that after you watch this film it won't easily be forgotten, and Vera's performance alone is one for the textbooks.",5,The new face of addiction...,1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,3019,"['Clearly', 'snubbed', 'Oscar', 'last', 'year', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'brilliantly', 'controlled', 'performance', 'warranted', 'absent', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'film', 'young', 'mother', 'named', 'Irene', 'Farmiga', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'break', 'bad', 'habits', 'Irene', 'struggling', 'keep', 'marriage', 'fellow', 'junkie', 'Steve', 'Clint', 'Jordan', 'afloat', 'raise', 'two', 'sons', 'drug', 'habit', 'course', 'difficult', 'so', 'checking', 'rehab', 'may', 'finally', 'help', 'quit', 'good.Once', 'administered', 'fellow', 'junkies', 'trying', 'break', 'free', 'including', 'Lucy', 'Caridad', 'De', 'La', 'Luz', 'Bob', 'Hugh', 'Dillon', 'supposed', 'reformed', 'junkie', 'who', 'liking', 'Irene', 'day', 'one', 'two', 'start', 'heated', 'affair', 'badly', 'when', 'fall', 'back', 'using', 'are', 'eventually', 'arrested', 'possession', 'act', 'Irene', 'marriage.What', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'rest', 'drug', 'rehabilitation', 'films', 'see', 'year', 'year', 'authenticity', 'performance', 'given', 'Vera', 'complete', 'understanding', 'what', 'character', 'facing', 'given', 'moment', 'remorse', 'filled', 'eyes', 'counselor', 'complete', 'uncertainty', 'husband', 'friends', 'using', 'right', 'eyes', 'offering', 'support', 'someone', 'supposedly', 'love', 'environment', 'living', 'amidst', 'part', 'what', 'down', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'determined', 'change', 'impossible', 'make', 'changes', 'own.~I', 'just', 'want', 'mention', 'one', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'husband', 'Steve', 'was', 'nice', 'guy', 'statement', 'wholeheartedly', 'disagree', 'scene', 'mentioned', 'alone', 'made', 'hate', 'trying', 'clean', 'up', 'blatantly', 'drugs', 'front', 'then', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'alone', 'lack', 'support', 'act', 'far', ""'nice"", 'thing', 'do.~The', 'scenes', 'where', 'Irene', 'drugged', 'recovering', 'last', 'nights', 'drug', 'binge', 'are', 'so', 'painstakingly', 'real', 'acting', 'becomes', 'living', 'scene', 'where', 'son', 'snake', 'neck', 'so', 'surreal', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'acting', 'actor', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'mentioned', 'praised', 'Hugh', 'Dillon', 'who', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Irene', 'bad', 'influence', 'man', 'who', 'one', 'time', 'helped', 'change', 'then', 'same', 'breath', 'took', 'away', 'own', 'battles', 'are', 'so', 'accurately', 'depicted', 'forget', 'hate', 'what', 'doing', 'Irene.There', 'so', 'much', 'baggage', 'attached', 'film', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'quickly', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'tackle', 'subject', 'addiction', 'redemption', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'brilliant', 'script', 'excellent', 'acting', 'course', 'film', 'easily', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', '2005', 'slipped', 'radar', 'promise', 'watch', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'easily', 'be', 'forgotten', 'Vera', 'performance', 'alone', 'one', 'textbooks']",Down to the Bone

Irene is a survivor of sorts who is easy to admire.

But she leaves rehab early, spends her kid's birthday check on crack, and leaves her dead beat husband for a recovering addict named Bob. Their emerging love devolves into relapse, co-dependence, and new spasms of self-destructive choices. Writer-director Debra Granik also won a Sundance Director's Award for this film.

1017766,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,B000I0QL7I,dv_forever,"[0, 1]","There are so many glossy, sensationalistic, exploitative movies about drug addiction out there. Requiem for a Dream, anyone? No, a person's real life drug habits do not pulse to the beat of the Knonos Quartet! Get a clue, Aronofsky!Here on the other hand, we have a gritty, greasy, grimy portrayal of a working mom struggling first with cocaine and then experimenting with heroin. The film was shot on digital cameras that are a step below the pros and it has that documentary look and feel that will be offputting to people weaned on the classy Hollywood movie look. I don't particularly feel that digital must be done to achieve a gritty atmosphere but if budgeting reasons were the motivator behind this, then it's ok.Vera Farmiga goes through a rollercoaster of emotions as she fights her nagging dependancy on narcotics. The movie is most realistic in the way that just when you think that you've beaten the problem, it returns over and over again into your life, like some malignant recurring cancer. Misery loves company and drug addicts certainly enjoy the company of people who enable them in their lifestyles. Unhappy in her crumbling marriage, he begins seeing some new guy, someone who seems to have beaten his own problem. One thing leads to another and then heroin comes into both their lives. One thing I liked about the film is that essentially these people are not raving lunatics or thieves, they are mostly functioning in their day to day lives while at the same suffering from these chains around their necks. Life is already filled with misery and agony, when a person runs to the comfort of drugs to deal with the pain, watch out!Debra Granik is a director making a name for herself. All her work so far has been gritty portraits of poverty under the heel of some drug-addled atmosphere. Her latest film is the highly acclaimed ""Winter's Bone"", which has just recently been nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award. How's that for coming up in the world? I even saw her 16mm short film contained on this DVD, that she expanded into Down to the Bone. All effective work.

1017767,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000I0QL7I,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","Having been intrigued by Vera Farmiga's idiosyncratic turn as a confused police psychologist in Martin Scorsese's viscerally impressive ""The Departed"", I was curious to see her in this critically acclaimed low-budget 2005 indie. As it turns out, she gives a startling, soul-bearing performance as Irene, a working class wife and mother with a cocaine dependency problem. The primary difference between this film and more conventionally moralizing addiction movies is how her drug-taking habit has so casually permeated her life. As a result, the story simply feels more honest by eschewing the standard melodrama.Written (with Richard Lieske) and directed by first-timer Debra Granik, the film provides a documentary-like feel for Irene's downtrodden existence in New York's blue-collar-dominated Ulster County as a supermarket cashier, who has been likely a stoner for most of her adult life. Cut off by her drug dealer for falling behind on her payments, she pilfers one of her children's birthday checks and realizes the depths she has plumbed. Checking herself into rehab, Irene looks like she is on the road to recovery, but she is hamstrung by an affair that starts with Bob, a male nurse recovered from his own addiction. Compounded by her firing from the market and a husband who continues to enable her, she finds herself in a vicious circle of entangled dependency and dwindling hope.The movie gets choppy and unnecessarily elliptical at times, although it is not as desultory as one would expect from the set-up. Don't expect any bravura set pieces for Farmiga, who is in almost every scene. It is the utter sense of emotional desolation she conveys in the small moments that resonates. Even when she shows how much she cares for her two sons or has moments of hope about a brighter future, there is a lingering melancholy that haunts all her scenes. Though clearly overshadowed, Hugh Dillon is quite good as Bob, as is Clint Jordan as husband Steve. I was surprised to find out from the informative commentary track by Granik and Farmiga that many of the supporting players were local non-actors. The 2006 DVD also includes the primitive but still impressive 1997 twenty-minute short, ""Snake Feed"", upon which the film is based.",4,"Farmiga Soars in a Low-Budget Study of an Emotionally Desolate, Cocaine-Addicted Wife and Mother",1162252800,"10 31, 2006",2006,2240,"['Having', 'been', 'intrigued', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'idiosyncratic', 'turn', 'confused', 'police', 'psychologist', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'viscerally', 'impressive', 'Departed', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'low-budget', '2005', 'indie', 'out', 'startling', 'soul-bearing', 'performance', 'Irene', 'working', 'class', 'wife', 'mother', 'cocaine', 'dependency', 'problem', 'primary', 'difference', 'film', 'more', 'conventionally', 'moralizing', 'addiction', 'movies', 'how', 'drug-taking', 'habit', 'so', 'casually', 'permeated', 'life', 'result', 'story', 'simply', 'more', 'honest', 'eschewing', 'standard', 'melodrama.Written', 'Richard', 'Lieske', 'directed', 'first-timer', 'Debra', 'Granik', 'film', 'documentary-like', 'feel', 'Irene', 'downtrodden', 'existence', 'New', 'York', 'blue-collar-dominated', 'Ulster', 'County', 'supermarket', 'cashier', 'who', 'been', 'likely', 'stoner', 'most', 'adult', 'life', 'Cut', 'off', 'drug', 'dealer', 'falling', 'behind', 'payments', 'one', 'children', 'birthday', 'checks', 'depths', 'plumbed', 'Checking', 'rehab', 'Irene', 'road', 'recovery', 'hamstrung', 'affair', 'Bob', 'male', 'nurse', 'recovered', 'own', 'addiction', 'Compounded', 'firing', 'market', 'husband', 'who', 'enable', 'vicious', 'circle', 'entangled', 'dependency', 'dwindling', 'hope.The', 'movie', 'choppy', 'unnecessarily', 'elliptical', 'times', 'not', 'as', 'desultory', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'set-up', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'bravura', 'set', 'pieces', 'Farmiga', 'who', 'almost', 'scene', 'utter', 'sense', 'emotional', 'desolation', 'small', 'moments', 'Even', 'when', 'how', 'much', 'two', 'sons', 'moments', 'hope', 'brighter', 'future', 'lingering', 'melancholy', 'scenes', 'clearly', 'overshadowed', 'Hugh', 'Dillon', 'quite', 'good', 'Bob', 'Clint', 'Jordan', 'husband', 'Steve', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'Granik', 'Farmiga', 'many', 'supporting', 'players', 'were', 'local', 'non-actors', '2006', 'DVD', 'also', 'primitive', 'still', 'impressive', '1997', 'twenty-minute', 'short', 'Snake', 'Feed', 'film', 'based']",Down to the Bone

Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[1, 1]","I grew up on the independent movies of the 90's, and there's no doubt that nowadays, the ""indie"" movies are glossier and more hollywood-like than they were 10 or 15 years ago.  Down To The Bone is a great, gritty, no frills story that takes hermetic focus on Irene, played by Vera Formiga, the small town upstate NY mother of two who's secretly addicted to cocaine.  At rehab, a counselor sounds shocked that she could have experienced debilitating addiction but not threatened her children or lost her job, but for Irene, her problem has gestated since High School and has slowly taken over her life.  What happens then is a brilliant, occasionally gut shattering take on the long, day to day process that is recovery - Irene realizing she's no longer as quick at her grocery clerk job, falling for Bob (Hugh Dillon), a sweet recovering addict who's become an ex-nurse, sitting through painful meetings and probation hearings.  Formiga's work is fearless and unguarded, a more unvarnished version of Maggie Gyllenhaal in Sherrybaby - Formiga's Irene feels like anyone you remember from your small town high school, somewhere further into her difficult life.  The choices she makes are true to addicts, true to the credo that things get worse before they get better, and the movie grips us most when Irene makes truly awful decisions - because our disappointment is truly hers as well.  Director Debra Granik has a great DV authenticity - from the great small town details of addiction (the smell of window cleaner makes Irene nostalgic), to surprisingly symbolic shots of a pet snake - and it's that authenticity that gives the movie's astonishing, simple conclusion so powerful, a reaffirmation of life as much as a statement of addiction.",5,True independent filmmaking,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,1741,"['grew', 'up', 'independent', 'movies', '90', 'doubt', 'indie', 'movies', 'are', 'glossier', 'more', 'hollywood-like', 'were', '10', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'Down', 'Bone', 'great', 'gritty', 'frills', 'story', 'hermetic', 'focus', 'Irene', 'played', 'Vera', 'Formiga', 'small', 'town', 'upstate', 'NY', 'mother', 'two', 'who', 'secretly', 'addicted', 'cocaine', 'rehab', 'counselor', 'shocked', 'could', 'have', 'experienced', 'debilitating', 'addiction', 'not', 'threatened', 'children', 'lost', 'job', 'Irene', 'problem', 'gestated', 'High', 'School', 'slowly', 'taken', 'over', 'life', 'What', 'then', 'brilliant', 'occasionally', 'gut', 'shattering', 'take', 'long', 'day', 'day', 'process', 'recovery', 'Irene', 'realizing', 'no', 'longer', 'quick', 'grocery', 'clerk', 'job', 'falling', 'Bob', 'Hugh', 'Dillon', 'sweet', 'recovering', 'addict', 'who', 'become', 'ex-nurse', 'sitting', 'painful', 'meetings', 'probation', 'hearings', 'Formiga', 'work', 'fearless', 'unguarded', 'more', 'unvarnished', 'version', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Sherrybaby', 'Formiga', 'Irene', 'feels', 'anyone', 'remember', 'small', 'town', 'high', 'school', 'somewhere', 'further', 'difficult', 'life', 'choices', 'are', 'true', 'addicts', 'true', 'credo', 'things', 'get', 'worse', 'get', 'better', 'movie', 'most', 'when', 'Irene', 'truly', 'awful', 'decisions', 'disappointment', 'truly', 'hers', 'as', 'well', 'Director', 'Debra', 'Granik', 'great', 'DV', 'authenticity', 'great', 'small', 'town', 'details', 'addiction', 'smell', 'window', 'cleaner', 'Irene', 'nostalgic', 'surprisingly', 'symbolic', 'shots', 'pet', 'snake', 'authenticity', 'movie', 'astonishing', 'simple', 'conclusion', 'so', 'powerful', 'reaffirmation', 'life', 'as', 'much', 'statement', 'addiction']",Down to the Bone

Sometimes, a lot of the time I'm betting, it's people like the woman portrayed in this film.  She's just trying to make a life for herself and take care of her kids.  She goes to work, cooks dinner, etc. and believes for a long time that it's all under control.  Until it isn't.  She ends up in a rehab center for a couple of weeks and then tries going straight with the help of a 12 Step Program.  Things get more complicated when she begins an affair with a man she meets in rehab.  This is one of the most honest depictions of addiction that I have ever seen on film. Looking in the haunted eyes of the people in the rehab center, especially the lead actress, tells you their whole story without saying a word.  I had a relative who died of an overdose about 6 months ago and her eyes took on that same sad, sunken and hopeless look in her last few months.

1017770,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000I0QL7I,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Director Debra Granik knows how to tell a story in such a subtle way that even when the topic is drug addiction she allows her characters to be three-dimensional people instead of the usual stereotypes that conflict the emotional impact of such films.Irene (Vera Farmiga, an intensely talented young actress) is the mother of two sweet boys Ben (Jasper Daniels) and Jason (Taylor Foxhall) and is married to a nice guy Steve (Clint Jordan) who plays with drugs but is in no way as addicted as Irene is to cocaine.  The story takes us through Irene's addiction, her committing herself to a drug rehab program where she meets Lucy (Caridad 'La Bruja' De La Luz), also kicking her habit, and male nurse Bob (Hugh Dillon) who has been clean from heroin addiction for five years.  Irene leaves the rehab too early (she is mostly concerned about the welfare of her children and her job) and when she starts back to work as a grocery checker she is dismissed when she confesses to prior drug use: being 'clean' makes her slower at the check out stand!  She partners with Lucy cleaning homes, trying to straighten out her life, but falls in love with Bob and together they have an affair and start using again.  Rather than end the story the writers (Debra Granik and Richard Lieske) simply allow the story to remain open ended, much the way the daily lives of those struggling with the demon of drug addiction live.  This technique of unresolved relationships is immensely powerful.The performance by Farmiga establishes her as one of our truly important actresses.  She gives us a credible human being who is out of focus with the world because of her drug use, but despite some borderline behavior patterns she maintains our compassion.  The remainder of the cast is superb.  The icy cinematography by Michael McDonough  and the superb film editing by Malcolm Jamieson  deserve applause.  This is a powerful little film that provides more understanding of the psyches of those struggling to live both with addiction and after addiction.  Highly recommended.

It's hard to imagine someone coming up with a new angle--there is addiction leading to destruction and addiction leading to rehabilitation.  In either case, the addiction drama can be very alluring to the ""serious"" actor.  What a great opportunity to showcase your acting chops--emotional devastation, a life spiraling out of control.  Just think of all the actors who have received accolades (and deservedly so, for the most part) for exposing this unseemly underbelly of the human existence.  What is a refreshing surprise about both ""Down To The Bone"" and Vera Farmiga's performance are how natural, straightforward, and understated they are.Farmiga plays Irene, a wife and mother of two.  A functional addict with a job as a supermarket checker, Irene realizes that her addiction is compromising a normal childhood for her children.  Even though her husband is also a user, Irene takes steps to clean up her life when she hits a low point by stealing her daughter's birthday check to try and score a fix.  The film documents her progress through a rehab program and the subsequent outpatient meetings as she attempts a drug free life.  These scenes are played with a simplicity and earnestness.  They are very naturalistic and the others involved play as real people instead of character types.  There is no emotional grandstanding, just real individuals trying to get a grip on life--however fleeting that control may be.  Connecting with a male nurse (and former heroin addict) at the rehab facility, Hugh Dillon in a great performance, Irene sees a success story and perhaps a chance at a clean life.Not everything is easy on the outside, though, it never is.  Struggling with her job (she loses efficiency when she's not stoned), a non-supportive husband, and a potential new love interest--Irene's life is a complicated as ever.  But she must make changes in order to survive and succeed.  Through it all, the subtlety of Farmiga's performance keeps you invested in her story.  Not a hero, not a villain--she's a messed-up protagonist who makes mistakes.  Farmiga doesn't need big moments to convey the complexity of Irene, and this is surely the performance of a major talent.Director Debra Granik has made a stunningly simple film about a very difficult topic.  By allowing Farmiga to develop Irene as a real person and peel away vanity and ""staginess,"" ""Down to the Bone"" emerges as a sincere, relevant, and understated examination of the functioning addict.  I look forward to seeing more work from Granik and Farmiga (who got a big role in ""The Departed"" after this film that only showcases a fraction of her apparent talent).

I happen to like movies about pain because I get to go on the inside and see what people are really feeling.  Usually, in the course of our daily lives, we just get to see the rather bland exteriors that people are willing to show us.  We don't get much insight on what's really going on with them.  A film like ""Down To The Bone"" provides the viewer a sharp, piercing intimacy.  The viewer becomes the close personal friend of the main characters because they share everything with us.  I really like that.Of course, the acting and the writing in a film like this has to be first-rate in order to sustain the illusion that we are entering into the lives of these characters.  Luckily, everything about this movie achieves genuine artistic success.  The movie sucks us into the lives of some rather desperate, unhappy people and we are glad to be along for the ride.Despite the downbeat nature of this story, there are some signs of hope by the end.  We won't want to slit our wrists at the conclusion of the film because we won't be depressed to the point of absolute despair.  We might even feel a little better about ourselves.

1017779,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B000I0QL7I,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","Before Debra Granik gave us the acclaimed and personal favorite ""Winter's Bone"" last year, she released this her first film.  It made less than $20 thousand in the U. S.  Still, it has been recognized by many critics and managed to win a Sundance and an Independent Spirit Award.  Set in upstate New York (although I swear I saw an Interstate 75 highway sign), the film is about drug addiction in a small town.  This really isn't anything new and I'm not sure why this film had to be made.  It is directed and shot more like a documentary than a drama, although drama is aplenty.  The story reminds me in many respects, of the current TV series ""Nurse Jackie"".  We have an otherwise dedicated mother of 2 children, both boys, working as a grocery cashier in this blue collar, bleak town.  She lives in a ramshackle house on the edge of town with her husband.  He loves his beer and marijuana.  She loves her cocaine.  Irene (Vera Farmiga) decides to get clean and meets a nurse at the addiction clinic.  Nurse Bob (Hugh Dillon) is also a former addict.  They like each other and go to the city for a week-end where they both get hooked again.  Blah, blah, blah.  You get the picture.  I was not impressed by the story or the filmmaking, although that certainly puts me in the minority...at least with critics.  What I was impressed with was Vera Farmiga.  In what was a breakout performance she is totally believable in this role.  She is amazing to watch as she transforms from loving mother to desperate drug addict.

It does show how addict parents can squeak by at work and home until they hit the meat grinder of recovery.  It also shows how a woman and man who begin a torrid romance in N.A. meetings inevitably use drugs again...soon.  My big gripe is that they seem too lethargic.

1017783,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000I0QL7I,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Down to the Bone (Debra Granik, 2004)I watched Winter's Bone earlier this week and was wowed by it, so I immediately went back and queued up Down to the Bone, Granik's first feature. Bonus points: it stars the wonderful Vera Farmiga (Orphan). I've seen some mediocre movies featuring Vera Farmiga, but I've never seen her turn in a mediocre performance. Unfortunately, this is one of those times when she really stands out in a piece; this is an extension of Granik's 1997 short Snake Feed, and it shows.Plot: Irene (Farmiga) is living below the poverty line in a crappy little town in the middle of nowhere, trying to support two kids and a secret coke habit on her salary working as a cashier at a local grocery store (one of the movie's running jokes: ""Do you have an advantage card?"" ""No."" ""Eh, I don't either...""). After a desperate night trying to use her kid's birthday check in order to buy cocaine, she realizes she's out of control and checks herself into rehab, where she meets Bob (Hard Core Logo's High Dillon), a nurse and ex-addict she'd previously run into at a Halloween party. Thanks to a lot of therapy and (in no small part) Bob's support, she manages to get clean--but when she gets out again, the pressures of daily life are always urging her back.It's a very, very well-kept secret in today's society that a lot of addicts, no matter what their drug of choice, are functioning members of society; the late Peter McWilliams, in his book Ain't Nobody's Business if You Do, cites an estimate that just six percent of addicts are of the non-functional variety painted large across the media we consume every day. And I applaud Granik for understanding this and building Irene and her husband Steve (The Motel's Clint Jordan), as functional a pair of addicts as you are likely to ever see in the media. The problem is that movies that depict functional members of society are, well, kind of boring; that's a big part of the reason that movies depicting non-functional addicts have been box office manna from heaven ever since The Man with the Golden Arm. We spend a lot of time getting to know Irene and her family, and, well, some of it is time well spent, but a lot of it is Granik building the routine, showing us the idea that Irene is functional, and dammit, as much as I love that this exists, I'm not all that hot to watch it again, you know? The second half of the movie picks up (though trying to be as non-spoilery as possible, I hate why it picks up, and I hate myself a little for liking that it picked up, even given the reason it did), and ultimately, I think that does make it worth watching. But as I said at the top of the hour, this is a feature-length extension of a short; the seams show a little too much to make it as good as it could have been, and given Winter's Bone, we know it could have been very good indeed. ***",3,Winter Is Coming.,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,2859,"['Down', 'Bone', 'Debra', 'Granik', '2004', 'watched', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'earlier', 'week', 'was', 'wowed', 'so', 'immediately', 'went', 'back', 'queued', 'up', 'Down', 'Bone', 'Granik', 'first', 'feature', 'points', 'wonderful', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Orphan', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'mediocre', 'movies', 'featuring', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'turn', 'mediocre', 'performance', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'times', 'when', 'really', 'out', 'piece', 'extension', 'Granik', '1997', 'short', 'Snake', 'Feed', 'shows.Plot', 'Irene', 'Farmiga', 'living', 'poverty', 'line', 'crappy', 'little', 'town', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'trying', 'support', 'two', 'kids', 'secret', 'coke', 'habit', 'salary', 'working', 'cashier', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'one', 'movie', 'running', 'jokes', 'Do', 'have', 'advantage', 'card', 'Eh', 'do', ""n't"", 'either', 'desperate', 'night', 'trying', 'use', 'kid', 'birthday', 'check', 'order', 'buy', 'cocaine', 'control', 'checks', 'rehab', 'where', 'Bob', 'Hard', 'Core', 'Logo', 'High', 'Dillon', 'nurse', 'ex-addict', ""'d"", 'previously', 'run', 'Halloween', 'party', 'Thanks', 'lot', 'therapy', 'small', 'part', 'Bob', 'support', 'get', 'clean', 'when', 'out', 'again', 'pressures', 'daily', 'life', 'are', 'always', 'urging', 'back.It', 'very', 'very', 'well-kept', 'secret', 'today', 'society', 'lot', 'addicts', 'matter', 'what', 'drug', 'choice', 'are', 'functioning', 'members', 'society', 'late', 'Peter', 'McWilliams', 'book', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Nobody', 'Business', 'Do', 'estimate', 'just', 'six', 'percent', 'addicts', 'are', 'non-functional', 'variety', 'painted', 'large', 'media', 'consume', 'day', 'applaud', 'Granik', 'understanding', 'building', 'Irene', 'husband', 'Steve', 'Motel', 'Clint', 'Jordan', 'functional', 'pair', 'addicts', 'are', 'likely', 'ever', 'see', 'media', 'problem', 'movies', 'depict', 'functional', 'members', 'society', 'are', 'well', 'kind', 'boring', 'big', 'part', 'reason', 'movies', 'depicting', 'non-functional', 'addicts', 'have', 'been', 'box', 'office', 'manna', 'heaven', 'ever', 'Man', 'Golden', 'Arm', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'getting', 'know', 'Irene', 'family', 'well', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'lot', 'Granik', 'building', 'routine', 'showing', 'idea', 'Irene', 'functional', 'dammit', 'as', 'much', 'love', ""'m"", 'not', 'hot', 'watch', 'again', 'know', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'up', 'trying', 'be', 'as', 'non-spoilery', 'possible', 'hate', 'why', 'up', 'hate', 'little', 'liking', 'picked', 'up', 'even', 'given', 'reason', 'did', 'ultimately', 'think', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'said', 'top', 'hour', 'feature-length', 'extension', 'short', 'seams', 'show', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'make', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'know', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', '***']",Down to the Bone

Set in the dreary months of winter and shot in Kingston, New York, it portrays the life of a very real desperate housewife with a blue-collar husband and two kids, a job as a cashier at a supermarket, and a drug habit. The film follows her attempts to get clean and sober without the usual melodrama of films in this genre, just the day-to-day struggle of dealing with a difficult life within constant earshot of addiction's siren call.Vera Farmiga gives an amazing, controlled performance as the central character in the film, who loses both job and husband as she takes up with a male nurse at a rehab facility. Struggling with his own addiction, he jeopardizes her recovery, and the cycle of drug dependence continues. The film develops dramatic intensity without the use of histrionics. Voices are rarely raised and physical movement is restrained, yet emotions crackle under the surface of most scenes. The presence of two totally plausible child actors in several scenes adds a dimension of vulnerability while avoiding sentimentality.The DVD includes a short film, ""Snake Feed,"" on which the feature film was based, plus a commentary by the director, Debra Granik, and actress Farmiga.",5,One day at a time . . .,1164931200,"12 1, 2006",2006,1243,"['not', 'usual', 'story', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Set', 'dreary', 'months', 'winter', 'shot', 'Kingston', 'New', 'York', 'life', 'very', 'real', 'desperate', 'housewife', 'blue-collar', 'husband', 'two', 'kids', 'job', 'cashier', 'supermarket', 'drug', 'habit', 'film', 'attempts', 'get', 'clean', 'sober', 'usual', 'melodrama', 'films', 'genre', 'just', 'day-to-day', 'struggle', 'dealing', 'difficult', 'life', 'constant', 'earshot', 'addiction', 'siren', 'call.Vera', 'Farmiga', 'amazing', 'controlled', 'performance', 'central', 'character', 'film', 'who', 'job', 'husband', 'up', 'male', 'nurse', 'rehab', 'facility', 'Struggling', 'own', 'addiction', 'recovery', 'cycle', 'drug', 'dependence', 'film', 'dramatic', 'intensity', 'use', 'histrionics', 'Voices', 'are', 'rarely', 'raised', 'physical', 'movement', 'restrained', 'emotions', 'crackle', 'surface', 'most', 'scenes', 'presence', 'two', 'totally', 'plausible', 'child', 'actors', 'several', 'scenes', 'dimension', 'vulnerability', 'avoiding', 'sentimentality.The', 'DVD', 'short', 'film', 'Snake', 'Feed', 'feature', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'commentary', 'director', 'Debra', 'Granik', 'actress', 'Farmiga']",Down to the Bone
