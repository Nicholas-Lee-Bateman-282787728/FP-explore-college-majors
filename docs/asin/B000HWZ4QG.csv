1017354,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B000HWZ4QG,Mel Odom,"[9, 9]","AIR BUDDIES is another take on the longstanding Air Bud franchise Disney DVD has pumped over over the last few years.  Air Bud was a dog (a Golden Retriever, no less) that could play baseball, soccer, football, volleyball, and basketball.  It only stands to reason that his offspring would be simply amazing as well.  This DVD tells their stories, and there are a lot of laughs along the way.Patrick Cranshaw and Don Knotts were two of Hollywood's finest character actors, and they were good in this film.  They were joined by Richard Karn and Cynthia Stevenson, also veteran character actors and second bananas in top-rated shows like HOME IMPROVEMENT and DEAD LIKE ME.The movie starts out with a bang, bringing the viewers into Air Bud's life as a dad with five incorrigable puppies that share his love of sports and his ability.  However, the puppies are too much for the family, as shown when they gang up on the nanny and tie her up.  At the same time, a villain sets his sights on their famous father, intending to bag Air Bud and sell him to a millionaire's spoiled son.  When the puppies run away from home to escape being separated and given away, they're used by the bad guys as bait.  Then, when their parents are dognapped, it's up to the puppies to save the day.The humor is great, definitely jokes and physical comedy that keeps the younger viewers in stitches while providing an entertaining romp for the adults in the crowd.  This is one of those DVDs to buy for road trips in the family van because kids will want to watch this one over and over.",4,Surefire Winner For Kids,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,1563,"['AIR', 'BUDDIES', 'take', 'longstanding', 'Air', 'Bud', 'franchise', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'pumped', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Air', 'Bud', 'was', 'dog', 'Golden', 'Retriever', 'less', 'could', 'play', 'baseball', 'soccer', 'football', 'volleyball', 'basketball', 'only', 'reason', 'offspring', 'would', 'be', 'simply', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'DVD', 'stories', 'are', 'lot', 'laughs', 'way.Patrick', 'Cranshaw', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'were', 'two', 'Hollywood', 'finest', 'character', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'film', 'were', 'joined', 'Richard', 'Karn', 'Cynthia', 'Stevenson', 'also', 'veteran', 'character', 'actors', 'second', 'bananas', 'top-rated', 'shows', 'HOME', 'IMPROVEMENT', 'DEAD', 'LIKE', 'ME.The', 'movie', 'out', 'bang', 'bringing', 'viewers', 'Air', 'Bud', 'life', 'dad', 'five', 'incorrigable', 'puppies', 'share', 'love', 'sports', 'ability', 'However', 'puppies', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'family', 'shown', 'when', 'gang', 'up', 'nanny', 'tie', 'up', 'same', 'time', 'villain', 'sights', 'famous', 'father', 'intending', 'bag', 'Air', 'Bud', 'sell', 'millionaire', 'spoiled', 'son', 'When', 'puppies', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'escape', 'being', 'separated', 'given', 'away', ""'re"", 'used', 'bad', 'guys', 'bait', 'Then', 'when', 'parents', 'are', 'dognapped', 'up', 'puppies', 'save', 'day.The', 'humor', 'great', 'definitely', 'jokes', 'physical', 'comedy', 'younger', 'viewers', 'stitches', 'providing', 'entertaining', 'romp', 'adults', 'crowd', 'one', 'DVDs', 'buy', 'road', 'trips', 'family', 'van', 'kids', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'one', 'over', 'over']",Air Buddies
