It wasn't awkward at all, which I kind of thought it might be, and I really enjoyed it.The musical aspect of the show definitely dies down after the longer opening numbers are through and then it's for the most part just a normal Psych episode with occasional shorter numbers that blend well with the scene.I do hope this season they remembered that the charm of the show was based on Shawn and Gus and NOT Shawn and Juliette, or Gus and his girl, or Lassiter and his. The other characters are meaningless to me except for something for Shawn and Gus to work off of. The character of Henry is the only one that is more than a mere compliment to the pair and he could even successfully make it a trio but not any of the others. They could be replaced and the character of the show still remain so attempting not only some ensemble cast, but even worse a cast of a bunch of boyfriends and girlfriends, weakened the show. I hope for this last season they go back to what worked so well.",4,Could have done without the musical but it was well done and entertaining.,1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,1130,"['rarely', 'musicals', 'used', 'format', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'something', 'other', 'Psych', 'worked', 'worked', 'pretty', 'good', 'actually', 'was', ""n't"", 'awkward', 'kind', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'it.The', 'musical', 'aspect', 'show', 'definitely', 'down', 'longer', 'opening', 'numbers', 'are', 'then', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'normal', 'Psych', 'episode', 'occasional', 'shorter', 'numbers', 'blend', 'well', 'scene.I', 'do', 'hope', 'season', 'remembered', 'charm', 'show', 'was', 'based', 'Shawn', 'Gus', 'NOT', 'Shawn', 'Juliette', 'Gus', 'girl', 'Lassiter', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'meaningless', 'something', 'Shawn', 'Gus', 'work', 'off', 'character', 'Henry', 'only', 'one', 'more', 'mere', 'compliment', 'pair', 'could', 'even', 'successfully', 'make', 'trio', 'not', 'others', 'could', 'be', 'replaced', 'character', 'show', 'still', 'remain', 'so', 'attempting', 'not', 'only', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'even', 'worse', 'cast', 'bunch', 'boyfriends', 'girlfriends', 'weakened', 'show', 'hope', 'last', 'season', 'go', 'back', 'what', 'worked', 'so', 'well']",Psych: The Musical
