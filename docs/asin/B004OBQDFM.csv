1422924,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B004OBQDFM,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[1, 1]","For those of you who don't know this, this is the first part of the ""Chronicles of Narnia."" There are 7 books in all. (1) ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" (2) ""Prince Caspian,"" (3) ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"" (4) ""The Silver Chair,"" (5) ""The Horse and His Boy,"" (6) ""The Magician's Nephew,"" and (7) ""The Last Battle.""  (Though so far, only the first 4 books have been made into movies.)To appreciate this story the most, we have to keep in mind that C.S. Lewis was an atheist who eventually converted to Anglicanism. (Anglo Catholicism if you prefer)The story starts with the 4 Pevensie children. (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) The youngest one (Lucy) claims to have gone through the wardrobe, which leads to the land of Narnia, where an evil queen makes certain that it is always winter there and never Christmas. None of the other 3 children believe Lucy, but Edmund is especially rude. However, Lucy holds to her beliefs. Later Edmund finds this to be true, and runs across the evil queen. Perhaps out of feeling picked on, Edmund develops a liking for her.(It's worth noting that she has some political charm, and is even somewhat funny in this first encounter with Edmund.)Edmund later runs into Lucy there who is now convinced Edmund will back up her story to Peter and Susan. But in an especially vile moment, he flat out denies it.Eventually, all the children end up in Narnia, and Edmund is caught in his vile lie.  The 4 children soon run across Mr. and Mrs. Beaver who explain to the children that there is an evil queen there who keeps Christmas out of Narnia. But there is hope. The noble lion Aslan  (who is obviously suppose to represent Jesus is coming). We may wonder if Mr. and Mrs. Beaver represent C.S. Lewis and his wife.Perhaps moved by misplaced compassion, Edmund defects to the queen and betrays his brother and sisters only to find out that the queen is truly the evil one in Narnia. Up until now, Edmund has been vile and repulsive. But the start of his redemption is convincing when he pleads for the lives of the animals in the forest having a picnic, just as the evil queen turns them to stone.The other 3 children and Mr. and Mrs. Beaver make it to Aslan. And things start to look good as Peter starts to fight off the evil queen's forces. The penitent Edmund is even rescued, and clearly wants to cast off his past ways.However, there is a problem. The queen is entitled to a kill. And Aslan (to save Edmund) must walk the sorrowful steps of Good Friday. WARNING: The Good Friday scene where Aslan sacrifices himself is surprisingly graphic, and parents may wish to screen it before they show it to children.However, the sorrowful events of Good Friday are soon followed by the glorious events of Easter Sunday. And Aslan's return is nothing short of glorious. To top it off, Edmund (now redeemed) shows extreme and admirable courage  when at the crucial moment, he risks himself to destroy the evil queen's power.On a side note, we need not be surprised that in later books, Edmund maintains his heroic and redeemed self. Furthermore, when a once obnoxious, but later penitent Eustace comes to him in the 3rd book, Edmund forgives Eustace in an impressive manner. We may never know if Edmund was able to forgive himself for his early actions in the first book.For the most part, this animated film follows the book very well. The only real  difference is that in the book, it's Father Christmas who gives the children their weapons. In this film, it's Aslan who gives them their weapons.Some people may miss the part where when the children and the beavers are running away, Mrs. Beaver insisted on taking the sewing machine with them.  (If you want to see that scene, it is in the 80s BBC version.) Overall though, these people did a very good job of fitting the book into 1 1/2 hours.There are 2 other versions of this film. (The 80s BBC Version and the 2006 Disney version.) The other 2 films certainly have some good points. However, in my opinion, it's this 1979 animated film that stays the closest to the book.If you like ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" you should also check out these books by C.S. Lewis. ""Mere Christianity"" and ""The Screwtape Letters.""",5,Winter Is No More In Narnia!,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,4203,"['who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'part', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'are', '7', 'books', '1', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', '2', 'Prince', 'Caspian', '3', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader', '4', 'Silver', 'Chair', '5', 'Horse', 'Boy', '6', 'Magician', 'Nephew', '7', 'Last', 'Battle', 'Though', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'first', '4', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'movies', 'appreciate', 'story', 'most', 'have', 'keep', 'mind', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'was', 'atheist', 'who', 'eventually', 'converted', 'Anglicanism', 'Anglo', 'Catholicism', 'prefer', 'story', '4', 'Pevensie', 'children', 'Peter', 'Susan', 'Edmund', 'Lucy', 'youngest', 'one', 'Lucy', 'claims', 'have', 'gone', 'wardrobe', 'land', 'Narnia', 'where', 'evil', 'queen', 'certain', 'always', 'winter', 'there', 'never', 'Christmas', 'None', 'other', '3', 'children', 'believe', 'Lucy', 'Edmund', 'especially', 'rude', 'However', 'Lucy', 'beliefs', 'Later', 'Edmund', 'be', 'true', 'evil', 'queen', 'Perhaps', 'feeling', 'picked', 'Edmund', 'liking', 'worth', 'noting', 'political', 'charm', 'even', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'first', 'encounter', 'Edmund', 'Edmund', 'later', 'Lucy', 'who', 'now', 'convinced', 'Edmund', 'will', 'back', 'up', 'story', 'Peter', 'Susan', 'especially', 'vile', 'moment', 'out', 'denies', 'it.Eventually', 'children', 'end', 'up', 'Narnia', 'Edmund', 'caught', 'vile', 'lie', '4', 'children', 'soon', 'run', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Beaver', 'who', 'explain', 'children', 'evil', 'queen', 'who', 'Christmas', 'Narnia', 'hope', 'noble', 'lion', 'Aslan', 'who', 'obviously', 'suppose', 'represent', 'Jesus', 'coming', 'may', 'wonder', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Beaver', 'represent', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'wife.Perhaps', 'moved', 'misplaced', 'compassion', 'Edmund', 'queen', 'brother', 'sisters', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'queen', 'truly', 'evil', 'one', 'Narnia', 'now', 'Edmund', 'been', 'vile', 'repulsive', 'start', 'redemption', 'convincing', 'when', 'lives', 'animals', 'forest', 'having', 'picnic', 'just', 'evil', 'queen', 'stone.The', 'other', '3', 'children', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Beaver', 'make', 'Aslan', 'things', 'start', 'look', 'good', 'Peter', 'fight', 'off', 'evil', 'queen', 'forces', 'penitent', 'Edmund', 'even', 'rescued', 'clearly', 'cast', 'off', 'past', 'ways.However', 'problem', 'queen', 'entitled', 'kill', 'Aslan', 'save', 'Edmund', 'must', 'walk', 'sorrowful', 'steps', 'Good', 'Friday', 'WARNING', 'Good', 'Friday', 'scene', 'where', 'Aslan', 'surprisingly', 'graphic', 'parents', 'may', 'wish', 'screen', 'show', 'children.However', 'sorrowful', 'events', 'Good', 'Friday', 'are', 'soon', 'followed', 'glorious', 'events', 'Easter', 'Sunday', 'Aslan', 'return', 'nothing', 'short', 'glorious', 'top', 'off', 'Edmund', 'now', 'redeemed', 'extreme', 'admirable', 'courage', 'when', 'crucial', 'moment', 'destroy', 'evil', 'queen', 'power.On', 'side', 'note', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'later', 'books', 'Edmund', 'heroic', 'redeemed', 'Furthermore', 'when', 'once', 'obnoxious', 'later', 'penitent', 'Eustace', '3rd', 'book', 'Edmund', 'Eustace', 'impressive', 'manner', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'Edmund', 'was', 'able', 'forgive', 'early', 'actions', 'first', 'most', 'part', 'animated', 'film', 'book', 'very', 'well', 'only', 'real', 'difference', 'book', 'Father', 'Christmas', 'who', 'children', 'weapons', 'film', 'Aslan', 'who', 'weapons.Some', 'people', 'may', 'miss', 'part', 'where', 'when', 'children', 'beavers', 'are', 'running', 'away', 'Mrs.', 'Beaver', 'insisted', 'taking', 'sewing', 'machine', 'want', 'see', 'scene', '80s', 'BBC', 'version', 'Overall', 'people', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'fitting', 'book', '1', '1/2', 'hours.There', 'are', '2', 'other', 'versions', 'film', '80s', 'BBC', 'Version', '2006', 'Disney', 'version', 'other', '2', 'films', 'certainly', 'have', 'good', 'points', 'However', 'opinion', '1979', 'animated', 'film', 'closest', 'book.If', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'should', 'also', 'check', 'out', 'books', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'Mere', 'Christianity', 'Screwtape', 'Letters']",N/A
1422925,A3C94LV082BV2T,B004OBQDFM,"J. Davis ""Just a guy.""","[6, 8]","This little animated version of ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" was my introduction to the story and to Narnia itself. I remember seeing it on VHS, and then we got our own copy. Years later, a DVD released by Alpha & Omega Publishing was the first Narnia DVD I ever bought, but it was bare bones to say the least! Later, it was re-released by the Sterling Company twice. I bought their second version with many new bonus features. However, that had a ""digitally remastered"" print that had been cropped to widescreen.I found this edition in a store and picked it up, despite seeing that it had been cropped to widescreen, because it had the British English audio as a separate track. (They had a different voice cast for the UK airing, except for Aslan.) It is also the first one to have subtitles. Most (but not all) of the bonus features from the Sterling Special Edition are carried over as well.Though the animation is far from the animation quality that Narnia deserves, it manages to help tell the story very well, and clocking in at about 95 minutes, it is also the shortest visual adaptation of C.S. Lewis' first Narnia story, sticking very closely to the book. Most of the dialogue is even derived from Lewis' text. The only real difference is that Father Christmas does not appear and Aslan gives Peter, Susan, and Lucy their gifts.The reason why I can't give this a five is because the picture is widescreen. If this had been how it was originally presented, I would have no problem, but this production was made in the late 1970s for television. It is NOT the complete picture, as even a new viewer should realize at seeing the tops of character's faces cut off.If only the complete picture was on the set, I would have happily dispensed with my Alpha & Omega DVD, but as it is, I think I'll hold onto it for a bit longer.FEATURES:* Audio commentary* Deleted sequence (audio and storyboards only)* Picture galleries featuring behind the scenes photos and character and animation designs* British and American English tracks as well as subtitles (wouldn't normally list those, but I'll give in here.)FEATURES NOT CARRIED OVER FROM STERLING ""SPECIAL EDITION* Producer interview* Menu-based features including a biography and bibliography for C.S.

Narnia is supposed to be a land without humans; a land completely different from England.  Correct?  Well, why is it a problem that Father Christmas doesn't show up and it's never Christmas?  Those are human-invented matters.  How would Narnians have even been exposed to the Christian religion?  Second, the Witch gives Edmund Turkish delight.  (Btw, I think that is a treat similar to Twizzlers.)  If Narnians know nothing about mankind, then how can they know about a human country called Turkey where they invented Turkish delight?
