710173,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B00006AUHA,Matthew Gladney,"[71, 71]","Imagine my excitement when I found that the first two seasons of ""As Time Goes By"" are heading for the DVD format. It is simply a wonderful series, well-deserving of such good video treatment. The previous season to be released on DVD (season 4) looked absolutely stunning in the crystal clear format. The images just came alive. Very beautiful. I already own these episodes on VHS, but there is no question that I will more than happily re-buy them.""As Time Goes By"" begins here with Lionel Hardcastle (the sublime Geoffrey Palmer) needing a secretary to help type-up the manuscript to his new book ""My Life In Kenya"". The secretarial agency he hires is run by Jean Pargetter (the great Judi Dench). Lionel and Jean meet, and realize that they used to be sweethearts 38 years previous, in the few short months before Lionel was sent away to the Korean War. After they parted, they lost touch, got re-married, and moved on with their lives. Now Jean is widowed and Lionel is divorced, and the stage is set for a possibly warm reunion.Warm is not the word to describe the first season, however. The romance is very up and down, and there are actually other *possible* love interests that come into the fray. But the season does have its positively sweet moments -- pre-cursors of the enjoyable situations to come. And I found the up & down nature of the romance at first one of the more believable elements. Relationships aren't always easy, whether new or old, and to show that two people who are really meant for each other may hit some bumps along the way, almost makes the romance that much more satisfying when things start working out.I love ""As Time Goes By"". There are very few TV series that I can say that about - less than I can count on one hand - but this is one of them. The writing is always impeccable, the acting superb, and the stories warm and funny. And on DVD, it all looks great.

710176,AT0E6UBVJMJ6W,B00006AUHA,Ms Winston,"[61, 61]","Okay,I have never met a British TV series that I didn't like,so it comes as no surprise to anyone who knows me that I own Sets 1-V of As Time Goes By. It is a gentle, civilized comedy about two lovers separated by a undelivered letter forty years before the series opens in c. 1992. Judy Dench and Geoffrey Palmer, as Jean and Lionel, are the perfect middle age lovers: Jean has lines on her face, is not a stick in a size 0 dress, and Lionel has jowls and thinning hair. It matters not! They adore each other and we adore them! The supporting cast is excellent -- especially the young women who portray Judy and Sandy, Jean's daughter by her first marriage, and her assistant respectively. Nothing very profound can be resolved in 30 minutes, but what is is interesting is the process of rediscovery, falling in love, and learning to love and accept each other, ""warts and all,"" that the viewer sees in episode after episode. It is refreshing to see that someone believes that love is just not for the under 30 set. Jean and Lionel are never treated as ""cute,"" as in ""how cute that people that age can be in love."" Why they even have sex -- always implied and never seen -- and it is treated as a natural and normal state of being for a middle aged couple.
