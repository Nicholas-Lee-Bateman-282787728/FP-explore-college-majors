It tracks the mythos of Batman's very early days of crime-fighting. You'll enjoy his mishaps and blunders. At the same time, it tracks his older days (perhaps mid-30's) where he's such a well-oiled machine of a superhero that he almost gives you the creeps.The plot revolves around romantic relationships and murder. I would not recommend this movie for children under 13.Batman: Subzero is fairly standard Batman fair. It's not a bad movie at all, but it's a dim cousin to the Mask of the Phantasm. The animators tried to insert 3d computer graphics into the movie, which lost a lot of its luster. But the story is very human and you'll have a difficult time not feeling sympathetic for the villain -- which is the best kind.Both movies are quite good. If you've never seen them and you like Batman, then you are completely in the dark. Buy them right now!If you've seen them before or you own one or the other, you might do better to pick up a different collection.

1118503,A3UQNIT3F07UIQ,B000YDBP84,Eugene M. Roby,"[0, 0]","Growing up in the late 80s and early 90s Batman: The Animated Series (TAS) played a huge role on in my childhood. Batman TAS was the Batman I grew up with. I remember trying to catch every espisode of this cartoon, that I could. Batman TAS was a revolutionary carton and broke many barriers for its time, it's dark tone and atmosphere, and the fact that guns actually shot bullets (not laser beams) set this cartoon apart from most of the cartoons of this era, and the cartoons I grew up with. After a couple of years of dominating the TV, this series was ported to the Theatrical cartoon movie format with ""Mask of the Phantasm."" At the time Disney animated/musical features dominated this market, so it was cool and revolutionary to have something else to go see. I never saw this movie on the big screen and wish I had.The Mask of the Phantasm deals with a vigilante, named The Phantasm, murdering key members of the Gotham criminal/ mob underworld. I do not want to give too much of the story away, but Batman has to deal with this character, in order to stop him, and avoid the blame that he himself is taking for the murders, due to the their relatively similar appearance. On top of that a love from Bruce's past has come back, and Batman faces the choice of either maintaining his crusade against crime or giving it all up to live a ""normal life"" with the woman he has always loved. The acting, animation, and writing are excellent, keeping with the quality of Batman TAS. This movie is kind of like Batman TAS's version of Long Halloween, which is pretty awesome.Subzero, the second film in this set, was a direct to video release. Released during the ""New Adventures of Batman and Robin"" era of Batman TAS, this movie was released after Mask of the Phantasm, and to be honest I don't remember it much at all. Keeping with it's namesake, this movie centers around Mr. Freeze. In this story, Mr. Freeze who is living in the artic with his cryo-frozen wife, eskimo boy, and two polar bears, have their peaceful life interrupted, when a research submarine un-intentionally surfaces in their lair, destroying Mr. Freezes tranquility, and endangering Mr. Freeze's cryo-frozen wife by destroying her freezing chamber. As a result, Mr. Freeze retruns to Gotham City to get the materials to save his wife, and crime and mayhem ensues. I really like the insight into the character of Mr. Freeze you get with this movie, and who better to do it than the people/series which redefined this character. The Mr. Freeze we know today was created by Batman TAS, even though the character was originally conceived in the 1960s. In my opinion this movie is the weaker of the two, but still a pretty decent watch.My only complaint with this set is the lack of special features, this set is pretty bare bones when it comes to this department.I recommend this for any Batman/ Batman TAS fan. It amazes me that after 15 or so years, these stories seem as fresh as they were when they came out. For anyone who wants to tap into or try out Batman TAS, this set is a good place to start, and will open the door to a great part of the Batman universe.",4,A great Batman double feature,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,3134,"['Growing', 'up', 'late', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'TAS', 'played', 'huge', 'role', 'childhood', 'Batman', 'TAS', 'was', 'Batman', 'grew', 'up', 'remember', 'trying', 'catch', 'espisode', 'cartoon', 'could', 'Batman', 'TAS', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'carton', 'broke', 'many', 'barriers', 'time', 'dark', 'tone', 'atmosphere', 'fact', 'actually', 'shot', 'bullets', 'not', 'laser', 'beams', 'set', 'cartoon', 'apart', 'most', 'cartoons', 'era', 'cartoons', 'grew', 'up', 'couple', 'years', 'dominating', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'ported', 'Theatrical', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'format', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', 'time', 'Disney', 'animated/musical', 'features', 'dominated', 'market', 'was', 'cool', 'revolutionary', 'have', 'something', 'else', 'go', 'see', 'never', 'saw', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'wish', 'had.The', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', 'deals', 'vigilante', 'named', 'Phantasm', 'murdering', 'key', 'members', 'Gotham', 'criminal/', 'mob', 'underworld', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'away', 'Batman', 'deal', 'character', 'order', 'stop', 'avoid', 'blame', 'taking', 'murders', 'due', 'relatively', 'similar', 'appearance', 'top', 'love', 'Bruce', 'past', 'come', 'back', 'Batman', 'choice', 'maintaining', 'crusade', 'crime', 'giving', 'up', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'woman', 'always', 'loved', 'acting', 'animation', 'writing', 'are', 'excellent', 'keeping', 'quality', 'Batman', 'TAS', 'movie', 'kind', 'Batman', 'TAS', 'version', 'Long', 'Halloween', 'pretty', 'awesome.Subzero', 'second', 'film', 'set', 'was', 'direct', 'video', 'release', 'Released', 'New', 'Adventures', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'era', 'Batman', 'TAS', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'Keeping', 'namesake', 'movie', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'story', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'who', 'living', 'artic', 'cryo-frozen', 'wife', 'eskimo', 'boy', 'two', 'polar', 'bears', 'have', 'peaceful', 'life', 'interrupted', 'when', 'research', 'submarine', 'un-intentionally', 'surfaces', 'lair', 'destroying', 'Mr', 'Freezes', 'tranquility', 'endangering', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'cryo-frozen', 'wife', 'destroying', 'freezing', 'chamber', 'result', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'Gotham', 'City', 'get', 'materials', 'save', 'wife', 'crime', 'mayhem', 'ensues', 'really', 'insight', 'character', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'get', 'movie', 'who', 'better', 'do', 'people/series', 'redefined', 'character', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'know', 'today', 'was', 'created', 'Batman', 'TAS', 'even', 'character', 'was', 'originally', 'conceived', '1960s', 'opinion', 'movie', 'weaker', 'two', 'still', 'pretty', 'decent', 'only', 'complaint', 'set', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'set', 'pretty', 'bare', 'bones', 'when', 'department.I', 'recommend', 'Batman/', 'Batman', 'TAS', 'fan', '15', 'so', 'years', 'stories', 'seem', 'as', 'fresh', 'were', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'anyone', 'who', 'tap', 'try', 'out', 'Batman', 'TAS', 'set', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'will', 'open', 'door', 'great', 'part', 'Batman', 'universe']",N/A

1118506,A1JF5GGQFSGP9Z,B000YDBP84,"Joseph Parker ""precisionspared""","[3, 5]","This is the only movie on IMDB that is higher than the Dark Knight, and while I'm not sure that I agree, I don't exactly disagree either.  I love the Dark Knight and what Christopher Nolan has done in creating the Batman Universe into the real world with a lot of psychology and modern day references to terrorists and polotics, and its an amazing piece of work, but what it fails to do is to take into account all the childhood batman myths that comic fans have loved for generations, and the fox animated series did.  It was what Tim Burton wanted to do in the movies, and all the big enemies were treated without kid gloves, and given full backstories, and the art direction is just amazing.  I am not really a comic book fan, and I probably wouldn't know about so many of these characters had that series not existed.  Mak of the Phantasm is the best movie to come from that show, and is included in this set, and is the cheapest way to obtain it, and they throw in another pretty good movie along with it.  Sub Zero is about average fair for what the tv show was, having Mr. Freeze trying to bring his frozen wife back to life, and they found that Bat girl has matching DNA that would allow this to happen, and MR. Freeze has paid off the hospital to see that this happens.  The show spends plenty of time making the Mr. Freeze character sympathetic, but I think with the amount of time he was on the show, this whole movie just seems plaid out and better left for a show miniseries.  Mask is almost just as good at asking all the moral questions about justice and vigilante means in a corrupt society, and the psychology of law enforcement as almost any movie ever made, and like Dark Knight, it takes all of the complex ideas and manages to be able to explain them all to the smallest child.  I think that kind of story telling should definately be rewarded, but while as a stand alone it might not be as strong as the live action movie in question, where is succeeds is that it takes the character of Batman that you see over five seasons on the show and builds on him and his relationshps.

Also confusing is the DVDs packaging that puts SubZero before Mask of the Phantasm in nearly every respect.The two sides of the discs are complete duplicates of the original releases and contain nothing new. Exact same menus and exact same video transfers. They could've taken the time to hunt down that 5.1 surround track for SubZero that was released on LaserDisc and tossed it on here, but that's not what this release was meant for. A quick cash in on the ever growing popularity of one of comic books most famous heroes. Here's hoping we'll see a more worthy release for Mask of the Phantasm come it's twentieth anniversary.For those that don't already own these two films, it's a cheap alternative to buying two different DVD releases, but for those that already have these two releases it's a definite downgrade. Not only do you have to still deal with a flipper disc, you lose the widescreen transfer of Mask of the Phantasm. Not a huge loss considering the film was animated in fullscreen, but still. This is really just a cash cow release that, one can hope, was just released to check the interest in these two films to see if future special editions are warranted.

I know I probably paid a lot more for each videocassette than I did for this DVD.Mask of the Phantasm was WB's attempt to cash in on their wildly successful animated series that ran from 1992 to 1995 (then it changed names and networks and ran for a couple more seasons.)  Originally, it was going to be a DTV (Direct to Video) movie but then WB made the not-so-wise decision to release it in the theaters and only gave the filmmakers 8 months to get it ready for the big screen, which caused the film to bomb.  However, it has become a ""cult classic"" by becoming popular among its original intended audience:  home video viewers.  It's a dark tale of revenge that has a few plot twists along the way and keeps new viewers guessing as to who the Phantasm is until the end (unless they figure it out.)  It also flashes back to when Bruce was first starting out as the caped crusader and offers some nice glimpses into his early days as Batman.  The animation is a fantastic blend of CGI and hand drawings and the story is great.  However, I know I wouldn't have wanted to see a 1:33:1 aspect ratio film in the theater, so I can kind of see why it bombed.  But, it looks great on TV, even on my 32-inch LCD 720p HDTV.SubZero is a DTV movie they did 5 years after Mask of the Phantasm.  The story is more straight forward, no real plot twists.  Mr. Freeze's wife is dying (as she was on the TV series) and she requires a transplant.  Of course, she has a rare blood type, the same type that Barbara Gordon has.  So, with the aid of a shady former colleague, Mr. Freeze kidnaps Barbara in an attempt to save his wife's life and it's up to Batman and Robin to save her.  Like Mask of the Phantasm, SubZero has great animation and a great story.  Both films also feature really nice soundtracks.Personally, I think this DVD is great.  Two movies for one low price.  Plus, it's a flip disc, which comes in handy.  After watching Mask of the Phantasm, I just flipped the disc to watch SubZero.  As others have noted, the packaging and disc are a little odd.  SubZero is shown first on the box art and is on side A of the disc, even though Mask of the Phantasm is the earlier film.  Since I remember these films well and know in which order they go, this wasn't a problem for me, but I can see where it would be confusing for people who aren't familiar with the movies.  The only reason I can think of that they did this is because SubZero is considered a success, while Mask of the Phantasm isn't (due to WB's decision to release a movie that should have gone DTV in the theaters.)",5,Great Films,1347062400,"09 8, 2012",2012,2691,"['used', 'have', 'films', 'videocassette', 'back', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'DVD', 'know', 'probably', 'paid', 'lot', 'more', 'videocassette', 'did', 'DVD.Mask', 'Phantasm', 'was', 'WB', 'attempt', 'cash', 'wildly', 'successful', 'animated', 'series', 'ran', '1992', '1995', 'then', 'changed', 'names', 'networks', 'ran', 'couple', 'more', 'seasons', 'Originally', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'DTV', 'Direct', 'Video', 'movie', 'then', 'WB', 'made', 'not-so-wise', 'decision', 'release', 'theaters', 'only', 'gave', 'filmmakers', '8', 'months', 'get', 'ready', 'big', 'screen', 'caused', 'film', 'bomb', 'However', 'become', 'cult', 'classic', 'becoming', 'popular', 'original', 'intended', 'audience', 'home', 'video', 'viewers', 'dark', 'tale', 'revenge', 'few', 'plot', 'twists', 'way', 'new', 'viewers', 'guessing', 'who', 'Phantasm', 'end', 'figure', 'out', 'also', 'back', 'when', 'Bruce', 'was', 'first', 'starting', 'out', 'caped', 'crusader', 'nice', 'glimpses', 'early', 'days', 'Batman', 'animation', 'fantastic', 'blend', 'CGI', 'hand', 'drawings', 'story', 'great', 'However', 'know', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'wanted', 'see', '1:33:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'film', 'theater', 'can', 'kind', 'see', 'why', 'bombed', 'great', 'TV', 'even', '32-inch', 'LCD', '720p', 'HDTV.SubZero', 'DTV', 'movie', 'did', '5', 'years', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', 'story', 'more', 'straight', 'forward', 'real', 'plot', 'twists', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'wife', 'dying', 'was', 'TV', 'series', 'transplant', 'course', 'rare', 'blood', 'type', 'same', 'type', 'Barbara', 'Gordon', 'So', 'aid', 'shady', 'former', 'colleague', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'Barbara', 'attempt', 'save', 'wife', 'life', 'up', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'save', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', 'SubZero', 'great', 'animation', 'great', 'story', 'films', 'also', 'feature', 'really', 'nice', 'soundtracks.Personally', 'think', 'DVD', 'great', 'Two', 'movies', 'one', 'low', 'price', 'flip', 'disc', 'handy', 'watching', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', 'just', 'flipped', 'disc', 'watch', 'SubZero', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'packaging', 'disc', 'are', 'little', 'odd', 'SubZero', 'shown', 'first', 'box', 'art', 'side', 'A', 'disc', 'even', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', 'earlier', 'film', 'remember', 'films', 'well', 'know', 'order', 'go', 'was', ""n't"", 'problem', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'confusing', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'movies', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'think', 'did', 'SubZero', 'considered', 'success', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', ""n't"", 'due', 'WB', 'decision', 'release', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'DTV', 'theaters']",N/A
