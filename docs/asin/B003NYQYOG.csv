It is a shame that it took so long to defeat a government which is at the bottom of the cesspool.  Corruption shown at it finest.  Magnificent example of how the Pope and Church works to right wrongs.  Nothing changes overnight, but with the correct people at the right time anything is possible.

Being of Polish heritage, I remember how thrilled my parents and Poles throughout the world were to have one of their own elevated to the highest position in the Catholic church.  This book provided information I was unaware of, so it was a learning experience as well as a reading pleasure for me.  While the Pope was disliked by some, he was loved and admired by so many more who looked up to him as their leader.  What a strong, courageous, and humble man he was.

Pope John Paul II was able to remind millions of Polish people that the source of their freedom is God, even under the most oppressive government.  I loved the interviews from people who were there, who heard the pope speak, and who saw how an entire nation went from having their heads down to pride in culture and optimism that Truth will bring about freedom. The footage of the crowds of MILLIONS was amazing.  Oh to have been part of those gatherings.It sent chills up my spine this summer when the Democrat party took God out of their platform at the convention and then, in a very bizzare vote, put the name of God back in.  Why would Americans want to do to themselves what the Soviet Union did to Poland?  We need to learn the lessons of Poland's history and never allow this to happen to us.Thank you Gingrich productions for this amazing film.",5,We want God!,1347494400,"09 13, 2012",2012,894,"['loved', 'film', 'loved', 'IT', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'was', 'able', 'remind', 'millions', 'Polish', 'people', 'source', 'freedom', 'God', 'even', 'most', 'oppressive', 'government', 'loved', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'who', 'heard', 'pope', 'speak', 'who', 'saw', 'how', 'entire', 'nation', 'went', 'having', 'heads', 'down', 'pride', 'culture', 'optimism', 'Truth', 'will', 'bring', 'about', 'freedom', 'footage', 'crowds', 'MILLIONS', 'was', 'amazing', 'Oh', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'gatherings.It', 'sent', 'up', 'spine', 'summer', 'when', 'Democrat', 'party', 'took', 'God', 'platform', 'convention', 'then', 'very', 'bizzare', 'vote', 'put', 'name', 'God', 'back', 'Why', 'would', 'Americans', 'want', 'do', 'what', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'did', 'Poland', 'need', 'learn', 'lessons', 'Poland', 'history', 'never', 'allow', 'happen', 'us.Thank', 'Gingrich', 'productions', 'amazing', 'film']",N/A
