Coincidentally, on board the train is a deadly biological weapon. After the train's first stop terrorists; led by the sadistic Mason Cole (Thomas Arana from GLADIATOR) board with the goal of finding and stealing the vial containing the deadly virus. What they plan to use it for is anyone's guess.Now for coincidence #2: Among the train's passengers are Kristoff's wife and son. Things really start getting heavy when the virus is let loose throughout the train thanks to the bunglings of one of the terrorists. The leader lets him off lightly though: the culprit is promptly shot through the head, as all nasty terrorists types are wont to do. But as we all know by now, you don't mess with Jean-Claude. Especially when his family is involved. Butt-kicking time.The movie starts starts OK, but soon derails itself. The addition of unconvincing minature setpieces and an overall air of stupidity make DERAILED about as explosive as a Bay City Rollers reunion. This movie looks and feels no different to any of the other direct to video actioners with stars like Michael Dudikoff and Jeff Speakman. DERAILED is a pretty anemic effort, but not Jean-Claude's worst: NO RETREAT NO SURRENDER and CYBORG are both tied for that dubious honor, but if like myself you're a Van Damme completist you'll want to watch it anyway.

717061,A2DQR20UWY2G0Y,B00006IUFZ,"Dr. Metal ""e23adams""","[1, 1]","I don't know what impelled JC Van Damme to make this movie because its such a low standard performance from virtually everyone involved.While I haven't see all of his movies, I've seen most of them and that's why this is such a disappointment.  I mean, movies like Time Cop, Universal Soldier, Sudden Death or Hard Targets, were all great and absolutely watchable action flicks but Derailed has nothing even remotely watchable in comparison.I think we can all agree that a good movie consists of the following elements: a good preferably exciting story, good to excellent acting, and if necessary great action and special effects scenes.  Yet, Derail has not a single one of those necessary elements in it!First of all, there is the story, or rather what is being called a story. It is so riddled with down right rediculous plot holes that it makes you wonder how a straight thinking person could come up with something this unbelievable.  Then there's the acting, or shall we say earnest attempts at acting.  Honestly, I've never seen JC Van Damme so uninspired in terms of acting, but unfortunately the rest of the crew seemed to feel right at home with this lame performance and join the protagonist in what can only be called substandard acting.  Then finally, there are the so-called special effects, which are simply laughable.  I mean, who are they trying to kid with these cheapo effects.  The train on which most of the movie takes place is for example a toy train when viewed from above and the helicopters are also cheap models.  Really, this should be way below Van Damme's dignity to pass off such cheap scenes for action that is supposed to rescue a sinking ship.If you want to see a good to great action movie that is taking place on a train go for Steven Segal's Undersiege 2, there he shows what a great train action movie has to look like.So drop this from you shopping list, if you ever had it on it.  There are so many better films by Van Damme, virtually all of them beat this one by light years.

So the other day I said to my self I should watch one of his films I hadn't seen in a while, ""Derailed"" was the one I went with. It was a wise choice because this is a very entreating movie, much better then I remembered. I still don't know which I think is better, this film with Van Damme or ""Under Siege 2"" with Steven Seagal which was also on a train.The story is about Jacques Kristoff who is hired to escort a woman named Galina Konstantin onto a train and get her across the border. Of course it wasn't that easy since she is carrying a bio weapon on board and some terrorists are after it. Of course in true Van Damme fashion he fights them all on board a speeding train. And to make things worse his family is on board and the virus breaks loose on all the passengers.Writer's Adam Gierasch, Jace Anderson, and writer producer Boaz Davidson have created a pretty good movie with plenty of action. Under the direction of Bob Misiorowski this film is actually a really good film, even my grandmother liked it. Also along side Boaz Davidson there is seven other producers including Avi Lerner, that is a lot of people producing one film. Of course what sets this apart from other similar films is Van Damme and his style of action, which is excellent and exciting. And of course Van Damme's performance is great as is the rest of the cast. Laura Harring does a good job as Galina who has the virus, and Tomas Arana as Mason Cole is excellent as the lead villain in this film. The rest of the cast is just as good, all the bad guys Van Damme's family [including real life son], and train passengers are amazing in their supporting roles.This is a very good movie for a boring day at home when you just want to relax.

You start off with this Spy Chick steals a vial with Small Pox I'm like WTF? Our main character Jaques Kristoff a NATO opertive is on a mission it's his birthday of all days he has to leave his family. Him & the Spy Chick have to go to Frankfort Germany to Jaques superiors. While on board The Spy Chick wants to f**k  Jaques & ""Nope I'm married."" Then he's suprised by his wife & kids & they find Spy Chick his wife thinks he's cheating. This was dumb sub plots 101. There's this stupid back & forth between this 1 guy & a cowboy want to be these terrorists take over the train & I swear the guy playing the main villain went to ""The Timothy Olpyphant school of playing villains."" There's action scenes with Van Damme's character & The Spy Chick where they use a split screen it's not cool at all somehow they're captured & they find the vials This Spy Chick knocks them out of the lead Terrorists hand lots of people get sick but people born before 1979 aren't effected cause vaccines don't exist anymore. I forgot a lot of stuff Van Damme kills a lot of Terroristsit sorry it's forgettable. I hated This Spy Chick it's her fault that people are sick. The only cool part was the motorcycle scene it's greenscreened though & the CGI is bad in this movie. Jaques commanding officer decides to blow the train to stop the Small Pox from going wide spread. I don't remember how the main Terrorist was killed. The score wasn't too bad It turns out Van Damme's superior officer was bad WOW! A few months later Spy Chick it shows her stealing some jewellery & we get a terrible rap song. JCVD has had his great films he's had some so bad there good guilty plesures & then there's movies that are guilty of being awful. This movie & Universal Soldier Regeneration are tied for being the worst Van Damme movies I say USR becuse of the expectation & all I got was an hour & 15 minutes of people being punched to death.

The production values and the dark way the frames are shot makes it come across as a ""B"" flick, but it keeps our attention as we roll through this action.  I enjoyed Susan Gibney who plays Madeleine, Van Damme's wife.  She's appeared in a number of ""Star Trek"" TV episodes, ""Waterdance"" with Helen Hunt, and an independent film from last year called ""Besotted.""  She plays a doctor and wife. She thinks that Claude is cheating on her when she shows up on the train with the the kids to surprise him for his birthday and finds him with Galina Konstatin, played by the beautiful Laura Harring.  I enjoyed how her doctor impulses come to the fore as she ministers to the passengers exposed to the deadly SP-43 strain of smallpox. Van Damme as Jacques Kristoff does his usual number of stunts, climbing through vents, wrestling on the top of a moving train, and driving a mototrcycle off the train & back again!  Jean Claude's real-life son also plays his cinematic son here as Kristopher (Van Damme) Van Varenberg gets a couple sweet kicks into the bad guys himself.  The film concludes with the lessons that no matter how high up one is, they must be accountable as Jacques' NATO boss Lars gets hauled off to jail.  This may not be the quintessential Van Damme film; however, it serves to keep our attention and moves nicely with director Bob Misiorowski's pacing.

717071,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00006IUFZ,Martin Asiner,"[6, 9]","Jean Claude Van Damme made his reputation in the late 80's and early 90's with martial arts movies that involved his entering a kumite, winner take all.  In BLOODSPORT and KICKBOXER, his athleticism, good looks, and never-say-die persona were magnified in confrontations with a killer bad guy, usually played by Bolo or Michel Quissi.  The fights in those films were seen as intriguing choreographed versions of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.  As long as JCVD stuck to that type of film, he stood out and the movie did good box office.  Eventually, he felt that he could branch out into being an action star along the lines of Steven Seagal or Jackie Chan.  The brutal truth about his acting talent is that it is limited to the savage ring fighting of his early career.  With DERAILED, JCVD proves once again that his acting, when combined with laughable special effects, cheesy writing, and illogically paced fight sequences, cannot compensate for these other deficiencies.  In DERAILED, he plays Jacques Kristoff, a CIA type who is hired to bring in a sexy Russian female who has ripped off her Mafia boss to the tune of a deadly smallpox serum, which is released into the air of the train on which all are riding.  The plot holes are big enough for that train to drive right through without hitting a bump.  His wife and children surprise him by meeting him on the train, only to be taken hostage along with the other passengers.  If this sounds a little like DIE HARD meets SIEGE, then you have already figured out the ending.  The bad guys are tough enough, but JCVD's fights with them are claustrophobic, thus negating the allure of his high kicks. Instead, he has to resort to the grappling devices like chokes and ankle locks that I found to be the most interesting part.  DERAILED is a glitzy movie with lots of pretty girls, tough guys, and short combat scenes, but the feeling that I had at the conclusion is that if JCVD wants to avoid the continual embarrassment of straight to video flicks like this one, he would do well to remember the kind of movie that made him a superstar in the first place.",2,JCVD has DERAILED his fans,1036800000,"11 9, 2002",2002,2116,"['Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'made', 'reputation', 'late', '80', 'early', '90', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'involved', 'entering', 'kumite', 'winner', 'take', 'BLOODSPORT', 'KICKBOXER', 'athleticism', 'good', 'looks', 'never-say-die', 'persona', 'were', 'magnified', 'confrontations', 'killer', 'bad', 'guy', 'usually', 'played', 'Bolo', 'Michel', 'Quissi', 'fights', 'films', 'were', 'seen', 'intriguing', 'choreographed', 'versions', 'Ultimate', 'Fighting', 'Championship', 'As', 'long', 'JCVD', 'stuck', 'type', 'film', 'stood', 'out', 'movie', 'did', 'good', 'box', 'office', 'Eventually', 'felt', 'could', 'branch', 'out', 'being', 'action', 'star', 'lines', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'brutal', 'truth', 'acting', 'talent', 'limited', 'savage', 'ring', 'fighting', 'early', 'career', 'DERAILED', 'JCVD', 'once', 'again', 'acting', 'when', 'combined', 'laughable', 'special', 'effects', 'cheesy', 'writing', 'illogically', 'paced', 'fight', 'sequences', 'can', 'not', 'compensate', 'other', 'deficiencies', 'DERAILED', 'Jacques', 'Kristoff', 'CIA', 'type', 'who', 'hired', 'bring', 'sexy', 'Russian', 'female', 'who', 'ripped', 'off', 'Mafia', 'boss', 'tune', 'deadly', 'smallpox', 'serum', 'released', 'air', 'train', 'are', 'riding', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'big', 'enough', 'train', 'drive', 'right', 'hitting', 'bump', 'wife', 'children', 'surprise', 'meeting', 'train', 'only', 'be', 'taken', 'hostage', 'other', 'passengers', 'little', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'SIEGE', 'then', 'have', 'already', 'figured', 'out', 'ending', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'tough', 'enough', 'JCVD', 'fights', 'are', 'claustrophobic', 'thus', 'negating', 'allure', 'high', 'kicks', 'Instead', 'resort', 'grappling', 'devices', 'chokes', 'ankle', 'locks', 'found', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'DERAILED', 'glitzy', 'movie', 'lots', 'pretty', 'girls', 'tough', 'guys', 'short', 'combat', 'scenes', 'feeling', 'had', 'conclusion', 'JCVD', 'avoid', 'continual', 'embarrassment', 'straight', 'video', 'flicks', 'one', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'remember', 'kind', 'movie', 'made', 'superstar', 'first', 'place']",Derailed

717074,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00006IUFZ,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","Since beginning his tenure in direct-to-video cinema, Jean-Claude Van Damme has been remarkably aware of how important it was for his movies to keep from blending in with the crowd of countless other DTV flicks; this willingness to try for originality gave rise to several better-than-average low-budgeteers likeReplicant,In Hell, andJCVD, and has generally given Van Damme fans more to celebrate than those of, say, Steven Seagal or Dolph Lundgren. ""Derailed"", however, has the dubious honor of fulfilling our hero's quota of having at least one universally uninteresting, poorly-made film for fans, casual viewers, and critics to bash the snot out of. The premise of ""Die Hardon a train"" has been done before and done better, so if you're in it for the theme, go watchUnder Siege 2: Dark Territory. If you're just watching it for the leading man, you're going to have to be a lot more tolerant than me to enjoy what feels like Van Damme's first mail-in movie.The story: NATO operative Jacques Kristoff (Van Damme) is sent abroad to escort a crafty secret agent (Laura Harring,Mulholland Drive) via train across Europe so she may deliver a top-secret biological weapon. When the train is hijacked by a group of terrorists (led by Tomas Arana,Gladiator) and the virus is released, Kristoff must race against time to take out the bad guys in time to save the passengers and stop a deadly railway collision.Let me start off by saying that there is no actual train in the movie - only models, like the kind your father or grandfather may have collected. The behind-the-scenes featurette gives the impression that a lot of effort went into constructing these, but on-screen, they represent the entire film by looking cheap. So does the pardon-the-budget CGI. So does the majority of the supporting cast: a collection of underpaid, accented internationals whose casting qualification was being able to look menacing or frightened; the highlight of this collection is Van Damme's real-life son Kristopher getting to throw a few karate kicks of his own. He outdoes his old man by doing this, for the fight scenes are collectively poor: even though real-life vale tudo champion Stefanos Miltsakakis was an excellent opponent for Van Damme inMaximum Risk, the film's fight director seemed to favor grappling over martial arts, so their encounter and most of the other fights is just a bunch of rolling around on the floor (although there is a cool scene where Van Damme nonchalantly picks up a bad guy and drops him into the train's engine housing).Director Bob Misiorowski's resume includes mainly bad TV films likeShark Attack, and the production of ""Derailed"" looks the same: you can tell from the first set of titles that this movie has been made with limited know-how and imagination, so prepare yourself for some weirdo editing techniques and convenient reality snafus for the sake of story progression (e.g. a henchwoman remains oblivious while Van Damme is beating up her buddy right behind her back because...well, I don't know why, seeing as her attention was only mildly diverted and Van Damme was making a lot of noise). Potentially cool things like Van Damme riding a motorbike atop the moving train are ruined by how inefficiently the editing department worked it together, and, in the end, it's difficult to care for the poorly-conceived characters; were it not for the wonder of IMDb, I wouldn't even remember their names.Following ""Derailed"", JCVD went back to making films ranging in quality between pretty good and watchable. Fans ought to count their blessings that they've only got this film to contend with when it comes to blatantly bad vehicles for their hero, and put it completely out of their minds. Newcomers, stay away. Stay far away. Pretend you don't even know this one exists - you'll save two hours of your life.",1,"""[Screw] you!

I found this to be a very bad movie with very low production values. There was nothing in this movie for me other than annoyance. Very poor direction, cheap and laughable special effects, particularly the exterior train sequences where the train looks like it is made of wood, illuminated with a light bulb from the inside and pulled along by a piece of string. Bad lighting, badly filmed, executed and edited martial arts and action sequences. Laughable acting performances from all including Van Damme. Very bad audio post production special effects to such an extent that at times you can't hear character dialogue. I got the impression that a lot of this was filmed in very low lighting conditions to hide the cheap sets and obvious poor special effects. Basically the movie is a cheap rip off version from a mix of Under Siege 2 with Steven Seagal and The Cassandra Crossing with the late Richard Harris.

717085,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00006IUFZ,trebe,"[1, 1]","In this direct to video action adventure, lovely Laura Harring (Mulholland Drive, Sunset Beach) is Galina Konstantin, a performer/thief who uses her unusual skills to steal deadly vials of smallpox virus.  Jean-Claude Van Damme is Jack Kristoff, a special agent assigned to lead her to safety, as the pair make their escape via Train 681 from Bratislava to Munich.  A crisis arises, when thieves seeking the bioweapon take over the train.  Things get worse, as Kristoff's family is aboard when one of the vials breaks and exposes the train's passengers to the disease, and people start to get sick.Van Damme's performance is perhaps slighter better than his usual standards.  Older, but still physically fit, he perhaps shows a skosh more depth as an actor.  His various fights combine flash with some gritty street fighting moves.  Susan Gibney plays his wife.  The supporting cast is serviceable, with the villains, lead by Mason Cole (Tomas Arana) having a typical comic book demeanor.  Van Damme's real life son, Kristopher Van Varenberg, appears as his character's son.Directed by Bob Misiorowski, the story could use some polishing, as nearly every movie clich&eacute; involving action on a train, short of Sinatra getting shot in the back is employed.  Though extremely poorly executed, Van Damme even rides a motorcycle across the roofs of moving train cars.The special effects, definitely suffer from budgetary limitations.  Lots of crappy looking CGI, and some of the shots of model trains and a helicopter look terrible.  Frequent cuts and choppy editing are often used in action sequences, to speed things along, and give the illusion that the action is continuous.  In general, the film often suffers from poor editing.There is an unreal time shift, probably attributable to special effects, as it is technically easier to do a crash at night, rather than the day.  While Train 681 is traveling at night, it is struck by another train.  The crash results in damage to both trains, and several cars fly off the track.  After the crash, Train 681 is able to continue on its way, however instead of still being dark, the sun is now up.  Even in the darkness, the stunt still looks terrible.Derailed has a serious tone, but just does not have the budget to carry it off very well, and ends up looking pretty ridiculous in places.  With all its shortcomings, the film rates two and a half stars tops, and is mainly recommended to Jean Claude diehards, or those who really enjoy an adventure on a train.",2,"wobbly, low budget, clich&eacute; ridden, train adventure . . .",1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,2510,"['direct', 'video', 'action', 'adventure', 'lovely', 'Laura', 'Harring', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'Sunset', 'Beach', 'Galina', 'Konstantin', 'performer/thief', 'who', 'unusual', 'skills', 'steal', 'deadly', 'vials', 'smallpox', 'virus', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Jack', 'Kristoff', 'special', 'agent', 'assigned', 'lead', 'safety', 'pair', 'make', 'escape', 'Train', '681', 'Bratislava', 'Munich', 'crisis', 'arises', 'when', 'thieves', 'seeking', 'bioweapon', 'take', 'train', 'Things', 'get', 'worse', 'Kristoff', 'family', 'aboard', 'when', 'one', 'vials', 'breaks', 'train', 'passengers', 'disease', 'people', 'start', 'get', 'sick.Van', 'Damme', 'performance', 'perhaps', 'slighter', 'better', 'usual', 'standards', 'Older', 'still', 'physically', 'fit', 'perhaps', 'skosh', 'more', 'depth', 'actor', 'various', 'fights', 'combine', 'flash', 'gritty', 'street', 'fighting', 'moves', 'Susan', 'Gibney', 'wife', 'supporting', 'cast', 'serviceable', 'villains', 'lead', 'Mason', 'Cole', 'Tomas', 'Arana', 'having', 'typical', 'comic', 'book', 'demeanor', 'Van', 'Damme', 'real', 'life', 'son', 'Kristopher', 'Van', 'Varenberg', 'character', 'son.Directed', 'Bob', 'Misiorowski', 'story', 'could', 'use', 'polishing', 'nearly', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'involving', 'action', 'train', 'short', 'Sinatra', 'getting', 'shot', 'back', 'employed', 'Though', 'extremely', 'poorly', 'executed', 'Van', 'Damme', 'even', 'motorcycle', 'roofs', 'moving', 'train', 'cars.The', 'special', 'effects', 'definitely', 'suffer', 'budgetary', 'limitations', 'Lots', 'crappy', 'looking', 'CGI', 'shots', 'model', 'trains', 'helicopter', 'look', 'terrible', 'Frequent', 'cuts', 'choppy', 'editing', 'are', 'often', 'used', 'action', 'sequences', 'speed', 'things', 'give', 'illusion', 'action', 'continuous', 'general', 'film', 'often', 'poor', 'unreal', 'time', 'shift', 'probably', 'attributable', 'special', 'effects', 'technically', 'easier', 'do', 'crash', 'night', 'rather', 'day', '681', 'traveling', 'night', 'struck', 'train', 'crash', 'results', 'damage', 'trains', 'several', 'cars', 'fly', 'off', 'track', 'crash', 'Train', '681', 'able', 'continue', 'way', 'however', 'instead', 'still', 'being', 'dark', 'sun', 'now', 'up', 'Even', 'darkness', 'stunt', 'still', 'terrible.Derailed', 'serious', 'tone', 'just', 'not', 'have', 'budget', 'carry', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'up', 'looking', 'pretty', 'ridiculous', 'places', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'rates', 'two', 'half', 'stars', 'tops', 'mainly', 'recommended', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'diehards', 'who', 'really', 'enjoy', 'adventure', 'train']",Derailed
717086,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00006IUFZ,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","Unlike other reviewers, I went to see this film to watch the actress Laura Elena Harring, the brunette beauty in David Lynch's cult film ""Mulholand Drive.""  Like Naomi Watte, she had to endure the long period of thankless roles -- films like ... er ...""Lambada"" or ... ""Little Nicky""(!).  And now Academy-Award nominee Naomi Watts hit the paydirt with ""The Ring.""  So what about her in ""Derailed""?Bad news.  She is terribly wasted.  She appears as a female thief internationally chased by the police.  And the secret agent Jack sent by NATO Jean-Claude Van Damme arrests her in Slovakia and send her to Germany on night train.  Don't ask me why night train.  I just forgot why they didn't use airplane, but never mind.  And for some reasons I still cannot comprehend, Jack's entire family members show up before embarrassed Jack on the platform, including his daughter (Jessica Bowman, ""Joy Ride"") and his son, who is Jean-Claude's real-life son under his real family name.  Huuuum.And the actions mainly happen on this train, where some deadly virus is spread.  Before you can say ""Under Siege 2"" or ""Cassandra Cross,"" the film rushes into a series of very cheesy, trashy action sequences, which are painful to see.  The settings are too incredible (bikes on the train roof?), the special effects are little better than B monster flicks made in the 50s, and acting and dialogues are simply awful.  As to the last part I could have forgiven and forgotten, if only the film gives decent action scenes or some original ideas.  No such luck here.And about Laura Elena Harring, all I can say is this.  She is as beautiful as ever, even among the mediocre dialogues and the poorly shot screen, and I really feel sorry for her.  This film is another proof that good directors like Lynch can induce the actors to give their best while ... the rest of it, no need to say.Like another action star Steven, Jean-Claude Van Damme skyrocketed to stardom in the 1990s, and I was then a faithful fan of both of them.  OK, they cannot act, I admit, but they are always entertaining, and got some kind of brio, only those guys can show.  I loved them for being what they were, and still do.  But now, I think somebody should stop them, especially Van Damme, who still has a good chance of comeback, judging from his works (such as ""Replicant"") done with Hong Kong film masters.  And fans, do not say this is HIS film.  He has made much, much better films like ""Timecop,"" and we should remember that.",1,"Simply Awful, and Beautiful Laura Elena Harring Is Wasted",1050278400,"04 14, 2003",2003,2482,"['other', 'reviewers', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'watch', 'actress', 'Laura', 'Elena', 'Harring', 'brunette', 'beauty', 'David', 'Lynch', 'cult', 'film', 'Mulholand', 'Drive', 'Naomi', 'Watte', 'had', 'endure', 'long', 'period', 'thankless', 'roles', 'films', 'er', 'Lambada', 'Little', 'Nicky', 'now', 'Academy-Award', 'nominee', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'hit', 'paydirt', 'Ring', 'what', 'Derailed', 'Bad', 'news', 'terribly', 'wasted', 'female', 'thief', 'internationally', 'chased', 'police', 'secret', 'agent', 'Jack', 'sent', 'NATO', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Slovakia', 'send', 'Germany', 'night', 'train', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'night', 'train', 'just', 'forgot', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'airplane', 'never', 'mind', 'reasons', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'comprehend', 'Jack', 'entire', 'family', 'members', 'show', 'up', 'before', 'embarrassed', 'Jack', 'platform', 'including', 'daughter', 'Jessica', 'Bowman', 'Joy', 'Ride', 'son', 'who', 'Jean-Claude', 'real-life', 'son', 'real', 'family', 'name', 'Huuuum.And', 'actions', 'mainly', 'happen', 'train', 'where', 'deadly', 'virus', 'spread', 'can', 'say', 'Siege', '2', 'Cassandra', 'Cross', 'film', 'series', 'very', 'cheesy', 'trashy', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'painful', 'see', 'settings', 'are', 'too', 'incredible', 'bikes', 'train', 'roof', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'little', 'better', 'B', 'monster', 'flicks', 'made', '50s', 'acting', 'dialogues', 'are', 'simply', 'awful', 'last', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'forgiven', 'forgotten', 'only', 'film', 'decent', 'action', 'scenes', 'original', 'ideas', 'such', 'luck', 'here.And', 'Laura', 'Elena', 'Harring', 'can', 'say', 'as', 'beautiful', 'ever', 'even', 'mediocre', 'dialogues', 'poorly', 'shot', 'screen', 'really', 'feel', 'sorry', 'film', 'proof', 'good', 'directors', 'Lynch', 'can', 'induce', 'actors', 'give', 'best', 'rest', 'need', 'say.Like', 'action', 'star', 'Steven', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'skyrocketed', 'stardom', '1990s', 'was', 'then', 'faithful', 'fan', 'OK', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'admit', 'are', 'always', 'entertaining', 'got', 'kind', 'brio', 'only', 'guys', 'can', 'show', 'loved', 'being', 'what', 'were', 'still', 'do', 'now', 'think', 'somebody', 'should', 'stop', 'especially', 'Van', 'Damme', 'who', 'still', 'good', 'chance', 'comeback', 'judging', 'works', 'such', 'Replicant', 'done', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'film', 'masters', 'fans', 'do', 'not', 'say', 'HIS', 'film', 'made', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'Timecop', 'should', 'remember']",Derailed
