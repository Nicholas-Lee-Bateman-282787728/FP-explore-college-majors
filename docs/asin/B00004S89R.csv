This movie gives you a veiw of how deadly, addictive and destructive uncontrolled gambling can be. While I'm not a big John Goodman fan, I must say he played the part of ""Deepthroat"" exceptionally well. In fact, I don't think anyone could have played it as well as he. It was custom made just for him. Ron Eldard did great in his role as a runner and gambling addict, and he and Courtney Cox looked great together. I was disappointed that Joe Matenga's character was killed off so early. Also, Bokeem Woodbine did an excellent job as well.",5,excellent,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,641,"['happened', 'movie', 'other', 'night', 'local', 'pawnshop', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'try', 'movie', 'veiw', 'how', 'deadly', 'addictive', 'destructive', 'uncontrolled', 'gambling', 'can', 'be', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'John', 'Goodman', 'fan', 'must', 'say', 'played', 'part', 'Deepthroat', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'custom', 'made', 'just', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'did', 'great', 'role', 'runner', 'gambling', 'addict', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'looked', 'great', 'together', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Joe', 'Matenga', 'character', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'so', 'early', 'Also', 'Bokeem', 'Woodbine', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'as', 'well']",The Runner

549499,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00004S89R,Michael Butts,"[0, 0]","Meandering around in his warehouse like abode, John Goodman as &quot;Deepthroat&quot; exudes a sedentary and malevolent evil that forms the foundation for this well written, if inconsequential, movie.  Ron Eldard stars as Edward, a man with a gambling addiction, who takes his uncle's (Joe Mantegna) advice to work as a runner for Goodman.  During this time, he meets a waitress named Corinna (played well by Courteney Cox), falls in love and decides to go straight and give up his addiction.  Sorry, Ron.  It doesn't work out that way and before you know it, Eldard is using Goodman's money to gamble and even when he wins $110,000, it's not enough:  he wants more.  Cox gets pregnant, Eldard buys her engagement ring with Goodman's money, and sets up the plot for a dark, disturbing ending.Eldard is exceptional in his role; playing against his boyish good looks, he embodies the frustration, obstinance and greed which forms the basis of most addicts.  Bokeem Woodbine as a fellow runner is smooth and also fundamentally evil; Lucy Lin as a Chinese dealer is marvelous in how she maintains her stoic stance while Eldard keeps losing and betting again.The final scene in the ballpark is unique, and gruesome in its delivery.The problem with the movie, in spite of its technical expertise, is its hollowness.  Eldard while riveting is not sympathetic, and Goodman is so bad, he's tedious.THE RUNNER is a solid, if cerebral, thriller; it just doesn't move you the way I would have liked.",3,GOODMAN IS THE BADMAN,1082851200,"04 25, 2004",2004,1487,"['Meandering', 'around', 'warehouse', 'abode', 'John', 'Goodman', 'quot', 'Deepthroat', 'quot', 'sedentary', 'malevolent', 'evil', 'foundation', 'well', 'written', 'inconsequential', 'movie', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'Edward', 'man', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'who', 'uncle', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'advice', 'work', 'runner', 'Goodman', 'time', 'waitress', 'named', 'Corinna', 'played', 'well', 'Courteney', 'Cox', 'love', 'decides', 'go', 'straight', 'give', 'up', 'addiction', 'Sorry', 'Ron', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'way', 'know', 'Eldard', 'using', 'Goodman', 'money', 'gamble', 'even', 'when', '110,000', 'not', 'enough', 'more', 'Cox', 'pregnant', 'Eldard', 'engagement', 'ring', 'Goodman', 'money', 'up', 'plot', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'ending.Eldard', 'exceptional', 'role', 'playing', 'boyish', 'good', 'looks', 'frustration', 'obstinance', 'greed', 'basis', 'most', 'addicts', 'Bokeem', 'Woodbine', 'fellow', 'runner', 'smooth', 'also', 'fundamentally', 'evil', 'Lucy', 'Lin', 'Chinese', 'dealer', 'marvelous', 'how', 'stoic', 'stance', 'Eldard', 'losing', 'betting', 'again.The', 'final', 'scene', 'ballpark', 'unique', 'gruesome', 'delivery.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'spite', 'technical', 'expertise', 'hollowness', 'Eldard', 'riveting', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'Goodman', 'so', 'bad', 'tedious.THE', 'RUNNER', 'solid', 'cerebral', 'thriller', 'just', ""n't"", 'move', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'liked']",The Runner
