1009170,A2QKQGCSPCUN8,B000H4JH44,Brock Middlebrook,"[3, 4]","Babies love to imitate. Our 11 month old looks at the video with images of other kids crawling, standing up, walking and clapping.  That type of reinforcement will help him figure out how to walk on his own in the near future.  If nothing else it occupies him for 30 minutes...but we really think he is processing what he sees and will imitate the babies in the DVD and thus be walking on his own very soon.",4,Has his attention,1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,407,"['Babies', 'love', 'imitate', '11', 'month', 'old', 'video', 'images', 'other', 'kids', 'crawling', 'standing', 'up', 'walking', 'clapping', 'type', 'reinforcement', 'will', 'help', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'walk', 'own', 'near', 'future', 'nothing', 'else', '30', 'minutes', 'really', 'think', 'processing', 'what', 'will', 'imitate', 'babies', 'DVD', 'thus', 'be', 'walking', 'own', 'very', 'soon']",Baby Einstein - Baby's First Moves

Now that Disney owns the rights, there has been alot of computer graphics and over stimulation that the original movies did not have.

1009174,AD2TAEWQC4PS6,B000H4JH44,"S. Nelson ""Shaina""","[19, 21]","This was a Christmas gift from Santa to my son (7 mos) and myself this year and we've reviewed it a few times and so far it has been educational for both of us. This video exposes infants to basic first moves such has, sitting up, crawling, reaching, etc and to toddlers to basic movements such has, walking and kicking. There are plenty of delightful puppet shows either demonstrating the movement or just to provide something to catch the attention of the viewer (since babies typically have short attention spans...well at least my son does). This particular video features a lot of baby clips with babies aged from 6mos-24mos demonstrating the movements at age appropriateness. My son isn't one for mimicking, so far as I can tell, but it does hold his attention fairly well and he does best when I watch it and do the featured movements with him. There are language features for this video allowing you to watch it in English, Spanish, and French which has been great for us since I speak broken spanish and so far my son does recognize such words as comida (food) and sientate (sit) so in one hand it is a reinforcer for him and a teaching tool for myself as I had forgotten many of the verbs used in reference to baby movement such as camina (walk). Also, in the bonus features there is a short clip with a pilates instructor directed towards mothers to teach us busy women how to get some excercise and playtime in with our children, for this reason alone I would recommend it...it is, however, only like 10 minutes long and only gives you about 10 tips but those 10 tips to someone like myself can be a lifesaver (I didn't know how to properly pick up a carrier with a baby in it before I saw this!). I highly recommend this video for the obvious reasons but if it doesn't sound like something for you don't get it because from what I can tell, you either hate it or you love it.",5,Great Learning and Interactive Tool for parents and Infants,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,1888,"['was', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'Santa', 'son', '7', 'mos', 'year', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'few', 'times', 'so', 'far', 'been', 'educational', 'video', 'infants', 'basic', 'first', 'moves', 'such', 'sitting', 'up', 'crawling', 'reaching', 'etc', 'toddlers', 'basic', 'movements', 'such', 'walking', 'kicking', 'are', 'plenty', 'delightful', 'puppet', 'demonstrating', 'movement', 'just', 'provide', 'something', 'catch', 'attention', 'viewer', 'babies', 'typically', 'have', 'short', 'attention', 'spans', 'well', 'least', 'son', 'particular', 'video', 'lot', 'baby', 'clips', 'babies', 'aged', '6mos-24mos', 'demonstrating', 'movements', 'age', 'appropriateness', 'son', ""n't"", 'one', 'mimicking', 'so', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'hold', 'attention', 'fairly', 'well', 'best', 'when', 'watch', 'do', 'featured', 'movements', 'are', 'language', 'features', 'video', 'allowing', 'watch', 'English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'been', 'great', 'speak', 'broken', 'spanish', 'so', 'far', 'son', 'recognize', 'such', 'words', 'comida', 'food', 'sientate', 'sit', 'so', 'one', 'hand', 'reinforcer', 'teaching', 'tool', 'had', 'forgotten', 'many', 'verbs', 'used', 'reference', 'baby', 'movement', 'such', 'camina', 'walk', 'Also', 'bonus', 'features', 'short', 'clip', 'pilates', 'instructor', 'directed', 'towards', 'mothers', 'teach', 'busy', 'women', 'how', 'get', 'excercise', 'playtime', 'children', 'reason', 'alone', 'would', 'recommend', 'however', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'only', '10', 'tips', '10', 'tips', 'someone', 'can', 'be', 'lifesaver', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'properly', 'pick', 'up', 'carrier', 'baby', 'saw', 'highly', 'recommend', 'video', 'obvious', 'reasons', ""n't"", 'sound', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'either', 'hate', 'love']",Baby Einstein - Baby's First Moves
