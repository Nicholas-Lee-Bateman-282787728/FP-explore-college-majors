Also Tess gets her car. The 100th episode is very emotional about a boy with cystic fibrosis who has a list that he wants to complete before he dies. Also he wants his mom to be cared for.,5,First and 100th episode,1330387200,"02 28, 2012",2012,351,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'how', 'series', 'started', 'out', 'Monica', 'assigned', 'child', 'finding', 'mother', 'more', 'important', 'almost', 'case', 'Also', 'Tess', 'car', '100th', 'episode', 'very', 'emotional', 'boy', 'cystic', 'fibrosis', 'who', 'list', 'complete', 'Also', 'mom', 'be', 'cared']",N/A

Special guest Wynonna gives a beautifully  heart-wrenching performance as a mother of a dying child. After this, maybe  Ashley won't be the only acting judd in the house. Ben Cross, of the film  &quot;Wide Awake&quot;, gives another splendid performance, and of course,  roma downey &amp; della reese give their usual angelic displays.But the one  who always seems to be forgotten, is given a prime example of his  extroidinary prescence. John Dye, who plays the angel Andrew, is  spotlighted quite a bit in this episode, and for those, who in the past,  have ignored his contribution, you won't ever again. his performance alone  will have you cryin'. But make sure to bring along a couple of extra boxes  of tissues, because the writing is so beautiful, and the directing is so  magnificant, with subtle moments that are so poignant, you will be just a  ball of wet by the end. The sayng &quot;less-is-more&quot; is often ignored  in hollywood, as well as in life. But once you've been  &quot;touched&quot;...",5,a very touching episode...,923443200,"04 7, 1999",1999,1338,"['quot', 'touched', 'angel', 'quot', 'was', 'so', 'aptly', 'named', 'show', 'more', 'television', 'history', 'touched', 'so', 'many', 'lives', '100th', 'episode', 'exception', 'quot', '151', 'quot', 'one', 'finest', 'moments', 'television', 'history', 'i', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'producers', 'had', 'wisdom', 'release', 'video', 'Special', 'guest', 'Wynonna', 'beautifully', 'heart-wrenching', 'performance', 'mother', 'dying', 'child', 'maybe', 'Ashley', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'only', 'acting', 'judd', 'house', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'film', 'quot', 'Wide', 'Awake', 'quot', 'splendid', 'performance', 'course', 'roma', 'downey', 'amp', 'della', 'reese', 'give', 'usual', 'angelic', 'displays.But', 'one', 'who', 'always', 'be', 'forgotten', 'given', 'prime', 'example', 'extroidinary', 'prescence', 'John', 'Dye', 'who', 'angel', 'Andrew', 'spotlighted', 'quite', 'bit', 'episode', 'who', 'past', 'have', 'ignored', 'contribution', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'again', 'performance', 'alone', 'will', 'have', 'cryin', 'make', 'sure', 'bring', 'along', 'couple', 'extra', 'boxes', 'tissues', 'writing', 'so', 'beautiful', 'directing', 'so', 'magnificant', 'subtle', 'moments', 'are', 'so', 'poignant', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'ball', 'wet', 'end', 'sayng', 'quot', 'less-is-more', 'quot', 'often', 'ignored', 'hollywood', 'as', 'well', 'life', 'once', ""'ve"", 'been', 'quot', 'touched', 'quot']",N/A
460009,A120XZHOP8XW6I,6305320705,William Taylor,"[0, 0]",What can I say about this?  Psalm 151 happens to be my favorite episode.  It is funny and sad at times.  It is also filled with uplifting music (a.k.a. &quot;Testify To Love and &quot;Love Can Move Mountains&quot;.)  &quot;Southbound Bus&quot; is also a good starting episode especially for  those who had never seen the TV show before.  Also a great edition is the  CD of &quot;Touched By An Angel.&quot;,5,Uplifting and Inspirational,958694400,"05 19, 2000",2000,405,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'Psalm', '151', 'be', 'favorite', 'episode', 'funny', 'sad', 'times', 'also', 'filled', 'uplifting', 'music', 'a.k.a', 'quot', 'Testify', 'Love', 'quot', 'Love', 'Can', 'Move', 'Mountains', 'quot', 'quot', 'Southbound', 'Bus', 'quot', 'also', 'good', 'starting', 'episode', 'especially', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'TV', 'show', 'Also', 'great', 'edition', 'CD', 'quot', 'Touched', 'Angel.', 'quot']",N/A
