1015045,A3NOBH42C7UI5M,B000HKCSYY,"Amazon Customer ""kepela""","[0, 0]","I watch it with my 4 month old grandson. He loves seeing the little children and babies on TV and he watches pretty intently for about 1/2 the video; pretty normal at this age, I think. When it show a sign for something, like a shoe, it says the word, shows shoes and kids playing with shoes, as well as everyone signing the word shoe. So it doesn't only teach sign, it actually teaches vocabulary. Personally, I love it for me. I'd been wanting to take classes to learn sign and these are easy and fun. I highly recommend it, and the other signing times videos to the whole family. They're short, only about half hour, so no time to get bored. They are very easy to follow and understand.",5,"Great for adults too, I love it.",1176768000,"04 17, 2007",2007,689,"['watch', '4', 'month', 'old', 'grandson', 'seeing', 'little', 'children', 'babies', 'TV', 'pretty', 'intently', 'about', '1/2', 'video', 'pretty', 'normal', 'age', 'think', 'When', 'show', 'sign', 'something', 'shoe', 'word', 'shoes', 'kids', 'playing', 'shoes', 'as', 'well', 'everyone', 'signing', 'word', 'shoe', ""n't"", 'only', 'teach', 'sign', 'actually', 'vocabulary', 'Personally', 'love', ""'d"", 'been', 'wanting', 'take', 'classes', 'learn', 'sign', 'are', 'easy', 'fun', 'highly', 'recommend', 'other', 'signing', 'times', 'videos', 'whole', 'family', ""'re"", 'short', 'only', 'half', 'hour', 'time', 'get', 'bored', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'understand']",N/A

He would ask to watch it every day.  The singer, Rachel, is wonderful!  I love her voice, I love the songs, and I love the quality of the dvd in general.

The Signing Time Story is inspirational, the videos are educational and fun.  I enjoyed using them with my 3rd and 4th babies, but the older kids liked them too and they helped all of us (and grandma) learn how to sign with our little ones.  My 3rd child could sign 60+ words before she could speak - what an amazing window into her little world that I might not otherwise have had.  I also love the the videos show children of all abilities.  Great series - 3 and 4 came along too late for us to use with little ones, but if I had a older baby/toddler, I would definitely be interested.",5,Love this DVD and the whole series!,1303171200,"04 19, 2011",2011,715,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'several', 'years', 'own', 'vol', '1', '2', 'other', 'signing', 'time', 'own', 'are', 'most', 'played', 'Signing', 'Time', 'Story', 'inspirational', 'videos', 'are', 'educational', 'fun', 'enjoyed', 'using', '3rd', '4th', 'babies', 'older', 'kids', 'liked', 'too', 'helped', 'grandma', 'learn', 'how', 'sign', 'little', 'ones', '3rd', 'child', 'could', 'sign', '60+', 'words', 'could', 'speak', 'what', 'amazing', 'window', 'little', 'world', 'might', 'not', 'otherwise', 'have', 'had', 'also', 'love', 'videos', 'show', 'children', 'abilities', 'Great', 'series', '3', '4', 'came', 'along', 'too', 'late', 'use', 'little', 'ones', 'had', 'older', 'baby/toddler', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'interested']",N/A
