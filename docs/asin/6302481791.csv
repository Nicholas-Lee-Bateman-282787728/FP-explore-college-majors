However, I put off watching this DVD because here in the U.S. it was released as a 1.33:1 pan and scan picture, a far cry from it's theater release of 2.35:1.  This means you're only seeing about 1/2 to 2/3 of the original frame of the movie.  And, if you're like me and have a widescreen set up, it looks even worse.  There is a solution if you're a serious fan.  A digitally remastered DVD of Snowy River I and II with the origianl aspect ratio 2.35:1 and glorious Dolby 5.1 and DTS 5.1 soundtracks were released (together in one package) in Australia.  They are region 4 DVDs and PAL to boot, but if you have a region free dvd player or can convert yours to region free (I have the Oppo 971H and it was a snap) then you can find these movies from sellers in Australia (fleabay or other places) and see them as they were meant to be seen.  In fact, Geoff Burrowes who produced them both, includes on Snowy River II the wedding scene between Jim and Jess that was cut from the theatrical release at the very last second.  He says it was the way the movie was meant to end, and is the way it's shown here (the shorter ending that was actually released is on the special features menu, so you can see both).  I don't know if the wedding is on the dvd released in the U.S. since I refused to watch it.  What a great story these 2 movies share!!

Twenty five years ago, I stood in line at midnight waiting for the first viewing of this film and unlike other sequels, was not disappointed!  Not all sequels can live up to the original but I fell in love with this movie as I did it's predecessor.  It's a movie that I watch regularly.  The soundscore, the cinematography and even the continuation of the story of Jim and Jessica was believable and engaging.  Even deeper than that, the development of these two characters continues as well.  Jim though still strong and forthright, continues to learn the value of fighting for what is right, even when it requires a heavy price.  Jessica, though still full of stubbornness and spunk, is faced with choosing between to men that she loves.  She learns the value of being respected for what you are and not who you are!  Again, a worthy continuation!My only negatives about this film has more to do with it's final editing and DVD production.  With editing it's more with the scenes they chose to delete in the American version of the film.  To be precise, the exclusion of the wedding scene.  Imagine my disappointment when a dear Australian friend told me that their version included this scene and most likely a few others.  Thankfully, I found it posted on YouTube (I don't think it's still there though).  My second negative is that Disney chose to only release the DVD in full screen mode.  The cinematography in this movie is breathtaking and to have to view it in ""full screen"" mode is a great injustice to the brilliance of the filming.Still all in all, I can not recommend this movie enough.

314869,AQDI602797FSF,6302481791,Maigray,"[16, 16]","This is one of those soaring, melodramatic epics, set as a sequel to the classic film ""The Man From Snowy River.""  It's a typical action-adventure love story, laden with turgid emotional scenes, where the hero gets plenty of triumphal moments and everybody gets what they deserve in the end.The movie is set apart from most by its stunt work, cinematography, scoring, top notch actors and classy style of filming.  This movie is also suitable as family entertainment, though this in no way takes away from its overall quality.Plot wise, there are several engaging storylines, well knitted together and leading to a thrilling climax.Fans of the first film should also be pleased to see the return of the prize colt, who Jim and Jessica trained in the first film, making his racing debut.This film seems to be frequently overshadowed by its predecessor.  But I think it's a more polished product; the actors look better, the editing is smoother, the stunts are more daring, the cinematography is more expansive.  It come across as a more mature film overall, which is really what it's supposed to be.The cinematography is notably fabulous, and the dramatically flighted score matches it perfectly.  Many prefer Mr. Douglas in the first film, but I thought Brian Dennehy did the role a lot of justice.The social commentary implicit in some of the storylines can get a bit heavy-handed.  Some of the characters are saved from being too stereotypical only by the skin of their scripts and some good acting.  There are times when the dialogue skates the edge of cheesiness or the plot line takes a turn into improbability.  But the overall strength of the acting and filming always manages to pull it through.This film is especially noted for its stunt work with horses.  As a rider and horse lover myself, I've seen pretty much every horse movie out there and 99% of them just can't pull it off.  The action in this one is just mind blowing, very realistic and filmed with incredible intensity.  Even better, all the horses are gorgeous and the main actors are fabulous riders, who you actually get to see doing most of their own riding stunts.  In my mind, it still sets the standard for horseriding action in film.Overall, this is a great old fashioned drama, and a wonderful experience on film.Notes:The internet fosters some reaaallllly wild ideas.The movie ""The Man From Snowy River"" is based on the famous poem of the same name, by Banjo Patterson, considered to be a national treasure in Australia.Several other reviews have mentioned the idea that a horse died onset.  The rumor is specifically concerned with one scene, where a horse named ""Denny"" (please note this is the name of the character's horse and not the real horse - you can confirm it with subtitles) is shown falling down the side of a mountain.Being an avid horse lover, I spent some hard hours ferreting out the source and veracity of the rumor.A check at the American Humane Association's online ratings site revealed a review for ""Return to Snowy River,"" which rated the movie as ""Unacceptable."" But the review had several inconsistencies, which I contacted them about directly (they're very prompt in answering emails).It stated only that they had received a report from Australia that a horse had died on set; no further contact was ever made and the report remains unconfirmed.The problem is that AHA does not monitor films made in foreign countries, nor do they accept ratings from foreign animal welfare agencies.  So the the film should be listed as ""Not Monitored.""  In sum, the rating appears to have no legitimacy based on their own rules.Further research yielded the fact that the Lovicks, who were responsible for supplying all the horses for the film, will confirm they owned the main horse actor who played ""Denny"" up until his death and that no horses died onset.  They have a website you can contact them through.Finally, there seems to be an underlying confusion as to how horses are actually used in film.  The main animal ""actor"" in any film has multiple doubles for handling the work.  I myself counted at least 3 different ""Dennys,"" which an experienced eye can easily pick out.  In movies, there are special stunt horses trained to ""fall"" for any scene where a horse goes down.

After a few years trying to earn money to marry Jessica Harrison (Sigrid Thornton), Jim Craig (Tom Burlinson) returns to Snowy River. But he finds that a lot of things have changed. The succesful ranchers and bankers want to buy up all of the land of the beautiful Australian mountains where he was brought up. He also finds that Jessica's father, Harrison (Brian Dennehy) wants her to marry Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie), son of landowner Patton Sr. (Rhys McConnochie). With a sort of silent feud between the landowners and the mountain men going on, Jim and Jessica must decide if they're love is worth firing up the feud even worse.As most of the cases, I prefer the first movie to &quot;Return to Snowy River&quot; though I think they both deserve 5 stars. One of the reasons is I enjoy the first one more is that Kirk Douglas played Harrison in the first movie. Yes, Brian Dennehy was superb in that role, I still like Kirk Douglas.All right, to the fine parts of the movie. Beautiful and magnificent scenery of the Australian mountains! Excellent acting by all actors and actresses, the suspense, action, and adventure will keep you on the edge of your seats! And Tom Burlinson sure know how to ride when he performs some pretty cool stunts while riding horses. Especially the earlier part of the movie where he proves that he can certainly ride better than Nicholas Eadie who plays the part of the jealous bad guy for Jessica's affection.I recommend this movie along with the first movie, &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot;.

Jessica Harrison (Sigrid Thornton) has never quite gotten over Jim Craig/The Man from Snowy River (Tom Burlinson). In the first movie, he promises to come back for what is his.When he does return, the scenery has changed. The high country hasn't changed as much as the people have changed.Jessica's father (Brian Dennehy) wants her to marry Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie). When she sees Jim for the first time since his return, one of the first things she wants to know is why it has taken him so long to return. It seems he has been trying to prove his worth to her by raising horses and trying to make a future for them both.At first it seems Jessica is going to follow the wishes of her father, yet we know that she has quite the mind of her own and when Jim asks: ""What do you want?"" Jessica replies: ""I want you."" She doesn't have to think twice because her heart is free. Together Jim and Jessica are really like two wild horses at heart. They don't want to be tied down to the life everyone else has determined for them.Jessica has always been judged for who she is and not for what she is. Her heart can only be tamed by Jim Craig and she is even willing to give up everything she holds dear to make him happy. Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie) holds her attention briefly, but the minute she sees Jim you know she hasn't forgotten him as he is the only man who truly knows how she feels about life and love. Alistair turns out to be vindictive and cruel. He not only wants Jessica, he wants to destroy Jim.This sequel has way more action scenes that are even more spectacular than the first movie although a bit less artistic in places. I still love the scene in the first movie where the horses run through the snow. In this movie, there are gorgeous scenes of horses swimming through rivers and running across the Australian mountains. Quite frankly, it is all quite stunning and the sheer power of the horses can be felt throughout the scenes.The black stallion plays a significant role in either destroying or healing situations to the point you can't decide if you like him or not. It is as if everything he does causes some extreme situation.It is highly recommended that you watch the first: ""The Man from Snowy River"" because they don't repeat information that would make the background behind the feuds much more clear.When two souls are destined to find one another, they do. Jim and Jessica seem to be able to weather any storm that comes their way, even when the future looks very bleak.After all, life is an adventure to be lived to the fullest and sometimes you have to set someone free from your heart to see if they will one day come back.~The Rebecca Review",5,The love story continues...,1014076800,"02 19, 2002",2002,2729,"['are', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget', 'Jessica', 'Harrison', 'Sigrid', 'Thornton', 'never', 'quite', 'gotten', 'over', 'Jim', 'Craig/The', 'Man', 'Snowy', 'River', 'Tom', 'Burlinson', 'first', 'movie', 'come', 'back', 'what', 'his.When', 'return', 'scenery', 'changed', 'high', 'country', ""n't"", 'changed', 'as', 'much', 'people', 'have', 'changed.Jessica', 'father', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'marry', 'Alistair', 'Patton', 'Nicholas', 'Eadie', 'When', 'Jim', 'first', 'time', 'return', 'one', 'first', 'things', 'know', 'why', 'taken', 'so', 'long', 'return', 'been', 'trying', 'prove', 'worth', 'raising', 'horses', 'trying', 'make', 'future', 'both.At', 'first', 'Jessica', 'going', 'follow', 'wishes', 'father', 'yet', 'know', 'quite', 'mind', 'own', 'when', 'Jim', 'What', 'do', 'want', 'Jessica', 'replies', 'want', ""n't"", 'have', 'think', 'twice', 'heart', 'free', 'Jim', 'Jessica', 'are', 'really', 'two', 'wild', 'horses', 'heart', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'tied', 'life', 'everyone', 'else', 'determined', 'them.Jessica', 'always', 'been', 'judged', 'who', 'not', 'what', 'heart', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'tamed', 'Jim', 'Craig', 'even', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'everything', 'dear', 'make', 'happy', 'Alistair', 'Patton', 'Nicholas', 'Eadie', 'attention', 'briefly', 'minute', 'Jim', 'know', ""n't"", 'forgotten', 'only', 'man', 'who', 'truly', 'how', 'life', 'love', 'Alistair', 'out', 'be', 'vindictive', 'cruel', 'not', 'only', 'Jessica', 'destroy', 'Jim.This', 'sequel', 'way', 'more', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'spectacular', 'first', 'movie', 'bit', 'less', 'artistic', 'places', 'still', 'love', 'scene', 'first', 'movie', 'where', 'horses', 'run', 'snow', 'movie', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'scenes', 'horses', 'swimming', 'rivers', 'running', 'Australian', 'mountains', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'quite', 'stunning', 'sheer', 'power', 'horses', 'can', 'be', 'felt', 'scenes.The', 'black', 'stallion', 'significant', 'role', 'destroying', 'healing', 'situations', 'point', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'like', 'not', 'everything', 'extreme', 'situation.It', 'highly', 'recommended', 'watch', 'first', 'Man', 'Snowy', 'River', 'do', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'information', 'would', 'make', 'background', 'feuds', 'much', 'more', 'clear.When', 'two', 'souls', 'are', 'destined', 'find', 'one', 'do', 'Jim', 'Jessica', 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'weather', 'storm', 'way', 'even', 'when', 'future', 'very', 'bleak.After', 'life', 'adventure', 'be', 'lived', 'fullest', 'sometimes', 'have', 'set', 'someone', 'free', 'heart', 'see', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'come', 'back.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Return to Snowy River VHS

Also some details from the first movie were forgotten, such as the fact that Jim Craig owned his father's half share in the mine.
