There are only two movies in which he plays the part of the good guy, to commendable effect and great martial arts choreography, namely Iron Monkey and Champions, both of which I consider to be two of the greatest martial arts movies ever made, and both of which are considered to be his best movies to date. He doesn't perform to the high standards he has established for himself in this movie but, nevertheless puts in a commendable performance, only to be out shined by other less known actors, particularly the female cast.All in all, a rather satisfying and good martial arts movie.",4,Fantastic Yu Rongguang Flick,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,1011,"['one', 'better', 'wushu', 'flicks', 'Yu', 'Rongguang', 'whom', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'martial', 'arts', 'practitioner', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'great', 'athlete', 'boot', 'greatly', 'used', 'actor', 'given', 'fact', 'continually', 'bad', 'guy', 'genre', 'thereby', 'misleading', 'Asian', 'audience', 'misidentifying', 'role', 'hence', 'rendered', 'quite', 'unpopular', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'movies', 'part', 'good', 'guy', 'commendable', 'effect', 'great', 'martial', 'arts', 'choreography', 'namely', 'Iron', 'Monkey', 'Champions', 'consider', 'be', 'two', 'greatest', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'are', 'considered', 'be', 'best', 'movies', 'date', ""n't"", 'perform', 'high', 'standards', 'established', 'movie', 'nevertheless', 'commendable', 'performance', 'only', 'be', 'out', 'shined', 'other', 'less', 'known', 'actors', 'particularly', 'female', 'cast.All', 'rather', 'satisfying', 'good', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie']",Shaolin & Wu Tang 2 VHS

In the setting for the language it didn't let me prompt it to play audio for english.  The setting was there but it didn't work and that to me was disappointing.  For this was a great movie audio is really important we don't speak the language.  The setting for subtitle work fine.  I have to call you on this one not happy with that defect.,2,Shaolin & Wu Tang 2- Wu Tang Invasion,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,432,"['Well', 'starter', 'i', 'had', 'movie', 'VHS', 'i', 'loved', 'only', 'problem', 'movie', 'setting', 'language', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'prompt', 'play', 'audio', 'english', 'setting', 'was', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'disappointing', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'audio', 'really', 'important', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'language', 'setting', 'subtitle', 'work', 'fine', 'have', 'call', 'one', 'not', 'happy', 'defect']",Shaolin & Wu Tang 2 VHS

And I;m not talking abou using his hands, he does THE hardest hits and springs on his back I have ever.  Unfortunately the movie is not a good one even for kung fu terms.  And that guy I was just talking about, that's like his only part.  But there is a monk named yu nan I think and this guy can really fight.  He is small and has a single expression he shows on his face.  I don't have any idea who this guy is but I would think he was in at least a couple other mainland films.OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU IRON MONKEY IS IN THIS.  This must be his first movie and his fighting skills aren't polished by any means.  He has always been an underused actor as the years have progressed but man do they show him off in this one.  Now his fights are unpolished, but like jet in shaolin temple, he is a serious athlete.  Meaining that even a guy like allen iverson would have respect for him.  And speaking of allen, EVERYONE in this movie had ot have broken a couple of bones.  The final kick of the movie by yu nan and iron monkey is spectacular but still doesn't look worth the pain the actors went through.  Then iron monkey takes a shot at least twice as hard in the next shot and that was all by himself.  I seriously thought he must have died in real life.  And the hordst stunts are the sheeit.  Dangerous stuff always going on in this movie, no story, but the fights are plentiful and VERY good.  VERY VERY GOOOOODOOD.The Xenon version is nicely widescreened, but suffers from a very worn out and faded picture.  I like the cantonese track but the subs are very difficult to read and decipher when you can read them.  But don't worry, it's iron monkey beating everyone's ass.",4,"one hell of a fighting movie, not a good story or nothing, but some sick ass fights",1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,1830,"['am', 'talking', 'monk', 'training', 'who', 'back', 'AS', 'HARD', 'HE', 'CAN', 'ON', 'THE', 'DIRT', 'GROUND', 'AND', 'SPRING', 'BACK', 'UP', 'EVERY', 'TIME', 'HIGHER', 'AND', 'HIGHER', 'not', 'talking', 'using', 'hands', 'THE', 'hardest', 'hits', 'springs', 'back', 'have', 'ever', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'not', 'good', 'one', 'even', 'kung', 'fu', 'terms', 'guy', 'was', 'just', 'talking', 'only', 'part', 'monk', 'named', 'nan', 'think', 'guy', 'can', 'really', 'fight', 'small', 'single', 'expression', 'face', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'guy', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'least', 'couple', 'other', 'mainland', 'films.OH', 'YEAH', 'FORGOT', 'TO', 'TELL', 'YOU', 'IRON', 'MONKEY', 'IS', 'IN', 'THIS', 'must', 'be', 'first', 'movie', 'fighting', 'skills', 'are', ""n't"", 'polished', 'means', 'always', 'been', 'underused', 'actor', 'years', 'have', 'progressed', 'man', 'do', 'show', 'off', 'one', 'Now', 'fights', 'are', 'unpolished', 'jet', 'shaolin', 'temple', 'serious', 'athlete', 'Meaining', 'even', 'guy', 'allen', 'iverson', 'would', 'have', 'respect', 'speaking', 'allen', 'EVERYONE', 'movie', 'had', 'ot', 'have', 'broken', 'couple', 'bones', 'final', 'kick', 'movie', 'yu', 'nan', 'iron', 'monkey', 'spectacular', 'still', ""n't"", 'look', 'pain', 'actors', 'went', 'Then', 'iron', 'monkey', 'shot', 'least', 'twice', 'as', 'hard', 'next', 'shot', 'was', 'seriously', 'thought', 'must', 'have', 'died', 'real', 'life', 'hordst', 'stunts', 'are', 'sheeit', 'Dangerous', 'stuff', 'always', 'going', 'movie', 'story', 'fights', 'are', 'plentiful', 'VERY', 'good', 'VERY', 'VERY', 'GOOOOODOOD.The', 'Xenon', 'version', 'nicely', 'widescreened', 'suffers', 'very', 'worn', 'faded', 'picture', 'cantonese', 'track', 'subs', 'are', 'very', 'difficult', 'read', 'decipher', 'when', 'can', 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'iron', 'monkey', 'beating', 'everyone', 'ass']",Shaolin & Wu Tang 2 VHS
