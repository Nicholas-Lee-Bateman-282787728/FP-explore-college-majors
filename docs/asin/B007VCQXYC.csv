The storytelling is fantastic, definitely for book lovers and movie lovers. Absolutely no unnecessary bathroom scene. In almost all the films I've seen in these recent years, for some strange reason, filmmakers have chosen to include bathroom scenes where some character is sitting on a toilet. From kids films to every other rating, they've slipped these in, but it doesn't amuse me in the least, nor does it add any value to any movie.

1538684,AYG1U47VFZ165,B007VCQXYC,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[7, 10]","I knew that I'd recognized the face, name, and voice of Luke Goss, star of INTERVIEW WITH A HITMAN.  As much as I tried, I couldn't place it.  At first, I mistaken thought he was Jason Lewis, the young stud who romanced Samantha throughout the last season of (dare I say it?) HBO's ""Sex and the City,"" but, were that the case, we would've had to have slimmed down a bit and lost some hair.  After the flick ended, I quickly went over to IMDB and searched, and only then did it come to me.  That's because when I'd last seen him (twice), he was under so many layers of make-up (in BLADE 2 and HELLBOY 2: THE GOLDEN ARMY) that his own mother probably wouldn't have known who he was.  Goss has built up an impressive resume in some second-tier direct-to-DVD action pictures - think of him as a budget Jason Statham - of which INTERVIEW WITH A HITMAN might push him into mainstream status if more people discover it.(NOTE: The following review may contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Viktor (the aforementioned Goss) has finally decided to come clean, to tell his story to an aging motion picture director who's hoping for one more great shot at producing an unforgettable documentary about organized crime.  With no reservations, Viktor tells all - how he got his start on the streets of Romania, how he was `discovered' by the organization, how he went on the run and made himself part of a new syndicate when things turned dark - and he's not afraid to name names and bring secrets to life.  However, when all is done and over, audiences might be left questioning just whose story the stealthy hitman was bringing to life, because not all secrets can be hidden or forgotten with a bullet.For the record, this is writer/director Perry Bhandal's first film, and, on most counts, it's very impressive.  He's assembled a largely unknown (or unheard of) cast to tell this story of a hitman whose heart may or may not be in the right place, and he's populated it with mostly believable circumstances and situations.  Goss - as mentioned - is a particularly strong, charismatic lead, who clearly puts all of himself into even the quieter moments of exploring a life of crime.  Caroline Tillette - she plays the mysterious `Bethesda,' a contract kill Viktor refuses to carry out - brings modest depth to a role that never quite emerges from the shadows; her character has a purpose, but - once audiences know what it is - it'll possibly stretch the bounds of believability to their necessary limits.  It's far from perfect, but, for what's needed, it works just fine.Still, what others have embraced as ""a dark and complex tale"" works only seventy percent of the time, largely due to the fact that the script could've used some polish in the Logic Department.  I won't trouble you with all of the unanswered questions because to do so would spoil much of the story that develops, but I'll caution you to watch the criminal organizations very closely: how far would their legitimate reaches stretch, and, if they stretched as far as the story implies, why is it no one openly recognized our two leads a bit more frequently than they did?Plus, there are some curious edits that Bhandal employed that, by their nature, imply a passage of time when, in fact, no time (or no legitimately length of time) passed.  This happens a few times in the picture, and that leads me to believe that it was a stylistic choice made by the director and not an error in the production process.  Yes, I realize that it's a minor quibble, but it's one that detracted from my enjoyment of the film when it shouldn't have - I'm comfortable chalking it up to the lessons that'll be learned of a first-time director.It's a great start to Bhandal's career, as well as being another great feather in Goss's cap.  Audiences would be wise to watch what develops with both of these emerging forces, as I'd suspect there are good things in store for their respective futures.INTERVIEW WITH A HITMAN is produced by Kirlian Pictures, Scanner-Rhodes Productions, Northern Film and Media, and Northstar Ventures.  DVD distribution is being handled by Well Go USA.  Only for purposes of clarity will I mention that, despite this taking place in several foreign countries, English is the spoken language throughout the picture.  As for the technical specifications, the film looks very solid, but I have to point out that some of the mike work was just awful; much of the story unfolds in a hotel room (where Viktor narrates his story) or very large warehouse environments, and a more accomplished sound technician could've added enormous worth here as some of the recorded tracks are a bit garbled or hard-to-hear.  To compensate, I cranked up the volume and turned on the English subtitles (there are a couple really obvious misspelled words there, too), and that helped mostly.  Lastly, there's a short (15 minute) `making of' featurette as well as the theatrical trailer for those interested.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Not every decision that's made in independent film production is the right one, but there's plenty to be excited about if you're (A) drawn to indie pictures, (B) are a fan of Luke Goss, (C) can appreciate a good femme fatale when you see one, and (D) like your film noir best served up hard-boiled.  If that's the case, you're likely to have as grand a time as I did with INTERVIEW WITH A HITMAN despite some quirky shortcomings that probably was the result of this being writer/director Perry Bhandal's first picture.  I'm told forgiveness is divine; try telling that to these characters, and don't mind the bullet in the arse as you run out the door.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA provided me with an advance DVD screener of INTERVIEW WITH A HITMAN by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,INTERVIEW Produces A Modest 'Hit' Though It

This movie, in my opinion, was the very best I have seen since ""The Mechanic "" with Charles Bronson! It is not Hollywood styalized like ""Hitman"", which I enjoyed. Instead you get a brutal real life type hitman. The pace is fast and vicious. You have to pay attention all the time. If you leave the room for an instant, or if someone engages you in brief conversation, by all means put the movie on ""pause"". Or, you will find yourself reversing alot. They speak english, but with eastern Europe type accents, so you have to listen closely. Things happen fast, once the movie gets going. This is the type of hitman movie I've waited for,  for a long time. Luke Goss does a great job, and now he is my #1 male hitman actor , period. My #1 female hitman actress , is Janet Mcteer, from ""Cat Run"". I would love to see both these people in a movie together as a hit-team, husband and wife duo. Not much gore in this movie.

But together they crafted a very tight and focused thriller in IWAH that belies its low budget and does most everything right.The script moves well and despite various flashback timeslips it all hangs together nicely. The kid playing the young Viktor is frighteningly believable, as is Goss. This is one of those films where I feel like I saw a different movie from most reviewers; I thought almost everything worked well, from the bit players to the moody cinematography to the exceptional score.Dan Teicher deserves special mention for that score. It reminded me of some of the best thriller scores, especially Tangerine Dream's Thief, with touches of Hans Zimmer and Jerry Goldsmith thrown in. The first third of the movie is largely free of dialogue and the music creates a perfect tapestry for the plot to play out against. There's some wonderfully weird guitar and synth passages and all in all it's one of the best action scores I've heard since The Dark Knight.The lighting and locations also work beautifully; Newcastle never looked so good, nor like so many other places. And while all the accents aren't always perfect, they work well enough and I preferred them to tons of subtitles during the Romanian sequences. Above all I enjoyed the compositions and lack of pointless camera movement; Bandhal knew what he wanted from every shot and got it with a minimum of fuss. Economy in almost every aspect is what I enjoyed most about this film, and the way he develops Goss' character so subtly is what makes it all flow so well.There's no shortage of hits, and they're all done with grim accuracy. But none of the violence feels sensational, and its matter of fact presentation highlights the basic theme: a truly world-class hitman can never afford to really have feelings. Yet Goss quietly imbues his role with plenty of feeling simmering beneath the surface, and that's what keeps this flick ticking.I loved this film and think it will age very well, and will one day be seen as among the finest of all the assassin films, easily up there with Jackal and other genre classics. Hitman is proof that great action films can be made with a small budget and that you don't need to blow a ton of stuff up to make a good action film.",5,"Taut, character driven thriller with a very cool TanDreamish score",1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,2365,"['4.6', 'starsThis', 'was', 'real', 'surprise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'Goss', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'writer/director', 'Bhandal', 'together', 'crafted', 'very', 'tight', 'focused', 'thriller', 'IWAH', 'low', 'budget', 'most', 'everything', 'right.The', 'script', 'moves', 'well', 'various', 'flashback', 'timeslips', 'together', 'nicely', 'kid', 'playing', 'young', 'Viktor', 'frighteningly', 'believable', 'Goss', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'feel', 'saw', 'different', 'movie', 'most', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'almost', 'everything', 'worked', 'well', 'bit', 'players', 'moody', 'cinematography', 'exceptional', 'score.Dan', 'Teicher', 'special', 'mention', 'score', 'reminded', 'best', 'thriller', 'scores', 'especially', 'Tangerine', 'Dream', 'Thief', 'touches', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'thrown', 'first', 'third', 'movie', 'largely', 'free', 'dialogue', 'music', 'perfect', 'tapestry', 'plot', 'play', 'out', 'wonderfully', 'weird', 'guitar', 'synth', 'passages', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'scores', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Dark', 'Knight.The', 'lighting', 'locations', 'also', 'work', 'beautifully', 'Newcastle', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'places', 'accents', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'perfect', 'work', 'well', 'enough', 'preferred', 'tons', 'subtitles', 'Romanian', 'sequences', 'enjoyed', 'compositions', 'lack', 'pointless', 'camera', 'movement', 'Bandhal', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'shot', 'got', 'minimum', 'fuss', 'Economy', 'almost', 'aspect', 'what', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'film', 'way', 'Goss', 'character', 'so', 'subtly', 'what', 'flow', 'so', 'shortage', 'hits', ""'re"", 'done', 'grim', 'accuracy', 'none', 'violence', 'feels', 'sensational', 'matter', 'fact', 'presentation', 'basic', 'theme', 'truly', 'world-class', 'hitman', 'can', 'never', 'afford', 'really', 'have', 'feelings', 'Goss', 'quietly', 'role', 'plenty', 'feeling', 'simmering', 'surface', 'what', 'flick', 'ticking.I', 'loved', 'film', 'think', 'will', 'age', 'very', 'well', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'seen', 'finest', 'assassin', 'films', 'easily', 'there', 'Jackal', 'other', 'genre', 'classics', 'Hitman', 'proof', 'great', 'action', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'small', 'budget', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'blow', 'ton', 'stuff', 'make', 'good', 'action', 'film']",N/A

The film starts out with a group of disconnected scenes as it represents various aspects of Viktor's memory prior to his interview. The interview allows Viktor to do some minor narration in telling his life's tale going from a child hitman looking like a greaser, to an adult hitman with a constant 3 days worth of growth on his face.Viktor grew up in the part of Romanian where everyone speaks English with an accent. He gets involved with the bad guys, goes on the lam to London etc.The film does have a twist at the end, one that is poorly developed. The characters are written rather badly as is the dialouge. The genius of our hitman is a plot point, but it is not brought out too well, as to make the film interesting. The film consists of a bunch of cardboard cutouts shooting each other. Rather boring for a crime/thriller. Better classified as a crime drama. If you are going to miss a film. This is it.Parental Guide: F-bombs.

1538696,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B007VCQXYC,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","If this movie wasn't a limited release, overseas film, people would be talking about an Academy Award for Best Picture! On the surface it doesn't look like much and the film also starts out painfully slow, but Interview With A Hitman is an incredible story, with some really imaginative twists in it. The story begins with an aging Director, looking for one more chance to be on top. He finds that chance when one of Interpol's most wanted, a career killer, contacts him, and agrees to tell his story. The Director has to jump through some hoops, but once they sit down, the mysterious man starts to tell the story of his life. The man knows nothing but killing, have working for a variety of organized crime outfits since he was 10 years old. From there, the film plays out like any other mafia film you've ever seen, there are shady deals, rats, set-ups, everything you could possibly want in a film about organized crime. Interview With A Hitman does take place in Europe though, and can be somewhat confusing. Thick accents and weird names make following the story a bit tricky at times, and that's the only reason this film didn't receive 5 stars. That being said, the ending more than makes up for it, with a twist that you will never see coming. Luke Goss (Red Widow, Death Race) stars as this stone cold killer and does an excellent job, in a role that really wasn't much of a stretch for him. He always plays these cold, calculating people, and it wouldn't surprise me one bit if he has killed before, Goss is one scary dude. This is the kind of film that will have you thinking about it long after it's over, something every writer hopes to accomplish. When you're going over the events in your mind days after you've seen the film and you are still in awe of what happened, you know you just saw something very special.

1538697,A1S1BJFTA644TU,B007VCQXYC,Zalmorion the Fantastic,"[0, 0]","The bad first.  Well, this movie does drag at times.  The score is pretty boring and sometimes intrusive, in my opinion.  As if some old mental patient is allowed to play the piano while the TV is on.  But that happens only a few times.  Half the cast are great actors; the other half are amateurs.  Lastly, it is hard not to think that the film makers are trying to make this character look like Agent 47.  But the similarities end right away, thankfully, once the story gets going.The good.  The hitman and his tactics are very realistic, interesting, and fun to watch.  The story is brutal and honest.  Its world of crime is not a nice place.  The people who operate within it--even this hitman himself--are not good people.  You will vacillate from the very beginning between despising the hitman and feeling sorry for him.  That is a beauty of this film, I think.  It humanizes the characters and displays quite a bit of their ugliness as it presents what some might perhaps view as redemptive qualities.The plot twists a bit and can be confusing if you don't pay attention.  The ending is a superb twist you will not see coming.  A fitting end, though.  Not one contrived to titillate for no reason.  It makes sense.Overall, this is a pretty good film that entertains.  It is violent and tense at times, disturbing at others.  Give it a watch, if you like hitman tales, mob movies, crime dramas, etc.  This is not an over-the-top Transporter kind of film.  It is a realistic look at a professional doing his job well.
