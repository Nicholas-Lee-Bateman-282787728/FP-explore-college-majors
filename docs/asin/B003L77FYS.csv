But it has rapidly become one of my favorite shows on television.  There are so many elements that keep me glued to my tv week to week - from the palpable chemistry between Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion (Beckett and Castle, respectively), to the incredibly witty script, to the bro-mance between Detectives Ryan and Esposito.  I believe that Season 3 is where this show really hit its stride - nearly every episode has the right amount of intrigue, intensity, and humor.  For me, the best episodes of the season were ""3XK"" (episode 6), ""Last Call"" (episode 10), and ""Knockdown"" (episode13).

Meanwhile, Captain Montgomery's secret is revealed and someone is shot.VIDEO:""Castle - The Complete Third Season"" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) and is enhanced for 169 televisions. The drama series is quite slick as it gives you the feel of New York and like many abc studios related DVD releases, Disney has always done a good job with their TV show transfers. A show that balances outdoor and indoor shots with good lighting, the picture quality for ""CASTLE"" is pretty solid. I didn't see any major artifacting issues or low level noise that was distracting.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:As for the audio, ""Castle - The Complete Third Season"" is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The series is front and center channel driven with a few episodes (that involve gun fights) utilizing the surround channels. The series does utilize quite a bit of music and for the most, the series is clear and understandable.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Castle - The Complete Third Season"" includes the following special features:DISC 1:Audio Commentary - Episode 301 'A Deadly Affair' With Creator/Executive Producer/Writer Andrew W. Marlowe, Director/Executive Producer Rob Bowman And Actor Nathan FillionDISC 2:Audio Commentary - Episode 307 '3XK' with Director Bill Roe, Executive Producer/Writer David Amann And Actors Seamus Dever & Jon HuertasDISC 5:Murder The Wrote - (22:05) An exciting all-new roundtable featuring series star Nathan Fillion, New York Times best-selling author Michael Connelly, Andrew Marlowe (creator/executive producer), Rob Bowman (executive producer) and Brian Michael Bendis (graphic novelist) discuss the genre, tricks of the trade and moreCastle Goes Hollywood - (8:00) An all new behind-the-scenes look at the season`s episode that takes the series characters to Hollywood.Bloopers - (4:14) The outtakes from the third season of ""Castle"".Deleted Scenes - Featuring three deleted scenes: Message from Royce, Honorary Badge and Out of Line.Murder Boards - (3:23) Rob Schow talks about the dry erase boards shown on the series  and how much planning goes into the boards and how they are utilized in the series.Get on the Floor - Music Video -  (2:15) The music video feat. ""Get on the Floor"" (Note: The song does have some mature lyrics that you may not want to play around children).EXTRAS:""Castle - The Complete Third Season"" comes with a slip cover case.JUDGMENT CALL:Finally, after watching three seasons of wondering if Castle and Beckett will ever get together, perhaps longtime viewers have a glimmer of hope for the fourth season.For so long, after seeing Beckett and Castle together and having this chemistry but none of them willing to cross the line beyond their professional working relationship, season three of ""Castle"" really takes things up a notch by showing the viewers that perhaps these two would be good together.Granted, like the previous two seasons, the writers are not going to easily make that happen.  And I don't blame them.Back in the 1980's, when ABC had the hit investigative series ""Moonlighting"" with Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd.  The writers kept these two apart for so long despite the chemistry and sexual tension of the characters and once they got together, it was the final nail in the coffin for the series and from that moment on, the two as a pair brought the downfall of the series.So, sometimes its not a good thing to push relationships but the writers have done a great job of holding things off and building that chemistry.  Do viewers want to see Beckett and Castle together?  Or to continue this built-up sexual tension for between these characters for another season.But the season finale makes you wonder how things will be in season four between these two.Now, possibly the best thing going for season three is the fact that we learn that the murder of Detective Beckett's mother is much bigger than she can ever realize.  In fact, as a viewer, I was even surprised to see how deep this storyline has gotten and I do like how things have gotten progressively bigger each season with this storyline and in this case, possibly quite tragic.  OK, probably not as there is no way Castle is going to die but...Beckett?  Would the writers go that far?  All I can say is that the season finale left me speechless.  Wow!And last, if there is one thing that ""Castle"" writers have been great, that is giving viewers one hell of a season finale.  And to find out one of the characters of the series has a major secret, suffice to say, I never saw that one coming.  And definitely will have ramifications going into season four.As for the DVD, ""Castle - The Complete Third Season"" is once again, another solid release.  Like the previous two DVD box sets, this third season also has a good number of special features including an intriguing roundtable discussion, two audio commentary, a featurette about shooting in Hollywood, outtakes, deleted scenes and a music video.Overall, ""Castle - The Complete Third Season"" features another fun humorous, exciting and explosive season and the writers really stepped up their game with a good balance of plot twists, sexual tension and drama.Definitely recommended!",5,The best season of the series thus far!  Definitely recommended!,1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,8843,"['Witty', 'suspenseful', 'fresh', 'first', 'season', 'CASTLE', 'modern', 'Moonlighting', 'featuring', 'cool', 'cast', 'episode',

There are a few episodes that fall in line with any other cop-procedural shows, and it doesn't seem that these (compared to the rest of the series sub-par) had any interest in holding ours. Still, the charm of the show makes you grin and bear it. The other half of the episodes are, as expected, amazing. There are a few that stand out as instant classics... those featuring a 'murdered cop', an alien conspiracy (containing another 'Firefly' reference), the 200 year old bullet and another couple that will doubtlessly remind you why you watch the show.I truly hope that the producers steer clear of the episodic police trappings and keep focusing on the inter-relationships that make this quirky show worth our time.The bonus features of this set are on par with the previous season sets, which is to say that it is 'decent'. Gag Reels are always enjoyed, but I'd like to see more commentary. Then again, I'd like to hear M.E.

To sort of piggyback on that observation, sometimes you can have all the fancy bells and whistles, but if you don't have that core foundation of a good cast with terrific chemistry, then you ain't got diddles. Regarding the palpable heat generated by Stana Katic and the awesomely awesome Nathan Fillion, only Boreanaz and Deschanel have got them beat. And shallow guy that I am, I admit that Stana Katic coming in to Season 3 with longer hair makes her look even more stunning. It's also nice to see her Detective Beckett loosening up and having more fun this season. You can only do ""icy"" so much.Bestselling mystery novelist Rick Castle must have some kind of pull with New York City's mayor, because he's still going on extended ride alongs with the 12th Precinct, still in the inner circle of the 12th's best homicide detectives, still offering his outside-the-box insights on gruesome murders. Castle's writer's block - which is what led him to his association with NYPD - is long over. Castle has produced two recent best-sellers featuring Nikki Heat, his latest character and based on Detective Kate Beckett. You and me, we know Castle is only sticking around because of Beckett. And, really, with mad respect to Detectives Ryan and Esposito, two fantastic supporting characters, it's Castle and Beckett's interactions that keep me coming back. The homicide cases are occasionally intriguing, but nothing I can't find in other police procedurals. I do like Castle's relationship with his very wise 17-year-old daughter Alexis (Molly Quinn, wonderful). Even if I feel that sometimes, thematically, Castle's domestic complications seem to parallel the murder of the week too often. But Alexis, this season, lands a steady boyfriend, giving Castle a whole new set of headaches.The humor is great, the banter flows naturally. I love the meta-touches, such as Castle promoting his Nikki Heat books and the Derrick Storm graphic novel (all of which actually now exist) and Castle's poker nights with fellow writers such as Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane, and the late Stephen J. Cannell (and I love the touching tribute the show pays to Cannell). And, not to flaunt my nerdiness, but did you also catch Fillion's nod to FIREFLY in the episode ""Close Encounters of the Murderous Kind""?Mulling over Season 3, stream-of-consciousness style: Feuding pizza shops. Murder on a soap opera set. A treasure hunt solved by MAD magazine. The validation of a medium. There's even a vic what gets killed by a 200-year-old bullet, to which Castle remarks: ""Two hundred year old bullet can only mean one thing... Time traveling killer."" But, as good as those episodes are, they aren't the cream of the crop.But these are: The cat-and-mouse ""3XK"" episode has Beckett's team tangling with the notorious Triple Killer. ""Nikki Heat"" guest stars Laura Prepon (That '70s Show) as the actress cast in the film role of Nikki Heat, and this fun episode finds her tagging along with Beckett and Castle on a case. In Season 2's ""Sucker Punch,"" Beckett was forced to kill the hitman who had murdered her mother before she could learn who ordered the hit. Season 3's ""Knockdown"" has Beckett following up another lead in her mother's murder. Adrian Pasdar plays a tautly wired Homeland Security agent in a two-parter (""Setup"" & ""Countdown"") which has the team frantically combing New York City for a dirty bomb set to explode in mere hours. ""To Love and Die in L.A."" has Beckett and Castle taking a trip to Los Angeles to conduct an unsanctioned investigation. (We also get a chance to see Stana Katic in swimwear, so there are no losers here.) In the explosive season finale, ""Knockout,"" Beckett makes more headway into the conspiracy behind her mother's murder, but the cost is the gut-wrenching death of a regular supporting character and a suspenseful cliffhanger.It's no coincidence that these episodes are compelling because they feature a more emotionally-invested cast of characters. And, like all savvy television shows, CASTLE knows how to tease the audience, almost getting the boyish writer and the distant cop together, but then wrenching them apart. You need that element of pining. Season 3 has Castle reuniting with his ex-wife and publicist, while Kate Beckett hooks up with a dashing, motorcycle-riding surgeon. But we realize that these are temporary barriers, and don't pose near the threat to our two leads getting together that Beckett's damaged psyche does. I like the crime-solving bits. But the show's not about that.Bonus features:- Cast & Crew Commentary for 2 episodes, except I'll only mention the cast: ""A Deadly Affair"" (with Nathan Fillion) and ""3XK"" (with Seamus Dever &  Jon Huertas)- Deleted Scenes (and plenty of 'em)- ""Murder They Wrote"" - a round table discussion with creator/exec. producer of CASTLE Andrew Marlowe, exec. producer Rob Bowman, mystery writer Michael Connelly, comic book writer Brian Michael Bendis, and Nathan Fillion (00:22:00 minutes long)- ""CASTLE Goes Hollywood"" - Behind the Scenes of shooting the ""To Die and Love in L.A."" episode (00:07:58 minutes)- Bloopers (00:04:12)- ""Murder Boards"" - Propman Kurt DeFilipps explains the process of producing Beckett's murder boards (00:03:22)- ""Get On The Floor"" Music Video",5,"""Two hundred year old bullet can only mean one thing...

They came packaged and looking great, but when I got to the 5th and last disk of the set it would not play.  Not on my laptop, nor the dvd player to my tv and not on the dvd at my parent's house either.  I once got it to play on my mom's desktop, but only once.  Since then, it doesn't play at all.  Tonite I happened to be working on something and wanted some background sound to drown out other noises, put in the 1st desk of the set... would not play.  Tried the second disk, it skipped and jumped and stalled so much I got annoyed and took it out. So much for background noise while I worked.

It plumbs the grim implications of a civilian in America's biggest police force in a way prior seasons have only hinted at, while finding new and inventive ways to keep Beckett and Castle apart. And it ratchets the backstory of Beckett's mother up to a true and unexpected, but completely satisfying, level.That's not to say that it loses the characteristic humor that drew many viewers into the series in the first place. Frenetic Castle and buttoned-down Beckett continue bouncing zingers off one another in a way that emphasizes their innate culture clash. And one of the season's darkest moments is also the funniest, when sitcom queen Laura Prepon plays an actress playing Beckett, distorting her character almost beyond recognition.Watching the first season, I probably never would have anticipated the directions this show would take by the third season.

Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic have some of the best chemistry I've seen. In the supporting character department I really enjoy Jon Huertas as Esposito. Alexis is a breath of fresh air for a teenage daughter role. So often that role is written as a rebellious teenager who is a challenge for her parent or parents, so it's a refreshing change to have an almost-too-perfect daughter for Castle.What makes this show really stand out for me is that I can enjoy watching it even when I know what's going to happen. The character interaction and dialog are enjoyable enough to carry the show even without the mystery. Something else I appreciate about this show is that it's been consistently good starting with the very first episode. It didn't need time to find its legs and they haven't messed it up after the first couple of seasons in some misguided effort to keep it fresh.If you're wondering why I only gave it four stars, it's because I do have some nits to pick:* It's a little formulaic. Seems like every show they try to browbeat a confession out of at least two people who didn't do it. It's so standard you know the first couple of people they accuse are going to be red herrings. It would be nice to add some variety, such as spending an entire show investigating until they figure out the guy who did it, without trying to get confessions out of people who didn't.* The writers occasionally like to throw wrenches into the Beckett-Castle relationship, usually in the form of an outside romantic interest who shows up out of nowhere and disappears just as fast a few episodes later, and they seemed contrived.* The video quality for this season was disappointing. It's more compressed than in either seasons 2 or 4. The data rate is little more than half of what it is in those seasons, and it shows the form of more compression artifacts and mosquito noise, i.e., a noticeably lower quality picture. A lot of people might not notice but it was pretty obvious to me.

The justification for Rick Castle's continued presence in the 12th precinct, Beckett's search for those who murdered her mother, and of course, the three-year would-be romance between Castle and Beckett, have all come to a point where the writers have some serious decisions to make.  Those decisions will, in season 4, either make or break the series.The show works best when it sticks to a lighter mood, sort of a romantic ""Murder, She Wrote"" with clever plots, good dialogue, and sweet flirtations between the detective and the writer.  It's when the stories get too big and too serious - as with ""Countdown"" and the season finale, ""Knockout"", that the characters seem out of their element and the episodes begin to collapse under their own weight.  These instances have, fortunately, been few and far between but the writers do need to go softly and carefully from this point on.So anyway, yes, get the season 3 DVD.
