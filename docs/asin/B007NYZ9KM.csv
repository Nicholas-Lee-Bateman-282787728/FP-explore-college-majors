But since I visited each, it was nice buying only 1 video to cover all of them.The video mostly concentrates on the geology of the parks.  And there is a section covering the Colorado Plateau as a whole.  It is not a travel log like some other blu rays.Overall, not bad.  But there were some disappointments which include:1. Canyonlands is a beautiful park.  But instead of showing views of it, they talked about Indian petro graphs.2. The best views in Bryce are from the Navajo trail.  But it did not include video from that location.3. All the views from the Grand Canyon are from the south rim - none from the north rim.4. The commentary from the geologist, park ranger and historian were nice.  But they should have showed views of the parks when they talked rather than showing the person.5. The video had nice background music.  But it was stopped when the geologist or ranger or historian talked.Overall, not bad and a good value for the price.  But if you want a video only of the Grand Canyon, then this one is not for you.",4,Nice video of National Parks of the Colorado Plateau,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,1327,"['video', 'following', 'US', 'National', 'Parks', 'Colorado', 'PlateauGrand', 'Canyon', 'NPPainted', 'Desert/Petrified', 'Desert', 'NPArches', 'NPCanyonlands', 'NPCanyon', 'De', 'Chelly', 'National', 'MonumentBryce', 'NPZion', 'NPMesa', 'Verde', 'NPLake', 'Powell', 'National', 'Recreation', 'AreaSo', 'most', 'parks', 'only', 'have', '5', 'minutes', 'video', 'visited', 'was', 'nice', 'buying', 'only', '1', 'video', 'cover', 'them.The', 'video', 'mostly', 'geology', 'parks', 'section', 'covering', 'Colorado', 'Plateau', 'whole', 'not', 'travel', 'log', 'other', 'blu', 'rays.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'were', 'disappointments', 'include:1', 'Canyonlands', 'beautiful', 'park', 'instead', 'showing', 'views', 'talked', 'Indian', 'petro', 'graphs.2', 'best', 'views', 'Bryce', 'are', 'Navajo', 'trail', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'video', 'location.3', 'views', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'are', 'south', 'rim', 'none', 'north', 'rim.4', 'commentary', 'geologist', 'park', 'ranger', 'historian', 'were', 'nice', 'should', 'have', 'showed', 'views', 'parks', 'when', 'talked', 'rather', 'showing', 'person.5', 'video', 'had', 'nice', 'background', 'music', 'was', 'stopped', 'when', 'geologist', 'ranger', 'historian', 'talked.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'good', 'value', 'price', 'want', 'video', 'only', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'then', 'one', 'not']",N/A

1535169,A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ,B007NYZ9KM,PhotoGraphics,"[1, 1]","This movie is titled ""The Grand Canyon"".  I only paid $3.99 for a Bly-Ray version so had no expectation that this was a great video.  Based on its cheesiness the most I could have given it would have been 3 stars.  How did it end up with only 1-star?  Read on.There is not much positive I can say about this video.  There is a belief that Blu-Ray videos are going to have fantastic picture quality.  Not so here.  It is grainy and has dancing pixels in most of the location footage (you can tell it's not the transfer or the DVD player because the interview scenes look fine).  Several times I had the impression it was shot with a cell phone camera.  The scripting is atrocious.  Here's an exaggerated example of his writing style:  ""The rocks are red. They are red because of sediment. Sediment that formed over millions of years.  Years that happened a long time ago.  A long time ago because it wasn't recent"".  After the first half-hour of listening to virtually every sentence begin with the last word of the previous sentence it was hard to take the video seriously without giggling at the amateurish writing (apparently the guy who made the video pretty much was a one-man-band).  The narrator has the emotion of a corpse and listening to his sibilant ssss's was like fingernails on a chalkboard.  I know this was low-budget but didn't anyone think of a simple breath filter in front of his microphone?All of the above might have earned 3-stars for an ""average effort"" so why did I rate it only 1-star?  Because this video is NOT about the Grand Canyon and the video's maker claims it is.  Only about 7 minutes out of 1hr/20min program length is directly related to the Grand Canyon and of that maybe about 2-3 minutes of video (made up of little clips that are a few seconds each) is actually shot at the Grand Canyon and the rest of it is some guy rambling on-camera on about who-knows-what. The movie's remaining video footage?  Most of it was filmed up to 200 miles away in Utah and Colorado which looks nothing like the Grand Canyon (the video maker has an obvious fetish with ""The Colorado Plateau"" as it is mentioned dozens of times). I suspect the guy who filmed it didn't want to file for the permits and pay the fees to GCNPS so he shot some ""home movies"" pretending he was a tourist.The title ""Grand Canyon"" is a complete misrepresentation.  If you are considering buying this video because you likely will never visit the Grand Canyon ... don't.  After watching it you will be hopelessly confused which scenery was shot at the Grand Canyon (hint: only 2-3 minutes of the entire show) and you'll hardly know what the Grand Canyon even looks like.  If you are thinking of buying this video as an educational tool for your children, parental guidance is suggested ... explain to them that they are watching a video about a huge area of Southern Utah, Southwest Colorado, Northwest New Mexico and the Northeast corner of Arizona.  That way they can learn a little (very little) about that area of the American Southwest. It would be misguided for you to tell them that all of those pretty scenes the video maker has lumped into a video titled ""Grand Canyon"" are in or even remotely near the Grand Canyon.It is rare I am so disappointed I give any product only 1-star.
