906982,A12XDEMP7PQPDT,B0009JVOIO,D. DEGEORGE,"[5, 5]","This is one of the most extraordinary discs I have seen. Bernstein's recording of the Mahler Ninth with the Vienna Philharmonic, the one often packaged with his lecture, ""Four Ways to Say Farewell,"" is ultimately the benchmark by which I judge others. The strength of the Bernstein performance is his supreme affinity with Mahler, the passion that he brings to it, and the glorious playing of the Vienna Philharmonic. Thus when I say that this performance comes near to that in almost all respects, I could hardly praise it more. The Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester, composed of young musicians from all over the world, but primarily Europe, plays with amazing accuracy and with more enthusiasm than the Vienna Philharmonic or any other world-class ensemble. The commitment and excitement of these young people is palpable and thrilling. To be fair to the more expert ensembles, I would guess that much more rehearsal time was required to bring these relatively inexperienced musicians to this level of achievement; and it really paid off. With the exception of a couple of minor missed cues in the first and last movements, the ensemble playing was impeccable, amazing for a live performance. To refer back to Bernstein, keeping the orchestra precisely together was not a priority for him; he was willing to let things get a little sloppy as he poured all his effort into the most passionate and sympathetic interpretation possible. Abbado and the assistant director who no doubt laid the advance groundwork for him brought these young musicians to a very high level of precision playing while retaining almost as much excitement as the Bernstein. In using the word ""almost"" I am trying to imagine this performance as a strictly aural experience; however, when I factor in the infectious excitement generated by *seeing* these energized twenty-somethings, I have to say that watching this DVD was the most compelling Mahler experience I have ever had, apart from attending live performances.Sonically, I think this is the best orchestral recording I have ever heard; and I am a long-time collector of at least 2000 LPs and CDs, and a few DVDs. I have to warn the potential buyer, however, that not only is such a judgment always subjective, it depends a great deal on the kind of speakers used, how they are placed, the acoustics of the listening environment, and, in this case, the choice of surround-sound parameters. I have to acknowledge that my speaker system de-emphasizes the lower mid-range of the audio frequency spectrum, a deliberate choice on my part to avoid avoid any muddiness or tubbiness. This DVD, especially in the DTS 5.1 mode, brings a richness to the inner voices (violas and cellos) that surpasses anything I've previously heard; and it does so without sacrificing one iota of clarity--in fact, the mid-frequency strings come through with superior articulation. For listeners with larger main speakers, which already provide a very warm sound in the lower midrange, *may* find this DVD to sound a little muddy in the DTS mode; however, a little boost in the treble would probably correct the situation. The important thing is that the microphone placement and other aspects of the engineering have insured that all the sonic information is available, and the listener may then balance it to his/her needs. Finally, the wide dynamic range of this recording does full justice to Mahler's extreme fortes and whisper-quiet pianissimos.This DVD provides the listener with three audio modes: PCM Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1, and DTS 5.1. PCM Stereo is CD quality (just a little higher in theory because of the higher sampling rate on the DVD), and will probably be the favorite of audiophile purists (those who have been able to tear themselves away from vinyl). I, however, prefer surround sound, not just because it dissolves the walls of my listening room into the ambient acoustics of the concert hall, but also because the five discrete channels aid considerably in rendering each section of the orchestra distinct. I believe that this is one reason that the lower midrange sound can be both warm and clear at the same time. As to the choice between Dolby Digital and DTS, I recommend that the reader Google ""Dolby Digital versus DTS"" to look at the pros and cons of each format. The bottom line seems to be that DTS is the better format in terms of technical measurements and that it tends to push more sound to the rear speakers. Depending on how the engineers originally balance the channels, either format could have an advantage. In the case of this DVD, I found the part about DTS's throwing more sound to the rear to be true; and for my taste and listening environment I found that to be a real advantage. The orchestra sounds broadly spread out in front and a little to the sides, while one gets a pleasant reverberation from the rear of the hall; and for whatever it's worth, I felt as if I were in the audience when there was applause. Some, however, will prefer the Dolby Digital option because it focuses the orchestra more toward the center; it therefore produces a more blended and less analytical sound, and also lightens up on the lower mid-range frequencies. I think it is absolutely marvelous to have a choice of aural perspectives.",5,The best orchestral recording I have ever heard,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,5269,"['one', 'most', 'extraordinary',

906985,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B0009JVOIO,I. Giles,"[0, 0]","Abbado has the enviable reputation of being one of the world's finest Mahler conductors. This performance from 2004 is clearly one of great authority and is given with equal authority by Abbado's own creation, the aptly named Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra. This orchestra takes in players of up to 26 years of age drawn from players from the whole of Europe and is the result of annual extensive interviews held by prominent orchestral players in 25 European cities.The orchestra is widely respected for its technical and musical qualities and has similarities in concept to the Lucerne Festival Orchestra which also recorded the work a little while later. There are, however, significant differences between these two performances and recordings that become apparent right from the start and which are generally maintained throughout.This slightly earlier performance is markedly more dramatic and forthright with less emphasis on particular soloists and with an inevitably stronger full orchestral presence. The pulse is more strongly forwardly pressing. This can be easily checked at any point but is very noticeable from the start of the 3rd movement, the rondo burlesque, where the burlesque element is more forceful. All of this is delivered with total assurance by the orchestra and absolutely no allowances have to be made for the players' relative youth or lack of long-term experience. It is arguable, of course, that these aspects of the players may have influenced Abbado's approach to the interpretation. Whatever the reason, there is a real choice to be made between the two interpretations.The recording is very fine indeed and the Blu-ray version is a clear improvement. The camera work is fully involving for the viewer and provides crisp imaging with good colour rendition. The sound is very full and is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo. It offers a markedly more forward balance than that provided for the Lucerne version. This suits the different interpretation and is a very exciting alternative.The differences between the performances are very significant in my view. There are two contradictory views on what this music is actually about and it seems to me that Abbado's performance here lays less stress on the death-obsessed views that is currently favoured (as described in the booklet interestingly). This is crucial to one's views of the symphony and to how one might react to these two differing performances.The following is a fair resume of the opposing camps as regards the content or intentions behind this music:There are two main competing views as to what this music is about. Mahler, at the time, had just completed two very successful seasons as conductor of The Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic and in his last letters said that he was looking forward to going on tour with the NYPO. In addition he had made considerable progress with his 10th Symphony. None of this suggests a man approaching imminent death and beset by such fears and possible anger as some would have it. On the contrary, it rather suggests a man at the top of his game and looking forward to his future life and continuing success. Indeed, this rather optimistic point of view is the one generally held and put forward by the eminent Mahler authority, Henri-Louis La Grange.When we consider Mahler's own comments and those of his closest colleagues of the Second Viennese School we find that Mahler himself denied that there was any program to his symphonies and asked that they should be judged simply as pure music.In addition, Berg described the 9th as `It expresses an extraordinary love of the earth, for Nature'.Also Schoenberg had this to say ` [The Ninth] contains what may be termed objective, almost dispassionate statements of a beauty which will be perceived only by those who can dispense with visceral warmth and who feel comfortable in a climate of intellectual coldness'Not a word is mentioned by these three men as regards a focus on death. So where does this leave us when confronted by conductors who insist that this is the work of a man facing imminent death with many strong and negative feelings?When considering the music itself it is clear that the first movement has many retrospective elements. The second movement, a rustic l&auml;ndler, becomes distorted and frantic as it progresses. The 3rd movement includes the term `burlesque' in the title which musically simply means a parody. None of these ideas are unique to this one work by Mahler and there are countless other examples in his work of these compositional features. The last movement certainly seems to fragment during its course and finishes very quietly indeed but what else could Mahler to do in order to create compositional balance? He could hardly have ended with yet another quick movement.To return to Abbado, all one can say is that within his own apparently contrasting concepts of the work he and his two orchestras deliver all that one could imagine possible. I personally have a preference for this earlier performance with the Mahler Youth orchestra as I tend to favour the view that this is not death-obsessed music of a dying man but rather an expression of hope etc. as Berg, Schoenberg, Henri-Louis La Grange suggest and very much the music of a man looking forward to more life. We must remember that Mahler himself denied that there was any program to his symphonies and asked that they should be judged simply as pure musicIn summary and in my opinion this is a clear contender for serious consideration for all the reasons as above and should give much pleasure and satisfaction to all purchasers who share either of Abbado's visions of the work. My personal preference, owning both, is for this earlier, less inward and more forwardly dramatic concept. Both performances end in a whisper with the audience held in utter silence with dimmed lighting for a prolonged period of time.",5,"A serious rival, now also in blu-ray, to Abbado's later Lucerne

906987,A2PAD826IH1HFE,B0009JVOIO,J Scott Morrison,"[42, 42]","I will admit that I cannot listen to or attend a performance of Mahler's Ninth Symphony too often because it leaves me exhilarated but wrung out. And this DVD of a performance with Claudio Abbado conducting the group he founded in 1986, the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester, has had that effect on me. I was so overwhelmed by it that I had to sit in a dark room, near tears, for fifteen minutes after it had finished in order to regain my composure. Certainly that is the effect the music often has on me, but in this instance there were other factors involved. The GMJO is made up young European musicians (plus, strangely, a couple from Cuba) who have gained admittance to the orchestra via auditions in twenty-five cities across the Continent. Their intense involvement with the music-making is fueled at least partly by their youth and enthusiasm as well as the opportunity for many of them to be playing this masterpiece for the first time. Lest one think that their youth and inexperience lowers their competence in this music, let me guarantee you that their instrumental assurance here is astonishing. Their emotional involvement with the music is almost palpable. In the rhythmic passages -- the L&auml;ndler and parts of the Rondo-Burleske, for instance -- they almost literally dance in their seats. In the ecstatic passages, and particularly in the closing pages of the symphony, their concentration, their almost religious fervor is visible. The Ninth has numerous instrumental solo passages and every single one of them is taken with musicianship, subtlety and &eacute;lan. I would particularly single out the solo horn, bassoon, flute, first violin, cello and viola. The very young-appearing first trumpet played like a god.After a slightly rough edge in the strings in the first movement, the performance settles in and for most of the following 80+ minutes one hears silken, solid ensemble in strings, winds and brass. Abbado, one of the great conductors now working (and looking healthy in this concert recorded in April 2004, after years of appearing gaunt, almost fragile), conducts without score and clearly is in rare communication with his players. He is one of the few conductors I adore watching. Not only are his gestures impressively clear as regards rhythm and articulation, he communicates the pure emotions of the music through his face and gestures. In Mahler, particularly, this is a plus. And he does it without seeming to dance on the podium. One never doubts what he is feeling and conveying to the orchestra. Fortunately we get to see this via a camera trained on him, but without it becoming a vanity project as it was for his predecessor at the Berlin Philharmonic. Television director Bob Coles and producer Paul  Smaczny are pros, and they know how to vary the shots without interfering with the music and indeed the camera movement enhances, in most instances, its flow. In the closing pages of the symphony -- which, as you will recall, is a very gradual, ecstatic diminuendo/decrescendo into nothingness -- the lights on the orchestra are ever so subtly lowered so that the symphony ends in almost complete darkness. This could have been a clumsy, melodramatic maneuver but here it is done so unobtrusively as to be almost subliminal. The effect, though, is to emphasize Mahler's rapt final thoughts.The performance was recorded at a concert in the visually stunning new hall of the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome.This is the second Mahler symphony DVD with Abbado. The other, of the Fifth, was with the Lucerne Festival Orchestra (which is made up of principals from all over Europe joining with alumni of the GMJO, an ensemble calling themselves the  Mahler Chamber Orchestra). It, too, was outstanding. I look forward to more additions to this series, if series it be. These two DVDs make me keen for more.Very enthusiastically recommended.1DVD; Sound: PCM Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1, or DTS 5.1; TT=84minsScott Morrison",5,"An Extraordinary, Moving Experience",1119484800,"06 23, 2005",2005,3966,"['will', 'admit', 'can', 'not', 'listen', 'attend', 'performance', 'Mahler', 'Ninth', 'Symphony', 'too', 'often', 'exhilarated', 'out', 'DVD', 'performance', 'Claudio', 'Abbado', 'conducting', 'group', 'founded', '1986', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'Jugendorchester', 'had', 'effect', 'was', 'so', 'overwhelmed', 'had', 'sit', 'dark', 'room', 'tears', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'had', 'finished', 'order', 'regain', 'composure', 'Certainly', 'effect', 'music', 'often', 'instance', 'were', 'other', 'factors', 'involved', 'GMJO', 'made', 'up', 'young', 'European', 'musicians', 'strangely', 'couple', 'Cuba', 'who', 'have', 'gained', 'admittance', 'orchestra', 'auditions', 'twenty-five', 'cities', 'Continent', 'intense', 'involvement', 'music-making', 'fueled', 'least', 'partly', 'youth', 'enthusiasm', 'as', 'well', 'opportunity', 'many', 'be', 'playing', 'masterpiece', 'first', 'time', 'Lest', 'one', 'think', 'youth', 'inexperience', 'lowers', 'competence', 'music', 'let', 'guarantee', 'instrumental', 'assurance', 'here', 'astonishing', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'music', 'almost', 'palpable', 'rhythmic', 'passages', 'L', 'auml', 'parts', 'Rondo-Burleske', 'instance', 'almost', 'literally', 'dance', 'seats', 'ecstatic', 'passages', 'particularly', 'closing', 'pages', 'symphony', 'concentration', 'almost', 'religious', 'fervor', 'visible', 'Ninth', 'numerous', 'instrumental', 'solo', 'passages', 'single', 'one', 'taken', 'musicianship', 'subtlety', 'eacute', 'lan', 'would', 'particularly', 'single', 'out', 'solo', 'horn', 'bassoon', 'flute', 'first', 'violin', 'cello', 'viola', 'very', 'young-appearing', 'first', 'trumpet', 'played', 'god.After', 'slightly', 'rough', 'edge', 'strings', 'first', 'movement', 'performance', 'settles', 'most', 'following', '80+', 'minutes', 'one', 'silken', 'solid', 'ensemble', 'strings', 'winds', 'brass', 'Abbado', 'one', 'great', 'conductors', 'now', 'working', 'looking', 'healthy', 'concert', 'recorded', 'April', '2004', 'years', 'appearing', 'gaunt', 'almost', 'fragile', 'score', 'clearly', 'rare', 'communication', 'players', 'one', 'few', 'conductors', 'adore', 'watching', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'gestures', 'impressively', 'clear', 'regards', 'rhythm', 'articulation', 'pure', 'emotions', 'music', 'face', 'gestures', 'Mahler', 'particularly', 'plus', 'seeming', 'dance', 'podium', 'One', 'never', 'what', 'feeling', 'conveying', 'orchestra', 'Fortunately', 'get', 'see', 'camera', 'trained', 'becoming', 'vanity', 'project', 'was', 'predecessor', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'Television', 'director', 'Bob', 'Coles', 'producer', 'Paul', 'Smaczny', 'are', 'pros', 'know', 'how', 'vary', 'shots', 'interfering', 'music', 'indeed', 'camera', 'movement', 'enhances', 'most', 'instances', 'flow', 'closing', 'pages', 'symphony', 'will', 'recall', 'very', 'gradual', 'ecstatic', 'diminuendo/decrescendo', 'nothingness', 'lights', 'orchestra', 'are', 'ever', 'so', 'subtly', 'lowered', 'so', 'symphony', 'almost', 'complete', 'darkness', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'clumsy', 'melodramatic', 'maneuver', 'here', 'done', 'so', 'unobtrusively', 'be', 'almost', 'subliminal', 'effect', 'emphasize', 'Mahler', 'rapt', 'final', 'thoughts.The', 'performance', 'was', 'recorded', 'concert', 'visually', 'stunning', 'new', 'hall', 'Accademia', 'Santa', 'Cecilia', 'Rome.This', 'second', 'Mahler', 'symphony', 'DVD', 'Abbado', 'other', 'Fifth', 'was', 'Lucerne', 'Festival', 'Orchestra', 'made', 'principals', 'Europe', 'joining', 'alumni', 'GMJO', 'ensemble', 'calling', 'Mahler', 'Chamber', 'Orchestra', 'too', 'was', 'outstanding', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'additions', 'series', 'series', 'be', 'two', 'DVDs', 'make', 'keen', 'more.Very', 'enthusiastically', 'Sound', 'PCM', 'Stereo', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'DTS', '5.1', 'TT=84minsScott', 'Morrison']",N/A

Like with his magnificent live recording of this symphony with the Berliner Philharmoniker, there is, right from the very first instant, a sense of forward momentum (there are absolutely no agogic hesitations to be found in that arresting, very first 'sighing' theme) that immediately grabs your attention. But at the same time it is Claudio Abbado's genius to leave room for all of the intricate orchestral phrasings and instrumental colorings to register to the full when needed or asked for. This is not a 'hasty' Ninth at all, but it does have quite a sense of 'flow' that keeps things together wonderfully (also the attention of the listener). All events seem to have a well-defined purpose within the 'grand dramatic scheme', or at least, so it feels to me.At the same time that Claudio Abbado's Mahler is 'purposely forward going', it is, I think, 'under-sentimentalized' Mahler, or Mahler 'afresh' (what others might call 'lyrical'), which is good. As with seemingly all of Claudio Abbado's later (live) recordings of Mahler, there is a superb sense of forward momentum with wonderfully stylish dramatic accents. All instrumentalists are given their chance to shine and 'show off' their unique, fresh talents, and the microphones catch all of the detail and pianissimos (what exquisite last few minutes!) brilliantly, with instruments fairly directly recorded, but at the same time the sound is nicely blended within a beautifully natural soundscape. This is not so much 'dry-eyed' Mahler, it is more a 'purified' or 'rarified' Mahler in the best possible senses of the words. The final few bars have maybe never sounded more like a 'purification of the soul' as right here, without any of the sentiments of deep sadness or utter despair that other performances might convey.Anyhow, whatever (misguided) qualifying descriptions on my part, I believe Claudio Abbado is as sure-footed and confident a guide through Mahler's eventful and precipitous soulscape as one could ever wish. And also, what joy to be able to see this maestro at work here, with his delicate and graceful but very confident gestures, inspiring these wonderful young and handsome musicians to give their very best, which is all quite something to behold!With the help of maybe on of the best orchestra's in the world at the moment, and recorded in the best possible digital manner (audio as well as video!), the music of Gustav Mahler has maybe never sounded so fresh and inspired - so utterly and completely truthful and convincing.A magnificent aural and visual experience.

If available, I'll use the DTS mode of a recording as this gives the best sound in my room for my ears.This recording is by far the best surround recording that I have heard in my life. One of the previous reviewers D.DEGEORGE has it absolutely right. This recording gives you the impression as if you stand in the conductor's place, the sound field is at least 160 degrees (my side speakers are a tad forward from my ears). The orchestra just sounds amazing, you just close your eyes and follow that sound. Every instrument group is clearly defined and the sound moves through the room in front of you.(As I hardly looked, I can't comment on the out-of-synch remarks, but for me the picture hardly mattered. It's fine as a DVD.)If you have a decent surround setup, this is the one to get to show your friends how your system sounds. If it doesn't, your setup needs improvement. Very good recordings are the The Barber of Seville with Florez, The Daughter of the Regiment with Florez, Romeo and Juliette with Machaidze/Villazon, La Cenerentola with Donose, Opera Gala from Baden-Baden with Netrebko, Verdi's Requiem with Abbado. Hard to believe but this one is better as far as the surround aspect is concerned. Just an unbelievable sound stage.

906990,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B0009JVOIO,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[5, 5]","After what he's been through, you have to believe Mahler's 9th has a special meaning for Claudio Abbado.  The conductor who survived stomach cancer (so far, at least--as of this writing, it's alarming that he has just canceled a bunch of upcoming concerts at the advice of his doctors) here gives Mahler's most unflinching look at death a deep interpretation.  The work almost seems like a catharsis for Abbado.  Or maybe a religious excursion would be more like it.  At any rate, this is a Mahler 9 for the ages.You'd think, listening with eyes closed, that such playing would have to come from a big name orchestra of seasoned players--Berlin, Vienna, Amsterdam--right?  But we are hearing the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra, which Mr. Abbado himself founded.  These young musicians--some disarmingly young--play like the best of the pros.  Their enthusiasm is evident--I also have a superb CD by them of the Mahler 5th and 10th symphonies conducted by Rudolph Barshai, which I have reviewed here.  That recording is also a must-own.This is one stunning performance, with some of the best-defined counterpoint I've ever heard in a Mahler 9th.  There are string passages in the heart of the first movement's development that have never made complete sense to me before, until I heard them clarified here.  If you want to hear some of these passages, go to YouTube and type in ""Mahler Last Symphony.""  It's a preview of this DVD with samples, and the very first one shows the orchestra in full cry in one of the knottiest sections of the first movement.  Hearing that passage alone made me immediately order this DVD.The rest doesn't disappoint.  The second movement has the lovely dance lilt that many of the more lead-footed readings lack.  The singing lyricism in the later parts, though, are perhaps done better by Walter (1962) but that's a high bar.  And the third movement burlesque doesn't have the sinister bite and out-of-control passions of Lenny, but again, high standards.  It *does* have the sweetest plaintive cry in the trumpet of what becomes the finale's main theme that I think I have ever heard, and this really send shivers down my spine.  To me this moment has always marked Mahler stopping the glitzy society entertainments to ask to consider what is *really* important in life.  The music then rebuffs this plea with a snicker.  Really magical, and Abbado makes the most of it.  It's deeply felt.""Deeply felt"" doesn't begin to describe the finale.  This movement is tricky; it can come off heavy-handed and ""full of oneself"" if taken the wrong way.  Previously I've actually preferred cooler-headed conductors such as Haitink here, but Abbado takes it at full passion and makes it work.  Again, although I try not to always read personal lives into performances, since artists, like you and me, often just work their job, I have to believe Abbado poured a lot of his own experiences and thoughts into his approach here.  This is powerful stuff, but it never (at least to my ears) topples over into self-pity and wallowing.  And although I find stage effects incongruous with serious music, I have to admit the ending, where they gradually dim the lights as the music fades, to be effective and appropriate.  It may have even helped the musicians and conductor.  The last few bars are silence, and Abbado ""conducts"" this silence as well as he conducts the notes.  A brilliant, brilliant ending to a great classical music DVD.The picture--anamorphic, 16:9, is crisp and beautiful.  It's region-free, so you can play it anywhere, on any player.  (I hope this becomes a trend.)  I'm watching it on an HDMI DVD player that upscale converts, so that helps somewhat, but still, this is an outstanding DVD.  Sound is good and warm and rich, and audience noise is well-suppressed.  There's only one annoying flat to me, but it does bear mentioning: the sound and picture are not perfectly synched, so that sound is about three or four frames ahead.  This isn't noticible in most ordinary passages, but when the timpaninst solos or the violins pluck, it's evident.  What's frustrating is it would have been easy to fix, if only the people who produce this stuff were paying a little closer attention to their work.Overall, though, this would be a desert island DVD for me, and is a better live Mahler 9th than I've ever experienced live in concert (Haitink in Amsterdam, Rattle in New York, Rattle in Berlin) and better than any live performance CD I have.  The youth orchestra--filled with fresh-faced young men and women clearly eager to please their conductor--respond beautifully and give a very nuanced performance.  You can't go wrong, so just grab it now--what are you waiting for?",5,Passionate and deeply felt,1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,4701,"['what', 'been', 'have', 'believe', 'Mahler', '9th', 'special', 'meaning', 'Claudio', 'Abbado', 'conductor', 'who', 'survived', 'stomach', 'cancer', 'so', 'far', 'least', 'writing', 'alarming', 'just', 'canceled', 'bunch', 'upcoming', 'concerts', 'advice', 'doctors', 'here', 'Mahler', 'most', 'unflinching', 'look', 'death', 'deep', 'interpretation', 'work', 'almost', 'catharsis', 'Abbado', 'maybe', 'religious', 'excursion', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'rate', 'Mahler', '9', 'ages.You', ""'d"", 'think', 'listening', 'eyes', 'closed', 'such', 'playing', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'big', 'name', 'orchestra', 'seasoned', 'players', 'Berlin', 'Vienna', 'Amsterdam', 'right', 'are', 'hearing', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'Youth', 'Orchestra', 'Mr.', 'Abbado', 'founded', 'young', 'musicians', 'disarmingly', 'young', 'play', 'best', 'pros', 'enthusiasm', 'evident', 'also', 'have', 'superb', 'CD', 'Mahler', '5th', '10th', 'symphonies', 'conducted', 'Rudolph', 'Barshai', 'have', 'reviewed', 'here', 'recording', 'also', 'must-own.This', 'one', 'stunning', 'performance', 'best-defined', 'counterpoint', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'Mahler', '9th', 'are', 'string', 'passages', 'heart', 'first', 'movement', 'development', 'have', 'never', 'made', 'complete', 'sense', 'heard', 'clarified', 'here', 'want', 'hear', 'passages', 'go', 'YouTube', 'type', 'Mahler', 'Last', 'Symphony', 'preview', 'DVD', 'samples', 'very', 'first', 'one', 'orchestra', 'full', 'cry', 'one', 'knottiest', 'sections', 'first', 'movement', 'Hearing', 'passage', 'alone', 'made', 'immediately', 'order', 'DVD.The', 'rest', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'second', 'movement', 'lovely', 'dance', 'lilt', 'many', 'more', 'lead-footed', 'readings', 'lack', 'singing', 'lyricism', 'later', 'parts', 'are', 'perhaps', 'done', 'better', 'Walter', '1962', 'high', 'bar', 'third', 'movement', 'burlesque', ""n't"", 'have', 'sinister', 'bite', 'out-of-control', 'passions', 'Lenny', 'again', 'high', 'standards', 'have', 'sweetest', 'plaintive', 'cry', 'trumpet', 'what', 'finale', 'main', 'theme', 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'really', 'send', 'shivers', 'down', 'spine', 'moment', 'always', 'marked', 'Mahler', 'stopping', 'glitzy', 'society', 'entertainments', 'ask', 'consider', 'what', '*really*', 'important', 'life', 'music', 'then', 'plea', 'snicker', 'Really', 'magical', 'Abbado', 'most', 'deeply', 'felt', 'Deeply', 'felt', ""n't"", 'begin', 'describe', 'finale', 'movement', 'tricky', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'heavy-handed', 'full', 'taken', 'wrong', 'way', 'Previously', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'preferred', 'cooler-headed', 'conductors', 'such', 'Haitink', 'here', 'Abbado', 'full', 'passion', 'work', 'Again', 'try', 'not', 'always', 'read', 'personal', 'lives', 'performances', 'artists', 'often', 'just', 'work', 'job', 'have', 'believe', 'Abbado', 'poured', 'lot', 'own', 'experiences', 'thoughts', 'approach', 'here', 'powerful', 'stuff', 'never', 'least', 'ears', 'over', 'self-pity', 'wallowing', 'find', 'stage', 'effects', 'incongruous', 'serious', 'music', 'have', 'admit', 'ending', 'where', 'gradually', 'dim', 'lights', 'music', 'be', 'effective', 'appropriate', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'helped', 'musicians', 'conductor', 'last', 'few', 'bars', 'are', 'silence', 'Abbado', 'conducts', 'silence', 'as', 'well', 'notes', 'brilliant', 'brilliant', 'ending', 'great', 'classical', 'music', 'DVD.The', 'picture', 'anamorphic', '16:9', 'crisp', 'beautiful', 'region-free', 'can', 'play', 'anywhere', 'player', 'hope', 'trend', ""'m"", 'watching', 'HDMI', 'DVD', 'player', 'upscale', 'converts', 'somewhat', 'still', 'outstanding', 'DVD', 'Sound', 'good', 'warm', 'rich', 'audience', 'noise', 'well-suppressed', 'only', 'one', 'annoying', 'flat', 'bear', 'mentioning', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'not', 'perfectly', 'synched', 'sound', 'three', 'four', 'frames', 'ahead', ""n't"", 'noticible', 'most', 'ordinary', 'passages', 'when', 'timpaninst', 'solos', 'violins', 'pluck', 'evident', 'What', 'frustrating', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'fix', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'produce', 'stuff', 'were', 'paying', 'little', 'closer', 'attention', 'work.Overall', 'though', 'would', 'be', 'desert', 'island', 'DVD', 'better', 'live', 'Mahler', '9th', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'experienced', 'live', 'concert', 'Haitink', 'Amsterdam', 'Rattle', 'New', 'York', 'Rattle', 'Berlin', 'better', 'live', 'performance', 'CD', 'have', 'youth', 'orchestra', 'filled', 'fresh-faced', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'clearly', 'eager', 'please', 'conductor', 'respond', 'beautifully', 'give', 'very', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'so', 'just', 'grab', 'now', 'what', 'are', 'waiting']",N/A
