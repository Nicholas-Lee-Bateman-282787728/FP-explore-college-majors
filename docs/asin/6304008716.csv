Unless the man will shoot a politician his daughter will be killed! He is closely shadowed to prevent disobedience to his orders. Can he rescue his daughter? Will a guard check him for his hidden revolver? The fix is in. Smitty is in control! The conspiracy involves the politician's security (like the Praetorian Guard). Will Watson be immediately shot after he performs his task? [Yes, they will leave no witnesses.] Can Watson get help from the Governor's aide? ""Yes, its real."" We learn of the surprising conspiracy behind this assassination.Governor Grant was not following the wishes of her backers. Can Watson get help from the workers in that hotel? He tells Governor Grant about the plot. Does she believe Watson's story? Will she cancel her speech? She learns the truth from her husband! ""The Governor has been shot!"" Can a successful plan go awry? Yes, when it involves a person who is not a willing member of the conspiracy. [I suspect Watson was a hasty replacement for the original patsy.] Of course, the villains fail and suffer so the good guys win in the end. Will the Big Shot behind the plot get away? Too big to fail?This is a very intense film with little padding to fill out its allotted time. You can compare it to actual historic events, such as the assassination of William Goebel the Governor of Kentucky in 1899. You'll never see this mentioned in the Corporate Media. I suspect that Watson was a hasty replacement for the original patsy who tried to get out (but he knew too much). Smitty told about having to kill his buddy. I think this is better than ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", either the 1936 or 1956 movie by Alfred Hitchcock.

Sadly to say, the former is the superior film in every aspect. However, Nick of Time is a good fun regardless. It's really a Christopher Walken's film. He steals every scene that he appears in, and he makes them even more fun by beating the hell out of Johnny Depp's character. Without a question, there is a classic Christopher Walken moment when he silently says ""Motherf..."" after throwing Depp from probably a third story into the small water fountain. Yes, indeed...Nick of Time is all Christopher Walken. On the other hand, Johnny Depp does a decent job, requiring not much of depth out of him. The ending is what brings The Manchurian Candidate to my mind. I just give Nick of Time points off for its poor, unnecessary ""stylized"" camera work in the first half.

He is chosen in the most cynical way by bad guys Mr. Smith (Christopher Walker) and Ms. Jones (Roma Maffia) because it is apparent he would do anything to protect his daughter.So they are going to hold her hostage to force him to kill the governor of California, Eleanor Grant (Marsha Mason). Problem is, he does not know who to trust. He tries to stop a cop on the beat to tell him about the situation, but Smith is watching him. He tries to tell the cab driver that takes him to the hotel where the governor is going to be speaking, but the cabbie throws away the business card on which he has written an urgent note without even reading the back of it. He tries to tell the governor herself in an elevator, but Smith pushes in. All the while, Jones is in their van with his little girl.The story is done in real time, including runs to the bathroom (part of the plot line), rides in elevators, walks down stairs and corridors.

395605,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,6304008716,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[0, 2]","In director John Badham's stylish thriller Nick of Time, audiences are given the unique opportunity to watch as the suspenseful story unfolds in ""real time"". The film, which has often been dismissed by critics as a typical thriller, deserves a second glance. The film's too quickly overlooked and forgotten, which is a shame considering how enjoyable it is to watch.Starring a terrific cast headed by Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken, Nick of Time is a more character and plot driven thriller than most. Although it's many overt references to Hitchcock films grows tiresome, the film succeeds on many levels, particularly because of the pairing of Depp and Walken.The story follows accountant Gene Watson as he and his young daughter are put into mortal danger. They are approached by a sinister man, named Mr. Smith, who proposes to blackmail Watson. Mr. Smith says that he will kill Watson's daughter in exactly 75 minutes if Watson doesn't assassinate the Californian governor Eleanor Grant. As Watson struggles with his conscience and fails repeatedly to free himself of his situation, he soon learns that he cannot save both himself and his daughter, while protecting the governor. However, he manages to use his resourcefulness and arranges a meeting with the governor's aide and her secretary. That seems his best bet to avoid committing murder, until it turns out that the people that hired the ever-present Mr. Smith are part of the governor's own cabinet. Racing against the clock, Watson must uncover the source of this assassination conspiracy and save his daughter from the clutches of Mr. Smith and his insidious supporters, but the clock is ticking.Though the film was poorly received during its initial release, it has since become a modest hit. What makes the film so interesting, from my own perspective, is that it set the template for the television show 24. The entire first season of24follows a Counter-Terrorist agent named jack Bauer as he is blackmailed into assassinating the first black presidential candidate or else his wife and daughter will be murdered. Like Nick of Time,  the television show also unfolds in ""real time"". Each episode, which runs at about 44-47 minutes without commercial interruption, takes place during one hour in the day of Agent Bauer's life.Certainly Nick of Time is a flawed film, but it does feature some impressive performances. Johnny Depp, who at the time was only playing weird outcast characters, gives perhaps his most underrated performance as the desperate Gene Watson and Christopher Walken is unforgettable as Mr. Smith.Also recommended:Strangers on a TrainThe Manchurian Candidate(1962 original)Cape Fear(1962 original)WitnessFranticCape Fear(1991 remake)In the Line of FireThe NetRansom",3,The Clock Is Ticking,1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,2757,"['director', 'John', 'Badham', 'stylish', 'thriller', 'Nick', 'Time', 'audiences', 'are', 'given', 'unique', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'suspenseful', 'story', 'unfolds', 'real', 'time', 'film', 'often', 'been', 'dismissed', 'critics', 'typical', 'thriller', 'second', 'glance', 'film', 'too', 'quickly', 'overlooked', 'forgotten', 'shame', 'considering', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'watch.Starring', 'terrific', 'cast', 'headed', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Nick', 'Time', 'more', 'character', 'plot', 'driven', 'thriller', 'most', 'many', 'overt', 'references', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'tiresome', 'film', 'many', 'levels', 'particularly', 'pairing', 'Depp', 'Walken.The', 'story', 'accountant', 'Gene', 'Watson', 'young', 'daughter', 'are', 'put', 'mortal', 'danger', 'are', 'approached', 'sinister', 'man', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'who', 'blackmail', 'Watson', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'will', 'kill', 'Watson', 'daughter', 'exactly', '75', 'minutes', 'Watson', ""n't"", 'assassinate', 'Californian', 'governor', 'Eleanor', 'Grant', 'Watson', 'conscience', 'repeatedly', 'free', 'situation', 'soon', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'daughter', 'protecting', 'governor', 'However', 'use', 'resourcefulness', 'meeting', 'governor', 'aide', 'secretary', 'best', 'bet', 'avoid', 'committing', 'murder', 'out', 'people', 'hired', 'ever-present', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'are', 'part', 'governor', 'own', 'cabinet', 'Racing', 'clock', 'Watson', 'must', 'uncover', 'source', 'assassination', 'conspiracy', 'save', 'daughter', 'clutches', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'insidious', 'supporters', 'clock', 'film', 'was', 'poorly', 'received', 'initial', 'release', 'become', 'modest', 'hit', 'What', 'film', 'so', 'interesting', 'own', 'perspective', 'set', 'template', 'television', 'show', '24', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'Counter-Terrorist', 'agent', 'named', 'jack', 'Bauer', 'blackmailed', 'assassinating', 'first', 'black', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'else', 'wife', 'daughter', 'will', 'be', 'murdered', 'Nick', 'Time', 'television', 'show', 'also', 'real', 'time', 'episode', '44-47', 'minutes', 'commercial', 'interruption', 'place', 'one', 'hour', 'day', 'Agent', 'Bauer', 'life.Certainly', 'Nick', 'Time', 'flawed', 'film', 'feature', 'impressive', 'performances', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'who', 'time', 'was', 'only', 'playing', 'weird', 'outcast', 'characters', 'perhaps', 'most', 'underrated', 'performance', 'desperate', 'Gene', 'Watson', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'unforgettable', 'Mr.', 'Smith.Also', 'recommended', 'Strangers', 'TrainThe', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', '1962', 'original', 'Cape', 'Fear', '1962', 'original', 'WitnessFranticCape', 'Fear', '1991', 'remake', 'Line', 'FireThe', 'NetRansom']",Nick of Time VHS

It was still interesting and fast-moving.I especially didn't like the governor's character. She didn't seem that bright. Depp's character told her that he was going to have to kill her to save his daughter if she made a final speech. He said her husband wanted her dead, advised her to get out of that speech, and that she wouldn't be able to. She tried to cancel...but herhusband convinced her to change her mind.Then, the husband said he sent her assistant on an ""errand""...but Depp had told her that the assistant was dead. I figure that was more than enough to definitely not do the speech. When the guns are going off, she just stands around forever.Ultimately, it was Mr. Walken's portrayal of the blackmailer that carried this film. He was evil and had some funny moments at the same time. I chuckled when Depp said something like ""You're insane."" and Walken pauses a moment and goes ""What's your point?""; or when Depp's leaving a bathroom and is told to wash his hands.His character wasn't perfect, of course. I would have especially been more suspicious when Depp goes to the shoe shine man a second time; also, when I saw the man laugh a bit/nod after I said something to him...after being told that he was deaf.The ""real-time"" idea was cool, but I wish it was more...real. When the clock changed in the film to 12:17 and my digital clock nearby said the same thing, I expected it to be accurate with the passage of time.

395616,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6304008716,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","NICK OF TIME crackles like a good, taut thriller ought. The plot unfolds like a good, old-fashioned Hitchcock nerve-jangler. Heck, even the score is reminiscent of Hitchcock's past film scores. I like the conceit of the story's taking place in real time. And since this film runs only a bit past 90 minutes, no sooner do public accountant Gene Watson (Johnny Depp) and his young daughter Lynn (Courtney Chase) disembark at the Union Station in downtown Los Angeles than they're menaced by two government officials, Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken) and Ms. Jones (Roma Maffia). Having gained privacy in a van, Mr. Smith spells it out for Gene. Unless Gene assassinates a prominent public figure, his adorable child will be murdered. He has 90 minutes to get it done. He gets handed a gun and an itinerary. Let's start the clock-gazing.Johnny Depp imbues his character with this unassuming trait that makes him relatable, but then he also sneaks in a dash of subversive pluck, and this makes him rootable. Faced with an impossible dilemma, Gene Watson balks and tries repeatedly to throw a monkey wrench into Mr. Smith's plans, on the sly, of course. He slips a note to the taxi driver. He approaches a cop. He waves the gun and attempts to commandeer the van. But Mr. Smith, constant shadow, thwarts him at each turn, at each try to recruit help or get the word out. And as the clock winds down closer and closer to deadline, a desperate Gene begins to contemplate doing the unthinkable. In the eleventh hour, in a harrowing sequence at a hotel lobby, Gene is at last able to convince and enlist the help of a skeptical half-deaf, one-legged shoeshining man (Charles S. Dutton). But if your hopes lie in a disadavantaged dude like that, how secure do you feel, really?John Badham - who also directed two favorites,WarGames (25th Anniversary Edition)andStakeout- knows what he's doing, knows how to exquisitely ramp up the tension. The experiment of the real time ticking clock helps. It draws you deeper into the narrative, the fact that, mostly, we can account for the elapsing minutes. Most of the action takes place in the swanky Westin Bonaventure Hotel (also in downtown L.A.), a structure that practically becomes a secondary character, so well does Badham utilize the spaces within to establish certain key sequences. In the Bonaventure, the governor of California (Marsha Mason) is scheduled to hold a political rally. In 90 minutes.At this stage, Christopher Walken is done being subtle. Christopher Walken is basically playing Christopher Walken, and it's always entertaining to take in his brand of crazy and quirk. He does exude menace. He makes you believe he really is capable of pulling the trigger on a little girl. For most of the movie he succeeds in flustering Depp's everyman protagonist. Luckily, Depp doesn't ever resort to trite action hero theatrics. To the last, he applies his wits. It lends a measure of credibility to a pretty preposterous plot. Because, really, long before Chris Walken's Mr. Smith lost his cool, he should've opted to just do the job himself. I figure, to a professional's professional, it wasn't worth it tolerating the accountant's frequent acts of defiance. Anyway, check out NICK OF TIME for a brace of unexpected (and expected) twists. Check it out for Depp's good restrained performance and for Walken's predictably showy turn. Check it out for Badham's swerve on that old Hitchcock convention in which the man-on-the-run meets and is abetted by a lovely girl. But don't check it out for that cameo by former L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley. He dates the film something awful. And maybe the shoeshining man turns out to be more resourceful and timely than is believable, and the motivation for wanting the governor dead not explored enough. And maybe, near the end, that waiter was too convenient with his cart. Still, I think John Badham pulls it off with great flair and taut execution.

Apart from the fact that he looked so much better without the glasses, and he was called Gene Watson (of all names!), it turned out to be an alright movie.If you can ignore the continuous clock watching, and Christopher Walken always suddenly appearing in the background, and generally getting in the way, you'll probably get sucked in. But if you find these things distracting, you probably won't enjoy it as much. To be honest, the clock watching was getting on my nerves, as well as Christopher Walken & his ratty little mustache. But Johnny Depp is pretty much the centre of attention the whole time.I've never seen the series 24, so this was my first experience of ""real time"". I found it quite good actually, despite the clock watching, and there were no slow bits, and you're constantly on the edge of your seat. Although, Johnny is far better in the more eccentric roles he chooses - he's never been a Hollywood starlet, who accepts every script he's shown. Most of the time, he looks uncomfortable with the gun, and as the clean shaven, short haired, bespectacled smart guy, he doesn't have the same appeal as the long haired kooky guy he normally portrays.Some people have said why at the start, didn't he just grab his daughter, and shoot Christopher Walken's character in the head? Well, stupid, then there wouldn't be a movie!There is a rather dodgy scene, a dream sequence, which will throw you completely. I didn't really think about it at the time the movie is supposed to be in real-time. I was too distracted by the fact that a gun which only holds 6 bullets, manages to shoot 7 or 8 if not more, without ever running out. Strange.Sure, the plot of the story has a few minor holes, but it's still a good movie. But if you want to see a good Johnny Depp performance, grab one of his older movies, Benny & Joon, or something similar. They can probably be bought dead cheap.

Later while he's pointing the gun at the head of the woman watching his child and she effectively talks him out of pulling the trigger by scaring him that the gunfire would ""go through the seat"" or be ""deflected by a button"" and hurt his girl, I could not believe how stupid his character apparently was.  A quick shot in the woman's head from the angle at which he was holding the gun would certainly not go through the seat or deflect off a button, and the woman would certainly be dead and he could have taken his daughter and fled.

He choses unusual roles and brings a unique presence to each character.  Having said that, i am sad to say i don't recommend this specific film. I think most of us like to believe we are smarter than the 'bad guys'... and even though Depp always takes a contrarian approach to society and characters, i nevertheless felt my need to identify with the victim and overcome the villain was not being sufficiently fed.  Who knows, maybe that's what Depp was striving for, the uncertainty and uncomfortableness of being in such quagmire of absurdities as to leave us (me) feeling angry at the good character, for being so dense.  Christopher Walken turned in an average performance as one of the villains (If he really wants to expand his range he should try playing a vulnerable good guy).  Perhaps that's what's really missing in this film- proper casting.  Walken should have been cast as the hero and Depp as the villain. This 'Real Time' (Pre-'24') Drama really didn't work for me, but it appears to have set the standard for other 'real time' shows.

Originally a stock director on Rod Serling's wonderful series Night Gallery (and responsible for that show's most genuinely chilling episode, ""Green Fingers""), Badham went onto one of those painfully inconsistent movie careers that make one wonder whether the hits are talent or luck. Is the guy who directed Saturday Night Fever and Wargames really the same person responsible for Stakeout (and, worse, its sequel), Short Circuit, and the stultifyingly bad made-for-TV flick Brother's Keeper? So one never knows what one is going to come up with when encountering a Badham film.Nick of Time falls halfway between, but nudging onto the good side. Much of this has to do with Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken in the main roles, with support from an astonishingly fine cast of minor characters (Charles S. Dutton, Marsha Mason, Gloria Reuben, Peter Strauss, Roma Maffia, and many more). In this episode of ""generic thriller,"" Walken (with Maffia as an accomplice) have kidnapped Depp's daughter, and in order to get her back, they want a favor: kill the governor of California (Mason), who's on the campaign trail for re-election. Depp has ninety minutes to do so, and Walken is usually standing over his shoulder trying to figure out why the guy's so blessedly incompetent.While this is not one of either Depp or Walken's more outstanding performances, both are quite capable in their roles. The plot is good, if brainless, and the pace is well done. There's really nothing bad to be said about this film, although there's nothing that makes it stand out from the crop, either.

Without them, hmm, it would quietly drift into oblivion.It's a rather highly unlikely plot, where the secret service(s) wait till the last moment as the pick someone straight out of the crowd (!) , blackmail him that they'll kill his daughter should he not succumb to a deal where he has to go and kill the governor in a rally about to take place. Now you need as a viewer to get past this before you can begin enjoying the film. If, that is, and that's an &quot;if&quot; that comes with major complications. But back to the plot: what we have here is basically a major joke of an idea. the secret service and security of the governor's rally are all involved in the assasination plot, but since this is so major why would they wait till the last moment to find an assasin even if he needed be a patsy? And how would they have guaranteed results by simply picking him out of a crowd in a station??? This guy could've been a psycho, he could've been a cop, he could've been vasically anybody who wouldnt fit the schem not to mention they dont even check whether this guy can even shoot at all, let alone if he ever held a gun in his hands. Nope, it's as if all this doesn't matter. Yet, the picked patsy (J.Depp) goes along rather easily with the blackmail, which by the way only becomes convincing much, much later in the film, and then more absurdities begin to rain down on us:the agent who's responsible for putting the whole scheme in motion (Walken) has to be omnipresent to make sure that the the patsy doesnt talk to anyone or doesnt try anything that would put the whole plot in jeopardy. This alone becomes almost comedic at times as Walken is following Depp around coaching him (&quot;go and do your job now&quot; or &quot;dont mess up again&quot; etc etc...) and all the time along Depp tries various methods of revealing the plot to someone or trying to escape to get his daughter back...And everytime Walken gets him back on track with the same monotonous &quot;admonition&quot;: &quot;go do what you're told&quot;.The funniest part of that &quot;plot&quot; is where Depp finds a shoeshiner to whom he starts revealing the whole thing but then he passes him off to Walken as deaf even though Walken has been seeing him actually talk at length to the shoeshiner...That's basically where the whole thing falls apart completely..Still, and considering what kind of faulty plot we're dealing with here, the movie does work. That would be mainly because of Walken's everconvincing performance as well as Depp's but on a secondary level.Walken, is simply a joy to watch as he pulls off the tough merciless guy role in imposing fashion. He always does actually regardless of role. Depp follows to par without overimpressing really but without letting Walken alone in his task to carry the movie.The 2 actors are the primary reason to watch this. Other than that, turn off your cerebrum because if you don't you might not make it through.
