820282,AMTWN5EVLJYNL,B00020HCBI,Amazon Customer,"[5, 6]","Even though this is the weakest season of the Highlander Series I give this 5 stars because of the finale to the series, the episodes ""To be"" and ""Not to be"", these are classics now for all the HL fans and to having ended the series with the touching notes of ""Bonny Portmore"" made us all celebrate the saga and life of Duncan Macleod. And being too an autoracing buff, for me it was a positive surprise that they had included the feature of ""La carrera Panamericana"", Adrian Paul is not a great driver but it was interesting to watch how a team is readied for a race and it was exciting to follow the teams thru all Mexico.

820283,A3CAKJ3YWDOLMW,B00020HCBI,"C. Duarte ""Amazon_Bard""","[0, 0]","Season six of Highlander the series was a short, but sweet 12 episodes. This season is also a little short on my favorite Immortal, Duncan MacLeod. There are four episodes, `Sins of the Father', `Patient Number 7', `Justice', and `Two Hearts', where the powers that be tested the water for a female lead spin-off (which was eventually the Immortal Amanda as the Raven) also, there are a few episodes with just a little bit of Duncan, or a mention that Duncan is in London while Methos and Joe take the lead (not that I think this is a bad thing). There is also an appearance of the Immortal Huge Fitzcairn (Roger Daltrey) in this season, and as usual he steals the show with his great comedic timing!These episodes, with the exception of the before mentioned details, are very well written and the acting is great. I really have enjoyed re-watching these episodes (as I'd only seen them once before). The extras are very entertaining to me; I really enjoy getting to see the behind the scene stuff and I love to hear what the stars and production people have to say about working on episodes that I enjoy so much.All in all I think this is a perfect DVD box set, it's a great one to own, and I recommend it for anyone who likes a good action/sci-fi/comedy/drama type flick!",5,"Short, but Sweet!",1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,1273,"['Season', 'six', 'Highlander', 'series', 'was', 'short', 'sweet', '12', 'episodes', 'season', 'also', 'little', 'short', 'favorite', 'Immortal', 'Duncan', 'MacLeod', 'are', 'four', 'episodes', 'Sins', 'Father', 'Patient', 'Number', '7', 'Justice', 'Two', 'Hearts', 'where', 'powers', 'be', 'tested', 'water', 'female', 'lead', 'spin-off', 'was', 'eventually', 'Immortal', 'Amanda', 'Raven', 'also', 'are', 'few', 'episodes', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'Duncan', 'mention', 'Duncan', 'London', 'Methos', 'Joe', 'take', 'lead', 'not', 'think', 'bad', 'thing', 'also', 'appearance', 'Immortal', 'Huge', 'Fitzcairn', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'season', 'as', 'usual', 'show', 'great', 'comedic', 'timing', 'episodes', 'exception', 'before', 'mentioned', 'details', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'acting', 'great', 'really', 'have', 'enjoyed', 're-watching', 'episodes', ""'d"", 'only', 'seen', 'once', 'before', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'really', 'enjoy', 'getting', 'see', 'scene', 'stuff', 'love', 'hear', 'what', 'stars', 'production', 'people', 'have', 'say', 'working', 'episodes', 'enjoy', 'so', 'much.All', 'think', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'great', 'one', 'own', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'action/sci-fi/comedy/drama', 'type', 'flick']",Highlander The Series - Season 6

820285,A1QEPR4JT9D1SH,B00020HCBI,dirrtycruz,"[6, 6]","The Highlander TV Show debuted well over a decade ago, and since then it has been embraced by fans across the world.  The audience views the wicked world of Immortals through the eyes of Duncan MacLeod, who is played by Adrian Paul.  Many of us have read stories about Mortal and Immortal in schools, but never really contemplated on the issue of life vs. death and staying vs. continuing.  These are the themes depicted in Highlander and they are what caught my attention when I first started watching the show.Season 6 once again built upon these themes and used the concepts to develop the characters even further.  As the Highlander TV Series ended with Season 6, the storyline was tied with much passion, sadness, action, and emotion.  This Season started with MacLeod finally defeated Ahriman, a demonic presence that confused MacLeod to the point of accidentally killing Richie Ryan at the end of Season 5.  Like its regulars, MacLeod fought off others with his swords for his life.  Although these fights lacked the strength of choreograph as in previous Seasons, they were still very entertaining.The first two episodes, ""Avatar"" and ""Armageddon"" were integral to the plot as they pretty much presented the ""ending"" to Highlander.  In ""Armageddon,"" MacLeod's rivalry was intensified.  Moreover, with the help of Father Beaufort and Joe Dawson, MacLeod begins to find a crack in Evil's armor.  However, they soon learn that anyone who helps the Champion becomes fair game for the demon.  This was one of my favorite episodes from the final Season because the characters had to struggle with guilt as they came to face their own demons.  The highlighted scene belonged to MacLeod's wrestles with Ahriman in the final battle.  For the remaining episodes, the writers presented glimpses of how MacLeod's friends and lovers would have been without him.Although Season 6 offered fewer episodes, the bonus video interviews with various behind-the-scenes were such special treats.  In addition, several episodes have audio and video commentaries that allow the viewers to get a better understand of the show's plot and production.  If you are a true fan of the show, then you will really enjoy the Finale Backstage Documentary and Immortal Memories Featurettes.",5,Highlander's Great Ending,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,2262,"['Highlander', 'TV', 'Show', 'debuted', 'well', 'decade', 'ago', 'then', 'been', 'embraced', 'fans', 'world', 'audience', 'wicked', 'world', 'Immortals', 'eyes', 'Duncan', 'MacLeod', 'who', 'played', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'Many', 'have', 'read', 'stories', 'Mortal', 'Immortal', 'schools', 'never', 'really', 'contemplated', 'issue', 'life', 'vs.', 'death', 'staying', 'vs.', 'continuing', 'are', 'themes', 'depicted', 'Highlander', 'are', 'what', 'caught', 'attention', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'show.Season', '6', 'once', 'again', 'built', 'themes', 'used', 'concepts', 'develop', 'characters', 'even', 'further', 'Highlander', 'TV', 'Series', 'ended', 'Season', '6', 'storyline', 'was', 'tied', 'much', 'passion', 'sadness', 'action', 'emotion', 'Season', 'started', 'MacLeod', 'finally', 'defeated', 'Ahriman', 'demonic', 'presence', 'confused', 'MacLeod', 'point', 'accidentally', 'killing', 'Richie', 'Ryan', 'end', 'Season', '5', 'regulars', 'MacLeod', 'fought', 'off', 'others', 'swords', 'life', 'fights', 'lacked', 'strength', 'choreograph', 'previous', 'Seasons', 'were', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining.The', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'Avatar', 'Armageddon', 'were', 'integral', 'plot', 'pretty', 'much', 'presented', 'ending', 'Highlander', 'Armageddon', 'MacLeod', 'rivalry', 'was', 'intensified', 'Moreover', 'help', 'Father', 'Beaufort', 'Joe', 'Dawson', 'MacLeod', 'find', 'crack', 'Evil', 'armor', 'However', 'soon', 'learn', 'anyone', 'who', 'Champion', 'fair', 'game', 'demon', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'final', 'Season', 'characters', 'had', 'struggle', 'guilt', 'came', 'face', 'own', 'demons', 'highlighted', 'scene', 'belonged', 'MacLeod', 'wrestles', 'Ahriman', 'final', 'battle', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'writers', 'presented', 'glimpses', 'how', 'MacLeod', 'friends', 'lovers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'him.Although', 'Season', '6', 'offered', 'fewer', 'episodes', 'bonus', 'video', 'interviews', 'various', 'behind-the-scenes', 'were', 'such', 'special', 'treats', 'addition', 'several', 'episodes', 'have', 'audio', 'video', 'commentaries', 'allow', 'viewers', 'get', 'better', 'understand', 'show', 'plot', 'production', 'are', 'true', 'fan', 'show', 'then', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Finale', 'Backstage', 'Documentary', 'Immortal', 'Memories', 'Featurettes']",Highlander The Series - Season 6
820286,A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA,B00020HCBI,Ervin Griffin,"[3, 3]","Season 6 of Highlander was easily the weakest of the seasons BUT it does have its moments.Let me say that the first two episodes ""Avatar"" and ""Armaggedon"" did not fit the Highlander world at all though I can respect what they were trying to do. Have the immortal scottsman Duncan Macleod face off with the ULTIMATE immortal Arimon (aka Satan to me).As a man who was brought up in a Christian home, that part of me could appreciate what it was trying to do. Have Duncan defeat the ultimate evil but how without using his usual weapons (his military experience, martial arts, his famous dragon-head Katana sword)? As a Highlander fan, it just didn't fit into this world at all. I know its science-fiction but its Sci-Fi that's grounded in reality. This one went more to the left than usual.As for the rest of the season, most of the episodes were average at best though I did like ""Unusual Suspects"" (a comedy episode with Roger Daltry) and the one where its just Methos and Joe Dawson in an episode.The reason to get this season at all is the final two episodes called ""To Be..."" and ""Or Not To Be"". They, at least, let Highlander: The Series end on a high note. Otherwise, its pretty much a ""casting call"" for female actors for the eventual spin-off Highlander: The Raven. I've never seen it so I won't comment on it but most slam it as bad!Back to this season, it isn't a total waste of money but I wouldn't pay no more than $30 for it!

If you're a completest then I'd say now's the time to add the final season set to your dvd library just don't expect this season to match up to the last five seasons though....",3,While Enjoyed The Series Overall The Season 5 finale And The Entire Season Six Really Let Me Down,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,856,"['was', 'show', 'obviously', 'had', 'take', 'great', 'deal', 'salt', 'cast', 'stories', 'most', 'shoe', 'more', 'then', 'made', 'up', 'Sadly', 'ridiculous', 'season', '5', 'finale', 'story', 'just', 'felt', 'writers', 'producers', 'were', 'just', 'looking', 'end', 'final', 'season', 'highest', 'note', 'possible', 'terrible', 'story', 'arc', 'Season', 'six', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'episodes', 'just', 'felt', 'greatly', 'diluted', 'entertainment', 'what', 'saw', 'last', 'five', 'previous', 'seasons', 'show', 'also', 'just', 'felt', 'main', 'actor', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'just', 'finishing', 'up', 'last', 'season', 'then', 'bringing', 'back', 'feeling', 'excitement', 'series', ""'re"", 'completest', 'then', ""'d"", 'say', 'now', 'time', 'add', 'final', 'season', 'set', 'dvd', 'library', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'season', 'match', 'up', 'last', 'five', 'seasons']",Highlander The Series - Season 6

Nelson ""www.sewerden.com""","[43, 45]","Although this season provides a nice ending to the series in the form of the two-part final episode - which is really a sort of It's a Wonderfull life-like reflection of the entire series, by and large this season was used as a ""proving ground"" for the female lead character they were looking for to headline the series ""The Raven"".So a good number of the episodes in this half-season were taken up focusing on various other immortals.  Not that that was such a bad thing as by-and-large I think they were decent episodes, but Duncan really isn't in them much, if at all.  In fact, in the extras on the DVDs that's one of the things mentioned frequently - that Adrian Paul wasn't as available this season as he had been before - that he wanted to bring the series to a close for whatever reason, etc.All that being said, this is still a somewhat important season in the series as Duncan comes to terms with his actions in previous seasons - the killing by his own hands - and the character goes through an important transition.  For that reason alone, you might want to consider this season.  Even still, when standing this season up against seasons 2,3 and 4, this one pales in comparison.",3,Weakest of all 6 seasons,1100822400,"11 19, 2004",2004,1190,"['season', 'nice', 'ending', 'series', 'form', 'two-part', 'final', 'episode', 'really', 'sort', 'Wonderfull', 'life-like', 'reflection', 'entire', 'series', 'large', 'season', 'was', 'used', 'proving', 'ground', 'female', 'lead', 'character', 'were', 'looking', 'headline', 'series', 'Raven', 'good', 'number', 'episodes', 'half-season', 'were', 'taken', 'up', 'focusing', 'various', 'other', 'immortals', 'Not', 'was', 'such', 'bad', 'thing', 'by-and-large', 'think', 'were', 'decent', 'episodes', 'Duncan', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'fact', 'extras', 'DVDs', 'one', 'things', 'mentioned', 'frequently', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'available', 'season', 'had', 'been', 'wanted', 'bring', 'series', 'close', 'reason', 'etc.All', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'somewhat', 'important', 'season', 'series', 'Duncan', 'terms', 'actions', 'previous', 'seasons', 'killing', 'own', 'hands', 'character', 'important', 'transition', 'reason', 'alone', 'might', 'want', 'consider', 'season', 'Even', 'still', 'when', 'standing', 'season', 'up', 'seasons', '2,3', '4', 'one', 'comparison']",Highlander The Series - Season 6

Okay so as a female, I do prefer Adrian Paul and some of the episodes did not have him in them at all. I think they should have either stopped with season 5 or continued the theme that they had started in the previous seasons, depicting the life of the &#34;Highlander, Duncan MacLeod&#34; not other immortals only.  The story line for the final couple episodes were very forced. As with the ending of Season 5 if you just want to finish the series it is something to watch (kind of like getting 3/4 of the way through a book and forcing yourself to finish).",2,Not like any other season,1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,623,"['last', 'season', 'was', 'extremely', 'different', 'other', 'season', 'Okay', 'so', 'female', 'do', 'prefer', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'episodes', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'stopped', 'season', '5', 'continued', 'theme', 'had', 'started', 'previous', 'seasons', 'depicting', 'life', '34', 'Highlander', 'Duncan', 'MacLeod', '34', 'not', 'other', 'immortals', 'only', 'story', 'line', 'final', 'couple', 'episodes', 'were', 'very', 'forced', 'ending', 'Season', '5', 'just', 'want', 'finish', 'series', 'something', 'watch', 'kind', 'getting', '3/4', 'way', 'book', 'forcing', 'finish']",Highlander The Series - Season 6
820300,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00020HCBI,Tom Benton,"[18, 20]","For ""Highlander"" fans everywhere, season six was a major disappointment.  It started out bad, and it didn't get much better.Picking up where season five left off, the finale season of the series begins with ""Avatar"", which has got to be one of the worst episodes of the show.  When you see Duncan cover his ears and go berserk at the sound of rock music, then rip the stereo out of the car, all for no apparent reason - you know you're in trouble.  Luckily for us, the 5,000-year-old Zoroastrian space demon behind these horrible episodes went poof in the next episode, ""Armageddon"".  One of the biggest problems with season six is that half the episodes are used as ""backdoor pilots"" for a spin-off show - that is, episodes that use MacLeod for as little as thirty seconds and which feature a female immortal as the main character.  The episodes which do star MacLeod suffer from horrible writing, namely ""Black Tower"", which is probably the worst episode of the whole show.Season six did have a few good moments, though.  The first of these was ""Justice"", an Agatha Christie-ish flashback episode in which Duncan sets out to find the culprit behind the ""murder"" of Hugh Fitzcairn (played by Roger Daltrey).  Then there's ""Indiscretions"", in which everyone's favorite buddies, Joe and Methos, finally get their own episode.  The greatest part of the season however was the two-episode finale, ""To Be"" and ""Not to Be"", which draws obvious inspiration from Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"".Well, maybe if Adrian Paul hadn't had his hair cut for this season, the show might have ended better.  Then again, maybe he wouldn't have received his paycheck and the show wouldn't have ended at all.  Which still might be better than this.Season six is strictly for die-hard fans of the show, or those looking to complete their ""Highlander"" collection.  It's an astonishingly bad season and an unfitting demise to a great show.",3,An astonishingly bad season and an unfitting demise.,1107993600,"02 10, 2005",2005,1922,"['Highlander', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'season', 'six', 'was', 'major', 'disappointment', 'started', 'out', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better.Picking', 'up', 'where', 'season', 'five', 'left', 'off', 'finale', 'season', 'series', 'Avatar', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'episodes', 'show', 'When', 'see', 'Duncan', 'cover', 'ears', 'go', 'berserk', 'sound', 'rock', 'music', 'then', 'stereo', 'car', 'apparent', 'reason', 'know', ""'re"", 'trouble', 'Luckily', '5,000-year-old', 'Zoroastrian', 'space', 'demon', 'horrible', 'episodes', 'went', 'poof', 'next', 'episode', 'Armageddon', 'One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'season', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'used', 'backdoor', 'pilots', 'spin-off', 'show', 'episodes', 'use', 'MacLeod', 'as', 'little', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'feature', 'female', 'immortal', 'main', 'character', 'episodes', 'do', 'star', 'MacLeod', 'suffer', 'horrible', 'writing', 'namely', 'Black', 'Tower', 'probably', 'worst', 'episode', 'whole', 'show.Season', 'six', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'good', 'moments', 'though', 'first', 'was', 'Justice', 'Agatha', 'Christie-ish', 'flashback', 'episode', 'Duncan', 'out', 'find', 'culprit', 'murder', 'Hugh', 'Fitzcairn', 'played', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'Then', 'Indiscretions', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'buddies', 'Joe', 'Methos', 'finally', 'get', 'own', 'episode', 'greatest', 'part', 'season', 'however', 'was', 'two-episode', 'finale', 'Be', 'Not', 'Be', 'obvious', 'inspiration', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Wonderful', 'Life', '.Well', 'maybe', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'hair', 'cut', 'season', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'ended', 'better', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'received', 'paycheck', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'ended', 'Which', 'still', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'this.Season', 'six', 'strictly', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'show', 'looking', 'complete', 'Highlander', 'collection', 'astonishingly', 'bad', 'season', 'unfitting', 'demise', 'great', 'show']",Highlander The Series - Season 6
