Dr Gannon's cool under fire demeanor sets the standard for smarts--setting his patients on the positive track to recovery--physical and emotional.  There's no need for bloody scenes and foul language to ""wake-up-your-viewers"" with scripts like Med Center--and season 3 kicks'it up a notch.  Product of a time when script writers actually used their brains to build suspense.  Try to find that anywhere on TV today.  Warner Archives:  YOU ROCK!!! Keep'em coming!!",4,Brilliant Scripts!

We watch a lot of old time movies/series on DVD and this is always one that I like to take off the shelf again and again. Chad Everett's acting skills are amazing and the show's cast is usually great as well! We had trouble with the second season, because some of the episodes would freeze up or wouldn't work at all. :-/ But except for a brief pause on a few of the episodes in this third season, we enjoyed it immensely. :) Definitely recommend buying this if you like Chad Everett and lots of action.",5,Love This!,1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,610,"['have', 'First', 'Second', 'seasons', 'show', 'one', 'favorite', 'top', 'five', 'television', 'series', 'watch', 'lot', 'old', 'time', 'movies/series', 'DVD', 'always', 'one', 'like', 'take', 'off', 'shelf', 'again', 'again', 'Chad', 'Everett', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'amazing', 'show', 'cast', 'usually', 'great', 'well', 'had', 'trouble', 'second', 'season', 'episodes', 'would', 'freeze', 'up', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', '-/', 'brief', 'pause', 'few', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'Definitely', 'recommend', 'buying', 'like', 'Chad', 'Everett', 'lots', 'action']",Medical Center: The Complete Third Season

Each episode has brought controversial 1970's topics to the forefront with great acting from all, and again the OR scenes are very real. Chad Everett and James Daly remain the stars, and seem to bring a depth of compassion and reality to all of the episodes.  I love the Third season, but as a huge and dedicated fan of one Chad Everett, I could be said to be a tad biased.
