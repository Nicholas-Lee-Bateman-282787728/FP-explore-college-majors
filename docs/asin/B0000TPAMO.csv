783525,ACBFF25XJC2T7,B0000TPAMO,Choice Critic,"[5, 5]","This documentary film by Robert Stone is rife with the naive arrogance of US governmental officials as they explored the use of the atomic bomb for future nuclear war after WWII. In 1946 the US government involuntarily relocated the inhabitants of the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands  to another Polynesian island.  The government then conducted two atomic tests, dropping one atomic bomb on the atoll and exploding another in the ocean.The film of a baby goat (what a metaphor!) that survived one of the explosions arouses pity and will make you wish it had died. It was harnessed on one of the target ghost ships. An interview with the Bikini islander's ""king"", Kilon Bauno, shows the advantage taken of the displaced islanders.  The interview with ex-seaman, John Smitherman, shows the appalling human cost of the ignorance which exposed thousands of US sailors to large amounts of radioactive fallout. There is even a snippet of Alfred Einstein being co-opted into saying only ""I agree"" to a self-serving statement read by a government spokesman.Smith ingeniously used the government's own footage, originally compiled for the production of a propaganda film extolling the virtues of the tests, to make a pungent criticism of the damage caused by the ignorance, naivete, and arrogance of the US government. The government dropped all plans to make its film after it realized the magnitude of the destruction it caused to the vegetation and human and animal life, and made the island uninhabitable for years. The footage was discreetly archived until Smith did his research.The decision to exclude narration from the film was a brilliant approach by Smith.  Watching the government's own representatives rationalize the tests beforehand, then showing the tests and their results without comment, is all that is needed to convey the horrendous unintended consequences of the tests.  This film was Smith's first documentary and received an Academy Award nomination in 1988.  The islanders had still not returned at that time because of the radioactive poisons remaining on the island.",4,The Arrogance and Ignorance of Power,1245456000,"06 20, 2009",2009,2090,"['documentary', 'film', 'Robert', 'Stone', 'rife', 'naive', 'arrogance', 'US', 'governmental', 'officials', 'explored', 'use', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'future', 'nuclear', 'war', 'WWII', '1946', 'US', 'government', 'involuntarily', 'relocated', 'inhabitants', 'Bikini', 'Atoll', 'Marshall', 'Islands', 'Polynesian', 'island', 'government', 'then', 'conducted', 'two', 'atomic', 'tests', 'dropping', 'one', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'atoll', 'exploding', 'ocean.The', 'film', 'baby', 'goat', 'what', 'metaphor', 'survived', 'one', 'explosions', 'pity', 'will', 'make', 'wish', 'had', 'died', 'was', 'harnessed', 'one', 'target', 'ghost', 'ships', 'interview', 'Bikini', 'islander', 'king', 'Kilon', 'Bauno', 'advantage', 'taken', 'displaced', 'islanders', 'interview', 'ex-seaman', 'John', 'Smitherman', 'appalling', 'human', 'cost', 'ignorance', 'exposed', 'thousands', 'US', 'sailors', 'large', 'amounts', 'radioactive', 'fallout', 'even', 'snippet', 'Alfred', 'Einstein', 'being', 'co-opted', 'saying', 'only', 'agree', 'self-serving', 'statement', 'read', 'government', 'spokesman.Smith', 'ingeniously', 'used', 'government', 'own', 'footage', 'originally', 'compiled', 'production', 'propaganda', 'film', 'extolling', 'virtues', 'tests', 'make', 'pungent', 'criticism', 'damage', 'caused', 'ignorance', 'naivete', 'arrogance', 'US', 'government', 'government', 'dropped', 'plans', 'make', 'film', 'realized', 'magnitude', 'destruction', 'caused', 'vegetation', 'human', 'animal', 'life', 'made', 'island', 'uninhabitable', 'years', 'footage', 'was', 'discreetly', 'archived', 'Smith', 'did', 'research.The', 'decision', 'exclude', 'narration', 'film', 'was', 'brilliant', 'approach', 'Smith', 'Watching', 'government', 'own', 'representatives', 'rationalize', 'tests', 'beforehand', 'then', 'showing', 'tests', 'results', 'comment', 'needed', 'convey', 'horrendous', 'unintended', 'consequences', 'tests', 'film', 'was', 'Smith', 'first', 'documentary', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', '1988', 'islanders', 'had', 'still', 'not', 'returned', 'time', 'radioactive', 'poisons', 'remaining', 'island']",N/A

783527,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0000TPAMO,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 6]","What I found interesting about this documentary is the glimpse it gives us of the state of mind of the United States just after World War II, now sixty years past.  We see in the newsreel and other film footage the style and substance of America in the afterglow of our greatest victory.  But mostly we see ordinary soldiers and sailors who were stationed on or near the Bikini Atoll in the Marshalls in the South Pacific.  We also see some of the islanders whom the United States military displaced so that the capabilities of the atom bomb could be explored.An old uneducated Bikini islander recalls how his people were told that in the interest of ""science"" (but actually in the interest of weapons development) they would have to leave their home island and be relocated.  Then at some point they were told that they would not be able to return to their island since it was ""poisoned.""Film maker Robert Stone shows us the big media build up orchestrated by the US to justify dropping the bomb on Bikini.  (Actually one bomb was dropped.  Another was exploded under water in the Bikini lagoon.)  Dignitaries and scientists from all over the world were invited to watch.  Stone shows them arriving and being greeted by the officer in charge as a voice-over gives their names, country of origin and their titles.  I found that interesting.  Two from India, a couple from the USSR, some Asians, and many more.  Ah, yes, the US was going to make the world safe from nuclear power by experimenting with nuclear power.Or some such argument.  I thought the dignitaries were positively drooling.  Not drooling were the goats and sheep (sheared so that the scientists could see the effects of the radiation on their bare skin) who were trapped in little stalls aboard strategically placed ships near the island.  Also not drooling, but having a good time were the sailors who with dark glasses viewed the blast from some safe distance on their ships.  They were happy because it looked like an easy duty, and were told that there was no danger.  Radiation was never mentioned, and in those days, the dangers of radiation were only just becoming public knowledge.  Stone has footage of an interview with one of the sailors years later, only his head and shoulders shown for most of the documentary until near the end when the camera retreats a little and we can see what grotesque things the radiation poisoning did to him.  It's pretty shocking footage, and you won't forget it.We see the blasts and the mushroom clouds and the magnificent glory of the power of the bomb.  Unfortunately some observers were down wind and radioactive dust fell upon them.  Unfortunately some observers boarded the ships that suffered damage from the blasts (but were far enough away so as not to be destroyed) and got radioactive dust on their clothes and skin.  Stone shows the sailors exploring the damage while being scanned by Geiger counters going crazy monitoring the radiation.  One is struck by the innocence and playfulness of the sailors as the radiation begins its work on their bodies.In other words this is a snapshot from the dawn of the nuclear age, strangely innocent and diabolical at the same time.  I don't think this is a great documentary, but I will say it is effective.  For the complete story of what happened at the Bikini Atoll and especially what happened to the islanders who lost their homes and to those exposed to the radiation, the viewer will have to look elsewhere.

783528,ANPCOOQW2YAIG,B0000TPAMO,Dustin,"[20, 29]","&#34;The Most Terrifying and Unbelievable Story of the Nuclear Age.&#34;That's what the quote on the cover of the DVD says. Unfortunately, I don't think the DVD quite lives up to these expectations. (Why can't we just have good cover art instead of shameless fluffy quotes?)In my book, the first bomb drops on Japan (Justified or not) must be the most terrifying. Those awoke the world to the power man has created. If not those, the future explosions and deployment in the MEGATON range must be the most terrifying. (The bombs dropped on Japan and FIRST tested in Bikini atoll were no more than 21 Kilotons).I found the released footage fascinating in showing our naivete of our attitudes toward nuclear weapons at the time. The zoom out of a former sailor talking earlier than showing his hand is good too, though when put in context of what happened to those in Japan, not surprising. (I have been to Hiroshima (and Los Alamos area and museum) - which might affect my perception of this film too, in other words if one doesn't know much about nuclear history they might rate it higher)Interviews with Bikini atoll native is good too, but I don't believe the author ever mentions that &#60;200 people (167 from what I've read elsewhere) were moved / affected. Which in the scheme of mass death during WW2, isn't a high number.  Although the movie Star Trek: Insurrection comes to mind (Which talks about how many people is too much to &#34;sacrifice&#34; for a goal).  A map showing the blasts in relation to the Atoll would have been good too for perspective.This is where I feel the movie failed a bit, it didn't do enough to express the context of the times. While there are clips of the end of WW2 and various clips from government officials after, I think it could have been tied together better.Some more discussion on the irony of coming out of WW2 with all its death and destruction then blowing up a tropical paradise would be good. Also, brief discussion on other Bikini Atoll blasts would have been good.On a final positive note - using the perspective of sailors in describing the events is good.Worth watching, but don't have too high expectations. Atomic Journeys narrated by William Shatner is worth watching too.[...] has a ton of good info on the subject too.As an aside, a good place to visit in the US is the Titan Missle Museum near Tucson, Arizona. Fully intact missle silo with 100 foot missle. Formerly armed with 9 megaton (600x more powerful than each bomb on Japan) nuclear warhead. I believe this is the largest size nuclear warhead the US deployed. We did test a 15 Megaton blast unexpectedly though on Bikini. The Russians tested even larger ones supposedly.The follies of man. &#60;smile&#62;",3,"Illuminating footage, but doesn't live up to hype",1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,2724,"['34', 'Most', 'Terrifying', 'Unbelievable', 'Story', 'Nuclear', 'Age.', '34', 'what', 'quote', 'cover', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'DVD', 'quite', 'up', 'expectations', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'have', 'good', 'cover', 'art', 'instead', 'shameless', 'fluffy', 'quotes', 'book', 'first', 'bomb', 'drops', 'Japan', 'Justified', 'not', 'must', 'be', 'most', 'terrifying', 'world', 'power', 'man', 'created', 'not', 'future', 'explosions', 'deployment', 'MEGATON', 'range', 'must', 'be', 'most', 'terrifying', 'bombs', 'dropped', 'Japan', 'FIRST', 'tested', 'Bikini', 'atoll', 'were', 'more', '21', 'Kilotons', '.I', 'found', 'released', 'footage', 'fascinating', 'showing', 'naivete', 'attitudes', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'time', 'zoom', 'former', 'sailor', 'talking', 'earlier', 'showing', 'hand', 'good', 'too', 'when', 'put', 'context', 'what', 'happened', 'Japan', 'not', 'surprising', 'have', 'been', 'Hiroshima', 'Los', 'Alamos', 'area', 'museum', 'might', 'affect', 'perception', 'film', 'too', 'other', 'words', 'one', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'nuclear', 'history', 'might', 'rate', 'higher', 'Bikini', 'atoll', 'native', 'good', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'author', 'ever', 'mentions', '60', '200', 'people', '167', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'elsewhere', 'were', 'moved', '/', 'affected', 'Which', 'scheme', 'mass', 'death', 'WW2', ""n't"", 'high', 'number', 'movie', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Insurrection', 'mind', 'Which', 'talks', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'too', 'much', '34', 'sacrifice', '34', 'goal', 'map', 'showing', 'blasts', 'relation', 'Atoll', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'too', 'perspective.This', 'where', 'feel', 'movie', 'failed', 'bit', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'enough', 'express', 'context', 'times', 'are', 'clips', 'end', 'WW2', 'various', 'clips', 'government', 'officials', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tied', 'together', 'better.Some', 'more', 'discussion', 'irony', 'coming', 'WW2', 'death', 'destruction', 'then', 'blowing', 'up', 'tropical', 'paradise', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'Also', 'brief', 'discussion', 'other', 'Bikini', 'Atoll', 'blasts', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'final', 'positive', 'note', 'using', 'perspective', 'sailors', 'describing', 'events', 'good.Worth', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'high', 'expectations', 'Atomic', 'Journeys', 'narrated', 'William', 'Shatner', 'worth', 'watching', 'too.', '[', ']', 'ton', 'good', 'info', 'subject', 'aside', 'good', 'place', 'visit', 'US', 'Titan', 'Missle', 'Museum', 'Tucson', 'Arizona', 'Fully', 'intact', 'missle', 'silo', '100', 'foot', 'missle', 'Formerly', 'armed', '9', 'megaton', '600x', 'more', 'powerful', 'bomb', 'Japan', 'nuclear', 'warhead', 'believe', 'largest', 'size', 'nuclear', 'warhead', 'US', 'deployed', 'did', 'test', '15', 'Megaton', 'blast', 'unexpectedly', 'Bikini', 'Russians', 'tested', 'even', 'larger', 'ones', 'supposedly.The', 'follies', 'man', '60', 'smile', '62']",N/A

If you want to learn history, read a book.&quot; - -  Robert StoneRobert Stone's Academy Award-nominated documentary, Radio Bikini, teaches history by presenting the story of the 1946 atomic bomb tests in the Marshall Islands using US government film.  With hundreds of cameras recording the blasts in the Bikini Atoll, Operation Crossroads must have been the most extensively recorded event in history up to that time.The story of smiling sailors before the test (putting animals in cages to test anti-radiation substances, drinking 3-2 beer, playing volleyball) alternates with the reminiscences of a sailor who suffered horrendous effects after returning to the area of the blast.The chief of the island describes the day the Navy came and told him the United States needed to move his people and destroy their home.  He'd never even seen a motion picture camera before that day.Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov spars with US representative Bernard Baruch at the United Nations about which country has more peaceful intentions for the atom.  Protesters march against the Bikini tests.Stone's comment on film vs. history quoted above is misleading.  He doesn't take the Jerry Bruckheimer approach to filmmaking (Blackhawk Down, Pearl Harbor) that dismisses historical accuracy in favor of an exciting story.  He's just aware of the shortcomings of film to explain an historical event.  (The interview with Stone included on the DVD is very interesting.)Radio Bikini proves that film can show the truth, even if it can't show the whole truth.  The physical effects of the Bikini tests we see are real.  Cameras don't have to (as they often do in the age of embedded reporters) lie by showing the exultation of soldiers after combat but turning away from the dead and scarred bodies of soldiers and civilians.(ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION:  If you're interested in how film has treated history, see the Spring 2004 issue of Cineaste.  There's a forty-page supplement with comments by historians like Simon Schama and Eric Hobsbawm and historical filmmakers like John Sayles and Costa Gavras.)",5,Radio(active) Bikini,1090108800,"07 18, 2004",2004,2125,"['quot', ""'m"", 'making', 'film', 'want', 'learn', 'history', 'read', 'book.', 'quot', 'Robert', 'StoneRobert', 'Stone', 'Academy', 'Award-nominated', 'documentary', 'Radio', 'Bikini', 'history', 'presenting', 'story', '1946', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'tests', 'Marshall', 'Islands', 'using', 'US', 'government', 'film', 'hundreds', 'cameras', 'recording', 'blasts', 'Bikini', 'Atoll', 'Operation', 'Crossroads', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'extensively', 'recorded', 'event', 'history', 'up', 'time.The', 'story', 'smiling', 'sailors', 'test', 'putting', 'animals', 'cages', 'test', 'anti-radiation', 'substances', 'drinking', '3-2', 'beer', 'playing', 'volleyball', 'reminiscences', 'sailor', 'who', 'suffered', 'horrendous', 'effects', 'returning', 'area', 'blast.The', 'chief', 'island', 'day', 'Navy', 'came', 'told', 'United', 'States', 'needed', 'move', 'people', 'destroy', 'home', ""'d"", 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'motion', 'picture', 'camera', 'day.Soviet', 'Foreign', 'Minister', 'Vyacheslav', 'Molotov', 'US', 'representative', 'Bernard', 'Baruch', 'United', 'Nations', 'country', 'more', 'peaceful', 'intentions', 'atom', 'Protesters', 'march', 'Bikini', 'tests.Stone', 'comment', 'film', 'vs.', 'history', 'quoted', 'misleading', ""n't"", 'take', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'approach', 'filmmaking', 'Blackhawk', 'Down', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'favor', 'exciting', 'story', 'just', 'aware', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'explain', 'historical', 'event', 'interview', 'Stone', 'included', 'DVD', 'very', 'interesting', 'Radio', 'Bikini', 'film', 'can', 'show', 'truth', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'show', 'whole', 'truth', 'physical', 'effects', 'Bikini', 'see', 'are', 'real', 'Cameras', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'often', 'do', 'age', 'embedded', 'reporters', 'lie', 'showing', 'exultation', 'soldiers', 'combat', 'turning', 'away', 'dead', 'scarred', 'bodies', 'soldiers', 'civilians', 'ADDITIONAL', 'RECOMMENDATION', ""'re"", 'interested', 'how', 'film', 'treated', 'history', 'see', 'Spring', '2004', 'issue', 'Cineaste', 'forty-page', 'supplement', 'comments', 'historians', 'Simon', 'Schama', 'Eric', 'Hobsbawm', 'historical', 'filmmakers', 'John', 'Sayles', 'Costa', 'Gavras']",N/A

However, after seeing the price of this movie, I knew I had to attain it by more devious means.  I would not suggest to anyone to buy this movie for $350.00. I'm sure other movies exists with just as much information, Trinity and Beyond, was the best nuclear bomb testing movie I've seen yet, and it contains the most interesting scenes from the Bikini islands anyway.This movie was probably excellent in it day.  Much of the atomic bomb detonations and video were deemed classified at that time, so it was rare and exceptional to see such documentation on the actual projects they conducted in the islands. However, the film itself and the narration isn't that great, the video is of course old, but appears in much better quality in other newer films such as Trinity and Beyond the Bomb movie.There aren't many interesting scenes in the movie. One short odd scene shows Albert Einstein, hunched over in a seemingly tormented slouch voicing one word in support of nuclear exploration.  Some of the soldiers talk about their experience there,  but there is a lack of emotion and impact in them. The best part of the movie is the man with the huge arm and how calmly and not flustered he talks about his deterioration over the decades after being present at the atomic bomb tests.
