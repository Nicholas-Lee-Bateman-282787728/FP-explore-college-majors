Death falls in love while sparing a 64-year old CEO his life for a few days  before his big 65th birthday.  This film is an emotional roller coaster  ride which keeps you hanging and wondering what will happen next.  It is  one of the few films that is like reading a great novel.  Critics shunned  this film when it was released as they did with Wizard of Oz when it was  first released in 1939 and unforunately,Meet Joe Black was a box-office  failure and did not get nominated for any academy awards.  1998's best  picture was Shakespeare In Love which was good but not best picture worthy  to me.  If you like films similar to Harold and Maude or Gone With the Wind  please dont count out this one.  To me this film should have won best  picture of 1998 and beaten Titanic with 13 awards.  Brad Pit is charming.  Claire Forlaine is gorgeous.  Anthony Hopkins is outstanding.  Rent or buy  this film today.  You or your friends will not be disappointed.",5,Meet Joe Black,944524800,"12 7, 1999",1999,1097,"['Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'what', 'love', 'death', 'are', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'DEATH', 'took', 'holiday', 'film', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'Death', 'love', 'sparing', '64-year', 'old', 'CEO', 'life', 'few', 'days', 'big', '65th', 'birthday', 'film', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'hanging', 'wondering', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'reading', 'great', 'novel', 'Critics', 'shunned', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'did', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', '1939', 'unforunately', 'Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'was', 'box-office', 'failure', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'nominated', 'academy', 'awards', '1998', 'best', 'picture', 'was', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'best', 'picture', 'worthy', 'like', 'films', 'similar', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'please', 'dont', 'count', 'one', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'best', 'picture', '1998', 'beaten', 'Titanic', '13', 'awards', 'Brad', 'Pit', 'charming', 'Claire', 'Forlaine', 'gorgeous', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'outstanding', 'Rent', 'buy', 'film', 'today', 'friends', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

I caught no human interest in this flick, even though with all the strings cuing me to tear up, I sure as hell felt there should have been. This film comprises a series of vignettes built to tug on your heartstrings the way the Babysitters Club tugs on Brenda the Brace-Face from homeroom. This is a Disney movie. I have a feeling that the grade schoolers who could sit through it without defecating themselves would love it.But for us adults, we don't get to know the characters enough to actually care for them - they're blank, hobbyless, faultless creatures used as pawns for the kitschy-saccharine climaxes. If you skip through the movie, you'll notice that half of the shots will have two actors trying to look at each other meaningfully (bonus points if they're teared up), the other half sporting someone looking down, bored. This, to me, is a perfect sum up.Not to mention, the plot doesn't make any sense. We never get a feel for what the hell impressed Death so much about Bill's speech about love, after thousands of years of listening to humans, or exactly why he's developing a human side now, rather than in the thousands of other opportunities he's must have had over the course of human history to witness some even sugarier emotional crap (although if you accept the fact that this script was written in a high school drama class as an explanation, it starts to make more sense).I just had an epiphany: this movie would have been great if they had just layered on more slapstick, switching to a sole reliance on the ""guy from outside of civilization really !@#$ing loves peanut butter"" shtick. A fish-out-of-water comedy. ""Death,"" they could have called it. I can see a suited Brad Pitt photoshopped into an ""Elf"" poster right now.

Brad Pitt played a wonderful job as the Spirit of Death (codenamed Joe Black by Anthony Hopkins) inside the body of man who Claire Fontani met in a diner somewhere in New York. Claire is a very beautiful actress and I hope she will do another romantic movie with her charm. For Anthony Hopkins, who plays as a rich CEO of a communications company, has done a good job as a man trying to deal with Joe Black in his house. At first, when Anthony Hopkins hears the voices of death in the beginning, he felt strange but he learns who the person is talking to is in his house and that he is Joe Black. The reason Death is in the body of the man from the diner Susan met is because the man got knocked out in an accident and Death occupies the body because he is on vacation. Joe Black soon gets aquainted with the essence of people and falls for Susan Parrish who was in love with this man who thought Joe was pretty weird with his obsession with peanut butter, jelly cookies, and nice tea. Susan leaves the boyfriend behind and loves Joe Black. However, Joe Black has to deal with Susan's Father's fate, which could be the end of his life during his vacation.

It honestly is a great movie - and I say that as a man not usually fond of films that might be considered ""chick flicks"".  Yes, it is long, but that just means it's not a movie for people with short attention spans.  The length of the movie really doesn't hurt, and in fact, is necessary to flesh out the characters properly.  The acting is superb; the characters seem like real people.  Any film with Anthony Hopkins is worth watching, just to see one of the most gifted actors since Olivier perform.  Brad Pitt manages to hold his own in such exalted company.  And Claire Forlani is simply radiant as the leading actress.Perhaps what I liked best about this movie though, is that despite its length, it evoked the films of the 1930s, which I love.  It's a beautifully filmed movie about high class, wealthy, elegant people of sophisticated tastes and sensibilities (and which shows them as decent people nonetheless, and with problems and issues most people can relate to) - the kind of film that was very popular fare during the years of the Great Depression, but unfortunately the kind of film that hasn't been made for decades.  For me, it was a nostalgic and wonderful throwback to an era of much greater elegance and refinement than today, when people liked to aspire to greater things, rather than being content to reduce things to the lowest common denominator.

Don't be deterred by the long running time, it grabs you and doesn't let go, and the last word to use in describing this film is &quot;boring&quot;.Death comes to call, in the form of smoldering Brad Pitt, on the wise and affluent media mogul Bill Parrish, played by an always-brilliant Anthony Hopkins. If the movie were entirely about their relationship, which goes from hatred and denial to warm humor and father/son almost constantly, it would be enough. For a little extra, however, we're given the charming and stunning Claire Forlani as the compassionate doctor who falls in the love with Death, under the guise of Joe Black (Pitt). The catch: he's in love with her as well, and she's the daughter of Bill, the man who's destined to leave with Death when he tires of live as a man. Cooperate politics, romance, sex, and witty thoughts on life and death complete this fabulous flim, rounding it out into perfection.Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as Bill, conveying every emotion you'd except with absolute genious, and even a suprising touch of warmth and compassion when it comes to his new friend, Death. He steals the show without actually stealing it, leaving plenty of room for Forlani and Pitt to have a complex and intriguing relationship. There are no good guys and bad guys - if there were, you would leave the theater hating Brad Pitt for what he represtents. You simply don't.

First, he takes the life of a charming lawyer (portrayed by Brad Pitt again, of course) and  chooses Bill Parish, a rich tycoon and whom he sees as a perfect example of  a successful human being, to show him the ropes. Bill has no choice because  &quot;Death&quot; told him that he is actually here to claim Bill's life as  his time is almost up, but he will postpone that task so long as he is  enjoying his stay on earth. But &quot;Death&quot; did not prepare himself  to fall in love with Bill's daughter, the lovely Susan (demurely played by  Claire Forlani) and vice versa. Of course, Bill raises hell and objects  strongly when he found out. So, will &quot;Death&quot; get to be together  with Susan in the end or will he have to go away? What will happen to Susan  and Bill? I guess you have to watch the movie to find out. Brad Pitt and  Claire Forlani are beautiful looking and makes a great pair. I'm only  dissapointed by the ending, which left me wondering whether the  lawyer/attorney (killed off earlier in the movie so that &quot;Death&quot;  could take over his body) was brought back to life again or whether  &quot;Death&quot; decided to stay for a while more on earth. I raise this  question because &quot;Death&quot; may have the power to take a person's  life when his/her time is up, but I don't think &quot;Death&quot; can make  a dead person (the lawyer) come to life!

His acting skills are better than I expected. Of course Anthony Hopkins is fabulous as always in his role as wealthy business man William Parish.

The gist of the movie is that William Parish is dying but death's agent personified as Joe Black (Brad Pitt) wants to have a ""tour"" and chooses Mr. Parish as his ""guide"" because of the exemplary life he has lead, because of his ""verb"".

Wilson ""Atheen""","[1, 1]","One of my favorite stories is Death Takes a Holiday, of which I've seen at least two earlier versions over the past decades: one an old black and white film from the 30's occasionally seen on late night TV, and one a made for TV movie staring Monte Markham from the 70s.  Meet Joe Black is a more updated remake.I really didn't anticipate enjoying it as much as I did, since I've found most of the remakes produced recently rather a disappointment.  I had enjoyed the Monte Markham TV version, which is the first one I'd seen,  and I doubted that Brad Pitt, with whose characters I've not been much impressed in the past, would be able to carry off the role.  Anthony Hopkins, however, is one of my favorite actors, and I gambled that any movie that had him in the cast would prove to be worth the time even if the rest of the film were a bust.  I wasn't wrong.In fact, I was rather impressed with the overall production.  The character of the elderly rich man in the TV movie had been less three dimensional, but Hopkins gave him a depth that made the movie work.  His relationship with Death, Brad Pitt, was much more enlightening.  It gave the person of Death room for education and personal growth, which the original movie and the TV special had not done.  In the latter, Death simply appears as a finished character with a job, who sets aside his agenda to see how the ""other half"" lives.  Although you like him, Markham's Death doesn't develop as he comes to understand what it means to humans to ""be alive.""  He comes, he sees, he goes.The dynamics between Joe Black and the humans he meets is much more defining.  He begins as a grumpy, rude, arrogant creature with almost no social graces and no sense of humor, and gradually becomes a ""person.""  In fact he becomes the hero, helping others to realize their inner strength and to put the bad guy in his place.  He also has some delightful one liners that go right by most of the other characters but that amuse his mentor Hopkins no end.I did found the pacing of the film a little annoying, however.  The pauses, intended one supposes to be ""pregnant with meaning,"" were in fact just time consuming.  While the first one seemed purposeful, those succeeding it seemed contrived.  Sort of ""did you get the real meaning of this scene?""  Or perhaps, ""Film can be great art.  See how very artistic I can be?""  As it seems to have failed with audiences at the box office, one can't help but feel that it might have benefitted from a more ruthless editor!

He has come for Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), but makes a deal to give Parrish time in exchange for having a ""vacation"" in a human body with Parrish as his tour guide. Problem is, the body he chose for the purpose was one that had just made a big impression on Parrish's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani). Of course, Joe Black did not know anything about the body's activities before he took it: he just needed a body.Joe goes everywhere with Parrish, which causes no end of trouble. For one thing, never having had a body before, he didn't know basic things like peanut butter, or how to behave in a corporate boardroom. Because Parrish is very, very rich. He's the founder and Chairman of the Board of Parrish Communications, which is being faced with a takeover by a Rupert Murdoch sort of character. There are even a couple of spies on his board. One is a stupid dupe who doesn't understand the takeover aspect. The other is a stab-in-the-back glad hand who is the real mastermind of the swindle.Meanwhile Susan Parrish, a doctor resident in internal medicine, is falling in love with Joe Black, figuring he is the same guy she liked so much in the coffee shop that morning. There's a touching scene with a Jamaican grannie who begs him to take her away. She recognized him at once. He spoke Jamaican/Rasta dialect with her. She says she's in such pain, and he can help her.Joe turns out to be very clever at covering his identity when he's about to be found out.  He declares himself an IRS agent!

57569,ALR35EFI69S5R,078322706X,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[7, 7]","A film that faces the issue of death head-on does not sound like a very appetizing or appealing subject for Hollywood to bring the big budget approach to, yet in this wonderful remake of an older black and white classic, ""Death Takes A Holiday"" Director Martin Brest does exactly that, serving up both Sir Anthony Hopkins as the befuddled and yet self-important mortal suddenly confronted with the knowledge of his own imminent demise, and a winsome Brad Pitt as Death himself.  Of course, the lovely daughter that Hopkins has in tow attracts Pitt's character, and Death takes a little sojourn to get to know more about life in general and this family in particular.This is a thoughtful exploration of the fact of Death, its effect on us, and the way in which so many of us are in active denial of both its massive consequences and its finality.  Indeed, most of us live our own days as if we were immortal, building up estates and relationships as though to last forever. Yet for us, forever cannot be achieved, at least not on this particular mortal plain.  It is precisely in our denial, however, that we come closest to understanding what death really means, both for us in particular and for those meaningful others that surround us. It is this curious fact that the director spends his time so beautifully in exploring, albeit with some classic Hollywood twists and turns in the plot to show us that under the right set of circumstances, perhaps Death may be bargained with, after all.Both Hopkins and Pitt do a wonderful job here, as does the lovely young actress, Claire Forlani.  The sets are used to great effect, and the more than three-hour length of the movie transpires without one really noticing how much time has elapsed, a mark of an entertaining film.  This is a quite thoughtful film, and one that requires a lot of introspection and careful attention. It is not for the faint of heart, and I don't think it will be of particular appeal to younger viewers, who very often are active denial regarding their own mortality and are unlikely to appreciate the thoughtful discussion they would discover here. This is a great movie, and one I would heartily recommend for those filmgoers mature enough to appreciate it.

Claire Forlani in her evening gown at the end of the movie is one of the most powerful images of femininity I can recall - the way she looks, the way she moves, her control, lack of control, and the things she says, are all stunning to behold.But thats not where she's the most attractive.  Like several other reviewers, I first came across ""Meet Joe Black"" while I was changing channels on the TV.  When I saw Claire Forlani come into the coffee shop, in her ugly gray t-shirt, no hair styling, little makeup, I couldn't tear myself away.  This amazing vignette is for me, some of the most compelling footage I've ever seen.  Her every glance, movement, in/exhale seems to communicate emotions that build as the scene unfolds as she takes in and responds to this young man she's just met.  Lightning struck me too!  Wow.  (The only thing that seemed unnatural was when the two part company without either of them following up!)Watching Clair Forlani in this movie changed my image of beauty and femininity.

What a revelation the movie turned out to be!  Pitt's performance blew me away.  I wouldn't have given odds that he could hold his own against mega-talent Anthony Hopkins, but it was a match made in Heaven.  The basic story line is that Hopkins' character, a successful man who is the head of a powerful corporation as well as of a close-knit family, is having symptoms of an incipient heart attack.  Pitt, who plays ""Death"", takes the body of a young man, and decides to strike a deal...he will delay Hopkins' demise, and in exchange he will be a guest in Hopkins home and world.  Death wants to experience human life. Before Death makes an appearance, Pitt (as the young man whose body is later co-opted by Death) meets Hopkins' favorite daughter in a random way, over coffee, and both experience strong instant attraction.  When Pitt (no longer the very human young man but a remote and other-worldly essence who is using his body) shows up at her father's house during a family dinner, her confusion is tempered by the fact she still is attracted...but now wonders what happened to the likable guy she'd met earlier.Brad Pitt's dual portrayals; first of the charming and good-natured guy in the coffee shop, then contrasted with the very non-human consciousness of ""death"" masquerading as a human being is nothing short of astonishing.  This was the movie that convinced me Brad Pitt could really ACT.  He is utterly different as each character, although in both he is outwardly a very attractive young man in a business suit.  It's in his eyes that you see the shattering difference...and realize when you look into them that there is nothing human looking out, as ""Death"".  I remember being awestruck in the theatre, and thinking, ""Where did he PULL that from????""  How does one develop a character that is essentially inhuman, immortal and still frighteningly beautiful?  It was a masterful job of acting!Anthony Hopkins, as the man whose remaining life is under the control of Death, is brilliant, as always.  In his role as a father, a corporate leader, and then as a father fighting for the life of his daughter (Death has fallen in love with his daughter, and she with him; Hopkins must make Death develop human love and morality, in order to convince him not to ""take her with me"" when they depart for Death's true domain)...he uses all the talent and skills we expect of him.  His portrayal is achingly human and rises to our highest expectations.Along with a stunning supporting cast..each character fully developed and unerringly portrayed...I always thought this movie didn't get half the buzz it deserved.

This is a wonderful, deep, meditative, and amusing film, with more than a few improbable plot twists.Meet Joe Black has a lot in common with ""Heaven Can Wait"": Wealthy industrialist must meet his death, and love and a fortune hang in the balance, but does it with a more serious, sensitive and ponderous style.Anthony Hopkins is totally fascinating to watch. His powerful stride, his gestures, every deference to the routine, the duties, the responsibilities will draw you into Parrish's carefully sculptured world.As Parrish's daughter, Claire Forlani's fluttering, warm eyes carry more information and subtlety per second of screen time than those of nearly any other actor or actress. Wow! Those eyes are a major visual component of this movie! Forlani is fantastic!Thomas Newman's score is great, great, great. I can listen to it again and again.There is a place at the end where things fall apart a little bit. How does Susan Parrish intuit that Joe is not who she thought he was? Then she intuits that he is who she hoped he might be? That is the trickiest part of making this story work.Nevertheless, Mr. Brest and the screenwriter are to be congratulated for the unique style they bring to this film...quirky, rich with pregnant pauses, thoughtful.

Strnad ""Washed up jock""","[43, 44]","I didn't see this movie when it first came out in the theatres, and wasn't privvy to all the trash-talk about it's initial box-office flop. Came across it while channel-surfing about a year ago, and only caught bits and pieces of it the first few times- but was intrigued enough by what I saw to eventually buy my own copy; I have now watched it through several times in the last year. This being the 454th review of this film on this site, by no means do I figure to offer any amazing new insights for someone who has never seen this under-appreciated movie. But after reading through several of both the one and five-star reviews on this site, I thought I'd add just a few personal observations. To start, it is worth nothing that about 3/4 of the numerous reviews posted here rate MJB as a 5-star movie. The 5% that relegate it to one star all have a central theme: it was too long, too slow, and pretentious.Now I am a contemplative sort at heart, but still also enjoy a good pure-action flick, provided the production values, acting, plot and message are sound. Perhaps because I have been a cancer specialist for the past 23 years, and am witness to Death on a frequent basis (in His more obscure, spiritual form), I think those who are critical of the perceived ""slowness"" of this film just aren't catching what I believe must have been the intent of the director: life generally rushes by in the blink of an eye, but when you are confronted with your own imminent mortality, and the pressing reality of the prospect of Oblivion (or at least the end of all you know as real), everything tends to slow down to a snail's-pace. The last days, hours, minutes of one's life are grasped very dearly, and only relinquished with great resignation.The pace, therefore, of MJB I believe to be a purposeful attempt to capture that time warp- those who found this movie slow and pretentious just didn't buy into the attempt. I think many of the 5 star reviewers for this movie obviously did. I did, and can only add that when one's life is ""flashing before your eyes"", it actually ""flashes"" at a very languid pace. The human spirit holds on as long as it can, to savor what it is about to know no more.I won't comment on all the other aspects of this very-finely crafted movie, except to say that like so many others, I was riveted by Claire Forlani's physical presence: she didn't have to utter a single syllable in this film for me- Beauty beyond description, so much that even Death Himself was caught in her spell. How some reviewers saw Anthony Hopkins' performance in this film disappointing is beyond me: he's the perfect actor to handle the subdued and introspective nature of his character in MJB. Likewise, Brad Pitt does a credible job with a part that must have posed quite the challenge to portray in a believable way, and yet always manage to convey a sense of other-worldliness. The first time I watched MJB I was put-off by his seemingly stilted, robotic mannerisms and monotone speech- but with repeated viewing, it just fits. This guy (Death) doesn't get out much, after all. Also a nice casting choice to make the human form of Death so physically attractive: a subtle reminder that appearances are yet mortal, fleeting, dust in the wind.And the musical score is excellent- purposefully grandiose and sweeping at times, and lyrically subdued, tender, and sad at others. Of course, if you thought the movie slow and pretentious, the score probably also seems melodramatic. To each his own.But I guess to appreciate this movie you just ""have to be there"" : facing your own mortality with a guaranteed finality, and even an awareness of what will be your final day, your ""last rush of time"".If you are in such a place, or perhaps have faced it with a loved one, this movie will ring absolutely true.

57581,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,078322706X,C. Middleton,"[3, 3]","Meet Joe Black is a re-make of Death Takes a Holiday, a 1934 film directed by Mitchell Leisen. This classic differs from the re-make in many respects, however, Joe Black, despite its length, (three hours) maintains its own particular magic. Though many critics praised Sir Anthony's performance, Brad Pitt as Joe Black carried the film.Similar to the original screenplay, Maxwell Anderson and Gladys Lehman's adaptation of the Italian play by Alberto Casella, the central idea of the Death Angel taking a small vacation to then fall in love with a beautiful woman remains the same.It is rare that Sir Anthony Hopkins ever gives a bad performance. He was wonderful in this film but Brad Pitt, forever trying to shed his pretty boy image, does a great job as an angel inhabiting a recently dead person's body with such innocence and believability, that expression in the eyes and his awkward movements, carried the film. It was only after seeing this film that my opinion of Brad Pitt's skill as an actor was revealed. There is an ethereal quality to his performance, a particular look in the eye that suspends all disbelief that he is the Angel of Death.Clare Forlani as Susan Parish is absolutely stunning and her beauty actually grows as the story progresses. The love scenes were exceptional, her expressions heart felt and overall performance, to my mind, outstanding.As many have said before, Meet Joe Black is a celebration of life, a reflection on a life well worth lived and the opportunity to contemplate life before its exit. Although the cynical might label this film sentimental, considering the subject matter, in my opinion, it is appropriate though, interestingly, without a hint of irony.The interesting outcome or climax of the film had a slight twist and seemed perfect for a movie of this kind.This is a film that can be watched again as its nuances and subtlety can be discovered over many viewings.A well acted and well produced film.",4,A Long though Wonderful Film,1163894400,"11 19, 2006",2006,1954,"['Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 're-make', 'Death', 'Takes', 'Holiday', '1934', 'film', 'directed', 'Mitchell', 'Leisen', 'classic', 'differs', 're-make', 'many', 'respects', 'however', 'Joe', 'Black', 'length', 'three', 'hours', 'own', 'particular', 'magic', 'many', 'critics', 'praised', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'performance', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Joe', 'Black', 'carried', 'film.Similar', 'original', 'screenplay', 'Maxwell', 'Anderson', 'Gladys', 'Lehman', 'adaptation', 'Italian', 'play', 'Alberto', 'Casella', 'central', 'idea', 'Death', 'Angel', 'taking', 'small', 'vacation', 'then', 'fall', 'love', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'same.It', 'rare', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'ever', 'bad', 'performance', 'was', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'forever', 'trying', 'shed', 'pretty', 'boy', 'image', 'great', 'job', 'angel', 'inhabiting', 'recently', 'dead', 'person', 'body', 'such', 'innocence', 'believability', 'expression', 'eyes', 'awkward', 'movements', 'carried', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'seeing', 'film', 'opinion', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'skill', 'actor', 'was', 'revealed', 'ethereal', 'quality', 'performance', 'particular', 'look', 'eye', 'disbelief', 'Angel', 'Death.Clare', 'Forlani', 'Susan', 'Parish', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'actually', 'story', 'love', 'scenes', 'were', 'exceptional', 'expressions', 'heart', 'felt', 'overall', 'performance', 'mind', 'outstanding.As', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'celebration', 'life', 'reflection', 'life', 'well', 'worth', 'lived', 'opportunity', 'contemplate', 'life', 'exit', 'cynical', 'might', 'label', 'film', 'sentimental', 'considering', 'subject', 'matter', 'opinion', 'appropriate', 'interestingly', 'hint', 'irony.The', 'interesting', 'outcome', 'climax', 'film', 'had', 'slight', 'twist', 'seemed', 'perfect', 'movie', 'kind.This', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'again', 'nuances', 'subtlety', 'can', 'be', 'discovered', 'many', 'viewings.A', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'produced', 'film']",N/A

Claire Forlani is the woman that Joe falls in love with, although she is blind to who he really is, she loves him for who she thinks he is and why.Its a move celerbrating life and death, and the connecting line that seperates us from both, what is true love and the unselfish lengths it will go to if it is indeed true.Meet Joe Black is so much more than a film about Romance, instead, it is a beautifully told fable about what how one's mans desires can shape the future of those surrounding him.",5,His name is Joe......Joe black,1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,1065,"['Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'as', 'refreshing', 'drought', 'cold', 'water', 'beautiful', 'romance', 'getting', 'stale', 'leaving', 'watcher', 'unbemused.Brad', 'Pitt', 'man', 'body', 'taken', 'death', 'order', 'view', 'life', 'human', 'love', 'acceptence', 'instead', 'fear', 'dread', 'known', 'whole', 'life', 'love', 'reluctent', 'give', 'up', 'knows', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'fully', 'fulfilled.Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'man', 'who', 'death', 'picks', 'be', 'guide', 'more', 'uncaring', 'death', 'interested', 'more', 'time', 'gains', 'life', 'one', 'rapidly', 'shortening', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'woman', 'Joe', 'love', 'blind', 'who', 'really', 'who', 'move', 'celerbrating', 'life', 'death', 'connecting', 'line', 'what', 'true', 'love', 'unselfish', 'lengths', 'will', 'go', 'indeed', 'true.Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'Romance', 'instead', 'beautifully', 'told', 'fable', 'what', 'how', 'one', 'mans', 'desires', 'can', 'shape', 'future', 'surrounding']",N/A

I was surprised,  a moment ago, to find that this version had done poorly at the Box Office. Who Would Have Thunk It? By now, a description of the film and hundreds of viewer reviews are on the web page. No need to repeat. My view. With the performance of Anthony Hopkins as a firm foundation, the rest of the cast does quite well in creating an atmosphere appropriate to Love Conquers All in a World where Death Always Triumphs in the End. The actress (whom I have never seen) playing the Loved and Loving Role has one of those expressive faces (and body to go with it) that is suitably appealing, Brad Pitt is a solid suitor and Devil to boot and the family members express the diverse emotions of living with a powerful and not always benign father. The background music makes a considerable contribution to the production.All in all, I was surprised to find the film to be as long as it was. Time passes rapidly when one is captured by a film. I can commend it to all who think they would find a light and loving treatment of a fearful subject  entertaining. It helps that with DVD one can take a break for a drink or snack whenever one wants.

While I have to say that I enjoyed ""Meet Joe Black"", gaping plot holes (even for a fantasy) and a one-note performance by the  leading lady (Forlani?) really began to wear on me.I saw this movie  twice.  A two-hour version on an airplane, and recently the three-hour  video.  I must admit the two-hour version had a lot going for it and piqued  my interest for viewing the uncut version.  As it turns out, the two-hour  version was less painful.  It successfully delete all reference to the weak  sub-plot concerning the take-over attempt of Anthony Hopkin's business by  his prospective son-in-law.  Not only was this long, and sometimes tedious,  sub-plot unnecessary, it seemed typical Hollywood and didn't ring true  (basic idea being:  young man worms his way in a high-powered and very  successful business as number two man, gets engaged to beautiful daughter,  and all for the purpose of destroying the business, the man, and his own  fiancee?  As it turns out, the chairman's forced resignation only happened  because of Joe Black's strange presence and Hopkins obvious distracted  state of mind--which seems very contrived to me--cause and effect?).  Add  to that, I am now suppose to believe that this brilliant business giant  (Hopkins) doesn't even check with his private physician (which he must  have, being that rich) about his heart attacks?  Stretched my suspension of  disbelief.What ""Meet Joe Black"" had going for it was the fairly serious  tone of what is usually played as a `light' comedy-fantasy (although it did  have its cute and enduring moments).  Anthony Hopkins (as usual) was a  powerful force and I enjoyed almost all of the other performances,  including Brad Pitt's.  However, the leading lady's `puppy-dog' longing  (and long / silent) stares aimed at Joe Black, while charming at first,  made me cringe by the end of the movie.  And what is with the ending?  Don't you think it odd, after finally realizing the true situation, she  wouldn't walk (no, run) over the hill after her beloved father?  Nope.  Didn't happen.  Instead, she turns and walks off with Joe, amidst the  fireworks, leaving her obviously dead father to fertilize the grounds.  Gee  whiz, folks, happens every day;-)Between 1 and 10, I give ""Meet Joe  Black"" a solid 6.  Honestly, I truly liked this movie.

But ""Meet Joe Black"" suffered an even worse fate when it was released, because it never enjoyed the box office success that ""A.I."" did. In any event, ""Meet Joe Black"" is one gem of a movie, half fantasy and half drama, that has an important message about the lives we have, what we do with our time here on earth, and how we cope with loss and death. Although the movie is quite long (I think it could have been at least half an hour shorter and still have been just as effective), it never drags. Those who have written here that it is ""boring"" either can't allow themselves to feel some emotion, are too uncomfortable with the issue of death, or prefer to be spoon-fed the plot when watching a movie.

I just saw it again on DVD and now love it. Here are the reasons why:*For me, the main fascination of MJB is its underlying premise--what can happen when a noncorporal spirit being, the powerful Angel of Death, ""takes a holiday"" by assuming bodily form. It means that this spirit now experiences all the sensual pleasures and pains that flesh is heir to. He tastes food and develops a fondness for peanut butter; he sees and appreciates beauty in the form of Susan (Claire Forlani); he falls in love and is overcome by its ecstacies as well as its pains. He's also a quick learner in the lesson of being human, rapidly graduating in a few days to the pinnacle of what is best in humanity--our ability to transcend our selfishness for the good of another. In portraying this demanding role, I thought Brad Pitt did eminently well, especially in conveying with his eyes the immense power of the Angel of Death.*Anthony Hopkins' superb acting: He gives us such nuances of expression, imbuing his Bill Parrish with great feeling and believability. Wannabe actors should watch and learn from his performance, which was a master class in acting.*The movie's affirmation of life: At the end, watching the glorious fireworks and knowing that his death is imminent, Hopkins remarked to Joe Black that it's hard to tear oneself away (from life). If that doesn't move you, nothing will.*The movie's moral core: Unlike so many Hollywood flicks these days, MJB takes a moral and supernatural stance--that business can and should be ethical; that it's good that men would want to take care of the women they love; that love means responsibility, wanting what's good for the beloved, and self-sacrifice; and that those who have lived a morally good life have nothing to fear about death.",5,An intriguing Angel of Death,1183766400,"07 7, 2007",2007,1893,"['saw', 'Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'MJB', 'theater', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'thought', 'was', 'okay', 'nothing', 'great', 'just', 'saw', 'again', 'DVD', 'now', 'love', 'Here', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', '*For', 'main', 'fascination', 'MJB', 'underlying', 'premise', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'noncorporal', 'spirit', 'being', 'powerful', 'Angel', 'Death', 'holiday', 'assuming', 'bodily', 'form', 'spirit', 'now', 'sensual', 'pleasures', 'pains', 'flesh', 'heir', 'food', 'fondness', 'peanut', 'butter', 'beauty', 'form', 'Susan', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'love', 'overcome', 'ecstacies', 'as', 'well', 'pains', 'also', 'quick', 'learner', 'lesson', 'being', 'human', 'rapidly', 'graduating', 'few', 'days', 'pinnacle', 'what', 'best', 'humanity', 'ability', 'transcend', 'selfishness', 'good', 'portraying', 'demanding', 'role', 'thought', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'did', 'eminently', 'well', 'especially', 'conveying', 'eyes', 'immense', 'power', 'Angel', 'Death', '*Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'superb', 'acting', 'such', 'nuances', 'expression', 'imbuing', 'Bill', 'Parrish', 'great', 'feeling', 'believability', 'Wannabe', 'actors', 'should', 'watch', 'learn', 'performance', 'was', 'master', 'class', 'acting', '*The', 'movie', 'affirmation', 'life', 'end', 'watching', 'glorious', 'fireworks', 'knowing', 'death', 'imminent', 'Hopkins', 'remarked', 'Joe', 'Black', 'hard', 'tear', 'away', 'life', ""n't"", 'move', 'nothing', 'will', '*The', 'movie', 'moral', 'core', 'Unlike', 'so', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'flicks', 'days', 'MJB', 'moral', 'supernatural', 'stance', 'business', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'ethical', 'good', 'men', 'would', 'want', 'take', 'care', 'women', 'love', 'love', 'responsibility', 'wanting', 'what', 'good', 'beloved', 'self-sacrifice', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'morally', 'good', 'life', 'have', 'nothing', 'fear', 'death']",N/A

Death, it seems, is not a socialist. He admires and wishes to learn from a rich, successful capitalist rather than someone who has foresaken worldly goods in the service of the poor, for instance, or a prisoner of conscience in some gulag somewhere. The wine list is terrible in those places and anyway, death knows what 'The Stranglers' know, that is, it's only the children of the wealthy that tend to be good looking. Although they put it in more Anglo Saxon terms, if memory serves. The industrialist is played by Anthony Hopkins who obviously seems to view himself as an elder statesman to such an extent that he barely appears to be in the picture. He is smug and avuncular and you expect him to break out into a royal wave at any moment. Rather than lend a hand to some poor peasant whose about to have their land taken away from them by a tyrant, death lends a hand to a walking dollar sign in a less than scintilating boardroom battle that is supposed to have us laughing and cheering. Death is a bit repugnant, it seems.Slow and long, the director fancies this as his 'Being There', only you get Pitt instead of Sellars. Pitt is gorgeous but looking at that face for three hours is like gorging on a box of chockies. Too much of a good thing makes you want to throw. Death bends his own rules and let's a very good looking man go on living, presumably because blood on such a sharp suit may ruin any future job interview as a male model. We can't have that, can we? As the fireworks explode and the camera pulls back on a scene of outdoor opulance, we are reminded that it's a hard life for the privileged in letting go. No longer will they be able to watch films which make them feel good about being American. I mean, death loves America. He loves low cut dresses.

It doesn't ever come to fruition.Brad Pitt plays a wonderful young man who meets an untimely and grisley death in a hit and run accident.

57612,A18RBRV5S99XD8,078322706X,GRAHAM TOMLINSON,"[8, 10]","I am astonished at the number of reviews for this movie, it clearly made a  great impact on a lot of people, including me. Yes yes, I heard all the  negative reviews from critics last year, I know it bombed at the box  office, and romances are not top of my list as film choices go. I remained  open minded, however, as I have enjoyed the vast majority of BOTH leading  actors work. As it turned out, I will be honest and say I had trouble  getting into it...for the first ten minutes! Why? I felt Anthony Hopkins  was not totally convincing me, but after this initial uncertainty he  suddenly found his form and maintained it throughout the remainder of the  film. What a great film too. I was expecting to be entertained by Hopkins  and Brad Pitt, but this film just got better and better for many additional  reasons. The supporting cast were uniformly excellent, the story of Death  (Pitt) deciding to take human form on Earth, (to experience life, love, and  peanut butter), entertaining, and at times gently amusing, the love aspect  between him and Hopkins' daughter not at all sickly, (though I do wish Ms.  Forlani had tried to widen her range of facial expressions!), but best of  all some of the dialogue, which really drew me in and was quite emotionally  rewarding (and really hit home personally a couple of times), leading to a  final forty five minutes or so where I was totally bound up in the  situation, which was so cleverly resolved, when it had seemed impossible to  do so! To the lovers of this movie, (the majority of which I sincerely  doubt are silly teenagers who adore Brad Pitt and nothing else), I am glad  you gave it a chance to shine. To the critics, (reading some of the reviews  here was almost as entertaining as the movie...hmmm...maybe not!), I was  very disappointed in your lack of reasoning. There is no getting away from  the fact that Brad Pitt is an attractive man, why does this make people  jealous enough that they accuse his acting of being sub-standard? You all  go on about poor Mr. Hopkins being embroiled in a nonsense film way below  his talents, with Pitt the main protagonist in this offence, infact both  are excellent parts of a fulfilling whole. One reviewer did make a worthy  remark, that saying 'patience will be rewarded' is tantamount to saying  'survive the dross and you'll love the ending', where infact the whole film  must be rewarding to adulate it. However they chose the wrong film to  attach such a statement to, as clearly it is extremely rewarding  throughout. Finally as to length at three hours. I don't argue that the  film HAD to last that duration, what I do say is that it does not matter  that it did. It is rediculous to say the film was boring because it was so  long. If you didn't find the story compelling I doubt any amount of editing  would have lead you to enjoy it.  I do know that a majority of people find  a two hour film about all they can endure. Even a smash hit like  Independence Day, at forty minutes LESS than 'Meet Joe Black', was  considered overlong by a lot of my friends,(I felt it could have been a  little longer). If you love a film why do you want it to end? To the  reviewer who feels sorry for me and others for giving this film five stars,  when it is their opinion c**p, your two line critique indicates your lack  of genuine opinion, or maybe, as with the film, you just like to get things  over quickly!

I see the same opera over and over and over again, playing its recordings before and sometimes after I get home. I reread books, sometimes starting at the beginning directly after finishing.That aside, this film is  made as if the ancient myths of Greece, Rome, Egypt, and so forth, were to have made a comeback and allowed ""mortals"" to relate to IMMORTAL ENTITIES. the IMMORTAL ENTITY in this is DEATH. So all the technical questions of why DEATH behaves as he does, have no meaning, since in myth, one must suspend an expectation of reasonable reality. Actually one must do this in accepting a religious belief system.This is a very lush and luscious movie. All the surfaces, the sets, the paintings on the wall, the walls themselves, the vases filled with flowers, the artifacts of life itself are simply spectacular. I have watched it many times and now I look forward to seeing the uncut version with EVEN MORE! After seeing this film, many other films seem flat and without depth and content.

57628,AWA0CA9AYL5YQ,078322706X,Jennifer Litchfield,"[7, 26]","Meet Joe Black tries very hard to be a Significant Movie, but fails miserably.  It certainly has many of the constituent parts of a classic film including a three-hour running time, a respected senior actor teamed with Hollywood heartthrobs, and an orchestral score.  Unfortunately the music is also intrusive and overly sentimental, the film is at least an hour too long, and Claire Forlani irritatingly spends most of it in tears (although Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are adequate in their roles).Hopkins plays Bill Parrish, a media mogul squillionaire whom everybody loves.  We are expected to believe this without question, despite the fact that he is irritable, insensitive and patronisingly patriarchal towards his daughters.  The hands of fate have decreed that it is Bill's time to die, but over the millennia Death has become curious about the ways of people and offers Bill a bargain.  In return for a guided tour of the thing we know as life, Bill will be allowed to continue living for an unspecified length of time.  Of course Bill has a beautiful daughter (so Death can fall in love), a Machiavellian business partner (so Death can prove that he is really a good guy), and assorted family crises which provide the fodder for seemingly endless poignant glances.Perhaps the only thing that the film gets right is the sensual undressing sequence, with Pitt and Forlani proving that incredibly slow is also incredibly sexy.  That however, is the one bright point in a movie that waffles along towards its drawn out and saccharine conclusion.  And as far as conclusions go, it's pretty lame.

This film never loses touch or lapses.MEET JOE BLACK is a positively wonderful and uniquely engaging look  at life and death.Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is a self made millionaire facing his 65th birthday and a possible buy-out/merger of his company that he has literally poured himself into,even at the expense of spending quality time with his grown daughters (Marcia Gay Harden and Claire Forlani).Susan,played expertly by Forlani,is the youngest daughter,bright,semi-engaged to her father's right-hand man (Jake Weber of MEDIUM),and a Doctor in her own right.Both Bill and Susan have their lives literally turned upside-down and right-side-up when Death,disguised in the body of a  love interest that Susan has met (Brad Pitt),enters and assumes complete control,as The Reaper always has done,over present circumstances.You see,Death has taken a holiday from his daily grind of grimly reaping,and wants to learn a little about life now,at any cost.Brad Pitt is outstanding as Joe Black aka Death,(I have never been a Pitt fan,BUT this is a ""nailed"" role!), as he learns to inhabit the body of the man he has ""taken"" and experience and savour the ""pleasures of earthly life""...peanut butter,finding out that taxes are as sure as death,a touch,a smell...even sex!).Both Pitt and Hopkins are comedically in sync and the outcome is genuinely humourous as Joe Black seems intent on ""hanging on to life."" The chemistry between Death and Susan is lovely,tender and engrossing.The looks of the eyes,the tentative touches and uncertain moves are perfection.Forlani and Pitt sizzle and convince.

From the script to direction, performances of the key actors, musical score and production.  The DVD is Full screen with sharp vivid color and crisp clear sound.  The DVD is much better than the VHS format with respect to picture and sound quality without a doubt.  There is so much going on in this film and so much to take in that it's almost overwhelming.  It's a story about the joy and pain of life and it's a story about death.  However, in this film &quot;Death&quot; is not portrayed as the dark cloaked figure or celestial being you might expect.  Instead, the focus is cast on &quot;Death's&quot; lighter side, gentler side and venerable side when he takes human form.  This is a movie that must be viewed several times before one can truly appreciate the depth and magnitude of it.  It cannot be appreciated unless careful attention is given to the dialogue.  There are two scenes in the movie that call for special attention.  The scene in Bill Parrish's (Anthony Hopkins) office, following the &quot;Big Meeting with John Bonneque&quot; and the final scene with Joe Black (Brad Pitt) and Susan Parrish.  You may discover the dialogue in these scenes hold a key to a mystery. This is a movie you want to watch without interruption, and once you have ask yourself; When given the concept that &quot;Death's&quot; powers on his turf are somewhat boundless and that he obviously has some ongoing arrangement with, shall we say &quot;Father Time.&quot;  How inconceivable then, is the idea that &quot;Death&quot; may also possess the ability to turn back time?",5,A Different Take On &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot;,993081600,"06 21, 2001",2001,1731,"['quot', 'DEATH', 'quot', 'Sound', 'Ones', 'Own', 'Voice', 'Echoing', 'Back', 'From', 'Eternity', 'Everything', 'feature', 'film', 'quot', 'Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'quot', 'extraordinary', 'script', 'direction', 'performances', 'key', 'actors', 'musical', 'score', 'production', 'DVD', 'Full', 'screen', 'sharp', 'vivid', 'color', 'crisp', 'clear', 'sound', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'VHS', 'format', 'respect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'doubt', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'take', 'almost', 'overwhelming', 'story', 'joy', 'pain', 'life', 'story', 'death', 'However', 'film', 'quot', 'Death', 'quot', 'not', 'portrayed', 'dark', 'cloaked', 'figure', 'celestial', 'being', 'might', 'expect', 'Instead', 'focus', 'cast', 'quot', 'Death', 'quot', 'lighter', 'side', 'gentler', 'side', 'venerable', 'side', 'when', 'human', 'form', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'viewed', 'several', 'times', 'one', 'can', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'depth', 'magnitude', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'appreciated', 'careful', 'attention', 'given', 'dialogue', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'movie', 'call', 'special', 'attention', 'scene', 'Bill', 'Parrish', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'office', 'following', 'quot', 'Big', 'Meeting', 'John', 'Bonneque', 'quot', 'final', 'scene', 'Joe', 'Black', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Susan', 'Parrish', 'may', 'discover', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'hold', 'key', 'mystery', 'movie', 'want', 'watch', 'interruption', 'once', 'have', 'ask', 'When', 'given', 'concept', 'quot', 'Death', 'quot', 'powers', 'turf', 'are', 'somewhat', 'boundless', 'obviously', 'ongoing', 'arrangement', 'shall', 'say', 'quot', 'Father', 'Time.', 'quot', 'How', 'inconceivable', 'then', 'idea', 'quot', 'Death', 'quot', 'may', 'also', 'possess', 'ability', 'turn', 'back', 'time']",N/A

Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins both bring out the best in each other; Hopkins has a tendency to chew the scenery sometimes when the drama is high and Brad Pitt sometimes retreats behind his on-screen persona [sort of scruffy but charming, and a little vacant] if not challenged in his roles.  However, neither one of them do this in this film.  Hopkins shows great heart and humanity in a performance that is by turns subtle and stunning in its intensity.  Pitt underplays everything except the first scenes in the cafe.  This is Pitt as his most charming and engaging, which is saying a great deal.  The latter scenes, where Death takes over Pitt's character's body, are all the more amazing because they are so subdued.  Death, apparently, is very fond of peanut butter and [as one might expect] one glimpses an exceedingly dry, even arid, sense of humor.  Pitt's interpretation of Mr. D. rises to greatness because of the blend of both fulfilled expectations of what Death would be like personified and some surprising twists to the way he behaves.  The only point which seems to be a little out of character for Death is when he announces his love for Hopkins' daughter and his intent to take her with him when he goes.  I can see where it would be very hard for an actor to make this work, as we know that Death cannot love, for Death is the ultimate Detachment.  Love is about attaching one's life and soul to that of another.  The body that he occupies can experience heterosexual carnal desire, but Death can't really love someone.  The best he can hope for is a moment of the touching of the soul of the one that he loves, before he releases her to the Next Level. Pitt handles the part when he lets the girl know who he really is magnificently, but maybe what could have been done was to play the scene where he confesses his love as an expression of a profound wish that he *could* love someone so worthy of it.But who am I to give acting advice?

But it's the print-quality that will be the big draw here. With an aspect that fills the entire screen, the transfer is lush, detailed and a pleasure to look at practically all of the time. In short - ""Meet Joe Black"" is beautiful on Blu Ray...Mixing the supernatural with romance could have been awkward and even 'silly' in places (it sometimes is - Pitt speaking jive in the hospital to a black woman who knows he's the Grim Reaper is cringing), yet Brest has achieved an assured beauty throughout. This is a nice film in so many ways. And possibly because of its themes of loss and how we live our lives, it manages real warmth and a rare intelligence. The growing attraction between Claire Forlani (as Susan Parrish) and Brad Pitt (as Joe Black) is nicely set up in a caf&eacute; at the beginning of the film and then played out against preparations for her father's 65th birthday in his mansion throughout the film (Death has taken over his body and is being shown around by a reluctant Hopkins). Thomas Newman's lovely score also adds a classy feel to the film too and is used when it's needed.But it's the cast that make you watch - Claire Forlani is luminously beautiful as Daddy's 'too busy to be in love' daughter - she has eyes that could make most men literally lose their balance - while Anthony Hopkins as the corporate mogul William Parrish brings a sheer decency to the piece that gives it a beating heart (his dialogue above). The scene where he gets a heart attack in his office and the voice of death condescends and ridicules his advice to his daughter - is brilliant. You 'feel' his terror and disorientation. Throw in great supporting roles for Jake Weber as the dastardly boardroom schemer Drew, Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor as William's sister Allison and his bumbling but honest friend Quince - and it zips along very nicely indeed despite its 3-hour length. Pitt is hugely impressive too - handsome, sinister, controlled and funny too. He may be eye-candy to some, but there's real talent there - and often.Niggles - the USA HD-DVD has a 'Photo Montage' (still photographs of the cast and crew on location and on sets) and a lone extra called ""Spotlight On Location"" that features interviews with all the key people. It's barely 10-minutes long (and very lo-fi in terms of picture quality) but it's hugely entertaining. You can literally feel the awe and affection with which Anthony Hopkins is held by the entire cast - and short as it is, the featurette provides genuine insights into why and how the movie got made. Why a niggle - because it's 'not' on this 'UK' Blu Ray (licensing rights - laziness - who knows)? This UK version is also 'not' Region coded, so those in the USA and other parts of the World wanting to import it may have difficulty playing it on their players defaulted to wherever they live.

57657,A36EW68H08UOCS,078322706X,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[1, 4]","Death decides that he (she? it?) wants to experience life as a human being.  He also wants a good tour guide.  Death starts tracking William Parrish, an uber-wealthy, but apparently also uber good and moral and ethical businessman.  When Bill Parrish's heart starts moving towards the final heart attack, Death inhabits Brad Pitt's body and gives Mr. Parrish a deal - as long as Death is entertained by Mr. Parrish, Death won't take Mr. Parrish to the great beyond.Parrish is played by Anthony Hopkins, just a few years removed from ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""The Remains of the Day"".  This performance is critical to the movie, because you have to believe that with Kings and Queens and Captains of Science and Industry to choose from, Death would finally choose a guided tour from Bill Parrish than from, say, Gandhi or Bill Gates or Abraham Lincoln.Parrish has two daughters.  Marcia Gay Harden is Allison, the eldest daughter who is married to Jeffrey Tambor as Quince, an executive at Bill's company.  Allison is type A and is putting the finishing touches on Bill's sixty-fifth birthday party - the kind of party with hundreds of guests that include the President.  Quince is believable both as the kind of man who'd be married to Allison, as well as the kind of man who'd be on Bill's board of directors by merit rather than nepotism.The second daughter is Susan, an Internal Medicine resident played by Claire Forlani.  Susan is probably going to marry Drew, who is the Shark at Bill's company, and although Bill likes Drew at his company, he thinks that Susan should wait for lightning to strike rather than marry Drew because it seems a good match.Susan met the man owning the Brad Pitt body at a coffee shop soon after getting the ""lightning strike"" advice from her father, and in a lengthy, drawn out scene, you get the idea that both Susan and the Brad Pitt Coffee Shop guy think lightning may be striking.When Susan meets Death later on she is taken aback, not because she knows she is speaking to Death, but because the man with the Brad Pitt looks seems different from the man at the coffee shop.After Death tells Bill the ""rules"" of their arrangement Bill realizes he can't just walk around and say ""hello... I'd like you to meet my new friend, Death..."" and improvises the name ""Joe Black"".Many stories depend on the transformation of their characters, and sometimes one transformation is enough for a good story.  In some ways ""Meet Joe Black"" is a little too ambitious because it tries to show Death's introduction to the human experience, complete with kissing and peanut butter, Bill's transformation toward the end of his life, Susan's acceptance of the need for ""lightning"", Allison's realization that she's not her father's favorite and Bill's Board of Directors learning that some business deals shouldn't happen.Most of the films that run three hours earn that right.  Theater turnovers and audience attention spans have made a two hour standard something that is rarely exceeded.  Meet Joe Black clocks in at 2:58.  The film has many awkward pauses - often in the character's dialogue - that don't advance the plot.  A well timed and infrequent pause can heighten the dramatic tension.  Too many and poorly timed pauses can make a 2:20 movie 2:58.Still - the Mrs. and I enjoyed it.",4,Interesting - Occasionally brilliant - Could have used some judicious editing,1240185600,"04 20, 2009",2009,3310,"['Death', 'experience', 'life', 'human', 'being', 'also', 'good', 'tour', 'guide', 'Death', 'tracking', 'William', 'Parrish', 'uber-wealthy', 'apparently', 'also', 'uber', 'good', 'moral', 'ethical', 'businessman', 'When', 'Bill', 'Parrish', 'heart', 'moving', 'final', 'heart', 'attack', 'Death', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'body', 'Mr.', 'Parrish', 'deal', 'as', 'long', 'Death', 'entertained', 'Mr.', 'Parrish', 'Death', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'Mr.', 'Parrish', 'great', 'beyond.Parrish', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'removed', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Remains', 'Day', 'performance', 'critical', 'movie', 'have', 'believe', 'Kings', 'Queens', 'Captains', 'Science', 'Industry', 'choose', 'Death', 'would', 'finally', 'choose', 'guided', 'tour', 'Bill', 'Parrish', 'say', 'Gandhi', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln.Parrish', 'two', 'daughters', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Allison', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'who', 'married', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'Quince', 'executive', 'Bill', 'company', 'Allison', 'type', 'putting', 'finishing', 'touches', 'Bill', 'sixty-fifth', 'birthday', 'party', 'kind', 'party', 'hundreds', 'guests', 'include', 'President', 'Quince', 'believable', 'kind', 'man', 'who', ""'d"", 'be', 'married', 'Allison', 'as', 'well', 'kind', 'man', 'who', ""'d"", 'be', 'Bill', 'board', 'directors', 'merit', 'rather', 'nepotism.The', 'second', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'Internal', 'Medicine', 'resident', 'played', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'Susan', 'probably', 'going', 'marry', 'Drew', 'who', 'Shark', 'Bill', 'company', 'Bill', 'Drew', 'company', 'Susan', 'should', 'wait', 'lightning', 'strike', 'rather', 'marry', 'Drew', 'good', 'match.Susan', 'met', 'man', 'owning', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'body', 'coffee', 'shop', 'soon', 'getting', 'lightning', 'strike', 'advice', 'father', 'lengthy', 'drawn', 'out', 'scene', 'get', 'idea', 'Susan', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Coffee', 'Shop', 'guy', 'think', 'lightning', 'may', 'be', 'striking.When', 'Susan', 'meets', 'Death', 'later', 'taken', 'aback', 'not', 'speaking', 'Death', 'man', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'different', 'man', 'coffee', 'shop.After', 'Death', 'tells', 'Bill', 'rules', 'arrangement', 'Bill', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'walk', 'say', 'hello', ""'d"", 'like', 'meet', 'new', 'friend', 'Death', 'name', 'Joe', 'Black', '.Many', 'stories', 'depend', 'transformation', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'one', 'transformation', 'enough', 'good', 'story', 'ways', 'Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'little', 'too', 'ambitious', 'show', 'Death', 'introduction', 'human', 'experience', 'complete', 'kissing', 'peanut', 'butter', 'Bill', 'transformation', 'end', 'life', 'Susan', 'acceptance', 'need', 'lightning', 'Allison', 'realization', 'not', 'father', 'favorite', 'Bill', 'Board', 'Directors', 'learning', 'business', 'deals', 'should', ""n't"", 'happen.Most', 'films', 'run', 'three', 'hours', 'earn', 'right', 'Theater', 'turnovers', 'audience', 'attention', 'spans', 'have', 'made', 'two', 'hour', 'standard', 'something', 'rarely', 'exceeded', 'Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'clocks', '2:58', 'film', 'many', 'awkward', 'often', 'character', 'dialogue', 'do', ""n't"", 'advance', 'plot', 'well', 'timed', 'infrequent', 'pause', 'can', 'heighten', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'Too', 'many', 'poorly', 'timed', 'pauses', 'can', 'make', '2:20', 'movie', '2:58.Still', 'Mrs.', 'enjoyed']",N/A

At nearly three hours and with only one small action sequence, it's way beyond the patience level of some folks. In hindsight, it does seem strange that the nearly one hundred million dollar project would be approved in the first place, but I, for one, am happy that this corporate accident occurred. I like to savor things, so Meet Joe Black's unusual length was not a problem. Ironically, its a remake of a 1930s movie called Death Takes a Holiday, which runs less than ninety minutes.The plot revolves around billionaire William Parrish's unexpected encounter with Death. He is literally visited by The Grim Reaper, who has taken fleshly form, apparently because he wants to know what it feels like to be alive. Yet, though the subject matter is mainly about mortality, this is the most life-affirming Hollywood movie in ages.Death takes the form of a mysterious young man named Joe Black. One of the great casting coups in recent times was to cast Brad Pitt as Joe. The impossibly good-looking Mr. Pitt causes everyone's worst fear to become something serene and angelic - the exact opposite of what we imagine. It is then possible to see Death as a spirit that's just doing its job, rather than as some totally malignant force.Anthony Hopkins is wonderful, as always, as Bill Parrish. Again, the casting throws us a curve. He makes us believe that someone can climb to the top of the heap and still remain caring and loving and passionate. Who else but Hopkins could conjure up a lovable billionaire?Pitt and Hopkins play incredibly well together. Hopkins is renowned for bringing the best out in his coworkers, but in this case, I think Pitt is proving that, given material within his range, which is limited by his looks, he can be formidable. Hopkins can roar like a lion, while Pitt is more like a cobra, making his point with just a hiss.I said this was a romantic drama. Love comes in the form of Parrish's daughter, Dr. Susan Parrish. Joe and Susan become more than a bit attracted to each other Naturally, she has no idea he's not so human. Claire Forlani plays Susan, and she is a delight. She's a 90s woman to the core, and she hasn't much use for romance until Joe Black. Their love scenes are quite believable. She reminds me a bit of Gwenyth Paltrow, albeit not quite as beautiful. I expect to see much more of her.Marcia Gay Hardin sparkles as Allison, the older sister. Jeff Tamber is touching as her not so bright husband. And Jake Weber is over the top as Drew, the true villain of the movie.The photography is glorious, as is the music. This is a film mainly for older audiences. I can see why Hollywood's audience of choice - teenagers - was underwhelmed by it. It speaks of things that are not yet of interest to most of them.",5,On my Top Ten List of 1998,1016841600,"03 23, 2002",2002,2883,"['What', 'probably', 'caused', 'film', 'tank', 'boxoffice', 'thus', 'get', 'several', 'top', 'execs', 'Universal', 'fired', 'running', 'time', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'only', 'one', 'small', 'action', 'sequence', 'way', 'patience', 'level', 'folks', 'hindsight', 'seem', 'strange', 'nearly', 'one', 'hundred', 'million', 'dollar', 'project', 'would', 'be', 'approved', 'first', 'place', 'one', 'am', 'happy', 'corporate', 'accident', 'occurred', 'like', 'savor', 'things', 'so', 'Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'unusual', 'length', 'was', 'not', 'problem', 'Ironically', 'remake', '1930s', 'movie', 'called', 'Death', 'Takes', 'Holiday', 'less', 'ninety', 'minutes.The', 'plot', 'billionaire', 'William', 'Parrish', 'unexpected', 'encounter', 'Death', 'literally', 'visited', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'who', 'taken', 'fleshly', 'form', 'apparently', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'alive', 'subject', 'matter', 'mainly', 'mortality', 'most', 'life-affirming', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'ages.Death', 'form', 'mysterious', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Joe', 'Black', 'One', 'great', 'casting', 'coups', 'recent', 'times', 'was', 'cast', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Joe', 'impossibly', 'good-looking', 'Mr.', 'Pitt', 'everyone', 'worst', 'fear', 'become', 'something', 'serene', 'angelic', 'exact', 'opposite', 'what', 'imagine', 'then', 'possible', 'see', 'Death', 'spirit', 'just', 'doing', 'job', 'rather', 'totally', 'malignant', 'force.Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'wonderful', 'always', 'Bill', 'Parrish', 'Again', 'casting', 'curve', 'believe', 'someone', 'can', 'climb', 'top', 'heap', 'still', 'remain', 'caring', 'loving', 'passionate', 'Who', 'else', 'Hopkins', 'could', 'conjure', 'up', 'lovable', 'billionaire', 'Pitt', 'Hopkins', 'play', 'incredibly', 'well', 'together', 'Hopkins', 'renowned', 'bringing', 'best', 'out', 'coworkers', 'case', 'think', 'Pitt', 'proving', 'given', 'material', 'range', 'limited', 'looks', 'can', 'be', 'formidable', 'Hopkins', 'can', 'roar', 'lion', 'Pitt', 'more', 'cobra', 'making', 'point', 'just', 'hiss.I', 'said', 'was', 'romantic', 'drama', 'Love', 'form', 'Parrish', 'daughter', 'Dr.', 'Susan', 'Parrish', 'Joe', 'Susan', 'become', 'more', 'bit', 'attracted', 'other', 'Naturally', 'idea', 'not', 'so', 'human', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'Susan', 'delight', '90s', 'woman', 'core', ""n't"", 'much', 'use', 'romance', 'Joe', 'Black', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'believable', 'bit', 'Gwenyth', 'Paltrow', 'not', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'expect', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'her.Marcia', 'Gay', 'Hardin', 'Allison', 'older', 'sister', 'Jeff', 'Tamber', 'touching', 'not', 'so', 'bright', 'husband', 'Jake', 'Weber', 'top', 'Drew', 'true', 'villain', 'movie.The', 'photography', 'glorious', 'music', 'film', 'mainly', 'older', 'audiences', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'audience', 'choice', 'teenagers', 'was', 'underwhelmed', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'interest', 'most']",N/A

At first it promises to be a spectral thriller, but quickly counters as a dramatic romance.  It is a poignant look at what a life well lived is, and should remind us all to live with no regrets.  Starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, and Claire Forlani, Meet Joe Black is a must see movie, even if you don't keep it in your DVD collection.I do not have the life Bill (Anthony Hopkins) portrays.  However, he lives Everyman's dream.  We all want to be surrounded by those we love.  We crave power.  We desire fortune and comfort and struggle to attain it at every venture.  Hopkins however gives a wisdom to the role of this dream.  Bill is the benefactor we all need, the father most of us wish to be and the oracle for a life well lived.  Bill is confronted by death.Death is selfish, smooth, and at times very cruel.  Heartless and cold, Death's one desire is to ""live"" like Hopkins' character does.  Joe (Brad Pitt) is gallant, charming, and perfectly suited to the role.  When we first meet him, Joe is an ordinary man with extraordinary dreams.  He soon however becomes Death's puppet, and is inhabited by the entity of the dark spectre.  As Death, he disrupts everything he can about the harmony surrounding Bill's life.  He even steals Susan's heart.  Bill cannot stand the thought of his daughter loving Death.Susan (Claire Forlani) is beautiful, smart, and dreamy.  She aspires to be her father's daughter and shuffles after his number one assistant in a loveless pursuit of marriage.  Bill sees this and warns his daughter to settle for nothing less than ""floating, dancing a dervish, swept away by desire and passion, with a little time to remember me.""  Soon after he render's this advice, lightening strikes and Susan meets Joe.  Joe echoes Bill's words sending Susan into a dizzying head over heels infatuation with him, just before Death takes his body.In the end, the three primaries create a paradoxical balance which leads to an inevitable ending, which can only be described as magical.  Though I love Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt, I will always adore Claire Forlani's performance.  She is at the center of impossible circumstances and inspires every girl to dream of that one love which surprises you.  Hopkins completely compliments her as a devoted father. Just about any young handsome leading man could have played Brad Pitt's role, but it was done well enough by Pitt.

Unfortunately, it is also his time to die as well, because Death ( Brad Pitt) decides to pay Bill a visit. Bill manages to make a deal with Death to keep him alive a little bit longer, in exchange for teaching him what it is like to be human. Things become complicated however, when Death not only takes up an interest in life, but in Bill's beautiful daughter Susan ( Claire Forlani) as well.For some reason &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; has received mixed reviews from critics and moviegoers. In my opinion, this remake of the 1934 film &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot; was one of the best films I have seen in quite some time. The movie has gained a reputation for being long and drawn out because it is 3 hours long. I did not find the film to be drawn out at all, and time flew by for me when watching this film. Brad Pitt is actually a very good actor and shows it in this film. Pitt accurately portrayed how Death would react to the world around him with his endless curiousity and naive behavior. The scene where Death discovers peanut butter for the first time is priceless!! Anthony Hopkins was great as usual, and turns in another oscar worthy performance as Bill Parrish. You come to legitimately feel for his character because you know that it is only a matter of time before the inevitable is coming. The thing that impressed me most about the film, was that the romantic story between Death and Claire Forlani's character Susan is extremely well done, despite the gloom setting that Death's presence brings. I also highly recommend picking up the soundtrack to this film. The musical score used was outstanding.The only piece of advice I can give with this film, is to ignore its reputation and give it a shot.

Like settling in with a good long book, this movie wraps around you as it explores thought-provoking ideas. Besides, what's wrong with long movies? I've read a number of reviews disparaging this film's length. ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Ben Hur"" are long, too, but both are well worth their three hours length. (Maybe what hurt this movie at the box office was its title, which, in my view, is nondescript.)Nevertheless, in ""Joe Black,"" I was fascinated by the premise of Death wanting to try out a corporeal existence. And what a great person to check it out with--the wealthy and successful Bill Parrish (Hopkins). He's smart, influential, upstanding, and, wow! He has some beautiful homes to just drool over and vicariously enjoy. (The indoor penthouse pool overlooking Manhattan! I want it!)Yes, the plot may be contrived, but the acting is stunning. I was pleasantly surprised by Brad Pitt. Certainly, he first captivated the world as the cocky young outlaw in ""Thelma and Louise,"" but in this film he shows he has some acting chops. Especially in the gorgeous sex scene where Death has his first taste of carnal knowledge. Pitt's expression of astonished ecstacy is exquisite. One quibble I have with his performance is the Jamaican accent he affects when encoutering a dying Jamaican woman. Why wasn't Joe Black's quiet, studied voice adequate for these scenes?Anyway, Claire Forlani, as the love interest, is wonderful, too. And where is she now? We should see more of this beautiful actress in American cinema.As for Anthony Hopkins, I would watch any of his films just because he's in them: if he's in it, it must be good.

57683,A3VSUJZC7D352O,078322706X,Nate,"[1, 2]","First of all I would like to get the negative points of the movie out of the way. For starters, it is way too long. I think it is completely un-necessary for a movie to go longer than two hours, and at 173 minutes, meet joe black plays out way too long. Some scenes seem to drag out forever and could have quite easily been edited down even more. Second of all, the sound quality on the DVD is poor. The music score is recorded too loud while the dialogue is too soft. I found myself continuously adjusting the volume to hear the dialogue in some parts and to turn down the music in others.On a positive note, I found Meet Joe Black to be a very entertaining movie nonetheless. Well scripted and featuring excellent performances by Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani, it is a sad movie while delivering a positive message at the same time.Brad Pitt faces his toughest role to date as the Grim Reaper, or Death. Spending a few days on Earth, he is shown the world through the body of an ordinary person by his tour guide Bill Parish, played by Anthony Hopkins. Parrish agrees to be his tour guide in exchange to spend a bit more time on earth to be able to close up a few loose ends of his business as well as to properly say goodbye to his loving daughters.Along the way, both Pitt and Hopkins learn many valuable lessons about love, honesty, betrayel and strength of character. The two actors play their parts perfectly and Forlani also is a shining light as Hopkins daughter and Pitt's love interest. The film builds to a dramatic yet predictable conclusion, but yet is still an emotional ending.Not a great deal to speak of in the special feautures, but you get a trailer, cast bio, production notes and an on the set documentary.A feel good movie with a positive message, a good movie to add to the collection.",4,Meet Death,1166400000,"12 18, 2006",2006,1825,"['First', 'would', 'like', 'get', 'negative', 'points', 'movie', 'way', 'starters', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'think', 'completely', 'un-necessary', 'movie', 'go', 'longer', 'two', 'hours', '173', 'minutes', 'meet', 'joe', 'black', 'plays', 'out', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'scenes', 'seem', 'drag', 'out', 'forever', 'could', 'have', 'quite', 'easily', 'been', 'edited', 'down', 'even', 'more', 'Second', 'sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'poor', 'music', 'score', 'recorded', 'too', 'loud', 'dialogue', 'too', 'soft', 'found', 'continuously', 'adjusting', 'volume', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'parts', 'turn', 'down', 'music', 'others.On', 'positive', 'note', 'found', 'Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'Well', 'scripted', 'featuring', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'sad', 'movie', 'delivering', 'positive', 'message', 'same', 'time.Brad', 'Pitt', 'toughest', 'role', 'date', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'Death', 'Spending', 'few', 'days', 'Earth', 'shown', 'world', 'body', 'ordinary', 'person', 'tour', 'guide', 'Bill', 'Parish', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Parrish', 'agrees', 'be', 'tour', 'guide', 'exchange', 'spend', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'earth', 'be', 'able', 'close', 'up', 'few', 'loose', 'ends', 'business', 'as', 'well', 'properly', 'say', 'goodbye', 'loving', 'way', 'Pitt', 'Hopkins', 'learn', 'many', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'love', 'honesty', 'betrayel', 'strength', 'character', 'two', 'actors', 'play', 'parts', 'perfectly', 'Forlani', 'also', 'shining', 'light', 'Hopkins', 'daughter', 'Pitt', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'dramatic', 'yet', 'predictable', 'conclusion', 'yet', 'still', 'emotional', 'ending.Not', 'great', 'deal', 'speak', 'special', 'feautures', 'get', 'trailer', 'cast', 'bio', 'production', 'notes', 'set', 'documentary.A', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'positive', 'message', 'good', 'movie', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

57686,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,078322706X,Nix Pix,"[2, 2]","""Meet Joe Black"" is a film of contradictions.  After starting out with a genuinely thought-provoking premise (what would happen if death took a human form and came to earth to learn about life from his next victim) the plot comes to a grinding halt when Death - in the embodiment of Brad Pitt - falls for his victim's daughter.  Anthony Hopkins is Bill Perish, Death's next intended victim and, as usual, gives us a performance of quiet, poignant introspection that is masterfully crafted and beautiful to behold.After some laborious inner conflict and some totally extemporanious scenes that have nothing to do with the central plot, ""Meet Joe Black"" concludes with a knock out birthday celebration sequence that has such an emotional swell built into it, I found myself getting weepy before the final fade out.This is the ""Ultimate Edition"" of a DVD already made available, which really translates to the fact that all Universal Studios has done is to slap the same transfer into some snazzy new packaging while adding some real throw away extras on a second disc that one could easily live without if one already owns the first DVD incarnation.Image quality on this DVD is the same as the previously released DVD.  At times the picture is quite solid, with excellent color fidelity, shadow and contrast delineation and solid black levels.  Unfortunately, quite often the picture gets bogged down with pixelization that really breaks apart background detail.  There's also some minor edge enhancement and some slight shimmering of background and fine detail.  Contrast levels can, in a few instances, be too low.  The audio is 5.1 and well balanced, with explosive bass levels that will really give your rear speakers a work out.The big, big, BIG extra that Universal throws us on disc two is ""Death Takes A Holiday"" a Paramount flick with Frederick March playing Death, come down to earth to study mankind before claiming one for his own.  It's a dated movie with overly theatrical performances and a generally middle-of-the-road budget that really makes the whole thing pretty tacky.  As for the quality of the transfer, the gray scale is adequately balanced but with chips and scratches on the original negative.  Contrast levels are often too low.  The audio is mono and strident.BOTTOM LINE: If you don't already own this movie, I'd recommend it.  Just keep in mind that it's a two hour premise stretched to a three hour running time.

57687,AYU9LBROYQBG6,078322706X,"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat...","[4, 4]","The film includes three main story lines: a nave Angel of Death (Brad Pitt) first experiences with simple pleasures such as peanut butter, his chosen guide's attempts to keep his business based on the principles on which he founded it, while coming to terms with his own mortality, and a romance between ""Joe Black"" and his guide's daughter, Susan (Claire Forlani). It includes a large quantity of profane language and several emotional themes.The movie opens with an introduction to the guide, Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), who doubts that he will live for many more years. Indeed, he is approached in his home and work by what he thinks are hallucinations, wherein Death himself has come with the intention of escorting him to the afterlife.Bill, touched by his dream-like brush with mortality, expresses his desire for his daughter, Susan, to live a life with passion. She is considering marriage, but her father is not favorably impressed by her relationship. When she asks for the short version of his impassioned speech, he simply says, ""Stay open. Who knows? Lightning could strike!"".Shortly after hearing this advice, Susan meets a vibrant young man of whom she is instantly enamored. Immediately after this encounter, the man dies of collision with two cars. Death returns to Bill's home in the form of the young man, explaining that his impassioned speech has piqued his (Death's) interest after an eternity of boredom. Given Bill's ""competence, experience, and wisdom"", Death has chosen him and tells Bill that in return for an extended lifetime, Bill shall be his guide on Earth. Notably, during his time on Earth, Death's personality alters to become mildly curious, ruminative, and gentle, having been worldly, sardonic, and arrogant until he reveals his appearance.Death then places himself at Bill's right hand, under the name 'Joe Black', and establishes his place in Bill's home and work, instructing Bill to reveal his identity to nobody. This last task is complicated when the Board of Directors of Bill's corporation are urging a union with a larger company at the instigation of Susan's fianc&eacute;e, Drew (Jake Weber). After a tense Board meeting wherein Bill advises the Board against the merger, Joe ventures into the city to explore it. He visits the hospital where Susan works as a doctor to see her and in doing so, observes the human aspect of mortality, which was apparently unknown to him. A dying Guyanese patient recognizes him as a spirit; upon learning that he is Death, she asks to be taken to the afterlife. Joe instead soothes her pain and promises to take her later.He returns to visit Bill, who describes his late wife, to whom he was strongly attached. Their conversation is interrupted by Drew, who is bothered by the reversal of Bill's decision regarding the merger. Bill becomes angry at the prospect of the company that he built becoming less than he planned, believing that a man should leave something of integrity in his passing, whereupon Joe cautions ""Easy, Bill; You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation"".Realizing that Joe could end his delay at any time, Bill unprecedentedly arranges for dinner with his family two nights in a row, prompting them to be afraid. Bill attempts a broken and awkward speech focusing on the idea of family, after which he invites them all back for dinner again the next night. Touched by his feelings, they all agree, with one exception; that being Drew, who is angered by the presence of Joe Black, who appears to have taken the ear of Bill Parrish and disrupted Drew's plans. He is even more rankled by the increasing closeness between Susan and Joe. After a number of snide comments aimed at Joe over dinner, Drew confronts Susan about her feelings for Joe, which ends in Drew's uncertainty.After a flirtatious conversation with Joe, who has overheard the argument with Drew, Susan is warned by Bill not to become attached to this mysterious stranger. During the next day, Drew has gathered the board of the company, advising them that Parrish has been unconditionally influenced by ""Mr. Joe Black"" and telling them that the offer from the rival company will be accepted with or without Parrish as Chairman.After a scene wherein Parrish is reminded of the importance to himself of his family when he distresses his other daughter, Allison (Marcia Gay Harden), who is trying to organize Bill's sixty-fifth birthday party, he answers the door to Drew, who starkly threatens that the Board will see him removed from the Chair. Drew then leaves, angrily announcing to Susan that this is ""the end of my chapter with the Parrishes. And the end began with this guy"", indicating Joe, who has also followed. After a tense and crude standoff, Drew leaves Susan and Joe alone. They are interrupted by Bill, who shows concern for his daughter.The following morning, Parrish is confronted by Drew and the Board of Directors, who reiterate their intentions regarding the merger. After Bill's emphatic refusal to accept both the merger and the Board's request for the identity of Joe, they vote to make Bill ""Chairman Emeritus"", thus depriving him of power. After the meeting, it is revealed that Drew was in collaboration with the rival company with the intention of seizing power and then selling off Parrish Communications for a huge profit.Bill and Joe return home, where Bill, disheartened, goes for a nap. Joe comes across Susan; after an awkward moment, they make love. Afterwards, he meets with Bill, who defies this union and reminds Joe of his purpose in the universe. Joe disregards Bill's words.Shortly after another encounter with Bill's daughter, Joe realizes that she is not enamored exactly of him, but rather of the man whose body he has assumed. Joe returns to Bill, who tries to entrap Drew. Joe assists by claiming that he is an IRS agent investigating Drew's dealings; a play on the saying ""death and taxes"". Bill is restored as chairman and the merger is canceled.In his speech at the lavish gala celebration, Bill Parrish fondly expresses his appreciation to his daughters for their work preparing it as well as his love for both of them. Joe later escorts Bill out of sight over a nearby bridge, presumably to his own death. Joe then sends back to life the young man whose body he borrowed, allowing Susan that chance to pursue a relationship with him. Susan tells him she wishes he could have met her father, indicating that she understands (as hinted earlier) that Joe Black was Death, and that her father is dead. The story ends as both of them are watching the fireworks celebrating her father's birthday.Although the film's story and characters were praised highly, many critics felt that its three hour running time was excessive, and thus reaction became mixed, with one half of the critical spectrum branding it boring, and the other half claiming that its slow pace made the story more poignant.[1] The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films nominated it for a Saturn Award in three categories - Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best Music - the film was also nominated in the Worst Remake or Sequel category at the Razzie Awards. Gary Richied of the Westchester Gazette gave the movie a 4 star rating, citing the Academy Award deserving performances by Pitt and Hopkins. It also received positive reviews from Siskel and Ebert, who gave it ""Two Thumbs Up"", with Ebert adding ""there's so much that's fine in this movie"".[2]While the film had a disappointing domestic box office return of $44,619,100, it fared much better overseas. Taking in an additional $98,321,000, the movie grossed a worldwide total of $142,940,100.A two-hour version was made to show on television and airline flights, by cutting most of the plotline involving Hopkins' character's business. Brest derided this edit of his film and thus disowned it, so the director's credit was changed to the Hollywood pseudonym Alan Smithee.",5,"ONE OF THE GREAT CHICK FLICKS, LONG AND

First, the pluses. Brad Pitt, a fine actor as well as a heck of an eyeful, gives a nuanced, rather endearing performance--first as an outgoing young hunk in a coffee shop, then as Death, who inhabits the body of said hunk in order to experience the world first-hand. &quot;Joe Black&quot; is a character who seems to know almost everything about everybody, yet he has no experience whatsoever of the basic five senses, or exactly how to behave in a social setting. (He's like a cross between a benevolent Big Brother and Kaspar Hauser.) Hence his amazement at the pleasures of peanut butter, swivel chairs, and lovemaking. Anthony Hopkins refrains from dining on the scenery and offers a balanced interpretation of a wealthy news magnate on the brink of death. The attractive Claire Forlani is good, if a bit twitchy, as Death's love interest, Jeffrey Tambor is moving as Hopkins' bumbling son-in-law, and the versatile Marcia Gay Harden is excellent as Hopkins' earnest and caring older daughter. On the minus side--if only Mr. Brest had tightened up the ending, and cut all the padding (yes, Mr. Pitt is gorgeous, but the closeups don't have to last ten minutes) and excess chatter--this could have been a wonderful film.

Claire Forlani couldn't have been better cast for her part as Susan (Bill's daughter); a doctor in the hospital in which Joe makes an unscheduled visit. There's also a very touching scene between Bill (speaking of his late wife) and Joe, over a cold lamb sandwich.Jeffrey Tambor as Quince, and Marcia Gay Harden as Allison (""throwing the Birthday Party of the Century"" - for her Dad, Bill) lend great support to this story of a man's soon-to-be demise from the world. And Jake Weber as Drew, the long-suffering boyfriend of Susan (and also the back-stabbing business partner of Bill), who really takes a mental pounding from Joe; which at times is hilarious. The second dinner scene with a slight confrontation between Drew and Joe may leave you in stitches.Thought-provoking lessons in living one's life to the fullest, by not taking for granted the little things we ignore while trying to go about ""making a living"" instead of ""living life.""

57704,A1H28XNY23QZEX,078322706X,"R. L. Pulliam ""no lemming, I""","[4, 4]","As wonderful as this film is on standard DVD, it was worth my plunge into HD-DVD to see this magnificent film in high definition. It's totally extraordinary.The exquisite production design has added depth and richness I would never have imagined. The camerawork is masterful. The Thomas Newman music score is so beautifully married to the film it takes my breath away time and again.  It's a long movie (3 hours, give or take a few minutes), but it always seems too short to me.I think this movie is a modern classic that will sear itself into your memory if you are capable of sitting and letting a story take hold of you while it is unfolding in front of you.I've watched ""Meet Joe Black"" many times. For anyone who has seen it and is confused about the story line, here is a both a SPOILER and my own understanding of the relationship between ""Joe"" and Claire within the story:Bill Parrish is a wealthy communications giant whose time to ""move on"" is near. He is having small heart attacks, and he is hearing a voice. ""Yes"" is the answer. The speaker is ""Death"". The question, unasked, is Bill's. The question is ""Am I dying""?.""Death"", however, is fascinated with Bill Parrish and his lifestyle. ""Death"" has been watching Bill Parrish for quite some time. Indeed, he has also been watching Bill's family. He seizes on an opportunity that comes along when a ""charming fellow"" played by Brad Pitt meets Parrish's daughter Claire in a coffee shop -- ""charming fellow"" turns her head. They are both smitten with possibilities, but each lets the other go his/her separate way. The ""charming fellow"" - distracted in a busy street intersection where he stopped to take one more look -- gets hit by two different vehicles. No one could have survived such a traumatic accidnet.""Death"" arrives at Bill Parrish's doorstep. But he's not there to take Bill right away. He has taken a body (Pitt's) and wants to experience life in the manner that Parrish lives it. As ""Death"" -- now known as ""Joe Black -- integrates himself into Bill Parrish's life, Claire falls in love with ""Joe"". At first, she's confused when she meets ""Joe"" because he doesn't seem like the same ""charming fellow"" she talked with in the coffee shop....the guy who turned her head and made her realize that ""maybe"" she wasn't really with the right person (i.e. Drew).Everything about ""Joe"" is unique and wonderful to Claire. She nails the issue when she declares, after a beautifully filmed love scene, that making love with ""Joe"" is like making love to someone ""who is making love for the first time.""At the climactic birthday party, when Joe is considering asking Claire to go with him, she is given a glimpse into who Joe really is. Joe imparts this to Claire, much in the same way that he imparted a glimpse into the next life to the old woman in the hospital. When she sees him...and says, ""Oh! I see...you're.....you're......'Joe'!"" she is saying she understands, even if she cannot possibly fathom how it was possible. That is when ""Joe"" realizes that Claire cannot possibly follow him...that he loves her too well to take her physical life from her.Restoring the ""charming fellow"" to life was ""Joe's"" gift to her. ""Charming fellow's"" memories had stopped from the moment he watched her turn the corner the one time they had met several days before...and all the rest was blurred....because the same ""Death"" who was going to take Bill Parrish was the same ""Death"" who was there to take the ""charming fellow"". Instead, ""Death"" left that fellow in a limbo while assuming his physical form (and, presumably, healing it). When ""Death"" took Bill Parrish, he returned ""charming fellow"" to his body...and there he was walking back toward Claire and probably thinking he has smoked one doobie way too many.Claire, at first hopeful, soon realizes it's the ""charming fellow"" and knows her dad is gone and that ""Joe"" has taken him/gone with him. She was in love with ""Joe"" and ""charming fellow"" has no clue that love might be in the offing, but he knows something special exists between them. She, too, realizes that ""charming fellow"" was ""Death's"" tool and a gift.",5,Death takes a gorgeous holiday,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,4121,"['As', 'wonderful', 'film', 'standard', 'DVD', 'was', 'worth', 'plunge', 'HD-DVD', 'see', 'magnificent', 'film', 'high', 'definition', 'totally', 'extraordinary.The', 'exquisite', 'production', 'design', 'added', 'depth', 'richness', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'imagined', 'camerawork', 'masterful', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'music', 'score', 'so', 'beautifully', 'married', 'film', 'breath', 'away', 'time', 'again', 'long', 'movie', '3', 'hours', 'give', 'take', 'few', 'minutes', 'always', 'too', 'short', 'me.I', 'think', 'movie', 'modern', 'classic', 'will', 'sear', 'memory', 'are', 'capable', 'sitting', 'letting', 'story', 'take', 'hold', 'unfolding', 'front', 'you.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'many', 'times', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'confused', 'story', 'line', 'here', 'SPOILER', 'own', 'understanding', 'relationship', 'Joe', 'Claire', 'story', 'Bill', 'Parrish', 'wealthy', 'communications', 'giant', 'time', 'move', 'near', 'having', 'small', 'heart', 'attacks', 'hearing', 'voice', 'Yes', 'answer', 'speaker', 'Death', 'question', 'unasked', 'Bill', 'question', 'Am', 'dying', 'Death', 'however', 'fascinated', 'Bill', 'Parrish', 'lifestyle', 'Death', 'been', 'watching', 'Bill', 'Parrish', 'quite', 'time', 'Indeed', 'also', 'been', 'watching', 'Bill', 'family', 'opportunity', 'along', 'when', 'charming', 'fellow', 'played', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Parrish', 'daughter', 'Claire', 'coffee', 'shop', 'charming', 'fellow', 'head', 'are', 'smitten', 'possibilities', 'other', 'go', 'separate', 'way', 'charming', 'fellow', 'distracted', 'busy', 'street', 'intersection', 'where', 'stopped', 'take', 'one', 'more', 'look', 'hit', 'two', 'different', 'vehicles', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'survived', 'traumatic', 'accidnet', 'Death', 'Bill', 'Parrish', 'doorstep', 'not', 'there', 'take', 'Bill', 'right', 'away', 'taken', 'body', 'Pitt', 'experience', 'life', 'manner', 'Parrish', 'lives', 'Death', 'now', 'known', 'Joe', 'Black', 'Bill', 'Parrish', 'life', 'Claire', 'love', 'Joe', 'first', 'confused', 'when', 'Joe', ""n't"", 'seem', 'same', 'charming', 'fellow', 'talked', 'coffee', 'shop', '.the', 'guy', 'who', 'turned', 'head', 'made', 'realize', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'right', 'person', 'i.e', 'Drew', '.Everything', 'Joe', 'unique', 'wonderful', 'Claire', 'issue', 'when', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'love', 'scene', 'making', 'love', 'Joe', 'making', 'love', 'someone', 'who', 'making', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'climactic', 'birthday', 'party', 'when', 'Joe', 'considering', 'asking', 'Claire', 'go', 'given', 'glimpse', 'who', 'Joe', 'really', 'Joe', 'Claire', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'imparted', 'glimpse', 'next', 'life', 'old', 'woman', 'hospital', 'When', 'Oh', 'see', ""'re"", '..you', ""'re"", 'saying', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'fathom', 'how', 'was', 'possible', 'when', 'Joe', 'Claire', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'follow', 'too', 'well', 'take', 'physical', 'life', 'her.Restoring', 'charming', 'fellow', 'life', 'was', 'Joe', 'gift', 'Charming', 'fellow', 'memories', 'had', 'stopped', 'moment', 'watched', 'turn', 'corner', 'one', 'time', 'had', 'met', 'several', 'days', 'rest', 'was', 'blurred', '.because', 'same', 'Death', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'take', 'Bill', 'Parrish', 'was', 'same', 'Death', 'who', 'was', 'there', 'take', 'charming', 'fellow', 'Instead', 'Death', 'left', 'fellow', 'limbo', 'assuming', 'physical', 'form', 'presumably', 'healing', 'When', 'Death', 'took', 'Bill', 'Parrish', 'returned', 'charming', 'fellow', 'body', 'was', 'walking', 'back', 'Claire', 'probably', 'thinking', 'smoked', 'one', 'doobie', 'way', 'too', 'many.Claire', 'first', 'hopeful', 'soon', 'charming', 'fellow', 'dad', 'gone', 'Joe', 'taken', 'him/gone', 'was', 'love', 'Joe', 'charming', 'fellow', 'clue', 'love', 'might', 'be', 'offing', 'something', 'special', 'exists', 'too', 'charming', 'fellow', 'was', 'Death', 'tool', 'gift']",N/A

If the film had stayed close to the main stiry line, it would have been completed within a timeframe that viewers appreciate more.  The dialog is slow and delivered with timely deliberation interspersed with the background music that precisely sets the mood.  Some may not appreciate this style as it allows the viewer to savor every word.  That is an unusual quality with current films that usually keep action and dialog moving at a fast pace.  The subject matter requires this slower pace to ponder the situation and fully appreciate the circumstances.

O'Blenis,"[2, 3]","One of the greatest romantic/tragic/inspirational masterpieces, ""Meet Joe Black"" stars Anthony Hopkins in probably his most outstanding performance as William Parrish, a man scheduled by the supernatural mechanics of fate to die - until the Grim Reaper (Brad Pitt, in probably his greatest performance) presents himself, not as some dark and malevolent force, but as an integral part of nature - who wishes to know what it's like to live as a mortal.  The Reaper, aka Joe Black, offers Parrish a deal in which he'll extend his life, so long as Parrish agrees to act as Black's guide in the terrestrial world.  The deal is struck, but complicated when Black (inhabiting the body of a man who briefly met William's daughter Susan Parrish - brilliantly played by Claire Forlani - and who shared a mutual attraction with her) himself meets Susan, and the two begin to develop feelings for one another.  Intense, gripping supernatural drama - rich in virtually all known emotions - about characters one quickly grows to care very much about.  It's at times dark and tragic, but manages to never be outright depressing.  At other times it's bright and hopeful, and comedic and sexy.  An outstanding movie that has much in common, thematically, with ""Ghost"" and ""The Green Mile"" (both also extremely recommended).",5,One Of The Greatest Metaphysical Dramas/Romances,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,1306,"['One', 'greatest', 'romantic/tragic/inspirational', 'masterpieces', 'Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'probably', 'most', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'William', 'Parrish', 'man', 'scheduled', 'supernatural', 'mechanics', 'fate', 'die', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'probably', 'greatest', 'performance', 'not', 'dark', 'malevolent', 'force', 'integral', 'part', 'nature', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'live', 'mortal', 'Reaper', 'Joe', 'Black', 'Parrish', 'deal', ""'ll"", 'extend', 'life', 'so', 'long', 'Parrish', 'agrees', 'act', 'Black', 'guide', 'terrestrial', 'world', 'deal', 'struck', 'complicated', 'when', 'Black', 'inhabiting', 'body', 'man', 'who', 'met', 'William', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'Parrish', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'who', 'shared', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'Susan', 'two', 'begin', 'develop', 'feelings', 'one', 'Intense', 'gripping', 'supernatural', 'drama', 'rich', 'virtually', 'known', 'emotions', 'characters', 'one', 'quickly', 'care', 'very', 'much', 'times', 'dark', 'tragic', 'never', 'be', 'outright', 'depressing', 'other', 'times', 'bright', 'hopeful', 'comedic', 'sexy', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'much', 'common', 'thematically', 'Ghost', 'Green', 'Mile', 'also', 'extremely', 'recommended']",N/A

I had seen the movie several times since 1998.

In March, 2006 I died of terminal blood cancer - yet I lived to tell about it. According to my doctors at MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston, I'm the only one to have ever survived the terminal death spiral of that illness in the entire world. Well, I died again last July of Kidney Failure, another real fatal condition.Like many others I've had out-of-body experiences before but I always had my Silver Cord when I looked behind me. But, at my death, I had no Cord. That really is the miracle of me coming back and somehow regaining my Cord.The Cord is spoken of in, at least, the Christian Book of Revelation, but many other cultural writings speak of it too.One time I caught myself flying to the Moon. I was almost there when I became aware of my little adventure. I looked behind me and sure enough there was my Cord going all the way back to New Mexico, Taos actually. I figure that I must have been about 200,000 Earth miles away, yet my Cord was still attached. No problem!I'm beginning to realize that one can feel death when it is around. Have you ever woken up after having a fabulous dream experience only to wake up again? That's what death is like - waking from a really neat dream. And you're hanging right there in the middle of Eternity and marveling at how real it seemed at the time. As it turns out life, this life, is merely a dream of the Soul.The one thing that &#34;they&#34; taught me is that it is all about Love. Love lovingly holds it all together, so to speak.thats why all of the great Mystics spoke so much about Love.So, having had that experience previously, Meet Joe Black was much more interesting.The big lie is that we die. It's just not true. There is no judgement either. Judgement is a powerful control mechanism used by religions to keep us in line. I could tell you a story to explain it but it would be too long here among comments.The &#34;Law&#34; that I was taught when I was &#34;out there&#34; is that it's all about Love. That's it!

Wauldron ""iamtoddicus""","[3, 3]","There is a reason this remake of `Death Takes A Holiday' works.Simply, this, Hopkins is Hopkins, and Pitt actually ACTS.Death assumes the body of a man Hopkin's daughter has met. Death decides he/it wants to experience the human life that he is so used to taking. The thing is, Hopkins (Bill)is not your average man, and his daughter (Susan)is not the average woman. And it near destroys him.This film is not so much about Hopkins (absolutely incredible performance as always) trying to deal with Death (he is due to die within 24 hours), as Death trying to deal with human emotions and justify his/its own actions.Pitt/Death, learns from Hopkins that there can be a morality in the powerful, and that it must be meted properly. He learns to repect the man, and also learns what love means from Hopkins daughter, Susan, whom he falls hopelessly in love with. Discovering his feelings, Death decides to take Susan, along with Bill. Hopkins (Bill), shows Death that his actions are selfish, and argues that Susan should be allowed her true future.Death is supposed to be without feeling, without remorse, but because he has assumed the guise of a man, he is flooded with emotions and ultimately the desire to do right. Something Death is not supposed to consider.Most viewers will see this as a man dealing with his impending death, but it is really about Death (set as a real figure) dealing with newfound emotions and the struggle between right and wrong.While this film may have been slow at the box-office, it is so worth seeing. The cinematography is excellent, the soundtrack excellent, and the team of Hopkins and Pitt excels. Hopkins is always good, but Pitt as Death really acts in his role. He underplays nicely, and allows the story to supercede his stardom.The dvd is 2 1/2 hours long, but I was never bored, and felt every emotion the movie was supposed to convey.This is a great love story, with a nice twist.",5,Hopkins/Pitt...a perfect match,1050278400,"04 14, 2003",2003,1921,"['reason', 'remake', 'Death', 'Takes', 'A', 'Holiday', 'works.Simply', 'Hopkins', 'Hopkins', 'Pitt', 'actually', 'ACTS.Death', 'body', 'man', 'Hopkin', 'daughter', 'met', 'Death', 'he/it', 'experience', 'human', 'life', 'so', 'used', 'taking', 'thing', 'Hopkins', 'Bill', 'not', 'average', 'man', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'not', 'average', 'woman', 'him.This', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Hopkins', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'performance', 'always', 'trying', 'deal', 'Death', 'due', 'die', '24', 'hours', 'Death', 'trying', 'deal', 'human', 'emotions', 'justify', 'his/its', 'own', 'actions.Pitt/Death', 'Hopkins', 'can', 'be', 'morality', 'powerful', 'must', 'be', 'meted', 'properly', 'repect', 'man', 'also', 'what', 'love', 'Hopkins', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'whom', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'Discovering', 'feelings', 'Death', 'take', 'Susan', 'Bill', 'Hopkins', 'Bill', 'Death', 'actions', 'are', 'selfish', 'Susan', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'true', 'future.Death', 'supposed', 'be', 'feeling', 'remorse', 'assumed', 'guise', 'man', 'flooded', 'emotions', 'ultimately', 'desire', 'do', 'right', 'Something', 'Death', 'not', 'supposed', 'consider.Most', 'viewers', 'will', 'see', 'man', 'dealing', 'impending', 'death', 'really', 'Death', 'set', 'real', 'figure', 'dealing', 'newfound', 'emotions', 'struggle', 'right', 'wrong.While', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'slow', 'box-office', 'so', 'worth', 'seeing', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'excellent', 'team', 'Hopkins', 'Pitt', 'excels', 'Hopkins', 'always', 'good', 'Pitt', 'Death', 'really', 'role', 'nicely', 'story', 'supercede', 'stardom.The', 'dvd', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'long', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'felt', 'emotion', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'convey.This', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'nice', 'twist']",N/A

A good screenwriter knows that most characters have secrets and lie about them -- and builds dialog around this. (Joe Black has a secret of cosmic significance.) Goldman & Wade don't seem to understand this, and too many scenes meander without developing any interesting tension. If there's anything worse than actors standing around talking, it's actors standing around not saying anything in particular.It's possible the 3-hour version ""works"" in a way that the 2-hour version doesn't. If it does, I'll revise this review.--------------------In my original review, I recommended the Frederic March original as superior. I watched it for a second time last night, and it was not the film I remembered. For most of its run time, it plays as an off-kilter comedy (it was directed by Mitchell Leisen), getting serious only in the last 25 minutes. It suffers from being a speculation on something no one has direct knowledge of -- the nature of death and the afterlife (if any). Its most-serious weakness is its failure to explore the relationship between Death and Grazia throughout the story, rather than leaving it until the last few minutes. Someone must have looked at the 1934 script, decided ""We can do better"", and ""Meet Joe Black"" was the result. (My only memory of the 1971 TV version is that Monte Markham made a handsome Death.)I have to disavow my praise of the special effect that ends the film. It's no more than an early version of the transporter effect in the original ""Star Trek"". It's incomprehensible that I could have remembered it as something that left my jaw on the floor.

57739,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,078322706X,Wuchak,"[3, 3]","Released in November 1998, ""Meet Joe Black"" is a re-imagining of the 1934 film ""Death Takes a Holiday"" (which I've never seen).THE STORY: The Grim Reaper (i.e. Angel of Death) comes to take billionaire industrialist Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) but instead decides to take a holiday in the corporeal universe by possessing the body of a young man who just recently died (Brad Pitt). Death's deal with  Parrish is that, as long as he's entertained, he'll delay Bill's death. Mr. Death emerges as a mysterious stranger with child-like qualities known as 'Joe Black.' His ""holiday"" is complicated when he falls in love with Parrish's daughter (Claire Forlani).This film is 3 hours long but is so captivating that it feels shorter than most 90-minute mindless action flicks. The plot is reminiscent of other good ""fish out of water"" stories like Spock in Star Trek, etc. Yes, it's outlandish but the film expertly presents the bizarre situation in a totally believable manner. In other words, this is indeed a serious drama, which nicely balances out the heavy moments with lighter (humorous) touches. I would compare it to ""The Green Mile"" which was another long drama with supernatural touches and wholly captivating.Despite its outlandish premise, ""Meet Joe Black"" consistently offers profound insights to the most vital topics of the human experience -- love, life, death and numerous others (e.g. betrayal, hostility, comeuppance and the mysterious beyond).One good example is when Parrish's son-in-law offers a definition of love to Joe Black (aka Mr. Death): To know the worst thing about someone and it's okay.This is just one example; the film is filled with such insights.""Meet Joe Black"" cost $90 million to make and only made half of it back at the USA box office. Fortunately its gone on to garner an enthusiastic following over the past decade and rightly so 'cause this is a masterpiece of film-making. I consider myself a fairly manly man, but tears flowed through appoximately 1/3 of the 3-hour runtime. This is a sign of a potent and moving picture.I can't explain why ""Meet Joe Black"" initially failed at the box office; perhaps it was the nondescript title. All I know is that it's a travesty that silly drek like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" makes gazillions of dollars and garbage like ""American Beauty"" are hailed as masterpieces while true gems like ""Joe Black"" are basically passed over.

But I have not found it too long - I've seen shorter movies that were much longer.What makes this movie odd is that it has the gauzy, high production look of Hollywood but the film has a European sensibility in that scenes tend to be lengthy. Martin Brest lets his characters actually have dialogues, complete with normal human pauses, very much similar to a European approach. If you're conditioned by rock-videos, then you'll find this a bit hard to take, I suppose. But I like the way it allows the story to breathe and unfold at its own pace.At the core of the movie is Anthony Hopkins character and the film really owes a lot to Hopkins' performance. He clearly carries the film, but quite effortlessly.It should also be noted that this film lands solidly in the field of romance - of the Shakespearian variety, not Harlequin.
