The changes in the show, like the loss of Emma and the disappearance of Adam, certainly were a factor.  Overall, I did like the season but not the ending.

People with various powers who are mutants team up to face all sorts of superhuman opponents. Excellent effects and graphics(for television) combined with TONS OF ACTION. One girl is like a female Wolverine just without the steel claws but add in slightly super strength, speed, and agility. Catwoman but slightly better in all aspects. One guy who can turn into an unbreakable substance/force field. Many others as well.

Episodic freak-of-the-week structure did nothing for me. There was no overarching story, little if any character development, etc.As in the 2nd season the hammy arch nemesis mysteriously disappeared, in the 3rd season the vaguely smug leader of Mutant X this season makes a mysterious exit in the opening episode. They also kill off one of the main ""team"" members and replace her with another chick. Sure, why not? Nothing in this show ever much makes sense.It's a pity. I'd hoped for something exceptional here. But it was more just mediocre nonsense throughout. In the end, well, really nothing happened in this series. It never really seemed to find an interesting voice or managed to say anything of note.So, I guess I'm glad it's finally over. Wanted to see if I'd missed anything while it was on the air and I never caught an episode. Didn't miss much. Won't be watching it through a second time...Honestly, I prefer most of the other teen / 20-something shows I've seen: Charmed, Roswell, Buffy, Angel. All managed to occasionally deliver something bordering on interesting. This one? Meh. Nothing too notable to see here. Was hoping for X-men & was rather disappointed. Considering it had Marvel Studios' name attached to it, I'd have thought more care would have been used and more attention paid. And it's certainly no Heroes. But, what is? Other than, well, Heroes?",3,And the 3rd and FINAL season.

930601,A1BIBCF6X4UMMN,B000AP31IS,Michele Bradley,"[3, 10]","Season three of Mutant x was good but not that good. Here where the reasons why; number one taking out Emma, she was the most powerful character in the team. In the second season you saw some of her untapped gift including her gift to communicate with the dead. It was amazing. Her character was the only thing that kept this show alive. After they killed her off, the show got boring. Number two, the action. There wasn't that much action as it was in the first two seasons. It decreased. And three, the plot of the story. Nobody knew where this show was headed and it ended up being a cliffhanger. The introduction to lexa wasn't that good because number one, they don't know who lexa is or what she wants and they just accepted her into the team. Lexa can be a bitch sometimes because how the way she would talk to them sometimes. Oh another thing, taking out the leader of Mutant x, Adam Kane was another big mistake. Without him what's the piont of still being in the team of Mutant X ? Later he comes back and the story gets interesting.
