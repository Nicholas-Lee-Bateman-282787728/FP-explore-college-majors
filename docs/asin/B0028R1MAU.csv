Course, this ain't no ordinary island, either. Prehistoric animals roam the jungles, castaways from different time periods in the past who live there aren't so welcoming to them. Their odds of escaping are slim. That, dear friends, is the premise of this movie.The film is an adaptation of the 1918 Edgar Rice Burroughs novel of the same name, and a remake of the 1975 film. As with many Asylum films, it's considered to be a low budget mockbuster. In this case, of 2009's Land of the Lost. Other than the deserted island and the Prehistoric animals similarities, there are none else to speak of.In my opinion, despite what others might think about the film, I think The Land That Time forgot is about one of the best Asylum films I've ever seen.

The cast has some knowns like Thomas and several not as well known, but still they do a decent job. The group finds other unusual inhabitants and items like a pilot and submarine from WWII that has been there for years. They all work together to try and kill the T Rex and get off the island.

The thing to keep in mind is that this is low budget film of only $600,000 so I am going to grade it on a ""B"" move scale, not a high budget one. Special effects were impressive for such a low budget piece. Certain scenes were interesting like when they got scientific at times and while acting was nothing spectacular the plotting of the tale was done well and the inclusion of various elements were better than average. Interesting enough way to off the T Rex. The Lindsey character, while pretty to look at, could have been more developed character wise and yeah I get she was mainly intended as eye candy in her short shorts. C. Thomas Howell directed and starred in this ""mockbuster"" film. Mockbuster films was a name dubbed by the press for lower budget films that attempted to capitalize on major studio releases. This was probably tied into the remake of LAND OF THE LOST. Of course, if you watch the Special Features section on the making of this film you can see that everybody is having a good time and nobody is trying to do Shakespeare yet they are trying to produce a direct to video film that will be entertaining to some people. Note that both this film and the old one are based on a 1918 novel of the same name by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Ironically, some claim Burroughs was trying to capitalize on similar stories that were hits with the masses. Two such notable hit novels by authors Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (LOST WORLD) and Jules Verne (THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND).

My thought is, if the book was good enough for you to want to make a movie of it, why are you changing things?  However, though this definitely changed things from the E.R.B. book, I loved it!It had elements from the book.  The Germans and their U-boat were there, but it was more just an island in the Bermuda Triangle with dinosaurs on it.  Even so, the story was good.  The acting was good and for a low-budget movie the special effects were really good.  I have to give kudos to C. Thomas Howell for great directing.It begins on a small boat in a storm.  There are two couples, plus the captain and his mate.  The next morning, when the storm is gone, they have no idea where they are.  They spot an island and decide to head for it.  They drop anchor and all but one head for shore.  They soon discover pterodactyls and a t-rex, and upon finding the beach once more, discover the boat is gone.  Not long afterwards, they discover they aren't the only people on the island, some of which include Nazi's and a U-boat, stranded during WWII, which for them has only been a year or so..The only options available on the DVD are ""Play"" and ""Chapters"" which is slightly disappointing as I would have loved to see a ""Making of"".

1255914,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0028R1MAU,trebe,"[1, 2]","The Land That Time Forgot (2009), is a modern interpretation, of Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic fantasy tale, where travelers on a small boat, encounter strange circumstances during a storm, land on a small island, and encounter dinosaurs, and other travelers also trapped there, from various periods in time.There are several plots twists that keep things interesting, one involves the presence of a German WWII era submarine, and members of her crew, who considering the situation, turn out to be some very mellow sailors.  The discovery that there is oil on the island, provides a reason for the survivors to work together, to try and find a way to escape, as they set up their own refinery.A film of the same name was released in 1975, and this version has kind of a retro 70's vibe.  The feature could easily have been more harsh or violent, but things are rather subdued.  The one gunbattle that takes place, is sanitized, and no one gets hurt.  The German sailors are cooperative, instead of being hardened killers.  The special effects are not bad, and the raptors that are the main threat, are fairly well done.  Dinosaurs do chomp a couple of people, but that is the most violent thing you will see, in this lightweight adventure.C. Thomas Howell (The Hitcher), both stars and directs this feature, that has decent production values, and a fairly competent cast, that also includes Timothy Bottoms, Scott Subiono, and Darren Dalton, who also wrote the screenplay.  If you happen to see this on your cable schedule, you might what to check it out.

Although I did watch this entire movie, I just can't give it more than 2 stars.The acting isn't that great, the story isn't much better. There's tons of action, but the action lacks suspense so it just falls flat. The animation on the dinosaurs really isn't that great, although I could have overlooked that if there weren't so many other grievances. A few times there was a line said that was meant to be funny, but it just wasn't...even if it had been just the slightest bit humorous, the delivery wasn't good enough to get a laugh from the viewer.Content Advisory:For some reason I thought this was PG, but it's actually ""Not Rated"". There were no bedroom scenes, but there is a fair amount of language. Most is on the milder side of the scale (but there's quite a bit of it), and there were also at least 5 ""s"" words and one (possibly?) ""f"" word. I'm posting this as I would have found this information helpful before deciding to watch this, and hopefully someone else will find it helpful.I feel like this could have been a fun adventure film if some things (ALOT of things) had been done differently....like, a different cast, a script re-write, and a bigger budget.

1255917,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0028R1MAU,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","The 1975 version of Edgar Rice Burroughs' ""The Land that Time Forgot / The People that Time Forgot (Midnite Movies Double Feature)"" with Doug McClure featured lame puppet-type dinosaurs, but made up for it with well-developed characters and a huge subtext, which was surprising for such a seemingly simple story.This made-for-TV 2009 version changes everthing and I'm sort of glad because we already have the original that followed Burroughs' book pretty faithfully. The only similarity between this version and Burroughs' story is that there's an uncharted island, castaways, Germans, a U-boat and dinosaurs. That's it. This version features some sort of dimensional gateway where modern people and others from the last century meet on Caprona, the island. They try to figure out how to escape, how to get along and how to contend with dinosaurs, mostly a T-rex. Speaking of which, the T-rex doesn't look too bad for this type of micro-budget sci-fi, just don't expect ""Jurassic Park"" quality (although the story's arguably better).C. Thomas Howell directed the film and is also a member of the likable cast. I appreciate the camaraderie that develops between the Americans and the Germans. Speaking of which, the WWI Germans are pretty convincing.As far as women go, Lindsey McKeon is the highlight as a shapely brunette, but there's also a good-looking blond (Anya Benton).FINAL WORD: Although it doesn't follow Burroughs' book at all, this 2009 TV version of ""The Land that Time Forgot"" is a worthwhile lost-on-a-deserted-island flick in the tradition of ""Mysterious Island (Widescreen)"" and others, like ""Planet of the Dinosaurs"". If you enjoy movies of this ilk, you'll probably appreciate this one.The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, Long Beach and Malibu, CA.GRADE: B-",4,A quality lost-on-deserted-island flick,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,1809,"['1975', 'version', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'Land', 'Time', 'Forgot', 'People', 'Time', 'Forgot', 'Midnite', 'Movies', 'Double', 'Feature', 'Doug', 'McClure', 'featured', 'lame', 'puppet-type', 'dinosaurs', 'made', 'up', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'huge', 'subtext', 'was', 'surprising', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'story.This', 'made-for-TV', '2009', 'version', 'changes', 'everthing', ""'m"", 'sort', 'glad', 'already', 'have', 'original', 'followed', 'Burroughs', 'book', 'pretty', 'faithfully', 'only', 'similarity', 'version', 'Burroughs', 'story', 'uncharted', 'island', 'castaways', 'Germans', 'U-boat', 'dinosaurs', 'version', 'sort', 'dimensional', 'gateway', 'where', 'modern', 'people', 'others', 'last', 'century', 'meet', 'Caprona', 'island', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'escape', 'how', 'get', 'along', 'how', 'contend', 'dinosaurs', 'mostly', 'T-rex', 'Speaking', 'T-rex', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'bad', 'type', 'micro-budget', 'sci-fi', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'quality', 'story', 'arguably', 'better', '.C', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'directed', 'film', 'also', 'member', 'likable', 'cast', 'appreciate', 'camaraderie', 'Americans', 'Germans', 'Speaking', 'WWI', 'Germans', 'are', 'pretty', 'convincing.As', 'far', 'women', 'go', 'Lindsey', 'McKeon', 'highlight', 'shapely', 'brunette', 'also', 'good-looking', 'blond', 'Anya', 'Benton', '.FINAL', 'WORD', ""n't"", 'follow', 'Burroughs', 'book', '2009', 'TV', 'version', 'Land', 'Time', 'Forgot', 'worthwhile', 'lost-on-a-deserted-island', 'flick', 'tradition', 'Mysterious', 'Island', 'Widescreen', 'others', 'Planet', 'Dinosaurs', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'ilk', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'appreciate', 'one.The', 'film', '90', 'minutes', 'was', 'shot', 'Griffith', 'Park', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Long', 'Beach', 'Malibu', 'CA.GRADE', 'B-']",The Land That Time Forgot
