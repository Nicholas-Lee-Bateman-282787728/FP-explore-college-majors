1537553,A33KSWZU6E7TMU,B007SXKQBA,Christy Lindsay,"[4, 5]","I was thrilled to see this DVD was finally available. I fell in love with this show on A&E.; The family is great: Christian, honest, FUNNY, and loyal to each other. It's good, clean fun. Where can you see this on TV or DVD these days? I bought it almost as soon as I saw the DVD was available.I'm disappointed in the DVD, though. I should've known the DVD wouldn't be crystal clear when I saw the price point. I thought the Robinson family wanted to get the DVD on the market fast. But the DVD isn't as clear as the TV version. I don't even have a high definition TV, and the A&E; broadcast was way clearer than the DVD version.As other reviewers wrote, there are no special features, but that doesn't bother me at all.What DOES bother me, though, is that they don't play ""Sharp Dressed Man"" on the opening sequence. This is one of my favorite parts of the show. I doubled over laughing the first time I saw four men in tux jackets and Muck Boots step out of a limo to the tune of ""Sharp Dressed Man."" The DVD title song isn't half as good as ""Sharp Dressed Man.""I'm sure they'll come out with a different version of the DVD at a higher price, so you might want to wait. But if you're just looking to watch the show, this DVD is adequate.",3,"Love the Show, but DVD is low quality",1347408000,"09 12, 2012",2012,1238,"['was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'DVD', 'was', 'finally', 'available', 'fell', 'love', 'show', 'A', 'E', 'family', 'great', 'Christian', 'honest', 'FUNNY', 'loyal', 'other', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'Where', 'can', 'see', 'TV', 'DVD', 'days', 'bought', 'almost', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'DVD', 'was', 'available.I', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'should', ""'ve"", 'known', 'DVD', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'crystal', 'clear', 'when', 'saw', 'price', 'point', 'thought', 'Robinson', 'family', 'wanted', 'get', 'DVD', 'market', 'fast', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'as', 'clear', 'TV', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'high', 'definition', 'TV', 'A', 'E', 'broadcast', 'was', 'way', 'clearer', 'DVD', 'version.As', 'other', 'reviewers', 'wrote', 'are', 'special', 'features', ""n't"", 'bother', 'all.What', 'DOES', 'bother', 'though', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'Sharp', 'Dressed', 'Man', 'opening', 'sequence', 'one', 'favorite', 'parts', 'show', 'doubled', 'over', 'laughing', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'four', 'men', 'tux', 'jackets', 'Muck', 'Boots', 'step', 'out', 'limo', 'tune', 'Sharp', 'Dressed', 'Man', 'DVD', 'title', 'song', ""n't"", 'half', 'as', 'good', 'Sharp', 'Dressed', 'Man', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'come', 'out', 'different', 'version', 'DVD', 'higher', 'price', 'might', 'want', 'wait', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'watch', 'show', 'DVD', 'adequate']",N/A
