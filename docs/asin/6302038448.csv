But very ill she is, and when she falls into fever dreams, she enters a world created by her own drawings. Living in this world, stretched between dreams and reality is Marc [Elliot Spiers], a boy who is dangerously ill as well. Together, Anna and Marc try to save themselves from the demons that their illnesses bring. Amazing sets capture perfectly the feel of a fever dream, and the excellent acting of the two children make this a intelligent, mesmerizing, unforgettable movie. It will appeal to horror fans and non-horror fans alike.",5,Stunning sets perfectly capture the fever dreams of a child.,1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,645,"['Anna', '[', 'Charlotte', 'Burke', ']', 'difficult', 'girl', 'one', 'quite', 'when', 'feeling', 'ill', 'very', 'ill', 'when', 'fever', 'dreams', 'world', 'created', 'own', 'drawings', 'Living', 'world', 'stretched', 'dreams', 'reality', 'Marc', '[', 'Elliot', 'Spiers', ']', 'boy', 'who', 'dangerously', 'ill', 'as', 'well', 'Together', 'Anna', 'Marc', 'try', 'save', 'demons', 'illnesses', 'bring', 'Amazing', 'sets', 'capture', 'perfectly', 'feel', 'fever', 'dream', 'excellent', 'acting', 'two', 'children', 'make', 'intelligent', 'mesmerizing', 'unforgettable', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'horror', 'fans', 'non-horror', 'fans', 'alike']",Paperhouse VHS

There is a whole scene missing which is a discussion she has with a friend about kissing, and the part where the girl pushes her off her chair is gone too.. which makes it make no sense because she actually says .. she was pushed off her chair.

We had a VHS copy and I bought a region-free DVD player just so I could play my region 2 version of this eerie film. Ben Cross is great as the father who is blind in the dream-world his daughter lives in every night. Creepy and thought provoking this film stands as a solid family favorite to this day.

You can tell she is lonely and unhappy, her father is away and she is not well so she spends a lot of time in bed, whiling away the hours by drawing.Anna soon finds herself dreaming about the house she has drawn, and in the house is a boy who she becomes friends with.  In her bid to help her dream friend she adds things to her drawing but in doing so endangers not only him but herself.Their only hope is to get away from the house but the house is surrounded by sinister stones that are moving toward the house and its captive occupants and in desperation Anna draws a helicopter to come and rescue them and it is here we are realise that Anna's dreams have their basis in reality and only her father can save her just as only she can save her friend in the paper house...",4,Odd but strangely watchable,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,1030,"['agree', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'world', 'still', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'are', 'making', 'out.It', 'quite', 'atmospheric', 'own', 'way', 'little', 'girl', 'played', 'unknown', 'Charlotte', 'Burke', 'lonely', 'Anna', 'surprising', 'depth', 'can', 'tell', 'lonely', 'unhappy', 'father', 'away', 'not', 'well', 'lot', 'time', 'bed', 'whiling', 'away', 'hours', 'drawing.Anna', 'soon', 'dreaming', 'house', 'drawn', 'house', 'boy', 'who', 'friends', 'bid', 'help', 'dream', 'friend', 'things', 'drawing', 'doing', 'so', 'endangers', 'not', 'only', 'only', 'hope', 'get', 'away', 'house', 'house', 'surrounded', 'sinister', 'stones', 'are', 'moving', 'house', 'captive', 'occupants', 'desperation', 'Anna', 'helicopter', 'come', 'rescue', 'here', 'are', 'realise', 'Anna', 'dreams', 'have', 'basis', 'reality', 'only', 'father', 'can', 'save', 'just', 'only', 'can', 'save', 'friend', 'paper', 'house']",Paperhouse VHS
293301,A380XMMAQGW34E,6302038448,"Kevin Coughlan ""Killer7""","[2, 29]","From the director, Bernard Rose, I was expecting another great film after seeing the magnificent achievement of Candyman. By god was I wrong. This film is, without a doubt, the biggest dissapointment I had ever come across and possibly one of the worst films I had ever seen. With a rediculous plot and, oh my god, the acting was absolutely dreadful I almost turned it off half way through. But I couldnt judge something I havent seen fully. I have noticed some may think that this is one of those films that is not for the fans of violence and gore which is absolutely right. But neither is this for fans of the psychological themes with no violence. I agree completely that horror needs no violence whatsoever to be a success. Take the Blair Witch for instance. But not even violence could save this garbage.
