One would think that name would not be hard to forget, but this is one of his best in my opinion. Michael J. Fox has long been one of my favorite actors ever since the Back to the Future trilogy, and ""For Love or Money"" is one of the reasons why. He gives a stellar performance in this film, just as he did in Doc hollywood and The Secrets To My Success. I enjoyed watching this film over and over again since I first bought it some years ago now. It is packed with lighthearted drama and comedy that is sure to satisfy most anyone just looking for a good entertaining film. It is a very well writting screenplay, the casting is terrific as is the acting, and it will hold your attention right up to the end.It might not have won an academy award, but it is certainly worth a watch.

753054,AY12DBB0U420B,B00009AOBH,Gary Peterson,"[1, 4]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""For Love or Money"" starring Michael J. Fox. It was one part of a four-part compilation DVD. Th movie had Fox starring as a high-end hotel concierge, not a bellboy, in New York City. He seemed to know everyone and knew just how to help them, and they loved him for it. He was frugal and had dreams of one day having his own hotel. We followed him on his day to day routine for about the first quarter of the movie. It was not terribly interesting.Fox was smitten by the mistress of a sleazy and creepy investor (a man of money who might fund fox's hotel dream) and watched his dream girl in his clutches. Meanwhile, he went about his concierge-servant business of keeping everyone supplied with their special needs as he became ever more harassed by an IRS Investigator. The sleazebag investor agreed to help fund his dream hotel at just about the same time that such investor was ready to drop his affiliation with his mistress, ie., Foxe's dream girl. Then everything collapsed, in order to rebuild in a different way. Was it funny? Not particularly. Was it touching? Not really. Was it interesting? No, and I had a real struggle continuing to watch the last third of the movie. The photography and sound were good. The acting was acceptable. The story was very hard to believe. All in all, the movie was a comedic dud, except that Fox fans seem to love it.Gary Peterson",3,Not Very Interesting. Hard To Believe.
