858773,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B00064AE0G,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[3, 4]","I generally dislike film critics, but this was one film I trusted the opinions of critics more than that of the moviegoers. I heard all kinds of rants and whining about how ""It's the worst movie ever."" ""It's so boring."" I'm really tired of people whose goals seem to be to trash indie films even if they're good, like this. Here's some advice for you if you're considering it. 1. Don't expect Jaws. Just because it has a shark fin on the cover doesn't mean it's about sharks. 2. This is not action-packed. It is dialogue-focused. 3. Don't expect a grand plot. The story is incredibly simple, but well-executed. 4. Don't watch this if you're easily bored, or you're going to piss and moan about how much you hate it.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: When Susan and Daniel go on vacation on a tropical island as part of Susan's job, they decide to go scuba diving. Everything's going fine, just exploring the ocean depths and observing the creatures beneath. But when the tour guide miscounts the total number of people who return, Susan and Daniel are left behind in the middle of the ocean. Now they must try and survive and wait for someone to come and rescue them. The story then focuses on how the couple's mental states slowly deteriorate; they argue, they yell, and they blame each other for being left behind. They also fear what lies beneath them as sharks start to gather around them; just waiting. The two must stay close or they may get separated by the waves.MUSIC: There is practically none, which is a bit of a downer because it could have used it in some parts. The music that is there is strange, but fairly good.ACTION: This is not action-focused, it is focused on dialogue almost exclusively. There are some attack scenes from the ocean wildlife though. This film is mostly trying to fill you with a sense of dread and keeping you on edge, waiting for what happens next. It achieves this with great success. That's what it succeeds at; atmosphere and tone.ACTING: These actors were very believable and their performances are capable of out-shining Hollywood vets. They did give you the sense that they were afraid as well as other emotions which are achieved with great finesse. Bravo to these fantastic actors.OVERALL: If you truly have taste in films, you will buy this sublime film. This is one of the best independent films ever made and is an underrated masterpiece that is destined to go down as a classic. Sorry moviegoers, but this time I discredit and condemn your opinions about this excellent film and go with the critics on this one. It was absolutely amazing.THE GOOD: The simple, but well-executed storyline, the performances by the actors, the small bits of good music, and it does a fantastic job of making you guess and fear what comes next.THE BAD: Slow in some parts and little music.",5,A SUPERB AND THOUGHT-PROVOKING EXPERIENCE  9.5 OUT OF 10,1244851200,"06 13, 2009",2009,2803,"['generally', 'dislike', 'film', 'critics', 'was', 'one', 'film', 'trusted', 'opinions', 'critics', 'more', 'moviegoers', 'heard', 'kinds', 'rants', 'whining', 'how', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'so', 'boring', ""'m"", 'really', 'tired', 'people', 'goals', 'seem', 'be', 'trash', 'indie', 'films', 'even', ""'re"", 'good', 'Here', 'advice', ""'re"", 'considering', '1', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Jaws', 'Just', 'shark', 'fin', 'cover', ""n't"", 'mean', 'sharks', '2', 'not', 'action-packed', 'dialogue-focused', '3', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'grand', 'plot', 'story', 'incredibly', 'simple', 'well-executed', '4', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', ""'re"", 'easily', 'bored', ""'re"", 'going', 'piss', 'moan', 'how', 'much', 'hate', 'it.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'When', 'Susan', 'Daniel', 'go', 'vacation', 'tropical', 'island', 'part', 'Susan', 'job', 'decide', 'go', 'scuba', 'diving', 'Everything', 'going', 'fine', 'just', 'exploring', 'ocean', 'depths', 'observing', 'creatures', 'beneath', 'when', 'tour', 'guide', 'total', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'return', 'Susan', 'Daniel', 'are', 'left', 'middle', 'ocean', 'Now', 'must', 'try', 'survive', 'wait', 'someone', 'come', 'rescue', 'story', 'then', 'how', 'couple', 'mental', 'states', 'slowly', 'deteriorate', 'argue', 'yell', 'blame', 'other', 'being', 'left', 'behind', 'also', 'fear', 'what', 'beneath', 'sharks', 'start', 'gather', 'just', 'waiting', 'two', 'must', 'stay', 'close', 'may', 'get', 'separated', 'waves.MUSIC', 'practically', 'none', 'bit', 'downer', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'parts', 'music', 'strange', 'fairly', 'good.ACTION', 'not', 'action-focused', 'focused', 'dialogue', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'are', 'attack', 'scenes', 'ocean', 'wildlife', 'film', 'mostly', 'trying', 'fill', 'sense', 'dread', 'keeping', 'edge', 'waiting', 'what', 'next', 'great', 'success', 'what', 'tone.ACTING', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'believable', 'performances', 'are', 'capable', 'out-shining', 'Hollywood', 'vets', 'did', 'give', 'sense', 'were', 'afraid', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'emotions', 'are', 'achieved', 'great', 'finesse', 'Bravo', 'fantastic', 'actors.OVERALL', 'truly', 'have', 'taste', 'films', 'will', 'buy', 'sublime', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'independent', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'underrated', 'masterpiece', 'destined', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'classic', 'Sorry', 'moviegoers', 'time', 'discredit', 'condemn', 'opinions', 'excellent', 'film', 'go', 'critics', 'one', 'was', 'absolutely', 'amazing.THE', 'GOOD', 'simple', 'well-executed', 'storyline', 'performances', 'actors', 'small', 'bits', 'good', 'music', 'fantastic', 'job', 'making', 'guess', 'fear', 'what', 'next.THE', 'BAD', 'Slow', 'parts', 'little', 'music']",N/A

858776,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00064AE0G,A. Estes,"[5, 6]","I can see why a lot of people didn't enjoy, or rather, ""get"" ""Open Water."" For starters, the previews and the hype surrounding it make it seem like the next ""Jaws,"" which it isn't. It doesn't even try to be. Also, it's very short and there isn't much action, with a lot of the drama being drawn from your own imagination. What we have here is a movie that plays on much deeper fears than what's swimming around you. I'll tell you right now, I liked this movie a lot. It got me hooked and left a lasting impression. Shot entirely on digital video, and clocking in at just under 80 minutes, ""Open Water"" tells the tale (based on a true story (or stories)) of an attractive couple (Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis) whom, while on a vacation, accidentally get left behind on a scuba diving trip. As they drift further and further away from any signs on life, and closer to dangerous waters, drama ensues. If they didn't have relationship problems before, they do now. Like I said before, not much really ""happens"" in this movie, but you do get involved in the characters and their struggle. The way the movie was shot helps you feel the emotions a bit more. In the beginning of the movie, the low-budget approach was distracting, but served well when the movie really needed it. My only gripe is the constant cutting away to the mainland tendency the director has. If it had been 100% focused on the couple, the movie would have been the better for it. Our leads are very sympathetic and very real. They panic, they get angry at each other, they take care of and try to comfort each other. And they have to be that way. If these characters were anything but real, the movie would have been a total bomb. Afterall, there are no ""special"" effects, and not too much action. But this is the kind of movie that will make you appreciate your loved ones, or even your life a little more. The DVD has quite a wealth of bonus features, including two commentaries, one from Blanchard and Travis, and another from real-life couple, director Chris Kentis and producer Laura Lau. A handful of deleted scenes and a making-of feature that is actually interesting rounds out this package nicely.

858777,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00064AE0G,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 6]","I am a horror movie type of guy.  Normally I can sit through the average horror film and not flinch or scream in any way.  It would have to take a totally thrilling film to move my mind into a state of fear.  Open Water did that for me.  I didn't sit down the entire film.  Walking around the room and keeping my eyes covered seemed to be mandatory for watching this semi-documentary tale.  The powerful cinematography, the strength of the story, and the sheer terror of the deep unknown sent my mind into a frenzy.  Director Chris Kentis has done something that we never experienced with the film Jaws.  In Open Water, he puts us in the water and gives us that feeling as if we are right there with the divers as they experience the open sea.  In Jaws, we could easily say that this was just a movie and was created by Hollywood to scare us.  This was a true story.  These events, while maybe created some by the independent eye, did happen to real people.  To me, that is what makes this film 100-times better than Jaws and 100-times more terrifying.To begin, the way that Kentis chose to film this was brilliant.  Half-documentary, half Blair Witch Project, he places us right in the water with our unknown victims.  He gives us, especially on the big screen, that feeling of bobbing up and down in the water, the vast openness of the ocean, and just that overall sensation of being lost out at sea.  I think this would be more frightening than being lost in the woods, because in the woods there are ways to protect yourself, in the ocean you are not in control.  This was obvious from the opening scene where in just a few minutes our characters had drifted away from their meeting location.  It was frightening for me to see them just floating there, going further and further into the unknown.  The sharks were terrifying, one of the last scenes of the film really captures the scariness of the sharks, the devastation of the divers, and the inevitable terror of what was to come.  It was this human element that freaked me out the most.  While the sharks were terrifying, it was the overall fact that this could have happened to anyone; to me, to you, to friends ... anyone.  There is no supernatural force behind this event, it is reality and it couldn't keep me seated.  As I watched these divers went through the emotions of being lost, I couldn't help but see myself in that same situation.  I think that is where Kentis did exceptionally well.  He was able to take us, the viewers, out of our couches and into the ocean like no other film had.  I could see myself in that ocean with my wife, and it was the mental strain that scared me in this film.  For that, I can only applaud Kentis.The acting wasn't great, in fact, it was very poor.  The actors, Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis, did their jobs, but could have been a bit more emotional throughout the time in the ocean.  This is hard for me to judge because I was basing so much of what they were doing on how I would react.  Perhaps others think that they were reacting, as they should because it was how they would react.  Who knows?  All I know is that I would have been scared out of my mind if I came out of the water and our boat was nowhere to be found, these two just seemed a bit too calm for my liking.  A bit more story on these two would have been nice as well.  There is a scene when they are in the water and they are talking about their planning stages for this vacation that seemed very jumbled to me.  I didn't quite understand what they were talking about and could have used that frustration at the beginning of the film, not near the end.  A few more minutes at the beginning of the film would have helped with the climactic ending quite a bit.Overall, I thought that this was a brilliantly created film.  The pacing seemed to be perfect, the terror was obviously there, and the cinematography really pulled you from your couch and into the ocean.  I have continually heard that Open Water was no Jaws, and I couldn't agree more.  This wasn't a film about sharks, while they were a crucial element to the film, I saw this movie as more of a psychological film.  The situations happening in our character's minds, the physical pressures that were beading down on them as the hours clicked by, and the emotional strain of knowing that possibly nobody would ever find them is what took this film to a new level.  This was one of those rare horror films that had me on the edge of my seat until the very realistic ending.  After watching it, I couldn't help thinking of it and how jumpy it made me.  This film created some nervousness for getting back into the ocean during our next vacation.  It was honestly that powerful and I suggest it to anyone that is looking for a very powerful scare.  You will not be disappointed.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,Oh God!

Writer/director/editor and cinematographer Chris Kentis managed to make this film on an amazingly low $ 130,000 (the sharks worked for tuna), and mostly we are just watching the 2 actors (Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis) as they bob about in the waves, trying to mentally and physically survive their horrendous predicament, and go through the predictable psychological changes (""the blame game,"" etc).The location has been changed from Australia to a Caribbean paradise, and has some underwater shots with colorful fish at the start of the film, before they are left to fend off the sharks and the jellyfish. I have often thought of the Lonergan case, thinking it one of the most terrifying scenarios anyone could go through, and Kentis has captured some of what they are presumed to have experienced. The ending is what makes me like this film, as it doesn't go ""Hollywood"" on its audience, and manages to combine the horror of the situation with some dark humor. The camerawork is often jumpy, the script sometimes lame, and acting at times unconvincing, but if the Australian tragedy fascinated you, this take on it will hold your interest, and I'm adding an extra star for the final 10 minutes of the film.",4,Shark Bait,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,1496,"['Loosely', 'based', '1998', 'case', 'Tom', 'Eileen', 'Lonergan', 'who', 'were', 'left', 'behind', 'Great', 'Barrier', 'Reef', 'Australian', 'diving', 'vacation', 'Open', 'Water', 'mini-budget', 'film', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'many', 'amateurish', 'moments', 'provide', 'unintended', 'laughs', 'Writer/director/editor', 'cinematographer', 'Chris', 'Kentis', 'managed', 'make', 'film', 'amazingly', 'low', '130,000', 'sharks', 'worked', 'tuna', 'mostly', 'are', 'just', 'watching', '2', 'actors', 'Blanchard', 'Ryan', 'Daniel', 'Travis', 'bob', 'waves', 'trying', 'mentally', 'physically', 'survive', 'horrendous', 'predicament', 'go', 'predictable', 'psychological', 'changes', 'blame', 'game', 'etc', '.The', 'location', 'been', 'changed', 'Australia', 'Caribbean', 'paradise', 'underwater', 'shots', 'colorful', 'fish', 'start', 'film', 'are', 'left', 'fend', 'off', 'sharks', 'jellyfish', 'have', 'often', 'thought', 'Lonergan', 'case', 'thinking', 'one', 'most', 'terrifying', 'scenarios', 'anyone', 'could', 'go', 'Kentis', 'captured', 'what', 'are', 'presumed', 'have', 'experienced', 'ending', 'what', 'film', ""n't"", 'go', 'Hollywood', 'audience', 'combine', 'horror', 'situation', 'dark', 'humor', 'camerawork', 'often', 'jumpy', 'script', 'sometimes', 'lame', 'acting', 'times', 'unconvincing', 'Australian', 'tragedy', 'fascinated', 'take', 'will', 'hold', 'interest', ""'m"", 'adding', 'extra', 'star', 'final', '10', 'minutes', 'film']",N/A

The film lacks many requisite elements of successful ventures. Shot on a shoestring budget, there is almost no production value. The use of unknown actors hurts the cause. No script, or plot to speak of, really impedes progress. Perhaps the final nail is how thoroughly unlikable the characters are.  These whiny yuppies, who would rather bicker than cooperate during a life or death crisis, will have you rooting for the sharks in no time.Speaking of time, here is the real crusher. 90% of this hour-plus of your life you'll never get back is devoted to watching these two human bobbers floating. Presumably this technique is intended to give viewers the claustrophobic sense of real-time dread, just as the end of the movie Titanic was shot in real time. In that film the effect was amazement as viewers witnessed astonishing events played out in short minutes. Here the effect is reversed.

I wasn't quite as ruthless, thus the two star review instead of the one star review.  It stunk in many ways, however, as an indie film it does have some things going for it.The basic idea is very interesting, however, unlike the book (not the film) The Perfect Storm, in which a loss at sea is made the center piece of a story that covers all the surrounding facts and then only makes a few guesses at what actually happened, this film is almost entirely composed of what might have happened.  It may be based upon a true event, however, nearly the entire film is hypothetical so it may as well have been just called fiction.I've been out to sea before, and once, in a moment of curiosity, I asked the captain if I could jump into the ocean.  We were out far enough that neither land nor the bottom was visible and even though I was just feet from the boat, and there was no chance of me being left there, it was the scariest thing I've ever done.  Totally freaky.  That said, I could guess that the couple left at sea went into a state of fear almost immediately, however, anything beyond that would be total speculation.In order to make this movie work, they had to come up with plausible action and possible events with sharks, far off boats, and dialogue.  These elements obviously are what made or broke the movie, and my opinion, and that of many others, is that they just missed the boat here.  Pardon the pun.I couldn't believe how they acted and  I couldn't believe the way the events unfolded.  I don't care about the low budget aspects of the film, the multi-million dollar film version of the very good book The Perfect Storm, made these same stupid types of mistakes.  They couldn't resist making it unbelievable in an attempt to create drama.  I guess it's a film thing.Anyway, I'm not going to recommend this unless you've got some morbid curiosity that has to be satisfied.  There are a couple places that induce some tension and might even make you jump.  It certainly can bring up some topics of conversation, even my sister, who hated it, wanted to talk about all the different things that she would have done or I would have done differently.

858786,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00064AE0G,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I will say, I'm baffled by all the poor notices for this film.  Maybe too many people were expecting something more extreme or gory or aggressive.  What we have is something more chilling than scary, and for the subject I think it works very well.  No, this is not a perfect film, but it serves up effective scares and, when all is said and done, it is heartbreaking.`Open Water' tells the true story of a young couple out for a scuba diving excursion that are left behind by their tour boat in shark infested waters.  I think most everyone knows coming in that these two individuals are eventually eaten by the sharks.  It is inevitable.  There is no skirting around that fact.  It is based on a true story.  It is getting to that moment that sets the tone for the film.  So maybe the thrills are deadened by the fact that we know nothing can happen until the very end, so while fins pop up out of the blue we may not squirm as much as we expected we would (I did) but the fact still remains that the eerie tone captured in nearly every frame (thanks in large part to the way the film was shot, using an almost home video quality) is undeniable.As some have mentioned, this has a lot to do with the war between these two individuals (a couple on the verge of separation) and the way within themselves as it does to do with the war to survive.  It is in this aspect of the film that I found a bit of frustration.  It never felt truly explored.  The obviousness of the situation was there, presented to us, but never fleshed out like I wanted it to be.  It is because of this that both Susan and Daniel become almost unsympathetic and the film betrays its own inhibitions by giving us characters that are hard for us to care about past their perilous situation.  The film, in effect, becomes all about the circumstance and less about the entirety of the situation, which is sad because it was obviously trying to cover all those bases.Still, there are many aspects of the film that work, and I must commend both Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis for finding a balance in presenting to us two `real people', never glossing over those ticks that make these people real and yet never straying too far into creating something overtly awkward.  They worked just right in their respective roles and portrayed the terror of their situation perfectly.It is not `Jaws' and it is not even `The Blair Witch Project', although it is compared to both of those films and pretty much comes off as a hybrid of each.  It is unfair in a way to compare though since it is an entirely different animal.  Just because there is a handheld camera a sharks in the water doesn't automatically warrant the comparisons.  Still, on its own, it stands up and deserves to be noticed.",4,"Drops the ball in a key area, and yet it rises to the plate in others...",1354060800,"11 28, 2012",2012,2751,"['will', 'say', ""'m"", 'baffled', 'poor', 'notices', 'film', 'Maybe', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'expecting', 'something', 'more', 'extreme', 'gory', 'aggressive', 'What', 'have', 'something', 'more', 'chilling', 'scary', 'subject', 'think', 'very', 'well', 'No', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'up', 'effective', 'scares', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'heartbreaking.', 'Open', 'Water', 'true', 'story', 'young', 'couple', 'scuba', 'diving', 'excursion', 'are', 'left', 'tour', 'boat', 'shark', 'infested', 'waters', 'think', 'most', 'everyone', 'coming', 'two', 'individuals', 'are', 'eventually', 'eaten', 'sharks', 'inevitable', 'skirting', 'around', 'fact', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'getting', 'moment', 'tone', 'film', 'maybe', 'thrills', 'are', 'deadened', 'fact', 'know', 'nothing', 'can', 'happen', 'very', 'end', 'so', 'fins', 'pop', 'up', 'blue', 'may', 'not', 'squirm', 'as', 'much', 'expected', 'would', 'did', 'fact', 'still', 'eerie', 'tone', 'captured', 'nearly', 'frame', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'using', 'almost', 'home', 'video', 'quality', 'undeniable.As', 'have', 'mentioned', 'lot', 'do', 'war', 'two', 'individuals', 'couple', 'verge', 'separation', 'way', 'do', 'war', 'survive', 'aspect', 'film', 'found', 'bit', 'frustration', 'never', 'felt', 'truly', 'explored', 'obviousness', 'situation', 'was', 'there', 'presented', 'never', 'fleshed', 'wanted', 'be', 'Susan', 'Daniel', 'become', 'almost', 'unsympathetic', 'film', 'own', 'inhibitions', 'giving', 'characters', 'are', 'hard', 'care', 'past', 'perilous', 'situation', 'film', 'effect', 'circumstance', 'less', 'entirety', 'situation', 'sad', 'was', 'obviously', 'trying', 'cover', 'bases.Still', 'are', 'many', 'aspects', 'film', 'work', 'must', 'commend', 'Blanchard', 'Ryan', 'Daniel', 'Travis', 'finding', 'balance', 'presenting', 'two', 'real', 'people', 'never', 'glossing', 'ticks', 'make', 'people', 'real', 'yet', 'never', 'straying', 'too', 'far', 'creating', 'something', 'overtly', 'awkward', 'worked', 'just', 'right', 'respective', 'roles', 'portrayed', 'terror', 'situation', 'perfectly.It', 'not', 'Jaws', 'not', 'even', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'compared', 'films', 'pretty', 'much', 'off', 'hybrid', 'unfair', 'way', 'compare', 'entirely', 'different', 'animal', 'Just', 'handheld', 'camera', 'sharks', 'water', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'warrant', 'comparisons', 'Still', 'own', 'up', 'deserves', 'be', 'noticed']",N/A

Nothing in this movie was good (well, from a guy's perspective, there was one good part, but I'll leave that unmentioned). In fact, almost everything in this movie reminds me of The Blair Witch Project, except that movie was at least scary for a moment. This movie is just boring, with poor acting that seemed ad-libbed more often than not. And, the character of the lead actors are incongruous; the male character is introduced as impatient, yet it turns out he's the more patient of the two, while the female character is well-educated, yet she uses guess work more often than not.While it's billed as a suspense movie, the most suspenseful moment actually happens early on during a head count, and from there it turns into yet another shark movie. After getting stranded the characters are continually harassed by sharks, and all the while the male lead is spouting off information he saw on Shark Week or on the History Channel.Thankfully, this movie is only a short eighty minutes long, and you can even watch it in fast-forward and still understand everything that happens, as the dialogue in the last forty minutes is mostly drivel.

Anyway, I also don't understand why people are calling this a horror movie.  Yes, it had a few scary moments.  But the plot was about two underwater divers who swim to the surface, only to realize that the boat that dropped them off was no longer there (due to the guy in charge of the boat making a huge mistake and leaving them behind).This movie did exactly what it said it would- two people left out on the sea, and they have to do their best to survive while knowing and understanding the dangers that are always present while in an ocean.  Sharks and jellyfish and all sorts of wild creatures searching for something to eat.  A plotline that spends the entire time showing you how difficult it is to be in that type of situation.Also, as sick as this might sound, the ending of the film was incredibly unpredictable and I actually liked it.

Simmons,"[2, 3]","Title: Open WaterReleased: 2004Rated: RRunning Time: 79 minutesDirected by: Chris KentisStarring: Blanchard Ryan as Susan WatkinsDaniel Travis as Daniel KintnerWhen I first heard about this movie I was left with the impression that it was the ""Blair Witch Project"" on water, a cheaply made independent film that was able to succeed because of its storyline and the film makers ability to hold the audiences interest during the course of its rather short runtime.  Boy was I suprised.  This little gem turned out to be one of the best films I've seen in quite a while, and although it was made for less than $200,000.00, I never once felt like I was watching a low budget picture.  This star of the Sundance Festival went on to make over $30,000,000.00 at the box office.The film chronicles the nightmare scenario of a young couple that are accidentaly left behind while on a scuba diving excursion to a tropical reef during their vacation.  The story was inspired by true events.  What is so remarkable (and refreshing) about this film is the fact that all of the shark footage is real.  The two actors were actually filmed in the water with several wild sharks swimming around (and under) them.  There are no CGI effects in the picture.  The actors are relative unknowns who both give good performances using a decent script.  Had this been a big budget box office production, the studio responsible would no doubt have cast two big name actors and butchered the film with CGI sharks and other needless effects (I doubt any big name actor would have been allowed to get into the open ocean with real live sharks-the insurance companies would have had a fit).  As it is, this film is very well done.When they first realize that they've been left behind, the two characters react with alarm that is quickly replaced by a nonchalant calm in the realization that their absence will be noted and they will be rescued in due time.  But as they begin to drift with the current and the hours drag on, they become more frightened and their stress leads to irritation with each other.  The irritation is soon replaced by fear as sharks begin to investigate what is bobbing about the roof of their world.  You can't help putting yourself in the place of the characters and wondering how you would react to being set adrift in the water with sharks all around you and the uncertainty of knowing if or when you'll be rescued.  Will the couple be rescued in time?  Will their relationship survive the strain of their misadventure?  Or will the sharks win out in the end?I was completely enthralled by this movie.  It was shot with digital cameras by a very small crew off of the Bahama's.  For most of the last hour of the film, the story focuses completely on the two actors bobbing about in the water.  To have done this and still be able to keep the audience rivetted to the screen is testimony to the ability of the cast and crew to create a masterpiece with a minimal budget.  It also shows that great movies can still be made without annoying CGI effects.The DVD itself has several extras, including a making of featurette with the director, who also co-wrote and produced the film with his wife.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great film.  This is ""Jaws"" for the audience of today, an engrossing,terrifying adventure on the open seas.",4,Open Water  (2004),1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,3352,"['Title', 'Open', 'WaterReleased', '2004Rated', 'RRunning', 'Time', '79', 'minutesDirected', 'Chris', 'KentisStarring', 'Blanchard', 'Ryan', 'Susan', 'WatkinsDaniel', 'Travis', 'Daniel', 'KintnerWhen', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'left', 'impression', 'was', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'water', 'cheaply', 'made', 'independent', 'film', 'was', 'able', 'succeed', 'storyline', 'film', 'makers', 'ability', 'hold', 'audiences', 'interest', 'course', 'rather', 'short', 'runtime', 'Boy', 'was', 'suprised', 'little', 'gem', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'was', 'made', 'less', '200,000.00', 'never', 'once', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'low', 'budget', 'picture', 'star', 'Sundance', 'Festival', 'went', 'make', 'over', '30,000,000.00', 'box', 'office.The', 'film', 'nightmare', 'scenario', 'young', 'couple', 'are', 'accidentaly', 'left', 'behind', 'scuba', 'diving', 'excursion', 'tropical', 'reef', 'vacation', 'story', 'was', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'What', 'so', 'remarkable', 'refreshing', 'film', 'fact', 'shark', 'footage', 'real', 'two', 'actors', 'were', 'actually', 'filmed', 'water', 'several', 'wild', 'sharks', 'swimming', 'around', 'are', 'CGI', 'effects', 'picture', 'actors', 'are', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'who', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'using', 'decent', 'script', 'Had', 'been', 'big', 'budget', 'box', 'office', 'production', 'studio', 'responsible', 'would', 'no', 'doubt', 'have', 'cast', 'two', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'butchered', 'film', 'CGI', 'sharks', 'other', 'needless', 'effects', 'doubt', 'big', 'name', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'get', 'open', 'ocean', 'real', 'live', 'sharks-the', 'insurance', 'companies', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'fit', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'first', 'realize', ""'ve"", 'been', 'left', 'two', 'characters', 'react', 'alarm', 'quickly', 'replaced', 'nonchalant', 'calm', 'realization', 'absence', 'will', 'be', 'noted', 'will', 'be', 'rescued', 'due', 'time', 'begin', 'drift', 'current', 'hours', 'drag', 'become', 'more', 'frightened', 'stress', 'irritation', 'other', 'irritation', 'soon', 'replaced', 'fear', 'sharks', 'begin', 'investigate', 'what', 'bobbing', 'roof', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'putting', 'place', 'characters', 'wondering', 'how', 'would', 'react', 'being', 'set', 'adrift', 'water', 'sharks', 'uncertainty', 'knowing', 'when', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rescued', 'Will', 'couple', 'be', 'rescued', 'time', 'Will', 'relationship', 'survive', 'strain', 'misadventure', 'will', 'sharks', 'win', 'out', 'end', 'was', 'completely', 'enthralled', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'digital', 'cameras', 'very', 'small', 'crew', 'Bahama', 'most', 'last', 'hour', 'film', 'story', 'completely', 'two', 'actors', 'bobbing', 'water', 'have', 'done', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'audience', 'rivetted', 'screen', 'testimony', 'ability', 'cast', 'crew', 'create', 'masterpiece', 'minimal', 'budget', 'also', 'great', 'movies', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'made', 'annoying', 'CGI', 'effects.The', 'DVD', 'several', 'extras', 'including', 'making', 'featurette', 'director', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'produced', 'film', 'wife', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'looking', 'great', 'film', 'Jaws', 'audience', 'today', 'engrossing', 'terrifying', 'adventure', 'open', 'seas']",N/A

858803,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00064AE0G,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[14, 20]","So what's up with this film? It received incredible hype at the Sundance Film Festival (and others) and was eventually picked up by Lion's Gate Entertainment for release to a more wide audience. Impressive. Especially for a film shot with a digital camera, and the entire cost of production being picked up by a husband and wife team.As far as production goes, I've got no complaints. The fact that it WAS filmed on a low budget and by one family fills me with respect for this effort. Congratulations to Mr. Chris Kentis and his lovely wife. You've done a great job filming and editing it.But . . .Who were these people? And what I mean by that is, well . . . who were they! Okay. Okay. Let me explain. I just finished watching the film, but I have no idea WHO the husband and wife portrayed in the movie are! Are they near divorce? Why don't they have sex in their room when they're both naked and the husband starts making advances? Why does the wife turn him away, and why does he turn away from her? Has the wife had a miscarriage or something? Was there a recent infidelity by one of them?I'll explain the problem in three simple words: needed character development.The film is only 81 minutes long, so there was room for at least a few minutes of character development (in the beginning or even in flashbacks when they're left out on the sea). Cost must have been an issue (I mean, a low budget film taken on by two people surely must have had time constraints and budgetary concerns), but from a viewer perspective, the story felt too hollow. Again, let me explain.This film is based on a true story about two divers (a husband and wife) who were left out near the Great Barrier Reef in Australia (although this version of the story doesn't take place there) during an excursion on a group boating tour. Their bodies were never found (read Bill Bryson's ""In A Sunburned Country"" for a nice little recounting of the disaster). In the ""real story"" there were assumptions of suicide by the husband and marital problems. Something that could've been developed nicely in a film such as this. But no. Here we're left to guess about the relationship and its dynamics. The only glimpse into these poor saps lives that the filmmakers give us is that they're both very busy people with little time for each other (DUH! That accounts for about 85% of relationships out there!).So when ""bad things"" began happening to them - Jellyfish stings, sharks nibbling on `em - I had absolutely no empathy.

By comparison, Daniel Travis' lackluster portrayal of the whitebread, dull, passive husband is a triumph.You can imagine the plot.

This movie is based on a true story of two divers who went on a scuba excursion in Australia and were accidentally left behind by the crew of the boat, never to be seen or heard from again.What makes this movie different from others is the way it was filmed. It doesn't have any big name Hollywood stars and it doesn't use any expensive production. There are few sound effects and no soundtrack of popular hit songs. Because of this, the movie will seem very strange at first. Even during the suspenseful moments, there is little background noise or sound to build up the tension. It remains mostly quiet, allowing viewers to see and hear only the two people stranded in the water and the natural sounds around them.The way this movie is filmed and directed, you feel like you're watching a home video with no one aware they are being filmed. It's like an episode of Candid Camera. Everyone acts like ordinary people, with no real attempt to ""act"" in the usual sense. For this and other reasons, most people will either love or hate this movie. Those who appreciate the originality and who have more active imaginations will love it. Those who prefer greater production, well- known Hollywood stars, and more drama will hate it.My feelings on this movie are mixed. It's not quite as thrilling as I like, even though it does contain some suspenseful moments. The ending is a little different, too, and once again some will like it a lot and others will hate it for not being more intense.Overall, this is a decent movie and the director Chris Kentis deserves some credit for making a motion picture using nothing but hand- held digital cameras and a budget so tiny it wouldn't have covered the cost of the first ten minutes of most modern- day movies.

Lou""","[5, 7]","This movie was all the more remarkable as it was shot on video with a single camera and a crew of essentially only four persons over a period encompassing two years. Chris Kentis and Laura Lau are to be commended for their outstanding achievement in Independent Film. They showed their original video at a film festival where it attracted the attention of Lions Gate Films who picked it up and did the work necessary (with Kentis and Lau) to color correct and transfer the project to 35mm film for its very successful theatrical release.It was based on a true story about an American couple who were left behind by a dive boat on the Australian Great Barrier Reef. I was in Sydney at the time and was horrified to read that the couple was missing for three days before the dive boat crew even noticed. ( Their bags were left on the boat and the driver from their hotel even asked where they were.) The dive boat actually returned to the same location the next day and found two weight belts on the bottom and still didn't make the connection.The Captain was later tried and acquitted for negligence. The incident sent shock waves throughout the sport diving industry.Months later some of their gear and a cryptic message begging for help was was later found washed up on shore.I know that these kinds of things can happen as I have occasionally picked up panic stricken divers left behind by other dive charter boats.The actors, Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis did a fine job over the course of the two year project that was shot in the Bahamas. They were forced to use real sharks as they could not afford a fake ones. For this alone they get an ""A"" for style and determination.The script was written by Kentis and resulted in a taught 80 minute film that was truly horrifying and suspenseful. As a diver it made me squirm and cringe and left me disturbed for days after seeing the film. There can be few fates worse than being abandoned at sea.This film is a triumph for Indie filmmakers who showed what can be done with a few people and a lot of imagination. This is a classic tale of the sea and a must have, especially if one is a diver.This one is two thumbs up all the way.The Wreck Hunters: Dive to the Wreck of the USS Bass",5,Real Terror on the Water,1115424000,"05 7, 2005",2005,2233,"['movie', 'was', 'more', 'remarkable', 'was', 'shot', 'video', 'single', 'camera', 'crew', 'essentially', 'only', 'four', 'persons', 'period', 'encompassing', 'two', 'years', 'Chris', 'Kentis', 'Laura', 'Lau', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'outstanding', 'achievement', 'Independent', 'Film', 'showed', 'original', 'video', 'film', 'festival', 'where', 'attracted', 'attention', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'Films', 'who', 'picked', 'up', 'did', 'work', 'necessary', 'Kentis', 'Lau', 'color', 'correct', 'transfer', 'project', '35mm', 'film', 'very', 'successful', 'theatrical', 'release.It', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'American', 'couple', 'who', 'were', 'left', 'behind', 'dive', 'boat', 'Australian', 'Great', 'Barrier', 'Reef', 'was', 'Sydney', 'time', 'was', 'horrified', 'read', 'couple', 'was', 'missing', 'three', 'days', 'dive', 'boat', 'crew', 'even', 'noticed', 'bags', 'were', 'left', 'boat', 'driver', 'hotel', 'even', 'asked', 'where', 'were', 'dive', 'boat', 'actually', 'returned', 'same', 'location', 'next', 'day', 'found', 'two', 'weight', 'belts', 'bottom', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'connection.The', 'Captain', 'was', 'later', 'tried', 'acquitted', 'negligence', 'incident', 'sent', 'shock', 'waves', 'sport', 'diving', 'industry.Months', 'later', 'gear', 'cryptic', 'message', 'begging', 'help', 'was', 'was', 'later', 'found', 'washed', 'up', 'shore.I', 'know', 'kinds', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'have', 'occasionally', 'picked', 'up', 'panic', 'stricken', 'divers', 'left', 'behind', 'other', 'dive', 'charter', 'boats.The', 'actors', 'Blanchard', 'Ryan', 'Daniel', 'Travis', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'course', 'two', 'year', 'project', 'was', 'shot', 'Bahamas', 'were', 'forced', 'use', 'real', 'sharks', 'could', 'not', 'afford', 'fake', 'ones', 'alone', 'get', 'A', 'style', 'determination.The', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'Kentis', 'resulted', 'taught', '80', 'minute', 'film', 'was', 'truly', 'horrifying', 'suspenseful', 'diver', 'made', 'squirm', 'cringe', 'left', 'disturbed', 'days', 'seeing', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'few', 'fates', 'worse', 'being', 'abandoned', 'sea.This', 'film', 'triumph', 'Indie', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'showed', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'few', 'people', 'lot', 'imagination', 'classic', 'tale', 'sea', 'must', 'have', 'especially', 'one', 'diver.This', 'one', 'two', 'thumbs', 'way.The', 'Wreck', 'Hunters', 'Dive', 'Wreck', 'USS', 'Bass']",N/A

That is all it took to make OPEN WATER a riveting success on a limited budget back in 2003. Movie-goers expecting to find the next JAWS may have been sorely disappointed, but those seeking true terror in a real-world setting found it here. Susan and Daniel take off to the Caribbean for an island getaway, but their dream vacation soon becomes a nightmare when they are left stranded in the middle of the ocean during a scuba diving lesson. As panic, dehydration, and fatigue begin to set in, the couple soon comes face to face with many other dangers as they struggle to survive. Many cite the uneventfulness of the plot as a critical flaw, when it has actually has quite the opposite effect. The characters are left to dissect the situation, to pass through the various stages of denial, anger, and depression as they await their fate. Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis hit a few rough patches in their acting, but overall their honest performances show heart-felt emotion and clear character progressions. While the two are eventually swarmed by sharks, the helpless feelings of being lost at sea and not knowing what might be hiding beneath the surface prevail over the gruesome attacks. There are still a number of jarring moments where the long strings of dialog are broken up by the sudden thrashing of a shark's tail just inches away from the characters. Chris Kentis' use of digital filming also creates a documentary-like look and feel that draws the viewer into the reality of the situation.

Well, in Open Water, we find out what two people in just that situation might do. The film is starkly realistic and haunting in its depiction of this crisis, and plunges to depths you wouldn't expect in a horror film.Left behind on a scuba diving trip out in the ocean due to a miscount on the boat, the young couple Daniel (Daniel Travis) and Susan (Blanchard Ryan) find themselves in disbelief that they have actually been left out in the ocean. They were here on vacation after all, and worse yet, they were paying for this! At first they try to rationalize their situation, and tell themselves that of course the boat was coming back to get them. But after a few hours, they start to realize that maybe it isn't, and then they begin to wonder what exactly is going to happen. They're too far from land, and the current is carrying them wherever it pleases, and, oh yeah, there are an increasing number of sharks swirling around in the water beneath them.Open Water is the brainchild of writer-director Chris Kentis and his producer wife Laura Lau, who filmed it using digital video and unknown actors on a minimal budget over two and a half years. When you see the two actors swimming out there in the water, those are real live sharks swimming out there with them, which only adds to the tension that is created.Kentis's choice of digital video lends the film a documentary-type feel, which is perfect, because a film such as this is better suited using a realistic style, which makes it seem all the more plausible. The actors do a fine job, in that they act exactly as I could see myself acting in the same situation, and I came away from the film thanking the heavens that I have not been, and hopefully never will be.

For whatever reason, Open Water was one that you hear enough about and go ""well ok I'll give it a shot"". Imagine my surprise where I'm staring at the screen. I wasn't scared to the point where I couldn't move, but rather I was wondering what the big fuss was about. Shot independently in a documentary-like feel with real sharks, you get the feeling this could've been great but as it stands it's one of those huge missed opportunities.Daniel and Susan are a married couple with a less-than-stellar marriage as of late. Going on a quickly scheduled vacation in the Caribbean, the pair go scuba diving but because of an error involving a head count, they get stranded out at sea. With the current taking them who knows where, the couple have to figure out how to get home. Of course that's the least of the problems as every now and then, something brushes past their leg and they see what looks like a shark fin in the waves.The film starts so slowly and so innocent, you can practically show the movie to someone without saying the word ""shark"" or letting them see the cover art and they'd bet that this was a vacation video shot by tourists. Then the film shifts gears and we basically just watch 2 people in an ocean floating, crying and yelling at each other sometimes. While being stranded out at sea with man-eating sharks is a bad situation to be in, the way it's presented just didn't unnerve me. Is it because we don't care about the characters? Doubt it since we rarely leave them, allowing us plenty of opportunity to bond yet they never develop into people we want saving, we're just wondering when's the next shark appearance coming.The other flaw comes from the acting itself. The 2 main leads should be making these characters fleshed out but they never seem to nail who these characters are and make them empathize with them (although and this is just a total guy thing: the nude scene reveals a fantastic body). One thing that is surprising though is the photography of the film. There's some scenes with gorgeous waves and beaches and one scene involving a thunderstorm is just cool and also one of the few instances in the film where it gets anything remotely close to being thrilling.Should you rent?

If you need Saw or good old Jaws like theatre you miss the boat here.Based on a true story of a couple that go scuba diving off a tour boat with 18 other people & get left in the ocean. A miscount takes place due to a vacationer entering the water late. There is no hero, no uplifting spirit & no happy ending. It is bleak. When my wife & I came out of this show everyone was in a stunned state of mind. Many were angry & vocal about it. Not that they had been ripped off but rather that the movie left you emotionally spent & distraught. My wife was so mad at how upset she got she was cussing like a sailor. Not a normal activity for her. There is more than just one bad decision in this show.I am aware there are a number of bad reviews for this show but people seem to think it was supposed to be a fun, scary & tense kinda show you know like ""Dude there is going to be sharks eating people"". To them I say what did you think a movie about people abandoned in the ocean would be like? There is no barracuda battles, no octopuses to eat, no heroic staving off of a shark attack. This couple didn't get to go back to the beach & treat their jelly fish stings. Did you expect for them to go skinny dipping for your enjoyment. Floating in the water till the end is all they had. It's either being picked up or die. The interminable waiting for an almost certain death was exactly what these two humans lived & died through. You were put through it as they were. Based on a real story remember?All of the people I know that saw this movie knew before hand that it was a true story made to highlight the loss of two family members & the lack of regulations governing this activity. I guess there wasn't enough action & blood for some to understand the heartbreak of the living family members. Blanchard Ryan & Daniel Travis took a movie that was tedious work & made a good job of showing the very real actions & emotions these two must have gone through. The bodies maybe were never found but the camera with their vacation pictures was taken out of a shark's belly.

Unfortunately it's camcorder quality played like a low budget offering, not exactly being riveting.The young couple both in high stress professions, desperately book a relaxing Caribbean vacatiuon.  They plan to join a diving charter.  They inexplicably get left behind due to a head counting error by the charter boat crew.  They are marooned in the open ocean and decide to remain in place hoping for rescue, rather than swimming to some boats in close proximity.  This bad decision soon leads to hunger, hypothermia and harrassment by sharks.  It's not till the following day that the charter crew realizes that they're missing.This inane movie supposedly based on a true story is incomprehensible.  A simple head count would have determined their absence.  The dialogue between the couple was sophomoric at best and there was an amateurish quality to the acting.

They got the most mileage they could out of their resources, and yet retained believability and fear via a gamut of human emotions displayed in the main characters.

858830,A51IK68MWKV5R,B00064AE0G,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[5, 6]","When an annoying yuppie couple go on a scuba vacation, a careless mistake on the part of the boat crew finds the duo left behind, stranded in shark-infested waters in the middle of the ocean. For a relationship that was tense to begin with, this leads to alternating levels of blame and interdependence.For me, Open Water was the must-see movie of the summer of 2004. I wasn't expecting perfection from this little indie flick (from the writer-director/producer husband-and-wife team behind Grind, Chris Kentis and Laura Lau), but I did think I would get to see a tight little thriller with some good fright scenes.Unfortunately, Open Water does not deliver on its promise of scares. There are tense moments, to be sure -- especially once the sharks come in for a taste -- but neither I nor the person I was with ever felt any real terror.Nevertheless, the writing and directing are solid -- a real feat given that Kentis and Lau also acted as cinematographers. The acting of the two leads carries Open Water, though. I especially liked how Blanchard Ryan (Susan) underplayed her scenes, letting her eyes show her feelings -- particularly during the courageous finale. Her screenmate, Daniel Travis, prefers to act with his voice, which makes him less effective during the tense sequences as his voice rises into frantic registers unnecessary to get the point across.From a fright standpoint, I was disappointed, but on the whole, Open Water is a solid portrait of human misadventure. An independent film with blockbuster ambitions, there are many things about it to admire, not least of which is the fact (as explained in the DVD extras) that it was filmed on weekends over a long period of time -- while Kentis was holding down a full-time job. Kentis and Lau (each taking on at least two jobs on the film -- Kentis was also the editor) have taken digital video, really the only way to make movies these days on the cheap (also, the fewer sets, the better, as this shows), and made a surprisingly beautiful-looking film that doesn't show its origins as much as some others and that will hopefully act as a springboard for better things to come as well as inspiring future filmmakers.",4,"Not scary, but good",1107734400,"02 7, 2005",2005,2185,"['When', 'annoying', 'yuppie', 'couple', 'go', 'scuba', 'vacation', 'careless', 'mistake', 'part', 'boat', 'crew', 'duo', 'left', 'behind', 'stranded', 'shark-infested', 'waters', 'middle', 'ocean', 'relationship', 'was', 'tense', 'begin', 'alternating', 'levels', 'blame', 'interdependence.For', 'Open', 'Water', 'was', 'must-see', 'movie', 'summer', '2004', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'perfection', 'little', 'indie', 'flick', 'writer-director/producer', 'husband-and-wife', 'team', 'Grind', 'Chris', 'Kentis', 'Laura', 'Lau', 'did', 'think', 'would', 'get', 'see', 'tight', 'little', 'thriller', 'good', 'fright', 'scenes.Unfortunately', 'Open', 'Water', 'not', 'deliver', 'promise', 'scares', 'are', 'tense', 'moments', 'be', 'sure', 'especially', 'sharks', 'come', 'taste', 'person', 'was', 'ever', 'felt', 'real', 'terror.Nevertheless', 'writing', 'directing', 'are', 'solid', 'real', 'feat', 'given', 'Kentis', 'Lau', 'also', 'acted', 'cinematographers', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'Open', 'Water', 'especially', 'liked', 'how', 'Blanchard', 'Ryan', 'Susan', 'underplayed', 'scenes', 'letting', 'eyes', 'show', 'feelings', 'particularly', 'courageous', 'finale', 'screenmate', 'Daniel', 'Travis', 'prefers', 'act', 'voice', 'less', 'effective', 'tense', 'sequences', 'voice', 'frantic', 'registers', 'unnecessary', 'get', 'point', 'fright', 'standpoint', 'was', 'disappointed', 'whole', 'Open', 'Water', 'solid', 'portrait', 'human', 'misadventure', 'independent', 'film', 'blockbuster', 'ambitions', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'admire', 'not', 'least', 'fact', 'explained', 'DVD', 'extras', 'was', 'filmed', 'weekends', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'Kentis', 'was', 'holding', 'down', 'full-time', 'job', 'Kentis', 'Lau', 'taking', 'least', 'two', 'jobs', 'film', 'Kentis', 'was', 'also', 'editor', 'have', 'taken', 'digital', 'video', 'really', 'only', 'way', 'make', 'movies', 'days', 'cheap', 'also', 'fewer', 'sets', 'better', 'made', 'surprisingly', 'beautiful-looking', 'film', ""n't"", 'show', 'origins', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'will', 'hopefully', 'act', 'springboard', 'better', 'things', 'come', 'as', 'well', 'inspiring', 'future', 'filmmakers']",N/A

The other is the psychologically scary. (Some movies do have elements of both, though.) After reading the one star reviews, it&#8217;s apparent that those who hated this movie expected/wanted a blood and gore and screaming movie. Most also seemed to expect the kind of big budget extravaganza that Hollywood usually serves up. That&#8217;s not this film. They also seemed to miss what elements made it scary to positive reviewers.I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a spoiler to map out the basic premise:  scuba divers are forgotten and left behind at sea and must brave the natural environment to survive. So why does it work?1.  This is based on a true story. In fact, it appears people are left behind when scuba diving *all the time.* They&#8217;re usually picked right back up, but not always.2.  The camera views sometime have a jerky feel, which at times made me feel a little nauseated myself. That&#8217;s realism. A character also fights seasickness.3. The movie is all about being left alone in the middle of nowhere, so the film makers create this feeling for the viewers through open views of pure ocean, a lack of fakey Hollywood sound effects, and a lack of a super dramatic musical score. Brief scenes on shore are similarly quiet, both before their crisis and when they&#8217;re cutting to the partying the couple is missing. This contributes to the feeling of isolation from real life.4. Some people have commented on the brief &#8220;naked&#8221; scene, where the couple goes to bed naked. I puzzled over the need for that as well, and finally decided it might have been meant as a foreshadowing of their vulnerability.5. The couple goes through a version of the K&uuml;bler-Ross Stages of Grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance. We see them bicker and try to distract themselves. These are real, normal reactions &#8211; not heroic shark wrangling and unflagging optimism some expected.Don&#8217;t get me wrong; I also love a big budget, big sound, action thriller.

In the movie it's quite different, although I won't give away the ending.*SPOILERS*Overall, the ending ruined the entire movie for me.  It was disturbing and not at all expected nor wanted.  In fact, when the character ""Daniel"" died, I didn't believe it.  I kept thinking, ""She let him go?!  No...he'll wake up, he's just unconsious.  Or the helicopters will see them and save them both!  No, he's not dead...""Then I saw him get eaten by the shark...Then there was ""Suzan"" who we watch while she swims around, alone, except for the multitude of sharks swarming about her.  I thought that okay, Daniel is dead, but Suzan will survive.  But nope, we watch her pretty much kill herself....the end.Yup, that's it.  They both die and it's very much disturbing.*END OF SPOILERS*The movie, I thought, was just fine and enjoyable right up until the ending.  At which point I was astonished and suddenly did not like the movie anymore.  Some movies just shouldn't end like this, and this movie was one of them.Two stars for keeping me in my chair, but nothing more, the ending completely ruined it.I'm not sure I'd recommend this to anyone.  It's just a very ""blah"" movie.  I could have definitely lived without seeing this.

858838,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B00064AE0G,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[6, 8]","About a quarter of the way into ""Open Water"", yuppy-in-peril Susan (Blanchard Ryan), floating like one big unhappy cork in a shark-infested corner of the Pacific, whimpers of their new shark buddies ""I don't know which is worse---seeing them or not seeing them.""I'm going to pick ""not seeing Them"" as the greater of two evils. Ignorance, in Chris Kentis's wickedly bleak nugget of grue, is not bliss.It's Death.Filmed on a shoestring budget (130,000 bones, I'm told) and shot on high-end digital, ""Open Water"" films like a documentary: a camera follows the Caribbean vacation of two stressed-out yuppies-in-love (or something like it), chronicles their much needed jaunt to the Bahamas, follows them out on a dive-boat for a little underwater spelunking, captures their surprise when, surfacing 30 minutes later, they find the dive boat gone---and, with rare exceptions (and only then to rub salt, heh heh, in the wound), never leaves their side throughout the ordeal that follows.Let's get the basics out of the way: for all the budget constraints, ""Open Water"" looks great. Digital video (used in another horror classic ""Session 9"") has a way of leeching the colors out of scenery, but in this case it's fine: it gives ""Open Water"" the feel of a well-executed home video---""Blair Witch"" without motion sickness---and makes the flick more accessible.There are some slick, deft little cinematic touches, as when the camera slips down beneath the surface of the water for a few teasing shots of dorsal fins and dead black eyes slicing through the gloom.The acting is equally makeshift---not great, but---again---given the flick's budget, it gets the job done. Blanchard Ryan (Susan) and Daniel Travis (Daniel) do what they have to do as work-obsessed stressed-out yuppies, the kind usually yapping on their cell phones in movie theaters. They yap into their cell-phones, they coordinate their clothes well, they decompress, they scr*w, they worry about the clock again, they insert themselves into the great global food chain without a second thought (because, man, you know---even if you're in paradise, you've got to be doing something, right?), they bicker, and---well, you'll see.Once Susan and Daniel pop up in an empty ocean, they're surprised, a little astounded, slightly worried. But only slightly. Things like this don't happen to upwardly mobile techno-hipsters, right? So they sink back into their life jackets, tell a few jokes, wait for help to arrive.What that means is that ""Open Water"" becomes a waiting game to see which happens first: either 1) the diveboat crew realizes their mistake, and dispatches rescuers to save our unhappy duo; 2) the increasingly interested grey reef sharks circling the two decide to throw reserve to the wind and take a hearty chunk of a little human au vin, nicely simmered in a little saltwater vinaigrette.There are two reasons why I dig---and very much appreciate---Kentis's little sea dog of a horror-show.First: Kentis makes some very subtle points about just how much effort it takes to create and maintain the world in which our two happy, clueless yuppies---proxies for ourselves---flounder about.There's a juicy little sequence that takes all of two seconds: you see a coconut poised on a tabletop, seconds before a machete slices down through it with massive, startling force, slicing off the coconut's top. An instant later, the coconut seller passes two sliced coconuts to Susan and Daniel, who proceed to insert---delicately, comically---two little straws, and commence sipping.The point I'm getting at is this: in mastering our environment through technology, we have insulated ourselves from the very Nature our ancestors fought with, bled against, died before. Even the most stringently vegan among us does his hunting and gathering and growing in grocery stores. The stalking and skinning, the sowing and reaping, have all been done for us, by people we do not see, by efforts we do not fathom.Do we not take a massive gamble, then, in inserting our foolish selves back into that bloodthirsty food-chain?The second thing I dig about ""Open Water"" is its cold-blooded nihilism. Both ""Jaws"" and ""Deep Blue Sea"" are both, at heart, movies about Good and Evil doing battle. ""Open Water"" dispenses with such niceties. You see that gorgeous, rippling expanse of ocean? There are monsters gliding beneath the surface, there are things with Teeth, and they want to rip open your flesh and drink your blood devour you screaming.That is the world, and the world is full of Hungry Things. Hungry Things that don't care about your high-tone zip code, or the make and model of your hip new cell-phone; Hungry Things that make no distinction between wrinkled peasant pearl-fisher and gym-hardened urban hipster. Hungry Things that don't really care whether you've got your credit together, or got a killer portfolio, or two BMWs parked in the garage of your three-story townhouse.Call on God, your Lawyer, or even your Broker: in the end, beneath the Moon and under the stars, adrift on the Open Water, caught without water in the high Desert, dying of hunger in some lonely Alpine pass---the only Truth is Appetite. The only Law is Force. And the only Exit is Death.JSG",5,Reality Bites,1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,5219,"['quarter', 'way', 'Open', 'Water', 'yuppy-in-peril', 'Susan', 'Blanchard', 'Ryan', 'floating', 'one', 'big',

The tension boils slowly, after a bright, carefree start, as the two main characters, Daniel and Susan (two relatively unknowns before this movie) decide to go scuba diving. They are left behind and are left out in the 'open water.'The horror is what you don't see rather than what you do see. All you get are brief glimpses of sharks beneath the surface of the water which gives for a more impact effect.The story mirrors the true case of Eileen and Tom Lonergan, though there is no proof that they were attacked by sharks.Your heart sinks as the scuba boat fades into the distance leaving Daniel and Susan bobbing up and down in the beautiful blue water (which gives a false sense to the dangers below).The tension in the water is subtle and builds up to an ending that is surprising. The suspense is breathtaking.

858843,A24SC3EXWOIK2P,B00064AE0G,"Dead Kev ""Zombie Advocate""","[4, 6]","The nightmare that one can only imagine in their mind becomes reality for a vacationing couple on an island getaway in OPEN WATER. Daniel (Daniel Travis) and Susan (Blanchard Ryan) lead hectic lives and desperately need a vacation. Their vacation goes awry (sounds a lot like my vacations) while open-water scuba diving. After frolicking with all the underwater sea creatures, their fun abruptly ends when they surface to find that their guide boat has left them. Why did it leave? Is it coming back? Will they ever make it back to the island? Daniel and Susan are cold, alone, miles from land, and now adrift in shark-infested waters. Their only support now is with each other.OPEN WATER is based loosely on the true events surrounding the disappearance of Thomas and Eileen Lonergan, an American couple who were left behind during a dive off of the Great Barrier Reef in Northern Queensland, Australia in 1998. The error was due to the Lonergans' dive details not being entered into the boat's divemaster's log book and a possible botched head count. Over 48 hours after the couple were left behind, the crew of the Outer Edge realized their error and a search was issued with 17 aircraft, helicopters, and boats. The Lonergans were never found and many rumors of their ultimate fate have surfaced since. Talks of marriage trouble provided the theory that that they committed suicide, or a murder-suicide took place. Another scenario has the Lonergans using the dive boat as part of an elaborate hoax to fake their deaths. Most diving experts, however, believe that they died on the reef. A few weeks after they'd gone missing, some of the couple's personal dive gear washed up on a beach 75 miles from the dive site. Six months later, a weathered dive slate - used to communicate underwater - with contact information for Eileen's father and the words, """"[Mo]nday Jan 26; 1998 08am. To anyone [who] can help us: We have been abandoned on A[gin]court Reef by MV Outer Edge 25 Jan 98 3pm. Please help us [come] to rescue us before we die. Help!!!""While nobody will ever know what truly happened to the Lonergans, OPEN WATER takes a stab at one possible scenario. This is not, however, meant to explain the story of the Lonergans. It is simply a fictional tale based ""loosely"" on their tragic story. The location is left intentionally ambiguous and no characters are based on real people. Shot completely on digital video, OPEN WATER may be a very new experience for many watching it on the big screen. The audio is simply horrendous in parts, and much of it looks like you're watching your in-law's boring vacation video. Though, I think it's akin to watching a film with subtitles. It's a bit distracting at first, but soon you won't even notice it. For a film such as this, combined with the real sharks, it has a much more ""real"" feel to it. It's believable, and for the most part, I was immersed in the story and their dilemma, and could ignore the shaky cam and technical shortcomings.It must also be said that this is not a shark movie, though it's not surprising that many are buying tickets with that in mind, seeing that Lions Gate has marketed it that way. It will end up getting people into the theater, but ultimately may backfire as audiences will feel like they were mislead. The sharks are important to the story, but really, they take a back seat to the third main character of the film, the water itself. The ocean serves as the biggest antagonist in the film. They're stuck in it, they can't drink it, it houses innumerable dangers underneath (including sharks), and they're completely at its mercy. They're going to go where its currents want to take them.I don't think everyone will like OPEN WATER. In fact, some people will hate it. Marketing it as a great shark movie may ultimately annoy audiences after it's all said and done. Whether Lions Gate actually cares or not, who knows. While not a great film, at least it's original and a little different. It does give off a certain amount of uneasiness and helplessness, which at times can have you on the edge of your seat. And afterwards, maybe you won't feel so bad having to go back to your crappy 9 to 5 job everyday.

The beginning was pretty slow, but it was so real.  It felt like you were just watching a home video of their trip.  Once they were in the water, it wasn't scary - it was eerie.  The mistake made was so simple, that it could happen to anyone.  That's the ""scary"" part of it all.  That's it's not some far fetched gore fest with a giant killer shark.  It's a realistic film.I felt that in the ""party"" scenes when they showed what was going on on the island (or, what they could've been doing if they had been there), they could've shown what the tour guides were doing on the island.  That would've been a good contrast instead of showing just random people.At the end of the film, your mind will just be boggled.  This film definitely leaves a print in your mind.

858846,A3MCC5MAJYJYMD,B00064AE0G,Dhaval Vyas,"[3, 9]","Fresh out on DVD is one of the most talked about movies of 2004.  'Open Water' caused a bit of a stir over this last summer because it was based on a true story and was supposed to have some shocking material in it.  The movie stars two unknown actors; Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis star as married couple out on a vacation in the Caribbean Sea.  They go scuba diving in the sea, but then are caught in a most unfortunate situation.  Their boat leaves without taking them; an awful mistake made by the boatman when he counted wrong, making him believe everyone was back on boat.Our two sweethearts are all alone in the sea with no help in sight.  There is no reason to go any further in explaining this movie.  It is rather disappointing because it contains nothing most people haven't seen before.  In fact, what the movie contains is actually worse that what many people have seen before.  In fact, the movie Jaws actually did a much better job of suspense than this movie, and Jaws came out almost thirty years ago!'Open Water' prides itself in using real sharks for the story.  The sharks come really close to the characters and that's just about all we see.  For about forty minutes we are treated to both characters screaming at each other and close-up shots of sharks underwater.  There is actually one really fantastic scene in the movie.  Near the end of the story, when the wife looks underwater, she realizes she is completely surrounding by sharks.  Dozens and dozens of them on all sides.  There you have it folks.  That's just about the best moment in the whole film.It is supposed to be based on a true story, but I'm pretty sure 95 percent of the material was made up by the filmmakers.  When one sees the ending of the movie, one will understand why most of the material was made up.  If one really wants to see this film, then they should go rent it.  It is not that long, clocking in at 81 minutes, so one won't feel they have wasted too much time.  But one should just stay away from Open Water.  Try renting a movie set on a land.

858847,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,B00064AE0G,DonAthos,"[4, 9]","Not every movie has to have a happy ending.The problem with Open Water, a film about two scubadivers on vacation who get left behind in shark-infested waters, is not that it has a tragic ending (though it does; they both die). The problem with Open Water is that the ending is not instructive. There is no hope left to us at the end. No redemption. Their lives didn't mean anything in this film and neither did their deaths. They simply died, and everything else was futile and a foregone conclusion. We come into the movie knowing that they're going to be left behind by the boat. When it happens, we basically are assured that there is no hope for them; no salvation. The rest of the movie is watching them die; waiting for them to die. It is essentially a long snuff film. It is an exercise in nihlistic cinema--nothing in this movie means anything, and everyone winds up in pain, despair and death.Defenders of the film might say, and with some justification, that ""this was based on a true story!--people get left behind in situations just like this and there is no miraculous rescue or 'greater meaning' to it."" Of course, they're right--things like this do happen, and there are rarely any twists... usually, just prolonged death. But the main difference between cinema (and other forms of storytelling) and reality is: in cinema, we can make anything that we want to happen. In cinema, we are not bound by ""what usually happens""--we're in control. And, based on the fact of that control, what we choose to have happen in our movies and stories says something about what we think about life and the world. Whether we like it or not, *every* story has a message, a meaning. And, Open Water's meaning, whatever we specifically determine it to be, is negative. Open Water's meaning has to do with our futility and our uselessness and our pointless suffering. It offers nothing positive, nothing redemptive, nothing hopeful for any of us. It is something of a geekshow--a carney side-attraction that claims to be ""nature"" and ""educational"" but really is just darkness and depravity for their own sakes. This movie is interminably bleak, and you will not walk away from it a better person in any way, shape or manner. You will not walk away happy, or relieved or edified. You will simply walk away.Of course, what I'm talking about is philosophy and has nothing to do with the technical merits of the film. It's not to say that the movie is poorly made, or poorly acted, or anything like that. Many people will find the pacing slow, but I thought that the pacing was just fine for the length of the film (short, about an hour and fifteen minutes). The lead actress is absurdly beautiful. The suspense is good, and the filming remarkably well done considering the shoestring budget they'd had. The movie is well-made and it should hold your interest. The way that they said it is fine, and even good--I just did not care for what they had to say.",2,A Question of Aesthetics **SPOILERS**,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,2947,"['Not', 'movie', 'have', 'happy', 'ending.The', 'problem', 'Open', 'Water', 'film', 'two', 'scubadivers', 'vacation', 'who', 'get', 'left', 'behind', 'shark-infested', 'waters', 'not', 'tragic', 'ending', 'die', 'problem', 'Open', 'Water', 'ending', 'not', 'instructive', 'hope', 'left', 'end', 'redemption', 'lives', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', 'film', 'did', 'deaths', 'simply', 'died', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'futile', 'foregone', 'conclusion', 'come', 'movie', 'knowing', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'left', 'boat', 'When', 'basically', 'are', 'assured', 'hope', 'salvation', 'rest', 'movie', 'watching', 'die', 'waiting', 'die', 'essentially', 'long', 'snuff', 'film', 'exercise', 'nihlistic', 'cinema', 'nothing', 'movie', 'anything', 'everyone', 'up', 'pain', 'despair', 'death.Defenders', 'film', 'might', 'say', 'justification', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'people', 'get', 'left', 'behind', 'situations', 'just', 'miraculous', 'rescue', ""'greater"", 'meaning', 'course', ""'re"", 'right', 'things', 'do', 'happen', 'are', 'rarely', 'twists', 'usually', 'just', 'prolonged', 'death', 'main', 'difference', 'cinema', 'other', 'forms', 'storytelling', 'reality', 'cinema', 'can', 'make', 'anything', 'want', 'happen', 'cinema', 'are', 'not', 'bound', 'what', 'usually', ""'re"", 'control', 'based', 'fact', 'control', 'what', 'choose', 'have', 'happen', 'movies', 'stories', 'something', 'what', 'think', 'life', 'world', 'like', 'not', '*every*', 'story', 'message', 'meaning', 'Open', 'Water', 'meaning', 'specifically', 'determine', 'be', 'negative', 'Open', 'Water', 'meaning', 'do', 'futility', 'uselessness', 'pointless', 'suffering', 'nothing', 'positive', 'nothing', 'redemptive', 'nothing', 'hopeful', 'something', 'geekshow', 'carney', 'side-attraction', 'be', 'nature', 'educational', 'really', 'just', 'darkness', 'depravity', 'own', 'sakes', 'movie', 'interminably', 'bleak', 'will', 'not', 'walk', 'away', 'better', 'person', 'way', 'shape', 'manner', 'will', 'not', 'walk', 'away', 'happy', 'relieved', 'edified', 'will', 'simply', 'walk', 'away.Of', 'course', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'philosophy', 'nothing', 'do', 'technical', 'merits', 'film', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'poorly', 'made', 'poorly', 'acted', 'anything', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'pacing', 'slow', 'thought', 'pacing', 'was', 'just', 'fine', 'length', 'film', 'short', 'hour', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'lead', 'actress', 'absurdly', 'beautiful', 'suspense', 'good', 'filming', 'remarkably', 'well', 'done', 'considering', 'shoestring', 'budget', ""'d"", 'had', 'movie', 'well-made', 'should', 'hold', 'interest', 'way', 'said', 'fine', 'even', 'good', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'what', 'had', 'say']",N/A

858851,AZFOXFBLZ63UA,B00064AE0G,D. Webster,"[2, 4]","I really wanted to enjoy this movie, perhaps considering Jaws quality the potential. When I saw this in the theater, I kept on waiting to be intrigued or thrilled .... but nothing happened. I considered walking out, and subsequently regretted not having done so. But, I immediately drew a comparison to the Blair Witch Project, which seemed similarly vacuous.The possibility that people may be set adrift in the big blue is very real, and the possiblity that the men in the grey suits may become curious is also real. But nothing happens, except for the fact that these two pathetic drifers became whimpering suicides. Anyone with half a brain would have noticed the large navigational buoy clanging next to them, floated over, climbed up, dried off, and waited for an inevitable boat destined to use said nav. aid. They might have had to endure a little sunburn, thirst and hunger before rescue .... the horror.Poorly written and conceived, I give this movie two stars because it takes place on the water. Quint's (Robert Shaw's) Indianapolis monologue from Jaws stands as one of the finest moments in cinema, creating a chilling picture of a terrible shark scenario. Too bad this didn't measure up.But,you know ... more than a few people find something in this movie. I'm really not crazy about ""reviewers"" who run around attaching poor ratings onto movies. Most of them are probably chronic complainers anyway, and here I am rubbing elbows with the worst of them. I would often like to review the reviewers, if the truth be told.

858854,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B00064AE0G,Elisabeth,"[2, 2]","What makes this movie so successful is the ability to capture how vulnerable one feels while in the ocean.  In the ocean, there are no walls to lean on for support and nothing at all to protect you from the creatures that lie underneath.  And unless you keep looking underwater, you don't know what's coming at you until it's too late.That's what this couple, stranded in the middle of the ocean, have to deal with.  The female lead is immediately scared about the dangerous situation they're in while the male lead puts on a brave face trying to protect her...but really, he can't protect her anymore than he can protect himself.As time wears on, though, both people struggle with their feelings of helplessness.  They bicker and blame each other, but then cling to each to form a protective barrier against the sharks.You hardly see the sharks in this movie (a tactic that made Jaws successful, too).  You might see a fin, or multiple fins, pop up onto the surface, but you don't really see them until the very end.  And the end is memorable and disturbingly realistic.  Actually, the whole movie is disturbingly realistic, making you feel as if this could happen to you, too.My only complaint about the movie is that once the movie ends, the scenery becomes cheerful.

858857,AYUUO2GCLMY29,B00064AE0G,estelita rodriguez,"[8, 9]","After reading other reviews you get a sense that this is filmed in the ""blair witch project"" style but I realized there is a reason why it was done this way. The characters did not become too real, I did not get to know either one of them too much, I just knew of them. And I want to thank the director for that or whoever is responsible because I fully expected them to survive and when they don't, I'm horrified. If that movie had been filmed in any other way where I got to know the characters more in depth, I would be traumatized. I liked the way it was done. But this is a horror film.  From CDNN Article: The promotional material boasts that the film is ""based on true events"", but its makers are now parrying questions about exactly which true events are involved. Yet few doubt that the inspiration is the case of Tom and Eileen Lonergan, American tourists who disappeared off Australia's Great Barrier Reef on January 25, 1998. The couple had wound up in Australia after several years of travelling round the world. They had met and married at Louisiana State University, where Eileen had taken up scuba diving and persuaded Tom to join in her hobby. For two years they had taught for the Peace Corps in the Pacific island country of Tuvalu, before spending a further year in Fiji.They were planning to travel round the world before heading home, but first the couple were determined to visit the Barrier Reef. In Port Douglas, an upmarket diving and sailing town towards the end of the road north through Queensland, they decided to take a day trip on a 26-passenger boat, the Outer Edge. For A$160, the five crew would take them for three dives on the ribbon reefs, a stack of broad shoals that run along the seaward ramparts of the Barrier Reef, 40 miles offshore. On their third dive, round about 3pm, they headed off together and were last spotted swimming calmly 12m down. When they came to the surface after less than an hour underwater, the Outer Edge had gone.Being left behind on a dive is not an instant death sentence. Paul Lucas, a tourist from Leicester with less than 10 dives under his belt, survived for 40 hours in stormy seas in January 2000, after he was left behind by a dive boat in northern New South Wales. A diver is wearing an inflatable lifejacket and has the air to inflate it in a tank strapped to their back. The danger in the blazing heat of tropical Queensland is that, without fresh water, someone floating in the middle of the ocean may dehydrate long before help can arrive.The day after the incident the Outer Edge brought another tour party to the area, and one diver found six dive weights resting on the bottom. Oblivious to what had happened the previous day, a crew member described the find as a bonus.At that point Tom and Eileen might still have been alive just a few miles away, using the empty dive belt to bind themselves together. They certainly appear to have survived the night: several months later a fisherman 100 miles north of the site found a dive slate which records their thoughts as dawn broke that morning. In a wobbly scrawl faded by months in the water, Tom Lonergan had written: ""[Mo]nday Jan 26; 1998 08am. To anyone [who] can help us: We have been abandoned on A[gin]court Reef by MV Outer Edge 25 Jan 98 3pm. Please help us [come] to rescue us before we die. Help!!!""Other clues offered tantalising glimpses of what might have happened. A wetsuit of Eileen's size washed up in north Queensland in early February; scientists measuring the speed of barnacle growth on its zip estimated that it was lost on January 26. Tears in the material around the buttocks and armpit had apparently been caused by coral.Inflatable dive jackets marked with Tom and Eileen's names were later washed ashore north of Port Douglas, along with their tanks - still buoyed up by a few remnants of air - and one of Eileen's fins. None showed any signs of the damage you would expect from a violent end, suggesting that the couple were not the victim of a shark attack, as the film suggests. Experts at the inquest speculated that, drifting helplessly back and forth on the tides in the building heat of the tropical sun, the couple may have been driven delirious by dehydration and have voluntarily struggled out of their cumbersome outfits. Without the buoyancy provided by their dive jackets and wetsuits, they would not have been able to tread water for long.Publicity surrounding the case spelled disaster for the Queensland dive industry. Nearly 50,000 people work in Queensland's Barrier Reef tourist trade, which is worth A$4.3bn and hosts nearly 4m day trips every year. High-profile horror stories could irrevocably taint the image of local operators. Worse still, this had not been simply an unavoidable accident. Dive boat crews are meant to count every diver into and out of the water and then carry out a further count when the boat leaves the dive site, but somehow the Lonergans had slipped through the net.Outer Edge skipper Jack Nairn said that he had ordered a crew member to carry out the count, and that the numbers had become confused because two passengers had jumped into the water halfway through. In any case, no one seems to have noticed that two sets of diving gear were missing as the boat steamed back to Port Douglas, nor was any alarm raised the following day when the Outer Edge returned to the same spot. It was only two days later, when Nairn found a bag containing the Lonergans' wallet and passports on the boat, that the alarm was raised. By that time, Tom and Eileen would probably already have died.",4,There's a point to the way it was filmed.,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,5589,"['reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'get', 'sense',

858858,A97Q71MM5N4NW,B00064AE0G,"Everett ""Future Raptured""","[15, 18]","I know a lot of people said they were going to give out bad votes to people who said they liked this movie. Well, I was one of the people who liked Open Water. I indeed say I know why a lot of didn't. When purchased by Lion Gate's Films, Open Water was distributed as a big budget movie, and that could probably be the help of the exaggerated posters, but I think it brought in a good thrill here and there especially since I had my own experience with a shark when I was little.Susan Watkins and Daniel Kintner (Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis) are an overworked couple who are trying to find a good vacation they can both enjoy, and where else is there to go on such an occasion that paradise? And naturally, in paradise, anyone would want to go diving out on the irresistable coral reef, surrounded with beautiful water in the open ocean.But the unthinkable happens to the two when they are accidentally left out in the middle of the ocean by their incompetent tour boat 15 miles from shore. The two try to keep calm within the first few hours presuming the boat will be back, but soon, sharks begin to encircle, and the weather doesn't look too good for the two either. But even after drifting into 1,000,000 square miles of ocean, the couple soon realizes what they always feared: no one even knows they are missing.Indeed I think it's a very well done movie and worth owning. A lot of people were dissappointed with Open Water because they didn't know it was going to be shot on digital video and on a low budget. They most likely expected a big budget film. The thing about the movie that made it interesting was that it had only a crew of three people not including the actors. The crew consisted of only the director Chris Kentis, his wife Laura Lau who was the producer, and her sister Estelle Lau, who also starred in the movie. The whole movie which looked expensive with how it was made, was spent on every single cent of their budget of $130,000. Not many people cared about how it was made because they hated the movie, but once I realized how it was made, I had a whole new aspect on it.Don't ask me why, but it felt neat to be watching a movie in the same manner that documentaries are made in, shooting on digital video. I felt at any moment someone was going to come on the screen and start talking about the subject. I just found that neat in a way. At times it does make you feel like you're watching a documentary, but the illusion soon sits in about these two unfortunate people.The movie which starred unknown actors had a chemistry between Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis that seemed unlikely within a lot of other big budget movies of our time. They just seemed to go good as a couple, almost perfect with the way they acted. It seemed also smart to work with unknown actors because the unknown ones are also the ones that do the best in anything. Well known actors are okay, but are too used to acting already. Saul Stein and Estelle Lau also did very good jobs for the small parts they had including the rest of the cast.It was originally only intended for the Sundance film festival, but I'm thrilled that Lion's Gate Films bought it out or else I would've never seen it, probably. Also, I liked the idea of having it based on true events because the real couple never did make it back to dry land. It was three days before anyone even realized they were gone.

858859,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,B00064AE0G,.fgd,"[1, 3]","This film is not high rise Gore and terror. There is not a psychologically clever or dramatically real / intense.script between Daniel and Sue in order to make the film work because it is limited to lead roles bobbing on the ocean most of the time,The producers have an eye and ear for good photography and music that really carries along the film well. It is fortunate the couple are mere yuppies because I doubt the producers could have handled any thing more demanding and it would have turned into another innane popular drama seen too much on tv these days. The so called shallow or bland dialogue given the situation works because it juxataposes how unnatural man is to the wilderness of nature; or as to the film, to the nature of the sky, the ocean, the mind of a shark.Modern man himself is a yuppie COMPARED to the natural world., more so all the gadgets and comforts so necessary to his life. This includes all the gadgetry to relax and entertain himself on holiday aka all the diving equipment instead of the beach or a boat. So Daniel and Sue parody themselves as yuppies. Wether the viewer instinctively realises the parody, is the difference between liking the film or not. Within the parody,  I found the dialogue did its job in terms of inferring horror disbelief denial frustration caring. It was even humorous the Way Daniel's voice cracked like a wimp a few times.Against the yuppie parody juxtaposition of modern man alien to Nature, ( how alien land life IZ to sea life) there was the very real atavistic fear especially on Sue's face and the way they both looked truly chilled so long in the cold water while filming. This atavistic. Fear we carry is WHY we seek out horror in films. It is as old as the stone-age the fear to be hunted, fear of snakes, being burned alive etc etc....The actress playing Sue mentions being genuinely unnerved by the real sharks used during filming and this non acting gets transmissioned to the viewers. It tied into an atavistic terror of mine about swimming in the sea at night if feet don't touch the bottom, all ignited from watching Jaws as a teen.This ties into the wonderful music score, a carribean folk-song of sorts . Folk songs tell stories about things important to remember in the collective conciouness even unconciousness of the tribe or the mind. And so the musical voices with beauttiful melody, are also singinging about fear of the deep blue sea from some old wise understanding from all the tales told through the ages of drownings or being hunted by creatures. In a way it seems to make the two humans in despair even smaller and the beauty of life and nature will go on and on. Their suffering a blip.All the time in the film the screen is filled with sky and waves and sea-scape paranormas in a synchronicity with the music's message. Great photographyy at eye level that almost participates the viewers to BE in the water also. And therefore among the sharks. Atavistic fear is built on subliminal triggers. This is why the thinnest cut of a sharks fin is more terrifying than its jaws in a full frontal shot. The water is infested-what is unseen yet known is worse.I bought this movie because I never tire of the music singing 'I told you so....' or the sea/sky wherein Nature as incredibly beautifully and artistically complex as it is dangerous because infinite to personal or human power (we still have the damage from global warming to deal with, the flooding to come, and neucleur war worries) and the possible panic of swimming at night",5,suprisingly good,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,3522,"['film', 'not', 'high', 'rise', 'Gore', 'terror', 'not', 'psychologically', 'clever', 'dramatically', 'real', '/', 'intense.script', 'Daniel', 'Sue', 'order', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'limited', 'lead', 'roles', 'bobbing', 'ocean', 'most', 'time', 'producers', 'have', 'eye', 'ear', 'good', 'photography', 'music', 'really', 'film', 'well', 'fortunate', 'couple', 'are', 'mere', 'yuppies', 'doubt', 'producers', 'could', 'have', 'handled', 'thing', 'more', 'demanding', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'innane', 'popular', 'drama', 'seen', 'too', 'much', 'tv', 'days', 'so', 'called', 'shallow', 'bland', 'dialogue', 'given', 'situation', 'how', 'unnatural', 'man', 'wilderness', 'nature', 'film', 'nature', 'sky', 'ocean', 'mind', 'shark.Modern', 'man', 'yuppie', 'COMPARED', 'natural', 'world.', 'more', 'so', 'gadgets', 'comforts', 'so', 'necessary', 'life', 'gadgetry', 'relax', 'entertain', 'holiday', 'diving', 'equipment', 'instead', 'beach', 'boat', 'Daniel', 'Sue', 'parody', 'yuppies', 'viewer', 'instinctively', 'parody', 'difference', 'liking', 'film', 'not', 'parody', 'found', 'dialogue', 'did', 'job', 'terms', 'inferring', 'horror', 'disbelief', 'denial', 'frustration', 'caring', 'was', 'even', 'humorous', 'Way', 'Daniel', 'voice', 'cracked', 'wimp', 'few', 'times.Against', 'yuppie', 'parody', 'juxtaposition', 'modern', 'man', 'alien', 'Nature', 'how', 'alien', 'land', 'life', 'IZ', 'sea', 'life', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'atavistic', 'fear', 'especially', 'Sue', 'face', 'way', 'looked', 'truly', 'chilled', 'so', 'long', 'cold', 'water', 'filming', 'atavistic', 'carry', 'WHY', 'seek', 'out', 'horror', 'films', 'as', 'old', 'stone-age', 'fear', 'be', 'hunted', 'fear', 'snakes', 'being', 'burned', 'alive', 'etc', 'etc', '.The', 'actress', 'playing', 'Sue', 'mentions', 'being', 'genuinely', 'unnerved', 'real', 'sharks', 'used', 'filming', 'non', 'acting', 'transmissioned', 'viewers', 'tied', 'atavistic', 'terror', 'mine', 'swimming', 'sea', 'night', 'feet', 'do', ""n't"", 'touch', 'bottom', 'ignited', 'watching', 'Jaws', 'teen.This', 'wonderful', 'music', 'score', 'carribean', 'folk-song', 'sorts', 'Folk', 'songs', 'tell', 'stories', 'things', 'important', 'remember', 'collective', 'conciouness', 'even', 'unconciousness', 'tribe', 'mind', 'so', 'musical', 'voices', 'beauttiful', 'melody', 'are', 'also', 'singinging', 'fear', 'deep', 'blue', 'sea', 'old', 'wise', 'understanding', 'tales', 'told', 'ages', 'drownings', 'being', 'hunted', 'creatures', 'way', 'make', 'two', 'humans', 'despair', 'even', 'smaller', 'beauty', 'life', 'nature', 'will', 'go', 'suffering', 'blip.All', 'time', 'film', 'screen', 'filled', 'sky', 'waves', 'sea-scape', 'paranormas', 'synchronicity', 'music', 'message', 'Great', 'photographyy', 'eye', 'level', 'almost', 'viewers', 'BE', 'water', 'also', 'therefore', 'sharks', 'Atavistic', 'fear', 'built', 'subliminal', 'triggers', 'why', 'thinnest', 'cut', 'sharks', 'fin', 'more', 'terrifying', 'jaws', 'full', 'frontal', 'shot', 'water', 'infested-what', 'unseen', 'yet', 'known', 'worse.I', 'bought', 'movie', 'never', 'tire', 'music', 'singing', 'told', 'so', 'sea/sky', 'wherein', 'Nature', 'incredibly', 'beautifully', 'artistically', 'complex', 'dangerous', 'infinite', 'personal', 'human', 'power', 'still', 'have', 'damage', 'global', 'warming', 'deal', 'flooding', 'come', 'neucleur', 'war', 'worries', 'possible', 'panic', 'swimming', 'night']",N/A

The plot of the movie, if you haven't figured it out yet, is that a couple in a rocky marriage go scuba diving while on vacation, the guy in charge of the boat makes the idiotic mistake of counting two passengers twice in his head count before shoving back to shore, and this couple is stranded in the middle of the ocean. There are several things that really annoyed me about the movie.First, I can't figure out if it was bad acting or bad scripting, but the reactions of the characters were extremely unbelievable. For example, when the couple resurfaces to find their boat left them stranded, their reaction was essentially ""Check it out - they left us out here with nothing but our scuba gear. That kind of sucks.""Second, the camera work had a very annoying ""Blair Witch"" quality to it.Third, a scene of absolutely pointless frontal nudity actually made me shout ""Come on!"" at the television. Maybe a perk for some, but a show of tasteless filmaking to me.Finally, the movie had an inherent difficulty to overcome to begin with. The majority of the movie involves dialogue between only two characters against an unchanging backdrop of endless water. The task the filmakers should have set out to achieve was to take that difficulty and overcome it with flawless writing and acting. They failed miserably - the pace of the movie was extremely slow and left you annoyed because you wish they would just move along.If you still are curious and really think you want to see this movie, I won't give away the ending, but please rent this movie rather than buy it or you will most likely be supremely disappointed.",1,Way to encourage people to go scuba diving...,1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,1766,"['really', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'movie', '0', 'stars', 'quite', 'possibly', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'had', 'absolutely', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'plot', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'figured', 'out', 'yet', 'couple', 'rocky', 'marriage', 'go', 'scuba', 'diving', 'while', 'vacation', 'guy', 'charge', 'boat', 'idiotic', 'mistake', 'counting', 'two', 'passengers', 'twice', 'head', 'count', 'shoving', 'back', 'shore', 'couple', 'stranded', 'middle', 'ocean', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'really', 'annoyed', 'movie.First', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'was', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'scripting', 'reactions', 'characters', 'were', 'extremely', 'unbelievable', 'example', 'when', 'couple', 'resurfaces', 'find', 'boat', 'left', 'stranded', 'reaction', 'was', 'essentially', 'Check', 'out', 'left', 'out', 'here', 'nothing', 'scuba', 'gear', 'kind', 'sucks', 'Second', 'camera', 'work', 'had', 'very', 'annoying', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'quality', 'it.Third', 'scene', 'absolutely', 'pointless', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'actually', 'made', 'Come', 'television', 'Maybe', 'perk', 'show', 'tasteless', 'filmaking', 'me.Finally', 'movie', 'had', 'inherent', 'difficulty', 'overcome', 'begin', 'majority', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'only', 'two', 'characters', 'unchanging', 'backdrop', 'endless', 'water', 'task', 'filmakers', 'should', 'have', 'set', 'out', 'achieve', 'was', 'take', 'difficulty', 'overcome', 'flawless', 'writing', 'acting', 'failed', 'miserably', 'pace', 'movie', 'was', 'extremely', 'slow', 'left', 'annoyed', 'wish', 'would', 'just', 'move', 'along.If', 'still', 'are', 'curious', 'really', 'think', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'please', 'rent', 'movie', 'rather', 'buy', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'supremely', 'disappointed']",N/A

Buttkus,"[5, 6]","Chris Kentis had an interesting idea, based on true events, and for a slim 130k he produced it, wrote it, directed it, was the cinematographer, and with is wife edited it. He clearly illustrated that a talented man with a nothing budget could create a good film. He packed up his actors and sparse crew and flew to the Bahamas. He simply went out into the open sea and shot the piece. The actors were put in thin metal mesh under their wet suits, but when the shark wranglers tossed out the chum bait, those were real sharks that came to call.This film took Sundance and the Seattle Film Festival by storm. Kentis let our imagination do a lot of the work, like Spielberg did in the first third of JAWS. There were some stock shots of sharks to heighten tension, but when those fins surfaced very near the actors, and those gray-brown shapes passed below them, foam rubber did not come to mind.The two principal actors were relative unknowns. Blanchard Ryan who played Susan had done some film work before, but for Daniel Travis, who played Daniel, this was his film debut. Ryan as Susan was fresh, sexy, and smart. She seemed comfortable in her one nude scene, and her character seemed a little more focused than Travis managed with Daniel. He was stuck somewhere between wooden and animated; his emotional shadings seemed a little pushed.Our primal fears were explored in great depth. Fear of abandonment was first on the list. Followed by fear of death by exposure or drowning, and underscored with the most visceral fear of them all; fear of being eaten alive, or being torn to pieces. Kentis kept the dialogue realistic. The characters talked the way people would who have known each other for a long time;no histrionics, no poetry, and no philosophy.Kentis cut the film brilliantly, and handled the passage of time interestingly. He opted to use natural light, even at night during a thunderstorm, letting the flashes of lightning give us a black light feel to the scene. A strong sense of hopelessness began to emerge after the characters failed to reach nearby boats, a buoy, and a passing freighter. And of course we became more and more aware of those dark dorsel fins slicing the waves, cruising around them in ever decreasing circles.I liked this film. It had a lot of fresh perspective on familiar themes.

It is plain dreadful to watch.Here is the so-called story line:  A yuppie couple finds time for a last minute diving vacation together.  They get left behind by their tour operator.  Then they float for the next hour and a half and find time to fight with one another while avoiding sharks.  Eventually the man dies and the woman commits suicide.My problems with this movie are as follows:  first off it was filmed with what looks like a $200 used camcorder.  I could have gotten past this if the rest of the movie was ok but it wasn't.  The yuppie couple at no time during this movie gives anyone any reason to like them.  They are a couple of spoiled, rich, self involved people that I could have cared less about.  There dialogue together is completely mechanical.  They should have spent a day or two getting to know one another.  This movie seems like they met for the first time when they turned the camera on.  At no time did I consider this movie suspenseful.  In fact most of the time I was hoping they would get eaten.I realize this was made on a budget and they wanted to try something different.  It just did not work.The ending was somewhat prophetic though.  The movie would get eaten up alive by the sharks (critics and viewers) and both actors have committed hollywood suicide.  I doubt either will be in a movie again.

This film isn't about sharks and what they are randomly capable of doing to other living creatures within their natural habitat. This is a charming film about a couple who, despite their incredibly horrific and terrifying dilemna of being mistakenly abandoned out in the middle of the open sea miles from land, courageously strive to cope with the reality of their circumstance. Your compassion for this couple builds as the movie progresses. They cling to life with a desperate hope of surviving their nightmarish ordeal by affectionately nurturing each other's fears of the unknown beneath the waves. Strangely enough, they both remain calm throughout the most obvious panic stricken moments of the predators' presence - what else can you do? Sure, there is the natural need of the human animal to dispel inner rage, anger and resentment verbally, if not physically, which the male half of this doomed duo projects at the open sea, the sharks and even his mate. All is forgiven, their love and understanding of each other overcomes their darkest fears.

858871,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00064AE0G,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 6]","After reality TV we now have reality cinema. Nothing new. It was a fad to have that kind of reality radio in the late 1960s in Europe. The point is that for radio the radioman, be he what he may be, was standing at a street corner with his mike and recording. Then later he broadcasted the whole thing in real time. It did not last long because raw sound is unrecognizable on the radio. With TV it is of course entirely rigged because the people are selected, they know they are on TV, they have been groomed and trained to do this or that, etc.For the cinema it is even more artificial since we have actors, including the real sharks in the ocean. As for showing real events, such a film is a fake. The only thing it shows very well is the sloppiness of some tour operators and other tourist industry profiteers who do not even know how to count up to twenty or twenty-two, and who do not know how to call a roll, and who do not check their boat on arrival at the harbour. Every year such accidents happen. A couple of years ago, in Sri Lanka, a jeep outing was organized in a natural park to go see wild elephants. A jeep, with gesticulating people in it, in the middle of the day (wild elephants in Sri Lanka are night animals) hence in the elephants' resting period come to disturb, perturb and even annoy these wild elephants.Regulations are strict. No one stands in the jeep, at least when it is running, and no one gets off the jeep. The jeep stops, everyone stands to take nice pictures of the elephants that are nicely agitated. One girl - sorry it was a girl - gets off the jeep. One elephant starts charging. The jeep drives away. The girl on the ground is trampled to death. She did not respect a security rule. She may not have understood the explanation that may or may not have been given to her. No one sees her getting off the jeep and no one checks when the jeep starts.That kind of sloppy business is commonplace in the tourist industry, including in our countries : we have cases, some going to court, every year in  the mountains : skiing accident, mountaineering accidents, sudden floods from mountain rivers that take away a bunch of kids, etc. That's what guides are all about, and even well trained guides can make a mistake, make a wrong prediction on the weather, or simply run into an unlucky moment. The point is that this dimension of the film covers about five minutes whereas the rest is particularly artificial and lackluster.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",3,Beware the tourist industry !,1154217600,"07 30, 2006",2006,2480,"['reality', 'TV', 'now', 'have', 'reality', 'cinema', 'Nothing', 'new', 'was', 'fad', 'have', 'kind', 'reality', 'radio', 'late', '1960s', 'Europe', 'point', 'radio', 'radioman', 'be', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'was', 'standing', 'street', 'corner', 'mike', 'recording', 'Then', 'later', 'broadcasted', 'whole', 'thing', 'real', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'last', 'long', 'raw', 'sound', 'unrecognizable', 'radio', 'TV', 'course', 'entirely', 'rigged', 'people', 'are', 'selected', 'know', 'are', 'TV', 'have', 'been', 'groomed', 'trained', 'do', 'etc.For', 'cinema', 'even', 'more', 'artificial', 'have', 'actors', 'including', 'real', 'sharks', 'ocean', 'showing', 'real', 'events', 'film', 'fake', 'only', 'thing', 'very', 'well', 'sloppiness', 'tour', 'operators', 'other', 'tourist', 'industry', 'profiteers', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'how', 'count', 'up', 'twenty', 'twenty-two', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'call', 'roll', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'check', 'boat', 'arrival', 'harbour', 'year', 'such', 'accidents', 'happen', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'jeep', 'outing', 'was', 'organized', 'natural', 'park', 'go', 'see', 'wild', 'elephants', 'jeep', 'gesticulating', 'people', 'middle', 'day', 'wild', 'elephants', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'are', 'night', 'animals', 'hence', 'elephants', 'resting', 'period', 'come', 'disturb', 'perturb', 'even', 'annoy', 'wild', 'elephants.Regulations', 'are', 'strict', 'one', 'jeep', 'least', 'when', 'running', 'one', 'jeep', 'jeep', 'stops', 'everyone', 'take', 'nice', 'pictures', 'elephants', 'are', 'nicely', 'agitated', 'One', 'girl', 'sorry', 'was', 'girl', 'jeep', 'One', 'elephant', 'charging', 'jeep', 'away', 'girl', 'ground', 'trampled', 'death', 'did', 'not', 'respect', 'security', 'rule', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'understood', 'explanation', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'one', 'getting', 'off', 'jeep', 'one', 'when', 'jeep', 'starts.That', 'kind', 'sloppy', 'business', 'commonplace', 'tourist', 'industry', 'including', 'countries', 'have', 'cases', 'going', 'court', 'year', 'mountains', 'skiing', 'accident', 'mountaineering', 'accidents', 'sudden', 'floods', 'mountain', 'rivers', 'take', 'away', 'bunch', 'kids', 'etc', 'what', 'guides', 'are', 'even', 'well', 'trained', 'guides', 'can', 'make', 'mistake', 'make', 'wrong', 'prediction', 'weather', 'simply', 'run', 'unlucky', 'moment', 'point', 'dimension', 'film', 'five', 'minutes', 'rest', 'particularly', 'artificial', 'lackluster.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

858874,A2VRAT69JDAD3W,B00064AE0G,"Jason Whitt ""Whittmeister""","[5, 9]","This film has been reviewed extensively on Amazon.com and opinions seem to be quite polarized as to whether it is worth one's time to see.  For my money, Open Water employs a story concept that shows promise but does not remotely deliver.This isn't a typical blood and guts shark movie which is why I was excited to see it to begin with.  I expected to see a different spin on an overly tread genre.  Something a bit more enlightened was what I hoped for and as such anticipated viewing the film greatly.  I was greatly disappointed as you will read.Open Water is an independent film that attempts to create a sort of hybrid indie documentary/suspense movie.  The cinematography, despite the budget, is the one strong point of the film.  The acting on the other hand is passable at first but the 2 main characters soon wear thin and just become blatantly annoying.The premise of the film is a good one...that unfortunately never really goes anywhere.  A couple whose relationship is on the rocks goes to a tropical island on vacation to salve their ailing marriage.  Early in the film, while scuba diving in the middle of the ocean, the couple is accidentally left behind by the charter boat.  We are then forced to watch as the couple spends the next day or so floating helplessly and bickering in the ocean while occasionally being stalked by sharks and other deep sea creatures.  Trust me when I say that it's not nearly as interesting or suspenseful as it may sound.With a story so limited in scope, one would expect to see more in depth character study of the couple seasoned nicely with some moments of tension and anxiety.  But alas, during the 80 minutes we spend with the couple, virtually nothing meaningful is learned about them as people, nor is any palpable tension generated until the film is 80% over.  And even that tension is mild at best.I may be one of the few reviewers who didn't object to the film's eventual outcome.  I do however, object to the fact that no attempt whatsoever was made to inject any meaning or poigniance into the story.

858876,A1H3YRJR5N8A9W,B00064AE0G,J. C. Darling,"[2, 2]","I once heard ""Open Water"" described as ""Jaws Meets Blair Witch Project"". I'd say that this was a pretty accurate description. The film has a pseudo-documentary feel to it... like you're getting a fly on the wall's view of what the two main characters are experiencing - right down to the mundane elements of every-day living. I think this is what makes the movie as effective as it is: It's very real... so what happens to the main characters becomes very real regardless of how unfathomable their fates are.The whole premise of ""Open Water"" is truly terrifying. A couple on a scuba diving adventure get over-looked by the crew of their boat and left behind in the middle of the shark-infested ocean! Their reaction to their predicament moves slowly from amusement... to annoyance... to concern... to blame-placing..... to panic... and ultimately to terror as it becomes clearer and clearer to them that their boat is not coming back. Soon, the first dorsal fin breaks through the water and the sharks begin to appear in ever-increasing numbers.As for the shark factor - which is a big factor in this movie - I'd say ""Open Water"" has got a leg up on ""Jaws"". Primarily for the reasons I just mentioned. It's a very ""REAL"" movie whereas the circumstances in ""Jaws"" are totally fictitious and unlikely. In ""Jaws"", the shark is a fiendish monster put on earth (or in the sea) to terrorize and kill swimmers and boaters, while the sharks in ""Open Water"" are simply hungry fish doing what they do - swim and feed!For anyone who has not seen ""Open Water"" yet, I will not ruin the ending for you. I will say, however, that I was totally surprised - it caught me off guard I must admit.

The film is also frequently compared to the ""Blair Witch Project"", which I feel is more accurate, since, in my opinion, both films fail to deliver the thrills promised.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" was a clever idea for a film, that was in many ways poorly executed.  One could argue the opposite about ""Open Water"", since the questionable idea to show a couple floating in the ocean for about an hour was presented as well a possible - the result is the same, however.  The film also suffers from what I feel was a grossly inaccurate marketing campaign. If memory serves, the TV ads and trailers showed almost nothing but sharks, but they also show every shark scene in the film.  This was a mistake, given that the film ultimately doesn't derive its suspense or impact (what little suspense and impact there is) from shark attacks.

First of all, I admire Chris Kentis and his wife Laura Lau, for the courage and chutzpah to think a couple with a small budget could produce a motion picture for the big screen.  Perhaps unlike many American viewers I was well prepared to view such a film because I am already a fan of the often simple and low-budget efforts of Zhang Yimou, from China.This film, like Zhang's films, can be especially interesting because it can say so much about the viewer, and what's inside him or her -- like a Rorschach ink blot.  For this reason, the Amazon reviews of this movie are especially interesting.  Some reviewers have had their psyches and their primal fears touched in a telling way; others seem oblivious this.The technical qualities of this film: screenplay, acting, and filming are more than satisfactory, and the real events from which the inspiration is taken are compelling, especially for divers (as am I).  Any diver who knows the 1998 story of Tom and Eileen Lonergan from Baton Rouge, LA, and their fatal abandonment near the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, must think that such a fate is a diver's worst nightmare - far, far worse than any dread to be caused by any creature in the sea.As mentioned in the screenplay, such a tragedy is not unique, and even though the event of 1998 was well publicized, this movie will make the story unforgettable in a way that only well-known popular culture can.  In this way, this movie renders a valuable public service to make all divers and dive-boat operators aware of the possibility of this criminal negligence to the point of near paranoia.  I think this heightened awareness cannot help but save some innocent lives from a similar horrible fate.There is yet another useful message I took away from this film, and that is that all divers must assume primary responsibility for their own safety.  Over reliance on anyone else should be avoided.  It is one thing to put some trust in others, and quite another to put total trust in strangers in whose hands your very life is held.  Some healthy skepticism is often appropriate for self-preservation.This film is plenty scary enough to provoke many divers (including your humble correspondent) to take less for granted where their survival is at stake.

This goes on for about 90 minutes, and there is very little in the form of a storyline, and even less substantive dialogue.

Hopefully, you won't be in at the snack bar during this monumental moment.My advice is to skip this one and rent Jaws instead, even if you've seen it a dozen times.  Your 13th viewing of Jaws will still be better than this movie.

The acting is I guess believable but its quite dull, you won't really care what happens to them and the constant screaming and yelling by those two becomes so irritating.Apparently this is based on actual events of a couple who disappeared in '98.

Like BWP, it was shot very inexpensively on video and it deals with the horror of being stuck out in the middle of nowhere.  However, in a certain sense Open Water is more scary for two reasons: 1, you are in MUCH more danger in the water, and 2, the terrors in Open Water are completely realistic as opposed to supernatural.  As it says at the beginning, ""Based on true events"" - I don't know if that is for true, but this really could happen.The plot is simple enough: a vacationing couple go scuba diving and the boat takes off without them, leaving them stranded in the open water.  They can't see land and they can't swim anywhere.  The terror mounts gradually - at first the couple refuses to believe that they are in any danger: they're on vacation, after all.  They see boats around them - surely one will pick them up.The great technical achievement of this film - the one that kicks it up a notch from Blair Witch - is that it uses live actors and live sharks.  There are no special effects on this film - the sharks are shown swimming just out of arms reach of the actors through most of the movie.  The maddening thing is that they don't attack and the couple having nothing to do but wait.

It's realistic, it could be made for cheap, and we know, thanks to ""Jaws"", that Americans are scared to death of sharks.  What on Earth could ever go wrong?  Everything.The first ten minutes tell you everything.  The opening shot is of Daniel (played by Daniel Travis) packing his SUV.  After a short call to a work associate he calls his wife, Susan (Blanchard Ryan) and prompts her to speed it up. It is apparent that the couple is in desperate need of a vacation; the acting at this point is about what you would find in a first tier porn film.  From here the film moves quickly to the couple aboard the plane, where the credit sequence begins, and then onto the beach of some tropical island.  With the exception of the title card, the credits are awful and worse yet the shot selection and camera movement is amateurish at best.Bad acting and cinematography continue as the film shows Daniel and Susan's first night in the hotel.  There is about 30 seconds of absolute cheap nudity as the couple gets into bed and then scene evolves, showing that the couple might have more problems than originally thought.  After they go to sleep there is a blackout and then a montage of more awkward shots as they wake up several times throughout the night and into the early morning.20 minutes into the film they make it out to sea.  The acting seems to go up a notch and there is some suspense as you're waiting learn how the two are left behind.  The next hour shows Daniel and Susan going through a wide range of emotions, arguments, and encounters with sea creatures as they struggle to survive.  At no point did I feel that the film was suspenseful or truly terrifying; it comes across as a huge disappointment.  Also, because there are only two major characters and they are in the middle of the ocean, there are multitudes of static shots.  This, more than anything, brings the film down. The film becomes tedious and ultimately boring; I just wanted it to be over with.""Open Water"" is only the second film for director Chris Kentis.  He also took on the role of DP and adapted the story.

Sure, it has real shark action in it (except for the biting parts), but there isn't quite enough here in the way of character development to warrant more than three stars.  The beginning of the flick introduces us to Susan and Daniel, two of the most annoying young adults you'll ever run into.  They constantly bicker, even when they're in the middle of the ocean.  I was really gunning for the sharks to take a nip of both of them just to make them shut up.The movie is rather short, but what can you really do to fill up more than about eighty minutes of a story about a couple stranded in the ocean and terrorized by sharks?  It isn't as if the sharks can scheme together on how they'll make Susan stop whining.  The bulk of the flick is Susan and Daniel either whining about being cold and hungry or blaming each other for being in their seaworthy predicament.  This makes the film rather boring since the dialogue and acting isn't that great.The film gets good when the sharks pop on screen.  They are the only reason I'm giving this film three stars.  They're shown cruising beneath their victims, butting their victims, and rolling their victims.  It's rather eerie to watch on the screen.Other than the shark action, however, this movie is pretty dull.

The natural beauty and mystery of the oceans attract several thousand tourists each year, and each year many disappear into the dark depth of the deep-sea.  The oceans are vast and enormously powerful as they blindly exist with all the creatures below, above, or in-between it's surface.  The sea does not take lives, it merely exists, as human beings are simply a hopelessly insignificant piece of the food chain in the big blue.  Open Water depicts one of these true stories as a tourist's boat brings a small group of divers out to the Magical Reef somewhere in the Caribbean, and forgets about a married couple.Daniel (Daniel Travis) and Susan (Blanchard Ryan) live in a comfortable house from which they often administer their hectic jobs with cell phones and laptops.  Susan even brings her laptop with her on vacation as she cannot completely let go of her job.  However, they finally arrive to the tropical paradise of the Caribbean where they can enjoy a peace of the beach while sipping on cocktails.  While vacationing they experience small hassles such as waking up in the middle of the night to bugs that bother them and to an all too familiar sound, the alarm clock, which reminds them about their scuba diving trip.The weather is beautiful, and the divers are all excited about getting into the blue to gaze at living creatures of various kinds.  Daniel and Susan drift off by themselves knowing that they have until 10:30 am to watch fish, small sharks, and other exotic sea creatures.  When the couple resurfaces they notice that the boat is not where it is suppose to be, as they can see some other boats at a distance.  They wait and wait, until the truth slowly begins to settle in their panic stricken minds.  Initially it leads to a common quarrel, but it ebbs away as they slowly begin to loose hope of ever seeing land again.Open Water holds the audience by the head and whenever the viewer has received enough air to breath the visuals push the viewer down below the surface again to jog the memory of the horrors underneath.  The continuous dipping up and down never becomes tedious as the viewer will feel that air is a must while remaining unknowing of what is under the surface.  This unknowing manner in which Open Water approaches the audience stirs up fears and anxiety, which could very well be experienced by both the audience and the characters.There are several moments when the film could cause an exhaustive experience as many shots are long, and without movement of the camera.  The long shots should be a reminder of what could be entering the minds of Susan and Daniel.  They also bring an authentic experience to the audience, which is enhanced by shooting the film with a digital camera.  The digital camera provides the same effect as a grainy film does when the director wants to depict the truth.  The graininess of the images could be compared to the Blair Witch Project (1999), which also wanted to generate an authentically haunting atmosphere.

I just had to watch it a second time with a small hope that some how it would miraculously end differently this time. I know that sounds dumb, but hey, that's how freaked out I was by this movie.This movie definitely is not perfect. There is a little confusion on how the couple gets left behind. There's also a scene where the couple is trying to signal down a boat that is heading towards them and then it just cuts away to a different scene back on land and it comes back to the couple in the water without showing what happened with boat they were trying to wave down. That bugged me a little. But those were honestly the only things I could really find wrong and I consider those problems trivial when it comes down to where this film successfully tried to take you.I'd also lke to give props to the director/writer/producer for a job-well done on filming this movie with a digital camera.

Actually, looking at the reviews here now, this may be one of the worst reviewed movies on Amazon.com.  But I didn't think it was as bad as it is being made out to be.  I agree that the bulk of the movie is less than exciting with two people bobbing in the water dealing with the crisis of the hour.  But what could they (the filmmakers do)?  I would suspect if you or I were in the same situation with our significant other, that we would deal with the same emotions (fear, fatigue with the occaisional bickering as to whose fault it was).  So I don't really hold that against the film.  My criticisms are more in line with lack of character development.  I really didn't know enough of the characters to care about them or their fate.  I also think that when it was discovered that they were forgotten by the tour group company, that was poorly handled (as someone elso said, just a blah scene).But the movie tells a simple story in a very short period of time, so if you don't like it, you haven't lost much (better than watching a turkey like Magnolia for 3 hours and realizing that it really sucked).  The two leads were fine with their limited script and although the ending might not appeal to some, it is definitely plausible.I'd recommend Open Water as a rental, but probably not a purchase as it likely doesn't get better with additional viewings.",3,I Don't Think It's THAT Bad!,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,1431,"['rented', 'Open', 'Water', 'having', 'seen', 'reviews', 'beforehand', 'Actually', 'looking', 'reviews', 'here', 'now', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'reviewed', 'movies', 'Amazon.com', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'being', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'agree', 'bulk', 'movie', 'less', 'exciting', 'two', 'people', 'bobbing', 'water', 'dealing', 'crisis', 'hour', 'what', 'could', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'would', 'suspect', 'were', 'same', 'situation', 'significant', 'other', 'would', 'deal', 'same', 'emotions', 'fear', 'fatigue', 'occaisional', 'bickering', 'fault', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'hold', 'film', 'criticisms', 'are', 'more', 'line', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'characters', 'care', 'fate', 'also', 'think', 'when', 'was', 'discovered', 'were', 'forgotten', 'tour', 'group', 'company', 'was', 'poorly', 'handled', 'someone', 'elso', 'said', 'just', 'blah', 'scene', 'movie', 'simple', 'story', 'very', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'have', ""n't"", 'lost', 'much', 'better', 'watching', 'turkey', 'Magnolia', '3', 'hours', 'realizing', 'really', 'sucked', 'two', 'leads', 'were', 'fine', 'limited', 'script', 'ending', 'might', 'not', 'appeal', 'definitely', 'plausible.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Open', 'Water', 'rental', 'probably', 'not', 'purchase', 'likely', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'additional', 'viewings']",N/A

This has to be one of the finest pieces of independent film I've ever seen. Though the cinematography may be 'choppy', it adds to the sensation of bobbing up & down in the open sea as the current takes them along. I think it fared well with the two 'relative unknown' actors in the starring roles; big-name stars might have made it seem more cheesy. This is the stuff nightmares are made of - I can remember my own bad dreams as a child of falling off a boat in the middle of the ocean, the boat carrying on its way & being stranded in the open ocean.

Yes, they both have sharks in them, but ""Open Water"" has more and they are more realistic than Bruce, but I think the cinematic reference point for Chris Kentis' film is ""The Blair Witch Project."" This is not just because it is filmed with a digital video camera rather than a 35mm camera but because it is the same sort of stripped down filmmaking. For most of ""Open Water"" we are looking at a couple in the middle of the ocean. Usually we look at them from above, sometimes from below, and sometimes we get point of view shots or looks at what is lurking beneath the waves. But most of this movie is about those two people floating in the ocean.The two people are Susan (Blanchard Ryan) and Daniel (Daniel Travis); the ""Blair Witch Project"" analogy gets even stronger here because Blanchard is Ryan's middle name and her first name is Susan, but then we eventually learn the last name of the characters is Kitner, and that was the boy who gets eaten by the shark in ""Jaws."" They are a young couple who have finally found some time to get out of town and away from their lives (and cell phones). If this were a Greek tragedy you could point to the specific acts of hubris by each that doom them: he complains about her bringing along her laptop but she catches him using it while he finds her naked in bed but not in the mood for love making. Of course the Fates conspire against them that when heads are counted on the boat that they get missed and left behind.We know from the start that Susan and Daniel are in for the long haul once they find themselves all alone in the water. Periodically the time of day pops up in the corner of the screen to tell us how long it has been, but the hours just keep rolling along. There are sharks and other things in the water for Susan and Daniel to worry about to be sure, but there is also nobody else for them to blame but each other as they ride the emotional and physical rollercoaster of being out in the middle of nowhere. Not only does it definitely put life in perspective, it forces them to do the same thing with regards to death.""Open Water"" is a ""true"" story in the same sense as ""A Perfect Storm,"" where we basically know the start and the end (although I doubt the end Kentis comes up with is the same as the ""true"" story of the couple left behind in Australia's Great Barrier Reef) but the middle becomes conjecture. You can easily imagine Kentis, who wrote/directed/edited the film and is a certified diver, hearing the story of two divers being left behind and his mind coming up with thoughts and images of what that must have been like. The result is a sort of ""realism,"" as in the imitation of life that the ancient Greeks considered their tragic plays to be, in that I bought the idea that this is what it would be like and this is what would happen. You might not like the ending, but you cannot consider it a cop out.In a summer when I was assaulted by an overload of special effects in films like ""I, Robot,"" or treated to jiggling cameras and constant smash cuts in films like ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" this was a movie made by a guy sitting in a boat with a camera while two actors stayed in the water. ""Open Water"" is not cinema in the sense of ""Jaws,"" which had the virtues of Steven Spielberg's sense of montage and John Williams' unforgettable score, but a movie that gets it sense of suspense and terror from the situation. The editing is straightforward and the music, mostly ominious stirngs and drums, is rather minimalistic.I was thinking 4.0 for this film until the end, when I raised it a notch to 4.5.  The DVD extras are okay, but not quite enough to round up.  I fully understand that ""Open Water"" will not be appreciated by everybody who sees it (obviously given the vehement denunciations of the film) and that it is not a great film that any one will want to watch over and over again, like ""Jaws."" I watched ""Open Water"" again when it came out on DVD and will probably never watch it again. But it is an honest effort at filmmaking at a time when the rule is to substitute style and special effects for substance and story. Those who liked ""The Blair Witch Project"" until it turned out in the end to be a shaggy dog story will have no complaint on that score with this film.",4,Susan and Daniel get left behind in the big blue ocean,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,4388,"['obvious', 'comparison', 'just', 'everybody', 'be', 'making', 'Open', 'Water', 'Jaws', 'think', 'point', 'Yes', 'have', 'sharks', 'Open', 'Water', 'more', 'are', 'more', 'realistic', 'Bruce', 'think', 'cinematic', 'reference', 'point', 'Chris', 'Kentis', 'film', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'not', 'just', 'filmed', 'digital', 'video', 'camera', 'rather', '35mm', 'camera', 'same', 'sort', 'stripped', 'filmmaking', 'most', 'Open', 'Water', 'are', 'looking', 'couple', 'middle', 'ocean', 'Usually', 'look', 'sometimes', 'sometimes', 'get', 'point', 'view', 'shots', 'what', 'lurking', 'waves', 'most', 'movie', 'two', 'people', 'floating', 'ocean.The', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'Susan', 'Blanchard', 'Ryan', 'Daniel', 'Daniel', 'Travis', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'analogy', 'even', 'stronger', 'here', 'Blanchard', 'Ryan', 'middle', 'name', 'first', 'name', 'Susan', 'then', 'eventually', 'learn', 'last', 'name', 'characters', 'Kitner', 'was', 'boy', 'who', 'eaten', 'shark', 'Jaws', 'are', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'finally', 'found', 'time', 'get', 'town', 'away', 'lives', 'cell', 'phones', 'were', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'could', 'point', 'specific', 'acts', 'hubris', 'bringing', 'laptop', 'using', 'naked', 'bed', 'not', 'mood', 'love', 'making', 'course', 'Fates', 'conspire', 'when', 'heads', 'are', 'counted', 'boat', 'get', 'missed', 'left', 'behind.We', 'know', 'start', 'Susan', 'Daniel', 'are', 'long', 'haul', 'find', 'alone', 'water', 'Periodically', 'time', 'day', 'up', 'corner', 'screen', 'tell', 'how', 'long', 'been', 'hours', 'just', 'keep', 'rolling', 'along', 'are', 'sharks', 'other', 'things', 'water', 'Susan', 'Daniel', 'worry', 'be', 'sure', 'also', 'nobody', 'else', 'blame', 'other', 'ride', 'emotional', 'physical', 'rollercoaster', 'being', 'out', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Not', 'only', 'definitely', 'put', 'life', 'perspective', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'regards', 'death', 'Open', 'Water', 'true', 'story', 'same', 'sense', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'where', 'basically', 'know', 'start', 'end', 'doubt', 'end', 'Kentis', 'up', 'same', 'true', 'story', 'couple', 'left', 'behind', 'Australia', 'Great', 'Barrier', 'Reef', 'middle', 'conjecture', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'Kentis', 'who', 'wrote/directed/edited', 'film', 'certified', 'diver', 'hearing', 'story', 'two', 'divers', 'being', 'left', 'behind', 'mind', 'coming', 'up', 'thoughts', 'images', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'result', 'sort', 'realism', 'imitation', 'life', 'ancient', 'Greeks', 'considered', 'tragic', 'plays', 'be', 'bought', 'idea', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'would', 'happen', 'might', 'not', 'ending', 'can', 'not', 'consider', 'cop', 'out.In', 'summer', 'when', 'was', 'assaulted', 'overload', 'special', 'effects', 'films', 'Robot', 'treated', 'jiggling', 'cameras', 'constant', 'smash', 'cuts', 'films', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'was', 'movie', 'made', 'guy', 'sitting', 'boat', 'camera', 'two', 'actors', 'stayed', 'water', 'Open', 'Water', 'not', 'cinema', 'sense', 'Jaws', 'had', 'virtues', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'sense', 'montage', 'John', 'Williams', 'unforgettable', 'score', 'movie', 'sense', 'suspense', 'terror', 'situation', 'editing', 'straightforward', 'music', 'mostly', 'ominious', 'stirngs', 'drums', 'rather', 'minimalistic.I', 'was', 'thinking', '4.0', 'film', 'end', 'when', 'raised', 'notch', '4.5', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'okay', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'round', 'up', 'fully', 'understand', 'Open', 'Water', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'appreciated', 'everybody', 'who', 'obviously', 'given', 'vehement', 'denunciations', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'Jaws', 'watched', 'Open', 'Water', 'again', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'honest', 'effort', 'filmmaking', 'time', 'when', 'rule', 'substitute', 'style', 'special', 'effects', 'substance', 'story', 'who', 'liked', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'turned', 'out', 'end', 'be', 'shaggy', 'dog', 'story', 'will', 'have', 'complaint', 'score', 'film']",N/A

It's a simple plot: troubled couple goes on a diving vacation in the Caribbean to patch up their relationship but get stranded by the tour guide vessel, and are left to survive on their own with the natural elements including sharks. Some viewers complained that the movie did not explicitly inform viewers of the time, hours, and dates. I disagree, I like the way the script does not inform you because you are experiencing the same disorientation the couple is feeling. This is not Life of Pi with cute CGI animals.

On the one hand I appreciate the producers' ability to create a decent film on such a low budget. I also liked the fact that we're not watching some recycled actors. It was refreshing to see some new faces in Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis. Unfortunately, the film left me feeling someone empty. The land scenes seemed somewhat gratuitous. The producer should have used these few scenes to develop the characters a little more. For example, what was the point of the bedroom scene? As for the open water scenes where the majority of the film takes place, they were well done. Were they as scary as Jaws or as terrifying as reviews have made them out to be? I'd say no. They were a little too predictable.

A young couple, Daniel and Suzanne, exhibit the usual tensions of a relationship the night before a scheduled dive trip from an unnamed island, but are delighted to explore the depths of the ocean with the others on a chartered dive boat. When the dive times out, a busy attendant miscounts the returning divers and the couple, Daniel and Suzanne, resurface to find that they are alone in the water with no boat in sight. Only gradually coming to terms with the seriousness of their dilemma, the couple spends the first few hours frantically waving at distant boats on the horizon to no avail, finally resorting to word games until even that effort exhausts them.Eventually, the seriousness of their situation unavoidable, Suzanne and Daniel admit that their only hope lies in the dive boat returning, assuming they are noted as missing before the boat returns to shore. In reality, the boat has docked, the weary divers refreshed and enjoying island night life. It isn't until the following morning that the couple's dive gear is discovered and a search begun in earnest. Meanwhile, the hapless couple goes through the various stages one would expect in such circumstances, denial, rage, fear, grief, acceptance, at times terrified, then desperately clinging to one another for comfort. This is the predator's playground, the couple intruders, or, at best, fodder for the sea. The climax is striking, the tightening circle of sharks, the shocked faces of the helpless divers, the drone of the boats and search helicopters, the flashing fins, the quiet lapping of the waves, the end.

858915,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00064AE0G,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","I liked a lot this most excellent and incredibly shocking film, inspired by a true story. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.1. The true storyThomas Joseph Lonergan and Eileen Cassidy (n&eacute;e Hains) Lonergan, born 1964 and 1969, respectively, were a married couple from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States, who were mistakenly stranded in the Coral Sea on January 25, 1998, while scuba diving with a group of divers at St. Crispin's reef off Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The boat that had transported the group to the dive site departed from the location before the Lonergans returned from their dive, with none of the vessel's crew or passengers noticing that the two had not come back aboard. The couple was never found and they are presumed to have died at sea.2. The filmThis movie DOESN'T tell the tragic story of Thomas and Eileen Lonergan and quite a lot was changed here. The heroes names are Daniel Kintner (played by Daniel Travis) and Susan Watkins (played by Blanchard Ryan) and although they are a couple they don't seem to be married - also the whole story occurs in the Caribbean rather than in the Pacific. There are also some other changes, but I will not elaborate here as it would be revealing too much...This film was made on a (tiny) budget of 130 000 (yes, one hundred thirty thousand) USD and it went to earn 55 000 000 (fifty five million) USD - and I believe every single penny was well deserved! During most of the film we see only the two main actors and they stay mostly in the water, on the open sea, which removed most of needs for any kind of set... The biggest part of the budget was I believe devoted to the location of the boats and in obtaining good quality footage of REAL sharks...The acting approach the director and the scenarist selected was minimalistic - you should not expect here ony outbursts of frenzy, hysteria and dialogs are kept under strict discipline. Heroes are supposed to act as two people who find themselves completely unexpectedly in a life-threatening situation and try to cope with it - quite reasonably and logically.The great treasure of this film is to make as really feel what it means for a mere human being to struggle, virtually barehanded, with all the majestic might of the ocean. It also shows quite well the experience which a US Marine, who in 1995 went over board of USS &#34;America&#34; and spend two days in a similar situation, described as &#34;going in a second from the top to the bottom of the food chain&#34;...)))I liked this film a lot, but I must loyally warn you, that it has some disturbing moments. I watched it with my wife, my mother-in-law and my chipmunks - and for the next 24 hours they all refused to talk to me, so shocked they were... So be warned, this is TOUGH stuff. Still, let's stress it again, I liked it A LOT and considering the huge and unexpected success at the box office, clearly I wasn't the only one...

858916,A2TBMX78M7PD5T,B00064AE0G,"Malvolio ""scott15724""","[0, 4]","Synopsis: Workaholic twenty-somethings Susan and Daniel take a break from their hectic lives to vacation in the tropics, where they embark on a fateful scuba diving trip. After a half hour or so of pleasant underwater exploration, they break the surface to find that the dive charter boat has accidentally left them behind. Suddenly alone many miles from land, with sharks and nightfall closing in, the two cling to one another and hope to survive until someone notices their absence and comes back for them.I sure am glad I didn't have to write the script for Open Water. (Not that anyone was lining up to ask me.) You've got to be awfully creative, I think, to take a couple of actors, let 'em bob around in salt water for a while, and make a movie out of it. Not that it's Doctor Zhivago, of course - it's only 79 minutes long - but still. There are only so many possibilities you can explore involving angst, scuba gear, and sea fauna before you run out of either plot or players. And since you're making a suspense movie rather than, say, My Seafood Dinner With Andre, it's not like you can get too cerebral with the dialogue:""Was that a fin?""""Where?""""Something just brushed past my leg!""""We're all alone and in danger and really, really wet. Darn that stupid dive boat!""""This is all your fault! [Pause.] Was that another fin? Something else just bumped my leg!""And that, in a seashell, is the problem with Open Water. It's limited. Two not-very-interesting people whine, hope, commiserate, speculate, recriminate, and occasionally get nibbled on while a growing congregation of predators decide whether they've got a craving for neoprene. After the dive boat leaves the protagonists stranded, the film boils down to a single issue: will they be eaten by sharks, or not? And while that might sound like an interesting question, is really isn't. Because it doesn't matter what our heroes do - whether they swim or whether they drift, whether they're brave, cowardly, noble, spiteful, or what have you - the outcome is out of their hands. Like us, they've got nothing to do but wait.Contrast that with the classic of the genre: Jaws. The draw for that movie was, of course, a really really big shark. But what made the movie great had little to do with the fish and everything to do with the humans involved - how they took their lives in their own hands and risked them for their own compelling purposes.If Susan and Daniel from Open Water were vacationing on Amity Island at the time of the Jaws attacks, one can't imagine them deciding to accompany Chief Brody and Hooper and Quint on the Orca for their appointment with destiny. The young couple would no doubt have remained sensibly on the beach, working their cell phones and grumbling that they should've gone to St. Moritz instead.As it is, they're just a couple of yuppy schlubs who miss a travel connection and end up as live bait.

It is tough to say what I really think without providing spoilers but here goes.It works on the DVD because the extra features showing how the movie was made and on such a low budget(basically a husband and wife made it in their spare time with two unknown actors) makes the movie a lot better than it is.The beginning says that the movie is based on a true story and the director explained that he got the idea from a newspaper story he read.  The story is about a couple scuba diving on a vacation that get left out in the ocean by their boat.  While you watch this unfold you want to scream how stupid the people are that leave them there.  There were only 20 divers on the boat and they should have counted all the divers and called them all by name.  Additionlly after the people are left, you can see that there is an empty space where their air tanks should be and that their extra stuff is still there under the bench.That said, the movie is mostly about two people that are stranded in an extremely dangerous situation and how they slowly take it in that they are stranded in the middle of the ocean with the possibility of them becoming a shark's meal before they are rescued.  There are some really tense moments, especially when the two drift apart after falling asleep and the woman wakes up frantic that she is alone.",4,A good DVD if you watch the extra features,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,1433,"['would', 'be', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'big', 'screen', 'out', 'fine', 'small', 'screen', 'tough', 'say', 'what', 'really', 'think', 'providing', 'spoilers', 'here', 'goes.It', 'works', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'showing', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'low', 'budget', 'basically', 'husband', 'wife', 'made', 'spare', 'time', 'two', 'unknown', 'actors', 'movie', 'lot', 'better', 'beginning', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'director', 'explained', 'got', 'idea', 'newspaper', 'story', 'read', 'story', 'couple', 'scuba', 'diving', 'vacation', 'get', 'left', 'out', 'ocean', 'boat', 'watch', 'unfold', 'want', 'scream', 'how', 'stupid', 'people', 'are', 'leave', 'there', 'were', 'only', '20', 'divers', 'boat', 'should', 'have', 'counted', 'divers', 'called', 'name', 'Additionlly', 'people', 'are', 'left', 'can', 'see', 'empty', 'space', 'where', 'air', 'tanks', 'should', 'be', 'extra', 'stuff', 'still', 'bench.That', 'said', 'movie', 'mostly', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'stranded', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'how', 'slowly', 'take', 'are', 'stranded', 'middle', 'ocean', 'possibility', 'becoming', 'shark', 'meal', 'are', 'rescued', 'are', 'really', 'tense', 'moments', 'especially', 'when', 'two', 'drift', 'apart', 'falling', 'asleep', 'woman', 'up', 'frantic', 'alone']",N/A

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 2]","""Open Water"" plays like somebody's bad vacation video from the eighties, but it's no joke: Tom and Eileen Lonergan were a real life couple left behind in 1998 by the Outer Edge Dive Company during a scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef.  If you're not a fan of diving, sharks, or water, ""Open Water"" isn't going to change your mind.Daniel Kintner (Daniel Travis) and Susan Watkins (Blanchard Ryan) have decided to take a vacation to get away from their highly stressful day jobs. When out on their dive, they separate and the crew fails to accurately take a headcount due to one diver who forgot his equipment. When Daniel and Susan surface, they belatedly realize that nobody is coming back for them.That's it. That's the whole film.  Two people, with footage taken by a grainy camera, who can do nothing but float in the wide ocean.  Occasionally they dive below to see more. But other than those desperate forays, this is a stage play that takes place between two people on open water.  They go through the five stages of grief: Denying they've been forgotten, angry at each other for going on the trip, reconciling, giving up hope, and then finally accepting their fate.  Helping them along the way are fish, jellyfish, and sharks.  Lots and lots of sharks.Because ""Open Water"" is based on true events, there's no happy ending and barely a plot.  It's just two people in a beautiful vacation destination in open sight of ship that can't see them, abandoned by a support structure they took for granted.There's one point the film left out. Fishermen found a diver's slate that read:""[Mo]nday Jan 26; 1998 08am. To anyone [who] can help us: We have been abandoned on A[gin]court Reef by MV Outer Edge 25 Jan 98 3pm.

I was pleasantly surprised that this was a gem of a film that was made with not much money, but with a lot of heart and determination.If you watch the extra features you discover that they made this movie solely on week-ends and vacation time, all the while on a shoestring budget.  There were no stunt doubles (the actors were in the water with the sharks the whole time), no animatronic or CGI sharks (all the fish in the movie were abasolutely, 100% real), and the husband/wife team that made this movie did this almost entirely on their own with no huge studio backing them up, unitll Lion's Gate Films saw it at Sundance and bought it.  And, unlike many other movies set on the ocean, this was actually filmed in the real ocean...not some sound stage with an olympic-sized pool to safely film in.  In a nutshell, the place was real, the wildlife was real...this whole film was real.On the technical side of things, the sound is superb.  If you have a surround system at home, fire up the Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS surround mode and watch it.  You will get an undeniably creepy closed in feeling when the cameras are sumberged and the water sounds like it is enveloping you in your own living room!!!!The video is very clear, being it was shot on digital cameras.  The underwater scenery is just beautiful. On the surface you can see every detail when the sharks surface and circle the two stranded divers.

Minus the signature ""buh rump... buh rump"" from the Jaws theme, this film is scary enough as it is.  Working with factual events as the basis for their story, filmmakers Chris Kentis and Laura Lau have put together a gripping scenario of a couple abandoned far out to sea by their scuba excursion.Stressed with careers and a relationship that's clearly moved past the honeymoon phase, Susan and Daniel are seriously in need of a vacation.  That's underscored by phone calls on the way to the airport, time spent with the laptop in the hotel room, and mild bickering sufficient enough to cast an occasional cloud over potentially romantic moments.  Their escape takes them to a small Caribbean island where they begin to decompress with the standard sun, sand and libation.  But that relaxation reverses when they surface from a scuba diving excursion to discover that their boat is nowhere to be seen.  The drama from that point forward is as real as it gets, even down to the panic-fed arguments; one of which ends with the line ""I wanted to skiing...!""Forget mechanical sharks and CGI animated sea creatures, Open Water was filmed at sea with real threats - courtesy of a ""shark wrangler.""  Only 79 minutes in length, the film steadily builds the tension to the very end.  Blanchard Ryan (Susan) and Daniel Travis (Daniel) deserve praise for even agreeing to act under the circumstances in which they were placed, and they deliver solid, believable performances.Open Water won't appeal to everyone.  It was filmed on a shoestring budget, on digital video, with unknown actors; there is a scene with nudity that might offend some, and opinions regarding the ending seem to be split 50/50 between ""great"" and ""terrible"".  If any of that bothers you, then consider something else for your viewing enjoyment.I'm not normally a ""DVD extras"" kind of guy, but the interviews with Chris Kentis and Laura Lau, along with the commentary of the actors provide ample reason to choose this format over VHS.  Are you at all curious about how you protect a cameraman surrounded by a school of sharks?  And how do you get sharks to perform for the camera anyway?One footnote, Kentis and Lau were at a Thai seaside resort when the horrendous tsunami hit.  Fortunately, they managed to escape relatively unscathed.  I wonder if the experience might influence their next film project.",4,Realistically scary... not Hollywood scary,1106611200,"01 25, 2005",2005,2486,"['only', 'thing', 'might', 'make', 'compact', 'little', 'movie', 'more', 'terrifying', 'would', 'be', 'musical', 'score', 'John', 'Williams', 'signature', 'buh', 'rump', 'buh', 'rump', 'Jaws', 'theme', 'film', 'scary', 'enough', 'Working', 'factual', 'events', 'basis', 'story', 'filmmakers', 'Chris', 'Kentis', 'Laura', 'Lau', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'gripping', 'scenario', 'couple', 'abandoned', 'far', 'out', 'sea', 'scuba', 'excursion.Stressed', 'careers', 'relationship', 'clearly', 'moved', 'honeymoon', 'phase', 'Susan', 'Daniel', 'are', 'seriously', 'need', 'vacation', 'underscored', 'phone', 'calls', 'way', 'airport', 'time', 'spent', 'laptop', 'hotel', 'room', 'mild', 'bickering', 'sufficient', 'enough', 'cast', 'occasional', 'cloud', 'potentially', 'romantic', 'moments', 'escape', 'small', 'Caribbean', 'island', 'where', 'begin', 'decompress', 'standard', 'sun', 'sand', 'libation', 'relaxation', 'when', 'surface', 'scuba', 'diving', 'excursion', 'discover', 'boat', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'drama', 'point', 'forward', 'as', 'real', 'even', 'down', 'panic-fed', 'arguments', 'one', 'line', 'wanted', 'skiing', 'Forget', 'mechanical', 'sharks', 'CGI', 'animated', 'sea', 'creatures', 'Open', 'Water', 'was', 'filmed', 'sea', 'real', 'threats', 'courtesy', 'shark', 'wrangler', 'Only', '79', 'minutes', 'length', 'film', 'steadily', 'tension', 'very', 'end', 'Blanchard', 'Ryan', 'Susan', 'Daniel', 'Travis', 'Daniel', 'deserve', 'praise', 'even', 'agreeing', 'act', 'circumstances', 'were', 'placed', 'deliver', 'solid', 'believable', 'performances.Open', 'Water', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'everyone', 'was', 'filmed', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'digital', 'video', 'unknown', 'actors', 'scene', 'nudity', 'might', 'offend', 'opinions', 'regarding', 'ending', 'seem', 'be', 'split', '50/50', 'great', 'terrible', 'bothers', 'then', 'consider', 'something', 'else', 'viewing', 'enjoyment.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'normally', 'DVD', 'extras', 'kind', 'guy', 'interviews', 'Chris', 'Kentis', 'Laura', 'Lau', 'commentary', 'actors', 'provide', 'ample', 'reason', 'choose', 'format', 'VHS', 'Are', 'curious', 'how', 'protect', 'cameraman', 'surrounded', 'school', 'sharks', 'how', 'do', 'get', 'sharks', 'perform', 'camera', 'anyway', 'One', 'footnote', 'Kentis', 'Lau', 'were', 'Thai', 'seaside', 'resort', 'when', 'horrendous', 'tsunami', 'hit', 'Fortunately', 'managed', 'escape', 'relatively', 'unscathed', 'wonder', 'experience', 'might', 'influence', 'next', 'film', 'project']",N/A

Handheld digital video is well-suited to this tale of terror at sea -where everything bobs up and down anyway, so the film doesn't suffer much for its limited budget. If watching water makes you queasy, ""Open Water"" is not for you, but otherwise this is an effective reality-based film that exploits human impotence in the face of nature's power to tell a story of terror and regret.Susan (Blanchard Ryan) and Daniel (Daniel Travis) are a couple hoping to revive their strained marriage with a tropical vacation. While on a scuba-diving expedition, confusion in the head count causes their tour boat to leave without them, stranding the couple miles out at sea. Harassed by sharks and other sea creatures, the couple contend with their fears and with each other while hoping they will be rescued.Two people floating in the ocean for a hour is surprisingly watchable. Every time it begins to get tedious, the monotony is punctuated by some sort of action or change. There are several scenes of real suspense, and the two actors are able to keep us interested in the characters with only water, sharks, and silence to help them. I give Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis a lot of credit. They not only spent more than 120 hours in the water, a couple of days of it with 40-50 live, hungry sharks, but they are the film's sole focus, and these two unknown actors succeed in carrying it. Chris Kentis and Laura Lau deserve much praise, as well. Kentis wrote, directed, and, crucially, edited ""Open Water"" very well. Lau produced. And they both filmed. Two actors. Two camerapeople. That was the entire ensemble. No crew except a boat captain, Lau's sister, and a shark wrangler for 2 days. The wonders of digital video.""Open Water"" claims to be ""based on true events"". Inspired by real events would be more accurate. There  is no shortage of tales of scuba divers being accidentally abandoned miles off shore by their boats. But, if you are interested, the case that inspired ""Open Water"" is probably a 1998 incident in which American tourists Tom and Eileen Lonergan were left at the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia while on a scuba-diving excursion. There is no reason to think they had trouble with sharks, though. ""Open Water"" is a different story under similar circumstances. But knowing the Lonergans' story before viewing the film would spoil some surprises.The DVD: Bonus features include 2 featurettes, 2 audio commentaries, a theatrical trailer, 7 deleted scenes, and a little bonus footage. In ""The Indie Essentials: A Filmmaker's Guide to Gearing Up for a Marketable Movie"" (5 minutes), 3 representatives of Lion's Gate, director Chris Kentis and producer Laura Lau talk about the characteristics of successful indie films. ""Calm Beneath the Storm: The Making of Open Water"" includes interviews with Kentis, Lau, and actors Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis. Director and producer take us from figuring out what equipment they would need, though filming and up to their collaboration with Lion's Gate, which acquired ""Open Water"" at the Sundance Film Festival. One audio commentary is by actors Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis, who discuss their characters, the movie's themes, filming, and swimming with sharks. The other audio commentary is by director Chris Kentis and wife, producer Laura Lau. They talk about shooting with no crew, the story, and how they got those shark shots. Both commentaries are interesting and provide insight into inspired independent filmmaking.

It would have been a same thing if the movie was about getting lost in a forest and die or being left in somewhere very cold in winter and die.I think this movie may help reduce the accidents like the one in the movie, and it may have already saved some lives without knowing it.

It is an interesting story that focuses on a couple left behind after a 35 minute diving session in the ocean. When the couple comes to the surface the boat has left. They were a few minutes late and due to a miscount by one of the crew members they were thought to have everyone at departure time. Of course they did not. From this point on they deal with what you might expect drifting in open water. They encounter motion sickness that includes drifting in vomit, foating in each others urine (which wasn't to bad considering how cold they became after a while), jellyfish, other aggressive fish, and yes, ..sharks!!

Maybe since the husband had commented on a homicide/suicide, that he paid the tour guide to leave his wife behind? Maybe the couple fought so much that they both swam off their separate ways - One having a cramp drowning and the other being ran over by a boat.

This thriller develops slowly and there is not one specific climax, which allows you to believe this is really happening.  The thrill comes not from gory violence, but from the suspense of not knowing what is happening around you, and being powerless to change that fact.  The thrill in this case is also accentuated by the dread of slowly succumbing to death alone.This film has been compared to other faux-documentaries like the Blair Witch Project, but it is different in at least one important way.  The person holding the camera is not one of the screen characters.  The camera is a silent observer, tagging along to record the events as they unfold in real time.  This is important to remember during the brief bedroom scene.  The main characters are lying there unclothed, and at first it seems like a case of gratuitous nudity.  But then you remember these are two people on a romantic vacation, relaxing in the privacy of their own room.  During the ocean scenes, it almost feels like one of the lurking sharks has the camera strapped to its back.The conclusion is unexpected and uncertain.  There is very little dialogue at this point, and the viewer is left to wonder what exactly the characters are thinking.

Two people who are forgotten about by their scuba guides, and end up out in the middle of the ocean on their own.  In real life, the two people were never found, so it doesn't take a genius to figure out what happens at this movie's end.  It's very sad, and rather hopeless.  Don't expect to watch this and have a warmish feeling because the ""good guy"" beat the ""bad guy"" at the horror movie's ending.  When the ""bad guy"" is the entire shark infested ocean, there's not much the good guy can do.The subject matter aside, this was a very well done movie.  The actors do an excellent job of stressing how absolutely frightening it would be if lost in open shark teeming waters.  This is of course partly because the waters they were in were filled with sharks, and they were actually scared, but also because the director doesn't try to hit you over the head with the obvious desperateness of their situation.  Being left alone with sharks is and would be terrifying.  The fact that sometimes the director's camera shows you the sharks, and other times you cannot see them adds to ""Open Water's"" frightening realism.  This movie is very reminiscent of the ""Blair Witch Project"" in terms of it's cinematography, but is much more realistic with regards to its subject matter.

Obviously, the biggest problem for our characters, are sharks.  There are sharks all around them, virtually from the moment they discover that they have ben stranded.  The interesting thing is that the sharks are displayed as simple inhabitants of the ocean, rather than ferocious killers, out to eat the poor humans.  It is also tense, becasue these are real sharks used in this film.  That is very ovbious from the first glimpse the viewer sees.I also enjoyed the different camera angles we see the shark at.  There are many shots that make the viewer feel as if they are wading in the ocean.This film was shot on digital camera and with a small budget, but the suspense and desparation needed to pull this film off are all very evident.The dialogue is a real waste and I didn;t care too much for the overall story or character development, but I suppose that these elements are not terribly critical in a movie like this.""Open Water"" is worth renting, then possibly buying.

858962,A2YFOLJQNPMQU6,B00064AE0G,Pedro Delgado,"[3, 5]","My brother hated this movie when he watched it at the theater.  He warned me not to bother spending any good movie on it, so I waited for its DVD release.  When I told him I had finally watched it, he just smiled at me and said, ""did you like it? ... my favorite part is when they are floating on the water!"".  I couldn't help but laugh... that pretty much describes it.I read the review below with the checklist.  Although it is a helpful guide, you should be aware that you can check all these and still come out not liking (or positively hating) the film.  I must say when I rented it, I was fully aware of what it was about.  I knew it was filmed in a grainy, documentary-style fashion.  I knew it has unknown actors for added cred.  I knew that the sharks where real.  I knew some of the hardships in filming it.  Most importantly, I knew that for a good 50 minutes or so, I would be looking at two people floating on the water.  This did not bother me.  In the end, what was dissapointing, and what I did NOT expect, was how little I cared by the end.I had been lead to believe by some of my friends (and by critics in many publications) that the drama in the movie was not entirely derived from the sharks, but that much of it depended on the complex interaction between the couple.  I was expecting a more meaningful exploration of male/female relationships than what I got.  To be honest, the human drama in the film was rather flat.  At no point was I really drawn in by the couple in the film... not by their pillow talk, not by their bickering over vacation plans, and ultimately not by their tragedy.  By the end, I simply did not care what happened to them.  The acting was bland, the dialogue was not intelligent, and the characters were not likeable (or even interesing).  When you have a film that consists of two characters floating in the ocean for almost 50 minutes, you should have all these elements present in order to keep the audieced tuned in.I did not hate the film as much as my brother did, but I certainly would not recommend it.  Sure, there are some genuinely frightful moments when the sharks attack, and the sequence at night is also somewhat disturbing.  But, for the most part, the film fails.  It did not deliver the emotional debt I would have expected.

So why it's overwhelmingly trashed on Amazon is a mystery.  Open Water is an exceptionally well-done low-budget indie starring unknowns and real scary sea creatures.  The creepy and unusual soundtrack is the perfect accompanyment.What was intended to be a stress-relieving trip to the Caribbean quickly turns into a young couple's worst nightmare when their dive boat leaves them stranded in open water. I had recently returned from the Bahamas on an identical trip when I saw this film.  There I learned this scenario of a dive boat taking off without someone, based on the true story of Tom and Eileen Lonergan, happens in real life more than you want to know, adding a horrifying layer of reality. The tourist industry does a good job of keeping this quiet.  It's easy to see how the head count can be screwed up on a crowded boat of strangers, bodies in constant motion, in and out of gear and in and out of the water.In his 2004 review of the film, ""A Mystery Resurfaces,"" critic Daniel Foggo writes:  ""It is chillingly authentic; all the more so because the lead actors, the relatively unknown Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis, spent more than 120 hours in the water 50 kilometres off Barbados amid all kinds of sea life, including the real bull sharks and grey reef sharks used in the scenes. Wearing chain mail under their wetsuits, the actors bobbed in the water while shark experts and the filmmakers manipulated their co-stars' movements by throwing chunks of bloody tuna near them.""The incessant waves filmed at eye-level is exactly what it looks like in open water miles from shore, emphasizing how impossible it is to keep your head entirely above surface even in calm seas. It's hard to tell from a quick glance at a dorsal fin whether it is a dolphin or a shark coming at you. Just dangling there even for a short while can be unnerving when there are plenty of sharks around and something keeps brushing your legs. Yech. This couple is left to drift in the ocean all day and all night, and through a thunderstorm, sharks circling.  The ending is poignant, unexpected, and memorable.

Great acting of the two main actors, who carry this film on their shoulders for more than an hour, mostly in cold waters, where all you can see is the shadow of sharks. The music keeps you on your toes. I found myself praying for their salvation. What a stupid way to ruin your life.This one is for people with a strong stomach. An untraditional Hollywood movie.Following this disturbing film, I contacted a friend diver, wondering whether the mistake that brought about this tragedy can happen in real life.In 1998, Tom and Eileen Lonergan disappeared off the Great Barrier Reef after a diving company accidentally left them behind in shark-infested waters. Their bodies were never found.They were planning to travel round the world before heading home, but first the couple were determined to visit the Barrier Reef. In Port Douglas, an upmarket diving and sailing town towards the end of the road north through Queensland, they decided to take a day trip on a 26-passenger boat, the Outer Edge. For A$160, the five crew would take them for three dives on the ribbon reefs, a stack of broad shoals that run along the seaward ramparts of the Barrier Reef, 40 miles offshore. On their third dive, round about 3pm, they headed off together and were last spotted swimming calmly 12m down. When they came to the surface after less than an hour underwater, the Outer Edge had gone.Being left behind on a dive is not an instant death sentence. Paul Lucas, a tourist from Leicester with less than 10 dives under his belt, survived for 40 hours in stormy seas in January 2000, after he was left behind by a dive boat in northern New South Wales. A diver is wearing an inflatable lifejacket and has the air to inflate it in a tank strapped to their back. The danger in the blazing heat of tropical Queensland is that, without fresh water, someone floating in the middle of the ocean may dehydrate long before help can arrive.The day after the incident the Outer Edge brought another tour party to the area, and one diver found six dive weights resting on the bottom. Oblivious to what had happened the previous day, a crew member described the find as a bonus.Inflatable dive jackets marked with Tom and Eileen's names were later washed ashore north of Port Douglas, along with their tanks - still buoyed up by a few remnants of air - and one of Eileen's fins. None showed any signs of the damage you would expect from a violent end, suggesting that the couple were not the victim of a shark attack, as the film suggests. Experts at the inquest speculated that, drifting helplessly back and forth on the tides in the building heat of the tropical sun, the couple may have been driven delirious by dehydration and have voluntarily struggled out of their cumbersome outfits. Without the buoyancy provided by their dive jackets and wetsuits, they would not have been able to tread water for long.The industry's damage-control mechanism was desperate and unpleasant. Rumours started spreading - many of them put about by the Outer Edge's owner, Tom Colrain - that there was more to the Lonergans' case than met the eye. Melancholy passages in the diaries of Tom and Eileen were raised as evidence that they had committed suicide, that he had killed her in a murder-suicide, even that they had faked their own deaths and sped off to a new life in another boat supposedly spotted nearby. Sightings of the Lonergans began pouring in from all over Australia.",4,keeps you on your toes,1291507200,"12 5, 2010",2010,3501,"['film', 'breath', 'away', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'Great', 'acting', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'who', 'carry', 'film', 'shoulders', 'more', 'hour', 'mostly', 'cold', 'waters', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'shadow', 'sharks', 'music', 'toes', 'found', 'praying', 'salvation', 'What', 'stupid', 'way', 'ruin', 'life.This', 'one', 'people', 'strong', 'stomach', 'untraditional', 'Hollywood', 'movie.Following', 'disturbing', 'film', 'contacted', 'friend', 'diver', 'wondering', 'mistake', 'brought', 'tragedy', 'can', 'happen', 'real', 'life.In', '1998', 'Tom', 'Eileen', 'Lonergan', 'disappeared', 'off', 'Great', 'Barrier', 'Reef', 'diving', 'company', 'accidentally', 'left', 'shark-infested', 'waters', 'bodies', 'were', 'never', 'found.They', 'were', 'planning', 'travel', 'world', 'heading', 'home', 'first', 'couple', 'were', 'determined', 'visit', 'Barrier', 'Reef', 'Port', 'Douglas', 'upmarket', 'diving', 'sailing', 'town', 'end', 'road', 'north', 'Queensland', 'decided', 'take', 'day', 'trip', '26-passenger', 'boat', 'Outer', 'Edge', '160', 'five', 'crew', 'would', 'take', 'three', 'dives', 'ribbon', 'reefs', 'stack', 'broad', 'shoals', 'run', 'seaward', 'ramparts', 'Barrier', 'Reef', '40', 'miles', 'offshore', 'third', 'dive', 'round', '3pm', 'headed', 'off', 'together', 'were', 'last', 'spotted', 'swimming', 'calmly', '12m', 'down', 'When', 'came', 'surface', 'less', 'hour', 'underwater', 'Outer', 'Edge', 'had', 'gone.Being', 'left', 'dive', 'not', 'instant', 'death', 'sentence', 'Paul', 'Lucas', 'tourist', 'Leicester', 'less', '10', 'dives', 'belt', 'survived', '40', 'hours', 'stormy', 'seas', 'January', '2000', 'was', 'left', 'behind', 'dive', 'boat', 'northern', 'New', 'South', 'Wales', 'diver', 'wearing', 'inflatable', 'lifejacket', 'air', 'inflate', 'tank', 'strapped', 'back', 'danger', 'blazing', 'heat', 'tropical', 'Queensland', 'fresh', 'water', 'someone', 'floating', 'middle', 'ocean', 'may', 'dehydrate', 'long', 'help', 'can', 'arrive.The', 'day', 'incident', 'Outer', 'Edge', 'brought', 'tour', 'party', 'area', 'one', 'diver', 'found', 'six', 'dive', 'weights', 'resting', 'bottom', 'Oblivious', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'previous', 'day', 'crew', 'member', 'described', 'find', 'bonus.Inflatable', 'dive', 'jackets', 'marked', 'Tom', 'Eileen', 'names', 'were', 'later', 'washed', 'ashore', 'north', 'Port', 'Douglas', 'tanks', 'still', 'buoyed', 'up', 'few', 'remnants', 'air', 'one', 'Eileen', 'fins', 'None', 'showed', 'signs', 'damage', 'would', 'expect', 'violent', 'end', 'suggesting', 'couple', 'were', 'not', 'victim', 'shark', 'attack', 'film', 'Experts', 'inquest', 'speculated', 'drifting', 'helplessly', 'back', 'forth', 'tides', 'building', 'heat', 'tropical', 'sun', 'couple', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'driven', 'delirious', 'dehydration', 'have', 'voluntarily', 'struggled', 'cumbersome', 'outfits', 'buoyancy', 'provided', 'dive', 'jackets', 'wetsuits', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'tread', 'water', 'long.The', 'industry', 'damage-control', 'mechanism', 'was', 'desperate', 'unpleasant', 'Rumours', 'started', 'spreading', 'many', 'put', 'Outer', 'Edge', 'owner', 'Tom', 'Colrain', 'was', 'more', 'Lonergans', 'case', 'met', 'eye', 'Melancholy', 'diaries', 'Tom', 'Eileen', 'were', 'raised', 'evidence', 'had', 'committed', 'suicide', 'had', 'killed', 'murder-suicide', 'even', 'had', 'faked', 'own', 'deaths', 'sped', 'off', 'new', 'life', 'boat', 'supposedly', 'spotted', 'nearby', 'Sightings', 'Lonergans', 'began', 'pouring', 'Australia']",N/A

Several reviewers here mentioned the ""Blair Witch Project"" and the WAY it was shot (cinematography). ""Open Water"" was shot in the same ""B-Movie"" vein. No soundtrack to speak of. No quality sound or even sound effects to speak of. Grainy images at times when the camera scrolls anywhere, as well as a somewhat bouncy camera from one scene to the next. The dialogue was hard to hear due to ocean water splashing and big rooms prone to echo. No big star names (not even small star names). Main characters Blanch Ryan and Dan Travis have all ready faded from sight. Eight (8) total cast members listed in the credits. 81 minutes long - and that includes the credits. Sure, ""Open Water"" relies on the primal fear that any human would have - being lost at sea (literally) and exposed (literally) to the harsh elements above and below the water. A ""fact based exercise""? Once the boat leaves in the first 1/3 of the movie, it's all up to the director as to what happens... for the 2 were never found and no one really knows what became of them. A few scenes will make you jump when a shark surfaces and splashes about. There's no blood and guts that you might expect from a shark-type thriller.

858978,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00064AE0G,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[7, 9]","Open Water (Chris Kentis, 2003)I did NOT see that ending coming.Chris Kentis' second feature film, made for a shoestring, ended up making just over thirty million in the theaters. A drop in the bucket for a Hollywood blockbuster, but thirty million for an indie flick about a couple of people stuck in the water? That's a smash hit, baby.Allegedly based on the true story of Tom and Eileen Lonergan, Open Water follows Susan Watkins (the gorgeous Blanchard Ryan, last seen in the execrable Super Troopers in a minor role) and her boyfriend Daniel Kintner (Daniel Travis, in his first screen appearance) as they take a vacation. Woo! Fun stuff. (The completely gratuitous nudity was probably meant to keep the audience interested before we get to the stuff you saw in the trailer. It worked.) Susan and Daniel head out for some scuba diving, but surface to discover that the boat has left without them, and spend the next twenty-four hours drifting through shark-infested waters trying to stay alive. (They must be in the Bermuda Triangle, because relatively early in the ordeal, a boat comes toward them. We cut to another scene, and when we come back, that boat is gone, and no mention of it is ever made again. Huh?)Open Water was marketed as a suspense thriller. Put that out of your head. If you want a good two-person suspense thriller, hunt down a copy of Radha Bharadwaj's amazing film Closetland. Open Water has far more in common (after the two get to drifting, anyway) with My Dinner with Andre. You've got two people and a lot of nothing else. What else are they going to do but talk?This, ultimately, is the film's shortcoming. In an eighty-minute film, we get roughly fifty minutes of Travis and Ryan floating around in the deep blue. Ask yourself: when was the last time you saw an eighty-minute film on the big screen? (The last one I can recall off the top of my head that wasn't animated was 1980's Motel Hell.) Ninety minutes is pretty much the lower limit these days. And this premise, as so ably shown by My Dinner with Andre, Closetland, and a handful of other two-person flicks, can easily be done, and done well, for longer than eighty minutes (or, actually, fifty in this movie). We get one tantalizing taste of what might have been when the two fall to accusing one another about whose fault it is that they're in this mess, but the rest of the script for the lost-in-the-ocean sequence might be a grand total of two pages long. It seems to be more an excuse for some interesting, if not overly beautiful, footage of things swimming around under the water and lot of shots of the empty horizon. Again, these are things that can work, given the right cinematographer. Here, they're all right, but nothing you can't see on the Discovery Channel.I'm not, by any means, saying not to see this movie. It's definitely worth a look, especially for those few times (the ending stands out here, in a huge way) Kentis overcomes his seeming fear of letting the actors do something really interesting. And it works, on some sort of primal level, in ways that many films aimed at disturbing the viewer do not. Maybe it's just because we're all, pretty much, afraid of sharks.

Zwick,"[4, 6]","***1/2Low-concept horror films have always worked better for me than high-concept ones - and you can't get much more low concept, or low-budget, than ""Open Water,""  a movie made on a digital cam for the whopping cost of $300,000.  A cinematic tour de force, ""Open Water"" takes a very plausible event from everyday life and uses it to show us just how vulnerable we are to the forces of nature and the exigencies of fate, becoming, in the process, a taut, disturbing thriller that haunts you long after the movie is over.Susan and Daniel are a yuppie couple who take a vacation to get away from the stresses and strains of their high pressured, workaholic lives.  When they go on a scuba diving expedition, they are accidentally left behind by the incompetent staff members of the company they've hired to take them out.  Cast adrift among schools of hungry sharks, Susan and Daniel can do little but float along helplessly, waiting for either salvation or doom to determine their fate.The movie has a rough-hewn look that separates it from the slick, plot-laden horror films made by mainstream studios.  The acting is also quite amateurish, although Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis seem to do a bit better while bobbing up and down in the water than while conversing on dry land.  In a lot of ways, though, the amateurism actually helps the movie seem more true-to-life and realistic.  Although the screenplay never spells the issues out explicitly, we sense that there's a strong undercurrent of troubled dissatisfaction running through the relationship.  This also adds to the human interest element of the story.Writer/director Chris Kentis resists the temptation to go over-the-top with elaborate special effects (which I'm sure he couldn't have afforded anyway) and contrived, in-the-nick-of-time rescues.  He allows the dread and nightmarish nature of the situation to insinuate itself into our bones and set our teeth on edge.  The suspense comes more from the anticipation of what might happen than from what actually does.  Of course, it helps that the sharks he shows us are real and not studio-manufactured facsimiles or the product of computer-generated graphics.This is the kind of homespun horror film, like ""The Blair Witch Project,"" that winds up with as many detractors as defenders among the genre's diehard aficionados.  Indeed, if you prefer your thrillers on the high-tech, over-plotted side, then ""Open Water"" may not be for you.

Schultz,"[5, 7]","When an acquaintance of mine became a widow, she said she felt as if she were rowing out to sea in a canoe, getting farther and farther from shore. This movie recalled that feeling to my mind. Open Water could serve as a metaphor for the human condition in general. It evokes a sense of each individual's essential aloneness and fragility in an unknowable vastness. So I found it to be more poignant than all the sophisticated abstractions of Brecht and the host of existential playwrights. This movie achieves its incidental commentary on the human condition with an absolutely simple, realistic premise.The story is loosely based on fact. A couple was left behind in the water when their diving excursion cruise ship pulled anchor and sailed back to port without them. This movie brings home to viewers what it must have been like to be left in such deadly abandonment.Open Water first delivers a lesson against even the most seemingly small lack of consideration for others. The couple couldn't have been left behind except for the loutish actions of another husband and wife on the cruise. This latter twosome boarded the boat after their dive and were counted as being back on deck. Then they returned to the water and allowed themselves to be counted A SECOND TIME when they made their final return to the ship's deck. Viewers will gasp when they see this small, but oh-so-fateful thoughtlessness. The crew, thinking they had ticked off the same number of people returning to deck who had dived off the deck - chugged obliviously back to port.When our protagonist couple bobbed up from the depths, somewhat late for their rendezvous with the ship, they found themselves alone in the Caribbean, out of range of any vessel. They proceed to go through the same sequence of emotions that Elizabeth Kubler-Ross outlined as the stages a person goes through after receiving a grim medical diagnosis.First comes denial. The couple denies the seriousness of their situation. Then their blithe reassurances crumble and are replaced by bitter accusations. They flail out in anger against each other. ""You should have..."" ""If only you hadn't..."" And finally, they draw back together in loving resignation during what they finally recognize could be their last hours.I think almost everyone watching this movie will be touched by this couple's plight and will identify with the drowning isolation they face. You will remember this movie - when you face the loss of a loved one, when you face a crisis of your own, when you stare up at the stars at night or look out over the waves of the ocean - whenever you feel small and alone and lost.",4,A Metaphor for the Human Condition,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,2632,"['When', 'acquaintance', 'mine', 'became', 'widow', 'said', 'felt', 'were', 'rowing', 'out', 'sea', 'canoe', 'getting', 'farther', 'farther', 'shore', 'movie', 'recalled', 'feeling', 'mind', 'Open', 'Water', 'could', 'serve', 'metaphor', 'human', 'condition', 'general', 'sense', 'individual', 'essential', 'aloneness', 'fragility', 'unknowable', 'vastness', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'poignant', 'sophisticated', 'abstractions', 'Brecht', 'host', 'existential', 'playwrights', 'movie', 'incidental', 'commentary', 'human', 'condition', 'absolutely', 'simple', 'realistic', 'premise.The', 'story', 'loosely', 'based', 'fact', 'couple', 'was', 'left', 'water', 'when', 'diving', 'excursion', 'cruise', 'ship', 'pulled', 'anchor', 'sailed', 'back', 'port', 'movie', 'home', 'viewers', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'be', 'left', 'such', 'deadly', 'abandonment.Open', 'Water', 'first', 'lesson', 'even', 'most', 'seemingly', 'small', 'lack', 'consideration', 'others', 'couple', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'left', 'behind', 'loutish', 'actions', 'husband', 'wife', 'cruise', 'latter', 'twosome', 'boarded', 'boat', 'dive', 'were', 'counted', 'being', 'back', 'deck', 'Then', 'returned', 'water', 'allowed', 'be', 'counted', 'SECOND', 'TIME', 'when', 'made', 'final', 'return', 'ship', 'deck', 'Viewers', 'will', 'gasp', 'when', 'see', 'small', 'oh-so-fateful', 'thoughtlessness', 'crew', 'thinking', 'had', 'ticked', 'off', 'same', 'number', 'people', 'returning', 'deck', 'who', 'had', 'dived', 'off', 'deck', 'chugged', 'obliviously', 'back', 'port.When', 'protagonist', 'couple', 'bobbed', 'up', 'depths', 'somewhat', 'late', 'rendezvous', 'ship', 'found', 'alone', 'Caribbean', 'range', 'vessel', 'proceed', 'go', 'same', 'sequence', 'emotions', 'Elizabeth', 'Kubler-Ross', 'outlined', 'stages', 'person', 'receiving', 'grim', 'medical', 'diagnosis.First', 'denial', 'couple', 'seriousness', 'situation', 'Then', 'blithe', 'reassurances', 'crumble', 'are', 'replaced', 'bitter', 'accusations', 'flail', 'out', 'anger', 'other', 'should', 'have', 'only', 'had', ""n't"", 'finally', 'draw', 'back', 'together', 'loving', 'resignation', 'what', 'finally', 'recognize', 'could', 'be', 'last', 'hours.I', 'think', 'almost', 'everyone', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'touched', 'couple', 'plight', 'will', 'identify', 'drowning', 'isolation', 'face', 'will', 'remember', 'movie', 'when', 'face', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'when', 'face', 'crisis', 'own', 'when', 'stare', 'up', 'stars', 'night', 'look', 'out', 'waves', 'ocean', 'whenever', 'feel', 'small', 'alone', 'lost']",N/A

My rating of this film however was not an option or I would have given it a negative five stars.I have a hard time just believing how the crew of the dive boat was portrayed. In all my diving I have been on boats with either efficient crews, or nonefficient crews. The crew in this is portrayed more like half efficient, likely to avoid fingers being pointed. Fact is, their absence should have been noticed. That is the responsibility of the dive master. Most I have been around check two to three times to see that everyone is back on board. Once when everyone has returned, Some do again before leaving the site, and then they check again at the docks. Unclaimed equipment/clothes is a dead giveaway and the crews and/or the dive master tend to stay on board until it is all claimed. A bad rep can destroy a charter company quick once word gets around.And you don't have to be out of country to find an inefficient crew either.

Left to drift in the sea, they hit upon the core of the movie - for all our pretensions and modern-day conveniences, a human being is a very small creature on a very big planet, and two people aren't much bigger.  To paraphrase Rick Blaine, ""The problems of two little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this world.""  So true.Be advised - this is not a ""shark movie"" along the lines of ""Jaws"" or ""Deep Blue Sea.""  Sharks play a vitally important role, but as the often-unseen object of terror, not as the set up of horrifying big-budget spectacle a la Quint sliding into the shark's mouth in ""Jaws.""  Indeed, there are dozens of sharks in ""Open Water,"" but they are reef sharks - there is nary a Great White or Tiger to be seen.This is the point of ""Open Water"" - a human being is not so significant that it takes the largest, meanest monster in the sea to take us out.  Instead, such forces as thirst, a stupid miscommunication, relatively small sharks, and a huge body of salt water are enough to drive us to terror and beyond.Made for a mere $130-odd thousand, ""Open Water"" is a no-frills movie.  David Mamet did not write the script - it goes for real-world truth rather than poetry or wit.  But as Susan and Daniel alternately complain, argue, love and support each other, you get the feeling that you really wouldn't be having a very different conversation if you were bobbing along at sea surrounded by a bunch of hungry little mouths.There are also virtually no clever camera tricks, but instead the movie uses camera angles and a few underwater shots to create a sense of foreboding and of genuine scares.  A late-night thunderstorm was enough to get the blood pumping!Long on gut reaction, short on virtually everything else, ""Open Water"" is a movie that makes you contemplate your place in the universe, and generally that contemplation isn't all that pleasant.  If you're looking for a big budget, jump-out-of-your-seat-at-set-pieces kind of picture, ""Open Water"" isn't for you.  If you want some spooky moments, genuine tension, and admire economical film-making, then ""Open Water"" is the movie for you.",4,"Low-budget, low concept, effective spine-tingler",1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,2926,"['Open', 'Water', 'sure', 'spark', 'strong', 'reactions', 'husband', 'wife', 'team', 'Chris', 'Kentis', 'Laura', 'Lau', 'did', 'virtually', 'everything', 'movie', 'act', 'nothing', 'else', 'production', 'chord', 'jangling', 'melodious', 'people.This', 'flick', 'yuppie', 'couple', 'Susan', 'Blanchard', 'Ryan', 'Daniel', 'Daniel', 'Travis', 'who', 'escape', 'yuppie', 'lives', 'particularly', 'Susan', 'cell', 'phone', 'quickie', 'vacation', 'islands', 'even', 'tropical', 'paradise', ""n't"", 'enough', 'two', 'one', 'scene', 'see', 'incredibly', 'naked', 'incredibly', 'attractive', 'bed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'muster', 'up', 'gumption', 'little', 'rumpy-pumpy', 'scene', 'whole', 'unnerving', 'mess', 'follow.The', 'next', 'day', 'go', 'scuba', 'diving', 'fail', 'get', 'picked', 'up', 'boat', 'Left', 'drift', 'sea', 'hit', 'core', 'movie', 'pretensions', 'modern-day', 'conveniences', 'human', 'being', 'very', 'small', 'creature', 'very', 'big', 'planet', 'two', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'bigger', 'paraphrase', 'Rick', 'Blaine', 'problems', 'two', 'little', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'amount', 'hill', 'beans', 'world', 'true.Be', 'advised', 'not', 'shark', 'movie', 'lines', 'Jaws', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'play', 'vitally', 'important', 'role', 'often-unseen', 'object', 'terror', 'not', 'set', 'horrifying', 'big-budget', 'spectacle', 'la', 'Quint', 'sliding', 'shark', 'mouth', 'Jaws', 'Indeed', 'are', 'dozens', 'sharks', 'Open', 'Water', 'are', 'reef', 'sharks', 'nary', 'Great', 'White', 'Tiger', 'be', 'seen.This', 'point', 'Open', 'Water', 'human', 'being', 'not', 'so', 'significant', 'largest', 'meanest', 'monster', 'sea', 'take', 'out', 'Instead', 'such', 'forces', 'thirst', 'stupid', 'miscommunication', 'relatively', 'small', 'sharks', 'huge', 'body', 'salt', 'water', 'are', 'enough', 'drive', 'terror', 'beyond.Made', 'mere', '130-odd', 'thousand', 'Open', 'Water', 'no-frills', 'movie', 'David', 'Mamet', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'script', 'real-world', 'truth', 'rather', 'poetry', 'wit', 'Susan', 'Daniel', 'alternately', 'complain', 'argue', 'love', 'support', 'other', 'get', 'feeling', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'having', 'very', 'different', 'conversation', 'were', 'bobbing', 'along', 'sea', 'surrounded', 'bunch', 'hungry', 'little', 'are', 'also', 'virtually', 'clever', 'camera', 'tricks', 'instead', 'movie', 'camera', 'angles', 'few', 'underwater', 'shots', 'create', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'genuine', 'scares', 'late-night', 'thunderstorm', 'was', 'enough', 'get', 'blood', 'pumping', 'Long', 'gut', 'reaction', 'short', 'virtually', 'everything', 'else', 'Open', 'Water', 'movie', 'contemplate', 'place', 'universe', 'generally', 'contemplation', ""n't"", 'pleasant', ""'re"", 'looking', 'big', 'budget', 'jump-out-of-your-seat-at-set-pieces', 'kind', 'picture', 'Open', 'Water', ""n't"", 'want', 'spooky', 'moments', 'genuine', 'tension', 'admire', 'economical', 'film-making', 'then', 'Open', 'Water', 'movie']",N/A

I think the movie is essentially a documentary rather than a feature film. If you watch it with a documentary perspective, then the simple cast, simple dialogs and shaky camera won't bother you too much.The story is really simple. A couple out to a scuba diving vacation and a careless mistake on part of the tour operator leaves them stranded in the open sea. Some things that I really liked about the movie are:1. The dialogs are very real and simple. You can almost relate to the characters in the movie.2. The couple's reluctance to believe that they have been stranded in the open water is very real. They cling to the hope that the tour boat will come and pick them up. This behavior is very real.3. The minor scuffle that the couple has in the wake of their situation is very real. Such scuffles are a natural way to vent fear and frustation.4. The husband's demise and the way the wife lets go of him is very poignant and the way she herself succumbs to the open water will leave your eyes moist.There was no witness to the tragedy and hence some scenes are based on the director's imagination. I think he has done a wonderful job. I'd compare it to Sebastian Jung's Perfect Storm. His book was based on a lot of alleged information. People really liked thaht book.

The themes of isolation and unseen horror are floating along with the divers in this 81 minutes of HORROR. Anyone who did not think this was a horror movie is simply not as afraid of water as I am. Most horror films prey on being afraid of the dark. If you have only this juvenile fear, the night scene alone should scare the flippers off you. Contrary to what the other reviewers here would have you believe, there are quite a few scenes where there are sharks seen in the water, of fins gliding by in the distance, and of fins clashing together in close frame as two sharks dive out of and into the water so close together that their fins hit - IF you are paying attention, which some of the reviewers simply were not. The idea of a shark sliding by and zipping a leg off is terrifying. They can cut you in half at the middle so fast that you are still alive long enough to look down and see that half of your body is gone. That the divers feel fish biting at their legs or jelly fish are stinging them with like what feels like a fist hitting or they fall asleep and wake up alone or something hits them in the back and almost knocks them over, these things are so terrifying because they do not know what is happening under the water. That they are kept in constant fear can certainly sustain 81 minutes. Whether they are Great Barrier Reef sharks or Mako sharks or Great Whites, they all have something in common - rows of razor sharp teeth that keep on replacing themselves. I had a sense, the first time I saw it, that they would be saved, and that heightened my shock at the ending. I felt a sense of affrontery. The yellow camera, tethered to Daniel, was in view all through the film. It is marked on the IMBd website that the camera being pulled out of the shark's belly at the end is a piece of trivia! Far from a piece of trivia, this is one of the ways they found out who the divers were and what happened to them. (The other way was was the guy finding their diving certificates with their other belongings on the boat.) The shark was shown to eat the camera during the film; so how can it be mere trivia? I think people just do not want to admit how clever Chris Kentis was when he wrote the script and filmed the shark scenes. If you do not have the DVD, get it so that you can see the 'making of' video! Get it so that you can see the actors among REAL Great Barrier Reef Sharks. I guess that the negative reviewers do not want to admit how great this film is; I guess the landlubber film-goers just want to seem like they are above being afraid of sharks.

858999,A28364B5MYR96B,B00064AE0G,"Sonny ""BCAT""","[6, 7]","Open Water is a low-budget film.  This aides more than hinders the efforts of the filmmakers, ensuring that we do not recognize personalities so that we have no preconceived notions of the actors that are performing or the story that is unfolding.  The digital video gives it a documentary feel and everything that happens supports that.  The fact that the story is basically nonexistent also supports the films intentions.  We are privy to an extended period of the lives of two people we do not know, trapped in an impossible, and terrifying sitaution.  When the sharks are swimming around these people we perceive this as real (and it in fact is) and not some Hollywood robot.  The danger is always imminent, even when the sharks are unseen.The idea here is not to pull at your heartstrings, or to immerse in some deeply involved story.  It is solely to allow you to experience the primal horror of a situation that is conceivably plausable.  The actors are not famous because the filmmakers want us to know that it could be any one of us stuck in the water with the sharks, not Kevin Costner or Ashley Judd.  With personalities like that no one would ever believe that something bad would happen to them.  The actors, Blanchard Ryan and Travis Bickle (who acquit themselves admirably among the toughest of working conditions), allow the viewer to bob up and down in the water with them.Toward the end of the film, there is a scene that takes place during the night, after a bite, with the only light afforded to the couple coming from the random bolts of lightning crashing loudly as the sharks swarm.  This scene is among the most frightnening I have ever seen, and will not leave my memory anytime soon.If you enjoy squirming in your bed, or hunching yourself on the edge of the sofa, give Open Water a try, and then cancel your caribbean vacation when the credits roll.",4,Truly frightening!,1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,1876,"['Open', 'Water', 'low-budget', 'film', 'more', 'hinders', 'efforts', 'filmmakers', 'ensuring', 'do', 'not', 'recognize', 'personalities', 'have', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'actors', 'are', 'performing', 'story', 'unfolding', 'digital', 'video', 'documentary', 'feel', 'everything', 'supports', 'fact', 'story', 'basically', 'nonexistent', 'also', 'films', 'intentions', 'are', 'privy', 'extended', 'period', 'lives', 'two', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'trapped', 'impossible', 'terrifying', 'sitaution', 'When', 'sharks', 'are', 'swimming', 'people', 'perceive', 'real', 'fact', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'robot', 'danger', 'always', 'imminent', 'even', 'when', 'sharks', 'are', 'unseen.The', 'idea', 'here', 'not', 'pull', 'heartstrings', 'immerse', 'deeply', 'involved', 'story', 'solely', 'allow', 'experience', 'primal', 'horror', 'situation', 'conceivably', 'plausable', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'famous', 'filmmakers', 'want', 'know', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'stuck', 'water', 'sharks', 'not', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'personalities', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'believe', 'something', 'bad', 'would', 'happen', 'actors', 'Blanchard', 'Ryan', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'who', 'acquit', 'admirably', 'toughest', 'working', 'conditions', 'allow', 'viewer', 'bob', 'up', 'down', 'water', 'them.Toward', 'end', 'film', 'scene', 'place', 'night', 'bite', 'only', 'light', 'afforded', 'couple', 'coming', 'random', 'bolts', 'lightning', 'crashing', 'loudly', 'sharks', 'swarm', 'scene', 'most', 'frightnening', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'will', 'not', 'leave', 'memory', 'anytime', 'enjoy', 'squirming', 'bed', 'hunching', 'edge', 'sofa', 'give', 'Open', 'Water', 'try', 'then', 'cancel', 'caribbean', 'vacation', 'when', 'credits', 'roll']",N/A

The low budget filming distracted me and I just couldn't really settle down and really enjoy it.Two of the 20 people were left in the ocean after a certified diver miscounted when the people got back on the boat after a morning of diving.  Countless hours of floating in the water, with boats too far away to see them as they past by, eventually left the two feeling helpless and forced them to realize their fate.  They strayed and that was their bad.  You mean to tell me that the people who orchestrated the diving trip only did one dive a day??

A few hours later, other fish began to knaw at them.  They had an argument as to whose fault it was that they were in this 'watery' predicament which in my opinion could've been left out.  A few more hours later, after sharks floated around them here and there, one decided to bit the dude.  There is no way that sharks will just bump you here and there and then decide to get you.  Not realistic.  A few more hours later, dude dies, I assume from bleeding, and his girlfriend is left to fend for herself.

859008,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B00064AE0G,Terry Mesnard,"[4, 4]","Yet another movie that was marketedly poorly and so received poor reviews from people expecting something different.This isn't Jaws.  It doesn't try to be and it shouldn't be compared to Jaws.  It involves sharks but the real fear, the real tenseness stems from not knowing what's around you.  The fear of the unknown is one of the biggest of mankind, as is evidenced in many many movies.  And, for me, there's nothing scarier than being trapped out at sea, slowly being pulled away from humanity and everything it stands for and finally not knowing what's around you.  It's a helpless situation.  What can you really do?  You can't drink the water, you can't swim toward land when land is not in sight.  No one sees you and oh did I mention there's a fin passing by you every so often?  For me, this movie had a knot in my stomache from the very first moment they realize they are stranded to the last shot.It doesn't have much action in it, true, but the feeling of being totally alone except for each other lends believability to their own internal dramas.  And that is, at the heart, what this movie is:  a drama.  Through all 79 minutes of the film, it is a detioriation of a married couple's lives.  They go through all the stages, bickering, acceptance, anger, fear, distrust, etc.  And, through their internal drama, we learn of their lives.  My one complaint for this approach is that I would have liked a little more time before them being stranded so I could get a better look at their life.As for the movie being based on a true story, it sort of is.  It's based on actual accounts of people being left at sea after going on diving expeditions.  This actually happens, not frequently, but the fact that it does happen is creepy enough to give me cause to pause.  I don't think I would ever go off shore diving after seeing this movie.Another interesting note that really doesn't serve much purpose to the plot of the film is that the actors were really in the water with real sharks.  On the first day of shooting, the female star actually was bitten by a barricuda.

The basic flaw here - and the one that ultimately sinks this movie - is that two people floating around in the ocean is BORING, sharks or no sharks.  The first time the sharks show up, it gets your attention.  The tenth time, you're thinking, ""Sharks. Danger.  I get it.""  I didn't care whether these characters lived or died, which is essential to a movie like this.  I realized after watching this that it is impossible to make floating in the ocean into compelling cinema.  I kept waiting for the movie to kick into high gear, but it never did.  I left asking, ""Is that it?!""  What made Jaws so great was that it was less about a shark than about carefully-drawn characters we could identify with and relate to.

""Based on a true story""? The writer does admit to seeing a story in a newspaper about a couple who had been left behind due to the miscount by the dive boat. Nothing else is given about it, and even that, on the DVD, is hard to locate. I was shocked to hear it was only 79 minutes - felt like 3 hours. I was impressed with the sunrise and sunset. Had a plug for Discovery Channel. No redeeming value at all. Was called a Suspense Drama. Neither were evident in the film. Rated R for Language and Nudity. Well, the language may have been there, but I can't remember it. As far as the nudity goes, yes there was about 4 minutes of titillation, but fizzled out. For Mother Nature breaks we paused the film, really afraid to miss out if there were any good parts, but unfortunately there were none.

859015,A1NSRNG8YNTHXP,B00064AE0G,TheXRAYest,"[3, 6]","After all the hype surrounding this film, I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD at the local rental store, as I love a good shark flick and actually plan one of my summer vacation weeks around ""Shark Week""on the Discovery Channel. To say we were disappointed does not even come close to saying it all. From the very beginning the film seemed cheaply made and I thought from the very opening that it appeared made with a camcorder. The sound was terrible (almost ""tinny""), the dialoge laughable, the characters annoying. The 3 seconds of nudity was not necessary and would have been 100 improved even if the actress had a decent pair of [...] on. As far as foul language, we must have missed that because upon round one of viewing this waste, we didn't recall any swearing, and I will never watch it again to try to pick out parts that I may have missed the first time.With that said, the fact that it was based somewhat on a true story was the most horrific part of the film. I cannot believe there are such idiots out there in the world that are allowed to run a business (as in the boat charter), that have such a poor system of keeping track of their guests. The guy playing ""Junior"" must have had the mentality of a 2 year old. Perhaps the dude who played the obnoxious jerk on the boat threw off ""Juniors"" tracking skills with his annoying banter. The movie would have been better had the sharks enjoyed a meal of the jerk, however even the sharks have more taste than that. That aside, I further found it hard to believe that NO ONE on the boat noticed that the couple were not back on the boat for the return trip, and no one at the very least counted the dive tanks after the trip to make sure all were accounted for !!!??? Gee, that would have taken all of 10 minutes. Are people that wrapped up in themselves? I mean the boat only had 23 people on it, not 100 ! Come on. I don't know but when you run a charter boat/scuba diving business where there is the possibilty of danger, maybe being conscientious ALL THE TIME might be a good idea. Accidents happen, someone may tragically drown or get the ""bends"", but being left behind in shark infested waters is not just due to lack of good judgement. I'm sure ""Davis"" would be panicing had he been left behind also with his 2 trusting, paying customers.Okay so then the 2 stranded divers bob about in the ocean chatting about this and that, one vomits, they both urinate (oh, ""at least it makes a warm spot in the water for a few seconds""), see several boats that of course do not see them nor do they attempt to swim to, they encounter various sea life and then the sharks start to circle about. Now the premise is terrifing, and at that point I tried to put myself in that situation and suffice it to say I would be terrified beyond hope. So the concept was scary basically when I tried to relate to the situation.Then it appears the moron boat owner has an epiphany when he finds the divers left behind equipment on his boat and alerts the powers that be many hours later. Now at least I am thinking, thank heavens these two will be found alive, probably scarred for live and in need of medical and psychological care, but still alive. Next night falls, and as dawn approaches it appears that Dan is no longer among the living as Sue still clings to his lifeless body. Then she just lets go of him as if he is some sacrifice to the sharks (or more likely, breakfast). At this point I still have hope that she will be rescued and when the film ends as it does, I am left in absolute disbelief.To say this film was terrible is being too kind. I also played the director commentaries and after listening to the mindless drivel coming from Chris Kentis and his incredibly bland, boring, and overly enthusiastic wife (and assistant), it was no wonder why this films stunk so bad. I hope neither one paid good money for a higher education in film making as this film lacks professionalism. It's basically another scam with the likes of the other horror is is compared to, ""Blair Witch Project"", which was the first worst movie that I ever saw. This bomb wins the second worst. The only good thing that I can say is that rather than paying theater prices to see this waste of time, I rented it for less than $5 and watched it with a group of 5 friends, so at least we only put a dollar a piece in Kentis' pocket.[...]",1,Our rating = 2 THUMBS DOWN !!!,1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,4373,"['hype', 'surrounding', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'local', 'rental', 'store', 'love', 'good', 'shark', 'flick', 'actually', 'plan', 'one', 'summer', 'vacation', 'weeks', 'Shark', 'Week', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'say', 'were', 'disappointed', 'not', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'saying', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'seemed', 'cheaply', 'made', 'thought', 'very', 'opening', 'appeared', 'made', 'camcorder', 'sound', 'was', 'terrible', 'almost', 'tinny', 'dialoge', 'laughable', 'characters', 'annoying', '3', 'seconds', 'nudity', 'was', 'not', 'necessary', 'would', 'have', 'been', '100', 'improved', 'even', 'actress', 'had', 'decent', 'pair', '[', ']', 'As', 'far', 'foul', 'language', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'round', 'one', 'viewing', 'waste', 'did', ""n't"", 'recall', 'swearing', 'will', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'try', 'pick', 'out', 'parts', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'first', 'time.With', 'said', 'fact', 'was', 'based', 'somewhat', 'true', 'story', 'was', 'most', 'horrific', 'part', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'are', 'such', 'idiots', 'out', 'there', 'world', 'are', 'allowed', 'run', 'business', 'boat', 'charter', 'have', 'poor', 'system', 'keeping', 'track', 'guests', 'guy', 'playing', 'Junior', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'mentality', '2', 'year', 'old', 'Perhaps', 'dude', 'who', 'played', 'obnoxious', 'jerk', 'boat', 'threw', 'off', 'Juniors', 'tracking', 'skills', 'annoying', 'banter', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'sharks', 'enjoyed', 'meal', 'jerk', 'however', 'even', 'sharks', 'have', 'more', 'taste', 'aside', 'further', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'ONE', 'boat', 'noticed', 'couple', 'were', 'not', 'back', 'boat', 'return', 'trip', 'one', 'very', 'least', 'counted', 'dive', 'tanks', 'trip', 'make', 'sure', 'were', 'accounted', 'Gee', 'would', 'have', 'taken', '10', 'minutes', 'Are', 'people', 'wrapped', 'up', 'mean', 'boat', 'only', 'had', '23', 'people', 'not', '100', 'Come', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'run', 'charter', 'boat/scuba', 'diving', 'business', 'where', 'possibilty', 'danger', 'maybe', 'being', 'conscientious', 'TIME', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'Accidents', 'happen', 'someone', 'may', 'tragically', 'drown', 'get', 'bends', 'being', 'left', 'shark', 'infested', 'waters', 'not', 'just', 'due', 'lack', 'good', 'judgement', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Davis', 'would', 'be', 'panicing', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'also', '2', 'trusting', 'paying', 'customers.Okay', 'so', 'then', '2', 'stranded', 'divers', 'bob', 'ocean', 'chatting', 'one', 'vomits', 'urinate', 'oh', 'least', 'warm', 'spot', 'water', 'few', 'seconds', 'see', 'several', 'boats', 'course', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'do', 'attempt', 'swim', 'encounter', 'various', 'sea', 'life', 'then', 'sharks', 'start', 'circle', 'Now', 'premise', 'terrifing', 'point', 'tried', 'put', 'situation', 'suffice', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'terrified', 'hope', 'concept', 'was', 'scary', 'basically', 'when', 'tried', 'relate', 'situation.Then', 'moron', 'boat', 'owner', 'epiphany', 'when', 'divers', 'left', 'behind', 'equipment', 'boat', 'powers', 'be', 'many', 'hours', 'later', 'Now', 'least', 'am', 'thinking', 'thank', 'heavens', 'two', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'alive', 'probably', 'scarred', 'live', 'need', 'medical', 'psychological', 'care', 'still', 'alive', 'Next', 'night', 'falls', 'dawn', 'Dan', 'no', 'longer', 'living', 'Sue', 'still', 'lifeless', 'body', 'Then', 'just', 'go', 'sacrifice', 'sharks', 'more', 'likely', 'breakfast', 'point', 'still', 'have', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'rescued', 'when', 'film', 'am', 'left', 'absolute', 'disbelief.To', 'say', 'film', 'was', 'terrible', 'being', 'too', 'kind', 'also', 'played', 'director', 'commentaries', 'listening', 'mindless', 'drivel', 'coming', 'Chris', 'Kentis', 'incredibly', 'bland', 'boring', 'overly', 'enthusiastic', 'wife', 'assistant', 'was', 'wonder', 'why', 'stunk', 'so', 'bad', 'hope', 'one', 'paid', 'good', 'money', 'higher', 'education', 'film', 'making', 'film', 'professionalism', 'basically', 'scam', 'likes', 'other', 'horror', 'compared', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'was', 'first', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'saw', 'bomb', 'second', 'worst', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'rather', 'paying', 'theater', 'prices', 'see', 'waste', 'time', 'rented', 'less', '5', 'watched', 'group', '5', 'friends', 'so', 'least', 'only', 'put', 'dollar', 'piece', 'Kentis', 'pocket.', '[', ']']",N/A

859019,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00064AE0G,Tim Janson,"[8, 9]","Open Water is NOT a big budgeted Hollywood movie.  This is something that must be understood from the get go.  This is only director Chris Kentis' second feature film.  It was the first film for it's male lead Daniel Travis and the first starring role for female lead Blanchard Ryan.  Moreover the film has the look and feel of a documentary in the way it's filmed.  The sound is uneven in spots causing you to have to turn the volume up quite a bit higher than normal.  So these things must be understood because they are certain to put off people who are used to much more polished looking films.Susan and Daniel are a yuppie (is that still a valid term?) couple with hectic lives who take a rather rushed vacation to the caribbean.  While there they take a scuba diving trip along with several other people.  The organizers screw up the head count and when Daniel and Susan return to the surface they find that their boat has left them all alone in the middle of the ocean.  This certainly plays upon one of man's primal fears; the thought of being lost in the middle of nowhere.  To compound matters, sharks are swimming about and Susan has motion sickness from the choppy waters.After several hours on the water the pair begin a somewhat contrived argument over whose fault it is that they are in the situation.  It ends as quickly as it was thrown in however.  And it has the feel of a toss away plot device to add a bit of meat to the barebones plot.It's a short film and certainly doesn't end the way most people would think.  It's a rather voyeuristic character study as we glimpse at two people so wrapped up in their own lives that they don't realize they are both to blame.  The performances are strong and the style of direction and filming give it an edge that would be lost with a larger budget.

There were two people floating and bobbing and suffering and being circled by sharks, wearing diving gear, but that's about all the diving you'd see.  Their dive boat incredibly didn't notive they were missing and sailed off, never to return, and for the rest of the movie all you see is these two people floating and starving and being miserable.And then -- spoiler alert: don't read further if you might actually entertain the misbegotten urge to make yourself suffer by watching this hideous trash -- they both die.

859023,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00064AE0G,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 6]","First, let me say one thing.  If 'Open Water' had been released as small art-house film, I would have given it more than three stars.  The story about the two divers left in the middle of ocean is intriguing, and the film surely gives some very tense moments.  But I couldn't finally come to like it, and let me tell you the reasons as below.[TOO MUCH HYPE] What I really hate is not the film itself, but the way it was promoted.  At the beginning of the film they claim it is 'Based on the Real Events,' but the fact is, the film's script is mostly based on pure speculation about the real-life husband and wife who went missing mysteriously.  (I don't buy the idea that the scuba-diving people are so poor at counting the heads on the boat).But many films do the same thing, you might say.  Sure, but in addition to that, 'Open Water' tries to emulate 'Jaws,' which of course is not.  By repeatedly proclaiming that they 'used' real sharks, the film is desperately trying to lead us to think that the sharks would provide good thrills.  However, they simply don't because of the poorly-shot sequences, unexceptional dialogues, and not-so-good acting like three principals in 'Blair Witch Project.'  As to the sharks again, though the shark in 'Jaws' is obviously a fake, it had a real trained professional actors like Robert Shaw.If you still don't like my comments, how about this?  The film contains nudity (of the leading actress who bears her breasts in bed) while there is no need for that.  Why include nudity  when sharks would suffice to fill in the 79 minute film?  Why the unnecessary, very nasty end-credit sequences in which something is suggested?  To me, as I remember many 70s films, 'Open Water' looks like one of the exploitation films that appeared on the screen at that time.  'Open Water' is entertaining, and would be a nice choice if you watch it on DVD, but it does not deserve the box-office figures all around the world, or the accolades heaped on it by the critics.",2,"Fairly Entertaining, But Does Not Deserve the Hype",1119657600,"06 25, 2005",2005,1993,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'one', 'thing', ""'Open"", 'Water', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'small', 'art-house', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'three', 'stars', 'story', 'two', 'divers', 'left', 'middle', 'ocean', 'intriguing', 'film', 'surely', 'very', 'tense', 'moments', 'could', ""n't"", 'finally', 'come', 'like', 'let', 'tell', 'reasons', 'below', '[', 'TOO', 'MUCH', 'HYPE', ']', 'What', 'really', 'hate', 'not', 'film', 'way', 'was', 'promoted', 'beginning', 'film', 'claim', ""'Based"", 'Real', 'Events', 'fact', 'film', 'script', 'mostly', 'based', 'pure', 'speculation', 'real-life', 'husband', 'wife', 'who', 'went', 'missing', 'mysteriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'idea', 'scuba-diving', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'poor', 'counting', 'heads', 'boat', '.But', 'many', 'films', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'might', 'say', 'Sure', 'addition', ""'Open"", 'Water', 'tries', 'emulate', ""'Jaws"", 'course', 'not', 'repeatedly', 'proclaiming', ""'used"", 'real', 'sharks', 'film', 'desperately', 'trying', 'lead', 'think', 'sharks', 'would', 'provide', 'good', 'thrills', 'However', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'poorly-shot', 'sequences', 'unexceptional', 'dialogues', 'not-so-good', 'acting', 'three', 'principals', ""'Blair"", 'Witch', 'Project', 'sharks', 'again', 'shark', ""'Jaws"", 'obviously', 'fake', 'had', 'real', 'trained', 'professional', 'actors', 'Robert', 'Shaw.If', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'comments', 'how', 'film', 'nudity', 'leading', 'actress', 'who', 'breasts', 'bed', 'need', 'Why', 'include', 'nudity', 'when', 'sharks', 'would', 'suffice', 'fill', '79', 'minute', 'film', 'Why', 'unnecessary', 'very', 'nasty', 'end-credit', 'sequences', 'something', 'suggested', 'remember', 'many', '70s', 'films', ""'Open"", 'Water', 'looks', 'one', 'exploitation', 'films', 'appeared', 'screen', 'time', ""'Open"", 'Water', 'entertaining', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'choice', 'watch', 'DVD', 'not', 'deserve', 'box-office', 'figures', 'world', 'accolades', 'heaped', 'critics']",N/A

When I went to the theatre I saw a tagline on the movie's poster that said something like &#34;Based on a True Story.&#34; After seeing the movie, I chuckled to myself because I thought that tag line was part of the BLAIR WITCH type hype that was surrounding the movie. Later, I discovered that the tag line wasn't just a gimmick, because the movie really is based upon the true story of Tom and Eileen Lonergan who disappeared in a very similar fashion off the Great Barrior Reef in 1998.OPEN WATER is not a great movie, but it is a fairly good one. Considering the low budget and that the movie stars no big names whatsoever with a director that hardly anyone has ever heard of before, it's an extraordinary accomplishment. The acting in the film is very realistic and fits in with the grainy, home-movie feel. The editing and direction are also well done, e.g. the audience is given a break from the tension in the ocean with interspersed shots of the exotic locale that the movie's main characters, Daniel and Susan, were vacationing at. The sharks are kind of nice to look at too because they are real. In addition, the build up of the characterization between Daniel and Susan as they flounder deeper and deeper into the ocean works wonderfully.OPEN WATER's major flaw is that the film's conclusion is forgone before Daniel and Susan even leave their home. The movie is also only about 75 minutes in length. Therefore, there really isn't much movie here and it leaves the audience wondering &#34;Is that all?&#34;Still, everything the movie does get right balances out many of the negatives. It's better than THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, but not as good as JAWS.",3,"Well Done Low-Budget Film With Not Much ""Umph""",1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,1765,"['went', 'see', 'OPEN', 'WATER', 'friend', 'mine', 'told', 'real', 'sharks', 'were', 'used', 'filming', 'When', 'went', 'theatre', 'saw', 'tagline', 'movie', 'poster', 'said', 'something', '34', 'Based', 'True', 'Story.', '34', 'seeing', 'movie', 'chuckled', 'myself', 'thought', 'tag', 'line', 'was', 'part', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'type', 'hype', 'was', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'Later', 'discovered', 'tag', 'line', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'gimmick', 'movie', 'really', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Tom', 'Eileen', 'Lonergan', 'who', 'disappeared', 'very', 'similar', 'fashion', 'Great', 'Barrior', 'Reef', '1998.OPEN', 'WATER', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'fairly', 'good', 'one', 'Considering', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'big', 'names', 'whatsoever', 'director', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'ever', 'heard', 'before', 'extraordinary', 'accomplishment', 'acting', 'film', 'very', 'realistic', 'fits', 'grainy', 'home-movie', 'feel', 'editing', 'direction', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'e.g', 'audience', 'given', 'break', 'tension', 'ocean', 'interspersed', 'shots', 'exotic', 'locale', 'movie', 'main', 'characters', 'Daniel', 'Susan', 'were', 'vacationing', 'sharks', 'are', 'kind', 'nice', 'look', 'too', 'are', 'real', 'addition', 'build', 'characterization', 'Daniel', 'Susan', 'flounder', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'ocean', 'wonderfully.OPEN', 'WATER', 'major', 'flaw', 'film', 'conclusion', 'forgone', 'Daniel', 'Susan', 'even', 'leave', 'home', 'movie', 'also', 'only', '75', 'minutes', 'length', 'Therefore', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'movie', 'here', 'audience', 'wondering', '34', '34', 'Still', 'everything', 'movie', 'get', 'right', 'balances', 'out', 'many', 'negatives', 'better', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'JAWS']",N/A

Unfortunately Open Water succeeds only in reminding you of how much better those two movies are in comparison.The first thing you'll notice is the photography, such as it were. It looks like it was filmed on the handicam your slightly drunk uncle waves around at family get togethers. I know full well this was done intentionally to achieve a ""reality TV"" type effect, but that doesn't change the fact that it looks and sounds like crap. Sure, the Blair Witch used video cameras and amateurish camera work, but it was rationalized within the framework of the story---we were supposed to be watching the footage shot by the characters themselves (and even then, the use of black and white, and the natural foreboding ambience of the woods provided some haunting imagery.) Open Water does not use the narrative gimmick of showing ""actual footage"" captured by the characters on their own cameras--its just inexplicably ugly and cheap. And if they were going for a ""reality"" vibe, why are there several instances of music added over the soundtrack?The acting and writing is weak. You never once  believe these are real people acting spontaneously...every line rings hollow. For the bulk of the film we are watching two characters, a husband and wife, floating in the sea, and the opportunity is certainly there for some dramatic soul bearing, but instead they just alternate between whining and smarm.Things start to pick up when night falls and we must rely on our ears while looking at a black screen (a similar ""blackout"" effect was used in the Blair Witch, and also older films such as Wait Until Dark and The Tingler). Unfortunately the scene is marred with poorly executed ""lightning flashes"", achieved by turning the image brightness up and down quickly. It looks fake and sabotages the one chance this film had to really lay on the scares.About the only positive thing I can say about Open Water is they used real divers in a real ocean with real sharks, which lends some much needed believability to this cheesefest. Of course if I want real sharks, I'll turn on Discovery Channel.If nothing else this film marks a new low in what is considered acceptable fare in mainstream movie theaters.

Immediately this movie has certain tags applied to it that must be fullfilled or else the viewers walk away disappointed. One may be expecting certain traits of the movie that it does not have and miss out on what makes it very strong. This could be the case with 'Open Water'. While it will probably be more respected as time goes on and tags are abandoned, for right now this is a tightly woven picture that probably will not fullfill most expectations. It is not great by any means, and at times does not look good, but primarily because it attempts to be as authentic as possible. It appears as though the glamour was abandoned in favor of the cinematic effect-a respectable attribute of the film. It is paced evenly throughout which kept me from becoming bored. There is a buildup that one may or may not feel, but will realize at the end of the picture whilst emerged in the final scene. The scariest part of the movie could have been longer, but it is effective in keeping the movie going, and ultimately arriving at its climax.

Then it gets even more weird and depressing as the couple get into it with each other as they fight for their lives in the middle of the engulfing ocean.  It was actually intriguing to watch as they go through each trail and tribulation as the clock remains ticking.  It did get me and my boyfriend talking about what we would do in their place.  (It's interesting to hear what the person you love says they would do in a situation like that).  It's the kind of stuff that could make or break a relationship.  This movie does provide open doors to communication and you end up having discussions like ""would you react like that to me if we were in extreme crisis etc...""  So if you don't want to get too ""deep"", you're better off watching ""Jaws 3"".  One thing I ended up regreting was when I left the video store I jokingly said ""I hope they both die at the end"".  I recalled hearing about this story in the past and was under the impression they survived, why else would Hollywood make such a movie then?
