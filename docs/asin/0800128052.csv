162546,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,0800128052,absent_minded_prof,"[0, 0]","This was the first movie I ever bought.  Really good stuff, in a number of ways.  One of the more difficult issues, the issue of his hometown love interest, is dealt with very well.  It could be shown as a minor subplot, but they do a good job with it.  I am reminded of the love-story element to &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot; -- if you have found love, and the peace that goes with it, at what point do you stop seeking more in your life, in other ways?But the main thing here is Rudy's bulldog determination to keep moving forward.  I cried watching this.  He just keeps asking &quot;Have I done all that I can do?&quot; again and again, every time he hits an obstacle.  I can't even believe this is a true story.  If they had a Nobel prize for Human Spirit, this guy would have my vote.Supporting character actors all do a good job here.  Even the sleazeball older brother seems to have some character development by the end.  Rudy's buddy who wants to be a lawyer is hilarious, and the groundskeeper who helps out unobtrusively is inspiring, as an example of how we can all help one another in small, invisible ways.  Just a totally great movie in all ways.  If you think it's too melodramatic, or simplistic, then face it, you are too sophisticated, and you need to get back in touch with whatever your inner dreams are, or ever were.

162554,AK6UVFSU07NXH,0800128052,Anthony Hinde,"[2, 2]","Rudy is based on a true story. In a sense it is about the struggle to break out of one's class. But I prefer to think of it as a vivid example of what can be achieved through pure dedication to a goal.Rudy  Ruettiger, played by Sean Astin, is one of many children born into a lower  class family of steel mill workers. Not surprisingly the family is devoted  to football, specifically the team from their local university, Notre Dame.  Sprouting from this base of economic hardship and team idolatry, a dream is  born. Rudy, at a very young age, makes up his mind that he will one day  play on his families favourite team.It is clear to everyone except  Rudy that he has no chance. He is small, poor and not overly bright. He  doesn't even show any brilliance playing high school football, although he  plays with unmatched enthusiasm. So the avenues open to him which would  allow entry into the Notre Dame football team seem non existent.I  particularly like the scene where Rudy's Dad, Danny, played by Ned Beatty,  tries to convince him to aim at a more modest target. He describes how his  own Father, an immigrant, gambled his whole life savings on a farm during  the depression. Naturally he lost everything. This taught Danny the value  of caution and the danger of dreams. But it is water off a ducks back to  Rudy.Never giving up, Rudy struggles to take any avenue which  would bring him closer to his goal. Whilst most people that he meets  actively discourage him, a few seem to see, with wonder, the strength of  his conviction. He is portrayed as a single minded man, yes. But he also  has a lot of compassion. What a great example he makes of how one can  assert the right to fight for a goal whilst still holding out a helping  hand to others along the way.In a word, this film is  inspirational. If you feel the world is getting to be too much to handle,  watch Rudy. I guarantee you will feel recharged.",4,"Nothing is impossible, if you never give up.",958003200,"05 11, 2000",2000,1921,"['Rudy', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'sense', 'struggle', 'break', 'one', 'class', 'prefer', 'think', 'vivid', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'achieved', 'pure', 'dedication', 'goal.Rudy', 'Ruettiger', 'played', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'one', 'many', 'children', 'born', 'lower', 'class', 'family', 'steel', 'mill', 'workers', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'family', 'devoted', 'football', 'specifically', 'team', 'local', 'university', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'Sprouting', 'base', 'economic', 'hardship', 'team', 'idolatry', 'dream', 'born', 'Rudy', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'up', 'mind', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'play', 'families', 'favourite', 'team.It', 'clear', 'everyone', 'Rudy', 'chance', 'small', 'poor', 'not', 'overly', 'bright', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'brilliance', 'playing', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'unmatched', 'enthusiasm', 'avenues', 'open', 'would', 'allow', 'entry', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'football', 'team', 'seem', 'non', 'existent.I', 'particularly', 'scene', 'where', 'Rudy', 'Dad', 'Danny', 'played', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'convince', 'aim', 'more', 'modest', 'target', 'how', 'own', 'Father', 'immigrant', 'gambled', 'whole', 'life', 'savings', 'farm', 'depression', 'Naturally', 'lost', 'everything', 'taught', 'Danny', 'value', 'caution', 'danger', 'dreams', 'water', 'ducks', 'back', 'Rudy.Never', 'giving', 'up', 'Rudy', 'take', 'avenue', 'would', 'bring', 'closer', 'goal', 'most', 'people', 'actively', 'discourage', 'few', 'seem', 'see', 'wonder', 'strength', 'conviction', 'portrayed', 'single', 'minded', 'man', 'yes', 'also', 'lot', 'compassion', 'What', 'great', 'example', 'how', 'one', 'can', 'assert', 'right', 'fight', 'goal', 'whilst', 'still', 'holding', 'out', 'helping', 'hand', 'others', 'way.In', 'word', 'film', 'inspirational', 'feel', 'world', 'getting', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'watch', 'Rudy', 'guarantee', 'will', 'feel', 'recharged']",N/A

It's emotional, it's touching, it's realistic and it has some great sports action (not a lot, but enough)...but what makes `Rudy' stand out above the rest is it's heart, and that heart is elevated through Sean Astin's wonderful performance.  As Rudy, Sean shows us a boy with so much determination amidst so much rejection and lack of support.  As a boy he always dreamed of playing for Notre Dame but when the time came his grades wouldn't allow it.  No one but his best friend even believed in him, but when his best friend suffers an untimely death Rudy starts to believe in himself.  He enrolls in a school close by in an attempt to raise his grades and get accepted into Notre Dame and when he eventually does so his family is pleased (for the most part) but they still knock him down when he proclaims his determination to make the football team.  It's not that Rudy doesn't have the knowledge of the game or even the skill to play, he's just way to small to make any difference on the field.  But with all his heart and soul on his sleeve he makes a difference, in the hearts of his teammates, his coach, his town and eventually his family.  It's a truly heartwarming and tender film with a knock out performance by Astin.  Great film for any sports buff, but for all you ladies out there wondering if this is just a guy flick, it's not.  It's a movie about believing in yourself...and you'll love it if not for the fact you'll see your man cry.",4,Root for Rudy,1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,1514,"['Rudy', 'things', 'good', 'sports', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'emotional', 'touching', 'realistic', 'great', 'sports', 'action', 'not', 'lot', 'enough', 'what', 'Rudy', 'stand', 'out', 'rest', 'heart', 'heart', 'elevated', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Rudy', 'Sean', 'boy', 'so', 'much', 'determination', 'so', 'much', 'rejection', 'lack', 'support', 'boy', 'always', 'dreamed', 'playing', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'when', 'time', 'came', 'grades', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'one', 'best', 'friend', 'even', 'believed', 'when', 'best', 'friend', 'untimely', 'death', 'Rudy', 'believe', 'school', 'close', 'attempt', 'raise', 'grades', 'get', 'accepted', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'when', 'eventually', 'so', 'family', 'pleased', 'most', 'part', 'still', 'knock', 'down', 'when', 'determination', 'make', 'football', 'team', 'not', 'Rudy', ""n't"", 'have', 'knowledge', 'game', 'even', 'skill', 'play', 'just', 'way', 'small', 'make', 'difference', 'field', 'heart', 'soul', 'sleeve', 'difference', 'hearts', 'teammates', 'coach', 'town', 'eventually', 'family', 'truly', 'heartwarming', 'tender', 'film', 'knock', 'out', 'performance', 'Astin', 'Great', 'film', 'sports', 'buff', 'there', 'wondering', 'just', 'guy', 'flick', 'not', 'movie', 'believing', ""'ll"", 'love', 'not', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'see', 'man', 'cry']",N/A
162575,A2GYX971VETQBV,0800128052,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[12, 13]","RUDY is the story of a boy chasing a dream, who in the process becomes a man.  It is a plot formula that we have seen before, time and time again.  So what makes RUDY stand out so much in my mind?  I think what makes this film so successful is the fact that it is true to life, unlike many sports films.  In your typical ""underdog"" film, the sports team faces another losing season, only to channel their hopes and dreams into winning the state championship, the World Cup, etc.  It is a concept that is generally played out exclusively ""on the field,"" presenting the audience with a myopic view of the world in which sports are the only thing that matters.  I often wonder to myself, after seeing such a film, ""What happened to them after that?""  And unless we're watching THE MIGHTY DUCKS, who decide to answer the question by putting out more movies, that question is left unanswered.RUDY is very different.  Here is a story about a dream.  It is not a dream to score the winning touchdown of a bowl game.  It is not a dream to play professional football.  It is not an unrealizable fantasy that is sloppily achieved through the magic of filmmaking.  Instead, it is a simple dream: to dress for one game on the Notre Dame football team.  That's it.  Moreover, RUDY is not the story of a man who accomplishes his goal in one season.  It takes him years of hard work and disappointment.  The effect of telling such a story is epic.  By the time our hero finally takes the field, the emotional intensity of that moment is much greater than in most other sports movies I've seen.  I am generally not really relieved or emotional when the underdog team finally wins the match-even if ""We Are the Champions"" is playing in the background, asking for our tears.  But I wanted to see Rudy (Sean Astin) take the field so bad, I was extremely involved in the film.Sean Astin does an incredible job in this role and I think it is by far one of the best performances of his career.  In short, if you like sports movies in which the underdog triumphs in the end, you will love RUDY.  It blows the genre out of the water.  Instead of focusing solely ""on the field,"" this film focuses more on the transformation of Rudy's character and the surrounding details and experiences of his life.

Determined to defy all those who doubt his dream of playing football at the University of Notre Dame, Daniel &quot;Rudy&quot; Ruettiger sets off for South Bend, Indiana with a duffle bag filled with hopes and a bus ticket. Once arriving at his intended destination, he is met by a caring Catholic priest (Robert Prosky), who sees Rudy's heart and desire, and is determined to help this young man accomplish his goal. A timeline is established, where Rudy must maintain a respectable grade point average at Holy Cross Junior College in a year's time. If grades are successfully met, he'll be one step closer to realizing his dream of both playing football for the Fighting Irish, thus gaining admission into Notre Dame. Adding a bit more meat and potatoes to &quot;Rudy&quot;'s storyline, are fine, upstanding, believable performances from Ned Beatty (as Rudy's father), Scott Benjaminson (as Rudy's doubting Thomas brother), Lili Taylor (as Rudy's girlfriend) and Jason Miller (as legendary ND coach Ara Parseghian). Charles S. Dutton's performance as the head stadium groundskeeper mustn't be overlooked, either. To sum everything up, &quot;Rudy&quot; is a film that's about more than just football. It's about conquering mountains, big and small, which isn't impossible, as long as one keeps their nose to the grindstone, or, in this case, to the gridiron. Having doubts about whether or not you can win life's battles? See this movie. Hearing nothing but negativity from those around you while en route to accomplishing your goal? See this movie. Do you dream of getting a college degree, and want to make it a reality? SEE THIS MOVIE!!! Oh, and see if you can spot the cameo appearance of Mr. Daniel Ruettiger himself (INTERESTING TIDBITS: The exterior shot of the Holy Cross College campus, is actually one of the colleges on the Notre Dame campus. The scene in the campus coffee shop where Rudy and D-Bob (Jon Favreau [another actor I (almost) overlooked!]) are talking/studying, is shot in ND's O'Shaughnessy Hall, and the interior Holy Cross classroom scenes were filmed at a nearby high school). With so much to offer, &quot;Rudy&quot; truly lives up to its moniker as the &quot;Rocky Of The '90s&quot;! See it, if you haven't already.

He has no money, lousy high school grades, and zero size and athletic ability, yet his dream is to play football for the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame.  Again, what to do?Never give up on your dream.Director David Anspaugh's wonderful RUDY is one of the most inspiring films I've ever seen.  Based on a true story, Rudy Ruettiger (played by Sean Astin, forever more known to me as Samwise Gamgee) is a blue collar kid with a stubborn streak as wide as the chip on his shoulder.  Rudy's family and high school teachers scoff at his dream of going to Notre Dame, yet the young man perseveres.  He enrolls at a junior college, applies again and again for admission to the university--applications that are subsequently denied--yet he perseveres.  With no place to live he befriends the head of the maintenance crew at the stadium (played wonderfully by Charles Dutton) and ultimately sleeps in the maintenance office, yet he perseveres.  And when he finally gets accepted to Notre Dame--when he walks on to the Fighting Irish's storied football program and gets the stuffing beat out him, day after day--he perseveres to the film's magical, magnificent ending, an ending that signifies his perseverance has paid off.This is a &quot;feel good&quot; movie that will make you stand up and cheer.  With unwavering respect and detail to Notre Dame tradition, RUDY delivers an inspirational story guaranteed to put a lump in your throat.  In fact, by the time the movie is over I'm crying more than the day I was born--and I'm looking for a pair of shoulder pads to put on and a tackling dummy to obliterate.

Rudy is such a powerful and memorable movie that it has made such an impact.  The term ""Rudy"" is now used in reference to the bench-warmers on high school and college sports teams.  For example, if a team is getting blown out or is blowing out another team, at the end of the game, the coach might put in the scrubs who rarely get to play.  Seeing this, someone in the stands might say ""Hey, look, the coach is putting in the Rudy,"" or ""The Rudys are coming into the game.""  There you have it.  A movie that has affected the way we speak and think about the players who spend most of the game on the sidelines.  Rudy (the movie) is entertaining, emotional, funny, and teaches a good lesson without being preachy.  The football scenes are great to watch too because they actually look real, unlike other sports movies.  And if you've ever warmed a bench (I have), you can take some solace in Rudy's plight.  I've never met a serious athlete who didn't love this movie.  A lot of people consider Rudy to be corny and cliched, but if you've been a Rudy, or if you've known one, then you'll see this movie for what it really is.  The casting is perfect, with Sean Astin giving what I consider to be the best performance of his career.  The music is also inspiring, and has been used in many other projects besides the movie.

162593,A2WJSVSBXEYEF,0800128052,Jefferson T. Packer,"[5, 6]","This film teaches the lesson that doors only open for you when you push, and it teaches that lesson more effectively than perhaps any motivational film ever made.Dan Ruettiger pushes through years of daunting physical, social and emotional obstacles to achieve two minutes of actual playing time for the University of Notre Dame.  Was it worth it?  Who are we to question another person's dream?  All that matters, is that it was worth it to him.Contrary to the opinion of another reviewer, I believe that that game time was bestowed not out of pity, but as a fitting tribute to the constantly inspiring dedication shown by a young man who, by all rights, had no business wearing that gold helmet.He gave HIMSELF the right to wear it by doing everything possible to put himself within touching distance of something that should have been impossible, and by doing so, he (through this film) creates a grand and powerful analogy of nothing less than the American Dream.How much of your life is up to you?  You won't know until you push up against what look like limits and obstacles, until you reach for what looks to be out of reach, and find out if your push is hard enough and your arm is long enough.  To do this, you will have to overcome your own fear, the doubt of your friends and family, and the reluctance of all the people who just want to shut their doors in your face; and even then you may fail.  But no one ever made anything of themselves by scoffing at dedication and heart.As Wayne Gretsky once said, ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.""  This wonderful film is about being willing to take the shots again and again and again, to risk everything for something you want more than anything else.

Rudy is persistent in his struggle, and Sean Astin masterfully plays him so he remains sympathetic without becoming annoying.  Look for appearances by former Notre Dame president Fr. Ted Hesburgh, a young Vince Vaughan and Lili Taylor and a great big Jon Favreau as Rudy's pal.

Years later, when faced with an otherwise dreary array of choices at the local video outlet, I focused on it in desperation, which simply demonstrates that the occasional diamond can be discovered among the dregs.RUDY is Daniel ""Rudy"" Ruettiger, the son of a blue-collar family in Joliet, whose dream is to play football for the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame. Unfortunately, Rudy is undersized, underskilled, and a virtual lump when it comes to the academic requirements needed for admission to that prestigious university. Graduating from high school, he seems destined, like the other male members of his family, to disappear into the grind of a union job at the local steel mill, never to resurface except in the fall with a brewski in front of the TV to view Saturday's Big Game. However, Rudy's dream verges on the obsessive, and he persists in his efforts against near impossible odds, much to the skepticism of his father and the ridicule of his brothers. Rudy has ... heart, with a capital H.This film is another of those underdog stories beloved by WASP American audiences. However, Sean Astin's performance as our young hero is so likable, so focused, so low key, and so uncomplicated by side plots, that the movie transcends the genre. It's one of those ultimate feel-good tales of the sort perhaps not achieved again until the 1999 release OCTOBER SKY.RUDY is a true story, which took place in the 70's (though presumably pumped up by the Hollywood screen writers). Indeed, if you're one to sit through the credits, you'll note that the real Daniel Ruettiger made a fleetingly brief cameo appearance among the Irish fans towards the end of the film.

The offense was still on the field and Joe Monatana hit Dwight Clark for a quit score to put Rudy on the field for the kickoff and a quick sack to save the game for the Fighting Irish. A heart warming story, misunderstood as teamwork by quack pros at businesses nationwide, the Irish at Notre Dame compete for the NCAA D1 National Championship every year.

Sean Astin was an inspired choice to play the title role; as he proved later in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, Astin is the kind of man who would be the kid brother or best friend to other men; or the shy, introverted boyfriend to a really nice girl.  Astin is also an actor who embellishes his roles with a rare intimacy and credibility that works especially well in a film like this.  He is ably supported by Jon Favreau as his rotund best friend; Charles S. Dutton who is marvelous as the maintenance man who serves as a surrogate coach/father to Rudy; and Lili Taylor as his girlfriend.

Discouraged, he shelves his dream and follows his father and brothers to work in a steel mill. Only one person, Rudy's best friend Pete, actually has faith in him. When Pete is killed in a freak accident four years later, something in Rudy is reawakened, and he realizes that if he's ever going to be happy in life, he needs to play football. He needs to go to Notre Dame. But he doesn't have the grades to get in. We see Rudy do everything in his power, for several long semesters, to gain admission to the prestigious school.But getting into Notre Dame isn't his only problem. Once in, he has to get on the team - no mean feat for someone who, in the words of the maintenance man Fortune (Charles S. Dutton), is &quot;five-foot nothin', a hundred and nothin',&quot; and has &quot;no speck of athletic ability.&quot; And even after he's on the team, there's no guarantee that he'll actually get to dress for a game. In the end, however, the results of Rudy's persistence and hard work are more than he could ever have imagined.&quot;Rudy&quot; is a touching true story of the power of hope and hard work. It is a football movie, but it is also so much more than that. Rudy's steadfastness is very moving to see, and Sean Astin captures the character beautifully. I think this is Astin's best performance, transcending even Samwise Gamgee in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (it's a close call though). The supporting cast members are just as perfectly fitted to their roles. Charles S. Dutton turns in a great performance as Fortune, ultimately Rudy's best mentor, and Robert Prosky plays Father Cavanaugh, the priest at Notre Dame who offers Rudy a chance to improve his grades at a nearby junior college, whereby he just might have a shot at admission.The soundtrack to the film is perfectly fitted. It puts the final cap on many an emotional scene. This Special Edition DVD offers an isolated music score, letting you listen to the music alone. The DVD has some other nice bonus features as well: &quot;Rudy: The Real Story&quot; is a short documentary on the real Rudy Ruettiger, with commentary from the man himself. It is touching to see Ruettiger talk about his experiences, and one can see that Sean Astin did a magnificent job conveying him to the screen. There is also a &quot;Production&quot; featurette, briefly outlining the making of the movie, and finally &quot;60 Seconds With Sean Astin&quot; features the actor giving us some quick commentary on the film. There are also Talent Files on the director and actors.&quot;Rudy&quot; is one of the most inspirational sports movies I've ever seen. The fact that it is a true story makes it all the more amazing. If you enjoy films like &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; (with Denzel Washington), you'll love &quot;Rudy&quot; (and if you like &quot;Rudy&quot; but haven't seen &quot;Remember the Titans,&quot; I recommend that one as well). This is a wonderful movie for anyone, whether you're a football fan or not (I'm not). It is emotional and moving, but never goes over the top.

It's the true story of Daniel &quot;Rudy&quot; Ruettiger, an unremarkable student and football player from 1970s working-class Chicago with the very remarkable dream of playing football for the University of Notre Dame. He overcomes everything you can think of--poverty, doubtful parents, bad grades, friend's death, height deficiency, girlfriends, learning disability--to accomplish his goal, and believe it or not, the movie is every bit as inspiring as it claims to be.The ending is predictable (with the truth being stretched by more than those few seconds) but doesn't detract from his struggle to land in the House that Rock built. Its charm comes from a great ensemble cast that delivers solid performances throughout. Sean Astin does well as the pint-size player, allowing his character to be more than the typical wholesome underdog. Rudy's frustrations with his family, school, and football all resonate clearly on screen, in effect making his triumph all the more powerful. Ned Beatty as the father powers the familial tensions that drive Rudy to succeed while Jon Favreau's D-Bob, Rudy's loyal bud, lends a gentle touch of humor. His two mentors, played by Charles Dutton and Robert Prosky, add strong doses of determination and prayer, respectively. Director David Anspaugh wisely capitalizes on Notre Dame's beautiful campus by using the scenery to frame the luckless student's persistence and desire. A moving score by Jerry Goldsmith coupled with Notre Dame chants and fight songs balance the emotional visuals.There are many elements that will appeal to an audience of any age including relationships within the family, overcoming obstacles, self-motivation, etc. As an ND student, I admit my bias, but in fairness to the movie, &quot;Rudy&quot; will capture your heart; be assured, this film survives multiple viewings.",5,The only football movie for your collection,965779200,"08 9, 2000",2000,1930,"['quot', 'Rudy', 'quot', 'uplifting', 'own', 'sappy', 'goofy', 'way', 'impossible', 'not', 'cheer', 'true', 'story', 'Daniel', 'quot', 'Rudy', 'quot', 'Ruettiger', 'unremarkable', 'student', 'football', 'player', '1970s', 'working-class', 'Chicago', 'very', 'remarkable', 'dream', 'playing', 'football', 'University', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'everything', 'can', 'think', 'poverty', 'doubtful', 'parents', 'bad', 'grades', 'friend', 'death', 'height', 'deficiency', 'girlfriends', 'learning', 'disability', 'accomplish', 'goal', 'believe', 'not', 'movie', 'bit', 'as', 'inspiring', 'be.The', 'ending', 'predictable', 'truth', 'being', 'stretched', 'more', 'few', 'seconds', ""n't"", 'detract', 'struggle', 'land', 'House', 'Rock', 'built', 'charm', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'delivers', 'solid', 'performances', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'well', 'pint-size', 'player', 'allowing', 'character', 'be', 'more', 'typical', 'wholesome', 'underdog', 'Rudy', 'frustrations', 'family', 'school', 'football', 'resonate', 'clearly', 'screen', 'effect', 'making', 'triumph', 'more', 'powerful', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'father', 'familial', 'tensions', 'drive', 'Rudy', 'succeed', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'D-Bob', 'Rudy', 'loyal', 'bud', 'gentle', 'touch', 'humor', 'two', 'mentors', 'played', 'Charles', 'Dutton', 'Robert', 'Prosky', 'add', 'strong', 'doses', 'determination', 'prayer', 'respectively', 'Director', 'David', 'Anspaugh', 'wisely', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'beautiful', 'campus', 'using', 'scenery', 'frame', 'luckless', 'student', 'persistence', 'desire', 'moving', 'score', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'coupled', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'chants', 'fight', 'songs', 'emotional', 'visuals.There', 'are', 'many', 'elements', 'will', 'appeal', 'audience', 'age', 'including', 'relationships', 'family', 'overcoming', 'obstacles', 'self-motivation', 'etc', 'ND', 'student', 'admit', 'bias', 'fairness', 'movie', 'quot', 'Rudy', 'quot', 'will', 'capture', 'heart', 'be', 'assured', 'film', 'multiple', 'viewings']",N/A

162641,A39WM5BQ54J8XY,0800128052,"Randy E. Aveille ""raveille""","[3, 4]","Never mind the part of this story that is about football, because the premise of this movie is much more significant and intriguing than just football. This is a story about the little guy; the average Joe who has no special attributes or talents. But what this average Joe does have is an undying dream, and eventually, he develops the courage to follow them-and does it with all his heart and soul.It's based on a true story about Daniel E. ""Rudy"" Ruettiger, the son of an oil refinery worker and third of fourteen children. An underdog with marginal talent and intellect, Rudy rose from valleys of discouragement and despair to the pinnacles of success.From the movie, it seems Rudy has little inspiration in his life as a boy, but the nostalgia, history, and tradition of Notre Dame Football seems to be a bright spot for him and his family; and he clings to that. Memorizing a famous speech by Knute Rockne (read it at: [...] Rudy recites it perfectly as if he were Knute himself, demonstrating his love for Irish football tradition.On one of his birthdays, Rudy's gets a vintage ""Fighting Irish"" letterman jacket from his best friend, and soon after, his best friend dies in an accident at the refinery. Already in his twenties, hitting rock-bottom, and feeling as though he has nothing to lose, Rudy decides to take a chance and pursue his life-long dream of playing football for The Irish. He pursues his dream not only for himself, but also for his best-friend, who knew how much Rudy loved the mystique of Notre Dame. He also wants his family, and especially his father, to be proud of him. He seems to want to vicariously fulfill what is really a dream that is shared by everyone he loves; but there's only one problem. Rudy does not have the grades to qualify for admission to Notre Dame.Thus, he begins his struggle at Holy Cross before gaining acceptance to Notre Dame. With the help of a socially inept new friend, Rudy manages to struggle through his courses at Holy Cross, gradually improving his grades. While at Holy Cross, Rudy applies for Notre Dame and is turned down several times. Feeling hopeless and doubtful, and just when all seems lost, he gets the latest reply from Notre Dame. He reluctantly opens it, fearing the worst, but Rudy is finally accepted. He applied to Notre Dame three times before he was accepted on his fourth attempt.After being admitted to Notre Dame, Rudy is out of money and relies on help from several people who are taken with his indomitable determination to never quit trying. When Rudy walks-on for tryouts, he is not given much of a chance by the coaches. Feeling thankful for the getting a chance, he promises football coach Ara Parseghian he'll make the team. After demonstrating a will and determination that is unmatched by anyone on the team, the coaches eventually give him a shot and he makes the team's scout squad. Rudy knows that if it weren't for his tenacity, he wouldn't have impressed the coaches enough to make the team. Along the way, Rudy earns the loyalty and respect of his teammates and coaches with his work ethic, and ends up raising the bar for the entire teams' level of play. There are many inspirational moments in this film and its climactic ending is no exception.He is the only player in the school's history to be carried off the field on his teammates' shoulders.There are so many amazing and inspiring moments in this film, but what has stayed with me the most is the lesson learned from watching the story. It's all about the triumph of the human spirit. It's a testament to never giving up on your dreams, giving it all that you have despite all the odds being stacked against you, and overcoming adversity in the pursuit of them. It reminds us about the importance of courage, faith, and perseverance and believing in yourself when no one else will.After Rudy Ruettiger accomplished his goal of playing for the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame, he realized a second goal: seeing his story on the big screen. For nine years Rudy's never-say-die philosophy was tested as he tackled Hollywood to make a movie about his life. At first it wasn't easy. &quot;Hollywood is one crazy damned place,&quot; Ruettiger told the Boston Globe's Michael Blowen. &quot;It was a mess... I just barged right into it, and trusted people in Hollywood. In 1993, his second impossible dream came true as Tri-Star Pictures released the blockbuster hit film, Rudy.This is one of the only movies that have ever made me weep every time I see it.

162648,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,0800128052,Robert Morris,"[76, 84]","My Four Star rating reflects both overall enjoyment while seeing the film (Five Stars) and occasional irritation with director Anspaugh's manipulative strategies insofar as emotions are concerned (Three Stars). The dramatic impact of Rudy Ruettiger's struggles to suit up for, if not play in a Notre Dame football game is diminished by such manipulation. That said, Sean Astin is wholly credible as Rudy. Other noteworthy performances are provided by Ned Beatty (Rudy's father, Daniel), Charles S. Dutton (Fortune), Robert Prosky (Father Cavenaugh), Jon Favreau (D-Bob), Lili Taylor (Sherry), and Scott Benjaminson (Frank). Both the &quot;Real Rudy&quot; and the &quot;Reel Rudy&quot; faced two significant barriers to being admitted to Notre Dame and then playing in a varsity football game: weak grades and diminutive size. Eventually, through tenacious study while enrolled at nearby Holy Cross College, both Rudys are finally admitted to Notre Dame; through rigorous training, both then became fit enough to be selected to play on the practice (i.e. fodder) squad.  And finally, both play (the &quot;Real Rudy&quot; for 27 seconds) in the last home game against Georgia Tech in 1975.Others have their own reasons for liking this film so much. Here are three of mine. First, the casting of Astin in the lead role. His performance is endearing, to be sure, but also convincing. Hence my discomfort with Anspaugh's use of gimmicks when none is necessary. Second, the exteriors shot on the Notre Dame campus which is especially lovely during each of the four seasons. I really did feel as if I were tagging along with Rudy as he attends classes, works for Fortune as a member of the stadium's groundskeeping crew, and then participates in especially brutal team practices. Third and finally, I enjoyed observing what seems to be a totally authentic respect for Rudy among the team's starters both on offense and defense. That respect was earned day in and day out, brutal practice after brutal practice, as Rudy and his battered companions helped to prepare the team for its next game. It is worth noting that Rudy Ruettiger was the only player ever to be carried off the field at Notre Dame stadium. The filmmakers recreated the scene with real fans during a break in the 1992 Boston College game. Some 60,000 fans stood and cheered as actor Sean Astin was carried off the field.Those who enjoyed this film should also check out The Natural (1984), Hoosiers (1986), Babe (1995), Remember the Titans (2000), and Miracle (2004).___________________________________________________________________________________Those who are curious about the &quot;real&quot; and &quot;reel&quot; Rudy Ruettiger are encouraged to visit [...] Here are brief excerpts:Q: Was the groundskeeper played by Charles S. Dutton a real character?A: Rudy answered no to this question himself during an interview with the Pigskin Post by saying the following, &quot;He was a composite, but that was reality. And that's what happened in my life...all through my life. I would encounter people like that and they would help me get through the tough times through their wisdom and their encouragement.&quot;Q: Was there actually a priest who helped Rudy get into Holy Cross Junior College?A: In the same Pigskin Post interview as above, Rudy replied to this question by saying, &quot;There were several who played important roles, but, again, you can't develop them all in one two-hour movie.&quot;Q: Did Rudy really sleep in the maintenance room of the football stadium?A: Rudy actually slept in a room in the basketball arena. The school had the room there for someone to stay during off-hours for insurance reasons.Q: Was coach Dan Devine really that cold-hearted against dressing Rudy for the last home game of Rudy's college career?A: In Devine's autobiography, Simply Devine, he writes that it was his idea to dress Rudy for the final game of his college career and also to play him. Devine says that the screenwriter, Angelo Pizzo, told him that the plot would only work if Devine became the heavy. He agreed in order to help out Rudy, someone whom he calls a friend. &quot;I didn't realize I would be such a heavy,&quot; he writes.",4,Generally Irresistible But Occasionally Manipulative,1087948800,"06 23, 2004",2004,4207,"['Four', 'Star', 'rating', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'seeing', 'film', 'Five', 'Stars', 'occasional', 'irritation', 'director', 'Anspaugh', 'manipulative', 'strategies', 'insofar', 'emotions', 'are', 'concerned', 'Three', 'Stars', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'Rudy', 'Ruettiger', 'struggles', 'suit', 'up', 'not', 'play', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'football', 'game', 'diminished', 'such', 'manipulation', 'said', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'wholly', 'credible', 'Rudy', 'Other', 'noteworthy', 'performances', 'are', 'provided', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'Rudy', 'father', 'Daniel', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'Fortune', 'Robert', 'Prosky', 'Father', 'Cavenaugh', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'D-Bob', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Sherry', 'Scott', 'Benjaminson', 'Frank', 'quot', 'Real', 'Rudy', 'quot', 'quot', 'Reel', 'Rudy', 'quot', 'faced', 'two', 'significant', 'barriers', 'being', 'admitted', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'then', 'playing', 'varsity', 'football', 'game', 'weak', 'grades', 'diminutive', 'size', 'Eventually', 'tenacious', 'study', 'enrolled', 'nearby', 'Holy', 'Cross', 'College', 'Rudys', 'are', 'finally', 'admitted', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'rigorous', 'training', 'then', 'became', 'fit', 'enough', 'be', 'selected', 'play', 'practice', 'i.e', 'fodder', 'squad', 'finally', 'play', 'quot', 'Real', 'Rudy', 'quot', '27', 'seconds', 'last', 'home', 'game', 'Georgia', 'Tech', '1975.Others', 'have', 'own', 'reasons', 'liking', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'Here', 'are', 'three', 'mine', 'First', 'casting', 'Astin', 'lead', 'role', 'performance', 'endearing', 'be', 'sure', 'also', 'convincing', 'Hence', 'discomfort', 'Anspaugh', 'use', 'gimmicks', 'when', 'none', 'necessary', 'Second', 'exteriors', 'shot', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'campus', 'especially', 'lovely', 'four', 'seasons', 'really', 'did', 'feel', 'were', 'tagging', 'along', 'Rudy', 'classes', 'Fortune', 'member', 'stadium', 'groundskeeping', 'crew', 'then', 'especially', 'brutal', 'team', 'practices', 'Third', 'finally', 'enjoyed', 'observing', 'what', 'be', 'totally', 'authentic', 'respect', 'Rudy', 'team', 'starters', 'offense', 'defense', 'respect', 'was', 'earned', 'day', 'day', 'out', 'brutal', 'practice', 'brutal', 'practice', 'Rudy', 'battered', 'companions', 'helped', 'prepare', 'team', 'next', 'game', 'worth', 'noting', 'Rudy', 'Ruettiger', 'was', 'only', 'player', 'ever', 'be', 'carried', 'field', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'stadium', 'filmmakers', 'recreated', 'scene', 'real', 'fans', 'break', '1992', 'Boston', 'College', 'game', '60,000', 'fans', 'stood', 'cheered', 'actor', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'was', 'carried', 'field.Those', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'should', 'also', 'check', 'out', 'Natural', '1984', 'Hoosiers', '1986', 'Babe', '1995', 'Remember', 'Titans', '2000', 'Miracle', '2004', '.___________________________________________________________________________________Those', 'who', 'are', 'curious', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'quot', 'reel', 'quot', 'Rudy', 'Ruettiger', 'are', 'encouraged', 'visit', '[', ']', 'Here', 'are', 'brief', 'excerpts', 'Q', 'Was', 'groundskeeper', 'played', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'real', 'character', 'Rudy', 'answered', 'question', 'interview', 'Pigskin', 'Post', 'saying', 'following', 'quot', 'was', 'composite', 'was', 'reality', 'what', 'happened', 'life', 'life', 'would', 'encounter', 'people', 'would', 'help', 'get', 'tough', 'times', 'wisdom', 'encouragement.', 'quot', 'Q', 'Was', 'actually', 'priest', 'who', 'helped', 'Rudy', 'get', 'Holy', 'Cross', 'Junior', 'College', 'same', 'Pigskin', 'Post', 'interview', 'Rudy', 'replied', 'question', 'saying', 'quot', 'were', 'several', 'who', 'played', 'important', 'roles', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'develop', 'one', 'two-hour', 'movie.', 'quot', 'Did', 'Rudy', 'really', 'maintenance', 'room', 'football', 'stadium', 'Rudy', 'actually', 'slept', 'room', 'basketball', 'arena', 'school', 'had', 'room', 'there', 'someone', 'stay', 'off-hours', 'insurance', 'reasons.Q', 'Was', 'coach', 'Dan', 'Devine', 'really', 'cold-hearted', 'dressing', 'Rudy', 'last', 'home', 'game', 'Rudy', 'college', 'career', 'Devine', 'autobiography', 'Simply', 'Devine', 'was', 'idea', 'dress', 'Rudy', 'final', 'game', 'college', 'career', 'also', 'play', 'Devine', 'screenwriter', 'Angelo', 'Pizzo', 'told', 'plot', 'would', 'only', 'work', 'Devine', 'became', 'heavy', 'agreed', 'order', 'help', 'out', 'Rudy', 'someone', 'whom', 'friend', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'would', 'be', 'such', 'heavy', 'quot']",N/A

In a great sense, it is a power of the American dream, that anyone, when given the opportunity, can fulfill their dreams and ambitions.  Everyone who lives in this country, and everyone who has ideas and notions of the United States, understands that the American dream is about being given the opportunity.""Rudy"" is one of the greatest sports films ever made.  The film was put together by the same team that gave us ""Hoosiers"" several years earlier.  It's obvious that they love stories about the underdog, and Rudy Ruettiger certainly falls into that category.  Some of the best films made are underdog stories.  ""Rocky"" is one of the best.  However, what makes ""Rudy"" and ""Hoosiers"" special is that they are based on real people and events.Rudy Ruettiger is a young man who has but one dream that he has had since he was a small boy: to be a Notre Dame football player.  No one thinks he can do it.  Not even his own family believes that he is capable of fulfilling this larger than life ambition.  ""Notre Dame is for rich kids.  It's not for us,"" says his father.  ""Don't waste your life chasing a stupid dream.""  This is the attitude of virtually everyone around Rudy.  He's not especially big or even athletic, but he's got what most other players lack: heart.  He is able to win over the coaches and teammates with his grit, determination, and unyielding desire to do everything it takes to make the Notre Dame team the best in the country, even if it means taking a beating every day during practice.Fulfilling dreams is often a difficult and even daunting task.  First, Rudy must get accepted into the university of Notre Dame.  He's over at Holy Cross eagerly picking up his mail to see if he has been accepted.  This isn't as easy as it seems as he is rejected one semester after another.  Sean Astin gives the performance of his life in this film.  He's able to make the audience share in his frustrations and doubts, while picking us up with his enthusiasm and over-zealous behavior regarding the football team.Rudy's next hurtle is to make the football team.  This is no easy task either as he has to make sure to give 110% just to make sure that the coaches see that he won't give up.Finally, Rudy's next obstacle, and perhaps his biggest, is to find a way to dress for one game so that he can officially be recognized as a member of the Notre Dame football team.  After all, this is his truest desire; to play in a game.  The other accomplishments are merely steps toward this ultimate goal.Anyone with a beating heart can't help but feel moved and inspired during the last few minutes of the film when Rudy is finally able to take the field.  The dreams of nearly twenty-four years are felt in that final moment as they are finally fulfilled, and the story and events leading us to this point make it all the more powerful.  But, you cannot appreciate the destination without appreciating the journey.  Rudy's story would not be half as inspired if we weren't given access to the obstacles that he had to face and overcome.  As many have said, it is in the journey.I must mention the wonderful music of Jerry Goldsmith.  It adds such a dimension to this film, that I'm sure you'll hear it playing over and over in your head long after the movie is over.  The drums that he has beating throughout the soundtrack seem to beat with the same determination that Rudy has; as if he is grinding out each and every day, struggling to overcome each and every obstacle.it is simply fantastic that stories like these are brought to light, whether it be through television, books, or movies.  This is a film for the entire family to enjoy.  All of us, at some time or another, need to be reminded that if we have a dream, we should never, ever give up until we fulfill it.  This movie is a powerful testament to all who dream, and to all who wish to accomplish their dream.",5,A Testament To the Power of Determination and Fulfilling Your Dreams,1188950400,"09 5, 2007",2007,4087,"['Rudy', 'one', 'special', 'films', 'can', 'truly', 'change', 'people', 'lives', 'inspiration', 'power', 'live', 'dreams', 'matter', 'obstacles', 'are', 'placed', 'great', 'sense', 'power', 'American', 'dream', 'anyone', 'when', 'given', 'opportunity', 'can', 'fulfill', 'dreams', 'ambitions', 'Everyone', 'who', 'country', 'everyone', 'who', 'ideas', 'notions', 'United', 'States', 'American', 'dream', 'being', 'given', 'opportunity', 'Rudy', 'one', 'greatest', 'sports', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'same', 'team', 'gave', 'Hoosiers', 'several', 'years', 'earlier', 'obvious', 'love', 'stories', 'underdog', 'Rudy', 'Ruettiger', 'certainly', 'category', 'best', 'films', 'made', 'are', 'underdog', 'stories', 'Rocky', 'one', 'best', 'However', 'what', 'Rudy', 'Hoosiers', 'special', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'people', 'events.Rudy', 'Ruettiger', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'one', 'dream', 'had', 'was', 'small', 'boy', 'be', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'football', 'player', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'Not', 'even', 'own', 'family', 'capable', 'fulfilling', 'larger', 'life', 'ambition', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'rich', 'kids', 'not', 'father', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'life', 'chasing', 'stupid', 'dream', 'attitude', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'Rudy', 'not', 'especially', 'big', 'even', 'athletic', 'got', 'what', 'most', 'other', 'players', 'lack', 'heart', 'able', 'win', 'coaches', 'teammates', 'grit', 'determination', 'unyielding', 'desire', 'do', 'everything', 'make', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'best', 'country', 'even', 'taking', 'beating', 'day', 'practice.Fulfilling', 'dreams', 'often', 'difficult', 'even', 'daunting', 'task', 'First', 'Rudy', 'must', 'get', 'accepted', 'university', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'over', 'Holy', 'Cross', 'eagerly', 'picking', 'up', 'mail', 'see', 'been', 'accepted', ""n't"", 'as', 'easy', 'rejected', 'one', 'semester', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'performance', 'life', 'film', 'able', 'make', 'audience', 'share', 'frustrations', 'doubts', 'picking', 'up', 'enthusiasm', 'over-zealous', 'behavior', 'regarding', 'football', 'team.Rudy', 'next', 'hurtle', 'make', 'football', 'team', 'easy', 'task', 'make', 'sure', 'give', '110', '%', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'coaches', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up.Finally', 'Rudy', 'next', 'obstacle', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'find', 'way', 'dress', 'one', 'game', 'so', 'can', 'officially', 'be', 'recognized', 'member', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'football', 'team', 'truest', 'desire', 'play', 'game', 'other', 'accomplishments', 'are', 'merely', 'steps', 'ultimate', 'goal.Anyone', 'beating', 'heart', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'moved', 'inspired', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'when', 'Rudy', 'finally', 'able', 'take', 'field', 'dreams', 'nearly', 'twenty-four', 'years', 'are', 'felt', 'final', 'moment', 'are', 'finally', 'fulfilled', 'story', 'events', 'leading', 'point', 'make', 'more', 'powerful', 'can', 'not', 'appreciate', 'destination', 'appreciating', 'journey', 'Rudy', 'story', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'half', 'inspired', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'access', 'obstacles', 'had', 'face', 'overcome', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'journey.I', 'must', 'mention', 'wonderful', 'music', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'dimension', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'playing', 'head', 'long', 'movie', 'drums', 'beating', 'soundtrack', 'seem', 'beat', 'same', 'determination', 'Rudy', 'grinding', 'out', 'day', 'struggling', 'overcome', 'obstacle.it', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'stories', 'are', 'brought', 'light', 'be', 'television', 'books', 'movies', 'film', 'entire', 'family', 'enjoy', 'time', 'need', 'be', 'reminded', 'have', 'dream', 'should', 'never', 'ever', 'give', 'up', 'fulfill', 'movie', 'powerful', 'testament', 'who', 'dream', 'who', 'wish', 'accomplish', 'dream']",N/A

Travers,"[5, 5]","'RUDY&quot; IS IRISH SENTIMENTALITY, BUT ENTERTAINING&quot;Rudy&quot; (1993) is one of those stories that could only be told about an institution like Notre Dame University. If anybody tried to make a film about a scrub trying to make the varsity at UCLA or Nebraska, they would never get it off the ground. As it is, Rudy Ruettiger had his share of troubles pitching the true tale of his appearance in Notre Dame's final 1975 game to Hollywood.&quot;I had an appointment with a producer,&quot; Ruettiger recalls, &quot;but he didn't show up at the appointed time and place. I was in Santa Monica, and I knew he lived nearby, so I asked the postman if he knew this guy.&quot;Ruettiger looks enough like the Midwestern rube he has been portrayed as than the sort of city psychopath the mailman might have suspected him to be, because he sent him right to the guy's house. The producer tried to fend Rudy off by telling him he was not a Notre Dame fan, but it ended up at Orion Pictures anyway, and was released just as the 1993 college football season was getting underway. Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz actually was threatened with N.C.A.A. penalties because he showed a bootleg copy to his players prior to the opener, trying to inspire the boys a la Knute Rockne. The infraction was providing entertainment to his team not available to the rest of the student body (somebody ought to go on a secret mission to Shawnnee Mission, Kansas and do a demolition of this near-useless organization). Anyway, it worked that day and most days in '93, as the Irish came within one loss to Boston College of the National Championship, but that is a different Irish tale. Despite a pretty good reception, the movie did not save Orion from folding up its operation about a year later.Patty Duke's son, Sean Astin (remember him in &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot; with Dudley Moore and Kirk Cameron?) stars as a blue-collar kid from a blue-collar family. He is a poor student, and a below-average high school football player despite his very best efforts. Upon graduation he goes to work in the steel mill just like everybody who ever lived in his home town, yet still clings to the fantasy of going to play ball in South Bend. Everybody scoffs at his craziness except his best buddy, who considers Rudy's goal quite within reach.When that buddy is killed in a mill accident, Rudy realizes it is now or never. Despite being closer to graduation than freshman age, he journeys to South Bend, is met by many obstacles and a kindly priest, enrolls in a junior college and makes good enough grades to get into N.D.Once there, he tries out for the football team, is kept around for four years as a &quot;tackling dummy,&quot; but due to his popularity on the team and among the student body, new coach Dan Devine fulfills old coach Ara Parseghian's promise to let him play a few minutes. Rudy even makes a tackle during garbage time of a game against Michigan State.Director David Anspaugh (&quot;Hoosiers&quot;) focuses on the character development of Angelo Pizzo's screenplay. The story is predictable (being true it was not easy to hide), but that matters less than Astin's inspired gullibility. Charles Dutton is terrific as the stadium groundskeeper, and Ned Beatty is great as his dad.Look, if you hate Notre Dame, this film will probably make you sick, but if you can at least tolerate the mythology for a couple hours, &quot;Rudy&quot; is one of the better sports movies of recent years.",4,"'RUDY&quot; IS IRISH SENTIMENTALITY, BUT ENTERTAINING",1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,3475,"['quot', 'IS', 'IRISH', 'SENTIMENTALITY', 'BUT', 'ENTERTAINING', 'quot', 'Rudy', 'quot', '1993', 'one', 'stories', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'told', 'institution', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'University', 'anybody', 'tried', 'make', 'film', 'scrub', 'trying', 'make', 'varsity', 'UCLA', 'Nebraska', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'off', 'ground', 'Rudy', 'Ruettiger', 'had', 'share', 'troubles', 'pitching', 'true', 'tale', 'appearance', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'final', '1975', 'game', 'Hollywood.', 'quot', 'had', 'appointment', 'producer', 'quot', 'Ruettiger', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'appointed', 'time', 'place', 'was', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'knew', 'lived', 'nearby', 'asked', 'postman', 'knew', 'guy.', 'quot', 'Ruettiger', 'enough', 'Midwestern', 'rube', 'been', 'portrayed', 'sort', 'city', 'psychopath', 'mailman', 'might', 'have', 'suspected', 'be', 'sent', 'right', 'guy', 'house', 'producer', 'tried', 'fend', 'Rudy', 'off', 'telling', 'was', 'not', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'fan', 'ended', 'up', 'Orion', 'Pictures', 'anyway', 'was', 'released', 'just', '1993', 'college', 'football', 'season', 'was', 'getting', 'underway', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'coach', 'Lou', 'Holtz', 'actually', 'was', 'threatened', 'N.C.A.A', 'penalties', 'showed', 'bootleg', 'copy', 'players', 'prior', 'opener', 'trying', 'inspire', 'boys', 'la', 'Knute', 'Rockne', 'infraction', 'was', 'providing', 'entertainment', 'team', 'not', 'available', 'rest', 'student', 'body', 'somebody', 'ought', 'go', 'secret', 'mission', 'Shawnnee', 'Mission', 'Kansas', 'do', 'demolition', 'near-useless', 'organization', 'Anyway', 'worked', 'day', 'most', 'days', ""'93"", 'Irish', 'came', 'one', 'loss', 'Boston', 'College', 'National', 'Championship', 'different', 'Irish', 'tale', 'pretty', 'good', 'reception', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'save', 'Orion', 'folding', 'up', 'operation', 'year', 'later.Patty', 'Duke', 'son', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'remember', 'quot', 'Father', 'Son', 'quot', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'blue-collar', 'kid', 'blue-collar', 'family', 'poor', 'student', 'below-average', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'player', 'very', 'best', 'efforts', 'graduation', 'work', 'steel', 'mill', 'just', 'everybody', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'home', 'town', 'yet', 'still', 'fantasy', 'going', 'play', 'ball', 'South', 'Bend', 'Everybody', 'craziness', 'best', 'buddy', 'who', 'Rudy', 'goal', 'quite', 'reach.When', 'buddy', 'killed', 'mill', 'accident', 'Rudy', 'now', 'never', 'being', 'closer', 'graduation', 'freshman', 'age', 'South', 'Bend', 'met', 'many', 'obstacles', 'kindly', 'priest', 'junior', 'college', 'good', 'enough', 'grades', 'get', 'N.D.Once', 'there', 'out', 'football', 'team', 'kept', 'four', 'years', 'quot', 'tackling', 'dummy', 'quot', 'due', 'popularity', 'team', 'student', 'body', 'new', 'coach', 'Dan', 'Devine', 'old', 'coach', 'Ara', 'Parseghian', 'promise', 'let', 'play', 'few', 'minutes', 'Rudy', 'even', 'tackle', 'garbage', 'time', 'game', 'Michigan', 'State.Director', 'David', 'Anspaugh', 'quot', 'Hoosiers', 'quot', 'character', 'development', 'Angelo', 'Pizzo', 'screenplay', 'story', 'predictable', 'being', 'true', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'hide', 'matters', 'less', 'Astin', 'inspired', 'gullibility', 'Charles', 'Dutton', 'terrific', 'stadium', 'groundskeeper', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'great', 'dad.Look', 'hate', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'make', 'sick', 'can', 'least', 'tolerate', 'mythology', 'couple', 'hours', 'quot', 'Rudy', 'quot', 'one', 'better', 'sports', 'movies', 'recent', 'years']",N/A

I CAN be inspired by someone who got this terrific opportunity and did something with it.Looking up more information about him, really doesn't say what he did with his life, other than wandering around getting keys to city kind of things, a hefty payout for some financial swindle he participated in, and getting paid to be on the speaker circuit.No doubt, he's a better man than that.

It is about a little boy who dreamed of becoming a football player for Notre-Dame. The little boy(Rudy) grew up to be a young man, with the same driven desire to be a football player for Notre-Dame.His father, and brothers all worked for the steel mill, and after high school graduation, Rudy (Sean Astin), and his best friend, ended up working at the steel mill too. After a fatal accident at the steel mill, Rudy changed forever, and with all the odds against him, and with everyone constantly telling him that he had no chance of ever playing football for Notre-Dame. Rudy left home to chase after his life long dream.My favorite scene in the movie is where the football players of Notre-Dame honored Rudy, by carrying him off the field on their shoulders after a game, as I watched this, tears of joy rolled down my face! Awesome! I highly recommend this movie! But movie people, next time, please, please, no ""GD"" cuss words!

This film (released in 1993) was one that i missed when first released. It is now 2003, and i finally had the privilege to view it. It's a true story of hardship, determination, luck, and hard work. I do not understand why the critics did not like the film. If critics did not spend so much time comparing it to other films and not by it's own merit, it would have received better reviews. Also, critics pounced on Goldsmith's score of the film. That was amusing, since it's only a film score, not intended to be a work of absolute brilliance. The score indeed enhanced the emotional aspect of the story. The film is a must-see, even if you do not care for football (myself included). The acting was what was needed for the film, nothing more. The film was not made to win all of the Academy Awards available, but proved that a true story could be told without getting too sentimental. I praise the film for being focused, and not having any sub-plots that would have marred the intent. It's a story for all ages.

Because Rudy had to do just that, and while in the film it wasn't said quite in that manner, that was the point. And in the end, the man with the dream, the one who listened to all the taunts, teases, and endured the agony of defeat, came out swinging. All adversaries whether friends or just plain creeps, they all ate crow in the end. The ones who encouraged Rudy shared in the joy of his victory!Hey, you watch this and you just think to yourself about how easy it is to throw in the towel. To get so disgusted with everything life throws at you, and just quit. I've done it, even seen some people do it with life. Life was just too tough, therefore suicide was the easiest way out. But it seemed to me that sometimes Rudy had that tough love when he wanted to give up. When he tried to say that a whole year at Holy Cross was a waste, his boss, the maintenance man told him this, ""You got your head so far up your ass about that damn football team, you missed the fact. You just got a year of top quality education. Waste? Don't be wastin' my time!"" If that doesn't wake you up, then keep dreaming! Listen to the ones who mentor you. You might not always like what they say, but they're usually always right!If you get just 1 thing out of this film, just remember to get up when you get knocked down. Don't let jerks get the best of you. John Hagee said, ""When God sends you out in the ocean to catch Moby Dick, TAKE THE TARTER SAUCE WITH YOU!!!"" The final lesson in this is simple. Don't apologize for your efforts. You will always have the kind of people who tell you, ""Look at who you might be hurting, you only think of yourself."" I've had to learn that sometimes, a simple SCREW YOU works just fine with that crowd, and I just kept my eyes open. Is this a tough lesson to learn? Oh yes is is! Is it worth it? Even more so.
