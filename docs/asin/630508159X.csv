447754,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,630508159X,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","You ever watch a movie that just sends chills up and down your body from beginning to end?  You ever watch a movie that cements itself in your subconscious and pulverizes you with its magnetism over and over, until you just cannot take it any more?  You ever watch a movie that is so rich and so disturbingly authentic that you feel compelled to laud it above all others?This is that movie.From the opening credits until the closing ones, `Marat/Sade' is one of the most engaging and utterly phenomenal pieces of art I have ever witnessed.  It is mind shattering in its delivery, coupling some of the most intriguing and utterly brilliant performances with one of the most compelling concepts ever put to film.  This is a masterclass film, one that gets everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) right.The film tells of the Marquis de Sade, a man imprisoned at Charenton Asylum in 1808.  He writes and directs a play starring his fellow inmates, a play that tells of the French Revolution, and he puts it on for the asylum director Coulmier and his family.  The film, taking place within the small confines of a prison cell and never leaving that one particular room, is so visually expansive that it is beyond me how director Peter Brook was able to accomplish this.  The film feels so much bigger than it is.  It's hard to really explain well how this movie works, but just know that despite the fact that it never leaves the one room it takes you to places much further than the confines of a cell would suggest.The film is based on the stage play by Peter Weiss and is shot much like a theatrical production, but it never feels stiff as some `stage to screen' films can feel.  This film moves with such fluidity, it's insanely impressive.Brook's decision to focus quite frequently on facial expressions of the cast was a brilliant way of making the film feel much more intimate than a mere stage production.  What is so important about this decision was that it allows the audience to see the insanity that lurks behind the inmates eyes, because the real story being told is not that of the play being put on but that of the character development of these lost souls, each of them playing their part in this intense and very controversial production.  These inmates become these characters and they absorb their weaknesses and their strengths and they embellish them with reckless abandon.  Watching their own humanity fester behind their sockets is chilling to say the least.There are two performers here that are beyond mesmerizing and that truly deserve all our recognition; and they are Glenda Jackson and Patrick Magee.  Patrick Magee delivers such a powerful and moving performance as the Marquis de Sade, his control so consistent and absorbing.  He takes a much different approach to the character than the one presented by Geoffrey Rush in `Quills', both spectacular but Magee is leagues better.  There are scenes where the camera is focused on his face and he is delivering a lengthy monologue that just sinks right into our flesh and becomes a part of us.  He is matched every step of the way by Glenda Jackson, who embodies Charlotte Corday from head to toe.  Just watch the way she connects to the dagger as if it were her long lost friend.  The scene is so symbolic of the actual revolt that is dominating the minds of the inmates as the carry on this play.And then there is that hair-whipping scene between Sade and Corday that just blew my mind.This is not a film for everyone, for the concept and delivery is far from commercial, and so if you are not a fan of the `arthouse' type films then this is one you may not want to entertain yourself with; but if you do enjoy a film rich with substance, some of which you may have to really uncover personally, then this is a film for you and one I urge you to find and watch.  The performances, the direction, the script and lighting; the editing and costumes and makeup and just everything are utter perfection.  There is not one sour note here, honestly.",5,Brilliant/Perfect,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,4014,"['ever', 'watch', 'movie', 'just', 'chills', 'up', 'down', 'body', 'beginning', 'end', 'ever', 'watch', 'movie', 'subconscious', 'magnetism', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'more', 'ever', 'watch', 'movie', 'so', 'rich', 'so', 'disturbingly', 'authentic', 'feel', 'compelled', 'laud', 'others', 'opening', 'credits', 'closing', 'ones', 'Marat/Sade', 'one', 'most', 'engaging', 'utterly', 'phenomenal', 'pieces', 'art', 'have', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'mind', 'shattering', 'delivery', 'coupling', 'most', 'intriguing', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'concepts', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'masterclass', 'film', 'one', 'everything', 'mean', 'EVERYTHING', 'right.The', 'film', 'tells', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Sade', 'man', 'imprisoned', 'Charenton', 'Asylum', '1808', 'play', 'starring', 'fellow', 'inmates', 'play', 'French', 'Revolution', 'asylum', 'director', 'Coulmier', 'family', 'film', 'taking', 'place', 'small', 'confines', 'prison', 'cell', 'never', 'leaving', 'one', 'particular', 'room', 'so', 'visually', 'expansive', 'how', 'director', 'Peter', 'Brook', 'was', 'able', 'accomplish', 'film', 'feels', 'so', 'much', 'bigger', 'hard', 'really', 'explain', 'well', 'how', 'movie', 'just', 'know', 'fact', 'never', 'one', 'room', 'places', 'much', 'further', 'confines', 'cell', 'would', 'suggest.The', 'film', 'based', 'stage', 'play', 'Peter', 'Weiss', 'shot', 'much', 'theatrical', 'production', 'never', 'stiff', 'stage', 'screen', 'films', 'can', 'feel', 'film', 'such', 'fluidity', 'insanely', 'impressive.Brook', 'decision', 'focus', 'quite', 'frequently', 'facial', 'expressions', 'cast', 'was', 'brilliant', 'way', 'making', 'film', 'feel', 'much', 'more', 'intimate', 'mere', 'stage', 'production', 'What', 'so', 'important', 'decision', 'was', 'audience', 'see', 'insanity', 'inmates', 'eyes', 'real', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'not', 'play', 'being', 'put', 'character', 'development', 'lost', 'souls', 'playing', 'part', 'intense', 'very', 'controversial', 'production', 'become', 'characters', 'absorb', 'weaknesses', 'strengths', 'embellish', 'reckless', 'abandon', 'Watching', 'own', 'humanity', 'fester', 'sockets', 'chilling', 'say', 'least.There', 'are', 'two', 'performers', 'here', 'are', 'mesmerizing', 'truly', 'deserve', 'recognition', 'are', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'Patrick', 'Magee', 'Patrick', 'Magee', 'delivers', 'such', 'powerful', 'moving', 'performance', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Sade', 'control', 'so', 'consistent', 'absorbing', 'much', 'different', 'approach', 'character', 'one', 'presented', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Quills', 'spectacular', 'Magee', 'leagues', 'better', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'camera', 'focused', 'face', 'delivering', 'lengthy', 'monologue', 'just', 'sinks', 'right', 'flesh', 'part', 'matched', 'step', 'way', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'who', 'Charlotte', 'Corday', 'head', 'toe', 'Just', 'watch', 'way', 'dagger', 'were', 'long', 'lost', 'friend', 'scene', 'so', 'symbolic', 'actual', 'revolt', 'dominating', 'minds', 'inmates', 'carry', 'play.And', 'then', 'hair-whipping', 'scene', 'Sade', 'Corday', 'just', 'blew', 'mind.This', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'concept', 'delivery', 'far', 'commercial', 'so', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'arthouse', 'type', 'films', 'then', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'entertain', 'do', 'enjoy', 'film', 'rich', 'substance', 'may', 'have', 'really', 'uncover', 'personally', 'then', 'film', 'one', 'urge', 'find', 'watch', 'performances', 'direction', 'script', 'lighting', 'editing', 'costumes', 'makeup', 'just', 'everything', 'are', 'utter', 'perfection', 'not', 'one', 'sour', 'note', 'here', 'honestly']",Marat Sade

447758,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,630508159X,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[18, 22]","MARAT/SADE is the film version of a play that arose from an actor's workshop exploring various theatrical theories expressed by French actor-director-writer Antoine Artard, who extolled a style of performance he described as &quot;theatre of cruelty&quot;--which, broadly speaking, consists of an assault upon the audience's senses by every means possible.  Ultimately, and although it makes effective use of its setting and the cinematography mirrors the chaos expected of such a situation, the film version of MARAT/SADE is less a motion picture than a record of a justly famous stage play that offers a complex statement re man's savagery.The story of MARAT/SADE concerns the performance of a play by inmates of an early 1800s insane asylum, with script and direction by the infamous Marquis de Sade.  (While this may sound a bit farfetched, it is based on fact: de Sade was known to have written plays for performance by inmates during his own incarceration in an asylum.)  The story of the play concerns the assasination of the revolutionary Marat by Charotte Corday, but the play itself becomes a debate between various characters, all of which may be read as in someway intrinsically destructive and evil.  Since all the characters are played by mentally-ill inmates of the asylum (the actor playing Marat, for example, is described as a paranoid, and the actress playing Corday suffers from sleeping sickness and meloncholia), the debate is further fueled by their insanity, unpredictability as performers, and the staff's reactions to both their behavior and the often subversive nature of the script they play out.Patrick Magee as de Sade, Glenda Jackson as the inmate playing Corday (it was her breakout performance), and Ian Richardson as the inmate playing Marat offering impressive performances; indeed, the ensemble cast as a whole is incredibly impressive, and they keep the extremely wordy script moving along with considerable interest.  Even so, it will be obvious that the material works better as a live performance than as a film, and I do not recommend it to a casual viewer; its appeal will be largely limited to the literary and theatrical intelligentsia.

Peter Brook, who is one of the world's most renowned theater directors, has made an excellent adaptation of The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade (the gloriously long official title).  I saw this film in college, and love the intensity of the whole thing.  Now that I am older and have read de Sade and a touch of Marat (which I didn't read in college, imagine that), things actually make more sense now, and the film/play resonates more deeply.  Patrick Magee and Ian Richardson are phenomenal in this film, and Brook's direction manages somehow to incorporate the best of the film aesthetic and theater aesthetic.  It is an amazingly intense experience, one that will sear itself in your memory.A note on the transfer.  The current edition is by MGM/UA, and while it isn't great (the film elements are a little worn out), it is letterboxed and the audio is decent.

Complaints that has been made  about the sound quality of the DVD though is well founded but unfortunately this was a problem with the movie when it first appeared in theatres.The movie takes place on a stage behind bars in asylum of Charenton. Behind the bars as well sit confident arrogant and ignorant  asylum's director and his family. Performed is a play written and directed by the Marquis de Sade (Patrick Magee).In point of fact  plays written by de Sade and performed by the inmates of Charenton actually took place. But Peter Brooks takes things to another level as he through the character of Sade poses many questions to the viewer while at the same time shocking the sense. Cleverly the actors are given parts that have something in common with their mental disorder.This is a musical but probably like no other musical you have ever seen. It is somewhat like some of the Mystery plays of the Middle Ages. There are plays with in plays, clever references made and word play, as like are found in the Mystery plays, to and regarding the actors themselves and the surroundings where they are performing.The play is about the death of Marat but it is within it is a larger play about the French Revolution. But the play is more than a history lesson. All through it the character playing Marat sits in a bathtub as Sade taunts him. Much of his taunts take the form of long philosophical soliloquies belittling Marat, the Revolution and society in general. Through out the play the inmates fall in and out of character to the symptoms of their various mental illnesses.The songs are incredibly well  integrated into the play and are quite witty and enjoyable -some of them almost joyous.Comically the director of the asylum, a condescending buffoon, interrupts the play time and again when statements are made that go against the current ideology.As the play about a revolution concludes a real  revolution starts behind the bars and the film ends in chaos.The final scene is a pan back  showing the audience at the bars in which the stage is enclosed. Are they clamoring to get in? Do they too want to be inmates? Do they want to become part of the free for all?Peter Brooks offers up a beautiful but disturbing movie and  vision of the world.",5,Brillaint and intense,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,2343,"['Marat', '/', 'Sade', 'incredible', 'theatrical', 'production', 'was', 'captured', 'well', 'film', 'Complaints', 'been', 'made', 'sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'though', 'well', 'founded', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'problem', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'appeared', 'theatres.The', 'movie', 'place', 'stage', 'bars', 'asylum', 'Charenton', 'bars', 'well', 'sit', 'confident', 'arrogant', 'ignorant', 'asylum', 'director', 'family', 'Performed', 'play', 'written', 'directed', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Sade', 'Patrick', 'Magee', '.In', 'point', 'fact', 'plays', 'written', 'de', 'Sade', 'performed', 'inmates', 'Charenton', 'actually', 'took', 'place', 'Peter', 'Brooks', 'things', 'level', 'character', 'Sade', 'poses', 'many', 'questions', 'viewer', 'same', 'time', 'shocking', 'sense', 'Cleverly', 'actors', 'are', 'given', 'parts', 'have', 'something', 'common', 'mental', 'disorder.This', 'musical', 'probably', 'other', 'musical', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'somewhat', 'like', 'Mystery', 'plays', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'are', 'plays', 'plays', 'clever', 'references', 'made', 'word', 'play', 'are', 'found', 'Mystery', 'regarding', 'actors', 'surroundings', 'where', 'are', 'performing.The', 'play', 'death', 'Marat', 'larger', 'play', 'French', 'Revolution', 'play', 'more', 'history', 'lesson', 'character', 'playing', 'Marat', 'sits', 'bathtub', 'Sade', 'Much', 'taunts', 'take', 'form', 'long', 'philosophical', 'soliloquies', 'belittling', 'Marat', 'Revolution', 'society', 'general', 'play', 'inmates', 'fall', 'character', 'symptoms', 'various', 'mental', 'illnesses.The', 'songs', 'are', 'incredibly', 'well', 'integrated', 'play', 'are', 'quite', 'witty', 'enjoyable', '-some', 'almost', 'joyous.Comically', 'director', 'asylum', 'condescending', 'buffoon', 'play', 'time', 'again', 'when', 'statements', 'are', 'made', 'go', 'current', 'ideology.As', 'play', 'revolution', 'real', 'revolution', 'bars', 'film', 'chaos.The', 'final', 'scene', 'pan', 'back', 'showing', 'audience', 'bars', 'stage', 'enclosed', 'Are', 'clamoring', 'get', 'Do', 'too', 'want', 'be', 'inmates', 'Do', 'want', 'become', 'part', 'free', 'Peter', 'Brooks', 'up', 'beautiful', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'vision', 'world']",Marat Sade

The play -and sometimes musical- is a reenactment of key events in France's tumultuous recent past. It dramatizes the French Revolution, its aftermath, and the eventual murder of revolutionary leader Jean-Paul Marat (Ian Richardson) by Charlotte Corday (Glenda Jackson) in 1793. Interspersed throughout the play are monologues by Marat and de Sade that articulate their conflicting socio-political ideologies.&quot;Marat/Sade&quot; is a movie of a play -indeed of a play within a play- that was performed by The Royal Shakespeare Company under the direction of Peter Brook in 1967. The play was originally written by playwright Peter Weiss and entitled &quot;The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum at Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade&quot;, which is an accurate, if cumbersome, title. &quot;Marat/ Sade&quot; is a film of that play, and it is filmed in a style that draws attention to the fact that we are watching a play. To put it bluntly, it is filmed more awkwardly than well. The style of the play/movie reflects some of the experimental fashions in the art world of the late 1960s. The performances are interesting and heartfelt, but more melodramatic than convincing. The actors are playing performers who suffer from various mental ailments who are in turn playing roles in a play. -Kind of like playing two characters at once. The behavior of the asylum's histrionic inmates sometimes seems to coincide with their particular mental conditions and sometimes seems to be an acting class exercise in various extreme but unlikely emotional states. The chorus and minor players are generic crazies: ugly, outrageous, and pitiful, who seem to exist primarily to be just that. The most interesting aspect of the film is its philosophical monologues by Jean-Paul Marat and the Marquis de Sade. The antics of the mental patients trying to stage a proper full-length play and occasionally being overcome by their madness are funny, but ultimately most of the film just seems like clutter between the far more coherent monologues.Like most experimental theater, &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; is more about spectacle than about presenting a credible story or characters. The Marquis de Sade actually was an inmate at the Asylum at Charenton. And he did write plays which were performed by his fellow inmates for visiting Parisian aristocrats. But those plays have not survived. Whatever de Sade's plays at Charenton were about, they almost certainly had philosophical underpinnings. &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; showcases the conflicting ideologies of The Marquis de Sade and Jean-Paul Marat, but it doesn't do it very well. Philosophy also plays second fiddle to spectacle. The monologues are disjointed and none of the ideas are complete. The film toys with themes here and there, and then drops them. Only the idea that humans are violent savages if left unchecked is expressed coherently. Ultimately, &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; has the feeling of something that actors, writers, and directors like to create because it exercises their abilities, but that audiences don't like to watch because it isn't valuable beyond that. It's a movie made for performing, not for viewing. In a nutshell, this is 1960s experimental theater. It you like that, you'll probably like this. If you don't, you won't.The DVD (This refers to the Image Entertainment DVD only.): The disc has very poor sound, as if some  dialogue simply wasn't miked. You'll have to turn the volume way up to hear some of the dialogue and then quickly back down so as not to be deafened. The sound badly needs to be remixed. This disc is full screen; the movie was filmed in a widescreen aspect ratio. Instead of compressing the wider image into a full screen ratio, the sides of the image have simply been chopped off. So you can't see what's going on in the periphery. There are no bonus features on the disc. Basically, this is a bad disc. Image Entertainment usually does better. But it looks like they're no longer producing it, so perhaps the MGM/UA disc is better.",3,More Spectacle than Substance.,1069545600,"11 23, 2003",2003,4437,"['1808', 'mental', 'institution', 'Charenton', 'Paris', 'France', 'patients', 'perform', 'play', 'visiting', 'audience', 'city', 'high', 'society', 'play', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'infamous', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Sade', 'Patrick', 'Magee', 'long-term', 'resident', 'asylum', 'known', 'Western', 'world', 'scandalous', 'philosophical', 'novels', 'play', '-and', 'sometimes', 'musical-', 'reenactment', 'key', 'events', 'France', 'tumultuous', 'recent', 'past', 'French', 'Revolution', 'aftermath', 'eventual', 'murder', 'revolutionary', 'leader', 'Jean-Paul', 'Marat', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'Charlotte', 'Corday', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', '1793', 'Interspersed', 'play', 'are', 'monologues', 'Marat', 'de', 'Sade', 'articulate', 'conflicting', 'socio-political', 'ideologies.', 'quot', 'Marat/Sade', 'quot', 'movie', 'play', '-indeed', 'play', 'play-', 'was', 'performed', 'Royal', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'direction', 'Peter', 'Brook', '1967', 'play', 'was', 'originally', 'written', 'playwright', 'Peter', 'Weiss', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Persecution', 'Assassination', 'Jean-Paul', 'Marat', 'Performed', 'Inmates', 'Asylum', 'Charenton', 'Direction', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Sade', 'quot', 'accurate', 'cumbersome', 'title', 'quot', 'Marat/', 'Sade', 'quot', 'film', 'play', 'filmed', 'style', 'attention', 'fact', 'are', 'watching', 'play', 'put', 'bluntly', 'filmed', 'more', 'awkwardly', 'well', 'style', 'play/movie', 'experimental', 'fashions', 'art', 'world', 'late', '1960s', 'performances', 'are', 'interesting', 'heartfelt', 'more', 'melodramatic', 'convincing', 'actors', 'are', 'playing', 'performers', 'who', 'suffer', 'various', 'mental', 'ailments', 'who', 'are', 'turn', 'playing', 'roles', 'play', 'playing', 'two', 'characters', 'once', 'behavior', 'asylum', 'histrionic', 'inmates', 'sometimes', 'coincide', 'particular', 'mental', 'conditions', 'sometimes', 'be', 'acting', 'class', 'exercise', 'various', 'extreme', 'unlikely', 'emotional', 'states', 'chorus', 'minor', 'players', 'are', 'generic', 'crazies', 'ugly', 'outrageous', 'pitiful', 'who', 'seem', 'exist', 'primarily', 'be', 'just', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'philosophical', 'monologues', 'Jean-Paul', 'Marat', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Sade', 'antics', 'mental', 'patients', 'trying', 'stage', 'proper', 'full-length', 'play', 'occasionally', 'being', 'overcome', 'madness', 'are', 'funny', 'ultimately', 'most', 'film', 'just', 'clutter', 'far', 'more', 'coherent', 'monologues.Like', 'most', 'experimental', 'theater', 'quot', 'Marat/Sade', 'quot', 'more', 'spectacle', 'presenting', 'credible', 'story', 'characters', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Sade', 'actually', 'was', 'inmate', 'Asylum', 'Charenton', 'did', 'write', 'plays', 'were', 'performed', 'fellow', 'inmates', 'visiting', 'Parisian', 'aristocrats', 'plays', 'have', 'not', 'survived', 'Sade', 'plays', 'Charenton', 'were', 'about', 'almost', 'certainly', 'had', 'philosophical', 'underpinnings', 'quot', 'Marat/Sade', 'quot', 'conflicting', 'ideologies', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Sade', 'Jean-Paul', 'Marat', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'well', 'Philosophy', 'also', 'second', 'fiddle', 'spectacle', 'monologues', 'are', 'disjointed', 'none', 'ideas', 'are', 'complete', 'film', 'themes', 'here', 'there', 'then', 'drops', 'Only', 'idea', 'humans', 'are', 'violent', 'savages', 'left', 'unchecked', 'expressed', 'coherently', 'Ultimately', 'quot', 'Marat/Sade', 'quot', 'feeling', 'something', 'actors', 'writers', 'directors', 'create', 'abilities', 'audiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'watch', ""n't"", 'valuable', 'movie', 'made', 'performing', 'not', 'viewing', 'nutshell', '1960s', 'experimental', 'theater', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", ""won't.The"", 'DVD', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'DVD', 'only', 'disc', 'very', 'poor', 'sound', 'dialogue', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'miked', ""'ll"", 'have', 'turn', 'volume', 'way', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'then', 'quickly', 'back', 'down', 'so', 'not', 'be', 'deafened', 'sound', 'badly', 'be', 'remixed', 'disc', 'full', 'screen', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Instead', 'compressing', 'wider', 'image', 'full', 'screen', 'ratio', 'sides', 'image', 'have', 'simply', 'been', 'chopped', 'off', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'going', 'periphery', 'are', 'bonus', 'disc', 'Basically', 'bad', 'disc', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'usually', 'better', ""'re"", 'longer', 'producing', 'so', 'perhaps', 'MGM/UA', 'disc', 'better']",Marat Sade

447767,A9AA6DFHYP7Q3,630508159X,Solo Goodspeed,"[9, 11]","What a joy to see this revolutionary work finally available on DVD!  British filmmaker Peter Brook takes the stark, naturalistic visual style he applied so effectively in his rendition of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, and envisions yet another society run amok - This time around, in the bathhouse turned theater of the absurd of the infamous asylum of Charenton, in which the even more infamous Marquis de Sade spent the last ten years of his life.The time setting is post-revolutionary France; the Age of Enlightenment, and of liberation.  Or is it?  This ragtag troupe of performers, consisting of paranoiacs, melancholiacs, perverts, schizos and all around &quot;social lepers&quot; seem to be the casualties of the Renaissance, creating the perfect metaphor of this filmed play-within-a-play.  The radical ideals of the revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat are pitted against the more cynical logic of author de Sade, amidst a sea of churning madness, resulting in an unsettling, confrontational and subversive work which poses uncomfortable questions about the good intentions that bring about social change.By turns icily philosophical and gut-level emotional, this was probably the first play/film to portray the Marquis de Sade as more of a political figure than the mere depraved smut peddler history had painted him.  Patrick Magee delivers an unforgettable portrait of the Marquis; Glenda Jackson's twitching, lurching Charlotte Corday is an equally memorable film debut; Ian Richardson's Marat is intense, haunting and tormented; and the Royal Shakespeare Company's supporting cast of &quot;inmates&quot; is disturbingly convincing.Perhaps more potentially controversial at the time of its release in 1966, the era of Vietnam disillusionment, Marat/Sade still does a great job of exposing the wrinkles in our supposedly more evolved age, and as such remains a strong and timely work.  Please note: there are TWO DVD versions available ..... this one is the widescreen transfer, it looks and sounds immaculate, and if you are as much a fan of this film as I am, you are in for an ecstatic viewing experience.  So do not be alarmed by the claims of other reviewers bemoaning a grainy pan-and-scan transfer.  Also. contrary to what another viewer wrote, this movie was NOT filmed on the New York stage, though that's what it was intended to look like.  The multiple perspectives created by director Brook mirror the socio-philosophical multiple perspecives portrayed by playwright Weiss, which work well together to give this title its provocative punch.  A primal scream that will echo in the thinking person's mind for some time, Marat/Sade boasts flawless performances, hallucinogenic cinematography and yes, even a smattering of catchy tunes ..... a richly satisfying film on several levels, for the more cerebrally adventurous.",5,"We're All Normal, and We Want Our Freedom",999475200,"09 3, 2001",2001,2836,"['What', 'joy', 'see', 'revolutionary', 'work', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'British', 'filmmaker', 'Peter', 'Brook', 'stark', 'naturalistic', 'visual', 'style', 'applied', 'so', 'effectively', 'rendition', 'quot', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'quot', 'envisions', 'yet', 'society', 'run', 'amok', 'time', 'around', 'bathhouse', 'turned', 'theater', 'absurd', 'infamous', 'asylum', 'Charenton', 'even', 'more', 'infamous', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Sade', 'spent', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'life.The', 'time', 'setting', 'post-revolutionary', 'France', 'Age', 'Enlightenment', 'liberation', 'ragtag', 'troupe', 'performers', 'consisting', 'paranoiacs', 'melancholiacs', 'perverts', 'schizos', 'quot', 'social', 'lepers', 'quot', 'seem', 'be', 'casualties', 'Renaissance', 'creating', 'perfect', 'metaphor', 'filmed', 'play-within-a-play', 'radical', 'ideals', 'revolutionary', 'Jean-Paul', 'Marat', 'are', 'pitted', 'more', 'cynical', 'logic', 'author', 'de', 'Sade', 'sea', 'churning', 'madness', 'resulting', 'unsettling', 'confrontational', 'subversive', 'work', 'uncomfortable', 'questions', 'good', 'intentions', 'bring', 'about', 'social', 'change.By', 'icily', 'philosophical', 'gut-level', 'emotional', 'was', 'probably', 'first', 'play/film', 'portray', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Sade', 'more', 'political', 'figure', 'mere', 'depraved', 'smut', 'peddler', 'history', 'had', 'painted', 'Patrick', 'Magee', 'unforgettable', 'portrait', 'Marquis', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'twitching', 'lurching', 'Charlotte', 'Corday', 'equally', 'memorable', 'film', 'debut', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'Marat', 'intense', 'haunting', 'tormented', 'Royal', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'supporting', 'cast', 'quot', 'quot', 'disturbingly', 'convincing.Perhaps', 'more', 'potentially', 'controversial', 'time', 'release', '1966', 'era', 'Vietnam', 'disillusionment', 'Marat/Sade', 'still', 'great', 'job', 'exposing', 'wrinkles', 'supposedly', 'more', 'evolved', 'age', 'such', 'strong', 'timely', 'work', 'Please', 'note', 'are', 'TWO', 'DVD', 'versions', 'available', 'one', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'immaculate', 'are', 'as', 'much', 'fan', 'film', 'am', 'are', 'ecstatic', 'viewing', 'experience', 'So', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'alarmed', 'claims', 'other', 'reviewers', 'bemoaning', 'grainy', 'pan-and-scan', 'transfer', 'Also', 'contrary', 'what', 'viewer', 'wrote', 'movie', 'was', 'NOT', 'filmed', 'New', 'York', 'stage', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'look', 'multiple', 'perspectives', 'created', 'director', 'Brook', 'socio-philosophical', 'multiple', 'perspecives', 'portrayed', 'playwright', 'Weiss', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'give', 'title', 'provocative', 'punch', 'primal', 'scream', 'will', 'echo', 'thinking', 'person', 'mind', 'time', 'Marat/Sade', 'flawless', 'performances', 'hallucinogenic', 'cinematography', 'yes', 'even', 'smattering', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'richly', 'satisfying', 'film', 'several', 'levels', 'more', 'cerebrally', 'adventurous']",Marat Sade
447768,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,630508159X,Westley,"[22, 22]","This 1966 film depicts the Marquis de Sade's imprisonment in a mental asylum and a play that he directs using the other inmates as actors.  The story of Sade was recently related in ""Quills,"" and that film is somewhat similar in tone, but not plot.  Believe it or not, the film is also a musical!  The ""play"" within the movie chronicles events from the French Revolution pertaining to Marat, and is put on for the asylum's leader and the local gentry.  The local gentry are shocked at times, and the asylum leader interrupts the play several times with interjections concerning the play's radical ideas and how the gentry are depicted.  As the play reaches its culmination, the inmates inevitably begin to stage their own revolution.  The action is often confusing, but the emotions conveyed are so intense, that the film can be enjoyed on a visceral level.The direction of this film is quite brilliant, and it must have been pretty shocking when it was released 36 years ago.  The acting is also very intense and realistic.  Glenda Jackson has her starring debut here and is quite appealing, considering that she's playing a mental asylum inmate.  The only quibble I have with the DVD is the poor sound quality.  Even on DVD, the sound is muddled and the actor's dialogue is often unintelligible, especially during the songs.  Unfortunately, the DVD does not include captions/subtitles, which would have helped immensely (there are no other extras either).
