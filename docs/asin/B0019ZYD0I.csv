It's pretty sad this funny sitcom only lasted five little seasons. Tisha Campbell is rarely seen, she had issues with Lawrence and would only finish the finale if Martin agreed to keep his distance from her. This season is bittersweet, they are still some hilarious moments but the cast who had excellent chemistry the first 4 seasons is now gone and you can feel it.

Clark ""MusiMan""","[12, 12]","This is actually a pretty solid season considering the controversy and the so-called sexual harrassment that Tisha filed, supposedly. I watched that second episode of this season and it didn't look like she had such a problem with it, hair all messed up and whatnot. Besides, she was in more episodes; actually half the season she was in more episodes so I don't know how credible her story is.This season could've been way worse without her but after all, it is Martin Lawrence's show and he held it up on his own with the supporting cast. Everybody else in the principal cast got more room to breath and shine. It would've been nice to see more of his other characters, although the 2nd time that Sheneneh came up was in my one of my favorite episodes where she tries to sue Tommy as Mark Cooper as her lawyer. David Alan Grier came back. This season went off without a hitch.But....i could tell from the first episode that things were different, the energy was different, the chemistry was different and Martin was different. Then about the second disc in, he looked and acted a little too TOO serious with his facial expressions, there was almost a darkness to him or something. Some of the episodes and material was a bit too weak like the halloween episode with haunted house, the episode where the marriage license is wrong and the white girl episode. I could tell by the second disc that they were starting to run out of ideas but like i said it could've been worse and Martin held up pretty well.

Most of the episodes were getting to be more stupid before she left and it took on to a whole other level after she left.  Some episodes I do like such as the Prince Oochie episode and the Jury Duty episode plus a very few, but thats it.  It was clear that Martin no longer appeared as his other alter egos (besides Shenehneh twice), but the show had officially jumped the shark and writers had just ran out of fresh new ideas.  Jokes were getting old at that point (the 90's are almost over...get with the times).
