Everest DisasterWhile the book is a compelling personal account, the made-for-TV movie is gloppy, plodding melodrama. The movie is incredibly simplistic. There's Nat Parker as the judicious Rob Hall, Peter Horton as the reckless Scott Fischer, and Christopher Macdonald as the author Jon Krakauer. Krakauer's role in this movie is to provide all the moralizing&be; the overbearing narrator. The lessons end up being ""don't have sex on Mount Everest past Base Camp"" and ""don't stay on the summit past 2 pm.""While the book is engrossing&explains; the complexities of the situation (there were also expeditions from Taiwan&South; Africa)... the movie has one-dimensional characters.

I then discovered a movie, this movie, was made. It took some time to get a copy, and when I finally had opportunity to watch it with my girlfriend, I fell asleep (not really a comment about the movie, but the excessive hours I was working).So now, I've watched it. And... it was clearly in trouble right off the start. In a story ABOUT how several people died on the mountain, the movie often STOPs to remind us with the narration,  that '5 people will die'. The producers obviously recognized thier inability to recreate the actual drama that happened.  I say, &quot;Don't tell me, SHOW ME&quot;. After several scenes I was left wondering if I hadn't read the book if I would really understand what was happening.Catch this movie on some tv channel at night. Definitely READ Jon Krakauer's book, or even listen to the audio tape or cd. Or wish someone with ability would take this story and make a good or even great movie from the story.",2,Ah Man!

The movie suffers greatly from the very things that mountainclimbers cannot do -- rush.  The movie pushes along at a relentless pace using fade to white as a time compression device.  The movie never takes its time until its way too late.  We can't decompress that fast!The dialogue and acting suffer from the made-for-TV feel, and the plot comes across as something closer to one of Reader's Digests' ""Drama in Real Life"" instead of Krakauer's prose.  Sure there are a few emotional moments and points where they ""get it right,"" but they are too few and far between.  The movie is so rushed we don't have time to care about the characters presented.  Ironically I thought Imax's ""Everest,"" even with its documentary feel, was far more moving.Of course I also did this movie a disservice by seeing it back to back with ""Touching the Void"" an immensely superior film.

Although the screening, acting,  technical parameters of the filming were not that impressive, the crude reality of a tough mountain, altitude sickness and the necesity of team work are expressed at most.  Cristopher McDonald's performance wasn't bad at all and check out the khumbu ice fall and Hillary pass scenification;  come on, you can't have better than that.  Please don't mention Vertical Limit wich I consider a looney toon story compared to this movie or some cliffhanger nickaround wich gives you nothing but a waste of time.Perhaps, producers should put on a side Mount Everest and think about making a REAL!! movie about K2 wich I consider the toughest mountain ever to climb (what a shame vertical limit became the greatest insult to the K2 mountain).  Although there is a fine movie about it (starring Michael Biehn and Matt Craven) I'm still waiting for a movie that can bring us the real shot to mountanier live:  extreme danger, 90 rock walls, deadly avalanches and many nature-against situations that put human lives in a thin line.I personally recomend Into thin air, death on everest.Juan M.

12222,A2BRSYSJO4L7VV,0767814908,"Ken ""KC Music Fan""","[21, 23]","Having read Jon Krakauer's Everest memoir, Into Thin Air, I decided to get the DVD of the movie.  The movie version of Jon's book isn't bad, but I think it falls just a little short of Jon's written account of his climb up Everest in '96.In the movie, Christopher McDonald plays Jon; Nat Parker plays Rob Hall, the leader of Jon's Everest climb; and Peter Horton plays Scott Fischer, the leader of a rival group of climbers.  As in the book, the movie details how a lack of oxygen, small mistakes, and Rob and Scott's eagerness to get to the top--and pressing on despite storms brewing near Everest's summit--combined to cause the disaster.  Among the mistakes laid out in the movie were Scott's Sherpa guide Lopsang towing climber Sandy Pittman by rope even though he hadn't been instructed to do so and Jon's fellow climber Andy Harris accidentally turning up the regulator on Jon's oxygen tank full blast while suffering forgetfulness brought on by a lack of oxygen.  Also, Rob disregarded his own turnaround time of 2:00 p.m., which everybody on his team had agreed to so that they'd have time to get back down safely even if not all of them reached the top of Everest by that time.  Indeed, as depicted in the book and the movie, Jon and his guide Mike Groom were the only two people from Jon's expedition who reached the summit and then got off Everest alive.  However, the movie also includes the inspiring story of Jon's colleague Beck Weathers, who, despite nearly dying from frostbite, walked into camp one day after everyone had given up on him and eventually recovered.  Beck, as the ending shows, lost his right hand and all the fingers on his left hand and underwent the reconstruction of his nose, but he still was able to return to his work as a doctor.  The most memorable scenes are Beck's near-death experience and miraculous recovery; the scene where Jon ran out and banged on pots and pans to guide the climbers who had gotten lost after the disastrous storm on Everest; Rob's dying phone conversation with his wife, Jan, who was pregnant and was talking to him from New Zealand; and the closing scene, the memorial service at Everest Base Camp for the climbers who perished on the mountain.  The scenery is majestic, and I got a sense of the climbers' desperation as they struggled just to survive on Everest.However, the movie version of Into Thin Air, in my opinion, doesn't do the book justice.  For one thing, the movie was mainly concerned with what happened on Everest and not how the characters got there.  To be sure, it's hard to get all the details of a book into a 90-minute to two-hour movie.  However, in the movie version of Into Thin Air, we don't really get to know the characters personally.  There's just a brief exposition before the climbing scenes commence.  This is unfortunate because in reality, once they got into Nepal, Jon and his fellow climbers spent quite a while on the trail on the way to Base Camp.  Also, Jon and his colleagues, once they got to Base Camp, spent three weeks there before making their summit bid, using that time to make several forays above Base Camp in order to get fully acclimated. A lot of the characters aren't really well-developed either.  In my opinion, Rob, Nat Parker's character, is more interesting than Jon(as played by Christopher McDonald) or Scott(as Peter Horton portrays him).  Rob's New Zealand humor provides occasional comic relief for an otherwise dull--and eventually tragic--situation.  Also, since we hear Rob talking to his wife on the phone just before he dies, we get a sense of how much he loved his family.  We don't hear Jon conversing with his wife back in the United States, even though in the book, he and Linda had phone conversations on numerous occasions--and Jon, in the book, is the protagonist and author!  I think, too, that the movie understates Jon's emotional reactions to what happened.  In the book, Jon was overcome with grief and guilt at the loss of his friends.  In the movie he's portrayed as a self-absorbed guy who went up the mountain because of personal ambition--and when his friends(Andy, Rob, Scott, Doug Hansen, and Yasuko Namba) start dying, we don't see him exhibit any anguish.  Indeed, in the movie, Jon cracks up only twice:  the first time when he is standing over Rob's frozen body, and again at the very end, when he talks about his dead friends at the Base Camp memorial service.  The movie's portrayal of Jon, in my opinion, is demeaning.  In the book Jon wanted to get up Everest very badly--almost at the exclusion of anything else--but he still grieved for his friends.  Furthermore, I think that in at least one place in the movie, there's some obvious stretching of the truth.  The scene where I most doubt the credibility of director Robert Markowitz and writer Robert Avrech is the scene where Jon, having failed to rescue Rob, discovers the latter's frozen body.  In the written account, Jon did not try to go after Rob because he(Jon) was shivering in his tent and concerned with his own survival.  Anatoli Boukreev, a guide on Scott's team, was the one who coordinated most of the rescue attempts on the mountain.  Rob's body was actually found some time later by climbers Ed Viesturs and David Breashears as they were making their way to the top of Everest.  Also, I think the filmmakers' portrayal of Anatoli, one of the heroes of the expedition, is off base, although the movie truthfully recounts his heroism in the wake of the storm.  Anatoli, as Jon wrote, was a dedicated guide who helped find several of the climbers who were lost, even though he had to descend ahead of his teammates because his rescue attempts used up a lot of his oxygen.  Markowitz and Avrech portray Anatoli as a ""he-man"" type--boorish, uncooperative, and sometimes argumentative.  In one scene, Anatoli and Scott get into a heated fight over Anatoli's responsibilities as a guide.  Although Anatoli got criticized for the way he did his job and for descending ahead of his team after the storm, I didn't see any open hostility between him and Scott when I read the book.  Another discrepancy between the book and the movie is that in the book, Rob didn't see the Taiwanese climber as the climber came out of his tent shod only in his boot liners and slid down the mountain to his death.  The Taiwanese group was on Everest at the same time as Rob's and Scott's teams but didn't go up the mountain at the same time.  Finally, the movie stops after the memorial service and doesn't include Jon's adjusting to life back in the United States.  I concede that the movie is an abridged version of Jon's book.  However, in real life, Jon had to deal not only with missing his dead friends and getting used to being at home again but with the hate mail he received after writing the magazine article which was the impetus for his book.  As Jon wrote, the hatred coming from the pens of his critics made the aftermath of his Everest climb even harder to deal with than it already was.  Markowitz and Avrech completely overlooked this part of Jon's story--and I think that the criticism Jon received, not just for the role he played in the deaths of his friends but for going up Everest in the first place, was a key element in his book.  Still, as an adventure story, the movie Into Thin Air is not great, but it's all right.  The movie, like the book, shows us how people react in a desperate situation and how even little things we do can have big consequences.",3,"OK, but doesn't live up to Jon's account",1118448000,"06

Instead, they are caricatures of those whom they purport to be.One expedition leader, the late Scott Fischer, comes across as a mellow, disorganized, bumbling dude. One of his expedition guides, the late Anatoli Boukreev, is depicted as a self centered, Neanderthal like he-man, who clearly differs with his boss on what his role as a guide is to be.Another expedition leader, the late Rob Hall, fares somewhat better, in that he is portrayed as an organized, stand up expedition leader, who puts the welfare of his clients above his own. His much publicized radio farewll to his pregnant wife is included as part of the drama.Socialite Sandy Hill Pittman seems to represent conspicuous consumption and is depicted as a self-absorbed, rich bitch with little regard for the Sherpas whom she treats as little more than human yaks. Texan Beck Weathers fares little better, as he is characterized as a buffoon. I am sure that, were he to see this movie, he would wish that they'd have left him on Everest.The actor who plays Jon Krakauer's character has the thankless role of Greek chorus. He is there to basically tie up loose ends in the movie. He portrays Krakauer as a dour, humorless human being who, were it not for the fact that he is a talented writer, would have been pushed off the Lhotse face of Everest by some enterprising soul. Last, but certainly not least, are the Sherpas, who are shown as wise, brave, put upon souls. Now here, the movie is hitting its mark.The cinematography is laughable. Numerous shots of a mountain purporting to be Everest are easily spotted as shots of a mountain other than Everest. Since when is Everest without its signature tell tale plume, waving banner like in the sky?Let me cut to the chase. Read the well written book upon which the movie is based, &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; by Jon Krakauer.

Although the script doesn't flesh out the characters enough for us to truly empathize with their emotions, there is enough real drama in some of the characters to inspire such empathy.  Rob (played quite well by Nat Parker) is an interesting character and his final scene with his pregnant wife, is heartbreaking, and acted remarkably well.

Everest during a storm.  The film is not a great piece of cinema drama or even suspense.  The character development is a little shallow and the acting a tad weak.  I have not read the Krakauer book but my guess is that it is much better.  I imagine this might sound a tad mean but I was actually happy when a few people died (in the movie not real life) because they were being brash and annoying.Still the film is entertaining because I think it captures the dangers of climbing when you do not follow through with the game plan and act like a total bafoon, which the film recreates.  I do not know if this was the real situation for the climbers.  It seems like some of the individuals climbing should not have been a part of the expedition on Everest.  If you want to know what not to do when climbing Everest, watch this film.
