It's unnecessary  to say more words about the masterpieces &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and  &quot;Manhattan&quot;. Their place in the film history books is certain.  Another film of the collection is the underrated &quot;Interiors&quot;,  which might not be funny, but a well observed, subtle, bergmanesque drama.  &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; was also treated in an inappropriately  hostile way when it was released.I already said in my reviews of  &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot;, that I  consider Woody Allen as one of the funniest, wittiest and finest  filmmakers. It's really a pity that his latest films are all struggling to  find an audience.

Marold""","[19, 22]","This collection of Woody Allen written and directed movies is well chosen in that it begins with his second writer / director effort and includes all eight in a row from that point on. The included films are:BananasEverything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex but Were Afraid to AskSleeperLove and DeathAnnie HallInteriorsManhattanStardust MemoriesThis selection is great for a complete Woody Allen fan, but it has some drawbacks to people who are entertained by his comedies, but find nothing of interest in his other movies. And, there is no more `other movies' film than `Interiors', which has not a single joke, gag, laugh, or snicker. That is not to mean it is not pure Woody, as all of his most popular themes such as sex, death, creative freeze-up, parents, and relationships between partners.`Stardust Memories' is also an `other movie', however, it is on more familiar ground as a parody with jokes. If fact, one can say that the object of parody in `Stardust Memories' is the earlier seven movies and Allen himself.The one other movie worth noting in this context is `Love and Death'. Amazon's published review of the collection describes this movie as underrated. I think it is more accurate to say that it is much less well known, almost totally overshadowed by the earlier comedies and the great success of `Annie Hall'. In fact, I am almost inclined to guess that some of the changes toward more serious characters and plot may have come as a result of critical ennui with `Love and Death', even though these are by far two of Allen's most pregnant topics. I believe it is not `Love and Death' but `Stardust Memories' which is underrated.For Allen fans and wannabe Allen fans, this is a great collection. For people who just happen to like his funny movies, do the math to see if the discounted price for the collection means you are getting `Interiors' and maybe `Love and Death' for free. Personally, I feel there are no losers in this collection, but that's me. I just don't know why they didn't bother to start with the first movie, `Take the Money and Run', since it is distributed by MGM, just like all the others.",5,Excellent Collection with a reservation.

Yes, ""Annie Hall"" is a kick, but compared to ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" ""Hannah and Her Sisters,"" and ""Deconstructing Harry,"" it must be seen as a young work, well-conceived, but lacking the depth of his more mature work. Others disagree, of course, and why not? There are numerous bright spots in these films. Certainly ""Manhattan"" is a unique love-poem to the city. Woody's preoccupation with Dostoevsky is shown to great affect in ""Love and Death,"" but all in all I prefer his late work, and believe that Mia Farrow played a crucial role in inspiring his mature phase. Woody himself has expressed reservations for his work overall. There are indeed limitations, and it is doubtful that he will ever be compared to the greats. But he is certainly great enough for me.

154914,AOPPHDPD830VJ,0792846052,"Holy Olio ""holy_olio""","[52, 78]","__________________Annie Hall is one of the best films of the 1970s, in some ways it defined them. Woody outdid himself, and yet it really was just the first of his ""real"" movies. Without this one, well, never mind, I can't bear to contemplate that. This is often rated as one of the best American movies ever made. I'd like to warn you that it has no chase scenes or shootouts, no hostages get taken, no wrongly-convicted criminals try to break out of jail, and no one says ""excellent"" or high-fives. It's just a good film. If you don't have an ounce of heart or have a poor ability to remember premarital affairs, you may not like it. Otherwise you will.Manhattan - Not only one of Woody Allen's best movies, one of the best movies, period. While Annie Hall is a great movie, the development of Allen's talent between AH and Manhattan is startling. The chemistry of the cast is a factor in its success. The humor is smoothly integrated into the dialogue and not distracting. The scenes are well acted, shot, and edited. It's a love story in which the only mature participant is a 17 year old.Interiors - Not much music in the soundtrack, which contributes to the somber feel of this film. Despite some of the critical rejection of it, and despite the Bergman influence, this is one of his finest. I remember seeing this reviewed by Gene Shalit who was nearly speechless (not much of a change, since he was doing those 30 second reviews for Today back then) and in awe. The performances were natural and believable, and the cast were well chosen. This film may appear derivative, but I found it to be innovative and original, and couldn't take my eyes off it, despite the deliberate drabness.Stardust Memories is one of Woody's most underrated films, stronger than any of his ""early, funny ones"" and is very cohesive, particularly with repeated viewings. The gags have more impact because most of the movie is stress and strain. There's a jail scene (a common element in Woody's films - off the top of my head, there are at least four other movies with some form of confinement), three different breakups, and its flashbacks anticipates the recent ""Deconstructing Harry"". Stardust Memories was in part a kiss-off to critics of ""Interiors"". It's shot in black and white, has a great cast and performances, has unexplained props (like a cervical collar), Laraine Newman (first cast of SNL), Brent Spiner (Commander Data in ST:TNG), and the most graceful integration of Woody's childhood memories. This is a movie best experienced more than once -- another thing it has in common with ""Deconstructing Harry"".Love and Death is one that I've only seen once, and it didn't make much of an impact on me. A friend of mine considers this the best of Woody's funny movies, and he's the one who loaned it to me. I found it a little too gag-filled, although I must admit that I fell asleep a few times.Sleeper is a more sophisticated version of Bananas. Although it also gets preachy, it looks better on the screen, has better gags, and superficially is a great send-up of science fiction of all kinds. I love the bit about health food.Bananas is poorly shot, preachy, and not too funny, which is odd because it's one of the ""early, funny ones"". I know people who mistakenly think of this as his finest work. [...]Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex but Were Afraid to Ask is one of his classic funny ones, but having seen it I don't see anything much to recommend it. The gags look like things he based on his stage act that may have been daring during the Bitter End years. [...]Now that we know what is in the second Woody box, the main question to ask is ""why?""

Annie Hall and Manhattan are both top notch, followed by Bananas, Everything you wanted to Know about Sex, Sleeper...heck, even Interiors was such a radical departure its worth seeing at least once or twice. But to me the real diamonds in the rough of this set are Stardust Memories and Love and Death. These two films are probably Woody's least talked about, but really, I think they are both fantastic films. Love and Death is full of the witty one liners and pratfalls that were prevelant in his &quot;earlier, funnier&quot; works... but you can see in the dialogue of Love and Death that Woody was maturing.

Like it or not Woody Allen does comedy, not drama.  His attempts at drama, while not disastrous are far from overwhelming and now knowing more about the man and his pedophile/incest like behavior makes some of his films down right icky.Still this set has some of his greatest comedies and is the best set of the lot.

154918,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,0792846052,K. Gordon,"[3, 3]","This collection is currently the only way to get reasonably priced new region 1 copies of some of Allen's greatest and most important films, including  ""Love and Death"", and others.  I can only hope that these films keep oddly going in and out out of print in anticipation of an upgraded re-release (hopefully blu-ray?), but there's always the danger that they've gotten caught up in some sort of rights war, in which case this it could be a while before these films reappear, and grabbing this set now makes even more sense.At the current price its less than $6 a film, for a collection of brilliant early work by one of America's most important film makers, its an amazing deal.On the other hand, you may end up feeling the need to 'double dip', since the new blu-rays of 'Manhattan' and 'Annie Hall' are both a solid step up in visual quality (although the DVDs are quite good).My brief reviews of each, on a 4 star scale;Bananas  (1971) ***1/2  Incredibly funny, broad, slapstick, surreal political satire as Woody takes over a Latin American country to impress a girl. A few bits feel dated, and it didn't make me laugh quite as much as 'Take the Money and Run' when I recently re-watched Allen's 'early funny films', but it still has more than it's share of great comic moments. The whole trial sequence is genius worthy of the very best of the Marx Brothers. (Or, in a more modern context Monty Python).  Personally I don't love the score -- it tends to underline jokes that don't need the help. It was after this that Allen went away from having music written for his films, using existing pieces instead, which became a huge part of his filmmaking style.Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (1972) *** While all the early Woody Allen films are funny and worthwhile, this is probably the most uneven to my taste. Allen took the famous, serious non-fiction book about sex, and turned it into a series of short comedy pieces. A couple segments are pure genius (inside the male body during sex, Gene Wilder falling in love with a sheep), a couple are pretty good (Woody as a medieval court jester trying to have an affair with the queen, who is locked into a chastity belt, a mad scientist creates a giant milk squirting breast that goes on a rampage) and a few are real duds.  Also, of all the Allen films, this might have the weakest DVD print/transfer quality.Sleeper (1973) ***3/4 While all of Allen's early comedies are pretty wonderful, this film represents a big leap in technical proficiency. For the first time you sense him really thinking about how the camera is telling the story. And in finding Diane Keaton, Allen was finally paired with an actress who's comedic strengths were a great match for his.  This film relies less on verbal jokes (although there are brilliant lines) and more on visual gags. It almost feels like you're watching a great silent comedy at times.  Better music too, with jazz taking over from traditional score the first time in Allen's films.  A funny, inventive, sophisticated if sometimes wonderfully silly comedy, with almost no dead moments. For me it represents the beginning of the shift from Allen as a brilliantly funny writer and comic who happened to make films, to becoming one of our very best filmmakers.Love and Death (1975) ****  I'm not surprised this was rumored to be Allen's favorite film. I'd say it's the best of his flat out comedies. All the strengths he was gathering as a filmmaker came together in this brilliant satire of (among other things) 19th century Russian literature, war, epic films about war, Ingmar Bergman, etc. etc. It's very very smart, and very very funny.  An amazing mix of sophisticated intellectual verbal comedy, parody, low and high-brow visual gags (from speeded up film of bopping a character repeatedly over the head with a bottle, to homages to great images from early Russian films) , terrific cinematography, and some real ideas, both political and philosophical.  Diane Keaton is wonderful, and fully comes into her own as Allen's on screen equal partner. And the look of the film shows the deep visual sophistication that would become a hallmark of the next phase of Allen's career; Annie Hall, Manhattan, etc.  With this film Allen completed his journey from brilliant joke teller to brilliant director-writer. It would be his next film, Annie Hall, that would make the world realize he was a world class filmmaker. But you can see the all groundwork laid here, and have a lot of fun in the process.Annie Hall (1977)**** Quite simply one of the best films about romantic relationships ever made. Brilliantly written. Brilliantly acted -- Diane Keaton is tremendous, the supporting cast is full of gems and Allen himself takes the leap to present himself as a real (if funny) human being and not a walking joke. And brilliantlyphotographed by the great Gordon Willis of 'The Godfather' and many of most important films of the 70s and 80s. Wildly funny and ultimately heartbreaking. It's hard to imagine anyone who has ever been in love, or struggled through grown-up relationships NOT identifying with a lot of this film. I loved it in my late teens when it first came out, and I love it even more 32 years later. Every time I see it I notice different details, depending on my own current life experiences. A film of enormous wit, humor, invention, and understanding of the human heart. Its completely unique, playful and idiosyncratic in style and approach, but that experimentation somehow only makes it more accessible and universal. If you haven't seen it, you owe yourself a try, even if you're not a Woody Allen 'fan'. And if you saw it long ago, it may be time for another look.Interiors (1978) ***1/4 A totally serious, almost theatrical examination of the meltdown of a rich, WASPy family might seem worlds away from anything Allen's earlier films prepared us for, but for the most part he's very up to the task, creating a gallery of disturbing and unforgettable moments and characters. Yes, it's derivative of Bergman, but it's also pretty damn good. Beautifully photographed by Gordon Willis, with amazing performances (Geraldine Page, Mary Beth Hurt, Maureen Stapleton in particular are brilliant, but everyone is good). The script does border on clich&eacute; at moments, and some specific dialogue is clunky, but there's something deeply moving and hard to shake in it's overall final effect. Under appreciated in its time, it's faults now seem very forgivable, and there's excitement in watching a great filmmaker stretch his talent in a new direction.Manhattan (1979) ***3/4 One of the most stunningly beautiful to look at films of the last 50 years, made with great wit, and full of strong observations about loss, aging, and how we lie to ourselves. Still, it doesn't quite rise to the level of `Annie Hall' for me in terms of timelessness or emotional impact. A film I really, really like, respect, see why others have it on their '10 best of all time' lists, etc. but feel guilty that I can't flat out love. Somehow all the adult characters' self-obsessed narcissism keeps me at arms length. I identify with moments, but -- unlike Annie Hall - not the whole. That said, it's strengths are so strong, and it has affected so many so deeply that I would say its a film any film lover owes themselves the chance to see. If nothing else, Gordon Willis' photography will leave you with images you'll never forget.Stardust Memories (1980)****  II know -- I'm supposed to like 'Manhattan' more. I know -- this straddles the line between homage and rip-off when it comes toFellini... But it's so physically beautiful, and so full of unforgettable moments of humor and heartbreak, that I can watch it over and over and just see more and more in it. It's an odd, wonderful mix of sad, angry, surreal and very funny. It's a chilling, hysterical look at the emptiness of being famous, at what it means to not trust your own worth as an artist, what it means to be scared of happiness.  The jump cut sequence with Charlotte Rampling is one of the best, most incisive pieces of film-making I've ever seen. Period.  For me, it's a tragically underrated film. This is brave, unique, special film-making in a world with far too little.",5,A collection of brilliant films - some out of print otherwise - for a great price,1276992000,"06 20,

It moves on through 1972's Everything You Wanted  To Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid To Ask); 1973's sci-fi, Keaton-  (Buster, not Diane) inspired masterpiece Sleeper; the last of his purely  slapstick comedies, the albsolutely wonderful Love And Death from 1975.  It  then moves on to his more intellectual and move acclaimed Annie Hall from  1977 (the only one of these already available in the DVD format); his 1978  Bergmanesque drama Interiors; the 1979's lovingly made black-and-white  Manhattan and finishing with 1980's Stardust Memories.

154928,AN1TWSCJO0R0P,0792846052,Rene,"[0, 0]","There are several reasons to buy this collection of earlier Woody Allen films.  First, it's an excellent buy and an easy way to add substance to your DVD collection.  More importantly, it gives you an opportunity to own  several movies you will enjoy watching again and again.Following the  films chronologically you see Allen's progression from slapstick comedy to  more character-driven humor.  One is not better than the other, but the  humor in later films, like Manhattan, is more subtle and sophisticated.  Some would argue that Allen's best movies, including Hannah and Her  Sisters, were made after the films compiled here.  And, they may be right.  But, you see here the evolution of an artist and the seed for those films.  For Woody Allen fans and lovers of New York, these earlier films are  required viewing.There is something to be said for each of the films  in the collection.  And, full reviews of each film are available elsewhere.  However, one thing that is consistently enjoyable in all of the films is  the quality of the performances given.  The best example is what a joy it  is to watch Diane Keaton in each of the films in which she appears.  She is  a wonderful actor.  And, for people like me who aren't big fans of Mia  Farrow, this collection is &quot;Mia free.&quot;It is hard for me to  imagine who wouldn't enjoy most if not all of the movies here.  And, with  the low per-film cost, there is little risk in owning them all.  I look  forward to a compilation in the future that includes Radio Days, Hannah and  Her Sisters, Broadway Danny Rose and Mighty Aphrodite.

154929,AECXFCX8CW6HE,0792846052,"Ryan Anonymus ""Ryan""","[12, 15]","This box set features Woody Allen's movies of the 70's (not counting 'Play it Again, Sam' and 'The Front'.  These DVDs don't feature any special features - except for the trailers, and the sound is in mono.  But an informitive two-page book comes with each movie.'Bananas' is one the early comedy greats:  with Woody traveling to a South American country and getting involved in the dictatorship politics there, including the rebels against the dictators.'Everything you always to know about sex...' involved seven silly segments.  One involving an affair with a sheep, one with a transvestite story, but the best was the last one where the characters are people inside a persons' brain - giving orders to other parts of the body.  Woody has a good character in that sequence.'Sleeper' was a Rip Van Winkle story.  Woody's character awakens after 200 years of suspended animation in a world that has ""martial law"".  Woody's character is persued throughout the movie, as well as the leading lady in the show - Diane Keaton (making her second Woody movie performance).  This film was awful silly, worth checking out.  In one scene, we get to see the power of futuristic fertilizer.'Love and Death' came next.  A story of going to war, in the time of Napolean.  This was the first movie that started to intigrate seriousness into it.  A good mix of comedy and philosiphy.  In one brief scene - we see a ""town fool"" convention.'Annie Hall' was Woody's big Oscar winning movie.  A tale of couples in New York - Woody and his girlfriend (played by Diane Keaton).  The film goes through certain stages that some couples deal with in relationships.  The film became a little too real for me, reminding me of my own past at points.  A fantasic display the many stages of relationships.  You can always expect some good neurotic characters in Woody's movie, and neurotic relationships.  This film's story has been said to do with Diane Keaton's real life -- her real last name is Hall!  She had to use the name 'Keaton' because there was already a Diane Hall is the acting world.'Interiors' was my least favorite from this set, mainly because there was no comedy in this one - and also no Woody Allen role.  But the seriousness of this film grabbed me, I'm not saying that it wasn't a good film.  The film deals with the story of a couple in their late 50's-early 60's getting a divorce, on the husband's request.  The wife has a hard time dealing with the break-up - to the brink of not wanting to live anymore.  The couple is survived by three daughters, one who which has a husband with a bad drinking problem.  The film takes a new dreadful turn when we are introduced the husband's new girlfriend.'Manhattan' in this one - which was praised by many - Woody Allen dates a 17-year old, who is madly in love with him, and he isn't sure how he feels about her.  When a new woman comes into his life (his best friend's mistress), he decides to dump the teenager to persue this other one.  Woody's character becomes discouraged when his ex-wife writes an unflattering book about their past relationship.  Like 'Annie Hall', this is another good film about couples.  My favorite line in the film has got be be:  (when told that he thinks he's God) Woody says - ""Well, I've got to model myself after somebody.""'Stardust Memories' is about Woody's character who is a flimmaker who is contimplating suicide after a career he's grown bored of.  But there might be something out there to change his mind.All in all, this box set is worth it, great laughs and some great drama.  Two other box sets are availible - one from the early to mid 80's.  The other from the late 80's, early 90's.If you're wondering why Woody's other 90's films aren't availible in a box set - it's because these three box sets (spanning from '71 to '92) are all made by the same production company (MGM, who was recently bought out by Sony).  Further films throughout the 90's were done by different companies.
