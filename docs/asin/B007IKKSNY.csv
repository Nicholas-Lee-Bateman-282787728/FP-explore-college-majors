1531392,A1RXJG34ZT3WWX,B007IKKSNY,"C. M Torres ""chator4""","[5, 8]","Of the three Marvel anime shows I've seen (X-men, Iron Man) and this one, I would have to say I liked this one the least. First, what works. The animation is great, and seeing Wolverine as a young and lean, James Dean looking, romantic idealist who thinks he's unstoppable really works for this story. Milo Ventilmiglia is great voicing the character. I also liked some of the secondary characters like Yukio, Shingen, Kikyo, Min, and Yukio's father, they were all memorable in their own way. What doesn't work: Mikyo, Wolverine's love and Shingen's daughter, who gets taken away by him to marry the sick and slimy Kurohagi, is pretty invisible for most of the series, and I had a hard time understanding why Wolverine would go to such lengths to stop her from marrying Kurohagi, risking life and limb many times over. The cameo by Cyclops is pretty lame; he basically shows up to taxi Wolverine to the island of Madripor. Really? Cyclops who has no love for Wolverine is going to use the Blackbird to taxi a testy Wolverine, no questions asked?! What also didn't work were a lot of the action scenes that just came off as incredibly unbelievable were they to take place in the real world, not the world of animation. A lot of the fight scenes were so stylized that you couldn't really tell what happened. I felt Wolverine's abilities were really exaggerated just to get him out of the impossible situations he was put into. No matter how tough an adamantium skeleton with razor sharp claws and healing factor makes you, you're not indestructible. But this point seems to have been lost in the writing/animation. The fight scenes that worked best were the ones between Shingen and Wolverine. I wanted to see this anime series as the upcoming sequel to X-men origins: Wolverine, titled ""The Wolverine,"" will deal with a similar story and both this series and the upcoming live action movie seem to rely on the same source material, Frank Miller's Wolverine graphic novel.",3,Anime Wolverine,1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,1970,"['three', 'Marvel', 'anime', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'X-men', 'Iron', 'Man', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'liked', 'one', 'least', 'First', 'what', 'animation', 'great', 'seeing', 'Wolverine', 'young', 'lean', 'James', 'Dean', 'looking', 'romantic', 'idealist', 'who', 'unstoppable', 'really', 'story', 'Milo', 'Ventilmiglia', 'great', 'voicing', 'character', 'also', 'liked', 'secondary', 'characters', 'Yukio', 'Shingen', 'Kikyo', 'Min', 'Yukio', 'father', 'were', 'memorable', 'own', 'way', 'What', ""n't"", 'work', 'Mikyo', 'Wolverine', 'love', 'Shingen', 'daughter', 'who', 'taken', 'away', 'marry', 'sick', 'slimy', 'Kurohagi', 'pretty', 'invisible', 'most', 'series', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'why', 'Wolverine', 'would', 'go', 'such', 'lengths', 'stop', 'marrying', 'Kurohagi', 'risking', 'life', 'limb', 'many', 'times', 'cameo', 'Cyclops', 'pretty', 'lame', 'basically', 'up', 'taxi', 'Wolverine', 'island', 'Madripor', 'Really', 'Cyclops', 'who', 'love', 'Wolverine', 'going', 'use', 'Blackbird', 'taxi', 'testy', 'Wolverine', 'questions', 'asked', 'What', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'were', 'lot', 'action', 'just', 'came', 'off', 'incredibly', 'unbelievable', 'were', 'take', 'place', 'real', 'world', 'not', 'world', 'animation', 'lot', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'stylized', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'what', 'happened', 'felt', 'Wolverine', 'abilities', 'were', 'really', 'exaggerated', 'just', 'get', 'impossible', 'situations', 'was', 'put', 'matter', 'how', 'tough', 'adamantium', 'skeleton', 'razor', 'sharp', 'claws', 'healing', 'factor', ""'re"", 'not', 'indestructible', 'point', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'writing/animation', 'fight', 'scenes', 'worked', 'best', 'were', 'ones', 'Shingen', 'Wolverine', 'wanted', 'see', 'anime', 'series', 'upcoming', 'sequel', 'X-men', 'origins', 'Wolverine', 'titled', 'Wolverine', 'will', 'deal', 'similar', 'story', 'series', 'upcoming', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'seem', 'rely', 'same', 'source', 'material', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Wolverine', 'graphic', 'novel']",Wolverine
1531393,A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ,B007IKKSNY,"Darth Mortis ""Dark Lord of the Sith""","[0, 0]","Marvel has dipped a bit into Anime and I decided I had to get a look for myself. Naturally, Wolverine got his own, 12 episode series. The series starts off with he and the love of his life, Mariko Yashida, on a boat together when Mariko is taken. When he finally finds her, Logan discovers she is betrothed to another, at the insistence of her father, Shingen. For those who have read the comics, events in here have some resemblance to the Wolverine limited series as well as some parts of the Wolverine regular series from years ago. We do get to see some other villains, such as Omega Red show up.I am a big time Wolverine fan. I have been for years now. I did like the series, but I have some issues with it too. There is lots of action and plenty of Logan putting bad guys into a &#34;world of hurt&#34;. We get to see some cool characters such as Yukio cause some havoc. What bothers me most, however, is how Logan is portrayed but I will explain.Prior to watching this series, I watched the Anime X-Men series (which is awesome). In that series, they did a great job with the voices and the dialogue matched very well with how the characters, including Wolverine, are portrayed in the comics (or at least how they were in the 80's and 90's, I haven't collected in about 14 years). Wolverine in this series probably has one of the worst voice overs they could have chosen. It just doesn't match with the Logan that we know (or any of the voices in other animated series he has been in). He is smaller framed and thinner in this series too. It was almost as if I couldn't see him as Wolverine until he popped his claws out.The voices in general didn't come nearly as close to the quality they found for the Anime X-Men series. I know Anime in general has some lousy voice overs anyway, to the point where it is kind of funny and that is one allure of anime. It doesn't ruin the show, but it definitely does detract. Again, part of my problem is that they did it right with X-Men so I feel as though they could have done it right here.Overall, it's a good series and it's pretty cheap here. Wolverine fans should certainly consider getting this.",4,Decent,1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,2149,"['Marvel', 'dipped', 'bit', 'Anime', 'decided', 'had', 'get', 'look', 'Naturally', 'Wolverine', 'got', 'own', '12', 'episode', 'series', 'series', 'love', 'life', 'Mariko', 'Yashida', 'boat', 'together', 'when', 'Mariko', 'taken', 'When', 'finally', 'Logan', 'betrothed', 'insistence', 'father', 'Shingen', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'comics', 'events', 'here', 'have', 'resemblance', 'Wolverine', 'limited', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'parts', 'Wolverine', 'regular', 'series', 'years', 'ago', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'other', 'villains', 'such', 'Omega', 'Red', 'show', 'am', 'big', 'time', 'Wolverine', 'fan', 'have', 'been', 'years', 'now', 'did', 'series', 'have', 'issues', 'too', 'lots', 'action', 'plenty', 'Logan', 'putting', 'bad', 'guys', '34', 'world', 'hurt', '34', 'get', 'see', 'cool', 'characters', 'such', 'Yukio', 'cause', 'havoc', 'What', 'most', 'however', 'how', 'Logan', 'portrayed', 'will', 'explain.Prior', 'watching', 'series', 'watched', 'Anime', 'X-Men', 'series', 'awesome', 'series', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'voices', 'dialogue', 'matched', 'very', 'well', 'how', 'characters', 'including', 'Wolverine', 'are', 'portrayed', 'comics', 'least', 'how', 'were', '80', '90', 'have', ""n't"", 'collected', 'about', '14', 'years', 'Wolverine', 'series', 'probably', 'one', 'worst', 'voice', 'overs', 'could', 'have', 'chosen', 'just', ""n't"", 'match', 'Logan', 'know', 'voices', 'other', 'animated', 'series', 'been', 'smaller', 'framed', 'thinner', 'series', 'too', 'was', 'almost', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'Wolverine', 'popped', 'claws', 'out.The', 'voices', 'general', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'nearly', 'as', 'close', 'quality', 'found', 'Anime', 'X-Men', 'series', 'know', 'Anime', 'general', 'lousy', 'voice', 'overs', 'anyway', 'point', 'where', 'kind', 'funny', 'one', 'allure', 'anime', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'show', 'definitely', 'detract', 'Again', 'part', 'problem', 'did', 'right', 'X-Men', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'right', 'here.Overall', 'good', 'series', 'pretty', 'cheap', 'here', 'Wolverine', 'fans', 'should', 'certainly', 'consider', 'getting']",Wolverine

I think this is also confirmed by the anti-hero's stand-alone movie and another on the way. Japanese animator's Madhouse and Marvel Entertainment bring us the superhero's very own 12-part anime TV series to DVD. It's based on Frank Miller and Chris Claremont's successful 1982 storyline as its framework.Wolverine's girlfriend, Mariko, is snatched by her father Shingen. He is the leader of a Japanese crime ring. She is promised to a man named Hideki Kurohagi for an arranged marriage. Wolverine embarks on a mission to rescue Mariko from the clutches of her father and battles several different adversaries along the way.The character of Logan and his alter ego in the ""Wolverine"" Anime Series is distinct from other depictions. He appears younger and not as rough around the edges as he's portrayed in the comic books and movies. It feels like we are taken back to see how he was in his youth. Maybe that was the intention of the animators and writers of the show.There's plenty of action and violence to keep fans of Wolverine and the X-Men satisfied. The anime style also moves things along at a breakneck speed. If you already love the character, then this series will give you something to tide you over until his next big-screen adventure in ""The Wolverine."" It may actually give you a hint at what's to come since the movie is supposed to be based on the same story arc this animated series is.Bonus material include three featurettes entitled ""The Marvel Anime Universe: Wolverine Reborn,"" ""The Ferocious Anti-Hero: Wolverine Defined,"" and ""Wolverine Meets X-Men."" The first two are around nine minutes long and delve behind-the-scenes of the series and the character. The last featurette is around 30 minutes long and spotlights the production crew of the show.The ""Wolverine"" Anime Series provides a great vision of the character in the popular Asian artistic style so many people are fans of worldwide. It gives viewers an alternate take on the character and his world than we get in the ""X-Men"" and ""Origins"" movies. 12 episodes clocking in at 284 minutes and a few featurettes will make this a worthy buy for enthusiasts and consumers.",4,"DVD Review: ""Wolverine"" Anime Series",1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,2267,"['X-Men', 'Wolverine', 'one', 'who', 'proven', 'successful', 'carrying', 'own', 'weight', 'team', 'books', 'think', 'also', 'confirmed', 'anti-hero', 'stand-alone', 'movie', 'way', 'Japanese', 'animator', 'Madhouse', 'Marvel', 'Entertainment', 'bring', 'superhero', 'very', 'own', '12-part', 'anime', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'based', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Chris', 'Claremont', 'successful', '1982', 'storyline', 'framework.Wolverine', 'girlfriend', 'Mariko', 'snatched', 'father', 'Shingen', 'leader', 'Japanese', 'crime', 'ring', 'promised', 'man', 'named', 'Hideki', 'Kurohagi', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'Wolverine', 'mission', 'rescue', 'Mariko', 'clutches', 'father', 'several', 'different', 'adversaries', 'way.The', 'character', 'Logan', 'alter', 'ego', 'Wolverine', 'Anime', 'Series', 'distinct', 'other', 'depictions', 'younger', 'not', 'rough', 'edges', 'portrayed', 'comic', 'books', 'movies', 'are', 'taken', 'back', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'youth', 'Maybe', 'was', 'intention', 'animators', 'writers', 'show.There', 'plenty', 'action', 'violence', 'keep', 'fans', 'Wolverine', 'X-Men', 'satisfied', 'anime', 'style', 'also', 'things', 'along', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'already', 'love', 'character', 'then', 'series', 'will', 'give', 'something', 'tide', 'next', 'big-screen', 'adventure', 'Wolverine', 'may', 'actually', 'give', 'hint', 'what', 'come', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'same', 'story', 'animated', 'series', 'is.Bonus', 'material', 'include', 'three', 'featurettes', 'entitled', 'Marvel', 'Anime', 'Universe', 'Wolverine', 'Reborn', 'Ferocious', 'Anti-Hero', 'Wolverine', 'Defined', 'Wolverine', 'Meets', 'X-Men', 'first', 'two', 'are', 'nine', 'minutes', 'long', 'delve', 'behind-the-scenes', 'series', 'character', 'last', 'featurette', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'spotlights', 'production', 'crew', 'show.The', 'Wolverine', 'Anime', 'Series', 'great', 'vision', 'character', 'popular', 'Asian', 'artistic', 'style', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'fans', 'worldwide', 'viewers', 'alternate', 'take', 'character', 'world', 'get', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'movies', '12', 'episodes', 'clocking', '284', 'minutes', 'few', 'featurettes', 'will', 'make', 'worthy', 'buy', 'enthusiasts', 'consumers']",Wolverine

1531403,AHF97M45JFCB,B007IKKSNY,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","To be completely honest, my first taste of western mythos combined with eastern animation practice came in the form of 2008&#8217;s Gotham Knight.  When the film(s) concluded, my own conclusion was that the practice of combing the two elements was anything but a smooth one.  It was rather interesting to witness what anime masters were able to do with the long standing DC franchise but as a whole it felt too dark, disjointed and frankly strange to warrant a repeat viewing for my taste.Enter 2010 when the practice of combining American comic material with Japanese anime would surface once again.  This time it would be Marvel properties, four of them to be exact, produced in collaboration between Marvel Entertainment and Japanese animation studio Madhouse. The four twelve-episode series were based on Iron Man, Wolverine, X-Men, and Blade respectively.As anyone who follows anything about Wolverine likely realizes, his backstory makes for perhaps the smoothest transition into anime material; after all, according to 1982&#8217;s  limited comic series Wolverine by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, we learn of a whole period of Logan&#8217;s life spent in Japan following events taking place in WWII.  It is this era that Wolverine the anime covers (it is also this era that was used in the 2013 live action film The Wolverine).To summarize the plot concisely and without spoilers, Logan learns that his true love, Mariko Yashida, who disappeared a year earlier, has been taken to Tokyo by her father Shingen Yashida, the head of the Japanese crime syndicate Kuzuryu to be wed to crime boss Hideki Kurohagi. Wolverine goes on a quest to rescue Mariko and hack, slash and otherwise dispatch a whole plethora of opponents along the way.I realize that sounds alarmingly simplistic but truly, that is the plot.  Madhouse takes its time spanning 12 twenty-two minute episodes (284-minutes total) to tell this tale in a manner that only anime could.It goes without saying that there are notable differences in philosophy between the American and Japanese approach to animation and perhaps nowhere are these differences clearer than in an instance like this; where a long standing American institution, one we have all seen animated dozens of times over throughout the years, is subjected to the full anime treatment then brought back to the US with your choice of original Japanese dialog track, English dub and the option to run subtitles beneath either.Right off the bat I have to confess that some elements work here in the format, perhaps even succeed while others fall flat.  Let&#8217;s take a look at some of these nuances in the hopes of determining whether this collection is right for you.  We&#8217;ll begin with the pacing of the piece; which can only be described as anime.  If that means nothing to you, imagine an episodic story that is serialized in the strictest sense of the term.  Episodes can (and frequently do) end on absolute cliffhangers with no hope of resolve until future episodes in the arc.  Minimal time is spent catching the viewer up on past events.  In short, this is a single tale broken up into 12 individual chapters rather than 12 separate episodes comprising a single season as is common here in the US.Furthermore anime takes a very methodical and plodding approach to its storytelling, often giving the impression that it is under no pressure whatsoever to hurry the prose along.  As such it&#8217;s not uncommon to encounter entire episodes that advance the overall plot no further than 18-minutes of a fight sequence (complete with blood and intensity).  Again, not right or wrong, just different from the western school of thought on animation.Visually the piece is all eastern; which is to say beautiful throughout.  Never mind super saturated color pallets or anything &#8220;cartoony&#8221; for that matter.  The look of the show is almost like portrait art set into motion.  Madhouse truly spared no expense in bringing its renowned artistic quality to the franchise.Exposition falls onto the &#8220;show&#8221; not &#8220;tell&#8221; side of the coin and as a result don&#8217;t expect abundant dialog here.  Many episodes contain only a handful of spoken sentences and are instead visually intensive with multiple flashbacks and points of view to consider.I have to say that about my own biggest complaint to the series stems from the fact that the titular character is portrayed in a light that long-standing fans of the material may find askew.  The bestial, short, stout and foul tempered Logan/Wolverine of comic lore is absent entirely here and in his place is a tall, lean mullet-sporting mutant.  Yes they&#8217;ve included his extra-sensitive sniffer, fangs and trademark adamantium claws, but the character is rife with the cold, quiet distantly disturbed quality that seems to be a staple among lead anime roles.  Combine this with the minimal dialog and (with the English actor especially) a delivery that sounds forcefully monotone and emotionless and you come away with a Logan who is equal parts Cloud Strife and Neo from the Matrix.All in all, despite how it may seem by my critique, I do find the process of witnessing the translation of a beloved franchise through a different philosophy of animation to be an enjoyable one.  The price is certainly affordable to warrant adding the complete anime to any collection though I don&#8217;t suppose it will be loved by any and all fans of the Wolverine/ X-Men franchise.  Going into it expecting anime that just so happens to involve Marvel characters makes it far more enjoyable than expecting Madhouse&#8217;s interpretation of say X-Men Evolution.",3,Engaging Material

What surprised me was the fact that the English language version didn't match the English captions. The characters did act in ways that were unlike their western counterparts.  However it was fun to watch Wolverine in a different environment.  There were no boring scenes! It was just battle after battle, which is what I paid to see.  While it could use some tweaking and fine tuning; I wouldn't rule out buying season two if there is one.  After watching this collection I want to purchase Iron Man, X-Men and Blade.The stories in this edition were slightly based on Frank Miller's version of Wolverine.

This anime series borrows from it but keeps it kind of new.  Omeaga Red was the only sour note his fight scenes were great, but it felt out of place in this story.  Everything else worked really good there is a really cool back story on the new characters to make you feel for them, the twist and turn reminded me of a really good video game script.There's is a couple of movie references one to the graduate when Wolverine stops the wedding and a great Rocky 3 tease after the credits of the last episode.I was surprised by how good the story really was, yes there are some fights for no reason but to have a cool fight scene but there are plenty shocking plots and sub plots, and there is a good amount of blood, I would not recommend this for little kids, there are some bloody scenes.
