First of all, the title no longer makes any sense, since he's not a burned spy anymore. Actually, he's a fugitive for most of this season. There are some really good shows, such as the one where he visits Fiona in prison, and there are some real stinkers too. Overall, the episodes are more serious with main characters getting shot, imprisoned, or even killed. Some of it you have to wonder why it was done, since it did little to advance the show. The events surrounding Nate, for example, seemed kind of pointless. Also, I found the anger scenes to be very forced when Michael tries to get Fiona out of prison.

1507094,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B0060MYLCU,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[79, 88]","Most people that love BURN NOTICE like I do, love it because it has a certain formula that's proven was working for four seasons. Breezy, smart, well-acted and fun. That was the status quo.Then Season Five came along, and things started to get shaken up a little as showrunner Matt Nix decided it was time for a new status quo. A new, decidedly more devilish villain, Anson (the fantastically wormy Jere Burns) had come along, framed Fiona for murder and set Michael up to do his dastardly bidding in order to keep Fi out of prison. Last season ended up with Fi turning herself into the authorities, putting Anson on the run, and leaving Michael alone and desperate to do whatever he had to do in order to get Fi out of prison.This particular side of Michael hadn't really been exposed before because we're not really used to seeing him this desperate to catch the bad guy, but even more so, we see his greatest vulnerability: The people he loves, and as this season proves, it's not always possible to save all of them.The season begins with Michael and the CIA, primarily represented by Agent Pearce, reprised by Lauren Stamile, in breathless pursuit of Anson and anyone or anything that might lead to his capture, and Fiona doing her best to survive in prison. As it turns out, someone on the outside wants Fiona dead and this again leads back to another seemingly ancillary character from last season, Rebecca (the formidable Kristanna Loken), and Michael, Sam and Jesse (becoming a more centralized player in this season) follow up on anything that might lead to her capture. In the midst of all of this, Michael's original training officer, Tom Card (the terrific John C. McGinley) comes back into Michael's life and so does Michael's ne'er-do-well younger brother Nate (Seth Peterson), who returns back home to Mom (Can Sharon Gless get a darn Emmy nod, just once, for her extraordinary work on this show, please?) after his marriage falls apart and looks to help Michael in whatever way he can to free Fiona.As the season goes on, things return to form for the trio on the outside and enemies become potential allies. The mad pursuit of Anson comes to a climax that ends with not one but two extremely shocking deaths and, even though one of these deaths ends up freeing Fiona, the other one wounds all of our main characters to their core, and this time, Michael, Fi, Sam and Jesse are all out for blood. When the discovery is made as to who is directly and indirectly responsible for this death, we start heading in a different direction again, as Michael does something that he knows he can never fully walk away from, and the show's direction gets darker still as CIA Agent Olivia Riley (THE WIRE's Kima Greggs herself, Sonja Sohn) vows to hunt Michael and all of his cohorts down for the crime he has committed. However, when the show threatens to get too dark, we get a bright light with the character of Calvin Schmidt (the hilariously funny and immensely likable Patton Oswalt), a master forger who can get everything they need for the team to get out of the country... but it comes at a price.Although once we get to the season finale, the audience seems to get shafted a bit, as Riley seems to turn on a dime, because there's no clear villain left for the season. It really feels inorganic as far as her character is concerned, and even worse, it feels like Nix and the other writers just plain ran out of room for this season by packing it with too many ideas and not enough time to wrap everything up. It's certainly not the season finale I was hoping for, but at least the feeling of the cliffhanger this series is known for at its finales is ambiguous enough to let us guess as to where the show will go next.Certainly, Season Six is a strange turn-around for the show, particularly since the previous season had a darker direction already going on, but this is the darkest the show has ever been, and it sets a new standard that no one, not even our leads, are safe. Rather than chalking it up to lazy writing or, as some would put it, ""jumping the shark"", Nix and crew have let the show evolve into something that is no longer as simply fun and formulaic, but rather something that allows for more serious stories to be told, as well as greater danger abounding for all of our characters.There is still much fun to be had with this show, and a lot of it is in the episodes with Oswalt, whose glib one-liners and whiny faux tough-guy attitude gives the show a lot of lightheartedness.",5,Has BURN NOTICE become too dark?

Nothing besides some VERY poorly written dialogue. Very poor dialogue. It's like listening to a high school writing class. I cringed a few times. These characters don't talk like this. Ever. No context, no set up, just stuff like - ""I was your star pupil!"" What!? Not ""I was the best"" or ""I am the best"" but ""star pupil""? Michael doesn't talk like that! NO ONE talks like that in real life. Sam isn't funny anymore. He's just a grumpy dad whose son Michael won't listen to him. At one point Michael pulls a gun on him. Sorry, but I don't see that EVER happening no matter the trouble Fiona is in. And Sam got punched in the face by a trucker without even trying to block or avoid, an angry trucker they saw coming a mile away. I'm sorry, but who ever they got writing Season 6 is doing a lousy job. There is nothing clever or creative or fun in Season 6, and cleverness and fun was what this show had going for it.

It seems a bit incongruous at first but really fits the character's development. The season rolls along quite well, darker than previously, but still it seems we may finally see the culmination of the overarching story as the series steams towards conclusion. Michael, Fi, Sam, Jesse and Maddie really seem to be blending as a ""family"". When they look to find Nate's killer and Michael eventually taking out Tom Card it's pretty predictable but the cast's chemistry carry's the story.As per usual, the real good guys in the agency get killed (Max, and Jason) or exiled (Pearce) while more bad people surface (Card and Riley). If this were Star Trek any person having information clearing Michael of wrongdoing would be wearing a red shirt. The season is great up until Riley enlists a drug cartel hit squad to go after the group. For this supposed by-the-book tough-as-nails ""legend"" in the agency to go off the reservation like that strikes an odd chord, to say the least.Needless to say, they turn the tables on Riley and should be free, but they're all loccked in cells for a few weeks for debreifing and when Fi is finally let out she sees Michael dressed in a nice suit and he's made a deal to keep them all free where he's an agency asset once again after promissing Fi he was done.

Season six starts to slump into much darker territory by allowing these loved and admired (that bit's important) characters go through the wringer like never before.  It shakes the formula up enough to make the loyal viewers not entirely trust who will be coming back and who won't for the next season, and occasionally, the next episode.I haven't seen a lick of season seven yet but six has me worried that not even our main foursome of Michael, Fiona, Sam, and Jesse will all make it out alive.

1507158,AU32WCV4GOUWT,B0060MYLCU,Timetoride,"[4, 10]","The series began as something fresh and fun.  Jeff Donovan (Michael) and Gabrielle Anwar (Fiona) were fun and charming together--and it was great to see a couple that was already in a relationship and to see them use that rather than just the basic push-pull of will they or won't they get together that is a downfall of so many other shows.The ensemble cast also includes Bruce Campbell (Sam) and Sharon Gless (Madie) rounded out and balanced the storylines.  Bruce was the comic relief and Sharon was often the straight man for both Bruce and Jeff's characters.When Jeff acted and took on different characters each week, it was fun and his accents were marvelous. He also managed to get out of tough situations by ""MacGyvering"" his way through, which added yet another dimension to the series. Gabrielle was always the dangerous sex kitten who could beat any demolition expert in any other series or movie.  It was a nice change from a hulking guy to have a smart, sexy woman in that role.Then it all went south in the 3rd season.  In the middle of the season, the focus shifted from being a group of do-gooders, to Michael single-mindedly pursuing the people who burned him.  All other attempts at the stories and characters that made us love the show disappeared.  Then they added the character of Jesse.  It unbalanced the cast.  His acting is wooden and his character unnecessary. He added nothing to the show.  In an attempt to write storylines that included his character, they moved even further away from the original premise that made us love the show.Now, it is limping along to it's (hopefully) conclusion.  With the series being signed up for five seasons, I can only hope that they find a way to bring back the spark that made it a hit.  It would be nice to have that chemistry back, to bring back the balance in the stories and get rid of the chaff that clogged up the gears.  This episode is yet another sad addition to a series that is now circling the drain.It is sad to see something so fun lose the spark so quickly.  Fiona in prison?  Ugh.  Who cares?  She's wearing jump suits and it looks like a bad take on those old female prison soaps.  Michael working on his old job and still chasing down the people who burned him without helping the little  people along the way?  Boring.  Dull.  Flat.  It seems the writers are only writing for themselves and have forgotten their audience.  Sam serious, no longer dating wealthy woman and acting more like a father figure than a wise cracking friend?  I don't want to watch that.  Madie getting more involved in Michael's cases and no longer a hypochondriac?  The fun is gone with her making Michael crazy.  And Jesse???  Just say, ""No!"" next time.
