49343,AQZKP1G8LSSR6,0783221789,Burak Kilic,"[5, 7]","'Buried Alive' is not a movie about zombies. In fact it holds a degree of realism. It's about a woman, who gets poisoned by her husband and buried in the cemetary when she's still alive. Of course, people don't know this. Her husband's motive is to get the money she received as heritage and move away with his mistress. To ensure that she doesn't get out of the graveyard, he asks that his wife is mummified twice. However, things don't work out as they should; and she's put into the coffin without being mummified at all. With a few more coincidences, she will make her way out somehow; and, it will be her revenge when she arrives home and sees her husband with his mistress.If you're seeking for a movie at nighttime with your friends, and you want it to be a little scary, 'Buried Alive 2' is not a bad choice at all. However, you have to keep in mind that the movie is not very long.",3,Coincidences Lead The Way To Death.,1055635200,"06 15, 2003",2003,890,"[""'Buried"", 'Alive', 'not', 'movie', 'zombies', 'fact', 'degree', 'realism', 'woman', 'who', 'poisoned', 'husband', 'buried', 'cemetary', 'when', 'still', 'alive', 'course', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'husband', 'motive', 'get', 'money', 'received', 'heritage', 'move', 'away', 'mistress', 'ensure', ""n't"", 'get', 'graveyard', 'wife', 'mummified', 'twice', 'However', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'should', 'put', 'coffin', 'being', 'mummified', 'few', 'more', 'coincidences', 'will', 'make', 'way', 'somehow', 'will', 'be', 'revenge', 'when', 'home', 'husband', 'mistress.If', ""'re"", 'seeking', 'movie', 'nighttime', 'friends', 'want', 'be', 'little', 'scary', ""'Buried"", 'Alive', '2', 'not', 'bad', 'choice', 'However', 'have', 'keep', 'mind', 'movie', 'not', 'very', 'long']",N/A

Woman get buried alive by her husband because he wants out of the marriage but he wouldnt get anything out of it. hes cheating on her.  he figures if his wife dies then he gets the money and so he has her buried alive saying to embalm her twice to see that shes dead which obviously doesnt happen because the movie is called &quot;buried alive&quot; and not &quot;embalmed alive&quot;.  well wifey wakes up and comes back to give her boy what he deserves.  great movie.  i woulda watched it sooner but the movie was put out to be a horror when actually its not..  its kind of a drama suspense thing.  not even much violence really..,4,Dont ya hate the cover,1055721600,"06 16, 2003",2003,701,"['look', 'horror', 'movie', 'something', 'great', 'movie', 'Woman', 'get', 'buried', 'alive', 'husband', 'marriage', 'get', 'anything', 'hes', 'cheating', 'wife', 'then', 'money', 'so', 'buried', 'alive', 'saying', 'embalm', 'twice', 'see', 'shes', 'dead', 'obviously', 'happen', 'movie', 'called', 'quot', 'buried', 'alive', 'quot', 'not', 'quot', 'embalmed', 'alive', 'quot', 'well', 'wifey', 'up', 'back', 'give', 'boy', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'i', 'woulda', 'watched', 'sooner', 'movie', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'be', 'horror', 'when', 'actually', 'not..', 'kind', 'drama', 'suspense', 'thing', 'not', 'even', 'much', 'violence', 'really..']",N/A
49345,ANP46RYUYH2BH,0783221789,Gloria J. Green,"[4, 4]","This movie is great.  I'm a big Tim Matheson fan.  To get the full impact of this movie, you should see the first one ""Buried Alive"" with Tim Matheson and Jennifer Jason Leigh.  The sequel ""Buried Alive II"" is about a man who poisons his wife to get her inheritance so he can buy a yacht and continue his affair with his mistress.  Problem is, once she is dead, he wants a quicky funeral and wants her embalmed twice.  As in the first movie, where the wife poisons husband Clint Goodman (Tim Matheson) and he is dead, (so everyone thinks) everything goes wrong at the funeral home.  The embalming machine goes berserk and there is no embalming done at all.  This is when the movies get really good. Both of them actually.  To see what the so called dead spouses do to get revenge on the spouse who poisoned them, but did not actually kill them keeps you on your toes and keeps you in suspense until the very end. As the other reviewers say, this is not a zombie movie.  The spouse thought to be dead is actually still alive, but the poison from the fish puts them in a kind of like catatonic state, where they appear dead.  This is not a horror movie, but more of a suspense, thriller, drama movie.  In any event, if you watch one, you have to watch the other.  Excellent movies.
