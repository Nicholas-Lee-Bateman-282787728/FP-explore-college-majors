955180,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000C65YMQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 4]","Vital (Shinya Tsukamoto, 2004)Shinya Tsukamoto began his career by quickly becoming, as All-Movie Guide calls him, ""the master of body horror"" with Tetsuo: The Iron Man and its sequel Bodyhammer. He got away from that relatively quickly, though, and starting in the late nineties, Tsukamoto turned his talent to deep, slow-paced psychological dramas. Vital continues on in that tradition, and when you get Shinya Tsukamoto behind the camera and Tadanobu Asano in front of it, you're pretty much guaranteed a winner.Asano (The Last Life in the Universe) plays Hiroshi Takagi, a man who, on the death of his girlfriend Ryoko, suffers a major psychotic break. When he recovers, he slowly begins to pick up the pieces of his life, including returning to medical school. Once his dissection class begins, he becomes convinced that the body on his table is that of his girlfriend. He becomes more and more obsessed with the idea, drawing her father (Kill Bill's Jun Kunimura) into his fantasies (or are they?).It's a Shinya Tsukamoto film, so you can count on it being shot dark. I mean, really dark. David Fincher dreams of making a movie with as little light in it as Shinya Tsukamoto's. Asano spends most of his time glowering, as usual, and uttering aphorisms with as little emotion as possible. If you're looking for an Asian version of Clint Eastwood, look no further, though Asano is (obviously) a touch more adventurous in his choice of roles.There's really nothing bad I can say about this movie. If you're a Tsukamoto fan, it's a must; if you haven't yet discovered the man's work, this is an excellent starting point. ****",4,Shinya Tsukamoto rules.,1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,1627,"['Vital', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', '2004', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', 'began', 'career', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'All-Movie', 'Guide', 'master', 'body', 'horror', 'Tetsuo', 'Iron', 'Man', 'sequel', 'Bodyhammer', 'got', 'away', 'relatively', 'quickly', 'starting', 'late', 'nineties', 'Tsukamoto', 'turned', 'talent', 'deep', 'slow-paced', 'psychological', 'dramas', 'Vital', 'tradition', 'when', 'get', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', 'camera', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', 'front', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'guaranteed', 'winner.Asano', 'Last', 'Life', 'Universe', 'Hiroshi', 'Takagi', 'man', 'who', 'death', 'girlfriend', 'Ryoko', 'major', 'psychotic', 'break', 'When', 'slowly', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'life', 'including', 'returning', 'medical', 'school', 'dissection', 'class', 'convinced', 'body', 'table', 'girlfriend', 'more', 'more', 'obsessed', 'idea', 'drawing', 'father', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Jun', 'Kunimura', 'fantasies', 'are', '.It', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', 'film', 'can', 'count', 'being', 'shot', 'dark', 'mean', 'really', 'dark', 'David', 'Fincher', 'dreams', 'making', 'movie', 'as', 'little', 'light', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', 'Asano', 'most', 'time', 'glowering', 'usual', 'uttering', 'aphorisms', 'as', 'little', 'emotion', 'possible', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Asian', 'version', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'look', 'further', 'Asano', 'obviously', 'touch', 'more', 'adventurous', 'choice', 'roles.There', 'really', 'nothing', 'bad', 'can', 'say', 'movie', ""'re"", 'Tsukamoto', 'fan', 'must', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'discovered', 'man', 'work', 'excellent', 'starting', 'point', '****']",Vital
955181,A145B8OHVNNFAJ,B000C65YMQ,Steward Willons,"[5, 6]","If ""Vital"" fails to find an audience, we can put the blame squarely on its marketing. When a film that can only be described as serene and introspective gets released by Tartan as part of their ""Asia Extreme"" series, you have to wonder what happened. I'm somewhat familiar with Shinya Tsukamoto and I've watched many of the Asian horror and suspense films that have made it to the USA over the last few years. Naturally, I was expecting something bizarre and freakish. I was about as wrong as I could possibly be.""Vital"" is a deliberately paced drama where the protagonist struggles to regain memories that he lost as the result of a car accident. He is, in essence, living in a state of suspended animation, unsure of the world around him. Needless to say, there isn't a lot of action or dialogue, not that one would expect it. The soundtrack is particularly effective in communicating the emotions and mental state that the protagonist is unable to articulate. The film lulls the viewer into a trance state, thus absorbing us into a story that isn't actually that original.My main criticism of the film is that I felt Tsukamoto's talent was squandered. ""Vital"" is a very straight-forward retelling of an already familiar tale. What exactly is new here? Why don't we just watch Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" again? Although the film displays beautiful craftsmanship, I don't feel that it successfully distinguishes itself from the array of similar movies, even within the realm of contemporary Asian cinema.There are touches of Tsukamoto's unique cinematic approach. There is an absolutely amazing scene that opens the film where a row of four smokestacks shift  in and out of focus, while the soundtrack presents a cacophony of aural terror. It's quite effective, although I never understood how it was connected to anything in the film. And, as I said, the soundtrack really pulls the film together and almost warrants a recommendation on its strength alone.Overall, I can give ""Vital"" a limited recommendation to fans of this highly stylized contemporary Asian cinema, and to fans of slow, peaceful dramas. In that capacity, I did enjoy ""Vital"" quite a lot. However, there will be other viewers who can safely skip this title without  too much regret. I suspect ""Vital"" will effect some viewers in a very personal and moving way (as certain other reviewers attest), but there will be other viewers who find the film tedious and lethargic.I've done my best to give a sense of the tone of the film, without saying too much. My advice is to watch it if what I've described seems interesting. And again, let me emphasize that this is most definitely *not* a horror film, nor is it ""extreme"" in any manner. As long as you don't pay much attention to the marketing and you go in with the correct expectations, you're safe.",4,"3.5 Stars - subtle and moving, but not a masterpiece",1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,2812,"['Vital', 'find', 'audience', 'can', 'put', 'blame', 'squarely', 'marketing', 'When', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'serene', 'introspective', 'released', 'Tartan', 'part', 'Asia', 'Extreme', 'series', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', ""'m"", 'somewhat', 'familiar', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'many', 'Asian', 'horror', 'suspense', 'films', 'have', 'made', 'USA', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Naturally', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'bizarre', 'freakish', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'wrong', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'Vital', 'deliberately', 'paced', 'drama', 'where', 'protagonist', 'regain', 'memories', 'lost', 'result', 'car', 'accident', 'essence', 'living', 'state', 'suspended', 'animation', 'unsure', 'world', 'Needless', 'say', ""n't"", 'lot', 'action', 'dialogue', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'soundtrack', 'particularly', 'effective', 'communicating', 'emotions', 'mental', 'state', 'protagonist', 'unable', 'articulate', 'film', 'viewer', 'trance', 'state', 'thus', 'absorbing', 'story', ""n't"", 'actually', 'original.My', 'main', 'criticism', 'film', 'felt', 'Tsukamoto', 'talent', 'was', 'squandered', 'Vital', 'very', 'straight-forward', 'retelling', 'already', 'familiar', 'tale', 'What', 'exactly', 'new', 'here', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'watch', 'Hitchcock', 'Vertigo', 'again', 'film', 'displays', 'beautiful', 'craftsmanship', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'successfully', 'array', 'similar', 'movies', 'even', 'realm', 'contemporary', 'Asian', 'cinema.There', 'are', 'touches', 'Tsukamoto', 'unique', 'cinematic', 'approach', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'row', 'four', 'smokestacks', 'shift', 'focus', 'soundtrack', 'cacophony', 'aural', 'terror', 'quite', 'effective', 'never', 'understood', 'how', 'was', 'connected', 'anything', 'film', 'said', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'film', 'together', 'almost', 'warrants', 'recommendation', 'strength', 'alone.Overall', 'can', 'give', 'Vital', 'limited', 'recommendation', 'fans', 'highly', 'stylized', 'contemporary', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'fans', 'slow', 'peaceful', 'dramas', 'capacity', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Vital', 'quite', 'lot', 'However', 'will', 'be', 'other', 'viewers', 'who', 'can', 'safely', 'skip', 'title', 'too', 'much', 'regret', 'suspect', 'Vital', 'will', 'effect', 'viewers', 'very', 'personal', 'moving', 'way', 'certain', 'other', 'reviewers', 'attest', 'will', 'be', 'other', 'viewers', 'who', 'find', 'film', 'tedious', 'lethargic.I', ""'ve"", 'done', 'best', 'give', 'sense', 'tone', 'film', 'saying', 'too', 'much', 'advice', 'watch', 'what', ""'ve"", 'described', 'interesting', 'again', 'let', 'emphasize', 'most', 'definitely', '*not*', 'horror', 'film', 'extreme', 'manner', 'As', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'marketing', 'go', 'correct', 'expectations', ""'re"", 'safe']",Vital
955182,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B000C65YMQ,Zack Davisson,"[3, 4]","""Vital"" is not an easy film to enjoy.  The pace is decidedly slow. The story is dense and obfuscated. The subject matter is bleak.  A good question to ask yourself before viewing it is, can you find a love story in an autopsy?But then, director Shinya Tsukamoto is not known for his films being easy to enjoy.  ""Tetsuo, The Iron Man"" and ""A Snake in June"" are probably his two best know films in the West, and they are far more Art House than entertainment.  While ""Vital"" is much more mainstream than either of those, it still retains his specific touch and is a challenging work. It is not going to be for everyone.In the story, Hiroshi (played by Tadanobu Asano, best known as the masochistic murderer Kakihara in ""Ichi the Killer"") is recovering from a car accident which robbed him of his memory.  While battling with splinters of memory that burst randomly into his present, he works his way through medical school, dissecting corpses as part of his training.  It soon becomes clear that the corpse he is practicing on is the dead body of his former love who died in the same car crash that cost him his memory.""Vital"" is hardly a love story, nor a horror story, nor even a psychological drama. It is a film that is impossible to categorize, other than by saying it is a Tsukamoto movie. I enjoyed it, but the people I watched it with did not.  The pacing and subtlety are almost Ozu-esque, and can require more patience than many people are willing to give to a modern film.
