967225,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000E36TDK,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[7, 8]","This intriguing collection of dances and imagery will delight anyone who likes to feast on beauty and wonder at the great mystery in dance of controlled flexibility, when a dancer has such impeccable technique that the most difficult movement is made to look easy, as in the slow melting choreography in Asharah's exquisite ""Exiled,"" the fascintaing dancing of Ariellah, who sometimes seems not to possess bones in her liquid arms, the stunning mastery of Neon's isolations, and Tempest's sumptuous ""Homage to Theda."" There are many other gorgeous dances in this DVD, among them Ya Meena and Raven's ""Shawaza,"" where they are so well coordinated that even the folds of their jewel toned blue and red costumes have a synchronized flow, and the teaming of Ariellah and Tempest in ""Ritual Means."" There is hardly a moment in ""Gothic Bellydance"" that is not visually rewarding, and though Jehan's ""Goddessence"" is my least favorite because of its theme and its minimum dance content, Jehan is a bellydance diva, not only as a dancer who is always interesting to watch, but also as musician, and some of the lovely pieces heard on this DVD are her compositions.The production is superb, with outstanding camera work and lighting, and most of all, incredibly skillful editing, which keeps one's eye interested, but never overpowers or interferes with the dance itself. The costumes are glorious, and some with such richness and texture they look like butterfly wings or the imaginary wardrobe of Scheherazade; the fabulous ""wings"" in Ayshe's ""Kali/Isis"" are breathtaking. One has the option of seeing entire program of 20 dances in sequence under the ""Enter"" tab, or by performer in alphabetical order under the ""Visions"" tab, which includes a biography and other material on the artists.

I ripped it open and slid it into my player. And...I'm afraid I quite love it!The Gothic community and the bellydance community both seem to have a lot to say about it because it doesn't seem to fit in purely enough into either of their realms. But I'm not sure it's meant for them in the first place. As a bellydance-novice and an unlikely-Goth, I find it quite a visual treat. The DVD has a whole compilation of rich performances--though all of them aren't born equal, even to the untrained eye. I quickly developed my favourites and unfavorites. All the same there's a lot to look at and a considerable amount of content for relatively little money. There's an incredible snaky sort of dance and another amazing dagger dance. If there are a few performances that don't quite cut it, the rest are skilful and powerful enough to make up for it. I watch the DVD often (mostly spellbound) and find there's a lot of things I'd love to try out and bring into my own dancing. I even think that dancers could learn something from it, if only to let go a little and experiment and explore.Not for everyone? Now there's an angle that's been discussed thoroughly. Actually, not many things are for everyone. If you're a Goth (whatever that really is), you'll likely think this isn't quite Gothic. If you're a long-time bellydance performer, you'll wonder where all the ""real"" bellydance went. But if, like me, you're just exploring dance, it's both fantastic and fantastical.Also discussed to death is the inclusion of a music video like performance with more domination scenes in it than dancing. There, I don't blame anyone for wondering. Without making any judgements on this domination business and whether it qualifies as something dance-worthy, I can certainly say it doesn't seem to fit here. It's what my mother would call ""a bit much"", if I were to show it to her, which I will not make the mistake of doing. In fact, I agree with other dancers when they say it had better not be handed over to teens.These performances are sort of theatrical and use a lot of visual effects--not the usual stage variety. They're not your average pretty-pretty either.

Durrill ""occasional dancer""","[20, 26]","I was thrilled to see a style of dance that I don't have access to made available to me via DVD and went ahead and gave it a go.While I admire all of the performers for getting in front of the camera, which takes a lot of courage for some, I couldn't help noticing that the worse the dancer, the more special effects I was bombarded with. The best dancers performed on a bare stage with a plain backdrop so that all you could focus on was them - there was no need to disguise their lack of technical skill with computer generated overlays of CHEESY headstones, iron crosses, and gothic cathedral windows, peat bogs, or swamps (Give me a break!). Other performers projected the attitude of ""Ooooh, look at me, I can do figure eights and I'm wearing a black corset!"" (So what. Take off the corset, put on a choli and attend a few dance workshops and then show me what you can do.)Overall I came out feeling like I'd witnessed a Jr. High talent show where the ""popular"" girl and her synchphants got up and flopped and swished their way through a choreography to the latest Black Eyed Peas song that they threw together the night before over pizza and M&Ms; with everyone applauding when the music stopped because it was the nice thing to do.

967232,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,B000E36TDK,Cowboy Buddha,"[63, 71]","Gothic and Bellydance are perhaps not the most obvious combination in the world but this DVD demonstrates that it can be a very intriguing and entertaining mixture. Although it is hardly purely gothic and the choreography has lots of influences way beyond traditional bellydance. The costumes and makeup were certainly stunning. Not all the music was to my taste (but I'm merely showing my age here) but it did suit the atmosphere and the performances.The presentation of the DVD itself cetainly will provoke mixed reactions. From the main menu, I made the mistake of going straight into ""Play"" which produced the 85 minute series of dances with absolutely no information about who was dancing or what the dance was supposed to be about. For that, you need to go into ""Visions"" where you will find all you need to know about the performers. But, considering all the artsy overlays used during the dances, a quick caption before each one wouldn't have hurt.At first, I thought the artsy approach to the visual style might detract from the actual dancing but the camerawork generally served the choreography rather than the other way around, with a minimum of abrupt cuts and the dancer almost always being framed in full figure. Even so, some of the imagery seemed excessive although it was probably included to reinforce the gothic theme. But flashing song lyrics on the screen was definitely unnecessary.As for the performances themselves, as can be expected with such a mixed program, there were highs and lows. My favorite dancers were Ariellah, Ayshe, Tanna and Tempest. They seemed to capure the intended mood perfectly. But Jehan's performance seemed more like a Madonna video than bellydance and Neon kept reminding me of Sandahl Bergman in Conan the Barbarian (that's not necessarily a bad thing). Compared to the other dancers, the duets by Raven & Ya Meena were rather uninspiring and repetitive.Overall, I found the performances quite intriguing while my wife seemed to love nearly every minute. It would be interesting to see these dancers in front of an audience where that interaction might produce a bit more sparkle and spontaneity. I know the emphasis on these performances is supposed to be gothic, but it would have been nice if the dancers could occasionally crack a smile just to indicate that they were really enjoying what they were doing.",4,Very Interesting....!,1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,2362,"['Gothic', 'Bellydance', 'are', 'perhaps', 'not', 'most', 'obvious', 'combination', 'world', 'DVD', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'intriguing', 'entertaining', 'mixture', 'hardly', 'purely', 'gothic', 'choreography', 'lots', 'influences', 'way', 'traditional', 'bellydance', 'costumes', 'makeup', 'were', 'certainly', 'stunning', 'Not', 'music', 'was', 'taste', ""'m"", 'merely', 'showing', 'age', 'here', 'did', 'suit', 'atmosphere', 'performances.The', 'presentation', 'DVD', 'cetainly', 'will', 'provoke', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'main', 'menu', 'made', 'mistake', 'going', 'straight', 'Play', 'produced', '85', 'minute', 'series', 'dances', 'absolutely', 'information', 'who', 'was', 'dancing', 'what', 'dance', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'about', 'need', 'go', 'Visions', 'where', 'will', 'find', 'need', 'know', 'performers', 'considering', 'artsy', 'overlays', 'used', 'dances', 'quick', 'caption', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'hurt.At', 'first', 'thought', 'artsy', 'approach', 'visual', 'style', 'might', 'detract', 'actual', 'dancing', 'camerawork', 'generally', 'served', 'choreography', 'rather', 'other', 'way', 'minimum', 'abrupt', 'cuts', 'dancer', 'almost', 'always', 'being', 'framed', 'full', 'figure', 'Even', 'so', 'imagery', 'seemed', 'excessive', 'was', 'probably', 'included', 'reinforce', 'gothic', 'theme', 'flashing', 'song', 'lyrics', 'screen', 'was', 'definitely', 'unnecessary.As', 'performances', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'mixed', 'program', 'were', 'highs', 'lows', 'favorite', 'dancers', 'were', 'Ariellah', 'Ayshe', 'Tanna', 'Tempest', 'seemed', 'capure', 'intended', 'mood', 'perfectly', 'Jehan', 'performance', 'seemed', 'more', 'Madonna', 'video', 'bellydance', 'Neon', 'kept', 'reminding', 'Sandahl', 'Bergman', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Compared', 'other', 'dancers', 'duets', 'Raven', 'Ya', 'Meena', 'were', 'rather', 'uninspiring', 'repetitive.Overall', 'found', 'performances', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'wife', 'seemed', 'love', 'nearly', 'minute', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'dancers', 'front', 'audience', 'where', 'interaction', 'might', 'produce', 'bit', 'more', 'sparkle', 'spontaneity', 'know', 'emphasis', 'performances', 'supposed', 'be', 'gothic', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'dancers', 'could', 'occasionally', 'crack', 'smile', 'just', 'indicate', 'were', 'really', 'enjoying', 'what', 'were', 'doing']",Gothic Bellydance

But after watching it again, I realized I liked it better (I do agree with the reviewer below me in that it does grow on you). I do not consider all of the performances goth. Martiya Possesion are more tribal than anything(at least on this video) and I really dislike the expression, or lack thereof, on their faces while they are dancing. They either look completely bored, pissed off, or smug. I skip right over it.I also did not care for Asharah's dance to the drum solo by Solace (""Opaque""). The dance mood does not match the mood of the music at all. The music is saying ""fast, big, upbeat"" and she's doing taxim moves and small quick moves.And of course, we all love the S&M; piece...excuse me, S&M; is NOT part of the Goth subculture, and has no place on a bellydance video. Jehan may be a great and accomplished dancer, but she didn't dance much on this and I didn't want to see what WAS on her part.Another thing I would have liked to see is more GOTH music.

An expose of gothic bellydance sounded perfect. Sadly, in 'Gothic Bellydance', the talent just isn't here, save for the exceptional Ariellah. Ariellah performs 4 times, including in a duet, which I enjoyed very much. Other than Ariellah's, I found every single performance here to be so amateurish and unskilfully dramatic (those cheap knives, the cage, the cat eyes), that I could only laugh. I'm not afraid of the utter darkness of gothic performance art, and in more capable hands the intensity and drama could have been virtues, but not when the bellydancing itself is so technically sloppy.

Most of the time the dancers were so shadowed, you couldn't see the dance and the ones that were well lit were... well... whorish.  The result is poor quality video (not headache causing color streaks or pixilation, just underlit) of dancers who just forgot their blush before they went on stage.There were a few well done, elaborate costumes (although they didn't seem all that 'goth'), but most of the girls wore obvious bras (not even well decorated ones) and skirt/coin belt variations.  There was a random girl in a sheet playing with a domme and another in a very stiff '80's cocktail dress and maryjanes... both of these costumes confused me.For some reason, there are lyrics printed on the screen during some of the dances (I think they are the ones refered to as 'underfunded music videos' in another review).  I found that and the cheep 'special effects' (photoshopping in sets and fading from one angle to another) distracting rather than artsy.I like the falls (hair, not dance) on the duets.  The dagger dance was nice.  There are smooth 'wings' that I might adapt to my own work.  Drum solos and isolation work was phenominal (when you could see it).Like other reviewers, I am not sure what to make of the light S&M.;  I'm generally a fan of the darker nature of human sexuality, but I don't think it belongs here.",3,"why ""Gothic""?",1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,1521,"['When', 'think', 'Gothic', 'think', 'elaborate', 'costumes', 'lace', 'corseting', 'triangle', 'bell', 'sleeves', 'full', 'skirts', 'layers', 'pettycoats', 'gorgeous', 'dark.This', 'DVD', 'conveyed', 'gothic', 'lighting', 'Most', 'time', 'dancers', 'were', 'so', 'shadowed', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'dance', 'ones', 'were', 'well', 'lit', 'were', 'well', 'whorish', 'result', 'poor', 'quality', 'video', 'not', 'headache', 'causing', 'color', 'streaks', 'pixilation', 'just', 'underlit', 'dancers', 'who', 'just', 'forgot', 'blush', 'went', 'stage.There', 'were', 'few', 'well', 'done', 'elaborate', 'costumes', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', ""'goth"", 'most', 'girls', 'wore', 'obvious', 'bras', 'not', 'even', 'well', 'decorated', 'ones', 'belt', 'variations', 'was', 'random', 'girl', 'sheet', 'playing', 'domme', 'very', 'stiff', ""'80"", 'cocktail', 'dress', 'maryjanes', 'costumes', 'confused', 'reason', 'are', 'lyrics', 'printed', 'screen', 'dances', 'think', 'are', 'ones', 'refered', ""'underfunded"", 'music', 'videos', 'review', 'found', 'cheep', ""'special"", 'effects', 'photoshopping', 'sets', 'fading', 'one', 'angle', 'distracting', 'rather', 'artsy.I', 'falls', 'hair', 'not', 'dance', 'duets', 'dagger', 'dance', 'was', 'nice', 'are', 'smooth', ""'wings"", 'might', 'adapt', 'own', 'work', 'Drum', 'solos', 'isolation', 'work', 'was', 'phenominal', 'when', 'could', 'see', 'other', 'reviewers', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'light', 'S', 'M', ""'m"", 'generally', 'fan', 'darker', 'nature', 'human', 'sexuality', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'here']",Gothic Bellydance

She had not watched it and I was over her house, so we popped it into theDVD player and watched it together.There is only one dancer on this DVD who seems to have any bellydance training at all - Tanna.She is stiff and not very sultry, but her veil work is VERY good and obviously authentic. Her costumeis okay. At least she is in the ""bellydance"" catagory.There is an interesting dedication to Isis on here (the Goddess, not the famous dancerfrom Dallas), but it looks more like a temple ritual than a bellydance.Other than those two, the rest was horrible. There were women dancing with what looked likekitchen steak knives, motioning slitting their own throats. Meanwhile, they were NOTbellydancing or anything like bellydancing.Most of the DVD featured women who were doing stuff that was NOT bellydance.
