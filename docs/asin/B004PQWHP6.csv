However if you make it to the end the overall story is kind of nice. I don't regret seeing it. So I kindly give it two stars.I feel that with better directing the story could have been much more exciting where as it is now it is not gripping at all. The ""bad guys"" are played by some very mild manner charterers who come off so no threatening its ridiculous. The music itself is not bad it is just not fitting. Instead of the music being written for each scene a snippet of an existing known score is inserted. So the movie has no overall musical theme. Just giving this movie its own musical score would drastically change the atmosphere and carry it through.If you're looking for a different kind of western with a strong moral message then I recommendThe Big Country [Blu-ray]",2,Poor choice of music,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,889,"['short', 'movie', 'off', 'slow', 'first', 'hour', 'more', 'acting', 'weak', 'feels', 'amateurish', 'However', 'make', 'end', 'overall', 'story', 'kind', 'nice', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'seeing', 'So', 'kindly', 'give', 'two', 'stars.I', 'feel', 'better', 'directing', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'exciting', 'where', 'now', 'not', 'gripping', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'played', 'very', 'mild', 'manner', 'charterers', 'who', 'come', 'off', 'so', 'no', 'threatening', 'ridiculous', 'music', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'fitting', 'Instead', 'music', 'being', 'written', 'scene', 'snippet', 'existing', 'known', 'score', 'inserted', 'movie', 'overall', 'musical', 'theme', 'Just', 'giving', 'movie', 'own', 'musical', 'score', 'would', 'drastically', 'change', 'atmosphere', 'carry', ""'re"", 'looking', 'different', 'kind', 'western', 'strong', 'moral', 'message', 'then', 'recommendThe', 'Big', 'Country', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']']",N/A

Schmidt ""MIKEY""","[27, 28]","Hats off to Alan Autry , David Hart and their crew for filming one of the finest westerns that I have seen in a very long time. This movie is very authentic, you get a chance to feel and see how people lived out west in the post Civil War era. The cinematography is excellent, with wonderful lighting. Forgiven was edited fantastic, it flows nicely at a very good pace. Most of the music is original, creative and was recorded very well. The acting is superb, well above average including some of Alan and David's finest acting to date. At a time when Hollywood is producing so many filthy dirty movies, we need more movies like Forgiven. I admired how Autry presents biblical Christian truths without being too preachy. This Southern Baptist minister / reviewer puts his stamp of approval on Forgiven for the entire family, except for perhaps children under six. I am looking forward to seeing more of Autry's productions in the future.

My husband loves any kind of western there is--it is about the only thing he will watch-and actually stay awake for.  He said the movie was ""OK"".  To sum up his thoughts -the movie was kind of slow moving and one fight scene-seemed a little too staged.The main problem we both had was -the name does not seem to fit the movie--dont really know what or who is forgiven and why.  The christian aspect of it was NILL--unless hearing God in the wind--was supposed to be the christian part of the movie. The alcohol in the movie did not bother us (not that we believe in drinking) but to portray that time period and to make the movie a tad more believable- YES the alcohol had to be in there!!
