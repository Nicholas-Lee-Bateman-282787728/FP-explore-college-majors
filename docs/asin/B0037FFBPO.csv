This arc was one of my favorites because it marked the return of the Green Goblin.  I loved this incarnation of the character.  But I was oh so sorry to see this series end so quickly.  Only to be replaced by a more kid-friendly Ultimate Spider-man.  Who knows?  This Spider-man junky may give Ultimate another chance some day soon if there's no more Spidy stuff to watch, aside from the upcoming 2012 Amazing Spider-man film.  Since I'm totally blind, these TV shows serve as my comic books.  So I'll take all I can get.Disney is doing a fabulous job with their Avengers series.  And Wolverine and the X-men was a thrill.  So was this series.Spectacular was just as good as the 90s Spider-man series I watched when I was a kid.  The story arcs were some of the best on TV.  The voice talents in this show gave it their all and did a remarkable job.  So did the writers.  So please check this show out if you have the cash.  But start with the complete first season.  Season 2 is comprised of volumes 5-8.  So if you're new to the world of Spider-man, give this series a chance.  Having said that, maybe I'll try watching more of Ultimate Spider-man after all.",5,"Farewell, Spider-man",1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,1316,"['final', 'volume', 'Spectacular', 'Spider-man', 'final', '3', 'episodes', 'second', 'final', 'season', 'Lots', 'finals', 'previous', 'sentence', 'eh', 'arc', 'was', 'one', 'favorites', 'marked', 'return', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'loved', 'incarnation', 'character', 'was', 'oh', 'so', 'sorry', 'see', 'series', 'end', 'so', 'quickly', 'Only', 'be', 'replaced', 'more', 'kid-friendly', 'Ultimate', 'Spider-man', 'Who', 'Spider-man', 'junky', 'may', 'give', 'Ultimate', 'chance', 'day', 'soon', 'more', 'Spidy', 'stuff', 'watch', 'aside', 'upcoming', '2012', 'Amazing', 'Spider-man', 'film', ""'m"", 'totally', 'blind', 'TV', 'shows', 'serve', 'comic', 'books', 'So', ""'ll"", 'take', 'can', 'get.Disney', 'doing', 'fabulous', 'job', 'Avengers', 'series', 'Wolverine', 'X-men', 'was', 'thrill', 'So', 'was', 'series.Spectacular', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', '90s', 'Spider-man', 'series', 'watched', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'story', 'arcs', 'were', 'best', 'TV', 'voice', 'talents', 'show', 'gave', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job', 'So', 'did', 'writers', 'So', 'please', 'check', 'show', 'out', 'have', 'cash', 'start', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'Season', '2', 'comprised', 'volumes', '5-8', 'So', ""'re"", 'new', 'world', 'Spider-man', 'give', 'series', 'chance', 'Having', 'said', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'try', 'watching', 'more', 'Ultimate', 'Spider-man']",N/A

The ep's included in this volume are on another level from just about any other animated show out there. I really liked the 90's Spiderman cartoon, but the ending of the Spectacular Spiderman series (contained in vol. 8) puts it well ahead of the earlier incarnation. The phrase ""Do yourself a favor"" is so over-used on these reviews, but this time its warranted. Do yourself a favor and check this out.
