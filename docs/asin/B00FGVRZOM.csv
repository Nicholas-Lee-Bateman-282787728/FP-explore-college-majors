1671599,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00FGVRZOM,Andrew Ellington,"[11, 13]","Sometimes those little films you didn&#8217;t see coming will actually come out of nowhere and blindside you, take you by surprise by taking for a ride you don&#8217;t want to come down from.  &#8216;Short Term 12&#8217; was that kind of film for me.  I didn&#8217;t believe it had the power to do what it did, and I didn&#8217;t feel like I would fall for it as hard as I did.  The premise felt very clich&eacute;, a little too clich&eacute; for my own taste.  I expected this to be something forced, something manipulative and even worse, something derivative of something else.Been there done that; now go home and write something else.Still, the raves kept coming.  The film that Oscar wouldn&#8217;t even dream of touching (I mean, the studio didn&#8217;t even send out screeners, which after all the Top Ten mentions would have made sense to do) was getting a lot of outside attention, and the year was turning into the &#8216;did you see that new girl Brie Larson in that phenomenal little indie film&#8217;, and soon I was feeling like a complete outcast because I HAD NOT seen &#8216;Short Term 12&#8217; yet.  I am always late to these kinds of parties though.  I have three kids, a wife, a full time job and a shortage of babysitters and so I rarely get out to the movies, and when I do it is usually to a cartoon of some sort, or an event of sorts (I did manage to see &#8216;Gravity&#8217; opening night).  The chances of me seeing &#8216;Short Term 12&#8217; before it was released on DVD was very slim.But, DVD is here, and I have officially seen, fallen and championed this film.&#8216;Short Term 12&#8217; tells the story of a troubled young woman who works at a foster care facility for other troubled young kids.  Grace is young and in love, but she is hiding a past that is corroding her identity, making it hard for her to connect wholly with others and even harder for her to hold fast to her future.  Her boyfriend Mason is patient, and with some personal news drawing them closer together, he is willing (and ready) to pursue a richer future together, but trouble starts to brew when Grace finds herself tangled in the personal life of the new girl, fourteen year-old Jayden who hates her name, hates her father and draws disturbing cartoons that tell a darker backstory than Grace was ready for.  At the same time, &#8216;Short Term 12&#8217; also shades in the story of Marcus, a long term resident turning eighteen and on the verge of release.  His fears about leaving and his plight to remain safe is heartbreaking and adds even more depth to this already insightful story.Where many films have tried and failed, &#8216;Short Term 12&#8217; succeeds because it knows how to balance out every layer here.  The film never feels muddled despite having so many characters to develop, and each one feels wholly developed, even those with limited screen time.  These actors are given such &#8216;moments&#8217; here as well, scenes that allow them to really get into the souls of these characters and make them come to life for  the audience.  Between Stanfield&#8217;s heartbreaking rap, &#8216;So You Know What It&#8217;s Like&#8217;, to Dever&#8217;s telling her story of the octopus (I cried so hard) to Larson&#8217;s savage attack of a certain person&#8217;s vehicle; &#8216;Short Term 12&#8217; is not short of shocking moments of emotional connection.And boy does this ensemble sing.Larson has received the bulk of the praise, sure, but I honestly am struggling to understand why Kaitlyn Dever didn&#8217;t get an Oscar campaign.  The pain, passion, energy and commanding honesty that comes through in her portrayal of Jayden is electrifying.  She completely owns every scene and makes them all feel so genuine, even when she&#8217;s having such outlandish and theatrical meltdowns.  You know this girl, you&#8217;ve been this girl and you want to heal this girl.Destin Cretton does such a marvelous job of crafting this film to be something so special, so human and heartfelt.  This is a perfect movie; a movie that comes into its own and leaves us with a snapshot in the lives of these young people growing taking care of young people, all the while trying to do the best they can when all the odds are stacked against them.",5,This one certainly does NOT come up short&#8230;,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,4256,"['Sometimes', 'little', 'films', 'didn', '8217', 'see', 'coming', 'will', 'actually', 'come', 'nowhere', 'blindside', 'take', 'surprise', 'taking', 'ride', 'don', '8217', 'want', 'come', 'down', '8216', 'Short', 'Term', '12', '8217', 'was', 'kind', 'film', 'didn', '8217', 'believe', 'had', 'power', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'didn', '8217', 'feel', 'would', 'fall', 'as', 'hard', 'did', 'premise', 'felt', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'little', 'too', 'clich', 'eacute', 'own', 'taste', 'expected', 'be', 'something', 'forced', 'something', 'manipulative', 'even', 'worse', 'something', 'derivative', 'something', 'else.Been', 'there', 'done', 'now', 'go', 'home', 'write', 'something', 'else.Still', 'raves', 'kept', 'coming', 'film', 'Oscar', 'wouldn', '8217', 'even', 'dream', 'touching', 'mean', 'studio', 'didn', '8217', 'even', 'send', 'out', 'screeners', 'Top', 'Ten', 'mentions', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sense', 'do', 'was', 'getting', 'lot', 'outside', 'attention', 'year', 'was', 'turning', '8216', 'did', 'see', 'new', 'girl', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'phenomenal', 'little', 'indie', 'film', '8217', 'soon', 'was', 'feeling', 'complete', 'outcast', 'HAD', 'NOT', 'seen', '8216', 'Short', 'Term', '12', '8217', 'yet', 'am', 'always', 'late', 'kinds', 'parties', 'have', 'three', 'kids', 'wife', 'full', 'time', 'job', 'shortage', 'babysitters', 'so', 'rarely', 'get', 'out', 'movies', 'when', 'do', 'usually', 'cartoon', 'sort', 'event', 'sorts', 'did', 'manage', 'see', '8216', 'Gravity', '8217', 'opening', 'night', 'chances', 'seeing', '8216', 'Short', 'Term', '12', '8217', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', 'very', 'slim.But', 'DVD', 'here', 'have', 'officially', 'seen', 'fallen', 'championed', 'film.', '8216', 'Short', 'Term', '12', '8217', 'story', 'troubled', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'foster', 'care', 'facility', 'other', 'troubled', 'young', 'kids', 'Grace', 'young', 'love', 'hiding', 'past', 'corroding', 'identity', 'making', 'hard', 'connect', 'wholly', 'others', 'even', 'harder', 'hold', 'fast', 'future', 'boyfriend', 'Mason', 'patient', 'personal', 'news', 'drawing', 'closer', 'together', 'willing', 'ready', 'pursue', 'richer', 'future', 'together', 'trouble', 'starts', 'brew', 'when', 'Grace', 'tangled', 'personal', 'life', 'new', 'girl', 'fourteen', 'year-old', 'Jayden', 'who', 'name', 'father', 'disturbing', 'cartoons', 'tell', 'darker', 'backstory', 'Grace', 'was', 'ready', 'same', 'time', '8216', 'Short', 'Term', '12', '8217', 'also', 'story', 'Marcus', 'long', 'term', 'resident', 'turning', 'eighteen', 'verge', 'release', 'fears', 'leaving', 'plight', 'remain', 'safe', 'heartbreaking', 'even', 'more', 'depth', 'already', 'insightful', 'story.Where', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'tried', 'failed', '8216', 'Short', 'Term', '12', '8217', 'how', 'balance', 'out', 'layer', 'here', 'film', 'never', 'muddled', 'having', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'develop', 'one', 'feels', 'wholly', 'developed', 'even', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'actors', 'are', 'given', 'such', '8216', 'moments', '8217', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'allow', 'really', 'get', 'souls', 'characters', 'make', 'come', 'life', 'audience', 'Between', 'Stanfield', '8217', 'heartbreaking', 'rap', '8216', 'Know', 'What', '8217', '8217', 'Dever', '8217', 's', 'telling', 'story', 'octopus', 'cried', 'so', 'hard', 'Larson', '8217', 's', 'savage', 'attack', 'certain', 'person', '8217', 's', 'vehicle', '8216', 'Short', 'Term', '12', '8217', 'not', 'short', 'shocking', 'moments', 'emotional', 'connection.And', 'boy', 'ensemble', 'sing.Larson', 'received', 'bulk', 'praise', 'sure', 'honestly', 'am', 'struggling', 'understand', 'why', 'Kaitlyn', 'Dever', 'didn', '8217', 'get', 'Oscar', 'campaign', 'pain', 'passion', 'energy', 'commanding', 'honesty', 'portrayal', 'Jayden', 'electrifying', 'completely', 'scene', 'feel', 'so', 'genuine', 'even', 'when', '8217', 'having', 'such', 'outlandish', 'theatrical', 'meltdowns', 'know', 'girl', '8217', 'been', 'girl', 'want', 'heal', 'girl.Destin', 'Cretton', 'marvelous', 'job', 'crafting', 'film', 'be', 'something', 'so', 'special', 'so', 'human', 'heartfelt', 'perfect', 'movie', 'movie', 'own', 'snapshot', 'lives', 'young', 'people', 'growing', 'taking', 'care', 'young', 'people', 'while', 'trying', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'when', 'odds', 'are', 'stacked']",N/A

In a nutshell this film is an excellent depiction of the lives of emotionally scarred teenagers who live in state sponsored group environments and the people whose job it is to supervise them.  If the film focused exclusively on the children and their plight I would have no nits to pick.  What gave me pause is what I felt was a plot contrivance involving a supervisor named Grace played by Brie Larson, who is quite good, whose life becomes emotionally undone when a teenage girl is admitted to the facility whose past mirrors her own.  It's quite obvious that Grace is on the verge of a nervous breakdown and the question I ask myself is why is she in her obviously diminished capacity caring for vulnerable children?  Judging from the understandably overwhelming positive response to this film you would ask me why quibble but it's hard to overlook this aspect when probably half the film is devoted to it.

Brie Larson (""Grace"") and John Gallagher (""Mason"") give fine performances as the young staff members who must be simultaneously authoritarian, self-effacing, firm, gentle, and everything else a particular moment requires. The way they lose themselves in order to find themselves in this consuming, exhausting job, the kinship they share with the teenagers, and the one they lack with the upper administration is ultra-real. Equally impressive is Stephanie Beatriz as Jessica, full of rage and estranged from her family for good reasons the film reveals. That being said, everyone in this film is quite convincing.While it may be a little inconclusive in one or two spots, the plot is still compelling, with some truly disturbing surprises and revelations. SHORT TERM 12 also does a splendid job of balancing comedy and tragedy, connecting them together with various things that fall under both categories.

1671609,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00FGVRZOM,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","Much-lauded on its original release by critics and viewers alike, SHORT TERM 12 is a powerful drama set in a foster home, where twentysomething carer Grace (Brie Larson), and her fellow-workers Mason (John Gallagher Jr) and Nate (Rami Melek) spend their lives looking after disturbed or abused teenagers, including Marcus (Keith Stanfield), Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), and Sammy (Alex Calloway).  Their job certainly isn't easy: many of these teenagers have had difficult lives, and find it very difficult to talk about their experiences.  Sometimes Grace gets into conflict with her superior Jack (Frantz Turner), in the belief that not enough attention has been paid by the so-called professionals towards the teenagers' plight.  However Grace herself is not without problems: we learn that she has had a disturbed childhood - so disturbed, in fact, that she cannot even talk about it to Mason.  The prospect of her father being released on probation from prison fills her with horror.  Destin Daniel Cretton's production contains some powerful performances, notable from Larson and Dever, whose characters develop a bond with one another, despite their difficulties.  However the script is marred by some obvious implausibilities: if Grace has had such a disturbed past, one wonders why she has been put in a position of such responsibility at the foster home.  In one sequence she is shown entering Jayden's house, while Jayden is at home, using the front door key concealed under the doormat.  One wonders why the key is kept there when the family are at home.  Jayden and Grace smash up Jayden's father's car with a baseball bat, but no one - not even the police - visits the foster home to investigate what has happened.  There is a happy ending, but it seems rather contrived, as the director wanted above all to show that these kids - Grace included - could be redeemed, so long as people made the effort to understand them.

1671610,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B00FGVRZOM,DVD Verdict,"[1, 1]","I hope that 2013 will be remembered as the tipping point, when everyone realized that films helmed by female characters could attract everyone to the box office. No longer just the province of the women's demographic (a la Sex and the City), mainstream films in 2013 like Frozen and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire showed that the world will go see stories about women and girls just as they will stories front by men and boys. Though indie film is far from perfect, a picture like Short Term 12 reminds us that films anchored by strong female leads have long been the province of independent film. Thanks to a stellar performance by Brie Larson and assured direction from Destin Cretton, Short Term 12 transcends its roots in melodrama to become an oddly affecting indie portrait.Grace (Brie Larson, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) works as a supervisor at Short Term 12, a group home for teens having trouble in the system. She has a boyfriend she loves in co-worker Mason (John Gallagher Jr., The Newsroom), she's good at her job, and things seems to be going well for her. Then she finds out she's pregnant, and a new girl with big problems comes to stay at Short Term 12, complicating her formerly simple life.Many people get confused and think that wonder is the highest feeling to which art can aspire. In other words, to leave the audience asking &#34;How did they do that?&#34; I would argue, however, that it takes even more skill to explain to the audience what's being done and still pull them in. Such is the case with Short Term 12. From the opening scene, with its easy dialogue between a group of seasoned staffers and a newbie, it's obvious how and where this film is going to go. The story that one of the seasoned members tells involves him defecating himself, so immediately we know this will not be a whitewashed portrait of foster care. However, all the staffers are warm and laughing, letting us know this will not be a cynical takedown of the foster system. The camera roams around, seemingly handheld and following character after character, nimble and responsive. There's a low-budget, fly-on-the-wall feel to the presentation. We know from the beginning that this is going to be a naturalistic indie drama with some serious feel-good potential.In moments like this I'm inclined to be cynical. I know I'm being lead to a particular emotional level, and I want to resist. The strength of Short Term 12 is that it manages to overcome exactly those suspicions. Most of that is down to an impressive performance by Brie Larson. She's the center of the narrative, and it's through her eyes that we see the world of Short Term 12 and its denizens. She's a perfectly rounded character, able to hold her own as the in-charge supervisor without sacrificing her more emotional moments in more personal settings. The rest of the cast support her ably. John Gallagher Jr. is especially good as Mason, but the teens deserve a shout-out for their surprising naturalism. The rest of the success of the picture lies with the fact that Cretton lets his technique fall into the background. Though the first scene announces the handheld indie cred, for the most part the film lets that be enough, not rubbing the audience's nose in the &#34;realness&#34; of the camerawork.Short Term 12 (Blu-ray) is also solid. The 1.85:1/1080p AVC-encoded transfer is clean and bright. The color scheme is slightly desaturated, but detail is strong throughout. Black levels aren't the deepest, but they are consistent. For an indie-style feature, the flick looks really good. The DTS-HD 5.1 audio track is similarly impressive. Dialogue is clean and clear, and there's impressive fidelity in the musical cues. The surrounds even get a bit of use during more chaotic scenes in the home.Extras start with a set of deleted scenes that largely flesh out character moments, offering 22 minutes of extra scenes. We then get three featurettes. The first focuses on the making of the film, the second on its music, and the third on a screening of the film attended by the cast and crew. The feature is based on a short film, and that original short is included here as well, which is a welcome addition that allows us to see how the narrative developed. Finally, there's a set of teasers and trailers for the film, along with information about &#34;outreach partners&#34; for foster care. There's also a DVD copy of the film in this release as well.\Gordon Sullivan, DVD VERDICTRead the full review at dvdverdict.com",4,Well-acted take on smaller human moments,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,4497,"['hope', '2013', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'tipping', 'point', 'when', 'everyone', 'realized', 'films', 'helmed', 'female', 'characters', 'could', 'attract', 'everyone', 'box', 'office', 'No', 'longer', 'just', 'province', 'women', 'demographic', 'la', 'Sex', 'City', 'mainstream', 'films', '2013', 'Frozen', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'Catching', 'Fire', 'showed', 'world', 'will', 'go', 'see', 'stories', 'women', 'girls', 'just', 'will', 'stories', 'front', 'men', 'boys', 'indie', 'film', 'far', 'perfect', 'picture', 'Short', 'Term', '12', 'films', 'anchored', 'strong', 'female', 'leads', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'province', 'independent', 'film', 'Thanks', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'assured', 'direction', 'Destin', 'Cretton', 'Short', 'Term', '12', 'roots', 'melodrama', 'become', 'oddly', 'affecting', 'indie', 'portrait.Grace', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'World', 'supervisor', 'Short', 'Term', '12', 'group', 'home', 'teens', 'having', 'trouble', 'system', 'boyfriend', 'co-worker', 'Mason', 'John', 'Gallagher', 'Jr.', 'Newsroom', 'good', 'job', 'things', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'Then', 'out', 'pregnant', 'new', 'girl', 'big', 'problems', 'stay', 'Short', 'Term', '12', 'complicating', 'formerly', 'simple', 'life.Many', 'people', 'get', 'confused', 'think', 'wonder', 'highest', 'feeling', 'art', 'can', 'aspire', 'other', 'words', 'leave', 'audience', 'asking', '34', 'How', 'did', 'do', '34', 'would', 'argue', 'however', 'even', 'more', 'skill', 'explain', 'audience', 'what', 'being', 'done', 'still', 'pull', 'Such', 'case', 'Short', 'Term', '12', 'opening', 'scene', 'easy', 'dialogue', 'group', 'seasoned', 'staffers', 'newbie', 'obvious', 'how', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'go', 'story', 'one', 'seasoned', 'members', 'tells', 'defecating', 'so', 'immediately', 'know', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'whitewashed', 'portrait', 'foster', 'care', 'However', 'staffers', 'are', 'warm', 'laughing', 'letting', 'know', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'cynical', 'takedown', 'foster', 'system', 'camera', 'roams', 'seemingly', 'handheld', 'following', 'character', 'character', 'nimble', 'responsive', 'low-budget', 'fly-on-the-wall', 'feel', 'presentation', 'know', 'beginning', 'going', 'be', 'naturalistic', 'indie', 'drama', 'serious', 'feel-good', 'potential.In', 'moments', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'be', 'cynical', 'know', ""'m"", 'being', 'lead', 'particular', 'emotional', 'level', 'want', 'resist', 'strength', 'Short', 'Term', '12', 'overcome', 'exactly', 'suspicions', 'Most', 'down', 'impressive', 'performance', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'center', 'narrative', 'eyes', 'see', 'world', 'Short', 'Term', '12', 'denizens', 'perfectly', 'rounded', 'character', 'able', 'hold', 'own', 'in-charge', 'supervisor', 'sacrificing', 'more', 'emotional', 'moments', 'more', 'personal', 'settings', 'rest', 'cast', 'support', 'ably', 'John', 'Gallagher', 'Jr.', 'especially', 'good', 'Mason', 'teens', 'deserve', 'shout-out', 'surprising', 'naturalism', 'rest', 'success', 'picture', 'fact', 'Cretton', 'technique', 'fall', 'background', 'first', 'scene', 'handheld', 'indie', 'cred', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'be', 'enough', 'not', 'rubbing', 'audience', 'nose', '34', 'realness', '34', 'camerawork.Short', 'Term', '12', 'Blu-ray', 'also', 'solid', '1.85:1/1080p', 'AVC-encoded', 'transfer', 'clean', 'bright', 'color', 'scheme', 'slightly', 'desaturated', 'detail', 'strong', 'Black', 'levels', 'are', ""n't"", 'deepest', 'are', 'consistent', 'indie-style', 'feature', 'flick', 'really', 'good', 'DTS-HD', '5.1', 'audio', 'track', 'similarly', 'impressive', 'Dialogue', 'clean', 'clear', 'impressive', 'fidelity', 'musical', 'cues', 'surrounds', 'even', 'get', 'bit', 'use', 'more', 'chaotic', 'scenes', 'home.Extras', 'start', 'set', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'largely', 'out', 'character', 'moments', 'offering', '22', 'minutes', 'extra', 'scenes', 'then', 'get', 'three', 'featurettes', 'first', 'making', 'film', 'second', 'music', 'third', 'screening', 'film', 'attended', 'cast', 'crew', 'feature', 'based', 'short', 'film', 'original', 'short', 'included', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'welcome', 'addition', 'see', 'how', 'narrative', 'developed', 'Finally', 'set', 'teasers', 'trailers', 'film', 'information', '34', 'outreach', 'partners', '34', 'foster', 'care', 'also', 'DVD', 'copy', 'film', 'release', 'well.\\Gordon', 'Sullivan', 'DVD', 'VERDICTRead', 'full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",N/A

Grace (Brie Larsen) works at a youth safe house with her boyfriend Mason (John Gallagher). They don't council or befriend the residents. They just provide a safe haven for these youths until they move onto the next phase of their lives. A troubled young girl enters the facility and throws Grace into a tailspin as she dredges up the darker side of her past.This is an Indy film in the best and truest sense. There is no b.s. here. It's all writing and acting and it rings true to the ear and heart. I was so drawn into this I felt as though I were watching something real happening and not a dramatization of something real. The dialogue rang true and was delivered in a very subtle fashion. All the actors were very comfortable in front of the camera. There were a lot of nifty tunes throughout and the other production values were on par with the story.What's happening here is the story. It's good and believable.

As a former foster child myself, this movie was definitely something I could easily relate to. And I don't bring that up for sympathy or for credit, but just an added reason of why today I chose to review the film: Short Term 12.Grace is an worker at a Group Home for teenagers. We are introduced to her co-workers: Jessica, Nate, and Mason who is also Grace's boyfriend. Soon we see kids: Marcus, who has a talent for making words rhyme, Luis who has a knack for trouble, Sammy who tries to runaway from time to time, and finally Jayden a troubled girl with a gifted artistic ability.I will start by saying I wish Brie Larson had been nominated at least for a Golden Globe award. As Grace, she embodies the qualities of dedication, and resilience so well, that it is almost hard not to believe she is not a case worker in real life. And as for the kids involved, they get the stamp of approval just as well. A few times during the movie I was moved to tears, while other times I found myself delighted.Short Term 12 has great acting, great direction and a positively believable story line behind it.

Oleson,"[0, 0]","Director/writer Destin Cretton expands on his 21 minute film from 2008 of the same name, and delivers a powerful film with some great young actors.  The title references a foster care facility that houses ""at risk"" teens until they are 18.  The caretakers are young adults not much older than those they supervise.In a wonderful performance, Brie Larson (""The Spectacular Now"") is the senior staff member.  She has a not so secret relationship with Mason (John Gallagher Jr., TV's ""The Newsroom""), another staffer.  Most of the kids here seem well settled in the home, but there are a few, of course, that stand out, either needing additional psychological help or something else.  When Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever, also from ""The Spectacular Now"" and TV's ""Justified"") shows up, Grace (Larson) sees something of herself in the girl.  As time goes on she suspects abuse which brings out hidden memories of her own.Discovering that she is pregnant, Grace and Mason want to get married, but repressed feelings continue to hamper their relationship.  This could have been one of those straight to DVD or commercial TV shlockfests, but this movie feels very real.  Shot with handheld cameras throughout much of the film, the scenes get a bit dizzying at times.  But the film has honest emotion, fine humor and some terrific performances, especially from the young women.  I suspect they will be around for some time.  Highly recommended.There is nothing wrong with the Blu ray transfer which comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Granted the transfer seems a bit dull at times but I think most of this is due to the clothing worn by the actors and the somewhat basic surroundings of the home.  Detail is fine and everything is sharp most of the time.  There are some inconsistencies which seem to be the camera focus as much as anything.  There's nothing to complain about with the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 lossless audio track either.  Certainly nothing spectacular which is to be expected.  The dialog is clear and clean.  The film comes with subtitles in Spanish, French and English SDH.  Extras include a behind the scenes piece, another entitled ""Making the Music,"" some deleted scenes, the original short film, and a few trailers.",4,(BLU RAY REVIEW) Excellent indi-film with some fine young actors,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,2251,"['Director/writer', 'Destin', 'Cretton', '21', 'minute', 'film', '2008', 'same', 'name', 'powerful', 'film', 'great', 'young', 'actors', 'title', 'foster', 'care', 'facility', 'houses', 'risk', 'teens', 'are', '18', 'caretakers', 'are', 'young', 'adults', 'not', 'much', 'older', 'supervise.In', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'Spectacular', 'Now', 'senior', 'staff', 'member', 'not', 'so', 'secret', 'relationship', 'Mason', 'John', 'Gallagher', 'Jr.', 'TV', 'Newsroom', 'staffer', 'Most', 'kids', 'here', 'seem', 'well', 'settled', 'home', 'are', 'few', 'course', 'stand', 'out', 'either', 'needing', 'additional', 'psychological', 'help', 'something', 'else', 'When', 'Jayden', 'Kaitlyn', 'Dever', 'also', 'Spectacular', 'Now', 'TV', 'Justified', 'up', 'Grace', 'Larson', 'something', 'herself', 'girl', 'time', 'abuse', 'out', 'hidden', 'memories', 'own.Discovering', 'pregnant', 'Grace', 'Mason', 'want', 'get', 'married', 'repressed', 'feelings', 'continue', 'hamper', 'relationship', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'straight', 'DVD', 'commercial', 'TV', 'shlockfests', 'movie', 'very', 'real', 'Shot', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'much', 'film', 'scenes', 'get', 'bit', 'dizzying', 'times', 'film', 'honest', 'emotion', 'fine', 'humor', 'terrific', 'performances', 'especially', 'young', 'women', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'time', 'Highly', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', '1080p', 'video', 'resolution', '1.85:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Granted', 'transfer', 'bit', 'dull', 'times', 'think', 'most', 'due', 'clothing', 'worn', 'actors', 'somewhat', 'basic', 'surroundings', 'home', 'Detail', 'fine', 'everything', 'sharp', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'inconsistencies', 'seem', 'be', 'camera', 'focus', 'as', 'much', 'anything', 'nothing', 'complain', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'lossless', 'audio', 'track', 'Certainly', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'be', 'expected', 'dialog', 'clear', 'clean', 'film', 'subtitles', 'Spanish', 'French', 'English', 'SDH', 'Extras', 'include', 'scenes', 'piece', 'entitled', 'Making', 'Music', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'original', 'short', 'film', 'few', 'trailers']",N/A

1671626,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00FGVRZOM,Paul Allaer,"[12, 16]","""Short Term 12"" (2013 release; 97 min.) is the story of the people in a youth foster care facility called Short Term 12 (as the kids are not expected to stay longer than 1 year--although we learn that some do). The movie opens with two of the youth counselors, Grace (played by Brie Larson) and Mason (played by John Gallagher Jr.), welcoming a new colleague, Nate. Later on, we learn that Grace and Mason are long-time live-in girlfriend/boyfriend. We then get to know some of the troubled youth in Short Term 12, most prominent among them being Marcus, who is nearing his 18th birthday (the maximum age allowed in that facility) and is dreading to leave. Also prominent is Jayden, a 15 or 16 yr. girl (played by Kaitlyn Dever), who seems very on edge for reasons net yet clear until much later in the movie. Back to Grace and Mason: they try to guide these youth as best as they can, while at the same time they are hitting some rough spots in their own relationship, particularly as Grace learns she is pregnant. At this point we are less than 30 minutes into the movie, and to tell you more would ruin your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this is a HEAVY youth and relationship drama. Only minutes into the movie (after the laugh-inducing opening sequence where Grace and Mason welcome Nate), we get right away into the thick of things, and it doesn't let up from there at all. Second, there are several scenes that will punch you into the (emotional) gut. When Marcus gets into trouble yet again (for fighting), he takes out his anger by writing a rap song, and sings it, begging the counselors to ""look into my eyes so you know what it's like"". They can't know, of course. Even harder is the scene with Jayden when she opens up to Grace and tells Grace a child story she made up called ""Nina and the Shark"", about a shark becoming friends with an octopus. I won't say more, just watch! Third, this is for me mostly a cast of unknowns, and one is better than the other, but I do want to point out Kaitlyn Dever as the troubled girl, she is ace. And then of course there is Brie Larson, who carries the movie on her shoulders. She is the true revelation of this movie for me. Surely we have not seen the last of her. Last but certainly not least, kudos to writer-director Destin Cretton, who made this movie based on his own shortie of the same title of a few years ago.This movie made quite a splash when it premiered at the SXSW film festival earlier this year, and I had been eagerly looking forward to seeing it. The movie came out recently at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, and I went to see it right away. So glad I did, as I absolutely love this movie. Even better, the screening I saw this at was very well attended for a matinee, which seems to indicate there may well be a strong demand for this movie. Bottom line, if you are in the mood for a quality indie movie bringing you an excellent youth and relationship drama that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this.

The director/writer, Daniel Cretton worked in such a place, and knows of what he writes.Grace, played brilliantly by Brie Larson, is the chief counselor so to speak. She has her eyes on all the kids, and seems to be able to deal with the emotional and physical outbursts all at once. Her boyfriend, Mason, played by John Gallagher, Jr is also perfect for this job. BTW, Gallagher has a strong role in the HBO series, 'The Newsroom', see if you can figure that one out. Both Grace and Mason come from great dysfunction as you soon learn. The participants in this home all have issues as you would expect. We come into the picture when one of them will be turning 18 and leaving the facility soon. At the same time, a very troubled young woman comes to the facility that takes everyone's time and attention.  To use the cliche, 'on a roller coaster' is very true of this film. Raw emotions surface, again and again, and you will find yourself on the verge of tears.The acting is superb in this film. Each character gives much, and we take it all in.

Usually I am so annoyed by something that I read or watched that I take to Amazon in order to eviscerate it (I'm looking at you Curse of Chucky), but this is a movie that has humble charms and meager ambitions that it's hard not to love it, first for what it is and then for what it is not.It is a sleeper movie about case workers in a mental health clinic for teenagers. They go through their days telling stories and dealing with the clients in a very real way. They have to chase down the clients running away and they have rules and protocols to follow. At the center of the movie is a romance between the main case workers who know that they have been hurt by life and they try to get over their baggage in order to be there for each other. There's also a pregnancy story and stories about how the case workers interact with the patients, including a new one that has issues that echo the Alison Brie characters life story.More importantly, this movie is NOT a melodrama. It does not have the big moments or histrionics that you get out of movies that deal with mental health. It is not trying to tell us that mental illness is some kind of a magic formula to individualism. There is not a suicide twenty minutes before the end that makes everyone question their life choices. No one is &#34;cured&#34; so much as slowly and painfully finds ways to deal with their issues - but those issues never go away.
