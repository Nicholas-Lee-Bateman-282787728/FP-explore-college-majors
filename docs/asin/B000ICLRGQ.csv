Let me say from the start that I am a big Frank Sinatra fan from a family of three generations of Sinatra fans, but I must tell you that Bobby Darin had more stage presence, more rhythm, and tons more magneticism that Sinatra. In the years prior to his tragically untimely death, his voice---though not as powerful as in his youth, was growing deeper and richer (he could sing up a storm, particularly in the lower register) and he could hold a note, despite a terribly diseased heart, longer than any pop/jazz singer I've ever heard. Despite being only months from his death when most of the cuts on this DVD were filmed, his singing looked and sounded effortless---like he was at the top of his game. Listen to him sing the great standard jazz ballads ""Come Rain or Come Shine"" and ""Cry Me A River."" His sense of timing and drama is unrivaled. On the uptempo tunes like ""Artifical Flowers"" and ""Caravan"" he swings like no other singer ever. He sings blues, jazz, pop, country...you name the genre and he sings it like nobody's business. You'll also see him play harmonica, vibraphones, piano, etc. This is a great DVD of a great entertainer whose life was cut far too short. He might have been the best of them all. It has been said by many in the entertainment industry that Darin was the only performer who intimidated Frank. After watching this DVD, you'll understand why. I recommend it with great enthusiasm.",5,Great DVD!

Highlights include his classic hits, ""Mack the Knife"", ""If I were a Carpenter"" and ""beyond the Sea"", but some suprises like the bluesy ""Work Song"",""Sweet Caroline"" and ""Mame"" to name a few. Bobby swings thru many of the hit songs of the time. My favorite ""Higher and Higher"" is one of Bobby's supercharged songs. You can't help but glide along the stage with him.

It seems like these songs were recorded just yesterday.  They are fresh and so powerful.  No one, and I mean absolutely no one, could perform the way Bobby Darin did.  He was one of a kind.  A true legend.  He is sorely missed.  In the 33 years since his untimely passing, there has been no one to equal him.  I doubt that there ever will be.

1019800,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B000ICLRGQ,Mel Odom,"[20, 20]","As a kid, I was familiar with Bobby Darin's ""Splish, Splash,"" and I'd even seen him on television a few times.  In the 1970s when I was a teen he had a show on and I remember seeing it every now and then.  His music is still with us, and every now and then his picture is too.However, I'd never realized how talented he was until I got this DVD and watched it.  Bobby Darin had a gift, not just for music or acting or handling business affairs, but for winning over audiences he played in front of.  I watched as he won over the television audiences performance after performance, but he won me over too.I love live music.  There's nothing like it.  But with Bobby Darin gone, this is as close as it gets.  What I saw in his performances was a man in love with what he was doing.  He shines with the zest he has for being in front of those people.  I didn't get the impression he was all that aware of the camera, but he knew those people were in the room.At 37, Bobby Darin succumbed to a diseased heart he'd dealt with all his life.  He'd been told since he was a child that he'd have a short life, and he did.  But it would have been fascinating to see what he would have been like if he'd had more time.Kevin Spacey, an ardent admirer of Darin's, helped put together a biopic of Bobby Darin's life.  The movie, BEYOND THE SEA, is on DVD now.  I wish SEEING IS BELIEVING would have had some interviews, but it's okay because now this DVD has made me curious enough to seek out Spacey's movie.Get the DVD and sit down with Bobby Darin for an hour.

1019801,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B000ICLRGQ,Phil S.,"[3, 3]","I wish more DVD-compilation Producers would do what Mr. Scalia has done with this exquisite ""keeper"" - the full performances, no tired interviews interspersed with embarrassing glorifications, no unnecessary graphics to crowd the frames. (Though a prefacing or closing statement as to time and place would have been nice).Talent and showmanship aside, this artist's catalogue can actually overwhlem the senses: it's all first-class and contains an amazing A & R range. '50s Rock and Roll, Pop, Middle-of-the Road, Country, Jazz, standards - I never heard a dud. Darin was in the best tradition of distinguished show people who obviously believed in quality control - just witness the extaordinary show band he had - I gotta ""Google"" the name and career of his drummer from those '70s-appearing shows.As everyone knows, Bobby appeared on the Mike Douglas Show as co-host for one week in July of 1970, and I recall the duet he did with Little Richard, on his arrangement of Muddy Waters' ""I've Got My Mojo Working"" - Bobby actually played piano! I did purchase this DVD hoping that this title would be taken from that telecast, reported as 07-29-70. It is another rendition from that decade, with BD playing vibes.

1019803,AX3T5TI76TOJ1,B000ICLRGQ,TurquoiseEyes13579,"[1, 1]","Bobby Darin was one of those performers who simply transformed a stage into a party every time. His unmatched charisma, understated sexiness, vocal power, control & range would melt even the coldest woman's heart. He could play guitar, piano & several other instruments, and play them well. He was a great footloose dancer, and moved around & across a stage better than anyone I've ever seen with such high vocal ability. Many times, such ""tricks"" are used to distract a listener from vocal flaws that the performer wants hidden- however, in Mr. Darin's case, he could move like Elvis & still belt out like Andy Williams (another flawless singer, and another favorite of mine), all at the same time. But Bobby could also just stand still, under a single spotlight, and w/ those deep, soulful eyes of his, literally put you in a dream state over the music he sang. Nothing in his performances- the backup singers, his band, the setting- was less than good. This man was born for performing. The set was merely an extension of Bobby himself- he owned it all. While he handled standards beautifully, he could also sing folk music, rock-and-roll, blues & other types of music without sounding at all out-of-place or contrived. Versatility was certainly one of his many strengths, and that's what you get here in this collection. It is not a one-off concert, but is instead comprised of Bobby's various performances- most were for TV, some weren't. In all cases, the entire song is always played- there are no cut-off songs, and there is no narrator distracting the viewer w/ unnecessary chatter. Bobby's work stood for itself, and will stand up well for decades to come.Bobby could take even the most mundane material & make it easy to listen to, even impressive. Such is the case w/ songs like ""Artificial Flowers""- no great lyrical masterpiece, but Bobby's kicked-up version vastly improves the music's likeability. Too often, great lyrical material goes to singers who simply can't make the most of it, or vice versa- a performer may have the voice of an angel, but never gets the songs that truly show off their potential. While not every song Bobby sang was an absolute gem, his own interpretation was always magical. This collection is a broad selection, spanning his entire career, but it's really focusing on his last concert & TV performances. Watching this DVD made me go out & buy every record of his that I could find, because I just couldn't get enough of his unique, beautiful voice. I long for the days when the industry was made up of people who came up the hard way (through real work), and were total professionals. I am very sad that the generation being raised today, and even those in my own age group, are mostly unaware of the Bobby Darin catalog. He was not only talented, but good-looking & intelligent, a man's man, yet possessing a sensitivity that pulsated through the screen.The songs which stand out for me are ""Cry Me a River"", ""Happy"", and especially, his version of ""Sweet Caroline"". Neil Diamond...no offense, buddy, but Bobby's version is superior in every way. The first time my mother & I heard Bobby singing ""Sweet Caroline"", we sat there w/ our jaws hitting the ground. Prepare to break out your best speakers & get comfy, because it is worth it. I was unfamiliar w/ his material at that time, but my mother wasn't, and even she was floored.We're both heavy music listeners, but we'd never heard this version before. Thank goodness this performance was filmed. An utter knockout, it is unfathomable to me that this song was shunned from radio airplay, as was much of Bobby's later work. ""Cry Me a River"", in which Bobby focused his eyes on the camera in close-up, seemed to be sung directly at a love who had done him wrong (perhaps Sandra Dee). He could imbue so much emotion into a song that it almost made his feelings transparent onscreen. While that doesn't sound really impressive, it is both moving to watch & is a difficult feat for any performer to pull off. He was willing to expose his soul to the audience, and what a lovely soul it was. Many, many fans seem to care mostly for his 1950's & early-to-mid 1960's work, but frankly, it wasn't until later that his his already full & magnificent voice was completely developed. My heart is w/ his later work, personally. His performances went from great to absolutely spectacular. He crammed more talent into each show than a lot of people can do in a year's worth of concerts. This is especially bewildering his fragile health in the last years of his life. Watching Bobby perform these w/ what seems like perfect comfort & ease, you'd never know he needed an oxygen tank backstage, for example. If he ever felt sick, nervous or tired, he certainly never showed it when it came time to please the crowd. His breath control, long-held-out phrases & precise low & high notes are astounding by any standard, but when you look at the heart condition he had, I'm at a loss as to how he physically sang at all, let alone so perfectly. He may have passed away nearly four decades ago, but thankfully, his catalogue of tunes is preserved for those of us not fortunate enough to live when he was a hitmaker. This is a DVD the entire family can watch & enjoy, too.",5,"A superb, well-rounded live collection of Bobby's work",1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,5248,"['Bobby', 'Darin', 'was', 'one', 'performers',
