1436946,A5EKUC02QJKWE,B0051MKN5O,"A. Rodriguez ""Kapuffy""","[1, 1]","""Take Me Home Tonight"" is not a movie meant to inspire huge, gut-wrenching laughs, nor is it meant to be a movie that will stand the test of time. I perceived it as a true homage to the movies of the 80's, primarily those directed by the spirited John Hughes. The fact that this is 2011 and the movie takes place in the 80's did not help it in the box office, I'm sure...not to mention that the film was very poorly marketed. There is barely an audience for this type of movie anymore: the 80's generation would call it a copycat of John Hughes's superior films and newer generations would barely consider it relevant. I, for one, cannot deny that I was completely enthralled by it every step of the way. Matt Franklin (Topher Grace) is a character that I'm sure plenty of young men can relate to; I could, and Topher Grace almost seems like he was playing himself, as if the character were meant to be played by him. His competent yet complacent sister, Wendy, is played with a lot of tact and subtlety by Anna Faris, which was surprising to me given the fact that she sky-rocketed her career playing an extremely oblivious, ditsy blonde in the Scary Movie(s) and Just Friends. I have heard many negative reviews of this movie and a lot of haters saying ""been-there-done-that."" Yes, I agree this is very familiar territory, but it hasn't been explored with such sincerity for two decades, and it's fun to see modern-day actors decked out in 80's gear and exhibiting that old- school sensibility. The film is, essentially, a simple party-hardy oddyssey like Sixteen Candles, Can't Hardly Wait, and Detroit Rock City. The acting, from the lead players, was not over-the-top or sappy, but very honest; the dialogue did not feel contrived, on the contrary, it had its clever wit and surprising charm. Don't go in here expecting a spectacular film and don't go here expecting to see something that's never been done before, because it has, and it's been done better. But, if you watch this film and accept it for what it is, acknowledge it for what it is, then I think you will be as pleasantly surprised as I was. I enjoyed it; it made me nostalgic of a time I wasn't even born in (and that's saying something), and it knew when and where to implement its soundtrack. The hardcore beauty and complexity of 80's pop culture is well represented here. It is obvious Director Michael Dowse had a passion for this material, and he approached it in a way that was simple, heartfelt, and clever rather than sappy, cheesy, and overly grotesque. I know people will disagree with my review and still say this movie ""sucked,"" and it's a pity, because it is rare to see a movie that uses its style and music to remind people of a time, not so long ago, when music was not all about sex and hardcore drug usage, when styles reinvented not defined the individual, and when dancing required two people to become well acquainted with the other's face.

I had seen the the previews on TV a couple of times, however, other than that I knew nothing about the movie. I found Take Me Home Tonight hysterically funny at times and other times slow and boring. I wasn't completely disappointed in the movie and I did enjoy the 80's music going on at the party. The dance off at the party by Dan Fogler was one of the best parts of the movie. As Dan tries to out-dance some dude with a bandanna, he ends up looking like the fool he truly is, but not before ending it with a couple groin kicks. In fact, the music throughout the movie was enjoyable. The beginning was rather slow but after stealing an old Mercedes, Topher and Dan went joy-riding on their way to the party and the movie picked up steam and became more humorous after that. I think if you get by the slow start, you can enjoy the movie.

1436948,AGZZM0UG0PPGA,B0051MKN5O,"Beeshy ""AliciA""","[14, 16]","Take Me Home Tonight is a movie for people who love 80's movies. The soundtrack is reason enough to give this movie a go. Excellent picks perfectly placed. Pretty much ever 80's cliche is played out in this movie. The guy trying to get the girl that's totally out of his league, the best friend/comedic relief, the perfectly irritating couple, the awesome party that everyone attends, the crimes that should land you in jail, + the most awesome night of your life. Although not in high school the characters are post college grads instead. With the lead Matt(Topher Grace) struggling to get his life started after college + stuck in a dead end job for fear or failure. His twin Wendy(Anna Faris) is in a similar situation w/ her boyfrind. While his best friend Barry(Dan Fogler) skipped college for a job + is making up for a time he missed. Matt's high school crush Tori(Teresa Palmer) is a success in banking + still far out of his league. The night brings them all together at Wendy's boyfriend Kyle's(Chris Pratt) notorious Labor day weekend party. A bunch of ""No Way"" type situations make this movie pure 80's gold. One of which being the thieveing of a car from Barry's former employer. I don't want to give too much away cause you'll wanna see it for yourself it's that funny. You can tell that the cast had great chemistry and had fun making this movie which makes it all the better. This is a feel good type movie that will make you leave the theater laughing about your fav scenes. The movie is so much funnier than I expected + I was already expecting funnyness. If the trailer even looks a little funny to you then see this movie, you won't be disappointed.*check out the music video for ""Don't You Want Me"" by Atomic Tom it features the cast reenacting classic 80's movie moments*",5,An homage to 80's movies,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,1793,"['Take', 'Me', 'Home', 'Tonight', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'love', '80', 'movies', 'soundtrack', 'reason', 'enough', 'give', 'movie', 'go', 'Excellent', 'picks', 'perfectly', 'placed', 'Pretty', 'much', 'ever', '80', 'cliche', 'played', 'out', 'movie', 'guy', 'trying', 'get', 'girl', 'totally', 'league', 'best', 'friend/comedic', 'relief', 'perfectly', 'irritating', 'couple', 'awesome', 'party', 'everyone', 'attends', 'crimes', 'should', 'land', 'jail', '+', 'most', 'awesome', 'night', 'life', 'not', 'high', 'school', 'characters', 'are', 'post', 'college', 'grads', 'instead', 'lead', 'Matt', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'struggling', 'get', 'life', 'started', 'college', '+', 'stuck', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'fear', 'failure', 'twin', 'Wendy', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'similar', 'situation', 'w/', 'boyfrind', 'best', 'friend', 'Barry', 'Dan', 'Fogler', 'skipped', 'college', 'job', '+', 'making', 'up', 'time', 'missed', 'Matt', 'high', 'school', 'crush', 'Tori', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'success', 'banking', '+', 'still', 'far', 'league', 'night', 'together', 'Wendy', 'boyfriend', 'Kyle', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'notorious', 'Labor', 'day', 'weekend', 'party', 'bunch', 'Way', 'type', 'situations', 'make', 'movie', 'pure', '80', 'gold', 'One', 'being', 'thieveing', 'car', 'Barry', 'former', 'employer', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'cause', ""'ll"", 'wan', 'na', 'see', 'funny', 'can', 'tell', 'cast', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'had', 'fun', 'making', 'movie', 'better', 'feel', 'good', 'type', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'leave', 'theater', 'laughing', 'fav', 'scenes', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'funnier', 'expected', '+', 'was', 'already', 'expecting', 'funnyness', 'trailer', 'even', 'little', 'funny', 'then', 'see', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', '*check', 'music', 'video', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Want', 'Me', 'Atomic', 'Tom', 'cast', 'reenacting', 'classic', '80', 'movie', 'moments*']",N/A

1436950,A29QM4M1KVTWVF,B0051MKN5O,Bitter Bunny,"[1, 1]","I wish I could say this movie had heart and brains. When it makes all the essential references to the 1980's, it does so in an ill-guided effort to make itself legitimate, rather than use these as devices/props to give the storyline momentum and the relationships any weight. Also, the messages the movie attempts to teach are lost when everyone gets a clear slate and consequences for bad behavior are indiscernible. Thus, it misses the opportunity to set the appropriate tone and ends up with egg on its face.If you've seen Topher Grace in anything, you've seen him in this movie; this character, and by virtue this performance, has the potential for being a distant relative of one of Woody Allen's neurosis-driven characters albeit somewhat watered-down. In real life, I could never tell whether girls think that would be  a charming quality or a weakness to exploit (nice guys finish last?). Dan Fogler, Topher's  friend and sidekick, reminds me vaguely of a character in the movie Risky Business - Miles. In Miles' shining wisdom, he advises Tom Cruise's character to say `What the ---k"" because it gives you freedom, and freedom brings opportunity, which in turn makes your future. Fogler's character attempts to even out the `tread cautiously' aspects of Grace's, but overplays it and becomes obnoxious rather rapidly. Anna Faris plays Topher's twin sister - a person with a pleasant disposition bearing the obvious burden of being brainier than her boyfriend and confronting sharing a life with someone who considers activities like traveling inside a rapidly moving giant ball down a hill as `choice'. Teresa Palmer is gratifying as the `love interest' role as is Michael Biehn's performance in the role of Topher's dad trying to get him to live his life and take chances. A sorely missed opportunity was having Bob Odenkirk in the film without any speaking lines whatsoever.Bottom line: I doubt this movie was ever intended to make audiences reflect on their lives and inspire to change them for the better. This assumption lets it off the hook. However, what is left after giving it this generous consideration is a recycled love theme with predictable plot lines, pop-ish soundtrack and fair acting. It's perfectly suited for viewing as a background flick during naked twister night with friends, but otherwise it doesn't deserve your complete attention. It's a lightweight contender in the rom-com category and should be regarded with low expectations.",3,"Take it home, but not to meet the parents.",1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,2466,"['wish', 'could', 'say', 'movie', 'had', 'heart', 'brains', 'When', 'essential', 'references', '1980', 'so', 'ill-guided', 'effort', 'make', 'legitimate', 'rather', 'use', 'devices/props', 'give', 'storyline', 'momentum', 'relationships', 'weight', 'Also', 'messages', 'movie', 'teach', 'are', 'lost', 'when', 'everyone', 'clear', 'slate', 'consequences', 'bad', 'behavior', 'are', 'indiscernible', 'Thus', 'opportunity', 'set', 'appropriate', 'tone', 'up', 'egg', 'face.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'character', 'virtue', 'performance', 'potential', 'being', 'distant', 'relative', 'one', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'neurosis-driven', 'characters', 'somewhat', 'watered-down', 'real', 'life', 'could', 'never', 'tell', 'girls', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'charming', 'quality', 'weakness', 'exploit', 'nice', 'guys', 'finish', 'last', 'Dan', 'Fogler', 'Topher', 'friend', 'sidekick', 'vaguely', 'character', 'movie', 'Risky', 'Business', 'Miles', 'Miles', 'shining', 'wisdom', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'say', 'What', '-k', 'freedom', 'freedom', 'brings', 'opportunity', 'turn', 'future', 'Fogler', 'character', 'attempts', 'even', 'out', 'tread', 'cautiously', 'aspects', 'Grace', 'obnoxious', 'rather', 'rapidly', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Topher', 'twin', 'sister', 'person', 'pleasant', 'disposition', 'bearing', 'obvious', 'burden', 'being', 'brainier', 'boyfriend', 'confronting', 'sharing', 'life', 'someone', 'who', 'activities', 'traveling', 'rapidly', 'moving', 'giant', 'ball', 'down', 'hill', 'choice', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'gratifying', 'love', 'interest', 'role', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'performance', 'role', 'Topher', 'dad', 'trying', 'get', 'live', 'life', 'take', 'chances', 'sorely', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'was', 'having', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'film', 'speaking', 'lines', 'whatsoever.Bottom', 'line', 'doubt', 'movie', 'was', 'ever', 'intended', 'make', 'audiences', 'reflect', 'lives', 'inspire', 'change', 'better', 'assumption', 'off', 'hook', 'However', 'what', 'left', 'giving', 'generous', 'consideration', 'recycled', 'love', 'theme', 'predictable', 'plot', 'lines', 'pop-ish', 'soundtrack', 'fair', 'acting', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'viewing', 'background', 'flick', 'naked', 'twister', 'night', 'friends', 'otherwise', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'complete', 'attention', 'lightweight', 'contender', 'rom-com', 'category', 'should', 'be', 'regarded', 'low', 'expectations']",N/A

1436953,A2CT8CNACJFR51,B0051MKN5O,Cherese Vines,"[3, 4]","Take Me Home Tonight (film 2011)Starring Topher Grace and Anna FarisMy rating is 2 out of 5.Yes, harsh I know. And I usually like 80's throwback movies. The clothes alone are worth watching 80's inspired movies. I rented it from Redbox. I had a free code and it was between this or Bridesmaids. I had heard Bridesmaids was funny, but the lure of seeing 80's clothes and dancing was too strong.This movie is about this supposedly really smart guy, an MIT graduate, named Matt (Topher Grace) who works at a video store (the actual videos that have brown tape in them that takes 10 minutes to rewind). He does not know what he wants to do with his life, so he's not making any decisions at all. His twin sister Wendy (Anna Faris), who seems really smart too, has applied to graduate school and is too scared to open the letter from the university at the beginning of the movie and instead accepts a marriage proposal from her idiot boyfriend.First of all, they totally don't use Anna Faris' comedic talent in the movie. Then Topher Grace's character hovers between average and a loser. He sees his high school crush, Tori (who for the whole movie I thought was Kristen Stewart from those Twilight movies and she was actually Number 6 from the I Am Number Four movie), and spends the whole movie trying to woo her without telling her the whole truth about himself.It was a mediocre movie at best. Not even a good romantic comedy. And Topher's ""sidekick"" Barry (Dan Fogler) is not even funny. I did not laugh at this movie and the dancing was not 80's enough. Anybody could have played the part of Matt and Wendy. The music was classic 80's and I liked the songs. I knew some of them (not because I was an 80's child but because I listen to the Big 80's Weekend on B98.5 FM out of Atlanta every weekend.) The acting was decent, but the script was not really original in the least. I guess it was supposed to be like the movies from that era, and unfortunately became too much like the movies from that time concerning storyline.

I found all the characters to be perfectly cast as I followed them through this crazy night of partying, mischief and self discovery. This homage of a film pays its dues to the great, seems to not have a plot at all, but still is very entertaining and sentimental. Topher Grace cannot find himself, Dan Fogler loses himself, Anna Faris is stuck in between pleasing herself or her soon to be fiance, and Teresa Palmer finds a guy who has liked her since high school. The comedy does not lighten up during the film, but does mix a well amount of sentimental feeling to it which in my opinion makes the film stand out more than it would've if it just were goofy and over the top.The blu ray version of the film looks great in general. Colors are strong, and pores on peoples' faces are seen. There is a digital copy of the film that comes with the blu ray. The film is a moderate 97 minutes which goes by quickly and actually leaves you wanting more, or at least I could have had another 10 minutes.  Luckily this film has a decent amount of special features. They range from 7 hilarious deleted scenes that should have been added to film, a cast get together featurette, theatrical trailer, take me home tonight music video and an awesome music boombox featurette that includes 12 great 80's songs including ""straight outta COmpton"", ""video Killed the Radio Star"", ""kickstart my heart"", ""let my love open the door"" and "" dont you want me"".Personally, if you ask me...I'll say buy it. As soon as I finished watching it once I came to conclusion that I would not hesitate to watch again. It definitely is a feel good movie and I felt it did just that...put me in a good mood and had me thinking about those classic 80's movies.Give it a try, you won't be dissapointed.-Cam",5,"80's Zany Humor, An Awesome Retro Soundtrack and a Little Heart thrown in Makes this",1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,1800,"['thoughouly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'found', 'characters', 'be', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'followed', 'crazy', 'night', 'partying', 'mischief', 'self', 'discovery', 'homage', 'film', 'dues', 'great', 'not', 'have', 'plot', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'sentimental', 'Grace', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'Dan', 'Fogler', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'stuck', 'pleasing', 'soon', 'be', 'fiance', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'guy', 'who', 'liked', 'high', 'school', 'comedy', 'not', 'lighten', 'up', 'film', 'mix', 'well', 'amount', 'sentimental', 'feeling', 'opinion', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'more', 'would', ""'ve"", 'just', 'were', 'goofy', 'top.The', 'blu', 'ray', 'version', 'film', 'great', 'general', 'Colors', 'are', 'strong', 'pores', 'peoples', 'are', 'seen', 'digital', 'copy', 'film', 'blu', 'ray', 'film', 'moderate', '97', 'minutes', 'quickly', 'actually', 'wanting', 'more', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'had', '10', 'minutes', 'Luckily', 'film', 'decent', 'amount', 'special', 'features', 'range', '7', 'hilarious', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'film', 'cast', 'get', 'together', 'featurette', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'take', 'home', 'tonight', 'music', 'video', 'awesome', 'music', 'boombox', 'featurette', '12', 'great', '80', 'songs', 'including', 'straight', 'outta', 'COmpton', 'video', 'Killed', 'Radio', 'Star', 'kickstart', 'heart', 'let', 'love', 'open', 'door', 'dont', 'want', '.Personally', 'ask', ""'ll"", 'say', 'buy', 'As', 'soon', 'finished', 'watching', 'once', 'came', 'conclusion', 'would', 'not', 'hesitate', 'watch', 'again', 'definitely', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'felt', 'did', 'just', 'put', 'good', 'mood', 'had', 'thinking', 'classic', '80', 'movies.Give', 'try', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed.-Cam']",N/A

Amith (kndy),"[3, 7]","Filmmaker Michael Dowse maybe known for his films based on movie and beer and his FUBAR films have a big following in Canada and when you get opportunities to try some big, you go for it!Dowse went on to create the British film ""It's All Gone Pete Tong"" and in the U.S., the filmmaker got his opportunity to direct his first feature film ""Take Me Home Tonight"", a retro '80s comedy film starring Topher Grace (""That '70's Show"", ""Spider-Man 3', ""Predators""), Anna Faris (""Lost in Translation"", ""House Bunny"", ""Scary Movie"" films), Dan Fogler (""Balls of Fury"", ""Kung Fu Panda"", ""Fanboys""), ""Teresa Palmer"" (""I Am Number Four"", ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"") and Chris Pratt (""Jennifer's Body"", ""Bride Wars"", ""Wanted"").  The film would also benefit by its screenplay by Jackie and Jeff Filgo, known for their writing on TV shows such as ""That '70s Show"", ""Hank"" and ""New Adventures of Old Christine"" and the film ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"".Executive produced by Topher Grace, sex, drugs and rock n' roll is nothing new to the actor who pretty much did just that for ""That '70s Show"", but this time around, ""Take Me Home Tonight"" takes place in 1988 and a film bundled with popular '80s songs which include ""Hungry Like the Wolf"" by Duran Duran, ""Straight Outta Compton"" by NWA, ""Everybody Have Fun Tonight"" by Wang Chung, ""Come on Eileen"" by Dexy's Midnight Runners.But the film has had its challenges.  While completed in 2007, the film was shelved by Universal Studios and it took four years for it to be released in theaters.  Topher Grace said that the delay was due to the studio not knowing how to handle and promote a youth comedy film with portrayal of cocaine use.The film was eventually acquired by Relativity Media (subsidiary to Rogue) and released in theaters by Twentieth Century Fox in spring 2011.""Take Me Home Tonight"" takes place in 1988 and focuses on Matt Franklin (played by Topher Grace), a young man who excelled in school, excellent with numbers, graduated from MIT but is unsure what he wants to do with his life, he takes a job working at Suncoast Video with his twin sister Wendy (played by Anna Faris) and his best friend Barry Nathan (played by Dan Fogler).One day, while working at the shop, he runs into an old schoolmate who has started his own business and shocks his schoolmate when he tells him that he didn't work for a major company but is working at Suncoast Video.  When he sees his high school crush, Tori Fredreking (played by Teresa Palmer) come in to the store, Matt takes off his uniform and tries to pretend that he is shopping at the store.Both talk and Tori talks about how she works for an investment company and when she asks him where he works, he lies and tells her that he works at Goldman Sachs.  Tori asks if he is going to Kyle Masterson's (played by Chris Pratt) party and since his sister Wendy dates Kyle, Matt decides to go to the party (even though he doesn't like Kyle).Meanwhile, Matt's friend Barry has lost his other job (Working at a car lot) and in his drunken stupor, wants to get back at his boss by by stealing one of the nicer cars on the lot.As Matt and Barry drive to the party, they discover that the car has cocaine inside the glove compartment. Matt tries to prevent his friend from taking the drugs but since Barry is depressed, Barry takes the drugs along with him.While at the party, Matt tries to get close to Teresa, continuing his lie that he works at Goldman Sachs.  Meanwhile, Barry is drunk and now under the influence of cocaine and behaving crazily at the party.  Meanwhile, for Wendy, who has big dreams of going to a great college, she is suddenly shocked when her boyfriend Kyle proposes to her in front of everyone.  Matt is disappointing because she has a lot going for herself and worries that if she stays with Kyle, she would be nothing but a housewife.With Matt now trying to get close with Tori by lying, Barry trying to hide his depression by being drunk and on drugs and Wendy not knowing if she will pursue a life of marriage or education, this night will change the lives of these individuals from that day forward.""Take Me Home Tonight"" also stars Michael Biehn (""Terminator"", ""Aliens"", ""The Rock""), Michelle Trachtenberg (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Euro Trip"", ""Gossip Girl""), Lucy Punch (""Bad Teacher"", ""Dinner for Schmucks"", ""Hot Fuzz""),  mode/actress Angie Everhart and reality TV star Audrina Patridge.VIDEO:""Take Me Home Tonight"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:40:1).  Picture quality for the film is good but the majority of the film does take place during the night.  Skintones are natural and there is good detail as you can see the closeup of the '80s style clothing, the sweat (and that white powdery substance) on Dan Fogler's face.  I didn't notice any artifacts or banding, black levels are nice and deep and for the most part, picture quality is good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Take Me Home Tonight"" is a dialogue and music-driven film presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  While dialogue is crystal clear, the emphasis is the film's use of '80s music and in that sense, the music comes off quite clear via lossless.While the film does have it share of crowd ambiance during the two party sequences and also various crashing sequences, the film is pretty much dominated by dialogue and music.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Take Me Home Tonight"" comes with the following special features:Deleted Scenes - (11:00) Seven deleted scenesCast Get Together - (8:12) Topher Grace, Teresa Palmer, Anna Faris, Dan Fogler and Chris Pratt reunite to talk about their experience working on the film.Music Boombox - Featuring factoids on the various bands that performed the popular '80s music in the film.  You can select the scene of when the music is being played in the film.Take Me Home Tonight Music Video - (3:57) No, this is not the Eddie Money music video but Atomic Punk's cover of Human League's ""Don't You Want Me"" and featuring the cast of ""Take Me Home Tonight"" spoofing '80s films.Theatrical Trailer - (2:28) The original theatrical trailer.TV Spots  - (1:03) Two TV spots for the film.EXTRAS:""Take Me Home Tonight"" comes with a digital copy of the film.JUDGMENT CALL:Sex...alcohol...drugs, there was something about '80s films that made things feel right.Where '70s drive-in films were expected to be full of sexy, bad dialogue and excessive camp and violence, '80s films began to drop the hardcore violence and focused more on horny teenagers, crazy antics and nudity.  Sure, the '80s films had a sense of campiness but at least they were able to maintain that sense of underdog gets the hot girl banal storyline and-reuse it and still making it fresh and fun!From ""Porky's"", ""Private School"", ""Better Off Dead"", ""Animal House"", ""Zapped"", ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" to the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" films, there were so many of these films that were hilarious, fun and you couldn't stop watching them over and over.And then you had films that dealt with sex, alcohol and drugs...coming-of-age films with substance such as ""St. Elmo's Fire"", ""Pretty in Pink"" and ""Say Anything"" that featured crazy partying, drama, sex, etc. Films that were just right for the '80s. Films that were exciting, fun but yet had music that were part of pop culture.As a child of the '70s and a teenager of the '80s, I have had my opportunities to grow up and experience a lot of the '80s teen party or coming-of-age type of films.So, when I saw the commercials of ""Take Me Home Tonight"", I was very excited because I saw how Topher Grace was on ""That '70s Show"" and knowing that the writers behind the show were involved with this film, how can it fail?  Right?And the fact that it stars two stars known for their crazy comedy - Anna Faris and Dan Fogler, you just don't know what to expect.  Also, it was cool to know that Teresa Palmer, Michael Biehn, Lucy Punch and Michelle Trachtenberg were in the film.But unfortunately, the screenplay by Jackie and Jeff Filgo just fell flat on its face.  And it's a shame because the Filgo's know how to do comedy, unfortunately the execution of the comedy and the '80s storyline didn't seem right.  The film felt forced and it tried to go for quick laughs using Dan Fogler to fill in the role that is reminiscent of Jack Black and Jonah Hill.  A wannabe Apatow-like film for the late '80s.And while I'm up for that kind of humor...I was a bit disappointed about how this film turned out and I'm not alone as film critics also panned the film.For one thing, by the late '80s, none of us growing up in high school were listening to early '80s music.  Duran Duran, Dixie's Midnight Runners, Human League, The Buggles were replaced by the Guns n Roses, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, R.E.M., Debbie Gibson, UB40, INXS, George Michael, Expose, The Jets, Ton Loc, Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince,  Bobby Brown, New Kids on the Block and Whitney Houston.  The late 80's was a different beast...  Viewers grew up with MTV for music videos, '90s and people today grow up with MTV for reality TV.So, people have to realize that in the '80s, we were watching what was popular on MTV and in the late '80s, especially 1988, we were not listening to Duran Duran, Dexy's Midnight Runners, Human League, The Buggles...  By 1988, we were partying to Robert Palmer's ""Simply Irresistible"", UB40's ""Red Red Wine"", Beach Boys ""Kokomo"" or Bobby McFerrin's ""Don't Worry Be Happy"", INXS ""Need You Tonight"", George Michael's ""Faith"", Billy Ocean's ""Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car"" and yes, even that song ""Never Gonna Give You Up"", Rick Astley's popular song now for rickrolling.So, trying to emulate an '80s film from 1988 and have the music wrong is just bad!Second, to emulate an '80s film.  You need to have the look.  While music used was early '80s, I felt that the clothes were more early '90s.  Some parts such as hairstyle seemed right but the look and the feel of the characters were out of the element.And I know, younger people who did not grow up in the '80s, let alone the '90s, could care less about the music and everything is grouped together as part of the '80s.OK, so for now, I'll let the music and fashion slide and focus on the overall plot.  Can this film be any formulaic?  Guy meets girl he loved in high school, guy goes to party with girl, guy gets closer to girl and it all seems peachy keen for Topher Grace's character but I felt the story's subplot, involving Matt's sister, played by Anna Faris was thrown in to the story and the actress, was not well-utilized.  Dan Fogler was playing a similar role of the crazy and weird best friend but it seemed as if the writers were trying to come up with weird situations that were not funny at all.  And as much as I enjoy watching Teresa Palmer, I felt that I was watching this film for more Teresa Palmer and her beauty than her involvement in the film as an actress.As for the Blu-ray release, picture and audio quality were very good and you do get a digital copy of the film and as for the special features, you do get deleted scenes, a reunion of the cast (remember that this film was completed back in 2007 and shelved for a few years until its release in 2011), the music boom box for those interested in the music of the film and more.Overall, ""Take Me Home Tonight"" was OK.  The film's humor and its story just falls flat and the screenplay was too formulaic, predictable and not funny.  If you want a cool film about the underdog going after the girl, kids drinking and having fun, partying and characters that were well-utilized plus a film with an awesome soundtrack...check out the 1989 film ""Say Anything"" which is an awesome '80s film that gets it right!",3,"Blu-ray: Perhaps if they did more research on what people listened to in 1988, I would have enjoyed this film much more.",1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,11710,"['Filmmaker', 'Michael', 'Dowse', 'maybe', 'known', 'films', 'based', 'movie', 'beer', 'FUBAR', 'films', 'have', 'big', 'following', 'Canada', 'when', 'get',

Yea it's nothing new, but for all the flack the movie recieved it was quite enjoyable. It's reminesant of movies like License to Drive, a little of Sixteen Candles, a small fraction of John Cusak movies. What makes the movie shine from a very predictable script is Topher Grace. The rest of the cast is fine, the anchor of this movie is Topher as the ordinary guy in all of us. The guy that never truly stood out in high school that wanted the girl who felt was unreachable. The music is great. I feel that if you grew up watching movies from the 80's then you would enjoy it a bit more then one of those that grew up worshiping twilight or something worse then that from the 90's.",5,Gotta love the 80's,1311811200,"07 28, 2011",2011,799,"['was', 'surprised', 'movie', 'really', 'thought', 'going', 'movie', 'something', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'be', 'sub-par', 'Yea', 'nothing', 'new', 'flack', 'movie', 'recieved', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'reminesant', 'movies', 'License', 'Drive', 'little', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'small', 'fraction', 'John', 'Cusak', 'movies', 'What', 'movie', 'shine', 'very', 'predictable', 'script', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'rest', 'cast', 'fine', 'anchor', 'movie', 'Topher', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'guy', 'never', 'truly', 'stood', 'out', 'high', 'school', 'wanted', 'girl', 'who', 'felt', 'was', 'unreachable', 'music', 'great', 'feel', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'movies', '80', 'then', 'would', 'enjoy', 'bit', 'more', 'then', 'one', 'grew', 'up', 'worshiping', 'twilight', 'something', 'worse', 'then', '90']",N/A
1436960,A2F7PEA3G37YDT,B0051MKN5O,dylan21484nj,"[6, 9]","Topher Grace plays Matt Franklin, an MIT grad aimlessly mulling about in his Suncoast Video job while life passes him by. But when his high school crush Tori Frederking (Teresa Palmer) walks in and invites Matt to a Labor Day '88 house party, Matt sets out to win his dream girl on the wildest night of his life in ""Take Me Home Tonight.""The film, while enjoyable, hits just about every note an 80's comedy is expected to have. The only problem? It's 2011. So even though Take Me Home Tonight's intention is to pay loving homage to the raunchy comedies of the 80's, that also means that every awkward moment, every lie coming undone, every plot twist and turn is seen coming ten miles away because we've seen it in countless films before. You know Matt's lie about working at Goldman Sachs is going to blow up in his face and ruin everything right after he wins Tori over. And you know he's going to do whatever it takes to get her back. You know Matt's wacky buddy Barry (Balls of Fury's Dan Fogler) is going to incite lots of madness and mayhem like stealing cars, snorting coke, and getting into dance-offs with your typical 80's pop-and-locker while badly mimicking Michael Jackson's moves. You even know the giant steel ball seen early on in the film is going to factor into the film's finale, and that Matt will be the one brave/stupid enough to ride it through the California hills.All the 80's staples are here - the music (one-hit wonders like ""Come on Eileen"" and ""Safety Dance"", but the song the film gets its title from never appears at any point during the film, oddly enough), the dance moves, the clothing, the moussed-up hairstyles and the perms, it's all here. However, it all does feel a little ""on the nose"" and overdone, as if the writers are desperately saying to the audience, ""Hey! It's the 80's! Remember the red leather jackets? The casual drug use? The kitschy music? Remember?!?""As cliche as the film is, the principles are all likeable. Matt Franklin might as well be Grace's Eric Foreman character from That 70's Show. Heck, their names even sound alike. I believe this film was written by Grace and the writers from That 70's Show, who seem to dabble in period-piece comedies (which means we may have them to ""thank"" for the short-lived, terrible show That 80's Show.) So it would come as no shock if Grace's next film involved a similar character in a 90's setting as well. Even so, Grace gets by on his self-deprecating everyman charm. Fogler brings his ""wacky sidekick on coke"" role the energy it needs. Palmer, a blonde doppleganger for Twilight's Kristen Stewart, definitely brings the hotness to the dreamgirl role. Dmitri Martin and Michael Ian Black both make fun cameos, and Michael Biehn, famous for playing Kyle Reese in the 80's staple film The Terminator, plays Matt's dad. The only role that really disappoints is Anna Faris, who plays Matt's sister. Her role is very much subdued, which is disappointing considering her obvious comedic talents in films like The House Bunny and the Scary Movie series. She pretty much spends the movie torn between life as her dim boyfriend's future wife and her potential enrollment as a grad student at Cambridge, and thus doesn't add much to the film's comedic elements.""Take Me Home Tonight"" is still a fun film, despite its paint-by-numbers plot and 80's overkill. The film's biggest success derives from the likeability of its cast of characters, particularly in Topher Grace's awkward-guy charm.",3,"A good, likeable comedy, but all too predictable",1311379200,"07 23, 2011",2011,3480,"['Grace', 'Matt', 'Franklin', 'MIT', 'grad', 'aimlessly', 'mulling', 'Suncoast', 'Video', 'job', 'life', 'passes', 'when', 'high', 'school', 'crush', 'Tori', 'Frederking', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'walks', 'invites', 'Matt', 'Labor', 'Day', ""'88"", 'house', 'party', 'Matt', 'out', 'win', 'dream', 'girl', 'wildest', 'night', 'life', 'Take', 'Me', 'Home', 'Tonight', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'note', '80', 'comedy', 'expected', 'have', 'only', 'problem', '2011', 'So', 'even', 'Take', 'Me', 'Home', 'Tonight', 'intention', 'pay', 'loving', 'homage', 'raunchy', 'comedies', '80', 'also', 'awkward', 'moment', 'lie', 'coming', 'undone', 'plot', 'twist', 'turn', 'seen', 'coming', 'ten', 'miles', 'away', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'films', 'know', 'Matt', 'lie', 'working', 'Goldman', 'Sachs', 'going', 'blow', 'up', 'face', 'ruin', 'everything', 'right', 'Tori', 'know', 'going', 'do', 'whatever', 'get', 'back', 'know', 'Matt', 'wacky', 'buddy', 'Barry', 'Balls', 'Fury', 'Dan', 'Fogler', 'going', 'incite', 'lots', 'madness', 'mayhem', 'stealing', 'cars', 'snorting', 'coke', 'getting', 'dance-offs', 'typical', '80', 'pop-and-locker', 'badly', 'mimicking', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'moves', 'even', 'know', 'giant', 'steel', 'ball', 'seen', 'early', 'film', 'going', 'factor', 'film', 'finale', 'Matt', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'brave/stupid', 'enough', 'ride', 'California', 'hills.All', '80', 'staples', 'are', 'here', 'music', 'one-hit', 'wonders', 'Come', 'Eileen', 'Safety', 'Dance', 'song', 'film', 'title', 'never', 'point', 'film', 'oddly', 'enough', 'dance', 'moves', 'clothing', 'moussed-up', 'hairstyles', 'perms', 'here', 'However', 'feel', 'little', 'nose', 'overdone', 'writers', 'are', 'desperately', 'saying', 'audience', 'Hey', '80', 'Remember', 'red', 'leather', 'jackets', 'casual', 'drug', 'use', 'kitschy', 'music', 'Remember', 'As', 'cliche', 'film', 'principles', 'are', 'likeable', 'Matt', 'Franklin', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'Grace', 'Eric', 'Foreman', 'character', '70', 'Show', 'Heck', 'names', 'even', 'sound', 'alike', 'believe', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'Grace', 'writers', '70', 'Show', 'who', 'seem', 'dabble', 'period-piece', 'comedies', 'may', 'have', 'thank', 'short-lived', 'terrible', 'show', '80', 'Show', 'would', 'come', 'shock', 'Grace', 'next', 'film', 'involved', 'similar', 'character', '90', 'setting', 'as', 'well', 'Even', 'so', 'Grace', 'self-deprecating', 'everyman', 'charm', 'Fogler', 'wacky', 'sidekick', 'coke', 'role', 'energy', 'Palmer', 'blonde', 'doppleganger', 'Twilight', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'definitely', 'hotness', 'dreamgirl', 'role', 'Dmitri', 'Martin', 'Michael', 'Ian', 'Black', 'make', 'fun', 'cameos', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'famous', 'playing', 'Kyle', 'Reese', '80', 'staple', 'film', 'Terminator', 'Matt', 'dad', 'only', 'role', 'really', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'who', 'Matt', 'sister', 'role', 'very', 'much', 'subdued', 'disappointing', 'considering', 'obvious', 'comedic', 'talents', 'films', 'House', 'Bunny', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'series', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'torn', 'life', 'dim', 'boyfriend', 'future', 'wife', 'potential', 'enrollment', 'grad', 'student', 'Cambridge', 'thus', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'film', 'comedic', 'elements', 'Take', 'Me', 'Home', 'Tonight', 'still', 'fun', 'film', 'paint-by-numbers', 'plot', '80', 'overkill', 'film', 'biggest', 'success', 'derives', 'likeability', 'cast', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'awkward-guy', 'charm']",N/A

You like these people so you do find yourself caring how things turn out for them.Here's the scoop. Topher Grace has a recent engineering degree from MIT but works at Suncoast Video because he doesn't know what to do with his life. His twin sister (played by Anna Faris) has applied to Cambridge for a Masters degree in writing but is not sure if she wants to go because of her relationship with her boyfriend. Topher's friend Barry just lost his job as a car salesman. Topher runs into an old high school crush and they all end up at a party that evening. Can they all work through their difficulties?This is a fun movie. It has its share of laughs, and certain things are set up early on that will need to be resolved by the end. It's all very 'by the book.' in that regard. Had this been cast differently it probably wouldn't have been as good. Anna Faris is a real sweetie. She just has a good way about her. Topher, with his work in TV, is well seasoned. He's growing into himself and is taking on more the air of an adult. Dan Fogler, as Barry, did a good job when he wasn't doing his Sam Kinison interpretation. Everyone else did a standup job which is why this worked as well as it did. Putting Trevor Horn in charge of the soundtrack was way smart. This has the better songs from that period. The ""dance-off"" scene is set to ""The Safety Dance"" and it's a real hoot.This is a good time. It's enjoyable and won't strain your brain cells. Just sit back and know it won't change your life.

It's not billed as such, and doesn't claim to be a remake, but there is far too much similarity to say otherwise.  The previous version is superior in every single way, but this movie is nonetheless a fun jaunt through the 80s, with one of the best nostalgic soundtracks in cinema history.Unlike Ethan Embry who made the role realistic, Topher Grace plays a far too refined, far too good looking guy (Matt) who just graduated from MIT yet remembers the High School days of not having luck with the ladies.  This is unlikely.  Nonetheless, he's got an MIT-certified license to demand money, and he's living with his parents while working at a video store.  It just feels like they're trying too hard to make him unsuccessful.  His world flips upside down when his High School crush - Tori (Teresa Palmer) - walks in and invites him to a party.  Palmer is very pretty, but an obvious downgrade from Jennifer Love Hewitt in CHW.  Anyway, the quest is on.  Matt, along with his comedic sidekick Barry (Dan Fogler) and unessential to the script sister (Anna Farris, post ducklip plastic surgery), will make the most of his opportunities, take the chances, chase the girl, and basically do everything he didn't do while in High School.Somewhere in there are lessons about responsibility, telling the truth, and carpe diem, but they're far too jumbled and convoluted (i.e. girl gives guy a chance because guy lies, girl is upset about lies later but admits without lies he had no chance) to glean.

The music was wonderful, and the opening credits were imaginative. But the plot was extremely weak - smart kid works at a video store post-graduation, wants impress his high-school crush at a big Labor Day party. Aside from our main character and the girl he's after, there's the main character's twin sister, who is torn between settling down with her dopey boyfriend (who is also the one hosting the party) or pursuing her dreams as a writer, and the main character's friend, who loses his job at a car shop and retaliates by stealing one of their best cars. The friend is pretty much intoxicated the entire movie, alternating between doing coke and drinking, or chatting with a goth chick at the party.The problem is you just don't really care about the characters. We aren't given a lot of backstory, and about 20 minutes in they're already all at the party. The main character lies a lot to his crush in order to get her to like him, and you know he's going to get burned for it. The plot is predictable, and not really that funny. (And rather unbelievable. I absolutely hated the scene with the cops. It was so over the top and ended ridiculously, and not in a humorous way.) I enjoyed the music, and there was a lot of it. It seemed every few minutes was a music montage. But overall there was nothing solid that tied the whole thing together.

1436973,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0051MKN5O,Mark Turner,"[2, 4]","It's always a pleasure to be surprised by a movie. You get word that the new big hit is making its way to DVD and watch it to find it so so but then pick up another new release to round out the night and find yourself pleasantly surprised. Such was the case this week with TAKE ME HOME TONIGHT.Set in the late 80s, Matt Franklin (Topher Grace) is in a rut. He was the smartest kid in school, has his degree from MIT and yet is working at Suncoast Video, still dreaming of the lost love of his life, the girl that he never had the courage to ask out, Tori Frederking (Teresa Palmer). Who should walk into the store but Tori. Matt quickly ducks out the back, ditches his uniform and casually strikes up a conversation with Tori and the knowledge that she's going to be at the big part his sister's boyfriend is putting on that night.Matt's twin sister Wendy (Anna Faris) and best friend Barry (Dan Fogler) have heard it all before. The same story over and over as Matt continues to wait for the exact right moment to talk to Tori. This could be it but they doubt it.The same day of the part Barry loses his job. With revenge in mind, and in an attempt to help make Matt look the part of a Goldman Sachs employee (what he told Tori he was doing so she'd be impressed), they steal a showroom car. They also find that the owner has stashed his cocaine in the glove compartment, something that will turn Barry into a wild man as the evening wears on.At the party Matt comes face to face with an old nemesis and his sister's boyfriend Kyle (Chris Pratt). The stereotypical jerk with money character seen in so many 80s films, Kyle pops the question that night to Wendy which leads to a rift between siblings. Matt knows her desire is to go to Cambridge and she might have been accepted. No way will Kyle let her do such a thing.As the night moves forward, Matt comes to Tori's rescue when she's being hit on by someone she can't stand. The two spend some time together and seem to be hitting it off. Matt, Barry, Tori and her friends head out to another party in Beverly Hills her boss is hosting. When he tries to embarrass Matt, Matt comes off as knowing more than he really does and puts him in his place, giving him and edge with Tori. But will it be enough for him to make it last? Will she accept him for what he really is? Will she even find out? Will Barry make it through the night alive? And what about Wendy and Kyle?All of these questions are answered before the end of the film. And it's all done in such a style that you would think this was just another John Hughes film from the 80s. The look and feel of the film, the situations that the characters find themselves in and the whole vibe of the 80s, along with a soundtrack that will have you saying ""Hey I remember that song!"" out loud come together for one funny and touching comedy.Topher Grace will forever be associated with the character of Eric Foreman from the TV series THAT 70'S SHOW. But it's nice to see that while the character here has touches of Eric it is in no way a duplicate. Matt is a nice guy, someone who just hasn't found out what he wants to do with his life yet. He just knows that he never took that chance, made that move to discover if the dream he always had could become a reality. Towards the end it's his father (played by Michael Biehn) who tells him he just needs to take a shot at something. Words to live by.The supporting cast does a great job as well. Fogler seems to be the new Curtis Armstrong in films these days, another reference to 80's films. Faris is turning out to be quite the actress, displaying more emotional depth than she's had in the past. And Teresa Palmer is a fresh face that has the chops to carry off her character with ease.As I said at the start this movie is reminiscent of so many films from the 80's, the screwball romantic comedies of the time. Memories of THE BREAKFAST CLUB, SIXTEEN CANDLES, SAY ANYTHING and more will be sure to pop into your head while you watch this movie. And not in a condescending way or rip off of those films. It's a fresh look at those movies done now, a tribute of sorts but a story in its own right. This one offers entertainment, laughs and a nice romance as well.

When the girl that Matt (Grace) has had a crush on since high school comes in to the video store where he works he decides its finally his chance to make a move.  Matt's best friend and sister decide to help him in any way they can.  I enjoyed this, but it wasn't what I expected.  Judging by the preview for this I was expecting more of a straight comedy, while this had funny moments, it was a little more dramatic then I expected.  This movie was set in the 80's, and I think that was to add a little something different to the over done plot, since the 80's aspect was not really discussed at all.  This movie had the feel of a John Hughes movie, and was very fun to watch.  Not really anything new, but Topher Grace and Anna Faris are a good pick for brother and sister, and the guy who plays Matt's best friend is really funny and over the top in this.  Overall, a really good movie that is fun to watch, but the type of movie that has been done over and over, not usually as good as this one though.  I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - I might.*Also Try - Sixteen Candles",4,A very good movie that is a close as you can get to a John Hughes movie with out actually being one.

Its like they were given a soundtrack to make a movie to. This film will be the black mark on Topher Grace's career! Any movie Dan Fogler is in SUCKS! Look at FANBOYS!Fanboys [Blu-ray] Also this is probably the worst acting I've ever seen out of Anna Ferris. I think this should have been a direct to disk movie and then burned by anyone with taste. The soundtrack sucks! I love 80s music but I wouldn't have picked these bands to play even a country fair.,1,WORST MOVIE EVER!!!

1436997,AP3B615GM191G,B0051MKN5O,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 2]","The main plotline of ""Take Me Home Tonight"" is one that should be compelling: college-grad loser decides to finally come out of his shell and enter the ""real world"".  However, there are so many poor elements embedded in this movie that it completely overshadows what could have been a decent story.For a basic plot summary, this film sees Matt Franklin (Topher Grace), a mathematical genius, wasting away his post-college life working at an outlet video rental store and never venturing much further out than that.  When his old high school crush Tori Frederking (Teresa Palmer) shows up, however, Matt decides to throw caution to the wind for one night to impress her.There are two main problems with this movie: First, it is billed as a nostalgic comedy, but lives up to neither term.  It was beaten to the ""80s memories"" punch by ""Hot Tub Time Machine"", and is utterly lacking in humor (I laughed twice the entire showing).  So, the entire premise for the film fails miserably.Can the acting save the day?  Nope.  Grace & Palmer are serviceable as the leads, but their characters are so ridiculous that it doesn't give them much room to act.  Then, Anna Ferris is given the most shallow role of the whole film.  It was almost as if the writers were shocked to have her name in the film, but then didn't know what to do with her.  Whenever (at the brief moments) that this film actually makes you care, Ferris' plotline drags it right back down again.Thus, I cannot recommend ""Take Me Home Tonight"" to any audiences.  If you want some good 80s-nostalgia belly laughs, turn to ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" instead.
