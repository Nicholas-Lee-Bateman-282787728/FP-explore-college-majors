1595291,A184A7TYY9SKX,B009DA74ES,Jacktavish,"[4, 5]","I think all fans can agree that Season 1 & 2 of Californication are by far the best. There was something more thanjust sex & drunken debauchery. Like character development & intelligence lurking beneath stupid actions.Season 3 was the nadir. The absurd school teacher plotline of Hank's affairs w/ stripper student, TA, & head of college all at the same time was idiotic. Then Rick Springfield & Kathleen Turner really made things worse. Season 4 was a bit better, & now Season 5 is about the same as 4. Except the sparkle is gone. The 2 - 3 years Hank was supposedly back in NYC are skipped over completely (& that might have added some fresh ideas). Instead, he goes right back to LA where everything is pretty much the same. This time-jump is handled in a sloppy manner, as if the producers just don't care.How many more times do we have to see Charlie Runkle walk around bare-ass naked, or jerking-off to porn? How many times do we have to see him having sex w/ ridiculously beautiful women half his age? He would have to be a major movie director to pull that off, not just an agent w/ a nice house. Tom Kapinos has gotten into a rut like Judd Apatov with catch-phrases. The first time you hear ""man-gina"" it's kind of funny, but the 10th time, not so much. Rapper ""Samurai"" doesn't add much to the proceedings beyond a vague, stupid plot-device about Hank writing his ""Santa Monica Cop"" movie. Amazingly, it's actually a relief when Rob Lowe's character reappears toward end of the season. Marcy's marriage to Hollywood producer is boring, un-funny & sometimes just gross to observe...I still watched the season because the Hank Moody character is still a funny screw-up. But you can predict everything, like the annual flashback episode to when they first moved to LA (but look exactly the same age).I hope they end this series really soon, so we can remember the great writing, verbal jabs (& sex & debauchery) from the first two seasons. Maybe Hank could die having sex & then they give him a Viking funeral.

1595293,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B009DA74ES,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[12, 19]","CALIFORNICATION, for me, was initially a show about a bitter, desperate and damaged artist looking to regain his muse and the child they share whilst he made increasingly poor decisions in regards to sex, drugs and his career. Hank Moody felt like a true American original, or at least an original in terms of what American society has bred; a frustrated writer with one hit book turned into an abysmal Hollywood rom-com whose Peter Pan complex regarding women, sex, booze, drugs and generally irresponsible behavior is just barely trumped by his fairy-tale love for his beautiful and almost impossibly cool ""baby mama"" and their cherubic, wise-beyond-her-years daughter. The conceit of the show essentially is how he keeps trying against his nature to be a decent guy, a good father and a responsible human being, and that gives us a great and unique character with a lot of internal struggle going on. It also doesn't hurt that the show has a pretty astounding cast, with David Duchovny firmly holding the show together with his mix of humor, melancholy, and seductiveness. Each season has dealt with a new facet of Hank's continuing out-of-control spiral and how he either gets back in the good graces of his great love and his daughter, or loses even more control of the situation.But with Season Five, the show seems to be running on auto-pilot as it continues to put Hank in increasingly absurd situations with new groups of people that will eventually be an outlet for his creativity and his sexual thirst.This season shows the return of Hank back to Los Angeles after slightly over a two-year return back to New York as he begins to work in a psuedo-hack capacity as a writer for a lame action-comedy under the control of rapper-turned-actor Samurai Apocalypse (The RZA). Returning for action as well is Hank's muse Karen (Natascha McElhone), their daughter Becca (Madeline Martin), his agent/best friend Charlie Runkle (Evan Handler), Charlie's ex-wife Marcy (Pamela Adlon), and her new husband and movie producer Stu (the awesome Stephen Tobolowsky). Karen has gotten married to novelist Richard Bates (Jason Beghe) in this hiatus, Becca has started college and is dating a slightly older grad student and hipster tool Tyler (Scott Michael Foster), and Marcy has given birth to Charlie's baby. On the flight from NY to LA, Hank meets the beautiful Kali (Meagan Good) and there is that instant attraction that leads to something slightly physical on the flight. It is, naturally, later that Hank finds out that Kali is the girlfriend of the extraordinarily jealous Samurai Apocalypse. Then the situation becomes increasingly more insane as seemingly divergent roads all head on a collision course toward one another. Cop ride-alongs, falling off the wagon, professional discourtesy, rap culture posturing, the never-ending parade of women and the never-ending pummelling of Hank from his loved ones as they call out all of his flaws and as he continues to create situations he cannot extricate himself from.Hank Moody is clearly a man who is less in love with the woman of his dreams and more in love with his charming, roguish, devil-may-care attitude about life and responsibility. He keeps trying to live up to the standards that others have set for him to be something more than he is, but it just seems to be more that what he truly wants. Aside from his obvious concern for Becca, Hank is a pretty unlikable but still strangely admirable human being; he's a being driven purely by the moment. He has no respect for the past and no regard for the future, and this is one of the reasons that I love this show. Having your main character be kind of repellant, despite his obvious charm, is a great idea to build an edgy post-modern comedy around, and the first few seasons were rife with dark and compelling moments for Hank that were very bracing and fascinatingly cruel. With this season, though, they literally seem to have run out of ways to tell that story, so the focus seems to be making Hank more likable and having his flaws seem more cute than compelling. The show therefore suffers because by making Hank a more likeable character, they lose part of the purpose of the show; to challenge you to like a very unlikable man and want to follow him on his adventures through the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles and the entertainment business.Of course, the season still has some really strong comedic moments. Hank's quips are still razor-sharp, Charlie (with the help of Handler's giant infant visage) is the perpetual Charlie Brown of this show as he continually makes one poor decision after another, and Stu, as handled by Tobolowsky, is a joy to watch as the single greatest character actor schlub gets to play against type as a true power-player and a man of legendary endowment.Sadly, it's the women who suffer the most in this season. Karen is the hot-and-cold-running ex who seems to be still very much in love with Hank one moment and then utterly repulsed by him the next. Becca similarly has the many of those character beats, but with slightly more gravitas, because Madeline Martin plays her so well. Marcy is so incredibly irritating in this season with her constant ascerbic commentary and seemingly no real concern for her child, which is a shame because Adlon is such a terrific performer. Meghan Good is fine as Kali, but doesn't get much time to shine here. The two women that make the biggest impact this season are guest stars Drea De Matteo as a stripper with little-to-no impulse control and Natalie Zea as Hank's psychotic ex.This brings me to something else that has been kind of an issue from the beginning which is the arguable casual misogyny that takes place in this show. Los Angeles is either populated by literal or figurative whores; women who will do just about anything with anyone at any time. It's more likely that this is an unintentional result of the way that creator/showrunner Tom Kapinos wishes to tell Hank's story as well as presenting Los Angeles as a modern-day Sodom and Gommorah where debauchery runs rampant, but it seems much more evident in this season since none of the female characters seem to have any real confidence, power or control over their lives, unless it's sexual politics, and this is pretty troubling. Even though we're essentially done with the character of Mia, at least she had an interesting arc.I guess the real question is if I disliked this season as much as I apparently do, why do I still give it an above-average rating? As a man, there's something about this show that still appeals to the adolescent in me, and I don't know if it's the constant cavalcade of casual nudity, filthy jokes, or wish-fulfillment fantasy, but it's something, and I still think that Hank Moody is a very special character, and I'm hoping that this next season will be more about character and less about events, because Season Five of CALIFORNICATION, while still somewhat appealing, is certainly its weakest.",3,The Man-Child Defense Continues.,1353196800,"11 18, 2012",2012,6983,"['CALIFORNICATION', 'was', 'initially', 'show',
