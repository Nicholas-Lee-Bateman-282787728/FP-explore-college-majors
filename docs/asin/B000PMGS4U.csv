1072582,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000PMGS4U,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[13, 14]","Two young innocents, struggling musican Rohit and rich but good natured Sonia, meet and are attracted to each other. Somehow, they end up on a deserted island and, there, they declare their love. Sonia's father rescues them, but he's got his hate on for Rohit and vindictively causes him to be fired from his job. Rohit vows to make his way up in the world and be on equal terms with Sonia's social standing. Only then will he seek to marry Sonia. But some things aren't meant to be, and, soon, Sonia learns of Rohit's abrupt and shocking drowning.Her concerned father sends the disconsolate Sonia to gorgeous New Zealand to forget Rohit and to recuperate. Now here comes that Bollywood twist as, instead, she bumps into Raj, someone who looks amazingly like her dead love. Raj falls for Sonia, but she doesn't reciprocate as the sight of him only recalls painful memories of her Rohit. She flees back to India. Raj follows and, in the course of the film, unearths the reason behind Rohit's passing. Now can he win the girl of his dreams? Also, there's some crooked cops.KAHO NAA...PYAAR HAI is a 2000 blockbuster Bollywood film which first introduced Hrithik Roshan to the world and made him an overnight success. I guess Hrithik's dad, Rakesh Roshan, who directed this flick, knew what he was doing. KAHO NAA...PYAAR HAI won a boatload of Indian Cinema awards, including best actor wins for Hrithik Roshan. Owing to the huge popularity of the film, debuting actress Amisha Patel, who looks like sweetness and light personified, also became, to a lesser extent, an instant ""hot"" commodity. But, certainly, she owes some of her fame to the ""Hrithik factor."" This is an instance where sheer charisma and star power colossally loom over normally more consequential things such as plot and script. Certainly, without the two leads (and specifically Hrithik), the movie wouldn't be all that and a bag of chips. As it is, it's box office bonanza.The first half of the film indulges in some pretty sappy romantic fluff, which might be terrific for girls but, c'mon, I'm a dude who hopes to grow hair on his chest one day (because you shouldn't give up on your dreams). But I was this close to tossing this one out when, suddenly, the movie became interesting. That would be after an hour and a half, when the scenery changes to New Zealand and the story gains serious momentum as the oh-so-gentle love story turns into a gripping crime drama and chase film.So, exciting action for the guys. For the girls, a leading man with flashing green eyes, a muscular physique (Bollywood star Salman Khan oversaw his weight training), explosive dancing skills, and one other thing. Boyfriends and male buddies of the female audience might end up loathing this dude (I know I did), but one can't really deny that the man can actually deliver his lines and effectively perform in his dual roles. Amisha Patel, cute and lovable as she is, is still overshadowed by Hrithik.KAHO NAA...PYAAR HAI is almost three hours long, which gives the movie ample time to plug Coca Cola (could the film sell out even more?). The songs are mostly fun and are, in turns, wistful and hopeful and romantic. When Raj strums the guitar to the strains of Rohit's song, there's a certain recognition there felt by the audience and certainly felt by Sonia. Meanwhile, Hrithik's smooth dancing in the musical numbers is probably what cemented his popularity with the swooning girldom. There's humor throughout the film, but the only two scenes which made me laugh out loud involved a boy with a mustache and Indian comedian Johnny Lever as a policeman caught in the grips of a bathroom dilemma. Poor fella.Question: is it just me or did Raj recover awfully quickly from his shoulder wound? And, finally, as I was watching the final stages of this film, the cynical side of me couldn't help but wonder how perfectly twisted and cold it'd be if Raj also dies. Now that'd be something. Anyway, as debuts go, Hrithik Roshan and Amisha Patel do fairly well. In fact, going by the Indian movie goers and the critics' overwhelmingly positive reception toward the film, they do exceedingly well. Ergo, three and a half shot at, flung over a bridge, and drowned stars.",4,One day she'll shake his hand - and that'll be the start,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,4214,"['Two', 'young', 'innocents', 'struggling', 'musican', 'Rohit', 'rich', 'good', 'natured', 'Sonia', 'meet', 'are', 'attracted', 'other', 'Somehow', 'end', 'up', 'deserted', 'island', 'declare', 'love', 'Sonia', 'father', 'got', 'hate', 'Rohit', 'vindictively', 'be', 'fired', 'job', 'Rohit', 'make', 'way', 'up', 'world', 'be', 'equal', 'terms', 'Sonia', 'social', 'standing', 'Only', 'then', 'will', 'seek', 'marry', 'Sonia', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'soon', 'Sonia', 'Rohit', 'abrupt', 'shocking', 'drowning.Her', 'concerned', 'father', 'disconsolate', 'Sonia', 'gorgeous', 'New', 'Zealand', 'forget', 'Rohit', 'recuperate', 'Now', 'here', 'Bollywood', 'twist', 'instead', 'bumps', 'Raj', 'someone', 'who', 'amazingly', 'dead', 'love', 'Raj', 'Sonia', ""n't"", 'reciprocate', 'sight', 'only', 'painful', 'memories', 'Rohit', 'back', 'India', 'Raj', 'course', 'film', 'reason', 'Rohit', 'passing', 'Now', 'can', 'win', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Also', 'crooked', 'cops.KAHO', 'NAA', 'PYAAR', 'HAI', '2000', 'blockbuster', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'first', 'introduced', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'world', 'made', 'overnight', 'success', 'guess', 'Hrithik', 'dad', 'Rakesh', 'Roshan', 'who', 'directed', 'flick', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'KAHO', 'NAA', 'PYAAR', 'HAI', 'won', 'boatload', 'Indian', 'Cinema', 'awards', 'including', 'best', 'actor', 'wins', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'Owing', 'huge', 'popularity', 'film', 'debuting', 'actress', 'Amisha', 'Patel', 'who', 'sweetness', 'light', 'personified', 'also', 'became', 'lesser', 'extent', 'instant', 'hot', 'commodity', 'certainly', 'fame', 'Hrithik', 'factor', 'instance', 'where', 'sheer', 'charisma', 'star', 'power', 'colossally', 'normally', 'more', 'consequential', 'things', 'such', 'plot', 'script', 'Certainly', 'two', 'leads', 'specifically', 'Hrithik', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bag', 'chips', 'box', 'office', 'bonanza.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'indulges', 'pretty', 'sappy', 'romantic', 'fluff', 'might', 'be', 'terrific', 'girls', ""c'mon"", ""'m"", 'dude', 'who', 'grow', 'hair', 'chest', 'one', 'day', 'should', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'dreams', 'was', 'close', 'tossing', 'one', 'out', 'when', 'suddenly', 'movie', 'became', 'interesting', 'would', 'be', 'hour', 'half', 'when', 'scenery', 'changes', 'New', 'Zealand', 'story', 'gains', 'serious', 'momentum', 'oh-so-gentle', 'love', 'story', 'gripping', 'crime', 'drama', 'chase', 'film.So', 'exciting', 'action', 'guys', 'girls', 'leading', 'man', 'flashing', 'green', 'eyes', 'muscular', 'physique', 'Bollywood', 'star', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'oversaw', 'weight', 'training', 'explosive', 'dancing', 'skills', 'one', 'other', 'thing', 'Boyfriends', 'male', 'buddies', 'female', 'audience', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'loathing', 'dude', 'know', 'did', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'deny', 'man', 'can', 'actually', 'deliver', 'lines', 'effectively', 'perform', 'dual', 'roles', 'Amisha', 'Patel', 'cute', 'lovable', 'still', 'overshadowed', 'Hrithik.KAHO', 'NAA', 'PYAAR', 'HAI', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'movie', 'ample', 'time', 'plug', 'Coca', 'Cola', 'could', 'film', 'sell', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'songs', 'are', 'mostly', 'fun', 'are', 'turns', 'wistful', 'hopeful', 'romantic', 'When', 'Raj', 'strums', 'guitar', 'strains', 'Rohit', 'song', 'certain', 'recognition', 'felt', 'audience', 'certainly', 'felt', 'Sonia', 'Meanwhile', 'Hrithik', 'smooth', 'dancing', 'musical', 'numbers', 'probably', 'what', 'cemented', 'popularity', 'swooning', 'girldom', 'humor', 'film', 'only', 'two', 'scenes', 'made', 'loud', 'involved', 'boy', 'mustache', 'Indian', 'comedian', 'Johnny', 'Lever', 'policeman', 'caught', 'grips', 'bathroom', 'dilemma', 'Poor', 'fella.Question', 'just', 'did', 'Raj', 'recover', 'awfully', 'quickly', 'shoulder', 'wound', 'finally', 'was', 'watching', 'final', 'stages', 'film', 'cynical', 'side', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'perfectly', 'twisted', 'cold', ""'d"", 'be', 'Raj', 'also', 'Now', ""'d"", 'be', 'something', 'Anyway', 'debuts', 'go', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'Amisha', 'Patel', 'do', 'fairly', 'well', 'fact', 'going', 'Indian', 'movie', 'goers', 'critics', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'reception', 'film', 'do', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'Ergo', 'three', 'half', 'shot', 'flung', 'bridge', 'drowned', 'stars']",N/A

He is very talented in his dancing and acting. This movie has it all drama,crime drama,romance,and I love the action scenes. Yes they could be cheesy at times but how exciting. I think he should do a action series of movies. Like the Bourne movies only Bollywood style of course. The only thing I didn't like was the scene in which he was beating the stuffing out of the bad guys and the girl starts yelling at him to kill them, kill them. It was one thing for him to kill them because he was fighting for his life (which he was) but another to kill just to kill. Of course this is a movie and I loved it.

1072587,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B000PMGS4U,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[3, 5]","What an interesting story of mistaken identity and and then taking action to go after those who killed the guy who looks like you.  This movie was filmed in India and New Zealand so you know you're gonna get a great visual treat if anything else.  Plus look at these two very popular absolute gorgeous actors: Hrithik Roshan and Amisha Patel.  I have alot of Bollywood films on DVD, and this is one of those DVD's that I watch at least once a year.  For a nearly three hour movie, it never seems to drag.  Entertaining all the way through.But, I generally watch Bollywood films because I love to watch good looking people on film.  A good story is only secondary as my intention to be entertained.If you an English speaking American, and are new to Bollywood films, let me give you a breakdown of how I interpret and ingest the Bollywood experience:First of all, you will most always be reading English subtitles.The average Bollywood film is about 3 hours long.Bollywood films are very colorful.  All their beautiful fashion, and colorful dance floors. In High Definition, just the sceneries alone make you appreciate what High Definition is all about.About 30 percent of the film will be music videos (with Yash Raj films, it's more like about 45 percent). I personally wish there were less music videos if the movie is already over three hours long.About 30 percent of most Bollywood films have some rather silly, really unfunny, and downright annoying comedy scenes (which is usually in the first half of the film), then the film will start to become more serious, as it moves along.One of the main reasons why you will watch a Bollywood film, is because you already chose to fall in love with one of their many beautiful actresses, or handsome actors. (I personally try to see all Rani Mukherji films, and Shah Rukh Khan is the one actor known to be one of the biggest box office sellers of Bollywood.)So, I guess I can honestly say that I have about 10 Blu-Ray Bollywood films which about 7 of them are Yash Raj releases. Though I have about 100 Bollywood films on DVD, all I really care to get on Blu-Ray now is ""Lagaan"" which was the first Bollywood film that I saw about 10 years ago.  And perhaps ""Mann"" with Aamir Khan, and ""Rangeela"" which stars the enchanting Urmila Matondkar.  Oh, and I guess it would be truly appreciated if ""Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai"" starring Amisha Patel and Hrithik Roshan would ever be released in High Definition Blu-Ray.  The scenes in India and New Zealand were all just so beautiful on the screen.Another good movie that I would like to recommend, that is not a Yash Raj film, but is available on Blu-Ray is ""Ghulam"" starring Rani Mukherji and Aamir Khan.  Even all the song videos in this film are all truly appreciated, and the added humor isn't so annoying.

1072590,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,B000PMGS4U,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[4, 5]","Well here, I am with a review for my second Bollywood purchase!  In case anyone finds the title of this review weird, it is a reference to Paul Newman's screen debut in a movie of the same name. I will explain how it fits, please be patient with me. Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai put Hrithik Roshan on the map and started the ""Hrithik Effect"" this phenomenon bumped up tourism for New Zealand, caused riots, and suddenly made a lot of big stars start hitting the gym! Not bad for a guy who had a stammer as a child and then told he would never dance well enough to be a hero in Bollywood films.In order to enjoy this film you need to be a sap, and have a keen sense of appreciation for the ridiculous. Fortunately, I have both in spades. I am a big believer that in order to enjoy movies you have to accept them for what they are. This movie is not a life changing experience. It does not make you think about any grand question of life, it does not provoke, shock, or make any kid of statement. Its purpose is to give you almost three hours of escapism, mushy romance, and a few giggles. Most of all, it is supposed to make you go nuts for the Leading Man. It did that for me, so I give it four stars; but I am not going to lie, this is hardly a masterpiece of Hindi Cinema.I am a bit of a geek when it comes to movies I love the whole process. So, things like the production, the direction, the cinematography, are important to me. This is my first Rakesh Roshan film and I have to say there were things that kept nagging at me. The way he shot the film felt odd, I realize that is a vague statement but its true. He captured the gorgeous locations with beautiful sweeping shots, yet the close-ups were shot so tightly that they felt stifling rather than intimate. The action shots were appropriately nerve wracking, but the sound effects people really dropped the ball. I mean I just saw Yash Chopra's Vijay, on Netflix and I find it baffling that the same sound techniques were used in the year 2000 for the fight scenes in this film. In those areas, I have to admit to disappointment.In the spirit of honesty, I will also admit that Sonia, played by Ameesha Patel does very little for me. Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan had originally been offered the role, and Kareena Kapoor-Kahn, had been signed at first, but she walked out right after shooting began. While I am a huge fan of Ms. Rai-Bachchan and I am absolutely crazy about all of her movies with Hrithik Roshan, I do not blame her for passing on this. Sonia isn`t worthy of her talents. Still, she does make an appearance of a sort. Hrithik Roshan reads an article of Cosmopolitan magazine with her on the cover. I do not know what happened with Kareena Kapoor-Khan, but I wish she had done it. She has the moxie to make characters like Sonia interesting.This movie was also Ameesha Patel's debut and while she is not a ""bad"" actress, you can tell she is raw. She is beautiful to look at, and she has moments when she is hysterically funny; but when it comes to the heavier emotional scenes, she falls apart. It is a shame, the first half of the movie she is quite fun to watch. Her jealousy over other girls throwing themselves at Rohit is a blast, and she had a great ""isn't she adorable"" quality to her. It is easy to see why Rohit falls for her. Even though Sonia is not the sharpest knife in the drawer, and she makes the guy want to strangle her at times, they fit well. He is adorable, she is adorable, and it makes sense. Why does Raj fall for her? I am trying to figure that one out... during the big climax she takes a side trip to crazy-town! You will just have to see it to believe it.I do not want you to think that I do not like this movie. In fact, I am glad I bought it and here is why: First, it has Anupam Kher in it! This man is amazing, bad guy, good guy, somewhere-in-between guy, drama, comedy; whatever he is doing, I love him! Seriously, I would buy a movie just because he is in it. He is a very bad guy in this one, worse than the villain he played in Vijay (talk about a trip to crazy-town), yet I cannot help but love him. Of course, it helps that unlike in Vijay the end made sense!Second, Farida Jalal is in it! I really adore her too; she takes the tiniest roles and burns herself into the film. I loved her as Simran's mother in ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" and it does not matter what I see her in I still love her.I love how Bollywood is a family affair! The director is the leading man's dad, so it is only fair that the leading lady has some family back up as well. Miss Patel gets hers by her mom who has a bit-part as Raj's mother. I have to say I found their one scene together to be very cute. I am a sentimental girl who loves her mom.Abhishek Sharma is an adorable munchkin who played Amit, Rohit's little brother. Cute kids by nature are usually scene stealers but this kid has some serious acting chops. His scenes with Hrithik Roshan alone make the movie worth paying for.Of course, even with all these good reasons to see the movie you really only need one. Hrithik Roshan. Despite this movie's flaws, it's his movie and he carries it with the same professionalism he has today. Taking on a dual role, in a first film as an adult in a leading role takes guts and commitment. He has more than enough of both and it showed. Is it his best work? No. Is it his best dancing? No. Is it a triumphant performance? Yes. Why? Simple, it makes the film do what it's meant to do: entertain you for just under three hours with escapism, mushy romance, a few giggles, and make you fall in love with the leading man.Why compare this movie with Paul Newman's debut in, ""The Silver Chalice?"" Well, it wasn't Paul Newman's best work and not even sap and a keen appreciation for the ridiculous could make it entertaining yet he became a legend. This movie might not be a masterpiece, but fifty years from now when Hrithik Roshan is a legend at least he won't have a ""The Silver Chalice"" on his filmography.The DVD has one little thing that bugged me, the logo of the company that released the DVD Eros is in the top left hand corner of the picture. I think they do it to avoid pirating which as we all know is a serious problem. There are no real special features, just previews. But don't let that deter you, I think what I got is well worth the price.",4,"Well...
