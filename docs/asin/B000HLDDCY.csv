It's a very general documentary about the Jewish situation in Europe during the time leading up to the conference and while I enjoy a good documentary, this one is too general for my tastes.  I have virtually all of the information here in other formats, making this redundant.

I say it is not quite as described because almost 30 minutes of the 51 minutes running time describes the situation of the Jews in Nazi Germany prior to the conference, leaving only 20 minutes for the conference itself. I think anyone who would buy this video knows most of this information, and wants information about the conference and what happened there. There was very little in the way of details in that regard. The production values were also slightly below average, with the audio of the narrator's voice being drowned out by the music.  It was also made before the Wannsee villa became a museum and learning center, so it is a little dated in that regard.
