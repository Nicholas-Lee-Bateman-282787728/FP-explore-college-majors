The fact that it features a new age concept of a child coming back to Earth was a big turn off as well. The movie just seemed out of sync to me most of the way through. It has some moments of suspense but they felt awkward. Fake violence is really hard to make convincing. This movie failed at it. I loved the crazy guy who thought the mother was an angel sent from General Patton. And I loved her performance. But all in all, this was just an average movie for me.",3,Contrived conflict and tension,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,563,"['hate', 'when', 'movie', 'plots', 'enhance', 'suspense', 'stupidity', 'movie', 'was', 'guilty', 'fact', 'new', 'age', 'concept', 'child', 'coming', 'back', 'Earth', 'was', 'big', 'turn', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'just', 'seemed', 'sync', 'most', 'way', 'moments', 'suspense', 'felt', 'awkward', 'Fake', 'violence', 'really', 'hard', 'make', 'convincing', 'movie', 'failed', 'loved', 'crazy', 'guy', 'who', 'thought', 'mother', 'was', 'angel', 'sent', 'General', 'Patton', 'loved', 'performance', 'was', 'just', 'average', 'movie']",Elizabeth's Gift

1529050,A239LPRBX4RJXL,B007ATHNF4,Jimfl47,"[0, 0]","I bought this movie because I really loved Kari Hawker in Christmas Angel. Kari seems to have the ability to act without effort and in my opinion was perfect for the role. Elizabeth's Gift is a very touching movie about a couple that lost their child due to a heart condition they were unaware their daughter had. The story tells the story of the parents plight to regain their happiness through love and a miracle, Elizabeth's Gift to them. I would recommend to anyone that loves movies that touch their hearts and has a real meaning in life. Since I loved Kari's performance in Christmas Angle and the price was right for this movie, I had no choice but to buy it. Glad I did.",5,A Meaningful inspirational movie,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,678,"['bought', 'movie', 'really', 'loved', 'Kari', 'Hawker', 'Christmas', 'Angel', 'Kari', 'have', 'ability', 'act', 'effort', 'opinion', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'Elizabeth', 'Gift', 'very', 'touching', 'movie', 'couple', 'lost', 'child', 'due', 'heart', 'condition', 'were', 'unaware', 'daughter', 'had', 'story', 'story', 'parents', 'plight', 'regain', 'happiness', 'love', 'miracle', 'Elizabeth', 'Gift', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'movies', 'hearts', 'real', 'meaning', 'life', 'loved', 'Kari', 'performance', 'Christmas', 'Angle', 'price', 'was', 'right', 'movie', 'had', 'choice', 'buy', 'Glad', 'did']",Elizabeth's Gift

Father, policeman, suggests mother do some volunteer work to help herself mentally.  Her dead daughter's spirit with rose petal leads her to a little girl living on street who had witnessed her mother being shot to death. This little girl is adopted by them. Film deals with crime, kidnapping of child, etc so there is plenty of story.  It is a movie that can be watched by entire family. It would help to have Kleenex nearby as it is very emotional.",5,Wonderful movie about life,1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,518,"['Excellent', 'movie', 'little', 'girl', 'dies', 'unknown', 'heart', 'condition', 'Father', 'policeman', 'mother', 'do', 'volunteer', 'work', 'help', 'mentally', 'dead', 'daughter', 'spirit', 'rose', 'petal', 'little', 'girl', 'living', 'street', 'who', 'had', 'witnessed', 'mother', 'being', 'shot', 'death', 'little', 'girl', 'adopted', 'Film', 'deals', 'crime', 'kidnapping', 'child', 'etc', 'so', 'plenty', 'story', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'entire', 'family', 'would', 'help', 'have', 'Kleenex', 'nearby', 'very', 'emotional']",Elizabeth's Gift
