George Lucas has, with the Clone Wars series, achieved what he set out to do so many years ago: he's created a fantastical science fiction series for kids.I'm not begrudging him this. After all, Lucas has stated numerous times that *this* is what Star Wars is meant to be. I loved the original trilogy ... when I was a kid. As an adult, I see the flaws in each of the first three films. Especially ROTJ, whose Ewoks were so clearly family-centric.So good on Lucas for achieving this. My 5 y.o. loves this series, and I can see why: the iconic-looking clones, the lightsaber-weilding Jedi, the two-dimensional bad guys you love to hate, space battles, unusual aliens ... it's a child's playland full of colorful characters and just a little bit of complexity.

Even though it's briefly shown in the prequel films and a cool little cartoon made in 2003, there is still a lot to explore.Following the 2008 CGI Clone Wars movie, this show features the same funky blocky characters and semi-artistic rendering, but it seems to be of higher quality. Lighting effects, animation movements, lip movements, and action scenes overall seem much improved from the pilot film. More importantly, with multiple story lines to follow, the series offers better stories with deeper issues and stronger characters (characters ranging from the main heroes Anakin, Yoda, Obi-Wan, etc to the lesser known characters like Aayla Secura, Plo Koon, Kit Fisto, etc). The show has loads of great action scenes and high-quality effects. There are adventures on many different worlds (once again, some well-known like Naboo, Coruscant, etc to lesser-known ones like Iego), each offering imaginative design and impressive imagery. Production design (sets, props, costumes, vehicles, weapons, etc) matches the Star Wars universe and fits in perfectly; fans should be able to recognize a huge number of familiar elements, mixed in with cool new stuff. Music is not bad. All together, it's an awesome show that fits nicely in the franchise.This disc set features perfect PQ; I could not find any faults with it whatsoever. It's very sharp and clean, with excellent color and contrast. It is presented in an aspect ratio that is wider than the original broadcast version, providing more of the image to be seen.  Sound quality is acceptable (Dolby Digital 5.1), but as a lossy soundtrack, it's not as clean as it could have been, and lacks impact (despite the show's cool sound design). This set includes some cool extras (featurettes, a database feature, trailers, etc).

1227495,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B001PO53IO,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[22, 101]","And I'm someone who up until a few months ago, still loved the new trilogy (mostly) and I still consider Revenge of the Sith to be on par with the original trilogy. I've read at least 100 Star Wars books, and a great many of the games. I realize there is a lot of crap under the banner of Star Wars. But... this series is a horrendous abomination.The dialogue is beyond horrendous, and makes the most awkward ""love"" scenes in Episode II feel like the work of Shakespeare by comparison. It's worse even than typical children's' shows in that while it's obviously aimed for children, it's still unbelievably terrible, and so full of stupid puns and tired expressions and dull monotonous recitation of lines that I imagine even the target audience would be bored with these sequences, and fast forward through all but the battle scenes.Jar Jar Binks is rendered pleasant in comparison to this Padawan girl that Anakin is inexplicably given to train (Jedi Knights do not train Padawans; only Masters) whose entire role consists of generic ""tough girl"" sassy quips and ridicule.The 3D animation is what you'd expect from a LucasFilms budget, but perhaps to keep themselves linked with the much more successful Clone Wars micro-sodes by Genndy Tartakovsky, they retain the stupid shapes of people's heads that consists of various juxtapositions of gravity-defying squares, circles, and polygons. Count Dooku's beard looks like the triangular front-piece of an old-time freight train, and it looks stiff as metal, too.The battle scenes would certainly be the highest appeal for children, but for the non-children watcher, even those are usually made a mess by the constant stale quips and jabbering between Obi-Wan and Anakin and That Annoying Girl being spoken/yelled at one another throughout an entire sequence.General Grievous is just as useless and nonthreatening a villain as he was in the movie, and the droid shenanigans that are apparently meant to be ""humorous"" are jacked up tenfold from the movie, and ten times less cute/funny.Obviously the point of this series is to make an open-ended source of stories, no matter how stale or hackily written, to be exploited for episode fodder and money.",1,Episode II is Shakespearean by comparison,1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,2197,"[""'m"", 'someone', 'who', 'up', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'still', 'loved', 'new', 'trilogy', 'mostly', 'still', 'consider', 'Revenge', 'Sith', 'be', 'par', 'original', 'trilogy', ""'ve"", 'read', 'least', '100', 'Star', 'Wars', 'books', 'great', 'many', 'games', 'realize', 'lot', 'crap', 'banner', 'Star', 'Wars', 'series', 'horrendous', 'abomination.The', 'dialogue', 'horrendous', 'most', 'awkward', 'love', 'scenes', 'Episode', 'II', 'feel', 'work', 'Shakespeare', 'comparison', 'worse', 'even', 'typical', 'children', 'shows', 'obviously', 'aimed', 'children', 'still', 'unbelievably', 'terrible', 'so', 'full', 'stupid', 'puns', 'tired', 'expressions', 'dull', 'monotonous', 'recitation', 'lines', 'imagine', 'even', 'target', 'audience', 'would', 'be', 'bored', 'sequences', 'fast', 'forward', 'battle', 'scenes.Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks', 'rendered', 'pleasant', 'comparison', 'Padawan', 'girl', 'Anakin', 'inexplicably', 'given', 'train', 'Jedi', 'Knights', 'do', 'not', 'train', 'Padawans', 'only', 'Masters', 'entire', 'role', 'generic', 'tough', 'girl', 'sassy', 'quips', 'ridicule.The', '3D', 'animation', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'LucasFilms', 'budget', 'perhaps', 'keep', 'linked', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'micro-sodes', 'Genndy', 'Tartakovsky', 'retain', 'stupid', 'shapes', 'people', 'heads', 'various', 'juxtapositions', 'gravity-defying', 'squares', 'circles', 'polygons', 'Count', 'Dooku', 'beard', 'triangular', 'front-piece', 'old-time', 'freight', 'train', 'stiff', 'metal', 'too.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'would', 'certainly', 'be', 'highest', 'appeal', 'children', 'non-children', 'watcher', 'even', 'are', 'usually', 'made', 'mess', 'constant', 'stale', 'quips', 'jabbering', 'Obi-Wan', 'Anakin', 'Annoying', 'Girl', 'being', 'spoken/yelled', 'one', 'entire', 'sequence.General', 'Grievous', 'just', 'useless', 'nonthreatening', 'villain', 'was', 'movie', 'droid', 'are', 'apparently', 'meant', 'be', 'humorous', 'are', 'jacked', 'up', 'tenfold', 'movie', 'ten', 'times', 'less', 'cute/funny.Obviously', 'point', 'series', 'make', 'open-ended', 'source', 'stories', 'matter', 'how', 'stale', 'hackily', 'written', 'be', 'exploited', 'episode', 'fodder', 'money']",Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Season 1

However, I saw the movie, and have watched every episode of this series, and I have to say that it's actually really good. It's a way to continue the Star Wars saga for those of us who are going through withdrawal from the original and prequel trilogies. Most of the vocal talent is close enough to the real actors to make you forget that they're not the same people, and the storylines are entertaining.

1227498,A18SLX1JESM0EX,B001PO53IO,A reviewer in Atlanta,"[1, 2]","Great addition to the Star Wars legacy.  I think animation greatly frees some aspects that were more difficult when you had live action, even with CGI.  Yes, some of the dialogue can be lame.  I agree with the individual that every writer should be fined, flogged or both every time they write, ""I got a bad feeling about this"" for ANY character.  It's uttered by a different character in almost every episode.At times you feel the Jedi are really showing their strengths and why they were so powerful.  Other times, you kind of go, ""huh?""  Case in point: in one episode Obi Wan is about to catch the bad guy.  He's right there.  The bad guy throws some capsules off a three-story high platform (or more) that will be disastrous if they hit the ground.  Does Obi Wan use The Force to suspend them in mid-air?  Nope.  Throws himself off the platform to catch them in his hands while falling to the ground himself.  While it certainly adds to the dramatic tension (the bad guy throws or threatens to throw these things repeatedly to thwart capture), it seems you could stay truer to Jedi capabilities and find dramatic tension another way.  There are a number of instances like that where they don't do things that would be very simple, while using The Force in very dramatic ways elsewhere.One other surprise.  In one episode, a trooper exclaims, ""What the h*ll?!""  What the h*ll, indeed.  While I could see the inclusion of such an exclamation in a director's cut, that kind of language has no place in the series. Now I'm hesitant about letting my 5 year-old watch the episodes.Those are my caveats.  Other than that, the series is entertaining and forwards the whole storyline from the ""missing years"" between the live action episodes.  It would almost (ALMOST, I say) be a welcome addition to have one or two small interactions inserted into Episodes IV, V & VI where Vader encounters R2D2.  He's so close to the droid in this series, you could really put some subtle moments in where one recognized the other and was torn about what to do.

1227503,AN6Y4IYXXDNVV,B001PO53IO,Bob02,"[1, 1]","If you're looking for a review which tells you about how the DVD looks visually, go ahead and click on another one.  You're seeing Star Wars through the eyes of someone who's been blind since birth.  How's that grab ya?  I will tell you that the show takes place between episodes II and III.  I'll tell you that it is, in my opinion, one of the best things on TV these days.  And if you want to know more then you'll just have to read on.I've been watching this show since it first heired, and it just keeps getting better and better each season.  And I just love this season boxset.  You know the drill.  It's a complete season set so you get all 22 episodes.  And some 64 page booklet which I haven't had anyone go over with me yet.  Blind guy + concept art = no fun unless you have someone who really knows how to describe the stuff in vivid detail.  But I'm sure it's a treat.  Buy the set and see for yourself.  Don't take my word for it concerning the booklet.Many people I grew up with detest the prequels and therefor, skip this series.  But I grew up with episodes 1-3 so I see nothing wrong with them.  And I see nothing wrong with this hit series either.  You like lightsaber duels?  Ok, there are plenty.  Space battles?  Um, it's Star Wars so of course there are a tun of those.I enjoy the ground battles.  Clones versus droids seems a bit more in your face when they're doing it on foot.  But yes, I still enjoy the space battles. They're very epic and not to be missed.  I only wish that this series had one of those separate audio tracks for the blind.  Not that I use those all that much.  I think the narration is a bit distracting at times.  I'd probably watch the show without them first, then go back and turn on Mr. Disembodied Voice to get a better feel for whatever episode I was interested in.  They should get Tom Kane to do it!  He voices Yoda in the series as well as the narrator at the beginning of each episode.If I had to pick a few favorite episodes from season 1, I'd go with Ambush. It spotlights Yoda and a few clones.  For one thing, I've always loved Yoda.  He's just so wise, but at the same time he can own you with a lightsaber.  And all the clones are important to him.  To this little guy, everyone has a face and a name.  Then I'd have to choose the Ryloth trilogy.  It's loaded with action and we get to see a bit more of one of the Separatist higher-ups then we did in episode II.  And last of all but certainly not least, there's Rookies.  Enough said.  Just buy the set and see for yourself if you're unfamiliar with the series.I only wish these episodes heired in chronological order.  You can watch any of these arcs in whatever order you like and not get lost, but I've always been a sucker for watching things from beginning to end.  OCD?  Well, maybe just a little.  I'm hoping Dave Filoni will release an episode by episode timeline before all is said and done so I don't have to keep consulting wookieepedia to see whatnot appeared in flashbacks in such and such an episode-- EG battles etc.  But Filoni, director of the series, is very passionate about the Star Wars universe as a whole.  So I can see him doing this eventually.That's about all I can think of for now.  I could rant about how much of a blast I have watching this series, but that would fill up page after page.  Just buy season 1 and give the show a chance.

However, after hearing that Darth Maul was coming back, I decided to try it out - and ended up loving it.The show is very respectful of the movies and does a good job building upon the themes in the original and prequel trilogies while adding its own new characters and stories. Ashoka Tano, Anakin's apprentice, has a wonderful combination of sass and charm. Assaj Ventress, Dooku's apprentice, adds the first true female villain to the series. Even more impressive, the series makes you care about the clone troopers, who act much more like American G.I.s than Stormtroopers. The very first episode, which features Yoda, reminded me much more of Yoda from empire Strikes Back than anything in the prequels. His love for nature and emphasis on cunning over brute strength. Even Jar Jar and the Battle Droids, who come across as ridiculous in the movie, are genuinely funny in the show.While there are some ""silly"" moments, the show is much more mature than you might expect from a cartoon. In some of the better episodes, the show depicts the reality of war far better than Attack of the Clones. ""Innocents of Ryloth"" was particularly moving, with the little Twilek girl who tagged along with the clone troopers. Cad Bane, the new bounty hunter, brings a new level of awesomeness and brutality. Bane kills his enemies without remorse, even going so far as to kill Jedi babies.Overall, if you like Star Wars I'd recommend giving the show a try. It's not just for kids.

The movie sets up a lot of the basis behind new characters involved in this series such as Anakan Skywalker's Padawan (Ahsoka Tano), and Count Dookus Apprentice or assassin, Asajj Ventress. These two characters will be involved with many of the tales without any history provided short of the movie.  Now on to the series.When I first played it I was not completely engulfed into it (like a Star Wars movie), but once I got adjusted to the animation and the storyline picked up I was hooked.  It is as action Packed as the Star Wars films.  And although it might not have exactly the same actors who played in the movies voicing their character, the voice over actors are great and almost sound like the actor who originally played each part.  The only time I really noticed it was when Count Dooku emerged.  You can tell that this is not Christopher Lee voicing the character.  Not that it does not sound like Christopher Lee, it is just that the voice over actor is actually better at playing this part than Lee. The plot line of most episodes are well written and will please most Star Wars fans (Even those who call themselves Trekkers).The case this set comes in is as unique as the show itself.  It is not a standard plastic case with a leaflet or two thrown inside.  It is a Book that has two sturdy holders on each hardback book cover to hold your dvds in place.  As a bonus it includes a 66 page book in the center featuring concept drawings of the show and other items of interest used in the development of this show.

I have seen the movies dozens of times and still remember seeing the original at the drive in (!) in 1977 all summer long.  I've read all the best Star Wars books (*cough*TimothyZahn*cough*), played most of the games, have all the music on my ipod and saw Episode III at midnight.  Yea, I'm a fan.  Episode 1 and 2 didn't do it for me, but EP3 brought Lucas back into my good graces.Despite being a hard core fan, I refused to see a Star Wars cartoon in a movie theater.  Rubbish! I declared.  How can Star Wars be a blocky cartoon?That was a mistake.  When I finally got the movie on DVD, it was fantastic.  When this show came out on Cartoon Network, finally, for the first time in YEARS I had a Sci Fi show that I actually looked forward to watching each week.  Yes, its a cartoon.  Yes, I would prefer a live action show or another movie, but I know that is later and never (respectively).  Yes, it could be geared a little more toward adults (but then BattleStar Galactica was so much geared toward adults, that I couldn't watch it.  Its softcore porn wrapped in a swearfest, served with torture and gore... oh goody.  Lorne Greene is spinning in his grave...) but in the end, just about every episode of Clone Wars is memorable, with little to no filler.Parts of it are recycled, some of the scenes are almost stolen right from the movies, but it works, it works, it works.  And there is enough new material to overlook the recycled parts.  I like the quips, I like the new Padawan and the action scenes are fantastic.I don't give away 5 stars easily.  And if you're turned off at my comments about ""BS"" Galactica and think your shows need more porn and gore, not less, you might be turned off a bit at Clone Wars.After EP3, I thought I would never get a chance to invest my imagination in the Star Wars universe again, but Clone Wars proved me dead, dead wrong.EDIT - My review is based on having seen every episode.

Combs,"[1, 3]","I've been a Star Wars fan my whole life (I saw Empire Strikes Back in the theater when I was 3); seen all the movies, read many of the books until it got to be overkill (thumbs down Kevin J. Anderson!), etc.  I enjoyed the Gennedy Tartarovsky ""Clone Wars"" series, although I feel that series focused too much on the darker part of Anakin's personality, preventing him from being likable; I can understand the reason for this, because some people would have a hard time with him becoming Vader in Ep. III if he was really likeable, but he was supposed to be a great hero.  When the Clone Wars movie came out, I passed on it, but gave the series a try.I haven't regretted it; the animation is excellent, with fluid movements and intense action scenes.  Many of the characters emote well and can be very lively, Mace Windu being one of the exceptions for some reason.  The battles are just as intense as the firefights and space battles from the original movies, with soldiers from both sides dying in large numbers and there being a lot of action.  The battle droids are humorous, and it has done a lot of development for all the characters; we see most of the Jedi  Council in action, Ahsoka grows up some, especially later on in the season where a battle costs her soldiers' lives.  Anakin is more of a daredevil warrior type, and comes off a lot more likeable than he does in the movies or GT's cartoon series, which I think fits better.  The half-flirty interactions between Obi-Wan and Ventress are interesting and a little unexpected, and General Grievous gets a pretty nice story arc that explains him and why he's now 90% droid; the interaction between Grievous and his ""Doctor"" were funny and I hope the Doctor shows up again.  The show also introduces one of the best new characters in the Star Wars Universe: bounty hunter Cad Bane.  This guy is great; from the moment he looks up from under his oversize hat and tells a Senate Guard ""Son, I wouldn't be doing that."", you know you're in for a very different type of underworld character that's effective, intimidating, and iconic.  Bane, far more than Ahsoka (who's ok, in an annoying teen sort of way), is the strongest character introduced so far, and hints at the darker future awaiting the galaxy.Despite my enjoyment of the series, there are a few things I don't like, and some discrepancies from the movies.  Some might be addressed in the Clone Wars movie, which I haven't  seen, but here the issues are:1.  While the lesson in the beginning of each episode is cute and reminds me of the ones at the end of many '80s cartoons, the newsreel is annoying.  The voice over for it is just way too overdramatic, which is a shame because it's the same guy who voices  the Admiral, who seems ok.2.  Count Dooku - I think he continues to be shortchanged in the series like he did in the movie; for starters, he lacks the Christopher Lee elegance when we've seen him thus far.  In addition, the whole galaxy seems to know he's a  Sith Lord now.  Even the Jedi didn't know that at the end of Ep. II.  When did that happen, and if it did, why doesn't anyone, including Sidious, call him Darth Tyrannus?  In addition, in Ep. II, Dooku tried to win over Obi-Wan by indicating he wanted to destroy the Sith and reform the Republic, which is allegedly becoming very corrupt.  Did he decide ""Ah heck, I'll just ditch that cover.""?  Because in the series he seems more focused on being sinister than anything else, and I think that removes the surface aspect of what the Clone Wars are about according to the movies and many of the books, which is the Separatists want to leave the Republic because it is corrupt and no longer governs well.3.  Relates to #2 in, ""what is the Separatist movement about?""  Like I stated before, the idea behind the Separatists are they want to leave the Republic because it has become corrupt and cannot run the galaxy, which gives Palpatine the excuse to gain more power and eventually transform the Republic into the Empire.  Based on the series, one would think the Separatists consist of 7 and a half (half being Grievous) living characters and a bunch of droids.  Ok, we know the head guys are greedy and evil, like the Viceroy and Grievous, but where's the Separatist viewpoint that leads Anakin to accuse Padme of sounding like a Separatist in Ep. III?  It would be interesting to see Separatists that aren't totally evil or see some obvious (Palpatine/Sidious isn't obvious) examples of Republic corruption in the series.4.  Like a few others have complained, there is no indication of a friendship between Bail Organa and Obi-Wan Kenobi.Overall though, I think the series is an excellent addition to the Star Wars universe and does a lot for connecting the bridge between Ep. II and Ep. III, and is enjoyable to watch.  I recommend it.",4,"Very good, but with a few discrepancies",1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,4823,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Star', 'Wars', 'fan', 'whole', 'life', 'saw', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'theater', 'when', 'was', '3', 'seen', 'movies', 'read', 'many', 'books', 'got', 'be', 'overkill', 'thumbs', 'down', 'Kevin', 'J', 'Anderson', 'etc', 'enjoyed', 'Gennedy', 'Tartarovsky', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'series', 'feel', 'series', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'darker', 'part', 'Anakin', 'personality', 'preventing', 'being', 'likable', 'can', 'understand', 'reason', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'becoming', 'Vader', 'Ep', 'III', 'was', 'really', 'likeable', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'great', 'hero', 'When', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'passed', 'gave', 'series', 'try.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'regretted', 'animation', 'excellent', 'fluid', 'movements', 'intense', 'action', 'scenes', 'Many', 'characters', 'emote', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'lively', 'Mace', 'Windu', 'being', 'one', 'exceptions', 'reason', 'battles', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'intense', 'firefights', 'space', 'battles', 'original', 'movies', 'soldiers', 'sides', 'dying', 'large', 'numbers', 'being', 'lot', 'action', 'battle', 'droids', 'are', 'humorous', 'done', 'lot', 'development', 'characters', 'see', 'most', 'Jedi', 'Council', 'action', 'Ahsoka', 'up', 'especially', 'later', 'season', 'where', 'battle', 'soldiers', 'lives', 'Anakin', 'more', 'daredevil', 'warrior', 'type', 'off', 'lot', 'more', 'likeable', 'movies', 'GT', 'cartoon', 'series', 'think', 'fits', 'better', 'half-flirty', 'interactions', 'Obi-Wan', 'Ventress', 'are', 'interesting', 'little', 'unexpected', 'General', 'Grievous', 'pretty', 'nice', 'story', 'arc', 'why', 'now', '90', '%', 'droid', 'interaction', 'Grievous', 'Doctor', 'were', 'funny', 'hope', 'Doctor', 'up', 'again', 'show', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'new', 'characters', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Universe', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Cad', 'Bane', 'guy', 'great', 'moment', 'up', 'oversize', 'hat', 'Senate', 'Guard', 'Son', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'doing', 'know', ""'re"", 'very', 'different', 'type', 'underworld', 'character', 'effective', 'intimidating', 'iconic', 'Bane', 'far', 'more', 'Ahsoka', 'who', 'ok', 'annoying', 'teen', 'sort', 'way', 'strongest', 'character', 'introduced', 'so', 'far', 'hints', 'darker', 'future', 'awaiting', 'galaxy.Despite', 'enjoyment', 'series', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'discrepancies', 'movies', 'might', 'be', 'addressed', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'here', 'issues', 'are:1', 'lesson', 'beginning', 'episode', 'cute', 'ones', 'end', 'many', ""'80s"", 'cartoons', 'newsreel', 'annoying', 'voice', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'overdramatic', 'shame', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'Admiral', 'who', 'ok.2', 'Count', 'Dooku', 'think', 'be', 'shortchanged', 'series', 'did', 'movie', 'starters', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'elegance', 'when', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thus', 'far', 'addition', 'whole', 'galaxy', 'know', 'Sith', 'Lord', 'now', 'Even', 'Jedi', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'end', 'Ep', 'II', 'When', 'did', 'happen', 'did', 'why', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'including', 'Sidious', 'call', 'Darth', 'Tyrannus', 'addition', 'Ep', 'II', 'Dooku', 'tried', 'win', 'Obi-Wan', 'indicating', 'wanted', 'destroy', 'Sith', 'reform', 'Republic', 'allegedly', 'becoming', 'very', 'corrupt', 'Did', 'decide', 'Ah', 'heck', ""'ll"", 'just', 'ditch', 'cover.', 'series', 'more', 'focused', 'being', 'sinister', 'anything', 'else', 'think', 'surface', 'aspect', 'what', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'are', 'according', 'movies', 'many', 'books', 'Separatists', 'want', 'leave', 'Republic', 'corrupt', 'longer', 'governs', 'well.3', '2', 'what', 'Separatist', 'movement', 'stated', 'idea', 'Separatists', 'are', 'want', 'leave', 'Republic', 'become', 'corrupt', 'can', 'not', 'run', 'galaxy', 'Palpatine', 'excuse', 'gain', 'more', 'power', 'eventually', 'transform', 'Republic', 'Empire', 'Based', 'series', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'Separatists', 'consist', '7', 'half', 'half', 'being', 'Grievous', 'living', 'characters', 'bunch', 'droids', 'Ok', 'know', 'head', 'guys', 'are', 'greedy', 'evil', 'Viceroy', 'Grievous', 'where', 'Separatist', 'viewpoint', 'Anakin', 'accuse', 'Padme', 'sounding', 'Separatist', 'Ep', 'III', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'Separatists', 'are', ""n't"", 'totally', 'evil', 'see', 'obvious', 'Palpatine/Sidious', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'examples', 'Republic', 'corruption', 'series.4', 'few', 'others', 'have', 'complained', 'indication', 'friendship', 'Bail', 'Organa', 'Obi-Wan', 'Kenobi.Overall', 'think', 'series', 'excellent', 'addition', 'Star', 'Wars', 'universe', 'lot', 'connecting', 'bridge', 'Ep', 'II', 'Ep', 'III', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'recommend']",Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Season 1

The plots were good, the battle scenes were outstanding, and absolutely loved the sound track and music. The animation can be divided in two parts. The first half of the season I would have to get the character animation 3 stars. The nonhuman characters were fine (except for Binks), but the human ones had that frozen look and looked more like the Thunderbird TV show. However as the season progressed, I was seeing the skills of the animators growing, with better emotional expressions from the human characters, which would merit a 4 star rating. That's not surprising to see that progression. When I look back on the Star Trek the Next Generation, you compare season 1 to let's say season 4 you do notices a upgrade in production quality. From what I hear from the following seasons of the Clone Wars the trend of improvement of the animation can be seen and I am looking forward to watching them. One of the things that I really enjoyed is being introduced to new characters from the Jedi Order.

Amazon is so bad at informing of bonus features I thought some might want to know what this Blu-Ray (or DVD) set will include.This is from the press release (which also notes the release date as 3 Nov.):Star Wars: The Clone Wars The Complete Season One is presented in widescreen with English, Spanish and French 5.1 DTS audio and English, French and Spanish subtitles.Bonus features include:* Seven Director's Cut Episodes: Rising Malevolence, Shadow of Malevolence, Lair of Grievous, Rookies, Storm Over Ryloth, Innocents of Ryloth and Liberty on Ryloth* 22 Episodic Featurettes that go behind-the-scenes with Supervising Director Dave Filoni and crew about the making-of each episode* Spectacular 64-page production journal that includes early sketches, artist notes, and concept art from each episode from Season One* Blu-ray Exclusive -- The Jedi Temple Archives: An extensive database exploring test footage, early concept art, 3-D character and object turnarounds and early animation. The Archives is a rare look at the assets in various stages of creation for The Clone Wars, with a wealth of surprises and never-before seen moments sprinkled throughout.UPDATE: Now I have the set and can add that the disks are Region Free (I play them on my European BD player) and are encased in a book cover with a 62-page book. The front flap holds disk 1 and the back flap holds disks 2 and 3. The book is 64 pages (including front and back cover) of amazing artwork and behind-the-scenes pictures, scans, script pages, info, background, character drafts, etc for the entire first season. I hope some body uploads some scans or photos to the product page so you can see the detail. It is excellent! I can't believe they included so much in this set for such a low price.The packaging is well done allowing disk removal without scratching. Each disk holds 7 or 8 episodes, which run back-to-back as one long movie (however with the ""Clone Wars"" logo and news real preceding each).The bonus features are similar to Seinfeld's ""Inside Look"" features where each episode is dissected - in this case mostly by director Dave Filoni with an occasional guest - either a writer or producer. There aren't picture-in-picture tracks, everything is done as stand-alone featurettes - one for each episode. There are hidden content within each featurette where you can hit the ""enter"" key on your remote at certain cued times to go into an animatic or design sketch, and then back where you left off.The ""Directors Cut"" episodes aren't noticeably longer and scarcely different from the aired versions. I noticed a few seconds added here and there, mostly to action sequences (space battles, saber battles, etc). I doubt the casual viewer will notice any difference at all. The quality of both audio and video is exactly as I hoped - top notch!Regardless: I can't recommend this set highly enough! It's such an amazing steal at this price and has a much bettter packaging than ROME or Battlestar Galactica which pretty much pissed me off! (You can't remove the disks in either of those box sets without scratching them since they are encased in cardboard sleeves with very shoddy casing!)Aside: In a commentary for the last episode (featuring bounty hunters and a new character named ""Cad Bane"") director Filoni reveals that Zero the Hutt will be back in season two for a run of episodes and that we'll see more of the Hutts throughout the Cone Wars!",5,Blu-Ray Glory with Exclusive Bonus Features!,1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,3499,"['Do', ""n't"", 'bad', 'posting', 'review', 'product', 'released', 'Amazon', 'so', 'bad', 'informing', 'bonus', 'features', 'thought', 'might', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'include.This', 'press', 'release', 'also', 'release', 'date', '3', 'Nov.', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'Complete', 'Season', 'One', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'English', 'Spanish', 'French', '5.1', 'DTS', 'audio', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'subtitles.Bonus', 'features', 'include', '*', 'Seven', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Episodes', 'Rising', 'Malevolence', 'Shadow', 'Malevolence', 'Lair', 'Grievous', 'Rookies', 'Storm', 'Over', 'Ryloth', 'Innocents', 'Ryloth', 'Liberty', 'Ryloth*', '22', 'Episodic', 'Featurettes', 'go', 'behind-the-scenes', 'Supervising', 'Director', 'Dave', 'Filoni', 'crew', 'making-of', 'episode*', 'Spectacular', '64-page', 'production', 'journal', 'early', 'sketches', 'artist', 'notes', 'concept', 'art', 'episode', 'Season', 'One*', 'Blu-ray', 'Exclusive', 'Jedi', 'Temple', 'Archives', 'extensive', 'database', 'exploring', 'test', 'footage', 'early', 'concept', 'art', '3-D', 'character', 'object', 'turnarounds', 'early', 'animation', 'Archives', 'rare', 'look', 'assets', 'various', 'stages', 'creation', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'wealth', 'surprises', 'never-before', 'seen', 'moments', 'sprinkled', 'throughout.UPDATE', 'Now', 'have', 'set', 'can', 'add', 'disks', 'are', 'Region', 'Free', 'play', 'European', 'BD', 'player', 'are', 'encased', 'book', 'cover', '62-page', 'book', 'front', 'flap', 'disk', '1', 'back', 'flap', 'disks', '2', '3', 'book', '64', 'pages', 'including', 'front', 'back', 'cover', 'amazing', 'artwork', 'behind-the-scenes', 'pictures', 'scans', 'script', 'pages', 'info', 'background', 'character', 'drafts', 'etc', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'hope', 'body', 'scans', 'photos', 'product', 'page', 'can', 'see', 'detail', 'excellent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'included', 'so', 'much', 'set', 'such', 'low', 'price.The', 'packaging', 'well', 'done', 'allowing', 'disk', 'removal', 'scratching', 'disk', '7', '8', 'episodes', 'run', 'back-to-back', 'one', 'long', 'movie', 'however', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'logo', 'news', 'real', 'preceding', '.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'similar', 'Seinfeld', 'Inside', 'Look', 'where', 'episode', 'dissected', 'case', 'mostly', 'director', 'Dave', 'Filoni', 'occasional', 'guest', 'writer', 'producer', 'are', ""n't"", 'picture-in-picture', 'tracks', 'everything', 'done', 'stand-alone', 'one', 'episode', 'are', 'hidden', 'content', 'featurette', 'where', 'can', 'hit', 'enter', 'key', 'remote', 'certain', 'cued', 'times', 'go', 'animatic', 'design', 'sketch', 'then', 'back', 'where', 'left', 'off.The', 'Directors', 'Cut', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'noticeably', 'longer', 'scarcely', 'different', 'aired', 'versions', 'noticed', 'few', 'seconds', 'added', 'here', 'there', 'mostly', 'action', 'sequences', 'space', 'battles', 'saber', 'battles', 'etc', 'doubt', 'casual', 'viewer', 'will', 'notice', 'difference', 'quality', 'audio', 'video', 'exactly', 'hoped', 'top', 'notch', 'Regardless', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'set', 'highly', 'enough', 'such', 'amazing', 'steal', 'price', 'much', 'bettter', 'packaging', 'ROME', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'pretty', 'much', 'pissed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remove', 'disks', 'box', 'sets', 'scratching', 'are', 'encased', 'cardboard', 'sleeves', 'very', 'shoddy', 'casing', 'Aside', 'commentary', 'last', 'episode', 'featuring', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'new', 'character', 'named', 'Cad', 'Bane', 'director', 'Filoni', 'Zero', 'Hutt', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'season', 'two', 'run', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more', 'Hutts', 'Cone', 'Wars']",Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Season 1

At first I wasn't sure if I should get this series set or not as I remembered the aforementioned series that came before this one but after seeing a few on cable it made my choice very easy to make, and while it doesn't reach the cgi advertisement cut scenes that Bioware did for the Knights of the old republic computer games it's still pretty decent and action packed enough that most star wars fans will be entertained by the series.  The series gives a nice look of the years of the clone wars and what was happening with the jedi between this time and Episode III,  especially with the background story with Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi as well as a few new characters including a young jedi that is Anakin's apprentice during the war and their connection as well.  It will seem a little funny since with us watching the prequel movies as you listen to the voices of Anakin and Obi-wan throughout the series but surprisingly they voice actors get you into the series with you thinking that they're Anakin and Obi-wan regardless on how they sound(Though the voice for Obi-wan sounded closer to the actor in the movies than the voice for Anakin).  The video and audio for the set is great no distortions to worry yourself about and the extras are pretty good as well but I'm sure many people like myself don't really bother to much with the extras as more to seeing the series itself.

1227574,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B001PO53IO,Sesho,"[1, 1]","Ever wonder what happened in the 3 year gap between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith? With all the hate directed towards the prequel movies, maybe you shouldn't answer that one.  Having recently rewatched the prequels in their new blu-ray incarnations, I think they are judged way too harshly. The most glaring weakness of the movies, especially episodes 2&3, are that they feel rushed. For example, Anakin falls too easily. Also, Anakin and Padme fall in love too easily. Lots of plot holes and explanations of those plot holes are seemingly left for other movies that will never get made. Well, that's now not necessarily true with the arrival of The Clone Wars cartoon. The creators are allowed to take their time building up characters and plotlines that could only be done superficially in the movies, including the classic original trilogy. It makes me wistfully wonder whether there might some day be a cartoon based on Episodes 4-6. There probably will.Season One was preceded by a full length movie, The Clone Wars, which is also available on Blu-ray, so make sure you watch that before you start the series. The main event of the movie was Anakin gaining his first and only (?) Padawan learner, the feisty but lovable Ahsoka. Most of the Jedi have become generals in the Republic Army, blissfully unaware that Chancellor Palpatine, aka Darth Sidious is orchestrating the entire Civil War with the help of Count Dooku, and HIS apprentice, Ventress, the not quite Sith assassin.While Anakin, Obi-wan, and Ahsoka are the main characters of the series, the writers seem to view the show as more of an ensemble piece. For instance, episode 1 stars Yoda, and not the crotchety know-it-all of the prequel films. He is shown more as the laughing trickster of Empire before Luke found out his true identity. I think he only laughed once in the prequel trilogy, and that wasn't very whole hearted. Other episodes feature Jedi that looked cool in the movies but sometimes never even spoke, like Luminara, Aayla Secura, and Kit Fisto. I guess Kit did have a semi-speaking part in Revenge of the Sith. IF you could call dying screaming like a little girl speaking. Other episodes feature clone troopers and even the much maligned Jar Jar Binks as the main stars.A lot of the episodes have 2-3 episode story arcs which are just as good as if not BETTER than any of the live action movies. I know this might sound incredible but after finishing the first season multi-part finale, I'm actually feeling like I enjoyed this TV show even more than the live action movies, EVEN the original trilogy which I completely loved. Watching the Clone Wars cartoon, the Star Wars universe just seems so much richer. You actually have time to deal with the consequences of character's actions.One of the things that bothered me about Attack of the Clones was when Anakin went berserk and killed all those sand people. Yoda sensed his pain and that something terrible had happened. But we never did get to see whether Yoda asked him about it. Or did Obi-wan ever ask him what happened on Tatooine. Or did Yoda or the Jedi ever think for one second WHO had really ordered the clone army to be manufactured. Like was it such a good idea to just show up on Kamino and just pick them up no questions asked. I would want to know who had ordered them and what their intentions were before I armed them and let them loose on the galaxy.While the live action movies didn't have time to ask questions like these, the cartoon does. For example, in one of the later episodes, a clone goes bad, or let's just say, he turns against the Republic. He sees the Republic and the Jedi as slavemasters, ordering him and his ""brothers"" to lay down their lives for no reason other than being commanded to. It really flips the tables on who is right in the Star Wars universe. One mystery that is further compounded by showing how individual the clones are is that it just seems unbelievable that they would carry out Order 66 so I hope the writers somehow figure out a way to resolve that.All in all, I loved this first season, and already have the next two on my shelf ready and waiting.",5,FILLING IN THE GAPS,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,4160,"['Ever', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', '3', 'year', 'gap', 'Attack', 'Clones', 'Revenge', 'Sith', 'hate', 'directed', 'prequel', 'movies', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'answer', 'one', 'Having', 'recently', 'rewatched', 'prequels', 'new', 'blu-ray', 'incarnations', 'think', 'are', 'judged', 'way', 'too', 'harshly', 'most', 'glaring', 'weakness', 'movies', 'especially', '2', '3', 'are', 'feel', 'rushed', 'example', 'Anakin', 'too', 'easily', 'Also', 'Anakin', 'Padme', 'fall', 'love', 'too', 'easily', 'Lots', 'plot', 'holes', 'explanations', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'seemingly', 'left', 'other', 'movies', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'made', 'Well', 'now', 'not', 'necessarily', 'true', 'arrival', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'cartoon', 'creators', 'are', 'allowed', 'take', 'time', 'building', 'up', 'characters', 'plotlines', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'done', 'superficially', 'movies', 'including', 'classic', 'original', 'trilogy', 'wistfully', 'wonder', 'might', 'day', 'be', 'cartoon', 'based', 'Episodes', '4-6', 'probably', 'will.Season', 'One', 'was', 'preceded', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'also', 'available', 'Blu-ray', 'so', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'start', 'series', 'main', 'event', 'movie', 'was', 'Anakin', 'gaining', 'first', 'only', 'Padawan', 'learner', 'feisty', 'lovable', 'Ahsoka', 'Most', 'Jedi', 'have', 'become', 'generals', 'Republic', 'Army', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'Chancellor', 'Palpatine', 'aka', 'Darth', 'Sidious', 'orchestrating', 'entire', 'Civil', 'War', 'help', 'Count', 'Dooku', 'HIS', 'apprentice', 'Ventress', 'not', 'quite', 'Sith', 'assassin.While', 'Anakin', 'Obi-wan', 'Ahsoka', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'series', 'writers', 'seem', 'view', 'show', 'more', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'instance', 'episode', '1', 'stars', 'Yoda', 'not', 'crotchety', 'know-it-all', 'prequel', 'films', 'shown', 'more', 'laughing', 'trickster', 'Empire', 'Luke', 'found', 'out', 'true', 'identity', 'think', 'only', 'laughed', 'once', 'prequel', 'trilogy', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'whole', 'hearted', 'Other', 'episodes', 'feature', 'Jedi', 'looked', 'cool', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'never', 'even', 'spoke', 'Luminara', 'Aayla', 'Secura', 'Kit', 'Fisto', 'guess', 'Kit', 'did', 'have', 'semi-speaking', 'part', 'Revenge', 'Sith', 'IF', 'could', 'call', 'dying', 'screaming', 'little', 'girl', 'speaking', 'Other', 'episodes', 'feature', 'clone', 'troopers', 'even', 'much', 'maligned', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks', 'main', 'stars.A', 'lot', 'episodes', 'have', '2-3', 'episode', 'story', 'arcs', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'BETTER', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'know', 'might', 'sound', 'incredible', 'finishing', 'first', 'season', 'multi-part', 'finale', ""'m"", 'actually', 'feeling', 'enjoyed', 'TV', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'EVEN', 'original', 'trilogy', 'completely', 'loved', 'Watching', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'cartoon', 'Star', 'Wars', 'universe', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'richer', 'actually', 'have', 'time', 'deal', 'consequences', 'character', 'actions.One', 'things', 'bothered', 'Attack', 'Clones', 'was', 'when', 'Anakin', 'went', 'berserk', 'killed', 'sand', 'people', 'Yoda', 'sensed', 'pain', 'something', 'terrible', 'had', 'happened', 'never', 'did', 'get', 'see', 'Yoda', 'asked', 'did', 'Obi-wan', 'ever', 'what', 'happened', 'Tatooine', 'did', 'Yoda', 'Jedi', 'ever', 'think', 'one', 'second', 'WHO', 'had', 'really', 'ordered', 'clone', 'army', 'be', 'manufactured', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'just', 'show', 'up', 'Kamino', 'just', 'pick', 'up', 'questions', 'asked', 'would', 'want', 'know', 'who', 'had', 'ordered', 'what', 'intentions', 'were', 'armed', 'let', 'loose', 'galaxy.While', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'ask', 'questions', 'cartoon', 'example', 'one', 'later', 'episodes', 'clone', 'bad', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Republic', 'Republic', 'Jedi', 'slavemasters', 'ordering', 'brothers', 'lay', 'down', 'lives', 'reason', 'other', 'being', 'commanded', 'really', 'tables', 'who', 'right', 'Star', 'Wars', 'universe', 'One', 'mystery', 'further', 'compounded', 'showing', 'how', 'individual', 'clones', 'are', 'just', 'unbelievable', 'would', 'carry', 'out', 'Order', '66', 'so', 'hope', 'writers', 'somehow', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'resolve', 'that.All', 'loved', 'first', 'season', 'already', 'have', 'next', 'two', 'shelf', 'ready', 'waiting']",Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Season 1

1227578,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B001PO53IO,Simon,"[1, 2]","This set collects the 22 episodes that comprise the first season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars. It follows the theatrical pilot, available separately asStar Wars: The Clone Wars (Widescreen Edition). Each adventure recounts the dramatic battles of the Clone Wars that take place between Episodes II and III of the movie saga.I had skipped season one during its initial broadcast - having caught the theatrical movie and not being impressed - but after watching through this set, I'm quite pleased with the results. What wasn't quite theatrical quality animation is in contrast leaps and bounds above conventional TV animation. This is some eye-popping stuff here - even accounting that Lucasfilm probably shelled out a bit more than your average TV budget, there are epic space battles, intricate Lightsaber duels, new planets and characters, and more. It's Star Wars, and it feels right. The stories are a mix of singular installments and two or three-part sagas. In a fun convention, each episode begins with a serial-style recap, regardless of whether or not there actually was a direct preceding installment. You can pretty much jump in at any point in the season and be up to speed.What doesn't work? The Battle Droids remain chatty and Jar Jar still makes you want to turn your TV off. Ahsoka Tano ends up faring much better than she did in the theatrical pilot - more eager apprentice and less ""Sky Guy"" arrogance. Really, the series' biggest fault is that ultimately, little of consequence can actually happen - the majority of characters meet their fate in Episode III, and as pointed out in the bonus features, Anakin and General Grevious can't actually meet face-to-face. The best stories revolve around the Clone Troopers or aspects of the war that don't directly involve trying to end it.This is a nicely produced DVD set - there is an attached booklet of concept art from the show, and each episode comes with a mini featurette that has cool production tidbits. I did find the set somewhat expensive - the Canadian sale price is higher than the American MSRP, so Americans are really getting a deal with this one.If you like Star Wars, this is worth picking up.",4,An Epic Dose of Star Wars for the Small Screen,1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,2174,"['set', '22', 'episodes', 'comprise', 'first', 'season', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'theatrical', 'pilot', 'available', 'separately', 'asStar', 'Wars', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'adventure', 'dramatic', 'battles', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'take', 'place', 'Episodes', 'II', 'III', 'movie', 'saga.I', 'had', 'skipped', 'season', 'one', 'initial', 'broadcast', 'having', 'caught', 'theatrical', 'movie', 'not', 'being', 'impressed', 'watching', 'set', ""'m"", 'quite', 'pleased', 'results', 'What', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'theatrical', 'quality', 'animation', 'contrast', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'conventional', 'TV', 'animation', 'eye-popping', 'stuff', 'here', 'even', 'accounting', 'Lucasfilm', 'probably', 'shelled', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'average', 'TV', 'budget', 'are', 'epic', 'space', 'battles', 'intricate', 'Lightsaber', 'duels', 'new', 'planets', 'characters', 'more', 'Star', 'Wars', 'right', 'stories', 'are', 'mix', 'singular', 'installments', 'two', 'three-part', 'sagas', 'fun', 'convention', 'episode', 'serial-style', 'recap', 'regardless', 'not', 'actually', 'was', 'direct', 'preceding', 'installment', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'jump', 'point', 'season', 'be', 'up', 'speed.What', ""n't"", 'work', 'Battle', 'Droids', 'remain', 'chatty', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'still', 'want', 'turn', 'TV', 'Ahsoka', 'Tano', 'up', 'faring', 'much', 'better', 'did', 'theatrical', 'pilot', 'more', 'eager', 'apprentice', 'less', 'Sky', 'Guy', 'arrogance', 'Really', 'series', 'biggest', 'fault', 'ultimately', 'little', 'consequence', 'can', 'actually', 'happen', 'majority', 'characters', 'meet', 'fate', 'Episode', 'III', 'as', 'pointed', 'out', 'bonus', 'features', 'Anakin', 'General', 'Grevious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'actually', 'meet', 'face-to-face', 'best', 'stories', 'revolve', 'Clone', 'Troopers', 'aspects', 'war', 'do', ""n't"", 'directly', 'involve', 'trying', 'end', 'it.This', 'nicely', 'produced', 'DVD', 'set', 'attached', 'booklet', 'concept', 'art', 'show', 'episode', 'mini', 'featurette', 'cool', 'production', 'tidbits', 'did', 'find', 'set', 'somewhat', 'expensive', 'Canadian', 'sale', 'price', 'higher', 'American', 'MSRP', 'Americans', 'are', 'really', 'getting', 'deal', 'one.If', 'Star', 'Wars', 'worth', 'picking', 'up']",Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Season 1

1227582,A26TTBH1QNCVSF,B001PO53IO,Some Guy,"[0, 0]","I'm a big fan of most things Star Wars.  I loved the original triology, I liked Revenge of the Sith, would give a nod to episode II and a shrug for episode I.  The Star Wars novels are hit and miss (The Thrawn Triology is the hallmark of any SW novel series), and the comic books are generally amazing.  When it comes to The Clone Wars microseries which preceeded the CG version currently running I was at a loss.  The microseries delivered action at a steady, relentless pace which eclipsed much of the story line and left little to no room for character development.  In regards to the action it is very over the top and unbvelievable even for Star Wars.  If the Jedi were truely capable of the feats shown in the microseries the war would have ended at Geonosis or Mace Windu would have killed Palpatine during their confrontation on Coruscant.  Anyway I'm sure your wondering where my review for the Clone Wars CG Animated series is... well its right here.The Clone Wars is awesome.  When it comes to cartoons I believe the Japanese are the best and I was delighted to learn that the style in which this series is portrayed was inspired by Japanese anime.  The animation does not degrade the action and lightsaber battles are as breathtaking as ever.  The characters actually resemble the actors who portrayed them in the movies and that is a testement to the talent Lucasfilms has working for it.When I started watching the series I expected poor dialogue and no character development but I was proven wrong.  The dialogue is good, all though ""I have a bad feeling about this,"" needs a rest as it is used at least once or twice per episode.  I actually found myself laughing at the character's remarks and even thinking that a few lines were witty.  To get to the point no one feels out of character when their speaking.  The voice acting is good and only gets better as the series goes on.  The voice actors really capture the essence of their characters, especially Count Dokku and Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious.Right from the start you get the impression that this is a character driven story which is my favorite kind.  Obiwan is still the calm Jedi Master and Anakan now a Jedi Knight excersises his new authority as a General by disobeying orders because he can.  A great new development for Anakin's character is the addition of his new padawan, Ashoka Tano.  Put simply Ashoka embodies Anakin as a padawan, she is defient, headstrong, a Jedi with seemingly limitless potential, but above all she forms connections.  Ashoka like Anakin understands the Jedi beliefs about forming connections but finds herself unable to not care about her new Master.  In little time at all Anakan finds himself attached to Ashoka as the series progresses and the question is asked can he let her go when the time comes?  Another interesting character is the clone Captain Rex.  Rex represents the clone soldier on the field of battle.  He is loyal to the Republic and the Jedi Generals he serves but he is not a mindless automaton.  Rex has a personality that comes out through the progression of the story.  He looks out for the men under his command and believes that the mark of a good commander is experience.So all in all The Clone Wars is a great series.  It embodies what Star Wars should be and while it might seem like a show for children it evolves to appeal for all ages.  I'm 22 and can't get enough this show.  So when you watch this series don't let it go right away if your feeling meh, give it time and you'll change your mind.  Like all things this show needs some time to warm up and when it does get ready for Star Wars as it should be.",5,Awesome addition to the Star Wars franchise,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,3655,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'most', 'things', 'Star', 'Wars', 'loved', 'original', 'triology', 'liked', 'Revenge', 'Sith', 'would', 'give', 'nod', 'episode', 'II', 'shrug', 'episode', 'Star', 'Wars', 'novels', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'Thrawn', 'Triology', 'hallmark', 'SW', 'novel', 'series', 'comic', 'books', 'are', 'generally', 'amazing', 'When', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'microseries', 'preceeded', 'CG', 'version', 'currently', 'running', 'was', 'loss', 'microseries', 'delivered', 'action', 'steady', 'relentless', 'pace', 'eclipsed', 'much', 'story', 'line', 'left', 'little', 'room', 'character', 'development', 'regards', 'action', 'very', 'top', 'unbvelievable', 'even', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Jedi', 'were', 'truely', 'capable', 'feats', 'shown', 'microseries', 'war', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'Geonosis', 'Mace', 'Windu', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'Palpatine', 'confrontation', 'Coruscant', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'sure', 'wondering', 'where', 'review', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'CG', 'Animated', 'series', 'well', 'right', 'here.The', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'awesome', 'When', 'cartoons', 'believe', 'Japanese', 'are', 'best', 'was', 'delighted', 'learn', 'style', 'series', 'portrayed', 'was', 'inspired', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'animation', 'not', 'degrade', 'action', 'lightsaber', 'battles', 'are', 'as', 'breathtaking', 'ever', 'characters', 'actually', 'resemble', 'actors', 'who', 'portrayed', 'movies', 'testement', 'talent', 'Lucasfilms', 'working', 'it.When', 'started', 'watching', 'series', 'expected', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'proven', 'wrong', 'dialogue', 'good', 'have', 'bad', 'feeling', 'rest', 'used', 'least', 'once', 'twice', 'episode', 'actually', 'found', 'laughing', 'character', 'remarks', 'even', 'thinking', 'few', 'lines', 'were', 'witty', 'get', 'point', 'one', 'character', 'when', 'speaking', 'voice', 'acting', 'good', 'only', 'better', 'series', 'voice', 'actors', 'really', 'capture', 'essence', 'characters', 'especially', 'Count', 'Dokku', 'Chancellor', 'Palpatine/Darth', 'Sidious.Right', 'start', 'get', 'impression', 'character', 'driven', 'story', 'favorite', 'kind', 'Obiwan', 'still', 'calm', 'Jedi', 'Master', 'Anakan', 'now', 'Jedi', 'Knight', 'new', 'authority', 'General', 'disobeying', 'orders', 'can', 'great', 'new', 'development', 'Anakin', 'character', 'addition', 'new', 'padawan', 'Ashoka', 'Tano', 'Put', 'simply', 'Ashoka', 'embodies', 'Anakin', 'padawan', 'defient', 'headstrong', 'Jedi', 'seemingly', 'limitless', 'potential', 'connections', 'Ashoka', 'Anakin', 'Jedi', 'beliefs', 'forming', 'connections', 'unable', 'not', 'care', 'new', 'Master', 'little', 'time', 'Anakan', 'attached', 'Ashoka', 'series', 'question', 'asked', 'can', 'let', 'go', 'when', 'time', 'interesting', 'character', 'clone', 'Captain', 'Rex', 'Rex', 'clone', 'soldier', 'field', 'battle', 'loyal', 'Republic', 'Jedi', 'Generals', 'not', 'mindless', 'automaton', 'Rex', 'personality', 'out', 'progression', 'story', 'out', 'men', 'command', 'mark', 'good', 'commander', 'experience.So', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'great', 'series', 'what', 'Star', 'Wars', 'should', 'be', 'might', 'seem', 'show', 'children', 'appeal', 'ages', ""'m"", '22', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'show', 'So', 'when', 'watch', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'right', 'away', 'feeling', 'meh', 'give', 'time', ""'ll"", 'change', 'mind', 'things', 'show', 'time', 'warm', 'up', 'when', 'get', 'ready', 'Star', 'Wars', 'should', 'be']",Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Season 1

The case itself is more like a book with the DVDs attached to the inside front and back of the cover.  In the middle are pages of production illustrations from the show including a few spoiler illustrations from Season 2.  The set feels like a nice hardcover book, not a cheap DVD keepcase.The extras are plentiful.  So far I've only had time to watch the first disc but every episode has a six-to-ten minute featurette specifically geared to that episode.  I prefer that to the generic featurettes and EPK materials usually included with TV series discs.  In addition, many of the episodes include additional materials.  But best of all, all of these episodes are in widescreen format, 2.35:1!  Even wider than the original Cartoon Network HD showings in 1.78:1.  This really helps the cinematic qualities of the show shine through.As to the show itself, it's never looked better.  LFL has created some of the best transfers ever for this set.  The episodes themselves are mostly entertaining and get better as the season progresses.  Early on I found myself a bit annoyed with the Ahsoka character but I could imagine that children would find her interesting.  The production staff seems to have been trying to walk a very thin line between the tone of the SW films and the new ""kiddie"" audience this show was bound to attract.

1227587,A1VR8CU042XWLJ,B001PO53IO,Todd D. George,"[0, 0]","I may be one of the few who actually enjoyed the prequel trilogy, so before I begin let me provide a brief bit of insight. I was 7 years old when ""Star Wars"" (which would eventually become Episode 4: A New Hope) was released theatrically. I saw that film SEVERAL times in 1977.Anyway as a piece of entertainment the season one collection of The Clone Wars is very well done. Yes it is a cartoon and the series runs on the cartoon network, but I think it finds a nice balance of staying true to the basic aspects of the films and being suitable for kids without putting adults to sleep. The storylines are complex and offer insight into aspects of the overall narrative (the clones as individuals, a look at other Jedi, and even an examination of the bad guys) that help support episode 3.The animation work is superior to most broadcast cartoons (as would be expected from Lucasfilm) and has a certain style visually that works for this series( yes if you are a fan of Pixar and Dreamworks animated features you will complain about certain aspects like the fact that hair doesn't behave in a manner that you may have come to expect, but these people where going for a different objective)Now please DO NOT BE FOOLED! I am supporting the animated series, not the animated ""film"" Clone Wars that was released a few months prior to the series which makes up this box set. I think it was a wise choice that the producers have kept the two VERY seperate.Visually the animation looks great, I have a PS3 and the discs play with no problems, the sound is great as would be the case with anything from the ""Star Wars"" world. Blu-ray is the format of choice for this box set, but even if you have a regular dvd play I am sure The Clone Wars set would look fantastic! My one overly fan boy comment would be that it would have been interesting if Lucas had made episode 3 but HELD on to it until after this series had run (let's all be honest, the film would have made good money even if it was release in 2012) it may have made the overall story stronger.If you can appreciate it Clone Wars series for what it really is (a chance to expand upon a story that wasn't really given a fair chance to be told from the start) then you will be pleasantly surprised with this box set.

Watching the individual episodes without the commercial break fade-outs and no Cartoon Network logo printed onscreen is the BEST way to see these wonderful shows!  Each episode has a corresponding featurette that outlines the production of that episode.  There is a booklet of arwork affixed to the center of the DVD case that affords a cool look into the storyteller's minds.My only complaint is:  I LOVE behind the scenes materials!  I would've really enjoyed something that showed even MORE aspects of their production... sculpting maquettes, scanning them, animation nodes, storyboard to digital comparisome... I can think of so much more I'd have loved to have seen... sniff... sob... I guess I can't have it all.It's a great pleasure to have the entire season at fingertip's grasp.  I was disappointed at the decision to release the episodes in individual DVD's containing a few episodes each.  I don't know how Lucasfilm made out on that decision, but I refused to buy them in that format and waited, hoping the entire season would be released as a whole.
