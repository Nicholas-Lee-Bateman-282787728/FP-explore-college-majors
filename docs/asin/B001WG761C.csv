I rate the whole series as 5-star but have to say, as with most series enders, this wasn't the best of the 6.  I still recommend it if you have the first five.  It is a definitive blending of small town life (anywhere), laid back querky Canadian humor at its best and has a great assemble cast of characters you can't help but fall in love with.  Again, I shall miss their craziness but am glad that I have the set to always look back to.",4,LOVE THIS SERIES,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,502,"['have', '6', 'Seasons', 'series', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'end', 'rate', 'whole', 'series', '5-star', 'have', 'say', 'most', 'series', 'enders', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', '6', 'still', 'recommend', 'have', 'first', 'five', 'definitive', 'blending', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'anywhere', 'laid', 'back', 'querky', 'Canadian', 'humor', 'best', 'great', 'assemble', 'cast', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'Again', 'shall', 'miss', 'craziness', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'set', 'always', 'look', 'back']",CORNER GAS: SEASON 6
1244951,A2HTDZV3IC3WDD,B001WG761C,"M. A. Edwards ""Dark Shadows Fan""","[0, 0]",I love Corner Gas.  This comedy is funny without bad lanugage.  Great for the whole family.  Too bad this is the last year.  I own all six seasons wish there were going to be many more.  This comedy is about everyday life in a small town named Dog River.  Much better than the Seinfield everyday life situations.,5,Wonderful!!!,1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,312,"['love', 'Corner', 'Gas', 'comedy', 'funny', 'bad', 'lanugage', 'Great', 'whole', 'family', 'Too', 'bad', 'last', 'year', 'own', 'six', 'seasons', 'wish', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'many', 'more', 'comedy', 'everyday', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'named', 'Dog', 'River', 'Much', 'better', 'Seinfield', 'everyday', 'life', 'situations']",CORNER GAS: SEASON 6

1244953,A2AIE9DO5QSVBD,B001WG761C,"Pop Bop ""Pause and Reflect""","[1, 1]","Season 6 marks a real drop off in series quality - poor writing and non-committal acting, with an overall bitter undertone. You may want to avoid it. Lots of the dialogue is just nasty, with no pretense of being humorous. The Wanda character, especially, is now just mean, and everyone else, (writers, directors, actors), seemed to be mailing it in. In many episodes from earlier seasons the characters were exasperated by each other, but there was still always a genial aspect to the good-natured ribbing. Here, there is a lot of edge with no saving cheer.We really enjoyed the previous seasons, but this season was not just not entertaining, it was so sour that it detracted from our fondness for the characters and for the earlier episodes. We finally tossed this season's DVD and agreed to pretend it didn't exist.",3,Very Disappointing Drop Off,1322092800,"11 24, 2011",2011,818,"['Season', '6', 'marks', 'real', 'drop', 'series', 'quality', 'poor', 'writing', 'non-committal', 'acting', 'overall', 'bitter', 'undertone', 'may', 'want', 'avoid', 'Lots', 'dialogue', 'just', 'nasty', 'pretense', 'being', 'humorous', 'Wanda', 'character', 'especially', 'now', 'just', 'mean', 'everyone', 'else', 'writers', 'directors', 'actors', 'seemed', 'be', 'mailing', 'many', 'episodes', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'characters', 'were', 'exasperated', 'other', 'there', 'was', 'still', 'always', 'genial', 'aspect', 'good-natured', 'ribbing', 'Here', 'lot', 'edge', 'saving', 'cheer.We', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'previous', 'seasons', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'not', 'entertaining', 'was', 'so', 'sour', 'detracted', 'fondness', 'characters', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'finally', 'tossed', 'season', 'DVD', 'agreed', 'pretend', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist']",CORNER GAS: SEASON 6

Check the exchange rate, the Canadian dollar is usually less than the US dollar.Season 6 has 19 new episodes that were not broadcast in the USA by WGN.  Some episodes are very good and some are OK but still enjoyable.  Some of the best episodes are:""Full Load"" were Lacey wins an eating contest,""American Resolution"" Oscar's nationality is in question,""Shirt Disturber"" Brent and Hank travel to a comic book convention,""Super Sensitive"" Davis tells too many blonde jokes and gets sent to sensitivity training,""R2 Bee Too"" Hank and Davis get toy robots,""Crab Apple Cooler"" Brent and Hank re-visit an old neighbor they played pranks on,""Happy Career Day to You"" Brent finds a 30 year old snack cake in the store,""Get the F Off My Lawn"" a wind storm blows the letters of the cafeand ""You've Been Great, Goodnight"" the show's finale.Season 6 does not have as many knock-out shows as the earlier seasons, but you won't be disappointed either.

But, after watching a second episode, I was totally hooked on the combination of almost slapstick as well as dry humor in this series. This series is very very funny. Canada has produced some of the best television  I have seen of late. If you like a cleaner variety of humor then something like, say, Trailerpark Boys, then this is the series for you.This series is totally addictive. I would suggest buying season 1 first and then working your way through all the seasons. This show has a following even way down here in Florida. The cool thing about Corner Gas is that the whole family can enjoy it, and in my case, my whole family likes the show. And that's something of a rarity in my house.",5,One of the best shows to come out in a long time!!,1273536000,"05 11, 2010",2010,773,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'part', 'episode', 'season', '1', 'was', 'somewhat', 'unimpressed', 'watching', 'second', 'episode', 'was', 'totally', 'hooked', 'combination', 'almost', 'slapstick', 'as', 'well', 'dry', 'humor', 'series', 'series', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'Canada', 'produced', 'best', 'television', 'have', 'seen', 'late', 'like', 'cleaner', 'variety', 'humor', 'then', 'something', 'say', 'Trailerpark', 'Boys', 'then', 'series', 'you.This', 'series', 'totally', 'addictive', 'would', 'suggest', 'buying', 'season', '1', 'first', 'then', 'working', 'way', 'seasons', 'show', 'following', 'even', 'way', 'down', 'here', 'Florida', 'cool', 'thing', 'Corner', 'Gas', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'case', 'whole', 'family', 'show', 'something', 'rarity', 'house']",CORNER GAS: SEASON 6
