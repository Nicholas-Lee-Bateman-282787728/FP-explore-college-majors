To be honest, I'm floored to actually see this movie here at amazon! I'm happy though, cause I get to bash it! Nothing at all was original...*white girl is a ""ghost"" and helps Marques duck the doctor time after time ""Duck. NOW!""*guys (Marques and Omarion) get tricked into going to another's out of the way cabin, thinking the sheriff is there just cause there's a police car there*Omarion picks up the phone and white powder comes out, that just so happens to knock him out (LMFAO!)*Marques LEAVES his friend and eventually falls down running from the killer*killer is actually a former doctor with a bad reputation of killing women *Y A W N**Marques' friends, including Omarion are locked up in cages and he *G U L P* FORGETS the keys*Marques GOES BACK only to see that the killer, who he stabbed in the back once and LEFT THE KNIFE WITH HIM, has left the building*Killer comes back and Marques gets knocked outI'll let you watch the rest of this pathetic mess. It WAS intriguing until too many of the trite occurrences pop out one after another.I watched this crappy movie on BET tonight BTW. It ended like an hour ago , Thank Goodness.Cover Art: D+Inside Art: N/AStory: FCharacters: C-Comic Relief: F-*Embarrassment It Brought: ALength: B-2.1 stars.Overall: D-Don't even buy this movie USED at 10 dollars, plus.
