1027546,A1NEIH01B5X6QL,B000JK8O7W,K. Faasse,"[3, 4]",I put this DVD in and thought that it would be helpful in helping me get back strength and shape after a bout with cancer and a stroke. I am unable to walk or stand well so the idea of a workout from a chair was very appealing. I was really surprised that I was not able to go much further than half of the first warm up. I had to laugh as I was used to swimming 25 laps in the lap pool before work each morning and 2 hours of exercise in the pool at night and here I was not even able to get through a warm up exercise sitting in a chair. Saying this I am recommending this video for anyone who is in need of getting back in shape because it will challenge you and give you a great work out even if you cannot last more than 10 minutes. I am looking forward to working my way up to going through the whole workout eventually. I want to encourage you to exercise even if you cannot get through the whole thing. IT MADE A DIFFERENCE even after 10 minutes time. So if you need to gain strength or get into shape GET THIS WONDERFUL DVD! The only irritating thing is the model who smiles like the cheshire cat.,5,SENIOR WORKOUT AT ITS BEST,1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,1106,"['put', 'DVD', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'helping', 'get', 'back', 'strength', 'shape', 'bout', 'cancer', 'stroke', 'am', 'unable', 'walk', 'stand', 'well', 'so', 'idea', 'workout', 'chair', 'was', 'very', 'appealing', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'go', 'much', 'further', 'half', 'first', 'warm', 'up', 'had', 'was', 'used', 'swimming', '25', 'laps', 'lap', 'pool', 'work', 'morning', '2', 'hours', 'exercise', 'pool', 'night', 'here', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'able', 'get', 'warm', 'up', 'exercise', 'sitting', 'chair', 'Saying', 'am', 'recommending', 'video', 'anyone', 'who', 'need', 'getting', 'back', 'shape', 'will', 'challenge', 'give', 'great', 'work', 'out', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'last', 'more', '10', 'minutes', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'working', 'way', 'going', 'whole', 'workout', 'eventually', 'want', 'encourage', 'exercise', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'whole', 'thing', 'IT', 'MADE', 'DIFFERENCE', 'even', '10', 'minutes', 'time', 'So', 'need', 'gain', 'strength', 'get', 'shape', 'GET', 'THIS', 'WONDERFUL', 'DVD', 'only', 'irritating', 'thing', 'model', 'who', 'cheshire', 'cat']",Easy Chair Exercises: Easy Sitting Pilates Calisthenics
