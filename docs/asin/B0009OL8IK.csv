Very cool-looking, too, in that old timey, black and white movie way.  The problem is that there is a gaping lack of character development.  The main character is a murderer who likes to pick up pretty blondes and hack them to death with his gardening shears.  Okay, but nowhere in the film is there anything offered to give the viewer any idea as to why this seemingly nice gardener is a killer.  I'm not asking to be hit over the head with this information, but a clue would have been nice.  It's hard to follow a character throughout a 90-minute film when you don't know anything about their background.

909596,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0009OL8IK,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[8, 9]","Being as woefully uninformed as I am, I'd never even heard of the American noir feature Without Warning! (1952) until Dark Sky Films released it onto DVD, but supposedly it's a rather obscure film considered `lost', one that's apparently been found, and found good...in my own, humble opinion.  Written by William Raynor (Target Earth, ""McHale's Navy"", ""Get Smart""), and directed by Arnold Laven (The Monster That Challenged the World, ""The Rifleman"", ""The Six Million Dollar Man""), the film stars Adam Williams (Vice Squad, The Proud and Profane, Fear Strikes Out), in his first, major film role.  Also appearing is Meg Randall (Criss Cross, Ma and Pa Kettle), Ed Binns (12 Angry Men, North by Northwest), Harlan Warde (Donovan's Brain, A Cry in the Night), Byron Kane (The Big Heat, Gog), and Angela Stevens (Creature with the Atom Brain, Devil Goddess).As the film opens we see a man, who we later learn is named Carl Martin (Williams) leaving a Hollywood motel room in the middle of the night in a bit of a rush, most likely due to the fact he just murdered a woman.  The body is found, and the police, including Lt. Pete Hamilton (Binns), make the scene.  Turns out this isn't Carl's first victim, as the police identify the odd wounds (inflicted by a gardening tool) as being similar of those in a previous unsolved murder.  As the investigations plods forward, we see Carl, a gardener by trade, carrying on with his normal routine.  The police have a few clues, but nothing really substantial, along with a theory about Carl's modus operandi...seems he likes his women blonde, married, unscrupulous, and slightly tipsy (hey, who doesn't?), and he tends to strike at certain time of the month.  Time passes and Carl eventually hooks up with another good time girl, but this time he nearly gets nicked as two motorcycle policemen stumble upon the scene (Carl took his date to a secluded underpass).  As Carl is swallowed up in the sea of anonymity a large city tends to offer, the police press forward, collecting more and more evidence, along with constructing a profile of the elusive killer with the aide of a police psychologist.  The authorities go so far as to set a trap, knowing what kind of bait the killer prefers, but Carl manages to get away yet again.  Oh, by the way, it's probably worth mentioning that the guy who runs the nursery where Carl buys his supplies from has a new employee named Jane (Randall), who, along with being a pretty young blonde, is also his daughter.  Let's just say this does not go unnoticed by Carl (he lika, he lika a lot)...eventually enough clues pile up to lead the authorities to Carl's doorstep, but will they be in time to nab this fiend before he strikes again?I enjoyed this film as I thought, overall, it was a fairly solid crime drama with a strong sense of direction (this was Lavin's first feature), and a number of good performances.  There were some aspects of the story I found a little hinky, the main one being how the character of Carl, who seemed genuinely sloppy in terms of leaving evidence behind, would have these moments of clarity, destroying certain pieces of incriminating evidence.  Case in point, after the opening sequence, Carl discovered part of his sport coat had been torn (a piece of the fabric was recovered at the crime scene).  He decided to take the coat in and get it fixed, but decided against it at the last moment for fear the police might have found the piece left behind and eventually be able to link it back to Carl (which, in fact, is what the police were trying to do, so much so they issued a bulletin to various tailors in the area to be on the lookout for someone bringing in a coat for repair made of a certain material).  At the last moment, just before giving the coat over to a tailor, Carl has second thoughts and ends up destroying the garment.  Why would he all of the sudden worry so much about a piece of a sport jacket, especially since he'd left so much else behind, specifically his fingerprints?  Ah well...the story is divided up into two parts, one being Carl, and the other being the investigation, the parts eventually coming together at the end.  I did like the forensics stuff, as there was quite a lot of detail given out as far as the kind of evidence collected at crime scenes, and how it's examined.  I did think it funny how the main scientist brewed his own coffee in a set-up in his lab, serving it up in beakers and such...this seems a dangerous practice, as one might accidentally grab a beaker of hydrochloric acid instead of a cup o' joe.  Live and learn, I suppose...another aspect I thought odd was how accurate the police psychologist was in terms of describing Carl's motivation behind his actions...talk about being dead on...as I said, I thought the performances were solid overall, my favorite being Ed Binns, who played the lead detective on the case.  Generally the criminal is more interesting in stories like these, but I found Binns' character charismatic and well put together.  He was an obviously intelligent and generally easygoing type, one who is now struggling to solve a series of brutal and senseless murders.  That's not to say Williams didn't come off well in his role.  One element I really liked about his character was he never really took it over the top.  He didn't seem overly intelligent, but he did have enough brains (and luck) to keep the authorities at bay for a while.  The story does move along well, wasting little time on unnecessary elements, wrapping up in a nice, tight little climatic finish.  While watching this film I couldn't help wonder about where Carl lived...he resided in house that had seen better days, up in the Hollywood hills, property which I'm sure now goes for an exceedingly premium price, given the view he had...something else worth mentioning...I thought the dialog good, nothing too fancy, but I thought it interesting the narrator should have some of the best lines, including this one, at the beginning, after the second victim is found...Narrator: They located the victim's husband and brought him in to identify the body.  He'd been working all night and hadn't even known his wife was on the loose.On the loose?  Did he normally keep her chained up in the yard?  Perhaps he might have if he'd known she was out all night gallivanting around with strange men while he busted his ash working night jobs just to keep her in stockings and bon bons...The picture quality, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1), on this Dark Sky Films DVD release looks very sharp, clean, and crisp.  There are some flaws in the print, but nothing extensive or extreme.  The audio comes through most excellent, sound very clear.  As far as extras go, there's a photo gallery featuring about ten publicity shots and English subtitles.  The one aspect I didn't care for about this release was the artwork used on the DVD cover...it's kind of ugly and a poor representation of the film (in my opinion), but it shouldn't keep you from seeing this feature, especially if you're a fan of film noir.Cookieman108",4,"""It was a mixed assortment of the mild and the defiant.""",1149120000,"06 1, 2006",2006,7074,"['Being', 'woefully',

909598,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B0009OL8IK,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[12, 15]","This is not bad for a 1952 noir, but is not as substantial as other films of the same year--I'm particularly thinking of Narrow Margin with the great Marie Windsor, and especially of the similarly-themed film The Sniper, also about a serial killer.A big part of the reason for the three stars rather than four or five is the acting and the script, both of which are, for the most part, straightforward and pedestrian with a few flashes here and there of smarts. But you do have the by then standard ""stentorian voice"" of a voiceover narrator intoning the details of how the cops follow up leads to catch the killers. You do have the lab guys, complete with glasses and their, you know, ""quirky ways"" that include drinking tea out of a beaker and subtly showing up the ""dumb street cops"" how smart they (the lab guys) are and how unsmart the cops are. And of course you do have the innocent female victim, in the form of the daughter of a semi-crusty older guy who loves his daughter, blah, blah.On the other hand, you also have something that could make your eyes widen and your jaw drop, if just a little bit, and that is a bad girl who, in so many words, practically begs the killer to let her have it--not meaning murder, but sex. The scene in which the two of them are in her car next to each other is fraught with sexual tension and is way ahead of its time. Not only that, but the obvious equating of sex with death is so ripe in that scene that it says more than anything else in the film does about the killer and why he does what he does. This was a really great scene.Ed Binns is on hand to give the film somewhat more polish; he plays one of the two cops after the killer, Carl Martin, who works as a gardener. Carl's thing is to bump off blondes who are young and good looking. And somehow either he finds the married one, or they find him. The fact that it's never made clear just how he winds up with married blondes points to the psychological undertones used in the story, and that's not at all a bad thing.There are some scenes--or at least lines--here and there, that actually appear to look forward to more contemporary films and they are slightly startling in their modernity. So this is an unusual mixture of the pedestrian and the intelligent. It's definitely of its period and is not at all bad. It's an interesting noir that's at least worth seeing if not owning. If you're a noir fiend like me, you'll want it for your collection. In my estimation, it ranks along with B noirs like Blonde Ice and Quicksand as representative of their period but not in what could be called the ""seminal noirs"" which are films like Out of the Past, Murder My Sweet, Double Indemnity, and Black Angel.Still, it's a solid decent effort.",3,"Decent noir--half smart, half dumb",1130457600,"10 28, 2005",2005,2741,"['not', 'bad', '1952', 'noir', 'not', 'as', 'substantial', 'other', 'films', 'same', 'year', ""'m"", 'particularly', 'thinking', 'Narrow', 'Margin', 'great', 'Marie', 'Windsor', 'especially', 'similarly-themed', 'film', 'Sniper', 'also', 'serial', 'killer.A', 'big', 'part', 'reason', 'three', 'stars', 'rather', 'four', 'five', 'acting', 'script', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'straightforward', 'pedestrian', 'few', 'flashes', 'here', 'there', 'smarts', 'do', 'have', 'then', 'standard', 'stentorian', 'voice', 'voiceover', 'narrator', 'intoning', 'details', 'how', 'cops', 'follow', 'up', 'catch', 'killers', 'do', 'have', 'lab', 'guys', 'complete', 'glasses', 'know', 'quirky', 'ways', 'include', 'drinking', 'tea', 'beaker', 'subtly', 'showing', 'up', 'dumb', 'street', 'cops', 'how', 'smart', 'lab', 'guys', 'are', 'how', 'unsmart', 'cops', 'are', 'course', 'do', 'have', 'innocent', 'female', 'victim', 'form', 'daughter', 'semi-crusty', 'older', 'guy', 'who', 'daughter', 'blah', 'blah.On', 'other', 'hand', 'also', 'have', 'something', 'could', 'make', 'eyes', 'widen', 'jaw', 'drop', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'bad', 'girl', 'who', 'so', 'many', 'words', 'practically', 'killer', 'let', 'have', 'not', 'meaning', 'murder', 'sex', 'scene', 'two', 'are', 'car', 'next', 'other', 'fraught', 'sexual', 'tension', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'Not', 'only', 'obvious', 'equating', 'sex', 'death', 'so', 'ripe', 'scene', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'killer', 'why', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'scene.Ed', 'Binns', 'hand', 'give', 'film', 'somewhat', 'more', 'polish', 'one', 'two', 'cops', 'killer', 'Carl', 'Martin', 'who', 'gardener', 'Carl', 'thing', 'bump', 'off', 'blondes', 'who', 'are', 'young', 'good', 'looking', 'somehow', 'either', 'married', 'one', 'find', 'fact', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'just', 'how', 'up', 'married', 'blondes', 'points', 'psychological', 'undertones', 'used', 'story', 'not', 'bad', 'are', 'scenes', 'least', 'lines', 'here', 'there', 'actually', 'appear', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'contemporary', 'films', 'are', 'slightly', 'startling', 'modernity', 'unusual', 'mixture', 'pedestrian', 'intelligent', 'definitely', 'period', 'not', 'bad', 'interesting', 'noir', 'least', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'owning', ""'re"", 'noir', 'fiend', ""'ll"", 'want', 'collection', 'estimation', 'B', 'noirs', 'Blonde', 'Ice', 'Quicksand', 'representative', 'period', 'not', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'seminal', 'noirs', 'are', 'films', 'Out', 'Past', 'Murder', 'My', 'Sweet', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'Black', 'Angel.Still', 'solid', 'decent', 'effort']",Without Warning

The experience of watching an obscure film like this is greatly enhanced when the picture and sound quality are this good. This DVD deserves a special Film Noir award.As for WITHOUT WARNING itself, it turns out to be well worth the wait for those Noir fans who have long wished they could see this legendary movie. The direction is tight, the acting mostly very good, and the look of the film is priceless because it captures so many LA locations that are no longer in existence, or that have been drastically altered over 50-plus years. On the visual level alone, WITHOUT WARNING is a must-see. For a movie of this length (77 min) and low budget, we get several nicely executed edge-of-your-seat thrills. However, the intelligent sceenplay provides plenty of dramatic interest as well. This is one of many 'police procedural' Noirs, but it's several cuts above most others: the narration is concise and mostly unobtrusive, and the scenes of 1950s-style police forensics are all interesting and even feature a degree of humor from a witty lab technician. Best of all is the intrigue. An early example of a serial killer Noir, WITHOUT WARNING compares favorably with THE SNIPER (from the same period)--in its close observation of a killer at work, interspersed with police attempts to track him down--but it's much less sympathetic to the perpetrator in this case. A movie of this type needs a lead actor who can gain audience interest and hold it. This is the case with THE SNIPER, and it's also true in WITHOUT WARNING. Let's hope Adam Williams is around to see the beautiful DVD issue of his great lead performance as Carl Martin. This is a fully realized characterization: tormented, enraged, clever, and pathetic. Williams makes it all believable, and he is ultimately responsible for making the film work so well.As a supplement, the DVD has a gallery of posters and lobby cards",5,Super DVD of Forgotten Film Noir Gem,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,2017,"['Not', 'only', 'well-made', 'nearly', 'forgotten', 'Film', 'Noir', 'been', 'rescued', 'oblivion', 'MPI', 'have', 'used', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'print', 'experience', 'watching', 'obscure', 'film', 'greatly', 'enhanced', 'when', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'good', 'DVD', 'special', 'Film', 'Noir', 'award.As', 'WITHOUT', 'WARNING', 'out', 'be', 'well', 'wait', 'Noir', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'long', 'wished', 'could', 'see', 'legendary', 'movie', 'direction', 'tight', 'acting', 'mostly', 'very', 'good', 'look', 'film', 'priceless', 'so', 'many', 'LA', 'locations', 'are', 'longer', 'existence', 'have', 'been', 'drastically', 'altered', '50-plus', 'years', 'visual', 'level', 'alone', 'WITHOUT', 'WARNING', 'must-see', 'movie', 'length', '77', 'min', 'low', 'budget', 'get', 'several', 'nicely', 'executed', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'thrills', 'However', 'intelligent', 'sceenplay', 'plenty', 'dramatic', 'interest', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'many', 'procedural', 'Noirs', 'several', 'cuts', 'most', 'others', 'narration', 'concise', 'mostly', 'unobtrusive', 'scenes', '1950s-style', 'police', 'forensics', 'are', 'interesting', 'even', 'feature', 'degree', 'humor', 'witty', 'lab', 'technician', 'Best', 'intrigue', 'early', 'example', 'serial', 'killer', 'Noir', 'WITHOUT', 'WARNING', 'favorably', 'THE', 'SNIPER', 'same', 'period', 'close', 'observation', 'killer', 'work', 'interspersed', 'police', 'attempts', 'track', 'down', 'much', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'perpetrator', 'case', 'movie', 'type', 'lead', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'gain', 'audience', 'interest', 'hold', 'case', 'THE', 'SNIPER', 'also', 'true', 'WITHOUT', 'WARNING', 'Let', 'hope', 'Adam', 'Williams', 'around', 'see', 'beautiful', 'DVD', 'issue', 'great', 'lead', 'performance', 'Carl', 'Martin', 'fully', 'realized', 'characterization', 'tormented', 'enraged', 'clever', 'pathetic', 'Williams', 'believable', 'ultimately', 'responsible', 'making', 'film', 'work', 'so', 'supplement', 'DVD', 'gallery', 'posters', 'lobby', 'cards']",Without Warning
909600,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,B0009OL8IK,Noirdame,"[1, 1]","""In the annals of crime of any great city, there is always one case that for sheer savagery will never be forgotten. No professional criminal could ever match its fury, for it is the record of murder without reason, of fear and of terror of a killer who strikes without warning.""So begins the story of the garden shear wielding love-killer, at large in 1951 Los Angeles, who has a murderous penchant for blondes.Originally released through United Artists, on DVD by Dark Sky Films as part of their ""lost noir"" series, directed by Arnold Laven, this is a little-known gem that I find unique for many reasons, which I will be discussing below.Opening outside a motel with blaring jazz music, the police are investigating the murder of a lovely blonde who was killed by a large pair of gardening shears. It is determined that the woman was in her twenties and married, although her husband is clearly not in the picture. As the cops probe the scene, our love-killer, boyish gardener Carl Martin (Adam Williams, North By Northwest), collapses into bed, awakening the next day to head to a local gardening supply store, where he spots the owner's comely daughter Jane (Meg Randall) who is helping out her dad while her husband is overseas. (And let me just add, there is a little girl, Carmencita, who has the tendency to show up in some of the most inopportune moments for Carl). The police, meanwhile, think that the latest murder is linked to one a month earlier - the similarities are striking. While the authorities do everything and anything they can to stop and identify the murderer (including having pretty blonde decoys accompanied by plainclothed cops in an attempt to lure the psycho into a trap, studying torn fabric from the suit he was wearing at the time of the motel killing), Martin is still able to claim two more victims, but not before the police psychiatrist makes his diagnosis. The love-killer is a less than confidant guy who fell head over heels in love with, and married a woman (you guessed it, a blonde) who left him high and dry for another man. So the women he chooses as victims are prototypes of his ex-wife. Blonde, attractive, married but estranged from their husbands for whatever reason. He was unable to punish his wife so instead he punishes other women. Although Martin does pick up one of the decoys, while driving to an out of the way place, he notices that they're being followed and promptly drops her off - alive - but not before delivering a quick little speech regarding morals. It seems that he may be cunning enough at times to stay one step ahead of the law, but he's bound to be found out or exposed - it's just a question of when and how. By the time the detectives discover Martin's identity and that he is a gardener by profession, it may be too late for Jane, who finds herself alone with Carl as his murderous rage is about to explode - again.Adam Williams spent most of his career in television, and I can't help but think that had he had more film roles, if his portrayal here is any indication, he may have become a star in the Richard Widmark mold. His smile could go from sweet to chilling within seconds, his demeanor and facial expression drastically change just by spotting a gal with blonde tresses or noticing any trace that could lead to his capture. When Carl searches for prey in shady nightclubs, or when he stalks Jane, you can feel his eyes on his targets. When he finally tells Jane that she reminds him of his wife, she (and the viewers) know that it's not a term of endearment. You don't know what will set him off, and that makes for on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense.Without Warning is also a very interesting viewing experience because it introduces some investigative techniques that have become much more prevalent and advanced in recent years - analyzing crime scenes, fabric fibers, cigarette butts, soil and criminal profiling. While not exactly what you'd see on CSI today, the determining of the type of suit the perpetrator was wearing and what motivates him to commit his crimes makes this early 50s noir a cut above the rest that I've seen. Also, Martin seems to get a perverse kick out of reading about his savage mayhem in the papers, and along with his clean-cut, seemingly ""normal"" exterior his inner rage simmers, his murderous intent could explode suddenly or could have him meticulously planning his next move. I couldn't help but think of Ted Bundy in that respect - Martin, like Bundy, seems on the surface to be last person you'd suspect to be capable of such savage killings.Of course, I can't review this film without addressing what critics and fans of the genre have debated - whether Without Warning should be considered film noir or not. And I'm going to answer that as honestly as I can - yes and no. At times, it seems that the movie can't decide what it wants to be - a noir, a detective story, or a documentary-style thriller. It has very strong elements of all three, but I do think that it does earn the title of noir, even if it is missing some of the better known ingredients (femme fatales, hard-boiled detectives), and only a handful of scenes take place at night - which is usually considered a noir staple. The rest of the action (including a dramatic chase as Martin evades police after claiming his third victim, and the climax) takes place in broad daylight. The police detectives, while dedicated to their jobs, seem to be rather average Joes apart from it and there is no insight into their personal lives. Even Martin's primary target, Jane, is a regular gal who just wants to help out her father and innocently bide her time until her husband returns. However I suppose it doesn't matter that Jane is not a two-timing dame, because all attractive blondes of that age are the same in Carl Martin's eyes. The narration is on hand pretty much throughout, giving the story an air of realism.The DVD transfer looks very good, crisp and clear for the most part, although one of the night time sequences shows some specks in the top corners. English subtitles are provided on the disc menu along with a photo gallery of lobby cards. The cover art (taken from one of the original posters) and the synopsis on the reverse side of the case made me think of the detective magazines of the era (which I was lucky enough to find in flea markets and/or second-hand stores).In conclusion, Dark Sky films did an excellent job in restoring and making this ""lost noir"" available.
