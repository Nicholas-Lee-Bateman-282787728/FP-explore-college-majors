Themes of incest, bisexuality, rape, lesbianism and May-December romances aside, this totally fails to capture the John Irving novel on which it was based. Jodie Foster, Natasha Kinski and, especially, Rob Lowe, are all way too inexperienced as actors to make this complicated farce even begin to work. Lowe was so pretty, with his rosy cheeks, but his acting was lousy here. Are we supposed to believe that Beau Bridges, who looks about 35, was the father of Lowe and Foster here? I did not.

581599,A27MSJH4529GRK,B00005BKZH,Captain Cook,"[8, 11]","Verdict first - What a load of (...)! And why should I bother to explain this? Nothing in this this movie is explained to me. But I will anyway.This is supposed to be an adaptation of the John Irving novel of the same name. But if you call pushing the 10 most individually photogenic pieces from a 1000-piece jigsaw into a loose assemblage an adaption, then you'll call Natasha Kinski in a bear suit a grizzly.This movie would have done much better to focus on one character, one relationship, or one section of the novel. This would have allowed the makers the chance to develop some depth or at least explain the events that barge erratically and irritatingly past us.As it is, nothing is explained. In an early rape scene involving Jodie Foster's character (of course), her brother manages to find a group of ""coloreds"" to belatedly rescue her. Where they come from in this rural, white, middle-class, New England environment is not explained, nor is it explained why they agree to get involved.After a few more disjointed scenes, the whole family decides to migrate to Vienna. As the movie doesn't bother to explian why, those who haven't read Irvings novl are left to conclude that they must have some kind of 'homing instinct' for this European capital.The psychology behind ""Susie the Bear"" is also skimped on; Lili's suicide is pointlessly included with her ""passing through an open window"" merely after being asked a tough question by a book reviewer; the Vienna radicals and prostitutes are only afforded comic cut-out status; and the incest between the brother and sister ends up being presented like a cartoon caper.Everywhere in this overloaded little film, eccentric facade triumphs over the intriguing insights into the strange and comic events of life that we usually get in John Irving novels.Obviously what's wrong with this film - apart from an over-young cast who aren't capable of keeping the hurly-burly circus of odd scenes and characters believable - is the whole notion of capitaliizing on a popular novel. Cinema and writing are different media. A novel can revel in a great web of causation, whereas a movie is better at capturing the subtleties of the moment.By using the novel's title, the filmmakers believe they have an obligation to touch on every character and event in the original novel with a crude disregard for artistic unity, resulting in a travesty for which the director should be thrown through an open window.

That description, however, gives this flick too much credit.  Mostly this is just a terrible film -- badly written, uninvolving and lurching about without apparent purpose, and without an emotional center.  An incestual relationship between brother and sister, amid a wacky, unconventional family is supposed to somehow elicit our sympathies -- but its execution is as flat an unbelievable as the rest of the film.  The cast, however, has some nice celeb-spotting eye-candy: Jody Foster, Wallace Shawn, and a 9-year old Seth Green.  Rob Lowe is the movie's sole saving grace... As the perv-bound sibling, he was certainly breaking out of his brat pack bimbo typecasting; it's fascinating to see him working on the quirks and mannerisms he later built into a solid acting style.  And at age 19, he's pretty hunky... easy on the eyes.  But other than a chance to see a bunch of famous folks at an odd moment in their careers, this film is a total waste of time.

581604,AYMPVLWFKTAYE,B00005BKZH,"Erin K. Darling ""naive cynic""","[4, 6]","""The Hotel New Hampshire"" is a very pretty movie with a strong cast, good direction and interesting ideas - so why does it fail to be a great film? Largely because as it stands, it's very disjointed; it appears that the screenwriters took only small snips from the book without bothering to segue from one development to the next, leaving the viewer who hasn't read the novel to flounder in bewilderment.In a nutshell, we view the family through Rob Lowe's character's eyes, as he tells us about their struggles over the years. While the story focuses on John (Lowe) and Frannie (Foster,) everyone has an important part to play. The family faces trial after trial, from death to rape to incest to relocating themselves to another continent, but their ties to each other keep them strong. That is, most of the time: There are moments and actions when suddenly the family can't keep itself cohesive, with disastrous results that are only barely explained. It seems everyone is looking for something bigger, better and *more*, but they cannot seem to find it, either within themselves or without. John tells the story in a very matter-of-fact way, without casting blame or judgment on anyone for their thoughts or behaviors, even though some would find room for condemnation. He seems to be saying ""Folks are folks, and sometimes behave in unusual extreme ways; but that doesn't mean they're bad people, or without feeling.""However, motives are usually not clear; characters act completely out of character for no imaginable reason, on small and grand scales, leading to large developments which have no foundation. Rob Lowe and Jodie Foster perform very well, especially given their age and experience in 1984, and they actually do a good job with what they're given. Paul McCrane's character could have been much more interesting, but he is relegated almost to cameo status, and we're never quite sure why he and Seth Green's character are so obsessed with Sorrow, the family's unfortunate dog (and the basic underlying theme to the entire story.)There are some very warm and funny moments in the film, as well as a couple of poignant ones - but we don't know or care about the characters well enough to truly feel their pain when someone important to them passes away. The audience is left with far more questions than answers, when it all comes right down to it.It's not a bad movie on it's own, but neither is it *good*.",3,Those of us who haven't read the book will flounder,1038960000,"12 4, 2002",2002,2422,"['Hotel', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'very', 'pretty', 'movie', 'strong', 'cast', 'good', 'direction', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'so', 'why', 'fail', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'Largely', 'very', 'disjointed', 'screenwriters', 'took', 'only', 'small', 'snips', 'book', 'bothering', 'segue', 'one', 'development', 'next', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'who', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'flounder', 'bewilderment.In', 'nutshell', 'view', 'family', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'character', 'eyes', 'struggles', 'years', 'story', 'John', 'Lowe', 'Frannie', 'Foster', 'everyone', 'important', 'part', 'play', 'family', 'trial', 'trial', 'death', 'rape', 'incest', 'relocating', 'continent', 'ties', 'other', 'keep', 'strong', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'moments', 'actions', 'when', 'suddenly', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'cohesive', 'disastrous', 'results', 'are', 'only', 'barely', 'explained', 'everyone', 'looking', 'something', 'bigger', 'better', '*more*', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'find', 'either', 'John', 'story', 'very', 'matter-of-fact', 'way', 'casting', 'blame', 'judgment', 'anyone', 'thoughts', 'behaviors', 'even', 'would', 'find', 'room', 'condemnation', 'be', 'saying', 'Folks', 'are', 'folks', 'sometimes', 'behave', 'unusual', 'extreme', 'ways', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'re"", 'bad', 'people', 'feeling', 'However', 'motives', 'are', 'usually', 'not', 'clear', 'characters', 'act', 'completely', 'character', 'imaginable', 'reason', 'small', 'grand', 'scales', 'leading', 'large', 'developments', 'have', 'foundation', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'perform', 'very', 'well', 'especially', 'given', 'age', 'experience', '1984', 'actually', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'what', ""'re"", 'given', 'Paul', 'McCrane', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'relegated', 'almost', 'cameo', 'status', ""'re"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'Seth', 'Green', 'character', 'are', 'so', 'obsessed', 'Sorrow', 'family', 'unfortunate', 'dog', 'basic', 'underlying', 'theme', 'entire', 'story', 'are', 'very', 'warm', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'poignant', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'care', 'characters', 'well', 'enough', 'truly', 'feel', 'pain', 'when', 'someone', 'important', 'away', 'audience', 'left', 'far', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'when', 'right', 'down', 'it.It', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'own', '*good*']",The Hotel New Hampshire

The Hotel New Hampshire is about another offbeat family.  This time the Berry's are examined.  Father - Winn and Mother - Betty (Beau Bridges and Lisa Banes) met while working at the Hotel New Hampshire.  The had five children - Frank (Paul McCrane), Franny (Jodie Foster), Johnny (Rob Lowe), Lilly (Jennie Dundas) and Egg (a very young Seth Green).Win works as a teacher at Dairy private school where his father, Iowa Bob (Wilford Brimley), is the coach.  But Win and Betty want to recapture their youth and open a hotel (and name it after the hotel where they met.)  They buy an abandoned girls school near Dairy school.  They convert it and open it.  Just as they are all misfits, their clientele are also misfits.  They get an invitation to open another hotel in Vienna.  And they do the same.This film is not about story, it is about characters.  This film serves you a wide variety of characters from the lovely Anita Morris as the oversexed waitress to Natasha Kinski as a woman who hides in a bear suit.  And of course, Wallace Shawn as Freud.Each of the four stars, Foster, Lowe, Bridges and Kinski, had their careers in transition.  They were looking for the breakout hit to take their career to the next level.  This film was widely admired but not a box office smash.  Foster would only have to wait a couple of years (The Accused).  Lowe would have to wait fourteen years to achieve success in The West Wing.

581608,AZGQV8SQLULCI,B00005BKZH,M.W. Thrasher,"[2, 2]","If you have not read the book, then this movie may intrigue you. It is quirky and interesting to say the least. As a storyline it does not lack imagination. From Maine to Vienna to NYC and back to Maine, from the Jew-hating German tourists to the radicals and the [...], from one Hotel New Hampshire to another, the dreams of a father and his colourful family unfold in a series of bizarre and at times disturbing events. And life appears to be a fairy tale that we live as we chase our dreams.Now, in relation to the actual book, this movie can be described with just one word: RUSHED. The adaptation is so faithful that it tries to cover almost everything, all characters and all events, thereby failing miserably to project the sentiment behind the eccentric story of this highly unusual family. I could go on and on about how the accurate quotes from the original text fall flat on a screenplay that comes across truncated and patched together clumsily, how the scenes lack emotional depth, how the characters are not given enough time to be adequately developed... but I will instead characterise the whole attempt as noble but short. If the book was a long wave-like function, with a rise to a crest, then a drop followed by a building surge and another rise to another crest, over and over and over again, then the movie was just a cross-section of the top parts of this rollercoaster of a wave-like function, shaving off all the crests and placing them in a two hour blender, where they were shaken and served to please God knows what. Surely not the potential of this fascinatingly bizarre book, nor its undercurrent and extremely subtle magical tone. And it was not for lack of effort. It was for lack of realism on how to put on screen a highly bizzare story in a way that flows smoothly rather than jump spastically between scenes. A mini series would have worked much better for such a faithful adaptation. Either that or a more free-flowing interpretation that could possibly make sense within the 120 minutes that are usually allocated to a motion picture.Thank God for Jodie Foster's and Beau Bridges's performances, who bring Fanny and Win Berry to life. Keep passing the open windows and read the book for a much richer and meaningful experience. As far as this movie is concerned, just toss it out as far as you can. And if you are to keep it, then do so to remind yourselves of how to NOT adapt a great book onto the screen.

But this one, which is more like putting pieces from the book one after another is so perfectly crafted by Tony Richardson, and a faultless casting, that it fully convey the spirit of the writing, much more than &quot;world according to Garp&quot; or &quot;Cider House Rules&quot;.

I haven'tread, (and now, would probably decline to ever read) the originalmanuscript or novel, but, most would probably give the benefit ofthe doubt to the underlying book author.In terms of movie, though, there's indubitably no redeeming value toit, as it's a unrelenting, spastic sequence of absurd, tasteless,unnecessary, unsavory moments, involving taboo after taboo,intermixed with a sugar coating, to perhaps confusem, fool andmesmerize the censors or movie rating authorities.The sugar coating of the taboos, might perhaps make palatable theunderlying sequences to those with a low IQ, or perhaps to children,but for all others, including teenagers, or seniors or those with awicked sense of humor, there's really no coherent story progressingover the  90 mins.As such, and the best remedy is really the fast forward button onthe DVD player, or, if you prefer (as was the case, in the 80's whenthis work was released), getting up from your chair, and walking outof the theatre.",1,"Unrelenting, spastic sequence of absurd, tasteless,unsavory moments",1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,1995,"['HOTEL', 'NEW', 'HAMPSHIRE', '1984', 'theory', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'afascinating', 'exciting', 'movie', 'lot', 'crowd-drawing', 'power', 'all-star', 'cast', 'made', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Nastassja', 'Kinski', 'RobLowe', 'more', 'prime', 'aged', '20', '30', 'years', 'thetime.Unfortunately', 'picture', 'was', 'written', '1', '3', 'possible', 'ways', 'someone', 'who', 'adapted', 'painting', 'technique', 'throwing', 'buckets', 'ofpaint', 'canvas', 'calling', 'painter', 'result', 'apainting', 'movies', 'someone', 'mental', 'age', '10', 'orsomeone', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'totally', 'lost', 'mind', 'lost', 'touchwith', 'reality', 'present', 'past.Of', 'course', 'treat', 'see', 'Foster', 'Kinski', 'Lowe', 'action', 'asthey', 'are', 'truly', 'talented', 'bringing', 'forth', 'subtle', 'humanundercurrents', 'visual', 'expressions', 'camera', 'audience.But', 'work', 'apparently', 'carry', 'silver', 'screen', 'anovel', 'style', 'Kurt', 'Vonnegut', 'example', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'who', 'wrote', 'Hitchiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'others', ""haven'tread"", 'now', 'would', 'probably', 'decline', 'ever', 'read', 'originalmanuscript', 'novel', 'most', 'would', 'probably', 'give', 'benefit', 'ofthe', 'doubt', 'underlying', 'book', 'author.In', 'terms', 'movie', 'though', 'indubitably', 'redeeming', 'value', 'toit', 'unrelenting', 'spastic', 'sequence', 'absurd', 'tasteless', 'unnecessary', 'unsavory', 'moments', 'involving', 'taboo', 'taboo', 'intermixed', 'sugar', 'coating', 'perhaps', 'confusem', 'fool', 'andmesmerize', 'censors', 'movie', 'rating', 'authorities.The', 'sugar', 'coating', 'taboos', 'might', 'perhaps', 'make', 'palatable', 'theunderlying', 'sequences', 'low', 'IQ', 'perhaps', 'children', 'others', 'including', 'teenagers', 'seniors', 'awicked', 'sense', 'humor', 'really', 'coherent', 'story', '90', 'mins.As', 'such', 'best', 'remedy', 'really', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'onthe', 'DVD', 'player', 'prefer', 'was', 'case', '80', 'whenthis', 'work', 'was', 'released', 'getting', 'up', 'chair', 'walking', 'outof', 'theatre']",The Hotel New Hampshire
581611,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005BKZH,Reviewer,"[21, 23]","This is a story about life and the many facets of love, dreams and aspirations, and the journey of discovery we all have to make in our own way in our own time.  But the single thread that runs through the film and ties the characters and their lives together is sorrow; and in this instance, using an extremely overt metaphor, ""Sorrow"" is the family pet-- a dog-- who comes to symbolize a seemingly prevalent condition of the Berry family in ""The Hotel New Hampshire,"" written for the screen and directed by Tony Richardson, adapted from the novel by John Irving.  The story centers on the Berry family, a close but eccentric clan, and is told from the perspective of John (Rob Lowe), who tries to make sense of his too familiar relationship with his sister, Frannie (Jodie Foster), his gay older brother, Frank (Paul McCrane), his literally ""little"" sister, Lilly (Jennifer Dundas) who ""isn't a midget,"" but who stopped growing too soon, the youngest of the bunch, Egg (Seth Green), his grandfather, Iowa Bob (Wilford Brimley) and his parents (Beau Bridges and Lisa Banes).John's father, Win, was a dreamer, or as Lilly called him, a ""Gatsby,"" always looking for something better, for ""it.""  Win and Mother Berry had met one summer working together at a hotel, and when Win tires of his job as a school teacher, he decides their town needs a hotel.  So he buys an abandoned building that suits his needs perfectly, and transforms it into a hotel, the Hotel New Hampshire, owned and operated by the entire Berry family.  And it is here that the memories of his formative years are made for John; memories like struggling with his love for his sister while she lives through a particularly traumatic experience that involves a boy of whom she is enamored, Chip Dove (Matthew Modine), and tasting love himself for the first time with a waitress at the hotel (Joely Richardson).  It is also at this time that he experiences a death in the family for the first time.  And, as it is in life, it won't be the last; nor will it be his final encounter with tragedy and sorrow.In this film, Richardson touches upon a number of themes that at one time (and not that long ago) would have been considered taboo in a film:  Homosexuality, incest and interracial relationships.  And he does it successfully by weaving them into the story naturally and objectively, without expounding upon or exploring them simply to enhance the drama.  This is simply the story of the Berry family, for better or worse, with John telling it like it is while refraining from any sensationalism or judgment calls, to which the likes of a film of this nature would ordinarily be disposed.Lowe gives a convincing performance as John-- arguably some of the best work he's ever done-- and he underscores his role of narrator by making the story as much about the others as about himself, which is generous, and a good piece of acting.  Foster, who would've been twenty-one or twenty-two when this was filmed (1984), displays an insight, poise and maturity well beyond her years, with a performance that is intuitively discerning and believable, and which serves the character so well while bringing her vividly to life.  There is such a natural quality to Foster's acting that it makes her a joy to watch, and it makes Frannie a memorable character.  The young Dundas is also very impressive in the role of Lilly and, like Foster, manages to bring the necessary maturity to the character that makes her entirely credible.The supporting cast includes Wallace Shawn (Freud), Dorsey Wright (Junior), Cali Timmins (Bitty), Anita Morris (Ronda Ray) and Walter Massey (Texan).  The film is by turns poignant, funny and disturbing; one could say a succinct reflection of life.  And, diverse as this story is, thematically, there will undoubtedly be one aspect of it or another to which just about anyone will be able to relate.  Because that's what life is; a journey we all share, but which we take on different roads that sooner or later are bound to intersect, and which becomes the point at which we realize something that's inescapable and possibly the most important thing we will ever learn:  That we are not alone in this.  And, in the final analysis, that is what ""The Hotel New Hampshire"" is all about.  And that's the magic of the movies.",3,A Part of the Journey,995414400,"07 18, 2001",2001,4307,"['story', 'life', 'many', 'facets', 'love', 'dreams', 'aspirations', 'journey', 'discovery', 'have', 'make', 'own', 'way', 'own', 'time', 'single', 'thread', 'film', 'characters', 'lives', 'together', 'sorrow', 'instance', 'using', 'extremely', 'overt', 'metaphor', 'Sorrow', 'family', 'pet', 'dog', 'who', 'symbolize', 'seemingly', 'prevalent', 'condition', 'Berry', 'family', 'Hotel', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'written', 'screen', 'directed', 'Tony', 'Richardson', 'adapted', 'novel', 'John', 'Irving', 'story', 'centers', 'Berry', 'family', 'close', 'eccentric', 'clan', 'told', 'perspective', 'John', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'who', 'make', 'sense', 'too', 'familiar', 'relationship', 'sister', 'Frannie', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'gay', 'older', 'brother', 'Frank', 'Paul', 'McCrane', 'literally', 'little', 'sister', 'Lilly', 'Jennifer', 'Dundas', 'who', ""n't"", 'midget', 'who', 'stopped', 'growing', 'too', 'soon', 'youngest', 'bunch', 'Egg', 'Seth', 'Green', 'grandfather', 'Iowa', 'Bob', 'Wilford', 'Brimley', 'parents', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Lisa', 'Banes', '.John', 'father', 'Win', 'was', 'dreamer', 'Lilly', 'called', 'Gatsby', 'always', 'looking', 'something', 'better', 'Win', 'Mother', 'Berry', 'had', 'met', 'one', 'summer', 'working', 'together', 'hotel', 'when', 'Win', 'tires', 'job', 'school', 'teacher', 'town', 'hotel', 'abandoned', 'building', 'suits', 'needs', 'perfectly', 'hotel', 'Hotel', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'owned', 'operated', 'entire', 'Berry', 'family', 'here', 'memories', 'formative', 'years', 'are', 'made', 'John', 'memories', 'struggling', 'love', 'sister', 'particularly', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'boy', 'whom', 'enamored', 'Chip', 'Dove', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'tasting', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'waitress', 'hotel', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'also', 'time', 'death', 'family', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'last', 'will', 'be', 'final', 'encounter', 'tragedy', 'sorrow.In', 'film', 'Richardson', 'number', 'themes', 'one', 'time', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'taboo', 'film', 'Homosexuality', 'incest', 'interracial', 'relationships', 'successfully', 'weaving', 'story', 'naturally', 'objectively', 'expounding', 'upon', 'exploring', 'simply', 'enhance', 'drama', 'simply', 'story', 'Berry', 'family', 'better', 'worse', 'John', 'telling', 'refraining', 'sensationalism', 'judgment', 'calls', 'likes', 'film', 'nature', 'would', 'ordinarily', 'be', 'disposed.Lowe', 'convincing', 'performance', 'John', 'arguably', 'best', 'work', 'ever', 'done', 'role', 'narrator', 'making', 'story', 'much', 'others', 'generous', 'good', 'piece', 'acting', 'Foster', 'who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'twenty-one', 'twenty-two', 'when', 'was', 'filmed', '1984', 'insight', 'poise', 'maturity', 'well', 'years', 'performance', 'intuitively', 'discerning', 'believable', 'character', 'so', 'well', 'bringing', 'vividly', 'life', 'natural', 'quality', 'Foster', 'acting', 'joy', 'watch', 'Frannie', 'memorable', 'character', 'young', 'Dundas', 'also', 'very', 'impressive', 'role', 'Lilly', 'Foster', 'bring', 'necessary', 'maturity', 'character', 'entirely', 'credible.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'Freud', 'Dorsey', 'Wright', 'Junior', 'Cali', 'Timmins', 'Bitty', 'Anita', 'Morris', 'Ronda', 'Ray', 'Walter', 'Massey', 'Texan', 'film', 'turns', 'poignant', 'funny', 'disturbing', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'succinct', 'reflection', 'life', 'diverse', 'story', 'thematically', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'one', 'aspect', 'just', 'anyone', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'what', 'life', 'journey', 'share', 'take', 'different', 'roads', 'sooner', 'later', 'are', 'bound', 'intersect', 'point', 'realize', 'something', 'inescapable', 'possibly', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'will', 'ever', 'learn', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'final', 'analysis', 'what', 'Hotel', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'magic', 'movies']",The Hotel New Hampshire

(Not surprisingly, Irving's books were not truly successful as films until Irving himself adapted The Cider House Rules, although some viewers will prefer The World According to Garp.)Here, Richardson distills the essence of Irving but misses the author's dominant themes; the result is a film that follows Irving closely and understands its characters without ever giving them complete and coherent personalities. Without that essential ingredient, this film--about the exploits of a highly eccentric and dysfunctional family--grows thin and repetitious. We're left to enjoy the quirks of a fine ensemble cast, and the resilience of a family that has learned to survive by ""passing open windows"" (in other words, avoiding suicide no matter how tempting).Beau Bridges is the Berry family patriarch and resident free spirit of the Hotel New Hampshire, where his children thrive on liberal parenting, a parade of unusual patrons, and their own lust for life, love, and--in the case of incestuous siblings John (Rob Lowe) and Frannie (Jodie Foster)--each other.Their coming-of-age tales are often a joy to behold, and Richardson draws some excellent performances from his young, stellar cast. What's missing here is a sense of deeper meaning and resonance; the film seems oddly random, while Irving's book clearly conveys an affectionate fascination with the tenacity of the human spirit.From Academy Award-winning* director Tony Richardson (Tom Jones) comes this ""bright, amusing and provocative"" (The Hollywood Reporter) film based on John Irving's best-selling novel. Featuring ""a gifted cast"", including Oscar winner Jodie Foster (The Silence of the Lambs), Rob Lowe (""The West Wing"") and Beau Bridges (The Fabulous Baker Boys), The Hotel New Hampshire is ""intriguing"" (Boxoffice), ""impressive"" and ""fascinating""!A motley clan of eight lovable misfits, the Berry family sets out on an adventure to fulfill their father's lifelong aspiration of owning a hotel. Their quest takes them around the world, and they greet every new location with their own brand of outrageous humor, practical jokes and just plain weird eccentricism. But when this tribe of oddballs encounters a healthy dose of heartbreak, they soon must learn that not all in life is fun and games and that sometimes the only thing you have left is the one thing that matters most family. *1963: Best Picture, Director **1991: Actress, The Silence of the Lambs; 1988: Actress, The AccusedThis comedy flick also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 11 going on 12 years old in the 5th grade during its theatrical release in the Spring of 1984.",3,Every Teenage Boys Fantasy,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,2772,"['Tony', 'Richardson', 'adaptation', 'THE', 'HOTEL', 'NEW', 'HAMPSHIRE', 'unique', 'qualities', 'John', 'Irving', 'fiction', 'are', 'accessible', 'print', 'elusive', 'screen', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'Irving', 'books', 'were', 'not', 'truly', 'successful', 'films', 'Irving', 'adapted', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'viewers', 'will', 'prefer', 'World', 'According', 'Garp', 'Here', 'Richardson', 'essence', 'Irving', 'author', 'dominant', 'themes', 'result', 'film', 'Irving', 'closely', 'characters', 'ever', 'giving', 'complete', 'coherent', 'personalities', 'essential', 'ingredient', 'film', 'exploits', 'highly', 'eccentric', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'grows', 'thin', 'repetitious', ""'re"", 'left', 'enjoy', 'quirks', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'resilience', 'family', 'learned', 'survive', 'passing', 'open', 'windows', 'other', 'words', 'avoiding', 'suicide', 'matter', 'how', 'tempting', '.Beau', 'Bridges', 'Berry', 'family', 'patriarch', 'resident', 'free', 'spirit', 'Hotel', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'where', 'children', 'thrive', 'liberal', 'parenting', 'parade', 'unusual', 'patrons', 'own', 'lust', 'life', 'love', 'case', 'incestuous', 'siblings', 'John', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Frannie', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'other.Their', 'coming-of-age', 'tales', 'are', 'often', 'joy', 'behold', 'Richardson', 'excellent', 'performances', 'young', 'stellar', 'cast', 'What', 'missing', 'here', 'sense', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'resonance', 'film', 'oddly', 'random', 'Irving', 'book', 'clearly', 'conveys', 'affectionate', 'fascination', 'tenacity', 'human', 'spirit.From', 'Academy', 'Award-winning*', 'director', 'Tony', 'Richardson', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'bright', 'amusing', 'provocative', 'Hollywood', 'Reporter', 'film', 'based', 'John', 'Irving', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'Featuring', 'gifted', 'cast', 'including', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'West', 'Wing', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Fabulous', 'Baker', 'Boys', 'Hotel', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'intriguing', 'Boxoffice', 'impressive', 'fascinating', 'motley', 'clan', 'eight', 'lovable', 'misfits', 'Berry', 'family', 'out', 'adventure', 'fulfill', 'father', 'lifelong', 'aspiration', 'owning', 'hotel', 'quest', 'world', 'greet', 'new', 'location', 'own', 'brand', 'outrageous', 'humor', 'practical', 'jokes', 'just', 'plain', 'weird', 'eccentricism', 'when', 'tribe', 'oddballs', 'encounters', 'healthy', 'dose', 'heartbreak', 'soon', 'must', 'learn', 'not', 'life', 'fun', 'games', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'left', 'one', 'thing', 'most', 'family', '*1963', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Director', '**1991', 'Actress', 'Silence', 'Lambs', '1988', 'Actress', 'AccusedThis', 'comedy', 'flick', 'also', 'back', 'memory', 'lane', 'when', 'was', '11', 'going', '12', 'years', 'old', '5th', 'grade', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Spring', '1984']",The Hotel New Hampshire

I thought it was horrible.  When they made a movie, I went to the theatre in the off-chance that they managed to make a good movie from a lame book (it's possible).No.  THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSIRE is also pretty horrible.The characters are quirky for the sake of quirky.  I never believed them.  They work so hard to be cute and unconventional that they're completely smug and obnoxious, draining all sympathy for them.  Stylistically, it's just confusing.  When Rob Lowe zips over to bed his foul-mouthed sister Jodie Foster, I had to wonder what the filmmakers were shooting for.  Slapstick incest?I didn't read John Irving for years because, after this, I thought he'd shot his wad with GARP and was just writing the same story over and over.",1,Garp Lite,1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,866,"['loved', 'book', 'film', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'ACCORDING', 'TO', 'GARP', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Then', 'read', 'HOTEL', 'NEW', 'HAMPSHIRE', 'thought', 'was', 'horrible', 'When', 'made', 'movie', 'went', 'theatre', 'off-chance', 'managed', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'lame', 'book', 'possible', '.No', 'THE', 'HOTEL', 'NEW', 'HAMPSIRE', 'also', 'pretty', 'horrible.The', 'characters', 'are', 'quirky', 'sake', 'quirky', 'never', 'believed', 'work', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'cute', 'unconventional', ""'re"", 'completely', 'smug', 'obnoxious', 'draining', 'sympathy', 'Stylistically', 'just', 'confusing', 'When', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'bed', 'foul-mouthed', 'sister', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'had', 'wonder', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'shooting', 'Slapstick', 'incest', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'John', 'Irving', 'years', 'because', 'thought', ""'d"", 'shot', 'wad', 'GARP', 'was', 'just', 'writing', 'same', 'story']",The Hotel New Hampshire
581615,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00005BKZH,Westley,"[5, 9]","This movie is quite odd, but never boring.  I didn't read the John Irving book from which it was adapted, but I can guess that, as is typical of the author, the book must juggle a multitude of characters and sub-plots.  Unfortunately, it really doesn't work as a movie and ends up feeling like a series of loosely connected vignettes.  The plot speeds along much too quickly and characters appear and disappear without much reason.  The movie does, however, have a few positive points...First, the cast is first-rate and Rob Lowe has one of his most unusual roles (this was his third movie after ""The Outsiders"" and ""Class""), as a confused young man lusting after his sister (Jodie Foster, who's ok).  Paul McCrane (ER's Dr. Romano) has one of his few relatively large film roles.  The movie looks great, with beautiful location shooting with Canada substituting for New Hampshire and Vienna.  Finally, this is probably the only place you can see Matthew Modine being raped by a person in a bear suit.  Overall, a very strange journey that makes little sense and doesn't bear up to much scrutiny.
