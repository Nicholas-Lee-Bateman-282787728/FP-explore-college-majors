I found some characters (Lola) a bit shallow, but the Mexican mother is truer than life.Too many coincidences in the plot may make the movie seem somewhat unrealistic at times.The end is filled with emotion.",3,The bitter-sweet American dream,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,425,"['movie', 'many', 'topics', 'too', 'many', 'cultural', 'gap', 'second', 'first', 'generation', 'Mexicans', 'difficulty', 'hostility', 'loneliness', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'face', 'issue', 'debasing', 'others', 'found', 'characters', 'Lola', 'bit', 'shallow', 'Mexican', 'mother', 'truer', 'life.Too', 'many', 'coincidences', 'plot', 'may', 'make', 'movie', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'unrealistic', 'times.The', 'end', 'filled', 'emotion']",N/A

There is quite a bit of sexuality. The story line is not appropriate for classroom use. Kuno Becker should have passed this role up. He is so much better in Novelas.,1,Not for classroom use!,1369267200,"05 23, 2013",2013,307,"['Bought', 'movie', 'Spanish', 'classes', 'Glad', 'previewed', 'first', 'one', 'movie', 'will', 'land', 'trouble', 'definately', 'R', 'rating', 'quite', 'bit', 'sexuality', 'story', 'line', 'not', 'appropriate', 'classroom', 'use', 'Kuno', 'Becker', 'should', 'have', 'passed', 'role', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Novelas']",N/A
1105245,A27W5AJNP6YX7Z,B000VXUW0E,"Ivy Bewley ""Hiedra""","[7, 7]","I wouldn't guess that this movie was done by anyone who wanted to argue for immigrant reform in this country. I found it difficult to sympathize with any of the characters. Lots of people did drugs. The native-born girl took everything for granted, was rude to her parents, and slept around. The guy, at only 21, was already married with a kid and thought he needed to get a job as an exotic dancer to support himself. Sure, it pays a lot more than McDonald's and he could bring his family over sooner. But what did he think he was doing, making out with the women who were paying to watch him dance privately? I really don't think that was part of his job description. After all, I didn't see him climbing all over the middle-aged chubby woman. Just the hot young ones. I wanted to punch him in the face and remind him he was married and supposedly cared about his family. Would his wife want the money if she knew where he was getting it? For this reason, I could not feel any sympathy for him after the incident with the men, especially since they didn't even show us exactly what happened. I kind of just assumed he overreacted and he had it coming. The only person in the movie who seemed at all honorable was the ESL teacher. Many of the students in the class seemed nice as well, but then we never learned anything about any of them.I was interested in this movie because I was a Spanish major in school and I thought the dual language format would be interesting. It was. And it was well-acted and kept my interest. But for the most part it was just scuzzy.",3,Que Asco!,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,1565,"['would', ""n't"", 'guess', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'anyone', 'who', 'wanted', 'argue', 'immigrant', 'reform', 'country', 'found', 'difficult', 'sympathize', 'characters', 'Lots', 'people', 'did', 'drugs', 'native-born', 'girl', 'took', 'everything', 'granted', 'was', 'rude', 'parents', 'slept', 'around', 'guy', 'only', '21', 'was', 'already', 'married', 'kid', 'thought', 'needed', 'get', 'job', 'exotic', 'dancer', 'support', 'Sure', 'lot', 'more', 'McDonald', 'could', 'bring', 'family', 'sooner', 'what', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'doing', 'making', 'out', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'paying', 'watch', 'dance', 'privately', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'part', 'job', 'description', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'climbing', 'middle-aged', 'chubby', 'woman', 'Just', 'hot', 'young', 'ones', 'wanted', 'punch', 'face', 'remind', 'was', 'married', 'supposedly', 'cared', 'family', 'Would', 'wife', 'want', 'money', 'knew', 'where', 'was', 'getting', 'reason', 'could', 'not', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'incident', 'men', 'especially', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'kind', 'just', 'assumed', 'overreacted', 'had', 'coming', 'only', 'person', 'movie', 'who', 'seemed', 'honorable', 'was', 'ESL', 'teacher', 'Many', 'students', 'class', 'seemed', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'then', 'never', 'learned', 'anything', 'them.I', 'was', 'interested', 'movie', 'was', 'Spanish', 'major', 'school', 'thought', 'dual', 'language', 'format', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'was', 'was', 'well-acted', 'kept', 'interest', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'just', 'scuzzy']",N/A
