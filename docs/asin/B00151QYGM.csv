In this war, it's more than just an existance, the planet has now become the new target for breeding creatures known as venomoids. In order for the venomoids to exist, the human race must not. For the moment it seems like there's nothing to do except fight back, but how ? and with what ? Well the answers has appeared in a form of a teknoman who seems to be hope the human race is looking for. The question now is who will survive and prosper ? Especially when Teknoman has some dark secrets of his own.",5,Tekno Power,1227052800,"11 19, 2008",2008,569,"['Wars', 'always', 'been', 'fought', 'form', 'who', 'will', 'exist', 'longer', 'war', 'more', 'just', 'existance', 'planet', 'now', 'become', 'new', 'target', 'breeding', 'creatures', 'known', 'venomoids', 'order', 'venomoids', 'exist', 'human', 'race', 'must', 'not', 'moment', 'nothing', 'do', 'fight', 'back', 'how', 'what', 'Well', 'answers', 'appeared', 'form', 'teknoman', 'who', 'be', 'human', 'race', 'looking', 'question', 'now', 'who', 'will', 'survive', 'prosper', 'Especially', 'when', 'Teknoman', 'dark', 'secrets', 'own']",Teknoman Complete Collection

There are a total of 43 episodes on six DVDs.  The discs are packed in three lavishly-illustrated keepcases (two discs per case...obviously), which are housed in a spiffy cardboard slipcover.  The packaging looks so cool and the price is so nice that you may have trouble containing your excitement.  But don't get too excited until you've successfully watched the last three episodes on the very first disc.  Maybe you'll be lucky enough to get a rare working copy.  I was not so lucky, so I gave up after my second replacement.  I guess there must be a bad batch of these sets out there that all contain defective disc 1's that freeze and skip after the fourth episode on many (or all) brands of DVD players and cause computers to crash.  So good luck to you if you're buying this potentially-awesome complete Teknoman collection.  If your set is trouble-free, you'll gladly give it five stars.  As for me, I can only give it one.",1,This would be the DVD bargain of the year...if disc 1 played correctly.,1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,1055,"['attractive', 'set', 'three', 'English-only', 'Teknoman', 'collections', 'were', 'previously', 'released', 'separately', 'are', 'total', '43', 'episodes', 'six', 'DVDs', 'discs', 'are', 'packed', 'three', 'lavishly-illustrated', 'keepcases', 'two', 'discs', 'case', 'obviously', 'are', 'housed', 'spiffy', 'cardboard', 'slipcover', 'packaging', 'so', 'cool', 'price', 'so', 'nice', 'may', 'have', 'trouble', 'containing', 'excitement', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'excited', ""'ve"", 'successfully', 'watched', 'last', 'three', 'episodes', 'very', 'first', 'disc', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'be', 'lucky', 'enough', 'get', 'rare', 'working', 'copy', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'lucky', 'gave', 'up', 'second', 'replacement', 'guess', 'must', 'be', 'bad', 'batch', 'sets', 'out', 'there', 'contain', 'defective', 'disc', '1', 'freeze', 'skip', 'fourth', 'episode', 'many', 'brands', 'DVD', 'players', 'cause', 'computers', 'crash', 'So', 'good', 'luck', ""'re"", 'buying', 'potentially-awesome', 'complete', 'Teknoman', 'collection', 'set', 'trouble-free', ""'ll"", 'gladly', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'one']",Teknoman Complete Collection

Around episode 4, the disk glitches and I think this was a manufacturing error in a large portion of the sets. However, the set itself has become somewhat hard to find, and messing 2 or 3 episodes wasn't a big deal to me. I was glad to finally get the chance to see this in it's entirety. When it was on up a lot of episodes and other things were skipped over. It is basically the same version as the aired version except Slade is called Blade(which is correct), Gunnar is Dagger which is correct, and the violence is uncut, but the music and everything else besides the opening is the same. I enjoyed this set, was glad to pick it up a few years ago.",5,"Great, except for the glitch on the first disk",1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,752,"['guess', 'was', 'true', 'what', 'customers', 'said', 'being', 'glitch', 'first', 'disk', 'set', 'episode', '4', 'disk', 'glitches', 'think', 'was', 'manufacturing', 'error', 'large', 'portion', 'sets', 'However', 'set', 'become', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'find', 'messing', '2', '3', 'episodes', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'deal', 'was', 'glad', 'finally', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'entirety', 'When', 'was', 'lot', 'episodes', 'other', 'things', 'were', 'skipped', 'basically', 'same', 'version', 'aired', 'version', 'Slade', 'called', 'Blade', 'correct', 'Gunnar', 'Dagger', 'correct', 'violence', 'uncut', 'music', 'everything', 'else', 'opening', 'same', 'enjoyed', 'set', 'was', 'glad', 'pick', 'up', 'few', 'years', 'ago']",Teknoman Complete Collection

As far as I remember it never completed an entire U.S. run so I was blown away to find out it was on DVD.The show is great, the animation has areas where it drops in quality (as in because of the animators not the DVD encoding)and there was an episode where the dialogue got too quiet but it's an early 90's anime to DVD so not a big deal in my opinion. Just a note, this is the International English dub, not the TV dub, so those like me who saw it when they were kids may notice some dialogue changes.All in all, an entire 6 Disc anime series plus nostalgia for 18$?
