This movie had so many plot holes in it, the draft nearly froze me solid. I haven't one positive thing to say about it. At an hour and 20 minutes, it felt like it was four hours long. Many scenes of people standing around talking - with terrible dialouge. The SFX were just bad. The story was insipid. That's the problem with low budget zombie movies - they usually stink. People get some chumps to put up the dough, then do nothing with it. With a little thought behind it other than ""Oh wow! We're making a movie!"", this might have been nearly worth watching. Instead it was boring, silly and worthless. Just another addition to the crap heap of history. I could go on and add some spoilers, perhaps saving someone from actually buying this (How it even got released to DVD amazes me) but there may be someone out there who actually thinks this is worth seeing.

1097568,APOUYO1BEPK22,B000UYN9NG,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[12, 14]","First I would like to say that I don't care if a movie is low budget or not.`Day X' was nothing you probably haven't seen before. An outbreak occurs and people turn into `zombies'. Later we find out they really aren't zombies, but this is what they are called throughout the movie. I would call them ashen burn victims though since that's what the looked like. Imagine a cartoon character hold a bomb... then the bomb goes off while they are still holding it... now imagine what that cartoon character looks like now. Yep... black and ashy.  When the outbreak occurs we have Frank Chambers, our main character, walking to his car in a parking garage and then he gets attacked by about 50 zombies. He gets away after making it to his car... or maybe it's not his car. I couldn't tell if he was fumbling for keys or hotwiring it while zombies were outside his open window just touching him and not actually pulling him through the window (even though they do this later). The next you thing see is him running around carrying some white girl on his shoulder (where the heck did she come from?).  He makes it to some abandoned warehouse as well as some more people. After getting to know one another Frank Chambers starts to hand out guns and jobs to do. Rescue is on their way because the girl he brought with him is very important... because she's the cure to what's going on outside. When the rescue goes bad, it's up to the remaining survivors to make it the secret government underground bunkers and tunnels that spread through out the country.Now, the movie sounds ok. But the quality of the film, sound, and actors just don't cut it. Everything looks fake and sounds fake. The actors are horrible. Some of them actually look like they are thinking about their lines and actions. Sometimes when they 'huff' because they are mad, it's like they are thinking of the part of the script that says to 'huff and puff cause your mad'.  The story itself isn't extremely bad, but it did feel incomplete. I was left with a couple of questions, but seriously didn't care at the same time... heh.  For instance, during the main story, the movie kept flipping to a video diary of a scientist in an underground bunker. I have no clue what this guy was talking about. I THINK he was the inventor of this virus but other than that... I'm not sure what was going on. There was military down there holding the scientists `prisoners' I'm guessing. The military didn't look like US military though because they had beards and long hair and wearing hats in doors... unless the director just didn't know anything about the military except they wear camouflage. Then the scientists and military turn into 'zombies' which you could see coming a mile away.And one major thing I dont like about the movie is the constant music/score that plays. I hate when movies have music or scores playing through 99% of the movie. Sometimes a scene would be a LOT better and MUCH more suspenseful if it was quiet.There was 3 parts that I did like about the movie though.1.  The idea of bunkers and tunnels that spread through out our whole country like one big underground city.2.  One scene where a guy is running towards the main warehouse door and gets pulled back by `zombies' when he was only a foot away from salvation.3.  The crazy white girl scene where she comes out the door first. She looks like she is about 12 or 13 years old. White hair, white dress, pale white skin, blood dripping down her mouth and chin. She's crouching with her hands on her knees like a baseball player waiting for the batter to hit. She's moving her head from left to right, smiling at the zombies with a crazy look in her eyes.  Then she pounces for them. I thought that was done really well, even though I don't know what the hell was wrong with her.In the end, I would just say skip this movie. I do give the actors and director a thumb up for trying though. It could've been a lot worse.",2,The low budget wasnt the only thing that makes this film bad,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,3943,"['First', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'low', 'budget', 'not.', 'Day', 'X', 'was', 'nothing', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'outbreak', 'occurs', 'people', 'turn', 'zombies', 'Later', 'find', 'out', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'zombies', 'what', 'are', 'called', 'movie', 'would', 'call', 'ashen', 'burn', 'victims', 'what', 'looked', 'Imagine', 'cartoon', 'character', 'hold', 'bomb', 'then', 'bomb', 'off', 'are', 'still', 'holding', 'now', 'imagine', 'what', 'cartoon', 'character', 'now', 'Yep', 'black', 'ashy', 'When', 'outbreak', 'have', 'Frank', 'Chambers', 'main', 'character', 'walking', 'car', 'parking', 'garage', 'then', 'attacked', '50', 'zombies', 'away', 'making', 'car', 'maybe', 'not', 'car', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'fumbling', 'keys', 'hotwiring', 'zombies', 'were', 'open', 'window', 'just', 'touching', 'not', 'actually', 'pulling', 'window', 'even', 'do', 'later', 'next', 'thing', 'see', 'running', 'around', 'carrying', 'white', 'girl', 'shoulder', 'where', 'heck', 'did', 'come', 'abandoned', 'warehouse', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'people', 'getting', 'know', 'one', 'Frank', 'Chambers', 'hand', 'out', 'guns', 'jobs', 'do', 'Rescue', 'way', 'girl', 'brought', 'very', 'important', 'cure', 'what', 'going', 'outside', 'When', 'rescue', 'bad', 'up', 'remaining', 'survivors', 'make', 'secret', 'government', 'bunkers', 'tunnels', 'spread', 'country.Now', 'movie', 'ok', 'quality', 'film', 'sound', 'actors', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'cut', 'Everything', 'looks', 'fake', 'sounds', 'fake', 'actors', 'are', 'horrible', 'actually', 'look', 'are', 'thinking', 'lines', 'actions', 'Sometimes', 'when', ""'huff"", 'are', 'mad', 'are', 'thinking', 'part', 'script', ""'huff"", 'puff', 'cause', 'mad', 'story', ""n't"", 'extremely', 'bad', 'did', 'feel', 'incomplete', 'was', 'left', 'couple', 'questions', 'seriously', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'same', 'time', 'heh', 'instance', 'main', 'story', 'movie', 'kept', 'flipping', 'video', 'diary', 'scientist', 'underground', 'bunker', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'guy', 'was', 'talking', 'THINK', 'was', 'inventor', 'virus', 'other', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'military', 'down', 'there', 'holding', 'scientists', 'prisoners', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'military', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'US', 'military', 'though', 'had', 'beards', 'long', 'hair', 'wearing', 'hats', 'doors', 'director', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'military', 'wear', 'camouflage', 'Then', 'scientists', 'military', 'turn', ""'zombies"", 'could', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away.And', 'one', 'major', 'thing', 'dont', 'movie', 'constant', 'music/score', 'hate', 'when', 'movies', 'have', 'music', 'scores', 'playing', '99', '%', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'scene', 'would', 'be', 'LOT', 'better', 'MUCH', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'was', 'quiet.There', 'was', '3', 'parts', 'did', 'like', 'movie', 'though.1', 'idea', 'bunkers', 'tunnels', 'spread', 'whole', 'country', 'one', 'big', 'underground', 'city.2', 'One', 'scene', 'where', 'guy', 'running', 'main', 'warehouse', 'door', 'pulled', 'back', 'zombies', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'foot', 'away', 'salvation.3', 'crazy', 'white', 'girl', 'scene', 'where', 'out', 'door', 'first', 'about', '12', '13', 'years', 'old', 'White', 'hair', 'white', 'dress', 'pale', 'white', 'skin', 'blood', 'dripping', 'down', 'mouth', 'chin', 'crouching', 'hands', 'knees', 'baseball', 'player', 'waiting', 'batter', 'hit', 'moving', 'head', 'left', 'right', 'smiling', 'zombies', 'crazy', 'look', 'eyes', 'Then', 'thought', 'was', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'hell', 'was', 'wrong', 'end', 'would', 'just', 'say', 'skip', 'movie', 'do', 'give', 'actors', 'director', 'thumb', 'up', 'trying', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lot', 'worse']",N/A

1097576,A2W82ICVTTYAOY,B000UYN9NG,Zombob,"[32, 34]","Night of the Living Dead meets 28 Days / Weeks Later!1) ACTING: The acting was pretty good. There were a few people who I personally dreaded when they had a scene, which was bad, because it took me out of the movie and away from the viewing experience. But, the majority fot he actors were decent and should pursue Hollywood.2) PRODUCTION: While original ideas for zombie movies are few and far between, A decent director can take something that we've seen before, and if not make it seem new, can at least spice it up to where we, the viewers, want to watch. This movie falls somewhere between those two. Familiarity is comfortable, but often boring. And the director really tries to keep us going. The movie is very fast paced, and the viewer really isn't given time to become bored or distracted. Familiar ideas are presented to the viewer, but with a little twist. The camerawork on this film wasn't too bad, and the cameraman did attempt to give the viewer some nifty scenes. The blood and gore was pretty good, and the soundtrack added to the film's suspense and uneasiness. And the homage to the original Night of the Living Dead was a nice touch, too.3) THE ZOMBIES: Overall, not a whole lot of different ideas appear with our zombie friends, but there are a few twists that I won't mention that will pleasantly surprise you.4) THE CAUSE: A lethal toxin is released in the air supply.5) NUDITY: None.To sum it all up, this is a pretty good indie flick. When a good indie zombie flick is released, it's such a nice surprise. So many times, less than stellar zombie indie fare is released, and we, as lovers of the genre, accept it, as we have become so used to it. When movies like Day X are released, it raises the bar for other low budget indies, and there could be trouble for the next set of zombie filmmakers. While Day X does have budget issues, it covers for them pretty good. It may be the same old roller coaster ride, but with a few new twists and turns. I would not be surprised to see a sequel ('Day Y?') and hopefully, it will be as good as the original.RATING: 3.5 out of 5",3,A review from Zombiefans!,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,2094,"['Night', 'Living', 'Dead', '28', 'Days', '/', 'Weeks', 'Later', '1', 'ACTING', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'were', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'personally', 'dreaded', 'when', 'had', 'scene', 'was', 'bad', 'took', 'movie', 'away', 'viewing', 'experience', 'majority', 'fot', 'were', 'decent', 'should', 'pursue', 'Hollywood.2', 'PRODUCTION', 'original', 'ideas', 'zombie', 'movies', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'A', 'decent', 'director', 'can', 'take', 'something', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'make', 'seem', 'new', 'can', 'least', 'spice', 'where', 'viewers', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'somewhere', 'two', 'Familiarity', 'comfortable', 'often', 'boring', 'director', 'really', 'keep', 'going', 'movie', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'viewer', 'really', ""n't"", 'given', 'time', 'become', 'bored', 'distracted', 'Familiar', 'ideas', 'are', 'presented', 'viewer', 'little', 'twist', 'camerawork', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'cameraman', 'did', 'attempt', 'give', 'viewer', 'nifty', 'scenes', 'blood', 'gore', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'added', 'film', 'suspense', 'uneasiness', 'homage', 'original', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'too.3', 'THE', 'ZOMBIES', 'Overall', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'different', 'ideas', 'appear', 'zombie', 'friends', 'are', 'few', 'twists', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'will', 'pleasantly', 'surprise', 'you.4', 'THE', 'CAUSE', 'lethal', 'toxin', 'released', 'air', 'supply.5', 'NUDITY', 'None.To', 'sum', 'up', 'pretty', 'good', 'indie', 'flick', 'When', 'good', 'indie', 'zombie', 'flick', 'released', 'such', 'nice', 'surprise', 'So', 'many', 'times', 'less', 'stellar', 'zombie', 'indie', 'fare', 'released', 'lovers', 'genre', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'used', 'When', 'movies', 'Day', 'X', 'are', 'released', 'bar', 'other', 'low', 'budget', 'indies', 'could', 'be', 'trouble', 'next', 'set', 'zombie', 'filmmakers', 'Day', 'X', 'have', 'budget', 'issues', 'pretty', 'good', 'may', 'be', 'same', 'old', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'few', 'new', 'twists', 'turns', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'sequel', ""'Day"", 'Y', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'original.RATING', '3.5', '5']",N/A
