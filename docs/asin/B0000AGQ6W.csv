762872,A1Y07DRNJ1DKNK,B0000AGQ6W,Anon,"[2, 3]","Recommended esp. for teenagers andparents of Fil-Ams. Mix of WB & Filipino melodrama in style.Derek Mercado was wonderful as the Filipino ""Malcolm X"" - typecharacter of THE DEBUT film. He's very talented and I hope we get tosee him in future roles that allows him to shine as an actor. Hisradical speeches balanced out the fluffy romance scenes. I loved thewell written, passionated rants of the character telling of the past oppressions put upon the Filipino people, that many Fil-Ams and other Americans seemed to have forgotten.THE DEBUT film showed Fil-Ams & Fils. as flawed, three-dimensional and redeeming characters instead of your typical stereotypical Filipinos. Many Fil/FilAm audience members seemed to be uncomfortable about this. Iunderstand why: nobody likes to see people of their culture beingportrayed as less than glamorous, like many of my relatives. However,as characters in a drama, i found them compelling. The two mostinteresting characters being the FOB (someone help me with his name &the actor's) and Edwin Mercado (played by Derek Basco).Other highlights of THE DEBUT are the amazing performances by Filipino traditional dancers and musicians. These are first class performers in the community with high quality costume design. What rare and unexpected treat!It's wonderful to Fil & Fil-Ams represented on film and inspiring tosee the just as engaging behind-the-scenes special feature on the DVD.It shows how some Filipinos really do not support the artsbecause of the stigma artists have in the Phils. (just like in thePhilippines). It was disappointing that none of the hundred or so finephysicians of the Fil. community did not respond to his lettersrequesting financial support for the film. On the other hand the DVDspecial feature highlights the wonderful support from angels from theFilipino community such as blue collar workers to the Sony picturesexec. F. Friedman, as well as the audiences who attended screenings allover America during the film's tour.I encourage Fil-Am doctors & nurses (like my relatives) to share thelove and support the film arts! I will buy this for my mother forChristmas, and show my children when they are teens. Also, theaccomplished Fil & Fil-Am artists should get the recognition theydeserve just as the fine doctors of the same community do, ESPECIALLYsince the Phil Am film wave is a young one. These filmmakers need to benurtured and supported to thrive, grow and improve the quality of theirpictures.Hope to see more from Cajayon & Castro. Support Fil-Am & Fil filmartists! Good luck to the filmmakers. We hope to see more from you inthe future.- R.

Viloria ""dodomaster""","[2, 3]","Considering the dearth of any movies made by Filipinos for international release, this movie is a nice little way of saying, &quot;Hello, we are Filipinos and we very capable of producing quality stuff&quot;.  Having seen &quot;American Adobo&quot; and thoroughly disappointed, &quot;The Debut&quot; is made of better material.  While Dante Basco really shines in the movie, my personal pick is Tirso Cruz who actually acted very very well.  He was not over the top, he was well composed, he was perfect for the role.  Even his syrupy singing is well forgiven...the movie delves heavily into the cliche-approach (party foods, dancing, dog-eating comments, fob comments, angst-covered youth, wannabe break dancers and such, etc.).  I can usually relate to most of the scenes but this was exactly why i didn't give it the whole 5 stars.  The next Filipino movie should be devoid of the familiar cultural attack and should start exploring other niches of cinematic brilliance without being too involved with melancholy musings.As a nice compliment to the movie, I've never seen so many cute and pretty Pinays, so there, I've said the best part of the movie.  Hope Gene Cagayon's next flick can transcend the cultural, political, and PINOY-related consciousness and just make a movie we all can be proud.  He's on his way...the film was just right, the deleted scenes were rightfully taken out, and the  main characters acted with passion and professionalism.

762877,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B0000AGQ6W,Chris Luallen,"[7, 9]","""The Debut"" revolves around the character of Ben Mercado, an intelligent and energetic young man who is determined to follow his dream of going to art school. Meanwhile, Ben's father wants him to pursue a medical career. During his sister's ""debut"" celebration Ben learns a greater appreciation for traditional Filipino culture as well coming to a better understanding with his father.I'm an Anglo who also has an interest in learning about other cultures. So I was pleased to find this film made by and about Filipino-Americans, a group much too under represented in American cinema.I enjoyed watching the dynamic interaction between the influences of modernism and tradition. I also found myself cheering for Ben to beat up the bully, get the girl, make up with his dad, etc.Unfortunately, this movie was just not very well made in certain aspects. The screenwriting, especially the stilted dialogue, was a weakness. Also the characters were often portrayed as stereotypes rather than fully nuanced individuals. I believe this was director/writer Gene Cajayon's first feature film. He seemed to be trying too hard to make a movie with broad commercial appeal rather than just make the best possible movie.This one is worth watching.

762878,A342YAXL116N5A,B0000AGQ6W,Dennis!,"[4, 6]","Okay, by now you pretty much know the primary plot:  Ben, Filipino-American adolescent, is having problems with his all-too-strict father, who wants his son to become a doctor despite Ben's clear artistic genius.  This serves as a starting point for the movie, and it's meant to be driven forward by a debutante ball thrown by the family for Ben's little sister.In the meantime, however, the movie decides to take, oh, about a gazillion detours into random stereotypes.  And yes, they're ALL thrown in there:  The gangster gun-toting ""bad-ass.""  The guy who's willing to spend all kinds of mad cash on souping up his car.  The Filipino-American Black Panther spouting off on The Man's attempts to keep his brown brothers down.  The kid who's been in the States for two years and still pronounces his ""f""s like ""p""s.  Oh yes, they're AAAALL in there.Eventually during the course of the film we learn that Ben's dad was quite a talented singer in his youth, but he eventually gave up that ""hobby"" in favor of providing for his wife and kids.  Turns out Dad's insistence that Ben abandon his artistic talent mirrors his own type of sacrifice.  And when we see Dad's father (Ben's grandfather) drills Dad a new one for all kinds of things that were beyond Dad's control, you would think Dad would realize what kind of vicious cycle he's perpetuating upon his son.  Let's face it, Filipino men are NOT portrayed as great people in this movie.Another little detour the movie takes along the way is Ben's ""identity crisis.""  This subplot is difficult to follow, mostly because Ben doesn't really manifest an innate hatred of the color of his skin.  We're led to believe he has a problem because people accuse him of having a problem, but we don't really get to see it for ourselves.  Meanwhile, Ben is accused of selling out his Filipino heritage because he seems to have only white friends and he has little interest in his sister's party.  This makes him a ""coconut""?  The rather frightening implication of this accusation is that Filipino-Americans in this country should only be mixing with their own kind, and if you have non Filipino friends, you're selling out.  And what teenager, of any race, isn't at some point embarrassed by his family?And one quick note about Ben's two non-Filipino friends:  While I found them to be cool people, I found them strangely, and somewhat unbelievably, open-minded.  How many non-minority teenagers do you know who would delay plans to go to a cool friend's party in order to sit around and watch an ""ethnic"" dance, or to hear a song sung in a language they don't even understand?The movie obviously resolves itself by the end in the way all movies of this genre will.  Despite my review, the movie is still a fun show.

I give it five stars just for the monumental effort that was put forth by everyone involved in this movie.  They can teach you a thing or two about persistence, hard work and fullfilling a dream.  The DVD has loads of extras about making this movie and the herculean determination of  Gene and Company to get this movie seen.  Ofcourse most of the moviegoers were Filipino-Americans, and rightly so, this is about them, but I think anyone can admire and appreciate this movie.  The script was crisp and right on and the acting was surprisingly good.  Dante Basco who plays the lead role has actually appeared in a few popular movies like &quot;Hook&quot; and &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie,&quot; he was the plain wrap, ethnic car jacker. To see him in an independent low budget movie is admirable and he worked just as hard to get this movie made.  To say that this movie represents the typical Filipino-American experience is overreaching, but it did touch on a few familiar themes that immigrants to this country share like, balancing conformity with staying true to your roots.  There are also a few inside jokes that main audiences might not get, so bring your filipino friend along to explain, then you'll be laughing too.  Overall, I think this movie is cute, and well made.

She agreed that it is an accurate picture of life in a Philippino family and community.  Our only criticism would be the ghetto language which has kept us from showing it to my half Philippino grandchildren.  The harsh language was not necessary.  But it is an excellent movie despite the few moments of crude talk.  We did show my granddaughter the dance scenes.  In fact we watched the traditional dance scenes about five times!What is most pointed in the movie is that despite our ethnic backgrounds many things are the same within our family structures, our communication with each other and that even within the same culture there are wide differences such as between Ben (the good boy) and Augusto (the bad boy).  I hope to see more movies like this. The Basco brothers were great in this movie and Dante Basco has come a long way from his Ruffio days in the movie Peter Pan.",4,We're not all that different....,1077580800,"02 24, 2004",2004,945,"['recently', 'watched', 'Debut', 'Filipina', 'daughter-in-law', 'agreed', 'accurate', 'picture', 'life', 'Philippino', 'family', 'community', 'only', 'criticism', 'would', 'be', 'ghetto', 'language', 'kept', 'showing', 'half', 'Philippino', 'grandchildren', 'harsh', 'language', 'was', 'not', 'necessary', 'excellent', 'movie', 'few', 'moments', 'crude', 'talk', 'did', 'show', 'granddaughter', 'dance', 'scenes', 'fact', 'watched', 'traditional', 'dance', 'scenes', 'five', 'times', 'What', 'most', 'pointed', 'movie', 'ethnic', 'backgrounds', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'same', 'family', 'communication', 'other', 'even', 'same', 'culture', 'are', 'wide', 'differences', 'such', 'Ben', 'good', 'boy', 'Augusto', 'bad', 'boy', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'movies', 'Basco', 'brothers', 'were', 'great', 'movie', 'Dante', 'Basco', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'Ruffio', 'days', 'movie', 'Peter', 'Pan']",N/A

This film not only tells about a Filipino family's living and lifestyle in the land of the free but also of How one can be proud of the culture he or she was born with. I would like also to emphasize that this film is an eye-opener for those Filipino-American teenagers who's looking themselves as one of the white men...hey come'on, wake up from your senses! You're brown-skin men! Never let your ego be polluted with such concept of who's inferior and who's superior! The movie did good for presenting this kind of situation among Fil-Am teenagers.On a personal note, Cajayon done a good directing by unravelling the real drama of a Filipino family though somehow focusing on a notable character of Dante Basco as Ben, who somehow not getting a sense of pride for his culture and background not unitl He realizes his true identity in a party of white teenagers. This is the turning point of the story..well, nothing's new about it but a simple realization of how Ben cope up with his identity.Like what I said, this film is a breakthrough but it could really be more interesting to see and watch, a filipino movie with more heart.",3,Please Wake Up!

762884,AOUEOXRQJDK3S,B0000AGQ6W,Xavier H.,"[0, 0]","Whether you like this movie or not, you have to admit that The Debut is a landmark film for the Filipino-American community. The journey that this film has been on just to get to this point is nothing less than remarkable. For that reason alone, a lot of people are very excited to jump on the bandwagon of this movie without knowing a single thing about it. They claim to like this movie, but the only reason they claim to like it is because they see their favorite Filipino food on the screen or their favorite Filipino cultural tidbit and they think that's cool. But this movie is more than just a bunch of cheap pops that make Filipinos feel cool just because they're on the big screen. The Debut does well on its own merits.The story of this movie is very well played out. Throughout the movie, you can definitely feel the tension between Ben and his father and the clash in their respective cultures and attitudes. You don't need to be Filipino in order to see that. Also, when Lolo Carlos and Augusto are added in, you see Ben trying to be pulled in two different directions, neither of which he wants to go towards. His identity crisis as a Filipino-American at a crossroads in his life is definitely apparent through the supporting cast. Also, the Dad isn't just the strict father that does what he wants and expects whatever he says to be the truth. Through his scenes with Ben and Lolo Carlos, you can definitely see the root of his means. By the end of the movie, you don't get a cornball ending where everyone hugs and laughs off into the sunset. You get a realistic ending that reflects the society we live in as people, not just Filipinos.Sure, the tidbits of Filipino culture that are thrown in such as the traditional dancing, food, and mannerisms definitely appeal to the Filipino-American community. But The Debut is a movie that can transcend ethnic background. It's more than a cheap appeal to a minority that is struggling to belong. If there's one criticism I have about this movie, it's that the acting at some points is often awkward. But it doesn't take away from the overall impact of the movie.All in all, I overwhelmingly recommend that you get The Debut no matter what your nationality is. It's a great movie and a great DVD. The special features of the DVD really let you know how much struggle, hardship, and effort went into making this movie a reality for the entire community, not just Filipino-Americans.",4,more than meets the eye,1063584000,"09 15, 2003",2003,2440,"['movie', 'not', 'have', 'admit', 'Debut', 'landmark', 'film', 'Filipino-American', 'community', 'journey', 'film', 'been', 'just', 'get', 'point', 'nothing', 'less', 'remarkable', 'reason', 'alone', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'very', 'excited', 'jump', 'bandwagon', 'movie', 'knowing', 'single', 'thing', 'claim', 'like', 'movie', 'only', 'reason', 'claim', 'like', 'see', 'favorite', 'Filipino', 'food', 'screen', 'favorite', 'Filipino', 'cultural', 'tidbit', 'think', 'cool', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'bunch', 'cheap', 'pops', 'make', 'Filipinos', 'feel', 'cool', 'just', ""'re"", 'big', 'screen', 'Debut', 'well', 'own', 'merits.The', 'story', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'movie', 'can', 'definitely', 'feel', 'tension', 'Ben', 'father', 'clash', 'respective', 'cultures', 'attitudes', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'Filipino', 'order', 'see', 'Also', 'when', 'Lolo', 'Carlos', 'Augusto', 'are', 'added', 'see', 'Ben', 'trying', 'be', 'pulled', 'two', 'different', 'directions', 'go', 'towards', 'identity', 'crisis', 'Filipino-American', 'crossroads', 'life', 'definitely', 'apparent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Also', 'Dad', ""n't"", 'just', 'strict', 'father', 'what', 'be', 'truth', 'scenes', 'Ben', 'Lolo', 'Carlos', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'root', 'means', 'end', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'cornball', 'ending', 'where', 'everyone', 'hugs', 'off', 'sunset', 'get', 'realistic', 'ending', 'society', 'live', 'people', 'not', 'just', 'Filipinos.Sure', 'tidbits', 'Filipino', 'culture', 'are', 'thrown', 'such', 'traditional', 'dancing', 'food', 'mannerisms', 'definitely', 'appeal', 'Filipino-American', 'community', 'Debut', 'movie', 'can', 'transcend', 'ethnic', 'background', 'more', 'cheap', 'appeal', 'minority', 'struggling', 'belong', 'one', 'criticism', 'have', 'movie', 'acting', 'points', 'often', 'awkward', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'impact', 'movie.All', 'overwhelmingly', 'recommend', 'get', 'Debut', 'matter', 'what', 'nationality', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'really', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'struggle', 'hardship', 'effort', 'went', 'making', 'movie', 'reality', 'entire', 'community', 'not', 'just', 'Filipino-Americans']",N/A
