In a typical episode, the trio of Ryan, Micki and Jack try and retrieve a cursed item sold from the antique store they inherited. The cursed items are indestructible, so they are placed in a vault below the store for safe keeping.There are a lot of great episodes but if I had to pick my favorite one, I'd say ""Wedding in Black."" Technically there wasn't a cursed item in that episode which would help explain why the Snow Globe broke. Cursed items normally required a human sacrifice in a specific way to receive a benefit which had a theme related to the item.Most people who used the cursed items met unfortunate ends. A lot of the time revenge or greed fueled the use of the cursed items. Some of the episodes brought up the ethical question of whether it was ever right to use a cursed item. Would it be right, for example, to use a cursed item for revenge against those who tried to rape you and were responsible for you being completely paralyzed? There were even a couple of times where the trio tricked the bad guy into using the cursed item to help them out or used the cursed item themselves.Friday the 13th, the series was a fantastic series.

1266379,A367NRRUGVD824,B002FLOTPO,Jeffrey Michael Kent,"[85, 92]","I was torn between giving this DVD collection 4 or 5 Stars. This TV show probably won't meet the standards and expectations of many, but I figure anyone who is seriously considering this item for purchase is likely already familiar with Friday The 13th The Series. The show is over 20 years old... it is what it is... in terms of quality and value, I feel it's worthy of a good solid and fair 5 Star Rating. I'll just make a few additional comments.Currently Amazon's price tag on this item is $90.99 (a savings of $11.48 over buying the 3 seasons individually). It's really not a bad price for 72 episodes (17 disks). One thing you should know is this is NOT a fancy boxed set. There is no collector/storage box or extra DVD full of special features. All this is are the show's 3 individual complete season boxed DVDs, all taped together and sold as a ""pack"".As for the show itself, it's practically timeless! Yes, the special effects are cheesy, the story lines are a bit corny... but the show was from 1987-1990. I was in Junior High during that time, and used to watch it with my grandmother, so for me there is a certain sentimental value in watching these episodes again. Oddly enough the show doesn't really seem ""dated"", EXCEPT for a few minor, but distracting things: All the casual smoking. The lack of cell phones. And the music was TERRIBLE (mostly because they didn't pay for the rights to any commercially popular music... you get what you pay for, and in this case, it's crap).It's been fun watching the episodes in the order they were broadcast because there is a very subtle sense of continuity with the back story of the characters from episode to episode. This is something I never really picked up on before as the show was syndicated, and many of the episodes I caught in re-runs. Also, I never fully understood the transition from Ryan to Johnny at the end of season 2 and start of season 3. Now I get it! It's easy to see how Friday The 13th The Series didn't survive season 3. As effect technology slowly improved, the stories didn't. It lost its charm... BUT, it was good while it lasted, and I have no regrets at all in spending nearly a hundred bucks on this set.",5,"Hey, It Is What It Is!",1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,2190,"['was', 'torn', 'giving', 'DVD', 'collection', '4', '5', 'Stars', 'TV', 'show', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'meet', 'standards', 'expectations', 'many', 'figure', 'anyone', 'who', 'seriously', 'considering', 'item', 'purchase', 'likely', 'already', 'familiar', 'Friday', '13th', 'Series', 'show', '20', 'years', 'old', 'what', 'terms', 'quality', 'value', 'feel', 'worthy', 'good', 'solid', 'fair', '5', 'Star', 'Rating', ""'ll"", 'just', 'make', 'few', 'additional', 'comments.Currently', 'Amazon', 'price', 'tag', 'item', '90.99', 'savings', '11.48', 'buying', '3', 'seasons', 'individually', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'price', '72', 'episodes', '17', 'disks', 'One', 'thing', 'should', 'know', 'NOT', 'fancy', 'boxed', 'set', 'collector/storage', 'box', 'extra', 'DVD', 'full', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'show', '3', 'individual', 'complete', 'season', 'boxed', 'DVDs', 'taped', 'together', 'sold', 'pack', '.As', 'show', 'practically', 'timeless', 'Yes', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'cheesy', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'bit', 'corny', 'show', 'was', '1987-1990', 'was', 'Junior', 'High', 'time', 'used', 'watch', 'grandmother', 'so', 'certain', 'sentimental', 'value', 'watching', 'episodes', 'again', 'Oddly', 'show', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'dated', 'EXCEPT', 'few', 'minor', 'distracting', 'things', 'casual', 'smoking', 'lack', 'cell', 'phones', 'music', 'was', 'TERRIBLE', 'mostly', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'rights', 'commercially', 'popular', 'music', 'get', 'what', 'pay', 'case', 'crap', '.It', 'been', 'fun', 'watching', 'episodes', 'order', 'were', 'broadcast', 'very', 'subtle', 'sense', 'continuity', 'back', 'story', 'characters', 'episode', 'episode', 'something', 'never', 'really', 'picked', 'up', 'show', 'was', 'syndicated', 'many', 'episodes', 'caught', 're-runs', 'Also', 'never', 'fully', 'understood', 'transition', 'Ryan', 'Johnny', 'end', 'season', '2', 'start', 'season', '3', 'Now', 'get', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'Friday', '13th', 'Series', 'did', ""n't"", 'survive', 'season', '3', 'effect', 'technology', 'slowly', 'improved', 'stories', 'did', ""n't"", 'lost', 'charm', 'BUT', 'was', 'good', 'lasted', 'have', 'regrets', 'spending', 'nearly', 'hundred', 'bucks', 'set']",Friday the 13th: The Series - Season 1-3

It is about an antique shop who's devil dealing dealer sold evil cursed objects that have to be recovered by his niece & nephew; along with an old friend who also studied the occult.Just finishing the First Season of this 80's classic.  The special effects are very cheesy & low budget.  At the same time though it is great due to equally cheesy acting by Robey (the red head).  I really enjoyed this show when it was originally on.  The title honestly is what grabbed the attention, but once you began watching it you could not stop.  You were & still are hooked.The Sci-Fi Channel has been playing re-runs of this for some time now.  This was the only way to really watch it.  Luckily we now have it on DVD.  The quality of picture is not the greatest, but it does not become a distraction when viewing.  The sound is about the same.  The music score is exactly the same thankfully.  The First Season of HUNTER was recently purchased & they changed the majority of the back ground tunes.  All of the 80's classics are gone.  The regular score though is still intact. It is surprisingly graphic at times for a television show from the 80's.  It is common place now, but for back then this was pretty hard core.  Honestly though, the first few episodes were a little dry, but it picked up immediately after.  The evil doll episode is still great.If you were a fan originally when this show first came out then it would be a good idea to purchase this set.  It still holds up even as an adult watching it.  Get it on sale while you can.

With out any shadow of a doubt the great and sexy Louise Robey was the star of this series, with Mr. Chris Wiggins offering a great support character role of the older but still heroic and intellectually scholarly &#34;Jack Marshack&#34;, ready to defend the forces of man's good side against the other worldly demonic forces of evil.Everything about this show reminds me of how much I loved the 80's, and it brings back so many memories of my childhood years.  This show has nothing to do with that horror slasher series (with Michael Myers or Jason?? Who ever he was.)  This is a more slightly lighter but still scary and ghostly bizarre adventure show about two young heroes and Chris Wiggins trying to save the world from Satanic objects that must be obtained and stored in a special vault.  One of the Sci Fi channel's shows copied this exact plot some years later, but this 80's original with the beautiful and sexy Robey.",5,One of my favorite shows of the 80's & early 90's,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",2014,1021,"['have', 'watched', 'most', 'episodes', 'recently', 'not', 'seeing', 'many', 'years', 'out', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'great', 'sexy', 'Louise', 'Robey', 'was', 'star', 'series', 'Mr.', 'Chris', 'Wiggins', 'offering', 'great', 'support', 'character', 'role', 'older', 'still', 'heroic', 'intellectually', 'scholarly', '34', 'Jack', 'Marshack', '34', 'ready', 'defend', 'forces', 'man', 'good', 'side', 'other', 'worldly', 'demonic', 'forces', 'evil.Everything', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'loved', '80', 'back', 'so', 'many', 'memories', 'childhood', 'years', 'show', 'nothing', 'do', 'horror', 'slasher', 'series', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Jason', 'Who', 'ever', 'was', 'more', 'slightly', 'lighter', 'still', 'scary', 'ghostly', 'bizarre', 'adventure', 'show', 'two', 'young', 'heroes', 'Chris', 'Wiggins', 'trying', 'save', 'world', 'Satanic', 'objects', 'must', 'be', 'obtained', 'stored', 'special', 'vault', 'One', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'channel', 'shows', 'copied', 'exact', 'plot', 'years', 'later', '80', 'original', 'beautiful', 'sexy', 'Robey']",Friday the 13th: The Series - Season 1-3
