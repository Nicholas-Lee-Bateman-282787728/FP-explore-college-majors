666576,A3TJJHMWV3SFNI,B00005N5QZ,"Brett Heitkam ""DVD obsessed""","[38, 38]","Poison is not a great movie, but it so entertaining that it doesn't matter.  Kari Wuhrer plays a young gal whose husband commits suicide after being fired from his job.  After learning from her husband's former boss that the company had hired someone to replace him long before he was even fired because he wasn't a good worker, Kari's character snaps (she blames the company for her hubby's death).  She then decides to exact revenge; first on the boss guy, and then on the woman who replaced her husband (played by soap star Barbara Crampton).Poison is dark, sexy, and a lot of fun as well.  There are a couple of instances where the acting could be a bit better (such as the Garrett's original housekeeper and their daughter) but Kari Wuhrer and Barbara Crampton make up for that.  The pacing is quick, the death scenes well done, and there's enough nudity to please any fan of skin (you eventually see every female character in various stages of undress...although it looked like Ms. Crampton may have used a body double).The DVD features Audio Commentary from the director, cast bios, original trailer, and photo gallery.  The picture in in 1.85:1 widescreen and it is pristine and crystal clear.  The audio is offered in 5.1 and 2.0 surround sound.  The 5.1 mix is good.  Loud where it should be, and the surround channels are used occasionally for emphasis.Overall, a good choice for purchase or rental.",5,"If you like B-movies, this one is sure to entertain",1058400000,"07 17, 2003",2003,1410,"['Poison', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'so', 'entertaining', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'young', 'gal', 'husband', 'commits', 'suicide', 'being', 'fired', 'job', 'learning', 'husband', 'former', 'boss', 'company', 'had', 'hired', 'someone', 'replace', 'long', 'was', 'even', 'fired', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'worker', 'Kari', 'character', 'snaps', 'company', 'hubby', 'death', 'then', 'exact', 'revenge', 'first', 'boss', 'guy', 'then', 'woman', 'who', 'replaced', 'husband', 'played', 'soap', 'star', 'Barbara', 'Crampton', '.Poison', 'dark', 'sexy', 'lot', 'fun', 'well', 'are', 'couple', 'instances', 'where', 'acting', 'could', 'be', 'bit', 'better', 'such', 'Garrett', 'original', 'housekeeper', 'daughter', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'Barbara', 'Crampton', 'make', 'up', 'pacing', 'quick', 'death', 'scenes', 'well', 'done', 'enough', 'nudity', 'please', 'fan', 'skin', 'eventually', 'see', 'female', 'character', 'various', 'stages', 'undress', 'looked', 'Ms.', 'Crampton', 'may', 'have', 'used', 'body', 'double', '.The', 'DVD', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'director', 'cast', 'bios', 'original', 'trailer', 'photo', 'gallery', 'picture', '1.85:1', 'widescreen', 'pristine', 'crystal', 'clear', 'audio', 'offered', '5.1', '2.0', 'surround', 'sound', '5.1', 'mix', 'good', 'Loud', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'surround', 'channels', 'are', 'used', 'occasionally', 'emphasis.Overall', 'good', 'choice', 'purchase', 'rental']",Poison

Exhibit A: Kari Wuhrer Poison, a pretty-blatant rip off of the Shannon Tweed movie Scrorned.Ann (WUHRER~!) is seeking revenge for her husband against the Garrett's, a nice, suburban family if ever there was one.  She moves in as their nanny and begins to seduce 3/4 of the family.  There's the problem right there.  I can think of atleast three better ways of getting revenge than letting them have sex with Kari Wuhrer.  In fact, that's really more of a reward.Taking into account that it's a rip-off, it's actually better than the movie it copies.  I'll take Kari over Shannon seven days a week and twice on Sunday.  The few suspenseful parts are actually suspenseful (the freezer in the garage pops to mind), and the pool scene is the hottest since Phoebe Cates in Ridgemont High.Kari can do better, but she got her name in the title and that's something usually reserved for John Carpenter.  This is not a bad way to spend 90 m. if you can get past the predictability.",2,Scorned - Tweed + Wuhrer = Better Movie,1018483200,"04 11, 2002",2002,1105,"['Someone', 'once', 'said', 'are', 'only', 'five', 'six', 'real', 'stories', 'writers', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'recycling', 'past', '10,000', 'years', 'Exhibit', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'Poison', 'pretty-blatant', 'rip', 'Shannon', 'Tweed', 'movie', 'Scrorned.Ann', 'WUHRER~', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'husband', 'Garrett', 'nice', 'suburban', 'family', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'nanny', 'seduce', '3/4', 'family', 'problem', 'right', 'there', 'can', 'think', 'atleast', 'three', 'better', 'ways', 'getting', 'revenge', 'letting', 'have', 'sex', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'fact', 'really', 'more', 'reward.Taking', 'account', 'rip-off', 'actually', 'better', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'take', 'Kari', 'Shannon', 'seven', 'days', 'week', 'twice', 'Sunday', 'few', 'suspenseful', 'parts', 'are', 'actually', 'suspenseful', 'freezer', 'garage', 'mind', 'pool', 'scene', 'hottest', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'Ridgemont', 'High.Kari', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'got', 'name', 'title', 'something', 'usually', 'reserved', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'spend', '90', 'm.', 'can', 'get', 'predictability']",Poison

Thompson,"[9, 12]","I'm not really sure if everyone else who wrote a review here was watching the same movie I was.Poison was a terrific blend of suspense, sex, seduction, and revenge. Some more time could have been spent developing the beginning and a few other places, but it is really no big deal in this case.This movie is the story of a wife out for revenge on the people she deems responsible for her husband's demise.

Kari Wuhrer played the role of a scorned wife who's husband committs suicide after being fired from his job.
