328816,A6HZN83OUPYRN,6302717450,976-ERIC,"[2, 3]","After witnessing the onset death of his actress mother in a most implausible way (what movie crew would use a metal fence with their actors near electricity?), child of divorce, Jeff (Furlong), is off to live with his dad permanently and must accept the fact that his parents will never get back together. Or will they? Director Lambert makes the returned dead a bit more interesting this time by making them more intelligent and cunning. Unfortunately this was primarily used as a means to portray a lot of cheesy and cheap ""shocks"" and even unexplained motives for the Gus (Clancy Brown) character. Gone is the endearment and tragedy of the original; substituted with excessive gore f/x and spiteful characters. Furlong, who managed to impress in his early roles with characters who had similar family of origin problems (Terminator 2, American Heart, Brain Scan, A Home of Our Own), doesn't do much here outside of sullen glares, cuss and cry ""Mom!"" (literally) a number of times. Overall cheesy fun for horror fans but a flop in the character and scare departments. Hard to believe Mary Lambert, director of the first film, is responsible for this major dispointment of a sequel to the superior original. The ending suggests a setup for a sequel.

Especially the ones that look like B-movie sets?After the accidental death of his ex-wife Chase Matthews (Anthony Edwards, ""ER"", THE FORGOTTEN) and his son Jeff (Edward Furlong, T2, AMERICAN HISTORY X) move to Ludlow, Maine to start over. There he not only has to deal with his late wife's ex-boyfriend Gus who happens to be Ludlow's sherrif but his son manages to become the local outsider who's only friend in town is Gus' stepson Drew who knows just how cruel his step dad truly is. One night, Gus kills Drew's loyal German Shepard and together Drew and Jeff bury the dog beyond the Pet Sematary. The curse comes true and once again, Ludlow is cast in the horror of the supernatural as the dead return to life and begin to prey on the local population.While its first half is entertaining enough, the second half falls completely apart. According to the legend, which Zombie Gus even re-enstates to Jeff (?), you have to ""bury your own"" but that doesn't stop Zombie Scarfboy from coming back after Zombie Gus buries him. And Chase proves to be a pretty piss poor father when a week goes by after tragedy strikes again and he still has yet to see how his son is coping. Look, I get it that you're giving yourself a Pity Party over your dead ex-wife but your son is still alive and apparently going insane. Man up and help your kid. And of course Zombie Gus has no problem killing people but he has a soft spot for Jeff who knows his dirty little secret?Mary Lambert crafted a superb and very scary movie that was Pet Sematary in '89.

328829,A2T0XBQM7N923Y,6302717450,Fady Ghaly,"[1, 1]","Plot Line (partially from back cover of film)Sometimes dead is better. But the shocking terror that plagued Ludlow, Maine, in Pet Sematary, is still very much alive in this heart-pounding sequel to the original 1989 hit that grossed out several exceptional reviews and was practically proclaimed as one of Stephen King's greatest horror films yet coming out of that persistently over-filled, imaginative mind of his.After the death of his wife, veterinarian Chase Matthews (Anthony Edwards) and his thirteen-year-old son, Jeff (Edward Furlong), move to Ludlow to rebuild their lives. Antagonized by the neighborhood kids, Jeff befriends another outsider, Drew Gilbert (Jason McGuire), who lives in fear of his cruel stepfather, Gus (Clancy Brown.) After Gus cold-bloodedly shoots Drew's beloved dog, the boys go off and bury the body in the local Indian burial ground-a place rumored to have powers of resurrection. When evil is awakened, the boys realize that sometimes you should just let dead dogs lie.My remarks toward this pictureWith dark comedic references, a music score aimed at popular culture, and a director that relies more upon gore and blood-soaked special effects than an actual pr&eacute;cis, Pet Sematary Two is really intended for adolescents. For the only thing it really had in common with the original was presenting these graphical images of violence that are, however, definitely not intended for the squeamish; Steve Johnson really did a fantastic job with the makeup.In the contemplation that adolescents stood as primary characters, it, however, had not shed any sympathy toward either of them or grant them any extra care, for they were treated as equally as everyone else, which meant that...yes, you literally got to observe thirteen-year-olds getting slaughtered in the most heartless and horrid of ways. Pet Sematary Two doesn't rely on elements that would generally attract an average horror fan looking forward for  ""a good time"", for it is just a very mean-spirited and cold-hearted film without any barriers or boundaries. Average slashers, although are known for explicit violence, seem to have a soft side to them, for the killers usually depart from children; they neglect expressing their feelings of rage (what else?) upon them. But Pet Sematary Two goes all the way; it has no soft side.The thing about this film that was somewhat of a bother is, as twisted as it was, it reached an extent where it became so twisted, that it really had no major significance to it, as rules initially confirmed before as to how you awaken the dead were not only broken, but ultimately it appeared as if the dead themselves were being brought back to life for no reason at all but to merely draw blood and splatter brains all over the place; it's as if director Mary Lambert-who surprisingly is also the director of the original-was deliberately mocking the entire premise of the original film. But I'm sure that wasn't his pursuit, which would mean only one thing: that he was probably attempting to somehow recreate the story and make a film that stands out from being an actual ""sequel"", because as one-in my opinion-it was much too complex and just didn't know how far too far can go. I mean, Christ, you not only have these alleged ""soulless, maggot-luring"" zombies creating havoc and destroying innocent lives without much motive to begin with, but you have zombies that are badly portrayed by the actors who were ignominiously given this eccentric, almost vivacious persona which completely ruined the feeling; the capability of eliciting belief for their inanimate hearts just wasn't there.Nevertheless, despite its failure to have as great of an affect among viewers like myself as the original had; despite the fact that Stephen King himself, Master of the Macabre, said he wanted others to be fully aware that he had absolutely nothing to do with it, it still was a good film. This is still the sort of horror film that you can sit down and watch without having to worry about drawing a smirk on your face out of pure ridicule, for it had made its way to theaters, and although Paramount Studios is known to permit the lowest-in-budget pictures to pass on by, this one was quite worthy of the big screen, too. (Unlike the very unworthy Dr. Giggles.)And while Lambert had failed to create more authentic supernatural characters, the one thing that he hadn't was creating these two very human boys that go as far as saying things like how they couldn't believe that they've suddenly lost their beloved mother or father, and that they presumed they'd never have to undergo through such unbearable matters, as they merely assumed they happened to others, when in reality they can really happen to anyone. One day you could be some vigorous kid taking pleasure of life with those you cherish...the next, you could be some miserable wreck forever grieving over the one you thought you'd never lose.The casting crew did an amazing job in selecting just the right actors for the right rolls, and I'm chiefly referring to Jason McGuire and Edward Furlong of course. Not only because Furlong, as an Award-winning actor, delivers, but also because of the laziness of such opaque, such evil-like eyes, which perfectly suit the film's hellish subject matters, and its excessively temperamental tone. The two boys were terrific together, and had you sympathize, especially Furlong as the film progresses from his mother's death, through his moments of striving for a normal life, to his inevitable state of mind when the film comes to a climax. Rarely would a horror film do that, but not every horror film is entitled ""Pet Sematary Two"", which, despite its flaws, was true to the human soul.",4,Fady Ghaly's reviews,1005177600,"11 8,

Once again, Lambert paints a disturbingly dark and morbid picture in part two of this horror movie series.Basically, the plot centers around a young boy played by Edward Furlong who is absolutely devastated by his mother's grisly demise...naturally, he would do anything to get his mother back and eventually does.  The basic premise behind this movie appears to be that the evil force behind the pet sematary is calling upon Furlong's character to resort to the pet sematary to bring back his mother along with some incredible evil as well.Overall, the movie works a good bit like the original and while it is certainly an entertaining enough movie for horror movie fans, the sequel is not nearly as effective as the original.  One strong area that the original ""Pet Sematary"" had was the very interesting character of Jud played very well by Fred Gwynne...Jud's character carries the momentum of each scene in the original and basically made ""Pet Sematary"" work, but we don't have that strong character presence to make the wheels go round in this sequel, therefore the movie comes across flat.  What we do have in this sequel is an average horror movie that attempts to cash in on the success of the original classic.Perhaps, the characters in ""Pet Sematary II"" are just weak in general (no disrespect to Clancy Brown or Anthony Edwards), but something is missing here in part two of this series despite the similarities in the dark and disturbing atmosphere painted so meticulously by Lambert.  Quite frankly, I did not like the casting of Edward Furlong as the main character to begin with...I don't know but it just left a bad taste in my mouth about this movie...he's such an uncharasmatic dork and his hard to sympathize with, notwithstanding the obvious limitations of his acting abilities.The bottom line is that due to the lack of quality characters present in ""Pet Sematary Two"", the sequel just isn't near as compelling as the original.  Because ""Pet Sematary Two"" isn't anywhere near as good, nor as emotionally compelling as the original classic.  Indeed, one is left to wonder if a sequel was a smart move here.  Still, with that being said, ""Pet Sematary Two"" is not a terrible movie and so I give it TWO STARS which means it's just fair or average, but I would be remiss if I did not say that I've certainly seen a lot worse...just check out some of my other reviews and see what I mean.",2,"Dark, morbid and disturbing, but lacking that special something that made the original great.",1127433600,"09 23, 2005",2005,2578,"['Pet', 'Sematary', 'Two', 'was', 'directed', 'same', 'Mary', 'Lambert', 'who', 'directed', 'original', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'similarities', 'style', 'are', 'clearly', 'evident', 'two', 'movies', 'Once', 'again', 'Lambert', 'disturbingly', 'dark', 'morbid', 'picture', 'part', 'two', 'horror', 'movie', 'series.Basically', 'plot', 'centers', 'young', 'boy', 'played', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'who', 'absolutely', 'devastated', 'mother', 'grisly', 'demise', 'naturally', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'mother', 'back', 'eventually', 'basic', 'premise', 'movie', 'be', 'evil', 'force', 'pet', 'sematary', 'calling', 'Furlong', 'character', 'resort', 'pet', 'sematary', 'bring', 'back', 'mother', 'incredible', 'evil', 'well.Overall', 'movie', 'good', 'bit', 'original', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'fans', 'sequel', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'effective', 'original', 'One', 'strong', 'area', 'original', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'had', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'Jud', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'Jud', 'character', 'momentum', 'scene', 'original', 'basically', 'made', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'strong', 'character', 'presence', 'make', 'wheels', 'go', 'round', 'sequel', 'movie', 'flat', 'What', 'do', 'have', 'sequel', 'average', 'horror', 'movie', 'cash', 'success', 'original', 'classic.Perhaps', 'characters', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'II', 'are', 'just', 'weak', 'general', 'disrespect', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'something', 'missing', 'here', 'part', 'two', 'series', 'similarities', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'atmosphere', 'painted', 'so', 'meticulously', 'Lambert', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'did', 'not', 'casting', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'main', 'character', 'begin', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'left', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'movie', 'such', 'uncharasmatic', 'dork', 'hard', 'sympathize', 'notwithstanding', 'obvious', 'limitations', 'acting', 'abilities.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'due', 'lack', 'quality', 'characters', 'present', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'Two', 'sequel', 'just', ""n't"", 'near', 'as', 'compelling', 'original', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'Two', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'as', 'good', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'original', 'classic', 'Indeed', 'one', 'left', 'wonder', 'sequel', 'was', 'smart', 'move', 'here', 'Still', 'being', 'said', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'Two', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'so', 'give', 'TWO', 'STARS', 'just', 'fair', 'average', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'did', 'not', 'say', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'seen', 'lot', 'worse', 'just', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'reviews', 'see', 'what', 'mean']",N/A

SCORE:  3THE CAST:  I've never been a fan of Edward Furlong, but this is the first time he didn't tick me off through the whole movie; he obviously enjoys playing the cynical, dark, deep kid; Anthony Edwards is ineffectual, too zombielike; Clancy Brown is marvelous as Gus, especially when he returns from the dead; Jared Rushton (Big) is good, too, as the psychotic to be Clyde; and Darlanne Flugel is richly exotic as Furlong's dead mother.SCORE;  4TECHNICALLY:  Up and down; the effects of the dog are sometimes good, and other times, very noticeably inept; the score does nothing to enhance the film, but when you're marketing for teenagers, it's inevitable; direction is a little slow at times.

It's the town where his parents were from, and it also just happens to be the same town in which the entire Creed family met their tragic deaths a few years earlier. And, just as with the Creeds, Jeff, his father, and his new friend Drew will succumb to the deadly curse that is the Pet Sematary, a local bit of cursed ground that brings the dead back to life, but not as they were before. When someone is buried in the Pet Semetary, they come back evil and dangerous!The first &#34;Pet Semetary&#34;, penned by Stephen King, is a horror classic, and deservedly so, despite the fact that the little girl in the film, whose role is pretty major, annoys the heck outta me. It's well written, acted, and truly disturbing and frightening. &#34;Pet Sematary 2&#34; is a film I suppose you either love or hate. The acting is fine, for the most part, very good in some cases, and while the story may be a bit less mature, it is still highly entertaining! It's not as scary as the original film, but it is still creepy and engaging. Edward Furlong is the focal point of the film as Jeff, and he does a good job carrying the picture, while the show does get stolen a bit by Clancy Brown as the ominous and unpleasant Sheriff Gus, Drew's cold and abusive step-father. &#34;Pet Sematary 2&#34; may not be on the level of the first film overall, but in some ways I might even like it more. It's just, well, more fun to watch. It's not as scary, as I said, but it's still pretty dark and messed up. The climax gets a bit hokey, but it's one heck of a ride I do recommend. Go into this one for some great popcorn horror, go to the first for some real Stephen King type stuff.This DVD, by the way, is widescreen and perfectly suitable, but nothing spectacular. The only bonus feature is the trailer, and I have to shake my head at it for that. It's more than some films get, but far less than any film should on any format above VHS.

The characters in this movie are just plain stupid. The acting is bland and the story is backwards. The characters who die and come back to life have more personality as a reincarnated corpse than they did when they were alive. How insane is that? Plus this movie leaves questions unanswered? Why would Gus bury Clyde in the sacred burial ground after he killed him? It makes no sense as is the son who buries his abusive stepfather in the same burial site.

Jeff Matthews moves to the town of Ludlow with his father after his Hollywood star mother is accidentally killed while making a horror movie. Jeff makes friends with a local boy named Drew who has a dog named Zowie and a mean stepfather named Gus, who also happens to be the sheriff in Ludlow. When Gus shoots Drew's dog, Drew takes Jeff with him to bury the dog in the Indian burial ground that's next to the local Pet Sematary. When the dog comes back from the dead, Jeff begins to wonder if he should bury his mother in the burial ground.
