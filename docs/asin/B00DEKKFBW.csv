How about shamanic journeys, out-of-body experiences, astral worlds, etc? In a sense, ""Ancient Aliens"" mimic the literalness of the fundamentalism they are trying to expose, a literalness which in some cases might have been purely ""exoteric"".

I often scoff at the logical leaps the show makes, but I find myself rewatching the episodes repeatedly nonetheless. My 3-star review doesn't reflect my opinion of the show; it's a criticism of the way season five has been released.I don't watch the program in its original television run. I wait for the whole season to become available on Amazon's streaming video service. Generally it's cheaper to buy once the whole season is complete. But not this time around.People here have been complaining about the DVD version being labeled &#34;Season 5: Volume 1.&#34; They say that there were only 12 episodes in season five and all are included in volume one. Amazon's streaming service disagrees; it lists 15 episodes in season five and has already begun compiling season six. Despite this, it's impossible to buy the full season five for one lump price; you have to purchase each episode individually.So are there 12 episodes in season five, or are there 15? Why do the DVDs contain 12 episodes but call them volume one? Surely they're not going to release three episodes on a separate disk and call that volume two. Who is it that can't count?

1655408,A2A7XY78RAM5H5,B00DEKKFBW,"Karl E. Weaver ""karlweaver""","[0, 0]","It's always risky to write a negative review so please, you avid fans, go easy a bit.  I watched Seasons 1 and 2 (and 3?) of Ancient Aliens on DVD and didn't realize there were more; then noted Seasons 4 and 5 had been released.  I started watching Season 5 disc one without even noticing I had skipped over season 4, but it hardly mattered.  The episodes on disc 1 kinda circled around some of the same stories I had heard in seasons 1-3, with mostly the same commentators as well (always referred to as &#34;ancient alien theorists&#34;).  There are a couple of problems with this series coming from the History Channel.  First and obviously, it portrays versions of history which are, let's say, wildly controversial without ever (that I've seen so far) putting on a genuine critic of these theories.  Second, an annoying habit (still present in Season 5) of throwing out what most professionals in the field would probably say are wild ideas, posed as a question, then saying, &#34;Perhaps the answer lies HALF A WORLD AWAY...over HERE...and switching to another story.  As in: Did ancient pyramids serve as power stations for extraterrestrial space stations, etc?  Perhaps the answer lies half a world away...Probably most of the people that would faithfully watch all 5 seasons are already avid believers, and I fear my efforts to persuade anyone who thinks all of this is bunk, are unlikely to convince them to watch.  Let me give 2 examples of stories from disc 1 season 5 which are particularly interesting, portray some counter-arguments, and then try to portray why I think this series is worth watching even if you do not believe 90% of the theories put forward:Season five includes a discussion of what are purported to be the largest and maybe the oldest pyramids in the world, at Visoko which in northwest of Sarajevo.  A native who relocated to Texas, USA named Sam Osmanogich, was excavating them several years ago, and proclaimed the largest one, the &#34;Pyramid of the Sun&#34;, to be almost twice as tall as the great pyramid at Giza.  Furthermore, he claimed that analysis of the mortar between stone blocks gave it an age of possibly around 12,500 years, which would make it the oldest extant pyramid.  Almost no mainstream archaeologist agrees with him and the show presents a straightforward reason why: because the question would naturally arise: who BUILT pyramids that old?Well if you do a little online &#34;digging&#34; into these claims, I have to conclude that Mr. Osmanogich's claims don't hold up well.  I agree, certainly in the film these look like large pyramids, which have been covered over by vegetation.  Other archaeologists claim they are actually hills of natural formation, and that there are hundreds of similar hills, including in the US.  Osmanogich claims the entire surface of the pyramids was covered over with man-made  (or artificially made) concrete which is about 3 times the quality of concrete made today.  Some archaeologists claim it is not concrete at all but a type of &#34;brecchia&#34;: stones which by water action ended up resting in a bed of clay or sand, which eventually hardened into solid stones.  By &#34;three times the quality of modern cement&#34;, he appears to mean its much lower absorption of water as well as durability.He claims to have found an extensive network of &#34;tunnels&#34; which connect at least 3 of the pyramids which he is excavating (because, he says, subsequent water action flooded much of the original tunnels).  A different view of what he is doing is taking some very small gaps between rocks, and excavating them until they look like real tunnels.  Given enough time and money I'm sure he would have an extensive network of tunnels between the hills.  I read elsewhere that first he claimed these were around 12,000 years old, then retracted that statement and indicated they could be from anywhere to around 12,000 to 4 or 5,000 years old, and actually younger than the pyramids at Giza.Others have observed his &#34;excavations&#34; appear to be remodeling the hills, so that they look more like south American &#34;step pyramids&#34;.  In short, that these excavations are In order to make them appear more man-made.  The closest I found to any independent agreement with his ideas, was a statement by another researcher that humans, centuries ago, did in fact do some shaping of the natural hills, to make them appear more pyramidal than they originally were shaped.  As far as the names: Pyramid of the Sun, the Moon, the Serpent: they all were given those names by Osmanogich himself.  As I suspect is true of many of the other speakers, the series leaves out their more frankly bizarre statements, which would tend to make them lose credibility, such as a statement by Osmanohich that Hitler and his commanders were not killed, but escaped to Antarctica where they live in a secret complex...In summary, Osmanogich himself does not have any credibility.How about the assertion that the aliens who gave us technology to build great pyramids came &#34;from Orion's belt&#34; because temples and structures around the world have a pattern matichg Orion's belt.  Well this too does not hold up to scrutiny.  Three main stars make up the &#34;belt&#34;: Alnitak, actually a triple star system about 736 light-years from earth.  The largest of the 3 stars is said to be the largest, brightest &#34;type O&#34; star in the northern sky and is estimated at about 28 times the volume of our sun.  The second star, a smaller blue star, rotates around it in a slow orbit taking about 1500 years.  The third star is further from the first two and less bright.  The middle star in the belt is Anilam, about 1300 light years from earth.  The one on the left side is Mintaka and is about 916 light years from eath and is actually a 4-star complex.  The two closest stars rotate around each other about every 5.7 days.  In short, &#34;Orion's belt&#34; is not a location at all; the 3 stars happen to look adjacent from our position.  The &#34;Orion nebula&#34; briefly mentioned, is lower down and actually the middle &#34;star&#34; of the 3 representing the dagger slung from his belt.  It's quite a cluster--the closest to earth, and has a high density of around 2,000 stars in an area roughly 20 light-years in diameter.  Almost all the stars there must be younger than ours and had less time to develop an advanced civilization.  The colors of the nebula are interesting: blue from the light of hot blue stars reflected through the gas, red from H-alpha recombinations, and green from a reaction impossible on earth: a highly unlikely electron transition in doubly-ionized gas.The incident at the RAF base near Rendlesham Forest, though it has somewhat more credibility to it, is difficult to interpret and I found it perhaps the most interesting so far in season 5.What I'd like to say about Season 5 and all of them together, is that you do not have to believe everything in the show for it to be worth watching.  You may learn a lot more history and geography, even if you don't believe any of the explanations put forward--and you'll probably realize there's a lot that we simply do now know yet, and cannot

I had wondered whether there had been alien abduction and conspiracy involved in them missing off the shelf?  We got pristine blu ray with season one, then they skipped season two & three to resume the format with season four only to abandon it again with season five!  I have decided after much investigation &#34;They&#34; which includes Georgio the Einstein wannabe, doesn't care just as long as the gravy keeps running.  No one at the History channel can answer why this has been done nor can say when 'if ever' blu rays will be produced.  When you try enquire via Georgio's magazine you're told to contact the History channel; so he's either clueless, has no say in production or don't give a flying fig!  I think it's probably all of the above, he even failed to respond to the question when asked directly on twitter a couple of weeks back.So for one who refuses to mix and match dvd's and blu rays on a shelf after we've been sold this new format to upgrade our libraries yet again, will refuse to buy seasons 2, 3 and 5 until someone resolves this idiocy!

Some of the stuff is so crazy I gave this season four stars.  The crazies things they show are the blocks of stone.  The one piece stone towers, the gapless cut stone structures and the huge stone empty boxes in pyramids that all look the strangely similar all over the earth.  It does not prove that there were alien construction workers making things that do nothing today as far as we can tell.  The research does prove that ancient man was able to cut and lift stone far better than we are today.
