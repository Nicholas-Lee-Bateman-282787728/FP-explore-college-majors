Ya it's kind of campy and corny in spots, but the characters are very engaging and I really like the moral lessons.I strongly recommend watching the series in order as they build off of each other.I heard that they were going to make a live action movie based on this.

Don't get me wrong, I love the show.  It has action, plot, comedy and romance (though I'm not so big on the last one.)  It even has the unique quality of realism to it, by what I mean is that it follows the set of ground rules that was originally placed there.  Plus, the bad guys get a victory every now and then.The reason I was tempted to rate it 1 star was simply because I hate how they keep coming out with these individual DVDs.  By the time Book 2 finally comes out on DVD as a set, the 3rd book will probably be half way through.  I say ignore these individual volumes and go for the whole enchilada at the end.  Still, until people stop buying them, we're just going to have to put up with these individual volumes for a little while longer.",5,Thoroughly Enjoyable,1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,898,"['Now', 'originally', 'was', 'going', 'rate', 'only', '1', 'star', 'then', 'figured', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'guy', 'who', 'rated', 'Avatar', 'anything', '4', 'stars', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'show', 'action', 'plot', 'comedy', 'romance', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'big', 'last', 'one', 'even', 'unique', 'quality', 'realism', 'what', 'mean', 'set', 'ground', 'rules', 'was', 'originally', 'placed', 'there', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'victory', 'now', 'then.The', 'reason', 'was', 'tempted', 'rate', '1', 'star', 'was', 'simply', 'hate', 'how', 'keep', 'coming', 'out', 'individual', 'DVDs', 'time', 'Book', '2', 'finally', 'out', 'DVD', 'set', '3rd', 'book', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'half', 'way', 'say', 'individual', 'volumes', 'go', 'whole', 'enchilada', 'end', 'Still', 'people', 'stop', 'buying', ""'re"", 'just', 'going', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'individual', 'volumes', 'little', 'longer']","Avatar The Last Airbender - Book 2 Earth, Vol. 3"
