I've been searching for years for this movie in DVD format.  The delivery was fast and was happy to get the DVD to add to my collection.  Of course, it's not the high-quality DVD we're so use to these days, as what you get is what was aired exactly on TV.  However, that is part of its' charm, when programs like this were regular fare on TV.  These days with all the nonsense of Reality TV, it makes me appreciate even more the days when you got a good story.  I would recommend anyone to buy this for their collection.  It still holds up, after all these years.",4,Small Sacrifices the DVD,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,778,"['remember', 'seeing', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'Diane', 'Downes', 'case', 'when', 'first', 'aired', '80', 'always', 'remembered', 'how', 'well', 'acted', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'especially', 'was', 'based', 'real-life', 'occurrence', ""'ve"", 'been', 'searching', 'years', 'movie', 'DVD', 'format', 'delivery', 'was', 'fast', 'was', 'happy', 'get', 'DVD', 'add', 'collection', 'course', 'not', 'high-quality', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'so', 'use', 'days', 'what', 'get', 'what', 'was', 'aired', 'exactly', 'TV', 'However', 'part', 'charm', 'when', 'programs', 'were', 'regular', 'fare', 'TV', 'days', 'nonsense', 'Reality', 'TV', 'appreciate', 'even', 'more', 'days', 'when', 'got', 'good', 'story', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'buy', 'collection', 'still', 'up', 'years']",N/A

One of the three children dies and the other two are afflicted physically and emotionally, probably for life.The acting, writing, directing, pacing, suspense, are excellent--Farah Fawsett especially so in her manipulative, callous disregard for anyone else but herself in her desire for sensual pleasure and control of men at the expense of other people's happiness.The courtroom drama was very well done, slowly building to an emotionally fulfilling climax.

260187,A2IAR5XDY0KT2F,6301653114,Becky,"[36, 38]","Movies based upon books are usually not much good, but &quot;Small Sacrifices&quot; is the exception to the rule.  Farrah Fawcett delivers a stellar performance as Diane Downs, an Oregon mother who was convicted in  mid 1984 for the May 1983 slaying of one of her children and the attempted  murders of the other two, all because she was trying to win back the  affections of her married lover, who had broken off their affair because he  didn't want to be a daddy.  Fawcett absolutely excels as Diane Downs  because she brings to life Downs's coldness, self absorption, disregard for  her children, and psychopathology in an extremely compelling and realistic  fashion.  John Shea is also commanding as the intense prosecutor, who,  convinced of Downs's guilt from the very beginning, relentlessly seeks  justice, and not because he feels he has only a legal obligation to do so.  Joyce Eliason based her fabulous screenplay on Ann's Rule's bestselling  book of the same name.  This is an emotional movie, vey tough to watch, and  will leave you drained at the end, simply because it is such a hard  hitting, spellbinding story about the awful crime committed by a cold  blooded woman who never should have been blessed with the gift of children.",5,As good as the book!,962236800,"06 29, 2000",2000,1247,"['Movies', 'based', 'books', 'are', 'usually', 'not', 'much', 'good', 'quot', 'Small', 'Sacrifices', 'quot', 'exception', 'rule', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Diane', 'Downs', 'Oregon', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'convicted', 'mid', '1984', 'May', '1983', 'slaying', 'one', 'children', 'attempted', 'murders', 'other', 'two', 'was', 'trying', 'win', 'back', 'affections', 'married', 'lover', 'who', 'had', 'broken', 'off', 'affair', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'daddy', 'Fawcett', 'absolutely', 'Diane', 'Downs', 'life', 'Downs', 'coldness', 'absorption', 'disregard', 'children', 'psychopathology', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'realistic', 'fashion', 'John', 'Shea', 'also', 'commanding', 'intense', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'convinced', 'Downs', 'guilt', 'very', 'beginning', 'relentlessly', 'justice', 'not', 'only', 'legal', 'obligation', 'do', 'so', 'Joyce', 'Eliason', 'based', 'fabulous', 'screenplay', 'Ann', 'Rule', 'bestselling', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'emotional', 'movie', 'vey', 'tough', 'watch', 'will', 'leave', 'drained', 'end', 'simply', 'such', 'hard', 'hitting', 'spellbinding', 'story', 'awful', 'crime', 'committed', 'cold', 'blooded', 'woman', 'who', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'blessed', 'gift', 'children']",N/A

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[41, 41]","The small screen treatment of author Ann Rule's best-seller is all the more gut-wrenching because this really happened, a self-absorbed mother whose horrific act of violence against her own children (all for a boyfriend who, it turned out, couldn't wait to unload her?) commanded overdue attention to the threat to children in their own homes. For anyone still unconvinced by ""The Burning Bed"" that Farrah Fawcett can act better than she can jiggle, they won't be with this one. Fawcett is superlative in getting across the pathological selfishness of Diane Downs and how her children paid for it. The performance was, for Fawcett, a richly earned Emmy nomination. Despite more than ample supporting acting by the likes of John Shea, et al, Fawcett carries this production and highlights it with an indelible emotional wallop. This is an important social piece, much as is ""The Burning Bed"" remains, and forces us to examine our childrens' safety in a new light. Read Rule's book for background to appreciate the production's faithfulness to its subject matter.

260191,AUFK6UT2DU87H,6301653114,"Meredith L. Burton ""Bookworm""","[3, 3]","""Small Sacrifices"" is a haunting depiction of the life of Diane Downes, a woman convicted of the brutal attempted murder of her three children.  One child, Shawna, was killed, and Karen and Robbie were emotionally and physically maimed by a ruthless sociopath whose obsession with a married man resulted in unspeakable evil.  This movie was riveting from start to finish.  Staying extremely close to the case study by crime writer Anne Rule, the film is truly unforgettable.  I was particularly struck by the courage exemplified by Diane's little girl, Karen, who, though at first unable to speak because of fear, is ultimately able to tell the truth despite the horrific trauma in her life.  We as viewers see that good ultimately triumphs when the prosecutor and his wife take steps to ensure that Robbie and Karen will have a loving home.The acting in this miniseries is unsurpassed.  Farrah Fawcett is mesmerizing as Diane, bringing to life a chillingly childlike psychotic personality.  Her little-girl persona is horrifying yet heartbreaking: a spoiled individual determined to get what she wants despite the cost.  The other actors turn in stellar performances, particularly the man portraying the prosecutor and the little girl who portrays Karen.Please give this wonderful and unforgettable film a chance.

260193,A2X25C107CSLOR,6301653114,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[12, 17]","This TVM directed by David Greene is based on the book by Anne Rule and the teleplay adapted by Joyce Eliason. The female contribution accounts for the stance taken on Diane Downs, an Oregon postal worker who in 1983 was accused of murdering her own children to free herself for a lover who &quot;just don't wanna be a Daddy&quot;. The crime outrages the male DA's assistant and presecutor with it's seemingly Medea brutality, their suspicion of Diane raised, in spite of her claim of a &quot;bushy haired stranger&quot; being responsible for the shootings, based on her &quot;weird&quot; behaviour. This behaviour is said to include a lack of emotion, inopportune humour, and a taste for the Duran Duran song Hungry Like the Wolf. (Greene's attempt to make Diane the wolf via her car headlights as eyes is a bit much). The DA's office takes months to form their case against Downs, and in their frustration, resent Diane's use of the media to gain sympathy, though we hear someone comment that &quot;the camera loves her&quot;, implying that she possesses an unnatural empathy. At one point the audience becomes the TV camera with Diane talking to us subjectively. Given the nature of the context, it's easy for Downs to be more sympathetic than the police who wish to do her harm, but this perceived unbalance in the light of their feeling about the crime isn't helped by Greene's casting of John Shea as the DA's assistant and prosecutor, who specialises in a wooden stare. Eliason's teleplay reduces Downs by having someone say &quot;She doesn't love. She devours&quot; and gives her a memory monologue that she inexplicably delivers to Shea where she confesses that she hates men. There is also a court opportunity for Shea to project all his bile, and a queasy plot point of Shea's interest in Diane's children, overstepping his professionalism and getting way too personally involved. Greene uses similar cutaways of a crowd outside the courtroom during the trial, and stages a court re-enactment of the shootings in a model car for the camera with projected crosscuts, that the jury is unable to see.As Downs, Farrah Fawcett has some delicious moments. Although an actress whose effort is always obvious, she captures Diane's recklessness and beauty, as she walks down a hallway talking and passing Shea, and as the camera circles her when a psychiatrist gives an evaluation of her personality. If she says and does things that appear to deliberately make herself look bad in the eyes of others, she still retains tube empathy so that we don't want to see her be found guilty, perhaps because only seeing her doing the shooting through the eyes of the prosecutor, helps it remain unreal. The casting of Ryan O'Neal as her former lover allows her to be uninhibited with him, though funny because of his resistance. There is also a perversity in the casting since it represents them at a time when they were a real life couple, but his stock was falling as hers was rising.This TVM originally ran at 186 mins which is the version I saw, but ironically the length works against the treatment. In spite of it being truthful to the length of time the real events took, the inbalance of empathy becomes even stronger, and while we wait and wait with the police for Down's surviving daughter to regain her speech so she can stand as a witness against her mother, Fawcett's achievements become Greene's own small sacrifices.",3,a true story,1001376000,"09 25, 2001",2001,3424,"['TVM', 'directed', 'David', 'Greene', 'based', 'book', 'Anne', 'Rule', 'teleplay', 'adapted', 'Joyce', 'Eliason', 'female', 'contribution', 'accounts', 'stance', 'taken', 'Diane', 'Downs', 'Oregon', 'postal', 'worker', 'who', '1983', 'was', 'accused', 'murdering', 'own', 'children', 'free', 'lover', 'who', 'quot', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'Daddy', 'quot', 'crime', 'male', 'DA', 'assistant', 'presecutor', 'seemingly', 'Medea', 'brutality', 'suspicion', 'Diane', 'raised', 'spite', 'claim', 'quot', 'haired', 'stranger', 'quot', 'being', 'responsible', 'shootings', 'based', 'quot', 'quot', 'behaviour', 'behaviour', 'said', 'include', 'lack', 'emotion', 'inopportune', 'humour', 'taste', 'Duran', 'Duran', 'song', 'Hungry', 'Wolf', 'Greene', 'attempt', 'make', 'Diane', 'wolf', 'car', 'headlights', 'eyes', 'bit', 'much', 'DA', 'office', 'months', 'form', 'case', 'Downs', 'frustration', 'resent', 'Diane', 'use', 'media', 'gain', 'sympathy', 'hear', 'someone', 'comment', 'quot', 'camera', 'quot', 'implying', 'unnatural', 'empathy', 'one', 'point', 'audience', 'TV', 'camera', 'Diane', 'talking', 'subjectively', 'Given', 'nature', 'context', 'easy', 'Downs', 'be', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'police', 'who', 'do', 'harm', 'perceived', 'unbalance', 'light', 'feeling', 'crime', ""n't"", 'helped', 'Greene', 'casting', 'John', 'Shea', 'DA', 'assistant', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'wooden', 'stare', 'Eliason', 'teleplay', 'reduces', 'Downs', 'having', 'someone', 'say', 'quot', ""n't"", 'love', 'quot', 'memory', 'monologue', 'inexplicably', 'delivers', 'Shea', 'where', 'men', 'also', 'court', 'opportunity', 'Shea', 'project', 'bile', 'queasy', 'plot', 'point', 'Shea', 'interest', 'Diane', 'children', 'overstepping', 'professionalism', 'getting', 'way', 'too', 'personally', 'involved', 'Greene', 'similar', 'cutaways', 'crowd', 'courtroom', 'trial', 'court', 're-enactment', 'shootings', 'model', 'car', 'camera', 'projected', 'crosscuts', 'jury', 'unable', 'see.As', 'Downs', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'delicious', 'moments', 'actress', 'effort', 'always', 'obvious', 'Diane', 'recklessness', 'beauty', 'down', 'hallway', 'talking', 'passing', 'Shea', 'camera', 'when', 'psychiatrist', 'evaluation', 'personality', 'things', 'appear', 'deliberately', 'make', 'look', 'bad', 'eyes', 'others', 'still', 'tube', 'empathy', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'be', 'found', 'guilty', 'perhaps', 'only', 'seeing', 'doing', 'shooting', 'eyes', 'prosecutor', 'remain', 'unreal', 'casting', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'former', 'lover', 'be', 'uninhibited', 'though', 'funny', 'resistance', 'also', 'perversity', 'casting', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'real', 'life', 'couple', 'stock', 'was', 'falling', 'hers', 'was', 'rising.This', 'TVM', 'originally', 'ran', '186', 'mins', 'version', 'saw', 'ironically', 'length', 'treatment', 'spite', 'being', 'truthful', 'length', 'time', 'real', 'events', 'took', 'inbalance', 'empathy', 'becomes', 'even', 'stronger', 'wait', 'wait', 'police', 'Down', 'surviving', 'daughter', 'regain', 'speech', 'can', 'stand', 'witness', 'mother', 'Fawcett', 'achievements', 'become', 'Greene', 'own', 'small', 'sacrifices']",N/A
