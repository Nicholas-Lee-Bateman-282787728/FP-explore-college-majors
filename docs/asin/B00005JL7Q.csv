596403,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JL7Q,A Customer,"[1, 4]","Hugh Grant is great and the writing is fun.Summary:Will (Hugh Grant) does nothing.  He has no job because he is living off of the proceeds of a song his father wrote (Super Sleigh Ride or something like that).  He has never had a job.  And, he is a playboy.  He enjoys chasing women.Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) is a young boy who has a lot of problems.  His mother, Fiona (Toni Collette) is a depressed treehugger (I used that affectionately because I am a treehugger) that is raising him to be different which is resulting in him having no friends.Will, at close to 40, finally hits on the idea of chasing single moms.  He ends up pursuing a friend of Fiona's who is taking care of Marcus one afternoon.  When they take Marcus home after a picnic together, they find Fiona nearly dead from a suicide attempt.  Though Fiona survives, Marcus gets it in his head that what his mother needs is a boyfriend, so he tries to set her up with Will.  It doesn't click, at all, but Marcus eventually becomes friends with Will.  Will tries to help him out by teaching him how to not be quite so different from everyone else and Marcus helps Will realize that he does want and need people in his life.  Will eventually ends up finding a woman he likes and really wants to keep around and Will makes friends.My Comments:The premise is fun and the movie keeps you very interested, despite Will not 'doing anything'.  Hugh Grant is hilarious.  The movie is very insightful and does a great job of teasing out the bizarre life that Will has created for himself.  Though the other actors are good for the most part (there are some awkward points with Nicholas Hoult where it just doesn't work), Hugh Grant really does steal the show.Ultimately the movie ends up being about friendship and love and needing people to survive in this world (and I guess, in a sense, about growing up).  It is a good message that is a bit overt but not overly so.  The movie is fun, but never really enters into the realm of emotionally compelling (at least it didn't for me).  I would recommend it.  It is a very fun romantic comedy, though the romance is really more between Will and Marcus and their relationship than it is between Will and his love interest.",3,A fun 'romantic' comedy,1044662400,"02 8, 2003",2003,2221,"['Hugh', 'Grant', 'great', 'writing', 'fun.Summary', 'Will', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'nothing', 'job', 'living', 'proceeds', 'song', 'father', 'wrote', 'Super', 'Sleigh', 'Ride', 'something', 'never', 'had', 'job', 'playboy', 'chasing', 'women.Marcus', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'lot', 'problems', 'mother', 'Fiona', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'depressed', 'treehugger', 'used', 'affectionately', 'am', 'treehugger', 'raising', 'be', 'different', 'resulting', 'having', 'friends.Will', 'close', '40', 'finally', 'idea', 'chasing', 'single', 'moms', 'up', 'pursuing', 'friend', 'Fiona', 'who', 'taking', 'care', 'Marcus', 'one', 'afternoon', 'When', 'take', 'Marcus', 'home', 'picnic', 'together', 'find', 'Fiona', 'nearly', 'dead', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Fiona', 'Marcus', 'head', 'what', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'set', 'up', 'Will', ""n't"", 'click', 'Marcus', 'eventually', 'friends', 'Will', 'Will', 'help', 'out', 'teaching', 'how', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'so', 'different', 'everyone', 'else', 'Marcus', 'Will', 'realize', 'want', 'need', 'people', 'life', 'Will', 'eventually', 'up', 'finding', 'woman', 'really', 'keep', 'Will', 'friends.My', 'Comments', 'premise', 'fun', 'movie', 'very', 'interested', 'Will', 'not', ""'doing"", 'anything', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'very', 'insightful', 'great', 'job', 'teasing', 'out', 'bizarre', 'life', 'Will', 'created', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'awkward', 'points', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'where', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'really', 'steal', 'show.Ultimately', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'friendship', 'love', 'needing', 'people', 'survive', 'world', 'guess', 'sense', 'growing', 'up', 'good', 'message', 'bit', 'overt', 'not', 'overly', 'so', 'movie', 'fun', 'never', 'really', 'realm', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', 'recommend', 'very', 'fun', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'romance', 'really', 'more', 'Will', 'Marcus', 'relationship', 'Will', 'love', 'interest']",About a Boy

I saw this in the movie theatre with my best friend when it was released back in 2002, and I was surprised by how good Grant's acting was. It really shows his depth and vulnerability for such a serious and understood part. Grant plays a playboy who decides to seduce women who are single parents so he pretends he is a single parent too to date these ""desperate women."" Along the way he forms an unexpected friendship with a strange boy who is looking for a father figure. Toni Collete and Rachel Weisz also star. Grant's character begins to grow-up and realize what is important and that is having people you love close to you and opening yourself up to life's little disasters.

596407,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JL7Q,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","When I first saw `About a Boy' I found myself slightly underwhelmed.  I wanted to like it and knew that I was supposed to, but I just didn't really care.  That was a few years ago.  Then, about a year ago, I caught it on cable and, while I only caught the last half, I found myself wrapped up in it.Then I bought it.Now I love it.This is definitely a film that has grown on my ridiculous amounts and I now consider it one of the best of 2002, definitely top ten and at times I even consider it top 5 (I so wish I was still doing my awards, but then again, I'm glad I'm not).  It has so much depth to it, if you are willing to give it the time of day.  It can, and does at times, appear to be just another romantic comedy, and it does have those elements (thank you Rachel Weisz), but there is so much more here than just a generic `boy meets girl'.  The main point of this story is self awareness, and it is handled in such a fun and beautifully touching way.That `Killing Me Softly' finale just hits me where it counts.The film tells of selfish womanizer Will who preys on single mothers by attending single parent groups.  It's at one of these groups that he meets young Marcus, who is in serious need of some male attention.  His mother, Fiona, is a bit unstable (or a lot unstable) and somewhat suicidal, and her chronic depression is almost too much for Marcus.  So, after making the first move, Marcus ends up finding a companion in Will.  Will, who is quite aware that he is shallow and self consumed, is stunned that he is finally putting someone else's feelings above his own; but of course that is a life change that will not come easy.Hugh Grant is a great comedian and has proven himself numerous times for me.  I was not sold on him entirely a few years ago, but over time he has really grown on me.  From his priceless pairing with Bullock to his nomination worthy performance in `Four Wedding and a Funeral', not to mention memorable and charming turns in fluff films like `Music and Lyrics' (such a cute albeit forgettable film), Grant has really perfected his charm.  This is his finest moment, easy.  He is funny and charming and even a tad sleazy, but he manages to capture this man's heart and convey this feeling of want and vulnerability that really helps sell this movie to the audience.  Toni Collette is really good, but I do feel as though love for this performance in particular is a little overrated.  She is wonderful always, but she isn't breathtaking here.  I preferred Rachel Weisz.  Young Nicholas Hoult is just `pinch me' cute here, you just want to give him a gigantic hug and tell him everything will be all right.Like I said, that `Killing Me Softly' scene is just a tearjerker.So, in the end I'm gushing.  Give this one a try if you haven't, and if you have and you're still not sure then watch it again.

But, luckily, About a Boy is one of Grant's better films, more for the comedy than anything else.The only real flaw about the movie is that Hugh Grant's character is a little too annoying.  Sure, I know that he's supposed to be a little unlikeable, but I think they went a little too far.

He is at his most charming when he is asked what he does and gets one of those ""aw shucks"" looks before admitting that he does....nothing. He resorts to going to a single-parents' meeting and inventing a son in order to meet a woman. In the meantime, he forms a reluctant friendship with Marcus, an odd young boy whose mother is raising him alone. This relationship with Marcus is the heart of the movie and is the basis for Will's coming of age..Other reviewers have gone into the story-line of the movie more than adequately, so I don't need to do that again.This is a fresh take on an old theme with characters you can like and a lot of laughs. How this all comes together is delightful, which is a credit to all who worked on this film.

E Jackson,"[2, 2]","Quite possibly Hugh Grant's best ever performance, About a Boy is both funny and enticing.There's two elements to the storyline.The most obvious one (and the one I honestly believed would dominate most of the storyline but I was wrong) deals with Hugh Grant playing the role of a single guy who's always interested in meeting women, and seems to be proud of the fact he has no life or any real motivation to do anything.  Somehow, he always impresses the ladies and they don't seem to care about the fact he does nothing but sits around watching television all day.The next part of the storyline is the superior one because it involves Grant's character getting to know a little boy who continues to visit him.  We actually get to see a good chunk of the little boys character and all his many problems (constantly getting picked on in school, having other kids throw rocks at him while returning home, and a constant need to fit in by listening to rap music).Actually the message I got out of the film is that, you have a grown 38-year old man with no life, and a little kid struggling to get through school and meet friends.  The message being, no matter what the age, your life is probably going to be stuck in a rut at *some* point.The humor came whenever Hugh Grant would lie as a way to try and impress the ladies.  One scene in particular was great the way he just made up the fact he had a younger son and when the truth was revealed, he just blew it off like it was no big deal.Overall, it's got comedy elements, and a messgae that displays honesty and maybe even familiarity too.

596423,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B00005JL7Q,Charity Bishop,"[1, 7]","Although a definite improvement over some of the studio's prior projects, About a Boy still has a cold, dead, and crude heart that believes the general public's desire is to love a womanizing deadbeat like this film's 'hero,' Will.Living life as simply and pleasurably as he can (which includes always looking 'hot,' and hitting up every single woman on the street for date and evening sex), Will has a real problem. He's shallow. He's not as much of a chick magnet as he used to be. And... he has a plan. Realizing that divorced women with kids are somewhat easier to manipulate, he decides to masquerade as a jilted husband and father with a made-up toddler, all in the prospect of finding new ground. He hooks up with a pretty young woman at the single parents' meetings, but their one date falls flat when she insists on bringing her best friend's kid Marcus along. The youngster is too smart for his own good, but sadly in need of a good influence. Unfortunately, Will isn't the right influence on his life and the film takes a hair-raising turn when they return home to find Marcus' mom unconscious from an attempted suicide.Marcus likes Will and attempts to set her up with his mom, whom Will befriends first superficially, but then more deeply when he realizes that she truly needs help. In a humorous twist, Marcus learns that Will is only pretending to be married and a father, and uses this against the 'would-be dad' to gain his own advantage. In the meantime, Will is beginning to fall for Rachel, a single mom in their group. Not as a future sexual prospect or a one-night stand. As a real person. The only problem is that she believes Marcus is Will's son... and he can't fess up. Although the film has a good heart and the selfish Will does improve with time, About a Boy is a rocky, often cynical and uncomfortable ride through what could more accurately be called About a GIRL. Perhaps the story isn't really about Will at all, but more accurately, about Marcus... and single mothers. Taking such an offensive standpoint as looking at divorced and single mothers as future sexual prospects doesn't do a great deal to endear Will to the average viewer. Some, like myself, will be downright offended. The film also flirts on the serious side with a manic-depressive mom who is suicidal. The only bright spot in the film is the kid. Marcus has a crush on a girl at school, and despite Will's interest in whether or not the kid wants to get physical, he merely replies that he just wants to talk with her. Nothing else is necessary. Surprised, Will waves it off... but later comes to the same conclusion about Rachel. The kid also pushes honesty in relationships and encourages Will to be truthful with himself.Will eventually sacrifices his own reputation for the greater good, but this won't be enough redeeming content to send many teens flocking to the theater. In fact, the good pales in the evidence of the bad... sexual content and profane language. Violent content is limited, although bullies torment Marcus at school. He also accidentally (but cruelly) kills a duck at the park by beaning it with a loaf of bread. Language is the next biggest problem, mounting in two f-words along with many British alternatives that mean the same thing; abuse of Jesus, Christ, and God's name is heavy, along with many minor profanities and crudities, including a running gag that involves a song with 'ass' in the title. The most alarming aspect of the hordes of disgusting language is that most pop out of Marcus' mouth. This Boy needs his mouth washed out with soap.Next comes the sexual content, which is used more in dialogue than anything else. Will is forever making sexually-oriented comments, both in mouth and mind. He looks at a porn site (implied), talks about his anatomy, and one of his girlfriends suggestively straddles and kisses him. The worst moment of the film that should make all of the women in the audience throw their popcorn at this lousy rat is when he's asked to stand as godfather for a little girl. Callously he says that wouldn't be a good idea, since when she eventually turns eighteen he will probably take her out, get her drunk, and possibly sleep with her. What good lessons they have are awash in disgusting content and sadly worldly views of love. About a Boy isn't really about a boy at all... it's more a vision of what our society has become. And it's a sad one.",3,Parental Review,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,4412,"['definite', 'improvement', 'studio', 'prior', 'projects', 'Boy', 'still', 'cold', 'dead', 'crude', 'heart', 'general', 'public', 'desire', 'love', 'womanizing', 'deadbeat', 'film', ""'hero"", 'Will.Living', 'life', 'simply', 'pleasurably', 'can', 'always', 'looking', 'hitting', 'up', 'single', 'woman', 'street', 'date', 'evening', 'sex', 'Will', 'real', 'problem', 'shallow', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'chick', 'magnet', 'used', 'be', 'plan', 'Realizing', 'divorced', 'women', 'kids', 'are', 'somewhat', 'easier', 'manipulate', 'masquerade', 'jilted', 'husband', 'father', 'made-up', 'toddler', 'prospect', 'finding', 'new', 'ground', 'up', 'pretty', 'young', 'woman', 'single', 'parents', 'meetings', 'one', 'date', 'flat', 'when', 'bringing', 'best', 'friend', 'kid', 'Marcus', 'along', 'youngster', 'too', 'smart', 'own', 'good', 'sadly', 'need', 'good', 'influence', 'Unfortunately', 'Will', ""n't"", 'right', 'influence', 'life', 'film', 'hair-raising', 'turn', 'when', 'return', 'home', 'find', 'Marcus', 'mom', 'unconscious', 'attempted', 'suicide.Marcus', 'likes', 'Will', 'attempts', 'set', 'up', 'mom', 'whom', 'Will', 'first', 'superficially', 'then', 'more', 'deeply', 'when', 'truly', 'help', 'humorous', 'twist', 'Marcus', 'Will', 'only', 'pretending', 'be', 'married', 'father', ""'would-be"", 'dad', 'gain', 'own', 'advantage', 'meantime', 'Will', 'beginning', 'fall', 'Rachel', 'single', 'mom', 'group', 'Not', 'future', 'sexual', 'prospect', 'one-night', 'stand', 'real', 'person', 'only', 'problem', 'Marcus', 'Will', 'son', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fess', 'up', 'film', 'good', 'heart', 'selfish', 'Will', 'improve', 'time', 'Boy', 'rocky', 'often', 'cynical', 'uncomfortable', 'ride', 'what', 'could', 'more', 'accurately', 'be', 'called', 'GIRL', 'Perhaps', 'story', ""n't"", 'really', 'about', 'Will', 'more', 'accurately', 'Marcus', 'single', 'mothers', 'Taking', 'such', 'offensive', 'standpoint', 'looking', 'divorced', 'single', 'mothers', 'future', 'sexual', 'prospects', ""n't"", 'do', 'great', 'deal', 'endear', 'Will', 'average', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'downright', 'offended', 'film', 'also', 'serious', 'side', 'manic-depressive', 'mom', 'who', 'suicidal', 'only', 'bright', 'spot', 'film', 'kid', 'Marcus', 'crush', 'girl', 'school', 'Will', 'interest', 'not', 'kid', 'get', 'physical', 'merely', 'just', 'talk', 'Nothing', 'else', 'necessary', 'Surprised', 'Will', 'off', 'later', 'same', 'conclusion', 'Rachel', 'kid', 'also', 'honesty', 'relationships', 'encourages', 'Will', 'be', 'truthful', 'himself.Will', 'eventually', 'own', 'reputation', 'greater', 'good', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'enough', 'redeeming', 'content', 'send', 'many', 'teens', 'flocking', 'theater', 'fact', 'good', 'pales', 'evidence', 'bad', 'sexual', 'content', 'profane', 'language', 'Violent', 'content', 'limited', 'bullies', 'torment', 'Marcus', 'school', 'also', 'accidentally', 'cruelly', 'duck', 'park', 'beaning', 'loaf', 'bread', 'Language', 'next', 'biggest', 'problem', 'mounting', 'two', 'f-words', 'many', 'British', 'alternatives', 'mean', 'same', 'thing', 'abuse', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'God', 'name', 'heavy', 'many', 'minor', 'profanities', 'crudities', 'including', 'running', 'gag', 'song', ""'ass"", 'title', 'most', 'alarming', 'aspect', 'hordes', 'disgusting', 'language', 'most', 'pop', 'Marcus', 'mouth', 'Boy', 'mouth', 'washed', 'out', 'soap.Next', 'sexual', 'content', 'used', 'more', 'dialogue', 'anything', 'else', 'Will', 'forever', 'making', 'sexually-oriented', 'comments', 'mouth', 'mind', 'porn', 'site', 'implied', 'anatomy', 'one', 'girlfriends', 'suggestively', 'straddles', 'worst', 'moment', 'film', 'should', 'make', 'women', 'audience', 'throw', 'popcorn', 'lousy', 'rat', 'when', 'asked', 'stand', 'godfather', 'little', 'girl', 'Callously', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'when', 'eventually', 'eighteen', 'will', 'probably', 'take', 'out', 'get', 'drunk', 'possibly', 'sleep', 'What', 'good', 'lessons', 'have', 'are', 'awash', 'disgusting', 'content', 'sadly', 'worldly', 'views', 'love', 'Boy', ""n't"", 'really', 'boy', 'more', 'vision', 'what', 'society', 'become', 'sad', 'one']",About a Boy

596426,A3IY28PW12MSVN,B00005JL7Q,Christine Wong,"[5, 5]","In the wonderfully entertaining ""About A Boy,"" Hugh Grant shucks everything that made him famous nearly a decade earlier in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (the floppy hair, the stuttering, etc.) and ends up giving his best performance to date. He plays Will, a wealthy, happily unemployed, commitment-phobic cad (slightly less insidious than Daniel Cleaver of ""Bridget Jones's Diary"") whose newest ploy is to date single mothers because they are easier to dump. However, he meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), the son of a somewhat suicidal mother (Toni Colette), and realizes that he cannot continue living his life so shallowly.This film was based on Nick Hornby's wonderful book of the same name and retains much of the wit and touching humor. The early scenes depicting Will's ""full,"" but spiritually empty, life are particularly amusing, with Will dividing the day up into units of time and spending these units on ""web-based research"" (finding pics of supermodels with see-through tops), ""exercise"" (shooting pool), grooming, and the like. Grant makes his character irresponsible, but remains enormously likable throughout the film. This is important because we start to identify with him, and understand his fears of commitment and helplessness behind his outward superficiality. His mannerisms-Grant's specialty, I think-are v. entertaining to watch; the selfishness, hurt, anger, recognition and more pass across his face effortlessly. The other cast members- Nicholas Hoult, Toni Colette, and Rachel Weisz - are also v. good in their supporting roles and play off each other well.The film doesn't follow the book too closely, however, but does one-up on the book by wisely emphasizing some parts that the book downplays. For example, Rachel (played by Rachel Weisz) only appears for a few pages in the book, but has much more presence in the movie. Through the Rachel character, we see how Will's relationship with her is different from his past shallow ones, and we realize that he is growing up. Also, the movie is filled with great one-liners and sharp, witty dialogue that never feels forced. The movie also employs voice-over function (Will's) very nicely; for example, in one serious scene, Will follows the ambulance to the hospital, looking rather serious, but in his voice-over he says. ""It was all terrible, just terrible. But driving fast behind the ambulance was fantastic."" The character would never say that out loud, but it provides comic relief and the assurance that he is, indeed, very shallow.The strength of ""About a Boy"" is in the simplicity and power of its scenes. Not one scene is wasted; each one tells us a wealth about the characters and leads to Will's self-discovery. That, along with Hugh Grant's delightful performance, and backed by a great score from Badly Drawn Boy, make ""About A Boy"" one of the most delightful, entertaining, and touching movies I've seen. It's a great feel-good movie. Highly recommended, especially to Hugh Grant fans, or anyone who has ever empathized or sympathized with Will and his situation.

Yes he is single again in this movie and yes he lives in London. And yes he is showing a ""darker"" side of himself as he did in ""Bridget Jones"" (which I loved).However, this movie is darker and deeper than his previous ""famous"" films (I have seen him in more serious fare from his younger days, but those films have been neglected by the mainstream.)""About a Boy"" recounts the relationship between a lonely, misfit adolescent male and an isolated bachelor. There is humor-most of it delivered by Grant. And there is poignancy-particularly in the performance of Toni Colette, who plays the boy's suicidal, hippie mother. All of the performances are wonderful-Grant, the young boy, Toni Colette, Rachel Weisz-and the cast plays off each other beautifully. In addition, the story resembles real life and not your formulaic romantic comedy-Grant meets and dates one woman, who leads him to the boy and his mother, who eventually lead him to another woman that he dates-instead of just your standard boy meets just one girl at the beginning of the movie and ends up with her by the closing credits.I would recommend this movie for fans of comedy and of romance, though this isn't a romantic comedy. I also would recommend this movie for lovers of Nick Hornby's work, the author on whose book the movie was based. Of course if you're a Hugh Grant fan, you'll love it.

After being set up with a single mom by a friend of his, he decides that this is a section of the dating pool that he was unaware of.  He begins to go to SPAT meetings (Single Parent Alone Together) and lies to make them think he is sensitive.  On his first date with a SPAT mom, she brings along the little of boy of a fellow SPATer named Marcus.  After a day of fun in the park, Marcus begins to think that Will would be perfect for his mother, an emotionally disturbed woman who attempts to tkae her own life.  He sets in motion a plan to get Will to marry his mother.  Marcus begins to spend more time with Will and eventually gets throught to him and makes him realize that he needs more out of life then himself.  ""As Jon Bon Jovi said, no man is an island"".

Things change for Will when he decides to join a single parents group all in serch of his next date (you'll see why single mothers are his prime choice).

He lives with his mother Fiona (Toni Collette) who is chronically depressed a bit suicidal.  Marcus, feeling that he's 'hit it off' with Will decides to make the first move and ask Will to spend time with him.  Throughout the process of the film we see that these two 'boys' need each other to become the 'men' they should be.  As Will realizes that he's finally caring about someone other than himself he has to fight to make sure he never loses it.

596436,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00005JL7Q,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[3, 3]","While there is a certain modicum of truth that Hugh Grant seems to play the same personality over and over, i.e. being the Cary Grant of this generation, in this particular movie, he shines out in what's possibly his best role to date since Four Weddings And A Funeral.  This isn't solely to his performance of being a self-sufficient selfish loner who can't relate to people who have jobs or families, but the way in which his onscreen narration describes his point-of-view, his philosophy, makes Will an interesting character:  &quot;Me, I didn't mean anything about anything to anyone, and I knew that guaranteed me a long, depression-free life.&quot;Will is proud to be an island, particularly the holiday resort Ibiza.  He describes his life as a TV show.  As head of the Will Show, which isn't an ensemble drama, &quot;people come and go, but it comes down to [him] alone.&quot;Will tries picking up women at a single parents support group, SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together), and falls for Suzie.  After his mother suffers a depressive spell, Marcus later realizes he needs a backup, and turns to Will, with whom he spends time with after school, thus drastically changing the format of the Will Show.  Without going into too much detail, something drastic happens to the star of the Will Show as well--he becomes more human, more connected, gains a soul, etc.The one good thing I'm noticing about certain movies is that they bring out the pains of being a kid who doesn't fit in, gets picked on, and tries to but due to external forces, can't.  In Marcus's case, his mother stands out as a &quot;granola basket case&quot; as Will describes her, she is vegetarian, and is unaware of the need for kids to fit into their peer group via pop culture.  Even his sudden singing out in class might've been &quot;cool&quot; among his peers if it had been something like the Mystikal CD Will gives him for Christmas.  Instead, he is jeered at for singing the Carpenters' &quot;Rainy Days And Mondays&quot; in class.Much of the other supporting actors really bring this movie to life, especially Nicholas Hoult as Marcus and Rachel Weisz as Rachel, a women Will falls for later on.  And Badly Drawn Boy's soft alternative sounds enhance this movie.  In the end, the point is regardless of the kind of life one leads, be it living off royalties, being a single parent, etc., it's whether one has the appropriate backup.  One doesn't have to join the mainland (mainstream) per se, but as a compromise, be part of an archipelago (distinct lifestyles).There's another subtle message that I might be reading too much into.  Will says he's proud he's an island, but it's a &quot;sad fact from time to time, I had to visit the mainland.&quot;  I wonder if this is a hidden punch at the UK's isolated geographic position as opposed to the continent, Europe, or even its position over the Euro.  And what about the title?  While About A Boy could well refer to Marcus, who becomes the catalyst in Will's life, it could also be about Will himself, who in his sense of being a blank, might as well be one as well.",5,Funny but sweet movie on how we all need back-up,1058572800,"07 19, 2003",2003,3101,"['certain', 'modicum', 'truth', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'play', 'same', 'personality', 'i.e', 'being', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'generation', 'particular', 'movie', 'out', 'what', 'possibly', 'best', 'role', 'date', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', ""n't"", 'solely', 'performance', 'being', 'self-sufficient', 'selfish', 'loner', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'jobs', 'families', 'way', 'onscreen', 'narration', 'point-of-view', 'philosophy', 'Will', 'interesting', 'character', 'quot', 'Me', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', 'anything', 'anyone', 'knew', 'guaranteed', 'long', 'depression-free', 'life.', 'quot', 'Will', 'proud', 'be', 'island', 'particularly', 'holiday', 'resort', 'Ibiza', 'life', 'TV', 'show', 'head', 'Will', 'Show', ""n't"", 'ensemble', 'drama', 'quot', 'people', 'come', 'go', 'down', '[', ']', 'alone.', 'quot', 'Will', 'picking', 'up', 'women', 'single', 'parents', 'support', 'group', 'SPAT', 'Single', 'Parents', 'Alone', 'Together', 'Suzie', 'mother', 'depressive', 'spell', 'Marcus', 'later', 'backup', 'Will', 'whom', 'time', 'school', 'thus', 'drastically', 'changing', 'format', 'Will', 'Show', 'going', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'something', 'drastic', 'happens', 'star', 'Will', 'Show', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'human', 'more', 'connected', 'gains', 'soul', 'etc.The', 'one', 'good', 'thing', ""'m"", 'noticing', 'certain', 'movies', 'bring', 'out', 'pains', 'being', 'kid', 'who', ""n't"", 'fit', 'picked', 'tries', 'due', 'external', 'forces', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Marcus', 'case', 'mother', 'out', 'quot', 'basket', 'case', 'quot', 'Will', 'vegetarian', 'unaware', 'need', 'kids', 'fit', 'peer', 'group', 'pop', 'culture', 'Even', 'sudden', 'singing', 'out', 'class', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'quot', 'cool', 'quot', 'peers', 'had', 'been', 'something', 'Mystikal', 'CD', 'Will', 'Christmas', 'Instead', 'jeered', 'singing', 'Carpenters', 'quot', 'Rainy', 'Days', 'Mondays', 'quot', 'class.Much', 'other', 'supporting', 'actors', 'really', 'bring', 'movie', 'life', 'especially', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'Marcus', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Rachel', 'women', 'Will', 'later', 'Badly', 'Drawn', 'Boy', 'soft', 'alternative', 'sounds', 'enhance', 'movie', 'end', 'point', 'regardless', 'kind', 'life', 'one', 'be', 'living', 'off', 'royalties', 'being', 'single', 'parent', 'etc.', 'one', 'appropriate', 'backup', 'One', ""n't"", 'have', 'join', 'mainland', 'mainstream', 'se', 'compromise', 'be', 'part', 'archipelago', 'distinct', 'lifestyles', 'subtle', 'message', 'might', 'be', 'reading', 'too', 'much', 'Will', 'island', 'quot', 'sad', 'fact', 'time', 'time', 'had', 'visit', 'mainland.', 'quot', 'wonder', 'hidden', 'punch', 'UK', 'isolated', 'geographic', 'position', 'opposed', 'continent', 'Europe', 'even', 'position', 'Euro', 'what', 'title', 'A', 'Boy', 'could', 'well', 'refer', 'Marcus', 'who', 'catalyst', 'Will', 'life', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'about', 'Will', 'who', 'sense', 'being', 'blank', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'as', 'well']",About a Boy

With the exception of perhaps ""Notting Hill"", he has always come off to me as being somewhat smug and self-satisfied.  In this film he portrays a thirtyish slacker who lives off an inheritance who is confronted with the reality of growing up.  This guise comes in the form of a maladjusted adolescent(Nicholas Houlte) who has to deal with bullies and his mother's suicidal tendencies.  Grant's character serves as a mentor for the lad and in the process matures himself.  The title of the film has something of a double-meaning.  Does it refer to the young boy or Grant's character?  The acting in this film is excellent with Houlte giving a natural performance and Toni Collette as his mother gives a complex reading of a character that could have been cliched.  The script here is excellent.  There are a number of scenes that stand-out.  One involves Grant volunteering for Amnesty International so he can meet girls on the phone bank.

596440,A35UNON2GI8C0R,B00005JL7Q,David Kusumoto,"[4, 8]","Not since 1996, when Hugh Grant donned a doctor's jacket and turned serious in ""Extreme Measures,"" has there ever been a picture that would allow me to accept this mannered British actor -- as being not much more than an OK leading man with floppy hair -- who would forever play the same character in one flimsy crowd-pleasing comedy after another.Until now.  ""About A Boy"" goes so much further to enhance Hugh Grant's career than even that ""villain"" he played in ""Bridget Jones Diary.""  Hands down, this is Grant's best career performance.  Though his high English accent is still present, he dumps his standard tics and stuttering, adding greater meaning to the phrase, ""irresponsible and intellectual louse.""Some elements in this picture seem to follow a formula, e.g., idiot fop remains an idiot, kid enters picture, so do a couple of women, idiot fop wakes up.  But there's more going on in this observational comedy-drama.  It feels authentic.Set entirely in Great Britain, Grant plays a guy who does absolutely nothing.  He lives off royalties from some horrific Christmas ditty everybody loves that was written by his father, who's dead.  No commitments, no shackles; he's a man who loves to juggle girls and lies.  He's not a stupid man, as is apparent by how he strings sentences in his narration.  He just doesn't give a damn.Without giving away how his transformation occurs, there is some true-to-the-heart revelations that are believable to anyone who has gone through 'em -- which means most of us -- albeit at a much earlier age than the character played by Hugh Grant (in this film, he's pushing 40).  That it comes to this guy so late makes his reactions all the more precious and rewarding.What I like most about this film is its rich characters in a dramatic script that draws fine humor from bad situations.  This humor, for the most part, doesn't stretch to push a joke that's out of place.  This keeps the tonality of the picture consistent and engrossing.  (Think of that restaurant scene in ""When Harry Met Sally"" and you know what I'm talking about when I say I have no tolerance for something that gets a big laugh but is stupidly ""out of place"" with a tone established 30 minutes before.)You think you've seen your share of ""bachelor"" stories?  Well here's one that allows you to smirk and laugh without feeling patronized or contempt by a endless string of cheap sit-com lines.Hugh Grant's ""Will"" displays the type of ""intellectual"" befuddlement that is believable by virtue of his knowledge of arts and history, but with complete ignorance about a life outside night clubs and his 21st century-equipped bachelor ""flat.""  He only cares, when we meet him, about pleasure, as expressed in elapsed periods of time he calls ""units.""  Beyond self-centered, he's still charming, given how brutally honest he can be about how awful he's perceived by the world.  When he handles a baby, it's just a ""thing"" to him.  An animal, a pet, would be more endearing to him.  But he's only selectively honest.  His pursuit of pleasure, his demand to live for ""the moment,"" requires ""lies"" to achieve success as he sees it.Then in walks this smart kid named ""Marcus,"" wonderfully played by Nicholas Hoult.  He carries the other half of the picture.  So expressive, wiser beyond his years, yet so used to be picked on, so eager to please his suicidal but loving hippie mother, played by the always fabulous Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, The Sixth Sense, The Hours).Of course there's a love interest, and it's not Toni Collette.  It turns out to be someone else.  While there are some goofy moments that could've been clipped here and there, on the whole, there are few false notes here.  All of the character actors play off each other well, and they raise Grant's performance to higher levels.  Finally, a Hugh Grant picture that makes best use of Hugh Grant; and the script is everything, based in part on the hit novel by Nick Hornby.I'm certain if this film had been released in the winter of 2002, Grant would be up for an Oscar and his film would be among the nominees for Best Picture.  It has a snappy visual style and tempo, as well as a soundtrack that is perfect.Some report mixed emotions with the end of the picture.  I think this has to do with wanting air-tight closure.  It's not quite there but I was still satisfied; in the end, because you've invested so much in these characters, because you haven't been bored for a second, because you haven't seen an endless barrage of cliches -- you don't want this story to end.  You want to keep going to see what happens, despite getting hint of a mild uplift in the last frame.  This is the best feeling to have.  Keep you wanting more.Finally, I love how ""About a Boy"" isn't just about the boy Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).  It's also about Will (Hugh Grant).  Will ""Will"" ever grow up?  Maybe, maybe not.

I make an exception when it becomes clear that the producers and/or director are deviating from the story not for artistic purposes or for purposes of condensing a work to fit into about 2 hours (give or take). This is one such exception. Almost every deviation from the book is a cheap attempt to dumb down the story and to pander to more contemporary audiences (the book is set in the mid-90s...which may as well be the dark ages, as far as these folks are concerned).This is the story of a young man who, after a series of foibles, ends up spending time with an adolescent boy and they both end up changing each others lives in unexpected ways.Marcus (the boy) is meant to be depicted as utterly clueless when it comes to contemporary pop culture and trends. In the book, Hornby uses Marcus's lack of awareness of Nirvana and Kurt Cobain as a key point to establish this fact. In the movie, the makers decided to update Kurt Cobain with some random hip-hip artist to change with the times. Ordinarily, this wouldn't be a big issue but for the fact that Cobain killed himself, sparked a general feeling of malaise and despair among his largely teenage audience, and then set into motion the events that build up to the conclusion of the story. When you take away Cobain, you need to rewrite the penultimate act of the story...and the writers of this film did...just not in a way that felt organic.The end result (of this and other changes) is that the story suffers, the depiction of Marcus suffers, and a great book turns into an enjoyable, but average, film.Bottom line: Decent and fun movie, Hugh Grant is well cast, but a pale imitation of the original story.",3,"Fair, although not great, adaptation of the book",1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,1766,"['usually', 'refrain', 'comparing', 'movies', 'and/or', 'television', 'shows', 'books', 'are', 'based', 'make', 'exception', 'when', 'clear', 'producers', 'and/or', 'director', 'are', 'deviating', 'story', 'not', 'artistic', 'purposes', 'purposes', 'condensing', 'work', 'fit', 'about', '2', 'hours', 'give', 'take', 'one', 'such', 'exception', 'deviation', 'book', 'cheap', 'attempt', 'dumb', 'down', 'story', 'pander', 'more', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'book', 'set', 'mid-90s', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'dark', 'ages', 'as', 'far', 'folks', 'are', 'concerned', '.This', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'series', 'foibles', 'up', 'spending', 'time', 'adolescent', 'boy', 'end', 'up', 'changing', 'others', 'unexpected', 'ways.Marcus', 'boy', 'meant', 'be', 'depicted', 'utterly', 'clueless', 'when', 'contemporary', 'pop', 'culture', 'trends', 'book', 'Hornby', 'Marcus', 'lack', 'awareness', 'Nirvana', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'key', 'point', 'establish', 'fact', 'movie', 'makers', 'decided', 'update', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'random', 'hip-hip', 'artist', 'change', 'times', 'Ordinarily', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'big', 'issue', 'fact', 'Cobain', 'killed', 'sparked', 'general', 'feeling', 'malaise', 'despair', 'largely', 'teenage', 'audience', 'then', 'set', 'motion', 'events', 'build', 'up', 'conclusion', 'story', 'When', 'take', 'away', 'Cobain', 'need', 'rewrite', 'penultimate', 'act', 'story', 'writers', 'film', 'did', 'just', 'not', 'way', 'felt', 'organic.The', 'end', 'result', 'other', 'changes', 'story', 'suffers', 'depiction', 'Marcus', 'suffers', 'great', 'book', 'enjoyable', 'average', 'film.Bottom', 'line', 'Decent', 'fun', 'movie', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'well', 'cast', 'pale', 'imitation', 'original', 'story']",About a Boy

Most importantly, they were also wise enough to preserve most of the original book's characteristically British flavor.You know the kind of vintage Hollywood cheesefest I'm talking about: one of those kitschy, brain-dead, focus-group-spawned, tear-jerking, cheesy-feel-good plotlines affirming ""family values"" and other assorted crockery with the painfully melodramatic UPLIFTING HAPPY ENDING you could see coming about ten miles away.Well, this movie comes close to the edge of that abyss but thankfully gets pulled back every time by a very potent antidote: British humor!  Otherwise known as sarcasm, irony, wit, and other terms seldom understood in this Bushian age of ""reality"" shows and semi-retarded presidents.  This film is full of that, with a very strong snappy script that could only have been written on that little island off the western coast of Europe...and no, I don't mean Ireland.There are sprinklings of cheese here and there but plenty of merciful restraint, so all the parts that had me cringing in anticipation of a full-frontal CHEESE ASSAULT actually turned out to fairly well, it was done in the most admirably tasteful moderation.The special features on this DVD are also noteworthy.  I've never seen a film with so many deleted scenes that made me wish they had NOT been deleted!  (With most films it's easy to see why the ""Deleted Scenes"" were deleted.)  There's also some music videos and artist info about the British pop band whose music dominates the pleasantly catchy pop soundtrack, and an ""English to English"" dictionary feature which I'm sure Americans who've never been exposed to British English idioms will find extremely useful.I'm not sure I could sit and watch this movie more than once, but it was nonetheless an VERY fun 2 hours!",4,(GASP!)

Yes, Grant plays a man who is primarily a layabout lout who pretends to have a son in order to score with the women at the local single parent's group.  On a parallel course, a boy with a suicidal mom (Toni Collete) seems drawn to Grant and their paths converge.  But Grant's character seems to exist outside the movie plot, and although in retrospect the plot may be somewhat predictable, I found that while watching the movie I was so engrossed in the arc of Grant's character I really didn't have any of those irritating stray thoughts that throw you out of the movie by telling you where it is going.

This time the Weitz Bros (of ""American Pie"" fame) are the chosen directors, and they manage to deliver an entertaining, honest and meaningful comedy that`s above many laugh-a-minute flicks out there.Like most Nick Hornby`s oeuvres, ""About a Boy"" presents a funny, intelligent story that deals with the subject of isolation, loneliness, personal growth and contact with those who surround us, approaching this themes in a simple, natural and engaging way.Will (played by a convincing Hugh Grant) is the typical late twenties slacker who lives in his own world and doesn`t bother much with what goes on beyond his reduced circle, living a shallow, selfish and uninteresting everyday routine. Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) is a smart though lonely kid that has no friends or motivations, and whose only companion is his single, neurotic and depressed mother (Toni Collette). As the movie develops, Will and Marcus become friends and forge a personal bond, providing some hilarious, clever moments and a couple of touching ones, too.This, like ""High Fidelity"", is a guy flick, since men are the ones who can find some situations here more relatable, though it still is a worthwile movie for everyone anyway. Personally, I could identify with both Marcus and Will, discovering parallels between my life and theirs.Despite its somewhat predictable plot, ""About a Boy"" is nonetheless a witty, poignant picture, with an intriguing storytelling and a couple of well-observed details about mundane life (Will`s cynical description of time passing through).

596461,A2NSDLHSG4YBHV,B00005JL7Q,Gwen A Orel,"[0, 0]","I rented this because I wanted something to make me smile, Pirates of the Caribbean was out, and a rerun of Sense and Sensibility made me remember how much I always enjoy Hugh Grant.  In short:  my expectations were low.  I'd read the book when it came out and very much enjoyed it, but expected a movie to take the premise and make it formulaic.That premise:  a likeable wastrel, a cad with no malice in him, a slacker with money, pretends to have a child so he can meet single mothers-- they are nurturing, sexy, and tend not to want long relationships.  A variety of circumstances forces him into a big-brother-type relationship with a nerdy 12-year old with a suicidal hippy mother.Now, the best thing about Nicholas' Hornby's boos isn't the situation-- it's the insight of the characters, the little thoughts they share that we all have.  Well, like the earlier film of a Hornby book, High Fidelity, this movie captures many of them by using voiceovers-- and it works perfectly!  How can you not like a character who while sincerely upset by having to go to the hospital following the hippy mother's suicide attempt, confides that driving fast behind the ambulance was brilliant?Is there a driver among us who wouldn't secretly think the same thing?  Sure, we wouldn't share it-- but that's what makes Will's character so likeable.  He's basically an honest person-- he only lies to get girls.  He is shallow, knows it, and is content.Or so he thinks.I also love that it's obvious that Will and the hippy mother will NOT miraculously hook up, that the nerdy boy transforms gradually-- no Pretty Woman-like miraculous makeover.  The pair of cool trainers (sneakers) Will buys for him is stolen by bullies!And yet, we do see the characters change.I found I just didn't want the movie to end.  It was charming, and smart.  Hugh Grant plays these smart, charming, mischievous characters so perfectly.  (He plays a similar purposeless-rich-fellow in Two Weeks Notice, which is also a charming movie, but more contrived than this one).  There is real pain and loneliness in the movie, but they are not at odds with the laughs and the heart.  Great ensemble acting all around.  Most of the comedy stems from character, and the characters are recognizable-- flawed, human, lovable.""No man is an island""-- was it said by John Donne?  Jon Bon Jovi?  Will wonders early on, watching ""Who wants to be a millionaire.""  His character enjoys being an island that occasionally has ties to the mainland-- he considers himself Ibiza (he pronounces it, hilariously, Ibetha, using a Castilian lisp).  Watching Will enjoy himself connecting to others is comic and yet also as satisfying as any AT&T; commercial without being half as maudlin.Just what the doctor ordered when you need a diversion that doesn't insult your intelligence; a real delight!",5,Just what the doctor ordered!,1072569600,"12 28, 2003",2003,2834,"['rented', 'wanted', 'something', 'make', 'smile', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'was', 'out', 'rerun', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'made', 'remember', 'how', 'much', 'always', 'enjoy', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'short', 'expectations', 'were', 'low', ""'d"", 'read', 'book', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'very', 'much', 'expected', 'movie', 'take', 'premise', 'make', 'premise', 'likeable', 'wastrel', 'cad', 'malice', 'slacker', 'money', 'have', 'child', 'can', 'meet', 'single', 'mothers', 'are', 'nurturing', 'sexy', 'tend', 'not', 'want', 'long', 'relationships', 'variety', 'circumstances', 'forces', 'big-brother-type', 'relationship', 'nerdy', '12-year', 'old', 'suicidal', 'hippy', 'mother.Now', 'best', 'thing', 'Nicholas', 'Hornby', 'boos', ""n't"", 'situation', 'insight', 'characters', 'little', 'thoughts', 'share', 'have', 'Well', 'earlier', 'film', 'Hornby', 'book', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'movie', 'many', 'using', 'voiceovers', 'perfectly', 'How', 'can', 'not', 'character', 'who', 'sincerely', 'upset', 'having', 'go', 'hospital', 'following', 'hippy', 'mother', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'driving', 'fast', 'ambulance', 'was', 'brilliant', 'there', 'driver', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'secretly', 'think', 'same', 'thing', 'Sure', 'would', ""n't"", 'share', 'what', 'Will', 'character', 'so', 'likeable', 'basically', 'honest', 'person', 'only', 'get', 'girls', 'shallow', 'content.Or', 'so', 'also', 'love', 'obvious', 'Will', 'hippy', 'mother', 'will', 'NOT', 'miraculously', 'hook', 'up', 'nerdy', 'boy', 'transforms', 'gradually', 'Pretty', 'Woman-like', 'miraculous', 'makeover', 'pair', 'cool', 'trainers', 'sneakers', 'Will', 'buys', 'stolen', 'bullies', 'yet', 'do', 'see', 'characters', 'change.I', 'found', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'movie', 'end', 'was', 'charming', 'smart', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'smart', 'charming', 'mischievous', 'characters', 'so', 'perfectly', 'similar', 'purposeless-rich-fellow', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', 'also', 'charming', 'movie', 'more', 'contrived', 'one', 'real', 'pain', 'loneliness', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'odds', 'laughs', 'heart', 'Great', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'around', 'Most', 'comedy', 'character', 'characters', 'are', 'recognizable', 'flawed', 'human', 'lovable', 'man', 'island', 'was', 'said', 'John', 'Donne', 'Jon', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'Will', 'early', 'watching', 'Who', 'be', 'millionaire', 'character', 'being', 'island', 'occasionally', 'ties', 'mainland', 'Ibiza', 'hilariously', 'Ibetha', 'using', 'Castilian', 'lisp', 'Watching', 'Will', 'enjoy', 'connecting', 'others', 'comic', 'yet', 'also', 'as', 'satisfying', 'AT', 'T', 'commercial', 'being', 'half', 'maudlin.Just', 'what', 'doctor', 'ordered', 'when', 'need', 'diversion', ""n't"", 'insult', 'intelligence', 'real', 'delight']",About a Boy

596463,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005JL7Q,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","ABOUT A BOY, based on Nick Hornby's 1998 hit novel, showcases a Hugh Grant veering away from his more normal role of hapless, stuttering romantic lead and, instead, this time, playing a shallow, emotionally stunted cad. Hugh Grant is so good in this role that it doesn't take long before you find yourself being charmed by this ingratiating, witty, and rudderless no-goodnik. Equally solid is the youngster Nicholas Hoult, who makes his film debut here. The not-quite-father-and-son (more like older-and-younger-brothers) rapport between Grant and Hoult, as well as a storyline which doesn't pander to the audience, makes this movie really work.SPOILERS here: This movie is about a boy...and a man who acts like a boy. Will Lightman (Hugh Grant) is a 38 year old bachelor whose songwriting father once wrote a famous Christmas jingle, of which royalties Will is still cheerfully living on. Will has never worked in his life and uses his credo ""all men are islands"" to explain the lonely emptiness and aimlessness in his life. He spends all his time ensuring that his life is so compartmentalized that he has activities broken down into units of time (taking a bath: 1 unit, exercising: 3 units, having his hair carefully dis-shelved: 4 units, etc.). He's so irresponsible that when a friend invites him to become her baby girl's godfather, the aghast Will rejects the offer. His friend retorts in disbelief, ""I thought you had hidden depths,"" to which Will responds with a clarifying ""No, no, no, no...no. You always had that wrong. I really am this shallow."" The other lead character is Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), an odd 12-year-old boy who's a misfit in school and who's constantly worried about his unstable mother (Toni Collette). Marcus is so off-the-wall that even his nerdy chums cast him off as being too weird.When Will turns his lasvicious eyes on single mothers, he discovers the SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) support group. He joins a session and actually bags a picnic date with single mom Susie. However, on the day which will forever be known as the Dead Duck Day (oh, that poor duck!), Will is horrified to find out that the picnic will have added company in the form of  Marcus, whom Susie takes care of on occasion. The rest of the film depicts the relationship between Marcus and Will as, in due course, Marcus teaches Will to become more responsible and caring, and Will, in return, gives Marcus self-confidence and helps him to fit in better with his peers as Will becomes the go-to adult anchor in the boy's life. In the end, Will discovers that, instead of being a mere island, a chain of islands is infinitely more satisfying.The story is great, obviously. Chris and Paul Weitz, who had earlier helmed AMERICAN PIE, would, at first, seem to be poor choices to be directing this higher brow effort, but, apparently, they were big fans of the book and managed to convince the right people. They do a massively good job here, conducting a delicate juggling act of comedy, pathos, and cynicism. The secret of this movie, of course, is that it contains a core of misery. The socially awkward Marcus is sadly unable to be a regular kid and is thus ridiculed by his peers. His mom is definitely ""off colored"" and is prone to fits of depression. And Will. The saddest thing may be that, for a great length of film time, he continues to endorse his solitary and meaningless way of life. When he does come around, finally, there's a feeling that he does it somewhat reluctantly. The bits of humor thrown into the mix perfectly balances out the picture and even works to bolster the pathos and make the cynicism seem less cruel.The cast is excellent. And a very well done to Hugh Grant, who has matured to the point where I feel he's become a real thespian, instead of this clever bloke with a cute blinking gimmick and nice hair. And, of course, I continue to savor his urbane, uniquely British wit. His predominant on-screen partner, newcomer Nicholas Hoult, plays off him really well and they have nice moments that are quirky without being too syrupy. The best thing about Nicholas is that he didn't play his Marcus as confused but sweet. There were actually moments where I thought the kid was being too pushy or obtuse. I could see why other kids would bully him - Marcus is more than a bit off-kiltered. Still, you do end up rooting for him to do well. Toni Collette, as usual, convincingly makes her presence felt as Marcus's troubled mom as there were points in the film where I thought, ""Uh-oh, she really is gonna off herself."" More screen time for the ravishing Rachel Weisz would've been preferred, but I do understand that this film is about Will and Marcus and not Will and Rachel, so it's all good.Special Features include: ""Spotlight on Location"": the 11-minute Making of ABOUT A BOY; feature commentary by Directors Chris and Paul Weitz; deleted scenes (with optional directors' commentary); music videos by Badly Drawn Boy (including the awesome ""Something to Talk About""; lyrics to ""Santa's Super Sleigh""; English to English dictionary; production notes; cast & crew bios; and the movie trailer.As someone in the special features mentioned, this film is an intelligent blend of cynicism and hope. Nick Hornby's depiction of bachelorhood in England is well represented here as the directors strived mightily to be faithful in their adaptation, though, apparently, they did come up with new stuff for the end bits. So, yes, do try this one out. ABOUT A BOY is thoughtful, a bit prickly, funny, and not at all mawkish,and, because the film doesn't insult the audience's intelligence, it'll stay in your brain and in your heart just that much longer.

596467,A24D0DENA8N7GH,B00005JL7Q,James Sadler,"[2, 2]","""About a Boy"" has a problem. Everyone thought it was a chick flick so men stayed away from it in droves. A modest hit in America, it suffered from the perception that it was yet another Hugh Grant movie whose target audience was women.But, this is a movie for and about guys. It is a movie that does a great job of examining the isolation so many men place themselves in and their relationships to the boys who will follow in their footsteps. Its proof that every boy needs a father in his life.Will (Hugh Grant) is a man who is living what a lot of us might see as a great life. Thanks to a hit Christmas single written by his father, a record Will happens to hate, Will does not have to work and lives the easygoing life of a bachelor in London. Although not quite rich, he is sufficiently comfortable with his income that he can own a great car, live in a nice apartment, and pretty much do as he pleases. He justifies both his existence and himself by openly admitting he is shallow, somewhat self-centered, and wants to stay that way. Because he is honest about himself he feels everyone should accept him as he is without criticizing him. Will believes that all men are islands and that they do not need strong relationships, so he constantly wanders from relationship-to-relationship with women, enjoying everything but having to break up with them when he tires of them.Will is introduced to a single mom and pretends to like her child in order to date her. In reality he believes he wants absolutely nothing to do with children. When she breaks up with him because she is not ready for a serious relationship, he believes he has hit upon a new dating tactic: date single mothers who apparently are so tied up in getting their lives in order that they will break up with him.In order to better pull off the [trick], he pretends to be a single father and joins a group called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together). On a date with single mom, he meets a young boy, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), who suffers with being an outcast at school and with having a depressed, sometimes-suicidal mom (Toni Collette), who Will at one point characterizes as ""a barking lunatic.""Marcus figures out Will's [trick], and sort of blackmails him into letting Marcus hang out at his apartment. Soon, unwillingly at first, Will finds himself trying to help Marcus blend in at school (after Marcus is harassed by other school kids, Will advises that Marcus make himself invisible) and advising him on dealing with girls and many of the problems a boy faces growing up.Will then actually falls for a single mom (Rachel Weisz) and finds that the only way he can gain her interest is to  pretend to be a father, recruiting Marcus to play the part of son. Unfortunately for Will, he is actually growing emotionally and finds himself, in a strange bout of honesty, admitting he is not a father causing him to return his ""island"" status. Only he now finds he's not too happy with being an island and that he truly feels a bond with Marcus.He attempts to save Marcus from potential social disaster at a school talent show, serving himself up to ridicule and deflecting all of the catcalls to himself and away from Marcus. Will eventually concludes that maybe he is not just an island, but part of an island chain.The movie is filled with clever humor and one-liners and Hugh Grant is perfectly suited for the role of Will. In fact, its hard to imagine anyone else in any of the roles in the film; it's perfectly cast. Yes it has a happy ending, but this is not a tear-inducing happy ending, its an ending that seems perfectly suited to those involved without becoming overly emotional or mauldin.The movie, and book it is based on, are really metaphors for the lives of men. It is a great examination of the isolation that men place on themselves. Marcus is heading down the same road as Will, a life cut off from any real relationships, and it is only in developing what amounts to a father-son relationship that both can find happiness and true growth as men.Trust me, guys, while women love this film, it most definitely is not a chick flick and should be required viewing for every man who feels alone in the world and afraid of relationships.",5,Vastly underrated and not a chick flick,1065744000,"10 10, 2003",2003,4220,"['Boy', 'problem', 'Everyone', 'thought', 'was', 'chick', 'flick', 'men', 'stayed', 'away', 'droves', 'modest', 'hit', 'America', 'suffered', 'perception', 'was', 'yet', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'movie', 'target', 'audience', 'was', 'women.But', 'movie', 'guys', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'examining', 'isolation', 'so', 'many', 'men', 'place', 'relationships', 'boys', 'who', 'will', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'proof', 'boy', 'father', 'life.Will', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'man', 'who', 'living', 'what', 'lot', 'might', 'see', 'great', 'life', 'Thanks', 'hit', 'Christmas', 'single', 'written', 'father', 'record', 'Will', 'hate', 'Will', 'not', 'have', 'work', 'easygoing', 'life', 'bachelor', 'London', 'not', 'quite', 'rich', 'sufficiently', 'comfortable', 'income', 'can', 'own', 'great', 'car', 'live', 'nice', 'apartment', 'pretty', 'much', 'do', 'existence', 'openly', 'admitting', 'shallow', 'somewhat', 'self-centered', 'stay', 'way', 'honest', 'everyone', 'should', 'accept', 'criticizing', 'Will', 'men', 'are', 'islands', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'strong', 'relationships', 'constantly', 'relationship-to-relationship', 'women', 'enjoying', 'everything', 'having', 'break', 'up', 'when', 'them.Will', 'introduced', 'single', 'mom', 'like', 'child', 'order', 'date', 'reality', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'children', 'When', 'up', 'not', 'ready', 'serious', 'relationship', 'hit', 'new', 'dating', 'tactic', 'date', 'single', 'mothers', 'who', 'apparently', 'are', 'so', 'tied', 'up', 'getting', 'lives', 'order', 'will', 'break', 'up', 'him.In', 'order', 'better', 'pull', 'off', '[', 'trick', ']', 'be', 'single', 'father', 'group', 'called', 'SPAT', 'Single', 'Parents', 'Alone', 'Together', 'date', 'single', 'mom', 'young', 'boy', 'Marcus', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'who', 'being', 'outcast', 'school', 'having', 'depressed', 'sometimes-suicidal', 'mom', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'who', 'Will', 'one', 'point', 'barking', 'lunatic', 'Marcus', 'out', 'Will', '[', 'trick', ']', 'sort', 'blackmails', 'letting', 'Marcus', 'hang', 'out', 'apartment', 'Soon', 'unwillingly', 'first', 'Will', 'trying', 'help', 'Marcus', 'blend', 'school', 'Marcus', 'harassed', 'other', 'school', 'kids', 'Will', 'Marcus', 'make', 'invisible', 'advising', 'dealing', 'girls', 'many', 'problems', 'boy', 'growing', 'up.Will', 'then', 'actually', 'single', 'mom', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'gain', 'interest', 'pretend', 'be', 'father', 'recruiting', 'Marcus', 'play', 'part', 'son', 'Unfortunately', 'Will', 'actually', 'growing', 'emotionally', 'strange', 'bout', 'honesty', 'admitting', 'not', 'father', 'causing', 'return', 'island', 'status', 'Only', 'now', 'not', 'too', 'happy', 'being', 'island', 'truly', 'bond', 'Marcus.He', 'attempts', 'save', 'Marcus', 'potential', 'social', 'disaster', 'school', 'talent', 'show', 'serving', 'ridicule', 'deflecting', 'catcalls', 'away', 'Marcus', 'Will', 'eventually', 'maybe', 'not', 'just', 'island', 'part', 'island', 'chain.The', 'movie', 'filled', 'clever', 'humor', 'one-liners', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'role', 'Will', 'fact', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'roles', 'film', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Yes', 'happy', 'ending', 'not', 'tear-inducing', 'happy', 'ending', 'ending', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'involved', 'becoming', 'overly', 'emotional', 'mauldin.The', 'movie', 'book', 'based', 'are', 'really', 'metaphors', 'lives', 'men', 'great', 'examination', 'isolation', 'men', 'place', 'Marcus', 'heading', 'down', 'same', 'road', 'Will', 'life', 'cut', 'off', 'real', 'relationships', 'only', 'developing', 'what', 'amounts', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'can', 'find', 'happiness', 'true', 'growth', 'men.Trust', 'guys', 'women', 'love', 'film', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'chick', 'flick', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'man', 'who', 'alone', 'world', 'afraid', 'relationships']",About a Boy

596469,A171FCUSCW4C8N,B00005JL7Q,"Janis Hendler ""filmfan""","[1, 1]","This is one of those rare instances when the product outshines expectations.  I purchased &#34;About a Boy&#34; out of deference to Nicholas Hoult (I believe this was his first major feature), who has grown into one of the most fascinating young actors in film today.  I expected a self-indulgent Hugh Grant too-cute film with Hoult as a bonbon, but instead watched an imaginative, charming and thought-provoking story of complex human emotions.Hoult is an extremely eccentric kid tormented by other children while struggling to cope with his single hippie mother's depression and attempted suicide.  The mother/son relationship is complex and atypical, breaking personal ground; she has no idea how her doting attention and unconscious efforts to make her son into a partner rather than a child affect him adversely.  Likewise, Grant's self-centered rich-boy-growing-old has a lot of room for improvement, which is ultimately stimulated by his unexpected, unwanted relationship with the awkward but doughty boy.The plot is simple:  A horny single dude realizes he can meet vulnerable women among self-help groups for single parents.  He signs up for meetings in which he is the only male, fabricates a non-existent child with all the phony emotional duress of an equally non-existent failed marriage, and wins the hearts of all around him.  He hones in on one attractive mother and while he initially scores with her, the son of the messed-up hippie mom hones in on him as a surrogate father to help him cope with his mother's disabilities.Grant's cold-hearted cad is not immediately melted by the irritating boy who insistently shows up at his door and insinuates himself into his home.  But as he realizes the torture the child endures, which may reflect the callowness he showed to others when he was young, he very gradually accepts responsibility for love.I recommend this movie on many levels, excellent acting being only one.  It's a feel-good movie that doesn't offer pat, simplistic resolutions, and ultimately is immensely touching (albeit occasionally cringe-worthy).",5,DEFINITELY WORTH OWNING,1395878400,"03 27, 2014",2014,2079,"['one', 'rare', 'instances', 'when', 'product', 'expectations', 'purchased', '34', 'Boy', '34', 'deference', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'believe', 'was', 'first', 'major', 'feature', 'who', 'grown', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'young', 'actors', 'film', 'today', 'expected', 'self-indulgent', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'too-cute', 'film', 'Hoult', 'bonbon', 'instead', 'watched', 'imaginative', 'charming', 'thought-provoking', 'story', 'complex', 'human', 'emotions.Hoult', 'extremely', 'eccentric', 'kid', 'tormented', 'other', 'children', 'struggling', 'cope', 'single', 'hippie', 'mother', 'depression', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'mother/son', 'relationship', 'complex', 'atypical', 'breaking', 'personal', 'ground', 'idea', 'how', 'doting', 'attention', 'unconscious', 'efforts', 'make', 'son', 'partner', 'rather', 'child', 'affect', 'adversely', 'Likewise', 'Grant', 'self-centered', 'rich-boy-growing-old', 'lot', 'room', 'improvement', 'ultimately', 'stimulated', 'unexpected', 'unwanted', 'relationship', 'awkward', 'boy.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'horny', 'single', 'dude', 'can', 'meet', 'vulnerable', 'women', 'self-help', 'groups', 'single', 'parents', 'signs', 'up', 'meetings', 'only', 'male', 'non-existent', 'child', 'phony', 'emotional', 'duress', 'equally', 'non-existent', 'failed', 'marriage', 'hearts', 'one', 'attractive', 'mother', 'initially', 'son', 'messed-up', 'hippie', 'mom', 'hones', 'surrogate', 'father', 'help', 'cope', 'mother', 'disabilities.Grant', 'cold-hearted', 'cad', 'not', 'immediately', 'melted', 'irritating', 'boy', 'who', 'insistently', 'up', 'door', 'home', 'torture', 'child', 'endures', 'may', 'reflect', 'callowness', 'showed', 'others', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'very', 'gradually', 'responsibility', 'love.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'many', 'levels', 'excellent', 'acting', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'feel-good', 'movie', ""n't"", 'offer', 'pat', 'simplistic', 'resolutions', 'ultimately', 'immensely', 'touching', 'occasionally', 'cringe-worthy']",About a Boy
596470,AX19A39YU2Y71,B00005JL7Q,"J. Cain ""fuzzlekins""","[4, 4]","This movie has been pegged as a romantic comedy, but it's actually more of a comedy/drama.  While there is romance, that does not come until later in the film and there's so much more to this film than that.  After seeing as much as I could stand of Bridget Jones' Diary, and hearing that the same writer wrote the story that this film was based on, I was skeptical even though Hugh Grant was in it.  I like Hugh Grant.  I think his comedic timing is fantastic, he rates very high on the charm scale, he's not bad to look at, and that accent is to die for.  HOWEVER, Bridget Jones' Diary appeared to be a mistake for Mr. Grant in my eyes.  Alas, curiosity won over, I couldn't resist, and I watched About A Boy anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised!  This movie was full of humor, intelligent humor as well as below the belt humor. Hugh was a pleasure to watch in this film that seemed to be tailored to him, for what we know of the real life Grant. Grant plays a shallow, womanizing, self-proclaimed forever bachelor who has no interest in children.  Enter a boy.  Enter a troubled boy from a troubled home who has a bit of social trouble at school. Grant, being nothing if not rich and suave, winds up helping this boy that he initially wanted nothing to do with.  Along the way, he does find romance and he finds himself -- a new and improved self.  He also manages to make a difference in the lives of the other lead characters.  All in all, this one is definitely worth a watch if not an own.

596474,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JL7Q,Joe Sherry,"[1, 1]","A film by Chris and Paul WeitzAbout a Boy is based on the Nick Hornby novel of the same name.  In this movie we meet Will (Hugh Grant).  Will is a single man who lives by himself and has never held a job in his life.  See, Will's father wrote a popular Christmas song and Will is able to live off of the royalties.  He may hate the song, but it allows him to live the life in the manner that he sees fit, which is just as self-centered as you can imagine it would be.  Will is in his late 30's and he went to a single parent's group meeting in the hopes to meet a single parent (he has found they make great temporary girlfriends).  He has to fake having a child to do this and ends up dating one for a little while.  In a round-about way this lets Will meet Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), the young son of Fiona (Toni Collette).  It is better seen than explained how Will and Marcus become friends/associates, but this relationship is central to the entire movie because it affects how Will approaches Rachel (Rachel Weisz), a woman he is very attracted to, and it affects his entire life.This was a very realistic feeling film and I can't say that there was a real weakness in it.  The heart of the movie is the relationship between Will and Marcus and throughout the movie we can see a transformation of who Will is and who Will is becoming (and wants to become).I'll be honest, I've never thought much of Hugh Grant as an actor, but I thought that he did a fantastic job in the movie.

As a result, the book DOES find itself to be rather dated the further we get from Cobain's death...but that event, so central to the teen angst of the period, made the teen characters seem more legitimately troubled in a way that the movie, perhaps more timeless as a result of parting ways with the book re: the Cobain angle, simply cannot adequately grasp.Hugh Grant is fantastic in the role of a flawed male lead character that Hornby specializes in writing about, and his interaction with the other characters is alternately well-played and extremely uncomfortable to watch; his performance does make this movie worth a watch, but you would get far more out of the experience by reading the book.  &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, this ain't.",3,Should have been a lot better.,1069632000,"11 24, 2003",2003,1564,"['oldest', 'dismissal', 'line', 'filmed', 'adaptaions', 'books', 'be', 'books', 'well-written', 'otherwise', 'quot', 'book', 'was', 'better', 'quot', 'case', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'confirmed', 'pop', 'culture', 'Arsenal', 'Football', 'Club', 'addict', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'quot', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'quot', 'viewer', 'should', 'be', 'advised', 'going', 'quot', 'A', 'Boy', 'quot', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'to.And', 'just', ""n't"", 'up', 'task', 'book', 'was', 'well-written', 'as', 'involving', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Characters', 'were', 'developed', 'sufficient', 'depth', 'very', 'title', 'book', 'play', 'Nirvana', 'song', 'quot', 'A', 'Girl', 'quot', 'plot', 'taps', 'conscience', 'quot', 'generation', 'X', 'quot', 'bringing', 'early', ""'90"", 'icon/martyr', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'story', 'indirectly', 'yet', 'importantly', 'making', 'central', 'point-of-reference', 'result', 'book', 'DOES', 'find', 'be', 'rather', 'dated', 'further', 'get', 'Cobain', 'death', 'event', 'so', 'central', 'teen', 'angst', 'period', 'made', 'teen', 'characters', 'seem', 'more', 'legitimately', 'troubled', 'way', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'more', 'timeless', 'result', 'parting', 'ways', 'book', 're', 'Cobain', 'angle', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'adequately', 'grasp.Hugh', 'Grant', 'fantastic', 'role', 'flawed', 'male', 'lead', 'character', 'Hornby', 'writing', 'interaction', 'other', 'characters', 'alternately', 'well-played', 'extremely', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'performance', 'make', 'movie', 'watch', 'would', 'get', 'far', 'more', 'experience', 'reading', 'book', 'quot', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'quot', 'ai', ""n't""]",About a Boy

Living on an inheritance, Grant doesn't much care for anything but spending money and being a bum.

Having read the titular book by Nick Hornsby, I was a little afraid to watch the movie in fear that it would go against the book. I was a little surprised that it stayed faithful to the book throughout the entire movie. Albeit it is a movie adaptation so some things were changed, but nothing to make me regret the film.Hugh Grant is Will, an actual good-for-nothing who lives off the fame of his father's famed Christmas song which he despises. During a scheme to pick up single mom's, he becomes involved in the life of 12 year old social outcast, Marcus played by Nicholas Hoult. The Weitz bros., the directors, took Hornsby's novel and made it perfectly viewable. The transition between scenes has a great pace and the playout of the evolving fatherlike relationship Will begins to have over Marcus is shown with heart. Hugh Grant handles the part of Will with charm. He showed a great performance. Nicholas Hoult as Marcus was a great choice for the role. I hope the kid has much more opportunities in his future; however they'll probably be British productions. Toni Collette (Very quirky in an off way in this film) and the beautiful Rachel Weisz also costar.The DVD is a hefty one. Picture and audio transfers are great. The supplemental material is satisfying. Especially neat is the ""English to English"" which is a featurette on British slang.About A Boy succeeded to be touching and enjoyable as both a book and a movie.

596496,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B00005JL7Q,L.A. Scene,"[3, 5]","Hugh Grant seems to have perfected the role of playing the spoiled young Rich person.  In many of his films, this is the role he has been cast into - and he has done a brilliant job at perfecting his character in each of these roles.  I've become a big fan of Hugh Grant's - not because of the characters he plays, but because he probably has become the top actor in his profession when it comes to Romantic Comedy films.  I was particularly excited about the film ""About a Boy"".  In addition to having the spoiled rich man in a Romantic Comedy, Grant was going to be able to demonstrate his talents opposite a young boy.  While this film did entertain me, I probably wouldn't put this film at the top of Grant's portfolio of film work he has done.This film is basically divided into two parts.  In the first part of film, we see Grant as Will - a rich single bachelor who doesn't need to work and who enjoys the singles scene.  Will is content with his life.  Will gets the idea of pursuing ""single moms"", however Will intends fully to continue to ""play the field"" without getting bogged down into any commitment.  He even invents an imaginary son to help in his pursuit of single moms.  While dating a single mom, Will meets nerdy 12-year-old Marcus Brewer.  Marcus is the son of a friend of this particular single mom.  It seems that Marcus' mother Fiona is suffering from serious depression problems - and even tries to commit suicide.  Fiona's suicide attempt is unsuccessful, and following that - Marcus decides that Will would be the perfect companion for his mother.  Although Marcus' attempts at setting Will and his mother fail, Marcus soon develops a liking for Will as friend.  Thus, the first part of the film, we see a bond between to form between Will and Marcus.In the second part of the film, things begin to change.  Will begins to pursue a woman named Rachel (played by Rachel Weitz), who also has a young son.  For the first time, Will begins to see things differently.  He begins to realize how shallow his life has been to this point, and that he may want to do more than just play the field.  Now it's Will who must enlist Marcus' help to win over Rachel.  Meanwhile Marcus is still having problems - coping with his mother's depression and trying to win over a girl he likes.  When things go sour with Will and Rachel, it's Marcus who calls on Will for help.  But Will is having self-doubts, and is not sure he can be there for Marcus.There are some good and bad things about this film.  For starters, Hugh Grant delivers another stellar performance.  While in movies such as ""Nine Months"", we've seen Grant able to pull of the physical comedy, this movie focuses more on Grant's dry sense of humor - and this comes off brilliantly.  One terrific scene is at the end of the movie when Grant comes on stage with Marcus and sings a duet of ""Killing Me Softly"".  It's a scene that you wouldn't expect from Hugh Grant, yet it comes off brilliantly.  One thing that is interesting is that the film is narrated from two perspectives.  The first perspective comes from Will.  Will narrates the story from his point of view and as he narrates it we see a transformation of the self-centered rich person who plays the field to the person wanting more out of life and being a responsible person others can rely on.  The second perspective comes from Marcus.  Marcus will narrate things and we see how he transforms from a nerdy kid lacking self-confidence, to a person who has gained self-confidence thanks to his friendship with Will.  Finally, I liked the fact that the movie was filmed in England.  I've always felt that Grant has been very strong when he is on his ""home turf"" - in such movies as ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" and ""Notting Hill"", he has blended into the London scene perfectly.As for the bad things.  I did not care for Nicholas Hoult's portrayal of Marcus.  I did not find Marcus the boy who would ""warm our hearts"" and be a scene-stealer.  In fact, I think it was almost delibrate that he wasn't a scene-stealer.  I found Hoult's portrayal as Marcus as one that would make the Marcus character unlikable - even though you feel sorry for him that he is dealing with a mother who suffers from depression.  There is a scene in the movie that leaves you hanging - it is when Will is in a liquor store and he has a memory of his father in the liquor store.  I know a point was trying to be made here about Will's background and character - but to me this scene should have either been removed or expanded on.  Instead, I found myself asking more questions.Finally, I did not like how the movie came to a conclusion.  I thought the setting of the school Rock concert was pretty weak - even though this was the setting for the scene where Will sings ""Killing Me Softly"".  But to me - there had to be a better, more emotional setting for a conclusion to this movie.  We've seen great conclusions in such films as ""Notting Hill"" and ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", but this film seems to drop the ball.  I did like the ""epilogue"" to the movie - when we see how everything turns out.Overall, I still did enjoy the movie.  If you are a Hugh Grant, this will keep you happy.  However, you probably will realize that this isn't like some of the other ""Home Run"" films (""Nine Months"", ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", ""Love, Actually"")  that Hugh Grant has been a part of.  It's still a movie worth checking out.",3,"Another great Grant Performance, but not the strongest story",1119139200,"06 19, 2005",2005,5411,"['Hugh', 'Grant', 'have', 'perfected', 'role', 'playing',

596497,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JL7Q,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","Will (Hugh Grant) is a charming cad who does not have to do anything but watch television and date pretty women because he has the good fortune of living off the royalties for a catch little Christmas ditty called ""Santa's Super Sleigh,"" written by his father many years ago (Elvis recorded it).  In Will's philosophy, ""a person's life is like a TV show,"" and as far as our hero is concerned he is the star of ""The Will Show,"" which is not, he points out, ""an ensemble drama.""  To those familiar with standard movie plots and attuned to the nuances of script writing, we know that by the end of ""About a Boy"" we will see Will eat those words.It is become more difficult for Will to keep find women to date, since any and all such relationships have a life expectancy of two months tops.  So he hits upon the idea of dating single mothers because he stumbled upon the great ""truth"" that they are less demanding (i.e., more grateful) and easier to break up with (i.e., they care about their kids more than themselves).  The problem is that in searching for a place where one can increase the statistical probability of finding single women Will comes across a meeting of SPAT (Single Parents, Alone Together).  The only male at the meeting Will cheerfully spins a yard about being abandoned by his wife and having a remarkable 2-year old son named ""Ned.""  This bait hooks Suzie, the first of what Will thinks will be many fish in a sea of plenty.However, because these single parents make a point of helping each other out (the ""alone together"" idea) Will comes into contact with young Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), whose single mother, Fiona (Toni Collette), is not handling her new life all that well.  Circumstances force Will and Marcus together, and, not surprisingly, the young boy thinks that this would be the person to pull his mother out of her depression and make them a family.What makes ""About a Boy"" and above average film is that while such an end point might be what the story has set up and what convention would insist should come to pass, that is not what happens in the end here.  In fact, the ending is much more satisfying than that predictable conclusion.  The main thing is that whereas ""Ned"" is a great help to a preying bachelor, having the real article hanging around your apartment is not at all helpful.  Of course, eventually all this contact with the boy engenders real feelings in Will and when he meets Rachel (Rachel Weisz), he is confronted by a woman who is too good for him.  Does having a real ""fake"" son work better than having just a car seat littered with cracker crumbs?Ultimately the chief attraction of this film is watching the two main characters transform themselves into the possibilities of better people.  Marcus has an advantage because he is more mature, yet it is when we get a sense of honesty from Will, either when talking to himself or to another person, that we know we did not make a mistake in wanting the character to find happiness.  My taste in Hugh Grant films lends itself towards the ""Notting Hill"" and ""Sense & Sensibility"" direction than ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" or ""Two Weeks Notice,"" but ""About a Boy"" ends up at least in the middle adn is therefore quite acceptable.  Hard to believe this 2002 film was directed by the same guy(s) who did ""American Pie,"" which reminds me that the biggest laugh on the DVD is probably in the deleted scenes where we learn who else besides Elvis recorded ""Santa's Super Sleigh.""",4,"""The Will Show"" becomes an ensemble drama",1054252800,"05 30, 2003",2003,3468,"['Will', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'charming', 'cad', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'do', 'anything', 'watch', 'television', 'date', 'pretty', 'women', 'good', 'fortune', 'living', 'off', 'royalties', 'catch', 'little', 'Christmas', 'ditty', 'called', 'Santa', 'Super', 'Sleigh', 'written', 'father', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Elvis', 'recorded', 'Will', 'philosophy', 'person', 'life', 'TV', 'show', 'as', 'far', 'hero', 'concerned', 'star', 'Will', 'Show', 'not', 'out', 'ensemble', 'drama', 'familiar', 'standard', 'movie', 'plots', 'attuned', 'nuances', 'script', 'writing', 'know', 'end', 'Boy', 'will', 'see', 'Will', 'eat', 'words.It', 'become', 'more', 'difficult', 'Will', 'keep', 'find', 'women', 'date', 'such', 'relationships', 'have', 'life', 'expectancy', 'two', 'months', 'tops', 'idea', 'dating', 'single', 'mothers', 'stumbled', 'great', 'truth', 'are', 'less', 'demanding', 'i.e.', 'more', 'grateful', 'easier', 'break', 'up', 'i.e.', 'care', 'kids', 'more', 'problem', 'searching', 'place', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'increase', 'statistical', 'probability', 'finding', 'single', 'women', 'Will', 'meeting', 'SPAT', 'Single', 'Parents', 'Alone', 'Together', 'only', 'male', 'meeting', 'Will', 'cheerfully', 'yard', 'being', 'abandoned', 'wife', 'having', 'remarkable', '2-year', 'old', 'son', 'named', 'Ned', 'bait', 'Suzie', 'first', 'what', 'Will', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'fish', 'sea', 'plenty.However', 'single', 'parents', 'make', 'point', 'helping', 'other', 'alone', 'together', 'idea', 'Will', 'contact', 'young', 'Marcus', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'single', 'mother', 'Fiona', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'not', 'handling', 'new', 'life', 'well', 'Circumstances', 'force', 'Will', 'Marcus', 'together', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'young', 'boy', 'would', 'be', 'person', 'pull', 'mother', 'depression', 'make', 'family.What', 'Boy', 'above', 'average', 'film', 'end', 'point', 'might', 'be', 'what', 'story', 'set', 'up', 'what', 'convention', 'would', 'insist', 'should', 'come', 'pass', 'not', 'what', 'end', 'here', 'fact', 'ending', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'predictable', 'conclusion', 'main', 'thing', 'Ned', 'great', 'help', 'preying', 'bachelor', 'having', 'real', 'article', 'hanging', 'apartment', 'not', 'helpful', 'course', 'eventually', 'contact', 'boy', 'engenders', 'real', 'feelings', 'Will', 'when', 'Rachel', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'confronted', 'woman', 'who', 'too', 'good', 'having', 'real', 'fake', 'son', 'work', 'better', 'having', 'just', 'car', 'seat', 'littered', 'cracker', 'crumbs', 'Ultimately', 'chief', 'attraction', 'film', 'watching', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'transform', 'possibilities', 'better', 'people', 'Marcus', 'advantage', 'more', 'mature', 'when', 'get', 'sense', 'honesty', 'Will', 'either', 'when', 'talking', 'person', 'know', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'mistake', 'wanting', 'character', 'find', 'happiness', 'taste', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'films', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'direction', 'Mickey', 'Blue', 'Eyes', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', 'Boy', 'up', 'least', 'middle', 'adn', 'therefore', 'quite', 'acceptable', 'Hard', 'believe', '2002', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'American', 'Pie', 'biggest', 'laugh', 'DVD', 'probably', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'where', 'learn', 'who', 'else', 'Elvis', 'recorded', 'Santa', 'Super', 'Sleigh']",About a Boy

Attempting to meet single mothers (although he hates kids, he thinks single mothers are desparate) he accidentally falls in with a boy named Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).  Slowly the two begin a friendship that will be the most important relationship either has ever had.I don't want to say much more than that.  This story is endlessly charming.  American Pie directors Paul and Chris Weitz have fashioned a magnificent film out of Nick Hornby's material.  And how well does Hugh Grant fill out this role?  Charming, witty, and hopelessly self-absorbed, he is fantastic as Will, the guy you know you shouldn't like, but do anyway.All the supporting players are great too.

The gist of the movie is given elsewhere in these pages so I won't bore with a repetition but Rachel Weisz only gets around 15 minutes of screen time and Toni Colletes nutty mother early on is removed as a romantic interest.The real relationship here is all between Grant and Hoult with Hoult providing the driving force. His loping walk, strong stare and stunningly innocent smile are played to perfection and demonstrate both his need to find his place in the world and to drag his mother along with him.

I have to say that this is one of the best even though it is a departure from his usual fare of romantic comedies.  All the same, we have another stellar performance.  Will Freeman is a shallow, self-absorbed man who is independently wealthy.  This affords him a life that is completely boring (although he doesn't know it yet)--one that he fills with 30 minute segments--watching game shows, buying records, getting his hair cut, etc.  He has discovered a new way to date women though--single mothers are the best because there are no strings attached.  This is fine with Will as he is not emotionally attached to anyone.......until Marcus.Marcus is the twelve year-old son of a chronically depressed suicidal hippie.  He is emotionally exhausted from trying to keep his mother happy (and alive) and finds a safe haven at Will's house.  For a while there is no talking, no sharing, just peace.  Eventually Will finds himself liking this misfit and tries to protect him from the school bullies.  Once our hero opens himself up to the possibility of caring for someone, other friendships and even love will follow.Besides being laugh out loud funny, this adorable film has all the elements that make it a great movie.

596507,A3J510E9W1CJ1K,B00005JL7Q,mashby,"[5, 5]","I first saw this movie while on a business trip to Chattanooga. I needed to finish up some work on a presentation I was making the next day and there was nothing on TV, so I decided to splurge and rent an On-Demand movie. Most of the movies I had either seen, or had no interest in seeing and just as I was about to turn it off, I came across About A Boy. I hadn't heard much buzz about the movie and I'm not a fan of Hugh Grant, but for reasons unknown to me, I rented it.I was expecting another one of Hugh Grant's saccharine romantic comedies where he plays a charming befuddling fop as he's done ad nauseam since Four Weddings And A Funereal. Granted, I liked Four Weddings immensely, but by Notting Hill I'd had my fill. Much to my surprise, Grant was playing a completely different character and was clearly attempting to break his mold. He'd done that once before in Bridget Jones' Diary, where he played a jerk, but now he was taking it in another direction entirely. It's a refreshing and more importantly interesting change.But this movie isn't all about Hugh Grant's character Will. His co-star is new comer Nicholas Hoult, who plays the boy Marcus and he carries his own. Ultimately, the movie is about both of them, and so Hoult has the responsibility of carrying half the weight of the movie and he does a splendid job. Rounding out the cast is Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz, each do an excellent job as well. Suffice to say that the casting for this movie is brilliant. Each character is fully developed and rich with complexity and emotion. I bought each and every one of them. Not once did I feel that there was a weak link in the bunch. That's also surprising because this type of movie is hard to pull off.So what kind of movie is this? At it's heart, this movie is a comedy. That being said, with subject matter such as suicide, it is most definitely a drama as well. That's a fine line to walk in a film but Weitz Brothers deftly manage to pull it off. Granted their movie is based on the Hornby book by the same name, so they had a rich palette to begin with, but the brothers clearly rose to the challenge and created a fantastic movie. There have been plenty of good books that have been butchered at the box office and Boy is a rare exception. There's no cliche' choices made by the characters and the director's did a great job at staying true to the tone of the book. Chris and Paul also stretched themselves with their camera work and it pays off. If you're into ""film"" there's a lot to chew on between the use of jump cuts, depth of focus and swing shots. None of this gets in the way of the movie. If anything these camera techniques add to the performances and help tell the story.Interweaving it's way throughout the movie and in some cases almost playing a role in the film, is the music and it is spot on. All the music was written by Badly Drawn Boy specifically for this movie. I was not familiar with the artist prior to seeing the film, but the director's couldn't have made a better choice. Although each song stands on it's own on the soundtrack, each song also easily blends into the scene and lends a hand in creating just the right tone for the movie. After listening to the soundtrack, I could imagine it as simply a regular artist release, so it stands on it's own. Yet when it's worked into the movie it's pure gold.So why do I like it so much? I'd like to think that I'm not alone in this, but it's because I can relate to the movie on so many levels. There are so many scenes that I could describe, but in the end I would be retelling the entire movie. Every scene has something in it that is worth watching again and again. I can relate to Marcus as he's picked on in school, tries to cope with his mother's depression and ultimately knowingly faces complete and utter embarrassment as a last ditch effort to make his mother happy. The names and places have been changed to protect the innocent, but I've been there. Then there's Will who has to finally face his demons and his father's legacy in order to join the human race and be a part of other peoples lives. Although not an exact context, I've been there in one way shape or form.Surprisingly, I caught myself watching it again the other day on DVD and it struck me that this movie is now in my Top 10, or dare I say Top 5 movie list. I maybe be borrowing from another fantastic Hornby book/movie High Fidelity, but it's true. It's not Citizen Kane, but it is one of the best movies that takes a funny look at becoming a man through two different people. In trying to describe this movies to others, I've called it ""A guy's romantic comedy."" That doesn't really nail it on the head, but I'd like to think that About A Boy, IS a guy's movie. The subject matter may not have Rambo's, or Rocky's, but any guy who can think about something other than sports, or monster trucks should get something from this movie. It's Hugh Grant's best work to date. It's based on a hugely successful book and it's funny as hell.

596508,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JL7Q,Matthew Horner,"[0, 1]","""About a Boy"" is a great romantic comedy based on Nick Hornby's best-selling novel. [I haven't read it.] It's not an ordinary entry in its genre because of its points of view [those of an eleven year old boy who's old for his years and a thirty-eight year old man who's never grown up] and its refusal to follow the normal boy-gets-girl formula. The story could easily have veered into the maudlin and sentimental, but directing brothers Chris and Paul Wiesz [""American Pie""] inject wit and often acerbic humor at just the right moments.Will [Hugh Grant] lives off the royalties from a hit song his decesased father wrote. He keeps telling himself that the axiom `No man is an island' is no longer true in our world filled with technological marvels. He uses his money to live well and his good looks to get women. One day he discovers the world of single mothers and decides to invent a child of his own in order to charm these women. The plan works well enough at first, but when he meets a lonely boy [Nicholas Hoult] and his depressed mom [Toni Colette], he finds himself in a situation where, for the first time in his life, someone else's happiness might be more important than his own.Hugh Grant is an acting treasure. The movies today are filled with plenty of tough guys and rough guys, sweet ones and soft ones. Grant is one of the few actors around who are charming, funny and sophisticated in a loveable bad boy way. This may be his best performance to date - other contenders include ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"".

596509,APOUYO1BEPK22,B00005JL7Q,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[1, 1]","Will (Hugh Grant) is a single man always on the hunt for the next girl. His longest relationship he's really ever been in is 2 months. And that's ok for him. It's exactly how he wants it. Because to him, every man is an Island. One day, one of his dates tells him she has a 3 year old kid, and of course Will is horrified with this, but he goes on with it anyways. Will then finds out she's really into sex, so then Will decides to start dating single moms. But he has no clue how to find them until one day he comes across a flyer for single parents get together. So he decides to make up a child and then go to this meeting. He of course meets a lady there and they go on a date in the park, but Will's `son is visiting his mom right now' so he couldn't bring him along. But she brings her kid and also her friend's kid, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).Marcus is the total opposite of Will. He's a little nerdy and weird. Can't dress `popular' and really just doesn't fit in. Even the nerds at school don't want to hang with him. And honestly, Marcus really doesn't care, because he is who he is. Marcus's mother is a nut job, but she does love him, even though she really doesn't know him like she thinks she does. So after the date, Will and his date, take Marcus home to find an upsetting event that effect Marcus pretty deeply. The only way to cope with what's happened is to talk to Will, because Marcus thinks they are friends now because Will said `See ya later', which Marcus take to heart.Together, they both begin to learn from one another. This part is pretty is pretty clich&eacute;, but it really works because the two are both really likeable. I laughed quite a lot through the whole movie. Hugh Grant is just hilarious and the character of Marcus is just so innocent and loving that you can't help but either say `awww' or kinda laugh at the things that happen to him. He just ignores it mostly and never fights back. I don't know... writing it down just seems kind of upsetting, but you just have to see it I guess. Because kids are really just cruel as most of us know. The dialogue in the movie is great also. I love how Hugh Grant is just straight forward, which is kind of how I am like. He just tells it like it is, because honestly, how will someone really know and understand if you beat around the bush. The scene where he's arguing with Marcus's mom in the restaurant felt, to me, so good because I was thinking exactly the same thing. And another great thing about this moment is the narration from Will and Marcus. It was done really well and was sometimes very funny or very insightful. That was a great touch to me.In the end, I would say own this movie. I've seen it a lot and I still laugh a lot at it. It is a really funny and nice movie. Definitely one of those `feel good' movies.P.S. - God I love accents. Them European accents are so captivating to me.

Characters with depth, with really glaring innate flaws (hamartia), pivotal situations, critical connections, human emotion and transformation.Hugh Grant is type-cast in romatic comedies as fantasy-prince characters. Here, he is another 'light' character, but not boyish, not too good to be true. In fact, he's an unapologetic shallow exploiter of the kind of heart. But there is a GREAT (both large and good) transformation into a real adult human being. And he's not the only character who makes an important and 'good' transformation, growing out of their self delusions, changing from the charicatures that they want to be, to the adults that they must be, through helping others. OK, the message is a little predicable and mushy: no man is an island. But it's delivered in a really funny, realistic and interesting way.Other wonderful aspects of this movie:1. It shows the very British practice of being excessively polite. Study this movie to learn how to be REALLY polite, and kind.2. It displays wonderfully snide, appropriate, funny and acute comments.

It's about 3 people who are in a bind, stuck in isolation, not really knowing how to deal with it or how to change it---plus they are surrounded by folks that either don't see them, or are well meaning, but cannot connect with them to help them.  The three people are Will (Grant), Marcus the boy, and his mother, Fiona (Collette).Will technically should be in Nirvana, he is wealthy, doesn't work, is attractive enough to nail a different gal every night, yet really isn't doing much with his life--no passions like travel, golf, friends, etc.  His idea of Christmas is watching videos and getting drunk at home, alone.  His domineering Stephord-Wife sister & dope husband constantly has humiliating ""interventions"" with him, even in public, trying to fix his ""loser-ness"".  They want him to live just like they do, with the house, baby and spoiled uncontrolleable-animal toddler that hits folks in the sack, goo on the upholstery--not appealing.For all that he feels ""OK"", he keeps searching for the next woman---as opposed to hiring an escort service which would be more logical for what he claims to ""want"" in a woman.  He's even started an elaborate scheme to meet single mothers, thinking  low-risk target.  (Still not an escort service, so I think he does hope ultimately for connection.)  He is very aware that his lifestyle is a turnoff to most women who have interests & passions.  He never keeps anybody around long enough to get close and risk more pain.  Basically, he's not really living what could be a really cool life.Fiona is a new-age hippy vegetarian music-therapist, and is raising her boy, Marcus, that way.  For all her career and success at living the completely hippy, vegetarian lifestyle, you would think she would be in bliss too, but she too is desperately sad and alone, without many friends.  She is very controlling over her boy, and he has no way to rebel against her controlling, politically-correct dominations.Marcus, who has only his mother's viewpoints, none of his own in the beginning, is a very nerdy, granola boy.  His mother screeches ""I love you's"" at his school playground, making him giant Bulleye.  He's completely dressed the opposite of all the other kids, plus he retreats from reality quite often, going into fantasyland and singing at the worst times.  He's watching his mother slide down the depression slope, and after her attempt at suicide, he decides to bring in extra help--unsuspecting Will.Will accidentally met Marcus while trying to score on one single mother.  Marcus sized him up and decided he was a good material for helping his mother.  Unfortunately, Will wasn't interested.  But, Marcus craves friendship, since he had none, and his mother is a basketcase.  So, the adventure begins with Marcus pursuing the unwilling Will.  You can see though, that Will is growing to really depend on the human contact.I do think they are about the same age, although not sure what age that is.  The boy has been parenting his mother, watching her depression progress, trying to fix it.  Will runs away from any human emotions...  (Although Will finds babies and toddlers unappealing, I don't at all think this point makes him immature.  That idea comes from ""obsessed-with-children""-types that bully you to worship their demon-children, or get labeled awful things.)Anyway, you see the change these folks bring about in each other.

His father wrote a famous Christmas song and he has been living off the royalties all his life.  He thinks of everything in terms of 30 minute intervals.  Everyone in his life tells him he is wasting his life and it has no substance.He is looking for relationships that fit into his lifestyle - no strings short term.  So he decides to date single moms.  The problem is how to meet them.  His first idea is to attend a single parents mixer.  This creates its own problem because he doesn't have a kid.  So he creates a 2 year old but he doesn't have any idea how a two year old acts or what a two year old can do.  This blows up in his face.One day a boy shows up on his doorstep, Marcus (newcomer Nicholas Hoult) - (it's a little more complicated than that).  And he hires him to pretend to be his son.  He meets a beautiful single mom, Rachael (Rachael Wiess).  But things get complicated when Marcus has ideas of his own.  He wants Wil as his dad and tries to set him up with his offbeat mom (Toni Collette).The real story is not Wil trying to find a temporary mate but that of Wil and Marcus.  Wil is the real child, a man who has never had to grow up, and Marcus the child adult, a boy forced to grow up too fast.  These are the wonderfully touching and truly inspirational scenes.Of course, the Wil and Rachael story has to blow up and does.  The movie has a touching and almost over the top ending but it works.This is the typical Hugh Grant character but he has found a way to make it interesting and new.  Toni Collette continues to amaze me.  She can do anything.  And Nicholas Hoult is perfect, let's see if he can keep it up.DVD EXTRAS:Spotlight on Location: Making of About a Boy - A typical promo featurette running 11 minutes with book author Nick Hornby, directors Chris & Peter Weitz, actors Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Rachael Weiss and Toni Collette.

596522,A3RBEP5G0NBCV7,B00005JL7Q,M. Stark,"[8, 8]","First and foremost, I want to state that Hugh Grant, as an actor and screen presence, deserves to be respected more. The abuse this guy has endured, at the hands of the media and general public has been unwarranted and cumulative to the point where one of this generations most under-appreciated talents is considering an early retirement at age 43.The root of Grant's success and criticism is his championing of the romantic comedy. Once a well respected genre (think It Happened One Night - which swept all major Oscar awards in 1934, or The Philadelphia Story) the ""romcom"" is only now re-emerging as a force to be reckoned with. This is in part due to the success of a few classics such as When Harry Met Sally('84), Pretty Woman('90), Sleepless in Seattle('93), Groundhog Day('93), but more in part to the work of Hugh Grant.The man has almost single-handedly restored the genre to its rightful place as audiences are beginning to appreciate the depth, quality and cathartic power that movies like About a Boy are achieving. But his success has come at a price. Grant is in a unique predicament (not unlike most pop star idols) of being lionized by romcom audiences(mostly female) and lambasted by the media and the average Joe six-pack for being too soft, feminine, foppish, (pick your own).This is the reason he is deliberately seeking out roles with more weight and ""steel"". Not only is this a step in the right direction for the continued health and success of Grant, but also the logical evolution of the romantic comedy with the drama. Grant's character in About, who is a flawed and 3-dimensional with the pain, wounds and vulnerability that humans possess, represents this shift. We watch as he must break his cocoon of complacency or break down and die under its weight. The risks are really quite high; a life is at stake. And we watch this man break his shackles and gain a life of happiness, social connection and ultimately, love.The story is timeless one of personal transformation and freedom from mental barriers that we as vulnerable creatures erect to cope with the pressures and anxieties of modern living. About a Boy remembers that at the heart of every good story is a character flawed in some capacity that must engage in battle with his own personal demons before balance and harmony are attained. Through Grant's (character) transformation, we as witnesses to his story, must embrace his struggle as our own - this is the power of movies - thereby challenging ourselves to grow and improve.",5,A contemporary classic...,1089331200,"07 9, 2004",2004,2520,"['First', 'foremost', 'want', 'state', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'actor', 'screen', 'presence', 'be', 'respected', 'more', 'abuse', 'guy', 'endured', 'hands', 'media', 'general', 'public', 'been', 'unwarranted', 'cumulative', 'point', 'where', 'one', 'generations', 'most', 'under-appreciated', 'talents', 'considering', 'early', 'retirement', 'age', '43.The', 'root', 'Grant', 'success', 'criticism', 'championing', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'well', 'respected', 'genre', 'think', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'swept', 'major', 'Oscar', 'awards', '1934', 'Philadelphia', 'Story', 'romcom', 'only', 'now', 're-emerging', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'part', 'due', 'success', 'few', 'classics', 'such', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'more', 'part', 'work', 'Hugh', 'Grant.The', 'man', 'almost', 'single-handedly', 'restored', 'genre', 'rightful', 'place', 'audiences', 'are', 'beginning', 'appreciate', 'depth', 'quality', 'cathartic', 'power', 'movies', 'Boy', 'are', 'achieving', 'success', 'come', 'price', 'Grant', 'unique', 'predicament', 'not', 'most', 'pop', 'star', 'idols', 'being', 'lionized', 'romcom', 'audiences', 'mostly', 'female', 'lambasted', 'media', 'average', 'Joe', 'six-pack', 'being', 'too', 'soft', 'feminine', 'foppish', 'pick', 'own', '.This', 'reason', 'deliberately', 'seeking', 'out', 'roles', 'more', 'weight', 'steel', 'Not', 'only', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'continued', 'health', 'success', 'Grant', 'also', 'logical', 'evolution', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'drama', 'Grant', 'character', 'About', 'who', 'flawed', '3-dimensional', 'pain', 'wounds', 'vulnerability', 'possess', 'shift', 'watch', 'must', 'break', 'cocoon', 'complacency', 'break', 'down', 'die', 'weight', 'risks', 'are', 'really', 'quite', 'high', 'life', 'stake', 'watch', 'man', 'break', 'shackles', 'gain', 'life', 'happiness', 'social', 'connection', 'ultimately', 'love.The', 'story', 'timeless', 'one', 'personal', 'transformation', 'freedom', 'mental', 'barriers', 'vulnerable', 'creatures', 'erect', 'cope', 'pressures', 'anxieties', 'modern', 'living', 'Boy', 'remembers', 'heart', 'good', 'story', 'character', 'flawed', 'capacity', 'must', 'engage', 'battle', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'balance', 'harmony', 'are', 'attained', 'Grant', 'character', 'transformation', 'as', 'witnesses', 'story', 'must', 'embrace', 'struggle', 'own', 'power', 'movies', 'thereby', 'challenging', 'grow', 'improve']",About a Boy

About a Boy is a fantastic story paralleling the lives of a grown man (Hugh Grant) and a young boy.Now, being no Hugh Grant fan, I thought his presence in the film would be a great distraction all the way through, even if the story was good. But Grant manages to become his character, a listless man living off the royalties of his father's one hit wonder. I forgot the actor and was tricked into seeing the character, and the results opened my eyes to a fantastic film.What really makes this film work (aside from Grant's performance) is how it parallels the lives of Grant and the young boy, who keeps coming by his apartment uninvited looking for a father figure. Cutting from one shot of the boy doing or thinking (in voice over) one thing to Grant doing or thinking the same thing works splendidly. There are plenty of laughs, as well as feel-good moments in the film, without ever getting melodramatic or cheesy. It treads that fine line meticulously, and comes out a clear winner in the end.The music is well placed amongst the visuals of the film. Instead of taking current pop hits picked for their popularity, the songs have a direct correlation to the plot and situations, combining music and visuals in perfect harmony. The supporting cast, including Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense) is equally fantastic.The film is a complete joy from beginning to end.

Hugh Grant, Toni Collett and Nicholas Hoult are each obscenely talented in their own right and posess a spot-on grasp of their characters. Hoult's portrayal of the awkward and introspective Marcus is particularly sharp: a shy and authentic misfit whose only real human connection is with his emotionally unbalanced mother. That is of course until he meets Will (Hugh Grant) an emotionally unavailable thirty something that has no time in his life for the troubles of a young boy.  Grant's character is an entertaining cross between the devilishly sly character he played in Bridget Jones and the adorable geek he played in Notting Hill.What's wonderfully rare about this film is that it's touching without being the least bit overdone or precious. Through dealing with issues brought up by Marcus' mothers attempted suicide and Grant's relationship with his deceased father and issues of emotional isolation the film holds on to its sense of humor and charm. 'About a Boy' never tries to be what its not and as a result turns out to be a paradoxically heartbreaking and hilarious film that you'll want to watch over and over.Badly Drawn Boy's terrific soundtrack and the direction of Paul and Chris Weitz (perhaps most famous for the `American Pie' Trilogy) are also part of the film's strong points.",5,Perfect,1050537600,"04 17, 2003",2003,1370,"['success', 'unquestionably', 'charming', 'film', 'casting', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Toni', 'Collett', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'are', 'obscenely', 'talented', 'own', 'right', 'posess', 'spot-on', 'grasp', 'characters', 'Hoult', 'portrayal', 'awkward', 'introspective', 'Marcus', 'particularly', 'sharp', 'shy', 'authentic', 'misfit', 'only', 'real', 'human', 'connection', 'emotionally', 'unbalanced', 'mother', 'course', 'Will', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'emotionally', 'unavailable', 'thirty', 'something', 'time', 'life', 'troubles', 'young', 'boy', 'Grant', 'character', 'entertaining', 'cross', 'devilishly', 'sly', 'character', 'played', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'adorable', 'geek', 'played', 'Notting', 'Hill.What', 'wonderfully', 'rare', 'film', 'touching', 'being', 'least', 'bit', 'overdone', 'precious', 'dealing', 'issues', 'brought', 'up', 'Marcus', 'mothers', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'Grant', 'relationship', 'deceased', 'father', 'issues', 'emotional', 'isolation', 'film', 'sense', 'humor', 'charm', 'Boy', 'never', 'tries', 'be', 'what', 'not', 'result', 'out', 'be', 'paradoxically', 'heartbreaking', 'hilarious', 'film', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'over.Badly', 'Drawn', 'Boy', 'terrific', 'soundtrack', 'direction', 'Paul', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'perhaps', 'most', 'famous', 'American', 'Pie', 'Trilogy', 'are', 'also', 'part', 'film', 'strong', 'points']",About a Boy

Now, it's not that he's not excellent, because he is, but there are so many other excellent, multi-faceted performances in here, and they really are deserving of as much attention as Grant.The plot follows that of Grant as Will, a single man whose ineptitude at relationships has left him very alone at the age of 38. Upon realising that single mothers are an untapped source of women and one-night stands, he invents himself a child and joins the group SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together). Here he meets Susie, who introduces him to Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) and his hippie, depressive mother Fiona (Toni Collette). From here, Will and Marcus form an unlikely attachment as the man teaches the boy about trendy living, and the boy teaches the man about human relationships.Although the screenplay does interfere quite a bit with the story laid down in Nick Hornby's excellent original novel (of the same name, and well worth a read), this becomes immaterial in the face of powerhouse performances from the three leads. Grant as Will is very convincing as the emotionally-frozen man who starts to thaw slowly. He's wry and detached, and his trademark Brit-Flop method of acting is wisely reigned in here. He's very, very good as Will. Nicholas Hoult as Marcus is truly excellent, a highly gifted child actor playing a part which is essentially adult in attitude and depth, and he does a supreme job with the character of the slightly indie, left-field Marcus. And Toni Collette is simply stunning as the hapless Fiona, a hippie-mom whose passion for individuality leads to her son's ostracisation and her own depression. She is tender, believable and heartwarming, and generates huge amounts of sympathy for her character.Direction is really very, very good, with some interesting arial shots and gorgeous camerawork used by the brothers Weitz to illustrate various states of emotional turmoil experienced by the three protagonists. This creativity and professionalism, as well as the general all-round feeling of warm detatchment created by the film, is a far greater testament to the Weitz Boys' talent than any of the abysmal 'American Pie' trilogy.All in all, this is a really wonderful movie. Warming, thought-provoking and refreshingly different, it's a triumph of acting and a hugely welcome change from the Hollywood Brigade.Highly recommended.",4,"Hugely entertaining, touching and warm",1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,2440,"['Why', 'people', 'keep', 'banging', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'performance', 'A', 'Boy', 'Now', 'not', 'not', 'excellent', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'excellent', 'multi-faceted', 'performances', 'here', 'really', 'are', 'deserving', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'Grant.The', 'plot', 'Grant', 'Will', 'single', 'man', 'ineptitude', 'relationships', 'left', 'very', 'alone', 'age', '38', 'realising', 'single', 'mothers', 'are', 'untapped', 'source', 'women', 'one-night', 'stands', 'child', 'group', 'SPAT', 'Single', 'Parents', 'Alone', 'Together', 'Here', 'Susie', 'who', 'Marcus', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'hippie', 'depressive', 'mother', 'Fiona', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'here', 'Will', 'Marcus', 'form', 'unlikely', 'attachment', 'man', 'boy', 'trendy', 'living', 'boy', 'man', 'human', 'screenplay', 'interfere', 'quite', 'bit', 'story', 'laid', 'down', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'excellent', 'original', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'well', 'read', 'immaterial', 'face', 'powerhouse', 'performances', 'three', 'leads', 'Grant', 'Will', 'very', 'convincing', 'emotionally-frozen', 'man', 'who', 'thaw', 'slowly', 'wry', 'detached', 'trademark', 'Brit-Flop', 'method', 'acting', 'wisely', 'reigned', 'here', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'Will', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'Marcus', 'truly', 'excellent', 'highly', 'gifted', 'child', 'actor', 'playing', 'part', 'essentially', 'adult', 'attitude', 'depth', 'supreme', 'job', 'character', 'slightly', 'indie', 'left-field', 'Marcus', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'simply', 'stunning', 'hapless', 'Fiona', 'hippie-mom', 'passion', 'individuality', 'son', 'ostracisation', 'own', 'depression', 'tender', 'believable', 'heartwarming', 'huge', 'amounts', 'sympathy', 'character.Direction', 'really', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'interesting', 'arial', 'shots', 'gorgeous', 'camerawork', 'used', 'brothers', 'Weitz', 'illustrate', 'various', 'states', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'experienced', 'three', 'protagonists', 'creativity', 'professionalism', 'as', 'well', 'general', 'all-round', 'feeling', 'warm', 'detatchment', 'created', 'film', 'far', 'greater', 'testament', 'Weitz', 'Boys', 'talent', 'abysmal', ""'American"", 'Pie', 'trilogy.All', 'really', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Warming', 'thought-provoking', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'triumph', 'acting', 'hugely', 'welcome', 'change', 'Hollywood', 'Brigade.Highly', 'recommended']",About a Boy
596543,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JL7Q,RMurray847,"[5, 6]","Hugh Grant is one of my favorite film performers.  Notice I don't say ""actor.""  He doesn't really act, per se, since he's always riffing on basically the same character...usually with varying degrees of charming, slightly goofy befuddlement (NOTTING HILL, 9 MONTHS) or charm barely concealing nastiness (BRIDGET JONES).  In a film such as EXTREME MEASURES, where he played a doctor turned amateur sleuth, he just wasn't convincing.So much of his success lies with his ability to pick roles tailor made for him, such as in 4 WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.  He's an intelligent leading man with impeccable comedic delivery.  When the material written for him is good, he is GREAT.  When it's mediocre, he's only OK to watch.ABOUT A BOY is the best script he's had to date (well, maybe 4 WEDDINGS is...hard to say).  He plays a rich, single lout who lives only to indulge himself and score with women.  He truly only thinks of his own pleasures...most of which are remarkably humdrum.  He's not a creep or pervert or hedonist, really, he's just monumentally self-indulgent.  He didn't even earn his fortune, he inherited it.One day, he gets the bright idea of meeting women by joining a single-parent's support group.  He'll just pretend to be a single father, and all the single women who will greatly outnumber him will fall all over themselves over him.  AND HE'S RIGHT!!!But this is just where the movie gets started. Through a series of events involving trying to keep his secret just that, he ends up being stuck with a teenaged boy who is awkward and fatherless and extremely nerdy who also takes a liking for Grant and starts showing up at his apartment door every afternoon to watch TV.  Grant can't get rid of him...it's a kind of mild blackmail situation.  But slowly, slowly, slowly, the two begin to bond.  Grant, through sheer annoyance, begins to bully the kid into being less of a schlep.  And this tiny kernel of interest in another human being slowly begins to gnaw away at Grant's insular world.  He's upset by the changes he sees in himself, but he also becomes enchanted with the unique feeling of actually making an impression on others.The movie is very funny and has lots of near farcical situations.  The laughs are never cheap, though, and most of the humor is character driven.  It's not an action packed film, but I laughed outloud at LOTS of it...Grant's delivery has never been better.  But it was also moving, but in a very non-Hollywood, tear-jerking way.  The viewer is nearly as startled as Grant's character to see that we've grown to really care about the main characters.This is a terrific, moving comedy.  Every character is fully realized, even if only on screen for a scene or two.  It's beautifully filmed in London and there's not one moment where you feel you're watching an American movie.  It feels British through and through  (how weird for a film directed and produced by the brothers who brought us AMERICAN PIE...another movie that had surprising touches of drama that actually worked).

Nothing except spend money, bed women, lives in a fabulous apartment, and drives a very nice car.  He's living on the royalties of his fathers novelty song, ""Santa's Sleigh"".  He loathes the song, by the way, because it's sappy and he's heard it a million times (or more).Will, for some reason, starts to have a hard time finding willing women he can have an affair with, and then get rid of them by having them dump him.  His latest fling is a beautiful woman who has a child. After she dumps him (conveniently), Will decides to attend a 'SPAT' (Single Parents Alone Together), because he thinks he's hit a gold mine.  Women who are lonely, sexually hungry, and have a great excuse to dump him after a short while.  So he makes up a two year-old named Ned.Well, he does end up with a boy, Marcus, who is 12 and is having problems fitting in at school, where hardly anyone wants to hang with him, since his mom walks him to school, and he has a strange habit of just singing out loud without knowing it.  Marcus has a sad-sack mom, Fiona who seems on the verge of suicide every time we see her.  Marcus decides that Will might be a good guy to hang around with; Will isn't too sure.Recommended.

Well, certainly variations on the same character at the very least.  Yet there's nothing wrong with that.  After all John Wayne became an icon doing the same thing.  Whatever the case may be, Grant's performance in ""About a Boy"" is a keeper, and so is the film which is one of the best of 2002.Grant plays Will, a 38-year-old playboy determined to remain single and childless.  All is good in his world: he has a nice place, a nice car, a generous cash flow, and one fly-by-night relationship after another.  His ideal existence is rudely shattered when a young boy named Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) latches onto Will and comes to regard him as a fill-in father, mentor, and best friend all rolled into one.  Will tries to separate himself from Marcus as best he can but can't shake him off.  As time passes, Will finally admits to himself that he has developed feelings for the boy and goes about proving this by performing with him at a school assembly.  What results is a moment that is genuinely touching and hilarious at the same time.  You'll never be able to listen to the song ""Killing Me Softly"" the same way ever again.Hoult gives a great child-actor performance and is supported by strong supporting turns by Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz.  But ""About A Boy"" is Hugh Grant's triumph.  His perfectly-placed nuances and double-takes reveal him to be the king of romantic comedies for this generation.  2002 had its share of high-profile great movies like ""Minority Report,"" ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"" and ""Catch Me If You Can.""

596559,A2HW4GC6H0L2LR,B00005JL7Q,"T. George ""anne-with-an-e""","[3, 3]","When my friend suggested we go see this movie, I thought I was getting dragged to some chick flick.  I was reluctant, but she wasn't in town long and so I went.When I came out from watching to movie, I was stunned silent.  So was she.  And generally we both love analyzing books & movies to death.  All either of us could say was, ""That was one of the best movies I've ever seen.""  And we understood each other's silence and rested in the comfort that the other had been just as stunned.Does that sound too dramatic?  I'm sorry if it does.  I was, after all, expecting complete romantic rubbish.  And I don't hate Hugh Grant by any stretch of the imagination, but his characters aren't really inspiring.  If you feel that way, though, you should watch this movie.  You really catch a different side of him.  He plays an intelligent, witty, self-absorbed bachelor...which, apparently, is much closer to who Hugh Grant is as a person.  No insult is intended...but, from what I read, Grant appears to a loner, an introvert, a perfectionist, and - well - a bachelor ever since some unfortunate events in his life.OK, that all said, I should move onto the movie's plot.  Basically, you have this incredibly selfish bachelor (Grant) whose character is immediately engaging because he is incredibly aware of & honest about being selfish.  I found his character to be a complete breath of fresh air after being surrounded by so many people pretending to be something else.  He was honest...and he was even sincere if you could look his armor of self-indulgent behaviors.Then you have this boy Marcus.  (Yes, it's about a real 12 year old boy.  It's not a romance about some guy.)  And this boy is incredibly intelligent for his age.  Incredibly!  But he's also completely lost in his own world - which you can understand when you meet his mother...and, later, his father.  His clothes are enough to get him beat up without his singing in class & getting walked to school by his mom.But, don't worry, it's not as predictable as Grant getting together with Marcus's mom.  That would make it a romance.  Instead, you have a very quirky set of events to bring this man and this boy together.  Some of the events are some of the funniest scenes I'd seen in a long time.  However, some of the other scenes are an unglamorized look at the struggles most people are going through.And, I must mention that I absolutely LOVE the wake-up call given to the hippy, earth-loving culture.  I somewhat border on this culture b/c I love trees & earth & loose clothing & all things natural.  However, sometimes it goes too far and this movie calls it like it is...which I never thought would happen in a liberal industry like film.  I thought a film would be trashed immediately if it questioned such lifestyles.  But this script is so intelligent & realistic that you can't help but agree.Ultimately, I think it's this interlacing of witty genius, sincere characters, bold commentary and realistic emotion that makes this movie a masterpiece.  You never can relax and dismiss it as a comedy.  But you can never settle & dismiss it as a drama.  It's this incredibly poignant mix of antics, relationships - functional & disfunctional, sincere characters with flaw, and vivid realism that draws me in to this movie every time I watch it.  I have yet to get tired of this movie & I love sharing the joy of it with others.",5,No Man Is An Island...Or Is He?,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,3392,"['When', 'friend', 'suggested', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'getting', 'dragged', 'chick', 'flick', 'was', 'reluctant', 'was', ""n't"", 'town', 'long', 'so', 'went.When', 'came', 'out', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'stunned', 'silent', 'was', 'generally', 'love', 'analyzing', 'books', 'movies', 'death', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'understood', 'other', 'silence', 'rested', 'comfort', 'other', 'had', 'been', 'just', 'stunned.Does', 'sound', 'too', 'dramatic', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'was', 'expecting', 'complete', 'romantic', 'rubbish', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'inspiring', 'feel', 'way', 'though', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'really', 'catch', 'different', 'side', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'self-absorbed', 'bachelor', 'apparently', 'much', 'closer', 'who', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'person', 'insult', 'intended', 'what', 'read', 'Grant', 'loner', 'introvert', 'perfectionist', 'well', 'bachelor', 'ever', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'life.OK', 'said', 'should', 'move', 'movie', 'plot', 'Basically', 'have', 'incredibly', 'selfish', 'bachelor', 'Grant', 'character', 'immediately', 'engaging', 'incredibly', 'aware', 'honest', 'being', 'selfish', 'found', 'character', 'be', 'complete', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'being', 'surrounded', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'pretending', 'be', 'something', 'else', 'was', 'honest', 'was', 'even', 'sincere', 'could', 'look', 'armor', 'self-indulgent', 'behaviors.Then', 'have', 'boy', 'Marcus', 'Yes', 'real', '12', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'not', 'romance', 'guy', 'boy', 'incredibly', 'intelligent', 'age', 'Incredibly', 'also', 'completely', 'lost', 'own', 'world', 'can', 'understand', 'when', 'meet', 'mother', 'later', 'father', 'clothes', 'are', 'enough', 'get', 'beat', 'up', 'singing', 'class', 'getting', 'walked', 'school', 'mom.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'not', 'as', 'predictable', 'Grant', 'getting', 'together', 'Marcus', 'mom', 'would', 'make', 'romance', 'Instead', 'have', 'very', 'quirky', 'set', 'events', 'bring', 'man', 'boy', 'together', 'events', 'are', 'funniest', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'However', 'other', 'scenes', 'are', 'unglamorized', 'look', 'struggles', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'must', 'mention', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'wake-up', 'call', 'given', 'hippy', 'earth-loving', 'culture', 'somewhat', 'border', 'culture', 'b/c', 'love', 'trees', 'earth', 'loose', 'clothing', 'things', 'natural', 'However', 'too', 'far', 'movie', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'happen', 'liberal', 'industry', 'film', 'thought', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'trashed', 'immediately', 'questioned', 'such', 'lifestyles', 'script', 'so', 'intelligent', 'realistic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'agree.Ultimately', 'think', 'interlacing', 'witty', 'genius', 'sincere', 'characters', 'bold', 'commentary', 'realistic', 'emotion', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'never', 'can', 'relax', 'dismiss', 'comedy', 'can', 'never', 'settle', 'dismiss', 'drama', 'incredibly', 'poignant', 'mix', 'antics', 'relationships', 'functional', 'disfunctional', 'sincere', 'characters', 'flaw', 'vivid', 'realism', 'movie', 'time', 'watch', 'have', 'yet', 'get', 'tired', 'movie', 'love', 'sharing', 'joy', 'others']",About a Boy

About a Boy was a box-office smash in England, and went on to charm the world as another fine adaptation of a popular Nick Hornby novel. Hugh Grant is perfectly cast as Will, a self-absorbed trust-fund slacker who tries to improve his romantic odds by preying on desperate single mothers. His cynical strategy backfires when he recruits the misfit son of a suicidal mother to pose as his own son, (which I might add is quite humorous)and proving his parental prowess to his latest single-mom target (alos a classic moment). The kid has a warming effect on this ultimate cad, and what could have been a sappy tearjerker turns into a subtle, frequently hilarious portrait of familial quirks and elevated self-esteem.

I am more of a period film, ""Elizabeth""-type movie lover.  But I was surprised.  During the summer, I made a top ten favorite movie list and this definately defeated Pirates of the Carribean.  It was Hugh Grant's finest film to date and the movie that made Toni Collette shine.  Welcome to About A Boy.This movie focuses on Will, a self-centered, self-proclaimed ""island"" man, meaning he is seperate from the world.  This reason being that he inherits immense amounts of money every time a famous Christmas song, written by his dead father, is sang on television, a movie, etc.  This allows him to be by far the most lazy man in the movies.  He is also quite rude.  It also focuses on a little boy named Marcus with a depressed mother.  And when Will starts to seek single mothers, he and Marcus meet when he goes on a date with a single mother from the group SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together).  He is the son of Toni Collette's character Fiona, who could not go to the gathering and let Marcus go with Will's date.  Soon, when Marcus has some bad experiences at school and at home, they connect and help eachother out in tough situations.This movie is heart warming and quite funny.  A peticular moment made me laugh excessively when Will was going to his first SPAT meeting.  The women are telling stories about their husbands that have abandoned them.  He narrarates the moment with the quote, ""I can tell you one thing: Men are b**tards.""  The only criticism I would have is the movie's length.

This movie reflects on the social aspect of an adolescent boy who is an outcast and a grown up man (who is actually still an immature &quot;boy&quot;)who has everything but does not know his path in life. Together they found and helped each other find happiness. This film is a must for DVD collector's.",5,VERY ENTERTAINING...,1046649600,"03 3, 2003",2003,443,"['movie', 'surprisingly', 'very', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'too', 'cute', 'almost', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'always', 'perfect', 'role', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'movie', 'social', 'aspect', 'adolescent', 'boy', 'who', 'outcast', 'grown', 'up', 'man', 'who', 'actually', 'still', 'immature', 'quot', 'quot', 'who', 'everything', 'not', 'know', 'path', 'life', 'Together', 'found', 'helped', 'other', 'find', 'happiness', 'film', 'must', 'DVD', 'collector']",About a Boy
