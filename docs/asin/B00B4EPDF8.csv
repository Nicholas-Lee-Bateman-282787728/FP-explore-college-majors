We hear insects and birds and the sound of the wind. Curtains calmly flutter, trees vibrate and bend and we hear it. The high definition image is something to treasure. Well, I want to view it on a frozen January day. All of the acting is perfect. Agonies of aging are experienced... to horrific limits. The stupidity of war is revealed from a distance. Music is wonderful. My opinion is that there is nothing in the film that should be kept from children. It's a valuable education on the physical beauty of human beings, and on the many layers of intelligence and decency of women. Old Renoir says that every woman... every one... deserves respect. He does not think of himself as an artist, but as a worker. The women who lovingly carry his chair to beautiful locations for him to work... have all had a part in cherishing him and his ability to nurture them and their children. There are mysterious characters like Jean's young brother. I won't interfere with the flow of this movie by talking about the truth of it all. After you have seen it. Look up the characters. See the films of Jean Renoir. Again, on the rating of the film. Yes, a parent will have to talk about what war is. But, just like the children in the movie... our precious children should learn these things so that they can help us stifle war. Five stars is the limit here... but this movie deserves a few extras.A few days later: I have just viewed Jean Renoir's ""French Can Can."" It is available on dvd, blu-ray from France and also online from Hulu. It is truly amazing... and it is a beautiful reflection of what we learned from the 2013 ""Renoir"" film. In French Can Can, Jean Gabin plays a stage genius who loves women as instruments of beauty who he can teach to perform. The movie is about an artist who, like Jean's father... loves women. My favorite scene is Gabin sitting in a chair offstage visualizing exactly what is happening in the theater... and enjoying it. I can't think of another movie from earlier than the 1960s that looks so spectacular in use of color. It looks old style expensive. Jean is in the film. Edith Piaf is in the movie briefly... singing. The movie is pretty light and cheerful. There is the element of ""people's art"" that reveals Jean Renoir's attitude. What a wonderful follow-up to Renoir 2013. I have seen several other movies made by Jean Renoir, but I will be visiting all that I can now. French Can Can also gets all stars available from me. You will find a version of it on Amazon offered dvd with two other films including the ""Golden Coach""... which I liked very much 20 years ago.",5,like a breeze on a warm day,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,2708,"['loved', 'moment', 'beautiful', 'experience', 'film', 'painted', 'times', 'sound', 'wonderful', 'hear', 'insects', 'birds', 'sound', 'wind', 'Curtains', 'calmly', 'flutter', 'trees', 'vibrate', 'bend', 'hear', 'high', 'definition', 'image', 'something', 'treasure', 'Well', 'want', 'view', 'frozen', 'January', 'day', 'acting', 'perfect', 'Agonies', 'aging', 'are', 'experienced', 'horrific', 'limits', 'stupidity', 'war', 'revealed', 'distance', 'Music', 'wonderful', 'opinion', 'nothing', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'kept', 'children', 'valuable', 'education', 'physical', 'beauty', 'human', 'beings', 'many', 'layers', 'intelligence', 'decency', 'women', 'Old', 'Renoir', 'woman', 'one', 'respect', 'not', 'think', 'artist', 'worker', 'women', 'who', 'lovingly', 'carry', 'chair', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'work', 'have', 'had', 'part', 'cherishing', 'ability', 'nurture', 'children', 'are', 'mysterious', 'characters', 'Jean', 'young', 'brother', 'wo', ""n't"", 'interfere', 'flow', 'movie', 'talking', 'truth', 'have', 'seen', 'Look', 'up', 'characters', 'See', 'films', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'Again', 'rating', 'film', 'Yes', 'parent', 'will', 'have', 'talk', 'what', 'war', 'just', 'children', 'movie', 'precious', 'children', 'should', 'learn', 'things', 'so', 'can', 'help', 'stifle', 'war', 'Five', 'stars', 'limit', 'here', 'movie', 'few', 'extras.A', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'have', 'just', 'viewed', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'French', 'Can', 'Can', 'available', 'dvd', 'blu-ray', 'France', 'also', 'online', 'Hulu', 'truly', 'amazing', 'beautiful', 'reflection', 'what', 'learned', '2013', 'Renoir', 'film', 'French', 'Can', 'Can', 'Jean', 'Gabin', 'stage', 'genius', 'who', 'women', 'instruments', 'beauty', 'who', 'can', 'teach', 'perform', 'movie', 'artist', 'who', 'Jean', 'father', 'women', 'favorite', 'scene', 'Gabin', 'sitting', 'chair', 'offstage', 'visualizing', 'exactly', 'what', 'happening', 'theater', 'enjoying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'earlier', '1960s', 'so', 'spectacular', 'use', 'color', 'old', 'style', 'expensive', 'Jean', 'film', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'movie', 'briefly', 'singing', 'movie', 'pretty', 'light', 'cheerful', 'element', 'people', 'art', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'attitude', 'What', 'wonderful', 'follow-up', 'Renoir', '2013', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'other', 'movies', 'made', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'will', 'be', 'visiting', 'can', 'now', 'French', 'Can', 'Can', 'also', 'stars', 'available', 'will', 'find', 'version', 'Amazon', 'offered', 'dvd', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'including', 'Golden', 'Coach', 'liked', 'very', 'much', '20', 'years', 'ago']",Renoir

Jean Renoir after the war would go on to become a renowned film director. he would write a loving biography of his father in his own older age and then be buried with him.the best portions of the film though are seeing his paintings come to life.  his nude women are part of that summer as they bathe and frolic in the sun and water of southern France.  it is a golden moment in time even though it is surrounded by war which will not end until 1918. if one leaves Renoir's estate, the roads outside are filled with badly maimed soldiers. Renoir the painter is beyond all that of course as his body has him hurtling towards a very soon death and thus he cocoons himself among his art, his family and his retainers. the red haired actress picked to play the nude model is astonishingly like the woman in Renoir's last paintings.  the nudity in the film is the same as the nudity in the paintings.IN REAL LIFE-- jean renoir would marry twice.  the first would be to an actress he used in his early films.  that  would last ten years.  they would divorce and then roughly a decade later he would marry again and stay married until his death. i'm not sure that this young model is supposed to be his first wife, the actress.  the timing doesn't fit his real life timeline but perhaps the director was using some artistic license himself. Pierre Auguste Renoir would die in 1919, four years after the time in this film.  WW I would have just ended. one can appreciate how little medicine and doctors could do for him in 1915.  his rheumatoid arthritis was entirely unrelieved, just for one. few seventy four year olds today are in such physical torment with the maladies that he had.",4,languorously beautiful with minimal plot,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,2317,"['like', 'Renoir', 'art', 'do', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'film', 'even', 'so', 'slowly', 'paced', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'bad', 'pun', 'time', 'passing', 'paint', 'drying', 'slice', 'late', 'life', 'painter', 'Pierre', 'Auguste', 'Renoir', 'seventy', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'terrible', 'health', 'yet', 'painting', 'son', 'Jean', 'joined', 'convalesce', 'home', 'sunny', 'south', 'gorgeous', 'was', 'injured', 'WWI', '1915.the', 'remarkable', 'thing', 'was', 'Pierre', 'Auguste', 'Renoir', 'was', 'very', 'great', 'painter', 'quite', 'obsessed', 'art', 'was', 'not', 'monster', 'children', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'men', 'are', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'war', 'would', 'go', 'become', 'renowned', 'film', 'director', 'would', 'write', 'loving', 'biography', 'father', 'own', 'older', 'age', 'then', 'be', 'buried', 'him.the', 'best', 'portions', 'film', 'are', 'seeing', 'paintings', 'come', 'life', 'nude', 'women', 'are', 'part', 'summer', 'bathe', 'frolic', 'sun', 'water', 'southern', 'France', 'golden', 'moment', 'time', 'even', 'surrounded', 'war', 'will', 'not', 'end', '1918.', 'one', 'Renoir', 'estate', 'roads', 'are', 'filled', 'badly', 'maimed', 'soldiers', 'Renoir', 'painter', 'course', 'body', 'hurtling', 'very', 'soon', 'death', 'thus', 'art', 'family', 'retainers', 'red', 'haired', 'actress', 'picked', 'play', 'nude', 'model', 'astonishingly', 'woman', 'Renoir', 'last', 'paintings', 'nudity', 'film', 'same', 'nudity', 'paintings.IN', 'REAL', 'LIFE', 'jean', 'renoir', 'would', 'marry', 'twice', 'first', 'would', 'be', 'actress', 'used', 'early', 'films', 'would', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'would', 'divorce', 'then', 'roughly', 'decade', 'later', 'would', 'marry', 'again', 'stay', 'married', 'death', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'young', 'model', 'supposed', 'be', 'first', 'wife', 'actress', 'timing', ""n't"", 'fit', 'real', 'life', 'timeline', 'perhaps', 'director', 'was', 'using', 'artistic', 'license', 'Pierre', 'Auguste', 'Renoir', 'would', 'die', '1919', 'four', 'years', 'time', 'film', 'WW', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'ended', 'one', 'can', 'appreciate', 'how', 'little', 'medicine', 'doctors', 'could', 'do', '1915.', 'rheumatoid', 'arthritis', 'was', 'entirely', 'unrelieved', 'just', 'one', 'few', 'seventy', 'four', 'year', 'olds', 'today', 'are', 'such', 'physical', 'torment', 'maladies', 'had']",Renoir

1621559,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00B4EPDF8,Doug Anderson,"[3, 5]","This is a strangely unfocused film about two Renoirs (painter August and filmmaker Jean) and the woman who was something of a muse for both men. But the film can never decide which character and which storyline to explore. At first, it seems this is going to be the young model Andree's story, but other than being nude and free-spirited and inspiring love/lust in each Renoir she meets, we learn very little about her. So, we then assume this is going to be a portrait of the elderly painter (when the film begins he is 74) as seen through the eyes of his young model, but we learn very little about the old painter (other than the fact that he suffers from a debilitating and painful arthritis and that he must be carried to and from his atelier by a group of sturdy female servants who call him ""boss"" and that he lives for the look of light on naked female flesh). About a third of the way through this beautiful but desultory film August's son Jean after being wounded in WWI limps back to the family estate (which sits beautifully on the edge of the sea) and at this point it looks like the film is going to be about Jean's love for Andree but other than a few sensual moments together we learn very little about the connection made between these two. Its only in the afterword of the film, as the credits roll, that we learn that Jean and Andree made several (unsuccessful) silent films together after the war and broke up before Jean became a world famous director. So there is nothing all that compelling going on in this film or anything that seems to add to much -- just a few underdeveloped psychologies and the affect they have on one another for the time that they are together. And yet as soon as you leave the theatre you begin to revisit little bits and pieces. At one point in the film August tells his son Jean that one must not impose structure upon the world but simply float like a cork wherever life takes you ---it would seem that Jean took this advice (one of his most famous films is called The River) but it would also seem that the filmmakers took this advice and decided not to impose a conventional storyline on this slice of Renoir family history. I suppose one could look at this film as a new more honest form of biography/history in that the filmmakers simply offer a series of character impressions without insisting that any single one amounts to more than it does -- and I am inclined to think this is what this film is trying to do. So my first impression (that this film is unfocused, unstructured and slight) is slowly giving way to a second one (that life is unfocused, unstructured, and slight).",4,A Series of Loosely-Connected Impressions,1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,2637,"['strangely', 'unfocused', 'film', 'two', 'Renoirs', 'painter', 'August', 'filmmaker', 'Jean', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'something', 'muse', 'men', 'film', 'can', 'never', 'decide', 'character', 'storyline', 'explore', 'first', 'going', 'be', 'young', 'model', 'Andree', 'story', 'other', 'being', 'nude', 'free-spirited', 'inspiring', 'love/lust', 'Renoir', 'learn', 'very', 'little', 'So', 'then', 'assume', 'going', 'be', 'portrait', 'elderly', 'painter', 'when', 'film', '74', 'seen', 'eyes', 'young', 'model', 'learn', 'very', 'little', 'old', 'painter', 'other', 'fact', 'debilitating', 'painful', 'arthritis', 'must', 'be', 'carried', 'atelier', 'group', 'sturdy', 'female', 'servants', 'who', 'call', 'boss', 'look', 'light', 'naked', 'female', 'flesh', 'third', 'way', 'beautiful', 'desultory', 'film', 'August', 'son', 'Jean', 'being', 'wounded', 'WWI', 'limps', 'back', 'family', 'estate', 'beautifully', 'edge', 'sea', 'point', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'Jean', 'love', 'Andree', 'other', 'few', 'sensual', 'moments', 'together', 'learn', 'very', 'little', 'connection', 'made', 'two', 'only', 'afterword', 'film', 'credits', 'roll', 'learn', 'Jean', 'Andree', 'made', 'several', 'unsuccessful', 'silent', 'films', 'together', 'war', 'broke', 'up', 'Jean', 'became', 'world', 'famous', 'director', 'nothing', 'compelling', 'going', 'film', 'anything', 'add', 'much', 'just', 'few', 'underdeveloped', 'psychologies', 'affect', 'have', 'one', 'time', 'are', 'together', 'yet', 'as', 'soon', 'leave', 'theatre', 'begin', 'revisit', 'little', 'bits', 'pieces', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'August', 'son', 'Jean', 'one', 'must', 'not', 'impose', 'structure', 'world', 'simply', 'float', 'cork', 'life', '-it', 'would', 'seem', 'Jean', 'took', 'advice', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'films', 'called', 'River', 'would', 'also', 'seem', 'filmmakers', 'took', 'advice', 'decided', 'not', 'impose', 'conventional', 'storyline', 'slice', 'Renoir', 'family', 'history', 'suppose', 'one', 'could', 'look', 'film', 'new', 'more', 'honest', 'form', 'biography/history', 'filmmakers', 'simply', 'offer', 'series', 'character', 'impressions', 'insisting', 'single', 'one', 'more', 'am', 'inclined', 'think', 'what', 'film', 'trying', 'do', 'So', 'first', 'impression', 'film', 'unfocused', 'unstructured', 'slight', 'slowly', 'giving', 'way', 'second', 'one', 'life', 'unfocused', 'unstructured', 'slight']",Renoir
1621560,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00B4EPDF8,Doug Park,"[29, 31]","Appropriately enough, about the world's most famous Impressionist painter.While definitely not for those who favor conventionally plotted drama or fast action, RENOIR consists of immediate realism and puts you right there with the Renoir clan on the French Riviera. It's the sort of film that could easily have been made overly artsy and dull, but it's neither.The entire film takes place in 1915, toward the end of Renoir's life. The relationship between model Andr&eacute;e Heuschling and son Jean Renoir is, in many ways, more the subject of the story than the painter himself, yet Renoir himself is indispensable as ""the boss,"" a sort of god-like backdrop to the entire cast and story. Having said that, I must add that there is a fair amount on Renoir's artistic processes, and his philosophizing can be applied to all sorts of art forms besides painting. One of RENOIR's strongest aspects is its portrayal of a man who is obsessed with his work and has one thing that utterly consumes him.Like many other French films, RENOIR succeeds in breaking all sorts of rules, among them:--The plot is meandering and somewhat slice-of-life but still gripping;--Andr&eacute;e, the ""girl from nowhere,"" and free but neglected youngest son Coco are characters that beg to be developed further, but at the same time, perhaps it's better that they remain mysterious;--Lots of female nudity without it seeming the least bit gratuitous: After all, the subject is an artist who often painted naked girls;--The mood is a successful mesh of somberness, poignancy, and (often laugh-out-loud) humor.Just about every artsy clich&eacute; could be applied to this film, but suffice it to say that it is a beautiful experience. Even simple colors come alive here for the audience as they did for Renoir himself. I'm a word person who's never been a big painting aficionado, but this film made me see the visual arts in a whole new light and may even have converted me to some extent.

More than a simple story, this film is a recreation of the view of nature and of the human figure as bathed in that special light of the countryside of France. It is as much an artwork as t is a biographical view of one of history's great painters.The Cte d'Azur, 1915. In his twilight years, Pierre-Auguste Renoir (Michel Bouquet) is tormented by the loss of his wife, the pains of rheumatoid arthritis severely limiting his movement, wheelchair-bound, and the agony of hearing that his son Jean (Vincent Rottiers) has been wounded in the action of WW I. His household is tended by maids who have been previous models, and his youngest son Coco (Thomas Doret) who suffers from the lack of attention from his still grieving father. But when a young girl miraculously enters his world, the old painter is filled with a new, wholly unexpected energy. Blazing with life, radiantly beautiful, Andr&eacute;e Heuschling (Christa Theret) will become his last model, who rejuvenates, enchants, and inspires both father and son. Returning to the family home to convalesce, Jean too falls under the spell of the new, redheaded star in the Renoir firmament. In their Mediterranean Eden - and in the face of his father's fierce opposition - he falls in love with this wild, untamable spirit... and as he does so, within weak-willed, battle-shaken Jean, a filmmaker begins to grow.Bathed in the cinematography glow of Ping Bin Lee and the subtle, sensual musical score by Alexandre Desplat and greatly enhanced by a pitch perfect cast, this film is more of a mood piece than a biopic. At film's end we are informed of the lives of the characters; Jean married Andr&eacute;e and they made very successful films together until their divorce (Jean Renoir become one of the most highly regarded film directors in history, dying in 1979 - the year that the then destitute Andr&eacute;e died, Coco (Claude) Renoir gained fame as a ceramic artist, and the eldest on Pierre became an actor whose son became the brilliant film maker Claude Renoir). It is an important moment in the history of art and a quietly pensive study of the mind of artists and their models. Highly recommended.

Snyder,"[1, 1]","Renoir brings to the screen many beautiful scenes which have been painstakingly staged to make them look as much like an Impressionist painting as possible, with exquisite color and carefully controlled light. The cover of the Blu-ray depicts just such a painterly scene, portraying a young couple sitting in a sun-drenched field, with a lattice of leaves on slender drooping branches.Pierre Auguste Renoir was, along with Claude Monet, one of the originators of Impressionist techniques in painting. The film chronicles a year near the end of his life, during the Great War, later to be known as World War I. Two of his sons were of military service age, the oldest being in the Air Corps, the second being in the Army, and after recuperation at home from a wound, the second son also joined the Air Corps. The story depicted in the film is centered on Renoir and his second son, Jean, who after the war followed his passion for film and became one of France's greatest directors.Renoir was in his seventies during the time depicted in the film, old beyond his years due to severe rheumatoid arthritis which gnarled and crippled his hands. He had his brushes tied to his hands, and continued to paint. The makeup for Renoir's hands is so authentic looking that I wondered if the actor was actually afflicted with arthritis, but the extras reveal that he was not. The flow of action in this film is deliberately paced, realistic, and beautiful. Father, Son and The Girl are the main characters, the latter being a model for Pierre and a love interest for Jean.The film Renoir carries an R rating due to numerous scenes of nudity with the posing of the artist's model or models, and a relatively few strongly worded expressions, none gratuitous and all befitting the moment. Dialogue is in French, with subtitles. The film is a delight to watch because of its visual beauty and its believable storyline, showing a famous family in a time of national crisis. It is a tribute in delicate colors to a great artist and a vanished era.",5,A Beautiful Look at the Last Years of an Impressionist Master,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",2014,2029,"['Renoir', 'screen', 'many', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'painstakingly', 'staged', 'make', 'look', 'much', 'Impressionist', 'painting', 'possible', 'exquisite', 'color', 'carefully', 'controlled', 'light', 'cover', 'Blu-ray', 'depicts', 'just', 'painterly', 'scene', 'portraying', 'young', 'couple', 'sitting', 'sun-drenched', 'field', 'lattice', 'leaves', 'slender', 'drooping', 'branches.Pierre', 'Auguste', 'Renoir', 'was', 'Claude', 'Monet', 'one', 'originators', 'Impressionist', 'techniques', 'painting', 'film', 'year', 'end', 'life', 'Great', 'War', 'later', 'be', 'known', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'sons', 'were', 'military', 'service', 'age', 'oldest', 'being', 'Air', 'Corps', 'second', 'being', 'Army', 'recuperation', 'home', 'wound', 'second', 'son', 'also', 'joined', 'Air', 'Corps', 'story', 'depicted', 'film', 'centered', 'Renoir', 'second', 'son', 'Jean', 'who', 'war', 'followed', 'passion', 'film', 'became', 'one', 'France', 'greatest', 'directors.Renoir', 'was', 'seventies', 'time', 'depicted', 'film', 'old', 'years', 'due', 'severe', 'rheumatoid', 'arthritis', 'gnarled', 'crippled', 'hands', 'had', 'brushes', 'tied', 'hands', 'continued', 'paint', 'makeup', 'Renoir', 'hands', 'so', 'authentic', 'looking', 'wondered', 'actor', 'was', 'actually', 'afflicted', 'arthritis', 'extras', 'reveal', 'was', 'not', 'flow', 'action', 'film', 'deliberately', 'paced', 'realistic', 'beautiful', 'Father', 'Son', 'Girl', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'latter', 'being', 'model', 'Pierre', 'love', 'interest', 'Jean.The', 'film', 'Renoir', 'R', 'rating', 'due', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'posing', 'artist', 'model', 'models', 'relatively', 'few', 'strongly', 'worded', 'expressions', 'none', 'gratuitous', 'befitting', 'moment', 'Dialogue', 'French', 'subtitles', 'film', 'delight', 'watch', 'visual', 'beauty', 'believable', 'storyline', 'showing', 'famous', 'family', 'time', 'national', 'crisis', 'tribute', 'delicate', 'colors', 'great', 'artist', 'vanished', 'era']",Renoir

1621569,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00B4EPDF8,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","This beautiful film tells the story of two Renoirs.  Pierre-Auguste (Michel Bouquet), the famous French Impressionist painter and his son Jean who went on to become an acclaimed filmmaker.  In 1915 the elder Renoir is an aging seventies-something, confined to a wheel chair, essentially infirm.  His hands are wrought with pain caused by ever more crippling arthritis.  Still he paints daily, with a cadre of maids, most of whom were once his models, helping to transport him to various locations on his estate on the French Riviera.  They tie his fingers together so he can hold a brush and wash them down with ice at the end of the day.Renoir's wife has recently died.  He has 2 sons off to war against the Kaiser and a boy of about 14 still at home.  Looking for a young model, Renoir hires a young comely woman named Andree (Christa Theret).  If my facts are correct, in real life she would have been 15, but appears to be about 18 in the film.  Ms. Theret was actually 21 when the film was made.  I only point this out as Renoir's models were usually nude or partially nude in his paintings.  Andree becomes Renoir's muse and he finds new life in his work, even as his body continues to deteriorate.Young Jean (Vincent Rottiers) returns home from the war to recuperate from a severe leg wound.  After some time Jean and Andree's love of movies brings them together.  The movie features some great photography by Ping Bin Lee, consistent with the great work of the master, Renoir.  Alexandre Desplat's score adds a nice warmth to the various scenes.  Fair warning however, the film is ploddingly slow.  There really isn't much going on.  Some squabbles, the youngest son getting into occasional trouble.  So action seekers or just people looking for some drama won't find it here.  Director Gilles Bourdos clearly set out to deliver a great film to look at.  The spunky Theret's interpretation of Christa does give the film a bit of flavor.  She reminds me of Brigitte Bardot's character in ""...And God Created Woman"" both in physical appearance and sass.As a footnote Jean married Andree and she went on to act under the name Catherine Hessling and he went on to direct some great films including one of my favorites ""The Rules of the Game"" in 1939.The Blu ray version of this film is a terrific transfer, properly showcasing the great film portraits of the French countryside.  Flesh colors are accurate.  The film has excellent clarity and detail.  Check out the various coats the men wear.  The audio is also very good with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track in French (with English subtitles).  The scenes along a river bank quietly show the audio dispersion to the surrounds as well as other mostly exterior scenes.  Extras consist of interviews with Bouquet and Rottiers and a trailer but that's it.",4,(BLU RAY REVIEW)  3 1/2 stars for a beautiful film to watch,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,2807,"['beautiful', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'Renoirs', 'Pierre-Auguste', 'Michel', 'Bouquet', 'famous', 'French', 'Impressionist', 'painter', 'son', 'Jean', 'who', 'went', 'become', 'acclaimed', 'filmmaker', '1915', 'elder', 'Renoir', 'aging', 'seventies-something', 'confined', 'wheel', 'chair', 'essentially', 'infirm', 'hands', 'are', 'wrought', 'pain', 'caused', 'ever', 'more', 'crippling', 'arthritis', 'Still', 'daily', 'cadre', 'maids', 'most', 'whom', 'were', 'once', 'models', 'helping', 'transport', 'various', 'locations', 'estate', 'French', 'Riviera', 'tie', 'fingers', 'together', 'can', 'hold', 'brush', 'wash', 'down', 'ice', 'end', 'day.Renoir', 'wife', 'recently', 'died', '2', 'sons', 'war', 'Kaiser', 'boy', '14', 'still', 'home', 'Looking', 'young', 'model', 'Renoir', 'young', 'comely', 'woman', 'named', 'Andree', 'Christa', 'Theret', 'facts', 'are', 'correct', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', '15', 'be', 'about', '18', 'film', 'Ms.', 'Theret', 'was', 'actually', '21', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'only', 'point', 'out', 'Renoir', 'models', 'were', 'usually', 'nude', 'partially', 'nude', 'paintings', 'Andree', 'Renoir', 'muse', 'new', 'life', 'work', 'even', 'body', 'deteriorate.Young', 'Jean', 'Vincent', 'Rottiers', 'home', 'war', 'recuperate', 'severe', 'leg', 'wound', 'time', 'Jean', 'Andree', 'love', 'movies', 'together', 'movie', 'great', 'photography', 'Ping', 'Bin', 'Lee', 'consistent', 'great', 'work', 'master', 'Renoir', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'score', 'nice', 'warmth', 'various', 'scenes', 'Fair', 'warning', 'however', 'film', 'ploddingly', 'slow', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'going', 'squabbles', 'youngest', 'son', 'getting', 'occasional', 'trouble', 'action', 'seekers', 'just', 'people', 'looking', 'drama', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'Director', 'Gilles', 'Bourdos', 'clearly', 'set', 'out', 'deliver', 'great', 'film', 'look', 'spunky', 'Theret', 'interpretation', 'Christa', 'give', 'film', 'bit', 'flavor', 'Brigitte', 'Bardot', 'character', 'God', 'Created', 'Woman', 'physical', 'appearance', 'sass.As', 'footnote', 'Jean', 'married', 'Andree', 'went', 'act', 'name', 'Catherine', 'Hessling', 'went', 'direct', 'great', 'films', 'including', 'one', 'favorites', 'Rules', 'Game', '1939.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'version', 'film', 'terrific', 'transfer', 'properly', 'showcasing', 'great', 'film', 'portraits', 'French', 'countryside', 'Flesh', 'colors', 'are', 'accurate', 'film', 'excellent', 'clarity', 'detail', 'Check', 'various', 'coats', 'men', 'wear', 'audio', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'scenes', 'river', 'bank', 'quietly', 'show', 'audio', 'dispersion', 'surrounds', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'mostly', 'exterior', 'scenes', 'Extras', 'consist', 'interviews', 'Bouquet', 'Rottiers', 'trailer']",Renoir

Instead, it retells one particular summer, set in 1915 in southern France. As the movie opens, we see a young woman named Andr&eacute;e (played by Christa Theret) approaching the house of the Renoir family. Possessing a stunning beauty, she was recommended to be Renoir's newest model. Renoir at that point is already in his mid-70s, and endures various physical ailments. In the house there appear to be a group of women who at one point may have been models but ended up staying as maids. We learn that Renoir has three sons, of which the oldest two are now fighting in World War I. Then about one-third into the movie, one of them, the middle brother Jean, returns home from the war, having been heavily wounded. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this movie is one of the most gorgeous looking movies I have seen in a long time. A number of the scenes recreate Renoir painting and to me it feels like every scene in the movie is like a painting come to life. Second, this movie moves as snail's pace, and I mean this as a compliment. It is, I suppose, in part a reflection of life a century ago, when everything moved slower and people had more time on their hands. Third, it takes quite a while for the movie to find its emotional footing, as in the first hour we simply get to know the various characters and how they fill their days. Fourth, WWI plays a major role in the movie, and in fact weighs heavily on the movie from start to finishg. Fifth, kudos to Michel Bouquet, a legend of French cinema (he was 85 when this movie was filmed), in the title role. To be that age and getting such a challenging role! Bouquet delivers a tour-de-force in my opinion. The other headliners (Christa Theret as Andr&eacute;e and Vincent Rottiers as Jean Renoir) are also fine but are overshadowed by Bouquet. Lastly, beware there is quite a bit of 'artistic nudity' in the movie (although I thought it was never gratuitous or offensive). Bottom line: this is a beautiful, slow-moving movie that gives a glimpse into August Renoir's later life. Be sure to stick around for the end credits as we are told what became of the various characters later in their lives. As a complete aside, the parallels between this movie and another recent French-language movie called ""The Artist and the Model"" (starring that other legendary French actor Jean Rochefort), which I just saw this past weekend, are striking.I saw ""Renoir"" at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati in May of this year, and am glad to see that it has finally been listed here on Amazon as a future DVD release. When I saw it, I was quite surprised how packed the theatre was (mostly seniors, I might add).

A thin, willowy woman with light skin, red hair, and a fiery disposition, Catherine captivates the heart of the old painter who is referred to by the estate's retinue as ""boss"". She also captures the interest of Renoir's pre-adolescent youngest son who otherwise has little to do on the estate as his mother has just died and the painter is not much taken with the duties of fatherhood.Midway in the film, Renoir's middle son, Jean, 22, returns to the estate with a serious leg wound. As with many young men, Jean has not found his path in life although he displays an inkling towards film. He too is captivated by Catherine, whom he ultimately marries, creating a tension between himself and his father.Although it discusses war, age, youth, and art, the movie centers upon Catherine, in her character and her body. Large sections of the film are given over to Catherine posing nude for Renoir, to his inspiration and to that of the viewer. The film emphasizes the beauty of the flesh and on its transformation on canvas to art. Flesh, sensuality, and love contrast with the horrors of the war raging not far away. Both Jean and the younger Renoir son are smitten with Catherine as she poses. She is in disposition independent, somewhat calculating, and the possessor of a sharp temper.The film moves slowly with little dramatic tension. The body of Catherine and Renoir's estate are the primary visual attractions. Still, the aging artist is portrayed sympathetically and well, and the film offers a glimpse into the future of Renoir's gifted son. Together with his films Jean Renoir would also write a biography of his father.The movie is in French with subtitles. Interestingly, Bourdos hired a convicted art forger to recreate the many Renoir paintings shown in the course of the movie. He did a masterful job. This is a lovely film about a physically beautiful woman and her impact a famous father and son. The movie will capture for the viewer, as Catherine did for the Renoirs, the allure and sensuality of a beautiful nude female form.Robin Friedman",4,The Model,1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,2628,"['Directed', 'Gilles', 'Bourdos', 'Renoir', 'story', 'old', 'age', 'great', 'French', 'painter', 'Pierre', 'Auguste', 'Renoir', '1841', '1919', 'played', 'Michel', 'Bouquet', 'coming-of-age', 'son', 'filmaker', 'Jean', 'Renoir', '1894', '1979', 'played', 'Vincent', 'Rottiers', 'film', 'set', '1915', 'WW', 'rages', 'Renoir', 'lovely', 'estate', 'southern', 'France', 'catalyst', 'film', 'aging', 'Renoir', 'last', 'model', 'Catherine', 'Andree', 'Heuschling', 'played', 'Christa', 'Theret', 'who', 'unannounced', 'estate', 'spring', 'day', 'become', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'Renoir', 'last', 'model', 'thin', 'willowy', 'woman', 'light', 'skin', 'red', 'hair', 'fiery', 'disposition', 'Catherine', 'heart', 'old', 'painter', 'who', 'referred', 'estate', 'retinue', 'boss', 'also', 'interest', 'Renoir', 'pre-adolescent', 'youngest', 'son', 'who', 'otherwise', 'little', 'do', 'estate', 'mother', 'just', 'died', 'painter', 'not', 'much', 'taken', 'duties', 'fatherhood.Midway', 'film', 'Renoir', 'middle', 'son', 'Jean', '22', 'returns', 'estate', 'serious', 'leg', 'wound', 'many', 'young', 'men', 'Jean', 'not', 'found', 'path', 'life', 'inkling', 'towards', 'film', 'too', 'captivated', 'Catherine', 'whom', 'ultimately', 'creating', 'tension', 'father.Although', 'war', 'age', 'youth', 'art', 'movie', 'centers', 'Catherine', 'character', 'body', 'Large', 'sections', 'film', 'are', 'given', 'Catherine', 'posing', 'nude', 'Renoir', 'inspiration', 'viewer', 'film', 'beauty', 'flesh', 'transformation', 'canvas', 'art', 'Flesh', 'sensuality', 'love', 'contrast', 'horrors', 'war', 'raging', 'not', 'far', 'away', 'Jean', 'younger', 'Renoir', 'son', 'are', 'smitten', 'Catherine', 'disposition', 'independent', 'somewhat', 'calculating', 'possessor', 'sharp', 'temper.The', 'film', 'moves', 'slowly', 'little', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'body', 'Catherine', 'Renoir', 'estate', 'are', 'primary', 'visual', 'attractions', 'Still', 'aging', 'artist', 'portrayed', 'sympathetically', 'well', 'film', 'glimpse', 'future', 'Renoir', 'gifted', 'son', 'Together', 'films', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'would', 'also', 'write', 'biography', 'father.The', 'movie', 'French', 'subtitles', 'Interestingly', 'Bourdos', 'hired', 'convicted', 'art', 'forger', 'recreate', 'many', 'Renoir', 'paintings', 'shown', 'course', 'movie', 'did', 'masterful', 'job', 'lovely', 'film', 'physically', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'impact', 'famous', 'father', 'son', 'movie', 'will', 'capture', 'viewer', 'Catherine', 'did', 'Renoirs', 'allure', 'sensuality', 'beautiful', 'nude', 'female', 'form.Robin', 'Friedman']",Renoir
