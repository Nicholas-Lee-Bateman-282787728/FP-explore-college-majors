It is the third film in the Cube film series, but is a prequel to the first film. Even though the first two films take place almost entirely within the maze, Cube Zero takes place in both the interior and exterior of the cube, making significant use of outdoor scenes. This movie explains the origins of the Cube and the people that control it.",5,Awesome,1354492800,"12 3, 2012",2012,450,"['Cube', 'Zero', '2004', 'Canadian', 'psychological', 'thriller/horror', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Ernie', 'Barbarash', 'third', 'film', 'Cube', 'film', 'series', 'prequel', 'first', 'film', 'Even', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'almost', 'entirely', 'maze', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'place', 'interior', 'exterior', 'cube', 'making', 'significant', 'use', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'movie', 'origins', 'Cube', 'people', 'control']",N/A

Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 3]","If you go into this film expecting wild rides and visuals that will leave your socks at the other end of the room, you will be utterly disappointed.  Now, if you walk into this film expecting a lower-than-low budget, some slightly above average acting, with a fun twist at the end that seems to aptly tie the series only closer together, than you will enjoy this film.  I, personally, walked in with no expectations.  I was a huge fan of the original Cube film and even of the second film (the one that most disliked) called Cube 2: Hypercube.  I thought that overall the story was strong and it opened more doors and possibilities to the birth of this unknown monolith.  So, when the opportunity came about to see this film, I walked into it skeptical.  How well could a ""prequel"" be to a series that already started so well?  Again, not expecting much is key to enjoying this film.To begin, the story is decent.  While I do believe it overloaded itself by answering too many questions, it did provide us with this world outside the cube that seemed like a cross between Brazil and The X-Files.  This was great because it provided us with a visual of the unknown that our minds have grappled with throughout the entire series, but it also hurt the film because it did put that ""visual"" on the unknown.  Half the excitement from the second two films was that you never really knew who or what was behind the chaos and destruction that these unwilling participants encountered.  I will say that this film leaves the door still open to several possibilities, but the questions that were answered seem to shut so many more.  The fear of the first two films was the participants inside the machine that didn't know the menacing smile of the person watching their death, we also experienced that fear because there was that ""unknown"".  Now, the ""unknown"" is answered (somewhat) and it doesn't quite paint the picture that was created in my mind.I don't want to sound like I am crashing this film into the ground, far from it, but there were several moments while I was watching this movie that I thought to myself, ""well, that kinda works for me..."" as if I was agreeing with the images that the director chose to use.  You know all these years I kept saying to myself that I wanted the answers, yet now that they are presented to me, I am not happy.  There was nothing that the director, cast, or even the writers did to make me feel that way, but I just didn't feel comfortable with the translation.  It was like seeing your Christmas presents the day before and having to pretend to be excited when you open them ten hours later.  It is very difficult.  Again, I don't want it to seem as if I am cutting this film, because I thought that it added a decent chapter to the series, just not the best chapter.The acting was at par or a bit under for this film.  You could tell that budget was not as big as the first or second film, but the passion that director Ernie Barbarash (who worked as writer and producer of the second Cube film) has for this series and for this story is unmatched.  He tries diligently to bring new and exciting characters to the screen, while also keeping us familiar with the other films.  He doesn't try to build a new cube and give us this artsy feeling of originality, he keeps consistent, and you can definitely give him credit for that.  I just wish he had built more suspense with the story.  I was patiently waiting on the edge of my seat for this big ""hurrah"" at the end, or perhaps middle, but it only seemed to sizzle and give me the excitement of a small bottle rocket exploding.  There was a ""cute"" twist at the end that helps build for Cube, but mustering up the strength to tell your grandmother would be a waste of time.This may be the most confusing review that I have ever written because there is this gray fuzzy line staring me in the face.  I love the movie, yet disliked the images that it produced for me.  It was innovative, but nothing spectacular.  It will be added to my collection, but does not rank among my favorites.  There was some great work done by Barbarash, but nothing more than a pat on the back.  He did good work and he did hard work, but was this exactly what the series needed?  The religious undertones coupled with the apparent ""superhero"" themes felt like bits of cheese on a wafer of metal known as the cube.  Barbarash, I think, had a bigger plan for this film, but do to apparent budgetary cutbacks, he just couldn't fit everything together.Overall, I loved this film, and yet I had problems with it.  It was an apparent ""Eyah"" film.  I had so much excitement for it because of my keen interest on the two other films that I think it hurt my imagination and theories behind the cube more than help define this machine better.  The segway near the end excited me, yet at the same time felt forced and needed to appease the original Cube fans.  This film will make it to my collection of films one-day, but it does not rank up well compared to the films that are supposed to succeed it.  I recommend this film only to die-hard Cube fans, but to the untrained eye, this will not brood over well.Arg, I give up.Grade: **** out of *****",4,Questions? Comments?

However, I have enjoyed Cube Zero in a very different way than either of its predecessors.  Cube Zero is a completely new concept with the premise of the cube still serving as a framework to set up the plot.  Those viewers renting this movie with the hope of experiencing more cube-like action, where a team of helpless people try to decipher internal workings of a complicated death maze, could be rather disappointed.  Cube Zero is not really a story about finding a way out of a maze. Instead, it is a discourse on ideas of authority and obedience.  How far will an underling go taking orders from his superiors without conflicting with his own ideals?  Will you go out of your way to help a stranger by sacrificing your life?I guess the biggest downfall of Cube 0 is that now it has demystified the enigmatic Cube.  We still do not know everything about why Cube was invented and who has the final level of control but we do get enough to satiate our curiosity.  Part of the reason why the original Cube was so hard to forget was that it ended without explaining the purpose of the cube and why people were put into it.  Now we more or less know the answer.

875521,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0006Z2LH4,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[31, 35]","Hello all you cubists out there...ready for another round of cubery?  That's right, they made yet another sequel (in this case a prequel) to Cube (1997), the little film that creeped into the video market and became immensely popular mainly through word of mouth advertising, so much so it warranted a sequel in Cube 2: Hypercube, which begat this prequel titled Cube Zero (I assumed it was a prequel given the combination of the title and the tagline on the front of the DVD case, `Every nightmare has a beginning.'  My deductions turned out to be accurate, and thus I rewarded myself with a cookie.)  Written and directed by Ernie Barbarash (he also wrote the sequel Cube 2: Hypercube, but did not direct it), the film, like its predecessors, features a relatively unknown cast (to me, at least) of Canadians, in Zachary Bennett (Guest Room), Stephanie Moore (John Q), Michael Riley (Amistad), and David Huband (Wrong Turn).The story starts off in rather grisly fashion, much like the previous films, in that we witness the inherent dangers of cube reality after a lone man stumbles upon one of the many traps contained within the cube, and meets a particularly gooey fate.  This element was a real punch in the gut with the first film, but now the inclusion of a nasty death by peculiar manner at the outset has become the norm...I guess if something works, you stick with it...and it established that we are, in fact, watching a Cube movie.  Anyway, it's after this we find ourselves in a dank, dimly lit control room of sorts, filled with piping, monitors, filing cabinets, and populated by two individuals, one young, smart, and full of questions, the other older, by the book sort of man (Bennett and Huband, respectively) who turn out to be technicians (yet they wear the same outfits as those poor schleps who are deposited in the cube), monitoring the activity within the cube, recorded everything for posterity, I suppose (actually, they receive orders from an as yet undetermined source).  This behind the scenes peek initiates the possibility that all the questions and mystery developed over the course of the last two films may soon be answered and solved, but tease as they will, tease as they might, there shall be little in the form of answers tonight...things begin to unravel when one of the two techs, a real brainiac with the ability to visualize complex structures within his head, falls for a woman in the cube, and leaves the safety of the frying pan and jumps into the fire, which marks the appearance of Jax (Riley), a higher up assigned to deal with this particular problem, by means of manipulating the computer controlled cube and its traps.  I'm really hesitant to give out any more, as I hate to spoil anymore of the film for someone who hasn't had the opportunity to see it...While I did like the film (it was certainly better than Cube 2), I always felt any sequels to the original were unnecessary.  The first film worked so well in giving us the confines of the cube, and then presenting so many questions that were never answered, and probably never meant to be answered, forcing viewers to speculate, theorize, and ultimately develop their own ideas.  The following films, trying to build off the original, offer little tidbits, but only with the intention of deliberately raising more questions, creating a sort of self-perpetuating mystery.  This same, exact thing was done with the movie Phantasm (1979), a great little horror film that presented a wonderful, obtuse set of questions, which were never answered, but many things alluded to in the cruddy, subsequent sequels.  I doubt at the time either of these films, Cube or Phantasm, were made, there was probably much thought to sequels, so they were made in the context of being stand alone films...perhaps I'm being a bit hypocritical about my thoughts of preserving the `sanctity' of the originals, as if I was truly concerned with that, I would have never watched the movies that followed...given that this is a prequel, the appearance of the interior of the cube related that well, having a rough, unpolished look, like that of something still being developed, awaiting refinements and upgrades.  The introduction of new traps (one featured a particularly nasty disease) was fun and welcomed.  The focus of the story varied from the previous films in that it wasn't confined to individuals within the cube, but spread out a little more.  This effectively lessens the character development of a small, core group of cube dwellers, but I did appreciate the fact we didn't have to spend another film limited to only the interior of the cube.  I liked the introduction of the mysterious character of Jax, but I thought Riley's performance a little too comical and overboard, reminding me a lot of John Glover's corporate mogul character Daniel Clamp from the film Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990).  And what was the deal with the person who actually made it out of the cube and the introduction of the religious implication?  It felt awkward and out of place with the rest of the film.  All in all, Cube Zero was a good time, and for those interested I don't think you'll be disappointed.The widescreen picture, presented in 16:9 aspect ratio looks decent, but probably could have looked better, as the darker scenes didn't always come across as well as they could have.  The audio is clear, and present in Dolby Digital 5.1, along with Dolby Digital 2.0.  Special features include a 20-minute featurette titled `Inside the Box', along with a director's commentary, storyboard comparisons, an art gallery, and a music video by some cruddy band featuring the lead singer moving though sets from the film singing an entirely forgettable piece of metal.  There's also some trailers for other Lions Gate releases like Saw (2004), Final Cut (2004), and High Tension (2003).  3  starsCookieman108An afterthought...perhaps the next film could be called

875522,A1RD1LL5E5JZOT,B0006Z2LH4,"Crookedmouth "":-/""","[0, 0]","You wake up, alone, on the floor of a cell - you can't remember why you're there or how you got there. The cell is 14 foot on each side and there is a hatch one each of the four walls and on the floor and ceiling, each leading to another identical cell. You have to find your way out of the complex before you die of thirst, but your way is beset by lethal (and rather gruesome) boobytraps.This is the third (and so far the last) of the Cube series and it acts (apparently) as a prequel to the series. Following from the remake/reimagining ""Hypercube"" (much maligned, and in my opinion, unfairly so) Cube Zero returns to the roots of the concept; the cell system is mechanical in design and industrial in its feel. The setting is certainly very atmospheric and eerie and I think that on balance it wins over Hypercube's surgical/sci-fi environment.Despite the familiarity of the setting, this last film differs somewhat from it's predecessors in several ways. Firstly, we are provided with a backstory for the protagonist, Rains and, secondly, a good deal of the film is set outside the cube in the cube control room (and even the outside world) from where the plight of the prisoners is often observed from the perspective of the cube's technicians/controllers. I guess that after two films which never ventured outside the confines of the prison cells, this move was probably inevitable; the questions posed by C1 and C2 could hardly be left unanswered for a third time. Nevertheless, much of the motivation of the cube's designers still remains hidden to a degree.Apart from that, the film follows the same formula as its predecessors, with a few small deviations and it is unsurprising then that exterior becomes the more interesting environment. We discover that the technicians seem to have as little idea of their purpose or origin as their subjects, and similarly little exposure to the outside world. When it is revealed that several of their number have disappeared, they even invent lame excuses to avoid unpalatable questions. Even when a supervisor arrives to take control of a deteriorating situation, all we learn is that there are layer upon layer of management and no answers to be had.Conceptually, this is definitely the strongest of the three films. Far from clarifying the mythos, and therefore breaking the spell, the film adds to the mystery by introducing external influences. The setting is also made all the richer by the introduction of the control room and it appears that the set designers had a lot of fun building the detail and backstory into ths environment - the leaking roof, the banks of filing cabinets, the fish in the coffee perc and the mysterious elevator.The cast is fairly standard cube-fodder and yet again, the more interesting characters are the ones outside the cube: Zachary Bennett and David Huband do a decent job as the Cube technicians, but honorable mention should go to Michael Riley who overacts shamelessly as Jax, the ridiculously sinister and sarcastic supervisor. He plays the role like a parody of a typical Bond baddie and, while some may dislike the overacting, I thought that it added a bit more depth to the scenery.This is, ostensibly, a prequel to Cube 1. I am not entirely convinced that it is obvious that it sits earlier in the canon and I suspect that it is best watched after the first film.",4,Superior prequel to an innovative series,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,3362,"['wake', 'up', 'alone', 'floor', 'cell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'why', ""'re"", 'how', 'got', 'there', 'cell', '14', 'foot', 'side', 'hatch', 'one', 'four', 'walls', 'floor', 'ceiling', 'leading', 'identical', 'cell', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'complex', 'die', 'thirst', 'way', 'beset', 'lethal', 'rather', 'gruesome', 'boobytraps.This', 'third', 'so', 'far', 'last', 'Cube', 'series', 'apparently', 'prequel', 'series', 'Following', 'remake/reimagining', 'Hypercube', 'much', 'maligned', 'opinion', 'unfairly', 'so', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'roots', 'concept', 'cell', 'system', 'mechanical', 'design', 'industrial', 'feel', 'setting', 'certainly', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'eerie', 'think', 'balance', 'Hypercube', 'surgical/sci-fi', 'environment.Despite', 'familiarity', 'setting', 'last', 'film', 'differs', 'somewhat', 'predecessors', 'several', 'ways', 'Firstly', 'are', 'provided', 'backstory', 'protagonist', 'Rains', 'secondly', 'good', 'deal', 'film', 'set', 'cube', 'cube', 'control', 'room', 'even', 'outside', 'world', 'where', 'plight', 'prisoners', 'often', 'observed', 'perspective', 'cube', 'technicians/controllers', 'guess', 'two', 'films', 'never', 'ventured', 'confines', 'prison', 'cells', 'move', 'was', 'probably', 'inevitable', 'questions', 'posed', 'C1', 'C2', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'left', 'unanswered', 'third', 'time', 'Nevertheless', 'much', 'motivation', 'cube', 'designers', 'still', 'hidden', 'degree.Apart', 'film', 'same', 'formula', 'predecessors', 'few', 'small', 'deviations', 'unsurprising', 'then', 'exterior', 'more', 'interesting', 'environment', 'discover', 'technicians', 'seem', 'have', 'as', 'little', 'idea', 'purpose', 'origin', 'subjects', 'similarly', 'little', 'exposure', 'outside', 'world', 'When', 'revealed', 'several', 'number', 'have', 'disappeared', 'even', 'invent', 'lame', 'excuses', 'avoid', 'unpalatable', 'questions', 'Even', 'when', 'supervisor', 'take', 'control', 'deteriorating', 'situation', 'learn', 'are', 'layer', 'layer', 'management', 'answers', 'be', 'had.Conceptually', 'definitely', 'strongest', 'three', 'films', 'Far', 'clarifying', 'mythos', 'therefore', 'breaking', 'spell', 'film', 'mystery', 'introducing', 'external', 'influences', 'setting', 'also', 'made', 'richer', 'introduction', 'control', 'room', 'set', 'designers', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'building', 'detail', 'backstory', 'ths', 'environment', 'leaking', 'roof', 'banks', 'filing', 'cabinets', 'fish', 'coffee', 'perc', 'mysterious', 'elevator.The', 'cast', 'fairly', 'standard', 'cube-fodder', 'yet', 'again', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'ones', 'cube', 'Zachary', 'Bennett', 'David', 'Huband', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'Cube', 'technicians', 'honorable', 'mention', 'should', 'go', 'Michael', 'Riley', 'who', 'shamelessly', 'Jax', 'ridiculously', 'sinister', 'sarcastic', 'supervisor', 'role', 'parody', 'typical', 'Bond', 'baddie', 'may', 'dislike', 'overacting', 'thought', 'added', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'scenery.This', 'ostensibly', 'prequel', 'Cube', '1', 'am', 'not', 'entirely', 'convinced', 'obvious', 'earlier', 'canon', 'suspect', 'best', 'watched', 'first', 'film']",N/A

It was nice to see a low budget flick that demanded the use of brains as well as having life or death stakes. There were genuine surprises in Cube that held up well under second and third viewings and Nicole De Boerr is, well, remarkable.Cube 2: HyperCube was pretty horrible. Slick ideas but the basic plot sucked. Assuming someone could build a hypercube, I find it a little ludicrous that, being able to screw with spacetime and quantum events, someone would then choose to torture people like that. Then the ending...without spoiling, it endangered my fairly happy view of both movies.  The first movie was good enough to equivocate my opinion of the two. Maybe it was because the first one never left the Cube. In it, you were as trapped as the poor souls inside.Now, Cube Zero comes along. Hypercube must have banked some bucks to have created demand for a continuation. Its nowhere near as good as Cube, but its certainly better than Hypercube.  For the first time, you have an explanation, however implausible, for the Cube, a detailing that there were more than one and why they were created. Not sure I bought the explanation, but at least there is one.Only one of the characters was of any interest and that is only mild. There's now both supersoldiers and bad guys (really bad). The stakes are raised by throwing a child into the mix (and then out again) and then raised yet again.That last 'raising' of the stakes is the killer. The cool thing about the Cube was the presumption that if you were smart, thought your way through, you might be able to get the hell out of there. Oh yes, it would also help if you didn't have to deal with violent co-survivors. But now in Cube Zero, they're messing with your head, your memory, your intelligence. Instead of being trapped with your basic tool kit (your head) you don't even get that.Not as much a mess as Cube 2, but if this was the first entry, I wouldn't have bothered with any more.",3,I'm a big fan of the first Cube...,1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,2044,"['Much', 'surprise', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'popped', 'up', 'Showtime', 'week.I', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'Cube', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'low', 'budget', 'flick', 'demanded', 'use', 'brains', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'life', 'death', 'stakes', 'were', 'genuine', 'surprises', 'Cube', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'second', 'third', 'viewings', 'Nicole', 'De', 'Boerr', 'well', '2', 'HyperCube', 'was', 'pretty', 'horrible', 'Slick', 'ideas', 'basic', 'plot', 'sucked', 'Assuming', 'someone', 'could', 'build', 'hypercube', 'find', 'little', 'ludicrous', 'being', 'able', 'screw', 'spacetime', 'quantum', 'events', 'someone', 'would', 'then', 'choose', 'torture', 'people', 'Then', 'ending', 'spoiling', 'endangered', 'fairly', 'happy', 'view', 'movies', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'equivocate', 'opinion', 'two', 'Maybe', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'never', 'left', 'Cube', 'were', 'as', 'trapped', 'poor', 'souls', 'inside.Now', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'along', 'Hypercube', 'must', 'have', 'banked', 'bucks', 'have', 'created', 'demand', 'continuation', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'Cube', 'certainly', 'better', 'Hypercube', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'explanation', 'however', 'implausible', 'Cube', 'detailing', 'were', 'more', 'one', 'why', 'were', 'created', 'Not', 'sure', 'bought', 'explanation', 'least', 'one.Only', 'one', 'characters', 'was', 'interest', 'only', 'mild', 'now', 'supersoldiers', 'bad', 'guys', 'really', 'bad', 'stakes', 'are', 'raised', 'throwing', 'child', 'mix', 'then', 'out', 'again', 'then', 'raised', 'yet', 'again.That', 'last', ""'raising"", 'stakes', 'killer', 'cool', 'thing', 'Cube', 'was', 'presumption', 'were', 'smart', 'thought', 'way', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'hell', 'Oh', 'yes', 'would', 'also', 'help', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'deal', 'violent', 'co-survivors', 'now', 'Cube', 'Zero', ""'re"", 'messing', 'head', 'memory', 'intelligence', 'Instead', 'being', 'trapped', 'basic', 'tool', 'kit', 'head', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'that.Not', 'as', 'much', 'mess', 'Cube', '2', 'was', 'first', 'entry', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered', 'more']",N/A

875534,ALF5OX8A6I6PY,B0006Z2LH4,"J. Barale ""Soul_Wounder""","[2, 3]","The story continues with more people stuck in a Cube-like prison, but is that all? No. We actually learn that there are workers watching the prisoners in the Cube. Until one of the workers realize that there is an innocent woman stuck in the Cube. Will he stay on the evil side or will he join the good side with the prisoners? Cube was one of the most intelligent thrillers ever made, with interesting characters, awesome gore and well crafted suspense. I gave that a 10. Cube 2 was nothing. It takes a good premise (eight strangers stuck in a hypercube) but adds this alternate universe crap, with unoriginal traps, annoying characters, insulting ending and badly done CGI. In fact, too much badly done CGI. I gave that a 3 because that are some good points. The rooms are nice and the music score is not bad, but that doesn't save the movie from becoming total trash. Cube Zero is different. It wants you to ignore Cube 2 and shows you what made the original worked; suspense, good characters, well done effects and awesome gore. There are new traps this time; Acid, wires, a flesh-eating virus, sonic weapon, freezing ice and of course, a room that vaporizes the victim. Now then, the characters are very interesting. For once, you can care for the characters now. You can even feel sad for the victims that are about to die. The main character, Eric Wynn, is awesome. Of course, he's not one of the participants, but rather one of the people who watches the Cube. He has no choice, but to rescue one of the participants of the Cube. Now I heard the character Jax was supposed to be a comedy relief. To me, he was more of a psychopath than a comedy relief, but he did had some funny moments. The direction from first-timer Ernie Barbarash (who wrote and produced Cube 2) got the tone just right. He went back to what worked in the first one and add the old, dark rusty rooms (Hey, I thought the rooms in Cube 2 was alright, but did they think that it would beat the rooms in the original?). Another thing is that instead of CGI gore, the make-up for gore effects is back. I'm glad he went back to the make-up basics instead of crappy CGI. His story was cool as well. As you can see, Ernie is the writer here. No one else, but him. I love the way he explained the Cube mythology. He should make more movies in the future because this film proved that he is a good filmmaker. Overall, I had a great time watching this. It was a fantastic effort to the Cube mythology and I hope to see more in the future. But also, I can't wait til they explain about the building of the Cube.Acting: 9/10: Zachary Bennett (Eric) does a great job as the main character with a nice touch of realism. Stephanie Moore (Rains) did a fine job here. She may not be the next Leaven, but she's still awesome to me. David Hubband (Dodd) was another winner, with his good character and a fine performance.Gore Factor: 10/10: WHOAH!!! This was gorier than 'Dawn of the Dead' and 'The Devil's Rejects' put together. Another f#cking winner.T&A;: 0/10: None, but it didn't need any.Direction: 10/10: Ernie Barbarash did a great job here with a fascinating storyline, well-crafted suspense, a few good scares and adding lots of awesome gore. I love it.Bottom Line: Fans of the first Cube, this is the movie you've been waiting for. The movie that explains it all. It may be more questions than answers, but this is what Cube is about; Mystery solving, how the Cube works. Now I know this comment may not be useful, but this is how the movie was supposed to be; a well crafted experience of the first Cube, an extremely intelligent movie instead of CGI filled crap. But you'll probably find is not useful because, obviously, you like Cube 2 more than the first and this movie. Now on to the end comment of the movie. A well done prequel that succeeds the first and ignoring the second. Bring on Cube: Trespassed.",5,One of the best films ever made.

875535,A12W99SK787ZJ9,B0006Z2LH4,"J. J. Chiappelli ""jjcx""","[6, 6]","I know I should focus only on ""Cube Zero"" in this review, but it's tough because I watched it (and most others will watch it) with some familiarity with ""Cube"" and ""Cube 2.""  So, let's get this out of the way now: ""Cube 2"" was awful.  One of the worst movies ever made.  Horrible acting, a pathetic excuse for a plot, cheap effects, and a lot of unnecessary scenes.  The Cube itself looked like the next in line of Apple products (iTorture)instead of something grisly and frightening, and the people trapped inside were paper-thin caricatures that never really amounted to anything before they died.When you watch ""Cube,"" you wonder why anybody would think a movie like that needs a sequel.  It was a wonderfully existentialist horror movie---creepy, suspenseful, and inexplicable.  It was a wonderful puzzle; you watched it for an hour and a half and then you spent weeks trying to think of your own explanations for why it happened.  The acting was (mostly) excellent and the set design was wonderful: terrifying and gritty.  The violence was kept to a minimum.  There was gore, but not a whole lot of it, which means that the focus of the movie was on the suspense, not on the gore.  (When a movie has over-the-top death scenes, it's not easy to really pay attention to the plot or characters anymore.)So now we have ""Cube Zero.""  When I began watching this, I was very worried about what kind of movie it would be.  I didn't think there should be another Cube movie, and from the cover of the DVD (and the pictures on the back), it looked like this would just be another hack 'n' slash gorefest.And for the first twenty minutes that's pretty much all it is.  Needlessly gory death scenes and a whole pile of awful, awful acting.  I was certain I would hate this movie.And then something marvelous happened---the movie began to focus on the character of Eric, the technician operating the Cube from the outside.  Suddenly, the movie became interesting because it had a plot and suspense and---best of all---GOOD acting.  The gore is toned down and doesn't become a problem, and then the story kicks into full gear and becomes a tale of repression and rebellion.This is why ""Cube Zero"" gets four stars instead of one.  Despite the fact that the leading actress does a bad job and even though there are needlessly cruel death scenes early on in the movie, Eric's story redeems the movie and makes it worth watching---whether you've seen ""Cube"" or not.  I would even say that Eric is the best character out of all of the Cube movies, and I really love the way he is tied in to the first one.  The scriptwriter does an excellent job by simply pretending that ""Cube 2"" was never made, which is a good thing.""Cube Zero"" works because it is like talking to another person about ""Cube"" and seeing his interpretation of the story instead of just hearing it.  It should be watched as a separate entity from ""Cube.""  It's not a sequel or a prequel; it's just one guy's explanation for how ""Cube"" MAY have come about.  And it's a fine story.And the ending in this one is perfect.  It gives you just the right amount of information to extrapolate and come up with your own happy ending or your own depressing ending---just like the first ""Cube.""  I thought there was no way to make a good sequel/prequel to ""Cube,"" but this movie changed my mind.One last comment---the music video on the DVD is awful.  Not only is it a bad song, it also has no place in the movie and really ruins whatever atmosphere the film creates.",4,"If anything deserves to be a sequel to Cube, this is it.",1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,3508,"['know', 'should', 'focus', 'only', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'review', 'tough', 'watched', 'most', 'others', 'will', 'watch', 'familiarity', 'Cube', 'Cube', '2', 'So', 'let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'now', 'Cube', '2', 'was', 'awful', 'One', 'worst', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Horrible', 'acting', 'pathetic', 'excuse', 'plot', 'cheap', 'effects', 'lot', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'Cube', 'looked', 'next', 'line', 'Apple', 'products', 'iTorture', 'instead', 'something', 'grisly', 'frightening', 'people', 'trapped', 'were', 'paper-thin', 'caricatures', 'never', 'really', 'amounted', 'anything', 'died.When', 'watch', 'Cube', 'wonder', 'why', 'anybody', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'sequel', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'existentialist', 'horror', 'movie', '-creepy', 'suspenseful', 'inexplicable', 'was', 'wonderful', 'puzzle', 'watched', 'hour', 'half', 'then', 'spent', 'weeks', 'trying', 'think', 'own', 'explanations', 'why', 'happened', 'acting', 'was', 'mostly', 'excellent', 'set', 'design', 'was', 'wonderful', 'terrifying', 'gritty', 'violence', 'was', 'kept', 'minimum', 'was', 'gore', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'focus', 'movie', 'was', 'suspense', 'not', 'gore', 'When', 'movie', 'over-the-top', 'death', 'scenes', 'not', 'easy', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'plot', 'characters', 'anymore', 'So', 'now', 'have', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'When', 'began', 'watching', 'was', 'very', 'worried', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'be', 'Cube', 'movie', 'cover', 'DVD', 'pictures', 'back', 'looked', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'hack', 'n', 'slash', 'gorefest.And', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'pretty', 'much', 'Needlessly', 'gory', 'death', 'scenes', 'whole', 'pile', 'awful', 'awful', 'acting', 'was', 'certain', 'would', 'hate', 'movie.And', 'then', 'something', 'marvelous', 'happened', '-the', 'movie', 'began', 'focus', 'character', 'Eric', 'technician', 'operating', 'Cube', 'outside', 'Suddenly', 'movie', 'became', 'interesting', 'had', 'plot', 'suspense', '-best', '-GOOD', 'acting', 'gore', 'toned', 'down', ""n't"", 'become', 'problem', 'then', 'story', 'full', 'gear', 'tale', 'repression', 'rebellion.This', 'why', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'fact', 'leading', 'actress', 'bad', 'job', 'even', 'are', 'needlessly', 'cruel', 'death', 'scenes', 'early', 'movie', 'Eric', 'story', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Cube', 'not', 'would', 'even', 'say', 'Eric', 'best', 'character', 'Cube', 'movies', 'really', 'love', 'way', 'tied', 'first', 'one', 'scriptwriter', 'excellent', 'job', 'simply', 'pretending', 'Cube', '2', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'good', 'thing', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'talking', 'person', 'Cube', 'seeing', 'interpretation', 'story', 'instead', 'just', 'hearing', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'separate', 'entity', 'Cube', 'not', 'sequel', 'prequel', 'just', 'one', 'guy', 'explanation', 'how', 'Cube', 'MAY', 'have', 'come', 'fine', 'story.And', 'ending', 'one', 'perfect', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'information', 'extrapolate', 'come', 'up', 'own', 'happy', 'ending', 'own', 'depressing', 'ending', '-just', 'first', 'Cube', 'thought', 'was', 'way', 'make', 'good', 'sequel/prequel', 'Cube', 'movie', 'changed', 'mind.One', 'last', 'comment', '-the', 'music', 'video', 'DVD', 'awful', 'Not', 'only', 'bad', 'song', 'also', 'place', 'movie', 'really', 'atmosphere', 'film']",N/A

875539,A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M,B0006Z2LH4,Kevin Currie-Knight,"[4, 6]","I first watched 'Cube' in 1998 and thought the film uncommonly good (particularly for a Canadian low budget film). Did I ever think it needed a sequel, let alone a prequel? No! Ater seeing thi prequel (I have no desire to see the universally panned sequel) do I NOW think a prequel was in order? Not particularly, but the film was still half-way decent.First, Cube Zero is the kind of film, like Star Wars, Episode III, that is ONLY interesting IF you care about getting answers left by the film's predocessor(s). That is, if you did not see Cube, or if you saw Cube and did not find yourself bothered by questions about the Cube's purpose, etc, then you probably will not like this film. (I DID see Cube, and while I entertained questions about the Cube's backstory, I did so casually and fleetingly. Hence, 3 stars out of 5.)Unlike Cube and Hypercube, Cube Zero takes us outside the actual cube, and into the control room, where we meet two of the Cube's employees. One, Eric, is soon to become our main character when he realizes that one of the unwitting 'players' inside the Cube does not deserve to be there. Eric decides to obey orders and enter the cube himself in order to get her out. Now, we get to see the cube from inside and out; Eric is trying to get out, and several 'executives' are trying to get to him: dead or alive.The good part about this film is that it was intelligent and captivating, just like the original. It also explains (or hints at) a decent amount of the Cube's backstory (though it does keep you guessing about a few things). Everything from what happens when a player reaches the 'exit' (the quotation marks are there for a reason, folks!) to why the character known as Kazan appeared in the original Cube film. Those who want at least some resolution to Cube will not be disappointed.That being said, let's get to the bad aspects of the film. As in the original Cube film, the script was quite bad, the acting was stiff, and the characters were unidimensional and cliche to the core.

You should know that, even if you haven't seen it. That point has been over-said enough. But what I can tell you is that Cube Zero offers a much needed breath of fresh in air in the Cube series.After Cube 2: Hypercube, I have to admit that I was alittle skeptical in renting Cube Zero. I guess I was just afraid of another rehashed version of the first one. Cube 2 just had upgraded special effects and really nothing interesting or new to add to the idea. Cube Zero succeeds in everything Cube 2 failed at.Cube Zero offers a really interesting storyline that takes you outside the Cube (but not too far) and into the minds of two technicians that watch and monitor people inside the cube. After so long, one of them is eaten up by the guilt and all the unanswerable questions surrounding the cube, and decides to venture inside the cube himself to try and help out the surviving people inside.What I liked about the story to Cube Zero was that it gaves us some much needed answers surrounding its purpose and where it came from, but does it in such a way that it doesn't take away from any of the mystery or eeriness that the original film did for it. Even after everything that Cube Zero explains, I can still watch Cube and be just as satisified with it. Cube Zero ruins nothing that the original film did. Plus, the ending to the film is just great, as it explains something from the first film that intrigued me for so many years.In addition to all that, if your a gore fan Cube Zero is probably the goriest Cube film, and its death sequences with the traps are just spectacular and original. And the acting is plausible.In ending, Cube Zero is definitely worth seeing for any Cube fan that was disappointed with Cube 2.",4,A success in the Cube series,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,1818,"['Okay', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'tell', 'prequel', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'original', 'should', 'know', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'point', 'been', 'over-said', 'enough', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'much', 'needed', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'Cube', 'series.After', 'Cube', '2', 'Hypercube', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'alittle', 'skeptical', 'renting', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'guess', 'was', 'just', 'afraid', 'rehashed', 'version', 'first', 'one', 'Cube', '2', 'just', 'had', 'upgraded', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'new', 'add', 'idea', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'everything', 'Cube', '2', 'failed', 'at.Cube', 'Zero', 'really', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'Cube', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'minds', 'two', 'technicians', 'watch', 'monitor', 'people', 'cube', 'so', 'long', 'one', 'eaten', 'up', 'guilt', 'unanswerable', 'questions', 'surrounding', 'cube', 'venture', 'cube', 'try', 'help', 'out', 'surviving', 'people', 'liked', 'story', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'was', 'much', 'needed', 'answers', 'surrounding', 'purpose', 'where', 'came', 'way', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'mystery', 'eeriness', 'original', 'film', 'did', 'Even', 'everything', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'can', 'still', 'watch', 'Cube', 'be', 'just', 'satisified', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'nothing', 'original', 'film', 'did', 'ending', 'film', 'just', 'great', 'something', 'first', 'film', 'intrigued', 'so', 'many', 'years.In', 'addition', 'gore', 'fan', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'probably', 'goriest', 'Cube', 'film', 'death', 'sequences', 'traps', 'are', 'just', 'spectacular', 'original', 'acting', 'plausible.In', 'ending', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Cube', 'fan', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Cube', '2']",N/A
875543,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006Z2LH4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[43, 44]","In the beginning there was ""Cube,"" and it had a memorable opening in which a man enters a cube and is sliced into mini-cubes by razor wire, and it definitely caught the attention of those who watched it.  As the movie continued we followed a group of people as they tried to figure out why they where there, what was happening, and how they could get out of there alive given that some of the cubes were verily dangerous.  And the film ended with the mystery unresolved and the people applauded and thought that it was a fairly provocative and effective little horror film.  Then the money lenders in Hollywood decided they there might be riches to be made from doing a bigger and better version of the ""Cube,"" and lo, they produced ""Cube 2: Hypercube.""  But the people were not fooled and they realized that the sequel had little to do with the original beyond the fact that well, there are a whole bunch of cubes.  And the sound of lamentation was loud, with much gnashing of teeth and rending of garments, and the people prayed that if there was another film in this series that they would go back to what made the original film so good.  Then the money lenders laughed in the temples of their offices and said to each other, ""Come, let us do what they ask, but in a way that will make them regret that they did not lavish more money upon the sequel that we have made.""The title ""Cube Zero"" is enough to indicate that writer-director Ernie Barbarash, who scripted ""Cube Two: Hypercube,"" is going back to the start.  But to reassure the audience that this film is an attempt to get back to at least the spirit of the original you once again get an opening scene in which somebody enters a cube and they die a horrible death.  In fact, it is an even more gruesome death than what we say in ""Cube,"" mainly because the victim lives after the very bad thing happens to him.  The cubes this time around are about as primitive compared to the orignal cubes as the hypercubes were more advanced.  As soon as you are see these cubes you have to be thinking ""prequel,"" strictly on the basis of the obvious disparity in the technological level (think submarine hatches).  But as was the case with ""Cube 2,"" there is really nothing concrete in ""Cube Zero"" to convince us that this film is connected to the original ""Cube"" beyond that basic idea that they involve a deadly game involved with cubes (this would be the same as saying ""Any Given Sunday,"" ""Friday Night Lights,"" and ""The Longest Yard"" are all football movies, and the game is the same, but they are not part of a trilogy).However, despite the promising start (there are people who will stop watching the film because they are not going to want to see anything worse than what happens in the first couple of minutes), ""Cube Zero"" has a serious flaw.  Whereas ""Cube"" left us completely in the dark as the figure disappeared into the bright light and ""Cube 2: Hypercube"" had a final scene where we get to look behind the curtain for a few hints as to what is going on, ""Cube Zero"" decides early on to let us go outside the cube and find out what is going on (or at least more clues along those lines).  That means the success of this film depends on how much the audience buys into and likes the ""big secret,"" and in that regard ""Cube Zero"" does not fare as well as ""The Village"" (and we all know how vilified that film was by fans and critics).  After all, the whole plot line regarding what is happening outside the cubes does not solve the mystery of the original ""Cube,"" which it cannot fairly do since it is a different director and writer, any more than somebody could make a ""Pulp Fiction"" sequel and explain what is in the briefcase.Those of us who liked ""Cube"" will find ""Cube Zero"" an improvement over ""Cube 2"" but not up to the standard of the original, but we pretty much knew we would come to that conclusion going into this 2004 film.  Once again we have a group of desperate people trying to make their way out of the cubes, and the fact that this time there are not individuals who have necessary skills that can work in combination to save them gives away that the body count will be higher this time around.  Being able to watch the watchers takes away some enjoyment as well, because it was always easier to watch the mice in the maze and critique their endeavors than it was to put yourself in their position.  By the time the one-eyed Willie Wonka figure shows up in this movie you are pretty much committed to going along for the ride, but not exactly enthralled.  Maybe there will be a fourth movie in this series, because it could end up being another one of those Hollywood puzzle boxes, like in ""Hellraiser,"" where they just keep making these movies until they finally get it right.",3,"A prequel to ""Cube"" that still makes the original look good",1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,4758,"['beginning', 'there', 'was', 'Cube', 'had', 'memorable', 'opening', 'man', 'cube', 'sliced', 'mini-cubes', 'razor', 'wire', 'definitely', 'caught', 'attention', 'who', 'watched', 'movie', 'continued', 'followed', 'group', 'people', 'tried', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'where', 'there', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'how', 'could', 'get', 'alive', 'given', 'cubes', 'were', 'verily', 'dangerous', 'film', 'ended', 'mystery', 'unresolved', 'people', 'applauded', 'thought', 'was', 'fairly', 'provocative', 'effective', 'little', 'horror', 'film', 'Then', 'money', 'lenders', 'Hollywood', 'decided', 'might', 'be', 'riches', 'be', 'made', 'doing', 'bigger', 'better', 'version', 'Cube', 'lo', 'produced', 'Cube', '2', 'Hypercube', 'people', 'were', 'not', 'fooled', 'realized', 'sequel', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'original', 'fact', 'well', 'are', 'whole', 'bunch', 'cubes', 'sound', 'lamentation', 'was', 'loud', 'much', 'gnashing', 'teeth', 'rending', 'garments', 'people', 'prayed', 'was', 'film', 'series', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'what', 'made', 'original', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'Then', 'money', 'lenders', 'laughed', 'temples', 'offices', 'said', 'other', 'Come', 'let', 'do', 'what', 'ask', 'way', 'will', 'make', 'regret', 'did', 'not', 'lavish', 'more', 'money', 'sequel', 'have', 'made', 'title', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'enough', 'indicate', 'writer-director', 'Ernie', 'Barbarash', 'who', 'scripted', 'Cube', 'Two', 'Hypercube', 'going', 'back', 'start', 'reassure', 'audience', 'film', 'attempt', 'get', 'back', 'least', 'spirit', 'original', 'once', 'again', 'get', 'opening', 'scene', 'somebody', 'cube', 'die', 'horrible', 'death', 'fact', 'even', 'more', 'gruesome', 'death', 'what', 'say', 'Cube', 'mainly', 'victim', 'very', 'bad', 'thing', 'happens', 'cubes', 'time', 'around', 'are', 'primitive', 'compared', 'orignal', 'cubes', 'hypercubes', 'were', 'more', 'advanced', 'As', 'soon', 'are', 'see', 'cubes', 'have', 'be', 'thinking', 'prequel', 'strictly', 'basis', 'obvious', 'disparity', 'technological', 'level', 'think', 'submarine', 'hatches', 'was', 'case', 'Cube', '2', 'really', 'nothing', 'concrete', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'convince', 'film', 'connected', 'original', 'Cube', 'basic', 'idea', 'involve', 'deadly', 'game', 'involved', 'cubes', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'saying', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'are', 'football', 'movies', 'game', 'same', 'are', 'not', 'part', 'trilogy', '.However', 'promising', 'start', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'watching', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'want', 'see', 'anything', 'worse', 'what', 'first', 'couple', 'minutes', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'serious', 'flaw', 'Cube', 'left', 'completely', 'dark', 'figure', 'disappeared', 'bright', 'light', 'Cube', '2', 'Hypercube', 'had', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'get', 'look', 'curtain', 'few', 'hints', 'what', 'going', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'early', 'let', 'go', 'cube', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'least', 'more', 'clues', 'lines', 'success', 'film', 'how', 'much', 'audience', 'big', 'secret', 'regard', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'not', 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'Village', 'know', 'how', 'vilified', 'film', 'was', 'fans', 'critics', 'whole', 'plot', 'line', 'regarding', 'what', 'happening', 'cubes', 'not', 'solve', 'mystery', 'original', 'Cube', 'can', 'not', 'fairly', 'do', 'different', 'director', 'writer', 'more', 'somebody', 'could', 'make', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'sequel', 'explain', 'what', 'briefcase.Those', 'who', 'liked', 'Cube', 'will', 'find', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'improvement', 'Cube', '2', 'not', 'standard', 'original', 'pretty', 'much', 'would', 'come', 'conclusion', 'going', '2004', 'film', 'Once', 'again', 'have', 'group', 'desperate', 'people', 'trying', 'make', 'way', 'cubes', 'fact', 'time', 'are', 'not', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'necessary', 'skills', 'can', 'work', 'combination', 'save', 'away', 'body', 'count', 'will', 'be', 'higher', 'time', 'around', 'Being', 'able', 'watch', 'watchers', 'away', 'enjoyment', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'always', 'easier', 'watch', 'mice', 'maze', 'critique', 'endeavors', 'was', 'put', 'position', 'time', 'one-eyed', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'figure', 'up', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'committed', 'going', 'along', 'ride', 'not', 'exactly', 'enthralled', 'Maybe', 'will', 'be', 'fourth', 'movie', 'series', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'puzzle', 'boxes', 'Hellraiser', 'where', 'just', 'keep', 'making', 'movies', 'finally', 'get', 'right']",N/A
875544,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B0006Z2LH4,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[3, 3]","I find myself experiencing two schools of thought when it comes to the CUBE series. On the one hand, they are all poorly acted, with mostly redundant plots and predictable dialogue. On the other hand, their structures are so blatantly philosophical, so unabashadly symbolic, it's kind of a treat to sit back and fiddle with the concepts it represents. Sorta the same way you'd fill in a few of the boxes on a crossword puzzle you know you're never going to finish. It's addictive like that; a plate of cheese that people talk around even as they pick it apart.And if you're wondering if these plates have the kind of cheese you like, then this review is for you.Cube- People wake up in a labyrinthine cube with no idea of how they got there or why they've been kidnapped. They must navigate through a series of deadly traps, without knowing just what it is they're headed for (or even where it is). A doctor, a famous escapist, a cop, a mentally handicapped fella -- personalities clash, and what could've been a tight little parable of existentialism becomes a squabbling social commentary about the brutality of big, mean men. It's tense, but not paced particularly well, although the ending has a thankful spot of hope. Like the Rubik's Cube, most people will find this cube compelling for a few twists and turns, but are unlikely to find the ending all that rewarding. 3 1/2 stars.Cube 2 - Hypercube- The cube has gone hyper! Dimensional that is. Gone is the first cube's relentless dankness, replaced here by sterile, unapologetic white. Although the new cube is also fraught with hidden perils, these are mostly of the multidimensional variety. What this means for you, the viewer, is that the traps are now CGI contraptions that look not convincing in the least. It also means that many rooms have their own gravity and ""variable time speeds."" Oh, I almost forgot, the most awesome thing it means is that it exists in multiple dimensions at once, so there are apparently about fifteen different copies of each person wandering around at the same time.Did I say ""awesome""? I'm sorry. I meant ""unfortunate."" Because this cube has basically no rules, virtually anything can happen, making what DOES happen less important in the long run. We've got some crazy characters -- a senile physicist, a blind girl, a private detective, a video game desinger and a lawyer -- and they all have connections with a scary-big corporation named Izon, but who cares? The least plot driven of the three movies, this film is also the darkest (in spite of how well-lit each frame is). And, of course, it succumbs to the same mistake as the first film. Instead of being about the little people coming to terms with the bizarre futility of their circumstances, it devolves into a big man going crazy and chasing everyone around with a knife. 2 stars.CUBE ZERO - I don't know why they called this CUBE ZERO instead of CUBE CUBED. Maybe it's supposed to be a prequel, but I doubt it. It's possible they just thought ""zero"" sounded better than ""three."" Or maybe it's because, for the first time ever, the viewer is treated to life outside of the cube.Don't worry. The cube is still there, just as gloomy and lethal as ever (and in far more vividly gross ways), but the group of people inside the box are at least as important as the people watching them. The watchers in this case are a couple of be-jumpsuited guys named Wynn and Dodd who sit around, play chess, and record people's dreams. These guys give the series a chance to do some more overt navel-gazing, but the end effect isn't that bad, even if it mostly just feels like a Pinter play. Specifically, THE DUMBWAITER. (Read it. It's good.)Still, no matter how full of dread and terror his plays were, Pinter always kept the terrible and dreaded things off-stage. When Wynn begins to question his duties, eventually taking drastic measures to get some answers, he causes chaos in and out of the cube. Enter three of the dreaded higher-ups. An effete and over-acted character named Jax pops in, followed closely by two well-groomed go-fers. (Everytime Jax talked to them, I could swear he was calling them Thin and Quickly, but the credits list them as Finn and Quigley.) They are heralded with whimsically creepy violin music, like an incidental theme song, and although they aren't fooling around, their presence makes the whole thing far less ominous than it normally would.Still, the wackiness they provde is menacing and self-assured, and it disguises a story with far more heart and smarts than its predecessors. Even if the story contains, yet again, a big, angry man chasing people around, that is a minor part of the much larger, much more hopeful picture. Satisfying in a lot of ways, this film also pays homage to fans who've endured the films from the beginning. 4 stars",4,Cube Cubed,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,4821,"['find', 'experiencing', 'two', 'schools', 'thought', 'when', 'CUBE', 'series', 'one', 'hand', 'are', 'poorly', 'acted', 'mostly', 'redundant', 'plots', 'predictable', 'dialogue', 'other', 'hand', 'structures', 'are', 'so', 'blatantly', 'philosophical', 'so', 'unabashadly', 'symbolic', 'kind', 'treat', 'sit', 'back', 'fiddle', 'concepts', 'Sorta', 'same', 'way', ""'d"", 'fill', 'few', 'boxes', 'crossword', 'puzzle', 'know', ""'re"", 'never', 'going', 'finish', 'addictive', 'plate', 'cheese', 'people', 'talk', 'around', 'even', 'pick', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'plates', 'have', 'kind', 'cheese', 'then', 'review', 'you.Cube-', 'People', 'wake', 'up', 'labyrinthine', 'cube', 'idea', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'why', ""'ve"", 'been', 'kidnapped', 'must', 'navigate', 'series', 'deadly', 'traps', 'knowing', 'just', 'what', ""'re"", 'headed', 'even', 'where', 'doctor', 'famous', 'escapist', 'cop', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'fella', 'personalities', 'clash', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tight', 'little', 'parable', 'existentialism', 'squabbling', 'social', 'commentary', 'brutality', 'big', 'mean', 'men', 'tense', 'not', 'paced', 'particularly', 'well', 'ending', 'thankful', 'spot', 'hope', 'Rubik', 'Cube', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'cube', 'compelling', 'few', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'unlikely', 'find', 'ending', 'rewarding', '3', '1/2', 'stars.Cube', '2', 'Hypercube-', 'cube', 'gone', 'hyper', 'Dimensional', 'Gone', 'first', 'cube', 'relentless', 'dankness', 'replaced', 'here', 'sterile', 'unapologetic', 'white', 'new', 'cube', 'also', 'fraught', 'hidden', 'perils', 'are', 'mostly', 'multidimensional', 'variety', 'What', 'viewer', 'traps', 'are', 'now', 'CGI', 'contraptions', 'look', 'not', 'convincing', 'least', 'also', 'many', 'rooms', 'have', 'own', 'gravity', 'variable', 'time', 'speeds', 'Oh', 'almost', 'forgot', 'most', 'awesome', 'thing', 'multiple', 'dimensions', 'once', 'are', 'apparently', 'fifteen', 'different', 'copies', 'person', 'wandering', 'around', 'same', 'time.Did', 'say', 'awesome', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'meant', 'unfortunate', 'cube', 'basically', 'rules', 'virtually', 'anything', 'can', 'happen', 'making', 'what', 'DOES', 'happen', 'less', 'important', 'long', 'run', ""'ve"", 'got', 'crazy', 'characters', 'senile', 'physicist', 'blind', 'girl', 'private', 'detective', 'video', 'game', 'desinger', 'lawyer', 'have', 'connections', 'scary-big', 'corporation', 'named', 'Izon', 'who', 'least', 'plot', 'driven', 'three', 'movies', 'film', 'also', 'darkest', 'spite', 'how', 'well-lit', 'frame', 'course', 'same', 'mistake', 'first', 'film', 'Instead', 'being', 'little', 'people', 'coming', 'terms', 'bizarre', 'futility', 'circumstances', 'big', 'man', 'going', 'crazy', 'chasing', 'everyone', 'knife', '2', 'stars.CUBE', 'ZERO', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'called', 'CUBE', 'ZERO', 'instead', 'CUBE', 'CUBED', 'Maybe', 'supposed', 'be', 'prequel', 'doubt', 'possible', 'just', 'thought', 'zero', 'sounded', 'better', 'three', 'maybe', 'because', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'viewer', 'treated', 'life', 'cube.Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'cube', 'still', 'there', 'just', 'gloomy', 'lethal', 'ever', 'far', 'more', 'vividly', 'gross', 'ways', 'group', 'people', 'box', 'are', 'least', 'as', 'important', 'people', 'watching', 'watchers', 'case', 'are', 'couple', 'be-jumpsuited', 'guys', 'named', 'Wynn', 'Dodd', 'who', 'sit', 'around', 'play', 'chess', 'record', 'people', 'dreams', 'guys', 'give', 'series', 'chance', 'do', 'more', 'overt', 'navel-gazing', 'end', 'effect', ""n't"", 'bad', 'even', 'mostly', 'just', 'feels', 'Pinter', 'play', 'Specifically', 'DUMBWAITER', 'Read', 'good', 'Still', 'matter', 'how', 'full', 'dread', 'terror', 'plays', 'were', 'Pinter', 'always', 'kept', 'terrible', 'dreaded', 'things', 'off-stage', 'When', 'Wynn', 'question', 'duties', 'eventually', 'taking', 'drastic', 'measures', 'get', 'answers', 'chaos', 'cube', 'Enter', 'three', 'dreaded', 'higher-ups', 'effete', 'over-acted', 'character', 'named', 'Jax', 'pops', 'followed', 'closely', 'two', 'well-groomed', 'go-fers', 'Everytime', 'Jax', 'talked', 'could', 'swear', 'was', 'calling', 'Thin', 'Quickly', 'credits', 'list', 'Finn', 'Quigley', 'are', 'heralded', 'whimsically', 'creepy', 'violin', 'music', 'incidental', 'theme', 'song', 'are', ""n't"", 'fooling', 'around', 'presence', 'whole', 'thing', 'far', 'less', 'ominous', 'normally', 'would.Still', 'wackiness', 'provde', 'menacing', 'self-assured', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'heart', 'smarts', 'predecessors', 'Even', 'story', 'contains', 'yet', 'again', 'big', 'angry', 'man', 'chasing', 'people', 'minor', 'part', 'much', 'larger', 'much', 'more', 'hopeful', 'picture', 'Satisfying', 'lot', 'ways', 'film', 'also', 'homage', 'fans', 'who', ""'ve"", 'endured', 'films', 'beginning', '4', 'stars']",N/A

875546,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B0006Z2LH4,Matthew King,"[6, 8]","""Cube Zero"" is the second sequel to the 1997 Canadian indie horror hit ""Cube"".  The concept in Cube was that a group of strangers were trapped in a never-ending maze of cubes, many of them rigged with lethal traps.  They had no idea how they got there, they just knew they desperately needed to get out.  It was a very low-budget affair that worked well due to strong acting, interesting philosophical concepts and an original idea.  The year 2002 saw the release of Cube2:Hypercube, a decent film that nevertheless succumbed to the law of diminishing returns that are sequels.  While entertaining, it offered nothing new and was basically a rehash of the original.""Cube Zero"" finally tries something different, as it gives us a look at the people ""behind the cube"", those who push the trap buttons and those who are the brains behind the operation.  We meet a couple of guys whose job it is to monitor the people inside the cube and to push certain buttons when ordered to do so by their superiors, whom they have never met or seen.  Eventually, one of the two guys becomes obsessed with a woman trapped inside and enters the cube himself in an attempt to rescue her.Although still very much a b-movie, there's a decidedly superior production quality, higher budget, and more special effects this time around.  It looks way slicker than any of the previous two cube movies.  That being said, it did lack the charming indie vibe of the original.  What made the original so good were the characters, how each of them had a special strength and the interesting conversations they had.  In this entry aside from the two ""Cube Workers"" the characters feel flat and underdeveloped.This ""Cube"" finally sheds some light on fundamental questions that were previously unexplained in the other two movies such as who is behind the cube, why the people are inside in the first place, what they did wrong that got them in there, etc.  Every few minutes something interesting is revealed about the origins of the Cube and that is one of the main reasons it kept me on the edge of my seat.  As for the action inside the cube, nothing very original this time, much of the same types of traps and rooms, although the gore scenes were quite creative and very graphic. I must say that I was quite impressed with Cube Zero.  Does it give us all the answers?  No, but it does give us a whole lot, more than any of the previous two entries combined.",4,Corporate lords of the cube,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,2428,"['Cube', 'Zero', 'second', 'sequel', '1997', 'Canadian', 'indie', 'horror', 'hit', 'Cube', 'concept', 'Cube', 'was', 'group', 'strangers', 'were', 'trapped', 'never-ending', 'maze', 'cubes', 'many', 'rigged', 'lethal', 'traps', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'just', 'knew', 'desperately', 'needed', 'get', 'out', 'was', 'very', 'low-budget', 'affair', 'worked', 'well', 'due', 'strong', 'acting', 'interesting', 'philosophical', 'concepts', 'original', 'idea', 'year', '2002', 'saw', 'release', 'Cube2', 'Hypercube', 'decent', 'film', 'nevertheless', 'succumbed', 'law', 'diminishing', 'returns', 'are', 'sequels', 'entertaining', 'offered', 'nothing', 'new', 'was', 'basically', 'rehash', 'original', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'finally', 'something', 'different', 'look', 'people', 'cube', 'who', 'push', 'trap', 'buttons', 'who', 'are', 'brains', 'operation', 'meet', 'couple', 'guys', 'job', 'monitor', 'people', 'cube', 'push', 'certain', 'buttons', 'when', 'ordered', 'do', 'so', 'superiors', 'whom', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'seen', 'Eventually', 'one', 'two', 'guys', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'woman', 'trapped', 'cube', 'attempt', 'rescue', 'her.Although', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'b-movie', 'decidedly', 'superior', 'production', 'quality', 'higher', 'budget', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'time', 'around', 'way', 'slicker', 'previous', 'two', 'cube', 'movies', 'being', 'said', 'did', 'lack', 'charming', 'indie', 'vibe', 'original', 'What', 'made', 'original', 'so', 'good', 'were', 'characters', 'how', 'had', 'special', 'strength', 'interesting', 'conversations', 'had', 'entry', 'aside', 'two', 'Cube', 'Workers', 'characters', 'feel', 'flat', 'underdeveloped.This', 'Cube', 'finally', 'light', 'fundamental', 'questions', 'were', 'previously', 'unexplained', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'such', 'who', 'cube', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'inside', 'first', 'place', 'what', 'did', 'wrong', 'got', 'there', 'etc', 'Every', 'few', 'minutes', 'something', 'interesting', 'revealed', 'origins', 'Cube', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'action', 'cube', 'nothing', 'very', 'original', 'time', 'much', 'same', 'types', 'traps', 'rooms', 'gore', 'scenes', 'were', 'quite', 'creative', 'very', 'graphic', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'give', 'answers', 'No', 'give', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'previous', 'two', 'entries', 'combined']",N/A

I suppose it could be written off as a taught, tense slasher film depicting a sadistic police state in our near future. Or is it an allegory for something else?Perhaps because I had no preconceptions from the earlier films I saw something else. The Cube is an allegory for earthly existance. The first tip was the wiping of memory before being placed in the great sadistic puzzle. Is not our memory of previous existance wiped clean before our incarnation in flesh on earth? Take a look at the nature of the Cube as a series of arduous, painful, even fatal traps that the inmates struggle through. Those that survive do so through teamwork and concern for their fellows. Heroic sacrifice and risk taking is generally rewarded. It is those who show little or no concern for their fellows who meet bad ends. Even the ""techs"" correspond to those individuals who think that by serving the evil, sadistic powers-that-be that they will be rewarded and protected- when the truth is that they are merely tolerated as long as they are useful- afterwhich they will be fed to the Cube themselves. As for the masters- they are clearly demonic and take great pleasure from their job of running the Cube. They are the Princes of the Earth- masters of the great machine of trial by suffering and hard choices. Yet, they are also capable of breaking the rules- until an even higher power calls them to task.Finally, what is the last answer to be given if one makes it to the Exit? It is, ""Do you believe in God?""As for the ending, I won't reveal it.

It possessed stylish deaths, an amazing idea, living up to its reputation and ambition. The third flick decided to further explore the source of the ' cube', trying to attempt a back story that made sense. Personally I think that when the first one was made, they were leaving it as an unknown to have it creepier, but likely didn't have an idea in hand since it wouldn't be used. Now, to make another movie, they had to rack their brains and come up with something.It works in some ways and in others it doesn't. It's a plausible explanation, but carried out at times with a goofy execution. What is up with the droid intelligence men? I didn't get into the whole 'man upstair' kind of thing when they came down. It was cool in a way when they were unseen. They basically did an admirable job in creating something that makes some sort of sense, but I prefer more people in the maze stuff.The acting was better than the first films, but I never got to care about the characters the same. The only one I really felt affection for was the lead Zachary Bennett. He convinced me to care about him and be on his side. His lady crush, Cassandra, played by Stephanie Moore, conveyed fear and anguish well. All others did their part but these are the two that stood out to me the most.Gore is painted on thicker, and we still get the classic death scenes. Again we see another man vs. wire, but the originals was a bit better. The acid scene here is a lot more vicious though, starting the movie off with a hellish note. Nasty! The directing by Ernie Barbarash is ambitious and the score works, even if it is a little lackluster.Overall definitely not as good as the first. It tries too hard to explain itself and I didn't sense any of the paranoia and claustrophobia I did in the first. The most I felt was suspense in the 'back room'. The acting improved but the characters weren't as likeable, save one. Rent the first and if you like it, you'll probably enjoy this one as well.One problem that bugs me is that I don't see how it can really be a prequel. The cube here seems more advanced than in the original. If in this movie they applied acid to the letters to keep them from figuring it out, what about in part one's situation? It showed all the cube blocks getting marred from the stuff. Also, I wasn't sure if the ending was to imply the man (can't give away more than this) was the same from the first film.

875555,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0006Z2LH4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 3]","Cube Zero (Ernie Barbarash, 2004)NOTE: this review contains a really, really major spoiler. If you're planning on watching the movie, be warned.Cube Zero is a movie so unspeakably horrible, so ineffably awful, so utterly insincere to the mythology around which it is based that it breaks through the ceiling of the thoroughly awful and may even come to inhabit that special place that one holds dear in one's heart for films so bad you can't help but feel affection for them-- Night of the Lepus, for example, or Gymkata.While it's impossible to believe that a movie this inept could have possibly come from anyone even remotely involved with the Cube franchise, it's true: writer/director Ernie Barbarash wrote and produced Cube 2: Hypercube. This is his first (and, if there is any justice in the world, it will be his last) directorial effort, and he comes off as the Jamaican Bobsled Team of directors; he may perform something else behind the scenes of a movie reasonably well, but the man should never be allowed near a directors' chair again. Ever. To expand on his own talent, Barbarash recruited a production team so skilled that he might have had to dole out minimum wage (for the rest of us, not Hollywood) to the whole lot of them. But maybe they all took one paycheck and just split it. For with the exception of makeup wiz Scott Hamilton (I, Robot), unless Barbarash's utter lack of talent simply eclipsed anything else, no one on this crew is worth a thing. ""Shoddy"" doesn't even begin to describe it. The set design was conceived by a rabid wombat (who, I might add, had obviously never seen either of the first two films), the dialogue was written by a drunk sloth, and the costumes were rented from the local dry cleaner, who I'm sure promised they could have them for free as long as they were back by nine the next morning.The worst travesty, however, is in the casting. (I warned you about a spoiler. I will do so again. If you haven't seen the movie, and you plan to, skip the rest of this paragraph.) The box lets you know it's a prequel. What they don't tell you is that in order to preserve the suspense-- or, more likely, simply because some asinine copywriter forgot to do any fact-checking-- they changed some names around. Why I prefer the second interpretation in the last sentence to the first: when they recreate a key scene from the first movie, the actors portraying the characters in the first movie not only don't look like their first-movie counterparts, they couldn't possibly be more different. While that may have been intentional, it comes off ludicrous at best. The production team were either insulting our intelligence as viewers, or trumpeting their own stupidity ot the high heavens. More probably, they were doing both.So given all that, what could I have possibly liked about the movie?, you may be asking. And you'd be right. First, the dialogue and situations are so insipid they often inspire unintentional hilarity. The ""exit procedures"" scene is one of the funniest I've seen in a movie in quite a while. It's always fun playing ""spot the inconsistency"" in a film based around a popular mythology.

The more Cube movies they try to make, the more I begin to believe that Cube was a one-trick-pony that has already had its day in the sun.Cube Zero is a supposed prequel to the happenings in the original Cube, showing us the observers of the victims trapped inside the cube.  One of the observers, Eric (Zachary Bennett) suddenly develops a conscious when he discovers that one of the victims is inside the cube involuntarily.  Naturally, since she is a pretty woman and a mother, Eric decides to enter the cube and rescue her.That's about all there is to the plot.  The dialogue is weak, stilted, and a bit repetitive, but the traps are numerous and cool.  If your only complaint with Hypercube was the lack of traps then you will like Cube Zero much better, but there is no study of human nature in this prequel as there was in the original, the one point that made Cube fascinating outside of the gory messes the traps left behind.My recommendation is to pick up the original Cube first, to see the best version first and to get an idea of the plot behind putting people inside the Cube, and what the Cube really is.  Then watch Hypercube and Cube Zero to judge for yourself.  My opinion, Cube is a 'Buy', Hypercube and Cube Zero are 'Rents'.

875558,A3863M2049OPN3,B0006Z2LH4,The Bus,"[4, 6]","I have not seen CUBE 1, but have seen CUBE 2. I thought Hypercube was ok, but not very good. CUBE:ZERO however, is everything that Hypercube was not.I won't bother with too much of a detailed synposis. Same story, people wake up in the CUBE, not knowing how they got there. The difference in this story from the previous one is that in CUBE ZERO, they also seem to have also lost their memory of who they were before the CUBE also. The CUBE is just that, a CUBE shaped room with doors on all six sides that lead to other CUBE rooms. The only catch, some of the rooms are death traps. And not nice death traps either, very gruesome traps. The rooms can move around also!The story half involves the people in the CUBE, just as in the previous CUBE's. However, the other half of the story, the more interesting part, is the story of a guy who's outside the CUBE who is actually an operator of the CUBE. He starts to ask too many questions, and figures out that all is not what it seems.First off, the CUBE is SO MUCH COOLER! It's much more colder, mechanical, realistic, then the hypercube. Even though the rooms are identical, they are illuminated in different colors, which helped break up the same-ness of all the rooms.The traps in CUBE:ZERO were so much more gruesome and realistic then the terrible completely fakey computer generated traps in the Hypercube.There is something to be said about not revealing too much or explaining too much in a movie, because your own imagination can be so much more creative. CUBE:ZERO doesn't reveal too much, but reveals just enough of what's going on. They talk about the how and the what, they don't really explain the why though, and that's fine, because that's up to you to explain. People who were frustrated with the whole ""you only think it's cool cause it doesn't make any sense"" thing will be much happier with CUBE : ZERO. It makes just enough sense, but not too much sense!Once again, like Hypercube, this is NOT a horror movie. It's a sci-fi movie that is reminiscient of a outer limits / twighlight zone / X-files type of story. Sure, there's some horror elements in it, and it's much more of a horror-type story then hypercube, but it's still not a horrow movie. I'd say it's very close to like Hellraiser 2 as far as some of the ways that people get killed. But it's definitely a dark sci-fi movie. Similar in darkness to ""Dark City"", however, with blood and gore. In fact, those who have seen Dark City will probably raise an eyebrow or two when they reveal the names of a couple of the ""suits"" who come down from ""upstairs"".I have not seen CUBE, but I plan to see it the very next time it's available to rent. I have seen Hypercube though, and I have to say that CUBE ZERO is a THOUSAND times better than Hypercube. In Hypercube, you want to know what's going on, and find out what happens, but you could give a darn who died and how. The characters were so unlikeable that their deaths were meaningless. But in CUBE ZERO, you actually feel sorry for the people trapped in the cube, for the most part, and hope that they find a way out.The set, the special effects, are a thousand times better than Hypercube. In fact, it's so much more better, that the titles Hypercube and CUBE ZERO should not even be uttered in the same breath. CUBE ZERO was all that I hoped it could be. This was a movie that I could have easily watched in a movie theater. The only thing I really hated about it was that the end is left wide open, with just as many new questions to be asked, as were answered in the movie.Update:Since I originally wrote this, I actually got to see CUBE 1. After seeing it, I now know why people thought the original CUBE was so great. However, I don't think it's so much more better than CUBE : ZERO.I think that there are some things in CUBE that are better than CZ, and I think that CZ has a few things that are better than CUBE. They really compliment each other. CZ is supposed to be a pre-quel to CUBE, so I thought it EXTRA COOL that the very last seen in CZ was the very first seen in CUBE. It really tied them together. I think anybody who enjoyed the original CUBE will love CZ, and the other way around also.Whatever you do though, if you haven't yet seen Hypercube, DON'T! It is REALLY REALLY BAD.CUBE and CZ go hand in hand. It's as if one was made right after the other.

The company that controls the Cube is a tightlipped operation, feeding the thing and keeping it going and recording all the stuff. Two men wathc it, too, and two men are asked simply to observe. This seems fine at first but it soon becomes an issue, and the issue is - simply - feeling pangs of remorse. This leads power some odd roads, shows off the Cube in odd ways, and segways into the new movie. It also says something on the game, the gamers, and some of what is transpiring.As far as The Cube franchise goes, I really liked it. i liked Cube and I thought Hypercube worked, and this prequel is also a nice entry onto the Cube stage. It has some nice ideas and some nice acting and a scale that makes the first movie seem like it is advancing. Place all the movies into that order and, boom, you have an evolving idea.along with this, you also have a rating that might be odd. As a movie itself the movie would score lower than a chain movie, with Cube and its sequels not exactly rating the same as Cube versus another title. It would be like comparing Friday the 13th movies. you do those andrank them so why not these?In this, you have some stuff that is explain but not too much to overwhelm. You also find out about Mr. Prime Numbers in this one, seeing how he got into the first movie as a subject. Also seen are some shades of the way the outside was seen to work, the way the world is, and the secret here. Basically, the Cube eats its young, taking down everything in its path. We knew that before and this says that we do it now. you simply don't ask and you don't get told the answer you dread.It has a rustic look but not a bad one and the traps are back. The Hypercube hurt a little of that with the way it was set, but the new movie makes up for that with older types of torment. also here are the staples that were in the first movie, with teams of people working through. As a Cube movie I would round to 5. As a movie, round to 4.Its all what you want. you haven't seen the Cube, do not see this. It will ruin some stuff. See them and see if you like them, providing you give this a chance and realize the budget. I liked it but I like movies like this but I can still say that it isn't bad. Sequels already suffer - it could have had some bad turns that it didn't take and the good stuff makes up for everything else.3.6 - 4. Not a lot of extras - all Cube movies are like that.thank you.",4,Prime Numbers and More! -Starting over,1297036800,"02 7, 2011",2011,2517,"['Ever', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'thngs', 'begin', 'Well', 'be', 'careful', 'not', 'make', 'participant', 'game', 'company', 'Cube', 'tightlipped', 'operation', 'feeding', 'thing', 'keeping', 'going', 'recording', 'stuff', 'Two', 'men', 'wathc', 'too', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'asked', 'simply', 'observe', 'fine', 'first', 'soon', 'issue', 'issue', 'simply', 'feeling', 'pangs', 'remorse', 'power', 'odd', 'roads', 'Cube', 'odd', 'ways', 'new', 'movie', 'also', 'something', 'game', 'gamers', 'what', 'transpiring.As', 'far', 'Cube', 'franchise', 'really', 'liked', 'i', 'liked', 'Cube', 'thought', 'Hypercube', 'worked', 'prequel', 'also', 'nice', 'entry', 'Cube', 'stage', 'nice', 'ideas', 'nice', 'acting', 'scale', 'first', 'movie', 'seem', 'advancing', 'Place', 'movies', 'order', 'boom', 'have', 'evolving', 'idea.along', 'also', 'have', 'rating', 'might', 'be', 'odd', 'movie', 'movie', 'would', 'score', 'lower', 'chain', 'movie', 'Cube', 'sequels', 'not', 'exactly', 'rating', 'same', 'Cube', 'title', 'would', 'be', 'comparing', 'Friday', '13th', 'movies', 'do', 'andrank', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'have', 'stuff', 'explain', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'overwhelm', 'also', 'find', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Prime', 'Numbers', 'one', 'seeing', 'how', 'got', 'first', 'movie', 'subject', 'Also', 'seen', 'are', 'shades', 'way', 'outside', 'was', 'seen', 'work', 'way', 'world', 'secret', 'here', 'Basically', 'Cube', 'young', 'taking', 'down', 'everything', 'path', 'knew', 'before', 'do', 'now', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'told', 'answer', 'dread.It', 'rustic', 'look', 'not', 'bad', 'one', 'traps', 'are', 'back', 'Hypercube', 'hurt', 'little', 'way', 'was', 'set', 'new', 'movie', 'up', 'older', 'types', 'torment', 'also', 'here', 'are', 'staples', 'were', 'first', 'movie', 'teams', 'people', 'working', 'through', 'Cube', 'movie', 'would', 'round', '5', 'movie', 'round', '4.Its', 'what', 'want', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Cube', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'will', 'ruin', 'stuff', 'See', 'see', 'like', 'providing', 'give', 'chance', 'realize', 'budget', 'liked', 'like', 'movies', 'can', 'still', 'say', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Sequels', 'already', 'suffer', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'bad', 'turns', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'good', 'stuff', 'up', 'everything', 'else.3.6', '4', 'Not', 'lot', 'extras', 'Cube', 'movies', 'are', 'that.thank']",N/A
875563,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0006Z2LH4,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Considering the enormous disadvantage, `Cube Zero' did a fairly good job of being enjoyable Sci-fi thriller. Though the fact doesn't change that the truly innovative Cube is only the first one, `Cube Zero' is not as bad as the terrible `Cube 2.'The basic premise of `Cube Zero', prequel to the first one, remains the same, but the difference becomes clear to us soon as the film begins. That is, the traps and deaths have become nastier than the two others, as you see the demise of the first ""subject."" Actually, it is probably the nastiest death you ever see in the `Cube' trilogy.Another difference is a more substantial one. In `Cube Zero,' a young computer operator Wynn (Zachary Bennett, who looks like young Charlie Sheen) records and monitors the deaths in the deadly cubes with his partner Dodd in the dark control room. They receive orders from the higher authority, never questioning what they are doing, until Wynn is interested in one female Cassandra in the cube, and finds that there is no consent form signed by her.[SILLY BUT ENTERTAINING] Consent form? Are you serious? `Cube Zero' makes such a misstep as that every fifteen minutes, but the film provides as many good (but slightly silly) ideas, and as a result the ride is fairly enjoyable. There is no claustrophobic atmosphere or the insightful observations about the human nature that you found in the original. `Cube Zero' is a kind of dead-or-alive game (especially in the second half).What is remarkable about the film is the production designs of the cubic rooms and the monitor room. The cubes, which must be one-generation earlier than that of the original film, is made with rougher workmanship, and the deadly traps are more unsophisticated (which means more pains to the victims). The mishmash designs of the monitor room are better than the cubes themselves, and the incongruous combination of the state-of-the-art computer with grey old filing cabinets is a nice idea.But still there are many bad things in it, and they are really bad. The acting from the principal characters is acceptable, if not great. But the worst is the bureaucratic section which is represented by the characters in suit. When they appear, the film suddenly (and unwittingly) becomes a unfunny comedy, and one irritating character Jax with plastic eye virtually ruins the film, swinging a stick, speaking like a magician hired for a child's birthday party. And the ending that is supposed to connect to the first `Cube' looks simply a forced one.Still I enjoyed it as mindless fun, as so-so B-thriller with some scares and gores. Not as great as `Cube,' but far better than `Cube 2.'",3,Prequel Far Better Than the Sequel: Logically Silly But Fairly Enjoyable 'Dead-or-Alive' Thriller,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,2641,"['Considering', 'enormous', 'disadvantage', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'did', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'enjoyable', 'Sci-fi', 'thriller', 'fact', ""n't"", 'change', 'truly', 'innovative', 'Cube', 'only', 'first', 'one', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'terrible', 'Cube', '2', ""'The"", 'basic', 'premise', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'prequel', 'first', 'one', 'same', 'difference', 'clear', 'soon', 'film', 'traps', 'deaths', 'have', 'become', 'nastier', 'two', 'others', 'see', 'demise', 'first', 'subject', 'Actually', 'probably', 'nastiest', 'death', 'ever', 'see', 'Cube', 'trilogy.Another', 'difference', 'more', 'substantial', 'one', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'young', 'computer', 'operator', 'Wynn', 'Zachary', 'Bennett', 'who', 'young', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'records', 'monitors', 'deaths', 'deadly', 'cubes', 'partner', 'Dodd', 'dark', 'control', 'room', 'receive', 'orders', 'higher', 'authority', 'never', 'questioning', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Wynn', 'interested', 'one', 'female', 'Cassandra', 'cube', 'consent', 'form', 'signed', '[', 'SILLY', 'BUT', 'ENTERTAINING', ']', 'Consent', 'form', 'Are', 'serious', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'misstep', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'many', 'good', 'slightly', 'silly', 'ideas', 'result', 'ride', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere', 'insightful', 'observations', 'human', 'nature', 'found', 'original', 'Cube', 'Zero', 'kind', 'dead-or-alive', 'game', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'remarkable', 'film', 'production', 'designs', 'cubic', 'rooms', 'monitor', 'room', 'cubes', 'must', 'be', 'one-generation', 'earlier', 'original', 'film', 'made', 'rougher', 'workmanship', 'deadly', 'traps', 'are', 'more', 'unsophisticated', 'more', 'pains', 'victims', 'mishmash', 'designs', 'monitor', 'room', 'are', 'better', 'cubes', 'incongruous', 'combination', 'state-of-the-art', 'computer', 'grey', 'old', 'filing', 'cabinets', 'nice', 'idea.But', 'still', 'are', 'many', 'bad', 'things', 'are', 'really', 'bad', 'acting', 'principal', 'characters', 'acceptable', 'not', 'great', 'worst', 'bureaucratic', 'section', 'represented', 'characters', 'suit', 'When', 'appear', 'film', 'suddenly', 'unwittingly', 'unfunny', 'comedy', 'one', 'irritating', 'character', 'Jax', 'plastic', 'eye', 'virtually', 'film', 'swinging', 'stick', 'speaking', 'magician', 'hired', 'child', 'birthday', 'party', 'ending', 'supposed', 'connect', 'first', 'Cube', 'simply', 'forced', 'one.Still', 'enjoyed', 'mindless', 'fun', 'so-so', 'B-thriller', 'scares', 'gores', 'Not', 'as', 'great', 'Cube', 'far', 'better', 'Cube', '2']",N/A
