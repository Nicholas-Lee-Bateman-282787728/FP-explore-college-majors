1637838,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00BR1NF7Q,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Stalked at 17 is an odd little movie that has a few good moments. Normally this would be a film that I would dislike, the acting is a cut above soap opera, and the story is simple. On the other hand, the story line was flipped upside down, the details held together rather well, and the production was excellent. This is a film about a teenager getting pregnant with a 21 year old. From the cover art, this film would appear to be some young girl stalked by a creepy old guy. This film was made for Lifetime Television, the DVD release does not include the usual black outs for commercials.The film opens with what seems to be the ending; Chad has a gun, breaks into a house and wants to take his son and Angela with him. So we know Chad is crazy and there will be some major conflict that gets him there. The film then moves to one year earlier and the story fills in. Angela is a sweet sixteen-year-old high school girl with her life in front of her. During a supposed visit to the college in town, she and her friend end up meeting Chad a handsome college boy that appears to be charming. We already know Angela will end up pregnant and Chad is the father. The switch to Chad becoming the creepy guy was well done.Mostly the film is built carefully with good details. There are small things that the director places carefully and then that thing becomes a dramatic moment in the film. He rewarded a few moments of careful observation. And yet he takes it away in one horrible fuzzy memory scene, he beats the flashback to death where there was no need to remind us. Technically, I appreciate the rocks solid well lit camera work. There are no shaky cam handheld moments in this film. The editing is done well and the sound recorded perfectly. It is as if a very talented painter did the paint by numbers picture perfectly. They did scrimp on special effects or the exploding blood packets (that moment was actually pretty funny).Taylor Spreitler (ABC Family Melissa and Joey, and Days of Our Lives) as Angela does a reasonably good job. The other actors are decent, all good middle of the road performances if television acting is the standard. I did laugh when I saw Trent, Angela's friend in high school; he looked older than the 21 year Chad. I hate when they miss ages so badly.I didn't hate this movie, I didn't love it either. There were some moments that were supposed to be serious, but I laughed. I liked the production quality of this film and the attention to details that is always absent in this type of film.I was provided a screener copy of the DVD.",3,Not Bad,1388966400,"01 6, 2014",2014,2567,"['Stalked', '17', 'odd', 'little', 'movie', 'few', 'good', 'moments', 'Normally', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'would', 'dislike', 'acting', 'cut', 'soap', 'opera', 'story', 'simple', 'other', 'hand', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'flipped', 'upside', 'down', 'details', 'held', 'together', 'rather', 'well', 'production', 'was', 'excellent', 'film', 'teenager', 'getting', 'pregnant', '21', 'year', 'old', 'cover', 'art', 'film', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'young', 'girl', 'stalked', 'creepy', 'old', 'guy', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Lifetime', 'Television', 'DVD', 'release', 'not', 'include', 'usual', 'black', 'outs', 'commercials.The', 'film', 'what', 'be', 'ending', 'Chad', 'gun', 'house', 'take', 'son', 'Angela', 'know', 'Chad', 'crazy', 'will', 'be', 'major', 'conflict', 'there', 'film', 'then', 'one', 'year', 'earlier', 'story', 'fills', 'Angela', 'sweet', 'sixteen-year-old', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'life', 'front', 'supposed', 'visit', 'college', 'town', 'friend', 'end', 'up', 'meeting', 'Chad', 'handsome', 'college', 'boy', 'be', 'charming', 'already', 'know', 'Angela', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'pregnant', 'Chad', 'father', 'switch', 'Chad', 'becoming', 'creepy', 'guy', 'was', 'well', 'done.Mostly', 'film', 'built', 'carefully', 'good', 'details', 'are', 'small', 'things', 'director', 'places', 'carefully', 'then', 'thing', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'film', 'rewarded', 'few', 'moments', 'careful', 'observation', 'yet', 'away', 'one', 'horrible', 'fuzzy', 'memory', 'scene', 'flashback', 'death', 'where', 'was', 'need', 'remind', 'Technically', 'appreciate', 'rocks', 'solid', 'well', 'lit', 'camera', 'work', 'are', 'shaky', 'cam', 'handheld', 'moments', 'film', 'editing', 'done', 'well', 'sound', 'recorded', 'perfectly', 'very', 'talented', 'painter', 'did', 'paint', 'numbers', 'picture', 'perfectly', 'did', 'scrimp', 'special', 'effects', 'exploding', 'blood', 'packets', 'moment', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', '.Taylor', 'Spreitler', 'ABC', 'Family', 'Melissa', 'Joey', 'Days', 'Lives', 'Angela', 'reasonably', 'good', 'job', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'decent', 'good', 'middle', 'road', 'television', 'acting', 'standard', 'did', 'when', 'saw', 'Trent', 'Angela', 'friend', 'high', 'school', 'looked', 'older', '21', 'year', 'Chad', 'hate', 'when', 'miss', 'ages', 'so', 'badly.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'either', 'were', 'moments', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'serious', 'laughed', 'liked', 'production', 'quality', 'film', 'attention', 'details', 'always', 'absent', 'type', 'film.I', 'was', 'provided', 'screener', 'copy', 'DVD']",Stalked at 17

1637840,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BR1NF7Q,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","Premiering as a Lifetime network original movie, ""Stalked at 17"" has all the trappings that you would expect from such a distinction. I can be critical of the Lifetime brand with movies that tend to veer between sensationalized instances based on real life and thrillers of fantastical proportions. While ""Stalked at 17"" starts out in a rather unassuming manner, it soon drives toward the latter category as any sense of reality evaporates and craziness takes over.  It's not necessarily a terrible movie from an entertainment standpoint, but you've undoubtedly seen many comparable features that cover the same ground in a better way.Before I get into the movie, though, has anyone else noticed that a lot of terrible things happen when you're seventeen on the Lifetime network? Thing's have gotten really rough for our teenage girls! At last count, we've been Dead at 17, Accused at 17, Betrayed at 17, and a Fugitive at 17! See, there are might be worse things than being Stalked!The movie rests on the shoulders of Taylor Spreitler as the seventeen year old in question.  Unfortunately, though, she lacks the gravitas to make much of an impact or an emotional connection.  Ideally, to get swept up in a story of this sort, you want to have some kind of investment in the central character.  Although Spreitler is wide-eyed and sweet, she is a rather bland dramatic actress (I have not seen her work on ""Melissa & Joey"" or ""Days of Our Lives"").  It doesn't help matters that her leading man is equally vacant.  Chuck Hittinger plays a college age lothario who seduces the young miss.  Although supposedly charming, Hittinger is intensely creepy throughout which lessens the transformation to stalker.  These two one-note performances deaden any of the fun you might have as this escalates into a lurid thriller.  Or is it a heartfelt drama? It really wants it both ways and, thus, falls short in both categories.Spreitler becomes pregnant with Hittinger's child while they are engaged in an age inappropriate relationship.  Her parents, on discovering the identity of the young man, convince her that they would be better off apart.  This releases his last bit of sanity and he (along with his crazy ex-con mom) plan to reunite the reluctant family.  The supporting cast has some familiar faces including Amy Pietz, Brian Krause, Linda Purl, and Jamie Luner who I quite liked.  But with the film focused on the kids, this just failed to involve me in any substantial way.  It's not even smart enough to embrace its lunacy to become a great bad movie because it wants to teach us all a lesson.  Catch it for free on Lifetime, it's diverting enough.  But it's harder to recommend as a DVD purchase.

LeBlanc ""Stephanie Jacobs""","[0, 0]","This movie had all the potentials of being one of those great movies about a guy who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. For the most part, the guy did a great job, trying to act innocent and sweet but suddenly flicking a switch and turning into someone you don't want to be near when he's angry. However, the Taylor Spreitler just didn't give enough emotion for my liking. I wanted this movie to be alot more like the movie Fear with Reese Witherspoon. It was a good movie but didn't elicite the emotional connection from me that i was hoping for.
