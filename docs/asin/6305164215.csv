451980,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305164215,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","A mafia movie starring Jack Nicholson (one of the worlds greatest actors; ever) and co-staring greats like Anjelica Huston and Robert Loggia, directed by the well respected John Huston; I mean, this is a dream come true right?Close.`Prizzi's Honor' is a black comedy revolving around a mafia family and their dysfunctional lives, and for the most part this movie nails it.  There are a few misfires, sadly, but I would be lying if I said that this wasn't very satisfying despite those shortcomings.Charley Partanna is the number one hitman for the Prizzi family.  He was at one time engaged to Dominic Prizzi's daughter Maerose.  After humiliating her family and Charley (by shacking up with another guy) Maerose is ostracized by the family, allowed only to interact with them on special occasions.  The film opens on such an occasion, the wedding of Maerose's sister.  At this wedding Charley happens to meet Irene, a beautiful blonde who strikes his fancy.  They dance, they part, they reunite, they fall in love and decide to marry.  Turns out that Irene is also a hit(wo)man and complications thus ensue as her identity is revealed.  Twists and turns and doublecrossments abound as the film spirals towards a very `Mr. and Mrs. Smith' type conclusion; all of which add layers to this well written and well acted film.The script is a gem, caging wit alongside passion and espionage to create a smart and engaging film that is as thrilling as it is comical.  The gags are subtle, never over-the-top (this isn't `Mafia' people) and they elevate the film, giving it an edge that is welcome.The performances make and break this film; and this is precisely what I mean about a few misfires.  First off, Jack Nicholson delivers seriously one of his finest performances of all time.  This one ranks up with `The Shining' and `About Schmidt' for me as one of the `other' layers of Jack.  For anyone who claims that Jack can only play `Jack' they need to watch this film.  He creates a perfect comedic caricature complete with a new voice, a new walk and a new smile.  He's completely transformed.  Kathleen Turner is one of those actresses I feel never got as big as she should have been.  She always seems to really entertain me, and while I felt that she took a backseat to Nicholson here (he really is all sorts of amazing) she really did her best to rise above.  Robert Loggia is another standout.  He is one of those actors who acts from his head to his toes, and he pulls it off brilliantly.  I remember a scene in particular when he walks out of an elevator and chats up a young lady.  He's out of focus and practically out of view yet our attention is driven to him because he is still very much in character.And then we come to William Hickey and Anjelica Huston; the two Oscar nominees (Nicholson was also nominated, but deservedly so).  I really wanted to like these performances, but they were either extremely annoying or nothing special at all.  Hickey for instance was awful in my book.  I loathed seeing him on the screen.  I really wish that Loggia had received the Oscar nomination instead for his performance was much richer and far better executed.  Huston was not bad, but she did nothing special for me.  I really enjoyed her `there is no honor' speech, but I feel that her win was unnecessary (as was her nomination) and that she really only took home the Oscar because of her family ties.Avery, Winfrey and Tilly were much more deserving.In the end though, I must admit that despite its few shortcomings the film really delivers.  It's funny, it's smart and it's engaging from start to finish and Nicholson really delivers a knockout performance.  I guaranty that you'll enjoy this movie (that is unless you don't) and highly recommend it to any fan of the cast or the genre.  I love gangster movies, and this one has an edge.  A solid B+, maybe even an A- thanks to an A+ performance by Jacky-Boy.",4,This is one satisfying mob hit...,1225929600,"11 6, 2008",2008,3917,"['mafia', 'movie', 'starring', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'one', 'worlds', 'greatest', 'actors', 'ever', 'co-staring', 'greats', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'directed', 'well', 'respected', 'John', 'Huston', 'mean', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'right', 'Close.', 'Prizzi', 'Honor', 'black', 'comedy', 'revolving', 'mafia', 'family', 'dysfunctional', 'lives', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'misfires', 'sadly', 'would', 'be', 'lying', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'satisfying', 'shortcomings.Charley', 'Partanna', 'number', 'one', 'hitman', 'Prizzi', 'family', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'engaged', 'Dominic', 'Prizzi', 'daughter', 'Maerose', 'humiliating', 'family', 'Charley', 'shacking', 'up', 'guy', 'Maerose', 'ostracized', 'family', 'allowed', 'only', 'interact', 'special', 'occasions', 'film', 'occasion', 'wedding', 'Maerose', 'sister', 'wedding', 'Charley', 'meet', 'Irene', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'who', 'fancy', 'dance', 'part', 'reunite', 'fall', 'love', 'decide', 'marry', 'out', 'Irene', 'also', 'hit', 'wo', 'man', 'complications', 'thus', 'ensue', 'identity', 'revealed', 'Twists', 'turns', 'doublecrossments', 'abound', 'film', 'spirals', 'towards', 'very', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'type', 'conclusion', 'add', 'layers', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'film.The', 'script', 'gem', 'caging', 'wit', 'alongside', 'passion', 'espionage', 'create', 'smart', 'engaging', 'film', 'as', 'thrilling', 'comical', 'gags', 'are', 'subtle', 'never', 'over-the-top', ""n't"", 'Mafia', 'people', 'elevate', 'film', 'giving', 'edge', 'welcome.The', 'performances', 'make', 'break', 'film', 'precisely', 'what', 'mean', 'few', 'misfires', 'First', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'seriously', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'time', 'one', 'up', 'Shining', 'Schmidt', 'one', 'other', 'layers', 'Jack', 'anyone', 'who', 'Jack', 'can', 'only', 'play', 'Jack', 'need', 'watch', 'film', 'perfect', 'comedic', 'caricature', 'complete', 'new', 'voice', 'new', 'walk', 'new', 'smile', 'completely', 'transformed', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'one', 'actresses', 'feel', 'never', 'got', 'as', 'big', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'always', 'really', 'entertain', 'felt', 'took', 'backseat', 'Nicholson', 'here', 'really', 'sorts', 'amazing', 'really', 'did', 'best', 'rise', 'above', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'standout', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'head', 'toes', 'off', 'brilliantly', 'remember', 'scene', 'particular', 'when', 'elevator', 'up', 'young', 'lady', 'focus', 'practically', 'view', 'yet', 'attention', 'driven', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'character.And', 'then', 'come', 'William', 'Hickey', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'two', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'deservedly', 'so', 'really', 'wanted', 'performances', 'were', 'either', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'nothing', 'special', 'Hickey', 'instance', 'was', 'awful', 'book', 'loathed', 'seeing', 'screen', 'really', 'wish', 'Loggia', 'had', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'instead', 'performance', 'was', 'much', 'richer', 'far', 'better', 'executed', 'Huston', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'did', 'nothing', 'special', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'honor', 'speech', 'feel', 'win', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'nomination', 'really', 'only', 'took', 'home', 'Oscar', 'family', 'ties.Avery', 'Winfrey', 'Tilly', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'end', 'must', 'admit', 'few', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'really', 'funny', 'smart', 'engaging', 'start', 'finish', 'Nicholson', 'really', 'knockout', 'performance', 'guaranty', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'fan', 'cast', 'genre', 'love', 'gangster', 'movies', 'one', 'edge', 'solid', 'B+', 'maybe', 'even', 'A-', 'thanks', 'A+', 'performance', 'Jacky-Boy']",Prizzi's Honor VHS

451984,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6305164215,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 1]","After watching ""Chinatown"" I was curious to see ""Prizzi's Honor,"" because of the whole Nicholson/Anjelica Huston on again/off again romance that began around the time that Chinatown was shot. There was so much drama behind the set of Chinatown that it was a wonder that the film was made at all, let alone that it was a film noir masterpiece, so my review of Chinatown didn't delve into the father/daughter aspect, but as you may know, John Huston played Noah Cross and Nicholson, as detective Jake Gittes, is involved with Cross' daughter (played by Faye Dunaway). He confronts Noah, who has got to be the worst father since, well, Noah, and I couldn't help wondering how Nicholson's offscreen romance with Huston's daughter affected their respective performances.So, in Prizzi's Honor, Nicholson and John Huston are working together again, but this time Huston is the director, and Anjelica Huston is onscreen this time, as the daughter of a powerful mob family. Anjelica really steals the whole film, and wins an Oscar for her performance. It helps, I guess, if your father is the director, if you are going to steal a film from the ostensible leads, but though John Huston may have been an accessory to the crime, it was really Anjelica's performance that got her that Oscar. She was also great in ""The Grifters,"" if you require further proof of her talent. In Prizzi's Honor, though, she is shown mercilessly manipulating her father, and I'm wondering if John Huston was going, like, so that's how she does it?Anjelica was the best thing about Prizzi's Honor, and as for Director John Huston, Jack Nicholson, and Kathleen Turner, it was not their best work. The main problem I had with Prizzi's Honor was that it was written as a set up for the premise: what if a hit man and a hit woman fell in love, but then each one was hired to kill the other? It was mostly put together well enough so that you are not aware of the carpenters hammering and sawing behind the scenery, but there were a few gaping holes in the plot.Kathleen Turner was adequate as the femme fatale, but didn't generate the body heat she did in ""Who Killed Roger Rabbit?"" let alone ""Body Heat."" Nicholson was really off his game. What was that accent supposed to be? Brooklynese? He reminded me of Archie Bunker, without that man's wit and wisdom. He seemed dazed and confused, and yet he was going to be put in charge of the Prizzi family business? The ""love at first sight"" he was supposed to feel for Turner's hit woman wasn't convincing. When he struggled to articulate his ""feelings"" it was really cringe worthy.I liked William Hickey, the guy who played Don Corrado Prizzi. He had a really gravely voice that could have become grating real fast--but I enjoyed his performance. Perhaps it was meant to be a parody of Marlon Brando as the Godfather. At least he didn't stuff an orange in his mouth.Bottom line is Prizzi's Honor is mainly Anjelica's honor, but for the rest, not their best work. Still, they are all so talented, even when it is not their best work, it is still better than most. John Huston and Jack Nicholson, and many others, were nominated for Oscars for this, but Anjelica is the only one who won one. Though the studio didn't expect it to do well, positive word-of-mouth built up slowly but surely.------------Irene Walker: Charley, I've been doin' three to four hits a year for the past couple of years, most at full pay.Charley Partanna: That many?Irene Walker: Well, it's not many when you consider the size of the population.========The Grifters(1990) Anjelica Huston was Lilly DillonWho Framed Roger Rabbit(1988) (voice) (uncredited) Kathleen Turner was Jessica RabbitThe Dead(1987) Directed by John Huston; Anjelica Huston was Gretta ConroyBody Heat(1981) Kathleen Turner was Matty WalkerOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest(1975) Jack Nicholson was R.P.

Its score, composed by Alex North, adapts music of Puccini and Rossini. It is John Huston's 1984 third last and also his last American film - to be followed by Under the volcano (1984, Mexico) and The dead (1987, Ireland).The film tells the story of a mob hit man (Nicholson) and hit woman (Turner) who fall in love, even though they have been hired to kill each other.Critic Pauline Kael wrote: ""This John Huston picture has a ripe and daring comic tone. It revels voluptuously in the murderous finagling of the members of a Brooklyn Mafia family, and rejoices in their scams. It's like The Godfather acted out by The Munsters. Jack Nicholson's average-guyness as Charley, the clan's enforcer, is the film's touchstone: this is a baroque comedy about people who behave in ordinary ways in grotesque circumstances, and it has the juice of everyday family craziness in it.""Perhaps to be added is that in what must be one of the longest shots, to an Ave Maria impeccably sung during a church wedding, we see Nicholson looking around and discovering Turner; later, in the reception hall, a similar search, ending in a tarantella style Southern Italian dance by Nicholson and his newly found partner. Nicholson, of whom one tends to think to have seen him in any possible role, reaches new heights as mobster supremo designate.115us - Prizzi's honor (John Huston, 1983, 130`) - 27/7/2012",5,Huston's American Exit,1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,1763,"['Prizzi', 'honor', 'John', 'Huston', '1983', '130', 'Prizzi', 'Honor', '1985', 'American', 'black', 'comedy', 'film', 'directed', 'John', 'Huston', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'who', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'role', 'Maerose', 'Prizzi', '.The', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'Richard', 'Condon', 'Janet', 'Roach', 'Condon', 'novel', 'same', 'name', '1982', 'score', 'composed', 'Alex', 'North', 'adapts', 'music', 'Puccini', 'Rossini', 'John', 'Huston', '1984', 'third', 'last', 'also', 'last', 'American', 'film', 'be', 'followed', 'volcano', '1984', 'Mexico', 'dead', '1987', 'Ireland', '.The', 'film', 'story', 'mob', 'hit', 'man', 'Nicholson', 'hit', 'woman', 'Turner', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'hired', 'kill', 'other.Critic', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'wrote', 'John', 'Huston', 'picture', 'ripe', 'daring', 'comic', 'tone', 'voluptuously', 'murderous', 'finagling', 'members', 'Brooklyn', 'Mafia', 'family', 'rejoices', 'scams', 'Godfather', 'acted', 'out', 'Munsters', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'average-guyness', 'Charley', 'clan', 'enforcer', 'film', 'touchstone', 'baroque', 'comedy', 'people', 'who', 'behave', 'ordinary', 'ways', 'grotesque', 'circumstances', 'juice', 'everyday', 'family', 'craziness', 'Perhaps', 'be', 'added', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'longest', 'shots', 'Ave', 'Maria', 'impeccably', 'sung', 'church', 'wedding', 'see', 'Nicholson', 'looking', 'around', 'discovering', 'Turner', 'later', 'reception', 'hall', 'similar', 'search', 'ending', 'tarantella', 'style', 'Southern', 'Italian', 'dance', 'Nicholson', 'newly', 'found', 'partner', 'Nicholson', 'whom', 'one', 'think', 'have', 'seen', 'possible', 'role', 'new', 'heights', 'mobster', 'supremo', 'designate.115us', 'Prizzi', 'honor', 'John', 'Huston', '1983', '130', '27/7/2012']",Prizzi's Honor VHS

Instead,  I ask how well it held my attention and interest, and how much it made me  reflect afterwards. This movie accomplished all of these.

It's pure film noir though you wouldn't think so until the ending - which is just about as hard as nails.  I'm not saying it's the 'best' gangster film I've ever seen, but sheesh, it packs a punch you'll be reeling from by the time the credits roll.  And sure we expect brutality as the foundation for any decent mob flick, but this one kind of reached into new territory for me.  The movie played out the way it had to and it's kind of tough to stomach on an emotional level.  But from the point of view of the story, and it's characters, the movie does not falter and stays true to its logic.The performances are great all around. The old don in this movie is incredible - creepy and decrepitly sinister, a very unique 'don' character in the catalogue of mafia movies.  Charlie's father was great, and of course Nicholson does a GREAT job as Italian gangster Charley Pattana - his acting is distinct and fitting (i.e. he goes beyond himself as himself).  Kathleen Turner as his love interest then wife, Irene, was likeable as well.  I wasn't always sure I bought the chemistry 100%, but the movie is bigger than just their relationship - which certainly wasn't bad by any accounts - just not 'sizzling', for all the love that was professed.  Then again this is love between a hit-woman and a gangster, so I don't know what exactly one could hope for.  There was a certain touchingness in the trust that develops between them, and of course there's a comic tone that lightens the whole thing in the first place - but never to the detriment of the story.  The light tone in fact only enhances its noirish resolution in the end driving the hammer down upon the nail of irony - or destiny, as this movie would have it.Irene: ""I've been doing 3 or 4 hits a year for the last few years, most of them full pay.""Charlie: ""That many?""Irene: ""Well, it's not that many when you consider the size of the population.""",5,My God - what a ruthless movie,1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,2027,"['comic', 'tone', 'one', 'hardest', 'hitting', 'gangster', 'flicks', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'ever', 'pure', 'film', 'noir', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'ending', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'hard', 'nails', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""'best"", 'gangster', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'sheesh', 'punch', ""'ll"", 'be', 'reeling', 'time', 'credits', 'roll', 'sure', 'expect', 'brutality', 'foundation', 'decent', 'mob', 'flick', 'one', 'kind', 'reached', 'new', 'territory', 'movie', 'played', 'out', 'way', 'had', 'kind', 'tough', 'stomach', 'emotional', 'level', 'point', 'view', 'story', 'characters', 'movie', 'not', 'falter', 'stays', 'true', 'logic.The', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'around', 'old', 'don', 'movie', 'incredible', 'creepy', 'decrepitly', 'sinister', 'very', 'unique', ""'don"", 'character', 'catalogue', 'mafia', 'movies', 'Charlie', 'father', 'was', 'great', 'course', 'Nicholson', 'GREAT', 'job', 'Italian', 'gangster', 'Charley', 'Pattana', 'acting', 'distinct', 'fitting', 'i.e', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'love', 'interest', 'then', 'wife', 'Irene', 'was', 'likeable', 'as', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'sure', 'bought', 'chemistry', '100', '%', 'movie', 'bigger', 'just', 'relationship', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'accounts', 'just', 'not', ""'sizzling"", 'love', 'was', 'professed', 'Then', 'again', 'love', 'hit-woman', 'gangster', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'exactly', 'one', 'could', 'hope', 'was', 'certain', 'touchingness', 'trust', 'course', 'comic', 'tone', 'whole', 'thing', 'first', 'place', 'never', 'detriment', 'story', 'light', 'tone', 'fact', 'only', 'noirish', 'resolution', 'end', 'driving', 'hammer', 'down', 'nail', 'irony', 'destiny', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'it.Irene', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', '3', '4', 'hits', 'year', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'most', 'full', 'pay', 'Charlie', 'many', 'Irene', 'Well', 'not', 'that', 'many', 'when', 'consider', 'size', 'population']",Prizzi's Honor VHS

Can two hitmen or hitman and hitwoman find love and happiness together? Here is a black comedy that does not take itself too seriously. There is plenty of violence but somehow the edge is on the farce of to killers finding each other. No surprise as to who they are each hired to kill.Kathleen Turner stars at the female killer and she has never been lovelier or livelier. Anjelica Huston shines as the mobster's daughter who has  shamed her family and has been banisged. She has been wronged by everyone and is out for revengedAnother stand-out is William Hickey as the ""Godfather"" of the Prizzi clan of thugs. He looks and acts creepy and is obviously made up to look much older than his actual age.

It is nothing but outlandish and terroristic. It takes all Jack Nicholson can give to make these characters in anyway palatable, and even so. In the Prizzi family all other considerations than the family is outlawed, except maybe for a couple of weeks and the woman concerned by this out-breeding passing passion has to submit and take the color of the wall on which she is being pinned. If she does not then she will be executed and cut off. There is no depth in that film, no subtleties or even subtlety. Get the message, bang it down on the table and then cram it down your brain. Business is business and in-breeding is the rule. I will always wonder why a hit-woman with a reputation of efficiency and effectiveness misses her husband when he intends to kill her though she manages to shoot one bullet first. Suspend your disbelief and incredulity. The cinema is the new church of the visual dominant animal man is. To see is to believe. But at times to believe is easier when you are blind, and probably deaf too.

From the very beginning I was instantly engaged in a compelling story that was pure comic genius as well as having a touch of tragedy.  Jack Nicholson is cast as a hit man in a Mafia family.  He's amazing in this role and even gets the New York Brooklyn accent right.  The film opens at a wedding with all its pomp and glory.  That's where Nicholson spots the blonde and beautiful Kathleen Turner.  He asks her to dance and is immediately smitten.  Suddenly she is called away.  Who is she?  Why was she at the wedding.  All this is a mystery at first.Eventually Nicholson romances the evasive Turner.  He's in love.  He wants to marry her.  And then he finds out that she, too, is an assassin and they both work for the same bosses.  The plot twists and turns and Angelica Houston, who later won an Academy Award for her role in this film, is cast as the black sheep of the family with her own grudge to bear against Nicholson, is looking for her own kind of revenge.

The romance flourishes for a time. The complications that ensue are best revealed while viewing the film.Previously, Partanna had ended his relationship with Maerose Prizzi (Angelica Huston), Don Corrado Prizzi 's beloved but volatile granddaughter. She is determined to regain the favor of the family's elders, especially its Don. Later, Huston received an Academy Award for best performance by an actress in a supporting role. She deserved it. Although apparently quite talented in his line of work, Charley often seems somewhat dimwitted, at least when contrasted with Irene who seems highly intelligent as well as physically attractive. Watching Nicholson play a smitten, almost schoolboyish Charlie is indeed a treat.Director John Huston does a brilliant job of juxtaposing romantic comedy with mob-directed violence. Amidst all the laughter, people really do get killed. William Hickey certainly deserved his nomination  for an Academy Award for best actor in a supporting role, won in 1985 by Don Ameche for his work in Cocoon. Hickey and other members of the cast were blessed with having an immensely clever script by Richard Condon, based on his novel. Listen carefully to Hickey's reading of his lines while also paying close attention to his masterful use of body language. Don Corrado Prizzi is indeed a lovable but deadly senior citizen. Yes, this film is highly entertaining. Witty, at times zany.
