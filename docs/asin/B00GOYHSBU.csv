A group of troubled teens head over to an abandonded farm to take down a scarecrow but something sinister awaits. I cant tell if the creature was cgi or not but they did a very good job in creating it. This was one of the most enjoyable syfy channel has ever put out, highly recommend it.",5,Scarecrow,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,358,"['Scarecrow', 'film', 'nothing', 'new', 'still', 'well', 'done', 'group', 'troubled', 'teens', 'head', 'abandonded', 'farm', 'take', 'down', 'scarecrow', 'something', 'sinister', 'awaits', 'cant', 'tell', 'creature', 'was', 'cgi', 'not', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'creating', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'syfy', 'channel', 'ever', 'put', 'out', 'highly', 'recommend']",Scarecrow

Even though the movie is paced reasonably well, it lacks the charm that a movie about a killer scarecrow should have. Also, the titular monster is a bad CGI effect if ever there was one. Why didn't they cast a man in a suit for the part? It would have been far more effective.",3,It didn't scare this crow!,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,417,"['Scarecrow', 'horror', 'film', 'were', ""n't"", 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'looking', 'fine', 'gory', 'aftermaths', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'anything', 'Even', 'movie', 'paced', 'reasonably', 'well', 'charm', 'movie', 'killer', 'scarecrow', 'should', 'have', 'Also', 'titular', 'monster', 'bad', 'CGI', 'effect', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'cast', 'man', 'suit', 'part', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'effective']",Scarecrow

1680062,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00GOYHSBU,Matthew Scott Baker,"[3, 3]","The image of the scarecrow awakens a deeply rooted primal fear within me.  I&#8217;m not exactly sure why, but there&#8217;s something about it that makes my skin crawl.  As such, movies about scarecrows are a true horrific treat for me.  The SyFy Channel released a movie simply titled SCARECROW last year, and I have to admit that it is one of the better ones produced by their studios over the last couple of years.  And while not perfect, this flick contains some creepy effects and nice intensity.SCARECROW is shot well overall, and its production value looks pretty high.  I like the locations used in the filming; the desolate farm surrounded by corn is a great backdrop for building terror.  And the boat graveyard, in which the last section of the movie takes place, is perfectly eerie.The special effects are good, too, especially for a TV movie.  The CG that is used for the scarecrow looks good, and there&#8217;s some very nice gore throughout.  One particularly gruesome scene shows the sliced open thigh of a girl who falls through a rotted floor.  The good effects combined with a close-up shot of the wound will make even the heartiest of gore-hounds cringe.I am impressed with the acting in SCARECROW as well.  Granted, it is not super-high caliber, but the cast does a great job nonetheless.  Robin Dunne and Lacey Chabert, as the main characters, play off of each other well and portray a solid sense of onscreen chemistry.  Likewise, the supporting cast do a lot to lend credibility to this production.But even though the film is a lot of fun, it does have some glaring flaws.  First and foremost for me is the lack of character development.  We are never really given many reasons to care about the characters, which in turn tones down the tension quite a bit.  Secondly, the legend of the scarecrow is never fully fleshed out.  It is hinted at many times, but there&#8217;s never any solid conclusion.Still, SCARECROW is entertaining and fans of lower-budgeted features should enjoy this one.  This isn&#8217;t schlocky horror, like some of the other SyFy Channel titles; instead, this is a true attempt at bona fide terror.  And while the end result might not be perfect, it is certainly worth checking out.  I can&#8217;t wait to see what SyFy and director Sheldon Wilson do next.",3,Decent SyFy Channel horror flick,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,2305,"['image', 'scarecrow', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'primal', 'fear', '8217', 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'why', 'there', '8217', 'something', 'skin', 'crawl', 'such', 'movies', 'scarecrows', 'are', 'true', 'horrific', 'treat', 'SyFy', 'Channel', 'released', 'movie', 'simply', 'titled', 'SCARECROW', 'last', 'year', 'have', 'admit', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'produced', 'studios', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'not', 'perfect', 'flick', 'creepy', 'effects', 'nice', 'intensity.SCARECROW', 'shot', 'well', 'overall', 'production', 'value', 'pretty', 'high', 'locations', 'used', 'filming', 'desolate', 'farm', 'surrounded', 'corn', 'great', 'backdrop', 'building', 'terror', 'boat', 'graveyard', 'last', 'section', 'movie', 'place', 'perfectly', 'eerie.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'especially', 'TV', 'movie', 'CG', 'used', 'scarecrow', 'good', 'there', '8217', 'very', 'nice', 'gore', 'One', 'particularly', 'gruesome', 'scene', 'sliced', 'open', 'thigh', 'girl', 'who', 'rotted', 'floor', 'good', 'effects', 'combined', 'close-up', 'shot', 'wound', 'will', 'make', 'even', 'heartiest', 'gore-hounds', 'cringe.I', 'am', 'impressed', 'acting', 'SCARECROW', 'as', 'well', 'Granted', 'not', 'super-high', 'caliber', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'nonetheless', 'Robin', 'Dunne', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'main', 'characters', 'play', 'other', 'well', 'portray', 'solid', 'sense', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'Likewise', 'supporting', 'cast', 'do', 'lot', 'lend', 'credibility', 'production.But', 'even', 'film', 'lot', 'fun', 'have', 'glaring', 'flaws', 'First', 'foremost', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'given', 'many', 'reasons', 'care', 'characters', 'turn', 'tones', 'down', 'tension', 'quite', 'bit', 'Secondly', 'legend', 'scarecrow', 'never', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'hinted', 'many', 'times', 'there', '8217', 'never', 'solid', 'conclusion.Still', 'SCARECROW', 'entertaining', 'fans', 'lower-budgeted', 'features', 'should', 'enjoy', 'one', 'isn', '8217', 'schlocky', 'horror', 'other', 'SyFy', 'Channel', 'instead', 'true', 'attempt', 'bona', 'fide', 'terror', 'end', 'result', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'certainly', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'can', '8217', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'SyFy', 'director', 'Sheldon', 'Wilson', 'do', 'next']",Scarecrow

1680065,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00GOYHSBU,Wuchak,"[5, 5]","Released on Syfy in October, 2013, ""Scarecrow"" is a very good flick for the Halloween season. The story has to do with a farm that had been cursed for a hundred years and a school detention group that goes there to do some work. A scary-looking creature appears and starts picking them off one-by-one.There are some similarities to the hallowed ""Night of the Living Dead"" in that the group take refuge in the farm house but, unlike that film, they don't spend the entire story there. They eventually depart and are chased by the creature.Why do I rate ""Scarecrow"" as high as I do? For one, the filmmakers and actors take the material seriously and so the film never devolves into parody or camp. As such, the viewer is able to take it seriously.Secondly, the CGI monster is excellent even though it doesn't resemble a scarecrow at all. It's scary-looking, sort of smoke-like and, therefore, changes shape constantly while remaining the same basic appearance.Thirdly, the film features a quality cast of women. There are no less than FIVE, all stunning or near-stunning in their own unique way, starting with the blond (Lanie McAuley) in the teaser. From there we get four petite brunettes, beginning with the curvaceous delinquent played by Julia Maxwell, whose role is way too brief. Then there are Nicole Mu&ntilde;oz, Lacey Chabert and Brittney Wilson. Lacey slowly emerges as the film's protagonist while Brittney becomes the quasi-villain.Lastly, the Vancouver-area locations are effective for this type of film, particularly the ""ship graveyard"" in the final act.GRADE: A-",5,"""Scarecrow"" delivers",1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,1578,"['Released', 'Syfy', 'October', '2013', 'Scarecrow', 'very', 'good', 'flick', 'Halloween', 'season', 'story', 'do', 'farm', 'had', 'been', 'cursed', 'hundred', 'years', 'school', 'detention', 'group', 'there', 'do', 'work', 'scary-looking', 'creature', 'picking', 'are', 'similarities', 'hallowed', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'group', 'take', 'refuge', 'farm', 'house', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'entire', 'story', 'there', 'eventually', 'depart', 'are', 'chased', 'creature.Why', 'do', 'rate', 'Scarecrow', 'as', 'high', 'do', 'one', 'filmmakers', 'actors', 'take', 'material', 'seriously', 'so', 'film', 'never', 'parody', 'camp', 'such', 'viewer', 'able', 'take', 'seriously.Secondly', 'CGI', 'monster', 'excellent', 'even', ""n't"", 'resemble', 'scarecrow', 'scary-looking', 'sort', 'smoke-like', 'therefore', 'changes', 'shape', 'constantly', 'remaining', 'same', 'basic', 'appearance.Thirdly', 'film', 'quality', 'cast', 'women', 'are', 'less', 'FIVE', 'stunning', 'near-stunning', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'starting', 'blond', 'Lanie', 'McAuley', 'teaser', 'get', 'four', 'petite', 'brunettes', 'beginning', 'curvaceous', 'delinquent', 'played', 'Julia', 'Maxwell', 'role', 'way', 'too', 'brief', 'Then', 'are', 'Nicole', 'Mu', 'ntilde', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'Brittney', 'Wilson', 'Lacey', 'slowly', 'film', 'protagonist', 'Brittney', 'quasi-villain.Lastly', 'Vancouver-area', 'locations', 'are', 'effective', 'type', 'film', 'particularly', 'ship', 'graveyard', 'final', 'act.GRADE', 'A-']",Scarecrow
