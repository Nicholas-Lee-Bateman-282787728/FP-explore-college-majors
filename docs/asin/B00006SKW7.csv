723592,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B00006SKW7,I. Giles,"[0, 0]","This production is one of three Offenbach operettas that Minkowski has conducted. All have been notable for great energy and attention to detail.Orpheus in the Underworld is, of course, a version of the Greek tragedy that is anything but tragic. Fundamentally it is a send-up of the original story where both Orpheus and Eurydice have grown tired of each other for various reasons and their amorous attention has been caught elsewhere. In addition to this, both Jupiter and Pluto are determined to gain Eurydice for themselves. Eventually everyone ends up in Hell which, far from being a place of torture is a place of constant partying. This is where Eurydice would prefer to remain and Orpheus too would be happier with this solution so no sorrow, except that expressed by the character of 'Public Opinion' is expressed and the whole story ends with general jubilation.The whole cast of this sparkling and sacrilegious production enter fully into the spirit and the racy pace is maintained throughout. The leading parts of Orpheus, Eurydice, Jupiter and Pluto are both sung and acted with great energy and musical skill and as if they were individually born for the parts they take. Dessay has a wonderful time singing effortlessly while engaging in all sorts of non-musical activities. The same can be said especially for Laurent Naouri as Jupiter. One could really go on and list all the cast but I will content myself with simply including the dancers and the choreography for constantly uplifting work in every sense! Very imaginative.The orchestral contribution under their conductor is played with total commitment, considerable verve and plenty of enthusiasm.The settings and costumes could be described as bizarre and this is where it all becomes a matter of personal taste. They are sufficiently extreme to cause pleasure, or somewhat less likely, irritation, for those with firm views. My own view is that the whole thing is supposed to be a send-up so sending up the setting is probably appropriate so long as the musical values are not compromised and crucially, this performance delivers enormously well on the music.So a strong recommendation from me with just a small element of caution. If you are a strong traditionalist you may not be so keen! In my opinion though, this one is an out and out winner and well worth the full 5 stars.",5,Very enjoyable with all the usual Minkowski virtues - but maybe not for traditionalists,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,2352,"['production', 'one', 'three', 'Offenbach', 'operettas', 'Minkowski', 'conducted', 'have', 'been', 'notable', 'great', 'energy', 'attention', 'detail.Orpheus', 'Underworld', 'course', 'version', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'anything', 'tragic', 'Fundamentally', 'send-up', 'original', 'story', 'where', 'Orpheus', 'Eurydice', 'have', 'grown', 'tired', 'other', 'various', 'reasons', 'amorous', 'attention', 'been', 'caught', 'elsewhere', 'addition', 'Jupiter', 'Pluto', 'are', 'determined', 'gain', 'Eurydice', 'Eventually', 'everyone', 'up', 'Hell', 'far', 'being', 'place', 'torture', 'place', 'constant', 'partying', 'where', 'Eurydice', 'would', 'prefer', 'remain', 'Orpheus', 'too', 'would', 'be', 'happier', 'solution', 'so', 'no', 'sorrow', 'expressed', 'character', ""'Public"", 'Opinion', 'expressed', 'whole', 'story', 'general', 'jubilation.The', 'whole', 'cast', 'sparkling', 'sacrilegious', 'production', 'enter', 'fully', 'spirit', 'racy', 'pace', 'maintained', 'leading', 'parts', 'Orpheus', 'Eurydice', 'Jupiter', 'Pluto', 'are', 'sung', 'acted', 'great', 'energy', 'musical', 'skill', 'were', 'individually', 'born', 'parts', 'take', 'Dessay', 'wonderful', 'time', 'singing', 'effortlessly', 'engaging', 'sorts', 'non-musical', 'activities', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'especially', 'Laurent', 'Naouri', 'Jupiter', 'One', 'could', 'really', 'go', 'list', 'cast', 'will', 'content', 'simply', 'including', 'dancers', 'choreography', 'constantly', 'uplifting', 'work', 'sense', 'Very', 'imaginative.The', 'orchestral', 'contribution', 'conductor', 'played', 'total', 'commitment', 'considerable', 'verve', 'plenty', 'enthusiasm.The', 'settings', 'costumes', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'bizarre', 'where', 'matter', 'personal', 'taste', 'are', 'sufficiently', 'extreme', 'cause', 'pleasure', 'somewhat', 'less', 'likely', 'irritation', 'firm', 'views', 'own', 'view', 'whole', 'thing', 'supposed', 'be', 'send-up', 'so', 'sending', 'up', 'setting', 'probably', 'appropriate', 'so', 'long', 'musical', 'values', 'are', 'not', 'compromised', 'crucially', 'performance', 'enormously', 'well', 'music.So', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'just', 'small', 'element', 'caution', 'are', 'strong', 'traditionalist', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'keen', 'opinion', 'one', 'out', 'winner', 'well', 'full', '5', 'stars']",Orphée aux enfers
723593,A25E01HTNT53KL,B00006SKW7,James M. Rawley,"[11, 13]","I was a little disappointed in this production. The first worst thing I noticed was that Pluto was sung by a man who had to have his first song rewritten: the original range was perhaps beyond him, and I noticed his voice was particularly harsh, compared with a classic LP of the opera I used to have. In fact all the performers were comparatively wanting in sweetness.Even Dessay, though versatile, strong-voiced and hard-working -- she has a lot of songs -- acted well, but without the beautiful sexy coyness that earlier operetta stars brought to the part. Her voice was strong, and didn't suffer from narrowness of range, like Pluto's, but she was never quite light and funny enough. Her voice lacked charm and her acting lacked irony.The production got tangled up a little in its modernization. For example the cancan was not danced by the performers, in two senses: dancers were brought on when the cancan was played, and what they danced was not the cancan. Cancan in French means ""scandal,"" and we could hardly be scandalized by the dance itself -- women kicking up their heels and showing their legs -- when the dancers were already bare-legged, had been throughout the show, and the male dancers were cross-dressed, also from the beginning. The dancers' cancan was a series of uninspired tumbling of the female dancers over the male dancers' knees: not scandalous and barely adequate as choreography.Stuffier old-fashioned costuming all around would have helped, since the plot is about how both Orpheus and Eurydice are in love with other people and only stay together because of the pressure of public opinion. Maybe that atmosphere is too dated to reproduce for a modern audience, but the modern substitute is inevitably a little incoherent.I was going to show the opera to a friend as an example of Offenbach at his best, but my friend is skeptical about Offenbach and this production is too heavy to convert her. Offenbach doesn't require just good singing and acting; it requires mastery of a particular light operatic style, and that style's great masters may not be around any longer.It was still a pleasant show for a fan like me.",3,Slightly disappointing,1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,2149,"['was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'production', 'first', 'worst', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'Pluto', 'was', 'sung', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'have', 'first', 'song', 'rewritten', 'original', 'range', 'was', 'perhaps', 'noticed', 'voice', 'was', 'particularly', 'harsh', 'compared', 'classic', 'LP', 'opera', 'used', 'have', 'fact', 'performers', 'were', 'comparatively', 'wanting', 'sweetness.Even', 'Dessay', 'though', 'versatile', 'strong-voiced', 'hard-working', 'lot', 'songs', 'acted', 'well', 'beautiful', 'sexy', 'coyness', 'earlier', 'operetta', 'stars', 'brought', 'part', 'voice', 'was', 'strong', 'did', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'narrowness', 'range', 'Pluto', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'light', 'funny', 'enough', 'Her', 'voice', 'lacked', 'charm', 'acting', 'lacked', 'irony.The', 'production', 'got', 'tangled', 'up', 'little', 'modernization', 'example', 'cancan', 'was', 'not', 'danced', 'performers', 'two', 'senses', 'dancers', 'were', 'brought', 'when', 'cancan', 'was', 'played', 'what', 'danced', 'was', 'not', 'cancan', 'Cancan', 'French', 'means', 'scandal', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'scandalized', 'dance', 'women', 'kicking', 'up', 'heels', 'showing', 'legs', 'when', 'dancers', 'were', 'already', 'bare-legged', 'had', 'been', 'show', 'male', 'dancers', 'were', 'cross-dressed', 'also', 'beginning', 'dancers', 'cancan', 'was', 'series', 'uninspired', 'tumbling', 'female', 'dancers', 'male', 'dancers', 'knees', 'not', 'scandalous', 'barely', 'adequate', 'choreography.Stuffier', 'old-fashioned', 'costuming', 'around', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'plot', 'how', 'Orpheus', 'Eurydice', 'are', 'love', 'other', 'people', 'only', 'stay', 'together', 'pressure', 'public', 'opinion', 'Maybe', 'too', 'dated', 'reproduce', 'modern', 'audience', 'modern', 'substitute', 'inevitably', 'little', 'incoherent.I', 'was', 'going', 'show', 'opera', 'friend', 'example', 'Offenbach', 'best', 'friend', 'skeptical', 'Offenbach', 'production', 'too', 'heavy', 'convert', 'Offenbach', ""n't"", 'require', 'just', 'good', 'singing', 'acting', 'mastery', 'particular', 'light', 'operatic', 'style', 'style', 'great', 'masters', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'longer.It', 'was', 'still', 'pleasant', 'show', 'fan']",Orphée aux enfers

I would have preferred a better can-can too at the end - a tad crowded and the dance itself gets lost - better so, because it is a mostly male cast of dancers. I wish they hadnt dressed up Dessey as a Tart most of the time. It kinda gives the impression that one has to be a tart to have a mind of ones own as regards lovers, especially since Euridice was supposed to be ravishing looking - the daughter of Aphrodite. Bad....The Good? Absolutely everything from the conductor (Minkowsky is perhaps at his best here) to all the singers. Although I sort of missed the overture, at the end, with the type of treatment that the operetta gets here, it wasnt too badly missed.My first DVD of this got stolen, and if I was tempted to buy another one paying more than what I did for the first one, you can be assured it is worth it... am reputed to be a miser....",4,Great Stuff,1268179200,"03 10, 2010",2010,988,"['bad', 'have', 'seen', 'plenty', 'transvestites', 'get', 'here', 'rather', 'overkill', 'even', 'French', 'production', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'better', 'can-can', 'too', 'end', 'tad', 'crowded', 'dance', 'lost', 'better', 'so', 'mostly', 'male', 'cast', 'dancers', 'wish', 'hadnt', 'dressed', 'up', 'Dessey', 'Tart', 'most', 'time', 'kinda', 'impression', 'one', 'be', 'tart', 'have', 'mind', 'ones', 'own', 'regards', 'lovers', 'especially', 'Euridice', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'ravishing', 'looking', 'daughter', 'Aphrodite', 'Bad', '.The', 'Good', 'Absolutely', 'everything', 'conductor', 'Minkowsky', 'perhaps', 'best', 'here', 'singers', 'sort', 'missed', 'overture', 'end', 'type', 'treatment', 'operetta', 'here', 'wasnt', 'too', 'badly', 'missed.My', 'first', 'DVD', 'got', 'stolen', 'was', 'tempted', 'buy', 'one', 'paying', 'more', 'what', 'did', 'first', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'am', 'reputed', 'be', 'miser']",Orphée aux enfers
