1367775,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B003VRV9CW,blackaciddevil,"[0, 0]","As far as sequels go, 30 Days of Night: Dark Days is a good example why sequels that usually go straight to DVD are not worth the time. With 30 Days of Night, the movie delivered on pretty much every level(tension, gore, scares). Yet, with 30 Days of Night: Dark Days, they squander everything that made the first one so great.The film is based on the graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith, and adapted for the screen by Steve Niles and Director Ben Ketai. It tells the story of Stella Oleson,a survivor from the first film.  She leaves Alaska and has moved to Los Angeles.  There,  she spends her time trying to spread the word about what happened to the town & people of Barrow. No one believes her, of course. When a group of Vampires offer her a chance to exact revenge upon the vampire queen, Stella joins their mission to stop her from striking again.To my understanding, this is a reasonably faithful adaptation of the Dark Days comic book. I also hear that Steve Niles was happy with it. Although I've never read it, I'm sure it has to be way better than this movie. It's evident it was made on a much lower budget than the first one. The acting wasn't as good, either. I feel I would've bought into this movie, regardless of budget, alot more if they'd brought the original Stella(Melissa George)back to reprise her role. I think that is why this movie didn't quite gel with me. This movie felt foreign to me.Don't get me wrong, 30 Days of Night isn't completely unwatchable. It does have its' moments. I've seen far worser movies. But, more often than not, it drops the ball and that makes it awfully hard for me to like it. All I can recommend is that you rent before you buy. Don't make the mistake of buying it before you see it like I did, because I'm a little disappointed with my purchase.

Alas, it was junk.  The best parts of the movie were the brief flashbacks of carnage from the original film.  The original wasn't incredible, either, when it comes to story and character development, but it was still one heck of a fun rollercoaster ride of gore, action and atmosphere with a cool premise.  The second film is a mess.  I was surprised to read a few favorable reviews for this from horror film sites and magazines that I admire.  That's probably why my expectations were a bit raised.  Anyway, character development is non-existent, the plot is blah, and there is no sense of consistency between the first and second films.  To me, sorry Niles, it just seems like another  vampire-fad cash-in that was thrown together and sloppily executed.

It a movie that had an intriguing concept, but couldn't manage a three-act structure.That makes ""30 Days of Night: Dark Days"" one of the few sequels that actually is slightly better than the original. But it falls prey to the same problem as the original movie -- the middle section is basically a big repetitive mass of nothing, just to pad out the space between The Beginning and The End. And sadly, most of the characters barely even register, although Kiele Sanchez does a solid job.A year after Eben's death, Stella (Sanchez) has been trying to warn the world about vampires. She makes a fairly decent point when she unleashes ultraviolet lights during a lecture, killing several vampires hiding among the humans. But the whole thing is covered up by the hostile FBI Agent Norris (Troy Ruptash), who is determined to silence her.After that display, Stells is contacted by a trio of amateur vampire hunters (Rhys Coiro, Harold Perrineau, Diora Baird) who are working for a mysterious man named Dane (Ben Cotton). From them, she learns that the vampire queen Lilith (Mia Kirshner) is somewhere nearby, and that killing her might remove the vampire threat once and for all.""30 Days of Night: Dark Days"" has basically the same problem as the first movie -- the middle section is just a bunch of talking and repetitive fight scenes, and not much of it actually advances the plot. The only difference is that this time, the main story is basically your standard vampire-hunters-trying-to-destroy-all-vampirekind that has been done to death elsewhere.The entire movie is filmed in a grimy, low-budget manner, which works pretty well, but so much time is spent nattering, bickering and killing vampire mooks that it's hard to get invested. Admittedly things pick up at the bloody, gloriously violent finale, which introduces some unexpectedly awesome action for Stella, but by then the audience will probably be asleep.And along the way, the vampires themselves seem to have changed -- these are not the nightmare hellspawn of the previous movie, but more typical, devious, hierarchical vampires. And there are a bunch of aspects of them that are never explained, such as how one particular vampire hangs on to his humanity. What?Kiele Sanchez does a pretty good job as Stella, bringing across all the numbing fear and grief that is left behind once the vampires are gone. And Kirshner does a pretty decent job playing the numero uno vampire, with casual cruelty. She doesn't even seem to really think about it, because everyone else is under her notice.Sadly none of the other actors get to do much -- Cotton is mostly there to spew exposition, Harold Perrineau is there to die, and Diora Baird is there to be whiny and complain about Stella. Rhys Coiro is decent because his character is given some backstory, but he feels like a shoehorned-in love interest for Stella since Eben is absent.""30 Days of Night: Dark Days"" is almost a decent vampire-hunting movie, but the sludgy, tedious middle section and underdeveloped characters sink it.

So when this film was first released I was really excited, I even liked the short films that were on FEARnet. So I was all about this film coming out and I am a fan of Sam Raimi and his Ghost House Pictures which produced all of these films. This second film is based on the graphic novel of the same name.Stella has moved on from Barrow and is now in LA trying to educate people on the vampire threat that really exists. Most people do not believe her until she hits the ultraviolet lights that kill off the vamps in attendance. After a run in with the law who happens to be working with the vampires she comes across a team of hunters. These hunters want her help in killing of the queen and have some vampiric help of their own.This is a pretty good adaptation of the graphic novel with some changes of course. I have to say for a film that was a much lower budget from the first film it is still pretty good. I like the look and feel of this film and think that is the best thing it has going for it. The acting for the most part is good and well done. As for the vampires I must say that they turned out pretty good as well. Of course this is far from a perfect film and could have been better.Still the special features were good with the behind the scenes stuff and the commentary. Director Ben Ketai wrote this film with series creator Steve Niles and I think that is what saved this film to be honest with you.

1367785,A1SHNOU2ODKIDG,B003VRV9CW,Gregorio,"[0, 1]","I'm surprised Sony didn't give this a rotten 3D conversion and release it theatrically with inflated 3D ticket prices.  Instead they dumped it directly to video and gave it a pretty standard bluray release.  The film has a lot of problems, the worst of which is the abysmally slow pace. When the action occurs, it seems fine but never spectacular, and there are far too many sequences where there just isn't much going on.  A lame attempt at a love scene never builds to any sort of emotional connection, much less eroticism.  Lengthy talky sequences quickly elicit yawns rather than building character relationships.  I didn't think the cast was ever exactly bad, but they didn't seem to register on screen.  Bland is the word that comes to mind for just about everything in this film.  Still, to give credit where it is due, there were several decent gore effects, some nice use of footage from the far superior original film, and a decent score and sound design.  I didn't really think the film looked cheap but it is relentlessly ugly.  You will see two colors during the entire run of the film: drab browns and drab greys. Even the blood looks brown.  I know this was an artistic choice from director Ben Ketai but it was clearly overdone.The high definition transfer on blu ray looks spectacular.  You will see all of the visually uninteresting images in astonishing clarity.  There isn't a flaw anywhere in the print and grain and digital noise are nowhere to be seen.  The DTS 5.1 soundtrack is excellent as well.  Sony gives the disc a nice enough set of extras with a routine documentary, a graphic novel to screen feature (that sadly has to put copyright warnings on EVERY clip, even if the copyright warning is longer than the length of the clip!), and a mildy interesting commentary track.  You will have to jump through the usual hoops to watch the disc though, as it is exceptionally slow loading due to massive DRM and useless BDLive functionality.  After waiting through the two minute load time you will have to deal with 5 forced trailers which deny access to the MENU functions on your player and once you do get to the menu and hit play you can look forward to the endless SONY warning screens.  Expect to watch the movie about 5 minutes after you put it in your player.  The blu release also comes with a DVD copy which is a bit more useful than a digital copy I suppose.I didn't really hate this film, in fact I sort of enjoyed relaxing and taking brief snoozes throughout it. While I doubt viewer sedation was the intended effect of the film, it wasn't entirely unwelcome. Compared to the original film, it is pretty weak stuff.  Still, there are lots of films worse than this hitting theatres so I think it is at least worth a rent (or buy it for very cheap).  I'm sure there will be yet another 30 DAYS sequel, even though this one seems to be almost universally detested. It should appear on shelves with little fanfare in a year or so and then we can expect the inevitable ""high concept"" big budget remake, ""reboot"" ""reimagining for a new generation"" of the original film the following year.

1367792,A2ODFNHZF5I7R1,B003VRV9CW,"Luke ""When hello ended, you let me go...""","[0, 1]","I have been a 30 Days of Night fan for quite some time now. My first exposure to the series was through the novel 'Rumors of the Undead,' which I stumbled upon by accident. Before 30 Days of Night, I absolutely hated vampires. The vampires that I had known were Anne Rice incarnations and Twilight posers, which ultimately in my eyes brought the whole idea of vampires to a level lower than dirt. There was nothing cool about a vampire that glittered in the sunlight or vampires that are only searching for love. Where was the menace in that? Where was the undead, bloodthirsty, killing machine that a vampire was supposed to be?Upon picking up Rumors of the Undead, I had no knowledge of the 30DON franchise, and in fact thought that the book was about zombies rather than vampires. You can imagine my initial disappointment when I found out that they were indeed vampires upon my first read, but I saw something different about these vampires... They were killing machines... They were EXACTLY what I always wanted in a vampire. After that, I was hooked.Now, I own all ten graphic novels, ROTU and it's sequel, Immortal Remains, the 30DON movie novel, and the two disc edition of the first film offered at FYE. To say I am a huge fan of 30DON is a bit of an understatement, so I'm sure you can imagine how I felt when I heard that Dark Days was being adapted into a direct-to-DVD feature film. There was excitement, but moreso there was genuine fear. I was terrified that a direct-to-DVD film would somehow undermine the tone of the original film, and wipe the credibility that the first film established in reforming vampires into what they were meant to be. Plus, with the recasting of Melissa George and the terrible production stills that floated around the web, my hopes and expectations dwindled more and more.But I still gave the film a chance and I still bought it on its release date. I was pleasantly surprised, honestly, but am not going to skirt around the film's flaws. I will say, however, the $20 that Amazon is wanting for it is ridiculous. I paid $15 for it at Wal Mart and that is more than a fair price.Anyways, the screenplay is obviously an adaptation of the sequel to the first graphic novel, Dark Days. The graphic novel followed a Stella Olemaun who had written a book based on the experienced and gathered a crew to help eradicate and start war with the vampire underworld. Well, this film follows a simple Stella Oleson, who is on a mission to show people that vampires are real. She does not want war (evidenced by the first line in the film), and has no crew of hardcore vampire killers following her around. Like I said before, Melissa George was recast by Kiele Sanchez. While Kiele is no Melissa, she definitely holds her own in the role, bringing at first a bit of vulnerability, and then turns that on its head and turns her weakness into strength, ultimately saving the day. While there are some questionable lines of dialogue and some things that could have been eliminated from the film completely (i.e., the spontaneous, out-of-place sex scene), the screenplay is not bad, and fits well with the tone of the original 30DON.The atmosphere with this film, and what made the first film work so well, is where there is a major flaw. Of course we can't expect this film to be a terrifying and unnerving as the first one was. The first one took place in complete isolation in a dark month in the snow, whereas this one takes place in the bright and sunny city of Las Angeles. The fact that we are in constant daylight eliminates a great deal of the tension that is so critical to the series. Of course, it was to be expected, since the graphic novel on which this is based also took place in LA. The thing is, even when we are in complete darkness and there is the presence of vampires, it still never amounts to as much tension as the first did in any given frame. It still manages to unnerve us a bit, but not to the edge of our seats as before.Ben Ketai does an adequate job of directing, doing as much as possible with the little he had to work with. Of course this is a low budget film, but Ketai squeezes every drop he can out of everything he has. The special effects are not bad, even if a bit too rubbery at times. There's even a decent CG kill that was rather well done. The film isn't as bloody as it was heralded, but it's also not a film that would be able to air on television uncensored.The cast is a bit of a hit and miss. I normally like Diora Baird when she is in a film, but in this one, she was the weakest link. She was out of her league here, requiring a lot of genuine emotion that most everybody knew Diora couldn't pull off. She wasn't cringe-inducing, but she wasn't up to par either. Rhys Coiro was good at times and terrible at others. He often seemed a little too wooden, but more often than not he was convincing and delivered a performance he can (mostly) be proud of. Harold Perrineau was probably one of the stronger roles, although his character isn't in the film for long. He was likable and easy to root for. Mia Kirshner was excellent as Lilith, and I have always though that Mia was a beautiful woman, and she brought that 'praying mantis' quality to Lilith without even really having to try. Ben Cotton played Dane, and when I saw the first clip with Dane, I thought 'what the eff?' He was nothing like what I imagined Dane looking like, but he played the part well. Dane was kind of a dry character in the graphic novel, so Ben didn't really have to do much to make the performance convincing. Everyone else was adequate, but hardly any were memorable.Overall, the film is something that can be enjoyed if you go into it with little to no expectations. You really have to take it for what it is- a direct-to-DVD 30DON film. It isn't great, but it also isn't an atrocity or even painful to watch. It's definitely one of those movies that a 'love it or hate it' kind of thing. Personally, I enjoyed it, but that just means there's millions of others that will hate it. Take it for what it is, and you may enjoy it.",3,"Pretty decent, 3 1/2...",1287878400,"10 24, 2010",2010,6085,"['have', 'been', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'fan', 'quite', 'time', 'now', 'first',

Anyway, 30 Days of Night: Dark Days picks up a year or so after the events of the first film, with Stella (Lost vet Kiele Sanchez, replacing Melissa George) attempting to spill the truth about the vampire massacre in Barrow.  Just as it appears that she's going nowhere, she ends up teaming up with a small cadre of vampire hunters, whose sole mission is taking down the vamp queen Lilith (Mia Kirshner).  That's about it in terms of plot, as Dark Days is a fairly predictable, by the numbers horror dirge that has little of guts and ingenuity of its predecessor.  There are some blood curdling moments to be had, but the best bits about Dark Days are the flashbacks/footage from the first film.  Also featuring Harold Perrineau (another Lost vet), Rhys Coiro, horror hottie Diora Baird, and a brief turn from Ginger Snaps vet Katharine Isabelle; 30 Days of Night: Dark Days is best left on the shelf and only worthwhile for die-hard fans of the first film and/or comic.",2,"Nothing special, but what did you really expect after all?",1289865600,"11 16, 2010",2010,1076,"['direct', 'video', 'sequel', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'Did', 'really', 'expect', 'anything', 'remotely', 'special', 'honestly', 'Anyway', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'Dark', 'up', 'year', 'so', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'Stella', 'Lost', 'vet', 'Kiele', 'Sanchez', 'replacing', 'Melissa', 'George', 'attempting', 'spill', 'truth', 'vampire', 'massacre', 'Barrow', 'Just', 'going', 'nowhere', 'up', 'teaming', 'up', 'small', 'cadre', 'vampire', 'hunters', 'sole', 'mission', 'taking', 'down', 'vamp', 'queen', 'Lilith', 'Mia', 'Kirshner', 'terms', 'plot', 'Dark', 'Days', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'numbers', 'horror', 'dirge', 'little', 'guts', 'ingenuity', 'predecessor', 'are', 'blood', 'curdling', 'moments', 'be', 'had', 'best', 'bits', 'Dark', 'Days', 'are', 'flashbacks/footage', 'first', 'film', 'Also', 'featuring', 'Harold', 'Perrineau', 'Lost', 'vet', 'Rhys', 'Coiro', 'horror', 'hottie', 'Diora', 'Baird', 'brief', 'turn', 'Ginger', 'Snaps', 'vet', 'Katharine', 'Isabelle', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'Dark', 'Days', 'best', 'left', 'shelf', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'first', 'film', 'and/or', 'comic']",N/A
1367800,A1NLO4JVLEGGRJ,B003VRV9CW,New York Horror Reader,"[88, 100]","I love 30 days of night.  Everything about it.  I've read all of the comics, and really enjoyed the first film.  Though there was a difference between the first film and the first set of comics, the first film effectively relayed the horror, and creepiness the comics had.  The visuals where stunning and disturbing and the acting was brilliant.When the sequel Dark Days was announced...I was immediately excited.  I anxiously followed the production news and pre-ordered the DVD months in advance from my local DVD store.  It arrived yesterday.  First thing..if you think the DVD cover is poorly designed by looking at the picture on Amazon...wait until you see this turd in real life. It looks like a high school kids photo shop project.  But like books movies should not be judged by the cover.30 Days of Night: Night Dark Days starts out similar to the graphic novels, save for the fact that in this dvd the best looking scenes in the beginning are taken from the original movie and given as flashbacks.  The story follows Stella the sole survivor from the Barrow Alaska vampire incident while she is traveling the US giving speeches on what really happened in Barrow and trying to get people to believe the truth.  Overall the production value of this movie is very low...but that is not why it is a bad movie..as low production value in an direct to DVD horror is not unusual.  The vampires in this sequel are in no way comparable to the vampires in the graphic novel...or even those in the original movie.  Sure...they are dressed in black...and have the full set of pointed teeth ( the teeth look prosthetic..no where near as believable as the first flick)..but they are missing that 'creature from hell' feel that the vampires had in the novel and the first movie.  In this movie the vampires seem like humans dressed in Halloween costumes as the vampires from the first film.  In fact...instead of a town full of vampires like the first film...there are only maybe seven vampires in this whole mess and the vampires here act more human than any vampire in any vampire movie I've ever seen.  Instead of biting many of them choose to simply shoot their victims with guns. !!!? what?The sense of urgency and fear that the first film relayed is also lost in this film.  In fact...the characters just go from scene to scene spouting putridly boring lines to build up to a brief interaction with vampires who are not scary in the least.  This film has no...repeat no scare factor..no chills...none of what you want from a good horror.The worst part of all about this sequel is that I could not give a damn about any of the characters.  They where all played flat and there is close to no development on any of them, Ketia relies on the fact that you know Stella and that is enough for him, sadly it is not enough to make a robust story line.  The characters are not the same as they where in the novel, but in a screen adaptation that is to be expected most times...the bad thing is that Stella is so far removed from the novel version of her in ""Dark Days"" that the whole story does not make sense the way it does in the novel, and nor is the end as disturbing as it should supposed to be.I love horror, and independent film and always want to find something good in the DVDs I watch and purchase..that being said the 30 Days of Night: Dark Days does have some good editing, and some decent shots...but there is probably only one scene out of the entire film that I somewhat enjoyed and overall this movie was the one of the biggest if not the biggest disappointments I've ever had in terms of sequel follow up to a cool film.  It is this kind of mess that ruins the franchise...I doubt that we will ever see ""30 days of night: Spreading the disease""  as Dark Days is so completely terrible this franchise, sadly is probably over.",1,I've never been more dissapointed in a sequel,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,3835,"['love', '30', 'days', 'night', 'Everything', ""'ve"", 'read', 'comics', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'difference', 'first', 'film', 'first', 'set', 'comics', 'first', 'film', 'effectively', 'relayed', 'horror', 'creepiness', 'comics', 'had', 'visuals', 'where', 'stunning', 'disturbing', 'acting', 'was', 'sequel', 'Dark', 'Days', 'was', 'announced', 'was', 'immediately', 'excited', 'anxiously', 'followed', 'production', 'news', 'pre-ordered', 'DVD', 'months', 'advance', 'local', 'DVD', 'store', 'arrived', 'yesterday', 'First', 'think', 'DVD', 'cover', 'poorly', 'designed', 'looking', 'picture', 'Amazon', 'wait', 'see', 'turd', 'real', 'life', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'photo', 'shop', 'project', 'books', 'movies', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'judged', 'cover.30', 'Days', 'Night', 'Night', 'Dark', 'Days', 'out', 'similar', 'graphic', 'novels', 'save', 'fact', 'best', 'looking', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'are', 'taken', 'original', 'movie', 'given', 'flashbacks', 'story', 'Stella', 'sole', 'survivor', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'vampire', 'incident', 'traveling', 'US', 'giving', 'speeches', 'really', 'happened', 'Barrow', 'trying', 'get', 'people', 'believe', 'truth', 'production', 'value', 'movie', 'very', 'low', 'not', 'why', 'bad', 'movie..as', 'low', 'production', 'value', 'direct', 'DVD', 'horror', 'not', 'unusual', 'vampires', 'sequel', 'are', 'way', 'comparable', 'vampires', 'graphic', 'novel', 'even', 'original', 'movie', 'Sure', 'are', 'dressed', 'black', 'have', 'full', 'set', 'pointed', 'teeth', 'teeth', 'look', 'prosthetic..no', 'where', 'as', 'believable', 'first', 'flick', '..but', 'are', 'missing', ""'creature"", 'hell', 'feel', 'vampires', 'had', 'novel', 'first', 'movie', 'movie', 'vampires', 'seem', 'humans', 'dressed', 'Halloween', 'costumes', 'vampires', 'first', 'film', 'fact', 'instead', 'town', 'full', 'vampires', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'only', 'maybe', 'seven', 'vampires', 'whole', 'mess', 'vampires', 'here', 'act', 'more', 'human', 'vampire', 'vampire', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Instead', 'biting', 'many', 'choose', 'simply', 'shoot', 'victims', 'guns', 'what', 'sense', 'urgency', 'fear', 'first', 'film', 'relayed', 'also', 'lost', 'film', 'fact', 'characters', 'just', 'go', 'scene', 'scene', 'spouting', 'putridly', 'boring', 'lines', 'build', 'up', 'brief', 'interaction', 'vampires', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'scary', 'least', 'film', 'repeat', 'scare', 'chills', 'none', 'what', 'want', 'good', 'horror.The', 'worst', 'part', 'sequel', 'could', 'not', 'give', 'damn', 'characters', 'where', 'played', 'flat', 'close', 'development', 'Ketia', 'fact', 'know', 'Stella', 'enough', 'sadly', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'robust', 'story', 'line', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'where', 'novel', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'be', 'expected', 'most', 'times', 'bad', 'thing', 'Stella', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'novel', 'version', 'Dark', 'Days', 'whole', 'story', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'way', 'novel', 'end', 'as', 'disturbing', 'should', 'supposed', 'be.I', 'love', 'horror', 'independent', 'film', 'always', 'want', 'find', 'something', 'good', 'DVDs', 'watch', 'purchase..that', 'being', 'said', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'Dark', 'Days', 'have', 'good', 'editing', 'decent', 'shots', 'probably', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'entire', 'film', 'somewhat', 'enjoyed', 'overall', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'not', 'biggest', 'disappointments', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'terms', 'sequel', 'follow', 'up', 'cool', 'film', 'kind', 'mess', 'franchise', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'see', '30', 'days', 'night', 'Spreading', 'disease', 'Dark', 'Days', 'so', 'completely', 'terrible', 'franchise', 'sadly', 'probably']",N/A

You knew Stella was going to beat Lilith.  You knew the rest of the team would die.  And the second you saw them bring the burned vampires back, you knew Stella was going to try it on Eben.What you didn't know was how it would happen.  Stella popping up out of the blood was awesome.  The shocking twist at the end was just freaky.  I never read the comics so I didn't know what would happen.  Would be real interesting if there was a third one with Eben as the new leader of the vampires, fighting for the bad guys he once fought against.*Spoilers end*There were a few negatives.  Stella and Dane are good characters, Lilith is a pretty cool villain, but the three team members, as well as the FBI agent who becomes a vampire were pretty flat, empty characters.  I also really didn't like the way vampires were portrayed.  In the first movie, they're shown to be superhuman, the whole reason Eben takes the vampire blood is he can't stand against them as human.  As Steve Niles said over and over on Deadliest Warrior, they're the apex predator, supposed to have six times the strength and speed of humans, but here they're just bad guys with sharp teeth and a thirst for blood.

This direct to dvd low budget sequel just doesn't hit on any level.  Stella the only survivor of the first encounter(different actress in the part) goes around the country trying to tell people through lectures that vampires killed 98 people in Alaska and not an oil fire mishap.  I'm not sure why the highly organized vampires wouldn't just kill her for trying to expose them.

(I have since tracked down the source material, though, and realize that instead of blaming Slade, as I did in my initial review of the film, I  should have gone after Steve Niles; Slade was faithful to substandard source.) Which makes me wonder what I was even thinking watching a sequel. I might have avoided it had I read the IMDB comments, which (quite accurately) reflect the movie as derivative of Blade and Underworld, but without the quality of the former or the misguided talent of the latter.NOTE: the plot synopsis contains a major spoiler for the first film.Plot: Stella Olemaun (A Perfect Getaway's Kiele Sanchez, cast after scheduling conflicts caused Melissa George, who was to reprise her role, to drop out), one of the few survivors of the vampires' occupation of Barrow in the original film, has moved to Los Angeles with the intention of both publicizing the reality of vampires and drawing their attention to her in order to draw them out so she can get revenge for the death of her husband. She succeeds in the latter, at least, which leads to a string of bloody shoot-'em-ups. And when you have those, why would you need such niceties as plot and character development?It's too bad, because there are a number of very good actors who got duped into being in this mess (Harold Perrineau's name stands out, as does Diora Baird's), and they really deserved better than the crappy script they were given. Still, if you're a fan of action horror and you've watched the (vastly superior...even the third one) Resident Evil movies too many times, this will fit the bill.

The first movie30 Days Of Night [Blu-ray] was so fantastic that this sequel seems to have fallen flat for a lot of people.Many of the criticisms are not without merit: the actors are different, the budget is much lower, the plot is considerably looser, and the characters are less compelling.  However, there is a lot to say for this movie, especially if you enjoyed the graphic novels.  This movie shines brighter once you become invested in the very compelling world of 30 Days of Night.Start with the graphic novels30 Days of NightDark Days (30 Days of Night, Book 2)Return to Barrow (30 Days of Night, Book 3)Bloodsucker Tales, Volume 1 (30 Days of Night, Book 4) (v. 1)Three Tales (30 Days of Night, )Spreading The Disease (30 Days of Night, Book 6)Eben And Stella (30 Days of Night, Book 7)Red Snow (30 Days of Night, Book 8)30 Days of Night: 30 Days til DeathOnce you understand this fictional world, the vampire politics that Dark Days highlights comes through much more clearly.  In Dark Days, a second feast into the arctic circle is being planned.  Stella and some less-than-competent vampire hunters attempt to stop them.Dark Days fleshes out much of the mythology around the vampires of 30 Days of Night. Just what exactly can kill these vamps?  How are they organized? What kind of lifestyle do these vampires lead (no dandy vamps here)?Finally (and I wont give it away) the ending of Dark Days does finally hit the emotional notes that made the original movie such a hit.  It is a poignant ending for this movie and, again, ties the world from the original graphic novels into the films.All-in-all, if you're invested in the world of 30 Days of Night, I think you will enjoy Dark Days.  If you are simply expecting ""MORE"" of what you saw in the first movie, you will probably be dissappointed.

Sure enough, ""30 Days of Night: Dark Days"" proves to be a rather lame follow-up to an enjoyable cult horror film featuring a very unusual premise.The original ""30 Days of Night,"" based on a graphic novel, was a vampire tale with a terrific twist... the action took place in remote northern Alaska after the sun had set for the winter, and a town's inhabitants were quickly overrun by the undead who no longer had to fear impending dawn. Unfortunately, ""Dark Days"" completely discards the original film's Alaska setting and, for that matter, most of the acting talent, special effects budget, and coherence in screenwriting. All that is left is another routine vampire story with third rate TV actors going through the motions for a paycheck.The sequel's only rather tenuous tie to the original is the character of Stella Oleson, wife of the town sheriff in the original film, now played by Kiele Sanchez, who is best known for playing the universally reviled Nikki in a handful of episodes on TV's ""Lost."" This film won't boost her standing among fans of this type of entertainment. Stella now travels the country, trying to warn people that vampires do exist. To prove her point, at one Los Angeles lecture, she turns on some powerful UV lights in the auditorium and fries several of the undead who are in attendance. The buildup to and execution of that scene are quite impressive and the only reason I'm giving the film two stars. However, from the moment the UV lights go out, the movie starts to fade quickly.After attending her lecture, a group of vampire hunters convince Stella to join them in going after a colony of the blood suckers who are hiding somewhere in Los Angeles. There doesn't seem to be much method to their search, which apparently calls for them to randomly go into dark abandoned buildings and tunnels where they can easily be outnumbered and ambushed by the vampires. This strategy allows them to shoot dozens of bullets into the stunt extras playing the vampires until the hunters run out of ammunition and try to run for it. Throughout this ordeal, the actors manage to appear more hung over than scared or angry.Although the action scenes are competently staged, they aren't very scary or exciting. In fact, the film seems to lack much energy at all. I'm not sure if the director was trying to keep the film low key or not, but the net result is a movie that seems to stage the same two or three scenes over and over with little emotion until it reaches its allotted running time. The only really distinguishing features of the vampires are that they have dead black eyes and a mouth that contains about a hundred pointy little teeth, and only their queen (Mia Kershner) displays any personality. I will give the movie credit for coming up with a clever gimmick to give Stella a chance in her showdown against the vampire queen, but many viewers will be asleep well before then.""Dark Days"" certainly isn't the worst horror movie out there, but seeing it after the innovative original is a big disappointment. The film makers seem to have lost track of everything that made the original enjoyably memorable and substituted generic dreck instead. Also generic are the audio commentary on the DVD by director Ben Ketai (which consists mainly of lavishing praise on unknown local actors who, despite the director's predictions of a rosy future, are still unknowns) and a ten-minute ""making of"" featurette. Those who do watch this movie are fortunate in one regard: the film's only good sequence occurs about 15 minutes into the movie, so it's easy to remain awake through the aforementioned lecture hall scene. After that scene, however, viewer can get much more enjoyment and save considerable time by turning this movie off and watching the trailer for the original film (also included on the DVD) a few times instead.",2,Time to Turn Out the Lights on These Vampires,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,3948,"['Here', 'are', 'four', 'words', 'usually', 'signify', 'DVD', 'going', 'be', 'stinker', 'direct-to-video', 'sequel', 'Sure', 'enough', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'Dark', 'Days', 'be', 'rather', 'lame', 'follow-up', 'enjoyable', 'cult', 'horror', 'film', 'featuring', 'very', 'unusual', 'premise.The', 'original', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'was', 'vampire', 'tale', 'terrific', 'twist', 'action', 'took', 'place', 'remote', 'northern', 'Alaska', 'sun', 'had', 'set', 'winter', 'town', 'inhabitants', 'were', 'quickly', 'overrun', 'undead', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'had', 'fear', 'impending', 'dawn', 'Unfortunately', 'Dark', 'Days', 'completely', 'original', 'film', 'Alaska', 'setting', 'matter', 'most', 'acting', 'talent', 'special', 'effects', 'budget', 'coherence', 'screenwriting', 'left', 'routine', 'vampire', 'story', 'third', 'rate', 'TV', 'actors', 'going', 'motions', 'paycheck.The', 'sequel', 'only', 'rather', 'tenuous', 'tie', 'original', 'character', 'Stella', 'Oleson', 'wife', 'town', 'sheriff', 'original', 'film', 'now', 'played', 'Kiele', 'Sanchez', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'universally', 'reviled', 'Nikki', 'handful', 'episodes', 'TV', 'Lost', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'boost', 'standing', 'fans', 'type', 'entertainment', 'Stella', 'now', 'country', 'trying', 'warn', 'people', 'vampires', 'do', 'exist', 'prove', 'point', 'one', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'lecture', 'powerful', 'UV', 'lights', 'auditorium', 'fries', 'several', 'undead', 'who', 'are', 'attendance', 'buildup', 'execution', 'scene', 'are', 'quite', 'impressive', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'giving', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'However', 'moment', 'UV', 'lights', 'go', 'out', 'movie', 'fade', 'quickly.After', 'attending', 'lecture', 'group', 'vampire', 'hunters', 'convince', 'Stella', 'join', 'going', 'colony', 'blood', 'suckers', 'who', 'are', 'hiding', 'somewhere', 'Los', 'Angeles', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'method', 'search', 'apparently', 'randomly', 'go', 'dark', 'abandoned', 'buildings', 'tunnels', 'where', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'outnumbered', 'ambushed', 'vampires', 'strategy', 'shoot', 'dozens', 'bullets', 'stunt', 'extras', 'playing', 'vampires', 'hunters', 'run', 'ammunition', 'try', 'run', 'ordeal', 'actors', 'manage', 'appear', 'more', 'hung', 'scared', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'competently', 'staged', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'scary', 'exciting', 'fact', 'film', 'lack', 'much', 'energy', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'keep', 'film', 'low', 'key', 'not', 'net', 'result', 'movie', 'stage', 'same', 'two', 'three', 'scenes', 'little', 'emotion', 'allotted', 'running', 'time', 'only', 'really', 'distinguishing', 'features', 'vampires', 'are', 'have', 'dead', 'black', 'eyes', 'mouth', 'hundred', 'pointy', 'little', 'teeth', 'only', 'queen', 'Mia', 'Kershner', 'personality', 'will', 'give', 'movie', 'credit', 'coming', 'up', 'clever', 'gimmick', 'give', 'Stella', 'chance', 'showdown', 'vampire', 'queen', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'asleep', 'well', 'then', 'Dark', 'Days', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'worst', 'horror', 'movie', 'there', 'seeing', 'innovative', 'original', 'big', 'disappointment', 'film', 'makers', 'seem', 'have', 'lost', 'track', 'everything', 'made', 'original', 'enjoyably', 'memorable', 'substituted', 'generic', 'dreck', 'instead', 'Also', 'generic', 'are', 'audio', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'director', 'Ben', 'Ketai', 'mainly', 'lavishing', 'praise', 'unknown', 'local', 'actors', 'who', 'director', 'predictions', 'rosy', 'future', 'are', 'still', 'unknowns', 'ten-minute', 'making', 'featurette', 'who', 'do', 'watch', 'movie', 'are', 'fortunate', 'one', 'regard', 'film', 'only', 'good', 'sequence', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'easy', 'remain', 'awake', 'aforementioned', 'lecture', 'hall', 'scene', 'scene', 'however', 'viewer', 'can', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyment', 'save', 'considerable', 'time', 'turning', 'movie', 'watching', 'trailer', 'original', 'film', 'also', 'included', 'DVD', 'few', 'times', 'instead']",N/A
1367813,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B003VRV9CW,Sky,"[0, 0]","Back in October 2007, after the film adaptation of30 Days Of Nightcame out and received mostly negative reviews, instead of waiting for the movie on DVD, I decided to take a look at the graphic novels created by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith. It turned out that was a good move because now after seeing two movie adaptations of the three original 30 Days stories, the movies are 0 for 2 in matching the story telling that made the graphic novels so successful.Interestingly, 30 days was originally fielded unsuccessfully to movie studios as a screenplay before Niles hooked up with Templesmith to create the comic. Once the comic came out, even studios that had originally rejected the movie pitch were knocking down the 30 Days creators' doors to get the film rights (according to a 10/18/2007 IGN.com article).Anyway, when I looked up 30 Days at Amazon, I found that more than just one version existed. There is the 2002 original30 Days of Night; there is #2 calledDark Days(2003); and there is #3 calledReturn to Barrow(2004). There are even more in the series too, but the above three complete the trilogy created by the original partnership of Niles & Templesmith.30 Days of Night, the original, is the story of vampires that invade a small town (called Barrow in Alaska) at dusk on the first evening of 30 days before the sun will rise again. The second story, Dark Days, is one of revenge; a survivor of the first story hunts and seeks to expose the existence of vampires; and the third story, Return to Barrow, has the brother of a victim from the first story returning to Barrow to discover and expose the awful truth of what originally happened in the town.The film adaptation of 30 Days of Night was just ""okay""; not great...not terrible...you know, just ""good"". So my expectations for Director Ben Ketai's adaptation of Dark Days were pretty much set for a sequel that bites versus a biting sequel. And my expectations were mostly correct. According to the rolling credits, Steve Niles co-wrote the screenplay, but little of the Dark Days comic book's story-integrity is still intact; the book was much, much better. The Dark Days graphic novel followed Stella, a survivor of the original, and her plight to expose vampires' existence to the public, the vengeance that the vampires wanted to take on Stella for her role in killing a certain vampire while surviving the original 30 Days, and a potential deal that she strikes with the vampires to prevent her from going public about their existence.The movie adaptation turns into more of a horribly gone wrongPredatorswhere it's Stella and a group of rogue vampire survivors in a bang bang shoot 'em up war against vampires; there is little plot other than to find 'em and kill 'em. Fledgling Director Ketai used some character actor TV personas as a cast, bad make up and some sorry special effects (including blood that sometimes looked like grape juice and sometimes Hawaiian Punch) for a straight to DVD feature that really earns its ""straight to DVD"" stripes. There are inconsistencies throughout the film (like for some reason Stella never changes her bloodied T shirt in the movie, but throughout the movie the blood stains on the T shirt are often in different places) that make the so-so acting and fair at best movie adaptation unintentionally laughable at times.If you liked the original 30 Days movie and you didn't read the graphic novels, you might even like the Dark Days movie. And heck, I guess I was even somewhat entertained.

Lilith speaks a strange tongue with subscripts, until the very end when she can suddenly speak English. The acting wasn't all that great.

When none of the actors from the previous movie show up for the sequel, that's usually a bad sign. I should have heeded the warning. The characters in this movie become hunters. Their choice of weapons is conventional firearms and machetes...against ruthless vampires. They actually enter the vampire lairs armed with nothing but guns and machetes.
