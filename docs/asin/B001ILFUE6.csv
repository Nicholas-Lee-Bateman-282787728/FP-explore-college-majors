Amith (kndy),"[25, 28]","""Schoolhouse Rock!' makes its return just in time for Earth Day (on April 22nd) and educating children on recycling, protecting the Earth via the ocean, the rainforest and more!  ""Schoolhouse Rock! Earth"" makes a wonderful educational tool for parents or teachers wanting to educate their children through music about taking care of the planet.Back in the early 70's, an animated series known as ""Schoolhouse Rock!"" captured the attention of young Americans as it was seen on television but it became very instrumental in helping people learn about mathematics, grammar and science.The animation was from an idea based by David McCall who knew his son was having problems with multiplication tables, but his son was able to know the lyrics to the popular songs of that time.  So, what if children remembered the lyrics to songs that were educational.  McCall eventually created animated versions of the songs and they were sold to ABC for their Saturday morning lineup and for 12 years the animation was shown on television.  With the regular broadcasts ending in 2001.There have been a few new songs dealing with money and politics, especially for the release of the 30th Anniversary DVD collection of ""School House Rock"".  And in March 2009, children will get to learn the latest ""Schoolhouse Rock!"" music as this time, the theme goes Green with the release of ""Schoolhouse Rock! Earth"" to celebrate Earth Day (April 22nd).The creators of the original series have created new songs bringing back characters such as Interplanet Janet and Mr. Morton.The DVD features eleven original songs with new contemporary animation which helps children learn about global warming from a polar bear's point of view, carbon footprints from an animated Sasquatch, the importance of tropical rain forests, benefits of solar and wind power and other important ""green"" concepts.The songs featured on this DVD are:* Report from the North Pole* The Little Things We Do* The Trash Can Band* You Oughta Be Savin' Water* The Rainforest* Save the Ocean* FatCat Blue: The Clean Rivers Song* A Tiny Urban Zoo* Solar Power to the People* Windy and the Windmills* Don't Be a Carbon SasquatchThe DVD also contains an extra video titled ""The Three R's"" by ""Hannah Montana"" star Mitchell Musso and the original classic version of ""The Energy Blues"".VIDEO & AUDIO:The video is presented in widescreen with an aspect ratio of 1:66:1 (enhanced for 169 televisions) and features hand drawn animations.  Simple and similar style to the classic ""Schoolhouse Rock!"" animations from the past.  Animation that are line drawings with no major shading or detail.  Simplified animation.As for the audio, audio is presented in English via Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and a French language track.  The music comes clear via your front channel speakers and no problems with audio.SPECIAL FEATURES:Unfortunately, there are no special features.JUDGMENT CALL:The main drive for the ""Schoolhouse Rock!"" animations is to help educate children and help them remember songs and hopefully they will do well in their homework.  I can tell you that growing up with ""Schoolhouse Rock!"", songs such as ""Conjunction Junction"", ""Naughty Number Nine"", ""Electricity, Electricity"", ""I'm Just a Bill"" and ""The Preamble"" were big songs and actually did help me in quizzes for school because I remembered these songs and stuck in my head.Now as an adult, I watched these videos with my 6-year-old son and there are songs that really stuck in our heads such as ""Save the Ocean"".  In fact, I've caught him singing the song and many other songs featured on the DVD and thus I know the intention of children being educated through music and learning about ecology and protecting the Earth does work with their viewing of ""SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK! EARTH"".With Earth Day coming up on April 22nd, it's definitely good timing for the release of this DVD and I can see parents and teachers utilizing the DVD to help educate children about protecting the ocean, the rainforest and learning about recycling, solar power and windpower as well.For parents and those of us who grew up with the original, this newer DVD keeps the original feeling intact, especially since the creators of the original are involved in the making of this version.  Also, a similar style of singing (well, of course, a bit modernized as some parts have a bit of rapping) as the original.  But the music is catchy, stays in your mind and you'll find yourself singing along with your children.""SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK! EARTH"" is a very good educational tool for children and safe songs for children and their families to learn and sing along to.",4,Schoolhouse Rock!

1204574,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,B001ILFUE6,"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain...","[5, 13]","The originalSchoolhouse Rockwas the best (and perhaps the only great) example of educational television ever broadcast in this country, and as someone who grew up watching it and later watched the 30th anniversary edition DVD with his kids, I can say without fear of contradiction that it holds up remarkably well.  Thirty years from now when dishonest and/or incompetent scientists, journalists, and politicians (but I repeat myself) are spreading panic about the Coming Ice Age, this dreck will have been completely forgotten,...except by Global Cooling skeptics using it to embarrass then Global Cooling fanatics the same way Global Warming skeptics like to use the infamous April 28, 1975, Newsweek story ""The Cooling World"" to embarrass Global Warming fanatics today.Let us pass briefly over the embarrassing scientific errors: the globe hasn't warmed in 16 years, the polar icecaps are NOT melting, the seas are NOT rising, hurricanes and violent storms are NOT increasing in strength or in numbers (though we have had an intriguing number of Worst Ever Winter storms that cannot rationally be explained by Global Warming), Tsunamis are caused by EARTHQUAKES not climate, large scale solar and windmill electricity generation are both currently too inefficient to be of practical use (if you want ""green"" electricity you can actually afford, you are stuck with hydro and nuclear), in the US the air and water have never been cleaner since humans set foot here, recycling in far too many cases involves paying extra to have your ""recyclable"" garbage hauled by different trucks to different landfills (if we really wanted to do some good, we'd be building high tech, low emission, modern incinerators to eliminate most of what we currently endanger our grandchildren with by burying in the ground), thanks to technological breakthroughs in oil shale ""fracking"", we may NEVER run out of oil or natural gas, and even if ""carbon footprints"" weren't a total scam, virtually nobody watching this DVD is a Carbon Sasquatch on the order of Al Gore and the other super wealthy ""green"" hypocrites.It isn't that there is nothing worth teaching here once you strip away the scams and pseudoscience (the best argument for not wasting energy, water, and whatever else you have is that you will be saving MONEY, not the planet).  It is rather that Schoolhouse Rock made its fame in the old days with catchy songs you couldn't forget if you tried.  IMHO it's a pretty bad sign that the two catchiest songs on here are ""The Little Things We Do"" and ""Solar Power to the People"" which are both examples of new (and less memorable) words set to what are basically a couple of original Schoolhouse Rock tunes starring original Schoolhouse Rock characters, ""The Tale of Mr. Morton"" and ""Interplanet Janet"" respectively.  Ignoring the bad science, I didn't find any of the other songs remotely memorable, except of course for ""The Energy Blues"", a remastered original.If you are going to sell out, the least you can do is produce quality work.

1204576,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B001ILFUE6,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[7, 9]","When I first heard about SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK! EARTH!, I thought the DVD was a collection of existing animated songs from a series I must have missed a few years back. To my surprise and delight, it is not only a brand-new production but features a majority of the original talent behind the beloved series.Those of us who loved Saturday Morning TV remember fondly these short interstitials between the cartoons and Krofft shows, teaching math, grammar, social studies and more with catchy songs and ingratiating animation.In this new DVD, the co-creators were involved creatively (something that should happen MORE when recreating classics like this): Executive Producer George Newall and Animation Director Phil Kimmelman, as well as Producer Radford Stone. The animation looks exactly like the original series, except perhaps for some image clarity created by today's technology. The segments joined the songs feature three bears with more flowing animation; the contrast against the song segments  which only underscore the lengths taken to be true to the original series.And almost all the musical talent returned! Master trumpeter and Merv Griffin TV sidekick Jack Sheldon, whose ""Conjunction Junction"" voice is a vital part of the series legacy; Tony winning composer/lyricist/singer Lynn Ahrens, who has become one of the biggest names on Broadway (SEUSSICAL, RAGTIME) and of course, Musical Director Bob Dorough, who wrote and performed most of the songs both here and in the original. Even the great Bob Kaliban, who did voices not only for SSCHOOLHOUSE ROCK! but also co-starred on camera on the wonderful but short-lived series DRAWING POWER, returned!Some very distinguished newcomers have also joined the fold: one song is sung by Tituss Burgess, currently playing Sebastian on Broadway in THE LITTLE MERMAID. And not only do the composers of the new songs for the London and Broadway version MARY POPPINSs (Anthony Drewe and George Stiles) offer a song, George  is one of the singers.Plus, HANNAH MONTANA costar Mitchel Musso performs in a video that adds environmental lyrics to the classic Three is a Magic Number.By the way, the sound track album was released on Walt Disney Records, but only by download through iTunes or amazon.Here's hoping this is the first of many NEW DVD and soundtracks from SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK!",5,"A fantastic ""Schoolhouse"" reunion with original cast members and creative teams!",1239321600,"04 10, 2009",2009,2330,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'SCHOOLHOUSE', 'ROCK', 'EARTH', 'thought', 'DVD', 'was', 'collection', 'existing', 'animated', 'songs', 'series', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'surprise', 'delight', 'not', 'only', 'brand-new', 'production', 'majority', 'original', 'talent', 'beloved', 'series.Those', 'who', 'loved', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'TV', 'remember', 'fondly', 'short', 'interstitials', 'cartoons', 'Krofft', 'shows', 'teaching', 'math', 'grammar', 'social', 'studies', 'more', 'catchy', 'songs', 'ingratiating', 'animation.In', 'new', 'DVD', 'co-creators', 'were', 'involved', 'creatively', 'something', 'should', 'happen', 'MORE', 'when', 'recreating', 'classics', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'George', 'Newall', 'Animation', 'Director', 'Phil', 'Kimmelman', 'as', 'well', 'Producer', 'Radford', 'Stone', 'animation', 'exactly', 'original', 'series', 'perhaps', 'image', 'clarity', 'created', 'today', 'technology', 'segments', 'joined', 'songs', 'feature', 'three', 'bears', 'more', 'flowing', 'animation', 'contrast', 'song', 'segments', 'only', 'underscore', 'lengths', 'taken', 'be', 'true', 'original', 'series.And', 'almost', 'musical', 'talent', 'returned', 'Master', 'trumpeter', 'Merv', 'Griffin', 'TV', 'sidekick', 'Jack', 'Sheldon', 'Conjunction', 'Junction', 'voice', 'vital', 'part', 'series', 'legacy', 'Tony', 'winning', 'composer/lyricist/singer', 'Lynn', 'Ahrens', 'who', 'become', 'one', 'biggest', 'names', 'Broadway', 'SEUSSICAL', 'RAGTIME', 'course', 'Musical', 'Director', 'Bob', 'Dorough', 'who', 'wrote', 'performed', 'most', 'songs', 'here', 'original', 'Even', 'great', 'Bob', 'Kaliban', 'who', 'did', 'voices', 'not', 'only', 'SSCHOOLHOUSE', 'ROCK', 'also', 'co-starred', 'camera', 'wonderful', 'short-lived', 'series', 'DRAWING', 'POWER', 'returned', 'very', 'distinguished', 'newcomers', 'have', 'also', 'joined', 'fold', 'one', 'song', 'sung', 'Tituss', 'Burgess', 'currently', 'playing', 'Sebastian', 'Broadway', 'THE', 'LITTLE', 'MERMAID', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'composers', 'new', 'songs', 'London', 'Broadway', 'version', 'MARY', 'POPPINSs', 'Anthony', 'Drewe', 'George', 'Stiles', 'offer', 'song', 'George', 'one', 'singers.Plus', 'HANNAH', 'MONTANA', 'costar', 'Mitchel', 'Musso', 'performs', 'video', 'environmental', 'lyrics', 'classic', 'Three', 'Magic', 'Number.By', 'way', 'sound', 'track', 'album', 'was', 'released', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Records', 'only', 'download', 'iTunes', 'hoping', 'first', 'many', 'NEW', 'DVD', 'soundtracks', 'SCHOOLHOUSE', 'ROCK']",N/A

Once I watched it once I didn't want to watch it again.

These are part of Pop culture, an icon of the 70's and early 80's. When I saw this new SHR EARTH, it intrigued me, so I bought it. I was quite surprized when I watched it. The songs were very catchy,and the animation was great. I was glad to see that alot of the original writers, producers, singers, etc had a part in the new segments. Are the new SHR cartoons preachy, well some I guess, but hey, its for a new generation now. We grew up on the originals, and they will always be near and dear to my heart, but the new SHR is for a new generation, its a new world. Its not the 70's or 80's anymore.

Last year they released what they called the Election Collection to capitalize on the 2008 Presidential election, and it was mostly a stunted selection of classics with a single brand new cartoon. Suffice it to say that was a bit of a disappointment considering what you are getting. This time around you get all new cartoons and songs with Schoolhouse Rock: Earth.There are no recycled videos here. Everything in this DVD is newly created content that is themed around the planet Earth, its ecology and conservation. You get 12 brand new songs (plus one bonus song) in this collection. Here is the track list:1. Report from the North Pole2. The Little Things We Do3. The Trash Can Band4. You Oughta Be Savin' Water5. The Rainforest6. Save the Ocean7. FatCat Blue: The Clean Rivers Song8. A Tiny Urban Zoo9. Solar Power to the People10. Windy the Windmills11. Don't Be A Carbon Sasquatch12. The Three R's (Music Video by Mitchel Musso)Bonus Song: Energy BluesEven though the music is newly created is still holds on to that classic SHR sound. I won't go as far as say it's as good as the classics, but they do a fine enough job keeping away from ""modernizing"" the look and sound. Many of the new songs aren't as eco-preachy as you may think, and tend to give more practical ideas (for kids) on how to help ""save the planet"". This DVD is themed and the videos do link together in a way that tells a story with some polar bears used to link the videos. It kind of gets in the way of the classic feel if you ask me, but at least it's not invasive enough to get in the way of the songs.The DVD is going to be in widescreen format and the audio will Dolby 5.1 surround. Being that these are new songs the surround is a better experience than the Election Collection. Obviously this collection is for you eco-conservationists and as a tool to help teach your youngins' it will do nicely. If you love Schoolhouse Rock, but hate Earth Day then you're probably better off with just the classics. Just love Schoolhouse Rock? Well this is a tight-themed DVD, but it is new content.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[1, 6]","There's another really detailed review of this new DVD on Amazon.com so I won't rehash the details with listing of songs etc. But I will definitely add to it and add my FIVE STAR recommendation.There's a whole generation of who got through high school and college (and probably won some prizes on ""Jeopardy"" as well!) thanks to the original ""Schoolhouse Rock"" series. Now the SAME creators have put together this lively hour-long DVD with 11 all-new songs having to do with saving our environment. There's ""Saving The Ocean"" and ""Solar Power to the People"" as well, as ""The Little Things We Do"", which will have kids watching their parents and suggesting maybe it's time to turn off the lights when not in use or, just as important, ""recycle""!The graphic animation was always simple and you won't notice much difference here. It's the MUSIC that makes kids remember the facts and I'm thrilled to say that jazz legend Bob Dorough - who still plays in small clubs in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains - is back again as Musical Director. Now 86 years old - but still with his characteristic gray ponytail - he's teaching these songs and facts to what must be his GREAT-grandchildren. If the music didn't make it in these shorts, they'd be forgotten.I'm really glad Disney chose to release this DVD. It's one of the best things to come out for kids - who can share the joy of the series with their parents - since Christmas.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,It's Been Updated for a New Generation (to help them make sure there is a future),1238716800,"04 3, 2009",2009,1452,"['really', 'detailed', 'review', 'new', 'DVD', 'Amazon.com', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'details', 'listing', 'songs', 'etc', 'will', 'definitely', 'add', 'add', 'FIVE', 'STAR', 'recommendation.There', 'whole', 'generation', 'who', 'got', 'through', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'probably', 'won', 'prizes', 'Jeopardy', 'well', 'thanks', 'original', 'Schoolhouse', 'Rock', 'series', 'Now', 'SAME', 'creators', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'lively', 'hour-long', 'DVD', '11', 'all-new', 'songs', 'having', 'do', 'saving', 'environment', 'Saving', 'Ocean', 'Solar', 'Power', 'People', 'as', 'well', 'Little', 'Things', 'Do', 'will', 'have', 'kids', 'watching', 'parents', 'suggesting', 'maybe', 'time', 'turn', 'off', 'lights', 'when', 'not', 'use', 'just', 'important', 'recycle', 'graphic', 'animation', 'was', 'always', 'simple', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'much', 'difference', 'here', 'MUSIC', 'kids', 'remember', 'facts', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'say', 'jazz', 'legend', 'Bob', 'Dorough', 'who', 'still', 'small', 'clubs', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pocono', 'Mountains', 'back', 'again', 'Musical', 'Director', 'Now', '86', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'characteristic', 'gray', 'ponytail', 'teaching', 'songs', 'facts', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'GREAT-grandchildren', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'shorts', ""'d"", 'be', 'forgotten.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'Disney', 'chose', 'release', 'DVD', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'come', 'out', 'kids', 'who', 'can', 'share', 'joy', 'series', 'parents', 'Christmas.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A
