813578,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0001V6ZJI,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","There is an awful lot going for this film, but sadly, the way it is presented takes it down a notch or two for me.  I just found the construction of this film to be somewhat of a mess, and while I wanted it to engage me, and at times it is, it failed to really rally me in the way I wanted it to.  It is an effective piece that kind of falls short of truly grasping all that it could have been, beings that it carries with it some weighty subjects.The life of playwright Joe Orton is an astonishing one.Director Stephen Frears (and screenwriter John Lahr) really share all the blame in making this film less than brilliant, for the acting across the board is beyond stellar, and the crisp cinematography (from starlit skies to murky bathrooms to cramped and repressive apartments) is a true highlight.  The script is just jumbled to me and it fails to really capitalize on what it has to work with.  There are moments that really seem to float and give promise that this is going to really take off, and then it just falls flat once again.  I particularly liked the way in which Joe's demise was handled, but it is really just a brief glimpse at Frears capabilities.Frears is better than this.The most important aspect of this film is the acting, for it is the most redeeming.  Around many a cinematic circle, Gary Oldman is considered one of the most overdue actors for an Oscar nomination in who knows when.  He is an astonishing actor who has proven himself time and time again, and this is one of his crowing achievements.  He posseses a naughty sensuality that completely compliments the man that was Joe Orton and gives light to Orton's own artistic viewpoints.  His self-centered theatrics are superbly handled without any clich&eacute;d manipulations.  Alfred Molina is astonishing here.  When I first saw the film I found him to be rather annoying and obnoxious and I felt he was forced; until the end when his character seemed to click.  Upon rewatching the film I saw how his entire performance was really a stem of the inevitable, like a work reversed.  If you watch the scenes from end to beginning you can see the progression of his character (or at least the full understanding of his character) and that made me absolutely adore his performance.  The queen of the film is Vanessa Redgrave, who just oozes with absolute control as Peggy, Orton's agent.  Her scenes were some of my favorite, such a superb supporting work; never taking away from the star but never allowing us to forget she is there.Marvelous.Like I said; the acting across the board is phenomenal and some of the best work of the 80's (I'd place Molina and Redgrave on my best supporting ballot for, like, EVER).  I only wish that the remaining facets of the film met their grandeur.  It was a nice idea, but the execution leaves one wondering how this could have gone so wrong.",3,Separating performance from film leaves me unsettled...,1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,2860,"['awful', 'lot', 'going', 'film', 'sadly', 'way', 'presented', 'down', 'notch', 'two', 'just', 'found', 'construction', 'film', 'be', 'somewhat', 'mess', 'wanted', 'engage', 'times', 'failed', 'really', 'rally', 'way', 'wanted', 'effective', 'piece', 'kind', 'falls', 'short', 'truly', 'grasping', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'beings', 'weighty', 'subjects.The', 'life', 'playwright', 'Joe', 'Orton', 'astonishing', 'one.Director', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'screenwriter', 'John', 'Lahr', 'really', 'share', 'blame', 'making', 'film', 'less', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'board', 'stellar', 'crisp', 'cinematography', 'starlit', 'skies', 'murky', 'bathrooms', 'cramped', 'repressive', 'apartments', 'true', 'highlight', 'script', 'just', 'jumbled', 'really', 'capitalize', 'what', 'work', 'are', 'moments', 'really', 'seem', 'float', 'give', 'promise', 'going', 'really', 'take', 'off', 'then', 'just', 'flat', 'once', 'again', 'particularly', 'liked', 'way', 'Joe', 'demise', 'was', 'handled', 'really', 'just', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'Frears', 'capabilities.Frears', 'better', 'this.The', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'film', 'acting', 'most', 'redeeming', 'many', 'cinematic', 'circle', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'considered', 'one', 'most', 'overdue', 'actors', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'who', 'when', 'astonishing', 'actor', 'who', 'proven', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'one', 'crowing', 'achievements', 'naughty', 'sensuality', 'completely', 'man', 'was', 'Joe', 'Orton', 'light', 'Orton', 'own', 'artistic', 'viewpoints', 'self-centered', 'theatrics', 'are', 'superbly', 'handled', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'manipulations', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'astonishing', 'here', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'found', 'be', 'rather', 'annoying', 'obnoxious', 'felt', 'was', 'forced', 'end', 'when', 'character', 'seemed', 'click', 'rewatching', 'film', 'saw', 'how', 'entire', 'performance', 'was', 'really', 'stem', 'inevitable', 'work', 'reversed', 'watch', 'scenes', 'end', 'beginning', 'can', 'see', 'progression', 'character', 'least', 'full', 'understanding', 'character', 'made', 'absolutely', 'adore', 'performance', 'queen', 'film', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'who', 'just', 'absolute', 'control', 'Peggy', 'Orton', 'agent', 'scenes', 'were', 'favorite', 'such', 'superb', 'supporting', 'work', 'never', 'taking', 'away', 'star', 'never', 'allowing', 'forget', 'there.Marvelous.Like', 'said', 'acting', 'board', 'phenomenal', 'best', 'work', '80', ""'d"", 'place', 'Molina', 'Redgrave', 'best', 'supporting', 'ballot', 'EVER', 'only', 'wish', 'remaining', 'facets', 'film', 'met', 'grandeur', 'was', 'nice', 'idea', 'execution', 'one', 'wondering', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'so', 'wrong']",N/A

813581,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0001V6ZJI,Grady Harp,"[23, 26]","Stephen Frears continues to deliver extraordinary films (Dirty Pretty Things, The Grifters, Dangerous Liaisons, My Beautiful Launderette, Loving Walter, High Fidelity among others) and returning now to his 1987 PRICK UP YOUR EARS not only shows this excellent film aging well, but now it shows how keenly Frears is able to depict a period in time.  Set in the 1960s, Frears bases his story on the biography of Joe Orton (British playwright whose plays included 'Entertaining Mr. Sloane' and 'Loot').  And while many other directors and screenwriters struggle with the format of ""interviewing"" people who knew the subject versus creating a novel/story based on bits and pieces of fact and fiction, Frears uses both these approaches with consummate skill.  Joe (John) Orton (Gary Oldman in a definitive performance) was an openly gay playwright in a period of time in England when being gay was still punishable by imprisonment.  His childhood in Leicester is explored (with Julie Walters amazingly fine as his weird mother) as he wishes to become an actor. He moves to London where he becomes involved with one Kenneth Halliwell (Alfred Molina in a tour de force, over the top raging Queen role) and lives in an openly gay, albeit bizarre love/hate relationship.  The two struggle to become established as actors and writers, but it is Orton who succeeds, only after a six month prison sentence for 'indecency' during which time he writes his first play.  When Orton and Halliwell are released form prison, Orton's star ascends due in part to the wise counsel and friendship of Peggy Ramsey (Vanessa Redgrave in peak form).  Halliwell ages (he is eight years Orton's senior), resents Orton's success not only with the theater and money, but with the near daily dalliances in toilets and lurid spaces where he seeks sex. The ending of the biography is well known and opens the film, so it is not inappropriate to say that Halliwell's mind is finally broken and he bludgeons Orton to death and then commits suicide.  Only Orton's diaries are left to document his truly strange life.  Given the content of the story, it may seem to some that this is a grisly tale and it might well have been in less capable hands.  But with Frears' directorial gifts and absolutely first class performances by Oldman, Molina, Redgrave, Frances Barber, Julie Walters and the rest of the cast, this film finds humor, tenderness, meaningful insights into the artist's mind, and what life was like in England under the threat of a legal system that had changed little since Oscar Wilde's tragedy.  The cinematography and music are excellent and the flavor of the 60s is captured completely.

Gary Oldman, perfectly cast as the ill-fated playwright Joe Orton, captures precisely the spirit of what Orton and his work seem to have been about--macabre playfulness, unflappable hedonism, and an acute sense of life's absurdity.  Alfred Molina also delivers as Kenneth Halliwell, Orton's frustrated lover and literary mentor.  Vanessa Redgrave is delightful as Orton's potty-mouthed agent, one among the many courageous roles that epitomize this remarkable actress's career.Alan Bennett is, however, a verbal writer, which makes it crucial that we be allowed to hear his text.  Unfortunately, sound is an area in which this film (and many other British films of its period) fail to excel.  Visually, the film should have been good; the sets (especially Orton and Halliwell's claustrophobic one-room apartment) are a perfect fit with the story.

Having recently added it to my collection, I can confirm that it has aged well and lost none of its hilarious pungency.  There are many levels on which this film can be enjoyed.  First, it is a about gay life in an era - the 60s - when things are opening up.  This is a fascinating portrait that does not attempt to gloss over or hide the promiscuity, the occasional danger, and the never-ending search for love and sex.  It is very raw, yet funny.  Of particular interest is a sex tourism trip they take to Morocco.Second, it is about a weird relationship that combines love and need with hatred and cruelty, where one partner grows past the other who is in a downward spiral of depression and rage.  Though between two men, it is a pattern found in many troubled relationships.  Orten also comes for a strange lower middle class family, which is at times funny and very sad.Third, it is about the difficult birth of a major talent, perhaps one of the most interesting such portraits I have ever seen.  Orten starts off trying to act, then gets on the dole and more or less does what he wants, all the time studying and attempting to hone his writing.  His lover serves as a mentor, introducing him to a corpus of work and long discussion.  One of the most interesting parts of this is his relationship to a literary agent, Redgrave, who helps to manage his talent while profiting from it and enhancing her own career - it is subtle and deeply ambiguous stuff.The plot is framed by a literary investigation by Orten's biographers, one of whom is Wallace Shawn.  In her incisive manner, Redgrave is guiding the effort, which adds an additional layer to the story.  It is very clever and throws much of what is discovered into doubt.This is a true masterpiece, far better than My Beautiful Laundrette or Sammy and Rosie Get Laid.  It can be viewed many times for interesting nuggets yet remains open to interpretation.

Hebbron ""S B H.""","[2, 3]","Joe Orton was the, ""bit of rough"", Leicester lad who became the voice of edgy, sexual charged playwriting in the 60's, exactly the kind of representaions peole were seeking at the time.The film depicts his life and rise to fame beautifully, exploring his sexually charged adoloscence,his early admission to RADA, his emerging and confident sexuality and meeting with Halliwell, throught to his final success and the destruction of his realtionship with Halliwell which led to their deaths; Halliwell battered Joe to death with a hammer before overdosing himself on a barbiturate cocktail (bizarrely Halliwell died first). The casting is perfect and the lead actors are immensley evocative and emotive. There is a delicious cameo by Julie Walters as Orton's Mum, too afraid to answer the door to a theatre offical seeking Joe because she has left her teeth upstairs. Frances Barber is excellent and loyal as Joe's Sister, Vanessa Redgrave is slightly cold and bitchy as his agent, particularly with women. An excellent depiction of Joe's high octane, interesting and sadly short life, I was only sorry that the ""Morrocan Holiday"" scene did not feature a representaion of the comic actor Kenneth Williams(of ""Carry On"" fame), a dear freind of Joe's who often holidayed with Joe and Halliwell. Not an easy film but a very good and beautifully depicted one.Fnas of Joe may wish to know that Leicester City Council have now marked the council house he grew up in with a blue plaque, it is situated off Saffron Lane, an estate of houses bulit in the 1930's.",5,A great biographical representation.,1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,1551,"['Joe', 'Orton', 'was', 'bit', 'rough', 'Leicester', 'lad', 'who', 'became', 'voice', 'edgy', 'sexual', 'charged', 'playwriting', '60', 'exactly', 'kind', 'representaions', 'peole', 'were', 'seeking', 'time.The', 'film', 'life', 'rise', 'fame', 'beautifully', 'exploring', 'sexually', 'charged', 'adoloscence', 'early', 'admission', 'RADA', 'emerging', 'confident', 'sexuality', 'meeting', 'Halliwell', 'throught', 'final', 'success', 'destruction', 'realtionship', 'Halliwell', 'led', 'deaths', 'Halliwell', 'battered', 'Joe', 'death', 'hammer', 'overdosing', 'barbiturate', 'cocktail', 'bizarrely', 'Halliwell', 'died', 'first', 'casting', 'perfect', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'immensley', 'evocative', 'emotive', 'delicious', 'cameo', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'Orton', 'Mum', 'too', 'afraid', 'answer', 'door', 'theatre', 'offical', 'seeking', 'Joe', 'left', 'teeth', 'upstairs', 'Frances', 'Barber', 'excellent', 'loyal', 'Joe', 'Sister', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'slightly', 'cold', 'bitchy', 'agent', 'particularly', 'women', 'excellent', 'depiction', 'Joe', 'high', 'octane', 'interesting', 'sadly', 'short', 'life', 'was', 'only', 'sorry', 'Morrocan', 'Holiday', 'scene', 'did', 'not', 'feature', 'representaion', 'comic', 'actor', 'Kenneth', 'Williams', 'Carry', 'fame', 'dear', 'freind', 'Joe', 'who', 'often', 'holidayed', 'Joe', 'Halliwell', 'Not', 'easy', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'beautifully', 'depicted', 'one.Fnas', 'Joe', 'may', 'wish', 'know', 'Leicester', 'City', 'Council', 'have', 'now', 'marked', 'council', 'house', 'grew', 'up', 'blue', 'plaque', 'situated', 'off', 'Saffron', 'Lane', 'estate', 'houses', 'bulit', '1930']",N/A

Ostensibly a biopic of the late Joe Orton (a British playwright of some note in the Britain of the middle Sixties), the movie is really a study of a relationship. Frears, director of the classic ""Dangerous Liasions"", brings the same focus to the relationship between the lovers and how the emotional tragedy of an impending break up leads to the ultimate act of despair.Molina plays Orton's lover who eventually murders him when he realizes Orton's about to move on without him to fame and fortune.  So Molina's character bashes Orton's head in with a ""blunt object.""It's an intense study a gay relationship; surprisingly frank even for the late Eighties when just having two gay guys in bed together created a firestorm of controversy on the show ""Thirtysomething"".  As Vanessa Redgrave's character put it, ""[Molina's character] was the first wife.""  And he couldn't take it.  So as we see all to frequently, he killed his lover and then committed suicide with qualudes.Molina's edgy intensity and the honesty about gayness in the days in Britain when it was still felonious make for a gem of a movie.It also shows Oldman's huge talent--too often wasted on brain- -dead actioners like ""Air Force One.""  Still, I suppose one has to make  cash for the studios to get to do what one really wants.Molina's gravitas, and this was my first taste of it, helped to give Spiderman 2 a weight it wouldn't have had and it gives this movie a dignity and pathos that saves it from becoming a mess lurid sensationalism.",3,The movie that made me a Molina fan,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,1557,"['was', 'picture', 'made', 'fan', 'Ostensibly', 'biopic', 'late', 'Joe', 'Orton', 'British', 'playwright', 'note', 'Britain', 'middle', 'Sixties', 'movie', 'really', 'study', 'relationship', 'Frears', 'director', 'classic', 'Dangerous', 'Liasions', 'same', 'focus', 'relationship', 'lovers', 'how', 'emotional', 'tragedy', 'impending', 'break', 'up', 'ultimate', 'act', 'despair.Molina', 'plays', 'Orton', 'lover', 'who', 'eventually', 'when', 'Orton', 'move', 'fame', 'fortune', 'So', 'Molina', 'character', 'Orton', 'head', 'blunt', 'object', 'intense', 'study', 'gay', 'relationship', 'surprisingly', 'frank', 'even', 'late', 'Eighties', 'when', 'just', 'having', 'two', 'gay', 'guys', 'bed', 'together', 'created', 'firestorm', 'controversy', 'show', 'Thirtysomething', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'character', 'put', '[', 'Molina', 'character', ']', 'was', 'first', 'wife', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'So', 'see', 'frequently', 'killed', 'lover', 'then', 'committed', 'suicide', 'qualudes.Molina', 'edgy', 'intensity', 'honesty', 'gayness', 'days', 'Britain', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'felonious', 'make', 'gem', 'movie.It', 'also', 'Oldman', 'huge', 'talent', 'too', 'often', 'wasted', 'brain-', '-dead', 'actioners', 'Air', 'Force', 'Still', 'suppose', 'one', 'make', 'cash', 'studios', 'get', 'do', 'what', 'one', 'really', 'wants.Molina', 'gravitas', 'was', 'first', 'taste', 'helped', 'give', 'Spiderman', '2', 'weight', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'movie', 'dignity', 'pathos', 'becoming', 'mess', 'lurid', 'sensationalism']",N/A

If you have a problem seeing men kissing, then you might want to take a pass (or just turn your head).  I don't know.  I wouldn't trick anyone into watching this movie without letting them know that the main characters are gay--and one of them loves to pick up strange men in London public bathrooms (called ""cottages"").But this is a good movie with great performances.
