Also, my rating of 1 star is done in protest, as this is not the first time I've purchased one of these Simpsons sets only to find scratched discs -- my Season 4 set came pre-scratched, as did Season 5, which I returned only to have exchanged for ANOTHER pre-scratched set.  The same thing happened with this season: I purchased it new, took it home, and found that one of the discs was badly scracthed.  I returned it to the store, exchanged it for another NEW copy, which I then opened to find ANOTHER scratched disc.  And not just slightly scratched -- it looked like someone had run over the disc with something, it had a large abrasion on it.  At any rate, 20th Century Fox needs to do something about their quality control.  For this reason, as well as the decline in the quality of the show after this season, I doubt very much I'll be spending my money on any additional Simpsons DVD sets.",1,"I got two copies of this, both with badly scratched discs",1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,1051,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'Amazon', 'even', 'did', 'defective', 'discs', 'are', 'fault', 'manufacturer', 'not', 'retailer', 'Also', 'rating', '1', 'star', 'done', 'protest', 'not', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'one', 'Simpsons', 'only', 'find', 'scratched', 'discs', 'Season', '4', 'set', 'came', 'pre-scratched', 'did', 'Season', '5', 'returned', 'only', 'have', 'exchanged', 'ANOTHER', 'pre-scratched', 'set', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'season', 'purchased', 'new', 'took', 'home', 'found', 'one', 'discs', 'was', 'badly', 'scracthed', 'returned', 'store', 'exchanged', 'NEW', 'copy', 'then', 'opened', 'find', 'ANOTHER', 'scratched', 'disc', 'not', 'just', 'slightly', 'scratched', 'looked', 'someone', 'had', 'run', 'disc', 'something', 'had', 'large', 'abrasion', 'rate', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'do', 'something', 'quality', 'control', 'reason', 'as', 'well', 'decline', 'quality', 'show', 'season', 'doubt', 'very', 'much', ""'ll"", 'be', 'spending', 'money', 'additional', 'Simpsons', 'DVD', 'sets']",The Simpsons - The Complete Ninth Season

1027583,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B000JLQPTK,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 0]","To say that the Simpsons season 9 contained more than its share of ""just average"" shows is a bit misleading, as an average Simpsons is generally better than anything else on TV.  No, I mean that there are very few shows that are both memorable AND very funny.  Season 9 is more memorable for starting the great continuity breaks that have (after 18+ seasons) have become a hallmark of the show.  Animation, by its very nature, frees the scriptwriter to explore anything.  With this freedom comes the temptation to experiment with characters and situations.  For example, it's easy to add an enormous mountain to the outskirts of Springfield (""King of the Hill"") - even if there were never any mountains there before!  This season had a number of controversial additions to the ""canon"" of the show.  My favourite controvery was the identity theft by Armand Tanzarian, who becomes Principal Skinner (""The Principal and the Pauper"").  There is also the most blatant (to this point) disregard for continuity in ""Das Bus,"" where, at the end of the story, the kids are still trapped on a desert island.  The 1-line voiceover to resolve this ending is classic, but had the virtue of not having been done.  Social commentary becomes very prevalent in certain episodes as well, especially in the guise of ""Lisa the Skeptic"", which includes voice work by evolutionary biologist and athiest poster boy Stephen J. Gould.Of the ""classic"" Simpsons seasons (1-10), I think this one is the most obvious bridge to the early-teens seasons that were generally criticised as being unfaithful to the spirit of the show (and not as funny to boot!).  There are, however, many very funny episodes.  A complete list here is redundant, as others have listed all the episodes.  Absolute favourite episodes of mine include:""The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson"" - this episode will necessarily always be associated with 9/11 due to the prominence in the episode of the Twin Towers.  If you can get around that, it's really the best and funniest episode of the season, and one of the best in the whole series!""The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"" - It's time for Apu's arranged marriage, just as he's learning how much fun bachelor life is.  Manjula was added to the Simpsons pantheon as a recurring character, one that I have thoroughly enjoyed over the years.""The Joy of Sect"" - not on a lot of favourites lists, but I found this episode hilarious.  Homer joins a cult and Marge enlists Rev. Lovejoy and Willy to try and deprogram him.""The Last Temptation of Krust"" - not a classic because of the guest stars (including Leno and other stand-up comics), but because of Krusty's hilarious rants (and Homer's responses to them).""Trash of the Titans"" - Homer runs for sanitation commisioner, beating Steve Martin (well, a character he voiced).  Includes a classic original song about Garbage Men, with guest-performers U2 lending a hand.There are the usual slate of commentaries (although these are getting a little repetative after this many seasons; what do they even talk about in Season 18 commentaries?)  The best extras are, of course, the deleted scenes.  There's even an entire extra verse to the aforementioned Garbage Man Song.  It's certainly a better way to watch these shows than through syndication.",4,"A very good season, but with a high number of ""average"" shows",1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,3281,"['say', 'Simpsons', 'season', '9', 'contained', 'more', 'share', 'just', 'average', 'bit', 'misleading', 'average', 'Simpsons', 'generally', 'better', 'anything', 'else', 'TV', 'No', 'mean', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'shows', 'are', 'memorable', 'very', 'funny', 'Season', '9', 'more', 'memorable', 'starting', 'great', 'continuity', 'breaks', 'have', '18+', 'seasons', 'have', 'become', 'hallmark', 'show', 'Animation', 'very', 'nature', 'scriptwriter', 'explore', 'anything', 'freedom', 'temptation', 'experiment', 'characters', 'situations', 'example', 'easy', 'add', 'enormous', 'mountain', 'outskirts', 'Springfield', 'King', 'Hill', 'even', 'were', 'never', 'mountains', 'before', 'season', 'had', 'number', 'controversial', 'additions', 'canon', 'show', 'favourite', 'controvery', 'was', 'identity', 'theft', 'Armand', 'Tanzarian', 'who', 'Principal', 'Skinner', 'Principal', 'Pauper', 'also', 'most', 'blatant', 'point', 'disregard', 'continuity', 'Das', 'Bus', 'where', 'end', 'story', 'kids', 'are', 'still', 'trapped', 'desert', 'island', '1-line', 'voiceover', 'resolve', 'ending', 'classic', 'had', 'virtue', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'done', 'Social', 'commentary', 'becomes', 'very', 'prevalent', 'certain', 'episodes', 'well', 'especially', 'guise', 'Lisa', 'Skeptic', 'voice', 'work', 'evolutionary', 'biologist', 'athiest', 'poster', 'boy', 'Stephen', 'J.', 'Gould.Of', 'classic', 'Simpsons', 'seasons', '1-10', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'obvious', 'bridge', 'early-teens', 'seasons', 'were', 'generally', 'criticised', 'being', 'unfaithful', 'spirit', 'show', 'not', 'funny', 'boot', 'are', 'however', 'many', 'very', 'funny', 'episodes', 'complete', 'list', 'here', 'redundant', 'others', 'have', 'listed', 'episodes', 'Absolute', 'favourite', 'episodes', 'mine', 'include', 'City', 'New', 'York', 'vs.', 'Homer', 'Simpson', 'episode', 'will', 'necessarily', 'always', 'be', 'associated', '9/11', 'due', 'prominence', 'episode', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'can', 'get', 'really', 'best', 'funniest', 'episode', 'season', 'one', 'best', 'whole', 'series', 'Two', 'Mrs.', 'Nahasapeemapetilons', 'time', 'Apu', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'just', 'learning', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'bachelor', 'life', 'Manjula', 'was', 'added', 'Simpsons', 'pantheon', 'recurring', 'character', 'one', 'have', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'years', 'Joy', 'Sect', 'not', 'lot', 'favourites', 'lists', 'found', 'episode', 'hilarious', 'Homer', 'cult', 'Marge', 'Rev', 'Lovejoy', 'Willy', 'try', 'deprogram', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Krust', 'not', 'classic', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'Leno', 'other', 'stand-up', 'comics', 'Krusty', 'hilarious', 'rants', 'Homer', 'responses', 'Trash', 'Titans', 'Homer', 'sanitation', 'commisioner', 'beating', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'well', 'character', 'voiced', 'classic', 'original', 'song', 'Garbage', 'Men', 'guest-performers', 'U2', 'lending', 'hand.There', 'are', 'usual', 'slate', 'commentaries', 'are', 'getting', 'little', 'repetative', 'many', 'seasons', 'what', 'do', 'even', 'talk', 'Season', '18', 'commentaries', 'best', 'extras', 'are', 'course', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'even', 'entire', 'extra', 'verse', 'aforementioned', 'Garbage', 'Man', 'Song', 'certainly', 'better', 'way', 'watch', 'shows', 'syndication']",The Simpsons - The Complete Ninth Season

He gets what he wants which was a toy firetruck which he ironically sets the tree on fire along with everyones gifts. Bart then decides to get rid of the evidence and create a false story of a burglarer stealing Christmas. &#34;The Cartridge Family&#34; (One of my personal favorites) Homer buys a gun for protecting his family. Unfortunately, Homer isn't the best person to own a gun and it drives the family away.Great season to own! Although this does have a few of my top favorite Simpson episodes, it does have the one episode of the SImpsons that I don't like. &#34;All Singing, All Dancing&#34; is my least favorite episode.

1027586,A2B9Y0WXNSN17U,B000JLQPTK,doomsdayer520,"[4, 9]","After almost a decade of Simpsons perfection or near-perfection, Season 9 is the beginning of a painful era, in which the emerging weaknesses of the series became more visible than its established strengths. It would take several years for the show to recover from a mediocre team of writers and producers with a painful shortage of new ideas or subversive laughs. The key to keeping the series even partially fresh during this uneven season was to introduce new developments for some of the supporting characters, particularly Apu in ""The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons,"" Moe in ""Dumbell Indemnity,"" and Ralph in ""This Little Wiggy."" The series continued to excel by building a very well-defined cast of supporting characters,However, character development for the main Simpson family pretty much screeched to a halt this season. This goes especially for Homer, who was nearly ruined this season. Homer's endearing denseness has become simpleton stupidity, played for cheap laughs, while the writers had him committing a distressing quantity of criminal acts. Homer was also subjected to the very amateurish writing strategy of forcing him into new occupations in practically every other episode - all of which wreck the show's continuity and are then never mentioned again - including football coach, carnival worker, naval reservist, FBI informant, sanitation commissioner, and mountain climber. Throwing around transitory one-time ideas like this does constitute quality character development. Meanwhile, fans should be particularly troubled by the completely nonsensical dead-end plots in the awful ""Das Bus"" and ""King of the Hill.""This season also began a worrisome decline in production quality. For example, see the horrendous animation of the football action in ""Bart Star,"" or the sluggish choreography and music in the new segments of ""All Singing, All Dancing."" The humor's traditional sharp timing and quickness are also sadly deficient this season. The traditional subversive deep thoughts have been largely replaced by cheap guffaws, and even those are in short supply. Just try to find such low quality at any point in the series since the first season, when the team was understandably still refining the show's style. As for the ongoing writing and development of the series, there are still a few episodes in Season 9 that display the old Simpsons brilliance, like ""The Joy of Sect"" or ""Lost Our Lisa."" But by Season 9 the golden age was over, and changing production personnel can be blamed. Granted, it's amazing for a show to maintain a high standard of quality for nine years, much less eighteen out in TV land. But even the Simpsons had their ups and downs, and the downs can still be distressing to longtime fans. For collectors of the DVD series, the dark ages are upon us.

Even the animation suffers.  What a drop off from season 8 which was absolutely brilliant.1)  The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson.  This show absolutely serves notice that the quality is gone.  Not only does it trot out every tired old, uninspired cliche these guys could come up with, but check out the background animation: it's nice to see that the people who brought us Hong Kong Phooey in the 70s have again found gainful employment.  For those of you too young to know Hong Kong Phooey, check out the drawing of the two towers while Homer is keeping watch over his car (in one of the most boring and drawn out scenes in Simpson history); it looks like they were drawn by first-graders.  This is not what I've come to expect from these guys.2)  The Principle and the Pauper.  In any previous season, this would be an OK but nothing special episode--not terrible, but only a couple minor laughs.  In this season, it is the stand-out gem.3)  Lisa's Sax.  Every season has a really bad show in which one of the adults reminisces about the way things were.  In these episodes, the running joke is the kids don't care.  In reality, no one else does either.  Here's my radical thought: if you can't come up with an idea for a show, don't do one.  There is nothing of interest here.4)  Tree House of Horror.  I'll be honest: I skipped this one.  These shows are generally lame with a few exceptions in some of the earliest seasons, so what's the point?5)  The Cartridge Family.  Jokes just miss, and this show is a reminder of how good the Simpson creators were in the past and how good this show could have been if they were as creative when they were writing it as they were in earlier seasons.  Again, check out the backgrounds--the animation is very weak.6)  The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons.  Where are the conspiracy theorists when we need them?  Did someone kidnap Groening and the writers and replace them with less talented imposters?  This show is all the evidence that I need.7)  Lisa the Skeptic.  OK, the ending was funny, but the show was weak.  There were a number of good ideas that could have been funny, but the writers did not deliver.So what's the point of continuing?  If you loved the first eight seasons, you will either love this season because you are in denial at how far the show has fallen and how rapidly, or you will hate this season and pretend, as I will, that the Simpsons went off the air, gracefully, after season eight.",2,What a Drop-Off,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,2577,"['not', 'last', 'great', 'Simpsons', 'season', 'tired', 'apparently', 'writers', 'producers', 'just', 'stopped', 'caring', 'Even', 'animation', 'suffers', 'What', 'drop', 'season', '8', 'was', 'absolutely', 'brilliant.1', 'City', 'New', 'York', 'vs.', 'Homer', 'Simpson', 'show', 'absolutely', 'notice', 'quality', 'gone', 'Not', 'only', 'trot', 'out', 'tired', 'old', 'uninspired', 'cliche', 'guys', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'check', 'out', 'background', 'animation', 'nice', 'see', 'people', 'who', 'brought', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Phooey', '70s', 'have', 'again', 'found', 'gainful', 'employment', 'too', 'young', 'know', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Phooey', 'check', 'out', 'drawing', 'two', 'towers', 'Homer', 'keeping', 'watch', 'car', 'one', 'most', 'boring', 'drawn', 'out', 'scenes', 'Simpson', 'history', 'were', 'drawn', 'first-graders', 'not', 'what', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'guys.2', 'Principle', 'Pauper', 'previous', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'OK', 'nothing', 'special', 'episode', 'not', 'terrible', 'only', 'couple', 'minor', 'laughs', 'season', 'stand-out', 'gem.3', 'Lisa', 'Sax', 'Every', 'season', 'really', 'bad', 'show', 'one', 'adults', 'reminisces', 'way', 'things', 'were', 'episodes', 'running', 'joke', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'reality', 'one', 'else', 'Here', 'radical', 'thought', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'one', 'nothing', 'interest', 'here.4', 'Tree', 'House', 'Horror', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'skipped', 'one', 'shows', 'are', 'generally', 'lame', 'few', 'exceptions', 'earliest', 'seasons', 'what', 'point', '5', 'Cartridge', 'Family', 'Jokes', 'just', 'miss', 'show', 'reminder', 'how', 'good', 'Simpson', 'creators', 'were', 'past', 'how', 'good', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'were', 'as', 'creative', 'when', 'were', 'writing', 'were', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Again', 'check', 'out', 'backgrounds', 'animation', 'very', 'weak.6', 'Two', 'Mrs.', 'Nahasapeemapetilons', 'Where', 'are', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'when', 'need', 'Did', 'someone', 'kidnap', 'Groening', 'writers', 'replace', 'less', 'talented', 'imposters', 'show', 'evidence', 'need.7', 'Lisa', 'Skeptic', 'OK', 'ending', 'was', 'funny', 'show', 'was', 'weak', 'were', 'number', 'good', 'ideas', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'writers', 'did', 'not', 'deliver.So', 'what', 'point', 'continuing', 'loved', 'first', 'eight', 'seasons', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'season', 'are', 'denial', 'how', 'far', 'show', 'fallen', 'how', 'rapidly', 'will', 'hate', 'season', 'pretend', 'will', 'Simpsons', 'went', 'air', 'gracefully', 'season', 'eight']",The Simpsons - The Complete Ninth Season

Rupert,"[0, 1]","The Simpsons - The Complete Ninth SeasonI don't watch many new episodes of ""The Simpsons"" (I feel that it stopped being funny during Season 11, but I'll save that for a forum discussion), but I can never get enough of the older episodes and the ninth season still brought the laughs. The writing was a little different and so were the jokes but the characters were so well developed that the stories wrote themselves. If there were any joke that I didn't find funny, it's because I tried to compare it to older episodes. The reality of it all is that if you laughed at these episodes back then, you'll laugh at them now. There's no need to analyze this season. Why would you anyway, it's ""The Simpsons"", you're not supposed to think while you watch this!The DVD format is great as it usually is. I don't know about anyone else, but I love the menu setups for their sets, including this one. The animation there is great.

While this has presented problems in more recent seasons, it was a fresh idea in Season 9 and it works beautifully.  Also, the addition of guest stars like Joe Nameth and Bill Gates, among others, was a great addition to the show.  In more recent episodes, the entire 30 minutes has been spoiled with guest stars, but in Season 9, the guests began appearing just long enough to mix things up.Season 9 is also heavy on clever political satire, which is never bad.  I took an American civics class several years ago and the teacher showed several episodes from Season 9 as part of the course curriculum. This season is also the most quotable, including Homer's gem ""Animals are crapping in our houses and we're picking it up!  Did we lose a war?  That's not America!  That's not even Mexico!""How can you improve on that?

1027596,A3VYWO086298U2,B000JLQPTK,"Jack Ace Rothstein ""Jack Ace""","[238, 265]","Mike Scully's reign of terror has begun!There is a theory that the best seasons of the Simpsons are its single-digit seasons. While I feel that Seasons 10 and 11 are certainly respectable, it is true IMO that Season 9 is the last season in which one could consider the Simpsons truly great.As great a writer as John Schwartzwelder had become over the seasons, Season 9 is where Ian Maxtone-Graham really shined through with not only three great episodes but also having two of the three that should be in the discussion of the greatest Simpsons episodes of all time. Here are the episodes for your enjoyment.1. The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson - classic Simpsons episode written by Ian Maxtone-Graham where Homer goes to NY to recover his illegally parked car from the WTC. Definitely one of the great Simpsons episodes of all time. Also the introduction of Duffman OH YEAH!2. The Principal and the Pauper - the somewhat controversial episode where Principal Skinner ISN'T Principal Skinner but am impostor. Later parodied in Season 11.3. Lisa's Sax - a flashback episode centered around (you guessed it)4. Treehouse of Horror VIII - Homega Man - Homer discovers after a nuclear explosion that he is the last man in Sspringfield, Fly vs. Fly - Bart uses a Frink device to morph into a man-fly, Easy Bake Coven - it's easy to see Patty and Selma as witches, but Marge too (check out the end where Homer goes as Princess Kashmir on Halloween).5. The Cartridge Family - great John Schwartzwelder episode about the folly of allowing Homer Simpson his 2nd Amendment rights. Also, the folly of believing that soccer is an enjoyable sport to watch.6. Bart Star - Bart goes for pee-wee football with Homer (looking stylish in his Tom Landry hat) as his inept but loving coach. BTW,  You're  cut.7. The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons - another great episode centered around Apu and his Indian background which now focuses on his arranged marriage and Homer's attempts to stop it.8. Lisa the Skeptic - Probably the first time on the Simpsons that someone from academia gave a voice-over (Steven Jay Gould). A decent Lisa and Marge episode.9. Realty Bites - The introduction of Gil, the lovable loser, and Cookie Kwan (stay away from the East Side) as well as Marge's attempts to be a realtor with integrity. Another great Lionel Hutz performance by the late Phil Hartman.10. Miracle on Evergreen Terrace - Average Christmas episode with Bart burning down the presents on accident and claiming burglars stole them. The best word to describe this episode: craptacular!11. All Singing, All Dancing - an above-average clip-show where the cast sings their dialogue.12. Bart Carny - Another John Schwatzwelder script where carnies trick the Simpsons out of house and home.13. The Joy of Sect - Springfield falls into the grip of a cult, except for Marge who manages to escape and plot the survival of the family. Plus another glimpse of Flanders' rumpus room.14. Das Bus - ""Lost"" completely ripped off its plot from ""Das Bus"" (which ripped it off from Lord of the Flies). Also a great B-story with Homer the burgeoning internet millionaire (""They got the internet on computers now"").15. The Last Temptation of Krust - So many great comedic guest stars fill this episode where Krusty attempts to reinvent his comedy act into that of Lenny Bruce and George Carlin. But can you really turn a corporate shill into a ""funny man of the people""?16. Dumbbell Indemnity - Probably the first full episode centered on Moe Syslack and his failed attempts to woo the opposite sex through money. MUST KILL MOE! WHEEEEEEE!17. Lisa the Simpson - A truly great Lisa episode of the quality of ""Lisa the Vegetarian"" two seasons earlier. Lisa believes she is succumbing to the dreaded Simpson gene that should cause the smart Lisa to turn dumb and dull. Another great Troy McClure in a documentary performance by the late Phil Hartman and a great performance by Dan Castellaneta as the various Simpsons adults in the tri-state.18. This Little Wiggy - Oh Ralph, that often misunderstood lad. When he is set up on a play-date with Bart, watch as the sparks fly (Smells like hotdogs).19. Simpson Tide - Homer commanding a nuclear sub? (It's pronounced ""nukular""). And all for joining the Naval Reserve. In an ""unrelated"" story, Bart tries to get an earring.20. The Trouble with Trillions - A great episode by Ian Maxtone-Graham where Homer's tax troubles cause him to become an IRS snitch, eventually facing Mr. Burns who ""acquired"" a trillion dollar bill.21. Girly Edition - Lisa's attempts at creating a serious kids news show are thwarted by Bart's neverending stream of bleeding heart human interest stories.  Also the introduction of the Crazy Cat Lady.22. Trash of the Titans - Yes, it has arrived the 200th Simpsons episode and what a gem written by Ian Maxtone-Graham. This episode had U2 (playing themselves, esp. Bono as his truly altruistic self) and Steve Martin as the incredibly competent sanitation commissioner Ray Patterson. Homer's disappointment with the sanitation department causes him to run a sleazy but successful campaign against Ray Patterson. Again, an episode that deserves to be in the discussion of the greatest Simspons episodes ever. This episode won an Emmy and was dedicated to the late Linda McCartney.23. King of the Hill - Another episode by John Schwartzwelder where Homer's lack of energy causes him to work out until he sees the ultimate challenge, climbing the Murderhorn mountain. But what I will always remember are the sherpas.24. Lost Our Lisa - A decent Homer-Lisa episode where Lisa tries to go by herself to the museum to see the Egypt exhibit.25. Natural Born Kissers - Over the years, Homer and Marge have found that it gets harder and harder to ""Rock the Casbah"". That is unless they are caught in a dangerous and perilious situation which becomes their aphrodisiac.This season has a lot of great episodes. Probably not the greatest Simpsons season of all, but definitely the last great Simpsons season. Plus you get audio commentary on EVERY episode as well as those other extras that fans of the DVDs have come to expect.",5,THE last great Simpsons season,1161907200,"10 27, 2006",2006,6139,"['Mike',

1027604,A3ATD1VNKRQ23C,B000JLQPTK,Mr. Howell,"[0, 0]","Another great classic season of The Simpsons, from when the show was still at it's creative best!There is one thing I do not appreciate: I LOVE the commentaries that accompany EVERY episode- as you can imagine, the people who are responsible for making The Simpsons, are quite entertaining and informative. Having these commentaries is like getting double the value for your money, because the commentaries are as good as the actual show; and over the years, I've actually watched the commentaries multiple times. So what's my complaint, you may ask?My complaint is that Yeardley Smith is on more commentaries in this season than any other thus far! Don't get me wrong, I love what Yeardley does with the Lisa character- I think she is great as a voice actress.....BUT (and I'm sorry to say) the woman is a dolt! All she seems to do on the commentaries, is ask idiotic questions. It's as if one of the other commentators brought in their 5 year-old daughter!Sheesh! We listen to these commentaries to learn what goes on behind the scenes, and to be entertained by the witty people who make this show. Listening to a grown woman, who is actually involved in the show, ask the other crew members idiotic questions that even children know the answer to, is just a waste, and an embarrassment.I mean no disrespect, but it's the truth. For goodness' sake, if anyone connected with the show should happen to read this, PLEASE, for the love of Gawd,  DON'T have Mrs. Smith on future commentaries- if for no other reason than to preserve her dignity!I'm sure I can't be the only one who feels this way. If others reading this agree with me, please add a comment. Thanks.Everything else about this season is a &#34;10&#34;! Buy it! It's a classic that will endure for many years.

But as with previous seasons, there is a lot more to enjoy.Let's start with the box itself:  each of the four discs look like a mock LP, with such names as Cowabunga Records and Atomic Records (with three-eyed fish logo).  Then there are the six postcards, each with different art, including parodies of the album covers for Abbey Road and Nevermind.  The music theme continues in the program booklet which includes ads for a Disco Stu CD and King Toot's Music Store.Then there are the episodes.  I won't review them all, but a few of note include the season premiere episode, ""The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson"" which pokes fun at the Big Apple; this episode would be temporarily put out of circulation after 9/11 due to its depiction of the World Trade Center.  In ""Lisa's Sax"", we learn how Lisa got her sax and Bart got his attitude.  In ""The Joy of Sect"", the family joins a UFO cult.  ""Girly Edition"" satirizes TV news when Bart's shallow human interest stories trump Lisa's fact-filled news.  ""Trash of the Titans"" (the 200th episode) features Steve Martin and U2 and has Homer becoming Sanitation Commissioner; other guest stars this season include Jay Leno, Brendan Fraser, Martin Sheen, Joe Namath, Jim Varney, Helen Hunt, Bob Denver, Alex Trebek and Phil Hartman.There's a reason that the Simpsons have lasted nearly 20 years, namely because it's so well-written.  Even the so-so episodes are better than most comedies at their best.  But this season has all good-to-great episodes, each with commentary.  There are also plenty of deleted scenes and a few other extras.

1027608,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B000JLQPTK,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[3, 4]","I used to think that season 9 was the season that The Simpsons started motoring up that ramp towards the shark.  After watching this 4 DVD set, however, I found a lot of very good episodes, especially the ones featuring Lisa which is probably why she got the cover to this set.  I like the old record label theme to the pacakaging.  I prefer the box packages to the head shaped ones as I think they are cooler looking and a little easier to work with.  The ramp might have been under construction, but this was not the season The Simpsons jumped the shark.  DVDs contain the usual commentaries and deleted scenes.Disc 1:""The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson"": Barney abandons Homer's car in the city he despises the most: New York City.  When Homer takes his family to retrieve the vehicle, they experience the best the city has to offer while Homer experiences the worst""The Principal and the Pauper"": Strange episode where the Simpsons started getting more outlandish storylines.  It turns out that Seymour Skinner stole his identity from his Army Sergeant thought to be dead.  Skinner's mother's acceptance is actually rather believable but how the town reacted to the revelation (what the real Skinner did to receive such scorn is unclear) is almost silly.  The judge was right; this episode should never be spoken of again.""Lisa's Sax"": One of my favorites.  A story about how Lisa got her saxophone (or ""saxomaphone"" as Homer calls it) turns into a cute flashback story about how Bart became a proud underachiever.""Treehouse of Horror VIII"": One of the better Halloween specials. ""The Homega Man""--Mayor Quimby offends the French and Homer thinks he's the sole survivor of the resulting neutron blast, until he's encountered by zombies. ""Fly Vs. Fly""--Bart uses a Professor Frink's transporter to morph with a fly.  I like when the spider shakes his fists at Bart the prankster fly and when monster Bart is choking Lisa in the kitchen and Homer is seen in the background using the transporter to get a beer out of the fridge.  ""Easy-Bake Coven""--Marge and her sisters turn out to be real witches in 1649 Sprynge Fielde.""The Cartridge Family"":  A soccer riot causes Marge to be concerned about the safety of her family so Homer gets a gun but is so irresponsible with it that Marge feels even less safe.  Homer is very over-the-top here.""Bart Star"":  Homer becomes coach of Bart's peewee football team and gives him special treatment.  Joe Namath is guest.Disc 2:""The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"":  Just when the single women of Springfield discover Apu as a hot bachelor, he is summoned to an arranged marriage.  He tries to get out of it by pretending to be married to Marge.  Very funny.  When Apu's mother falls outside the Kwiki Mart, Apu is relieved that it buys him time.  Homer thinking about a yodle he ate and forgetting to tell Marge about the plan is hilarious.""Lisa the Skeptic"":  Interesting episode.  Honor students are rewarded and detention students are punished with an archeological dig where Lisa discovers a skeleton that looks like an angel.""Reality Bites"":  Homer buys Snake's beloved sports car at a police seized-property auction and Snake wants revenge.  Meanwhile, Marge becomes a Realtor and sells the Flanderses the town murder house.  Stupid ending.""Miracle on Evergreen Terrace"": Bart burns down the family Christmas presents and plastic tree and makes up a story about being robbed.  The town supports them until they find out it's a hoax.  Guest Alex Trebek.  OK in parts but silly in others.  Goes all over the place.""All Singing All Dancing"":  Clips of past musical numbers. Totally lame.""Bart Carny"": Homer takes in a couple of carnies down on their luck and they help themselves...to the Simpsons' home.  Special guest: Jim Varney.""The Joy of Sect"": Homer, and most of Springfield, join the Movementarians.  ""Church, cult, cult, church.  So we get bored someplace else every Sunday.  Does this really change our day-to-day lives?""--Bart.Disc 3:""Das Bus"": A take-off of Lord of the Flies where Bart and his classmates are stranded on a deserted island.""The Last Temptation of Krust"": When his nightclub act is a bust, Krusty the Clown decides to retire until he finds out that criticizing other comics and money-grubbing companies will reinvent his career.  Comedy, however, turns out not to be what's really in his blood.  Guests include Jay Leno, Janeane Garofalo, Bobcat Goldthwait.""Dumbbell Indemnity"":  Mo finally finds a woman who will go out with him but resorts to deception and fraud to keep her.  Not one of my favorites.""Lisa the Simpson"":  The best episode of this season.  Lisa is puzzled by a kid's puzzle and freaks out when grandpa tells her about the Simpson gene that causes Simpsons to go through a process of ""dumbening.""""This Little Wiggy"":  Marge sets up a playdate for Bart--Ralph Wiggum.  Bart and Ralph get hold of Police chief Wiggum's master key and use it to turn on an electric chair at an abandoned prison.  Coincidentally, Mayor Quimby decides to reopen the prison and use the chair for a publicity stunt.""Simpson Tide"": Homer and his pals join the Naval Reserve and is put in charge by his captain (Capt. Tennille ha, ha), shoots his captain out a torpedo tube, and takes his sub into Russian waters.  Yeah, it's as stupid as that.  Guests voices: Bob Denver, Rod Steiger.""The Trouble With Trillions"": After a severe audit, Homer is hired by the IRS to help convict Mr. Burns for stealing a trillion dollar bill from the government.Disc 4:""Girly Edition"": Lisa and Bart co-anchor a kid's news TV show and Lisa thinks Bart's manipulative ""Bart's People"" segments are jeopardizing the integrity of the show.  Meanwhile, Homer gets a helper monkey who turns out to be as fat and lazy as he is.  ""But what do you expect?  His cholesterol is through the roof!"" Better than average episode.""Trash of the Titans"":  200th episode.  Why that is so important, I don't know.  Homer gets into a fight with the garbage men and they cut off his service.  Homer takes on the city and campaigns to become Sanitation Commissioner. ""It's just like David and Goliath, only this time David's going to win.""  U2 makes appearance.  Crying Indian at the end for us Generation Xers.""King of the Hill"": Another of the better episodes.  After being humiliated in front of Bart during a church picnic game of capture the flag, Homer starts working out and eating Powersauce bars.  For a Powersauce promotion, Homer attempts to climb the Murderhorn.  Highlight--The Commi-Nazi logo in the McBain movie.""Lost Our Lisa"": Lisa really wants to see the Isis exhibit at the museum but no one will drive her.  She decides to take the bus alone and gets lost.  Touching father/daughter ending.""Natural Born Kissers"": Homer and Marge try to spice up their marriage by getting romantic in forbidden places.",4,"""Keep looking shocked and move slowly towards the

1027609,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000JLQPTK,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[22, 32]","As the Simpsons reached it's landmark ninth season, by the time the last few episodes came around, it was clear that perhaps there was a decline happening in the series' quality.  The season starts out great however with the classic ""City of New York VS Homer Simpson"", as Homer and the family go to New York to recover Homer's illegally parked car.  That episode is followed by the somewhat controversial ""Principal and the Pauper"" in which it is revealed that Principal Skinner isn't Principal Skinner, but an imposter, when the real Skinner (voiced by Martin Sheen) returns to Springfield.  The ""Treehouse of Horror"" episode this season is a bit disappointing (it just doesn't have those laugh out loud moments that previous ones had), and also throughout this season, Bart tries out for the Homer coached Pee-Wee football team, Apu (Hank Azaria) worries over his arranged marriage, Bart accidently burns up the presents and blames it on made up burglars, and Mr. Burns takes a trip to Cuba with a trillion dollar bill.  The standout episodes of this season are undoubtadly ""Bart Carny"" where Homer and Bart get scammed by carnies (one of whom is voiced by the late Jim Varney), and ""The Little Wiggy"" in which Ralph gets set up on a ""play date"" with Bart.  The landmark 200th episode, ""Trash of the Titans"", features Steve Martin and U2, but this where you can notice a decline in the show's quality.  The season closer, ""Natural Born Kissers"", isn't all that great either sadly, but the good does outweigh the bad here with this season set.  All in all, for the most part the ninth season of the Simpsons is the same kind of tongue in cheek humor that you would come to expect, and it's worth picking up for longtime fans of the long running show.",5,One of the last great seasons of a legendary show,1165363200,"12 6, 2006",2006,1752,"['Simpsons', 'reached', 'landmark', 'ninth', 'season', 'time', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'came', 'around', 'was', 'clear', 'perhaps', 'was', 'decline', 'happening', 'series', 'quality', 'season', 'out', 'great', 'however', 'classic', 'City', 'New', 'York', 'VS', 'Homer', 'Simpson', 'Homer', 'family', 'go', 'New', 'York', 'recover', 'Homer', 'illegally', 'parked', 'car', 'episode', 'followed', 'somewhat', 'controversial', 'Principal', 'Pauper', 'revealed', 'Principal', 'Skinner', ""n't"", 'Principal', 'Skinner', 'imposter', 'when', 'real', 'Skinner', 'voiced', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Springfield', 'Treehouse', 'Horror', 'episode', 'season', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'out', 'loud', 'moments', 'previous', 'ones', 'had', 'also', 'season', 'Bart', 'out', 'Homer', 'coached', 'Pee-Wee', 'football', 'team', 'Apu', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'Bart', 'accidently', 'up', 'presents', 'made', 'up', 'burglars', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'trip', 'Cuba', 'trillion', 'dollar', 'bill', 'standout', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'undoubtadly', 'Bart', 'Carny', 'where', 'Homer', 'Bart', 'get', 'scammed', 'carnies', 'one', 'whom', 'voiced', 'late', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'Little', 'Wiggy', 'Ralph', 'set', 'up', 'play', 'date', 'Bart', 'landmark', '200th', 'episode', 'Trash', 'Titans', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'U2', 'where', 'can', 'notice', 'decline', 'show', 'quality', 'season', 'closer', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Kissers', ""n't"", 'great', 'sadly', 'good', 'outweigh', 'bad', 'here', 'season', 'set', 'most', 'part', 'ninth', 'season', 'Simpsons', 'same', 'kind', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'humor', 'would', 'come', 'expect', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'longtime', 'fans', 'long', 'running', 'show']",The Simpsons - The Complete Ninth Season

The characters and environments are created in a very surreal yet very realistic way like no other cartoon or even comic book series before. The show spawned 8 awesome seasons that took animation and American pop culture to different heights. However the mild profanity, moral stories and Springfield world started to get tame and dry by the 8th season and wasn't used as creatively as in the previous 7 seasons. Some say it was that the creators ran out of ideas  or it could have been the time era that made it dated, as cartoons around the same time as this season such as Duckman, South Park, and later on Family Guy were taking over with more progressive, creative and entertaining storylines and content than the Simpsons.

My parents gave me this season for Christmas, and it's downright great. Like the previous 8 seasons, it's filled with celebrity guests (one of them happens to be U2), funny one-liners, and plenty of ""D'ohs"" from Homer. In this episode, we get to see Homer's beef with New York, Lisa finding an angel in a construction site (which turns out to be a publicity stunt), Homer entering the navy, and even Apu getting married (who eventually cheats on later in the series)! This season also introduces Dufman and Gil, 2 of the best ""side"" characters in the series. In the Halloween episode, we what Homer does when he finds out he's the last person on Earth (which is dancing around nude), what would happen if Bart's body got switched to a Fly's, with his body having a fly's head after a failed experiment in teleportation devices Homer bought at Professor Frink's yard sale (""I'll teach you to mess with my machine!""), and we're finally taught that Marge IS a witch (""Well I'll be a son of a witch!"")! My favorite episode on the season, though, would have to Simpson Tide, where Homer becomes in charge of a nuclear sub (""it's pronounced nukular!""), and uses Bart's ear piercing to plug the leak in the sub (Bart: ""Didn't you ever do anything outragous when you were a kid?"" Homer: ""Well, when I was 10 I pierced my ear, but this is completely different!"").Overall, get this if you're a Simpsons fan.

1027617,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B000JLQPTK,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[22, 53]","I have been saying it since my review of season 7 - this show had seven stellar years, two more years of holding on by the fingertips, and then zippo, zilcho, crappo.  This is the last year that I can justify buying, mainly for the great Halloween episode (the last great Halloween episode).  Actually, this season somehow managed to have some better episodes than season 8 had - such as Homer joining the NRA and using his gun as an everyday household tool - or the story of Lisa's sax, which is REALLY the story of how Bart went bad - or Homer and Ned Flanders taking turns coaching the pee-wee football team - the kids going ""Lord of the Flies"" on an uncharted desert isle - and the finale which finds Homer and Marge only becoming enamored when on the verge of being caught ""doing it.""  These episodes are worth the price of admission.  Unfortunately, the bulk of the season is filled with ""kill me, please"" episodes such as Homer joing the Navy and commanding a sub . . . Homer becoming an exercise guru . . . Homer fighting the circus carnies . . . Homer joining a cult . . . yes, this is where the ""Homer does it all"" episodes really kicked into high gear.  The ""Super-Homer"" nature of the later seasons is what really killed the show, in my opinion.I remember watching the premiere episode, in which the family visits New York, with my wife the night it first aired.  After thirty minutes of NOT ONE LAUGH, we looked at each other and agreed that the show was near its end.  The following week saw the incomprehensibly asinine episode in which Skinner learns he isn't really Skinner.  I think my wife quit at this point.  Though there were a few good episodes, as I noted, this one-two punch of suck at the beginning of the season just stole all our interest in continuing the show (which we officially disbanded in early Season 10 - and never looked back).So, 9 years seems to be the magic number for TV - the really great shows hang their hat at or before 9 (X-Files, Raymond, Seinfeld . . .) - I don't know why so many people are still watching this sad excuse for entertainment.  I don't know why they couldn't just end it and go out on the high note that was Season 7 (or even Season 9).  But, money is money, and execs will stretch anything good out too thin as long as it is  making money (see also LOST) - or cancel something great the second it stops making money (see also INVASION and FIREFLY).  But, I digress . . .Bottom line, if you were a fan from Season 1, this is about the last year you will find any hint of the brilliance the show once had. I would avoid purchasing any more sets after this one.",3,"Here we are, folks - the end of the show!

But this season produced some of my favorite classic episodes.  Just to names a few, it begins with a bang when the family travels to New York to retrieve their ilegally parked car.  Other stand outs are the one where Homer buys a gun and uses it for everything (open a beer, turn on the tv), and when their house gets taken over by carnies, as well as the one where the kids are stranded on an island Lord of the Flies style.My least favorite episode would have to be ""All Singing, All Dancing"", a clip episode featuring old songs on the show, and where they sing for the entire episode.

Of course, you'll find all of Season 9's fantastic episodes, like the one where Homer and family head to New York to get Homer's car, one they never show on air anymore since the tragedy on September 11th. You'll also find the one with the Movementarians cult, the one where Bart & Homer become carnies, the one where Homer becomes sanitation commissioner, and the one where Apu gets married, just to name a few. There's also tons of deleted scenes and fun extras to play with.

Apu's wedding was quite amusing, esp. w/Jan Hooks and Andrea Martin providing some support.

1027625,A55TEBW8H4PYN,B000JLQPTK,Trevor R. Raichura,"[3, 3]","Like many other reviewers, I believe this is the beginning of the end for the Simpsons' run of greatness. In all honesty, the show was not consistently funny until Season 4, when the writers started focusing more on Homer, and less on Bart, who was getting rather predictable. Season 9 treats us to Homer at his finest in some episodes, but also fails to fully exploit his stupidity in some episodes, and uses it too much in others. Still, the truly funny episodes make up for the forgettable ones. Here are some of my favourite episodes, along with a brief synopsis, and perhaps even a favourite line or two:The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson: When Barney illegally parks Homer's car at the foot of the World Trade Center, the Simpsons take a trip to the Big Apple. ""Ewwww, ech, I'll have a crab juice.""The Cartridge Family: After a soccer riot spills over into the entire city, Homer buys a gun to protect his family. (Waiting is the Hardest Part by Tom Petty - pretty awesome sequence)Bart Star: Homer coaches Springfield's Pee-Wee football team, and makes Bart the starting QB despite his ineptitude. Homer cuts the entire crew of the show while credits roll. Hilarious!The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons: Apu just starts to enjoy life as a bachelor, when his mother reminds him of his imminent arranged marriage. In a desperate attempt to deceive his mother, Apu pretends to be married to Marge. ""What's with the dot on your forehead, does it change colours when you're angry?""Bart Carny: Jim Varney guests as a carny in this episode, in which Bart and Homer work at the carnival, but wind up losing the Simpsons' home.The Joy of Sect: Homer joins a cult (oops, sect) but Marge uses beer to bring him back to reality. How's that for irony?Das Bus: A Springfield Elementary field trip goes awry and the kids wind up shipwrecked on an island, without adult supervision. Homer attempts to start up his own internet business. ""They have the internet on computers now!""The Last Temptation of Krust: A washed-up Krusty the Clown rejuvenates his career with a new ""street"" image. But can the king of cheesy merchandise resist the temptation of corporate sponsorship? ""Don't you hate pants?""Dumbbell Indemnity: Moe finds a woman who is willing to put up with his sweat and lack of tact... but how long will it last? ""Very well sir... lobster stuffed with tacos.""This Little Wiggy: Marge forces Bart to befriend Ralph Wiggum. Bart steals Chief Wiggum's key to the city, and the fun ensues! ""Well, I'm an idiot!""Trash of the Titans: This legendary 200th episode of the Simpsons features the voices of Steve Martin and all 4 members of U2. Homer becomes the new sanitation commissioner and finds creative ways to dispose of trash.King of the Hill: Tired of the embarrassment of being fat, Homer gets himself into shape, and attempts to climb the Murderhorn to impress his family. ""Ohhhh... a GYME.""Special features are up to the high standard Simpsons fans expect and appreciate: audio commentary on every episode, animatics, extra language feature, a bit from the animators, etc. I didn't see the point of doing one of the latter for ""All Singing, All Dancing"" which is a clip show. But otherwise it is all good stuff. Oh, and there is even a sneak preview of the upcoming Simpsons movie, set for release this summer!

It was a transition year for the show as many writers, runners, etc. who had been with the show left.  Some would argue that season nine was the last great season of THE SIMPSONS for several years until about season fifteen or sixteen.  Reflecting the transition of the show's workforce, season nine includes episodes that have become classic SIMPSONS episodes, e.g. ""The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson"" and ""Trash of the Titans"", as well as episodes that were okay, but nothing special, e.g. ""Bart Star"" and ""All Singing, All Dancing.""  Season nine is the last season to feature Phil Hartman  (who was murdered the following summer by his wife) voicing some great secondary characters, such as Lionel Hutz.  The complete list of episodes is:""The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson""--After a late night drinking spree, Homer lets Barney borrow his car.  Weeks later Homer receives a letter from the City of New York informing him that his car is illegally parked and that if it isn't moved, will soon be towed.  Homer hates New York, but packs up the family and sets off on a bus to the Big Apple to get back his car.  This episode has some amazing background and set animation.  It's also features the Twin Towers.  For three years after Sept. 11, 2001, the episode was never seen in syndication but has since been added back into the rotation.  Also, this episode has the first appearance of Duff Man.""The Principal and the Pauper""--turns out that Principal Skinner isn't the man who he claimed to be over twenty years ago when he returned home from Vietnam.  Turns out Principal Skinner is actually Armin Tamzarian a troubled youth who served under the real Seymour Skinner in Vietnam.  The real Seymour Skinner returns to Springfield and Armin Tamzarian leaves his job and moves to Capital City.""Lisa's Sax""--Lisa's saxophone is destroyed and Homer and Marge explain how Lisa got her saxophone in the first place.""Treehouse of Horror VIII""--""Homega Man"" finds Homer as the last man left alive living in Springfield after a nuclear Holocaust.  ""Fly vs. Fly"" has Bart turning into a mutant fly.  ""Easy-Bake Coven"" stars Marge in a segment that parodies THE CRUCIBAL (with a nod to the Scarlet Letter).""The Cartridge Family""--a soccer riot that leads to city-wide looting and violence causes Homer to decide he needs a gun to protect his family.  He buys a firearm and joins the NRA.  Marge can't stand having the gun in the house and forces Homer to choose between keeping the gun or living with his family.""Bart Star""--Homer gets Ned Flanders so upset that he quits as the coach of the local pee-wee football team and gives the job to Homer.  Remembering how unsupported his own father was, Homer attempts to build Bart up by showing favoritism and making him the quarterback.  However, Bart isn't any good and finds himself the center of physical correction by his teammates.""The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons""--Apu is the most eligible bachelor in Springfield and is living the good life.  That is until his mother writes to inform him she is coming to visit along with his pre-arranged bride, Manjula, so that they can be married.""Lisa the Skeptic""--during a school archeological dig, Lisa uncovers what appears to be the skeleton of an angel.  Lisa is skeptical, but the town finds itself in a frenzy.""Realty Bites""--Marge gets a job as a real estate agent.  I believe this is the first appearance of Gil.""Miracle on Evergreen Terrace""--during a morning of Christmas greed, Bart accidentally burns down the Christmas tree and all the Christmas presents.  He hides the evidence under a pile of buried snow in the front yard.  The citizens of Springfield take pity upon the Simpsons in a scene taken from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  That is until the townfolk find out exactly what Bart did.""All Singing, All Dancing""--a clip show told in song that looks back at some of the singing and dancing moments of the first eight seasons of THE SIMPSONS.""Bart Carny""--Bart and Homer start working at a traveling carnival after Bart destroys Hitler's car.  Bart and Homer befriend one of the carnies and his son, but soon find themselves in a battle of wits as the carnies squat the Simpsons' home.""The Joy of Sect""--the Simpsons and many of the other citizens of Springfield find themselves joining and being brainwashed into a cult.  Marge escapes and with the help of Ned Flanders and Rev. Lovejoy attempts to get her family back and uncover the scam The Leader is pulling.""Das Bus""--the Simpsons take on LORD OF THE FLIES.  A Springfield Elementary bus crashes and the students find themselves on a deserted island and attempt to build a society of their own.""The Last Temptation of Krust""--Krusty realizes that his material hasn't aged well and thinks about leaving the business.  That is until he just starts telling the truth and discovers comedy gold.""Dumbell Indemnity""--Moe falls in love and gives his new girlfriend the best that money can buy.  However, the money dries up and Moe decides to commit insurance fraud, with the help of Home, in order to keep his lady in style.  Homer is caught and Moe lets him take the fall.""Lisa the Simpson""--Lisa is afraid she might be losing her intelligence and is told by all the male members of her family that there is nothing she can do because of the ""Simpson"" gene that brings about ignorance.  She decides to sap out the best from life she can before she forgets how to enjoy things like jazz and museums.""This Little Wiggy""--Marge forces Bart to have a playdate with Ralph Wiggum.  Bart becomes friends with Ralph and with the help of Chief Wiggum's master town key they have the time of their lives.  This is the episode when Ralph first mentions the leprechaun that tells him to burn things.""Simpson Tide""--Home and his friends join the Naval Reserve and find themselves aboard a nuclear submarine.  After the Captain is ejecting from a torpedo tube, Homer finds himself in command of the vessel and attempting to ward of an international incident.""The Trouble with Trillions""--Homer finds himself working for the IRS after failing to fill out an income tax return properly.  Homer agrees to entrap Mr. Burns because of a mysterious trillion dollar bill Mr. Burns stole from the government over fifty years before.""Girly Edition""--Lisa and Bart become co-anchors of a children's operating news program.""Trash of the Titans""--the 200th episode of THE SIMPSONS.  Homer decides to run for the office of sanitation commissioner and brings about radical changes when elected.  Steve Martin and U2 both guest voiced.""King of the Hill""--in attempt to win over the adoration of Bart, Homer secretly begins bulking up.  He's approached by two promoters and agrees to climb the killing mountain, Murderhorn.""Lost Our Lisa""--Lisa finagles her way into getting to ride the public bus downtown to see a special Egyptian exhibit at the museum.  The bus doesn't go where she wants to and she finds herself wandering around Springfield alone.  Homer attempts to rescue her and they share a very special father and daughter moment together.""Natural Born Kissers""--Marge and Homer's love life has grown stale.  After discovering how excited they are after almost being caught in public, there passion is reignited.  Then they are almost discovered at a miniature golf course and are forced to flee through town naked.My favorite episodes from this season are ""The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson"", ""Treehouse of Horror VII"", ""Bart Carny"", ""Das Bus"", ""Trash of the Titans"", and ""Lost Our Lisa.""Special features in the season nine set include commentaries for all the episodes; a couple of Bit From the Animators segments with Yeardley Smith, Pete Michels, Mike Anderson, and Matt Groening, a moment with U2; Butterfinger commercials and an commercials for an Australian snack called CCs; a riff from Matt Groening; deleted scenes; original sketches; and two animation showcases.All said and done, Season Nine is a great season of THE SIMPSONS.",5,Still In THE SIMPSONS Golden Era,1191715200,"10 7,

Many of these episodes are still extremely funny on repeated viewings. The parody of Lord of the Flies, titled ""Das Bus"" is worth it alone (""go banana!""). Some other particularly good episodes in this season are: Realty Bites, This Little Wiggy, Lisa's Sax, The Trouble with Trillions and The Cartridge Family. If you're a serious Simpsons fan, you're likely to really want this season 9 set even if some of the seasons that follow are not so much to your liking.
