I was very excited that this box set finally has commentaries by the actresses; however, so far I've only listened to two commentaries and most of the time they do not talk.  They may say 4 sentences throughout the whole commentary.  I wonder why they even included them.  Maybe in the last season box set they will have the best extras.  :) Enjoy.

Seasons 1-4 had a nice layout that was different yet they coplimented each other well and you could tell they were part of the same collection.  Now with season 5 they decide to put the great characters from this show together in a GODDY STAR and slap a ""SEASON 5"" in HUGE text on the bottom where in previous seasons it was less obvious.  These changes of course is not enough for me not to buy this.....that would be crazy.  BUT I am really not happy with the cover art changes.

971536,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B000EBGFQI,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[4, 4]","Making its debut in the fall of 1985, The Golden Girls quickly established itself as a fixture of Saturday night prime time television. Following the lives of four older women living together as roommates in Miami, the show displayed a raw wit and a biting humor. The women live in the house of Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), a Southern belle who loves men of every kind and has dated every eligible bachelor in the Miami area. Her roommates are former high school teacher Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur) and St. Olaff housewife and widower Rose Nylund (Betty White). Rose loves to tell stories about her former hometown, much to the chagrin of the other girls. The three are joined by Dorothy's mother, firebrand Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), a spunky Italian immigrant who always speaks her mind. In her early-eighties, Sophia may walk at a measured pace, but the velocity of her sarcasm only increases with age.Overall, this is a charming situation comedy with likeable characters who have certainly developed their own unique identities. Although some parts of the show tend to be used over and over again (such as the St. Olaff stories and Dorothy's reaction to them), The Golden Girls never seems to grow tiresome. With powerful performances from each of the cast members, viewers will find that Sophia's wit steals the show...The Golden Girls (Season 5) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Sick and Tired"" in which Dorothy is wrought with frustration when numerous doctors diagnose her constant fatigue and lethargy as ""nothing""... Other notable episodes include ""Dancing in the Dark"" in which Rose feels out of place among her boyfriend's intellectual college professor friends, and ""Clinton Avenue Memoirs"" in which, distraught over Sophia's increasing forgetfulness, Dorothy takes her mother back to their old apartment in Brooklyn in an attempt to spark her memory...Below is a list of episodes included on The Golden Girls (Season 5) DVD:Episode 103 (Sick and Tired: Part 1) Air Date: 09-23-1989Episode 104 (Sick and Tired: Part 2) Air Date: 09-30-1989Episode 105 (The Accurate Conception) Air Date: 10-14-1989Episode 106 (Rose Fights Back) Air Date: 10-21-1989Episode 107 (Love Under the Big Top) Air Date: 10-28-1989Episode 108 (Dancing in the Dark) Air Date: 11-04-1989Episode 109 (Not Another Monday) Air Date: 11-11-1989Episode 110 (That Old Feeling) Air Date: 11-18-1989Episode 111 (Comedy of Errors) Air Date: 11-25-1989Episode 112 (All That Jazz) Air Date: 12-02-1989Episode 113 (Ebb Tide) Air Date: 12-09-1989Episode 114 (Have Yourself a Very Little Christmas) Air Date: 12-16-1989Episode 115 (Mary Has a Little Lamb) Air Date: 01-06-1990Episode 116 (Great Expectations) Air Date: 01-13-1990Episode 117 (Triple Play) Air Date: 01-27-1990Episode 118 (Clinton Avenue Memoirs) Air Date: 02-03-1990Episode 119 (Like the Beep Beep Beep of the Tom-Tom) Air Date: 02-10-1990Episode 120 (An Illegitimate Concern) Air Date: 02-12-1990Episode 121 (72 Hours) Air Date: 02-17-1990Episode 122 (Twice in a Lifetime) Air Date: 02-24-1990Episode 123 (Sisters and Other Strangers) Air Date: 03-03-1990Episode 124 (Cheaters) Air Date: 03-24-1990Episode 125 (The Mangiacavallo Curse Makes a Lousy Wedding Present) Air Date: 03-31-1990Episode 126 (All Bets Are Off) Air Date: 04-28-1990Episode 127 (The President's Coming!

I have some fond memories of spending Saturday nights with grandma, making our famous Jeno's pizza, Coke, and watching an episode of the Golden Girls. Many laughs were shared, and many good times had. The show coming out on DVD was so welcome, and with each season, they get better and better!Season 5 was one of the strongest seasons they had. Many episodes this season were some of my favorites of the series. This is the season where Miles is finally introduced to Rose, played by the talented Harold Gould.  Dorothy fights chronic fatigue syndrome as creator Susan Harris does in real life. Blanches daughter wants to have a child through artificial semination. Sophia struggles with losing her memory.The writing this season was particularly rich and funny. The writers added more depth and seriousness to Blanche's character (with her illegitimate son) and the previously mentioned Sophia forgetting episode. The acting is also first rate. The girls are obviously comfortable in their characters, and say the lines with such great comic timing that even with repeated viewings, you find yourself laughing out loud.This season finally comes with some commentary provided by three of the girls: Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, and Betty White. The commentary sometimes lacks any real information about the show. Ms. Arthur repeatedly yells out ""The writing! The writing!"" in her commentary. Ms. McClanahan seems to provide the most information, learning about how she had it in her contract to keep all of Blanche's clothes after the show ended, and how she still has them. Still, ANY comments by these wonderful ladies is welcome by this rabid fan.Why am I such a fan after all of these years? There is a comfortableness spending time in the house. There is the wonderful acting, the many laughs. Maybe it's because it's about four women living independently without having to rely on a man. Or maybe it's because it was one of my Gram's favorite shows. Whatever the reason, it's so nice to have my ladies here, whenever I need a laugh.",5,Welcome to Miami,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,2100,"['Why', 'almost', 'forty', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'fan', 'show', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'spending', 'Saturday', 'nights', 'grandma', 'making', 'famous', 'Jeno', 'pizza', 'Coke', 'watching', 'episode', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Many', 'laughs', 'were', 'shared', 'many', 'good', 'times', 'had', 'show', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', 'so', 'welcome', 'season', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'one', 'strongest', 'seasons', 'had', 'Many', 'episodes', 'season', 'were', 'favorites', 'series', 'season', 'where', 'Miles', 'finally', 'introduced', 'Rose', 'played', 'talented', 'Harold', 'Gould', 'Dorothy', 'fights', 'chronic', 'fatigue', 'syndrome', 'creator', 'Susan', 'Harris', 'real', 'life', 'Blanches', 'daughter', 'have', 'child', 'artificial', 'semination', 'Sophia', 'losing', 'memory.The', 'writing', 'season', 'was', 'particularly', 'rich', 'funny', 'writers', 'added', 'more', 'depth', 'seriousness', 'Blanche', 'character', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'Sophia', 'forgetting', 'episode', 'acting', 'also', 'first', 'rate', 'girls', 'are', 'obviously', 'comfortable', 'characters', 'say', 'lines', 'such', 'great', 'comic', 'timing', 'even', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'find', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud.This', 'season', 'finally', 'commentary', 'provided', 'three', 'girls', 'Bea', 'Arthur', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'Betty', 'White', 'commentary', 'sometimes', 'real', 'information', 'show', 'Ms.', 'Arthur', 'repeatedly', 'out', 'writing', 'writing', 'commentary', 'Ms.', 'McClanahan', 'provide', 'most', 'information', 'learning', 'how', 'had', 'contract', 'keep', 'Blanche', 'clothes', 'show', 'ended', 'how', 'still', 'Still', 'ANY', 'comments', 'wonderful', 'ladies', 'welcome', 'rabid', 'am', 'fan', 'years', 'comfortableness', 'spending', 'time', 'house', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'many', 'laughs', 'Maybe', 'four', 'women', 'living', 'independently', 'having', 'rely', 'man', 'was', 'one', 'Gram', 'favorite', 'shows', 'reason', 'so', 'nice', 'have', 'ladies', 'here', 'whenever', 'need', 'laugh']",The Golden Girls: Season 5

971551,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B000EBGFQI,JGC,"[4, 5]","As a very small child I would fight with my brother every Saturday night when this came on because he never wanted to watch these four old broads. But I did! And so did most of the country!  The GG's is classic eighties comedy, at its best! I love watching this show because it's sorta corny in a way but still almost nostalgic. It totally reminds me of my grannys. And, the writing, the comedy and the timing was second to none.These are the syndicated eps, but I do not mind at all. As I've stated many times, anything diced and sliced is still millennia better than anything on the reality-chowder-pot which has morphed into Network TV! But just so you know, the reason why these are the syndicated eps is not because they didn't have the network versions licensed, it is because the highest quality masters that Buena Vista has are for the syndicated version. (By the way, the Fifth Season will be released onto Region 2 on March 8th & on Region 4 on April 2nd!)Don't you almost feel like the entire cast is like old friends that you've known for years? There is a very special place in my heart for all of them, especially Bea Arthur. I don't know what it is, she's just the perfect person to portray the tired and harried Dorothy. Isn't she? Years ago, a good friend and I went to see her perform on Broadway. And, being the big fans that we were (and still are) we went and waited outside the stage door for her to exit. Anyway, when Bea came out, it was so hilarious. She starts yelling at everyone, ""get out of my way, I'm not signing any autographs."" Anyhow, it was just so surreal because Bea was totally behaving like Dorothy; although I'm not sure if even Dorothy was that crotchety? We could not stop laughing at Bea's impromptu encore performance and it only made me love her even more! She taught me one important lesson, always Bea who you want to Bea!Didn't Dorothy always have the funniest lines? The lines were great, but also so was Bea because she always said it so deadpan, there was never a smile or a subtle look of craziness. These are some of my favorites:MA!!!PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.Don't ask me, I can't get through to New Jersey with MCI.I would go out back but there doesn't seem to be any SHADY PINES.Chew it slowly like they taught you in the HOME.You sound like Jim and Tammy Faye on NIGHTLINE!Didn't Jack and Janet do this to Chrissy on an episode of ""Three's Company?""Mr. Belvedere is a humble servant, you are a horsesass.It's a rare sitcom that's performers are each as likeable and as talented as the other! These are the four members of this show:Beatrice Arthur played the somewhat frumpy and always stern and strong Dorothy Zbornak! One of my favorite lines & eps with Dorothy was during Season One when the girls all got locked up. Anyway, a tough-talking hooker tried to pick a fight with Blanche, prompting Dorothy to scare her off since she ""did time in Attica."" But Dorothy knew it would work, confessing to the girls, ""I work in the public school system, it's really no different."" Of course, before staring on the GG's, Bea was most known for the ground-breaking, perennial seventies sitcomMaude. Bea is also an accomplished Broadway performer and has appeared in many other series television programs (such as:All in the Familyand ""The Kraft Television Theater"") and movies (such as:Mameand ""The Floating Lightbulb."" ) Like all of the other members of this series, Bea has been a lifelong proponent of animal rights.Betty White portrayed sweet and extroverted Rose Nylund. Rose was a very proud St. Olafian and often told her roommates about how it was ""back in St. Olaf"" (much to their displeasure.) She worked as a grief counselor (and in later Seasons as a consumer reporter for a newscast) which was probably because Rose was the type of person who really enjoyed helping others. Before this series, Ms. White enjoyed a very successful career on television for over 35 years! She's probably most famous for her role as Sue Ann Nivens (onThe Mary Tyler Moore Show.) She also had her own variety show in the seventies, and through the fifties and sixties she had her own television talk show and television series. Betty White is also very famous for another eighties series,Mama's Family!Rue McClanahan played the role of sexy Blanche Devereaux. Blanche really enjoyed having a good time but could also be rather vain and catty at times; especially when another man was involved. She worked in an art museum and even though she was in her 50's, still enjoyed a very active sex life! Prior to staring on the GG's, Rue was a cast member on the long-running soap, ""Another World."" She also played Vivian, on Bea's series,Maudeand worked with Betty as prudish Aunt Franny onMama's Family, who was a complete and total opposite of man-crazy Blanche!And, of course Estelle Getty played the role of fiesty Sophia Petrillo! Sophia's tongue was as sharp as her wit! It was very rare for one of the other girls to get the best of her! Sophia enjoyed doing charity work and just generally being a family matriarch for her other housemates. Prior to joining ""The Golden Girls,"" Ms. Getty enjoyed a long career as a character actress, on the stage and in television and movies, such asTootsieand one of my very favorites,Mask! It's also a little-known fact that Ms. Getty was one of the first A-list television stars who supported AIDS causes!What I ultimately learned from ""The Golden Girls"" is that family can really be whatever you make of it. These women loved each other like sisters and I'm certain that the bond could not have been closer if in fact they were actually related. For most of its run, ""The Golden Girls"" always remained a top-ten series. And, this can be attributed to the stars of the show. Season Five is certainly one of my favorite seasons. But, it's very hard to say which is my very favorite because this series always churned out high-quality entertainment. One of the reasons why I have always loved this show is because it totally transcends time and age because the main message of ""The Golden Girls"" was truly universal. And, isn't that really rare!",5,BLANCHE I CAN GET HERPES LISTENING TO THIS STORY!!,1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,6121,"['very', 'small', 'child', 'would', 'fight', 'brother', 'Saturday', 'night',

971552,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B000EBGFQI,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[23, 24]","""The Golden Girls"" continued to pour on the laughs as it went into Season Five. For this season the show had something new. The original writing team that wrote many of the episodes of ""The Golden Girls"" during its first four seasons decided to leave and pursue other projects. So a new staff of writers came on to write the episodes, and for the most part did a very good job. However, Season Five was slightly weaker than the previous four seasons. While most the episodes for the fifth season did have its share of big laughs, there were a few episodes that seemed to lack the comedy that all the episodes from the first four seasons had, and this seemed obvious with a new writing team. On the bright side, director Terry Hughes was back to direct the episodes, but Season Five would eventually be his final season at the helm of ""The Golden Girls"". His directing of the episodes in Season Five kept this show on top. After he left, the show started to lose a little of its greatness and comic edge in its final two seasons.SEASON FIVE (1989-90)The new writing team of ""The Golden Girls"" tried to do some new things to keep this show at the top of its game, and throughout Season Five came up with some good ideas and a new ongoing storyline. That storyline was Rose meeting a charming guy who would become her new boyfriend. That charming guy was Miles, who was wonderfully played by Harold Gould. Gould, who guest starred in the third episode of ""The Golden Girls"" way back in its first season, was terrific in this role and turned up in a couple of episodes in Season Five. This storyline with Rose and Miles was a winner. It was a little change of pace that the show needed. Episodes involving Rose and Miles included: when they start going out for the first time and Rose thinks she's too stupid for his taste, and when Miles introduces Rose to his daughter and his daughter tells Rose to stay away from him because he hasn't gotten over the loss of his wife. Other good episodes in Season Five included: Dorothy becoming very ill and going to several different doctors who can't find out what's wrong with her; Blanche's daughter coming to visit and telling her mother that she's going to have a baby via artificial insemination; Dorothy begins to date a lawyer who also has a gig as a circus clown; Blanche dealing with the death of her father; Dorothy helping out a pregnant teenage girl and trying to get the girls' father (who's thrown her out) to step in and help her out too; Rose getting tested for the HIV virus; Dorothy hosting Stan's Communist cousin who comes to Miami for a visit; Dorothy becoming addicted to gambling; and the girls preparing to meet the President of the United States.""The Golden Girls"" domination at the Emmy Awards ended after being shut out for its fourth season, but the nominations didn't stop. For Season Five, the show got 8 nominations, including another nod for Best Comedy Series. This was also the first time that Beatrice Arthur, Betty White, and Rue McClanahan were all not nominated together for Best Actress in a Comedy Series like they were for the first four seasons. This time, only White was nominated, while Arthur and McClanahan were passed over. Estelle Getty was nominated again for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, and deservedly so. She should have won three or four Emmys for her role as Sophia. Also recognized again was director Terry Hughes, who received directing nominations for all five seasons of ""The Golden Girls"", winning on his second nomination for Season Two. His last ""Golden Girls"" directing nomination was for the Season Five episode titled ""Triple Play"", which was one of the best directed episodes that I've ever seen. This episode deals with three totally different storylines that tie up neatly at the end: Rose meeting Miles' daughter; Blanche's backfired attempt at meeting men by renting a used car and pretending that its for sale, and all the men become more interested in the car than in going out with her; and Dorothy dealing with Sophia, who has stolen government money.Some of the guest stars from Season Five of ""The Golden Girls"" include: Dick Van Dyke as Dorothy's lawyer boyfriend who also does double duty as a circus clown in the episode ""Love Under the Big Top""; Jeffrey Tambor (""Arrested Development"") as one of the doctors who can't find the illness that Dorothy comes down with in part 1 of the episode ""Sick and Tired""; Geraldine Fitzgerald (who guest starred on an episode of ""The Golden Girls"" in Season Three) as Sophia's friend who plans to commit suicide in the episode ""Not Another Monday""; Robert Mandan (""Soap"") as Blanche's new beau who suffers a heart attack in the episode ""Great Expectations""; Mark Moses (""Desperate Housewives"") as a young man who claims to be the illegitimate son of Blanche's late husband in the episode ""An Illegitimate Concern""; Eddie Bracken as Rose's first love in the episode ""Twice in a Lifetime""; Barbara Babcock (""Hill Street Blues"") as Blanche's sister who comes to Miami as the newest author of a book that seems to be about Blanche's life, and Marian Mercer (""It's a Living"") as Stan's Communist cousin who complains about everything in America (except 7-Eleven Slurpees) in the episode ""Sisters and Other Strangers""; Jerry Orbach (""Law & Order"") as a guy Dorothy dated from the past in the episode ""Cheaters"" (this same character was featured in an episode of Season One and was played then by Alex Rocco); and Timothy Stack (""Night Stand"") as a government agent trying to get information on the girls before the arrival of the U.S. President in the episode (""The President's Coming! The President's Coming!"")I have rated ""The Golden Girls"": The Complete Fifth Season 5 stars. But if Amazon.com have 1/2 star ratings to rate from, I would have rated Season Five 4 1/2 stars, because to me the fifth season of my favorite show of all time wasn't quite up there with Seasons One through Four. But that doesn't mean that Season Five is bad. No way! There's lots to like in Season Five, and (of course) I highly recommend it to the show's biggest fans.Now I'm anxiously awaiting Season Six.",5,Golden Girls: Season Five,1140652800,"02 23,

971553,A3165255PFGM4Y,B000EBGFQI,J. Travis,"[7, 8]","I am glad we get some special features with this DVD of the 5th season of the Golden Girls. Excellent over-all, but unfortunatley the audio commentaries are less then satisfactory. Only Rue McClanahan, who played Blanche on the show, gives us 100%. She's just great. She not only gives in-depth analysis of what's going on as we watch, she also gives us history about how she loved the costumes, and which outfits she actually got to keep! That's what a good commentary is- getting more personal with your audience. I really enjoyed listenting to Rue's comments. Betty White and Bea Arthur, on the other hand, while very sweet and dear, lag in their's. Most notably, they comment on one thing, and then shut up for five to eight minutes at a stretch, not saying a thing. Then we'll hear them laugh or say ""great writing there"". It's almost as if they were dozing off during their turn at bat.You can defentiley tell tension between Betty White and Bea Arthur- neither one comments on the other's ""brilliance"" or even character. They comment on everyone else but each other. White, in paticular, is most noticeable when she goes on about how great Rue is in a scene, when it is Bea who is clearly talking the most. She totally ignores her. This is proof they didn't get along, and I don't care what you say about alleged gossip. Coincidence my eye.Over-all it's a great, strong season- better then the fourth in my opinion. Dorothy's hairstyle has changed, and Rue points out in one of her commentaries that Bea Arthur had worn her hair down for a movie she did, liked it so much that she hired the hairdresser for the show. Rue comments she preferred Arthur's original style, but who is she to comment since she admits Bea is a bigger star then she is. See, that's a good commentary.

Season five begins with the two part Sick and Tired where Dorothy is diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and is frustrated by an endless maze of unsympathetic doctors who brand her as crazy or tell her to go see a hair dresser. These episodes stuck out because of difficulties my mother has had with doctors over the years. The laughs pick up in other gems like The Accurate Conception where Blanches daughter decides to get artificially inseminated sending Blanche into hysterics. Another great one was ""Love Under The Big Top"" with guest star Dick Van Dyke where Dorothy's lawyer boyfriend decides to become a clown leading to a hilarious scene  in the courtroom after the girls are arrested during a protest of fishing practices.As usual the Golden Girls used the comedic pulpit to tackle several controversial issues of the day.  Golden Girls was the first show to my knowledge to tackle the topic of artificial insemination. They also produced quite a moving episode entitled ""Not Another Monday"" where Sophia's friend Martha wants to kill herself because she can no longer handle the pain of life and does not want to die alone. Another example is 72 Hours the show's second episode dealing with AIDS as Rose is tested for the disease following a blood transfusion during an operation. The episode Mary had a Little Lamb stands out because it deals with teenage pregnancy beyond Sophia reminding Dorothy of her accident with Stan as the girls care for a teenaged neighbor who has been thrown out by her father.",5,My favorite season of my favorite girls,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,1661,"['Season', 'Five', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'favorite', 'passing', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'last', 'week', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'seasons', 'hours', 'day', 'Season', 'five', 'begins', 'two', 'part', 'Sick', 'Tired', 'where', 'Dorothy', 'diagnosed', 'Chronic', 'Fatigue', 'Syndrome', 'frustrated', 'endless', 'maze', 'unsympathetic', 'doctors', 'who', 'brand', 'crazy', 'tell', 'go', 'see', 'hair', 'dresser', 'episodes', 'stuck', 'out', 'difficulties', 'mother', 'had', 'doctors', 'years', 'laughs', 'pick', 'up', 'other', 'gems', 'Accurate', 'Conception', 'where', 'Blanches', 'daughter', 'decides', 'get', 'artificially', 'inseminated', 'sending', 'Blanche', 'hysterics', 'great', 'one', 'was', 'Love', 'Big', 'Top', 'guest', 'star', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'where', 'Dorothy', 'lawyer', 'boyfriend', 'become', 'clown', 'leading', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'courtroom', 'girls', 'are', 'arrested', 'protest', 'fishing', 'practices.As', 'usual', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'used', 'comedic', 'pulpit', 'tackle', 'several', 'controversial', 'issues', 'day', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'was', 'first', 'show', 'knowledge', 'tackle', 'topic', 'artificial', 'insemination', 'also', 'produced', 'quite', 'moving', 'episode', 'entitled', 'Not', 'Monday', 'where', 'Sophia', 'friend', 'Martha', 'kill', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'handle', 'pain', 'life', 'not', 'want', 'die', 'alone', 'example', '72', 'Hours', 'show', 'second', 'episode', 'dealing', 'AIDS', 'Rose', 'tested', 'disease', 'following', 'blood', 'transfusion', 'operation', 'episode', 'Mary', 'had', 'Little', 'Lamb', 'out', 'teenage', 'pregnancy', 'Sophia', 'reminding', 'Dorothy', 'accident', 'Stan', 'girls', 'care', 'teenaged', 'neighbor', 'who', 'been', 'thrown', 'out', 'father']",The Golden Girls: Season 5

I have watched it for many years on television and recorded all their episodes (thirty tapes worth). After all these years, it is still one of my all time favorite shows due to its atmosphere of camaraderie, coziness, and interesting story lines. The main characters were so well acted that I feel as though they were members of my own family. However, the secondary actors generally did a very poor job.For those of you who are devoted fans you might be interested in this list of episodes and summaries that I have compiled :1. Sick and Tired Part 1 :Dorothy begins to feel rather sick for no apparent reason. She visits numerous doctors who treat her as though she is crazy since they are unable to diagnose her malady. Simultaneously, Blanche begins to write a romance novel.2. Sick and Tired Part 2 :Finally, Dorothy is able to locate a doctor who is sympathetic to her problem. He explains to her that she does, in actuality have a malady entitled Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, that has just been discovered. Later, when the girls are at a restaurant, Dorothy encounters one of her previous doctors and embarrasses him in front of the entire restaurant when she delivers her sermon against the conceit and unwillingness of some doctors to believe their patients when they are truly ill.3. The Accurate Conception :Blanche disapproves when her unmarried daughter, Rebecca, decides to get artificially inseminated.4. Rose Fights Back :When Charlie's old company goes bankrupt, they send Rose a letter telling her that they can no longer send her the pension she had been receiving. Unable to afford to live on her own, she begins her search for a new job with dire consequences. She is refused at every job due to her age. Meanwhile, Sophia acquires a membership at a Shopper's Warehouse and begins to order massive quantities of utterly useless groceries including five cartons of sardines.5. That Old FeelingBlanche falls in love with her late husband`s brother. However, he refuses to marry her saying that she is in love with the memory of her dead husband, not in love with him as an individual. Meanwhile, Sophia is stealing the car to go on a blind date.6. Love Under the Big TopDorothy's lawyer boyfriend decides that he would rather take a job as a circus clown.

Fortunately I bought the dvd set and realized how great those episodes were, like the 2-part episode Sick and Tired. It had a whole new meaning to me after learning it was based on the show's creater and writer Susan Harris. Clinton Avenue memories made me a little teary eyed, considering Estelle Harris ended up suffering a similiar fate. I suppose the show needed to reflect the times and they did it with such grace and humor!!!I especially enjoyed Dancing in the Dark episode because all the Gals got all dolled up and went to this classy nightclub.

Still, season five is worth having as there are some innovative stories that were told.

""72 Hours"" was a topical episode for its day as Rose is informed that she may have come in contact with the AIDS virus from a blood transfusion.

You cannot tell me that there are not hours and hours of bloopers and re-takes and deleted scenes lying around in a video storeroom somewhere.  So far we have had a fasion commentary by Joan Rivers, an idiotic trivia game where the questions weren't even about the show and now some really boring commentary by Bea, Rue and Betty on a few episodes that are a real snore to listen to.  These characters are all so funny and the women who play them are all wonderful actresses.
