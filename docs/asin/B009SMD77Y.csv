The background as set post WWII is amazing - the sets, the autos, the buildings and costumes are all wonderfully done and you are instantly transported to that time in Italy. The acting is wonderful and even more enjoyable since this is the story of a real police commissioner - he is highly likeable from the first shot of the first episode and gets more likeable as it goes along. His sometimes near the edge supervision is wonderful and you see a good man first and a good Commissario second - his gentle kindness and his rapport with the unit are really special to see.

1601894,A29Y2B2OVQNMLM,B009SMD77Y,Dean Corso,"[1, 1]","A fantastic police drama series well written, directed, acted, and seamlessly done. An interesting insight to Italian culture and Milano with such likable characters that are real life people dealing with the agony and the ecstasy of real life problems. They run the gamut of personal issues including ethics and morals. Its good guy vs, bad guys but not with the heavy violence saturated, profanity-laced, blood-spattered gore of a Hollywood film. There is an over-all aura of happiness about this clique of Nardone's and it blossoms like a fragrant bouquet of Freija in the last scenes. No profanity, sex, or nudity so its good for the whole family.

Right away we learn that the northern Italians in Post-war Milan CANNOT make good coffee the way they do in the South. This is according to Nardone, of course.

1601896,A16CWY4RZS28DL,B009SMD77Y,F. Fairfield,"[4, 9]","1.  Minor defect:  In disc B, at the end Chapter 1 of Episode 6, my disc returns to the main menu.  It did that twice.  If that happens to you, there is a simple solution:  at the main menu, click on ""Chapters"" under Episode 6, then start with Chapter 2.  No problem after that. (I don't think it is my Blu-ray player, as I have had no problem with other discs.) No big deal, and I mention it only because it may help others.2.  The series consists of 12 episodes averaging 52 minutes each.  This means that there is not much time for plot and character development.  Plus, as in most detective series, we are treated to slices of the detectives' private life.  There is the rub:  Nardone is not working alone; he has four colleagues working with him.  Four colleagues plus the chief = five private lives.  Far too much.  The series ends up feeling like a napoleon: alternating layers of ""crisp"" criminal plot and ""custardy"" private life.In a napoleon (I have not had one in 50 years), these alternating layers are delicious; irritating to eat, though, because when you bite at one end, the layers at the other end come apart, the custard filling oozes out, and you have to keep licking your fingers (don't even try knife and fork).  Same thing here, the mushy private-life stories (five of them, remember!) end up taking over, and the criminal plot is reduced to a series of sketches.  The last episode, where all the loose threads are tied (five happy endings!), is downright boring.  Too bad, because the starting idea was pretty good.3.  The good points:  (1) it is in Italian; (2) there is no swearing, no bad language, no nudity, no gratuitous violence (some shootings, of course); (3) you see the cathedral of Milan, and get the feel of the city (the most French-looking of all Italian cities, according to Montaigne, who was there in 1688; that was still true in 2005).If you don't mind the sentimental stuff, buy this series; it is cheap enough (I got mine from Import CDs, for less than $25).  If you prefer undiluted crime, forget it; instead you should consider the Maigret series (the one with Bruno Cremer), an MHZ-networks release offered by Amazon; it is just as clean (i.e. no swearing, etc.) and far better than this.",3,DEFINITELY SECOND RATE (also minor defect in Disc B),1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,2235,"['1', 'Minor', 'defect', 'disc', 'B', 'end', 'Chapter', '1', 'Episode', '6', 'disc', 'returns', 'main', 'menu', 'did', 'twice', 'simple', 'solution', 'main', 'menu', 'click', 'Chapters', 'Episode', '6', 'then', 'start', 'Chapter', '2', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'have', 'had', 'problem', 'other', 'discs', 'big', 'deal', 'mention', 'only', 'may', 'help', 'others.2', 'series', '12', 'episodes', 'averaging', '52', 'minutes', 'not', 'much', 'time', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'most', 'detective', 'series', 'are', 'treated', 'slices', 'detectives', 'private', 'life', 'rub', 'Nardone', 'not', 'working', 'alone', 'four', 'colleagues', 'working', 'Four', 'colleagues', 'chief', '=', 'five', 'private', 'lives', 'Far', 'too', 'much', 'series', 'up', 'feeling', 'napoleon', 'alternating', 'layers', 'crisp', 'criminal', 'plot', 'custardy', 'private', 'life.In', 'napoleon', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'one', '50', 'years', 'alternating', 'layers', 'are', 'delicious', 'irritating', 'eat', 'though', 'when', 'bite', 'one', 'end', 'layers', 'other', 'end', 'come', 'apart', 'custard', 'filling', 'out', 'have', 'keep', 'licking', 'fingers', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'knife', 'fork', 'Same', 'thing', 'here', 'mushy', 'private-life', 'stories', 'five', 'remember', 'end', 'up', 'taking', 'criminal', 'plot', 'reduced', 'series', 'sketches', 'last', 'episode', 'where', 'loose', 'threads', 'are', 'tied', 'five', 'happy', 'endings', 'downright', 'boring', 'Too', 'bad', 'starting', 'idea', 'was', 'pretty', 'good.3', 'good', 'points', '1', 'Italian', '2', 'swearing', 'bad', 'language', 'nudity', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'shootings', 'course', '3', 'see', 'cathedral', 'Milan', 'get', 'feel', 'city', 'most', 'French-looking', 'Italian', 'cities', 'according', 'Montaigne', 'who', 'was', 'there', '1688', 'was', 'still', 'true', '2005', '.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sentimental', 'stuff', 'buy', 'series', 'cheap', 'enough', 'got', 'Import', 'CDs', 'less', '25', 'prefer', 'undiluted', 'crime', 'forget', 'instead', 'should', 'consider', 'Maigret', 'series', 'one', 'Bruno', 'Cremer', 'MHZ-networks', 'release', 'offered', 'Amazon', 'just', 'clean', 'i.e', 'swearing', 'etc', 'far', 'better']",N/A
