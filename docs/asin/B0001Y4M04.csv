OMG that was the funniest thing of all times. So in that regard it is well worth checking out...pretty good lighting and overall quality film production was great; look forward to seeing some of these women do other films they stood out for sure!!",3,Black Beautiful Queens - Tell the Naked Truth!,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",2013,787,"['story', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'like', 'club', 'scene', 'definitely', 'own', 'crowd', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'lady', 'was', 'out', 'parking', 'lot', 'wearing', 'just', 'strip', 'cloths', 'was', 'shocked', '.was', 'kind', 'uncessary', 'oh', 'well', '.other', 'gritty', 'story', 'young', 'model', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'way', 'night', 'become', 'success', 'like', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Player', 'Club', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'incredibly', 'histerical', 'scene', 'where', 'ladies', 'were', 'dressing', 'room', 'fight', 'broke', 'out', 'fight', 'out', 'was', 'funniest', 'thing', 'times', 'So', 'regard', 'well', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'pretty', 'good', 'lighting', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'production', 'was', 'great', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'women', 'do', 'other', 'films', 'stood', 'out', 'sure']",N/A
817000,A1FATTRIXTSTEB,B0001Y4M04,"Pamela Jarmon-Wade ""Tx Red Rose""","[11, 12]","The Naked Truth is so similar to The Players, but The Players Club would earn more stars.  If you enjoyed Players Club, you will like this one too.  It stars Ki Toy Johnson, Tiana Jackson, Leland Jones and Trinita Turner.  It features music by Thugz Nation, 285, 404 Soldierz, The Ivey Boyz and Juvenile.  The cover has the San Francisco Black Film Festival seal for official selection displayed.The G-Spot is an Atlanta Strip Club that is corrupt.  The story focuses on three shake dancers that go by the names Cream, Cat and Belinda.  There is a lot of footage of the dancers performing, which may mislead the viewer in the beginning.  One may tend to think that the movie is all about flesh, sex, drugs and corruption...but eventually the movie gets into some substance to hold your attention and carry the storyline through.  Salem (the club's owner) seems to be all about the money.  He has Cream doing more than dancing for him, so I guess he could be called a Pimp too.  He installs video cameras so that he can see everything that happens at The G-Spot.  He has a cop on his payroll too which leads to murder and mystery.  The movie has a few redeeming qualities at the end.  One dancer graduates and gets out of the business.  A former  gay dancer, current cashier turns her life around for the better after her lover is killed.  The narrator of the story breaks it down to the naked truth.",3,Similar to The Players Club...,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,1399,"['Naked', 'Truth', 'so', 'similar', 'Players', 'Players', 'Club', 'would', 'earn', 'more', 'stars', 'enjoyed', 'Players', 'Club', 'will', 'like', 'one', 'too', 'Ki', 'Toy', 'Johnson', 'Tiana', 'Jackson', 'Leland', 'Jones', 'Trinita', 'Turner', 'music', 'Thugz', 'Nation', '285', '404', 'Soldierz', 'Ivey', 'Boyz', 'Juvenile', 'cover', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Black', 'Film', 'Festival', 'seal', 'official', 'selection', 'displayed.The', 'G-Spot', 'Atlanta', 'Strip', 'Club', 'corrupt', 'story', 'three', 'shake', 'dancers', 'go', 'names', 'Cream', 'Cat', 'Belinda', 'lot', 'footage', 'dancers', 'performing', 'may', 'mislead', 'viewer', 'beginning', 'One', 'may', 'tend', 'think', 'movie', 'flesh', 'sex', 'drugs', 'corruption', 'eventually', 'movie', 'substance', 'hold', 'attention', 'carry', 'storyline', 'Salem', 'club', 'owner', 'be', 'money', 'Cream', 'doing', 'more', 'dancing', 'so', 'guess', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'Pimp', 'too', 'video', 'cameras', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'everything', 'G-Spot', 'cop', 'payroll', 'too', 'murder', 'mystery', 'movie', 'few', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'end', 'One', 'dancer', 'graduates', 'business', 'former', 'gay', 'dancer', 'current', 'cashier', 'life', 'better', 'lover', 'killed', 'narrator', 'story', 'down', 'naked', 'truth']",N/A
