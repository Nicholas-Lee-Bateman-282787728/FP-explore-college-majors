805098,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B0001GWBMS,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[11, 19]","There are some good reasons to watch this. The rare footage of Castro, Muhammad Ali in his Cassius Clay days, Bill Cosby's hilarious TV debut, and rare interviews with Barry Goldwater, Richard Milhous Nixon, Rev. Billy Graham, and an incomplete segment with Bobby Kennedy make this interesting for historians.However, for those of us under 50, we can only wonder what was the big deal about Paar himself. Granted, be brought some interesting people to his show and they say some mighty controversial things not common on televsion of the ""Leave-it to beaver"" era. Rev. Graham's unabashed fundamentalism in his remarks would alienate many modern viewers, Nixon coldly criticizes his rival JFK's handling of the Bay of Pigs moths after the fact, and Barry Goldwater's unabashed views on the Conservative agenda make this a good one for American history classes.But Paar himself comes off here as a rather effete and insufferable snob. His nasal delivery is dry and annoying and his persona is filled with patronizing remaks regading anything he considers ""beneath"" him (note his comments on the Beatles and their fans). Plus he makes some extremely patronizing and racist comments about Africa and Africans with Arthur Godfrey right after young Bill Cosby leaves the stage! He also refers to Cassius Clay/Ali as a ""nice looking boy"" to which the soon to be Ali clearly winces. (Paar's reference to Rev. Billy Graham about a clearly adult janitor as a ""Negro boy"" will also certainly draw groans today).Paar's comedy routines are quite topical for his times and no one could fault him for doing now-dated routines on LBJ and the Kennedys. While no one would laugh at this subject matter today, even without it being dated, Paar's delivery would be too dry and dull for modern audiences.As a time capsule, it's interesting. If you're over 50, I would probably recommend it for nostalgic reasons. Other than that, it's interesting a historical curio for its guests that's not likely to make new fans for the late Jack Paar.",3,Mostly for historians,1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,2018,"['are', 'good', 'reasons', 'watch', 'rare', 'footage', 'Castro', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'Cassius', 'Clay', 'days', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'hilarious', 'TV', 'debut', 'rare', 'interviews', 'Barry', 'Goldwater', 'Richard', 'Milhous', 'Nixon', 'Rev', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'incomplete', 'segment', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'make', 'interesting', 'historians.However', '50', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'was', 'big', 'deal', 'Paar', 'Granted', 'be', 'brought', 'interesting', 'people', 'show', 'say', 'mighty', 'controversial', 'things', 'not', 'common', 'televsion', 'Leave-it', 'beaver', 'era', 'Rev', 'Graham', 'unabashed', 'fundamentalism', 'remarks', 'would', 'alienate', 'many', 'modern', 'viewers', 'Nixon', 'coldly', 'rival', 'JFK', 'handling', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'moths', 'fact', 'Barry', 'Goldwater', 'unabashed', 'views', 'Conservative', 'agenda', 'make', 'good', 'one', 'American', 'history', 'classes.But', 'Paar', 'off', 'here', 'rather', 'effete', 'insufferable', 'snob', 'nasal', 'delivery', 'dry', 'annoying', 'persona', 'filled', 'patronizing', 'remaks', 'regading', 'anything', 'beneath', 'note', 'comments', 'Beatles', 'fans', 'extremely', 'patronizing', 'racist', 'comments', 'Africa', 'Africans', 'Arthur', 'Godfrey', 'right', 'young', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'stage', 'also', 'Cassius', 'Clay/Ali', 'nice', 'looking', 'boy', 'soon', 'be', 'Ali', 'clearly', 'winces', 'Paar', 'reference', 'Rev', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'clearly', 'adult', 'janitor', 'Negro', 'boy', 'will', 'also', 'certainly', 'draw', 'groans', 'today', '.Paar', 'comedy', 'routines', 'are', 'quite', 'topical', 'times', 'one', 'could', 'fault', 'doing', 'now-dated', 'routines', 'LBJ', 'Kennedys', 'one', 'would', 'laugh', 'subject', 'matter', 'today', 'even', 'being', 'dated', 'Paar', 'delivery', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'dry', 'dull', 'modern', 'time', 'capsule', 'interesting', ""'re"", '50', 'would', 'probably', 'recommend', 'nostalgic', 'reasons', 'Other', 'interesting', 'historical', 'curio', 'guests', 'not', 'likely', 'make', 'new', 'fans', 'late', 'Jack', 'Paar']",N/A

His genuine interest in the people he interviewed and his obvious adoration he appeared to have toward his guest. The only downfall about this video is that it seemed more clipped and not a complete showing of his shows. Also, they seemed to add fillers which tended to be repeaters of what the viewer already saw previously.

This is because as far as we know, the GENIUSES at NBC must have 'wiped' over the original color videotape, leaving us with nothing but a crappy black and white film kinescope (kept for legal purposes). There is nothing worse than a black and white kinescope of a color cast. The stark reality is that there might very well be no color videotape of Paar in existence. The Tonight Show with Jack Paar began broadcasting on color videotape in the late 50s. No known example of this historic show in color has surfaced. The shows on this collection are from his Friday night prime time show, done after he quit the Tonight Show in 1962. All were in 'Living Color' on NBC. All were wiped over and the videotapes used again. (As far as we know). The same was done to the majority of the 1960s Carson Tonight Shows. For some reason the Ford Show with Tennessee Ernie Ford color videotape shows from the early 60s were preserved and can be purchased on the TEF website. There are various color Andy Williams available. (Though the shows are usually edited). The Dinah Shore Show color videotape shows from NBC sit in limbo. I assume they belong to the estate and they haven't figured out how to profit from them. But the lack of Paar in any quality form, is especially galling. This was a big name. A big talent. A very famous man in his time and a very unique broadcaster. And this is all that's left.

The first disc contains the PBS special JACK PAAR: SMART TELEVISION, which aired in 2003.  It has some of the same footage as AS I WAS SAYING, but also contains other clips, including the January 3, 1964 show where Paar introduces BBC footage of a new rock 'n' roll group from Liverpool called The Beatles.  (Unfortunately, the Fabs' performance of ""She Loves You"" was edited out, probably because the producers could not get clearance from Apple Corps.)  The disc also contains interviews with Jonathan Winters, Regis Philbin, Dick Cavett, Hugh Downs (Paar's announcer; later the host of CONCENTRATION, THE TODAY SHOW, and 20/20), The Smothers Brothers, and others.  Also included on Disc 1 are several sketches from the show, along with additional interviews from Philbin, Winters, Cavett, Downs, The Smothers Brothers, and others.  Disc 2 contains interviews with Richard Nixon, Liberace and Muhammad Ali (then still known as Cassius Clay), Billy Graham, Barry Goldwater, and Robert Kennedy, along with several Paar monologues.  Disc 3 contains three full episodes of THE JACK PAAR PROGRAM - a 1962 show with Bette Davis, Jonathan Winters, and Gisele MacKenzie; a 1964 show with Richard Burton (including bonus footage of Burton performing as ""Hamlet"" on Broadway), Bill Cosby, and Arthur Godfrey; and a 1963 London show with Judy Garland, Robert Morley, and Randolph Churchill (son of Sir Winston). Overall, picture and sound quality are good, considering the age of the shows, and the fact that NBC destroyed or lost the original masters years ago.Was Jack Paar better than Johnny Carson?  You really cannot compare the two.  Paar was a comedian, but also had a serious side; his show is more like Dick Cavett's (who worked as a writer for both Paar and Carson).  Johnny was more comedy-and variety-oriented, although he had a few serious interviews too.

805108,A1KESCXX2LTH83,B0001GWBMS,sundayclub,"[9, 12]","For over a decade, filmmakers David Leaf and John Scheinfeld have been documenting the lives of the all-time great entertainers. PBS viewers may be familiar with their ""Unknown"" documentaries on Jimmy Durante, Jonathan Winters, Peter Sellers and the Marx Brothers. Their latest DVD release features an hour-long profile of the late Jack Paar, a controversial talk-show host who appeared regularly on NBC-TV from 1957 to 1965.Paar was a mercurial personality whose on-camera mood swings made him an easy target for the media. His compulsiveness often led to questionable acts such as walking off the set during a live show, leaving his ill-prepared announcer to interview the guests. You won't see that infamous moment in this package, but you will see his hastily-arranged filmed interview with Fidel Castro in which he praises the dictator for being a ""good neighbor"". Castro returned the compliment by answering Paar's questions in English.The filmmakers had hours and hours of rare material to choose from, and this collection features two bonus discs stuffed full of unedited black-and-white footage from the vaults. Fans of Paar's pre-Carson ""Tonight"" shows will be disappointed by the lack of footage from this period, although there is an important clip from 1960 with presidential candidate John Kennedy (as well as a 1962 comedy sketch with Kennedy impersonator Vaughn Meader). The bulk of the footage comes from Paar's 1962-65 prime-time weekly show, possibly because the prints are in better quality.The filmmakers have taken care to present Paar as a witty conversationalist who could coax the most intimate details out of his guests, which is exactly how he would have wanted to be remembered. Unfortunately, this documentary ignores the self-destructive urges and the adrenaline-fueled rants that made his show so compelling to watch. For this reason, I'm recommending this package strictly for TV historians and Jack Paar's surviving friends.
