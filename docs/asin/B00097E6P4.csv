902574,A3673NBQVA4J2M,B00097E6P4,"Daniel Hayes ""D.R. Hayes""","[7, 7]","I don't want to call this a ""Tear Jerker"", but in some ways there has some elements that could have the makings for one. We have a teenage girl who's pretty, talented in writing, and can sing, but she's doomed to death as she's suffering with terminal cancer of the brain. She decides it's best to just cut everyone off from her, but God doesn't have that for her, and then enter Craig on fire for the Lord, or so everyone thinks, but in his heart he feels a lacking as he's doing the Lord's work, but his soul is crying out for passion. Enter Darby Peters the girl with terminal cancer to the brain. She shows toughness, but Craig won't give up on her, and once he starts being her friend her wall starts to crumble, but Craig wants to go the next step further(not sex),and that's to lead her to the Lord, but Craig hits some obstacles, and some of it is from himself. The one scene in this movie is when Craig is talking to his youth minister, and he tells Craig that God will direct a person to him in his own time, but Craig doesn't want to hear that because Darby's nearing the end, and then there's Darby's lack of faith where once she may have believed in God, but because of the illness she blames God, and while it's o.k. to tell God how angry and hurt you are to remember to pray for guidance, wisdom, and strength. There's another scene that I found rather interesting is where after Craig and Darby have an argument, and Craig leaves, and Darby goes home, and reads the Bible, but if you look outside her living room window it looks like Craig's out there jogging back and forth, and while I'm sure that Craig was praying hard for her soul, and so forth it was rather interesting they portrayed it that way. The best scene would have to be at the Youth Revival where Darby sings about seeing the love of Jesus in Craig's eyes. A very beautiful touching song, and if I can find it somewhere on a cd I will buy it; Craig can now be at peace that Darby will be in heaven when she dies, but he prays that he'll have somewhat of a life with her, and that's done up rather well when Darby goes on a family trip, and leaves Craig her memoirs which helps Craig know that Darby wants him too. I say this is geared towards teenagers, but for adults on the rebound whether through divorce, or being widowed like me. This can be still inspiring as it can help ignite your passions again, it can also remind you to seek the Lord. This was a little bit too much at times, but it's still worth watching.",4,"A movie that is geared toward teenagers, but adults should see too",1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,2500,"['do', ""n't"", 'want', 'call', 'Tear', 'Jerker', 'ways', 'elements', 'could', 'have', 'makings', 'one', 'have', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'pretty', 'talented', 'writing', 'can', 'sing', 'doomed', 'death', 'suffering', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'brain', 'best', 'just', 'cut', 'everyone', 'God', ""n't"", 'have', 'then', 'enter', 'Craig', 'fire', 'Lord', 'so', 'everyone', 'thinks', 'heart', 'lacking', 'doing', 'Lord', 'work', 'soul', 'crying', 'out', 'passion', 'Enter', 'Darby', 'Peters', 'girl', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'brain', 'toughness', 'Craig', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'once', 'being', 'friend', 'wall', 'crumble', 'Craig', 'go', 'next', 'step', 'further', 'not', 'sex', 'lead', 'Lord', 'Craig', 'obstacles', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'Craig', 'talking', 'youth', 'minister', 'Craig', 'God', 'will', 'direct', 'person', 'own', 'time', 'Craig', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'Darby', 'nearing', 'end', 'then', 'Darby', 'lack', 'faith', 'where', 'once', 'may', 'have', 'believed', 'God', 'illness', 'God', 'o.k', 'tell', 'God', 'how', 'angry', 'hurt', 'are', 'remember', 'pray', 'guidance', 'wisdom', 'strength', 'scene', 'found', 'rather', 'interesting', 'where', 'Craig', 'Darby', 'have', 'argument', 'Craig', 'Darby', 'home', 'Bible', 'look', 'living', 'room', 'Craig', 'there', 'jogging', 'back', 'forth', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Craig', 'was', 'praying', 'hard', 'soul', 'so', 'forth', 'was', 'rather', 'interesting', 'portrayed', 'way', 'best', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Youth', 'Revival', 'where', 'Darby', 'seeing', 'love', 'Jesus', 'Craig', 'eyes', 'very', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'song', 'can', 'find', 'somewhere', 'cd', 'will', 'buy', 'Craig', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'peace', 'Darby', 'will', 'be', 'heaven', 'when', ""'ll"", 'have', 'somewhat', 'life', 'done', 'up', 'rather', 'well', 'when', 'Darby', 'family', 'trip', 'Craig', 'memoirs', 'Craig', 'know', 'Darby', 'too', 'say', 'geared', 'towards', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'rebound', 'divorce', 'being', 'widowed', 'can', 'be', 'still', 'inspiring', 'can', 'help', 'ignite', 'passions', 'again', 'can', 'also', 'remind', 'seek', 'Lord', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'times', 'still', 'worth', 'watching']",Love Note

However, it touch us deeply as the young man who knows the new girl in his school little by little has really good intentions and always asks help to God. He uses to go to church and at the same time falls in love with the girl and makes her change her mind about hopelessness as she is dying of a brain cancer. He makes her love God and believe in his eternal love. This story makes us feel emotinal and feel we are not alone and someone beyond all powers loves us and gave his life for us. Watch it without fear of crying, after all the tears shed are not in vain. I only gave 4 stars as in my opinion the film is very short, around 65 minutes.. otherwise I would have given 5 stars.",4,Everlasting love!,1223078400,"10 4, 2008",2008,747,"['could', 'have', 'been', 'typical', 'tear', 'jerker', 'movie', '80', 'However', 'touch', 'deeply', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'new', 'girl', 'school', 'little', 'little', 'really', 'good', 'intentions', 'always', 'help', 'God', 'go', 'church', 'same', 'time', 'love', 'girl', 'change', 'mind', 'about', 'hopelessness', 'dying', 'brain', 'cancer', 'love', 'God', 'believe', 'eternal', 'love', 'story', 'feel', 'emotinal', 'feel', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'someone', 'powers', 'loves', 'gave', 'life', 'Watch', 'fear', 'crying', 'tears', 'shed', 'are', 'not', 'vain', 'only', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'opinion', 'film', 'very', 'short', '65', 'minutes..', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars']",Love Note

I think this movie is a lot like Fireproof- a christian message around a couple in love.I don't want to give too much away, but the main character Craig is a christian young man that is looking for more in life than just the ordinary. He then meets the girl that will become the love of his life... the story evolves around them. He teaches her things, but the most important the true way to salvation, and encourages her to have a relationship with God.I highly recommend this film for anyone looking for a good Christian love story... and like the other reviews mentioned.. you will probably cry like my friends and I did!",5,AMAZING (:,1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,883,"['love', 'christian', 'movies', 'movies', 'have', 'powerful', 'Godly', 'message', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'christian', 'movies', '1', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'granted', 'was', 'filmed', '80', 'early', '90', 'still', 'AMAZING', 'none', 'less', 'think', 'movie', 'lot', 'Fireproof-', 'christian', 'message', 'couple', 'love.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'main', 'character', 'Craig', 'christian', 'young', 'man', 'looking', 'more', 'life', 'just', 'ordinary', 'then', 'girl', 'will', 'become', 'love', 'life', 'story', 'things', 'most', 'important', 'true', 'way', 'salvation', 'have', 'relationship', 'God.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'looking', 'good', 'Christian', 'love', 'story', 'other', 'reviews', 'mentioned..', 'will', 'probably', 'cry', 'friends', 'did']",Love Note
