Childers ""Wes Childers""","[68, 73]","Having been a loyal fan of ""Unsolved Mysteries"", I was pleasantly suprised when First Look Media released the various DVD boxed sets (""Ghosts"", ""UFOs"", ""Bizarre Murders"", ""Miracles"", ""Psychics"" and ""Strange Legends"")awhile back. While the respective sets were far from perfect in their content, they nevertheless were able to whet my appetite for the time being as I anxiously awaited more volumes. So imagine my suprise when I discovered that First Look media would be releasing a ""Best Of Unsolved Mysteries"" DVD collection. It seemed to be a great excuse to cull segments from the many seasons' worth of UM episodes. Perhaps some of the more (in)famous segments would finally be brought to digital life. Suffice it to say, that is simply not the case here. Sure, you get an extra bonus DVD featuring five ""ghost"" segments and five ""treasure"" segments as well as a less-than-generous sprinkling of new segments throughout the rest of the collection. However, the vast bulk of the collection is composed of segments found in the various aforementioned boxed sets. While this may appeal to newer fans and/or those who did not want to buy the categorized sets, it is a major letdown to fans who already own them. Barring any legal or copyright issues, one has to wonder why First Look didn't mine the rich UM archive for more segments. While the new segments included in this collection are fascinating, it nevertheless leaves fans of the UM DVDs wanting more---a whole lot more.With near-perfect picture and sound quality, this set makes for a great gift for casual fans.
