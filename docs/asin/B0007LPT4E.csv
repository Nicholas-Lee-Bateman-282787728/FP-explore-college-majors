Great episode, and the introduction of Maes Hughes, one of my favorite characters. Then the great episode ""The Alchemy Exam"" where Ed discovers he can transmutate without a circle. Then there is one of the finest episodes of the series, ""Night of the Chimera's Cry,"" which introduces Scar.

882421,A2E1NBEF19ZFN4,B0007LPT4E,Anonymous,"[1, 2]","First I'd like to begin by stating the obvious:  Fullmetal Alchemist is an amazing anime with wonderful, fleshed-out characters, deep and interesting relationships, great action, an intriguing plot, and because of all of this it's my all-around favorite anime.  The humor and drama are all well-executed, the world where the story takes place is engaging, there's plenty of mystery and intrigue, and it's easy to feel close to the characters.  Even if you're not the type of person who likes every anime under the sun (or maybe you don't tend to like anime at all), I still recommend checking this out, you won't be disappointed.As for the disc Volume 5 itself, it contains four episodes (like all of the others), and the last episode of the disc is certainly enough of a cliffhanger to make the next disc's release seem all too far away.  Exciting stuff here.  Some mystery is brewing, along with a big revelation that I won't be revealing  :)The extras on the DVD are pretty cool, my absolute favorite being the actors' commentary.  This is the only volume with any commentary up to this point.  It is hysterical and very entertaining, highly recommended!  Just make sure you've finished the disc without the commentary the first go around as otherwise there are some spoilers.  Again, excellent commentary!My only complaint (as with all of the DVDs that have been released for this series) is that there is always a trailer/preview/advertisement preceding the main menu screen that cannot be skipped (at least, not without some cunning!).  However, it is well worth the wait because this series is absolutely captivating!  Don't miss out!",5,A new mystery and a shocking revelation.

882422,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B0007LPT4E,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[1, 1]","In my reviews of the last volumes, I made it quite clear that I love almost everything about Fullmetal Alchemist, including the story, characters, soundtrack, and animation. For this review, I've decided to concentrate on the action of the series, especially since in this volume, the Fall of Ishbal, the action is heavy.In the first episode, Edward Elric faces off with Mustang in the hopes to earn some valuable information as well as to find a home for an abandoned kitten that Alphonse has found. This fight is nothing short of hilarious, yet still contains a lot of explosive action. In episode two, Destruction's Right Hand, the Brothers Elric find themselves the target of a mysterious, scarred man who has the power to shatter brains from the inside. All of the fights with this character are amazing, and these battles continue on into the third episode. Finally, though, the action stops as the brothers must journey back to there hometown for general R&R.;Though the entire series had quite a few impressive battle sequences, this volume contained the best so far. I was floored by the battle in the first episode on this DVD between Fullmetal and the Flame. The detail and the break-neck pace was breath-taking, and not only that but it stayed light and funny, adding elements of comedy while keeping the intensity strong. And since it's still relatively early in the series, the promise of a lot more action is just another thing that keeps me hooked. FMA is turning slowly into one of the greatest anime ever created (but not yet, at least in my view).",5,The Brothers Fight,1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,1566,"['reviews', 'last', 'volumes', 'made', 'quite', 'clear', 'love', 'almost', 'everything', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'including', 'story', 'characters', 'soundtrack', 'animation', 'review', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'concentrate', 'action', 'series', 'especially', 'volume', 'Fall', 'Ishbal', 'action', 'first', 'episode', 'Edward', 'Elric', 'off', 'Mustang', 'hopes', 'earn', 'valuable', 'information', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'home', 'abandoned', 'kitten', 'Alphonse', 'found', 'fight', 'nothing', 'short', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'still', 'lot', 'explosive', 'action', 'episode', 'two', 'Destruction', 'Right', 'Hand', 'Brothers', 'Elric', 'find', 'target', 'mysterious', 'scarred', 'man', 'who', 'power', 'shatter', 'brains', 'inside', 'fights', 'character', 'are', 'amazing', 'battles', 'continue', 'third', 'episode', 'Finally', 'though', 'action', 'brothers', 'must', 'journey', 'back', 'hometown', 'general', 'R', 'R', 'entire', 'series', 'had', 'quite', 'few', 'impressive', 'battle', 'sequences', 'volume', 'contained', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'was', 'floored', 'battle', 'first', 'episode', 'DVD', 'Fullmetal', 'Flame', 'detail', 'break-neck', 'pace', 'was', 'breath-taking', 'not', 'only', 'stayed', 'light', 'funny', 'adding', 'elements', 'comedy', 'keeping', 'intensity', 'strong', 'still', 'relatively', 'early', 'series', 'promise', 'lot', 'more', 'action', 'just', 'thing', 'hooked', 'FMA', 'turning', 'slowly', 'one', 'greatest', 'anime', 'ever', 'created', 'not', 'yet', 'least', 'view']",Fullmetal Alchemist: Volume 2 - Scarred Man of the East - Episodes 5-8

882424,AIGXHWEKBFNN6,B0007LPT4E,"Christopher ""chris_at_amazon""","[1, 3]","Okay, watching FMA: The Curse (Vol 1 DVD) was my first time experiencing such a great anime series---perhaps the best anime series ever made (next to Naruto, if not even better).  I fell in love with FMA even more so after having finished watching this Vol 2 DVD (The Scarred Man of the East).  The story is so touching, and I think I just found one of the saddest storyline ever written for an anime series.  I love Nina Tucker - and only wish that her character will return...somehow.  But it'll probably just be wishful thinking on my part.  Anyway, IMO, Volume 2 is even better than the first one.  Just watch Episode 6 (or the second episode in this Vol. 2 dvd...entitled The Examination Day or something like it...) and you will know exactly what I mean.  Now I just can't wait till May 31st, till Volume 3 comes out!  BTW, Funimation did a really good job with the english dub.  The voices they chose for the characters actually sound a lot like their Japanese counterparts (compare 'em for yourself 'cuz the original japanese audio option is also available in this DVD).  The storyline is superb (could you expect anything less from Square-Enix???).  Get this now and enjoy.

882426,A2DK2OY6R3WICK,B0007LPT4E,C.W. Fitch,"[8, 8]","The latest installment of one of the best anime series in the past couple of years advances through its compelling story.  The action is about to reach a fever pitch, and revelations will be discovered.In Vol. 5, Ed and Alphonse Elric pay a visit to their old hometown for repairs after their first battle with Scar.  The aptly named Major Armstrong, appointed to watch over the brothers, accompanies them home.  After a rather unemotional reunion with their childhood friend Winry and her grandma and a visit to their mother's grave, the Elrics get put back together again and head for Central to seek more information about creating a genuine Philosopher's Stone.  What they discover there may change their course of action and their whole motivation for creating it.  Meanwhile, as Scar resumes his search for the Elrics, he encounters the Homunculi Lust and Gluttony and barely escapes with his life.  The military is also looking for Scar to bring him to justice for the murders he's committed.During their detective work, Ed and Al come across a pair of assassins who seemingly have close ties to the brothers, and make a few new discoveries about themselves as they engage in fierce battle.Confused yet?  Well, if you're here, I certainly hope you are at least familiar with the story leading up to this volume.  ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" is well into its second season with this chapter (Episodes 17-20), and it is moving along at such an intriguing pace that I find myself marking Vol. 6's release date on my calendar.  This is one anime series that pulls no punches emotionally, and reaches its audience by one shocking plot device and/or twist after another.  The series, set in an unrevealed time period but teeming with technology and magic (in this case, two great tastes that go great together), does a wonderful job of grabbing hold of the viewer and keeping them locked in to every detail, character, and story element.  As the series progresses, you'll actually identify with Edward and Alphonse and their terrible plight.  You'll watch them grow and mature, and even feel for them as they come closer and get further away from the goal of their quest with each episode.  The entire supporting cast is chock full of memorable characters as well, especially the other State Alchemists (my personal fave being Alex Luis Armstrong at the moment).  At certain times, mostly during the beginning of the series, slapstick elements and humor even inject themselves beautifully into the mix.  At this point in the series, though, the story's taken a very serious turn, although every once in a while a poke at Ed's height (which happens at least once an episode) or Alchemist Hughes showing off pictures of his infant daughter breaks up the somberness.Talk about a series that's got it all together.  Whether you're a fan of sci-fi or fantasy anime (or both), or you just want to watch a deep, intriguing story with incredible and memorable characters, this is the one.  The dubbing, usually one of the most critiqued elements in anime, is absolutely excellent: Al's and Ed's English voices, especially, capture their every emotion with expert precision.  I can't imagine the difficulty in voice-acting a 10-year-old boy without a body whose soul is trapped in a case of armor, but darn it, it's nailed here.  Top it all off with a rawking opening theme from J-pop legends L'arc-en-Ciel (""Ready, Steady, Go""), and you've got a winner for the ages.  The only minor aggravation I found with this volume, though, was in the way the DVD is set up:  FUNimation forces you to watch a 2   minute preview of the latest volume of (the albeit slick-looking) ""Samurai 7"" and a small blurb for another series before the menu even comes up.  (I've seen this on other discs before; don't know if this is a flaw, but if every copy's like that, it should be an extra on the disc rather than shoved down our collective throats at the beginning.)  Do not miss this series; if you haven't seen it up to now, back up and look for Vol. 1 this instant!  You won't regret it.",5,"Fullmetal gets deeper, and even better.",1129766400,"10 20, 2005",2005,4058,"['latest', 'installment', 'one', 'best', 'anime', 'series', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'advances', 'compelling', 'story', 'action', 'reach', 'fever', 'pitch', 'revelations', 'will', 'be', 'discovered.In', 'Vol', '5', 'Ed', 'Alphonse', 'Elric', 'pay', 'visit', 'old', 'hometown', 'repairs', 'first', 'battle', 'Scar', 'aptly', 'named', 'Major', 'Armstrong', 'appointed', 'watch', 'brothers', 'home', 'rather', 'unemotional', 'reunion', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Winry', 'grandma', 'visit', 'mother', 'grave', 'Elrics', 'get', 'put', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'head', 'Central', 'seek', 'more', 'information', 'creating', 'genuine', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'What', 'discover', 'there', 'may', 'change', 'course', 'action', 'whole', 'motivation', 'creating', 'Meanwhile', 'Scar', 'search', 'Elrics', 'Homunculi', 'Lust', 'Gluttony', 'barely', 'escapes', 'life', 'military', 'also', 'looking', 'Scar', 'bring', 'justice', 'murders', 'committed.During', 'detective', 'work', 'Ed', 'Al', 'come', 'pair', 'assassins', 'who', 'seemingly', 'have', 'close', 'ties', 'brothers', 'make', 'few', 'new', 'discoveries', 'about', 'engage', 'fierce', 'battle.Confused', 'yet', 'Well', ""'re"", 'here', 'certainly', 'hope', 'are', 'least', 'familiar', 'story', 'leading', 'up', 'volume', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'well', 'second', 'season', 'chapter', 'Episodes', '17-20', 'moving', 'along', 'such', 'intriguing', 'pace', 'find', 'marking', 'Vol', '6', 'release', 'date', 'calendar', 'one', 'anime', 'series', 'punches', 'emotionally', 'audience', 'one', 'shocking', 'plot', 'device', 'twist', 'series', 'set', 'unrevealed', 'time', 'period', 'teeming', 'technology', 'magic', 'case', 'two', 'great', 'tastes', 'go', 'great', 'together', 'wonderful', 'job', 'grabbing', 'hold', 'viewer', 'keeping', 'locked', 'detail', 'character', 'story', 'element', 'series', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'identify', 'Edward', 'Alphonse', 'terrible', 'plight', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'grow', 'mature', 'even', 'feel', 'come', 'closer', 'get', 'further', 'away', 'goal', 'quest', 'episode', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'chock', 'full', 'memorable', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'other', 'State', 'Alchemists', 'personal', 'fave', 'being', 'Alex', 'Luis', 'Armstrong', 'moment', 'certain', 'times', 'mostly', 'beginning', 'series', 'slapstick', 'elements', 'humor', 'even', 'inject', 'beautifully', 'mix', 'point', 'series', 'story', 'taken', 'very', 'serious', 'turn', 'once', 'while', 'poke', 'Ed', 'height', 'least', 'once', 'episode', 'Alchemist', 'Hughes', 'showing', 'off', 'pictures', 'infant', 'daughter', 'up', 'somberness.Talk', 'series', 'got', 'together', 'Whether', ""'re"", 'fan', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'anime', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'deep', 'intriguing', 'story', 'incredible', 'memorable', 'characters', 'one', 'dubbing', 'usually', 'one', 'most', 'critiqued', 'elements', 'anime', 'absolutely', 'excellent', 'Al', 'Ed', 'English', 'voices', 'especially', 'capture', 'emotion', 'expert', 'precision', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'difficulty', 'voice-acting', '10-year-old', 'boy', 'body', 'soul', 'trapped', 'case', 'armor', 'darn', 'nailed', 'here', 'Top', 'off', 'rawking', 'opening', 'theme', 'J-pop', ""L'arc-en-Ciel"", 'Ready', 'Steady', 'Go', ""'ve"", 'got', 'winner', 'ages', 'only', 'minor', 'aggravation', 'found', 'volume', 'was', 'way', 'DVD', 'set', 'up', 'FUNimation', 'forces', 'watch', '2', 'minute', 'preview', 'latest', 'volume', 'albeit', 'slick-looking', '7', 'small', 'blurb', 'series', 'menu', 'even', 'up', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'discs', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'flaw', 'copy', 'should', 'be', 'extra', 'disc', 'rather', 'shoved', 'down', 'collective', 'throats', 'beginning', 'Do', 'not', 'miss', 'series', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'now', 'back', 'look', 'Vol', '1', 'instant', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",Fullmetal Alchemist: Volume 2 - Scarred Man of the East - Episodes 5-8

882432,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B0007LPT4E,Sesho,"[1, 1]","When Ed and Al return to Eastern HQ, with a stray cat hidden in Al's armor, they are full of questions about the mysterious Dr. Marcoh, who possibly researched the Philosopher's Stone. As we all know, Ed's hunger for this knowledge knows few bounds. When he realizes Mustang knows more than he's telling, Ed requests that his annual assessment by the State Alechemists be a combat one, pitting him against Mustang. If he wins, Mustang will cough up the info.....and take care of the cat! Meanwhile, Scar, the frightening killer that has been executing State Alchemists, is making his way towards the East and we finally learn what his grudge is. Ed and Al also find out that the State Alchemists past is one that is clouded with blood.Another installment in a classic show. The first episode is a bit more humorous than the current story arc. The showdown between Ed and Mustang is more comic than deadly. But Full Metal doesn't hold back on the violence when it has too either, or the sadness and tragedy as we find out about a 10 year old massacre perpetrated by a government driven mad with power against defenseless rebels, and sanctioned by the Alchemists. Things get more and more intriguing. Fantastic show.Extras: Video for the new theme song by L'Arc en Ciel, Openings/Closings, Production art and image gallery, Character profiles. Also the first episode of the anime Spiral.",5,I THINK I KILLED SOME PEOPLE,1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,1385,"['When', 'Ed', 'Al', 'return', 'Eastern', 'HQ', 'stray', 'cat', 'hidden', 'Al', 'armor', 'are', 'full', 'questions', 'mysterious', 'Dr.', 'Marcoh', 'who', 'possibly', 'researched', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'know', 'Ed', 'hunger', 'knowledge', 'few', 'bounds', 'When', 'Mustang', 'more', 'telling', 'Ed', 'annual', 'assessment', 'State', 'Alechemists', 'be', 'combat', 'one', 'pitting', 'Mustang', 'Mustang', 'will', 'cough', 'up', 'info', '..and', 'take', 'care', 'cat', 'Meanwhile', 'Scar', 'frightening', 'killer', 'been', 'executing', 'State', 'Alchemists', 'making', 'way', 'East', 'finally', 'learn', 'what', 'grudge', 'Ed', 'Al', 'also', 'find', 'out', 'State', 'Alchemists', 'past', 'one', 'clouded', 'installment', 'classic', 'show', 'first', 'episode', 'bit', 'more', 'humorous', 'current', 'story', 'arc', 'showdown', 'Ed', 'Mustang', 'more', 'comic', 'deadly', 'Full', 'Metal', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'violence', 'when', 'too', 'either', 'sadness', 'tragedy', 'find', 'out', '10', 'year', 'old', 'massacre', 'perpetrated', 'government', 'driven', 'mad', 'power', 'defenseless', 'rebels', 'sanctioned', 'Alchemists', 'Things', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'intriguing', 'Fantastic', 'show.Extras', 'Video', 'new', 'theme', 'song', ""L'Arc"", 'en', 'Ciel', 'Openings/Closings', 'Production', 'art', 'image', 'gallery', 'Character', 'profiles', 'Also', 'first', 'episode', 'anime', 'Spiral']",Fullmetal Alchemist: Volume 2 - Scarred Man of the East - Episodes 5-8
882433,A1PJG1JBG3FZ5D,B0007LPT4E,"Takai ""Anime Obsessed""","[1, 1]","This series was one, I had to buy as a DVD Collection one-by-one. Seeing as how I don't have cable (nor any use for it), I was at a friends house who was watching Full Metal Alchemist, in the middle of the series. Without giving it away, let's just say it was a semi battle between Edward and Scar.The storyline for Full Metal Alchemist is very detailed, and good at not giving away anything big until it actually happens in the story. It's not your typical ""Oh I expected that to happen"" kind of things, it's more of a ""Whoa, that came out of nowhere!"" kind of story. Vol.2 Picks up right where Vol. 1 left off. Edward and Al pick up on their trail to find the philosophers stone, which seems more and more difficult to obtain. They encounter old friends and gain new friends, along the way they also lose some friends.This part of the story-line is more of Edward and Al's test of emotions rather than strength. With that said, it's perfect for the collection of FMA for plot development, but if you're buying it just for action, look the other way. Not too much of that going on with the exception of a few scenes.",5,Full Metal Perfection,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,1117,"['series', 'was', 'one', 'had', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Collection', 'one-by-one', 'Seeing', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable', 'use', 'was', 'friends', 'house', 'who', 'was', 'watching', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Alchemist', 'middle', 'series', 'giving', 'away', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'was', 'semi', 'battle', 'Edward', 'Scar.The', 'storyline', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Alchemist', 'very', 'detailed', 'good', 'not', 'giving', 'away', 'anything', 'big', 'actually', 'story', 'not', 'typical', 'Oh', 'expected', 'happen', 'kind', 'things', 'more', 'Whoa', 'came', 'nowhere', 'kind', 'story', 'Vol.2', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'Vol', '1', 'left', 'off', 'Edward', 'Al', 'pick', 'up', 'trail', 'find', 'philosophers', 'stone', 'more', 'more', 'difficult', 'obtain', 'encounter', 'old', 'friends', 'gain', 'new', 'friends', 'way', 'also', 'lose', 'friends.This', 'part', 'story-line', 'more', 'Edward', 'Al', 'test', 'emotions', 'rather', 'strength', 'said', 'perfect', 'collection', 'FMA', 'plot', 'development', ""'re"", 'buying', 'just', 'action', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'Not', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'exception', 'few', 'scenes']",Fullmetal Alchemist: Volume 2 - Scarred Man of the East - Episodes 5-8
