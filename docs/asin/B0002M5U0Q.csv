Since it's two hours long, that pretty much tells you how much I enjoy this.If you like to ""boogie"" with toe-tapping, feel-good oldies - and what true rock 'n roller doesn't? - this is a great find. It's cheap here, too, at Amazon - an incredible bargain.Bill Wyman, the long-time (30 years) bassist for the Rolling Stones, formed his own group - a bunch of great musicians and singers - who just like to have fun and a have a great time performing rock songs of the past, along with a few jazz, soul and other genres.The ""guitarists' guitarist,"" Albert Lee, joins Wyman along with the great singer/keyboardist Georgie Fame, two lively sax players, a Nina Simone-type singer, a drummer, another guitarist and a guy named Mike Sanchez who is one of the best entertainers I've ever seen.I can't stop smiling every time I play this DVD.",5,Two Hours Of Feel-Good Old Time Rock 'N Roll,1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,969,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'found', 'out', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'sure', 'glad', 'did', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'disc', 'week', 'played', 'three', 'times', 'already', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'pretty', 'much', 'tells', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', 'this.If', 'like', 'boogie', 'toe-tapping', 'feel-good', 'oldies', 'what', 'true', 'rock', 'n', 'roller', ""n't"", 'great', 'find', 'cheap', 'here', 'too', 'Amazon', 'incredible', 'bargain.Bill', 'Wyman', 'long-time', '30', 'years', 'bassist', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'formed', 'own', 'group', 'bunch', 'great', 'musicians', 'singers', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'performing', 'rock', 'songs', 'past', 'few', 'jazz', 'soul', 'other', 'genres.The', 'guitarists', 'guitarist', 'Albert', 'Lee', 'Wyman', 'great', 'singer/keyboardist', 'Georgie', 'Fame', 'two', 'lively', 'sax', 'players', 'Nina', 'Simone-type', 'singer', 'drummer', 'guitarist', 'guy', 'named', 'Mike', 'Sanchez', 'who', 'one', 'best', 'entertainers', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'smiling', 'time', 'play', 'DVD']",N/A
