563850,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,B000051YMP,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[10, 12]","His best: social journalism.  Nobody brings perennially pressing issues to the screen as consistently and vitally as Spike Lee---love or hate his films as you may, there's no argument that he does a superb job of provoking debate and reflection.  Here it's Lee's two favorite topics, racial history/injustice/relations and (less prominently but still significant) gender/sexual issues...treated with a vast amount of humor and often insight.His worst: at times some of his films implode when Lee gets on his soapbox and goes too heavy-handed---the Message blots out the Movie.  This happens towards the last one-third, with the last 10 minutes especially preachy and contrived.  The film craft breaks down, characters and dialogue that before had been pretty much spot-on suddenly verge into labored allegory and caricature.It's like Lee drew up a laundry list of Pressing Societal Problems (brings to mind Larwence Kasdan's ""Grand Canyon"") and tried to allot 5-10 minutes for each one.  Sometimes he does so with grace and wit, but sometimes he stumbles into glibness and stereotyping.I was a little disappointed that Lee didn't show more of the actual Million Man march, maybe explore the controversial Louis Farrakhan a little bit more deeply.  I was however pleasantly surprisd that Lee does take a fairly mature, gutsy stand on homosexuality and homophobia absent in some of his earlier films.Had Lee made this film more as a straight (or pointed) documentary rather than trying to turn it into a heavy-handed inspirational treatise, I'd gladly give it 5 plus stars.

Its passengers consist of about twenty men, and a teenager played by De'Aundre Bonds overacting his role, all headed to The Million (black) Man March; a potentially historic civil rights event held by Louis Farrakhan in Washington DC. But you don't have to support the cause in order to enjoy the ride. There's enough dynamic characterization and dialogue to hold your attention for the most part. It's when we start leaving the bus one too many times, for conflict and drama during the movie's second half, that things go from good to not-so-good. The plot tries to do too much as it goes from a documentary-style social commentary to an emotional wreck. Imagine fist fights and father-son therapy sessions with contemporary soul music playing in the background.
