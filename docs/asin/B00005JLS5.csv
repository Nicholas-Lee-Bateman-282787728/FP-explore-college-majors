One of my favorite aspects of this show is how we get to travel around the world with Eliza and her family, experiencing different cultures, customs and sometimes languages.  I think I'd have loved this show even without the fascinating 'talking to animals' thing.This is a great series for getting people interested in other parts of our world.  I also deeply appreciate the way it makes you care about animals/the environment, not in a preachy sort of way, but YOU care because ELIZA and her family care, to the point of being willing to risk their lives.There is also an awesome movie you absolutely cannot miss out on-it's a whole lot less expensive than the series, and is a good starting point if you want to try a bit of the series before jumping in the water.

605025,A3SJ5A6L2FRGGW,B00005JLS5,Keith_Joseph,"[0, 0]","The family (mum, dad, daughter 10, son 8) saw this at the cinema and really enjoyed it. Its works well as a DVD on the small screen as well and has quite a serious storyline, although to honest our kids have only watched it a few times, so perhaps try renting as well. Our children prefered to watch their many hours of TV Wild Thornberry episodes on video instead, as there is far more variety. However this is a very successful movie translation with quite a strong story for kids. It's not unlike Tarzan really with it's England public school sequences. Your children would probably appreciate it more if they are familiar with the TV series (but then they will have probably seen it already), and unfortunately the TV series isn't being screened much at the moment. I think the film will still make perfect sense if you aren't familiar The Wild Thornberries (it's just the exact reason why Eliza can talk to animals that is glossed over). I preferred this movie to the later 'Rugrat's go wild'. It's particularly of interest to a UK audience as Nigel Thornberry is very 1950s English, and a cross between David Attenborough and George Sanders (Sheer Khan in The Jungle Book). Plus any film with Brit Tim Curry involved is always fun (the voice of Nigel). There's also Lynn Redgrave as Cordelia Thornberry - Nigel's mum. The film particularly suites girls as both main leads are girls (although the animal action sequences keep the young men happy). Highly recommended for a 5 to 11 audience (and their parents), particularly as now it's an old title, it's quite cheap.",4,A good movie spin off from the clever TV series,1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,1572,"['family', 'mum', 'dad', 'daughter', '10', 'son', '8', 'saw', 'cinema', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'works', 'well', 'DVD', 'small', 'screen', 'as', 'well', 'quite', 'serious', 'storyline', 'honest', 'kids', 'have', 'only', 'watched', 'few', 'times', 'perhaps', 'try', 'renting', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'prefered', 'watch', 'many', 'hours', 'TV', 'Wild', 'Thornberry', 'video', 'instead', 'far', 'more', 'variety', 'However', 'very', 'successful', 'movie', 'translation', 'strong', 'story', 'kids', 'not', 'Tarzan', 'really', 'England', 'public', 'school', 'sequences', 'children', 'would', 'probably', 'appreciate', 'more', 'are', 'familiar', 'TV', 'series', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'probably', 'seen', 'already', 'unfortunately', 'TV', 'series', ""n't"", 'being', 'screened', 'much', 'moment', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'still', 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Wild', 'Thornberries', 'just', 'exact', 'reason', 'why', 'Eliza', 'can', 'talk', 'animals', 'glossed', 'preferred', 'movie', 'later', ""'Rugrat"", 'go', 'wild', 'particularly', 'interest', 'UK', 'audience', 'Nigel', 'Thornberry', 'very', '1950s', 'English', 'cross', 'David', 'Attenborough', 'George', 'Sanders', 'Sheer', 'Khan', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'film', 'Brit', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'involved', 'always', 'fun', 'voice', 'Nigel', 'also', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'Cordelia', 'Thornberry', 'Nigel', 'mum', 'film', 'particularly', 'girls', 'main', 'leads', 'are', 'girls', 'animal', 'action', 'sequences', 'keep', 'young', 'men', 'happy', 'Highly', 'recommended', '5', '11', 'audience', 'parents', 'particularly', 'as', 'now', 'old', 'title', 'quite', 'cheap']",The Wild Thornberrys Movie

605031,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B00005JLS5,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","I have always enjoyed the Wild Thornberrys.  The premise was cool, the characters were interesting and well-developed (especially as the show moved along), and there was an attempt to portray many different cultures as this family literally traveled around the world.  These attempts weren't always successful, but I'll let that go along with the fact that I could never get a motor home as cool as the one that the Thornberrys had.  When this movie came along, it didn't simply take a half-hour episode's content and stretch it out for the theaters' benefit.  It created a continuation of a story that was perfect for the big screen while allowing the show to subsequently pick up on some of its specific plot threads.  Eliza Thornberry and her Chimpanzee companion, Darwin, witness the abduction of a Cheetah cub by poachers.  Eliza tries to save her four-legged friend but fails and, because of the danger she put herself in in the process, is sent to a British boarding school at the insistence of her overprotective grandmother.  Sure that the Cheetah cub is still alive, Eliza resolves to return to Africa and find him and the poachers before more harm befalls anyone.  That's easier said than done and the movie gives a proper amount of time to all aspects of this plan and the setbacks that come along.  It is also laced with talented guest stars including Rupert Everett, Marisa Tomei, Kimberly Brooks, and Tim Curry, who, in addition to his starring role as Nigel Thornberry, voices his own father...just listen to the family resemblance.  Speaking of Nigel, I think that, in this movie, he proves his capabilities as a father more than in any episode of the show, despite his quirky mannerisms...just listen to his chat with Eliza right before her departure for boarding school...Paul Simon's song is definitely appropriate right after that.  This is a top-notch Nickelodeon project for the big screen and no one should miss it.

I've seen every episode (many more than once), and I was a little skeptical at the thought of a full-length animated movie.Happily, the movie far surpassed my wildest expectations. The animation looks great, including the use of several CGI elements not present in the series (at some moments it reminded me of ""The Lion King""). There is enough background information included (including the opening credits of the series) that newcomers won't feel left behind. The whole Thornberry gang is here, including the addition of Nigel's parents, and several new characters as well. The voice work is fantastic, including such well-known names as Tim Curry as Nigel, Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea as Donnie, Rupert Everett as the baddie, and Marisa Tomei. The music is an eclectic mix of traditional and modern, featuring such talents as Sting, Dave Matthews, P. Diddy and Brandy, Youssou D'Nour, Sting, Baha Men, Nick Carter, Peter Gabriel and Hugh Masekela.The story finds Eliza Thornberry, a twelve-year old with the magical ability to talk to animals, on a hunt for migrating elephants with her family, who are award-winning naturalists. Eliza's older sister Debbie is a moody, pop culture-obsessed Valley Girl who hates all the wilderness trekking. Donnie is the Bornean wild boy that the Thornberrys adopted, who is always causing trouble by making messes and stuffing things up his nose or down his pants. Darwin is Eliza's best friend, a chimpanzee with very human tastes, including his obsession with Cheese Munchies. Eliza starts out playing with the cubs of a cheetah friend, but when one of them is stolen by a poacher Eliza must rescue him. However, her parents send her to a London boarding school, where Eliza is miserable and doesn't fit in. The rest of the movie you'll have to see to believe!There are some scary chase scenes, wounded animals and tense moments that might upset younger viewers, but overall ""The Thornberrys Movie"" does an excellent job of bringing the show to the big screen while remaining faithful to the humour, excellent ethnic music, and magical elements of the original series. One of the things that I love the most about the ""Wild Thornberrys"" is that the episodes take viewers all around the world, and the show's producers try to avoid ethnic stereotypes with the various characters, as well as adding authentic music and traditions. This is one cartoon that is witty, educational and downright fun for the whole family.
