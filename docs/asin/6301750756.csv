He had great chemistry with all of his co-stars including the beautiful and talented Miss Ilona Massey.

I highly recommend all of his movies.",5,Great Movie!,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,403,"['think', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Nelson', 'Eddy', 'singing', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'enjoy', 'listening', 'sing', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'co-stars', 'including', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Miss', 'Ilona', 'Massey', 'just', 'recently', 'saw', 'Mr.', 'Eddy', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'movie', 'Miss', 'Susanna', 'Foster', 'were', 'excellent', 'together', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movies']",N/A
263942,A14CLM6MITNDM8,6301750756,B. Wilson,"[6, 7]","Nelson Eddy (Capt. Jim Lawrence) is convincing in his role of the U.S. Army officer providing protection against the Indians, as well as law and order to the citizens of a Russian settlement in pre-statehood California.  As always Eddy's voice is wonderful and the viewer is treated to him singing a hymn in Russian.  In addition, he proves his excellent horsemanship by performing most of his own stunts.  All that's missing is a convincing storyline romance.Ilona Massey never quite measures up in her role of Natalia Alanova, a woman who arrives at the settlement on a ship from Russia.  While Natalia's visit is seemingly innocent, she is actually there on a mission to find her husband (a prisoner on a chain gang), and to help him escape in order to ensure his silence about her father's involvement in a plot against the Czar. She doesn't count on falling in love with Capt. Lawrence and the need to betray him in order to carry out her plot is the dilemma faced by the lead characters.  The script forces the story romance to develop too quickly which makes it unconvincing.Jeanette MacDonald (the original intended female lead) would have been far superior to Massey in voice, warmth of personality and acting skills.  And the chemistry, created by the life-long real life romance between Eddy & MacDonald, that always came through so clearly in their movies together, is non-existent between Massey and Eddy and therefore adds to the unconvincing storyline romance.The stand outs in the cast are Hugo Haas (womanizing Prince Nikolai) & Elsa Lanchester (his long suffering, but wise wife, Princess Tanya).  Their scenes together and with Eddy are the highlight of the movie. And Joseph Schildkraut (Count Igor Savin) is convincingly evil as Natalia's scheming, blackmailing husband.The story line of this movie actually had great possibilities with the right leads and it is a shame Nelson Eddy wasn't given a better fare for his last movie role.  But whenever there's a chance to hear him sing it is worth the time to watch the movie. For that reason, I give it 4 stars.",4,No Chemistry Between the Lead Actors,1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,2080,"['Nelson', 'Eddy', 'Capt', 'Jim', 'Lawrence', 'convincing', 'role', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'officer', 'providing', 'protection', 'Indians', 'as', 'well', 'law', 'order', 'citizens', 'Russian', 'settlement', 'pre-statehood', 'California', 'always', 'Eddy', 'voice', 'wonderful', 'viewer', 'treated', 'singing', 'hymn', 'Russian', 'addition', 'excellent', 'horsemanship', 'performing', 'most', 'own', 'stunts', 'missing', 'convincing', 'storyline', 'romance.Ilona', 'Massey', 'never', 'quite', 'up', 'role', 'Natalia', 'Alanova', 'woman', 'who', 'settlement', 'ship', 'Russia', 'Natalia', 'visit', 'seemingly', 'innocent', 'actually', 'there', 'mission', 'find', 'husband', 'prisoner', 'chain', 'gang', 'help', 'escape', 'order', 'ensure', 'silence', 'father', 'involvement', 'plot', 'Czar', ""n't"", 'count', 'falling', 'love', 'Capt', 'Lawrence', 'need', 'betray', 'order', 'carry', 'out', 'plot', 'dilemma', 'faced', 'lead', 'characters', 'script', 'story', 'romance', 'develop', 'too', 'quickly', 'unconvincing.Jeanette', 'MacDonald', 'original', 'intended', 'female', 'lead', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'superior', 'Massey', 'voice', 'warmth', 'personality', 'acting', 'skills', 'chemistry', 'created', 'life-long', 'real', 'life', 'romance', 'Eddy', 'MacDonald', 'always', 'came', 'so', 'clearly', 'movies', 'together', 'non-existent', 'Massey', 'Eddy', 'therefore', 'unconvincing', 'storyline', 'romance.The', 'stand', 'outs', 'cast', 'are', 'Hugo', 'Haas', 'womanizing', 'Prince', 'Nikolai', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'long', 'suffering', 'wise', 'wife', 'Princess', 'Tanya', 'scenes', 'together', 'Eddy', 'are', 'highlight', 'movie', 'Joseph', 'Schildkraut', 'Count', 'Igor', 'Savin', 'convincingly', 'evil', 'Natalia', 'scheming', 'blackmailing', 'husband.The', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'actually', 'had', 'great', 'possibilities', 'right', 'leads', 'shame', 'Nelson', 'Eddy', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'better', 'fare', 'last', 'movie', 'role', 'whenever', 'chance', 'hear', 'sing', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'reason', 'give', '4', 'stars']",N/A

263944,ARXLHOKV7FKU4,6301750756,Gina Rose St John,"[29, 30]","I gave this film 3 stars for Nelson Eddy who can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned. One wonders, though, what the producers had in mind because the minor characters have more scenes and close-ups than the stars. The setting is interesting, a Russian colony on Northern California's coast in the early 1800's and Eddy is the law, working for the Russian government. Eddy is rugged and good-looking and his voice is in fine form singing Friml's &quot;Nearer and Dearer&quot; and &quot;Love is the Time&quot;. At age 46,  the singer does his own stunts, defeats the bad guys, one a slimy aristocrat who theatens the beautiful Hungarian actress,Ilona Masssey who also sings, but is no match for Eddy's booming baritone. Elsa Lanchester is wry and delightful as a princess who wins back the love of her wayward husband and also unites the lovers. I especially liked the last scene where Eddy rides his horse with the exquite blond  beauty, Massey, on his lap. The kiss she gives him to get him to stop singing is just wonderful.  This was Eddy's last film. He quit Hollywood and concentrated on his concerts, operas, and nightclub act with Gale Sherwood. At age 67, he collapsed on stage and his wonderful voice was stilled forever.",3,"Nelson Eddy Rides, and Sings, Again!",1027123200,"07 20, 2002",2002,1229,"['gave', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'Nelson', 'Eddy', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'One', 'wonders', 'though', 'what', 'producers', 'had', 'mind', 'minor', 'characters', 'have', 'more', 'scenes', 'close-ups', 'stars', 'setting', 'interesting', 'Russian', 'colony', 'Northern', 'California', 'coast', 'early', '1800', 'Eddy', 'law', 'working', 'Russian', 'government', 'Eddy', 'rugged', 'good-looking', 'voice', 'fine', 'form', 'singing', 'Friml', 'quot', 'Nearer', 'Dearer', 'quot', 'quot', 'Love', 'Time', 'quot', 'age', '46', 'singer', 'own', 'stunts', 'bad', 'guys', 'one', 'slimy', 'aristocrat', 'who', 'beautiful', 'Hungarian', 'actress', 'Ilona', 'Masssey', 'who', 'also', 'sings', 'match', 'Eddy', 'booming', 'baritone', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'wry', 'delightful', 'princess', 'who', 'back', 'love', 'wayward', 'husband', 'also', 'lovers', 'especially', 'liked', 'last', 'scene', 'where', 'Eddy', 'horse', 'exquite', 'blond', 'beauty', 'Massey', 'lap', 'kiss', 'get', 'stop', 'singing', 'just', 'wonderful', 'was', 'Eddy', 'last', 'film', 'quit', 'Hollywood', 'concentrated', 'concerts', 'operas', 'nightclub', 'act', 'Gale', 'Sherwood', 'age', '67', 'collapsed', 'stage', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'was', 'stilled', 'forever']",N/A
