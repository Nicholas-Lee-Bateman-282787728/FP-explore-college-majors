Hanneman ""Dave H""","[1, 1]","Short - because it is only half of a season; but nice because this Season flips Eureka on it's head with multiple role changes following a time travel incident. I especially liked the crossover episode, where Douglas gets a visit from someone on Warehouse 13, another SyFy Channel show. Carter finally gets to kiss Allison, and in the rest of the show it looks like he is lucky & unlucky in love. (A love quadrangle develops?) Henry gets a new love interest, thanks to his alternate-universe self. And we get a new character to hate - Dr Trevor.I don't know whether to be happy or sad that releases are starting to come in half-seasons instead of full seasons. On the one hand, I can rewatch my favorite episodes without waiting as long; on the other hand, each set has fewer episodes. I am very satisfied with Amazon's pre-order policy - I think this was $25 or $30 when I pre-ordered it, but when it finally shipped, the price had dropped to $17.

But it forms the centerpiece of ""Eureka Season 4.0,"" in which a single jaunt back in time causes sweeping changes for the citizens of Eureka -- it sounds like a cheap way of shaking things up, but the focus on what time travel has changed is pretty interesting.Carter (Colin Ferguson) is out jogging on Founder's Day when he suddenly goes back in time to the year 1947, along with Allison (Salli Richardson-Whitfield), Jo (Erica Cerra), Henry (Joe Morton) and Fargo (Neil Grayston). With the assistance of scientist Trevor Grant (James Callis), and are able to get back to present-day Eureka.But... some things have changed. Jo is the security chief of Global Dynamics and never dated Zane, Kevin is not autistic, Andy the robot is Carter's new deputy, Henry is married to a woman he doesn't know, and Fargo is now the director of Global Dynamics. Oh yes, and Grant has come forward in time with them.As they try to adjust to this new timeline, they have to deal with mysterious power surges, a zombie-style rage infection, a super-oxygen infestation, random teleportation (from 1947!), stalkerish A.I.s, people turning into stone statues, and hallucinations of people from the past. And Dr. Grant starts discovering that the future isn't all it's cracked up to be.I was starting to lose faith in ""Eureka"" after the disappointing Season 3.5, which was basically a bunch of standalone episodes. And while ""time travel ripples"" sounds like a cheap way of shaking things up, it actually works quite well here -- the writers spend the entire season exploring the repercussions of time travel.It sounds kind of grim, but there are some fun moments keeping it light -- particularly a cute Wall-E-esque robot, or Carter throwing the despised Fargo a ravening horde. The one real disappointment is the Eureka crossover -- it's not really BAD, but Claudia Donovan's visit is kinda anticlimactic because... she doesn't do anything except ogle the machinery and make out with Fargo.Colin Ferguson continues to be charmingly down-to-earth, even as Carter gets enmeshed in a very tense love triangle with Grant and Allison. Also fun: the writers take some clever pokes at Carter's role in the show (""Hello, I'm Sheriff Carter! I'm going to save the day with my everyman logic! Ha ha ha!"").But all the characters get some solid development -- Jo is in turmoil over the loss of Zane, Allison becomes even more of a fierce mama bear now that her son is normal, and Henry starts falling in love with the wife he doesn't even know (although this happens a bit too fast). Oh, and Sheriff Andy is back as Deputy Andy, reciting bad poetry and suffering massive damage.""Eureka Season 4.0"" pumps some new life into this quirky sci-fi show, and rearranges some of the key players.

In the meantime, here's EUREKA SEASON 4.0 which I hope more people don't misconstrue as the full season collected (the ""Season 4.0"" tag - as opposed to just ""Season 4"" - is sort of a hint). Speaking for myself, these particular half-a-season releases are perfectly fine. I'm one of them gents what can't wait for the full season DVD to come out; it's too long a wait. And, like someone here already said, those assuming that this DVD set release contains the entire season's episodes when Syfy hasn't even aired all of them yet - well, give me a hit of what you're smoking. Otherwise, step off. EUREKA SEASON 4.0 is very reasonably priced, considering you do get nine episodes (ten, if you count the extended version of ""Founder's Day""), plus bonus features. This isn't one of those messed-up DVD sets which only present four measly episodes a pop.EUREKA's writing think tank got their clever on, thus circumventing the malaise that sometimes grips a show rolling on its third or fourth season. Season 4's opener, ""Founder's Day,"" shuffles the deck, flips the scenario, makes me gibber like a giddy aunt. ""Founder's Day"" is a marvelous time travel story. Thanks to a rash of solar flares, during the Founder's Day holiday, five of our main characters are catapulted back to the year 1947, when the hidden town of Eureka - back then more a rough military camp than an established town of geniuses - was first finding its legs. Our cast survives 1947 but then returns to an unfamiliar present-day Eureka. You have to give it up to the writers' reinventing of the show. It certainly hits that refresh button. Maybe the best bit is what happens to Fargo.Season 4 marks the return of several old favorites (treacherous psychologist Beverly Barlowe, the amiable Sheriff Andy, and Zoe Carter who shows up for several eps). Meanwhile, the tremendous James Callis (""Baltar"" to you) signs on as new cast member ""Dr. Old Spice"" (heh) and serves as a foil to Sheriff Jack Carter. And if you're one of them fools for romance and had been pulling for Sheriff Carter to get his love life together... well, practice those contented sighs. Conversely, Deputy Jo Lupo learns that, in this new reality, she and her boyfriend Zane had never gotten jiggy with it. I love Jo Lupo's personal arc in this season. Erica Cerra does that unrequited thing pretty well, balancing her no-nonsense toughness with an appealing emotional vulnerability.The cast hasn't eased off on being wonderful. There's still that air of unpredictability with each episode. As they say, in a secret community flaunting the world's most dangerous minds, anything can - and does - happen, from a calming ray reversing its purpose and turning the GD staff into homicidal zombies to intelligent AI exhibiting emotions to an outbreak of petrification. The playfulness is prevalent. And it just never gets old that Sheriff Carter always assumes this nonplussed expression whenever scientific exposition is going down (Colin Ferguson continues to be the bedrock of the show). The science run amok that frequently plagues Eureka is still based, however tenuously, on actual science or scientific theory. So maybe I'm soaking in knowledge whilst I'm watching one of my favorite shows.I'd normally mention which were my favorite episodes but they're all quite excellent. Maybe ""Founder's Day"" and ""A New World"" are a smidge above. ""Crossing Over"" is EUREKA's crossover ep with WAREHOUSE 13 and has the Warehouse's resident tech, Claudia Donovan, visiting Global Dynamics. I hope to heck that this crosspolination of Syfy shows continues and becomes tradition. That wouldn't suck at all. And ""Stoned,"" while a very good episode, is elevated by Joe Morton's surprise song rendition of a Thomas Dolby classic.But, okay, I am pretty bummed that episode 12, ""Reprise"" - which guest stars the awesomely awesome Felicia Day - won't be available until the Season 4.5 DVD set.Bonus material for the EUREKA: SEASON 4.0 set: Deleted Scenes for eight episodes (only ""Founder's Day - Extended Version"" and ""the Ex-Files"" don't have deleted scenes; the regular ""Founder's Day"" version does get a deleted scene); a gag reel; ""13.1,"" the WAREHOUSE 13 crossover episode; ""In the Beginning: Camp Eureka 1947"" - an inside look at the design of Camp Eureka 1947 (00:05:23 minutes long); and the ""Founder's Day"" Extended Version Filmmakers Commentary.",5,"""Hello, I'm Sheriff Carter.
