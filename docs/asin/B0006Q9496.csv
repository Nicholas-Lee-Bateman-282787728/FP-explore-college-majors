This particular complete series one contains eight episodes:""The British are Coming"" starts the series and explains many things that happen later in the series.""The Fallen Madonna"" with the big whatever. Will set a reoccurring theme as Colonel Kurk von Strom has pilfered the painting for his retirement. Keep you eye on it through the series as it becomes a shell game.------------Basic story is of a caf&eacute; owner Ren&eacute;; this is in France during the WWII occupation. He must balance dealing with the local Germans, the Gestapo, the good Resistance, the commie Resistance, having affairs with his female help, dealing with his wife and mother-in-law. Throw in some downed British airmen and some onion soup.I will not go though this series in detail because for those that have not seen it or if it has been while since viewing the series, the surprise factor and the one liners are worth discovering first hand.I will say that the highlight for me was when they mistakenly fed grain laced with nitro glycerin to the chickens.One nice thing about this series is that they place the name next to the actor at the end of each episode. Most of the actors are well known out side of this series. I was shocked however to find that Gestapo Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) Played British Capt. Newman in Ken Follett's ""The Key to Rebecca"" (1985) and completely changed his accent.I hope the will release the others ""Three Hail Mary's and two Heil Hitler's.""",5,Risque' Rene',1109030400,"02 22, 2005",2005,1572,"['Allo', 'Allo', 'been', '1982', 'just', 'recently', 'become', 'available', 'USA', 'decent', 'media', 'particular', 'complete', 'series', 'one', 'eight', 'episodes', 'British', 'are', 'Coming', 'series', 'many', 'things', 'happen', 'later', 'series', 'Fallen', 'Madonna', 'big', 'whatever', 'Will', 'set', 'reoccurring', 'theme', 'Colonel', 'Kurk', 'von', 'Strom', 'pilfered', 'painting', 'retirement', 'Keep', 'eye', 'series', 'shell', 'game.', 'Basic', 'story', 'caf', 'eacute', 'owner', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'France', 'WWII', 'occupation', 'must', 'balance', 'dealing', 'local', 'Germans', 'Gestapo', 'good', 'Resistance', 'commie', 'Resistance', 'having', 'affairs', 'female', 'help', 'dealing', 'wife', 'mother-in-law', 'Throw', 'downed', 'British', 'airmen', 'onion', 'soup.I', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'series', 'detail', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'been', 'viewing', 'series', 'surprise', 'factor', 'one', 'liners', 'are', 'worth', 'discovering', 'first', 'hand.I', 'will', 'say', 'highlight', 'was', 'when', 'mistakenly', 'fed', 'grain', 'laced', 'nitro', 'glycerin', 'chickens.One', 'nice', 'thing', 'series', 'place', 'name', 'next', 'actor', 'end', 'episode', 'Most', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'out', 'side', 'series', 'was', 'shocked', 'however', 'find', 'Gestapo', 'Herr', 'Otto', 'Flick', 'Richard', 'Gibson', 'Played', 'British', 'Capt', 'Newman', 'Ken', 'Follett', 'Key', 'Rebecca', '1985', 'completely', 'changed', 'accent.I', 'hope', 'will', 'release', 'others', 'Three', 'Hail', 'Mary', 'two', 'Heil', 'Hitler']",N/A
872325,A2BIK37ZMXKW91,B0006Q9496,"brian komyathy ""Thanks for scouting out my pa...","[5, 5]","These are the French (picture a cafe favored by the occupying Germans in a small french town) and over there in the dark, scheming to foil the Germans are the French resistance. The ONLY problem is that the resistance can't seem to accomplish anything without help, and that help is conveniently sought from the town's cafe owner. This character is a Lou Costello sort of fellow, but with considerably more intelligence; nevertheless, not enough to extricate himself out of the crazy schemes dreamt up by the French resistance leader. This is the plot of the show. Picture an ensemble Laurel and Hardy task-based sitcom werein the caricatured players are stealing/concealing/and playing hot potato with paintings to sell after the war; and are fashioning schemes (in a more adult manner, but reminiscent of the American classic rerun ""Gilligan's Island"") to return 2 airmen that were forced to bail out of their plane and dropped into this town, back to England.  The series is known for it's tag lines; think of The Honeymooners ""Bang Zoom""/""I've got a BIG mouth""/etc, ""Yes Minister""(from that eponymously named Britcom), & ""I know nothing"" (from Hogan's Heroes, a show which is more similar to 'Allo 'Allo than not), and multiply by 10. In addition, it's full of innuendo and farcical sterotypes, but remains unoffensive and amusing...as well as being addictively likable. Do give this Britcom a try if any of the above makes sense and seems at all appealing to you. I hope I have given you a feel whether this may be so or not in your individual case.

872326,A3VMJ4ZNZ20RGG,B0006Q9496,J. Dorman,"[17, 19]","I LOVE this show but my low rating is not due to the content of the set. Instead this is a question of math. I was purchasing the Series 1 set and saw the usual calculation and marketing tool that amazon uses in which they show you the cost if you bought Series 1 and Series 2. Well it seems the price is $55.98 for the two sets, not too bad especially for this great show. Well then I see that they are also selling the ""Complete Series One & Two Pack"" which is the same thing but instead this one has a cost of 62.99! Buying the set this way doesn't seem to add anything to the package but a higher price. So if you want to purchase both make sure you just add the seasons to your cart seperatly and skip the ""convenience"" of an almost $7 hike.UPDATE June 2006: It seems that Amazon has finaly adjusted the price to be in line with the single season packages!!! Hey, Amazon is a big store I figured they get with it sooner or later.UPDATE August 2006: Scratch the June update it seems the price is back to its $62.99 price. Idiots!!!UPDATE October 2007: Ok the lesson learned here is that I have watched the price of this box set fluctuate from around $70.00 to $50.00 YOU MUST PAY ATTENTION to the price I don't know why they would be doing this on a somewhat regular basis but I have talked with several people who have been stung by this box set. Watch the prices of these kinds of box sets, PLEASE!

From the very first episode to the last, all the characters are consistent and hilarious.  The plots are clever and each builds on previous episodes. Not a single word is wasted;  each is carefully chosen to add something to the story.I won't give away the story lines, so I'll just tell you it is set in France during WWII.  The main character is Rene, played by Gordon Kaye, who owns a cafe, and occupies his days trying to balance getting along with the Germans, the French Resistence, the Communist Resistence, his wife, who thinks she can sing, his mother-in-law, British airmen, various onion-sellers, the Gestapo, and the two lovely waitresses with whom he is having affairs.In some ways it's like the British series, ""Are You Being Served.""

This comedy has just the right characters playing the various parts and is so well done; very original.  Only an Englishman could think this stuff up.
