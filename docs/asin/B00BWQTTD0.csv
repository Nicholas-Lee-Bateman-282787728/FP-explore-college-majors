1640517,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00BWQTTD0,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[5, 10]","""Daktari: The Complete Second Season""  is a seven-disc DVD set containing 30 episodes of the second season of this adventure series.  Filmed at Africa, U.S.A., a wild-animal park near Los Angeles, ""Daktari"" tells the story of an American doctor and his daughter in Africa (""Daktari"" is the Swahili word for doctor).Marsh Tracy (Marshall Thompson) is a veterinarian who runs an animal study center with the assistance of his daughter Paula (Cheryl Miller) and a native named Mike (Hari Rhodes).  Jenny Jones (Erin Moran) appeared in the second season as a seven-year-old orphan who joins the Tracy household, which also includes a lion named Clarence and a chimpanzee named Judy.The Tracys' primary job is protecting animals from poachers and local officials.  Producer Ivan Tors began his career writing and producing sci-fi films before turning to TV with such shows as ""Science Fiction Theater,"" ""Sea Hunt,"" and ""The Aquanauts.""This mid-1960's show is clearly geared for families.  There is little violence, good messages about animal conservation, and simple-to-follow plots with pleasant resolutions.  Clarence was a star in his own right in the feature film, ""Clarence, the Cross-Eyed Lion"" (1965).There are no bonus features on this release.",3,Scene-stealing animals are the main attraction,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,1247,"['Daktari', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'seven-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'containing', '30', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'adventure', 'series', 'Filmed', 'Africa', 'U.S.A.', 'wild-animal', 'park', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Daktari', 'story', 'American', 'doctor', 'daughter', 'Africa', 'Daktari', 'Swahili', 'word', 'doctor', '.Marsh', 'Tracy', 'Marshall', 'Thompson', 'veterinarian', 'who', 'animal', 'study', 'center', 'assistance', 'daughter', 'Paula', 'Cheryl', 'Miller', 'native', 'named', 'Mike', 'Hari', 'Rhodes', 'Jenny', 'Jones', 'Erin', 'Moran', 'appeared', 'second', 'season', 'seven-year-old', 'orphan', 'who', 'Tracy', 'household', 'also', 'lion', 'named', 'Clarence', 'chimpanzee', 'named', 'Judy.The', 'Tracys', 'primary', 'job', 'protecting', 'animals', 'poachers', 'local', 'officials', 'Producer', 'Ivan', 'Tors', 'began', 'career', 'writing', 'producing', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'turning', 'TV', 'such', 'shows', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'Theater', 'Sea', 'Hunt', 'Aquanauts', 'mid-1960', 'show', 'clearly', 'geared', 'families', 'little', 'violence', 'good', 'messages', 'animal', 'conservation', 'simple-to-follow', 'plots', 'pleasant', 'resolutions', 'Clarence', 'was', 'star', 'own', 'right', 'feature', 'film', 'Clarence', 'Cross-Eyed', 'Lion', '1965', 'are', 'bonus', 'release']",Daktari: The Complete Second Season
