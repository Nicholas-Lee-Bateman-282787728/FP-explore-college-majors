The only way to get across how stupid it is is to describe the plot of this cheap Canadian production.Two yuppies move into a totally run-down house and three of their friends move in to help do repairs. They discover such mysterious things as a rat infestation, a large spider, weak floorboards and plumbing problems, but manage to fight back with their tool kits and knowledge of home repair. Meanwhile, the wife (who considers herself psychic) decides that ""house needs repairs"" = ""house is infested by evil"" and spazzes out over it all, although when she first saw the house she had a ""psychic"" feeling that they should buy it. Things get even more mysterious when they discover an old Catholic church confesssional stored in the basement (why in God's name is it there!!) and when a neighbourhood dog barks at them (how supernatural!!). Oh yeah, there's also an old woman with one eye hanging around agreeing with the wife that the house is ""evil"", and some guy who occassionally stands around on their front lawn and doesn't do anything but stare blankly at the house.Finally, during the last ten minutes of the film, all but two of the above characters get killed (off screen!) because coincidentally it turns out that one of the people staying in the house shot a priest to death in the very same confessional now stored in the basement and suppressed the memory, so this person goes psycho after seeing the confessional. There is, however, one survivor who easily beats up the killer, although most of the other victims were much stronger physically and should have been able to defend themselves just as well.This Old House is far more exciting.",1,The Horror!

Sure it isn't THE AMITYVILLE HORROR or AMITYVILLE II: THE POSSESSION, but this one is a worthy sequel.An unseen assailant murders a Priest in his confessional, forcing the Church to close. Years later, a married couple named DEBBIE (played by Dawna Wightman) and FRANK (played by Kim Coates) buy the beautiful colonial house on 112 Ocean Ave. Debbie finds herself feeling strangely drawn to the house because she has seen it in her dreams. After moving into the house, Debbie's dreams become more intense, which strengthen the evil within the house, where all the nightmarish hauntings REALLY begin. First, the Priest's former housekeeper is murdered by an unseen force, other hauntings go on, where Debbie must battle the evil and save herself, her husband, hopefully put an end to Amityville's evil.Again, this was a worthy sequel.

It's incoherent, elongated, doesn't make any sense and fails to capture the viewer's attention.  There's very little to like about this movie.  I have no earthly idea what this movie has to do with the rest of the series.  Basically, someone kills a priest during a confession, and the confessional compartment is somehow located in this strange house that some people move into.  This movie is essentially much ado about nothing as nothing of any consequence takes place for very long periods during the movie.  The movies simply never gets off the ground and nothing is established so there's ultimately nothing to build on.

261312,A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY,6301664116,MacheteJason,"[0, 0]","This direct to video movie is so bad it never received a US DVD or Blu-ray release! It got stuck on VHS. Even House of the Dead got a DVD and a Blu-ray! The film was loosely based around Hans Holzer's book The Amityville Curse. It has an (obviously) different house than the original Amityville (112 Ocean Avenue) and isn't really connected to the other films in the franchise (there is a brief reference to the DeFeo murders and to the town's supernatural history). It doesn't have a supernatural theme and seems more like a crime-drama than horror. Moving the ""villain"" and changing the formula is often a bad idea in this genre. In a weird way I would almost compare it to Halloween 3 or F13 5: A New Beginning. This is the last feature of the Amityville-like house before artifacts get scattered around the United States in later sequels (until the remake). Oddly, that theme seemed to survive much better than any ideas introduced in Amityville: Curse. If this has something to do with Amityville Horror it must have Exorcist III as an influence in its plot structure by turning a minor character into a leading role.Curse has a similar rating to Living Dead: Resurrection and Texas Chainsaw: Next Generation (ouch!). Critics did not mind Amityville 5 too much but never liked this franchise anyway (Roger Ebert famously bashed it). I didn't agree with Ebert on much but this sequel is worth skipping. I have watched it a few times but it seems like shoestring to me. If you want a great Canadian horror film then check out Videodrome, Cube or My Bloody Valentine instead. To add insult to injury, the other Amityville Horror sequels after this one got DVD releases. $45 for this? Forget about it. It rates a jaw-dropping 2 stars on Amazon. The 1990s didn't exactly start with a bang here. It got a little better but I have no idea what happened to the scripts for Hellraiser, Amityville Horror and The Howling franchises (Hellraiser being the best of the late 80s/early 90s). In all fairness the first two Amityville movies were head and shoulders above the rest. Amityville 3D will always be remembered for its ""special effects"", makeup and costumes.
