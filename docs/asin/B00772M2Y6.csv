It's all there and more.  The only DVD I had of the Dead was the Grateful Dead movie, so buying this set was a no-brainer.  And boy am I glad I did!  I just watched a couple shows I was at in Pittsburgh and Louisville back in 1990 and the video is stellar and the sound is wonderful.  It brought back so many great memories of those shows, touring around with the dead in the late 80's & 90's, as well as pointing out some songs/moments that I didn't remember at all!  ;-)  I turned it up, started dancing, and was immersed again in another LIVE dead show...  with Jerry's beautiful, loving grin on full display, along with his incredible and unique guitar playing I've been missing.  I've only watched one of the DVD's so far and it's already worth the $100 dollars I spent.  Can't wait to see all the other shows now!  There is concert footage in the collection that is not officially listed.  What a great DVD collection for all Dead Heads to enjoy for the rest of their lives.  Phenomenal.

It is unfortunate that the So Far DVD just seems to have been copied from the VHS so it is actually not as crisp as the original VHS release.

This DVD box will forever remind me of the good old days when these guys could make me follow them all over the place from 1982 until the end. The only complaint I have is this.

1527179,A2G7HV826ENWKD,B00772M2Y6,Stephen Bieth,"[63, 67]","This is the most amazing box set to come out on DVD in the history of music! I know how that sounds but I can not believe what you get for the Price. Except for two of the Discs I already owned everything else in the box and I still think it's great. P,us at this price if i had bought the two discs on their own it would come to almost the same amount. For those of you who were ticked off that very little of this box set was still avalible on their own you get it all at a greatly reduced price. I paid almost $40 for the Winterland DVD and close to $50 for the DVD of the Grateful Dead movie. Even the vault series discs were expensive when they came out. This is what you get:The Grateful Dead movie which was originally released in theaters. This was shot on film so it looks great. The audio improvements are nothing short of incredible.Closing Of Winterland which was originally a TV broadcast. Again amazing sound. Nice mix. Three sets of music plus the Blues Brothers to boot.Dead Ahead while not my favorite of their DVD's it does have a great acoustic set at the beginning. It's also shot at Radio City in New YorkSo Far: this is the first time this has been out on DVD. I have had the video for years. Good set list. Songs are done part live in studio and the all of a sudden it's live in front of an audience. You have to watch to see what I am talking about. It's like a visual of a lot of live albums. Where they splice different sections of the same song from different performances to try and make a stronger track. That's what they have done here but they are not hiding it.Ticket To New Years: Television broadcast of a new years eve show in Oakland. Great set but a little shorter then their other shows. But I would assume that was due to it being shown on TV. Couple of funny skits they made to run on TV between sets.Truckin Up To Buffalo: great 4th of July show in Buffalo. Really good set list and really nice 5.1 mixDownhill From Here: Seriously how many band would do this? The title came from the fact that the Dead thought of this as the last of their great shows as a band and after 89 they had good shows but not like their last peek period. Most Band's would never even admit that let alone name a DVD release about it. The dead would still be touring for another five years.View From Rhe Vault volumes 1 through 4: 4 separate releases in the same series. These were films taken from the video screens during the Dead stadium years. All but one are stereo only. However they did pick some great shows. This is as close as you will get to the look and feel of a Dead show in the late 80's / early 90'sBonus Disc: some unreleased performances and a documentary that runs about two hours.Book containing liner notes and pictures.This is a Dead Heads dream. Time to alter the perception and sit back and groove. This is like a trip through time. Have to leave you with the Dead's most famous line ""Lately it accured to me.
