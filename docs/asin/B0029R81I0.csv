Only covers 8 areas of our vast Park system but what is here is interesting.  There's a lot better out there to choose from.,3,Nat'l Parks 101,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,202,"['Good', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'lot', 'detail', 'dated', 'very', 'limited', 'scope', 'Only', '8', 'areas', 'vast', 'Park', 'system', 'what', 'here', 'interesting', 'lot', 'better', 'there', 'choose']",National Parks Collection

This is a fantastic set. Very interesting and great video quality. The nay sayers must have a grudge against National Geographic? One person said in there review that in the DEATH VALLEY episode they mention GLOBAL WARMING 12 times. That is a flat out LIE! I watched that episode last night. The only time GLOBAL WARMING is mentioned is 1 time at the very end. They mention CLIMATE CHANGE several times. They mention it is UNCERTAIN what is causing CLIMATE CHANGE. I don't believe in GLOBAL WARMING. But, i have no problem with it being mentioned 1 time as long as they also mentioned CLIMATE CHANGE AND IT IS UNCERTAIN what is causing it. Only a FOOL would deny natural climate change not caused by man. But, i think it is important that all sides of an argument be heard. After all, free thought is OK as long as they are honest with the facts. This is a fantastic set to compliment the KEN BURNS NATIONAL PARKS sets i own. The film footage in this set is AWESOME. So what if you don't agree with every single statement. If you are that narrow minded maybe you should move into a cave.",5,Great stuff!,1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,1199,"['held', 'off', 'buying', 'few', 'months', 'negative', 'reviews', 'finally', 'boought', '10', 'dvd', 'set', 'fantastic', 'set', 'Very', 'interesting', 'great', 'video', 'quality', 'nay', 'sayers', 'must', 'have', 'grudge', 'National', 'Geographic', 'One', 'person', 'said', 'review', 'DEATH', 'VALLEY', 'episode', 'mention', 'GLOBAL', 'WARMING', '12', 'times', 'flat', 'out', 'LIE', 'watched', 'episode', 'last', 'night', 'only', 'time', 'GLOBAL', 'WARMING', 'mentioned', '1', 'time', 'very', 'end', 'mention', 'CLIMATE', 'CHANGE', 'several', 'times', 'mention', 'UNCERTAIN', 'what', 'causing', 'CLIMATE', 'CHANGE', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'GLOBAL', 'WARMING', 'i', 'have', 'problem', 'being', 'mentioned', '1', 'time', 'as', 'long', 'also', 'mentioned', 'CLIMATE', 'CHANGE', 'AND', 'IT', 'IS', 'UNCERTAIN', 'what', 'causing', 'Only', 'FOOL', 'would', 'deny', 'natural', 'climate', 'change', 'not', 'caused', 'man', 'i', 'think', 'important', 'sides', 'argument', 'be', 'heard', 'free', 'thought', 'OK', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'honest', 'facts', 'fantastic', 'set', 'compliment', 'KEN', 'BURNS', 'NATIONAL', 'PARKS', 'i', 'own', 'film', 'footage', 'set', 'AWESOME', 'So', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'single', 'statement', 'are', 'narrow', 'minded', 'maybe', 'should', 'move', 'cave']",National Parks Collection
1257118,A6TBR6L2D4XKC,B0029R81I0,Marvin R. Doering,"[8, 11]",I was hoping for a travelogue showing the beautiful parks.  Instead I felt like I was attending a college lecture put on by an environmental engineer.  The parks were simply backgrounds for various scientists and nature freaks to express their concern that all the parks will be destroyed by people.  Much preferred the Ken Burns documentary.,3,"Looking for beautiful photography, not so much.",1313539200,"08 17, 2011",2011,342,"['was', 'hoping', 'travelogue', 'showing', 'beautiful', 'parks', 'Instead', 'felt', 'was', 'attending', 'college', 'lecture', 'put', 'environmental', 'engineer', 'parks', 'were', 'simply', 'backgrounds', 'various', 'scientists', 'nature', 'freaks', 'express', 'concern', 'parks', 'will', 'be', 'destroyed', 'people', 'Much', 'preferred', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'documentary']",National Parks Collection
1257119,A24VHTPNY9PTFE,B0029R81I0,Mr. Einstein,"[20, 21]","As a previous reviewer of this DVD set noted, these five ""National Parks"" programs were produced for television. As such, they're skewed toward sensationalism and lots of ""gloom-and-doom."" It's the gloom-and-doom that's tedious to watch, albeit there is some truth in it. Actually, the rock climber's three-day ascent of El Capitan on the Yosemite disc is quite impressive. The Yellowstone and Death Valley discs have their moments, whilst the Everglades and Hawaii programs put me to sleep. I've watched a half dozen DVD productions on America's national parks (including Ken Burns). The two best in my opinion are ""Treasures of America's National Parks"" (Questar Entertainment), and ""Great Lodges of the National Parks"" ([...]).",2,Don't Expect Much,1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,730,"['previous', 'reviewer', 'DVD', 'set', 'noted', 'five', 'National', 'Parks', 'programs', 'were', 'produced', 'television', 'such', ""'re"", 'skewed', 'sensationalism', 'lots', 'gloom-and-doom', 'gloom-and-doom', 'tedious', 'watch', 'truth', 'Actually', 'rock', 'climber', 'three-day', 'ascent', 'El', 'Capitan', 'Yosemite', 'disc', 'quite', 'impressive', 'Yellowstone', 'Death', 'Valley', 'discs', 'have', 'moments', 'whilst', 'Everglades', 'Hawaii', 'programs', 'put', 'sleep', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'half', 'dozen', 'DVD', 'productions', 'America', 'national', 'parks', 'including', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'two', 'best', 'opinion', 'are', 'Treasures', 'America', 'National', 'Parks', 'Questar', 'Entertainment', 'Great', 'Lodges', 'National', 'Parks', '[', ']']",National Parks Collection
