The Japanese Wife may seem as an oddball film for many viewers will equally satisfy many of them.Snehamoy (Rahul Bose) is a shy math teacher in a small rural town who takes up writing to an equally shy pen pal Miyage (Chigusa Takaku) in Japan.  Little do they know that their relationship would soon blossom and they would become husband and wife. Poverty and circumstances prevent them for meeting each other for 15 years but their communication is frequent and love stronger than ever. A young widow Raima Sen ends up taking refuge at Snehamoy's house at the insistence of his aunt played by Moshmi Chatterjee and she is quietly attracted to him. Snehamoy remains fully committed to his Japanese wife. The movie ending was one of the most ironic and heartbreaking that I have seen in recent times.Rahul Bose was great as the shy teacher. Moushmi Chatterjee makes a welcome return and Raima Sen and Chigusa Takaku both manage to play their difficult roles with ease. The photography was great and the Sunderbans look beautiful, it is hard to imagine that such pristine places still exist in India. The only grouse that I had was the poor film transfer to DVD, it seems that one is watching an old VHS tape and could be the reason for many people hating the movie. I enjoyed the film.

1353929,A140XH16IKR4B0,B003M5P9GK,Jean E. Pouliot,"[1, 1]","Don't be fooled by the lighthearted start of ""The Japanese Wife""! Its protagonists - a shy, bumbling Bengali math teacher and a reclusive young Japanese woman - appear weightless and even silly. But each hides a desperate desire to be loved that transcends distance and the smirks of friends. Part of me wants movies to be all one thing or another - either comedy of drama. I can even appreciate dramas that contain dark humor. But this film has a hinge that swings it from comic shallowness to affecting depth. The second half of the film takes the flighty youths of the first half, and faces them with desperation, temptation and death.

So why did I rate this movie the highest 5 stars? It is a movie that tells an unusual story, not exactly a love story but more of a tale of communication between a man and two women...communication despite poverty induced lack of technical gizmos and cross cultures...across continents and oceans. It is a tale of how shy and lonely people can somehow have a normal relationship in a very un-normal way. She is the typical loyal Japanese wife and he finds himself tempted by a flesh and blood woman that is living right in his own home. The ""other"" woman was supposed to marry him and feels she has to remain loyal to the man she did marry and who is now dead--even though she also finds herself tempted. It is heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time...and in the end manages to make the viewer cry--and smile.

1353932,AQ2UN38CMK119,B003M5P9GK,P. Mann,"[6, 6]","Let's just get this out of the way right off the bat. This film deserved much better than it received in this release. The film is in (broken) English, Bengali, and Japanese. As such, subtitles are necessary for all but the extreme polyglot. And there are indeed subtitles, but they are not removable, and they are often extremely hard to read as they blend into the images too often. I had the sense that I was missing significant portions of the movie.Fortunately, though, the story is fairly simple, a combination of84 Charing Cross RoadandMarty (1954). A young Indian man begins a pen-pal correspondence with a young Japanese woman. They write in English, the only language they have in common, and their relationship soon grows into something rather powerful. Indeed, after a few years, she suggests they marry, which they do. Sort of. They still have not met at this time and are not able to afford to do so in order to get married, so each simply honors the marriage in his or her heart. This matter is facilitated by the fact that both characters are extremely shy and seem to find courage, freedom, and, indeed, love in their writing--which is odd in that neither is especially proficient at English.Most of the movie is set in India, and the flavor of the film is one of its charms. The setting is as much a character as any of the humans, and it is used to good effect. But the heart of the film is ultimately very human, and it includes a love story as potent as any in my recent memory.",5,Wonderful film but with poor subtitles,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,1499,"['Let', 'just', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'film', 'deserved', 'much', 'better', 'received', 'release', 'film', 'broken', 'English', 'Bengali', 'Japanese', 'such', 'subtitles', 'are', 'necessary', 'extreme', 'polyglot', 'are', 'indeed', 'subtitles', 'are', 'not', 'removable', 'are', 'often', 'extremely', 'hard', 'read', 'blend', 'images', 'too', 'often', 'had', 'sense', 'was', 'missing', 'significant', 'portions', 'movie.Fortunately', 'story', 'fairly', 'simple', 'combination', 'Charing', 'Cross', 'RoadandMarty', '1954', 'young', 'Indian', 'man', 'pen-pal', 'correspondence', 'young', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'write', 'English', 'only', 'language', 'have', 'common', 'relationship', 'soon', 'something', 'rather', 'powerful', 'Indeed', 'few', 'years', 'marry', 'do', 'Sort', 'still', 'have', 'not', 'met', 'time', 'are', 'not', 'able', 'afford', 'do', 'so', 'order', 'get', 'married', 'so', 'simply', 'marriage', 'heart', 'matter', 'facilitated', 'fact', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'shy', 'seem', 'find', 'courage', 'freedom', 'indeed', 'love', 'writing', 'odd', 'especially', 'proficient', 'English.Most', 'movie', 'set', 'India', 'flavor', 'film', 'one', 'charms', 'setting', 'as', 'much', 'character', 'humans', 'used', 'good', 'effect', 'heart', 'film', 'ultimately', 'very', 'human', 'love', 'story', 'as', 'potent', 'recent', 'memory']",N/A
