Wood ""Content Writer and Reviewer""","[4, 7]","An author, after coming back from a sabbatical, invites six of his friends (three men, three women) to his island paradise. The only way on and off the island is by boat. During dinner he tells them of his intimate travels to Africa and Peru.He went on sabbatical because he had recently lost the love of his life and had become thoroughly depressed. He wore his depression on his face but would not share it. In an effort to release his pain a shaman he meets on a mountain top poisons him to help him release his pain. In his mind he died up on that mountain and was reborn.When his guests start to become shaky and nauseous they realize their host has poisoned them as well. This does not have the desired effect he expected, especially after one of them drops to the ground a few minutes later with no pulse. Hysterical anger ensues.I really enjoyed the movie and came upon it immediately from a comedic perspective rather than a psychological horror one. I also knew it would be a B-movie. Lance Henrikson played the lead character (although you don't see him for the first 10-15 minutes) and had me in stitches with his quirky looks of disbelief and knowing smiles.Some of the supportive actors were a bit stereotypical and over the top. In the beginning Lance had said their secrets affected everyone else at the table but I didn't see a complete weave with everyone. Some scenes were definitely better than other ones and it was predictable. If you can catch it on tv, rent it or find it in the discount bin go for it.

779101,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0000DJYMP,Michael Butts,"[2, 6]","THE INVITATION's premise is fairly simple:  Lance Henriksen stars as a man who invites eight of his friends to his remote island getaway.  In the spirit of TEN LITTLE INDIANS with somewhat of a twist, he informs them that he has been &quot;born again&quot; and also, by the way, he's poisoned each of them.  He will give them the antidote if they all confess to some hideous secret they all share that involves each other.  The script is so shoddily written, however, that it takes a long time to fully understand just what it is each of these people have done.  Also asks the question, who died and made Lance Henriksen God?  He says he's doing it for their own good, to allow them &quot;freedom in their lives&quot;.  His method of freeing them however is ultimately cruel and sadistic; also the ending is predictable and the little dog is the clue to the esoteric climax.An unusual premise given shoddy treatment.  Henriksen does fairly well, but the rest of the cast is only average at best.

When Lance Henriksen is the star and there are no other recognizable names or faces, maybe that is a cue that you might want to see something else.  As a mystery, it does not work because what is going on becomes painfully clear pretty early in the movie.  I do not feel that it is fair to blame the actors, who incidentally do not distinguish themselves.  But, who could make something out of this simplistic yet muddled mess?  It would have been somewhat interesting if we could make some sense of each character's epiphanies, but they are so garbled and unclear that there is never any payoff.  And, on top of that, the ending (I shall not give it away) was contrived and trite.

779104,A1A1PFR2ZH6DPV,B0000DJYMP,PlumedSerpent,"[1, 2]","This movie started out with an intriguing concept: ""Fantasy Island""-type host Roland invites 6 friends to dinner, and then reveals he has poisoned them all, ""for their own good"" - because they will have to unburden themselves from the big lie upon which their lives are based, before he will give them the antidote.  He is giving them the chance to be ""born again,"" just as he was, when he had a similar experience in Peru.  He claims each person's secret is intertwined with everyone else's, as well as with his own life.  And here's where the premise falters.  For most of the guests, it's never entirely clear what their ""secret"" is, and even less clear how it ties in to everyone else's.  Yes, there are hints of interconnections, but it could have been crafted much more expertly.  I can't help but wonder if a great deal of this movie remained on the editing room floor - or was it really written this badly?  It could have been great; as it was, it was merely okay, and somewhat disappointing, although it did have a satisfactory conclusion.  Ironically the biggest ""secret"" of all ended up being Roland's, which was a nice twist.
