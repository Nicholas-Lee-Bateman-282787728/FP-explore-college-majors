This one was a lot of stretching and muscle toning and the lower body work was a bit challenging.  My muscles are sore today and I worked out almost every day before pregnancy.  I wish that it would move at a faster pace, though...Unlike other videos, the host is not annoying at all and I like her accent.",4,Good workout.

A true pleasure to workout with and love her accent! I have used this DVD for both pregnancies and I swear this is what helped me recover so quickly!The first section is for your core and [...] with mainly Pilates and some Yoga exercises. The second section is lower body which helped me build strength and keep me strong for my delivery. The Third section was upper body with light weights and the last section which I really loved and so did my husband was the partner stretching. The stretches helped my lower back issues. I am near the end of my second Pregnancy and still have the energy to keep doing the video a few times a week.

The ""3-in-1"" refers to the combination of Yoga to calm the body and spirit, Pilates to promote flexibility and improve posture, and weight exercises to maintain and improve one's physique. Designed as much to prepare a woman who is expecting pregnancy as it is to help one remain in optimal physical condition throughout 9 months and reclaim one's figure after childbirth, Pregnancy System 3 in 1 applies tested exercises to the upper body, core, and lower body in a routine beneficial to one's whole self. Hosted by international star Tracey Mallett, who applied her years of Pilates and fitness expertise to refining the system, Pregnancy System 3 in 1 is enthusiastically recommended for any pregnant or soon-to-be pregnant woman. 60 minutes, color.",5,Recommended for any pregnant or soon-to-be pregnant woman,1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,856,"['Tracey', 'Mallett', 'Fitness', 'Pregnancy', 'System', '3', '1', 'fitness', 'DVD', 'designed', 'especially', 'pregnant', 'women', '3-in-1', 'refers', 'combination', 'Yoga', 'calm', 'body', 'spirit', 'promote', 'flexibility', 'improve', 'posture', 'weight', 'exercises', 'maintain', 'improve', 'one', 'physique', 'Designed', 'much', 'prepare', 'woman', 'who', 'expecting', 'pregnancy', 'help', 'one', 'remain', 'optimal', 'physical', 'condition', '9', 'months', 'reclaim', 'one', 'figure', 'childbirth', 'Pregnancy', 'System', '3', '1', 'applies', 'tested', 'exercises', 'upper', 'body', 'core', 'lower', 'body', 'routine', 'beneficial', 'one', 'whole', 'self', 'Hosted', 'international', 'star', 'Tracey', 'Mallett', 'who', 'applied', 'years', 'Pilates', 'fitness', 'expertise', 'refining', 'system', 'Pregnancy', 'System', '3', '1', 'enthusiastically', 'recommended', 'pregnant', 'soon-to-be', 'pregnant', 'woman', '60', 'minutes', 'color']",N/A
929004,A2HOI4JAQDNPS,B000AMKVYS,Mother Brown,"[1, 1]","This isn't really a workout.  It's like a series of very easy warm-up exercises.  Very slow.  The reason I gave it two stars rather than one is that my 5 year old likes doing the partner exercise routine with me, and it's the only pregnancy dvd she'll consent to do with me; and it's arguably better than nothing.  But it really doesn't get you worked out.  (Also, I personally hate the partner routine; the husband is so smarmy!  But that's a side issue).  This will work for you if you hardly move at all, and need some stretches.
