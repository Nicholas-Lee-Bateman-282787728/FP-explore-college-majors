I got this set for a friend, as a Christmas gift. He mentioned he watches some episodes on YouTube, and i thought he would deal better with having the physical DVDs rather then streaming it online. I am a fan of the show and found the price of all eleven seasons in one box set to be unbeatable. Each individual season usually sells for the same price of this entire box set, so there is no need to even do the math. Unfortunately, I got each box set as they were individually released. Anyways, i thought it would be a nice gesture to give him this box set as a Christmas gift. I think he was truly touched and i think someone like him can really appreciate this show for what it is and the sentiment behind the gift. Most people want expensive and lavish gifts. I think this will do just fine. I just love giving the gift of entertainment.On another note, this show really defined a generation. The cast is amazing, their one-liners and quick witted comebacks are a blast to enjoy no matter what decade one is in. This is a true classic not to be missed. Every family has a bit of dysfunction, but the Bundy's really exemplified their thoughts and let them be personified out LOUD. I do have to admit that since i am a HUGE fan of the show that I personally noticed that season seven is where the `magic' really disappears. Each episode dealt less with fun family issues like excessive phone bills, paying taxes, dealing with a leak in the ceiling, anniversary gifts, or Peggy running to Vegas after selling Al's TV. The family issues in the latter seasons were lacking and i think that contributed to its loss of magic. However, I'd still recommend this show and urge one to pick it up for good, fond memories, or a slice of the eighties.",5,Great Series at a Great Price,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,1840,"['classic', 'never', 'dies', 'surely', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'use', 'show', 'case', 'point', 'got', 'set', 'friend', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'mentioned', 'episodes', 'YouTube', 'i', 'thought', 'would', 'deal', 'better', 'having', 'physical', 'DVDs', 'rather', 'then', 'streaming', 'online', 'am', 'fan', 'show', 'found', 'price', 'eleven', 'seasons', 'one', 'box', 'set', 'be', 'unbeatable', 'individual', 'season', 'usually', 'same', 'price', 'entire', 'box', 'set', 'need', 'even', 'do', 'math', 'Unfortunately', 'got', 'box', 'set', 'were', 'individually', 'released', 'Anyways', 'i', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'gesture', 'give', 'box', 'set', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'think', 'was', 'truly', 'touched', 'i', 'think', 'someone', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', 'show', 'what', 'sentiment', 'gift', 'Most', 'people', 'want', 'expensive', 'lavish', 'gifts', 'think', 'will', 'do', 'just', 'fine', 'just', 'love', 'giving', 'gift', 'entertainment.On', 'note', 'show', 'really', 'defined', 'generation', 'cast', 'amazing', 'one-liners', 'quick', 'witted', 'comebacks', 'are', 'blast', 'enjoy', 'matter', 'what', 'decade', 'one', 'true', 'classic', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'family', 'bit', 'dysfunction', 'Bundy', 'really', 'exemplified', 'thoughts', 'let', 'be', 'personified', 'out', 'LOUD', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'i', 'am', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'show', 'personally', 'noticed', 'season', 'seven', 'where', 'magic', 'really', 'episode', 'less', 'fun', 'family', 'issues', 'excessive', 'phone', 'bills', 'paying', 'taxes', 'dealing', 'leak', 'ceiling', 'anniversary', 'gifts', 'Peggy', 'running', 'Vegas', 'selling', 'Al', 'TV', 'family', 'issues', 'latter', 'seasons', 'were', 'lacking', 'i', 'think', 'contributed', 'loss', 'magic', 'However', ""'d"", 'still', 'recommend', 'show', 'urge', 'one', 'pick', 'up', 'good', 'fond', 'memories', 'slice', 'eighties']",Married... with Children: The Complete Series

1383862,A2OTT4J4JLCL1G,B00432QAKK,"C. Gregory ""C. Gregory""","[1, 1]","but I love the show and well the pricing makes the packaging bearable. The box comes with two plastic spindles which hold the dvds, so six seasons share one season and five the other spindle. while this is a great space saver. I do not understand why the spindles are so cheap why not make the tray/spindle a hard plastic? and the slip cover is ok, but not as sturdy as it should be.now onto the show itself. I lost track of the series during the last few seasons. I did not realize it was on for 11 seasons. and even though fox was screwing around with the schedule I had seen more of these episodes than I thought I did. But watching them straight through and seeing the evolution of the characters worked out great. there are a few featurettes that have interviews with the cast as well as easter eggs that have additional unaired clips from a reunion special. and there is an episode from the third season that wasn't aired (or so it says, but I swear I've seen it before...and in hindsight I wonder why it wasn't shown originally as they had done far more controversial episodes throughout their run.One thing I did notice (which is the beauty of watching a show season by season...as you can see things you missed when they first aired) is that the show never really jumped the shark, as it pretty much was an over the top production to begin with. the show seemed to relish in its absurdities. There were times when a character fell off the roof and it was obvious it was a dummy, and someone would say, ok we can see that's not a real person, well those people didn't get the joke. the writers invited us into their twisted little world. and they let us in on the jokes, so in some ways the show was a satire of all other family based sitcoms, and on the other hand it was a very unique take on the family sitcom.  The cast was perfect, the writing was spot-on and no matter how absurd it got, you couldn't help but laugh. It never took itself too seriously and it never tried to be something it wasn't. this was blue collar tv, before Rosanne (though many give that show credit for being the one that started the trend, even though Married with Children did it first....and best).Perhaps fueled by the controversy that surrounded it, the show became rather iconic even if it never was a number one show (fox was just starting out after all). But, I had never heard of a show that had such strong word of mouth and was as identifiable without being a Nielsen powerhouse. Well, not until this show turned up, same as with The Simpsons, everyone knew of the Simpsons and the catchphrases without it being  a number one show either. My favorite part is how when the show started you find Bud playing a believable son to fictional Al (who was a bit of a caricature unto himself, perhaps a character no one else could have played but Ed O'neil) and you kind of saw him as a &#34;bundy&#34; and you saw Kelly as what Al could never be (popular, loved and happy) so when the show progressed and it was Kelly who became more like Al, you kind of find it more believable when Al says what his life could have been. The young and beautiful Kelly seemed to have a promising life ahead of her, but in the end you find that life can shatter even the most promising of dreams. She was more like Al than you would have thought. He was popular in high school too. now...he's married with Children.Katy Segal plays Peggy perfectly. You can see why Al can both love her and be frustrated with her at the same time. Though you really can't understand why he wouldn't want to go to bed with her. as she is a beautiful woman, perhaps too extreme at times. There were times when the writers made her rather unlikable. I guess it helped the story along, but at the same time it made you wonder why Al would have put up with her for so long.though the details can be rather inconsistent, I don't think it matters, or that they care. Obviously they could not have done anything they did or have what they had if he really didn't make any money as a shoe salesman, and at times the over-exaggeration can be a bit trying, but they somehow managed to make you forget all of that with some great lines. Though I found Peggy wasn't given as many great lines as Al. maybe they needed more female writers I am not sure. But overall the show was great and highly rewatchable.One last thought, since this show got a lot of bad press about it's dysfunctionaltiy I would like to say that with this show, no matter how over the top they got, no matter how mean they would be to each other at times, when it really got down to it they loved each other. and they always had each other's back. While they might harass each other without a second thought no one else could. They had each other's back. that's something you don't really see in most family oriented shows, or they were more talk than action. In Married with Children you got the sense that even though they seemed like they hated each other when it came right down to it they actually cared about each other. You get the feeling too that the cast got along in real life as well, as the chemistry is strong, and though the supporting characters may seem to despise the bundys you feel as if the actors respected each other. and in the end, I believe that if a show is to be successful you not only need talented actors but you need them to have the right chemistry together. The actors all seem to respect and care for each other (you can see this more when you watch the featurettes) and that comes across In the show, and that's why it's not hard to like this rather strange but relatable family",5,not a fan of the packaging,1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,5628,"['love', 'show', 'well', 'pricing', 'packaging', 'bearable', 'box', 'two', 'plastic', 'spindles', 'hold',

1383867,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00432QAKK,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","MARRIED ... WITH CHILDREN, the legendary comedy that launched the FOX Channel (only to see Fox sort of crash and burn within less than a decade) started out as a more-sophisticated-than-you-thought comedy. It is, of course, about the Bundy Family with its mindblind leader, Al the shoe salesman (Ed O'Neill).MARRIED premiered in the middle of 1986, and the pilot was shown three times in a row that fateful Sunday night in June. Within a few years, it would be hailed as the new ALL IN THE FAMILY, which it was. Note that some sources erroneously state it premiered in 1987.So here's the whole collection, but I find it a lot more interesting to regale Amazon customers with some of the series' back-story. When the fledgling and rather pathetic FOX Channel started out, they had nothing and no idea where to go with programming. I barely recall the channel's debut at all, and I was as avid a TV fan then as I was in childhood - and still am in my own way.Two major producers, who had done LAVERNE & SHIRLEY and HAPPY DAYS, came up with the idea of a sitcom about a small Chicago family that was far from perfect. One of the studio heads later remarked about Al Bundy, ""He would not hug his kids unless they were bleeding."" Originally intended to star Roseanne (at the time n&eacute;e Barr) and the late Sam Kinison, FOX was at a loss when both comedians haughtily refused to do the show.Roseanne's sitcom (she naturally heisted the idea from MARRIED which she had refused to be in) would later challenge the basic structure of MARRIED, leading it into bizarre and often not-so-funny territory. The true and sad downfall of the show in a way was its success.Planting 'hooters' in the audience to cheer and scream the first time each star would appear on set, as they had done with HAPPY DAYS and LAVERNE & SHIRLEY when those two shows jumped the shark ... well, what can one say!MARRIED ... WITH CHILDREN was basically finished, and was also responsible for starting a trend I call ""trash TV"". I am no prude and no friend of censorship - but the garbage that MARRIED was trying to pass off as comedy, to (phony) screaming crowds was just too much. And it did indeed launch the onslaught of new TV programming that one famous critic has called a ""chum bucket"". Sad.The later seasons merely show what might have been, had they succeeded in casting Sam Kinison and Roseanne Barr - and that is not a country where you want your late-in-the-series show to be. It is all the more painful because Kate Segal and Ed O'Neill became major stars due to their work on MARRIED, and were ripped off in the form of Roseanne's show and later by Tim Allen in his show HOME IMPROVEMENT.Still I say you must get this classic. No one should claim they know TV unless they know at least the first three or four seasons of MARRIED. As for me, halfway through its run it lost its magic, its humor, one of its producers and all of its integrity. FOX didn't care. I got more fun out of telling my friends that my wife said I reminded her of Al Bundy.Every person I told that joke to, well, they knew exactly who I meant and they always laughed.MARRIED jumped the shark around 1989 or 1990, I honestly can't recall when (please NOTE THAT, irritated comment-poster!), and FOX as a channel would degrade into the mock-Bible-thumping schizophrenic side show we know today as Fox News.Anyway, get it and see what the mid-1980s were really like.",3,Three stars for pure genius which dwindled to stupidity in its last three years,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,3415,"['MARRIED', 'WITH', 'CHILDREN', 'legendary', 'comedy', 'launched', 'FOX', 'Channel', 'only', 'see', 'Fox', 'sort', 'crash', 'burn', 'less', 'decade', 'started', 'out', 'more-sophisticated-than-you-thought', 'comedy', 'course', 'Bundy', 'Family', 'mindblind', 'leader', 'Al', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", '.MARRIED', 'premiered', 'middle', '1986', 'pilot', 'was', 'shown', 'three', 'times', 'row', 'fateful', 'Sunday', 'night', 'June', 'few', 'years', 'would', 'be', 'hailed', 'new', 'ALL', 'IN', 'THE', 'FAMILY', 'was', 'Note', 'sources', 'erroneously', 'state', 'premiered', '1987.So', 'here', 'whole', 'collection', 'find', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'regale', 'Amazon', 'customers', 'series', 'back-story', 'When', 'fledgling', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'FOX', 'Channel', 'started', 'out', 'had', 'nothing', 'idea', 'where', 'go', 'programming', 'barely', 'recall', 'channel', 'debut', 'was', 'avid', 'TV', 'fan', 'then', 'was', 'childhood', 'still', 'am', 'own', 'way.Two', 'major', 'producers', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'LAVERNE', 'SHIRLEY', 'HAPPY', 'DAYS', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'sitcom', 'small', 'Chicago', 'family', 'was', 'far', 'perfect', 'One', 'studio', 'heads', 'later', 'remarked', 'Al', 'Bundy', 'would', 'not', 'hug', 'kids', 'were', 'bleeding', 'Originally', 'intended', 'star', 'Roseanne', 'time', 'n', 'eacute', 'Barr', 'late', 'Sam', 'Kinison', 'FOX', 'was', 'loss', 'when', 'comedians', 'haughtily', 'refused', 'do', 'show.Roseanne', 'sitcom', 'naturally', 'heisted', 'idea', 'MARRIED', 'had', 'refused', 'be', 'would', 'later', 'challenge', 'basic', 'structure', 'MARRIED', 'leading', 'bizarre', 'often', 'not-so-funny', 'territory', 'true', 'sad', 'downfall', 'show', 'way', 'was', 'success.Planting', ""'hooters"", 'audience', 'cheer', 'scream', 'first', 'time', 'star', 'would', 'appear', 'set', 'had', 'done', 'HAPPY', 'DAYS', 'LAVERNE', 'SHIRLEY', 'when', 'two', 'shows', 'jumped', 'shark', 'well', 'what', 'can', 'one', 'say', 'MARRIED', 'WITH', 'CHILDREN', 'was', 'basically', 'finished', 'was', 'also', 'responsible', 'starting', 'trend', 'call', 'trash', 'TV', 'am', 'prude', 'friend', 'censorship', 'garbage', 'MARRIED', 'was', 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'comedy', 'phony', 'screaming', 'crowds', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'did', 'indeed', 'launch', 'onslaught', 'new', 'TV', 'programming', 'one', 'famous', 'critic', 'called', 'chum', 'bucket', 'Sad.The', 'later', 'seasons', 'merely', 'show', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'succeeded', 'casting', 'Sam', 'Kinison', 'Roseanne', 'Barr', 'not', 'country', 'where', 'want', 'late-in-the-series', 'show', 'be', 'more', 'painful', 'Kate', 'Segal', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'became', 'major', 'stars', 'due', 'work', 'MARRIED', 'were', 'ripped', 'off', 'form', 'Roseanne', 'show', 'later', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'show', 'HOME', 'IMPROVEMENT.Still', 'say', 'must', 'get', 'classic', 'one', 'should', 'claim', 'know', 'TV', 'know', 'least', 'first', 'three', 'four', 'seasons', 'MARRIED', 'halfway', 'run', 'lost', 'magic', 'humor', 'one', 'producers', 'integrity', 'FOX', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'got', 'more', 'fun', 'telling', 'friends', 'wife', 'said', 'reminded', 'Al', 'Bundy.Every', 'person', 'told', 'joke', 'well', 'knew', 'exactly', 'who', 'meant', 'always', 'laughed.MARRIED', 'jumped', 'shark', '1989', '1990', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'when', 'please', 'NOTE', 'THAT', 'irritated', 'comment-poster', 'FOX', 'channel', 'would', 'degrade', 'mock-Bible-thumping', 'schizophrenic', 'side', 'show', 'know', 'today', 'Fox', 'News.Anyway', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'mid-1980s', 'were', 'really', 'like']",Married... with Children: The Complete Series

They think that calling each other names and being sarcastic is ""cute."" And of course it's all harmless in the end, because at the end of each episode everyone hugs and makes up and everything's copacetic.Problem is, it don't work that way in life.The teasing and the sarcasm and the name-calling become worse and worse to the point where it's no longer funny or cute. It becomes quite ugly and often spells the end of a relationship in a really awful way.I know, I know.

1383874,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B00432QAKK,JGC,"[28, 28]","Just got my complete set of this time-honored series ""Married... with Children"" and I am so excited because this was absolutely my very favorite sitcom of its time.Here are all the details about this set, also be sure to check out the pictures that I scanned and posted of everything:This is a 32 disc set of all 11 seasons. These are the exact same discs that came with the previous stand-alone sets. This includes in total 261 episodes, which is roughly 5,900 minutes of video from the series. The runtime of each of the eps ranges from just over 22 minutes to about 24 minutes in total inclusive of the opening and closing credits. All of the eps (with the exception of the ""lost ep"" that remained un-broadcast for years) are arranged in their original broadcast order.Season 1 is spread out on 2 discs, and the other 10 seasons are spread out onto 3 discs each. Each disc includes a vibrantly color silkscreen picture on it.These are region 1, single sided discs. The audio is mastered in Dolby digital, the aspect ratio is full screen, 1.33:1 and subtitles are not included although closed captioning is. One more thing that's prudent to mention, these are bona fide DVD video discs, not DVD-R or DVD+R discs that some studios are now starting to use more frequently. Also one more thing to note because this is important to some people, the set was made in the USA.This is packaged in a large bookcase with a quadruple-sized digipack inside it. The digipack includes 2 large spindles, each with roughly half the series on each side of it.The discs are held into each of the spindles by cardboard adapters. I mention this because you do not want to lose the cardboard adaptors because the discs are not locked into place on their own. Also be sure to handle them with care so they don't bend or break.The discs include an average of 6-9 eps per disc (although a handful of the discs have less). All of the discs (with the exception of season 2) are clearly marked with the season number, disc number and many of the discs even include the range of eps from the specific season on them. The only exception is that ""Season 2"" is not marked on the Season 2 discs.Special features include the cast reunion from 2003 (this was great to see again) with season 1. And some of the other seasons include ""Easter eggs"" which are brief cast commentaries (these are from the same 2003 cast reunion special) hidden on some of the discs. Some of the discs also include ""exclusive Sony previews"", these are more or less just trailers for other stuff that Sony is trying to unload. And finally, included is the infamous ""lost Bundy ep"" ""I'll See You In Court"". For some reason this ep turns up in an edited form, however.Absent from this set (as well as all other DVD sets of this classic series) is the original unaired pilot (which had a different Bud and a different Kelly) and some of the ""Married... with Children"" network specials throughout the original series run.An actual episode guide/booklet is not included. However the back of the inlay includes all of the disc contents and episode titles. Although it would have been nice if Sony would have included a booklet, I have purchased other budget sets that didn't even include the inlay so I was glad to see it. But if you're a fan of the series you probably already know what just about every show is about, also you would be reticent not to find an episode guide of ""Married... with Children"" online.All of the discs include colorful main menus with a screen imposed with episode-specific screen shots for each of the eps on the discs. I have tried out the discs on my Sony blu-ray player and Panasonic blu-ray player, as well as some of my older DVD players and cheapo under the counter kitchen DVD player and all of the discs seem to play fine. There is no skipping and no compatiblity issues withsoever. I should also say that the picture and sound quality is excellent.Although some of the eps are edited and some of the music is changed I can hardly find anything else to complain about. This is such an awesome series and at this price they're practically giving it away. I say if you have any interest in the series snatch up your copy now because the price could go up or it could sell out.Some background about the show, which, if you're here you may already know:The star of the series is Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill, he was the best pick for this role, I cannot imagine anyone else as the iconic Al Bundy). Al is the perpetual, typical husband who just can't catch a break no matter how hard he tries. Peggy Bundy (Katey Sagal who was always able to deliver the sharpest cracks) is Al's love-starved wife. Peggy is just as horny as she is lazy. The woman has a serious aversion to work and enjoys passing her time smoking on the couch, watching Oprah and eating bonbons. Bud Bundy (David Faustino, who was also first-rate in all of his Bud incarnations over the years) is Al and Peg's son. Bud is totally the most intelligent person in this family, however he often gets sidetracked if there's a hot chick involved. Kelly (Christina Applegate, who played the hottest and dumbest blonde on TV since Chrissy Snow) is the daughter of the family and such a sweet girl. Kelly has lofty dreams of being a model but first she'll need to master the art of turning a doorknob. Al can often be seen defending his daughter's honor because he wouldn't ever allow anyone to take advantage of his little ""Pumpkin."" As a matter of fact, even though he'd never admit it, Al is just as protective of both Peggy and Bud, too.I gotta say Ed O'Neill was absolutely perfect. He played the hopeless and harried shoe salesman with such finesse, it truly is a shame he didn't get nominated for an Emmy because he more than deserved it. Ed was always believable, always hysterical and had some of the best facial expressions of any sitcom character in recent memory.Rounding out this very interesting group of characters is Marcy D'Arcy, you gotta love that name (Amanda Bearse who exceptionally played a character that got more and more ludicrous over the years), and Jefferson D'Arcy (Ted McGinley, who has been dubbed ""the patron saint of shark-jumping"") the Bundys' neighbors. Marcy and Al have a very serious hatred for each other. I think this is because both are threatened by each other; Al is a man who isn't afraid to say what he wants and Marcy is a total man-hater.Jefferson is Marcy's pretty boy second hubby. He's basically the male version of Peggy. Steve Rhoades (David Garrison) was Marcy's first-hubby who dumped her quicker than a dirty towel in a men's room truck stop to become a park ranger. It was wonderful to see David come back to the series for pretty frequent eps over the years. The debate over who was better, Steve or Jefferson will probably go on for years to come. I say, some of the very best eps are with Steve, but I like Jefferson better because he added a unique aspect to the show.Some of my favorite eps are also some of your favorite eps, I'm sure:Earth Angel / Season 2 / disc 1 - Bud picks up a hot blonde he meets who doesn't have any place to go. When Al sees her in her slinky nighty he plays the bedroom Bossanova with Peggy all night long. My favorite part is when Peggy comes running down the stairs in the morning to tell Tiffany to stay, forever.Master The Possibilities / Season 2 / disc 1 - Buck gets a credit card and Al and Peggy go on a spending spree. My favorite part is the very end when Al has to ""work off"" his debt with the hotel by scrubbing some fat woman's back.Impo-Dent / Season 2 / disc 3 - Steve fakes a sexual dysfunction to get even with Marcy.The Gypsy Cried / Season 3 / disc 2 - A psychic forewarns Marcy that she is in grave danger, so Marcy decides to bring along Peg and Al on a business trip for good look.Hot Off The Grill / Season 4 / disc 1 - While planning a labor day picnic Peggy turns on Al. Meanwhile, Kelly mistakenly use the ashes of Marcy's beloved late aunt in the barbecue. My favorite part is Steve's expression when he finds out the burger was cooked with the old lady's ashes, he just smiles and digs right in.You Better Shop Around (part 1 & 2) / Season 5 / disc 3 - After moving into a grocery store (because Al blacked out the entire neighborhood on the hottest day of the year with his ""Kaiser"" air conditioner) Al and Peggy win a supermarket shopping spree. But they have to compete against Jefferson and Marcy. The Beav even makes a special appearance in the second part.Route 666 (part 1 & 2) / Season 5 / disc 3 - On a road trip to CA the Bundys get sidetracked in an old mining town. After hearing that there is gold in them there hills Peggy comes up with a cockamamie story claming that Kelly, Bud and Al are desperately sick, asking Marcy to wire money. When Marcy and Jefferson show up instead and learn the truth, soon the Bundys and D'Arcys become gold prospectors.Throughout the decade+ it was on the airwaves ""Married... with Children"" included a ton of always funny and always in-your-face celebrity guest stars. Some of the best of the best include: Mr. Waylon Jennings, Tammy Wynette, Linda Blair, Charlene Tilton, Vanna White, Jessica Hahn, Robert Englund, Gary Coleman, Sam Kinison and Pat Morita.The reason why I love this series so much is because it never pretended to be anything than what it was. It never preached to the audience. It never put on airs. No one tried to ""educate"" the viewers. No one tried to give a ""moral"" to the story. And most of all the reason why I consider ""Married... with Children"" to be the defining sitcom of the '80s (and the '90s) is because it never tried to end each show with a ""happy ending"". Nope. They were miserable and they were staying miserable.Remember, love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage.",5,Can I get a Whoa Bundy,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,9801,"['Just', 'got',

1383897,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B00432QAKK,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","Married with Children was one of the iconic sitcoms in the late 80s and most of the 90s. It was a total spoof of the feel good sitcoms of the 1980s like The Cosby Show, Facts of Life, Family Ties etc as well as a spoof of shows like All In The Family and The Jefferson's whose main characters were what the character of Al Bundy was definitely based (at least in part) upon. It premiered at a time just before the whole &#34;political correctness&#34; phase kicked in, and probably only lasted as long as it did because it came on when Fox was just a fledgeling network.The show, especially in the early years was totally crass, never took anything all that seriously and made fun of itself along with everything else. The whole concept was a totally over the top dysfunctional family with &#34;normal&#34; neighbors. I personally think the best seasons were when David Garrison was a regular on the show, because the character Steve really did a great job of balancing out Al while sometimes secretly wanting to be like him. But all throughout the series the actors had very good chemistry and seemed to have a lot of fun playing the characters which is part of what made the show great. There were tons of great guest stars in cameo roles over the course of the series ranging from Sam Kinison (in the wonderful episode which spoofed It's a Wonderful Life) to Vanna White.My only real disappointment with the series is that the final season really felt forced. There were some funny episodes in it, but it did not seem all that necessary and gave the show a feeling of hanging on too long. The last episode was really disappointing in that it did not have all the characters in it, did not bring David Garrison back for a cameo and really felt like just another episode. There was no sense of finality to the series that a show that had been on the air that long should have had. I am not sure if the 11th season ended with the possibility of coming back for a 12th which is why they did not end with a proper series finale or if that was just the decision for the final episode, but it really did fall flat.As far as the set goes. There are two packaging options one that has the individual seasons in their own boxes and another that just has all the discs in two big spindles. Either way the content is the same. In the first few seasons there are some bonus material (mainly the reunion special) then some behind the scenes stuff. After that it is just the episodes themselves. The biggest change from what was broadcast is they lost the rights to use the Love and Marriage theme song in the opening credits of the DVDs after season 2, so from season 3 on they use a canned instrumental opening.Overall, if you were a fan of the show, even though it probably did hang around a season or two too long, and the limitations of the DVD release it is worth getting. The A/V quality is about what you would expect from a show as old as this one and there could be more extras, but regardless of all that it is probably the best release there will be and it is well worth picking up.",4,A great sitcom that never got a proper farewell,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,3082,"['Married', 'Children', 'was', 'one', 'iconic', 'sitcoms', 'late', '80s', 'most', '90s', 'was', 'total', 'spoof', 'feel', 'good', 'sitcoms', '1980s', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Facts', 'Life', 'Family', 'Ties', 'etc', 'as', 'well', 'spoof', 'shows', 'Family', 'Jefferson', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'what', 'character', 'Al', 'Bundy', 'was', 'definitely', 'based', 'least', 'part', 'upon', 'premiered', 'time', 'just', 'whole', '34', 'political', 'correctness', '34', 'phase', 'kicked', 'probably', 'only', 'lasted', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'came', 'when', 'Fox', 'was', 'just', 'fledgeling', 'network.The', 'show', 'especially', 'early', 'years', 'was', 'totally', 'crass', 'never', 'took', 'anything', 'seriously', 'made', 'fun', 'everything', 'else', 'whole', 'concept', 'was', 'totally', 'top', 'dysfunctional', 'family', '34', 'normal', '34', 'neighbors', 'personally', 'think', 'best', 'seasons', 'were', 'when', 'David', 'Garrison', 'was', 'regular', 'show', 'character', 'Steve', 'really', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'balancing', 'out', 'Al', 'sometimes', 'secretly', 'wanting', 'be', 'series', 'actors', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'chemistry', 'seemed', 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'playing', 'characters', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'great', 'were', 'tons', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'cameo', 'roles', 'course', 'series', 'ranging', 'Sam', 'Kinison', 'wonderful', 'episode', 'spoofed', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Vanna', 'White.My', 'only', 'real', 'disappointment', 'series', 'final', 'season', 'really', 'felt', 'forced', 'were', 'funny', 'episodes', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'necessary', 'gave', 'show', 'feeling', 'hanging', 'too', 'long', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'really', 'disappointing', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'characters', 'did', 'not', 'bring', 'David', 'Garrison', 'back', 'cameo', 'really', 'felt', 'like', 'just', 'episode', 'was', 'sense', 'finality', 'series', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'air', 'long', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'am', 'not', 'sure', '11th', 'season', 'ended', 'possibility', 'coming', 'back', '12th', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'proper', 'series', 'finale', 'was', 'just', 'decision', 'final', 'episode', 'really', 'did', 'fall', 'flat.As', 'far', 'set', 'are', 'two', 'packaging', 'options', 'one', 'individual', 'seasons', 'own', 'boxes', 'just', 'discs', 'two', 'big', 'spindles', 'way', 'content', 'same', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'are', 'bonus', 'material', 'mainly', 'reunion', 'special', 'then', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'just', 'episodes', 'biggest', 'change', 'what', 'was', 'broadcast', 'lost', 'rights', 'use', 'Love', 'Marriage', 'theme', 'song', 'opening', 'credits', 'DVDs', 'season', '2', 'so', 'season', '3', 'use', 'canned', 'instrumental', 'opening.Overall', 'were', 'fan', 'show', 'even', 'probably', 'did', 'hang', 'season', 'two', 'too', 'long', 'limitations', 'DVD', 'release', 'worth', 'getting', 'A/V', 'quality', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'show', 'as', 'old', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'extras', 'regardless', 'probably', 'best', 'release', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'worth', 'picking', 'up']",Married... with Children: The Complete Series
1383898,A2ARDVMUGDFED6,B00432QAKK,MiRSD,"[7, 8]","(Let me start by saying I'd give the SHOW itself a 5/5.. I'd give the boxset/packaging about a 2.5)I grew up watching this show as a kid (which I probably should'nt have!) and always found it hilarious. It revolves around a 'dysfunctional' family and their neighbors.Al, the dad, hates life and works in a womens show store.Peg, the wife, is about as lazy as they get, spending all day on the couch watching Oprah and eating bon-bons.Kelly, the 'hot daughter' is about as ditzy as they come.Bud, the younger brother, is always trying to get with some girl. Any girl.Buck, the talking dog.Then there are the neighbors - Marcy ""the chicken"" darcy, who is always trying to fight for some cause (usually against Al), her Husband in the earlier episodes (Steve) or her unemployed boyfriend Jefferson (the later episodes).The show really seemed ahead of itself, and a lot of the content just wouldn't fly on network TV today (lots of ""Fat lady walked into the shoe store today.."", ""NO MAAM organization"", and other rude jokes that just come off as hilarious! This is also probably a good time to point out that women just hate this show, while most men find it hilarious. This is one to watch without the wife/girlfriend, or you might end up sleeping in the doghouse.Each episode is pretty much stand-alone and can be watched in any order, as it doesn't follow a storyline. There are a few multi-park episodes (vacation episodes), but for the most part you can pop in any disc/episode and just enjoy it on it's own.The discs were previously released as 11 individual sets, then compiled into a boxset:Married...with Children: The Complete Series- each of these contains the SAME DISCS -- they're just a repackaging (it's also very obvious, as the disc arts show little continuity.. some will say ""The complete First Season - Disc 1"", others will say ""Disc 2"" (without the season), some will list the episode #s contained on the discs. Overall, this is really only worth noting so that you're aware these discs were NOT remastered at all (they still look/sound good), so if you own the previous releases.. no need to buy this. If you don't own the previous releases, you're not missing anything with this version (some re-issues make changes to the content)Because these are the same discs as before.. that also means an unwelcome change for many: Starting with Season 3 (and through the end) the ""Love and the marriage"" theme was changed on the DVD release (likely due to a right issue with the song, and not wanting to pay for it any longer). Many find this change to be unforgivable, but it is only the theme song that's affected -- if you skip it, you don't need to worry about it. Season 1 & 2 have the original theme intact.Each season is spread across 3 discs (with the exception of Season 1, which is 2 discs), bringing a total of 32 discs, 261 episodes, or almost 100 hours of the show!Extras are lacking throughout the set - Season 1 has a neat reunion special (about 45 minutes, from the early 2000's), getting the whole cast back together. Seasons 2/3 have some easter eggs, but there are really no extras (especially from Season 4 on) - it would have been nice to get a commentary on a few episodes at least.Video is presented in its original 1.33:1 (fullscreen) - on an HDTV it will have black bars on the side (or will be stretched) - this is normal. Audio also sounds good, but for a TV show from 1987-1997, you can't expect too much.The big difference in this set, compared to the previous boxset, is how the discs are packaged.The box looks the same, but is shrunken down to only 3 inches wide -- this is done by removing the discs from their original sets and stacking them onto 2 plastic spindles housed inside of a cardboard foldout. The box itself, and even the foldout, look good - the problem is with the storage itself.The cardboard foldout is housed inside of a slipcover - once you pull it out, it folds open (showing pictures of Peg and Al), and each of those folds out again (showing pictures of Kelly and Bud), with a set of discs underneath.This is Sony's new way of packaging these sets (which allows them to keep a lower price). The problem is that the plastic disc holder/spindle has problems: It's a very flimsy plastic material (almost like something you'd expect from a microwavable TV dinner), not even as sturdy as a spindle you'd find with recordable CDs/DVDs).The package has 2 of these spindles - one for Seasons 1-6 and one for Seasons 7-11. The discs are stacked on top of eachother with no protection from eachother. At the top of each spindle is a piece of plain brown cardboard to hold it in place (and keep them from spilling/rattling around in the case). Not only does this look cheap/bad, the discs get scratched very easily -- opening the box (new) for the first time, about 2/3rds of the discs had bad scuff marks on them. Another issue is the quality control - I checked all 32 discs to make sure I received them all, only to find there were 33 discs (2 ""Season 3 - disc 3s"") - if you purchase this set, definitely check that you receive all 32 discs (an extra isn't bad, but if you're missing a disc or receive 2 of the incorrect discs, it's a big problem).  Because of this, and how the discs are unprotected/arrive damaged, I think this packaging is a very bad idea.I bought aDVD Repair Machine / Kitfrom Amazon a while ago, so I can repair these if needed, but most will need to replace the set and hope for the best.On the back of the box is a glued on piece of paper -- removing this and flipping it over will give a disc-by-disc episode breakdown of the entire series, letting you know episode titles and locations (Season 2, disc 1 - for example). I wish they would've done this differently, as the paper has to be removed from the back (it's glued on backwards, as the back has the UPC/description). A separate insert or even having it printed inside the case would have been much preferred.In the end, the show is fantastic. The boxset, unfortunately, isnt.. but it comes in at a cheap enough price that it's somewhat forgiveable.If you don't want to chance it, or want to have real cases, check out the boxset linked above. It is about 50% higher in price, but that's only 20 bucks difference, which may be worth it.",4,"Great show, but boxset isn't without it's issues",1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,6273,"['Let', 'start',

1383918,A2NXAV1SNXWA9H,B00432QAKK,S. R.,"[150, 155]","This review will not focus on the merits of this classic TV show since anyone visiting this page already likes it enough to possibly buy the entire series on DVD.  Rather, this review will hopefully clear up the confusion regarding exactly what is being offered with this Complete Series collection.  Sony originally released the individual seasons on DVD from 2003 to 2009.  This 2010 Complete Series collection simply repackages the exact same DVDs from the individual seasons.  There are 32 discs in all spanning the entire 11 seasons for a total of 261 episodes.  Unfortunately, there is no episode list included showing what episodes are on each disc.  The bonus content is slim and includes:Season 1- 42 minute 2003 reunion special with all of the principal cast members.Season 2- 13 hidden ""Easter Eggs"" featuring short interview clips with the cast.Season 3- 10 hidden ""Easter Eggs"" of cast interview clips + the unaired ""I'll See You in Court"" episode.Seasons 4 to 11- No series related extras.It should be noted that the opening theme has been replaced with generic music starting with season 3 due to music licensing issues.  Also, season 4 has 7 episodes that are the syndicated versions, meaning each is missing about a minute of footage from the original broadcast versions. All other seasons appear to have the original, uncut episodes.  The video is presented in its original full frame 1.33:1 aspect ratio and the audio is in 2.0 Dolby digital stereo.  Neither the picture nor sound quality shows any noticeable signs of remastering but are still generally good considering the age of the series.  The packaging is also worth mentioning as it is very different than the individual season sets.  The discs are housed inside a cardboard box measuring approximately 7.5""H x 5""W x 5.5""D.  Inside the box, there is a fold-out digi-pack with 9 clear plastic trays stacked on top of one other on either side, holding 2 overlapping discs per tray, with 4 trays holding 1 disc each.  Only time will tell just how well this case keeps its contents secure, but in terms of being a space-saver, this excels over other complete series DVD sets.  In 2011, Sony re-released anotherMarried...With Children: The Complete SeriesDVD set but with much cheaper packaging comprised of discs stacked on top of one another in two separate spindles.  The re-packaged version is clearly the better option for those on a tight budget, but the original digi-pack release is superior in terms of its convenience and better protection of discs.  Over all, despite some of the aforementioned drawbacks, there are still enough positives with the Complete Series collection to entice fans who do not already own the individual season releases.",4,Woah Bundy!,1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,2727,"['review', 'will', 'not', 'focus', 'merits', 'classic', 'TV', 'show', 'anyone', 'visiting', 'page', 'already', 'enough', 'possibly', 'buy', 'entire', 'series', 'DVD', 'Rather', 'review', 'will', 'hopefully', 'clear', 'up', 'confusion', 'regarding', 'exactly', 'what', 'being', 'offered', 'Complete', 'Series', 'collection', 'Sony', 'originally', 'released', 'individual', 'seasons', 'DVD', '2003', '2009', '2010', 'Complete', 'Series', 'collection', 'simply', 'exact', 'same', 'DVDs', 'individual', 'seasons', 'are', '32', 'discs', 'spanning', 'entire', '11', 'seasons', 'total', '261', 'episodes', 'Unfortunately', 'episode', 'list', 'included', 'showing', 'what', 'episodes', 'are', 'disc', 'bonus', 'content', 'slim', 'Season', '1-', '42', 'minute', '2003', 'reunion', 'special', 'principal', 'cast', 'members.Season', '2-', '13', 'hidden', 'Easter', 'Eggs', 'featuring', 'short', 'interview', 'clips', 'cast.Season', '3-', '10', 'hidden', 'Easter', 'Eggs', 'cast', 'interview', 'clips', '+', 'unaired', ""'ll"", 'See', 'Court', '4', '11-', 'No', 'series', 'related', 'extras.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'opening', 'theme', 'been', 'replaced', 'generic', 'music', 'starting', 'season', '3', 'due', 'music', 'licensing', 'issues', 'Also', 'season', '4', '7', 'episodes', 'are', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'meaning', 'missing', 'minute', 'footage', 'original', 'broadcast', 'versions', 'other', 'seasons', 'appear', 'have', 'original', 'uncut', 'episodes', 'video', 'presented', 'original', 'full', 'frame', '1.33:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'audio', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'digital', 'stereo', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'noticeable', 'signs', 'remastering', 'are', 'still', 'generally', 'good', 'considering', 'age', 'series', 'packaging', 'also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'very', 'different', 'individual', 'season', 'sets', 'discs', 'are', 'housed', 'cardboard', 'box', 'measuring', 'approximately', '7.5', 'H', 'x', '5', 'W', 'x', '5.5', 'D.', 'Inside', 'box', 'fold-out', 'digi-pack', '9', 'clear', 'plastic', 'trays', 'stacked', 'top', 'one', 'other', 'side', 'holding', '2', 'overlapping', 'discs', 'tray', '4', 'trays', 'holding', '1', 'disc', 'Only', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'case', 'contents', 'secure', 'terms', 'being', 'space-saver', 'excels', 'other', 'complete', 'series', 'DVD', 'sets', '2011', 'Sony', 're-released', 'anotherMarried', 'Children', 'Complete', 'SeriesDVD', 'set', 'much', 'cheaper', 'packaging', 'comprised', 'discs', 'stacked', 'top', 'one', 'two', 'separate', 'spindles', 're-packaged', 'version', 'clearly', 'better', 'option', 'tight', 'budget', 'original', 'digi-pack', 'release', 'superior', 'terms', 'convenience', 'better', 'protection', 'discs', 'aforementioned', 'drawbacks', 'are', 'still', 'enough', 'positives', 'Complete', 'Series', 'collection', 'entice', 'fans', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'already', 'own', 'individual', 'season', 'releases']",Married... with Children: The Complete Series
