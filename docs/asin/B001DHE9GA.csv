I do however like a good sci-fi comedy, so when I saw this recommended based on other movies and tv shows I thought well I'll just rent it as it seems like something both of us could agree on.In the end I think the both of us did agree ""It's no Red Dwarf"".  The concept and descriptions are, in our opinions, much better than the actual execution.We have The Head - just what his name implies, a giant head that appears on a screen.  He's the big boss.  Palindrome - he's Quark's immediate boss, running the base where Quark is stationed and acting as the intermediary between The Head and Quark and the others.  Ficus - a Vegeton aka a plant in human form, very Spock like personality wise (he replaces a professor from the pilot episode, luckily - as that character didn't quite work).  Andy - the robot who gets one of the best scenes of the series but otherwise is pretty annoying.  The Betties - one Betty is the ""real Betty"" and one is a clone, they spend the series fighting over which is which.  Gene/Jean - a transmute, both male and female, more male than female but switching at random potentially leading to interesting situations.  And last but not least, Quark.  Ahh Quark - the space garbage man who complains a lot about garbage duty and yet realizes if he wants to get ahead and someday end up with a real ship he needs to play nice and do everything that is asked of him, work his way up through the ranks.  He also somehow almost never really ends up picking up garbage but instead ends up in the worst of the worst situations and never really gets credit for that.Sounds fun, right?  It sort of is.  Still as we watched we couldn't help but feel as though the person who came up with the idea handed it over to people who didn't quite follow through properly.  We'd find ourselves saying ""If they'd done this instead...""

Everyone involved with this show forgot the basic idea behind a comedy: being funny.Right from the opening theme you know you're in trouble. The music is a definite reference to Star Trek, but the visuals are nothing but trite sci-fi cliches. Couldn't they have done something a little bit funny for the opening they'd show every week? I don't think the idea occurred to them. (I almost forgot-- Conrad Janis does something weird with his eyes. ha freakin' ha)The pilot episode should be banned forever as a form of unbearable torture. The second episode shows that serious re-thinking of the show was done, and a new character, Ficus was added. They should have re-thought the idea of doing the show at all. From the unbearable torture of the pilot episode, the remaining episodes sometimes make it all the way up to ""really lame"".Ficus actually is the best part of the show, but perhaps Star Trek's Spock is just so parody-able. But as you watch Ficus, you end up wishing that you could transport him out of this show into one that had decent writers and decent co-stars.Richard Benjamin (Quark) has all the comic presence and timing of a used tea bag. With him as the star, it wouldn't matter if the writing didn't stink, the direction didn't stink, and the visuals didn't stink. Benjamin is enough to sink the show on his own.The other actors appear game, but they don't have anything to work with. The character of Gene/Jean is just stupid. Betty and Betty have nothing to do. Andy the robot sounds like his lines were written by a third-grader.A comedy has the right to use some really bad special effects. And if they had tried to work that angle, there could have been some laughs. But they want to be impressive and then make such stupid mistakes as using exactly the same model ships to represent both the good guys and the bad guys.

1180393,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001DHE9GA,Mark Turner,"[14, 26]","I've read fan writings concerning this show that hail it as the next best thing since sliced bread. But the whole time I was watching it all I could think of was what were they watching that I wasn't?Could it be one of those shows you watched as a kid that you remember fondly yet when you view it as an adult you realize how wrong you were? I grew up in the seventies and didn't get to see this show before it was pulled. As I watch it now on DVD I'm amazed less that there are fans than by the fact it wasn't pulled sooner.Richard Benjamin stars as Adam Quark, the captain of a spaceship responsible for picking up intergalactic garbage. Cheesy effects show the ship reaching out with mechanical hands to lift and intake a giant green garbage bag while floating in space. And that's one of the funniest jokes it offers.Tim Thomerson (an unappreciated actor) plays Gene/Jean, a hybrid of male/female parts whose demeanor changes depending on who is in control at the moment. While this character has some of the funniest moments, it is a one note joke that falls flat fast.Conrad Janis of MORK AND MINDY fame is the desk jockey that sends Quark and his crew out on ridiculous missions. A catastrophic attack is planned on our galaxy. Who best to send? Quark and the garbage scow!The show came out around the time that science fiction was at an all time high. With the success of STAR WARS in theaters and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA on television, one would think that the world was ripe for a parody of the genre. It was. But this was not the one to do it right. The short film HARDWARE WARS was funnier in less than 15 minutes than this entire series.The creator behind the series was Buck Henry. It hadn't been long since Henry had teamed up with writer Mel Brooks (yes writer as he had yet to direct yet) to make one of the funniest spoofs seen on television, GET SMART. After watching QUARK I thought back to the laughs from SMART and from Brooks other films. It left me with the feeling that the best of SMART came from Brooks and not Henry.I've seen this show called a spoof, a parody and a satire of the times. And yet while watching it, and yes I did sit through it, I was left wondering where the charm was for this series so hailed by its fans. Where was the wit? Where was the comedy? Most importantly, where were the laughs (other than those on the overused laugh track)?I never cracked a smile during the entire running time. I never found myself drawn in by the cheesiness of the sets and effects. I understood that they were attempting humor with them but they weren't the least bit funny.So what does that make QUARK in the long run? A show that die hard fans have longed for and now have the chance to own. A memory that may not live up to the hype or those same memories of what it was. At worst, is it a show that was low on laughs. I would recommend this series to one group of people: its fans.

Quark, NBC's fantastic science-fiction spoof from the mind of Buck Henry, was released about the same time as Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century and Battlestar Galactica were making their impact on the science fiction community. The short-lived series featured Richard Benjamin as Adam Quark along with his crazy crew aboard a spacefaring garbage scow.  Well ahead of it's time, the series has become a cult classic with precious few original copies available -- until now! Buck Henry's oddball creation will easily bring you back (and forth) in time.  Although Amazon briefly covers what the series is all about, here's a little more information on the crew...Our hero, Adam Quark (Richard Benjamin) commands the United Galaxy Sanitation Patrol ship. Quark's mission?  To collect space baggies from United Galactic spacecraft.  His other mission? Always getting himself into (and out of) trouble.Quark's love interests are Betty I and Betty II (Cyb and Patricia Barnstable, the Doublemint twins of the 70s). The Betties co-pilot and co-co-pilot the 23rd century starship. The pretty one is the clone.Ficus Pandorata (Richard Kelton) is a Vegeton. He is the ship's half-man, half-plant, Spock-like science officer.  Wait until you see how he mates!Gene/Jean (Timothy Thomerson) is a transmute. He/she has an equal number of male and female chromosomes (i.e., he's half-man, half-woman). His male half is never around when Quark needs it -- typically during a fight.Quark's bosses are Dr. Otto Palindrome (Conrad Janis from Mork and Mindy) and an entity simply known as The Head (Alan Caillou).  The head is a disembodied head floating through space.  Together, they rule the galaxy!  Well, not really.  They rule Quark, and that's good enough for constant laughs.

If you believe that, then you may have never seen Quark.Produced from 1977-78, Quark starred Richard Benjamin as Adam Quark, Captain of the  United Galactic Sanitation Patrol ship, Richard Kelton as Fiscus (vegetable-human officer), Tricia and Cyb Barstable as Betty and Betty, clone twin engineers (for the price of one), and Timothy Thomerson as Gene/Jean, a transmute male/female officer.  Conrad Janis of Mork and Mindy fame, played Palindrome, and the `Head' included the top half of the shoulders of Alan Cailou.

But, you can do anything with the Source (this is not a commercial for Radio Shack) if you only believe in it...anything...except explain just how Betty and Betty manage to hang onto Captain Quark in times of trouble, and those darned Daisy Duke short sets in the middle of space.  There must be some kind of fashion program at Perma One.  Gene/jean is funny however, as the he-she character switches at the wrong (did I break a nail) times.  As a science officer, Fiscus, is intelligent, but annoying.  The `Head' used here is obviously inspiration for Third Rock (and Shatner) who did the floating head routine so much better inspite of needing singing lessons.While the characters are memorable, the episodes suffer from something resembling too much effort for so little return.  Even the laugh track seems strained.  The stunts just stink at time.

Ryan ""mstee-arrrr""","[1, 3]","This rather trippy late 1970's early 1980's light comedy series (lasting a mere 8 episodes) was, I gather, a piss-take on the run of sci-fi movies doing the rounds at the time, a bit of Alien, Star Wars, Battlestar Gallactica, Buck Rogers, Spaceballs and even Star Trek.  It featured Richard Benjamin (Westworld) in the title role of Adam Quark, commander of a Garbage Scow spacecraft, with the raucous crew consisting of Clone(ttes) Betty/Betty (played by twins Cyb & Trisha Barnsdale) a trans-mute Gene/Jean (played by Timothy Thomerson) a vegetoid (?) Ficus (played by Richard Kelton) and a deranged & cowardly android named Andy (voiced by Bobby Porter).  Each episode commences at the base station of 'Perma-One' run by Pallendrome (Conrad Janis of Mork & Mindy) and 'Headed' (pardon the pun) by his boss known only as 'The Head' (played by Alan Calliou).  The storylines are a little on the 'under-done' side, in the original (first) episode there was another Crew member named Doc whose only mission was to tend to Andy, and then without so much as a whisper he was written out and replaced with Ficus (his introduction to the series was never included).  The odd 'guest' star such as Melody Anderson playing Interface (a space tele-communications operator with 4 arms) and Hans Conreid voicing a character called 'The Source' was a slight relief to the tedium.  Originally written by Buck Henry (Get Smart), it suffered at times with a lack-lustre script and storylines, the old chestnut of 'The good, the bad and the ficus' was a direct rip-off of a Star Trek episode of split dimensions good Kirk & bad Kirk, was a rather desperate and sadly failed attempt to CPR this beast.  I recall seeing the series when it was originally shown - I enjoyed it then for its quirkiness (or is that quarkiness??), however nearly 30 years on, it wont be remembered as a pioneer of 'space' comedy, rather more as a brief blip on the scan-o-scope. Bit of a giggle - and alot of kitsch!",3,The Universe ad-infinitum or is it ad-nauseum???,1289174400,"11 8, 2010",2010,1977,"['rather', 'trippy', 'late', '1970', 'early', '1980', 'light', 'comedy', 'series', 'lasting', 'mere', '8', 'episodes', 'was', 'gather', 'piss-take', 'run', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'doing', 'rounds', 'time', 'bit', 'Alien', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Battlestar', 'Gallactica', 'Buck', 'Rogers', 'Spaceballs', 'even', 'Star', 'Trek', 'featured', 'Richard', 'Benjamin', 'Westworld', 'title', 'role', 'Adam', 'Quark', 'commander', 'Garbage', 'Scow', 'spacecraft', 'raucous', 'crew', 'consisting', 'Clone', 'ttes', 'Betty/Betty', 'played', 'twins', 'Cyb', 'Trisha', 'Barnsdale', 'trans-mute', 'Gene/Jean', 'played', 'Timothy', 'Thomerson', 'vegetoid', 'Ficus', 'played', 'Richard', 'Kelton', 'deranged', 'cowardly', 'android', 'named', 'Andy', 'voiced', 'Bobby', 'Porter', 'episode', 'commences', 'base', 'station', ""'Perma-One"", 'run', 'Pallendrome', 'Conrad', 'Janis', 'Mork', 'Mindy', ""'Headed"", 'pun', 'boss', 'known', 'only', ""'The"", 'Head', 'played', 'Alan', 'Calliou', 'storylines', 'are', 'little', ""'under-done"", 'side', 'original', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'Crew', 'member', 'named', 'Doc', 'only', 'mission', 'was', 'tend', 'Andy', 'then', 'so', 'much', 'whisper', 'was', 'written', 'out', 'replaced', 'Ficus', 'introduction', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'included', 'odd', 'star', 'such', 'Melody', 'Anderson', 'playing', 'Interface', 'space', 'tele-communications', 'operator', '4', 'arms', 'Hans', 'Conreid', 'voicing', 'character', 'called', ""'The"", 'Source', 'was', 'slight', 'relief', 'tedium', 'Originally', 'written', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'Get', 'Smart', 'suffered', 'times', 'lack-lustre', 'script', 'storylines', 'old', 'chestnut', ""'The"", 'good', 'bad', 'ficus', 'was', 'direct', 'rip-off', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episode', 'split', 'dimensions', 'good', 'Kirk', 'bad', 'Kirk', 'was', 'rather', 'desperate', 'sadly', 'failed', 'attempt', 'CPR', 'beast', 'recall', 'seeing', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'shown', 'enjoyed', 'then', 'quirkiness', 'quarkiness', 'however', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'wont', 'be', 'remembered', 'pioneer', ""'space"", 'comedy', 'rather', 'more', 'brief', 'blip', 'scan-o-scope', 'Bit', 'giggle', 'alot', 'kitsch']",Quark - The Complete Series
