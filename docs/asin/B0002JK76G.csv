I haven't yet purchased a region-free DVD player (WHY are DVDs made with region codes????  They should have been made like CDs and we wouldn't have to even talk about it...), but I've purchased some of these PAL versions because: (#1) I WILL purchase a region-free DVD player in the future (they are VERY inexpensive and GOOD quality too, believe it or not) and (#2) They are watchable in the meantime on the computer.  Therefore, it's completely fine with me that these are being sold to U.S. customers.  Plus, MANY of these episodes are currently unavailable in the U.S. due to the inexplicably SLOW and ERRATIC release schedule of BBC America.
