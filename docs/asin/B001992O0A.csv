It was always the highlight of my week when, at eight o'clock on Tuesday evenings I would sit down in front of the TV to watch 911. Of course I was delighted when I discovered that the Family Channel was also airing the show, not just every day, but at one point two episodes per day. Of course I was rarely able to watch the one at noon being in school, but I would always catch the nine o'clock one. Which meant two episodes of 911 on Tuesday, first the one on CBS at eight, then the nine o'clock one on the Family Channel, and three per day sometimes on those rare occasions when I was at home at noon.For those who don't know, Rescue 911 was a reality TV show hosted by William Shatner that retold true stories of people rescued from emergency situations. Many were reenactments of past emergencies, but some were actually filmed on the scene of events as they happened, usually hospitals in which several different events occurred simultaneously.The show first aired in 1989 and ran until 1996, after which it was aired in sindication for a time. Unfortunately, to my knowledge it's not being aired on any network in the US anymore, which is why I really hope they do actually decide to release the series on DVD.One of the things I really liked about Rescue 911 was that the stories it told nearly always ended happily, though there were exceptions when one or more of the victims didn't survive. I was amazed that some of the people on the show survived, let alone made such complete recoveries from their ordeals. There were also occasionally some more lighthearted incidents, such as the burglar who attempted to break into a house posing as Santa Claus only to get stuck hanging head down in the chimney, or the woman who came home to discover what she thought was a burglar standing in her front entry and called the police only to discover that it was a maniquin. Another favorite was the burglar who broke into a store only to become trapped inside and had to call 911 in order to get out.One of the other things I always found most memorable about the show was its theme music. At first it actually scared me a little bit but I got used to it after a while and then I couldn't get enough of it, from the opening theme with its sound and video clips to its closing theme with the memorable ending of ""Mr. Shapiro, step out of the car please,"" just as the music draws to its close.So again I really do hope they actually do decide to release Rescue 911 on DVD, or that they start airing it in sindication on US TV again. I've really missed that show!",5,I hope it does come out on DVD.,1227398400,"11 23, 2008",2008,2618,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Rescue', '911', 'least', 'ten', 'years', 'was', 'always', 'highlight', 'week', 'when', 'eight', ""o'clock"", 'Tuesday', 'evenings', 'would', 'sit', 'down', 'front', 'TV', 'watch', '911', 'course', 'was', 'delighted', 'when', 'discovered', 'Family', 'Channel', 'was', 'also', 'airing', 'show', 'not', 'just', 'day', 'one', 'point', 'two', 'episodes', 'day', 'course', 'was', 'rarely', 'able', 'watch', 'one', 'noon', 'being', 'school', 'would', 'always', 'catch', 'nine', ""o'clock"", 'one', 'meant', 'two', 'episodes', '911', 'Tuesday', 'first', 'one', 'CBS', 'eight', 'then', 'nine', ""o'clock"", 'one', 'Family', 'Channel', 'three', 'day', 'sometimes', 'rare', 'occasions', 'when', 'was', 'home', 'noon.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Rescue', '911', 'was', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'hosted', 'William', 'Shatner', 'retold', 'true', 'stories', 'people', 'rescued', 'emergency', 'situations', 'Many', 'were', 'reenactments', 'past', 'emergencies', 'were', 'actually', 'filmed', 'scene', 'events', 'happened', 'usually', 'hospitals', 'several', 'different', 'events', 'occurred', 'simultaneously.The', 'show', 'first', 'aired', '1989', 'ran', '1996', 'was', 'aired', 'sindication', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'knowledge', 'not', 'being', 'aired', 'network', 'US', 'anymore', 'why', 'really', 'hope', 'do', 'actually', 'decide', 'release', 'series', 'DVD.One', 'things', 'really', 'liked', 'Rescue', '911', 'was', 'stories', 'told', 'nearly', 'always', 'ended', 'happily', 'were', 'exceptions', 'when', 'one', 'more', 'victims', 'did', ""n't"", 'survive', 'was', 'amazed', 'people', 'show', 'survived', 'let', 'alone', 'made', 'such', 'complete', 'recoveries', 'ordeals', 'were', 'also', 'occasionally', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'incidents', 'such', 'burglar', 'who', 'attempted', 'break', 'house', 'posing', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'only', 'get', 'stuck', 'hanging', 'head', 'down', 'chimney', 'woman', 'who', 'came', 'home', 'discover', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'burglar', 'standing', 'front', 'entry', 'called', 'police', 'only', 'discover', 'was', 'maniquin', 'favorite', 'was', 'burglar', 'who', 'broke', 'store', 'only', 'become', 'trapped', 'inside', 'had', 'call', '911', 'order', 'get', 'out.One', 'other', 'things', 'always', 'found', 'most', 'memorable', 'show', 'was', 'theme', 'music', 'first', 'actually', 'scared', 'little', 'bit', 'got', 'used', 'while', 'then', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'opening', 'theme', 'sound', 'video', 'clips', 'closing', 'theme', 'memorable', 'ending', 'Mr.', 'Shapiro', 'step', 'car', 'please', 'just', 'music', 'close.So', 'again', 'really', 'do', 'hope', 'actually', 'do', 'decide', 'release', 'Rescue', '911', 'DVD', 'start', 'airing', 'sindication', 'US', 'TV', 'again', ""'ve"", 'really', 'missed', 'show']",Rescue 911 1989 TVseries

For those of you who don't remember, this is the TV series hosted by William Shattner 15 years later after the original STAR TREK TV SERIES but before BOSTON LEGAL.

Need not to worry anymore... you can watch ALL 958 episodes on YOUTUBE. Go to [...] 911.Allof the stories ARE REAL. Some of them have been reconstructed with actors playing the roles of the victums. All of the 911 phone calls are REAL the dispaters are NOT actors. The police, firemen and parametics are NOT actors. The show is a real blast and deserves to be realeased on DVD.

I remember the part where a daughter and a father go on some picnic and when they were on the road. They were driving in some red two-door car, and then a dump truck fell on them! And all the sand covered the car. The next one I remembered is when the litte girl ask her mom if she could bathe her little brother and her mom said no but she did it anyway. The little girl said she was testing to see if the water was hot or cold. She felt the cold water and decided to turn it all the way to hot! Then her little brother said it was too hot and his skin started to melt. Her mother came in the bathroom and just completely freak out. And the next thing I remember is when those kids where in the basement with their father. Their father was looking at this heater and then light up a match, and then it just EXPLODES. The two children were badly burn that they had no hair and had to wear like protection on their bodies. I'm telling you.

A darned shame it has not even been released on VHS and wonder if there is a reason. Certainly there is a market for it but if there is a valid reason why it has not been released, we viewers are not generally aware of it. That being said, My roommate and I really looked forward to watching two shows - America's Most Wanted and Rescue 9-1-1. I also enjoyed the show that either came before or after AMW, Cops, but that was too realistic for her. We were amazed at the variety of types of rescues we watched each week but it really has been too long for me to remember a single rescue. We were aware actors portrayed for the most part the ones involved and looked forward to seeing the real people at the ends of the episodes. I agree that many lives have been saved from techniques learned while watching the show and if it never gets released, at least it has that legacy. I do not remember the source, but I did read somewhere that eventually everything will be released on DVD so it could just be a long wait with a happy ending.
