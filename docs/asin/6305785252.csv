Chow,"[14, 18]","OK, we all know why you're even considering seeing a movie this B, IT STARS ELISHA CUTHBERT WHEN SHE WAS 16!!!So to calm your fears, yes yes dear Elisha yes you should buy this movie! Elisha looks great. We get to see her in a variety of outfits always laughing and smiling and doing something sexy.To understand just how low budget this movie is, it wasn't made for TV, it wasn't made for children's TV, it was made for Canadian children's TV. The plot revolves around a teen boy who is kicked out of prep school to live with his spooky old grandfather in his haunted mansion. But he's in luck because Elisha is literally the girl next door. I guess we can consider this a prelude to her performance in 'The Gild Next Door.'",5,Elisha Cuthbert Fans Will Love This Movie,1091059200,"07 29, 2004",2004,725,"['OK', 'know', 'why', ""'re"", 'even', 'considering', 'seeing', 'movie', 'B', 'IT', 'STARS', 'ELISHA', 'CUTHBERT', 'WHEN', 'SHE', 'WAS', '16', 'So', 'calm', 'fears', 'yes', 'yes', 'dear', 'Elisha', 'yes', 'should', 'buy', 'movie', 'Elisha', 'great', 'get', 'see', 'variety', 'outfits', 'always', 'laughing', 'smiling', 'doing', 'something', 'sexy.To', 'understand', 'just', 'how', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'TV', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'children', 'TV', 'was', 'made', 'Canadian', 'children', 'TV', 'plot', 'around', 'teen', 'boy', 'who', 'kicked', 'prep', 'school', 'live', 'spooky', 'old', 'grandfather', 'haunted', 'mansion', 'luck', 'Elisha', 'literally', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'guess', 'can', 'consider', 'prelude', 'performance', ""'The"", 'Gild', 'Next', 'Door']",Believe

The story is handled in a child friendly, Disneyesque fashion that would make it suitable for most children. It is sort of on the level of a ride through the ""Haunted Mansion"" attraction at Disney theme parks.The young hero, Ben Stiles, played by Ricky Mabe, is a sympathetic character who lets his boyish enthusiasm for pranks get him into trouble and kicked out of school. The story picks up in a small town in Maine where Ben's estranged grandfather lives alone in a big house which turns out to be haunted. It is up to Ben and a young girl he meets there, Katherine Winslowe, played by Elisha Cuthbert to solve the mystery of the ghostly presence.This movie is a pleasant diversion and provides an enjoyable evening's entertainment; I recommend it highly.",4,A Ghost Story with Charm,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,911,"['Believe', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'play', 'tricks', 'others', 'suddenly', 'faced', 'serious', 'situation', 'involving', 'ghost', 'who', 'help', 'story', 'handled', 'child', 'friendly', 'Disneyesque', 'fashion', 'would', 'make', 'suitable', 'most', 'children', 'sort', 'level', 'ride', 'Haunted', 'Mansion', 'attraction', 'Disney', 'theme', 'parks.The', 'young', 'hero', 'Ben', 'Stiles', 'played', 'Ricky', 'Mabe', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'who', 'boyish', 'enthusiasm', 'pranks', 'get', 'trouble', 'kicked', 'school', 'story', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'Maine', 'where', 'Ben', 'estranged', 'grandfather', 'lives', 'alone', 'big', 'house', 'out', 'be', 'haunted', 'Ben', 'young', 'girl', 'there', 'Katherine', 'Winslowe', 'played', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'solve', 'mystery', 'ghostly', 'presence.This', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'diversion', 'enjoyable', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'recommend', 'highly']",Believe

I guess that's what I get when I rent a horror movie that isn't rated R There was was nothing scary about this film at all. It mainly focused on some punk kid and his stupid pranks.They don't get to solve the mystery behind the ghost until the last 30 minutes of the film. What I also did'nt like about this movie was the kid had so much knowledge and equipment for creating pranks to scare people, that it seemed impossible. I'd like to say that there were some scenes of the movie where it was intresting, but there were'nt any! I found the whole movie very boring. I was so bored that I decided to surf the web while it was still playing .I would'nt even watch this crap if it were on television. We don't really get to see much of the real ghost. She just appears every now and then and stairs at a few people. The acting was so dumb and there were no actual effects at all.The story behind the ghost was SO stupid. I expected a lot more to it at the end, but nope. The grandfather acted like an ass and the kid was just a wuss. Overall this is one of those movies with a cool cover, but a stupid plot. Sorry to keep this review short, but I think I've already gotten my point across. Don't rent, buy, or even look at the cover of this BIG PIECE OF CRAP!

478101,A3SMH6YL9T33YS,6305785252,West Mountain,"[1, 1]","First off, the cover art on the DVD is rather misleading. If you're a hard-core horror fan, this probably won't be to your taste -- it's not a supernatural nightmare like ""The Ring"", or even a harrowing psychological thriller like ""The Turn of the Screw"".But the good news is -- it's a perfectly enjoyable film if you're looking for the suspense equivalent of the ""cozy"" type of crime novel. An earlier reviewer noted that this film may not be suitable for very young kids (under age 5) but for older children, especially tweens who aren't into graphic horror but are comfortable with playing make-believe, it may be just right. It's actually two different movies -- one is a fairly conventional tale of a ghost associated with a decades-old family secret, which as others have pointed out is a familiar pattern from Saturday-morning kids' shows. The second is about a friendship that develops between two very lonely children, which happens to take place in a Gothic type of setting.For me, the relationship story is a lot more compelling than the supernatural events, which seem a bit strained especially in the second half of the film. We learn that teenaged Katherine is grieving the recent loss of her parents, and being targeted by the town bullies to boot. She gradually opens up to Ben, who's been sent to live with his grandfather as a punishment for being expelled from boarding school. Ben may seem mild-mannered and nerdy, but he has a passion for playing elaborate practical jokes. Watching the traumatized Katherine gradually come back to life, as Ben reaches out and includes her in the preparations for a prank on her tormentors, is one of the most entertaining scenes in the film.The young leads, Elisha Cuthbert and Ricky Mabe, have since established solid careers in TV and film. Their fans may like to see this example of their early work -- both of them are onscreen for most of this movie, and even at that age were able to hold up their end in scenes with veteran actors like Jan Rubes (Ben's skeptical grandfather) and Andrea Martin (a paranormal researcher who provides some mentoring for the teens). ""Believe"" does have some entertaining moments, provided you aren't expecting something as edgy and troubling as Daniel Radcliffe's ""The Woman in Black"". It's a low-budget Canadian children's movie but I thought the filmmakers put in a good effort. It was shot around Montreal although the story takes place in New England -- I was interested to read Mark D. Clark's information about the film's budget and the production design. As of about 2010, Ricky's been working more behind the camera, hoping to direct feature films himself, so this makes the ""house haunting"" scene from ""Believe"" that much more fun to watch.",4,Children's story in a Gothic setting,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,2742,"['First', 'off', 'cover', 'art', 'DVD', 'rather', 'misleading', ""'re"", 'hard-core', 'horror', 'fan', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'taste', 'not', 'supernatural', 'nightmare', 'Ring', 'even', 'harrowing', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Turn', 'Screw', 'good', 'news', 'perfectly', 'enjoyable', 'film', ""'re"", 'looking', 'suspense', 'equivalent', 'cozy', 'type', 'crime', 'novel', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'very', 'young', 'kids', 'age', '5', 'older', 'children', 'especially', 'tweens', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'graphic', 'horror', 'are', 'comfortable', 'playing', 'make-believe', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'right', 'actually', 'two', 'different', 'movies', 'one', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'tale', 'ghost', 'associated', 'decades-old', 'family', 'secret', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'familiar', 'pattern', 'Saturday-morning', 'kids', 'shows', 'second', 'friendship', 'two', 'very', 'lonely', 'children', 'take', 'place', 'Gothic', 'type', 'setting.For', 'relationship', 'story', 'lot', 'more', 'compelling', 'supernatural', 'events', 'seem', 'bit', 'strained', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'learn', 'teenaged', 'Katherine', 'grieving', 'recent', 'loss', 'parents', 'being', 'targeted', 'town', 'bullies', 'boot', 'gradually', 'up', 'Ben', 'who', 'been', 'sent', 'live', 'grandfather', 'punishment', 'being', 'expelled', 'boarding', 'school', 'Ben', 'may', 'seem', 'mild-mannered', 'nerdy', 'passion', 'playing', 'elaborate', 'practical', 'jokes', 'Watching', 'traumatized', 'Katherine', 'gradually', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'Ben', 'out', 'preparations', 'prank', 'tormentors', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'film.The', 'young', 'leads', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'Ricky', 'Mabe', 'have', 'established', 'solid', 'careers', 'TV', 'film', 'fans', 'may', 'like', 'see', 'example', 'early', 'work', 'are', 'onscreen', 'most', 'movie', 'even', 'age', 'were', 'able', 'hold', 'up', 'end', 'scenes', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Jan', 'Rubes', 'Ben', 'skeptical', 'grandfather', 'Andrea', 'Martin', 'paranormal', 'researcher', 'who', 'mentoring', 'teens', 'Believe', 'have', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'provided', 'are', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'something', 'edgy', 'troubling', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Woman', 'Black', 'low-budget', 'Canadian', 'children', 'movie', 'thought', 'filmmakers', 'put', 'good', 'effort', 'was', 'shot', 'around', 'Montreal', 'story', 'place', 'New', 'England', 'was', 'interested', 'read', 'Mark', 'D.', 'Clark', 'information', 'film', 'budget', 'production', 'design', '2010', 'Ricky', 'been', 'working', 'more', 'camera', 'hoping', 'direct', 'feature', 'films', 'so', 'house', 'haunting', 'scene', 'Believe', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'watch']",Believe
478102,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,6305785252,Z Hayes,"[3, 3]","""Believe"" is the perfect family-friendly Halloween watch. It has clean language, credible acting, and enough atmosphere and suspense to keep viewers (primarily tweens) engaged. The story centers on teenager Benjamin Stiles (Ricky Mabe) who keeps getting kicked out of each private school his parents enroll him in. His parents are absentee parents, traveling the world while Ben is stuck in boarding schools, feeling unwanted and lonely. When Ben is kicked out of his current school, his parents decide to send him to live with his grandfather, Jason Stiles (Jan Rubes), a man Ben has not seen since he was five years old, and who is estranged from Ben's dad.When Ben gets to the large Stiles estate, he finds his grandfather polite but aloof, and soon begins to see a strange woman appearing around the estate, dressed in a red coat. Ben's queries are met with disapproval and silence on the part of his grandfather, and everyone seems to behave as though nothing is amiss. It is only after Ben meets another teen, Katharine (Elisha Cuthbert) that he realizes he has not been imagining things. Katharine Winslowe also sees the ghost, and the pair try to solve the mystery of the haunting, discovering long-hidden family secrets and a tragedy that has resulted in the estrangement between two families.I thought the story was generally well-paced (except for one story arc about getting even with the town bullies that seemed very childish to me). Other than that, the story itself is interesting, and as I mentioned, this is a movie suited more for the tween set, and can also be enjoyed as a family.",4,"Family-friendly supernatural-themed movie, great for tweens",1288224000,"10 28, 2010",2010,1601,"['Believe', 'perfect', 'family-friendly', 'Halloween', 'watch', 'clean', 'language', 'credible', 'acting', 'enough', 'atmosphere', 'suspense', 'keep', 'viewers', 'primarily', 'engaged', 'story', 'centers', 'teenager', 'Benjamin', 'Stiles', 'Ricky', 'Mabe', 'who', 'getting', 'kicked', 'private', 'school', 'parents', 'enroll', 'parents', 'are', 'absentee', 'parents', 'traveling', 'world', 'Ben', 'stuck', 'boarding', 'schools', 'feeling', 'unwanted', 'lonely', 'When', 'Ben', 'kicked', 'current', 'school', 'parents', 'decide', 'send', 'live', 'grandfather', 'Jason', 'Stiles', 'Jan', 'Rubes', 'man', 'Ben', 'not', 'seen', 'was', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'who', 'estranged', 'Ben', 'dad.When', 'Ben', 'large', 'Stiles', 'estate', 'grandfather', 'polite', 'aloof', 'soon', 'begins', 'see', 'strange', 'woman', 'appearing', 'estate', 'dressed', 'red', 'coat', 'Ben', 'queries', 'are', 'met', 'disapproval', 'silence', 'part', 'grandfather', 'everyone', 'behave', 'nothing', 'amiss', 'only', 'Ben', 'teen', 'Katharine', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'not', 'been', 'imagining', 'things', 'Katharine', 'Winslowe', 'also', 'ghost', 'pair', 'try', 'solve', 'mystery', 'haunting', 'discovering', 'long-hidden', 'family', 'secrets', 'tragedy', 'resulted', 'estrangement', 'two', 'families.I', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'generally', 'well-paced', 'one', 'story', 'arc', 'getting', 'even', 'town', 'bullies', 'seemed', 'very', 'childish', 'Other', 'story', 'interesting', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'suited', 'more', 'tween', 'set', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'family']",Believe
