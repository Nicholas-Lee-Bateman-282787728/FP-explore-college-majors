I rented this. I would recommend renting it rather than buying because it wasn't a movie I would watch over again. I rented it because I like &#34;Sanford and Son&#34; a lot and I wanted to see a movie with Redd Foxx.,3,"Redd Foxx in ""Norman...

I think this movie was very well done. It may not be a perfect movie.

Good cast all the way around, and I liked Dennis Dugan very much in his roll as Garrison Hobart, Pearl Bailey and Redd Foxx are great, and Wayland Flowers (w/Madame) as Larry Davenport was the hit of the film. I laughed through the film like a fool, as did the rest of the folks in the theater.  Dennis Dugan didn't do a lot of on screen acting, but he sure works behind the camera directing many, many productions since then. I was 24 or 25 at the time, just comming out of the closet, and so I saw any and everything at the time that had gay characters in it. Some film did a good job of showing gay folks as just folks, more did not.

144565,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,0792839951,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[17, 18]","Norman Is That You is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE movies.  I have no IDEA at all what planet the people who wrote the negative reviews are on!  What makes a great movie are the expected things like its message, plot, comedy and other production values placed in context of society at the time it was made.We are talking about a gay themed movie here.  A mostly positive gay themed movie that does not have all the gay characters dying as the credits roll.  I lived as a high school aged gay black kid in the 1970's and I remember how many black gay themed movies there were in the movies before Norman Is That You back then.  There were NO GAY BLACK MALE themed movies with even a tepid positive spin on coming out as a gay man in the black community.Even today 25 years later, the black community in general still has far too many hang ups about helping its gay members of all ages deal with issues of coming out and living openly as accepted valued parts of their culture.  As a man today who was a gay youth when Norman Is That You was produced, I thank God for this funny, yet touching movie.  While a little over the top Pearl Bailey and Redd Foxx were somewhat accurate depictions of the way a black family handles a gay son who is coming out.  From personal experience coming out as gay in a black family was indeed part pain, part funny and part intense questioning and introspection on all sides.Norman is that You honors black people and our culture while teaching lessons about coming to accept love and support gay family members in fun ways.  Granted the ending of Norman Is That You wimps out by not really resolving the gay plot line in a believable or fulfilling way but you must remember the repressed times for gays the 1970's were.  People who are so fast to trash Norman Is That You, must look at the fact that since its release, there has not been a subsequent DVD or movie that dealt this directly and intimately with gay coming out issues from a uniquely black perspective.To have released a movie that spoke this directly to issues of gay black coming out at a time when the struggle for Gay Rights was in its infancy was a gutsy move few of these reviewers seem able to fully appriciate.  Norman Is That You is NOT perfect, Norman Is That You confronts the black gay coming out issues in a very tepid way by todays standards but, back in the day when black gay kids coming out had no place to turn Norman Is That You was THE MOST AFFIRMING REFUGE A GAY BLACK 1970'S ERA KID COMING OUT HAD AND IT'S WHY, NORMAN IS THAT YOU? WILL ALWAYS ROCK!I pray Norman Is That You comes out on DVD!  This is fine acting by a largely black cast which brings out the bigot in some lesser members of society.
