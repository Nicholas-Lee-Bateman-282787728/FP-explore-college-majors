Honestly he is purely Fleetwood Mac !His two individual albums employing those musicians who are just affecting his image and reputationand those hits in these two albums they played are mediocre due to their musical ability and talent.Most of the songs are either sounding with no punch on bass or drums and percussion were too weak.Lindsey should have arranged a better competent team to play with him. He must shine on again !,2,Audiophile Viewer,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,487,"['love', 'Lindsey', 'have', 'collections', '1985', 'Honestly', 'purely', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'two', 'individual', 'albums', 'employing', 'musicians', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'affecting', 'image', 'reputationand', 'hits', 'two', 'albums', 'played', 'are', 'mediocre', 'due', 'musical', 'ability', 'talent.Most', 'songs', 'are', 'sounding', 'punch', 'bass', 'drums', 'percussion', 'were', 'too', 'weak.Lindsey', 'should', 'have', 'arranged', 'better', 'competent', 'team', 'play', 'must', 'shine', 'again']",N/A

1494263,AU5P1L2LLVO12,B005M26YVA,kev,"[0, 0]","Wow! Lindsey delivers a nuanced, intense, and impressive set of classic Fleetwood Mac and solo tunes in this iteration of the 'small machine.' When it comes to underrated guitar players, Lindsey defines the list. He is an introverted guy, but this makes his talent all the more delectable when you get a taste of it.I recently had the pleasure of seeing Lindsey solo in a club of about 1000 people. That tour did not feature any back-up, while this blu-ray features Lindsey solo on the first few and last songs, but with his band on the majority of the set. The band doesn't really add anything, so I wish this show was entirely solo (although Tusk is great). The truly electric moments are when you realize the true lead guitar genius behind the Mac's catalog when Lindsey is alone on stage displaying his classic finger-picking style. &#34;Never Going Back Again&#34; is rendered in a searing, half-whispered slow-burn that leaves you hanging on the next note.Picture and audio quality are both top-notch, so if you are a fan of Lindsey's, don't hesitate to pick this up.",5,Lindsey Sowing His Seeds,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,1073,"['Wow', 'Lindsey', 'nuanced', 'intense', 'impressive', 'set', 'classic', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'solo', 'tunes', 'iteration', ""'small"", 'machine', 'When', 'underrated', 'guitar', 'players', 'Lindsey', 'list', 'introverted', 'guy', 'talent', 'more', 'delectable', 'when', 'get', 'taste', 'it.I', 'recently', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'Lindsey', 'solo', 'club', '1000', 'people', 'tour', 'did', 'not', 'feature', 'back-up', 'blu-ray', 'features', 'Lindsey', 'solo', 'first', 'few', 'last', 'songs', 'band', 'majority', 'set', 'band', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'wish', 'show', 'was', 'entirely', 'solo', 'Tusk', 'great', 'truly', 'electric', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'realize', 'true', 'lead', 'guitar', 'genius', 'Mac', 'catalog', 'when', 'Lindsey', 'alone', 'stage', 'displaying', 'classic', 'finger-picking', 'style', '34', 'Never', 'Going', 'Back', 'Again', '34', 'rendered', 'searing', 'half-whispered', 'slow-burn', 'hanging', 'next', 'note.Picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'are', 'top-notch', 'so', 'are', 'fan', 'Lindsey', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'pick', 'up']",N/A
1494264,AFPR2BY85DFAD,B005M26YVA,Long Time Home Theater Guy,"[9, 9]","With Fleetwood Mac as my number one musical group and ""Go Your Own Way"" as one of my two all time favorite songs, I've greatly anticipated the arrival today of this Blu-ray when it was announced back in September.  Having attended many of their live concert performances and owning a multitude of the group or individual member's performances on LP's, CD's, Laserdisc, DVD and now Blu-ray through the decades, I am quite familiar with Lindsey's musical contributions.Recorded at the Saban Theater in Beverly Hills, CA, this is a wonderfully intimate theater of 1900 seats offers the perfect venue for what is a solo performance by Lindsey for 1/3 of the set (6 songs out of the 19 total) running  1 hour 47 minutes.  Sonically, it is Lindsey and his variety of guitars at their peak both in performance and recording.  5.1 DTS HD Master lossless audio without compression is on full display during his solo performances with a sample of the available dynamic range on ""Never Going Back Again.""  Lindsey's vocals and his guitar plucks & twangs are solidly spread across the front soundstage with the surrounds limited to immersing the listener among the concert attendees who's every comment can be heard loud and very clear.  As the 3 members of his band contributes their talents starting with the 6th track of ""Under the Skin"", the surround channels fill with the added vocals and instrumentals expanding the already spectacular sound stage to totally encompass the listener.Visually, the dynamic range here is every bit as broad as the sound going from the Blackest Black backgrounds during each of Lindsey's solo performances to the absolute peak Whites when the high intensity stage lights are aimed directly into the camera's lens.  The latter causes some slight banding that is understandable due to the lighting conditions involved but certainly doesn't take away from the overall quality of the high definition recording.  Again due to the artistic choices made for the stage lighting, wide shots from the balcony are more limited in detail than what many might be accustomed to on other recordings.  Go in tight and the available video resolution is all on display best evidenced on the song ""I'm So Afraid"" where you cannot only see the beads of sweat back lit, dripping off Lindsey's forehead but individual specks of dust floating in the air on stage as well.  Close ups on his fingers at work (Lindsey's guitar skills fully on display in tight close ups also on ""I'm So Afraid"") on the strings clearly reveal the many years of wear and tear on the necks of his guitars with swirl marks and microscopic scratches catching the spot lights clearly visible on a number of his many different guitar bodies.As familiar as I am with Lindsey's performances of many of his past songs, the new interpretations here are very nicely done and different enough to sound fresh again.  Add in some of the new songs from his latest ""Seeds We Sow"" CD that I found remarkably commercial (End of Time, In Our Own Time) along with views from the best seats in the house that allowed me to watch Lindsey's skill with a guitar up close and personal, this Blu-ray concert is a must own for any of his (or Fleetwood Mac) fans.  For others who are simply looking for that great sounding demo disc to show off their home theater system, this audio mix by Lindsey Buckingham & Neal Heywood will impress with its clarity, dynamic range and ability to reveal what a single gifted singer backed only by his guitar is able to produce.",5,The Small Machine is BIG on Sound,1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,3516,"['Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'number', 'one', 'musical', 'group', 'Go', 'Own', 'Way', 'one', 'two', 'time', 'favorite', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'greatly', 'anticipated', 'arrival', 'today', 'Blu-ray', 'when', 'was', 'announced', 'back', 'September', 'Having', 'attended', 'many', 'live', 'concert', 'performances', 'owning', 'multitude', 'group', 'individual', 'member', 'performances', 'LP', 'CD', 'Laserdisc', 'DVD', 'now', 'Blu-ray', 'decades', 'am', 'quite', 'familiar', 'Lindsey', 'musical', 'contributions.Recorded', 'Saban', 'Theater', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'CA', 'wonderfully', 'intimate', 'theater', '1900', 'seats', 'perfect', 'venue', 'what', 'solo', 'performance', 'Lindsey', '1/3', 'set', '6', 'songs', '19', 'total', 'running', '1', 'hour', '47', 'minutes', 'Sonically', 'Lindsey', 'variety', 'guitars', 'peak', 'performance', 'recording', '5.1', 'DTS', 'HD', 'Master', 'lossless', 'audio', 'compression', 'full', 'display', 'solo', 'performances', 'sample', 'available', 'dynamic', 'range', 'Never', 'Going', 'Back', 'Again', 'Lindsey', 'vocals', 'guitar', 'plucks', 'twangs', 'are', 'solidly', 'spread', 'front', 'soundstage', 'surrounds', 'limited', 'immersing', 'listener', 'concert', 'attendees', 'who', 'comment', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'loud', 'very', 'clear', '3', 'members', 'band', 'talents', 'starting', '6th', 'track', 'Skin', 'surround', 'channels', 'fill', 'added', 'vocals', 'instrumentals', 'expanding', 'already', 'spectacular', 'sound', 'stage', 'totally', 'encompass', 'listener.Visually', 'dynamic', 'range', 'here', 'bit', 'as', 'broad', 'sound', 'going', 'Blackest', 'Black', 'Lindsey', 'solo', 'performances', 'absolute', 'peak', 'Whites', 'when', 'high', 'intensity', 'stage', 'lights', 'are', 'aimed', 'directly', 'camera', 'lens', 'latter', 'slight', 'banding', 'understandable', 'due', 'lighting', 'conditions', 'involved', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'quality', 'high', 'definition', 'recording', 'Again', 'due', 'artistic', 'choices', 'made', 'stage', 'lighting', 'wide', 'shots', 'balcony', 'are', 'more', 'limited', 'detail', 'what', 'many', 'might', 'be', 'accustomed', 'other', 'recordings', 'Go', 'tight', 'available', 'video', 'resolution', 'display', 'best', 'evidenced', 'song', ""'m"", 'So', 'Afraid', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'beads', 'sweat', 'back', 'lit', 'dripping', 'off', 'Lindsey', 'forehead', 'individual', 'specks', 'dust', 'floating', 'air', 'stage', 'as', 'well', 'Close', 'ups', 'fingers', 'work', 'Lindsey', 'guitar', 'skills', 'fully', 'display', 'tight', 'close', 'ups', 'also', ""'m"", 'So', 'Afraid', 'strings', 'clearly', 'reveal', 'many', 'years', 'wear', 'tear', 'necks', 'guitars', 'swirl', 'marks', 'microscopic', 'scratches', 'catching', 'spot', 'clearly', 'visible', 'number', 'many', 'different', 'guitar', 'bodies.As', 'familiar', 'am', 'Lindsey', 'performances', 'many', 'past', 'songs', 'new', 'interpretations', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'different', 'enough', 'sound', 'fresh', 'again', 'Add', 'new', 'songs', 'latest', 'Seeds', 'Sow', 'CD', 'found', 'remarkably', 'commercial', 'End', 'Time', 'Own', 'Time', 'views', 'best', 'seats', 'house', 'allowed', 'watch', 'Lindsey', 'skill', 'guitar', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'Blu-ray', 'concert', 'must', 'own', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'fans', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'simply', 'looking', 'great', 'sounding', 'demo', 'disc', 'show', 'off', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'audio', 'mix', 'Lindsey', 'Buckingham', 'Neal', 'Heywood', 'will', 'impress', 'clarity', 'dynamic', 'range', 'ability', 'reveal', 'what', 'single', 'gifted', 'singer', 'backed', 'only', 'guitar', 'able', 'produce']",N/A
1494265,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005M26YVA,M. Oleson,"[3, 3]","As Buckingham explains between a couple songs, the Large Machine is Fleetwood Mac and all the commerce and wealth that came with it.  The Small Machine is just him.  And he does several songs solo, but he also has 3 additional musicians join him for the meat of the program, so I'm not sure if that becomes the Medium Machine or whether they are just oil for the machine.  In any case the machine is in fine working order.  Having been in the audience a few years ago when Buckingham performed a concert at Bass Hall in Fort Worth, I can attest to his connection with the audience. That show became his last DVD concert.  I noticed some similarities here.  He opens and closes solo.  He doesn't shy away from the greats (""Go Insane"", ""Trouble"", ""Tusk"", ""I'm So Afraid"") which makes the audience increase the pitch to a feverish state.  The best one of all is his Chet Atkins Gibson (isn't HD great) guitar shredding on ""Big Love"" which brings the house down.  This time around Buckingham plays numerous tracks from his newest studio album ""Seeds We Sow"" which is a mixture of up tempo and slower songs with his back up musicians also vocalizing.  At times I thought I was listening to ""America.""Lindsey Buckingham writes some great songs and has an excellent, identifiable voice.  His greatest gift however, may be his guitar playing.  Changing guitars with every song, he rarely (saw maybe once) uses a pick and he doesn't have those long pointy fingernails.  He uses his finger tips for the most part and he's masterful.  The DTS-HD Master audio is spectacular as you might expect as are the visuals.  Thankfully the director moves the cameras slowly and purposefully with most of the focus on the musicians and their instruments.
