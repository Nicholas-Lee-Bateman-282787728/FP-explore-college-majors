Like the fact that they go through popular Christmas songs that kids should know, and that the words are displayed at the bottom of the screen in a sing-a-long so they can follow along. And the scenes are taken from popular Disney classics so kids can watch the clips along with the music video. BUT the whole set-up of this DVD is very cheesy, not executed very well.

This program featured Christmas songs with scenes from Disney cartoons on screen along with the words, often highlighted by a Mickey Mouse head. It lasted 30 minutes and had the following songs- Deck The Halls, Up On The Housetop, Joy To The World, Let It Snow, Sleigh Ride, Winter Wonderland, Here Comes Santa Claus (At Disneyland), Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, Jingle Bells, Silent Night and We Wish You A Merry Christmas.In 2002, Disney released Disney's Sing Along Songs: Very Merry Christmas Songs on DVD. Unlike what the ... Editorial Review states, this version lasts 54 minutes, and not just 30 minutes. This new DVD edition features the same songs from the VHS version, along with some additions. These include- a new version of Jingle Bells, Toyland, All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth, The Best Christmas Of All, White Christmas, Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree, Jingle Bell Rock, As Long As There's A Christmas and Seasons Of Giving.This program on DVD is just great for the children just as it was on VHS so I do recommend it.

However, if you don't compare the two, this DVD is very enjoyable. It lists on the back cover which songs are new to this version, and you'll be able to tell by the difference in animation. I love the classics best, but there's nothing wrong with the new cartoons. Many of the new cartoons come from Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas, Winnie the Pooh and one from Belle's Enchanted Christmas. My princess loving 3 yr old was glad for Belle's song.The narrator has been described as scary or creepy, but I disagree. It's actually the same narrator as the one in Babe. He reminds me of the classic Pooh narrators. I understand the reaction of those who hate the changes because they loved the old one so much. I hate it when they mess with things I loved too. But for everyone who has not seen the VHS version, there is no reason to not like this version!  All the old Disney cartoons are here, although I don't know if the singing is the same. But the singing was fine. The end song looks like it's from the House of Mouse cartoon. My nieces were glad to see all the Disney characters together in that one.There are only 2 religious songs if you're concerned about that. My nieces are Jewish so we just fast forward through the two Christian songs. But I'm glad they were included as I will love watching them with my own kids.
