581426,A34DXWXAQPWQ5G,B00005BJOE,"astrology hound ""&#34;Adrian&#34;""","[0, 0]","I just saw this video for the first time in a megastore.  I watched it exactly three times, trying to get some sense of what the point is.  Perhaps this video is the best case against nepotism--should Madonna have hired her husband just because he's a filmmaker?  Can one assume that a filmmaker can create a compelling video just because they make movies?  Mostly I feel that this was a missed opportunity.  The album cut of the song has more dramatic tension and authentic sadness that the mix that is in this video.  The techno version should have been included as an alternative mix for clubs.  This could have been one of Madonna's best, most &quot;cinematic&quot; videos since &quot;Papa Don't Preach.&quot;  I don't always love ALL of Madonna's music, but she is one of the strongest artists of the video medium--and I think, for this particular album--&quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; is a tour-de-force of writing and singing.  So why not a video with a story or at least something coherent?  The men in the video weren't interesting to look at AT ALL, regardless of whether they were being victimized, and I wasn't crazy about Madonna's hair being in her face the whole time.  If she was trying to make a point about older women and anger--perhaps she succeeded, but I found myself mostly feeling sad for the old woman playing this role.  It might have been nice to see the woman who speaks the part at the beginning of the song.  It's called--What it feels like for a girl, and yet Madonna is the only &quot;girl&quot; in the video, at 42.  Where are the teen-age girls that she's singing about? I don't think this song needed a literal interpretation, but Guy Ritchie's concept of Madonna as reckless bandit isn't fully realized.  I didn't take any vicarious joy watching her rob people or hit them with cars.  We didn't get the set up as to why this particular woman was pushed to the breaking point.  Unless the numbers on the door (666) are meant to suggest demonic possession? Is that what it feels like for a girl?Madonna can be brilliant at times when focused, but this is the provacateur Madonna without intelligence--the Madonna who loves to shock....the Madonna of the misguided SEX book.  If that's enough, and as usual, in our culture of mediocrity it often is...then enjoy.  But I feel it's too bad....the song itself is very honest, perhaps even revolutionary, and the video might have been a classic.",2,What it feels like for a fan,991180800,"05 30, 2001",2001,2435,"['just', 'saw', 'video', 'first', 'time', 'megastore', 'watched', 'exactly', 'three', 'times', 'trying', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'point', 'Perhaps', 'video', 'best', 'case', 'nepotism', 'should', 'Madonna', 'have', 'hired', 'husband', 'just', 'filmmaker', 'Can', 'one', 'assume', 'filmmaker', 'can', 'create', 'compelling', 'video', 'just', 'make', 'movies', 'Mostly', 'feel', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'album', 'cut', 'song', 'more', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'authentic', 'sadness', 'mix', 'video', 'techno', 'version', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'alternative', 'mix', 'clubs', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'Madonna', 'best', 'most', 'quot', 'cinematic', 'quot', 'videos', 'quot', 'Papa', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Preach.', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'love', 'ALL', 'Madonna', 'music', 'one', 'strongest', 'artists', 'video', 'medium', 'think', 'particular', 'album', 'quot', 'What', 'A', 'Girl', 'quot', 'tour-de-force', 'writing', 'singing', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'video', 'story', 'least', 'something', 'coherent', 'men', 'video', 'were', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'look', 'AT', 'ALL', 'regardless', 'were', 'being', 'victimized', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'Madonna', 'hair', 'being', 'face', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'older', 'women', 'anger', 'perhaps', 'succeeded', 'found', 'mostly', 'feeling', 'sad', 'old', 'woman', 'playing', 'role', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'woman', 'who', 'part', 'beginning', 'song', 'called', 'What', 'girl', 'yet', 'Madonna', 'only', 'quot', 'quot', 'video', '42', 'Where', 'are', 'teen-age', 'girls', 'singing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'song', 'needed', 'literal', 'interpretation', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'concept', 'Madonna', 'reckless', 'bandit', ""n't"", 'fully', 'realized', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'vicarious', 'joy', 'watching', 'rob', 'people', 'hit', 'cars', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'set', 'up', 'why', 'particular', 'woman', 'was', 'pushed', 'breaking', 'point', 'numbers', 'door', '666', 'are', 'meant', 'suggest', 'demonic', 'possession', 'what', 'girl', 'Madonna', 'can', 'be', 'brilliant', 'times', 'when', 'focused', 'provacateur', 'Madonna', 'intelligence', 'Madonna', 'who', 'shock', '.the', 'Madonna', 'misguided', 'SEX', 'book', 'enough', 'usual', 'culture', 'mediocrity', 'often', 'then', 'enjoy', 'feel', 'too', 'bad', '.the', 'song', 'very', 'honest', 'perhaps', 'even', 'revolutionary', 'video', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'classic']",N/A
581427,AE42JLYPXUI45,B00005BJOE,"Chad DeFeo ""(ChandlerBingFan)""","[5, 8]","Madonna has always been known to shock the world with her dazzling music videos and live performances. WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL is not the first video to be banned by MTV and VH1. Back in 1990, the music video for the controversial JUSTIFY MY LOVE was banned by MTV and VH1 and was the first music video to be released on VHS as a video single.WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL, the third and final single to be released from her MUSIC (2000) album, is directed by Madonna's husband Guy Ritchie. This is a video that shows us a side of Madonna that none of us have ever seen before: it's violent. Although the album version may be a moving ballad with uplifting vocals and lyrics, Madonna wanted to get the song's message out to the people by making the video to what is here. Madonna had said that, ""...It shows my character acting out of fantasy and doing things that girls are not allowed to do. This is an angry song and I wanted a matching visual with an edgy dance mix"". Madonna had also said that she indeed hopes that the video will get people talking and open dialogue and she succeeded. The hypocrites have given Madonna and this video a bad name. I, as the rest of my fellow Madonna fans, on the other hand have thought this video was a great step for Madonna. Madonna has also been known to change her look, sound of music, outfits, and style of performances for many years and making this video to what it is was one of the many great ways of showing that.The video starts off with Madonna sitting in a motel room in a navy-blue jumpsuit. She puts on one earring that reads LADY. She grabs her suitcase and leaves the room and gets into her car where the front license plate reads PUSSY and the back reads CAT. You put the two words together and you get PUSSYCAT. At this exact moment, Madonna's elderly grandmother is sitting in a nursing home. Madonna hot-wires the car and drives off to the nursing home to pick up her grandmother. The name of the nursing home reads OLE KUNTZ' HOME. She puts her grandmother in the car and the two go off on their crime spree. While stopped at a red light, Madonna looks to her right and notices four hoodlums in the car next to her. She makes a wide U-turn and rams the hoodlums' car. She drives on to a MAC machine, takes out her stun gun and uses it on the man at the machine. She walks off with his money, a load of it I might add, and drives to a fast-food joint where she buys a bag of fries and two drinks where she then squirts water into two cops' faces. Then she's off to ram a couple of hockey players on roller skates, leading to Madonna throwing away the remaining bag of fries. She stops at a gas station where she and her grandmother ditch their car and get into a new one, a car that is actually being filled with gas by its owner. The minute the two drive off, the grandmother is back in the nursing home who spent the last 3 or 4 minutes imagining this whole fantasy. Madonna is back in her motel room picking out alias. She grabs her suitcase and heads out the door. The room number is 669, but when she slams the door, she slams it hard enough to make the 9 flip into a 6, making the room number change from 669 to 666, where the video ends with Madonna crashing the stolen car into a pole.Violent, but so what? There are many other things on T.V. that are much more violent than a music video, but that only goes to show you that these hypocrites are always out to bring Madonna down and after 21 years, they still haven't learned that they cannot bring her down. They all know that Madonna is the Queen Diva and with a video like this, she will be the Queen Diva for eternity and beyond.

581437,A35U2FY3ZWLGDH,B00005BJOE,"Jerrod Maruyama ""mediaboy""","[1, 1]","Few would argue that Madonna is a pioneering force in the world of the music video.  Countless times in her spectacular career she has re-defined the video format.  Like she herself has said before, each video is like a little movie, vignettes that have truly defined Madonna as artist.  Even her most successful film role to date (Evita) was nothing more than an extended music video.  So, along comes &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; the video.  Not since 1990's &quot;Justify My Love&quot; has Madonna recieved such controversy over a video.  Then, it seemed outrageous that MTV would ban such a high profile video from an artist that helped create and define the channel.  MTV took a similar but less controversial stance with 1992's &quot;Erotica&quot; video, showing the clip only after midnight with a spoken warning/introduction.  Now in the age of Eminem and Columbine MTV's ban of this kind-of-violent clip seems less a precaution and more a promotion.  Madonna has said that this is an angry song with an angry video to match.  Most reviews of the album cited &quot;WIFLFAG&quot; as a standout track, calling it Madonna's heart-felt advice to the likes of Britney and Christina.  The anger seemes to have gone unnoticed.  The video, set to a dance remix of the original song, depicts Madonna as a girl on a rampage.  It's an over the top revenge fantasy with the material mom in full diva mode.  While the clip, like most Madonna videos, deals with role reversals and a shifting concept of sexual identity, her tongue seems less planted in her cheek.  Gone is the irony of &quot;Express Yourself&quot; and &quot;Music&quot;.  Gone is the bitter-sweet romanticism of &quot;Bad Girl&quot; and &quot;Take A Bow&quot;.  While the video is quite cinematic in its imagery (it was, afterall, directed by her film maker hubby Guy Ritchie) it lacks the poetry and elegance of her best work (see &quot;Bad Girl&quot; and &quot;Oh Father&quot;).  Though poetry and elegance may not have been the goal for either Mr. or Mrs. Madonna, the video still falls a little flat despite its grittiness and Wile E. Coyote violence.  Edited with a frantic pace, the clip seems panicked to squeeze in as many... ...scenes as possible.  Visually at odds with the  inherent sweetness of the song (perhaps that's why a remix sans lyrics was used), the video achieves a  kind of &quot;You-Go-Girl&quot; punch but lacks the lasting charm of some of her earlier works.  But does all this really matter?  Of course not.  Since entering our public consciousness in the early eighties, few of us have been able to look away.  I, for one, welcome her shenanigans and watch with complete fascination.  Madonna conitnues to challenge us after all these years and that alone is amazing.  This video (along with &quot;Music&quot; her latest #1 single and disc, and the long-awaited &quot;Drowned World Tour&quot; this summer) is Madonna merely tapping the shoulder of the public to say &quot;I'm still here&quot; forcing us to realize she never left.Oh, and by the way, she looks great!The DVD contains two bonus audio tracks including the remix used in the video and is available only on this DVD.",3,Violent Femme,988070400,"04 24, 2001",2001,3180,"['Few', 'would', 'argue', 'Madonna', 'pioneering', 'force', 'world', 'music', 'video', 'Countless', 'times', 'spectacular', 'career', 're-defined', 'video', 'format', 'said', 'video', 'little', 'movie', 'have', 'truly', 'defined', 'Madonna', 'artist', 'Even', 'most', 'successful', 'film', 'role', 'date', 'Evita', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'extended', 'music', 'video', 'So', 'quot', 'What', 'A', 'Girl', 'quot', 'video', 'Not', '1990', 'quot', 'Justify', 'My', 'Love', 'quot', 'Madonna', 'recieved', 'such', 'controversy', 'video', 'Then', 'seemed', 'outrageous', 'MTV', 'would', 'ban', 'high', 'profile', 'video', 'artist', 'helped', 'create', 'define', 'channel', 'MTV', 'took', 'similar', 'less', 'controversial', 'stance', '1992', 'quot', 'Erotica', 'quot', 'video', 'showing', 'clip', 'only', 'midnight', 'spoken', 'warning/introduction', 'Now', 'age', 'Eminem', 'Columbine', 'MTV', 'ban', 'kind-of-violent', 'clip', 'less', 'precaution', 'more', 'promotion', 'Madonna', 'said', 'angry', 'song', 'angry', 'video', 'match', 'Most', 'reviews', 'album', 'cited', 'quot', 'WIFLFAG', 'quot', 'standout', 'track', 'calling', 'Madonna', 'heart-felt', 'advice', 'likes', 'Britney', 'Christina', 'anger', 'have', 'gone', 'unnoticed', 'video', 'set', 'dance', 'remix', 'original', 'song', 'Madonna', 'girl', 'rampage', 'top', 'revenge', 'fantasy', 'material', 'mom', 'full', 'diva', 'mode', 'clip', 'most', 'Madonna', 'videos', 'deals', 'role', 'reversals', 'shifting', 'concept', 'sexual', 'identity', 'tongue', 'less', 'planted', 'cheek', 'Gone', 'irony', 'quot', 'Express', 'Yourself', 'quot', 'quot', 'Music', 'quot', 'Gone', 'bitter-sweet', 'romanticism', 'quot', 'Bad', 'Girl', 'quot', 'quot', 'Take', 'A', 'Bow', 'quot', 'video', 'quite', 'cinematic', 'imagery', 'was', 'afterall', 'directed', 'film', 'maker', 'hubby', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'poetry', 'elegance', 'best', 'work', 'see', 'quot', 'Bad', 'Girl', 'quot', 'quot', 'Oh', 'Father', 'quot', 'poetry', 'elegance', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'goal', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Madonna', 'video', 'still', 'little', 'flat', 'grittiness', 'Wile', 'E.', 'Coyote', 'violence', 'Edited', 'frantic', 'pace', 'clip', 'panicked', 'squeeze', 'as', 'many', 'scenes', 'possible', 'Visually', 'odds', 'inherent', 'sweetness', 'song', 'perhaps', 'why', 'remix', 'sans', 'lyrics', 'was', 'used', 'video', 'kind', 'quot', 'You-Go-Girl', 'quot', 'punch', 'lasting', 'charm', 'earlier', 'works', 'really', 'matter', 'course', 'not', 'entering', 'public', 'consciousness', 'early', 'eighties', 'few', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'look', 'away', 'one', 'shenanigans', 'watch', 'complete', 'fascination', 'Madonna', 'challenge', 'years', 'alone', 'amazing', 'video', 'quot', 'Music', 'quot', 'latest', '1', 'single', 'disc', 'long-awaited', 'quot', 'Drowned', 'World', 'Tour', 'quot', 'summer', 'Madonna', 'merely', 'tapping', 'shoulder', 'public', 'say', 'quot', ""'m"", 'still', 'here', 'quot', 'forcing', 'realize', 'never', 'left.Oh', 'way', 'great', 'DVD', 'two', 'bonus', 'audio', 'tracks', 'including', 'remix', 'used', 'video', 'available', 'only', 'DVD']",N/A

When people complained that the 'Music' DVD contained only two video versions of the song and no audio versions at all, I had to agree that it was criminal to not use so much available DVD space. Even more stunning is the revelation that this DVD contains only one version of the song - the banned video that everyone has already recorded off VH1 and MTV the night they aired it.As a novel Madonna video, this is a rather nice one and makes for compelling watching, though it doesn't add up to much (most people I know would say the same of Madonna herself). As a longtime Madonna fan, this is not a purchase that I would make instantly, if I were you. Madonna has taken one of the best tracks off the album, killed it with a remix, and set it to a hardly violent video. Honestly, if you've watched it, you will have realized how tame it is in comparison to MTV's 'Jackass'. Shouldn't people be spending their time banning something else?Its no secret that this track, once so promising, has become Madonna's biggest single blunder since the release of 'Music'.

What It Feels Like For A Girl was MADONNA's first video to be banned in almost 10 years. When the video came out it caused so much controversey, but the fact is it was not as bad as many made it out to be. The video starts out with MADONNA picking up her grandma at the &quot;Old Kuntz Home&quot;, on the way to there destination MADONNA's character meets up with some young guys at a stop light who blow her a kiss, this upsets MADONNA and she takes off on the red light does a U-Turn in the middle of the street and rams right in to the side of their car. She also uses a stun-gun on this guy at the atm and takes his money. While leaving from a fast food Drive In, she sees these policemen and just happens to side swipe their police car than backs up and pulls out a gun and squirts them with water. She then takes off and the police get in their car and just as they take off she backs right in to them and there airbags blow up on them. She then decides to plow through a bunch of Hockey players and manages to hit one and causes him to fly over her car. Just when you think things have calmed down MADONNA stops at a gas station and decides to steal the guys red Firebird while he is puttung gas. She leaves her yellow camaro and sneeks her grandma in the passengers side while the guy has his music blasting and is putting gas. MADONNA than gets n the car and takes off with the guy chaseing her. She does another U-turn and plows right in to the guy and he flys right over the top even worse than the hockey player earlier. While all this is happening the gas hose is still releasing gas. She then runs in to the gas pump and pulls out her lighter then lights it and throws it out on the spilled gas and BANG the place explodes with her barely escaping the explosion. She then speeds like a maniac and ends up wraping the red firebird around a pole which many believe to be her character comming suicide in the video.

581446,AZAEN52HOZA7T,B00005BJOE,"Reka Kovacs ""Madonna""","[2, 2]","What It Feels Like For A Girl is from Madonna's Music CD. It is the 3rd single of off her album. It was directed by her husband Guy Ritchie. It was banned on MTV and VH1 due to violence. I really don't understand why I have seen worse videos depicting violence. This is her 3rd banned video. The video starts off with Madonna putting her clothes in a suitcase and then getting into her yellow sports car and going to an old convelescant home to pick up her grandmother. Day turns to night and she is driving around town with her grandmother. A group of guys in a car are checking her out, she winks at them and then she turns around and hits them with full force. She then sees a guy at a ATM machine and uses a stun gun to stun him to steal his money. The way she walks to the machine and puts the stun gun up high up in her arm and getting ready to stun this guy is just great! How she stuns the guy is actually not shown. You just see the guy lieing there passed out. She shoves the money in a waitresses' pocket to help her out.  She innocently sips something to drink and drives by 2 cops who are looking at her and points a gun at them and it turns out to be a water pistol which she aims at them and squirts water onto both of their faces. They go after her. She then sees guys playing hockey on the streets and tries to run them over. The music stops for a second and we hear a great sound before she sees another guy in a red car getting gas. She ends up stealing the car and they drive around again during this there are flashbacks of Madonna getting ready before getting into her yellow car in the beginning. She goes through all of her drivers licenses which actually shows her in many different pictures throughout her career. She puts on a suit to protect her from being physically hurt in a car accident and you see her grandmother watching a show that shows cops in cars on TV chasing after the bad guys. Those are the 3 flashbacks. At the end of the video she commits suicide with her grandmother as her car hits a wall and gets completely banged up.  The music from this video is not the original version that is found on the Music album it is the Above And Beyond Mix found on her WIFLFAG remix CD. The DVD shows good messages. It shows us how woman are sterotyped in life for not being as smart enough and strong enough emotionally as men. It also shows us Madonna's female power when she gets back at all the men, which I truely loved. The video as it shows really tells us what it really feels like for a girl in our society these days.  I highly recommend this video it's very good and really not that violent!

That said, a small percentage defy the few &quot;hits&quot; and then oblivion, fighting that chart-topping mainstream fight. This type of artist stays afloat by modifying themselves, adjusting to the times and experimenting with the new flavors and sonic fashions. They write and rewrite themselves, making sure new audiences note what older audiences have already grown to love. Successfully doing that, playing every formula on the field, and one - at least in mainstream success - goes far.Within defining someone with &quot;staying power,&quot; a few names come to mind. Amongst those spoken often, Madonna seems to be firmly rooted. Yes, she's redesigned herself a multitude of times while defining herself as an &quot;artist,&quot; sometimes met with love and sometimes with the cancellation of commercials while doing so but each time being noticed. Accordingly, she's spanned decades. And now, adding Guy Richie into the visual mix and letting him shuffle some violent undertones into the fray, she's found yet another niche where she might not have been able to get before. She's located people like myself that weren't really sold on her body of works without that type of appeal.While the video for &quot;What if Feels Like For a Girl&quot; isn't perhaps for anyone and it wasn't - in my opinion - violent enough to be &quot;banned,&quot; it did seem to fit just right when I watched it.O, how it did it.While marking that remixed beat that unravels before onlooking eyes, I found myself focused on doing what a girl what's to do when she apparently wants to do it. And, according to this vision, she wants to go out with a bang. She first picks up an elderly rider, taking her out in her lovely sportscar, and then she proceeds to introduce herself to the world. And the way she does it is a tapestry of beauty in the making.Guys winking at her in the car to her right, annoying her while she's sitting at a stoplight? Well, the car will fit into their driver's side door nicely.Need some money and don't want to bother with your own ATM withdrawal? Isn't that what stun guns are made for?Don't like street hockey? Well, you've obviously never played it with a car.Over and over again, the images clash with the authoritarian views of what is/isn't proper until, in the end, eventuality comes calling in a superb crescendo of imagery.If you've never seen this and don't think Madonna fits you, then maybe you should try it on anyhow. Technotronic remixes making melody to watch violence by is a NICE thing.
