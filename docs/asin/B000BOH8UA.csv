I came to this movie with the highest hopes, but was sorely disappointed. Where to begin? First, the screenplay was absolutely horrible. The writers crammed every war movie cliche into the script. And, as in many recent vintage war films (see Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates), the writers felt compelled to insert a contrived romance into the movie that killed the flow of the film. Finally, the acting was just horrible. Benjamin Bratt was totally unconvincing in the ""John Wayne role."" It is possible to make an ensemble war movie without a bunch of pretty boy actors masquerading as soldiers (see Band of Brothers).  James Franco especially bad. It was almost as though he was doing an Elvis impersination and totally lacked the gravitas his role required. On the plus side, the film did strive for historical accuracy. But the lack of attention to details was glaring. E.g., considering that the Army Rangers were crawling through the jungle for three days, by the 3rd day all were clean shaven and their clothes were still clean. And for prisoners that had been starved and beaten for three years, many of them looked like they just stepped out of the gym.

946532,A1KKIA6JUFGUNZ,B000BOH8UA,Alan D. Cranford,"[5, 5]","The Great Raid is in many ways a traditional film. The American war film is an outgrowth of the western (as is the detective/crime movie)--this one paints the Japanese as cruel and the Americans as mostly great guys. Because the depiction of Imperial Japan is accurate, I'm surprised that Japan hasn't lodged diplomatic protests! Maybe I just missed them.The events in the Great Raid are an interesting bit of history. 6th Ranger Battalion was formed from a line unit and went through a unique selection and training cycle for Special Forces units. The raid to liberate a POW camp was most definitely one of the few profitable battalion-sized special operations, although in ""military terms"" the raid was a ""waste of resources"" that ""failed to hasten the end of the war."" Can't please the critic!!! In the movie, Lockheed Electra aircraft were used instead of the P-61 Black Widow night fighters that provided the diversion. Most of the infantry small arms were correct--right down to the battalion commander's personal M1903 Springfield rifle instead of the issue M1 Garand. Oh, there is a lot of dramatic license in this movie. Part of the Hollywood Tradition is throwing in a love story for the female half of the audience, whether it detracts from the story or not. The Philippine underground activities and the Japanese secret police response may or may not be historically accurate, but you won't find very many screen dramas featuring Japan's own Gestapo.I cannot help but critic this Ranger operation from a modern media viewpoint. ""Why did you have to pick on the poor Japanese? Was the price in lives really worth it--saving those American war criminals??"" From the American World War Two viewpoint, and from the viewpoint of modern American military personnel, the answer is a resounding YES! Jessica Lynch was not the only American rescued by special operations personnel facing unknown risks, but she is the most famous rescue of the last decade. In the American military, there are few operations more highly regarded than those rescuing American service members held captive by a savagely brutal foe.I enjoyed the movie on several counts, warts and all. Oddly enough, this movie follows the grand tradition of WWII movies from 1942 to the late 1960's. The Great Raid has a few glitches (for us amateur historians), but is at least as historically accurate as current media war coverage and quite entertaining, too.",5,Follows a great tradition of war movies,1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,2429,"['Great', 'Raid', 'many', 'ways', 'traditional', 'film', 'American', 'war', 'film', 'outgrowth', 'western', 'detective/crime', 'movie', 'one', 'Japanese', 'cruel', 'Americans', 'mostly', 'great', 'guys', 'depiction', 'Imperial', 'Japan', 'accurate', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Japan', ""n't"", 'lodged', 'diplomatic', 'protests', 'Maybe', 'just', 'missed', 'them.The', 'events', 'Great', 'Raid', 'are', 'interesting', 'bit', 'history', '6th', 'Ranger', 'Battalion', 'was', 'formed', 'line', 'unit', 'went', 'unique', 'selection', 'training', 'cycle', 'Special', 'Forces', 'units', 'raid', 'liberate', 'POW', 'camp', 'was', 'most', 'definitely', 'one', 'few', 'profitable', 'battalion-sized', 'special', 'operations', 'military', 'terms', 'raid', 'was', 'waste', 'resources', 'failed', 'hasten', 'end', 'war', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'please', 'critic', 'movie', 'Lockheed', 'Electra', 'aircraft', 'were', 'used', 'instead', 'P-61', 'Black', 'Widow', 'night', 'fighters', 'provided', 'diversion', 'Most', 'infantry', 'small', 'arms', 'were', 'correct', 'right', 'battalion', 'commander', 'personal', 'M1903', 'Springfield', 'rifle', 'instead', 'issue', 'M1', 'Garand', 'Oh', 'lot', 'dramatic', 'license', 'movie', 'Part', 'Hollywood', 'Tradition', 'throwing', 'love', 'story', 'female', 'half', 'audience', 'story', 'not', 'Philippine', 'underground', 'activities', 'Japanese', 'secret', 'police', 'response', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'historically', 'accurate', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'very', 'many', 'screen', 'dramas', 'featuring', 'Japan', 'own', 'Gestapo.I', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'critic', 'Ranger', 'operation', 'modern', 'media', 'viewpoint', 'Why', 'did', 'have', 'pick', 'poor', 'Japanese', 'Was', 'price', 'lives', 'really', 'saving', 'American', 'war', 'criminals', 'American', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'viewpoint', 'viewpoint', 'modern', 'American', 'military', 'personnel', 'answer', 'resounding', 'YES', 'Jessica', 'Lynch', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'American', 'rescued', 'special', 'operations', 'personnel', 'facing', 'unknown', 'risks', 'most', 'famous', 'rescue', 'last', 'decade', 'American', 'military', 'are', 'few', 'operations', 'more', 'highly', 'regarded', 'rescuing', 'American', 'service', 'members', 'held', 'captive', 'savagely', 'brutal', 'foe.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'several', 'counts', 'warts', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'movie', 'grand', 'tradition', 'WWII', 'movies', '1942', 'late', '1960', 'Great', 'Raid', 'few', 'glitches', 'amateur', 'historians', 'least', 'historically', 'accurate', 'current', 'media', 'war', 'coverage', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'too']",N/A

946536,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,B000BOH8UA,Anthony Hand,"[4, 24]","It's a shame that America still feels the need to populate its WWII movies with quite appalling propaganda devices 60+ years after the event. It displays a silly immaturity and stymies attempts by directors to produce decent, intelligent and truthful movies about the conflict.""The Great Raid"" is, unfortunately, one of those movies that falls into that category. It is really little more than wartime propaganda molded for a modern day audience and drops into all of the usual propaganda pitfalls. The most obvious of which is its depiction of the Japanese during WWII.From the, frankly, ridiculous opening section to the end credits, the Japanese only appear onscreen to perform some kind of atrocity or to be cartoonish cut-out to be booed. The first time we see the Japanese, they herd some POWs into pits and cover them with fuel (not that they needed every single drop pf fuel at this stage of the war, of course). They then light the fuel and burn the soldiers to death, shooting those who try to escape. Now, that the Japanese historically treated POW's of many Nations with great cruelty apart, the director's suggestion that they would go through the bother of dousing them in fuel and burning them to death, when simply shooting them would have done the job, is absurd. While this suits propaganda, it certain doesn't do reality any credit.It's a stupid and insulting plot device designed to make the audience hate the Japanese from the off and it sets the tone for the rest for the movie. This is a great shame, because ""The Great Raid"", based on a real historical event, could have been a very good film. As it stands, though, one is left wondering how much of this ""true"" story is based on true events.The reason for this cartoon barbarity is a supposed order from the Japanese high command to eliminate all the POW's in captivity before McArthur's men over run everything. As a student of WWII, this is the first time I have ever heard of such an order and as such, view it with some suspicion. Apart from that, if such an order had been given, the Japanese, in the movie, take a long time to go about the business.Apart from the film's depiction of the Japanese, its running time and plotting let it down rather badly. It's at least 30 minutes too long and focuses on less significant characters far too much. On top of that, the actual raid of the title is confined to the last half hour of the film. So we have a lot of fluff and nonsense to deal with until we get to the point of the movie. As a result, the raid is reduced to a sideshow and doesn't seem that `Great' after all.The positive sides are that it is rather well shot, if a little over contrasted. There are some nice incidental shots of aircraft flying overhead and some nice period vehicles used. As to their authenticity, I cannot say whether they fit the bill or not. In general, the acting is quite good, but, as mentioned before, the Japanese characters are laughable, to say the least.At the end of the day, the topic of POW's in Japanese captivity has been done before, and better too, in such films as ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" or ""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"", which includes scenes of atrocity in Japanese captivity, but excludes the cartoonish Japanese characters.",2,The great skirmish,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,3258,"['shame', 'America', 'still', 'need', 'populate', 'WWII', 'movies', 'quite', 'appalling', 'propaganda', 'devices', '60+', 'years', 'event', 'silly', 'immaturity', 'stymies', 'attempts', 'directors', 'produce', 'decent', 'intelligent', 'truthful', 'movies', 'conflict', 'Great', 'Raid', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'movies', 'category', 'really', 'little', 'more', 'wartime', 'propaganda', 'molded', 'modern', 'day', 'audience', 'usual', 'propaganda', 'pitfalls', 'most', 'obvious', 'depiction', 'Japanese', 'frankly', 'ridiculous', 'opening', 'section', 'end', 'credits', 'Japanese', 'only', 'appear', 'onscreen', 'perform', 'kind', 'atrocity', 'be', 'cartoonish', 'cut-out', 'be', 'booed', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'Japanese', 'herd', 'POWs', 'pits', 'cover', 'fuel', 'not', 'needed', 'single', 'drop', 'pf', 'fuel', 'stage', 'war', 'course', 'then', 'light', 'fuel', 'burn', 'soldiers', 'death', 'shooting', 'who', 'try', 'escape', 'Now', 'Japanese', 'historically', 'treated', 'POW', 'many', 'Nations', 'great', 'cruelty', 'apart', 'director', 'suggestion', 'would', 'go', 'bother', 'dousing', 'fuel', 'burning', 'death', 'when', 'simply', 'shooting', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'job', 'absurd', 'suits', 'propaganda', 'certain', ""n't"", 'do', 'reality', 'credit.It', 'stupid', 'insulting', 'plot', 'device', 'designed', 'make', 'audience', 'hate', 'Japanese', 'off', 'tone', 'rest', 'movie', 'great', 'shame', 'Great', 'Raid', 'based', 'real', 'historical', 'event', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'though', 'one', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'true', 'story', 'based', 'true', 'events.The', 'reason', 'cartoon', 'barbarity', 'supposed', 'order', 'Japanese', 'high', 'command', 'eliminate', 'POW', 'captivity', 'McArthur', 'men', 'run', 'everything', 'student', 'WWII', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'such', 'order', 'such', 'view', 'suspicion', 'Apart', 'order', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'take', 'long', 'time', 'go', 'business.Apart', 'film', 'depiction', 'Japanese', 'running', 'time', 'plotting', 'let', 'down', 'rather', 'badly', 'least', '30', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'less', 'significant', 'characters', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'top', 'actual', 'raid', 'title', 'confined', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'have', 'lot', 'fluff', 'nonsense', 'deal', 'get', 'point', 'movie', 'result', 'raid', 'reduced', 'sideshow', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Great', 'all.The', 'positive', 'sides', 'are', 'rather', 'well', 'shot', 'little', 'over', 'contrasted', 'are', 'nice', 'incidental', 'shots', 'aircraft', 'flying', 'overhead', 'nice', 'period', 'vehicles', 'used', 'authenticity', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'fit', 'bill', 'not', 'general', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'mentioned', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'are', 'laughable', 'say', 'least.At', 'end', 'day', 'topic', 'POW', 'Japanese', 'captivity', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'too', 'such', 'films', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'Merry', 'Christmas', 'Mr.', 'Lawrence', 'scenes', 'atrocity', 'Japanese', 'captivity', 'cartoonish', 'Japanese', 'characters']",N/A

The bridge looked like that in 'Bridge over the River Kwai.'Terry Webber could play the major with malaria who was loved by the nurse, Margaret; if a play is done of GHOST SOLDIERS, I hope Terry does it.  He's a marvelous and versatile actor of the highest caliber.  The major's death was similar to Bonheofur't which happened right before that war ended, a few days earlier, what a tradegy.  The love story in this movie was sad, as he did not know how to say ""I love you"" like so many men; the letter he wrote telling her, ""You mean the world to me; I miss you more than you could know; With all my love"" arrived too late.  Men lose out on so much by refusing to love the right woman.When the orange flare lit the skies over the camp, it was like Booms Day in Knoxville, this Saturday.  Fireworks galore from the Henley Street bridge, to commemorate our independence. All of the acting in this film was spectacular.  It was a great war adventure told in compassionate ways.  We lose too many young Americans in wars.  Can't the world live in peace just once!The book is the mesmerizing story of a remarkable mission of the rescue of 513 American POWs in January, 1945, as the war drew to an end.  They were held captive as POWs in a camp near Cabu in Japan.  In 1944, some of these survivors had made a sixty mile march along the Bataan Peninsula amd were trapped in trying conditions.  'The New York Times' calls it ""riveting and patriotically stirring.""  Quite so, matey.When the United States dropped the bomb on Hiroshima and, ten hours later, in the Phillippines, the 121 U. S. troops set out to save our men as they were being burned and shot on the field.  MacArthur had promised to return, and yet the President of the United States had an on-going feud with him to keep him away.  It seems that my hero, MacArthur had gotten a bit too attached to the 60,000 Phillippian people.  He was married to a Tennessee woman.  The soldiers called him ""dugout Doug.""  The author of the book lived in Memphis, Tennessee.  As does Li'l Penny Hardaway and Arthur Friend.The San Francisco Chronicle' calls this a ""compelling story filled with colorful characters"" and heroes.

But I was terribly saddened to see MULTIPLE SCENES MISSING from the ""Director's Cut"" Blu-ray DVD release, scenes which were included in the standard DVD release of this film.GONE is the scene where Margaret (Connie Nielsen) and Cora (Eugenia Yuan) are attempting to buy quinine from the Filipino underground, and are forced to flee for their lives when they realize they're being set up for a robbery.GONE is the scene where Margaret is first accosted by the Kempetai officer at her apartment, and is slapped by the soldiers after trying to push past them to reenter her apartment.GONE is the scene where the Rangers are under the bridge in the dark of night, and the Japanese truck stops so one of the soldiers can relieve himself.GONE is the scene where Margaret attempts to buy passage on an evacuation truck in the jungle, and uses her watch to buy additional rides for the poor woman & daughter who didn't have enough money.Can someone please explain to me why these scenes were cut? Granted, there was additional footage included in the Blu-ray edition that wasn't in the standard DVD release. But they were just extentions of scenes that were unimportant to the film, and certainly not worthy of the scenes that were sacrificed to make room for the extended scenes. But why sacrifice scenes at all? Isn't Blu-ray supposed to hold four times the data of a regular, standard DVD? Would it have killed those money-grubbing thieves in Corporate to have included both the new, extended scenes as well as the old scenes that were removed?

In an era when Amnesty International characterizes Guantanamo Bay's holding facility as akin to Soviet death camps it is, of course, politically incorrect to show anyone but Americans as brutal.  That's why, no doubt, a number of reviewers of this film expressed various reservations about this competently told story of the most successful rescue mission in US military history.  The latter half of the film shows how this was accomplished, and thus is replete with a lot more action than the first half; detailing 5 eventful days in January of 1945.  The Cabanatuan POW camp is eventually stormed, freeing 611 American POWs with the loss of just 2 US Army Rangers & 21 Filipino guerilla fighters.  The film is well shot; looks ""right,"" regarding the era in which it is set, and conveys the gravity of that difficult time as well.

946545,AF8NC7SYC33JB,B000BOH8UA,"Camera Guy ""hhcamera""","[1, 1]","As an avid reader of non-fiction (Ghost Soldiers) this is one of my favorite books made into a movie. This is the story of the Greatest Raid almost forgotten.The movie recounts the story of the Ranger unit performing the raid, the Filipino guerrillas, Japanese captors and the POWs to be rescued.Sides recount the history of the Bataan Death March, the Battle of Corregidor and their relationship to the Cabanatuan POW camp.In March of 1942 more than 75,000 (66,000 Filipinos, 1,000 Chinese Filipinos, and 11,796 Americans captured by the Japanese army in the Philippines were forced to march, 90-miles in deep dust, over vehicle-broken macadam roads. Known now as the Bataan Death March, the men were then crammed into rail cars and sent to Camp O'Donnell. Thousands died en route from disease, starvation, dehydration, heat prostration, untreated wounds, and wanton execution. Those few who were lucky enough to travel to San Fernando on trucks still had to endure more than twenty-five miles of marching. Prisoners were beaten randomly, and were often denied promised food and water. Those who fell behind were usually executed or left to die. The sides of the roads became littered with dead bodies and those begging for help.On the Bataan Death March, approximately 54,000 of the 75,000 prisoners reached their destination. The death toll of the march is difficult to assess, as thousands of captives were able to escape from their guards. All told, approximately 5,000-10,000 Filipino and 600-650 American prisoners of war died before they could reach Camp O'Donnell.Acting as a staging camp, many of these American prisoners then were sent to prison camps in Japan, Korea, and Manchuria in transports known as ""hell shipsSome that were attacked and sunk by allied forces unaware the POW's were abord.Not until the winter of 1944, and almost three years was there a rescue attempt made for fear of an all out massacre of the POW's.The Movie tells the story through not only the Rangers eyes but through the eyes of Filipino guerrillas who were key because most of them were on the Bataan march. On June 6 1942 the Filipino Soldiers were granted Amnesty by the Japanese military and released.No doubt to make the people of the Philippines less likely to revolt and because they were no longer viewed as a threat to them.They were Key because they knew the camp and the country, a big mistake by the Japanese.On the 30th January 1945 US Army Rangers, Alamo Scouts and Filipino guerrillas freed the remaining 500 POW's in an amazing rescue that still today is unparalleled.Some say the movie is to long, and has two many sub plots but how do you tell a story this big in the time restraints of a Movie?It should have been more of a Band of Brothers Mini Series that had at least three Parts.The three-month Battle of Bataan, the POW's stories and the Raid itself all recounted by survivors, Filipino Soldiers and American.Movies like this help to remind us of the lows in our history and how we should never forget or be forced to repeat them.

Mind you, this is not a popcorn flick.  The focus is mainly on the titular endeavor.  The film's weakness, in my opinion, are the deviating sub-plots from the raid itself.The title refers to a true-to-life mission to rescue 500 American POWs from a Japanese prison camp in the Philippine city of Cabanatuan during the second world war.  There's a fictional love-story element of the film which I will no longer further discuss.  Let's just forget it.The film sort of centers around Captain Prince (James Franco - you know, Harry Osbourne from Spider-Man films) as he devises a strategy to accomplish the near-impossible mission.  The reality of the situation causes him to revise his strategy repeatedly, much to the behest of his senior officer Lt. Col. Mucci (Benjamin Bratt).  Together they lead a highly-trained yet untested group of US Army Rangers and along the way run into Capt. Juan Pajota (Cesar Montano - a Filipino actor who wowed me previously in Jose Rizal) and his band of underestimated guerillas.The beauty of the film is it's strict focus on the task at hand.  These are soldiers who are fighting to survive while trying to accomplish a mission.  That's the reality of war.  The strategy was repeatedly changed to adapt to an ever fluid situation so that the maximum number of troops can return home.So I highly recommend this film, if you can still catch it.

Several details/problems struck me:1) the terrain is clearly NOT the Phillipines. They could've picked a better location to film the approaches to the camp - a large part of it looked like it was filmed in autumn woodlands in southeastern USA. I will say however, the camp itself looked fairly accurate based on old photos I've seen.2) As others have pointed out, the ""nurse"" and the Manila hospital scenes did not occur. The ""nurse"" who is involved in the resistance organization (smuggling medicine to the camp) was in fact a lady who operated an enterainment club/bordello. Too mcuh license was taken with that.3) The POWs are over-dressed. Most of the prisoners were reduced to wearing only shorts or loincloths and perhaps some kind of homemade sandals by the time of the Raid. In that heat, most were NOT wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts after 3 yrs! I suspect the producers may've done that in an attempt to avoid needing characters who looked truly starved, which was the true state of the prisoners. Ah well.4) The movie shows the Japs bringing in fuel drums, presumably to repeat the executions (murders) as had occurred at Palawan. But by the time of the Raid, the Japanese were so critically low on fuel they were resorting to all sorts of ersatz fuel such as coconut oil (read the book Ghost Soldiers to verify this). No way they would've wasted precious fuel in this way.5) As to the movie itself, there were far too many subplots and tangents. It took away from the historical story, if you will. This could've been an accurate drama that told the historical story without an attempt to include a ""love interest"" (which was weakly portrayed anyway).There were other problems w/ the film, but I'll stop here... Good opportunity lost, in my opinion. But perhaps at least it may have served to renew interest in this little known feat of WW2...",2,A missed opportunity....,1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,2021,"['Unfortunately', 'must', 'give', 'one', '2', 'stars', 'really', '2', '3', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'better', 'popularize', 'great', 'story', 'Several', 'details/problems', 'struck', 'me:1', 'terrain', 'clearly', 'NOT', 'Phillipines', 'could', ""'ve"", 'picked', 'better', 'location', 'film', 'approaches', 'camp', 'large', 'part', 'looked', 'was', 'filmed', 'autumn', 'woodlands', 'southeastern', 'USA', 'will', 'say', 'however', 'camp', 'looked', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'based', 'old', 'photos', ""'ve"", 'seen.2', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'nurse', 'Manila', 'hospital', 'scenes', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'nurse', 'who', 'involved', 'resistance', 'organization', 'smuggling', 'medicine', 'camp', 'was', 'fact', 'lady', 'who', 'operated', 'enterainment', 'club/bordello', 'Too', 'mcuh', 'license', 'was', 'taken', 'that.3', 'POWs', 'are', 'over-dressed', 'Most', 'prisoners', 'were', 'reduced', 'wearing', 'only', 'loincloths', 'perhaps', 'kind', 'homemade', 'sandals', 'time', 'Raid', 'heat', 'most', 'were', 'NOT', 'wearing', 'long', 'pants', 'long-sleeved', 'shirts', '3', 'yrs', 'suspect', 'producers', 'may', ""'ve"", 'done', 'attempt', 'avoid', 'needing', 'characters', 'who', 'looked', 'truly', 'starved', 'was', 'true', 'state', 'prisoners', 'Ah', 'well.4', 'movie', 'Japs', 'bringing', 'fuel', 'drums', 'presumably', 'repeat', 'executions', 'murders', 'had', 'occurred', 'Palawan', 'time', 'Raid', 'Japanese', 'were', 'so', 'critically', 'low', 'fuel', 'were', 'resorting', 'sorts', 'ersatz', 'fuel', 'such', 'coconut', 'oil', 'read', 'book', 'Ghost', 'Soldiers', 'verify', 'way', 'would', ""'ve"", 'wasted', 'precious', 'fuel', 'way.5', 'movie', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'tangents', 'took', 'away', 'historical', 'story', 'will', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'accurate', 'drama', 'told', 'historical', 'story', 'attempt', 'include', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'weakly', 'portrayed', 'anyway', 'were', 'other', 'problems', 'w/', 'film', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'here', 'Good', 'opportunity', 'lost', 'opinion', 'perhaps', 'least', 'may', 'have', 'served', 'renew', 'interest', 'little', 'known', 'feat', 'WW2']",N/A

946554,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000BOH8UA,Craig Matteson,"[2, 2]","Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese successfully drove back the American Forces in the Philippines.  Thousands were too forward to get to the rapidly retreating Naval Forces of General Douglas MacArthur (who vowed to return) and were faced with alternative of fighting to the death or surrendering and so surrendered.  The Japanese military did not expect the surrender because their ethos forbad it.  I am sure you remember the occasional news stories of the old Japanese soldiers being found in the jungle who believed the war continued.  Faced with thousands of prisoners they did not expect to have and had no facilities to care for, they put them on a 55 mile march without food or water in deadly heat.  It became known as the Baatan Death March because more than a thousand died or were murdered because they could not keep up.Many of these prisoners died in the care of the Japanese who committed many atrocities on them including withholding of Red Cross packages containing food and medicine to help them fight malaria.  When the Americans returned and began retaking the Philippines in 1944, the Japanese began liquidating all their prisoners.  This movie is about one very successful raid on the prison camp at Cabantuan.  The 6th Rangers battalion were assigned to go ahead of the front line and make a daring raid of the camp through Japanese occupied jungle and across open fields to the camp in order to rescue the hundreds of prisoners there before the Japanese murdered them.  We are shown one camp where the Japanese had burned the prisoners alive and machine gunned those trying to escape the flames.This is a very good movie about how the daring plan was drawn up and executed.  It also shows us the horrible conditions the prisoners faced and how they struggled to survive.  Many did not.  Another story line shows us the Philippine underground and the dangers they faced from the Japanese secret police.  It is the weaving together of these three story lines and their convergence that make the movie work.  While some have complained that the movie doesn't make the rescue into a thriller with a kind of ticking deadline.  However, that would have been a fictionalization of the story.  The reality is that the Japanese were going to kill the soldiers, but the timing was not exact.  Certainly, it would have been before the advancing Americans arrived.The Rangers' work was complicated by huge number of retreating Japanese, many of whom were garrisoned at Cabanatuan - instead of the hundred soldiers the original plan called for.  Luckily, there were brave and experienced Philippine guerillas that volunteered to help.While the movie has an ""R"" rating, it is not nearly as violent as ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Black Hawk Down"".  In fact, the story telling is more like a sixties movie than the modern quick-cut and hyper violent films we have been getting lately.  I can see why they didn't give it a PG-13, but it is more like that than it is the kind of hard ""R"" films being shown at the local multiplex.This is a piece of history that should be seen, remembered, and talked about.  I am surprised that I never heard of this raid until seeing this film.  I think it is terrific and recommend it enthusiastically.  The stars are all cast well and do very fine work in their roles.

946557,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000BOH8UA,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[89, 96]","The Great Raid is one of the best war movies I've seen in several years, and it makes me downright mad to learn of this film's long-neglected, still overlooked history.  It was filmed in 2002, then delayed for three full years thanks to a bunch of bureaucratic jabberwocky.  When it finally saw the light of day in 2005, I didn't hear the first thing about it, which says a lot about the marketing behind it.  Then, a number of professional critics cast aspersions upon it - all the usual suspects who prefer their own make-believe world where the worst sadists are merely misunderstood victims of a bad childhood and real history is just something to be distorted in pursuit of your own political agenda.  The Great Raid is just far too true for these elitists, and - even worse - it shows that war, as horrible as it is, is sometimes a necessity in the face of outright evil.  These guys can blanch and puff up all they like, but anyone who knows anything about World War II knows that the Japanese were some of the most merciless, brutal, downright sadistic soldiers the world has ever seen.  That very concept is incorporated into this movie because it's true.  The Great Raid adds a few unnecessary romantic elements to the story, but that story itself is an honorably realistic presentation of the most audacious, successful rescue mission in American military history.  It's a story every American should know - but more than likely doesn't.There was a good reason why General MacArthur vowed to return after FDR ordered him to withdraw from the Philippines - he was leaving a lot of good men behind, brave soldiers who suffered and died horribly after their Commander in Chief abandoned them.  As FDR concentrated on the European theater, thousands of GI's died on the unspeakable Bataan Death March, while those who did survive the 60-mile trek were subjected to brutal, inhumane treatment in Japanese POW camps for three years.  In January 1945, the military tide had turned, MacArthur had indeed returned to the Philippines, and the Japanese knew the end was in sight.  War criminals to the end, they chose to slaughter all of their prisoners before they could be liberated.  That set the stage for The Great Raid.  The Allies knew the 500+ prisoners of war at Cabanatuan would be killed as their forces closed in on the camp.  The only hope of saving these brave, long-suffering Americans was to execute a surprise rescue mission and take the Japanese completely by surprise.This movie shows us pretty much what actually happened, and it is that commitment to historical reality that makes it such an important film.  We watch Lt. Col. Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt) and Capt. Bob Prince (James Franco) draw up the plans, lead their soldiers forward, adapt and react to unexpected Japanese troop movements, and basically refuse to let anything stop them from leaving any American POW behind.  These particular troops, from the 6th Army Ranger Battalion, had yet to see any real action for the most part, but they managed to cross 30 miles of enemy territory and sneak up on the camp across open fields in broad daylight without being detected.  Meanwhile, brave Filipino soldiers provided invaluable assistance by preventing Japanese reinforcements from reaching the camp in time to disrupt the mission.  The big firefight, when it does come, is quite intense and realistic, leading up to an emotionally stirring ending.Alongside the viewpoint of the Rangers and their Filipino brethren in arms, the film also takes us inside the Japanese POW camp and acquaints us with the Filipino underground sneaking much-needed medicines into the camp.  All of these heroes of different stripes aren't enough to satisfy the critics, though.  They say the movie drags on too long, yet they complain that the POW camp conditions aren't covered in enough detail.  They decry the scenes of Japanese barbarity, preferring their own little world of politically correct grey to the black and white reality of history.  Folks, it doesn't get much more black and white than this: risking your life -against great odds - to rescue your brother soldiers is good; burning POWs alive rather than allowing them to be liberated is evil.  Some things really are black and white.  If you insist on pretending that everyone on earth really just wants to chase butterflies in the sun all day, you may not like this movie.  If, on the other hand, you like a good war movie, especially one that is based on fact and presented in a realistic fashion, The Great Raid more than deserves a place in your personal DVD collection.",5,One of the best war movies of recent years,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,4601,"['Great', 'Raid', 'one', 'best', 'war', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'years', 'downright', 'mad', 'learn', 'film', 'long-neglected', 'still', 'overlooked', 'history', 'was', 'filmed', '2002', 'then', 'delayed', 'three', 'full', 'years', 'thanks', 'bunch', 'bureaucratic', 'jabberwocky', 'When', 'finally', 'saw', 'light', 'day', '2005', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'first', 'thing', 'lot', 'marketing', 'Then', 'number', 'professional', 'critics', 'cast', 'aspersions', 'usual', 'suspects', 'who', 'prefer', 'own', 'make-believe', 'world', 'where', 'worst', 'sadists', 'are', 'merely', 'misunderstood', 'victims', 'bad', 'childhood', 'real', 'history', 'just', 'something', 'be', 'distorted', 'pursuit', 'own', 'political', 'agenda', 'Great', 'Raid', 'just', 'far', 'too', 'true', 'elitists', 'even', 'worse', 'war', 'as', 'horrible', 'sometimes', 'necessity', 'face', 'outright', 'evil', 'guys', 'can', 'blanch', 'puff', 'up', 'like', 'anyone', 'who', 'anything', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Japanese', 'were', 'most', 'merciless', 'brutal', 'downright', 'sadistic', 'soldiers', 'world', 'ever', 'seen', 'very', 'concept', 'incorporated', 'movie', 'true', 'Great', 'Raid', 'few', 'unnecessary', 'romantic', 'elements', 'story', 'story', 'honorably', 'realistic', 'presentation', 'most', 'audacious', 'successful', 'rescue', 'mission', 'American', 'military', 'history', 'story', 'American', 'should', 'know', 'more', 'likely', 'was', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'General', 'MacArthur', 'vowed', 'return', 'FDR', 'ordered', 'withdraw', 'Philippines', 'was', 'leaving', 'lot', 'good', 'men', 'brave', 'soldiers', 'who', 'suffered', 'died', 'horribly', 'Commander', 'Chief', 'abandoned', 'FDR', 'concentrated', 'European', 'theater', 'thousands', 'GI', 'died', 'unspeakable', 'Bataan', 'Death', 'March', 'who', 'did', 'survive', '60-mile', 'trek', 'were', 'subjected', 'brutal', 'inhumane', 'treatment', 'Japanese', 'POW', 'camps', 'three', 'years', 'January', '1945', 'military', 'tide', 'had', 'turned', 'MacArthur', 'had', 'indeed', 'returned', 'Philippines', 'Japanese', 'knew', 'end', 'was', 'sight', 'War', 'criminals', 'end', 'chose', 'slaughter', 'prisoners', 'could', 'be', 'liberated', 'set', 'stage', 'Great', 'Raid', 'Allies', 'knew', '500+', 'prisoners', 'war', 'Cabanatuan', 'would', 'be', 'killed', 'forces', 'closed', 'camp', 'only', 'hope', 'saving', 'brave', 'long-suffering', 'Americans', 'was', 'execute', 'surprise', 'rescue', 'mission', 'take', 'Japanese', 'completely', 'surprise.This', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'commitment', 'historical', 'reality', 'such', 'important', 'film', 'watch', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Henry', 'Mucci', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'Capt', 'Bob', 'Prince', 'James', 'Franco', 'up', 'plans', 'lead', 'soldiers', 'forward', 'adapt', 'react', 'unexpected', 'Japanese', 'troop', 'movements', 'basically', 'refuse', 'let', 'anything', 'stop', 'leaving', 'American', 'POW', 'behind', 'particular', 'troops', '6th', 'Army', 'Ranger', 'Battalion', 'had', 'yet', 'see', 'real', 'action', 'most', 'part', 'managed', 'cross', '30', 'miles', 'enemy', 'territory', 'sneak', 'up', 'camp', 'open', 'fields', 'broad', 'daylight', 'being', 'detected', 'Meanwhile', 'brave', 'Filipino', 'soldiers', 'provided', 'invaluable', 'assistance', 'preventing', 'Japanese', 'reinforcements', 'reaching', 'camp', 'time', 'disrupt', 'mission', 'big', 'firefight', 'when', 'come', 'quite', 'intense', 'realistic', 'leading', 'up', 'emotionally', 'stirring', 'viewpoint', 'Rangers', 'Filipino', 'brethren', 'arms', 'film', 'also', 'Japanese', 'POW', 'camp', 'acquaints', 'Filipino', 'underground', 'sneaking', 'much-needed', 'medicines', 'camp', 'heroes', 'different', 'stripes', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'satisfy', 'critics', 'though', 'say', 'movie', 'too', 'long', 'yet', 'complain', 'POW', 'camp', 'conditions', 'are', ""n't"", 'covered', 'enough', 'detail', 'decry', 'scenes', 'Japanese', 'barbarity', 'preferring', 'own', 'little', 'world', 'politically', 'correct', 'grey', 'black', 'white', 'reality', 'history', 'Folks', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'more', 'black', 'white', 'risking', 'life', '-against', 'great', 'odds', 'rescue', 'brother', 'soldiers', 'good', 'burning', 'POWs', 'alive', 'rather', 'allowing', 'be', 'liberated', 'evil', 'things', 'really', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'insist', 'pretending', 'everyone', 'earth', 'really', 'just', 'chase', 'butterflies', 'sun', 'day', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'good', 'war', 'movie', 'especially', 'one', 'based', 'fact', 'presented', 'realistic', 'fashion', 'Great', 'Raid', 'more', 'place', 'personal', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

946559,A1GQQFTPA23Z1O,B000BOH8UA,Dave,"[9, 11]","Based in part on Hampton Sides' wonderful book Ghost Soldiers, ""The Great Raid"" tells the unbelievable-but-true story of the dangerous rescue mission in late January, 1945,  in which a small group of U.S. Rangers (6th Ranger Battalion) led by Lt. Col. Mucci (Benjamin Bratt) set out to free over 500 American POWs being held at the brutal Japanese prison camp at Cabanatuan in the Philippines. Aided by brave resistance fighters in Manila like Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen), as well as the equally-brave Filipino guerilla fighters, the Rangers carry out their suicidal mission with calmness and amazing courage. This rescue mission is the stuff that legends are made of, and director John Dahl did a masterful job of retelling this great story from World War Two.In the movie you meet extraordinary men and women like Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes), Lt. Col. Mucci (Benjamin Bratt), and Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen), and thankfully the filmmakers didn't try to gloss over the realities of the harsh and hellish conditions which American POWs had to face under Japanese captivity. Be aware that some of the scenes of brutality to prisoners are quite graphic, but viewers need to learn and appreciate the great sacrifices made by the Greatest Generation in WWII. This is one of the finest war films ever made, with exceptional performances and brilliant direction. The real footage of the Rangers that's shown during the closing credits is a nice touch.

The fast paced action is based on the real life rescue of the American POWs at Capanatuan in the Philippines.  Director John Dahl pulls no punches.  He correctly depicts the allied forces as the good guys and the Japanese as generally nothing less than war criminals. This is indeed historically accurate and Dahl refuses to shy away from the truth merely to satisfy the politically correct leftist crowd.  Lt. Colonel Mucci (Benjamin Bratt) and Captain Prince (James Franco) were ordered to devise a plan that could quickly free as many of the sickly and malnourished prisoners like Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes) as possible. Time is short. The war is almost over and Emperor Hirohito's followers of Bushido prefer death to surrender.  If they are going to die, so too will the POWs.  The pitiless Japanese particularly enjoy burning prisoners alive.  They were, during that time period, racists to the core and perceived non-Japanese as inferior and unworthy of humane consideration.Lt. Colonel Mucci partners with the fearless Philippine guerillas.  They in turn rely on Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen) and other members of the resistance to supply them with support and intelligence.  The violence is brutal and not for the squeamish.  There will be moments when you might even be inclined to turn your eyes away from the screen.  Are the Japanese today as evil as their predecessors of some sixty years ago?  Of course not, and we must not forget that all races, ethnic groups, and nationalities are comprised of moral and immoral individuals.  There are few remaining WWII veterans.  They fought to save our freedoms and constitutional rights.  The least we can do, is to make an effort to more fully understand their struggles and heroism.

It follows the traditional pattern of American War films but the action sequences and underplayed roles gave it a feeling of authenticity  not always found in the genre. While the action is heated for only a short while, it sparks the picture. The acting is nicely underplayed allowing no room for a shift of attention from the roles played to the actors playing them.  Admirably, despite having 60 years distance from the events, the creative staff managed to keep its focus on the  perspective one might have had watching this film during that war when we knew that men and women were still to be sacrificed to the megalomania of a leadership group striving to make their nation the center of THE ONLY great Pacific power. So far as I could tell, while there was a need for fictionalization of precise facts and figures, the more general picture was as it might well have been.All  in all,  this is a picture which grips one and also  reminds us that neither the European nor the Pacific allies of the Axis fought by Marquis of Queens-berry rules.

Thurlow,"[2, 2]","The January 1945 raid 30 miles behind enemy lines by the U.S Army's 6th Ranger Battalion to free 500 U.S. POWs from Japanese captivity is justly famous, if not widely known, as a high risk but very successful special operation.  One hundred twenty rangers, assisted by the Filipino resistance, stormed a POW camp held by twice their number in Japanese and saved the POWs from almost certain execution by the Japanese.  ""The Great Raid"" brings that event to the big screen in an epic movie-making style reminiscent of earlier films such as ""Saving Private Ryan.""The movie simultaneously tracks the Rangers' trek through the jungles to the camp, the plight of the POWs inside Cabantuan Camp, and the work of the Filipino resistance in Manila and around the camp.  The story of the Rangers focuses on Lieutenant Colonel Henry Mucci, the charismatic Ranger Battalion Commander, played by Benjamin Bratt, and Captain Bob Prince, a young Ranger Company Commander who planned the raid, played by James Franco.  The plotline inside the camp centers on the senior American POW, a Major Gibson, played with haunting realism by Joeseph Fiennes, who struggles with the Japanese Commandant to keep his men alive.  Gibson himself is dying of malaria, and sustained largely by the memory of a women he knew in Manila before the war.  That woman, a nurse named Margaret and played by Connie Nielson, is a member of the resistance, smuggling medicines to the camp while dodging the ruthless Japanese Secret Police.  These storylines will come together in the Great Raid.The movie's pacing is very deliberate, letting the suspense slowly build over the course of an operation that took several days, with a minimum of narrative gimmicks.  A prologue in black and white archival imagery  establishing the raid in the context of World War II is overly long but perhaps necessary.  The movie inevitably dramatizes some of the basic facts, but only the relationship between Major Gibson and the nurse in Manila seems something of a stretch.  The attention to detail is exceptional; clothing and equipment look thoroughly authentic to the period.The movie gives appropriate credit to the sacrifices of the Filipnio resistance movement, who smuggled supplies into the POW compounds and blocked Japanese reinforcements from reaching the camp during the raid.  The guerillas also provided the transport necessary to move the POWs back to friendly lines.  This phase of the operation was grueling in and of itself, but gets short coverage in the movie, which climaxes with the assualt on the POW camp.This movie is highly recommended to those interested in a well done and even moving tribute to those who participated in the Great Raid, and to fans of the classic wartime movie epics, now rarely made anymore.  The DVD includes a number of interesting extras on the making of the film.",5,A Modest But Worthwhile Epic,1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,2859,"['January', '1945', 'raid', '30', 'miles', 'enemy', 'lines', 'U.S', 'Army', '6th', 'Ranger', 'Battalion', 'free', '500', 'U.S.', 'POWs', 'Japanese', 'captivity', 'justly', 'famous', 'not', 'widely', 'known', 'high', 'risk', 'very', 'successful', 'special', 'operation', 'One', 'hundred', 'twenty', 'rangers', 'assisted', 'Filipino', 'resistance', 'stormed', 'POW', 'camp', 'held', 'twice', 'number', 'Japanese', 'saved', 'POWs', 'almost', 'certain', 'execution', 'Japanese', 'Great', 'Raid', 'event', 'big', 'screen', 'epic', 'movie-making', 'style', 'reminiscent', 'earlier', 'films', 'such', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'movie', 'simultaneously', 'Rangers', 'trek', 'jungles', 'camp', 'plight', 'POWs', 'Cabantuan', 'Camp', 'work', 'Filipino', 'resistance', 'Manila', 'camp', 'story', 'Rangers', 'focuses', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'Henry', 'Mucci', 'charismatic', 'Ranger', 'Battalion', 'Commander', 'played', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'Captain', 'Bob', 'Prince', 'young', 'Ranger', 'Company', 'Commander', 'who', 'planned', 'raid', 'played', 'James', 'Franco', 'plotline', 'camp', 'centers', 'senior', 'American', 'POW', 'Major', 'Gibson', 'played', 'haunting', 'realism', 'Joeseph', 'Fiennes', 'who', 'Japanese', 'Commandant', 'keep', 'men', 'alive', 'Gibson', 'dying', 'malaria', 'sustained', 'largely', 'memory', 'women', 'knew', 'Manila', 'war', 'woman', 'nurse', 'named', 'Margaret', 'played', 'Connie', 'Nielson', 'member', 'resistance', 'smuggling', 'medicines', 'camp', 'dodging', 'ruthless', 'Japanese', 'Secret', 'Police', 'storylines', 'will', 'come', 'together', 'Great', 'Raid.The', 'movie', 'pacing', 'very', 'deliberate', 'letting', 'suspense', 'slowly', 'build', 'course', 'operation', 'took', 'several', 'days', 'minimum', 'narrative', 'gimmicks', 'prologue', 'black', 'white', 'archival', 'imagery', 'establishing', 'raid', 'context', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'overly', 'long', 'perhaps', 'necessary', 'movie', 'inevitably', 'basic', 'facts', 'only', 'relationship', 'Major', 'Gibson', 'nurse', 'Manila', 'something', 'stretch', 'attention', 'detail', 'exceptional', 'clothing', 'equipment', 'look', 'thoroughly', 'authentic', 'period.The', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'credit', 'sacrifices', 'Filipnio', 'resistance', 'movement', 'who', 'smuggled', 'supplies', 'POW', 'compounds', 'blocked', 'Japanese', 'reinforcements', 'reaching', 'camp', 'raid', 'guerillas', 'also', 'provided', 'transport', 'necessary', 'move', 'POWs', 'back', 'friendly', 'lines', 'phase', 'operation', 'was', 'grueling', 'short', 'coverage', 'movie', 'climaxes', 'assualt', 'POW', 'camp.This', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'interested', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'moving', 'tribute', 'who', 'participated', 'Great', 'Raid', 'fans', 'classic', 'wartime', 'movie', 'epics', 'now', 'rarely', 'made', 'anymore', 'DVD', 'number', 'interesting', 'extras', 'making', 'film']",N/A
946570,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B000BOH8UA,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[1, 2]","The great raid on the Cabatuan Prison Camp in the Philippines on January 30, 1945 is one of the lesser heralded stories of rescue and bravery of World War II. American prisoners who had been captured after the fall of Bataan and Corregidor faced three long years of slow starvation, torture, and unspeakable cruelty from their Japanese captors who regarded those who surrendered as less than dogs.The 6th Army Ranger Battalion is selected to conduct a daring raid in enemy territory and liberate more than 500 prisoners, kill their captors, and return the survivors to safety. Their mission is fraught with danger as they learn of a Japanese division that will cross the path of their destination. They must also negotiate their way across 800 yards of open ground that leads to the camp.This is a two-fold story that takes to the inside of the camp and outside where a Filippino underground conducts a dangerous game of cat and mouse trying to smuggle medicines into the camps. Many of them pay with their lives.Benjamin Bratt plays the real life battalion commander, Lieutenant Col Mucci, a West Point graduate who is determined to get the most out of his rangers.  James Franco,  plays the Captain Bob Prince, a Stanford and ROTC graduate that Mucci selects to plan and execute the raid. Joseph Fiennes plays Major Gibson, the commanding officer of POW's who suffers from a severe bout of malaria. Connie Nielson plays a nurse, Margaret Utinsky, who is up to her neck in spiriting medical contraband to the prisoners.  One gets the impression that Utinsky and Gibson have an unfulfilled love and her clandestine efforts are primarily to express that love at liberation.The movie is graphic in what are almost forgotten Japanese atrocities of pushing prisoners into  air raid tunnels,  sealing them in with barrels of gasoline that they then set ablaze. As the prisoners attempt to escape they are cut down by machine gun fire, which was probably the only mercy they showed the prisoners. (Japanese allowed 30% of their prisoners to die of disease,  or were executed, starved, or beaten to death as opposed to 1% by the Germans).In spite of the taut suspense of the Filippino smuggling operation under surveillance of the Japanese, the movie plods along worse than a 500 yard low crawl. In spite of this tedium, it is a worthwhile experience to follow it through to the raid and actual footage shown at the end.For the two Rangers who died, the 21 Filippino casualties, and the one prisoner who died after liberation.Memorial Day Weekend 2011.",4,Rangers Lead the Way,1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,2545,"['great', 'raid', 'Cabatuan', 'Prison', 'Camp', 'Philippines', 'January', '30', '1945', 'one', 'lesser', 'heralded', 'stories', 'rescue', 'bravery', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'American', 'prisoners', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'captured', 'fall', 'Bataan', 'Corregidor', 'faced', 'three', 'long', 'years', 'slow', 'starvation', 'torture', 'unspeakable', 'cruelty', 'Japanese', 'captors', 'who', 'regarded', 'who', 'surrendered', 'less', 'dogs.The', '6th', 'Army', 'Ranger', 'Battalion', 'selected', 'conduct', 'daring', 'raid', 'enemy', 'territory', 'liberate', 'more', '500', 'prisoners', 'kill', 'captors', 'return', 'survivors', 'safety', 'mission', 'fraught', 'danger', 'learn', 'Japanese', 'division', 'will', 'cross', 'path', 'destination', 'must', 'also', 'negotiate', 'way', '800', 'yards', 'open', 'ground', 'camp.This', 'two-fold', 'story', 'inside', 'camp', 'outside', 'where', 'Filippino', 'underground', 'dangerous', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'trying', 'smuggle', 'medicines', 'camps', 'Many', 'pay', 'lives.Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'real', 'life', 'battalion', 'commander', 'Lieutenant', 'Col', 'Mucci', 'West', 'Point', 'graduate', 'who', 'determined', 'get', 'most', 'rangers', 'James', 'Franco', 'Captain', 'Bob', 'Prince', 'Stanford', 'ROTC', 'graduate', 'Mucci', 'selects', 'plan', 'execute', 'raid', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Major', 'Gibson', 'commanding', 'officer', 'POW', 'who', 'severe', 'bout', 'malaria', 'Connie', 'Nielson', 'nurse', 'Margaret', 'Utinsky', 'who', 'up', 'neck', 'spiriting', 'medical', 'contraband', 'prisoners', 'One', 'impression', 'Utinsky', 'Gibson', 'have', 'unfulfilled', 'love', 'clandestine', 'efforts', 'are', 'primarily', 'express', 'love', 'liberation.The', 'movie', 'graphic', 'what', 'are', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'Japanese', 'atrocities', 'pushing', 'prisoners', 'air', 'raid', 'tunnels', 'sealing', 'barrels', 'gasoline', 'then', 'set', 'ablaze', 'prisoners', 'attempt', 'escape', 'are', 'cut', 'down', 'machine', 'gun', 'fire', 'was', 'probably', 'only', 'mercy', 'showed', 'prisoners', 'Japanese', 'allowed', '30', '%', 'prisoners', 'die', 'disease', 'were', 'executed', 'starved', 'beaten', 'death', 'opposed', '1', '%', 'Germans', '.In', 'spite', 'taut', 'suspense', 'Filippino', 'smuggling', 'operation', 'surveillance', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'plods', 'worse', '500', 'yard', 'low', 'crawl', 'spite', 'tedium', 'worthwhile', 'experience', 'follow', 'raid', 'actual', 'footage', 'shown', 'end.For', 'two', 'Rangers', 'who', 'died', '21', 'Filippino', 'casualties', 'one', 'prisoner', 'who', 'died', 'liberation.Memorial', 'Day', 'Weekend', '2011']",N/A
946571,A1AVSW1LXGBO4Y,B000BOH8UA,"Evan Hinton ""Critic for Hire""","[4, 14]","Of all the wars in recent history, the Second World War is most popular for cinematic stories.  Perhaps that's because it is the last time the entire country was behind a war, so the chance of irritating American viewers is low, or maybe because it was the last really big war, with lots of room for different plots.  At any rate, the era has generated many great films, and some disappointments.""The Great Raid"", about the liberation of a POW camp in the Philippines near the end of the war, falls much closer to the great film category than disappointment, but it is not without its faults.One of the biggest mistakes most war films make is going overboard with the &uuml;berpatriotic ""Isn't-it-great-to-be-an-American?"" stuff which seems so out of place in a movie about people killing each other.  This film doesn't go into that too much, but keeps things relatively straight, detailing the planning of the raid, the conditions inside the camp, and the raid itself, rather than having soldiers spend a great deal of time sitting around talking about why they're fighting the war.  Sure, that's nice and dramatic, but at this point, most of us know why we had to win WWII: otherwise we'd be speaking Japanese or German right now.Unfortunately, ""The Great Raid"" makes another common war movie mistake:  It chooses sides.  The Americans are all pretty faultless, and the Japanese are all evil and cruel.  Ideally, you don't root for either side, but see things objectively, like an outside observer.Avoiding another common error, this film has a cast of relatively unknown actors (the only face I immediately recognized was James Franco from the ""Spider-Man"" films, here playing Capt. Robert Prince, the architect of the raid), rather than peppering the battlefield with Ben Afflecks and Tom Hankses.Besides the main story of the prisoners and the Army Rangers trying to rescue them, there is the subplot about a nurse, Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen), who leads the Philippine Resistance, and tries to get ever-important medicine to the POW's.  Meant to heighten the drama, she is romantically involved with the senior captured officer (Joseph Fiennes), but the love story doesn't seem to work due to its long-distance nature.Of minor importance to casual viewers, but fascinating to anyone interested in 40's era history, period black-and-white footage is used at the beginning and end of the film, transitioning smoothly into the rest of the movie as the opening and closing are filmed in black-and-white.In general, I like war films, even some (such as ""Saving Private Ryan"") with what appears to be gratuitous gore.  Though not as bloody as Steven Spielberg's war film, ""The Great Raid"" earns its R-rating solely on the violence, which is at times incredibly shocking.  It is true what they say, war is Hell, and it is important to be reminded of that from time to time.",4,"""Raid"" nearly gets away perfectly",1123977600,"08 14, 2005",2005,2878,"['wars', 'recent', 'history', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'most', 'popular', 'cinematic', 'stories', 'Perhaps', 'last', 'time', 'entire', 'country', 'was', 'war', 'chance', 'irritating', 'American', 'viewers', 'low', 'maybe', 'was', 'last', 'really', 'big', 'war', 'lots', 'room', 'different', 'plots', 'rate', 'era', 'generated', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'disappointments', 'Great', 'Raid', 'liberation', 'POW', 'camp', 'Philippines', 'end', 'war', 'much', 'closer', 'great', 'film', 'category', 'disappointment', 'not', 'faults.One', 'biggest', 'mistakes', 'most', 'war', 'films', 'make', 'going', 'overboard', 'uuml', 'berpatriotic', ""Isn't-it-great-to-be-an-American"", 'stuff', 'so', 'place', 'movie', 'people', 'killing', 'other', 'film', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'much', 'things', 'relatively', 'straight', 'detailing', 'planning', 'raid', 'conditions', 'camp', 'raid', 'rather', 'having', 'soldiers', 'spend', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'sitting', 'talking', 'why', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'war', 'Sure', 'nice', 'dramatic', 'point', 'most', 'know', 'why', 'had', 'win', 'WWII', 'otherwise', ""'d"", 'be', 'speaking', 'Japanese', 'German', 'right', 'now.Unfortunately', 'Great', 'Raid', 'common', 'war', 'movie', 'mistake', 'sides', 'Americans', 'are', 'pretty', 'faultless', 'Japanese', 'are', 'evil', 'cruel', 'Ideally', 'do', ""n't"", 'root', 'side', 'see', 'things', 'objectively', 'outside', 'observer.Avoiding', 'common', 'error', 'film', 'cast', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'actors', 'only', 'face', 'immediately', 'recognized', 'was', 'James', 'Franco', 'Spider-Man', 'films', 'here', 'playing', 'Capt', 'Robert', 'Prince', 'architect', 'raid', 'rather', 'peppering', 'battlefield', 'Ben', 'Afflecks', 'Tom', 'Hankses.Besides', 'main', 'story', 'prisoners', 'Army', 'Rangers', 'trying', 'rescue', 'subplot', 'nurse', 'Margaret', 'Utinsky', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'who', 'Philippine', 'Resistance', 'tries', 'get', 'ever-important', 'medicine', 'POW', 'Meant', 'heighten', 'drama', 'romantically', 'involved', 'senior', 'captured', 'officer', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'love', 'story', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'due', 'long-distance', 'nature.Of', 'minor', 'importance', 'casual', 'viewers', 'fascinating', 'anyone', 'interested', '40', 'era', 'history', 'period', 'black-and-white', 'footage', 'used', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'transitioning', 'smoothly', 'rest', 'movie', 'opening', 'closing', 'are', 'filmed', 'black-and-white.In', 'general', 'like', 'war', 'films', 'even', 'such', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'what', 'be', 'gratuitous', 'gore', 'Though', 'not', 'as', 'bloody', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'war', 'film', 'Great', 'Raid', 'R-rating', 'solely', 'violence', 'times', 'incredibly', 'shocking', 'true', 'what', 'say', 'war', 'Hell', 'important', 'be', 'reminded', 'time', 'time']",N/A

It is frankly perplexing to read the minority of reviews here that criticize the film. I'm not sure where anybody is coming from who says that it was boring, poorly written and directed, wooden acting, etc.,ad nauseam.They must have the typically adolescent mentalities and sensitivities of average American viewers. They are the ones who probably thought that ConAir and its ilk were well done. As far as I'm concerned, this film ranks well on my list of favorite war films, right up there with Private Ryan.By the way, for the numbskulls who think that Spielberg is invincible, check out the scene where theG.I.s throw three or four grenades into the tank. Guess what, none of them explode though the pins were clearly pulled. Moreover, though Tom Hanks is a very good actor, he just doesn't have the masculinity for such fare. He should stick to low brow comedies like the one where he is stranded in an airport.For those who have mature tastes and sensibilities in film, they should visit Rotten Tomatoes.com to see how idiotic most of the reviewers there are in trashing the movie. The majority of those reviewers who didn't like the film were reviewers from po-dunk newspapers. The top reviewers liked it a lot.If you want to watch a movie that is much less than the sum of its parts, see Hamburger Hill to view a film that was not well written and filled with stereotypes. God bless John Dahl and his screenwriter. Benjamin Bratt and James Franco were quite believable, as was Joseph Fiennes and the supporting cast.The addition of the sub-plot involving Connie Nielson was also quite well done.

Such was the case in World War II when Washington more or less ignored the imprisonment of hundreds of GIs after the Japanese attacked and took over the Philippines.  This is their story as excerpted from the novels 'Ghost Soldiers' and 'The Great Raid on Cabanatuan'.The action of the movie takes place over five days in January 1945 during which time a battalion of Army Rangers finally lead a successful raid on the POW camp in Cabanatuan to free the remaining American prisoners after their survival of the Bataan Death March and three years of beastly, brutal incarceration.  The leaders of the raid are portrayed by Benjamin Bratt and James Franco and the survivors in the camp to be freed are held together by the characters portrayed by Joseph Fiennes, Marton Csokas and Logan Marshall-Green.  Flashbacks to the period of time before the Death March are inserted to introduce those freedom fighters lead by Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen) whose smuggling of medicine into the camp helped save the lives of her lover (Joseph Fiennes) and the others.  This story is history so the ending is not a secret.  The Rangers exhibit great bravery and succeed in the impossible mission of freeing the prisoners, with the important help of the Philippine military led by Captain Pajota (Cesar Montano), in a truly synchronous  mission.The film is very understated for the most part: real life black and white photographs of the events in the film are inserted to add credibility and they are gut wrenching.  The devastation of battle is not ignored, but the attention is focused on the very human plights of the victims and their freedom soldiers.  The film is shot in the muted tones of sepia with enough color to make the effect appear as an old 1940s movie.  It works.  Though the script is not great, the message is and the actors committed to this retelling of an important event do a fine job. John Dahl directs with a sense of pathos and while there are no raging overblown heroes, he allows the simple men involved in this story to stand taller than most heroes of the 'big war movies'.The film met with disinterest and criticism when released.

Darling,"[7, 17]","""The Great Raid"" is no ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Thin Red Line"", but it tells an important story revolving around a much over-looked theater of WWII.Although there are some horrific scenes of what the Japanese did to their American captives, I think the atrocities are depicted in a slightly watered-down manner. Becasue I felt it ""held back"" a little, it was a less impactful film for me, personally. From what I have read about the subject, it was pretty gruesome. But If the film's purpose was to re-tell history - and not too graphically - then fine. It did an OK job.The biggest problem/s I have with this movie is that it is very slow-moving, and the characters are rather one-dimensional. I want to hate the guts of the Japanese commandant, but he is such a cartoon character that I look upon him with indifference. Likewise, I want to get to know the American G.I.'s and Rangers. But, again, their characters are never really developed. They're boring people in a bland clich&eacute;-filled environment.I was expecting the film to begin with a depiction of the American's gallant but ill-fated stand while, trapped on the Island with no help coming, followed by some scenes of the grim ""Bataan Death March"". But, instead we get a fast-forward of actual news reel footage that doesn't really do the job of introducing the story very well. There's also a very thin (and fictional) romantic sub-plot involving a Dutch nurse, who works with the Philippino underground, and one of the POW's. It never really matures or has much of a place in the film other than an occasional reference during conversations amongst some POW's. The ""token romance"", if you will, that attempts to breathe some emotion into the film. But, it falls way short.The best part of the film was the last 20 minutes or so - the raid itself. It was well done with good action. It's what earned the film three stars from me.In summary... ""The Great Raid"" is a WWII film that doesn't quite fall into the same league of epic war film as ""Private Ryan"" or ""Glory"". Too bad. It tells an important story and deserved the same quality production.",3,"Not the greatest, but not bad either...",1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,2113,"['Great', 'Raid', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'important', 'story', 'revolving', 'much', 'over-looked', 'theater', 'WWII.Although', 'are', 'horrific', 'scenes', 'what', 'Japanese', 'did', 'American', 'captives', 'think', 'atrocities', 'are', 'depicted', 'slightly', 'watered-down', 'manner', 'Becasue', 'felt', 'held', 'back', 'little', 'was', 'less', 'impactful', 'film', 'personally', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'subject', 'was', 'pretty', 'gruesome', 'film', 'purpose', 'was', 're-tell', 'history', 'not', 'too', 'graphically', 'then', 'fine', 'did', 'OK', 'job.The', 'biggest', 'problem/s', 'have', 'movie', 'very', 'slow-moving', 'characters', 'are', 'rather', 'one-dimensional', 'want', 'hate', 'guts', 'Japanese', 'commandant', 'such', 'cartoon', 'character', 'look', 'indifference', 'Likewise', 'want', 'get', 'know', 'American', 'G.I', 'Rangers', 'again', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'developed', ""'re"", 'boring', 'people', 'bland', 'clich', 'eacute', '-filled', 'environment.I', 'was', 'expecting', 'film', 'begin', 'depiction', 'American', 'gallant', 'ill-fated', 'stand', 'trapped', 'Island', 'help', 'coming', 'followed', 'scenes', 'grim', 'Bataan', 'Death', 'March', 'instead', 'get', 'fast-forward', 'actual', 'news', 'reel', 'footage', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'job', 'introducing', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'also', 'very', 'thin', 'fictional', 'romantic', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'Dutch', 'nurse', 'who', 'Philippino', 'underground', 'one', 'POW', 'never', 'really', 'much', 'place', 'film', 'other', 'occasional', 'reference', 'conversations', 'amongst', 'POW', 'token', 'romance', 'will', 'breathe', 'emotion', 'film', 'way', 'short.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'raid', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'good', 'action', 'what', 'earned', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'me.In', 'summary', 'Great', 'Raid', 'WWII', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fall', 'same', 'league', 'epic', 'war', 'film', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Glory', 'Too', 'bad', 'important', 'story', 'deserved', 'same', 'quality', 'production']",N/A

946584,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B000BOH8UA,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[67, 68]","Following in the tradition of such great World War II films as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Patton"", ""The Great Raid"" tells the true story of an American rescue mission that took place over five days in January, 1945.  Cabanatuan prison was located some thirty miles behind Japanese lines.  Inside its walls were over 500 American prisoners.  Many were survivors of the Bataan death march.  These men had been improsoned for over three years.  Many began to feel that their country had left them behind.By late 1944, the Americans had returned to the Philippines.  After learning about the existance of Cabanatuan, the Americans devised a plan to send an elite group of Army Rangers in to resue the POWs.  Lt. Col. Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt), commander of the 6th Ranger Batallion, was given the assignment of developing the mission.  Captain Robert Prince (James Franco) was placed in charge of planning and actually carrying out the raid.  The Rangers would have to travel thirty miles into enemy-held territory, much of the time in broad daylight with very little cover.  Fortunately, they received a great deal of help from the Filipino resistance.Once at the camp, the Rangers burst through the front gate, suppressing the Japanese with heavy rifle fire, knocking out strongpoints and vehicles, and going through each building until every prisoner was accounted for.  Many could not walk on their own, so the Rangers carried them to saftey. Once safely outside of the camp, Filipios using carabou carts helped transport the prisoners to American lines and freedom.  In the end, 511 prisoners were rescued at the cost of only two Rangers who were killed in action.  Major Daniel Gibson (Joseph Fiennes) was the ranking American officer in the camp.  It is through his eyes that the viewer experiences the horrors of camp life.  Included are the numerous beatings, attempted escapes, and other atrocities which the Japanese placed upon the Americans.  Gibson died soon after being liberated.Mucci and Prince were both awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for valor.  Although this mission had very little strategic value to the actual fighting of the war, the rescue of these prisoners remains one of the bright parts of the war.  These men felt deserted by their country, but in the end, it was American soldiers, risking their own lives, who saved them.I've been a fan of true stories for a long time, and this movie ranks as one of the best true stories I've seen.  Bratt and Franco give excellent performances as the colorful Mucci and the tough-as-nails Prince.  Connie Nielsen is very good as Margaret Utinsky, a nurse who stayed behind in Manila after its fall to the Japanese.  She smuggled much-needed medical supplies to the prisoners, risking her own life in the process.  The extras included on the DVD are excellent as well.  The documentary ""The Ghosts of Bataan"" gives an up-close look at the death march itself, while author Hampton Sides, who wrote the fine book ""Ghost Soldiers"", provides a history lesson about the raid.I give this movie my highest recommendation. This is one of the best war films ever made.  It is historically accurate, and the acting is excellent from start to finish.  Watch and see how a group of 120 determined American soldiers marched thirty miles behind enemy lines to free a group of POWs who felt abandoned by their country.",5,"Left Behind, But Never Forgotten",1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,3378,"['Following', 'tradition', 'such', 'great', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'films', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Patton', 'Great', 'Raid', 'true', 'story', 'American', 'rescue', 'mission', 'took', 'place', 'five', 'days', 'January', '1945', 'Cabanatuan', 'prison', 'was', 'located', 'thirty', 'miles', 'Japanese', 'lines', 'walls', 'were', 'over', '500', 'American', 'prisoners', 'Many', 'were', 'survivors', 'Bataan', 'death', 'march', 'men', 'had', 'been', 'improsoned', 'three', 'years', 'Many', 'began', 'feel', 'country', 'had', 'left', 'behind.By', 'late', '1944', 'Americans', 'had', 'returned', 'Philippines', 'learning', 'existance', 'Cabanatuan', 'Americans', 'devised', 'plan', 'send', 'elite', 'group', 'Army', 'Rangers', 'resue', 'POWs', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Henry', 'Mucci', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'commander', '6th', 'Ranger', 'Batallion', 'was', 'given', 'assignment', 'developing', 'mission', 'Captain', 'Robert', 'Prince', 'James', 'Franco', 'was', 'placed', 'charge', 'planning', 'actually', 'carrying', 'out', 'raid', 'Rangers', 'would', 'have', 'travel', 'thirty', 'miles', 'enemy-held', 'territory', 'much', 'time', 'broad', 'daylight', 'very', 'little', 'cover', 'Fortunately', 'received', 'great', 'deal', 'help', 'Filipino', 'resistance.Once', 'camp', 'Rangers', 'burst', 'front', 'gate', 'suppressing', 'Japanese', 'heavy', 'rifle', 'fire', 'knocking', 'out', 'strongpoints', 'vehicles', 'going', 'building', 'prisoner', 'was', 'accounted', 'Many', 'could', 'not', 'walk', 'own', 'Rangers', 'carried', 'saftey', 'Once', 'safely', 'camp', 'Filipios', 'using', 'carabou', 'carts', 'helped', 'transport', 'prisoners', 'American', 'lines', 'freedom', 'end', '511', 'prisoners', 'were', 'rescued', 'cost', 'only', 'two', 'Rangers', 'who', 'were', 'killed', 'action', 'Major', 'Daniel', 'Gibson', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'was', 'ranking', 'American', 'officer', 'camp', 'eyes', 'viewer', 'horrors', 'camp', 'life', 'Included', 'are', 'numerous', 'beatings', 'attempted', 'escapes', 'other', 'atrocities', 'Japanese', 'placed', 'Americans', 'Gibson', 'died', 'soon', 'being', 'liberated.Mucci', 'Prince', 'were', 'awarded', 'Distinguished', 'Service', 'Cross', 'valor', 'mission', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'strategic', 'value', 'actual', 'fighting', 'war', 'rescue', 'prisoners', 'one', 'bright', 'parts', 'war', 'men', 'felt', 'deserted', 'country', 'end', 'was', 'American', 'soldiers', 'risking', 'own', 'lives', 'who', 'saved', 'them.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'true', 'stories', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'true', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Bratt', 'Franco', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'colorful', 'Mucci', 'tough-as-nails', 'Prince', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'very', 'good', 'Margaret', 'Utinsky', 'nurse', 'who', 'stayed', 'Manila', 'fall', 'Japanese', 'smuggled', 'much-needed', 'medical', 'supplies', 'prisoners', 'risking', 'own', 'life', 'process', 'extras', 'included', 'DVD', 'are', 'excellent', 'well', 'documentary', 'Ghosts', 'Bataan', 'up-close', 'look', 'death', 'march', 'author', 'Hampton', 'Sides', 'who', 'wrote', 'fine', 'book', 'Ghost', 'Soldiers', 'history', 'lesson', 'raid.I', 'give', 'movie', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'one', 'best', 'war', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'historically', 'accurate', 'acting', 'excellent', 'start', 'finish', 'Watch', 'see', 'how', 'group', '120', 'determined', 'American', 'soldiers', 'marched', 'thirty', 'miles', 'enemy', 'lines', 'free', 'group', 'POWs', 'who', 'felt', 'abandoned', 'country']",N/A

Determined not to let this happen to the 511 soldiers held at Cabanatuan, Lt. Colonel Mucci and Capt. Prince devised a daring plan to sneak in ahead of the advancing troops and rescue the POWs.  Based on the true story as detailed in the book ""Ghost Soldiers,"" it's an exciting and heart-breaking tale.  And while it's been a couple of years since I read the book, it seemed that the movie followed rather closely to the true story, although I don't remember the ""love story"" between POW Major Gibson and the civilian Margaret in Manila.Overall, a good and inspiring movie, although the acting by Benjamin Bratt and James Franco comes across as suprisingly unemotional.  The look of the movie is very effective as well, with much of it looking somewhat faded and washed-out, and the use of original black & white film clips was especially effective.  And in spite of the over-the-top violence shown in some recent war movies, it is rather restrained here, although a few scenes of executions by the Japanese soldiers are shown in gut-wrenching detail.  But this isn't the main agenda of the movie, as the Japanese atrocities (as detailed in the book) are limited in their portrayal here.

(Let's ignore such harmless scriptwriters' fantasies as TOP GUN, STEALTH, GI JANE, HEARTBREAK RIDGE, and their ilk.) How many can you think of in the past half-dozen years? SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, WE WERE SOLDIERS, BLACKHAWK DOWN, and the TV miniseries BAND OF BROTHERS. Now, with our troops currently bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan with indifferent media coverage reporting only deaths by suicide bombers, we have THE GREAT RAID, based on a true World War II incident.After the fall of Corregidor to the Japanese in 1942, tens of thousands of U.S. troops were herded off to captivity on the shameful Bataan Death March. Those that survived the trek languished in POW camps such as Cabanatuan, which contained 500+ prisoners in January 1945, by which time MacArthur was recapturing Philippine real estate. A battalion of Army Rangers was tasked with rescuing the Cabanatuan inmates. THE GREAT RAID is the story of that mission.One notable feature of this film is that it and the audience are not overwhelmed by the presence of superstars which steal the show. Rather, its cast is made up of relative unknowns (at least to me) portraying professional fighters going about their business. Joseph Fiennes plays the malaria-ridden Major Gibson, the senior American officer in Cabanatuan, Motoki Kobayashi as Gibson's head jailer, the venomous Major Nagai, and Benjamin Bratt as Lt. Colonel Mucci, the commander of the Ranger rescue force. Also very effective is Connie Nielsen as Margaret Utinsky, the widow of a deceased American officer and a nurse marooned for the war in Manila, where she works at a hospital and with the Filipino underground to smuggle much needed medicines to the POWs and (especially) to her pre-war boyfriend, Gibson.Director John Dahl is to be commended for giving due credit to the armed Filipino resistance, led here by Capt. Juan Pajota (Cesar Montano), who fought alongside the Rangers and played a crucial support role in the daring raid. Also, the ending credits include (what I presume to be) archival news footage of the evacuation and return home of the real Cabanatuan survivors - footage that gives history a face.As an aside, Lt. General Kreuger, who ordered the rescue mission, is portrayed by ex-Marine officer Dale Dye, who has a weekend talk show on radio KFI in Los Angeles. Dye, who some might say pontificates on-air about military matters at a level above his last active duty rank (Captain, Officer Grade O-3), played an Army Colonel in BAND OF BROTHERS. Wow, O-6 to O-9 in four years! Gee, perhaps Cap'n Dale will make 5 stars in his next Big Screen appearance.THE GREAT RAID will not play well in Japan. In the first few minutes, Japanese troops are shown forcing American POWs into air raid shelters, which are then flooded with gasoline and torched. Any burning Yanks trying to escape the inferno were shot. This, too, is ostensibly based on a true incident.

946593,A1TKM36EYEQNSM,B000BOH8UA,Joseph J. Slevin,"[3, 4]","The first thing I want to say is that this movie does not glorfy war.  I was also glad that this movie was not a 'Saving Private Ryan/Thin Red Line' type of production.  It was a drama, a movie in the 1960s or 70s type or style.  It had more of a look and feel of a 'Patton,' ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" or ""Longest Day"" to it, not like the 'Battle of the Buldge' though.The story itself was gripping enough, only five days to extract over 500 prisoners who were destined to die at the hands of their captors who wished to kill them because they viewed them as animals.I think the movie also gave a lot of lessons around one of the most ignored areas of World War II.  The Phillipines has mostly been ignored in movies about that epic in history.  This movie covers that part of the war in an overview fashion, even with a bit of a documentary at the beginning.The DVD has some great historical extras like the interactive timeline of the whole war and interviews of some of those who were involved in the great raid.  The Captain Dale Dye piece was also informative on how the movie was made and the training that the actors had to go through in a bootcamp setting for over two weeks.I really liked the story of sacrifice for men who were left to basically rot for a myriad of reasons by the US.  Really, there was no Navy to save them or to get to them since the first attacks of the Phillipines were just days after Pearl Harbor.  The fact that there were so many fighting men that languished in Corregador and main island of the Phillipines was almost appalling.  Most of the men died on the way to the prison camps in what is known as the Bataan Death March.  This alone, the history, is worth the whole time watching the movie.  Since there is no gore, kids could watch it without too much difficulty.I think the thing that got to me the most was seeing the footage of the real heroes and survivors of the raid and of the captives.  It was very touching to see video of what happened to them after they were freed.  To say the least, this was a very well done movie and since it was done in more of an old fashion way, the lessons learned and the desire and drive of all of the men and women involved makes for a huge lesson in sacrifice for your fellow man.The movie has three main locations it focuses on:  The capital of Manila, where the underground was fighting its fight, the prison camp where the prisoners were trying to stay alive fighting disease and deprivation, and with the soldiers who were their saviors from the beach head to the eventual attack and extraction at the camp.There is a lot of history covered in this great film.  Worth it for the whole family to watch since there are heroes and heroines.This definately rates among the top of the movies in my collection.Joe Slevin",5,Thought provoking movie with a great history lesson,1174694400,"03 24, 2007",2007,2793,"['first', 'thing', 'want', 'say', 'movie', 'not', 'glorfy', 'war', 'was', 'also', 'glad', 'movie', 'was', 'not', ""'Saving"", 'Private', 'Ryan/Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'type', 'production', 'was', 'drama', 'movie', '1960s', '70s', 'type', 'style', 'had', 'more', 'look', 'feel', ""'Patton"", 'Tora', 'Tora', 'Tora', 'Longest', 'Day', 'not', ""'Battle"", 'Buldge', 'though.The', 'story', 'was', 'gripping', 'enough', 'only', 'five', 'days', 'extract', '500', 'prisoners', 'who', 'were', 'destined', 'die', 'hands', 'captors', 'who', 'wished', 'kill', 'viewed', 'animals.I', 'think', 'movie', 'also', 'gave', 'lot', 'lessons', 'one', 'most', 'ignored', 'areas', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Phillipines', 'mostly', 'been', 'ignored', 'movies', 'epic', 'history', 'movie', 'part', 'war', 'overview', 'fashion', 'even', 'bit', 'documentary', 'beginning.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'historical', 'extras', 'interactive', 'timeline', 'whole', 'war', 'interviews', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'great', 'raid', 'Captain', 'Dale', 'Dye', 'piece', 'was', 'also', 'informative', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'training', 'actors', 'had', 'go', 'bootcamp', 'setting', 'two', 'weeks.I', 'really', 'liked', 'story', 'sacrifice', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'left', 'basically', 'rot', 'myriad', 'reasons', 'US', 'Really', 'was', 'Navy', 'save', 'get', 'first', 'attacks', 'Phillipines', 'were', 'just', 'days', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'fact', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'fighting', 'men', 'languished', 'Corregador', 'main', 'island', 'Phillipines', 'was', 'almost', 'appalling', 'Most', 'men', 'died', 'way', 'prison', 'camps', 'what', 'known', 'Bataan', 'Death', 'March', 'alone', 'history', 'whole', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'gore', 'kids', 'could', 'watch', 'too', 'much', 'difficulty.I', 'think', 'thing', 'got', 'most', 'was', 'seeing', 'footage', 'real', 'heroes', 'survivors', 'raid', 'captives', 'was', 'very', 'touching', 'see', 'video', 'what', 'happened', 'were', 'freed', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'more', 'old', 'fashion', 'way', 'lessons', 'learned', 'desire', 'drive', 'men', 'women', 'involved', 'huge', 'lesson', 'sacrifice', 'fellow', 'man.The', 'movie', 'three', 'main', 'locations', 'capital', 'Manila', 'where', 'underground', 'was', 'fighting', 'fight', 'prison', 'camp', 'where', 'prisoners', 'were', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'fighting', 'disease', 'deprivation', 'soldiers', 'who', 'were', 'saviors', 'beach', 'head', 'eventual', 'attack', 'extraction', 'camp.There', 'lot', 'history', 'covered', 'great', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'watch', 'are', 'heroes', 'heroines.This', 'definately', 'rates', 'top', 'movies', 'collection.Joe', 'Slevin']",N/A

946600,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000BOH8UA,Kaya Savas,"[4, 13]","MOVIE: The true story of a raid on a Japanese P.O.W camp to rescue over 100 American prisoners of war sounds like a compelling movie idea.  Too bad the filmmakers turned it into a piece of propaganda.  War films are always going to be around because the topic of war has been and always will be a part of society.  However, it's hard to strike gold in this genre because the story needs to be real and gritty yet needs to be accessible by the general public.  This movie throws the idea of being ""real and gritty"" right out the window.  The movie is polished clean with cliched characters and a cliched plot.  We have a prisoner who has been in the P.O.W camp for three years played wonderfully by Jospeh Fiennes . . . ready for the cliche?  He is in love with a women outside who is part of the underground movement by smuggling drugs to the prisoners to treat them.  We then have the men who have been assembled to participate in the raid.  Benjamin Bratt gives a very dry performance, and so does James Franco.  The soldiers are very one dimensional and feel like they have been plucked right out of past war films.  The only compelling part of this film are the scenes within the P.O.W camp, the scenes showing how the prisoners deal with day to day life in the camp are moving.  The film is also beautifully shot and superbly edited.  The cinematography was excellent in my opinion, and the Oscar winning Pietro Scalia did a fantatsic job editing the picture.  However, the script is very weak, and there seems to be no direction.  We have two stories here; the story of the P.O.W camp and underground movement, and the story of the soldiers taking part in the raid.  The film never really connects these two stories together and never spends enough time on either one.  The script does not develop the characters at all.  Why not just focus on the soldiers or just focus on the P.O.W's.  The raid itself was well done though.  It wasn't an all out action war film like Black Hawk Down, but I thought the raid was done well.  Then again you have to give credit to the editing because when it comes to pacing and action you have to have good editing, which the film had.  One more downer was the score.  I have come to expect great things from composers who worked with Hans Zimmer at Media Ventures, and I have seen great things from Trevor Rabin.  Unfortunetly his score here was very dull and too subtle.  It lacked emotion and feeling, and it also lacked a solid theme.ACTING: Wooden acting for the most part.  Joseph Fiennes and Marton Csokas were the standout actors here.  I loved their performances and found them to be compelling and real.  I love Csokas as an actor because he has these perfect eyes for the job, he always acts with his eyes and I love it.BOTTOM LINE: This movie has been on the shelf for 3 years before Miramax finally released it because of the ongoing fued that Mirmax has with Disney, and the war in Iraq.  I don't think it would have made a difference if they released it then versus now.  It bombed at the box office and then fell off the chart in its second week.  The marketing for it was horrible, even that was cliched.  It was a shame to see so much talent gone to waste.

The movie doesn't just bring to light a relatively ignored event in military history but also develops the characters and adds a lot more depth than just some gunfire and bloodshed.It that lies the problem though in that the movie takes you along not just for the event but along with the lives of the people involved in the event over those 5 days. This leads to a lot of development and slow points which might tend to bore the people viewing the movie for the war and violence. It plays more like a documentary than an action flick and that really isn't what people look for in an action movie.If you're looking for a huge action oriented war epic this probably won't cut it for you, but if you're looking for a great story about a largely ignored event in World War 2 history then give this one a watch as it won't disappoint.",5,Most Underrated of 2005,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,1158,"['movie', 'one', 'biggest', 'disappointments', '2005', 'Now', 'when', 'say', 'disappointment', ""'m"", 'not', 'referring', 'quality', 'movie', 'rather', 'reception', 'received', 'release.This', 'really', 'one', 'better', 'World', 'War', '2', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'time', 'right', 'there', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'opinion', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'bring', 'light', 'relatively', 'ignored', 'event', 'military', 'history', 'also', 'characters', 'lot', 'more', 'depth', 'just', 'gunfire', 'bloodshed.It', 'problem', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'event', 'lives', 'people', 'involved', 'event', '5', 'days', 'lot', 'development', 'slow', 'points', 'might', 'tend', 'bore', 'people', 'viewing', 'movie', 'war', 'violence', 'more', 'documentary', 'action', 'flick', 'really', ""n't"", 'what', 'people', 'look', 'action', 'movie.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'huge', 'action', 'oriented', 'war', 'epic', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cut', ""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'story', 'largely', 'ignored', 'event', 'World', 'War', '2', 'history', 'then', 'give', 'one', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappoint']",N/A

I cannot pay the film or the filmakers a higher compliment than that.  Having done some research on the topic (I know what parts were fictional and what parts were real) made the experience of watching this film even more incredible.  I used it for my class for several reason.  1)  The Great Raid, chronicling life in the Phillippines under Japanese occupation, in POW camps and in the final dramatic rescue of surviving POW's by young army Rangers is simply a story that needs to be told.  2)  Most good movies about WW2 deal with Europe or the Holocaust, I wanted to show my students that a brutal war was fought in the Pacific and that the war crimes committed by the Japanese were just as horrible as those committed by the NAZI's.  3) the uncomprimising view of war was what the students needed to be riveted in their seats and to make them notice one of the truly heroic stories of WW2.  4)The inclusion of vintage footage actually brought home the point of this movie more strongly that parts of the movie itself.  It was excellent and my students greatly enjoyed it.  Yes, there are some criticisms to be made.  There was no love story between Margaret and Daniel and Margaret is really a composite of 2 women freedom fighters, but overall things movie was true to the source material (I've read both GHOST SOLDIERS & THE GREAT RAID ON CABANATUAN).

It is a bad movie not because it has tried to achieve something and has failed, but because it has tried to achieve so very little in the first place. Stock characters, hackneyed dialogue, and poor direction are not the ingredients of a good war film. War films need not be completely original and inventive to be worth watching, but if of a formulaic approach, they need to at least be exciting and well made to be successful. ""The Great Raid"" succeeds in very little other than boring its viewers. It is a typical war film of the worst kind, with no passion in its storytelling and with an execution so dull it may as well have been titled ""War Film #483.""The film is about a daring raid to free American POWs in Japanese controlled territory in the South Pacific during World War II. The battle is turning heavily in the favour of the Americans, but the fleeing enemy forces have taken to executing their remaining POWs, and a group of highly trained Americans are sent in to rescue a camp of 500. The opening to the film is very effective, with war footage and narration used to establish the story and set a historic and tense tone to the film. The first scenes of Japanese cruelty to American prisoners are also good and are perhaps the most emotionally effective scenes of the film. From there, however, it becomes clear that the film will be nothing more than one long lead up to the `great raid.' This could be effective, but the attempts to create sympathy for the characters that will fight and fall in the raid are so heavy-handed and clich&eacute;d that all effect is lost. As a result of this poor character development, by the time the rather anti-climactic finale occurs it seems of little concern who lives and who dies.One of the main problems with the film is the acting. It is poor at best. James Franco and Benjamin Bratt are ripe examples of why most television actors should stick to television. Their performances are so dull and their dialogue so forced, I could not have cared less about the characters they portray. Actors, I feel, should be able to convincingly deliver more than one emotion, a level of talent these two actors fail to achieve. The only notable actor in the film, Joseph Fiennes, is given a character so ill throughout the entire film that his performance ends up about as sickly as the others. The poorly written, clich&eacute; ridden screenplay is of no help, but these actors fail to do anything remotely interesting or watchable with the characters they are given.The story may be a great one, but this dull film fails to do it justice. The film is not without some worthwhile cinematography and an occasional watchable scene, but by the time the predictable loose-end-tying text comes up at the end of the film, I could not help but be thankful.",2,"Alternative title: ""War Film #483""",1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,2920,"['Great', 'Raid', 'film', 'so', 'standard', 'concept', 'so', 'lifeless', 'execution', 'can', 'be', 'frustrating', 'times', 'watch', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'tried', 'achieve', 'something', 'failed', 'tried', 'achieve', 'so', 'very', 'little', 'first', 'place', 'Stock', 'characters', 'hackneyed', 'dialogue', 'poor', 'direction', 'are', 'not', 'ingredients', 'good', 'war', 'film', 'War', 'films', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'completely', 'original', 'inventive', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'formulaic', 'approach', 'need', 'least', 'be', 'exciting', 'well', 'made', 'be', 'successful', 'Great', 'Raid', 'very', 'little', 'other', 'boring', 'viewers', 'typical', 'war', 'film', 'worst', 'kind', 'passion', 'storytelling', 'execution', 'so', 'dull', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'titled', 'War', 'Film', '483', 'film', 'daring', 'raid', 'free', 'American', 'POWs', 'Japanese', 'controlled', 'territory', 'South', 'Pacific', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'battle', 'turning', 'heavily', 'favour', 'Americans', 'fleeing', 'enemy', 'forces', 'have', 'taken', 'executing', 'remaining', 'POWs', 'group', 'highly', 'trained', 'Americans', 'are', 'sent', 'rescue', 'camp', '500', 'opening', 'film', 'very', 'effective', 'war', 'footage', 'narration', 'used', 'establish', 'story', 'set', 'historic', 'tense', 'tone', 'film', 'first', 'scenes', 'Japanese', 'cruelty', 'American', 'prisoners', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'are', 'perhaps', 'most', 'emotionally', 'effective', 'scenes', 'film', 'there', 'however', 'clear', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'one', 'long', 'lead', 'up', 'great', 'raid', 'could', 'be', 'effective', 'attempts', 'create', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'will', 'fight', 'fall', 'raid', 'are', 'so', 'heavy-handed', 'clich', 'eacute', 'effect', 'lost', 'result', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'time', 'rather', 'anti-climactic', 'finale', 'little', 'concern', 'who', 'who', 'dies.One', 'main', 'problems', 'film', 'acting', 'poor', 'best', 'James', 'Franco', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'are', 'ripe', 'examples', 'why', 'most', 'television', 'actors', 'should', 'stick', 'television', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'dull', 'dialogue', 'so', 'forced', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'characters', 'portray', 'Actors', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'convincingly', 'deliver', 'more', 'one', 'emotion', 'level', 'talent', 'two', 'actors', 'fail', 'achieve', 'only', 'notable', 'actor', 'film', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'given', 'character', 'so', 'ill', 'entire', 'film', 'performance', 'up', 'about', 'as', 'sickly', 'others', 'poorly', 'written', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ridden', 'screenplay', 'help', 'actors', 'fail', 'do', 'anything', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'watchable', 'characters', 'are', 'given.The', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'one', 'dull', 'film', 'fails', 'do', 'justice', 'film', 'not', 'worthwhile', 'cinematography', 'occasional', 'watchable', 'scene', 'time', 'predictable', 'loose-end-tying', 'text', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'thankful']",N/A

But in this movie, the director cut out the ONLY action scene in the first half of the movie.Maybe this scene wasn't really important in the grand scheme of things, but why did they take out the scene where Connie Nielsen gets ambushed by Filipinos and Japanese?  That scene defined the movie a little bit better by showing what kind of work Nielsen did in her free time, and it also showed that some Filipinos cooperated with the Japanese.Overall, I liked this movie a lot, but I really didn't like the scenes depicting the prisoners.

946610,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000BOH8UA,Linda Linguvic,"[2, 2]","This little-known war film was actually produced in 2002 but, because of 911, was not released until 2005 with little fanfare and little publicity.  It's based on the true story of how American and Philippine troops rescued 500 American soldiers who were imprisoned by the Japanese after the Bataan death march.  This was one of the horrors of WWII in which 70,000 American troops were captured by the Japanese and forced to march 63 miles to terrible prison camps.  Most of the American soldiers died on the march and the rest were held captive till the end of the war.  Then, when the Japanese realized they were losing the war, they started killing the prisoners and in one awful scene we see them forcing the Americans into trenches, pouring gasoline on them, and then burning them to death.The film focuses on one particular prison camp that held 500 American soldiers.  We all know that these soldiers will be murdered if they are not rescued, and this is where the American Rangers and Philippine guerillas come in.  Make no mistake - this is not a war film that is filled with special effects, bright colors and quick shots of the wounded.  This film feels more like the real thing, especially since the director has chosen to use desaturated colors in many of the scenes which give the film the feel of a 1940s film.  It is also not politically correct, as it doesn't humanize the Japanese; they are ""bad guys"" throughout the entire film.Acting is excellent.  The only actor I was familiar with was Joseph Fiennes, cast in the role of a Malaria-ridden captive officer, but without exception, all of the other characters seemed real, with an authenticity rare in films these days.  It might have seemed slow to some, but a lot of time was spent in the planning of the raid.  We learned every single detail of the painstaking plan, including the roles of individual American soldiers and Philippine guerillas.  We also experience the general horror of the Japanese occupation of the Philippines and true heroism that resulted in the final rescue of the prisoners.  Also, as the credits rolled at the end, there was archival footage of the prisoners being saved.  The result was chilling and inspiring.For lovers of history and war film buffs like me, I recommend this film.

946615,A1Y87E22UVYCE6,B000BOH8UA,"Maximiliano F Yofre ""Maxi""","[2, 3]","""The Great Raid"" (2005) wasn't a great box office success. That's a sad surprise! This is a very good film. Director John Dahl, with only nine films in his curricula (mostly crime films) has delivered his best film up to today. His rhythm sense is very acute and follows at least three converging threads: the rescue party, the POW camp and the Filipino resistance movement. All of them add to the general plot without distracting spectator's attention.The story is based on real facts. As notices arrive to GHQ that POWs are being massacred by their Japanese captor; a Rangers rescue party is launched in a critic path. The movie narrates the forming and marching, deep into enemy lines, of the rescue column. It describes the everyday life at the POW camp, with all the inmates nearing starvation and in horrible humanitarian conditions.  Last but not least shows the Filipino underground movement helping the POWs with medicines, providing the USA Army with information and harassing the fleeing Japanese forces.Movie's climax arrives naturally, without tricks, yet transmitting all the tension and vibration of the epic!Playacting is restrained without over dramatization. Joseph Finnes (""Shakespeare in Love) portrays POW's leading Officer Maj. Gibson; Connie Nielsen (""Gladiator"") impersonates Margaret Utinsky a resistance leader; Benjamin Bratt as Lt. Col. Mucci, Max Martini as 1st Sgt. Wojo and James Franco as Capt. Prince complete the cast.Japanese actors Masa Yamaguchi as Lt. Hikobe, Ken Senga as Col. Mori and Motoki Kobayashi as Maj. Nagai give a very realistic representation, far from usual stereotypes.It is a gripping movie that gives no respite to the audience.

946619,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000BOH8UA,mirasreviews,"[3, 7]","""The Great Raid"" recounts the story of the biggest rescue mission in U.S. military history, which took place in January 1945 in the Philippines. In 1941, Imperial Japan invaded the Philippines. 70,000 American and Philippine troops resisted the invasion, but eventually surrendered in what was the biggest surrender in U.S. military history. Those who survived where placed in brutal Japanese POW camps, where they were not expected to survive. Although aided by the Philippine underground, the troops were given a low priority by the U.S, military, which was focusing its efforts on Europe. Eventually, the tide of the war in the Pacific changed, and the U.S. set out to rescue some of the American POW's before they died at the hands of the Japanese. ""The Great Raid"" picks up the story at this point.Lt. Colonel Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt), in command of the 6th Ranger Battalion, is given the task of carrying out the seemingly impossible rescue of approximately 500 American POWs being held in the Cabanatuan POW Camp. Captain Robert Prince (James Franco), who narrates the film, plans the raid. The raid would be strategically insignificant, even foolish. It may have been motivated by a desire to do the right thing, or by sentimentality, or by guilt at having abandoned thousands of American soldiers to abominable conditions for 3 years. In any case, it would be a remarkable accomplishment if it succeeded. The films shifts between 3 perspectives on the POW story: The plight of prisoners in the camp and their ranking officer Major Daniel Gibson (Joseph Fiennes). A nurse named Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen) in Manila, who is involved with smuggling medical supplies to POWs. And Lt. Colonel Mucci and his men as they coordinate with the Philippine guerilla forces under the command of Captain Juan Pajota (Cesar Montano).""The Great Raid"" is a dull film about an interesting subject. People are being tortured and murdered left and right, and it nearly lulled me to sleep. Director John Dahl manages to impress upon the audience that the Japanese are doing bad things, but completely fails to convey the enormous stress and terror under which the POWs and their allies lived. ""The Great Raid"" just never engages emotionally. The raid, itself, is exciting but comes late in the film.  I have to give the film credit for bringing this story to my attention, but not for telling it well. The only character who really makes an impression is Capt. Pajota, who is portrayed as extremely competent and indispensible. ""The Great Raid"" is based on the books ""The Great Raid on Cabanatuan"" by William Breuer and ""Ghost Soldiers"" by Hampton Sides. The film is a nice intro to the history, but it's weak.The DVD (Miramax 2005): Bonus features include 8 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, 4 featurettes, an interactive time line, and an audio commentary. ""The Price of Freedom: Making the Great Raid"" (19 min) is a meandering documentary featuring interviews with director John Dahl, military advisor Dale Dye, author Hampton Sides, some of the cast, some veterans of the real events depicted in the film, et al. It mostly discusses the history behind the story and filming the raid itself. ""Captain Dale Dye's Boot Camp"" (8 min) is about the training that the actors went through, under the tutelage of former Marine Dale Dye, to learn how to be soldiers. ""Sound Design"" consists of a featurette that goes into a lot of detail about mixing the sound (10 min) and a ""Mix Board"" that allows you to hear any of 6 sound channels for a 3-minute segment of the film as well as the full mix. ""The Veterans Remember"" (8 min) features interviews with veterans of the actual events of the film, including Robert Prince, in which they talk about their experiences and how they feel about them. ""War in the Pacific: Interactive Time Line"" allows you to navigate a time line of the events leading up the war in the Pacific, through the war, to it's aftermath. Blurbs about the events are written by William B. Breuer and audio clips are by Hampton Sides. The audio commentary is by director John Dahl, producer Marty Katz, technical advisor Dale Dye, editor Scott Chestnut, and author Hampton Sides. There are some comments about filming in Australia, but it primarily provides additional historical details of the events in the film.

Benjamin Bratt has an eerie physical resemblance to the man in charge of the rescue attempt, although it is difficult to tell if Bratt's brooding style is more Bratt or his character. The three largest heroes of the film are at the next level: the junior officer who plans the mission, the female American nurse who kept the prisoners alive through their years in captivity, and her unrequited beloved, the commanding American officer in the camp.Retired Marine and professional film advisor Dale Dye appears again as a senior officer who sets the mission in motion in the Philippines on very short notice in January 1945. The odds for the small number of well-trained but wholly untested rescuers are pretty grim but not nearly as grim as the odds facing the prisoners, who have to each day struggle simply to survive and estimate the odds of an escape effort versus a most certain death at the hands of their captors. After three years, it could only have been the most resilient and the most cynical that could have lived through the experience.The film makes the Japanese as cruel as anyone could imagine. The Filipino guerillas get scant attention yet played a major role in keeping the prisoners alive, pestering the Japanese conquerors for years at great risk to themselves, and aiding the great raid. Bratt treats his Filipino comrades almost with disdain and his right-hand man, the Stanford ROTC officer who plans the brilliant rescue, feels the same sense of distance from his boss.Scenes depicting life in the camp and under occupation in Manila are slow yet provide much of the tension and build up for the climax. When it comes, the raid moves swiftly, with more fire and confusion than focus, and the screenplay gives way too much credence and heroic credit to the sadistic camp commander's one-man effort to thwart the raid.The sad fact is that this is a long, sad chapter in history, and an even sadder commentary about man's inhumanity to man. Despite the brilliance of the plan's formulation and execution, most of the film is one unrelenting, repressing catalog of tension, cruelty and barbarism, despite the absence of Tarantino-like gore.",4,"A brief, happy conclusion to a long, miserable story",1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,2325,"['Having', 'read', 'reviewed', 'one', 'impressive', 'books', 'basis', 'film', 'Ghost', 'soldiers', 'knew', 'where', 'were', 'going', 'opening', 'credits', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'eerie', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'man', 'charge', 'rescue', 'attempt', 'difficult', 'tell', 'Bratt', 'brooding', 'style', 'more', 'Bratt', 'character', 'three', 'largest', 'heroes', 'film', 'are', 'next', 'level', 'junior', 'officer', 'who', 'mission', 'female', 'American', 'nurse', 'who', 'kept', 'prisoners', 'alive', 'years', 'captivity', 'unrequited', 'beloved', 'commanding', 'American', 'officer', 'camp.Retired', 'Marine', 'professional', 'film', 'advisor', 'Dale', 'Dye', 'again', 'senior', 'officer', 'who', 'mission', 'motion', 'Philippines', 'very', 'short', 'notice', 'January', '1945', 'odds', 'small', 'number', 'well-trained', 'wholly', 'untested', 'rescuers', 'are', 'pretty', 'grim', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'grim', 'odds', 'facing', 'prisoners', 'who', 'have', 'day', 'struggle', 'simply', 'survive', 'estimate', 'odds', 'escape', 'effort', 'most', 'certain', 'death', 'hands', 'captors', 'three', 'years', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'resilient', 'most', 'cynical', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'experience.The', 'film', 'Japanese', 'as', 'cruel', 'anyone', 'could', 'imagine', 'Filipino', 'guerillas', 'get', 'scant', 'attention', 'yet', 'played', 'major', 'role', 'keeping', 'prisoners', 'alive', 'pestering', 'Japanese', 'conquerors', 'years', 'great', 'risk', 'aiding', 'great', 'raid', 'Bratt', 'Filipino', 'almost', 'disdain', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Stanford', 'ROTC', 'officer', 'who', 'brilliant', 'rescue', 'same', 'sense', 'distance', 'boss.Scenes', 'depicting', 'life', 'camp', 'occupation', 'Manila', 'are', 'slow', 'yet', 'provide', 'much', 'tension', 'build', 'up', 'climax', 'When', 'raid', 'swiftly', 'more', 'fire', 'confusion', 'focus', 'screenplay', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'credence', 'heroic', 'credit', 'sadistic', 'camp', 'commander', 'one-man', 'effort', 'thwart', 'raid.The', 'sad', 'fact', 'long', 'sad', 'chapter', 'history', 'even', 'sadder', 'commentary', 'man', 'inhumanity', 'man', 'brilliance', 'plan', 'formulation', 'execution', 'most', 'film', 'one', 'unrelenting', 'repressing', 'catalog', 'tension', 'cruelty', 'barbarism', 'absence', 'Tarantino-like', 'gore']",N/A

946630,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B000BOH8UA,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[11, 12]","THE GREAT RAID begins and ends with documentary newsreel of the US military involvement in the Philippines during World War II.  The proceeding scene of the film shows a most highly emotional scene that portrays an act of aggression by the Japanese army toward the POWs.  The scene is suggestive of the horrific experiences that US soldiers as well as Philippine and American civilian POWs had to endure during the Pacific conflict.  The film is an historical narrative about the US military POWs at the Japanese POW camp at Cabanatuan and their successful rescue by the US 6th Ranger Battalion.  This was a most heroic and historical event that occurred in January 1945 that not only involved 121 US Army Rangers, but an essential effort in terms of manpower and medical assistance from the Philippine guerillas and the Philippine underground that helped aid in the effort in saving over 512 POWs from the hands of the Japanese army.  This film puts the Philippine involvement in the war in perspective.Hollywood tends to romanticize history.  However, the GREAT RAID stays true to the historical record, and does not editorialize on the event.  The film may bear similarities to war films of the past in that it emphasizes the content and context of the storyline that involves the duty of the soldier and the completion of their mission regardless of the consequences.  However, this is not a film about ""guts and glory.""  The only element of the film that appears somewhat disconnected is the suggestive romance between Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes) and Margaret Utinsky (Connie Neilsen); it offers a soft and sentimental intermission from the war scenes despite the horror of war - war is not pretty.Overall, THE GREAT RAID is a highly recommended film.  It is not like any other war film that has been released pertaining to World War II.  One may compare it Private Ryan or Bridge Over the River Kwai, but this is a film that stands by itself due to the particular event, the place, the people, and the respect that it gives to the Rangers, POWs, and Philippine people who lived, fought, and survived this conflict in World War II history.",5,History That Has Finally Been Told,1124150400,"08 16, 2005",2005,2146,"['GREAT', 'RAID', 'documentary', 'newsreel', 'US', 'military', 'involvement', 'Philippines', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'proceeding', 'scene', 'film', 'most', 'highly', 'emotional', 'scene', 'act', 'aggression', 'Japanese', 'army', 'POWs', 'scene', 'suggestive', 'horrific', 'US', 'soldiers', 'as', 'well', 'Philippine', 'American', 'civilian', 'POWs', 'had', 'endure', 'Pacific', 'conflict', 'film', 'historical', 'narrative', 'US', 'military', 'POWs', 'Japanese', 'POW', 'camp', 'Cabanatuan', 'successful', 'rescue', 'US', '6th', 'Ranger', 'Battalion', 'was', 'most', 'heroic', 'historical', 'event', 'occurred', 'January', '1945', 'not', 'only', 'involved', '121', 'US', 'Army', 'Rangers', 'essential', 'effort', 'terms', 'manpower', 'medical', 'assistance', 'Philippine', 'guerillas', 'Philippine', 'underground', 'helped', 'aid', 'effort', 'saving', '512', 'POWs', 'hands', 'Japanese', 'army', 'film', 'Philippine', 'involvement', 'war', 'perspective.Hollywood', 'tends', 'romanticize', 'history', 'However', 'GREAT', 'RAID', 'true', 'historical', 'record', 'not', 'editorialize', 'event', 'film', 'may', 'bear', 'similarities', 'war', 'films', 'past', 'content', 'context', 'storyline', 'duty', 'soldier', 'completion', 'mission', 'regardless', 'consequences', 'However', 'not', 'film', 'guts', 'glory', 'only', 'element', 'film', 'somewhat', 'disconnected', 'suggestive', 'romance', 'Major', 'Gibson', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Margaret', 'Utinsky', 'Connie', 'Neilsen', 'soft', 'sentimental', 'intermission', 'war', 'horror', 'war', 'war', 'not', 'pretty.Overall', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'RAID', 'highly', 'recommended', 'film', 'not', 'other', 'war', 'film', 'been', 'released', 'pertaining', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'One', 'may', 'compare', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'film', 'due', 'particular', 'event', 'place', 'people', 'respect', 'Rangers', 'POWs', 'Philippine', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'fought', 'survived', 'conflict', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'history']",N/A

946649,AK61LQI92GTCH,B000BOH8UA,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[4, 8]","With respect verging on adoration John Dahl's THE GREAT RAID tells the story of the liberation of about 500 American POWs held by the Japanese in the Cabanatuan prison camp.  Actually, it tells three stories - that of the POWs, who'd survived the infamous Bataan Death March and three plus years of brutality in the subhuman camp; the Filipino underground and their valiant efforts to smuggle goods, especially malaria fighting quinine, into the camp; and the superbly trained yet untested 6th Ranger Battalion, who conducted the great raid behind enemy lines to rescue the prisoners.Clocking in at two hours and small change, THE GREAT RAID juggles the three stories somewhat awkwardly.  Yes, all the characters are treated with a great deal of respect, but not much depth.  Joseph Fiennes, as an officer in the POW camp, comes off best, but we never spend enough time with him to get close to him.  We care about him because he's rail thin, obviously ill, and in immediate physical danger at the hands of the sadistic Japanese guards - not because the movies lets us get to know and care about him.  Not enough time, I guess.  The scenes with the Rangers, led by real-life Lt. Col. Mucci (Benjamin Bratt) are the most riveting.  If the characters are two-dimensional, the action scenes are very well done - not any noticeable cgi, fight scenes that you don't get lost in.  The corner of the triangle that doesn't fit is the one containing the Filipino underground scenes.  Connie Nielsen plays the courageous Scandinavian nurse who repeatedly risks her life to smuggle vitally needed drugs to the prisoners.  I don't fault the movie for paying homage to yet another real-life character (Margaret Utinsky), or creating a fictionalized love interest for her in the Fiennes' character.  And I don't want to take it out on this movie, but the reverential, everyone's-a-hero attitude adopted by practically all WWII movies nowadays is starting to get old.  The only grit in these films is supplied by the Enemy, likewise two-dimensional, their lack of redeeming virtue mirrored by the good guys' lack of incriminating vice. There are a couple of rather substantial Japanese roles here - a secret police officer in Manila, a prison camp commandant.  But they're based upon ancient models - circa 1942 or thereabouts - when the Japanese were typically depicted as devious, inhuman torturers.  Those old stereotypes are recycled here.  All that's missing are the buck teeth and thick glasses.For all that THE GREAT RAID did offer a detailed look at a somewhat neglected episode, and I enjoyed it enough to give it a tepid recommendation.",3,The Great Raid,1159142400,"09 25, 2006",2006,2631,"['respect', 'verging', 'adoration', 'John', 'Dahl', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'RAID', 'story', 'liberation', 'about', '500', 'American', 'POWs', 'held', 'Japanese', 'Cabanatuan', 'prison', 'camp', 'Actually', 'three', 'stories', 'POWs', 'who', ""'d"", 'survived', 'infamous', 'Bataan', 'Death', 'March', 'three', 'years', 'brutality', 'subhuman', 'camp', 'Filipino', 'underground', 'valiant', 'efforts', 'smuggle', 'goods', 'especially', 'malaria', 'fighting', 'quinine', 'camp', 'superbly', 'trained', 'yet', 'untested', '6th', 'Ranger', 'Battalion', 'who', 'conducted', 'great', 'raid', 'enemy', 'lines', 'rescue', 'prisoners.Clocking', 'two', 'hours', 'small', 'change', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'RAID', 'three', 'stories', 'somewhat', 'awkwardly', 'Yes', 'characters', 'are', 'treated', 'great', 'deal', 'respect', 'not', 'much', 'depth', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'officer', 'POW', 'camp', 'off', 'best', 'never', 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'get', 'close', 'care', 'rail', 'thin', 'obviously', 'ill', 'immediate', 'physical', 'danger', 'hands', 'sadistic', 'Japanese', 'guards', 'not', 'movies', 'get', 'know', 'care', 'Not', 'enough', 'time', 'guess', 'scenes', 'Rangers', 'led', 'real-life', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Mucci', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'are', 'most', 'riveting', 'characters', 'are', 'two-dimensional', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'noticeable', 'cgi', 'fight', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'lost', 'corner', 'triangle', ""n't"", 'fit', 'one', 'containing', 'Filipino', 'underground', 'scenes', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'courageous', 'Scandinavian', 'nurse', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'life', 'smuggle', 'vitally', 'needed', 'drugs', 'prisoners', 'do', ""n't"", 'fault', 'movie', 'paying', 'homage', 'yet', 'real-life', 'character', 'Margaret', 'Utinsky', 'creating', 'fictionalized', 'love', 'interest', 'Fiennes', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'out', 'movie', 'reverential', ""everyone's-a-hero"", 'attitude', 'adopted', 'practically', 'WWII', 'movies', 'starting', 'get', 'old', 'only', 'grit', 'films', 'supplied', 'Enemy', 'likewise', 'two-dimensional', 'lack', 'redeeming', 'virtue', 'mirrored', 'good', 'guys', 'lack', 'incriminating', 'vice', 'are', 'couple', 'rather', 'substantial', 'Japanese', 'roles', 'here', 'secret', 'police', 'officer', 'Manila', 'prison', 'camp', 'commandant', ""'re"", 'based', 'ancient', 'models', 'circa', '1942', 'thereabouts', 'when', 'Japanese', 'were', 'typically', 'depicted', 'devious', 'inhuman', 'torturers', 'old', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'recycled', 'here', 'missing', 'are', 'buck', 'teeth', 'thick', 'glasses.For', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'RAID', 'did', 'offer', 'detailed', 'look', 'somewhat', 'neglected', 'episode', 'enjoyed', 'enough', 'give', 'tepid', 'recommendation']",N/A

But did you know there was a lot going on besides all that in the Pacific? The Phillippines were under Japanese control, and thousands of Phillipino citizens and American soldiers were suffering tremendous hardships in prison camps.This movie proves that great inspirational, and more often heartbreaking, stories were made about men who cared enough about their fellow soldiers enough to put their own lives on the line to rescue them.......The main story is that 500 P.O.W.'s [Prisoners of War] are being held in the Cabanatuan prison camp held by Japanese forces in the last year of the second world war. Joseph Fiennes plays a POW named Major Gibson. He was a survivor of the Bataan Death March and now is under poor medical treatment while he is suffering from an illness. While he and his men suffer for more than three years, little do they know a group of American soldiers are hurriedly planning a raid on the prison camp and set them free.Benjamin Bratt playes Lt. Colonel Henry Mucci, a battle hardened soldier who is ready to see the suffering of the captured men end. Along side him who would lead the raid is Captain Prince [played by James Franco] both men lead only 120 men against a force of over 10,000 Japanese soldiers who are spread all throughout the camp and areas near them as reinforcements.There are other stories in this movie as well. From the Phillipino underground resistance movement in cities nearby, to a nurse [played by Connie Nielson] helping the underground resistance by smuggling medicine into the prison camp. The 120 men also suffer setbacks such as an open area right in front of the prison camp that offers little to no protection, and also lack of transportation for the sick prisoners.Be warned, there is also a lot of violence. The first few scenes involving brutal execution of American soldiers led into underground bunkers is enough to make anyone feel at least slightly uncomfortable. But besides that this is one exciting movie that guarantees you will get to know the characters and believe with them in what they are fighting for.The extras include:Deleted ScenesThe Price of Freedom: The making of the movie.War in the Pacific Timeline of all the major historical eventsCommentary with the director on the movieand having the real World War 2 veterans of the movie remember what happened in the raid.This is definately a movie worthy of your time, and the ending is fantastic, Highly recommended.",5,The Greatest Successful Raid in US.

In fact, I was thrilled that such a movie could even be made in today's liberal, multi-culti Hollywood.  It is refreshing, having the Imperial Japanese soldiers portrayed as the murderous beasts they often were, and not having modern liberal pieties projected back on to the WWII Americans.But, the overall production is disappointingly wooden.  Even that would be okay, if the unnecessary romantic subplot hadn't intruded itself throughout.  The costumes and sets in the Manila scenes are letter-perfect, and those scenes generate some real suspense.  So I'm not saying that there shouldn't have been any female element at all.

Case in point The Great Raid, one of Miramax's infamous shelf-hoggers. Initially intended as a Steven Spielberg-Tom Cruise vehicle before they got a better offer from the Martians, it finally went before the cameras in Australia and China in 2002 with the less than A-list combo of director John Dahl and an underpowered cast headed by Benjamin Bratt, James Franco, Joseph Fiennes and Connie Nielson only for Harvey Scissorhands to spend three years tinkering with the cut (Disney later claimed that, like the 45 other films still on the shelf at the time they parted company, the Weinsteins shelved it so it wouldn't affect their performance-related bonus and severance pay), by which time it had cost some $70m or more. Junked in a few theatres to no discernible business in their let's-wreck-the-joint-for-the-new-management spree when they started their new company, it never made it across the Atlantic, quietly sneaking out onto DVD when no-one was looking.While it's easy to see why Spielberg and Cruise bailed - not enough drama, no big star role - the end result certainly isn't anything to be ashamed of. Based on the most successful rescue mission in US military history, when a group of untested Rangers rescued 500 prisoners of war in Cabanatuan in the Philippines before their Japanese captors could kill them, it's the kind of film you're surprised wasn't made decades ago. Even the casting of Fiennes seems strangely reminiscent of James Fox (an actor his career seems to be aping more and more lately) in the undervalued King Rat and even if the film is never quite as stark, it surprisingly avoids historical revisionism or excuses for the Japanese. The opening sequence, though not excessively gory, is genuinely shocking in its callousness, and unlike Pearl Harbor the film makes no attempt to water down the brutality of the Japanese Army to those they deemed inferior races, Allied prisoners and Filipino civilians alike: it's hard to see this selling many tickets in Japan.Curiously its biggest problem is its historical accuracy: the determination to (for the most part) avoid phoney heroics unfortunately isn't matched by an ability to make the long march to the camp particularly dramatic, the Rangers themselves barely registering as characters for much of the movie. At times this puts more weight on the prison camp sequences and a subplot with Connie Nielson's doctor smuggling drugs to the prisoners through the local underground (true but playing more like demographic-inspired fiction at times) than they can bear, with much of the middle of the film sagging, especially compared to the surprisingly powerful ending. As with most P.O.W. films, the actors look too healthy despite their best efforts and the desaturated photography has become too much of a war movie clich&eacute; to impress anymore, but there's a sincerity to the film and a pride in what these men did that carries it over many of its rough patches: it's hard not to feel moved by the lengthy archive footage of the real liberated prisoners and their rescuers at the end (the 2-disc director's cut DVD also includes also a couple of powerful documentaries with veterans). One niggle though: while most of the cast make credible enough soldiers, filmmakers really should stop casting Dale Dye as officers - he may be the only real soldier in the picture, but he never convinces as one on screen and his cameos are starting to get as annoyingly gratuitous as Michael G. Wilson's in the Bond films.",3,Prisoners of Miramax,1196899200,"12 6, 2007",2007,3706,"['films', 'just', 'get', 'made', 'simply', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'money', 'been', 'wasted', 'developing', 'almost', 'unthinkable', 'not', 'make', 'even', 'everyone', 'studio', 'long', 'lost', 'interest', 'Case', 'point', 'Great', 'Raid', 'one', 'Miramax', 'infamous', 'shelf-hoggers', 'Initially', 'intended', 'Steven', 'Spielberg-Tom', 'Cruise', 'vehicle', 'got', 'better', 'offer', 'Martians', 'finally', 'went', 'cameras', 'Australia', 'China', '2002', 'less', 'A-list', 'combo', 'director', 'John', 'Dahl', 'underpowered', 'cast', 'headed', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'James', 'Franco', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Connie', 'Nielson', 'only', 'Harvey', 'Scissorhands', 'spend', 'three', 'years', 'tinkering', 'cut', 'Disney', 'later', 'claimed', '45', 'other', 'films', 'still', 'shelf', 'time', 'parted', 'company', 'Weinsteins', 'shelved', 'would', ""n't"", 'affect', 'performance-related', 'bonus', 'severance', 'pay', 'time', 'had', 'cost', '70m', 'more', 'Junked', 'few', 'theatres', 'discernible', 'business', ""let's-wreck-the-joint-for-the-new-management"", 'spree', 'when', 'started', 'new', 'company', 'never', 'made', 'Atlantic', 'quietly', 'sneaking', 'out', 'DVD', 'when', 'no-one', 'was', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Spielberg', 'Cruise', 'bailed', 'not', 'enough', 'drama', 'big', 'star', 'role', 'end', 'result', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'anything', 'be', 'ashamed', 'Based', 'most', 'successful', 'rescue', 'mission', 'US', 'military', 'history', 'when', 'group', 'untested', 'Rangers', 'rescued', '500', 'prisoners', 'war', 'Cabanatuan', 'Philippines', 'Japanese', 'captors', 'could', 'kill', 'kind', 'film', ""'re"", 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'decades', 'Even', 'casting', 'Fiennes', 'strangely', 'reminiscent', 'James', 'Fox', 'actor', 'career', 'be', 'aping', 'more', 'more', 'lately', 'undervalued', 'King', 'Rat', 'even', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'stark', 'surprisingly', 'historical', 'revisionism', 'excuses', 'Japanese', 'opening', 'sequence', 'not', 'excessively', 'gory', 'genuinely', 'shocking', 'callousness', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'film', 'attempt', 'water', 'down', 'brutality', 'Japanese', 'Army', 'deemed', 'inferior', 'races', 'Allied', 'prisoners', 'Filipino', 'civilians', 'alike', 'hard', 'see', 'selling', 'many', 'tickets', 'Japan.Curiously', 'biggest', 'problem', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'determination', 'most', 'part', 'phoney', 'heroics', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'matched', 'ability', 'make', 'long', 'march', 'camp', 'particularly', 'dramatic', 'Rangers', 'barely', 'registering', 'characters', 'much', 'movie', 'times', 'more', 'weight', 'prison', 'camp', 'sequences', 'subplot', 'Connie', 'Nielson', 'doctor', 'smuggling', 'drugs', 'prisoners', 'local', 'underground', 'true', 'playing', 'more', 'demographic-inspired', 'fiction', 'times', 'can', 'bear', 'much', 'middle', 'film', 'sagging', 'especially', 'compared', 'surprisingly', 'powerful', 'ending', 'most', 'P.O.W', 'films', 'actors', 'look', 'too', 'healthy', 'best', 'efforts', 'desaturated', 'photography', 'become', 'too', 'much', 'war', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'impress', 'anymore', 'sincerity', 'film', 'pride', 'what', 'men', 'did', 'many', 'rough', 'patches', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'moved', 'lengthy', 'archive', 'footage', 'real', 'liberated', 'prisoners', 'rescuers', 'end', '2-disc', 'director', 'cut', 'DVD', 'also', 'also', 'couple', 'powerful', 'documentaries', 'veterans', 'One', 'niggle', 'most', 'cast', 'make', 'credible', 'enough', 'soldiers', 'filmmakers', 'really', 'should', 'stop', 'casting', 'Dale', 'Dye', 'officers', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'real', 'soldier', 'picture', 'never', 'one', 'screen', 'cameos', 'are', 'starting', 'get', 'annoyingly', 'gratuitous', 'Michael', 'G.', 'Wilson', 'Bond', 'films']",N/A
946658,A1E2POEKKLNLD9,B000BOH8UA,"Triniman ""Triniman""","[13, 18]","Inspired by the true story about the greatest rescue mission ever undertaken by the US military, The Great Raid tells how 125 mostly novice troops from the 6th Ranger Battalion embarked upon a very dangerous journey to free about 500 US POWs, held in a Japanese prison camp, in the Philippines, in 1945. The Japanese policy regarding POWs at the time was to let no one escape, kill them all off and leave no trace, to eliminate war crime witnesses. At the time of the war, the Americans were more focused on stopping Hitler in Europe, but once that was under control, they turned their attention to the Pacific theatre and the Japanese. As the Americans began to make a foothold in the Philippines, the Japanese would attempt to massacre all their POWs.In one of the opening scenes, we see groups of American soldiers herded into abandoned snipers nests. Drums of gasoline wee placed at the entrances to barricade them in but to also burn them alive. Anyone who managed to escape, while on fire, was machine gunned to death.New intelligence told the military that there were 500 souls languishing in dire straits, for about three years now, in a POW camp, and they would be in jeopardy of being wiped out. Could a relatively small contingent of troops plan a rescue mission, travel undetected and pull it all off? Being spotted by even one Japanese scout would jeopardize the entire mission as thousands of Japanese troops were nearby. The tentative Captain Prince, played by James Franco, was charged with drafting the rescue plan and leading the men in the field, under the supervision of LCol. Mucci. Mucci spoke to men about how they were the finest trained Rangers yet to see action, etc., and that their actions will either mark them well historically or they will be forgotten over time if they failed. He hoped that his pep talk could get a lot of heart out of the troops who had no combat experience.There is a parallel story here about the Philippine underground resistance, working to smuggle medication into the camp. Nurse Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen) worked in one the cells. She was the former wife of an American officer, deceased, who fell in love with an American Maj, Maj Gibson (Joseph Fiennes.) Gibson ended up as prisoner at the camp and acted as the ranking officer for the POWs, and suffered terribly from life-threatening malaria. On one of the camp's shopping trips to the local market, in which they enlist the soldiers to replenish supplies (who knew?), Maj Gibson made contact with one of the Philippine underground to smuggle in some medicine, from Margaret. This is the film's only romance. Will it be spoiled by the Japanese military intelligence?Meanwhile, the rag tag rescue party snuck their way towards the camp, evading the Japanese as best they could, although not without incident.Is this like Saving Private Ryan, but on a larger scale? Yes and no. The aim, to rescue otherwise doomed POWs, is not unlike trying to save Pt. Ryan. Saving Private Ryan was a superior film, ironically, with a much stronger emotional impact, even though that film was about rescuing one person. Also, The Great Raid is not as good as the 1957 classic film Bridge on the River Kwai, which has similar subject matter.By and large, the acting was very solid. I found it unfortunate that there wasn't enough character development of the rescue mission soldiers. Getting to know them a bit better would have increased my interest in their struggle. Joseph Fieness, honestly, was exceptionally miscast. He was dour and lifeless and just plain boring, showing not enough depth of humanity or emotion. Ironically, maybe he was too much like a real POW in that regard. Dale Dye is a name you may not be familiar with, but he shows up once again, playing a US military officer, this time in the form of General Kreuger. You'll recognize him when you see him.At the end of the film, as the credits rolled against footage of POWs being liberated, ushered home on ships, reunited with loved ones and finally paraded in front of adoring crowds, the remaining audience sat in silence, absolutely transfixed by what they were watching. Some, I think, were likely thinking back to the war and their loved ones who participated. And the sacrifices never forgotten. No doubt, this film will stir deep feelings for some, particularly those who have loved ones fighting oversees. It's interesting to note that another film about LCol Mucci is apparently in the works - Ghost Soldiers, another Spielberg/ Tom Cruise effort, based on the book of the same name by author Hampton Sides.The Great Raid has too many slow moving parts and not enough character development. No one person stood out as the protagonist. It's not the landmark film that it set out to be. The film was supposed to be released first in 2003, then in 2004, but it was delayed by the dissolution of the Disney-Miramax partnership. With the lack of advertising, I believe Miramax doesn't believe in this film. Opened August 12, 2005.",3,Slow moving.
