764735,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000AM6NV,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","Some films bring absolutely nothing to the table.  `Boat Trip' is one of them, unless you count to HOTNESS that is Roselyn Sanchez.  Really thought, outside of Roselyn's glorious legs and her sensually stimulating accent, this movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen; period.It is crude, yet not crude enough to make up for the fact that it is an offensive mess.  You see, what a film takes on such a controversial and easily destructible premise as the one delivered here, that said film really needs to GO FOR IT in order to make it worth your time.  I mean, if you are going to merely skirt around the subject matter then you might as well pack up and go home.I really wish that had been the case, because then this film would have never been made.Two straight men, one eternally depressed over some chick, wind up taking a cruise with a ton of lubed up gay men.  A recipe for disaster if I ever saw one, but if the writers (and cast and director) had actually went balls to the wall with this concept they could have at least created something funny.  Instead, their tepid approach creates a far more offensive product.It's insulting to my intelligence.Yes, Sanchez is hot.  That is all that I walked away with.

764736,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B0000AM6NV,Brad Baker,"[0, 0]","Here's a movie that seems to have offended almost everybody. It's certainly different. Artisan Pictures snuck ""Boat Trip"" into theatres in early 2003, months after it's completion the year before. In 2002's ""Boat Trip"", Jerry and Nick are two cool Gen-X guys just looking for love; they get side-tracked onto a rollicking 5-day, non-stop European cruise. OOPS!! Too bad this cruise is just for gay guys! TV screenwriter-turned-director Mort Nathan has assembled a lively, fast-paced comedy that dares to pull it's pants down. Pardon me. His pants down. Gender-bending, gay-bashing, and outright homophobia clash with Swedish bathing beauties in this zippy, sparkling frolic.  ""Boat Trip"" stars the remarkable Cuba Gooding Jr., and features Vivica Fox, Will Ferrell, and the delicious Puerto Rican Roselyn Sanchez. 74-year-old Roger Moore is nearly hysterical as a devilish gay queen. Flooded with bright, tropical colors, ""Boat Trip"" was shot in Cologne, Germany, and the alluring Greek Islands. This brand new 1.77:1 anamorphic widescreen DVD includes out-takes(not too good), deleted scenes, chapter stops, tanning tips(don't ask), a trivia track, trailers, and a documentary first aired on Showtime Cable last spring.

The theater was filled to capapcity with a mixed straight/gay crowd and hardly 5 min. went by without the audience bursting into laughter and occaisionaly applause, punctuated with a few outbursts of laughter from gay members of the audience at some of the inside jabs.This movie has been accused of being filled with unflattering stereotypes that are insulting, of course the people saying that are humorless straight critics with nothing better to do than to try to look for things insulting to the ""Others"" who need to be protected from things like humor.In truth this is a hilarious laugh out loud comedy with the rather simple plot of, ""Boy (Cuba Gooding Jr.) gets dumped by beautiful yet icy girlfriend, played by Vivika A Fox.  Boys semi-obnoxious beer guzzling friend tells him they're going on a cruise to meet women, after insulting the travel agent they wind up on a gay cruise, hilarity ensues.  Throw in a gorgeous woman dance instructor on the ship that catches Cuba's eye, a rescue of the Sweedish bikini-Suntanning team and more hardbodies than you see in an average Gay Pride march and there is something for everybody in this film.

Also, the movie cover only desplicts the two lead actors on a boat with women wearing bikinis.  They don't say anything about this movie being about the men going on a gay man cruise mistakenly.  This proves that the producers are sell-outs.  If they would have written it on there, this would have been a wonderful gay pride movie.

And none of them were clever or fresh.Cuba Gooding Jr. and Horatio Sanz wanted to ride on a singles boat ride but they had mistakenly went on a gay cruise, filled with gay people. The passengers are doing gay things, drinking on a gay bar and dancing on a gay club. The leads had to pretend to be gay to not stick out by their ungayness, but one of the leads discovered an attractive woman, so he HAS to pretend to be gay to get his gay on with her.James Bondgoes all gay for the fat lead, gay people are playing poker in drag. It's a gay parade all the time, everyone's having a gay old time!  Am I bothering you yet?  Hope so, because this movie was bothering me.Just to be clear for certain people who have the wrong idea, understand this: characters who exert themselves through promiscuous and brassy means are annoying regardless of their sexual orientation.  This movie is aggravatingly loud, it's banal at how abstract and clamorous the homosexuals acted, and how homophobic and despicable the main characters are.  Nay, when it comes to Horatio Sanz, I felt sorry for him more than hating him . He's desperately trying to make me laugh, but he looked pathetic when he did all his perverted and 'I'm-not-gay' antics.  This guy had no confidence in his role, he's about as morbid as that fat guy from ""Balls of Fury""...and yet, he's complacent compared to Cuba Gooding Jr.At least Horatio's character grew to get along with the odd buddies, while Cuba's obnoxious character hardly had any interactions with the non-straight crowd. He spend most of the cruise hiding his heterosexuality so he can try to get a piece on Roselyn Sanchez's character, a swimming instructor who's a flat-out tease existing to pout and glee; she just uncanny, the way she said she doesn't put on make-up yet she's clearly has them on, and how she's inexplicably being flirtatious towards Cuba.  Despite being the effeminate character and taking part of a dance show at one scene, Cuba came off as being as much of a sexist jerk as he tried to convince Roselyn that he's not.  The movie sure liked to tell me who I'm suppose to like, like how Horatio said 'that gay dude's a doctor, and the other guy's a criminal lawyer.  They're pretty cool guys'; that doesn't mean anything, having a profession doesn't excuse their behavior.I find the movie's plot to be just as lazy as its humor.  One example of lazy story development occurred when Vivica A. Fox's character in the beginning breaking up with Cuba, and then for no reason wanted to be back with him; she basically existed as a plot fork to stab the relationship between Cuba and Roselyn. The way she confronted him and how he decided to want her again was literally rushed: she pushed him for forgiveness, and the next shot the film took place on a wedding chapel; no departure of the boat, no farewell to the 'memorable' crew, just straight to the climax.  It didn't give me a chance to settle.""Boat Trip"" is offensive, asinine, and most astoundingly misleading.  The DVD cover of this movie implied it was gonna be a raunchy version of ""The Love Boat""; heck, even the DVD menu has a couple of topless women.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[14, 19]","Well, a movie that shamelessly plays into every conceivable gay stereotype and cliche has got to be annoying, even offensive, doesn't it?  That was my first impression when I started watching BOAT TRIP, but as the film moved along, and meandered through a bad script and over-the-top slapstick physical comedy, I found myself chuckling, then, of all things, actually laughing.  It became apparent that BOAT TRIP never, ever, had any intention of taking itself seriously, so why the heck should the viewer?The plot is lame, but still entertaining:  Jerry (Cuba Gooding Jr.), distraught over being dumped by his girlfriend, and his pal, Nick (Horatio Sanz), decide to ""score"" by booking a cruise.  Problem is, it's a gay cruise--much to the shock and horror of the two buds.  And of course, every conceivable gay stereotype is then trotted out for the viewer; some of it bombs, some of it (the gay poker players) is downright funny.  And then Jerry finds himself falling in love with the only woman (at the time) on the ship, dance instructor Gabriella (played by a wonderfully hot Roselyn Sanchez).  Problem is, Gabriella is fed up with hetero men, and longs to seduce a gay man, so Jerry must pretend to be gay (leading to even more absurdity, yet Gooding manages to pull the zaniness off).Gooding and Sanchez do well with what they have to work with, while Sanz is an annoying John Belushi wannabe.  Other cast members include a very creepy Roger Moore, and sensational Playboy playmate Victoria Silverstedt.  Will Ferrell even makes a brief, over-the-top appearance.  No, BOAT TRIP is probably a movie I won't take the time to watch again, but it has its fluid, laughable moments.  Hey, how can a film featuring the Swedish Suntanning Team be a dud?--D.

This film does have many of those elements, but, to a thinking audience it provides much more showing the variety in the Gay community shocking the straight characters with the reality of it.

764761,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0000AM6NV,Joe Sherry,"[7, 14]","The previews made this movie look like it could be decent. Boat Trip stars Cuba Gooding, Jr, an Academy Award winning actor (Best Supporting Actor, Jerry Maguire ). With Cuba in a leading role, I had hopes that he would have chosen a good movie to be in. I was wrong.A local review of this movie gave it only one star. At the box office, Boat Trip only made three million dollars in the opening weekend. There is a reason for that. The movie is not that good.The premise is that Cuba is dumped by his girlfriend as he proposes marriage (she says no and tells him there is another man). After six months he is still so despondent that he sits and stares at the screensaver on his computer (ex girlfriend). His friend (played by Horatio Sanz from SNL) decides that they can meet women by going on a cruise. On the way to the travel agent Horatio is cut off in the parking lot. Horatio curses out the guy, but he turns out to be the travel agent. As punishment, Horatio and Cuba are booked on a cruise....a gay cruise. As a premise, this has some potential to be funny. It is in the execution that the movie fails to deliver.I will be upfront and say that the movie did have funny moments. Quite a few of them at times. Unfortunately, the humor was more in how shocking it was rather than in the joke. I did laugh and I did find some things funny. At the same time, I was realizing that the movie wasn't that good. There was a moment, where Horatio (the more homophobic of the pair) realizes that gay men are people too and that he may be gay. It felt heavy handed and out of place with the rest of the movie. The scene was probably only there to show how not anti-gay the movie is. The movie also undermined that scene later on in the actions of Horatio towards a woman from the Swedish Bikini team (not worth mentioning how they got on the cruise).Ultimately the movie was forgettable. Am I mad that I saw it? No. Do I want to see it again?

764767,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B0000AM6NV,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[1, 3]","'Boat Trip' is the ultimate gay film for straight people. It's a wonderfully witty and irresistable comedy about two straight men (Cuba Gooding Jr. and  Horatio Sanz) who take a Caribbean cruise, hoping to get lucky, only to discover that they were accidentally booked on an all-gay cruise instead. When Jerry (Gooding Jr.) falls for the dance instructor on the cruise, he must put on a charade and pretend to be gay. Nick (Sanz), on the other hand, falls in love with a Swedish model when her suntanning team is rescued and brought aboard the ship.Being gay, the first question on my mind about 'Boat Trip' was: Will the movie be offensive? The basic plot alone is like nitro glycerin for the easily offended, but, while `Boat Trip' doesn't travel lightly on its subject, it does move carefully. The film is a silly exercise in hetero panic, and is not, for one frame of film, mean-spirited in any shape or form. The film wants to be funny, not hateful, and understands that trafficking in stereotypes can be dangerous business, so it picks its targets cautiously. Some obvious stereotypes aside, soon enough it is clearly established that the most sensible characters in the entire film are the homosexual ones, thus negating any call to arms against the film.Cuba Gooding Jr. is charming, and Horatio Sanz is hilarious. Roselyn Sanchez is wonderful as the dance instructor, and Vivica A. Fox is a nice addition as Jerry's ex-girlfriend, who has come on the cruise to win him back. Lin Shaye is HILARIOUS as the overprotective couch of the suntanning team, and former playmate Victoria Silvstedt is perfect as Nick's Swedish love interest. Roger Moore and Richard Roundtree are a surprise addition to the superb cast.This is definitely not a critic's film. While the critics seem to hate this movie, the audience was laughing out loud and most of them seemed to be pleased by film's end. If anything, 'Boat Trip' is good for a few laughs on a boring Saturday night. It's a crowd-pleasing film, and a pure pleasure to watch. I absolutely adored it.

However, if some light and crude humour buzzes you, then ""Boat Trip"" may be just the thing you are looking for.Two guys both have differing love issues, (one gets dumped for a car detailer and the other just hasn't gotten past 1st base except with a 51-year-old with a fake leg). As a solution, they book a cruise, but the vindictive travel agent books them both on a gay cruise in revenge for their argument with his boyfriend.The marriage between romance ""feel good"" and crude sexual innuendo just doesn't work as well in ""Boat Trip"" as it has with other movies. The plot certainly has a lot of potential, but that seemed rather unrealised in many ways.Being of simple humour, I enjoyed a lot of the antics of Cuba Gooding Jr and Horatio Sanz as they both solved their problems in their own unique ways. The movie particularly showed Gooding's versatilty in his ability to play a fairly light role, as well as the more serious ones in other movies.""Boat Trip"" is certainly not up there with other trip oriented movies, but is good for a chuckle.

It never fails to make me laugh and really, I don't think its any worse than some of the other movies out there that get rated highly (Harold and Kumar, Van Wilder, Etc.).  Sure its got a prolific amount of breasts and some of the humour is off-color, but its still funny.Jerry (Cuba Gooding Jr.) has been in a deep funk since his girlfriend (Vivica Fox) has broken up with him.  Nick (Horatio Sanz) decides that the perfect way to cheer him up would be to take him on a single's cruise so they can meet women and have lots of sex.  No fail right?  Well it would have been if Nick hadn't got in a fight with the travel agent and instead they were booked for a gay cruise instead.  Not knowing until the boat has launched, they find themselves surrounded by men and no women in sight.  But then, some special circumstances happen.  Jerry finds that the dance instructor (Roselyn Sanchez) on board is happy to be on a gay cruise, because she doesn't feel self conscious around gay men.  He enlists Nick's help in pretending to be gay to win her over.  Nick on the other hand, has shot down a helicopter full of tanning team model-like women, who are guarded by their short crazy coach who develops a thing for him.  As time goes on, things get more complicated but they also learn a lot too, especially in Nick's case, about how to be tolerant.Alright, so Cuba Gooding Jr did a good job in this movie.  I especially loved his dance scene.  It gets me laughing every time.  I'm not as big a fan of the women in this movie because they seem very high maintenance to me.  Nick is also a little high maintenance although it was nice to see his character become a little more accepting.This movie could have the potential to offend some people.  It is about the gay community and does use some stereotypes.  But it is also a movie about growth and seeing that just because some people are different, it doesn't make them bad.  The cruise actually looked like a lot of fun and I think I'm drawn to the movie because I've never taken a cruise.  It seems there is quite a lot to do.  The humour in this movie ranges from subtle to all out there and everywhere in between and it probably isn't for everyone (hence the low ratings on this film).  But regardless, I did laugh out loud at several parts.  The love story is a little implausible, but still fun to watch.Maybe I'm one of a few but I think this is a great movie.  I can laugh and enjoy it anytime and would recommend it to anyone even though they might think I'm crazy afterwards.Review by M.

After a squabble with a travel agent, the two friends are set up to take a gay cruise unbeknownst to them. On a gay cruise he finds of all things the woman of his dreams. The story line is lame I must admit, but there are some laughs. There is absolutely no gay bashing. The R rating is due to the nature of conversation and suggestive actions. The only nudity is watching some men walk around in those butt less pants. Plus, they have a new one.

While the blame mostly lands on the feeble shoulders of the script, the acting and direction also contributed greatly to its floundering.Boat Trip stars Cuba Gooding Jr., Horatio Sanz, and a very hot Roselyn Sanchez as the love interest (sort of). In the opening sequence, Jerry (Cuba) is dumped by his girlfriend (played flatly by Vivica A. Fox), and in an effort to cheer him up, Nick (Sanz) convinces Jerry to head out on a singles cruise with him. The problem, of course, is that through a series of foul-ups, they end up on a Gay cruise. The problem worsens when Jerry meets Gabriella (Sanchez) and falls instantly in love with her. He decides to pretend to be gay, since she's made it clear that she's done with straight men and that she is trying to get a gay man to sleep with her. From here various subplots play out, including Nick questioning his own sexuality, a creepy appearance by Roger Moore as a gay Donald Trump character, and a reappearance by Vivica A. Fox. All ends as it should, happily ever after.The movie was by no stretch awful, but it was horribly acted and completely clich?-ridden. I find it amazing how quickly Gooding has gone from Oscar-caliber work to starring as a sidekick to a SNL character actor. None of the genius that seemed to shine in his earlier films (Jerry McGuire, As Good as it Gets) is even faintly present here. The best aspect of the movie by far is Sanchez, who was the only one not throwing herself over the top in that &quot;slam-you-over-the-head&quot; style comedy weighting this one down. Otherwise, the only reason I can suggest renting this is for the DVD menu. It's literally the most random thing I've ever seen. It has nothing to do with the movie - nothing to do with anything, really. I can't imagine why they used it. I'm not saying it's bad, not by a long shot, just random and actually worth renting it for.Sanz will certainly go on to do several of these bombs in the next few years, being the closest thing we have to Chris Farley, and Sanchez is just too talented and attractive to stay in this caliber of film. Gooding, however, is in trouble. After his last few performances (Pearl Harbor, The Fighting Temptations, Snow Dogs, etc.) I'm skeptical he'll ever recover, and may be destined to the B movie genre from here on out.",2,Doomed for an iceberg...,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,2435,"['movie', 'had', 'elements', 'something', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'good', 'various', 'reasons', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'marginally', 'acceptable', 'blame', 'mostly', 'feeble', 'shoulders', 'script', 'acting', 'direction', 'also', 'contributed', 'greatly', 'floundering.Boat', 'Trip', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Horatio', 'Sanz', 'very', 'hot', 'Roselyn', 'Sanchez', 'love', 'interest', 'sort', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Jerry', 'Cuba', 'dumped', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'flatly', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'effort', 'cheer', 'up', 'Nick', 'Sanz', 'Jerry', 'head', 'out', 'singles', 'cruise', 'problem', 'course', 'series', 'foul-ups', 'end', 'up', 'Gay', 'cruise', 'problem', 'when', 'Jerry', 'Gabriella', 'Sanchez', 'instantly', 'love', 'pretend', 'be', 'gay', 'made', 'clear', 'done', 'straight', 'men', 'trying', 'get', 'gay', 'man', 'sleep', 'here', 'various', 'subplots', 'play', 'out', 'including', 'Nick', 'questioning', 'own', 'sexuality', 'creepy', 'appearance', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'gay', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'character', 'reappearance', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'should', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.The', 'movie', 'was', 'stretch', 'awful', 'was', 'horribly', 'acted', 'completely', 'clich', '-ridden', 'find', 'amazing', 'how', 'quickly', 'Gooding', 'gone', 'Oscar-caliber', 'work', 'starring', 'sidekick', 'SNL', 'character', 'actor', 'None', 'genius', 'seemed', 'shine', 'earlier', 'films', 'Jerry', 'McGuire', 'As', 'Good', 'Gets', 'even', 'faintly', 'present', 'here', 'best', 'aspect', 'movie', 'far', 'Sanchez', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'not', 'throwing', 'top', 'quot', 'slam-you-over-the-head', 'quot', 'style', 'comedy', 'weighting', 'one', 'down', 'Otherwise', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'suggest', 'renting', 'DVD', 'menu', 'literally', 'most', 'random', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'used', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'just', 'random', 'actually', 'worth', 'renting', 'for.Sanz', 'will', 'certainly', 'go', 'do', 'several', 'bombs', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'being', 'closest', 'thing', 'have', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'Sanchez', 'just', 'too', 'talented', 'attractive', 'stay', 'caliber', 'film', 'Gooding', 'however', 'trouble', 'last', 'few', 'performances', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Fighting', 'Temptations', 'Snow', 'Dogs', 'etc', ""'m"", 'skeptical', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'recover', 'may', 'be', 'destined', 'B', 'movie', 'genre', 'here', 'out']",N/A

764788,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000AM6NV,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 11]","So, here are the facts.  'Boat Trip' was shot in 2001, but never released until 2003.  It stars Oscar-winner Cuba Godding Jr. who was nominated for the worst actor category of the Razzie Award (but, hey, he lost!) in the same year, as well as the director Mort Nathan (and he lost too!).Now, is this that bad?  I finally saw it, and now regret seeing this dreadful unfunny comedy.  Think about this.  Two straight guys (Cuba Gooding Jr. and Haratio Sanz), because of travel agent Will Farrell, end up on a 'gay only' crusie.  There are many 'funny' gags related to the situation, which are not funny at all.  One of the passanges happen to be a female Roselyn Sanchez, and Cuba Gooding Jr. fell for her.  But of course! she thinks he is a gay -- he MUST be a gay, she thinks -- and she, dancing instructor by profession, quite seriously confesses to him that she like males only when he is a gay.  Is this funny?Still reading?  So, Cuba Gooding Jr. pretends he ia a gay, and she is tricked into this strategy which I don't buy.  When Vivica A Fox as his ex-girl friend storms into the ship, things don't get better.  And if you see ex-007 agent Roger Moore (74 years old) degrading himself with some of the corniest lines he ever uttered (including as Bond), I start to wish an iceberg hit the ship, and sink the whole crew with the film itself deep into the Atlantic Ocean.That's it.  Who gave this potentially offensive project a green light?  Gay people hate it, I know, but first of all, if you're not a gay, you would still hate it for being full of cliche, uninspired gags, and the final obligatory 'message' that tries to deny the suspected homophobia in the film.
