Weaver ""karlweaver""","[0, 0]","On the strength of the actors I kept watching all the way through all 4 episodes of this Season One of a British TV series (strangely set in what appears to be Siberia, in 1917).  Side-note: BBC TV seems to have many shows of much higher quality than American TV; perhaps because they have less competition and better funding?  On the other hand, often a &#34;season&#34; has much fewer shows than the American audience is used to.  Back to this series: I wasn't able to suspend disbelief.  Even for fiction, there has to be some credibility.  Here, from the outset the young doctor fresh from graduation beginning actual practice, is constantly confronted by an older, much more jaded version of himself.  How is that supposed to be happening?  The show makes no effort at explanation.  By the end of season one there's even a suggestion he's no longer quite the green doctor and may be also confronting an even greener version of himself already...Yes there is some dark and understated humor, primarily through the expressions, the dialog and the actions of the staff surrounding this doctor in a very small and remote hospital/clinic setting.

1652923,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00D25MJ8G,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","With its macabre sense of humor, dark cynicism, and a surprising amount of medical gore, the four part BBC series ""A Young Doctor's Notebook"" may not be for everyone.  I mention this at the outset of my review because if you're anticipating this to be a genteel British period piece, the outrageously dark tone may not be to your liking.  I did not have any pre-set notions about what ""A Young Doctor's Notebook"" should be, but I was genuinely surprised by how gleefully unpleasant and in-your-face the actual episodes turned out to be.  An unrepentantly bold black comedy, I ended up really loving this series and recommending it to quite a few of my friends.  Why?  Primarily because it has a unique voice and isn't like any other thing I've seen on TV this year.  To me, that's a huge bonus in this era of cookie cutter fare.  The show stars Jon Hamm (Mad Men) and Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) as versions of the same character.  Already an amusing notion, as the two men share almost nothing in common physically, the smart scripts take much merriment in poking fun at the more diminutive Radcliffe.Radcliffe plays an idealistic young doctor, having just graduated with the highest of marks, being assigned to a rural hospital in the bitterly cold Russian country circa 1917.  Hamm plays the older doctor, who is being investigated some seventeen years later on charges that will become apparent as the episodes progress.  The story unfolds much like a theatrical experience with Radcliffe and Hamm sharing many scenes together.  As the younger man acclimatizes to his environment and starts to gain a jaded confidence, the older version of the doctor reflects back on his time in this encampment offering advice to his younger self.  As both doctors are slightly unhinged, the interplay between the two is quite funny.  And both actors are perfect.  But the situations and medical cases themselves are harrowing and graphic, but the show employs a gallows humor that one rarely sees with such intensity.  I mean that as a huge compliment!Hamm and Radcliffe are undeniably the selling point of ""A Young Doctor's Notebook,"" but I must also mention the three actors that share residence and medical duties with the doctor: Adam Godley, Vicki Pepperdine, and Rosie Cavaliero.  All are spot-on terrific and they really bring the brutal and uncompromising environment to life.  In these four episodes (each about 22-24 minutes), a lot happens to maintain your interest.  In particular, Radcliffe's transformation is both excruciatingly funny and deeply disturbing!  It may not be a big time commitment with the whole season clocking in around ninety minutes, but I got more payoff and laughs from this show than in a much longer season of traditional network fare.  I'd probably rate these episodes at 4 1/2 stars, but I'll round up because I was so genuinely surprised by how cutting and dark this show turned out to be.  I credit both Hamm and Radcliffe for taking this risk.  It was an unconventional choice for actors of their stature, but it just makes them that more ""cool"" in my book.  But as I said, if you are just watching it for them and know nothing about the show--you may be in for a shock.

1652924,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,B00D25MJ8G,lily t.,"[1, 1]","Wow. It's rare that I come across a work this original and delightful. Apparently, this series is based on Mikhail Bulgakov's [ The Master and Margarita] short lived medical career.From the sketches  contained within Bulgakov's A Young Doctor's Notebook, which this series is based on, it's hard to imagine a man less suited to the practice of medicine. Thankfully Bulgakov abandoned his first career for literature.  However, he created an absolutely hilarious world in the Notebook.I'm not sure it's easy for contemporary viewers to imagine what it was like for an urbane and modern man to be sent to serve in a remote and backward hospital  [circa 1917] in Russia, where the inhabitants of the nearest  village have an almost a medieval view of life. But when the young, academically gifted doctor arrives in the countryside, he not only faces isolation, self doubt and anxiety but also must deal with the  peasants and their incredible limitations. Along the way, we see a syphilis epidemic, an amputation and all sorts of infections, as  he slowly loses his idealism and begins to cope with life on its own terms.Though this series does not show it, Bulgakov was severely injured during the first world war, and because of the pain, became a morphine addict. Here he succumbs because of  an unknown aliment coupled with the mind numbing isolation he experiences in that remote and isolated region.The story begins with the doctor as a mature man looking back on his time in the countryside. I was absolutely floored by the casting. Neither  actor  is the sort one would ever imagine as a Russian- but  both  Hamm and Radcliffe were superb. [ Ham actually has a physical resemblance to Bulgakov] . The supporting cast, particularly the nurse and her assistant are a riot, since they look upon the new doctor as a mere child -  a weird one at that - and behave accordingly.Kudos to the Brits for making this series. It's non-commercial in the best way imaginable.  I read there was a second season in the works--hope Amazon acquires it--and soon!",5,"Phenomenal, hilarious, revolting and totally original",1392595200,"02 17, 2014",2014,2049,"['Wow', 'rare', 'come', 'work', 'original', 'delightful', 'Apparently', 'series', 'based', 'Mikhail', 'Bulgakov', '[', 'Master', 'Margarita', ']', 'short', 'lived', 'medical', 'career.From', 'sketches', 'contained', 'Bulgakov', 'A', 'Young', 'Doctor', 'Notebook', 'series', 'based', 'hard', 'imagine', 'man', 'less', 'suited', 'practice', 'medicine', 'Thankfully', 'Bulgakov', 'abandoned', 'first', 'career', 'literature', 'However', 'created', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'world', 'Notebook.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'easy', 'contemporary', 'viewers', 'imagine', 'what', 'was', 'urbane', 'modern', 'man', 'be', 'sent', 'serve', 'remote', 'backward', 'hospital', '[', 'circa', '1917', ']', 'Russia', 'where', 'inhabitants', 'nearest', 'village', 'have', 'almost', 'medieval', 'view', 'life', 'when', 'young', 'academically', 'gifted', 'doctor', 'countryside', 'not', 'only', 'isolation', 'doubt', 'anxiety', 'also', 'must', 'deal', 'peasants', 'incredible', 'limitations', 'way', 'see', 'syphilis', 'epidemic', 'amputation', 'sorts', 'infections', 'idealism', 'cope', 'life', 'own', 'terms.Though', 'series', 'not', 'show', 'Bulgakov', 'was', 'severely', 'injured', 'first', 'world', 'war', 'pain', 'became', 'morphine', 'addict', 'Here', 'unknown', 'aliment', 'coupled', 'mind', 'numbing', 'isolation', 'remote', 'isolated', 'region.The', 'story', 'doctor', 'mature', 'man', 'looking', 'back', 'time', 'countryside', 'was', 'absolutely', 'floored', 'casting', 'actor', 'sort', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'imagine', 'Russian-', 'Hamm', 'Radcliffe', 'were', 'superb', '[', 'Ham', 'actually', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'Bulgakov', ']', 'supporting', 'cast', 'particularly', 'nurse', 'assistant', 'are', 'riot', 'look', 'new', 'doctor', 'mere', 'child', 'weird', 'one', 'behave', 'accordingly.Kudos', 'Brits', 'making', 'series', 'non-commercial', 'best', 'way', 'imaginable', 'read', 'was', 'second', 'season', 'works', 'hope', 'Amazon', 'soon']","A Young Doctor's Notebook ( A Young Doctor's Note book - Season 1 ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 Import - United Kingdom ]"
1652925,A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9,B00D25MJ8G,"NyiNya ""NyiNya""","[3, 4]","This exceptional BBC series ran for just four episodes in its debut season...barely enough to satisfy, but sufficient to show us how good a television show can be.  The series is based on Mikhail Bulgakov's short story collection of the same name, and is almost alarmingly true to the book's character and content. Americans probably know Bulgakov best for his masterpiece, ""The Master and Marguerita.""  This short story collection, however, is more personal to the author, being based on his own early life, and presents readers with some of the best Russian writing of the post-revolution era, along with an excellent and always entertaining ethnography of Russian village life...and a Stalin era history lesson. The stories outline the experiences of a young doctor who practiced in Smolesnk, a Russian backwater, from 1916 to 1920.John Hamm, known to U.S. audiences from his Emmy Award winning role in ""Mad Men"" and Daniel Radcliff of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise, share star billing and a single role. Both play the same doctor, Radcliffe taking on the fresh-out-of medical school lad with no practical experience, and Hamm playing him as a cynical adult.  The series uses the gimmick of having the older Doctor interact with his younger self, advising, criticizing, provoking. It's a conceit we've seen before, but rarely done this well.  Both Radcliffe and Hamm are excellent, and the material gives them plenty to work with.The young doctor is sent to replace the late and imposing Leopold Leopoldovitch, a physician of imposing whiskers and reputation (and an extensive library of Turkish erotica, illustrated and in color.  When Leopold Leopoldovitch (always referred to by both names and in the most reverent terms) shuffles off the mortal coil, the young man must step into his shoes, not to mention oversized surgical gown.  And the poor kid only shaves every week or so.  But the lad is redeemed by two things:  The appearance of his older-self when his nerve fails, and his skill, albeit untried.  He graduated at the top of his class. ""Five in all 15,"" he brags. ""It was unprecedented!""  Not that this does any good when he has to saw both legs off of a dreadfully maimed 8 year old.The series is dark, the humor bitter, it's not always funny, people die, even young ones and nice ones. The first episode shows us the fear and optimism of the nave young practitioner; the fourth gives us the same young man already succumbing to depression and burn out.  The writers have captured that special bleakness that inhabits the Russian soul. The most mundane of things can have a saturnine twist; behind the loudest laughter there's awareness of death. It's a Russian thing. Maybe Eastern European, because the Scandinavians have it too. And the Poles. But if the humor reflects this spiritual black hole, it still manages to be funny.  And the parts that are meant to be serious? Well, it's fair to say they are sobering and unforgettable.  We deal with the doctor's own devils as he deals with his sick and injured.  And things can get bloody. Those operations don't pull any punches when it comes to showing us what it was like back in the day. Even the yanking of a rotten tooth can result in the accidental removal of a hunk of a jawbone and some truly impressive hemorrhaging.  The injuries may be gruesome, but they're just about right, given they way most peasants lived and worked.  And no staff of hotty interns to help the good doctor out. Would Doctor House have gotten as far with only the burned out hulk of his former self to advise him? Probably not, but the good doctors do have at least one thing in common, as we see in the enfolding episodes. You'll have to watch. I'm not going to spoil things if I can help it.(Just an aside: Do Americans know that Hugh Laurie, our haunted Dr. House, is one of England's best known comics and a skilled musician and singer?  ""A Bit of Fry and Laurie"" was a hilarious sketch show. His partner, Stephen Fry, also took a dark turn, going on to star in ""Kingdom."" Fry played the somewhat troubled Peter Kingdom, a not-terribly successful solicitor who juggled family secrets and the legal problems of some eccentric villagers in his small Norwich town.  The sketch show and Fry's series are both worth seeing. And so is ""Jeeves and Wooster,"" the pair's other TV series. Fry is the sensible butler, but Laurie steals the show as the nave Bertie. Whenever he was deep in his Dr. House miseries, I kept waiting for him to break into a rousing rendition of ""47 Ginger Headed Sailors."")""A Young Doctor's Notebook"" originally aired in the UK last year and pulled in tremendous ratings. Ovation picked it up here in the U.S.  For those who aren't familiar with it, Ovation is a U.S. cable network that's devoted to 'artistic' content.  Mostly good stuff.  Season 1 is now available on Amazon and Netflix.  The producers have promised us Season 2.  The problem, of course, is pulling the stars away from their lucrative day jobs.You want to see this. It's excellent television, fine acting, good production values, and not the usual predigested television fare.  And you could read the book too.  Five stars for both.",5,The Really Dark House,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,5171,"['exceptional', 'BBC', 'series', 'ran', 'just', 'four', 'episodes', 'debut', 'season', 'barely', 'satisfy',

Daniel Radcliffe is such a natural actor and can pretty much pull off any role he sets his mind to.  Looking forward to watching his career as he ages (like a fine wine)!This series is not for the faint of heart...lots o' medical violence...probably because it's more intimant and &#34;in your face&#34; than the typical ER type violence.  But if you can get past that it's very worthwhile!  Great dialogue between the 2 actors struggling within their own mind to make the right decisions.

Being a fan of Jon Hamm, and at least appreciative of Daniel Radcliffe, my wife and I bought the first episode of this series. Being based on the memoirs of a Russian doctor before, during, and after the Russian Revolution, we both thought it would be interesting. My wife found it rather dark and grim. I enjoyed it, having spent both time in the USSR (as it was then) and studying Russian history). I think if you appreciate history and a rather dark, grim kind of humor, you may enjoy this. I intend to re-visit the rest of the series when my wife is out of town. Great performances by both actors (Hamm playing the older version of Radcliffe's young doctor).",3,I liked it.

They do exceedingly well with the weirdness with which they have to work. Story is just a little too far to the left of peculiar for my taste, although I did stick with it and view all four episodes. Different is perhaps another descriptor I would use. Would not recommend this to the squeamish as although the medical situations depicted are entirely unrealistic, they take that line into unsympathetically gruesomely satyric. Perhaps that is what the writers and producers were going for?  Also, wish I had realized the episodes were only 1/2 hour as I would not have bought it at that price as was thinking it was hour-long episodes.
