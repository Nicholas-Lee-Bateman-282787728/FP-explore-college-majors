Then 1/2 the video is adults doing the things the cartoon characters talk or sing about. My baby lost interest before the fun part even started. When I finally got him to watch it, it switched from all the bright colors to the parents reading or talking to their kids, and he lost interest again. If it was just the bright colored characters and less of the adults showing you or telling you, it might be better. Babies like to watch other babies, but adults reading or talking just isn't that interesting to them in a video. It's not one of our favorites because of that.",3,"Parts are good, more for parents",1186185600,"08 4, 2007",2007,703,"['doctor', 'introducing', 'three', 'times', 'kids', 'part', 'then', 'lecture', 'interacting', 'baby', 'Then', '1/2', 'video', 'adults', 'doing', 'things', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'talk', 'sing', 'baby', 'lost', 'interest', 'fun', 'part', 'even', 'started', 'When', 'finally', 'got', 'watch', 'switched', 'bright', 'colors', 'parents', 'reading', 'talking', 'kids', 'lost', 'interest', 'again', 'was', 'just', 'bright', 'colored', 'characters', 'less', 'adults', 'showing', 'telling', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'Babies', 'watch', 'other', 'babies', 'adults', 'reading', 'talking', 'just', ""n't"", 'that', 'interesting', 'video', 'not', 'one', 'favorites']",N/A

952514,A239EHZAX0KMSA,B000BYA4EC,C. Reyer,"[4, 8]","This is very much like a Board Book for babies. It has what most babies at about 6 months are interested in: other babies, music and red (Elmo). The video is great for new parents who aren't quite sure what to do with their baby.If you can get them to watch it, this would also be a good tool for new fathers who want to be involved but aren't sure what to do. Much of what is in this video is very similiar to recent Baby and Father classes (minus the basic care of babies part).This video is primarily a springboard for interacting with babies and toddlers rather than a babysitter. Some people may use it that way anyway, but it is most effective when a parent is watching it with the baby interactively.",5,Video Board Book,1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,707,"['very', 'much', 'Board', 'Book', 'babies', 'what', 'most', 'babies', '6', 'months', 'are', 'interested', 'other', 'babies', 'music', 'red', 'Elmo', 'video', 'great', 'new', 'parents', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'baby.If', 'can', 'get', 'watch', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'good', 'tool', 'new', 'fathers', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'involved', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'Much', 'what', 'video', 'very', 'similiar', 'recent', 'Baby', 'Father', 'classes', 'basic', 'care', 'babies', 'part', '.This', 'video', 'primarily', 'springboard', 'interacting', 'babies', 'toddlers', 'rather', 'babysitter', 'people', 'may', 'use', 'way', 'anyway', 'most', 'effective', 'when', 'parent', 'watching', 'baby', 'interactively']",N/A

We wanted real life for our daughter and were good at reading aloud and playing patty-cake.  Then, when our baby was 10 months old, my brother, who works for a TV station, gave us this DVD. And to be polite, we watched it.This is not a show to teach your child how to watch television. The announcer even says, ""Watch this with your child; then, turn it off."" This is a program wherein the parents can learn to sing with and play with babies. Sad as it is, some parents don't know how or think it's too hard. The songs here are cute, easy, and catchy,and it will be easy for even the most self-concious caregiver to play peekaboo or baby-in-the-mirror with the tools this DVD provides.  And even if you did a lot of babysitting as a child, it's a good thing to learn new songs to do as the years go by.The puppetry is amazing (they really made the facial expressions and body movements look baby-like), and Brandy and her daughter as the wrap around were sincere and heart warming.Some parents will use this as a baby sitter anyway (hence the one star deduction) but those are the ones who would no matter what, and if you are gonna use a DVD that way this is a better choice than Barney or Power Rangers.This really can be a fun and useful video if used right.",4,I'll probably burn in h*** for liking this,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,1319,"['toys', 'batteries', 'TV', 'husband', 'said', 'wanted', 'real', 'life', 'daughter', 'were', 'good', 'reading', 'aloud', 'playing', 'patty-cake', 'Then', 'when', 'baby', 'was', '10', 'months', 'old', 'brother', 'who', 'TV', 'station', 'gave', 'DVD', 'be', 'polite', 'watched', 'it.This', 'not', 'show', 'teach', 'child', 'how', 'watch', 'television', 'announcer', 'even', 'Watch', 'child', 'then', 'turn', 'off', 'program', 'parents', 'can', 'learn', 'sing', 'play', 'babies', 'Sad', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'songs', 'here', 'are', 'cute', 'easy', 'catchy', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'even', 'most', 'self-concious', 'caregiver', 'play', 'peekaboo', 'baby-in-the-mirror', 'tools', 'DVD', 'even', 'did', 'lot', 'babysitting', 'child', 'good', 'thing', 'learn', 'new', 'songs', 'do', 'years', 'go', 'by.The', 'puppetry', 'amazing', 'really', 'made', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'movements', 'look', 'baby-like', 'Brandy', 'daughter', 'wrap', 'were', 'sincere', 'heart', 'warming.Some', 'parents', 'will', 'use', 'baby', 'sitter', 'anyway', 'hence', 'one', 'star', 'deduction', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'would', 'matter', 'what', 'are', 'gon', 'use', 'DVD', 'way', 'better', 'choice', 'Barney', 'Power', 'Rangers.This', 'really', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'useful', 'video', 'used', 'right']",N/A

They are my 2-year old's favorites and my 3-year old loves them as well. All three of the DVD's are very cute (although the Make Music Together is the favorite of my children). Features Sesame characters (Elmo, Cookie Monster, Prairie Dawn, and Big Bird) as babies and has many cute and catchy songs. GREAT set of movies for your little one! You won't regret this purchase!
