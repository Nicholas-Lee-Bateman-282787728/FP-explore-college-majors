Gordon,"[0, 0]","This neo-realist style examination of a struggling Iranian family, by Iran's best knownfemale film-maker has a quiet complexity, and an anger simmering just under its surface.It also makes one question just how closed a society Iran really was in 2001, when thisfilm was voted best of the year by Iranian film critics.  Although, sadly, things look likethey have gone backward since this film was made, when free elections were just startingto becoming a reality.A few twists are familiar or `melodramatic', but Bani-Etemad handles them with a subtlereality that seems to spring from her background making documentaries, and keeps themfrom feeling heavy handed.While I was watching it I liked it, but it was only after its startling ending that I foundmyself deeply shaken and thinking.",5,One of those films that really snuck up on me.,1317340800,"09 30, 2011",2011,786,"['neo-realist', 'style', 'examination', 'struggling', 'Iranian', 'family', 'Iran', 'best', 'knownfemale', 'film-maker', 'quiet', 'complexity', 'anger', 'simmering', 'just', 'surface.It', 'also', 'one', 'question', 'just', 'how', 'closed', 'society', 'Iran', 'really', 'was', '2001', 'when', 'thisfilm', 'was', 'voted', 'best', 'year', 'Iranian', 'film', 'critics', 'sadly', 'things', 'look', 'likethey', 'have', 'gone', 'backward', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'when', 'free', 'elections', 'were', 'just', 'startingto', 'becoming', 'reality.A', 'few', 'twists', 'are', 'familiar', 'melodramatic', 'Bani-Etemad', 'subtlereality', 'spring', 'background', 'making', 'documentaries', 'themfrom', 'feeling', 'heavy', 'handed.While', 'was', 'watching', 'liked', 'was', 'only', 'startling', 'ending', 'foundmyself', 'deeply', 'shaken', 'thinking']",Under the Skin of the City

Childress ""wine goblet""","[1, 1]","Having lived in this part of the world for some time, I was able to appreciate most of the cultural details that perhaps others in an American audience might miss.  Still, the plot confused me in places.  But the film is worthwhile for a couple of particularly good scenes.  The first is when Abbas finally gets up the courage to declare his feelings for the young woman at the office - he overflows with happiness, cheering himself on in the elevator, and dancing around his mother's home with his sister's wedding dress as a partner.  For a moment, he captures the bliss felt in Gene Kelly's ""Singin' in the Rain.""  The second powerful scene is the ending, which turns the spotlight onto the viewer of the film.",4,Some Good Scenes,1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,713,"['Having', 'lived', 'part', 'world', 'time', 'was', 'able', 'appreciate', 'most', 'cultural', 'details', 'perhaps', 'others', 'American', 'audience', 'might', 'miss', 'Still', 'plot', 'confused', 'places', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'couple', 'particularly', 'good', 'scenes', 'first', 'when', 'Abbas', 'finally', 'up', 'courage', 'declare', 'feelings', 'young', 'woman', 'office', 'happiness', 'cheering', 'elevator', 'dancing', 'mother', 'home', 'sister', 'wedding', 'dress', 'partner', 'moment', 'bliss', 'felt', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'Singin', 'Rain', 'second', 'powerful', 'scene', 'ending', 'spotlight', 'viewer', 'film']",Under the Skin of the City
793871,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B00015YV36,Muzzlehatch,"[0, 0]","Though Iranian cinema has gone mostly from strength to strength for roughly 30 years, I suspect that when the history of this time is written a generation or two from now, it will be the period from 1997-2005, coinciding with the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, that will be looked on as the apex.  From this westerner's viewpoint it's clear that censorship in the arts, and film in particular, was ever-so-slightly relaxed during this time, and many filmmakers, in particular women and men dealing with feminist/gender issues, were able to make much stronger and more overt political and moral statements with less fear of reprisal and repression than in most of the rest of these three decades.Rakhshan Bani-Etemad is probably the best-known female Iranian-born director whose last name is not Makhmalbaf, and this is her most well-known film, made smack-dab in the middle of this ""thawing"" period.  The story of a family (an ineffective father and a tough mother, both around 60, and two sons and two daughters) with multiple crises affecting it all at the same time is a familiar one in Iranian cinema but this is an angrier and more pessimistic film than usual, even in a society that seems to thrive on depression (at least in it's cinema).  Also fairly unusual is the overt depiction of drug addiction and the dangers fraught with dealing, and the complexities of spousal abuse in a society where the woman is typically blamed for being beaten.It's not totally bleak, thanks in part to the liveliness of some of the younger characters - who haven't yet lost hope - and it's never so dreary as to lack some entertainment value, with a variety of acting styles at work and an excellent physical portrait of a rapidly-modernizing Tehran at odds with a stuck-in-the-mud patriarchal, hyper-conservative society.  And like many dramas, it does end up rather more crushing and bleak at the end if only because there has been hope held out during the course of the movie for some real change.  Iranian filmmakers may have had some cause to believe in a better possible Iran around the turn of the last century, but they were never sanguine about it and alas their fears had more foundation than their hopes.  If you enjoy this film, or are looking for more about this period - and women's roles in Iranian society in particular - I would also highly recommend Ms. Bani-Etemad's next film, the documentaryOur Times, which deals with the 2001 Presidential election and the hopes of many poor Iranian women for reforms and a greater stake in their political process.",5,Hard times in Tehran,1380153600,"09 26, 2013",2013,2562,"['Iranian', 'cinema', 'gone', 'mostly', 'strength', 'strength', 'roughly', '30', 'years', 'suspect', 'when', 'history', 'time', 'written', 'generation', 'two', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'period', '1997-2005', 'coinciding', 'presidency', 'Mohammad', 'Khatami', 'will', 'be', 'looked', 'apex', 'westerner', 'viewpoint', 'clear', 'censorship', 'arts', 'film', 'particular', 'was', 'ever-so-slightly', 'relaxed', 'time', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'particular', 'women', 'men', 'dealing', 'feminist/gender', 'issues', 'were', 'able', 'make', 'much', 'stronger', 'more', 'overt', 'political', 'moral', 'statements', 'less', 'fear', 'reprisal', 'repression', 'most', 'rest', 'three', 'decades.Rakhshan', 'Bani-Etemad', 'probably', 'best-known', 'female', 'Iranian-born', 'director', 'last', 'name', 'not', 'Makhmalbaf', 'most', 'well-known', 'film', 'made', 'smack-dab', 'middle', 'thawing', 'period', 'story', 'family', 'ineffective', 'father', 'tough', 'mother', '60', 'two', 'sons', 'two', 'daughters', 'multiple', 'crises', 'affecting', 'same', 'time', 'familiar', 'one', 'Iranian', 'cinema', 'angrier', 'more', 'pessimistic', 'film', 'usual', 'even', 'society', 'thrive', 'depression', 'least', 'cinema', 'Also', 'fairly', 'unusual', 'overt', 'depiction', 'drug', 'addiction', 'dangers', 'fraught', 'dealing', 'complexities', 'spousal', 'abuse', 'society', 'where', 'woman', 'typically', 'blamed', 'being', 'beaten.It', 'not', 'totally', 'bleak', 'thanks', 'part', 'liveliness', 'younger', 'characters', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'lost', 'hope', 'never', 'so', 'dreary', 'lack', 'entertainment', 'value', 'variety', 'acting', 'styles', 'work', 'excellent', 'physical', 'portrait', 'rapidly-modernizing', 'Tehran', 'odds', 'stuck-in-the-mud', 'patriarchal', 'hyper-conservative', 'society', 'many', 'dramas', 'end', 'up', 'rather', 'more', 'crushing', 'bleak', 'end', 'only', 'been', 'hope', 'held', 'out', 'course', 'movie', 'real', 'change', 'Iranian', 'filmmakers', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'cause', 'believe', 'better', 'possible', 'Iran', 'turn', 'last', 'century', 'were', 'never', 'sanguine', 'alas', 'fears', 'had', 'more', 'foundation', 'hopes', 'enjoy', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'period', 'women', 'roles', 'Iranian', 'society', 'particular', 'would', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Ms.', 'Bani-Etemad', 'next', 'film', 'documentaryOur', 'Times', '2001', 'Presidential', 'election', 'hopes', 'many', 'poor', 'Iranian', 'women', 'reforms', 'greater', 'stake', 'political', 'process']",Under the Skin of the City

Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[0, 0]","After working long hours in a Tehran textile factory, Mrs. Tuba negotiates the lives of her troubled children, her reclusive husband, and an abused neighbor. Her children have various problems including skipping school, attending political demonstrations, staying in an abusive marriage, and constantly spending money on presents and expensive dinners. Much attention is focused on Abbas, the eldest child, who is trying desperately trying to obtain a Japanese visa to earn enough money to enable his elder mother to stop working. In between his work assignments Abbas admires an office worker and showers her with attention and gifts.Throughout this film there are frequent scenes depicting the commotion of the busy highways of Tehran and its beautiful streets and shop fronts. Also included are numerous insights into the Iranian society and cultural customs. Unfortunately, I don't feel that this is a particularly strong film. The beginning was quite confusing and muddled together as the characters' relationships were never adequately defined. It wasn't until about halfway through that the plot started to come together. I believe that many nuances were lost in translation and that if I were more acquainted with this culture than I would have understood more of what occurred. I sincerely wonder if this film were taken out of the exotic location would there remain anything sufficient of the plot?
