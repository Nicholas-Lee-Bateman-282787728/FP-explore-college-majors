Yet, there's another side of her that's yet to be discovered along with the arival of Arima Souichirou, intelligent, smart, kind, athletic, charismatic... everything that Yukino had pretended to be all her life... who quickly becomes a strong competition, like getting better grade than Yukino without trying.  At first, Yukino sees Souichirou as her opponant, someone she has to beat.  She competes with him on everything, trying to regain the title of ""model student.""  She eventually gets her title back by studying harder and harder.  Things are now going well for Yunkino..However..as time passed, Yukino starts to develop a crush on Souichirou.  The other side of Yukino, the image of a lazy, selfserving average girl is then accidentally revealed to Souichirou when he pays a visit at Yukino's house.  He then starts ""threatening"" her of revealing her secret unless she does homework for him.  Yukino soon discovered that Souichirou is only using her as she gives up her feeling for him and refuses to do his homework ever again.  Surprisingly, Souichirou goes after her and tells her that he has feelings for her, and the whole ""blackmailing"" thing is only an excuse for him to get to know her better.  So they starts going out...and more interesting stuff happens. (i dont wanna spoil more stuff)His and her circumstances is a definitely a masterpiece, it's not merely a romance, it really draws you into the actual anime.  I didn't think i would like it at first, because i'm usually into Magic/Romance, but this anime is much more.  Let's just say...It gives you like a fuzzy feeling, and you would want to watch it again and again.  It also tells you that to always trust your instincts, even though perfect relationship is vague, if you try, you will be able to find it n-n;;",5,Hm...Masterpiece? definitely!,1059264000,"07 27, 2003",2003,1897,"['Yukino', 'model', 'student', 'everyone', 'else', 'eyes', 'Straight', 'A', 'perfect', 'personality', 'get', 'others', 'Yet', 'side', 'yet', 'be', 'discovered', 'arival', 'Arima', 'Souichirou', 'intelligent', 'smart', 'kind', 'athletic', 'charismatic', 'everything', 'Yukino', 'had', 'pretended', 'be', 'life', 'who', 'quickly', 'strong', 'competition', 'getting', 'better', 'grade', 'Yukino', 'trying', 'first', 'Yukino', 'Souichirou', 'opponant', 'someone', 'beat', 'everything', 'trying', 'regain', 'title', 'model', 'student', 'eventually', 'title', 'back', 'studying', 'harder', 'harder', 'Things', 'are', 'now', 'going', 'well', 'Yunkino..However..as', 'time', 'passed', 'Yukino', 'develop', 'crush', 'Souichirou', 'other', 'side', 'Yukino', 'image', 'lazy', 'selfserving', 'average', 'girl', 'then', 'accidentally', 'revealed', 'Souichirou', 'when', 'visit', 'Yukino', 'house', 'then', 'threatening', 'her', 'revealing', 'secret', 'homework', 'Yukino', 'soon', 'discovered', 'Souichirou', 'only', 'using', 'up', 'feeling', 'refuses', 'do', 'homework', 'ever', 'again', 'Surprisingly', 'Souichirou', 'feelings', 'whole', 'blackmailing', 'thing', 'only', 'excuse', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'starts', 'going', 'out', 'more', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'happens', 'i', 'dont', 'wan', 'spoil', 'more', 'stuff', 'circumstances', 'definitely', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'merely', 'romance', 'really', 'actual', 'anime', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'first', 'i', ""'m"", 'usually', 'Magic/Romance', 'anime', 'much', 'more', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'also', 'always', 'trust', 'instincts', 'even', 'perfect', 'relationship', 'vague', 'try', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'n-n']",His And Her Circumstances 1-5

I really liked Niea and I was interested in trying some other Anime comedies (Amazon reccomended this).There is alot to like about ""His and Her Circumstances"". The music is fantastic, the characters are interesting & likeable, and the comedy is funny. The animation is a bit rough (compared to Niea) but it was still very good.The few flaws: First, the plot was too predictable at times. Far too many times the plot surrounds the introduction of a new evil character, who later becomes good and joins Yukino and Arimas cool group of friends. Second, the synopsis of the previous episodes. Oh my god, how annoying it is to review the entire series before every new episode. Third, the ending. What some might interpret as creative and abstract, I found lazy and annoying.Still for all it's flaws, I was still impressed with this cartoon.

741633,A3VDC23HUFETP5,B00008G6GK,Jeremy Moses,"[10, 20]","I seem to be of a distinct minority opinion about this show. Granted, there are some very good qualities about it-- the artwork (for the most part) is incredible, there's a reasonable amount of character appeal, and one of the later episodes was so good it left me speechless as the credits rolled. But good artwork and occasional flashes of inspiration can't carry a whole show, and when the interminable final episode drunkenly staggered to its close, I thought, ""you couldn't pay me enough to watch that again"". The basic premise is a blossoming romance between two high school students, Yukino and Arima. That's a concept that can turn into a cliche very easily, and the creators seem bent on putting in enough innovation that that won't happen. Their efforts, however, either fall flat, or have the opposite effect of being so badly done they actually worsen the show.The first thing I noticed when watching this, is that all subtlety is thrown to the wind. Yukino and Arima both have more to them than at first meets the eye. At least, they would if they didn't come right out in the first couple of episodes and explicitly tell us everything about their personalities, and what they're really like (as in, ""my name is Yukino. I like to fool people into thinking I'm a nice, good student, but really, I just like being the best and having everyone's admiration""). It would be nice to slowly learn about the lead characters, as their subtleties and flaws gradually become apparent. Instead, it's violently shoved down our throats in the first three episodes.I stated earlier that character appeal is a strength of the series. I should clarify: appeal of the secondary characters is a strength of the series, and they don't get nearly enough face time (Arima is bland, and Yukino is bland with an occasional obnoxious flair). The secondary cast is likeable and funny, and they have a surprising amount of depth for the amount of screen time they receive. But too often, the show subjects us to Yukino and Arima endlessly babbling on about how much they love each other. The high point of the series is definitely the two or three episodes when Arima is out of town. That, briefly, gives the secondary characters a chance to shine.On to the plot: His and Her Circumstances, obviously, has a fairly mundane story, since it tries to be realistic in what it portrays. In a better show, this might result in gripping, subtle psychological drama. That was probably the idea in this series, but what we get instead is a slew of boring romance/ everyday life scenes which either induce yawns or eye rolling. Ex: It's the school sports fest, and everyone is really busy setting up. Yukino wants to spend time with Arima, but what's this? He's so busy, she has trouble finding him! What will she do?! Everyone she asks has seen him somewhere, but no one knows where he's gone! Oh no!! Then, she finds him. (after about half an episode of this)The fact that the creators seem to really take this seriously would be funny, if it wasn't such a pain to sit through, and if scenes like that weren't quite so common.Then, there are the recaps. Recap episodes are an unfortunately common convention of anime, and sometimes  they're used as filler, when the creator falls short on ideas and innovation. That was certainly the case here. Most series which sport this convention have just one recap episode. His and Her Circumstances takes it to a whole new level, with one full recap episode and two half recap episodes. What's more, the later recap material is presented in a way such as to make it impossible to follow if you haven't recently seen the episodes. It's clear the director didn't really care about recapping anything. He needed filler, and this handy little time waster presented itself. Toward the end, the episodes become less and less coherent. Some of them inexplicably start off with a  summary of Japan's faltering economic conditions (don't ask me why). Then the animation budget got slashed, resulting briefly in the hilarious use of paper cutouts of the characters filmed against real time backgrounds. The last episodes degenerate into still pictures of the characters, garbled monologues, and random references to earlier events. This does not serve any higher artistic purpose whatsoever, although some might try to tell you otherwise. Believe them at your own risk.In closing, while His and Her Circumstances isn't an entire flop, it's certainly enough of one to warrant one star. Many of the problems I mentioned earlier are isolated incidents but, along with others like them, they help to form a fatally flawed whole. Yukino and Arima can be summed up by one word: boring. Teen angst in relationships can be very painful but, as this show proves, that doesn't always make it moving, brilliant, or fun to watch.",1,at least hear me out,1075334400,"01 29,

I wasn't expecting an earth-shattering, question-your-motives-on-life type of anime, but rather a simple love story.  What I ended up getting was kind of a poor conglomeration of the two.  They start by developing the two main characters thoroughly, but then, after the two main characters get together and begin to build their relationship, the series begins to feel fake and fall apart.  Yes, they did try to represent some of the deeper aspects of relationship, and kudos for that, but there was so much else bad about the series that it is not worth a second watch.  First, and most annoyingly, there are recaps in virtually EVERY SINGLE episode that take up a good portion of the time in each episode.  This is ""cute"" at first, but gets really boring after a while, after you realise you can recite the whole thing by heart, probably in the original Japanese.  And, for all you fans of recapping-so-you-don't-have-to-develop-anything, there is an ENTIRE ADDITIONAL EPISODE for your perusing satisfaction.  Watch it and skip the first 13 or so.  After the recap extravaganza, the whole series began to crumble.  They made several attempts to introduce new characters and perspectives, and failed miserably on the follow-through, creating a bunch of halfway done story lines and too many loose ends towards the end to make this an enjoyable series.  Rent or borrow this one.
