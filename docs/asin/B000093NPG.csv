751437,A3E5OY3YLZMOA9,B000093NPG,"Keith A. Jones ""Sonic Jones... I'm Kind Of A ...","[5, 8]",The concept of Jing- King of bandits alone is five stars. He's a guy with the swagger of a well-experienced man in the world of stealing but he's a teen. The mere thought of his name in a town make owners of valuable objects pack extra security. Jing doesn't always go after stuff that's worth money sometimes it will be priceless but he's a cool kid and sees it for it's beauty and not it's worth. This is no doubt a hot series but what's the problem with it? Well for one almost everything is a little too easy for Jing.Even though he's the king of bandits it would be nice to see him have to work a little harder instead of him just showing up at the site and using his trusty sidekick Kir to blast away the enemies with one shot. It's almost as if it's a kids series at times. Then there's the problem with a few episodes that are just plain stupid and pointless and take you nowhere in the story. Even with the flaws I pointed out Jing is still amazing. The animation is fantastic and the story is pretty good but I watched it mostly to see what Jing was going up against. It's a good series but not a great one and it needs some work but it's still very entertaining.,4,It Could Have Been A Five Star Series,1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,1173,"['concept', 'Jing-', 'King', 'bandits', 'alone', 'five', 'stars', 'guy', 'swagger', 'well-experienced', 'man', 'world', 'stealing', 'teen', 'mere', 'thought', 'name', 'town', 'make', 'owners', 'valuable', 'objects', 'pack', 'extra', 'security', 'Jing', ""n't"", 'always', 'go', 'stuff', 'worth', 'money', 'will', 'be', 'priceless', 'cool', 'kid', 'beauty', 'not', 'worth', 'doubt', 'hot', 'series', 'what', 'problem', 'Well', 'one', 'almost', 'everything', 'little', 'too', 'easy', 'Jing.Even', 'king', 'bandits', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'have', 'work', 'little', 'harder', 'instead', 'just', 'showing', 'up', 'site', 'using', 'trusty', 'sidekick', 'Kir', 'blast', 'away', 'enemies', 'one', 'shot', 'almost', 'kids', 'series', 'times', 'Then', 'problem', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'pointless', 'take', 'nowhere', 'story', 'Even', 'flaws', 'pointed', 'out', 'Jing', 'still', 'amazing', 'animation', 'fantastic', 'story', 'pretty', 'good', 'watched', 'mostly', 'see', 'what', 'Jing', 'was', 'going', 'up', 'good', 'series', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'work', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining']",N/A

751439,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B000093NPG,RavenRing,"[10, 12]","This series is about a boy named Jing who, as the title suggests, is King of Bandits (as in skill, not through election). His only companion is a bird named Kir who can bond with Jing's arm to form a sort of magical cannon for the attack ""Kir Royale"". This attack is a little repetitive (as it is his only attack), however, it isn't very long and it looks cool. Jing is an interesting character, very calm and laid back. His demeanor is always that of someone who knows exactly what is going on and what to do. It isn't easy to tell if this is true or not.As far as I can tell, there is no overall plot to this series. It is a bunch of short stories, most only lasting for a single episode (there are 13 episodes in all). While I would have enjoyed an actual story line (Jing is a fun character with lots of mystery surrounding him), I really liked the freedom that short stories gave. I looked forward to each episode, but it wasn't urgent for me to see the next episode because I just NEEDED to see what happened next. All of the stories excluding one were very entertaining and even that one wasn't too bad.Both the English and the Japanese dubs were good, though I preferred the Japanese version as Jing sounded more like a kid (as he is supposed to be). The English voice just sounded a bit too old for the character.All in all, I would really recommend this series to anyone. So go see it!***Update 11/05/10***If you enjoyed Jing - King of the Bandits, rejoice to know that the OVA is now available on DVD.King of Bandit Jing in Seventh Heaven OVAis 3 episodes/90 minutes of extra bandit fun.

751440,AMJYNF6FI9JDM,B000093NPG,"Saito Hajime ""My reviews are short and sweet....","[0, 0]","I remember hearing the title a few times, and was always intrigued by it. Recently I bought the complete series plus the ova off of rightstuf after reading a ton of reviews that praise this show for being really fun, and having great animation.First, the animation is anything but great. I think people confuse animation with artwork. The artwork is nice and unique, but the animation is as good as pokemon. Each episode seems to try new things with the artwork, and it is very refreshing. The animation uses a lot of action lines, picture panning, and a lot of other ""cost-cutting"" measures.Not impressed.Each episode has a completely different storyline,(besides a couple 2-parters). This doesn't bother me at all, in fact its nice. Unfortunately the story is just mediocre. The characters are undeveloped, and there is little to no action. There are some jokes, which weren't very funny, but helped keep it fresh.Music is nothing special. The opening and endings are great.Here's the thing though, it IS fun. I can't deny that. I've seen a lot of anime shows that are mediocre, and take themselves too seriously, but Jing doesn't do that. It's confident and knows its a wacky, fun show. It never felt boring, and was always interesting.It's like junk food anime. You don't feel like you had a great experience, but you don't feel like you wasted your time either. You might watch a Cops marathon on tv, but you aren't going to want Cops on dvd.I'm happy to own this show, but with Funimation's new S.A.V.E. program, you can get an entire series,better than this for less than I paid.

You also get to witness some of his abilities, that he and his partner share, which looks pretty cool and seems to have a devastating effect on the opposing side.In episode one you meet Jing and Kir. Jing comes off as the calm, determined type. He of course turns out to be king of the bandits (as the title suggests), and it's easy to see why. He steals a rare stone that another bandit keeps in his mouth, without the guy knowing. All just to prove a point. Kir, is his side-kick albatross. Kir's main point of the show seems to be your comedy relief, as he wisecracks and has a perverted needs to stare at womens chests.Breakdown:The animation is smooth and has it's 'eye-candy' moments. The story seems to be that of a slow developing but entertaining one none-the less. Think along the lines of One Piece, only not as cheesy (that's not to say One Piece is bad, I like One Piece as well, but I think I like this one more. ).I hope by reading my review, you come to your own decision.

Mind you not the I'm goign to kill and rape everything in sight bandit, more along the lines of gentlemen thief like Lupin III except twice as smooth and three times as cool.Each episode comes in pars that are pretty much isolated from each other. Jing is likeable and cool, Kire is Kire. The series the only bad thing about the series is that it focuses to much on Kire, he steals the show and I didn't reallyl ike him. The girls are also likeable and cute each different in a set number of ways. The thing that bring the series down is that its based off a perfect manga, and duplicating perfecting isn't easy. Many of the things in the manga that were hillarious come off flat, then there is the fact that Jing repeats the same line everytime he shots is Kire Royal. The animation is a throw back to the eighties, not in quality but in character designs which is nice. quality wise it's pretty good the voice acting is okay same with the music. the plots are intersting and suspensefull but I always end up feeling sorry for the girl that ends up falling for Jing and getting left behind never to see him again.

The adventures of the child thief were entertaining to read. Now they have the entire series on DVD. When I discovered this I was more than ecstatic and it was a great price to boot.This set gives all of the episodes to the Jing anime series. The voice acting gets a bit iffy sometimes and there are a few mistakes made in the first episode but these problems quickly disappear. The only other problem with this series is the fact that, unlike the manga it's based off of, this anime is a bit short so you might not get to see some of your favorite adventures come to life.The adventures that they do animate are all nicely done and capture the general weirdness of Jing's world perfectly. The colors are vibrant and the animation is pretty solid. While not a masterpiece, Jing is still a great anime to kill some time with for veterans or newcomers alike.

751444,A3QAX4HDD8IAB8,B000093NPG,"William Gersztyn ""Spud McFry""","[0, 0]","I start this review by saying, that out of the 4 DVD's this one is the worst of them.  Out of the 3 episodes on it only one of them is actually good.The first episode is &quot;Don't drop the Porvora&quot;.  In this episode Jing and Kir are searching for the Sunstone which is said to be in the land of Sungria.  On their way to Sungria they are given an offer to take 2 creatures called Porvora's to Sungria.  These are creatures than can explode if their irritated and are often used as explosives. Jing accepts the offer, despite Izarra's (The girl in this story.) attempts to change his mind.This single episode was also in the manga, and it was a much longer more drawn out story than in the anime. Which could have easily been a 2 part story here. That would've been much better than including the next episode that was on here.  Because as it is packing everything into one episode, things felt WAY too rushed.The next episode &quot;The Musical Island of Coco Oco&quot; is another original episode and is the worst episode on this DVD. (And in my opinion the worst in the series.) Jing &amp; Kir visit the musical Island of Coco Oco, a place where the people really love music. They are in search of a legendary Ocarina that is said to be found there, but upon there arrival Kir gets irritated with Jing, who doesn't even seem interested in finding the treasure and splits up to search on his own.(And to find some beautiful girls.) And in turn ends up bumping into this episodes girl.We see a lot of Kir by himself and trying to help this girl out.While at first this episode does seem kind of promising with the introduction to the musical island as we see virtually everything on the island making some kind of musical sound. But even that ends up falling short, because besides at the end we don't see it epxand upon that at all.The last episode on here totally took me by surprise. (I'm sorry I can't remember the name of it.) This is the last of the original episodes, and as the previous 2 weren't very good, I wasn't expecting much out of this one.In this story Jing and Kir accidentally get off at the wrong stop on there way to Zaza (This is the only time you every see any sign of continuity in the series.) and in turn end up discovering Bluwari, the land of the Porvora. Which is watched over by the lovely Elixir ( I wound up really liking her a lot for some reason.) who takes care of the Porvora.  But while Jing and Kir are being shown around the place there are thieves at work trying to bust in because they believe there is some great teasure hidden there.I really liked this episode because it had a lot of mystery to it, and the land of the Porvoras was a much cooler place than I thought it would be.As with the last DVD this one has a few spelling errors in it. The only major one was getting Izarra's last name totally wrong.  It says it Danbura, but it's actually Tumbler.In that respect though this DVD wasn't really that bad, but be prepared, because it gets really bad in the last DVD.",3,The worst of the 4 DVD's.,1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,3020,"['start', 'review', 'saying', '4', 'DVD', 'one', 'worst', '3', 'episodes', 'only', 'one', 'actually', 'good.The', 'first', 'episode', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'drop', 'Porvora', 'quot', 'episode', 'Jing', 'Kir', 'are', 'searching', 'Sunstone', 'said', 'be', 'land', 'Sungria', 'way', 'Sungria', 'are', 'given', 'offer', 'take', '2', 'creatures', 'called', 'Porvora', 'Sungria', 'are', 'creatures', 'can', 'explode', 'irritated', 'are', 'often', 'used', 'explosives', 'Jing', 'offer', 'Izarra', 'girl', 'story', 'change', 'mind.This', 'single', 'episode', 'was', 'also', 'manga', 'was', 'much', 'longer', 'more', 'drawn', 'out', 'story', 'anime', 'Which', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', '2', 'part', 'story', 'here', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'better', 'including', 'next', 'episode', 'was', 'here', 'packing', 'everything', 'one', 'episode', 'things', 'felt', 'WAY', 'too', 'rushed.The', 'next', 'episode', 'quot', 'Musical', 'Island', 'Coco', 'Oco', 'quot', 'original', 'episode', 'worst', 'episode', 'DVD', 'opinion', 'worst', 'series', 'Jing', 'amp', 'Kir', 'musical', 'Island', 'Coco', 'Oco', 'place', 'where', 'people', 'really', 'love', 'music', 'are', 'search', 'legendary', 'Ocarina', 'said', 'be', 'found', 'there', 'arrival', 'Kir', 'irritated', 'Jing', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'interested', 'finding', 'treasure', 'up', 'search', 'own', 'find', 'beautiful', 'girls', 'turn', 'up', 'bumping', 'girl.We', 'see', 'lot', 'Kir', 'trying', 'help', 'girl', 'out.While', 'first', 'episode', 'seem', 'kind', 'promising', 'introduction', 'musical', 'island', 'see', 'virtually', 'everything', 'island', 'making', 'kind', 'musical', 'sound', 'even', 'up', 'falling', 'short', 'besides', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'epxand', 'last', 'episode', 'here', 'totally', 'took', 'surprise', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'last', 'original', 'episodes', 'previous', '2', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'one.In', 'story', 'Jing', 'Kir', 'accidentally', 'get', 'off', 'wrong', 'stop', 'way', 'Zaza', 'only', 'time', 'see', 'sign', 'continuity', 'series', 'turn', 'end', 'up', 'discovering', 'Bluwari', 'land', 'Porvora', 'Which', 'watched', 'lovely', 'Elixir', 'wound', 'up', 'really', 'liking', 'lot', 'reason', 'who', 'care', 'Porvora', 'Jing', 'Kir', 'are', 'being', 'shown', 'place', 'are', 'thieves', 'work', 'trying', 'bust', 'believe', 'great', 'teasure', 'hidden', 'there.I', 'really', 'liked', 'episode', 'had', 'lot', 'mystery', 'land', 'Porvoras', 'was', 'much', 'cooler', 'place', 'thought', 'would', 'be.As', 'last', 'DVD', 'one', 'few', 'spelling', 'errors', 'only', 'major', 'one', 'was', 'getting', 'Izarra', 'last', 'name', 'totally', 'wrong', 'Danbura', 'actually', 'Tumbler.In', 'respect', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'be', 'prepared', 'really', 'bad', 'last', 'DVD']",N/A
