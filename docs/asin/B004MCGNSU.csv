1419796,A150QS4IZB3XJ,B004MCGNSU,"April Vawter ""Wilderness Photographer""","[2, 3]","This is an amazing series.  It questions nearly everything we thought we knew about ancient civilizations.  Those who view it with an open mind will learn that almost everything we have been taught has been skewed or may be outright lies about the construct of history as we know it.Clearly, the questions raised in both of these eye-opening seasons make an incredible argument that every civilization in the ancient world which has left any known remnants, was created by use of technology far beyond the technical means of those civilizations as we have been taught.  When you look at immense neolithic structures which called for raising huge, precisely-cut stone slabs weighing hundreds of tons in some cases, you can not rationally hold on to simple-minded ideas of them being cut by hard stone against softer stone, you know we've been lied to.  When you hear the canned explanations of these gargantuan pieces being raised by wooden levers and rolled to their places on logs placed like rollers, hundreds of thousands of them in some cases, you know fantasy has been presented as truth in history.Structures such as the pyramids in Egypt and elsewhere, engineered to such precision that today's best stone masons can't come close just crumble everything we've been told.  This, and another series called The Pyramid Code make cases for the pyramids being constructed as resonating generators for energy such as microwaves that could have powered huge prehistoric ""space stations.""  No mummies have ever been found in them and there is no evidence they were ever constructed as tombs.  They even make a cogent case for the King's Chamber in the Great Pyramid being used as a type of resonator.  Mathmatically and architecturally, this could actually make sense.When you look at art all over the earth from ""primitive"" cultures, astronaughts or spaceman types of images abound.  I have seen rock art in Utah and Colorado that makes ""Kachinas"" appear to be no less than representations of ancient visitors.Every hour of both seasons is worth watching multiple times if you want to really think about our cultural and even evolutionary history.  Just ponder the concept that hominids as a human-like species have been around for 300,000 year, and yet, in the past few thousand years, our brains have more than tripled in size.  It's the questions that are raised that make you question what you think or thought you knew.  If you are not bound by subjective dogma and fundamentalism, if you really want to understand who we are and how we came to be here in our current world with our science, knowledge, and abilities technologically that have come to us in the last hundred or so years, every paradigm you have ever known will be rocked.Yes there are far-fetched ideas that really have no substantiation, but they still question ideas that really don't hold up as we have been told.Question everything. Question the questions that are raised in this series, but if you have an open mind, I guarantee that if you do, almost everything you have been told about our technological past will crumble in the light of reason.If you still doubt, and use arguments such as these questions lacking ""scientific proof"" I simply challenge you to offer empirical evidence that in any way disproves 90 to 95% of what is presented.We have to go beyond what we are allowed to know.  There is so much more out there than we have been told, and so much that we have been told is simply lies, constructed to control and disinform us.

Not only are NONE of the claims backed up with credible evidence, the information is often contradictory. Even worse the people involved  simply lie about their supposed proof. Not stretch the truth, not speculate, out and out lie. I've never watched such utter nonsense before from a channel that is supposed to be about History, ugh. It's infuriating to me that people buy into this bunk. Especially when people have figured out how many of the ancients actually built their temples, etc. For example the Egyptians cut blocks of granite using toothless saws & sand as the cutting abrasive instead of teeth on the saw. No lasers were used, no aliens with secret technology were consulted. Not a real scientist is interviewed either, one guy had a PHD in extraterrestrial investigation or some such foolishness. Probably from a University he invented too. NONE of the claims of ancient peoples being visited by aliens are backed up with anything approaching facts either. The best argument is ""there's no way the ancient peruvians could have done this. The only explanation is that aliens were involved."" Um no, for examples concerning the Nazca lines the culture of the people who built the lines is ignored. Instead you have ignorant jerks from elsewhere claiming the lines are guide lines for spacecraft landings and that the top of the mountain has been sheared off. No, the mountain is a plateau. And what aliens would need miles long runways or guides when they can easily traverse interstellar space? Their proof consist of that they look like runways, they must be runways! Yay! In actuality the lines are about religion involving the desire for water and crops, not aliens. Erick Van Danniken makes the idiotic claim that the space craft made the lines when they landed. UGGGHHH!!! He contradicts himself on this point as well. If you want to see a complete debunking of this garbage, go to YouTube and search for Ancient Aliens Debunked.

1419804,A13POQPWOHV8WU,B004MCGNSU,Edgar Paternina,"[0, 0]","After seeing ANGELS AND ALIENS, it's become clearer that ancient mysteries are solved with what we have received from The Urantia Book. In fact regarding the Fallen Angels is written:""PAPER 53 - THE LUCIFER REBELLIONLucifer was a brilliant primary Lanonandek Son of Nebadon. He had experienced service in many systems, had been a high counselor of his group, and was distinguished for wisdom, sagacity, and efficiency. Lucifer was number 37 of his order, and when commissioned by the Melchizedeks, he was designated as one of the one hundred most able and brilliant personalities in more than seven hundred thousand of his kind. From such a magnificent beginning, through evil and error, he embraced sin and now is numbered as one of three System Sovereigns in Nebadon who have succumbed to the urge of self and surrendered to the sophistry of spurious personal liberty--rejection of universe allegiance and disregard of fraternal obligations, blindness to cosmic relationships.In the universe of Nebadon, the domain of Christ Michael, there are ten thousand systems of inhabited worlds. In all the history of Lanonandek Sons, in all their work throughout these thousands of systems and at the universe headquarters, only three System Sovereigns have ever been found in contempt of the government of the Creator Son.""So here we have that in fact, in ancient times we were visited by extraterrestrials, and that there are millions of inhabited worlds, but certainly the story written in Urantia Book is quite different from that one of History Channel and the theorists of the extraterrestrial hypothesis, and one point is that our combustion bodies cannot travel at such velocities necessary for space travel, something we know too from the scientific point of view.On the other hand the ""fallen angel"" that was our sovereign in the ancient past and who participated in the Lucifer Rebellion is still around here, quite interested in such theories such as the ""extraterrestrial hypothesis"" as presented in this DVD, as his life feeds from our own confusion.Well just want to share another interesting story from The Urantia Book that might be interesting for ""mating"" God & Aliens:5. ADAMSON AND RATTAHaving delineated the Nodite antecedents of the ancestry of the secondary midwayers, this narrative should now give consideration to the Adamic half of their ancestry, for the secondary midwayers are also the grandchildren of Adamson, the first-born of the violet race of Urantia.Adamson was among that group of the children of Adam and Eve who elected to remain on earth with their father and mother. Now this eldest son of Adam had often heard from Van and Amadon the story of their highland home in the north, and sometime after the establishment of the second garden he determined to go in search of this land of his youthful dreams.Adamson was 120 years old at this time and had been the father of thirty-two pure-line children of the first garden. He wanted to remain with his parents and assist them in upbuilding the second garden, but he was greatly disturbed by the loss of his mate and their children, who had all elected to go to Edentia along with those other Adamic children who chose to become wards of the Most Highs.Adamson would not desert his parents on Urantia, he was disinclined to flee from hardship or danger, but he found the associations of the second garden far from satisfying. He did much to forward the early activities of defense and construction but decided to leave for the north at the earliest opportunity. And though his departure was wholly pleasant, Adam and Eve were much grieved to lose their eldest son, to have him go out into a strange and hostile world, as they feared, never to return.A company of twenty-seven followed Adamson northward in quest of these people of his childhood fantasies. In a little over three years Adamson's party actually found the object of their adventure, and among these people he discovered a wonderful and beautiful woman, twenty years old, who claimed to be the last pure-line descendant of the Prince's staff. This woman, Ratta, said that her ancestors were all descendants of two of the fallen staff of the Prince. She was the last of her race, having no living brothers or sisters. She had about decided not to mate, had about made up her mind to die without issue, but she lost her heart to the majestic Adamson. And when she heard the story of Eden, how the predictions of Van and Amadon had really come to pass, and as she listened to the recital of the Garden default, she was encompassed with but a single thought--to marry this son and heir of Adam. And quickly the idea grew upon Adamson. In a little more than three months they were married.Adamson and Ratta had a family of sixty-seven children. They gave origin to a great line of the world's leadership, but they did something more. It should be remembered that both of these beings were really superhuman. Every fourth child born to them was of a unique order. It was often invisible. Never in the world's history had such a thing occurred. Ratta was greatly perturbed--even superstitious--but Adamson well knew of the existence of the primary midwayers, and he concluded that something similar was transpiring before his eyes. When the second strangely behaving offspring arrived, he decided to mate them, since one was male and the other female, and this is the origin of the secondary order of midwayers. Within one hundred years, before this phenomenon ceased, almost two thousand were brought into being.Edgar",5,THE URANTIA BOOK IS THE REAL EXPLANATION?,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,5555,"['seeing',

It scares alot of people who simply write it off as unbelievable. Some of the info here will be redundant, but hardly boring. If you were to ever start to check out the facts as they are presented, you will find that there's something here, and very mysterious. There is way too many ""Coincidents"" to write this off. Once you start going down this road of study, you'll find that you keep going, if you're an objective person.This Season 2 consists of 3 DVD's, and 10 hrs of Information. (each show is one hour) If you've ever investigated into this type of information, you'd find that the government covers almost all of this stuff up. I don't know if Bob Lazar will be mentioned in this set, (haven't seen the entire series yet) but his tale is fascinating. And the same government who can make a person disappear, (witness protection) has made his list of credentials disappear.Unless you are Subjective, you will really enjoy this series!The Series (season 2) consists of:  Mysterious PlacesGods & AliensUnderwater WorldsUnderground AliensAliens & the third ReichAlien TechAngels & AliensUnexplained StructuresAlien DevastationsAlien Contacts",5,Ancient Aliens Season 2,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,1257,"['Season', '2', 'Ancient', 'Aliens', 'fantastic', 'study', 'unexplained', 'very', 'well', 'documented', 'presented', 'alot', 'people', 'who', 'simply', 'write', 'off', 'unbelievable', 'info', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'redundant', 'hardly', 'boring', 'were', 'ever', 'start', 'check', 'out', 'facts', 'are', 'presented', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'here', 'very', 'mysterious', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'Coincidents', 'write', 'off', 'Once', 'start', 'going', 'down', 'road', 'study', ""'ll"", 'find', 'keep', 'going', ""'re"", 'objective', 'person.This', 'Season', '2', 'consists', '3', 'DVD', '10', 'hrs', 'Information', 'show', 'one', 'hour', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'investigated', 'type', 'information', ""'d"", 'find', 'government', 'almost', 'stuff', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Bob', 'Lazar', 'will', 'be', 'mentioned', 'set', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'entire', 'series', 'yet', 'tale', 'fascinating', 'same', 'government', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'person', 'disappear', 'witness', 'protection', 'made', 'list', 'credentials', 'are', 'Subjective', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'series', 'Series', 'season', '2', 'consists', 'Mysterious', 'PlacesGods', 'AliensUnderwater', 'WorldsUnderground', 'AliensAliens', 'third', 'ReichAlien', 'TechAngels', 'AliensUnexplained', 'StructuresAlien', 'DevastationsAlien', 'Contacts']",Ancient Aliens: Season 2

1419808,A17GWLA4BWBER0,B004MCGNSU,"Hobbit ""Hobbit""","[0, 0]","I found all the Ancient Aliens series a stretch of belief. The producers use so-called &#34;facts&#34; very loosely and bend others to suit their agenda. In one episode for example one of the presenters &#34;reminds&#34; us about the Apollo space mission where the Apollo craft crashed into the moon. He was trying to prove that the moon had been and &#34;probably still was&#34; being used by aliens as a forward base to watch the Earth. He said it was his opinion that the moon was hollow and the Apollo space craft crashing &#34;proved&#34; that it was because after the crash, the moon &#34;rang like a bell for two hours afterwards&#34;. Trouble is, I was around when the Apollo missions were going up, and I know that no Apollo crashed into or on the moon.At other places, the various presenters quote different literature to &#34;prove&#34; a point. They quote parts of the Bible extensively. In Season 4, one presenter says the Hebrew Prophet Jeremiah was speaking with some people in Jerusalem and he became hungry so he sent a young boy by the name of Abimelech out to the fields outside the walls to pick some fresh figs. Abimelech went and came back with the figs, but found that everyone he knew was gone and forty years had gone by. The presenter said the was &#34;proof&#34; that aliens were using &#34;space/time travel. Now I do not know what the presenter was using as a Holy Bible, but I looked, and that incident did not happen. At least, not in my Bible.The series is interesting in places and overall quite entertaining - as long as you totally suspend your reality - just look at it for entertainment and it is funny.",4,Ancient Aliens and conspiracy theories,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,1640,"['found', 'Ancient', 'Aliens', 'series', 'stretch', 'belief', 'producers', 'use', 'so-called', '34', 'facts', '34', 'very', 'loosely', 'bend', 'others', 'suit', 'agenda', 'one', 'episode', 'example', 'one', 'presenters', '34', '34', 'Apollo', 'space', 'mission', 'where', 'Apollo', 'craft', 'crashed', 'moon', 'was', 'trying', 'prove', 'moon', 'had', 'been', '34', 'probably', 'still', 'was', '34', 'being', 'used', 'aliens', 'forward', 'base', 'watch', 'Earth', 'said', 'was', 'opinion', 'moon', 'was', 'hollow', 'Apollo', 'space', 'craft', 'crashing', '34', 'proved', '34', 'was', 'because', 'crash', 'moon', '34', 'rang', 'bell', 'two', 'hours', 'afterwards', '34', 'Trouble', 'was', 'around', 'when', 'Apollo', 'missions', 'were', 'going', 'up', 'know', 'Apollo', 'crashed', 'moon.At', 'other', 'places', 'various', 'presenters', 'quote', 'different', 'literature', '34', 'prove', '34', 'point', 'quote', 'parts', 'Bible', 'extensively', 'Season', '4', 'one', 'presenter', 'Hebrew', 'Prophet', 'Jeremiah', 'was', 'speaking', 'people', 'Jerusalem', 'became', 'hungry', 'sent', 'young', 'boy', 'name', 'Abimelech', 'fields', 'walls', 'pick', 'fresh', 'figs', 'Abimelech', 'went', 'came', 'back', 'figs', 'found', 'everyone', 'knew', 'was', 'gone', 'forty', 'years', 'had', 'gone', 'presenter', 'said', 'was', '34', 'proof', '34', 'aliens', 'were', 'using', '34', 'space/time', 'travel', 'Now', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'presenter', 'was', 'using', 'Holy', 'Bible', 'looked', 'incident', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'least', 'not', 'Bible.The', 'series', 'interesting', 'places', 'overall', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'as', 'long', 'totally', 'suspend', 'reality', 'just', 'look', 'entertainment', 'funny']",Ancient Aliens: Season 2

The first thing people need to understand, of course, is this show is what I like to call a Historical Theory... What I mean is that it takes historical accuracies and forms a theory around them.  This theory is called the ""Ancient Astronaut"" Theory.  Season 2 picks up where season 1 left off and begins to break down the ""Ancient Astronaut"" theory into 10 episodes.  Each episode deals with a certain overall mystery that mainstream archeology and science perhaps has left open to debate.Season 2 will take you to underground temples, unexplained technology, documented alien contacts(!), explore the concept of angels, visit massive structures that seem super-human to have erected and even challenge our own understanding of World War II.Do we truly understand our ancient history and civilizations?  Do we know enough about them to make ""conclusions"" about people's way of life back then, or how things were built? This show aims to show you the alternative views on how ancient history could have been, straying from the main stream popular view.  Many main stream views are nothing more than THEORY themselves.  There is not enough concrete evidence that supports any one theory. The same could be said about Ancient Alien theories as well. As far fetched as some of the theories this show brings to the table might sound, there is that possibility of it being plausible** OVERALL **If you have never seen Ancient Aliens then I suggest you start with Season 1 or perhaps even try to catch it on the History Channel.  This way you get one or two episodes in to see if you will like the series or not before spending your $$$.  Overall, Ancient Aliens might bring some pretty far fetched theories to the table but in all honesty how far fetched are they? This is nothing more than questioning the validity of ancient knowledge we know of today.  While the theory of ""Aliens"" is a pretty extreme, the show brings up some fascinating points that does plant the seed of doubt in modern understanding of ancient civilization.*NOTE: Season 2 consists of 3 disks and a run time of 7 hrs 50minutes (average of 47mins per episode, 10 episodes)",5,A second helping of Aliens and Ancient Culture...,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,2259,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'really', 'combines', 'love', 'ancient', 'civilization', 'culture', 'love', 'aliens', 'first', 'thing', 'people', 'need', 'understand', 'course', 'show', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'Historical', 'Theory', 'What', 'mean', 'historical', 'accuracies', 'theory', 'theory', 'called', 'Ancient', 'Astronaut', 'Theory', 'Season', '2', 'up', 'where', 'season', '1', 'left', 'off', 'break', 'down', 'Ancient', 'Astronaut', 'theory', '10', 'episodes', 'episode', 'deals', 'certain', 'overall', 'mystery', 'archeology', 'science', 'perhaps', 'left', 'open', 'debate.Season', '2', 'will', 'take', 'underground', 'temples', 'unexplained', 'technology', 'documented', 'alien', 'contacts', 'explore', 'concept', 'angels', 'visit', 'massive', 'structures', 'seem', 'super-human', 'have', 'erected', 'even', 'challenge', 'own', 'understanding', 'World', 'War', 'II.Do', 'truly', 'understand', 'ancient', 'history', 'civilizations', 'Do', 'know', 'enough', 'make', 'conclusions', 'people', 'way', 'life', 'back', 'then', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'built', 'show', 'show', 'alternative', 'views', 'how', 'ancient', 'history', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'straying', 'main', 'stream', 'popular', 'view', 'Many', 'main', 'stream', 'views', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'THEORY', 'not', 'enough', 'concrete', 'evidence', 'one', 'theory', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Ancient', 'Alien', 'theories', 'as', 'well', 'far', 'fetched', 'theories', 'show', 'table', 'might', 'sound', 'possibility', 'being', 'plausible**', 'OVERALL', '**If', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Ancient', 'Aliens', 'then', 'suggest', 'start', 'Season', '1', 'perhaps', 'even', 'try', 'catch', 'History', 'Channel', 'way', 'get', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'see', 'will', 'like', 'series', 'not', 'spending', 'Overall', 'Ancient', 'Aliens', 'might', 'bring', 'pretty', 'far', 'fetched', 'theories', 'table', 'honesty', 'how', 'far', 'fetched', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'questioning', 'validity', 'ancient', 'knowledge', 'know', 'today', 'theory', 'Aliens', 'pretty', 'extreme', 'show', 'up', 'fascinating', 'points', 'plant', 'seed', 'doubt', 'modern', 'understanding', 'ancient', 'civilization', '*NOTE', 'Season', '2', 'consists', '3', 'disks', 'run', 'time', '7', 'hrs', '50minutes', 'average', '47mins', 'episode', '10', 'episodes']",Ancient Aliens: Season 2
