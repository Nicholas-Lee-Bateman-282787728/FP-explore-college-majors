478103,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,6305786372,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[12, 12]","Cindy Crawford used the routines in this video to get back into shape after her second child.  With the help of fitness expert Kathy Kaehler, she designed this workout to help new mothers ease back into fitness.  Although I've never had a child, I was interested in the variety of workouts that this video had to offer and decided to give it a try.  Throughout the video, Cindy and Kathy work out together in various settings, and Cindy is also shown working out alone in her bedroom and on the beach; at times, images of Cindy with her baby and her husband are woven in as well.  The background music includes some popular hit songs but is generally unobstrusive.Workouts A and B are both short (12 and 16 minutes, respectively), fairly gentle routines to help you slowly get used to moving your body and beginning to work your muscles.Section A starts with a gentle upper body stretch, moves into slow plies and lunges, and continues with just a bit of abs work (Kathy shows how to modify if your abs muscles were torn during labor).  This section ends with Kegel exercises and pelvic tilts, both of which are included in all three workouts.  Section B begins with a 4-minute warmup and stretch using a chair.  It then moves into a segment described as cardio, but it is really only a few minutes of side to side moves, knee lifts, etc. which can be performed with or without light weights.  Next are a few sets of squats and lunges using playing cards which you pick up off the floor, and then it's on to the floor for pelvic tilts, Kegels, and a bit more abs work.  As an intermediate exerciser, I found these first two segments too easy, and I was disappointed by the lack of cardio and upper body work.  Although I don't expect to use these sections often, they are likely to be perfect for their intended audience of those trying to get back into fitness, especially since the time went by very quickly in both workouts.To my surprise, the third section made a pretty big leap from the first two, as it was actually quite challenging.  Again, there was not much cardio work:  only two short cardio segments were included, and as in Section B, these consisted mainly of very basic moves such as knee raises and side kicks (the second segment used light weights to increase the work).  On the other hand, the toning segments in this section really worked the muscles, particularly in the upper body.  After a brief stretch, Section C begins with upper body toning using the weights and working shoulders, biceps, and triceps.  Next is the first cardio interval (4 minutes), and then a lower body focus which includes plies and lunges (again using the playing cards), glutes work (using a chair for balance), and more upper body with push-ups against the chair.  Following the second cardio interval (3 minutes), there is additional toning work for the arms using the chair, a tough push-ups segment (with Kegels inbetween), some pretty strenuous abs work, and finally, pelvic tilts.  This section ends with a 2-minute stretch.I will definitely continue using Section C when I want a full-body strength workout that I can do in a relatively short (40 minutes) period of time.  Although I think those new to or returning to exercise will enjoy the gentleness of the first two sections, keep in mind that it might take you quite awhile to work up to the third segment.  This is definitely a video which allows for growth and which can provide some benefit to all but the most advanced exercisers.",4,Three different workouts provide a nice variety,1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,3498,"['Cindy', 'Crawford', 'used', 'routines', 'video', 'get', 'back', 'shape', 'second', 'child', 'help', 'fitness', 'expert', 'Kathy', 'Kaehler', 'designed', 'workout', 'help', 'new', 'mothers', 'ease', 'back', 'fitness', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'child', 'was', 'interested', 'variety', 'workouts', 'video', 'had', 'offer', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'video', 'Cindy', 'Kathy', 'work', 'out', 'together', 'various', 'settings', 'Cindy', 'also', 'shown', 'working', 'out', 'alone', 'bedroom', 'beach', 'times', 'images', 'Cindy', 'baby', 'husband', 'are', 'woven', 'as', 'well', 'background', 'music', 'popular', 'hit', 'songs', 'generally', 'unobstrusive.Workouts', 'A', 'B', 'are', 'short', '12', '16', 'minutes', 'respectively', 'fairly', 'gentle', 'routines', 'help', 'slowly', 'get', 'used', 'moving', 'body', 'beginning', 'work', 'muscles.Section', 'gentle', 'upper', 'body', 'stretch', 'moves', 'slow', 'plies', 'lunges', 'just', 'bit', 'abs', 'work', 'Kathy', 'how', 'modify', 'abs', 'muscles', 'were', 'torn', 'labor', 'section', 'Kegel', 'exercises', 'pelvic', 'tilts', 'are', 'included', 'three', 'workouts', 'Section', 'B', '4-minute', 'warmup', 'stretch', 'using', 'chair', 'then', 'segment', 'described', 'cardio', 'really', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'side', 'side', 'moves', 'knee', 'lifts', 'etc', 'can', 'be', 'performed', 'light', 'weights', 'Next', 'are', 'few', 'sets', 'squats', 'lunges', 'using', 'playing', 'cards', 'pick', 'up', 'floor', 'then', 'floor', 'pelvic', 'tilts', 'Kegels', 'bit', 'more', 'abs', 'work', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'found', 'first', 'two', 'segments', 'too', 'easy', 'was', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'cardio', 'upper', 'body', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'use', 'sections', 'often', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'perfect', 'intended', 'audience', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'fitness', 'especially', 'time', 'went', 'very', 'quickly', 'workouts.To', 'surprise', 'third', 'section', 'made', 'pretty', 'big', 'leap', 'first', 'two', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'challenging', 'Again', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'cardio', 'work', 'only', 'two', 'short', 'cardio', 'segments', 'were', 'included', 'Section', 'B', 'consisted', 'mainly', 'very', 'basic', 'moves', 'such', 'knee', 'raises', 'side', 'kicks', 'second', 'segment', 'used', 'light', 'weights', 'increase', 'work', 'other', 'hand', 'toning', 'segments', 'section', 'really', 'worked', 'muscles', 'particularly', 'upper', 'body', 'brief', 'stretch', 'Section', 'C', 'upper', 'body', 'toning', 'using', 'weights', 'working', 'shoulders', 'biceps', 'triceps', 'Next', 'first', 'cardio', 'interval', '4', 'minutes', 'then', 'lower', 'body', 'focus', 'plies', 'lunges', 'again', 'using', 'playing', 'cards', 'work', 'using', 'chair', 'balance', 'more', 'upper', 'body', 'push-ups', 'chair', 'Following', 'second', 'cardio', 'interval', '3', 'minutes', 'additional', 'toning', 'work', 'arms', 'using', 'chair', 'tough', 'push-ups', 'segment', 'Kegels', 'inbetween', 'pretty', 'strenuous', 'abs', 'work', 'finally', 'pelvic', 'tilts', 'section', '2-minute', 'stretch.I', 'will', 'definitely', 'continue', 'using', 'Section', 'C', 'when', 'want', 'full-body', 'strength', 'can', 'do', 'relatively', 'short', '40', 'minutes', 'period', 'time', 'think', 'new', 'returning', 'exercise', 'will', 'enjoy', 'gentleness', 'first', 'two', 'sections', 'keep', 'mind', 'might', 'take', 'quite', 'awhile', 'work', 'up', 'third', 'segment', 'definitely', 'video', 'growth', 'can', 'provide', 'benefit', 'most', 'advanced', 'exercisers']",Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension VHS

I bought this because it's Cindy Crawford, and I had her first workout on VHS and remember liking it.This DVD was a very pleasant surprise. It's a calm workout, which I liked - it's like no other workout DVD I own or have used. Even though it's relaxed, if you do workout C, the workout itself is challenging, but because of the music, the visuals changing, and both Kathy and Cindy being relaxed and not annoying, it's a pleasant workout experience.  Who knew that a challenging workout could be effective and relaxing?!Workout A is more like a stretch, with some lunges and squats thrown in. Since this was designed for new moms, I can see why workout A would be appealing - gentle, but it gets you moving.  Workout B is more challenging than workout A, and it's the next step. Workout C is a full-length workout and is definitely the most challenging.Pros:  It features Kathy Kaehler, who has a calm demeanor, and is very likeable. Cindy Crawford is relaxed and likeable, unlike so many of the celebrity workouts.  The music features original artists that are upbeat and calming. The different sets include a high rise with views of a city, an ocean, a house that looks to be on a beach, and a few with Cindy in a bedroom setting, showing that you can do workout A barefoot and in your pajamas.It's like working out with your friends.I'm so glad I didn't read the cover and see that it was for new mothers.",4,Relaxing and Challenging,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,1553,"['When', 'bought', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', 'designed', 'new', 'moms', 'However', 'anyone', 'new', 'working', 'out', 'starting', 'over', 'might', 'like', 'bought', 'Cindy', 'Crawford', 'had', 'first', 'workout', 'VHS', 'remember', 'liking', 'it.This', 'DVD', 'was', 'very', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'calm', 'workout', 'liked', 'other', 'workout', 'DVD', 'own', 'have', 'used', 'Even', 'relaxed', 'do', 'workout', 'C', 'workout', 'challenging', 'music', 'visuals', 'changing', 'Kathy', 'Cindy', 'being', 'relaxed', 'not', 'annoying', 'pleasant', 'workout', 'experience', 'Who', 'knew', 'challenging', 'workout', 'could', 'be', 'effective', 'relaxing', 'more', 'stretch', 'lunges', 'squats', 'thrown', 'was', 'designed', 'new', 'moms', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'appealing', 'gentle', 'moving', 'B', 'more', 'challenging', 'A', 'next', 'step', 'C', 'full-length', 'workout', 'definitely', 'most', 'challenging.Pros', 'Kathy', 'Kaehler', 'who', 'calm', 'demeanor', 'very', 'likeable', 'Cindy', 'Crawford', 'relaxed', 'likeable', 'so', 'many', 'celebrity', 'music', 'original', 'artists', 'are', 'upbeat', 'calming', 'different', 'sets', 'include', 'high', 'rise', 'views', 'city', 'ocean', 'house', 'be', 'beach', 'few', 'Cindy', 'bedroom', 'setting', 'showing', 'can', 'do', 'workout', 'A', 'barefoot', 'pajamas.It', 'working', 'out', 'friends.I', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'cover', 'see', 'was', 'new', 'mothers']",Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension VHS

This is the perfect tape for days when you're feeling a little crampy, or just want to take it a little easier on yourself.

This one is very good about giving you some options to make the moves less hard on the body, too... except those darn deep knee lunges, which are just hard on the knees.  Cindy is really confident on this one, and it is also nice to see her trainer (a more realistic body goal) who is also post-pregnancy & they mention different ways they do certain excercises because of their build, and the differences in their pregnancys.

478109,A2IY49V4ARN4HC,6305786372,K. Parry,"[10, 10]","I purchased this tape before I became pregnant, since I hadn't worked out in a while and needed a program that would allow me to ease back into a routine.  After working out with the tape for a few months, I became pregnant, and I pretty much quit working out until about a month ago (my daughter is seven months old now).This tape addresses many of the issues new moms have: they show you how to do crunches if you have torn abdominal muscles from pregnancy, and Cindy is often pointing out that this is a workout she eased into- in other words, she knows it's a hard workout, and she doesn't want the viewer to feel badly if they can't do all the reps that she can.I now have all of Cindy's tapes, and I use them all on a rotating basis, so I don't get bored.  Although this is the ""easiest"" of the three tapes, don't let that term deceive:  I sweat just as much with this tape as I do with the Next Challenge.One of the things that I really like about Cindy's workouts is that she is not a chipper personality: perky size-two women jumping around on my television proclaiming, ""You can do it!"" doesn't exactly motivate me.  Cindy and Kathy are more of the mindset of getting the job done- after all, most new moms certainly don't have very much time to work out before the baby wakes up again.The tape starts with two short workouts to help get back into an excercising routine.  The movements are slow at times (perhaps a little TOO slow, in my opinion), but they really focus on having the correct form and the lowest risk of injury.  For me, the first two workouts were very easy, and after working out with those for a few days I was ready to move on to the more difficult workout, and I haven't gone back to the short ones since.The third workout is a more intense workout.  Lasting about 40 minutes, it excercises all of the muscle groups, combining primarily strength training with dumbbells and adding a little light aerobics for variety.Something else that really helps put things in perspective when working out is that even Cindy admits she doesn't look the same now as she did before she had her baby; and we shouldn't expect to look the way we did in high school.  Having a supermodel admit that yes, pregnancy DOES have an effect on your overall apperance helps me remember to be happy with the way I look, and to know that although I won't look the same as I did pre-baby, I can be in better shape.",5,"Great for new moms, or those who haven't excercised recently",1015545600,"03 8, 2002",2002,2416,"['purchased', 'tape', 'became', 'pregnant', 'had', ""n't"", 'worked', 'out', 'while', 'needed', 'program', 'would', 'allow', 'ease', 'back', 'routine', 'working', 'out', 'tape', 'few', 'months', 'became', 'pregnant', 'pretty', 'much', 'quit', 'working', 'out', 'month', 'ago', 'daughter', 'seven', 'months', 'old', 'now', '.This', 'tape', 'many', 'issues', 'new', 'moms', 'have', 'show', 'how', 'do', 'crunches', 'have', 'torn', 'abdominal', 'muscles', 'pregnancy', 'Cindy', 'often', 'pointing', 'out', 'workout', 'eased', 'into-', 'other', 'words', 'hard', 'workout', ""n't"", 'want', 'viewer', 'feel', 'badly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'reps', 'can.I', 'now', 'have', 'Cindy', 'tapes', 'use', 'rotating', 'basis', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'easiest', 'three', 'tapes', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'term', 'deceive', 'sweat', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'tape', 'do', 'Next', 'Challenge.One', 'things', 'really', 'Cindy', 'workouts', 'not', 'chipper', 'personality', 'perky', 'size-two', 'women', 'jumping', 'around', 'television', 'proclaiming', 'can', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'motivate', 'Cindy', 'Kathy', 'are', 'more', 'mindset', 'getting', 'job', 'done-', 'most', 'new', 'moms', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'much', 'time', 'work', 'out', 'baby', 'up', 'again.The', 'tape', 'two', 'short', 'workouts', 'help', 'get', 'back', 'excercising', 'routine', 'movements', 'are', 'slow', 'times', 'perhaps', 'little', 'TOO', 'slow', 'opinion', 'really', 'focus', 'having', 'correct', 'form', 'lowest', 'risk', 'injury', 'first', 'two', 'workouts', 'were', 'very', 'easy', 'working', 'out', 'few', 'days', 'was', 'ready', 'move', 'more', 'difficult', 'workout', 'have', ""n't"", 'gone', 'back', 'short', 'ones', 'since.The', 'third', 'workout', 'more', 'intense', 'workout', 'Lasting', '40', 'minutes', 'muscle', 'groups', 'combining', 'primarily', 'strength', 'training', 'dumbbells', 'adding', 'little', 'light', 'aerobics', 'variety.Something', 'else', 'really', 'put', 'things', 'perspective', 'when', 'working', 'out', 'even', 'Cindy', ""n't"", 'look', 'same', 'now', 'did', 'had', 'baby', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'look', 'way', 'did', 'high', 'school', 'Having', 'supermodel', 'admit', 'yes', 'pregnancy', 'DOES', 'have', 'effect', 'overall', 'apperance', 'remember', 'be', 'happy', 'way', 'look', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'look', 'same', 'did', 'pre-baby', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'shape']",Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension VHS

478115,A17TZW64KMZQ3P,6305786372,Nadia555,"[2, 2]","My sister and I completed this entire DVD today. We both agree that Part A on its own is a warm-up, and nothing more. Part B will get your heart rate up, but isn't an adequate workout if you want to see results. Part C is killer. We found a lot of the movements awkward, and off time. At times, it was hard to see what Kathy and Cindy were doing. Nonetheless, by the time I got to Part C, I was drenched in sweat. Overall, I rate this workout highly, because if you do all 3 parts back-to-back, you get an extremely tough, but doable, workout.Notes: - Other than a quick water break, we took no breaks. I believe this is why I got so much out of the workout.- I used 3 pound weights whenever weights were used, and 4 pound weights when Kathy asked for 2 weights in one hand. Previously I have done this workout with 2 lb weights, but 3-4 lbs made it so much tougher, so if you're not getting results, use more weight.",4,"Great, but only if you do Parts A, B and C back-to-back",1381017600,"10 6, 2013",2013,917,"['sister', 'completed', 'entire', 'DVD', 'today', 'agree', 'Part', 'A', 'own', 'warm-up', 'nothing', 'more', 'Part', 'B', 'will', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', ""n't"", 'adequate', 'workout', 'want', 'see', 'results', 'Part', 'C', 'killer', 'found', 'lot', 'movements', 'awkward', 'time', 'times', 'was', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'Kathy', 'Cindy', 'were', 'doing', 'Nonetheless', 'time', 'got', 'Part', 'C', 'was', 'drenched', 'sweat', 'Overall', 'rate', 'workout', 'highly', 'do', '3', 'parts', 'back-to-back', 'get', 'extremely', 'tough', 'doable', 'workout.Notes', 'Other', 'quick', 'water', 'break', 'took', 'breaks', 'believe', 'why', 'got', 'so', 'much', 'workout.-', 'used', '3', 'pound', 'weights', 'whenever', 'weights', 'were', 'used', '4', 'pound', 'weights', 'when', 'Kathy', 'asked', '2', 'weights', 'one', 'hand', 'Previously', 'have', 'done', 'workout', '2', 'lb', 'weights', '3-4', 'lbs', 'made', 'so', 'much', 'tougher', ""'re"", 'not', 'getting', 'results', 'use', 'more', 'weight']",Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension VHS

(I'm referring to workout C, the longest program.) I love the relaxed vibe, the peaceful pretty music and the lovely cinematography. Hardly any talking from either Cindy or her instructor Kathy, another plus. The weights used are light (3-8 lbs), the steps (too simple to be called choreography) are easy to follow and, apart from a few modifiable jumps, it's entirely low impact. All these factors combine to make this the perfect 40-minute no-dread routine for early morning exercise. Ahh, what a terrific mellow way to start the day and get in some stretching, light cardio and general toning.I usually follow up later in the day with either a tougher variety of exercises or additional cardio but if my day becomes too busy and I can't, then at least I've already done something wonderful for my body.",5,"For what it is, it's wonderful",1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,926,"['Not', 'grueling', 'workout', 'means', 'gently', 'effective', 'allover', 'body', 'conditioning', 'routine', 'nearly', 'anyone', 'can', 'do', ""'m"", 'referring', 'workout', 'C', 'longest', 'program', 'love', 'relaxed', 'vibe', 'peaceful', 'pretty', 'music', 'lovely', 'cinematography', 'Hardly', 'talking', 'Cindy', 'instructor', 'Kathy', 'plus', 'weights', 'used', 'are', 'light', '3-8', 'lbs', 'steps', 'too', 'simple', 'be', 'called', 'choreography', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'apart', 'few', 'modifiable', 'jumps', 'entirely', 'low', 'impact', 'factors', 'combine', 'make', 'perfect', '40-minute', 'no-dread', 'routine', 'early', 'morning', 'exercise', 'Ahh', 'what', 'terrific', 'mellow', 'way', 'start', 'day', 'get', 'stretching', 'light', 'cardio', 'general', 'toning.I', 'usually', 'follow', 'up', 'later', 'day', 'tougher', 'variety', 'exercises', 'additional', 'cardio', 'day', 'too', 'busy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'then', 'least', ""'ve"", 'already', 'done', 'something', 'wonderful', 'body']",Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension VHS
