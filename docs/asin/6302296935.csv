For a made-for-TV movie, the special effects are outstanding, made even more incredible considering the lack of CGI at the time.Some scenes and subplots cut from the VHS version and the version farmed out for syndication on local stations have been restored, most notably the assassination subplot (featuring Clarence Gilyard, Jr. and the late Brock Peters) and the original ending (featuring Dan Lauria).The Big One is a better, more realistic disaster thriller than the later 10.5 and 10.5 Apocalypse that NBC most recently broadcast, and has better effects than CBS's more recent earthquake offering, Aftershock: Earthquake in New York, although that movie is pretty good.

Here in the Netherlands I bought the 3 hour miniserie, which is very good.Great SFX and a great suspense-building story, which isn't boring at any moment!I've watched this movie so many times now, and still it touches me. Maybe thats got something to do with me living in a city like Los Angeles. I live in HEERLEN, the Netherlands, a big city also built on a fault. In 1992 we had a damaging 6.2 earthquake here, and since then, 3 or 4 quakes per month between 3-5 on the scale. So like L.A. we're also waiting for the big one here, and that makes this movie even more frightening to me. Because this movie shows what can happen in a convincing way, in other words the SFX are super!Must see movie, but see the 3 hour version, because I can imagine that the movie version isn't that good, like other reviewers said. It's an outrage that this movie is cut! Who has the right to trim a movie?! I always wonder about that, since movie is an art-form. What gives people the right to adjust a piece of art?

After that, I didn't see it again until 1992 and then a lot of the sub-plots had been removed to shorten the running time. For the record, this is the full version - 177 minutes long.It begins in a remote area near Los Angeles City, where a series of small earthquakes are being noticed. An attractive seismologist with the USGS, Dr. Claire Winslow (Joanna Kerns)has just returned from a quake zone in Mexico, and soon finds that the patterns leading to the giant quake in Mexico City are almost identical to those in Los Angeles. When an interview with an unscrupulous reporter, Kevin Conrad (Richard Masur) leads to a hornet's nest of controversy, it touches off a conflict between Claire & her husband, Steve (Dan Lauria), who is trying to land a contract as a landscape architect in a Huntingdon Beach development engineered by developer Wendell Cates (Robert Ginty). The small earthquakes continue, and Cates threatens to get Claire fired through her boss (Richard Herd of 'T.J. Hooker') by putting pressure on the governor through his aide, Chad Spaulding (Joe Spano). In the meantime, the would-be president-elect of South Africa (the late Brock Peters) becomes the target of would-be assassins who want to put the brakes on South African reforms. Amid all this, Claire discovers that the big quake will not come from the San Andreas, but from a smaller fault called the Elysian Park that runs right under the city. It will culminate in a quake of over 8 on the Richter scale, and 20,000 people may perish...The acting is solid in most place, especially Kerns & Lauria who turn in a stellar, believable performance as a family. Ed Begley Jr. & Brock Peters also turn in solid performances, as well as Lindsay Frost & Alan Autry as Claire's sister & her future fiance.While the main focus of the story is the Winslow family & Claire's fight to get her message out, the movie also features multiple subplots including Claire's housekeeper Sonia & her son Miguel, Claire & Laurie's parents Anita & Dr. Owen Parker, and the prominent subplots of developer Cates & his manipulation of Chad Spaulding and Claire's boss, as well as the assassination plot.The visual & special effects make the earthquake itself seem believable & realistic (remember this was before CGI and digital imaging).
