The sounds of the waves combined with the music drown out what seem like pretty good pointers, from the little I can catch of them!  Otherwise, it's a thorough workout, 45 minutes including a warmup and cooldown, she alternates muscle groups so you minimise resting time, goes slow so you can increase your weights, and even includes an exercise for the oft neglected but most important cuff rotators, plus spinal erectors.  Oh - and you don't need a bench at all, a sturdy chair will do you for the sitting movements, and the lying ones like chest work can be done on a mat - actually, it's better, less chance of lowering your arms below your chest level.Anyhow - I would have recommended this for all levels, as she goes slow enough for beginners to learn good form - HOWEVER since you can't hear her properly, I only recommend this for people like myself who have worked out with weights and feel confident about their form!  Quite honestly, I would like to return this video - it's just too much hassle from Malta!",3,terrible sound,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,1099,"['Good', 'allover', 'workout', 'sound', 'am', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'problem', 'sounds', 'waves', 'combined', 'music', 'out', 'what', 'seem', 'pretty', 'good', 'pointers', 'little', 'can', 'catch', 'Otherwise', 'thorough', 'workout', '45', 'minutes', 'including', 'warmup', 'cooldown', 'muscle', 'groups', 'so', 'minimise', 'resting', 'time', 'slow', 'can', 'increase', 'weights', 'even', 'exercise', 'oft', 'neglected', 'most', 'important', 'cuff', 'rotators', 'spinal', 'erectors', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'bench', 'sturdy', 'chair', 'will', 'do', 'sitting', 'movements', 'lying', 'ones', 'chest', 'work', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'mat', 'actually', 'better', 'less', 'chance', 'lowering', 'arms', 'chest', 'level.Anyhow', 'would', 'have', 'recommended', 'levels', 'slow', 'enough', 'beginners', 'learn', 'good', 'form', 'HOWEVER', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'properly', 'only', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'weights', 'feel', 'confident', 'form', 'Quite', 'honestly', 'would', 'like', 'return', 'video', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'hassle', 'Malta']",N/A

Eventually, it wore out and I apparently got rid of it a few years ago.  I just ordered another new copy today.  I own some of the best DVDs - Janis Saffell, Ellen Barrett, Minna Lessig, but this is a great video to return to, I feel Denise Austin's best ever.  I'm not overweight or out of shape, but when I did this video 4x/week for two months getting ready for a vacation some years ago, I dropped several inches, which results I have not seen since.  Denise is not overly annoying in this video and can keep count (which I find a problem with the Personal Trainer DVD).

Unfortunately, now I'm older and the chiropractors said lay off the strength training with free weights, so now I have to use a non-impact type of strength training, but for you younger, more fit folks, this covers all of them and you'll build some awesome muscles!

77847,ATKVDKXO3Q6ZM,0784017859,Teedums,"[5, 5]","I was pleasantly surprised by this video, I happened to rent Denise's Sizzler workout from the library which contained snippets of Totally Firm, based on that I decided to order it. I am glad that I did. I haven't seen much of Denise's videos as I use mainly the Firm and others but was impressed by this one. It is a solid 45 minute weight training routine, Denise hits all the muscle groups at least once and even includes calf and rotator cuff work. You work your legs with squats, static lunges and plie squats, plus calf lifts and leg lifts while sitting on the bench. For arms you will see bicep curls, overhead presses for shoulders, triceps kickbacks and tricep dips using a bench, front and side shoulder raises, bench press, pec flies and pushups for chest and some ab work. Denise uses a 2-2 count for all the exercises, she uses 5lb weights. I used anywhere from 5-12lb weights, the controlled pace of the reps allows for you to lift heavy if you choose to. The only negative is the counts are uneven for the exercises, some exercises there are 12-13 reps, others are 16-18 reps. It would have been nice if they were all 12 reps or 16 reps. But that was a minor irritation in an otherwise good workout. This is a workout that you can grow with too, which is a plus.Denise has 2 people exercising with her, Jeff and Kelly who is a personal trainer with great form. The setting is on a beach in Mexico overlooking the ocean, very pretty. You can also hear the ocean waves crashing which I thought was neat, the music is nothing spectacular but not bad either. I felt that it suited the workout well. Denise offers a lot of good pointers in this workout, and she looks great as well. She is still her perky self with her funny comments, but not over the top at all. I thought she did a great job.If you are looking to add one Denise video to your collection, this is it. A lot of reviews I have read state this is the best one she has come out with, I would agree with that 100%.",4,Great workout from Denise....,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,1988,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'video', 'happened', 'rent', 'Denise', 'Sizzler', 'workout', 'library', 'contained', 'snippets', 'Totally', 'Firm', 'based', 'decided', 'order', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'Denise', 'videos', 'use', 'mainly', 'Firm', 'others', 'was', 'impressed', 'one', 'solid', '45', 'minute', 'weight', 'training', 'routine', 'Denise', 'muscle', 'groups', 'least', 'once', 'even', 'calf', 'rotator', 'cuff', 'work', 'work', 'legs', 'squats', 'static', 'lunges', 'plie', 'squats', 'calf', 'lifts', 'leg', 'lifts', 'sitting', 'bench', 'arms', 'will', 'see', 'bicep', 'curls', 'overhead', 'presses', 'shoulders', 'triceps', 'kickbacks', 'tricep', 'dips', 'using', 'bench', 'front', 'side', 'shoulder', 'raises', 'bench', 'press', 'pec', 'flies', 'pushups', 'chest', 'ab', 'work', 'Denise', '2-2', 'count', 'exercises', '5lb', 'weights', 'used', 'anywhere', '5-12lb', 'weights', 'controlled', 'pace', 'reps', 'lift', 'heavy', 'choose', 'only', 'negative', 'counts', 'are', 'uneven', 'exercises', 'exercises', 'are', '12-13', 'reps', 'others', 'are', '16-18', 'reps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'were', '12', 'reps', '16', 'reps', 'was', 'minor', 'irritation', 'otherwise', 'good', 'workout', 'workout', 'can', 'grow', 'too', 'plus.Denise', '2', 'people', 'exercising', 'Jeff', 'Kelly', 'who', 'personal', 'trainer', 'great', 'form', 'setting', 'beach', 'Mexico', 'overlooking', 'ocean', 'very', 'pretty', 'can', 'also', 'hear', 'ocean', 'waves', 'crashing', 'thought', 'was', 'neat', 'music', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'not', 'bad', 'either', 'felt', 'suited', 'workout', 'well', 'Denise', 'lot', 'good', 'pointers', 'workout', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'still', 'perky', 'self', 'funny', 'comments', 'not', 'top', 'thought', 'did', 'great', 'job.If', 'are', 'looking', 'add', 'one', 'Denise', 'video', 'collection', 'lot', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'state', 'best', 'one', 'come', 'out', 'would', 'agree', '100', '%']",N/A
