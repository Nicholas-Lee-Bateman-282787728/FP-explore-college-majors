Jamie manages to ingratiate himself with the group's leader Emily (Joely Richardson) and finds that he is in the midst of a free-love and free-thinking group of individuals. Each has a very different mindset (especially wild-child, Lizzie, played by Anna Friel), but they manage to only convey a retread, hippie lifestyle to the viewer.I initially watched this only because of Jeremy Northam and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, but was completely drained by the time I reached the ending. It is pretentious beyond belief, but if the viewer is into art for the sake of art, it's worth at least one viewing. 2 stars.",2,Art for the Sake of Art..,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,846,"['Tribe', 'one', 'films', 'viewer', 'watches', 'thinks', 'Hmm', 'just', 'too', 'artsy', 'London-based', 'cult/sect/council', 'encroaching', 'potential', 'real-estate', 'goldmine', 'local', 'businessman', 'Jamie', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Jamie', 'ingratiate', 'group', 'leader', 'Emily', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'midst', 'free-love', 'free-thinking', 'group', 'individuals', 'very', 'different', 'mindset', 'especially', 'wild-child', 'Lizzie', 'played', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'manage', 'only', 'convey', 'retread', 'hippie', 'lifestyle', 'viewer.I', 'initially', 'watched', 'only', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'was', 'completely', 'drained', 'time', 'reached', 'ending', 'pretentious', 'belief', 'viewer', 'art', 'sake', 'art', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'viewing', '2', 'stars']",N/A

992883,A26WVK274IA7DN,B000FO0AD8,Sarah Bellum,"[28, 29]","Jamie (Jeremy Northam) is charged by the head of his firm with removing a mysterious group from some property he wants to develop. This `tribe' is a sort of cult, which barricades itself inside a gated mansion in a seedy part of London. Local, would-be hooligans are afraid of this group for no particular reason, especially considering the group is comprised of feeble, malnourished models. To earn a living, the Tribe sells electronic gadgetry on the street. How they obtain the gadgetry in the first place is a bit of a secret, though the group suspects it involves an exchange for sex between a desperate Japanese businessman and their leader, Emily (Joely Richardson). All of this is peripheral to the real crux of the group, which is free love. Jamie penetrates the group (quite literally) in the name of procuring the land that houses the group's fortress, though he finds himself increasingly both enamored of the Tribe's charm and disillusioned by his career ambitions. Made for the Beeb, there are certainly some silly moments, such as several scenes of the group strutting down the street or over meadows in their black robes, or barging into the compound of a competing sect and trying to form an alliance. Nonetheless, this film certainly provides enough mystery and allure to hold one's interest for most of its runtime. I initially wanted to watch it for Kate Isitt (of `Coupling' fame), though her role is very, very small. Not to fret, Northam and Richardson prove to be charming attractions. Anna Friel, however, practically steals the show as the wayward and free-spirited (read: loose) Lizzie. Fans of Jonathan Rhys Meyers probably will not be disappointed to find him fully nude in a couple scenes as well. There is also a series of this show, though I am not familiar with it. The DVD is presented in widescreen and the transfer looks great, though it lacks in all other departments; no subtitles or extras of any sort. This is not rated by the MPAA since it was made for TV, though it is the equivalent of an `R' rating due to full frontal nudity, profanity and a wee bit of violence.",3,The Tribe is mysterious and absurd,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,2107,"['Jamie', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'charged', 'head', 'firm', 'removing', 'mysterious', 'group', 'property', 'develop', 'tribe', 'sort', 'cult', 'gated', 'mansion', 'seedy', 'part', 'London', 'Local', 'would-be', 'hooligans', 'are', 'afraid', 'group', 'particular', 'reason', 'especially', 'considering', 'group', 'comprised', 'feeble', 'malnourished', 'models', 'earn', 'living', 'Tribe', 'electronic', 'gadgetry', 'street', 'How', 'obtain', 'gadgetry', 'first', 'place', 'bit', 'secret', 'group', 'exchange', 'sex', 'desperate', 'Japanese', 'businessman', 'leader', 'Emily', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'peripheral', 'real', 'crux', 'group', 'free', 'love', 'Jamie', 'group', 'quite', 'literally', 'name', 'procuring', 'land', 'houses', 'group', 'fortress', 'increasingly', 'enamored', 'Tribe', 'charm', 'disillusioned', 'career', 'ambitions', 'Made', 'Beeb', 'are', 'certainly', 'silly', 'moments', 'such', 'several', 'scenes', 'group', 'strutting', 'down', 'street', 'meadows', 'black', 'robes', 'barging', 'compound', 'competing', 'sect', 'trying', 'form', 'alliance', 'Nonetheless', 'film', 'certainly', 'enough', 'mystery', 'allure', 'hold', 'one', 'interest', 'most', 'runtime', 'initially', 'wanted', 'watch', 'Kate', 'Isitt', 'Coupling', 'fame', 'role', 'very', 'very', 'small', 'Not', 'fret', 'Northam', 'Richardson', 'prove', 'be', 'charming', 'attractions', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'however', 'practically', 'show', 'wayward', 'free-spirited', 'read', 'loose', 'Lizzie', 'Fans', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'find', 'fully', 'nude', 'couple', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'series', 'show', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'DVD', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'great', 'other', 'departments', 'subtitles', 'extras', 'sort', 'not', 'rated', 'MPAA', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'equivalent', 'R', 'rating', 'due', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'profanity', 'wee', 'bit', 'violence']",N/A
