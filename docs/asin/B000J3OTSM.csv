The acting, plot and character development was all sorely lacking, to the point where the motivation for character's actions were at many times missing. An example of the poor character development, is that we are shown how these boys kill time in their underprivileged situation by getting involved with illegal activities, but we are not shown why and how they got involved (eg at least try and show they are trying to fill something they feel is missing in their life) - but all we see is them acting and being stupid. so we don't feel any sympathy or empathy for the main male characters. Also lots of cheesy and corny lines, doesn't help the script either. and unfortunately even the strongest area of the film - the dancing - was only OK, as it really lacked the WOW factor one should expect in this day.",3,"Not bad, but not good.",1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,927,"['Whith', 'not', 'expecting', 'film', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'served', 'acting', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'point', 'where', 'motivation', 'character', 'actions', 'were', 'many', 'times', 'missing', 'example', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'shown', 'how', 'boys', 'kill', 'time', 'underprivileged', 'situation', 'getting', 'involved', 'illegal', 'activities', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'why', 'how', 'got', 'involved', 'eg', 'least', 'try', 'show', 'are', 'trying', 'fill', 'something', 'feel', 'missing', 'life', 'see', 'acting', 'being', 'stupid', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sympathy', 'empathy', 'main', 'male', 'characters', 'Also', 'lots', 'cheesy', 'corny', 'lines', ""n't"", 'help', 'script', 'unfortunately', 'even', 'strongest', 'area', 'film', 'dancing', 'was', 'only', 'OK', 'really', 'lacked', 'WOW', 'factor', 'one', 'should', 'expect', 'day']",N/A
1024640,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B000J3OTSM,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[108, 115]","This is one of the most delightful films we have seen in a long time. The story is warm, and meaningful, with excellent character development, plot, acting, dancing, and music. And it teaches morals and ethics, to boot.Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) is a down and out, teenage foster kid, stuck in a family with a harried foster mom, struggling to support the family; a beer guzzling, TV-addicted, couch potato ""dad"" and two younger foster siblings, just as lost as he is. He hangs in his run down Baltimore neighborhood with  Mac Carter (Damaine Radcliff) and his little brother Skinny (De'Shawn Washington), whose mother works at night, which is when the boys routinely get into trouble.Tyler and Mac regularly jack cars and sell them at the local chop shop. On Saturday nights, they drop in at a neighborhood night club, populated by the occasional gunslinger, but with the best break dancing anywhere. And Tyler is a natural.One weekend night, after being threatened with a gun and fleeing the club, Tyler, Mac and Skinny run through the streets, kicking cans and carelessly tossing refuse. Then one of them accidentally hits the window at the Maryland School of the Arts. Skinny decides to smash the window completely, and before long, the boys are in. They ogle the halls and showcases until Tyler finds the auditorium and heads for the stage, awed by the costumes, sets and props, which which the boys are soon dancing--and smashing.Tyler takes the rap for his friends, who flee into the night. Sentenced to 200 hours of community service, he at first wants nothing more than to finish his time, mopping floors, changing lights and collecting trash.But while making repairs on a ladder one afternoon, he witnesses a series of inept male dancers trying out as the partner for Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan). They trip, they fall, they drop her. They stink. She goes through them all, and then wonders what to do. She needs a stand in until her regular partner recovers from his sprained ankle. Tyler offers to catch her. She hesitates, but when he convinces her that he's serious, she is surprised to see that he not only can catch her--but do it gracefully.An appeal to school director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths) wins her hesitant support for Tyler to temporarily take the role. Over the next few weeks, he helps her to rework the piece, jazzing it up, and adding several more dancers he has recruited from around the school. He also convinces her to let her talented friend Miles Darby (Mario), revise the music, after Nora's erstwhile boyfriend Brett Dolan (Josh Henderson) drops Miles from his group to sign a New York recording contract.There is some really original music here, some great dancing, and a wonderful plot, emphasizing the importance of friendships. It's a heartwarming story of success in the face of adversity, and tragedy. A great family film that teens especially will love.--Alyssa A.

1024648,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000J3OTSM,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I will say that there is nothing new in `Step Up', like at all.  The film is a product of its environment and it really is the `same ol same' when it comes to teen romance dramas.  There is the whole shtick (boy meets girl, they are SOOO different and yet they click, they learn, they fight, they get back together) and the premise to the film seems borrowed heavily from elsewhere.  What sets `Step Up' apart and allows the audience to enjoy it with reckless abandon is the sheer charisma of the films stars and the way they feed off one another flawlessly.  Yes, the `Step Up' series is far from perfect (the second installment is decent enough, but the retched 3rd act is an abomination) but this first installment is a lot of fun.  For what it presents, it's kind of perfect.  Channing Tatum is on top of his game, although I will say that after initially seeing this film I really expected his career to be, um, different.

A troubled teenager who lives in a foster home gets himself in trouble (yet again!) but this time meets a gorgeous girl, falls in love, and also finds the meaning of life.  I must also mention that the script and the direction of the movie was not so impressive, either.  So, artistically, two stars would be a very generous rating for this movie.  However, this is a movie about dancing.  And to rate the movie's depiction of dancers 'dancing' I give it five stars.  I would also give the casting director credit for casting the two main characters of this movie, Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan.  Their vibrant and sexy nature completely draws us, the audience, into the screen and makes it a little more bearable for us to watch the weak plotline unfold.  And then when they dance, it is simply amazing.  The dancing, on its own, makes the movie worthwhile to watch.  Unlike other movies about dancing, these actors both come from a dancing background and you can clearly see that in their performances in the movie.

The biggest asset the dancing and choreography has in this film is that it is completely REAL! There's none of that, shoot the lead actors in close up and insert the real dancer in long shots.The leads, Channing Tatum & Jenna Dewan are AMAZING dancers for actors. It is very rare to find ACTORS in hollywood that also DANCE this good and the creators of STEP UP were intelligent enough and professional enough to use no smoke and mirrors in the movie. They dance and we see them dance. In fact, there are many instances in the movie that are jaw dropping. Most noteably, a scene with Tatum on a car. Then the final scene will give chills to true dance fans.Unfortunately though, STEP UP is far less creative when it comes to storyline, originality and believablitity. Unfortunately, it is ONLY the dancing that will garnish much emotion from its viewers.Many of the dilemmas were too easily solved with coincidences and rushed plotting. Many of the shocking instances were way too foreshadowed, obvious and unshocking. Many of the instances that moved the story along were sort of, for lack of better words, silly.I don't want to give too many examples because I don't want to ruin for those who haven't seen, but I'll try to be vague. Like, the car scene for instance. As cool of a dance scene as it was, you can't help but think, ""What the heck is this dork doing?"" Cause that is what you would be thinking if you saw this clown doing this elaborate dance in a parking lot in broad daylight, for no reason. The death scene... I saw it coming fifteen minutes before it happened. Terrible execution. Also, Tatum's free-style dance character adapted to the choreographed moves too easily.The storyline to STEP UP is very run of the mill, you've seen it before, and you've seen it again. Bad boy meets good girl, learns something good, changes for the good, they have a falling out and they get back together just in time to reach their goal. This to me is STEP UP's biggest flaw, but what makes it even worse is that the reason for their falling out, or at least the length of their falling out, is very weak and doesn't really inspire much emotion other than... ""Oh, I bet they get back together seconds before the final dance.""I recommend STEP UP, but only for the amazing dance sequences, choreography, realism and originality. It's just unfortunate that they couldn't come up with a storyline that was original or storyline execution that was more believeable and anticlimatic.",4,Void of ORIGINALITY... but amazing DANCING,1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,2678,"['could', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'most', 'memorable', 'dance', 'movies', 'ever', 'were', ""n't"", 'weak', 'unoriginal', 'storyline.First', 'dancing', 'STEP', 'UP', 'fantastic', 'even', 'breathtaking', 'times', 'biggest', 'asset', 'dancing', 'choreography', 'film', 'completely', 'REAL', 'none', 'shoot', 'lead', 'actors', 'close', 'insert', 'real', 'dancer', 'long', 'shots.The', 'leads', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Jenna', 'Dewan', 'are', 'AMAZING', 'dancers', 'actors', 'very', 'rare', 'find', 'ACTORS', 'hollywood', 'also', 'DANCE', 'good', 'creators', 'STEP', 'UP', 'were', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'professional', 'enough', 'use', 'smoke', 'mirrors', 'movie', 'dance', 'see', 'dance', 'fact', 'are', 'many', 'instances', 'movie', 'are', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'Most', 'noteably', 'scene', 'Tatum', 'car', 'Then', 'final', 'scene', 'will', 'give', 'chills', 'true', 'dance', 'fans.Unfortunately', 'STEP', 'UP', 'far', 'less', 'creative', 'when', 'storyline', 'originality', 'believablitity', 'Unfortunately', 'ONLY', 'dancing', 'will', 'garnish', 'much', 'emotion', 'viewers.Many', 'dilemmas', 'were', 'too', 'easily', 'solved', 'coincidences', 'rushed', 'plotting', 'Many', 'shocking', 'instances', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'foreshadowed', 'obvious', 'unshocking', 'Many', 'instances', 'moved', 'story', 'were', 'sort', 'lack', 'better', 'words', 'silly.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'many', 'examples', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'ll"", 'try', 'be', 'vague', 'car', 'scene', 'instance', 'cool', 'dance', 'scene', 'was', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'What', 'heck', 'dork', 'doing', 'Cause', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'thinking', 'saw', 'clown', 'doing', 'elaborate', 'dance', 'parking', 'lot', 'broad', 'daylight', 'reason', 'death', 'scene', 'saw', 'coming', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'happened', 'Terrible', 'execution', 'Also', 'Tatum', 'free-style', 'dance', 'character', 'adapted', 'choreographed', 'moves', 'too', 'easily.The', 'storyline', 'STEP', 'UP', 'very', 'run', 'mill', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'again', 'Bad', 'boy', 'meets', 'good', 'girl', 'something', 'good', 'changes', 'good', 'have', 'falling', 'out', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'just', 'time', 'reach', 'goal', 'STEP', 'UP', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'what', 'even', 'worse', 'reason', 'falling', 'out', 'least', 'length', 'falling', 'out', 'very', 'weak', ""n't"", 'really', 'inspire', 'much', 'emotion', 'other', 'Oh', 'bet', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'final', 'dance', 'recommend', 'STEP', 'UP', 'only', 'amazing', 'dance', 'sequences', 'choreography', 'realism', 'originality', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'storyline', 'was', 'original', 'storyline', 'execution', 'was', 'more', 'believeable', 'anticlimatic']",N/A

All the boys at that school were wimpy little things, weren't they? Could any of them hold up a partner in a pas de deux? Also, I couldn't tell how much time went by after Tyler quit and then asked to be taken back, but it had to be weeks.

1024667,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000J3OTSM,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[1, 1]","...I liked this movie.  Although it follows the same formula as almost every other teen movie (opposites attract, they learn from each other, they fight, they learn lessons, they fall in love) it still offers something fresh with the chemistry between its characters.  I still don't understand why they can't make a movie about two poor kids or two spoiled rich kids...I mean at least they didn't go the obvious route and make this a bi-racial thing (ala `Save the Last Dance', which I love but needed need repeating).So, despite offering nothing new `Step Up' still delivers entertainment that is worth the time.  So we have tough-guy foster-kid Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum, a boy with a future) who rebels with his friend Mac (Damaine Radcliff) by stealing cars and breaking and entering.  His latest stunt though (trashing the auditorium of a local performing arts school) got him caught and sentenced to 200 hours of community service within the school walls.  That's where he meets aspiring dancer Nora (Jenna Dewan) who just lost her dance partner and is desperate for help with her senior showcase.  That's where Tyler comes in for little does she know, he can really dance.Expect the usual boy likes girl, girl doesn't trust boy but is drawn to the danger he presents.  She's tempted to fall for him while still having a boyfriend, yet boyfriend is creep.  She also must contend with a mother who doesn't support her dream and continues to push her own aspirations on her daughter.  Boy must learn life lessons about change and sacrifice, and this may or may not manifest itself in the form of Skinny (De'Shawn Washington), Mac's younger brother, who gets himself in trouble after trying to hard to be like his older brother and his best friend (I saw that one coming from the very beginning).There are some good performances by the two leads as well as Drew Sidora who plays Nora's best friend Lucy as well as singer Mario (who looks like a younger Chris Rock) who plays Miles, the school musician who secretly loves Lucy.  I liked it, and I'm sure the general public will too.  It has enough charm and chemistry to make it memorable, I just wish they would invest some extra time and effort to make a movie that's different and unique, not something rewashed and regurgitated.

1024669,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000J3OTSM,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","Its foundation may be shaped by a number of clich&eacute;s, but Step Up manages to rise above all of its individual parts and surpass expectations.  I'm not really a fan of the whole dance movie genre, but I really enjoyed this movie.  That being said, I would never have watched it had Jenna Dewan, the absolutely hottest female on the planet, not been in it.  Apparently, Channing Tatum represents some kind of eye candy for the female audience, as well - but all I know is that Jenna Dewan is a veritable goddess.Let's list some of those clich&eacute;s peppering this story: you've got your hip-hop hoodlum heading down the wrong path in life who gets an unexpected chance to do something worthwhile; your pretty, rich girl who takes a desperate chance with a guy from the other side of the tracks; their early friction but inevitable romance; and it's served up with a noticeable dash of a future gangster learning his lesson the hard way.  It all works out in a predictably cheesy conclusion, of course, but this film is too good to let cheesy endings and predictable storylines bring it down.  For some reason, everything about Step Up just works like a charm.Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) is a wayward youth seemingly content to grow up as a real loser, spending most of his time hanging out with his equally carefree friends, jacking cars, and basically just being a juvenile delinquent.  After he's busted for trashing the auditorium at the Maryland School of Dance, though, he's sentenced to two hundred hours of community service there at the school.  His devil-may-care attitude doesn't win him any friends initially, but one talented young dancer, Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan) does take notice of the dancing skills she sees him displaying for his hoodlum friends.  After her dancing partner injures his foot and she can't find a suitable replacement, she reluctantly agrees to give Tyler a shot.  She's desperate because the big Fall Senior Showcase is coming up, and that represents her big chance of actually making it as a dancer after she graduates.  Obviously, it's not a smooth road ahead - getting Tyler to mimic her more formal moves, getting Tyler to show up to practice on time, etc.  Somewhere along the way, though, Tyler begins to have a new perspective on life and - for the first time ever - begins to dream of a better future.  His friends resent him for what he is doing, but that proves to be the least of his troubles.Step Up has a little bit of everything - it's way more than a mere excuse to watch some good dancing.  Most importantly, it starts with a story we've seen and heard before in numerous forms and takes it to new heights.  And every strand of that story ultimately culminates beautifully in the Senior Showcase.  Channing Tatum isn't going to win any awards for his brooding, uninspired acting, but that takes nothing away from the story.  For her part, Jenna Dewan is fantastic in every way.Finally, I just want to say that parents of young teenagers should have no qualms about letting their kids watch this movie.  I think the PG-13 rating hinges for the most part on a tragic event that takes place late in the film.  There is mild profanity, but there is no nudity whatsoever.  The only danger would be for pre-adolescent boys, as the mere sight of Jenna Dewan is more than capable of causing the immediate onset of puberty.

1024674,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000J3OTSM,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","Anne Fletcher appeared as a dancer on films such as ""The Flinstones"", ""The Mask"" and ""Tank Girl"" but she also developed the choreography for ""Boogie Nights"" and ""A Life Less Ordinary"".Although best known as a choreographer, in 2006, Fletcher received the opportunity to direct her first film.  That film would be ""Step Up"" (2006), a $12 million dance/romance film starring unknown talent at the time, Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan.Suffice to say, ""Step Up"" was an amazing success despite critics panning it.  ""Step Up"" earned over $119 million in the box office and since the release of the movie, there are now a total of four ""Step Up"" films, Anne Fletcher has gone to direct films such as ""27 Dresses"" and ""The Proposal"", Channing Tatum became a big movie star (""Public Enemies"", ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"", ""21 Jump Street"", ""The Vow"", ""Magic Mike"") and Jenna Dewan (""The Playboy Club"", ""Melrose Place"", ""The Grudge 2&#8243;) would go on to marry her co-star and is now known as Jenna Dewan-Tatum.The film would star R&B; singer Mario (""Freedom Writers""), a a young Alyson Stoner (""Camp Rock"" films, ""Step Up 3D"", ""Cheaper by the Dozen"", voice actress for ""Phineas and Ferb""),  Rachel Griffiths (""Blow"", ""Brothers & Sisters"", ""Six Feet Under""), Drew Sidora (""Wild Hogs"", ""Never Die Alone"", ""White Chicks""), Damaine Radcliff (""Glory Road"", who does the visual effects now for ""Supah Ninjas""), De'Shawn Washington and the late Heavy D.VIDEO:""Step Up"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  Having watched this film several times, especially for the dance choreography, I can easily say that the film looks absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray.  From the cinematography of the talented Michael Seresin (""Harry Potter and the Prison of Azkaban"", ""Midnight Express"", ""The Life of David Gale"", ""Sleeping Dogs""), Seresin is known for capturing action and despair.  For this film, he manages to capture inner-street culture, beautiful scenery as both Tyler and Nora are above a building top overlooking the harbor but most importantly capturing dance choreography and making things look smooth.The video quality for this 2006 film looks good especially during the dance scenes which utilize a lot of different lights and coloring.  If anything, Seresin uses lighting effectively throughout the film.  Skin tones look natural, I was expecting to possibly see banding during the more intensive red lighting but everything looked great. Black levels were nice and deep and I detected no banding, DNR or artifacting during my viewing of the entire film.The clarity of the Blu-ray release over the original DVD release is quite noticeable and fans of the film should be happy with this Blu-ray release.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Step Up"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  First and foremost, ""Step Up"" is a film that is primarily dialogue and music-driven.  While there are some scenes such as broken glass or even a gun shot, dialogue is crystal clear as with the music which utilizes bass, cool beats and also scenes with crowd ambiance (especially during the final sequence).  The lossless soundtrack is quite appropriate for this film and fans who enjoyed the film before, will enjoy the clarity of the music on Blu-ray!Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Step Up"" comes with the following special features:Deleted Scenes - A total of seven deleted scenes including an optional deleted scenes commentary track by director Anne Fletcher.Bloopers - (1:36) Outtakes from ""Step Up"".Making the Movie - (4:39) Director Ann Fletcher talks about being a choreographer and working with a talented team including the choreographers who helped prepapre the talent for the film.  Interviews with cast and Benny the choreographer.Music Videos - Featuring the following music videos ""Step Up"" by Samantha Jade, ""(When You Gonna) Give It Up to Me"" by Sean Paul feat. Keyshia Cole, ""Say Goodbye"" by Chris Brown and ""Get Up"" Ciara feat. Chamillionaire.JUDGMENT CALL:Having watched the ""Step Up"" films evolve since the original, I felt that the films have become more of an emphasis on choreography than story.  Which is not a bad thing if you tend to watch dance films wanting to see more choreography, but ""Step Up"" is one of those films that you look back and say to yourself, ""Channing Tatum was pretty awesome in that movie"".Sure, we are so used to seeing Channing Tatum as action hero or romantic lead but ""Step Up"" was an earlier work that did show some potential for the actor.  To tell you the truth, he seemed so natural as a dancer and you just don't see that happening with a lot of movie stars, who typically train for the role and have a body double.But not for this film.This is where Anne Fletcher's strength as a choreographer is effective.  She knows how fake dance films can be when the actual talents are not being used and in this case, she made sure that the cast was well-selected and most importantly, she envisioned how the choreography would be and have her staff prepare for the talent for those scenes.  Both Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan look natural, feel natural and it made the film work.  I actually liked the blending of ballet and hip-hop choreography.But with that being said about the choreography, what about the film and the acting?Haven't we been there before with the 2001 film ""Save the Last Dance"".  Ballerina hooks up with a tough guy from the wrong side of the city.  Granted, Channing Tatum is not Black but there is a banality of films about rich girl, poor guy/bad boy hooking up.Also, I've described Channing Tatum's acting as stiff, not recently but more of his past films.  But I will say unlike ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"", Tatum is more in his element it seems for ""Step Up"" and by no means is his dancing stiff.  The guy can pop, dance and still shows a little bit of that when I was reviewing the Blu-ray of ""21 Jump Street"" earlier in the week.The thing is, he has grown as an actor since this film but the character role of Tyler, a troubled teen from a troubled home, Tatum made it work!Aside from banality, there are some issues of pacing and for more serious viewers, some may feel the subplot involving Miles Darby (as portrayed by Mario) and Lucy Avila (as portrayed by Drew Sidora) as unnecessary.  In a way, it was because these characters were not fleshed out all that well.  They are more diversions, where at least Miles contributes to the music, Lucy Avila is more of the friend who keeps egging her friend Nora to go for Tyler.  But when it comes to their friendship, the storyline falls apart and feels forced as if the film needed to increase the time of duration.  In fact, there is a storyline that involves Nora's boyfriend/ex-boyfriend Brett Dolan (as portrayed by Josh Henderson) and it seems as if he could be an intriguing rival to Tyler but his character disappears by the second half of the film.If anything, I wish more was explored into the life of Tyler Gage at home or even with his friends, otherwise this film really needed fine tuning with its supporting characters.But despite a few of the problems that the film had, I did enjoy it.  And it did make a tremendous amount of money and definitely set made things brighter for both Channing Tatum and director Anne Fletcher and many more ""Step Up"" films to come.As for the Blu-ray release, for those who own the previous DVD, the special features are the same but the difference is better clarity on video and better sound quality thanks to the lossless soundtrack.  And if you love the film, the upgrade is definitely worth it.Overall,  ""Step Up"" may not be an original or even a great dance film, but I still enjoyed the dance choreography and the bad boy meets rich girl storyline.  Back when this film came out, I had low expectations.  But after watching it, I realized that ""Step Up"" is one of the better dancing films out there.  And since the release of this film, compared to the other ""Step Up"" films that have been released, ""Step Up"" still has the better storyline.If you are a fan of the film or love dancing films, ""Step Up"" is definitely worth owning on Blu-ray!",4,"If you are a fan of the film or love dancing films, ""Step Up"" is definitely worth owning on Blu-ray!",1354147200,"11 29,

1024687,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000J3OTSM,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","In STEP UP, cultures clash and the musical worlds of ballet and hip hop amicably collide. When troubled, young carjacker Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) and his homies break into and trash the Maryland School of the Arts, Tyler is nabbed and is penalized with 200 hours of community service at that same institute. There, toiling away as a custodian, he catches a glimpse of ballet dancer Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan) as she beguilingly works thru a floor routine. Tyler is accordingly intrigued with her grace and beauty. A little later, Nora looks out a window and witnesses Tyler outside goofing around with some nifty hip hop moves. Hmmm....curiousity is piqued.The school's senior showcase presents an all-important plot device as it is key in Nora garnering a lucrative post-graduate livelihood as potential dance company employers will be present for her performance. Too, she's promised her unsupportive mom that if her showcase proves unsuccessful (ie, she doesn't land a gig) she'll settle for a more practical vocation. Calamity strikes when Nora's dance partner suffers an injury and bows out of the showcase and Nora's ensuing search for a new partner proves frustratingly futile (apparently, a lot of these male dancers are puny wusses who can't hoist up a girl without embarassingly collapsing in a wimpy heap). Tyler, fueled by his attraction for the girl, steps up and is able to successfully pass Nora's lift try-out. Nora gives him a shot, despite misgivings from her and the skeptical school director. However, their doubts soon bear fruition as Tyler initially doesn't take Nora's classical dancing seriously, is tardy for practice, and even quits for a time. But, finally, something clicks in Tyler's brain as he at last finds his rudder and zeroes in on what he wants - the chance to pursue his new-found dream and, of course, the girl...STEP UP is energized by the two vibrant leads, Tatum and Dewan. Gee, it's nice to be young and hot and in tune with your body. Jenna Dewan is beautiful and shows off her acting chops, while Channing Tatum's acting is choppy but, at least, he is, to quote the girls, ""babe-a-licious"" - he's certainly got that laid back, smoldering thing going on (I'm trying not to hate). Plus and importantly, these two can dance it up, with Tatum a particular stand-out as the white-boy dancer from the slums who can bust a move. Tatum and Dewan breaking it down and funking it up in the club and, later, on stage are showstoppers. The movie also benefits from the secondary pair of dj Mario (Miles Darby) and his crush, the seemingly unattainable Lucy (Drew Avila), both of whom provide amiable support for our stars. Damaine Radcliffe also turns in a solid performance as Mac, Tyler's lifelong best friend, who feels his friendship with Tyler slipping away as Tyler becomes more embroiled in the doings at the Maryland school. Mac's younger brother Skinny (De'Shawn Washington), however, is plain annoying in his lame attempts to win his bro's well regard. Plus, you see his story arc coming from a mile away.Somewhat reminiscent of FAME but not quite in the same vein as the more urban YOU GOT SERVED, STEP UP is great fun and, at times, exhilarating to watch. There's nothing new here, of course, but everything in this coming-of-age story is done in such a good natured way that I just sat back and let myself pleasantly sink into the movie, and to blazes with the cliches. True, the romance is done by the numbers, but the thumpin', hip-swayin' soundtrack and the dynamic dance sequences go a long way to make the film palatable. Ultimately, I walked away from this film feeling pretty good. Still empty headed, and half-heartedly determined to learn the Crip Walk, yeah, but feeling good. And, now, I guess I'm ready to tackle STOMP THE YARD.",4,"""You feel like because you're a white boy you gotta overcompensate or something?

The script is filled with every clich&eacute; under the sun, and just when you thought that something unpredictable might happen, it doesn't. Right from the beginning, when a character's younger brother is introduced, I said to myself, ""Please don't make him be the lesson learned"". Let's just say that every teen romance and ghetto flick plot line is rehashed to the exact detail, without a whiff of originality.Channing Tatum performance was okay and not bad for someone who had worked for the Public Defender's Office specifically in juvenile court and plays his role as Tyler knowingly. In this movie he seems so insecure with himself until he hits the dance floor. At that moment he becomes the most confident person in the room because he has some serious skills. Nora (Jenna Darwin) just seems like your typical ballerina princess until she finally opens up about her life. The story is interesting enough to keep you in your seat until another dance scene. But, although the acting wasn't top notch I will say that the movie had an incredible moral lesson/theme if you will--about different 'worlds' coming together and how the view issues in life so differently. It also spends a lot of time on understanding differences in daily life and issues between both 'worlds.' In addition to this it teaches us about choices and accountability for our action.I also did enjoy the booming soundtrack. This may be the first film that would work better as a 90 minute music video, and save us from either uninspired dialogue, or mis-delivered dialogue. Sadly, even the dancing doesn't compare to previous dance films like ""Center Stage"", ""You Got Served"", and probably ""Honey"" but that is even stretching it.

Along the way, he stumbles upon the school's dance team and is particularly fascinated by a girl named Nora (Jenna Dewan).When Nora's dance partner for her senior showcase gets injured and is unable to perform, Tyler steps in as her partner.

Miles Darby is played by singer Mario who was also inFreedom Writers (Full Screen Edition).  Drew Sidora plays the supporting lead Lucy Avila, with a shallow depth and chronic smile.  Damaine Radcliff from ""Glory Road"" plays Tyler's buddy Mac Carter.  De'Shawn Washington plays Mac's brother Skinny.  Tim Lacatena has a nice cameo as the injured dancer Andrew.  Josh Henderson who was featured as Austin McCann on TV's ""Desperate Housewives"" plays Nora's boyfriend, the self-centered singer Brett Dolan.

The movie stars one of the most beautiful men in the world named Channing Tatum. Channing plays a guy named Tyler who is a foster kid living with a family who can care less about him. He hangs out with his friends Mac and Mac's little brother Skinny. Tyler and Mac steal cars and sell them. On Saturday nights, they stop in at their neighborhood club. One weekend night after being threatened by some thug, Tyler, Mac and Skinny run off in to the streets. Then Skinny decides to smash the window at the Maryland School of the Arts. After messing around on the stage in the school auditorium they end up getting busted by a security guard, and Tyler takes the blame for it. Tyler gets sentenced to 200 hours of community service at the Maryland School of the Arts, and at first wants nothing but to finish his time assisting the janitor. One day Tyler is making repairs on a ladder and sees some dancers trying out to be the partner for Nora Clark. Nora needs a stand in while her dance partner recovers. Tyler offers to be her partner, but she hesitates. When he convinces her that he is serious enough to be her dance partner the rest is history. Step Up is a great movie in the tradition of Save the Last Dance, and Honey. I have to say Channing's ability to move his body the way he does only adds to his charm.

1024756,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B000J3OTSM,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[6, 7]","Cons: I refused to see this movie because I was (and still am) so tired of Hollywood snubbing hip-hop.  The art of breaking and a lot of the dance that the main male character does was started in New York with Blacks and Latinos, and not just guys.  In every hip-hop movie, there has been a White female lead and this one was no different.  I knew the movie had something to do with ballet as well, but from the preview, it looked like another ""Save the Last Dance.""  I was thrilled when ""Idlewild"" came out, and finally some sistas got to show off what they could do on the hip-hop dance floors as well.  I refused to go see this movie off principle alone.  Even ""Breakin"" and ""Breakin 2"" had a white female lead.  It annoys me a great deal that even in this day and time, Hollywood is still so far behind and seems to take great joy in inaccuracy just to reach a broader audience.  When hip-hop was created, it reached a massive audience without trying to appeal to everybody, so why is it that there has NEVER been a major hip-hop movie with a black female lead? Sistas break too!  When I walk into a hip-hop club, I don't see a bunch of ballerinas poplocking and suddenly learning a dance that takes years to perfect, and that's exactly where I thought this movie was headed.Pros: I saw a much longer preview for this movie this past weekend and knew that I was going to finally give in and rent it.  I thought the main male character was so cute, especially in ""Coach Carter,"" and from the looks of it, he could GET IT on the dance floor and he had charisma.  Every single time he clenched his jaw or stared into the eyes of the female co-star, I was shouting at the t.v. ""Kiss her!  Please kiss her!""I love musicals (be it hip-hop to jazz to blues to pop), so I'd already been curious about the movie, but the principle kept me from seeing it.  I rented it last night and squealed with delight.  Those two were such a cute couple, he was an excellent hip-hop dancer (not that 1-2-3 step type of deal either--he dances from the heart), I liked the end performance, and I love the way there was a twist to his background. Now I understand why he was the character that he was, and it's believeable.  Even better, unlike ""Save the Last Dance,"" both of these star characters REALLY can dance. I can't stand to see a musical where it looks like the dancers are counting steps.  Dancing is something you have to feel in your soul.  It's wild because I'm begging people to get me this movie for Christmas. Now how's that for a twist?Cons (once seeing the movie): Mario isn't a very good actor, but he sure can work a hat!

In fact, the story of ""Step Up"" reminded me of ""The Cutting Edge,"" where the chemistry of the two leads somehow manages to carry the implausible story to the end. In `Step Up"" same thing happens. The film has beautifully choreographed dancing scenes, and its soundtrack is also impressive, but don't try to find unpredictable stories or Tarantino-like dialogues.While doing community service at the Baltimore's art school, street dancer Tyler (Channing Tatum) offers his skills to help Nora (Jenna Dewan), aspiring ballet dancer whose dance partner got injured recently. Through the events that follow, such as reluctant permission given from Director Gordon (Rachel Griffith), Tyler finds himself attracted to Nora, or vice versa. And this sure-fire boys-meet-girls scenario works better than you expect thanks to the two leads with enough chemistry, natural personalities and dancing talent.Choreographer-turned-director Anne Fletcher successfully combines two different types of dances in the film's concluding part with amazingly beautiful dances, but ""Step Up"" takes too much time to reach there. Unlike Baz Luhrmann's hilarious ""Strictly Ballroom"" many scenes of ""Step Up"" covers the materials such as car theft and street gang, topics that have been used in other films in a better way.
