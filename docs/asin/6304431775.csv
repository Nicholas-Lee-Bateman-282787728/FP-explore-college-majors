421298,A1B3HGBE9GAI08,6304431775,Jeremy Heilman,"[8, 9]","Hal Hartley appears to be an acquired taste...  I have only seen 3 of his films so far (this, the flat-out brilliant Trust, and the okay Henry Fool) but he's clearly one of the most underappreciated American directors working today. I think the delivery of his dialogue is what kills it for most people. It's very deliberate and generally not filled with an overkill of emotion. I find this approach allows me to listen to what the characters are actually saying (as opposed to just how they're saying it). That Hartley's one of the few screenwriters with something to actually say really seals the deal.I don't want to suggest Flirt lacks emotion though. It manages to pack in more complex emotions that most more histrionic films. In one scene, a man threatens another with a gun, reconciles with him, embraces him, has a change of heart, and shoots him. A woman who witnesses this, hearing some music that begins to play, begins to dance, caught in the moment, slips to the ground, and gets up regaining her sense of reality. This sounds absurdist, and it plays that way in the film. Still, it manages to convey a great deal of human emotions in about a minute without a false note. Hartley is a master at achieving a desired effect.Flirt is somewhat experimental in that it replays the same narrative with nearly the same dialogue in three different countries with three different casts. This never felt boring to me, as the intention of some of the lines and the overall outcome of the situation changes each time. What's interesting is that the plot of the episodes is that the character has 90 minutes to make up their mind about whether their relationship has a future. Not coincidentally, the film is 90 minutes long. Clearly Hartley is commenting on the use of art (screenwriting, film direction) to solve personal demons. One feels he is using this film to explore a personal dilemma for himself, a point that is driven home when Hartley himself shows up in the third episode as the possibly spurned lover.It's interesting that such an apparent act of directorial vanity never feels like hubris. Hartley manages to make an extremely personal film that actually has something universal to say. He manages to be stylistically bold without being gaudy or excessive. He manages to make the same plot interesting three times. He manages to create a masterpiece in ""Flirt"".",5,A Hal Hartley masterpiece,1000944000,"09 20, 2001",2001,2378,"['Hal', 'Hartley', 'be', 'acquired', 'taste', 'have', 'only', 'seen', '3', 'films', 'so', 'far', 'flat-out', 'brilliant', 'Trust', 'okay', 'Henry', 'Fool', 'clearly', 'one', 'most', 'underappreciated', 'American', 'directors', 'working', 'today', 'think', 'delivery', 'dialogue', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'very', 'deliberate', 'generally', 'not', 'filled', 'overkill', 'emotion', 'find', 'approach', 'listen', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'saying', 'opposed', 'just', 'how', ""'re"", 'saying', 'Hartley', 'one', 'few', 'screenwriters', 'something', 'actually', 'say', 'really', 'deal.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'suggest', 'Flirt', 'emotion', 'pack', 'more', 'complex', 'emotions', 'most', 'more', 'histrionic', 'films', 'one', 'scene', 'man', 'gun', 'reconciles', 'change', 'heart', 'shoots', 'woman', 'who', 'hearing', 'music', 'play', 'dance', 'caught', 'moment', 'ground', 'up', 'regaining', 'sense', 'reality', 'absurdist', 'way', 'film', 'Still', 'convey', 'great', 'deal', 'human', 'emotions', 'minute', 'false', 'note', 'Hartley', 'master', 'achieving', 'desired', 'effect.Flirt', 'somewhat', 'experimental', 'same', 'narrative', 'nearly', 'same', 'dialogue', 'three', 'different', 'countries', 'three', 'different', 'casts', 'never', 'felt', 'boring', 'intention', 'lines', 'overall', 'outcome', 'situation', 'time', 'What', 'interesting', 'plot', 'episodes', 'character', '90', 'minutes', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'relationship', 'future', 'Not', 'coincidentally', 'film', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'Clearly', 'Hartley', 'commenting', 'use', 'art', 'screenwriting', 'film', 'direction', 'solve', 'personal', 'demons', 'One', 'feels', 'using', 'film', 'explore', 'personal', 'dilemma', 'point', 'driven', 'home', 'when', 'Hartley', 'up', 'third', 'episode', 'possibly', 'spurned', 'lover.It', 'interesting', 'apparent', 'act', 'directorial', 'vanity', 'never', 'feels', 'hubris', 'Hartley', 'make', 'extremely', 'personal', 'film', 'actually', 'something', 'universal', 'say', 'be', 'stylistically', 'bold', 'being', 'gaudy', 'excessive', 'make', 'same', 'plot', 'interesting', 'three', 'times', 'create', 'masterpiece', 'Flirt']",Flirt VHS

I thought it was as creative as most Hal Hartley films, and pulled off with a great style and flair to it.  If you think you should go see this simply becaue  Paker Posey's in it, don't waste your time.  She has a very small part in  the beginning, but then she slips into obscurity.  The first two stories,  in New York and in Berlin, are very entertaining.  The Tokyo one bored me  though. (Even though all three are essentially the same story, but then  thats what makes this such an incredibly creative movie!)  This one is  gonna appeal mostly to the indie, artsy fartsy tyes.

421301,A3RKS9KC04UXJP,6304431775,Steven R. Severance,"[0, 0]","In this film Hal Hartley tells basically the same story three times over: once in N.Y., once in Berlin, and once in Tokyo. THere are variations in each telling but you might get bored. Part of the third version is done Noh style and I wish Hartley hard done the whole third version that way. That is by far my favorite prt of the film. It is pretty riviting. Hartley is more interested in meta fiction though. we leave the Noh to focus on the actors lives and in places leave the film to focus on the film making. Well if you liked how Borges did this like 70 years ago you might like it in this film too but I think it is a rather tired concept.  SO... I just relish the film for its style and visuals.",4,visually rich but intentionally repeated plot,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,703,"['film', 'Hal', 'Hartley', 'basically', 'same', 'story', 'three', 'times', 'once', 'N.Y.', 'once', 'Berlin', 'once', 'Tokyo', 'are', 'variations', 'telling', 'might', 'get', 'bored', 'Part', 'third', 'version', 'done', 'Noh', 'style', 'wish', 'Hartley', 'hard', 'done', 'whole', 'third', 'version', 'way', 'far', 'favorite', 'prt', 'film', 'pretty', 'riviting', 'Hartley', 'more', 'interested', 'meta', 'fiction', 'leave', 'Noh', 'focus', 'actors', 'lives', 'places', 'leave', 'film', 'focus', 'film', 'making', 'Well', 'liked', 'how', 'Borges', 'did', '70', 'years', 'ago', 'might', 'like', 'film', 'too', 'think', 'rather', 'tired', 'concept', 'just', 'relish', 'film', 'style', 'visuals']",Flirt VHS
