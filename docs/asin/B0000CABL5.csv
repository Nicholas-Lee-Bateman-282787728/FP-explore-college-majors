775084,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0000CABL5,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[11, 11]","I hate reality TV.  I loathe it.  Reality TV consists of some of the worst shows in television history, like The Swan and The Littlest Groom.  However, these shows are so popular with viewers and with networks that scripted shows are cancelled in order to make room for more reality junk (The WB admitted that it cancelled its long-running show Angel because they needed more reality).  However, there is but one reality TV show that is not only good, it is one of the funniest shows that I have ever seen.The premise of the Jamie Kennedy Experiment, or JKX, is that Jamie, the host of a million faces, goes into disguise to &quot;X&quot; unsuspecting people.  He has characters like Brad &quot;B-Rad&quot; Gluckman, the Jewish rapper from Malibu, a mobster who runs a pizza parlor, and Virginia Hamm, an African-American talk-show host.  Yes, Jamie not only dresses up as a black woman, he passes for one!  Kennedy is truly a master of disguise who can change his appearance and voice with ease.The reason that this show works, despite its reality TV genre, is that Jamie isn't over the top, isn't shameless (most of the time), and he gives people what they want.  There are too many shows like Fear Factor where the whole idea is to gross out participants and viewers.  Sadly, I doubt that this show will ever be the first to come to mind when talking about reality TV in the future, but it sure deserves to be.Some geat bits were the Spring Break jokes, the pizza delivery guy, the driving instructor, anything with Brad Gluckman, and the one where Jamie tried to X a fellow WB star.",5,The ONLY Good Reality Show On TV,1084665600,"05 16, 2004",2004,1586,"['hate', 'reality', 'TV', 'loathe', 'Reality', 'TV', 'worst', 'shows', 'television', 'history', 'Swan', 'Littlest', 'Groom', 'However', 'shows', 'are', 'so', 'popular', 'viewers', 'networks', 'scripted', 'shows', 'are', 'cancelled', 'order', 'make', 'room', 'more', 'reality', 'junk', 'WB', 'admitted', 'cancelled', 'long-running', 'show', 'Angel', 'needed', 'more', 'reality', 'However', 'one', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'one', 'funniest', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'premise', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'Experiment', 'JKX', 'Jamie', 'host', 'million', 'disguise', 'quot', 'X', 'quot', 'unsuspecting', 'people', 'characters', 'Brad', 'quot', 'B-Rad', 'quot', 'Gluckman', 'Jewish', 'rapper', 'Malibu', 'mobster', 'who', 'pizza', 'parlor', 'Virginia', 'Hamm', 'African-American', 'talk-show', 'host', 'Yes', 'Jamie', 'not', 'only', 'up', 'black', 'woman', 'one', 'Kennedy', 'truly', 'master', 'disguise', 'who', 'can', 'change', 'appearance', 'voice', 'ease.The', 'reason', 'show', 'reality', 'TV', 'genre', 'Jamie', ""n't"", 'top', ""n't"", 'shameless', 'most', 'time', 'people', 'what', 'want', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'shows', 'Fear', 'Factor', 'where', 'whole', 'idea', 'gross', 'participants', 'viewers', 'Sadly', 'doubt', 'show', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'first', 'come', 'mind', 'when', 'talking', 'reality', 'TV', 'future', 'sure', 'be.Some', 'geat', 'bits', 'were', 'Spring', 'Break', 'jokes', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'guy', 'driving', 'instructor', 'anything', 'Brad', 'Gluckman', 'one', 'where', 'Jamie', 'tried', 'X', 'fellow', 'WB', 'star']",The Jamie Kennedy Experiment - The Complete First Season

775086,A1K31NF81TS0CO,B0000CABL5,"Dubyac99 ""Dubyac99""","[8, 8]","Wow!  I love this series!  I'll never forget the first time I saw this show!  Please join me on a journey, while I tell you about my favorite hidden camera show.I happen to be flipping channels, and ended up on the WB, one Thursday night, about 9 p.m.  I saw Jamie Kennedy introducing a segment.  He was explaining about a new rapper sensation, named Brad Gluckman.  I was distracted, temporarily, by my young newborn son.  I began watching the segment, laughing my head off, and thinking Brad Gluckman was so funny.  Who was this guy?  It wasn't until the end of the segment, and Jamie made the reveal, that I realized Jamie Kennedy and Brad Gluckman were one and the same.  And I realized at that moment that I had found my new favorite Hidden Camera show!After that I was hooked every Thursday.  I even converted some of my relatives and friends over to the Jamie Kennedy addiction.  I then began taping every show I could find.  Of course, I had a load of VHS tapes, after this.When the DVD was announced, I knew that my prayers had been answered. I reserved this immediately, and bought it on launch day.  Now I can watch and rewatch my favorite episodes over and over again.Some of my favorite episodes:1) Jamie pretends to be a Yoga Instructor.  He gets into a pickle, when some outside workers don't take kindly to his cursing at them, and enter his Yoga studio seeking justice.  My favorite line:  when one of the actors is confronted by a rather large, burly construction worker he states:  ""I'm bigger than you, and stronger than you, and more powerful.  Hmmmmmm. (humming).  The large man then proceeds to toss his body into a metal door like a ragdoll.  (No, he was not hurt, he was a stuntman.)2) Spring Break in Florida, and Jamie dresses up as a ""hot chick"" who very obviously wants to hook up with an unsuspecting male spring breaker.  Ohh, and its REALLY obvious Jamie is a ""dude.""  This, despite the mark's friend's (who's in on the joke) insistence that Jamie is not a dude, and to just stick it out.3) Jamie plays a boss, interviewing a job candidate.  They are interrupted by Jamie's male boyfriend, actor A, who confronts him about his flirting with another male friend at a party.  Jamie is married, and of course his wife shows up to complicate matters.  The job candidate is then asked to pretend to be ""friends"" with Actor A.  Halarity ensues.I could go on, but I don't want to spoil the fun.  I highly suggest you purchase this one.Only complaint, would be, it would be nice to see more special materials, such as behind the scenes filming of the behind the scenes folks who make these gags works.  We rarely get a chance to see their side of the story. The commentaries are nice, but Jamie sounds half asleep (which he apologizes for on Season 2 DVD's commentary, see my review.)All in all, very well done, and supper funny.  I like the outside jacket artwork and photos, and the disc covers as well.Great job Jamie!",5,Welcome to Brad Gluckman World,1100217600,"11 12, 2004",2004,2945,"['love', 'series', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'show', 'Please', 'join', 'journey', 'tell', 'favorite', 'hidden', 'camera', 'show.I', 'happen', 'be', 'flipping', 'channels', 'ended', 'up', 'WB', 'one', 'Thursday', 'night', 'about', '9', 'p.m', 'saw', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'introducing', 'segment', 'was', 'explaining', 'new', 'rapper', 'sensation', 'named', 'Brad', 'Gluckman', 'was', 'distracted', 'temporarily', 'young', 'newborn', 'son', 'began', 'watching', 'segment', 'laughing', 'head', 'thinking', 'Brad', 'Gluckman', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'Who', 'was', 'guy', 'was', ""n't"", 'end', 'segment', 'Jamie', 'made', 'reveal', 'realized', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'Brad', 'Gluckman', 'were', 'one', 'same', 'realized', 'moment', 'had', 'found', 'new', 'favorite', 'Hidden', 'Camera', 'show', 'was', 'hooked', 'Thursday', 'even', 'converted', 'relatives', 'friends', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'addiction', 'then', 'began', 'taping', 'show', 'could', 'find', 'course', 'had', 'load', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'DVD', 'was', 'announced', 'knew', 'prayers', 'had', 'been', 'answered', 'reserved', 'immediately', 'bought', 'launch', 'day', 'Now', 'can', 'watch', 'rewatch', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'again.Some', 'favorite', 'episodes:1', 'Jamie', 'be', 'Yoga', 'Instructor', 'pickle', 'when', 'outside', 'workers', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'kindly', 'cursing', 'enter', 'Yoga', 'studio', 'seeking', 'justice', 'favorite', 'line', 'when', 'one', 'actors', 'confronted', 'rather', 'large', 'burly', 'construction', 'worker', ""'m"", 'bigger', 'stronger', 'more', 'powerful', 'Hmmmmmm', 'humming', 'large', 'man', 'then', 'toss', 'body', 'metal', 'door', 'ragdoll', 'No', 'was', 'not', 'hurt', 'was', 'stuntman', '2', 'Spring', 'Break', 'Florida', 'Jamie', 'up', 'hot', 'chick', 'who', 'very', 'obviously', 'hook', 'up', 'unsuspecting', 'male', 'spring', 'breaker', 'Ohh', 'REALLY', 'obvious', 'Jamie', 'dude', 'mark', 'friend', 'who', 'joke', 'insistence', 'Jamie', 'not', 'dude', 'just', 'stick', 'Jamie', 'boss', 'interviewing', 'job', 'candidate', 'are', 'interrupted', 'Jamie', 'male', 'boyfriend', 'actor', 'A', 'who', 'flirting', 'male', 'friend', 'party', 'Jamie', 'married', 'course', 'wife', 'up', 'complicate', 'matters', 'job', 'candidate', 'then', 'asked', 'pretend', 'be', 'friends', 'Actor', 'A.', 'Halarity', 'ensues.I', 'could', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'fun', 'highly', 'suggest', 'purchase', 'one.Only', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'special', 'materials', 'such', 'scenes', 'filming', 'scenes', 'folks', 'who', 'make', 'gags', 'works', 'rarely', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'side', 'story', 'commentaries', 'are', 'nice', 'Jamie', 'half', 'asleep', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'see', 'review', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'supper', 'funny', 'outside', 'jacket', 'artwork', 'photos', 'disc', 'well.Great', 'job', 'Jamie']",The Jamie Kennedy Experiment - The Complete First Season

Some of these hoaxes must have taken months to plot and plan. The result is some pretty funny stuff. There is also a very lame trick of having Kennedy pretend to have jaw surgery and needing to have his mouth wired open. This pathetic stunt is repeated several times throughout the first season - which hints that they were running out of ideas even then. Still, some great, hilarious bits. But it isn't an experiment.
