And this one meets up to their high level of quality.  It is a story about Rossini, but while sticking true to the main historical facts, the film includes a young girl who gets to meet him through her Grandmother and her Grandmother's friend, a former rival.  This movie presents Rossini in a very likeable fashion and the series appeals to both the young kid viewers and adults, who will benefit from the historical aspects of it.  This is truly quality programming.  It introduces one to opera and ballet and leaves one with a feeling of awe for both the composer and the art form.  Wonderful for a family evening.",5,Wonderful film.,1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,705,"['movies', 'series', 'produced', 'Devine', 'Entertainment', 'are', 'just', 'exceptional', 'one', 'high', 'level', 'quality', 'story', 'Rossini', 'sticking', 'true', 'main', 'historical', 'facts', 'film', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'meet', 'Grandmother', 'Grandmother', 'friend', 'former', 'rival', 'movie', 'Rossini', 'very', 'likeable', 'fashion', 'series', 'appeals', 'young', 'kid', 'viewers', 'adults', 'who', 'will', 'benefit', 'historical', 'aspects', 'truly', 'quality', 'programming', 'one', 'opera', 'ballet', 'one', 'feeling', 'awe', 'composer', 'art', 'form', 'Wonderful', 'family', 'evening']",Rossini's Ghost VHS

If you are interested in biographies or opera, the DVD is probably not going to stand up to competition.  However, if you are hoping to awaken a muse in a child who loves dance or theater, this might be a user-friendly approach.  The costuming is good.  The bits and pieces of music are well-performed.  The film is free of vulgarity but flirtatious. It's not serious entertainment so if looking for a light respite from more serious matters, it can be a good space breaker.",4,Cute,1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,656,"['Obviously', 'fantasy', 'film', 'charm', 'will', 'appeal', 'children', 'perhaps', 'even', 'adults', 'who', 'like', 'reminisce', 'allow', 'imaginations', 'go', 'free', 'fall', 'are', 'interested', 'biographies', 'opera', 'DVD', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'stand', 'up', 'competition', 'However', 'are', 'hoping', 'awaken', 'muse', 'child', 'who', 'dance', 'theater', 'might', 'be', 'user-friendly', 'approach', 'costuming', 'good', 'bits', 'pieces', 'music', 'are', 'well-performed', 'film', 'free', 'vulgarity', 'flirtatious', 'not', 'serious', 'entertainment', 'so', 'looking', 'light', 'respite', 'more', 'serious', 'matters', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'space', 'breaker']",Rossini's Ghost VHS

My daughter loved it, she wanted to see it again and again. This film was also very hard to borrow from our local public library since it is so popular, more than other films of this series.It had wonderful historical/cultural setting, beautful costumes. The action of the film was fast, vivid and positive. The girl, a ghost, was sweet. I wish the girl who played the role was a bit more convincing, especially in the beginning. Besides, all actors were very good. The film gave some ideas not only about Rossinim his most known opera (The Barber of Seville) and his music but about the times he lived in.I recommend it to all!",5,Charming movie,1267142400,"02 26, 2010",2010,690,"['film', 'was', 'one', 'bestfilms', 'composers', 'series', 'daughter', 'loved', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'hard', 'borrow', 'local', 'public', 'library', 'so', 'popular', 'more', 'other', 'films', 'series.It', 'had', 'wonderful', 'historical/cultural', 'setting', 'beautful', 'costumes', 'action', 'film', 'was', 'fast', 'vivid', 'positive', 'girl', 'ghost', 'was', 'sweet', 'wish', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'role', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'convincing', 'especially', 'beginning', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'gave', 'ideas', 'not', 'only', 'Rossinim', 'most', 'known', 'opera', 'Barber', 'Seville', 'music', 'times', 'lived', 'in.I', 'recommend']",Rossini's Ghost VHS

408364,A1JEFESGLIS076,6304230095,rsoonsa,"[9, 9]","This short (52 min.) film is from Canadian producer/writer/director David Devine's Composers' Special series, and relates a fanciful story adding a child into the life of a great composer, as with the other works of the series. In 1862 Italy, young Reliana (Melissa Pirrera) visits her grandmother Rosalie (Frances Bay) to help make sauce for pasta, the two soon visited by Rosalie's best friend Martina (Lally Cadeau), with the two women joining issue over facts concerning their treasured shared relationship with the great Gioacchino Rossini, 46 years prior. Served by a strategem of fantasy, Reliana is transmitted back to 1816 where she is visible only to the composer, who is preparing for the opening of the Barber of Seville at the Argentina Theatre in Rome, and where she espies a disgruntled tenor place a curse upon the upcoming production. The curse, one must note, is supposititious, but the premiere of the Barber was in fact calamitous, and Reliana watches as the young Martina (Janne Mortil) as the opera's diva, and the young Rosalie (Margaret Illmann), as the featured dancer, each in love with Rossini, squabble and suffer as the opening night crowd hisses the ill-starred performance. Despite its brevity, the effectively scripted work manages to include many precise elements material to Rossini's life and to the Barber, including the small amount of time in which Rossini supposedly composed the work (13 days), the uneasy backing of Duke Cesarini (Tony Nardi), and the composer's reputation as a gourmet. The beautiful Illmann, for many years prima ballerina of Canada's National Ballet, dances with charm in her solo, and easily takes the acting honors with a nuanced performance exactly right for her role. There is seldom an instance when one of eight Rossini overtures is not heard, played well by the Slovak Philharmonic under the baton of Ondrij Lenard, and this Canadian/Slovak production, filmed in Istria and Slovakia, is graced by exquisite, and largely accurate, designs from the wardrobe specialists.",4,A PLEASANTLY RENDERED MIXTURE.,1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,2036,"['short', '52', 'min', 'film', 'Canadian', 'producer/writer/director', 'David', 'Devine', 'Composers', 'Special', 'series', 'fanciful', 'story', 'adding', 'child', 'life', 'great', 'composer', 'other', 'works', 'series', '1862', 'Italy', 'young', 'Reliana', 'Melissa', 'Pirrera', 'grandmother', 'Rosalie', 'Frances', 'Bay', 'help', 'make', 'sauce', 'pasta', 'two', 'soon', 'visited', 'Rosalie', 'best', 'friend', 'Martina', 'Lally', 'Cadeau', 'two', 'women', 'joining', 'issue', 'facts', 'concerning', 'treasured', 'shared', 'relationship', 'great', 'Gioacchino', 'Rossini', '46', 'years', 'prior', 'Served', 'strategem', 'fantasy', 'Reliana', 'transmitted', 'back', '1816', 'where', 'visible', 'only', 'composer', 'who', 'preparing', 'opening', 'Barber', 'Seville', 'Argentina', 'Theatre', 'Rome', 'where', 'disgruntled', 'tenor', 'place', 'curse', 'upcoming', 'production', 'curse', 'one', 'must', 'note', 'supposititious', 'premiere', 'Barber', 'was', 'fact', 'calamitous', 'Reliana', 'watches', 'young', 'Martina', 'Janne', 'Mortil', 'opera', 'diva', 'young', 'Rosalie', 'Margaret', 'Illmann', 'featured', 'dancer', 'love', 'Rossini', 'squabble', 'suffer', 'opening', 'night', 'crowd', 'ill-starred', 'performance', 'brevity', 'effectively', 'scripted', 'work', 'manages', 'include', 'many', 'precise', 'elements', 'material', 'Rossini', 'life', 'Barber', 'including', 'small', 'amount', 'time', 'Rossini', 'supposedly', 'composed', 'work', '13', 'days', 'uneasy', 'backing', 'Duke', 'Cesarini', 'Tony', 'Nardi', 'composer', 'reputation', 'gourmet', 'beautiful', 'Illmann', 'many', 'years', 'prima', 'ballerina', 'Canada', 'National', 'Ballet', 'charm', 'solo', 'easily', 'acting', 'honors', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'exactly', 'right', 'role', 'seldom', 'instance', 'when', 'one', 'eight', 'Rossini', 'overtures', 'not', 'heard', 'played', 'well', 'Slovak', 'Philharmonic', 'baton', 'Ondrij', 'Lenard', 'Canadian/Slovak', 'production', 'filmed', 'Istria', 'Slovakia', 'graced', 'exquisite', 'largely', 'accurate', 'designs', 'wardrobe', 'specialists']",Rossini's Ghost VHS
