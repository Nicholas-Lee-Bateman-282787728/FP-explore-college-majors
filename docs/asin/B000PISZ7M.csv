1071577,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000PISZ7M,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","A heron flies across a country road in Montana. [No dog to bark a warning about visitors?] The cowboy is told about an imprisoned terrorist in London; does he know too much? Armed police patrol the London airport. [Are messages still passed in matchbooks? Would burning matches set off a smoke alarm?] The Contractor climbs into a steeple to perform his assigned task. The police seal off the area and stop cars from leaving. Will the Contractor escape? Will the surveillance cameras record all people? High-level police officers confer about this problem.Why is there no help at the safe house? Would a young girl be so helpful to a stranger? Will he be recognized at the airport? The armed British police shoot at him. So does another person. If Jackson can't fly out of the country where will he go? Will the British SWAT team succeed in locating the fugitive? Could forensics identify the pistol that shot Superintendent Windsor? [Does the story get bogged down in the middle?] There is another chase through crowded streets. The British SWAT team uses H&K; MP-5 machine guns like their US counterparts. Every telephone is Britain is tapped! [George Orwell's ""1984"" warned about this.] Will they intercept Jackson's call? Will the sound of gunshots alarm the public? There is a chase in the Underground. [A hooded jacket hides a person's face.]There is another shoot-out in the kitchen of a hotel, done for dramatic effect. It doesn't disguise the lack of a good story. ""It was never personal"", they just followed orders. At the end Jackson rides out of town, like some cowboy in some old western movie. It is not a good ending. The use of mercenary assassins by a government is a topic that deserves a better film that this. You can read Norman Lewis' ""The Sicilian Specialist"", or Richard Condon's novels ""Winter Kills"" or ""The Manchurian Candidate"". Note that a professional killer will use a rifle so he can escape to collect his payment.

Wesley Snipes is an angry, laconic ex-CIA killer, a marksman, who failed to kill an Arab terrorist in the past and, although retired, is asked by his former handler to shoot and kill the terrorist, to finish what he didn't finish before. He is joined by a partner he doesn't trust. Events go wrong in England after the shooting and Snipes is pursued by the English police who want to arrest him as well has his former handler and men of his squad who are trying to kill him. Snipes is helped by a young girl who says she ""lies all the time."" The American handler tries to work with the English police but the senior officer doesn't trust him.Viewers will enjoy trying to figure out what is going on. Even if they can figure it out because they have seen many such films, they will still enjoy seeing how it is played out in this version. Is this a rogue CIA operation? Is Snipes the rogue agent?

Set in London, it has a good supporting cast of English actors including Charles Dance, Lena Headey and young Eliza Bennett. For the most part, it's a standard action story, and the occasional dramatic scenes feel a bit out of place, especially those between the young girl and her grandmother.

1071584,A32ZCNO9YI0JP6,B000PISZ7M,Patricia Huerta,"[12, 13]","The Contractor, formerly known as The Shooter, and not to be confused with Mark Wahlberg's ""Shooter"" is a movie starring Wesley Snipes as a CIA agent who is assigned to kill a terrorist, only to be framed for another murder. To complicate things more, Snipes will make friends with a teenager who will become his most valuable ally.I have to say I find this film very straightforward, unimaginative, hardly believable on certain aspects, and just mildly entertaining. At times it feels like an amateur attempt to create a movie and innovate certain cinematographic aspects, but stays as an attempt. Even Lena Headey, who I always find her acting abilities exceptional, feels weak as Inspector Ballard, the one in charge of bringing Dial (Snipes) down. Eliza Bennet as the teenage girl who helps Snipes makes a very good job, even if certain aspects of her character are not believable. It's obviously not her fault, it's the writers'.So I rate this movie as an average movie, with certain plot holes and pointless scenes. If you want some decent stuff by Wesley Snipes, take a shot, and there's the plus of having Lena Headey in it.It's 90 minutes where you can enjoy a movie if you're not feeling too picky.",3,Just OK... well maybe not zero-killed,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,1208,"['Contractor', 'formerly', 'known', 'Shooter', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Shooter', 'movie', 'starring', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'assigned', 'kill', 'terrorist', 'only', 'be', 'framed', 'murder', 'complicate', 'things', 'more', 'Snipes', 'will', 'make', 'friends', 'teenager', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'most', 'valuable', 'ally.I', 'have', 'say', 'find', 'film', 'very', 'straightforward', 'unimaginative', 'hardly', 'believable', 'certain', 'aspects', 'just', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'times', 'amateur', 'attempt', 'create', 'movie', 'innovate', 'certain', 'cinematographic', 'aspects', 'attempt', 'Even', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'who', 'always', 'find', 'acting', 'abilities', 'exceptional', 'feels', 'weak', 'Inspector', 'Ballard', 'one', 'charge', 'bringing', 'Dial', 'Snipes', 'down', 'Eliza', 'Bennet', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'Snipes', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'even', 'certain', 'aspects', 'character', 'are', 'not', 'believable', 'obviously', 'not', 'fault', ""writers'.So"", 'rate', 'movie', 'average', 'movie', 'certain', 'plot', 'holes', 'pointless', 'scenes', 'want', 'decent', 'stuff', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'take', 'shot', 'plus', 'having', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'it.It', '90', 'minutes', 'where', 'can', 'enjoy', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'feeling', 'too', 'picky']",The Contractor

1071586,A9PRJA8LIZL9S,B000PISZ7M,Rantings Of a Girl,"[3, 3]","Overall, while not the best thriller I've seen, I enjoyed it.Like several other reviewers have already stated, this movie's story is similar to other movies, much better movies with stronger stories.  It's the overdone plot, man gets hired to assasinate someone, then the tables turn and the hunter becomes the hunted, thrown in a little ""I was framed"" for good measure, and you've just about got the story.However, for me, there was one major addition that set this movie apart from being just another thriller, and that was the relationship the hunter (Snipes) has with the next door neighbor, a teenage girl.  No, no hanky panky, just a lonely girl seeking someone to talk to and help.  Snipes ends up seeking solace at his side kick's (who got killed) safe house when things go bad, and the girl becomes his new best friend.  Despite Snipes best attempts to get rid of the girl and have her stop bothering him, he ends up enlisting her help as he recovers and tries to figure out who framed him, and how to get out of England.Also add Scotland Yard Inspector, Lena Headly (pre Sarah Connor Chronicles tv series), who did a great job as well, and ends up helping Snipes, who she had previously believed killer her partner.Good movie, not great, but good enough that I will add it to my 'to buy' list.",3,Tea:  I do believe a half cup would be lovely,1280620800,"08 1, 2010",2010,1303,"['Overall', 'not', 'best', 'thriller', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'it.Like', 'several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'stated', 'movie', 'story', 'similar', 'other', 'movies', 'much', 'better', 'movies', 'stronger', 'stories', 'overdone', 'plot', 'man', 'hired', 'assasinate', 'someone', 'then', 'tables', 'turn', 'hunter', 'hunted', 'thrown', 'little', 'was', 'framed', 'good', 'measure', ""'ve"", 'just', 'got', 'story.However', 'was', 'one', 'major', 'addition', 'set', 'movie', 'apart', 'being', 'just', 'thriller', 'was', 'relationship', 'hunter', 'Snipes', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'teenage', 'girl', 'No', 'hanky', 'panky', 'just', 'lonely', 'girl', 'seeking', 'someone', 'talk', 'help', 'Snipes', 'up', 'seeking', 'solace', 'side', 'kick', 'who', 'got', 'killed', 'safe', 'house', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'girl', 'new', 'best', 'friend', 'Snipes', 'best', 'attempts', 'get', 'rid', 'girl', 'have', 'stop', 'bothering', 'up', 'enlisting', 'help', 'tries', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'framed', 'how', 'get', 'England.Also', 'add', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'Inspector', 'Lena', 'Headly', 'pre', 'Sarah', 'Connor', 'Chronicles', 'tv', 'series', 'who', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'up', 'helping', 'Snipes', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'believed', 'killer', 'partner.Good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'good', 'enough', 'will', 'add', ""'to"", 'buy', 'list']",The Contractor
1071587,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B000PISZ7M,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","The Contractor(released July/10) stars,among others,Wesley Snipes as James Dial,Eliza Bennett as Emily Day,Lena Headey as Inspector Annette Ballard,Ralph Brown as Jeremy Collins,Charles Dance as Chief Superintendent Andrew Windsor and Gemma Jones as Mrs Day.This is yet another in an unspeakably long line of such films dealing with covert ops agencies,getting into trouble in foreign lands,portrayed as&#34;rogue&#34; by their superiors,and having to fight for their life and justice.However this film has just enough of a unique story line that it takes it up a notch to become a quite satisfying flicker.The story intro's us to James Dial,a secret black ops agent.Years before in the military he had a chance to take down a well known terrorist,but he narrowly let him slip through his fingers.Today,at his home in the mountains,he is being approached by his agency,specifically an agent Collins,who offers him a final chance to take down the one that got away.He accepts and lands in London,being greeted by a British contact there who goes under the name of Mr.Whitley.Disguised as a priest Dial enters a church to climb the steeple tower.There he has a birds eye view as the British authorities unload the terrorist and walk him inside.Dial is unable to get a clean shot outside,so he waits for his chance and gets him inside.The police are immediately swarming the entire vicinity and Dial and Whitley try desperately to elude them.Their trail gets picked up quickly,and the chase is on.It ends with the car upside down on stairs leading to a subway.Whitley is dead and Dial barely makes it out,setting his briefcase to explode as he does.Dial flees to Whitley's apartment to nurse his wounds.A 14 year old,Emily,who lives in the building notices Dials entrance.She lives next door to Mr Whitley,with her grandmother.Knowing Mr.Whitley well and being a precocious and nosy girl,she enters Mr Whitley's apartment under the pretense of looking for a cat,which she doesn't own.The two slowly become friends and the girl makes it her business to help Dial anyway she can.When Dial is well enough he ventures outside to make a call to Collins.He realizes Collins set him up and doesn't disclose his location.Collins puts pressure on the local constabulary to disclose any info on Dial they get and he makes it clear that he wants him back.Chief Superintendent Windsor and his daughter Inspector Ballard,on the case,do not trust Collins and vow to tell them very little.Dial meanwhile makes a dash for it at the airport.He only gets so far and is forced to flee into the bowels of the airport facility.There Collins and his minions follow and try to kill Dial.Dial gets away from them but is caught by the Chief Superintendent.He in turn is shot dead by Collins.Dial flees back to the apartment.Dial's next move is to get a passport.He goes to a well known forger and pays half down for a fake,intending to return later when it is done.However the police have been tipped off by the owner himself and are awaiting Dial upon his arrival.Emily goes with Dial to the passport office and offers to go ahead to make sure there's no police there.She walks in and sees nothing untoward and walks out.The police however are there.She gives Dial the prearranged signal for the all clear and he starts walking towards the office.In the meantime Emily has spotted Collins and his men coming in from a back area and she runs to warn Dial.Dial gets the other prearranged signal and he runs for it.The chase ends up in the subway system and two of Collins men are taken out,and Dial escapes.Dial now changes tack,and contacts the Inspector directly.He arranges to meet her alone in an abandoned mall.When they meet Dial hands over the evidence he has on Collins and his activities.He tells her that it was Collins who killed her father,not he.Collins however has tapped the Inspectors phone and he is there with his men.A shoot out starts and Dial while shot,is able to save the life of the Inspector,who both flee the mall.Collins chases Dial into a restaurant and the final shootout occurs,and Dial is the last man standing,with yet another bullet wound to show for it.The police now have the evidence on Collins and a video of him shooting the Superintendent and Dial is cleared.Dial says a tearful goodbye to his young friend as he leaves on a tram and for America.The film comes to a close as Emily and her grandmother receive two fares to Dials' ranch in the States.There Dial,with Emily's help,releases one of his prized horses into the wild.If this film had just been about Snipes being accused of going rogue and fighting his way back for exoneration,it would have joined a pantheon of other such related films in the genre.However this one takes it to another level by introducing Emily.He not only has to look after himself and Emily too,but the two become close friends through the turmoil they encounter.That whole secondary story is very endearing and alot of the credit goes to young Eliza Bennett who is one cracker of an actor.She really brought a vulnerability and believability to the part which greatly enhanced the entire film.Also on board are actors Ralph Brown and Charles Dance,who are fabulous in their respective parts.I last saw these two working together in Aliens 3.Honourable mention also goes out to the editors who did a bang up job of visibly moving the film along when it needed to.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r 1 :85:1 and is clear and crisp.The only extra is a featurette on the film.All in all a nice action/drama of covert ops gone wrong and the endearing friendship that develops between a young girl and the man under fire.Recommended.",4,A surprisingly

1071593,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000PISZ7M,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","If you're looking for an action film with car chases, shoot-outs and explosions, you will be disappointed with ""The Contractor,"" which looks more like an old-fashioned cat-and-mouse thriller. The new Wesley Snipes film, it seems, is a blend of ""Shooter"" and ""The Professional"" (aka ""Leon"") with less actions and emotional intensity.There is virtually nothing new about the story. Wesley Snipes plays James Dial, a retired sniper who is called in to do another job for men in suit. Of course, he is reluctant, accepts the job anyway and completes the mission, but not in the way he first expected and James must survive and fight back on his own as a stranger in London (but the film is shot in Bulgaria).This stoic hitman is unexpectedly helped by a lonely, troubled 14-year-old girl Emily he encounters while hiding from his enemies. This is the most memorable part of the film because of the presence of Eliza Bennett (""Nanny McPhee""). You don't find the chemistry between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman here, but their acting is surprisingly good, making their unlikely friendship pretty convincing.[NICE SUPPORTING CAST] In fact, the supporting actors are one of the merits of watching ""The Contractor,"" of which cast includes, besides Eliza Bennett, veterans like Charles Dance, John Standing and Gemma Jones, plus Lena Headey (Queen Gorgo of ""300"") as Inspector Ballard.In spite of their names, however, action scenes need more originality and tension and I don't think the hectic camera work really helps. Moreover, Dance and Headey are sadly wasted, especially the latter, having not much to do in the film's by-the-numbers story. The film is better than you may think, certainly better than most of Snipe's previous direct-to-DVD films, but not much improvement either.",2,"Nice Supporting Cast, OK Actions and Unoriginal Story",1191196800,"10 1, 2007",2007,1777,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'action', 'film', 'car', 'chases', 'shoot-outs', 'explosions', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Contractor', 'more', 'old-fashioned', 'cat-and-mouse', 'thriller', 'new', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'film', 'blend', 'Shooter', 'Professional', 'Leon', 'less', 'actions', 'emotional', 'intensity.There', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'new', 'story', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'James', 'Dial', 'retired', 'sniper', 'who', 'called', 'do', 'job', 'men', 'suit', 'course', 'reluctant', 'job', 'anyway', 'mission', 'not', 'way', 'first', 'expected', 'James', 'must', 'survive', 'fight', 'back', 'own', 'stranger', 'London', 'film', 'shot', 'Bulgaria', '.This', 'stoic', 'hitman', 'unexpectedly', 'helped', 'lonely', 'troubled', '14-year-old', 'girl', 'Emily', 'hiding', 'enemies', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'film', 'presence', 'Eliza', 'Bennett', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'chemistry', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'here', 'acting', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'making', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'pretty', 'convincing', '[', 'NICE', 'SUPPORTING', 'CAST', ']', 'fact', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'one', 'merits', 'watching', 'Contractor', 'cast', 'Eliza', 'Bennett', 'veterans', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'John', 'Standing', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'Queen', 'Gorgo', '300', 'Inspector', 'Ballard.In', 'spite', 'names', 'however', 'action', 'scenes', 'need', 'more', 'originality', 'tension', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'hectic', 'camera', 'work', 'really', 'Moreover', 'Dance', 'Headey', 'are', 'sadly', 'wasted', 'especially', 'latter', 'having', 'not', 'much', 'do', 'film', 'by-the-numbers', 'story', 'film', 'better', 'may', 'think', 'certainly', 'better', 'most', 'Snipe', 'previous', 'direct-to-DVD', 'films', 'not', 'much', 'improvement', 'either']",The Contractor

However, the trouble is that you cannot really fathom out the plot because of the sound track which seems to find a new, loud and inappropriate sound every 15 seconds. So whilst I agree with the other reviewer about the camera shots, it is the abysmal sound track that repels me. However, this film is one in a long series of new movies that look appealing but are totally destroyed by over zealous sound engineers. It has come to the point where I will not purchase any new DVDs because of it - just revert to the old classics. It is such a pity because some of them are reasonable (e.g. the Shooter) but I want to watch a film; not be constantly distracted and irritated. Have they never heard of the suspension of disbelief?
