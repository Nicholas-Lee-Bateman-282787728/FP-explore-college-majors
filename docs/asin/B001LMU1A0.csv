Now it's up to Maggie to clear the way for her future and those of her sisters, and she's definitely up to the job!This is a great movie, with a lot of fun and adventure. The actors do a great job of bringing life to the characters, making them seem as real as real can be, and keeping the story moving and fun throughout.

He's a bit of a Scrooge, preferring that his daughters suffer as old maids than he provide a dowry for them.His oldest daughter, Maggie, a matron in her late 30s or early 40s, decides to take on this situation head on and make a change. She picks out her father's best worker, a bachelor of about her own age, and suddenly announces to him that they will be married.The story of their unusual courtship, and Willie's (the renowned John Mills) personal growth from an excellent but timid craftsman to a confident and successful businessman - under Maggie's tutelage - provide the meat for the rest of the film. Charles Laughton is excellent as her grouse of a father. Brenda de Banzie, with a less recognizable name to the average movie fan, but a solid body of work herself, is wonderful as Maggie.""Hobson's Choice"" is an amusing story of the triumph of spunk.

1215182,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B001LMU1A0,C. O. DeRiemer,"[79, 84]","For those who didn't know, and I was one of them, a Hobson's choice is a free choice, but where only one option is really available. At the end of Hobson's Choice, a fine, vulgar, poignant and very funny film directed by David Lean, this is what Henry Horatio Hobson faces. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed.Hobson (Charles Laughton) is a prosperous shoe and boot merchant in the small town of Salford, England. The time is the 1880s. Hobson is a widower, a blusterer, a man accustomed to his comforts, his drink and his ease. He is, thanks to Laughton, larger than life, a man we can laugh at but not a man we'd probably want as a neighbor. He has three daughters. Maggie (Brenda De Banzie) is 30. She is, says her father, ""a bit ripe"" for marriage at her age, and he plans to keep it that way. Maggie runs the store, keeps the books, sees to dinner and keeps the home above the store neat. Henry Hobson, or course, doesn't pay her wages because she is, after all, his daughter. His two younger daughters both have suitors, and that's just fine with him until he realizes he must give them dowries if they are to marry. There'll be no dowries from Henry Hobson.And now we watch Maggie come into her own. She is a plain woman with an iron will, a determination that recognizes no barriers, and a very shrewd mind. If she is ever to get away from her father, she will have to find a man to marry her. And now we meet Willie Mossop (John Mills), the shoe worker who makes the shoes in the dingy basement under the store. Willie is just about illiterate, shy to a fault, naive, slow, honest and with very dirty hands. He is quite satisfied to stay in the basement making shoes. In Willie Mossop, however, Maggie sees not just escape from her father, but a man who makes marvelous shoes, and a man she could make into a success with his own...their own...shop. She knows she can do this, and she'll find a way to secure dowries from their father for her two sisters while she's at it. It should come as no surprise that Maggie accomplishes all she sets out to do; that Willie becomes William Mossop whose shoes sell, who is endearing and honest and who has a far better haircut after Maggie takes charge. While Henry Hobson roars about, deep in the drink, full of self-pity and bluster (and as entertaining as only Charles Laughton could make him), we settle back and enjoy the sight of Maggie using her head, with energy and determination, to get the better of her old rogue of a father. Maggie not only finds Willie, but love, too. By the end of the movie, we've come to know a contented and successful couple. William and Maggie have given Henry Hobson a choice he would be foolish to refuse.This is a vastly entertaining and satisfying movie, thanks to Lean, Laughton, Mills and, especially De Banzie. Laughton came to loath De Banzie during the filming, and the reason is as plain as De Banzie's plain but attractive face. The movie ostensibly is a showcase for Laughton. He plays Hobson bolder than life, vulgar, squinting, staggering drunk, too smart for his own good...a man full of faults and foibles we can laugh at more readily than laugh with. He has two major bits playing the drunk or hungover Hobson and he's very good. There are two major sly and finagling scenes with him which are even better. But Brenda De Banzie, a marvelous actor, steals the show. Just as Maggie carries the day, it is De Banzie who carries the movie. Laughton must have realized this would happen during their first scenes together. De Banzie starts by giving us a no-nonsense woman who knows how to get things done. Her decision to make Willie Mossop her man, to marry him, slowly lets us see just a little vulnerability. She's not going to take ""no"" from Willie, she will make him a success, but we begin to realize without her saying a word that she wants Willie to not find her unattractive. Their wedding night and the morning after is played for smiles, but they're tender smiles. We realize that Maggie made a good choice in Willie and that Willie realizes just how lucky he was. Henry Hobson may continue to bluster, enjoy his drink, expect his comforts and make us appreciate Laughton's bits of over-acting, but it is Maggie and William we feel good about. Together, they're going to be running things...and successfully, too.The movie was released long ago on VHS tape and can still be tracked down. Criterion's DVD release, due in a couple of months, will undoubtedly give the movie the attention it deserves. I plan to buy it as soon as it's out and will add here my opinion of the extras. This is one of David Lean's finest films. Hopefully, the Criterion release also will bring more attention to what a fine actor Brenda De Banzie was.",5,"David Lean, Charles Laughton, John Mills and, especially, Brenda De Banzie, make a film worth every penny of Criterion's price",1228089600,"12 1, 2008",2008,4754,"['who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'one', 'Hobson', 'choice', 'free', 'choice', 'where', 'only', 'one', 'option', 'really', 'available', 'end', 'Hobson', 'Choice', 'fine', 'vulgar', 'poignant', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'directed', 'David', 'Lean', 'what', 'Henry', 'Horatio', 'Hobson', 'Please', 'note', 'elements', 'plot', 'are', 'discussed.Hobson', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'prosperous', 'shoe', 'boot', 'merchant', 'small', 'town', 'Salford', 'England', 'time', '1880s', 'Hobson', 'widower', 'blusterer', 'man', 'accustomed', 'comforts', 'drink', 'ease', 'thanks', 'Laughton', 'larger', 'life', 'man', 'can', 'laugh', 'not', 'man', ""'d"", 'probably', 'want', 'neighbor', 'three', 'daughters', 'Maggie', 'Brenda', 'De', 'Banzie', '30', 'father', 'bit', 'ripe', 'marriage', 'age', 'keep', 'way', 'Maggie', 'store', 'books', 'dinner', 'keeps', 'home', 'store', 'neat', 'Henry', 'Hobson', 'course', ""n't"", 'pay', 'wages', 'daughter', 'two', 'younger', 'daughters', 'have', 'suitors', 'just', 'fine', 'must', 'give', 'dowries', 'are', 'marry', ""'ll"", 'be', 'dowries', 'Henry', 'Hobson.And', 'now', 'watch', 'Maggie', 'come', 'own', 'plain', 'woman', 'iron', 'will', 'determination', 'barriers', 'very', 'shrewd', 'mind', 'ever', 'get', 'away', 'father', 'will', 'have', 'find', 'man', 'marry', 'now', 'meet', 'Willie', 'Mossop', 'John', 'Mills', 'shoe', 'worker', 'who', 'shoes', 'dingy', 'basement', 'store', 'Willie', 'just', 'about', 'illiterate', 'shy', 'fault', 'naive', 'slow', 'honest', 'very', 'dirty', 'hands', 'quite', 'satisfied', 'stay', 'basement', 'making', 'shoes', 'Willie', 'Mossop', 'however', 'Maggie', 'not', 'just', 'escape', 'father', 'man', 'who', 'marvelous', 'shoes', 'man', 'could', 'make', 'success', 'own', 'own', 'shop', 'can', 'do', ""'ll"", 'find', 'way', 'secure', 'dowries', 'father', 'two', 'sisters', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'Maggie', 'out', 'do', 'Willie', 'William', 'Mossop', 'shoes', 'sell', 'who', 'endearing', 'honest', 'who', 'far', 'better', 'haircut', 'Maggie', 'charge', 'Henry', 'Hobson', 'deep', 'drink', 'full', 'self-pity', 'bluster', 'as', 'entertaining', 'only', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'could', 'make', 'settle', 'back', 'enjoy', 'sight', 'Maggie', 'using', 'head', 'energy', 'determination', 'get', 'better', 'old', 'rogue', 'father', 'Maggie', 'not', 'only', 'Willie', 'love', 'too', 'end', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'contented', 'successful', 'couple', 'William', 'Maggie', 'have', 'given', 'Henry', 'Hobson', 'choice', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'refuse.This', 'vastly', 'entertaining', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'thanks', 'Lean', 'Laughton', 'Mills', 'especially', 'De', 'Banzie', 'Laughton', 'came', 'loath', 'De', 'Banzie', 'filming', 'reason', 'as', 'plain', 'De', 'Banzie', 'plain', 'attractive', 'face', 'movie', 'ostensibly', 'showcase', 'Laughton', 'Hobson', 'bolder', 'life', 'vulgar', 'squinting', 'staggering', 'drunk', 'too', 'smart', 'own', 'good', 'man', 'full', 'faults', 'foibles', 'can', 'laugh', 'more', 'readily', 'laugh', 'two', 'major', 'bits', 'playing', 'drunk', 'hungover', 'Hobson', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'sly', 'finagling', 'scenes', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'Brenda', 'De', 'Banzie', 'marvelous', 'actor', 'show', 'Just', 'Maggie', 'day', 'De', 'Banzie', 'who', 'movie', 'Laughton', 'must', 'have', 'realized', 'would', 'happen', 'first', 'scenes', 'together', 'De', 'Banzie', 'giving', 'no-nonsense', 'woman', 'who', 'how', 'get', 'things', 'done', 'decision', 'make', 'Willie', 'Mossop', 'man', 'marry', 'slowly', 'see', 'just', 'little', 'vulnerability', 'not', 'going', 'take', 'Willie', 'will', 'make', 'success', 'begin', 'realize', 'saying', 'word', 'Willie', 'not', 'find', 'unattractive', 'wedding', 'night', 'morning', 'played', 'smiles', ""'re"", 'tender', 'smiles', 'realize', 'Maggie', 'made', 'good', 'choice', 'Willie', 'Willie', 'just', 'how', 'lucky', 'was', 'Henry', 'Hobson', 'may', 'continue', 'bluster', 'enjoy', 'drink', 'expect', 'comforts', 'make', 'appreciate', 'Laughton', 'bits', 'over-acting', 'Maggie', 'William', 'feel', 'good', 'Together', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'running', 'things', 'successfully', 'too.The', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'long', 'ago', 'VHS', 'tape', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'tracked', 'down', 'Criterion', 'DVD', 'release', 'due', 'couple', 'months', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'give', 'movie', 'attention', 'plan', 'buy', 'as', 'soon', 'out', 'will', 'add', 'here', 'opinion', 'extras', 'one', 'David', 'Lean', 'finest', 'films', 'Hopefully', 'Criterion', 'release', 'also', 'will', 'bring', 'more', 'attention', 'what', 'fine', 'actor', 'Brenda', 'De', 'Banzie', 'was']",N/A

It has quickly become a favorite and classic for me.  Not considering Charles Laughton good viewing for obvious reasons, it's a long shot I would have found this.  So glad I tried it.  It is wonderfully well done, having expertise in every category.Laughton and the oldest  daughter actress were said to have a rivalry from Laughton's viewpoint.  She was so good in this that he began to feel a bit edged out.  Perhaps Ms. de Banzie mirrored her character off camera as well as on, or just professional insecurity on his part.  However, in the film arena, she was a sympathetic and beneficial managing female.Talk about a girl's gotta' do what she's gotta' do.  Dear papa just wrote her off the marriage market and arbitrarily planned husbands for the two younger sisters.  Never mind their considerations for their own lives, you know.  This is especially rueful to the younger girls as they have two serious suitors secretly in the wings.  The arrangement was to ensure his comfort by having Maggi around to tend to things and acquiring sons-in-laws to take the younger ones off his hands and support.  He is such a brat.The plot commences to thicken as he finds out from his cronies that he is expected to provide marriage settlements (dowries) for each of them.  Now, the decree changes to enforced spinsterhood, as it seems assured that no way will he unbend and it was unlikely in the day for betrothals to come about without the requisite settlements.But, not to worry, big sister to the rescue.

1215184,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B001LMU1A0,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[5, 8]","Having grown up on the more well known films of David Lean, from his 1940s period pieces, like Great Expectations and Oliver Twist, to his famed epics, The Bridge On The River Kwai, Lawrence Of Arabia, and Dr. Zhivago, I was surprised to learn that he even made comedies. In fact, he only made two, 1945's Blithe Spirit, based on a Noel Coward play, and the film under review, 1954's Hobson's Choice (Lean's last black and white film), also based upon a play- a 1916 play of the same title by Harold Brighouse. While this film is not in a league with the aforementioned classics, it is a very good film, and often quite humorous; yet this is all due to Lean's direction and trimming away of some of the narrative fat from the play in favor of unique cinematic expression, starting from the opening shots that define the workplace of Henry Hobson (Charles Laughton, in one of his better late roles, after his career started a long, slow fade) to the many precise positionings of characters within the film frame, to the degree that many scenes play out as living detailed paintings from the very era the film is set in- the late 19th Century. One particularly well wrought scene comes near the film's end when Hobson's oldest daughter confers with a doctor about her father's condition, and instead of the camera following them for what will be a perfunctory exchange it stays with Laughton, who gives a bravura scene of underacted rage and calm in one.Hobson's Choice is not a highly regarded film in Lean's canon, and in comparison to some of the aforementioned classics, the reason why is obvious- it's only a very good film in a career littered with great works. But, it was recognized by the critics of the time, and won the 1954 Best Film Award from the British Academy of Film. The only negative in the film is the over the top burlesque music of Malcolm Arnold. Yes, the film is a comedy, but it's nowhere near slapstick. That said, it is also an enjoyable film, and dominated by the female presence in the film, a rarity in Lean's canon. A good film, an excellent ensemble of DVD features, and this bit of minor English film history becomes one of the better DVD releases in recent years. See for yourself, as it will soon be released to the general public. Now that's a choice old Hobson could live with.",4,Good,1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,2313,"['Having', 'grown', 'up', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'films', 'David', 'Lean', '1940s', 'period', 'pieces', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'famed', 'epics', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Dr.', 'Zhivago', 'was', 'surprised', 'learn', 'even', 'made', 'comedies', 'fact', 'only', 'made', 'two', '1945', 'Blithe', 'Spirit', 'based', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'play', 'film', 'review', '1954', 'Hobson', 'Choice', 'Lean', 'last', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'also', 'based', 'play-', '1916', 'play', 'same', 'title', 'Harold', 'Brighouse', 'film', 'not', 'league', 'aforementioned', 'classics', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'often', 'quite', 'humorous', 'yet', 'due', 'Lean', 'direction', 'trimming', 'away', 'narrative', 'fat', 'play', 'favor', 'unique', 'cinematic', 'expression', 'starting', 'opening', 'shots', 'define', 'workplace', 'Henry', 'Hobson', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'one', 'better', 'late', 'roles', 'career', 'started', 'long', 'slow', 'fade', 'many', 'precise', 'positionings', 'characters', 'film', 'frame', 'degree', 'many', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'living', 'detailed', 'paintings', 'very', 'film', 'set', 'in-', 'late', '19th', 'Century', 'One', 'particularly', 'well', 'wrought', 'scene', 'film', 'end', 'when', 'Hobson', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'confers', 'doctor', 'father', 'condition', 'instead', 'camera', 'following', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'perfunctory', 'exchange', 'Laughton', 'who', 'bravura', 'scene', 'underacted', 'rage', 'calm', 'one.Hobson', 'Choice', 'not', 'highly', 'regarded', 'film', 'Lean', 'canon', 'comparison', 'aforementioned', 'classics', 'reason', 'why', 'obvious-', 'only', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'career', 'littered', 'great', 'works', 'was', 'recognized', 'critics', 'time', 'won', '1954', 'Best', 'Film', 'Award', 'British', 'Academy', 'Film', 'only', 'negative', 'film', 'top', 'burlesque', 'music', 'Malcolm', 'Arnold', 'Yes', 'film', 'comedy', 'nowhere', 'near', 'slapstick', 'said', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'dominated', 'female', 'presence', 'film', 'rarity', 'Lean', 'canon', 'good', 'film', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'DVD', 'features', 'bit', 'minor', 'English', 'film', 'history', 'one', 'better', 'DVD', 'releases', 'recent', 'years', 'See', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'released', 'general', 'public', 'Now', 'choice', 'old', 'Hobson', 'could', 'live']",N/A
1215185,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B001LMU1A0,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[1, 1]","While this isn't classified as a holiday film, it conveys a beautiful message about the power of love and how it can transform the most unlikely people and rise above the standard preconceptions people hold about them. Hobson's Choice centers around a dictatorial widower with three daughters who are edging toward spinsterdom. Hobson (Charles Laughton) plays the hard drinking father who carouses and blubbers around. His oldest daughter Maggie(Brenda de Banzie) runs the household and the business. Willie (John Mills) is Hobson's employee who has developed into a master leather worker, despite being uneducated and extremely timid. Maggie sees something in Willie beyond the superficial and loves him. She cajoles him into marriage and begins a transformation that takes Willie gradually out of his comfort zone and forces him to realize his true potential and expand himself beyond his rather limited comfort zone. As the film progresses, Hobson's other daughters find romantic interests of their own and the family reconstitutes itself as the whole dynamic changes and Hobson awkwardly and with great resistance copes with a new normal he is not exactly prepared to deal with through most of the film.This film is charming and not totally unlike the John Ford film The Quiet Man. It charmingly reveals life at the turn of the century in England and is populated with quirky characters. The oafishness of Hobson, combined with the shrewdness and fortitude of Maggie, and the quiet and hard working Willie, creates an interesting and realistic dynamic that moves the story to its satisfying ending.This is a message movie that like It's A Wonderful Life tears at the heart strings as it keeps its viewer wondering where this story is headed.This Criterion Collection DVD provides an extremely good copy of this film and rediscovers an often forgotten gem that is rarely seen .",5,Wonderful Movie With A Wonderful Message,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,1880,"[""n't"", 'classified', 'holiday', 'film', 'beautiful', 'message', 'power', 'love', 'how', 'can', 'transform', 'most', 'unlikely', 'people', 'rise', 'standard', 'preconceptions', 'people', 'hold', 'Hobson', 'Choice', 'centers', 'dictatorial', 'widower', 'three', 'daughters', 'who', 'are', 'edging', 'spinsterdom', 'Hobson', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'hard', 'drinking', 'father', 'who', 'blubbers', 'around', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Maggie', 'Brenda', 'de', 'Banzie', 'household', 'business', 'Willie', 'John', 'Mills', 'Hobson', 'employee', 'who', 'developed', 'master', 'leather', 'worker', 'being', 'uneducated', 'extremely', 'timid', 'Maggie', 'something', 'Willie', 'superficial', 'marriage', 'transformation', 'Willie', 'gradually', 'comfort', 'zone', 'forces', 'realize', 'true', 'potential', 'expand', 'rather', 'limited', 'comfort', 'zone', 'film', 'Hobson', 'other', 'daughters', 'find', 'romantic', 'interests', 'own', 'family', 'whole', 'dynamic', 'changes', 'Hobson', 'awkwardly', 'great', 'resistance', 'copes', 'new', 'normal', 'not', 'exactly', 'prepared', 'deal', 'most', 'film.This', 'film', 'charming', 'not', 'totally', 'John', 'Ford', 'film', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'charmingly', 'life', 'turn', 'century', 'England', 'populated', 'quirky', 'characters', 'oafishness', 'Hobson', 'combined', 'shrewdness', 'fortitude', 'Maggie', 'quiet', 'hard', 'working', 'Willie', 'interesting', 'realistic', 'dynamic', 'story', 'satisfying', 'ending.This', 'message', 'movie', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'tears', 'heart', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'where', 'story', 'headed.This', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'extremely', 'good', 'copy', 'film', 'rediscovers', 'often', 'forgotten', 'gem', 'rarely', 'seen']",N/A

At the moment to think about Kind hearts and cornets, The man in the white suit, Whisky galore, The Lady killers or The lavender Hill Mob, it results very hard to ignore it. These films were emblematic and every one of them carved in relief the humor was the exit door before the enormous process of moral reconstruction after the WW2. As a matter of fact, I'm certain that the corrosive Monthy Phyton team during the seventies and eighties, Bertrand Blier (Buffet froid) and the irreverent Cohen brothers during the nineties, found in these movies a lot of inspiration for their projects.Hobson is a devoted father (who knows like nobody else to share his filial love with the drink) with some flaws here and there, but he will do his best in order to make his single daughter (who is at the eve of the forties) falls in love and finally get married. But meanwhile, a funny set of hilarious events will undertake.Perhaps this movie is - essentially - the closest British Neo Realist ever filmed, combining the poverty with kind serenity and good spirits an urban fable, filled with gentle tenderness, candid humor and great doses of realism.Brenda de Banzie, Charles Laughton and John Mills are simply out of this world; everyone of them is perfect in the role.

Snyder,"[1, 1]","British Director David Lean, best known for blockbusters like Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, was about a decade into his illustrious career when he directed Hobson's Choice in 1953.  Hobson (Charles Laughton) is the proprietor of an English boot and shoe shop who leaves his eldest daughter Maggie (Brenda De Banzie) to run his business while he spends his days drinking at Moonraker's Pub.  Laughton's strong performance shows his talent for comedy, as well as a surprising physical agility that belies his age and girth.Hobson's two younger daughters may marry if they wish, but he has decreed that Maggie will remain unmarried, tending his shop and his home. The strong willed Maggie has other ideas, and finds in Hobson's prized bootsmith Will (John Mills) the perfect timid lump of clay to mold into a real man. Mills' performance as the subservient worker is a delight to behold as he hesitantly transforms under Maggie's goading and guidance into a reluctant approximation of a dominant man of business.The rambunctious musical theme that plays with the opening credits is a hint that this will be no ordinary comedy.  The three lead performers, along with an assortment of familiar British character actors in supporting roles, deliver a story that is likely to linger pleasantly in your memory for years to come.This DVD from Criterion has several special features, including a newly restored digital transfer, audio commentary on the film, an informative essay in the form of a booklet, and a BBC documentary on the life and career of Charles Laughton.",5,Hobson's Choice - A Comic Gem,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,1596,"['British', 'Director', 'David', 'Lean', 'best', 'known', 'blockbusters', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'was', 'decade', 'illustrious', 'career', 'when', 'directed', 'Hobson', 'Choice', '1953', 'Hobson', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'proprietor', 'English', 'boot', 'shoe', 'shop', 'who', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Maggie', 'Brenda', 'De', 'Banzie', 'run', 'business', 'days', 'drinking', 'Moonraker', 'Pub', 'Laughton', 'strong', 'performance', 'talent', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'surprising', 'physical', 'agility', 'age', 'girth.Hobson', 'two', 'younger', 'daughters', 'may', 'marry', 'wish', 'decreed', 'Maggie', 'will', 'remain', 'unmarried', 'tending', 'shop', 'home', 'strong', 'willed', 'Maggie', 'other', 'ideas', 'Hobson', 'prized', 'bootsmith', 'Will', 'John', 'Mills', 'perfect', 'timid', 'lump', 'clay', 'mold', 'real', 'man', 'Mills', 'performance', 'subservient', 'worker', 'delight', 'behold', 'hesitantly', 'Maggie', 'goading', 'guidance', 'reluctant', 'approximation', 'dominant', 'man', 'business.The', 'rambunctious', 'musical', 'theme', 'opening', 'credits', 'hint', 'will', 'be', 'ordinary', 'comedy', 'three', 'lead', 'performers', 'assortment', 'familiar', 'British', 'character', 'actors', 'supporting', 'roles', 'deliver', 'story', 'likely', 'linger', 'pleasantly', 'memory', 'years', 'come.This', 'DVD', 'Criterion', 'several', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'newly', 'restored', 'digital', 'transfer', 'audio', 'commentary', 'film', 'informative', 'essay', 'form', 'booklet', 'BBC', 'documentary', 'life', 'career', 'Charles', 'Laughton']",N/A

In other words it is no choice at all. How Hobson's eldest daughter takes advantage of circumstance in order to put her overbearing, alcoholic father in this position is fascinating to watch. There is no situation Miss Hobson can't handle with decisiveness and dispatch. She is her  father's daughter and has a great head for business. Dad has met his match.The great Charles Laughton has a flair for humorous depiction and his comedic timing is perfect as the bootmaker who underestimates his eldest because she is a useless girl. Brenda De Banzie gives a nifty performance as the eldest daughter. She has to manage a somewhat mean-spirited, stingy, father who likes the drink too  much, as well as her sneering younger  sisters who think she is over-the-hill and beyond the age to attract a good husband. Although she is uber competent, it turns out that she is warm and inviting as well. Prunella Scales shows her comedic skill in this early portrayal (she is best known as Sybil Faulty from the hilarious ""Faulty Towers."") as the youngest Hobson daughter who is selfish, vixenish, and calculating. John Mills is really splendid as the illiterate, humble, sweet and expert bootmaker who Miss Hobson decides to make into her father's chief professional rival. The rest of the cast never misses the mark. My personal favorites are the Figgins with whom John Mills boards. In fact we can never picture any  other actors as the battling Hobsons and their friends and neighbors.All works out as it should in the end, resulting in a satisfying film experience.

1215197,A106016KSI0YQ,B001LMU1A0,Jay Dickson,"[4, 5]","During his entire career David Lean was fascinated by Victorian and Edwardian hypocrisy; this lovely little comic film from 1954, based on a 1916 Harold Brighouse play that had been filmed several times before, allowed him to show the lighter side of this fascination. Charles Laughton, in a great comic turn, plays Henry Horatio Hobson, a Salford middle-class bootmaker who drinks too much and who exploits his three daughters for their unpaid labor. The eldest daughter, Maggie (Brenda de Banzie), decides at the play's beginning to break free from her father's control by marrying his most talented workman (John Mills) despite their class differences and setting up shop together; the pleasure of the narrative is in seeing the confident, unyielding Maggie put everything to rights with her backwards lover (who initially acts as if he's been descended upon by a divine power beyond his ken), her father, and her silly sisters who have romantic interests of their own. (This is the same sort of pleasure as afforded by Stella Gibbons's novel COLD COMFORT FARM--seeing social disorder swept up and made tidy.) Though the acting styles of the film's principal actors are very different, Mills and Laughton have a great time with their more broadly etched characters and show their skills at playing broadly without going over the top; meanwhile, De Banzie has a genuine triumph of naturalistic acting with the single-minded Maggie, who is simultaneously estimable and fearsome but also quite warm and likable.

A particularly memorable scene is breakfast after the couples wedding night when Maggie has become docile and gives Will an adoring look and he seems ready to burst with pride at having performed his husbandly duties properly!

As others have mentioned, a ""Hobson's choice"" is a choice that isn't a choice at all - at least, no more than a ""take it or leave it.""In the 1890s in Salford, Lancashire, England, the owner of the boot shop is a selfish, querulous, chauvinistic alcoholic who is overbearing with his friends, his neighbors, and especially his three resentful daughters.  When he realizes he can't marry them off without providing dowries, he decrees that they will remain unmarried and work for him - without pay.  The two younger sisters, petty and self-centered, only whine about their fate. However, the eldest - dismissed as an old maid useful only as a shop manager - takes charge of her life by picking a most unlikely husband for herself:  her father's employee, Will Mossop.  Willie is painfully shy, almost completely ignorant, and possesses possibly the worst haircut in all filmdom, but Maggie has as high a respect for his superb shoemaking as he has for her managerial ability.  When it's all done, her sisters are married to the men of their choice, Maggie and Will Mossop see success in business and in marriage, and Hobbes is reduced to being a silent partner in his own shop because he is incapable of being anything else.The legendary Charles Laughton is an admirable tyrant.  His character's alcoholism would be treated much more seriously today; here he is made a comic character whose delirium tremens is funny.  But my favorite part of the tale is the development of the relationship between the ""old maid"" Maggie (Brenda De Banzie) and the mousy Mossop (John Mills).  He blossoms into a real person with the support and direction of the strong-willed, practical woman, and she softens with the love, loyalty and respect of the gentle man whose character is just the opposite of her father's.This isn't a major film, but it is a small jewel.

1215214,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B001LMU1A0,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 11]","""Hobson's Choice,"" (1954), a classic British comedy, product of Shepperton Studios, runs a brisk 107 minutes in black and white. This feel-good domestic comedy was directed by the great multi-Oscar winning David Lean.  Boozy widower Henry Horatio Hobson (Charles Laughton--The Private Life of Henry VIII [1933]) runs a successful boot shop in Salford, Lancashire, in 19th century Victorian England. Hobson is much too fond of The Moonraker, the pub across the way, forcefully dominates his employees and his three unruly daughters.  After he decrees `no marriages' to avoid the expensive matter of settlements,  the bootmaker's eldest, Maggie (Brenda De Banzie), and his star assistant Willie Mossop, marry and establish a rival business. (In his portray of Mossop, John Mills --Dunkirk, who generally played heroes in his long career, seems to be giving us an early take on his several later portrayals of village idiots).  At any rate, after her own marriage, Maggie turns her attention to helping her sisters marry their chosen suitors; Hobson is gradually forced to change his autocratic ways. The film also gives us Prunella Scales as Hobson's youngest, Vickie. (She was, of course, to win everlasting popularity later on, as Mrs. Sybil Fawlty, in John Cleese'sFawlty Towers: The Complete Collection Remastered.  Remember, ""Oh, I know, I know."" At any rate, HOBSON, an understated, witty motion picture, won the  Best Film British Academy Award.Salford, an ancient, historic city, has, since Victorian times, been absorbed into Greater Manchester. But Lean gives us a good rendition of the city, its people, and its pulses at the time.  The film, to be sure, comes relatively early in the British director's career.  It follows on some of his noted black and white films, MADELEINE, OLIVER TWIST, GREAT EXPECTATIONS, BRIEF ENCOUNTER, BLITHE SPIRIT and the World War II pictures THIS HAPPY BREED and IN WHICH WE SERVE.  Later in his career, of course, Lean was to begin making the big-canvas full-color Oscar-winning pictures on which his reputation largely rests today:Lawrence of Arabia (Single Disc Edition)(1962),The Bridge on the River Kwai, (1957),A Passage to India [Blu-ray] (1984),Doctor Zhivago(1965).  AndRyan's Daughter (Two-Disc Special Edition), one of John Mills' finest village idiot portrayals within.Current-day audiences might not find Hobson's drunken antics, nor his delirium tremens, as hilarious as 1954 audiences were meant to.  We might be puzzled by an extensive scene in which the drunken Hobson chases the reflected moon in various puddles in the street--and what was that all about, I still wonder?  Just director Lean playing with his nifty camera?  But we might be inclined to stand up and cheer as Maggie, at 30 already considered a spinster, decides to marry Willie, and gets it done, despite all opposition, even from Willie.  She helps him carve out a successful career, too.  Well, aside from Hobson's drunken moments, the film is easy enough to take, and can be quite entertaining.  It's worth a butcher's -- a look.",3,Easy Enough to Take; Can Be Entertaining,1309737600,"07 4, 2011",2011,3057,"['Hobson', 'Choice', '1954', 'classic', 'British', 'comedy', 'product', 'Shepperton', 'Studios', 'brisk', '107', 'minutes', 'black', 'white', 'feel-good', 'domestic', 'comedy', 'was', 'directed', 'great', 'multi-Oscar', 'winning', 'David', 'Lean', 'Boozy', 'widower', 'Henry', 'Horatio', 'Hobson', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Private', 'Life', 'Henry', 'VIII', '[', '1933', ']', 'successful', 'boot', 'shop', 'Salford', 'Lancashire', '19th', 'century', 'Victorian', 'England', 'Hobson', 'much', 'too', 'fond', 'Moonraker', 'pub', 'way', 'forcefully', 'employees', 'three', 'unruly', 'daughters', 'marriages', 'avoid', 'expensive', 'matter', 'settlements', 'bootmaker', 'eldest', 'Maggie', 'Brenda', 'De', 'Banzie', 'star', 'assistant', 'Willie', 'Mossop', 'marry', 'establish', 'rival', 'business', 'portray', 'Mossop', 'John', 'Mills', 'Dunkirk', 'who', 'generally', 'played', 'heroes', 'long', 'career', 'be', 'giving', 'early', 'take', 'several', 'later', 'portrayals', 'village', 'idiots', 'rate', 'own', 'marriage', 'Maggie', 'attention', 'helping', 'sisters', 'marry', 'chosen', 'suitors', 'Hobson', 'gradually', 'forced', 'change', 'autocratic', 'ways', 'film', 'also', 'Prunella', 'Scales', 'Hobson', 'youngest', 'Vickie', 'was', 'course', 'win', 'everlasting', 'popularity', 'later', 'Mrs.', 'Sybil', 'Fawlty', 'John', ""Cleese'sFawlty"", 'Towers', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'Remastered', 'Remember', 'Oh', 'know', 'know', 'rate', 'HOBSON', 'understated', 'witty', 'motion', 'picture', 'won', 'Best', 'Film', 'British', 'Academy', 'Award.Salford', 'ancient', 'historic', 'city', 'Victorian', 'times', 'been', 'absorbed', 'Greater', 'Manchester', 'Lean', 'good', 'rendition', 'city', 'people', 'pulses', 'time', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'relatively', 'early', 'British', 'director', 'career', 'noted', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'MADELEINE', 'OLIVER', 'TWIST', 'GREAT', 'EXPECTATIONS', 'BRIEF', 'ENCOUNTER', 'BLITHE', 'SPIRIT', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'THIS', 'HAPPY', 'BREED', 'IN', 'WHICH', 'WE', 'SERVE', 'Later', 'career', 'course', 'Lean', 'was', 'begin', 'making', 'big-canvas', 'full-color', 'Oscar-winning', 'pictures', 'reputation', 'largely', 'today', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Single', 'Disc', 'Edition', '1962', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', '1957', 'Passage', 'India', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', '1984', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', '1965', 'AndRyan', 'Daughter', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'one', 'John', 'Mills', 'finest', 'village', 'idiot', 'portrayals', 'within.Current-day', 'audiences', 'might', 'not', 'find', 'Hobson', 'drunken', 'antics', 'delirium', 'tremens', 'as', 'hilarious', '1954', 'audiences', 'were', 'meant', 'might', 'be', 'puzzled', 'extensive', 'scene', 'drunken', 'Hobson', 'reflected', 'moon', 'various', 'puddles', 'street', 'what', 'was', 'still', 'wonder', 'Just', 'director', 'Lean', 'playing', 'nifty', 'camera', 'might', 'be', 'inclined', 'stand', 'up', 'cheer', 'Maggie', '30', 'already', 'considered', 'spinster', 'marry', 'Willie', 'done', 'opposition', 'even', 'Willie', 'carve', 'out', 'successful', 'career', 'too', 'Well', 'aside', 'Hobson', 'drunken', 'moments', 'film', 'easy', 'enough', 'take', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'butcher', 'look']",N/A
