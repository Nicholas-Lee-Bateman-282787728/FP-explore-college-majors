1383449,A2VMT89TCSF105,B0042PPTAA,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[2, 9]","""Zeitgeist: The Movie"" was a sensation on the web five years ago, but (of course!) I missed all the fun. The film, made by Peter Joseph, is an eclectic rehash of various conspiracy theories. Or alternative worldviews, if you're more appreciative.Often, the message sounds suspiciously similar to that of the John Birch Society: the Federal Reserve is a conspiracy, the Federal Income Tax is illegal, our money are debt-based fiat currency not backed by gold, the U.S. should have stayed out of both world wars and the Vietnam war, LBJ colluded with the Russians and VC's, public schools make students dumber and are probably a conspiracy as well, the U.S. elite wants a One World Government, etc.A very different kind of conspiracy theorist, Lyndon LaRouche, is briefly featured. A whole section of ""Zeitgeist"" is devoted to the claims of the politically amorphous Truth Movement. Our old friend David Ray Griffin is shown. Curiously, the film starts with an extended attack on Christianity, an attack based on the ideas of Acharya S, Gerald Massey and Jordan Maxwell. Peter Joseph believes that Christianity is a fraud, separating man from the world, thereby serving the establishment and being the psychological soil for other (secular) myths.But what is the point of the exercise? It turns out that Joseph is the leader of a group called the Zeitgeist Movement, which calls for international communism! According to Wikipedia ""The Zeitgeist Movement is a global nonprofit organization founded in 2008. It advocates the abolition of money and private property and promotes a global socioeconomic system in which all resources would be equally shared. According to the movement, such a system would increase social equality and sustainability. The Zeitgeist Movement also believes resource allocation can be managed by computerized systems and most manual labor can be fully automated"".But why would such a group be so heavily dependent on right-wing conspiracy theory (or right-wing truths, if you're a conservative libertarian)? For instance, why would a left-wing group criticize FDR or the abolition of the gold standard, claim that LBJ colluded with the reds, and criticize public schools, not just for educational failure, but for simply being public?My guess is that ""Zeitgeist: The Movie"" is deliberately eclectic, since its intended audience consists of young, politically raw seekers who treat all ""alternative"" and ""anti-establishment"" sources as equally interesting or veracious. Hence the attempts to combine ideas which are really incompatible - 20 or 30 years ago, a film like ""Zeitgeist"" would have been roundly condemned as ""fascist"", and that would have been the end of it. Today, this potpourri of conspiracy theories, or at the very least widely divergent alternative ideas, becomes an instant viral hit.Well, I suppose that *is* the spirit of the times...""Zeitgeist"" does have obvious similarities with Foster Gamble's ""Thrive"". Indeed, ""Thrive"" might have been inspired by the success surrounding the earlier film. Gamble attempts to combine libertarianism with left-liberalism, and has said that he would like to see Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinic as running mates for the presidency! However, ""Thrive"" is at bottom somewhat less eclectic than ""Zeitgeist"", perhaps because Gamble is more consistently libertarian. It's also more overtly spiritual than ""Zeitgeist"", which sounds non-religious or even anti-religious, despite featuring the Buddhist teacher Ch&ouml;gyam Trungpa Rinpoche.I award ""Zeitgeist: The Movie"" two stars. It's not bad as a film production. But no, this is not really my cup of tea. Nor, apparently, my zeitgeist.",2,An eclectic zeitgeist,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,3655,"['Zeitgeist', 'Movie', 'was', 'sensation', 'web', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'course', 'missed', 'fun', 'film', 'made', 'Peter', 'Joseph', 'eclectic', 'rehash', 'various', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'alternative', 'worldviews', ""'re"", 'more', 'appreciative.Often', 'message', 'suspiciously', 'similar', 'John', 'Birch', 'Society', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'conspiracy', 'Federal', 'Income', 'Tax', 'illegal', 'money', 'are', 'debt-based', 'fiat', 'currency', 'not', 'backed', 'gold', 'U.S.', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'world', 'wars', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'LBJ', 'colluded', 'Russians', 'VC', 'public', 'schools', 'make', 'students', 'dumber', 'are', 'probably', 'conspiracy', 'as', 'well', 'U.S.', 'elite', 'One', 'World', 'Government', 'etc.A', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'Lyndon', 'LaRouche', 'briefly', 'featured', 'whole', 'section', 'Zeitgeist', 'devoted', 'claims', 'politically', 'amorphous', 'Truth', 'Movement', 'old', 'friend', 'David', 'Ray', 'Griffin', 'shown', 'Curiously', 'film', 'extended', 'attack', 'Christianity', 'attack', 'based', 'ideas', 'Acharya', 'S', 'Gerald', 'Massey', 'Jordan', 'Maxwell', 'Peter', 'Joseph', 'Christianity', 'fraud', 'separating', 'man', 'world', 'thereby', 'serving', 'establishment', 'being', 'psychological', 'soil', 'other', 'secular', 'myths.But', 'what', 'point', 'exercise', 'out', 'Joseph', 'leader', 'group', 'called', 'Zeitgeist', 'Movement', 'international', 'communism', 'According', 'Wikipedia', 'Zeitgeist', 'Movement', 'global', 'nonprofit', 'organization', 'founded', '2008', 'abolition', 'money', 'private', 'property', 'global', 'socioeconomic', 'system', 'resources', 'would', 'be', 'equally', 'shared', 'According', 'movement', 'system', 'would', 'increase', 'social', 'equality', 'sustainability', 'Zeitgeist', 'Movement', 'also', 'resource', 'allocation', 'can', 'be', 'managed', 'computerized', 'systems', 'most', 'manual', 'labor', 'can', 'be', 'fully', 'automated', '.But', 'why', 'would', 'such', 'group', 'be', 'so', 'heavily', 'dependent', 'right-wing', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'right-wing', 'truths', ""'re"", 'conservative', 'libertarian', 'instance', 'why', 'would', 'left-wing', 'group', 'criticize', 'FDR', 'abolition', 'gold', 'standard', 'claim', 'LBJ', 'colluded', 'reds', 'criticize', 'public', 'schools', 'not', 'just', 'educational', 'failure', 'simply', 'being', 'public', 'guess', 'Zeitgeist', 'Movie', 'deliberately', 'eclectic', 'intended', 'audience', 'young', 'politically', 'raw', 'seekers', 'who', 'treat', 'alternative', 'anti-establishment', 'sources', 'equally', 'interesting', 'veracious', 'Hence', 'attempts', 'combine', 'ideas', 'are', 'really', 'incompatible', '20', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'Zeitgeist', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'roundly', 'condemned', 'fascist', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'Today', 'potpourri', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'very', 'least', 'widely', 'divergent', 'alternative', 'ideas', 'instant', 'viral', 'hit.Well', 'suppose', 'spirit', 'times', 'Zeitgeist', 'have', 'obvious', 'similarities', 'Foster', 'Gamble', 'Thrive', 'Indeed', 'Thrive', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'success', 'surrounding', 'earlier', 'film', 'Gamble', 'attempts', 'combine', 'libertarianism', 'left-liberalism', 'said', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Ron', 'Paul', 'Dennis', 'Kucinic', 'running', 'mates', 'presidency', 'However', 'Thrive', 'bottom', 'somewhat', 'less', 'eclectic', 'Zeitgeist', 'perhaps', 'Gamble', 'more', 'consistently', 'libertarian', 'also', 'more', 'overtly', 'spiritual', 'Zeitgeist', 'non-religious', 'even', 'anti-religious', 'featuring', 'Buddhist', 'teacher', 'Ch', 'ouml', 'Trungpa', 'Rinpoche.I', 'Zeitgeist', 'Movie', 'two', 'stars', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'production', 'not', 'really', 'cup', 'tea', 'apparently', 'zeitgeist']",N/A
1383450,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0042PPTAA,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[13, 16]","This is really three movies in one, with the three segments only rather loosely tied together under a semi-spiritual theme. If there is any one theme, it is not ""conspiracy theories,"" as many have suggested, but ""look deeper than the media does."" That, you may be sure, is not all that difficult. In fact, there are a couple of scenes copped from Network, a movie from the 1970s which I now realize I must see.Part I: The Greatest Story Ever ToldThis itemizes all the similarities between various mythologies, including the Christian mythology. I have seen these issues pointed out elsewhere, and it is basically true that mythology has many themes in common across cultural boundaries. Joseph Campbell did a somewhat more thorough job of examining this fact, but it's something of importance if you have a debate going where it is relevant. Most Christians don't care, and have stock answers for why these correspondences exist.Part 2: All the World's a StageThis examines the concept that the 9/11 Commission was basically a whitewash, and that there are many unanswered questions about exactly what happened that day, and who did it. Parallels are made to Pearl Harbor, the sinking of the Lusitania, and the Gulf of Tonkin attack. That is, that they were either contrived or at least warned of in advance, but were allowed or caused to happen for what they would do to public opinion. The general hypothesis is that the Powers That Be make money off wars, and so want wars started and continued.Part 3: Don't Mind the Men Behind the CurtainThis examines the Federal Reserve system, the IRS, and banking power brokers. It is probably the most interesting section in light of what we know now of the collapse of the banks just last fall [written in 2009]. The movie might be seen as prophetic on the basis of this portion alone.How much do I believe of all this? I'm still trying to decide. I do not accept it without question, and I don't reject it, either. I think the real point is that it is essential to look behind appearances, learn as much as you can of different points of view, and try not to be swayed by prejudice either for or against a particular group.",3,"A Documentary About Conspiracies, Sort Of",1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2168,"['really', 'three', 'movies', 'one', 'three', 'segments', 'only', 'rather', 'loosely', 'tied', 'together', 'semi-spiritual', 'theme', 'one', 'theme', 'not', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'many', 'have', 'suggested', 'look', 'deeper', 'media', 'may', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'difficult', 'fact', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'copped', 'Network', 'movie', '1970s', 'now', 'realize', 'must', 'see.Part', 'Greatest', 'Story', 'Ever', 'ToldThis', 'similarities', 'various', 'mythologies', 'including', 'Christian', 'mythology', 'have', 'seen', 'issues', 'pointed', 'out', 'elsewhere', 'basically', 'true', 'mythology', 'many', 'themes', 'common', 'cultural', 'boundaries', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'did', 'somewhat', 'more', 'thorough', 'job', 'examining', 'fact', 'something', 'importance', 'have', 'debate', 'going', 'where', 'relevant', 'Most', 'Christians', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'have', 'stock', 'answers', 'why', 'correspondences', 'exist.Part', '2', 'World', 'StageThis', 'concept', '9/11', 'Commission', 'was', 'basically', 'whitewash', 'are', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'day', 'who', 'did', 'Parallels', 'are', 'made', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'sinking', 'Lusitania', 'Gulf', 'Tonkin', 'attack', 'were', 'either', 'contrived', 'least', 'warned', 'advance', 'were', 'allowed', 'caused', 'happen', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'public', 'opinion', 'general', 'hypothesis', 'Powers', 'Be', 'make', 'money', 'wars', 'so', 'want', 'wars', 'started', 'continued.Part', '3', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Mind', 'Men', 'CurtainThis', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'system', 'IRS', 'banking', 'power', 'brokers', 'probably', 'most', 'interesting', 'section', 'light', 'what', 'know', 'now', 'collapse', 'banks', 'just', 'last', 'fall', '[', 'written', '2009', ']', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'seen', 'prophetic', 'basis', 'portion', 'alone.How', 'much', 'do', 'believe', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'decide', 'do', 'not', 'accept', 'question', 'do', ""n't"", 'reject', 'either', 'think', 'real', 'point', 'essential', 'look', 'appearances', 'learn', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'try', 'not', 'be', 'swayed', 'prejudice', 'particular', 'group']",N/A

Heavily dramatic and well structured to keep you in suspense, Zeitgeist will keep you locked in silence until the credits roll.

The Mayan zodiac consisted of 20 sings while the Babylonian had 18 signs, American Indians had different signs than the Eskimos and on and on it goes. There was no continuity of signs as the film clams.The movie also makes the egregious error of claiming the sun was the creator of all cultures. This is patently false and in fact only a few make this claim.The movie also screwed up majorily on Horus, claiming he was the god of the sun - FALSE he was the god of the sky, Ra was the god of the sun. Horus also was NOT born on December 25th, as the movie claimed he was born during epagomenal days which occur in August. His mother as also NOT a virgin, instead we know his father was Osiris. Finally the whole life-story that the narrator tells of Horus is completely made up. For just one example he claims that Horus died, was buried and resurrected three days later. That's utter BS, because Horus NEVER died, what happened to Horus was he merged with the Sun God Ra and lives eternally.But such BS gets worse, There is no record of Attis being born a virgin as the movie claims, and death and 3 day resurrection is glaringly false. Attis is the god of vegetation, and Attis departs the earth as winter comes (and the crops go dormant) and is resurrected in the spring, this is NOT three days.The claim that Krishna was a born a virgin is also 100% false - Krishna was actually the EIGHTH son of Devaki and Vasudeva and there is NO claim that Kirshna was resurrected, this is again made up BS by the author.On and on  it goesDionysus was NOT born of a virgin, again BS, his mother is Semele and his father was Zeus who had other children so again more BS about being an only son.

I take umbrage to this. We know conspiracies exist and have always existed. So thinking there is a need for this is putting the cart before the horse. If that is where the evidence leads it must be followed and weighted like any other theory. We are presented with some very good evidence here.This is done in three parts. The first deals with how the story of Jesus was old before it was attributed to Jesus. This idea is gaining serious ground. There are numerous books and documentaries extant that cover this and there is little doubt in my mind of its validity. The evidence is presented here in a clean and concise manner with information that can be readily verified. It goes on to say that the Christian religion was essentially manufactured by the Romans as a way to exert control and reap incredible amounts of money. They run through the atrocities of the church through the ages and it doesn't paint a pretty picture.The second section deals with the the attacks of 911. If you're at all familiar with the conspiracy theories behind the attacks there might not be much new here. But, again, it's presented in a clean and concise manner with numerous historical precedents. The evidence is good and, to me, undeniable.The third deals with the manipulation, over the years, of the American economy through the central banking system. This, again, isn't new, and I could have used a bit more detail here. It does present some good information with some credible witnesses in regard to things such as our income tax system. Well worth viewing.There is a short post script on our manipulation through a corrupt media. This is cautionary and needs to be taken seriously. If the TV is our life line, we need to be aware of what we're being fed.This is very good.

1383463,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B0042PPTAA,kacunnin,"[6, 10]","I had no idea what to expect when I sat down to watch ZEITGEIST: THE MOVIE.  The first part examines Christianity, ultimately concluding that the myth of Jesus Christ was created and perpetuated as a means of controlling people.  This was interesting.  The film compares Jesus's story with those of many mythological figures that predate him.  It explores the astrological connections to Jesus (is he ""son"" or ""sun,"" for example), the real significance of his December 25th birthdate, the virgin birth (think Virgo), and what is really meant by the so-called ""end of days"" (not the end of the world, but the end of one astrological era and the dawn of another . . .  ""this is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius"").I found all this fascinating (although Christians might be annoyed!).  But then we get to the rest of the film and what it's really trying to do.  The movie's thesis is that virtually all of the tragedies in history were really manipulated by a shady cabal of money-connected operatives who have been manipulating the world for the sole purpose of expanding their own personal wealth and power.  They wanted a Federal Reserve Bank, so they manipulated a financial collapse in 1907, leading to the failure of many banks and the resulting formation of the Federal Reserve, giving them virtually unlimited power over not just the American people but our government.War is the biggest money-making operation (and it also allows government to suspend civil rights), so to get us into WWI, the cabal arranged for the sinking of the Lusitania by the Germans.  To further solidify the Federal Reserve, this same cabal caused the stock market crash of 1929, which resulted in the failure of many private banks, giving the Federal Reserve even more power.  They wanted us in WWII, so they allowed the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor to happen (even though they knew in advance what the Japanese were planning).  Viet Nam was even more insidious; the cabal wanted a seemingly never-ending war that would keep them fat and happy for decades, so they set it up as a failure from the start (with ""rules of engagement"" that tied the hands of the government and the soldiers actually fighting).And they arranged for the attacks on the World Trade Center, both in 1993 (when the attack essentially failed) and in 2001 (when it totally succeeded).  The cabal also arranged the bombing of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City in 1995.  And all of it was to push us into yet another series of seemingly never-ending wars, this time against so-called ""terrorists"" in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Terrorism, the film says, was a manufactured enemy, used to frighten the American people into decades of militarism.  It also enabled the Bush administration to pass the Patriot Act and the Office of Homeland Security, both of which curtailed our rights as citizens (and both of which, says the film, were modeled on the similarly-named programs that enabled Hitler to rise to power in Germany).ZEITGEIST argues that this insidious cabal (which is never named, although there are references to the Neocons, the Bush family, Chaney, and the big bankers - Rockefeller, Astor, Guggenheim, etc.) is purposely keeping the American population stupid and complacent.  Our public education system is purposely degraded (so our children don't learn how to think critically) and our minds are numbed by a constant stream of reality TV, entertainment-based pseudo-news, and plenty of alcohol and drugs.And the ultimate goal of this cabal, says ZEITGEIST, is to implant us all with microchips which will give them constant access to our bank accounts, our whereabouts, and our private lives 24/7.Overall, ZEITGEIST is a scary film.  If even a small percentage of the insidious plots mentioned here is true, then we really have been hoodwinked.  But the problem I have with conspiracy theories (and ZEITGEIST is one doozy of a conspiracy theory) is what it would take to keep the conspiracy going.  You'd have to believe that this secret cabal (which is not just linked to the US - Great Britain is playing, too, as well as other European countries) has been operating for over a century without detection.  That's a very hard sell.ZEITGEIST is the product of something called The Zeitgeist Project, which advocates a return to a simpler way of life (one that doesn't revolve around money).  The suggestion at the end of the film is that Americans need to start thinking collectively, rather than individually.  The cabal wants us to act for our individual benefit (it's the ""divide and conquer"" rule), but if we can just see that acting together against our oppressors might actually succeed in overthrowing them (whoever they are), we might be able to change the world.  Is there truth in this?  Of course there is.  But ZEITGEIST: THE MOVIE is just as manipulative as the shadowy cabal it seeks to expose.  If you believe what ZEITGEIST is telling you, you won't feel comfortable living in this country anymore.  The problem is, if you believe what ZEITGEIST is telling you, you won't feel comfortable living anywhere anymore.  And I guess that's the point.  Watch the film - it's definitely not boring!

The one with the scary music and seemingly endless photos of corpses, bloodied screaming people and clips from Network, while an angry narrator rails against religion, government and banks? That's the one!Yes, I've seen it, and let me tell you as a critical scholar of religion (esp early Christianity) I was scribbling notes every two seconds throughout part 1. The entire ""Jesus was just a Myth"" is a fringe theory, rejected by mainstream scholarship (it's based largely on a ""copycat hypothesis"" promoted by 19th century amateurs like Kersey Graves and promoted by modern day pulp writers like ""Acharya S"" (D.M. Murdock, who is not a historian or biblical scholar). So while the first third of this ""documentary"" was a pseudo-scholarly attack on Christianity (it's all copied from astrology! that would sure be a shock to the Jesus Seminar!) and a denial of the historical existence of Jesus of Nazareth, part 2 imitates ""Loose Change"" and proclaims that 9/11 was an ""inside job"" (this conspiracy theory was debunked by Popular Mechanics, and their debate with the ""Loose Change"" kooks is available to view on youtube). Part 3 attacks the world bankers, the federal reserve, and the US government, tying together a vast world wide conspiracy that will supposedly end with microchips implanted in every person to monitor them 24/7 in the ultimate Orwellian nightmare police state.If the filmmaker's intention was to scare people, he's succeeded. Thousands of people all over the internet are now terrified that religion and the government are out to get them because of this movie. Many conspiracy nuts have had their beliefs reinforced by it. I don't know about part 3 (that's outside my area of expertise), but part 1 is unscholarly nonsense. Part 2 has been answered by a credible source. Watch it and judge for yourself.However I would leave Zeitgeist defenders with a parting thought... if the filmmaker is right, and the media, government, religion, etc all conspire to keep the masses ""in fear"" and believing what they are told, then how is the massive uncritical support of this film any different? Maybe the filmmaker was ironically trying to point out just how gullible the average American tv watcher/internet surfer is...Skip this and watch ""Network"" instead if you want a Libertarian anti-media rant that's entertaining to watch.

Although the chapter is actually very good at pointing out that organized religion and messiah figures have been used for thousands of years to control people and use excellent evidence to back this claim - and that religion on the institutionalized level is part of the ruling class pyramid - they also attempt to prove that Jesus Christ did not exist. While they do provide evidence for their claim, this should not be part of the film for many reasons 1. It alienates a large portion of a could-be audience, mainly many Christians who, because this is how the film begins, are immediately turned off, and 2. it is not necessary at all in order to make the point they are trying to make, both in this chapter and the rest of the film... in fact, the entire first chapter, though somewhat relevant, is not necessary. The film would be much better with this chapter deleted or edited to make the general point that religion has been used to control and keep masses from rebelling against tyranny for thousands of years, and while true that part of that has been done over the ages with different messiahs, there is no need to try and disprove the existence of Jesus. Furthermore, a real person, for instance, can be used falsely as a martyred messiah from God by the powers that be. Regardless of the real truth behind Jesus's existence, and his spiritual identity, it is completely unnecessary and ruins the film for many people that they could have reached and spread the important knowledge to come in the film to.Zeitgeist reveals the current 'secrets' of the world as well as history not told, aka, as William Cooper would have put it, The Secrets of the Ages, and does a brilliant job at revealing how the world really works and who is actually in power and how they operate to oppress and keep their status as rulers throughout dynasties of power, while the politicians do their biddings secretly. All of the information is well backed by research revealed in the film.

1383470,A16QGOOU3TUO5P,B0042PPTAA,Max Ley,"[3, 5]","4.7 starsThis movie analyzes three different modern day conspiracies: religion, 9/11, and the banking system. The 9/11 segment and the banking system are revolutionary topics and are 100% accurate, factual stuff. The religious section of the movie is also very interesting, but I feel like religion is something that is an individual's belief and I think the movie would be better off without it.The section on the 9/11 attacks on America is pure gold however. Very few people know the truth about what happen that day, and I'm trying to claim that I do what happened, but the facts that are presented in this movie made me start thinking that maybe there was something the media was hiding from us. The first thing that blew my mind was that three buildings fell down that day. Building number 11 wasn't ever mentioned in the news and didn't even get hit by a plane, yet for some reason, it collapsed. That in itself should make one wonder about what happened. Along with that, there are several other things discussed in this movie that raise question about that tragic day.Our banking system is a very complex system that seems to be a pyramid scheme built to create profit for the owners of the banks. As noted by this movie, the Federal Reserve in itself is unconstitutional because it is privately owned, yet somehow, is is solely responsible for printing our money. Not only that, but it taxes us on our own money. Seems a little bit corrupt if you ask me.Religion is, has been, and always will be a touchy subject. In Zeitgeist they make relationships between Christianity and astrology which have some oddly close similarities. I never made the correlations myself, but after watching the movie I was blown away by some of the coincidences between the two. Regardless of your religion, this bit on religion is very interesting and will get you thinking no doubt.I suggest that you watch this movie with an open mind then formulate your own opinions when it is over. If you don't believe a thing that they said, fine, so be it. But, if you are convinced that there is some truth to this movie your life will forever be changed and you will look at life from a different viewpoint, the informed.",4,Conspiracy theory film backed by facts,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,2202,"['4.7', 'starsThis', 'movie', 'three', 'different', 'modern', 'day', 'conspiracies', 'religion', '9/11', 'banking', 'system', '9/11', 'segment', 'banking', 'system', 'are', 'revolutionary', 'topics', 'are', '100', '%', 'accurate', 'factual', 'stuff', 'religious', 'section', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'feel', 'religion', 'something', 'individual', 'belief', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'it.The', 'section', '9/11', 'attacks', 'America', 'pure', 'gold', 'however', 'Very', 'few', 'people', 'know', 'truth', 'what', 'happen', 'day', ""'m"", 'trying', 'claim', 'do', 'what', 'happened', 'facts', 'are', 'presented', 'movie', 'made', 'start', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'was', 'something', 'media', 'was', 'hiding', 'first', 'thing', 'blew', 'mind', 'was', 'three', 'buildings', 'fell', 'down', 'day', 'Building', 'number', '11', 'was', ""n't"", 'ever', 'mentioned', 'news', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'hit', 'plane', 'yet', 'reason', 'collapsed', 'should', 'make', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'things', 'discussed', 'movie', 'raise', 'question', 'tragic', 'day.Our', 'banking', 'system', 'very', 'complex', 'system', 'be', 'pyramid', 'scheme', 'built', 'create', 'profit', 'owners', 'banks', 'noted', 'movie', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'unconstitutional', 'privately', 'owned', 'yet', 'somehow', 'solely', 'responsible', 'printing', 'money', 'Not', 'only', 'taxes', 'own', 'money', 'little', 'bit', 'corrupt', 'ask', 'me.Religion', 'been', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'touchy', 'subject', 'Zeitgeist', 'make', 'relationships', 'Christianity', 'astrology', 'have', 'oddly', 'close', 'similarities', 'never', 'made', 'correlations', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'coincidences', 'two', 'Regardless', 'religion', 'bit', 'religion', 'very', 'interesting', 'will', 'get', 'thinking', 'doubt.I', 'suggest', 'watch', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'then', 'formulate', 'own', 'opinions', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'thing', 'said', 'fine', 'so', 'be', 'are', 'convinced', 'truth', 'movie', 'life', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'changed', 'will', 'look', 'life', 'different', 'viewpoint', 'informed']",N/A

The first building was struck around the 90th floor and the second was around the 70th.  Given that the amount of jet fuel in both planes was considerable, both explosions were intense.  Building number 2 had 20 more stories of pressure on it, above the point of impact, and that is why it came down quicker than the first, period.  No government conspiracy.  Our government can't even balance it's own budget let alone engineer something of this magnitude. Not to mention the amount of collusion that it would entail.

If people won't believe in what actually starts wars, at least they know that there is such a thing as ""rules of engagement"", now why would they give the enemy an unfair advantage like that? One group that profits is the arms dealers who benefit from longer wars. How could there be anyone left that denies corruption in Washington? democrats and republicans campaigns are financially backed by none other than the big banks, oil companies, etc. after winning, more than a little ""thank you"" is required from the new president as he backs their agendas and by doing so he has been ""bought"". Around ground zero, you see buildings still standing that are burned out shells. Among them is where building 7 collapsed at free fall as if it was rigged with tnt for demolition, but was not hit by a plane! The pentagon supposedly hit by a gravity defying airplane flown by a terrorist who never even learned how to land. The evidence would have been shown by any one of over 80 online operating security cameras on the building not to mention cameras at gas stations and hotels across the street. All the footage is confiscated by the government and nothing but a few frames is ever shown (no plane just an explosion). How can anyone still believe anything the corporate owned mainstream news media says? Ron Paul was given more money from our soldiers than all the gop candidates put together including Obama! but look at how the opinionated news anchors unjustly criticized him especially considering that they could find no ""dirt"" on him. Zeitgeist covers the oppressive religions, false flag wars, the undeniable history of the federal reserve, the cult of conformity and how keeping things the same without question is our own orders of the day. Classic comments from stand up comedians Bill Hicks and George Carlin painfully remind us how we let ourselves be fooled by the powers that be.

I obtained information that the Presbyterian church taught the doctrine of predestination, which means that before you are born God decides whether you will go to heaven or hell.That doctrine was never explained to me, let alone all the pagan beliefs explained in Zeitgeist. I will not go into Zeitgeist in great depth because you can read it yourself. I will just say that I attended a religious college for a year and the examples of pagan religions were never mentioned. I did find some examples of gospels that were found in caves and were disowned by the Christian (Roman Catholic) church.Zeitgeist goes into great depth into 911. I would like to focus instead on Patricio Guzman's 4 DVD version of the Battle of Chile and other DVDs by Guzman which go into great depth on that war, including the demands by then President Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that Chile's air force murder the elected President Salvador Allende by bombing the Presidential Palace, followed by the killing of students who were buried in unmarked graves by the Chile and Argentina military. They even smuggled a gun in a diplomatic pouch which was to be used to kill Allende. Allende was accused of being a Communist, but the evidence is clear that he was a socialist. Some of you might remember news of the mothers of the disappeared students protesting on the streets of Santiago and Buenos Aires.You can follow this story in the DVD Salvador Allende, also by Guzman, and another Guzman DVD: The Pinochet Case, followed by the Guzman blu-ray Nostalgia for the Light and an excellent Roman Polanski film titled Death and the Maiden.
