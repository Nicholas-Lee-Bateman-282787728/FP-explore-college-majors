445393,A3ADA4TND5VOY6,6305051135,"Charles G. Fry ""cgfry""","[4, 5]","Wide Awake will be a very pleasant surprise for fans of Shyamalan's more recent movies; this is one of his best.  Even if you're not a Shyamalan fan, look this one up; other than a very strong story, it has no connection to Shyamalan's horror movies.  This is a funny-serious, Christian-themed family movie.  Many stereotypes about Catholic education are used, but these are done in a light-hearted manner, one might say lovingly; the positives of a Catholic education can be discerned right along with the stereotypically bad.  Religious questions are presented in ways that should not offend.Joseph Cross carries this movie in the lead as the 11 yr old Joshua, who is struggling with the passing away of his beloved grandfather.  Joshua decides to go on a mission:  being enrolled in a strict Catholic school, and having strong religious memories with his grandfather, Joshua decides he needs to talk directly with God about his grandfather's passing.  The mission is to figure out how to get God to agree to this.  Not surprisingly, Shyamalan's story is very strong.  More surprising are the many funny scenes involving school hi-jinks, along the lines of many lesser kids' movies.  Shyamalan smartly keeps these under control; they are not overdone or screechy, and not surprisingly, are a lot more fun and memorable than the usual fare.  These are mixed in with many serious scenes that carry meaning for young and old alike.Although Cross and the story carry the movie, they are buttressed by many other fine performances.  Rosie O'Donnell as a nun, Dennis O'Leary and Dana Delany as Joshua's parents, and Robert Loggia as the grandfather are excellent in providing a solid and caring adult base for Joshua.  There is a great cadre of child actors surrounding Cross, led by Timothy Reifsynder as Joshua's best friend.The final resolution to the movie is a bit too supernatural for my tastes.  Even so, everything leading up to that ending, especially Rosie's school-ending commentary and Joshua's ""Wide Awake"" speech, both recapping the movie, are excellent.

445395,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6305051135,David Baldwin,"[9, 11]","""Wide Awake"" is a pleasant surprise, indeed.  This is a film that grapples with mature themes, predominantly crisises of faith, not often seen in a major film production.  The main thread to this film involves a 10 year-old boy, Joshua Beal(Joseph Cross) who is grieving the loss of his grandfather(Robert Loggia) and is seeking answers from his peers and his adult associations.  M. Night Shyamalan has proven in his subsequent work that he is an expert director of children and this film is no exception.  Cross feels like a genuine child grappling with feelings unknown beforehand and not some Hollywood stereotype of what a 10 year-old boy is.  The adults in the film are strong archetypes and not buffoons as a lot of them are in films centered around children.  Shyamalan should go back to this film as a reference point in good filmmaking.  I have contended for years that as great a film as ""The Sixth Sense"" was it was a blessing and a curse because since then he has been trying to catch lightning in a bottle.  This film demonstrates that great movies start with great stories.  On a note of trivia, the blue Phillies cap that Rosie O'Donnell wears in the film was used by the team in 1994 during day games.  The cap was dropped by the team because the players thought it was bad luck because they lost all but one game in which they wore it.",4,A Real Eye Opener From Shyamalan,1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,1353,"['Wide', 'Awake', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'indeed', 'film', 'mature', 'themes', 'predominantly', 'faith', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'major', 'film', 'production', 'main', 'thread', 'film', '10', 'year-old', 'boy', 'Joshua', 'Beal', 'Joseph', 'Cross', 'who', 'grieving', 'loss', 'grandfather', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'seeking', 'answers', 'peers', 'adult', 'associations', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'proven', 'subsequent', 'work', 'expert', 'director', 'children', 'film', 'exception', 'Cross', 'feels', 'genuine', 'child', 'grappling', 'feelings', 'unknown', 'beforehand', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'stereotype', 'what', '10', 'year-old', 'boy', 'adults', 'film', 'are', 'strong', 'archetypes', 'not', 'buffoons', 'lot', 'are', 'films', 'centered', 'children', 'Shyamalan', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'film', 'reference', 'point', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'have', 'contended', 'years', 'as', 'great', 'film', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'was', 'blessing', 'curse', 'then', 'been', 'trying', 'catch', 'lightning', 'bottle', 'film', 'great', 'movies', 'start', 'great', 'stories', 'note', 'trivia', 'blue', 'Phillies', 'cap', 'Rosie', ""O'Donnell"", 'film', 'was', 'used', 'team', '1994', 'day', 'games', 'cap', 'was', 'dropped', 'team', 'players', 'thought', 'was', 'bad', 'luck', 'lost', 'one', 'game', 'wore']",Wide Awake VHS

I purchased the movie brand new for the price of a used video tape.The movie really struck a cord with me because I have one grandparent who I am very close to. The movie talks a lot about finding God, but I didn't feel that religion was forced down my throat. This movie made me cry during several scenes. But at the same time, it made me feel better as a person for having watched it. Joseph Cross (Joshua Beal) and Robert Loggia (Josh's grandfather) were my two favorite characters in the movie. The friendship displayed on screen between these two characters seems very genuine. Timothy Reifsnyder was fantastic as Josh's best friend. It's hard for me to believe that this was a film debut for either Joseph or Tim.. They both seemed like veteran actors. Especially Joseph. I will be looking to see what other movies these two show up in. I would like to publicly acknowledge the hard work put in by everyone involved with making this movie.

I did, for months; the film was in my libray's DVD collection and I gave it nary a glance.Until I realized who the director was.M. Night Shyamalan has quickly become one of my favorite writer/directors.  His films have deep religious themes of faith, hope, and redemption.  Unlike 95% of Hollywood fare - in which film is hung on nothing (thematically empty) - Shyamalan's work uses the ghost story, the comic book superhero, and alien visitation (""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"") as frameworks for his message of redemtpion - his search for God.So, after finding that ""Wide Awake"" is the Shymalan film that immediately preceeded ""The Sixth Sense"", I watched it.  I honestly must say I was not expecting much, just some faltering steps by a young filmmaker on the rise.But, I was very pleasantly surprised by the depth and maturity of this film!  Shymalan understands that the most profound themes are communicated through the smallest events.  This film abounds with cherished meaning, those bright mileposts on the road of childhood that point to maturity.Young Joshua's search for God is successful, but not in the way he expected.This film, despite a somewhat silly encounter in the very last scene, is a triumph of understatement and beauty.

This seems to be the unfortunate and undeserved fate of Wide Awake, a small gem. This is a true &quot;family  film&quot; in that it is not just a substitute babysitter for a couple of  hours, during which the parents can doze off. It's a film that a parent  will enjoy discussing with his/her children, because it raises some very  important issues -- dealing with the death of a loved one, faith, the  search for God -- but does so from the perspective of a 10-year-old boy.  The film is remarkable on several counts, perhaps the most important of  which is the fact that the screeenplay never condescends to its young hero.  Joshua is dealing with problems that are very real to him, and the film  refuses to make light of them, simply because he is only ten. Another very  nice touch is the avoidance of portraying the adults as black-and-white  caracatures. And the nuns and priest at Josh's Catholic school are not the  dogmatic cardboard characters one often sees in films. Both Rosie O'  Donnell's nun and Dan Luria's priest are aware that there are no simple  answers for the issues which are troubling Josh; as adults they know that  one must move on after the death of a loved one, but they are also aware  that this is not so easy for a young boy or girl. The film contains a  number of wonderful moments involving Josh, his friends, and his  schoolmates.  One of the most moving is when Josh is called before the  class to recap what he has learned during the year.

As the school year opens, Joshua Beal (Joseph Cross) is sad over the recent death of his grandfather (Robert Loggia) . On his first day at school, Joshua is harassed by the class bully. Because his grandfather played football, Joshua tries out for the school team, over the objections of his parents (Dana Delaney and Denis Leary), two physicians who don't like the risk of injury. But Joshua is not very athletic and does not make the team. Joshua continues to seek answers from God about his grandfather, so his teacher, Sister Terry (Rosie O'Donnell) advises him to approach a cardinal who is coming to visit the nearby girls' school. Joshua meets a young girl at the school and falls for her. As the year goes by, Joshua continues his quest for spiritual answers and finds them in unexpected places, such as a winter snowstorm.The main characters are Joshua Beal (Joseph Cross), Mrs.Beal (Dana Delany), Sister Terry  (Rosie O'Donnell), Neena Beal (Julia Stiles), grandfather Beal (Robert Loggia) and Mr.Beal  (Denis Leary).I like this movie because of that way that it is structured, meaning the way that it is put together, the characters seem as if they already knew each other for a very long time.I would recommend this movie to kids age 5 to 12 but, it's really a family movie that parents would enjoy as well. I give this movie 4  out of 5 stars because some of the music doesn't go well with the scenes.Reviewed by Valdi B., KIDS FIRST!

This is one of those movies.I am not sure why some reviewers lament that it's a pretentious theme. Sure, it's not anything that'd be seen rocking boxoffice records or winning grand prizes, it even has some necessary contrivances. But it moved me, impelled me to think, and impressed me with a number of brilliant moments that are sensitive and engaging without becoming cloying.Shyamalan is now a familiar name, so I approached his debut effort with high expectations, and while it could be sappy in bits for some people, I'm guilty of  having clung on until the very last shot. The writing is taut and the production values are all-round immaculate. I was not disappointed one bit!If you have kids, this is a fantastic movie to watch because of the sweet yet universal messages it couches. Plus, the kids in the movie are not freckled 10-year old brats, they have thoughts deeper than what you and I give them credit for.The script is by no stretch of imagination an overly ambitious one, but I highly recommend this underrated gem for its thoughtful dialogue and crisp direction.",5,"DIFFICULT QUESTIONS, SIMPLE ANSWERS: ENCHANTING FILM",1088899200,"07 4, 2004",2004,1291,"['know', 'when', 'catch', 'late', 'night', 'movie', 'film', 'channel', 'then', 'keep', 'watching', 'laugh', 'cry', 'just', 'purely', 'enjoy', 'feel', 'good', 'flicked', 'channel', 'right', 'time', 'one', 'movies.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'reviewers', 'lament', 'pretentious', 'theme', 'Sure', 'not', 'anything', ""'d"", 'be', 'seen', 'rocking', 'boxoffice', 'records', 'winning', 'grand', 'prizes', 'even', 'necessary', 'contrivances', 'moved', 'impelled', 'think', 'impressed', 'number', 'brilliant', 'moments', 'are', 'sensitive', 'engaging', 'becoming', 'cloying.Shyamalan', 'now', 'familiar', 'name', 'approached', 'debut', 'effort', 'high', 'expectations', 'could', 'be', 'sappy', 'bits', 'people', ""'m"", 'guilty', 'having', 'clung', 'very', 'last', 'shot', 'writing', 'taut', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'all-round', 'immaculate', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'one', 'bit', 'have', 'kids', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'watch', 'sweet', 'yet', 'universal', 'messages', 'kids', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'freckled', '10-year', 'old', 'brats', 'have', 'thoughts', 'deeper', 'what', 'give', 'credit', 'for.The', 'script', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'overly', 'ambitious', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend', 'underrated', 'gem', 'thoughtful', 'dialogue', 'crisp', 'direction']",Wide Awake VHS

It's a touching, poignant look at growing up in a Catholic school, but yet it's about far more than that. The young protagonist is struggling with belief. Through his relationship with his grandfather, and his relationships with his sister, parents, and friend, he humorously explores his doubts. In some ways, it's very different from Shamalan's other films, yet like so many of them, it does explore the world - both seen and unseen.
