I was enlightened about his trials and tribulations along the way of getting to his widespread acceptance.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to know more about this messenger of God.,5,Billy Graham - God's Ambassador,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,330,"['one', 'best', 'overall', 'reviews', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'historical', 'background', 'preaching', 'God', 'word', 'have', 'ever', 'experienced', 'was', 'enlightened', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'way', 'getting', 'widespread', 'acceptance', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'messenger', 'God']",Billy Graham: God's Ambassador

973137,A3AN0NXHARI55Q,B000EHSV8M,Magic Lemur,"[0, 0]","Whether or not you believe in God, this DVD provides a very thought provoking view of one of America's most famous preachers and a master of the spoken word. Although it has a bias towards the man, you can see why as Billy Graham has been the confidante of every single US president since Truman and has had a profound and enduring impact on American, if not World affairs.The DVD starts off with the usual selection of 'best of' moments. Although David Frost* makes the point that no other man could pack as many stadiums as Billy Graham, one does get the impression that he is just another Southern preacher who talks the talk but probably doesn't walk the walk.As the DVD begins going through his life it starts to turn interesting. His rise, for its time, was meteoric with him starting off as a lowly farm boy and quickly rising (once in the church) to State-wide, region-wide and nationwide preacher. On the way he seems to be in the forefront of inventions that later evangelists adopted, such as radio evangelism, 'crusades' in major cities as well as the much imitated set of rules he created, setting him apart from previous corrupt preachers.After showing some of Billy Graham's crusades in America, he then proceeds to travel abroad to places such the UK, and eventually the Soviet Union. Although his job seems easy in retrospect, it is amazing to see him let into so many anti-Christian and even Atheistic states (like North Korea and China) and see that it is not just places like America that attract mass crowds to Christian gatherings, but also places like Britain and the Eastern Bloc.The documentary ends with current events, his family and more words of praise from various acquaintances of the man. In the extras there is an interview with David Frost, and there are snippets of crusades and interviews with the director etc.To conclude, I would say the documentary was a bit too long and was formulaic in its structure by showing too many sycophants and not enough criticism. However, if you research on the internet, you will find that people are either in Zombie like esteem or irrationally hateful of him, and this DVD seems to strike the right balance. This doesn't mean it is a good documentary as a result (hence not 5*), but its content and delivery do make it worthwhile watching.",4,An Eloquent Christian,1286323200,"10 6, 2010",2010,2311,"['Whether', 'not', 'believe', 'God', 'DVD', 'very', 'thought', 'provoking', 'view', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'famous', 'preachers', 'master', 'spoken', 'word', 'bias', 'man', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'been', 'confidante', 'single', 'US', 'president', 'Truman', 'had', 'profound', 'enduring', 'impact', 'American', 'not', 'World', 'affairs.The', 'DVD', 'usual', 'selection', ""'best"", 'moments', 'David', 'Frost*', 'point', 'other', 'man', 'could', 'pack', 'many', 'stadiums', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'one', 'get', 'impression', 'just', 'Southern', 'preacher', 'who', 'talk', 'probably', ""n't"", 'walk', 'walk.As', 'DVD', 'going', 'life', 'turn', 'interesting', 'rise', 'time', 'was', 'meteoric', 'starting', 'off', 'lowly', 'farm', 'boy', 'quickly', 'rising', 'once', 'church', 'State-wide', 'region-wide', 'nationwide', 'preacher', 'way', 'be', 'forefront', 'inventions', 'later', 'evangelists', 'adopted', 'such', 'radio', 'evangelism', ""'crusades"", 'major', 'cities', 'as', 'well', 'much', 'imitated', 'set', 'rules', 'created', 'setting', 'apart', 'previous', 'corrupt', 'preachers.After', 'showing', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'crusades', 'America', 'then', 'travel', 'abroad', 'places', 'such', 'UK', 'eventually', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'job', 'easy', 'retrospect', 'amazing', 'see', 'let', 'so', 'many', 'anti-Christian', 'even', 'Atheistic', 'states', 'North', 'Korea', 'China', 'see', 'not', 'just', 'places', 'America', 'attract', 'mass', 'crowds', 'Christian', 'gatherings', 'also', 'places', 'Britain', 'Eastern', 'Bloc.The', 'documentary', 'ends', 'current', 'events', 'family', 'more', 'words', 'praise', 'various', 'acquaintances', 'man', 'extras', 'interview', 'David', 'Frost', 'are', 'snippets', 'crusades', 'interviews', 'director', 'etc.To', 'conclude', 'would', 'say', 'documentary', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'formulaic', 'structure', 'showing', 'too', 'many', 'sycophants', 'not', 'enough', 'criticism', 'However', 'research', 'internet', 'will', 'find', 'people', 'are', 'either', 'Zombie', 'esteem', 'irrationally', 'hateful', 'DVD', 'strike', 'right', 'balance', ""n't"", 'mean', 'good', 'documentary', 'result', 'hence', 'not', '5*', 'content', 'delivery', 'do', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'watching']",Billy Graham: God's Ambassador
973138,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B000EHSV8M,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[0, 0]",In this excellent biography we see how one man changed the course of history by preaching the truth in love. Before watching this DVD I had no idea of the commanding presence of Billy Graham and how powerful a simple message of hope could be. What is really amazing is how many countries he traveled to and how God opened doors for him to preach all over the world. The world would truly be a very different place without Billy Graham. I was humbled and blessed after watching this film about his life. You will be amazed at how many famous people's lives were changed because they spoke to Billy Graham. What an amazing life! My father was also an evangelist and traveled to many of the same countries to preach in the open air. While my father didn't talk about Billy Graham I have a feeling that he was deeply influenced by his life.~The Rebecca Review,5,A Man Who Changed the World,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,855,"['excellent', 'biography', 'see', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'changed', 'course', 'history', 'preaching', 'truth', 'love', 'watching', 'DVD', 'had', 'idea', 'commanding', 'presence', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'how', 'powerful', 'simple', 'message', 'hope', 'could', 'be', 'What', 'really', 'amazing', 'how', 'many', 'countries', 'traveled', 'how', 'God', 'opened', 'doors', 'preach', 'world', 'world', 'would', 'truly', 'be', 'very', 'different', 'place', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'was', 'humbled', 'blessed', 'watching', 'film', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'many', 'famous', 'people', 'lives', 'were', 'changed', 'spoke', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'What', 'amazing', 'life', 'father', 'was', 'also', 'evangelist', 'traveled', 'many', 'same', 'countries', 'preach', 'open', 'air', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'talk', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'have', 'feeling', 'was', 'deeply', 'influenced', 'life.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Billy Graham: God's Ambassador
