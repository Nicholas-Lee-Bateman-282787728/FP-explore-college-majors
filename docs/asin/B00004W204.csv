Something that's a significant shortcoming given the dialects and accents and background music one must attempt to navigate to fully appreciate the beginning portions of this film.The DVD package spreads the film over two discs and includes several documentaries that include 1960's era interview footage with most of the major characters in the events. While interesting they point out differences in viewpoint from the movie that they're attached to and what results is as much a commentary on how we rewrite history as much as on the events unfolded.The DVD quality suffers here as well. One should not expect video footage of the 60's era to be up to modern standards but the editing of that footage was very poor in this DVD package.

If I remember correctly there is a Dieppe memorial park in Windsor, so I was always curious about the Dieppe raid.  From what I understood it was a colossal messup and this movie seems to reinforce that.  Dieppe makes the Arnhem thing look like a stroke of genius.  It seems that everything was indicating this was going to be a colossal failure but the people in charge of the operation weren't paying attention, except for the Canadians.  Anyways, it was nice to see a movie that showed some other belligerents besides the US, Britain, Germany and Russia.

Actually wrote a review which appears to have been lost.Anyway, I loved this film for its realistic portrayal.You feel sorry for the Canadians who have been part of the cause since the beginning but have yet to get their troops 'into the game' before the boys from south of the border come in and take things over. However one should learn from this one that getting into the game is a good thing but one should still be very careful in the doing. This one cost Canadian troops blood. Lots of casualties and achieved nothing.It is a story of naked egos. Dicky Mountbatten's in peticular. For this is his mess. His ego got it going and into the meat grinder not for any great allied goal but just to make himself a name. The fellow who portays him does this job quite well.It also shows how not to get an operation like this going. Shows how this was mishandled from the beginning.A good cast. Well portrayed. Easy to identify with. The leading Canadian General in peticular one can like and identify with. In adition there is that rogue in the ranks. A good story. A wonderful set of scenes.

553277,A34ZM36508LG9G,B00004W204,R. A Forczyk,"[34, 36]","The Anglo-Canadian raid on the German-held port of Dieppe on 19 August 1942, known as Operation &quot;Jubilee&quot;, was a tragic failure.  Over 3,000 mostly Canadian soldiers were killed or captured in just over seven hours.  The mini-series Dieppe attempts to recreate the events leading up to this tragedy on two levels: the men at high levels who argued for and planned the raid, and the soldiers at squad-level who had to execute it.  As a war drama, Dieppe is relatively standard fare, following the traditional format of focusing on a squad of Canadian privates in the Royal Regiment of Canada, 2nd Canadian Division.  This aspect of the film is very predictable, including romance angles (somehow, the movie industry feels that the portrayal of historical events would be unintelligible without a love triangle or two), and not particularly satisfying.  The soldiers are introduced, prepare for the mission, wait and are then killed in a few moments of intense slaughter.  The closing scene in Gallipoli is clearly mimicked, but without the suspense of waiting one's turn to be mown down.  In Dieppe, they pretty much all die at one go.However the most interesting part of the mini-series and the most controversial, is in the way it assigns blame for this fiasco.  The key man is Lord Louis Mountbatten, who was assigned to take over Combined Operations in October 1941.  Mountbatten was ordered by Churchill to conduct commando raids on occupied Europe and to harass the enemy.  Some of these raids were successful (and they are not mentioned in this film), others were not.  In conjunction with other leaders, including General Montgomery, Mountbatten decided to launch a division-size raid on the port of Dieppe.  No operation of this size had ever been attempted before.  The mini-series portrays Mountbatten as the arrogant, amateurish villain of this tragedy, who uses the raid to supposedly promote his own selfish career interests.  In fact, all the British senior planners in the raid, including Montgomery, are depicted as intense, idiotic and inflexible.  They lie to the Canadians about the German defenses and the air and naval support that will be provided.On the other hand, the high-level Canadian army leaders are portrayed as a mixture of opportunists and victims.  The corps commander volunteers his division to &quot;do something&quot; before the American army &quot;steals the show&quot;.  The senior Canadian commanders suspect the mission will flop but bite their lips.  Major General Roberts, the division commander, is the most sympathetic character in the entire film, as first the division and then a difficult mission are dumped in his lap.  Roberts is depicted as an honest, caring commander who wants to accomplish the mission and return with as many of his boys as possible.  I strongly recommend professional army officers who are interested in joint operations to pay particular attention to Roberts role, because they are many genuine problems of interservice coordination laid bare therein.  Unfortunately, this mini-series puts too negative a spin on the reasons for the tragedy.  There was amateurish planning and mistakes made, but no British conspiracy.  Mountbatten was far from the self-serving snob portrayed in this film.For those viewers who expect to see an action-packed war movie, they will be disappointed by the actual landing, which only occurs in the last half-hour of the film.  The budget must have been fairly low, because the focus is only on &quot;Blue Beach&quot; (there were seven other beaches landed on that morning).  There is no coverage of other units, tanks landed or the massive air battle overhead.  As in old style war movies, the enemy is never visible except for muzzle flashes.  On Blue Beach, the Royal Regiment of Canada lost all but 60 of 543 troops landed.  The film suggests that their sacrifice was in vain but this is far from the truth, given the huge improvement in Allied amphibious techniques between August 1942 and June 1944.  The film's suggestion that the &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; explanation was a cynical ex post facto deception is scurrilous.Dieppe is not the most accurate war movie or the most exciting, but it does have a great value in depicting the difficulties in mounting joint operations.  Rather than the detailed dramatization of the actual operation that it attempts to portray, Dieppe should be viewed as a cautionary military fable about how the best laid plans can fall apart.  It is superb in depicting how many little &quot;want of a nail&quot; issues can mount up to set the stage for disaster.  However viewers should not accept the portrayals of historical individuals, particularly those who can no longer defend their reputations, at face value.",4,A Cautionary Military Fable,990316800,"05

553278,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00004W204,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[6, 6]","""Dieppe"" tells the story of a large, costly raid by allied troops on the French coast in the late summer of 1942.  Whether the ""raid"" was a success or failure, and to what extent it was either, aren't questions expressly resolved in this made-for TV movie - though the script makes it obvious where it stands.  In 1942 there were hints that the tide was turning for allies on every front but western Europe.  (American in the Pacific had by then contained Japanese forces in the battle of Coral Sea, and decisively defeated them at Midway; However, the battle for Stalingrad had barely begun, while the second battle of El Alamein in North Africa was months away.)  Thus, pressure was mounting against England to match the heat that others brought to bear against the Axis.  With American involvement still limited, the British tried to make do with raids - attacks meant to hurt the enemy without seeking long-term gains.  This film posits Dieppe, the latest and largest of the raids, followed a policy of show-warfare - a propaganda mission meant to parallel the stirring but militarily irrelevant Doolittle raid on Tokyo.  Early successful raids (like one on ports in Occupied France used to shelter Nazi battleships and surface raiders) only spur the British to mount even more daring attacks.  With Lord Mountbatten pressured by Churchill to do something to impress Stalin and the Americans, the plan to mount an amphibious raid on the French coast with a division-sized force quickly comes into play.  With Montgomery planning a direct assault, and the RN and RAF pledged to support the landing forces with their battleships and bombers, the British turn to Canadian troops to hit Dieppe.This flick follows the players in the raid - the planners, and a sliver of the Canadians meant to stand in for all the soldiers.  At the outset, the signs of disaster seem clear to everybody - Soldiers who can't cross the channel without getting sea-sick, or the landing craft navigators who can't seem to find the French coast; Montgomery is obsessed with his plans, even as he learns of plan changes after the fact (the RN, stretched thin already, yanks their battleships - a fact Monty learns off-the-cuff at a staff meeting).  If Montgomery appears a victim of his own ambitions, Lord Mountbatten (Victor Garber) is the obvious villain, blithely enabling the other planners to prepare the raid, even though its overall military purpose never materializes, and the anticipated human costs rise.  As in ""A Bridge Too Far"", the British plan follows the line of least resistance - anticipating only the best-case scenario.  If Mountbatten is the baddie, then the hero is Canadian Mag-Gen Roberts, who signs his soldiers onto the raid and stays loyal to it even as it unravels.  Though he knows the Canadians need to do something for the war, he never loses his doubts or his concern for his troops.  By the end of the battle (which occupies the last half-hour of the movie) Dieppe is littered with the dead for no apparent profit, while the leads try to make sense of it all.  Mountbatten, unaffected by the suffering expended to hit Dieppe, boldly claims the operation a crucial learning experience for the eventual invasion of Europe.  It's unclear how D-Day would have looked had the Dieppe raid been cut, but the script here makes it all but obvious that even Mountbatten thought the excuse facile - an after the fact claim needed to explain the immense costs of the raid.  Roberts looks ennobled in comparison; though one wonders what role he could have had in forestalling, altering or simply canning a division-sized landing made for no strategic objective.  The script implies Roberts as torn between his duties as a soldier and his loyalty to his men - but did loyalty really require he squander his men in an unnecessary raid?  Thanks to George C. Scott, we know that a soldier's job is to make sure that the enemy gets to do all the dying, but then again, given the choice ahead of time, nobody wanted to be the guy who got to spend the war shoveling horse hockey in Louisiana.I'm no historian, but I found this flick at least compelling enough for me to look further, and sometimes, that's the best you can get from TV.",3,"factually questionable, but still compelling.",1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,4225,"['Dieppe', 'story', 'large', 'costly', 'raid', 'allied', 'troops', 'French', 'coast', 'late', 'summer', '1942', 'raid', 'was', 'success', 'failure', 'what', 'extent', 'was', 'either', 'are', ""n't"", 'questions', 'expressly', 'resolved', 'made-for', 'TV', 'movie', 'script', 'obvious', 'where', '1942', 'were', 'hints', 'tide', 'was', 'turning', 'allies', 'front', 'western', 'Europe', 'American', 'Pacific', 'had', 'then', 'contained', 'Japanese', 'forces', 'battle', 'Coral', 'Sea', 'decisively', 'defeated', 'Midway', 'However', 'battle', 'Stalingrad', 'had', 'barely', 'begun', 'second', 'battle', 'El', 'Alamein', 'North', 'Africa', 'was', 'months', 'away', 'Thus', 'pressure', 'was', 'mounting', 'England', 'match', 'heat', 'others', 'brought', 'bear', 'Axis', 'American', 'involvement', 'still', 'limited', 'British', 'tried', 'make', 'do', 'raids', 'attacks', 'meant', 'hurt', 'enemy', 'seeking', 'long-term', 'gains', 'film', 'Dieppe', 'latest', 'largest', 'raids', 'followed', 'policy', 'show-warfare', 'propaganda', 'mission', 'meant', 'parallel', 'stirring', 'militarily', 'irrelevant', 'Doolittle', 'raid', 'Tokyo', 'Early', 'successful', 'raids', 'one', 'ports', 'Occupied', 'France', 'used', 'shelter', 'Nazi', 'battleships', 'surface', 'raiders', 'only', 'spur', 'British', 'mount', 'even', 'more', 'daring', 'attacks', 'Lord', 'Mountbatten', 'pressured', 'Churchill', 'do', 'something', 'impress', 'Stalin', 'Americans', 'plan', 'mount', 'amphibious', 'raid', 'French', 'coast', 'division-sized', 'force', 'quickly', 'play', 'Montgomery', 'planning', 'direct', 'assault', 'RN', 'RAF', 'pledged', 'support', 'landing', 'forces', 'battleships', 'bombers', 'British', 'turn', 'Canadian', 'troops', 'hit', 'Dieppe.This', 'flick', 'players', 'raid', 'planners', 'sliver', 'Canadians', 'meant', 'stand', 'soldiers', 'outset', 'signs', 'disaster', 'seem', 'clear', 'everybody', 'Soldiers', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cross', 'channel', 'getting', 'sea-sick', 'landing', 'craft', 'navigators', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'French', 'coast', 'Montgomery', 'obsessed', 'plans', 'even', 'plan', 'changes', 'fact', 'RN', 'stretched', 'thin', 'already', 'yanks', 'battleships', 'fact', 'Monty', 'off-the-cuff', 'staff', 'meeting', 'Montgomery', 'victim', 'own', 'ambitions', 'Lord', 'Mountbatten', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'obvious', 'villain', 'blithely', 'enabling', 'other', 'planners', 'prepare', 'raid', 'even', 'overall', 'military', 'purpose', 'never', 'anticipated', 'human', 'costs', 'rise', 'A', 'Bridge', 'Too', 'Far', 'British', 'plan', 'line', 'least', 'resistance', 'anticipating', 'only', 'best-case', 'scenario', 'Mountbatten', 'baddie', 'then', 'hero', 'Canadian', 'Mag-Gen', 'Roberts', 'who', 'signs', 'soldiers', 'raid', 'loyal', 'even', 'Canadians', 'need', 'do', 'something', 'war', 'never', 'doubts', 'concern', 'troops', 'end', 'battle', 'last', 'half-hour', 'movie', 'Dieppe', 'littered', 'dead', 'apparent', 'profit', 'leads', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'Mountbatten', 'unaffected', 'suffering', 'expended', 'hit', 'Dieppe', 'boldly', 'operation', 'crucial', 'learning', 'experience', 'eventual', 'invasion', 'Europe', 'unclear', 'how', 'D-Day', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'had', 'Dieppe', 'raid', 'been', 'cut', 'script', 'here', 'obvious', 'even', 'Mountbatten', 'thought', 'excuse', 'facile', 'fact', 'claim', 'needed', 'explain', 'immense', 'costs', 'raid', 'Roberts', 'ennobled', 'comparison', 'one', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'forestalling', 'altering', 'simply', 'canning', 'division-sized', 'landing', 'made', 'strategic', 'objective', 'script', 'Roberts', 'torn', 'duties', 'soldier', 'loyalty', 'men', 'did', 'loyalty', 'really', 'require', 'squander', 'men', 'unnecessary', 'raid', 'Thanks', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'know', 'soldier', 'job', 'make', 'sure', 'enemy', 'do', 'dying', 'then', 'again', 'given', 'choice', 'ahead', 'time', 'nobody', 'wanted', 'be', 'guy', 'who', 'got', 'spend', 'war', 'shoveling', 'horse', 'hockey', 'Louisiana.I', ""'m"", 'historian', 'found', 'flick', 'least', 'compelling', 'enough', 'look', 'further', 'sometimes', 'best', 'can', 'get', 'TV']",Dieppe VHS
