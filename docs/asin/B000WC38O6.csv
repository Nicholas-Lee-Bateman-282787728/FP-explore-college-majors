1108128,A2VNHNS58QI0NO,B000WC38O6,"Betty L. Wilkins ""star gazer""","[0, 0]","only bits and snatches of these programs when I was growing up. While &#34;Happily Ever After&#34;and &#34;Snow White Christmas&#34; were barely memorable, &#34;Journey back to Oz&#34; stuck in my mind for some reason. I was surprised to find they were on DVD after all this time. Sadly, &#34;Happily Ever After&#34; and &#34;Snow White Christmas&#34; seemed thrown together and somewhat silly, as though the makers were searching for ideas and could have been done a bit better even with what they had. I still admired what work went into the animation though the stories themselves did it somewhat poor justice. &#34;Journey back to Oz&#34; was more of a masterpiece despite what detractors may say about it, perhaps because of the star talent involved. It was a major special on TV at the time and more work was involved which gave this a much better quality than the others. One can see this in the way the characters looked and even the elephants looked a bit more real in the way they were depicted, as though someone took the time to study them. Certainly, I see very little for anyone to be embarrassed about in this one. It was a bit silly, yes, but some of the songs do grow on you after awhile. In this day and age, we still do need a bit of nostalgia.",4,I remember....,1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,1263,"['only', 'bits', 'snatches', 'programs', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', '34', 'Happily', 'Ever', '34', '34', 'Snow', 'White', 'Christmas', '34', 'were', 'barely', 'memorable', '34', 'Journey', 'back', 'Oz', '34', 'stuck', 'mind', 'reason', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'were', 'DVD', 'time', 'Sadly', '34', 'Happily', 'Ever', '34', '34', 'Snow', 'White', 'Christmas', '34', 'seemed', 'together', 'somewhat', 'silly', 'makers', 'were', 'searching', 'ideas', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'bit', 'better', 'even', 'what', 'had', 'still', 'admired', 'what', 'work', 'went', 'animation', 'stories', 'did', 'somewhat', 'poor', 'justice', '34', 'Journey', 'back', 'Oz', '34', 'was', 'more', 'masterpiece', 'what', 'detractors', 'may', 'say', 'perhaps', 'star', 'talent', 'involved', 'was', 'major', 'special', 'TV', 'time', 'more', 'work', 'was', 'involved', 'gave', 'much', 'better', 'quality', 'others', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'way', 'characters', 'looked', 'even', 'elephants', 'looked', 'bit', 'more', 'real', 'way', 'were', 'depicted', 'someone', 'took', 'time', 'study', 'Certainly', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'anyone', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'about', 'one', 'was', 'bit', 'silly', 'yes', 'songs', 'do', 'grow', 'awhile', 'day', 'age', 'still', 'do', 'need', 'bit', 'nostalgia']",N/A
