1108757,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000WCN8Q4,Cubist,"[6, 8]","Sex and Breakfast is about two twentysomething couples going through the usual relationship problems. Miles Brandman's film examines how these couples communicate (and also how they fail to do so) we each other. At times, this film wants to be the nextsex, lies, and videotapefor the new Millennium with its frank talk about sex, disaffected twentysomethings and an independent film aesthetic, including the requisite indie rock soundtrack. Sadly, Sex and Breakfast is closer to one of the many wannabes that came out in the wake of Sex, Lies' success, likeBodies, Rest & Motion,Sleep With Me, and countless others since. The writing is competent but hardly exceptional and the leads acquit themselves just fine. There is nothing explicitly revealed visually and the issues that are raised are not dealt with in any daringly original way or with any kind of complexity, like in Sex, Lies and Videotape.Sex and Breakfast only really gets interesting at the film's conclusion. If more time had been spent on this part, we might have had a better film. Its fatal flaw is that the film fails to examine its themes in a deeper, more meaningful way and the end result is a fine, if average attempt.",3,Twentysomethings Falling In & Out of Love,1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,1192,"['Sex', 'Breakfast', 'two', 'twentysomething', 'couples', 'going', 'usual', 'relationship', 'problems', 'Miles', 'Brandman', 'film', 'how', 'couples', 'communicate', 'also', 'how', 'fail', 'do', 'so', 'other', 'times', 'film', 'be', 'nextsex', 'videotapefor', 'new', 'Millennium', 'frank', 'talk', 'sex', 'disaffected', 'twentysomethings', 'independent', 'film', 'aesthetic', 'including', 'requisite', 'indie', 'rock', 'soundtrack', 'Sadly', 'Sex', 'Breakfast', 'closer', 'one', 'many', 'wannabes', 'came', 'out', 'wake', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'success', 'likeBodies', 'Rest', 'Motion', 'Sleep', 'Me', 'countless', 'others', 'writing', 'competent', 'hardly', 'exceptional', 'leads', 'acquit', 'just', 'fine', 'nothing', 'explicitly', 'revealed', 'visually', 'issues', 'are', 'raised', 'are', 'not', 'dealt', 'daringly', 'original', 'way', 'kind', 'complexity', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'Videotape.Sex', 'Breakfast', 'only', 'really', 'interesting', 'film', 'conclusion', 'more', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'spent', 'part', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'film', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'film', 'examine', 'themes', 'deeper', 'more', 'meaningful', 'way', 'end', 'result', 'fine', 'average', 'attempt']",Sex and Breakfast
1108758,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000WCN8Q4,Grady Harp,"[22, 24]","Though many will avoid this little film because the title and DVD cover suggest a mindless m&eacute;lange of sexual encounters, those who can get past these flaws will find a well written (Miles Brandman) examination of young people's concepts of relationships and how to keep them.  Brandman also directs this stylish charmer and has at his disposal actors not usually associated with a more serious type of story.James (Macaulay Culkin) and Heather (Alexis Dziena) are young, attractive and in love, though Heather is finally able to confide in James that she is unable to achieve orgasm in their otherwise satisfactory sex life. Ellis (Kuno Becker) and Renee (Eliza Dushku) are another couple whose intimate life has lost its sparkle.  Each of the couples (who have never met) hears about sex therapist Dr. Wellbridge (Joanna Miles) who supports the concept of group sex as a means to strengthen relationships grown stale.  Each couple meets with the doctor, reveals their insecurities and fears and Dr. Wellbridge arranges a 'session' for the two couples to share  an evening of intimate interaction.  How this 'change' alters each couple's relationship is the message of the film: some surprises are in store that are unsuspected.Yes, there is comedy here and yes, there is thoughtful dialog, but the pleasure of the film lies in discovering the expanded acting abilities demonstrated by these four young attractive actors.  The film may not be deep, but it does entertain and it most certainly has some useful information about love and relationships we all need to know.
