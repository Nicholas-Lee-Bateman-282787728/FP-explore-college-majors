1504183,AYG1U47VFZ165,B005V4X8V8,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[14, 15]","I'm not a gamer.  That may come as a surprise to most of you who I believe will be drawn to this review almost entirely seeking the endorsement of an established gamer.  Before I opened the package bearing the copy of TOM CLANCY'S GHOST RECON: ALPHA I had never so much as heard of TOM CLANCY'S GHOST RECON; I didn't know it was an established gaming franchise; I didn't know anything more than `Tom Clancy' is an established author of very credible techno-military thrillers ... but I was probably as equally excited as you are to see what this ALPHA film was all about, and, let me tell you, I was riveted.  ALPHA - slated for release on May 22 along with Ubisoft's ""Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier"" video game for Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation 3 - is nothing short of brilliant.Now, a little back history here ...As best as I understand it, Ubisoft launched the Tom Clancy Ghost Recon brand back in 2001, and it boasts a series of video games in and around the fictional military universe created by the author himself.  From what I learned from the `making of' featurette on the disc, Ghost Recon crosses into several entertainment platforms - games, films, and books - and capitalizes specifically on the characters and situations created by Mr. Clancy in delivering high suspense military adventures, all set against a backdrop of international intrigue.  These soldiers are part-combat-specialists, part-special-ops-soldiers, as well as part-spies, and they're equipped with only the best state-of-the-art equipment that the military has to offer.As for Alpha's story?Operatives within the U.S. intelligence community have finally closed in on Chevchenko, a villain involved with all measures of international badness.  The Ghost team is sent in to stop the delivery of Bulava class nuclear weapon.  The stakes are high, but the team will stop at nothing to keep America safe from nuclear terrorism.  Specifically, ALPHA's story serves as a prequel to the `Future Soldier' game.To put it bluntly, this 25-minute film contains as much action as some full features I've seen.  And I'm not talking low-brow guns'n'guts action: I'm talking cream-of-the-crop elite military engagements here.  Ubisoft spared no expense in crafting this tense little flick, bringing in some behind-the-scenes talent who contributed to such features as CHILDREN OF MEN, BLACK HAWK DOWN, and THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM.  Additionally, they brought in Military Weapons Specialist Harry Humphries (I've heard of Humphries contributions to other films, and he's a bit of a Hollywood legend), who's served as a consultant to such films as TRANSFORMERS, IRON MAN, and THOR.  I hated hated hated for this to end - though I suspected it would when I realized it was, essentially, an elongated set-up for a game - but what was delivered was terrific.And, yes, maybe (just maybe) this will infuriate folks who hate being mildly `spoiled' - so, if you're inclined, then look away, brave reader, look away - but it all ends on a cliffhanger.  That's right!  It doesn't exactly wrap itself up all neatly in one 25-minute package because it's a set-up for the game.  It may help to think of it as one long commercial - not that there's anything wrong with it - because that's what you get: a hugely successful tease for what I have no doubt will be a hugely successful video game if the film is any indication.The film is a joint production of Ubisoft Entertainment and Little Minx (a subsidiary of Ridley Scott & Associates) along with Flatiron Film Company.  You wouldn't believe it's a short film (and you certainly wouldn't want it to end!) because everything about it is absolutely top notch.  Video production is exceptional; audio production is terrific; and immeasurable great detail has done into every aspect consistently.  When these folks say ""feature film,"" they mean it.  The disc comes with a making-of featurette (at 28 minutes, it's actually longer than the film itself, and it's entirely worth it to see what lengths they went to in putting all of this together) and a single preview that apparently screened at the 2010 Comic-Con.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION with only the single reservation that - as I've already said - I didn't want it to end.  It's a military techno-thriller done by folks who clearly know what that means.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video graciously provided me an advance screener DVD of TOM CLANCY'S GHOST RECON: ALPHA for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",5,ALPHA Rises to the Top!,1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,4533,"[""'m"", 'not', 'gamer', 'may',

1504187,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005V4X8V8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 11]","To take advantage of the release of the eagerly anticipated videogame ""Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier,"" a brilliant and synergistic marketing team has also readied the DVD debut of ""Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Alpha"" for the same date. It's a sound proposition, of course, to push for sales dollars--but, to my estimation, ""Alpha"" (however excellently it is produced) plays more as a game supplement than as a fully realized product of its own. If someone had put this disc in a deluxe version of the game, I would tell you what a great extra it would have been. However, sold on its own, it really isn't a satisfying purchase. Want a movie based off of the Ghost Recon legend? It seems like it would be easy enough to do. But this just seems like an extended cut-scene sequence that you might find in a game that, although beautifully rendered, seems a bit opportunistic as a stand alone purchase.Here's what's included:1) A 20 minute ""Alpha"" movie:  I have sampled a number of these game tie-in movies/DVDs.  Without a doubt, the ""Alpha"" film is among the best in technical presentation.  The plotting of this piece, which stands as a prequel to the new game, has the Ghost team tracking down their arch-nemesis Chevchenko.  As a weapons deal is taking place at an abandoned outpost, all types of mayhem breaks loose which begins an exquisitely choreographed battle sequence.  Although dynamic, none of the characters has been developed (hey, it's only 20 minutes) so it may lack dramatic impact but it makes up for it in visual flair!  This live action footage is feature film quality, the effects are good, and I absolutely loved this brief bit of movie making.  As I said, had it been a game supplement--I'd have given it the highest marks imaginable.  But is it worth the current (subject to change, non-discounted) suggested selling price of 14.95?  It makes it a harder recommendation.2) A 28 minute ""Making-of"" featurette:  At first, I assumed this might also discuss the upcoming game.  But no, it is only about the 20 minute film.  I like this behind-the-scenes kind of stuff, but it's a full third longer than the actual movie!3) A 1 minute trailer of the film.In essence, this DVD purchase offers the consumer NOTHING except this 20 minute movie.  Most other tie-in products to games offer significantly more game extras, back stories, featurettes, etc..  This one doesn't even mention the game or, indeed, the entire series.  It's quite odd, because it would have been very simple to use existing material to make this far more collectable and valuable.  So, as much as I loved ""Alpha,"" I think that overall this was a missed opportunity to provide something even more special to longtime fans.  Recommended, but know you are only getting a tiny (but great) action sequence.

It helps if you want to understand the technology, certainly, but it's only loosely attached to the games.The plot is the Ghosts are headed into Russia to assassinate a bad guy by the name of Sokolov. As it turns out, they are in for more than a small surprise with regards to what they actually step into!You get to see active camo, a pretty cool robot drone and the dog... tank... thing. I don't think any of this, other than the flying drone, really appear in game though.For a movie with what is likely not a massive budget, they've done a great job with the special effects, especially with integrating the CG with the real world stuff. Probably helps that one of the guys from District 9 helped out. Acting is top notch.The sound is amazing. The biggest disappointment for me wasn't in the quality, but that it was only stereo. Of course, they have some wonderful separation and so once you're immersed into the world, you hardly notice.Video is top quality as well. High bit rate AVC encoding helps here, I'm sure.The making of actually adds to the enjoyment of the piece over all.So do  you need to play the game to enjoy the film? No. Does it help?
