375951,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,6303465846,Alistair McHarg,"[8, 9]","Death And The Maiden is an overlooked masterpiece and it's not hard to understand why.  First is the dark, serious, and intellectually challenging subject matter which prompts viewers to consider important questions that may ultimately have no satisfactory answers at all.  Second is the format itself.  Death And The Maiden was originally a play, and it shows.  Three characters, frozen in an unholy dynamic, confront their various demons in a small, remote house.  Interaction between them is talky and claustrophobic; the lack of distraction is part of the point.  (Viewers who rely on flaming helicopters, silicon-injected bosoms spilling from bikinis, or artificially sweet deus ex machina happy endings, are advised to look elsewhere.)Third, of course, is the baggage carried by its director, Roman Polanski.  Had Death And The Maiden been made by someone else it would almost certainly have secured at least one Oscar nomination, if not for Ben Kingsley, surely for Sigourney Weaver.  I will not defend Polanski, indeed, it is highly ironic that a film that deals so brilliantly with the idea of torture, specifically rape as a torture technique, would be the product of a man convicted of raping a 13-year old girl.  Those quick to condemn Polanski conveniently forget that he has demons of his own, having endured the slaughter of his wife, Sharon Tate, and unborn child, at the hands of the Manson family.  This provides context only, not an excuse.  It is also quickly forgotten that Polanski's talent puts him in the category with Kubrick; Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby, Death And The Maiden, and The Pianist all bear witness to his incredible gifts.Amazingly enough, the film's plot is incredibly simple.  Either Kingsley's Dr. Miranda is the man who brutally tortured Weaver's Paulina Escobar or he isn't, by the film's end you know.  Arriving at the truth requires stripping away layer after layer of protective veneer, a raw, spellbinding struggle.  Both Weaver and Kingsley are at the top of their game and the chemistry between them is electrifying.  Paulina's husband, played by Stuart Wilson, is the everyman, he is us, we feel his sympathies wavering as he wonders whether his wife is insane or correct.  Weaver is not a sympathetic victim - her Paulina is unhinged, cruel, shrill, and unreasonable.  (Then again, if she's right, wouldn't this be appropriate?)  Kingsley's Dr. Miranda, by contrast, is hardly our picture of a torturer.  He is intelligent, soft-spoken, affable, charming at times, and almost disarmingly reasonable; the scenes where he is drinking with the husband and ""bonding,"" talking about how difficult women can be, are chilling.The engine driving this film is our desire to know if Dr. Miranda is guilty - but that is not really the point.  The payload here is the moral price of this most savage and brutal of all human power relationships, the toll it takes, and the correct response.  Weaver's performance is so well shaped that we see the damage, we see how brittle she is, and we cheer her rage, a dark part of us would help her pull the trigger.  That's why this is such a great movie, we see that part of ourselves, then we question it.  Would it be just?  Would it even help anything?  What if she's wrong?  What if she's right, but Dr. Miranda is now a reformed man who feels profound shame about what he did?  Does that matter?  Assuming Dr. Miranda is guilty, was he pushed to these hideous extremes by devotion to some higher goal, which justified them in his mind?  Is this ever excusable?  (Would we torture a terrorist to extract information that might save thousands?)Don't think that this movie is like a philosophy class, it isn't, it offers a kind of hypnotic entertainment that will galvanize you.  As you become absorbed by this haunting, tiny drama, you and your own conceptions of morality will become another character in it.

375959,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6303465846,Dennis Littrell,"[5, 10]","I would not recommend this for most people.  It is painful to watch and artificial, very stagy (not surprising since it was adapted from a stage play written by Ariel Dorfman), and ultimately not redemptive (as the video jacket claims), but perverse and depressing.Sigourney Weaver gives a raw-edged performance almost entirely in one key.  She plays a woman (Pauline Escobar) who was raped and tortured by a Nazi-like doctor named Roberto Miranda played by Ben Kingsley in some unidentified South American country.  Since Dorfman is from Argentina, we'll assume it's Argentina.  Certainly this sort of thing happened there during the time of the ""Disappeared.""  The other member of the three-person cast is her husband (Gerardo Escobar) played by Stuart Wilson.  Roman Polanski directed.The title comes from Franz Schubert's string quartet of the same name which was played by the doctor as he tortured Pauline.This is a polarizing film.  Women who have ever suffered anything at the hands of men will identify with Weaver's character and may find the film brilliant.  Most men will not even be able to watch it.There is some ambiguity in the ending, as to whether Roberto really was guilty as charged.  My opinion is that he was without doubt.  The final scene (which I can't describe since it would give away too much) is really a statement about the nature of horror and how it can live on amidst the most familiar settings, a man patting his son on the head, some people attending a concert.I thought Wilson gave the most balanced performance.  He had the most difficult role since it required subtlety and that he walk a fine line between accepting something monstrous in his presence or disbelieving his wife.  He also had to be a weak sister, as it were, to the dominating presence of Sigourney Weaver who played most of the film with a gun in her hand.  Yet he had to provide the strength of character and to symbolize the sense of justice.  Kingsley looked very much the part of a sneaky little man, and his usual caged intensity was much in evidence.Bottom line: any film that exposes the atrocities committed by the right wing dictatorships that dominated South and Central American during the Cold War is on the side of the angels; however most viewers I think will find this too intense and disturbing.

With Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley, Stuart WilsonThis movie probes into a topic that is rather controversial. The process of justice punishes criminals that commit crimes to sentences that remove their freedom and have tremendous impact morally because of the stigma created by the trial and jail time. But... how do we punish crimes against humanity that were sanctioned by a government?The process of justice is also created so victims find vindication and can go on with their lives after the person ""pays"" for the inflicted crime or damage. In this movie, Sigourney Weaver plays the role of a woman who was brutally assaulted while held captive by men acting on behalf of a previous government. A doctor who was supposed to make the process safe for the victims, participates during her captivity and given so much power, he falls pray to his own devils and inflicts further injury on this woman during her ordeal. Back then she was blind-folded, so she recognizes in the doctor... by smell and voice sound, the man who made her suffer unspeakable torture.The roles are reversed and she now has the power to extract vengeance and she sets out to get the doctor to confess what he had done to her. She wants retribution... she wants the doctor to suffer psychologically as much as she endured, but time is short and we see a give and take that is frightening, always wandering whether the doctor is indeed guilty, or the innocent stranger that triggers the memories of horrific torture. The movie leaves you with the sense that the punishment of crimes is a terrifying process because as we attempt to extract vengeance, we have to turn into the very character that we despise.

The audience doesn't know whether to sympathize with Paulina or be  downright scared of her, which is pretty much the same dilemma her husband  is in.

375970,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6303465846,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[7, 7]","Roman Polanski's ""Death and the Maiden,"" has a main a plot point that would cause most films to fail. A character is confronted with something; They claim they're innocent and the rest of the movie deals with deciding whether they are or they aren't. Usually, if they are guilty...It's not a big surprise. If they're innocent, there was no point in the movie at all. Despite this, this movie works perfectly...With much credit due to the three actors who carrey the movie. Sigourney Weaver ('Galaxy Quest'), Ben Kingsley ('Sexy Beast'), and Stuart Wilson are the actors who are onscreen for 99% of the movie and this movie is powerful and entertaining. Weaver plays Paulina Escobar, a woman who's somewhere in South America in a small shack waiting for her husband to return. On the radio she hears that her husband has just been elected to a committee run by the president of South America. She apparently disapproves. Her husband soon gets home, but minus his car; He had a blowout miles away and a man has given him a ride. After the husband Geraldo (Wilson) and Paulina chat for a bit, she goes to bed. Then the man that gave Geraldo the ride suddenly reappears. The man introduces himself as Dr. Roberto Miranda (Kingsley) and proclaims himself a big fan of Geraldo's. As the two men have a drink and talk in the living room, we see Paulina in the bedroom getting agitated. Eventually, she sneaks out of the house and steals Dr. Miranda's car. Not worrying about it, Geraldo and Dr. Miranda both go to sleep; But Paulina soon returns and ties Miranda to a chair. 15 years ago Paulina was raped, kidnapped, and tortured by a man that she claims is Miranda. She was blindfolded, so all she bases this on is his voice. Her husband doesn't immediately believe her, and really, neither does the audience. It's clear the woman is a bit off. But unlike most movies like this, we actually can't decide if the doctor is guilty or not guilty. I admire the film's ending for not throwing in some heroic cliches. Anyway, Polanski is really good at pacing. Because almost this entire movie is pacing. But, in the end ""Death and the Maiden"" is suspenseful, well-directed, and completely well acted.

Gerardo (Stuart Wilson), her husband, has been appointed to head a commission that will investigate the atrocities of the previous regime, but they are looking at only those cases that resulted in death.  Being raped and tortured is not enough to receive justice.  But then one day, Fate intervenes.  Gerardo is given a ride home by a stranger, Robert Miranda (Ben Kingsley), a local doctor.  Suddenly, in her own home, Paullina, who had been blindfolded during her torture, recognizes the voice of her main torturer.  Instantly, Paulina knows it is time for payback.  She ties up Miranda, stuffs her panties in his mouth, and begins a long attempt to make him confess.&quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; tries to play up the ambiguities of Miranda's character.  After all, perhaps Paulina is mistaken.  But Robert Polanski is directing this film, adapted from Ariel Dorman's stage play, and the director's voyeuristic instincts are not going to work in a story that leaves room for doubt.  As an audience we are caught up not only in what Paulina is doing to strip away Miranda's mask, but in the revelations of what happened to her in the past.  But what is past is prologue, and it is the way Paulina strips away the layers from her tormenter, turning the lies into denials before finally giving way to the truth, that makes this film more than a sadomasochistic story.  This is because however stagy and contrived the script might be, the performances by Weaver and Kinglsey elevate the story.  When you finish watching this film you wonder what besides some stupid concert for political correctness kept these two from being nominated for Oscars.  Quite simply, Weaver and Kinglsey have never been better.  At the end, the reason why an ordinary man turned into such an evil fiend will chill you.

375974,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6303465846,Linda Linguvic,"[34, 34]","This 1994 film was adapted from a play by Argentinean playwright Ariel Dorfman and was directed by Roman Polanski.  Set in an unnamed South American country, three people are thrown together in an isolated house on a dark and stormy night.  The woman, played by Sigourney Weaver is clearly troubled and sad.  Her husband, played by Stuart Wilson, is late for dinner.  Turns out he had a flat tire and a stranger helped him out.  That stranger, who is a doctor, played by Ben Kingsley, soon befriends the husband.  The woman thinks the stranger is the man who tortured her while she was a political prisoner many years before.There is a new kinder and gentler government now, which is investigating atrocities from the past.  The woman's husband is in charge of the investigation, which is basically focused on identifying bodies and is giving amnesty to many of the worst criminals.  Naturally this complicates the situation.What follows is not a simple story though because, throughout, questions are raised that have no easy answers.  Is the doctor really the torturer or an innocent man?  After all, it all happened at least ten or more years in the past and the woman has never actually seen her torturer's face as she had been blindfolded the whole time.  The doctor declares his innocence.  At times, he's even charming.  But she has tied him up and is determined to get a confession out of him.There are many interwoven themes.  The basic one is wondering if the doctor is, indeed, the right man.  But then there is the relationship between the husband and the wife.  We discover he and his wife were both members of the revolution but only she was caught and tortured.  He has been trying to make that up to her for their whole marriage.  We also get to hear a lot about the details of the torture.  It is chilling and disturbing and, even though the only violence in the film is against the suspect who is tied up, the woman's prison experience, which is only talked about and not shown, is excruciatingly painful to hear about.There are other questions raised too.  What happens to a society when it gives someone power over a helpless person?  Now, we see the woman with power over the tied-up doctor. And we are forced to think about how this kind of power corrupts a whole society.  This is a concept that is universal, as fresh today as it has always been.  And the director certainly knows how to bring it out. All of the actors were sensational.  I soon forgot they were performing and was completely swept into the story.  I could feel the pain of all three characters as well as the horror of the electric shocks of the past.The title comes from a string quartet by Franz Schubert called Death and the Maiden.  This piece of music had been played during the woman's torture. She has found a tape of it in the doctor's car and plays it throughout.  It helps to frame the action, right down to the film's excellent and satisfying conclusion.I was surprised to discover that this film had won no significant awards and got little recognition when it was released.  It wasn't even given a high rating from the critics.  That's too bad.  I think that it is an important film.  I'm glad I discovered it though.  It's sad and serious and ultimately meaningful on many levels.

This is very tough stuff and can be a little depressing. There are only three people playing in this movie (this is an adaptation of a piece of theatre): the woman (Sigourney Weaver), her husband (Stuart Wilson) and the guest (Ben Kingsley). It happens in a non precised country in Latin America after the revolution, and the husband was just asked by the newly elected democratic president to chair a commission investigating the crimes of the fallen military regime.The woman is a former victim of the junta - we know she was imprisoned for years and tortured at many occasions. And then arrives the guest... and his voice seems familiar to the woman. She believes that he is the man who tortured her years ago and decides to make him pay. What happens next? Well, you will have to watch the movie, because all of this was just the beginning...All the cast is great but Sigourney Weaver is simply incredible. This is one of her most powerful performances ever - if you are a fan, you simply MUST see this movie.This is a very difficult film. If you search to have some fun and spend a nice evening, it should not be your first choice.
