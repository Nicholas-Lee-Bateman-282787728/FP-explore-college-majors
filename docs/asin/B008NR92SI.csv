1572157,A2GJXG6JMHBD60,B008NR92SI,Boomerocity,"[4, 5]","At the start the monster 1975 The Who By Numbers tour, Pete Townshend, Roger Daltrey, Keith Moon, John Entwistle,  were filmed in Houston, Texas, on November 20th of that year. The namesake of the tour was from the band's seventh album in their 10th year of existence. With Dolby Digital Stereo sound, this 117-minute 25-song bomb blast--previously only available as a muddled bootleg--has been pridefully restored to its rightful visual and sonic superiority by longtime Who collaborator Jon Astley.Filmed only five years after what arguably is the greatest live album in rock, Live At Leeds, The Who Live In Texas '75, lives up to and in some ways actually surpasses its predecessor's greatness. The Who, at that particular point in time, had achieved an unerring almost magical mystical chemistry. Between the windmilling antics of guitarist Townshend, the mic wire lasso of lead singer Daltrey, the crazed bombastic danger of drummer Moon (1946-1978) and, of course, their secret weapon, genius bassist John Entwistle (1944-2002), this was a truly revolutionary band who changed all the hard rock rules. Even the punks, in the anti-rock star era of the late `70s, loved The Who.The extensive Tommy section, the savage recreations of early hits such as My Generation (with its iconic ""hope I die before I get old"" line delivered in all its lusty nihilistic truth), the celebrated cover of Eddie Cochran's Summertime Blues, plus Baba O'Riley and Won't Get Fooled Again make this a Who fan's delight and a must-have to their video library.Boomerocity.com",5,Another Great Piece of Rock History,1351036800,"10 24, 2012",2012,1555,"['start', 'monster', '1975', 'Who', 'Numbers', 'tour', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'were', 'filmed', 'Houston', 'Texas', 'November', '20th', 'year', 'namesake', 'tour', 'was', 'band', 'seventh', 'album', '10th', 'year', 'existence', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Stereo', 'sound', '117-minute', '25-song', 'bomb', 'blast', 'previously', 'only', 'available', 'muddled', 'bootleg', 'been', 'pridefully', 'restored', 'rightful', 'visual', 'sonic', 'superiority', 'longtime', 'Who', 'collaborator', 'Jon', 'Astley.Filmed', 'only', 'five', 'years', 'what', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'live', 'album', 'rock', 'Live', 'Leeds', 'Who', 'Live', 'Texas', ""'75"", 'up', 'ways', 'actually', 'predecessor', 'greatness', 'Who', 'particular', 'point', 'time', 'had', 'achieved', 'unerring', 'almost', 'magical', 'mystical', 'chemistry', 'windmilling', 'antics', 'guitarist', 'Townshend', 'mic', 'wire', 'lasso', 'lead', 'singer', 'Daltrey', 'crazed', 'bombastic', 'danger', 'drummer', 'Moon', '1946-1978', 'course', 'secret', 'weapon', 'genius', 'bassist', 'John', 'Entwistle', '1944-2002', 'was', 'truly', 'revolutionary', 'band', 'who', 'changed', 'hard', 'rock', 'rules', 'Even', 'punks', 'anti-rock', 'star', 'era', 'late', '70s', 'loved', 'Who.The', 'extensive', 'Tommy', 'section', 'savage', 'recreations', 'early', 'hits', 'such', 'Generation', 'iconic', 'hope', 'die', 'get', 'old', 'line', 'delivered', 'lusty', 'nihilistic', 'truth', 'celebrated', 'cover', 'Eddie', 'Cochran', 'Summertime', 'Blues', 'Baba', ""O'Riley"", 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Fooled', 'Again', 'make', 'Who', 'fan', 'delight', 'must-have', 'video', 'library.Boomerocity.com']",N/A

Keith Moon appears to be at a peak here, but I find his drumming to be terribly tiring to listen to. He never stops, but he plays pretty much the same on every song. There's no taste, no dynamics. Everything is flat out. He is all constant tom tom rolls and cymbal crashes, but none of it means anything because of its non-stop movement. You do see some John Entwistle here, contrary to other reviews. He doesn't do anything anyways. He stands like a statue, but I suppose the bass fiends want to see his hands. Roger Daltrey is still decked out in his 1969 Woodstock fringe, some six years later. I don't know if this was still in style in 1975. Pete wears is trademark white suit, and does the usual windmills etc. They perform a number of deeply boring songs from their then-current album, The Who By Numbers, today considered to be among their weakest.The camera angles are limited, and the sound is not in synch. Keith is hitting his snare drum a second or two after the sound recording. If you're a drummer, like me, you'll find that disconcerting.I fell asleep about 30 mins into this.

1572163,A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ,B008NR92SI,George Waters,"[0, 0]","Long available as a bootleg video, this amazing gem from 1975 shows The Who as a band starting to splinter apart, but still delivering that unique Who sound - a majestic roar akin to a jet plane getting ready for and then achieving take-off. Yes, the video quality is not up to what we would expect from a more recent live show, but this recording was not initially planned to be released. The recording is nearly 40 years old, and while the video is only slightly improved from the bootlegs, the audio has been significantly upgraded.Looking at this release on its own merits, it is fascinating. Sadly, this tour was the last before Keith Moon began his final descent into addiction. His performance is enjoyably typical of Moon the Loon - roaring drumming that almost sounds like singing the lyrics, and that manic stage presence that only Keith had. Roger Daltrey is still in his post-Tommy sex god of rock and roll role, kicking his lyrics out with a spit and a swagger. John Entwistle is, well, John Entwistle - completely focused on his one-of-a-kind thundering bass lines without regard for stage theatrics. And Pete Townshend is, as always, his chatty, chord-crunching, insecure, and authentic self. The performances are booming, soul-wrenching, and hard driving. And with this DVD, we are treated to a couple of rarely-heard live gems: ""However Much I Booze"" and ""Dreaming From The Waist"", two masterpieces from the vastly under-rated The Who By Numbers. Sometimes referred to as ""Townshend's suicide note"", By Numbers is one of my favorite albums and it is awesome to hear these two tracks performed live. (I don't really care for ""Squeeze Box"", but seeing the other two tracks from By Numbers performed live makes up for that)The rest of the set simmers, including a set from ""Tommy"" that is a sheer joy, a rollicking ""Won't Get Fooled Again"", and a blistering ""Naked Eye"".

At that time I felt that it was the best example of a classic Who concert.  While that may still be true to some degree, I must give a slight edge to this performance for one simple reason:  the setlist.Isle of Wight took place in 1970.  But The Who's true genius, or shall I say the album that I feel launched them into classic rock legend status, came in 1971.  Yes, ""Tommy"" was brilliant and we can't ignore the early hits by any measure, but ""Who's Next"" is what I consider to be their finest hour, with ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia"" following close behind.Here we get a partial performance of ""Tommy"" but we also get tracks from ""Who's Next"" and other then-recent works.  This adds a better representation of what the classic lineup were capable of doing, and a better selection of the big hits (namely ""Baba O'Riley"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"") that remain fan favorites and classic rock anthems today.And may I add, The Who are on fire here.  They simply rock, pure and simple.  The sheer energy that comes from the stage is phenomenal and power-packed.

1572174,A1SA5D0QD4GZEI,B008NR92SI,Raven Shaddock,"[7, 8]","This DVD is more like a high class bootleg or a low budget professional recording.For the first 4 numbers the camera is shot from only one side of the stage. At first I thought is that it?no other angles but finally they actually shoot from the other side & zoom in time to time.Other thing is the stop action or freeze frame & the slow motion effect as the song is going on.What's that the special effects? Leave it alone & let's see them perform.They're so busy w/ the effects they miss the part where Pete leaps across the stage as Daltrey screams near the endof ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" instead you just see Pete landing behind Roger.Keith Moon is funny as you can hear him talking in between songs over Pete.One part he comes from behind the drums to front stage taking the mike from Roger saying""I like to play 17 songs from my new album""It's an amazing show and to see the original band perform is great. I never had the chance to see them live.I like these tracks better than the ones on Isle of Wight 1970 DVD. That was too much Tommy for me.They do one song from Quadrophenia which is Drowned. I wish they did a few more. 3 songs from Who By Numbers.A small block of Tommy songs. I really like ""Sparks"" performance. It's an instrumental I always loved that track.

The band plays with passion and fire like only The Who can.  It has some bum notes here and there but that has always been part of the appeal of The Who and why some have labelled them the Godfathers of Punk.  It's true Rock and Roll before over processed guitars ruled the day and ruined the true feel and essence of Rock.  What's great about this concert to me, is the fact that we get a few songs off of The Who by Numbers album, including the bass driven ""Dreaming from the Waist"" to the introspective ""However Much I Booze"".
