I had no idea what I was missing, because when this originally aired ABC had it in a terrible time slot so I never had the chance to catch it. Nevertheless, if you are a fan of Drama, you have to pick this up.  It is in JJA's fashion where the drama can be intense and over the top yet feel completely REAL and believable.  Sort of like the 2nd Season of Grey's Anatomy was.  I hate what Grey's has turned out to be now, and I am sad I didn't know about ""Brian"" sooner.

Serious when it needed to be but lighthearted when appropriate. The show was about a group of friends which meant different stories but the center of it was their bond to each other.I was a big fan of those show and very sad when it was officially cancelled. I recorded the episode every week and always looked forward to the next.This set has pretty cool extras with behind-the-scenes and an unaired episode.

1069207,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B000P6YNT8,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[1, 4]","Since I got into Lost and loved the last couple of movies, I had been lulled into a trust for JJ Abrams productions. However, I never did like Felicity and Alias never sparked my interest. I was remembering these shows when I was watching this tedious little number.At first it shows promise as a multi-character piece in which the one single character (Brian) stands in sharp contrast to his friends who are all married or engaged. Even though Brian has the desperate wanderlust of Ted from .How I Met Your Mother: Season Onehe is not quite as unhappy as his friends who must deal with the doubts and tribulations of staying married. Patricia Arquette has a miscarriage in the pilot and wants to get married. Brian's best friend is marrying Marjorie who Brian loves. The married couple wants to have an open relationship but neither is sure they can carry it off.That's the first episode in a nutshell.Unfortunately, that's the next four episodes after that. The married couple have fights over the open relationship and get jealous until finally one fools around. Brian has sex with a gorgeous woman, but he's really in love with Marjorie. Marjorie says that she's in love with Brian but she's staying with his friend. And Patricia Arquette tries to have a baby.Even though the second season (after the first five episodes) varies it up a little, the characters have become terrible bores by this time and they are too despicable to stay with. Every single one is a whiny self-involved idiot. Every single one is preoccupied with personal crap. And every single one is awful. Well one isn't as bad since he has the good sense to die around episode 12 but sadly, he's the only one. The rest of these characters stay alive until the last horrible little episode of this horrible little show.",2,Just plods along without much to show for it.,1259020800,"11 24, 2009",2009,1791,"['got', 'Lost', 'loved', 'last', 'couple', 'movies', 'had', 'been', 'lulled', 'trust', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'productions', 'However', 'never', 'did', 'Felicity', 'Alias', 'never', 'sparked', 'interest', 'was', 'remembering', 'shows', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'tedious', 'little', 'number.At', 'first', 'promise', 'multi-character', 'piece', 'one', 'single', 'character', 'Brian', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'married', 'engaged', 'Even', 'Brian', 'desperate', 'wanderlust', 'Ted', '.How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'Season', 'Onehe', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'unhappy', 'friends', 'who', 'must', 'deal', 'doubts', 'tribulations', 'staying', 'married', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'miscarriage', 'pilot', 'get', 'married', 'Brian', 'best', 'friend', 'marrying', 'Marjorie', 'who', 'Brian', 'married', 'couple', 'have', 'open', 'relationship', 'sure', 'can', 'carry', 'first', 'episode', 'nutshell.Unfortunately', 'next', 'four', 'episodes', 'married', 'couple', 'have', 'fights', 'open', 'relationship', 'get', 'jealous', 'finally', 'one', 'fools', 'around', 'Brian', 'sex', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'really', 'love', 'Marjorie', 'Marjorie', 'love', 'Brian', 'staying', 'friend', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'have', 'baby.Even', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'varies', 'up', 'little', 'characters', 'have', 'become', 'terrible', 'bores', 'time', 'are', 'too', 'despicable', 'stay', 'single', 'one', 'whiny', 'self-involved', 'idiot', 'single', 'one', 'preoccupied', 'personal', 'crap', 'single', 'one', 'awful', 'Well', 'one', ""n't"", 'bad', 'good', 'sense', 'die', 'episode', '12', 'sadly', 'only', 'one', 'rest', 'characters', 'stay', 'alive', 'last', 'horrible', 'little', 'episode', 'horrible', 'little', 'show']",What About Brian - The Complete Series
1069208,A1WSFHRBY2ZD1R,B000P6YNT8,"T. Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[25, 25]","This series initially started two different ways: J.J. Abrams (creator of ""Lost"" and ""Alias"") trying to go back to his roots of simple relationship drama (year ago he created the WB hit ""Felicity""); as well as Jeff Judah and Jason Katism (of ""Life as We Know It"" and ""Freaks and Geeks"" fame) trying to produce a show with their signature quirks, yet one with a premise appealing enough were they wouldn't get cancelled after 13 episodes.  And so ""What about Brian"" was born.The show was simple enough: Brian (Barry Watson from ""7th Heaven"") is a serial-dater that has never been able to keep a girlfriend around longer than several weeks.  Upon the engagement of his best-friend he finds himself as a 7th-wheel among his closest friends (including his college roommate/business partner and his much-older sister).  The series follows as Brian tries to search out love, as well as the various romantic entanglements/problems that his various friends find themselves in such as: affairs, new business ventures, single-parenthood, engagement, etc..  Essentially the show was about a group of early thirty-something's trying to not only make their mark on the world, but trying to share their success with ""that someone special"" and all the hilarity and heartache that comes with the territory.Unfortunately for the creators and ABC, while the premise was interesting, the actors/characters likable, their was always something missing from the series.  That special SPARK that a series needs in order to find itself on the lineup for the better part of a decade was missing.  After airing 6 our of the produced 8 for its first season the network pulled the show, re-staffed a majority of the producers/writers, fired an actors/hired three additional actors... basically all in an effort to make the show what it could be.  And while yes, the second season is an immensely pleasing 19-episode arc ultimately the series was doomed from the beginning.  And like similar shows of the past (such as ""once and again"" which had many of the same producers) the show was never able to find a following and it was canceled due to low-ratings.That is not to say the show is bad in any way.  In fact it's highly enjoyable, its just easy to tell why people would prefer to watch it in one or two sittings, vs. weekly over the course of a year.  Presented here on 5 DVDs are all 25 aired episodes (the 2 unaired episodes leftover from season 1 are not included) along with deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes interviews.",4,What about Brian?,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,2503,"['series', 'initially', 'started', 'two', 'different', 'ways', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'creator', 'Lost', 'Alias', 'trying', 'go', 'back', 'roots', 'simple', 'relationship', 'drama', 'year', 'ago', 'created', 'WB', 'hit', 'Felicity', 'as', 'well', 'Jeff', 'Judah', 'Jason', 'Katism', 'Life', 'Know', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'fame', 'trying', 'produce', 'show', 'signature', 'quirks', 'yet', 'one', 'premise', 'appealing', 'enough', 'were', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'cancelled', '13', 'episodes', 'so', 'What', 'Brian', 'was', 'born.The', 'show', 'was', 'simple', 'enough', 'Brian', 'Barry', 'Watson', '7th', 'Heaven', 'serial-dater', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'keep', 'girlfriend', 'around', 'longer', 'several', 'weeks', 'engagement', 'best-friend', '7th-wheel', 'closest', 'friends', 'including', 'college', 'roommate/business', 'partner', 'much-older', 'sister', 'series', 'Brian', 'search', 'out', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'various', 'romantic', 'entanglements/problems', 'various', 'friends', 'find', 'such', 'affairs', 'new', 'business', 'ventures', 'single-parenthood', 'engagement', 'Essentially', 'show', 'was', 'group', 'early', 'thirty-something', 'trying', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'mark', 'world', 'trying', 'share', 'success', 'someone', 'special', 'hilarity', 'heartache', 'territory.Unfortunately', 'creators', 'ABC', 'premise', 'was', 'interesting', 'actors/characters', 'likable', 'was', 'always', 'something', 'missing', 'series', 'special', 'SPARK', 'series', 'order', 'find', 'lineup', 'better', 'part', 'decade', 'was', 'missing', 'airing', '6', 'produced', '8', 'first', 'season', 'network', 'pulled', 'show', 're-staffed', 'majority', 'producers/writers', 'fired', 'actors/hired', 'three', 'additional', 'actors', 'basically', 'effort', 'make', 'show', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'yes', 'second', 'season', 'immensely', 'pleasing', '19-episode', 'arc', 'ultimately', 'series', 'was', 'doomed', 'beginning', 'similar', 'shows', 'past', 'such', 'once', 'again', 'had', 'many', 'same', 'producers', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'find', 'following', 'was', 'canceled', 'due', 'low-ratings.That', 'not', 'say', 'show', 'bad', 'way', 'fact', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'easy', 'tell', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'prefer', 'watch', 'one', 'two', 'sittings', 'vs.', 'weekly', 'course', 'year', 'Presented', 'here', '5', 'DVDs', 'are', '25', 'aired', 'episodes', '2', 'unaired', 'episodes', 'leftover', 'season', '1', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'interviews']",What About Brian - The Complete Series
